274618,Mike Pike,2008-12-02 20:54:00,1332,You Muskie guys are behaving like a bunch of Steelheaders!
274628,Stoty,2008-12-02 21:11:00,2910,"Holy crap...this is unreal.  To the guy who caught it...... AWESOME JOB! No matter if its a record or not, WOW! To the ""negative"" guys......... Suck it up, put your JEALOUSY aside and SHUT UP!  (Jealousy -  typically refers to the negative thoughts and feelings of insecurity, fear, and anxiety that occur when a person believes a valued relationship is being threatened by a rival.)  Man oh man....its like a dang children's nursery on this site sometimes. Yap, yap, yap.  Like the one guy said.... don't you guys ever fish?? If you spent a tenth of the time fishing as you do CHIRPING on here...maybe you too would catch a decent fish and be able to post about it!"
274634,Rich,2008-12-02 21:23:00,3927," He wasn't handing YOU the money. If I pulled out a wad of 5000 bucks in bills and you grabbed it from me and started to count it, I'd smack ya in the teeth!"
274641,forrest,2008-12-02 21:36:00,1032," LOL Don't go around shouting you have $5000 in your pocket....its a sure way to get mugged. If I was foolish enough to swipe $5000 bucks from you I think i would run before counting.  I know what happened to that perch, it only took your bait:  "
274654,Greencoachdog,2008-12-02 21:50:00,8163,"Thanks for the abuse men!... it's much appreciated!!!  Ol' Yeller has had laryngitis for the past couple of days and I felt I was ""lacking"".       ... y'all keep practicing, and one day you may become as good at it as Spiel!!!"
274664,holdfast,2008-12-02 22:11:00,1813,"I cant help this.  He HA Lets Party  Pull out the Confederate flags, Lock up your Women. Run to the Planet of the Apes. The Red Necks are a comin. "
274675,tonka-toy,2008-12-02 22:30:00,139,"Forrest' I originally posted about a rumour of a big fish being being caught the day before, at that time Ididn't know the fish had been released.I did not compare it to a world record,I was interested in the rumour because at 57x33 it should of been bigger than the current world record. After reading all your comments on the various posts since then,I am left wondering what it was that got you so fired up in the first place."
274684,Greencoachdog,2008-12-02 22:58:00,8163,"   I know it...  I'm so vile, I have to hold a gun to my head in the morning when I shave to keep from slitting my own throat!"
274686,MCTFisher9120,2008-12-02 23:10:00,3761, lol
274687,MCTFisher9120,2008-12-02 23:11:00,3761, Nice lol
274698,Squid,2008-12-02 23:37:00,1656,"I think that you are awesome Glen, you fit right in with the rest of us."
274709,Pete Maina,2008-12-03 00:00:00,213,"Hi,  See the news of the monster is all over. I think awesome that he let it go and ... neat to see the release shots.  Can understand why folks would want precise measurements and possibly photos-of, as it is a fish of very significant caliber ... IMO it is over 60 lbs. quite certainly ... but release is release too. The whole idea of the decision is for the fish to survive the experience and thrive. Because of that, more measuring and photo documentation-of in the dark would significantly lengthen the process - and make the decision moot.  I've looked at lots of muskie photos (and lots that didn't seem quite right) ... it would seem to me it is what it is.  Great pic forrest ... love the red neks there too.  Pete"
274714,Beats,2008-12-03 00:10:00,543,"It would be cool if that fish had somehow been tagged with some kind of micro-something or other to be able to tell if it is caught again...even bigger.  I always liked the line from the movie ""Big Fish"" where he says, ""the biggest fish gets to be that way by never being caught"".  Makes you wonder what's out there.  Releasing this fish will do more for the fishery than any record ever would."
274730,forrest,2008-12-03 00:33:00,1032," Hi Pete,  LOL That pic the action angling guy/board member Rich doing some fine acting: http://www.actionanglingtv.com/  I can think of at least 2 digital camera measurement tools that are relatively new ideas...modify them, test them, market them.....   I know its doable, your a man that could make it happen.  With Regards,  Mike"
274745,Greencoachdog,2008-12-03 00:58:00,8163, Pipe down forrest... yer stealin' all my abuse!!!   ... go start yer own thread if you want some abuse!!!
274750,Pete Maina,2008-12-03 01:05:00,213,"Hi,  Ha ha ... hey GCD ... certainly understand the desire to know exactly how big a fish like that is too.  Mike, great stuff ... love Rich's acting. Very interesting ideas you have there on the camera measurement tools. If it doesn't prolong anything, why not? Sounds like a good idea to me.  Agree Beats"
274894,cram,2008-12-03 06:56:00,1733,interesting thread on the muskyhunter messageboard about what the fish would weigh...http://www.muskyhunter.com/forums/generalforum/14548.html
274557,forrest,2008-12-02 18:46:00,1032, Again you distort the facts but thats part of what you do: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_troll  -I compared the rumor of a world record muskie before the pic was posted to that of the sasquatch being found -I edit a lot of responses immediately after posting to fix mistakes.....not later on to distort an argument.    stop speculating with zero facts thats what trolls do. -thats right...he is not making the claim on this board....he IS making the claim.  Someone else is making the claim for them. -Why would he not feel welcome?  No one is calling him a liar......just the catcher of a monster.  forrest
274558,Clampet,2008-12-02 18:47:00,1947,"Hey, I resent that! No one can cause a disturbance as well as I do!"
274559,Clampet,2008-12-02 18:51:00,1947,"I could not agree more! On a big fish like that, it would be in one's best interest (and curiosity fer that matter) to take two quick photos of the fish's length and girth."
274561,johnnyb,2008-12-02 18:58:00,3413," That's what Lunker Larry said on page 2 of the ""here's a pic for the naysayers"" thread...seems to me to be a reasonable explanation as to why we see no pics of the measuring tape...I do believe Larry has been in more contact with the fellow who caught it than just message board stuff abck and forth."
274567,Raf,2008-12-02 19:06:00,3495,do you guys even fish?
274568,cram,2008-12-02 19:08:00,1733," Forrest, let me remind you of some of the things you said.....  - you compared the claim to.....nigerian scam emails, Elvis is still alive!, sasquatch, mermaids, and aliens - you called it a loser thread, and wished ""loser threads""  had their own category so you wouldn't have to see them - you called me ignorant for looking forward to further news on the reported catch - ""it is fiction, i will say it again - it is fiction""  I think you tasted a little crow when the pic was posted (tough to get the feather bits out of your teeth, huh?), but even then you went after the guy for not taking/posting pics of the measuring tape beside the fish.  I mean, come on."
274572,Marty,2008-12-02 19:16:00,873,That's enough.   Take it to email or pm from here on in.   All further bickering will be deleted.
274576,rickster,2008-12-02 19:23:00,495,Thank you Marty
