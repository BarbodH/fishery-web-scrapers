Temp: + 3 degrees Water clarity: +3 ft visibility Lure used: Cotton Cordel Diver plug. Chartreuse colored. It also got snagged and I lost the lure( ouch!) after few more attempt. Also tried grubs but no luck afterwards; Fish caught: 8-10lb Lake trout. It was release after picture taken. I Fish from 9:30am -2:00pm. The whole place was slippery from previous night rain.  Got there at 9:30am. Caught the fish after my third cast. The Trout hardly fought. I was a touch too late in showing up, hard to be motivated to wake up early, when my other fishing buddy called in sick, and was not able to make it today. Fish got less active(not jumping anymore) by 10:00am.  I spoke to other anglers and we all agree that fishing is better before 10:00am.  I will be there early next week."
