Trombly's couldn't be bothered to get back to me, LEI not available in Canada.. etc.. so I gave up with local and if gonna wait for it to be shipped may as well hit ebay.  Hit Ebay and ordered from these guys just 6 days ago. Picked it up today at the post office. Can't beat that service. This is just an FYI for those that fear vendors on Ebay... this one's legit and great service to boot.  They have Garmin/Lowrance/Humminbird/Vexilar etc. Adapters/power cords/transducers/mounts etc.  http://stores.ebay.com/fishelectronics  They've been in business since 1980 !"

Found out yesterday that Marcum doesn't honour their warranty if you bought the unit off an online auction.  Thank God mine works fine.  Just wanted to add that if anyone is buying a costly product on ebay, they should make sure the vendor is an ""official"" dealer of the product.  If not, chances are you are going to be S.O.L. if something brakes or goes wrong with it."
