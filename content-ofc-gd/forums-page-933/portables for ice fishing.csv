274616,cram,2008-12-02 20:53:00,1733,How un-usable are traditional portable fishfinders for winter use?  Do the LCD screens freeze that easily?  I may only get to fish 2 or 3 days this winter....not sure i want to buy a separate unit for icefishing..
274621,BUSTER,2008-12-02 20:59:00,1336,"well i cant say iam not with you ,except i'd like to fish alot more this winter ..cant say i didnt think about this too"
274627,misfish,2008-12-02 21:08:00,29133,I have never used a winter type finder. I used the one from my boats for years. Never had an issue.
274629,Dano,2008-12-02 21:15:00,719,"I have a Lowrance x67 LCD and I have not had any problems with it yet, and I am usually not in a hut either, though I hope to change that this year."
274635,misfish,2008-12-02 21:24:00,29133,If your wondering about a battery for it.I use them 12volt gel cells you can get out of the emergency light exit signs. You can also get them at Princess auto for about 10 bucks or so. Best to use a 1.5 charger on them. I was lucky enough to come across a chager meant just for them.

274648,Dano,2008-12-02 21:45:00,719,"That the day I got my hickey Wayne? Lol, the metal rings from my sled helmet strap burned my neck, I told Fern Wayne was extra frisky that weekend."
274650,Ramble,2008-12-02 21:46:00,713,Didn't you get the memo Irish? hats were invented a while back. They'll keep heat in and prevent freezing. I'm betting you got the pants memo tho right? haha  -R-
274652,Rich,2008-12-02 21:46:00,3927,"Been using my Humminbird 100SX for ice fishing for 10 years now every winter, in temps down to -25, no hut. Never had it freeze up, and batteries usually last all winter.  I have the settings so basic that the delay is only about half a second, and it picks up my lure on the graph."
274658,irishfield,2008-12-02 21:53:00,26272, HAHA... I had a sled helmut on I'll let you know... with a toque on under it !
