I was not planning to go because i was on night shift...but the weather was so nice and the lake so close...why not, could still get a few hours sleep before work.     GORGEOUS DAY AND NOT FAR TO GO....WHY NOT!        ICE IS GETTING THICKER TOO......WAS THREE INCHES IN THE SAME SPOT A FEW DAYS AGO....NOW 6"".....NICE BLACK ICE TOO                GOT ONE NICE PIKE JUST BEFORE I PACKED IT IN.....NICE MINI SESSION.        I worked back to back night shifts...so was gonna be pretty tired today....but i seem to be able to tough it out....lololol...its not hard.....ITS FISHING!  So i hooked up with my fishing buddies Dave and Chuck and we headed off to try a lake just further down from Burr Lake where i have been going a lot recently. However by the time they pulled up at my place it was gone midday, by the time we hit the logging road it was 1:30pm....so we decided to go to Burr Lake again as none of us has fished the other lake and did not have time really to explore it.       CHUCK GOT THE FIRST FISH OF THE DAY>>>A REALLY FAT PERCH        AND THE FIRST WALTER        THE BITE WAS PRETTY CONSTANT FOR THE 3 HOURS OR SO WE WERE THERE        AND WE GOT OUR 3 MAN LIMIT BY 4PM....THEN THE BITE ALL BUT DIED        AND AS USUAL SOMEONE FORGOT TO BRING PLASTIC BAGS. ....LOL        A nice few hours ice fishing from this week....heres to many more hours this winter.    PS....Jeeeeze was it ever cold today"
275228,Beats,2008-12-04 01:55:00,543,nice lookin' fish.  Can't beat that for convenience.  Who needs a plastic bag when the fish are frozen solid?
275231,rickster,2008-12-04 01:58:00,495,Dammit Simon I told you til stop fishing there until I got up there at the end of the month theres gonna be none left for me  LOL  Great to see you got em again  Rick
275243,Wild,2008-12-04 02:14:00,704,Work? You guys actually work up there and night shifts even? Well this puts a whole new perspective on the idea of moving up there
275262,purekgw,2008-12-04 02:50:00,585,ahhhhh now i want some walleye
275264,muskyhunter5150,2008-12-04 02:53:00,64,I know about forgetting the plastic bag. One time i had a bunch og crappies and had to make a bag out of a sweater. haha
275269,Joey,2008-12-04 03:05:00,9122,"That's awesome Simon.  That ice is so clear, its beautiful  Nice haul, what time's dinner  Joey"
275273,brkygetr,2008-12-04 03:19:00,425,Very nice....you gotta love the early ice walleye bite....  Have a good day at work tommorrow
275276,kemper,2008-12-04 03:27:00,2232,I am so unbelieveably jealous that you can walk out your front door to that
275277,WeedLine,2008-12-04 03:28:00,322,Thats a cool looking pike.
275299,tjsa,2008-12-04 04:17:00,1578,"I have had to put my back pack into the washing machine a few times,   :lol: Damn double bagging does not work in summer, winter, no issue, just toss em' into the sleigh or pack after they have stiffened up a bit."
275326,Greencoachdog,2008-12-04 11:31:00,8163,"Great report and pics Simon!!!  With the fish frozen solid like that, you should be able to stack and haul them like cord wood!  Nice mess of fish too!"
275345,bushart,2008-12-04 12:53:00,2628,That's a decent catch for Burr Lake in winter.  Maybe Pickeral Lake or Ingall Lake would put out a few bigger fish.  Bushart
275350,corvette1,2008-12-04 13:01:00,1765,awesome day
275377,bushart,2008-12-04 13:34:00,2628,Oh yeah---Forgot to say---Old Timer stringer---take a willow branch--couple feet long---through the gills--out the mouth---hold a few fish--may save the fishy smellin packsack  Bushart
275378,smbhunter,2008-12-04 13:39:00,186,That pike has some very unusual markings on it. Great day on the ice. Can't wait for the safe ice down here.
275382,Leecher,2008-12-04 13:43:00,7832,"Great report and pics Simon  MAAANNN your....... I'm not going to finish this sentence, you know the rest Good job you guys on the walters Looked like a nice day to be out on ice Thanks for sharing Leechman"
275551,Abberz,2008-12-04 21:28:00,140,The second to last picture with the limit of walleye on the ice is what ice fishing is all about.    Hope you guys enjoyed the meal!   Hard water can't come soon enough!
275596,misfish,2008-12-04 23:55:00,29133,I see what you mean Tom  Nice haul Simon.
