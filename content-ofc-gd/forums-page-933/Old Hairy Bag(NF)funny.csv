There was no shortage of extremely young idealistic ladies in attendance, one of whom approached the Chief for conversation. ""Excuse me, Chief, but you seem to be a very serious man. Is something bothering you?"" ""Negative, ma'am. Just serious by nature."" The young lady looked at his awards and decorations and said, ""It looks like you have seen a lot of action."" ""Yes, ma'am, a lot of action."" The young lady, tiring of trying to start up a conversation, said, ""You know, you should lighten up a little. Relax and enjoy yourself."" The Chief just stared at her in his serious manner. Finally the young lady said, ""You know, I hope you don't take this the wrong way, but when is the last time you had sex?"" "" 1955, ma'am."" ""Well, there you are. No wonder you're so serious. You really need to chill out! I mean, no sex sin ce 1955! She took his hand and led him to a private room where she proceeded to ""relax"" him several times. Afterwards, panting for breath, she leaned against his bare chest and said, ""Wow, you sure didn't forget much since 1955.""  The Chief said in his serious voice, after glancing at his watch, ""I hope not ; it's only 2130 now."""

274523,Fisherman,2008-12-02 16:43:00,7201,"Kinda makes me wonder, I thought hairy bags (anchor clankers) used ""bells"" instead of army time.  Lew should know.."
274531,Roy,2008-12-02 17:26:00,13728,"They used the ""army"" 24 hour clock. Bells were there for  men who couldn't afford a personal timepiece. Midnight= 8 bells  12:30 = 1 bell, 01:00 = 2 bells, 01:30 = 3 bells etc.... the end of the watch at 04:00 was 8 bells which is why we hear ""Eight bells and all's well""  If they wanted more accurate time, they would have needed a personal timepiece.  I mean,  how would they have said 04:02 ? Eight bells and two tinkles? That would have just been wrong to say on board."
274536,lew,2008-12-02 17:45:00,12767,"Actually, the only bell that had any real importance and basically the only one that the boyz paid any attention to was ""UP SPIRITS"" at 11:30 AM  Course, that was way back in the good ole days"
