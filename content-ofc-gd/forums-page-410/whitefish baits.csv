694710,love2fishhave2work,2012-05-10 00:08:00,212,I will try to give whitefish a go this year and need to go out and buy some tackle.  Would love whatever suggestions I can get on the board to avoid wasting money on useless stuff.  Much appreciated ahead of time.
694714,davey buoy,2012-05-10 00:11:00,5505,  Shoal digger or similar jig with salted tubes . Works wonders
694716,Joeytier,2012-05-10 00:12:00,3990,"White tube and creepers/bad boys jigged right on bottom.  Jig slowly, stirring up the bottom and wait for the freight train!"
694717,jerdog,2012-05-10 00:15:00,39,"the williams ice jig works as good in the spring as it does in the summer.  small jigging, practically just wiggling it on bottom, not the big sweeping jigging motion."
694744,NANUK,2012-05-10 01:44:00,797,"Another vote for Shoal Digger jigs, the best quality in that style (weight forward) jigs, tipped with a micro tube. Williams half & half Or just a live minnow sitting at the bottom"
694748,Sinker,2012-05-10 01:59:00,8692,"You only need 3 lures.  A green/black shoal digger with 2"" tube A #60 williams whitefish ice jig in half/half hammered with side hooks on A #7-9 jigging rap in firetiger  If you can't catch a whitie on that, your not going to catch them on anything.  Don't jig like a madman. Take it easy, and make your lures dance. They will eat it. You don't have to snag them like the rest of the yahoos. Keep an eye on your electronics, and make them chase your lure until they smash it!  S."
