New to the area and having some trouble finding fish.  I went out with my oldest son today.  We tried from 25 feet out to 60 feet and not a bite.  We were using live minnows on drop shot.  To be honest, not even sure if I marked anything... There were some "" clumps"" on the bottom, but no arches.  I would really like to get into some.  Thanks in advance for any help.  PM me if preferred."

693750,Fish Farmer,2012-05-07 11:23:00,2234,"Those clumps are what your looking for. You don't get a arch with a bunch of fish close to the bottom, just a cloud or when you see the bottom line get thick. If your anchored and a single fish appears on your screen, you'll get a strait line near the bottom. This happens a lot when fishing Simcoe for Whities or L.Trout. Some times you have to use Zoom to get a better mark."
693779,sneak_e_pete,2012-05-07 13:11:00,540,Ok... Good info.  Thanks.  Is drop shot a good method?
693797,grimsbylander,2012-05-07 14:03:00,3016,"Sneak_e_Pete,  You're on the right track and drop shotting is a great method for perch. Plastics will work but minnows is the perferred bait. Also, Erie is a huge body of water so don't be shy when looking for perch...look for the packs of boats as a starting point. From there you can mark fish and get busy. Here is a picture of what you're looking for.  "

693839,ch312,2012-05-07 15:53:00,1590,"don't hold out and keep driving around looking for schools on bottom or you'll be missing a bunch of great fish and action. just like many other species, schools of big perch are often suspended and nowhere near bottom. fishing on bottom is easier, but many times the biguns are higher in the water column just waiting to be tossed in the bucket by a savvy angler  a dropshot rig and minnow is great for feeling bites in the deeper water. i prefer 8 lb power pro with a 4-6 lb flourocarbon leader on my ultralight rod. you can feel the fish fart near your bait"
694631,sneak_e_pete,2012-05-09 19:17:00,540,"One more question.  When you find them...do you anchor, or just drift over them repeatedly?"
694641,dave524,2012-05-09 19:47:00,4508, Anchor! better have 150 feet preferably 200 feet of anchor line and chain rode.
