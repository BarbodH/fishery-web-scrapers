693743,skeeter,2012-05-07 10:38:00,1907,"I put the boat to bed last fall and every thing worked . This weekend I get it ready to go back in . I changed the gear oil in it, then drop it in the lake. Fires up no problem. Then put it into reverse, and nothing. It goes into forward. Every thing under the hood looks fine and moves the way it should.  Second problem is that the ball on the gas line keeps going soft and loosing its prime. It's not the tank or the line as I have tried 4 different tanks and lines on it and it is the same result.  :dunno:"
693752,raysfish2005,2012-05-07 11:40:00,163,"OOOOhh the fun......ok first you have a small air leak in the line ...could be the seal at the tank ot at the ball, next check your linkage to the gears ....Im assuming you didnt see and oil flow comming from the gear case?."
693763,krixxer,2012-05-07 12:29:00,274,I just went down this path.  fuel: I had a tiny crack in the fuel line after the fuel filter. 20 min to replace 3 hours to locate  Reverse: When I shift the RPM's went up but the gear failed to engage. This is tough one but likely related to linkage adjustment. 20 min to take it apart 3 hours to find the sweet spot where it all works just about perfect..   A lot of blood sweat and beer this weekend... but I'm ready now!!! just a few more days
693775,Garnet,2012-05-07 13:04:00,2056,Get a spray bottle with water and dish soap. pump the ball up and spray your hose ball and all connections

So it must be a fuel line on the engine or the connector for the fuel line on the engine.  ""..Im assuming you didnt see and oil flow comming from the gear case?. "" Nope, no oil flow."
694115,Twocoda,2012-05-08 02:29:00,4130,Krixxer- love the blood sweat and beer comment...  Skeeter- love the new avatar  but the other one was equally as hilarious   Good Luck with prob...hope ya get it sorted out with just a little blood sweat and beer
694365,Tybo,2012-05-08 21:20:00,1373,Will the engine lock into place when it`s in reverse.Can not tilt engine up.
694391,skeeter,2012-05-08 23:36:00,1907,The engine has never locked when in reverse. If I give'r gas it will pop up.
694405,Tybo,2012-05-09 00:19:00,1373,"Manual tillers have a mechanism to prevent the engine going into too reverse gear if not lock down. If you want to bring it by,I`ll take a look."
694429,skeeter,2012-05-09 01:16:00,1907,"Thanks Paul, I will let you know."
