She's scheduled to go into the spa in November for a complete face lift but until then she needs a little skin treatment so she looks good enough to show off in public.       Any recommendations to bring back the shine? Hoping for some suggestions where I don't have to travel long distance to pick up product (I'm in Mississauga). She's a painted aluminum hull. General appearance is good condition with a couple of battle scars.  Thx,  Simon"

Grab a electric polisher and pre wax cleaner, clay bar, wax and sealer and you should be able to get her looking good. Check out your local car & truck detailing shops for some pro info on what you need to do and advise on products to use."
694870,DanD,2012-05-10 15:01:00,2223,"3M makes an excellent finishing compound called “Finesse-it” Part number 05928. This stuff is great for buffing out small scratches and getting oxidation off most any type of finish and it leaves as good as any wax shine, after it is buffed off. Most automotive body shop suppliers should have or could order the stuff. It says it’s meant to be used with a buffing machine but I’ve used it number of times with just good old elbow grease and it works pretty good.  Dan. "
694883,dave524,2012-05-10 15:56:00,4508," That looks good as it contains no wax or silicone, be very careful what you use if you are going to have it repainted in the fall, any residual stuff like wax and silcon causes havoc with adhesion and quality of any new paint. It really don't look too bad, I'd just clean it and a very mild abrasive buffing."

695123,krixxer,2012-05-11 01:56:00,274,when you are buffing the paint just use plenty of water to keep things cool.  for better cutting on the yellow stuff use a wool buffing pad.

But first Simon bring it over and will put boat and trailer up on the hoist and and give the hull a power wash with the hotsy"
