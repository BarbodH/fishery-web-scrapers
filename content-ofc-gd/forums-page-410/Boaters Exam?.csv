694629,beerman,2012-05-09 19:17:00,118,Do you have to take this exam if your going on a fly in trip?
694633,DRIFTER_016,2012-05-09 19:20:00,10439,"No, as you are actually renting the boat. Rentals are exempt from needing to have the boating card. Plus it's not like you'll see any one any how.  LOL"
694635,beerman,2012-05-09 19:23:00,118,"Thanks.  Honestly, we have had the Fish Commission land on our lakes a few times.."
694637,mike rousseau,2012-05-09 19:33:00,4661,thats dumb...  ive driven a boat my whole life and i need a license...  but joe blow can go rent a speed boat that goes 50+mph and doesnt need one...  :wallbash:
694651,DRIFTER_016,2012-05-09 20:13:00,10439,  Yep!! Don't want to lose any tourist $$$.
694653,lew,2012-05-09 20:18:00,12766, I drove trucks with air brakes for 25 years then the government decided I needed to be tested and licensed to do it.  Alot of stuff our governments get involved in doesn't make much sense
694660,Fisherman,2012-05-09 20:38:00,7201," Ha, well what's the difference between this and a driver that can't follow simple rules like, not on the phone while driving."
694665,adempsey,2012-05-09 20:51:00,1498,"Well, you're supposed to go through a checklist for a rental boat and that's the equivalent of the operators card.  So, technically you do need one still.  At least, that's how I understand the regs.  Maybe I missed something?"
694667,misfish,2012-05-09 20:52:00,29133,  Heres your wooden spoon.
694694,vance,2012-05-09 23:19:00,719,Technically you are suppose to carry the rental agreement with you which is your proof of a temporary boaters license BUT even last year when the OPP stopped me they didn't ask for my license  vance
694701,Muskieman,2012-05-09 23:49:00,2472,Were you in a rental Vance ?  There are a few exemptions for persons over the age of 16 .... # 1 using a boat while working ( technically GUIDES are exempt) is how I understand it . ( is it just me ?)  # 2 renting a boat ( checklist required)  #3 non resident under 45 days . http://www.boaterexam.com/canada/faq_rules-en.aspx  Randy 
694713,jerdog,2012-05-10 00:10:00,39,"""There are a few exemptions for persons over the age of 16 .... # 1 using a boat while working ( technically GUIDES are exempt) is how I understand it . ( is it just me ?)""  not exempt - need a different license.  A 'working boat' is no longer a pleasure craft, it's a commercial vessel which requires (at least?) a MED A3.  Transport Canada web page has lots of details."
694718,Muskieman,2012-05-10 00:17:00,2472,"Straight from the page.  Q. I operate a boat for work purposes. Do I need the Card? A. No. A Pleasure Craft Operator Card is only required by operators of watercraft being used for recreational purposes. It is common however for many commercial establishments (such as marinas, and fishing & hunting lodges)to ask their staff to obtain their Pleasure Craft Operator Card.  Nothing mentioned about a different lisense required ?   Must be on the employers side of things .... Maybe the guide himself ?"
694720,Christopheraaron,2012-05-10 00:30:00,3525,You have to watch though because some rental companies don't offer the checklist.
694732,jerdog,2012-05-10 01:16:00,39,"From TC page Chartered Vessel If you rent or charter a vessel, it is a commercial vessel if: the master is the owner or someone provided by the owner; or it is used other than for pleasure. If you rent or charter a vessel without crew and you either hire a master or operate it yourself, it is a pleasure craft so long as it is used only for your pleasure, hunting or fishing for your own food, or for other needs of your daily living. If you are the owner, and you rent or charter the vessel without crew to someone else who uses it for pleasure, it is a pleasure craft. If you provide the master, or operate the vessel yourself, it is a commercial vessel.(bold emphasis added by me)  where: ""Commercial vessel"" – a vessel that is not a pleasure craft or used for commercial fishing. The Small Vessel Regulations do not define ""commercial"" but refer instead to ""vessels other than a pleasure craft."" Both ""commercial vessel"" and ""non-pleasure vessel"" are used in this guide to mean ""vessel other than a pleasure craft."" Vessels of all types, including human-powered vessels and vessels that are owned by any level of government and government entities like fire and police departments, are commercial vessels unless used only for pleasure."
694737,jerdog,2012-05-10 01:28:00,39,"Which is to say - in order to operate a commercial vessel you need a different license and that license is deemed appropriate in place of a PCOC. If you have a MED A3, you don't need a PCOC."
694824,Woodsman,2012-05-10 12:15:00,1286,"Also misleading. Only applies if they are operating their own boat registered in their home country. No good for a boat they own which is registered in Canada, or a boat owned by someone else (ie: father or other family member or friend)"
694829,Billy Bob,2012-05-10 12:23:00,5865,I don't need one as I leave Canada after 44.5 days then turn around and re-enter...LOL
694830,Fisherman,2012-05-10 12:29:00,7201," Hmm, just like a bad nightmare...  :rofl2:"
694838,Billy Bob,2012-05-10 13:10:00,5865, It sounds like you need to catch a fish....
694854,Woodsman,2012-05-10 14:00:00,1286,The 45 days doesn't apply to the operator but the boat. Unless the boat leaves Canada for a full calender day the clock doesn't start over.
695316,Rice Laker,2012-05-11 18:06:00,24,"I rent boats and go through the 15 point check list with those who do not have a Boat Operator’s Card.  From my experiences, I would much rather be in a boat with someone who went through the checklist that morning than someone who got the Card 5 years ago on the Internet and has never been in a boat in their life......  Also in response to earlier postings, I don't know anyone who rents boats that ""go 50mph""."
