694787,Nipfisher,2012-05-10 04:23:00,2449,I am sure some of you know what these are? I have no clue. I guess they are for trolling? No markings on any of them.            
694788,dave524,2012-05-10 04:26:00,4508,The first ones are Ping a T's and the last ones are Luhr Jensen Fireplugs.
694790,Spiel,2012-05-10 08:26:00,9065, Exactly!
694811,asdve23rveavwa,2012-05-10 11:40:00,2690,"Yupper, Dave has it bang on.  Great for chucking off piers for salmon, back in the day."
694815,Nipfisher,2012-05-10 11:51:00,2449,Thanks guys. They were in a tackle box I was given. No Salmon here in North Bay  .
694816,asdve23rveavwa,2012-05-10 11:53:00,2690," Shouldn't have a problem selling them, Blair."
694819,Nipfisher,2012-05-10 12:02:00,2449," I used to take a Salmon trip to Manitoulin Island each fall but stopped a few years back. I have 4-5 J-plugs and other plugs (one says ""made by Gold star and the other says Silver Harde) that I will be puting up for sale."
694821,dave524,2012-05-10 12:07:00,4508," Actually the Ping a T's go for a pretty good price, there are a few diehards that like them. I have a couple, they are with my steelhead gear, the skunk coloured one was supposed to be hot in the rivers fished like you would a Flatfish or Quickfish. The Fireplugs were a spring salmon fishing staple, back in the early Coho days. Remember fishing in the early 70's with Dad, launch at Foran's here in Grimsby and troll 15 feet of water with them just east of the rifle range, catch a mess of small coho and football browns. Still got a bunch in 2 sizes in red, chartreuse and chrome, the chrome ones were successful behind a set of cowbells for Lakers in Haliburton, when you ran out of good sized chubs to rig up with a baiting needle."
694894,adempsey,2012-05-10 16:16:00,1498,We used to use Fireplugs for bass fishing all the time when I was a kid.   They were our go to lure and they worked great.   Would buy some if I could find them.
694947,mike rousseau,2012-05-10 17:40:00,4661,i thought it was a mercury minnow for a minute.... they had mercury in them instead of steel balls... my dad actually has one of these...  
694972,Nipfisher,2012-05-10 19:10:00,2449,  I was using my crappy cell phone camera. I was too lazy/tired to walk the 15 steps it would have taken to get my digi cam.
694975,misfish,2012-05-10 19:13:00,29133,Wheres a pic of those other items? Quil floats
695127,Nipfisher,2012-05-11 02:08:00,2449,  I'll get them on here after the weekend.
695200,craigdritchie,2012-05-11 13:13:00,1586,Larger Ping a T's are pretty good lures for pike. They stand up to a lot of chewing.
