Two days on two special lakes, with specks on our minds. Over the years these spots have been great and hair pulling at times. lol.  I went 8/9, averaging 14-15"" but landed two over 17""   http://img51.imageshack.us/slideshow/webplayer.php?id=img1516fh.jpg  Enjoy! I know I did"

693819,mirogak,2012-05-07 15:09:00,387,"  So you went just this past weekend?  How was the bug activity?  My trip on the opening day wasn't that great, I am thinking of hitting again either this weekend or the following."
693824,Rod Caster,2012-05-07 15:20:00,5784,"That one speckie is a beauty  I was in the park trolling for lakers this sunday...got 4, nothing huge, but pretty good for a 4 hour day trip."
694443,GreenCanada,2012-05-09 01:53:00,375," Surprisingly, the bugs were not bad at all. 0-5 degree mornings helped with that, though, the blackflies started to emerge by Sunday afternoon. Not many biters, but maybe they are waiting for someone a bit sweeter!"
694447,GreenCanada,2012-05-09 02:00:00,375," The one with the tape measure was 17"", a beauty for sure! I have a lot more photos of this past weekend, but unfortunately I can't post them because it would give too much information away and risk ruining these two pristine sources of specks!"
