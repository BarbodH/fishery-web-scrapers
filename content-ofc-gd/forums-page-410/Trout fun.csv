693970,Christopheraaron,2012-05-07 20:57:00,3525,"Amazing, looks like the trout fishing is good this year!"
693978,highdrifter,2012-05-07 21:16:00,2534,Awesome!  Therapy indeed.  The trib I hit today was high and cloudy..  shoulda threw some spinnners!  Atta boy.  cheers HD
693979,spincast,2012-05-07 21:18:00,3279,Stunning photos.
694047,MJL,2012-05-08 00:51:00,2427,"Thanks guys. Glad you liked the pics   Cliff I did have a career in photography...I took pictures of models...You know...Whirlpool & Maytag washers and dryers   I did catch the fish that violated you...He was 26 inches long but terribly unphotogenic. I opted not to take pics of him   Jon, for the underwater shots, I used my Canon 40D with an 11-16mm lens. I have the setup inside an underwater housing. It's definitely not easy to use (especially shooting with 1 hand while fighting a fish with the other but at 1/3 the cost of the next cheapest professional housing, I can't complain. Pain in the ass when you have to bushwhack though. The above water shot of the brown was taken with a Canon T3i.  Some of the shots of the brookies were taken during a thunderstorm on Wednesday evening. 5 minutes later, the river was a silty grey and mostly un-fishable.  "

694056,BillM,2012-05-08 01:12:00,17367,"Mike, I love that EWA Marine housing, I'm so close to pulling the trigger on one!   Great pics man!"
694092,tb4me,2012-05-08 02:01:00,3295,Those are some of the best underwater pics I have seen..thanks for that!
694098,danc,2012-05-08 02:09:00,4677,Fantastic Mike. I appreciate the hard work that you put into these shots.
694143,Jet,2012-05-08 08:51:00,364,Mike you should come follow me around for a week this fall!  Killer stuff bud! Love it and miss it.
694144,limeyangler,2012-05-08 09:14:00,5204,So i'm scrolling through thinking...wow...these are cool. and i get to one that is just even more wow....i had to scroll back and count the pics one by one just so i could let you know i think picture #19 is the best!  Thanks for sharing Mike.
694154,Trevor0179,2012-05-08 10:27:00,65,Absolutely remarkable pictures good job man
694173,Guidofisherman,2012-05-08 11:53:00,206,"Very impressive!!! You sure put in the hours and got amazing shots. I know it is not easy to take the underwater shots. I like your DSLR set-up, but a little worrying putting an expensive camera like that underwater. It is a pain to carry, yet the clarity is well worth it. Very nice job and I look forward to more. Alan"
694183,lovetofish,2012-05-08 12:25:00,500,Wow! Great pictures and beautiful fish!
694229,wallacio,2012-05-08 14:30:00,475,Amazing Mike...some great fish and pictures.   Thanks for taking the time and effort with these captures!
694233,fishing n autograph,2012-05-08 14:50:00,2540,Those are some awesome pics! Nice fish too!
694253,Spiel,2012-05-08 15:37:00,9065,"Absolutely outstanding photography Mike, I can't even begin to imagine the stealth needed to sneak up on them feeding Browns."
694286,Mike Pike,2012-05-08 17:13:00,1332,"Wow, I don't know what to say that hasn't already been said.  Just amazing photos, Mike!  And that wasn't only therapy for you."
694296,SirCranksalot,2012-05-08 17:43:00,3291, ditto!!
694413,MJL,2012-05-09 00:43:00,2427,Thanks again guys   I hope bull trout are easier to catch than lake trout   Those shots of the fish feeding mostly involved me sitting in the stream with my finger on the shutter button for 45 minutes (after 45 minutes they came back out to feed). I guess they used me as a current break afterwards. Water was pretty damn cold though - I forgot the camera remote at home.LOL
694415,Joeytier,2012-05-09 00:48:00,3990,"Good goin', Mike.  I've had far more luck so far with subsurface flies this season, but when the water rises I definitely turn to the spinners.  I've done well with the speckles, but I haven't quite dialed in the brownies yet...WOW"
694480,corvette1,2012-05-09 08:13:00,1765,awesome shots congrats
694755,livinisfishin,2012-05-10 02:16:00,661,45 minutes in the water....thats dedication Mike!Nice work!
693776,MJL,2012-05-07 13:08:00,2427,"Since trout opener, I’ve made a few forays to the streams in search of brookies & resident browns. By far they are the prettiest fish we have in Ontario and definitely some of my favourite fish to catch. It’s certainly a change from steelheading though. Pin-point accurate casting, hero drifts underneath log jams and ghost-like stealth are required. Study to be silent and disappear. With gin clear water and high sun, it was a challenge. Aside from my fishing gear, I also brought along my camera gear in the hopes of taking some nifty shots.  Brookies            Browns  Yesterday I hit 7 different streams over the course of 14hrs for wild browns. In 2 of the streams the browns were just insanely coloured up. Vibrant yellows, reds and many with big leopard spots. They fought with reckless abandon and many tail-walked and jumped like a steelhead. Lost 1 biggun around 6-7lbs to the wood  Smashed a panther Martin             Camouflage     21 inch warrior that lost a bit of its tail   I also managed to sneak up to 1 shallow riffle and take a few shots of browns holding in the current and feeding.           Yesterday I also discovered 1 stream just loaded with brookies. Ironically it was some of the toughest fishing I’ve ever experienced for them. They were just too smart.  I did land a small handful though on extremely tiny nymphs my friend tied up for me (I borrowed his 0wt fly rod for the day which made even tiny fish feel big.LOL)   I felt like a kid again exploring new waters and hunting down fish yesterday. The blood sucking bugs were also totally absent which made the trip even more awesome. I walked the distances through thick forests and muddy bogs to find some amazing spots – It was therapy for the soul."
693782,woodenboater,2012-05-07 13:23:00,2277,"Great sub surface photos ! and the colouring on those trout, gorgeous. Thx for the pix, and report"
693784,Roy,2012-05-07 13:27:00,13728,Wow! Those pics are just super and so clear! Thanks so much for posting them Mike.
693785,Victor,2012-05-07 13:28:00,1609,"Can't believe you put in another full day yesterday haha, and you were rewarded! I was exhausted after Saturday.  Awesome pics! Don't worry I'll catch that 6-7lb brown that you lost next week."
693786,torco,2012-05-07 13:29:00,656,"Wow great report, 14hrs and 7 streams that is just incredible. My brother inlaw did the samething yesterday minus the beautiful pictures. I used my fly rod and he used his ultralight, we hiked a gorgeous stretch of river for about 5hrs and caught some nice fish. The ultra light with spinner outfished me because he could get his spinners into all these little pockets. I had been wishing I packed the ultralight along as well. It was just the perfect day for it."
693788,johnnyb,2012-05-07 13:42:00,3413,Fantastic shots....thanks for putting that up

693818,frozen-fire,2012-05-07 15:09:00,542," Now you know how I feel.  While going through your pics, I was looking out for the big buck brown that violated me last year. Soooo glad you didn't get him Did you try for him in that wood?!  Fantastic photos. The fact that you're out there by yourself taking these shots is awesome. One of these days we'll get some half and half shots with the angler in the background"
693821,mirogak,2012-05-07 15:16:00,387,Very nice.  I was out doing the same thing yesterday with my GoPro but the water was too murky.  Awesome photos.

693861,Jon,2012-05-07 16:54:00,209,"Incredible shots! Given the rain we had last Thursday, I'm surprised you were able to find water that clear. I'm shopping around for an underwater camera and was wondering what you are using.  Thanks in advance,  Jon"
693878,Sharkbait22,2012-05-07 17:28:00,297,Great shots! What kind of gear are you using? Technique?
