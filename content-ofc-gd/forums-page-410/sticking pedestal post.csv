694700,mike rousseau,2012-05-09 23:48:00,4661,well i have pedestal bases like these...    and i find the pedestals get stuck in every time... no matter how long theyre in for... 1 trip or 20...  last time i had to remove the base from the boat and use a hammer to get the pedestal out...  i like removing the seats im not using to free up floor space...  anybody have some tricks to get them out... and any tricks to prevent em from getting stuck in the first place... im thinking a big wad of grease... but that seems like the most sloppy fix...  also dads  ranger has the same issues but different pedestals and bases...  thanks  mike
694703,scugpg,2012-05-09 23:52:00,1373,Make sure there isn't any sand or corrosion in there and clean both the post and base. Chances are dirt is getting caught and making it tough to get out.
694704,John Bacon,2012-05-09 23:56:00,3277,I had the same bases and similar issue with my old boat. Try hitting the post on the side a couple times before trying to remove it.
694706,mercman,2012-05-10 00:00:00,7054,"Take an electric drill and a brass wire brush bit, and clean out the post hole. The brass brush should remove any burrs on the aluminum housing."
694708,Jer,2012-05-10 00:04:00,1426,  This usually works for me...
694715,Muskieman,2012-05-10 00:12:00,2472,"I have the same ones ....I used SEAFOAM on a rag an cleaned it out worked wonders .... but unlike the wonders it does to engines and fuel systems it didn't last .... WD-40 works well too ....  The other posts are right , even dust will make 'er stick ....  Very problematic , bad design I guess.  Randy "
694721,Roy,2012-05-10 00:34:00,13728,Never had a problem with mine. I have the same taper locks. Keep them reasonably clean (as in once a year) and add a small dab of grease or even vaseline on the spring lock. You'll never have a problem.
694739,NANUK,2012-05-10 01:33:00,797,"Clean the aluminum base with a wire brush or fine sandpaper, just don't over do it or it will be too loose, Use a non pertrolium base lubricant if you really have to like bees wax or graphite. Using a pertrolium base product like WD40 or grease may cause the plastic seat post to swell over time and make the problem worst."
694741,Tybo,2012-05-10 01:43:00,1373,Any type of lubricant will attract more dirt.
694749,mike rousseau,2012-05-10 02:03:00,4661, good point...  so i guess once i get the stuck post out ill give the post and base a good cleaning and see how that goes...
694751,whiskywizard,2012-05-10 02:06:00,305,I use SailKote dry lubricant. It doesn't attract any dirt. Needs to be applied once at spring launch and again about once more during the season.
694764,fish_fishburn,2012-05-10 02:43:00,1311,I have the same posts on my boat. A bit of sandpaper in the hole then wipe it out with a clean rag and your good to go. No need to use any lube as it just collects crud and makes things worse.
694769,Roy,2012-05-10 02:52:00,13728,"Yeah, ok, don't use anything. Just clean it."
694810,BITEME,2012-05-10 11:34:00,1968,scotchbrite and dishsoap.... rinse

694825,Billy Bob,2012-05-10 12:16:00,5865,I have the exact bases on my boat but I have never had a problem with them....my post has a plastic insert on it though....I just hate how you have to push you foot against the locking clip before you pull up on them.  Mike does your post have a plastic insert on the post like this ? ? ?  http://www.cabelas.com/product/Swivl-Eze174-Wedge8482-Power-Pedestal/738008.uts?Ntk=AllProducts&searchPath=%2Fcatalog%2Fsearch.cmd%3Fform_state%3DsearchForm%26N%3D0%26fsch%3Dtrue%26Ntk%3DAllProducts%26Ntt%3Dseat%2Bpedestals%26x%3D0%26y%3D0%26WTz_l%3DHeader%253BSearch-All%2BProducts&Ntt=seat+pedestals&WTz_l=Header%3BSearch-All+Products
694879,mike rousseau,2012-05-10 15:39:00,4661, Yup
694943,davey buoy,2012-05-10 17:27:00,5505," Yes, but not on the seat. you'll be in the drink before you know it.Lol."
694969,Fish4Eyes,2012-05-10 18:53:00,1022,"I have the same ones and do notice they stick from time to time. I noticed they stick when someone real heavy sits on the seats. Eventually I get enraged enough to rip them out. As mentioned above, hitting the side of the post does help a bit."
695007,smally21,2012-05-10 20:10:00,993,"same post, same problem. in a single use i find it gets right stuck. there are a few ideas here i haven't tried.  but i share your pain. you're not imagining things..."
695106,Kerry,2012-05-11 01:20:00,383,How about a small thin washer laid in the bottom.If it's thin enough you get the lock to catch but maybe enough thickness to stop the taper from jamming. Kerry
695110,danc,2012-05-11 01:24:00,4677,"I've had the same problem with Springfield seat mounts for decades. A good stiff whack on the post, with the chair removed, always solves the problem."
695117,Pigeontroller,2012-05-11 01:43:00,2793,Getting rid of a 350 lb. fishing pardner worked for me...
695124,Fisherpete,2012-05-11 01:57:00,1814,Think coat of muskie slime should do the trick!
