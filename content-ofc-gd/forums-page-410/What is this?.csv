As they both drain out the same hole in the transom I figgured the line was blocked. I tried to feed a wire through and it made some improvement but was still slow. Yesterday while preping the boat I removed the hose clamp and checked the hose. This is what I found    It is a waxy-like substance. It was about 3"" long and prettty much filed the hose.   Any idea what would cause this? It broke apart as I dug it out of the hose with a screwdriver. Here are 2 more pictures (taken with cell phone).     It was not slipperly like soap and of course it smelled like fish."

694204,krixxer,2012-05-08 13:32:00,274,fish ear wax build up; should taste ok with a little dill     serious.... could it be decomposed minnows that got sucked in last year?
694207,Nipfisher,2012-05-08 13:34:00,2449,It is the consistancy of candle wax. Don't think it is decomposed minnows.  The dog wouldn't eat it so it can't taste good at all.
694211,HTHM,2012-05-08 13:38:00,4082,The technical term for that substance is GUNK. Keep cleaning out your hoses and it will be fine.
694261,Nipfisher,2012-05-08 15:56:00,2449,  That is pretty scientific.
694263,Rod Caster,2012-05-08 16:04:00,5784,"Hate to see what your ears looks like ... Maybe its an actual metled candle. Someone could have put it in there, it melted in the hot sun and made its way down the drain?"
