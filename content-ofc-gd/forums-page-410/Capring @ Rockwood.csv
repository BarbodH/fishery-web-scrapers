695060,Christopheraaron,2012-05-10 23:56:00,3525,"I was there last year and next to algonquin probably the nicest waterbody that i visited, not sure how the camping is, but personally I would go through the week so that it's calmer, also I would target rainbow trout, yes they are stocked however they are more plentiful and of good size. I want to get out on the long weekend with the canoe in a couple weeks."
695061,Joeytier,2012-05-11 00:04:00,3990,Different Rockwood...
695062,Christopheraaron,2012-05-11 00:09:00,3525,"Oh, where is this one?"
695102,crossover,2012-05-11 01:14:00,172,"Lol, I'm talking about Rockwood Conservation Area, and Richmond's description fits it pretty well. This is a mother's day picnic thing so I won't really have time to be canoeing (maybe for a future excursion)."
695178,Christopheraaron,2012-05-11 12:13:00,3525,"Ya, ok, that makes more sense, if you are just there for a mother's day thing you could probably find some time, sneak off to the eastern side by the mill really nice place, sorry still nothing on carp."
695281,pylon,2012-05-11 16:36:00,68,Some big carp at rockwood. Loads of sunfish. Canoe or kayak only. No power motors and a nice place to  camp too
