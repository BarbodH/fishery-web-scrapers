694895,mirogak,2012-05-10 16:19:00,387," I think it was a combination of both.  I remember thinking there is NO way that little nymph is hitting the bottom with that stronger upper current.  So what do you guys do in situations like these, do you ""high stick"" it, like hold your rod high and not letting the main line float like that?  And in order to hit bottom do you add little tiny splitshots to your leader?  But wouldn't that mess up your presentation?"
694921,cuzza,2012-05-10 17:02:00,467,"Weighted flies with either a lead underbody or a beadhead or both! I tie my own and use a tungsten bead with a few wraps of lead if I can get away with it - great for deep pockets behind a boulder. You can help your fly sink quicker by mending the line, which slows the drift and lets it sink. I'm not a fan of split shot but they do work - if you use them position it about 8-12 inches above the fly.  Don't get too hung up on fly selection and match the hatch, a generic bug pattern like a Pheasant Tail Nymph or Hares Ear will catch fish if you fish it correctly."
694948,mirogak,2012-05-10 17:44:00,387,Cool
694540,mirogak,2012-05-09 13:51:00,387,"Just thought I upload this video of me hitting the Credit river this past weekend.  Sun was bright, water was high and fast ... didn't get a bite but neither did the other fly fishermen I saw that day.  Still fun though.  <iframe width=""640"" height=""360"" src=""http://www.youtube.com/embed/aQZa5OR8p-0"" frameborder=""0"" allowfullscreen></iframe>"
694545,lew,2012-05-09 14:14:00,12766,"That was a great video, thanks for putting it up !!  I actually felt like I was the one doing the casting"
694546,chuckymcd,2012-05-09 14:22:00,144,"good stuff, I dont know how many times ive hooked a tree fly fishing, its a pain sometimes!!"
694547,mirogak,2012-05-09 14:22:00,387, Hahah yes - that is because the camera was mounted on my head  almost at the eye level
694554,Musky or Specks,2012-05-09 14:51:00,2710,"Miro that water is definitely high and dirty but not unfishable. A bright coloured muddler might have moved some fish, wish I could have made it."
694556,BillM,2012-05-09 15:04:00,17367,"If you're just starting out, you definitely want to fish in the evening after preferably a warm sunny day..  You'll get to the river and see all kinds of bugs coming off (and hopefully fish slurping them up!)  Match the hatch (size is more important then exact colour) and give it a shot.  Fishing in the afternoon when the sun is high with zero cloud cover isn't easy at all."
694558,solopaddler,2012-05-09 15:11:00,8605,For your very first attempt your casting skills aren't half bad Miro. Great video!
694560,mirogak,2012-05-09 15:16:00,387," Thx for the tips.  Yes, wasn't easy at all.  I felt like they were watching me the whole time tucked under the banks with a smurk on their face .... hahaha"
694561,mirogak,2012-05-09 15:17:00,387, Thank you Mike.  I have been practicing over the fall and winter months in the creek behind my house.
694563,mirogak,2012-05-09 15:21:00,387, Next time Brad.  Thx for the tip.
694580,SirCranksalot,2012-05-09 16:28:00,3291,"Miro,  This club in  Scarboro http://www.pathcom.com/~coachman/ used to teach casting and  maybe still does. I don't know if Gord Deval is still active(Google him to see links to his books), but he was the instructor and a champion fly caster. They used a school gym in winter but had some activity in the summer. (I got to go to a couple of secret fishing spots with Gord & co. They used code names when referring to 2 of those lakes!)"
694611,mirogak,2012-05-09 17:50:00,387,"Irony is that I met these guys at this year's Toronto Sportsman Show.  I was curios to join them, I have their card with me.  These guys meet every Tuesday - they even teach you how to build fly rods.  And yes Gord is still active according to the guy I was talking to at the booth.  Now that you mentioned this group and given his track record, I think I will pay them a visit for sure.  Thanks!"
694646,torco,2012-05-09 20:01:00,656,Your casting looks pretty good for a new fly fisherman. Hell I don't think mine is any better and I have been doing it for a couple of seasons.  What were you using? I had success on the credit this past weekend swinging small BWO wet flies.
694652,misfish,2012-05-09 20:15:00,29133,Thanks for the video Miro. I will be trying my hand at this art very soon.  Thanks for taking the time to post it.
694656,esoxansteel,2012-05-09 20:28:00,1307,"The video and music choice was excellent, pease and tranquility, which is what i look for when fly fishing, and exactly what i felt watching your video, could have watched that for an hour  "
694661,ChrisK,2012-05-09 20:40:00,2772,That was a great video. Fly fishing is quite an art and like anything else it just takes a little practice before you find your nitch... Keep it up !
694669,mirogak,2012-05-09 21:05:00,387," Thanks - I was using BWO nymphs and emergers, also tried dries.  Did you fish Saturday?"
694671,mirogak,2012-05-09 21:11:00,387," Glad you liked it.  I have got a ""river mission"" this summer, so stay tuned for more of these, hopefully with fish on the other end of the line."
694773,BillM,2012-05-10 03:06:00,17367,"Miro, just another heads up if you're planning a lot of resident fishing this summer.  Bring a cheap thermometer with you to the river, if the temp is close to 70 degrees or over, the survival rate of any catch and released fish really goes down..  I usually stop fishing if the temps are that high.."
694803,mirogak,2012-05-10 11:08:00,387, Aah I see. But is that any fish or the cold water brookies and browns? And I was planning to hit the headwaters where the temps should be cooler. Can the head waters get that warm too? Miro
694823,BillM,2012-05-10 12:12:00,17367,"It really depends on the type of summer we have.. If it's super hot with a little rain, even the headwaters of some systems will get that hot..  Just something to be aware of  A cheap pool thermometer works just fine.   Lots of fly guys you'll see will have them on their vests."
694833,mirogak,2012-05-10 12:40:00,387, Cool ... I'll source one too then.  Thx.
694837,torco,2012-05-10 13:10:00,656,"Hey Miro, I was out Sunday, I didn't see much rising so I never touched the dries. I am surprised you got nothing on nymphs or emerges.  I found most fish hit at the end of the swing. Next time try the classic wet fly swing, its dead simple and it works. If you were fishing nymphs, often times when you are not getting any takes its likely one of two problems.  The first is that the fly is not getting down to the bottom, you should be ticking bottom every few casts. You may just need more.  The second can be drag so the fly does not appear to be drifting naturally under the water. If you are using an indicator a good measure is to make sure your indicator is drifting at the same rate as the bubbles on the water.  Bill I like the idea of thermometer and a very good point for our cold water fish."
694844,cuzza,2012-05-10 13:38:00,467,"Good point on the temps from Bill - last year the Upper Credit was over 70 by mid June, no biggie, that just means it's time to change over to bass which are great fun on the fly!  Get some of the smallest  Nice vid by the way - you look the part creeping through the bushes at the start!"
694893,mirogak,2012-05-10 16:16:00,387, Yes - the indicator is on my shopping list. And thx for the comment
