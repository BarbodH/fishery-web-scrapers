694555,Nipfisher,2012-05-09 15:03:00,2449,I looked at the Mustang and Onyx ones at Canadian Tire yesterday. The manual ones from Mustang were $179 and the automatic ones were $199. Onyx had a manual one for $139.  Anyone know of any deals? I am limited to on-line shopping from North Bay as we don't have many/any big box places.

694612,Nipfisher,2012-05-09 18:00:00,2449,  Ya I checked eBay and some other on-line sites. With shipping and broker fees it will cost the same. I may be best to buy locally at Can Tire or North Bay Outfitters or Lefebvre's Souurce for Sports. That way if I have issues it is easier to bring back.
694614,camillj,2012-05-09 18:06:00,1988,Thanks for reminding me !!!! Almost forgot to pack mine for my upcoming Speck trip into the ZEC au Quebec !  The Mrs got me a mustang MD3153 ... cant remember the price ... but I do remember doing all the research and figuring it was the best bang for the buck (at Le B back around Christmas time at least).
694620,lew,2012-05-09 18:35:00,12766," My wife  got me the same one for Christmas Jon, also from LeB's, and like you I did alot of researching and it seems to be one of the best around right now."
694649,ah_long,2012-05-09 20:06:00,354,Go for the mustang but make sure you get the deluxe version with the neoprene collar. I got the hydrostatic one from LB.  The hydrostatic one will not blow up in heavy rain. The refills do cost more for the hydrostatic but they do last longer.
694650,ah_long,2012-05-09 20:08:00,354,"Btw. SAIL has the deluxe for $159, remember to check if they are still doing the no tax sale"

694781,Nipfisher,2012-05-10 04:00:00,2449,  Is that mainly for comfort?
694789,ah_long,2012-05-10 04:34:00,354," Yes. Without it, it will be really irritating on those hot days"
