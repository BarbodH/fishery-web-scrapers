694566,myot,2012-05-09 15:32:00,131,Top of the line downriggers are probably the new traxtech but they run about $1800 Canadaian each I have run downriggers from all the major manufactures and they all work well and all have thier glitches  Big Jon best pullies on the market Brute ES are fantastic specialy when you put on the variable speed Crap counters and week booms  Scotty Best customer sevice around great motors and design New 2116 are awsome Look like Brigs and Srtaton lawn mowers  Cannon Best auto stop on the market buy far the best fit and finish jumpy take some time to get used to making small depth adjustments  Walkers JUNK  these are just my opinions I curently run Scotty's and love them  Dan
694570,John,2012-05-09 15:45:00,2956,"I am biased as Cannon, Humminbird, Minnkota companies are clients of mine.  My choice based on service, price and overall usability would be Scotty though.......don't tell anyone."
694573,tonyb,2012-05-09 15:59:00,1637,"I have a pair of older Cannon Mag 15's and I love the auto-stop which works on conductivity, thus stopping the weight at the waterline.  I have a pair of brand new walker tournament electrics sitting on a shelf, I haven't tried them yet as I don't think they are capable of lifting a 15lb weight? anyone know for sure?  Also, not sure about the auto-stop, if any, on the Walkers...?  Best parts availability goes to Walker or Scotty I'd say, have heard some stories of difficult parts replacement for Cannon or Big Jon.  At the end of the day, they will all do the job, find a pair that fits your budget, nothing wrong with used either  Tony"
694576,Pikeslayer,2012-05-09 16:07:00,1443, Running a pair from 1991.
694577,alexmedic,2012-05-09 16:17:00,186,"I learned to down rig on Scotty's.  A few years later I bought a used set of Big Jons for a great price.  2 years later, I sold the Big Jons.  I wished I just waited and bought Scottys."
694584,dave524,2012-05-09 16:33:00,4508,"I've got a pair of Big Jon electrics that date back to 82, they have the old solid, 1 piece, stainless , tip up booms. I really like the tip up for getting a hold of the ball and release. Not so crazy about the new multi sectional booms. With a punch for removing roll pins, allen wrench and a screw driver you can replace any part on them. Maybe I like that they look like a machinist made them rather than a plastic mould machine."
694585,Steve,2012-05-09 16:41:00,2075,"Dave, yours sound like mine, except mine (big jon as well) date back to 1976.  the original motors failed this year. 36 years of use!"
694586,Fisherman,2012-05-09 16:41:00,7201,"Scotty, made here, serviced here, and you're supporting Canadian."
694608,fishindevil,2012-05-09 17:33:00,6254,"i have a pair of big jon tip up elctric riggers from the early 90's and they are awesome ye4s had to replace the counters and a spring once but other than that they will never rust,and they have about a million hrs on them and work flawless,they all will work size and space in your boat might be an issuse as some brands of riggers are alot bigger and if you need space to mount them that could be a something to think about !!!"
694775,fishdawg,2012-05-10 03:15:00,912,"everyone likes different riggers for different reasons some suit a certain boat's layout or an anglers fishing style (ie. some guys fish very deep with heavier balls, like 15lbs or more..)  ive used them all, and my boat has Scotty Pro Packs 116's, a little bulky yes, but very fast durable and fucntional  mind you though, if you know that you never plan to fish deeper then 50 feet down, then go manuals all the way! (walker or cannon make the best manuals) Much less to worry about with manuals."
694805,Randy,2012-05-10 11:24:00,115,"Scottys, been running them for over 10 years. The only problem I had was that the knob used to lock the boom extension in-place broke off. Called Scotty and they sent me a free replacement part. They also walked me through the steps on how to install the replacement part."
694806,BITEME,2012-05-10 11:27:00,1968,Scotty why bother with anything else!!!!!  Biteme
694831,Fish Farmer,2012-05-10 12:30:00,2234,"Metal or plastic, that's why I have Big Jon's"
694875,Steve,2012-05-10 15:11:00,2075,Big Jons are as much art as they are machinery.  Even 35 years later ....  No plastic or composite components found on these babies!!!
694877,DRIFTER_016,2012-05-10 15:16:00,10439,"I used Walkers, Canons and Big Jons when I was chartering on Lake Ontario and all are capable but my favorites for ease of use and simplicity were the Big Jon Captains Pak riggers on my buddies boat."
694878,NANUK,2012-05-10 15:28:00,797,"I have used Scotty, Canon and Big Jon, I like the built quality of Big Jon and functionality of Canons Currently running Canons and very happy with them."
