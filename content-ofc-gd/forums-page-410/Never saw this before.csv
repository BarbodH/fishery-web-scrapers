694967,NAW,2012-05-10 18:36:00,4022,"It was a video of a homeless guy being beated to death by some cops in California.  Not suited for OFC.  I understand the intent of the post, but the content of the video was over the top for a site like OFC.  You didn't miss anything Lew.  But if you have an itching to find out more.  The guys name was Kelly Thomas.  The cops are being charged, one with murder."
