I've only done fly in's with my dad, back in the day, and we only used 2pc rods back then.  Now I prefer 1piece. The planes I've been on were smaller float planes, and I didn't have lots of room for 1piece rods in them.  Do the bigger planes have the room, or do they put rod tubes on the pontoons?  Just thinking of a new rod, and it will hopefully be taken on a trophy pike fly in with the next few years!  Thanks!"
