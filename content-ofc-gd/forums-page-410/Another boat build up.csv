I got this for 1400 two seasons ago. My friends dad had a co-worker with a boat in the yard... I'll ask for you.....so I buy the boat sight unseen.  I ended up with one hell of a project. All the wood had to go, all the paint had to go... you name it I replaced it. I regret not having the initial pictures but it's all for the best, I'd rather forget what it took to get her to this point.    "

694231,ccmtcanada,2012-05-08 14:35:00,7971,Looks great krixxer!  Your job sounded a lot more involved than mine was.  Must feel good to take it out on the water knowing you've put all that work in to it
694328,doubleheader,2012-05-08 19:07:00,497,Man you should be proud of that. I hope the old girl appreciates what you did for her and gives you many years of service. Very nice job.

The floors  As an alternative to carpet I used a polyurethane paint with 20% Teflon additive. It feels like a pan, easy to clean but dangerously slippery when wet so in the last coat I added some Griptex. "

Available in rolls of black or white. Located in the store next to the display of tubes of silicone and other sealers.  Have used it on both boat and pontoon boat and has lasted many seasons without lifting."
