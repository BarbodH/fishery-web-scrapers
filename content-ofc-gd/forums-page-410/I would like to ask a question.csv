694624,fishing,2012-05-09 18:59:00,167,"Unfortunately my experiences seem to be exactly opposite to what you had, sir. I fish all over the place, and fish as much as 14 times a week, 14 hours a day. And also have been fished for decades. Do I need to understand it? No. Just accept facts. Some people think that they are entitled to do what they want to do, that's it."
694627,Fishing yoda,2012-05-09 19:13:00,29," I would have to agree with you sir, If they are indeed breakign the law by poaching and keeping illegal slot size fish, report them! its as simple as that!! call in the heavys and let them take care of it, need we remind anybody of the gentlman that is banned from fishing for life for having multiple offences doing the same things these guys are doing. Let the MNR do it's job i know its a thing if you call them but remember if he is there today catching everything you can almost be certain he'll be back doing the same thing tomorrow... more than likely anyways, unitl they start getting charged and hauled away nothing will change!   it's sad really"

Buy a license and follow the rules we ALL have the right to enjoy what mother nature has provided for us in moderation of course... I personally have never had to deal with anything like that.. I cannot comprehend the emotions you must be goign through.. personally don't know how i would react if someone casted their line on top of mine while i was attempting to land a fish( mind you i always carry nippers in my pocket when fishing so i think i would just cut their line if it's on top of mine!!!) it may be wrong but casting on top of someones line is wrong too.  I guess its a metter of opinion on that one!  "

If they were eastern European and never said a word it would be hard to profile their ethnicity.  I have a friend that has property up in northern Ontario and is of French Canadian decent, when I go up to visit him for some fishing he shows me his freezer that is stacked with fish that he has caught in the local lakes surrounding his camp. He follows the regs and keeps his limit on all fish but is clearly not obeying the “in possession” limit. When I ask him about it he says everybody does it. His father was like that with fishing and hunting practices as well and so on it goes …  I guess my point is that, all types of people cab be in violation of the regulations but closer to the populated areas certain visible minorities are easily identified and stereotyped, but in the remote regions it happens as well. We clearly need better enforcement ….. and that goes for the non-populated regions."

I've never had a ""roundeye"" pull up within feet of my boat, and cast right into my spot before....have you?? Sometimes, they get so close they actually bump into my boat....  I tend to keep my distance, and find my own fish. If I ever got that close to someone, call 911, because I'm having serious problems.  Its funny, because even when i try to make small talk with them, in a totally civil, friendly manner, I get no response. A simple question, like what colour are you using, gets ignored. They carry on talking in thier language, laughing and pointing fingers, but act as though they can't understand a word I say. A few minutes later, their cell phone rings, and they speak in perfect English. That's just RUDE, and IGNORANT!  I don't care if your white, black, or pink...if your rude and ignorant to others on the water, you are going to get centered out pretty quick, and people will not like you much. Keep it up, and it will seem like a racial issue, when in fact,it is not at all.  Trust me when i say I have NO PROBLEM with any one catching a legal limit of fish. I will be the first to keep mine, if I can, as well. To be so ignorant is just not acceptable, anywhere you go, in any culture.  It drives me nuts like you wouldn't believe, but I've given up on trying to stop it, and trying to educate. There is no hope. I've called the tips line I don't know how many times, with no results, and trying to explain to them that what they are doing is wrong, is like talking to a rock. It just doesn't work.

The fish are free for the taking and they are going to take until they are told by someone with authority NO. It was/is a way of life for them “back home” too skirt the law and get what they wanted because that was the only way to get anything. They don’t pass up on anything that is free; because wherever home was there weren’t too many freebees. If you’re brought up with generations of this kind thinking; it is going too take a few generations for it to change. Search back in your own family tree and find out what your great great great grandfather was doing in regards to conservation and how many generations it took for you and your family to have the mind set you have now. Is it right no, but it is human nature; get what you can get today because there might not be any tomorrow. Sad but it is how some societies have had to live and it will take time and enforcement to educate people that no really does mean no.  Dan."

694178,aplumma,2012-05-08 12:12:00,6896,We all have judgment points that we feel are critical to finding our social nitch. We do it every day in life conscious and subconsciously. The triggers may be less noticeable like what they do for a living you could be sharing a beer with a lawyer (no offence intended) and until you know he is a lawyer he was a great guy. You could be fishing next to a millionaire and until he pulls out his $300.00 fishing rod and his $40.00 cigar he was an good buddy. He then pulls out a second $40.00 cigar and gives it to you he is now back in your good graces.  Now that we find we judge people with all of our senses the easiest one is sight. We judge everything constantly we hate that car we like that dress we think that person is bad because of his tattoos or least we go there they have a genetic signature that is easy to identify. If you dislike someone because of a cultural belief then take the time to find out if they even follow that belief. I have an Asian friend who loves to talk like a redneck just to mess with people when he gets the stereotype vib.  The main root of prejudging people is to raise the level on which you stand. To support your self's worth in your eyes this is good for your esteem however it is a two edged sword judge to harshly or to often and others will see that you are beneath them for this action. Talk to the person for 5 min. then figure out if he is a positive or a negative in your life. It will keep you from missing out on some great friends and hopefully avoid the ones that truly are beneath you.   Art

Well this ""guy"" is watching us and keeps drilling holes closer and closer to my friend. No word of a lie, he finally drilled a hole 3 feet from my buddies hole. I had to hold my friend back from drilling him. We just left and didnt escalate it. Funny part is we moved a 100yards and he still didnt catch fish.  I dont care what a single person on here says about culture or ethnicity, some people are just Aholes.  I remember many years ago my other friend had a problem with some new ""canadians"" as they would come down to the local fishing hole and leave garbage and used diapers everywhere, so one day he walked down with a garbage bag grabbed the main person by the collar and made him clean it up.

I have spoken to members of a certain ethnic group hammering panfish on the Bewdley dock keeping absolutely everything. I asked why?? Those fish are too bony. The reply, they get ground up into a paste to be used as a condiment. My reply, If you keep fishing like that, there won't be any fish left in the lake. No reply. What do you do?? I'd call the MNR if there are any violations of the regs, and I don't care what race, colour, creed, religion or political views you have. One thing we all need to remember is that the people here before that certain ethnic group namely we white bread and the natives to North America fished out a lot of our waters and polluted the heck out of them first. It's up to all of us to manage our resources and it is incumbent upon each and everyone to report overfishing to the MNR. Hopefully the MNR can slow down the degredation of our resources.

694239,Paulus,2012-05-08 15:16:00,522,"Great post Cliff, and I think it was a tasteful way to bring it up. And why not talk about it? it exists and communication is the best way to get through it.  I agree with Bill on this one, but I will add that I notice a definite shift once you get into the 2nd and 3rd generations, for all cultures. This goes for my own culture, too (French Canadian). I speak to guys who want to catch their limit every time they come out and know quite a few who've acclimatized and are totally on board with not only following etiquette but catch-and-release.  One of my best friends and fishing buddies is from a completely different background. He’s first generation canadian and he has gone from one extreme to the other, from keep ‘em all to catch & release.  It takes a while, I think for the ownership and pride in the resources to sink in, and conservationism is a big part of that. In so many countries, there are either no regulations or no resources left – but this is a great counter-point to use in discussion with some of these folks. That is, the reason we have so much is because there are enough people who practice conservation – if they didn’t, you and I would not even have the chance to do so.  p.-"
694245,Headhunter,2012-05-08 15:24:00,5703,"So we are essentialy chasing our tail... two things come to mind... Can the resources close to our major centers sustain these numbers of catches? Given the number of new arrivals annually, let's say within the GTA, we will never see an end to this kind of thing. Sure 2nd and 3rd generation folks start to see the light, but new arrivals will simply follow their traditions... the fish are gonna take a beating. The only solution to this problem I can see is enforcement, enforcement enforcement... it only really hits home when it hits the wallet. HH"
694248,crappieperchhunter,2012-05-08 15:29:00,2582, Yep agree 100% here as well. Too bad the enforcement part will NEVER have the budget to tackle the problem successfully. Which is why 100 years from now fishing forums of the future will still be debating this same topic.
694285,Ron,2012-05-08 17:08:00,1683,"I have had several situations where where like Big Cliff said, ethnic groups have been a problem. Now I am certain Cliff meant more towards the word ethic.  1: We were float fishing off the West pier in Port Hope, a gentleman came in between us and decided to fish on the bottom interrupting everyone's drift. It didn't go over too lightly and eventually this man lost his footing and fell in the lake. What we do now is kindly tell the person to either change techniques or fish else where. If they don't comply, we carry on with our drift and every time someone hooks into their line, we pull their line in cut it off and continue with our fishing. If they were there first, we follow their techniques. No harm done.  2: In the winter months I personally spend much time clearing ice off the rivers in order to enjoy the fishing opportunities. If I am spending 3 - 4 hrs breaking ice only to have a guy come sit in his car and wait until the work is done then get out and fish, I have a problem with that. In fact I spent several hours braking ice, decided to grab a coffee to warm up and give the fish to relax then come back to fish. A group of guys came in the mean time and fished the area I had broken up. I grabbed my rod and they said there wasn't room for me to fish. So in a polite way, I brought it to their attention who opened the hole in the first place. Too bad they said. Well, I had no choice but to break up more ice in the same area. They looked at me in disgust as I was disturbing the fish. That's when the arguing and threats started by both parties. They eventually packed up and left.  3: I was fishing Crappies and a group of anglers in another boat came in literally casting over our lines. After frustration finally set in. I started up the main motor backed up to where we were catching our fish, trimmed up the motor and made it to the point no one was going to catch fish in the area. We left, found a new spot to fish and sure enough the same group of people came in this spot. Now these guys saw the ""roster tail"" my boat can make. I politely turned my boat towards their boat, gave it a small shot of gas. They understood what was going to happen next and quickly packed up their rods and anchor and promptly left.  4: Fishing in a high current river, to the point you can only back drift with the electric going full tilt. There is lots of room to go around and this group of anglers didn't have the respect of controlling their speed thus almost throwing us out of the boat. Education was key here as I followed suit only they were out of the boat and on shore as I went by. They soon understood what they did wrong and admittedly apologized for their actions.  5: The rest of the time I just look at them, shake my head and look the other way and leave.  Most of these instances were with people who could not call prejudice or minority.  I run into many people who are unethical, I look back at these few examples and find myself unethical for some of my actions as well."
694290,doubleheader,2012-05-08 17:32:00,497,"  Have to say i'm in agreement with Bucktai l00%. I find it very difficult to believe people don't know the regs, they just don't care, so our recourse is to report them. Another thing that seems to drive rude behavior is tournament fishing. Don't get me wrong I'm not anti tournament but I've experienced many times people doing things in a tournament they wouldn't think of doing on a casual outing. Just this weekend I had a guy I know pull right in front of me and anchor without saying a word. I waited til the boats were almost touching and said, ""No Hoss I don't mind if you pull right into where I've been fishing the last 3 hours."" Guys a jerk, but I wasn't going to get all bent up, life's too short."
694381,OutdoorDan,2012-05-08 22:54:00,325," I don't think it's any of these things.  It's a cultural/contextual divide.  If someone from Europe or Australia visits Canada and they get a meal at the restaurant and don't tip, is it because they don't respect/care about the waiter? No, it's because they are used to a different set of values and consider different things to be culturally appropriate.  The same thing is happening here.  I'm not really buying the financial argument either.  Even if you go somewhere that is an hour's drive away, you are likely spending at least 20$ bare minimum on gas.  So even ignoring the cost of a licence, tackle and equipment, the cost of the trip could get you several pounds of fish at the supermarket.  I only skimmed through this thread so sorry if this has been mentioned, but some people/cultures actually find it offensive/inappropriate to catch and release edible fish.  This concept shouldn't be hard to understand.  I am sure the hunters on this forum would be disgusted if I suggested that if you like to hunt but don't eat much meat, you should hunt with a tranquillizer gun, then take the picture while the animal is tranquillized, then go home, letting the animal get back to roaming shortly.  To some people, C&R is the same."
694419,chris.brock,2012-05-09 00:55:00,4053," maybe so, but here I would have to say, this is Canada, we catch and release, and it's vital to sustaining some fisheries, if you don't like it...................."
694439,OutdoorDan,2012-05-09 01:48:00,325," Just to clarify my position - I am not justifying the behaviours described in this thread.  I completely agree that there is so sustainability without C&R.  I'm not defending the behaviour.  I was just trying to explain that it's a more complicated and sensitive issue than just people having a lack of respect or being uneducated. Lots of people know the limits but choose to go over them just because they are wired differently.  Explaining things doesn't usually go far either because people will justify or find excuses anyway.  Ideally, you want to solve problems such as this through education and awareness but I don't think that works very well in practice.  What you need is stronger deterrence.  The reason most people don't go 150 on an empty highway isn't because they think it might be dangerous, but because if you go 50 over your car gets impounded.  Right now, the risks to minor poaching are so small that when people weigh risk/reward they choose to poach.  You are pretty unlikely to get caught in the first place, and even if you do the consequences seem pretty small.  I actually don't mind light punishments for lighter stuff (say you keep 2 walleye but one is in the slot).  The problem is that the consequences for the heavier stuff are non existent.  Every now and then, relatively major poaching stuff comes up in the News section of OOD and the consequences are a joke.  For poaching of big game you would often see something like losing your licence for a year and a fine in the 4 figure range.  When someone reads that, of course they are going to think that if they keep 75 crappies nothing will happen to them. And unfortunately, they are right."

694619,adempsey,2012-05-09 18:32:00,1498,"I've experienced the same issues as the original poster.  However, in my case, if I were to categorize all the jackasses into ""ethnic groups"" I'd say it's been predominantly white Canadians.  So, what does that mean?  It means absolutely nothing.  It's easy to judge from your personal experiences, but it's unfair to claim such broad generalizations based on them."
694049,Big Cliff,2012-05-08 00:55:00,6899,"On several occasions now I have observed members of a certain ethnic background fishing with apparent lack of respect for regulations and to be honest, just common courtesy.  Examples; keeping everything they catch even when they know they are grossly exceeding the limit.  Moving to within jumping distance of another boat or casting right on top of others if they see them catching fish.  Unfortunately my experiences seem to be directed at one ethnic group but those are my only experiences with this sort of thing in over 60 years of fishing.  Now I know there are members on this board of every ethnic background and plenty of lurkers so here is my question:  Why?  I have always judged a man by his actions, I have friends of every ethnic and religious background but I am finding myself starting to form a predigest. I don't like it but constant exposure to the attitude is wearing me down.  I would truly like to understand the ""why"" behind all of this. It might help me to be a little more tolerant.  So, if someone can enlighten me it would be truly appreciated.  It might also help some others understand why so much resentment is forming towards them!  Now Moderators, before you decide to lock this; I have not mentioned any specific ethnic group, any one that forms a conclusion does so of their own volition. I am not trying to promote any agression toward any particular group but I am trying to promote understanding. (for all)  I ask that you be tollerant in allowing people to express their views in the hope that it will promote better understanding for all. I really think we need it or the agression is going to continue to grow. Understanding on both sides could help save a lot of fishing opportunities for all of us."

694055,monsterfish,2012-05-08 01:11:00,48,"Regardless of ethnicity, its always lack of education on the subject!"
694059,EE_,2012-05-08 01:15:00,36,The day you mentioned you have an adopted brother of THAT ethnic group I figured this ethnic thing's been bothering you.....
694062,chris.brock,2012-05-08 01:16:00,4053,"Everybody has their own moral opinions on how to respect and harvest our natural resources. I'm a little closer to the ""tree hugger"" side, like it or not, if someone is breaking the law (too many fish, over limit etc.), that's definately wrong  the gov't is cutting everything, so more COs isn't likely going to happen"
694066,skidoosafari,2012-05-08 01:20:00,46, O boy----that's trouble.  But had to be said.
694068,mike rousseau,2012-05-08 01:22:00,4661,"i too have experienced situations with people of other ethnic backgrounds...  first one... my first salmon i ever hooked... fishing from shore... it was very clear i had a fish on because i was yelling it out loud.... then the ""ethnic"" fellow beside me casts right over my line... i later found out this is common... they do it in hopes that their hook makes it to the fish so they can argue they caught it and try to keep it...  like bill said... i dont think its as much about sport as it is feeding the family... or at least feeding them for free...  but either way we are lumping these people all in together and thats not really fair to those who set good examples and show proper etiquette...  ive seen plenty of ... shall we say ""not so ethnic"" anglers out there that deserve a slap in the back of the head as well...   maybe its a MAN OF THE FAMILY thing... the more fish and bigger fish he brings home the more of a man he is...  i dunno....  hope i didnt offend anyone..."
694073,chris.brock,2012-05-08 01:30:00,4053,could you explain this for us that aren't familiar with what you're talking about
694075,mercman,2012-05-08 01:32:00,7054,"I truly believe it is lack of education. Many of these ""ethnic"" anglers, do not understand english enough to read the regs, or get a licence. The education should come from inside thier community. If we take the time to show them in a way they can understand, hopefully they will stop this type of fishing practices."
694076,Dontcryformejanhrdina,2012-05-08 01:34:00,535,"Seriously, the guy cast over your line trying to snag your fish? Hahaha that's all kinds of pathetic.      There's idiots and jerks of any ethnic group."
694078,woodenboater,2012-05-08 01:35:00,2277,"I think what we're seeing is definitely a cultural divide. Depending on where they're from, this is something that may be considered normal and most likely related to putting food on the table no matter how. Of course, things are much different for them now that they're in Canada but I honestly believe this is something that is so ingrained in them that it may take some time to change.  Most of the above would be people fishing from shore as a boat would be financially impossible for them. My attitude towards them would depend on many factors but I *could* see letting it slide if they were filling their buckets with crappies and rock bass and it looked like they were trying to make ends meet. If they were acting like self righteous, entitled pieholes, well I'd be feeling uncharitable and would curse them to high hell (sotto voce...)  But yeah, education will be a slow process and require soft diplomacy."
694080,mike rousseau,2012-05-08 01:37:00,4661,"  in some cases maybe...  but i saw an ""ethnic"" angler club a 10+ pound walleye... when i asked if he was gunna eat it or mount it...he said ""neither... i just want a picture""   :wallbash:"
694083,chris.brock,2012-05-08 01:45:00,4053,"it's tough, everyone has their own ideals, who's to say what's right or wrong, just as an example, Don'tcryformejan... has a muskie at the dock (likely kept, or looks alot like it was kept) in his avatar, a few people on this board wouldn't think very highly of that (no offence don'tcryfor..) I know guys who fish bass tourneys and are very offended at anyone keeping bass for table fare, everyone has their own opinion, if nobody is breaking the regs., we really can't say anything"
694084,Dontcryformejanhrdina,2012-05-08 01:45:00,535,"  I also know of an oldtimer (who isn't ""ethnic"") that used to take a pistol with him and shoot muskies in the head whenever he caught one just because they eat other fish he wants to catch.  Ignorence doesn't discriminate, it's for everyone!"
694086,Dontcryformejanhrdina,2012-05-08 01:49:00,535," I caught it right out in front of the docks, my buddy trolled back while I unhooked it (in a net over the side of the boat, as you can see my net still over the side of the boat and not in it) since the people at the cottages wanted to see it. It was released. People can think whatever they want, doesn't make it true."
694088,chris.brock,2012-05-08 01:54:00,4053,"that's cool that you caught it and released it, nice fish too, I was just making the point that people have different opinions on fish and wildlife ethics, I'm sure some people noticed your avatar (there's quite a few muskie guys on here) and thought ""damn, that fish should have been released"", even though you could have legally kept it, and actually did release it"
694091,Twocoda,2012-05-08 01:59:00,4130,"I think the word ""ethnic"" should be changed to ""ethic"" ....it happens from every ethnicity but it just so happens we always seem to remain the same as we were before the infraction so its a violation to our ethnicity or a violation of our ethics... I think the solution here is to take a small break and try to see fishing in an enjoyable way again Cliff...trust me i do understand the frustration and when the day came that i threw another man in the river after several warnings....i knew it was time to take a break because i lost the reason along the line somewhere ....the true reason i love to fish...so now...when/if it happens i bide my time until the offender legitimately catches a fish ....and i return the favour to them...(this is also a great opportunity to test the strength of your leader line...  Try it ...it is actually fun if you know before hand ...that its just going to be ""one of those days""  Maybe a wee break to recharge your tolerance levels...and remind yourself why you do it...for the thrill of the ""what could be"" or the relaxation it gives to relieve the frustrations that may have you wound up a little tight..  Having said that ....if its derby time and your running on 5 hours sleep over the course of the week....then its a no brainer....deliver a strong verbal warning and if that doesnt work well....pay him a visit at the dock then his house then his work then his......  Although this thread has the fuel to be confrontational i hope nobdy drops the wrong match to get it flaming out of control"
694131,Musky or Specks,2012-05-08 03:41:00,2710,Its pretty simple really they come from a resource poor country. They come here and the resource seems plentiful so they feel they should take advantage of it to help them economically. These are a people that came here because they wanted a better life for themselves and for their families. Protein was a luxury for them and here its readily available with little effort. Education is the only answer and generational shift. Remember it was your ancestors that wiped out the Atlantic Salmon from over harvest and habitat destruction and its still us whities who are wiping out the brook trout stream by stream here in souhern ontario without even a second thought. So don't be to quick to point your finger.
694135,Dozer,2012-05-08 04:24:00,896,"Lack of respect, lack of education, fishing for food, lack of enforcement, they dont care about you and what you stand for..."
694140,Skipper D,2012-05-08 08:18:00,1970,"Cliff take two table spoons of this understanding and call me in the morning , aw the way it was so long ago has so very little space left in our worlds today , trust it will never be better now then it was today for all of us living in it where we do . Your only medication for thease things that bother you will come when the same things will bother the young and innocent many years from now . Seek out new places to be confortable in , let the world go bye so all will be well again and don't forget to take your fishing rod with you ."
694142,limeyangler,2012-05-08 08:29:00,5204,With all due respect why is ethnicity even an issue here? If someone is breaking the law they are breaking the law.
694157,Billy Bob,2012-05-08 10:43:00,5865,I know exactly what Cliff is talking about as I witnessed it first hand while staying at Cliff's last June.......I don't think this has anything to do with feeding the family due to economic reasons as the boat I watched take every under size walleye that came over the gunnel was a very expensive bass boat with every high end toy aboard it. And I believe Cliff is referring to boat anglers as he can monitor them VERY easily from his back yard deck which is about 20 feet above the water line.  Poaching is poaching.....we need to stop it no matter who is doing it.  Bob
694158,krixxer,2012-05-08 10:46:00,274,"Might it have to do with economics?  mum works at timmys for 10.75/h and she only gets 4 shifts a week otherwise she would be F/T and eligible for benefits.  Dad moonlights, it the daytime he drives fork lift @ 13.00/hour and at night drives pizza in a 15 year old corrolla hoping I'll make it one more week without that brake job.  3 kids in high school that all want Iphones oh and rent 1200/mo  ....on the weekend dad WALKS down to the marina sits on his bucket and figures he CAN afford 1 iphone for the kids to share iif does not spend all that money on groceries."
