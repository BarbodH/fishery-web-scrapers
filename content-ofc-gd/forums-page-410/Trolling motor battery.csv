695009,super dave,2012-05-10 20:20:00,323,"Due to limited storage space, I use an inflatable one man pontoon boat with trolling motor strapped to the motor mount.  Usually I just row but the last few outings I put on the trolling motor.  My question is, does the battery have to be covered?  Whats the risk of having it exposed?  I do strap the thing down so it doesn't slide off."
695010,mercman,2012-05-10 20:25:00,7054,"Make sure you keep metalic objects like fish net frames,uncovered metal leaders etc,away from the terminals. You should be fine.You can also buy battery terminal protectors at CT for really cheap."
695020,DRIFTER_016,2012-05-10 21:26:00,10439,I stick mine in a cheap case and strap it down. This way I don't hve to worry about shorting it out or having the battery go for a swim. I just have a super cheap cover and use a long cam strap wrapped around it and the rear platform.  You can see it in this picture behind my seat.  
695021,davey buoy,2012-05-10 21:30:00,5505,Your not worried about heat build up or venting?.
695027,DRIFTER_016,2012-05-10 21:35:00,10439, Nope. They only produce hydrogen gas when being charged so it's not an issue. If you need to charge it in the boat the cover needs to be removed so there is your venting.
695046,irishfield,2012-05-10 22:14:00,26272,Without a cheap plastic battery box surrounding it.. you are taking the chance of battery acid eating your craft!
695054,Billy Bob,2012-05-10 23:05:00,5865,I don't remove my cover on my deep cycle battery and it's hooked up to the on-board charger any time I am not fishing....including right now.....been doing that for about 10  years without any issues.
695058,davey buoy,2012-05-10 23:29:00,5505, I had always heard good ventilation while charging is a must.
695074,whiskywizard,2012-05-11 00:46:00,305,"Battery cases have ventilation incorporated into the lid design. On larger boats, the case lids are seldom removed.  See the hood vents, 2 on each end?    "
695173,smally21,2012-05-11 11:55:00,993,"i wouldn't imagine on board charging is much of a consideration in a one man inflatable. covering the terminals would seem prudent. you couldn't lay something across the terminals if you tried, but if you weren't trying you can do it easily...  Drifter yer inflatable pontoon looks awesome. looks like it should have a machine gun mount and some navy seals in it.."
695177,Djeep,2012-05-11 12:13:00,199,i want a pontoon like this so bad. yours looks really sweet drifter.  do you guys find that a pontoon like that needs a trolling motor or is it alright to paddle?
695251,DRIFTER_016,2012-05-11 15:00:00,10439,  I paddles fine but the electric does make life easier. A lot of guys use fins for positioning but I have a bad knee which makes it pretty painful. That's one of the reasons I sold my float tube and replaced it with a toon. Rowing is good exercise especially out on the lake.
695314,super dave,2012-05-11 17:56:00,323,"rowing is fine but a bit tricky.  pontoons don't have a keel to keep it straight so it takes a bit of getting used to.  I mostly float down rivers but for ponds, lakes and reservoirs, I'll throw on the motor, mainly because I like to troll."
