Mostly our fault though as our primary method is with worms and we forgot to buy them. They didn't have any for sale in the park yet either. We spent the day tossing all the artificials we had but didn't have any luck....  Anyway here are a few pictures to browse...

I think we shoulda probably just dumped some whater or something and dug some up... but it's nice to just get back out to our little fishing hole and enjoy the air. Fish are only a bonus on this trip."
