897147,outllaw,2015-02-10 14:57:00,1232,anders great post I firmly believe in harvest and eat. the one thing is to me . bears and other critters not put in check. like said before black bears have created a way into the whole scenario. the mnr and parliament just cant wrap there heads around a problem they have created.. as for the bling. I had a lee enfield 303.. killed bullwinkles just fine lol
897203,Sinker,2015-02-10 19:16:00,8692,"Anyone have any other suggestions on what to do about a failing moose population??  I hunt for food. No bling involved whatsoever. I probably have the cheapest kit possible, but I'm the same with fishing. Cheap and effective.  Its the camraderie, the sunrises, sunsets, time with family, friends and kids......there is so much more to hunting than killing something. If your caught up in the bling, your being blinded by it.

897239,pics,2015-02-10 21:43:00,1268,Doug hit the nail on the head.. we spend 2 weeks in the bush in a trailer that is comfortable but not fancy. We bow hunt so we don't meet up with many others while out there and we can go years without shooting one. The point is getting out and slowing down for a couple of weeks. I wish the MNR had a better strategy for moose management than what we have now...

It is surely possible that the moose have moved or are thriving in different areas, but there are not a lot of eyeballs saying that they have seen this.....as far as I am hearing.  Doug"

Try telling that to anyone in any small northern community where the fall moose/deer/bear hunt is a rite of passage, and an important family gathering that doesn't have a damn thing to do with consumerism, flashy gear or anything of the like.  To generalize the entire hunting community like that is pretty ridiculous, not to mention downright false."
897641,anders,2015-02-12 13:23:00,1168,"i think why the moose count seems to be low, or why hunters are not seeing more like they use to, is due to logging.  in the past most hunts were done around clear cuts, new and old logging roads etc.  with the decline in the wood industry here in Ontario we have seen an almost dead stop in logging.

If moose HUNTERS are not seeing moose where they have been hunting for many years, it is likely that moose populations are indeed diminishing in those areas.  We also know that when whitetail deer reach a certain population per square mile that they impact on the moose.  The deer carry a fatal parasite which does not kill deer, but does kill moose.  During the mild spell of winters a few years back, there were big populations of BIG deer in Northern Ontario in locations where deer were not normally present, or not in any great numbers, and they did displace moose in those areas."

I started bow hunting 20+ years ago,since then the whole experience has been about having a close encounter with the game. Allmost nothing gets your blood up like a big bull responding to your call,a moose looks very big at 8yds.

896996,akaShag,2015-02-09 21:09:00,2073,"Like the OFAH says, THIS government only wants to handle licenced and law-abiding moose HUNTERS, not the moose populations per se.  As long as licenced hunters continue to bear the brunt of ALL moose population rehabilitation (or even stabilization) efforts, the plans are doomed to failure.  I admit I do not like the moose calf harvest, but it is about the most palatable alternative for hunters who look forward year by year to their annual hunt.  If there are not enough adult moose to sustain the population, killing calves is not likely to help.  BUT!  I don't think that many calves are actually harvested, so at least hunters have an opportunity to get out in the moose woods.  I am going to hunt moose this year in the Yukon.......................and know lots of guys who are hunting moose in Quebec and Newfoundland instead of Ontario.

Maybe not sole food source, but it can be an important food source and it should be respected as a Canadian tradition.

I know nothing of polar bears; if the populations can sustain a hunt then go ahead."
897048,Steve,2015-02-09 23:43:00,2075,my uncle hunts moose.  the amount of money he has tied up in his hunting toys could buy his family meat until his kids have their own grand kids.  let's face it. folks hunt for the sport of hunting.  the resulting food is a bonus.  and there isn't a single thing wrong with that.   edit: spelling.

897060,akaShag,2015-02-10 00:05:00,2073,"I am unable to do a ""cut and paste"" or ""quote"" on this board, which can be a PITA...............  But ANYWAYS, back to Gerritt............I do not agree at all with your premise.  I have been hunting for almost fifty years, and I can tell you that, in Canada, in the modern era, hunting is MUCH, MUCH more than ""putting food on the table.""  That may have been one of the primary reasons that past generations hunted, but I am certain (having read books from long ago) that mere food is just one of the reasons our ancestors hunted, and just one of the reasons why we modern-day hunters go out.  It is about connecting with the land and nature in a very primeval way, taking everything in with all of one's senses, sometimes (but not often) having an opportunity to take an animal, and then taking that animal and making it into food.  The experience is far more than killing something for food.  ""BLING"" might be part of some people's experience, but I guarantee that MOST hunters do not hunt for the opportunity to show off their toys.  Do YOU hunt?  (If you don't mind me asking?)Doug"
897061,Steve,2015-02-10 00:10:00,2075,"i agree with everything you wrote Doug. What you outline is the reason I fish.  But, my uncle often takes guided hunts in which they ""bait"" animals....sometimes going as far as watching individual animals on trail cams to the point they name them and pre plan when they are going to shoot the animal.  That kinda goes against your theory.  Do you take guided hunts and do you bait?"

(oh and maybe carp fishermen...)"
897067,akaShag,2015-02-10 00:41:00,2073,"back to Steve............yes that is also why I fish, and (when I was still able to do so), did cross-country skiing, snowshoeing, canoeing, back-country camping, etc.  It is all about connecting with the land and with ""Mother Nature,"" in all her glories.  I have not done a guided hunt, but have no philosophical objection to them.  The extreme which you mention does sound that - very extreme, and I wonder if it is what most of us might call a ""canned"" hunt, ie one behind an enclosure where the ""wild"" animals really are not so wild at all.  Most hunters have a personal boundary of what constitutes, for them, fair chase and by extension, for them what is ""sportsmanlike.""  I suppose the gender-neutral term would be ""sporting.""  Baiting is a pretty emotional topic, even amongst hunters.  For example:  If a person wants to hunt black bears in Ontario, his or her chances of even SEEING a bear on a give day afield, without baiting, are maybe one in a hundred thousand in most areas of the province where there is an open season. It might be one in ten thousand or one in a million, in other words an order of magnitude one way or the other.  Regardless, that's pretty slim odds.  Consider, if you will, my own experience.  I am a pretty good hunter and have taken over a hundred Ontario white-tailed deer, with bow, rifle, shotgun and muzzle-loader.  I hunt MANY days every year in pursuit of deer.  In my Ontario hunting experience, I have hunted roughly half of my days in areas that also hold black bear.  I have never seen a single black bear whilst hunting.  Not one, in hundreds of days afield over many years.  In the last few years I have been hunting with a camp not far from here where bears are present, and where bait is put out for the bears.  In three years of hunting over bait, I did not see one bear.  In that camp, one bear was shot this year, and one three years ago.  Hunting over bait also allows hunters a chance to see if the bear is a boar or a sow, and whether there are any cubs around.  Virtually no hunter will shoot a sow, and especially one with cubs.  So baiting has its place, IN MY OPINION, for hunting Ontario black bear.  Baiting for other species has its pros and its cons, and of course is illegal for some species.  But in general, if baiting allows a hunter to take a humane shot at an animal the hunter determines to be legal and one that he/she wants to kill, yes I am in favour of baiting.  To use a fishing analogy, I also used to put chum down for whitefish, since my own experience fishing for whities without chum was not exactly spectacular.  Sorry for the long-winded response, but it seems to me that anglers and hunters have enough ""ANTIS"" arrayed against us that those of us who hunt and fish need to stand together and not bicker at each other over perceived differences.  We need to correct thinking that we think is wrong, as I was trying to do in my response to Gerritt - but at the end of the day we need to stand united.  JMOYMVDoug"
897069,Steve,2015-02-10 00:45:00,2075,that you for that long winded response. It was very well done and greatly appreciated.  And I also agree to stand united.  I will never ever shoot an animal. But I will not look down at another who does.

All of the outdoor sports are expensive these days.  Take a look at what a pair of snowshoes costs!!!!!!  But yes for sure it is possible to hunt on a limited budget, just as it is possible to fish on a limited budget.  LICENCES are much more money for the hunter, but travel expenses are similar and really so are gear expenses if a person knows what they are doing.  YES I can buy a firearm for fifty bucks, and less (for example).  But let's agree to disagree about bling.
