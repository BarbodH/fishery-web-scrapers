896943,SmokestackLightnin,2015-02-09 15:25:00,390,"Put a hut out just west of Shanty Bay 3 weeks ago, in 100' of water.  Things are slow, not much being caught and the fish that have been caught are full of minnows and barley.  I suspect it will pick up once March rolls around.  Probably back in the hut on Wednesday.  2 trips to Haliburton back lakes, I can't believe the amount of snow and slush.  The tracks are great on my ATV but nothing works on slush.  Buried it in slush in the middle of the lake last week, but got it out pretty quickly thanks to the winch, power auger and large tree branch.  Iced 6 splake in the 2 trips.  Haven't hit any speck lakes but will once the weather gets a little more tolerant for those of us who fish without a shelter."
896948,Acountdeleted,2015-02-09 15:42:00,2562,"I first came to this forum about 4 years ago because I had no idea what I was doing for ice fishing. I had a $10 ice combo and a $40 crappy tire auger and if I caught 3 perch in a day I was doing really well. Between awesome advice on the forums and meeting people in person who were willing to show me fishing techniques I STILL CATCH NO FISH BUT HAVE SPENT $5000+ ON GEAR!!! THANKS A LOT!!!  All kidding aside, the reports are great on here but it's the info and the people. It's also in asking the right questions. You can't see a report and say 'what lake was that? What were your GPS co-ordinates?' But you can say 'how deep were you fishing?' 'What were they biting on?'  It's like back at school. If the teacher gives you the answer, you may pass the test but you will never comprehend.  The reports are nice but it's the people and the information that has been invaluable to me."

That is why this board has thrived over the years while many others have not. We are a diverse group of people with a wide variety of intrests and opinions but we share a common love; fishing.  As for fishing reports it is really hard to post anything of substance anymore without offending someone, locations tactics, to keep or not to keep. I gave up a while ago because someone thought everyone would know I must be talking about Sturgeon Lake because that is where I live and I shouldn't be telling people how the fishing was here.

As for the fishing reports, I don't think there are many that do it anymore.  I lost that urge many years ago.  Too many freeloaders out there on the Internet.  I just like to read about different things that touch on fishing, and if a target thread pops up, I can choose to read it or not.  Fishing forums are just enjoyable places to pass the time for me, I don't get wrapped up in them, it's not real life.  There isn't much here that phases me. The only thing I don't love is the advertisement reports, but even then you get to know the players and can choose to skip their posts, so no big deal!  I sometimes find I get the most interesting info out of non fishing threads."

Look back 2 or 3 years in the archives and there's quite a few locked report threads where discussions turned nasty.  I for one agree with you Mike, I used to love read reports here but it certainly not because reporters are getting lazy... I recall several times where someone has stated ""I will never post another report here ever again"". Looks like they were true to their word."

The ice reports we do get like the beauty from Moosebunk are tough to compare to reporting 3 keeper Perch and a Whitefish or 2 so I don't think most even bother.
