897557,solopaddler,2015-02-12 00:20:00,8605,I now know that I'll be out of her hair for sure! What else could a gal ask for after 36 years?  A muffler and break pads?
897559,irishfield,2015-02-12 00:21:00,26272,Did that last month.... as well as 5 new brake lines and a front hub!
897561,misfish,2015-02-12 00:22:00,29133," A muffler and break pads?  She has a new snow plow truck to play with while he,s away Mike.  Now thats love. LOL"

897586,bigugli,2015-02-12 01:44:00,6138,We go out  for some fun.
897589,Handlebarz,2015-02-12 01:50:00,3790,I'm getting mine a one way train ticket to Toronto so she can join me for musky Sunday and family day at the spring boat and fishing show.
897610,i2cool2fool,2015-02-12 04:28:00,349,I will be cooking (and cleaning up after) a nice meal for my darling wife and 5 year old daughter. They are excited. It will be a break from the everyday. I don't do it often enough due to work commitments but they absolutely love it anytime I take / make the opportunity.
897613,mike rousseau,2015-02-12 06:16:00,4661,She got a new van...  And we are doing a family ice fish on Saturday... And after the kids are asleep order some munchies and try to find a good movie...
897621,Moosebunk,2015-02-12 08:02:00,3970,I'll likely have to give her a phone call on Valentines Day.
897650,glenner,2015-02-12 14:08:00,56,"I'm lucky to be married to a girl who isn't a fan of Valentine's day - she calls it the day that a lot of men use to try and make up for what they do (or don't do) the rest of the year, so we have never treated it as anything special. Instead, I show up with flowers at random times during the year for ""no reason at all"" and get a lot more mileage out of that. It's been working for 35 years so i must be doing something right"
897655,NAW,2015-02-12 15:13:00,4022,"I wasn't going to get her anything..  But last night, she told me she has already bought me something.  So know I need to starting thinking about something.  I'll hit up Victoria Secret on my way home Friday.  Get her something pink."

897759,Big Cliff,2015-02-12 22:00:00,6899,"When Sue and I first got together we both had debts and not a lot of money left over so the very first Valentine's day I couldn't afford to give her much but I did give her a single red rose because she was the ""One and Only"", (and it was all I could afford) and I cooked her a nice dinner dinner of fresh trout (her favorite food is anything to do with fish).  33 years later and I still give her a single red rose because she is still the One and Only and I am still cooking her a really nice dinner. This year it is going to be scallops, crab legs, lobster tails, and a maple crusted salmon fillet with a side of brown and wild rice. I'll probably pick up a bottle of her favorite red wine too (I realize that red wine isn't supposed to go with seafood but it does go with the red rose LOL).  What Sue gives me in return...... I'll never tell"

We both know what the other one wants or needs and make an effort 12 months of the year to look after those things.  Used to be a restaurant in town that had a real nice Valentine's day special menu supper.  Bottle of wine, appetizers a few selections for your main course and a few great dessert choices. Looked forward to that but they have stopped doing it."
