897236,Locnar,2015-02-10 21:36:00,645,"After a gruelling 12 hours of snow removal yesterday... mostly shovelling... I had a hard time waking up this morning. A little later than planned. I hit the road at about 7:15am, wanted to be out the door by 6:30, but I didn't get out of bed til 6:45. After a short detour, which cost me about 20 minutes of driving around peterborough... oops haha... and after stopping for a coffee and bait I got to the lake at about 9:30.  Drilled a few holes and away I went. Didn't take too long to get into fish, caught about 5 in 3 hours. Missed a couple as well. I noticed some stuff that looked like some weird plant material floating up into my hole after a couple hours... but upon closer inspection they turned out to be insects. It looked kind of like a balled up leaf with a  small insect sticking out one end of it. Probably had like 30 of them in one hole. Forgot to take any pictures of them, should have though. Any ideas on what they'd be?  Here's a photo of one of the fish from the morning. "
897242,Joeytier,2015-02-10 21:45:00,3990,Beautiful bows man.  Too bad I'm stuck at work on a beautiful day like this.  My off days line up nicely with the return of the -30 temps haha
897245,Locnar,2015-02-10 21:48:00,645,"Hahaha, crappy buzz man. I'm stuck on EI so I've been picking and choosing the best days to hit the ice... in between the snow storms cuz I get called in for Snow removal."
897246,Acountdeleted,2015-02-10 21:49:00,2562,Very nice. Great day to be out on the ice.
897247,Meegs,2015-02-10 21:50:00,249,Nicely done.   Makes up for waking up late
897261,S.M.05,2015-02-10 22:16:00,145,"Nice bow! Love the deep red color. First day on medical EI for me, unfortunately wont be able to fish for at least a couple months.  Tight lines"
897272,misfish,2015-02-10 22:52:00,29133,Nice fish and what a beauty of a day to be out.
897536,spincast,2015-02-11 23:31:00,3279,"beauty colours, and a nice catch rate."
897585,Sharkbait22,2015-02-12 01:39:00,297,Nice bow Insect likely caddis larvae http://twistedsifter.com/2013/03/caddisfly-larvae-cases/
897591,Locnar,2015-02-12 02:02:00,645,That's exactly what they were! Thanks buddy. I'm sure they'd work as bait as well?
897603,Acountdeleted,2015-02-12 03:30:00,2562,"Locnar, Denis McGee would karate chop you if he heard you question the power of the caddis. I think it's the only fly he ever ties."
897616,Moosebunk,2015-02-12 07:44:00,3970,Who doesn't like rainbows eh?
897639,Locnar,2015-02-12 13:09:00,645,I don't doubt they're working power. The hole that had about 20 of em floating in it caught all the fish.
