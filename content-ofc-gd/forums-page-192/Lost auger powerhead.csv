896951,porkpie,2015-02-09 15:49:00,2521,Lost out of Beaverton this morning.  Likely between the perch grounds and the first crack.  Please PM if found.  It was an eskimo stingray.
896952,Mister G,2015-02-09 16:15:00,1429,WOW...........Good Luck.
896956,DanD,2015-02-09 16:37:00,2223,"It may not hurt to call the hut operators in and around Beaverton; maybe if someone finds it, they may turn it in at one of those guy's offices?  I lucked out when one of the rhino grips broke and my auger went off the back of the snowmobile. I didn't realize it was gone, until a guy waved me down and pointed it out to me.  Here's wishing you luck getting it back.  Dan."
896959,misfish,2015-02-09 16:47:00,29133,That sucks dude. Sure hope some honest person gets it back to you.
896960,ketchenany,2015-02-09 16:47:00,3229,Been there! Manual 6 inch  Good luck.
896961,porkpie,2015-02-09 17:10:00,2521,"Thanks fellas.  I have word in at Hales, and will call around.  Thank god we had a manual in the truck.  Burned near a tank of fuel in the sled looking.  Good thing I have a sense of humour, and the herring are biting.  Didn't have the heart to head out to laker grounds again."
