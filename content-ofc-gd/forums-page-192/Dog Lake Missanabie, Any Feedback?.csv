897533,Joeytier,2015-02-11 23:24:00,3990,Do your research.  The lake is very remote but has had many lodges on it for decades and is definitely a pressured fishery.  I would consider other options if you're really interested in high quality fishing
897534,James77,2015-02-11 23:27:00,175,"Thanks Joey. I've searched the thread and it doesn't seem to be the greatest fishery available. A lot of the posts are from 4-10 years ago, wondering if anyone has been there recently and might be able to chime in.  Thanks once again. James."
897537,Joeytier,2015-02-11 23:31:00,3990,"My dad was there this past summer.  Lake is huge and the wind was high almost the entire week (close to n. shore of superior so weather is a wildcard).  Walleye fishing was mostly terrible, don't remember exact numbers, only the massive disappointment haha  I'm sure the lake produces good fishing at times, but if you're making a substantial trip like I definitely would not reccomend it.
