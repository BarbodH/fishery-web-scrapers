897681,manitoubass2,2015-02-12 17:51:00,11391,Family day on feb 16th people.  No license needed for fishing either.  Start making plans now and get your family out FISHING!!!
897683,Acountdeleted,2015-02-12 17:53:00,2562,Taking a large group of us out to cooks. A lot of my families first time ice fishing. My grandfather's mouth is watering at the possibility of all the perch he will have to fry up.
897684,manitoubass2,2015-02-12 17:56:00,11391, Dont forget our elders or disabled!!!!
897687,chris.brock,2015-02-12 18:07:00,4053,No trail pass required for OFSC trails either this weekend (you have to go online and print something off though)  Me and a few guys are in a derby Sunday. What sucks is the forecast says -21 for a high in Minden Sunday = cooped up in a portable all day
897694,manitoubass2,2015-02-12 18:26:00,11391,Ah I didnt know that Chris!!!  Miigwich
897701,LostAnotherOne,2015-02-12 18:52:00,956,A few ice tournaments going on too dude.  Check out 400eleven ice fishing tournaments for info.
897702,Acountdeleted,2015-02-12 18:56:00,2562,Maybe just me (I'm going to catch a lot of flack for this but I'm willing to debate and be swayed)  Should they really be hosting fishing derbies on family fishing weekend? The lakes are already going to be getting enough pressure and it allows guys to enter derbies who don't have their licence and may not know the best catch and release practices.
897704,Fang,2015-02-12 19:00:00,1330,"trying for the wife, son and his girlfriend  Anyone know of a spot withing 30 minutes of Oakville, that is less than a 10 minute walk and has a Tim Horton's with free wifi."
897705,manitoubass2,2015-02-12 19:03:00,11391,"Ive hosted derbies on family day.  Smaller derbies though.  The anglers have been nothing but awesome! Even had some 2 year olds out last year and you as the derby director, just make your rounds and help teach them.  Id rather families be out fishing and enjoying nature. Sure you might lose a few fish but thats a small drop in the bucket compared to giving a kiddo the fishing bug and spending a day away from screens and video games.  Derbies are kinda the easiest way to ensemble the people with no experience.  To me its a win win.  But my derbies are small, 100 people usually.  A much bigger one may pose more problems?  But if Ive had one family have a blast, ill sleep good at night.  Its about nature, family and teaching the kids.  To me thats nothing but positive?"
897707,LostAnotherOne,2015-02-12 19:08:00,956,"Maybe your right Jeremy84.  I'm sure a lot of guys are going to be taking the fish home without a license, but its legal unfortunately.  It's also ice fishing so you may not get a whole lot of people barring the weather.  In the end the lakes will take a hit, but for the cost of spending time with ones family.  No big loss.  Maybe it will turn more people into fishing which will increase the revenue in sales from licenses so the ministry can hire more officers.  Just my two cents bud."
897708,AKRISONER,2015-02-12 19:10:00,5558,IMO it should run all weekend. I dont think many people are gonna be taking their kids out on monday with a high of -21...Ill be out Saturday and will hopefully be able to bring the kids out for at least a bit.
897709,manitoubass2,2015-02-12 19:15:00,11391,"And I should also mention, at least my derby, is catch, measure release.  No keepers"
897710,LostAnotherOne,2015-02-12 19:20:00,956,Good to hear manitoubass2.  Good stuff
897711,Acountdeleted,2015-02-12 19:22:00,2562,Island lake is probably your best bet. Might be an hour but fullfils all of your requirements.  That's fair with the smaller derbies. I may be imagining a worst case scenario I just have this horrid vision of some guy in his mid 30's greesing out some poor 5 year old to get this biggest fish in a derby.
897713,manitoubass2,2015-02-12 19:39:00,11391,"A 12 year old girl won my derby last year!  As well as the youth angler award (fully stocked tackle box, 2 ice fishing rods and a shimano clarus rod, and a leather embroidered jacket)"
897714,manitoubass2,2015-02-12 19:43:00,11391,"We had many raffles as well, a live band after the derby, and a pot luck.  I love small community derbies!  Oh we also had a youth talent show!!!"
897723,Acountdeleted,2015-02-12 20:16:00,2562,This derby sounds fantastic!
897728,manitoubass2,2015-02-12 20:36:00,11391,"Thanks jeremy!  It was awesome! The support was nothing short of outstanding!  Unfortunately I had to cancel this year because we lost a great community member and his family wanted to hold a derby in his name. And after much thought I believe the respectful thing to do was cancel mine, and direct traffic to his(they shared many friends)  But I still had some unreal donations this year and it will all go to youth anglers! Miigwich to those that donated, you know who you are!  I just love doing these derbies man, everyone has fun, their so appreciative and it just warms my heart.  But I will be back next year with the best derby I can possibly organize"
897736,manitoubass2,2015-02-12 21:00:00,11391,"If this doesnt get you stoked I dont know what will?  This lil guy endured horrible weather and slush, and landed two walleyes on his own?  I believe he was 3 maybe 4. He had a blast.  I think derbies for family day are awesome, as long as they are planned good:) "
897737,LostAnotherOne,2015-02-12 21:04:00,956,Sounds like you take a lot of pride in your work.  Good for you man
897748,wormdunker,2015-02-12 21:34:00,1711,Good for you Manitoubass.  Sounds well organized & a family event.  I hope all of you enjoy yourself.
897755,DOS,2015-02-12 21:46:00,119,"Heads up, its the whole weekend that a licence is not required, sat-mon.  Have fun out there  Dan"
897769,SirCranksalot,2015-02-12 22:33:00,3291,"trying for the wife, son and his girlfriend  Anyone know of a spot withing 30 minutes of Oakville, that is less than a 10 minute walk and has a Tim Horton's with free wifi.   ?? A bit much to ask for, don't you think?    A fishing video game might be the best bet---nobody need to get cold!"
897770,grizzlybri,2015-02-12 22:40:00,565,"I helped out with the derby in Brighton last year that Presqu'ile Bay Outfitters put on, it was great seeing 100+ kids fishing"
