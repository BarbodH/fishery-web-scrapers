897422,Lunkerhunter,2015-02-11 16:03:00,455,awesome report pete!!! cant wait to see what 2015 brings us.
897480,msp,2015-02-11 18:32:00,1336,Holy $hit............. Nice muskies dude . well done
896625,Fisherpete,2015-02-07 21:07:00,1814,"Winter is simply far too long... although I like ice and spring fishing, chasing big muskies is my bread and butter. There's just something about these toothy beasts that drives me. As many of you know, I've been trying hard to get that 50"" fish for over ten years now, and 2014 was finally the year that it happened. Twice. The first being an absolutely perfect LOTW specimen, flawless and girthy from tip to tail. I couldn't ask for a nicer fish as my first fifty. The second was an even longer specimen from the St. Lawrence... throw in a few very nice Kawartha fish including a personal best tiger muskie and this was my best season bar none. I didn't come close to the 109 muskies I landed in 2010, but quality certainly made up for it. Enough chatter, here's the pictures.  Kawarthas  44""      44"" Tiger      45""    45""      46""        48""      Lake of the Woods  48.5""          51""              St. Lawrence River  53.5""              Anyone else wish it was June?  Pete      "
