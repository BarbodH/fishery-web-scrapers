896857,LostAnotherOne,2015-02-08 23:37:00,956,"Geez Steve how many games have you seen live this year lol.  Went to see them play Carolina and of course they lost.  We got standing seats and only paid $58 a ticket.  Right at the top, but it was well worth it and from money we saved we bought a few more beers."
896859,Steve,2015-02-08 23:41:00,2075,"I'm very fortunate.  The company I work for has a box and 10 seats in the arena.  I work in sales so I get to use them quite often. However, I understand it's business first, hockey second....yes, it's evil, but I enjoy it.  Lots of us ""suits"" that ""ruin"" the game truly enjoy the Leafs. I'm not the only one."
896861,irishfield,2015-02-08 23:44:00,26272,And everyone wonders why their insurance rates are high!! LOL... Sorry Steve.. I couldn't resist sitting here staring at my $4100 home renewal.... composing an email to my broker!
896863,Steve,2015-02-08 23:49:00,2075,"Don't worry bud, my home and auto rates are super high as well. i can't even afford to be insured by the company I work for.  The ones in the drivers seat right now are large scale commercial companies, especially contractors, or those who need insurance for construction projects.  I started in the industry in 2006. In the last 9 years commercial insurance prices have DROPPED almost 40%. Yes, dropped.  Unfortunately insurance companies look towards personal property and personal auto to make up that difference.  But, no more thread jack.  Go Leafs!"
896878,darsky,2015-02-09 00:35:00,586,.....makes me appreciate the success the habs are having. Possible coach of the yr award.Possible mvp with Price.New drafts like Gallagher and Galechanyuk performing. Pacioretty playing like the next capt. Good owners and management. All is good. Never thought we'd ever be able to maybe sweep a season series with Boston........
896881,SirCranksalot,2015-02-09 01:07:00,3291,"Good owners and management.  Therein lies the difference!! The Leafs have the opposite. It was a grossly dysfunctional org for decades during the Ballard years etc and I'm not sure how much of an improvement has been made since. Few, if any, of the 'oldtimers' who won the cup could manage a good thing to say about the org. Bower, Dick Duff & others have been quoted in the paper being critical of the Leaf org. Keon would not attend the 'reunion' or whatever you call it a few years back. Such a poor org cannot bring out the best in players. That's why you see so many play better before and after they play for the Leafs."
896973,jimmer,2015-02-09 18:10:00,2730,"They had their hands tied going into the cap era and the management still hasn't learned. Not much that can be done but show some more patience. I looked at their draft history over the last 20 years, hopefully the newer scouts can have a better showing. Not sure what they can get by making trades with playoff contenders during the season. Everyone wants something for nothing if they are in the playoff race. They can also stop giving out 7M contracts. There are only a handful of players in the league that are worth that and none are on the Leafs. Hey; whatever became of Luca Cereda?"
896982,Steve,2015-02-09 18:41:00,2075,"well, scratching Clarkson Saturday night was a good start."
896986,ch312,2015-02-09 19:26:00,1590,"Thinking there is something to help the leafs turn things around is like thinking there's hope that politicians will be honest someday. You can hope and dream all you'd like, but there's no chance in heck it'll ever happen.   However, I must say their recent 11 game losing streak was quite the spectacular performance and the whopping 11 goals was equally impressive. At least they're breaking records this season...."

896676,ctranter,2015-02-07 23:34:00,543,"Funny how people state ""leafs aren't getting McDavid"", with no intelligent regard for statistics or probability.  It is highly unlikely the leafs get McDavid (fixed). But then it's unlikely for any bottom 5 team to get him, even the bottom team (whose odds max out at 20%). Nobody is betting their life savings on 1/5 odds, unless they are crazy"

896684,grizzlybri,2015-02-07 23:59:00,565,"me and Jeremy84 were talking today and neither of us can remember what song they play when the leafs score (at home),  As for why I'm watching as bad as it sounds it is like people that rubber neck they want to see how bad it is. and it seems like the leafs are to busy looking back to see what is coming up right in front of them.  as for the potential 1st overall, say the leaf to get it, what is saying they keep it away. and if they keep it, what is to say he is NHL ready next year? Look at Edmonton with all of their high draft picks, have Edmonton improved with all of these top 5 overall picks? How much better could they be if they spent time in the minors (AHL)?  So my big question is as a Leaf fan is, What if Toronto doesn't get the 1st overall pick or trades a potential top 5 pick away again?"

To me there are only 3 maybe 4 ""keepers"" the rest should be blown up. Again easy to say but tough to do. McDavid is not the savour, but would be nice to have. BTW whoever it was that said playing D is easy has probably never played D."
896748,Canuck2fan,2015-02-08 15:21:00,1444,"Leafs need to get rid of the foreign players who are just here for the money and bring in good local Canadian players who want to play with heart and pride.   That is a great plan...... Except for one thing, there is no legacy of winning that any NHLer can remember or relate too in Toronto. I remember hearing every Leaf fan say when Harold goes we will win Lord Stanley's Cup every year. WELL still waiting and he has been dead and gone for how long? The truth is every minute spent, watching, talking about or buying their crap supports the idea that it OK with the fans that the ownership puts a losing team on the ice.  Also the new reality is that the players of today are corporations unto themselves. If you could make double the overall money via endorsements in the US of A why would you subject yourself to the media circus in T.O. with no winning tradition to back up? Heart and soul from a player is asking too much these days when a half effort after getting that BIG contract signed is so financially lucrative."
896760,Old Ironmaker,2015-02-08 16:22:00,8243,"A professional is someone receiving compensation for a service that earns revenue for those that employ that individual.  The Leafs are doing their jobs, the place is full, every game. Job well done."

I enjoyed watching their high paced score a ton style, but on nights where their goalies were just average, they would lose."

But to start they need to change the atmosphere around the team and that means it needs new leadership. Trade Dion,Lupul, to start bring in more heart and soul guys like when they had Tucker and Domi.Reimer needs a change of scenery as does Kessel. If you dont burn it down you cant rebuild"

896624,muddler,2015-02-07 21:00:00,623,"I don't like the Leafs, period. But I do like a good hockey game. Often we only have a Leaf game to watch here, so I watch it. I don't care if Edmonton is playing Buffalo as long as the teams are playing as hard as they can, I'll watch. Mistakes happen and different skill level are always apparent , BUT I admire hard working players. I just don't see enough of that with the Leafs.  The first line should be the gem on any team. It sets the tone for the rest of the other lines. Not happening with Phil. I've grown tired of all the lame excuses. THERE IS NO EXCUSE FOR THE LACK OF A WORK ETHIC! When the 3rd and 4th lines are the class of the team there is something terribly wrong. At 10 million a season I'd be cleaning the toilets at the end of each game too.  It takes very little skill to check and play defensive hockey. It is a mental thing and  team culture that certain player simple demonstrate that it is beneath them. That type of culture becomes contagious.  The result is failure. I am not saying Kessel should have 100 hits a game but for goodness sakes how many times have I seen him skate backwards to get out of the way of an opposing player that is carrying the puck to the Leafs zone. A PeeWee player will try to check a player like that and yet the 10 million dollar man can't? Oh yeah, ""he's a sniper"". That is just crap. This is the NHL, anybody can be a snipe if they loaf around between the blue lines and wait for the ""breakout pass"".  That's the new NHL?  I love Boston and LA. They just grind you to death. Good old fashion hockey. They out work most teams, and that's why they win. They are NOT the best team offensively but everybody hates to play them. The Habs have a nice mixture of grit and talent, love watching them. You work both ways or you're gone. That's what the Leafs should be doing.  Fixing the Leafs is easy. Kick their butts. Carry your weigh or get left behind."
