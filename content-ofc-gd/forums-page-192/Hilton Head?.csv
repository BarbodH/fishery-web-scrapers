My uncle who's condo we are renting, and lives nearby, will be taking us out on a redfish charter... But, I was wondering if there was any shore fishing nearby that I'd be able to get into. Salt or Freshwater, I'll get myself a a permit for whichever seems best. Any ideas anyone?  Thanks for any advice."

897308,Locnar,2015-02-11 01:45:00,645,Thanks buddy! I shall check'r out. Shark fishing on the beach sounds like I'd need some extra heavy tackle. Would be pretty epic though.
