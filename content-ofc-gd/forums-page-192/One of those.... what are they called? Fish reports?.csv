897597,Acountdeleted,2015-02-12 02:34:00,2562,"So, as mentioned in the topic about the lack of fish reports, I don't write a lot of them because I don't tend to catch a lot of fish when I go out. The is especially true during the winter where, I read reports, I do research, I buy tons of lures and go to spots where there should be fish, and there are no fish.  Now, the entire winter hasn't been a bust. There have been some great trips, like the Crappie New years eve with Nick...... wait...... that sounds wrong....... the Crappie time I had with....... no, not much better. Anyways...... Or getting into a pile of perch with DynamicBear on Simcoe but those reports were already posted. Or there have been those times where I went to those lakes that I didn't actually go to with those people I didn't actually go with and catch those fish I didn't actually catch *wink* don't worry. They don't suspect a thing.  But for me, a report has to be something different. A new lake, A new species of fish, something worth sitting down and writing about.  So, back on topic. I honestly prefer ice fishing with buddies. It breaks up the slow parts of the day, stories are shared, games are played and even if there are no fish, it doesn't feel like a waste of a day, but a few times out of the year I just have to get out there on my own. There is something just so tranquil and peaceful about having an entire lake to yourself, not seeing another person the entire day.  The target today was a splake lake a little ways up North. I knew where the fish were, I had info and maps and tips and tricks...... and no fish to show for it. The biggest problem I have noticed this year is that, with the warm December and the pile of snow we got in January, a lot of lakes have become a slushy, mushy mess with 6 inches of slush topped off with an extra 6 inches of snow. Anyone who walks on this for more then 100 meters will tell you, it can seem like a death march. So I knew where the fish were, but it was exhausting getting out of the bay I lunched at. Forget a 2.5km walk down a desolate lake with gear.  So after fishing said lake in local bays, marking fish that clearly had no interest in my offering and feeling bewildered, I decided to head back towards the city. Looking at my watch and seeing it was only Noon, I wasn't done yet. I had to try somewhere else.  For those of you still reading who haven't fallen asleep due to the lack of fish porn (told you I didn't catch many fish) I have a love, hate relationship with lady Simcoe. Anytime I want to introduce someone to ice fishing, I take them for perch and they always have a blast, I almost always do as well. But I keep seeing reports of people pulling monster Lake Trout, Whitefish and perch out of her with which I have had no success.  I was only out for about 3 hours at a spot I had wanted to try for some time now but I was finally able to nab some fish. (I wish the story of catching the fish was better, but it was pretty standard. They hit, I reel, I sigh of relief and cry into the snow for a few minutes).     The OPP came around asking about Limits and licences. Good to see more enforcement for that kinda stuff. The best part is, after they figure out you have everything in order, they are the nicest guys in the world, talking about good lakes and spots, huts and gear..... I just wish they hadn't asked for my licence as I marked a massive laker picking off a school of herring underneath me. Ah well. I'll get that one another day.  Now excuse me while I try to find out how to pickle a herring.  "
897599,grizzlybri,2015-02-12 02:54:00,565,"nice report, and I only needed 2 coffees to get through it. I have the same feeling with Lady Simcoe and even once my ice fishing itch is satisfied, there will always be the pursue of fish.  Great report again and can't wait for our next trip out"
897600,Sinker,2015-02-12 02:55:00,8692,Maybe its your buddies who are the bad luck?? Lol  Thanks for sharing!  S.
897602,chris.brock,2015-02-12 03:19:00,4053,I would say that was a successful solo mission!  Good fish report.
897618,Moosebunk,2015-02-12 07:52:00,3970,"Your location says Edmonton so when you say you went a little north for the day of splaking ya kinda lost me.  But then you said OPP and I was like ohhhh, Edmonton Kentucky.  That was a ""little"" north then, to come all the way up to Ontario.  Good work for the travel dood!  lol"
897625,spincast,2015-02-12 10:09:00,3279,"A Charlie Brown fishing report - all that was missing was a ""Drat!"" when the OPP interrupted the greaser chasin'  thanks for sharing"
897631,Rod Caster,2015-02-12 12:19:00,5784,Loving the beard Jer!  Those herring look like gianet smelt. Look tasty
897638,Locnar,2015-02-12 13:08:00,645,Frggin right man! Looks like a decent day on the ice. I've tried many times for lakers on simcoe... skunked every damn time.

See, I thought that too, but DynamicBear and Chris K clean up when I'm not there. One lake we were one, I had to go for a pee off the ice just to get the fish to start hitting.  Your location says Edmonton so when you say you went a little north for the day of splaking ya kinda lost me.  But then you said OPP and I was like ohhhh, Edmonton Kentucky.  That was a ""little"" north then, to come all the way up to Ontario.  Good work for the travel dood!  lol  I changed my city when I moved out there. Was debating changing it when I moved back but hopefully it throws off people who prowel the forums just looking for lakes and hot spots without contributing. That being said, when I lived out there, I'd still fly back once or twice a year to go ice fishing.  Loving the beard Jer!  Those herring look like gianet smelt. Look tasty  Thanks Chad. I keep having to regrow it because I shave it for job interviews. Hopefully soon my 'playoff beard' will be able to grow massive.  This is NOT a fishing report, because no BURBOT where caught.  This is true! This trip was a total bust!!!"
897654,jimmer,2015-02-12 15:11:00,2730,Thanks or sharing. Any fish is great when ice fishing.
897783,Fisherpete,2015-02-12 23:44:00,1814,Very nice Jer! That laker has awesome markings!

The only time I haven't caught any fish this year (so far, knock on wood) is when it was just me and Jeremy,  so trust me its him lol, I say this now but He'll out fish me when it comes to bass season  great post and great looking fish"
