I only just managed to get one hole inside the shack done, either gonna have to get an extension for the auger extension or the farm jack to take it off the blocks, drill, and get them back under again….plenty of ice despite the mild winter.  The Ice Road is not exactly the fishing hotspot of the region, but the walleye are around, albeit mostly small ones. Great place to hang out with family and friends though!  Jack was really poorly that morning and I had a day off. By 10am Jack said he was bored, he made a miraculous recovery when I suggested the shack!  We took the skidoos down and had a blast enjoying all things iceshacky. Lunch was simple but fun, the shack was warm and we even had a a few missed bites and steady action for 45 minutes from 3pm. Finally landed one inside the shack, Jack got it and was all smiles!   "

I'm not that worried about speed as top whack is 8 mph, but its still fast enough to be worried about something hitting him or him losing control and hitting something else."
