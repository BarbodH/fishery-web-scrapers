Everything went perfect, well until a pike showed up that is, all was good fish were biting and even being landed, lots of herring and a few whitefish and perch in between, lots of fish were missed, I had a few pike rip me right off on the hookset, had a few whitefish spool me but other than that, it was a good time, with some good friends and hopefully will be repeated before the end of the season! Size 11 boot in the pic by the way, (for reference)."
