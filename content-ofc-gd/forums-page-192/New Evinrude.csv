The black parts are fixed, but the coloured side and top panels can be changed easily  since they're held on by a series of screws (look carefully and you can see them).  You'll notice this engine is mounted on an aluminum Armstrong bracket, which moves the engine 22 inches back of the transom. Holy cow does that ever do a lot to juice the boat's handling. The extra torque and leverage is incredible. The only down side is that you're more likely to tangle lines around it when trolling.  "

Blame your dealer for ripping you off at $65 a jug, it's $50 everywhere else. If you don't want to run XD100 you can change the ECU parameter to run XD50 and select from a variety of synthetics. A lot of warranty refusals stem from motors set to run on XD100 and customers cheaping out (or mis-advised) and running Amsoil etc. I had an Amsoil retailer tell me it was the same as XD100....it's not.

896166,RandyLinden,2015-02-05 14:06:00,40,"Hi I don't comment often but thought some clarification might help.  Contrary to North East Sharks opinion The new Etec's are far from junk and is why you see them on more and more new hulls. The new Evinrude 2 stroke technology is actually cleaner than the 4 strokes and provides comparable or even better fuel economy while delivering all round better performance. They are quiet (comparable to the same HP in a 4 stroke) don't require any oil changes and in my opinion on the larger HP models are less costly to operate.  As far as Ranger boats are concerned you can order any one of their boats with any brand of outboard you prefer. Ranger is not affiliated with or married to any one brand of outboard. There is no penalty or below wholesale credits etc. applied to the cost. The boats are typically ordered from a dealer that sells and services specific brands of engines and the customer can choose which brand and what HP model they want on their new boat.  I suspect that the shipment in the picture was headed up to Orleans boat World in Ottawa, but I'm not sure. Cheers Randy"
