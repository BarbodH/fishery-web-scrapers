897623,wormdunker,2015-02-12 09:09:00,1711,Your pics are awesome!  Thanx for posting.   Extra gear & lures will certainly bump the price up a bit.  That's OK - Now you have lifetime memories!
897390,MrSimon,2015-02-11 14:27:00,217,"In another thread someone asked for more fishing reports.  Considering this forum can get pretty grumpy sometimes, I figured that guy was right ..... this place needs more fishing reports.  I posted this on Walleye Central but don't know if I ever posted it here.  Due to the excellent advice from Chris Brock and Mike Borger, we took a trip last summer to Quantz Lake with Hearst Air.  In a nut shell, it was AWESOME!  Hearst air was a pleasure to deal with from start to finish.  Quantz lake was full of big pike and countless numbers of medium sized walleye.  The cabin and boats were great!!!!  This was the best fishing I've ever experienced.  The pike were shallow and hungry.  The walleye were literally everywhere.  We had great weather, no major injuries, good food, awesome friends .... all for about $1,800 per person, all in.  I'll let the pictures speak for themselves.   One box of tackle was more than enough for me.   No issues in the morning - smooth sailing all the way.    Great cabin at a great location on the lake.    All the comforts of home.    And there were pike .....                                     We caught a couple decent walleye, but mostly they were small to medium.  Endless numbers though.                 And last but not least .... some beautiful scenery.                                "

897404,solopaddler,2015-02-11 15:10:00,8605,"Seen it already but it's nice to see again.  As you well know I'm fishing Quantz myself this August, really looking forward to it!"

897409,4x4bassin,2015-02-11 15:28:00,1025,"Looks like a great place , thanks for sharing"
897414,chris.brock,2015-02-11 15:45:00,4053,"Damn, those fish and scenery pictures make me wish it was summer! .  That lake is a pike factory for sure. It's good to hear you had a great trip."
897437,darsky,2015-02-11 16:49:00,586,maybe I am wrong but isn't 1800.00 a lot for a fly in trip? It does look nice tho'
897439,solopaddler,2015-02-11 16:56:00,8605,"maybe I am wrong but isn't 1800.00 a lot for a fly in trip? It does look nice tho'  Price for a July-Sept trip week long trip to Quantz is $1095. That price would include food, drink, gas, motel, etc... You're right though that still seems high."
897443,manitoubass2,2015-02-11 17:05:00,11391,Maybe that included a flight and motels stays and gas to get to the flyout?  Wicked report!!!
897447,Musky or Specks,2015-02-11 17:11:00,2710,Nice report.
897466,can u fish,2015-02-11 18:05:00,326,Thanks for the report and awesome photos.
897471,crappieperchhunter,2015-02-11 18:13:00,2582,Awesome shots. Haven't done a fly in for years. Pictures like this get me thinking....  Thx for sharing.
897476,MrSimon,2015-02-11 18:21:00,217,"maybe I am wrong but isn't 1800.00 a lot for a fly in trip? It does look nice tho'  That is an all-in price that includes the fly-in (1,195 per for a 5 man group), taxes, outdoor card, license, lures, gear, food, beverages, fuel & food for a 2,200 mile round trip, night in a hotel, sat phone rental, tolls, bait, and tips.  I consider it a bargain."

897508,fisherman7,2015-02-11 21:05:00,325,"First time I was at Quantz, all the fish were in the south and just few in the north. Two years ago we went back and it was the exact opposite!"

897520,S.M.05,2015-02-11 22:25:00,145,"A couple cold ones, fresh walleye and a few buddies fishing on your own private lake. Looks like some good fishn..Gotta love fly-ins"

897540,misfish,2015-02-11 23:41:00,29133,"That was a nice ""make me wish I was fishing from my toon"" report.  Great pictures and some nice fish.  Ok,winter can be done now.LOL  Thanks for taking the time sir.  These are the sights I look forward to.  "
