896919,Old Ironmaker,2015-02-09 07:07:00,8243,"Have used my Shimano Bantam for about 30 plus years and have a Quantum that bit the bisquit after only 10 years. It's time to dig deep and cough up. It will be a Shimano. As all my spinning reels are Shimano and that brand has never, ever failed on me. I was set up with a Currado when I went out with Dan Columby last October and loved it. Smoothest cast and retrieve I have ever used in a baitcaster. I do not use a baitcaster much as I fish 99% of the time for Smallmouth on Erie and longlining here as well. And zero backlash that day, not a one and I'm no pro on a baitcaster.  It will be used for smallies and Northerns and Largemouth on my annual upper NY state trip. My budget is $200.00 CDN taxes in. My old one has paid for itself in over 30 years. I see the Currado 1 for $179.00 at Cabellas.  Feel free to advise please. As long as it's a Shimano.  "
896920,porkpie,2015-02-09 09:40:00,2521,"Curado, if not then Citica.  Good solid reels.  If you can find a slightly used Core , then snap it up.  The last used Core I bought cost me $215 shipped and cores are some of the nicest reels I've ever fished, even nicer when I put some boca bearings in, which I eventually do with all my casting reels.  Can't go wrong with a curado or a citica though!"
896939,OhioFisherman,2015-02-09 14:16:00,6623,"Just my opinion, it would be pretty hard to go wrong with a Curado."
896944,mattaw,2015-02-09 15:30:00,162,"The new curado I platform is a winner. If you look around you can probably find one a tad cheaper when sales come around, or such"
896976,HTHM,2015-02-09 18:29:00,4082,"TAke a trip to Woodstock, they have a very nice selection. While you are there take along all of your rods and reels, and have the pro match reel to rod. He really knows what works well together."
896980,bare foot wader,2015-02-09 18:36:00,1354,"just a heads up, my local Canadian tire had curado's on clearance....not sure which models as I didn't look too closely but noticed all the red flags in the glass case, maybe worth checking out"
896985,mattaw,2015-02-09 19:22:00,162,"just a heads up, my local Canadian tire had curado's on clearance....not sure which models as I didn't look too closely but noticed all the red flags in the glass case, maybe worth checking out  It wouldn't be the I as they are a new release, probably the Curado G. Stay far away from that though... not worth the money by a long shot!  edited."
896998,ecmilley,2015-02-09 21:19:00,2163,Curado is the benchmarknin the $200 class go for it. Any baitcaster i own that works well is shimano cant say much.good about abu or quantum
897012,mepps,2015-02-09 21:59:00,1301,Curado +1
897021,Old Ironmaker,2015-02-09 22:16:00,8243,"So it seems I am choosing the right stuff. Curado I it is, now to find a deal.  Thanks all,  JD"
897023,mattaw,2015-02-09 22:20:00,162,"So it seems I am choosing the right stuff. Curado I it is, now to find a deal.  Thanks all,  JD  I hate to say Bass Pro, but they have the reel trade in promo on right now, so if you can make it in with an old baitcaster or reel, you'd save a penny on it...  Hope that helps!"
897027,lew,2015-02-09 22:30:00,12766,"You won't go wrong with Shimano JD, good choice."
897028,Steve,2015-02-09 22:31:00,2075," It wouldn't be the I as they are a new release, probably the Curado E. Stay far away from that though... not worth the money by a long shot!  You mean the ""G"".  The ""E"" is still getting better reviews than the ""I""."
897031,Steve,2015-02-09 22:36:00,2075,edit:  nevermind.  lower 48 only.  (it was for a virtually brand new Curado 201E for $130)
897044,Bondar,2015-02-09 23:26:00,817,"I really like the Curado I so far, I got a great deal on ebay for it new in the box I think I paid $120 all in"
897047,Steve,2015-02-09 23:36:00,2075,"I've heard good things about the ""I"" as well.  The ""E"" was a good one.  The ""G"" was a failure.  The ""D"" was the best one to date.  The old ""B"" Super Free was quite good as well....retro Curado, lol."
897076,bow slayer,2015-02-10 01:01:00,1074,I have a curado 200 E7 and love it.......I also have a Calcutta 100TE DC and that is the best baitcast reel I have ever used.  Cant go wrong with a shimano. I also have a Revo SX that I cant complain about either.
897083,grt1,2015-02-10 01:42:00,638,"got one of the abu Garcia revo reels a couple years ago, with 10 bearings, it is so smooth. just love it. but I also have a shimano and I love it too, but the one I use for casting is the revo"
