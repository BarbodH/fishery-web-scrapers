896596,Terry,2015-02-07 18:15:00,14456,here is some video of the thing   
896597,BillM,2015-02-07 18:22:00,17367,I had no idea Red Green ice fished!!!
896598,kuhaman,2015-02-07 18:23:00,503,That is awesome man!! Great job!!
896603,2 tone z71,2015-02-07 18:44:00,1311,Wow ..that looks awesome ..love the big storage box ..that thing at the end thou woaahh lol
896604,misfish,2015-02-07 18:46:00,29133,"Ahhhhhh, I said to paint them didnt I?  SMACK. LOL   Guess it will be a couple of weeks before I get to try it."
896618,kickingfrog,2015-02-07 20:18:00,8333,That looks like it would be so much fun that i might forget to fish.
896621,muskymatt,2015-02-07 20:44:00,2608,That's pretty awesome.  Nice rig!
896630,Fisherman,2015-02-07 21:36:00,7201,"Have to ask, does the tag axle have any suspension or only the drive wheels?  Looks pretty good."
896631,misfish,2015-02-07 21:42:00,29133,The back wheels are supported by a shock and bracket mounted to the ATV. Look again at the walk around.
896633,Terry,2015-02-07 21:48:00,14456,and the center square tubing is spring loaded too  but really not a heck of a lot of suspension
896643,davey buoy,2015-02-07 22:11:00,5505,"Awesome job Terry,looks great!!!!!!!"
896647,misfish,2015-02-07 22:17:00,29133,"and the center square tubing is spring loaded too  but really not a heck of a lot of suspension  The back ""roller wheels"" are there to allow for more traction.(long track) For the use they are for,there is enough suspension. They are meant to float, not take punishment. IMO"
896648,Terry,2015-02-07 22:20:00,14456,yeah  the  back axle is held on with a hitch so full movement  like BrianB says
896666,Gerritt,2015-02-07 22:59:00,6129,"That's friggen cool man, it's different then what I thought at first I assumed the rear wheels were powered as well, which could easily be done with spocket and chain I would imagine....  Either way it is friggen cool! Keep us updated on its progress please.  G"
896678,Fisherman,2015-02-07 23:49:00,7201,"The back wheels are supported by a shock and bracket mounted to the ATV. Look again at the walk around. Ok, wasn't quite sure if that was a shock in the middle or a solid turnbuckle  to keep the rear tag extended."
896708,richyb,2015-02-08 01:54:00,774,Nice rig !!!  Did you buy the hitch a track or make one similar ?
896709,Terry,2015-02-08 02:07:00,14456,"they are out of business, but I bought the parts they had,  made or bought  the rest where I could"
896799,Joey,2015-02-08 19:42:00,9122,"So very innovative Terry, great job.   Looks like alot of fun!!  You could charge for rides at the Tyler event"
896802,Terry,2015-02-08 19:44:00,14456,"lol I am going to be away the next 2 weekends, so I am going to miss it"
896818,misfish,2015-02-08 20:13:00,29133,"I,ll have to sweet talk yer mrs,s into giving me the key while your away.  For the machine that is.LOL"
