897231,D.Sams,2015-02-10 21:29:00,8,"Good afternoon, everyone. New to the forum and thought I'd say hello before asking the question I have.  I'm a 28 year old gent, and spend nearly all of my free time outdoors either fishing, camping, hiking or some variation thereof. I grew up in Ontario and had a family cottage in the Huntsville area where I would spend summers.  Five years ago, an excellent job opportunity presented itself on the West coast, so I packed up shop and took it. The fishing here, saltwater especially, is incredible!  This summer (June 12th - 21st) I will be returning to Ontario to visit family and friends, mostly in the Burlington area. I'll have a 2 or 3 day stretch without any commitments and I'm hoping to get up North to get in a little fishing. I will have a car, but I will not have a boat. I don't have any particular species in mind, though traditionally I've enjoyed catching brook trout and walleye, as to me they taste the best.  Where would be a good, relatively remote place to get some good fishing/camping in, within 3-6 hours drive from Burlington?  I understand that people aren't generally too quick to divulge specific information regarding spots on the internet and I certainly respect that, so perhaps just a general area or pointers on where to start?  I'm a rather adventurous and capable guy and I've got a lot of backcountry, map and topo experience. And I'm certainly prepared to do my research here.  Looking forward to replies!  Thanks!"

If you are going to travel that far, at least improve your chances. So many lakes, and if walleye is your flavor and travelling doesnt seem to be an issue, any lake north of sudbury will give you more walleye than you can handle"

I'll certainly look into a boat rental, though I had initially planned to keep to shore fishing."

Thank you for the response, I appreciate it. It seems as though I may need to rent a boat in order to be as successful as I'd like to be."
897339,D.Sams,2015-02-11 03:53:00,8,"Arrowhead pp. May be just what your looking for. I've enjoyed my time in Provincial Parks before, thank you for the suggestion. The only thing I've noticed is that because of the high foot traffic they (at least in my experience) have seemed a little more ""fished out"" than more remote locations.  Have you fished in Arrowhead Provincial Park?  What was it like?"
897361,Freshtrax,2015-02-11 06:34:00,2215,The lakes are stocked with trout and the big east river is full of smallmouth.
