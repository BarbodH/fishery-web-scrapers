896369,TheTallPolak,2015-02-06 12:05:00,26,"Good morning everyone!  This is my first forum thread so to keep the story short....  This past weekend I was out fishing with my father out of Lefroy for perch! (Unfortunately no luck, But still beats a good day at work  ) Ice conditions were great with over 16"" of ice where we were setup. After our trip had concluded and I had offered to buy coffee from our local Timmies for the family (back in my home town of Mississauga) I had noticed that I had lost my Drivers License and Debit Cards! After frantically searching every inch and every pocket including my fathers, I had to admit to finally loosing my cards somewhere out on the lake.  As this happened on Sunday, the following day I filed for new cards, with the impression that the cards are swimming somewhere amongst the fish! But to my surprise, on Wednesday February 4th, a strange envelope had showed up in the mail! Assuming it may be work of my girlfriend for the upcoming Valentines, I opened it expecting to see hearts and kisses only to find a Silver Holiday Greetings Card!  Upon opening the card further, I read a delightful message from what I am assuming is another fellow angler and both of my cards attached!  I would just like to say a special thank you,  to whomever took the time to write up the message as well as mail me back my cards.  It is the Lake Simcoe community which allows for all anglers to have such a great Ice Fishing experience although the only thing they may catch is a cold!"

A little tip - For the past several years I have stored (laptop) & printed a hard copy called   ""cards in my wallet"". This document with card name, card # & contact phone number is useful in case you should misplace your wallet."

(drive with a photocopied version of a drivers lisence - if you misplace the original)"
