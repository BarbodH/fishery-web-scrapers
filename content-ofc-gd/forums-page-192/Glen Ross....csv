896911,Gerritt,2015-02-09 03:27:00,6129,Hit up a somewhat local fishing hole that has produced in the past... Today was not that day...  5 hours+ of fishing... 1 fish lol and not the target species... Ahhh well it was a good day out regardless spending some time with a good lifelong friend.  For those of you that don't know Glen Ross is located on the Trent just below lock #7  I didn't take too many pics well only one really.  Anyways here is the one measly fish for the day. Hopefully you guys did better then we did.  We tried everything.... And this sucker hit a 1/8oz jig tip with a small minnow.... Go figure..    G
896928,Rod Caster,2015-02-09 12:07:00,5784,Pound fer pound we were about tied for the day.... although I'll take an inland rainbown anyday over a pike haha.  Looks like you managed to stay warmer than I did
896929,Spiel,2015-02-09 12:08:00,9065,"Beats staying in. Looks like an eater, did you put the blade to it?"
896932,Gerritt,2015-02-09 13:02:00,6129,It would have been the perfect size for the table. However I let swim.  G
