896432,Mister G,2015-02-06 18:03:00,1429,"When I'm perch fishing and just anchored I have 2 Lowrance LMS 520c units going, VHF radio, live well on a auto timer going, am/fm radio going and a auto bilge pump going because da boats leaks a bit now and then. You sit there for 5-8 hours and it adds up. Then I head back a whopping 1.3 miles back to the launch and my starting battery never gets recharged even though my E-Tech motor has a GREAT charging system."
896433,Mister G,2015-02-06 18:04:00,1429,That reminds me... I should put the charger on my starter to top it up...  Been sitting outside since Christmas... GOOD LUCK...with these conditions I hope all is well.
896902,SuperDave,2015-02-09 03:05:00,204,Thanks for all the input guys. Ended up buying a Promariner 2 bank 12Amp charger. My fishing buddy has this one and has had no issues with it.
896913,Old Ironmaker,2015-02-09 03:46:00,8243,I never had need to charge my starter battery. Until the first time out with the new kicker. My electronics killed the battery. That electric start kicker paid for itself to bring us in 8 miles out. But if I didn't have the kicker I wouldn't kill the start battery. Had just enough to start the 15HP kicker. Something I need to address for this year. I don't want to kill the battery again. I  might just buy a booster pack. Draining batteries kill them.
896923,Mister G,2015-02-09 11:43:00,1429,"Old Iron, you are starting to see the light......a on-board charger also hooked up to the starting motor is really the way to go to get the most out of your battery because it maintains it while it not in use.  Another good tip is a battery tender for those who have ATV because how long they sometimes sit without being used. This charger is also equal to our boat on-board chargers because it initialization, bulk charge, absorption mode, float mode. I have this one from Cabela's.  http://www.cabelas.com/product/Battery-Tenderreg/734156.uts?Ntk=AllProducts&searchPath=%2Fcatalog%2Fsearch%2F%3FN%3D%26Ntk%3DAllProducts%26Ntt%3Dbattery%2Bcharger%26Ntx%3Dmode%252Bmatchallpartial%26WTz_l%3DHeader%25253BSearch-All%2BProducts%26form_state%3DsearchForm%26recordsPerPage%3D80%26search%3Dbattery%2Bcharger%26searchTypeByFilter%3DAllProducts%26x%3D0%26y%3D0&Ntt=battery+charger&WTz_l=Header%253BSearch-All+Products"

896933,Gerry,2015-02-09 13:29:00,257,"Hooking up a charger to a cranking (main) battery is a good idea. As Lew stated, you can leave your batteries in the boat all winter. Also, if you park your boat for extended periods, the on-board computer on the main engine draws constant power, as does your GPS antenna. And, if you happen to leave a light on in the boat, this can draw the cranking power below which is needed to fire up those bigger motors. If you mkae short runs, the alternator might not have enough running time to replace the charge that you used up with electronis, downriggers, etc. A car is the same."
896936,Mister G,2015-02-09 13:49:00,1429,"I'm another that's never seen a need for hooking a charger to the cranking battery. Actually old Lew has spoken against hooking up a on-board charger to the cranking / main battery. However, a few others including myself have posted that it really is a good idea.  I never thought of the on-board computer systems now prevalent in today's modern outboards that could be a battery drain......good tip.  I have a am/fm radio on-board that like a car radio has digital clock display that is ALWAYS on and over time can draw the battery down. And of course who knows if you have a battery drain/short somewhere in your boat's electrical system.  As far a GPS antennas, my LMS 520c units work off the round disk antenna that Lowrance recommended to be installed with a separate on/off switch that I did install. This not only protects the battery but also protects the antenna from burning out because it's always on. I believe that was Lowrance's main concern because older units the 19c did not mention running a separate switch and may have caused these antennas to fail prematurely. Now almost all of the new units on the market have built in antennas that I'm sure are not activated when the unit is shut down."
896946,lew,2015-02-09 15:37:00,12766,"Actually old Lew has spoken  Not old, just very experienced"
896949,Mister G,2015-02-09 15:42:00,1429," Not old, just very experienced When I looked up ""very experienced"" it did not mention you........however when I looked up ""OLD"" your picture came up....LOL....JK"
896054,SuperDave,2015-02-04 21:33:00,204,"I want to purchase an on board battery charger. It will be for my Terrova 80lb. thrust 24V trolling motor. There seem to be many out there, with either 2 or 3 banks and also different Amps from 8 to 20. Could someone shed some light on this for me?  Thanks,  Dave  "
896058,Tom McCutcheon,2015-02-04 21:53:00,627,"Hey Dave....The Minn Kota 2 bank charger Mike has on his boat has worked well for the last 7 years. I can't tell you whether it's 8 or 20 amps or somewhere in between, but it will fully charge the two deep cycle batteries overnight. Now that I've said that, it will act up this season....."
896061,Terry,2015-02-04 22:01:00,14456,"you need one bank per battery , so 24v system 2 banks  you need to know if its 8 amps per bank or 20 amps per bank or total amps   if total that would give you 4 amps or 10 amps  the more amps the quicker they recharge"
896082,landry,2015-02-04 23:22:00,1005,I did a lot of research. The Minn Kota get good stability and reliability reviews. That's what I went with a year ago. 2 bank.
896112,porkpie,2015-02-05 01:21:00,2521,"Good question, I've been trying to decide what kind of charger to put in your old boat lol."
896123,sofabed,2015-02-05 02:17:00,119,I have a 2 bank Minkota on my boat. It stopped working with a couple of weeks left on warranty last summer. They replaced it without any questions asked. Great service.
896124,Paudash,2015-02-05 02:21:00,273,"watch the warranties on these, I have found they last 2 years or 10 years not much in between lots of good information on this sight if you do a search  I found an older model 3 bank charger at Canadian tire last year on clearance that came with a five year warranty, everything else I could find had 1 or 2 years"
896131,chimpboy_to,2015-02-05 03:21:00,27,"I have the same trolling motor and picked up a Dual pro recreational 2 bank charger for it, never any problems, does a great job to charge and pretty reasonable."
896149,fish_fishburn,2015-02-05 10:48:00,1311,Dual Pro 10 amp. mine is 19 yrs old and no issues
896150,G.mech,2015-02-05 11:13:00,830,You need one bank for each trolling battery plus one for the starting battery to charge and maintain it too....plug it in and forget it.   You can purchase cable extension kits for the one at the stern depending on which unit you decide on.  5A per bank (15A total) will charge your batteries overnight especially with the higher end models that self regulate.
896163,Lape0019,2015-02-05 13:40:00,647,I have the mk330. It's gotta be close to 8 years old as I bought it used. It charges my deep cycles and cranking battery in less that 5 hours after a heavy day on the water.  The cranking battery is usually charged within an hour but the deep cycles take a little longer because they don't get any charge from the main motor. All of the ones in the market today seem to be pretty smart and you don't have to play around with setting for wet or AGM batteries. You just have to make sure the charger you but is suitable for the battery you are using.
896198,Terry,2015-02-05 16:44:00,14456,I have never had the need to charge my starting battery. Unless close to the se price I would not spend the extra money on a third bank.  Unless your charging system on your motor is crap  But then I would spend the extra money on fixing it. Imo
896200,BillM,2015-02-05 16:52:00,17367,"I run a Guest 2 bank on our Lund after multiple recommendations from a few guys on here.    Great charger, no problems yet and it's plugged in all winter!"
896245,Pigeontroller,2015-02-05 22:45:00,2793,I don't understand the need to have your cranking battery hooked to the onboard charger? Isn't that what your alternator does?

896258,G.mech,2015-02-06 00:06:00,830,"I don't understand the need to have your cranking battery hooked to the onboard charger? Isn't that what your alternator does? If you leave your boat parked for long periods or leave the batteries in during winter storage it's nice to know the cranking battery is being taken care of.  It's the most important one on the boat in my mind.  The added cost for the third bank isn't significant really but like you guys suggest, it's not a 'must have' I guess."
896259,Terry,2015-02-06 00:08:00,14456,"I  take all my batteries out of my boat for the winter, my boat is stored for the winter and no electricity there. but I have always removed them"
896266,Lape0019,2015-02-06 00:20:00,647,"It's not needed but if you use your electronics often and do not make long charges, your cranking battery may never get fully charged. I prefer to just be careful and charge all three. I got a great deal in mine so I couldn't resist."
896271,workwear,2015-02-06 00:30:00,592,make sure when installing it ...you install it in a dry place on yer boat....

896422,Mister G,2015-02-06 17:17:00,1429,I have a Cabela's 2 bank charger.......the first one I had 4.5 years and it stopped working. Cabela's replaced it free of charge......the replacement is about 7-8 old now and it's the cats meow IMHO. And it's about half the price of some of these on-board chargers.

Imo I would have to disagree with you because nowadays we have sooooo many things running off that starting battery.........HOWEVER, that's not the only reason. I keep my batteries hooked up ALL winter long because I have a on-board charger that maintains those batteries all winter. I believe all the newer on-board chargers are smart chargers and you want them hooked up whenever you are not fishing."
896427,Terry,2015-02-06 17:38:00,14456,"I have never needed to charge a starting battery on a boat with proper charging system and I don't think theres a toy that uses power that I don't have on my boat (LOL) including downriggers, with   my kicker at the lowest speed I can go,it keeps it fully charged  I don't have power hydraulic steering .....which can be a killer  and I charge once them  in the middle of the winter , only a battery that is put away not fully charged or one that is on it's way out will freeze"
