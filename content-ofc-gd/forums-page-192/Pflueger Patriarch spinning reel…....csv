896493,Billy - Curtiss,2015-02-07 00:11:00,241,I just picked up one of these bad boys at the Toronto Sportsmen's Show yesterday.  I'm sitting here about to set it up and the arbor has what appears to be a clear sheath and I cannot tell if I should take this off or just put the line on top of that.  Any help that anybody could provide me with on this would be greatly appreciated.
896499,esoxansteel,2015-02-07 01:02:00,1307,"depends what size it is and what your fishing for, if your fishing for species that do not pull lots of line, use the arbour to save line, if your fishing flor Chinooks, Carp, Steelhead etc remove the arbour you will need the extra line"

896966,Sour_Squirrel,2015-02-09 17:26:00,196,Excellent reel.   I have a 9530. As long as you take care of the reel (clean and lube) it should last for years. Super smooth and lightweight.   Looks nice too.....
896977,bare foot wader,2015-02-09 18:29:00,1354,"it is light and smooth, but I found it didn't stand up over time, Mike highlighted those issues...it also did not survive being dropped, where as all my other reels have handled the occasional drop without worry  regarding the spool sheath, I would take it off, extra line never hurt anybody, especially if it's an all purpose reel"
896981,Steve,2015-02-09 18:37:00,2075,"The Pflueger President and Patriarch are a tackle retailers dream.  they are light and smooth in the shop.  and most anglers who buy them don't use them very much.  those that do fish a lot, like mike, quickly see the quality issues."
