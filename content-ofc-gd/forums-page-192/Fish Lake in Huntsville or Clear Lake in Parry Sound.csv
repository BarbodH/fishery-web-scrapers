897410,fisher,2015-02-11 15:30:00,451,Anyone fish either of these lakes?  You know how hard it is to search google for a lake called fish lake or clear lake?!!  I get results that there are fish in any lake and that the water is clear.  Any help on species and generally how the fishing is on these lake would help in my search for a place to rent this summer  thanks
