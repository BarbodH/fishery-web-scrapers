986314,MistyHollow,2016-11-15 23:34:00,21,Looking for a helping hand from forum members. I have four Venturer Scouts that would like to aquire their Pleasure Craft Operators Cards. I would like to obtain copies of the Basic Boating Safety Course Study Guide by The Navigators. As these books are around $22 dollars apiece  I am hoping that there maybe some forum members that have copies collecting dust  that would be willing to donate them to the boys.  The plan is for the boys to get their cards and then using a couple of my boats to do a river trip camping and fishing for a couple of nights.  Thanks to anyone that can help out.  Dan

986346,MistyHollow,2016-11-16 11:17:00,21,"OhioFisherman, the library has one copy, that I have borrowed to get them started. I am hoping to find 4 copies so each has one to study from.  Thanks for the suggestion, Dan"

986401,MistyHollow,2016-11-16 17:44:00,21,I am trying to get it in book form so the boys can do it as a group at the Scout hall. The Coast Guard Safe Boating Guide would be welcomed aswell.  Dan
