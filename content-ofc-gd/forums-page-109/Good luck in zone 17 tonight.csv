986307,Dutch01,2016-11-15 22:33:00,1431,I'm sitting beside my favorite Kawartha lake right now. So far only about a 5# pike but it's just getting dark. Good luck to whoever else is out there fishing right now.
986308,huzzsaba,2016-11-15 22:48:00,884,Wish I could drive out that far.  Good luck to you guys!  I will be checking out other zones after today where walleye are still open.
986327,captpierre,2016-11-16 01:32:00,2521,Should have great visibility with that moon. Go gettum.
986329,GBW,2016-11-16 01:34:00,8460,Wishing I was able to join ya but this working evenings/nights kind of puts a damper on that.  Good luck!!
986342,Dutch01,2016-11-16 08:07:00,1431,"Slow night... Hit two spots, got one 14"" walleye after the pike. It was still good to be out.  Now I'm dreaming of early ice!"
986343,GBW,2016-11-16 09:09:00,8460,Now I'm dreaming of early ice! my dream too!

986360,AKRISONER,2016-11-16 14:28:00,5558,man...i kinda am sitting in anticipation of ice season...is that wrong?
986363,Dutch01,2016-11-16 14:45:00,1431,"Canal, Mitchell, Balsam, and I've heard of a few being caught in Rice too."
986366,Tom McCutcheon,2016-11-16 15:32:00,627,"Canal, Mitchell, Balsam, and I've heard of a few being caught in Rice too.  All of the above as well as the Ottonabee River, Little Lake, Cameron and Sturgeon Lakes."
986370,captpierre,2016-11-16 15:44:00,2521,"Tom, are they confirmed in Sturgeon? ?????"
986372,Dutch01,2016-11-16 15:59:00,1431,"If they aren't yet, it's only a matter of time I'd say."
986373,DanD,2016-11-16 16:17:00,2223,man...i kinda am sitting in anticipation of ice season...is that wrong?  Not wrong but don't hold your breath.  
986374,Sterling,2016-11-16 16:26:00,477,DanD that is so cool...
986404,Tom McCutcheon,2016-11-16 18:19:00,627,"Tom, are they confirmed in Sturgeon?   Sorry to say, but the answer is yes."
986644,Old Ironmaker,2016-11-19 05:25:00,8243,"Dan, we haven't had any ice here on Erie for 2 years. The 2 bad years before that were the first ice we had for years. The water was so cold the Perch were in 30 feet of water. Couldn't get to them that far out. The pressure cracks looked like mountain ranges and the pack ice on the shoreline was over 15 feet high in most places for a mile out. Most outfitters in Long Point Bay have packed the business in. Nipissing for me this January. First time on the ice in 12 years. I can't wait, I can't believe I said that.  edit: only FishFarmer went that far out."

Did I hear my name mentioned   Lets hope St. Williams freezes over good this year. Not putting the boat away Johnny till some time in Dec."
986647,Tjames09,2016-11-19 11:44:00,664," Sorry to say, but the answer is yes.   Hmm never seen a Pike on Sturgeon yet. What part of the lake has Pike, the north end by Fenelon Falls?"
986692,Tom McCutcheon,2016-11-19 20:56:00,627,"  Hmm never seen a Pike on Sturgeon yet. What part of the lake has Pike, the north end by Fenelon Falls?  Not sure where it was caught, but I believe it was closer to Fenelon Falls. Which also makes sense. It probably migrated through from Cameron. Having said that, it may have been anywhere on Sturgeon. I have heard, but have no confirmation of Pike in Scugog."
986694,ecmilley,2016-11-19 21:40:00,2163,live on sturgeon put lots of hours in on sturgeon lots of bass tourneys on sturgeon can am walleye tourney on sturgeon no pike caught heard the same doomsday that the pike are there but there no established in Cameron or tri lakes no way to be estabilised  in sturgeon or scugog. you do catch one kill it
986695,Tom McCutcheon,2016-11-19 22:08:00,627,"Good thoughts, but please make sure that what you are killing and keeping is a Pike. Juvenile Muskies and Hybrids look a lot like a Pike. A lot of casual anglers still don't know what they are looking for to distinguish a Muskie from a Pike, let alone at the juvenile stage. Seasoned anglers like yourself and other tournament anglers, have a much better idea regarding fin shape, patterns and submandibular pore count. Myself, I fish mainly for Muskies except in the hot dog days of summer when the water temps get above77-80 deg., then I will go after walleye and bass."
