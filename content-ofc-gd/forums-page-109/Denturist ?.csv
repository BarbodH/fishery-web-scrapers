986383,Beans,2016-11-16 16:52:00,3339,Anyone know a good '' bootleg '' denturist ?  I had a complete upper denture made back in the early 70s by a legitimate dentist at Broadview and Gerrard for $75. after I lost mine swimming in the Otonabee River in Peterborough...  Today they want $2000 to $3000 for an upper and lower partial for my wife...  I too would like to have my lower partial made into a full denture if that is possible but at my age (80) I avoid long term investments so it looks like I will have to let my dentist keep getting rich off the four lower teeth I have...  Feel free to PM me...

986391,Mister G,2016-11-16 17:07:00,1429,Have you tried to carve them out of wood............LOL....JK  I know when I was in college I knew this girl that made them for dentist.....they would bring in the impressions and she would make them from there........the dentist cost $35........the patient cost $350.  Good Luck and I hope you score on some reasonable priced teeth.
986394,DanD,2016-11-16 17:13:00,2223,Maybe check the dental schools/universities? My brother in-law got complete uppers done for the cost of the material. Mind you it's students performing the work; but they are well supervised.  Dan.
986407,Beans,2016-11-16 18:46:00,3339,Thanks guys...I was wondering about a denturist school but don't know of any in the Lindsay/P'Boro area...  Anybody ???

986419,Old Ironmaker,2016-11-16 19:32:00,8243,"I bet Big Cliff can whittle you some. Having lost all medical benefits I only recently became aware of costs, I never realized how expensive it is. I went into see my Dentist as I am having pain in an upper Molar. When she came into the room I asked how much the exam would cost? It depends she said. I reached in my pocket and said ""Give me 50 bucks worth"". It was $105.00 for a 15 minute exam and 3 Xrays!!!!!! If it bothers me the tooth is coming out. After root canals, crown put on etc. they usually have to come out anyway. That's been my experience anyway."
986499,crappieperchhunter,2016-11-17 18:37:00,2582,Beans check into Durham college here in Oshawa.  I don't know about what your asking...but I do know a few people who go there for regular dental checkups/teeth cleaning etc.  Good practice for the students.  Worth checking into.
