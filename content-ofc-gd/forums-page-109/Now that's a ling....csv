986487,dave524,2016-11-17 14:41:00,4508,"This dood(and his brother) sure know fishing!  A normal ling around here is about 2lbs  I'll say, bothers, world record and Lake Dief  kinda set off a deja vu moment in my brain, yep same lake and brothers.  https://www.wired.com/2009/09/biotechfishing/"
986488,manitoubass2,2016-11-17 15:08:00,11391,"Also the guys from the ""uncut angling"" challenge tourny or whatever it was called"
986489,Acountdeleted,2016-11-17 15:27:00,2562,So cool! What a massive fish.  Can't wait to target them through the ice. I haven't eaten Ling in years.
986491,manitoubass2,2016-11-17 15:59:00,11391,Thats the only way I can actually catch them???  Nightime on the ice and its fish after fish  Ive only caught one in the daytime and its my pb at just under 5lbs
986492,DanD,2016-11-17 16:00:00,2223,"The first Ling that I caught, I almost lost it at the hole; expecting a pickerel and then seeing that ugly thing. My buddy said it looked like I reset the hook again; but not just with the fishing rod, my whole body as I jumped back away from it. LOL Slug-shot the poor bugger three feet into the air.  Dan."
986494,manitoubass2,2016-11-17 16:07:00,11391," Thats reminds me about 6 years back, I took a buddy ice fishing for his first time. He likes to fish but I wouldnt call him experienced.  His first fish that night was about a 3lb ling and ive never seen someone so scared of a fish.  Im telling him as I laugh, just unhook the thing and throw it on the ice.  To which he squirms and tries to reply as its wrapping around his forearm.  Hes so freaked.  Why throw it on the ice? Do we just kill these evil things?  Nah man were gonna eat it.  He almost pukes in his mouth hahaha.  We got off the ice about 6am, with limit of walleye and ling. I unhooked the rest he caught lol  Get home to some cold beers as I prep the fish  His first bite looks like hes about to taste alien brains. Second and 3rd bite he gets it  Ok, these fish are creepy but I can see why you keep them  Now he hits me up at least once every ice season for a ling fish???"
986495,BassMan11,2016-11-17 16:16:00,583,"Also the guys from the ""uncut angling"" challenge tourny or whatever it was called 39 hours. These guys catch some big fish."
986496,Joeytier,2016-11-17 17:01:00,3990,"Funny how the ling was caught during the day, and the rainbow after dark...  This happened 6 yrs ago btw  The ling bite is just starting up here for the winter."
986509,netminder,2016-11-17 21:05:00,514,Even if this is 6 years old looks like Diefenbaker might be a bucket list lake. Some bigguns in there for sure.
986512,DRIFTER_016,2016-11-17 21:56:00,10439,Thats the only way I can actually catch them  Nightime on the ice and its fish after fish  Ive only caught one in the daytime and its my pb at just under 5lbs  There are other ways to get em. We get them in our nets during the open water season.
986516,SirCranksalot,2016-11-17 23:51:00,3291,Now that's one massive burp-up!!!
986523,BillM,2016-11-18 01:48:00,17367,Imagine if he didn't hold it 3ft out from his body.
986528,manitoubass2,2016-11-18 02:58:00,11391,"I did, and its still a record?"
986608,Joeytier,2016-11-18 23:16:00,3990,
986697,ecmilley,2016-11-19 22:45:00,2163,yup boil them then fry the chunks poor mans lobster
986701,manitoubass2,2016-11-19 23:45:00,11391,I like it better. Plus its cheaper and alot more meat than a lobster
986730,Joeytier,2016-11-20 03:58:00,3990,"I fry them the same way as I do walleye or perch, turns out excellent!"
