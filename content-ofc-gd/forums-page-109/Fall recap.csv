987559,Joeytier,2016-11-30 22:58:00,3990,"Awesome fish! Could that first pic be of a splake? I'm not very good with my fish ID and have never caught a splake before but just curious...... Ive had a couple people bring it up, it does look splakey because of the spawning colours, but it is a laker!  Thx"
986774,Joeytier,2016-11-20 16:39:00,3990,"Here are some pics from my fall fishing adventures scattered around the various stocked lakes in my area. Small lakes will likely be skimmed over this week, so I think my next trip will be of the hardwater variety!Lakers...Didnt spend too much time on them as there is only one yr-round laker lake in my area but it produced some real nice ones for me this year. They were post-spawn and voracious!Rainbows...the inland bows have been a struggle for me to catch with any consistency but I believe Im starting to get them dialed in relatively well. Post turnover in the fall seems to be the hot time of year for them.Splake...My last two trips were targeting splake. No big fish, but the numbers were off the charts! 35-ish fish over 2 trips, trolling and casting in shallow water.Didnt make time for brookies this Oct/Nov but they will be priority once the lakes firm up!"
