987402,aplumma,2016-11-28 19:22:00,6896,Wow that is a pig of a fish.   Art
987405,Fang,2016-11-28 20:21:00,1330,I know it's Alaska but did you catch the fact that someone was actually ice fishing on Nov 14th I cut my grass that weekend.  plus is that a zamboni to the right?

Not Alaska. It's quite normal for us to have fishable ice here in Yellowknife by the beginning of November. Up North where this was caught they are on the ice in October.

987413,irishfield,2016-11-28 21:27:00,26272,Great place to store gas.. right beside the furnace!
987417,dave524,2016-11-28 22:17:00,4508,"Great place to store gas.. right beside the furnace!  The furnace probably is an oil burner and that is what is inside the jugs. As a kid we heated with an oil burning heater , it was in the livingroom and you filled a tank on the back with a galvanized watering can."

987425,kickingfrog,2016-11-28 23:28:00,8333,So does everybody up there drive a zamboni?
987427,DRIFTER_016,2016-11-28 23:39:00,10439,So does everybody up there drive a zamboni?  Of course!!! It's how we get to work EH!!!
987428,G.mech,2016-11-28 23:51:00,830,So does everybody up there drive a zamboni?  He was trolling on it when he got the burbot.....it's kind of like the photo beside the boat at the ramp that we do only NWT style.
987431,Moosebunk,2016-11-29 01:35:00,3970,Is that the heart of Great Bear Dave?
987432,DRIFTER_016,2016-11-29 01:40:00,10439,Is that the heart of Great Bear Dave?  North West of there. Closer to the Yukon and Inuvik. About 700kms or so NW of Bear on the Peel Channel of the Mackenzie River.
987434,Moosebunk,2016-11-29 01:42:00,3970,Had read somewhere that the heart of Bear isn't a laker.. but a giant ling instead. Maybe it swam the Mackenzie.
987435,npt1,2016-11-29 01:44:00,220,"As  Dave524 said,  we poured furnace oil right into the rear tank of the heater that was inside the house. My Dad showed me how to get the fuel from the 3 X  45 gallon drums that we had outside in the backyard, decant into 2.5 gallon containers and then bring them INTO the house to be ready for use. Stored them in the pantry off of dining room, and yes they were full of fuel. Those were ""the good old days"".. lol."
987436,EC1,2016-11-29 01:46:00,930,Wow new record! The burbot brothers are probably going to try and reclaim their record this year  Googled Aklavik and holy crap that's far and there are so many water bodies there. lol
