986961,Dutch01,2016-11-21 21:58:00,1431,"That looks awesome!  Do you hook the 'ducer to the bottom of the straps? I also have an ice 'ducer, I'll play around and see what works.  That's the one thing that sucks about buying toys out of season, you can't play with them. Well I suppose I could but that would be dang cold...."

Just hang it off the side.  Waters not that cold yet. Hell, we floated out on simcoe after ice out. Now that was cold."
987015,AKRISONER,2016-11-22 14:14:00,5558,frig i wish i coulda found one...perfect for fly fishing rivers ughhh

987030,Dutch01,2016-11-22 16:11:00,1431,I don't fly fish but I will be hitting some rivers nonetheless.
987117,AKRISONER,2016-11-23 17:53:00,5558,"to further add to the deals, the fam just grabbed an 8 inch jiffy 4 stroke auger for the cottage for 316.  not too shabby at all canadian tire, not too shabby."
987119,Dutch01,2016-11-23 18:19:00,1431,Good stuff! I used a manual auger once. Once. Then ice went and got my gas auger. Never go back....
987120,Moosebunk,2016-11-23 19:12:00,3970,That is a score. I'm wondering if there's any left around here now?  Just to have a second one at that price would be mint!
987123,AKRISONER,2016-11-23 19:24:00,5558,"That is a score. I'm wondering if there's any left around here now?  Just to have a second one at that price would be mint!  As far as I could see there was only one in stock in all of toronto....im just praying it wasnt a system glitch! I paid for it online and am going to pick it up this evening, we shall see if its the real deal!"
987127,Dutch01,2016-11-23 20:31:00,1431,"There's an Eskimo Shark in Richmond Hill that's marked down from 599 to 389  Same one in Maple (AISLE w/o), 299$  There's still a few deals to be had"

987135,misfish,2016-11-23 21:51:00,29133,Good stuff! I used a manual auger once. Once. Then ice went and got my gas auger. Never go back....  I have been using a manul auger the last 3 years. No problem at all.
987136,porkpie,2016-11-23 22:12:00,2521,"If anyone wants a Jiffy, they have one in stock online at the Fergus store.  3hp STX for $265 or something like that. I am auger rich or I would've jumped on it.  If someone is set on having it, but coming from a long way, I'll store it until you can pick up."
987140,GBW,2016-11-24 01:15:00,8460,"in today's mail I got a 4 day flyer and they have the Rapala 8"" 33cc Cyclone on sale for $349 (reg $549)"

987194,Sinker,2016-11-25 16:09:00,8692,"I guess that depends what you consider tough. I have been using a hand auger for 30 years. I'm usually set up and fishing before my buddies with gas augers. I have a jiffy as well, but I only use it when the ice is over 15 or so inches, or if I'm with a big group and have the only auger. Drilling 20 holes with a good hand auger is no big deal, really. And I don't use a drill adapter like some guys do...lol. Its not uncommon for me to go perching and drill well over 30 holes with my fin bor 3 to find them. No big deal.  S."

Here she is at home:    I'm excited to try it out next spring.  Canadian Tire now has their in store clearance inventory online. I also got 50% off a new bbq today!  I had to go to two stores but well worth it.  Happy shopping! (Hint: check a few local stores, each store has different pricing)."
986822,misfish,2016-11-20 21:30:00,29133,"Well let me be the first to say, you SCORED.  This was my first float boat. I loved it.  You will need a set of flippers now.  Then comes the mods to add a finder.  Then comes the, this is good, but now I want something bigger.  Then you are now into a toon.  More mods to be had.  Enjoy Dutch."
986824,Dutch01,2016-11-20 21:34:00,1431,I can see it already - I saved on the float but I'll spend it all back and more on mods/upgrades.  Hmmmm....I've already got a portable finder...... and so it begins!
986826,Fisherpete,2016-11-20 21:37:00,1814,Sweet find! I've been tempted to grab one of those and have carp take me for a tow at the cottage

986831,Old Ironmaker,2016-11-20 21:54:00,8243,Score? Ya think? The air to fill it costs 70 bucks. Happy treading.

986837,GBW,2016-11-20 22:09:00,8460,sonar's and allmost all summer fishing items are being cleared out so they don't have to 'pay to hold them'
986838,porkpie,2016-11-20 22:16:00,2521,"Buddy and I bought 2 helix 5 sonar/GPS for $234 plus tax each.  Will make a nice upgrade to the 385 I use for ice fishing.  Almost had a 55lb thrust Minn Kota I pilot unit for $550 plus tax.  Was going to buy as a backup, I just couldn't resist the price.  The order went through but they cancelled it after spending 40 minutes searching for the unit.  Spoke to them on the phone and they stated it appeared to be ghost inventory, too bad, that would've been the deal of the century.  I did also get a new float coat for $100."

986845,porkpie,2016-11-20 22:57:00,2521,"There's only 2 left now.  Act fast on a screaming deal.  I was tempted to be a jerk and buy all 3 and resell, but there are only so many hours in the day lol.  Thanks for the tip!"

986848,Dutch01,2016-11-20 23:09:00,1431,"That's a steal right there.  Both items I bought today were not out on the shelves. The BBQ was put away ""upstairs"", thank you to the kids who spent 20 minutes finding it for me.  The float tube was actually at the bottom of a shrink wrapped skid being wheeled into the back. I hollered at the kids to stop. He said he just built the skid and wrapped it, I told him ""looks like you'll be doing it twice""."
986850,misfish,2016-11-20 23:17:00,29133,"I have my  finder holder that I made Dutch. Rotates 180 deg. No use to me now. Yours if you want it. Just straps on with a 1"" quick strap."

986865,manitoubass2,2016-11-21 01:27:00,11391,"Doh!!!! I was just there???? Ughhh  I got the wife a winter jacket retail $179 on sale for $49. And new work bibs, reg. $179 on sale for $74  I shoulda looked around more, woulda bought this in a heartbeat"
986866,GBW,2016-11-21 01:32:00,8460,But each store is different Rick for deals.  It's all based on clearing out stock to not have to wrap it up for 6 months or so
