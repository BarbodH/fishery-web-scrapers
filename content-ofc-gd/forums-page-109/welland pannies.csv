The daughter and I spent 4 hours along the river hitting on schools of bluegills and pumpkinseeds. They did not want artificial minnows this time. They wanted good old fashioned  dew worms. There wasn't another soul around either.

987187,crappieperchhunter,2016-11-25 10:37:00,2582,"Good to hear Bruce. A buddy who is recently addicted to Gills has been just murdering them on Stony this fall.  Since I'm never in Caygeon in the fall I still haven't experienced a fall fish for gills. Really looking forward to it some day. Especially the ""not another soul around "" thing. One of my fav  things about fall fishing.  Enjoy your fish fry."
