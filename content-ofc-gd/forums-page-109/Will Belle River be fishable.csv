986292,Old Ironmaker,2016-11-15 20:06:00,8243,Living on the water can be frustrating. All I need to do is drive the 15 minutes to the slip and the wind is so bad nobody in their right mind would go out in it.  Good luck you guys.
986296,Musky Plug,2016-11-15 21:01:00,398,"Went yesterday, launched out of the belle river, was there for 7hrs not even a sniff. All the baitfish was concentrated in the muddy water around the mouth of the river. Heard of 2 fish being fought all day."
986309,landry,2016-11-15 22:53:00,1005,It's been tough this year.
986311,KraTToR,2016-11-15 23:05:00,506,The Thames is always chocolate milk and not because of the wind and I've seen people catch skis in that water all the time in late fall.  Shadzillas are the bait of choice and maybe because of the vibration they produce.. who knows..
986316,Rizzo,2016-11-16 00:02:00,4754,"With the water always being chocolate milk out that way (Thames) I believe the fish are accustomed to that type of water. Near Belle River the water is more often clearer, so I think the fish are accustomed to that. Throwing some mud at the Belle River fish I think will shut them down. I could be wrong...but not gonna drive 6 hours round trip to test the theory!"
986330,PBenson,2016-11-16 01:41:00,154,"Honestly the fish are there, the bait is there, the waters clean, the waters the right temperature... I have to believe this slow fishing will eventually get better. Hopefully starting tomorrow lol."
986451,outllaw,2016-11-17 01:37:00,1232,gin cxlear waters no good at belle r. stained is best for bait and musky.. if your stuk in clean water fish 1 hour before daylight and after. watch for gulls on the shad. muskies are there.
986484,PBenson,2016-11-17 13:32:00,154,"I was out yesterday and yeah it was super clear, still no bite though. Saw some fish surface but that's about it. Lots of bait around."
986498,SuperDave,2016-11-17 18:24:00,204,"Was out Tuesday. missed a fish at boatside around 4 pm because I was not paying attention. So fished all day 10-530 saw only 1 fish and missed it because I suck lol. That's muskie fishing. All those great years at the Thames, you had to think a tough bite would eventually happen. Maybe this is that off year."
986505,lew,2016-11-17 20:09:00,12766,"Listen to what Outlaw has to say boys, he's the go-to guy for LSC muskies."
986513,landry,2016-11-17 22:45:00,1005,I can't catch much lately but I look for coloured water and avoid clearing water on St Clair in summer and Fall. That's where the baits hides out.
986573,PBenson,2016-11-18 17:31:00,154,Finally got on them good this morning. Guessing they were fired up cause of the cold front coming this weekend. Ill post the video next week!
986616,Rizzo,2016-11-19 00:02:00,4754,good stuff looking forward to see it. I have buddies hitting a few different spots tomorrow...lucky me...I get to go to the mother-in-laws birthday party instead
986620,PBenson,2016-11-19 00:54:00,154,"I don't know if you are going to miss much, there are going to be some heavy heavy winds."
986621,outllaw,2016-11-19 01:03:00,1232,"some friends did very well this rnin. Saturdays a wash boyz. do honey do..rememember if your a troller slow it down with bigger baits 10 inch chewies are doing very well .,brownsand gold split orange belly."
986654,Rizzo,2016-11-19 13:55:00,4754,my friends hit kawarthas instead...got a boat at balsam and 2 at pigeon...hope to live vicariously through them
985475,Rizzo,2016-11-09 00:01:00,4754,"25 k north today, 40 k north tomorrow...and then 35 k south on Thursday. Thursday is the day I plan to go...so can tolerate that wind. But I wonder if the visibility will be a whopping zero after these big winds from the north. Stained water great...but the chocolate milk I am not a fan of. Would the two days of north wind make it look brown like the Thames out there? Cuz if I want to fish water like that I will drive a shorter distance and do Thames!"
985479,PBenson,2016-11-09 00:42:00,154,"You'll probably be better off at the Thames but I don't think either will be great, these winds look nasty. I'm still trying to figure out my weekend plans, hoping maybe the forecast changes a bit in the next 24-48 hours."
985493,Rizzo,2016-11-09 03:25:00,4754,there is always the kawarthas I suppose!
985531,Rizzo,2016-11-09 15:08:00,4754,anyone else have thoughts? I see winds still from the north today and were strong last night. Will she be mud or maybe just a silty greyish greenish hue with a foot or two of visibility?
985554,Musky Plug,2016-11-09 18:26:00,398,"I was wondering the same thing. I was planning on going to the Belle River as well but on Saturday, the winds on sat as of now are 20km sw Might re-think my game plan."
985700,mistaredone,2016-11-10 22:50:00,913,How was the water today?  I'm hitting the Detriot on Saturday. Forcast is 15 to gusts of 20
985701,mistaredone,2016-11-10 22:52:00,913,Just checked again it's 19-24 at 1pm and higher from then on. Looks like an early morning for me
985760,Rizzo,2016-11-11 14:50:00,4754,went to kawarthas and struck out mightily
985859,landry,2016-11-11 23:24:00,1005,That sucks. South shore of st Clair looks muddy on satellite image
985880,PBenson,2016-11-12 01:49:00,154,I'm heading out on the south shore in the morning I'll let you know how bad it is. HATE north winds lol
986000,Rizzo,2016-11-13 13:25:00,4754,So what's the latest word?
986006,PBenson,2016-11-13 16:03:00,154,"I went out yesterday (Saturday) morning and fished the DR. Worst morning of the year. I fished hard for 4 hours, jigging casting, using different colours, nothing. Did not see one fish caught between every boat out there. Bait everything. Water dirty, about 10"" of visibility. Super frustrating. Im heading out for an evening bite today to try and switch things up, but it does not look promising."
986014,Rizzo,2016-11-13 17:34:00,4754,ok now I feel better. I made the call to go to kawarthas because I figured St C would be real tough. When kawarthas cough up the goose egg you wonder if you made the wrong call. Sounds like the last few days would have been tough on the south shore as well
986028,mistaredone,2016-11-13 21:22:00,913,I spent Sat morning on the DR without a sniff. Moved over to the Thames and nothing going on there either. Saw one fish caught at moon rise and that's it
986050,Musky Plug,2016-11-13 23:45:00,398,"Heading to Belle River tomorrow, will let you know how we do."
986055,Rizzo,2016-11-14 00:04:00,4754,With last weeks winds those fish have had a week off! Should be good tomorrow good luck and let us know
986063,outllaw,2016-11-14 00:52:00,1232,"some guys did very well on some big fish t-day. the lakes still producing.,slo up and bigger baits."
986077,landry,2016-11-14 02:18:00,1005,It was horrible near Belle and Thames rivers today. The lake may have been good. Dunno.
986091,PBenson,2016-11-14 03:08:00,154,I fished the evening today on the DR it was terrible too. Fished it hard even into the dark a bit and did not even see one fish caught. So frustrating.
986123,landry,2016-11-14 09:40:00,1005,Do u live right near the river PBenson??
986128,PBenson,2016-11-14 12:41:00,154,Yes
986195,Rizzo,2016-11-14 23:25:00,4754,I'll tell you what's frustrating...driving 6 hours round trip to fish there for 6 hours and seeing nothing. That makes for a long tiring ride home!
986205,SuperDave,2016-11-15 00:26:00,204,"I can relate to that Rizzo, Going tomorrow hope the fish decide to eat for a change!"
986213,landry,2016-11-15 01:21:00,1005,"That has been my story too typically this year Rizzo. But that's musky fishing - and unless you can be on the water 4 days a week it's gonna happen. Musky fishing sure teaches humility - some years or months it seems so easy and if you are not careful you can start taking yourself too seriously. I have never seen a fish that is so hot or cold. When they are on they can be downright easy to catch because they are so aggressive. When they are off, like most days I've been out this year, they are impossible. I'm jealous of PBenson - if it's no good I could be home for lunch. Instead I stubbornly stick it out for 10 hours to justify the drive. However, we have caught most of our fifties on those impossible days so who knows."
986289,PBenson,2016-11-15 18:42:00,154,Heading out tomorrow morning early so hopefullllly it turns around. I'll post a report.
