Got lucky and landed two for the dinner plate, which I am quite looking forward to (beautiful orange meat). I lost another one and had two other follows.  Only two bass were caught. I guess I will be putting the boat away this weekend. :-( "

986566,fish_fishburn,2016-11-18 16:47:00,1311,Very nice been awhile since I have caught a rainbow.
986581,Sinker,2016-11-18 18:25:00,8692,Nice size! I assume those were inland bows? Looks like a nice spot!  S.
986582,chris.brock,2016-11-18 18:25:00,4053, Beauties Jimmer! Those are big bows.
986607,Joeytier,2016-11-18 23:15:00,3990,Very decent bows for sure!  The rainbow bite has been great lately!  How were you catching them?  We usually use small harnesses and a worm slow trolled over deep water (30-50 ft)
986902,jimmer,2016-11-21 14:03:00,2730,Yes it was an inland lake.  We caught them on twister tails with a bit of worm following the shore. Seems like it happened weeks ago with the change in weather.
