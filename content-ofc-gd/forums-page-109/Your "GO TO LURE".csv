I've caught everything from panfish to a Tiger Musky going 39"". They will work for anything that swims I swear. If on foreign waters I tie on that lure if I have talked to no locals or those that have fished there. I have caught Jacks to Snook on it in Florida. I brought 1 with me to Japan and caught what looked like a type of Bull Head.  If I were to name a second all purpose lure it has to be a floating Rappala black on silver flake belly 10cm.  Third is a list too long for this thread. But Readers Digest version go to lures if I could only bring 1 bait for the species: Or 1 #4 Black Fury for every fish.  That's about what I have fished for the last 8 years and if I could only bring 1 lure for each species that's what I would bring. Why I bring 8 trays and a full Tackle Mate box of plugs, spinners, a few freezer bags of plastic, a few trays of jigs in every colour, style and size and spoons of all types your guess is as good as mine. If Yogi Berra was a fisherman he might say "" If you never need it you might got it"".

Steelhead, Lake trout, Coho, Walleye, Yellow perch, Smallmouth Bass, and Pike.  The ""big fish"" story"" was my personal best 42"" pike at camp on Manitoulin in June. The big girl followed a slow moving 7"" jointed rap up to the boat twice before retreating to her personal weed lair. On a lark and a laugh, I grabbed a lighter rod that had ""the Cleo"" on, 6lb test tied direct, that had taken numerous smallies that morning. Of course,the strike occurred as soon as the spoon ""plopped"". Three times it ran about 60 yards down the bay and then came back to hide under the boat. Each time my 85 year old father in law jumping like a monkey in the front of tinny to scare her out from under.  His net job, while breathtakingly crude, proved effective. We jumped out on shore, I handed him the camera, to which he held lens first- backwards to his eye and tried to frame a portrait of me and she. I sighed, handed him the fish in trade for the camera , and snapped a quick picture of the proud old angler. He then released her with a satisfied smile on his face, and watched as she swam away."

One could simply state ""well I catch more fish on black jigheads) ie myself, in which you could retort ""well you use a black jighead roughly 85% of the time"".  And you would be correct.

Some inland lakes and bays of Lake Erie don't have a lot of good areas for crankbait or lures with exposed hooks, so choices varied.

One of the reasons that dark colors work so well when fishing deep is there are shade differences between black and absence/reduced light. When you use the primary colors they are absorbed by water so as light loses that color band they become the same color as the surrounding waters. Black however will still show up as a bright spot or a dark spot in the water thus more visible in most cases.   Art
