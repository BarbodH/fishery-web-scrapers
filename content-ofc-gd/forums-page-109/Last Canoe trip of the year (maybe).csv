Seeing the doom & gloom on the horizon a plan comes together to try and hit virgin territory for both Brock & Chuck in which if you know these guy's those kind of lakes are very few & far in between. This trip would have us paddle & portage 4 lakes to our destination & hopefully fish would greet us when we got there. We meet up, start to unpack our gear & Brock says "" I brought a small motor, thought it might help with the big lake"" well yes, YES it did, especially on the home trip! After crossing the big lake, the motor got stashed in the bushes & it was paddles from there onward. Cross our second lake, portage into the third & our expectations were dashed abit. There was a cash of 3 boats stashed on this third lake coupled with not a single bite we thought our last lake might be a dud. After following a beaver trail that put us in the wrong direction, we stashed our boats & made our way to the fourth lake thinking there might be a few stashed boats...nope, so back we go to grab our boats. This fourth lake was truly beautiful & while nothing bit at first it wouldn't be long. Brock was chucking spoons while Chuck & I were floating worms. I wouldn't say the lake was on fire but we had a very steady pace of hook ups or hits. Most Brookies were decent in the 1/2 to 1 lb range with some larger & smaller of course, Chuck had a nice one spit the hook on shore. Had a incredible shore lunch of sausages cooked on hot rocks, beer & whiskey helped take the edge off the cold front blowing through which brought rain/sleet, hail for a moment & snow as we were leaving.                       We certainly put the boots to her this day!! Sun barely up when we started & a drop of light left when we returned....just a incredible day all round!"
986821,the spirit of fishing,2016-11-20 21:27:00,141,Sounds like you had quite an adventure. Enjoyed your report describing the emotional roller coaster ride. Nice to see the specks cooperated after the work you put in. Hope you'll be able to have some more canoe trips this year and share your success with us again.
986844,Joeytier,2016-11-20 22:52:00,3990,Another awesome adventure!  You've got a knack for catching those backlake brookies for sure!

986856,chris.brock,2016-11-21 00:18:00,4053," I'd say a pat on the back to us, we made the best of a crappy November day. I slept like a log that night and am still sore after that day trip."
986869,ckewley,2016-11-21 01:49:00,699,"After leaving & driving home, don't think I lasted 15 min through the door & slept like the dead! Sore is about right...lol Man I forgot the whiskey pic, fitting it was also a bottle kill  "

986890,Chuck Enwinde,2016-11-21 06:14:00,247,"Good fun for sure.  Shoulders probably won't be right till about Wednesday, but it's the good kind of sore.  I think the last thought I had before passing out was, thank God for that little Merc."
986896,Moosebunk,2016-11-21 12:56:00,3970,"I think you guys suffered most because of that bottle of Ardbeg.  Like a Laphroig or Dun Bheagan, that there I find has to be one of the most rugged and harsh drams to swallow.  Fitting how that works into your story of a big days effort for some final rewards.  Solid report!"

Hard core indeed!!!  Last trip?? You could prob sneak out there again this week if you had the time off!

If you are ever this way by all means, same goes to Steelheadphycho   I think you guys suffered most because of that bottle of Ardbeg.  Like a Laphroig or Dun Bheagan, that there I find has to be one of the most rugged and harsh drams to swallow.  Fitting how that works into your story of a big days effort for some final rewards.  Solid report!  I'm a Islay fan & Ardbeg is tops in my books but all of their expressions are way too pricey, the Uigeadail is quite abit heavier than the normal 10yr & I do likes me some Laphroig 10yr. HIGHLY RECOMMEND any of the Kilchoman line if you haven't tried them."
987021,Walleye'm Fishing,2016-11-22 14:56:00,310,Beauty brookies right there! You're inspiring me to maybe take one last trip before the lakes lock up...
