985717,Old Ironmaker,2016-11-11 01:53:00,8243,"This past summer I thought I was going to die because my Sinuses were plugged so badly. I asked for suggestions here and because of all the help and a suggestion for a good Hamilton Ear, Nose and Throat specialist I can now breath. My Blood Glucose levels are better, Blood Pressure has dropped to acceptable levels, my energy has gone up 50% at least. I couldn't cut the lawn and didn't feel like doing anything most days including fishing or golfing. I couldn't sleep because I couldn't breath through my nose and then my mouth was so dry or I felt like I was drowning in my own mucous 2 hours of straight sleep was good. Now I sleep ad everything above improved.  A member PM'd me suggesting I get into see Dr. Elizabeth Jeney. It is usually a 6 month wait to see her, for some reason someone cancelled and I saw her about a month ago. She probed with her magic wand and saw infection. She prescribed 500mg of Cephalexin 3X daily. Within 2 weeks I was able to breath better for the 1st time in 10 years.  I couldn't believe how much better I feel and how Sinusitis can effect ones general health. It can lead to congestive heart failure.  Thank you, thank you for all those that gave suggestions, shared their stories and gave me hope. I owe each and everyone of you. PM me and if I can help you for anything please just ask. After all these 62 years I know many,many people in many, many fields and often facilitate and broker deals.  You all know who you are that reached out to me. I have enough energy now to go back and PM you all. I hope I still have them.  This just goes to show how much more this forum is than just a place where like minded folks can share fishing experiences.  Thank you again, I can breath!!!!!!!  Johnny D"

985739,wormdunker,2016-11-11 12:28:00,1711,Happy to hear all is well John.  As you know I've been out of touch due to working in the far north & wasn't aware of your health situation.  I'm still in Kash by the way.
985740,kitch,2016-11-11 12:30:00,42,"Good to read the problem has been fixed.  Incredible how we get to feeling lousy in small increments and then, when things are fixed, we realise how awful we've been feeling for so long!"
985741,Sterling,2016-11-11 12:55:00,477,Tremendous news! Crazy to think it was an infection the whole time.
985743,grimsbylander,2016-11-11 13:08:00,3016,That medical marijuana sure did the trick!!  Glad you're feeling better.

985750,Old Ironmaker,2016-11-11 13:50:00,8243,I have partaken in the Sacrament a few times. 6 or so foot longs fully dressed and off to bed I go after a few puffs.  I have a CT Scan booked for the New Year to see what is there for sure.
985751,Big Cliff,2016-11-11 14:21:00,6899,That would be on your head wouldn't it? Geeze I hope it doesn't come back and say they found nothing
985752,Loonietoon,2016-11-11 14:29:00,1450,That would be on your head wouldn't it? Geeze I hope it doesn't come back and say they found nothing LOL

985940,Old Ironmaker,2016-11-12 21:39:00,8243,Do you see how I set you comedians up like a good straight man? If you can't laugh at yourself you can't laugh. Glad to have been of service you comedians.  I actually think that they would find dense Granite. A few years ago while jacking up a trailer with a 5 foot truck jack I didn't click in the last dog and the handle came up and hit me in the jaw. I didn't go down though. Buddy said I have a granite jaw as well as a granite skull. I have been known to be hard headed just ask my Lady.

986568,Old Ironmaker,2016-11-18 17:00:00,8243,"Thanks all for the best wishes. It is amazing how what we think are little things can effect our health so badly. We put off seeing Drs. especially us men. Don't put stuff off, it might even save your life. A pal had a dark spot on his lower back, by the time it turned ugly and he finally saw a Dr. it was too late. He died of Lymphatic Cancer within 18 months. He was told had he had it removed as soon as it appeared he would have had a good chance. His last year and a half on Earth he suffered badly through Chemo and Radiation and died an ugly painful death no Human should have to endure."
