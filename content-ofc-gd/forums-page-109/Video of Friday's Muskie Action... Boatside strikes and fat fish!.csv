986761,PBenson,2016-11-20 15:34:00,154,"So like I said in the other post we finally got on a good bite Friday. We managed to go 4/6 in 4 hours of fishing with the biggest being 48"" and a total slob of a fish. Hopefully this cold front doesn't kill the bite again!  "
986765,GBW,2016-11-20 15:49:00,8460,nicely done!!!
986786,Rizzo,2016-11-20 17:33:00,4754,right on! Seems like every time I have a chance to fish its ridiculous winds. Off tomorrow...for instance
986789,misfish,2016-11-20 17:56:00,29133,"If I lived even close to that spot, I would be out there on my toon. That would be so freaking cool. That hit and miss fish was HUGE dude. Enjoy your posts.  As for the hit and miss on fish, it,s seems to be for everything these days.  Thanks for posting.  Poor fish that you power slammed.LOL J/K."
986791,manitoubass2,2016-11-20 18:17:00,11391,Wow! Musky clinic!!!
986792,Fisherpete,2016-11-20 18:20:00,1814,"Wow some very well fed specimens! Love the video footage, hoping to start doing that in 2017. Shadzillas have been a great bait here in the Kawarthas this fall also.  Cheers Pete"
986796,PBenson,2016-11-20 18:56:00,154,Thanks man. I love Shadzillas. Work great and don't take a toll on your body like some of the heavier baits do.
986836,mistaredone,2016-11-20 22:08:00,913,Awesome video!  I might make the drive this Tuesday. The winds are looking good
986839,leaf4,2016-11-20 22:21:00,2466,"Awesome day. Great video quality/editing to boot! Bet your buddy was stoked getting one right away, I sure would be haha"
986842,Gallie,2016-11-20 22:39:00,1215,Great looking fish! Nice video man!
986860,Jds63,2016-11-21 01:00:00,1365,Great video ... that's exciting fishing !!!
986870,PBenson,2016-11-21 02:01:00,154,"Oh ya he was pumped. For whatever reason the fish were stacked in that spot. Fished it tons of times and didn't get anything then on that day and that time like 4 bites in 10 casts.  true ""feeding window"" I guess haha."
986887,scuro2,2016-11-21 04:00:00,904,Thanks for sharing...enjoyed it.
986889,PUMP KNOWS,2016-11-21 04:51:00,937,"At the 3:51 mark, did you know it was trailing your lure?  I wasn't expecting that at all...crazy!"
986891,Freshtrax,2016-11-21 07:44:00,2215,"Nice going,   I need to drag the boat down there next fall ."
986897,Moosebunk,2016-11-21 13:06:00,3970,My Lord!!! I really have a hard time believing St.Clair can suffer a slow bite.  That place is unfair for numbers and action.  Well done!
986967,SuperDave,2016-11-21 22:44:00,204,Great video! Frustration the past 2 weeks you say? Yup. Tell the guys who drive 3 hrs to fish there and get skunked!
