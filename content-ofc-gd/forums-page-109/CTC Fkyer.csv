986483,DanD,2016-11-17 12:37:00,2223,Good to know. Nothing worse then buying something and then unknowingly have to rework it to make it usable.  Dan.
986502,Ronzo,2016-11-17 19:36:00,124,"I have a slightly older version of this - it is nearly useless for ice fishing once there is snow on the lake. The short skis break through any type of crusty snow, and then the tips drop down and catch in the hole."
986504,Rodbender,2016-11-17 19:42:00,1027,$100 too much for that ski's are too short make your own for $20

Based on price I told her to just buy them as they came c/w spring shock tow bar, cover and to my surprise when she dropped them off they even have UHMW strips already installed. Bought for less than the price of just the tow bar and cover generally sell for!"
