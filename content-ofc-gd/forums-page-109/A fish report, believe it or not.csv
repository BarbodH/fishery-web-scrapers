986633,misfish,2016-11-19 03:20:00,29133,I knew I stayed up late for a special fishing report.  Nice one Harold.
986634,Old Ironmaker,2016-11-19 03:21:00,8243,"I'm jealous. Catching was a bonus eh? Look at that sky, not a cloud. Nice, nice.  Why did I put the boat away Nov 1st, duh. The best November weather I can ever remember, ever. When I was working I always went south for 2 weeks at least. Cold, wet, damp, windy, flurries, freezing rain, snow. Yuck. This is central California weather without the rain."
986635,tb4me,2016-11-19 03:21:00,3295,good catch! it sure would have been a great day to be on the water
986749,spincast,2016-11-20 13:29:00,3279,nice!
986750,GBW,2016-11-20 13:43:00,8460,very nice.
986752,SirCranksalot,2016-11-20 13:44:00,3291,"Just a leisurely aft out for a paddle with my wife dragging a Rapala behind----caught 3 small pike as well. A lot better than 2 hard days fishing with my buddy recently.  . My wife is not interested in going back out today, though, for some reason??!"

That was enough for me. Bloody line was flying off the pin.LOL"
986828,Fisherpete,2016-11-20 21:38:00,1814,Short and sweet report. Is that a bow?
986864,manitoubass2,2016-11-21 01:24:00,11391,"As dutch said.  I enjoyed it. Not every report needs 8 thousand pictures and 10 page write up.  I seen a nice fish, a canoe, nice weather and a happy angler...  10/10 in my book?"
986898,Moosebunk,2016-11-21 13:08:00,3970,"Beauty! Just the way every November day should be,"
986940,aplumma,2016-11-21 19:57:00,6896,Nice day to get out and a fish to boot good job.   Art
987024,Walleye'm Fishing,2016-11-22 15:00:00,310,"Beauty right there, congrats sir!"
987093,SirCranksalot,2016-11-23 12:57:00,3291,10/10 in my book   You're being far too kind. The Moosey reports and the Borgerman's reports get a full 10. Gimme a 6 and I'll be happy!  BTW--thx to the mod(s) for deleting that political sideswipe from another member.
987113,netminder,2016-11-23 15:47:00,514,"As dutch said.  I enjoyed it. Not every report needs 8 thousand pictures and 10 page write up.  I seen a nice fish, a canoe, nice weather and a happy angler...  10/10 in my book I actually prefer this style of report. Tell me what it is, how big it is, how you caught it and when, then show me a picture and I'm more than happy. I don't need to know what you ate, what brand the coffee was, or how many loons you saw on the lake."
