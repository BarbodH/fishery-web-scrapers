We are looking to install a wood fence down both sides of our property and chain link across the back."
986444,John Bacon,2016-11-16 23:32:00,3277,"The guy that I dealt with was Ross Fence & Decks - 905-430-4664.He did a pretty good job in our neighborhood in Scarborough.  That was about 13 years ago.  I am not sure if he is still around.I recommend that you go a little heavier than 4x4"" for the posts.  We went with 6x6s; but I think there are 5x5s available too."
986448,leaf4,2016-11-17 00:45:00,2466,Totally go with 6x6!  I did a 4x4 fence at my house 7 years ago and they are twisting like crazy
986475,Old Ironmaker,2016-11-17 08:51:00,8243,Must be bad material out there now. The fence I built in 86' looks new. A few posts checked but that's it.
