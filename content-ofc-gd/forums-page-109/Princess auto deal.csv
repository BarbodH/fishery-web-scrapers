986931,Fang,2016-11-21 18:57:00,1330,Stopped by the Mississauga store for something to do and they had 4 full pegs of the .....  Renegade Tournament Culling System  google it for an image or more details  Must be on clear out or surplus. Set me back a whopping $2.99  Don't really need one but just couldn't resist
986944,PUMP KNOWS,2016-11-21 20:13:00,937,This?  
986952,Fang,2016-11-21 21:02:00,1330,exactly that one. clips seem strong enough but for that $ gives me something to play with in the garage over the winter
986953,wormdunker,2016-11-21 21:09:00,1711,"You definitely scored a deal!  I was in the brand new Princess Auto in St. Catharines yesterday & scored a good deal on a folding mini scaffold.  Solid steel with 4 locking casters.  90 bux on sale for 46.00.  Woo Hoo!  Perfect height for reaching the ceiling for my project downstairs.  I'm applying drywall mud in the ceiling corners, after that I'll need it for painting (cutting in with a brush).  It has 2 adjustable steel supports (planks) which are rock solid when I stood on them.  I can also use it for hanging my Christmas lights on the troughs in the driveway area.  Much more comfortable than standing on a step ladder that only has a 3"" wide ladder rung."
986959,DanD,2016-11-21 21:25:00,2223,My wife calls Princess Auto the men's Avon type store; get me in there and I have to buy something. LOL It's not always the best quality of stuff; but for things I may only use once or twice a year; they make it affordable to buy.  Dan.
986971,grimsbylander,2016-11-21 23:07:00,3016,"Just orders a couple online. Thanks for the heads up Fang. The little white board and marker are worthless but the colour coded tags will work great with the right cull app. If you haven't got it, check it out, you like it."
986974,Old Ironmaker,2016-11-21 23:30:00,8243,"I can't ever pass the Princess Auto store in Hamilton, the truck automatically puts the signal on and turns into the lot. There is a Lowes across the street and my wife goes in there while I buy things I not only don't need sometimes I don't know what they are for but I know it's a great deal."
986978,Fang,2016-11-21 23:56:00,1330,I combine my few pleasures every 2-3 weeks by doing a road trip to the Hamilton Princess Auto and then roll down the street to Lococco's to shop for the best cut steaks and pork ever sold (don't even try and tell me to shop for steaks at Costco) and then a stop at fishing world. By that time the credit card is pretty warm and time to head home and plan out dinner  Last weekend was BBQ chops and finished off with a low and slow cherry wood smoke on the grill. Nothing like the sound of complete silence through dinner to measure how good the meal is. That is up until everyone has finished their chop.
986980,huzzsaba,2016-11-21 23:59:00,884,Never been to Princess Auto.  Looks like I am missing out! I will probably go check it out this week.

986990,bigugli,2016-11-22 00:57:00,6138,Walking into PA is like walking into a tackle shop. You need a lot of self control.
986994,Old Ironmaker,2016-11-22 03:58:00,8243,"Fang, Lococo's meat is good but for pork you need to go to the Pork Store on Stonechurch and Nebo on the mountain, just off the Link. Only a few minutes from Lococo's using the Red Hill expressway. I challenge anyone to find better pork anywhere. The smoked kielbasa never get all the way home so I have to put some in the trunk."
987011,SirCranksalot,2016-11-22 13:29:00,3291,"My wife calls Princess Auto the men's Avon type store;  The lady in the Gagnon's I went into called it ""Toys R Us"" for men!"
987017,Fang,2016-11-22 14:39:00,1330,"Is that placed now called Super Sausage? on Stonechurch.  OMG! I went in there a few month ago and they had some smoke cured bacon samples from the deli counter and I spent way too much. Mostly bought sausages and cold meat. Way too many good things in there to buy and eat in the car on the way home. Love the Szpek(?) dry meats  Thanks for the reminder, with this cold weather I think its time to smoke a pork loin"
987064,huzzsaba,2016-11-22 22:25:00,884,How is PA for returns or exchanges?  They have a tool I want to buy but I have had bad luck with a similar one I bought in the US.  Broke on first use and destroyed a few clamps before I figured out it was no good.  The tool in question is cv boot clamp plier.

987077,grimsbylander,2016-11-22 23:43:00,3016,"I had a wet saw that sat in my garden shed for 3 years. When when brother said return it I laughed. He was serious...I did, and they didn't blink! No one has a better return policy that I know of."
