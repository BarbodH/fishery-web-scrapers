986905,bow slayer,2016-11-21 14:21:00,1074,I picked up my helix 7 gps combo this morning from the St.thomas Canadian tire. I got them to hold it for me last thursday until I could get in and thank god I did they told they could of sold it 6 times yesterday alone. They still have a few other units left on clearance including an Elite 5 chirp.   When I was checking other stores the Kitchener west store had a hummingbird 488 ci combo on for 244 which was also very tempting.
986915,Bass Tard,2016-11-21 16:05:00,128,"Haha, thanks for other lead, I bought that one too!!  I got the 7, but was kind of disappointed that I didn't get GPS, so I ordered this one for them to hold it and I can come pick it up.  I might return the 7.."
986917,bow slayer,2016-11-21 16:25:00,1074,"yes I got the only one that had gps,all they had left in the helix this morning was the helix 7 DI with no gps"
986919,SirCranksalot,2016-11-21 16:28:00,3291,I'm not much of a techie re cell phones but I have been told that they work as a GPS even when you are out of cell phone range. With the Navionics app might render a GPS on the FF redundant.
986942,aplumma,2016-11-21 20:04:00,6896,"The lowrance transducers have many different ones and the older units are not compatible even to the point of gen 2 to gen 3.  FromLowrance website  CHIRP CHIRP sonar is cutting edge echosounder technology. Unlike the single frequency of the Broadband Sounder technology, CHIRP continuously sweeps a spectrum of frequencies. Sweeping frequencies makes two improvements to the sonar image: Broadband Sounder™ Single frequency sonar—also referred to as Broadband—is commonly annotated as 50kHz, 83kHz, or 200kHz. Broadband is essential sonar technology at its finest. Broadband relies on pings and echoes from a single frequency. This technology is great for tracking bottom, finding schools of baitfish, displaying predator fish, and bait tracking. StructureScan® 3D StructureScan 3D features a multi-beam sonar technology ─ powered by an increased number of transducer receiving elements ─ to create high-resolution, 180-degree, three-dimensional images of underwater structure and bottom contours. Transmitting at 455 kHz, the transducer not only produces tru-to-life, three-dimensional images, but also boosts the performance of two dimensional DownScan and StructureScan HD imaging. StructureScan 3D scans can reach up to 600 feet to either side of the boat, for both 3D and 2D SideScan. It scans depths of up to 300-foot for two dimensional DownScan™ Imaging. StructureScan® HD StructureScan HD allows users to scan an area with a very high frequency signal, producing picture-like images. 455 and 800kHz frequency selections allow users to choose between 455 for scanning great ranges, and 800 for close-in, higher resolution detail. StructureScan HD literally turns the sonar paradigm on its side with the ability to search to the left and right of your boat rather than only below. StuctureScan HD imagery can be overlaid on top of cartography for a detailed, up-to-date view of structure in relation to your position. Called StructureMap™,this is excellent way to find underwater structure and changes in bottom layout. SpotlightScan® SpotlightScan is boater-controlled directional sonar that allows anglers to scan an area they are interested in fishing while on approach. For use with cable-steer trolling motors, it aims two sonar signals similar to StructureScan HD in a specific direction. An angler can view productive fish-holding spots, such as drop-offs, channels, and underwater structure, before positioning a boat over top of them making it easier to find and cast to fish."

986965,Bass Tard,2016-11-21 22:23:00,128,"I've got by plenty of times in the past with a cell phone, but its not preferred.  When I'm on a new lake and want to go for a good rip, looking down at my phone all the time is a serious pain in the ass, and dangerous as mentioned."
987181,SirCranksalot,2016-11-25 02:18:00,3291,"Yeah and I'm 99.99% sure it will have one.  The one (mark4) I got had all I needed  If he uses the older one it might not provide the full functionality the new unit offers.  What if the old ran on 550mzh and the new on 950mhz...  I honestly feel 100% secure that his new one will have all he needs but may need to do a full swap on the hardware.  Most transducer mounting brackets are the same so that's one less step if so...  You were right! I bought it on-line and picked it up a couple of days ago. The pic shows what was included. I guess it was possible, but not very likely, that the unit was sold w/o a Xducer. For the price listed i would not have been surprised. "
987184,GBW,2016-11-25 03:12:00,8460,cool to hear it all worked out
987186,Bondar,2016-11-25 09:56:00,817,There's a reason all helix units are being sold off at less than half. Even the new onyx units are junk. Same rule applies you get what you pay for. It's on clearance for a reason  I have a Lowrance Elite 7 chirp on the front of my boat. Also junk. Processor is so slow loses position at low speeds while navigating and take time to lock back in   They all work depends on your expectations. Down imaging for me is key.

987192,seanik,2016-11-25 15:23:00,38,I just bought a Lowrance Elite-5 hdi combo with base map and transducer from Gander Mountain in Erie Pa for 170.00. In addition Gander Mtn. also gave a 20.00 Gdr Mtn. cash certificate that can be used starting 11/27 for most items.  This unit can also be bought on line through their website's black Friday deals. Field & Stream stores also has great deals on the Lowrance hook-7. I would have bought the hook-7 but I am making the Elite-5 into a portable unit.  Seanik
987196,troutchaser,2016-11-25 18:16:00,4,What's the best fish finder on the market in your opinion? Budget is not an issue and I am looking to upgrade my elite 4x after my buddy was marking lakers chasing me that my finder didnt even pick up... If it wasn't for him yelling to reel I would have missed out on 4 solid fish that day.
987199,Sinker,2016-11-25 18:38:00,8692,"Something wrong there. Either you didn't have your settings right, or your transducer is pooched.  The Elite 4 will mark fish all day long in any depth.  S."

Especially if there is a current, or your jig goes off to one side or the other of your hole as it drops down, or even your transducer not sitting straight down, but it should be marking fish no matter what. I have heard some people have trouble with the settings on these units, but I have only ran lowrance, so I am pretty familiar with the settings to make it work best. I find once you figure out how to set it up, you can't go wrong, and the bird units don't have near the setting to dial things in as accurate as a lowrance IMO.  S."

987229,troutchaser,2016-11-26 00:54:00,4,"It's really weird because I'd mark my jig perfectly fine, would pick up my jigs/ and subtle movements and then from no where my buddy would yell to reel and show me the chase mark on his finder after the fact. I'd mark the fish peeling off bottom eventually too but my mark was always delayed... maybe he has a fast processor or something idk but I guess I'll try a new ducer as mentioned... if not I'll just grab a Marcum"

986597,Lape0019,2016-11-18 20:57:00,647,The Helix 7 is where I would look first only because of screen size. I personally have an older Elite 5DSI and don't have any issues with it.  The elite 5 is what I would look at second on the list for sure.
986624,Old Ironmaker,2016-11-19 01:21:00,8243,"I would go for the Helix 7 combo for sure. Easy set up and accurate with a nice screen. That system was over 800 bucks when it came out if I remember, maybe more."
986625,porkpie,2016-11-19 01:25:00,2521,"I'd go with the helix 7 all day every day out of that list!  Years ago the birds sucked, but they have advanced leaps and bounds to the point I'd take one over a lowrance any day.  I run a raymarine on my boat, but previously had a 597, and use a 385 for the ice and as a portable.  Excellent units, and I understand the helix is an improvement still!"
986631,ecmilley,2016-11-19 02:36:00,2163,Chirp sonar all day long. Have a hds and a helix on boat. Bird fairly straightforward to set up but compared to the capabilities of the Lowrance no comparison in detail target separation or accuracy only place bird seems.good is faster loading.gps

Thanks for the replies.I seriously debated over the Helix 7 gps combo and the elite 5 and finally decided on the Helix mainly because of ease of use and the larger screen."
986658,Musky Plug,2016-11-19 14:57:00,398,"Good choice in my opinion. Getting is most amount of screen size for your buck, can't go wrong with that."

986814,Bass Tard,2016-11-20 20:54:00,128,Thanks!  Just went to St. Thomas to pick up a new Helix 7 for $249.
986815,limeyangler,2016-11-20 21:04:00,5204,Go for the helix 7 or Lowrance Chirp 5. if the chirp 5 has no GPS i'd say pull the trigger on the Helix 7. It comes with a basic map but you will have to shell out another couple hundred$ for a proper map chip.
