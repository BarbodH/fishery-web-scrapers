986830,Old Ironmaker,2016-11-20 21:49:00,8243,"Brian Wormdunker, I can ask my independently wealthy brand new Brother-in-law to fly us up there. He flew his twin engine to Buttonville to see a performance of our niece in a musical at St. Jacobs Playhouse last summer. All the way from St. Louis Missouri, for the day! Flew to Myrtle Beach the next morning to his beachfront condo for a round of golf then flew home to St. Louis. And you know what he probably would if I asked him, he is a good guy and wants to start fishing. I hope he lasts longer than the last Brother-in-law."
986858,manitoubass2,2016-11-21 00:38:00,11391,Geez!!! Awesome replies guys!  I hot a few things to do then ill address ideas.  Ill also give map info and detailed events of the day because its not just fishing!  Many thanks!!!  Rick
986871,manitoubass2,2016-11-21 02:02:00,11391,"Ok here goes.  First and foremost thank you to everyone that has reached out!!! Amazing folks! Truly appreciated!  Any and all donations are accepted! Its truly up to the individual(money, gear, clothing, or personal service ie Limey)  With cash donations please pm me or email me at racwall[emailÂ protected] so I can provide receipts to your generous offers!  Now to the event info  Here is the original poster of the first year.    The first year was held on Rainy River at Rainy River Forst Nations. Due to unsafe ice the event was cancelled the next 2 years.  The event is being moved Lake of the woods for a few reasons...  1. It was Elvis's plan before he passed 2. Garaunteed safe ice 3. Better winter fishing 4. Easier accomodatios 5. Ability to hold a larger attendance  Here is a picture of the general area, and fishing boundries(loosely) defined by black circle.    This is located by Morson Ontario if you wish to view on a map.  Its north of sleeman ontario.  Its a drive to spot minutes from mainland(morson,big grassy reservation, big island reservation)  There is an ice road for easy accessibilty and nearby gas and amenities  We will also be providing transport of people and gear for those with no vehicle.  Pop up shelters, 4 wheelers, gators, constructed ice huts are perfectly fine.  We will predrill holes based on the number of tickets sold. But, augers are permitted to drill where you please withing the (yet to be determined) boundries.  Three weighing locations will be available. One central, one west and one north. Also porto potties.  The fishing starts at 11am, ends at 5 sharp.  Then the awards cerimony takes place at the big grassy gym along with potluck dinner.  We also do the pennie table events and 50/50 draw at this point.  Then the Nighthawk band performs until 9-10pm.  Alcohol is prohibited (elvis was a drug and alcohol counsellor so please just be respectful) (im not gonna bar someone for sipping a mickey, but please be respectful, get drunk and our not gonna be welcome back)  Ticket prices are yet to be set but will range between 20-30 bucks/ less for youth  We have numerous categories split between adults and youth. Yourh division is 0-16 years old. Adult 17 and up  Categories are  1st walleye Biggest walleye(by measurement) Biggest northern pike (by measurement)  Must have valid fishing license.  Pending the amount of sponsors, preciously we had every angler leave with a prize, and I hope to continue that, but it will be pending.  Livebait is allowed and so are barbed hooks as per MNR regulations.  Please bring tobacco as an offerimg if possible. Im not enforcing it, its just respectful as for the traditionally families and area. All thats needed is a pinch(half a cigarette)  Ill add more as I can.  And any suggestioms are extremely welcome!!!"

986596,manitoubass2,2016-11-18 20:57:00,11391,"Ok. A little backstory here to start.  My good friend and local drug and alcohol counsellor past away 3 years ago.  Amazing man! He helped soooo many people! It was one of his passions!  He had other passions too! An angler, teaching kids mainly, to fish.  Unfortunately he died of a heart attack. And in tribute to him, with his brother and mom and dads permission, I started the ""elvis debungee memorial family day fishing derby""  The first year was amazing!!! All the friends, family and locals helped out so much!!!  The past 2 years were a dissapointment. No safe ice, so it was cancelled. Huge dissapointment.  Anyhow, this years ago. We are moving the event to LOTWs as elvis wanted it.  If ANYONE has any donations or conections to possible sponsors, please IM me.  All your help is appreciated!  This is a youth angler event! All prizes go to the kids. How can you not support that?  Help me out OFC friends in anyway possible. Its a great cause and even a jig, line, anything helps!!!  Miigwitch"
986599,aplumma,2016-11-18 21:04:00,6896,can you do paypal? I would be happy to donate some money for this cause and then you can go shopping for items you need.   Art
986600,manitoubass2,2016-11-18 21:15:00,11391,"Yep! It goes to my wifes account thought.  Id be super stoked if we could get some OFC hats or shirts, that would be wicked!  Any donations are appreciated though!   The first event we had lures etc donated and I made tackle boxes for the kids(basically all the basics you need)  Now these kids are full fledged anglers.  Mission accomplished?"
986602,manitoubass2,2016-11-18 21:26:00,11391,Pm sent art!  Miigwitch!!
986603,aplumma,2016-11-18 21:46:00,6896,"no problem check your email, donation sent. The tees and hats have never been printed we couldn't find a way to get them done cost effectively. Good luck on the event hopefully it introduce a few more kids to fishing.   Art"
986604,manitoubass2,2016-11-18 21:51:00,11391,It went through art! Many thanks!!!
986606,Old Ironmaker,2016-11-18 22:27:00,8243,"I'm in. I'll just send a cheque. Easier than me learning how to electronically. I should learn. What is Pay Pal? I'm not kidding, I've heard the word.  Art I have a contact that does hats and T shirts for me for our annual Golf tourney. Email me a jpeg of the text for hats and T's and I will get a price. I would buy one each for sure. The major cost is based on the numbers of units then the quality of the T shirts and hats, then the size and number of colours of the text. All I can do is get some prices if you wish."
986613,aplumma,2016-11-18 23:49:00,6896,"Paypal is a company that you can set up an account attached to either a credit card or bank route number and pay bills. It keeps your credit card # from the vendors and if you have an issue they will help get things straight. I use it quite often on the web so my credit card # is not in a lot of different data bases. With the email address I was able to send an amount from USD to CAN for I think 3 dollar fee and he has the money instantly.  Here is a brief wiki  PayPal's services allow people to make financial transactions online by granting the ability to transfer funds electronically between individuals and businesses.[63] Through PayPal, users can send or receive payments for online auctions on websites like eBay, purchase or sell goods and services, or donate money or receive donations. It is not necessary to have a PayPal account to use the company's services.[63] PayPal account users can set currency conversion option in account settings   Art"
986617,cheaptackle,2016-11-19 00:22:00,849,"I use the Interac email transfers directly from my bank account.  Fees range from .50 to 2.00 unless you're doing huge amounts.  Takes from 30 seconds to an hour for it to go thru.  No charge cards involved at all and fully secure to boot.  The only bump in the road is the receiver has to answer a security question created by the sender - and that's a no brainer once you've done it.  Rick, my friends might be back by the 30th so I may be a little earlier in my effort if that's the case.  Michael"
986618,Old Ironmaker,2016-11-19 00:41:00,8243,"Rick I have a box of ice fishing stuff I will never use again, rods, thrumbing rod, tip up, jigs, etc. Email me your address. I will keep a rod and a few lures for our trip to Nipp this January. Ticha will thank you for the extra room in her sewing and craft room."
986735,Old Ironmaker,2016-11-20 04:42:00,8243,Thanks Art.
986741,wormdunker,2016-11-20 09:13:00,1711,"Good for you Rick by putting forth the effort to organize this fund raiser.  I will definitely send a donation.  I prefer to use email money transfer, so simple & easy.  So easy even I can stick handle around the techy stuff.  Should I use the email address you provided me with?"
986767,manitoubass2,2016-11-20 16:01:00,11391,"Awesome! Thanks bud!  Yep, same email, ill pm it to ya just to make sure.  If I remember correctly with a transfer youll have to provide me the answer to the security question?  The firs season I held the event was wicked! We raised alot of money and donations and it all went to kids accept the 50/50 draw.  Then two years of crappy ice suspended the 2nd and 3rd yer of the event.   Now this year im hoping we can do it bigger and better! With one major change...  MOVING IT TO LAKE OF THE WOODS!!!!  super excited, got some good local companies involved already! And lots of friends to help out!  I staerted early this year in hopes to gain some more sponsorships, donations etc  Event is moved to second weekend in february"
986787,Old Ironmaker,2016-11-20 17:33:00,8243,"Lets go up there Wormdunker. You drive my Silverado might not make it all the way, I'll do the talking to keep you awake!"
986790,manitoubass2,2016-11-20 18:07:00,11391,???  Make the trip!!!
986797,cheaptackle,2016-11-20 19:00:00,849,Hmmmm.....  Michael
986799,manitoubass2,2016-11-20 19:07:00,11391,Watcha cooking up michael?
986800,limeyangler,2016-11-20 19:10:00,5204,"How about an all expenses fishing trip to Lac Seul for 2? Just get yourselves to Dryden and Ill take care of the rest. Bait, travel, gas and even tackle (if needed), drinks + snacks, hopefully some fish and a shore lunch all included. Will also include a keepsake video on a flash drive ."
986801,manitoubass2,2016-11-20 19:17:00,11391,As in youll guide? If thats the case that would be amazing!  Only issue I could think of was the tourist anglers we got. A few showed up from as far as 500km away(statesside I believe)  If I coud work that out with ya that would be an awesome prize on your part Simon!
986803,Old Ironmaker,2016-11-20 19:25:00,8243,"500 KM away is the closest Wall Mart isn't it Rick?  Mmmmm, a OFC G2G,( get together) at Lake on the Woods? Interesting. I would pass on the ice fishing derby and head up there in the spring or fall. That would be July and August looking at the latitude on the map. Must be cold in February. I can't believe there wasn't ice last year. On the river no ice, right?  I'll gather up the stuff after the games today Rick and will send it ASAP. No picking through it for yourself."
986804,manitoubass2,2016-11-20 19:30:00,11391," February here isnt really any colder than where you are I dont think? Unless its a cold front Id guess -15 to -20 ish.  3 years ago it was like -7. The slush was hard to deal with. We used a gator with tracks to weight fish. This time around were gonna do a central weigh/release station(s)  Imagine the cost and timing issues of a GTG on LOTWs? ???  It would be epic, and epic expensive"
986808,cheaptackle,2016-11-20 20:26:00,849,Rick I was thinking about what it might be like to take an extra couple days off from school and head up that way for your event as well.  Just turning it over in my mind...  Michael
986811,GBW,2016-11-20 20:49:00,8460,Event is moved to second weekend in february funny how I have a week off some time in Feb I just have to pick the week...
986816,wormdunker,2016-11-20 21:10:00,1711,"Too bad it's such a long drive.  22 hours from St. Catharines!  I'd be there for sure!  Driving through areas north of the Soo, then Schreiber, Rossport on those steep hills in a snow storm would not be much fun.  Fly to Thunder Bay, rent a truck for a week - dam I have good ideas!!"
986818,limeyangler,2016-11-20 21:14:00,5204,"As in youll guide? If thats the case that would be amazing!  Only issue I could think of was the tourist anglers we got. A few showed up from as far as 500km away(statesside I believe)  If I coud work that out with ya that would be an awesome prize on your part Simon!    Like I said, they get themselves to Dryden and i'll guide them for the day. Guidin' @ Dryden. My new serviceâ¦..catchy. I have my boaters card, all the safety equipment on board. I'm not asking for money so its not 'guiding' which cuts out all liabilityâ¦.lolâ¦i think. They will have to get their own fishing licenses if they need them and make sure they have them on their person on the day. I am running an Alumacraft 16.5' with very comfortable premium seats. I have a new Minn Kota Ulterra with i-Pilot Link, none has to even moveâ¦JUST FISH! Can arrange the time that suits the winner, prefer to go beginning of July onwards. Prize must be redeemed within 3 yearsâ¦.lol."
