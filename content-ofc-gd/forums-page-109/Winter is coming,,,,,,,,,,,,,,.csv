986843,ketchenany,2016-11-20 22:44:00,3229,"B, I should have been dead by now. I was on  a machine at over 50 km at 9th Line and when we stopped he took out ""spud"" and two hits it was water at leat two km out have come too close to dieing a few times. I've been on ice with John Powers where huts on flew by us in Owen Sound by the grain elevators! Now Imthink back were we nuts? But fun yes!"
986855,bigugli,2016-11-21 00:15:00,6138,not a good way to predict winter Bruce! Does he do it often? maybe he could become a weather person!   Cold feet nearly do me in!!!!! It s usually happens once a year.
986857,ketchenany,2016-11-21 00:30:00,3229,"I remember those days Bruce,  and when I look back, why did We think of it! There will be more after us, please be careful this coming  season. no fish is worth a life."

987156,pics,2016-11-24 14:46:00,1268,Saw a cabin cruiser out on Hamilton harbour yesterday.. sailboats last week.. winter still seems a ways off apparently..
987174,GBW,2016-11-24 21:28:00,8460,drove from Lindsay to Curve Lake today and most of the lakes I passed were skimmed over and not just the small bays
987176,NAW,2016-11-24 23:51:00,4022," LMAO  If you only knew the ice we have been on.  My thoughts exactly!!!  I have been teaching at Georgian College for a year now.  Every morning I sit and do prep work in the new building that overlooks Little Lake.  It's getting me anxious for some ice!!   When little starts to skim over, that means my muskoka Crappie back bays are ""creepable""."
986665,misfish,2016-11-19 17:06:00,29133,"With the change of the season finally here, I took the morning  from traveling, wadding in cold waters up past the jewels,  and get the toon put away. It,s been a great year thus far. Lots of miles driven,walking, and  flipping away on my float boat. Lakers,white fish,perch,trout and salmon. The bass fishing was awesome as well this year. Have no complaints at all."
986666,manitoubass2,2016-11-19 17:29:00,11391,"Well put Brian!  Winter hit us last night and boy could you tell on the highway! In a 15 minute drive we seen 5 vehicles in the ditch, all seemingly harmless but one brand new dodge upside down with the paramedic on sight. Hopefully that fella or lady is OK!  My year has been a blast as well! Fished some new waters, missed a few planned trips because of a shifting work schedule, but tonnes of hreat fishing thats for sure!  I also got to meet a few people from OFC(akashag & wormdunker) and that was really cool! Not sure where akashag is now but if I find the link he put together one heck of a blog during his cross canada adventures!  One thing bittersweet about this season is the kids are growing up. Hockey, basketball, homework, friends etc has had me fishing solo alot more this year. I miss having the team with me but it is what it is. And I feel that sediment about being out in nature, on the water, all alone. Its very peaceful and has basically become my therapy. I also picked up this lil habit of talking to myself or singing by myself out in the middle of knowhere lol.  Ill also remember this year for the silly injuries, almost dying twice on the water, and smashing all my good rods in the SUV after a round of golf hahaha. That one hurt...  Was and still is one great year!  Great post btw Brian!  Miigwich!"
986667,Terry,2016-11-19 17:35:00,14456,just finished putting my toon away too  now i need ice safe ice
986669,misfish,2016-11-19 18:08:00,29133,"just finished putting my toon away too  now i need ice safe ice   You SIR, are a bad influance BTW. I never found so much stuff in my truck that I forgot I had,or thought I had lost. Found my little tackle tray of 100+ beads and hooks under the toon bladder. Baits everywhere. Under the seats, behind the seats.  The only thing I didnt find, was the kitchen sink.  LOL"
986670,Terry,2016-11-19 18:17:00,14456,you can never take too much stuff  unless there's thin ice  then its a judgment call lol
986673,Old Ironmaker,2016-11-19 18:46:00,8243,"Sad but true. Good post Brian, both sad and exiting at the same time. What a difference a day makes. Had to be high teens yesterday afternoon sitting on buddies deck having a cold one overlooking the lake watching him string Xmas lights. I don't know if they can see the lights from NY. Happy wife, happy Louis. Flurries blowing off the lake this morning at 8 AM with 2 plus meter waves hitting the breakwall.  This was the worse season for fishing here on Erie I have seen in the 30 years fishing it. I as well as others caught not a single solitary Jumbo Perch this year, not even a dink. The lake was like soup and the fish were deep and hard to find. 3 Pickerel and that's about it. Terrible hot."
986683,leaf4,2016-11-19 19:34:00,2466,Good thing I changed to my winters yesterday while in shorts and a t shirt haha

986685,GBW,2016-11-19 19:47:00,8460,"I had a reasonable year.  Not a great numbers of keeper walleye on my folks lake but some real BRUTS!  Fished a few places new to me with Ernie and enjoyed my time out on the lake with the kids when they felt like getting out too.  I think my funniest moment of the year was at my folks place.  The neighbour had his buddies over for the weekend and they are all down on his dock fishing.  I decide to head down on our dock, have a smoke and take a few casts.  Well 2nd or 3rd cast I hook into a 28"" walleye.  They are freaking out as they had been at it for a bit and not a single fish.  So if the fishing's going to be on I might as well fire up the boat and see if I can get a few more right?  Head just out 30' and start to get a few more.  All I hear is ""can someone teach me to fish like Superman is over there?!?!?!"".  Made me laugh...  I gave them one keeper to eat.  Good post B and thanks for the story"
986691,leaf4,2016-11-19 20:25:00,2466,"Yeah I was pretty glad I did it yesterday, I was thinking of waiting till today but being off at 1 on Fridays helped my decision because the woman is off at 5 anyway"
986693,Old Ironmaker,2016-11-19 21:02:00,8243,"Thanks for reminding me about the winters. I scraped the tires for the Nissan last spring when I put on the summers. Now I have to go out and shop for tires, and then buy them just wonderful. Here comes another OFC tire thread. I think I will bite the bullet and go for Blizzaks."

986700,leaf4,2016-11-19 23:43:00,2466,"I would recommend the barum Polaris 3, they are made by Continental if my memory serves me correctly mine are dead silent when driving on asphalt as compared to other winters I've used or heard in the past are super loud, I have them on my vehicle as well as a couple friends of mine also have them on theirs and they all love them as well  http://www.tyrereviews.co.uk/Tyre/Barum/Polaris-3.htm"
986702,manitoubass2,2016-11-19 23:47:00,11391,Same up here.  Even RR had temps in the upper 70's
986722,Moosebunk,2016-11-20 03:32:00,3970,"  Agree with ya Brian on many points but probably these most.  Came in just a half hour ago, poured a scotch and warming up here by the fire.  Brenda came out with me today and we managed a small muskie on what was a nice day that turned bumpy on the St. Larry.  A trooper we stayed out 3 hours into the dark cause she wanted to keep on the hunt for a fish on ""her turn.""  (a true supertanker she lost in early October)  She's really taken to muskie fishing this season and after spending much of the past week on the water with several old buddies from highschool, my dad, Brenda and alone, I gotta say it's always just great to be out there man no matter!  Enjoy company as much as the solo time, to as you say, just think about the fish and life.  Can't say yet if the boat will be away for good.  Would like a crack or two at Quinte and another two muskie outings at least, but there's no pulling the trailer when there's salt and slush on the roads.  Happy to have put in the time I did into fishing this past year and really quite stoked with how well all things went; especially because only an ice fishing trip had been planned and the rest was left all up to fate, really.  Rick, if you haven't, you should read Doug's blog posts of his cross Canada trip.  He's a great dood and it's cool you two met up out west.  Once the softwater season ends, I'm actually looking forward to the break. So see ya around more I guess. lol."
986732,manitoubass2,2016-11-20 04:16:00,11391," Id like to re read it as it was an awesome story/adventure.  You got a link handy? If not Ill have to scour my emails to find it.  We actually met up in my hometown. Originally he was gonna camp in my yard so we could fish, but my work schedule changed like 3 times and I didnt want to inconveniece him as he had his trip well planned out.  We hit the emo inn for breakfast, shared some stories, and I brought him a lb of smoked sturgeon and in return I got some canned moose that looked horrible but was amazingly tasty!  Great guy and boy im glad his US customs experience worked out, that coulda been real bad!!!  Found it! Have a read folks its a good one!  http://dougsgreatwesternroadtrip.blogspot.ca"
986737,Old Ironmaker,2016-11-20 04:56:00,8243,"I was going to ask for a link, you read my mind. Thanks.  Lucas where did you get your Continentals? I'm close to Hamilton. I don't think you got them in the UK, that site spells tires, tyres and the prices are in Pounds! Thanks for the recommendation."
