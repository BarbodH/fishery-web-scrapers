The only action I saw was a few seagulls dive bombing for ??? and watching a couple of guys tossing large spinners across the bay...  As pleasant the weather was there were no fish to be had, nada,  nuttin',  zilch...  I know now why we call it fishin' instead of catchin' !  I hope you guys did better...It was not all bad...I didn't have to clean no stinkin' fish...LOL"

Fishing will be a bonus.  Ya giver a go. BONUS to you."
986638,manitoubass2,2016-11-19 04:02:00,11391,Sometimes washing lures or drownin worms is the best way to have a crappy day lol.  Good on ya getting out!
986640,Old Ironmaker,2016-11-19 05:09:00,8243,Beats sitting around wishing you were fishing. A bad day fishing is better than the best day working Mr. Beans. You go man!!! I had to scrap a good garage fridge I forgot had a box of worms in it. Lucky it wasn't the one in the house. She would have divorced me a few years sooner.
986652,Rizzo,2016-11-19 13:47:00,4754,oh ya been there done that. My last trip had same results...still great to get out tho
986656,Sinker,2016-11-19 14:34:00,8692,"It sure was a nice day to be fishing.I was workin, so you got me beat!  S."
986659,OhioFisherman,2016-11-19 15:02:00,6623,What's fishing?
986663,SirCranksalot,2016-11-19 15:59:00,3291,Even a 'no-fish' fishing report is better than no fishing report!  . Great excuse to get out and enjoy the day. If folks just saw you sitting there w/o the pole they might bother you with questions asking if you're OK!!  Maybe you should talk to yourself more often?   Sometimes I find that's the only way of getting a good conversation going.
986668,captpierre,2016-11-19 18:03:00,2521,Hey Beans. I'm not far from you up there. Would be good to take you out next year if you're game

Sometimes I find that's the only way of getting a good conversation going.  I talk to myself quite often...always get such intelligent answers...LOL!   Hey Beans. I'm not far from you up there. Would be good to take you out next year if you're game  Thanks for the offer Cap'n...I shore fish only now because my bad back and legs curtail me from getting in and out of a boat...that is why I had to get rid of ''The Tin of Beans''...I basically go into hibernation now until next spring when the crappie come in to shore...I'm glad I don't have to climb that hill up to your place on the south shore...  Nice of you to think of me...
986689,GBW,2016-11-19 20:03:00,8460,You have me beat too. Had to work this AM
986725,Moosebunk,2016-11-20 03:34:00,3970,"Good day to be outside today.... Tomorrow, not likely so much. lol."
