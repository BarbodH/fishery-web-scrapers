986549,BillM,2016-11-18 14:17:00,17367,Hope you do better than me.  I was out yesterday - not even a sniff.  That's probably Dougs fault though
986619,captpierre,2016-11-19 00:47:00,2521,Boat winterized and tucked away. Wifey and I canoed the shoreline at the cottage on Pigeon today. Trolled a small gold HuskyJerk. Looking for smallies. 2 Muskies in ten minutes.  Unexpected. Both about 36 in. Landed both by hand. No leader. 10 lb nanofil. Was surprised I didn't get bit off. Line in mouth both fish. Last kick at the can. Great way to end
986705,Fisherpete,2016-11-20 00:45:00,1814,"Couldn't have asked for a nicer day on the water - no wind and warm in late Nov... 3 follows and 3 landed. 37"" 39"" 41"", all nice chunky fish. Here's the 39 and 41 pics... I don't think either of these fish have ever soon a lure before, absolutely pristine specimens. It's been a good fall, will be posting a muskie season recap soon.  Cheers Pete    "
