986677,kickingfrog,2016-11-19 19:09:00,8333,Thanks guys. It is company auction and the starting bid is $125. I don't think it will get much attention so I'll keep an eye on it.
986679,Pickeral eater,2016-11-19 19:29:00,155,Own two of them and do a great job.  im a bigger guy so it's really a personal hut

986727,Moosebunk,2016-11-20 03:40:00,3970,"$125 Rob...!  You can't go wrong.  They're all pretty much the same but I replaced a 2-man Instashak with the Rapala and I think the working parts seem more durable on the Rapala.  The Instashak lasted me 3-years but there were a coupe little tweaks necessary to make it last longer.  I did put a shart-tonne of use on that Shak and wasn't always gentle (400km's bouncing in a sleigh X3 and more)  The 2-mans are great for heating up quick.  Solo they're perfect, a kid no issue, a second adult and forget it."
986895,TheTallPolak,2016-11-21 12:50:00,26,"But the thing is , you want it to last a few seasons , dishing out money every couple of years if the stuff breaks is no fun. I bought the Clam Thermal 4 yrs ago , a little more money but I've had no issues other than the carry bag is all ripped, but it's been dragged around and in and out of pickups so it's expected but the shelter is still good .  Depending how old your shelter is, you can contact clam, they have sent me a new bag (after 2 years of owning mine) because the bag was ripped!"
986524,kickingfrog,2016-11-18 02:04:00,8333,Rapala sherpa pop up shelter (2 person). Thoughts?

986533,adempsey,2016-11-18 03:40:00,1498,"I'd imagine as good as any of the cheap pop-ups.     I'd say they last 2 years of regular use.   The windows will likely crack before that.   Hopefully the poles don't snap.  Although, my bud replaced a broken pole with a chimney sweep rod for fairly cheap.  So, my thoughts are the cheap pop-ups are basically the same."

Pretty much nailed it with that comment. I totally agree. Its when you make the jump to thermals, is when you're stepping it up, and then, hear various different opinions."
986538,manitoubass2,2016-11-18 04:59:00,11391,"Its a shelter.  If it protects you from wind and rain, its worth it"
986539,Chuck Enwinde,2016-11-18 05:18:00,247,"I have the bigger one too.  No complaints thus far. They go on sale at CTC quite often so I would be hesitant to pay full pop.  Also, they turn in to giant kites when its windy, always sink one of the anchors before you open it up."
986543,canoecarrier,2016-11-18 11:44:00,54,"I wouldn't recommend it, I went through a few of those cheap pop ups. The Sherpa was the last one I returned before I took the hit and bought an insulated pop up. Wait for a sale to come on and snag a good one up."

986546,TheTallPolak,2016-11-18 13:44:00,26,Will you be fishing alone only or with someone else?  Best investment I ever made was going with a Thermal Tent (Clam XL 4000T) and I fish with my buddy on a regular basis (at least once a week for several hours)  Consider a Clam Thermal tent before making your purchase!

986577,Jds63,2016-11-18 18:12:00,1365,Nice !!! I much prefer a permanent shelter and just use the portable for quick run and gun stuff .

I have had my Eskimo 2 man going on my 4th year now. Snapped a pole due to rushing the closing of it. Replaced it with one of those fiberglass drive way markers. ( easy to replace the poles ) I found it a pain sometime opening on windy days. Trying to hold that bit of a tab fabric loop they have to pull the sides out. It,s a learning curve at first, but I can set mine up in minutes even on the windiest days. I made a simple hook to grab the eye bolt, not the fabric loop. ( those loops break ). Also using bungie cords instead of the shoe lace that comes with them is much easier.  Putting the anchors in is a breeze with the adaptor I made for the dewalt. One thing I like about mine, is how tight it is. No flapping walls in the wind. Solid hub IMO.  As for the windows. I have heard the same thing. If you play with them when it,s cold out, the bust up. I have never touched mine. I hardly even have the flaps that cover them open.  I just leave the two vents open. Thats enough fresh air coming in.  I can even have my mitts on when using this simple home made hook. Works like a charm.      I even made my own screw anchor adaptor. Makes quick work using the dewalt."
986650,Sinker,2016-11-19 13:10:00,8692,"Have a pic of the drill adaptor brian? Ive been looking for one.  I have a 5 man eskimo. Its huge. I havent used it on the ice yet, but i bought it with intentions of bringing a bunch of kids perching.  I also have one of the costco pop ups. I have put 2 good seasons in that one and broke a zipper on the door. It was my own fault, and it still works, just have to leave a 6"" section open all the time.  I have a clam scout flip over, and a clam guide flip over and both have been flawless. The scout had been in service for at least 10 years now. Its my go to. The guide is for behind the sled with a passenger.  I also have a 4x8 hardside, and an 8x10 hardside with a woodstove.  I cant wait for hardwater! My favourite season!!  Go as big as you can and you cant go wrong with the thermal units. That will be my next purchase, but since i have 5 ice huts i may need to sell a couple off first.  S."

I have a 4 person...we fish comfortably with 2, and not so comfortably with 3. As far as quality...I bought a cheap one USED off someone on this site about ten years ago...still using it! But I only get out two or three times a year. For that amt of use it does just fine. Gonna fish twice a week? Then go better quality"

986671,Old Ironmaker,2016-11-19 18:35:00,8243,"A tip for the zippers on your pop ups, boat windows, tents actually anything with a zipper. Rub birthday candles across the zippers, they will be smooth as silk no matter the temperature or lack of use. Metal, plastic or nylon."
