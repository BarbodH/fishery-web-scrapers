986710,SirCranksalot,2016-11-20 02:41:00,3291," I shouldn't be too big of a problem for many who live in the city.  Most families have two or more cars.  You can have one electric vehicle for getting to and from work and around the city and still have a regular vehicle for any long drives.  I think this rationale will let them gain a foothold in the cities, then spread outward as more fill stations spring up in the burbs. Maybe, for e.g, a big mall in the burbs would install a fill station to attract urbanites with electrics??"
987225,Jigger,2016-11-25 23:39:00,1237,"There are charging stations popping up everywhere. The price of fuel alone negates the price of the vehicle. Im not too big on the falcon-wing doors, but the overall design is super slick."

987263,huzzsaba,2016-11-26 16:22:00,884,"so are these 7 people midgets? I would love to see 7 guys my size (6'4) try to fit into that thing comfortably, the owner of the model x I drove is well over 6 foot. he was able to sit in the third row.  I think one of the biggest benefits to these electric cars is even though the trunk may suffer a little due to the third row, there is always a storage where the engine should be!"
987278,Weeds,2016-11-26 17:51:00,782,And what 7 seater would fit seven  6'4 guys comfortably? Can't imagine your typically going to find 7 guys 6'4 together very often.

Im not too big on the falcon-wing doors, but the overall design is super slick.  Are the charging stations free to use?  If you have to pay for the electricity to charge the batteries, then price of fuel isn't going to offset the purchase price of the car; especially if you need to replace the battery."

986437,huzzsaba,2016-11-16 21:51:00,884,"So I bumped into a friend of mine at a dinner event last week.  I found out prior to that that he had bought a Model X (7 seater) and we talked about the car for some time. finally he asked me if I would like to take it for a spin and I am glad he did.  I am not that into speed, but love having something with a little bit of power. He told me to step on it and wow!!! This thing is fast! Faster than anything I have driven in the past.  We finally get on the highway and he tells me to put on the autopilot. I must say it was freaky in the beginning since you see the steering moving like its possessed, changing lanes on a dime. The interior was very spacious and comfortable.  The ride was very comfortable and handling was pretty impressive for a big car.  All in all, I was sold on it.  But for now I will stick to my Volvo until I win the lottery lol.  "
986439,glen,2016-11-16 22:31:00,2641,Sounds great. I want one that cooks bacon and eggs while I ride in the back seat.
986441,captpierre,2016-11-16 23:09:00,2521,Some great features for sure. But downsides too. Range anxiety especially when juice needed for heating and air conditioning Consumer Reports doesn't recommend them any more. No oil changes. ?
986442,Old Ironmaker,2016-11-16 23:10:00,8243,"I didn't realize that auto pilot cars are out there already. I was under the impression they are still in the test phase. I am really surprised they are out in public. I don't think I like the idea yet. Maybe that lady doing her hair and makeup the other day doing 100K was on auto pilot.  I want one so I can post here on drive you guys bonkers on OFC while the car gets me to wherever I want to go, as long is it isn't 51 k's away and I don't have enough juice to get home.  Are there charging stations out there besides the GTA?"
986443,John Bacon,2016-11-16 23:28:00,3277,The auto pilot definitely isn't ready to replace the driver quite yet.  There was a guy killed recently when his Tesla drove into a truck.  He was heading into the sun and theory is that the auto pilot was not able to detect the white truck against a light background.  I guess the auto pilot is good enough to make people think that they can rely on it; but not quite good enough for people to actually rely on it.

Are there charging stations out there besides the GTA?  My friend drove his from Mississauga to Algonquin.  He had to recharge in Huntsville. Lucky for him Huntsville has a supercharger.  I believe the bigger cities have the superchargers already. Supposedly takes 45 mins for a full charge.  Model X range is around 300 kms per charge I believe based on how you drive.  I agree with you on the range anxiety part!"
986446,Old Ironmaker,2016-11-16 23:56:00,8243,"I definitely am pessimistic as far as the auto pilot cars go. I am very surprised the MOT is allowing them on public roads. Our provincial government doesn't trust us enough to cross the street, thus the flashing, beeping, bird tweeting and a timer on a crosswalk but auto pilot cars are safe enough? Do these cars have a big banner across the rear warning it is an auto pilot car, if not they should. I want to know myself so I can get away from it.  The other downside to a auto pilot electric vehicle is the cost. They are expensive to buy and operate. I don't know about maintenance but a neighbour has a 1st generation Toyota Hybrid and his new battery bank was over 6 grand to replace. Similar to dropping in a new tranny I guess but I just bought a series 48 battery for my Silverado for 100 bucks and I don't expect to ever drop a new 4X4 tranny in it if service it as recommended.  edit: I was quoted $225.00 for a new battery from the good guy I do all my service for the truck and my wife's Nissan. I am more than happy with Mikes service at Caledonia Tire Caledonia On. The same battery, no actually better battery was $99.99 from Acme Battery Parkdale Ave. N. Hamilton. Including the same warranty. He is the wholesaler to many shops. Cut out the middle man saves big bucks. I have been dealing with Acme for 40 years."
986447,SirCranksalot,2016-11-17 00:28:00,3291,The autopilot is not infallible but prob better than a lot of the hosers out on the road texting each other to see which bar they are going to!

986456,Old Ironmaker,2016-11-17 02:34:00,8243,"Absolutely I relish the day someone can launch and retrieve their boat with out seeing a Gong Show. I am following Canada's Worst Driver this year that they filmed down the road at the old Dunnville Airport the past summer. Talk about a Gong Show. A friend does the security when they are filming and I have been there when they do film a few times this past summer. Man the best free entertainment ever. One idiot admits he needs 4 beers or more to get him relaxed enough to drive and admits to no less than 20 hit and runs in the last 2 years. I guess I trust auto  pilot compered to that goof. Another can't drive without her phone on her lap and texts no less then 1000 times a day and 100% of the time when she drives, it relaxes her. There are only 1440 minutes in a 24 hour period. Another Hippy reads poetry and touches her beads with both hands and uses her legs to steer to drive as she chants her Mantras.  I want 15 minutes in a room with them and a bucket of water and a towel."

986462,John Bacon,2016-11-17 03:17:00,3277,I definitely am pessimistic as far as the auto pilot cars go. I am very surprised the MOT is allowing them on public roads.  I think the technology moves faster than law makers can keep up.  I don't think they are allowing them so much as they just haven't addressed the issue yet.  I think you still need a sober driver paying attention in the drivers seat.  I don't think that you can legally text away on your phone because you have the autopilot turned on.
