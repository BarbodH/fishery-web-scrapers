987197,Tjames09,2016-11-25 18:23:00,664,Looking at getting another rod for this winter. It will be for Walleye and maybe trout. Wondering what action and length to get.
987198,Sinker,2016-11-25 18:37:00,8692,"Everyone will have their own opinion on this. I like a med to med/heavy rod, 36""+   S."

987203,Terry,2016-11-25 19:57:00,14456,"I like longer ones on the ice, 36 is good  I like med or lighter in a hut you need shorter rods  28 "" or whatever size is good in you hut"
987204,Raf,2016-11-25 19:59:00,3495,match it to the lures you will be using.  ie if you're jigging heavy spoons for trout you propably want a heavier rod than if you were using small soft plastics.
987205,Joeytier,2016-11-25 20:00:00,3990,"I use a 28"" med action rod for almost all of my fishing...don't overthink it.  I will use a MH 36"" rod for lake trout fishing but that's pretty well the only exception."
987207,porkpie,2016-11-25 20:09:00,2521,"If your in a hut, don't go over 30 inches or you'll regret it.  I have a pair of 36 inch rods that hardly see any ice time as I mostly fish in a shelter unless the weather is perfect.  They're great out in the open though."
987211,Sinker,2016-11-25 21:45:00,8692,"I use my 36""ers in the hut all the time. Whats the problem with them in a hut? Length? I don't have an issue, even in my one man clam. I just find the longer rods provide more action to play fish on. The short rods, you may as well hand bomb them up.  S."
987212,misfish,2016-11-25 21:49:00,29133,"My rapala r rods are 36"" med/heavy. Used for lakers and whities. In my hub, no problem."
987213,SirCranksalot,2016-11-25 21:53:00,3291,"I use a 28"" med action rod for almost all of my fishing...don't overthink it.  I will use a MH 36"" rod for lake trout fishing but that's pretty well the only exception.  I guess it depends on the type of fish being targeted. I fish for the smaller lakers in Muskoka rather than the bigger(but scarcer) ones in Simcoe. IMO, based on this experience, it doesn't really matter much what kind of rod you use. The drag on the reel, rather than the flexing of the rod, provides most of the resistance to the fish.,"
987217,Sinker,2016-11-25 22:05:00,8692,"Yeah, spend your money on the reel for sure. Nothing worse than a cheap real in the winter. Useless.  S."
987220,porkpie,2016-11-25 22:34:00,2521,"If find they get in the way of everything myself, your mileage may vary."
987223,Acountdeleted,2016-11-25 23:26:00,2562,I use different Rods for walleye and lake trout.  Walleye - 28 inch Medium lite with a spring bobber.  Lake trout - 36 inch medium heavy ugly STIk
987224,DRIFTER_016,2016-11-25 23:39:00,10439,"For lakers and pike I use solid glass 32""-42"" MH custom rods. Short ones in my Frabil and longer ones outside."
987375,AKRISONER,2016-11-28 13:51:00,5558,my walleye and pike rod is a medium fenwick elite tech...been a fan of them and the aetos.  if you are planning on fishing lakers get a heavier longer rod with a sienna 1000 and you are set.
987386,NAW,2016-11-28 15:37:00,4022,"I like to feel every little tick or tap on the end of my line.  So a Med. Heavy action, with some good back bone for walleye.  It's also my Laker, and white fish rod.  Running 8 to 10 lb braid, with a 6' fluorocarbon leader roughly 8lb test.  I have a 36"". and a few smaller ones as well.  Depending on the hut I'm fishing out of.  My fat fish, I can use the 36"" rod no issues.  But my hut for white fish on simcoe is narrow, and the 36"" is a bit to long, so I use my shorter one for that hut.  My preference is the longer rod though, as other have said, you get to play the fish a little more.  But you need to make sure you have the right stiffness of rod to match the style of jigging your doing, and the weight of lure your using.  There's a few things to consider...."
987392,crappieperchhunter,2016-11-28 17:17:00,2582,I have to have a 28 or shorter in my hut...anything longer and I'm constantly whacking the roof on missed hooksets. I have stiffer 28's for walleye/whitefish/lakers and real light ones for perch and crappie.  I've tried to tone the hooksets down to not whack the roof but I just have not been able to.  Like others have mentioned I think a good quality reel is more important. Garbage reels are twice as annoying when they are used in the cold.
987398,GBW,2016-11-28 18:10:00,8460,with a sienna 1000 and you are set. Best point there is the reel.  I am planning to pick up another 1000 series shimano this week so when my kids are with me they have a good reel that I don't need to worry about.  Most of my rod's are 28's due to hut size or set up in the hut

Perfect for lakers...i picked two up on sale for 20 bucks a pop a couple weeks back.  Obviously you can go more expensive, but even if you blow one up (I have)...whats 20 bucks? The drag system in them is as good as any 100-200 dollar reel. Trust me i had a pike with a 20+ inch girth take my line for a ride across the entire lake last year and the thing performed flawlessly.  I think some of the laker chasers will agree as well.  You arent casting the things, so a good drag system is everything."
987433,Moosebunk,2016-11-29 01:40:00,3970,32 or 36. Medium... or medium/light. Pretty well only use the Premier Ice Rods from St.Croix. Never an issue. Great for eyes and lakers.
