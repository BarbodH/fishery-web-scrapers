Roped the son and daughter in for a perch hunt, and we were well rewarded fishing both the Welland canal and the Welland river from shore.  The only problem is that I get stuck cleaning all the fish ( Funny. I vaguely remember my Gramma complaining about the exact same thing many years ago)."

First off, nice haul Bruce and time with family. Second off, I taught my boys how to do fish. They would stop by and show me thier catch. Oh btw, can you clean,,,,,,,,,,,,PLEASE.  We both know, we like to show off our knife skills. plus there was a 90/10 split. Ya, 10 for me. LOL"

987351,bigugli,2016-11-28 00:24:00,6138,"How many?   Good size?  You're keeping me in suspense! Got ourselves a good 2 dozen and some. Nothing like lake jumbos, but respectable 9-10"" inland fish.

We will have a nice big fry with all the kids and grandkids under one roof later this week. One of Grampa""s rule is everyone shares a meal together every week. Everybody but the Mrs. loves fish."
