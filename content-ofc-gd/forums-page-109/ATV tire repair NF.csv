986378,mistaredone,2016-11-16 16:38:00,913,Just found a fair size nail in my ITP mud lite atv tire. Would any tire shop be able to repair this or should I bring it to a specialty shop?  Anyone had experience with a field repair kit?  Do the plugs last or should I get it professionally done?  Thanks
986382,DanD,2016-11-16 16:44:00,2223,"A patch from inside would be best. A plug from the outside, on an off road tire could easily get pulled out or loosened from wheel spin. A combination patch plug is about the best repair. The patch seals the air leak and the plug portion fills the hole that the puncture has made. Forgot to add. Most any tire shop or garage for that matter should be able to do the patch for you. Save yourself some money by taking the tire/wheel off the machine; no sense paying labour for that.  Dan.  "

986454,Old Ironmaker,2016-11-17 01:59:00,8243,"I think Dan would agree that not all punctures are pluggable depending on the location and size of the puncture. I trust my tire guy and I got a good size bolt in a tread that he repaired, another was a small screw in the indent of the tread profile that he wouldn't guarantee fixable. Thinking about it now it may be the other way around. Which is it Dan? When is a puncture not pluggable?  Regardless no need to go to a specialist if your guy is any good."
986479,DanD,2016-11-17 11:50:00,2223,"If every puncture, hole or slice in a tire was the same, it would be easy to explain what is or is not repairable. Considering it's not; I look at the size and location of the damage, along with the construction of the tire. Then I decide whether or not I stick my neck out and attempt a repair. Something a lot of people do not consider or know; me and every other licensed tech; that is being paid to perform safety related repairs, can be held liable; if whatever safety related repair is found not to be within accepted SAE standards. Criminal negligence charges can be laid; if an accident has happened and it's found that the repair was at fault. So if the next time a tech tells you its not safe to repair whatever it is; don't argue, fix it right or replace it. You also have the option of taking your broken car somewhere else and let a tech that don't give a crap fix/patch it for you. A 20 dollar questionable tire repair is not worth my lively hood or someone's life; but there are guys out there that will take your money for that patch. I'm the crook wanting to replace the tire and the other guy is the hero for fixing it; until that tire blows out and you're in the ditch or worse. Stepping off soap box. Sorry.  Dan."

As for the ATV tire repair, depends where the puncture is whether it can be fixed or needs to be replaced. A tube is an option."
