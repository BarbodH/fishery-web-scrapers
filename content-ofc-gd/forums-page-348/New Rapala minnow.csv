746984,kickingfrog,2012-11-27 00:58:00,8333,Interested in the new BX minnow. Wondering if anyone in has seen it in stores in Canada. I want to see it first hand before buying.
746987,big guy,2012-11-27 01:04:00,414, nice    really like the colour of the bottom one
746989,kickingfrog,2012-11-27 01:08:00,8333,Sure looks like a smelt.
746997,Acountdeleted,2012-11-27 01:29:00,2562,Cool. I'll be picking up the bottom one and the perch coloured one. Can't go wrong with a good perch minnow.
747023,adolson,2012-11-27 02:36:00,783," Certain lakes around here, that's really all I would use and always catch something."
747029,wildeye rainbow,2012-11-27 03:34:00,123,"I like the finishes.  Dang, more lures to add to the collection.  WR"
747034,musky_hunter,2012-11-27 03:49:00,328,Checkout some new lures i just got..the finish and detail are amazing.  AR Lures wood cranks from Japan     Can't leave out my fav. megabass.    Newest White Python    
747396,NAC,2012-11-28 11:58:00,369," True, but I'll stick with Live Target for the closest thing to a smelt."
747397,Rich,2012-11-28 12:02:00,3927,Looks like an x rap without fur.
747404,hirk,2012-11-28 12:32:00,571,"If you see them in a store look close at the body design,they are designed too roll left to right when twitched,I have one but have not fished it yet,a very nice bait"
747518,kickingfrog,2012-11-28 18:18:00,8333, Looks similar maybe (it is a minnow imitation after all) but it's balsa not hollow plastic.
747521,BillM,2012-11-28 18:25:00,17367,Does it suspend or float?  Sounds like a killer early season pike bait.
747523,backbay,2012-11-28 18:29:00,773,"KF, my fishing partner had a sample this fall. The minnow is rounder than an x-rap, kind of like an x-rap that gained a little weight lol, and as you mentioned, is balsa, so it floats. Very nice looking bait, I'll grab a couple for fishing the shallows next spring."
747527,kickingfrog,2012-11-28 18:45:00,8333," It floats, but you could doctor it just like the originals before the suspending husky jerks came out."
747566,BillM,2012-11-28 21:06:00,17367," You don't catch fish, you just troll fish forums!  We know!!!!   LOL!"
747571,BillM,2012-11-28 21:14:00,17367, LMAO!  Did you mean in or out?
749385,Dabluz,2012-12-05 05:05:00,701,"  I bought a couple of Live Target smelt imitations a couple of years ago but since then, the smelt imitations no longer have the same colour as the one's I bought.  They are more brownish now.  The smelt in my area are bluish/purple....not brownish."
749387,Joeytier,2012-12-05 05:10:00,3990,There is an X-rap Countdown scheduled to be released pretty soon [i think?] as well.  Really looking forward to that one.
749430,Eazy,2012-12-05 16:12:00,260," Pretty sweet looking!......Although, I think that when rapala came out with the x-rap, they really out-did themselves!"
749447,NAC,2012-12-05 17:41:00,369," must be all the frogs in the water over there. I've had one for three years and over a hundred fish, slightly faded but same colours and works like always.  I do upgrade the hooks every now and again."
749453,kickingfrog,2012-12-05 18:30:00,8333, Sounds like too much UV exposure maybe?  I picked one up shortly after they came out and I haven't noticed any colour fade/change.
749456,kickingfrog,2012-12-05 18:35:00,8333,My mistake. Although they have more smelt colours now then before. Sounds like the store isn't carrying all the selection?
749459,kickingfrog,2012-12-05 18:45:00,8333,Time to shop online.
