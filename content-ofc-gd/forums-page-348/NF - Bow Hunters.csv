749464,jedimaster,2012-12-05 19:03:00,3472,"Ok, so I am on my way to go pickup my new crossbow...After much deliberation I am getting a carbon express covert SLS. Why not an excalibur... Well for 599, I get 355 fps and a much smaller albeit heavier frame. Anyway, this thread isn't about me. its about this awesome video I saw on the interent while looking at reviews on my new crossbow...   http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BSjCY2kGyfI"
749467,Christopheraaron,2012-12-05 19:36:00,3525,that's awesome!
749468,NAW,2012-12-05 19:59:00,4022,"Cool design.  Thanks for posting.  Looks like a really heavy weapon.  If you are so weak (injured, elderly,disabled,etc...) that you can't draw a crossbow, then I doubt you would want to lug that beast into the back 40!  I also wonder about the legalities of an auto loading cross bow.  A limit on bolts in the ""magazine""??"
749471,jedimaster,2012-12-05 20:13:00,3472,The limbs look lie they can be to strong either but the deisgn looks pretty sound. Very cool setup none the less.
749473,jedimaster,2012-12-05 20:16:00,3472,This one is pretty sweet too...  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QS4RKoRyTik

749475,Christopheraaron,2012-12-05 20:24:00,3525, I think it's disabled everywhere...
749478,jedimaster,2012-12-05 20:38:00,3472,works in youtube. they do that because if you watch a video thats embedded the person who published the video doesn't make any money from you watching it. Its an option when you publish a youtube vid.
749489,captpierre,2012-12-05 21:24:00,2521,Now we need an electric musky reel!
749498,Roy,2012-12-05 22:01:00,13728, They've been available for years.
749649,jedimaster,2012-12-06 14:49:00,3472,Does this mean I can remove the NF tag on this thread?
749653,NAW,2012-12-06 15:01:00,4022,  You can use them for bow fishing.  Definitely fishing related
