748875,Christopheraaron,2012-12-03 03:45:00,3525," The reason we aren't ""superhumans"" is because things only evolve as they need to recently (within the last couple hundred years) we haven't experienced the need to change, if a problem were to arise them yes we would change more drastically.  I dont really know much about thermodynamics so I cant comment on that.  ""Living things never come from nonliving things"" the term ""living"" doesn't really mean anything, there are a few common traits to all living things (reproduction, growth, etc) but really it's just a specific formation of small non living things.  Complex systems like the eye can evolve bit by bit actually, if an organism starts out blind but then develops the need to see over time it will create a way of seeing, the first version won't work perfectly, so it will change again, and so on until it functions properly.  I don't think you know what your talking about in number 6  And even if the chances of life being created are 10 to the 100th to one its still a chance.  Anything I missed?

If I left that turd there for a million years or so, could that turn into a population of millions of plants, animals and people? An evolutionist MUST say yes to this question. In fact, my turd has an infinitely greater probability of evolving than their own theories can explain. Why? There is an explanation of how it got there (my Mexican food did not agree with me and I was too lazy to flush) and it already has living matter! Where did your primordial goo come from and what caused it to live? From this day forward NO evolutionist should ever flush a toilet, as they could very well be flushing the common ancestor of a future Nobel prize winner. You may find my notion of a Creator ridiculous, but clearly your theories are just a bit silly! Its just a difference of where you place your faith."

748809,nlpaintballer,2012-12-03 01:34:00,122,"I believe in evolution and my theory on why the missing link has been so hard to find is that the evidence is buried beneath silt and debris on the ocean floor.  I strongly believe that our ""ancient"" civilizations that we know of today, were actually the remnants of an advanced civilization that existed 8000+ year ago. Why did the ancients we know about build so far away from the ocean when as a race we tend to gravitate towards the coast, and in fact the largest cities today are located right next to the ocean. Not only did they build far from the coast, but they built to withstand earthquakes as well.  Why is the story of a great flood and cataclysmic event prevalent in so many ancient civilizations? Now people are discovering cities hundreds of feet beneath the ocean that carbon dating says are at least 8-10 thousand years old, which according to science shouldn't be there because we were still pretty much nomads, while the bible says the earth didn't even exist at that time.  Is it not possible that the primates we evolved from migrated and set up shop on the coastlines due to the benefits of living there, lived, died, evolved and eventually spawned a seafaring civilization that built on the coastlines all over the parts of earth that weren't covered in ice. When the end came in the form of a tsunami that wiped most of them out, the remnants went inland and mingled with the cultures who weren't as advanced. The stories of flood and cataclysm persisted to the point that when it was time to build cities again, they were built inland and earthquake resistant.  Again any evidence is buried beneath thousands of years of silt, and hundreds of feet of water, not to mention with coastal erosion any evidence would be nowhere near present day coastlines.  That's my personal theory, but I think it is plausible, far more plausible in my mind than the man in the sky or the ancient alien theories."
748811,d_paluch,2012-12-03 01:37:00,343," But same goes for religion...no? How can one believe that man and animals just randomly appeared because of a higher power? If you don't believe in evolution, that is fine, but thinking that we were just put here along with every other organism, makes just as little sense  You can believe whatever you want to believe! That is the beauty of human nature, the ability to choose and think and come up with reason. Whatever your reasoning is thats great, this thread is going nowhere"
748812,BillM,2012-12-03 01:38:00,17367,So we are from a master race of advanced (well not advanced enough to survive I guess) humans from cities that are now buried in the ocean?  I think that's as bad as someone thinking there's a single being responsible for all of mankind.

748740,Grimace,2012-12-02 23:37:00,2020,"I love how the religious, with there temples, churches, books, wars, monuments, missionaries, blasphemy laws, bigotry and everything else they shove down our throats still have the nerve to tell Atheists to keep there opinions to themselves."
748742,Christopheraaron,2012-12-02 23:42:00,3525," I have a theory, I don't know if there's any evidence of it, just an interesting idea that I had. Imagine the universe as a sphere, surrounded by one giant wormhole connected to the centre of the universe, when we get to the edge we look into the wormhole and just see the centre again, so really it has an end and is endless. Again, just an interesting way to think of it."
748743,Christopheraaron,2012-12-02 23:43:00,3525, It'll never change....

748747,Fisherman,2012-12-02 23:53:00,7201," And better yet, my gods better than your god and if that don't work, my dad can beat up your dad.  Religion, the most and best used method to use mans simple fears to keep him subservient, otherwise you might go to hell and burn forever.  What a bunch of loosers.  You die, you rot and return to the basic elements."
748748,woodenboater,2012-12-02 23:56:00,2277,I get headaches just trying to contemplate this very question and end up not having a clue and feeling like mankind is very insignificant when viewed against the entirety of what is out there. Kinda like how Marvin feels in Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy...sorta
748752,Rich Nelson,2012-12-03 00:00:00,332," Im not sure what you are refering to here, but it has nothing to do with the discussion here about evolution or bigfoot. If you actually have something to add, then feel free."
748754,Rich Nelson,2012-12-03 00:06:00,332," Id watch what you say there Fisherman. Just because you dont agree with it makes everyone who is religious a ""looser"" ? You die, you rot, and return to the basic elements. And how can u possibly know that? What if the "" religoius loosers"" are right? Where would that leave you?"

748757,Christopheraaron,2012-12-03 00:08:00,3525," That one is good too, what really baffles me is thinking about time, which is relative, but the thought that nothing ever ""started"" but was always there, makes you feel small."
748761,Rich Nelson,2012-12-03 00:14:00,332," Thats not my understanding of the physical world. Sounds ridiculous right? Thats because it is. Makes about as much sense as the big bang theory. And I can say the exact same thing to you about my education, or parents teaching. Id rather be the guy that "" believes"" in something that makes sense, as oppossed to being taught some far fetched story about a big bang.  Interesting how everyone keeps beating around the bush and changing the topic. Care to prove my points about evolution wrong, or have I made my point? And what exactly was this big explosion at the ""beginning"" anyway?  If nothing is there, than nothing can explode. You made the post about 6000 years being a joke, so lets hear your theory."
748763,nlpaintballer,2012-12-03 00:16:00,122,"Caged Wisdom taught me that faith is fact......oh wait a minute, that was on the blooper reel.  If we are to believe everything in the Bible as the word of God, and not the words of priests who just wanted to control the masses, then why don't we all own slaves that we can beat so badly that they die after a couple days. That it's okay so long as they don't die right away, since they are the property of the person beating them.  I don't think Buddy Christ would think much of that.   Christopher is 100% correct about why religion started in the first place, to explain the unknown, paganism especially. The irony is that Christians considered paganism barbaric because of all the blood rituals, yet Christians eat the body of Christ and drink his blood every Sunday.  I don't think science is infallible. Theories are proven and refuted every day because they are theories. To believe a story that was first recorded a few thousand years ago and to accept every word as the gospel truth, than you are not thinking for yourself, instead you are blindly following the leader. Bill, I'm agnostic and I would like you to not post pictures of my God online."
748764,Fisherman,2012-12-03 00:18:00,7201,"Okay, I achieved my point, if you don't agree with some form of religion then there's something wrong,(according to those that believe) it goes both ways. I suppose I could have used a different description.  Last time I looked when a grave was dug up, it was pretty much rotten remains with nature having had lunch on the deceased.  Where would that leave me? I don't believe in wasting space in cemetaries either, going through the burner and making some ash for the  plants to grow."
748767,Christopheraaron,2012-12-03 00:24:00,3525, LOL! I want to hear his answer.
748768,Rich,2012-12-03 00:24:00,3927, The topic at the start was a tv show about finding a mythical creature.. Just sayin

748772,SirCranksalot,2012-12-03 00:29:00,3291, Time flies like an arrow. Fruit flies like a banana. There---that makes as much sense as some of the arguments being made here!!

748776,Rich Nelson,2012-12-03 00:39:00,332,Lol. I wanna hear your answer! And reasoning.
748638,Christopheraaron,2012-12-02 18:31:00,3525,"^^Is sand or air not physical? If a bomb goes off in a city still nothing is destroyed, If a building falls to the ground are the windows, cement, and rebar not still there? The building is still there, just in a different form."
748639,Rich Nelson,2012-12-02 18:32:00,332,"Yes, ive heard of carbon dating. It was invented in 1949. The theory that the earth is billions of years old has been around since the 1830s ( only based on evolution in the 1830s, with no technology or science backing it. So why in the 1830s did they think billions of years was no carbon dating to support the theory?  Because they needed billions of years to hide behind or the theory of evolution would sound ridiculous..."
748641,fishing n autograph,2012-12-02 18:34:00,2540,Yes winternet has started
748645,Rich Nelson,2012-12-02 18:36:00,332,"So if we leave the pile of rebar , cement  and windows long enough, eventually it can rebuild itself, or turn into something better even. Ya, that seems logical and theres evidence of it happening all the time., Cmon.. Really? You cant actually admit that thats possible can you?"
748650,Christopheraaron,2012-12-02 18:55:00,3525," Well, over millions of years the windows would get ground up, the cement would crumble and even the rebar over time would deteriorate, it may take billions of years but eventually it would get turned into the centre of the earth again, melt and maybe come back up as new rock. No it would not become a building again, but WE made that building, it never just appeared."
748653,woodenboater,2012-12-02 19:06:00,2277,"There was this show I saw a few times, something about what happens to civilizations and buildings esp, if man were out of the picture and time and nature had at the structures man had made. Like Christopher said, EVERYTHING would eventually return to the earth. The timeline would make our lives seem like a speck of dirt but it would happen.  All this will be pointless after Dec 21"
748655,Christopheraaron,2012-12-02 19:09:00,3525, LOL!
748658,Rich Nelson,2012-12-02 19:18:00,332,"I agree that all man man structures would eventually ""dissappear over time""  but the evolution theory sais that that things appear and evolve over time. Thats a bit contradictory..."
748664,Christopheraaron,2012-12-02 19:28:00,3525,"Actually I believe that it's religion that says that things ""appear"". Evolution says that things change as they need to, just as if you need a pencil you'll go get one, right?"
748665,i2cool2fool,2012-12-02 19:30:00,349,"I have seen ""I Dream of Jeannie"" and am confused. I thought everyone knew the creation of the universe stemmed from magic and witchcraft.  That sounds ludicrous.  I will self impose punishment for adding to the ridiculousness of winternet. Off the the garage!"
748685,Rich Nelson,2012-12-02 20:46:00,332,"So things change as they need to all on their own?  Why is it that these days, the average life expectancy is far less than what it used to be? If natural selection only lets the strong survive, then we should all live to be hundreds if not thoasands of years old. Why arent we adapting to be superhumans? Still no scientific evidence supporting the theory. 1. The universe could not create itself out of nothing. ( logically speaking, from nothing comes nothing) 2. The law of thermodynamics tells us that a system will ALWAYS go from order to disorder unless there is a plan or outside intelligence to organize it. 3. Living things NEVER arise from non - living things. Evolution requires living things to come from nonliving, and this has never even been observed. 4.Complex systems do not evolve ""bit by bit"". "" Its absurd to think that a complex organ like the human eye could be formed through natural processes."" Charles Darwin ( even he realized how ridiculous the theory was. 5. Missing links are still missing.  If evolution were true, there should be millions of intermediate fossil organisms present in the earth and the fossil record. For some odd reason, not one has ever been found ( or proven) 6. Mutations are contrary to Evolution. Natural selection cannot produce evolution, because its impossible to produce new genetic material. 7. Probability facts are contrary to Evolution. "" the chance that life forms might have emerged this way ( time and chance) is comparable with the chance that a tornado sweeping through a junkyard might assemble a Boeing 747 from the materials therin"". (Evolutionist Sir Fred Hoyle)  With all of todays technology, scientist cant find any crossover DNA? Eg no DNA of a mouse in a rabbit etc. Even if you dont look at the scientific evidence, the entire theory is insane and absurd, and goes against any sort of logic and order."
748687,SirCranksalot,2012-12-02 20:51:00,3291,Unlike creationism------
748689,Christopheraaron,2012-12-02 20:58:00,3525," You hid it on the nose Knuguy. Creationism is the most absurd of the explanations, also assuming that your theory is correct, how did everything start? A beam of light shined down and everything appeared?"
748692,woodenboater,2012-12-02 21:10:00,2277,Don't forget Intelligent Design as a way to make Creationism look more palatable.  No disrespect to those who believe we were created by an omnipotent being but I'd sooner believe that earth and it's inhabitants are a petrie dish experiment by another more intelligent form of life.
748695,Christopheraaron,2012-12-02 21:14:00,3525," I often imagine that, lol!"
748697,Rich Nelson,2012-12-02 21:16:00,332," I respect your opinion. And I also see how it sounds absurd. Im not going to post how I believe it all happened, because you already know the basics. ( i dont really need this to turn into a religion bashing seminar, which is what creationism is based on. Evolution is a theory, not a religion. If there are flaws in the Creation theory, then feel free to point them out. Im not a scientist, or Theologin, but I was given common sense, and the ability to reason.  Take one small piece of the human body (eyes, fingers, etc anything) and see how intricate and complex they are. To think that they just became that way on their own as a result of some explosion... Well you know the drill. Im not expecting you to agree with me ( but I know there are more on the site that do). I think good discussion is healthy, ( and entertaining) Instead of just chiming in to say that Creationism is absurd, maybe you would like to look at my list of evolution myths, and point out where Im wrong...."
748698,Spiel,2012-12-02 21:26:00,9065,"Religion was created by man, not by God (any God) and a difference of religious beliefs has been (still is)  fodder for the most destructive/violent acts against mankind on the planet!  Of course that's just an opinion."

748706,Rich Nelson,2012-12-02 22:08:00,332,"The statement that Religion ( generalizing them all together) was created by man, is only a matter of opinion as Spiel stated. I agree with the rest."

For example Zeus was CREATED to explain things like lightning, but we now know the reason for lightning so there is no need for him anymore. One thing religion is exceedingly good at is teaching, not necessarily what it teaches but the methods used to teach are very, very effective."

748453,nlpaintballer,2012-12-02 03:21:00,122,"I saw a cougar when I was in 4th grade, on our farm near Guelph. I was teased like you wouldn't believe, and no one believed me, not even my parents. That changed the following winter when our neighbor was walking through the bush and came across some big cat tacks in the snow.  He followed them for a while to see if he could get a visual on the cat that was making them. After following them for a good half hour or so he ended up back on his original trail, with fresh tracks on top of his. He realized what was going on, turned around and headed home as fast as he could while looking over his shoulder.  Also we lost a few sheep that year with no trace found, which rarely happens with coyote/coydog kills.  A couple years later the livestock losses were so high in the area that the ministry sent 5 trappers to our farm, 3 of them were from the U.S. They had several traps broken by large predators, but managed to trap and kill just over 80 coyotes/coydogs in a 9 mile radius around our farm.

748503,Rich Nelson,2012-12-02 13:07:00,332,"Im guessing this will go in circles. But there is no proof that universe is millions of years old, or evolved on its own. ( just because a scientist claims something to be millions of years old without proof, doesnt make it true)  I realize also that their is no scientific proof that the universe is 6000 years old, or created by a higher power.  What scientists have proved so far, is that they havent found life outside of earth, so why is there anyreason to believe otherwise.(and why waste millions looking for something that isnt there?) The theory of the "" Big Bang""  just seems ludacris to me.  One tiny neutron exploding, and eventually turning into the amazing world we live in today?  I dont think so.  When has an explosion ever ""created"" something as opposed to destroy something. If someone had a pile of wood , bricks, drywall, paint etc laying in a pile, and asked you if you believed they could turn it into a completed house by blowing up the materials with dynamite...What would you say?  Obviously its impossible for that to happen, and you can agree with that. But you believe that the universe (which is billions of times more intricate and complex)  could evolve that way. Doesnt really bother me what you believe, fact is lots havent really givin it much thought.  I know its not going to change opinions, because a lot will "" stick to their guns"" without even paying attention to the ridiculous things they are saying."

748571,Christopheraaron,2012-12-02 16:07:00,3525," Explosions NEVER destroy anything, that may seem a little weird but when you think about it it makes sense. An explosion is nothing more then a rapid release of energy, and depending on how well you did in science you know that energy can never be destroyed, just transferred to other objects. Here's an example, when a bomb goes off in a desert the energy is quickly released onto the sand, the sand is then heated and a crude form of glass is created, then the energy would simply spread apart into the atmosphere until we couldn't notice it anymore, nothing was destroyed, states of matter were briefly changed but everything that was there is still there. Explosions can also combine or break up molecules, to become new things, so a very large explosion involving oxygen and hydrogen has a chance of becoming water, and a very large explosion involving water could break it up turning it to it's original states. I cannot explain everything in the universe, no one can, and I may not be explaining this correctly but you get the gist."

747713,registerfly,2012-11-29 14:28:00,198," mathematical or not, I personally don't understand why we as a life form are looking so hard for ""life"" as we know it elsewhere in the universe. I mean aside from unexplored regions of say our oceans to explore, whats to say that ""life"" can't take up some other makeup to be viable that is totally foreign to us?  I mean we see it in science all the time of organisms evolving to suit it's environment, and humans do as well to adapt. So why not have a life form elsewhere that has adapted and evolved to live in their specific part of the universe that doesn't rely on what we need to live?"
747940,Rich,2012-11-30 13:38:00,3927,Indeed. Assuming an alien life form requires oxygen or water is based on the theory that we all had the same creator.
748032,blaque,2012-11-30 17:59:00,2419," I dont know if thats what hes saying......but it sure as heck is what i'm sayin!!  Im perfectly fine walking around thinking theres no such thing as aliens, squatches, werewolves, vampires......Oblivion is bliss as far as im concerned in this case"
748054,fishing n autograph,2012-11-30 18:31:00,2540,i've seen samsquatch...or maybe it was a hair woman from Keswick in flannel...
748058,Rich Clemens,2012-11-30 18:37:00,3131,I'm still looking for the fishing related stuff in here (Dang - Gave into temptation yet again)
748061,fishing n autograph,2012-11-30 18:42:00,2540,not enough ice to fish yet....winternet is coming  only 116 days till opening day (baseball)
748066,doubleheader,2012-11-30 18:56:00,497,"Have to chime in here. I must admit I'm drawn to the unknown. Having watched a couple episodes of the Sasquatch show however, all i can say is it is just silly, good for a laugh but nothing else. I would love it, however, if someone scared the bejesus out of them by running thru the woods at them near nightfall in a Squatch suit.......... and watch them fill their pants. The UFO stuff though I must admit, I think there is something to that stuff. The episode where they talk about the UFO's at the base in the UK and the incidents in the skies over Arizona??? Makes me wonder, even the Governor of Arizona says he saw something."
748067,fishing n autograph,2012-11-30 19:00:00,2540,I prefer Ghost Hunters at least they go in and try to debunk everything before they say it's paranormal
746822,ehg,2012-11-26 19:22:00,2666,"Seems that there is a lot of sightings of Bigfoot in the United States. This show has a crew going around too town meetings in Kentucky, Michigan, Illinois, New Jersey, etc... where hundreds of people are speaking of their encounters with some big hairy beast. The crew would then go to sighting locations and try to locate or entice a Sasquatch into showing itself. Usually it would be a small patch of woods at the end of some farmers field. The experts would declare the area as having a 'squatchy' feel. They would do yells or bang sticks on trees hoping for a reply. Sometimes they would hear something afterwards like a coyote or something and get excited and declare ""thats a 'squatch"" It's funny how money is infested in this but makes me wonder if anyone has been creeped out by something in our truly vast wilderness here in Ontario. I remember being in Algonquin many years ago with a gf and heard the freakiest calls and such. Turned out to be a Barred Owl. Heard a huge crash and thud in forest near tent but turned out to be a tree falling. Anyone have a 'squatchy story. Thought folks here might due to being out in the woods hunting and fishing a lot. http://www.bfro.net/GDB/show_county_reports.asp?state=ca-on"

746837,lookinforwalleye,2012-11-26 19:59:00,4399,I am embarrassed to admit I did watch a episode...and while I am at it I will also admit to watching a episode of hillbilly handfishing and duck dynasty

746857,MJL,2012-11-26 20:34:00,2427,"Back in August of 2006, I was paddling along the shoreline of one small lake in Algonquin Park and could’ve sworn I saw bigfoot. Upon closer inspection, it turned out to be a portly and quite hairy dude celebrating his 45th birthday in his birthday suit...I knew something wasn’t right when he asked me how my day went...I probably should’ve taken notice of the can of Heineken that he was drinking before paddling closer to investigate..."

Never saw it or heard it after that. I figure it was s a bear, but it sure got me thinking.....maybe a... sasq...u ..atch....??"
746912,ehg,2012-11-26 22:17:00,2666,That is a traumatic and scary story. You are lucky to get away. Lots of strange creatures up in the north as well.
746915,ehg,2012-11-26 22:21:00,2666, Bet more people share that experience more than they care to admit.
746929,bare foot wader,2012-11-26 22:43:00,1354,"that show is a joke, but I still watch it...everybody has their endulgances ha  I have a friend who claims he had a bigfoot encounter, has a few pictures on his iphone and of course all crappy pics, but swears it was not a bear  my creepy most memorable experiences are:  I found a very fresh fawn carcass in a tree while steelheading an erie trib one fall, very fresh as in blood still dripping   I rowed my pontoon boat to shore to fire out a duke...it was a late spring morning, cold air but sunny and I had found an unusually comfortable seat over a downed tree, sitting in the sun, life was good and needless to say I was making the most of the moment, it's a pain in the ass to row to shore and strip down waders......after a few minutes of joy, I happened to look over and sitting on his ass about 40 yds away was a black wolf, staring at me with that stupid look dogs give you  we made direct eye contact for about 5 seconds and then I decided to wrap things up asap...as I paddled out from shore, not even past the reeds along shore yet, the wolf came running in, a couple of sniffs and then ate it all up right in front of me, looked straight at me and then ran off"

746950,kickingfrog,2012-11-26 23:22:00,8333,    First time I was ever camping alone and I was woken by a ridiculously large animal around my tent and campsite. After realizing it wasn't going away any time soon I decided to unzip and take a look. Those two racoons never knew what hit them when I threw my boot at 'em.
746951,MJL,2012-11-26 23:27:00,2427," It’s more of a public service to those that are on the hunt for bigfoot...Take note, not all things that are bi-pedal, large, hairy and naked are sasquatches..."
746954,nancur373,2012-11-26 23:30:00,1211,The way I see it. If one is ever found it will be broadcast all over the world. Can't believe how they try to make it seem as if they are going to get definitive proof at by the end of every episode. That being said...I do watch it...with my 5 year old.
746959,kickingfrog,2012-11-26 23:48:00,8333, I'll wager none of them are.
