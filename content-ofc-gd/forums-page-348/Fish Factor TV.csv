748580,Sinker,2012-12-02 16:30:00,8692,"I must be missing something. The video I just watched was great, I enjoyed it, but there were no muskies involved. How do I get to the musky vid?  Anyways, the gill netting video was great. Very interesting, indeed. Keep them coming. I enjoy this type of thing over an actual fishing show any day.  Good stuff, Marc. Keep them coming!  S."
