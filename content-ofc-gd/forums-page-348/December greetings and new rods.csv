Down here the Oranges and Lemons are ripening! Soon we will have to make gallons off citrus drinks, just to get rid of them. Thank goodness Smirnoff's is only $10.00 a bottle...Wink.  I continue to wrap rods and I'm still in love with the Tiger Wrap. Here are my latest efforts.  Crank-bait in Orange  Detail...    Casting in Green: This rod was built last year, but I recently added a Tiger wrap to dress it up.  Detail...   Crank-bait in Brown:  Detail...   Spinning in Blue and Yellow:  Detail:   This is a new San Francisco Giants themed rod:(Note ripening Lemons in background.)  Detail of front end...  Detail rear grip...   On the SF Giants rod and on the Blue/Yellow I wasn't happy with the way the orange, white and yellow thread darkened, when wound onto a charcoal coloured blank.  I used Colour Preserver, but when the finish dried, the orange had darkened, the whites had a gray cast and the yellow looked slightly green.  To keep the whites ""clean"" and allow the other light colours to retain their original shades, I sprayed the areas that would have light coloured thread with flat white primer...This cured the problem.  Happy Holiday's Garry2R's"
