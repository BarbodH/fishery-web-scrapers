749175,Jer,2012-12-04 13:55:00,1426,"Just to keep the OFC cops happy   , the offending pic has now been removed from the ad."
749176,outllaw,2012-12-04 14:00:00,1232,wow. i am glad theres no vigilanty justice here. talk about internet cowboys.. a waste of goverment resources
749183,richyb,2012-12-04 14:34:00,774,Nothing better than calling the authoirties on someone that you have no clue when the pic was taken you just assume that he was poaching so now he has to be investigated. The day before halloween some girl my wife knows called the cops on a guy because he bought all of the disposable razors at a dollar store. She FIGURED that he was going to go home and stick the blades in candies to hand out. Poor guy was likely donating them to the homeless shelter or something innocent but gets a call from the cops instead.
749186,bdox,2012-12-04 14:44:00,329,"it's no surprise that a musky zealot would want to add ""internet conservation officer"" to his title"
749202,BillM,2012-12-04 16:04:00,17367," Safety razor blades are still super cheap, been using one for years.  So much better then that Mach3 Bull!  Although ya, that's kinda funny, lol!"
749205,SirCranksalot,2012-12-04 16:28:00,3291," The same blade?? Yeah, that's super cheap!"
749206,big guy,2012-12-04 16:31:00,414,"Well I think we all would like to have twins for girlfriends or even just a one-nighter, but man, they are the butt ugliest twins I've ever seen. Not sure why the guy has a smile on his face."
749214,BillM,2012-12-04 17:05:00,17367, LOL!..  I can get a 100 pack for under $20 shipped to my door..  That lasts a looong time!
748575,woodenboater,2012-12-02 16:19:00,2277,ad is gone...
748578,SirCranksalot,2012-12-02 16:28:00,3291,It's legal to keep sturgeon in some parts of Ont---don't have the regs right now so can't tell you what part(s).
748581,Christopheraaron,2012-12-02 16:32:00,3525," I have them in front of me, You can target them in some parts, but never keep. Unless you're native which doesn't make any sense."

748583,TDunn,2012-12-02 16:33:00,680, Yup I caught a few flipping jigs this summer. Mean buggers!
748584,Gerritt,2012-12-02 16:35:00,6129, Probably from all the backlash they are taking... seeing this posted on other forums as well....   G
748589,Gerritt,2012-12-02 16:43:00,6129,
748593,bushart,2012-12-02 16:48:00,2628,Pretty sure all Ontario is no keep or target on Sturgeon
748599,Christopheraaron,2012-12-02 17:04:00,3525," I'm seeing that you can target but not keep in zones 1, 2, 3, and 8."
748621,gaspumper,2012-12-02 17:52:00,393,Still there at 12:50pm.
748682,esoxansteel,2012-12-02 20:33:00,1307,"Look at me, and i dont look Native either, but you wouldnt want to bet on it, or you would lose your bet, same as the guy at the exibitions who could guess your weight within 5 pounds, i use to beat him or her everytime as well, you cant judge a person by his looks although its fun trying i guess.   Migweetch"
748684,BillM,2012-12-02 20:43:00,17367,Time to call the TIPS line
748686,woodenboater,2012-12-02 20:46:00,2277,"ah, back up. wonder if it was down cuz of traffic"
748775,funfishing,2012-12-03 00:39:00,147,"The only thing I see wrong with that ad is that lady holding the pike, should be the one laying down in the sturgeon pic, instead of the guy!  I don't see how anyone could assume that he is NOT native? Definitely looks native..."
748778,irishfield,2012-12-03 00:43:00,26272,"Well the guy sure got what he wanted....and then some. Can't imagine the extra hits his advert has got, looks like a nice place to hang a hat. $299k doesn't buy much below North Bay... it'll be gone in short time.  I also see poor channel seperation with his stereo and the speakers that close together..."
748789,BillM,2012-12-03 01:00:00,17367, Are you blind or just being sarcastic?
748840,funfishing,2012-12-03 02:19:00,147," I made 2 points; that the lady is attractive, and that the dude looks native. Both seem pretty clear.  Which of those is leading you to believe that I am blind or sarcastic?"
748843,woodenboater,2012-12-03 02:25:00,2277,"While it can be hard to actually say who is First Nation today, I don't believe this man is, I'd bet he's Euro. As well, in all the reserves I've been to, I have never seen a kid with serious brows like that kid in the photo. That screams caucasian to me.  And as Wayne noted, this property looks like a good price on a nice lake."
748851,funfishing,2012-12-03 02:45:00,147,"From what I read on the Niagara Forum, the no catch limit for sturgeons was only implemented a few years ago, and the guy said he took the pic beforehand. So even if he isn't native, it wasn't illegal."
748887,BillM,2012-12-03 04:22:00,17367, The fact you think he's native.
748896,Bob,2012-12-03 05:29:00,370,"I lived on that system for some years and my sister is general manager at a popular tourist camp on the system. I never heard of anyone taking a sturgeon there and as stated above, it could be an old picture and maybe they were legal at the time. Below the dam that forms Dollars Lake, it wouldn't surprise me to find a sturgeon but I never heard tell of them above the dam. I did catch my first bowfin in that system but quite a piece upstream from Dollars. No obstacles so I would assume they're all over in there."
748909,Rich,2012-12-03 11:06:00,3927,A lady at work was telling me how great the sturgeon fishing was at her cottage. So big and tasty. I told her next time she goes up look for the MNR cuz its illegal. She insisted her limit was 5. Lol. I told her next time she goes up I'll call a CO to confirm her interpretation of the regs. She never mentioned it again. Lol
749102,Pigeontroller,2012-12-04 00:44:00,2793,"I recieved a reply from the OMNR, that consider the pics to be 'old' and taken when Sturgeon wasn't a closed species...I guess thats the easiest way to deal with it..."
749110,whiskywizard,2012-12-04 01:14:00,305," Hmmm...  The guy in the photos is wearing a Telus hat. Telus didn't exist before 1990, and even then was only out West. I'd say the pics are 2000 or later."
749117,Pigeontroller,2012-12-04 01:53:00,2793,"Apparently they are investigating, meaning that guy has likely recieved a call from the OMNR...Sturgeon was closed in july 2008."

748497,Gerritt,2012-12-02 12:36:00,6129,Guess you missed the two dead sturgeon on the dock.... when you are not allowed to keep sturgeon in this FMZ..
748498,bushart,2012-12-02 12:37:00,2628,Looks ok cept for the ole no catch in Ontario Sturgeon rule---ooopppss  Guess he can go the full Ford and say he was not aware about seasons
748499,davey buoy,2012-12-02 12:40:00,5505," I saw it,didn't want to stir the pot. Not much you can do now?. I think 98% of the people would know this! IMO."
748501,Terry,2012-12-02 12:55:00,14456,"but they were legal to catch at one time....lol I thought it was because they wanted 300,000.00 for a cottage in the middle of nowhere in the legend boat commercial they talk about snagging a 5 ft sturgeon and only released it because no one wanted to clean it "
748504,bushart,2012-12-02 13:08:00,2628,Years ago I had smoked sturgeon---may very well have been the best smoked fish I ever had
748506,davey buoy,2012-12-02 13:13:00,5505, And Isn't the roe one of the best caviar?
748509,bushart,2012-12-02 13:20:00,2628, Like snails---can't do the fish eggs
748510,Terry,2012-12-02 13:20:00,14456, I smoked cigarettes and thought that was silly and gave it up
748512,moxie,2012-12-02 13:28:00,1566,How did he get those Sturgeon to lie still long enough to take that pic?
748513,davey buoy,2012-12-02 13:30:00,5505," Terry,Terry,:rofl2:lol."
748524,Rod Caster,2012-12-02 13:59:00,5784,"maybe they are native..??  The other thing that seems wrong is the bowfin....I've never heard of bowfins that far north. Also, I know a couple people in that area and i've never heard of anyone getting bowfin."
748527,outllaw,2012-12-02 14:21:00,1232,tryed them once. there to hard to light for smokin.
748533,vance,2012-12-02 14:50:00,719,Rod Caster I used to fish that area regularly for 20 years and we always caught bowfin but i have never seen a sturgeon or heard of anyone catching them.  vance
748536,Rod Caster,2012-12-02 14:54:00,5784, hmmm I didnt' know bowfins were that far north. Thanks for input.
748538,Pigeontroller,2012-12-02 15:02:00,2793,Link forwarded to OMNR CO.
748545,DRIFTER_016,2012-12-02 15:29:00,10439,"  Yep, dude looks native or metis to me. Fish may even have been netted."
748550,Steve,2012-12-02 15:36:00,2075,we have caught bowfin as high as the sault.  they are up there.
748551,Christopheraaron,2012-12-02 15:36:00,3525,Even if he's native it isn't good for him to be promoting fishing for them...
748556,Gerritt,2012-12-02 15:45:00,6129,"Given this fellows grasp of the english language, I would say he is NON-Native, and born elsewhere.  He actively promotes sturgeon fishing on his website.  Taken from his site ""World class fishing and hunting in the aria for Pike, Bass, Walleye, Sturgeon""  with additional pictures of him with Sturgeon...  Even if he was a native... he should not be promoting this sort of behavior."
748560,Sinker,2012-12-02 15:49:00,8692,"Wow....not only sturgeon, but DEAD sturgeon. Nice.  Its amazing what people can get away with. I don't have the balls to even try it. My fishing/hunting license is worth waaaaaaaaaaaay more to me than a couple fish/birds/mammals.  S."
748565,NAW,2012-12-02 15:53:00,4022,Brutal.  Not to sure what to say. Hopefully this guy gets straightened out.
748566,DRIFTER_016,2012-12-02 15:54:00,10439,Well if he's not native then I say fry his
748570,Moosebunk,2012-12-02 16:04:00,3970,"It's OK to poach sturgeon and post pics about it, as long as you're using it to sell experience or product."
