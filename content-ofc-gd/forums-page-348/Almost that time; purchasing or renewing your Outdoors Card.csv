743997,kickingfrog,2012-11-14 17:55:00,8333,Thanks for the reminder. I've been meaning to check and see if I'm do to renew.
744009,NAW,2012-11-14 18:37:00,4022,Got a 3 year last year.  Remind me again in 2 years
744011,phatpelkey,2012-11-14 18:46:00,78,same here lol
744014,GBW,2012-11-14 18:58:00,8460,I always get a 3-year so when 2012 comes to an end I need to get it again...
744034,lew,2012-11-14 19:39:00,12766,Government says I'm an old dood now and let's me fish for free
744042,kickingfrog,2012-11-14 19:48:00,8333,How'd you get that boat and two ton towwer for free?
744046,jedimaster,2012-11-14 19:56:00,3472,"Mine expires for me, I'll be doing a 3 year. If I die in say year 1 for some unknown reason can my estate get a refund of the remaining years? And will they mail me 3 yellow cards, one for each year. haha"
744054,lew,2012-11-14 20:09:00,12766, Even old doods have to pay for SOME things
744057,woodenboater,2012-11-14 20:12:00,2277," guess that's something to look forward to besides cheaper camping fees at provincial parks  question though, which set of limits would apply in your case Lew ?  suppose I could dig out the regs myself"
744062,lew,2012-11-14 20:20:00,12766," I don't really worry about the limits too much as I don't keep many fish, just a few big muskies each year for the BBQ spit"
744068,kickingfrog,2012-11-14 20:36:00,8333," Sport fishing licence limits.   Just checked, I'm still good for 1 more year."
744096,misfish,2012-11-14 21:25:00,29133,  :rofl2:  :rofl2:    Old fart.
744116,gaspumper,2012-11-14 22:37:00,393,But if you are an old dood like me and like to hunt you still have to renew your card .
744168,Whopper,2012-11-15 00:49:00,2174,"    It was nice for me this year being a nonresident, did my renewal for both the outdoor card and license online. Even got checked on one of my trips and out of the two CO's one didn't even know what I handed him"
744306,adempsey,2012-11-15 18:19:00,1498,You sure it's on November 26th?  I emailed them recently and the response said December. 
748979,adempsey,2012-12-03 16:17:00,1498,"OK, renewed my license today.  I did it online.  It never ceases to amaze me at how badly the government implements their websites.   Who makes these decisions?  I've been using computers since the advent of the dial-up modem.  However, I still have trouble navigating these bloated and illogical government websites.  Every so-called ""improvement"" is usually 10 steps backwards as well.    The license renewal process falls into that category IMO.  Anyway, /rant off..."
749101,irishfield,2012-12-04 00:40:00,26272,Just did mine... amazed it actually worked so IMHO a big step up from the last decade that wouldn't allow anyone with an apostrophe in their name to renew online.  Almost thought I was getting a one year licence... but when I took my head out of my    and read the page. You have to select your outdoors card first and put it in the cart... then it gives you the choice of 3 year or 1 year Sport or Conservation licences. Found it painless... other than the $94.67!
749144,Nipfisher,2012-12-04 03:57:00,2449,  Over $160 for me with the 3 year fishing and small game stickers on it.
749145,jedimaster,2012-12-04 04:00:00,3472, x2
749282,lookinforwalleye,2012-12-04 22:18:00,4399, Yes Wayne but don't you feel better knowing that the 94.67 is going to support the resource!
749287,irishfield,2012-12-04 22:29:00,26272,"  Yah ... but in the grand scheme of things, it's the best thirty buck per year I spend!"
749293,MCTFisher9120,2012-12-04 22:36:00,3761,"On the 19th we can start issuing the fishing licenses for 2013 at our shop. We got a letter from the MNR with that info, prices went up a tad..84.99 for 3yr sport is what im after..card is still under $10 for the renew.  Doing it online sucks, although I haven't done so myself I have had to fix the many many problems that the online way made for fokes across ontario. hope the system is problem free next year, such a stress when trying to serve customers."
749294,irishfield,2012-12-04 22:37:00,26272, Why.. it took me 4 minutes!
