748472,rippinlipsfishingteam,2012-12-02 05:42:00,76,Well I know the season isn't even over yet hahaha... but I had to wade through enough footage as it was from this season.  Just wanted to say thank you to everyone I fished with this year.... I learned something everytime I went out (even if it was 'what NOT to do' haha)  All I can say as that we are lucky in southern Ontario to have this at our fingertips !  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Ng2Qb5gDpo&feature=youtu.be
