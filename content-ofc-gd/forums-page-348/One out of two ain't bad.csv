748787,ChrisK,2012-12-03 00:58:00,2772,Saturday was a great day with many fish and Sunday was a total blow out. Saturday all our fish came on my hybrid stones after the sun peaked through the cloud cover and warmer temps brought on the afternoon bite. Fast and furious action for three hours with fish after fish after fish. Wish I had more pics to show you guys but my partner and I were on opposite sides of the river making it impossible to take pics and who wants to stop fishing even for a couple minutes when the bite is on !  This is the last fish of the day. My partner Devon was tuckered out sitting on the bank waiting for me to call it when this big fella decided to have a go at my fly. Rosy red cheeks and all dressed up for a night out on the town. Ain't he a perdy !    Cheers !
