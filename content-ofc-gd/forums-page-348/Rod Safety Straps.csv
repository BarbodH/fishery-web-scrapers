I haven't used this type of tube rod holder before and was wondering if it would be a good idea to strap the rod and reel to the holder while trolling and travelling in rough water. There are commercial straps available, I was just wondering what others may use for this purpose. Thank you, Andy."

I'll have to try that, never know when that salmon is going to give an extra tug.  Saw it once at the Kemble tower in Owen Sound,  Pffft, there goes buddies rod out of the holder,  never heard so many uncatholic words in my virgin ears."
749292,irishfield,2012-12-04 22:35:00,26272,We lost one of Lloyd's rods on the BOQ last week... but we won the lottery and hooked the line with the next rod's bait on the same planner board side and reeled it back in.
749297,Roy,2012-12-04 22:58:00,13728, That's just one of Lloyd's trick shots. Took him 2 months to perfect it. Did you see the rod eject spring at the bottom of the rocket launcher?
749298,irishfield,2012-12-04 23:00:00,26272,"  LOL Roy.. but it was me that caught it, so I guess it's just a practice session thing!"
