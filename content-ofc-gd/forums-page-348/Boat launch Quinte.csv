748717,fishindevil,2012-12-02 22:43:00,6254,Yes off quick short road a few miles south of the bridge across the narrows it's not the best and water is very low if you don't have a big boat and ya got a 4x4 I used to launch there a lot years ago !!!

If you launch at Desronto, you're only five to ten minutes away from Short Road - watch out for the marker at Desronto, it's a killer rock - Ask Young One.....  Lotsa Luck  David  aka  Superdad"

Can you still get a boat in at huffs?? Another great spot !!! Ahhhh the good old days .....
