748906,Marc Thorpe,2012-12-03 10:07:00,621,well done guys
748966,Jds63,2012-12-03 15:28:00,1365,wow ! must be nice to drive around and catch walleyes like that ... LOL
748974,Rod Caster,2012-12-03 16:02:00,5784,"  Nipissing can be like that when the bite is on. Honestly, it's still my favorite place to fish just because I can drive around on safe (at least I consider it) ice and the snow cover is typically blow away due to the lakes' size. Winter please!!!"
