748688,bushart,2012-12-02 20:54:00,2628,So a group of us caught Neil last week in Ottawa---I think I'm a little more deaf now---great concert though  Anyway--the wife liked the silhoette image of Cray Horse that they flew behind the stage---and asked for a version  Now I have'nt did a silhoette for many moons---this was kinda fun---get my hand back in the paints also  Neils' of course was a charging Crazy Horse on horseback---so I kept that theme  16 x 20  
748713,Leecher,2012-12-02 22:34:00,7832, Been a while since I've seen your work Terrence and looks like you haven't lost your touch   Great work  as always
748721,bushart,2012-12-02 22:49:00,2628,Thanks Jacques  Did you get your deer this year?
748727,mercman,2012-12-02 23:04:00,7054,"You captured the essence of that charge Perfectly Bushy !!! As always, may i add."
748736,Leecher,2012-12-02 23:25:00,7832, Our group got a 4 pointer but I wasn't the shooter   Just got back from getting the meat and it's in the freezer now
748751,bushart,2012-12-02 23:58:00,2628,Thanks Merky---I kept the brushstrokes loose and it was fun---sometimes the less rigid the better it works  Was hard not goin for detail but I made er    Right on Jacques---I heard of a few gangs had hard times this year---seems if you had acorns---you were good
748758,Steve,2012-12-03 00:12:00,2075,son of a gun - that's amazing.  i was fortunate enough to catch a few of his shows from this past tour - the man never stops!  thanks for posting that.
748766,Live2fish85,2012-12-03 00:22:00,1633,"Damn you are lucky. I would love to see that show.  As for the painting. That is awesome, you are one hell of an artist."

748790,bushart,2012-12-03 01:01:00,2628,Thanks Steve and Live 2 fish  Yeah I've been a Neil fan for a long time and yes he has more energy than me and he's 67  Ottawa was the last Canadian show---most shows he was doin 90'ish mins  Ottawa he did 147 minutes---it was great  Re: the painting-----Years ago my buddy picked me up a painting on sandstone done on a roadside by a Native artist in Nevada---it was a silohouette of native riders---I kind of liked that since then--although have'nt gone there for some years---memory lane
748795,bushart,2012-12-03 01:04:00,2628,Right on Jacques----actually in this area there is a lot of oak trees with those acorns---bringin them in
748852,fishdawg,2012-12-03 02:47:00,912,"a Neil concert is high on my bucket list,,,  kicking myself for not making it happen this time around with Crazy Horse"
748855,Sinker,2012-12-03 02:52:00,8692,Keep on rockin Bushart!  Neil is one of my all time fav's. I can put 6 discs of him in my car and drive for months without taking them out! Love it!  S.
748921,bushart,2012-12-03 12:56:00,2628,  Yes it was great---We were thinking now he's 67 he may never hit the road with the horse again.
748924,bushart,2012-12-03 12:58:00,2628,"  Yeah Sink---seen him quite a few times---he sure has endured and can still write  He had the joint jumpin with that ""I was born in Ontario"""
748972,jimmer,2012-12-03 15:57:00,2730,Neil Young with Crazy Horse is by far his best shows. You're one of the lucky ones. Nice painting.
748978,bushart,2012-12-03 16:14:00,2628,  Thanks jimmer  Yeah he did that Woodstock announcement again like in Rust Never Sleeps---went into The Needle and the Damage Done on acoustic---really sweet
748989,Billy Bob,2012-12-03 17:21:00,5865,"When I seen Crazy Horse I thought of this, which I visited in '06 http://www.google.com/imgres?imgurl=http://www.unitednativeamerica.com/tribal/crazyhorse.jpg&imgrefurl=http://www.unitednativeamerica.com/tribal/crazyhorse.html&h=314&w=434&sz=47&tbnid=ZuOquobylojdIM:&tbnh=114&tbnw=158&zoom=1&usg=__dzDnkN3lQus2xRw6DEiqLeCo3ko=&docid=gBRC0JGvZhI0eM&sa=X&ei=hd28UMDjGujA0AHK-4HgCQ&ved=0CGcQ9QEwCg&dur=627  And this one too which I like even MORE...(Vegas) http://www.lecrazyhorseparis.com/en/"
