748531,jedimaster,2012-12-02 14:32:00,3472,"Not sure if this was mentioned but afaik, the company must put at least 5% ethanol in the total gas it sells. In other words Shell Regular has more ethanol in it than petro can regular. Why? because shell needs to put more in its regular to make up for the amountthey don't put in there premium. When I buy regular I buy petro or esso, when I buy premium I buy shell. This was confirmed to me by both a rep from shell and petro."
748553,Sinker,2012-12-02 15:41:00,8692,"What I don't understand is how the gas stations local to me, have NO ETHANOL, if its regulated that they have to have a certain percentage??  I tried to get the gas station owner to explain it to me, but he doesn't even understand.  Clearly, ethanol free gas is out there and available from somewhere. Is it just my area, or what?  S."
747929,pikehunter,2012-11-30 12:47:00,1659," I don't doubt what you and Terry say at all. The problem according to the mechanic, is the fact that many boat owners do not use their motors frequently so therefore condensation build up and absorbtion by the alcohol in the fuel. I experienced it as a fact.  I tried Shell 91 in my car this week for the first time since I have had this car as it has been running like crap recently. I actually ran it right down to near empty, something I very rarely do as I usually don't let it get below a half tank. Put 40 bucks in it which was about half a tank at $1.40/L but 3 cents off for an air miles card so I paid $1.37/L while reg. was $1.24/L. So far, knock on wood, it is running pretty good and I appear to have gone from 12.5 - 13.4 L/100km to 10.4 - 11.3 L/100km. same distance of about 54 km round trip daily on a commuter route averaging 100- 110 km/hr. So for the trial run it is looking decent. I will try it again the next fill up probably today and see what happens. It could be just that I have ran most of the crap out of the fuel system and it is like a clean start  or there could be something to it.  See what happens over the next week or so and then I'll probably go back to running the same old cheap Pioneer reg gas in the car as I'm such a tight wad!"
748120,Sinker,2012-11-30 22:32:00,8692,"^^  I get an additional 100-150km per 60L tank of fuel EVERY time with the V-power. (depending how heavy my foot is and where I'm going)  If I can't get it, and fill up with petro, or whatever (ethanol)......I notice the difference in my mileage after the first 100km.  Its worth it for me to run premium. It costs me $4-5 per tank more to fill up, but I get a lot more miles out of it.  I only learned this because my car has a high compression, turbo engine. The manufacturer recommends the premium fuel, or I'd never touch the stuff. This is also how I learned about V-power having NO ethanol. Its a fact.  Another thing, If I fill up with premium with no ethanol from my local gas station (no ethanol in any of their gas) I also get better mileage. As soon as I put corn gas in it, my mileage sucks  :asshat:ass , and the car just seems slow.  This is just in my experience. I have no scientific facts to back any of this up, but I have been keeping a very detailed record of my mileage for the last 5 years, and it all adds up.  This is why I run it in my 2 strokes too.  P.S.... I've never had a fuel related issue in my life. Never, ever. Before ethanol, I would use the same old crappy gas from the fall, in my outboard, in the spring, and have never had an issue. No stablilizer, no seafoam, nothing.  When ethanol came out, I had problems with my engine sputtering at full throttle. I changed the gas line, and it went away, so I took the line apart, and found the inside of it was mushy and deteriorated. I then checked my fuel filter, and found pieces of my fuel line in the filter. I changed the line, and haven't had an issue since. I blame it on ethanol in my gas. I won't run it in anything I own unless I have no choice, and even then, I get just enough to get me where I need to go.  S."
748150,fishindevil,2012-12-01 00:09:00,6254,It's true corn gas is just garbage !!! But like I asked a few posts ago does anyone know where or how to get a list of companies that don't have corn in their gas ??? What about ultramar gas ?? They sure have a lot of stations and I pass several on my way to my new work location does their premium hae corn as well ???? Thanks
748183,irishfield,2012-12-01 01:44:00,26272,"Shaun... mark a glass jar about an inch up with a permanent marker... and put some water in the jar up to that line. Slap a lid on it and throw it in the truck. Hit your local gas station and while filling up put a squirt (of gas silly) in the jar, then continue to fill up your truck. In the time you fill the truck leave the jar sitting on top of the pump. If the ""water"" line rises above the marked line, there is ethanol in the gas. It's as simple as that..."
748232,fishindevil,2012-12-01 10:53:00,6254,Thanks Wayne I will try that  and see what happens !!! I just got my 2 sleds out if storage and back when I put them away. Last spring I filled them up with premium added the proper amount of stabil and added a cup of seafoam to each sled !!!! So I'm hoping things are ok !!! They go to the dealer to get serviced . Last year I actually siphoned out the gas cause I didn't want it to gum up my engines like I said I have thrown out more gas between my boats and sleds its never ending paranoid battle with garbage corn gas !!!  So far no issues but that's maybe cause I just don't trust corn gas and always run fresh gas ... Thanks

748296,BillM,2012-12-01 15:59:00,17367," So you're really not gaining any mileage with the V-Power, you're just not losing any mileage compared to when you're running a ethanol blend...  Turbo motors are extremely fussy when it comes to fuel..  I'm assuming you've got a WRX?  You should see what running e85 and a retune will do to that motor!  Pretty impressive (Although the mileage will suck, lol)"
748299,Sinker,2012-12-01 16:26:00,8692," No, I have an '04 Forester XT. Same stuff, different pile I guess.  Essentially, you are right though.  Mileage sucks on them all, but fun to drive  If my mileage was any worse, I would get rid of it!! I'm getting about 450km/60L tank right now. It gets a little better on a long highway drive, but not much. Most of my daily driving is country roads doing 100km/hr for the most part. No stop/go for me.  I'm not into tuning this engine. I already blew one up  60K on this new one, so far so good, but I don't pound on it like I did the other one.  S."

748407,Vanselena,2012-12-01 22:35:00,269,  Well I could agree except on the way our we did a test and the reg tank ran at 22mph while the premium tank ran at 25mph. On the way in with the extra 120lbs of fish that is when we saw the big difference. I don't think it was because of water or plugged up because the next day on  the way out we achieved the same performance as the day before. IMO definitely under load the premium shines.
748428,fishindevil,2012-12-02 01:02:00,6254,Thanks for the replies ecmilley posted some info as well about stations too thanks sinker I always run premium in my sleds and outboards but its good to know

748483,pikehunter,2012-12-02 10:49:00,1659," OK, winter gas you pump while wearing boots, gloves, a hat and a coat. Summer you can get away with wearing shorts, a t shirt and sandles. Simple.  Well, how much wittier can one be at 5:30 in the morning"
748485,Terry,2012-12-02 11:00:00,14456," my turn  summer gas everyone gets a whiff right away winter gas, it takes time to make it out of the floatation suit and by the time it makes it to your head opening you forget it's your own gas you're smelling  but it keeps you warm"
748489,fishindevil,2012-12-02 11:45:00,6254,Well supposedly there was different formulas for winter gas and for summer gas ??? Was that pre-corn gas I can't remember ??? Even my Yamaha 50hp tiller in the manual says minimum 87 octane but running the medium or plus gas is recommended ??and it's a new motor built to the corn gas specs so if we run the non corn gas in 91 octane I guess other than storage does that mean I should not use seafoam every tank or only if its gonna sit for a few weeks? The govt just has to keep screwing things up  grrrrrrr
748511,pikehunter,2012-12-02 13:28:00,1659," OK then, guess one can be wittier than I in the early morning hours.  That reminds me not too many years ago Canadian regular gas was rated at 89 octane while in the States it was rated at 87. Back then the car I had would ping like crazy on Yanky gas but fine on Canadian gas. Now both are now rated at 87. Ethanol the reason? Or did the Canuck companies figure out they could perhaps make a higher profit margin by lowering the octane to 87? Or maybe, it was because they took lead out of gas? Questions questions questions....it is all confusing"

He also has no faith in additives that are supposed to solve the ethal issues as they just soak up the moisture and over time if you don't run your tank dry and keep topping it up the water accumulates as it's still there, all absorbed by the conditioner/additive and you'll still end up with problems. My motor was proof of that.  He said to only use Shell premium. All the others are OK for your car since you drive it daily but a boat can sit for days or weeks at a time without being ran and the condensation build up creates havoc!  I ran the top Shell gas until I sold it this spring. You don't believe it! Go ahead and keep running the cheap crap in your boat and expect to pay the shop in the end! Pay a buck or so more per tank and you may prevent a washed out fishing trip and then have to pay more later."

747384,pikehunter,2012-11-28 04:16:00,1659," Well Terry, I'll put it this way. The motor was a 2005, 25hp 2 stroke Johnson I bought brand new. I didn't use it daily or sometimes not even weekly. I ran the brand name Evinrude fuel conditioner/stabilizer (smells like crap!) in it always after I read several topics here in regards to ethanol and the trouble it causes with boat motors. I thought I was safe and doing the right thing, even the marina I bought it at told me this. After I started to have problems and couldn't get it into the shop where I purchased it at I ended up taking it to a  repair shop in Ancaster. It cost me about $400 in the end last fall to get it straightened out . I sold it this spring due to other reasons.  Maybe you have been lucky  with your outboard or manage to run it more frequently than I, but I learned my lesson the wallet hurting way. I have to say it wasn't much fun having motor trouble out in the middle of Hamilton Harbour but it could have been in a place much more remote or in bad weather."
747385,Sinker,2012-11-28 04:25:00,8692," You don't have that corn gas up there though, do you?  S."
747389,Terry,2012-11-28 09:58:00,14456, do you have the same problem with your car cars trucks atvs skidoos all use ethanol and like your outboard all are ethanol ready
747407,ecmilley,2012-11-28 12:39:00,2163,"maybe there ready for ethanol but the issue is when it sits, still seeing carbs with seized needle seats ect due to ethanol,   fuel injection doesn't seem as affected though(guessing more stainless steel components), but i am still fixing a ton of boats and sleds with ethanol related issues, or anything that tends to sit for long periods of time, problem1 is corn alcohol is a solvent and will eat away at rubber, brass and other fuel components over time seen many a leaking omc carb bowl due to it then it absorbs water gets even more acidic and causes corrosion"
747411,pikehunter,2012-11-28 13:27:00,1659,"Terry, read my first post again and see what the mec. said about a car and an outboard. Also what ecmilley said.  Hey, I'll admit I'm no expert or an experienced, trained, documented and licenced mechanic so why would you argue against a guy who runs a busy repair shop with 2 guys working for him? And my own motor and wallet was the evidence.  But then again I run into those who argue with me at least once a week in my own field. I guess there are people everywhere who'll argue that it's a rainy miserable day when the sun shines brightly and there isn't a cloud to be seen as far as the horizon reaches.  So why not pay a few cents more at the pump for your boat's gas? I hope for you and your passengers sake you don't get stuck with a failing motor out in the middle of a lake with a thunderstorm  coming at you. Well then at least if that should happen then I can say ""I told ya so!""  Happy  No harsh feelings, just my opinion learned from a personal experience and from others who have encountered the same issue."

747734,whiskywizard,2012-11-29 15:58:00,305,"  I'd like to hear more about the source of the info Jeff. I know the mandatory labels warn you how much ethanol 'might' be present. But I think you're talking about actual percentages, not possible percentages, right?  With respect to Petro Can's fuel, is it always <3% ethanol, or does it change seasonally/geographically?  How can you tell what it is before pumping it? I have never seen a more difinitive sticker than the ""May Contain Up To...""    Is this something that you learned personally, as an insider, or something that I can determine when I'm at the pump, or from the interwebz?"
747736,ecmilley,2012-11-29 16:03:00,2163,"actually from the laws as i read them that total gasoline sales must contain 5% ethanol in ontario at least, so it;s usually the 87 grade that has the most corn gas in it to meet the 5% quota while higher grades can caontain less or none"
747821,jeffw,2012-11-29 23:03:00,267,I know this first hand as I work for a petrocanada marketer and have had several discussions with varying suncor reps and tech people. All these problems that people are having with ethanol in regular gas is because of water or they are getting crappy fuel. I have been using regular gas from our cardlocks in my 1994 20hp evinrude for the past 7 years and have not had a single issue.

745031,hirk,2012-11-19 02:13:00,571,Sorry but your inreased performance and reduced usage is just your perception. You will not benefit from using higher octane fuel than what the engine was engineered for in either instance. Higher octane just burns slower and could cause more carbon build up if anything.
745037,Sinker,2012-11-19 02:30:00,8692,"That's all I run in my 2 strokes, and have been since ethanol was introduced. There are a few local gas stations in my area that have zero ethanol as well, and I run regular if I get it from those stations.  I don't notice any performance benifits from the higher octane, I just like the piece of mind that there is no ethanol. I still always run a few ounces of seafoam in every tank though. I think it helps with the carbon build up from the slower burning higher octane.  All that said, I run the shell V-power in my turbo subaru, and it increases my mileage about 100km per tank. If I'm putting premium fuel in it anyways, that's the best stuff in my experience. I've tried them all, and keep a detailed log of my mileage, and the V-power is miles ahead of everything out there. If it wasn't a high compression engine designed for higher octane fuel, I would just burn any old regular out there, but the car is engineered for  premium fuel, and it does performe much better with the V-power.  S."
745040,irishfield,2012-11-19 02:37:00,26272," Yes (if you were talking a true gas to gas comparison) and No... fuel with Ethanol in it doesn't put out as many BTU's as 100% gasoline does. Canadian Aero engines ran a bird on Alcohol for a few years around this area and it's rated 100HP engine, when put on the dyno, could only produce 91 HP on alcohol. It made 102hp on the same dyno run when using gasoline or 100LL. This same HP performance loss = a fuel consumption increase by running gasoline with 10% or more Ethanol mixed into it. Ethanol fuel simply can't put out the same amount of power without increasing fuel consumption and even then I doubt you're getting full HP."
745048,captpierre,2012-11-19 03:02:00,2521,CBC's Marketplace recently did a show on premium vs regular gas.  Found no difference in mileage or improved emissions.  But then they didn't compare premium without ethanol.
745052,irishfield,2012-11-19 03:17:00,26272,"If you could compare ""regular"" 100% gasoline to ""regular"" 10 to 15% ethanol mix gasoline, you would find that you get better fuel mileage on the straight gas! Premium doesn't even enter into the equation... until you buy Premium without ethanol and compare it to regular with the crap in it."

745099,ecmilley,2012-11-19 13:03:00,2163, agree and have proven it time and again in my boat truck sled that 100% gasoline regardless of the octane will always get better fuel mileage and power
745104,barrystrs,2012-11-19 13:38:00,75,Ultramar Premium also advertises no ethanol.
745110,bushart,2012-11-19 14:23:00,2628,Since the repair bills to my fuel system 2 years back---all's I run in my o/b is shell premium
745114,whiskywizard,2012-11-19 14:54:00,305,"Yup- Marketplace got it right; engines that don't require the higher octane don't benefit from being fed higher octane.  I noticed Marketplace did not test a high-compression engine to see how it would do on low-octane Regular. I did hear them state pretty clearly that engines designed to run on Premium (higher octane) performed better and got better fuel range when they ran the proper fuel.  So somebody gave them the right info.  I sure wish I could find a steady supply of both regular and premium without ethanol. I need the premium for 1 car (turbo, hi comp) and 2 sleds (2-stroke). I'd like the non-ethanol Regular for everything else, like the boat, mowers, trimmers etc.  I'm finding that most big marinas still offer ethanol-free regular gas but I don't like their fuel prices very much."
745116,Raf,2012-11-19 15:02:00,3495,Modern high compression engines (whether high compression due natural aspiration or forced induction [turbo/supercharger]) come equipped with a knock sensor that will idiot ignition timing when they detect knock (pre-ignition) for whatever reason (such as running low octane fuel).  This is a safeguard to prevent detonation in the engine.  The result?  Poorer performance (and thus fuel economy) if you run regular in an engine designed to run on premium.  Running higher octance fuel in a non-modified engine than what is recommended is absolutely useless -- unless the engine is old and carbed up pretty badly.
745123,ecmilley,2012-11-19 16:18:00,2163,birch point is the only marina i've found on sturgeon with premium fuel in the winter time should only be a 10 minute run up the lake for ya
745126,whiskywizard,2012-11-19 16:43:00,305,  That's good info to have. Thanks Ernie.
745163,DRIFTER_016,2012-11-19 18:56:00,10439,"One of the joys of living in the Arctic is not having to worry about ethanol issues. They do not use ethanol in any of the fuels used in Nunavut, The NWT, Yukon or Alaska due to the moisture issues associated with corn juice. I run regular 87 octane Shell unleaded fuel in everything I own that has a gas motor. No problems what so ever."
745175,Sinker,2012-11-19 20:45:00,8692,"The gas station in Millbrook in ethanol free, as well as the XTR in pontypool. Lucky for me, I live half way between both of them, and that's where I get my regular, ethanol free gas.  Any other time, its V-power.  I also watched the market place episode on high test gas. It was a little biased if you ask me.  All I know is I have NEVER had a fuel issue with any engine I own, and I get way better mileage running Vpower in my turbo engine. I don't care what market place, or anyone else for that matter has to say about it.  S."
745215,BillM,2012-11-19 23:20:00,17367,All pumps need to be labeled if they contain ethanol or not.  So keep your eyes open
745251,whiskywizard,2012-11-20 01:02:00,305, I'm down and up 35 every day so Pontypool is handy for me - thanks for that tip Sinker.   
745280,Sinker,2012-11-20 03:13:00,8692,No prob. I think the one in Bethany is also ethanol free.  S.
745289,BUSTER,2012-11-20 03:39:00,1336,Good read.
746179,Vanselena,2012-11-24 02:40:00,269,Have to strongly disagree with this statement. My boat goes 3mph faster using high octane under normal load. Last year was fishing erie with a friend and we limited on bows and eyes and we had reg gas in one tank and high octane in the other tank. The regular gas we could only get the boat to go 12mph while we went twice the speed when we switched to the high octane.
746186,Sinker,2012-11-24 03:19:00,8692," I'd say the tank, or line from the regular tank is plugged or something. You may have even had water in the regular with ethanol, and none in the premium tank. There's no way your getting that much improvement just by using premium fuel.  S."
746196,DRIFTER_016,2012-11-24 04:36:00,10439," Yeah, if that were the case my boat would do 75 MPH on premium!!!!"
746220,fish_fishburn,2012-11-24 13:47:00,1311,On ocassion I have had to use regular gas because the marina was out of hi-test. I lose about 4 or 5 mph at top end. I'm running a 175 EFI that requires hi-test fuel.
