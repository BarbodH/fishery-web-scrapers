Just a reminder, it'll be too cold to pick em soon! I like to stock up for the winter for steelheading , maybe ice fishing too."
749185,funfishing,2012-12-04 14:41:00,147,"Agreed! Very gentle rain last rain, yet I don't recall ever having such an easy time with them. They are slower now and much less light sensitive. Perhaps due to the cold, or maybe they're less worried about predators at this time of year.  I was doing a late night wader fix to take advantage of the darkness to find the holes, and took a peak with my flashlight on the yard. Got a dozen in just a few minutes without hurting my back."
749217,Spiel,2012-12-04 17:11:00,9065,I think I'll stock up tonight.
749223,Walleye'm Fishing,2012-12-04 17:28:00,310,"Thanks for the heads up, I'll check out my lawn with a headlamp tonight. Worms work great for trout through the ice. Last year, my buddies and I slayed some specks with worms on our first ice brookie session."
749227,Christopheraaron,2012-12-04 17:42:00,3525,"I'll take a check too, but I'm downtown tonight so I guess I'll have to settle for those polluted worms they have down there"
749384,Walleye'm Fishing,2012-12-05 04:51:00,310,"Picked worms on my front lawn tonight and got 3 dozen giants.  Ice, ice, brookies, here I come!!!"
