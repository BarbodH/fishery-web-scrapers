748484,pikehunter,2012-12-02 10:51:00,1659,Please tell us more.
748628,big guy,2012-12-02 18:04:00,414," It literally takes me 50 pulls to get it going and doesn't have the power it's supposed to have, bogs down a lot. It's a Fiskars, which normally make great products. I noticed CTC did not carry them this year, perhaps sales were low, perhaps people caught on.  I also wonder how the propane outboard would perform in colder weather"
747519,bare foot wader,2012-11-28 18:20:00,1354,"looking into one of these for next year, anybody have any experience? good or bad  thinking about using one on a jon boat for small backlakes, canoe on portages, etc...trying to find out run time off propane vs gas, I'm thinking a 5lb propane tank would be lighter than equivalent required amount of gas for the same run time??? just a complete guess/hoping that could be the case  would guess easier to maintain, carbs fouling, no mixing, easier starting, etc  http://www.golehr.com/docs/specs/specs_5.pdf"
747520,BillM,2012-11-28 18:24:00,17367,I don't think there's anything easier then a small 2 stroke for a back lack/portage motor.
747534,Joeytier,2012-11-28 19:26:00,3990,I'd be interested to see how many hours you could get out of a 1 lb. tank.  Seems like a great design.
747537,Lip-ripper,2012-11-28 19:36:00,228,"Very cool! I watched the video on the website. No priming, no choke, 99% less pollutants and using a cheaper fuel source... seems like a solid idea!"
747540,Terry,2012-11-28 19:54:00,14456,"I prefer a 2 stroke for back lakes I am always setting the 4 stroke down the wrong way the the oil gets into everything  but if the bottles last, it would be cool"
747543,woodenboater,2012-11-28 20:01:00,2277,"Very interesting but what will make or break it for me will be cost of the outboard and running time (approx). If a single 1lb cannister can run as far as say a gallon of gas, it'd be worth looking into further, more or less. I could see using a 10lb tank with this or even a 20lb.  I think it's telling that they're not publishing these details (that I could find), esp the run time and/or distance at a given speed. Something we can compare to a gas kicker."
747549,Roy,2012-11-28 20:10:00,13728,"Taken from their site.  Fuel consumption is similar to an equivalent gas-powered outboard.   A recent test by Boating magazine found that the 5-hp Lehr could push a 12â€™ aluminum boat 4.5 mph at 3300 rpm while delivering 24.3 mpg. At 4600 rpm, speed was 6.2 mph at 3.1 mpg.  "
747553,woodenboater,2012-11-28 20:27:00,2277,Thanks Roy. Saw that but propane is measured in lbs up here so I wonder how that translates from mpg ? I'm better with charts so a simple bar graph would be easier for me to grasp  Good to see a company looking for alternatives and I wonder if they have any plans for outboards up to 9.9 ?

747561,BillM,2012-11-28 20:57:00,17367,"You're going to burn a lot more propane then you would in a similar gas engine, no doubts about it."
747562,Roy,2012-11-28 20:57:00,13728,"4.2 pounds of propane is roughly one gallon at 60F. So at 3300 rpm you'll go 24.3 miles. If what they say is correct, the mileage goes way down at 4600 RPM."

747580,aplumma,2012-11-28 21:37:00,6896,I would check also what support there is for parts and people who can work on them if you can't. It sounds like you want to go to some pretty out of the way places and while it should be durable it would stink if you had to get parts that are order in only.  Art
747581,bare foot wader,2012-11-28 21:39:00,1354,  would it be a lot more? I thought it's only about a 10-15% difference?  but propane is cheaper and are supposed to be cheaper on maintenance...or in my case don't need to worry about carbs gumming up for an o/b that is only used about half dozen times  a year
747582,Fisherman,2012-11-28 21:43:00,7201,"If you google it there's a video, the guy says a 5HP will run 1/2 hour at WOT, the 2.5HP will go 1 hour at WOT on the 1lb cylinder.  A 1lb cylinder is roughly 1/2 a quart/litre of gas, so 8 x 1lb tanks would make about a gallon.  Unless my math is really bad today, that would mean the 5HP would go about 4 hours on a gallon, hmmm. I quit."
747604,Tootsie II,2012-11-28 22:59:00,162,"You members won't like my reply, but they should ban them in Ontario until we get a hefty return deposit on those 1 lb propane bottles. I am so sick of seeing those things discarded all over the bush in Northern Ontario."
747612,Terry,2012-11-28 23:13:00,14456, no problem from me I refill them so I would never leave one behind but that is a whole different argument
747613,misfish,2012-11-28 23:15:00,29133,      THEN DONT GET THEM STARTED.  
747615,BillM,2012-11-28 23:17:00,17367,It's silly you can't refill them.  Such a waste.
