748516,fish_fishburn,2012-12-02 13:36:00,1311,I have a BIG CHIEF and it works great. The heat stays low and in colder weather I put a cardboard box over it and a plastic bag over the box as well. The best part is you dont have to open it up to add chips. Mine is a top loader I prefer over the front load units.
748521,Reelaction,2012-12-02 13:51:00,33,"Can't say enough good things about my Bradley smoker.  Ease of use, put the pucks in and let it do it's thing. I know there not the cheapest but I have mine for 15 years, use it about 10 times a year and still no signs of wearing out.  Over 15 years works out to about $15 bucks a year plus the cost of your wood pucks. Not bad for what you get      http://www.bradleysmoker.com/products/non-digital-electric-smokers/   There website is full of recipees and helpful tips on smoking"

748701,Ice Fishing Ham,2012-12-02 21:32:00,83, Hello SB I'm not cold smoking how ever it's something I'd like to try. When I mention cooler temperatures I was comparing the electric smoker to the propane one I have. The lowest I can do with the propane unit is around 200F.
749116,F7Firecat,2012-12-04 01:51:00,347,cold smoking is something id like to try for sure also!  BTW I love my Traegar (.)(.)

748214,Fang,2012-12-01 03:36:00,1330,Bass pro shops has a propane smoker on sale for $119 in the current flyer. Looks like a good starter unit.
748220,GBW,2012-12-01 04:37:00,8460,"I found the problem with a hotplate is they cycle and it didn't keep the heat steady  I have one from BPS and it works ok.  like you said, a good starter unit to figure out if you like food 'smoked'"
748225,Twocoda,2012-12-01 05:30:00,4130,awesome applies to this smoker and even more so because it was built as a family project... 
748227,fishinguypat,2012-12-01 06:52:00,547,suggestion? make your own
748247,bushart,2012-12-01 12:21:00,2628,"I had a ""True North"" tinny smoker----like the l'il Chief  Had it for some years and smoked lotsa trout in it  Reasonable price---keep box to put over smoker in cold weather"

But here's one tip if your smoking fish....VERY HARD TO  LIGHT...LOL..  But really.......make your brine with 1 gallon of water, 1/4 cup of KOSHER Salt and one cup of brown sugar....that's ALL...then soak your fish over night in it (in the fridge) before smoking...ENJOY.  Bob"
748263,Ice Fishing Ham,2012-12-01 13:13:00,83,"This is a smoker I made. I use it for making jerky and smoking fish. It was made with salvaged parts, the box is wood create, the heat source is three 500 watt bar heaters, The temperature control was at first 3 switches to control each of the heaters, then I used a dimmer switch on one of the heaters, now I have two thermostats controlling 2 of the heaters. I can keep the heat just where I want it.  As mentioned the Little Chef is a great smoker a friend had one and made some great smoked fish with it. Bradley also makes a nice unit (more $), it uses wood chip pucks. Whats good about these 2 smokers is you can keep the heat low.  This is a You tube link to a fellow who uses a Little Chief, it looks like its been through a war! When I did my first salmon smoke I followed his instructions and used his rub, it turned out great.    What ever you get make sure you can keep the temperature low, some of the propane units have too much house power!  This the smoker I made. It isn't pretty but it works great.    Making Beef Jerky      Smoke Salmon, First Try          Propane Smoker I have its great for ribs, pulled pork etc but you can't turn the heat down enough for  jerky or for smoking fish.  Macon Bacon     Pork Butt & Picnic for Pulled pork.   Hope this helps bcd, post some picture of your first smoke!      ."
748265,Rich,2012-12-01 13:47:00,3927,Has anyone used the Rival electric smokers from walmart? They look like a big crock pot. Supposedly just take a handful of chips and far less time. Would like to know how well they work.
748287,aplumma,2012-12-01 15:11:00,6896,I would think about getting a smoker that is mid level or better. The cheap units will aggravate you to the point of not enjoying the process of making some of the finest eats you can have. I have used 3 smokers and the electric is the way to go. The ability to control the temperature is important and a unit that you can regulate the smoke by removing the chips is very helpful. The other nice feature is the ability to load more wood chips without opening the main door. Here is a link to a good manufacture of smokers.  MASTER BUILT SMOKERS   Enjoy  Art
748291,GBW,2012-12-01 15:41:00,8460,"@ IFH, I would like to see some more pic's of how you have your heat source set up please."
748292,GBW,2012-12-01 15:45:00,8460,Here is the old smoker I made  http://s345.beta.photobucket.com/user/G_B_W/library/#/user/G_B_W/library/the%20smoker%20I%20made?&_suid=135437648416507868938341485165

748377,Ice Fishing Ham,2012-12-01 20:27:00,83," I like your smoker GBW. Have you used it much? How do you control the heat?  I have attached some photos of the heat source as requested. As mentioned there are are three 500 watt bar heaters, they are mounted in a metal box. The wood around the box is lined with sheet metal.  Above the box is a cookie sheet to catch drippings it also deflects the smoke and heat around the perimeter. Wood chips are placed in a small steel fry pan which is placed on the middle heater which is always on  when smoke is needed.          "
748386,GBW,2012-12-01 21:13:00,8460,"Hey now BB; you should look again as I'm SURE you are familiar with what an outhouse looks like....  Thanks, all it cost me was a bag of screws, the electric hotplate and a roll of tinfoil ($ store for that) and time as the wood was all scraps.  I did use it and had a fare bit of success with it BUT because the hotplate was not a 'good one' the process to get a good smoke and constant temp too a LONG time for the food to be ready.  and I mean LONG time some times.  If I were to do it again I would not make it so tall and I would spend a LOT more on a good hotplate.  If you click on the pic's one by one in the link you can see the full size image.  Thanks for posting your pic's too.  where did you get the materials for that heat source?"
748505,Ice Fishing Ham,2012-12-02 13:12:00,83," A electrician friend gave them to me. They were used to heat electrical cabinets. Since they were not guarded they were considered unsafe and were replaced with shielded ones. I could only guess were you could get them, maybe an electrical supply house. No idea on the cost. They are made by Chormalox here's the link.  http://www.chromalox.com/productcatalog/Component+Technologies/Strip+and+Ring+Heaters/product-family-router.aspx?f=64"
