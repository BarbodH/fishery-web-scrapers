748891,dhickey,2012-12-03 04:43:00,1038,So I picked up a 12'6 rod because I would like to try my hand at river fishing again. I did have a fly rod about 25 yrs ago but gave it up because all my friends were more intrested in bass /pike and wallyes. Reading all the threads on steelheads and pin reels has got me itching to get back to the rivers.  Long and short is that I dont know anything about fishing rivers or chromeys other than I need roe/flies/streamers but preasentation is a mystry to me?  And what do I put on a shimano convergance?  Reel/line/leeds?  Any help or advice would be very welcome..  Don.

If you want a spinning reel I would go with a Shimano Stradic . I would recommend 8 lb. test on either set up and 6 lb. flurocarbon leader . Brands for mono are numerous, but any good quality mono should do. I like drennan ,maxima, or suffix for fluro leaders."
