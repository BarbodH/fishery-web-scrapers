But, during a bit of research I did, I found the reviews to be very sporadic, One guy thought it was awesome, the other a pile of junk?  Anyways, part of me thinks that supporting North American manufactured goods is great,(ie;St. Croix, and Loomis), while the other wants to stick with something more familiar like the higher end reels such as shimano and what have you that are of course made in china, malaysia etc. etc.  Any fellow angler have any personal experience to share regarding this product?"
