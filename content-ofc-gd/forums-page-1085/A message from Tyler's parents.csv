In the past three years, the money raised at the Fishing for Tyler Get Together has helped us provide Tyler with therapists who come into our home and provide ABA/IBI therapy. It has also allowed us to pay for speech and occupational therapy for Tyler.  ABA/IBI therapy is a one on one teaching method for children with Autism that breaks down a skill into very small steps and is taught repetitively with simple directions with praise and reward.  Since September of 2007, Tyler received 20 hours per week of government funding that has allowed us to place Tyler in the Achimota Centre for Children with Autism located in Barrie. (Tyler did not receive full funding which would have been a 40 hour week.) Tyler attends Achimota 4 days a week for 5 hours per day. There they teach Tyler in a way he understands, using ABA/IBI therapy techniques. We have been so thrilled by his progress at Achimota, and we would love for Tyler to be able to attend this awesome school for a more balanced school day/week.  In the coming months, it would be very valuable for Tyler if we were able to hire a qualified ABA/IBI therapist who could take Tyler out into the community and teach him hands on life skills such as shopping/using money, swimming, attending appropriately to places like the library. He will not only learn skills but have fun in the process, meet people in his community and give us a much needed break.  Once again we thank you so much for your continued participation and help with raising funds for our son Tyler. Tyler has benefited in many way through your efforts.  Yours sincerely,  Elisa and Terry French"
159760,Big Cliff,2008-02-12 09:40:00,6899,"It's wonderful to hear that Tyler is making progress and that what little we can contribute is helping. Every year I look forward to Tyler visiting us at the event, he is such a wonderful little boy and it's obvious that all the love and support he receives from his family has helped him along the way.  It is such a pleasure to do what we can to help you and Tyler and know that it is making a difference.  Thank you for taking the time to let us know and I hope I'll get a chance to see you both again in two weeks."
159766,ccmtcanada,2008-02-12 12:13:00,7971,This will be my second year of participating the Fishing for Tyler Event.  It was a real pleasure meeting the family last year and you can count on Bly and I doing our bit for years to come.  It's great to hear the progress he is making!  See you all in 1 and a half weeks!
159784,Reef Runner,2008-02-12 13:52:00,981,"Simply magnificent Motv8r, truly inspirational.  As I mentioned in a previous post of mine, it looks doubtful that I can make it to the g2g.  However, I would be honoured to have a chance to contribute.  Is there another way I can send a small token of admiration for this great undertaking?  reefrunner"
159786,Beans,2008-02-12 13:56:00,3339,Ya...what them two Cliffs said...it is a pleasure to help!

159823,motv8tr,2008-02-12 15:13:00,2587," Hey Reefrunner, I'm sorry you won't be able to make the event.  As for still contributing there are a couple of things you can do if you wish.  The early bird auction is almost at an end, but we will have the main auction up and running after the G2G for a week, you're free to bid on any and all items  If that doesn't work for you you may send me a donation of your choice to Maureen Manning, 167 Timcourt Dr. Penetang Ont. L9M 1R2 with cheques made out to Tyler's parents, Elisa and Terry French.  Thanks to all for your support,  Maureen"
