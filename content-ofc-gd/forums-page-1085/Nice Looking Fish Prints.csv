159773,bushart,2008-02-12 12:54:00,2628,Very Impressive--these artists show their passion through their brushes.  Here's one I painted a few years back (Long as we're kinda on the topic)  Bushart  
159776,Terry,2008-02-12 13:06:00,14456,"bushart, very nice there are more then a few artist on this board, so you will fit right in......"
159780,bushart,2008-02-12 13:26:00,2628,Thanks Terry  I'm always cautious about posting pictures in this type of forum---I do not wish to annoy the mods thinking I'm posting for self promotion.  Thanks Again  Bushart
159783,Terry,2008-02-12 13:47:00,14456,no problem if you want to display a bunch of them this is where to do it   photos and art  but if you were trying to sell them the buy and sell section or the business section I like seeing them
159785,bushart,2008-02-12 13:53:00,2628,Thanks---if you wish to see more I'll post later today under the photos and art--just to view if you wish.  Bushart
