I have a Lowrance X67C and have found the supplied transducer holder both awkward to use and just a general pain. Then it came to me and the beautiful thing is, you can just steal the stuff from your kid, or your neighbours kid. However, since I am just like a kid, I already had the stuff kicking around..  Here are the things you'll need, a noodle a sharpened pencil or section of dowel and a knife to cut said noodle.   First, cut an 1 1/2"" piece off the noodle as shown.   Then, pierce the cut section of noodle untill the pencil pokes through into the middle.   Double over your transducer cable and slide it into the centre of the noodle. Once the loop is in, or even through, push the pencil between the doubled over cable.   You now have an easily adjustable transducer float. Trim the pencil off if you wish.   The darn thing even floats and hangs just right! "
