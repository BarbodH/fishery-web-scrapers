Rowley was in North Bay visiting family and decided to stay an extra day to go ice fishing with her brother and some friends.  The accident happened almost one-kilometre from shore, across from the sewage treatment plant.  By 5 p.m., the truck was still submerged, however Bartlettâ€™s Towing was on scene.  North Bay Police Service and Ontario Provincial Police are advising of open water in the area and urging the public to use extreme caution when traveling in that area and other waterways. Vehicles should not be driven areas where ice is questionable.       -------------  A member of the FishOntario Board was there and took pictures as well.  http://forums.fishontario.com/thread.jspa?...98&tstart=0    ----"

159129,Bernie,2008-02-10 15:55:00,3190,That particular area is where the sewage treatment plant is. Warm water exits there and the ice is never safe. People tried to flag her away but either didn't see them or ignored them. Areas with known high current flows should be avoided on any lake or waterway.
159147,Hotrod2066,2008-02-10 16:57:00,40,There was 17 inches of black ice near iron island where I was yesterday. I agree that the warm water coming out of the treatment plant played a large part.
159160,Cookslav,2008-02-10 17:54:00,1457," Ya I was thinking the same thing? They say people were trying to flag her and warn her butI have to ask.... If its known there is a local warm water current there, and people knew it was so unsafe they felt waveing and yelling to warn her was needed....why on earth did they park their trucks there as well?  Is it a very Localized out flow? or is the camera playing tricks?.....cause those 2 trucks, and Ice huts look to be pretty close to me?"
159166,Bernie,2008-02-10 18:11:00,3190,I was reading on another board a fellows post who witnessed it and took some pictures. I don't fish there for obvious reasons but many do because the fish do congregate in that area. From what I understand the warmth is fairly localized.
