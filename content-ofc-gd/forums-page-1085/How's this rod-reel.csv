159653,FISHINGNUT,2008-02-11 23:52:00,253,"Cant comment on the reel but I bought a 6'6"" medium light cherrywood this summer hate it snapped two different rods one on its third cast   and one on a small bass   and I didnt find it very sensative after the second one broke I didnt even bother tacking it back.But thats just my experience I am sure there are guys here that have had better luck than I have"
159654,bassman,2008-02-11 23:55:00,384,"Good deal, if they are in working order.  Google the items and you'll see that brand new there worth $100.00+"
159655,Zeynex,2008-02-12 00:02:00,6,"  What I'm worried about is, upon close inspection, there are quite a few scratches on the reel. But that doesn't probably reflect on how it really works on the inside."
159659,gone_fishin,2008-02-12 00:13:00,481,"Shimano is usually pretty reliable, can't comment on that exact model however. the cherrywood series seems to be a hit or miss for some reason... my dad broke one, i think a 6', maybe a 6'6"" casting model. but my brother and i haven't had a problem yet, mine is a 5'6"" Ultra Light spinning, and my brother's is the same as yours, the 7' spinning model.  but if you think about it, the rod itself, i believe, is sold for a little more than $30 in stores anyways. so it sounds like you got an alright deal there. i'm sure the scratches on the reel are superficial. if any of them are substantial and have a ""sharp"" feel to the touch, i would file them down just in case it comes into contact with the line."
159666,fishdawg,2008-02-12 00:21:00,912,I am a big fan of the Spirex - 4 seasons with mine & its going strong
159710,Bernie,2008-02-12 02:07:00,3190,I have 3 Spirex reels. Luv em'. Shook hands with a couple of the cherrywoods but found them a little too floppy for me.
159716,gone_fishin,2008-02-12 02:14:00,481,"just to add on to what i wrote earlier, on my Ultra-Light Cherrywood i have caught a couple 6Lb Smallmouth Bass, and it is still in one piece."
159788,Reef Runner,2008-02-12 14:07:00,981,"Shimano Spirex is a reliable reel as I owned one in the past and believe it's still hangin' around in the garage as a backup. Heard bad things about the cherrywood rod though.  I'm sure others with more experience on the rod would chime in here.  As inexpensive rods go, I really like some the the BPS models.  I got a 7foot med/heavy im6 for $35 or so (someone was hiding it in the $100 section...tisk, tisk) and I couldn't be happier with the performance.  reefrunner"
