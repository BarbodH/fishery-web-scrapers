159221,solopaddler,2008-02-10 22:01:00,8605,I'm currently in the midst of several different home reno's and had a bit of a plumbing issue crop up that I couldn't handle. I shot Mike an email through the board and he came by today and did an amazing job for me! I'm definitely going to get him to do a few other small jobs for me. Very professional and a nicer guy you'll never meet (plus he's cheap  ). Just wanted to thank him publicly for the fine work...  Big bonus is I've likely found another fishing buddy!  This board is great!

159283,ccmtcanada,2008-02-11 00:15:00,7971,Yep...I concur.  Mike helped my good friends out of a jam by doing some amazing work on their laminate floor installation.  Top notch quality and a great guy.  Doesn't get much better than that!

159346,SlowPoke,2008-02-11 01:39:00,2984,"He had my keys Wayne. That's how good of a guy he is, he didn't take off on me!"
