159067,Tdel,2008-02-10 11:30:00,393,Lots of snow and gusting wind here.   Total whiteout when the wind is blowing.  I know you would not want to be caught out in this stuff.  Stay safe.  Tom
159072,lew,2008-02-10 12:08:00,12767,I just heard the same thing a few minutes ago on the weather network Tom.  He was saying the whiteouts up in your area could be as bad today as the ones a couple weeks back that caused all those terrible accidents.  Sounds like a good day to avoid the 400
159073,outllaw,2008-02-10 12:15:00,1232,even southwest guys. its blwing here. good day for the fireplace and a movie.
159074,Tdel,2008-02-10 12:22:00,393,"It looked like it was going to quiet down after I posted.  The snow slowed down and the wind died out.  Didn't take long to for it to start up again.  Seems to have it's ups and downs.  Lew the amount of snow today is suppose to be around 6 inches which would be a piece cake to handle up here.  The snowfall we had over the weekend, a couple of weeks ago was about 3.5 ft here.   You definitely don't want to be on any highway when the winds are high and it is snowing.  It is a deadly combination for sure.  Tom."
159079,Big Cliff,2008-02-10 13:30:00,6899,"Just got back from a run to Tim Hortons; roads up here are a mess. Hwy 36 is a sheet of ice and drifts are starting to build in several areas. Just heard on the radio that Hwy. 115/35 is not in very good shape because of blowing snow.  Snug Harbour Rd. already has drifts about 2.5' deep almost all the way across the road and building fast, an other hour of this wind and the road will be blocked. It doesn't help that the City of Kawartha Lakes Municipal Services are on strike so we have very limited salt/sanding and snow ploughing.  If you don't have to go out, don't!  As outlaw said ""good day for the fireplace and a movie""."
159083,motv8tr,2008-02-10 13:45:00,2587,"Faster to make your own pot of coffee isn't it Cliff? and tastier???   .  It's blowing up here but I can still see my neighbors so it's not horrible   I'll be heading out later to get some groceries, and I expect I'll be heading to Elmvale to pick up my cousin from his weekend at Collingwood.  Trick is to turn on the fog lights (when it's dark) and take your time.  Maureen"
159087,Beans,2008-02-10 14:12:00,3339,It was snowing and blowing to beat the band just a while ago but only a few flurries now...  Was that the new Tim Horton's below the Super Jail on hwy 36 you were at Cliff?  You and I don't need any do-nuts my friend...got a bit of a shock when I stood on the scale yesterday...  Oh right...it's for the company...
159091,OhioFisherman,2008-02-10 14:24:00,6623,"It didn`t miss us either here in northern Ohio, can`t really tell how much snow, everything is moving sideways at a rapid rate."
159095,ccmtcanada,2008-02-10 14:30:00,7971,"Yep...we knew this was coming.  The kids each got a few movies yesterday for an inside day today.  Looking like a family day indoors, with the fireplace going!!!"
159098,Fisherman,2008-02-10 14:38:00,7201,"Snowing & Blowing...that would almost be a bit of an understatement, so bad at times that 15km/h is too fast, go another .5km and it's sunny, nutty weather."
159112,lew,2008-02-10 15:21:00,12767,"You country folks should stop worrying about winter and just do what we do here in Toronto everytime it snows, and call in the Army.  We had a big storm last week with a foot of snow and it was a real mess for awhile, but we put out the call for help seeing as we have no snowplows here in Toronto and the soldiers came & took it all away for us and now its just like summer here. The grass is green, there's buds on the trees, the flowers are popping up and I even  had 3 robins in the back yard feeding on worms an hour ago.  And you guys thought us city folks were dumb"
159183,Big Cliff,2008-02-10 18:42:00,6899,"Lew if we called in the Army, us country folks would have to go clear the road so they could get in to help us LOL. It's pretty bad out there, sun is shining but it's blowing and drifting so bad that at times you can't see two car lengths. I was out on my ATV and hit some drifts that were hard to get through even in 4WD.  Moe; the trip to Tim's was just an excuse to drive out and see how bad it was. It's gotten a lot worse since then, I just spent three hours out with a buddy on our ATV's we both ended up getting stuck and had to winch ourselves out. we found places where the drifts were easily three' deep."
159184,TroutnMuskieHunter,2008-02-10 18:53:00,1362,It's amazing how the weather can change so quickly.....here is a shot from my deck that was taken literally minutes ago (13:50PM)...We live 45km NW of Ottawa....   
159188,Sandbag,2008-02-10 18:58:00,533,"Weird for sure.  Bright sunny sky here in Niagara area.  Wind is up, but no snow at all.  Cheers Craig"
