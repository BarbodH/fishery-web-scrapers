159426,rhare,2008-02-11 13:01:00,387,"Well its been a great couple of weeks of fishing on Lake Simcoe and this Saturday wasn't any different. Met up with Gbaysteel(Dan) Wee Scot (Alex) and the wee scot's neighbor Bruce for a day of Laker fishing. Got a little spoiled with Alex's sled. Not used to not having to pull the hut out by hand!  Lake conditions where poor at best, must have been a foot or so of slush out there. found a nice dry spot to set up the huts and the day was under way. we decided to have a big fish pool just to make this interesting. The fish were bangin' we iced over 25 lakers and lost a pile more. I had a great day with the spoons, stopped counting at 12 iced lakers and was losing them left right and center.Fished 110fow. Alex ended up winning the big fish pool with his first of the day a 4lbser. Fish don't seem to be that big but there are lots of em.  heres some pics enjoy  hut prep      double#1       One happy fella!  Alex with his big fish of the day     "
