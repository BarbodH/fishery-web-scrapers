159527,glen,2008-02-11 16:35:00,2641,I have to  go to BPS anyway.  I didnt know they had them.  Thanks Lew.
159161,glen,2008-02-10 18:02:00,2641,What # test fluoro should i use to build my own muskie leaders????  .  Lets say i am going for the new world record and i  don't want to get bit off.  I was thinking 80#.  Also has anyone been bitten off using fluoro?????  Thanks for any help.
159169,Raf,2008-02-10 18:17:00,3495,I use 130#
159171,silveradosheriff,2008-02-10 18:18:00,1025,"Most folks are using 80#-130#, which seems to fit the bill.  :-)"
159174,Roy,2008-02-10 18:20:00,13728,"Yup, 130lb is the stuff you want and if you get bitten off with that, get your boat outta the water FAST!"
159175,lew,2008-02-10 18:26:00,12767,"Go with quality terminal tackle too Glen, Spro makes some great stuff."
159178,mattyk,2008-02-10 18:36:00,2110,i use 125lb and have not had any problems yet.
159181,Rizzo,2008-02-10 18:39:00,4754,I use 150 lb.  Never been bit off but have had to replace some after getting nicked.  I've tried 50 lb for pike and have been bitten off.
159186,SlowPoke,2008-02-10 18:54:00,2984,"Not a recommendation, just my experience... I'm using 80#, no break offs but have had nicks. I use 80 because I can tie knots with it. If I had crimpers/sleeves I would probably run 130+ for trolling and 80 for casting. -Brian"
159189,FishHeadRic,2008-02-10 18:59:00,226,Go heavy! At least 130. I have been bitten off once fishing pike. I was using 80lb.  FHR
159197,glen,2008-02-10 19:26:00,2641,Ok i will try 130#.  Spro solid ring ball bearing swivels 150#.  I might try the norman speed clips too.  I will test the leaders past the breaking point of the 80# power pro.  I am going to order some more muskie stuff. Thankyou for the help.
159200,irishfield,2008-02-10 19:36:00,26272,Going after more of these GBay giants Glen?  
159205,lew,2008-02-10 19:53:00,12767,"Glen, have a look at the  Stringease stay-lok snaps.  Their one of the best around and will never come undone accidentely  "
159207,irishfield,2008-02-10 19:55:00,26272,Somehow he has some of those Lew !
159208,glen,2008-02-10 20:14:00,2641,"Yes i am getting ready.  I will make a few with the stay lock snaps but i am going to try the speed clips too.  If i hook a monster my gear will not fail.  I don't know if i will top that one Wayne.  What was it 6'6"" or 7'."
159209,irishfield,2008-02-10 20:28:00,26272,"6' 6"" Glen... so you can improve on that as I'm sure there's some 7's or 8's out there !"
159213,ChrisK,2008-02-10 20:54:00,2772,"I, like Slowpoke use the 80lb because of the convinience of being able to tie a knot with it. Ive always used lighter aplications because it gives me more of a feeling of finnessing the fish thus giving me the an advantage. And of course like everyone else says here,use quality terminal tackle because most of the time thats where your weakness's will be on your leader.  Good luck !!"
159216,ecxstriper,2008-02-10 21:30:00,343,I'm not a Musky guy but I use 80 to 100 # flouro for my leaders . I have only ever been biten off once but that was a medium size shark ( 5'>6') .
159327,Ramble,2008-02-11 01:18:00,713,I've been thinking about these leaders for a while....do tehy require any special knots for the heavy line...and have any of you actually noticed a differance in the amount of fish you catch?  -Ramble
159376,Raf,2008-02-11 03:13:00,3495,"Ramble, what I personally like is how durable the are.  You do have to check for knicks and replace as neccessary but the fluoro leaders last a long time.  They don't kink like wire does for one thing.   They also tend to be a little friendlier on the fish should they roll in them.  However, if you've a good supply of wire leaders I would not rush out and switch to fluoro.   I don't beleive a pike/muskie care whether or not your lure has wire or fluoro leader attached to it.  I don't tie 130, I use crimps."
159392,scuro,2008-02-11 05:39:00,386,  An unseen pike did that at Kesagami...about 2/3rds the way through 80 pound test. I bought 120 pound test after that trip.
159480,Tybo,2008-02-11 15:14:00,1373,"Glen; If you are talking about the swivel that have a loop in them. where you slide the lure on. Stay away. I've had lures come off of them in the weeds and had to cut one, when it collapsed on a snag between rocks."
159503,glen,2008-02-11 15:53:00,2641,Tybo  It is not a swivel it is just a clip made of stainless steel.  Is that the one that you have had trouble with?  http://www.cabelas.com/cabelas/en/template...&hasJS=true Cabela's -- Norman Lures Speed Clip   I dont want to try them if the open up.  Thankyou.
159507,lew,2008-02-11 16:02:00,12767,"Glen, stick with the Stringease, their are a proven product and won't let you down."
159523,glen,2008-02-11 16:24:00,2641,They are hard to buy Lew.  I do most of my shopping online.  From Cabelas or lebarons and they dont carry stringease.  I was going to order some stuff from stripper tackle and thorns bros but i aint too sure about the duty.  I think they make up a $$$ amount when the package hits the border.  At this point it is harder to catch muskie gear then it is to catch muskie.  How many days do i have left cause i might need them all.
159525,lew,2008-02-11 16:30:00,12767,"Don't know where your located Glen, but if your in the GTA you can definetely get the Stringease snaps at JB's, BPS or Tightlines in Pickering.  Be sure to get the big ones, I use #5 myself but you can go larger if you want."
