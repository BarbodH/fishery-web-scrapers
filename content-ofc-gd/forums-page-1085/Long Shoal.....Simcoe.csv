Usually head out from Innisfil Beach but have not ventured out yet this season. Not looking for anyone's honey holes....Just want to make sure it's safe to venture out (by sled), then we can find our own spots.  Any info would be muchly appreciated.  Meely"

159229,RyanJohnson,2008-02-10 22:51:00,11,"The Ice Conditions between Innisfil Beach and Long Shoal are not good for us Long Shoal people, the farthest I have made it is the 9th line, if you look out from the 9th you will see a group of huts, im out there. Thats as far as I know of anyone going. I was on 5 inches 2 weeks ago and with this cold weather should harden things up.  The fishing was good late Jan off Innisfil beach and since the perch seemed to move in to 80 fow, thats when I decided to head closer to long shoal off the 9th to 87 fow, the fishing has been good when we could get out there freggin warm front, then when it got cold again mother nature dumped 18 inches of snow on top to insulate it. So the conditions havent gotten much better. Keep your fingers crossed for lots of cold weather."
