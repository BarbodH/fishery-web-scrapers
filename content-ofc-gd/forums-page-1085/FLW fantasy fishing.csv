159089,cthewrld,2008-02-10 14:24:00,99,"Something that is free in which you could win lots of money is not considered spam.  Spam is an unsolicited message in which you are asked to spend money.  This is no different than fantasy nascar, fantasy football, fantasy hockey etc.  I just thought that people that fish might be interested in winning something in which all they have to do is guess how some fisherman will do in a tournament.  Take it for what it is .... not what it isn't."
