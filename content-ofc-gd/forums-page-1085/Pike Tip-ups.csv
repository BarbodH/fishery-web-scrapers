158763,richyb,2008-02-09 01:44:00,774,at the beginning of the season i got some big shinners. when i was done fishing that day i froze the ones i had left .. my pike tip up is a windlass?  it has a metal part that catches the wind and the wind actually jigs it a bit . I have been using the dead shinners every time i go out and catching pike on it .
158770,Terry,2008-02-09 02:06:00,14456,this time of year I think live bait is better as we get closer to the end of the ice I find dead bait works best
158863,Rizzo,2008-02-09 16:24:00,4754,"I hope Terry is on to something.  I asked the same question a couple of months back and dead bait on bottom seemed to be a lot of people's preference.  Last time we went out I put half the lines with dead bait on bottom and half with live bait (big shiners, suckers).  We didn't get a single hit on the dead bait, but caught several pike on the live bait.  Obviously this was early in the season.  I was definitely disappointed in the dead bait results, but many people swear by it.  Based on Terry's info I'll try it again in a month"

159090,Mike the Pike,2008-02-10 14:24:00,3421,I mostly jig with my ice rods but do you tip ups also.  Recently I purchased some large size sweedish pimples in chartreuse colour floresent green tipped with a medium size shiner.  I found them to be a HIT with the pike.Now that I have an under water camera I was impressed to see there jigging action.  I am sure they will work well with tip ups.I like the fact that the extra weight keeps your line straight and taught.  I have never caught a pike with dead bait.  Good luck sweedish pimples Rock
