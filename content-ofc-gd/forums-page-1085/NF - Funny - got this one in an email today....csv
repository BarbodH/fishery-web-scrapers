We all looked at each other and another customer asked, ""What is a seven-hundred-ten?""  She replied, ""You know, the little piece in the middle of the engine, I have lost it and need a new one..""  She replied that she did not know exactly what it was, but this piece had always been there. The mechanic gave her a piece of paper and a pen and asked her to draw what the piece looked like. She drew a circle and in the middle of it wrote 710.  He then took her over to another car which had its hood up and asked ""is there a 710 on this car?""  She pointed and said, ""Of course, its right there.""   If you're not sure what a 710 is:                                          Burt"
