159163,Sandbag,2008-02-10 18:08:00,533,"Well  Just loaded up the snowmobiles and truck and ready to head to Nip for a few dats with a group of 10 from work.  I even took a photo to post of the rig all ready to leave, however after trying to post it a few times unsucessfully my blood pressure spiked.  I gently placed the computer monitor back down on the desk and grabbed a cold drink.  My wife said the blood vessel on the right temple is almost back to normal now.  I hope the driving conditions are a bit better tomorrow as I hear they are pretty crappy in some places right now.  I will take photos on the trip and God willing I will figure out how to post them upon my return.  As you can likely tell I'm no computer wizzard, but I never figured it would be that frustrating. hahahahah  Take care all and I hope to have a good report for ya in a few days.  PS...I've seen the posts about the truck going through on Nip.  I won't be going venturing anywhere that our operator tells us isn't safe.  Ok...Going to try the tip Bernie gave on another post for photo posting    Thanks Bernie     all ready to roll with the report now when I get back   Cheers  Craig"
