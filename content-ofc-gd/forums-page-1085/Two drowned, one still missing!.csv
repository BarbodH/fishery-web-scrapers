Like many on this board, I've travelled a gazillion miles by snowmobile at night over quite a few years and even though we were always careful.....well usually anyways......we ALWAYS avoided crossing lakes in the dark even when we were familiar with them.  Condolances to the families and hopefully the news will be better for the 3rd rider."
