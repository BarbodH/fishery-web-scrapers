159517,Jen,2008-02-11 16:11:00,833,"I have seen a lot of walleye coming out of the River lately and it never ceases to amaze me how different each and every one looks.  The SEASONED fisherman knows all the reasons for this,  however being ""new to catching fish"" (Not new to fishing... ) I am forever intrigued.  Well Done Jeff... you certainly know how to find those fish!  Cheers,  Jen"
