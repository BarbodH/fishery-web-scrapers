Id really like to get into some brookie fishing in Ontario, and it would be awesome if we could drive there.  Brookies and lakers would be my main target, and I wouldn't mind some pike/walleye also, but I know this is hard to get in one area. I was thinking of a few places ive found where you drive to sudbury and float plane over to a private lake with lakers/pike and brookies in the rivers.  They are also quite affordable, i just dont know if the fishing is all its chalked up to be (spelling?)  Does anyone know of any good parks to camp at.....or lodges/cabins with good fishing?  Anyway all opinions/thoughts are greatly appreciated! Please PM me  Thanks,  Mike  PS - if you need any more detail just ask, i feel like ive left something out!"
