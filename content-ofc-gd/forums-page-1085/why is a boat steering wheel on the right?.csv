159303,FISHINGNUT,2008-02-11 00:50:00,253,Just wondering why the steering wheel on a boat is on the right hand side and not the left like a car ?
159305,Terry,2008-02-11 00:53:00,14456,it is because of the rotation of the prop... having  a lone person on that side of the boat helps to level it out
159309,Sinker,2008-02-11 00:56:00,8692,"My dad has a 24ft Fairline, and the wheel is on the left.  Don't see it like that too often though.......it takes a while to get used to it.  Going thru locks and stuff its better to have the wheel on the right.....then you can see the docks clearly. On the left your looking over the baot all the time...... a bit of a PITA.  Sinker"

159328,Mike the Pike,2008-02-11 01:19:00,3421,   Funny Wayne I wanted to say the same thing but you beat me to it.
159329,SlowPoke,2008-02-11 01:19:00,2984," Left, right, center.... I don't care. AS LONG AS IT'S NOT A TILLER!"
159332,Mike the Pike,2008-02-11 01:20:00,3421,  Whats a matter a guy who can shift through 20 plus gears on a rig is afraid of a Tiller
159338,Fisherman,2008-02-11 01:28:00,7201,"No, no,  it's holding onto something long and round and vibrates a bit that's bigger than his own."
159341,SlowPoke,2008-02-11 01:30:00,2984,The only thing that frightens me about a tiller is getting it mixed up with the rental boats at a lodge.
159342,Mike the Pike,2008-02-11 01:32:00,3421, 
159343,Mike the Pike,2008-02-11 01:34:00,3421,  you guys are quick.
159347,SlowPoke,2008-02-11 01:43:00,2984, I'm somewhat uncomfortable knowing that you have spent time pondering my appendage.

159389,Greencoachdog,2008-02-11 04:51:00,8163,What's a Tiller???
159434,lazybum,2008-02-11 13:58:00,142, Isn't that what you use for gardening?
159471,Tybo,2008-02-11 15:02:00,1373,"It started back,way back. When they first put steering wheels into boats, the return springs where so heavy on the throttle. That it was easer to hold it in the right hand(most people being right handed).  Terry a car engine rotates the opposite way.  Most boats you see with it on the left. IS because they use a foot throttle. You need space to bolt it down or you will screw it through the hull."
159479,lew,2008-02-11 15:13:00,12767,"Take a look at the picture I posted in the thread ""who's your mentor"" and you'll see my dad sitting in his boat about 1955. Not only is the steering wheel on the left side of the boat, but it's also located in the rear seat, which was fairly common  on cedarstrips back in the day.  You'll also see the throttle & gear shift were 2 seperate levers compared to todays engines that combine them both in the same lever."
