658380,bobowski,2012-01-20 04:17:00,360,I went out from Gilford today. It was a solid 5-6 inches.
658521,cityfisher,2012-01-20 19:53:00,959,any sleds/ quads out there? im thinking of giving it a shot over the weekend
658522,ch312,2012-01-20 20:07:00,1590," out of gilford yesterday about 3/4 of the ice had zero snow and was very slick. chains, airing down to 1 psi, or studs would be a good idea for the quads.  6"" of solid black ice out there means it's a-ok for the machines."
658546,cityfisher,2012-01-20 21:17:00,959, Right on thanks... hopefull we get some snow overnight... should be busy out there on the weekend
658547,misfish,2012-01-20 21:26:00,29133,"  YA,HOW MANY   WILL PARK ON THE ICE?"

658743,Fisherman,2012-01-21 13:15:00,7201,"Hahahahaha, apparantely the first doofus went through all by himself, how unfortunate, not inviting any friends."
