This sounds decent.  $69 for 4hours(kinda short..) ice fishing hut rental for up to 12 people, here is what RideOnRentals.com says is included in the offer      Doesn't sound like too bad of a deal, especially if you want to go with first timers or kids to keep them warm.  My question is, what lake is it on? I am definitely interested to go with a group of people. At $70, bring 7-10 people and its pocket change per person.   What do you all think?"
