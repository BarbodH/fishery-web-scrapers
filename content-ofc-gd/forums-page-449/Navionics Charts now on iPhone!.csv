658481,Harrison,2012-01-20 16:25:00,2202," Yep, good to go Ben, but what do you need them for? I've seen pictures. lol.."
658485,Grimace,2012-01-20 17:04:00,2020,"No problem Ben.  As Harrison pointed out, you don't need the bloody thing anyways.  Edit: Typo"
533967,scugpg,2011-01-02 21:28:00,1373, That's what got me as well. Wondering if there is a difference in quality of maps between them.
533968,Gregoire,2011-01-02 21:38:00,1397,"It does cover the Trent Severn, also lots of Kawartha Lakes. Right now I'm wishing I'd only gotten the great lakes app."
537054,fishboy,2011-01-09 17:29:00,550,"So, do you need to purchase the Great Lakes separately from the Ontario Lakes?"
537058,ColdH20guy,2011-01-09 17:37:00,312,"I recently downloaded the android app ""great Lakes' and love it! It covers a ton of lakes from east to west including Ottawa River, Georgian Bay, Lake Simcoe, tons more and quite a few in northern NY State.It doesnt quite go up to Lake Muskoka but still awesome... It shows the depths of the lakes, shoals, distances and a lot more..perfect for us boaters without a gps/sonar unit right now..cheaper too! It will use a lot of your battery and data plan..just fyi  (data plan outside your home, inside you should be able to use your wireless router)..but the battery will go down if you are on it all day!  enjoy"

537138,kukbonz,2011-01-09 20:41:00,2,"What is the app called? I went to the apple iPhone store and searched ""great lakes"" and nothing showed up for Canada. Which is the best app available for the iPhone thru the app store?"
537152,ColdH20guy,2011-01-09 20:59:00,312,its called Navionics..I dont have the iphone but assume its the same as for my samsung
537240,fishboy,2011-01-10 00:58:00,550," if you search Navionics, it will come up"
537283,Stoty,2011-01-10 02:29:00,2910,"Dirks... yes it does have Rice/Scugog, etc on it. It is a MUST have if you dont have a GPS/Sonar combo in your boat!!"
537334,Canuck,2011-01-10 03:49:00,491,"You should see what it looks like on an iPAD.  Wow.  Big, bright screen. Finger touch.  Fast redraw.   Works better than my $2500 Raymarine chartplotter.  The app is 19.99 for the iPAD.  The same chart alone for my Raymarine was $299 when I bought it."
537445,cityfisher,2011-01-10 15:37:00,959,we downloaded it over the weekend on QUinte... for some reason it only shows Meters for all of quinte eventhough the setting is set to FEET..... It does work well other than that Glitch
537462,batoathome,2011-01-10 16:49:00,47,Here is one for Blackberry users have not tried it but looks ok.  http://www.toposports.com/main/allvideos
537474,Jon,2011-01-10 17:32:00,209,"I have the Canadian Lakes version for my Ipod Touch.  In terms of Ontario lakes, it has Simcoe, the bigger Kawartha Lakes, Rideau Canal, numerous Haliburton area lakes, limited Great Lakes data (eg. Eastern Lake Ontario and Parry Sound) and then a smattering of others.  Can't go wrong for $10, even though the GPS function doesn't work.  Still nice for planning trips and it does get you in the ballpark.  I figure they can only add more data in the future and if I ever buy an Iphone, I'm set.  Jon"
537558,doubleheader,2011-01-10 20:52:00,497,"I think I paid $9.99 when I downloaded it off the Navionics website. Once you have the app you have every lake Navionics has charted in the US and Canada. Trying mine on the ice for the 1st time Friday. It's pretty cool, hope it's accurate."
537663,rufus,2011-01-10 23:49:00,267,I have the Navionics app for my iphone and also for my HTC Android phone. You don't need an iphone - you can go with an Android phone instead and the app costs the same and works the same.
537783,Stoty,2011-01-11 02:44:00,2910," Yes it is a glich..just don't forget to multiply by 3, lol. Navionics is currently working on a fix to this, which should be out in the next few weeks."
549800,MSBruno,2011-02-10 14:19:00,369,"Looking at a map for my Ipad.  Can anyone tell me what kind of detail is on Sparrow Lake?  It's not listed as one of the lakes, but I've seen somme maps from Navionics which show Sparrow Lake detail.  Sparrow Lake is the next lake north of Couch."
549820,EC1,2011-02-10 14:45:00,930,"I have the Great Lakes version of Navionics, and it includes sparrow lake and in terms of detail, it is about the same as any of the other lakes on this map. I don't guarantee that the Canada version will have it. My maps cover to just before Six Mile and there's pretty much none of the Muskoka lake maps in there"
549891,MSBruno,2011-02-10 16:42:00,369, is this the $35 ipad app on navionics?
656746,GYPSY400,2012-01-15 08:32:00,191,Does anyone know if this app covers Northern Ontario.. (Sudbury )?? Judging by the map picture in the app store it's got a big hole wher I would go fishing.
656761,Handlebarz,2012-01-15 12:15:00,3790,Sounds like a must have for the ones with out a gps combo on there boat and it might come in handy for charting when out with a guide on the great lakes
657867,west lake charlie,2012-01-18 22:19:00,40,i bought this app as soon as I got my i phone 3 years ago. its great. I especially like it to study lakes or show  buddies structure where I've fished on monday after a good trip.
658237,trapshooter,2012-01-19 22:17:00,1234,"Can someone check if it has the lakes around Sioux Lookout, Ontario.  Lac Seul, Minnitaki etc?  Thanks."
658270,Grimace,2012-01-19 23:54:00,2020,  I just checked.  Really good lines for Lac Seul.    You're good to go!
658478,trapshooter,2012-01-20 16:14:00,1234,Thanks Grimace!
436498,Aaron Shirley,2010-02-24 14:31:00,655,"Just curious, as I know lots of anglers with Blackberry's, but only one angler with an iPhone.  What kind of cell phone or smartphone do you have?  If you have an iPhone, you will want to check this link out! Navionics Mobile  Aaron"

436549,mistaredone,2010-02-24 16:49:00,913,Also had it for a year.  Paid $9.99!!!  Best money I have ever spent.
436550,cityfisher,2010-02-24 16:56:00,959,wow ... never knew about it. I think i might have to buy it. Does it have all southern ontario maps ? simcoe/ gbay / kawarthas /haliburton
436581,Stoty,2010-02-24 18:15:00,2910,"I believe it does.  I have the ""Great Lakes"" one as well as the ""Canada"" one."
436582,DRIFTER_016,2010-02-24 18:16:00,10439,  They have one for all of southern Canada.  Navionics Mobile Canadian Lakes
436596,diggyj,2010-02-24 18:52:00,548,"I heard from friends that the Canada App is a waste of money. Lots of lakes missing. Not a lot of detail for Lake Ontario. Im curious if it has Simcoe, Scugog, Rice, etc...I would buy if it has Rice Lake for sure.  I sent Navionics an email requesting a complete list before I purchase but they never got back to me so I guess I will not purchase at this point in time.  Dirk"
436609,lookinforwalleye,2010-02-24 19:17:00,4399,"My Son has an i phone and he downloaded the app and we used it on Balsam Lake last year what I noticed is the GPS function would not work while the boat was going, other than that it was okay given the price.  I wish there was something similar for Blackberry."

436701,BillM,2010-02-25 00:04:00,17367," The iPhone doesn't have a true standalone GPS receiver..  It still needs a data signal in order to triangulate your position.  It has aGPS, which is useless out in the boonies."
436736,lookinforwalleye,2010-02-25 00:54:00,4399, That would explain it I guess!!
436764,DRIFTER_016,2010-02-25 01:43:00,10439,  Really?? How does it do at recieving email from a Blackberry business server?? The iphone can't do what a Blackberry can in the business world. They are pretty cool  personal phones though.
436895,diggyj,2010-02-25 15:34:00,548,"I was recently discussing this topic about Navionics for iPhone with a friend and he told me that if your iPhone is jailbroken, you can add an external Bluetooth GPS so you can get a much more accurate position fix.  I had a 2G iPhone but recently bought a new 3GS iPhone and I refuse to jailbreak as I was tired of always rebooting and nuking it when something went wrong.  If anyone wants the link, PM me as it is on another site. Apparantly the fix works great.  Dirk"

533871,scugpg,2011-01-02 17:48:00,1373,"I see this has came out for android based phones as well.  If someone was only interested in the Trent-Severn (which both chips have), which would be better in theory? The Mobile Lakes, or Mobile Marine? I see the Lakes version has HD maps of some Kawartha lakes, not sure if that is included in the Marine one.  Lakes Marine"
533896,Gregoire,2011-01-02 18:47:00,1397, Just took a quick look at the Canada lakes app. It seems to cover most to the Trent to the bay of Quinte
533900,bdox,2011-01-02 19:16:00,329,That is 100% incorrect. iPhone Gps works independent of a cell signal. All agps does is help triangulate when you're indoors or other times when it can't reach the sat. It also speeds up location when a cell signal is available.
533948,ColdH20guy,2011-01-02 20:42:00,312,"Hi guys I have the Samsung Galaxy Smartphone (Android) and love it so far...I have never had an iphone so I cant compare it to them or say it is better etc; I just like mine alot right now.  I too saw the Navionics app but it didnt really expand as to what it included..it was either 'Great Lakes' or 'Canada'..I am also interested in areas around Couchiching, Simcoe, 6 mile, Sparrow etc.. I think the app is around $13 so I wanted to find out if the above lakes are covered somewhere in detail before I purchased it..  thanks guys for any thoughts..good topic"
533953,Gregoire,2011-01-02 20:56:00,1397,On my iphone I have the great lakes and the canada app. The great lakes app only covers the great lakes. The canada app has a lot of the lakes in southern ontario. I just checked and all the lakes you mentioned are covered. A lot of the smaller lakes are not included though.
533956,ColdH20guy,2011-01-02 21:01:00,312,thanks Greg cheers Rich  (the navionics web site says the Great Lakes one covers the Trent Severn? hope Im not getting confused..but it wouldnt take much lol
