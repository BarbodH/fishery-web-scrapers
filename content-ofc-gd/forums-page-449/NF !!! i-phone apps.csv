658263,bullybass,2012-01-19 23:31:00,144,    You should try soundhound instead of shazam. It is faster and gives you the lyrics in a karaoke style. Very cool app.

658401,GYPSY400,2012-01-20 10:53:00,191,"  Yuuuup I agree.. I would also add Kijiji, future shop and best buy to the list if you like buying stuff..  ifish Ontario is pretty good for finding lakes ( only lakes) too. If you don't have a GPS, then add Motion-X and Motion-X drive as well as a topo map app simply called ""Canada""..  The built in GPS works pretty good.  Beware that when running GPS that the battery depletes stupid fast so you have to have it plugged in or not leave the app on when you don't need it.."
