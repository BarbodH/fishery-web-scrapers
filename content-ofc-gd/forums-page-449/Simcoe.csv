658292,bobowski,2012-01-20 00:43:00,360,"Hello, Im going out to Cooks Bay tomorrow to do some Perchin. I was planning on setting up a dead bait tip up while im jigging for Perch. I want to use a big baitfish to try and entice a Pike to hit. My question is, am I able to use a frozen Herring purchased from the Grocery store? I know that the lake is closed to herring fishing all year around but I wasn't sure if i could use it as a dead bait."
658294,Raf,2012-01-20 00:47:00,3495,"yes, store bought is fine"
658345,Fang,2012-01-20 02:23:00,1330,"Most No Frills will sell a decent selection of whole frozen sardines, and such. we use them all the time for trout and pike"
658425,Billy Bob,2012-01-20 12:40:00,5865,Get a few perch....fillet the belly meat off and there's your bait...
658427,DanD,2012-01-20 12:55:00,2223," Iâ€™m not contradicting just asking, is it legal to use in-part or whole a sport fish for bait? Is perch considered a sport fish? I know people use the eyes from perch; but never thought of its legality before. I know I could look it up; but someone here will know.  Dan."
658789,Billy Bob,2012-01-21 17:02:00,5865,I guess nobody knows...
658802,BillM,2012-01-21 18:19:00,17367,"Perch are a sportfish, they're in the regs."
658846,Locnar,2012-01-21 21:38:00,645,How do you hook the dead bait? through the back behind the dorsal fin? or through the head?
658852,Billy Bob,2012-01-21 21:45:00,5865, Here in NYS and everywhere they are considered a pan fish...you sure Ontario has them classified as a 'sport fish'...

658866,wallacio,2012-01-21 22:13:00,475,"Herring which is sold in stores is a true Herring (usually caught in the Atlantic Ocean) and can be legally used for bait if dead.   The ""Herring"" that you are referring to as having a closed season on Simcoe is a completely different species which is closely related to Whitefish.   It's also commonly known as a ""Cisco""."
658881,Rod Caster,2012-01-21 22:35:00,5784,"  It's just a term for any fish that has ""regs"" applied to it. For example herring have no catch limits (at least not in my FMZ), so their not considered a sport fish. I guess a herring is just a ""fish""  . Non-sport fish can be used as bait as a whole unit.. like fallfish or mooneye etc. You can't put a perch on a hook, but from what some have said here, you can use the non-meat parts of a perch for bait. Someone please correct me if I'm off."
658890,BillM,2012-01-21 22:51:00,17367, No distinction between panfish and sport fish in the regs.
658908,Billy Bob,2012-01-21 23:27:00,5865,Here in NYS for example you can sell pan fish but not game fish...and then there is rough fish....AND of course last and least trout/salmon....LOL...
659146,skeeter,2012-01-22 18:56:00,1907,"The last time I was down that way fishing for pike, the guy I went with was using minnows that were 11"" long. And they worked great."
