658801,misfish,2012-01-21 18:18:00,29133,"Plans for a couple of us to hit the hard water was planned for today,but things happen,so it was a solo trip.Get to the lake and no ones there,guess when you arrive at 5:30am,it,sd to be expected.  Getting back into my keaner ways.LOL  Short drag out with the hut,set up and wait for the bite. It started to get busy around 7ish.  Sleepers I guess.LOL  Any ways,managed only one wee tiny eye (which was released to grow) for my 6 hour outing.  I poped abunch of hole to make up for not getting the use out of my gas auger last season.Sure glad I brought it as the ice was pretty much 11-12 inches.  Didnt matter though,the weather was perfect and even got a bit of a sun burn on the face.  I do though,need to look into getting a machine. The knees cant take the dragging like they use to.Yayaya I know,getting old.LOL  The forcast for sunday looks like a trip to the river.    <embed width=""600"" height=""361"" type=""application/x-shockwave-flash"" allowFullscreen=""true"" allowNetworking=""all"" wmode=""transparent"" src=""http://static.photobucket.com/player.swf"" flashvars=""file=http%3A%2F%2Fvid1234.photobucket.com%2Falbums%2Fff417%2Fbrianb64%2Ficefishing2012002-4.mp4"">  "
