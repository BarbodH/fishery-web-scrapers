Plus when your done you could probably chuck it in the lake and leave no embers or hotspots to re-ignite.  Check it out...  http://www.coolcrack.com/2012/01/finnish-stove.html"
658048,Big Cliff,2012-01-19 13:52:00,6899,Now that was smart! Thanks for posting it!
658057,Skipper D,2012-01-19 14:15:00,1970,"Thats awsome , have to give it a try ."
658064,fishindevil,2012-01-19 14:38:00,6254,thats sick !!
658068,Lip-ripper,2012-01-19 14:48:00,228,"Nice, I've seen one of these in action... works well. A variation of it had 4 nails, hammered part way into the top of it to keep the frying pan up off the wood for more even heat."
658076,NAW,2012-01-19 15:13:00,4022,Do you need a little gas on the paper to get it fired up like that?  Or just a really dry peace of wood.
658080,BillM,2012-01-19 15:18:00,17367,"Throwing that in the lake would lead to a fine..  There's a reason why you can't have a fire ON the ice during the winter, all that crap goes into the water once the ice melts."
658086,fish_fishburn,2012-01-19 15:33:00,1311,What crap?
658088,Lip-ripper,2012-01-19 15:35:00,228, Asked a CO that that very question while he was checking us last year... yes you can. Not supposed to leave half-burnt logs on the ice though.
658091,BillM,2012-01-19 15:41:00,17367," Funny, the CO I talked to while ice fishing in Huntsville last year said the opposite.  No fires on the lake, it's gotta be on shore."
658098,Lip-ripper,2012-01-19 15:48:00,228," Typical, I wish they would be consistent."
658124,BillM,2012-01-19 16:42:00,17367, Tell me about it..   Kinda scary if you think of it..
658207,Fishnwire,2012-01-19 21:14:00,983,  Would you face a fine for throwing a chunk of wood that isn't/never was on fire in the lake?  I don't think so...so why would a little carbon make any difference?
658236,BillM,2012-01-19 22:16:00,17367," I don't make the rules, ask your local CO."
658245,irishfield,2012-01-19 22:27:00,26272,On the books as adding sediment/debris to a water body. At the discression of the person with the violation pad!
658288,walleyejigger,2012-01-20 00:35:00,876,"little skeptical but ill be trying it,  i'm with irishfield, i've had open fires on lakes and been checked by mnr and they didnt say anything, once i had brought a barrel out with me and then a different CO said to make sure i pick up the ashes that fall out."
658416,Fishnwire,2012-01-20 12:14:00,983,"I think the ""no fire on the ice"" rule has to do with debris presenting a hazard to snowmobilers, and it being unsightly.  Just like I could throw a chunk of wood in the open water, regardless of whether or not its burnt...I couldn't leave chunks of wood on hard water, regardless of whether or not they are burnt.  It wouldn't be the first time I was wrong...I'll ask a CO next time I see one."
658421,Billy Bob,2012-01-20 12:27:00,5865,"That has to be one extremely piece of DRY wood to pull that off.....  And since it may be against the ""code"" to throw it in the water....toss it back into the woods where it came from....LOL..."
658428,Rizzo,2012-01-20 12:56:00,4754,very neat...or just eat em up raw like I do
658500,BillM,2012-01-20 18:50:00,17367," It's got nothing to do with snowmobilers, it's got to do with leaving debris in the lake once the ice melts.   It's pollution plain and simple, even if you think it's just a piece of wood."
658503,Rod Caster,2012-01-20 18:58:00,5784," Quite true... Although its technically not polluting, its littering. You can get fined for littering with an apple core or banana peel as well.  Either way, I'll have to try this finnish stove some day, its deliciously simple!"
658504,BillM,2012-01-20 19:06:00,17367,"The stove idea sounds awesome.  Easy to carry, gets super hot...  Might have to pack one the next time I take the sled into a back lake!"
658556,Billy Bob,2012-01-20 21:48:00,5865," If I was you I would bring some kind of starting materiel...not just a piece of newspaper....especially in the cold winter....lighter fluid, although I hate the stuff, might be in order if you want to eat a hot meal..."
659159,skeeter,2012-01-22 19:18:00,1907,"I like that. hot idea, but it might be a bit heavier then a coleman stove."
