658788,Spiel,2012-01-21 17:02:00,9065," Thank you.  I can't take any credit for the beautiful wood seats, they're done by my buddy John @ jccustomtackle      I've been working on my own seats with some help from John, though I've been unable to progress much due to a broken wrist and a couple of fingers.....  But I did these with some practice wood, still in the rough stages though.       Here's a few pictures of one I sent to BC last week for member ""Bare foot wader"" who wanted a removable/add weighted butt cap system.              "
658799,Squid,2012-01-21 18:08:00,1656,Really nice work Chris!! I will swing by later in the winter for some guide repairs on my walleye rods.
658804,misfish,2012-01-21 18:31:00,29133,"Those handles would make a great pipe. Just say,n."
658807,Roy,2012-01-21 18:44:00,13728," And even better duck calls, eh?"
658808,misfish,2012-01-21 18:46:00,29133,LOL Ya them too.
658810,Spiel,2012-01-21 18:51:00,9065, Quack....    Quack.
658813,Spiel,2012-01-21 18:57:00,9065, You know where to find me Pete.
658819,spinnerdoc,2012-01-21 19:26:00,556,Chris does nice work...and to pair that with awesome customer service...can't beat that. Here's one of his handy work...     
658833,mercman,2012-01-21 20:30:00,7054, I don't know Chris. Looks like you have the technique down perfectly. Theres something about a fine piece of hardwood. Each piece has its own personality. Your work brings the personality out of that piece of wood. Very nicely done.
658527,Spiel,2012-01-20 20:23:00,9065,Just a few pictures of what I've been working on the last few weeks. All rods are now ready for delivery.        
658533,lew,2012-01-20 20:29:00,12766,Awesome work as always Chris !!
658537,asdve23rveavwa,2012-01-20 20:46:00,2690,Absolutely beautiful work.
658538,Roy,2012-01-20 20:51:00,13728,Can't wait to see my new one in the spring! wooooooooooohoooooooooooo! You do fantastic work my friend.
658541,kickingfrog,2012-01-20 20:57:00,8333,I will place an order one day.
658544,Twocoda,2012-01-20 21:09:00,4130,sexsay!...very nice...i would be scared to use it ...
658548,Jet,2012-01-20 21:27:00,364,Beautiful work Spiel!
658554,aplumma,2012-01-20 21:42:00,6896,Nice work as usual but none of them are the one I ordered.....Springs coming....just sayin.   Art
658558,Wolf 3,2012-01-20 21:49:00,134,Beautiful rods.  Awesome work.
658559,misfish,2012-01-20 21:55:00,29133,I knew this address on my cork board was for something.  Very nice work Chris.
658560,c_shep,2012-01-20 21:58:00,4,Nice clean work! Ches
658561,Gerritt,2012-01-20 22:04:00,6129,"Having seen all these rods... and looking at and critiquing each one (Hey Gerritt, Look at this one... what do you think? during each step of the process..) I have to say they are all going to make some fishermen pretty happy... I think I will take the GLX....    :Gonefishing:  :asshat:  :unsure:  :rolleyes:  :clapping:  :whistling:  :thumbsup_anim:  G."
658566,Leecher,2012-01-20 22:26:00,7832,Awesome craftsmanship Chris
658573,Joey,2012-01-20 23:06:00,9122,Just beautiful work Chris.  I'm impressed
658574,FUSION,2012-01-20 23:09:00,81,One of those wouldn't be mine bye chance would it?
658576,solopaddler,2012-01-20 23:20:00,8605,"Hey Chris, the quality of the cork on what I'm assuming is the GLX handle (those are Ferg's spec's  ) is exponentially better.  That's the quality of cork I want on my handle.  Now please perform a miracle and find me some LOL!"
658587,esoxansteel,2012-01-21 00:40:00,1307,"Fantastic work once again Chris, you build rods with the passion, and attention to detail, like you were building them for yourself, for anyone looking for a great builder Speils your man, the CTS I have, that you originally built for Solo, is a real pleasure to fish, and comforting knowing that your hands put it together.  "
658591,BillM,2012-01-21 00:46:00,17367,"That GLX prototype is slick, Ferg is going to LOVE that rod!!!   I'll make sure to steal it from him for a few drifts  I'm looking forward to Mike's review of the new 2pc 13' CTS."
658731,Spiel,2012-01-21 11:53:00,9065,"Thanks everyone. I really enjoy doing the handle work, it's the guide winding and finishing that I abhor but you can't fish 'em without guides.    Ya ya!    Sorry Fusion, still waiting for my big cork order.    As noted above Mike, still waiting, hopefully it's a good or better. If I recall Ferg supplied that cork and it was exceptional!    It is nice Bill and Ferg keeps reminding me it's one of only 10 out there."
658739,Rich Clemens,2012-01-21 12:32:00,3131,Ya know.   If I would ever switch over to the baitcasting reels .. I'd need to have a couple of those.   Great work Chris.
658740,Roy,2012-01-21 12:40:00,13728," Spiel has made me some really nice spinning rods too, Rich. Just sayin'."
658742,Fish Farmer,2012-01-21 13:13:00,2234,"Nice work, can't wait to see the minnows scales on those handles Bet you can't catch Sheep-head on those rods. Did you say you wanted me to autograph them Chris Good work as usual Chris Just the Farmer pulling your chain."
658760,Rich Clemens,2012-01-21 14:21:00,3131,"  The ones I've seen, they all show great craftmanship."
658762,Spiel,2012-01-21 14:26:00,9065," Thanks Rich  The ones pictured are all Steelhead/Floatrods. The top one is a 15' CTS Second one a 13"" Loomis GLX strip and rebuild Followed by 2 more CTS' at 13.5'  Seems to be a big demand for steelhead rods."
658771,mercman,2012-01-21 15:41:00,7054,"For what its worth Chris, those are some of the finest looking rods i have seen. It must require a steady, confident hand to achieve the workmanship displayed in those rods."
