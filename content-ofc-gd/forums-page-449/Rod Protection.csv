658123,Billy Bob,2012-01-19 16:36:00,5865, The winner gets the worms....  All you get is a at a boy...
658128,Dontcryformejanhrdina,2012-01-19 16:46:00,535,"I broke a bass rod this year when a gust of strong wind blew my little 14' aluminum and I lost my balence and stepped off the seat......right onto my rod. I've got a much wider/more stable 16' now so hopefully it won't happen again, but I have 2 slots on each side of the boat where I can put rods. The pvc tubes vertically would be a good idea but I don't want rods vertically on my boat while musky fishing as they get in the way if I need to walk around the boat at all.  The boat came with 9' downrigging rods so I can fit up to 9' rods there. Good thing cause I want to buy a 9' St. Croix big nasty, and it can't fit in my truck (8' rod just barely fits across the bed of my truck)."
658177,Skipper D,2012-01-19 19:43:00,1970,"I have to say upright tube rod holders work well for me except for when i get the morning coffees , fishing rods don't like low over hangs above the drive thru's , no sir they don't ."
658181,mercman,2012-01-19 19:55:00,7054,"  Dang, my ranger only has a 6ft box.Still trying to figure out how to transport 7 footers No problem when i am towing the boat. Only when i am fishing with some else, without my boat.  I see 2 piece rods in my future."
658185,Skipper D,2012-01-19 20:04:00,1970,  You bring your boat up here one day Paul and i'll show you how to fit those seven footers in that six foot box .
658186,manitoubass2,2012-01-19 20:09:00,11391,left corner to right corner? Or is it vise versa?  lol
658188,Skipper D,2012-01-19 20:13:00,1970,"  I was gona taunt him a bit and say , they don't call me Mr Watch This ! for nothing ........ lol ."
658191,mercman,2012-01-19 20:24:00,7054,  enlighten me
658193,manitoubass2,2012-01-19 20:30:00,11391, the box is longer corner to opposing corner.
658204,jedimaster,2012-01-19 21:03:00,3472,"Cut a hula hoop in half and insert the end of the rod into the hula hoop and jam her in there., 2 rods per hula hoop half or 4 rods per hula hoop.... I assume no liability for anything that you do with this advice."
658224,mercman,2012-01-19 21:42:00,7054,  Thats right !! i was never too good in geometry
658242,Skipper D,2012-01-19 22:22:00,1970,"  Correct me if i am wrong , Acording to geometery in order for it to work corner to corner the box would have to be farly wide , Pauls storage box might be to narrow for that trick . Sorry but i just had to get that off the brain ."
658246,manitoubass2,2012-01-19 22:32:00,11391," Perhaps, tough to know without a picture...  I had assumed by ""box"", he was referring to the bed of his truck???  Maybe I'm wrong???  But if he was referring to the back of his truck, its probably about 75"" long and around 60"" wide. If that was the case, he could fit a rod corner to corner of about 90"" or so   "
658250,Dontcryformejanhrdina,2012-01-19 22:57:00,535,"Haha, yeah I only have a 6' box as well. Corner to corner can barely fit my 8' rod and I can easily fit 7'6"" rods in there. Paul you should have no problem with 7' rods. I don't like having anything heavy in my bed (that sounds bad) when I have my rods in their, though (means the tackle box is in the backseat of the truck) 'cause I'm afraid of it sliding around and breaking my rods."
658251,Roy,2012-01-19 22:57:00,13728,Get yourself a pvc tube of appropriate diameter and length. You can also get a cap for each end. Put the rods in there and lay them in the box with the handles against the cab and the tip end leaning on the closed tailgate. Now bungie the suckers in there. They won't move at they'll be safe. Later I'll find a pic of how I keep them on the boat.
658257,Roy,2012-01-19 23:15:00,13728,"And Paul, without having to take the rods out to test what will fit, if you know the length and width of the box, just add the square of the width to the square of the length and take the square root of the answer. Example truck box is 7' long ..squared is 49. Width is 4'...squared is 16. 49 + 16= 65 The square root of 65 is 8.06225774829855. So the hypotenuse or the distance from one corner of the box to the diagonally oposite corner is 8.06225774829855 in other words, an 8' rod will fit in there."
658328,Skipper D,2012-01-20 01:43:00,1970,"  I was thinking this afternoon there had to be a formula to figure that out and who did i know and could call to ask and looky here , i should have known , way ta go Roy ."
658351,mercman,2012-01-20 02:43:00,7054," I was gonna say sumfin, but i don't even understand was i was thinking about thinking before i thought about it, so i won't."
658396,Billy Bob,2012-01-20 10:36:00,5865,"Paul is just giving you guys a ""hard"" time....his rod is a short rod.... ....and his box is a .....well I wouldn't go there this early in the morning....."
658403,wormdunker,2012-01-20 10:59:00,1711,"It's called the pythagarean theorem.  Sounds confusing, but simple. 3 squared + 4 squared = 5  Thanx Roy"
657375,Gregoire,2012-01-17 14:57:00,1397,Didn't want to hijack Garry's thread about the new rod design. One of the things that I kept thining about after reading the thread was how to protect your rods in the boat. It seems to me that these new rods are quite sensitive and it would be worth protecting them any way you can from being tossed around and such. Just wondering what you guys do to protect your rods when they are not being stored...so I guess I am talking about while traveling and while in the boat.
657380,lew,2012-01-17 15:05:00,12766,I've got a rod locker under my front deck plus more  enclosed storage in the side of the boat so everything can be put safely outta the way of clumsy feet when needed.
657415,scugpg,2012-01-17 16:17:00,1373,I like the rod gloves it helps a bit particularly when carrying a few together or in the locker.  I've seen some make tubes to store them upright in the boat.
657436,mercman,2012-01-17 17:18:00,7054,"Rod Glove. Not the cheap nylon that BPS sells. The mesh type is by far the easiest to put on and take off.They come in differnt colors so you can identify your rods easier. I keep mine in racks i bought for the boat, on the opposite side i use to get into and out of the boat. Still haven't found a way to transport a 7ft rod in a truck with a 6ft box though when i am fishing without my boat."
657440,BillM,2012-01-17 17:27:00,17367,"Rod locker on the Lund works great.   I've got a 7ft 1 pc in there without issue, I wanna see if I can get my 8ft 1pc muskie rod in there come spring!"
657446,kickingfrog,2012-01-17 17:40:00,8333,"Of course you could get it in, it might come out as a two piece however.  I like the nylon mesh soxes as well.  And to be honest, if I'm fishin' with someone I don't know I leave a few rods at home."
657482,Gregoire,2012-01-17 19:58:00,1397,"Just to add: I am wondering how carefull you guys are in the boat with your rods...I know this is an area that I have neglected in the past, although I have never had a rod break in the boat. I am just interested about this subject as I find myself buying more expensive equipment and want to make sure that I am taking care of my equipment properly."
657489,jedimaster,2012-01-17 20:10:00,3472,My fishing partner always steps on his rods every tournament. He combats this by buying cheaper rods from Bass pro. In my old grand cherokee I used to have a hanger system I made out of nylon webbing. I stole the idea from a friend that was doing the same in his pathfinder. Int he boat we put golf tubes in the rod locker to keep them seperated from eachother and prevent them from bouncing around.
657502,mercman,2012-01-17 20:51:00,7054,"  My biggest problem, is misjudgeing the distance between my rod tip and obstacles in the boat.I am always wacking something with the tip."
657549,Gregoire,2012-01-17 23:16:00,1397,I always seem to be wacking the tips of my rods and am worried that I am damaging them. It's just funny for me to see the pros on the shows throwing around rods but I guess that is easy to do if you aren't paying for the rods. I guess I am also wondering how careful you guys are handling your rods in the boat especially if you have a bunch with you.
657552,mercman,2012-01-17 23:27:00,7054,"My boat is 16Ft so i seldom fish with more than 2 other people.Most often just 1. I bought a second set of rod holders, attached to the front of the console, When in the boat, and when i am changing places, i use them, to keep my rods standing straight up. For me, its key to keep stuff stowed, and keep the deck clear at all times, that way no one is tripping or putting thier feet where they dont belong."
657641,fish_fishburn,2012-01-18 03:40:00,1311,I will take 5 or 6 out of my rod locker and strap them to my front deck. My boat is only a 19 ft so all my rods are IM6 as I tend to step on them once in awhile or more. Positively no work boots in my boat unless its cold out. Soft soles only.
657987,Skipper D,2012-01-19 05:40:00,1970,"  Iknow thease are old school but  they work for me ok , no more broke rods since i put them in . Having them right handy in the spot in the boat where i fish from they give me a place every time to stick the rod while i get the hook out ."
657995,Billy Bob,2012-01-19 09:42:00,5865,"My  Famous Snaggletooth Redneck GRUMMAN (Voted Best Boat BTW) was ordered with a 7.5' rod locker to protect my rods...  (see pic) ....it can hold 7 rods total...but just as Skip has posted above you will notice the PVC rod holders all around my vessel....when a fish is landed I put said rod in one of the white rod holders...this gives me two hands to remove the hook from the fish all while not having the worry of stepping on a expensive rod....I have most of my partners trained now to do the same...and the best part was, FREE....since I had the scrap material laying around. "
658013,Skipper D,2012-01-19 11:53:00,1970," Harold  why is it  i find my self lauhing looking at your picture ? I am serious .......theres nothing wrong with the picture and  it was an excellent reply ..... so why am i laughing , you have to help me out here ! ll"
658015,Billy Bob,2012-01-19 12:02:00,5865, Skippy.....have you been hitting the hard stuff again...spiking the morning coffee have you...
658016,Skipper D,2012-01-19 12:15:00,1970,"  No No , but i think i've got it figured out now , looking at the hight of that dock and seeing where the level off the floor isfor the boat , and if not how you got out , or how is it your gona get in  ,you ain't that tall  is whats making me laugh ........... lol"
658017,Billy Bob,2012-01-19 12:20:00,5865,"EASY PEASY Skippy.........one step on the port side gunnel then one step onto my casting platform and finally the last step into the main part of the vessel... the front of my boat from the windshield forward is about 8"" higher then the rest of the floor....from that picture you can't see it but that also contains my 22 gallon live well.  Voted Best Fishing Boat EVER...."
658018,Skipper D,2012-01-19 12:28:00,1970,"  My mistake , any how theres one good idea for holding the rods up out of the way . And am still laughing ."
658021,Billy Bob,2012-01-19 12:33:00,5865,BTW......does ANYONE recognize that dock I'm tied up to.....  1 dozen nightcrawlers to the first angler to identify it...
658102,jedimaster,2012-01-19 15:56:00,3472,"Looks like the docks on Sturgeon lake. Rod storage depends on the boat. in our 21foot bass boat they go in the locker or strapped to the decks. at the bigining of a tournament we have about 4 rods each out, by the end we have about 30 rods out at least. In my tin boat i used to leave them in the vertical rod holders until I had a musky run under my boat and I tried to sweep around to the other side of the boat and caught reel on one of the rods that was up vertical and it opened the bail... man did that musky go for a swim. I managed to land it a 43"" musky on pigeon river, but that was the last time I stored rods upright."
658106,Billy Bob,2012-01-19 16:03:00,5865, CLOSE....need a more descriptive answer to win the worms....

658116,Billy Bob,2012-01-19 16:22:00,5865,RIGHT on the camera....WRONG on the location....so no worms for you...come back one year....
