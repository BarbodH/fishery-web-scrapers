658275,BillM,2012-01-20 00:05:00,17367,Let's hope they turn it around tonight!
658386,tb4me,2012-01-20 05:05:00,3295,Well it would appear that they managed to turn things around..4-1..Nice. The Leafs are 13 for 13 and perfect on the PK in 2012. Have yet to get a goal against in 13 pk situations. Im thinking we still need to move a player or 2 and im almost 100% positive Burke will..Go Leafs Go...Good game by the Monster too. Im a happy Leafer once again..who hoo..
658388,danc,2012-01-20 05:38:00,4677,"I've been watching this thread for the past few days and finally have a few moments to express my opinion. As far as the Phaneuf/Foligno incident, Foligno pulled a cowardly and dangerous move by ducking the Phaneuf check. Who won the fight? Although I'm a Leafs and Phaneuf fan, I'd have to give it to Foligno. Dion can't be turning his head and try to land punches at the same time. You have to show your chin to your opponent in order to get some shots in yourself. Leafs vs. Ottawa? Who cares at this point of the schedule. IMHO, the Leafs should have won this game 10 to 2. But they didn't. They outplayed the Sens big time. We'll see what happens when the games really count. They are amongst the youngest teams in the league and they are making some noise. Good enough for me at this point of time.  Phaneuf from my lens.  "
658534,capt bruce,2012-01-20 20:31:00,820," You got it Bro , HOPE and more HOPE .. and where has all this hopeing got us .. Soon to be 8 years NO PLAY OFFS , back of the line ""NO PLAY OFFS FOR YOU"" , WE NEED A COACH , someone to teach the penalty kill , make some plays to clear our end , give the young guys some direction , all the things a GOOD COACH can do, WHY DO YOU HAVE (PAY) a coach ???? we would be so much better if they just let Dion send out the lines , save money anyway , why pay for DICK ALL ... and who knows what crazy move BURKIE will make to help us ... two more ORRS , duhhhhhh ,Marlies all ready have TOO MANY players of that type ,we  have as I said 6 lines between marlies and lafs of 3 and forth liners , Kes can score, but the other guys ,when hes on the ice can and WILL score too , maybe (sic allways)more than him ... HE (KES ) scores one goal we lose by three .. no brainer hes at best second line material , WE HAVE even if you count LUPAL (returned from the dead) NO FIRST LINE NHL  PLAYERS >>> enough said Im out , GO Boston , or to keep my CANADIAN  Citizenship Van but no play offs for us we is done again ..."
657814,Headhunter,2012-01-18 19:32:00,5703,"Let me start out by saying that I have been a leaf fan for the better part of half a century.... I find it funny that the Sens, who are admittedly in a re-building year, are out classing the Leafs.... the Leafs have by far, the largest front office staff in the league. Those guys don't come cheap. The Leafs have been in the re-building process for at least the last four years. Let's look at the draft picks... Kadri didn't dress last night... the Sens number one guy did. The Leafs claimed Reimer to be the 2nd coming and nick named his ""the Reiminister"". Dude only played just over 40 NHL career games. There was a ton of concern about holding the all star game in Ottawa at the beginning of the season as EVERYONE thought they would be at the bottom of the league this year... and selling tickets would be a chore... well not any more! The Leafs fill the building every night, are valued at around .5 billion dollars yet are still hoping to make the playoffs, after a 7 year absense... So, all that said, I really can't blame Musky Mike for coming on here and stirring things up! It's really pretty easy! Which makes it even sadder, from my perspective! HH"
657823,Pigeontroller,2012-01-18 19:43:00,2793,Its MuskieMatt! He's the guy we should drive to Ottawa and feed him his teeth!!!!
657830,Headhunter,2012-01-18 20:05:00,5703,Ooops...my bad! HH
657841,muskymatt,2012-01-18 20:49:00,2608," Oh come on Dax.....  :clapping:  I'm not so bad and you know it,   a little friendly rivalry is always entertaining. And it's not my fault you chose a team that sucks every year!  OOPs.... did I say that out loud???  My bad...what I meant to say was,actually hold on ,I think it was said already, and by a laff fan....   Music to my ears it is...  :w00t:  :w00t:  :w00t:  And Dax, to meet in the playoffs, the Leafs would have to be there, so far, they are not!"
657862,capt bruce,2012-01-18 22:04:00,820,"  Head you got it right ,could not say it any better ,and Im a few years older ... We need a coach , and some first and second line guys , we have the best third and forth liners in the league (five lines of them ??? ), a decent goalie and a few first liners and god please a COACH.. as it is , we done , done like a chrismas goose ..see us against New york ( a real team )never mind the GO NO WHERE SENS , so sad ,no can do we are just out played out checked out scored out golied out coached , out what ever ..Been a fan for so long , sad sad to see what we have become , WE HAVE Best third and forth lines in the league X 2, too bad about our D and first liners .... NO PLAY OFFS FOR YOU . GET TO THE BACK OF THE LINE ...as if we didnt know , Burk you are so old school the game has left you behind ..."
657914,uglyfish,2012-01-18 23:52:00,981," I have to disagree with both of you. While we are short in solid up front 6 talent, we have connally who is playing very well. Bozak is having a career year and kessel and lupal are playing the best hockey of their careers and are the top pairing in the league.  Goaltending has been very good for a pair of young guys still learning the position. Defense has been the problem. At times its been the best in the league other times the worst. The inconsistency of the back end has been the biggest problem with the leafs. The fact that they haven't really had any secondary scoring has hurt them too. Top 3 power play in the league all year but league worst PK, but, has been showing signs of improvement lately. Coaching is not the problem. Wilson has proven over the years he is capable and proven winner behind the bench. A teams poor play cannot be put on someone NOT on the ice."
657920,jedimaster,2012-01-19 00:15:00,3472,"Outside of the sens game, I like the new lineup with lupal playing with kadri on the third line."
657939,Oggie,2012-01-19 01:30:00,588,"I would sit connolly. He's embarassingly soft and i can t figure out his icetime. Too many leafs don't like to get dirty. Anybody could see they needed to get to anderson the other night but nobody wants to go to the net. Ottawa knew how to get to Riemer. It.s a style of hockey good enough for detroit, the rangers etc."
657960,Live2fish85,2012-01-19 03:04:00,1633,I agree with you Oggie. They needed to get to the net and try and pressure Anderson rather then just shooting the puck at him from behind circle. Lupul looked good and he always gives effort I think grabovski has the bihgest heart on the team makes Kessel look like a little baby out there. As soon as the sens touched the puck the leafs backed off Kessel was the worst. Connoly is also a useless ti+. I think we will see something good out of Burke soon he is going to make a big trade. Hopefully he also gets rid of Wilson to start. He is a garbage coach for the leafs.
657964,kickingfrog,2012-01-19 03:12:00,8333,"Leafs are the second youngest team in the league. Nashville is the youngest, Detroit is the oldest, and looked it against the Leafs a week ago. Ottawa is the tenth youngest."
657988,Pigeontroller,2012-01-19 05:56:00,2793,"Matt, you know how tight the points are in the conference...The standings will change fast again...We will see..."
657989,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2012-01-19 06:24:00,0,you can't round the corners on a rebuild.
658049,Headhunter,2012-01-19 13:54:00,5703,"As I look at today's standing, I see the Leaf's on the outside looking in... so I venture to take a look at which team, ahead of them in the standings, are they going to pass.... it aint lookin good folks! HH"
658051,torco,2012-01-19 14:01:00,656,"Florida is ripe for the picking I think, probably really overachieved early in the season but you are right it is going to be tough when you need to score 4 goals to win a hockey game."
658140,kickingfrog,2012-01-19 17:15:00,8333,"What three goalies? You are making things up. Reimer was the answer, based on half a season. He started perfect this year until he had his brain busted.  The monster had not shown much in 60 odd nhl games.  That's it. No one said squat about depth. There was hope that they had enough.  When you fabricate facts no one will listen to your arguement."
658141,addy79,2012-01-19 17:21:00,573, UGH...
658153,Paulus,2012-01-19 18:03:00,522,"""Ottawa Senators""  ... who cheers for them anyway?  Unless you're from Kanata - because that's really where they play, not Ottawa - you're either a disgruntled Leafs or Habs fan, or you just like the little roman logo on their chests cause it's so cute.  Either way, you're like an ex-girlfriend after a bad break up. You want the house, the dog, the car and for good measure you're also after the rods, the tackle, the bullets and the guns. You want the couch and the king-sized bed. And you want the naked pictures of yourself back. Bottom line: you're not a true fan.  ESPECIALLY, if you live in Toronto.  Also, how many playoff series have the Sens won against the Leafs... hmmm... what IS the stat for that??? uh....   ZERO!  Put THAT in your pipe and schmoke it.  p.-"
658157,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2012-01-19 18:15:00,0, awwwww... living in the past... did a habs fan teach you that trick?
658163,jedimaster,2012-01-19 18:46:00,3472,since the future has yet to be written only the past serves as a lesson.
658187,Pigeontroller,2012-01-19 20:10:00,2793,"In Matt's defense, he lives in Ottawa...Well Nepean but that counts...   Anyone up for a road trip? I'll hold Matt whilst others pummel him into submission!!!"
658215,capt bruce,2012-01-19 21:30:00,820,"We play OK (at times) but just OK , our special teams etc., (AHHHH nothing special there), suck , thats where you need a COACH ... we are so out coached by the better teams ,Wilson , Burk , what you think is a good guy ""Orr "", maybe a good guy, gives you what hes got ( not much) but he has NO place in todays league ,waste of a sweater , love the guy ,hate that hes on our team  , old school ,the league has passed you by , maybe in 1980 NOT NOW ...Again a nother year where I eat my words and let my friends beat me up when I say LEAFS will be there this year ... THere is 11'th ""NO PLAY OFFS FOR YOU""  place. From a die hard super leafs fan , ware blue underware , got a blue leafs tat on my belly ( I know too much info).. Please before I pass on , just once !!!!!"
658220,kickingfrog,2012-01-19 21:36:00,8333,"Power play has been top 3 this season.  The penalty kill has been awful, awful, awful."
658230,Twocoda,2012-01-19 21:55:00,4130,just couldnt resist... 
658271,Oggie,2012-01-19 23:55:00,588,Yup and the coach coaches the penalty kill. It's just basic principles and guys willing to sacrifice. The players' skill level makes the powerplay work.  So Wilson can be blames for the poor PK and the players get the credit for the PP.  Time to show Wilson the door!  He doesn't hold guys accountable. I see Tim Connolly hit the ice even though he's playing like it's a non-contact league.  Kessel is embarassing when the hitting starts. He's looking for a hole under the boards...... if they ever make the playoffs Kessel will be non-existent.  Totorella would strangle some of these guys!  Dan O.
658274,capt bruce,2012-01-20 00:04:00,820,"  X 2  you got it bro , we need some good front office guys, GUYS WITH A PLAN,not just GO GET THEM BOYS , WE THE MAN ???????????"
657637,muskymatt,2012-01-18 03:30:00,2608,"Soooooo.....How are the leafs doing these days?  Seriously though, why is Phaneuf putting himself above the team?  Go Sens Go"
657639,Pigeontroller,2012-01-18 03:33:00,2793,I hate you
657642,kickingfrog,2012-01-18 03:46:00,8333,And just like a stomach virus its back and predictable. Nice to see another excellent post.  Thank you for making this place a little bit better.
657644,muskymatt,2012-01-18 03:53:00,2608,"  Thanks, I can feel the love...  It was out of character for Foligno to do that low check but you have to give him credit for owning up to it.  What happened to all the awesome goaltending the laffs were supposed to have?  Finally the Sens are getting some"
657647,BillM,2012-01-18 04:00:00,17367,"Was that Marchand or Foligno, couldn't tell when he turtled, lol."
657648,muskymatt,2012-01-18 04:07:00,2608," Turtled????? Please!!!!  I say Foligno stood up to Phaneuf and got the better of him, decision Foligno."
657649,BillM,2012-01-18 04:10:00,17367,You've got the eye sight of Ray Charles if you think Foligno won that fight.
657650,Grimace,2012-01-18 04:14:00,2020,"I can not wait for your Senators to come plummeting back to Earth, and when they do I will be like Newman at 0:50 of this clip.  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3zG_PN31YJU  Having said that, MacLean is looking like the Jack Adams Trophy winner.  Too bad.  Everyone (including Eugene Melnick) had Ottawa finishing dead last this year and drafting # 1.  I was really looking forward to watching Ottawa's #1 pick Nail Yakupov walk away from the Sens to play in the KHL.  I guess it is good for the league though.  Not having to play in Ottawa should be enough to keep Yakupov in the NHL.  Bwahahahaha."
657676,muskymatt,2012-01-18 12:50:00,2608,"Hmmm....it's windy, icy, freeking stupidly cold outside, leafs are out of a playoff spot and the SENS are ahead by 9 points....what a beautiful day!!  I did notice that it was very quiet at the ACC during the game. Have the fans already gone into lack of post season submission???  Funny, the Suns Don Brennan referred to it as a morgue....  :rofl2:  :w00t:  The way I see it, with all the feet leaving, flying elbows, stick up checks Phanoof delivers, he's lucky that hits like Folignos don't happen more often.  Season head to head....  SENS 3, Laffs 1(and it was a lucky win)"

657682,bushart,2012-01-18 13:10:00,2628,Matt...Matt..Matt  Don't jinx it buddy  Notice when I got raked over the coals by some leaf fans in November---I coulda come back and got even  But it's still too early--remember sens played 48 and leafs 45 games
657713,Live2fish85,2012-01-18 15:21:00,1633,First off the leafs played like crap and still out played the sens. Then on top of that the refs were garbage. Spezza should have got goaltender interferrence it never should have been a goal. Then Dion gets a pentaly for the fight give me a break. Also Foligno turtled like a little pansy. I do give him credit for fighting after it but I wouldnt say either won the fight they both looked like a joke in the fight.  Also as for the leafs having great goalies I dont recall hearing that ever they just had a better then crap goalie with Riemer and he was good until he got that concusion. He did play garbage last night specaily letting that 3rd goal in but still should have been in overtime if the refs were half decent.
657718,jedimaster,2012-01-18 15:28:00,3472,That was pretty close to clipping and clearly an attempt to do so. Typical of a sens player. Honestly I hope the sens make the play offs so the leafs can shoot them down once again in the first round.
657739,muskymatt,2012-01-18 16:40:00,2608," I've watched the fight 5 times. Where do you see Foligno turtleing???? Is it somewhere between the uppercut, knocking Phanoofs helmet off and the 3 straight lefts to phanoofs chin????    blah, blah reffs were bad,,,blah,blah, blah Spezza interfered,,blah, blah,,,,,  :worthy:    You guys had 3 goalies lined up and touted them all as incredible depth in goal....now it's pick the one who will be the least likely to lose....  :rofl2:  I only say that because the sens had goalie problems since day one, but at least we have a team!"
657741,bushart,2012-01-18 16:45:00,2628,Me thinks you hit that nerve you were drillin for Matt  The Natives are gettin restless

657748,Jigger,2012-01-18 17:06:00,1237,Bait all you want. The 2nd Sens goal shouldve been disallowed.
657751,Live2fish85,2012-01-18 17:09:00,1633, You are a moron re-read my post I never said he turtled in the fight it was the hit he turtled from and if you think that he smoked dion then you sure are like a habs fan.
657784,uglyfish,2012-01-18 18:24:00,981,"only the 3rd goal was reimers fault. thats one he should have stopped. but, even the best goaltenders throughout the history of hockey, have let bad goals in. its a fact of life. the games the leafs have lost, have been a result of poor defence, and lack of offense. not the goalies fault at all.  first goal reimer has a player slide through him, not much he can do on that, second goal spezza should have been called for interference, and there was also the phantom tip he somehow put on the buck after it was kicked to the goal. folignos hit was illegal, it was the same as marchands. should be a suspendable act. He did stand up for himself against phaneuf though, and held his own for sure. hats of to him for that. leafs have to learn better team defence and have players stop making bonehead plays that cost their team, and learn to bury the puck when they get chances. 40 shots on goal, has to account for more then 2 goals. allfredsson is still the dirtiest player in the league, someone should 2 hand him to the side of the head. and the fan voting for allstar games has to end, its a joke. only sen that deserves to be at the game is erik karlson. spezza, alfie and michalik all should be at home watching the game."
657788,Mike Pike,2012-01-18 18:30:00,1332,"Outskatted and outplayed, the Sens were fortnate to come out with the victory in that one, IMHO."

657811,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2012-01-18 19:13:00,0,"leafs definitely outplayed the sens for much of the game (thanks andy) but anybody who thinks phaneuf won that fight should take off their blue glasses.  that fight was the turning point in the game, phaneuf started it, and lost it!  sens got energy after it.  thanks dion."
657813,manitoubass2,2012-01-18 19:30:00,11391,"The Leafs have outplayed alot of teams lately and still lost. In those games, there is usually one or two ""soft"" goals.  IMO that was the case again last night.  Dion is tough, but he sure looks akward fighting. I would call that fight a draw.  And is it just me, or is the battle for playoffs this year gonna be the best ever? I love how tight everything is. One little losing/winning streak can change alot of standings.  Sure is gonna be interesting this spring!"
