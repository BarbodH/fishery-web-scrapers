658409,Billy Bob,2012-01-20 11:14:00,5865, I already new it was Canada.....MANY here do not realize that....but that's not what I asked.
658412,Fishnwire,2012-01-20 11:45:00,983,  Knowing Canada provides more crude to the US than any other country  (not to mention other markets) it makes sense that it would be one of our largest exports...no?

658513,manitoubass2,2012-01-20 19:29:00,11391,"OPEC and the Canadian/American governments will make sure this happens. And OPEC will include the cost of the build to further increase the price per barrel as well.  Canada wants the money and the jobs. United States wants the cheap oil/gas.  They also don't talk much about Canada being their number one provider of oil, because it's much easier to exploit other countries without reaction, then to do so with Canada.  United States can't invade Canada, it would be a relations nightmare. And Canada has everything they need, cheap...  Dr. Sal, I used to work for a major lumber provider in Ontario. No joke, we would cut and treat the lumber for Weyerhaueser. Then ship it to Minnesota. Within a few weeks, the exact bundles would be shipped back to us for building projects(such as Home Makeover).

658518,manitoubass2,2012-01-20 19:36:00,11391,"  How is that gonna happen??? The friggin US controls the FED (central banking system).  Unless the monetary system as a whole is abolished, nothing will change. It's the same with every country under the same system.  All countries create money from thin air (pretty much anywho). Thats how the banking system works, on all levels. You deposit $1000 into an account, within law, gives them the right to create about 10% of that in new money. But on top of that, that $1000 is now used to give someone else a loan. When it's transferred to their account, again, now they can create another 10% of that in new paper money. And so on and so forth.  Inflation, debt etc can never change in this system. The daily increase or decrease makes no difference at all. It can't, because thats just how the monetary system works.

If the U.S., for whatever reason, be it world demand or their own decision, the world is gonna be in a very aggressive state. Remember, other countries are basically owned by the U.S. owned/run FED. There are few exceptions.  Personally though, I want to see the downfall of the monetary system. But wow, if/when that happens, it's going to be quite the change to everyone's way of life.  I've always believed a country should be worth what it has in assets, including natural resources, population and education, and other meaningful assets as well, like contribution to society/science etc.  It's not just the American dollar that devalued either, it's any dollar created under the system. That's inflation, right? Moving forward, the dollar will always be worth less than it was originally. And the FED/central reserve has debts being collected from countries worldwide, correct? Even though there are subtle differences, the worlds market for money is all under a flawed system. So if it is deemed of no value, the whole world is effected, on a drastic scale.  And the last sentence, I completely agree. Very, very hard times are ahead. Sad thing is, that's what has to happen. Another sad thing, we will be affected almost as much as the U.S. will, as unfortunate as that is.  With such complicated issues, the only thing clear is we need drastic change to the system. And with that, we need government to return to the people, not the corporation.  Another sad thing is any change will bring on such a shock to the citizens of all countries, because we are all ignorant to the facts.... A major government crime in history if you ask me  "

Another question is whether or not Canadian producers will be obligated to keep that pipeline filled when they can get a better price elsewhere.

658131,tb4me,2012-01-19 16:56:00,3295,"Its the XL pipeline. We (Canadians) want to run it through Nebraska. Here's the catch, I'm not to sure if your all aware of plan B or not. Plan B will light a fire in the panties of many here on OFC. Its the Enbridge pipeline. It will run from Alberta to the Vancouver coast and be shipped to Asian countries. That quite frankly scares the Hell out of me. One oil spill in that area will have HUGE implication on the salmon fishery. That's just the beginning.We quite frankly have bigger fish (pun intended) to fry right here in Canada. Here's all the links and source info you will need to read up on it...  Last week, Natural Resource Minister Joe Oliver launched a massive public relations offensive to silence Canadians opposed to Enbridge’s Northern Gateway pipeline. His government is trying to manufacture a myth that “foreign special interests” and “radical groups” are “hijacking” the National Energy Board hearings.[1,2]  The federal government’s goal is to ram the pipeline through the public review process despite the fact that it is strongly opposed by Canadians who are concerned the pipeline will kill jobs, destabilize our climate and threaten our coast and salmon rivers. This week, Prime Minister Harper doubled-down on the rhetoric, claiming “foreigners” were “hijacking” the process because they want to make Canada “one giant national park.”[3]  The reality is that there is broad opposition to a pipeline that would pump tar sands crude from Alberta to British Columbia’s rugged coastal waters where it would be loaded onto supertankers destined for overseas markets. Between 75 and 80% of British Columbians, including 2/3rds of BC’s federal Conservatives, oppose supertanker traffic along BC’s coast because of the risk of oil spills.[4] More than 70 First Nations have joined together to protect the economic and ecological integrity of their land and waters by banning the pipeline and supertankers from crossing their territory.[5] Their voices must be heard.  This is a critical moment, the government smear campaign is designed to distract the many Canadians who are learning about this issue for the first time. We need a massive public outcry right now to counter the smear campaign by talking about the real issues.  Please click here to tell Natural Resource Minister Joe Oliver to put Canada’s best interests before oil industry profits and stop the pipeline:  http://www.leadnow.ca/canadas-interests'>http://www.leadnow.ca/canadas-interests'>http://www.leadnow.ca/canadas-interests  Canada needs an honest debate about the future of our energy, economy and environment. Here’s the real question: is it in Canada’s best interests to build this pipeline and expand the tar sands? Building the Enbridge Northern Gateway Pipeline will run counter to Canada’s national interest in four major ways:  The pipeline would kill jobs all across Canada. Regionally, the small number of jobs building and maintaining the pipeline are not worth the risk that oil spills pose to thousands of jobs in fisheries and tourism.[6] Just ask the residents of the Gulf Coast.  Nationally, the pipeline would close factories in Ontario and Quebec. How? For the last ten years, the expansion of tar sands exports has driven up the Canadian dollar, making Canada’s manufacturing exports more expensive and less competitive. This pattern is called the “Dutch Disease,” and in Canada it has contributed to the loss of 627,000 manufacturing jobs in the last nine years. This pipeline will make the situation much worse.[7]  The pipeline would destabilize our climate. We have to choose between expanding the tar sands and preventing runaway global warming.[8]  The pipeline would threaten our coast and salmon rivers. The pipeline would bring 200+ super-tankers a year to some of the most difficult waters in the world, the area that sank the Queen of the North, a large ferry. This creates an unacceptable threat of a major oil spill, and that’s not the only risk. The pipeline will leak. The same day the review panel hearings opened, Enbridge reported a leak in another one of their pipelines.[9]  Over 70 First Nations have banned the pipeline and supertankers from their territory. They have never given up their right to refuse projects, and they are rejecting this project despite significant cash incentives because oil spills are such a major threat to their land and water.  It’s time to speak out. Click here to tell send a message to the Natural Resources Minister Joe Oliver:  http://www.leadnow.ca/canadas-interests  We have a choice to make, and the stake are high. In the debate about the Enbridge pipeline, we can see two competing visions for Canada.  In one, the federal government and oil industry interests work together to exploit our natural resources as quickly as possible, maximizing short-term profits while trashing Canada’s environment, ruining our reputation, killing jobs, eroding our democracy and ensuring catastrophic climate change.  In the other, Canadians work together through democratic processes and an independent regulatory framework to use our oil resources to build a forward-looking renewable energy economy that ensures sustainable prosperity for generations to come while making Canada a leader in the global struggle for climate security.   Right now, there are countless Canadians who are standing up for a positive vision and being smeared by their own government. Let’s stand up with them, and put the focus back on the real issues.
