They usually have minnows for sale but they're not sure yet. Any questions here's their number - 519 843 2979  It's a tough lake to fish through the ice.   Perch, pike, and the odd walleye.  Dan O."
658532,Oggie,2012-01-20 20:28:00,588,My mistake it's $5.50 per person to ice fish.   They do have some minnows at $7.00 a dozen but they're inside the quarantine area so it's hard to find a supplier. Anglers can bring their own though! (Does that make any sense to you?)  One another note please pay to fish. It helps cover the staffing costs and snowplowing. Dan O.
