658567,Shelley Cooper,2012-01-20 22:28:00,394,I have one Brian.. But I'm keeping it.. lol Good luck in your search..
657860,misfish,2012-01-18 22:02:00,29133,"You know the banana shaped jig. For some reason I can find their new style,but it,s not what I want. I cant even find it on thier site. It,s like 2 inches long and banana shaped.  If anyone knows where to buy or of a mold out there,I would be thankful.  B."
657863,Roy,2012-01-18 22:08:00,13728,Have you looked at luremaking.com catalogue online? They have quite a few styles.
657869,kickingfrog,2012-01-18 22:20:00,8333,Is it a jig or a spoon?
657873,GBW,2012-01-18 22:33:00,8460,Brian calls it a SPIG
657874,GBW,2012-01-18 22:33:00,8460,post a pic B with someing there for a ref. like a coin.
657880,Nipfisher,2012-01-18 22:40:00,2449,Is it the rocker minnow?    They stopped making them about 3 years ago. I bought out the last 10 or so from Zellers here in North Bay.
657884,misfish,2012-01-18 22:44:00,29133, Ya 5.99 a peice. NOT      I had a guy years ago make them for me and I painted them myself.
657890,Tom McCutcheon,2012-01-18 22:53:00,627,"I have some of those which I bought from Dennis at Bass Haven on Mitchells Bay a few years ago. My understanding was that he made them himself. I know he is still in business, but I am not sure if he still makes the Jig A Whopper.  Good Luck"
657894,kickingfrog,2012-01-18 23:04:00,8333,"This is what came to mind when I read JIGAWOPPER:    The white one is a knock-off. The other three are genuine and no, you may not have them.  They haven't been made for about ten years."
657922,Nipfisher,2012-01-19 00:23:00,2449,"   I have 3 brand new ones. Blue, pink, and chartruse. I have another blue one that is still in the package. I hae one of the bent ones too. I thought it was a crippled herring?"
657926,cheaptackle,2012-01-19 00:45:00,849,PM sent  Michael
657951,kickingfrog,2012-01-19 02:33:00,8333, They are all bent. I put the one on end to show the profile.  They have JIGAWOPPER imprinted on them.
657954,Nipfisher,2012-01-19 02:40:00,2449,"    O.K. the rocker minnows I have are bent slightly but I didn't think that much. I'll have to check the ""bent"" one I have. I don't think it says jig-a-wopper on it."
657955,pike slayer,2012-01-19 02:40:00,1177,YA I HAVE THE SAME ONES AS KICKINGFROG
657962,mike rousseau,2012-01-19 03:06:00,4661,  Those are popular here...  I'll check the local shop... I'm 99% sure they have them  Might be knock offs... Not sure...but they are banana jigs just like in your picture... With a single through hook..  I think they will ship em too  Any specific colors your looking for?
657986,Skipper D,2012-01-19 05:02:00,1970,"  Mike you could check with Gib , he has'nt left yet to come up , he would be happy to bring them up and i could drop them off to Brian..... just a thought if that worked for every one ."
657998,misfish,2012-01-19 10:05:00,29133,"Thanks Guys.  Ron thats nice of ya,seems I found a guy that knows a guy that has them.  Oh and Rob,may your spud bar go down a hole."
658001,Ice Fishing Ham,2012-01-19 10:20:00,83,I was also looking for Jig-A-Woppers but have had no luck. The kind I'm looking for are in the photo below.    
658010,solopaddler,2012-01-19 11:38:00,8605," Awesome spoon Rob, it's my favourite jigging spoon hands down. I still have a handful left, all well used.     That would be the Hawger spoon I believe. I have a bunch and still use them regularly and they catch fish too.  Sorry I think you'll be fortunate to find a source for these spoons.   Brian those banana shaped jigs are pretty common. I actually think I do have some made by jig a whopper and some other brands as well.  Exactly what sizes do you want? I never use these anymore, whatever I've got you can have."
658012,misfish,2012-01-19 11:43:00,29133," Thanks Mike  Roughly about an inch and a half.  Hands down,they are my favorite ice jig for walleye.   Was going through the online cataloge and found a mold,but it dosent say what size they are,just the weight. Going to give them a call later today."
658145,addy79,2012-01-19 17:30:00,573,1.21 JIGGOWATTS!!!!  
658150,richyb,2012-01-19 17:51:00,774,  I have been looking for this spoon also. Tromblys has them in perch size but I want one in trout / whitie size. I had one years ago and got my first decent laker on it but it seemd to have walked away somewhere.
658168,adempsey,2012-01-19 19:05:00,1498,I stumble across those Hawger spoons every so often at various tackle shops and even TSC.  Never seen a good selection though.  Came across these Jig-a-Whopper lures recently.  They did not come with hooks.    
658180,misfish,2012-01-19 19:52:00,29133,Those are sweet looking.
658203,aplumma,2012-01-19 20:55:00,6896,See if this is what you are looking for Brian jig a whopper .htm P.M. me if you need help getting them up North.   Art
