658244,Joeytier,2012-01-19 22:25:00,3990,Beautiful lab.  My yellow lab stopped being batsh!t crazy at about...6 years old.  I wouldn't have had it any other way.
658290,Raf,2012-01-20 00:40:00,3495,We've a new addition as well.  Meet Lemmy..  
658299,Jewelbee,2012-01-20 00:54:00,422,OMG!!! They are ALL awesome!!!!
658305,Joey,2012-01-20 01:08:00,9122,"Aww Raf, Lemmy is gorgeous.  What kind of dog is it?"
658307,Raf,2012-01-20 01:13:00,3495,"Cocker Spaniel Joey.  Amazing how quick they grow, we got him at 8 weeks at start of December, he was 8lbs, he's gotta be close to 15 now."
658398,Billy Bob,2012-01-20 10:40:00,5865," GREAT looking puppy......we had a cocker spaniel for 13 years ""Alex""....great dogs...  Bob"
658449,Raf,2012-01-20 14:11:00,3495,"Bob, I think he's great too.  Wife on the other hand.. gets to experience his 'greatness' all day, every day.  I've heard they are called velcro dogs and I see why."
658461,asdve23rveavwa,2012-01-20 15:24:00,2690,"Cute pup, Simon!  Love the ""gremlin"" ears in the first shot!"
658480,Billy Bob,2012-01-20 16:23:00,5865," I think ALL puppies are like that....Tundra drives me nuts all day long....  Last weekend my son came how to visit with his 10 week old American Boxer ""Bastion""....the 2 dogs played all weekend together...it was friggen GREAT....Tundra left me alone for the first time in 6 months....then come Sunday Bastion had to leave and Tundra was sad...mooping around the rest of the day....come Monday she was driving me nuts again...."
658753,skeeter,2012-01-21 13:47:00,1907,What a good looking dog Simon!! A friend for a very long time. Now all you need to do is make him a pair of boots with cleats on the bottom for ice fishing.
658775,limeyangler,2012-01-21 16:05:00,5204," Sorry Joey...my wife's comment was not intended to be disrespectful to Ralphie...quite the opposite...she thinks he's adorable....i do too....and yeah....they do get bigger, our neighbours dog Donut is proof....lol.    LOL...i wanna change his name to 'Batsh!t'....that's exactrly how Roloff is....OMG...6 years to go    Awesome pup Raf...i've not seen many black cocker spaniels before...in England there were lots of golden ones.    LOL...our dog is velcro too....he is just tapping at your ankles all day...drives me nuts!   THAT'S IT!....i was trying to think what his ears were reminding me of....you hit the nail on tyhe head....'bright light....bright light'    Our pup also goes to stay at my wife's uncles house. They have 2 dogs of their own and also look after the neighbours dogs....Roloff comes home in a coma after playing there all day...the only time he is not stuck to my ankles....lol.    Thanks Skeets.....poor pup might be getting some dog boots soon.....he lasts about 3 minutes outside before he lets us know his feet are cold.....mind you its minus 35 C here the last few days."
657818,limeyangler,2012-01-18 19:36:00,5204,"Hi all, our 3 month old puppy is growing exponentially, i think he was a puppy for about a week....after that he became 'beast'.               "
657820,Jds63,2012-01-18 19:38:00,1365,"Rolloff has they best place to hang out , thats for sure"
657821,manitoubass2,2012-01-18 19:39:00,11391,thats a good looking beast Simon!
657822,Leecher,2012-01-18 19:42:00,7832,He's certainly growing fast WOW     Still looks adorable
657833,aplumma,2012-01-18 20:14:00,6896,Beast or not he a good lookin feller.   Art
657834,mercman,2012-01-18 20:18:00,7054,the Hound of the Baskervile !!!!! Love that second pic!!!!!   Squirrel!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
657836,mike rousseau,2012-01-18 20:20:00,4661,3rd pic looks like a bear coming at me...
657838,DundasSteelheader,2012-01-18 20:32:00,166,  That is a great picture!
657843,bdox,2012-01-18 21:02:00,329,I also have a 12 week old chocolate lab. Boy do they ever grow fast! We named him Moose when we got him at 7 weeks.
657849,johnnyb,2012-01-18 21:31:00,3413,He's gettin' big allright.....but he's sooooooo cuuuuuuuute
657855,Fishnwire,2012-01-18 21:43:00,983,I'm jealous.  I admit it.  I wish that was my beast.  Cats are OK but if I had a decent yard I've get one just like that.
657857,ChrisK,2012-01-18 21:47:00,2772,Good lookin dog ya got there Simon...
657879,davey buoy,2012-01-18 22:40:00,5505,"Great dog Simon,looks like he's going to have a ruff life.lol:whistling:"
657885,discophish,2012-01-18 22:45:00,392,What an awesome dog you have.  I love the chocolate labs.  Definitely on the top of my list.  Thanks for sharing the pictures ... put a smile on my face for sure.  He's a great looking addition to the fam!
657899,motion,2012-01-18 23:12:00,403,"Hey Simon, looks like he's growing quicly. Can't say I didn't warn you. How's his tounge doing? Betcha he won't be liking cold axes for awhile"
657902,Sinker,2012-01-18 23:15:00,8692,"You think he's a beast now, just wait till he's 90lbs of energy at 7 yrs old. They never grow out of the puppy phase if you ask me. Mine will run all day if I let him. Give him a ball, and someone to throw it, and he's good for all day, no problem.  Its funny, I have a chocolate, and also a cat that looks identical to yours. In my case though, the cat runs the house. The dog could care less until the door opens to go outside......I think then he laughs at the cat!! She stays inside.  S."
657936,Freshtrax,2012-01-19 01:20:00,2215,Great looking dog.  Ihave a olde english rottie cross. I personaly cant stand the smaller breeds
658019,Billy Bob,2012-01-19 12:29:00,5865,"OMG.....the Beast looks like Tundra's twin brother......  Here's Tundra at 4 months....she will be 7 months (if she lives that long...see wife) next week....this is my first Lab and I learned they never stop going and going and going...never stop chewing and chewing and chewing EVERYTHING....and she never wants to stop eating and eating and eating...  And yes, that's a real Mallard I shot earlier that morning. She will retrieve ANYTHING for me..."
658027,Joey,2012-01-19 13:04:00,9122,"Roloff is looking good Simon, and I know what you mean by changing their name.  When Ralphie gets going, I call him Taz, as in Tazmanian Devil"
658059,limeyangler,2012-01-19 14:19:00,5204,"Thanks for the AWESOME replies guys and gals. I left the page up and my wife read through them...she was laughing and 'awwwwing' as she read and at the end she says something like ""wow, those guys are really nice on your fishing thing"".  Thanks folks....appreciated as always.    That's kinda cool. We got our Lab because one of my cats passed away....wait for it....my cat was called...Moose! (my 2 year old renamed him that out of thin air....he was called Oscar)      LOL...dont be too jealous FW.....if you did get one you would have to re-plan your ice hut build and increase its size by at least 125% to accommodate a 'Beast"". I love my cats too, and getting used to a dog...despite how lovely and friendly he is has if i'm honest been and continues to be a challenge...DAILY.....lol.      He healed remarkably quickly thank goodness! And yeah...your warning was not a hoax....lol    OH GOD...what have we done....lol...thanks for the warning of the impending Apocalypse! We have been encouraging our cats to take a round out of him every time he starts...Bert....the black and white cat we have...the bigger one is so awesome....he 'hits' roloff hard but does not use his claws....the small female ginger cat we have does not...Roloff stays way clear of her.....lol.      I am with you....the only small breeds i like are Staffordshire Bull terriers and Scotties.   Thats so cool BB...they are twins. Its too friggin cold here at the moment so we dont stay outside for long...lol...his poor willy was almost frostbit that day in the pics.....he thawed the iceicles off on his blanket....'OUCH'....he's gonna love summer here though....i just noticed the damned dog has WEBBED TOES! talk about a good thing to live on a lake for this dog!    I was hoping you might chime in with a pic or two of Ralphie so as we can check his progress....ooops ....i mean Taz  Or old neighbours had one like Ralphie...iI cant remember it's name...but I called her 'Donut' cuz as soon as she saw us she would freak out barking spinning in circles (doing Donuts).      Once again...cool replies.   Thanks   Simon"
658101,Billy Bob,2012-01-19 15:54:00,5865,"Simon......not only webbed toes but Labs have a Otter Tail for steering while swimming in the water.....at 7 months Tundra is 56 lbs already....I got a female because they are suppose to top off at 65 lbs....but now I'm starting to wonder.... ....Labs were bred in Newfoundland by fishermen to jump off the boat and retrieve the net bouys for them....they are STRONG dogs as I'm sure you finding out....and SMART as a whip...and yes she was named after my truck....because I wanted a big, strong and dependable dog...."
658103,limeyangler,2012-01-19 15:58:00,5204, Thanks for the history lesson Bob....very cool  But i think the 'smart as a whip' gene skipped a generation with poor old Roloff....lololol.
658173,Joey,2012-01-19 19:38:00,9122,"Here's a couple Simon, as per your request  He's 11.7 lbs as of yesterday at the vet.  Started off at 3 lbs when I got him.  This one is of Ralphie with my son Alan at Christmas.      A few more...    "
658184,limeyangler,2012-01-19 20:02:00,5204,  That's awesome Joey....thanks. He's a cute pup for sure.  My wife says he looks very rabbit like in the last pic.
658189,Joey,2012-01-19 20:14:00,9122,"Rabbit like, don't let Paul hear you say that  Ya, sometimes he does look like one, especially with the ears and tail.  That will change tho. Do you watch Modern Family.  Their dog is a French Bulldog.  They really thicken out."
