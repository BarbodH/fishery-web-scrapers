658809,GYPSY400,2012-01-21 18:48:00,191,"I went through the whole furnace thing a couple of years ago.. Got 6 estimates from 6 different furnace installers and the prices were all within $300... A real competitive industry.. So plan on spending between $5500-$6000 if your going to have a furnace contractor do the job.. I now have a Lennox 70,000 btu 95% efficient unit, which replaced a 120,000 btu 50-60% efficient unit. My house took 7 hours for the swap, and that included re-working some duct work and disposal of the old unit."
658825,Fisherman,2012-01-21 19:50:00,7201,"My hovel is 2,000 sq upper and lower and I'm sure mines no more than a 60,000 btu 95% energy efficient with DC motor.  The use of gas dropped by about 30%.  We paid a couple pennies more than $3,000, labour, tax and furnace included and then got back a bunch from the government.  That was just over 3 years ago."
658827,Garnet,2012-01-21 20:03:00,2056,I talked to my furnace cleaner guy last year about this. Buy a Canadian made furnaces designed for our winters. Guess theirs lots of off shore stuff and some of the big names are made in Texas.
658839,danc,2012-01-21 21:12:00,4677,"They don't make anything but high efficient furnaces any more, so you have no choice there. Being in the trade myself, I changed my own furnace last winter. My cost was $1200.00 for the furnace, venting, wiring, gas connection and duct work."
659040,Billy Bob,2012-01-22 11:23:00,5865," It really depends on your insulation you have.....if it's a small bungalow I would think a 50,000 BTU unit would be more then enough."
657179,Gregoire,2012-01-16 22:34:00,1397,When I returned home on Sunday morning the house was unusually cold. Turns out the fan on our 25 year old oil furnace is dead. I was hoping to burn off the oil before swapping the old furnace but looks like that plan is not going to work. The furnace is still working and giving off ambient heat plus we have some space heaters that are doing a good job of keeping the house warm so I can shop around a bit. I'm just wondering how much I should spend on a new gas furnace. Just for a little added info: we live in a bungalow in East York and I am looking for a furnace that qualifies for the Eco audit rebate. I am also looking for a price that includes the the disposal of the old furnace and the oil tank. Any information that you can share with me is greatly appreciated.
657184,DRIFTER_016,2012-01-16 22:37:00,10439,Easy enough to swap out the blower motor and not too expensive either. You can probably even pick up a used one that will do the duty until you run your oil tank dry.
657187,Gregoire,2012-01-16 22:46:00,1397,"I'm afraid that swapping out the motor is beyond my limited ability as a handyman. I did examine that option but it would cost at least a couple of hundred dollars, and that is money I'd rather spend on musky gear."
657190,Billy Bob,2012-01-16 22:50:00,5865, Once you price out the cost of the new furnace and labor AND oil tank removal you might reconsider replacing that blower motor.
657194,Gregoire,2012-01-16 22:56:00,1397,I have the money put away for a new furnace and need to get it done soon to qualify for the Eco audit anyway. I'm just looking for a general guideline as far as cost as I have no knowledge on this topic.
657195,Gerritt,2012-01-16 22:57:00,6129,"replaced mine a few years ago... a friend of mine happens to be in the HVAC business... cost was 1500 for a new Bryant High efficiency, and a bunch of new duct work.... I realize he was doing me a favour as I am in the building industry and have worked with him on several large projects.... but he certainly did not do it for free and still put some dollars in his pocket...  I am posting this just so you can have some idea on the markup of materials and labour....   Now as for your oil tank.... that is a whole other ball of wax.. see if you can sell off the oil remaining... but these tanks are considered a hazardous material in most municipalities.   G."
657204,lew,2012-01-16 23:11:00,12766,"Rather than having a bunch of folks guestimating a price, why not call some furnace companies for an exact cost ??"
657205,Gregoire,2012-01-16 23:11:00,1397,I had a guy in today who quoted me 6 grand for the job. The furnace is a trane xv95 that was quoted at 3900 and the removal of the old furnace and the oil tank is 850. The labour cost are 485. I spent the day on the phone today. I just wanted some input as I have no idea what the differences are between types of furnaces or how much the job should cost.
657207,Billy Bob,2012-01-16 23:19:00,5865,"Those quotes to ""me"" seem high but everything is more in Ontario....so you should keep shopping around...  But you might as well get A/C while your doing it if you plan on staying there."
657209,Gregoire,2012-01-16 23:27:00,1397,That quote seemed high to me as well. I already have A/C so that is one less thing to worry about.
657212,spinnerbaitking,2012-01-16 23:31:00,1622,"I`m not positive on the price but we just got a new Rudd Gas Furnace, old furnace removed, oil hot water tank removed, furnace oil pumped out & oil tank removed for under $5,000.00, don`t even have the bill yet SBK"
657214,Freshtrax,2012-01-16 23:34:00,2215,Hey i just sent an email. Waiting on a reply.  I may have a hookup for ya. I will probably get a reply sometime  tonight
657216,Cookslav,2012-01-16 23:38:00,1457,"Much more info needed to even give a ball park on that... How many sq feet is your home? (The amount of space needed to heat will determin the size of unit required.) Also do you currently have A/C or not (makes a big difference when it comes to the plenum etc.) Do you want humidity control? What kind of control wires are being run (how many wires)  Other things to consider...to get the Eco credit you will need a High effeciency I'd imagine (more $$$$)  As for removal of the oil tank...I have no idea, but it ain't cheap."
657223,Cookslav,2012-01-16 23:44:00,1457,"I see you added this as I was typing LOL!  That Actualy may make your new unit more expensive... You will need a unit that fits your current coils, or have to replace the coils(depending on the age and condition) And it may effect the pricing on a rebuild of a plenum to fit the new unit. Until your estimator see's it its all in the air so as Lew said I'd get 4 quotes and go from there but if your asking me...  How many BTU's are you looking for?"
657231,jonboy,2012-01-16 23:59:00,10,"I have a new scratch and dent Tempstar high efficiency 80 000 Btu for sale , cheap! If interested."
657233,camillj,2012-01-17 00:05:00,1988,I paid about $7K for mine (but it had to be an outdoor unit - dont ask -  and it was also an air-conditioner) ... I thought I was gonna get this great big rebate .. well it turns out the 'seer' wasnt quite where it needed to be ... so NADA ...and less than a year in it started making an unholy-bang when the air-conditioner turned off ... Called Carrier .. and although the 'part' itself is warranteed it was still gonna be about $800 labour - IF - I could find somebody interested in fixing it ... to quote my close friend Yosemite Sam ... OOOH I HATES HVACs !
657234,Gregoire,2012-01-17 00:07:00,1397,I need 60000 btu and an looking for an efficiency rating of 95+. Thanks for all the replies.
657236,Gregoire,2012-01-17 00:09:00,1397,That would be awesome. If it works out you can pm me. Thanks.
657242,Freshtrax,2012-01-17 00:27:00,2215,Just talked to him he said furnace 3500-5000 disposal of old stuff 650. Im gonna pm you his number he said he cvan send someone to lookat it whenever.
657243,Gregoire,2012-01-17 00:29:00,1397,Cool. Thanks
657247,rob v,2012-01-17 00:32:00,535,i think it would also depend on how long you intend to keep the house.  if you're leaving in a year or two you may want to look at something more economical.  if you intend to stay for an extended period than invest in quality
657249,Freshtrax,2012-01-17 00:35:00,2215,I dont know if 60000btus is allot or alittle i diddnt tell him that part
657257,Gregoire,2012-01-17 00:57:00,1397,I have a small bungalow so I assume 60000 is small.
657310,woodenboater,2012-01-17 04:17:00,2277,Not much else to add but go hi efficiency if you can ( is this a condition of the eco deal ?). We got ours a number of years ago and the gas bills dropped like a rock (yeah our old one had done it's job but still). The electrical bill should drop as well with the dc motor. Price difference between mid and hi was negligible in our case.
657321,Cookslav,2012-01-17 04:49:00,1457,"Depending on the quality of the unit and how much aleration of ductwork, plenum, and electrical, refrigeration lines, and drainage is needed I wouldn't pay more then $3200 just say'n cause the unit shouldn't be more then $1300 so the rest is going to be labour to move the lines, and fabricate the ductwork etc...  I'm by no means an expert, but I've done this twice over. Get four quotes and good luck"
