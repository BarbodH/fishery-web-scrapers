658467,Pigeontroller,2012-01-20 15:41:00,2793,Lures like this?  
658468,Raf,2012-01-20 15:44:00,3495,even the ernie or lil ernie gets down fast if we're talking mass produced lures.
658474,Billy Bob,2012-01-20 16:01:00,5865," Lead core, wire, riggers, Great Lake Boards, inline boards, Dipsy Divers, Jets....you name it I have used it to present baits while trolling.....but in this case on this particular spot I want to LONG LINE it because it's not very deep where the walleyes stack up in gin clear water and I want the lure far away from the boat....I know this ridge like the back of my hand and know just where I want to make my turn so the Hot 'N Tot runs over that ridge while by boat NEVER did....sometimes it the little things like this that make all the difference in the fishing world..."
658476,Billy Bob,2012-01-20 16:05:00,5865, The area I am fishing also has heavy current...it's the head of the Niagara River....can't say more then that without spilling the beans on my little hot spot....1.5 to 2.3 is my speeds in that area without any winds....but that area can get nasty with any winds blowing down Lake Erie....and that my friend in walleye time...
658495,Dontcryformejanhrdina,2012-01-20 18:16:00,535,"  The X-Hawg I caught my musky on when I was fishing with you has a metal lip. Granted I was using it as a jerkbait, not trolling it. Funny, earlier in the year I almost lost that lure when it got caught on a log about 10' down while trolling. I had to use my paddle to get it unstuck, could just barely reach it after several tries. I'm glad now I didn't just give up and cut my line."
658501,mike rousseau,2012-01-20 18:54:00,4661,  Key there is that you caught the fish... And I'm pretty sure that's the only one in my boat ever on a metal lip bait...  I know they work... Just not for me...
658649,OhioFisherman,2012-01-21 03:07:00,6623," I used to fish the western basin of Lake Erie with my dad and brother for walleye, Hot n Tots and Wiggle Warts were all we used. 8-10# with just a snap, the metal bills on the Hot n Tots could break loose from the plastic and water would get in the lure killing the action.  The old red label wiggle warts turned into a hot bass lure for me."
658709,Dontcryformejanhrdina,2012-01-21 05:17:00,535, Weird. I've never even thought about what the lip was made of. But of course before last year when all I fished for was LM bass I hated using lures of any kind and rarely gave them a chance.
659162,skeeter,2012-01-22 19:21:00,1907,you would kick yourself if you found out that they were worth a fortune.
658243,tomO,2012-01-19 22:25:00,363,"I have some crank baits with metal lips most have plastic. Are the metals lips for strength or weight ,was just wondering , never really thought about it before."
658258,dave524,2012-01-19 23:19:00,4508,"The first plastic lipped lures I recall were the original Rapalas, late 50's, most lures that predate that were metal lipped, like Jitterbugs, Pikie Minnows, River Runts, probably cause there was no plastic when they were designed. Most of the metal lipped lures are old designs or based on old designs or so it seems to me"
658261,DOS,2012-01-19 23:31:00,119,"The new storm 'hot n tot' cranks have metal lips but not sure why, most of my musky ones also have metal lips, wonder if it has to do with strength?    RED"
658278,BillM,2012-01-20 00:07:00,17367,I've noticed a lot of the saltwater Rapalas have metal lips.  At least the ones in my tacklebox do.
658282,adempsey,2012-01-20 00:20:00,1498,"I know for Hot'n'Tots many people complained when they switched them to plastic lips.    Particularly because when you troll them, the metal lip smacks on the bottom/rocks and is supposed to help elicit a strike.  You can also bend them to change or correct the lure action."
658285,Roy,2012-01-20 00:30:00,13728,I don't think it has anything to do with strength. Most mass produced baits are molded/poured and so the plastic/lexan lip is incorporated in the build. Manually made or assembled baits will often have metal lips because they're much easier to affix to the bait....the lip angle etc is always spot on. I prefer Lexan but it's much more work when it's a manual build.
658318,Rizzo,2012-01-20 01:26:00,4754,"smacking bottom the metal I guess would stand up better, also provides a bit of flash. Having said that, most of the lures I bang bottom with don't have metal lips - jakes, grandmas, believers, depthraiders, hookers etc"
658324,mike rousseau,2012-01-20 01:36:00,4661,Never caught a fish on a metal lipped lure... Don't know why... I've tried then on prime spots without any results...
658355,mercman,2012-01-20 02:58:00,7054,"  i guess it comes down to confidence. When i was a young lad, fishing with Dad, we caught all our fish on metal lipped lures. I dont remember him haveing any plastic lipped, until Rapala came out with their original floating lures.He had alot of lures that had the diving surface carved out of the face of the lure also,no lip at all."
658376,Bob,2012-01-20 03:55:00,370,I picked up a handful of Rapala long cast baits and the salmon loved them but the lips on those things didn't survive more than a couple of fish before the lips broke.
658400,Billy Bob,2012-01-20 10:47:00,5865, We have caught TON of walleyes here on Erie with Hot 'N Tots....the small ones and also the larger size....you should try a couple....walleyes like to almost swallow the smaller size Hot 'N Tots.  http://www.cabelas.com/product/Storm174-Hot-N-Tot-Lure/1164591.uts?Ntk=AllProducts&searchPath=%2Fcatalog%2Fsearch.cmd%3Fform_state%3DsearchForm%26N%3D0%26fsch%3Dtrue%26Ntk%3DAllProducts%26Ntt%3Dhot%2Bn%2Btots%2Blure%26x%3D0%26y%3D0%26WTz_l%3DHeader%253BSearch-All%2BProducts&Ntt=hot+n+tots+lure&WTz_l=Header%3BSearch-All+Products
658404,outllaw,2012-01-20 11:04:00,1232,lure lips that are metal are normally much costlier. as time went on plastics and lexan is the norm.. theres a huge difference between plastic and lexan for lure lips. as for the storm lures hoten-tot and wiggle warts. the actual plastic the lures were built with created changes.. re-cycled plastics does not carry the rattle effects as virgin plastics.
658410,Billy Bob,2012-01-20 11:25:00,5865, Don't know about the new Hot 'N Tots but all the old ones I have don't have rattles....for rattles you had to move up to the Wiggle Warts....back in the day my walleye tournament partner and I did field test studies in the High School pool on these lures...(he's a gym teacher)....Wiggle Warts made a LOT of noise underwater.
658434,OhioFisherman,2012-01-20 13:07:00,6623,http://www.ebay.com/itm/VINTAGE-LURES-LARGE-HUSKY-CISCO-KID-6-LURE-BOX-PAPER-COLOR-PURPLE-BACK-/280807642494?pt=LH_DefaultDomain_0&hash=item416170957e  Caught and lost a lot of good fish on the Georgian Bay.
658437,mike rousseau,2012-01-20 13:21:00,4661,  They don't dive as deep as I like... I like my baits to dig ditches in 15-20FOW
658438,Billy Bob,2012-01-20 13:25:00,5865," OH, they dive that deep....I use the smaller ones long lining at the head of the Niagara River where Erie dumps in....I always scrape bottom on 15-17' ridge that I target for walleyes.....not sure about the larger Hot 'N Tots but they have to go deeper....we only used them off the boards in deep open waters (80'+) for suspend walleyes."
658439,dave524,2012-01-20 13:31:00,4508," Billy Bob and I fish the same end of Erie, mostly suspended fish, Hot n Tot would dive about 10-12 feet when 75 foot back of a cannonball, good stealthy approach. Another lure that worked great eastern Erie was the metal lipped jointed Canadian Wiggler, often with a bit of worm on the front treble in fact it is all metal"
658441,Billy Bob,2012-01-20 13:38:00,5865," I like to run the smaller Hot 'N Tots 6' behind the cannon ball over all those rock piles better know a Waverly Shoals....took a TON of LARGE walleyes off that shoal doing that....it seems that the cannon ball triggers the bite because it moves a lot of water down there....then comes that little Hot 'N Tot right behind it....I could see the fish spike on my graph as we moved over them....We catch a lot of walleyes doing this while everyone else is not doing well there...ESPECIALLY if it's calm....Windmill Point is another one of my hot spots for doing this also....taken some nice 10+ lb walleyes off that point, usually later in the year...August was our peak month at Windmill Point.  Bob"
658443,mike rousseau,2012-01-20 13:39:00,4661,  I'll have to check em out then...
658444,Billy Bob,2012-01-20 13:43:00,5865, Now I'm LONG lining....at least 100' back using only 8# test mono....no other weight used....just a small Berkley cross lock snap is tied on the line....nothing else.  And double check the lure at the side of the boat....sometimes they run off to the side....not good...adjust the metal clip one way or the other AND not too fast or they will roll up on you.  Bob
658445,Billy Bob,2012-01-20 13:45:00,5865,What's nice about using a new type lure is many times no one else is using it and it quickly because the hot lure because the fish haven't seen it much or not at all.
658447,Raf,2012-01-20 14:09:00,3495,"unless you're trolling open water/suspended fish, long lining is not really an option if you're fishing structure and you want pinpoint accuracy.  hence the need for lures with steep dive curves that get down with minimal amount of line."
658448,mike rousseau,2012-01-20 14:09:00,4661, I do between 80-120 feet back on 10lb braid...  And speed may be an issue... I usually run 2-3mph against a 2-5mph current so water speed is 3-8 mph on the lure...
658454,Headhunter,2012-01-20 14:28:00,5703,"And that's why god invented lead core! Typically we use 1/4 oz hotnTots on Quinte in the spring... and using lead core when trolling the flats is an excellent way to dial in the exact depth you want and be able to repeat based on success... in the fall, 1/2 to 3/4 oz HotnTots have also done well... but I gotta admit that I am less than fond of reeling the 3/4 oz in, unless there's a fish on it! HH"
658457,Raf,2012-01-20 14:50:00,3495," you're still fishing with a boat load of line (leadcore) out, 100+' behind the boat.  Making sharp turns to follow contours of structure is impossible.  but it works great if you're just driving in a straight line.  i've lures that are pretty much a 2:1 line out/depth ratio.  ie. 40' line out, 20' deep on wire."
