446420,BFSC Kevin,2010-03-22 17:30:00,1351,:D 12 ft transom sportspal Brand new with warranty $760 ....better than the $850 used one on kijiji.....  
446421,irishfield,2010-03-22 17:33:00,26272,Can't beat that Kevin!! Mind telling me where... as I may need some more for customers wanting canoe loaders on their airplanes.  ..thanks for the PM Kevin..
446422,Terry,2010-03-22 17:40:00,14456,nice score
446425,TJQ,2010-03-22 17:44:00,7806,nice!!!!
446429,BFSC Kevin,2010-03-22 17:50:00,1351,"thanks and np wayne.  nNw to find a motor for it. I was thinking of sticking a 4 or 5hp on it, since that could also double as my kicker on my 16fter. but the max rating on that sportspal is only 2hp...so I might get a 2hp and use that as a kicker. Don't want to get 2 motors."
446430,scugpg,2010-03-22 17:51:00,1373,Wow very nice! I'm interested to know where as well - really want one of these.  Are they really tough to tip compared to say a prospector style canoe?
446437,bushart,2010-03-22 18:07:00,2628,Back trout lakes---Beware!!  Should get good use of that one
446485,Victor,2010-03-22 19:50:00,1609, i JUST talked to you yesterday and I swear you weren't thinking of getting one of these.
446487,tibbs,2010-03-22 19:57:00,650,Sounds like it was a great deal! Congrats on the new boat!
446538,phiphntek,2010-03-22 21:31:00,115,  My 16' Scott Prospector is very stable. Sportspal canoes have always had the built in (and around) closed cell foam floatation.Way more stable.Nice light boat especially with a small motor.    Congrats on the new boat !
446541,Mike the Pike,2010-03-22 21:38:00,3421, Kevin I use a 2hp Honda long shaft for my kicker on my 16ft Lund it does a fine job for trolling.I also plan On getting a sportspal and I will use the long shaft I will just have to be careful in the shallows.  Nice score with the canoe.  MTP
446603,BFSC Kevin,2010-03-22 23:27:00,1351,"Victor - When they told me the price, I drove over to check it out and boat it right away O.o pretty decent price!  MTP - I checked around a tiny bit, I can buy a brand new 4 stroke 2.5hp merc for $850+ tax or a 3.5hp merc for $995+tax(price matching BPS since they sold out already and I don't want to wait 2-3 weeks for them to ship more in)  I'm leaning towards the 3.5hp merc. Weighs 40lbs, 12lbs-ish more than your honda."
446604,asdve23rveavwa,2010-03-22 23:27:00,2690,"Very nice...no better canoe to fish out of, IMO!!  They are so stable, not quick, but, who cares if you are using it for what it is best at!!"
446607,irishfield,2010-03-22 23:32:00,26272,Pretty stable Kevin.. Lloyd spend most of the time I had him on back lakes last September standing up and paddling IN THE BOW!  Now about that motor.. I wouldn't be pushing the 2HP limit !!!!
446608,fish-miester,2010-03-22 23:33:00,864,that thing is a beauty !
446673,BFSC Kevin,2010-03-23 00:43:00,1351, Too heavy? its about only 12 lbs more than a 2hp Too powerful? I won't be going WOT.. only to maneuver around and get to point B from shore Warranty doesn't cover? ummm.. yeah....
446676,irishfield,2010-03-23 00:47:00,26272,"Yes,, yes and yes!  It's not the strongest boat in the world... all 16 thou or less of aluminum that makes it float!!"
446701,asdve23rveavwa,2010-03-23 01:10:00,2690,How about an electric trolling motor?  Although then you have the battery to lug around.  Never did anything but paddle mine.
