447201,archer379,2010-03-23 22:06:00,277,ok so i don't usually rant on boards like this But this just ticks me off. Today while picking garbage along the side of the road i came across a pile of small bags of dog waste they where all the same kind of bag so i can assume they are from the same person unless its a really well trained dog. People seem to think that its better to poop and scoop and then dump the bag and evreything back on the ground. How is this better.  thanks for letting me vent this
447204,smitter,2010-03-23 22:11:00,106,I also find this behavior perplexing.  Around here people bag it and then hang it from the low branches on trees. What's that about?!
447211,FISHINGNUT,2010-03-23 22:22:00,253,When I see people do this kind of thing I usually pick it up and follow them along there walk .After I see where they live they find the doodoo in there mail box the next day and not always in the bag
