446229,lew,2010-03-22 09:41:00,12766,"The new board looks good Rick, thanks for taking the time to set it all up.  Only problem I have so far is when I'm scrolling thru a post it's extremely jerky and almost impossible to keep track of where I am. It's hard to explain but when I'm reading a post and scrolling down it's almost like all the text is flipping over each other, almost as if you were trying to read something thru wavy water........if that makes any sense.  On the main page though, when reading down the list of forum topics, everything scrolls very smoothly.  Any thoughts ??  EDIT++++  OK, something I just realised is that this problem only happens when I'm logged in. When I log out it doesn't happen and the pages scroll very smoothly.  Wierd stuff"

446270,Cast-Away,2010-03-22 12:57:00,790,Awesome job Rick! I really like the new look. I am browsing with Google Chrome and have no issues. This board version seems quite a bit faster than the old one.  Keep up the great work and tell TJ that you want a raise and not his eyebrow!
446300,bigugli,2010-03-22 13:55:00,6138,I'm noticing that some replies get dropped right tp the very bottom of the page leaving a huge blank space tween the last post and latest reply.  My reply to last walleye trip. Dr S's reply to perchin.

445957,bigfish1965,2010-03-21 20:07:00,3382,Maintaining more than two skins is too time consuming. We also were looking for a branded look and this skin was best suited for that.

446024,DRIFTER_016,2010-03-21 22:21:00,10439,Other than a few red X's here and there I have only found one annoying thing so far. That is when I read a post and hit my back button to go back to the previous menu I get a web page expired warning and have to refresh and click on another warning to get back to the page.
446032,bigfish1965,2010-03-21 22:44:00,3382,That's doing the same thing to me so i will look at that. I get a 'resend information' advisory. Probably a session setting but may also be a security feature.
446034,kickingfrog,2010-03-21 22:48:00,8333,Is the calender tab at the top right of the screen a public calender where all members events will be visible (such as: G2Gs) or is it our own private calender(such as: buy condoms)?

446116,Handlebarz,2010-03-22 00:54:00,3790,so far so good hope to have some time to get used to the new stuff
446119,Gerritt,2010-03-22 00:55:00,6129,  It wasn't in the past... I as well as MANY other used that skin... I do not understand why it was ok then but not now?... is it something that can be looked at?
446125,bigfish1965,2010-03-22 01:04:00,3382," Sorry Gerritt, but it was too much before..doing seven edits for each change was a PITA. The Club Skin was by far the most popular, was cached in Google for us and was available in this coding. As far as the future goes..who knows?"
446150,bigugli,2010-03-22 01:51:00,6138,"Wow!! Looks pretty sharp. Being as I am not so computer literate, this might take a little while to figure out.  Where is the machine that goes ""Ping""?"

446192,bigfish1965,2010-03-22 03:40:00,3382," I'm way faster Spiel. Ranging from 0.08 to 0.20 seconds. Update your IE or try another browser and see what happens. We are using the newest AJAX coding so older browsers will suffer. IE6 won't work at all, but it has been dropped by Microsoft into the archives. Early versions of IE7 may have a few issues too. The only way to know what the issue is, is to do something different and see what happens."
445818,Roy,2010-03-21 16:15:00,13728,And we will answer what we know about the new digs. Thanks again Rick for the great job.

445881,irishfield,2010-03-21 17:48:00,26272,Just when I was getting a lot of work done..  In profile... Topics/posts etc is layered overtop of stuff. Also post count in profile doesn't match thread post count (suppose that is from manual overide at last board change).  Edit doesn't work in IP Skin either..
445887,vinnimon,2010-03-21 17:55:00,2593,Good work guys. I kinda miss the old one  But this is nice and clean cut.I was jogging around a few others and its not as good as this one. Fish on and cheers
445890,fishinfool,2010-03-21 18:01:00,366,"Great looking site, way to go guys!!"

445902,irishfield,2010-03-21 18:13:00,26272,  Still stays layered over picture etc... no matter how small you make it.  Take your sweetheart for a walk... all this crap can wait..

445937,Gerritt,2010-03-21 19:28:00,6129,can we have our old skins back? I am really not fond of the default skin.. and the other available skin is horrible..  ?  G

With the profile displayed, I did a right-click and select properties of this window.  Once I do this, IE-7 locks up and I have to user the task manager to end the session."
445952,bigfish1965,2010-03-21 20:03:00,3382,Yeah IE7 locks up alot..lol  The pages are all dynamic and as such trying to get properties will get nothing.
