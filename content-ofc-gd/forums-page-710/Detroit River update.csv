Most anglers fished the Michigan side and south of the Ambassador bridge. Chartruese jigs with real minnows or Gulp minnows caught most of the fish. The water temps are around 36-38 with some warmer water found shallower. The last few days we have had a cold front come in and with it N winds. N winds muddy the Ontario side and having a Michigan license will keep you on the water. More cold weather is forecasted for this wknd and will keep things tough. Look for action to start heating up the 3rd wknd of April as we will have walleyes in all 3 periods of spawn. Also keep a close eye on the water as you drive the river, there will be a number of hazards floating."
