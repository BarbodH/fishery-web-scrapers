446998,scugpg,2010-03-23 17:04:00,1373,I want to get out on Lake Erie this summer and I'm thinking of trying out the Torpedo divers. Saw some pretty cool tips under his site http://www.torpedodivers.com/videos.asp  They look pretty easy to setup; has anyone used them? I might even give them a shot on some inland lakes I fish for walleye for deep trolling.

This opened the door for so many practical uses. One hot ticket is to clip on behind 3-4 colours of lead and sink to your desired depth. This gives you the leadcore action without having to reel in 5-10 colours of lead and more predictable depths. I've yet to try the directional torpedo's but I suspect they will be just as easy to use."
