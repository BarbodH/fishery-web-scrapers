446942,troutologist,2010-03-23 14:51:00,951,"Luc did you find that hole I was talking about? You can fish it from the high side but its an easier cast and the evening sun is less of an issue on the other side.  Great mid afternoon hole too, thats where they seem to drop into coming up or if the big hole gets worked hard.  I can't wait to go steelheading!!!"
446949,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2010-03-23 15:10:00,0, Some spinning guys were in that area for the first bit so I never got over there.  Definitely would have been relief from that evening sun.  The fish in that run were actually coming from well downstream where your line sweeps hard left into the tailout on really long drifts..
446950,troutologist,2010-03-23 15:15:00,951,"Thats very close to the spot, where it pushes left. Sun is brutal there with no leaves on the trees..."
446954,Dara,2010-03-23 15:23:00,3052,Nice pink
446959,Kinger,2010-03-23 15:42:00,351,"Great report as usual, the email was great.  In 7 days I am gonna get my first steelhead ever, come on waders!!!"
446975,TDunn,2010-03-23 16:09:00,680,Nice doc...Hard to beat that for a quick evening fish.... The rapids wasnt as kind but we did manage some fish bouncing spawn  TDunn
