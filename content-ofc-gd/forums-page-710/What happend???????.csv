446224,Stern Rules,2010-03-22 06:24:00,342,At least this site doesn't change 10 times a year like facebook. Consider us lucky.
446225,kgeary,2010-03-22 06:48:00,82,Nice Job
446249,Fish Farmer,2010-03-22 11:21:00,2234,"Sorry, I didn't know there was such a problem with the other board. Avatars section and the outside boarders need to be a little smaller. That's just my opinion, my wife don't listen to me either   I'm just on the outside looking in, keep up the good work boys"
446253,Fisherman,2010-03-22 11:52:00,7201,"I've tried every possible combination, no luck, is there a way to copy the screen,(show you what I'm seeing) and send it to you?"
446286,Kinger,2010-03-22 13:28:00,351,The changes are great and much appreciated!  I know how much work goes into this stuff.
446337,Tdel,2010-03-22 15:14:00,393," Fisherman,  When you can see your problem on your monitor click ""Print Scrn"" button on your keyboard.  Then open a program such as Paint. If you have Windows XP it is found in ""Start"" ""All Programs"" ""Accessories"" ""Paint"".  Once paint opens go to the top left of the Paint menu and click on ""Edit"" then select ""Paste"". This will give you a picture of your problem.  You can save it to your computer and send it to Rick or post it in a thread.  Tom"
446341,Lostchild,2010-03-22 15:24:00,153,  Is this what you are looking for????..... 
446345,jackal68,2010-03-22 15:35:00,68,"I am a memeber of a vintage snowmobile organization. Its forum like this one, was hit HARD by some kind of hacker. it was down for a long time until they could fix the site. So I say if tweeking is needed to stay ahead of these dough heads then im for it"
446348,muddler,2010-03-22 15:36:00,623,I Love this new setup!  muddler
446350,ch312,2010-03-22 15:38:00,1590,"im up for fighting hackers, but the new format is less than desirable."
446367,Mike Pike,2010-03-22 16:02:00,1332,"I quite like the new look myself!  And I'm good with the avatar size.  On the old site, the avatars were so small you couldn't even tell what you were looking at, and that was WITH my new glasses on!  lol"
446372,Fisherman,2010-03-22 16:05:00,7201,"I'm going to have to do that from the home puter, the work one doesn't allow screen print for whatever reason.  Work & home both run XP Pro."
446374,bigfish1965,2010-03-22 16:09:00,3382,I shrunk to boxes to 200px relative. Thats about as small as I can make them..they are 12.5% narrower than before.
446375,Dutchy,2010-03-22 16:11:00,416,Whats wrong with the size of the avatars? Seems fine to me....
446400,Mike Pike,2010-03-22 16:43:00,1332,Maybe the guys with a few extra pounds found the old avatars 'slimming.'
446445,BassAsin,2010-03-22 18:17:00,806,and the complaints are far too many.
446451,gdelongchamp,2010-03-22 18:27:00,199,Looks great. Keep up the excellent work all of you.
446460,douG,2010-03-22 18:51:00,2693,"Rick, Roy, thanks for considerable efforts to keep this thing alive.  Nice job as always."
446588,irishfield,2010-03-22 23:07:00,26272,Now we get adverts in the threads??
446591,Fisherman,2010-03-22 23:11:00,7201," Well whatever you did must have had an effect on the other items that were ""broken"". The add reply, report, multi quote and edit are in the right place and no longer split in pieces along the bottom of the page, thanks for all your efforts. We all owe you an ultra sized Timmy with a couple of tractor wheels."
446059,Fish Farmer,2010-03-21 23:29:00,2234,Bring back the OLD Board
446067,Fisherman,2010-03-21 23:52:00,7201,"Ya, beginning to wonder what I have to do, now the avatars take up 1/3 of the space inside each post on the left side."
446073,JohnF,2010-03-22 00:04:00,3494,If memory serves the powers that be told us there were reasons for the upgrade so unless we want a refund I guess we'd better get with the program.  JF
446074,bigfish1965,2010-03-22 00:05:00,3382,Every time we upgrade guys say the same thing...then everyone gets the hang of the new stuff and then wonders how they lived without them before. The old board was a spam bot attractor and a security risk. We have to keep up to stay ahead of the bad people.
446077,Paully,2010-03-22 00:12:00,712,The avatars are a tad big...
446079,lookinforwalleye,2010-03-22 00:18:00,4399,  Yes you have to try and stay a step ahead of the evil doer`s my laptop was trashed by the pricks last weekend!!
446080,Moosebunk,2010-03-22 00:18:00,3970,So far I think it's looking cool Rick.  Keep up the good work.
446081,Moosebunk,2010-03-22 00:19:00,3970,"Ohhh, but wait... where are the Blogs?  They enroute?  I'll look harder."
446082,bigfish1965,2010-03-22 00:20:00,3382,You can scale the avatars by holding down CTRL and using the scroll wheel on your mouse.
446086,BillM,2010-03-22 00:23:00,17367,"I like the look of the new board, sans the avatar size.."
446087,Fisherman,2010-03-22 00:25:00,7201," Ya, avatar shrinks and so does the whole font in the message, now I need binoculars to read the text."
446088,Paully,2010-03-22 00:26:00,712, Thats much better.. Thanks Rick
446089,bigfish1965,2010-03-22 00:28:00,3382," They are likely gone, but if you are looking I can help you out."
446091,Paully,2010-03-22 00:29:00,712, Or some thicker glasses
446092,bigfish1965,2010-03-22 00:29:00,3382, What is your resolution set at?
446095,BillM,2010-03-22 00:31:00,17367,"Rick, is there a setting I can change so it loads this 'board resolution' every time?  It's a lot better without the monster avatars"
446097,TJQ,2010-03-22 00:32:00,7806,I think were looking at how to reduce the size of the avatar section.. theres gonna be some tweaking involved..
446100,bigfish1965,2010-03-22 00:35:00,3382," Your browser should remember the last settings. Mine does. If not, clear your OFC cookies and give it a go again."
446102,BillM,2010-03-22 00:37:00,17367,"Rockin, thanks bud!"
446105,Whitespinnerbait,2010-03-22 00:43:00,2038,Upgrade is alright by me..
446106,Fisherman,2010-03-22 00:43:00,7201,"1024 x 768, I've tried a couple of others along wit cooky delete, no change"
446110,bassjnkie,2010-03-22 00:51:00,1101,"I have to say good job, I like it. It is also easier to navigate with my phone, which is a bonus."
446112,bigfish1965,2010-03-22 00:51:00,3382,There are at least 15 sizes possible with your resolution. Try and find one that is a happy medium until we get a chance to recode the skin a bit.
446165,Moosebunk,2010-03-22 02:33:00,3970, That'd be ashame.  Ahh well.  If it's something you can dig up Rick I'd take all the links I had posted in mine... in a pm.  That way I can begin looking for a new home to house the easy access to the old reports.
446171,skeeter,2010-03-22 02:50:00,1907,if the avatars were smaller you wouldnt be able to see my pretty face as good......  love the new look its like painting the whole house after 5 years with the same color..... looks great..
