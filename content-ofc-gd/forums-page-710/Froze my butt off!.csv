446639,danbouck,2010-03-23 00:15:00,4380,With the kiddies screaming at home tonight I decided to take them out to the park and go fishing. It was damn cold out there and the fish were making me angry. I lost 4 because the hook just wouldn't stick and it WAS sharp (I know because it stuck into my finger).The 2nd one was HUGE but we all know that I could never land a decent size one    As I was just about ready to go I got another tug and finally landed my first carp of 2010. It was just a small one but anything will do right now.    It's funny I went out ice fishing twice and was in a t-shirt and now I'm hitting the soft water and it's freezing.  Hopefully I start adding a couple reports a week from now on.
446657,mbosh1980,2010-03-23 00:28:00,349,nice to see the carp are biting. Might have to get out there this week.
446678,Victor,2010-03-23 00:49:00,1609,nice to see some early season carp!  how did you lose those fish? was it on the hookset or mid-fight?
446682,danbouck,2010-03-23 00:53:00,4380, It was on the hook set.
446691,tibbs,2010-03-23 01:03:00,650,Looks like it was worth going out in the cold in the end! I've got to go out and try fishing for carp one of these days.
446693,danbouck,2010-03-23 01:05:00,4380, I got hooked on it last year. They put up an amazing fight and the bait and tackle is cheap.
446704,raptorfan,2010-03-23 01:10:00,126,"I remember at the ponds when I was a kid in Waterford, there was a mulberry tree on the walkway between 2 ponds.  This thing would ripen up around the first week of july, and drop berries into the pond for about 3 - 4 weeks.  We would be bassing the pads just down from there and hear these occuring splashes.  One day we walked down to have a look, and sure enough the carp were coming up to grab them.  We decided to hook some on our lines and shake the tree.  I have never seen such a feeding frenzy, and the fight was phenomenal!  Unfortunately, when they did the major construction on main st. bridge in town, they used this walkway as a main road, and cut down the tree to do so.  Those were fun days.  Nice fish Dan, way to brave the elements.......I was too afraid to go out and fish in this wind and rain, so I played Payday with the kids.....lol  Shawn"
446715,Victor,2010-03-23 01:19:00,1609, Do you use a hair rig Dan?
446721,danbouck,2010-03-23 01:25:00,4380," yep, but for tonight I quickly tied one with fluoro and it wasn't the best. I'm pretty sure that was my problem."
446728,solopaddler,2010-03-23 01:32:00,8605,Yech carp!
446732,backbay,2010-03-23 01:34:00,773,You're quite photogenic. Who is the carp holding you?
446781,hammercarp,2010-03-23 02:33:00,964,"Congradulations on your first of the year. I hope many more are to come. Try lightening up your rig. Use a little lighter mono for your hook link, a lighter bait and even a lighter wire hook."
446785,Victor,2010-03-23 02:35:00,1609,is there a chance that you're driving the hook too hard on the hookset and rips it out of their mouth? It happens sometimes ... I usually don't really set the hook if I know that my hook is sharp.
446792,BillM,2010-03-23 02:42:00,17367,I caught one of those badboys this weekend fishing for steelhead
446858,Marko,2010-03-23 07:33:00,854,"Nice fish, Maybe instead of fishing for rainbows i`ll go carp fishing. Carp I can actually catch."
446872,danbouck,2010-03-23 11:01:00,4380,"I don't set the hook hard, I usually just give it a little tug and it's good. I was using heavier line for my rig and it was too big. I will be making some new ones tonight with some thinner mono."
446874,Roy,2010-03-23 11:10:00,13728,Mighta been cold but you did good Dan.
446933,Leecher,2010-03-23 14:36:00,7832,"I'm sure you did not mind it at all after landing that brute Congrats on the first Dan ""insert clapping emotion here"" Leechman"
446953,Victor,2010-03-23 15:19:00,1609," I see. Good luck next time you head out and let us know how you do!  Thanks for the fish porn, keeps me sane"
