447200,trevy727,2010-03-23 22:05:00,351,I'm thinking about picking up a 12' sportspal. Does anyone have any answers for me? Are they stabile? Can 2 people ride in one? Would this be a good canoe for a trip into the Algonquin interior? I have a canoe now but I would really like a lighter one. Thanks in advance for any info from anyone.

A 12' Sportspal is potentially the worst possible craft for a canoe trip in the interior.  Beyond the fact that it paddles like a garbage scow it's simply not big enough for 2 guys plus gear.  In my opinion for canoe tripping with 2 adults a 16' canoe is an absolute minimum. Personally I prefer a 17' as it affords much more capacity and is generally more stable if you're talking 2 large guys.  I understand your desire for a lighter canoe. Unfortunately your best bet will be a used kevlar of some kind and that's still a bit of coin. It's an investment though as it'll last a lifetime potentially.  If kevlar isn't in your budget at the moment the next best thing imo would be a 17' lightweight Grumman aluminum.  They're actually quite light and are very sturdy.  Even today the old Grumman aluminums service many summer camps, outfitters and lodges in the north."
447248,fishindude,2010-03-23 23:02:00,220,This is a question for Solopaddler: Don't mean to go off topic but do you have an approximate weight estimation on the 16'/17' Grumman Aluminums?  Thanks
447260,trevy727,2010-03-23 23:14:00,351,Thanks a lot everyone. That's all I needed to know. I will not be buying one.
447263,solopaddler,2010-03-23 23:18:00,8605, 15' Lightweight Grumman is 55lb's  17' Lightweight Grumman is 60lb's  Bear in mind there is a vast difference in weight between the lightweight Grummans and the standard Grummans.
