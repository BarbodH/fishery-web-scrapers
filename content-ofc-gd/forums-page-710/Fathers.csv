446189,wjw,2010-03-22 03:29:00,35,"Flex, Sorry for your loss but how great it is to have the memories of the past. I had great parents and that eased the pain when they left this earth.  I was at the local retail giant yesterday and passed a small boy and his dad heading to the checkout with a new bike. The boy's face was full of excitement it was obvious that they were having a special moment.  Not more than a minute later I noticed two small boy's and a father (I assume) walking towards me. All three of them had fishing rods. My immediate thought was it is great to see this father/sons bonding. However, that thought was short lived as the father turned to the smallest of the two boys (5 years old?) and barked, ""if that rod tip hits my arm one more time I'm going to stick it so far up your A## you will be lucky to find it"".  I felt terrible for the boy. I thought once again how lucky I was to have loving parents. Enjoy your memories Flex and fathers love your kids."

Splashhopper  Lord, make me an instrument of your peace; where there is hatred, let me sow love; where there is injury, pardon: where there is doubt, faith ; where there is despair, hope where there is darkness, light where there is sadness, joy O divine Master, grant that I may not so much seek to be consoled as to console; to be understood, as to understand; to be loved, as to love; for it is in giving that we receive, it is in pardoning that we are pardoned, and it is in dying that we are born to Eternal Life.

445355,FLEX ROD,2010-03-19 11:28:00,394,"Well today I am berring my father, my best friend and the one that taught me what loving nature was all about.  This is the guy that passed on his love of fishing to me from as far back as I can remember, I have memories of him taking me out fishing for over 45 years.  No one was a better man, friend, father or husband, at his visitation yesterday, some of his hunting buddies came to me and even asked me for a peice of his hunting clothes just so that they would new forget him and he would be close to them when they would be out enjoying a mutual love.  Fathers  -   give your sons a big hug and or call them  Sons  -- do the same as time seems to go by so so fast and you never know.  We are very fortunate that this was sudden, he was not feeling well on Friday and we lost him on Monday night, but as I have been saying, we did not loose him he has just gone to a new fishing / hunting spot and is started to scout it out for all of us so that when we meet up he will be taking us to the hunny holes right off the bat.  Tight lines DAD"
