I was at our local farmers market this weekend and there was a guy there selling them 4 for $10 brand new in the package he had all different styles.I picked up a couple frogs and bass cranks,They look good the hooks and split rings are a little weak so I changed them out.Some pretty neat patterns available."
446636,mistaredone,2010-03-23 00:13:00,913,Im an avid muskie fisherman and ended getting a bunch of these lures as a gift last season.  The smaller lures are pretty good quality and worked great for bass.  The 7 1/2 inch crankbaits seem a little lacking.  Not for me.  The price looks right.  here's a link  http://gcttackle.110mb.com/main-en.html

Thanks to mistaredone, I've emailed them finding out whom their vendors are and where I can locate MORE of their tackle - Once I get a response, hopefully I can still find this post - and will reply with an update."
447202,FISHINGNUT,2010-03-23 22:06:00,253,Thanks for the reply  mistaredone .I guess I will have to buy a hand full or 2 for bass at 4 for $10 I guess I cant go wrong and if I dont like them I can always give them to the kids
447289,johndox,2010-03-24 00:00:00,54,Last summer I was out yard saleing looking for cheap fishing stuff and ran into this guy selling these lures out of his driveway in Caledonia. I bought a bunch for the same price as you paid I think plus he had a good deal on rubber nets so I bought one of those too. He was also selling some waders and other stuff as well. Ive got his card with his name and number if you are interested.
