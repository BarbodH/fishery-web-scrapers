447282,MJL,2010-03-23 23:47:00,2427, I've wrapped small chunks of frozen ones to my Kwikfish with moderate success - Works better with medium sized or bigger lures.  Saw guys on a TV show wrapping sardines around one and thought I'd try it with shrimp we were going to have for dinner instead.  Don't leave them in your wading jacket for a week unrefrigerated like I did...It wasn't pretty
447348,fish_fishburn,2010-03-24 01:00:00,1311,Thanks MJL but I was thinking along the lines of drifting them under a float or maybe on bottom with a small split shot.I'm just not sure how you would rig them or if they would have to be preped first.
447370,rbaquial,2010-03-24 01:31:00,968,"I would assume a ""Ledger Rig"" (I think the folks in England call 'em)... would be best, with some type of float to get it a few feet higher off the ground?"
447404,NAC,2010-03-24 02:21:00,369,Used to wrap em in pink mesh just like tying roe and put a corkie infront of them for bottom bouncing the Niagara. Smaller raw shrimp.
