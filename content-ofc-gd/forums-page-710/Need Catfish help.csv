447349,johndox,2010-03-24 01:01:00,54,"Looking for some info on fishing for Catfish on the Grand river. Have never fished them before and from what I see on here I think I would like to go and try my luck. Need to know what kind of tackle and bait to use.  I have a boat or is it just as well to fish them off shore. I think from what I am reading this is the right time of year to fish them. I am an experienced fisherman I have just never fished for big cats before so any help would be greatly appreciated. I live in Cayuga and the river is outside my front door, can you fish for them here or are all the big ones below the dam in Dunnville."
447383,Dozer,2010-03-24 01:57:00,896,"Fishmasters marina in Dunnville.  Thats where we go, we wentin a boat once and once from shore, had luck in early AM and right at sundown...  Use big rods with stinky baits... choppedup suckers is what we used.  Big sinkers... just drop the line and BANG!  Take your boat if you can."
447388,landry,2010-03-24 02:05:00,1005,"Go to fishmasters in dunnville and buy the cutbait, weights, swivels and hooks there!!!!!! Launch at his place and follow the boats (respectfully). It is pretty easy. A flippn stick and 30 - 50 lb braid will do (or 20 lb mono). Attach a lighter leader. Use 2 anchors if you have them - and bottom fish. It is FUN!!! Good luck! Landry"
447399,uglyfish,2010-03-24 02:17:00,981,"use a heavy rod and reel with a big line capacity. i use my muskie gear. 50lb braid, 1-3oz slip sinker, depending on current. good quality swivel, 12-18inch 20-25lb mono or flouro leader. 5/0 circle hook. buy a bag of cutbait from fishmasters bait and tackle. and go fish, dont leave ur rod or u'll be buying a new one! lol  shore or boat is fine, talk to steve at the store, he'll point u in the rite direction.  but thats the setup to use!"
447403,bigugli,2010-03-24 02:20:00,6138,"Anywhere from Cayuga on down is loaded with cats.  Heck you just have to go to the small park below the Hwy3 bridge in Cayuga and fire out a bottom rig with 1oz or more of weight. A 1/0 or 2/0  bait hooked dressed with sucker meat, shad, smelt,.  Fire that into one of the pockets between the pilings.  Have to admit there is a big concentration of cats in the stretch tween Fishmasters and the Dunnville dam."
447466,Sugarpacket,2010-03-24 04:53:00,82,"I hate to say it but you should get a hold of Rich hes got to be the catfish god but I found the best bait we used besides cut up suckers was really old stinky cut up beef, I'm talking stinky like verge of killing your noes stinky rotting. For tackle using a heavier test with a long rod and heavy reel (bait runners are good if you got one) an egg sinker and swivel with a circle hook. For time of day we always had our best luck at dusk till the wee hours of morning. I've only fished for them in Dunnville a hand full of times and caught more sheepheads than cats but i think that was just my bad luck since I have seen others come out with some rather large kitties. anyways thats all the tips i can give you good luck and be sure to post your results! I'm stuck out here in NS which is a cat free zone so I would love to see how you guys do this year! GOOD LUCK"
447467,Stern Rules,2010-03-24 05:02:00,342,"I've heard it's a good time to start now too but never have gotten out this early. I've caught them in the middle of summer no problem. I fish from shore. I have 50 lb braid on my reel with a 1 oz. egg sinker and a swivel. I still use the braid as a leader and catch them no problem. I used a 3/0 hook, can't remember the type, and cut suckers. Works great. Biggest I've caught was 6 lbs. Dunnville seems to be the place for big ones. I must get out there this year. I think Fishmaster sells his stinkbait. Try that but cutbait still works."
