I do most of my fishing on one lake but I do venture off to others once in a while and hope to do more or that in the future.  I fish mostly bass / Pike / lake trout. I have been looking at HDS 5 but with everything I need it would be at least 1000.00 which is more than I want to spend.  I have been to BPS and I find they are not much help.  What I think I want is color screen / GPS and a 5 inch screen.  What I want to spend in around $500.00, any suggestions or should I hold off anther year until the HDS 5 comes down in price."
