369864,Terry,2009-08-05 17:12:00,14456,"it was real windy but I went for a run and drove over a big school of fish and wondered, hmmmm. what could they be  stopped the boat dropped the anchor and the camera....ahhhh perch and lots of them I am getting better at recording them, I think you will like this one a few minutes from the 3 hours of recordings      how the heck am I going to find the time to fish with all this fun happening around me  hope you liked it"
369866,rbaquial,2009-08-05 17:19:00,968,"Nice, how deep were they?"
369867,Terry,2009-08-05 17:20:00,14456,these ones were 15 ft but an hour later I stopped over 35 ft of water cause I saw fish on the finder and thought they might be crappie but put the camera down and another big school of perch
369869,TC1OZ,2009-08-05 17:25:00,987,Thats so awesome!
369874,Leecher,2009-08-05 17:31:00,7832,Awesome Terry    Love the tune also Keep up the good work!!! Leechman
369895,blaque,2009-08-05 18:12:00,2419,"like i said, id never get any fishing done"
369916,splashhopper,2009-08-05 19:08:00,2931,very kewl... i had no idea the perch could get that big....  great tune too
369919,Dozer,2009-08-05 19:15:00,896,"hmmm... 1:38, top right corner..."
369920,Terry,2009-08-05 19:18:00,14456,"it's hard to tell how big things are  without something to compare it to.  but the anchor was  25 or more feet away from the camera, so I had a pretty good field of vision"
369921,Dozer,2009-08-05 19:19:00,896,"Oh, and great video, I love stuff like this... keep 'em comin'!"
369925,misfish,2009-08-05 19:30:00,29133,  Seen that too.Look like a a fat smallie.
369929,Sinker,2009-08-05 19:37:00,8692,Pretty cool Terry. How is the visibility in the kawartha lakes? Have you tried it? I know there are times when I have a good school of eyes right under my boat........it would be cool to see what the heck they're doing down there!!!  S.
369941,Terry,2009-08-05 19:59:00,14456,"I am not sure how far you could see on  the kawarthas, because most of it isn't too deep I would think you would have some visibility, when I get a change I will try over there with the camera"

369971,Joey,2009-08-05 21:18:00,9122,"That's pretty neat Terry.  The camera is pretty clear, especially when it shows the anchor chain.  Cool  Joey"
369975,rock34,2009-08-05 21:30:00,215,What is the name of that song and the artist??  Its awesome!
369986,007,2009-08-05 22:16:00,537,That's awesome.  You gotta love movies of stripeys. I certainly wouldn't do much fishing if I had one of those cameras.  Looks like real fun. Thanks for sharing. 007
