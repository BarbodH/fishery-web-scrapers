369649,Kinger,2009-08-05 02:38:00,351,"My buddy caught this big sucker out of Lake George around ice out.  Anyone know what kind of fish it is, as far as I know white suckers don't grow anywhere near that big so is it a hybrid or something?  Thanks in advance.    "

369652,Kinger,2009-08-05 02:40:00,351,"that was my guess, thank you."
369653,gino,2009-08-05 02:42:00,400,"that looks like a sucker, but it might be mixed with carp...sounds a little scarry...a new species???"
369654,Dara,2009-08-05 02:43:00,3052,Didja eat it?
369664,Kinger,2009-08-05 02:58:00,351,"Lol, absolutely NOT!"
369668,Greencoachdog,2009-08-05 03:08:00,8163," YOP!!!... da Newfie knows hiz suckers eh!!!  Lookit the Dorsal, pectoral, and pelvic fins for a hint eh!!!  ... do I gotta do all the thinkin' around here???"
369695,Jonny,2009-08-05 04:21:00,1380,"Specifically it's probably a River Redhorse or a Greater Redhorse.  The redhorses are good to eat, but very bony.  The meat from commercially-caught redhorses has sometimes been marketed as ""mullet""."
369732,Mike Pike,2009-08-05 12:54:00,1332,"With that broad body and what appears to be a red tinge on the lower and tail fins, I'd echo the guys who said Redhorse Sucker too.  Down here there is a River Redhorse that resides in the lower Grand River."
369739,marth11,2009-08-05 13:10:00,60,thats a redhorse allright a biggun to looks well over 5lbs they are quite fun to catch not as fun as carp though but 50 thousand times more tastier

369764,Roy,2009-08-05 14:00:00,13728,Redhorse. That particular one is called Fred. Benson's second cousin.
369768,bluesky1713,2009-08-05 14:06:00,107,"River Redhorse.  Caught a bunch of those this spring over 10lbs.  Interestingly, it is a species of special concern in Ontario: http://www.dfo-mpo.gc.ca/species-especes/s...riviere-eng.htm"

369800,michaelkovacs,2009-08-05 14:56:00,48,"  I thought mullets were only found in the Peterborough area, and isolated parts of Hamilton??? hahahahahaah... jk, born and raised in the hammer."
