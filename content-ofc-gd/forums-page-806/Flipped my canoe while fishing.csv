370073,tjsa,2009-08-06 01:42:00,1578," Yup, been there, done that, but in hunting season. Packing up the decoys to paddle back to the launch, saw a flight coming in at us head on. We hunkered down in the canoe. They flared, then broke right!!!!!!  We are both right handed, so I went lefty, and dropped a mallard within 10 yds. of us.  OK, get the decoys in and try to retrieve the mallard...................another flock coming in at us head on...............again, they break right(to us)shoot lefty again, but so does my bud in the front of the canoe, and.....................glub...glub......glub..................AHHHHHH, so nice to have chest waders full of water in late September. Thankfully we held onto our shotguns, ..........we flipped the canoe back over, dispelling most of the water, I climbed back in over the aft end, my bud crawled back in over the front end, both of us taking time to put our legs up to empty the water out of our waders(this was way back when we we were young and stupid). Got the decoys loaded, retrieved the mallard I downed(no idea if we hit any of the next flight) and paddled our way out for 2 kms.  Got to say, 2 guys with no upper clothes on, coming back into town, in an old Dodge Ram Power Wagon, circa 1966, in 1980, we did get a lot of attention when there was street lighting, as it was probably only 5C at the time,   :lol:  :lol:  Two weeks later, we recovered most of the rest of our gear, which was only in 4 ft. of water, but in the loon crap bottom. A big treble hook comes in quite handy at times. The shotgun shells survived amazingly, but my binoculars were toast though.  The very next weekend, friends of ours did the darned EXACT same thing as us, in a slightly different area, but could not recover from it, but they were spotted by some American walleye/perch fishermen who came to their aid.  They were lucky that weekend."
370085,Greencoachdog,2009-08-06 01:58:00,8163,"  I learned to to do it sailing a Sunfish with my 2 younger brothers and our Border Collie ""Pal""!  ... never could flip or sink a Boston whaler, but we only had 9.9's on them...   Flipped a canoe in N.C. in January, there aint no ice there... but damn that water was COLD!!!  I'm a stinkin' ol' fart now and wear my PFD 90% of the time now... figured I lived this long, may as well live a little longer...   plus my postings here really irritate the crap out of some folks, and that's what I REALLY live for!!!"
370087,Black_Blade,2009-08-06 01:59:00,258," I was planning on replying to this thread, to say that was the main reason i have a Sportspal...even if they get capsized they remain upright and your gear stays inside the canoe.  I've never heard of one tipping before...a friend of mine fought a big pike one time in my dad's 12' Sportspal and at one time the canoe was almost on a 45 degree angle, with stuff sliding all over the place...but she never went any further than that.  A few years ago, while at Bass Lake PP, I rescued a man and his daughter after their canoe had capsized on them.  Both of them climbed into my 14 ' square stern model from the middle of the canoe with no problems...and I had a bunch of my fishing gear, gas tank etc in there as well.  After recovering all the floating debris, we managed to bail enough water out of his canoe to allow me to tow it back to the dock...which was all my little 3 HP could do...lol.  The guy was shocked that he had been able to climb into my canoe from the side, for he was a pretty big guy.  They may not paddle as well as a regular type canoe, but they are true to their name and when it comes to fishing or hunting...they are hard to beat.  Glad everybody was alright in this case here...especially after hearing in the news of all the drownings going on lately."
370090,Dara,2009-08-06 02:04:00,3052,"Many moons ago there were 3 us us fishing specs from a canoe I hooked one and the large inexperienced American fellow in the middle sitting on the bottom grabs the net. When the fish got close, he lunges at it with the net. Water comes in over the side, but the other 2 of us lean back in time to avert disaster. We did take on about 4 inches of water though. After the fish was landed our American friend requests that we go to shore to empty the canoe so that he doesn't have to sit in water all day. Well, us 2 with the seats under us decided that it would be a good reminder to not lunge for fish if he was required to sit in the aftermath for a while  ...And man did we catch specs that trip"
370096,Greencoachdog,2009-08-06 02:10:00,8163,  Damned Americans!!!
370103,Dara,2009-08-06 02:19:00,3052,"  He was from Ohio, and lots of fun to tease....but we took him on some amazing fishing trips. Better than any flyin lake you ever saw"

370143,scuro2,2009-08-06 04:44:00,904, I remember that story well.
370167,Fish4Eyes,2009-08-06 11:54:00,1022,I went into a canoe once and never again. Worst and most uncomfortable experience ever.
369790,hoot33,2009-08-05 14:44:00,93,"So I was fishing two days ago with a friend of mine, the water in the river was peaceful with a slow current, he decided to change a lure and made one wrong move. With a full OPEN tackle box and three rods we went tumbling into the river. I swam over frantically and closed my tackle box before swimming the flooded canoe to shore.  After figuring out my cell phone and digital camera were now toast we paddled back to camp to change and have some hot coffee.  The following is a picture of my tackle box when we got back to shore.    And the worst part is we didnt even get a bite."
369792,ciceri,2009-08-05 14:47:00,535,"you can save your cell phone if you don't try turning it on, just let it sit and dry for a couple days. Worked for me when I took the plunge in March.  we've tipped the canoe before too, no good."
369795,evster,2009-08-05 14:51:00,367,"One time when I was young my dad and I were fishing from a canoe.  He snagged an underwater branch, when we got over to it we both took a peak to see how bad the snag was, next thing you know we were in the water.  It happens so fast.  Lickily we had out tackle boxes closed and tied to the canoe and neither of us dropped our rods, but I could see it becoming a very costly experience.  You'll look back and laugh, but it sure aint fun at the time!"
369797,TC1OZ,2009-08-05 14:52:00,987,"He is 100% correct. All electrical items are allowed to get wet, its just when there is active power the water can cause traces to cross/connect to places they shouldn't, thus frying something.  Let it sit for at least 48 hours, and if possible set it in a pile of rice when drying!!"

369808,addy79,2009-08-05 15:20:00,573,"dang!  the worst feeling is when the canoe hangs on a 180 before going right over! all you can do is look for the valuable stuff and hold on tight! lol  oddly enough, most guys drown from the canoe when they flip and the canoe bonks them on the head on the way down...  could've been worse!"

369962,wask,2009-08-05 20:41:00,174,I flipped one last week with all of my gear in it.  Shallow water thankfully but still a pain.  I celebrated by buying an aluminum boat this week.  I'm done with the canoe. 
369968,Burning Babies,2009-08-05 21:02:00,150,"I tipped a canoe once while fighting a bass.  I basically realized what was happening and rolled out before it flipped completely, leaving all the tackle safely inside.  Caught the bass treading water.  I'd suggest to anyone to keep their cell phone and camera in Ziploc bags when on the water."

370040,Canuck2fan,2009-08-06 00:52:00,1444,"Welcome and I feel your pain, I was fishing with a brand new rod in July on a pier and a sheephead grabbed it and almost took it, if the butt had not of bounced so the rod handle when up when it hit the corroded part of the pier it would have been gone. It wasn't even a day old.  So I thought to myself, ummmm self, you should use the old rod next time. I did and after fishing for about 30 minutes a wave washed over the end and took that rod over the edge.... The look on everyone's face when I ran my rather large out of shape butt about 25 feet swooped down and grabbed it from mid air was priceless. So stuff happens fast when you are fishing even on shore.  Also, because of your post EVERYONE got another lesson on what to do with wet electronics!!! So you have done the board a service on your first post."
370041,bigugli,2009-08-06 00:54:00,6138,"The navy did the same thing to us when we did our small craft training.  Got us out in the lifeboat and then flipped 'er up.  Your mission, right the boat and bring her dockside. A whaler is no small boat."

You can go places with a canoe or kayak you can't get with anything else, Glad everyone was OK, Life jackets are a good idea Richard"
