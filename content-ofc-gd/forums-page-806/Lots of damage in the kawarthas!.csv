369898,Beans,2009-08-05 18:14:00,3339, Your boat should be OK...I talked with a lady outside the variety store after I left Cliff's and she said other than a few small branches and the hydro out for four hours...no damages at Lunge Haven
369906,Beans,2009-08-05 18:29:00,3339,"Cliff would have been happy to see this...just before 10:00am today    By 10:00 am reinforcements arrived    The uprooted tree    Just up the road...somebody's roof or shed on top of the snapped-off pole    I guess if one goes...the others follow suit    I'll let Cliff post the pics of the damages...not pretty  I drove by at 12:30 pm and the hydro crews were hard at it...no place to stop for pics but I did manage to ask one hydro guy about when service would be back up...""sometime this afternoon"" he sez"
369933,Sinker,2009-08-05 19:41:00,8692,"Wow.......crazy stuff Beans! How did the marina make out? By the looks of things, that metal might be from thier covered slips! I'm glad my boat isn't there this year!!  S."
369935,Dozer,2009-08-05 19:44:00,896,"Wow, theres been some scary weather in the last few years..."
370028,Beans,2009-08-06 00:09:00,3339, Couldn't see much from the road where I took the pictures...this pile of rubble was across the road from the pile on the pole...    Another shot of the pile on the snapped-off pole    You could be right..part of the roof of the marina...
370030,Joey,2009-08-06 00:16:00,9122,"Wow Cliff, I'm so glad you are okay.  Those pictures look like it was a heckuva storm.  Be safe and let us know if you need any help.  Joey"
370155,Big Cliff,2009-08-06 10:52:00,6899,"Thanks gang, all is good, hydro came back on just as I pulled in the drive way from work. Talked to my insurance company, they said ""No Problem"" anything over your deductable, we'll cover. Deductable is $1000.00 so I guess I'm going to be out of pocket for that much but........  Last night a local young lad had come by and said if he could have the wood he he would clean up all but the brush which the city will do. By dark he had two truck loads gone and said he would be back to finish it by tonight. Now I have to get a carpenter in to see about fixing the roof, shouldn't be too big a job. Neighbour on one side of me does fences for a living, neighbour on the other side does siding and eves troughing.  MY boss at work gave me a fantastic deal on a 6500W generator which will be plenty to run my whole house if we ever have another power failure and an Electrican friend said he will hook everything up for the cost of materials (about $300.00) we'll never be caught without power again. My little 1000W portable did a fantastic job but just wasn't big enough to run my water pump and fridges.  When life hands you a bowl full of lemons.....make lemonaid."
370161,ketchenany,2009-08-06 11:36:00,3229,Glad everything is ok! slowly but surely things will come back as they were. How may lemons did you get?
370198,perodimi,2009-08-06 13:07:00,124,"Beans,  Thanks so much for the information, that's a relief! I'm back in town now so I can go check things out for myself.  Cheers,  Peter"
370261,ciceri,2009-08-06 16:41:00,535,"I'm in Lindsay as well, and there were alot of trees down, almost every block. Down town had some flooded areas and my mom got stuck down there. There had to be 2 feet of water in some spots, the Trans Am was floating!"
370380,dada2727,2009-08-07 00:04:00,108,"I think everybody is pretty much back up now except maybe some remote areas.  I work out of fenelon falls hydro and it's been a long last couple of days let me tell ya.  Sturgeon lake took most of the damage, Long beach, snug harbour, pleasent point, thurstonia were among the worst.  Just a wicked downburst apparently, wind speeds up to 100km/h.  Anyways, be nice to those hydro workers out there, most of us are working minimum 16 hour days when these storms hit."
369604,Big Cliff,2009-08-05 01:19:00,6899,"My place is a mess, a huge tree came down and damaged my garage, fence, and took out a couple of hydro poles. We don't have any power so no running water but we have bottled water for drinking, have filled up the tub for flushing toilets, and have oir little generator to run our computer, TV, and a few Lights. We are OK and that is all that matters!  I pray everyone else made out as well as we have!  If you had a boat at the Mourings Marina, you mught want to check on it, they had a lot of damage."
369606,motv8tr,2009-08-05 01:24:00,2587,"Dang Cliff, I'm sorry to hear that, but very happy to know you and Sue are allright.  If you need anything let me know and I'll do what I can.  Maureen"
369613,Nanook,2009-08-05 01:33:00,565,"Gee! thats tough Cliff. We got the high winds and HEAVY rain, but no damage here. Glad you are both OK. Let me know if we can help out in any way. Jack and Jackie"
369615,bigugli,2009-08-05 01:42:00,6138,Sorry to hear you got walloped. Hope the damage was not too extensive.
369621,Leecher,2009-08-05 02:01:00,7832,Glad you guys are OK Cliff.... Up here we got some heavy winds and rain but nothing like the weather channel forecasted. Leechman
369622,Skud,2009-08-05 02:04:00,739,Nothing in Barrie. A few dark clouds and a bit of wind. Sorry to hear you got banged up.
369623,John,2009-08-05 02:04:00,2956,Glad you guys are OK. Hope you get power back soon.....
369638,Garry2Rs,2009-08-05 02:20:00,1425,Glad to hear you are okay. The Hydro guys were here a couple of weeks ago and took down a lot of dead and weak branches.  I guess they did a good job because the lights didn't even flicker around Apsley.
369645,spinnerbaitking,2009-08-05 02:37:00,1622,Glad to hear every one is OK hopefully Mother Hydro can get you going soon Richard
369650,Sinker,2009-08-05 02:39:00,8692,"Hey Cliff, I""m off the next two days if you need a hand. I'm pretty handy with a chainsaw, and don't mind a bit of hard work. As long as my son can fish off your dock, we can come up anytime wed or thurs.  Shoot me a pm if you need anything.  S."
369657,camillj,2009-08-05 02:45:00,1988,"Sorry to hear Cliff, Glad everyone is alright ... everything else can be repaired"
369662,perodimi,2009-08-05 02:56:00,124,"Hi Cliff,  I'm back from Hong Kong Wednesday night and would be happy to come up first thing Thursday morning and give you a hand. Even if you're at work I can give Sue a hand as well. I've got two generators I can bring up as well, a 4000 watt and a little 1000 watt that can at least run a fridge.  I hope my boat at Lunge Haven made it through!  I'll give you a call Wednesday when I get back.  Cheers,  Peter"
369675,Rattletrap2,2009-08-05 03:32:00,1652,Sorry to hear of your property damages there Cliff. Glad to hear that you are both ok.  Did this blow through tonight?
369694,HTHM,2009-08-05 04:19:00,4082,"Have chainsaw, will travel."
369701,Spiel,2009-08-05 10:14:00,9065, Exactly! Glad you're both Ok.
369702,Big Cliff,2009-08-05 10:42:00,6899,"Thank you all for the PM's and phone calls with offers to help. I am posting here because I have to leave for work and don't have time to answer them all via PM.  So far we are doing fine, our little generator has kept us in lights and enough power to run the computer and TV, we have lots of bottled water for drinking and a lake full of water for flushing etc..  I haven'tt seen the Hydro crews yet, I can't do much about the tree that is down until they come, it is leaning across the wires and has already broken two poles, I think I'll let them deal with it and I'll just clean up what ever they leave behind.  Hopfully we'll have hydro back on by tonight but if not, I'll be bringing a bigger generator home from work so that I can run my freezers and such.  Thanks again everyone, I'll keep you posted and hopfully have some pictures by this evening. Oh and Sinker, your sone can come fish off my dock anytime anyway. in the last two weeks the kids have caught a (approx) 14lb muskie, a 4 lb LM and about a 12"" crappie (amoung other things)."
369706,F_ast,2009-08-05 11:28:00,154,Any word on how far this storm traveled?  My parents left the cottage yesterday morning... Hope everything is alright there.
369711,Roy,2009-08-05 11:40:00,13728,"Hope you and Sue are ok, Cliff. I know that the good folks of the board will never let you down should you need anything. We got hit last night around 10. It lasted no more than 2 hours but it didn't cause any damage from what I could see this morning. A few branches scattered around the roads is all.  Hope hydro cleans it up quickly for you."
369713,cranks bait,2009-08-05 11:54:00,721,"We had something come through last night around seven.  Lasted about ten minutes.  Wind was strong enough to knock over a 36 foot sail boat right infront of my house.  Just out for a race night and out of nowhere they had capsized the boat.  Another pontoon with a full canopy was going with the wind.  I would guess he was doing about 50 mph, he was just boogying.  Glad to hear you are ok."
369717,Beans,2009-08-05 12:06:00,3339,Heading down to Lindsay for some lab work...will drop by on my way...  Cheers !!!...Mate
369751,ecmilley,2009-08-05 13:46:00,2163,"we got hammered as well cliff, there was 28 trees down mostly across the roads in thurstonia (and of course hydro wires) no damage to my property other than a loose mail box, but have heard it may be 10 pm tonight before full restoration"
369781,JohnF,2009-08-05 14:31:00,3494,"Another weird storm - well, mebbe not so weird for THIS summer. I was heading home under sunny skies to start the bbq and watched the rainclouds blow in. It was pouring within 5 minutes. My wife called her gf to cancel their golf game about 30 kliks away. We got a lot of rain in a short time, not much wind and no hail, then the sun was out again in short order and we had a beautiful evening. This morning Wendy called her gf who said she played and Wendy missed a great round, with clear skies, warm breeze and no rain (30 kliks away). KW is only 40 kliks away and they apparentlly had hail. Crazy stuff.  JF"
369875,fishnsled,2009-08-05 17:33:00,3520,Glad to hear that you and Sue are OK.  Some crazy weather in TO yesterday but I got nothing at home.  Not even a drop of rain.  I can certainly come up on the weekend if you need a hand with anything.  Just shoot me a PM.
