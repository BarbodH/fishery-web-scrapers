370009,misfish,2009-08-05 23:37:00,29133,  I dont like you already.LOL J/K  That shad fishing must be a blast. Welcome.
367945,PikeMolester,2009-07-30 10:04:00,428,"Hey guys, this is my first post from Montreal. Just joined community and looking forward to learning more. Your guys' anthem is sick LOL No scale unfortunately but here is a big smallmouth. I couldnt even believe I caught it where I did. (under some ghetto bridge in montreal with trains passing over every 15 minutes)  Biggest Largemouth of the day last week-end on Lake St-Francis Ont.  American Shad come spawn near this dam in Montreal and its a FRENZY. The current was violent. It jerked and threw the boat around so much that the anchor came loose numerous times. We even saw another boat capsize. In total we caught 51 Shad (all the size you see in the pics) and one tiny walleye in 5 hours. After looking at all your pics I realize I hold it like a real NOOB    And somehow I hooked this tiny ass walleye "
367946,snagmaster,2009-07-30 10:07:00,250,Nice fish man. Welcome to the board. Gotta love the anthem...Im the one with the walleye in it..ahaha
367948,Paully,2009-07-30 10:32:00,712,Great first post! What hydro-Electric dam is that? P.s - thats a tiny wally lol... not too often you can lip one.
367951,PikeMolester,2009-07-30 10:36:00,428,Thanks. Its Carillon Quebec hydro dam. You can google it and find its location. 
367952,Roy,2009-07-30 10:37:00,13728,"Welcome aboard. Nice to have another compatriot from far eastern Ontario aboard. Not that many people are equipped to safely handle that water during the shad run. Glad you did well this past season. And yes, our anthem, a massive undertaking by CCMT (Cliff) is a classic. I'm pictured in there a few times....the most realistic pic though is the Croc Dundee shot at the very end.  Again, welcome aboard."
367960,splashhopper,2009-07-30 11:56:00,2931,"welcome aboard, eh"
367964,Cudz,2009-07-30 12:16:00,2652,welcome.  Nice largie and those shad are huge and that eye it is tiny.

367972,blaque,2009-07-30 12:39:00,2419,"Welcome..............nice fish, and nice avatar (deftones)"

367988,MCTFisher9120,2009-07-30 13:36:00,3761,"Welcome man, Congrads on those nice bass...i tend to favor those among the other stupid species of fish  If you can catch bass you can fish!  Welcome aboard man! MTBF"
367996,Greencoachdog,2009-07-30 14:05:00,8163,"Nice report, pics, and fish... but...   Wouldn't have been a good idea to be wearing your PFD in those conditions?... especially with all those heavy clothes on eh?"
368000,backbay,2009-07-30 14:10:00,773,"Welcome, Canucker! I know the area a  little bit: Do you fish both above and below the dam?"
368029,highdrifter,2009-07-30 16:16:00,2534,"Noice juan!!  Kewl avatar too.  Minerva is a sick track.  My ""Happy"" music.  cheers HD"
368038,PikeMolester,2009-07-30 16:52:00,428,Went twice and both times below the dam.
368040,PikeMolester,2009-07-30 16:53:00,428,No idea what PFD stands for but I'm assuming you meant life jacket...we had them on board. Ya I prolly shoulda worn it.
368048,Greencoachdog,2009-07-30 17:22:00,8163,  PFD= personal flotation device= life jacket... they work a lot better if you're wearing it.  Did you keep those Shad to eat?
368055,PikeMolester,2009-07-30 17:43:00,428,Nah we were allowed to keep 6 per person...but we let all 51 shad go free and unharmed. This forum is starting to make me wanna learn how to clean/batter and fry fish tho
368146,PikeMolester,2009-07-30 21:46:00,428,All I catch is bass..its damn annoying. Time to target PIKE. I'm obsessed with trying to get my a beasty pike.
