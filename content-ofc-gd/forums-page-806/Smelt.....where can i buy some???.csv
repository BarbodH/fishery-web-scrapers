369802,Chugger,2009-08-05 15:04:00,109,"Anyone know where I can buy smelt in the GTA or anywhere along the drive from Toronto to Huntsville? Been a slow year fishing wise for me, I'd go so far as to say this has been  my worst year fishing to date....sad but true.  So no pictures worth putting up, apologies...."
369822,Woodsman,2009-08-05 15:50:00,1286,For dead bait?
369824,Chugger,2009-08-05 15:52:00,109,Yes sir.
369828,Woodsman,2009-08-05 15:58:00,1286,"Try Food Basics. They have frozen ocean smelt in the 6""-8"" in bags. Cheap bait. These are whole fish with heads and guts."
369830,Chugger,2009-08-05 16:01:00,109,"That sounds like they're al ittle bigger than I'm looking for, anyone else know where to get them? Thanks either way Woodsman..."
369840,rbaquial,2009-08-05 16:35:00,968,Some tackle shops carry Smelt that are preserved. I know Bass Pro Shops and LeBaron carry them... I'm betting some of those 'smaller' shops have them too.
369842,Chugger,2009-08-05 16:38:00,109,"Perfect, I'll ahve a look for them, thanks much.  I've seen the shinrs in the yellow pacakges at BPS, I assume they'll have smelt like that to then."
369844,rbaquial,2009-08-05 16:41:00,968,"Yeah, they do. Often it numerous sizes...  Although, I'm not too sure if its meant to be used ""right out of the package""... cause it has preservatives in it, so it doesn't smell natural. (to me at least) I've used them before in the past, never any success on it. I'm thinking there's some ""step"" that needs to be done, BEFORE its put on the hook. If anyone knows of how to 'correctly' use these preserved baits, I'd like to know... Thanks in advance!  Your welcome Chugger!"
369856,Chugger,2009-08-05 16:58:00,109,Perhaps drop them in a tub of gulp?
369858,rbaquial,2009-08-05 17:00:00,968,That sounds like an AWESOME idea!  Hahaha... Never thought of that!  Thanks bud!
369859,Woodsman,2009-08-05 17:04:00,1286," What are you fishing for that 6""-8"" baits will be too large?"
369861,Chugger,2009-08-05 17:08:00,109,Lake trout
369871,Woodsman,2009-08-05 17:28:00,1286,"6""-8"" is far from too large for lakers. Big fish don't get big by eating small snacks."
369872,Chugger,2009-08-05 17:29:00,109,"very true, I guess I was just thinking about the size of williams wobbler I'm using...going to give it a shot."
369887,Fang,2009-08-05 17:47:00,1330,"Discount grocery stores like Food Basics, No Frills and Price Chopper should carry  frozen bag of lake smelt. I've seen them at no frills just recently.  FWIW we use the 6-8"" frozen sticklebacks and sardines from the grocery store all winter for lakers up that way. Keeps the little guys off your line. When you do get a hit it's always a little bigger fish."
369893,Rich,2009-08-05 18:11:00,3927,"As far as I know, the seafood departments in every Loblaws store (Fortinos, No Frills, Zehrs, Superstore) carry bags of frozen smelt."
369979,tjsa,2009-08-05 21:48:00,1578,"Chugger, never, ever, guesstimate what size of bait a lake trout will hit.  Thats a 3"" Salmo Chubby Darter with a laker hanging from it,  "
