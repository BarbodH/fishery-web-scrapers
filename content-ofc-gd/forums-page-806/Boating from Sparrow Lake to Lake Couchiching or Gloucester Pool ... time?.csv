370034,ohhenrygsr,2009-08-06 00:26:00,947,you can ask the Lock attendants or a boater in the lock they would know best.  I'll ask my GF they been through the locks a bunch of times
370144,carp-starter,2009-08-06 04:48:00,253,"TIMES FOR THE 2 TRIPS  m-x or M-z is the mileage in miles at the point designated. These are shown on the Trent/Severn paper charts like #2028 and #2029.  SPARROW LAKE TO COUCH  Start is at marker S239 – m-214 – entrance to the Severn River.  Lock 42 is at m-210 (Couch Lock) – expect at least 30 to 45 minutes to get thru – all depends on many factors.  One time, Big Chute was going at the rate of 6 hours (GB to Lake Simcoe direction). Once, at Severn Lock it took me about 2-3 minutes to speed into the one spot left on the final lock trip down to GB direction. They had just started to close the lock gates. I arrived at the very last second on that day.  At m-208 – entrance to Lake Couch.  Total miles is 6 plus one lock. How long it will take will depend on you. The speed on the river is 6 or 10 mph max.  SPARROW LAKE TO GLOUCHESTER POOL  Start is at marker S239 – m-214 – entrance to the Severn River.  At m-224.5 is Swift Rapids Lock. Time to get thru – it depends.  At m-236, you can make a turn off the main channel and into the POOL.  Total miles is 22 miles plus one LOCK. It should be faster in this direction.  Good luck.
