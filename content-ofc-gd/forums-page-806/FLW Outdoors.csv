BASS EDITION ! hahah I made the mistake the first time of getting the walleye edition.... bad move ! I was like, where the heck is all the BASSIN stuff.  Its a great read I think, and I dont get into reading that often !  and for only $4...... I think its a steal !  Theres lots of good tips and articles in there.... if you haven't grabbed one yet.... I would suggest it !  "
