369972,wask,2009-08-05 21:25:00,174,What size/ weight anchor do I need for a 12 foot aluminum boat just doing some pretty calm small lake fishing?  I've just never paid attention to the ones I've used in other peoples boats.  Thanks in advance.
369974,DRIFTER_016,2009-08-05 21:30:00,10439,10# Navy or Mushroom style should work fine.
369976,crappieperchhunter,2009-08-05 21:36:00,2582,I use a 15LB mushroom. I retired my 10LB mushroom. Somedays it just wasn't enough.
369980,BillM,2009-08-05 21:49:00,17367,Include 6ft of chain before the anchor and you'll never have to worry about it not catching...
370022,danbo,2009-08-05 23:55:00,2646,Walmart..5lb. plastic-coated Dumbell works OK.
370164,Rich,2009-08-06 11:43:00,3927,"I use a 10lb mushroom for my 14 footer, works just fine.  In the past I used a Javex Bottle filled with sand, tied a rope to the handle and was good to go. I only did this on small bodies of water though and don't recommend it as a main source of anchor on larger bodies of water."
