The fishing has been great to say the least! Many big fish boated and released to fight another day. With the weather we have been having keeping on top of the fish has been tough, one day you find them in tight the next day way out. Our most consistant program has been with spin doctors and A-tom-miks. Wire divers set back 150 on a #2 have been hot for big fish as well as the 300' coppers.  here is some pics enjoy  Ryan Hare We Pound 'Em Sportfishing  Just over 29lbs            some prefish pics         "
