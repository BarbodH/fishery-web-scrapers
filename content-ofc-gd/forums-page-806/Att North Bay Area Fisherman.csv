I'm not fortunate enought to have a boat/motor (yet) but I do have a nice 16 ft canoe.  Can anyone suggest a few good places to take the canoe out and catch some fish.  I've been up the lavase a few times, but the fishing wasn't the best.  I've tried Circle Lake, dead in the middle of North Bay, to my surprise, I caught several small pike and even a few largemouth bass.  Any other good areas? Does anyone know if Four Mile Lake holds anything?  Thanks"

Always wanted to give it a shot myself.  Let me know how you do if you do try it.  There are lots of good spots on Nipissing but I would not head out onto the big lake in a canoe.
369775,LucG,2009-08-05 14:18:00,779," I've allways looked at those from a fishing point of view, but allways just assumed the only thing it held was a few beavers. Is there a way into that lake, or will I have to drag the canoe from the hwy.  There is also another two lakes not far at all call twin lakes. Coming into North Bay on Hwy 17."
