369749,evster,2009-08-05 13:29:00,367,"My wife and I went over to Island Lake this weekend and as usual it was a fun day of fishing with a good amount of bass.  Most of the bass are around the 1.5-2 pound mark but they still make for a fun day.  We did get one nice one though.  I started the day off with a decent 2 pounder.    Then my wife when on a catching spree.    This catching spree included the biggest of the day which weighed in right on 3.5 pounds.  She was happy to finally catch some fish this year let alone a nice one like this.    She was so happy about catching all these fish she gave this one a smootch.    I felt left out so I decided to give my next fish a smooch as well.    And finally I caught another little guy, not as impressive as my wife's day though!  "

369784,Rattletrap2,2009-08-05 14:34:00,1652,Those are some awesome fish! What were you guys using for lures/bait?
369787,evster,2009-08-05 14:42:00,367, All the fish were caught using senkos.  Tried a couple of things but this ended up being what they wanted.  The interesting thing is that all the fish were caught while a certain group was playing on the ipod...everytime they came on we caught a fish.  Thats the secret I won't share  .
369809,bigzinc10,2009-08-05 15:21:00,38,"Great fish!!! Nice job. Is there a fee to fish at Island Lake?? Also, can you get that kind of action by fishing off the shore??"
369814,evster,2009-08-05 15:30:00,367," Ya there is since its a conservation area.  I believe its like $4.50 a person or something like that and then there was also a launch fee.  I have never fished from shore and wherever I have caught fish has been off shore a bit, so I can't really help with that.  I would say give it a try there is some access, but I think it gets pretty busy on weekends."
