I bought two new plastic enclosures for the batteries, but they wont fit as they are taller than the batteries and i wont be able to put the seat down. Ive been running them for a long time now without an issue. BUt i saw my boxes sitting in the garage yesterday and i keep asking myself if i should inquire if their is an issue that they arent in the boat."

369899,blaque,2009-08-05 18:15:00,2419,when were you in my boat
369903,Terry,2009-08-05 18:20:00,14456,"the only real reason for a battery box is to stop it from moving, if they move against something the vibration can wear a hole in the battery and if there is enough room they can tip or the terminals can touch something so get a strap and fasten it to the floor and you are good to go"
369926,blaque,2009-08-05 19:31:00,2419,"Thanks Terry.......They are already boxed in by virtue of being inside the back seats pretty tightly , so i think ill concentrate my efforts on the next issue in line. Always something to focus on when theres a boat in the garage"
