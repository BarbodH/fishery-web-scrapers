369733,Jer,2009-08-05 12:54:00,1426,"We have stayed at Birch Hill a couple times for ice fishing. Real nice, clean and large cottages. If they have the best rate as well, that's where I would stay. Say hi to Henry."
369735,mash,2009-08-05 12:58:00,3,"Jer,   Thanx for the info, and i will say ""hi"" for you."
369833,Woodsman,2009-08-05 16:11:00,1286,I have stayed at both Birch Hill & Cozy Camp & can recommend both. First time up there I was at Birch Hill but after that when I couldn't get into Birch Hill as they were booked up I tried Cozy Camp and have repeated my trips to them quite a few times. The 2 bdrm cottage on the point is my favorite if available.  Rick  BTW: It's Lake Nosbonsing.

I have been going since 1994 with nothing but good things to say. The cottage on the point is my favorite as well but I have never been able to get into in the summer.  Good Luck"
