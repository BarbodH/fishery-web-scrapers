368147,Marko,2009-07-30 21:52:00,854," Stop by kitchener will you lol. You have no idea how tempted i am to go fish up there lol. Today me and a buddy of mine were map questing Sault Ste Marie, just wanted to see how far it actually is......and its prety far."
368156,pike slayer,2009-07-30 22:13:00,1177,"Ya from kitchener its a good 8hours, definitely not worth the drive unless you have the proper truck and boat or a 4wheeler to get to the lakes. If you have those then you can get in on some great fishing around here, its some pretty rough country around here. i'll do guiding for you southern ontario guys wanting to come up here and get on good fishing haha ya but Orest is a special guy that just loves talking about fishing dont matter if its a pro or some weirdo down at the river, he certainly loves his job and hes the perfect guy for it to. Dr. Salevlinus if you talk my boss into giving me payed day off or you can match the amount that im getting then i'll go with ya any day of the week haha! I just live on top of the hill and i rarely ever go down to the river to fish. i can't wait for this long weekend, gonna lay into mass piles of big pike and maybe some wallys up by aubrey falls this weekend, definitely gonna be roughing it!"
368162,redneck666,2009-07-30 22:30:00,563, where is aubrey lake? my buddy says he caught some nice walleye there earlier in the season and a nice accidental whitefish.
368188,pike slayer,2009-07-30 23:34:00,1177,"drive to the end of the ranger lake road, take a left and drive about 7-8km and you will see aubery falls generating station, keep going a little farther, take a right and there you go. its about 120km up the 129 from thessalon"
368197,troutologist,2009-07-31 00:10:00,951,Lived in KW for quite a few years. Its not a bad drive at all.  Lots to see and the construction has made 69 alot better. If you're not towing a boat you can make it in just over 7 without meal stops.  If you're into going through the states and have a radar detector you can get there in 6ish.  No shortage of places to explore with easy access.    I miss it. I just can't get excited about catfish.
368251,Dara,2009-07-31 02:05:00,3052,"Well, no eyes in Lake George tonight. Even the pro fishermen got skunked so I feel a bit better about it.   I got my varnishing done and the rain held off  Had to do up 5 of these.  stupid pics won't post again"
368331,Chop Izumi,2009-07-31 05:00:00,2,I have yet to catch a salmon
368751,redneck666,2009-08-01 18:16:00,563,"well i was at the locks today, goin for whitefish... i had a bite and that was it, so i started casting my cleo out in the current and hooked a massive salmon! but it shook a couple times and it was gone.... then i started throwing the cleo a little closer and then bam, a little smallie barely big enough to fit the lure in its mouth, haha, and this was all off the western pier!!! i tell ye that little smallie was the climax of this crappy day"
369070,Dara,2009-08-03 02:09:00,3052,For some reason they will post now   
369097,Kinger,2009-08-03 04:04:00,351,"I;ve never fished the western pier for salmon, got any tips?"
369300,redneck666,2009-08-04 02:34:00,563,"  not really that was a first for me too, i just went up the pier to where the current is and cast out my cleo and let it drift down with the current and waited a bit then started reeling..."
369447,xeon,2009-08-04 15:56:00,350,Dont get me started on the ssm salmon folks. The more yellow on the salmon the better.
369661,chinookhunter,2009-08-05 02:56:00,68,Cant wait for the chinooks!!
369692,Kinger,2009-08-05 04:16:00,351, Testify!!
369699,archie_james_c,2009-08-05 07:14:00,618,  Raaaaaaise the roof my brotha!!!
369891,redneck666,2009-08-05 18:03:00,563,lol! when the heck are the salmon commin??? havent seen a whole lot yet.... and i just seen some geese today going south in a V already.....
369901,redneck666,2009-08-05 18:18:00,563,"oh ya haha and i was at the locks the other evening and tried for eyes' but nothing and went to the western pier and cast out a cleo where the bait fish were and some nice bass came up and a few whities i think, but nothin bit, but there were smallies everywhere!!! and they wouldnt bite my teardrop but continuously stole my maggots..... and once again even the night bite didnt bring in any whites...."
367750,redneck666,2009-07-29 21:21:00,563,"im lookin to get out to the local locks soon to catch some salmon, what time should i go to be able to catch them feeding and be able to bring a feed home of not half rotten fish?..... and what spoons and/or baits produce?"
367780,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2009-07-29 22:36:00,0,"for the atlantics i think you'd want to be down there already.  if you are speaking of the pacific salmon then you'd be looking at the peak of the run occurring in late august, early september.  truthfully, i'd be down there early if you want nice feeder fish!  lots of the soo locals use buzz bombs when fishing from shore although i've always been more akin to using lighter, less likely to snag presentations with cleos and pixies.  i hope this was helpful but the question is pretty vague."
367794,redneck666,2009-07-29 23:24:00,563," lol, i dont know what you mean about pixies or vague.....  and ya the info. so far helped thanks."
367796,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2009-07-29 23:33:00,0,a pixie is a spoon made by blue fox tackle. vague means the question you asked was kind of general
367800,redneck666,2009-07-29 23:42:00,563,"oohh haha, oh and  are the kings around the same time as pacific?"
367804,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2009-07-29 23:51:00,0,kings are one if the pacific salmon.  they will start arriving shortly (although i've heard of a few caught already)...pinks will be late august/early september...  i myself am more concerned with the return of steelhead to the north shore of superior.  MUAHAHAHAHAHAHA!
367817,redneck666,2009-07-30 00:38:00,563,"lol well, i'd like to get into some steelhead too, what are some good methods that dont involve fly fishing around the locks??? actually a guy in a different forum told me this:     ""Try using a bottom bouncing setup with roe bags to catch the steelhead. Attach pencil lead suspended on a five-inch tag of line from a three-way swivel about 40 or 50 inches above your spawn sack. You need to use light line and cast out far to get good bites at the rapids this time of the year"".                           is this a good way to catch em?"
367850,Kinger,2009-07-30 02:13:00,351,"As the good Dr. said, the atlantics are there right now. Pinks, Chinooks and Cohos aka Pacifics come mid to late august, still a few weeks off.  I hate buzz bombs and use the  little cleo approach.  As for steelhead, if you have chest waders, you're gonna want to hit the rapids on whitefish island. Drifting roe is far better than bottom bouncing from what i've seen and heard.  I plan on spending the fall and winter trying out my new steelhead gear in the rapids."
367853,pike slayer,2009-07-30 02:16:00,1177,"justin that sounds like a snag master and more of a hassele then anything. i really like using the 2/5 or 3/4 little cleos in rainbow, hammered silver/green, hammered silver/blue and for the pixies i've used the silver and pink. also mepps #3 or #4 aglias or blue fox vibraxs."
367855,redneck666,2009-07-30 02:17:00,563," theres a problem right there, i dont have chest waiders but im not afraid to get into water up to my nuts either, lol thats how i get my brooks from the creeks. it does make it a little uncomfortable for the bike ride home though!"
367869,Dara,2009-07-30 02:35:00,3052,"  LMAO...you ain't never been to the rapids have you  Insulated waders, sock feet with felt sole boots. Anything else is uncomfortable and dangerous  St Marys rapids flow at approximately 500,000 gallons per second (3000 m3/sec)with a 20' vertical drop in about a 1 km length. It is not a trout creek. I thinh Dr Sal would know the specs better. I'm kinda guessing"
367881,redneck666,2009-07-30 02:42:00,563,oh i've caught a couple 20+lbs salmon outta the rapids last fall. but i dont really see how the not having waders is dangerous...?
367885,Dara,2009-07-30 02:47:00,3052,"  well, its pretty cold, and neoprenes help you float if you fall down"
367895,Kinger,2009-07-30 02:58:00,351,That water is ridiculously cold. There is no way I would wade in there without neoprenes.
367906,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2009-07-30 03:15:00,0,before i could drive a car i used to fish it in summer in my old sneakers and swim shorts.  many an atlantic salmon made a fool of me and my 6.5 foot shimano combo from CTC.  i definitely wouldn't venture back there now without waders.  rivers about 60 deg F right now... lol  here's a site from the american side that gives some basic info about what's going on in the river...  http://www.lssu.edu/arl/conditions.php
367919,troutologist,2009-07-30 03:36:00,951,"That wade was alright until you hit one hole, eh luc. I could never put a more than an hour or too without waders, it gets cold after a while.  Ahh the salmon run at the locks, Im gonna miss that circus. I saw some amateur biologists trying to strip dirty old black hookjawed males for spawn last year. ""must be spawned out"" they opined.  Enjoy the jackassery fellas"
367925,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2009-07-30 03:44:00,0,one hole was definitely too many... i can't wait to see the garbage bag posse come out of the woodworks. once a year these fanatical anglers dust off their old 1980's brownings and go downtown to bag watermarked pinks and black as coal chinooks. Mmmmmmmmmmm...  Mile 11 on the garden is the same.  A ton of americans bagging zombie salmon to take home and eat...those that don't get immediately cooked up on the charmaster 3000. screw salmon.  steel and 'hos are coming!
367949,pike slayer,2009-07-30 10:34:00,1177,hahaha garbage bag posse! i swear when the salmon are running its a full moon cause all the weirdos come out! i say the farther away from the bus terminal the better if you even dare going down there haha!! They all think that your a fellow fisher so you are their best friend and they always tell you their life story and that they are amazing fisherman when they are using these monster rod and reels from 1980 and 50lb test that looks even older casting out buzz bombs.You never want to catch a fish around them either cause they all start walking over to you like zombies to come talk to you to see the fish and see what your using. catch a fish and run!!!
368022,Dara,2009-07-30 15:39:00,3052,"It is pretty funny. Orest must love it. A lineup out the door of people buying buzzbombs. A thousand ""anglers"" trying to snag a pink that is so soft the hook pulls right through it. Then somebody hooks into a King and the lines are all tangled. Gotta hand it to the city for making the fishing platform, complete with downrigger mounts."
368043,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2009-07-30 17:12:00,0,trying to get out fishing somewhere today but it's tough to find a dance partner when it's a thursday and it's raining.
368049,Dara,2009-07-30 17:22:00,3052,"  Its not raining here...I'm trying for tonight, but I gotta get a coat of varnish on some boxes first, then if its not raing...eyes at lake george or atlantics at the tail race?"
368057,PikeMolester,2009-07-30 17:48:00,428,How long will it take me to get from Montreal to where your fishing? lol
368063,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2009-07-30 18:23:00,0,"  if you're bob gainey, and can take out the team jet, perhaps we have a date!"
368070,redneck666,2009-07-30 18:35:00,563,"haha, well when can i have a shot at some steel??"
368145,Kinger,2009-07-30 21:46:00,351,"I'm gonna try for some eyes' tonight, rain or shine."
