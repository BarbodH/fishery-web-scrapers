Not sure if you have ever given Fringe a chance but I downloaded and really enjoyed it.  ... and got completely sucked into Smallville as well.... what are you going to do? It's Superman!!!  bullybass
369698,Dozer,2009-08-05 04:54:00,896,"... the american version of ""The Office""?"
369725,blaque,2009-08-05 12:28:00,2419,"Has no-one ever scene Mr. Show?????? Think it ran from like 95-98 on HBO. Ive got it all on DVD and still go back to it for a laugh. Still some of the funniest TV i think ive ever watched. Its definitely one of those, ....you either think its side splitting hilarious , or you dont get it LOL  "
369812,mepps,2009-08-05 15:28:00,1301,"Dexter is awesome, take a look at Breaking Bad too! And Top Gear is the best of the best IMO - plus you have 14 seasons you can download!"
368893,jayess,2009-08-02 06:06:00,187,"someone already mentioned it, but Departures is by far my favourite show of all time.  might depend on your current state of life, but i find it incredibly funny, educational, and really inspiring.  worth checking out a trailer on youtube, at the least."
368894,eze76,2009-08-02 08:24:00,70,    YESSSSHHHHHHHH!!!!!! I AGGREEE   also entourage even tho ive only started watching it recently 
368895,Ben_Daniels,2009-08-02 08:37:00,435,"1. ""THE WIRE""    Best TV show of all time in my opinion.  2. ""Eastbound and Down""    Really funny, its only had one season but theres gunna be a second season soon, its written by Will Ferrel so you know its funny  -Ben"
368898,PAZE,2009-08-02 11:30:00,132,"I have the say House is one of my best shows to watch, and then, the Two Canucks that battle, Kenny VS Spenny, if you want a good laugh and bad camera shooting watch this."
368917,Fishnwire,2009-08-02 13:49:00,983,"I downloaded the whole first season of ""The Wire""...I kept hearing it described as ""the best show on TV.""  I couldn't get through the first episode.  It did nothing for me.  ""Eastbound and Down""...amazingly funny, seen them all, looking forward to more.  ""Kenny and Spenny"" were funny at first, but I'm starting to think its all just scripted.  Has ANYONE out there seen an animated show called ""Frisky Dingo"", on AdultSwim?  I'm obsessed with it but have never met/spoken with another human being who has ever heard of it.  I'd put a link to some clips from YouTube, but they're not really family friendly.  BTW...30 Rock is the most brilliant network TV sitcom ever.  Better than Seinfeld and Cheers put together.  (IMO)  These are the shows mentioned here I've never tried but will be attempting to track down today:  - Departures - Firefly - The Guild - Brotherhood - Generation Kill - Primeval - Whale Wars  Thanks for all the suggestions.  Maybe I'll have some reviews to follow."
368955,CLofchik,2009-08-02 16:54:00,854," Hell my girlfriend couldn't care less about cars and still likes the show.  Picture a bunch of 12-year olds running a television show about cars, only it is as awesome as you pictured it in your head.  Have you ever wondered what would happen if you put a 225hp outboard on a Toyota pickup?  How many camping trailers can a Volvo 240 jump?   Generation Kill is, um for adult audiences only.  Band Of Brothers in Iraq without the sentimentality, lot's of little girls blown up, and a few of the actual Marines from the unit have cameo's.  It's worth watching just for a few of monologues, which um I can't really repeat here.  Nobody's mentioned HBO's Rome yet so I'll chuck that one in there.  Possibly my fav TV show of all time, a 2 season drama about the period of Roman history between Caesar coming to power, his assassination and the war between Marc Anthony & Octavian.  Beautifully shot, it tries to stay fairly historically accurate, and also exceedingly brutal.  Battlestar Galactica is awesome, even if you're not a big sci-fi fan.  And for something lighter, and well fishing related, not alot of people have seen The Fishing Adventurer.  Low-budget, light hearted show but fairly interesting, only a single season though."
368956,ohhenrygsr,2009-08-02 16:59:00,947,- Dirty Jobs - Deadliest Catch - mythbusters - Top Gear - Weeds - Trailer Park Boys - breaking Bad - World Series Of Poker - What's that all about
368992,Kenny G,2009-08-02 20:15:00,118,Entourage cracks me up! I think Dexter is a fantastic show.
369096,Jonny,2009-08-03 04:00:00,1380,"BATTLESTAR GALACTICA - The new series - four seasons of it --- I thought it was awesome. It all has to be watched in sequence, staring from the pilot, to make sense.  ROME - Season 1 and 2 (Ancient Rome) --- again, awesome.  LONESOME DOVE (Western) - 4 parts, six hours ---  a great duster, stellar performances by Robert Duvall and Tommy-Lee Jones."
369139,4thgen,2009-08-03 14:25:00,157," I've seen two episodes so far and both have been so full of failure, it's laughable. I will watch it again because it's pretty entertaining but they really come off as a bunch of brainless hippies, aside from the captain.   Arrested Development I can't believe this show hasn't been mentioned yet. Prison break was alright if you stick to only the first season."
369141,Ziki,2009-08-03 14:54:00,128,"californication, not for with the kids"
369273,Northhunter,2009-08-04 00:59:00,214," That would've been one of my pics - been canned for a while (unfortunately), probably why I didn't think of it. Another one better watched in sequence.  Re; Generation Kill - definitely ""for adults only"", but it's true to what actually took place. At least they didn't sugar coat it."
369286,Marko,2009-08-04 01:50:00,854,"Southland anybody? What else is good two and a half men, House. Started watching dexter, well my gf made me and i just got sick of it not really sure why"
369288,Fishnwire,2009-08-04 02:05:00,983,"  OK...I watched the first three Whale Wars...you're right about them coming across as ""brainless hippies"".  I can't help but agree that those Japanese whaling boats aren't doing a lot of ""research"" though.  I think they're definitely exploiting a legal loop-hole...but I guess that means they're not doing anything illegal.  Why would anyone want to eat whale blubber anyway?  Different strokes I guess.  Arrested Development was brilliant.  I have them all on DVD and it seems I catch something new every time I watch that show.  I hear they're making a movie.  It'll probably suck.  What is ""Southland""?  I watched the first season of Californication, it was good but I lost interest early on in the second season.  I'm not sure why.  Same thing with Dexter.  I'm downloading Generation Kill right now...It's coming in real slow though, I think its going to take a couple of days or more.  I hope it's worth it."
369290,bullybass,2009-08-04 02:12:00,144,I will second Californication.... great show!!! and the lesser known and horribly shot one season show... Lucky Louie... definitely not for the kids but some of the stuff they come up with in there... hilarious!!!!
369294,Fishnwire,2009-08-04 02:23:00,983,"  I've seen all of Lucky Louie.  It was awesome...I was hoping for more.  I had totally fogot about that show.  Good one, bullybass...you must like obscure shows too."
369298,crankbait,2009-08-04 02:31:00,82," Ya whale wars is entertaining. watching these people who lack the skills perform these stunts out on the water. There attempts at stopping the whalers are so pathetic I don't even know why they are even trying. I'm surprised no one got seriously hurt or killed in the last season, although there have been a few close calls. After some research upon watching the show, I found out the minke whale they are risking their lives to protect aren't even endangered."
369299,wask,2009-08-04 02:34:00,174,
369330,Fishnwire,2009-08-04 06:18:00,983,"  I found myself somewhat fascinated that people could be so passionate about something.  Their efforts are obviously a little misplaced...what with so many real problems facing humanity...but I couldn't help but think that if more people were moved to devote their lives to unselfish service of a (hopefully less stupid) cause they believed in, maybe we'd start to see positive change in this world.  As far as these particular hippie burnouts go, they're not doing any harm.  They're endangering only themselves, and it's not like any of us would be negatively effected if they actually were able to disrupt the Japanese whaling industry.  They're far from being my heros, but I don't look down on them with the kind of obvious distain a lot of people seem to harbor.  You are correct about menke whales not being ""endangered"", they are however listed as ""threatened"" by the Convention on Internation Trade of Endangered Species."
369331,Rich,2009-08-04 06:20:00,3927,I watched 7 seasons of Smallville last couple months. Gotta say at first I found it cheesy but it really sucked me in the further I went.
369405,MuskyBill,2009-08-04 14:26:00,311,"'Breaking Bad' with Brain Cranston. I think he won an award for that show. I missed the first season, but I haven't missed it since."
369409,Lunker777,2009-08-04 14:36:00,866,"hahah weird... but I have all 10 seasons of ""Friends"" on DVD......  Ive gotten bit by the Big Brother bug here this season.... I think the key to that show if you have to watch it from the beginning....  Food network has a bunch of good ones aswell.... I like food... and tv.... good combo  If you can get HD.... Rush, Equater, Treasure, and there is one more I cant think of... but they have a BUNCH of good shows..... Mark Krupa in Hd is SWEET !"
369432,DRIFTER_016,2009-08-04 15:12:00,10439, The same thing happened to me with Buffy the Vampire Slayer.
369437,Hooked,2009-08-04 15:28:00,891,"I pretty much dl all my tv shows.  Here's a few:  It's always sunny in philadelphia (mentioned by several, very funny show)  Jericho (no longer runs, but a fantastic show)  Top Gear (also mentioned already, great show)  The I.T. Crowd (it's british, but man it's the funniest show I've seen, helps that I'm in I.T. as well, but it's definately worth checking out even if you're not in I.T.)  The Mentalist (not a bad show, might be worth you checking out)   Now I got stuff to dl with these other shows mentioned I haven't heard of, cool."
369453,CLofchik,2009-08-04 16:33:00,854," Top Chef is probably the best ""reality"" program out there......it's like Big Brother meets Hell's Kitchen.....only y'know, good  Then there's food & motorcycles, Feasting On Asphalt.  Alton Brown from Good Eats gets a road crew together and ride from coast-coast and then up the Mississippi feasting on local, out of the way hole in the wall eateries.  I liked the sequel going up the Mississippi best.  Long Way Round is another good one, mini-series following Obi-Wan Kenobi (Ewan McGregor) and an actor buddy riding motorcycles around the world.  Followed by Long Way Down through Africa (which wasn't as good), and they're in the process of doing another sequel, Long Way Up through South America.  Even if you're not a biker it's still pretty interesting watching two neophyte actors riding bikes through Mongolia & Siberia."
368739,Fishnwire,2009-08-01 16:05:00,983,"So I'm on strike and promised my wife I wouldn't spend everyday at camp.  I'm bored out of my mind and looking for something cheap (free) to do with my time right here at home.  I've been downloading TV shows that I've never seen before, sometimes a whole season at a time.  Some of them pretty good and I've been wondering what else I'm missing.  I'm talking about non-network shows like MadMen, Sons of Anarchy, Dexter, Deadwood, True Blood, Nurse Jackie, Weeds...if you never heard of those shows you're missing out on some of the best TV ever made.  Every episode is like a little movie...like how the Sopranos when it was on...really well made and total engrossing.  Anyway, can anyone recommend any shows that might not be on my radar?  I'll watch anything good, comedy, drammas, action, whatever...as long as it's well made.  No British shows please...I can't understand what they're saying.  Thanks, folks."

It was an HBO Mini-Series but I had only heard about it because I had read the book (I don't get HBO  )  If you like Jesse James (Monster Garage, etc.) he had a series or at least a couple specials that I don't think aired in Canada - don't remember what it/they were called."
