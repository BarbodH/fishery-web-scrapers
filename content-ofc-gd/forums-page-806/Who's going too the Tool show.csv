I even thought TB was awesome....a 2 piece band with a guy that sometimes comes out with a flute or sax. Unreal!!! The drummer plays a wicked solo during Tools show.  As a warning though....but you may know this having seen them...don't bring a camera. They will take it immediatley and not return it; no questions asked!  Cheers,  Paul"
