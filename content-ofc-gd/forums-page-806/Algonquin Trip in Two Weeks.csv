In a couple of weeks myself and some friends will be heading into Algonquin for a five night portaging and fishing trip. We are starting from the Lake Opeongo departure point and heading East through to Wright's Lake. Camping there for one night and than hitting the big portage into Dickson where we will head up to Lavieille for three nights. On the way out we will stay on Dickson for a night and than out of the park. I plan on using a light action 3-way setup. Mainly fishing for trout along with some bass. Are there any pike in any of these lakes?  Being a recreational fisherman, I am not too knowledgable about trout fishing. Basically, all I know is that I need to get down to where the trout are now. Any particular points of interest along this route and any cool things to look at in the park as well as any fishing spots or tips that anyone would like to share would be greatly appreciated. Also, are there any particular lures and colours I should stick to?"
