369737,bigzinc10,2009-08-05 13:07:00,38,"Hey guys, what does it mean to make a lure ""wake""? I tried googling it, but no answer. Sorry for the trivial question, but I am trying my best to learn about different lures and techniques. This forum has been very useful and helpful already. Thanks all."
369741,Lunker777,2009-08-05 13:20:00,866,"Im not sure either... but I will venture an educated guess....  I know there are such things as ""wake baits"" that stay JUST below the surface creating a bit of a wake as you bring it in.... now I would say you can get the same affect with certain lures that will allow you to keep them just below the surface.....  Dont hold me to it though ! haha"
369743,Jer,2009-08-05 13:21:00,1426,"I could be wrong...but it sounds like running your bait (especially a spinner of some sort) just under the surface. Usually referred to as ""bulging"" your bait. Leaves a wake in it's trail."
369744,Mike Pike,2009-08-05 13:21:00,1332,"I believe that refers to retrieving a a lure, like a spinner, up on or near the surface so that it actually creates a wake."
369774,bigzinc10,2009-08-05 14:16:00,38,So than I am guessing you have to have a steady fast-medium retrieval? And a wake I am guessign from your answers is just the water waves or ripples created by the lure?
369776,highdrifter,2009-08-05 14:19:00,2534,Yep.  Burning a bucktail just below the surface will give you that enticing wake...  Great technique in mid to late summer during low light conditions...  cheers HD
369829,camillj,2009-08-05 15:59:00,1988,Either that .. or .. when you whisper in its ear ... just after it goes to sleep ...and then get slapped upside the head
369838,Mike Pike,2009-08-05 16:29:00,1332,"I think a lot of us were using this technique before it actually had a name.  I know that when I see fish busting bait on the surface, I like throwing a spinner and not only 'waking' it but speeding the retrieve so it hops out of the water every now and again.  I really believe it increases my strikes."
369855,TC1OZ,2009-08-05 16:56:00,987,"make a lure ""wake"" = wake made by a lure"
369896,Fishnwire,2009-08-05 18:12:00,983,"You guys are all wrong.  It's the little get-together that you and your friends have after you lose a favourite lure.  Close friends gather to have a few drinks and remember the life and times of the missing lure.  Unlike the lure's funeral, the lure's wake is intended to be a celebration of life, where food and drink are consumed in large ammounts and joyful memories of the recently departed are recounted.  "
369902,Rich,2009-08-05 18:19:00,3927,"lol Fishnwire!  It is indeed reeling your bait just under the surface to create a wake. Doesn't necessarily have to be a fast retrieve, keep your rod tip up and begin reeling the split second the bait hits the water and you can pull it off a little slower. Also a good technique for hard baits.. jointed Rapala J9 or J11 reeled in that way is pretty tough to beat for big old bass, pike, & musky!"
369907,bigzinc10,2009-08-05 18:33:00,38,Haha jokes!!  
369911,Cudz,2009-08-05 19:01:00,2652,"There are lots of specific wakebaits that can be retrieved really slowly.  Mann's 1-minus, Stormsub wart, Bandit footloose, Xcalibur xw6, and Lucky craft but none of them work.  Don't try them.  Don't buy them on Ebay. They are terrible lures.  No chance that any bass or pike would ever hit one. It is not exciting when you get blowup after blowup on surface lures. Step away from the wakebait!!      "
369913,jediangler,2009-08-05 19:04:00,1923,"If it isn't catching you any fish, you slam it on the water a few times to ""wake"" it up. Then threaten to put it back in the tackle box unless it starts to produce. All lures are claustraphobic...and afraid of the dark."
369954,Dozer,2009-08-05 20:24:00,896,"Wake n' bake, I mean, wake and bait!  Morning ritual..."
369973,misfish,2009-08-05 21:30:00,29133,"Also known as boiling yer bait just below the surface. Work awesome over deep weeded areas. Just ask aniceguy.  It,s an awesome way to fish earlly morn and late evening."
370200,Rich,2009-08-06 13:15:00,3927, Makes for a great fishing trip lol
