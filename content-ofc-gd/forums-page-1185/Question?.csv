91568,Greencoachdog,2007-07-07 19:24:00,8163,"That would be the sacrificial anode Dan. Easy to find and replace, some adjusting may be needed the first time out on the water."
91570,DanTheMan,2007-07-07 19:34:00,257,Thanks Bud!! I appreciated it
91575,trapshooter,2007-07-07 19:52:00,1234,it's a trim tab
91581,BLACKFISH88,2007-07-07 20:04:00,191,No it's not a trim tab it is what gcd said it's an anode plate. This happened to my brother inlaw last year on walleye opener soon as we hit the water heard a big noise and I figured we hit something after we inspected the prop major damage to it. Hope your prop is alright gcd is also right easy fix.
91582,misfish,2007-07-07 20:05:00,29133,"Trim tab like Ben said. It helps with thr straight running of the motor (pulling/pushing) from one side or the other.You get a new one and you will have to adjust it so the motor runs true. If it pull/pushs to the left,move right,visa versa ."
91584,BLACKFISH88,2007-07-07 20:13:00,191,Sorry guys also called a trim tab. LOL.
91585,Muskieman,2007-07-07 20:21:00,2472,"anode, or trim tab  < I've also heard of a trimamabob or antiwrestleyerenginabob."
91595,misfish,2007-07-07 21:04:00,29133,"Sorry mistake,if it pulls left,turn left.visa versa to the right."
91622,DanTheMan,2007-07-07 23:23:00,257,"Hahaha,  I guess you guys are having fun with my question  Your right Brian,  I tried driving without it, and that was a big no-no.  Did she ever pull to right as soon as I let go the handle.Oh well, time to fix it.  Thanks for help guys Dan"
