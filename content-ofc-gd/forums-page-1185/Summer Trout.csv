91208,goby,2007-07-06 02:06:00,18,I rent a cottage on a small two mile long lake every August in Muskoka . The lake has a good supply of bass and there is also rainbows. The lake has a depth in a couple of places between 60' - 80'. In ten years I have only caught one rainbow in the early am. Can anyone suggest some summer techniques for producing more trout?

91242,silvio,2007-07-06 03:49:00,433,I would try meeps spinners and small rapalas such as the x rap.
91293,Dustinnn,2007-07-06 13:42:00,13,"find drop offs, and if using live bait, drop a minnow straight down with a egg sinker 12"" or more below your hook."
91318,Fishnfiend,2007-07-06 15:19:00,357,"Perhaps a spinner rig (similar to a worm harness, but only one hook) and a slip sinker would work.  That way, you could use a big enough sinker to get down, but let it freespool upon detection of a hit.  Count a couple seconds, close your bail and set your hook. Small, heavy spoons like cleos may work, too."
91468,goby,2007-07-07 02:04:00,18,I have had some success over the years trolling a deep diving crank bait early am or at dusk. I usually try a few passes along the shore with a water depth between 15 - 30 feet.
91476,danc,2007-07-07 02:29:00,4677,It's simple. Almost. All you have to do is find their preferred temperature range and they'll be there. Guaranteed.
91499,John Bacon,2007-07-07 06:09:00,3277,"I used to have a lot of success trolling cow bells (an 18"" or so wire with willow leaf blades) and a worm harness for rainbows.  Suprisingly, they seemed to hit best around 1:00pm on a bright sunny day."
