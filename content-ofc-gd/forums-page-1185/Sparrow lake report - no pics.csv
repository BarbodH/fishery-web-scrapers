We usually get there 2-3 times a year and this was our first trip of the year.  Tried our usual spot that Produces Pike in the spring and usually a few mid size LM..nothing Next couple of spots the same. heavy fishing pressure ( lots a boats today) and heavy wind made it difficult.  I manaaged one decent size largie after an hour or so but that was it for a while. Decided we would head up the lake for a bit of running and gunning.  Seemed to be the best idea as a few more fish were caught .Not a stellar day but interesting seeing some new water.  Highlight of the day Did see something I have not seen before ...lots of loons around toady and had one 'swim' almost under the boat ,man can they move.  Lowlight of the day .. youngest broke his new Fluger rod today getting it out of the van ..then couple hours later dropped his sunglasses in one of the back bays .  TB"
