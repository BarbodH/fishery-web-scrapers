90587,Jen,2007-07-04 06:23:00,833,"It has been a while since I have posted and that is because I haven't managed to catch any fish... Although I have been working pretty hard at it.  Went out with Sonny a couple of weekends ago, opening weekend for bass.  He picked me up in Port Maitland on Lake Erie with my youngest son, spent a couple of hours trolling... which to a little one is rather boring, unless of course your Uncle lets you drive the boat! No fish though.    Then I spent a couple of days up North on Mountain lake getting our place ready for Canada Day weekend... we have a 12 ft aluminum boat up there, and a little motor that has sat in the garage for 6 years.  Wasn't sure it would work and the boat needed a little work but with a little help from friends it all came together nicely...  We invited about 30 ppl to come and join us camping for the weekend... the pictures will give you an idea of how the weekend went... Although there were no fish, I can not say there was any lack of trying.  The drive lures ready!  Easton and the boys helping to set up  First Nights Sunset  Getting that motor ready... and it ran, unbelieveable!  Easton replacing the wood on the boat  Instant dock ( needed to cover all the swamp grass to get the boat in the water) Thanks to the guy on Hwy 6 that sells skids... great idea!  finally in the water, (don't laugh, those waiters kept the leaches off ) Easton couldn't stop laughing.  He was much cuter!  Bass here we come! (Huge bass, we could see them, threw everything at them and not one was interested... )  So we figured some live bait might work... grab kids and off we go    A stop at boat lake to see what they were catching  Then a little more bait hunting, all we came up with was a painted turtle   That the little boy in the picture above caught on a hook and worm.  Not great for bait but the kids loved watching it for a while.  Sonny making the world warmer.  Me and the boys after a long day of camping, fishing and not catching at the camp fire...mmm smores!  Heading home   Once home and unpacked my need to catch fish was still there... so I headed off to Lake Ontario to see if I could manage a perch or two... seems this wasn't my weekend for fishing, but the sunsets were rather beautiful...   Thanks to Easton , Sonny and everyone else who joined my family for the weekend... It was an awesome time!  Happy Canada Day everyone.  Hopefully my next report will include fish!  Cheers,  Jen"
90594,Victor,2007-07-04 08:07:00,1609,Those are some great pics Jen! Gotta make one of those lures for my car  Thanks for sharing!
90595,Tarzan's Jane,2007-07-04 08:15:00,1183,Well I don't feel so bad now lol.  Nice pics of your holiday weekend with family.  Love the black and white one and that campfire is definitely my kind of fire.   I have no doubt you will soon be bringing those fish in therefore little need to wish you luck.
90599,Shelley Cooper,2007-07-04 08:47:00,394,Nice to see you got out Jen....  Nice pic's too.. .thanks for sharing...
90601,solopaddler,2007-07-04 09:09:00,8605,"Great report Jen, it's not always about catching fish that makes a trip great....there are other more important things. Looks like a fun time."
90653,ccmtcanada,2007-07-04 12:50:00,7971,"Jen...Great report even though nothing was caught.  Guess that's why it's called ""fishing"" and not ""catching"".  It's great just to get out there, especially with family.  You are one cool mom and your kids will grow up and remember all those great fishing trips you took them on...and then pass it down to their children one day  The skunk will be gone soon...that's my prediction....I'll expect to see some fish by....let's say....Sunday! LOL"
90654,Smokey,2007-07-04 12:54:00,1278,"Thanks for the report Jen. There's something special about the black and white pics, classic."
90675,bowshep,2007-07-04 14:21:00,378,"Nice story Jen nice pic's. To catching fish is why you went, a bonus is catching the fish, but most important, its to stand at ahww in what you see that brings warmth to your heart. After seeing the moon on Fri night, it will always be a little more special from now on"
90681,charlesn,2007-07-04 14:55:00,551,"I guess that's why we all love fishing, it's not just about the catching!  Charles"
90700,LeXXington,2007-07-04 16:08:00,1928,looks like a great family outing
90748,Jen,2007-07-04 17:41:00,833,"Hey Victor,  Those Lures in my car come off the side of my fishing bag as I am heading home... getting a huge collection... one of these days they will get back in the tackle box... LOL  Nancy, you are right, Black and White photos always turn out so much nicer... The fires up north are always amazing... although this weekend we needed them for warmth ... I will anxiously await your next catch and report!  Cliff -  I guess that means I am going to have to try extra hard to make your predictions come true... (and stop using those dang preserved minnows in a bag, although they do fit nicely in my purse!)  Ken - That moon was amazing!  I am trying to remember to capture the beautiful moments on my camera, stay still long enough to see what is hard to see... thank you for that advice.   Family time means the world to me... when I am 80 these memories will keep a smile on my face!  Thanks for the replies everyone.  This is an awesome community!~  Cheers,  Jen"
90822,sonny,2007-07-04 21:44:00,511,had a great time with family and friends....we definatly are  lucky!!
90823,easton13th,2007-07-04 21:48:00,371,"Fantastic weekend! A big thanks to Jen and her family! Amazing place you have there I may just move in one day, you show up and I am there.  Easton"
90942,Photoz,2007-07-05 09:03:00,792,"Ah h h  h  h . . . .  .   .     our resident photojournalist / fisherperson is back! Looks like a gr r r r r  e  a  t spot, even if the fish weren't co-operating. But I don't understand one thing . . . .     why wear the waders? Those leaches are great bait . . . .     all you have to do is get a few people to stand in the water for a little while . . . .     then come out and pick the leaches off? Ready-made leach catchers?"
91049,lunkerbasshunter,2007-07-05 16:42:00,2585,to bad you didnt get any fish but looks like a great long weekend!  Cheers!
