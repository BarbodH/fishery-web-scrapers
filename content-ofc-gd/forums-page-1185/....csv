91501,Deg,2007-07-07 06:21:00,51,Hey Glen I think I saw a bunch of those cherry red tails floating in Lake Nipissing just after you left.  Maybe you need some fish'n glue so you won't lose the next ones . LOL  I could pick up some white ones for you and we can sit and dye them when I come down in Oct. if the snapper's aren't biting.
