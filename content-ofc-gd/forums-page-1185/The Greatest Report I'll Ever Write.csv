91246,Fishn Technishn,2007-07-06 04:11:00,198,"CONGRATULATIONS to you all!!! I keep telling my 3 to hurry up & get me me Grandkids. I DO remember all the fun with little ones & I MISS IT. A buddy suggested when my kids were born, to save the Newspaper from that Special day. I did so & my kids still have the papers with all the flyers etc. Really cool. Just slide into a green garbage bag & put on a hanger in the closet for safe keeping.  Now you will learn what ""shift work"" is all about!  FT"
91249,Rich,2007-07-06 04:25:00,3927," Literally! Quote of the night was when She was on the phone with her mom...  Mom: ""If you're having contractions, maybe you should be heading home from fishing?""  Sugarpacket: ""Gimme a break mom, my contractions are a half hour apart. I have plenty of time, plus every time I get a contraction a fish hits!""  True story!!  Thank you everyone for your well wishes and advice!"
91251,Deg,2007-07-06 04:35:00,51,"I had a son that size once Rich.  The only advice I can give you is save your money ... we calculated he ate $100 000.00 in groceries by the time he was 21. That's a lot of lures. lol  Seriously, congratulations on the new fishing buddy.  Take lots of pics, they grow up fast."
90957,Roy,2007-07-05 10:38:00,13728,"Congrats to you and you wife, Rich. You know, we tend to think that we are going to raise a child and make them into the best human person that we can. What really happens is that we all grow together and little (for the time being) Ethan, over the years will transform you and your wife into the best human persons you could be.  Great, great news."
90958,bucketmouthjohnny,2007-07-05 10:38:00,115,"Congrats Rich!! Your life will definitely change now, and so much for the better. You will see life in a whole new perspective and respect for your parents will grow every hour and every awakening cry you hear in the night. Yea, there will be some restless nights, trips to the doc at awful hours, poopie diapers, vomit, and loads of other non inspiring duties, but in the end, IT IS SO MUCH WORTHWHILE!!!  ENJOY RICH!!!! Best Wishes, John"

91008,thecraftyprince,2007-07-05 13:37:00,37,"""The Greatest Discovery""  Peering out of tiny eyes The grubby hands that gripped the rail Wiped the window clean of frost As the morning air laid on the latch  A whistle awakened someone there Next door to the nursery just down the hall A strange new sound you never heard before A strange new sound that makes boys explore  Tread neat so small those little feet Amid the morning his small heart beats So much excitement yesterday That must be rewarded must be displayed  Large hands lift him through the air Excited eyes contain him there The eyes of those he loves and knows But what's this extra bed just here  His puzzled head tipped to one side Amazement swims in those bright green eyes Glancing down upon this thing That make strange sounds, strange sounds that sing  In those silent happy seconds That surround the sound of this event A parent smile is made in moments They have made for you a friend  And all you ever learned from them Until you grew much older Did not compare with when they said This is your brand new brother This is your brand new brother This is your brand new brother  Congratulations Rich, that's some head of hair on the little guy !!"

Here's the only thing I will say to you... cherish the times you spend with your little one's. I know it seems like they're never gonna grow up fast enough and that you will have to change many of the things you've been doing, to accomodate the new family. They grow up fast, much faster than it seems when your living through it! Cherish these times, you don't get a 2nd chance! HH"
