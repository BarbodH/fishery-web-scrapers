91464,mikec,2007-07-07 01:22:00,26,"hey guys,  hitting a small stream close by my place tommorow morning for resident brookies/browns and was wondering your reccomendations on bait/lures?  I tried to dig worms for about an hour with no luck, the ground is way too dry.  Any other bait suggestions for trout that arent too hard to get?  some people have told me to use corn or marhmellows but i have never had luck with these.  I have a bunch of small panther martins and other size 1 or 0 spinners, but the stream is probably too shallow for these.  should i try them anyway?  also any other lures you use with success on small stream trout would be great!  Thanks,  Mike"

91467,pikeie,2007-07-07 01:53:00,380,"small, and i mean the smallest u can get countdown rapalas in perch colour or silver minnow i love these in my local streams and so do the brookies lol. the brookie in my avatar was 13 1/2 inches long and took a rapala. and definatly get some worms to drift weightless through the pools and riffles."
91558,jediangler,2007-07-07 18:19:00,1923,You could use some very tiny jig & grub combos. Something in the 1/32oz or 1/64oz sizes.
91562,FishHeadRic,2007-07-07 18:46:00,226,You can always just go to your local pet store and pick up some crickets and/or meal worms. Trout love em and they're relatively cheap. About $1.25/doz.    FHR
