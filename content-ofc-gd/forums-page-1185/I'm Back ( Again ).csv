91247,Deg,2007-07-06 04:13:00,51,Happy Birthday Gary ... I noticed you didn't mention your birthday or age in the email .... here I thought you didn't look a day over 62. LOL  Glad you are still with us and Lakair 2008 is only about 353 days away so i will expect to see you there.
91270,lunkerbasshunter,2007-07-06 11:14:00,2585,oh man that really sucks!  Glad you are on the comeback.  I am 30 years old and surely will put the ego asde if i ever feel not right!  Cheers!
91272,Spiel,2007-07-06 12:03:00,9065,....Happy Birthday Gary. Just continue to heed your own advice and you'll be just fine. Good health to you my friend. God bless.
91294,OhioFisherman,2007-07-06 13:44:00,6623,"Happy birthday Gary! May you see many more! I second the male ego thing, don`t tough it out get to the doctor!"
91299,FishHog,2007-07-06 14:03:00,7,"Happy B-day Gary.  I was wondering how you were doing just the other day.  Glad it sounds like your getting things back under control.  44lb of urine?  Wow, I always knew you were full of something, but I wouldn't have guessed that was it  Take care of yourself, and hope you get out fishing soon.  And just to make you feel better, I healthy, and have hardly wet a line this year.  FishHog"
91069,Garyv,2007-07-05 17:45:00,547,"Well after canceling this years trip to Lakair as my doc's requested I took another turn for the worse.  After the surgery in April things were looking up until the incision opened and infected requiring 8 weeks of VON daily.  With that problem my water retention was put in 2nd place on the fix list and then stupid me with the male ego ""Ill get better"" attitude took over.  In the end I was rushed by ambulance to hospital on June 22nd not being able to breath.  Yep good old congestive heart failure.  For the next 9 days I found out what is was like to be a waterfall.  2 IV injections daily to make you part with your ""water"" and in the end the result was went in hospital @ 244Lbs was released @ under 200lbs....now thats a lot of peeing!!!!.  I also did manage to get my existing heart problem to become worse and am now in the process of adjusting my all new med regime to meet my requirements.  Since todays my 63rd birthday and I'm still here after the last 3 months I would like to beg with anyone out there that ""if your not feeling right don't wait like I did until you do damage....go see your doc as soon a possible and get yourself taken care of no matter your age""  Don't be stupid like me and think you can do it by yourself.   OK enough preaching....except for due to my male ego I still have not wet a line this year and probably won't for another week or two.  Don't let that type of thing happen to you!!!!!"
91070,misfish,2007-07-05 17:45:00,29133,"My friend, welcome back ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,AGAIN LOL  Holly molly 63, a happy birthday to you sir. I always call my elders sir or mam"

91089,Joey,2007-07-05 18:24:00,9122,"Wow Gary, that really sucks.  You were definately missed at Lakair sir!  That is very sound advice, and I should know.  I too thought I'd be okay, but guess what, the doctors sometimes know what they're talking about don't they  Hang in there bud and take care of yourself.  We all miss you and you'll get out there soon enough.  Dang fish just mock us while we're out there fishing anyhow  Happy Birthday Hon  Joey"
