Within 10 mins first Chinook of the day  Then 10 minutes later the first rainbow of the day  I brought my wife out for the first time I have recently just got her into fishing and she was a bit aprehensive about going out and hooking into a big salmon but when she boated this one she was so happy I thought I wouldn't ever get her off the boat  It went quiet for about 1/2 hour and then bang double header which was really fun cause she was freakin pretty serious faces eh LoL  And then another double header  End of the day photo I am a big guy and my arms were freaking sore after holding this monster up   Best pic of the day   I have been out with Lloyd for Walleye, Salmon and Rainbow and haven't been dissapointed yet. He is running an OFC Special for July offering 10% off for the day we were only out until 10 because we had an appointment to go to but a total of 17 fish on and 12 boated made for an excellent day as always. The best thing about being out with Lloyd is that its only you and one other person which makes for an exciting day not having to wait to fight any fish. I will be going again very soon, my lil brother has been buggin me to take him out . I also have put a link to Lloyds site below if anyone is interested in a day that you'll definately go home with sore arms. http://www.reeltimecharters.net/uandme/ Cheers  Gnoddy"

91311,tonyb,2007-07-06 14:44:00,1637,Great report! thanks for sharing.  Amazing how hard the salmon can fight! they put pretty much all other freshwater fish to shame when it comes to a tug of war out in open water.  Tony
