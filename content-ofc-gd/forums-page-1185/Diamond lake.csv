90996,Stoty,2007-07-05 13:09:00,2910,"Can't say I have heard of the lake, but it sounds like a jewel!"
91010,Smokey,2007-07-05 13:40:00,1278,I lived on the lake for a few years. Mostly a Lake trout fishery with a few bass in the mix. I honest never had much luck this time of the year for anything other then bass but you can try lead core trolling for some trout. As for bass us the same tactics you would on any other lake you'll catch them. Not to break your hopes but my best fishing on the lake was always in the winter thru the ice.  If you have the chance your best best for fishing to to run over to Baptiste Lake and give it a try it's only a 5 min ride from there.  Good Luck
91145,fishingguy28,2007-07-05 20:37:00,98,"hey thanks a lot smokey..... yea the lake trout would be great but not really in the mood to work hard lol lol  i'm more than happy with the bass.... are there any weeds or pads on the lake.... oh yea, i'll be fishing out of a row boat....no motor!!!!  baptiste probably has boat and motor rentals, how are the bass over there!!!!"
91154,Smokey,2007-07-05 21:26:00,1278,Best bet would be the south end of the lake for shallow waters. I don't recall many weeds anywhere else in the lake.  Baptiste Lake is one of the best bass lakes in the area. I'm not sure who rents boats on the lake but there are a few resorts that should have some rentals. Elephant lake is another lake with some good fishing thats not too far away.
91190,mistaredone,2007-07-06 00:37:00,913,I have fished both lakes and you will have a blast on baptiste.  As for boat rentals give birch cliff lodge a call at 16133323316 they are great people and have the best boats on the lake.  Dont forget to bring steel leaders!!!!!
91204,John Bacon,2007-07-06 01:37:00,3277,"Baptiste Lake Marina also rents boats.  They are on Baptiste Lake Road south which goes right by Diamond Lake.  There is some good bass fishing on Baptiste; but you will probably catch more pike than bass.  There are also walleye, muskies, lake trout, and ling in Baptiste."
91237,fishingguy28,2007-07-06 03:08:00,98,wow thanks a lot.. i'll have to try out baptiste lake for sure!!!!!!
