91483,Mike the Pike,2007-07-07 02:57:00,3421,"I have converted to braid this year.I am using 30lb Stren Super Braid with 9lb diameter has not affected my fishing at all .Caught a nice pike with no leader my Rapala was hooked deeply in its mouth the line was frayed but did not break.If I had mono that Pike would have my Rapala Husky jerk in its mouth.I just got my return on my investment by keeping my expensive lures.And yes I was respooling my rods with Mono twice a year because of line twist and abrasions.In the long run I am saving with braid and I tell less fish stories about the one that got away.Floro carbon leaders are not for me.  This spring I bought some expensive Seagar florocarbon.15 bucks a roll 10lb test.The most fragile crappy mono I have ever purchased.Overated yes its invisible but not worth the hassles it comes with.  Hey Peter, Biteme get with it bud it  braid really is better  .Like Lew says if the little fish won't hit it then they are not worth it.  MTP"
91497,LesCulpJr,2007-07-07 04:55:00,75,MONO??? I've got briad thats 8 years old on some of my reels that I'm still waiting to wear out. And I fish...........Alot! The only time I'll change line is when something new comes out and I'll try the new line on one of my reels.  When I feel the need to use a leader I go with 20# floro Pline. I use to worry about running a leader alot till I met Rocky Crawford quite a few years ago. Said he doesn't even use one on simcoe! And you know what? I haven't had a prob. since.  Bass don't know what fishin line is. Its all about matching your equipment to the presentation you're offering the fish.
