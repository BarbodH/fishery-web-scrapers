Got 10 shakers and one big 27 pounder, my camera died but I have a video of the fish but have no dvd player on my comp.....had to do the video fast as it took forever to bring in the fish as it peeled out 400 feet of line on me so I can't enter it in the derby.....oh well, next time.  Sorry team one!  Fish were hitting and then taking off...missed a ton of fish today.  Fished out of Port Weller for those that wanna know!"

Can't upload the video cause I don't have a dvd player in my computer, not a long video...just enough time to see the size of the fish and thats it.  Bowen is really good out on the lake, even at 16 years old.....can't imagine how he will be in the future...gonna win alot of  tournaments."
