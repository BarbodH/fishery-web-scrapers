91138,ecxstriper,2007-07-05 20:14:00,343,I been trying to comb tribute to Team 3 and as I fish most salt water I decided to do some carping my first results where very mixed caught 6 snappers and 2 20â€ carp  on boilies I made ( work well for large snappers 1 @26 lbs and 1 @ 25 1/2 lbs) and  hair curlers for a method feeder .    Next outing was much better with no turtles and 4 fish and a bit larger same set up as before.    Finally made well the next time out with more fish going 4 for 7 and a bit larger fish  
91141,Bly,2007-07-05 20:19:00,1556,Well done!!     How big is the carp in the picture??  Glad to see that the time effort you have been putting into this is paying off
91147,Victor,2007-07-05 21:02:00,1609,nice catch! is that a PB snapper?
91160,BFSC Kevin,2007-07-05 21:50:00,1351,"maybe snapping turtles should be part of the tourney? lol currently we have a 25"" carp.. since i don't know anything about carping.. i'm hoping someone can pick up the slack for team 3.. let's see if you can beat cliff's 37"" carp.. YOU CAN DO IT!!  go team 3 go!"
91191,Crazyhook,2007-07-06 00:38:00,1154,man I caught one this year too...
91197,Guest Johnny Bass,2007-07-06 01:00:00,0,"I've caught many snappers.Snappers are powerful swimmers and can put up a decent fight if you catch them on a minnow, pike hook and bobber, but on a worm and hooked through the lip, they come straight up.  Sounds like the carp were biting. Though I dont think carp can compare to salt water fishing."
91218,ecxstriper,2007-07-06 02:39:00,343," the one pictured is only 24"" I sent in the 27"" to gerrit  Going striper fishing Saturday!!!"
91219,ecxstriper,2007-07-06 02:41:00,343, Yep pb on the snapper  thinking about starting  a  snapper guiding service
91222,ecxstriper,2007-07-06 02:44:00,343,this is the 25 1/2  pounder. He was a bit upset at being interupeted during dinner !!! 
91234,ccmtcanada,2007-07-06 03:00:00,7971,Congrats on the tourney entry ALEX!  I knew it was only a matter of time before you started to bring them in.  Now you gotta find a spot that hold lots of hungry big ones!!  Glad to hear your home made boilies are working out for you too.  Those snapping turtles look NASTY!!!
