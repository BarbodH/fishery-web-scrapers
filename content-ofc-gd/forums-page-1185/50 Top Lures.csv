91302,Tdel,2007-07-06 14:11:00,393,"Definite go to lures for me are:  1. Canadian Wiggler -Chrome 2. Daredevil - Red & White Spoon 3. Williams Wabler - Any colour 4. Rapala - Black & White or Blue & Silver 5. Walmart ""sale bin lure""  I have seen it in the bins constantly.  Don't know the name of this lure but man can it catch bass and pike in Georgian Bay.  No name on the lure at all.  Red angled from head to first set of triple hooks and silver the rest of the way to the end of the lure.  Lure has a loud rattle.  Approx 4.5 inches and looks like a Yo-Zuri Emperor Minnow. 6. Panther Martin - Pike size - Silver with Blue Feather.  (Not available now as far as I know) 7. Blue Foxee Jig - Crayfish colour 8. Little Cleo - Blue & Chrome 9. Jitter Bug - Original red & white 10. Hula Popper - Frog or Red & White colours 11. Flat Fish - Colour Skunk 12. Lucky Strike Red Flash Wiggler spoon 13. Worm Harness - Double / single blade or hook. 14. Mr. Champ Lure - with a pearl - Ice fishing. 15. Swedish Pimple - Original - with or without a pearl - Ice Fishing   Al's Goldfish was a lure that caught many Silver Bass in the old days.  I don't know if it was called Al's Goldfish then but it was called ""Goldfish"" and looked identical to Al's. You could get it in gold or silver if I remember correctly.  Tom  I have no idea why the Canadian Wiggler didn't make the list.  Just a great lure for almost anything."

90806,ccmtcanada,2007-07-04 20:23:00,7971,The good ole red devil at number 2!!!  Bly's go to lure!
90808,lew,2007-07-04 20:36:00,12767,"hmmmmm,  Suicks didn't  make the list ??  One of the best wooden musky baits ever and it still puts em in the boat....."
90811,Hookset,2007-07-04 20:51:00,367,"  Kinda makes ya wonder what they used as references as to the top 50 don't it ? Sales maybe ??? Sounds like a good topic for a poll here. I'm kinda curious what a Phoebe is. The Phoebe I know wouldn't make the list. She broke my heart in grade 4, I even gave her my last Twinkie. Heartless..............   Hookset."
90817,mepps,2007-07-04 21:23:00,1301,"What, Mepps aglia isnt number 1?!  Great list though!"
90820,keram,2007-07-04 21:32:00,585,"Now, this explains everything  . Just checked my three   50 lb boxes of lures, and among 500-600  different ones I could not find even one from""golden 55""   . I'm not surprised that a skunk is my best friend  Note to myself: First thing tomorrow  - arrange second mortgage  , then in the afternoon trip to CTC   Then on the weekend   I will talk to the skunk."
90856,Greencoachdog,2007-07-04 23:57:00,8163,"4 of my favorites are in there!  #20... the Roostertail!!!... when you see the pics of me at that concrete wall at the dam holding up those Spotted Bass, that's what I'm throwing!!!  #40... Teeny Torpedo!... is what I throw to the Stripers when they are feeding on Threadfin Shad on the surface... Pink Eyed Ghost is my favorite color pattern.  #46... Lunker Lure Buzzbait... I'll throw that dang thing 100 times to get 1 topwater hit, then throw another hundred  #47... Culprit Tassel Lizard... I rig it weightless and weedless and throw it into the salad for Largemouths!"
90871,solopaddler,2007-07-05 00:39:00,8605," It's more popular in the States, but trust me the Phoebe spoon has developed an underground cult following among trout fishermen here in Canada. If memory serves douG likes this lure too  . It's one of my favourite spoons for Brookies and Lakers along with the E.G.B."
90874,setomonkey,2007-07-05 00:42:00,872,"Some great classics on the list, and a bunch of them are in my tacklebox: grubs, daredevle spoon, Williams Wabler, Rapala, Mepps.  Haven't even heard of some of hte others though. Hmm, another trip to the tackle store may be in order...  Mike"

91196,Guest Johnny Bass,2007-07-06 00:54:00,0,"The gibbs pencil popper looks like fish head Rick's hunchback minnow!! Where is Rick anyways???The only one that I dont have but I want to get and told my friend to buy is the Mann's minus 1.  The Zara spook I bought and got snagged on reeds on my first cast. Never bought it again, though I definately will consider buying it one day. I just have too much tackle now to justify buying more lures!  I also definately agreee that the best all around lure is the curly tail grub and jig. I have caught everything that swims on it. I also had a 30+ lb Muskie follow a 4 inch chartreuse grub to the boat."
