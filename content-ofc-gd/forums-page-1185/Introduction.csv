91394,derekadam,2007-07-06 19:49:00,22,"Hello ladies and gents, i'd just like to introduce myself, i've enjoyed reading the posts and thought i'd join in. I'm 27, currently finishing up my Master's degree at McMaster University in Hamilton and have recently welcomed my first child into this world. I can't wait to take her fishing. I grew up in Windsor, did a little fishing as a child but have really become more serious about it in the last year. My brother has a boat back home so my most successful outings have been for Lake St. Clair bass. Closer to home i've tried for trout and/or salmon on the Grand, Credit and Niagara with no luck so far, but have been successful targeting smallmouth on the Grand and at local conservation areas.  Here are a couple pics to get me started. The first is a smallie from last week on St. Clair, the second a significantly smaller one from the Grand on Sunday, and the third a nice pic of the river from the same outing.  I look forward to posting my adventures and reading about all of yours.  d    "
