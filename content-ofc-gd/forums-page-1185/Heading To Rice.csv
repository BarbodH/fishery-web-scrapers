Anyone have luck on Rice Lake in heat of afternoon recently.....bass/eyes....what were you using? Thinking I'll try around the tracks, start with Senko's and then Rapalas....colours?  May not manage to 'get away', kids love to tube and its hard to say no to other children who happen to be on beach."
