91172,Guest Johnny Bass,2007-07-05 23:00:00,0,"I am getting it replaced. Does anyone want to buy a brand new BPS rod for $25?? Medium action, 7 foot, spinning rod. I wanna buy a Fenwick..."
91174,Big Cliff,2007-07-05 23:07:00,6899,"If you were in their boat, would you give someone a replacement? You don't mention how you broke it... your fault? or was it defective? I can't speak for BPS other than I have always been pleased with their service and support but I owned my own business for many years and I found that sometimes customers can expect the unreasonable. The phrase, ""the customer is always right!"" Doesn't mean that the customer is always fair or reasonable! Let your consciense be your guide!"
91180,silveradosheriff,2007-07-05 23:31:00,1025,Buy a St. Croix - they stand 100% behind their rods!
91189,Guest Johnny Bass,2007-07-06 00:30:00,0,"Cliff, the tip flew off, thats all I know.  St.croix is a little out of my price range, but I have had my eye on them for quite some time...  I testing a fenwick that is perfect for crankbaits at BPS."
91198,danc,2007-07-06 01:13:00,4677,Cabelas would replace it in an instant. No questions asked. That's why they're #1. I've dealt with both Bass Pro and Cabelas. Now I only deal with Cabelas.

Lebarons (where I bought it) referred me to the Quantum service centre and the guy said no problem, bring it in and they'd replace it (despite not having a receipt) . I'll find out this weekend if it's too good to be true.  You never know, some companies really go that extra mile for you..........others don't."
