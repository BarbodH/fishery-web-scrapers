91236,evster,2007-07-06 03:05:00,367,Went to Guelph Lake today with a friend from work.  He has fished there a couple times so I thought we would give it a try.  We spent most of the time moving from spot to spot to get an idea of what was there.  We were fishing from shore.  He caught a small perch right away on a worm.  I spent most of my time casting spoons and spinner baits for pike but no takers.  Once my baitcaster reel got nested up I switched over to my spinning reel with a 6 inch stik-o.  Fished it for a while with nothing until right before dark.  Nothing to brag about but it sure felt good to catch after 3 hours of nothing.
