91287,Jay T,2007-07-06 13:21:00,282,"Cook's is a good choice usually I always get on the perch, Bass, Pike. Eugenia is good for Bass, Perch I live in Eugenia I fish there all the time, fish all the weed lines and in the little openings in between should get into them Bass and Perch. I will be heading to Simcoe tomorrow for Lake Trout, Whities, Bass and Crappie, need a good fish fry it has been a while.   Go get em."
