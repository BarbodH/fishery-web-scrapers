91262,pikehunter,2007-07-06 09:19:00,1659,"Hello and good morning to everyone!  I really don't know why I'm up this early  Woke up about 2 hours ago and couldn't get back to sleep so I figured why not play a couple of games on the 'puter and drop into OFC.  I think it's going to warm back up again, we had about a week of really great weather with warm days and cool evenings, perfect!  But it sure looks like were going back into a humid warm cycle again.  Maybe I can make a couple of phone calls this morning and then if nothing is happening with my customer list I'll head out to fish too.  Good Day to everyone"
