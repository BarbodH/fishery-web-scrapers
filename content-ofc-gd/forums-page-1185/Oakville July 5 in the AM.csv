91104,icefisherman,2007-07-05 19:11:00,952,"Did very well today at Oakville. Steady action all morning. Started at 6am and left at Noon. A bit windy at times but fishing was the best so far for me at Oakville. Ended up 8 for 12. Not bad for 6 hours. Larges I got in the boat was 23Lbs. Bunch of smaller ones as well. Missed tow big ones - one about the same 20+ range and right when I was packing to go home one of the rods, the second one screamed big time....grabbed it but this fish was going for a run....peeled 380' of power pro line, jumped ....and got unhooked. Oh well it was blood pumping moment at the end of the fishing trip. Tried meat - nothing. All fish came on spoons in 80-150 fow. Down 30' on the rigger with slider and lead core line 6 colors out. Got the big one and 2 small ones on the lead core and the rest on the rigger. Most on the bottom lure. Watermelon, blue/white, purple and copper did the damage today. Seemed like all the bait has moved from 75-80 fow to 90-110 fow. This where most of my action was. May try again in the next few days. Here are few cell phone shoots I've managed today.       Cheers, Ice Fisherman"
