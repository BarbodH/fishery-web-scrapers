67124,BabyHerc,2007-05-02 20:08:00,285,"The trout fishery runs from Shand Dam (Belwood Lake) down to West Montrose.  Look at a map, find some bridges, and give 'er a go.  Pay attention to special regulations areas: no live bait, single barbless hooks, and catch-and-release only.  No 20-inch-browns-on-a-cooler pics"

91100,douG,2007-07-05 18:48:00,2693,"The RLG and I took a drive along the Grand on Monday from the 401, and that was exactly where they were fishing, in the water."
91105,danbouck,2007-07-05 19:14:00,4380,There's no trout in the grand
91188,carp-starter,2007-07-06 00:27:00,253,"I must correct BabyHerc's post a bit about the special regulations within the 3 sections on the Grand that have special regulations.  ""Pay attention to special regulations areas: no live bait, single barbless hooks, and catch-and-release only. No 20-inch-browns-on-a-cooler pics"".   The special regulations are: - artificial lures only - dead bait is also not allowed - this means - no organic bait - single barbless hooks only - possession of brook, brown or rainbow trout is zero (0)  carp-starter - good luck in hunting for trout - every spot on the water can turn out to be a ""hot spot""."
