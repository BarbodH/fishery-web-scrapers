When I looked over my sholder and saw a bald eagle flying not 30 feet from me carrying a fish in its talons.  Man those things are beautiful!  Didnt have time to get a picture as it was on its way to eat its dinner but I thought I would share.  That is the first time I have seen one that close in the wild, only other ones I saw were through binoculars 100's of yards away.  So if you are in the longpoint area, keep a look out maybe there are more."
