91266,Roy,2007-07-06 10:39:00,13728,I kinda like Pete Frampton. That wasn't one of his best album covers though.

91313,Pete Maina,2007-07-06 14:57:00,213,"You wouldn't have to worry about a gene pool. No woman in their right mind would be with a guy wearing a skirt.  I believe ladies think the pink hat is sexy though.  You're just jealous Thorpe ... you want a pink hat - and you know you do.  If you're nice, I'll bring along one of Brian's new CD's (just released) and a pink hat for you."
