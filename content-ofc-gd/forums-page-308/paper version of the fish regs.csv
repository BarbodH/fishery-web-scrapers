786539,kickingfrog,2013-05-14 16:37:00,8333,The MNR will be delivering a second batch of regs. Get em quick.
786549,gburdzin,2013-05-14 18:03:00,32,Any suggestions as to where one could pick up a copy in Mississauga/Etobicoke area?
786556,kickingfrog,2013-05-14 18:39:00,8333,Same places that you would normally??? Unless they are only sending them out to outletts that requested more??? The release I read only said that they would be shipped out at the end of the week.
786581,gburdzin,2013-05-14 20:21:00,32,Ok thanks...will check the usual places when I get a chance.
786619,FloatnFly,2013-05-14 23:29:00,1640,"could always you know, print them off"
786705,gburdzin,2013-05-15 12:02:00,32," Sure, but at 104 pages, I'd rather pick up a printed copy for keeping in the boat."
786710,woodenboater,2013-05-15 12:29:00,2277,"A mobile app would really be a smart idea. If I can find an LCBO or Timmy's on my mobile, shirley I should be able to get info on zones and slots."
