Neither of us has ever fished the area and this will be the first weekend that we will have a boat up there.   I am in driving distance of the Ottawa River, the St Lawrence and a bunch of lakes within an hour or two. Can anyone give me an idea where to start looking for walleye?"
786935,mike rousseau,2013-05-16 06:36:00,4661,St Lawrence....  I boated 80 walleye last week... They are still concentrated in post spawn....  Shoot me a PM if you want some more info...
786937,fishindevil,2013-05-16 08:13:00,6254,If you are going to fish the Ottawa river FMZ 12 remember there is a slot size in effect till June 15th but there is a ton of lakes in the area just to the west and the ridaue river and calabogie and the madawaska river just to the north and there is lots of pike in the Ottawa river too so you have lots of options call paddle tails bait shop in Ottawa and they will give you the info for sure !!!!! Great area up there and the fishing is always great !!!! Oh ya crappies are all around the area too !!!!! Good luck hope this helps a bit

I'll likely catch my own but some options would be nice.  Thanks for the tips guys, keep ‘em coming I’m getting pumped for this weekend!!"
