787117,Locnar,2013-05-16 23:56:00,645,"Hello folks, I'm interested in purchasing a cheap 10 or 12 ft aluminum boat... I have a motor for it already, so that part is outta the way. Any ideas of where to look? I've been perusing kijiji, but there isn't a lot there. Anyone know of any local marinas who'd sell used ones? Any information is appreciated."
787118,Locnar,2013-05-16 23:57:00,645,"I am in Whitby... just to clarify what ""local"" means."
787120,fishindevil,2013-05-17 00:02:00,6254,"Well I guess it depends how much ""cheap"" you want to spend,small tinnies are always in demand for cottagers and camps and stuff so give us a price ?? I live in cottage country and see a fair amount of them for sale seems like they are around $500 is that about your price range??"
787126,Locnar,2013-05-17 00:36:00,645,"Oops, forgot to mention a price... anywhere from $400-$700 I am willing to spend."
