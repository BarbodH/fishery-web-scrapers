787445,super dave,2013-05-20 02:05:00,323,"Not Kong ago I put up a post on installing a 7 pin wiring system to tow a travel trailer and installing a brake controller.  It WS a lot more complicated than I thought so I paid a mechanic to install.  Upon inspection, I noticed he used my existing wires from my 4 pin and installed only one more wire and used the wrong plug.  He still used a 7 pin plug but round not flat for the pins.  I know nothing about the wiring.   Can only 5 wires be used to have everything functional?   Is, brake lights, turn signal, brake controller....   or did I get hosed!?"
787448,DRIFTER_016,2013-05-20 02:10:00,10439,"Yes, you really only need 5 of the 7 wires. The other two are reserved for power to give voltage to charge an on board battery on the trailer."
787449,Fisherman,2013-05-20 02:29:00,7201,"Go to Princess Auto or CTC and get the 7 pin flat blade connector for the vehicle end.  Use the same 5 wires he did,  the other 2 are for trailer power from the tow vehicle and reverse lights, neither are really needed."
787459,super dave,2013-05-20 11:28:00,323,I have the flat 7 pin plug.  I tried connecting by colour code and it didn't work.  Would anyone know which how I should connect each wire?  The new wire I'm assuming is for the brake controller.   Is that the middle? Thanks in advance for replies.  I would love to get this resolved by today.

787663,super dave,2013-05-21 11:36:00,323,Thanks dave.   It worked.  I tried another Google diagram before but must have been a diff 7 pin?  Not sure.
