787151,outdoordude,2013-05-17 05:06:00,15,hello wondering if anyone knows what is a good salmon and steelhead casting rod for floating and throwing lures that is at a descent price. I am just getting in to baitcasters and what not just looking for some good recommendations  thanks
787157,Rod Caster,2013-05-17 11:19:00,5784,Check this thread out  http://ontariofishingcommunity.com/forums/index.php?showtopic=69050&hl=%2Bsteelhead+%2Brod  I ended up buying a SHimano Convergence for around $98 at CT. I like it!
787163,jammer,2013-05-17 12:32:00,43,I've been using Streamside rods for the last quite a few years...  Guaranteed for life and i believe there not much more then $100...  Available at Angling Outfitters in Woodstock...
787169,Ainsley,2013-05-17 13:44:00,142,"I have a st. Croix wild river 9'6"" casting for bottom bouncing and throwing hardware and a quantum cold water 10'6"" for floating.  The st. Croix is too fast for floating but they may have other models that are a more moderate action to suit both. I'd also choose an avid over the wild river if you can find one in sale."

787253,Ainsley,2013-05-17 23:13:00,142,That's pretty good. What reel are you planning on using with it?
