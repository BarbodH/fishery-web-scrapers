787568,woodenboater,2013-05-20 21:49:00,2277," It worked in this instance but it could have gone wrong in so many ways you don't want to think about it. Why even try to provoke someone ? What if he really flew off the handle and you ended up on the wrong side of a beat down ?  As well as the 'grin and bear it' there's also the 'count to ten and take same number of deep breaths' that I do my best to follow when confronted with idiots.  and remember, only the legal system can determine right or wrong."
787572,Rich,2013-05-20 22:04:00,3927,"Bah. Too far off topic, sorry for the derail."
787573,FloatnFly,2013-05-20 22:08:00,1640,"  thats what managers are there for, they removed the problem from the store, if it persists, then the police are called in.  the guy could have easily had a knife or gun with him.  if its one thing i've learned, never under estimate anyone"

787575,Rich,2013-05-20 22:15:00,3927,"It's a long , long story, subtracting from a simple point. Just treat customer service reps with a little respect, just a LITTLE. Paid or not, we're all people. Nobody deserves that level of disrespect. I'm not chasing people home with a bat cuz they didn't say thank you, no worries. The management thing well, long story. It could have went a million ways. But it was , what it was.  They are not ALL stupid. They don't all hate you. They aren't all lazy. A lot of us are glad to help.  Just a little respect, thats all. Lol Sorry everyone took my sentence out of context, albeit misleadingly printed in retrospect.  Many of my friends in retail agree.. some people come in to these places just to feel like they are royalty for a few hours. That's fine. Just don't disrespect the butler."
787583,sofabed,2013-05-20 23:10:00,119,BP credited me my gas and 407 cost on a new trolling motor because I was quoted on something which was not correct on the phone. There was no fuss the sales person realized their mistake and called the manager who offered me the discount. They did this all on their own. I didn't even ask.

787643,crappieperchhunter,2013-05-21 03:20:00,2582,I bought an 8 inch lazer ice auger from BPS in the fall of 2010. I have a  5 inch lazer than I LOVE and have had zero issues with...anyway I literally cut 3 holes with it in Feb 2011 and found it to be just plain more work then I wanted to do. I drove from Oshawa to BPS in the spring of 2011 and tried to get a refund on this auger which I admit I had lost the receipt for...but I had the box with the BPS address on IT that the auger came in!!! Anyway long story short. I will never EVER spent another dime in that store again.  Glad you had a good experience Brian....but they will never get another cent of my hard earned money.
787645,BillM,2013-05-21 03:22:00,17367," You wanted a refund on an item with no receipt and just the box 6 months after you purchased it?  LOL, these are the kind of stories the sales people talk about at the end of the day."
787648,crappieperchhunter,2013-05-21 03:40:00,2582,I understand all that Bill. I actually found the receipt later. It had fallen behind my dresser. The auger was mint...I had only cut 3 holes with it and I had the box it came in with BPS Vaughn's address on it. I understand they where under no obligation to help me out. I also understand that I treated the salesman with respect and he would NOT do ANYTHING to help me out. There was lots of opportunity for them to be helpful and retain/obtain a customer and they did NOT. There loss not mine.
787652,Rich,2013-05-21 09:38:00,3927,"That's your opinion. Some of us have jobs that are about 10% customer service and 90% actual work, I'm a butcher , not your butler. I have the right to not look at a soul who walks by, asks questions, rings bells. So if I am nice enough to leave my block to help you out, be nice, or I'll turn around and start cutting again.  The things the dumbass consumers don't think about."
787666,BillM,2013-05-21 11:58:00,17367," You seem angry, perhaps you need to seek some professional help."
787679,FloatnFly,2013-05-21 12:50:00,1640,"  Im a butcher as well, you obviously work in a chain store, since thats the kind of attitude i would expect from one.  If I ever came into your work and thats the attitude you gave, I would put in a complaint to the store manager daily. You are lucky I don't know where you work, otherwise I'd be sending him to this forum, you are the type of person I would never want working for me.  and you wonder why companies want to look at your facebook page before deciding if they're even going to give you an interview.....this guy is why.  without customers, you have no job, YOU should be kissing THEIR feet"
787682,lew,2013-05-21 13:05:00,12766,"As for BPS, I've only been there 6 or 8 times and not at all for a couple years now, but I've always had good experiences and never had a problem with any of the staff. I normally know what I'm looking for and don't really need anyones help, but it's always been good."
787684,Terry,2013-05-21 13:24:00,14456,"oh yeah, BPS. The thread has  been so butchered I forgot what we were talking about............  lol"
787685,woodenboater,2013-05-21 13:27:00,2277,"Best department at BPS Vaughan are the fly guys. The other fishing departments are hit and miss, some do try though, others, not so much. I am glad we have lots of shopping options in southern Ont. for fishing gear."
787686,Roy,2013-05-21 13:30:00,13728,Well the thread started off good. Thanks everyone.
787687,FloatnFly,2013-05-21 13:30:00,1640,"even the fly department is hit and miss especially if you get the old skinny with the mustache, and their selection of flies is kind of lack luster"
695852,misfish,2012-05-13 16:49:00,29133,"The Vaughan store seems to get a bad wrap 99% of the time here. Well today I can say I was treated with nothing but respect and politness. I posted awhile back about a leak in my waders. I called during the week about getting them replaced.I was told no problem. Just bring your receipt and the waders. So today I go down there for opening. Go to the counter and am greeted with,good morning,how can I help you. Explained what the issue was.Handed over the receipt and was told to go and get another pair no problem. When I arrive at the section,I am greeted again with,good morning,how can I help you. Explained to the girl,I was here to get a replacement set of waders.No problem sir,what kind were they.After telling her,she said they had a new shipment come in,and they were not the same,but were an upgrade. Opening the box,I could see right away they were a better made wader.And here,s the kicker,they were 35 bucks cheaper then the ones I bought.I was told I would get a 35 dollar in store credit. SWEET.  So once that was all taken care of,I head to the fly shop. They have a fly rod and reel on sale for $39.99. Cheap enough outfit to get started. Turns out they didnt get them in yet,but was handed a slip to fill out,and when they arrive,they will hold one for me. I got to talking with the guy in the shop. I learned alot from him. Cheap lines compared to higher priced lines. How the line should lay on the water. Then,I started asking about flys. I seen flies,that there was no way I could tie a knot to.    Then I see these magnifier speck.Perfect. I grab a pair. I thanked the fella for all his help and headed off.  Remember that in store credit,well there was a nice selection of micro kwikfish on sale for 2:99.I stocked up.   So this is just to say,I was pleased with how I was treated today.  Sometimes,it all starts with the way the customer approaches their staff.   Thought I would just share that not everyone has bad dealing with them.   Now to get mothers day supper prept."
695881,fishboy,2012-05-13 18:45:00,550,"I've had great treatment there as well.  Had the side plate come off a few-month old BPS baitcaster and fall into the drink.  Called the store from Haliburton (home is in Hamilton where the receipt was) and they said no problem, bring it in on the way home and we'll replace it by looking up the transaction through the credit card record. When I went into the store, the clerk at the service desk looked up the transaction, called a guy at the fishing counter, asked me what pound test and he brought a new reel to the service desk, spooled with line."

696032,backbay,2012-05-14 01:50:00,773,"If it wasn't there, most of us would probably miss it. They don't always have the specific size or colour of lure I want, but I've always wondered how you could stock every SKU from each manufacturer. The staff, when I deal with them, have always helped me out. I really don't have any complaints about the place, and because it's on the way north for me, it can always be a fun start to a fishing weekend"
787430,Default User,2013-05-19 23:35:00,72,I find they are awesome when my kids (6yo and 6mo) are with me.  But ignore me when I'm alone
787432,Terry,2013-05-19 23:54:00,14456,good you got the new ones  and it's always good to hear about good service

787454,FloatnFly,2013-05-20 03:43:00,1640,"i have yet to have good customer service experience at BP, nothing compared to sail anyway  as for the size of the fly, looks like a #12 hook size?  i know some people will use a #34 dry fly"
787461,Rich,2013-05-20 11:40:00,3927,"""How the customer treats the staff"" ...  As a worker in retail, all I can say is thank you for pointing that out. Often the store of the employee gets the bad rep.. but how far out of your way would you go to help a lost cause inconsiderate person with no manners or respect whatsoever? Probably not far, for minimum wage.  Remember those people are simply earning a paycheck, and not much of one, so their abuse tolerance is likely limited.  I've followed rude customers home at the end of a shift and put fear in them.  Anyway, thank you misfish!  I've personally always had good experiences with BPS too. The staff is always helpful and ready. Unless it's a really busy time, which obviously just means that well, its busy.  I think 90% of people think they are the most important people in the world and just dont understand we get paid the same to serve jimmy a donut as you a bass boat... Figuratively."
787485,mbac31,2013-05-20 14:46:00,904,"You have followed people home and put fear in them. what the hell. Am I the only one who sees this as a problem. You my friend have worse issues than the rude customer. That turns a rude customer into a chargeable offense my friend. No matter if the customer is rude or not it does not give you the right to stalk and intimidate anyone, retail or not. If you worked for me your ass would get fired from just this post alone."
787487,woodenboater,2013-05-20 14:55:00,2277,"People who get into service industries like retail have to understand that the job is not always sunshine, ponies and rainbows. Perhaps the customer is having a craptastic day as well and doesn't need attitude from holier than thou retail staff. I used to work retail and restaurants and followed the 'grin and bear it' motto when dealing with customers who were less than nice or polite. Repeat business is the goal and having happy customers ensures that 100%.  Overall I've had good experiences at BPS but have encountered staff who I felt thought were above me and even deigned to assist me. No idea why. I'd go back there since they have items no one else has"
787493,lew,2013-05-20 15:55:00,12766," If one of these ""rude customers"" decides he doesn't like the idea of you following him on his way home  with the intent  of  putting fear into him  and turns around and smashes you in the face, what would your response be to that ??"
787497,Christopheraaron,2013-05-20 16:17:00,3525," I'd say that looks more like a #14, the smallest I've tried is #24, but the nice thing about small hooks is the patterns only get simpler"
787498,Pigeontroller,2013-05-20 16:24:00,2793," Pretty sure there's laws against this...Or like Lew said, following someone home and 'scaring' them can quickly turn on you..."

Sure its nice that the customer treats you well, but they don't have to.  They are there for a certain product, and if after walking around for 5-10 minutes and not seeing any staff to help them, it gets irritating.  just always remember, without the customers, there is no paycheck.  The last 2 times in BP, I was getting a pair of wading boots, had to walk around the shoe department for 10 minutes before someone finally came out of the back room.  the other, was looking for a new spinning reel, guy behind the counter came over, told him i was looking for a new reel and was trying to decide between a couple different ones, he just kinda gave a hrmph and went over to someone  else"

787553,Rich,2013-05-20 21:00:00,3927,"First off, the dude I'm talking about had literally researched some kid in seafood for two weeks , before coming in and insulting him top to bottom, to tears, because they were sold out of steelhead. He then threatened to wait until the kid went home. The management could only ask him to leave, store policy. So I followed him out of the building and made sure he went home. When he got there I was HOPING that would be the stupid idiot's reaction, so I could get his firey stupid bum in jail. It failed, he was a pansy."
787555,Rich,2013-05-20 21:02:00,3927,"And, he never ever looked at the kid in seafood again. So throw your morals and laws all you want. But it worked. I know how to take care of myself against an old man in a fight way better than an 18 yr old kid."
