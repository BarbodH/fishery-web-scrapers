787554,Raycaster,2013-05-20 21:00:00,528,I have a Portable Humminbird 160 that I want to permanently mount on my used 16' pontoon.  I have no problem mounting it but wondering about the power supply.  The fish finder battery I have lasts for days without needing recharging so hoping I can simply add to the accessory panel (separate switch and fuse).  I have an older 30hp Yamaha that I assume recharges the battery when running so would the fishfinder be a huge drain and require another battery?  I could just put the fishfinder battery in the console and use if needed...    Almost there...

It will take for ever to drain your boats battery even if your motor didn't charge it. I used to use a group 24 battery to run my big Lowrance depth finder up at the lodge and I would only recharge the battery (our motors didn't have electric start or charging capabilities) every 2nd or 3rd week.
