785445,bow slayer,2013-05-09 14:14:00,1074,"dont get me wrong I am not saying buy it here....that is the best price I have been able to find in ontario,most places in the states it is around the 1000 mark. I am looking to buy a 1000w for camping and i will be traveling to Port Huron if i can not find a used one before then."
785477,Shloim,2013-05-09 17:37:00,515,I've had a Honda 3500 for 15 years  couldn't be happier. It starts after a couple pulls  every time
787221,woodenboater,2013-05-17 17:54:00,2277,"Just an update on the generator.  There were several on Kijiji I missed out on (one for $850 in Barrie !) but finally grabbed a used (barely) Honda 2000i today. Damn this is one quiet generator, I can see why they're popular. Looking forward to using it next weekend when SWMBO and I open up the cabin.  Thanks to everyone for their input, helped tremendously and glad I was steered away from Champions  and I hope all OFC'ers have a great long weekend on the water ! wanna see reports with major fish porn lol"
787231,TJQ,2013-05-17 20:32:00,7806,"I love my honda 2000 and pretty much run it 24/7 when im at camp.. i use syntheic oil and its never ever let me down.  If it ever dies, i would replace it with the exact same thing."
787232,TJQ,2013-05-17 20:33:00,7806,"PLUS!!  if I ever get the urge to get a new one.. or you have buddy with one, you can turn two into a 4000"
785023,woodenboater,2013-05-07 23:35:00,2277,"Looking to mine the collected wisdom of the OFC community.  I'm looking to get a portable generator and have a few ideas in mind. Needs to be around 60 lbs or under, gasoline and relatively quiet. 2000 watts is probably fine for most needs (might need to power a 5000 btu window a/c unit but not often. This will be schlepped up and back and not left behind at the cabin.  Top of the list if I have the money is the Honda EU2000KC2. Yamahas seem to be as popular as the Hondas but maybe more $$.  Also see Champions are better priced and reviews look good for the 2000w inverter generator.  Is there another brand I'm missing that's reliable and quiet and doesn't cost too much or is it what I'm looking for going to hurt the pocketbook ?   tia,  WB"
785035,Old Man,2013-05-08 00:06:00,822,"You want quiet, go with the Honda."
785051,Gerry,2013-05-08 00:37:00,257,"The quietest would be the Honda, the Yamaha a close 2nd. The Champion is cheaper but way, way louder. A noisy generator is extremely annoying. I own 2 Honda's, the 2000 watts and a 3800 watts. I would want to check closely to see that the 2000 will power your A/C."
785077,Fisherman,2013-05-08 01:36:00,7201,"Honda, hands down and it should have no problem running a 5K A/C."
785087,woodenboater,2013-05-08 02:14:00,2277,well I guess the consensus is go Honda. thanks to everyone for making my wallet that much lighter  Guess I hafta decide new or used.  thanks again all !
785091,bigbuck,2013-05-08 02:22:00,2449,"If you plan on running an a/c unit, fridge, etc.... Look at something a bit larger. 3000 watts should do the job comfortably. It wont be running at full power constantly, the 2000 will be near capacity. Price is higher but you will only buy it once."
785103,atvaholic,2013-05-08 02:58:00,271,"I have a hyundai 1000 watt generator(they also Make larger) from Wal mart for well over a year. It's an ""inverter"" type generator which means it does not need to run at super high RPM to produce ""clean"" power and hence is quieter.  Not as reliable as a honda but I got it on clearance for 1/4 the price. It is very quiet and works for me."
785114,bucktail,2013-05-08 04:00:00,1857,champions are pure garbage. I own a 2000 watt Yamaha and it runs flawless.
785117,fishindevil,2013-05-08 07:42:00,6254,I have a 3500/4000 Hyundai generator I got at Walmart for $400 on sale and it's powerful and runs pretty quiet I was suprised and it can also run 220v as well and has a fairly decent sized gas tank too but those new smaller Yamaha gens are sure quiet I have heard and seen them run and they are sweet !!!! Good luck whatever you get
785165,bow slayer,2013-05-08 14:12:00,1074,check out kijiji there was a place i believe in Markham that was selling refurb hyundai inverter generators 2000 w for 230 bucks plus tax with a warranty. Not a honda or yamaha but for that price hard not to look.
785245,Tomcat,2013-05-08 19:42:00,395,"Unless you have access to a new 2013 Honda generator for a kick-but price, check out Kijiji and save dollars for slightly used Honda portable generators. Last year, I purchased a mint 2010 Honda EU2000i inverter generator with less than 12 hours running time for $950. No regrets whatsoever."
785282,pidge,2013-05-08 21:58:00,438,"We beat on Honda 2000's at work and I'm shocked the abuse these little guys can take. I've driven 300km in the rain with them and at the end one pull and they start as if they were dry. If I were to buy one that was small, portable, and light it'd be a Honda 2000. As for the A/C thing thats something your gonna have to look into. Not so sure if they can handle that draw or not."
785299,Fisherman,2013-05-08 22:47:00,7201,"Another thought, if you know anyone going south across the border or can get there yuorself,  the Honda EU2000 goes for around $900 + or - a bit.  Just about half of waht you pay up here."
785301,Tomcat,2013-05-08 22:49:00,395,"Based on a little research via the net, it looks like a 3000 watt generator is required to start and run a typical 13500 BTU air conditioner in an RV."
785306,davey buoy,2013-05-08 23:00:00,5505,"Air conditioners?,I thought a generator was mostlly meant for a fridge or freezer staying cold during a power outage?,and of course the leafs in the playoffs!  ."
785313,woodenboater,2013-05-08 23:26:00,2277,"If the Leafs go all the way, will definitely need backup power for those warm June nights lol. They need to rattle Chara off his game, and Jagr, and Rask...  Good start for the Buds, just need to control those stupid turnovers which killed them Monday."
785338,Fisherman,2013-05-09 00:34:00,7201,"Even if gas was 10 cents a litre, it would never be used to run a generator to watch huckey."
785341,BillM,2013-05-09 00:49:00,17367," Been looking at this unit, can't believe the price difference up here..  It's not even close, lol"
785351,DRIFTER_016,2013-05-09 01:24:00,10439,Even in Alaska they're only $1050. I plan on getting one also. Need a better genny for my camper and hopefully for building my cabin. The cheap offshore one that sounds like someone shaking a 45 gallon drum 1/2 full of ball bearings is getting annoying.
785357,BillM,2013-05-09 01:31:00,17367,"Yeah, I basically use it to charge the trolling motor batteries in the boat (or run the AC on the camper if it's really hot)  Don't need to hear that when you're drinking beers around the camp fire"
785358,DRIFTER_016,2013-05-09 01:36:00,10439,Works good fer the coffee bean grinder and espresso machine.
785395,bow slayer,2013-05-09 04:01:00,1074,"well the best price I could find up here on a new honda 2000w inverter generator was this one,the place is in gta   http://ontario.kijiji.ca/c-buy-and-sell-home-outdoor-outdoor-tools-storage-HONDA-GENERATOR-NEW-EU2000KC2-W0QQAdIdZ344905549QQfeaturedAdZtrue"
785405,Gerry,2013-05-09 10:43:00,257,"Bowslayer,  Like someone mentioned, the price in the US is $900. That's where I got mine and what I paid. The $75 prep charge in the ad that you mention is a joke. All they do is unpack it, put oil and a bit of fuel in it. It might be worth the drive if you're saving $536.75 ($475 + 13%)."
785417,Fisherman,2013-05-09 12:07:00,7201,"Why the $1299,  call it $1300 for the extra dollar + the $75 prep + the tax on all that.  Drive south for the day and save."
785424,BillM,2013-05-09 12:40:00,17367,LOL @ $75 prep charge.
