786975,Tootsie II,2013-05-16 13:20:00,162,"Can any of you knowledgeable guns owners confirm something for me.  In Ontario, if I was keeping an old pump shotgun in camp to ""protect"" against predatory wildlife (eg: black bears) and I was not hunting with that gun, can I remove the wood plug in the magazine so that it will hold 4 shells instead of only 2. And, no I don't leave it lying around without a trigger lock on it or with shells in either the chamber or mag. I've learned to unlock and load damned quick if I have to."
786977,BillM,2013-05-16 13:28:00,17367,"Yup, shouldn't be an issue.  If you are hunting, you are restricted to 3."
786988,Ron,2013-05-16 14:07:00,1683,no problem at all. So long as you  are not hunting with the shot gun.
786990,NAW,2013-05-16 14:13:00,4022,"My 870 can hold 7...  And it was bought that way from BPS, and did not even come with a plug to make it legal in Ontario.  When using it hunting, I remove the extended mag, put a normal one on, with a plug.  Not 100% sure of the legalities when not hunting.."
786995,jedimaster,2013-05-16 14:26:00,3472,"Just remember that you will need to explain it to a Co that you are not using it for hunting. Legal yes, but a conversation I wouldn't want to have. I plug all my shotguns and forget about it."
787004,bobogo,2013-05-16 15:24:00,76,"yup, that legal as long as you're not roaming the woods."
787027,Ryan Landry,2013-05-16 16:47:00,128,there is no mag capacity restriction for a pump shotgun. You're fine!
787042,Sinker,2013-05-16 17:54:00,8692,"Yep,  giver. I take the plug out of mine any time I'm not hunting.  S."
787045,wallyboss,2013-05-16 18:08:00,1095, Pretty sure there is !!!!  one in the barrel and two in the magazine.  When hunting!!!
787054,jedimaster,2013-05-16 18:54:00,3472,Correct shotguns can only hold a max of 3 shells when hunting including the chambered round. Pump or semi doesn't matter. That us one of the many laws that really bothers me. When deer hunting you can have a 10 round lever gun but only a 3 round shotgun. So dumb.
787061,Bill Shearer,2013-05-16 19:52:00,456,"Remington 870 and 1100, only held 5. Winchester Model 12 and 97 held 7. Could have lots of fun with a handful of well thrown clay targets and a good shooter. Anybody remember the old Winchester Pro Shooter films at the Sportsmen Show, back in the day? The guy could throw 7 clay targets BY HIMSELF, and then hit every one before they hit the dirt. Very cool."
787066,jedimaster,2013-05-16 20:05:00,3472,1892 holds 15 rounds.
