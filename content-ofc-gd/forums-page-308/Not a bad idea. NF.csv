786794,Christopheraaron,2013-05-15 20:50:00,3525,"cool, too bad it never took off."
786826,aplumma,2013-05-15 23:00:00,6896,The 1600 CC volkswagen was rated between 40 and 50 H.P. stock and runs without a load around 210 F and starts to destruct at 235 F. Air cooled as they are I would see this thing sending a lot of them to the garage with a blown motors and drivetrain issues. However it is cool to see that someone has do this.   Art
786869,Dave Bailey,2013-05-16 01:11:00,1641," I was thinking along similar lines, and the addition of the trailer may have also altered the airflow around the rear resulting in less cooling, but I can't say for sure. But the way the commentator was talking it sounded to me as if this wasn't exclusive to VWs, but perhaps intended as a conversion for other vehicles too."

786940,Terry,2013-05-16 09:09:00,14456,yeah not a chance.......and a tow hitch on the roof..safe  be like putting one on a plastic bumper
786946,NAW,2013-05-16 10:37:00,4022,"I can clearly see why it didn't take off.  Even if that trailer was made out of the lightest composites of the time, once loaded with camping gear and the family for a weeks vacation....  No way that bug would be able to stop for red lights...  The concept if very cool though."
787055,SirCranksalot,2013-05-16 19:00:00,3291,I doubt the roof would be strong enough to withstand the loads. One big bump and the roof caves in on the passengers. I wonder if it had to pass any safety stds at the time?
