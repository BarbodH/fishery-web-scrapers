Rice lake is always my favourite for walleye, tried it yesterday with some success, but unfortunately no pike in rice lake. not asking for any hotspots but if you know any lakes that have both pike and walleye in them, it would be greatly appreciated if you shared.  thanks Peter"

786856,Christopheraaron,2013-05-16 00:34:00,3525,"Dalrymple has them, I know the pike population is strong but I'm not sure how good it is for the eyes."
786872,Rich,2013-05-16 01:13:00,3927,"Sparrow Lake has both I believe, might be worth checking out."
786930,nlpaintballer,2013-05-16 03:47:00,122,"Balsam and Mitchell, check the exceptions about walleye for the lakes because the slot is different from the rest of zone 17."
786961,bobogo,2013-05-16 12:41:00,76,I think balsam lake has more muskie than pike as I was told from a friend to fishes there often.
786963,Fish4Eyes,2013-05-16 12:42:00,1022,Callandar Bay on Lake Nipissing.
786997,tb4me,2013-05-16 14:30:00,3295,Trent river just downstream of rice. Lake Seymour  crowe bay anywhere down there is loaded with good pike and walleye numbers
787001,jedimaster,2013-05-16 15:08:00,3472,Muskoka would be my bet if you want pike and walleye. Only problem is walleye you need to go with someone that knows the lake to find em or put in lots of hours.  Not really different than any other walleye lake though I guess.

787122,sofabed,2013-05-17 00:12:00,119,Balsam lake is full of Pike now. The walleye population is good as well.
787125,nlpaintballer,2013-05-17 00:33:00,122,"They just held a pike tourney on Balsam. Big fish was a tie at 34.5"" between 2 anglers. lot's of pike caught, I almost always limit out on pike so I'm pretty sure your odds are on to catch pike and not muskie.  The past couple years I have pulled well over 200 pike from Mitchell/Balsam and have only caught  around 20 muskie/tigers over the same time period. And 6 walleye.........guess what I don't fish for."
787142,bow slayer,2013-05-17 03:01:00,1074,"heres is a suggestion....a little more than 2 ,probably just over 3  but lake St.Clair,lots of pike and lots of walleye"
