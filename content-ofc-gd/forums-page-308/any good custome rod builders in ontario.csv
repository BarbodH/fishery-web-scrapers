786500,wkimwes,2013-05-14 13:44:00,76,Where is he located?  and how much were the work of arts he made for you?
786501,wkimwes,2013-05-14 13:45:00,76,"This is a great topic, I have found a guy locally...but I haven't pulled the trigger as I have no experience in venturing into the custom rod building.  The guy claims he can make an amazing punching rig for 200 bucks.  He just can't give me details on what ""amazing"" is."
786502,Christopheraaron,2013-05-14 13:47:00,3525,"It's your rod, if he isn't willing to show you his work I'd pass on him"
786535,wkimwes,2013-05-14 16:20:00,76,"Yeah, it seems odd he can't tell me specifics..etc.  I have stopped dealing with him."
786541,mercman,2013-05-14 16:58:00,7054,"Yup Spiel is the man. I have only drooled over pics of his work, but i had a chance to see Roys Spiel creations, and they are works of art to sat the least.  Paul"
787152,outdoordude,2013-05-17 05:07:00,15,is they any others
787189,porkpie,2013-05-17 14:30:00,2521,"I have noticed you edited out your original post removing your name, which was Ethan.  Coincidentally I happened to take a look at the floatfishing net rod building page yesterday, and there was a warning about a guy named Ethan screwing Spiel on a rod deal.  Coincidence?  Given those interesting circumstances I don't think I'd recommend anyone to you!"
787192,outdoordude,2013-05-17 14:45:00,15,That does not mean that itWas not me
787196,MJL,2013-05-17 15:05:00,2427," Ethan, there are a lot of guys on OFC who peruse the float board as well…  The threads on custom rod builders, baitcasters for steelhead, and the horrible application of the English language (on both message forums) really gives it away…Just saying…  Keep in mind that honesty is always the best policy"
787199,ColdH20guy,2013-05-17 15:30:00,312,"My neighbour is also a certified custom rod builders by the 'Guild'..has been for years..was just over there today and his 'fishing rod room' is amazing! We live in Coldwater ( near Orillia-Midland) and anyone that needs/wants a rod built or rod/reel fixed up, shoot me a message for his info or I can post it here? cheers Rich"
787205,outdoordude,2013-05-17 15:49:00,15, Does not mean he as to be an ass about it just drop it I did nothing wrong
787233,aplumma,2013-05-17 20:35:00,6896,Funny in 38 years you are the first person I have hear Spiel refuse a build too. Just saying.... BTW I own 5 of his masterpieces and am not only proud of them but have been offered more than twice what I paid. Value grows on quality products.    Art
787235,outdoordude,2013-05-17 21:03:00,15,No dout there nice but he order the stuff and I did not tell I'm to order it so.  I told him I was looking for something closer to me.
787237,misfish,2013-05-17 21:27:00,29133,"When I finally made up my mind to have Spiel do my first custom by him,I drove down to him and talked in person. It also helped that there was another guy there that has had many built by him.   When all the talk was done,I dropped  my deposit in his hand(which I was told was not really needed,but thats the way I roll) and I couldnt wait til it was done and in my hands. It was more then what I wanted to spend,but the REPUTATION,had me.  Bottom line,   I have a float rod that will be with me for life and no regrets,putting out the dow for a master piece.  Now Im working on another master piece. Spinndoc,s .CP"
787239,irishfield,2013-05-17 21:34:00,26272,"I just can't believe someone joined the board for this...  Spiel... can't say enough good about the guy, workmanship or heart."
787240,outdoordude,2013-05-17 21:40:00,15,Joined the bored for what  And thank to everyone I found someone
787241,misfish,2013-05-17 21:42:00,29133,Lock  er down Mods.
787247,aplumma,2013-05-17 22:28:00,6896,nite nite to this we all got a chance to say our peace and it will only get ugly from here.   Art
783657,outdoordude,2013-05-01 01:28:00,15,hello I am new on this site dose anyone know of any good custom rod builders that are affordable  thanks
783663,Christopheraaron,2013-05-01 01:41:00,3525,pmed you
783672,Nipfisher,2013-05-01 02:26:00,2449,"There are a few on this site. Speil, Kemper, and Garry2rs, are a few, sorry if I forgot others, they are just from memory."
783673,irishfield,2013-05-01 02:30:00,26272,"Guess it depends on your idea of affordable.  Spiel gets my vote for some amazing work... I'm sure others mentioned do some fine work too, but I've never fished with their creations vs 3 of Spiel's marvels."
783675,Gerritt,2013-05-01 02:35:00,6129,"Spiel, if he had a website I would give it to you... but here is a list of others around the world...  but the number one hit from google adsense is this site...  http://ca.wholesalesports.com/storefront/home/fishing/fresh-saltwater-fishing/rod-reel-combos/c0-c20-c201-c20108-p1.html?gclid=CKjG6qLv87YCFeZFMgodBzcA5Q      G"
783677,Gerritt,2013-05-01 02:39:00,6129,it can be done.... trust me..  unreal   first post custom rods...  LOL
783678,ChrisK,2013-05-01 02:43:00,2772,Spiel does top notch quality work and I highly recommend him.
783685,Joey,2013-05-01 02:54:00,9122,"I agree, I have a couple Spiel custom rods.  He would be first choice for me"
783687,danc,2013-05-01 02:55:00,4677,Another Spiel vote here.
783690,vance,2013-05-01 03:14:00,719,Spiels the man!!!!!!!  vance
783691,Gerritt,2013-05-01 03:19:00,6129,Yup great builder!
783712,Roy,2013-05-01 10:48:00,13728,I haven't bought anything other than Spiel rods in the last ten or so years.
783713,lew,2013-05-01 11:01:00,12766,There's a very good reason that everyone recommends Spiels custom rods.
783716,Live2fish85,2013-05-01 11:32:00,1633,"Spiel, hands down is the man to speak with. His work is always amazing."
783731,aplumma,2013-05-01 12:43:00,6896,Spiel has my vote he has built 5 rods for me over the years and the fit and finish are excellent. With the time and the components that Spiel uses make the rods more of an investment dollar for quality they are a real bargain.   Art
783776,outdoordude,2013-05-01 18:24:00,15,ok thanks guys dose spiel have a website
783777,Roy,2013-05-01 18:32:00,13728,You can PM him here. If you don't get an answer soon enough (he's busy) let me know and I'll PM you his email addy.
783783,Spiel,2013-05-01 18:52:00,9065,"PM answered Ethan and thanks for the nod guys (and Gal   ), much appreciated!"
783785,Terry,2013-05-01 19:05:00,14456,even I have one of his great rods
783807,misfish,2013-05-01 20:21:00,29133, Yep.thats a sweet creation. Got to see it on the weekend.  Another vote for the Spiel master.rod builder
783812,solopaddler,2013-05-01 20:45:00,8605,"I agree Spiel's work is good he's built several for me and is currently working on another at the moment.  Some of you may know this, many of you don't. Spiel has more or less taken over the reins of the custom steelhead rods from this guy:  http://www.jccustomtackle.com/   JC was always the best imo and if he's passing work along to Spiel as he slows down building himself that speaks volumes to me.  I know Spiel now gets most of his hand turned wood reel seats and butt caps from JC (he's still churning those out). That's another huge plus as JC has always turned the finest wood, at least imo..."
783821,esoxansteel,2013-05-01 21:11:00,1307,"Speil X 300, his work is impeccable, and 2nd to none, and stands 100% by his work"
786451,outdoordude,2013-05-14 05:00:00,15,ok thank I guys so much
786473,Fish Farmer,2013-05-14 11:42:00,2234,"Spiel ultra light rods catch Sheephead and Muskies. I wanted a ultra Light for Perch and Crappie.  I want a refund Now the Walleye rod he made me is another story, have to keep it locked up. Only rod that catches Walleye in our group of 8 guys. Nobody touches that deadly weapon. Spiel, #1 in my book. Linder's, my weapon is not for sale."
786485,Ryan Landry,2013-05-14 12:24:00,128,"There was a post on the float fishing board about this guy sticking a builder with all the materials for a build. Only heard the one side of the story, but he recommend getting a deposit from this Ethan fellow."
