787271,limeyangler,2013-05-18 01:34:00,5204,That hot tub is genius!  Great report guys.
787365,adolson,2013-05-19 07:08:00,783,"Nice report - uh, silly question - did you happen to go to WalMart in New Liskeard a couple days ago? Probably not, but... I saw someone there in the sporting department that kinda looked like you.. If it was you, you were wearing a Lake Nipissing North Bay tshirt.  Probably someone else... But it's plausible that you came through this way after your trip and stopped to restock spoons or something.. I don't know.  Had to ask after I saw the report!"

786839,TJQ,2013-05-15 23:56:00,7806,"Well after 6 long months and a ton of snow it was time to get up to Matachewan to see what was left of camp.  We were last there at the end of Oct. and I was anxious to see #1 what repairs we would have to make for the summer, and #2 how high the water was as we were getting reports that were cause for great concern.,  It was with a happy heart that we got there and it was like nothing had changed since we left. We were very pleased.  I spent the first half of the week with Avery having a bit of Dad/Son time before he heads off north next week for work, and then Monique came up for the last bit of the week and the weekend.  Did a bit of fishing with Avery but the river was swollen and very fast and we couldn't get a bite!  Monique arrived and with her the weather changed to cold and windy, BUT it made the fish more active for some reason and we did pretty good.  I was using spoons from the store exclusively and I now have found my new favorite!!  There was still plenty of snow on the ground on the way in..    But once we got there it was nice!!    The water was high  about 7 feet higher than the august low.. right up to the firepit! Glad we tied everything down.. stuff was floating!    First thing I did was see if my redneck hotytub worked.. and it did!!        Now I gotta build a better tub!!  When Monique got there we commenced to fishing, heres some great pictures... LOTS of smaller pike, they were the only things that seemed really actibve!                                    Can't wait to get back and bring my new outboard in, we've resolved to do one back lake every time we make a trip in this summer."

786849,danc,2013-05-16 00:10:00,4677,"Fun times TJ. My go to lake for May long is still frozen, so it looks like I'll miss the May long fishing for the first time in about 40 years. But look out fish for the weekend after that."
786851,TJQ,2013-05-16 00:19:00,7806,LOL.. I forgot to add this picture!!     Thye are figuring that Averys Job may be hard to get into as well...   50' feet behind the boat and just troll slow ... easy peazy!

786976,Tootsie II,2013-05-16 13:24:00,162,"Man, TJ, are you making me homesick for the Northern bush. We'll be up in the Shining Tree area during first week of June for 8 days. It may be just bush to some people but it's heaven to us!"
786991,Ron,2013-05-16 14:19:00,1683,"I wish we had pictures of our Red Neck hot tub.  It was an old claw foot bath tub, nice and deep. All we did is built a fire under that cast iron baby. Mind you, looks like you got room for 2 in your setup.  Wish we had of kept our little ITEK swimming pool for you.  The type that had a blow up ring on the top of it. It has the spots to hook up the hoses, came with a filter pump and everything. You could easily have 4 adults in it at the same time.  Might be something to think about, maybe KIJII..."
786994,solopaddler,2013-05-16 14:26:00,8605,Glad to see your camp made it through the winter unscathed TJ. Great inaugural trip!  Cheers

787036,aplumma,2013-05-16 17:27:00,6896,Go to any plumbing supply and get the sheet goods for building a shower pan. It is a plastic that can be glued together as needed and is flexible enough to fold the corners.   Art
