Not huge but just missed the complete skunk of the day lol.. Water temp was 49*F, little cold I think for a big catch day,but was still good to get out! Here's a pick of the one.Released for another day."
787346,Rizzo,2013-05-19 00:31:00,4754,ouch...I'm after pike on Monday hopefully things pick up!
787353,Jigger,2013-05-19 00:57:00,1237,49deg? Where were you fishing? Got out for abit in Haliburton and the water was creeping up on 60deg. Didn't get into any fish but it was nice to get the boat out. That kind of temperature makes for a tough day for sure. Sounds more like laker temp. You avoided the skunk though!
787390,Rizzo,2013-05-19 15:44:00,4754,"ya I was kinda shocked by the 49 number too, but I haven't been out yet so did not know what to expect. I guess its 49 somewhere but hopefully warmer at Mitchell's Bay where we're headed"

My hummingbird doesn't give water temp,so I was just going by what they said.All I know was there weren't the usuall follow ups or hits I usually get. Still good times."
