Thanks!  Yv "

343290,youngvedder,2009-05-20 16:48:00,72,"hmm, interesting. any thoughts what would cause it?  it was really this particular area that outlined these ""fish"" it was right around a drop off, and cound not see it outside of this area.  since I am new to the finder, why would I not want the fish ID on? bad readings?  thx!
