787372,Fish Farmer,2013-05-19 11:36:00,2234,"Thanks Guys I'd like to get back out, maybe next week.  â€‹ Your right Roy. Fish storage box, water was 48 that day on the surface. Ended with 71 keepers. 13.25"" was the biggest. Buddy that was with me was blown away, couldn't believe the fishing and the amount of boats.  Gota get down this way Bro.  Didn't get out to the group, found a school just in from you guys.  I move around with the Electric slowly till we see the school on the bottom then anchor. Sometimes they move a pit, Just have to move 100"" or so till you get on them again. I find you have to use the zoom on your finder to see them, very close to the bottom. If you see a red Princecraft with a 50 Honda Tiller just come over and anchor close say hi. There's lots out there for everyone.  Should try and get out Phil, Old Pete was with me that day. I guess Murray is going up with Andy & John in June. Wish I was going with the boys. One of these years"
787398,Leecher,2013-05-19 16:48:00,7832,Great job Dave!!! Good haul   Bet cleaning those beauties took longer then putting them into your livewell eh   That's enough for a good feed
