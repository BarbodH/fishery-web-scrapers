786886,mcdougy,2013-05-16 01:42:00,274,"I have never had a stern mount trolling motor till now, Ive never paid attention to what everyone does with it while trailering the boat.  Could you people tell me what you do with your transom mount electric motors while going down the highway?  Cheers Matt"
786922,DRIFTER_016,2013-05-16 02:52:00,10439,Straight up and down with it raised up high. I hope that makes sense.
786929,mcdougy,2013-05-16 03:41:00,274,yup....but with my boat cover it may make more sense toraise it up and tilt it inside. Does that pose a diaster IYO?
786933,mike rousseau,2013-05-16 06:22:00,4661,Vertical....
786942,Handlebarz,2013-05-16 10:08:00,3790,I tilted mine inside as I had fears of the wing nut coming loose and the motor bouncing down the road we lived in Sudbury when we had one.
786945,NAW,2013-05-16 10:30:00,4022,"What Drifter said..  Just make sure you set it in place good and tight.  I also use one of my mooring ropes, and give it a few wraps around the motor mounting base.....Just in case something breaks, and it falls off..  I don't want it to end up through someone windshield behind me.  The motor part is the heaviest, down by the prop.  So I always try to get that as close the mounting bracket as possible when tailoring.  Least amount of stress on the plastic mounting bracket."
787082,lookinforwalleye,2013-05-16 20:52:00,4399,if it is a concern put it in the vehicle or the floor of the boat...doesn`t take that long to re-install.
787088,aplumma,2013-05-16 20:59:00,6896,Unclamp it and place it on the floor of the boat. If not then vertical puts the stress in line with the transom which will prevent any damage. If you leave it in the horizontal then it is has the leverage and the weight to torque the transom.  A strong transom though should not have an issue with a horizontal electrical trolling motor.

787109,Fisherman,2013-05-16 22:07:00,7201,"x2 what Art said and if you stop somewhere for lunch/gas put it in the truck, how long does it take to unwind a couple of wingnuts."
787158,mcdougy,2013-05-17 11:27:00,274,"I wasnt sure if placing it on the floor of the boat would cause damage to it or not. i built a motor box for the outboard and put it on the floor, vs leaving it hanging on the transom.  Maybe I will do the same with the trolling motor.  Cheers and thanks for the advice. Matt  I will be in the picton area  this weekend and may have an open seat if anyones looking."
