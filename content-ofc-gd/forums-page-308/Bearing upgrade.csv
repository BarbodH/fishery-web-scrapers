787275,SirWhite,2013-05-18 02:25:00,210,Thinking of doing a bearing upgrade soon. I have thought to go for the Boca orange seal. Any ideas on these and is eBay the best place to purchase them?

I ordered mine off of tackle warehouse only because I was ordering a cf handle and knobs off of there as well. They were about a dollar more but I saved money on shipping.  I grabbed the boca orange seals because they will be easier to service. The seals pop in and out quite easily. You can also run them dry or with lube, and with or without seals. If you lube them, use a light lube. I used the Abu reel oil and it seems to be a little thicker compared to bit sauce or the boca light in lube."
