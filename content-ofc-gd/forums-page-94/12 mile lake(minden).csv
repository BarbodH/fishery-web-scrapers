237596,JoshS,2008-08-08 03:20:00,729,"I fished twelve mile and the connecting lakes quite a bit when I was younger.  I never fished for lakers, I was more into the smallmouth.  All three lakes (Boshkung, Little Boshkung, and Twelve Mile) had decent bass fishing with more smallmouth than largemouth being caught. There are some pretty obvious spots on the lake that hold fish, you'll see them.  When the fishing pressure was on, I used to catch smallmouth mid lake on little bosh, the lakes not that deep or big so you can cover the open water effectively and usually locate some untapped willing fish.  Goodluck!"
