1002266,captpierre,2017-05-04 00:26:00,2521,Yup. Get your pooches on good tick prevention Oral or topical. Should start April 1.
1002271,Old Ironmaker,2017-05-04 00:42:00,8243,Not just pets. Anyone walking in high grass and bush should look closely for ticks that want a ride after your hike. On a local Talk Radio a lady from the Heath Dept was on telling everyone to check their kids and themselves as well as pets for ticks after just walking in the park. Buddy got 3 on his calf last spring on the golf course and my wife got 1 on her abdomen a few years ago doing spring clean up on our property.
1002290,Beans,2017-05-04 12:27:00,3339,I picked up one on my pant leg while riding on my lawn tractor along the edge of my property last year..
1002305,OhioFisherman,2017-05-04 17:08:00,6623,"When I first got sick years ago a couple of things the tested me for early were Lyme Disease and West Nile virus, because I live in a rural area and was outdoors a lot and frequently around animals. I saw a tick once when I took my dog to the vet for his shot updates, it was crawling across the floor, but didn't make it far, squish!  http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/toronto/powassan-virus-prompts-officials-to-expand-tick-monitoring-1.3036326  http://www.ctvnews.ca/health/experts-warn-of-lesser-known-tick-disease-powassan-virus-1.3397738  Stuff sounds like bad news! and keep an eye on your kids?"

1002314,Garnet,2017-05-04 19:25:00,2056,I but one on the street like that. Also started and ran like a charm until you hit 1 blade of grass. Zero compression stalled every time.  Scrapper got it.
1002315,Bill Shearer,2017-05-04 19:33:00,456,^ I think that might be for the lawnmower thread? lol

Just check when ya get home and wash your clothes, I rarely find one feasting. Not sure if I posted this here already, but Rick get yourself a bottle of Ultra Shield EX by Absorbine. I get  it a TSC but any place that sells horse stuff should carry it. It kills and repels many insects. Set apart some sets of clothing for outdoor use.  Spray them well and let dry. The ingredients will stay effective through several washings even. So long as you seal ankles and wrists you will have no ticks on you at all. You can also use it on your dogs and their bedding areas for more protection. They say it lasts 17 days on horses. They used to have info for dogs on the bottles too but not allowed in Canada anymore. The American ones still do.  http://absorbine.com/products/fly-control/ultrashield-ex/  Cheers"
