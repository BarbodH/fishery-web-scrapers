To the point that i actually loosened my grip on its neck and it didnt fight back, ive got it on video!  I have no idea how that bear was breathing still considering how tight that bucket is."

1002982,grimsbylander,2017-05-11 20:41:00,3016,I agree completely. Can't very well remove the line to save it...then choke that fish chicken!!!
1003005,npt1,2017-05-12 01:08:00,220, Just tighten the line that is already there.!
1003067,Headhunter,2017-05-12 16:03:00,5703,"This is taken from an old cormorant thread for this site, years ago... Cormorant RecipeHaving shot your cormorant, hold it well away from you as you carry it home; these birds are exceedingly verminous and the lice are said to be not entirely host-specific. Hang up by the feet with a piece of wire, soak in petrol and set on fire. This treatment both removes most of the feathers and kills the lice.When the smoke has cleared away, take the cormorant down and cut off the beak. Send this to the local Conservancy Board who, if you are in the right area, will give you 3/6d or sometimes 5/- for it. Bury the carcase, preferably in a light sandy soil, and leave it there for a fortnight. This is said to improve the flavour by removing, in part at least, the taste of rotting fish.Dig up and skin and draw the bird. Place in a strong salt and water solution and soak for 48 hours. Remove, dry, stuff with whole, unpeeled onions: the onion skins are supposed to bleach the meat to a small extent, so that it is very dark brown instead of being entirely black.Simmer gently in seawater, to which two tablespoons of chloride of lime have been added, for six hours. This has a further tenderising effect. Take out of the water and allow to dry, meanwhile mixing up a stiff paste of methylated spirit and curry powder. Spread this mixture liberally over the breast of the bird.Finally roast in a very hot oven for three hours. The result is unbelievable. Throw it away. Not even a starving vulture would eat it. Why would you let your dog? HH"
