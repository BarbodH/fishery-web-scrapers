I just get basspro to do it now, its free, you can even bring in your old spooled line, you dont even need to purchase line. They put the backing on as well. Never have problems when their machine does it."
1002694,PUMP KNOWS,2017-05-09 13:31:00,937,Thanks guys.  I had a similar problem but my mono was spooled to loose and it dug into my spool.  I'll be going to Sail to have them spool my reel.
1002695,Raf,2017-05-09 13:35:00,3495,"if doing it yourself, it helps to have a helper.  have them put the spool on a screwdriver, put work gloves on and apply pressure (not so much that you can't reel it in) to the spool while you point the rod at the person and fill the reel."
1002706,mepps,2017-05-09 15:11:00,1301,"I use the Curado 301E regularly and love it. St Croix is always a safe bet, but if you want to keep the price low, Bass Pro musky rods are solid without breaking the bank. I've caught several tarpon my BPS musky rod and cast some fair size lures too.  My go to musky rods are from Tackle Industries, but I'm not sure if they have a 2 piece."

Can you guys recommend a setup for my needs?  I did some research and I found a Shimano Curado 301E for a good left handed baitcaster.

988356,Old Ironmaker,2016-12-11 06:12:00,8243,"Not a Musky guy here. I did go on a charter with Dan Columby and used the Shimano Curado and Calais if I remember that Danny supplied. It did not tire me and had not a single birds nest all day. I am not a bait cast user at all. That says a lot for the reel. I did pick one up a used Curado this year and love it. From light tubes for Smallies to heavy stuff I tossed for Northerns this year it worked well.  I wouldn't rule out trolling for them. Why would you? You don't need to troll slow which limits many without a smaller kicker or electric.  If you want to learn in 1 day that can take you many years to experience solo contact Dan Columby. He is out of Calendar Bay on Nipissing. I believe he is a sponsor here, I am not trying to break any rules.  Well worth it. I never went for Musky specifically before for them, 1 incidental catch years ago fishing for Walleye. I got 2 nice fish in the 5 hours we were out . Dan was disappointed I was over the Moon. I have boated 8 since then on our own  in only 3 days of fishing specifically for Musky. 6 were trolling at 4.5 miles per hour with short leads in the prop wash. Dan taught me that. 2 were casting, don't rule out trolling, for sure.  If you figure a day out on your own boat costs are 50 to 75 bucks, probably more, and fish for 4 or 6 days blind a day and come up with nothing then a day with a Pro is money well invested. Invested not spent.  Johnny D"
988365,Weeds,2016-12-11 12:49:00,782,"I meant to give you a more detailed response but the iPad ran out of juice. There are a bunch of guys on this board with far more experience than me but I'll give you my 5 cents worth anyways. I was a frequent but casual musky angler, lots of outings but Short ones, sneaking in an hour or two here and there. If you plan on spending 8 to 12 hours on the water my input may not apply. I've owned a bunch of different rods in different lengths and actions and a few reels but looking back I think the most versatile of them all was a 7'6  MH premier musky rod. No such thing as a do it all rod but this was the closest I ever came to finding it. I had it paired with a few different reels and although the Abu c3 (6501 left handed) seems to have fallen from favour these days, I liked it. Reasonably low gear ratio, good line capacity, clicker, decent drag and mine cast quite nicely. No, it probably won't last forever and won't excel at burning big buck tails or picking up slack line but in my opinion a decent do it all kind of reel at a good price. Felt like it paired well with that rod. If I ever find the coin to refit myself with a solid musky set up I'd be content with that set up."

My okuma EVX extra heavy 8'6"" collapses to 6'11"". It's a great working setup. I use this for Muskie on ALL lakes I fish. This combo also goes with me for tossing smaller lures like Gliden Raps and small invaders for pike. Depending on size of Pike in the lakes you fish, it might be a little overkill. You can see the rod in the background in this pic too. My buddy is using the NaCl as the combo.   Most important, make sure you go with high speed reels. I am using a power handle on the Lexa 400 and a double paddle on my NaCl for jerk baits.  Cheers, Ron..."

It will have both left and right hand retrieves available as well as high and low gear ratios.IMO, This will be a great Musky reel but may be out of your price range.  The real reason I bring this up is that you may see some deals on the curado 300 or the older version Tranx. The new Tranx looks more like a Curado than the original Tranx but has a price point closer to the 300E. With that out there, my advice would be to wait a bit and see what comes out at the bassmaster classic or if you can, ICAST 2017."

If you're going few times a year and don't plan on throwing large bucktails, then you can get by with a curado. But the curado 300 is definitely not a good reel for big bucktails. I have one and have grown to use it only for small bucktails and topwaters. One bonus is it doubles as a good pike reel for bigger baits..  If you're dead set on shimano and are looking for an all round versatile reel to handle every bait, go with calcutta or tranx. For $500 combo, I'd be getting an all around rod like a premier 8' H and a used calcutta d or something equal in versatility. A new calcutta B can be found within your budget as well. There are other options that should be considered aside from shimano. I've had good experiences with warranty from abu as well. Tons of reviews on all reels online.  There are rumours of a new smaller tranx coming out soon, makes sense to confirm that and wait. Might drop the price on the old tranx or put some more used ones out there."
