1002151,Rattletrap2,2017-05-02 15:20:00,1652,I was looking for this design but it was not available for some strange reason...   wynne.jpg   That would keep more than just the bugs away from you. Kinda creepy looking!

1002188,Old Ironmaker,2017-05-02 22:58:00,8243,"Can't eat or drink with them on? I found out what bugs really were like last May in the PAB region, I never have seen anything like them in 62 years. Wow. My 35 year old mesh bug hat worked very well not too cool looking. 10 guys sitting at a table eating with bug nets on is a strange sight. I also find it hard to understand what someone is trying to say when they have a buff on. Like ""Watch out for the rocks!!"""

You literally cannot breath at sunset without something covering your nose or mouth. if you breath, you eat or snort bugs lol...and trust me I wish i was exaggerating...sadly I am not."

1002280,Old Ironmaker,2017-05-04 01:21:00,8243,"Long woolen underwear is prerequisite safety clothing 12 months a year working around he Blast Furnaces to stay cool.  Guys I showed my Cosmetologist wife the muffs online. They are only PF40 which I thought was fine, she said minimum is PF60. So lather up under them as well. When we were beach bums we slathered on Baby Oil and Coconut butter to cook our skin. Many of my pals who hung out in the 70's and 80's now have skin cancer. A very high percentage of Pro golfers from that era as well have skin cancer. No one protected themselves, not even hats. I have brown spots on my temples, back of my neck and cheeks that have come out the size of quarters in the last few years. Not good. Cover up while you still can."
1002284,GBW,2017-05-04 02:10:00,8460,"my order should be here Friday, woohoo!"

1001734,Fisherman,2017-04-25 23:18:00,7201,"Don't know if anyone has any interest, the price is right.  I use them in the boat to prevent lobster face and while riding ATV to stop eating dirt. https://safishing.com/lp/buy-1-get-4-free-face-shields-go-dom5/?gclid=CLTE8ZrewNMCFQQoaQodmE8G3Q"
1001736,DanD,2017-04-25 23:39:00,2223,Are you from Mexican decent? LOL They actually do look handy.  Dan.
1001741,Fisherman,2017-04-26 00:17:00,7201,"No, I thought they were a bit of a gimmick too, but no more lobster face on the calm sunny days.  They also keep out the damm fuzzy flies while on the water."
1001745,ecmilley,2017-04-26 00:59:00,2163,I use the uv buff pretty much same concept
1001757,DRIFTER_016,2017-04-26 02:28:00,10439,I have a ton of SA face shields. Got a bunch of the light summer ones and 1/2 dozen or so of the winter ones as well. The winter ones are awesome. Wind blocker with fleece liner. Super warm and toasty even up here North of 60*.  Summer    â€‹Fall (wore this for Halloween at the college)    Winter    
1001802,SuperDave,2017-04-26 17:43:00,204,Yup those face shields do the trick. Got 5 for $15 from SA company saw it on Facebook. No pun intended!
1001805,GBW,2017-04-26 18:31:00,8460,Yup those face shields do the trick. Got 5 for $15 from SA company saw it on Facebook. No pun intended! When I tried the code (5FACE) it came up $89 *edit to change as I just tried to order some again*
1001806,GBW,2017-04-26 18:46:00,8460,FINALLY got it to work for $25 inc shipping.... 
1001810,Terry,2017-04-26 19:38:00,14456,so thats 25 US
1001819,AKRISONER,2017-04-26 20:20:00,5558,"These things seem gimmicky like people wear them just to look cool...but they are maybe one of the best things I have started using while fishing in a long time   ive got more of these SA buffs kicking around my place than i know what to do with.  Bass opener in PAB is absolutely relentless when it comes to bugs, blackflies, mosquitoes, deer flys, horse flys all out in full force...wear a buff...no issues  I have always been extremely susceptiable to heat/sunstroke specifically when standing out in the sun all day on the boat in +30 degree weather. These things have been an absolute life saver for me and have totally changed the game.  Dunking a buff into the lake and putting it back on, them along with a fishing shirt, hat and glasses. I now can fish in 35+ degree weather all day without issue.  \  the insulated ones were friggin awesome ice fishing this winter as well!  when it gets super hot, who would have thought, more clothing was going to be the key to staying comfortable!"
1001823,GBW,2017-04-26 20:49:00,8460,so thats 25 US yes but still less cash than 2 at BPS and now my kids and I will be covered.
1001824,SuperDave,2017-04-26 20:58:00,204,"That's right. They are $25 for 1 in the stores. Plus, SA company has cool designs!"
1001825,Tom S,2017-04-26 21:10:00,362,"when it gets super hot, who would have thought, more clothing was going to be the key to staying comfortable!  People who live in the middle east?"
1001826,Terry,2017-04-26 21:23:00,14456,yeah I have bought them before but I thought people should know that they are not 25 CND
1001827,GBW,2017-04-26 21:30:00,8460,yeah I have bought them before but I thought people should know that they are not 25 CND It's all good Terry.

1001910,GBW,2017-04-28 00:52:00,8460,Kind of looking forward to getting these and to see the look on my son's face for the skull one's.  And of course my daughter and the pink camo.  She fishes more than he does but with luck these may sway him to get out more (he's only 10) with 'the cool skull mask'
1001924,b_cdot,2017-04-28 04:53:00,270,how did you get 5 for $15. Says 5 for 20 plus 10 shipping
1001925,b_cdot,2017-04-28 05:12:00,270,NM figured it out
1001932,Sterling,2017-04-28 11:36:00,477,"I just spent a good hour on their site and the way pricing works is genius. Ended up buying 23 total after figuring out how to get them cheap (mostly going to be gifts).  This company hopes you buy singles for $25 USD.  Otherwise they have great deals on packs. You can buy 5 for $25 + shipping = $8 CAD each approximately.  Or you can buy the 12 pack and pay $5 each. Add the 12 pack to cart, then apply the SAVE80 coupon which is 80% off.  For the fleece ones, you can buy say, the 11 pack and apply the FLEECE5 coupon for 83% off.  Thing is, you can't apply both in a single order.  So I placed two separate orders and got both the 80% off and 83%. Had to pay the extra $10 in shipping but that's ok.  Edit: I just saw an ad on this site that brought me to their 5 for $15 deal https://safishing.com/?product=5-for-15-face-shields-free-decal#configuration"
