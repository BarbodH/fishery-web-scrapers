1002998,Sinker,2017-05-11 23:03:00,8692,"Quinte was like running a gauntlet the last couple days. Full trees, logs, docks and anything else you can think of."
1003003,OhioFisherman,2017-05-12 00:12:00,6623,Watch out for drifting pontoon boats and docks.

1003033,Beans,2017-05-12 12:21:00,3339,I was amazed at the number of docks floating where they should not have been yesterday and the number of cars/trucks trailering boats...must be opening of pickeral season in the Kawarthas...

1003141,Old Ironmaker,2017-05-12 23:21:00,8243,Come on details. The Grand River below Dunnville looks like a few barges of logs capsized. I wouldn't recommend boating there for a while.
