1002333,Musky Plug,2017-05-05 00:05:00,398,"It was a good show, big turn out. Arrived at 8:30 and the Wick Onez booth was sold out. I was thankfully able to get one of the few remaining hose shads. Also picked up a Blue Water Bait from Lidio and a new Trofik 5 bait. Both guys make some great stuff."
1002463,smithy97,2017-05-06 14:34:00,70,"I agree on the BWB and Trofik 5 baits- amazing quality and the owners were great guys to talk to. I picked up some Northmen Outdoors big dirtys and cabbage cutters, a Bondy bait, a custom SSpanky double 10, and an Apache triple 9. Will be picking up some trolling baits next Odyssey for sure."
