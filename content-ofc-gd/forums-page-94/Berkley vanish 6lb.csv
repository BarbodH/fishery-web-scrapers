1002679,b_cdot,2017-05-09 04:03:00,270,This turned really funny. I usually use 6 or 8lb leader for my drop shotting application also for jigging walleyes in the rivers. I dont think 6 is too light and I dont think 10 is too heavy. I have had great success with palomar knots with fluoro but I find if you cinch it down wrong it will weaken the knot significantly. I think the 6lb vanish is just crap to begin with. Thanks for the replies and suggestions. I'm stealing that knot diagram btw so I can perfect that knot

1002693,limeyangler,2017-05-09 13:01:00,5204,"I've got Vanish in 10# and 12# and it's been good to me. I don't know if I would buy it again because everybody seems to say it's crap, lol. Double uni to the braid and improved clinch to the bait, never palomar.  Isn't 6# a little light for Great Lakes SMB?   I use those lb tests too but in the Berkeley Vanish Transition, same knot to the bait as you Chris, i just use a micro barrel swivel to the main line, again with the improved clinch knot, been using this stuff for at least 8 years know, handles everything in my experience and takes a pounding some days."
1002696,PUMP KNOWS,2017-05-09 13:39:00,937,Contact Berkley customers service and tell them your situation.  They might be able to send you a new spool.
1002550,b_cdot,2017-05-08 01:13:00,270,I bought a spool of this stuff a while ago. Started using and half of my knots break. I tie a palomar and I tie it right. I want to use this line for jigs and drop shotting for great lakes smbs. No confidence in this line or maybe the knot strength. Anyone with similar issues? Anyone ever get a bad spool? Should i throw it out or does anyone have some knots that they have had good success with with this line? Thanks
1002553,GBW,2017-05-08 01:49:00,8460,"toss it!  I had a spool for the same intent and lost more fish than landed and I'll never by ""vanish"" again cause that's all your lures and fish do is vanish..."
1002556,manitoubass2,2017-05-08 02:00:00,11391,"What geoff said, I tried this for leader material and you can't even set a hook. Just snaps"

Thanks  I used Berkley Vanish, but with an improved clinch knot, wet before you tighten the knot? One of my former fishing partners was also a tournament crappie fisherman, then I started taking him Lake Erie smallie fishing. He used 4 and 6 # test for crappie, I never saw someone lose so many smallies due to the line breaking, and it wasn't Vanish he was using. Them zebra mussel will play heck with your line, I never went lighter than 8# test, and usually 10# test, a little nick is all it takes to lose a fish?"
1002567,b_cdot,2017-05-08 04:55:00,270,Thanks ppl! What a waste of money.
1002568,b_cdot,2017-05-08 04:57:00,270, Haha nice
1002569,b_cdot,2017-05-08 04:58:00,270,Ive had great success with trilene 100% pro and seaguar invisx. Why would they even put it on the shelves?
1002570,b_cdot,2017-05-08 05:01:00,270,Ive only used it a couple times in the field but when i tie at home and pull it breaks. I try it in the field when i pull and the odd time it doesnt break.
1002572,b_cdot,2017-05-08 05:40:00,270,So i tried the shaw grigsby knot on it. Its strong but its a bulky knot with 3 leads to cut. Overkill not necessary. I just want to tie my palomar and know its strong
1002575,Garnet,2017-05-08 11:00:00,2056,This stuff was garbage 20 years ago and still is. XPS BPS Flouro.
1002577,Musky Plug,2017-05-08 11:13:00,398,Lmao   I've never used that brand of flouro. I use either seaguar and recently been trying sunline both I would say are good.
1002579,fish_fishburn,2017-05-08 11:50:00,1311,Try the knot your Granny showed you then throw the spool of line in the garbage. That stuff is junk.
1002596,TJQ,2017-05-08 14:10:00,7806,Yup.. someone gave me a bunch of it.. lol.. i just thought it was old..
1002601,dave524,2017-05-08 14:51:00,4508,try this knot   
1002603,TJQ,2017-05-08 14:54:00,7806,hahahahahaha... nice.  that looks like every knot i tie.
1002605,BillM,2017-05-08 15:01:00,17367,lol @ Dave!!!  that's hilarious!
1002606,fishindevil,2017-05-08 15:01:00,6254,yes vanish is complete crap.....throw it out and never bother with it again....lots of better line out there to use......
1002608,AKRISONER,2017-05-08 15:09:00,5558,"rule of thumb, never tie a palomar knot with flurocarbon or mono...especially anything light, it burns the line when it cinches.  Only time im using a palomar with mono or fluro is when im using stand up drop shot hooks otherwise stick to something else. Palomar is the best knot bar none for braid though.  Ive literally just started using the uni knot for any standard knot applications...easy as hell to tie even with cold hands and hasnt come unspooled yet. Was tying the improved cinch for years and the number of times it failed on me is upsetting.  Dave that info graphic is hilarious."
1002611,manitoubass2,2017-05-08 15:11:00,11391,Dave that's the best post I've seen in forever ?????
1002625,GBW,2017-05-08 18:00:00,8460,don't get this either! 
1002642,misfish,2017-05-08 20:05:00,29133,The P-LINE line is worth a look at. Never an issue. I like the floro clear in all lb test.
1002648,Weeds,2017-05-08 21:25:00,782,"Anybody ever manage to get their money back on this? You'd figure with so many dissatisfied customers and Berkley being a somewhat reputable company it would be worth taking a stab at a refund or exchange, rather than just checking it out."
1002649,Weeds,2017-05-08 21:28:00,782,Rather than just chucking it out I mean. I could swear the edit button has disappeared.
1002650,huzzsaba,2017-05-08 21:47:00,884,Personally I like maxima Ultragreen tied to spider wire braid.
