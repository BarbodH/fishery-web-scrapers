999889,jimmer,2017-04-10 17:37:00,2730,I took a walk down to the lock in Lindsay at lunch today and saw a few walleye setting up for the annual spawn.  Here's hoping for a successful one.
999890,manitoubass2,2017-04-10 17:44:00,11391,Frogs are out. That's the tell tale sign.  Get laid walleyes!!!!
999898,GBW,2017-04-10 18:19:00,8460,I'll be there Sat with the kids playing in the park and watching all the fish come up to spawn.  The perch spawn is good too as the musky come in to gorge.

Always used to love going down there this time of year when I went to Fleming College. Was always so peaceful and motivating.
1002066,GBW,2017-04-30 21:33:00,8460,I just got back from a little walk around there as I was coming home from dropping off my kids and there are a few eye's left mixed in the large amounts of small perch and odd gill.  Even a nice size bass hanging out with the bigger perch.
1002089,Sinker,2017-05-01 13:17:00,8692,Most of the walleye are already done. Hopefully headed back to my spring holes where I can lay a beating on them in a couple weeks  S.

1002120,moxie,2017-05-01 21:07:00,1566," We roughed them up pretty good a couple a weeks ago on our first trip on the Detroit River. I couldn't agree more though. ""Hurry up guys and gals !! You taste much better than those dual Citizenship Wallys!!"""

1002279,GBW,2017-05-04 01:13:00,8460,The ones in Lindsay are off limits...I assume you are fishing else where? Oh yes he is.  He's well aware of the seasons and when and where.  Also I'm sure has a stack of honey holes on many a lake in the area when the season is open here.
1002306,Sinker,2017-05-04 17:10:00,8692,YUP!
