1002988,irishfield,2017-05-11 21:37:00,26272,"LOL... glad it worked out Jeremey, unless of course the old man wanted a new boat!!"
1002990,GBW,2017-05-11 21:41:00,8460,good to hear all will be well and it's been found. Chain from dock to tree vs rope is how I'd go.
1002991,misfish,2017-05-11 22:01:00,29133,The water is way up. Buddy said it was up to the top stairs from the normal water line. Now you know how high the water is Jer.  Glad it all worked out.
1003030,Acountdeleted,2017-05-12 11:44:00,2562,"Thanks everyone. I can't believe how high the water is. (Except I can because I see it every morning on lake O). Hopefully will keep some of my favourite spots open this year.  A good lesson to learn, thankfully not at a cost."
1002828,chris.brock,2017-05-10 17:16:00,4053, The each pontoon has at least a couple chambers. It's unlikely that all the chambers were punctured and the thing sunk to the bottom and now isn't visible.  The cops should chain up a tinner with a decent 9.9 locked to it with a GPS tracking device (they're cheap) in the motor and wait. Jeremy's boat launch would be a perfect spot for this. It's simple and easy. There's probably only a couple guys responsible for all these thefts. Frustrates the hell out of me.
1002832,Headhunter,2017-05-10 17:41:00,5703,"My former boss had a place on Kashabog (sp). They were robbed/broken into on a regular basis. The OPP described the theives as ""mom and pop Kettle out doing their grocery and small appliance shopping. They stole food, small appliances, anything they could easily carry out of the cottage. OPP ""promised"" to keep a closer eye on things, well you can imagine how that went! They eventually put in a security system, that would alert them at there home in Toronto should anyone be breaking in. The darn thing went off so many times, it was nuts. They eventually sold off the cottage, too much worry and driving 2 hours back and forth, every time the alarm went off. Cops were sure it was always the same people as they would come back after some following their initial break in, to scoup up all the new things that insurance replaced. OP, I wish you luck. HH"
1002833,Old Ironmaker,2017-05-10 17:47:00,8243,"I find it hard to believe anyone would take both the boat and the dock, any pro POS thief could easily break the largest chain with many of the battery operated tools out their today. Like it was said here they aren't the easiest boats to trailer. On the other hand like Chris said it is very unlikely a pontoon boat would sink to the bottom so quickly. The lake being only 15' deep some of that boat would be sticking up out of the water. Are there any back bays it may have drifted into? Strange to say the least.  We live in the cottage full time now. More and more folks are downsizing and winterizing and doing some big remodelling and are living here on the point full time now. No one lived here full time when we bought 21 years ago. Theft back then every winter was a regular thing. It was mostly country kids with nothing better to do looking for booze and a party. There hasn't been a break in in the last 17 years since we moved here full time. Most that come on weekends are former owners of northern properties and I would say 75% are from the GTA. There is no better theft security than neighbours. When we weren't here years back I kept lights on timers and a car that didn't run well but looked like it did in the driveway at all times, I went so far that a current sticker was on the vehicle and moving it occasionally. A local High School kid cleaned snow to the doorway and kept the driveway clear and the car cleaned off. In exchange I gave him a key and he and his pals could have a place to hang out and they left the place cleaner than they found it. My brother does the same thing at their cottage on Georgian Bay as do many here now."
1002836,BillM,2017-05-10 18:18:00,17367,"Agreed with above, I'm guessing are both at the bottom of the lake somewhere."
1002837,Acountdeleted,2017-05-10 18:39:00,2562,"No real back bays. The lake is pretty open. You can almost see the entire lake from any point on it. Two rivers but they are near impossible to 'drift' into. And one doesn't really go anywhere. Technically 3 if you count Rush lake. The more advice I'm hearing about this, the stranger and stranger it sounds. Now I don't think it's theft or sunk. But what could it be?"
1002838,chris.brock,2017-05-10 19:09:00,4053,Most pontoon boats are 8' wide and would fit (maybe not perfectly) on an over sized pontoon bunk trailer like I have. So it wouldn't be unheard of to steal it. Mostly likely it drifted away though.
1002840,misfish,2017-05-10 19:58:00,29133,"If it was floating about on this lake, it would be found. It can be covered in about 20 minutes round trip. If you aint found it Jer, then it,s gone.  Shame."

1002852,moxie,2017-05-10 22:50:00,1566, I'd bet Mother Nature had something to do with it
1002859,Acountdeleted,2017-05-10 23:55:00,2562,Haha. Thanks bud. Needed that.
1002889,Garnet,2017-05-11 10:21:00,2056,Think I would go down and flip those float plane guys a hundred to look when they are doing there other stuff.
1002929,Acountdeleted,2017-05-11 15:58:00,2562,"So, an update.  Turns out my dad didn't actually take the 16' Springbok out and search the lake for the boat (told me today he couldn't get the motor working)............. I'm not actually sure what he did, because OPP called and found the boat down on the south end of the lake hung up in some trees. Dock still attached and all. Looks like only some scratches to the boat and it didn't damage anyone else's property.  Thanks everyone for all the help and kind wishes while this was going on. Looks like Mother Nature was the culprit on this one."
1002930,BillM,2017-05-11 16:03:00,17367,Glad the mystery is finally solved
1002934,OhioFisherman,2017-05-11 16:15:00,6623,"Glad to hear it was found with a minimum amount of damage, might need to drop an anchor over the side when no one is around?"
1002936,jimmer,2017-05-11 16:24:00,2730,Good news!  That water can really catch people off guard when it rises quickly.  Always good to add a few tie offs in the spring.

1002987,mukluk,2017-05-11 21:24:00,196,Looks like Irishfield wins the prize.   North wind-----south end of the lake.   Glad everything worked out ok for you.
1002715,Acountdeleted,2017-05-09 16:44:00,2562,"Just got a call from my dad up at the cottage. (Head Lake on 35 just outside of Norland). The pontoon boat is gone and the dock that it was chained to is gone as well. I'm hopeful that the high water caused the pontoon boat to pull the dock out of the water and its floating somewhere on the lake, my dad things someone couldn't remove the chain and lock and removed the whole thing.  If anyone has been in the area or sees posts of people trying to sell a pontoon boat. White cream interior seats. Maroon painting on the outside. The words 'Liese' in gold trim on the front.  Any help is greatly appreciated."
1002720,irishfield,2017-05-09 17:41:00,26272,Call the float plane base and see if it's down there! North wind today...  Number I have is 705-454-8933
1002721,Acountdeleted,2017-05-09 18:04:00,2562,Thanks irishfield. Looking into it.
1002722,Acountdeleted,2017-05-09 18:15:00,2562,Sadly no luck. The guy there said he hadn't seen it. This is not looking good.
1002726,Old Ironmaker,2017-05-09 19:14:00,8243,Not good news. What's the hull ID number?
1002736,Acountdeleted,2017-05-09 20:32:00,2562,The hull ID is : SUN11597112  Motor ID is: 1100325

1002738,Acountdeleted,2017-05-09 20:44:00,2562,"Thank you. I think the parents are doing a tour right now in the 16 foot springbok. The fact that I got the call at noon and have not heard anything, I'm a little nervous."
1002741,manitoubass2,2017-05-09 20:46:00,11391,"I hope it's just out floating jer and it's recovered.  Best wishes man  We get the same around here on the river every other year or so with high water, docks and boats floating all over. Even found staircases and picnic tables a few years back"
1002747,Acountdeleted,2017-05-09 22:43:00,2562,Thanks everyone.  Dad thinks someone stole the pontoon boat and the docks. I honestly think they are somewhere at the bottom of the lake.  Called the insurance company on the docks. $1000 deductible. Bunch of crooks.
1002757,Rizzo,2017-05-09 23:25:00,4754,Man that sucks. Hope they still find it. Check Rush Lake...maybe it made it all the way over there. The water flows that way doesn't it? Or does it flow up from Rush?

1002766,4x4bassin,2017-05-10 01:07:00,1025,"Can't believe this story , well actually I can . What the hell is this world coming too . Can't get pontoon boat off dock so what the hell , lets steal the dock and the boat Hope it has just gone a drift on you guys and you get it back soon . I would imagine it wouldn't be an easy task to steal a pontoon boat , good luck !"
1002768,DRIFTER_016,2017-05-10 01:21:00,10439,After a big storm on Nipissing we came across someones boat that broke free. I noticed it from about a mile or so away. It was a 20'+ enclosed boat like a Bayliner and just the nose was poking above the surface. I guess there was an air pocket keeping it afloat. Something similar could have happened here with the ultra high water.
1002778,Acountdeleted,2017-05-10 03:14:00,2562,"Rush only has the one culvert connecting it to head lake. Now, the head river on the other hand...... though I'm not sure it would get under the bridge. I get the feeling the dock could have rubbed a hole in one of the pontoons, or one of the many rock croppings or islands."
1002782,chris.brock,2017-05-10 04:26:00,4053, What's the brand of boat and motor? and hp of the motor? I'm guessing it's a Sunchaser/ Suzuki  Was it a nice dock that's worthy of being stolen?  Theft is out of control up there but the cops are too busy trying to nail the good people for petty crap.
1002787,Acountdeleted,2017-05-10 11:27:00,2562,Motor is a Honda 40hp.  Boat is a sunchaser.  The insurance company priced the dock out at $1600 for the two sections that were gone.
1002799,chris.brock,2017-05-10 12:40:00,4053," There's a little ghetto area by my place, it's a long shot, but I'll have a look on the weekend."
1002801,jimmer,2017-05-10 12:57:00,2730,"I feel for you, hopefully you can find it floating somewhere and get some faith back in fellow humans.  That seems like a big job to steal a pontoon boat from the water. Keep us posted."
1002807,mukluk,2017-05-10 14:54:00,196,"As Irishfield mentioned  ""north wind today"".  The dock and boat might have blown down towards Head Lake Trailer Park.   Call John and as if he has seen it.   705-454-8019"
1002808,OhioFisherman,2017-05-10 15:44:00,6623,Don't you need a special trailer to pull a pontoon boat? I guess if someone was serious about stealing one they would be prepared? The dock was a floating dock?
1002811,moxie,2017-05-10 16:04:00,1566,This has happened a lot this spring. It was stolen and I have a good idea who it was........
1002815,Carp,2017-05-10 16:18:00,1488,"Stealing a pontoon boat is hard enough to believe, but taking the dock too ! There must be another explanation.  Even if the pontoon boat was stolen, I doubt the thieves would chance sticking around long enough to take 2 sections of dock as well. ....and where did they put all those large, heavy items ? Did they show up with a flatbed trailer and fork lift ?  If it sank, it could be anywhere as the wind and waves would push it around until it disappears below the surface, but the docks ???  Might spot it from above on a sunny day (plane or drone).  Hey Moxie, if this is happening often in the area, likely the same thieves. They would need proper equipment to steal pontoon boat and docks. Might be worth the money to install cameras or at the very least, a well hidden trail camera or two."
1002819,Acountdeleted,2017-05-10 16:35:00,2562,"Thanks for the help and advice everyone. Thanks Chris for having a look.  I'm hopeful we will be able to at least figure out what happened sometime in the future.  Docks didn't float. They were aluminum with planks that could be lifted out of the middle. Seems like a lot of work, but the lake is also very shallow (15 feet max) I feel like there would have been signs if it sunk. I honestly don't know what to think. Family has written it off. Already talking to the insurance company. Looks like I'll be trying to buy a trail cam cheap or other methods of anti-theft."
