1002781,Slimbo85,2017-05-10 03:27:00,17,"so opener is just around the corner, does the water level being higher make it harder to catch fish?  I was planning on going into back bays and throwing jerk baits, do i throw that out the window if the bays are flooded?  thanks"
1002796,BillM,2017-05-10 12:22:00,17367,"Doesn't matter what the water levels are, where every they spawned, they'll still be hanging around.   You fishing above Big Chute?  Not the greatest pike water, you'd probably do much better in GPool."
1002802,jimmer,2017-05-10 13:01:00,2730,I was pike fishing recently on some flooded areas of zone 17 and the pike were smashing Williams spoons in the red devil pattern.  Make sure you have a couple of them in the medium size.  They out fished every other lure we tried.
1002804,PUMP KNOWS,2017-05-10 13:23:00,937,Isn't pike open all year in zone 17?
1002821,jimmer,2017-05-10 16:36:00,2730,"yes, they are."
1002879,Slimbo85,2017-05-11 04:59:00,17,i meant zone 16 sorry guys  what kind of boat traffic are we looking at for the g pool?
1002887,Old Ironmaker,2017-05-11 06:33:00,8243,"Some of the best fishing we ever had was on the Ottawa when levels were so high we were fishing on what is usually Islands in 3 feet or less of water. The bait available to them, grubs, worms, frogs etc. that usually wasn't available must have been like a smorgasbord for both Pics and Pike. I'm talking double headers one after another. I like higher than normal levels unless the water is like mud soup. Then it can be tough but not impossible. My go to for Pike this time of year are ""Bushwhackers"" with some trailing rubber, now known as Spinner baits. You can't beat the old tried and true Red and White Dare Devil. Eppinger brand, no Chinese knock offs.  Good luck my man. Hammer em' real good.  A bit off topic, of course, can you use 2 rods per person on Georgian bay as is Lake O and Erie?"
1002906,BillM,2017-05-11 13:20:00,17367,"1 rod on Gbay, not like Ontario or Erie."
1002907,BillM,2017-05-11 13:20:00,17367,i meant zone 16 sorry guys  what kind of boat traffic are we looking at for the g pool?  I doubt there will be much traffic at all.
