1002660,Musky Plug,2017-05-09 00:42:00,398,I use Scotty brand orca rod holders. I've used them for two seasons musky fishing and for lakers with no issues. If you're looking to invest in some good ones Trojan tackle I believe it's called makes some good stuff from what I hear.
1002661,smitty55,2017-05-09 00:45:00,928,"Down East Salty Clamp-on Yep, absolutely the best. I use the Salty II with the double clamps. They will last forever.  Cheers"
1002662,Rizzo,2017-05-09 00:48:00,4754,ditto on the salty's. I have 4 bolted on my regular boat plus a clamp on model for the cottage tinny
1002664,DRIFTER_016,2017-05-09 01:30:00,10439,Have seen the Salty's fail with large lures in the past. I have a bunch of Scotty Orca's on my boat. Damn fine rod holders.
1002665,Pigeontroller,2017-05-09 01:32:00,2793,Get a hold of Dave Dutchak at Trojan Tackle. He's Burlington. Rod holders are his specialty!  http://www.trojantackle.ca/

1002671,John Bacon,2017-05-09 02:44:00,3277,Looking for a rod holder for trolling. Dont have any kind of rail mount on my boat. What kind of gunwhales do you have?  And what are you fishing for?  Down East Salties and Scotty have clamp on models.  I think Cannon and Berts have clamp on options as well.  The Down East Salties won't fit on my gunwhales; but the Scotty mounts will.  Scotty has a number of different rod holders that will fit their bases.  Their bases can also be bolted on if that makes more sense for your boat.  Mounting tracks will give you a lot of options.  Pictures of your boat would help with tips as well.

1002674,porkpie,2017-05-09 03:15:00,2521,"I have Berts, Scotties and salties.  They all work.  I have seen salties take some mega king hits on wore dipseys and never had them fail.  I've also snagged bottom badly with my standard Scotties whir bottom bouncing with pretty tight drags and while I've seen the Scotties flex something fierce they've never failed.  The Berts are nice.  I don't have a lot of miles on mine as I tend to use the Scotties for average fishing and the down Easter for wire divers. Most other trolling rods go in the rigger holders.  I've started using them for planer boards and they work well but so did my Scotties.  If I was just an average bass, pike and pickerel fisherman id probably mount standard Scottie cradle style holders and be done with it.  If you plan on trolling for salmon or Muskie then go for the salties or Berts!"
1002676,John Bacon,2017-05-09 03:33:00,3277," I have a Legend 16 Xcalibur.  Thanks for all the replies everyone, going to check those all out.  And sorry its for Musky. It doesn't look like clamp ons will work for you.  I would mount some tracks; then you can attach Berts, Cannon, Scotty, or other rod holders.  Down East Salties may require a custom bracket to be mounted on a track."
1002716,manjo39,2017-05-09 16:51:00,354,I have a Legend XCaliber as well.  I second or third Trojan - really good guy to deal with and quality product.  He will rubberize the Down East Salty to protect your rod handle if its cork.  Plus make a custom mount for you to get them attached or detached and out of way when not in use.  I use them for Muskie in the Kawartha's.
1002764,Moosebunk,2017-05-10 00:55:00,3970,Saltys or Scottys Powerlock or Orcas are good.  Trust the Strikers for muskie too.  Gunnel mounted though.  Saltys otherwise.
1002791,Andy,2017-05-10 12:06:00,330,"I have Folbes. Ordered them from the US. Cabelas (US) and Rollie and Helens had them. I have both the bigger and smaller sizes for musky. I prefer the smaller one overall. Compact and tough, doesn't rattle and it holds your average handle like TDRs nicely. If you have oversized handles like some Shakespeare Tiger rods, you need the larger size."
1002817,OhioFisherman,2017-05-10 16:32:00,6623,"I put an old style of these on my boat, it was many years ago.  http://scotty.com/product/no-231-power-lock-with-flush-deck-mount/"
1002865,b_cdot,2017-05-11 01:07:00,270,"I like my berts stuff but havent had much experience with others. I fish on my friends boat for steelhead, walleye and muskies with salties and I do find sometimes the salties are hard to pull the rod out of when you have a a crazy steelhead or a big musky thrashing. Bert's stuff is so expensive though thats the only downside. Not sure about scottys stuff, not familiar with it."

I can't understand how you guys have trouble getting the rods out of a Salty.  You just lift the rod straight up.  I've used Salties, Berts, Cannons, Scotty Quick Draws, & Scotty Orcas and I find that Salties to be the easiest to get the rod out of.  The only other holder that even comes close to the Salty for ease in removing the rod is the Scotty Orca."
1002885,Old Ironmaker,2017-05-11 06:11:00,8243,I'm a Scotty guy. Never a problem. They are mounted right in the gunnel. Easy in easy out and like others have snagged up on bottom more than once. For under 30 bucks each I don't think you can beat them.
1002969,Sinker,2017-05-11 19:32:00,8692,Agreed. They are easier to get the rod out than a rocket launcher style rod holder for sure. They can be tricky to get the rods in them if you haven't used them. My favourite rod holders though. Tough as nails.
