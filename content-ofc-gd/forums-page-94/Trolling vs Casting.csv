A weed filled lake is generally harder to troll in, trolling for walleyes in Lake Erie can be much different than trolling for walleyes up north?"

1002953,grimsbylander,2017-05-11 18:04:00,3016," It is a bit more complicated than that? Species? Waters? time of year? A weed filled lake is generally harder to troll in, trolling for walleyes in Lake Erie can be much different than trolling for walleyes up north? This was my point earlier...there's no 1 answer. The bottom line is, trolling works best when the target species is roaming...ie following baitfish. Salmon are a great example and walleye that are using weedlines or points to find baitfish. Trolling is a great technique when it's done with precision and purpose but the truth is, it gets a bad rap because most people troll when they don't know where the fish are and think driving around until they accidentally get bit is a good idea."
1002961,Sinker,2017-05-11 19:09:00,8692,Exactly!!
1002964,jimmer,2017-05-11 19:22:00,2730,I like to troll if my spots aren't producing.  Trolling covers much more water and you can always stop to cast when you locate fish.  I was pike fishing recently and we caught all the pike trolling accept for one.  I will probably try trolling for walleye this weekend just because the water is so high and the fish will probably be spread out. The switch to jigging once we locate some.
1002980,misfish,2017-05-11 20:25:00,29133,"When we are casting from the boat, we are moving pretty quick with the trolling motor. Casting like crazy covering lots of water til we find where they are, then we really work the area hard. I see no sense in moving along at a snails pace. When trolling lakers, we will cover alot of water and rework areas that we have marked a good concentration of fish. If they dont seem very active, we will plant our self's over them and jig. Not to often though, do we need to jig. I will work the baits on the riggers. Playing the chase game. One more day , then time to play with them greasers."
1003063,Hedfish,2017-05-12 15:32:00,76," It is a bit more complicated than that? Species? Waters? time of year? A weed filled lake is generally harder to troll in, trolling for walleyes in Lake Erie can be much different than trolling for walleyes up north? Oh. So say, we are trolling for pike in the spring in one of the western Kawartha lakes. What we usually do (without much success) is move on our trolling motor really slowly while keeping our spoons/spinners about 10 meters behind the boat. Not sure what else we could be doing there."
1003065,porkpie,2017-05-12 15:50:00,2521,"Trolling is an art.  If you want to catch pickerel, I suggest you either learn about bottom bouncing or inline weights to get you a few feet off bottom.  Another very effective way to work a weed line is to drag a small worm harness behind a walking sinker along the weed edge.  Pull it very slowly with the trolling motor, just enough to keep the blades spinning.  You can also use a slow death hook, but in the kawarthas you will catch a lot of panfish doing this.  You'll still get em on harnesses, but maybe not as much.  You can easily work structure while trolling.  You just need to mark it and fish a presentation that allows for sharp turns and rapid adjustment.  A bottom bouncer or a 3 way rig trolled rod in hand and I can cross a piece of structure many times and work every inch of it. If I was trolling a plug with 100 feet of line out, it's not so easy.  Again, many people consider trolling just throwing the junk in the water and waiting until you find fish.  Sometimes (not always) on the Great Lakes that is all that it is.  Most smaller feature packed lakes, and you will find specific areas that hold fish and then you need to pick away at them.  It's not for everyone, but if you figure it out it can be very productive."
1003068,fishindevil,2017-05-12 16:06:00,6254,dead on the money porkpie......its an artform when you perfect it...I use all what you described above and more as well...it can take big fish sometimes when nothing else can.......
1003069,Old Ironmaker,2017-05-12 16:21:00,8243,"Whom ever ""owns"" the boat decides.   I would say that you aren't letting enough line out for starts. At 10 meters your lure is close to the prop wash that will effect the swim of the tackle and may spook fish. Now on the other hand if you are trolling for Musky you ""might"" want your presentation in the prop wash. Like has been said here ""it all depends"", many things to consider. A Dipsy simply takes the lure to the side of a boat and controls depth. They are not only for big lake longlining. Invest in a few ""mini"" Dipsy's, I don't know why more inland lake guys like on the Kawartha's don't use them. The small ones are about 2"" in diameter, not sure the number 1 or 3.  Speed is so important in trolling I can't stress it enough. But what speed, 1.5 miles an hour, 3 or 4 MPH, or anything in between. Before you let line out, don't cast the line out let it out beside the boat. I don't know how many times I trolled with a bait that wasn't tracking properly because a hook or swivel was fouled up. Before you let the line out let enough line out where you can see how the plug or spinner etc. is tracking in the water. If you like it look at your speed, if it doesn't look right adjust your speed. A ruke of thumb here longlining on Erie for Pics and Trout is 1.5 to 2.0 MPH for worm harnesses, for minnow baits and spoons 2.3 to 3 MPH, of course that all depends on what the fish want. Play with speeds and when they hit make note of your speed. Don't pick a speed and stay with it, change it up, speed up, looks like a bait trying to get away from a predator, slow down, looks like an injured baitfish. Make subtle turns, zig zag, stop the engine and put it back in gear. I have never seen baitfish go in the exact same direction for long periods of time and maintain the same speed. Think like a baitfish and think like a predator fish. Trolling isn't going for a boat ride."
1003081,Hedfish,2017-05-12 17:33:00,76,"Damn, trolling sounds complicated! Thanks, guys, I will try to experiment with it this spring/summer.  Man, and I thought what could be simpler than trolling - just throw out your spoon, slow down and eat something."
1003082,Old Ironmaker,2017-05-12 17:41:00,8243,You can do that too. It's called a boat ride.
1003086,OhioFisherman,2017-05-12 18:10:00,6623,"Oh. So say, we are trolling for pike in the spring in one of the western Kawartha lakes. What we usually do (without much success) is move on our trolling motor really slowly while keeping our spoons/spinners about 10 meters behind the boat. Not sure what else we could be doing there.  LOL, please don't take me as an expert, I have never fished anywhere in Ontario before the June bass opener, and the waters I have fished there as destinations are extremely limited, the Kawartha lakes never made it on the list.  Water depths? Pike spawn early, if you are familiar with the lakes? look for areas that may be spawning areas for them or with early weed growth. Shallow coves, bays, flats with deeper water access, my idea would be to keep a lure running just above the weeds or shallower areas, with cooler water temps they probably haven't moved to far from them after the spawn.  A spinner or spoon doesn't seem like a bad choice of lures, but mixing in crankbait or lure that has a defined running depth might not hurt?  Our northern pike fishing is very limited here in Ohio, there are areas off of Lake Erie were I had a reasonable expectation of hooking one in April and early May, but as soon as the water started to warm they were gone."
1003087,OhioFisherman,2017-05-12 18:16:00,6623,"Damn, trolling sounds complicated! Thanks, guys, I will try to experiment with it this spring/summer.  Man, and I thought what could be simpler than trolling - just throw out your spoon, slow down and eat something.  LOL, that used to be Walleye fishing on Lake Erie! Head out to the island of floating boats, they had already located the schools of fish, dial in the proper depth, place your rod in the rod holder, and eat a sandwich while waiting for a hit."
1003088,grimsbylander,2017-05-12 18:28:00,3016,"Technically, trolling ""should"" catch more fish that casting. The bait spends more time in the water and if done correctly, in the right area of the water column. The ifs and buts are in the fishermans ability to execute."
1002843,LittleWorm,2017-05-10 20:26:00,122,"Just wanted to see what everyone opinion is on trolling vs casting for pike and walleye. I myself seem to have better luck casting ( maybe that's because I do most of my fishing from shore ) then trolling. Even when I am in the boat with my dad I am casting ahead of it. My dad on the other had will only troll, he does not believe in casting in any way.  It has led to may arguments when we are in the boat together. I guess eves very old school about things, has to be trolling and pretty much will only use spoons ( red and white and the silver red eye ) . I believe both have their place but in the end I do think casting is better, you have more control over your line and can react better I think.  I'm bored at work so I just wanted to see what experienced ( and not so experienced ) fishermen think.  Eric  P.S I had posted this by mistake in the wrong section. On my phone at work and I have stubby sausage fingers."
1002845,mike rousseau,2017-05-10 21:28:00,4661,For me on the river here trolling is more effective but casting or jigging is more fun  If I have to catch I troll
1002846,porkpie,2017-05-10 22:00:00,2521,"I troll for pickerel about 70 percent of the time.  It's very effective, the rest of my time is spent vertical jigging or casting husky jerks in the spring.  If you become a competent troller you can become very effective at catching pics (and plenty of bonus pike). But it's not just chucking a daredevil over the side and calling it good!"
1002848,Governator,2017-05-10 22:16:00,879,"I find trolling rather boring but find it more successful during the day. If I'm going for the morning bite, I prefer drift casting over weed beds."
1002849,lookinforwalleye,2017-05-10 22:31:00,4399,Listen to your Father grasshopper!!!!
1002850,manitoubass2,2017-05-10 22:41:00,11391,"Casting for me, 95% of the time.  I know the structure etc im looking for and can pick off specific areas of said structure.  If I was on huge water bodies, I'd probably change my tune real quick though  Only time I've trolling is if we need a quick lunch and aren't doing shore lunch"
1002851,misfish,2017-05-10 22:41:00,29133,"When I know and only know, the bite is trolling, Im trolling by rowing or bumming a ride on a real boat. BUT, when I know, and only know, the bite is from just out from shore, Im casting or jigging or just dead sticking. Thats only if I know. If I dont, I just follow Terry. LOL   Having a toon is so much fun, and takes the shore thing out of the equation. Find a spot, drop it in, and away you go.   You say your a big guy, but that dose not mean you got to be stuck on shore. I was a boat guy. No more boats for me, so when I found that fishing from a toon was so much fun, well, I fish from a toon now.  Search them, you might just find yourself, floating about and enjoying just like me,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,, oh and Terry,,,,,,,,"
1002853,Raf,2017-05-10 22:53:00,3495,fish hold in spots where trolling is ineffective and fish hold in spots where casting is ineffective  pick the method for the spot.  it's hard to beat the amount of water you can cover trolling.  it's hard to beat how well you can pick apart a spot casting
1002854,Terry,2017-05-10 22:59:00,14456,f i know the spot to fish...jig if i know an  area...cast if i am searching...troll
1002857,Musky Plug,2017-05-10 23:36:00,398,I also fish with a buddy who is like you dad and likes to troll constantly. I believe that every situation is different so you need to decide which is best.
1002861,b_cdot,2017-05-11 00:07:00,270,"Such a hard answer for that one. I prefer whatever one catches more fish some applications is casting, jigging, drifting but great lakes walleyes trolling is the only way to go!"
1002862,OhioFisherman,2017-05-11 00:10:00,6623,"Depth control and keeping a lure in the strike zone was pretty easy on Lake Erie years back, trolling a wiggle wart or hot n tot for walleye was usually the way to go, it also worked for finding smallies on Erie. If you're fishing an 8 - 10 mile section of rocky bottom do you really want to make a million casts to locate them if you don't have to?  Used to catch a lot of pike trolling up north."
1002867,GBW,2017-05-11 01:33:00,8460,"f i know the spot to fish...jig if i know an  area...cast if i am searching...troll Same. However Eric you and your father are are covering the best of both worlds at the same time.  I don't troll often at all because I have my areas and key spots.  Also the spots I go to the weeds come up to about 7"" to 12"" from surface to top of weeds even in 14' of water"
1002868,kickingfrog,2017-05-11 01:37:00,8333,"I'd rather catch fish casting, but I know that when it's done right trolling of often more effective. Your lure is at the proper depth the whole time versus a cast where part of the retrieve is getting the lure down to the correct depth and then part is the lure coming up again and then you cast it again. But again, for me, I'm out to enjoy myself and I don't solely measure that in fish caught. We do troll, but often it's to move to another casting spot, take a break or eat."
1002869,kickingfrog,2017-05-11 01:40:00,8333,"Another point to consider is that back in the day, good casting reels just didn't exist the way they do now, so you either still fished or dragged line."
1002873,SirCranksalot,2017-05-11 02:36:00,3291,f i know the spot to fish...jig if i know an  area...cast if i am searching...troll That's it in a nutshell!
1002875,Rizzo,2017-05-11 03:32:00,4754,"Most of my fishing is done for muskies on L St Clair. Since the people I take are usually pretty new to musky fishing no way am I gonna cast! Couple rookies launching giant baits is not good for my health. Plus in L St Clair you can have 2 lines per person. With three guys in a boat, trolling 6 lines off planer boards, it works out pretty effective most days"
1002877,scuro2,2017-05-11 03:40:00,904,"""Cold"" fishing troll, ""hot"" fishing cast."
1002878,LittleWorm,2017-05-11 04:21:00,122,"Thanks for the info guys. Guess I can't really show my dad this post and say "" see, told you I was right "" bu then again he can't really say that to me either. I guess each situation is different. I think want really grinds my gears is when we are trolling and there are fish on the fish finder, he trolls by once and if he does not get a bite he just leaves . To me trolling through a bunch of fish once and moving on if you do not get a bite on the first try is not really good."
1002886,Old Ironmaker,2017-05-11 06:18:00,8243,"Yes Siree. Troll to locate then cast away to your hearts content. This time of year trolling for Pike can be snaggy where Mr. and Mrs. Pike are sunning them selves in shallow water.  Now when you get to be as old as your Dad and I ask me then, well I probably won't hear you, why old fellas like trolling? Especially when casting those bricks the Essox guys call lures."
1002891,msp,2017-05-11 11:37:00,1336,My buddy and I do a technique I call strolling. He loves to troll and I prefer casting. I stand in the front and cast the shoreline while he sits on his ass and trolls. Very low speeds. When I need a bit more time on a piece of structure he puts the boat in neutral or turns off the trolling motor. I get a couple extra casts in on said piece of structure and we continue on. We both catch fish. Very effective way of fishing. Cover lots of water.
1002892,floater,2017-05-11 12:13:00,220,Whom ever is running the boat decides! The passenger should be ready for both.
1002893,AKRISONER,2017-05-11 12:26:00,5558,"im sure on some lakes and areas trolling eyes is the most effective, especially during the summer with planer boards etc etc...you also cant argue against the water you get to cover...however, if you know an area well enough, its hard to say that trolling will produce more than a pickerel honey hole.  Drop shotting has provided 20  fish an hour multiple times, i just dont think thats possible trolling."
1002896,grimsbylander,2017-05-11 12:40:00,3016,"There's no right answer here. They're two completely different techniques that when used correctly, will outshine the other. Go tell a salmon guy on the Great lakes to start casting, or a bass fisherman in the pads to troll? Oh and when I'm in new water and have no spots, the LAST thing I would do is troll. Trolling is non-specific enough without adding the element of vast unknown water. Use visual land structure and charts and if you find fish are scattered on certain features including an area in the water column, troll away if you wish. But as a search tool? Not for me."
1002899,BillM,2017-05-11 12:45:00,17367,"im sure on some lakes and areas trolling eyes is the most effective, especially during the summer with planer boards etc etc...you also cant argue against the water you get to cover...however, if you know an area well enough, its hard to say that trolling will produce more than a pickerel honey hole.  Drop shotting has provided 20  fish an hour multiple times, i just dont think thats possible trolling.  More then possible trolling, again it all depends on the lake, time of year and what structure the fish are holding against.  When those walleyes are tucked into the weed edges, you won't find a better approach then trolling those edges with harnesses, etc.    You could drop shot, but you'd be covering so much less water."
