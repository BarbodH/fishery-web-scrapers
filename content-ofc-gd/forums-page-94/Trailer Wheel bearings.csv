Grimsby I was able to identify the exact bearings and races I needed by providing my VIN to EZ loader via the phone in washington.  I then went to princess auto last night and got the bearings...  Side note I wanted to get a race and seal driver set, princess auto had one listed for 60 bucks. So after working with 3 guys to find the 60 dollar kit it turned out that their inventory was messed up and they had none in stock. The stockboy then suggested that he could take a look at the last sale price on the $120 kit just to see what he could do for me...i guess they had them on clearance because I got the 120 kit for 50 bucks! sweeeeeet.  I tried everywhere to find a Hub that would match as this seemed like a logical option but I could guarantee fitment so i went with the bearing swap option.  I will let you guys know how it goes on Friday!"

The second wheel after a smooth installation of the first.  Punching the race in with a race punch tool, whack whack crack and the piece of the hub shatters and goes flying off.  More research, i figure i can simply replace the hub. I make a run and buy a hub, go to install...the nut wont fit on...this isnt right...oh look at that our hub is 4 inches when the old one is 3.5...a ``short hub`` as they call it.  tow the boat home on a broken hub sketchy...its now in georgetown. i make some calls today...ya the hubs dont exist anymore...gotta replace the entire axle now. 1 week turnaround if you can bring the axle into them.  So ya im renting a boat in alabama and my boat is now stuck in the gta...great.  someone tell my old man, you dont try to fix whats not broken.

1002085,AKRISONER,2017-05-01 12:57:00,5558,"hey sterling  the races are universal for the 1 and 1 1/16 axle...the bearing size is what you have to watch. If you have a 1 1/16th axle you need to L4469 bearing, if you have a 1 inch axle you need a L44643 bearing.  The seals are also size specific. I cant remember the product code as the packaging had it printed on the front of the package.  Honest opinion here, if you dont require a short hub, go and buy the standard canadian tire trailer hub, its a cheaper and easier way of doing the whole process, for literally the same price and this way you dont have to pound the races in and out.  I broke my hub trying to put the races in and I was even using the proper tool for it. The races come pre installed in the new hubs, my kit even came with bearings but unfortunately I had the 1 1/16th axle so the bearings didnt fit. I ended up spending just as much on bearings as I did for the whole Hub, races, bearings, and pins.  We finally got our new short hub this weekend and the job was a 10 minute fix."

Definitely a very straightforward job except one catch...how in the heck do i determine what size bearings I need.  Ive swapped the wheel bearings and hub assembly on a car before, simple, you just order the right one for your car. But for a trailer how the heck am I supposed to be able to determine the size. I guess if worst comes to worst I could just rip them out and take them somewhere to size match them but that really reduces my window to be able to get them before I leave on my trip.  Does anyone know if there is a stamp on the hub assembly, or a way to tell what size wheel bearing I need perhaps the bearing buddy size is an indication?  Sorry if this question is stupid I am just a total noob when it comes to trailers. The trailer is an 93-94 EZ loader. Single axle for a 16-17 foot fibreglass boat. If that helps?"

His logic and rightfully so, is that by the time you feel a bearing has failed while driving; the inner race of one of the bearings is likely welded itself to the spindle. You're not getting that off, while on the side of the road; not unless you have torches and grinders. Changing the axle, means undoing 4 u-bolts, dropping the old and stuffing the new axle in. My shop is right off the 401, here in London and I see a lot of bearings failures during the summer. I'm also only 10 minutes from Princess Auto where I can buy a 3500 lb axle for around $250.00, complete with hubs. Usually a half hour to swap it out, using my shop equipment.

Hey Drifter,  I looked through EZ loader's entire line of trailers and I at least found some info relating to the weight capacity and the size of trailer  I know the approximate size of the trailer is 14-17foot as we measured the max length of boat it would haul.  it appears that the axles on these trailers are all 2000 series? if the weight capacity is 2350 would that matter re:axle size? or is a 2000 a 2000.   I also was able to confirm that they are all 5 bolt and I was able to get the bolt pattern so I am getting close!  So what I know is that the max length is definitely 17, its definitely adjustable and I 100% know that its a spring and not torsion model.  I also now have the VIN number, hopefully someone at EZ loader can give me a hand identifying what size hubs are on the trailer *fingers crossed*  "

They charged something like 35 USD an hour and not $115.00 that Crappie Tire does the last time I used them to do the brakes for less than 1/2 the price when I was forced to on the way to Myrtle Beach. Poor planning, my bad but I ended up saving money. I bet the bearings are a portion of the price. I wouldn't risk screwing the job up and stuck on the side of I-75 with a melted wheel. Not Rocket Science but I wouldn't risk ruining a trip."
