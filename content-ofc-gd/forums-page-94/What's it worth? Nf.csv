1002413,ketchenany,2017-05-05 21:35:00,3229,"I'm not a tree hugger by any means  but why send it to a land fill for the next 50 years or so? Can't it be recycled in any way? I had a couch to get rid of and I took it apart for garbage day, springs got taken, some wood I used and the cloth went to the garbage which have decomposed hopefully! Canada is way too extravagant on what we throw out when there is need elsewhere.  many years ago when we had our first daughter  we were asked  to participate in a formula study. All delivered at home as long as we reported how our daughter was handling it, it was perfect! And we got cases of it. When she was off of it they we asking for a famine donation in Africa. I asked it they would take the cases I had (no expiry date) and ship it over to them. NO we need cash! Sorry for asking!"
1002419,Old Ironmaker,2017-05-05 23:18:00,8243,"Ketchin, I am going on 63 years old, hopefully. I can remember being around 5 and my Mother telling me to eat my peas because children in Africa are starving. We obviously have not been doing much good in the last 58 years with the Africa famine problem. What is the definition of insanity again?  It will only cost Lucas 15 bucks minimum where we are to go to the land fill, which is really a fine recycling depot. Takes me 20 minutes to dump my 1/2 ton truck of stuff in all the proper bins, and fuel for him to go 25 minutes drive to it and return. No wonder people here dump all there crap on the side of the road every garbage day. I caught a guy dumping his living room in front of my place a while ago. I was almost charged with threating death, long story, good ending. Let the township take it there is what most do."
1002420,leaf4,2017-05-05 23:22:00,2466,I'll hang onto it and give it to my brother or my dad for what it's worth. Unless someone's interested in it on Kijiji or offers me a case of beer of course! ?
1002425,Old Ironmaker,2017-05-05 23:36:00,8243,"You are going to sell it to your Dad or Brother for what its worth? Wow, nice. I gave my brother a car for his 16th B Day and my father and mother a condo for their 70th.  edit, in Florida.  edit again, I must be an idiot."
1002433,leaf4,2017-05-06 00:19:00,2466,"Lol not sell it to them, give it to them if they want it that is, using for what it's worth meaning if it's going to be a hassle to sell, I'm sure one of them would want it"
1002456,Big Cliff,2017-05-06 08:24:00,6899,Over the years I've found/been given many lawn mowers/trimmers..... that people no longer wanted for a variety of reasons. The ones that could be fixed up (reasonably) I fixed and sold basically for the cost of repairs which in many cases was only a couple of bucks.  The ones that weren't worth fixing I would tear down for parts and any scrap I would take to the local scrap yard where I would get a couple of $ for it (usually about enough to cover the cost of my gas to get it there) but at least it wasn't going to land fill.  You could just put it out beside the road and someone that collects scrap metal will likely pick it up.
1002485,ketchenany,2017-05-06 23:58:00,3229,"Cliff and I are in the same boat recycle whatever we can. There  is a woman moving this weekend across the street and she has put more stuff on the curb than you can imagine and it will rot! Why not call a habitat for humanity or similar places. Brainlees IMO? Some one took a wicker chair and left four high back dining room chairs!  Again,  we are not reusing enough!"
1002486,leaf4,2017-05-07 00:17:00,2466,I got someone picking​ it up tomorrow $50 ?
1002495,manitoubass2,2017-05-07 01:18:00,11391,Good stuff guys!  Im all for recycling. If it doesn't NEED to be in a landfill it shouldn't be!
1002500,dave524,2017-05-07 10:41:00,4508,"Just did some spring cleaning, they recycle everything here, get a lot of practice backing up the trailer for separate bins for household waste, scrap metal, wood, cardboard, separate spot for and old flatscreen and laptop, of course hazardous goes to a separate building and then the brush pile and separate pile for leaves and grass clippings. Free compost this time of year   .  I really doubt a mower would end up landfill, and new Ford maybe"
1002514,Rizzo,2017-05-07 16:11:00,4754,"There are people everywhere that recycle these kind of things. When I was in Barrie I did a funeral for a man who lost his wife...he mentionned what he did (collect and sell scrap). A couple weeks after the service I dropped off a lawnmower for him to scrap. A few years later unfortunately that man also died...when I met the rest of the family and told them the story, they mentionned how their father had often talked about the funeral director that dropped off a lawnmower for him! Thought that was really neat...so whatever you do...not the landfill...find your local guy who does this stuff and give it to him."
1002238,leaf4,2017-05-03 21:31:00,2466,"So as I'm leaving work today​ I noticed a newer looking lawnmower near the dumpster... Ask around, one of the office guys was getting rid of it and couldn't throw it in himself so I thought whatever maybe it's not working and just needs a quick once over so I loaded it up. Threw some gas and oil in it when I got home and it fired up first shot and works perfectly!  Only thing is it's got some rust on the back corner close to the left tire. Probably going to pop rivet the sides together as there's a 1"" gap, now I just don't know what it's worth really  If the picture doesn't make it out, it's a Murray 22"" cut pro series with a 6.5hp engine   Any input is appreciated thanks!"
1002240,Fisherman,2017-05-03 21:38:00,7201,"It's priceless, I picked up one that was 3/4 of the way into the dumpster.  The owner didn't realize you can't hang 4 strokes up by the handle.  Well over the winter the oil drained into the cylinder,  needless to say couldn't be pulled over.  Took it home, pulled the plug, drained all the oil via the spark plug hole,  refilled and it's my campground mower, best and cheapest I ever got."
1002241,Old Ironmaker,2017-05-03 21:38:00,8243,Good score. My wifes mower that was new last April won't start today. I have never seen a mower without a manual choke or primer. I hop she can get it running before this grass grows any higher. I will need to get her a goat. I bet it has a 1 year warranty. How much do you really want for it Lucas? You aren't far from me. I'll give you 50 bucks for driving it from work to home and delivering it to the lake.
1002243,moxie,2017-05-03 21:46:00,1566,Ask $100 and take no less than $50. Didn't cost you anything.
1002244,leaf4,2017-05-03 21:49:00,2466,It does need a gas cap and an oil cap/dipstick combo so I have to search those out but I don't expect them to break the bank lol  And OI if you have a mower that's a year old why would you want this haha.  If only I found this a month ago. I just picked up a Toro recycler haha
1002251,ketchenany,2017-05-03 22:10:00,3229,"Good score. many years ago my gas mower's handle was rusting and flimsy. After a neighbourhood garage sale someone put one it the local plaza dumpster, I took it for the handle and find it electric and working! I adapted a charger and had it for 4 years!  MY neighbour tossed a brand new snowblower! I took it and was going to give it to Cliff. After chatting with him I put tubes in the tires replaced the float had the carb cleaned, changed the oil and sold it for $350.00. I had one. I guess it was not stored for winter and when it wouldn't start after the first season he left it in the shed.  Some people give up too quick!"
1002252,LittleWorm,2017-05-03 22:19:00,122,It's amazing what people will just throw out.
1002254,leaf4,2017-05-03 22:43:00,2466, I figured I'd at least have to put in a little elbow grease on it
1002255,leaf4,2017-05-03 22:46:00,2466,Also if it's new from April last year I would hazard a bet that it's under warranty (depending on brand) most come with a 2-3 year warranty from what I've seen
1002259,ketchenany,2017-05-03 23:02:00,3229,"Lucas, I learned quick, storage is the key and use premium gas only! like I said some people don't know and just go buy another. I see stuff that can be used if only people would call and have it picked up , but most of the time it's landfill. So sad. I bought my first snowblower in 1989 and it still looks and runs like new.  I'm now on a project to unplug a inkjet printer, if I fail I'll recycle it, if it works I will have two printers. But I will have another learning g curve undear my belt."
1002260,manitoubass2,2017-05-03 23:03:00,11391,Not sure how it is now? But 10 years ago in grande prairie you could furnish a house EASILY with items people leave when they move.  No joke people make a living flipping this stuff
1002262,Rizzo,2017-05-03 23:13:00,4754,I just picked up a lawnmower like that at a garage sale for 70.00 (and that included a wagon for the kids!)
1002263,LittleWorm,2017-05-03 23:48:00,122,Not sure how it is now? But 10 years ago in grande prairie you could furnish a house EASILY with items people leave when they move.  No joke people make a living flipping this Where I live if you scour the streets on trash day you can pretty much furnish a place with things you can find  that have been thrown out in the trash.
1002267,Old Ironmaker,2017-05-04 00:28:00,8243,I don't have one T.L. does and it won't start so I sell her that one for a hundred.
1002269,Old Ironmaker,2017-05-04 00:36:00,8243,"They still do out here in Haldimand. It's cheaper to leave crap behind than to rent a truck and pay by the kilo to dump it at land fill even when the landlord holds back security. It happened to me before I sold a rental property 25 years ago in Hamilton's North end. The guy was a crap picker it cost me twice the security deposit to haul it away. I was actually there when he gave me the key back and I asked him what about that yard full of crap, he laughed, told me to keep the security and begged me to slap him. I really can't believe I didn't 25 years ago. The start of my enlightened journey from the dark side"
1002272,manitoubass2,2017-05-04 00:48:00,11391," People were coming and going constantly.  They wouldn't even put it in the garbage area. Just carry it outside and leave it.  I could only imagine what ""movers"" would be able to stake claim on  I snagged a brand new sectional and a lil flatscreen myself when I first got there and had nothing lol. 3 bedroom appartment with a mattress, duffel bag (served as a pillow too) and like $30 worth of Walmart pots and pans."
1002274,Old Ironmaker,2017-05-04 01:02:00,8243,"You had an apartment and a duffel bag plus pots and pans? Must be nice. I used to eat out of old Jiffy Pop tin plates, and cook on them if I had something to cook. You Kids were spoiled."
1002278,manitoubass2,2017-05-04 01:12:00,11391,"Yeah buddy! It was awesome! Left the money in the bank and with my family, went 100% frugal when I started as a safety supervisor. Was a horrible two weeks but then I got a company credit card gas card and a vehicle and I was ballin lol.  The memories. What's for breakfast lunch and dinner??? Bread and bologna, 3 minute noodles, and entertainment was a newspaper.  It's funny to look back on. One thing I laugh at now, is scoring that tv. Well I couldn't hook it up, I had no money. One day I snagged a entertainment stand and plugged it in.  Turns out the cable wasn't turned off, and I had full HD hahahaha. Wasn't too funny at the time but Jesus. Looking at newspapers for 2 weeks got real old after about 10 minutes.  I would do so much extra work at that job with the intent of coming home exhausted so I could sleep. I didn't have blinds, and we'll summer up there is pretty much light 24/7.  It was like a weird form of torture camp I put myself in lol"
1002281,Triton Guy,2017-05-04 01:23:00,8,I would settle for $50 as it didnt cost you anything.  Cheers  TG
1002337,Rattletrap2,2017-05-05 00:27:00,1652,"I got my ""camp"" lawnmower in a similar way. The guy was hauling it up to the garbage bins when he stopped to say hello. I asked him what the story was and he said the pull start rope was broken and he had bought a new one. I told him to leave it with me and saved him the trip. That thing worked great for me for many years! I am always amazed at what some people will toss out for scrap. Being a ""horder"" of sorts is a curse and a blessing at the same time."
1002348,ch312,2017-05-05 02:20:00,1590,"I highly doubt you'll get $150-200 for that push mower, especially with a rivet repair job on an area that's stressed every time you push down on the handle to turn the mower. Maybe get half of your assessed value?   "

1002400,Mister G,2017-05-05 19:00:00,1429,Correct me if I'm wrong but a Murray is at the very low end of lawn mowers so I would ask $75 and be very happy if I got $50.  Good Luck with the sale and buy some fishing stuff with the profits.....
1002404,leaf4,2017-05-05 19:22:00,2466,"Thanks, never heard of the brand before myself lol figured there was enough intelligence to draw from here to get some opinions ?"
1002412,Old Ironmaker,2017-05-05 21:17:00,8243,"The 50 buck offer is off the table. The MTD that won't start is under warranty and I am going to bring it into the local MTD authorized repair guy that I actually know and fishes with me once and a while, small world. I found the receipt and paid $199.99 for new with a 2 year limited warranty. My offer is 25 bucks now Lucas including a new gas cap and dip stick. You are going to pay 15 bucks to take it to land fill 25 miles away to Dunnville. Next time you see one, leave it there. I've been where you are before."
