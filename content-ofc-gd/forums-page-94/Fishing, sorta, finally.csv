Well today, after being released from the hospital, I went to the RRFN dock with my mom and daughter, full cripple style.  My gawd was it nice to wash some lures!  Unfortunately you could see where the pike would be, by the sucker spawn, and on crutches that wasn't accessible.  But I did manage two hours of casting from a chair on the dock. Missed 6 or 7 bites. Had sunshine(and heavy winds) but man was that the therapy I needed!  Being injured can take you to a dark place, and a simple fish was uplifting to the point words cannot describe!  Hopefully better weather tomorrow and I can get right back out!  Lots pelicans and some great scenery, a lil windburn, and the realisation my shore tackle is a disaster, made for some great times!  And of course, our lil lilybugs came with and was full of tales to tell Grandma! My mom's first time watching the lake sturgeon surface too! She was in heaven. ""No wonder you spend so much time down here"" were her words  Thanks for reading!        "
