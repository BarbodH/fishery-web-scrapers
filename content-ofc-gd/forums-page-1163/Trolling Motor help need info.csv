The plug assy and the foot controller for a 15 year old unit is going to be hard to find and more than what it will be worth. After 15 years the technology has improved so much that it will be heavier and slower than you want. Added all together you will have about half the amount of money into the antique as a new nice basic model that will give you many years of life.   Art

104399,addict,2007-08-16 18:47:00,475,"you guys are right.this would have been a quik fix,but the money tied up in in would pay for part of the new one.just cant afford the new one this season and i cant fish another day in my rig without a motor cant wait till my friend gets back from the rock and i can fish in his rig till i ge mine.was looking into the edge bow mount line up anybody got feed back on these,from my understanding they are the meat and taters not as fancy as the maxum series."
