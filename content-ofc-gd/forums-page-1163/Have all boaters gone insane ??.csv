103915,Gerritt,2007-08-15 02:30:00,6129,   Ohhh my dang god!!!...   There is a HUGE difference between the Constitution and the Constitutional Act....   a HUGE difference!  Gerritt.
103916,canadianguy33,2007-08-15 02:31:00,121,"lol. Garritt....buddy...you're really reaching if the best you can come back with is that Canada doesn't have a constitution.  I mean, are you serious, because your remarks seem kind of thrown together in a half witted manner.  Do you really want me to give you the Webster's definition of the word?   Okay, prove it.  You've made the claim so the onus is on you.    Just because emotions often do override the law doesn't make it right.  I mean, have you ever heard of conflict of interest?  There's a reason such precedent has been set.  I'm pretty sure it dates back to Hammurabi's code even. lol   Where do you come up with this stuff?  Out of thin air I presume?  The fact is that the Canadian government is under no obligation to provide compensation to unlawfully persecuted persons.   Nor do people that receive non-guilty verdicts receive any monetary compensation regardless of whether or not they were imprisoned.  Also, I do see mandatory insurance as a sentence.  If, by your logic we can appeal and win the lotto then I assume I'll be able to ask the insurance companies for my money back after twenty years without making a claim and swearing I'll never drive a boat again. lol"
103920,POLLIWOGG,2007-08-15 02:40:00,835,"I'm with the canadianguy on this one, If you know what your doing on the water the need for insurance is limited to bumps and scrapes  around the dock or protection from the other uninsured guy that doesn't know what he's doing. Unfortunately  you can't just get liability you have to get a package that puts you in with the guys that rip their outdrive off   every year.  If you run over a swimmer that doesn't have a flag with him its not your fault as long as you keep a proper look out so your insurance won't pay out on it anyway.  I can also tell you for fact that mandatory insurance is coming, my guess is within 5 years."
103922,canadianguy33,2007-08-15 02:50:00,121,"  Well, who are you to define what's responsible and what's not?  Just because you have kids doesn't mean that your rights are greater than people that don't have kids.  That's a fact by the way.  Not an opinion.   Well, you do know that there's a risk when you're walking the streets right?  I hope you haven't went your entire life thinking that it's not possible. I mean, I had 200 neighbors last year that were mowed down on the sidewalk.   So, if you don't want to risk being mowed down then you shouldn't leave your house and whatever you do, DON'T WALK ON THE SIDEWALK!   Being ""irresponsible"" and impeding on another person's freedoms are two very different and distinct things.  Being ""irresponsible"" is subjective, impeding on another person's freedoms is CRIMINAL."
103923,Gerritt,2007-08-15 02:55:00,6129,"From Websters....   Constitution Noun  1. Law determining the fundamental political principles of a government.  2. The act of forming something; ""the constitution of a PTA group""; ""he still remembers the establishment of the hospital"".  3. The way in which someone or something is composed.  4. United States 44-gun frigate that was one of the first three naval ships built by the United States; it won brilliant victories over British frigates during the War of 1812 and is without doubt the most famous ship in the history of the United States Navy; it has been rebuilt and is anchored in the Charlestown Navy Yard in Boston.     CONSTITUTIONAL ACT  Specialty Definition: Constitutional Act of 1791  (From Wikipedia, the free Encyclopedia)  The Constitutional Act of 1791 was a British law which changed the government of the province of Quebec to accommodate the many English-speaking settlers, known as the United Empire Loyalists, who had arrived from the United States following the American Revolution. Quebec was divided in two. The western half became Upper Canada (now southern Ontario) and the eastern half Lower Canada (now southern Quebec). Upper Canada received English law and institutions, while Lower Canada retained French law and institutions, including seigneurial land tenure, and the privileges accorded to the Roman Catholic church. Representative governments were established in both colonies with the creation of a legislative assembly; Quebec had not previously had representative government. Along with each assembly there was also an appointed upper house, the Legislative Council, created for wealthy landowners; within the Legislative Council was the Executive Council, acting as a cabinet for the governor.  The Constitutional Act also tried to create an established church by creating clergy reserves â€“ grants of land reserved for the Anglican Church. These reserves created many difficulties in later years.  The act was problematic for both English speakers and French speakers; the French Canadians felt they might be overshadowed by English settlement and increased rights for Protestants, while the new English-speaking settlers felt the French Canadians still had too much power. However, both groups preferred the act and the institutions it created to the Quebec Act which it replaced.      Here is some more....  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constitution  and here is another...  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constitutional_Act   There is a large difference... I am shocked you cant see it to be honest..  Gerritt.  PS... My wife with her Masters in History is shaking her head at us....   Sheesh...."
103927,canadianguy33,2007-08-15 03:02:00,121,"  O please.  Have any of you guys ever run over a swimmer?  Have any of you guys ever caused an accident that maimed or killed someone?  The FACTS and PROBABILITY say that you haven't.  Also, out of those 200 people that die every year in boating accidents, how many of those guys are to blame for their own deaths?  I'd bet my left nut that at least 50% of them caused their own deaths.  38% of those deaths involved alcohol which I assume isn't forced down their throats, so I think it's pretty safe to say that 1 in 10 die because of their own stupidity."
103929,canadianguy33,2007-08-15 03:09:00,121," There's no need to copy and paste your own definition. Here's a url for the definition of the word from the official site.  Anyways, does it really matter if my definition fits your definition.  I think the fact that you pointed to the Charter of Rights proves that you understood what I was implying.  You're grasping at straws trying to prove a point that can't be proven.  I'm challenging any and all of you to rebuke my opinion with some solid evidence or facts.  Thus far, all I've seen is emotional pleas.  P.S. I don't really care if you wife is a rocket scientist or a plumber as her status is irrelevant to the conversation.

103941,Gerritt,2007-08-15 03:33:00,6129,I should add.... that if you or anyone else would like to continue this debate... lets please take it to PM's... is it is removing from the original point of Lew's thread... or lets start a a new thread so we are not highjacking his thread and what it was meant to be about...   Sorry Lew... this has got a bit carried away...  Gerritt.
103946,canadianguy33,2007-08-15 04:01:00,121,"What do you mean ""it's removing from Lew's original point of the thread?""  If I had posted 20 posts in this thread about how other boaters had cut me off and agreed with Lew would that be acceptable?  I'd like to continue the conversation as is, with all my words and everyone else's laid out in black and white.  This thread began with a question ""Have all boaters gone insane?""  Just because you don't agree with what some people are saying is no reason to close this thread and end the conversation.  P.S. Gerritt, you've offered no facts to your argument other than your wife has a master's in history and she says we're full of poop.  I have diploma's too.  It's easy to say someone is full of it, but it takes facts to back it up.  Please prove I'm full of it."
103949,markiemark70,2007-08-15 04:07:00,158,"I vote for keeping the thread as is. Nothing wrong with healthy debate.  Canadianguy, you are contradicting yourself. You on one hand say that individual rights trump all, and at the same time, say that 38% of those boaters who died were idiots for drinking. Well if individual rights are the only rights that matter, and its ""criminal"" to impede them, then who are you or anyone else to say that those people did not have every right to get behind the wheel drunk? Don't judge them. They were just excersizing thier individual rights."
103957,canadianguy33,2007-08-15 05:19:00,121,"  Firstly, thank you for voting to keep this thread open.  I really do believe that this is an important issue we all should discuss.  I don't believe I'm contradicting myself.  My ideas of what's idiotic isn't law, nor do I think it should be. ""Idiocy"" in itself is subjective and mostly a moral judgment.  With that said, I'm about to get really unpopular and tell you that I don't entirely agree with the drinking and driving laws as they are.  Organizations like MADD would like you to believe that drinking and driving is the big killer in Canada, killing tens of thousands of people, however, the facts are that drinking and driving deaths are only about 1,000 people per year nationwide (click this link to see for yourself), which is also pretty close to the 1/50,000 boater deaths given the total driving population.  Personally, I don't believe the laws we have accurately represent the risk, and preserve the freedom a person should have to drink and drive.  Taking note from the very basis of our judicial system that 10 guilty people roam free to preserve one innocent man, a law should only be enacted if the number of people effected exceeds 10% of the population.  Now, I agree that is an extreme example.  I wouldn't wait until 3.5 million Canadians were dying in DUI accidents to enact an anti-drinking and driving law.  However, 3.3 million deaths vs the actual 1,000 deaths per year sure does put things in perspective.  Is the risk of 1/33000 really worth impeding on everyone's personal freedom?  What about 1 in 100,000?  What about 1 in 1,000,000?  Where is the line drawn?  Does anyone get what I'm saying?  You can't put the needs of a few ahead of everyone else. I mean, 1,000 people out of a population of 33 million is nothing.  **dodges flying tomatos**"
103960,JerseyDog,2007-08-15 08:41:00,190,"I have insurance on everything I own.  If you are not dirt poor, have a family to take care of or anything to lose - you should do the same.  I couldn't care less if its mandatory or not - if I get sued, the insurance company picks up the first two million which means at minimum they'll hire you a great lawyer."

103980,pigeonfisher,2007-08-15 11:55:00,696,"I think you all need something to chew on.  DANG...BEER...CHICKEN WINGS...ELITISM  I am sure that we could argue this until blue in the face; however, one point and one point only struck me during this thread.  Someone mentioned that you (Canadaguy33) likely don't have children, by many of your comments I would have to agree with that.  Strike me if I am wrong but at some point we have to take trust in our neighbour to be a better man.  If we argue over lawn cutting I trust that we will enjoy a beer the next day and not worry about him seeking revenge, if we drive on the same street I would trust that he would obey the laws of common sense and not rip along through a school zone (disregard Canadian Law for a minute).  I have confronted people on my street (I live on a corner) about the speed in which they drive blindly around the corner.  To make my point with them I usually bring Cooper (my 3 year old) with me.  They then see another side of the coin and generally wave as they drive by next time.  They weren't intentionally trying to kill Cooper, just being careless.  Now they think about it differently and picture him being around the corner when they are coming.  We have to TRUST that people are doing the right thing, and if confronted about doing ""the wrong thing"" as judged by our laws of common sense (the laws of the water are generally common sense) that they will participate in the conversation with open ears and eyes.  This thread was started as a conversation about people on our waterways that are acting inappropriately.  To that end I will bring one analogy that stems from the manufacturing sector, "" You can't inspect quality into your parts"", people have to believe in the company and the process to make things right.  In this case we can't legislate common sense onto the waterways.  I will leave you, CanadaGuy and Gerritt with one lasting remark that has changed my life.  Don't judge people by their actions, but by their intentions.  You and I expect to be judged by our intentions, when a mistake is made we always come back with ""that isn't what I meant"" or ""You have mis-understood me"".  We expect people to judge us not on our actions but on our intentions.  Take this line of thinking and ""Pay it Forward"" (the movie was on last night).  Don't guess here, if you are unclear about the persons intentions...ASK.  To the unfortunate boater that sent his kids to hospital in an act of carelessness as he threw the tube he was towing into an anchored boat...We know you didn't mean to, but please be more careful."
103983,Jer,2007-08-15 12:06:00,1426,"So only a thousand deaths with the fairly severe penalties, laws and enforcement we now have in place...  ...imagine the carnage if it was a free-for-all!  Again a contradiction, did you stop to think that maybe the death rate is so low (your opinion, not mine) is at least partially (if not mostly) due to the fact that we have such laws in place. I too would like to live in a fantasy society where everybody acts responsibly and in the best interest of others (kinda like OFC), but unfortunately, as the thread subtitle suggests, too many morons out there!  I hope your 10% rule doesn't apply to murder, that kinda makes about 3 million Canadians expendable each year..."
103988,lookinforwalleye,2007-08-15 12:15:00,4399,I vote that the mods flame this thread I think it`s all pretty much been said and we have clearly established who the wingnuts are/is.
103989,Roy,2007-08-15 12:19:00,13728,"Thanks for that, Steve. You're wise beyond your years. On that note, I think that this one has run its course."
103913,markiemark70,2007-08-15 02:26:00,158,"""Until I impede on your personal freedoms it is unconstitutional to persecute me by way of money. It's my right to be on the water. It's your choice to have kids; it's your choice to take the kids out boating. Rights win over choices every time...or at least they should.""   Obviously you don't have children, or you could'nt possibly defend that position. You are big on rights, so here's aquestion for you:  What about my right to enjoy a resource, be it road or water responsibly without some irresponsible jerk who cares about nothing but himself (if that) risking my life or others. Is there no such right?  Using your logic, I should never leave my house, because if I walk down the street and someone mows me down on the sidewalk, I should have known that there was that risk, and take personal responsibility for that.  To put a twist on your comments about the legal system, I would rather that 100 irresponsible idiots be prevented from using the water, than 1 innocent, responsible person be killed for no fault of his/her own."
103685,Seaweed,2007-08-14 15:09:00,135,"I'm going to chime in on this one....although I usually try to avoid topics like this due to the way people sometimes twist what you say into something it isn't.  Basically Lew I think we all have had those days with too many wild boaters and jet sking freaks.  What I want to add to the conversation is something I witnessed on the weekend on Mississippi Lake near Ottawa.  I was fishing a tournament there and well the traffic during the morning was slim ... most were still sleeping.  Things changed quickly though and before long boats and tubes and skiers and jet skis were soon zipping all over the place.  The prevailing winds drove everyone to sheltered bays where the fishermen were retreating to for shelter to fish but also the boaters wanted to run due to the lack of choppy water.  Long story short it made for some interesting fishing.  It wasn't until the event of the afternoon though that I noticed what I think is right along the ""Have all boaters lost their minds""  kind of behaviour.  A motor boat was drifting along on the other side of some islands we were fishing.  At first I didn't notice them thinking it was just another boat because I was concentrating on the fishing.  Then their voices and waving of paddles made me think ... hmmm is there a problem over there or were they just trying to signal someone?  The wind was pushing the boat towards the island so I didn't think much of it because there were plenty of boats on the other side of the island that I assumed would be closer and be able to help them out if they needed it.  My partner had moved the boat so we were never really sure if anyone came to the rescue of these boaters or not.  Long story short though .... Everyone has to help a boater in trouble... that is the law of the water.  My partner rationalized not going to see if we could help because we needed to get to the other end of the lake for the weigh-in and we still didn't have a limit of fish on board and we were catching fish finally... so we didn't help but it left me feeling... well not good.  So just hope that the person with the boat trouble got things sorted out and got home safely.  Anyway I guess my point would be... it wasn't too long ago that people would jump at the chance to help another boater if they saw the chance to do so.  Today things are a bit ... well less driven to do so."
103706,canadianguy33,2007-08-14 16:14:00,121," Thanks for the input Roy.  Out of curiosity I did a little searching to find some more information about boat licensing.  From the globe and mail I found:   Here's the full article  Call me crazy, but doesn't $350 million sound like an awful lot of money to spend considering the relatively small number of people of that die each year in boating accidents?"
103710,misfish,2007-08-14 16:25:00,29133,"  So Im thinking here, that you believe owners of under 16 ft are any different then those that own larger?  Ever seen a couple of drunk,n teens zip and twist and turn with acouple of 12 ft tinnys with 9.9,s on them playing dodge boat.  I  believe if it,s powered by machine,you need insurance.Will this help,probly not,but atleast everyone pays and is covered."
103769,canadianguy33,2007-08-14 18:50:00,121," lol I said I was done with this thread a couple of days ago, but I can't help ask, how is that rational?  Maybe you don't mind throwing your money away, but I do."
103770,bigfish1965,2007-08-14 18:56:00,3382,"Because some idiot somewhere is going to maim someone. If they don't have insurance,that person is stuck disabled and poor. IF they maim themselves we get to pay for them through their UI or welfare after they can't work anymore. You have insurance on your car and your home, why is a boat any different? Maybe you won't do something stupid, but someone may do it to you.  Misfish..I picked 16 ft and up as a starting point."
103772,Tarzan's Jane,2007-08-14 18:56:00,1183, This is no doubt so not worth it...but I too can't help myself.  You have issue with throwing your money away yet have so little regard for your life.  (referring to your choice to not wear a PFD and your comments regarding that.
103773,Gerritt,2007-08-14 18:58:00,6129,"I can tell you what I did... as soon as my boat was in the driveway I had it insured... It is called responsible ownership. Accidents can and do happen, I insured for just that reason... do what you wish and if a accident does happen and your being sued for a million then let us know what you think about insurance.  It is illegal to drive a car intoxicated It is illegal to drive a boat intoxicated It is illegal operate a car without insurance It should be illegal to operate a boat without insurance  Snowmobiles REQUIRE insurance unless your on your private property... <--recreational vehicle  I fail to see how your argument holds water...  Boat insurance should be mandatory on publicly navigable waterways.  I am glad to see though that most of our members believe insurance is a good thing when it comes to boating.  Gerritt.  I should add that most off-road vehicles also require insurance if driven off your private property... that includes taking an ATV into the bush etc.. or dirt biking at your local track.."
103784,tonyb,2007-08-14 19:26:00,1637,"Even worse when they crowd the area you are fishing from shore...  This is the St Lawrence seaway...I couldn't believe they were literally directly over top of where we were presenting our baits.  They would get right in front like that, drive up the river and drift back down right over top of our setup.  It was annoying since they were starting the engine up every time and blasting away, surely spooking the fish.  Ignorance is bliss...    Tony"
103785,canadianguy33,2007-08-14 19:27:00,121," Boat insurance, car insurance and home insurance have absolutely nothing to do with EI, disability or welfare.  Only 200 people of over 7 MILLION boaters in Canada die every year in boating accidents.  I don't believe the risk is justification for mandatory insurance.  Canadians already pay nearly half of what we earn in taxes.  The idea that we should be forced to hand over more money to private insurance companies (that make huge profits!) because we have a 1/50,000 chance of getting killed is Bull."
103787,wallyboss,2007-08-14 19:30:00,1095,Tony!!!  Don't you use 3 oz weights for Crap fishing.  They would've got the hint with a few of those zinging by there ears.
103791,canadianguy33,2007-08-14 19:34:00,121," O please.  Like I said before, I take a calculated risk not wearing a PFD when it's nice, there's no waves and I don't have kids in the boat.   Just like I take a calculated risk when I go snowmobiling, boating, dirt biking or walk down a dark street.  Do you guys realize that the odds of dying in a boat accident are approximately the same as being struck by lightening?  Should we all have lightening insurance too?"
103796,misfish,2007-08-14 19:38:00,29133," WOW Im thinking you have bird crap on your shoulder or your just one of those guys that will never run into a boat or a dock or god forbid, not see a swimmer in the water and hit them. Yes this may sound rash,but like they say,if it can happen, it will happen.When I had my 14ft tinny I had insurance. I believe Gerrit said it best. Thanks bro.  YOU JUST NEVER KNOW.  Just to add.  I like most DONT LIKE THE HANDCUFFING/BIG BROTHER system that the goverment is putting us under,but you got to appriciate the fact that you are more protected with the newer laws then say back in the 60,s,70,s and 80,s.

103086,POLLIWOGG,2007-08-12 15:30:00,835,One more time... the gov. gets no $ from your operators card so all of us that don't like giving our $ to the gov. should be happy with this system.  The basic crossing of 2 vessels requires both knowing their responsibilities  as stand on or give way vessels so having both got there pcoc it proves that as the one guy stated they are slightly smarter than an idiots and should miss each other.  The basics required for the pcoc don't make a good boater it just makes them less of a hazard to others.

Also, so what if some guys drive through the weeds or drive in shallow water?  What the hell does that have to do with your safety?  So what if some guys boat doesn't plane because he has his motor too low?  What does that have to do with you?   Please tell me you're kidding?  Some of you guys come off like you think that throwing money at the problem is going to solve everything, while totally disregarding the burden it places on the safe boaters.

Sad....  ---------------------------------------------------------------------  Two children have been injured, one critically, in a boating accident on Rice Lake near Harwood. The towed inner tube on which they were riding slammed into a stationary boat.  Around 3 p.m., one family group was preparing for an afternoon of tubing off Coral Cables Resort. Stationed offshore, the family group saw a second boat towing two children on a water tube approaching. At the last moment, the approaching second boat swerved to avoid collision, but the two children being towed on a water tube, a nine-year-old boy and 10-year-old girl, slammed into the stationary boat.  The two children were taken to Northumberland Hills Hospital in Cobourg with serious head injuries. The nin-year-old boy was airlifted to Sick Kids Hospital in Toronto with critical injuries"
103132,muskymatt,2007-08-12 20:35:00,2608,"  If you don't know the Ottawa river and have no gps/sonar...you better be nervous....or you won't be  boating for long.  If you have a $50,000 plus boat and go zooming around , there is a word for that....I think it's IDIOT.  Trimming your boat properly so you make less wake saves gas is less damaging on the shoreline and is  proper ettiquet as far as I'm concerned.  Personally I'd like to see an idiot or 2 take out their bottom end zipping through the weeds, then I could laugh all the way as I tow their wrecked boat back to shore where it belongs.  And as far as more money ...if it's too expensive then maybe the weekend warriors will not be able to afford it and will take their rightful spot on a golf course instead of the water."
103143,canadianguy33,2007-08-12 21:47:00,121," If you're so worried about the shoreline then why don't you quit boating altogether?  lol  I'm sure guys that are out in their boats three or four times a week with properly trimmed motors do more damage than the ""weekend warriors"" that are only on the water a half dozen times a year.   Who made you the king of the waters?  There's nothing wrong with weekend warriors.  I only get out on the water about a half  dozen times a year max and for you to suggest making boating so expensive that I should just hit the golf course instead is Bull.  I have just as much right to use the water as you."
103146,muskymatt,2007-08-12 22:19:00,2608,A little sensitive are we???  Def. not king of the water...but a concerned angler who practices what he preaches.
103161,canadianguy33,2007-08-13 00:07:00,121,"O please.  You're calling me sensitive?  I'm not whining because there are (and always will be) idiots on the water.  By the way, whether or not you practice what you preach is irrelevant to this conversation.  Just because you and I only use the water for fishing doesn't mean that everyone else on the lake should stop jet skiing and driving their big speed boats.  Just because you wouldn't  go ""zooming around"" in a $50,000 boat doesn't make that person an idiot."
103231,Guest Trophymuskie,2007-08-13 02:25:00,0,"Hey I go zooming around in a $60 000 boat but I respect others and slow down in no wake zones and will not blow by within less then 100 feet of other boats.  It my job to be out there over 100 days a year and I can see stories like the one quoted above becoming more and more common and that's just because people are ignorant. I have to keep an eye out at all times to stay alive out there.  Today I was once again cutting across the river trolling 5 MPH but the channel here was probably 1/4 mile across but this idiot in a cruiser waited until the last minute to veer off and pass within 50 feet off the back of my boat. Actually at one time as I was casting this idiot had his non experienced wife driving and she turned right into my cast, she then had to do another sharp turn and all this was withing 100 feet of me and the shoreline.  Sorry for venting but it's nuts out there, thank god I survived another weekend and I hopefully won't have to dodge anyone tomorrow."
103234,canadianguy33,2007-08-13 03:42:00,121," LOL.  For the record; I didn't join this forum to start fights, but c'mon TrophyMusky...that's a little melodramatic.  I realize that I'm writing on a fishing forum, and my opinion on this subject probably isn't going to strike a chord with hardcore anglers but for the sake of Joe-Schmoes like me I really wish you could see the other side of the coin.  I mean, would you guys seriously support some sort of regulation that charged per day?  If you had to pay a $50/day fee to go out boating would you think that was fair?  If mandatory insurance and boating licenses came into effect that's what guys like me would be paying.  The way the waters are regulated now isn't perfect, nor do I think it'll ever be perfect.  There certainly are some dicks out boating but I hardly think the problem is so bad that your average Joe should be punished for the stupidity of a few.  I really do wish I could get out on the water more often but it's just not that easy.  Going out on the lake shouldn't be made into a privilege that only some people can enjoy. However, all this crying for more regulation is going to do just that.  Anyways, I think I'm done posting in this thread."
101945,Gerritt,2007-08-08 02:23:00,6129,"I bet dollars to donuts...  the guys that are on the 400 series cutting everybody off and weaving in and out of traffic in their BMW's... are the same morons you seeing on the lakes.... they drive like jackasses on the roads... they also think the lakes belong to them too.... How many Chevettes do you hear doing 200km+ on the 400??... nope notta one... BMW's, Mercedes, Porches (sp?) etc... Oppps.... forgot my boat keys!!! Complete Bull....  Time for Cam Wolley to be on the lakes... just as much as they are on the 400...  Perhaps it is time for the OPP to look at other forms of travel then just driving.... most of the time they (opp) are the causes of gridlock... everyone slowing down etc... when EVERYONE is traveling at the same speed...  they should be looking at the water alot more then they are... I have seen 2 OPP on the water in 7 Years!... but 70000 on the 400...  I understand some will disagree... but if you want rules on the water... then put the people that can enforce the rules on the water!  Gerritt."
101989,Rich Clemens,2007-08-08 08:49:00,3131,"I'll tell ya, there's a 27+ mile long man-made lake just over the mountain from me .. in less than an hour I can be on the water.  Excellent Striper fishing from what I hear with many PA state records taken from there (I don't fish stripers).   That place is such a freeking zoo in the summer, I won't even go over there.  Jet Skis, Water Skiers, Boats just speding all over the place.  Even if I would put in a try to fish, I'd be bounced all over the place.  No thanks, I like to enjoy my fishing."
102029,Jer,2007-08-08 11:58:00,1426,"This weekend was a real doozy with boat traffic. I was out pulling a tube on Saturday and the traffic was unreal. Really had to keep a look out for people paying no attention.  My buddy on Chemong was telling me about some lady that almost slammed her 10-year-old son into his boat on waterskis. He was fishing about 20 yards from shore when this lady drives by with a boat load of kids and one on skis behind her. She passes by within about 15' (apparently on the way to her dock) and drags the skier to within about a foot of his bow. When he confronted her on her stupidity, all she could say was he shouldn't be fishing there (so close to her dock)."
102033,lew,2007-08-08 12:22:00,12767,"Hey Jer, we were fishing a favorite spot just west of you last Friday and we were driven off by all the jet-skis terrorizing the water and fishermen. I felt like I was being attacked by a swarm of giant yellow and red hornets.  You'd think with all the open water on that lake, those jack-asses could find somewhere else to play, other than 50' from a couple people trying to cast.  I think the guy that invented jet-skis should be tied to a floating raft and have 1000 of those morons spend an entire weekend screaming around him.  Maybe jet-skis are OK in the hands of normal people, but so far I haven't come across any yet."
102041,Fishingfever,2007-08-08 12:47:00,27,"I hear ya, had the same thing happen to me not to long ago."
103014,wallyboss,2007-08-12 02:43:00,1095,This same thread came up on a Fishing website from Quebec and some people posting said that it is bad in Quebec also but he mentioned that Ontarians were a lot better behaving than Quebecers were.  So I can just imagine how bad it is around Montreal.  Actually one guy posted that he was always wondering were those seadoo rider's and other idiots were when Duck season was open just to see if they would come as close when they saw somebody in the small boat with a shotgun in there lap. Nothing like a shot across the bow to make them think twice about it!!!!!!
101697,joonmoon,2007-08-07 17:00:00,528,"Hey Lew I hear ya...my wife and I decided to fish Chesley Lake up in Grey/Bruce on Sunday and as soon as church got out so did all the jerks. Jetskiers, skiers, and cruisers pullin tubers. Got swamped twice in the Crawdad and couldn't believe how close they were getting to wake us, when they had tons of room in the entire lake to rip around and burn/waste gas. We exited the guantlet as soon as the electric trolling motor would get us off the lake. Needless to say I won't be returning on a long weekend anytime soon and we left without paying the launch fee, screw them....bible camp my butt."
101703,charlesn,2007-08-07 17:21:00,551,"We have formalized testing and licensing for our roads and has already been pointed out, does it stop people from being jerks?  I don't think there is a way to cure it.  I saw a father and mother pulling a couple of tubes on the weekend.  The kids fell off, and the parents just kept on going even though many around were yelling and waving at them to slow down and turn around.  I could understand being a jerkoff but to put your own kids in danger?  Sad.  I had a spun hub at the time and could only go at 7.6 mph.  I was throwing 3-4 times the wake I normally would at WOT so I also was a magnet for the pleasure crafts wanting to jump my wake and ""impress"" me.  Oh the agony.  Normally I can jump up on plane and leave even most jetskis in the dust for some solitude.  I'd like to see a license and testing for using the boat ramps too since everyone's IQ seems to drop in half under the pressure of a busy boat ramp.  Charles"
101705,Aaron Shirley,2007-08-07 17:27:00,655,"We all feel your pain Lew.  Most of us have had bad encounters from the 'moron factor'.  Launching a Suick or lead weight may seem like a good idea at the time, but if you ever hit anyone, you will be the one charged.  I almost bit the big one years ago going through the Peace bridge area on the upper Niagara River when a 40' cigarette boat loaded with young people drinking beer came 2' from my starboard side on purpose at full throttle coming way to close to flipping my boat at one of the most dangerous areas on the river.  The worst part was that the occupants in the boat cheered when they almost flipped my boat and killed me.  I can't even begin to describe how mad I was.  A proper test to attain a boaters licence similar to a vehicle complete with a boat ride to pass is a great idea... much better than the tax grab joke of a boaters card we have now.  All boaters are legally responsible for their own wake.  Cheers,  Aaron"
101717,Headhunter,2007-08-07 18:09:00,5703,"Here's a link to a potential solution to stupidity... subtle, but effective and fairly difficult to spot... http://www.catsdomain.com/ Bell sinkers work pretty good! I suggest a quick ""waterline"" shot and problem should be solved! HH"
101719,POLLIWOGG,2007-08-07 18:18:00,835,"They started the card out with small craft because thats where the casualties are most common but why they totally ignore the #1 killer canoe is what I can't figure out. Isn't the life of a paddler worth   as much as a power boater?  Until recently most boaters worked their way up to bigger boats and took a boating coarse along the way, now you see people in big boats with no experience at all.  Buddy cruises the 1000 islands and tells me he's starting to come across boats running autohelms with no lookouts now.  At the same time you have to realize that you don't own a territory around your boat or a comfort zone or my space and as long as the boats you encounter don't endanger you by legally passing close by  they have done nothing wrong other than a lack of courtesy, and only you know what you are dragging behind your boat not the other guy so take some responsibility for it.  I know this isn't what you want to hear and I'm not saying Lew was wrong because Lew is as I know him from what I've read on this site is pretty level headed, but most sportfishers are probably the least educated boater on the water and when they tell me about how they were offended its usually because they were in the wrong."
101723,danbo,2007-08-07 18:51:00,2646,"I had a close encounter on the Credit Rivermouth the other day, same thing..a clown at 1/2 throttle thru a NO WAKE zone. I gave him an earfull..would've been a mouthfull of knuckles if I caught him ashore! Fight fire with fire, friends!!"
101725,glen,2007-08-07 18:58:00,2641,I cant get over the freak show on lake eugenia on sunday.  It has nothing to do with fishermen or skiers or jetskiers.  All boaters have to have some brain cells.  I guess these people will sleep well when they are 100% the reason that someone gets killed.  Yes they are insane.
101766,Guest Trophymuskie,2007-08-07 20:56:00,0,And I thought only on the big waters did we have these idiots. Worse thing is every time you encounter one of these idiots there is thousands of acres they can drive over instead of the one you're fishing at the time.  We have a spot on the Ottawa that is a small channel less then 100 feet from shore where by law they should slow down but even when there are boats fishing they don't blink and eye a fly right by less then 100 feet from shore and less then 50 feet from boats. I wonder if a cop was to sit there and make it look like he was fishing he could give them 2 fines for each offense.  I was on the Rideau this spring and it was worse there. The river is lets say 1/4 mile wide but because of weeds the channel is maybe 300 feet wide. We are fishing a weed line and I mean we are withing 50 feet of it leaving 250 feet to the other weed line. Well crap not one but 3 cruisers flew right in front of us one after the other. I'm sure these idiots have no clue they were in less then 10 FOW. No wonder we didn't get a bite.  If someone did this on the road they would be charged with careless driving so why not on water?

101772,Beans,2007-08-07 21:11:00,3339,"Lew, Lew, Lew,...you just got to take up shore fishing for carp and leave the open waters to the idiots until the good fishing starts after Labor Day...  Somewhat on the same topic...Crappieperchhunter and I have been carp fishing Little Lake as our favorite ""swim"" at Carp Point hasn't rebounded from the carp die-off yet...  I was shooting the bull with a fellow carper and we were amazed how much of the shoreline was being eroded due to the wake of some boats...and who was the worst offender we saw...The damn tour boat !!!..."
