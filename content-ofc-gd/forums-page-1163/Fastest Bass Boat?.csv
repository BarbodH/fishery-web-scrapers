Once you know what you are doing or capable of doing,it,s not all that bad.  As for the helmet thing,I have seen only two boaters and non boaters wear them,,,,,,,,,,,Oh they were on a Bullet.Fastest thing I have ever seen.  I have also gotten to be a non boater with many of the top guys in the sport,and not once, did I feel I or we were in danger. Know you ride and know your limits.  Smaller lakes can be a challange,but when you are blasting out of big waters,theres lots of room."
104105,lookinforwalleye,2007-08-15 20:29:00,4399,I can see a helmet being a useful tool to protect your coconut from bouncing off the water at 90 plus MPH.LOL
104111,POLLIWOGG,2007-08-15 21:05:00,835,"We used to see the guys at Main Duck fishing tournaments out of Kingston or Belleville. They would have to get there and get their fish and get out before the wind picks up because L On. don't like bass boats.  A few years back a guy got lost and stopped for a look around, got swamped and rescued by a sailer.  They had a 30' pontoon boat up to 100mph, I suppose you could catch bass off it."
103878,Daplumma,2007-08-15 00:47:00,1961,My buddy has a Skeeter with a big ass motor on it.GPS at 71 if I remember right.Scared the quack out of me but he swears them bas are really fast and you need a fast boat.Helmet and life jacket are not optional. Joe
104070,jedimaster,2007-08-15 18:19:00,3472,"Even at 90mph down the lake in a tourney I have never seen anyone wearing a helmet, life jacket yes, helmet never seen one. I mean lets all be realistic its fine to say this and that, but everyone knows darn well when the horn blows and the throttles get punched everyone is at full throttle for some time weather there boat tops at 30 50 60 70 or 90. Mine is in the 40 ish range, but many more are in the 60 - 70 range."
