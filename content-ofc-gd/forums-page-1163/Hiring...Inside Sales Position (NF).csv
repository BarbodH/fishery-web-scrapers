103722,Mike Pike,2007-08-14 16:52:00,1332,I'd apply but it sounds like you'd want me to work.
103746,pigeonfisher,2007-08-14 17:52:00,696,"It is not ""easy"" work.  Roy, make sure to include on your resume that you are bi-lingual.  hahaha"
103747,Roy,2007-08-14 17:54:00,13728,And here I thought I could bypass the resumé part. Actually I'm just looking to relocate closer to my cute lil' Joey.
103754,pigeonfisher,2007-08-14 18:13:00,696,"Well DANG...maybe I could hire you both.  I am sure you would make a good ""team""."
103758,Garyv,2007-08-14 18:26:00,547,That's how I started out in sales.  It's a great way to get your feet wet and learn about a product thus becomming a stepping stone to outside sales or sales management.  Hope someone takes advantige of the job opening.
103786,Fishnfiend,2007-08-14 19:27:00,357,Would taking the job decrease the amount of time I have to surf OFC during the day?
103793,tonyb,2007-08-14 19:36:00,1637," The newspapers are the last place I would look for a job, good move.  Maybe it's just me but, I always felt that the jobs in the papers were the leftovers that every person has already passed up, or from companies that are less than ideal to work for...  You should have no trouble filling this position as it is a good starting point for people in sales by the sounds of the job ad. Tony"
103797,Headhunter,2007-08-14 19:41:00,5703,"Facts to know about job searching/advertising for employment opportunities; 70% of available jobs are filled by employee referrals 20% by online job boards and newspaper advertisement 10% by employment agencies Sorry for stealing the thread, thought some of you should know. Sounds like a great opportunity to learn some skills, get some much needed hands on work experience and a career path toward an individuals short, medium and long term plans. Good luck! HH"
103811,pigeonfisher,2007-08-14 20:07:00,696,"I agree with HH.  Our last recruit was from an industry contact and if I am not surprised by the results from this effort we will be hiring internally, bringing our driver from the back up into the office.  We have had good results in the past working with papers/internet campaigns that work simultaneously.  Let's see what happens here."
103984,motv8tr,2007-08-15 12:07:00,2587,"Well I'm not a sales person, but if the driver gets the job I might be interested   Depending on the pay of course  Maureen"
