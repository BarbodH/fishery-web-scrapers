Fished there last oct, got a bunch of perch and some bass, lost a muskie at the boat, it took a perch that was being reeled in but not any pickeral. Are there any? how about at the lock at Youngs Point? any pointers will be greatly appreciated.     Jim"

103888,Beans,2007-08-15 01:18:00,3339,There is a lodge close to Young's Point that caters to carp fishermen...  One of our members did a fishing show from there...  For a price they supply all the gear and bait...

You should be able to find some eyes in the lake as they are thru all the lakes in the system. Jigs usually produce the most action for me but some guys have great luck on body baits.  Good Luck"
104017,jimca11,2007-08-15 14:58:00,34,Thanks for the info. This forum is awesome
104032,davew3,2007-08-15 15:34:00,430,Try going up to Clear lake and fish on the left side about half way down.  There is a large weed bed there. Also by Hell's Gate where Clear joins Stoney Lake. Good luck.
