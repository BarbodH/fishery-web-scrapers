I didn't even know that I won until I checked the mail today and found a package addressed to me, I automatically thought it was for Shawn until I saw my name on the package.LOL   Thank you again K-Dawg for the awesome prize!   I will wear that shirt with pride!   And I would also like to thank OFC for having such a great community going (the best), and I would like to thank Shawn for telling me about this great site and showing me how fun fishing can be!"
