104036,bowshep,2007-08-15 15:39:00,378,FinS you should ask around on this board you might be able to get a nice used set for 350. But the Okuma package is ok. But my friend up graded his after a year of use (sorry he sold it 150 bucks). Peace Ken
104038,canadian_copper,2007-08-15 15:51:00,925,THE OKUMA REEL IS FINE BUT A HUGE NO ON THE ROD!!! ITS JUST A GIANT WET NOODLE!!! I HAVE USED MY FRIENDS AND ITS A WASTE OF MONEY!!!

104113,BrownTown,2007-08-15 21:17:00,103,You should come into Angling Sport here in london... We have lots of float rods and reels that will fit your price range and we will help you out with presentation etc... Ask for Andrew or Kazim.
104116,spanky,2007-08-15 21:22:00,195,"i just upgraded from my okuma aventa to a raven classic... only got 3 fish on the okuma, nice reel, kinda torn between which one i want to sell ($100 for the okuma or $225. for the raven- raven hasn't even had line on it)... i'm using a 13' quantum PT rod with it... the adventa rod was way too whippy, the okuma sheffield was nice tho... just got a REALLY good price on the quantum"
104142,FinS,2007-08-15 23:36:00,463,  Thanks i might just do that  and thanks to all who have helped me out
104251,Douger,2007-08-16 12:00:00,116,"the okuma reel is a good beginner float reel.  as for the rod, check out the 13' quantum PT. it's around $120.  i was in your position last year and asked around, as you are doing.  several people recommended the PT so i picked it up and am very happy with it.  the quantum coldwater was also recommended.  it goes for around $100.  you can find my thread on floatfishing.net called ""beginner float rods,"" if you are interested in what the guys there recommended."
