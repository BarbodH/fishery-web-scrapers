103751,gforce,2007-08-14 18:03:00,63,Just wondering...
103752,Garyv,2007-08-14 18:11:00,547,Gobies being an exotic species are a definite NO!  The unfortunate part is Bass love them.
103755,canadianguy33,2007-08-14 18:16:00,121,It looks like sunfish is a no as well.  Unless sunfish are part of the minnow family?
103765,misfish,2007-08-14 18:40:00,29133,I believe theres someone here that says crush gobies.LOL
103767,Joey,2007-08-14 18:47:00,9122,Only if ya don't get caught
103781,tonyb,2007-08-14 19:20:00,1637,Absolutely do not use either for bait.  You can however use Yellow Perch for bait in the Great Lakes I believe  Tony
103802,Artem,2007-08-14 19:50:00,11,I caught some Round Gobies in Lake Ontario on the weekend. Looks like the sots got here too. Hope they don't do any serious damage :S
103818,jedimaster,2007-08-14 20:42:00,3472,"Lots of gobbies in bay of quinte, don't use them, put them in a jar and burn them in a fire after you get to land."
103824,OhioFisherman,2007-08-14 21:06:00,6623,"Our laws in Ohio are confusing, yours probably can be also, here is an example of one of ours.  ""Fish caught by legal angling methods (such as bluegills caught by hook and line) may be used for bait."" I am pretty certain if I had a 8 inch walleye on a hook as bait there would be words exchanged, not that I would do so.  Here the regs say, http://www.dnr.state.oh.us/Home/wild_resou...29/Default.aspx"
103835,Greencoachdog,2007-08-14 22:31:00,8163,"Sure you can!... but if they catch you, they'll cut your pee-pee off."
103864,Guest gbfisher,2007-08-15 00:16:00,0,Georgian Bay is full of em. I have only caught one incidentally but I know some who catch them all the time.   I'm sure you could use then AFTER they are dead. Crushed heads and all. You can't use Sunfish.
104027,BGis,2007-08-15 15:26:00,15,Some nice soft plastic Gobies out now . The ones I have look alot like this . I found the gold works well in bright light and the Purple fleck works well in low light.  Hope this help and GL   
104170,fishindevil,2007-08-16 01:13:00,6254,I sure hope this is a joke right....  its people like you that spread this crap to all the other lakes
