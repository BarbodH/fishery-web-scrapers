This spot looked great and right away caught this guy.My son loves walking in the water and would go out as far as possible if I let him.Well, right after I caught that fish we go to walk up the river a little bit.I take his hand and start walking.The next thing I know he is screaming his head off.I turn just in time to see one of his favorite crocs floating down the rapids towards Brantford! There I am in the middle of the river telling him it is ok while trying to figure out how to carry 2 rods,tackle box,camera and 1 crying kid back to shore.Finally got back to the car,with him crying all the way and left.He was upset until we stopped and got him a new pair of crocs. I guess 1 fish in 5 minutes is pretty good just wish we were able to stay longer. Oh well, next time."
