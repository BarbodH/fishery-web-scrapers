The Sun was on its way down so lighting was perfect as opposed to many of the other times I've been there.  As the topic name suggests I'm hooked on taking panoramic photos now.  I just love the fact that you can show so much area with one photo.  Next thing I'll need to buy is a wide angle lens....but not just yet.  One thing i did buy however was a Circular Polarizer filter after reading a post by DanC a while back.  I did some research on the internet and not only do they take the  glare off the water, it makes the sky extra blue.  All the photos were taken using the new filter and I think you can really notice a difference......especially the pic of the mud puppy.  Also check out Mount Baker in the background of a couple of the photos.  It's located in Washington and its completely covered in snow.  Anyways I hope you enjoy this new batch of photos.....          "
103942,fatherof3,2007-08-15 03:37:00,1769,those pics are great.
103944,danc,2007-08-15 03:42:00,4677,Very nice Brandon. You might not ever take that polarizer off your camera ever again. I've got an ND filter coming in the mail any day now. That's my next experiment. Thanks for posting..
103950,brandon,2007-08-15 04:15:00,857,just noticed yellow in 2 of the pics........wonder what thats from?
103955,ecxstriper,2007-08-15 04:51:00,343,wow greats shots thank you
103958,jediangler,2007-08-15 05:38:00,1923,Great pics. I've taken a few shots through my polorized sunglasses and find that the amber coloured lenses work the best
103964,Rich Clemens,2007-08-15 10:15:00,3131,Very nice Brandon.
103965,motv8tr,2007-08-15 10:32:00,2587,"Very nice Brandon, I also like the pnoramic photos, thanks for sharing and keep 'em coming  Maureen"
103975,danbouck,2007-08-15 11:40:00,4380,Great pics! Keep 'em coming
103993,mcallister.grant,2007-08-15 13:05:00,327,Very nice pics Brandon! I have actually been there (Mount Baker). I was there in the winter though. It's completely covered in snow. I would love to go back and experience what you did. Very nice!
103994,dustink,2007-08-15 13:16:00,526,"Need a special lens to get the panoramic shots, or are you splicing pics together with photoshop?  Need to look at one of those filters!!  Great Pics!  dk"
103996,Deano,2007-08-15 13:25:00,767,"I've been using a polarizer also, but made the mistake of leaving it on while taking pics of our trek. It's to dark in the woods and the pics will be blurred, but love the pics when out in the open.  Here's a pic of Mount Baker from the B.C. ferry "
104002,brandon,2007-08-15 14:23:00,857,I just used mapquest to find out how far Baker really is and it said about 52miles....Now the photos were taken from a mountain and Baker still dwarfs anything around and its 52 miles away!! man I can`t even imagine how cool pics would be from on top of there.  And Dustin no special lens is required....or special camera for that matter......you jsut take a series of overlapping photos and use a program like photoshop or Arcsoft Panoramic Maker.
104035,Tacklebuster,2007-08-15 15:37:00,303,"those are great pics. Thanks for the info too, I was already trying to figure out how I could make panoramic pics as well."
