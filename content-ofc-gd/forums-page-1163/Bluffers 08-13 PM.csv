103736,vanillagorilla,2007-08-14 17:33:00,46,Vanilla Gorilla & Riley Salmon teamed up for a night of non-stop King action.  We went 17 for 20 with most of the fish being taken on meat 50 to 70 feet down over 150 to 200 FOW.  The average size fish was approximately 18 pounds with the heaviest being approximately 23 pounds.  Trolling speed at the ball were anywhere from 2.1 to 2.4 MPH with temperatures from 54 to 48.  The Start of a Great Night of Fishing    The Biggest King of the Night (I mean the fish)    This guy grabbed all the rods all night long    Mitch
