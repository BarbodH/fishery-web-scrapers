104421,Moosebunk,2007-08-16 19:42:00,3970,"nice ski  OMG VERTICAL HOLD!  OMG VERTICAL HOLD!!  OMG VERTICAL HOLD!!!  VERTICAL HOLD OMG OMG OMG OMG OMG!!!!!!!!!!  there it's said, now... nice fish once again.  Thanks Seaweed for posting the big Ottawa muskie"
104426,fatherof3,2007-08-16 19:45:00,1769,"wow,nice musky"
104443,Bob Devine,2007-08-16 20:30:00,251,"I think what some are trying to say is:Vertical holds like this one are NOT recommended. It is best to support the weight of the fish with both hands. It is a very nice fish, congrats. I am including a picture of a fat 42# musky and a proper hold so others can be better informed. Most anglers hold them vertically because of a lack of knowledge. Teaching others is what will help sustain a great resource for future generations. "
104449,derekadam,2007-08-16 20:50:00,22,"Nice fish seaweed!! Does the vertical hold mentioned above apply to all sizes of muskie, or only those over a certain length?  d"
104453,Guest Trophymuskie,2007-08-16 23:41:00,0," All of them but mostly on bigger ones as all that weight is held by the jaws and all the guts are pushed back toward the tail.  A proper horizontal hold will actually show off the fish better, much easier to see it's real size.  At least it's not a muskie guy abusing one of our big girls this time."
104457,canadianguy33,2007-08-16 23:49:00,121,Wow! What a beauty.  Thanks for sharing.
