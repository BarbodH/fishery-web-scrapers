Just thought it wouldn't be the same ( my boys kinda grew up there fishing trip wise and were good friends with Liz's daughter). Liz and Brian ran a great camp, and I really miss it, as well as that part of the river system. I was wondering if Brian is still running it, and how everything is going. Also, when I was last there ( 2004), there were positive signs that the slot limit was working with the walleye population. Anyone have any current report?"

The fishing was SUPER slow though, walleye seemed non existant, SM and Pike were far and few between.  note... we were up there during a pretty tough cold front"
