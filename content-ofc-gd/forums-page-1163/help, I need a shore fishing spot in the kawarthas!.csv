Since we won't fit in a canoe and kayak, I wanna find somewhere on shore we can just chill and fish all day.  If anyone can recommend me a nice spot in the Kawarthas, PM me. My friends arent really into fishing, so even if we catch just small bass or even perch, that would be cool.  Thanks for your help."
