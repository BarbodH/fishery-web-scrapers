Will be fishing for bass, walleye, pike or muskie and was wondering if anybody can tell me some tips as to what to use, or what depth of water to fish. Does anybody have a map by any chance? Please PM or reply within the post, thanks in advance."

I will tell you Kevin (Camp owner) will point you in the right direction, and there are a couple of OFC'rs up there now as well who will likely give you some suggestions.  Kevin is the goto guy for maps as well.  I might see you there, if all works out I'll be there for a few hours on Sunday  Maureen"
104328,thecraftyprince,2007-08-16 14:39:00,37,"Moe's right, Kevin will steer you in the right direction.  There will be alot of experience up there this weekend, look for the guy in the yellow OFC jacket that's covered in fish slime. I've heard he knows his way around the lake. lol And remember, a few beers will go along way."

104333,Roy,2007-08-16 14:58:00,13728,"Ya how IS your leg, Raf?"
104335,Raf,2007-08-16 15:10:00,3495,nothing cold beer wont heal.  2-4 more weeks in a brace and still possibility of surgery.
104464,Daplumma,2007-08-17 00:06:00,1961,What did I miss Raf?What happened to your leg?The yellow jacketed guy and Kevin will put you onto some fish. Joe
