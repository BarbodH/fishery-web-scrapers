103475,frozen-fire,2007-08-13 21:14:00,542,"Being a shore fisherman for most, if not all of my life, I decided to give boating a shot and fish an open lake. Decided upon Rice Lake as a starter lake since upon doing some research, it's pretty productive and not many hazards as well.  Yesterday (Aug. 12th), we got to the boat rental around 7:30 AM and couldn't ask for any better conditions. Nice warm sun, and a slight cool breeze.    Asked the owner of the place for some good spots to try out and he pointed us in the direction where there have been lots of success lately. We then ventured off to the desired spot and started to chuck some lures for a bit.    As time went by, it started to get busy....REALLY busy... probably close to a dozen boats all clumped together, fishing this particular spot. So, me and the GF decided to venture off and head for some other water where no one else was. We decided to try and hit some walleyes fishing deeper water out in the open. Out towards the middle of the lake, the water was a lot more choppy and we drifted quickly.... didn't feel like anchoring, so I just decide to let the wind/current carry us to wherever.  We jigged along the bottom for a few minutes and I land the first fish of the trip.    Back in the water she goes    Soon after, my gf lands a nice slab!    I then instantly get another hit, and I knew that we had hit a school of some pretty decent crappies!    We continue to land about half a dozen of these delicious fish but soon drift out of the school and we didnt' catch any more for the rest of the day. We kept these guys for dinner After this point, it was just drifting. We actually anchored one time, but found it was harder to fish just one area exclusively, so we just drifted around most of the day. We continue to catch a lot of bass. It kinda sucked and got me bummed out that most of the larger fish kept clearing the water and shaking the hook off though, but the consistent action kept me happy.          My gf actually hooked into something that was crazy... sliced through 8lb mono that we were using... muskie perhaps? I also lost a little walleye at boatside.  This is the big fish of the day, a couple ounces under 3 lbs. Lost one bigger than him though .     Then the weather turned for teh worse. It got dark, windy and wet. We were getting poured on and we decided to head home. By the time we got back to the dock, we were completely soaked.  Dinner from the crappie I brought home. Delicious.    All in all, it was a great time out on the water for the first time and will definitely be doing this again soon. This lake seems full of fish!"
103478,BFSC Kevin,2007-08-13 21:23:00,1351,great job there.. isn't it great when your gf likes fishing too? except the part when you start catching fish with your lures and she steals them from you...lol  mm.. crappie...
103481,MJL,2007-08-13 21:36:00,2427,Great report and pics dude!  You're a lucky guy to have a lady friend who also likes to fish.

103515,fishindevil,2007-08-13 23:14:00,6254,"Hey thats a great fisrt fishing trip!!!!!!!  ! nice results,and report as well....keep up the good work,and learn as much as you can,dont be afraid to ask for advice...and be open to new things,and ways to fish....keep up the hard work and keep those reports comming    cheers"
103516,tbayboy,2007-08-13 23:19:00,1497,"So when do you buy a boat .  It's hard to go back to shore fishing after a great day in the boat like yours (of course a lousy day on the water with a rental can remind you how a free day of shore fishing can be nice too but thats another story).  Congrats on the nice day, I'm gonna have to try Rice some time, looks like fun."
103522,BFSC Kevin,2007-08-13 23:28:00,1351,"even for that those that don't have the storage or the vehicle to tow a boat, a canoe, like a sportspal, hooked up with a motor is wicked nice too for those smaller lakes and channels/streams. i know there are a couple of guys on the board that has this kind of set up.. maybe they can give some advice if you are serious about looking into it.  dude, once you get in a boat, i don't think you want to go back to shore fishing! well, maybe for the toronto islands..stupid habour license lol  cheers kevin"
103531,Smokey,2007-08-14 00:03:00,1278,Great report Frozen-Fire. You caught more fish on your first outing to the lake then I had caught in the last couple years and I live just off the lake.  Congrats and thanks for all the great pics and report.  Mike

103596,frozen-fire,2007-08-14 03:12:00,542,thanks guys for all the comments.  any particular spots on the lake that produce walleye? i'm thinking mouth of the otonabee? how about muskies? or is it mostly all by chance? fish of a thousand casts?
103597,sharper,2007-08-14 03:16:00,279,"Nice report and nice catches! My girlfriend and I were fishing there back in May and didn't have any luck. Caught only sunfish, catfish and crappies. Did you rent the boat from anglers retreat? We should go fishing sometime together my gf and I and the same age group as you guys and we are from the gta as well."
103599,Hooked,2007-08-14 03:26:00,891,"What ever you are doing, you are doing it RIGHT!  Nice report, glad to see you and gf got into some fish, even the ones lost are always the best stories.  I have had many o muskie bite me off at that lake.  Good stuff."
103626,Whopper,2007-08-14 11:20:00,2174,"Good report! Rice is a fish factory doesn't surprise me that you had some success. I've had some of my best days on the water there.  sharper I was wondering the same thing, awful familiar looking areas.  Smokey don't make me come up and show ya how it's done"
