I phoned Fishing World in Hamilton and theirs sell anywhere from $45 up to $500 (too much for my limited budget) so the price of mine was just right (free)...  Fortunately, another friend had an extra bankstick that it fit and he was kind enough to give it to me...  Carp fishing can be a long wait between ""bites"" so the alarms can be a big help in avoiding a numb bum...  What do carp fishermen do when the 'Bite"" is not on...  Why they stand around shooting the bull of course...Or take pics...  "
