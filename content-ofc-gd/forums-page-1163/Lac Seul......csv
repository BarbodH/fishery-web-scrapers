I'm going to spend a week fishing this lake. Apparantly it is s'posed to be  very good for pics, pike and ski's. I'm going up towards the Ear's Fall section of the lake.  Has anyone ever fished these waters before???  Any info would be great.  Hopefully, I'll have lots to report when I get back.  Thanks,  Meely"

I don't know much about the muskie or smallie fishing there (other than the fact that both are there) but my brother was up there for the may 24 weekend and had non stop eyes to the point where they didn't bother with a boat rental one day and just hung out by a bridge.  They also had 3 encounters where a pike attacked the walleye while it was still on the line.  The lake is huge (1500 square km) so you'll have to pick your spots but unfortunately I don't have any first hand knowledge to share.  Hopefully someone else here does.  Even if they don't the lodge will likely be able to give you the tips you need.  I'm trying to convince my regular 'annual fishing trip' gang in Thunder Bay to do the extra drive to Lac Seul next year - looking forward to your report so I can give them some more reasons.

Its been 25 years since being there and l remeber it like it was yesterday. A guy l work with is from their and he says that there is a Huge Muskie thats been steeling line for the past 3 yrs. He says its the new world record about 5' long... ""he says"". Have a blast. Peace Ken"
