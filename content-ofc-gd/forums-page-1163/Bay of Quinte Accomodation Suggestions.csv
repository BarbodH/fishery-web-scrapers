104125,Andrew,2007-08-15 21:55:00,54,"Hello all,  Looks like I'll be taking a trip to the BOQ Labour Day long weekend.I guess this is fairly last minute but I'm looking for suggestions on places to stay.  Basically all we need are beds, and I guess a fridge would be a nice bonus, but no frills, just a place to sleep.  Probably Belleville area, but any suggestions would be more than welcome!  Thanks,  Andrew."
