I don't go to this spot after June as fishing dwindles usually, but went anyways. Had to hack through growth that was over my head(6ft.) to get to creek.    Got into some little trout on a Panther Martin, also caught a pile of big chubs. Some of the chubs might have been 12 - 14 in. which would have been good musky bait.  Little brookie    I guess there stocking Atlantic salmon in Duffins caught a few of these unfortunately.    Decided to head down river after awhile eventually running into these litlte browns.    Anyways, nice way to spend a few hours in the morning, not a soul around. The fishing was a little tough, the fish were tight to log jams and other obstructions with the recent heat and sun. Didn't bother the chubs it seemed. All fish were released obviously.  cheers,  ehg"

103986,ccmtcanada,2007-08-15 12:12:00,7971,Nice job out there...especially considering how tough fishing is this time of year.  I'm thinking of hitting a trib or two as well to see what's swimming around.  Great pics!
