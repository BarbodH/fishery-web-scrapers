104277,ccmtcanada,2007-08-16 13:07:00,7971,Sorry to hear this news!  I think everyone has lost someone close to them from this disease.  24 hours...wow...was it undiagnosed before then?  My dad fought and suffered for 3 years before he lost his battle.  Regards to the family...and to all that calls him friend.
104356,lunkerbasshunter,2007-08-16 16:32:00,2585,no ccmt it was diagnosed over a year ago.  he has declined rapidly in the last 2 weeks.  It was expected by the famly for sure it still doesnt make it any easier.  He is still hanging in there but in tremendous amounts of pain and the drugs are maxxed out.  At times like this you wish we could give a shot or pill to end it.  funny how we treat animals more humanly then people.
104369,solopaddler,2007-08-16 16:56:00,8605,Cancer is a terrible disease. My thoughts and prayers are with you.
