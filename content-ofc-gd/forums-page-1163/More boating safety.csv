104227,Big Cliff,2007-08-16 10:04:00,6899,"So you are smart and always have your PFD on or at least close by so you can put it on if you think you need it but how many of you have your whistle or flash light attached?  Because I often fish in the evening and alone, I always wear my PFD and I have my whistle attached but I think I'll attach my flash light too. Might even try to track down one of those small strobe lights.  This is a good story with a happy ending but it sure could have been different.   This was copied from the 680 news site.  Teens back on land after boat capsized Wednesday, August 15, 2007 - 04:05 PM By: 680News staff        Toronto - Two teens are back on land after their boat capsized on Lake Ontario last night near the island airport.   ""When you have two people that are learning how to sail and one falls overboard, which we know happened, it's quite possible the other person just lost control of the sail...it's quite windy out there and the boat capsized,"" a police sergeant told CTV News.   A nearby boater spotted one of the boys in the water and brought him back to shore.   But the second teen was in the water for about 40 minutes while rescuers tried to find him in the dark. They were successful because they heard the sound of his whistle.   He is now being treated for minor hypothermia."
104231,pikehunter,2007-08-16 10:54:00,1659,Good point Cliff. My whistle and flashlight are on board but under the cap inside my bailing bucket. Those 2 are lucky to be alive.
104232,lunkerbasshunter,2007-08-16 10:59:00,2585,that is a great idea!!!  im no safety expert but is anyone else surprised that he got hypothermia in august?  Great tip cliff thanks!  Cheers!
104240,BITEME,2007-08-16 11:41:00,1969,Very good point   Even the crackable chemical lights are great dont need batteries just tie it off on the life jacket somewhere Strobes are very effective and can be seen from a very great distance  Thanks for posting this  Peter
104283,tonyb,2007-08-16 13:15:00,1637,Hypothermia is a real threat in the summer on the Great Lakes.  Auto-inflateables are the way to go.  Anyone use an EPIRB or GPIRB?  Tony
104289,BITEME,2007-08-16 13:28:00,1969,EPIRB Emergency Position Indicating Radio Beacon There could be cost factors for some for one of these units but they are a great tool to have just remember to change your batteries evry 3 months religiously
104296,BITEME,2007-08-16 13:33:00,1969,  If you like to put faith in Autos that is a good thing im sure they are at least 99.99999% effective but for me personnely I put up with discomfort and good old fashioned closed cell flotation its just the mechanic in me that knows no matter how well its made sooner or later it fails and with such a device failure is not an option
104309,Cookslav,2007-08-16 13:48:00,1457,My vest has a light on it all the time...comes in handy tieing line at night as well. But the whistle is a great Idea!  I actualy have 3 whistles in my Safety kit...I spose I could spare one for my vest LOL!
104312,Guest Trophymuskie,2007-08-16 13:55:00,0,"""Life jackets"" come with whistle attached. But they are not made to be worn, well comfortably that is."
104313,fishnsled,2007-08-16 13:56:00,3520," Great point Peter.  Those crackable chemical lights are pretty inexpensive.  I've got whistles on my lifejackets and will be adding those lights as well.  A couple of dollars to possibly save someones life, good deal.  Great post Cliff!  Edit - My lifejackets have reflective patches which would help if a light was to hit you.  Having a light to start which my get you out of the water faster. imo."
104334,tonyb,2007-08-16 15:02:00,1637," This is precisely why myself and I'm sure many others, are guilty of not wearing a PFD 100% of the time on the water.  It sucks casting lures with a clumsy foam jacket on, period.  The auto-inflateables use hydrostatic inflators.  Meaning they only fire when submerged.  While I agree there is more risk in something breaking that has moving parts, it's less risky than not wearing a PFD at all.  They are coastguard approved, that has to say something about the reliability of the technology used in these new devices.  Tony"
104337,Zamboni,2007-08-16 15:11:00,235,Only have the cumbersome jackets myself....gotten lazy about not putting it on when moving. I'm going to at least get back to wearing it under power and when theres bit of 'chop'.
104341,BFSC Kevin,2007-08-16 15:30:00,1351,always good to have those two items on you but why were they learning to sail in the dark??
