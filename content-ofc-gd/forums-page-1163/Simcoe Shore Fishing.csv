104079,segment,2007-08-15 18:38:00,5,"Hello:  I was wondering if someone had any tips of shore fishing Lake Simcoe.  Currently I'm nearest to Kempenfelt bay, but I have made a few trips around the Cook's bay area too.  I don't have a boat because currently our new house is being built and won't be ready until Jan 2008, so I wouldn't have anywhere to store it currently.  Basically I'm just looking for perch/bass or anything to pass the time between the fly-in fishing trips or going on making a trek up to north of the North Bay areas.  Thanks a ton  s"

104086,segment,2007-08-15 18:54:00,5,Thank you very much for your reply.  What type of fish are usually caught there?  Just rockies/perch and the odd pike?
104097,misfish,2007-08-15 19:30:00,29133," Right now theres lots of perch and small bass. As I stated in SA thread,the action will pick up soon and jumbo perch and many 1-2 pound bass move in. I dont know what draws them in everytime of this year,but the shore fishing is just as good as the boat fishing."
