104219,issamhay,2007-08-16 05:31:00,77,did u really have to keep them all....
104220,Vanselena,2007-08-16 05:46:00,269,We released a bunch by not getting to the rods fast enough...lol
104258,Tacklebuster,2007-08-16 12:20:00,303,"Nice haul,  looks like it was a bit choppy out there.  Erie seems to be on fire this year.  Where did you launch from?"
104266,dustink,2007-08-16 12:30:00,526," I'm assuming that's a legal catch, so there shouldn't bet an issue with him ""keeping them all"".  Nice catch, and I'll be one heck of meal (or meals) to come.  Thanks for the pics! dk  -----------------------------  Edit - Damn spelling......"
104269,Vanselena,2007-08-16 12:44:00,269,Caught them out of Wheatley. There were two of us fishing
104270,Chrispy,2007-08-16 12:50:00,168,Way to go!!  We did good 2 weeks ago straight out of Wheatley harbour about 3.5 - 4 miles.....usually we run about 8 miles out but there was tons of baitfish straight out the harbour....it was great for steel out of Wheatley the last couple years!!!  Again congrats on your LEGAL catch!!!   Chrispy!
104278,tonyb,2007-08-16 13:09:00,1637,Nice catch and cool name too...Vanselena  Why would you ever release any precious gold from Erie?  Mr Walleye...meet Mr Frying Pan  Tony
104286,wuchikubo,2007-08-16 13:21:00,1114,"Nice haul, what time is dinner? LOL  Hmmm, the name and the face remind me of someone from Simcoe.....  Glad to see you did well.  Stan"
