It started off with 3 or 4 smaller brown trout, and then in a run about 4 feet deep my  float goes down and i set the hook into a 10 pound plus female steelhead. After quite the battle, which involved me chest deep in water removing the line from a tree while still fighting the fish he pulled drag 50 feet downstream into a beaver dam, and well you know what happens after that. After I stopped shaking long enough to tie a new lead on, I managed to hook into my PB brown, a hog a just shy of 30 inches!     Hopefully Ill be back tomorrow with a report of getting that big hen that broke me off today.  tightlines"
