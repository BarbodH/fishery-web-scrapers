124882,Raf,2007-10-19 13:39:00,3495,What documentation is required?  Can I cross with just a driver's license still?
124883,ccmtcanada,2007-10-19 13:40:00,7971,"I'd bring some proof of your citizenship.  I dont have a passport, so I give my drivers license (picture) and birth certificate."
124884,snag,2007-10-19 13:42:00,1932,"I believe so.  I went across last year with drivers license and health card (might be useless)  Make sure you have 2 peices of I.D. License and birth certificate  Bring some credit cards.  Basically, bring everything you've got if you don't have time to get a visa."
124885,Raf,2007-10-19 13:43:00,3495,"I'm in the process of getting my citizenship papers again (I am a citizen but my citizenship card got destroyed).  I have supporting docs but not the actual card.   No birth certificate.  Am I beat?  I sure hope not, this is a new job requirement."
124887,Jacques,2007-10-19 13:44:00,97,"If you're going in peak time you might want to try the Rainbow bridge instead of the Queenston-Lewiston... slightly less wait times and it's busy down there these days...  If you do have a passport, bring that... I think you get waved through a little faster..."
124888,thecraftyprince,2007-10-19 13:50:00,37,"If your driving over you need photo id (drivers license) & proof of citizenship/residence (not sure supporting doc's will cut it), try calling cutoms."
124896,jonl,2007-10-19 14:33:00,2,"Drivers license and birth cert. ok for now, but as of Jan '08, a passport will be req'd.  Link below to Homeland Security site.  http://www.dhs.gov/xtrvlsec/crossingborders/"
124899,Raf,2007-10-19 14:38:00,3495,thanks for the link jonl  this is what i found on the site   what i gather is that they still accept oral declaration (although some documentation would be nice) of citizenship at land & sea crossings.  hopefully if i bring supporting documents with me (but not the actual card) I can get across with those in addition to photo ID.
124901,JohnF,2007-10-19 14:42:00,3494," If the driving across the States is related to employment in the US, be careful what you offer as your reason for entering the States. They're protective of their own when it comes to employment, as it should be, and I know of several folks who were refused entry because they didn't have the proper work docs (visas etc).  JF"
124902,Fisherman,2007-10-19 14:47:00,7201,"Divers licence will suffice until summer at the earliest, NO passport required for Canadians yet. http://www.cbsa-asfc.gc.ca/agency/whti-ivh...restre-eng.html"
124908,Uncle Buck,2007-10-19 15:24:00,1000,i believe the passport is only required if you are flying over the border...  for now for driving across you need  photo ID and birth certificate  or  citizen ship card  or  passport
124912,Whopper,2007-10-19 15:54:00,2174,"Raf what Goran stated is correct, but from what I hear most of the time they are just asking for DL's from the canadians coming south. It's kind of up to who you get at the border. I told you about our experiences this year and coming home the last time we only had to show DL's and my truck registration.  Good Luck"
124915,Raf,2007-10-19 16:13:00,3495, Thanks John.  The company I work for has offices in the states that require my expertise.   I'm not sure I'll require a work visa but I'll speak to my HR dept.

124920,Whopper,2007-10-19 16:28:00,2174, Just tell them you came to spend money   lol Pete
124921,Cory,2007-10-19 16:30:00,170,"Your HR department should get you a H-1B or L1 visa for you to work in the US office.  Just wave your gun as your going through customs and tell them you are on your way home, they will wave you right through"
124927,blaque,2007-10-19 16:41:00,2419," wow, it only took 15 replies"
124929,TennesseeGuy,2007-10-19 16:46:00,957,"I think we should put your entry to a vote by your southern board members?  Raf, do you have any references?"
124932,Raf,2007-10-19 16:57:00,3495,Haha Connie.  None that I want to use!! LOL
124945,Badger Shark,2007-10-19 17:23:00,291,"We just came back from Carlisle and they wanted both drivers license and birth certificate.  My buddy doesnt have a drivers license so he gave his health card.  And they are really checking and asking a lot of questions.  Raf my mother was in the same boat as you, her citizenship papers were destroyed in hurrican Katrina in 05, she moved back here after losing everything and she just finally recieved hers about 6 months ago.  The government dragged its heals looking for proof, but allowed her to work and gladly took her taxes.  She couldnt even transfer her plates on her car.  Good luck."
