124783,Parisite,2007-10-19 00:33:00,66,"Good job fatherof3!  I drive by the dam almost daily and smile when I see that no one is there.  Just a sense of satisfaction that everyone is following the rules and knowing that it is a Sanctuary for a good reason.  It really bothered me to read that these guys were completely ignoring the signs that are posted there.  These guys definitely need a lesson on the regulations as Page 1 in the General Fishing Regulations states:  ""Do Aboriginal people need an Outdoors Card?  Members of Ontario Aboriginal communities, having established aboriginal and treaty rights, do not require an Outdoors Card or Ontario fishing licence tag to take fish for personal use within their traditional or treaty territory.  Personal use is defined as for food, social or ceremonial purposes.  Individuals should be prepared to provide identification when showing their community membership.  Members of Aboriginal communities fishing outside of their traditional or treaty areas must have a valid Ontario Outdoors Card and fishing licence tag.""  First, this is not ""traditional or treaty territory"".  Second, there are posted signs showing that the area is a Sanctuary between Oct. 1 and Nov. 30.  (I was carded when I was fishing there (Legally) the day the MNR Officer wrote the dates onto the sign.)  Third, Status Card or not there is no reason for anyone to act like such a jerk, especially not in front of children.  Good for you!  I hope this is followed up swiftly and severely.  Thank you!"

124015,tonyb,2007-10-16 15:49:00,1637,"The fact is, if he is not in his TREATY AREA he was fishing illegally.  The problem lies in the vague definitions of treaty areas for each native band.  I am a status indian and have played the game with the MNR one time to see what would happen...I was stopped at an access point on Lake Simcoe and was asked for my fishing license (which I always have anyway) and instead I handed him my status card.  He said, 'oh that's great but I know where your treaty area is and you aren't within that range, hope you have a fishing license' At which point I handed it over and all was well. I asked him how to find out where I could find a map of the treaty areas and he didn't seem to know of a public resource, but he was familiar with the particular band I am a member of and knew it's territory was Manitoulin Island.  This is the best online resource I could find, if anyone is interested. http://www.aboriginalcanada.gc.ca/acp/site...en/ao20200.html  As always, best to let the authorities deal with people that claim they have a right to be fishing somewhere that doesn't appear to be legal.

124033,Terry,2007-10-16 17:04:00,14456,that's a great link tonyb thanks
124072,fatherof3,2007-10-16 19:38:00,1769,good link Tonyb. Thank you for the support and comments.I tried to handle this the right way and can't wait to see if or what happens now.
124104,Jigger,2007-10-16 21:17:00,1237,You ceratainly handled that incident with a cool head. Hope tose guys get what they deserve. Good on you for doing the right thing.
124113,Tarzan's Jane,2007-10-16 21:44:00,1183,"Good for you.  For sure the guy could have been a lot more pleasant, but then again who knows how many have approached him on that...but hey...if he's in the wrong hopefully he'll know about it.  For some fishing is not a sport and likely wont ever be."
124143,fatherof3,2007-10-16 23:18:00,1769,"Just got off the phone with the MNR guy.He was really nice and asked for all the details.Then had me email my pics to him and told me they would be checking the area out more.He also told me that when he punched up the plate number a lot of interesting info came up but he could not tell me any more.Anyway,will keep the updates coming."
124162,bassjnkie,2007-10-17 00:20:00,1101," The Natives have no regs anywhere, the can shoot/fish anything and anytime. Friend is MNR officer."
124168,danc,2007-10-17 00:35:00,4677," Actually, no they can't. You'd better consult your friend again."

124176,irishfield,2007-10-17 00:49:00,26272,"I had no doubt Dan knew what he was talking about.... unfortunately we're missing a great poster on OFC because a few threads seems to go ""here"" every year around this time !"
