124736,brookieman,2007-10-18 21:57:00,68," Pam, i must completely disagree with you.  You should re-check your fact finding.  While i agree they will take advantage of any food left carelessly lying around....so will a dog...or any animal for that matter.  Regarding your comment on taking down humans...i'm still shaking my head.  How many predatory attacks are you aware of in the past 100 years....me, i don't know of too many.  Compared to the number of back country travellers, it's certainly not much.  Black bears rarely attack moose and the ones that are attacked are either sick or weak, or young.  YOU WILL NEVER SEE A BLACK BEAR GO AFTER A HEALTHY FULL GROWN MOOSE.  Bears are smart enough to know they'd likely not win that battle.  Futher, moose are consistenly in their environment so they know where they stand with them.  Not so in truly ""back country"" non park encounters with humans.   Chances are you'll see their asses as they run into the safety of the bush.  Have a conversation with any biologist and i'm pretty sure they'll concur."
124738,brookieman,2007-10-18 22:02:00,68,"oh, i hust wanted to ad something Pam.  Balck Bears are Omnivores, yet their is only 10% meat.  They'll take advantage of sick animals or ""easy prey"", but mostly they forage for berries, insects etc...They may be at the top of the food chain, but they'll almost never look for a fight.  They look at things in terms of energy consumption.  Foraging doesn't consume much, tussling does.  They'd rather just move on.  Are you talking from experience or just what you've read and believe as gospel?"
124762,Rizzo,2007-10-18 23:47:00,4754, its all my domain.  Last I checked humans are number 1
124775,danc,2007-10-19 00:13:00,4677,"Here's a few bear stories from the past in my neck of the woods. You guys can decide how they fit into this thread.  About 12 years ago, our local news station did a story about bears from a small mining camp approximately 100 miles north of Thunder Bay. Apparently one of the workers there had befriended a bear, and it was a frequent visitor to his cabin. Not just to the property of the cabin, but this huge bear would come right inside his cabin for dinner every night. It practically took up half of his tiny sitting area. He would feed it and scold it when it's manners were bad. The bear knew when it was being scolded and it cowered when doing so. And all of this was on video on our local news.  A few years ago a friend of mine had a boat seat chewed up by a bear during the night. Apparently he had gotten some fish slime on the seat and the bear couldn't resist. We had a good laugh over this as the seat was so torn up that it had to be replaced. We were camped about 50 yards away, coolers of food on the ground.  Once I was fishing a very small creek. The banks were impossible to walk, so we would bring a 10' square ended punt and drift down the creek. We'd stash a bicycle in the woods at the end of the drift and one of us would ride the bike back to pick up the vehicle when we were done. About half way down we could hear branches cracking and some commotion coming our way. We stopped talking and waited, as the noises grew louder. Suddenly a huge bear sticks his face through the bushes, not 3' from my face. We had a 20 second staring contest before I won and the bear wondered off.  Bears should be respected, but not feared in my opinion. I see them all the time. A mother with cubs should be given total respect, as should any wild animal with young. They are a treat to see. Enjoy it when you do see one. And my food stays on the ground."
124782,Rizzo,2007-10-19 00:28:00,4754,"After reading all these encounters people have had, I actually feel much more comfortable about a bear encounter.  Sounds like a lot of the time they are curious or looking for an EASY meal...and if they aren't, just yell and hoof 'em in his furry nuts"
124785,Muskieman,2007-10-19 00:40:00,2472,"I've never hung food in the trees nor have I made any special effort to prevent an encounter with a bear...as far as i go is to move my food away from camp .  While i lived in Revelstoke B.C '92-93...I became a statistic..  I was working for a Brushing company.. using a tool called a Whacker .. kinda like a golf club with a 10"" blade... anyway, I was in the Kootnay mountains and heard a SNORT behind me ... It was a 150-180lb Black Bear..20 feet away and coming closer. I had taken the ""Be Bear Aware"" program that lasts 3 days..just a week earlier I was fully aware of what i should do, no eye contact, be very loud and make yourself look as big as possible....and DO NOT RUN!!  Well!! that went right out the window I turned and SPEEDWALKED away and in a second the bear swatted my right butt cheek and i fell face first into some ferns and rolled over onto my back hoping to kick at the bear ,,, IT WORKED..it stopped it from coming over my legs ....  and now to answer two questions that were asked on previous posts....  My boss was up the hill 60 or so yards away and with him was his DOG a Doberman Pinscher.. and in my bosses hand was a... AIR HORN... that i credit to probably saving my life.. as soon as the dog barked and the horn went off the bear was off like a shot!  I got away with a trip to the hospital in Revelstoke  I was in there for a whole 35 minutes... I have 4 slashes on my butt ..now look like stretch marks and a puncture wound on my shin..  My concencus in this little encounter is that I was at the right place at the wrong time.. I assume that he did,nt see me and when he did  he was beyond the point of no return....fight or flight response ,, he chose fight.  After all of this I have gained more respect for the bears...but am not fearful.  I now own an airhorn  and it sleeps in the tent with me....  A cap gun is always worn by my wife when blueberry picking"
124797,danc,2007-10-19 01:47:00,4677,"That's quite a story Randy. One to tell to your grandchildren. As you said, respect is the key. I've got a few scars from when I was a kid similar to the ones that you've described. But they were made by a domestic dog. Not a bear. In fact, I've read many more newspaper articles in the past about people being mauled/killed by domestic dogs than bears. I wonder if people hang their steaks in a tree when they are bar-b-queuing in their back yards?  You can't be too safe out there."
124877,addy79,2007-10-19 13:29:00,573,thats a great point Dan!
124880,jedimaster,2007-10-19 13:34:00,3472,"I think we would all agree that leaving open food around your campsite is a no no. Part of the reason for hanging your food is not to keep the bears away its to keep them from eating your food. Thats why I keep the food hung away from my tent. Like I said I don't particularly want to come back to my campsite to find all my food eaten. If your comfortabe with carrying a barrel with you and jamming it under a picnic table than go ahead, but when I am in bear country I pack very light as we are portaging and I don't portage with barrels or coolers.  I choose to hang my food to prevent it from being eaten.  As for predatory bears they are there and they will attack and kill moose. Part of the reason people are asking for the return of the spring bear hunt is because black bears are preying on moose and the population has seen a steady decline since the spring bear hunts removal.  Here is a link to a study on Black bears. some quick points from the 5 year study incase you don't want to read it.  five year on-going study (1992-97) of large (120kg+) adult male black bears  there could be as many as 191 large males breeding within unhunted Algonquin Park  Predation by black bears on as many as five moose (Alces alces) (four calves, one yearling bull and possibly one cow) and one black bear has been documented during this study.  Predation by large adult male black bears on Algonquin Park moose (Alces alces) and other bears in excess of 40kg has been documented, proving that these bears are capable of preying on, and have developed a search image for, prey equal to or larger in size than many humans.  Back country bears that normally avoid human contact become quite tolerant of human presence at dump sites (food sources) that they frequent during the non-breeding period. The presence of food at back country campsites however, may trigger unpredictable responses toward humans by these same bears.  As a result of five human deaths inflicted by two large adult male black bears (Ursus americanus) in Algonquin Park, Ontario, a long-term study is being conducted to examine certain aspects of bears anatomy, physiology and behaviour which might lead toward a better understanding of such attacks. While it is extremely unusual to be attacked by a black bear, most such instances across North America ( 96.6%, n = 29) involve adult males in excess of 120kg body weight. Evidence at Algonquin Park kill sites indicated that the attacks were predatory in nature.  Perhaps the most prototypical quote form this survey is this last one. Funding constraints have led to a phasing out of the Algonquin Black Bear Study. Monitoring of the one remaining radio-collared bear will continue through 2001. In addition, efforts will be made to publish the results of this 10-year project."
124881,jedimaster,2007-10-19 13:34:00,3472,"Oops, here is the link http://www.algonquin-eco-watch.com/blackbear.htm"
124923,graftongal,2007-10-19 16:37:00,145,"   OK, so should a person keep eye contact, or avoid it?  I laughed when I ready your story Randy, but I am glad that you came away from it with only minor injuries. I think I would do the exact same thing, no matter what I have been taught!"
124928,Rizzo,2007-10-19 16:45:00,4754," hahaha too funny Dan.  We do that where I come from.  Tell the neighbour kids its a ""pinata"" and voila, got yourself a tenderized steak"
124947,pameladallaire,2007-10-19 17:24:00,470,"My husband complains that I don't fear bears enough.  Telling a hungry bear to shoo at your screen door isn't terrified of bears.  I am talking about my own experiences and reading the research on-line about the Algonquin bears.  Some of the links are still on-line.  Read at your own leisure.  Black Bear study.  Pam  Ooops, someone already posted the link."
124952,glen,2007-10-19 17:40:00,2641,Leave your food out in the open.  That way when the bears are done eating it and you they will be full for when i go camping.  Bears don't kill a lot of people but i would not want to be one of them.
124965,jedimaster,2007-10-19 18:37:00,3472," Dan, If my dog was a wild dog like a Timberwolf I would hang my steaks. but since as you say its domesticated than no I wouldn't hang it. But if I was a stranger at someones house that had pitbulls I certainly would think twice about walking around with steaks in my hand. I would think if people kept Black Bears as pets in there back yards there would be more bear maulings than there would dog maulings. And I doubt very much you would go prancing around your backyard with a steak in your hand while a bear is in there.  If all your basing your decsions on are statistics and not common sense then good luck to you. I studied statistics in greapth in school. The first thing they teach you about statistics is that its only a mathematical guess and common sense  and logic ALWAYS need to be applied to any statistical information.  More dog attacks than bear attacks, certainly does not mean its safer to walk around with a steak in your hand in front of a bear than a dog.  You are comparing a domesticated dog to a wild bear. I would not treat them both in the same manor."
124977,addy79,2007-10-19 19:30:00,573,"if were getting all technical here, i would re-examine your statement about pitbulls, they arent as bad as the ontario gov't has made em out to be, im sure this could be proven statistically as well...  haha sidetrack...  just eat the food before you go to bed n catch some more in the mornin!!"
124979,Rizzo,2007-10-19 19:55:00,4754, sweet and cuddly they are...rrrrriiiiiiigggggghhhhhhttttttt
124983,Sinker,2007-10-19 20:06:00,8692,Speaking of bears.....lol  http://www.jsonline.com/story/index.aspx?id=675609

124988,addy79,2007-10-19 20:14:00,573,raise em proper and you wont have these problems... the main downfall to this breed are all the punk kids in the city that raised em to fight THERE battles.
124989,addy79,2007-10-19 20:15:00,573,"too much of a tangent, im droppin the subject.  sorry for the hijack.  "
124991,jedimaster,2007-10-19 20:19:00,3472,"lol, ok I think we all need to just go fishing. I am very sorry for picking on Pitbulls. I hope no Pit Bulls read this and bite my balls off because of what I said."
124609,jedimaster,2007-10-18 13:13:00,3472," If you talking about me, and we are talking about living with bears then I have lived with bears in my yard, does it matter where I have lived with them? As for where I have camped Algonquin is only one of the many places I have camped. I mention Algonquin in my thread as that is where most people will encounter a bear when camping. I have only ever seen one bear while camping outside of Algonquin or Silent Lake. and yes they just happen to be provincial parks. I thought we were talking about camping with bears?  If you look at the original post you will see the person is from Southern Ontario and camping in the Back Country. I had assumed this was the Back Country as refered to in Algonquin. I have never called or heard of anyone calling some random bush up north the Back Country.  That is why I have been talking about Algonquin. If you want to talk about camping much further north outside of Provincial Parks and away from human population(garbage dumps) than yes I think you will find that you will almost never see a black bear. Most certainly not see one in your camp as they don't associate people with food. In those circumstances they associate people with bang I am dead.  Although I haven't seen any stats I would imagine that the vast majority of bear maulings and deaths have taken place in provincial parks or designated campgrounds.  I still can't see why someone would not recommend anyone to not bear proof there campsite when they are in an area with black bears....especially if they are in Algonquin or another Bear Country Park. Come to think of it, the last time I was in Silent Lake a Park Ranger was making rounds reminding people to bear proof there sites as there was bears in the area.  Also I wouldn't particularly call a random bush far away from civilization Bear Country neither. To me the term ""Bear Country"" is reserved for areas where you have a chance of seeing a Black Bear, not just some random bush wher eyou will camp for 25 years and never see a Bear. If you have never seen a bear in 25 years of camping have actually been camping bear country. I would think your not in Bear Country, your just out in the bush with squirels and racoons... jmho.  Make sure you follow the correct regulations when carrying a firearm of course. Also you better damn well understand that you are going to get charged with poaching black blears if you don't have the legal shot size and a tag. I always buy my bear tag incase I see one. I don't go bear hunting but I like to know that I can legally shoot it if I do run into one."
124629,pameladallaire,2007-10-18 14:11:00,470," Uhm, I dissagree.  I haven't camped in a Provincial Park since I was very young.  All my bear encounters (except the last 5 years in my backyard) have been in deep, dense, unpopulated bush where the bears have very few, if any, encounters with humans.  They are predators, and intelligent scavengers.  If they smell food, they will take advantage of the situation.  And when the bears have not seen people, they just think they are a new weird food source.   Why should they be scared if they are the top predator in their home range?  It is up to the people camping to be smarter than the bears.  As for the Algonquin bears.  It was my understanding that when a bear grows large enough to take down a full grown moose, they start taking down people as well.  I researched this a few years ago when the bears were huge up here.  People make a lot less fuss than a full grown moose.  Pam"
124633,Riparian,2007-10-18 14:17:00,269," Sorry guys, but my definition of back country includes random bush up north. Just because I live in southern ontario dosent mean I exclusivley camp in algonquin.  I guess I should have said ""crown land"" or ""northern Ontario"". I use the term ""park interior"" for areas not in the highway 60 corridor."
124637,jedimaster,2007-10-18 14:37:00,3472,"I dunno personal preference I guess. Just seems dumb to not bear proof if your in a spot where you know there will be bears. It doesn't take all that long to hang a rope from a tree. tie rock to the rope and toss it over, or even just loop it over not really that hard ot time consumming. Once its done once for that site you can just leave it there the whole time. No skin off my teeth if you get eaten by a bear in your sleep or you food gets eaten by a bear while your away from your camp.  But if your asking for advice I would srecommend 100 percent everytime when your in an area with bears that you should bear proof your site. But do as you see fit. It seems that most people bear proof there sites from reading this thread."
124638,irishfield,2007-10-18 14:40:00,26272,The point I made earlier was serious. It doesn't matter whether you leave your food on the table or 15 feet above it hung from a rope...the bear will come either way to your campsite. The only thing it changes is whether he eats your food on the table...or you in the tent because he can't get the stuff 15' up.
124639,Riparian,2007-10-18 14:48:00,269,"Thats how I feel, Irishfield."
124641,Riparian,2007-10-18 14:56:00,269," I was simply asking if there were other more experienced people who do not bother to hang food packs. i wasant asking if it is a good idea not to hang a food pack.  my knowledge is only limited by my youth, not my location."
124648,jedimaster,2007-10-18 15:24:00,3472,Have you ever heardof a bear going into a camp site and eating a human because it couldn't get to food that was hung? I haven't but I have heard of bears comming into camps and attacking humans where there was food laying around the camp site. I guess if you feel happy enough that you can safely bait a bear to your picnic table 15 feet from your tent so it will ignore you in your tent than so be it. I would still rather not have my food eaten and be forced to cut my trip short because I didn't hang the food. Of course you need to weigh the effort for yourself as to the likely hood of a bear being in your camp site. I mean if you haven't seen one in the are you camp in in 25 years then its a pretty good chance that leaving your food on the table isn't going to attract one.
124036,brookieman,2007-10-16 17:09:00,68," Jedi, i'm sure glad i don't run around the bush with you.  It's comments and attitudes like yours that put everyone in jeaprody....bears too.  To the guy that posted about always heading out with a loaded firearm.....to each their own...but if you have a gun with you, you're more likely to use it even WHEN IT'S NOT TRULY WARRANTED.  As was posted before, bears are naturally curious animals ( just like humans ).  Don't mistake their curiosity for aggression.  Unfortunately many do and bears are shot.  For all my time in the bush, i've never come across an aggressive bear....curious yes, but never aggressive.  Hundreds of thousands go out unarmed into the bush every year....how  many ""ATTACKS"" are you aware of....me, i don't know of too many.  Certainly not enough to give them a second thought while running around the backcountry.  Everyone's got their opinions on the subject...i just wonder how many of those opinions are educated?"
124042,Fishnfiend,2007-10-16 17:34:00,357,"So, bottom line, it doesn't hurt to suspend your food from a high tree branch.  It would really suck to have to cut one's trip short because ANY animal got into your food."
124233,Rizzo,2007-10-17 02:21:00,4754,"I've had a bear visit my site one night, and no sir, I didn't like it.  Although I don't own a gun, I sure wish I had one at that point.  Pretty sure you could hear my heart pounding across the lake the stinky beast was right outside the tent.  Man I wish I was a sound sleeper, would've missed all the excitement.  I think the best advice I've heard here involved hanging the food, but a LONG way from your camp"
124242,danc,2007-10-17 02:39:00,4677,"I live in Black Bear heaven and I haven't done a thing to discourage them while I'm camping. It've driven past as many as 6 or 8 bears within a few miles of where I'll be camping.  I look at a bear the same as I do when I see a Bald Eagle, or a Fox. No big deal. ""Look. there's a Fox/Bear/Eagle"". They live in the forest so we should expect to see them, if we're lucky. I've been face to face with a few Blacks. Apparently I scare them more than they scare me. They don't bother me at all. They're the last thing that I'm concerned about when I head out to the woods. If anything, I'm looking for a photo op when I see one."
124244,irishfield,2007-10-17 02:48:00,26272,I'm more afraid of a moose than a bear !
124262,pameladallaire,2007-10-17 03:32:00,470,"Everyone knows how I feel about bears, especially when there is no berries.  I love to see them, but I've met up with them too often, been tracked by them on a road walking and our prospector tents have been ransacked.  We always leave the tent door open so they don't make a second door out the back.  Bears don't want to be seen, they will visit your tent when you are away from it. They will eat each other when berries are few, and they will eat people too. Noise doesn't scare away a hungry bear, take the prospector that was attacked with a running chain saw in hand. Bears think Citronella is catnip, so use a deep based repellent in the bush. Always walk away from a bear slowly keeping eye contact and never run.  Man, they are fast. When you head to the outhouse at night, with a flashlight, and see two shiny eyes reflecting the light.  Walk slowly back to the tent and drink less coffee next time.  Pam"
123766,Dano,2007-10-16 00:01:00,719," Yea, same here. Lol, good story!"
123798,Moosebunk,2007-10-16 01:04:00,3970,"  I'm with Mike, although not spending months in the bush, I probably camp out more than most.  Never in the tent, although I do wash myself in calf's blood.    Lately I've been wizzing my beers around the site at likely entrance points,  just because it's fun."
123809,solopaddler,2007-10-16 01:34:00,8605, I do the same thing at night around my deck to keep the coons away.  Calf's blood? LOL!
