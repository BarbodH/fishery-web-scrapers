124519,Fisherman,2007-10-17 23:42:00,7201,"Went out to Barrie this morning in front of Centennial Park, perch were biting pretty aggressively, none of the little taptap-suck on the minnow bites.  Took home 14 decent sized ones, no jumbos, but at least no annoying minnow robbing dinks either.  For those interested, the Tiffin launch is open, but parking is a little tight, either park on the loop or in the parking lot about 100M west of the footbridge, lots of room there.  Weather and sore back permitting, I'll try again tomorrow. Met another OFNer, Pikeie at Lou's this morning, hat sure makes a difference."
124571,Photoz,2007-10-18 09:17:00,792,What time does Lou open shop during the week now? Weekends? Has he got emerald shiners yet?
124574,misfish,2007-10-18 09:33:00,29133,"Use shrimp Steve,it,s tastier. LOL  No idea on SBT. Not into used furniture at a bait store."
124588,tinbanger,2007-10-18 11:31:00,1028,"No shiners yet , just river minnows .Need some cooler weather.  Pikeie is working at Simcoe Bait Tackle as part of his co-op program at school  Stop by and say hi  TB"
124661,Fisherman,2007-10-18 16:45:00,7201,"Lou opens at 0700, 7 days a week. Went out again this morning, ended up going just a bit deeper to about 25-27FOW, spent a nice morning out there, caught fish.  Todays extra were a couple of pesky 4"" bass, no we didn't keep them."
124667,LeXXington,2007-10-18 17:07:00,1928,"ummmmm Perch, I can't wait too get out there again"
124763,Rizzo,2007-10-18 23:49:00,4754,I fished there last year in January in open water!  Here's hoping that happens again this year! We Barrie-ites are in favour of global warming
124871,misfish,2007-10-19 13:21:00,29133,"  Barrie what ites ?  Guess I,ll have to drag yer sorry butt out there come the hard water season."
