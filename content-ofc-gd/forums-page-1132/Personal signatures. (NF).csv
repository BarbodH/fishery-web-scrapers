123203,Roy,2007-10-14 13:43:00,13728,"I know that after a certain time we get to take things for granted and that's normal. But I've been looking at some of the signatures in some members' posts and some are way over the size limit. Board rules state: ""One image in a signature is allowed. Images in signatures must not be greater than 500 pixels wide and 75 pixels in height. Signature images must not be more than 100K in file size.""  The reason that this rule is in place is to save bandwidth of course but also, large signatures are a pain for dial-up users to load. They're also a pain to have to scroll through...examples like ""WTG nice catch"" then half a page of signature.  Please keep your signatures to the maximum size stated in the board rules OR LESS. If you want an example of what the maximum size for a signature is, take a look at the bottom of this post. And please note that 500 pixels wide and 75 pixels in height is NOT the same as 75 pixels wide by 500 in height. Also please note that oversized text is as bad as oversized images.  Thanks for looking after it.  And now, back to fishing."

123328,mistyjr1,2007-10-14 23:41:00,97,"                        Actually I do....  Why not just add something that would resize add the signatures, just like you do with the photo's just make them 500x75 click able thumbnails"
