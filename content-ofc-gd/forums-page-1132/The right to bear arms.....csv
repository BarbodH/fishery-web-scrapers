I couldn't figure out where the gun was concealed so I hugged her at every opportunity.  Never felt steel, but got a lot of hugs.  She and her husband are also hellacious Lake Erie sm fishermen."
125039,holdfast,2007-10-19 23:40:00,1813,"All I know is that I happened to find a gun collector /forum on the internet.  I'l tell ya this, there are real wierdos out there that legally own a gun but I wouldnt trust them with even a tooth pick.  As far as Im concerned, If Canada decides that it is a right to bear Arms for protection, Im afraid we'll be like the States ie You put up your Dukes for a man to man fight , Hell shoot ya and then Run,  Ah kind of sounds like TO.  Its unbelieveable how people get buck fever holding a gun.  I guess its probably the closest thing to being in a position of power that they'll ever get.  Just for some info, Just about everyone owns a gun up North"

125045,Roy,2007-10-20 00:00:00,13728,Yup. I think the Dawg's right on this one.
124925,JohnF,2007-10-19 16:38:00,3494," As far as I know the answer is no. I used to do some varmint hunting when I was in high school but didn't continue when I moved away from home so the guns stayed there. I'm pretty sure they were disposed of when my folks moved years ago. At least I haven't come across any of them since I bought the house from Mom and I doubt she took 'em with her. They were nothing special anyway. Just cheap .22's and the bb and pellet guns I used to play with. When I shot competition in high school the rifles were supplied for us. Our school had Lee Enfields reworked for .22's. Heavy suckers.  When I was in high school I worked two summers in a meat packing plant, often on the kill floor, and kinda lost my taste for killing critters. A few hundred pigs a day can do that. I gave up hunting and fishing then and only got back to fishing last year. Still not interested in killing warm blooded animals although I'm perfectly happy eating the meat so I have no objection to others hunting. I'm realist enough to accept that for me to eat properly something's gotta die cuz I'd never survive on seeds and veggies. Somehow the idea of personally field dressing a big animal just doesn't appeal to me. I did enough carcass handling when we killed cows and piggies way back when. Now I'm happy to have someone else do the wet work for me.  I'm not uncomfortable around guns, just don't have any use for them right now. I've been kicking around the idea of joining a gun club lately. I wouldn't mind target shooting again - probably handguns, possibly shotguns. My cousin offered me a good .22 target pistol that my uncle used to use in Police competitions. I think I'd still get a kick out of that stuff. The problem is that I'd probably have to drive to Kitchener or London to find a club. As far as I know there's nothing close by.  If the reason for your question is to point out that it's easy for me to be critical of gun practices I'd have to say you'd be correct. I am however not in favour of wholesale abolition of guns in the private sector. If there was only some way to assign them the same degree of importance and utility that we give our fishing rods.

124934,Guest gbfisher,2007-10-19 16:58:00,0,Canada Packers had the opposite effect on me. I didn't want to hunt before that time. After working there it made it easier for me to handle and I started hunting. I don't hunt anymore but am starting to get back into it slowly. I would want my kids to have the same opportunity. That may not happen the way things are going.
124940,pameladallaire,2007-10-19 17:12:00,470,"I sleep with my arms....my hands too!  LOL  Now, don't go giving my husband any ideas about a rod and reel holder for the bedside.  I don't relish the thought of a treble hook under the sheets.  Pam"
124956,JohnF,2007-10-19 17:50:00,3494," I honestly believe that the best way to keep guns available to law abiding owners is to cut back on the promotion of guns in our society as tools for self defence against guns. Pro-gun rhetoric pointing out the dangers from gun wielding criminals as justification for having more guns at hand is a double-edged sword that may well be lumping the law abiding gun owners in with the criminally minded in the eyes of the public as the heart of a problem. It promotes the idea that guns are in and of themselves that problem despite all the cutesy progun ""Bullets don't kill people, people kill people"". Kind of silly to spout that and then follow up with how they need guns for defence against armed villains. Easy to see why the solution that springs to some minds is to ban all guns.  Many of us know that a wholesale gun ban is not just unreasonable but totally impractical, accomplishing nothing in terms of preventing the criminal use of guns. But then many of us don't care enough to stand up in defence of gun owners because we don't have guns. That leaves the two interest groups to duke it out. The uninformed who think wholesale banning is the solution and the avid progunners who use the fear rhetoric to prove the need for guns. It's all negative, pro and con, and not an easy sell either way.  JF"

124978,aplumma,2007-10-19 19:33:00,6896,"A little back round of myself might help. I have owned guns for 33 of my 45 years of life. I have had guns that are designed to shoot with pin point accuracy and others that are designed to make a big hole quickly. Some of my guns include  light caliber, heavy caliber, black powder,handguns, shotguns and rifles. I own them because to be safe and humane it takes different guns to hunt different animals and conditions. To shoot a squirrel with a .22 is normal to shoot a squirrel with a .270 is insane. I don't pursue muskie with the same rod that I fish for bluegills with because it would damage the muskie and would be very difficult to do. Some of my guns are admittedly toys a Browning .270 with a trigger job and a 50 MM sniper scope is more than what is needed to hunt deer but around here I have places to shoot the rifle for the joy of accuracy at places that are easy to get to because their are enough people who enjoy this sport. Their is only one gun that I bought for protection and that is a 9MM Taurus the rest have their first job of hunting and some can double as home protection. Their is not many reasons that I can see were you need to carry a gun in public when you are not hunting but as government makes rulings it also affects us in the hunting arena too. If they make it illegal to carry a gun and ammo in the same vehicle it would make hunting outside of your property almost impossible. It is not a gun ban per say but its effects would be the same end result. When I was in the special forces their was alot of training that dealt with how to use your rifle correctly and how to care for it because at some point you might be asked to stand up for the beliefs that your country has deemed worth fighting for. I am not a gun nut who will fight till blood is drawn if someone does not see the importance of having a gun or decides that guns are not the answer. I am glad that they have a choice but the reason they have that choice is because I fought for their right to make that choice. For all of the people that have served in the Armed Forces whether it was peace time or war you took an oath to defend your country and rights by picking up a weapon and killing someone else if it is needed or to be killed by someone else. While not a pleasant thought it is the price we pay to be free with our voting and guns and the right to protest without getting overwhelmed by the government.  Lastly thanks for the insite John you have not attacked gun ownership you have expressed the same wish that all of the gun owners have and that is where guns are not used in a bad manner. I hope some day we all get our wish and in a world without humans it might be possible.  Art"
124987,JohnF,2007-10-19 20:14:00,3494," Art, I've had this kind of discussion often with a number of my American friends. The sensible ones reply in much the same fashion as you and I respect that. There are, on the other hand, within my circle of gun totin' friends a number of radical defenders of the gun faith who are determined to make it a ""If'n you ain't with us, yer agin us"" thing. Unfortunately, when I encounter bullheaded I become bullheaded and we have some dandy arguments in our newsgroup.  I have one word for you to add to your answer to make it perfect - ""you have expressed the same wish that all of the gun owners have -"" I'd like to put ""responsible"" just ahead of ""gun owners"".  JF"
125003,aplumma,2007-10-19 21:17:00,6896,I think that Responsible is a good word to add.  Thanks  Art
124675,JohnF,2007-10-18 17:31:00,3494," The two fellas I know closest to you would be in Louisville and Sevierville. The fella in Louisville is a hunter and pretty low key about his guns, although he does carry a handgun in his truck and has been something of an activist in the Second Amendment defence. The other guy doesn't hunt and has guns up the wazoo. He's the one who carries two at once. He makes it sound like Gatlinburg is crime central. Other than being something of a gun crazoid he's a great guy and would give you the shirt off his back - but not his gun.  JF"

124679,Terry,2007-10-18 17:43:00,14456,in canada it's the illegal guns that are a crime  problem  the government thought that the criminals would register all their illegal weapons  and 2 billion bucks was a small price to pay for it  too bad it hasn't prevented even one crime but that's another topic
