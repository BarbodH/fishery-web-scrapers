124842,lew,2007-10-19 11:46:00,12767," Doesn't really matter Deano, cause no matter which hand you use, somebody around here will tell you your doing it wrong"

124950,Cast-Away,2007-10-19 17:39:00,790,"Who is this Lew guy? Is he new to the board? Maybe we should have a ""Lew"" forum!"
125017,misfish,2007-10-19 22:00:00,29133,"My gawd Lew,you hit the nail right on the head. Now with that said,lets, LOCK IN THOSE LYRICKS."
124593,lew,2007-10-18 11:52:00,12767,"This question of changing the format of OFC is brought up more often than what hand should you crank a bait caster with.  OFC is now, and always has been, one of the most popular fishing sites anywhere, and there's a very good reason for that......we like it just the way it is.  As was just pointed out by aplumma, its normally very easy to tell what a thread is about just by reading the title, but if you go into it and decide it's something that your not interested in, it's just as easy to stop reading it and move onto the next thread.  Many times a thread will begin as fishing related, then gets side-tracked onto something totally unrelated, so would that thread then have to be delegated to another page ??  Nope, this board has been working VERY VERY well, for MANY years, just exactly the way it is right now, so why don't we just go on enjoying things  that work perfectly, and leave all the changes to the boards that are going downhill.  Just my dime though"
124601,Beans,2007-10-18 12:52:00,3339,My sentiments eggzactly Lew...Well said !!!
124645,fishindevil,2007-10-18 15:17:00,6254,"YOU SAID IT PERFECT LEW !!!!!!!! the board is great just the way it is.  ...people always think that the gress is greener ,on the other side of the fence !!!  ....and most of the time its not..  ..its good to see that the majority still likes things the way they are...cheers everyone"
124805,ecxstriper,2007-10-19 02:39:00,343,"Well for my 2 cents . I belong to another fishing board that is more locale to me and this board is much friendier, informative and well better."
