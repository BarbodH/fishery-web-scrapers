125320,tizfun,2007-10-21 02:45:00,292,"Hey all,  This is my first fishing post and I hope the pics and all work out..  Since neither of my fishing partners could or wanted to head out last Thursday, I gave my dad a shout to see if he wanted to come out and fish with me..  He's 73 and his first question was where are we going, and what time will we be back..  Told him not to worry, if he needed his afternoon nap, he could lye on the floor of the boat.. Geeezzzz !!!!!   Picked him up @ 5:45am and headed to Pigeon Lake in search of some walleyes and ski's..  Launched the boat @ 7:20am at the top end of Noggies Creek and slowly made our way down to Gannons Narrows.. Fog on the lake was really thick.. Don't think I had the boat up on plane as you couldn't see a damn thing...  Fished under the bridge in the narrows for about 2 hours or so and only caught a few small bass..   Pops is all ready for some Muskies and he say's let's start trolling.. There's no fish here..  Off we go and start trolling towards Pigeon Lake from the bridge..  He must have switched 4 different lures and neither one was a bait for large fish..   So here we are trolling and just as we reach the opening to Pigeon, he yells out ""fish on"".. I look and his $30.00 Shimano FX rod with 12 lbs mono and it's just a screamin..  I say to myself,  You've got to be joking..   After a 10-15 min fight, we boat this fish and he's all smiles..  It's been a least 10 years since he's been on Pigeon and a least that long since we've fished together..  I was so happy for him.. It made my day seeing his reactions to such a great fish..  Few pics are added of him fishing, holding his fish and the release...   Great trip, would do it again in a heart beat !!!!!!!!!!!!!  http://i184.photobucket.com/albums/x69/pro167/DSCF0533.jpg  http://i184.photobucket.com/albums/x69/pro167/DSCF0535.jpg  http://i184.photobucket.com/albums/x69/pro167/DSCF0536.jpg  And as some may remember the boat I bought last May from the USA..  Here's a pic of the rig..  Few changes...  Just love my boat  !!!!  http://i184.photobucket.com/albums/x69/pro167/DSCF0524.jpg     Thanks ,  Tizfun"

125325,irishfield,2007-10-21 03:02:00,26272,"The stuff memories are made of Tiz !!!  Oh and by the way, it's a federal offense to tie off to a navigation marker!"
125330,tizfun,2007-10-21 03:16:00,292,"Irishfield,   I forgot the rear anchor.... I usually don't do it, but this was early in the morning and not another boat anywhere near us..  If this had been any other time, I wouldn't have been tied up there..    You noticed it !!!   Sharp eye !!!!  Tiz"
125333,irishfield,2007-10-21 03:24:00,26272,Just playin with you...some may not know and if the cops come along you can be charged for tying to a marker.  Nice fish your father got. Still teaching you to this day and you can't beat that...
125340,fatherof3,2007-10-21 03:55:00,1769,"good report,nothing like father/son fishing"
125359,lew,2007-10-21 09:23:00,12767,"  That tells the whole story right there !!  Congrats to your dad on a nice fish, and be darned sure it's not another 10 years before you guys share a boat again  Great story !!"
125376,Guest Johnny Bass,2007-10-21 12:35:00,0,Great report and nice Musky. Your dad sure looks happy!!
125381,HIMTI,2007-10-21 13:19:00,33,Nice report Tiz.... How much does a boat like that cost in US?
125406,tizfun,2007-10-21 14:47:00,292,"HIMTI, The way you see it there cost me about $6500.00 CAN..  Original cost of the boat was $4500.00 and I've added a few things to it..  It came with a Johnson 50 hp.. Sold that motor for $2500.00 and bought the Yamaha 90 hp (same year) for $1900.00..  Kicker was another $400.00.. Looking at a few others now as I may sell this one in the spring and move to a larger boat..  I would look to the US for boats before anything here.. It pays to drive a little...  Tiz"
