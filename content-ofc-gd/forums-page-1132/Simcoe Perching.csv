As usual there was a larger group of boats all together out from Pefferlaw. We drove out and dropped lines when we found marks on the sonar way away from the crowd on our own. The bite was steady from 8:30am - 2:30pm. We caught well over 200 fish and found a large group of jumbo's. The best lures were the FinS minnow, Phenix mini tubes, Wahoo jigs with Berkley Power Bait minnows. Drop shotting on 4lb floro with a single hook with a 3/16oz Phenix weight was the ticket for the day.  I used a new Shimano Sojourn 5""6"" Ultralight rod for the trip and this rod was great for perching. Here are some pics from the day:  Lures for the day:   Good size Jumbo's   Great end to the day: "
