124659,snag,2007-10-18 16:38:00,1932,"Hi All,  I've been too busy and lazy to do reports.  A couple days ago after work I had an incredible experience. The pike action was stunning. I also caught a few smallies and LM bass I remember Mako showed me pics about a day he had where they hit a spot that produced nearly every cast. That's what I experienced. Literally, every other cast I had a fish on or a hit. Lost some nice ones too. Caught a very nice LM bass on my last cast of the day (you can see the darkened skies) and lost one similar. I pulled in a lot of snotties and didn't bother with pics.  When I went back the next day, the magic was gone along with the fish  I've tacked on a couple pics from previous outings that week and following day.  Conditions: 30-50 wind gusts 10-30 FOW 4:30pm-5:30pm  Lures: Spoons HJ14 Spinner (ala Clive-Mepps)  The conditions were perfect and they (all species) seemed to be aggressively feeding.   Here ya go...      The spots on this one were much smaller than most     This was actually the first one I caught when I got there   Nice end to the bonanza 4-4.5lb.    The next morning (notice wardrobe change)        Previous days winnings What's remarkable about these two is that they were caught while I was targeting Smallies! (report pending) I caught them on a crappy telescopic rod with 10lb. line, spincaster, no leader, using a Dollarama spinner.      More to say, no time to blab.  They are definately on. Go get 'em  Adios  S."

124691,Bly,2007-10-18 18:38:00,1556,"SNAG!!  So good to see a report from you!   Been missing your reports and humour!  Beauties!   (Insert little green with envy emoticon here)   ""I caught them on a crappy telescopic rod with 10lb. line, spincaster, no leader, using a Dollarama spinner.""  Reminds me of my original walleye gear.  Hope we are going to see a few more of your fall reports before the ice hits!!   Oh and one question...did you ever hear back from that salmon last year??"
124693,douG,2007-10-18 18:43:00,2693,"Very nice, Snag.  When you need someone to hold the net and camera for you, let me know."
124754,bassmaster4,2007-10-18 22:59:00,801,wtg nice gators and thats a nice bass
124755,highdrifter,2007-10-18 23:10:00,2534,You should have done much better..  I'm actually ashamed to know you personally...  aayyooooo HD
124759,Greencoachdog,2007-10-18 23:26:00,8163,  Excellent report and pics!!! Always great to read one of your reports Mr. Slackass  You have been depriving us and I loathe you!  eat a worm...
124760,Rizzo,2007-10-18 23:32:00,4754,"Snagglepuss! Those are some great fish, thanks for sharing the photos"
124770,fatherof3,2007-10-19 00:07:00,1769,"sounds like a great time,congrats on the hot day"
124779,PatrickGG,2007-10-19 00:20:00,562,"Good to see your doing ok Snag, weird how them pike congregate in one area for a day and next day they move on i guess there must have been alot of baitfish in the area."
124795,mattyk,2007-10-19 01:40:00,2110,thanks for sharing.
124801,007,2007-10-19 02:05:00,537,Good job Snagman!  You certainly know how to find those toothy critters.    Haven't managed to hook a single one at the Islands this fall - guess they are all in your spot!  But then I've been busy catching some monster bass instead  Looking forward to the next report.  007
124817,frozen-fire,2007-10-19 03:37:00,542,nice!
124892,snag,2007-10-19 14:03:00,1932," Just let me know when you and your wife can put me to shame.    Thanks man, I heard they have that nifty camera bag at MEC and might get one. Love to meet up with you and Patrick.   PMS - Pike Munching Something for sure!   Love your debates and would like to fish with you someday   No, (dude) typical man.   Anytime Doug!   I can't believe you didn't slam me for my ridiculous over estimate on the 38""   Thanks Glen, I was thinking of you as I thrust my arms forward to ensure a larger than life shot of those fish!   Indeed, hope to see you again.   Don't go, Toronto needs you!"
124913,ehg,2007-10-19 16:08:00,2666,"Nice pile of pike there! The fall looks like a good time for T.O pike as well.    Hopefully others aren't confused into thinking you caught them all in an hour, unless you changed your clothes 4 times in an hour.  Great report and fish, ehg"
124916,solopaddler,2007-10-19 16:13:00,8605,"Nice fish, congrat's."
124961,snag,2007-10-19 18:13:00,1932," Thanks EHG,  You've probably noticed how low the water levels are. I caught a nice one at OP and lost it because the average 4' drop to the water has turned into a 6' drop! I almost went for a swim.  Yeah, I want to make it clear that the first shots of the pike to the bass were within an hour everyone I wish I had been there earlier in the day!! (though, it could've been dead too)  Thus my quotes: ""When I went back the next day, the magic was gone along with the fish ""I've tacked on a couple pics from previous outings that week and following day. ""4:30pm-5:30pm ""Nice end to the bonanza 4-4.5lb. ""The next morning (notice wardrobe change) ""Previous days winnings  I will try to wear the same clothes every time I fish and post 100 pike caught in 1/2 hr. next time!"
125014,dsn,2007-10-19 21:50:00,1018,Hmm I wonder how I missed this post?   SNAG hits the jackpot again huh!!  There's some fat fish in there for sure.
125016,Jigger,2007-10-19 21:55:00,1237,"nice looking pike, man! WTG!"
