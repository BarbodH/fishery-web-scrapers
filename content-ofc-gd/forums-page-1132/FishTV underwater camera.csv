124992,JorgeCarlos,2007-10-19 20:21:00,109,I just got this underwater camera and like to know if anybody has any good or bad experience with it
124996,Fisherman,2007-10-19 20:47:00,7201,"Enie, menie, minie, moe, and for which camera could this be?"
125006,JorgeCarlos,2007-10-19 21:19:00,109,FishTv is name of the camera for $120 @ Lebaron's
125034,Fisherman,2007-10-19 23:15:00,7201,"Sorry, missed the obvious name when you posted it.  Don't have one of those, but I saw it at the store. The monitor part looks about the same as the other brand, controls are on the bottom instead.  Can't comment about the camera, but I would make an effort to get a 12 volt rechargeable battery pack, or you will be sending a lot of money to the Pink Bunny(Energizer battery).  I'm happy so far with my AquaVu. I built a 3/8 plywood box with foam lining to prevent it from banging around in the boat or ATV."
125036,Rizzo,2007-10-19 23:28:00,4754,wow 120 is a great price assuming it works.  I've got the aqua vu scout which is pretty much a cheap unit but I paid close to 300 a few years ago.  I love floating around with it on.  Only drawback is I spend more time watching the camera than fishing
