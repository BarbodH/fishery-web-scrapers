124652,Headhunter,2007-10-18 15:48:00,5703,"If I was fishin the Reach on Saturday, based on the wind predictions of a strong west wind, I wouldn't be launchin from the Glenora Ferry! The run from the cemment plant to the ferry would make three footers and make re-loading your boat an adventure for sure! HH"
124685,Badger Shark,2007-10-18 18:23:00,291,"Looks like it is going to be a rough one on Saturday.  They have increased the wind forecast.  Not sure if the reach will be fishable.  We will be going out still but if it is to rough we will be in more sheltered areas.  Should be an adventure, at least it isnt going to be freezing.  Be careful out there.  Don"
124694,Headhunter,2007-10-18 18:44:00,5703,"Not the forecast for Adolphus, but check out this link and perhaps consider a different launch or location!  http://www.crh.noaa.gov/product.php?site=d...i&version=1 HH"
124804,POLLIWOGG,2007-10-19 02:39:00,835,"Should be out there right now 19 deg. calm but real dark, I sorta like some moonlight to help miss the cans."
124821,Crazyhook,2007-10-19 04:05:00,1154,35 K Winds! Hold on Badger! good luck out there nail a pig
124914,Badger Shark,2007-10-19 16:10:00,291,"Wish we were going out today, its 22 degrees and not much wind.  Oh well at least we are going fishing and thats what I love to do."
124937,lew,2007-10-19 17:02:00,12767,"Best of luck out there tomorrow Badger, hope you nail a Quinte hog !!  Definetely one of my favorite fish'n spots anywhere !!"
124941,Badger Shark,2007-10-19 17:12:00,291,"Well now I am sitting here looking out the window and debating on weather I should build an ARK, man is it pouring and the wind has finally made an appearance.  How is it around Quinte ?"

125258,fishindevil,2007-10-20 22:37:00,6254,"Well my bud was talking to to his bud via-cell phone from down at quinte,and its not real pretty....very high winds,big waves farther down,the adoulphuos,reach...they havnt caught any fish,and its not getting any better and that was at 2:30pm this afternoon...i have been on all the updated weather sites,and all are saying the same its WINDY,BIG TIME....i am ready to go,and even sunday its still going to be 15-25k winds from the SSW switching to W  unless you have a big boat its gonna be a nasty ride for sure,there has been some fish caught by a few charter boats but they are far & few between,and there is no pattern about them,some fish have been caught at 40ft down,and some have been 10ft down...so they are scattered to say the least,and not much biat to see...so im prob staying home...grrrrrrrrrrrrrr"
125412,walleyedreamer,2007-10-21 15:23:00,101,"good to hear the big one's are slowly coming in be up for a week starting November 3 at Merland with my buddy Kim and two of my city co- worker. four city worker in two boats should be a fun week. lol. happy fishing, see you on the water, walleyedreamer."
125413,TroutSlayer,2007-10-21 15:30:00,64," That will maqke a great report WalleyeD, can't wait to see it"
125568,Badger Shark,2007-10-22 05:39:00,291,"Just got back and yes Saturday was rough but it was also sucessful.  We got 9 hook-ups and 7 in the boat, the biggest one of the day happened to be caught by me and it was 9.6lbs.  There were some very large schools, you just have to look for them, we were lucky to have a really good guide to put us on fish.  Thanks again Eye-Tracker.  Today we headed back out and it was almost a repeat of yesterday with the winds but not quite as gusty and they eventually died down, yesterday we had gusts over 70km per hour and sustained over 50.  We managed two over 10 this time with one being 12.2 and the other 11.3lbs  Cant wait till Sunday as I am going back every Sunday until I can no longer get out.  I LOVE THOSE HOGS !  The Bay of Pigs indeed.  As soon as I get the pics loaded I will post them.  Don"
123572,Badger Shark,2007-10-15 17:44:00,291,"Hey everyone, just wondering if any of you will be in Quinte this weekend?  I will be heading down on Friday night staying in Belleville, Saturday morning me and 2 of my buddies will be out with Eye-Tracker for the day.  I recommend him to anyone who wants to learn about eye fishing, you will learn more in one outing with him than you could learn in a year or more.  I have been out with him on two ocassions and always learn a tonne and catch fish.  I am sure you guys will know his boat if you see it, say hi if you like.  Sunday we will be out in my boat, I have an Alumacraft 16'7 with a 75 Merc optimax and if the weather is cold we will put up the homemade top, there will be three of us.  Hope to meet some of you there.  Don  Here are a couple of pics from last year   "
123861,Badger Shark,2007-10-16 04:28:00,291,"62 views and no replies.  Well if any of you show up there this weekend, it would be nice to meet some of you who are members.  I am asking because I see alot of reports on here from guys who frequent Quinte.  I look forward to this time of year, just something about catching those big girls."
123921,Terry,2007-10-16 12:37:00,14456,I hope to get down there soon but not this weekend good luck
123932,karoloko24,2007-10-16 12:59:00,11,I was fishing east of glenora ferry yesterday. I posted some pic on the board. I might be out saturday afternoon in a 17ft Tracker boat. If you see me say hello. Maybe I can teach your guide a thing or two    just kidding. Good luck and hope you get all the big ones as soon as I realese them.
124000,young_one,2007-10-16 15:07:00,620,"REALLY debating to go or not... I don't have the deep fishing stuff, so I would be targeting residential eye's. I got a tracker boat too. PIckering bay? or Napanee, or new location?"
124062,eye-tracker,2007-10-16 18:59:00,89, I am all ears...you can post any information you have.  -s

Really looking forward to my first trip there this weekend, and I will be going there as much as possible, I love the area and the chance at catching a trophy is a real possibility.  See you guys there and good luck to everyone.  Don"
124254,Dondorfish,2007-10-17 03:13:00,1000,Hey Badger Shark - we should be on the bay Saturday afternoon - moving the boat down there and hope to get out fishing for a bit. Look for a 22 foot islander ( blue) with a white camper top - stop by and say hi.    Don
124256,Badger Shark,2007-10-17 03:20:00,291,"Hey Tracker, thats a pretty distinct description of a boat should not be hard to see.  I will be out with Ey-Tracker in his boat on Saturday, not sure if I will head out in my boat when we come in but Sunday we will be out in mine.  Good luck hope to see ya there.  Don"
124293,tinbanger,2007-10-17 11:10:00,1028,"My oldest (Pikeie) and I will be out on sturady as we were succesful bidder last winter of the days charter ( part of Tylers event that Motv8tr puts on). Not sure what the boat looks like but we will be to busy catching fish to chat anyways  Looks like a wet day 60% chance showers , 35 k winds from the west  TB"
124333,eye-tracker,2007-10-17 12:43:00,89," Hey CrazyHook, Same colours as last year, plus a couple custom colours I had painted at the factory this summer.  -s"
124336,cranks bait,2007-10-17 12:52:00,721,"I'd like to head down to the massive ferry area to go fish, maybe on the 28th.  I'm just a bit nervous of my boat not being enough.  It's a Lowe 170 with a 50 Evinrude.  Basically a modified Jon boat.  Does anyone have experience with this size boat on that water?  I grew up on East lake in Picton, but never made it out to the reach to fish."
124349,eye-tracker,2007-10-17 13:26:00,89," Hello, You will have to use common sense out on the water and always have a safe route of navigation no mater what mother nature hits you with. Only you will know what your boat is capable of in the different conditions. If at any time you feel un-safe than keep the boat on shore.  Most days you will be fine, but fall fishing can be tough as front after front passes through with some very nasty winds. Long range for this Saturday is winds gusts greater that 50 km so it could be a very bumpy ride or impossible to fish out of some boats.  Fish safe...  -s"
124354,cranks bait,2007-10-17 13:35:00,721,"Thanks Sheldon,  I have been out in some rough stuff here, but I know the water here.  Also it's easy to get off the water here and call it a day.  I just don't want to trailer for 1.5 hrs to play in rough water.  Also where do I ramp in and out?  Is the best fishing just east of the Ferry?  Thanks"
124360,eye-tracker,2007-10-17 14:00:00,89,"Scott,  Fish can be anywhere at this time of the year. You can find small pods of walleye right now anywhere from Thompson Point and as far east as Kingston. You can launch at the Glenora Ferry on the north side if you come down HWY #33.  -s"
124460,karoloko24,2007-10-17 20:09:00,11,Hey Eye Tracker What you think about a litlle friendly competition between two Tracker boats this weekend. Are you fishing glenora ferry this weekend I wouldnt mind checking out how you rigged up your boat for the BOQ. Let me now and good luck this weekend.
124465,eye-tracker,2007-10-17 20:38:00,89,"Hello, No need for competition that is why I fish tournaments.   You may see me out near Glenora it all depends on where the fish have moved to by Saturday.  Here is a few pictures of the set-up on my boat.      "
124466,karoloko24,2007-10-17 20:43:00,11,Thanks for posting the pics of  your boat very nice set up. I better stop being a smartass and be nice to so maybe you can give me some pointers on improving my fishing skilss on the BOQ    How do you lkie your coffe sir? See you on the water
124509,addict,2007-10-17 23:14:00,475,havent fished quinte for eyes yet just bass hopefully ill get out this year good luck out there
124556,Badger Shark,2007-10-18 03:02:00,291,"Fishmaniac, I am sure we will see you at some point, just not sure where we will be, looks like a rough day on Saturday so take care everyone."
124624,POLLIWOGG,2007-10-18 13:51:00,835,Just want to make those fishing east of the ferry aware that there is a safe harbor at Prinyers cove if the wind picks up.
124650,fishindevil,2007-10-18 15:35:00,6254,"Thats good to tell people that plliwog,as that little bay has been used alot...as many smaller boats cant make it back sometimes and can make it safe in there....you dont have to be afraid just use common sense...the reach can blow up so fast ,and because of the lay of the land with the high shorelines on both sides the wind gets funnelled through there BIG TIME.... so always be aware and know the weather and the wind forecast for sure.....the bay is big water and we want everyone back safe & sound...good-luck down there this weekend guys but its supposed to be very nasty on saturday.....and be VERY WINDY...i might try for sunday if the wind doesnt stirr things up and make it to hard to recover....big time front going to come through,tommorow....cheers"
