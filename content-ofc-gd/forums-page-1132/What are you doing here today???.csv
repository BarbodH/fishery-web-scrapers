125231,Sinker,2007-10-20 21:26:00,8692,"  Don't wait until it gets too cold Misfish. Its starting to get good now. We shot all new birds today, so they're coming. Anytime now and we'll be in full migration.  Just shoot me a date and I'll see if I can work it in.  Sinker"
125254,fishnsled,2007-10-20 22:28:00,3520,By the sounds of those winds it was a good day to be at work.  Time to go home now.  Good to see that everyone seemed to enjoy the day.  I'll enjoy the overtime on the next pay cheque!

125293,Rich Clemens,2007-10-21 00:38:00,3131,"Well ... my neighbor and I went out to a local reservoir up in the mountains this morning.  Just had a front move through yesterday and overnight.  The reservoir allows electric motors only.   With winds, white caps, and only a trolling motor to use ... we gave up after a few hours.  Not hits, not bites, no nothin ..... just getting blown around.  Had a good time chatting and passing the time.  Gonna give it another go here before long."
125148,fishnsled,2007-10-20 14:00:00,3520,"Just curious, I'm at work or I'd be fishing.    Weather looks great here in the big smoke, warm and overcast the when I came in this morning.  So what's your excuse.     Now back too work for me."

Meeting Gerritt there at 1:30 this afternoon...with a bit of luck, we'll be boat owners and no longer shore locked.  Going to Rice Lake tomorrow with my cousin to chase down some muskies or smallies.  Sucks you are working Will....hopefully you get out tomorrow as planned.  If I buy this boat today, then I'll cancel the appointment for tomorrow....so you can fish longer....LOL."
125157,keram,2007-10-20 14:14:00,585,"There is other thing I like to do at this time of year (apart from fishing). It is almost like fishing but muuuuuuch cheaper  . Yesterday I was in the woods and picked up couple of decent size baskets of the wild mushrooms ( before you start: they are not magic   ), so today I'm making them ready for consumption (drying and pickling) and trying new recipes.  Delicious"

125160,ccmtcanada,2007-10-20 14:38:00,7971," Thanks cranks!  Hopefully it pans out for us...we are pretty excited.  One way or another though, we will be on the water by spring."
