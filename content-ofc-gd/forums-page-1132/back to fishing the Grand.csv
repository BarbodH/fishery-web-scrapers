Was kind of worried about what to expect with the rain but the water was pretty clear and not a lot of weeds floating down yet.After a little while I felt a soft hit and ended up catching this guy.   He decided to splash around and ended up soaking me while I tried to pick him up.Thanks for taking the pics Kennyman,lot easier than trying to take them myself.After seeing that Kennyman decided to get right into it.  He had no luck for his efforts though.Stayed for a little while longer with no hits so went home."

124982,Marko,2007-10-19 20:05:00,854,how do you guys post pictures like that so it looks like a story?? You have a pic and you can write something underneath and so on. I know a way where you attach files and you can only upload 250k worth of files. on most of my reports i had to choose 2 or 3 nice pictures and post them and leave the rest behind lol.  any help would be appriciated thank you
125022,fatherof3,2007-10-19 22:11:00,1769,"thanks guy, Xrap the funny thing is that I didn't even think it was that big at the time until I saw the pics later."
125054,kennyman,2007-10-20 00:45:00,737,"Yep, didn't catch a darn thing, but saw the pied piper in action. He whistled them in again."
125055,fatherof3,2007-10-20 00:48:00,1769,"lol,think you are right Kennyman,will have to whistle more"
125057,Rizzo,2007-10-20 01:00:00,4754,"ooooo son, that's a big'un.  I guess even carp tie on the feedbag!"
125095,tbayboy,2007-10-20 03:29:00,1497,Nice size carp and great pictures as always.  Good to see your still hitting them.
125109,Mike Pike,2007-10-20 06:05:00,1332,"Did you get all that crazy wind and weather down your way fatherof3???  I fished a Grand trib in the Kitchener area Friday afternoon and the SW winds were pretty wicked.  Plus the skies were really changable.  At one time, they got so dark it looked like I was gonna get hit with some pretty severe weather.   Found the fish were pretty inactive too (althought you got yourself a biggun there).  I was casting spinners and Rapalas as usual but found that the Smallies were not in a chasing mood, so I switched to a tube jig, rigged it weedless, and dragged it nice and slow along the bottom.  Only caught a couple of foot long bass but I think switching up made the difference.  Here's one of 'em. "
125123,fatherof3,2007-10-20 11:41:00,1769,"hey Mike Pike,ya the winds picked up pretty good in the afternoon and it rained hard for maybe 10 minutes then the sun came out.Nice bass by the way"
125305,kennyman,2007-10-21 00:59:00,737,"Looks like I'm praying in the pic of me (in the water) ...... oh yeah, I think I was LOL . Can't even see my pole?"
125335,blizzcat,2007-10-21 03:26:00,92,holy smokes. i think that fish could eat me for dinner!
125379,Guest Johnny Bass,2007-10-21 13:04:00,0,"Ive always fished the grand, south of Caledonia, but there seems to be alot of great reports from the grand and some really great looking scenery and great looking water. Thanks for sharing!"
