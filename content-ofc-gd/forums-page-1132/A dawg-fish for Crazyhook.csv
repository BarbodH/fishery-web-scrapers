125365,mattyk,2007-10-21 11:54:00,2110,"They love those bulldawgs down here in Kentucky Lew, especially during cold fronts."
125369,lew,2007-10-21 12:14:00,12767,"Matt, Jamie & I have been having an ongoing discussion for the last 4 years about which is the better musky bait, Suicks or Dawgs.  Jamie became a Suick believer this year, and that was my 1st fish on the Dawg he gave me, although it was  sposed to be a musky rather than a pike, but sometime ya can't help what grabs yer hook  As for cold fronts, we had one go thru here on Friday night, but it  didn't slow the fishing down too much yesterday, as Squid & I saw, caught, missed, 6 or 8 muskies & pike. Just had to slow our presentations down and things worked well."
125370,fishindevil,2007-10-21 12:14:00,6254,Nice pike Lew !!!!!! i see you caught him this morning...cheers
125371,lew,2007-10-21 12:18:00,12767," Nope, we were just fishing some sheltered waters yesterday Shawn, there was too much wind on the big lakes."
125372,Guest Johnny Bass,2007-10-21 12:23:00,0,Nice Pike. Those bull dawgs have some great action and look great in the water. The problem is that they dont look like they will last too long!
125377,lew,2007-10-21 12:42:00,12767,"Your right about the durability of those baits JohhnyB, that was only a small pike but he nearly tore the tail off the Dawg. A big fish would make a real mess outta them, but I spose it would be worth it"
125382,Greencoachdog,2007-10-21 13:19:00,8163,That's a great pic and a nice Pike Lew!  How do you fish those lures? Cast and retrieve?
125388,lew,2007-10-21 13:49:00,12767,"Yup, pretty well a straight retrieve Glen.  Not alot of action to them and it's sorta like casting a brick, and that particular bait is about 18"" long and heavy, with a long thin tail that flutters like a ribbon cutting thru the water.  Jamie gets alot of BIG fish with them, but I'm still trying to get used to fishing them as their a totally different concept to what I'm used to."
125393,irishfield,2007-10-21 14:12:00,26272,Nice pike Lew! Maybe you need to carry a bottle of this in the boat...  http://www.prosoftbaitglue.com/store/index.htm
125397,Roy,2007-10-21 14:19:00,13728,"Good thread, Lew. I guess that's why Jamie's selling off some baits in the classifieds. He needs room for all the Suicks he's buying."
125444,Squid,2007-10-21 19:14:00,1656,That sure  was a great day on the water Lew!!
125454,Handlebarz,2007-10-21 21:04:00,3790,Glad you guys had a fun time out there as for them dawgs I have the swamp donkee version and have yet to get anything but I have not given them a  true try I hope to jig them this fall
125477,Rizzo,2007-10-21 23:42:00,4754,"I like 'em both, suicks and bulldawgs.  Those magnum dawgs are a brute to cast though, I like em drifting over deep rocky water.  Once you get them out there, the retrieve is a piece of cake"
125481,Sinker,2007-10-21 23:48:00,8692,I've had no luck on the dawgs yet either......they look good though......just not to the fish I guess.  Sinker
125520,mattyk,2007-10-22 01:20:00,2110,"They just had the PMTT (Professional Musky Tournament Trail) Championships down here in Kentucky this weekend and 1st, 3rd, 4th place teams were all using bulldawgs."
125548,Crazyhook,2007-10-22 03:32:00,1154,"  trying to get more dawgs!!1  after the last fish I already bought a few suicks \ Lew keep throwing that bait, it is the time! you have to remember the monster I caught on that bait with you  :)  :)"
