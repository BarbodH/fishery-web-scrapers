124995,Marko,2007-10-19 20:47:00,854,"Hey guys i havent posted anything smart with pics in a while so here is a little something. 2 weeks ago decided to hit the nearby lake for some baby carp. I knew it was shallow but i didnt realize it was this shallow.    Water is usually all the way up to the trees on the other side of the lake. Made some bait, something i picked up from an old fisherman. Guy kept on bragging about it so i had to try it out  in couple of hours ended up going 6/8, fiesty little buggers:    They just kept on hitting one after another one after another one   ended up going 6/8 They were not huge but a lot of fun to catch. This is my first time posting pictures using photobucket so i am sorry if i mess up on something.  Spacial thanks to Sinker who showed me how to do it Thanks man!"

125197,dsn,2007-10-20 18:24:00,1018,Ok now I never caught a carp with red lipstick like your last pic but I will try to catch one like that soon.
125206,Marko,2007-10-20 18:43:00,854,lol Victor what is all this talk about you catching baby carp lol I think i remember seeing a picture of you with a carp that fit into your hand lol. lol red lips are either from my hook or the bait he got himself into and they are  rare like that so good luck
125210,MJL,2007-10-20 19:17:00,2427,Great catch.  Carp at any size can pull like submarines.
125262,Bly,2007-10-20 22:47:00,1556,"WTG and they don't look like babies to me!   I have noticed many carp moving back in, was wondering if anyone was catching.  I do like they way they fight."
125271,boddah,2007-10-20 23:08:00,61,is that clairville dam you are fishing??
125284,Marko,2007-10-21 00:13:00,854,"I am thinking of heading back there tomorrow to see if there are still any fish swimming around. It was in Elmira, fairly close to Kitchener There is a dam nearby but i doubt its called the clairville dam."
