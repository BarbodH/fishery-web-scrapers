125535,Greencoachdog,2007-10-22 01:59:00,8163,Y'all stay out in the Deer woods... more room out on the lake for me!!!!
125575,Big Cliff,2007-10-22 09:42:00,6899,"I was out again last night and saw one but couldn't get a clean shot at it. That is the 4th one I have seen in 5 trips but they are really skittish. They seem to be hanging back in the cedars still, just hasn't been cold enough to get them moving around much."
