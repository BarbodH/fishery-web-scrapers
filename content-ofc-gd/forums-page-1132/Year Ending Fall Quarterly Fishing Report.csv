124823,danw,2007-10-19 05:20:00,72,"This report combines my last few outings into one report.  From the end of summer till now...here are some of my non-skunked fishing trips.  Fishing Trip 1:  I got a chance to go fishing on the canoe with my dad. Overall the day was slow. A few perches and rockbass. The scenery was nice, the trees were just starting to chance colour.  It was better than than getting skunked, here's proof.    Fishing Trip 2:  This was on the Sept 30, it was the last day for the season so me and my buddy decided to give it one more try. We were casting cleos. I lost a few, but it was worth it.  On my first cast, I get this....  Maybe it was really hungry. It hanged on long enough for the shot.  After about 100++ cast. I landed this salmon after a good 10min fight. The adrenaline from your reel going ZzzzInnNnNGGGGG... was awesome.  Not sure how big it was, but it was my PB! Can you see the smile on my face?   Fishing Trip 3:  Took the canoe out again with my dad. The trees started to have more colour and the scenery was much nicer. The dad started slow again.  I took a few photo's to show that I didn't get skunked.    Now the best for last...  I set up my light weight rod with a minnow and float, tossed it and started to fix my line tangle in my other rod. I wasn't paying much attention to my float. When I checked on it, fish on!! Thinking it was another rockbass I reel it in. Not much resistant, then all of a sudden ZzzINgggg... I start reeling it in, telling my dad to grab the net. I had no idea what it was. My dad netted it quickly when it was besides the canoe. The hook fell off right away, a size #4 hook. Luckily it fell in the net. When my dad lifts it up... Holy $H**. To my surprise. 6.7 lb 21inch Largemouth. My slow day ended off great. I felt really lucky.   Me smiling.        My personal best LM.   My dad holding it, the colours show better.  I blurred the imaged because I am camera shy, and I look forward of going back next year when the fishies are bigger.  I have been double digit skunked, and canoe in a thunderstorm, but had an awesome fishing season. I think caught more fish this year, than all my years fishing. Thanks to this board with great reports and sparking interest in fishing again.  "
124824,lew,2007-10-19 08:36:00,12767,"I spose it's a decent bass, but who can tell with the way the pics are destroyed.  Never could figure why folks even bother posting pictures if their gonna ruin them 1st.  Congrats on the PB..........I guess"
124828,misfish,2007-10-19 10:39:00,29133,Lew.  Shame though.nice fish.

124832,Marko,2007-10-19 11:01:00,854,"I was wondering the same thing. Never quite could understand why people blur the backgrounds when posting a pic. Personally i never would ""steal"" spots by looking at pics here, part of fishing is actually finding the fish. COngrats on  nice fish tho"
124838,Deano,2007-10-19 11:29:00,767,Witness Protection Program or America's Most Wanted. LOL  Interesting report though.
124840,crappieperchhunter,2007-10-19 11:38:00,2582,"Whenever I click on a thread with butchered pictures....two thoughts always come to mind. One, why did you bother posting a picture at all...and two...I wish I hadn't wasted my time."
124860,misfish,2007-10-19 12:52:00,29133,  
124862,tonyb,2007-10-19 12:57:00,1637,"Yeah I agree, I don't think the intent was to blur backgrounds but probably just wanted to hide himself.  Either way, I guess what you are looking for is... 'Nice fish man!'  Tony"
124866,Jacques,2007-10-19 13:06:00,97,That's a beautiful Bass!  Congratulations!
124867,Terry,2007-10-19 13:07:00,14456,"if you are wondering I decided to distort my post except for the fish, which you can see in my post( well the word fish) so I did the same as danw showed fish but distorted everything else....I thought it was being funny  oh well I amuse myself........"
124878,snag,2007-10-19 13:32:00,1932,"Come on guys,  He's camera shy. cut some slack  Crop your head from the shots and repost.  I do disagree with blurring the backgrounds though. Looks like a remote location that nobody will find.  AWESOME BASS!!!"
124894,cityfisher,2007-10-19 14:14:00,959,great fish but honestly no point in posting those...  If your scared about posting your face or the background might as well keep it to your self... Just my 2 cents
124904,bucktail,2007-10-19 15:23:00,1857,Jimmy Hofa is still fishing in Ontario!
124909,ccmtcanada,2007-10-19 15:29:00,7971,Nice work!  I dont mind the photoshopping myself...you can still see how big the fish is in relation to it's surroundings the way you've done it.  Congrats on a successful quarter!
124926,TennesseeGuy,2007-10-19 16:38:00,957,"I believe we have a new, young, member who is attempting to contribute to the board.  Hopefully he'll accept our well intended advice and stick around.   He's a young man headed in the right direction by spending time on the water with his father.  How's this???  ....and this? "
124931,cranks bait,2007-10-19 16:51:00,721,"Nice catch on the fish!!!  Tennesseeguy, what is that graph?  I have it on my unit, but have no idea what it is for or how to use it.  The top picture that is, I know how the depth finder works.  Mine always tells me where the fish aren't at;)"
124935,TennesseeGuy,2007-10-19 16:59:00,957,Will PM in a couple of minutes.
124936,Terry,2007-10-19 17:01:00,14456,the X15 great unit the graph shows the satellites it's receiving and how strong the signal
124938,misfish,2007-10-19 17:03:00,29133,  Im waiting for a deer friend to sell me his     Nice unit.
124939,cranks bait,2007-10-19 17:09:00,721,"That's it?  What satelites I am recieving.  I'm guessing that is the circle graph, because the rest is really easy as to location, alt, etc. I got the unit used from my brother in law and thought it might have been his hotspots orsomething.  Now I guess it's even more useless information than I thought."
124943,Terry,2007-10-19 17:19:00,14456,yeah the circle shows you where they are in the sky
124948,Roy,2007-10-19 17:28:00,13728,"Dan has just asked me to delete this thread. Being the originator of this thread, he is allowed to have his own threads deleted however, in this case, I'll just lock it. Everyone is entitled to their opinion but I really don't feel that jumping all over a relative newbie for the way he presented his report is the way to go. If the thread disappears, it'll be because he has asked me again and in that case, we will have lost a good intentioned young angler.  It's the way I feel."
