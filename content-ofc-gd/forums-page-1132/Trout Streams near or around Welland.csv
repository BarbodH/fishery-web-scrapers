124503,ranger79com,2007-10-17 23:08:00,7,This is my first fall in the area and would like to have some help finding the trout streams anywhere local to Welland. Hopefully someone can help. Thanks
124530,charlied,2007-10-18 00:46:00,584,pretty much just the Niagara River around this area.  There are some small streams but hold pretty much just chubs.
124545,dheitzner,2007-10-18 01:24:00,314,"i would have thought that a bunch of the rivers out that way would have salmon and trout runs.  look on a map and see what creeks here are from jordan station (on the QEW) to niagara.  i believe some if not all would have seasonal runs of trout and salmon, just be sure to check the regs before you head out, i'm not sure of the open seasons down there.  the niagara is also a great river to fish, in a class all its own."
124566,spanky,2007-10-18 04:11:00,195,pretty much everything inland is closed for the season... niagara river and port D are the only choices in the niagara region i can think of
