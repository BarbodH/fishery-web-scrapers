125268,irishfield,2007-10-20 23:01:00,26272, We use to go into a farm field on Big Bay Point rd that had a creek about a foot wide and a foot deep running thru it. The first time i was taken there I thought the guy was nuts...but we ate well on specs/brookies.

Hiking an overgrown stream bank and plunking a worm/splitshot presentation into likely looking holes is as much fun as you could want.  As long as you scale down your gear to the fish, it's a real hoot.  Enjoy exploring those streams.  Unfortonately, most would be out of season for brookies now, but on opening day..  Cheers."
