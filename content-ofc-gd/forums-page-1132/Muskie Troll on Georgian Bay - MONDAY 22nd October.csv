125427,Whopper,2007-10-21 17:38:00,2174,back up seat? something I can't even handle right now
125447,irishfield,2007-10-21 20:22:00,26272,"Thanks Lew..and sorry you missed it. It will give a couple guys a chance to see what it's like though and hopefully we find a big gal or three!  Had planned to get out at least once a week until the BOQ G2G'r in November, but I just had a guy from Montreal drop an airplane off yesterday...and he'd like his engine changed, from an auto conversion to a lycoming, and a lot of other stuff he'd like done before late next Month...so that might put a kybosh on that idea!  And Phil...what can I say other than behave yourself so you're ready for a full season next year Bud !"
