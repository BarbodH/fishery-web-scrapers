43876,OhioFisherman,2007-03-06 19:06:00,6623,"I know there was a thread about compact florescent bulbs(cfl), I get most of mine at home depot. They usually have some kind of specials with a 6 pack of 60w or a 4 pack of 100w equivelent bulbs for under 10 bucks(ya I am cheap)  Had problems with some of them, put them in and they don`t work for long, turn off and on  by themselves if you leave the power on or just stop working in a short period of time.  I thought home depot`s return policy was kind of lame, two bulb`s stop working?you have to return all 6 or 4 to get replacements, which in my opinion might defeat the purpose of using them, conserving energy. I mark mine with a b for bad if they stop and was returning them, didn`t want to get into the hassle of ""oh you waited too long"".  The bulbs have a customer service number of them, I called and they(distributor) sent new ones! Just asked for the lot and serial numbers, no hassle took less than a week! LOL Ya I need to fish!"
