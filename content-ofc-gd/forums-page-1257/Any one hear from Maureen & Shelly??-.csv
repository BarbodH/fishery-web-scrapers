Thankfully with my nephew there I didn't have to make the drive so I am staying at my aunts house up the road from my work.   Thanks for thinking of me though.  My boyfriend was on his way to work and got stuck southbound between 88 and 89 just after it all happened.  He called me at 5 and had already been sitting for 2 1/2 hrs, he suggested I stay in the city.  My friend also called to suggest the same thing.  First time in 5 years living north of T.O. that I didn't make it home...don't think I like it much other than my aunt has highspeed  Hope everyone else is safe...time for a roll call from the northern group???

My daughter stayed in a hotel last Thursday during the storm rather than face all the headaches on the hiway....sometimes it's just not worth the chance."
