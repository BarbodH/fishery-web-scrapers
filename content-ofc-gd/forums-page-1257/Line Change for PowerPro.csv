43832,trapshooter,2007-03-06 17:12:00,1234," What lb. test PP are you using?  Maybe the really small diameter 10 lb. stuff gets worn down faster but I have 30 lb pp on my jigging rod and it's strong after 2 years guiding 120 days a year.  At the minimum  you can reverse it.  Not very often more then 30 yards of it is out at a time so  you can also strip off some of the frayed/discoloured line at the beginning of the spool.  I agree with the mono spools, they don't last a month for me either with daily use."
43314,Golfisher,2007-03-05 15:03:00,586,"For those of you using braided lines, do you guys change them every year as you would do with mono lines?  I got three of my reels spooled with PowerPro last spring; wondering if I should get them replaced for the new season."
43316,lew,2007-03-05 15:05:00,12767,"PP lasts a long time and you'll get at least a couple years out of it, then remove it all and reverse it, and you'll then get another couple years.  Nothing like mono."
43318,duber,2007-03-05 15:11:00,220,I only replace it if it looks like it needs it.Usally lasts me a couple years.I found a good use for the used stuff.I use it as thread for sewing up ripped work clothes ect.Makes for unrippable repairs.
43319,woodro,2007-03-05 15:12:00,168,"well it depends on how much you use it, Ive done what lew said(reverse the line) and basically saved from buying another spool. But if you have the money for new line and its going to boost your confidence, why not ?"
43322,trapshooter,2007-03-05 15:16:00,1234,"1 year old pp should give you all the confidence in the world.  Save your money, it's still good."
43324,Golfisher,2007-03-05 15:17:00,586,"Cool, so I got at least another year's use left.  Thanks for the replies."
43328,lew,2007-03-05 15:22:00,12767," Nope, you've got 3 more years  left.  One more year the way you are, then reverse it and go for 2 more years.  Now you've got lotsa $$$$ in your pocket for more baits"
43341,musky66,2007-03-05 16:07:00,273,"Yep, Lews right again! I run the same line for several years- throughout the season I trim it back if it begins to look frayed or fuzzy and every other year I swap ends. I also have found I can use the same floro leader all season if I keep checking it for bad nicks or cuts. I can almost rationalize the cost savings to the wife!"
43342,Zib,2007-03-05 16:09:00,369,No need to change it. Braided line is good for 3 plus years. If it gets too frayed on the end then reverse it on your spool.
43400,Fishn Technishn,2007-03-05 18:41:00,198,"If your Powerpro starts to lose its colour, just use whatever magic marker you want to colour it up for a while! I use old Powerpro for tying my bucktails! Amazingly strong!  FT"
43402,Beans,2007-03-05 18:58:00,3339,"I gotta agree with Lew...  For the price of braid, I'd want at least 4 years of service from it...  It's not that I'm cheap....just poor"
43454,GbayGiant,2007-03-05 20:52:00,1780,"Yup, some people buy mono for the cost and think the braid is to pricey, but the braid will be cheaper in the long run when your still using it 6 years down the road."
43462,mattyk,2007-03-05 21:01:00,2110,I have had mine now for two years and its still working great. I may take Lews adivice and reverse it.
43474,charlesn,2007-03-05 21:16:00,551,"I respool braid once a season.  Mostly for peace of mind, but also because I usually have at least one mother of a pterodactyl nest and being a knucklehead, my only backlash removal technique involves yanking on the braid and either getting it free or digging it so far down into the spool that the rod and reel go back in to the rod locker for more extreme maintenance at home.  I find that the best backlashes occur when you hook something on your backcast just as you are trying to make a monster cast to a splash or fish that you just saw surface.  Use lots of mono backing on your spool and just put enough braid on there so that you don't ever get down to your backing on your longest cast.  Sometimes you see people with 200 yards of braid on their spool.  Not really sure that is really necessary.  I can spool 2 baitcasters per filler spool of Power Pro or Stren Super Braid.  Charles"
43518,Rich Clemens,2007-03-05 22:46:00,3131,"I used to replace mine every year ... out of habit I guess.   This time I just left it on, but may consider reversing before I head out.   We'll see how she goes."
43532,Tybo,2007-03-05 23:07:00,1373,"I have some on a pike set up. Been on so long I can't remember the test and it's all white. HAs to be 5,6 years old."
43549,glirw,2007-03-05 23:27:00,200,"You'd probably need a separate bank loan to replace the braid on 4-5 reels annually, that stuff's expensive !  I have 3 reels spooled up , and the line is in great condition for at least a few more seasons."
43557,Abberz,2007-03-05 23:34:00,140,"  Great advise Lew, you beat me to it!  On the topic of mono, I am loving the fluro that is available now.....worth a try for those that haven't used it instead of mono."
43573,carll2,2007-03-05 23:54:00,443,does this apply also for fireline or spiderwire?
43605,xrap,2007-03-06 01:00:00,683,"Strongest stuff I have ever used, even when I get snags i just keep pulling and end up breaking the hook or pulling out the log. The coulor fades away after about 6-8 months but I guess it still has the same strength. Just wished it was a bit cheapier"
43639,DMASSE,2007-03-06 02:13:00,420,"Hey ofners  Did you know that power pro now come in a blood red,  I personally havent used it yet, but the rep was telling me that it dissapears  in 10ft or more water..  going to try it my elf now thats its at the store...  Dave"
43657,Dabluz,2007-03-06 02:41:00,701," Your rep has distorted the facts a bit.  Yes the colour of red disappears quite quickly in the water column.  It just turns ""black"".  The object no longer reflects red.  It gets darker and darker as it sinks deeper until it turns ""black"".  Red mono does the same thing."
43681,tomO,2007-03-06 03:51:00,363,Do red hooks do the same thing? and if they do whats the point?
43685,Hooked,2007-03-06 04:04:00,891,"  Excellent question!  Think that may deserve another thread?  I also do what most others do, use, reverse...."
43804,steverowbotham,2007-03-06 16:20:00,1800,"I fish 15-20 tournaments a year, plus guiding, plus recreational fishing, I'm on the water well over 100 days a year.  Power Pro I replace twice a season, and fluoro/mono i replaced AT LEAST monthly."
