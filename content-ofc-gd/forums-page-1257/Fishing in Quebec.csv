42137,nelly,2007-03-02 16:50:00,256,"Thinking of fishing for some walleyes in Quebec during the late spring. This would be a 3 night, 4 day trip. Need a change of scenery. Any comments from these two resorts. Price seems reasonable. They both have exclusive rights and not sure what the access fee might be?  http://clubtroutlake.com/territoire.html  http://domaineshannon.com/territory.html"
42156,darsky,2007-03-02 17:33:00,586,been to Shannon a few years back. Nice place. Just dont go for the opener. Can be very hit and miss at that time of year.Cabins are fine with electricity-camp is run off a main generater. Main lake(Seguin) has tons of walleyes some big and poss for huge pike to 30 lbs. Great thing is you can drive to dozens of other lakes in there territory. They have a catch/release trophy lake but you MUST hire a guide to go there. Good place for the $$. I will be going back sometime.
42255,majorlifts,2007-03-02 21:23:00,171,"I have been to Domain de deux ours, when I was younger. nice cabins beautiful lodge, lots of pike and bass. I dont know if its still there but it was really off the beatin path, and very inexpensive."
42331,Marc Thorpe,2007-03-02 23:45:00,621,Nelly Domain Shannon is a good place to go Serge Danis will take good care of  a film crew I work has filmed there in the pass and the facilities are very good and fishing is excellent  marc
42336,carll2,2007-03-02 23:52:00,443,like darsky said dont go on opener its very hit and miss with snow beeing had alot of the times
42418,Mike the Pike,2007-03-03 02:47:00,3421,Friends of mine have been to Domaine Shannon.They were happy fisherman.
42439,fishindevil,2007-03-03 03:33:00,6254,"hey guys i was just wondering what part of western quebec is this place located,i have heard of this place and i am curious,as to where these lakes are....cheers"
42499,Roy,2007-03-03 09:56:00,13728,"I've been to Shannon several times. Want lotsa walleye, that's a good place to go. If I remember correctly, the last time I was there it cost me $309.00 for four days. Pretty dang reasonable and the fishing was excellent."
42514,Marc Thorpe,2007-03-03 12:27:00,621,"FD,here's the map of the area shown where Shannon is located  http://domaineshannon.com/road.html"
42556,Tomcat,2007-03-03 14:26:00,395,"Of all the walleye outfitters in western Quebec, how did you happen to find out about these two in particular? Did you visit their booths at a fishing show?"
42565,darsky,2007-03-03 14:53:00,586,"Roy,for over 3 bills-did you take the meals deal?We brought our own food and kept the costs down. Also keep in mind their package deals include a boat but you must pay for a motor and gas daily. Kind of like a legend boat package if you ask me. They should make their prices accordingly including the WHOLE package. Tomcat-most of the replies in this thread are from Montrealers."
42566,nelly,2007-03-03 14:54:00,256,"Thanks for all your comments and help guys. Do any of you know the daily cost for access fee for exclusive right?  Tomcat-I have only fish in Quebec once before and that was in the spring of 1999. The outfitter that we use was great and the fishing was excellent but has been sold in the recent years. The new place is too fancy and with higher price. It is located way back in the remote area of the La Verendrye Reserve. This is why I prefer to look for other outfitters around this area. The two main region are Abitibi-Temiscamingue and Outaouais.  I will bump up the other thread for you in order to get more info, along with a free road map and 2007 outfitters guide book."
42667,Tomcat,2007-03-03 19:38:00,395,Nelly:  Sent you a PM this afternoon.  Tomcat
43488,carll2,2007-03-05 21:48:00,443,nelly for 3 hours more drive from mont laurier you can go to the gouin reservoir which is also a very good location for walleye all year round/ if you want info pm me
43660,Dabluz,2007-03-06 02:49:00,701,"Gouin Reservoir....lots of walleyes but small in size.  Slot limits are unheard of here in Quebec.  Most of the time, I hear ""put back the small fish and keep the big fish"".  I guess that someday, someone is going to wake up.  However, you can have a lot of fun renting a house boat.  If you want large walleyes, go to Ontario where there are slot limits.  You can eat walleye until you burst and have fun catching and releasing large walleyes."
43705,carll2,2007-03-06 07:07:00,443,it depends where on gouin you go to..the sector i fish averages walleye between 2-4lbs and its rare you see people but a houseboat might be some fun
