43632,GbayGiant,2007-03-06 02:04:00,1780,"  Got a Cabela's spring catalogue in the mail today and drooled all over it and seen this, I think I'll wait for a few years of reviews before I take the plunge in this one, what's next ? a personal robot to fish for you while you sip a cold one ?     $499 US"
43636,mepps,2007-03-06 02:09:00,1301,"Its actaully a few years old already and has solid reviews as well! review: http://www.tackletour.com/reviewshimanocalcuttatedc.html  I almost picked one up in 2004, but they didnt have the left hand model in store. (just aswell, my VISA bill was(is) too big) Personally, i'd like to see a slightly larger version come out.   The newset version is the low profile one...cost is about $650    review: http://tackletour.com/reviewshimanocalaisdcreview.html"
43638,MJL,2007-03-06 02:12:00,2427,Here's a review from 2004  http://tackletour.com/reviewshimanocalcuttatedc.html
43640,GbayGiant,2007-03-06 02:14:00,1780,"They don't care about lefties.  Cool links guys (where have I been this is old news), I wouldn't mind trying one out for a day."
43642,mepps,2007-03-06 02:18:00,1301,The guy at BPS actually told me that didnt make a left handed verion.  I asked to borrow their catelog and pointed out that they did.
43646,crusty,2007-03-06 02:27:00,83,"Saw a link on japan market Shimano a few weeks ago.. Thought it was on this site They were offering an upgraded version of this reel looked like solid gold Enough to make a grown man drool. ""IF I HAD A MILLION DOLLARS"""
43653,Terry,2007-03-06 02:35:00,14456,yeah the new Calais 4x8 DC is very cool and many more bells and whistles  and some pretty good deals on ebay for them
43655,mepps,2007-03-06 02:38:00,1301,Just check out this page if you want to blow money on expensive reels!  http://japantackle.com/
43658,GbayGiant,2007-03-06 02:44:00,1780,"Wow, that Daiwa Ishidai Z looks killer. To bad reels don't have lifetime warranties like rods, I wouldn't mind dropping some more cash on them.  They consider 6 years a life time warranty I was reading, not bad but you would have to ship it back to Japan."
43672,mattyk,2007-03-06 03:20:00,2110,"I think that Daiwa Ishidai Z was $950, thats insane."
43676,char finder,2007-03-06 03:42:00,12,"I have the left handed model 201 te dc and it is trully amazing. You can chuck your bait out a mile with no backlash. Just don't try using it for flipping as you will get a backlash. The chip does not operate well for flipping baits. There is some small adjustments that you should make which are dependant on bait weight and wind, but it is much simpler than other reels that i have had. Very smooth reel!"
