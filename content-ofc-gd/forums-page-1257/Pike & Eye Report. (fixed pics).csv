43423,Moosebunk,2007-03-05 19:58:00,3970,"January got out once.  Big trip on the skidoo 165 km’s return for the shot at some good speckled trout fishing.  Arrived at Halfway Creek 80 km’s up the winter road from Moosonee to Fort Albany, to find the ice road workers had dammed the creek to create a large pool at roadside so which they could fill their trucks with the water.  Water they in turn use to flood and smooth sections of this winter highway.  Needless to say, the water on the lower section of the creek; where we fish, was greatly affected.  My buddy Paul and I had hoped an incoming tide off James Bay scheduled for about 3 pm would still bring a fresh school of searun trout, but, an offshore wind during a new moon cycle didn’t really help with that either.  We went fish-less, but enjoyed the riding.     By the end of January a new “PikeSlayerinator” was born too.    Through February tied some musky bucks and four attempts at pike were made.    The growing number of ice anglers around here, and the bad freeze-up around one of my usual walleye spots forced me further upriver.  First day out ended in huge disappointment as a big pike was lost during the sunset.  About 5:15 I was packing up and on my way over to grab my set rod.  The tip dropped an inch suddenly, and just remained there for a second.  I started to run and the reel began peeling, when I grabbed it there was very likely the heaviest Moose River fish on the end of the line I had ever felt.  We played for what seemed like 10 minutes and did make a couple passes at the hole, yet it wouldn’t turn and eventually snapped 30lb braid.  I sunk into the snow crushed for a second, then ran over to the skidoo for another spoon, rigged it quick, went back and started jigging the hole, but came up empty.  I’m pretty convinced it was a bite-off above the leader, but, when fishing through nearly 3 feet of ice and in only about 2 feet of water, there’s always the great chance that the line running and rubbing at pretty much a right angle with the bottom of the hole is reason enough for the line to get cut.  While there though I did manage to pick up four snot rockets as some sort of consolation prize yet, dropped the camera in a hole and totaled it.  Did manage to retrieve the disk though... for it’s 3rd time in about 1 ½ years.  Remember that, they’re reason alone to grab the camera from the water.   It's been a cold month.  A week later I returned for that big fish.  It was a cold sunny day and a friend of mine John and his wife flying their plane landed where I was so to come over and talk awhile with me.  Throughout the afternoon I picked up just one small pike and it was so slow I laid back on the skidoo for a wee siesta while the sun was setting.  After about 20 minutes I hear a little crack in the ice from the hole beside the skidoo.  One eye open I see that the tip of my rod has dropped just an inch and is sitting there very still-like.  I spring up, grab the rod from it’s holder on the skidoo and set the hook.  Immediately it feels like a good fish, not like “the” fish, but a good one, so I put some pressure on it when suddenly my reel screams for just an instant, then snap.  Again, 30lb test braid broken off, and again, I sink into the snow crushed and really quite bothered by this second loss.     Waiting only 1 day to get back there this time when I arrived two locals were on my spot with about 20 rods down.  I had only brought the hand auger so to just open my pre-drilled holes but these fellas had those taken up.  Could say, I was miffed, but I went over to politely say hello anyways.  Always ask, “catch any,” and so sure enough one lad motions me over to his box sled and points out a 3 lb. walleye and 1 wee snake.  Then, he tells me about 15 minutes earlier they nearly lost a rod and it’s holder down a hole to a big fish that got off.  “Yeah, is that right” I say then ask... “Mind if I borrow your gas auger?”  One moochacho says “it’s kinda dull,” a comment that nearly had me clench my left... being that I just traveled 30 km’s on skidoo, had a crappy and dull hand auger of my own that wasn’t going to be drilling through 3 feet... twice, and, two local yokels were putting me in a bad mood.  Just then though, my buddy Francis who I wasn’t sure was joining me for a fish, comes late around the point.  “See yas doods.”  Francis at hello says, “I knew I was following your tracks, double carbides on each ski.”  Francis and I got set-up and over the afternoon he did well picking up six pike to my four.  I had to work the midnight shift, had been out since just after lunch, and couldn’t wait around for that big fish and it’s 5:15 bite, besides, I had a chill in me for about 2 hours and was feeling the need to get home and get warm.  All the pike were pretty much weenies anyways.    This past Sunday I headed back there with my eldest Summer.  I think she likes skidoo rides more than fishing.  Two new fellas were sitting on my old holes now with about 20 rods down and they complained the fishing was slow.  We got to the other spot nearby and first words out of Summer’s mouth, “Dad, I’m really sweaty now.”  I drill four holes and get the lines down when she says, “Dad, my feet are getting cold.”  “Keep moving around Summer” I tell her.  After about only an hour with 2-3 to go Summer says from her perch sitting on the skidoo, “Dad, I’m cold.”  Now, Dad knows to dress his kids to the max when taking them out.  In fact, Summer has handled colder than this many a times.  She’s a real trooper too and not usually one to complain.  I got a blanket out, she was being lazy anyway and so I covered her up while she laid on the skidoo.  About 10 minutes later she says she’s warmer then falls asleep.    An hour goes by and I’m doing great with three snot rockets caught.  It’s nearing the magic hour for that big pike.  A northeast wind is building a little, while the suns heading down, then Summer wakes up.  “How ya doing kiddo?” I ask.  “Dad, I’m really cold, as she starts to cry.”  My mind goes ARRRRRRGGHHHHHH!  “OK Summer, just a wee bit longer.  You gotta get up and start moving around to warm up.” “I can’t” she says.  So I put her on her feet and she’s shaking like a leaf.  DING DING goes the bell on the Slayerinator.  “MOVE AROUND!” I yell as I’m running over to the tip-down to pull up a dink eye.  Get back to her, that’s it, I’m packing up, worried about the ride home against that wind.  On the way home drove by my usual walleye spot at Kwetabohagan to see about 30 people fishing a space about 50m squared. (Later told it was about 60 people during that afternoon)  Back at home, hot chocolate, a blanket and mom’s long bear hug warmed Summer’s bones.  Remember that sweat is your enemy.  Yesterday slipped out to Kwetabohagan for some walleye.  Had the place to myself and tonnes of holes only thinly frozen over to choose from.  Just punched a couple easy enough.  Nice day to be out, mainly sunny and warm but with a slight north wind that could come along now and then and getcha.  Things started slow and during the afternoon I found myself taking a ½ hour nap on the skidoo.  Finally around 4:00 a school must have roamed on in as I caught the rod tip bounce.    Picked up for a jiggle and nothing.  Put the rod just so it sat on the skidoo seat kind of teetering and could fall off with the lightest tug, and was quick to pick up a nice eater fish when the tip dipped.  Not wasting time I gave this another go after baiting, dropping down, giving a jig, then setting the rod to teeter.  Sure enough, fish.  Repeated the process 5 times, releasing the third fish as it was too small for supper, and happily when the bite ended I had my limit.  Packing up, a gang load came skidooing along the path that lead the 10 km’s up to the pike spot.  Glad I was to have chosen a different venue for the day.    When I got home after getting things put away and letting the fish thaw out a little, this blue slime on two of the fish was evidently thick.  Caught two blue walleyes before regardless of what specialists and authorities say about it, but these were the first 2 blue slime walleye that I’ve read about in OOD.    Back at the grind for a short while today in nice warm weather, again the place was barren of others.  Just after dropping the lines around 2 pm I was into an eye.  Over the two hours I caught only 3 and lost a small one atop the hole, but, didn’t much care as it was good to be catching something anyway.  "

43430,Moosebunk,2007-03-05 20:15:00,3970,Tried it anew elsewhere and had the same prob.  Likely something with pbucket right now.  Try again later.
43432,Raf,2007-03-05 20:17:00,3495,"consider using www.imageshack.us .  I've had better luck with it than photobucket.. and they don't block it at work for me.  Wayne, I thought you're going to the shop so you can go boating in the summer."
43433,Chuck Best,2007-03-05 20:18:00,308,We'll be waiting.........
43434,snag,2007-03-05 20:18:00,1932, Please be rapido.  It is winter and we are starving
43448,irishfield,2007-03-05 20:41:00,26272," Yah...and then I filed a health and safety concern with my boss...that I might get blown down while crossing the ""venturi"" between the house and the shop. It's in the greivence stage right now...and I think I'll have about an hour before she kicks my ass out the door to at least find the laneway with the plow!"
43693,Moosebunk,2007-03-06 04:40:00,3970,"Now she's a go.  Easy fix.  Pre-game show this is.  On ice for the big stuff this month.  Can't wait, hooks all sharpened and some replaced today.  New leaders, questionable line trashed.  Shouldn't be any excuses for not getting a big pike this weekend..... unless they don't bite."
43707,carll2,2007-03-06 07:18:00,443,awesome report moosebunk like usuall is that a summit 700 you have?is she reliable..im looking into a longtrack for my up north ice fishing excursions.
43709,Moosebunk,2007-03-06 07:37:00,3970,"Renegade 600.  Reliable.............. never had a prob, just rolled over 6000km.  Not as much a Summit fan as the Renegade, although either are good machines.  Like my slightly wider ski stance and the happy medium between trail and powder."

43744,Basskicker,2007-03-06 12:53:00,421,Thanks for taking the time to share....I plan on being up just southeast of Kesagami the 1st week of june.  I would love to try the ice fishing up that way.  Two years ago we went up on May 22 and the lake that we fish was still iced over......so we headed back south.  Do you know approx. when the ice went last year? Thanks  Jason

43905,Moosebunk,2007-03-06 19:57:00,3970," Yeah Mike, should be a couple reports coming this month.  Praying for good weather and the minnow bans to not pose any challenges.  I sure hope monster fish co-operate too.  CCMT - this report spanned out and was a work in progress for some time.  When ready to post it didn't take too much work in one sitting."
43910,Smokey,2007-03-06 20:11:00,1278,Great i'll be looking for it.
