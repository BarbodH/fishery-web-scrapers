43800,Headhunter,2007-03-06 16:03:00,5703,"Ok... I've personally never fished there, but I know my brother goes up to a buddies cottage there atleast twice a year. This is what he tells me; -tons of smallish walleye... right off the dock, just about anywhere! -jig/minnow combo or jig and plastic combo - deadly -tons of smallish pike - good eaters -very big lake, I believe somewhat horseshoe shaped - a reservoir system -the road in off the highway can be tricky and is a long drive... make sure you have enough fuel to get in and out as you don't want to fill yer vehicle up at the marina! That's about all I can give you. Hope it helps! HH"
