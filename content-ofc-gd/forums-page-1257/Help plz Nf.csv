43906,SIMCOEBOB,2007-03-06 20:02:00,29,Take it from me---I was already there. It helps with with my sales postion in getting better--My wife aways hates me for this. But I tell her it's not far away and lets have dinner and then I can have some fun. yes you walk in and they greet you with application form to fill out. of course it's never true what I put down and then your host comes out and you sit for 90min well it was more like 2 hrs.Then a good dinner--they hurry you up. I like sitting in the front so I can show off my tallent so far. the wife just shakes her head and keeps from laughing outloud.You know when the bulls--t starts right away that I have a trip for you...these sales people must go to some ernest angley school--now they don't smack you until the bitter end when you refuse--I like that part--I went through 6 sales people that night and still come home with a trip--oh yea there is a catch there also--the trip is you get there--orlando --you pay the difference per night because you chose in season and of course the taxs--did we forget taxs. Anywasy I come away more smarter again--but time wasted in my wifes view...take it from me--nothing is for free and never will be..just tell them you already won a trip to newzealand and your leaving next week--give it to some other sap. and if your still keen on going send me $10.00 and I will forward our free trip..cheers  simcoebob  P.S.  remember at these events your bulls..t has to be better then theres
42819,xrap,2007-03-04 01:27:00,683,"We got a phone call today saying we won a 42"" plazma and trip. We asked how we won it he said a couple weeks back my sister took a survey about something and her name was entered into a draw. He told us a confirmation code and a claim number and gave us a address to pick it up. I didn't really beilieve it so i searched thier number on google and got this site. Is this a scam or what. The distance to drive is one hour away from here so it wouldn't be worth driving for nothing. Anyone any help?   http://www.canadianuniversal.com/companyinfo_where.html"
42821,Terry,2007-03-04 01:32:00,14456,"my guess is you go go inside the building and someone will tell you to wait over there till you are called.... they will make you sit through a long seminar, on time shares or property in Florida  or something like that...."
42822,Clampet,2007-03-04 01:33:00,1947,"Take the drive. You have nothing to lose, except fer the gas money."
42825,GbayGiant,2007-03-04 01:38:00,1780,"Call them back and ask specific questions, If you think it's legit take the drive."
42826,SlowPoke,2007-03-04 01:39:00,2984,It could be a scam but it's probably a marketing scheme. As long as you don't hand over personal information or have to pay anything it could be worth your time to check it out. Terry is likely right... you may have to sit through a sales pitch for something. -Brian
42831,express168,2007-03-04 01:45:00,327,"It appears to be a members club for travel and products. They will likely try to get you to buy an expensive membership, after you sit through a lengthy presentation. Leave your credit and debit cards at home so that you don't fall for the PRESSURED sales pitch and make sure they pay up with the prize as promised at the end."
42845,TennesseeGuy,2007-03-04 02:35:00,957,Sometimes it's a method for bringing in criminals.  They show up for their free Plasma and get bracelets instead.  In my neighborhood they were lured in with hopes of picking up a free laptop computer.  At least one arrest was a case of having the wrong person.
42848,canadian_copper,2007-03-04 02:47:00,925,SCAM SMELL ALL OVER IT!!! HAD A FEW OF THOSE PLACES PHONE MY PLACE!!
42849,PatrickGG,2007-03-04 02:49:00,562,I would go but be careful if they want alot of personal info i would be concerned.
42857,charlied,2007-03-04 03:12:00,584,got a phone call like that except for a trip....did only part of a survey online and cancelled out of it....a day later get a call for a week stay at universal studios..blah blah blah...sit in an info thing....they said it was worth $2000 and I could have it for $349  for 4 people but had to pay over the phone right htere...ya right!  Do what the one person on  here said leave personal crap at home!
42860,xrap,2007-03-04 03:21:00,683,"Thanks for the info everyone, I'll warn my parents to leave all personal info at home"
42864,Joey,2007-03-04 03:36:00,9122,That site just crashed my computer  I couldn't get out of it or minimize it.  Joey
42884,urbanangler1990,2007-03-04 04:56:00,933,"id check it out, either they give u the prize or ask too many questions and get to personal, then get outta there, ye dont give out private info"
42899,Castmaster,2007-03-04 07:09:00,86,I saw that on TV. They nailed a whole whack of people who had outstanding warrants. Slick move if you ask me.
43025,aplumma,2007-03-04 20:37:00,6896,Basic economics demands that they get something of greater value than the product they are giving away. Since they already got the survey information without promising you an entry into a contest why would they give you a TV and TRIP for something they already have? I don't know what the hook is but it is their I personally would go so I could report to OFC what I found out but only go realizing that the TV and Trip are very unlikly to be free.   Art
43030,irishfield,2007-03-04 21:01:00,26272,They're free if you buy the time share unit Art ! LOL  I'm first hand to this sheeeet with a Brother-in-law that's one of the sleeze balls that sell such things...and as matter of fact I may even like him a little bit come next fall... as they are being moved to the Dominican Republic to live and sell units on the North Shore there... Free accoms and cheapflights.com here we come LOL..
43204,JerseyDog,2007-03-05 03:46:00,190,Walk away. Scam.  You won't get what you think you are getting but you might end up mortgaging your future for two weeks every year in a lovely little resort on the pristine shores of the Tigris.
43457,ryanheritage,2007-03-05 20:57:00,180,Take the drive!!!!!  and bring something to sell them.... But they have to buy today!!!!
43528,Deano,2007-03-05 23:01:00,767,"Someones gonna catch a fish. And your gonna be the fish.LOL I can't beleive posters telling you to go, no wonder these scam artists will never go away. What's the old saying, if it sounds to good to be true, well never mind. Happy fishing."
43540,Roy,2007-03-05 23:17:00,13728,I would go with Chevy 4X4 and Slowpoke. Make sure they wear sunglasses and a suit.
43569,Bly,2007-03-05 23:50:00,1556,  and whenever they ask you a question..nod to Chevy and Slowpoke to answer for you
43730,Big Cliff,2007-03-06 11:55:00,6899,Thanks!   Just spewed coffee all over my monitor and keyboard with the thought of that one LOL.
43802,Beans,2007-03-06 16:16:00,3339,"Me?...I'd rather borrow Meely's Uncle Vinnie (The Chin) and Guido to cover my back...  BTW...do any here receive air mail letters from Australia, Singapore, Hong Kong, and The Netherlands asking to confirm name and address and to send $40 or $50 along with reply on the off chance you may have won a sweepstake or entitled to a share of $millions from estates???  Next ones are going back to the post office as I've got enough paper ahead for fire starter..."
43892,jnic,2007-03-06 19:27:00,158,maybe call and see if they deliver
43895,tonyb,2007-03-06 19:32:00,1637,"Exactly, if it was a real prize you have won, they can ship it to you.  SCAM  Also heads up to people filling out Draw prize cards at shows, this is a simple way for companies to mine personal information from people for free.  They turn around and sell your contact information to the highest bidders, then you get phone calls like ""You've won a Plasma!"" lol  Never give out your phone number or address information at any retail outlet either.  Be smart people.  That information is very valuable to companies looking to mass market their wares...  Tony"
