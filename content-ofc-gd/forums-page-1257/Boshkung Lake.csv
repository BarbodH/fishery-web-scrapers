They are a class act up there and highly recommend anyone that is looking for an ice fishing get-a-way this weekend to give them a call. The cottage we had booked (which is now open of course) had 4 bedrooms and slept 8 with 7 different beds, and oh yeah there is a hot tub on the deck.  PM me for more details or give them a call at 1-888-368-3147.  Hopefully someone can take advantage of the weekend, looks like it will be nice.  Mark"

44290,Mark Cavanaugh,2007-03-07 17:51:00,3,"Good idea Tony,  The price for the weekend is $550 for the 8 man cottage, not bad considering the ammenities. For an extra $30/person they give you a heated hut and all the bait you can handle.  Mark"
