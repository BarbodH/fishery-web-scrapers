43608,bucktail,2007-03-06 01:08:00,1857,God I HATE March!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
43656,DT10Sam,2007-03-06 02:38:00,480,"March is unpredictable and the weather does look promising in the next couple of weeks.  Regards, Sam"
43725,Big Cliff,2007-03-06 11:31:00,6899,"Yesterday morning about this time the same long range forcast showed way below normal temps for most of March.  Yesterday afternoon, 680 news was saying temperatures for March should be about normal.  This morning, the long range forcast looks like someone just flipped it upside down!  Why am I so confused?"
43727,lew,2007-03-06 11:39:00,12767,"I can tell you one thing, that warming trend hasn't quite started yet.  I was outside for awhile this morning and just got in and it's definetly still winter.....  ........-31 windchill......brrrrrrrr......don't forget yer woolies"
43729,solopaddler,2007-03-06 11:45:00,8605,"Too true Lew, just got back from my shift at the weather office, temp (without windchill) was -22. Hope everyone's got a strong battery in their car"
