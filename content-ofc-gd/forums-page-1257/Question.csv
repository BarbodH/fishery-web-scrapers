43602,xrap,2007-03-06 00:54:00,683,For the tourney does a silver bass count under the bass category or panfish? Thanks
43794,ehg,2007-03-06 15:39:00,2666,I was thinking the same thing! Maybe they don't count in the tourney? Here is a nice pic of one. 
43799,Terry,2007-03-06 15:55:00,14456,no they don't large and small mouth only
43806,Headhunter,2007-03-06 16:23:00,5703,"That is a good sized ""White Perch"" you caught there! HH"
43807,steverowbotham,2007-03-06 16:28:00,1800,"bass tournaments include ""black bass"" which are largemouth, smallmouth and spotted bass."
43809,Tdel,2007-03-06 16:34:00,393,"It is not a white perch HH.  It is a ""White Bass"" or ""Silver Bass"".  White Perch colour isn't as silver and don't have dark horizontal lines on its sides.  The white perch I have seen have a yellowish tint to their silver colour.  Tom"
43814,Headhunter,2007-03-06 16:43:00,5703,"I've had this discussion many times regarding Silver Bass/White Perch... and I certainly won't argue with you! LOL Either way, it's a good size, too bad they are not very good table fare. HH"
43828,misfish,2007-03-06 17:06:00,29133,So why the hybrid in the bass cat.? Nice silver there. I know where to catch them if they count.LOL
43833,Tdel,2007-03-06 17:20:00,393,"No argument here and I am not looking for one.  Just stating facts, so take a deep breath and relax.  Tom."
43837,Headhunter,2007-03-06 17:33:00,5703,"Tom, I can't get any more relaxed about this topic... I couldn't care less! I do hope though, that you didn't get the wrong immpression from my earlier post! I'm not argueing the point, I believe I accepted your response as being vaild and in no way tried to contravene what you said. Actually, if you look at my response, I included a LOL at the end of my statement. Have a great day all! HH Ps... Walleye....     er    Pickeral!"
