39623,GbayGiant,2007-02-25 01:44:00,1780,"Nice work fellas.  Toss some pink lipstick on Marc and it would have been perfect.  My parents sell fishing mags at their store including this fine one, I'm lucky enough to read them all for free.  Ooops, I mean I get them at cost."
39641,Joey,2007-02-25 02:28:00,9122,"Got my issue Friday when I got home.  Marky Marc on the cover, sheesh.  Read Sandy's piece first, as usual.  Us gals gotta stick together.  Then the piece de resistance, our very own Moosebunk is in this issue too.  Simply awesome.  Congrats to all.  Joey"
43969,Rich Clemens,2007-03-06 22:06:00,3131,"OK.  Now that I have finally received my issue, I wonder if someone would drop me a PM and let me know which OFC'rs are in this issue and which page ?   Not having the priviledge to meet any OFC'er yet, all I know are the board names.   Looking forward to putting a face and story to a name.  Thanks folks."
43994,douG,2007-03-06 23:06:00,2693,"I dunno, something about the right hand and the fins on that fish just don't seem right ( I wanted to be the first).  Moosebunk has been published?  About time, imo.  Goodonya, bunk."
44059,Joey,2007-03-07 00:59:00,9122," Rich, Mark Thorpe is on the cover, Pete Maina is at the top of page 11, Graftongal (Snady) is on page 87 (its a side view tho) and Moosebunk is on page 93.  Hope I haven't missed anybody.  Anyone let me know if I have.  Cheers,  Joey"
44071,Rich Clemens,2007-03-07 01:20:00,3131,Cool. Thanks Joey.  I'll be sure to look for them.  Marc and Pete I would have recongized.
37794,Whopper,2007-02-21 23:01:00,2174,"Well folks just got mine in the mail today and jesh this thing is stuffed with more OFC'ers than you can shake a stick at.

38114,Raf,2007-02-22 05:45:00,3495,"he brought his smile in the boat, didn't he."
38131,Rich Clemens,2007-02-22 11:28:00,3131,"Well, since I've never met anyone personally from the board.  Not yet any way - gonna fix that in about 4 months if everything works as I have it planned.  I'm not sure exactly how many I will be able to idenify based on the board names used here.  After a while, I hope someone can help me out with putting some names to those pics.  Looking forward to receiving my copy."

38888,Pete Maina,2007-02-23 15:44:00,213,"Hi,  Yeah, I still can't figure out that whole cover thing. The guy I know over that way never smiles  It truly is a sad state of affairs ... not my fault either, btw ... Dave Olson is our designer - and you all have him to blame  Glad to hear the dogsleds are starting to arrive all over the continent here.  And seriously, some good stuff ... good to see all the OFNER's ... and yeah, great piece Moosebunk!  Pete"
38901,TennesseeGuy,2007-02-23 16:27:00,957,Wow.  Front cover is quite an accomplishment.  How do you follow this one?  Is a centerfold in the works?
