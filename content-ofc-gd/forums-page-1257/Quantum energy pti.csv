42452,ryanheritage,2007-03-03 03:59:00,180,Just curious if any one has heard anything bad about this reel. I bought a little one from tech tackle.... It seems like its a good deal and I am just curious if anyone has one or knows anything about it? 
42465,Gerritt,2007-03-03 04:45:00,6129,nice little ultralight for panfish!....and it looks nice too!...... isnt fishing 90% looking good while out there? LOL   yeah it is a great real brother... have fun with it!.....nice score!  Gerritt.
42479,huntervasili,2007-03-03 05:22:00,1604,The one really good thing about it is the bail is really flexible... wont break or snap line on ya...
42486,ryanheritage,2007-03-03 06:13:00,180,Not for ultra light im getting the mid size 13 oz.... Its the same size as a shimano 2500 series. I just hope its worth it. I had a spirex for a couple years now and its been soooo good to me. I know its not a high end reel but its been a good reliable reel i even have pulled in a coouple carp on it! I also use a shimano citica.I have had it for a bit too. Another great reliable reel.
42542,JFR,2007-03-03 13:44:00,498,"I have several Quantum spinning reels, and never had a problem.  I actually prefer them to my now sold Abu C3s. Until 3 years ago, was the last remaining reel company still manufacturing in the US. John"
42578,Gerritt,2007-03-03 15:17:00,6129,"I have the pti in an Ultralight.... and I dont have a single complaint about it, Hopefully you'll dig yours as much as I dig mine..  Good luck with your purchase!! Mind if I ask how much?  Gerritt."
42629,taper,2007-03-03 17:32:00,611,I am still trying to decide if I should buy  the Energy PTI or the the Shimano Solstice. I really like the PTI but the Solstice has the rear fighting drag and one handed casting that I also like.
42722,setomonkey,2007-03-03 22:00:00,872,"Not the same reel, but I have the Quantum Kinetic and have really enjoyed fishing with it over the past few years. No complaints at all.  Mike"
42773,Fisherpete,2007-03-03 23:46:00,1814,"I have the Energy PTI size 3 on one of my Muskie rods, and a size 3 Catalyst PTI on the other. (Yes, I use spinning reels for Muskie - hate baitcasters) Both are amazing. I also have a Shimano Stradic 2500, whick was quite a bit more expensive than either of these, and I prefer the Quantum reels. By the way - bass pro shops has a sale on starting next weekend, bring in any used working reel to trade in and you will get a coupon towards a new reel - the more expensive the reel you will buy, the more the coupon is worth... for the Energy PTI I think you will get $25 off for your trade in. (I bought mine at their sale last year doing just this). Have fun! I might be there picking up another Energy myself...  Fisherpete"
42793,ryanheritage,2007-03-04 00:19:00,180,"I am getting the combo with a one peice rod too at BPS total price I think is 199.00 . I am glad that its a good real I have had only one quantum before and I gave it my friend on the water one day when he broke his reel. I had the quantum as a ""extra"" but he never gave it back.lol ( he doenst even catch fish haha mittzu). Thanks for the input guys. I will be using mine typically for team ten to beat the rest of the teams lol. Im getting a little too edgy waiting for open water........."
43352,bigbuck,2007-03-05 16:30:00,2449,"Nice looking reels. I'm considering one in the 2500 size to battle pike and bass. They are silky smooth and if they are anything like my Quantum baitcasters, they'll be a nice addition to your collection."
43534,jeffw,2007-03-05 23:09:00,267,I bought a model 20 for $45 at a hock shop and have found it by far to be the best spinning reel that I have ever used. The guy didn't really know what it was and was supprised at how fast I grabbed it off the shelf. It was also loaded with powerpro 20 lbs. Cheers Jeff
43554,Fishmaster,2007-03-05 23:32:00,920,I have a few PTI and love them ..you get what you pay for and quatum stands behind there warnt ..you won't be disapointed
43560,Abberz,2007-03-05 23:38:00,140,"I love mine. I have the PTI 30, I'll probably buy a 10 or 20 for my ultra-lite for pan fishin' this spring. The anti-reverse is the best I've used on any spinning reel to date."
43596,Rustic-Fisher,2007-03-06 00:38:00,826,"Sweat reel.... Magnetic bail instead of springs. Bail is made of Titanium making it industructable. Finish wont scratch. Most important is the ceramic drag system that is incorperated into the reel(less heat produced on the reel when a fish pulls drag), great for fighting big fish such as steelhead.  Ya got a sweet reel....  Rustic"
43603,mepps,2007-03-06 00:57:00,1301,"I've been using one (e20) sicne they came out .  I'v used alot of spinning reels, and this one is by far the best.  I am a big fan of Quantum in general, but this is more then just a good looking reel.  Woth every penny if you ask me.  I've mainly used mine for bass, walleye and the ocasional pike.  PS. Parts DO scratch, so if you want to keep it pretty dont put it down on rocks or let it bang around in the bottom of the boat like I do..."
43723,cplummer,2007-03-06 11:22:00,165,i use the 20 and 30 PTI and will never look back at another shimano reel again... awesome reel!!! cliff...
