44293,Raf,2007-03-07 17:56:00,3495,I dont normally do this but in this case I think good service and a great price deserve to be mentioned.  Dave got me a great deal on a new camera (Panasonic DMC FZ7).  He got it in for me eventhough (I assume) he doesn't carry the brand and answered all my questions.   A pleasure to talk 'fishn' with as well.
44303,nautifish,2007-03-07 18:18:00,1416,"Thankyou raf i appreciate it.  David thankyou, just happy as hell it has now dissapeared."
38319,trapshooter,2007-02-22 17:53:00,1234,"I couldn't agree with you more MJL.  I just got the D40 myself and it's fantastic.  For an entry level DSLR you won't find a better camera in terms of bang for your buck.  I did a lot of research before buying and all reports gave 2 thumbs up to the D40.  Very user friendly too, with great instant help menu's at the push of a button.  The 18-55mm kit lens is also great but I can't wait to get a zoom... 18-200 or 70-300mm."
38363,nautifish,2007-02-22 19:31:00,1416,Thanx so much for all the replies guy's and Gals very much appreciated. Still have not purchased my new cam yet.......Still doing some reading up.......Want to make sure it is the exact right camera i want before i spend that kind of money.
40229,David Chong,2007-02-26 16:16:00,836,"Nautifish, Feel free to contact me with any questions you might have and whenever you decide on what's best for you we'll see if we can help you out! Lots of web sites with reviews out there! Cheers, Dave"
40246,bpsbassman,2007-02-26 17:06:00,941,"I know its a little below what you're looking for, but I have the Canon S3 and love it.  Have several buddies with the same camera.  You can't beat it for the money."
40356,drufis,2007-02-26 21:45:00,45,"Make sure you check out the D40 before you buy anything, like the rest of the guys said great camera for the money."
40543,sirfish,2007-02-27 05:04:00,175,"Hey David, what is your take on the Fuji S9000 I have the S5200 right now and love it but an upgrade might be in the near future."
40648,David Chong,2007-02-27 15:17:00,836,"Sirfish, Depends on whether you need the additional things that the S9000 will provide for you! 1/ 9.0 Mega-pixel. Better if you're planning on poster size prints or you crop tightly often! 2/ 35mm equivalent 28mm-300mm 10.7X Optical zoom More wide angle less at top end better for landscapes/senics! 3/ Tilting 2"" LCD display. Useful for shooting in unusual positions or over people! 4/ Use of xD or CF cards. Versitility, CF generally less expensive and available in larger capacities. These are the biggest differences! Fujis generally are great value for the money! Hope that this helps! Dave"
40654,Davis Battah,2007-02-27 15:30:00,31,"Nauti...  I researched the Canon and Nikon DSLR lines pretty extensively as I was also in the market.  For a while I was torn between the Canon XTI and the Nikon D80.  Both the cameras are great, and it seamed that all of the head to head comparisons matched them pretty equally.  I personally found the XTI was a little small for my hands and I preferred Canon over the Nikon for a few reasons, the biggest being Canon's IS technology in their lenses.  Nikon lacks comparable image stabilization technology in it's longer lenses and they have been saying for years that they will be bringing their longer lenses up to speed... nothing has happened...(acording to those that have been disappointed for a while).  Because I am going to be mainy shooting wildlife, I ended up choosing the higher model Canon EOS 30D  which is a much faster camera and considerably more rugged.  The other two are mostly if not all plastic but the EOS 30D  has a magnesium-clad body and shoots 5 fps up to 30 frames vs. the XTI which shoots 3 fps up to 27 frames.  One thing is opt out of purchasing the stock 18 - 55 mm lens that these cameras come with, it's useless and upgrade to the 18-85mm lens for an extra couple hundred bucks.  You will be way happy with this better all round lens."
40777,nautifish,2007-02-27 20:27:00,1416,David thankyou so much that is very kind of you.  Davis thanx so much for the info and again to everyone else. You have all been fantabulous  Thankyou so much.
