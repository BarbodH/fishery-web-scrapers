43235,snag,2007-03-05 05:50:00,1932,"Hey HOF,  Funny thing about that. I feel the same way about spinners!  Without seeing you in action, I have noticed some common ailments with these lures.  Time of year Will affect all of the following  1. Depth - It's common to not let the lure sink far enough and/or sink too far for those upward viewing predators. I like to keep the lure just above the weeds most of the season. Easy viewing and pouncing. Shallow spring, deep fall/winter. It's O.K to let the lure sink right to the bottom and bring it up. You will cover all the sight levels this way in case the fish are holding on the bottom or suspending.   2. Speed- Slow most of the time. Technique is everything. Be the lure! I have a signature wrist move that Pee Wee Herman taught me. I sometimes stop reeling half way into a retrieve and go to la-la land to allow the lure to sit/sink and give a stalking fish the chance to pounce or follow. I'm a follow junky. That is a big indication that all of the criteria have been met. My favourite move is to throw a different lure back 20' and reel him/her in.  3. Lure selection - Dark day/water=bright lure(chartruese) Bright clear day=chrome lure I tend to go big on size most of the year (ie- 14 HJ) I prefer suspending and have ""modified"" lures to sink like a rock.   4. Confidence - I like to think: You're special Snag. The fish like you. They appreciate the bait you've chosen for them. The fish are not hungry; they want to be hooked in the face and reeled in, to meet you. Then quickly, respectfully, safely released for another chance rendevous.  5. Observation Is the most important for any lure. If the weather is poor for a jerkbait. Don't bother. You will only find them useless.  I'm sure you've tried all that, but give it a go again. Pm me if you are around town"

43244,Guest skeeter99,2007-03-05 10:55:00,0,"but seriously my best success in retrieve was discovered by accident actually, cast out on quick jerk stop ""take bite of sandwich"" and wham!!!   get some of the kevin van dam videos he shows all different techniques, but most of the time for him and even myself to a degree is long hard fast sweeps with a 3 to 4 second pause, even if fish in negative mood this seems to get them more curious or ticked off and will just hit the bait out of instinct   chrome black back blue black back yellow purple back (really a big fish magnet) baby bass and clown (both these colours have a time and place)  i prefer stick baits with a wide wobble like the storm suspending thunderstick (if u can find any) or husky jerk all in suspending models  I find most other baits wobble is to tight ie. x-rap and others, the wide wobble gets more fish for me anyhow  changing the hooks on the bait will make it run different also, bigger hook on front with a smaller on back will make the bait when it comes to stop *nosedive slowly down* like it is  feeding on the bottom ,drives em nuts"
43645,HUKDONFAWNIX,2007-03-06 02:25:00,135,Wow!  A lot of great feedback!  Thanks everyone.
43776,Zib,2007-03-06 14:13:00,369,When I first started using the Husky Jerks & X-Raps I had limited success myself. I had read articles & watched shows that talked about fishing jerk baits but they were leaving some important stuff out.  When I sat in on Kevin Van Dam’s seminar at a local fishing show he let us in on the secret to catching more fish on jerk baits. He said that you need to jerk the bait on a slack line & not a taught line. He said the bait won’t travel much but the action of the bait is so erratic that fish can’t resist. Well I tried it out last year & my catches on jerk baits more than tripled. KVD is The Man!  Jerk baits really shine in cold front conditions & early & late in the season. Especially for smallmouth. Try the Hot Pink X-Rap early in the season for smallies. They love the pink baits for some reason early on.
42843,Garyv,2007-03-04 02:33:00,547,Oh jerk baits I thought the post read jerk offs and immediately though of the guy that cut me off this afternoon.  On the serious side what Roy said about confidence is so true.  I have lots of confidence in Rapalas and they are always my go to bait when all else fails.  In fact I did just that at lakair last June after nothing seemed to be working. After putting on the Rap well Mr Pike decided to have lunch. After bringing him in I got hooked for the first time in my life.  I can tell you keep your hooks sharp.... as I didn't feel a thing going in until the fish started thrashing about.  As for bombers I've been using them in spring for Salmon for 30+ years still work so they must be good.
42847,charlesn,2007-03-04 02:39:00,551,"When fishing for smallmouth on a warm overcast day that you suspect they are active.  Cast it out there and act like you are having an epileptic seizure.  lol  Absolute erratic thrashing of the bait causing wild crazy movements of the bait is sometimes the best thing.  Got tendonitis from it so it's not my favorite technique, but I can not argue with its effectiveness at times.  Charles  P.S.  Don't give up on the spinnerbait though, that's a great technique at all times of the year."
42855,Daplumma,2007-03-04 03:00:00,1961,"You got to be kidding me.I am a part timer fishing in the Great White North and prolly 85% of my casting is with a Husky Jerk or a x-rap and I can say that they will produce!As has been mentioned here its all in the confidence in the lure.A white spinnerbait would be a second choice but it is always a decent choice.Next time you get into a good bite,switch up lures to see what else will work,it might surprise you. Joe"
42876,HUKDONFAWNIX,2007-03-04 04:31:00,135,I appreciate all the help guys!  Hopefully I can turn your expertise into results.  
42963,setomonkey,2007-03-04 15:21:00,872,"Good advice about forcing yourself to stick with a lure. One of the things I've found is that I'll rely on the lures I have the most confidence in, esp. on a new lake, so I don't put in the time to get used to a new lure.  Head out one day with just some crankbaits, no spinnerbaits or spoons, and keep at it. I'm sure you'll hook up.  mike"
43059,fishinfool,2007-03-04 23:05:00,366,"Hello there HUKDONFAWNIX I have the same problem with my Baitcaster, I bought a nearly new Shimano Chronarch from E-Bay two years ago and I take it out with me whenever I go fishing. The problem is I try using it for about 20 minutes then I go right back to my Spincasting outfit. Someone also told me to leave the spincaster at the cottage and take only the Baitcaster, I tried it once and came back to get the other rod after only half an hour. lol I have a lot of luck with Rapalas of all types. I have caught Walleye, Bass, even Muskie on them and use them regularly wherever I fish. Keep trying and you will soon find that they are an important part of your arsenal. And if you think that Pickeral are tasty, you should try targetting Crappie in the spring, they are even more delicious believe it or not.  Good Luck and Congratulations on the new addition.  SS"
43069,Victor,2007-03-04 23:32:00,1609,"yeah i remember seeing you alot on the old board ... don't worry, i've only caught one pike on a jerkbait too, great topic!"
43210,Ben_Daniels,2007-03-05 04:03:00,435,Im the Jerk on the other end. Never had much confidence in stick baits.
