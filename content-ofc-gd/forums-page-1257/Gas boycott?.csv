What message? this sounds like a good idea though, what yall think..."

43874,Clampet,2007-03-06 19:01:00,1947,"Boycott one crack,..er gas dealer at a time. Not a pennie spent at the targeted Gas Bar till they are crippled. Problem is to get everyone to cooperate."
43900,Zib,2007-03-06 19:42:00,369,"Boycotting gas stations is always great idea that fizzles fast. Not enough cooperation from other people that ""didn't get the memo"".  People need to conserve & demand alternative fuels else things will never change."

43924,Deano,2007-03-06 20:33:00,767,"First off, Canada is only 5% of big American vehicles sales, then divide the amount of people who will actually do it and you'll be lucky to be in the .1% bracket. Also 1 transatlantic flight will use as much fuel as you'll, (1 individual) will use in 80 years. So personal vehicle usage of fuel is barely a drop in the bucket of the fuel that used. The only thing a boycott will do is help the fuel companies catch up on the demand."
43968,charlied,2007-03-06 22:05:00,584,and probably most that boycott a certain day will all buy gas a day or 2 before that and give the gas company extra profits that day...so in theory it may all just cancel out and the big companies laugh at this! 2cents!
