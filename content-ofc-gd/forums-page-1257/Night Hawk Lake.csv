The only time i have been there is in the fall for moose hunting. I am looking for info on the lake such as ice conditions, access points and general locations to fish as it is a big lake. Any guys fish this lake? Your help would be much appreciated."

But like walleyejigger post,he is right.  There probly is about 3 to 4 ft of ice.I tried  in front of my house on the river on sunday, and there was a good foot of ice.So, the lake should have PLENTY  Anyway, good luck and hope you catch your limit"
