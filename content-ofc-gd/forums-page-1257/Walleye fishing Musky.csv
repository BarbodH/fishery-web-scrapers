43927,GbayGiant,2007-03-06 20:43:00,1780,"I'm sure it's shown up, maybe the guy who caught it posted it somewhwere, but the origional picture is up on the wall next door in the bait shop.  Nice little stories guys, I guess I'm not the only one on to this phenomenon Here's a little walleye that hit a lure more than half his size while I was trolling over 3mph and near the surface to.lol.  "
43473,GbayGiant,2007-03-05 21:15:00,1780,"I was talking to my neighbor that owns a lodge/guide service and the local bait shop and he had this pic. The fish was caught walleye fishing here on the bay, he says it's the biggest fish hes seen in the 40+ years hes fished and operated on the bay. I wish there were some more pics to see the whole fish, but it was a accidental catch and released quickly, I don't want to speculate on the size but will be looking for the little girl this year.     Is it just me or do Walleye fisherman catch the biggest musky ?"
43476,lew,2007-03-05 21:20:00,12767,"Whatever the size, that thing sure looks like a brute !!  Thanks GBay"
43484,ryanheritage,2007-03-05 21:38:00,180,What lake is that from? cause I ain't  swimming in it............lol
43505,kennyman,2007-03-05 22:29:00,737,Holy crap. That's a fish of a lifetime. I guess I better start fishing for walleye. I guess that muskie was in fishing for walleye himself  .
43517,Rich Clemens,2007-03-05 22:44:00,3131,Dang !!!   I gotta learn how to fish for walleye.  My musky fishin' stinks.
43530,Bly,2007-03-05 23:03:00,1556,  PLEASE please please tell me this statement is true!!     lol  bly
43538,GbayGiant,2007-03-05 23:14:00,1780,"Bly don't be surprised if you pull one in on that little shore spot you have one day.  My first 2 muskies ever were both caught on worm-harnesses fishing walleye, that's what got me started.  And the Canadian record (the real world record IMO) caught by Ken O'brian was caught walleye trolling with a little rapala.  "
43541,Rizzo,2007-03-05 23:20:00,4754,yipes what a pig
43562,bucktail,2007-03-05 23:41:00,1857,That thing is awesome! Has to be mid to upper fifties if not pushing the elusive 60lb mark. Probably was if she was full of spawn at that time. Looks like a French river fish from the markings.
43572,GbayGiant,2007-03-05 23:51:00,1780,"Not quite the French, right in front of my sisters 40 min south of the french in the Bay.  Don't pm me for the spot...."
43586,Raf,2007-03-06 00:11:00,3495,"yes, walleye fisherman catch the biggest skis.  what a brute!!  i am not sure if this is the same fish or not, but there was another biggun caught in the same area a couple of years ago in the spring.  i think it was posted on andy's site."
43590,tinbanger,2007-03-06 00:19:00,1028,What a brute !  Thats enough to keep me trying to catch a ski in GBay!  Just gotta break out the walleye gear I guess  TB
43593,GbayGiant,2007-03-06 00:26:00,1780,"I've herd many stories of huge muskies in the spring and fall, if you go to local tackle shops along Hwy #69 they have some pictures of fish you never see on the net that are just huge like this one but they are caught by guys that don't really musky fish and have no need to weigh or measure the fish but I bet they start musky fishing after a nice ski...lol.  It just makes me wonder how big they get in the bay, I don't think 70lbs + is out of the question, there's so much water that probably hasn't even been fished and the musky fishing pressure is low but it's getting more popular every year so I think something huge will turn up soon."
43663,dews,2007-03-06 02:52:00,15,raf .... i thought i recognized this pic from there as well .  The O'brien fish ....I have been on that dock B4 !!
43669,mattyk,2007-03-06 03:14:00,2110,"my first ever muskie was caught while i was fishing for perch/walleye. It was caught on a ultralight with 6lb line and a 2"" jig and minnow."
43671,ccmtcanada,2007-03-06 03:19:00,7971,I'd love to hook into a nice sized ski!  Maybe this year...ahh....warm weather....cant wait to get out there now!!!
43675,Cast-Away,2007-03-06 03:41:00,790,"If you want to see huge GBay Ski's, visit Cookstown Autowreckers. The owner Johnny and his son have some monsters in there that were all caught in the basin.  If memory serves me, there is a 54 lb Ski, another around 50, a Pike in the high 30's and some monster Bass and Walleye. The 54 pounder was caught by his son at the age of 12 in late November!"
43678,Cookslav,2007-03-06 03:46:00,1457,"2 years ago My Pops hooked a MONSTER musky in G-bay...fishing for Pickeral But My dad had no chance of landing it...6lb test, on a 2"" Rapala Classic story LOL He thought he snagged the bottom... Then it did a wicked head shake and jumped...errr...""Flopped"" twice right close to the boat, and then Luckily the beast spit him out, rather then snap him off. But I swear on all that is holy... That fish would have been ""close enough"" to contimplate a run to the post office..."
43712,OhioFisherman,2007-03-06 09:17:00,6623,"John I have seen that picture before on a web site but can`t remember which one. GB has some big skis, maybe not the numbers of some other waters, but some hawgs swimming there.  Seems like every year here somebody fishing for walleye catches a good one here on one of the inland lakes. A numbers thing, more people fishing for walleye than skis, and skis seem to eat everything."
43736,Clampet,2007-03-06 12:39:00,1947,Imagine the surprise of hooking a bruiser when pursuing smaller fish!
43757,Guest mistyriver1,2007-03-06 13:06:00,0,"WOW, huge fish, every musky fisherman's dream.....Thanks for posting GBay."
43759,JerseyDog,2007-03-06 13:19:00,190,"Nice fish.  Muskie are one of the reasons I went barbless. I fish with lighter tackle for pike, walleye and bass and at least one muskie has snapped off my tackle and I worried endlessly she would never be able to spit the hooks so I figured I'd at least give the next one a fighting change."
43783,kennyman,2007-03-06 14:41:00,737,"Maybe on one of those bucktails in your signature. Let's see..... hmmm....... you could call it the ""GbayGiant""!"
43792,Headhunter,2007-03-06 15:24:00,5703,"It's funny but, pickeral fisherman catch the biggest Musky and Musky guys catch the biggest Pickeral! How many musky guys trolling around looking for that elusive trophy, end up catching a double digit Pickeral or even a huge Bass? It happens all the time! HH"
43801,ehg,2007-03-06 16:06:00,2666,I've caught my 3 or 4 largest muskies on 3 inch jig/grub combo while walleye fishing. Had even bigger muskies i couldn't bring in while fishing for pickerel. Some of my largest bass have hit musky bucktails.  This is one of my largest Kawartha walleyes which was caught trolling big jointed musky lure.   ehg
