Only problem, my wife and I have ‘some’ time on our hands, but very little cash.   We want to head to North Bay or Temagami, to spend a night or two, and do some fishing.   I guess I’m looking for some suggestions as far as where to fish (walking or driving out), and where to stay (for about $50 a night). Sounds tight and it is. [Need work on our well system, and gas tank & fuel pump in the truck] We have made this kind of trip happen before.  Total budget, is $200 for gas, food, and lodging.   If you live in North Bay or Temagami area, I’d appreciate any ideas, suggestions, phone numbers, names of motels, etc.   Entropy"

As far as places to stay, there is lots in North bay, some in Callandar.  Just start calling to find the best rate.  Terrace suites in Callander is a great place to take the wife, but it is likely out of your budget.  Tony"
