43973,tomO,2007-03-06 22:13:00,363,"I just bought one used for $55.00 U S , seems to work well I just threw a 2 ounce sinker about 40 yrds or so across the yard creek and into the woods. I got snagged in a tree and had to cut the line.I put some old 30 lb test mono on it just to try it. Should I fill it with power pro? any ideas guys? Oh I mounted it on a berkley big cat pole, Thought I'd use it for cats and maybe trolling musky."
43977,OhioFisherman,2007-03-06 22:22:00,6623,A good heavy duty reel suitable for the purposes stated.
43978,Roy,2007-03-06 22:26:00,13728,It's a good tough reel. Not much can go wrong with it. It'll cast a mile. Is it the red one or?
43979,tomO,2007-03-06 22:31:00,363,Yea it's red Roy not sure how old it is.
43984,Pigeontroller,2007-03-06 22:41:00,2793,"Widely considered to be ""the"" Muskie reel. If its the 4:1 gear ratio it will make an excellent trolling reel, but will still retrieve at a good rate due to the large spool diametre. If its a 5:1 gear ratio it will burn Bucktails like no other reel. Downside, its dern big and heavy for all day casting sessions!"
43985,camillj,2007-03-06 22:45:00,1988,I won  one in the 'Great Star Salmon Hunt' about 25 yrs ago ... still going strong ...
43988,GbayGiant,2007-03-06 22:46:00,1780,"It's my favorite musky reel, for trolling, casting big heavy lures, and the line clicker is a must if you quick-strike rig with suckers.  Awesome reel."
43991,tomO,2007-03-06 22:55:00,363,"I was hoping for good reviews, It's heavy duty for sure."
44001,lew,2007-03-06 23:17:00,12767,"I use the Abu Big Game 7000 (gold) which is a similar set-up, and yes, their an excellent reel.  My main purpose for it is  for jerk baits, and with the large spool, it takes up slack very fast, with little effort.  You'll be more than happy with it."
44125,muskymatt,2007-03-07 03:25:00,2608,"Awesome reel , multi purpose.....won't let you down."
