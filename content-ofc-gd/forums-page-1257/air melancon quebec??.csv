43856,solopaddler,2007-03-06 18:19:00,8605,"Which camp are you going to? The one on the island or the one on the beach? I came super close to booking the beach cabin for my wife and myself a few years ago, but didn't. It's been on my list of spots to go to for awhile now.... Wish I could help you out, but from my end I'd love to hear how you make out on your trip! The only thing I can tell you, I investigated Air Melancon thoroughly and they seem to be a very highly regarded outfitter. I think you made a good choice"
43887,jnic,2007-03-06 19:20:00,158,wanted to stay on the island but they really reccomended the beach cabin. the showers will be nice. i will post a review and let you know. thanks jnic
43963,aplumma,2007-03-06 21:59:00,6896,Anything with the last name of Melancon is OK in my book.   Art Melancon ( Cajun from the great state of Louisiana)  P.S. I have no REAL input on the airline I just read it quickly and saw my name  aRt melancon
43972,Daplumma,2007-03-06 22:13:00,1961,How could you go wrong with a fine name like that. Joe
43980,Roy,2007-03-06 22:34:00,13728,"But being a Cajun...the name ain't right without the cedilla...as in ""Melan√ßon"". I've never used their services but they are very well known here and I've never heard bad news about them. Have a great trip."
44028,aplumma,2007-03-07 00:02:00,6896,You are correct Roy the cedilla at one time was in the name. Over time though we kept leaving the cedilla in our  pants pockets and finally it got washed in the laundry.  Art
44029,Mike the Pike,2007-03-07 00:07:00,3421,Bob Izumi has been in some of their ads in the Quebec fishing magazines.Like Roy said this place has a very high reputation.Get ready to$$$$$$$$$$$$$.MTP
