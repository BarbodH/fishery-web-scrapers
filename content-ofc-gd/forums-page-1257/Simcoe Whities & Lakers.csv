Day started out with a brilliant green-red meteorite falling from the sky as we waited for kids in school parking lot at 5:30 am. Started up to Simcoe with 3 vehicles.... look in my review and no one is with me. Vehicle had to stop since one of the kids is sick. Great!! We journey on up 23 and get to the lake at 7:00..... out to the huts by 7:30. Sick kid catches the first fish , a nice 5 lb whitefish and then retreats to corner of hut. Marked fish all morning... landed another whitefish and a laker by noon. Call to shore and sick kid gets Gramps to take him home! Caught a beauty 10 lb laker and two more whities before venturing home. As soon as I figure out how to post pics I'll add them! Heading to Haliburton on Sunday...... anybody ever fish Boshkung? Know where to get minnows? Keep your eye on your tip-up!"
