43628,TennesseeGuy,2007-03-06 01:45:00,957,Sorry.  It worked in the preview.  Somebody might tell me what I did wrong.  It's supposed to be a movie without sound.
43629,Greencoachdog,2007-03-06 01:52:00,8163,"I'm not sure what you did wrong with the vid TG, but I am sure Ernie Eagle is a heckuva fisherman... his life depends on it!"
43633,TennesseeGuy,2007-03-06 02:06:00,957,"Sometimes the preview is better than the show.  Will keep trying and come back when activity is slow.  Take my word for it, Ernie can catch fish."
