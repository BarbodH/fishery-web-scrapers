43847,Slayingm,2007-03-06 17:58:00,204,As typical in late season the perch are most scattered and often in smaller schools but the action can still be great if your willing to move around a bit and try different things.... the past couple of weeks I have taken folks out on perch trips between trout and whities and done well 3-5 KM out from beaverton working in the 28 to 35ft depths. Super light lines (2lb) are key this time of year as the fish are really finicky. Small shinners on Gold hooks and spikes (maggots) on micro jigs and small jigging raps have accounted for great catches. Remember to be flexible and keep moving around on the flats... the fish are there big time... here are a couple of pics from trips the past few days....   http://profishntanglingservices.com/MyPict.../100_0005-5.jpg http://profishntanglingservices.com/MyPict.../100_0028-5.jpg http://profishntanglingservices.com/MyPict.../100_0009-5.jpg  Be careful and safe out there..... lots of slush in some area's!   Best of luck and good fish'n.... Greg.

43858,Clampet,2007-03-06 18:24:00,1947,Do U think 10 lb Fluorocarbon is OK?
43865,Josh Rogers,2007-03-06 18:45:00,79,"The man said light line 2 lb test. I would go with what he said. I was out at beaverton and using 4 lb test and the other guys that were with me were using 6 and 10 and I caught fish at a rate of at least 2 to 1 on both of them put together. Plus when a guy has as many posts on here with good catches as Greg does I wouldn't question what he's saying. That's why he gets paid to take people fishing, cause he knows what he's talking about.

43944,Clampet,2007-03-06 21:18:00,1947," Did I say Flurocarbon? Might be a diff between Monofilament and Flurocarbon, do ya think?"
43951,Terry,2007-03-06 21:37:00,14456,"I would think he posts the link instead of the pictures so people have a choice as to whether or not they want to view them all, helping the people on dailup"
43952,tonyb,2007-03-06 21:40:00,1637,"People are still on dial-up?  Good point, I'll leave it next time.  Tony"
43957,irishfield,2007-03-06 21:52:00,26272,Hey..quit larfing at me buddy!  Great stuff Greg...I'd break 2 lb on the hook set...LOL
43964,Terry,2007-03-06 22:00:00,14456,"but on the other hand  it might be he posts the same thing on so many boards that he just does a cut and paste, with links so all boards can handle the same pasted stuff"
