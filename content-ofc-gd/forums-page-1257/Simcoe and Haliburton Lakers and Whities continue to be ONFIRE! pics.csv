I'm able to get out into the middle of the lake and cross all the slush beds with no problem at all.... even with 6 guys in the vehicle! Fishing continues to be awesome out there with 18 Lakers and lots and whities caught the past 3 days. Modified jigging Raps, Meegs and William's spoons along with minnow set lines have accounted for the fish. I'm fishing areas' with no one within 2km and the fish are not pressured and responding well. Moving around a bit seems to the be the key at times. Look for hard to soft bottom transistions and fish them hard.... they are fish highways!!!.... we have had double headers on both Lakers and whitefish a number of times by fishing hard and paying attention to details.   Here are some pics from action with clients the past few days....        Be careful out there and be safe!!...Good Fish'n .. Greg."
