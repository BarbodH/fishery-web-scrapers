43199,kennyman,2007-03-05 03:36:00,737,Let's try that pic again. Sorry guys.Also to give you an idea of the size of the baits the smaller ones are approx. six inches and the bigger one is twelve inches. Thanks. 
43200,Fishmaster,2007-03-05 03:39:00,920,Look like Jake patrens
43223,GbayGiant,2007-03-05 05:01:00,1780,"Top one Grandman/Jake two below it look like Cobbs gliders, fire perch one is a suick, bucktail, the other two not sure."
43263,crusty,2007-03-05 12:45:00,83,Looks like a great set to start your collection. That bucktail should work on the kawarthas. Have a ton of fun!
43301,kennyman,2007-03-05 14:20:00,737,Here's a look at the whole buctail Crusty (I cut it off in the pic last time) and a measuring tape for scale. Also a litle better pic I hope (daytime). 
43303,crusty,2007-03-05 14:24:00,83,"They all look awsome! They will all produce for you. Somewhere, sometime. You will owe the seller a beer for every musky you bag this season. Top water in low light. Bucktails through the weeds. Persistance will pay."
43307,kennyman,2007-03-05 14:33:00,737,Just got a reply from vanillagorilla (seller) and he confirms GbayGiants Cobb Gliders and apparently the bucktail is called a Spinda Spinner. I guess that only leaves the topwater with the prop on the rear unidentified.
43545,brickNblock,2007-03-05 23:23:00,598,"Kennyman.. I could be mistaken but, That bucktail looks an awful lot like a Weight-Forward bucktail which is the opposite of what is generally available in tackle shops.(most are weighted in the end close to the treb.)       The W-F, B-T drops faster and drops blade first......it's far better for 'ripping' through heavy weeds, resulting in less salad on your lure. After a few wobbly pops one night I messed up and made one similar..just the same I tried it and it is a completely different action altogether.......Loved it....I now have propably 1/2 dozen of these little babies. There is a guy who has been making this style for a while now.......but you dont see to many about just yet. Try that baby when your casting/throwing heavy cover........it's far superior then the norm."
43548,GbayGiant,2007-03-05 23:27:00,1780,"I hear ya Brick, I made a couple myself they are better weighted like that sometimes, or I made some that are evenly weighted down the whole shaft that work better for trolling them."
