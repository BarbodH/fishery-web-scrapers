So take a minutes and post a picture of your noteworthy PB's and less see all those beautiful fish!  This Brookie was caught this winter and measured in at a solid 23.5"" no scale, so I didn't get a weight, but any guesses?    This Largie was caught a little north of Kingston, not weight, no measurement, but by far my PB.    This eye came in at 29"" if I remember correctly, caught on opening day last year.    Lets see what you've got!"

It's not every day that i get to catch a Gar Pike but this little guy was a extraordinary surprise to me as i was using a little 1/4oz blue fox while fishing for SMB and rock bass when this fish hit. I saw them in the area weeks before but some never left. Would love to catch another Gar one day.
