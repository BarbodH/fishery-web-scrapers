336930,singingdog,2009-05-01 10:29:00,1047,Shorten it: cut some off Lengthen it: tie a longer one on.  (this applies to shortening or lengthening almost anything   )
336931,Paully,2009-05-01 10:32:00,712,I usually use my trusty line stretcher...
336964,Garry2Rs,2009-05-01 12:29:00,1425,"Now that the humorists have finished with you, you might want to try this... Salt water guy change leaders using a loop-to-loop system. Using a Spider hitch or other non-slip loop knot on the ends of the main line and the leader will allow you to interlock the two loops but still be able to undo the link to change leaders.  This might be useful when Carolina rigging etc. If you're not familiar with a good loop knot Google ""Spider Hitch"" and you will find links to How-To diagrams"
336969,Bly,2009-05-01 12:45:00,1556,"Igor,  Not a silly question but if you could offer a little more info it might help.    Like what kind of leader and what you are using it to fish for.   Garry....your signature.......LOL!!!"
337056,bassjnkie,2009-05-01 16:47:00,1101,"For match/float fishing I tie up my leaders in advance, with a loop at the end. This way I put the loop through the swivel, and the hook through the loop and pull tight. That way I can change my presentation quickly."
337201,mdej,2009-05-02 01:14:00,98,  I usually tie mine at home as well.  But never thought of the loop concept.  I'm gonna give that a try.
337238,Nanook,2009-05-02 02:31:00,565,I was using the 'Loop system 50 yrs ago in the UK.  You Guy's are only just catching up ?????????????
337239,Twocoda,2009-05-02 02:36:00,4130,my line stretcher consists of a heavy rainbow in deep fast water.....but i recommend not using mine cuz it always seems to make my line shorter than longer...  loop loop loop
