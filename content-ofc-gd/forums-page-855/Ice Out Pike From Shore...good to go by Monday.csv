Its pretty good though now, although its been pretty cold here the last week....was snowing last 3 days....wind and temps are due to be up these nextfew days and that means i reckon i'll have enough water to shore fish for some big pike by monday.    ITS GOING!!!!!                      I've still got work to do getting the boat ready, parts ordered etc...etc...so its kinda good the ice is there....otherwise the temptation to set sail before i was shipshape would be too great.  I'm even preping the wee lad for his maiden voyage....got him a mini PFD yesterday, lol....he was not too sure at first...but he had a goofy grin on his face by the end of the fitting      BORN TO FISH!             "
337199,smokin joe,2009-05-02 01:09:00,226,Glad to see your starting to get some soft water Simon.  And WTG on the PFD those pics are great  You should have enough time before ice out to rig up a car seat in the boat
337202,limeyangler,2009-05-02 01:19:00,5204,  Lol....i'm already on it....just need to istall my new trolling motor before i do though...so its not banging on poor bubas head up the front deck....lol.
337203,Leecher,2009-05-02 01:19:00,7832,That is real good news Simon The ice looks thin now with being real dark on top and won't be long until you'll be able to sail on soft water!!!  I know that you've been itching for some time now and can't wait to see your first report this soft water season.  Keep us posted of the ice condition Jacques
