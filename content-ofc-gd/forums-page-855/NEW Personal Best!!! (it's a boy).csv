337049,The Urban Fisherman,2009-05-01 16:33:00,2050,"Thanks again guys!  I wish I could get back to each of you for your awesome replies but I forgot about the sleepless nights, constant attention needed, suddenly high maintenance big sister, and recovering mommy.  Right now the whole crew is taking a nap while I enjoy some quite time around the house.  Supposed to set up the trampoline for Averie this afternoon as long as the weather holds out.  Thanks again - and good luck out on the water.  I know I can't wait to get out again!  Cheers, Ryan"
337084,Spiel,2009-05-01 17:52:00,9065,Look after yourself too Ryan or you'll be no good to anyone. We'll still be here when you find time.

337108,ohhenrygsr,2009-05-01 18:43:00,947,Hey Congrats on the lil monster.  Where are you located? in the barrie area?
336737,The Urban Fisherman,2009-04-30 19:35:00,2050,"What a BRUTE!  My wife Ginny was 90lbs soaking wet before she got pregnant with our second child, and painfully gave birth to an 8lb 1 ouncer on Monday April 27th @ 2:58 p.m.  Our daughter was only 5lbs so this was quite the feat.  It went so fast they couldn't give her any hard-core drugs, and  she took it like a champ!  Introducing future fishing freak, Luke Douglas Gaston Bonin.            Sorry about all the pics, but we decided he was a keeper so it wouldn't hurt to take so many!    I can't wait to get him out on the water with his big sister!  In a completely unrelated, but fishing related topic, a few weeks back I took the boat out for a few hours on Long Point Bay.  I was cruising along at around 20mph in very familiar water when I struck a sunken ice hut that some jack -  decided to let sink through the ice this spring.  My wife's cousin is a commercial fisherman in the area and has pulled out 3 himself.  Anyways, the incident left me with some minor but annoying damage on the prop.  I checked the gear oil in the foot of my motor and it was a-ok, no signs of water getting in, but I'm not sure what to do about the prop?  Can I just take a file to it, or do I have to purchase a new one and use this as a spare?  I had a couple of tiny dings that were already there, but these ones are a little deeper.      Any advice would be appreciated.  I already talked to some of the boys on here and they suggested bringing it to a shop out by Whitby, but I'm open for suggestions.  Could these dings cause any other issues for my motor in the future (vibrations etc.) or am I ok to let it go for a little while?  Thanks - and have a good one.  Ryan"
336738,frozen-fire,2009-04-30 19:42:00,542,congratulations on the new addition

336741,fishnsled,2009-04-30 19:49:00,3520,"Congrats again Ryan!  A keeper for sure.  As for the prop, I'd fix or replace it.  You can file it down and get it pretty close but it's pretty much impossible to know if it's properly balanced without the proper equipment.  It's now out of balance and over time can cause more serious damage to the motor.  Noticed that Cabelas has props on sale now, might find a good deal.  Probably costs about a $100 to fix.   I had a quote last year to fix mine of $110 and ended up buying a new aftermarket for $130.  So far so good.  Also picked up a spare, just in case.  PS - You might want to do you own repairs on the damaged one and keep it for a spare as the damage isn't too bad.  Pick up a new one as you main prop.  Just a suggestion."
336746,highdrifter,2009-04-30 20:02:00,2534,"That is the sweetest looking PB I've ever seen dude!!  Congrats to you and yours..  Apparently, we both like our ladies ""pettite""!!

336748,GBW,2009-04-30 20:07:00,8460,"I know why you called him Luke!  So you can say ""Luke....I AM your father....""  Congrats and glad to hear everyone is doing well.  The best advice I was ever told about having 2 or more kids is this.  When feeding, holding or doing anything with the baby you are 100% engaged with the other child.  So if you are feeding him, make sure you are talking to your daughter (making eye contact as much as you can) so she is less likely to be jealous.  Good luck! Geoff"
336761,Dara,2009-04-30 20:34:00,3052,"Nice catch..Can you get the number off the hut? If we gotta register em, we may as well get compensated when they cause trouble."

Then at 8pm I turn into a bottle/clothes/floor/_______ cleaner.  Around 9:30 I get the pre-bed feeding. Now folding laundry and having a cocktail.  Getting ready for tomorow.  Even when they're bad they're good!"

I'd buy a new one anyways (assuming you don't already have a spare) and keep the rebuilt prop as a spare.  I don't know where to get it done in your area, but if your ever in this neck of the woods, The Prop Drop does a good job on mine.  Sinker"
