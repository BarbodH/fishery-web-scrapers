PS I am also looking for a good outboard mechanic who is honest and quick to service my 1999 mercury motor  My location is in the GTA and work a lot, so I cant really travel to far..........  thank you very much"

337191,Twocoda,2009-05-02 00:36:00,4130,"there is a buffing compound called ""finnesse it"" made by 3m....you dont have to use thier pads but i recommend you do ...you wont be disappointed....  it is milder then wet sanding ..."
