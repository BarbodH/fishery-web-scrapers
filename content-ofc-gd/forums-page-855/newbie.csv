Muskie, salmon, whities, walleye and smallies. My squeeze is a 17 ft Lund Tyee/115 Yami 4 str. I'm out there twice weekly May -Oct.  I need some advice. Looking to rent a cottage on the St Lawrence just west of Brockville end of July.  Anybody have any comments on the fishing there?"

One place I can recommend is Caiger's Resort.  It's on the 1000 Island Parkway right on the river.  Has docking and a boat ramp.  There breakfast (at least the one I had) is very filling.  It puts you right in the heart of good smallie, largie, pike and musky.  Your boat will handle most of the river conditions very well."
