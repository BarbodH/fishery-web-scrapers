The river is unsafe to fish and there is zero visability.  The new date is May 9th, same time, same place.  As my original message states, if the river is in flood stage, it will take place the following week.  If you have any questions, please email me at [emailÂ protected].  Justin"

Some have replied stating you cannot make it, and some of you have said that you can.  What I need everyone to do is email me, indicating if they will be able to show up so I can ammend the teams properly.  Secondly, for those that cannot, I need to know if you would like to donate your entry fee to CRAA and remain in the draw for the prizes.  Those that cannot come, and donate money to the club are more than welcome to join us for lunch.  Please get back to me as soon as possible so that I can make necessary changes for the event and have it run as smoothly as possible for next Saturday.  Thank you and I apologise for the inconvenience."
