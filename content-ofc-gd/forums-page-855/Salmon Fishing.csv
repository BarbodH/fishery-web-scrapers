336200,live2fish,2009-04-29 02:36:00,70,Fishing is getting really hot. This past weekend was nuts with lotsa numbers and good size. Looking to be a very good year with the fish already fat!  Heres some of the bigger ones from sunday and a 20.96 lb laker.        Bowen
336202,Twocoda,2009-04-29 02:46:00,4130,i havent seen this years fish consumption guide....do you guys eat them out of Lake O ? .....Looks like a good days haul....nice shooting ....havent seen a cooler look that good out of Lake H since 2002  Thats what i love about Lake O though ....big azz fish are alot of fun ...  How deep were you running over what depth ...   Im now motivated to get the boat ready for the spring derby...
336203,drwxr,2009-04-29 02:46:00,453,won't be good in fall if every ship is gonna do same thing
336205,live2fish,2009-04-29 02:51:00,70,spring fish are awesome to eat.....nice on the cedar plank or smoked......better to keep them now then in the summer or fall they taste much better. also we were in a torunament so we didnt keep them for the sake of keeping them.
336207,Twocoda,2009-04-29 03:00:00,4130,so what was the average size of the catch ...( just the salmon).....that is one big boot though ...we get brown that big and bigger but not lakers
336211,cram,2009-04-29 03:09:00,1733,That's a lot of fish......can you eat those? I always thought the lake ontario salmon were toxic.
336252,T.Barry,2009-04-29 09:00:00,24,He was fishing the Scotty King of the Lake Tourney on the weekend that is why he kept so many (before anyone else questions why he kept them)!
336253,Fudd,2009-04-29 09:05:00,94,Some nice fish there mate.. how did you go in the tourney?
336254,brifishrgy,2009-04-29 09:24:00,559,  more fish taken now = more food for fish that are left = bigger shoe leather swimmin up the streams to give that pin a workout
336280,smokin joe,2009-04-29 12:02:00,226,Nice job man how'd you guys do in the Scotty?  Funny I missed your invite call

337226,wallacio,2009-05-02 02:15:00,475," Sorry - I didn't notice that those results were from last year.  For what it's worth, here's a photo borrowed from ""Spoonpullers""...not sure if it's the final standings though.  http://i2.photobucket.com/albums/y40/nflboy07/top.jpg"
