336626,Guest gbfisher,2009-04-30 13:07:00,0,why?
336636,tinbanger,2009-04-30 13:38:00,1028,don't know   TB
336639,GBW,2009-04-30 13:49:00,8460,probably a new sponsor for them.
336659,Meely,2009-04-30 15:05:00,282,If I did manage to find the free time...... I'd rather spend it pushing 5 odds into my eye !!!  Meely
336662,lookinforwalleye,2009-04-30 15:19:00,4399,"Met and spoke to Ron and Leo many times,they are good guys!"
336667,Guest gbfisher,2009-04-30 15:52:00,0,sure they are....when they want something....
336814,misfish,2009-04-30 23:18:00,29133,"Oh, come on guys,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,be nice. Saddly I have to work that day."
336944,bigugli,2009-05-01 11:25:00,6138,Sadly I have watched in total amazement as Ron James completely ignored a group of kids at the Fishing Show one year.
336961,cityfisher,2009-05-01 12:23:00,959,ron was on scugog over the weekend....did i care to meet him??? not at all... not a fan of their show
336966,lew,2009-05-01 12:41:00,12766,I actually kinda like the show for the fact that it's not all flash & spam like so many of the other fishing shows that are on to tube these days.  Always seems to me to be sorta slow paced & easy going and more like a normal fishing trip than an infomercial.
337033,Stoty,2009-05-01 15:51:00,2910," HA!  I was pretty happy 2 seasons ago, when my buddy and I in a 16ft aluminum with a 30, WHOOOPED them in a bass tournament on Rice Lake, while they were in their big fancy 21ft, with a 225."
337036,4thgen,2009-05-01 16:03:00,157,"I always liked Leo and Steve, who I used to play ""trophy hunter"" with after the Sportsman's show was closed for the day.  Leo and Ron though.. I don't watch. I don't like the way they hold fish that they plan to release. I mean release them before you do your segment, don't just hold them in the background for a minute while you talk. The Boga grip thing is also stupid. They might be a sponser but I love the episode with the big silver pike where they try to get it with the Boga for like 30 seconds before the Boga gets tangled in the line, almost breaks it and they just grab the pike properly by the gill cover in all of two seconds..."
337037,BUSTER,2009-05-01 16:03:00,1336,"I enjoy the show, and I have talked with them both, great guys.. you wonder why sometimes they ignore some people. lighten up.. I like the laid back go fishing attitude and joke around in the boat kind of show.."
337173,Viscount,2009-05-01 23:12:00,52,"Buddy, their show isn't at the top of my list but its certainly not at the bottom. Know what I mean, Buddy? I like their laid back approach too, Buddy.   I would have gone if I lived in the area Bud. Not sure how long I could stand talking to them though!  K (Buddy)"
337176,Rizzo,2009-05-01 23:25:00,4754,"When they started using the boga grip I stopped watching (that was years ago, not sure if they still use that silly thing). It was so obvious they were only doing it because of the sponsorship dollars."
337195,dada2727,2009-05-02 01:00:00,108,"I ran into Ron a few years ago at a gas station.  I told him I liked his show and he kinda just brushed me off like he was some sort of celebrity!  haha, still laugh at that."
337210,Guest gbfisher,2009-05-02 01:27:00,0,Its funny how they can make a show when they personally haven't caught any fish and show fish being caught. Its even more hilarious to see everyone of them catching fish on the same fishing rod??!!. Now how would ya figure that could happen..  . Community fishing rod I guess..... They still don't know how to catch whitefish!....   and they're easier than Bass..   
337267,BUSTER,2009-05-02 11:27:00,1336,  whats funny is how your trying hard to turn an announcement into bash the fishtv guys thread
337271,Spiel,2009-05-02 12:12:00,9065,Time out...........
