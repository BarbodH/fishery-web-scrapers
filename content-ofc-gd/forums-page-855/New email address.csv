336623,JohnF,2009-04-30 13:06:00,3494," As Mo has said, simply sign up for Gmail. I've been using it for years and it's great. It's a Google product and has lots of useful tools available. I have built my own mail groups with it. It allows large file transfers. The spam filters are good. About the only thing it stops is exe file transfers. The best part about it is that it is available to you on any computer as long as you know your own pw.  A friend of mine steered me to it when it was relatively new and I've been happy with it ever since. If you need a link to it pm me and I'll send the connection. It's free and very dependable.  JF"

336728,Marko,2009-04-30 18:53:00,854,Either Gmail or Hotmail. They both work alright and are free

I send out mass newsletters for companies often and I find Hotmail's servers are by far the slowest at receiving the mail from my bazillion tests.  Sometimes even a day behind when sending mass emails, I don't understand why but quite frankly don't care either lol."
