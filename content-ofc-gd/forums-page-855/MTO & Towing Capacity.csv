336448,Nippissinger,2009-04-29 21:51:00,53,"So, basically if the loaded trailer weighs more than 2800kg's, then you include that weight in the GVWR of the truck. meaning the truck's GVWR must exeed the total weight of both truck, trailer and load.  If the loaded trailer weighs less than 2800kg's, then just the tongue weight of the loaded trailer is included in the towing vehicles GVWR.  If the loaded trailer weighs more than 3000kg's then the trailer MUST be equipped with a braking system.  Safety chains should have a spring loaded closing metal clasp. Not required on light duty trailers, but impresses the MTO and shows conscious concern of safety which keeps the hounds at bay.  Annual Inspections are geared to Commercial Vehicles or where the towing or towed vehicle's GVWR exeeds 4500kg's, or any combination of vehicles exeed 4500kg.  Ontario Annual Inspection Regulations  Also, make sure ALL lights on both vehicles work if installed.  The more respect you show for safety on the road the better your chances of hassle free towing...  Good Luck and Happy Trailering....  Will"
336449,Terry,2009-04-29 22:07:00,14456,"OK I finally read this thread and now I wish I did not  so if I get an under sized trailer I am good but if I buy a good sturdy trailer I could be fined...what the heck I think the regs said if the trailer has a gross weight sticker you go by that, wouldn't you just rip the sticker off if it's too high.  and when I made my last trailer , they asked me how much I wanted it rated for when I was getting an ownership  guess I need the right hooks too, how did the marina sell me the boat and trailer without having the right type of hooks"
336453,Nippissinger,2009-04-29 22:41:00,53,"The ""S"" hooks are legal just not the BEST....  Most tandem light duty trailers are around 3500kg GVWR and usually not more than 4500kg as this will put you into a heavy duty class requiring a whole bunch of legislation. The trailers are usually around 300-500kg leaving 3000 - 4000kg for the boat.  I just registered a home built trailer and all they asked for was est. weight of trailer and number of axles.... I guess I got lucky there. I am only towing a 16' aluminum so the trailer probably weights more than the boat....  Just remember that if your combined vehicle weight is over 4500kg in Ontario we are required to enter scales... Although recreational vehicles are still in the gray area as I see many fifth wheels rollin right on by and no cherries...So far....  If unsure it is best to write your Ministry and ask as many questions as you need to get the rules straight. If they ofer the rules in writing, print it and keep it close to the wheel....Don't trust anyone but the MTO as they are the all knowing of the Highway Traffic Act...  So it may be best to slip the big boys and trailer the little skiffs...  Will"
336707,perodimi,2009-04-30 17:38:00,124,"Hi Everybody,  I've been following this thread all along and decided to do some checking myself. I called the MTO and they had to put me through to an enforcement officer and from that I learned the following:  First of all, I have a Chevy Suburban 2500 (3/4 ton) with a 3900kg GVW towing my 20' Legend Sportfish boat. According to this thread, I'm way over the 4500kg limit, I just don't know my boat weight and the stamp on the tongue (3500lbs/1591kg) is not what they go by. He wants actual weight rubber to pavement which he determines himself with pad scales.  According to the same website quoted before:  http://www.mto.gov.on.ca/english/trucks/re...ns/annual.shtml  It states: ""Truck"" includes, but is not limited to: a.truck tractors, straight trucks, pickup trucks, curb side/cube vans, business use trade vans/panel trucks, and b.passenger vans and two and four wheel drive sport utility vehicles while being used to transport cargo, other than personal effects, with one or more of the vehicle's rear seats removed. This applies regardless of how the vehicle is plated, e.g., car, truck or farm plated.  He explained that the SUV's are exempt because of the caviat ""while being used to transport cargo, other than personal effects, with one or more of the vehicle's rear seats removed."" The pickup trucks do not have this caviat so are subject to scrutiny. I guess this precludes hauling a bunch of appliances, furniture and a boat trailer which is less likely in an SUV?  Second, according to this website:  http://www.mto.gov.on.ca/english/trucks/re.../trailers.shtml  He said that the actual trailer weight must exceed the 2800kgs in order for it to be included in the total weight of both the vehicle and trailer.  Bottom Line:  -Know your weights and keep them below 4500kgs for the truck but more importantly, the trailer below 2800kgs. He said that he'll still weigh you but at least you know you're below. -SUV's are not targeted unless the seats are removed and replaced with non personal cargo. -Pick ups are a target if their actual or GVW exceeds 4500kg. A 3/4 ton dually for example comes in at around 5500kgs so it automatically requires the sticker if towing. -Regular single wheel pick ups could be pulled over and weighed for compliance. -Having your rig weighed means nothing to him as that is changeable day to day. It's only a guideline for your benefit.  Clear as mud now? Sorry for the long winded response but I thought it may help everyone out especially the SUV owners. Make sure and inquire about your own setup.  Cheers,  Peter"
336807,FUSION,2009-04-30 23:02:00,81, I agree 100%. I see on a weekly baisis people trailering loads that are way beyond there vehicles capability. If your trailer weight regardless what your towing requires that your vehicle should be a heavy duty vehicle such as a Super Duty or 2500 class truck and your endargering everyone on the road by pulling it with an uncapeble vehicle than good on the MTO for pulling you off the road.  Its not about what can get the trailer moveing but what can safely maintain the load at speed and what is capable of safely stoping the load at hi-way speeds. Just cause your trailer has brakes means nothing if it is overpowering your vehicles brakeing  under stoping.  The truck/suv should always manage/maintain the trailer not vice-versa.

Do you really want to try to tow that 20' Lund with your Honda Civic???  If you have enough money to buy a nice boat boat or travel trailer... you should have enough money to buy a decent tow vehicle first!!!  What's so hard to figure out about that???  Towing on the highway is just like fishing on a lake, you should know all the regulations... ignorance of the law is no excuse!!!"
334577,irishfield,2009-04-25 02:12:00,26272,Read it again Dawg... you can tow it with the civic and be under the GVWR that requires annual inspections of vehicle and trailer. Towing it properly with a FORD truck is when they pull you over to show annual inspection stickers!
334582,skeeter,2009-04-25 02:34:00,1907,but if you tow it with the civic wouldnt you be over the tow rating on the civic??
334584,irishfield,2009-04-25 02:36:00,26272,  For sure... but you wouldn't be in violation of the requirement for annual inspections on both the tow vehicle and the trailer. You'd only be over the max capacity of the civic.. and not sure if there's a fine for that one.. other than the common sense law.
334595,irishfield,2009-04-25 03:11:00,26272,"Too many flaws in what they present and what you get charged with. Here's the best example.

So which is it.. illegal for a guy with a 3000kg truck GVWR... that doesn't exceed that amount on the scale with the added tongue weight of the trailer on... that only weighs 2000 kg?... or is he illegal because his trailer has a 3180KG rating?.. for a total of 6180 KG GVWR??  http://www.mto.gov.on.ca/english/trucks/re.../trailers.shtml"

Complete service and inspection = road worthy in my eyes.. so have at her and throw a conformance sticker on it for me on the way out the door. So Monday my truck got the complete service.... was called and it was ""ready to go but we didn't have a mechanic free to do the conformance.. so we'll do it tomorrow"". No issue.. I had their loaner car!  So what was supposed to be an additional $129.99 for that stupid yellow sticker turned into an extra $708 with tax. What was apparently ""fine for the road"".. seized emerg brake pivots wouldn't pass to get a sticker. So with that work and new rear rotors.. because they were a little of of round ... wth... that sticker got expensive. Now I've got the boat trailer going thru another shop monday morning and we'll see what that little yellow sticker costs me to add to this. Next round... I'll take the fine!... or I'm gonna put a 5 x 6 pup tent in the box of the truck and tell the cop it's my ""motorhome"" and I don't require all the comforts of home !!"

336289,aniceguy,2009-04-29 12:36:00,1094,here is something that also confuses me..........  When you purchase a boat from someone else go to the mto office to gain new plates on the ownership you list the serial number of the trailer pay the taxes get the plate.....its my understanding that even after that the actual trailer isnt transfered into your name...that being the case Im going to assume there are lots of trailers out there not in the current owners name....and am I correct in this one
336310,Fisherman,2009-04-29 14:08:00,7201,"Ah, go check the registration for the trailer, it will have all of your info on it, why would it remain in someone elses name?"

336433,charlesn,2009-04-29 21:02:00,551,Would like a Canadian Tire be able to do it?  Most auto garages are not the easiest to navigate with a boat in tow.  At least CT has a nice big parking lot.
336437,irishfield,2009-04-29 21:06:00,26272,Wouldn't be my first choice... but a garage is a garage. You have to have your tow vehicle safetied and the trailer.

Make sure you have ALL your safety chains anchored and hooked up properly.  Your tires are of good shape.  You have the proper hitch installed.  Your boat is secure.  Your trailer brakes are working.  You have ALL the appropriate documents.  Oh yeah, they will be watching us. The wrong do'ers are what has them up in arms....  The time has come to be aware and safety conscious..  Enjoy opening day!!!  Nipper"
334014,ranger520vx,2009-04-23 18:17:00,164,"We've have been discussing this on BIG FAT BASS recently and it is NOT rumour-its caught me by surprise.  I'm lifting the begining of the thread and pasting below.  Apparently, MTO regulations that have been in effect since 1994 will be more strictly enforced in the near future. This is due to an increase in incidents resulting from unsafe towing on our roads. The O.P.P. have recently received training on trailer safety issues, and will be conducting Province wide ""blitzes"" in conjunction with the MTO in an effort to ensure that standards are being met, and to maintain safety on our roads.  Any vehicle (ex: your truck!) and trailer (ex: the one with your boat on it!) must not exceed a combined GVWR (Gross Vehicle Weight Rating) of 4500 kgs/9920lbs without both the truck and trailer receiving an annual safety inspection at an approved MTO Inspection Station. **It is important to note that the ""GVRW"", is not the actual weight of your vehicle(s), it is the maximum load rating of your vehicle. It is different from the Gross Vehicle Weight (GVW). This information is usually found on a sticker that is located on the door or door post of your vehicle/trailer, or on the sticker that is located near the tongue of your trailer.  If the combined GVWR is less than 4500kg/9920lbs, then you are fine. If the combined GVWR of your vehicle and the one that you are towing is in excess of this weight, then you are required to have annual safety inspections done on both. Vehicles that have been inspected will display a bright yellow sticker, which will make it easy to ensure that you are in compliance. It's really important for us to check this on our own vehicles, since most tandem axle trailer/truck combinations end up being over 4500kg. There are very few exceptions to these regulations with regard to the towing of boat/snowmobile trailers, etc. My husband was told by MTO officials that fines will be determined by the number of kg/lbs over the acceptable weight, and you will likely be required to unhitch your trailer from your vehicle on the spot if not in compliance. It would suck to have to leave your bass boat sitting on the side of the road because you got stopped on the way to a tourney!!!  More information can be found on the MTO website: http://www.mto.gov.on.ca/english/trucks/re...ns/annual.shtml  If you have questions or concerns, it would be wise to contact your mechanic and mention Circular 31 of the MTO Safety Regulations.

334094,irishfield,2009-04-23 22:24:00,26272,"I've been nailed for this before towing my 36' triple axle with absolutely no weight on it. Female OPP officer (after they chased me down with two cars and boxed me in like a take down) with tape measure measured axle centre to centre to determine it's weight capacity supposably (give me a break..it's 9 tons lol) and charged me with ""failure to show device"". I think it was a $180 fine back then... divide that by the number of years since 1989 and I'll take a few of those over the yearly safety expense. Anyone that knows me knows I dont' drive or pull junk (the odd truck that the wheel falls off.. but.. ) . They never even asked to see lights work, brakes work.. and then I drove away. Also got the lecture on S hook chains... ""have to be closed blah blah blah"". Well they are now... but according to MTO's website closed hooks are only a SUGGESTION.  As for this 4500kg GVWR... guess I'll be pulling my rig across the weight station short of North Bay on the way to the lake and keeping the weight slip. Maybe I'll just drop my boat on the scales and get a weight for it. My boat trailer has a GVWR of 7000lbs/3175kg. actual boat and trailer with a full fuel tank and gear don't weigh more than 4500 lbs / 2041 kg. My truck.. based on the GVWR on the ownership is 3000 kg. So based on what I'm doing I should be legal.. now if I somehow manage to put a deck on the boat trailer and tow concrete blocks.. maybe not !"
334101,JeffBornFishin,2009-04-23 22:42:00,260,"More and more officers are taking it upon their own iniative to do spot or random vehicle stops.  Something else I have learned recently...an OPP officer is trained enough to do a road side vehicle seizure including plates without being a licened motor vehicle mechanic.  That means they can do a quick inspection and see if your vehicle or trailer is in fact ""fit"".  A few weeks ago we were out for a tour and came across a single officer in Madoc.  He was stopping all traffic...check drivers licence, insurance, sticker on the plate etc.  It is good to see.  Keep the crap off the road eh"
334104,irishfield,2009-04-23 22:50:00,26272,Just be sure you have the trailer ownership in the tow vehicle glove box !! The big thing they're looking out for is stolen boats and trailers. Might even want a copy of the vessel licence in the tow vehicle.... will save you unsnapping the trailering cover and trying to get to the glove box on the side of the road.
334115,JeffBornFishin,2009-04-23 23:11:00,260, Neighbour down the road is on the Peterborough County OPP Marine unit...they want to see proof of vessel registration and insurance on the water every time they stop someone for an inspection...they just wave at us on the water   kinda nice.  I have been told if you are behaving yourself and wearing your life jackets they may move on to someone else  I have copies in the boat  The trailer ownerships always in with the tow vehicle.

334159,irishfield,2009-04-24 00:43:00,26272," I know that Rick.. but never hurts to have the numbers anyhow... and also note been a long day and my math was wrong and I'm over the weight anyhow even with real boat/trailer weight. What they should realize is a dual axle trailer is safer than a single. Everyone with a double axle trailer, or a 3/4 ton truck pulling a single, is going to get hit with this. Even if you pull the decal off the trailer tonque I'm pretty sure singles are considered 3500 lb and duals 7000. You'd think they'd put the GVWR on the trailer ownership.. but instead they put it's actual empty weight. The really dumb one with this ""crack down"" / legislation is I can haul an RV trailer that's a lot heavier than my boat and they're exempt ! Recreational should be recreatonal use period !"
334169,Fisherman,2009-04-24 01:06:00,7201,"I checked the link and sublink and came up with this portion under exceptions for light duty trailers. In this case I was informed they only use the tongue weight of the trailer added to the trucks weight to make sure you are under the 4500kg rule. The ""Vehicle Permits Regulation"", made under the Highway Traffic Act, provides an exemption for light trailers, specifically;  ""where a trailer transmits to the highway a total weight of 2,800 kilograms (6,173 lb.) or less, that weight shall not be included in determining registered gross weight""."
334184,irishfield,2009-04-24 01:43:00,26272,"That's what I understood based on the RV magazine yacking about this weight reg for the last few years.. So you go to the scale and weigh just the truck with the trailer attached to it and that's your weight. Then as long as the trailer itself on the scale.. still attached to the truck... weighs less than 6173lbs your good.  Now if they go by ""sticker"" GVWR on the trailer.. all dual axles are probably outta luck.  Just have to find the list of ""light duty trailers""."

This regulation was originally written to target small contractors with a single truck and tandem axle work trailer in questionable condition..not guys hauling their boat to the lake or RV. Interesting how the RV trailers are exempt.. well not interesting they lobbied to keep them ""out of the equation"". I'm apparently illegal to haul a brand new boat and trailer behind my 4 wheel drive, long wheel base F150.. but someone can hook it up to a little car with a lower GVWR and their total GVWR would be legal. Extremely dangerous though..."
