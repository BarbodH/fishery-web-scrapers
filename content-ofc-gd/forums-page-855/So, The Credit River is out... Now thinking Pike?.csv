Mississauga spots (for Pike)... I know Mississauga really well, and have been living there for almost 25yrs of my life! LOL  I mostly go fishing near the DownTown area (Hurontario & Lakeshore). I just wanna see what places are suggested.... see if I've gone there before....  Thanks! Rob  EDIT: BTW.... Does anyone know where a good place to go for LARGE MINNOWS? (preferrebly Suckers) in Mississauga for PIKE?? I'm going to try ANGLING SPECIALTIES in MISSISSAUGA... but incase they don't have large enough baitfish.... Does anyone know where they might carry bigger baitfish for PIKE?  Thanks Again!"
