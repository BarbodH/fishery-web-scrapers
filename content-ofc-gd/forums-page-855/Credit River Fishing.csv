336109,profisher25,2009-04-28 23:12:00,185,"I am planing on going to the Credit River sometime soon, but I have never fished there before. I think I will be hitting the Culhan Trail footbridge, or at least in that general area. Is there any good fishing there? And if so, what are some top lure choices for trout?  Any help would be greatly appreciated.  Thanks in advance!  Profisher"
336170,rbaquial,2009-04-29 01:40:00,968,Go to a Float/Fly Fishing Specialty Store.... like Angling Specialties near  Confederation Parkway & Central Parkway West  in Mississauga....Not too far out from where you are planning to go fishing.  There's apparently another Float/Fly Specialties Shop on Dundas St in Mississauga  (right beside the entrance to  Erindale Park ... I've personally never seen it (I used to live around that area for the last 20yrs of my life!) but yeah.... maybe someone else would be able to shine some light if this store does exist?
