336628,Bob,2009-04-30 13:11:00,370,Just east of Buckhorn near Lakehurst. http://www.mto.gov.on.ca/english/traveller...sheets/Map5.pdf
336633,Jer,2009-04-30 13:35:00,1426,"It's tucked right between Pigeon, the Balds and Upper Buckhorn with a creek draining into Upper Buckhorn. It's spring fed and has no boat access to the bigger lakes. Beautiful turquoise colour and nice and sandy.  I've never fished it as there is no public launch but assume it has the regular Kawartha fish species."
336744,jediangler,2009-04-30 19:56:00,1923,"The beach is very popular in the summertime. Nice looking lake. Like Jer said, when you check it out on google map the colour is amazing."
337141,buckhorn250,2009-05-01 21:10:00,85,Not the best fishing lake in the area. Very shallow (hence the color) and mostly sand bottom (hence the name).
337145,Beans,2009-05-01 21:20:00,3339," About half way from Buckhorn, ON and Nanook's house...  West of Buckhorn off Lakehurst Road...P'Boro is about a half hour away"
337235,Nanook,2009-05-02 02:24:00,565,"If you are coming via Buckhorn Narrows, you will get to the lake within about 10klms. I only know of 2 launch places and they are right on Lakehurst Rd. I believe that the fire Rte you are looking for is on Lakehurst Circle. I can check it out and PM you if tou like?"
