Wednesday I went back to re-check my regular spots... My best places were still barren, but I found about 10 Crappie around the boat launch. This afternoon, at 3:30 when the neighbour's 9 year old got off the School Bus, Daddy and I were waiting for her with the boat and tackle. We only had two hours, before supper time, but we managed to get another 15 from the same spot.   The water was 62F degrees or 16C in that little pocket and there was some new weed growth. My guess is that the other spots will start to pay off in a couple more days."
