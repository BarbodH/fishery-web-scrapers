We went to a completely different place [for us] and had a great trip - every kind of weather you can imagine.  Unfortunately and not surprisingly we were a bit too early, but it was our only option as Ian starts a new job on May 4.  The fish didn't really start biting until Thursday when we caught 11.  Mike - drop me a line when you get back and I'll tell you how we did and where we went [assuming I remember to check this website cuz I'm always on the climbing websites]  Cheers, Pete"
