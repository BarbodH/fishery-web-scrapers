337281,Crazyhook,2009-05-02 12:59:00,1154,He was just trying to get his son some Nooky! what a good dad would do!  In all honesty Guy is an awesome guy. I used to play hockey and took karate with his oldest son. He was always signing autographs for the same people week after week. He was one of the NHL greats- who do you know that used to smoke 2 packs a day could skate that fast!
