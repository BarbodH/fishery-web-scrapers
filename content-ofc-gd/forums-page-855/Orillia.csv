336908,bigugli,2009-05-01 03:11:00,6138,"Long story short, Wife won't let me go too far without another person in tow. I'm not well. Things happen  Got the son up real early and in Orillia by 7. Not bad.  ""Shoulda bin there yesterday"" was all I heard. Not that we didn't catch fish. Hundreds of dinks everywhere. Every once in a while there would be that we glimmer of hope for a better bite. 10 hours later I'd only put together 2 feeds. The son added one. Met a young couple new to perchin and showed them how to rig up and switch to minners. They were having a blast. Funny thing is he spent most of the day sleeping in the car(woman plumb tuckers him out  ) So for me it was a nice day out. There were a few moments where I needed to sit. Mother would have been right PU'd if I had fallen in again. Even more PU'd at the son for crashing in the car. Here's the evidence:     I could sit along that Orillia shoreline for a month straight and never get bored."
336924,Terry,2009-05-01 09:44:00,14456,yummy nice perch
336925,sonny,2009-05-01 09:47:00,511,"nice catch!!,,,just a question,,,,did you find a lot of eggs in em,,,look like there already spawned out,,just looking for a timeline is all!"
336933,Radnine,2009-05-01 10:37:00,1538," Speaking of PU'd wives, WOULD IT KILL YOU TO CLOSE THE CUPBOARD DOORS?"
336936,b2kptbo,2009-05-01 10:48:00,1505,"Supper and good time getting it, WTG..."
336949,bigugli,2009-05-01 11:41:00,6138,They were all spent and on the post spawn feed. A lot of the fish caught were coughing up other meals.
336955,corvette1,2009-05-01 11:59:00,1765,congrats bruce
336957,Greencoachdog,2009-05-01 12:12:00,8163,"Sounds like a good day for you!!!  ... but... uh.... if you can't stay out of the water, there's a thing called a PFD... maybe you've heard of it?  Please read my signature!"
336972,JohnF,2009-05-01 12:51:00,3494, You do good wife imitation.  JF
336981,crappieperchhunter,2009-05-01 13:19:00,2582,"Bruce you where up in my stomping grounds and I never got a call  Sounds like you had to work for them...but it's never really ""work"" is it? I'm like you...I could sit there and do it all day.  Enjoy your fish fries."
336983,bigugli,2009-05-01 13:30:00,6138,"Been a little off the mark again lately, so I only decided on rolling myself out that evening when the son offered to drive."
336984,jjcanoe,2009-05-01 13:36:00,744,good job on the perchies!  jjcanoe
336985,bigugli,2009-05-01 13:42:00,6138,"It's not the water that's the worry, it's the rocks and logs and concrete I keep landing on. At least the water don't hurt  Seriously, yes I could wear a PFD, and yes I could wear a safety bonnet, and yes I could use a cane, and yes I should also carry a portable chair. Or, I could follow one Dr's advice and find a safer hobby like needlepoint or tiddlywinks  I'm still not as bad as Bill Dance"
337212,Leecher,2009-05-02 01:34:00,7832,Great report and pics Bruce  Glad that you went out and had a good time... good looking feed of perch Thanks for sharing Jacques
337216,smokin joe,2009-05-02 01:46:00,226,"Good on ya Bruce glad to see you made it to Orillia this year after all     Wish I could have brought the boy and joined you, but work has different plans for me, I even have to go in tomorrow  Nice looking feed of perch you got too  Oh BTW ""curious george"" said to tell you that you and Bill are in big trouble when he see's you for all the catfishing you guys have been doing without him"
337221,bigugli,2009-05-02 01:53:00,6138,Curious George is worse than me for going swimmin and scaring the fishies
337259,Big Cliff,2009-05-02 09:31:00,6899,Really nice to see you getting out and catching some nice fish too Bruce. Good report!
