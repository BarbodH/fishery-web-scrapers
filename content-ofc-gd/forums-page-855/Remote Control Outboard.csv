337296,fishinggeek,2009-05-02 14:09:00,325,Came across a good deal on a remote control outboard.  What's the difference between a remote control model and a traditional model?  What are the advantages and disadvantages?  Sorry I'm a newbie when it comes to owning a boat.
337300,ohhenrygsr,2009-05-02 15:02:00,947,Well with a remote control one you have a handheld  device that you put batteries in to operate the outboard and boat from shore.  It's quite fun.  LOL a remote control one means that it comes with the throttle controls instead of the tiller style outboard.  Remote controlled.    Tiller
