336537,NAC,2009-04-30 03:16:00,369,"I hit the big river after work today and the fish were very cooperative.  It was my fourth steelhead outing of '09 and the first 3 only yielded 2 fish. It started looking like things were going to be very slow after only hooking 2 fish in the first 3hrs...  lost both...  my fault.  I used the same rig as the last outing without cutting back the line.  I should definitely have known better by now.  The last hour was very productive and I ended up landing a pile.  I tried doing the self portrait by using a tripod and timed delay function on the camera.  Things didn't quite work out as hoped, but you get the idea from the pics.  I even did a trial run to make sure, but didn't account for these feisty fish trying to escape during the shot.  I never caught a single fish on roe.  Flies, jigs, Berkley worms(orange peel) and spinners all worked well.          Trial run.   I need to work on the self portraits, but it was a lot of fun regardless."

336671,CLofchik,2009-04-30 16:03:00,854,How was the water level? I've heard with a new tunnel project they're doing it gets really high & rockin' in the morning and doesn't settle down until later in the afternoon.
336704,MJL,2009-04-30 17:24:00,2427,Awesome job!  I only started fishing the Niagara for steelhead last year and was amazed at how hard those fish pull.  Certainly different than what I'm used to fishing.  Have the minnows started coming in yet?  I was awestruck at how black the water was with them.  Never seen anything like it except on the Discovery Channel with sardines and anchovies.
336733,silvio,2009-04-30 19:15:00,433,Wtg bud some nice fish you got yourself.

336798,Leecher,2009-04-30 22:41:00,7832,Good work nomad     Beauty trout for sure Thanks for sharing Leechman
336881,dheitzner,2009-05-01 02:12:00,314,"Gotta love the Niagara steel, real nice fish."
336883,Joeytier,2009-05-01 02:18:00,3990,Some beauty steelies there!  Nice going.
336884,splashhopper,2009-05-01 02:18:00,2931,"I really liked the fish that was ""thaaaat big""  in the last pic. lol"
336915,NAC,2009-05-01 04:06:00,369," There's definitely some strong fish coming out of there and they need to be to navigate those currents.  I didn't see a lot of baitfish around in the areas I was fishing, but you could definitely see the steelies chasing them around close to the surface nearby.    The water level was very high(4-5ft more than I'm used to) and never seemed to drop in the time I was there later in the afternoon.  Hopefully I'll be working in Niagara again soon before the run really tapers off!"
336927,Paully,2009-05-01 09:50:00,712,The pic without a fish turned out best.....
