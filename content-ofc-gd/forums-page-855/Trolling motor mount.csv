336975,wmshaw,2009-05-01 13:04:00,42,I am thinking of buying a boat with a 12 volt 56 lb motorguide trolling motor already on it and I currently have a better 24 volt minnkota that I would want to use on it.  Are the mounting holes for the Motorguide the same as Minnkota?  Would there be an adapter plate that could be used to mount the minnkota using the motorguide holes so that I would not have to drill any more holes on the boat?
