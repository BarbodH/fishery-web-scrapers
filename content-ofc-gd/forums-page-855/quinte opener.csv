337002,sonny,2009-05-01 14:21:00,511,"I'll be monitoring channel 68 also,,,no boat name,,,just sonny!"
337005,Stoty,2009-05-01 14:31:00,2910,"I'm heading there for the weekend as well. Also in the derby. First time fishing quinte on the softwater...so hopefully we get into some fish! Top 10 prize would also be nice!  If anyone see's two young guys in a Blue ranger with ""Lunkerhunt"" stickers on the windshield....give me a holler!"
337025,LeXXington,2009-05-01 15:28:00,1928,"Good luck all, this is the first year I had too pass in a long time  stay safe"
337050,lew,2009-05-01 16:34:00,12766," Stoty, long line 6"" minnow baits close to shore after dark......then go collect your prizes"
337061,Stoty,2009-05-01 17:03:00,2910," Ya, I figured trolling was the best option for the Bay. How deep are they right now? Shouldnt they be a little shallower than normal right now? 10-15 ft?  Thanks for the tip!"
337063,lew,2009-05-01 17:12:00,12766,"Can't say fer sure how deep they are right now Stoty, but in 2 weeks we'll be getting them anywhere freom 8-12', so that should be a good depth for you to try.  Blue/clear/orange Long ""A""s trolled about 100' back from the boat have always proved to work best for me after dark.  The pickeral usually stay active till around 11 or 12 at night then shut right down."
337069,Raf,2009-05-01 17:31:00,3495, what about the walleye?
337117,young_one,2009-05-01 19:36:00,620,"Ill be there! White Tracker Tundra, 150HP with a kicker! Deseronto area."
337134,mbac31,2009-05-01 20:14:00,904,leaving in a few also. Tracker Avalanche with 3 guys. Starting tonight till tomorrow night. BOOYAH!!!! Good luck to all.
