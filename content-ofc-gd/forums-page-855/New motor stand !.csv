Grandpa decided to get to work, Who needs plans eh ? haha  This is what he came up with by the time I came back by lunch ! Oh ya, I dropped the wood off that morning around 8am ! I guess retirement = boredom for my Granps !      Its not to short and not to tall... I still need to add some wheels to it to make it nice and mobile !!!  I wish I had the skills like my Grandpa... He does great work !  "
