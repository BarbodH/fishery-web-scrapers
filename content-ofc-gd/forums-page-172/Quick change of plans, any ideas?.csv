918814,Raycaster,2015-06-06 14:26:00,528,"Was hitting LSC Sunday Monday but weather says no.  Looking for suggestion in Kawarthas (better weather) to catch and release as many PIKE as possible. I have a friend that has the patience of a 5yr old and just want to keep him happy.  Was thinking Mitchel/Balsam/Buckhorn but I had a neighbor say Beech Lake was worth the extra hr drive North. Not really looking for monsters, basically quantity over quality.  Heading out from Hamilton.  Thx ahead. "
918815,lew,2015-06-06 14:37:00,12766,  Was thinking Mitchel/Balsam/Buckhorn   Kawarthas isn't where I'd be heading if your looking for lots of pike. There's a few in the area now but there's other spots I'd be heading.
918817,dave524,2015-06-06 14:50:00,4508,"Inner Bay at Long Point is good for lots of smaller pike, close to Hamilton."
918818,bow slayer,2015-06-06 15:03:00,1074,"Rondeau,lots of pike"
918821,Sinker,2015-06-06 16:06:00,8692,The only kawartha pike your going to get are in balsam/canal/mitchell......for the most part anyways.  S.
918822,Roy,2015-06-06 16:21:00,13728,Would Cook's Bay be an option?

918850,Musky or Specks,2015-06-06 21:00:00,2710,  This. The lake is stupid with pike.
918853,Raycaster,2015-06-06 22:27:00,528,"OK, Sparrow lake for starters!  Time to look for a launch and motel and Tim's.  Again thank you for help guys, I'm more than happy just out fishing but my friend gets out maybe 1-2 a year and is hyper..."
918921,misfish,2015-06-07 15:39:00,29133,There is a small motel at the exit to sparrow on hwy 11. Also a little resturant. You can launch at Lauderdale marine. Hit duck bay and fish the deep weed drops. Work the bay good. Lots of pike. Husky jerk in bass pattern.
918922,misfish,2015-06-07 15:42:00,29133,"Oh and if you both golf, theres a course right accross the street from the motel, also there is ST. Georges. Nice long ball hitter course."
918928,Locnar,2015-06-07 16:17:00,645,Dalrymple is littered with pike as well.

919065,Raycaster,2015-06-08 19:57:00,528,"Just an update:  Hit Sparrow Lake Sunday morning and I had 2 pike and 2 bass before noon but my buddy had no luck.  Left at noon and hit Balsam while the weather unloaded on us. I'm usually on Balsam first week of July and had trouble finding the usually weed beds. Whitecaps stopped any real venturing and I was only able to quickly unhook some OOS bass. The temps dropped to 65 in the lake and between heavy rain and wind we didn't have a lot of luck.  Thanks again to all suggestions, much appreciated."

919164,Rizzo,2015-06-09 11:42:00,4754,"     ...sounds about right. I was gonna head there on Thursday...just saw winds are 40-50 km gusts that day. Had a few hairy days on Balsam in my past, don't think I will add to that list "
919183,misfish,2015-06-09 12:50:00,29133,Not sure Mr.G. I manage to do both well enough to enjoy. LOL
