But I have a good buddy with a new boat who has taken me out a couple of times. We headed out on my home lake to get some crappie and were not disappointed.  All up shallow, hitting live and plastic baits.  Got into some hammer handle pike too which were infesting the crappie areas and even trying to take crappie we were reeling in.  We tried for bass too, Vibrax spinner in fire tiger was very effective.  "

919480,miller,2015-06-10 23:51:00,223,"Can't beat a good day of crappie fishing, I use my old 13ft float rod with a spinning reel for them it's a blast, get far casts, picks up slack line for hooksets so easily, and great for twitching from a distance."

Amazing fishery for sure!  Sure is Joey, after the spring though they are nearly impossible to find!"
919672,limeyangler,2015-06-12 13:12:00,5204," That is an interesting method. I used a 11 foot light spin rod for casting big slip bobbers when ocean fishing for mackerel. Like you said, good for getting and con trolling long casts.    Damn... Looks like a good time Yeah, it was extra good cause the guy with me is my fishing buddy of old and gads moved back to the area after 3 years away.    It's the Simon show     Great vid bud!  LOL…yeah, the videos are getting longer and longer.  surprised you guys have cabbage weed already!  Great times. Its just starting to grow up, a bit like me…lol.    Love seeing the northern ON crappie reports! thanks for sharing! The crappie up here are really prominent species now, lots of lakes with big populations, can't wait till they migrate to my shore."
