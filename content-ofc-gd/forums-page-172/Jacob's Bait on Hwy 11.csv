919105,Rizzo,2015-06-08 22:56:00,4754,Anyone know what time they open this Thursday? I once showed up before their regular hours and the young lady taught me some words that would make a sailor blush.   Have been calling them but they don't answer the phone.
919107,Roy,2015-06-08 22:58:00,13728,They probably have call display.

919111,irishfield,2015-06-08 23:03:00,26272,But was she cute in her PJ's Roger??
919114,SirCranksalot,2015-06-08 23:15:00,3291,"why would you ever give your business to a place like that-----after they 'gave you the business""?"
919117,Fisherman,2015-06-08 23:47:00,7201,"why would you ever give your business to a place like that-----after they 'gave you the business""? Because a scoop of minnows is like a barrel full."
919119,Acountdeleted,2015-06-09 00:09:00,2562,I think they may be closed. If not they are closing sometime this summer.        Unless they changed their minds again.
919145,Dave Bailey,2015-06-09 04:38:00,1641,"why would you ever give your business to a place like that-----after they 'gave you the business""?  Two reasons:  1) Everyone has an 'off day'.  2) I love it when they talk dirty."
919154,misfish,2015-06-09 10:03:00,29133,"It,s not the same any more. Lots of complaints about it. Word is the son is going to take it over. Sure hope he builds a new bait building. The one now is going to collapse anytime."
919162,Rizzo,2015-06-09 11:34:00,4754,But was she cute in her PJ's Roger?? ...better than the last lady in that regard...but the last one was waaaaaayyyy friendlier. At this point in my life I will take friendly over sightly any day
919163,Rizzo,2015-06-09 11:38:00,4754,"I think they may be closed. If not they are closing sometime this summer.        Unless they changed their minds again. ...haha ya it has been a few years since I was there....and that is what I was told then. Thats why I thought I'd better ask. Is it still operational? Do they actually open each day etc. I remember going there in the past and they pretty much ignored their own posted hours. I like in the old days I would just go in middle of the night, help myself, and leave some money under the coffee tin in the corner."
919191,SirCranksalot,2015-06-09 13:40:00,3291,...better than the last lady in that regard...but the last one was waaaaaayyyy friendlier. At this point in my life I will take friendly over sightly any day  My question as to why seems to have been answered!! Sounds like you've reached the stage where 'getting lucky' is more related to having your rod in hand!!
919263,SuperDave,2015-06-09 21:22:00,204,"Maybe its just me, but I would buy my minnows from someone who actually wants my business."
919266,irishfield,2015-06-09 21:30:00,26272,"If I opened at 5am and you showed up at 4, I'd be swearing too !"
919316,Rizzo,2015-06-10 02:30:00,4754,"...more to the story...I asked them to leave the minnows outside....was told don't worry, we will get up...I warned them that if they don't I would be absolutely relentless and would really prefer they just set them out the night before that way I don't have to wake them...was again told, don't worry we will get up...when nobody got up I was friggin relentless (phone calls, doorbell, knocking)....about 10 straight minutes....I was relentless as warned(and I did get my minnows)"
919320,PUMP KNOWS,2015-06-10 03:24:00,937,^^^ haha...thats hilarious
919333,misfish,2015-06-10 09:38:00,29133,"Let me guess, you told them your line of work? LMAO"
919343,Rizzo,2015-06-10 12:39:00,4754,..the problem was it was the young man who said don't worry we will be up...but he was nowhere to be found as I was banging and calling and knocking...it was the young lady who had to deal with the barrage
919349,misfish,2015-06-10 13:17:00,29133,And you were such a nice guy when you lived in Barrie.
919488,BowSlayer101,2015-06-11 00:46:00,296,"Not closing anymore, the woman I find is less friendly than the other guy but she gives ALOT of minnows! The son is OK but the woman gives the most minnows, bucket full for 5 bucks, don't care who the person is honestly, just want to get as much minnows as possible lol. The lady is nice to me though, we've had a couple conflicts in the past but all good now."
