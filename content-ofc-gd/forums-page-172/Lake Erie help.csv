I am not looking for hotspots, just general area's, even depth's to look for.....Naturally we are targetting Walleye or Perch, either will do.  He has a 2013 20' boat with a 150 on it, so we can make the rounds.  Any general help with depths or locations and certain techniques would be helpful.  Thanks"

When we first started targeting Walleye we would fish off the hydro plant to the tip of Long Point. Just head out and start covering water and you will find patterns. Keep a journal of where, when, temps and fish. When it comes to strategy your best bet is to comb the water. i do outside boards high with 20 jets and way out. (200 ft of the board) Then 10 to 6 colour on the inside boards, dipsy divers and riggers. Cover the water from top to bottom tell a pattern shows. I like to run stick baits but also do well with worm harnesses. In the end it is all about time on the water and bringing everything you have learned together to catch fish consistently. Good luck."
