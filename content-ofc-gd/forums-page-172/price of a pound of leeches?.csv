919177,bow slayer,2015-06-09 12:26:00,1074,"Just curious what they charge these days for a pound of leeches?  Also some suggestions where to pick them up on way up highway 11 to powassan,thanks."
919178,porkpie,2015-06-09 12:42:00,2521,"Well perfect timing with your post, I was just thinking of the same thing for our month end trip to Restoule."
919184,bow slayer,2015-06-09 12:57:00,1074,"wow small world Restoule is where I am headed,I usually go get them in Nipissing at Bowmans bait but it is kind of out of the way was hoping to get them on 11 somewhere."

919195,Mister G,2015-06-09 14:02:00,1429,"1/8oz all black jig and about 1"" pinch of a nightcrawler will do the same as a leach."
919196,bow slayer,2015-06-09 14:05:00,1074,"leeches are more durable and easier to store then worms,just keep them cool and change the water."
919201,Lunkerhunter,2015-06-09 14:29:00,455,I drove up to timmins 2 weeks ago and stopped by most of the bait shops along the way for leeches.  most expensive was billy bobs in north bay @ $ 60 per pound  cheapeast was gramps place in temagami @ $ 45 per pound
919247,EC1,2015-06-09 19:02:00,930,"You need a bait license to hold more than a small amount - which was why my family hasn't bought a pound of leeches in a while.  http://www.ontario.ca/document/2015-ontario-fishing-regulations-summary (Page 10)  But I'm sure if you can find it - good for you, because leeches by the dozen are way too expensive."
919251,gaspumper,2015-06-09 20:16:00,393,"Your allowed to have 120 leeches in your possession,per person."
919259,aplumma,2015-06-09 21:09:00,6896,The only time I  almost bought leeches the joker put the leeches in a 16 oz measuring cup with water and tried to sell them to me as a LB of leeches.   Art
919326,Freshtrax,2015-06-10 04:39:00,2215,"Not much help on the bulk leaches, but by far the best smallie bait after a live crayfish..., but gone are those days."
919361,bow slayer,2015-06-10 13:59:00,1074,"well Bowman's in Nipissing just quoted me 40/pound or 25 for half a pound. Looks like I will grab them there,half pound works out to about 8-9 dozen."
