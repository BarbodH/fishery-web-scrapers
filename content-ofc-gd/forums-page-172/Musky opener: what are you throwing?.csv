918592,Freshtrax,2015-06-05 03:09:00,2215,"I will not fish Muskie, I will not fish Muskie, I will not fish Muskie.....anyone want to take me Muskie fishing?"
918613,singingdog,2015-06-05 10:37:00,1047,Sorry if I hit nerve Chris....just trying to keep a conversation going.
918631,TenInchJake,2015-06-05 12:46:00,21,"A Suick is indeed a jerkbait and not a glide bait. Hellhounds, Mantas, and Phantoms are glide baits. Glides tend to be neutrally buoyant and you work them side to side (walk the dog). A Suick or similar jerkbait tend to be more buoyant and you work them in a more chopping retrieve. They dive and then float up.  I'll mostly be throwing inlines of various descriptions, and maybe some jerkbaits, glides, and even a topwater or two."
918637,mike rousseau,2015-06-05 13:12:00,4661,Thinking glides might be the ticket with the post frontal conditions.... Gunna try the all faithful hellhounds...  I'll be trying my new manta 10... I haven't even seen its action yet...  And I got a really nice cowgirl to try out...  I ordered some reef hawgs but not in time for opener
918640,Brettiop,2015-06-05 13:32:00,279,Ill probably start the morning throwing a few egg head spinner baits by handlebarz lures...  After the first lure who knows what ill clip on though
918652,Gregoire,2015-06-05 14:30:00,1397,For the first time in a few years I won't be heading out for the inland opener. Instead I'll be tossing around my 6 month old.
918685,cowanjo,2015-06-05 17:10:00,249,"Wont be the same Roaring Dan, who is going to net my first of the year, I have Keanu Reeves (AKA Mike) acting as the replacement.  In terms of baits I will be throwing something that is Purple, likely a custom made Anvil bait which is awesome."
918689,Dontcryformejanhrdina,2015-06-05 17:22:00,535,"Inline spinners, sledges, and I'm sure I'll throw some hell hounds and top water. My fianc√©e wants to catch her first musky so hopefully we can find a successful pattern quickly."
918723,Sinker,2015-06-05 20:11:00,8692,"As long as its orange and black, it really doesn't matter  S."
918759,Fisherpete,2015-06-05 23:07:00,1814,"Greg, I would go with the Big Nasty, a Tranx and 100 lb powerpro to do this. You get maximum baby tossing distance that way."
918763,lew,2015-06-05 23:27:00,12766,"As long as its orange and black, it really doesn't matter  S.  There ya go !!"
918856,Weeds,2015-06-06 23:27:00,782,Some kind of super sized Len Thompson 5 of diamonds missing 80 percent of its paint. So more like a 2 of diamonds with a unique patina. No takers either way unfortunately.
918860,Gregoire,2015-06-07 00:16:00,1397,"Pete, First off, the Tranx only comes in righty, so there is not way in hell you will catch me casting with my wrong arm, as I am right handed. Secondly, I'm pretty sure that tossing a baby for musky would be better in the fall, so I will wait until then."
918866,manitoubass2,2015-06-07 01:04:00,11391,Hahhahahahaha
918876,Fisherpete,2015-06-07 02:23:00,1814,"Oh yeah, forgot about no lefty Tranx. Guess you can slum it with your Conquest.  In the fall it's actually better to throw pre-schoolers as the muskies prefer a bigger meal."
918904,Gregoire,2015-06-07 12:21:00,1397,"In that case I'll have a wait a few years, or see it I can trade up."
918944,fishindevil,2015-06-07 21:24:00,6254,Well i went walleye fishing in Haliburton yesterday and I almost always 99% of the time catch a musky in this lake everytime I walleye fish it !!!! Well I not only got skunked on walleyes I got skunked on musky as well !!!! Brutal day on 2 species .... And the few musky guys we talked to caught nothing either !!!! Very slow painful day !!!!
918949,Kerry,2015-06-07 22:38:00,383,I had a small guy follow on a home made in line spinner I call the skunk.A single large silver/copper blade with black Yak hair and a little white in the center with some flashabou mixed in.We switched over to walleye fishing after a couple hours and got 4 but two were in the slot.So at least we got a taste for the day.Dang wind sucked today. Kerry
918970,singingdog,2015-06-08 10:12:00,1047,"Seems I was wrong about going small. 3 of us landed 9 Musky over a day and a half of fishing, with several others lost right at boatside. Most were in the 25-30"" range, with one just over 40"". We weren't throwing huge lures, but much bigger than last year: #7 Mepps Marabou was my best for the weekend. Spent a fair bit of time throwing smaller inlines, topwaters, and cranks with no takers.   The walleye were very shallow in one lake we fished: 4-6 FOW, and hitting in fairly bright sunlight....strange pattern."
919009,msp,2015-06-08 15:30:00,1336,At around noon we decided to abandon the musky. Only 1 small fish boated and some OOS bass. Went to a different lake and targeted pike. The move paid off

Great picture."
919128,singingdog,2015-06-09 01:06:00,1047,"my brother was catching walleye off our dock in 6 FOW all weekend mid day...something was happening for sure,  Must be awesome to reel in a ski off a yak so cool. Great picture.  Yep, musky in a yak is a blast. In some ways, it is easier than from a bigger boat. You can fish lighter gear because the yak is so much lighter and doesn't stress equipment near as much as a larger boat. The ski in the pic hauled me around for about 10 minutes before getting tired enough to land. Landing/unhooking can sometimes be easier because you are so close to the water."
918368,singingdog,2015-06-03 18:32:00,1047,"Water temps are still pretty cool here in the Highlands. Last year on opening weekend, the only fish we got were on pretty small offerings: #4 mepps, regular sized Jitterbug, 3/4 oz spinnerbaits. I'm thinking I might stick with smaller, slower presentations this weekend. What are your plans?"
918373,lew,2015-06-03 19:01:00,12766,I won't be fishing till musky opens on Nipissing in a couple weeks but as always I'll be throwing a very large orange & black bucktail to start.
918379,mepps,2015-06-03 19:31:00,1301,"Small worked for last years opener for me too, but not quite as small as your baits. #5 Mepps is typically as small as I go, and I like to remove the stock hooks and go with bigger ones.  For Kawartha muskies, the #5 Mepps muskie killer is one of my go to lures. My own spinner baits also have been productive (#8 french blades, brown marabou)  Last year Fidel and I had 4-5 muskies in about 3 hours of fishing, and then I got a few more the following weekend. A slow rolling Tackle Industries MiniD also landed a nice walleye and muskie on back to back casts (from shore!)  pics added!          "

918398,fishindevil,2015-06-03 21:15:00,6254,I will just be walleye fishing as usual and will catch my opening day Muskie that way !!!! Lol .. It usually never fails ... And if course in a few weeks when bass opens here in FMZ17 that  usually produces a ski or 2 !!!! Lol

918421,musky666,2015-06-03 22:04:00,126,Will be trolling spinnerbaits over the emergent weed growth...
918425,Rich Clemens,2015-06-03 22:25:00,3131,"Wondering.   Just how many times have you said that.   Ha Ha Ha. One of these years, I may actually listen to you."

918442,Rich Clemens,2015-06-03 23:28:00,3131,I may just happen to have a bait with orange in it.   A gift from MistyRiver a few years back.

918470,Rizzo,2015-06-04 02:21:00,4754,"a shadrap in perch flavour twitched over some weeds ought to do the trick. I have one that is all beat to heck....lots of chomp marks and many fish caught on it....then I have another in mint condition, fish seem to ignore that one....that's the one I will give my buddy when he gets upset I am catching and he isn't"
918481,Lunkerhunter,2015-06-04 03:53:00,455,Glide bait or bucktail for sure
918487,outllaw,2015-06-04 11:12:00,1232,open week. trolling a 6 inch georgie bait or fishing deep a 10 in chewie. if were runnin shallow will be heaving handlebarz bucktail in that new orange tiger pattern.

Good Luck.  Seeing a lot of nice fish being caught on Mike's lures.    Wouldn't mind a couple myself. Let's see some pics of the big girls.

918522,msp,2015-06-04 16:15:00,1336,hopefully some kind of topwater

918557,captpierre,2015-06-04 21:48:00,2521,Hey. What is a glide bait?
918562,chris.brock,2015-06-04 22:11:00,4053,"Glide bait is a Suick or similar bait.  I'm definitely not an expert, but my go to bait up there is a black, inline bucktail spinner. I like early September better than the opener though.  PM me if you want to compare notes on Haliburton skis."
918563,Handlebarz,2015-06-04 22:23:00,3790,"Well if the winds allow us I will start off with our blades before first light Electric black after that we will change up sizes and colours deepening on the water color here on LSC. I will also be trying out a friends Anvil jerk bait some plastic will be in the water also. Sunday we actually have plans for some trolling I have a selection of Georgies and barz that will be behind the boat looking for that one piggy to eat.  Good luck to everyone this opener and year.  Remember that Handlebarz musky lures have our 50"" club going if you catch a 50"" musky on our baits just send in the picture and story we will send out a 50"" pack for you.  Cheers"
918580,singingdog,2015-06-05 00:36:00,1047,"Hmmm, I don't consider a Suick a glide bait. Dahlberg wide glide, Glidin Rap, Hellhound....I think of those as gliding baits. Suick is more of a jerkbait."
