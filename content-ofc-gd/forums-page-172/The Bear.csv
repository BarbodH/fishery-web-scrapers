918760,Steve,2015-06-05 23:11:00,2075,"I fully agree with the action of the police in this situation.  Sure, there is a good chance the MNR could have sedated the animal and brought it somewhere else (likely to get shot, just not in front of a bunch of city slickers).  But, if something bad was to happen, with all that media around, the cops would have been trounced. And I don't think that would have been fair.  They handled it well. It sucks the bear was shot - certainly, it does. However, the cops handled this situation safely."

There was a lot to the story I didn't know about at the time, such as the proximity to the school, etc. But upon further investigation the end result was probably the only option. I was just going by what I heard on terrestrial radio at the time (102.1 FM and 590 AM - so yeah, two very reputable sources on the info). From what I heard, everyone mishandled the situation. Also, I wasn't there, and I doubt anyone else posting to this thread were there either. If this had happened where I grew up it wouldn't have even been a story, and probably nothing would have even come out of it, and the bear would have disappeared into the hinterlands.  I'm also pretty sure this really doesn't affect anyone, so taking the fact that people are upset about it personally is only going to hurt your own cause."

919113,SirCranksalot,2015-06-08 23:14:00,3291,It seems to me that the police didn't have much choice given that (1) they are not equipped with tranq guns and transport vehicles(nor would you want them to be because that's MNR's role) and (2) MNR took forever to get there(arrived just in time be too late).

918496,Moosebunk,2015-06-04 12:09:00,3970,"Today on Global National.  In Newmarket Ontario a crowd assembled in the downtown core to gaze in wonder at the amazement of one ferocious black bear napping in an actual tree.  Scared for their lives several bystanders called the Ministry of Natural Resources, all simultaneously receiving the same voice mail prompting them to call sometime back into the 1980's when they still did exist.  Frustrated they Instagrammed and Facebook'ed selfies of themselves (duh) with the bear in the background and, later that day we learned the same black bear wasn't only in Newmarket at that time, but, it had been seen all across Canada.  Most accurate source of info locating the furry carnivore reports that it was Ewout Blom of Holland that actually first sighted the bear.  It was in fact eating a smaller bear somewhere around Turtle Lake before it wandered to Newmarket, climbed a tree, and entered into it's food coma after the meal.  When Police arrived on scene, one clever constable thought that offering donuts to the bear might help coax it from the tree.  Hoping it might feed on Boston Cremes and Honey Crullers, the meat would instantly sweeten before they could finally execute the bear.  Meat would be given to the local Legion, all the old timers in Newmarket would be fed, the world would continue to turn.  Unfortunately, the bear didn't want the donuts when it came down from the tree.  Instead, spooked by all the bystanders, flashing lights and men with guns, it took off running towards a yellow car which it probably presumed was a honey bee on return to it's hive but was in fact a school bus.  (if only Wynne had banned yellow cars a little sooner)  Boarding the bus, kids screamed and cried as the bear entered into a frantic state, ripping limbs from Sally Jay, Tommy Chung and bus driver Moe.  Escaping the emergency exit, last child out wisely closed the doors trapping the bear.  Several hours later once the Military arrived, the bear was captured and transported to Newmarket Psychiatric Hospital.  Charges will be laid against the bear, and there's rumor that Mother Nature may stand trial for it's role in the crimes committed today.  Until that time, the bear is currently undergoing psychiatric evaluation, although pending that, it is expected the bear will plea not guilty to any charges.  We will be following up as more news comes in.... Global National, the Moose."

918599,Freshtrax,2015-06-05 03:51:00,2215,"  Its best to prevent encounters with bears in the first place.  But if a bear continues to be a problem  and youve exhausted all other alternatives  as a property owner, you have the right to protect your personal property and yourself.  Any action you take must be:  carried out with the most humane means possible done in a safe manner in accordance with any applicable laws (e.g., discharging a firearm by-laws) You do not need a hunting licence.  But if you kill a black bear, you must report it immediately to your local Ministry of Natural Resources and Forestry office.  If you want to keep the dead animal for personal use, you must register for whats called a Notice of Possession with the Ministry of Natural Resources and Forestry.  It is strongly advised that killing a bear in self-defence be an action of last resort."
918605,Paudash,2015-06-05 04:24:00,273,"we had a similar situation with a moose at our cottage 5 or 6 years ago.  A young moose about 18 months old was trapped on a small island with about 20 cottages on it.  There was a little causeway to get to the island that the moose came across but would not go back across even when we tried to scare it across.  The MNR kept on saying it would go away but it never did until one day it fell asleep on a person deck and they were trapped in the cottage for the day.  The next day the MNR finally showed up and we thought they would tranquilize it, we were wrong they just shot it dead"

918424,DRIFTER_016,2015-06-03 22:21:00,10439,"As for protocols involving bears, they are very hesitant to tranquilize them in urban areas as it takes time for the bear to go nighty night and in that time it can injure someone. Especially if in an area near a school or playground. We have had numerous bears wander through town here in Yellowknife and there have been a few that were frequenting areas where there are children and they were put down. Others in less populated areas of town have been trapped and relocated. This does not usually work if the bear has become habituated to peoples garbage though. You can dump them in the bush 100 miles away and they will usually be back in a few days. Then they get shot."

918440,Freshtrax,2015-06-03 23:26:00,2215,"One of the stories in the book, Reid said, describes an interesting time in his career when he worked alongside two SWAT teams to capture a bear that escaped from the Stevensville zoo. “Before I could get there, [the bear] was actually just sitting on a farmer’s front porch at midnight on their couch,” said Reid. “[The farmer] went outside and saw the bear and panicked.” When the SWAT team arrived they set off a stun grenade, and Reid said the bear ran off before he could get to the site. Throughout the next day, the bear was on the loose in town. “They actually shut down the whole town. They had to cordon off the area until we got this bear,” he said. “We had two SWAT teams and they really wanted to shoot the bear, so I had to convince them that we could use my little pea shooter of a dart gun and dart him, capture him and bring him back.” Surrounded by news reporters and camera crews, Reid said he was 40 hours without sleep by the time it was all over, but memories of that day back in August 2007 still stick with him so vividly even seven years later. “It was a wild situation, but it had a good outcome,” he said."

Put into the cage and taken who knows where. Not to second guess the YRP, but if they tried to get it out of the tree, then that sounds like a bad decision. Should have let it be like the last one. Then bring it down with a dart.

So sad but true.   Same thing happened in Peterborough a few back where the MNR office is, and the cops still had to come out and shoot the harmless Bear, which was 5 minutes away from the office,  Also happened with a Turkey at the junction of the Hwy 115 and Hwy 28, again the OPP's shot the turkey as it was on the side of the road getting gravel, and they thought the Turkey would be a distraction for drivers.  Im sure it happens all over"

From what I heard about the Newmarket bear, it sounded like they were trying to scare it out of the tree, and when it did come down they shot it anyway? What was the thought process? (rhetorical question - there was none)  I think they need to make the entrance exam for the police force a little tougher. I had a friend growing up have their dog shot by a police officer because it was ""on the loose"" even though it was still on private property.

The said they killed the Newmarket bear because kids were on the street going to school but from what I understand the police were there at 6:00 AM when they called MNR. Seems to me they could have been driving around the neighborhood getting peoples attention with the siren and then broadcasting to stay indoors.  And I believe that bear was in the area for a couple days so it would seem the MNR would be aware of what was going on and could have been ready to head there faster rather than taking a couple hours.  I dunno know, maybe I'm wrong.  And Steve, that story about them killing the turkey is nothing short of insane."

The bear was up a tree not far from a school and everyone and their kids ran out of the house to watch the bear.  MNR was called again, and they took 2 hrs to respond  Scared and confused bears can turn violent pretty quickly. Had the bear turned on a child in the area then police would have had to answer why the bear wasn't put down. Damned if you do, damned if you don't  Always easy to armchair quarterback net minder especially after the MNR a was called several times and they never showed up.

We need to hound our MPPs as to why the MNRF is unable to respond to these events, in due course. It's all about the money. Especially since these events will be happening with more frequency, because of the cut off of the spring bear hunt. I was a hunter years ago. I would not shoot bears because my family would not eat them, and I didn't want a rug in front of the fireplace. I have no qualms about those who do, or did. The Province, and the economy lost a lot of dollars when the hunt was cancelled. The same groups that objected to the hunt, now object to the result of the handling of the bear problem. Their objection didn't help in the first place, and is no help now. Are they out there helping to raise funds for the MNRF to provide services to areas with over population of bears? In a word....NO! Don't blame the police. They were put in a position that is truly outside of their normal mandate, by the politicians who were pretty scarce when the event unfolded. Typically. Thats my 2 cents worth, for today."
918392,Dara,2015-06-03 20:29:00,3052,"The Liberal govt is turning the whole province into a joke. All they want to do is pass laws restricting our freedom and expanding their unaccountability.  How does the Hydro one CEO still have his job  How come our insurance coverage is limited by law just because Kathleen promised to get insurance rates down  At least the cops will take care of a bear before a kid gets mauled  Now, when are the OPP going to arrest Kathleen for election fraud"
918393,misfish,2015-06-03 20:30:00,29133, Unfortunately many people that don't have any experience with wild animals will make the wrong decision.  Yes
918394,davey buoy,2015-06-03 20:32:00,5505,"I just don't get it,no one has a phone?,no conversation, I don't believe for a minute that there was some kind of a timeline from the MNR.Short of staff I get it.No one as of this morning has come out and said why they could not wait longer and mnr for there lack of no show.Just sayin ."
918395,Dara,2015-06-03 20:50:00,3052,"The MNR doesn't want to be involved anymore...its a bear, let the police deal with it.  We have them all over town, nobody bothers anymore.  They did trap one a couple weeks ago because it was right downtown and would never find its way out. If there is no trap, shoot it..just make sure you use a 30-06 so you stop it right now instead of a 38 special and chase it around"
918397,fishing n autograph,2015-06-03 21:13:00,2540,MNR won't come out unless a bear is stationary. They didn't come out after the first call because it was moving
918400,fishing n autograph,2015-06-03 21:21:00,2540,"According to the dispatchers they were calling non stop and getting ""we are on the way"" but no ETA was given"
918402,davey buoy,2015-06-03 21:31:00,5505,"According to the dispatchers they were calling non stop and getting ""we are on the way"" but no ETA was given Maybe,funny how they showed up 10 mins later.I just think this was a easy way out.Loads of cops,Bear was going no where.Agree if it headed towards kids or someone ,ok.Sad anyway.."
918408,fishing n autograph,2015-06-03 21:48:00,2540,Lol if you're interested there's a protest rally against the YRP at Fairly Lake tonight...
918411,lew,2015-06-03 21:56:00,12766,Lol if you're interested there's a protest rally against the YRP at Fairly Lake tonight...  Because of the bear shooting Dave ?
918413,leaf4,2015-06-03 21:58:00,2466,Could it not have been tranquilized? Cops don't have access to those or what?
918414,davey buoy,2015-06-03 21:58:00,5505,"Lol if you're interested there's a protest rally against the YRP at Fairly Lake tonight... Hoping something good may come out of this.Lol all you want,I had hoped it would of been handled better."
918416,fishing n autograph,2015-06-03 22:00:00,2540,Ya MNR a could come out and do their job instead of throwing the police under the bus
918417,musky666,2015-06-03 22:02:00,126,"Yep, rally is because of the bear shooting. I also read a release about this that said the MNRF and other non essential services are facing a further 5.5% budget reduction- who the heck gets to decide that MNRF and our natural resources are non essential?"
918418,davey buoy,2015-06-03 22:03:00,5505,"Ya MNR a could come out and do their job instead of throwing the police under the bus I end it there Dave,two different sides,it is what it is.Hope there is new protocol for something like this."
918419,fishing n autograph,2015-06-03 22:04:00,2540,Yup. A million problems in the world and the community and they are upset about a bear.... Not the increasing domestic violence or drugs or gang violence... But a bear
918422,fishing n autograph,2015-06-03 22:04:00,2540,Doubt it. This was the second bear in 8 years in our area. Not a common occurrence
918423,davey buoy,2015-06-03 22:06:00,5505,Doubt it. This was the second bear in 8 years in our area. Not a common occurrence Glad your positive .  .
