Traffic lights were pretty much irrelevent, same as lane markings.  I was on a 3 lane highway and there were 5 cars across it.   Also saw 2 5-8 year old girls in the bed of a pick-up truck with 2 guys in the cab on the highway.  The 2 car parts to wear out first were the horn and high beams as they were going non-stop.  Mirrors and turn signals were not used."
