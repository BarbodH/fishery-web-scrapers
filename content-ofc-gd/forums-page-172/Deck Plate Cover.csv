I'm looking for a 6"" dia. black cover with the tab style lock. I can buy a whole new unit but that comes with the base part that mounts to the boat. That would be about $50-$70. I know where mine is...QEW between the Red Hill overpass and Burlington St. As much as I'd like to save some cash, I don't want to qualify for the Darwin to do it.   "
