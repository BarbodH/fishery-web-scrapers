706540,trasker,2012-06-17 14:06:00,26,"Yes, Daniel has a great love and respect for nature, particularly the beautiful and spiritual Temagami backcountry.  He loves to fish, ever since he was little.  Appriciate any help in trying to find him.  If anyone is familiar with this area, please pay special attention to what to look for and what to do if found.  Focus on Diamond Lake and Lady Evelyn near the liftover area, but also surrounding area.  Daniel was resourceful and could have gotten further than we believe.

I can't help in the search but what I will do is keep Daniel and you and your family in my prayers. I hope other board members will do the same. God bless."

753095,kickingfrog,2012-12-19 01:29:00,8333,The January 2013 Reader's Digest has an article about this still missing young man.
753109,trasker,2012-12-19 02:30:00,26,"  Hi kickingfrog, the article is a ""condensed"" version of the original article in Explore Magazine, fall edition.  Here's a link  http://explore-mag.c...d-a-missing-man   I should also mentioned that we had to start a new page on ottertooth, the original is now archived.  Here's a link to the news brief http://www.ottertoot...efs-133.htm#no3  along with a link to the latest forum page http://www.ottertoot...html?1351874553   We appreciate all the support and ask that those in the area remain on the lookout.  We will resume our search in the spring, unless something turns up before that, patience..."
753121,solopaddler,2012-12-19 03:21:00,8605,"This quote from the Explore article hit home: “His intention was to brave the elements and have the sort of experience that broke him or made him different,” says Poukhlov. “He wanted to bring some justification to his life—something different from working as a roofer or hanging out in bars.”  I lived a very similar lifestyle in my 20's and early 30's. Mostly working menial jobs to simply finance my next expedition into the bush. Often I'd leave for months at a time with no word to anyone what my route was. My longest excursion was 4 months, mid May to Mid Sept by myself.  After reading the Explore article I could only think my God that's me. Then thought my God how could I have ever subjected my parents to that torture? The thing is young men sometimes can have a selfish viewpoint on life. I know I sure did back then. It doesn't mean that I didn't care for and love my parents...  For what it's worth those solo trips were life changing. Eat when you're hungry, sleep when you're tired, and travel wherever you please. Food, clothing, shelter, transportation, everything one needs to live and survive happily is carried on your back. A true testament to how little one really needs to be happy. Eventually there is no lonliness only incredible peace as you truly become one with your environment. A confidence is instilled that if one can accomplish this, nothing is impossible.  There's not much doubt in my mind...regardless of what happened...that Daniel was doing what he loved.  My thoughts and prayers to you and yours Maureen."

We find solace in knowing Daniel is where he would want to be and was following his own journey his way.   It's still difficult, not knowing one way or the other if he is alive or with the spirits.  So, we will continue to search, hoping to get this troubling question answered..."

805507,big guy,2013-08-29 14:27:00,414,"One thing I find odd about all this is that there is no mention of what type of canoe Daniel had, unless I missed it. I read all the stories about it, did he not have a canoe with him? If he did, it seems odd that they have located so many pieces of clothing and gear, but no canoe, which is obviously considerably larger. Most canoes and boats are designed to float at water level if swamped, just seems very strange to me that if he had one with him, it has not been found."
805508,solopaddler,2013-08-29 14:31:00,8605,"So glad to hear this, I'm praying you find your boy."
805509,irishfield,2013-08-29 14:34:00,26272,He did not have a canoe Big Guy.. he was on foot as far as his parents know.
805510,trasker,2013-08-29 14:37:00,26,"big guy, Daniel did not take our canoe from home.  Although there were an abundance of canoes at Camp Wanapitei and stashed canoes up there, we believe he was walking the shoreline.  But, no way of knowing for sure.  A number of abandoned canoes were found and checked, but no evidence of use by Daniel.  Again, so many possibilities.  At least we know he is/was in this specific area, narrowing our search down to about 50kms.  When he went missing (Nov. 3, 2011) the small waterways were beginning to freeze up, but there were a few warm days where water travel may have been possible.  Based on where his winter clothing and back pack were found, we believe he was walking."
805530,big guy,2013-08-29 16:26:00,414,"Thanks for the reply, now it makes more sense to me, definitely an arduous task finding someone in an area that big.  May God be with you."

645177,NAW,2011-12-03 22:27:00,4022,"Most people don't know this, but Ontario has several Volunteer SAR teams.  I am very surprised I didn't get a call on this.  The OPP must think they have things under control. Or the OPP officer in-charge has something against volunteers..  That happens a lot  .  The OPP is very very hesitant to call in volunteers, even if they are highly trained, and certified.  Hey Billy Bob, volunteer firefighters in Ontario, at least the ones I've worked with, are not trained enough as they should be in Ground SAR.  They are great in the water, and ice, but when it comes to bush whacking, not so much.  Ontario is a little messed up when it comes to utilizing willing volunteers."

Daniel has been missing since Nov. 3rd.  Only sightings were his car being found on Red Squirrel Rd on Nov. 11; a clerk who believes he bought fresh produce (fruits and vegatables) from the Temagami grocery store on Nov. 3 or 4, and that he asked for a map at the gas station on Nov. 4.  He is believed to be in Temagami backcountry.  Ground, air and water searches of the area have been conducted serveral times, but no sightings to date. "

647044,trasker,2011-12-10 15:03:00,26,"Hi, I'm Daniel's mom, Maureen.  We have been working closely with the OPP for ground, air and water search efforts.  This includes the Bear Island Police doing shoreline water search.  The problem is we don't know exactly where he is.  OPP have also done ground search with dogs, as well as Daniel Cyr from Massey, who volunteered his dog (Hunter) search services several times, and he plans to continue again.  We were fortunate to have an expert of this area, Hap Wilson assist with OPP ground and air search efforts.  They are now waiting for snow, will then decide if another flyover is doable, looking for tracks or signs of Daniel.  My husband, Don, is retired from Kitchener Fire and our older son Adam, is a full time firefighter there now.  Everyone is willing to do a search, but I have to agree, these are specific search skills for getting through the bush.  My husband has been up twice assisting OPP with search ang providing information about Daniel, where he might go.  He too checked out various vacant cabins with a friend, not an easy trek, a definite learning experience for them.  Daniel was up there most of the summer canoeing, portaging, living on his own in the bush - but winter is a different story, and he has no communication devices and no information was shared with us before he left, big puzzle for us to put together !  Daniel is very resourceful and can likely find a place and edible plants to feed on.  However, we are very concerned for his safety and well being, we need to know he's OK.  Please get our message out to trappers, prospectors, snowmoble clubs or winter hiking clubs who may be in this area, every set of eyes will help.  We understand that others want to help, but searching through this area must be done in a coordinated way to be most effective and ensure the safety of the volunteers.  Any thoughts/ideas would be appreciated, tks."
