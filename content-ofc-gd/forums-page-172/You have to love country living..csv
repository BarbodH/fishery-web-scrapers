919304,mikdor,2015-06-10 01:06:00,109,I agree with You Lew we have a camp and years ago dreamed of living there when We retire and the Wife said no way. But as time went on She says with an addition we could do this in the summer but in the winter We have to be where its warmer. So I gave in now this is what I get pics of on my trail cam. Sorry it says my file is to big to download I will post later when I figure out how to do it. Mike
919334,bigugli,2015-06-10 11:00:00,6138,  Guelph and K/W  are boomtowns. Land getting so expensive that  young Mennonites have been moving up to the 17 to find affordable land to homestead.

919346,SirCranksalot,2015-06-10 12:57:00,3291,"Lew,living in the sticks never gets old.The pic in my avatar is my wake up view for 6+ months of the year.In the evening the loons sing me to sleep. The other time is spent on 160 acres with the GF's 3 horses roaming the back 40 & almost  daily visits from the local deer population. On some cold & quiet nights the wolves howl very close.  Enough already!!"
919362,LeXXington,2015-06-10 14:03:00,1928,"oh, if i could only move outside of the city.  Your living the dream Lew.!"
919152,lew,2015-06-09 09:57:00,12766,Just sitting here wandering around the internet and glanced out the window and there's a pretty little deer walking down the road.  Last week it was a bear in the back yard.  Don't know why I ever lived in the city
919153,misfish,2015-06-09 10:01:00,29133,There were cougars in the city Lew.  Have a great day bud.
919156,lew,2015-06-09 10:13:00,12766,Cougars are everywhere Brian LOL
919169,Rizzo,2015-06-09 11:54:00,4754,"haha cougars. For most of us living in the city is to help out the wife and kids (schools, shopping etc) or to be close to our jobs. Once those things aren't priorities anymore I hope to find what Lew has. But for now I have found a balance...out my back windows we have other homes but out my front windows we have forest or farmers fields. We are the last house on the edge of town"
919172,lew,2015-06-09 12:08:00,12766,"haha cougars. For most of us living in the city is to help out the wife and kids (schools, shopping etc) or to be close to our jobs.

919174,Rizzo,2015-06-09 12:12:00,4754,...too far from fishing is the problem! Close to 3 hours to St Clair or Kawarthas. In 20 years when I am ready to retire maybe you will sell me your place
919175,lew,2015-06-09 12:15:00,12766,"In 20 years when I am ready to retire maybe you will sell me your place  No, but I'll rent you the loft above the garage if you'd like"
919197,fishing n autograph,2015-06-09 14:07:00,2540,I wish my wife would agree to live in the country... I'm afraid that is a losing battle. The new house is about 500 yards from the grand river
919202,Beavertail,2015-06-09 14:37:00,331,"I hear ya...I'd do just about anything to live in the country but it ain't going to happen for awhile either. Compromise is buying a place on the edge of town but where we live (Waterloo Region) the price of even a small property is crazy! Lew, sounds like you are a lucky man."
919205,SirCranksalot,2015-06-09 14:50:00,3291,"Not to go 1 up Lew, but here in Wasaga we saw 3 deer on my neighbors lawn last nite----but he scared them away, probably because of his newly planted tree. Goslings swimming on the river this AM. Miss the smell of fumes on the DVP though!!"
919206,Rizzo,2015-06-09 14:51:00,4754,but where we live (Waterloo Region) the price of even a small property is crazy  Bingo...I am in Guelph. What the heck is with pricing in this area. Ludicrous. Piece of junk on a half acre lot $500k or more
919207,lew,2015-06-09 14:59:00,12766,"Not to go 1 up Lew, but here in Wasaga we saw 3 deer on my neighbors lawn last nite-  The more, the merrier  "
919208,manitoubass2,2015-06-09 15:01:00,11391,"I love country living! Its awesome.  This place we have is dirt cheap, 600/month for 4 bedroom 2 bath.  Its funny though. Just down the road there is this wicked house id love to buy, 175,000.  Drive ten minutes west and a 4 bedroom is in the 40 to 50 thousand range"
919210,NAW,2015-06-09 15:14:00,4022,"This post makes me smile ear to ear Lew!!  I used to have an nice estate lot in the bush.  But I had to sell the house in my divorce.  Moved to crappy house, on a crappy street in Barrie.  And I can not stand it.  I think me neighbors have seen me naked more time than I can count!!  I'm just waiting on the final paper work.  But it's  about 99.9% sure that I am moving to Midhurst Aug 1st.  To a home that backs on to a big forest, that's county land, and chocked full of walking / biking trails!!   I will be able to walk out my back door and disappear in the bush again.!  FREEDOM!!!  I intent on setting up some feeders for the birds and deer, and I hope to be posting pic like you have been by the fall!!!"
919212,manitoubass2,2015-06-09 15:25:00,11391,"Did I ever get around to showing you this pic of our cat playing with a deer at our old place Lew? Well here it is anyhow, they even rubbed noses a few times lol  "

Oh & the night skies,you can't see stars like that in the city."
919217,Beavertail,2015-06-09 16:08:00,331,"This thread is killing me! I hear Loons in the evening too...but they are flying down the Expressway on sport bikes or tricked out Civics with fart pipes! Serenity now, serenity now..... Come onnnnn 6/49!"
919218,manitoubass2,2015-06-09 16:18:00,11391,Country life is awesome!  I like that I can pee in my yard???
919225,outllaw,2015-06-09 16:57:00,1232,"agh the country life. I just saw a rare city bus go by. also some rare specimens in my back yard,called starlings I think. gawd I love the smell of diesel in the mornings..   enjoy the county life boys. wishin I was thar."
919231,lew,2015-06-09 17:36:00,12766,enjoy the county life boys. wishin I was thar.  First summer we were here the wife & I were sitting on the front porch one evening just enjoying life when these folks came down the road past the house.  I knew then I'd made the right decision to get out of the city LOL  
919233,Rod Caster,2015-06-09 17:41:00,5784,"Do you find yourself casually waving to your visitors 'oh, hello there deer' haha.   I lucked out big time finding a perfect county home on 160 acres at the dead end of three, count em, three dirt roads. Yesterday I had a wolf show up and bug my dog..it was a really weird encounter, almost like they were friends, but I don't trust that thing for one second. Either way, it's never boring and it's almost always perfectly quiet. I love seeing all the different animal tracks on my km's of trails."
919234,lew,2015-06-09 17:49:00,12766,"Do you find yourself casually waving to your visitors 'oh, hello there deer' haha.   I don't wave to the critters but I sure do spend alot of time smiling these days LOL  Your 160 acres sounds fantastic."
919241,manitoubass2,2015-06-09 18:19:00,11391,160 acres???  You better get to work man.
919242,outllaw,2015-06-09 18:19:00,1232,that's awesome lew. now im more jealous.. do ya dodge the horse buns driving on the roads there lol
919264,netminder,2015-06-09 21:22:00,514,"Some day I'll move to the north. I grew up out in the country, first on a farm and then in a couple houses out in the bush. short walk to the creek and lake, lots of logging trails to ride teh mountain bike on...  Hell I should be looking at the municipal websites to see if I'm in demand. Never know. Wife's on board and that's all you need to know!"
