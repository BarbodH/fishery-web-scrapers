919393,captpierre,2015-06-10 17:06:00,2521,Hi Guys. I have a small trailer that came with a Hobiecat sailboat. Not using it. Thought I could use it to trailer the ATV. Would this be legal to convert using plywood and 2x4s  and u-clamp everything to the frame. Homemade ?
919398,Terry,2015-06-10 17:28:00,14456,is it plated now as a legal trailer
919409,Fisherman,2015-06-10 18:20:00,7201,"Yes, just make sure it's not one of ""those"" trailers that MTO looks for, you know, gun tape, baler twine and bubble gum holding things together."
919707,captpierre,2015-06-12 17:15:00,2521,"When I picked the used sailboat/trailer up, it had no plates.  Drove it home anyway. It's a Proper galvanized boat trailer with lights. So if I make a well built platform on it and get plates it would be legal on the roads? I guess it should say on it ""max weight"" somewhere."
919731,Fisherman,2015-06-12 19:00:00,7201,Did you get a bill of sale?  Somewhere on the tongue it should have the VIN and capacities.  Either shorten the tongue and call it a home made trailer and register it as such.  You may have to get it inspected.
919798,Freshtrax,2015-06-13 01:44:00,2215,"I just registered my homebuilt double axle boat trailer, in and out of the mto in ten min. with plates and ownership no inspection required."
919799,Freshtrax,2015-06-13 01:44:00,2215,Just make sure it's safe.
