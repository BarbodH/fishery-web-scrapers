918988,davew3,2015-06-08 13:49:00,430,"Good morning.  With living in Burlington it is a pleasure getting to the trailer on the BOQ.   I used to take the 407, then hwy 7 to Courtice rd. then down to the  401 . But with the construction on hwy 7 I have been going down Brock rd.  Once we hit the 401 it becomes a zoo.  Does any one have an update on the hwy 7 route from Brock rd (hwy 1) east?  Or any better ideas?  I may just start leaving at 9 pm and do the night drive.  Any info would be appreciated  Regards"
918991,Raf,2015-06-08 13:52:00,3495,that's a hard one and would make me wanna sell the trailer on quinte. having to go across the gta is a poopstorm anyway you slice it.
918999,FloatnFly,2015-06-08 14:33:00,1640,"head south on brock, then take taunton rd across and pick up 7 again after oshawa"
919001,Sinker,2015-06-08 14:42:00,8692,"Yep, not really any way to avoid it. You can go one concession north of 7 and carry on to the 115 then south to 401 though....might be a little better.  S."
919006,SmokestackLightnin,2015-06-08 15:12:00,390,Take a boat from Burlington to BOQ
919028,davew3,2015-06-08 16:44:00,430,I am looking at 3 options  1  move to Belleville  2 as Sinker said  one concession north.  We have done the Taunton way.  Depends when you are going across.  If you are there at 4 -6 pm it  takes a long time as well.  3  buy a bigger boat.  troll my way there  until they get the highways done not much to do about it.  Regards
919032,Steve,2015-06-08 17:36:00,2075,"407 will be completed by 2017 .. it will end at the 115/35.  that's when the true ""mid north"" traffic is going to start...."
919047,Garnet,2015-06-08 18:24:00,2056,So you go to the end of 407 and then go thru Brooklin and over to Simcoe St Oshawa.  You can go just keep going until Hwy 57 if you go south will take you to Bowmanville if you still keep going you will come to Hwy 115.  Just passed Simcoe at Harmony rd you could drop down (south) to Conlin rd  and go east and these options are still there.  If you went pass Simcoe to next lights Ritson Rd you could go north 1 concision or go to Enfield Rd and go north. This would take you thru the villages of Ennisklin and Tyrone and out to 115 at Boatland Canada.  I would at least go to Hwy 57.
919067,davew3,2015-06-08 20:09:00,430,"Garnet,  what is 7 like now between Brock Rd and Simcoe ?   Last time I saw a sign it was saying lane closures.  If they have cleaned it up I will have to try it again.  Regards"
919080,Garnet,2015-06-08 21:07:00,2056,It's not my regular route. I seen the signs the last time I went that way about a month ago. Blew into Brooklin no issues about 5-5:15pm little slow until across Thickesen rd.  The construction isn't likely to end soon.
919095,Jigger,2015-06-08 22:12:00,1237,"Go north. Brawley rd is a breeze on the worst days. Hwy 7 is down to one lane E of Brock now, and Brooklin has become a Sstorm as of late. Leave late Thurs or early Fri and leave the masses behind. Its also nicer for us commuters to have one less car on the road:)"
919103,spooner_jr,2015-06-08 22:48:00,193,"be careful driving across Brawley, speed limit is only 50k and the radar is out there all the time, east of Lakeridge anyway."
919112,bigugli,2015-06-08 23:05:00,6138,I learnt a long time ago to drive through Toronto after 9pm or before 6am. It makes life so much simpler.
919115,SirCranksalot,2015-06-08 23:17:00,3291,"Going South thru New York state might be a bit faster than thru the GTA in ""rush""  hour!!"
919141,Paudash,2015-06-09 03:22:00,273,I make the drive most days and have learned more times than not that just take the 401 and tough it out.  The short cuts make you feel better because you are moving but rarely do they ever really save you time.  Leave Burlington at 7 pm and you will be fine taking the 401 all the way across  My 407 bill averages about $250 a month so I try and use the 401 when ever I can to save money.  I stay off the 401 between 6 am and 10:30 am and then from 2:30 pm until 7:30 pm as a general rule.  I just drive way to much
919194,Sinker,2015-06-09 14:00:00,8692,"407 saves TONS of time when the 401 is a mess, but right now that area between brock rd and brooklin is a mess.  S."
