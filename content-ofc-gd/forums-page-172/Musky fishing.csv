919563,Hunter1620,2015-06-11 16:18:00,2,Hey everybody I'm new to this forum and new to musky fishing. Heading out to stoco and Moira next week for bass opener but also want to give musky fishing a whirl. If anyone can kindly give any advice on locations and or what's making them bite would be greatly appreciated.  Thanks!

919573,TenInchJake,2015-06-11 17:15:00,21,"Consult with your bank manager before taking up muskie fishing. Not familiar with either water body, but Lew's suggestion is good. Rocks and/or green weeds, adjacent to deeper water, preferably with current. Don't forget a proper net and release tools for safe handling."
