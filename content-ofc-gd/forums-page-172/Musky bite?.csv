919216,manitoubass2,2015-06-09 16:05:00,11391,Id say no.  Your foot would be so torn up it would be rediculous.  But who knows?
919224,leaf4,2015-06-09 16:51:00,2466,"Could be, hopefully its disinfected! Lol"
919226,manitoubass2,2015-06-09 17:15:00,11391,Actually im gonna backtrack on that.  I just looked up the pics from the guy in kenora fishing tourny that got bit.  Youd think it would look worse but maybe not.  Geez youd think one headshake and your foot would be gnarly???
919227,fishnguy,2015-06-09 17:16:00,96,The tooth pattern on the kid's foot sure looks esox-like.
919229,Gallie,2015-06-09 17:33:00,1215,"I say plausible, looks more like a bite and a yank of the leg, headshake would cause more side to side damage. Unfortunately im all to aware of how an esox bite looks with or without the head shake."
919235,lew,2015-06-09 17:52:00,12766,Those muskies have extremely sharp teeth and I wouldn't doubt for a minute that's what got him.  My worst cut from a musky tooth was 8 stitches to my thumb.
919238,Rich Clemens,2015-06-09 18:07:00,3131,Didn't Jeremey Wade from River Monsters investigate this on his recent show from Ontatrio ?
919274,Gallie,2015-06-09 22:46:00,1215,"Sorry for the hijack, but i cant find any of the river monsters new episodes, just old smash ups. Are the new ones on a different channel?"
919280,glen,2015-06-09 23:02:00,2641,It your using feet for bait don't forget hooks.
919281,glen,2015-06-09 23:06:00,2641,Ya saw some new river monsters on a different channel.  Not sure what one though. Lol.
919294,Rich Clemens,2015-06-10 00:07:00,3131,It's on Animal Planet down here right now.  Takes home the entire show to finically catch one - but that's typical.
919298,mike rousseau,2015-06-10 00:25:00,4661,I think it's fake  Mouth outline is too perfect... There would have been head shakes that would have made a sloppy outline  My opinion
919302,LostAnotherOne,2015-06-10 00:46:00,956,If I had to make a guess I'm guessing it was a 19lbs 3ozs musky.  Just my expert opinion haha
919492,glen,2015-06-11 01:32:00,2641,What size feet are they bitting on?   How much per lb are feet?
919496,Gallie,2015-06-11 01:47:00,1215,"Try hot dogs, im sure there is plenty of feet in them?"
