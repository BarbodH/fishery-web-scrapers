Maybe Terry can confirm that?  http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/calgary/fossilized-fish-found-during-excavation-in-calgary-suburb-1.3090047?cmp=rss    CBC News Posted: May 27, 2015 2:54 PM MT Last Updated: May 27, 2015 2:54 PM MT One of five fossilized fish recently discovered in Calgary. (University of Calgary) A school of fossilized fish estimated to be 60 million years old was discovered in the basement of a new developmentin northwest Calgary. University of Calgary paleontologist Darla Zelenitsky is calling the discovery very important. Edgar Nernberg, who works for a local excavation company, found the fish while digging a basement in the neighbourhood of Evanston. The five fish were found in a block of sandstone in the Paskapoo Formation underneath Calgary and much of the surrounding area. The formation is estimated to be 60 million years old. Complete fossils from this time period are extremely rare. Zelenitsky and Nernberg will be hosting a tour of the site for media on Thursday."

917361,netminder,2015-05-28 11:10:00,514,That's really cool. Being 60 million years old would imply that they were around while or just after the dinosaurs were wiped out. Very interesting find.
