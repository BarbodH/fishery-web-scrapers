918939,spincast,2015-06-07 20:43:00,3279,"woke up with no plans to go. sitting drinking coffee looking windfinder. Only spot looking decently fishable is Jordan, and at 6:30, prime feed time is already 2 hours behind, but the alternative is more on the hunny do list. Having sanded the deck yesterday, thoughts of more work were pretty low on the let's-get-'er-done list . After hmmm,,,, well,,,,, should I???  through 2 cups of coffee, finally decided to just do it anyway. Solo today, the first mate over at a friends last night. Running down the highway, figuring what I am gonna set out and how I am gonna net things solo.....NET!!!....crud , boat got a good cleaning yesterday and I restocked everything but the net. The other half was up and kindly agreed to meet me 1/2 way at the off ramp. Get to the launch, not many trailers. Guess everyone felt the same way I did without the avoidance thing.  Set up 1 wire driver, 1 lead core and  run out to 80 FOW, radio check - loud and clear -  shortly hear its a lure washing station. Just moments later get a rip on the new dipsey, but then it just feels tough. Bring it all the way to confirm, release was 2 turns too tight. Ended up 3 for 7, a bent hook, some beauty weather, some enormous baitballs, and finally the first kings of 2015. This is definitely the latest since I started that I have put a king in the boat.   the taker of all but one today not too many wanted to play on the other side?  except for this one !  - the spoon was half as big as him!  See you in a couple years champ!    there is bait out there....   in the sky was something to look at as well   Jr's slightly bigger brother gave a good dash on the slash   and this one made my carpel tunnel act up, taking few fun runs and making netting with a 10 foot rod a lengthy exercise. Unfortunately. I wasn't able to get him revived, so it smoked salmon    and then there was the proverbial launch ramp entertainment... but that is another story. Nice way to finish the weekend   Could be time to look at the vacation calendar"

919030,Freshtrax,2015-06-08 17:14:00,2215,Some warm water there!   Almost 10 degrees warmer than what we were fishing this weekend past.
919099,spincast,2015-06-08 22:15:00,3279,Freshtrax - a couple spots were 65 on the surface. Hungry hooks were about 50 - 80 foot below
