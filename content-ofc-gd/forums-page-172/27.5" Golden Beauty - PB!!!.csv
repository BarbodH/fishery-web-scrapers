Thanks singingdog!!!  Beauty of a fish!   Nice job on the catch & release!  In 2 feet of water, WOW!!  Thanks Walleye72!!!  She was cruising the shoreline for a lunch.... guess the hot&tot was the ticket that morning  I've always said that the best looking fish, or the fish that looked most like a fish should (if that makes any sense...) is the walleye. Beauty catch, BTW. Hope to get into a few of those next week.  Thanks netminder!!!  Beauty for sure   Good luck on your hunt next week!!!  Beautiful fish! Good job on the pb.  Thanks Gallie!!!"
