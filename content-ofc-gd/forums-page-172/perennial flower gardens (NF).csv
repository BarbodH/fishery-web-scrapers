919570,Raf,2015-06-11 17:03:00,3495,"Can anyone point me to an active gardening forum where I could get some questions answered?  Here's our situation.  We moved into our house 2 years ago and it came with a WELL established perennial garden.  We are finding we both lack any kind of a green thumb and need to learn before we have to turn it to grass.  Outside of hostas, tulips, poppies, we can't even begin to identify what it is we have in our garden, never mind care for it properly.  I think ID'ing everything is step one!  I can start posting pics here but I am not sure the knowledge base we have on this topic.  If there's anyone in the Orangeville/Grand Valley area who's willing to see it with their own eyes (we can do the work!!), I am sure there are several plants which need division in it for you."
919572,Walleye72,2015-06-11 17:11:00,156,"Well I'm no expert, but I have been working on my perennial garden for the last 5 years.  There are only so many popular perennials that grow in Ontario that are widely available.  What ever is in your garden now is very hardy after the last 2 winters we've had.  If you post clear pics, I can do my best with identifying what you have.  As for caring for them, for starters, just weed the area around the plant well and and side dress with compost, then cover with biodegradable mulch, (Not rubber pellets).   It helps if you know the difference between the weeds and the desirable plants but it should hopefully be obvious.  LOL.   A basic garden fertilizer can be applied if you think it really needs it but I find compost has most of what's needed."
919576,KLINKER,2015-06-11 17:46:00,256,Check around your local farmers market or garden center and ask for a contact with a Gardening  club. Our farmers market sometimes has a master gardener on for a day . You would be way ahead if you can get someone to come look at it.
919618,Raf,2015-06-11 23:43:00,3495,"Good idea about Gardening Club Klinker For the most part I think we do LOL maybe after I post the below that will change.I'll post up a small sample of the stuff that's in the garden1.  >> Yellow Loosestrife ???2.  >> Blue False Indigo3.  >> LupinsTHis stuff is very aggressive and I have to pull it otherwise it chokes out others, as is the clover like stuff in the top right (I yank that stuff wherever I see it):4.  >> LungwortStuff on the right also seems to spread easily5.  Aster or Dianthus + Lady's Mantle6.  >> Hollyhock Mallow  // cranesbill geranium??sorry for calling it 'stuff'."

919624,Loonietoon,2015-06-12 00:06:00,1450,Id like to know what pic #6 is because that stuff is nice in my barrels
919627,Beavertail,2015-06-12 00:18:00,331,"1st pic - can't remember name 2nd - Blue False Indigo 3rd - Lupine 4th - Lungwort 5th - Lady's Mantle + Asters 6th - Hollyhock Mallow  Don't overthink it, gardening doesn't have to be complicated. Water, weed, mulch and maybe divide/remove plants when they they too big or aggressive. For the most part they take care of themselves."

919641,kitch,2015-06-12 02:41:00,42,"Isn't #1 evening primrose?  Spreads nicely.  I think #5 is dianthus.  I would have thought #6 is one of the hardy geraniums?   Most of my info is based on root divisions given to me by others who have said ""Here, do you want some of ....."" and I take them at their word it is actually what they call it!  \ Nice stuff you have there!"
919644,Dara,2015-06-12 02:47:00,3052,"Along with the weeding , working in a bit of bone meal in the spring and a couple doses of miracle grow through the summer.  There are some good books on Perenials that help you identify what you have.  I built my garden from a bare lot and have about 40 plants now, plus the vegetables"
919645,Kawartha Kev,2015-06-12 02:47:00,281,Number 1 is not evening primrose but not sure about yellow loosetrife. \number 6 \i believe is a perennial geranium also known as a cranesbill geranium I believe others are correct I believe.  Kawartha Kev
