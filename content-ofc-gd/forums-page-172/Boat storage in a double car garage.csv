919199,Lape0019,2015-06-09 14:08:00,647,"Had my Pro team 190 in a 20' deep garage at the old house and it was on an angle with the tongue swung in. The new house has a bit more room (Wider, not longer) but it is still on an angle and just fits. At least with the new garage though, I can park a vehicle beside it."
919228,Crazy Ivan,2015-06-09 17:22:00,184,"I moved the boat ahead a bit on the trailer to make the overall length shorter. The bunks are now flush with the transom and I have about 120 lbs of tongue weight. Now with the swing away and the motor down and turned I have about 4"" to spare at each end with the door closed. Garage is 19' 6"". Boat is 17' deep V."
919237,irishfield,2015-06-09 17:59:00,26272,"Crazy Ivan brings up a good point... your boat should ALWAYS be totally on the bunks. Your boat hull should not be hanging off beyond the end of the boards. If you trailer with the boat hanging off the back of the bunk boards there is a significant chance that you will deform the hull skin just before the transom flange. If this happens not only have you damaged your hull, but it will cause the boat to plane incorrectly / add drag / etc."
919246,John Bacon,2015-06-09 19:00:00,3277,"Sometimes even the make of the engine can affect total length...each of them has a slightly different shape I believe, might be able to shave an inch or 2 depending on brand!  Good point; I think the new Evinrudes add a foot or more compared to other motors."

Hanging over the end of the bunks can put what's called a hook in the hull. The hook will tend to push the nose into the water and reduce speed and fuel efficiency. It can cause some pretty drastic handling issues too, especially if one side is hooked more than the other. Not only will the nose be pushed into the water it can also cause a bad pull when running."

Not only will the nose be pushed into the water it can also cause a bad pull when running.  Your 100% correct Dave.  I bought a new Crestliner in '99 and as soon as the boat would hit about 30 MPH it would lean sharply to the left. I tried a few different things and nothing would help so I took it back to the dealer where they realized the hull was hooked and causing the problem. Almost looked as if the boat had been dropped and landed on something.  Not a problem for me as they just gave me a new boat and re-rigged it but could be a real issue for someone else if they damaged it themselves."
919253,SuperDave,2015-06-09 20:47:00,204,"I bought my 1775 Lund Impact and my biggest worry was fitting it in the garage. I must have measured a thousand times and tried every angle before its arrival. It fit at an angle. The garage is 19ft 6"" and the boat to swing tongue was 20' 2"". I turn my motor on an angle and I think that gives me a few more inches. Anyway, I have lots of room on both sides for garbage,lawn mower etc and about 6"" clearance to the door. One thing to remember is the height of the door frame. I had my motor tilted up and hit the frame, putting my first mark on my new motor. :wallbash:Also the windshield just clears by about an inch."
919256,jtracc,2015-06-09 20:56:00,97,"That is true, however, 120 lbs of tongue weight seems high for a 17 ft boat.  My 1750 crestliner only has an 85-90lbs tongue weight.  There is a formula that one can use to figure out tongue weight. My buddy did the same thing to his ranger, moved boat up to give more space and now his boat pounces around like crazy.

Can't go over 115-120 km on highway.  Tongue weight should be 10-15% of the package (boat,motor,trailer, gas etc) weight. 120#s of tongue weight would give the package weight between 800#'s and 1200#s. 1200#'s is pretty low if it's a nicely equipped fishing boat. My 18 footer's bare hull is in the 900-1000# range. You add a 500-700# trailer, 115 fourstroke, kicker, electric TM, 3 batteries, 18 gallons of fuel.......... you can see it all adds up.

919273,Steve,2015-06-09 22:42:00,2075,stupid question but how do you weigh your tongue weight?
919276,kickingfrog,2015-06-09 22:48:00,8333,"Bathroom scale, level ground and the trailer at the same angle as it is when on your hitch. And you then need to know how much the whole shamozal weights."

919279,jtracc,2015-06-09 22:55:00,97,Then multiply by 6% bam you get your tongue weight. I'm balls on with 93 lbs I'm about 90 lbs.  my rig close to 1600 lbs. fish hawk 1750 115 opti. 3 batteries and all the trimmings.

919291,glen,2015-06-10 00:02:00,2641,One time I had a flatbed single axle trailer and the stuff I was hauling didn't  fit.

Not really, when I ordered my new boat back in early March the dealer and myself measured a 90hp Yammy on a boat and a 90HO E-Tech and really could not see much if any difference. I would think that a regular 90 hp might be even less in length but we did not measure that motor."
919060,LeXXington,2015-06-08 19:26:00,1928,Hi All:  Does anyone store their boat (bigger than 15â€™) inside a regular city sized double car garage?  I heard you can fit bigger boats if you put the boat in on an angle.  I am looking into a bigger sized boat but I need to make sure I can store it at my house and up to what size will fit?  thanks
919062,Walleye72,2015-06-08 19:40:00,156,"I store my Tracker Proguide 162 on a shorelander trailer in my garage because the trailer has a swing away tongue.  The boat, with motor mostly down and almost touching the wall just barely fits.  I have a couple of inches of clearance at most. I was delighted to find that it fit when I got it home.  I will measure my garage floor from back to front and let you know how deep it is.  I'm gonna say a swing away tongue is a must though.  Edit:  The length of the garage is 19 feet 6 inches of usable space.  It's a double car garage and is 18 feet wide."
919063,lew,2015-06-08 19:55:00,12766,Any chance you can bumped the back wall of the garage out a few feet Paul ?

919071,kickingfrog,2015-06-08 20:17:00,8333,"Hard to say definitively, an inch or 2 can make all the difference. Some of the newer houses have very small garages. Measure your door width. Measure the depth of the garage and you've got something to work with."

919075,glen,2015-06-08 20:46:00,2641,Maybe you can add on to the front of the garage.  I take the transom saver off and tilt the motor down for more space.  A bit of a pain but ok.

During the winter we can get the truck and the van in with room to walk between ( so long as I park at least one of them, anyway:: )  Not to get too technical, but you could draw it to scale?.  - rectangle for the garage, triangle for the boat . lay the triangle over the rectangle. Mineis a full 2 car garage though - lots of newer homes are promoted as double car, but really only a car and a half. We had to add width and depth when we built to get the full two car."
