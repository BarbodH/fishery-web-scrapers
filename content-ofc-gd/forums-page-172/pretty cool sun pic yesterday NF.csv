I took alook around and noticed somethimg familar, that yellowish haze produced by forest fires.  Checked it out online quick to find it it was a few hours away, phew.  Task two, find a good spot for a pic of the sun because it always looks awesome in that haze.  Got two shots decent enough to post but youll get the idea.  Looks pretty cool! These pics are not in any filter, just raw.    "
