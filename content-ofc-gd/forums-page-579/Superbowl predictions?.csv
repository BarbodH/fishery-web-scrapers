548520,irishfield,2011-02-07 02:40:00,26272,I predict that the half time show probably sucked !
548522,BUSTER,2011-02-07 02:45:00,1336,"Someone said Irishfield was at the halftime show, Did you see him?"
548559,BUSTER,2011-02-07 04:01:00,1336,almost
548569,Cudz,2011-02-07 04:15:00,2652,"Good game that nobody wanted to win.  Too many turnovers and dropped passes in a world champion game.  Not acceptible.  Have time show lol.  Black eyed peas are very good live NOT.  Could Fergie scream any more? Rogers MVP? maybe, no one else stood out on either team.  Not a soul."

548599,Dondorfish,2011-02-07 11:36:00,1000,   - Story of my life!  -
548326,timmeh,2011-02-06 17:17:00,609,Pack 27-13.
548338,snoil,2011-02-06 17:39:00,139,21-16 GB.
548339,Dondorfish,2011-02-06 17:41:00,1000,35-27 GB
548340,Fisherman,2011-02-06 17:41:00,7201,A lot of drunks that will suffer a hangover at work tomorrow
548342,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2011-02-06 17:43:00,0,I just want the pack to win.  No prediction.  Just wishing ill will upon Big Ben.
548346,Billy Bob,2011-02-06 17:46:00,5865,Since I'm a Northeast guy and not a Mid Western fellow I'm going against the pack of predictors and saying STEELERS all the way....
548376,Gerritt,2011-02-06 19:22:00,6129,I am taking the cheese heads
548378,Muskieman,2011-02-06 19:26:00,2472,I predict that I'll be sitting on the couch watching WFN.
548380,Roy,2011-02-06 19:30:00,13728,"I've always liked GB but it'd be nice for the Steelers to take it for our Bud Marty. If the Steelers lose, it'll be bad news for the defendant in his next trial."
548383,lookinforwalleye,2011-02-06 19:54:00,4399,Buffalo 24-17!!!
548392,Gregoire,2011-02-06 20:48:00,1397,"I'd love to see the Pack win, but I have a feeling big ben will do whatever it takes to get the W."
548398,bucktail,2011-02-06 20:56:00,1857,Pitt 21-17 going to be a great game I think. If they had there center back I would be more confident. GB can defefinitly win this game!
548405,Joeytier,2011-02-06 21:03:00,3990,Uhhh...the Habs are playing...
548421,Roy,2011-02-06 21:34:00,13728, Yeah and the Habs are not doing well at all. Not good.
548422,GBW,2011-02-06 21:35:00,8460,you too? either WFN or playing Wii with the kids' here too.
548425,kickingfrog,2011-02-06 21:42:00,8333,"No fanatical interest for either team. I'm just looking for an entertaining, close game.  I do predict a bunch of sallys complaining about not being able to watch a bunch over-hyped, lame commercials that make the game last too long."
548429,Cudz,2011-02-06 21:49:00,2652,"I predict Barrie North Beats Barrie Central for the GBSSA title after already beating them earlier in the season, ending Central's 4 year unbeaten streak.  Oh wait that already happened didn't it Rob.  lol.  Just like you I too don't really care who win but want to see a great game.  I have been following both teams closely this year and actually hoped for this matchup in the Superbowl. I had Aaron Rogers as my fantasy QB and he delivered this season.  I love Steelers Defense though led by 92 and 43!!!  Either way I expect some pretty great plays on D from both teams."
548433,Cudz,2011-02-06 21:51:00,2652,Oh yeah. My prediction.  Dry field indoors - GB Wet outdoors - Pit  I guess GB wins seeing as it is the The Jones Temple. (provided that Harrison doesn't KO Rogers in the first quarter)
548442,Billy Bob,2011-02-06 22:17:00,5865,"Oh, I almost forgot....Sabres 6  Leafs 2 is my prediction for Saturday's game...."
548453,bassdreamer,2011-02-06 22:36:00,128,Steelers 24-21
548465,linweir,2011-02-06 23:08:00,202,Steelers 24~20
548466,misfish,2011-02-06 23:17:00,29133,Packers 30-Steelers 24
548472,misfish,2011-02-06 23:23:00,29133,Game time.ENJOY ALL.
548477,BUSTER,2011-02-06 23:55:00,1336, My prediction is this will be one of the best superbowl's ever
548484,Gerritt,2011-02-07 00:17:00,6129,Pittsburg kneelers?  Just sayin'  G
