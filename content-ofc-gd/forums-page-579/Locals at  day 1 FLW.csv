547476,SRT8 smoker craft,2011-02-04 00:15:00,1107,Nice Jos is beating Bob and prolly in Bob's old boat LOL Man I wish I could fish a tourny on the big O HUGE bass in there .
547488,Woodsman,2011-02-04 01:14:00,1286,How do you figure that? Different categories. Bob's total weight is 2 lbs 12 oz's more than Jos.
547496,scugpg,2011-02-04 01:31:00,1373,I believe it is Bobs old boat and it's one awesome craft. Hope they get some monsters in there!
547634,taper,2011-02-04 13:28:00,611,Do you have a link to the results? I am pretty sure my neighbor is down there as well. Josh got him into the tourneys and he loves it now.
547639,Roy,2011-02-04 13:45:00,13728,Here's some real time stuff on the FLW.  http://www.flwoutdoors.com/flwondemand.cfm
547751,taper,2011-02-04 17:40:00,611,Thanks Roy. My neighbour is 43rd right now. Hope he does well.
547816,eyefish,2011-02-04 20:28:00,135,A buddy of mine Glen Pickering is also down there and sits in 9th..he got to fish with the day 1 leader and was more than happy to net all 35 lbs for him! Including both 8 pounders!!!  
547917,SRT8 smoker craft,2011-02-05 01:59:00,1107, I realized that after I posted talked to the guys at AA today they don't think Jos made the day 3 cut but Bob had a good bag and may cash a cheque and a guy from Oakville is doing really well to but I can't remember his name .
547918,SRT8 smoker craft,2011-02-05 02:01:00,1107," Yeah it's Bob's old boat and he didn't take it, he's fishing as a co-angler no boat required."
