The HT Polar Escape Magnum 2 person flip over is on Â½ price for $259.99 The same one is on 'special' at Lebaron for $349.99, so $259 would seem like a pretty good price for anyone that is interested.  They also have the HT InstaShack pop up shelters for upto $70 off.  There's some other deals as well.  I can't take advantage of either of these this year, but thought some of you guys might like the deals."
