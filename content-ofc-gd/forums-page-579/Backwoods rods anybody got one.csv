545097,Rustic-Fisher,2011-01-29 16:46:00,826,"Got a nice float rod tied up a few years ago by Backwoods, with some custom stuff. No complaints at all.  R"
548129,hogman3006,2011-02-06 01:32:00,41," DO NOT BUY ONE OF THESE RODS. I have two of them, or rather did, and was very happy with them until I had i guide break on me last May. I contacted Dan Sturges by telephone and he said to send it in. So I did, and I ordered a third rod. Now, I am a Top 50 member and fish tournaments all the time, so I asked him to try and expedite the repair, but I had no issue waiting for the new rod. No problem, he said, you will have it back by mid June. I still don't have the darned thing back and I guess I have written it off. Customer service my butt. I also had him lined up with North Bay outfitters to carry his rods and they backed out because of this issue. Every time I emailed or called, he had an excuse. So, mister Pro staff and mister rod builder, pass this on to him. DO NOT BUY ONE OF THESE RODS. Buyer beware. Stay away. Go buy a St-Croix. I sent one back to them and I had a replacement within two weeks."
548197,BillM,2011-02-06 05:07:00,17367, Ernie!!!!  Nice to see you on here man.

174678,bbog,2008-03-21 21:50:00,665,"Cool, I like the personalization feature - I can autograph my own rods!!"
174681,pooch,2008-03-21 21:53:00,139,Now that's a name from the past. Takes me back to the old wild west OFC days!
174745,Fang,2008-03-22 00:34:00,1330,Walked by their booth at the sportsmen show wearing my OFC hat. It got the attention of 1 gent in the booth
174750,2 tone z71,2008-03-22 00:50:00,1311,"whats the story here ,I take it they where past members ???"
174755,FishHeadRic,2008-03-22 01:14:00,226,Can't go wrong with a rainshadow blank.  FHR
174784,fishdawg,2008-03-22 02:47:00,912,"""serious rods for serious anglers"" if I remember correctly...."
174786,verno,2008-03-22 02:51:00,178,Those rods are PREMIUM lol
174794,irishfield,2008-03-22 03:14:00,26272,You only have to pay $600 to be on their Prostaff.. gets you two rods ( $300) and a couple shirts and caps! Great deal to pay double and be bound to promote their product.
174847,muskymatt,2008-03-22 13:27:00,2608,"Apparently this is another kick at the can for these rod makers from what I hear and read on another site. The first kick left lots of people without cash and rods.  Seems popular opinion is, not bad rods but don't pre-pay for something you may not get.  Like I said this is just what I've read on another site but alot of peolpe claim to have been screwed by them."
175289,Garry2Rs,2008-03-23 19:52:00,1425,"I have owned several of their rods, one spinning rod, a flipping stick, a M-Heavy Bait Casting rod and a custom made Musky rod. I liked them all. The baitcaster and the Musky rod were my absolute favourites over both G.Loomis and St.Croix rods I haven't talked to Dan Sturges, the guy who ran the company in the past, for a couple of years. Therefore I don't know what's going on with them now. The problem with Backwoods, on OFC, was never the rods... It was a member who spammed every thread until his cliches became a running gag."
175314,Crazyhook,2008-03-23 20:52:00,1154,I have seen them and they are nice... personally I would rather my Loomis!
175370,Garry2Rs,2008-03-24 00:07:00,1425,"Unless your buying G.Loomis' top of the line rods, you are essentially getting the same thing. The Loomis rods are hand made by lovely young Asian girls who sit a big work stations and wind on the guides. The Backwoods rods are a cottage industry.  The company supplies parts and orders to a group of home builders who produce the rods. You ordered from a catalog, but there is little or no inventory, the rod is custom made for you."
175411,2 tone z71,2008-03-24 01:23:00,1311,thanks Garry I may try one
175463,muskymatt,2008-03-24 03:32:00,2608,  So what's your association with BW rod guys and how can you guarantee the same thing won't happen again......are you willing to assure delivery of product??  Just asking as it seems you have an educated opinion.
175467,2 tone z71,2008-03-24 03:39:00,1311,"I just came across them online searching ,thought it was cool they where built locally and are custom,I have no connections with these lads,figured someone on here must have one"
175485,Garry2Rs,2008-03-24 05:04:00,1425,"I happen to know a guy who used to post here back around 2001 - 2002.  He was one of their Pro's back then. I have been to the home of Dan Sturges, the company President, in Wasaga Beach a couple of times. I have sold my hand tied Musky Bucktail spinners to the company. I have used their rods for the past 3 or 4 years. The company principals have been to my place for drinks and snacks on at least one occasion. I am not connected to them in any way other than using their products and being happy with them. If there are delivery issues, I am not aware.  My rods arrived in a reasonable amount of time... If I wanted instant gratification I could have gone to CTC and fetched another Shimano off the shelf... I understood that My rod was being custom made... Personally, I was more than happy with the service I received, but Let The Buyer Beware. I know nothing of their recent history, my last contact was at least 24 months ago..."
215552,jace,2008-06-14 20:59:00,472,"I don't have one but i've looked at their rods recently and they use decent parts but the workmanship is  a little sub-par.  At the same time, for the price i saw on some of them, they are not bad as far as ""custom"" rods go.   The blanks I saw were all the RX7 and other batson blanks but i only saw blanks from Batson's imported lines, nothing USA made models.  The buttcaps and guides  I saw were various Batson TiCh and some even had the batson vs3 guides so they don't skimp to save money that way.  These are certainly better guides than those found on most factory shimanos.    If you're going to get one, look carefully at the overall finish work on the corks and thread wrap epoxy.  that's where the workmanship was the sloppiest.  i should add that the rods i saw were all plain jane too, no decorative thread wraps, no butt wraps, weaves or even chevrons, so I don't even know if they can do them"
544934,rodmanernie,2011-01-29 02:11:00,1,  I build all his rods anything you would like to know!
544943,uglyfish,2011-01-29 02:32:00,981,"im prostaff with backwoods rods. they are quality rods i can assure u. all the rods i use were designed by me and made to my specs. dan does his best to make sure each customer is 100% satisfied from beginning to end. and the rods, are well priced, especially for a custom made rod. the blanks are very strong and sensative and the components used in the build are very high quality. if i can find my freakin camera, ill snap some pics of my rods for u. and if ur close by, im in hamilton and i would be more then happy to meet up with anyone interested in seeing the finished product and hold one of the rods.  i have caught several fish on the rods and love them. i used to use quantum and st croix rods. since using the backwods rods i sold my other rods. i may be prostaff, so it sounds lik im just sellinga product. BUT i am a very picky person when it comes to any sporting gear i use, and i wouldnt use somethin i didnt believe it. i have caught my biggest bass on a backwoods rod and i have yet to be outfished by anyone on lake erie smallies when we're drop shotting. i firmly believe the sensativity in my rod allowed me to catch fish others were missing. i fished my backwoods rod and a new g loomis NRX rod in each hand. both rods were the same length and action. but the backwoods rod felt lighter and more comfortable in my hand.  as i said, if anyone has any questions about these rods or would like to see one, please feel free to contact me."
544945,uglyfish,2011-01-29 02:33:00,981,"  guys, ernie does FANTASTIC work on these rods!"
544948,lookinforwalleye,2011-01-29 02:37:00,4399,2 1/2 year old thread!
544956,solopaddler,2011-01-29 02:49:00,8605,    Well that explains the sloppy workmanship then!   (Just kidding Ernie!  )  Ernie has built some steelhead rods for me and a few other friends. He does great work (when he doesn't rush  ).  Some of the nicest handlework with exotic woods I've seen.
544982,Pigeontroller,2011-01-29 03:50:00,2793, Did you pay them to make you say that?
545077,uglyfish,2011-01-29 15:48:00,981,"  lol, no that was said based on my use of the rods. as i mentioned, i wouldnt stand by a product or use it if i didnt have confidence in it."
