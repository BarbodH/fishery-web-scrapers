Anyone gone through this recently. Not sure if the plate stays with the atv or if the plate stays with the owner"

He has to do the normal bill of sale and sign over the ownership to you. You just take all the appropriate paperwork to the MTO, pay for a new plate and taxes. Pretty painless I thought.  Colin"
