As it turns out, he wanted to move the shack. We travelled about 5 kms with the sled towing the shack to our prime spot from last year. It did not disappoint. 24 inch walleye, 5 or 6 lbs 45 or so perch, some very nice ones. Jigging a large silver spoon produced the big walleye and a few cigars. Photo number 2 has a blue Perch. 11inches  Terrible photos, but you'll get the idea. Thanks for looking        "
