We started off where we hammered them last time and managed 2 hammer handles in an hour and a half, so we left for greener pastures. We managed a grand total of 0 fish there in about 1/2 hour of fishing. We tried 2 more spots before finally finding the fish at spot number 5.  We started hitting fish right away but again they were small, like this fellow and smaller.    Soon the big gals started showing up and saved the day. I had a couple of baits stolen off set lines and had one fish break off on a tipup. The biggest fish we got on a set line today was about 6 or 7 pounds. The bigguns all came jigging airplane jigs tipped with 1/2 a cisco.          Tomorrow it's off to find a few troots."

548400,DRIFTER_016,2011-02-06 21:00:00,10439,  You mean the Newfie Painter?
548401,Joeytier,2011-02-06 21:01:00,3990,How much ice are you having to drill through up there?
548404,DRIFTER_016,2011-02-06 21:03:00,10439,"  About 3 feet, give or take a few inches."
548412,solopaddler,2011-02-06 21:10:00,8605,Well done buddy!  Some decent pike for sure. I bet I know exactly where the motor currently in my basement will be de-virginized.
548414,DRIFTER_016,2011-02-06 21:15:00,10439, Actually it will be de-virginized in the little lake I can see from my front deck. Gotta make sure all is well before heading across Yellowknife Bay and slogging it through the bush. It will be the second place it gets wet.
548415,solopaddler,2011-02-06 21:17:00,8605,  Well.....actually it might be the 6th or 7th place it gets wet.
