548374,SlowPoke,2011-02-06 18:59:00,2984,"Just kidding bud, the driveway was clean last night and the plow excrement was cleared up this morning. LOL on the bunnies."
548375,fishing n autograph,2011-02-06 19:20:00,2540,awesome Chris!
548381,Big Cliff,2011-02-06 19:46:00,6899,"Well I'm glad it all turned out all right but what the hell were you thinking?  Houses can be rebuilt but you risked your life trying to put that fire out and running back in there. I am really glad that you made it and lived to be called a hero but no life is worth risking for material things.  Anyway, kudos to you for doing what you did!"
548386,ChrisK,2011-02-06 20:12:00,2772,"Cliff, The reality of the situation is starting to sink in. Not sure what I was thinking but when I first stuck my head in the door all I saw was smoke and a fire place on fire. Split second decision. Let this semi detached house go up in flames and the house attached to it or do something.Theres no time for pondering in thought when this kind of thing is happening. I knew there was a calculated risk but it didn't seem to matter at that moment."
548391,solopaddler,2011-02-06 20:47:00,8605,Incredible. Nice job Chris!
548393,lew,2011-02-06 20:50:00,12766,"Atta boy Chris, ya did real good !!"
548406,Rattletrap2,2011-02-06 21:04:00,1652,"Well done Chris! I had a similar situation in my first house. The flue door was the type that you unlatched and pushed up to raise the flue door. The lever would latch and hold it at whatever position you wanted it in. I always put it wide open and double and triple checked it to be sure it was latched.  One night, I did all these things and lit a roaring god fire. I had just flopped down on the couch when I heard a bang and realized that the flue door had shut on it's own!!! The flames came straight out the front and were licking at the ceiling! I hollered for my wife and I ran out to my truck for the fire extinguisher I had in it. As i ran back inside, I just pointed it into the fireplace and started blasting the dry chemical. I was too panicked to point it at the base of the fire or anything, but miraculously, it went out! My wife had grabbed a fish that was mounted over the mantle and pulled it off the wall in time to prevent it being burned!  Fire damage was minimal, but smoke damage and the dry chemical powder was everywhere. We used large fans to draw the smoke out of the house, but it needed a thorough cleaning by professionals through our insurance company. They washed every nick nack, dishes in the cupboards, etc from basement to second floor.  I guess the intense heat caused the latch to twist or something.  Scary stuff for sure! I always have an extinguisher in the house since then."
548416,express168,2011-02-06 21:21:00,327,"Wow! that was some quick thinking, I am glad you are OK and nobody was injured ( definately get checked out if you don't feel right over the next few days). That is truly neighbours coming to one anothers help at its best.  I experienced a kitchen fire about 11 years ago, pot of grease burst into flames on the stove while unattended ( forgotten). It wicked up the cabinets and had reached the ceiling when I discovered it, I just dialed 911 grabbed the dog and got the wife out. Fire Department was there in no time but the kitchen was gutted and there was major smoke damage ( amazing what smoke does to your house and belongings). We were out of the house for 9 weeks for repairs and lost a number of personal items but we were ok and that is what insurance is for. I have always had a fire extinguisher in the house since then but if it is growing too big let it burn, it isn't worth your LIFE!  Good work, sounds like you had a good handle on this one."
548436,ChrisK,2011-02-06 21:53:00,2772,"Thanx again guys and especially from our own OFC retired firefighter Lew. I appreciate your blessings Lew seeing that you used to do this on a daily basis. I even got a few thank yous from the firefighters that came to the call. Very moving.... I guess it could of went either way but one thing for sure,if the fire was to far advanced I certainly wouldn't of went in the second time..."
548439,Cudz,2011-02-06 22:03:00,2652,Nice work.  There is a reason that London has been pelted with snow this winter. It was so you could use it to put out that fire. Think about how hard it would have been if London would have had a below average snow fall this year.
548446,Big Cliff,2011-02-06 22:27:00,6899,"Chris, I apologize if I seemed to chastize you in my reply. What you did was truly amazing! I guess it just scared me when I thought that it could have easly gone the wrong way and we could have been mourning the loss of a wonderful person from this board. You truly are a hero! I am just glad that you will be around to share some more posts with us!"
548510,ChrisK,2011-02-07 01:46:00,2772, No worries Cliff. You just brought to the surface what I had been asking myself all day since it happened. If anything its probably good therapy just talking about it.
548511,vinnimon,2011-02-07 01:59:00,2593,"Chris, you have helped your neighbour with great heroism. And  to you. Like what your sign says, what goes around comes around.  As for our area, we watch out for one another, and always helping each other out in some manner."
548254,ChrisK,2011-02-06 15:20:00,2772,"Today I was blowing out my drive when my neighbor came out of her house in her stocking feet waving her arms in the air. I shut down the blower so I could here her better. She was yelling the house was on fire,oh crap !! Sure enough there was smoke coming out the front door so I ran in to see how bad it was. The fireplace was engulfed in flames licking to the ceiling....No fire extinguisher,and no way to get water to it so I told her to hold the front door open and step back. I took a snow shovel and started shoveling snow from the front of the house in through her living room and dumped in on the fire. Seemed to be working so I continued until the flames came down and eventually went to a smolder. I  think that took about five minutes and then I could here the fire engines in the back ground...The whole time I was taking big breaths of air every time I went out for more snow because the house was totally filled with smoke. When the fire department arrived the fire was pretty much out due to the melting snow. Just thought I'd share that with you guys.....Heres a pic of one of the fire units in front of my driveway and another next door with the fire fighters....  "
548256,Spiel,2011-02-06 15:23:00,9065,"Could have been tragic no doubt, but due to your quick thinking (very clever) however the damage will likely be minimal.  I'm also glad you weren't overcome by the smoke! I'd say you've earned a Hero beer."
548258,walleye dreamer,2011-02-06 15:24:00,8,cheers to you buddy.the fishing gods owe you one
548261,Dondorfish,2011-02-06 15:26:00,1000,Well done!!  Tracker (Don)

548264,glen,2011-02-06 15:28:00,2641,Shoveling snow into a house. Sounds funny but nice work.
548265,Joey,2011-02-06 15:29:00,9122,"Wow Chris, that was very heroic, and as Spiel said, quick thinking.  You really saved your neighbour's house buddy, well done!!  Joey"

548277,Gerritt,2011-02-06 15:38:00,6129,"Great Job Chris!  However, the homeowner can expect to be out of her house for months due to smoke damage and her entire interior being gutted.  quick thinking though saved the structure! good job brother.  G"
548280,Gregoire,2011-02-06 15:41:00,1397,Good on you. I applaud you for getting up and taking action. At the very least you probably saved your neigbours some family heirlooms.
548285,BillM,2011-02-06 15:47:00,17367,"We got a hero on our hands, good job Chris!!!!!!"
548286,spincast,2011-02-06 15:48:00,3279,"Way to go Chris ! . One of employees Dad's house burned to the ground just a month ago (her first day on the job!). Same cause - fireplace. He is a widower and in his 80's.  Lost everything - photos, memories, wedding china etcs. Nothing left. Your quick thinking paid off in ways beyond just saving the house!  "

548296,SRT8 smoker craft,2011-02-06 16:02:00,1107,"  Dude you are definately a hero it's hard to keep cool in a house full of smoke .I had a total loss house fire about 6-7 years ago and I spent several minutes in the fully involved fire looking for my wife who had jumped from the second story window already. once I saw her safe outside, I went back in for my dog which had already be overwhelmed by the smoke. it has been by far the worst thing I have ever gone through physically I still am not 100% from it my sinus and lungs have given me lots of problems ever since .I had 1st degree burns on my hands and back form crawling around under the ceiling fire. glad you got it out!  .Again dude if you feel bad go to the hospital and get checked out smoke inhalation is nothing to mess with.Good job a lot of people wouldn't even consider doing what you did"
548306,ChrisK,2011-02-06 16:27:00,2772,"Thanks all for the kind words. Just to let you all know the paramedics came to my side shortly after they showed up and chatted with me asking questions like,are you short of breath and did you get close enough to the fire to inhale the fumes and such. At that point I was already back to blowing out my other neighbors driveway, so they say,guess your all right then ? I said,ya,I'm alright and yes I'm out of breath but only cause I'm fat and out of shape and I just did the equivalent to running a quarter mile"
548307,lookinforwalleye,2011-02-06 16:31:00,4399,Wow great job Chris a real OFC hero!!!  Those fireplaces can be deadly! Note to self BUY A FIRE EXTINGUISHER!
548331,Spiel,2011-02-06 17:27:00,9065,"  LMAO.... Well you are over 50 now so who cares, I believe it's acceptable, I hope. And remember, round is a shape."
548335,aplumma,2011-02-06 17:35:00,6896,Well done and quick thinking Chris. When a crisis comes it is often hard to see what ELSE is on hand to solve the problem. I hope she remembers what your favourite beer is if not remind me and I will serve you one at Lak Air.   Art
548336,ChrisK,2011-02-06 17:37:00,2772,Ya had to go and say it.....over 50  Just had a chat with the neighbor who owned the house with the fire. She said she was just getting dressed to go out shopping and would of been out of the house for a few hours.OMG !! This could of been a total disaster especially since this house is a semidetached with two older retires next door and both homes have pets... I just thank god that somehow this turned out the way it did...
548350,ChrisK,2011-02-06 17:50:00,2772,Thanx Art. Its funny how fast things happen when adrenaline takes you for a ride.   We will have a couple of beers at Lakair together for sure like all the other times and lots of storys....
548352,SlowPoke,2011-02-06 17:52:00,2984," They don't owe him anything. I'm surprised he doesn't sink in the river with all those horseshoes weighing him down!  Good on you Chris. Quick thinking and selfless action should earn you homemade pies for life!!  BTW Chris, you have a snowblower? Are you busy this afternoon?"
548353,Billy Bob,2011-02-06 17:52:00,5865,JOB WELL DONE.......  Hope you are feeling well later as smoke can do damage to the lungs...there are SOOOOOO MANY chemicals in a house fire...  Don't hesitate to be checked out at a local hospital if you don't feel right...  AGAIN....JOB WELL DONE....
548359,ChrisK,2011-02-06 18:00:00,2772," Brian, Ive done four driveways this morning. Broke one auger sheer pin and pretty sure the auger belt is on its way as well. As for them horse shoes,got rid of all those awhile back and replaced them with cute little fuzzy rabbits."
