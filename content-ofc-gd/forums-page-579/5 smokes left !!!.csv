Mine jump in the truck fire it up light a smoke OOOOOOOOOOOOps can't do that how does this thing go in to gear without a smoke. Of course eat than smoke. Unfold the newspaper and can't get the 1st paged turn without a smoke.

Its amazing what i want to say to some people right now 3 hours 18 munutes.I can make it for another minute for sure.  "
547853,irishfield,2011-02-04 22:18:00,26272,Sure you can Paul... don't use any of that as an excuse to grab a stick. Turn the answering machine on.. tell them to send you an email and you'll get right back to them and go for a walk and get some air.
547866,moxie,2011-02-04 23:23:00,1566,"WOW!!! What a great support group.  It was about 32 ago when I hauled on my first Cig. At 43 I have half heartedly tried to quit a couple of times with limited success but something that helped while trying to quit was this. The feeling of accomplishment of getting past each day without one was Quasi Euphoric because all the reasons I wanted to quit were what kept me going."" I'm doing it for my Family, my health, the extra coin in my pocket"", and with falling off the wagon came a feeling of utter failure because all I could think of were those same reasons. Find your reasons and try to honor them. Stay Strong and Good luck."

And its really just a matter of saying, no I don't need one now.  You can do it - just remember,soft water season comes soon - do you want to be steering this with your wife / friends or (think of all the gas you can buy and no difference to your bank account) : or sucking on this.... by yourself...

I dont smoke in the car, nor at my desk, since its illegal.Another trigger is when i'm working in my workshop. I am going after supper to the pharmacy to get some nicorettes gum to try and ease the shakesWhat a friggin drug !!!!!"
547892,toca,2011-02-05 00:20:00,274,yeah work stress is a killer. keep using smokes as a crutch. if you find yourself back to square one I have a book I would like to recommend to you. Its called allen carr(its been two years since ive read that book) Easy Way To Quit Smoking. Ive had friends who read this book and swear by it.

Apparently high stress and high cholesterol and smoking will in fact shorten your life. All three are under control now but having a heart doctor ask if you had a will made up was enough to convince me i didnt need to kill my self with smokes.  Good luck, lots of support here if u need it."

547950,blue pickeral,2011-02-05 09:31:00,267,"One year for me after about 30 years of a pack a day. My hints:  -if you slip the first time you quit, learn from it. Used Champix twice, first time thinking I'd wake up one day and not smoke. Next time, read directions and set a target date. Can still remember last smoke and after got rid of ash trays etc. Chew gum like crazy.  -biggest problem is filling in psychological hole in life - i.e. have a smoke while considering a task or problem, take a smoke break during completion of task, have a celebratory smoke when done. Had an awfully hard time getting started on things as a result of not having smoke to start! (As an aside, never bet on a professional sport player who has just returned to the game from rehab at least for a while.)  -didn't want to give up coffee, so switched to 'heartier' specialty stuff from Starbucks. Had extra kick.  -the urge to smoke is still there, but a lot less. (still, second hand smoke is enjoyable from time to time!)  -the dangers of smoking outweigh those of extra weight (which will come) but give yourself a few months before worrying unduly about this. Beat one thing at a time."

547976,muddler,2011-02-05 14:22:00,623,"I was a pack a day smoker for 20 years. I quit 13 years agoa when a pack cost just over $5. My fist child use due soon so it was time.  I took a shoe box and I put $5 in it every day before I went to bed. After that first year I had over $1800. I wanted to get an Angling Specialties ofset float reel and a new custom float rod. Every day I put that $5 in the box I got a little closer to my goal.  When I walked into the store a year later, I was Mr. Moneybags for about 20 minutes. I knew what I wanted and money was not an issue. Nice feeling. Geared up and went fishing the next day. Even now when I use that outfit I chuckle and think, ""I used to smoke this away"".  My kids have NEVER seen dad with a smoke.  Things that helped me a lot was to stay away from caffine loaded drinks. I switched to Diet Sprite and 7-Up.  No chocalate and I ate a lot of salads with my meals. Weight went up anyways. I tried to stay busy all the time too. I was lucky that I had a lot of friends to support me too. I found if I didn't think about it it was easier. (I know....don't think about a pink elephant). The hardest for me was the inactive time. I used to fill that up with a smoke. So I took up fly tying. Got pretty good at it too.ake all my own flies now.  Second hand smoke didn't bother me at first but now I cough constantly when I'm near any cigarette smoke.  Hang in there. Never,never ever give up!  muddler"

Just don't ever light up another smoke,  get on with your life and forget about cigarettes, it's that easy.  It's been 20 years now since I gave up those filthy stinking things cold turkey and it was the best thing I ever did.  If you keep thinking and talking about cigarettes, their gonna be on your mind constantly.  The only person who can't quit smoking is the person who doesn't really want to quit."

I want to quit, i'm pretty sure i can,but right now, its a scarey concept i havent fully grasped. oh well, i have to stay positive, and if i slip up, just keep at it. Took me 5 trys to quit the booze and that was 23 years ago, so this monkey can be beat too.  Paul"

547650,Grimace,2011-02-04 14:06:00,2020,"I remember that feeling.  Oh crap, half a pack left.  That was Feb 6th 2010.  Almost a year.  Two packs a day to nothing.  The first couple of weeks are like hell.  I had the sweats like a junky and everything.  Do not make excuses for your self.  Do not entertain the thought that it is ok to slip up.  Your lungs are going to feel great.  I can now shovel my whole driveway without a rest or even a second thought. My muscles get oxygen now instead of carbon monoxide.  Carbon monoxide and hemoglobin are a better match than oxygen and hemoglobin.  If given the choice hemoglobin will pick up carbon monoxide.  Hemoglobin transports oxygen in your blood to your muscles, but if you smoke it brings carbon monoxide, so not only are you out of breath because of tar lung your muscles are getting poisoned.  The cravings go away.  I moved a buddies car out of my way the other day and the smell inside was disgusting, my truck used to smell that way.  You can do it.  You owe yourself that much.  Excel Polar Ice.  Carrot sticks.  Water.  It has been a year for me and I went from 6'2"" 217 (not bad) to 6'2"" 235 (getting a boiler).  Next project is weight.

I am coming up for 4 years in March ... and I was a 2+ pack a day-er  Do yourself a favour ... set that half pack aside ... quit NOW .... dont throw it away ... keep it near you ... every time you want a smoke ... just remind yourself of your goal ... and ask your self how hard and painful it realllllly is right now ....most cravings only last about a minute and a half ... surely you can make it through the next minute and a half .... took me about two weeks of that kind of thinking before I realized I had stopped timing the length of those cravings ... you can do it !!!
547670,Garnet,2011-02-04 14:50:00,2056,"I feel for you. At 23 I quit because the wife laugh at me watching that quit or die commercial on TV.  The next morning didn't buy a pack on way to work, 3pm on the way home from work the 1st available store I was puffing and mad.  I found out 20-25 cups of coffee had to stop and having a couple coldies was probably not a good idea.  The next tues. AGAIN didn't buy a pack. EXACT gum and Plastic stir stick became a constant habit.  The first 2 years was awfull.  I made my self allergic to that plastic in straws and stir sticks.  For months I would look at my watch say 5 minutes or 2 minutes.  I got a verbal warning for walking away from a guy that was smoking and not dealing with his problem.  I  think what kept me at it, food was like the best sex ever and sex was better but Ham and cheese on white bread mustard mayo and slice tomato's or chess burgers it was heaven. And 126 lbs to 185 in 3-4 months.  I work in a giant factory and in the mornings when things were quiet listening to people hack was helpful.  If I was to quit today I would get everything patches, acupuncture, the gum those timer things everything.  It took 5 years to quit chewing gum.  And don't ever think you got it beat, for 20 years about 2 weeks before my tournament season I would have unbelievable nicotine fits .  After the 1st month we got sent home early witch was always a trip to some bar with my buddy's. They all new I was quitting so I was getting the gears. After about 3 beers I tied a smoke and it tasted awful I butted after 1 puff and new it was over for me I just need to go threw  2 years of hell."

It helped, don't know why but it did.  Haven't had or wanted a smoke since. In fact I can't handle being in a closed room with someone smoking now.  Watch what you eat though. I gained over 100#'s by not watching my food intake. I have dropped 66 of thos pounds so far over the last year but it sure was easier putting them on than taking them off."

547771,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2011-02-04 18:25:00,0,"congrats on your decision to quit.  it takes a lot of character to intentionally put yourself through discomfort but you will be a healthier happier person!  one of the biggest things when quitting is your attitude going in.  not to criticize, but in your original post you use terms like ""i think i can do it"" etc...  language like that has to stop.  you have to say things like ""i quit smoking today"".... ""i quit smoking 5 days ago""  Negative language only reinforces that you are leaving that door open.  My nana, who inspired me to quit after she smoked for 50 years, told me that the day you quit, you will.  The day you try, you won't.  Good luck, not that you need it!"

The hard part was gaining the weight I put on around 35 pounds but I have gotten rid of about 20 of that.  If you really want to quit I would suggest Champix it worked miracles for me,I would not have ever been able to quit with out it.  Good luck too you!!!"
