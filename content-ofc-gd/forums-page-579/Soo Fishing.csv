They live in the Soo and the warden has advised I should expect to be there for 4 - 5 days, but am allowed out for a one day excursion while she does the local visits and organisation. Any suugestions from some of our members up that way? I noticed this one showed up in a sponsor link - anybody tried this or know what it is like? Kawagama Lake  I fished Superior Provincial Park before and had mixed luck with the brookies. Any suggestions welcome. Trout, Walleye, Northerns?  Guess I should mention - Mid July is the timing.."
