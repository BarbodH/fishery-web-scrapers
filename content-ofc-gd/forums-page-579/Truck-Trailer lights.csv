My Xterra has the 7 pin trailer connector and I'm hooking up my 4 pin trailer. I have everything in place, but I'm not getting any left brake or left turn signal.. Everything else works great.  I've tried it with my dads truck who has just a 4 pin connector and all the lights work normally..  So I'm thinking it has to be my truck.. but where ?? This is a direct install from Nissan wiring and all.  So where can I look and start to test.. Any help would be very very appreciated.  Thanks, Tiz"
548417,DRIFTER_016,2011-02-06 21:22:00,10439, Are you using a 7 pin to 4 pin adapter?  Here's a diagram of the 7 pin wiring. Trouble shooting is as easy as testing the pins with a test light.    7 pin to 4 pin adapter.  
548418,Roy,2011-02-06 21:25:00,13728,"Tiz, I don't think it's even worth the effort. I have 7 pins off the truck and 4 pins to the trailer. Had a problem last year, went to a trailer dude, he fixed it up, took him less that 10 minutes, charged me nothing. I asked what it was so I'd know for the next time and in my case, all it was was that my truck has a different wiring sequence to the trailer."
