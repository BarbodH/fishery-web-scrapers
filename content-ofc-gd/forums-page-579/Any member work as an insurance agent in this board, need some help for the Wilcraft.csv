Also I know some people using as a fishing boat during summer time. I have been posting in this forum for getting a help to get insurance but in Ontario, seems no insurance company is interested to insurance this machine if they do, they charge more than $1000 per year,they giving you the excuse once you getting onto the water and it is not cover, or once you get onto the ice , and it is not cover. Some said once you get onto the land, it is not cover. They don't even care the Wilcraft use it as a recue vehicle in the State. If our members in that board works as an insurance agent, we may get some help from them!  Thanks in advance!"
