547708,Billy Bob,2011-02-04 16:33:00,5865,Actually I would rather have them move up to Toronto and save us taxpayers some money down the road....but no such luck...  http://www.buffalonews.com/sports/sabres-nhl/article331944.ece
547714,Grimace,2011-02-04 16:38:00,2020,Toronto would do good with an NFL franchise.  We should have our own franchise not Buffalo's.  Why would we want the Bills?  There are enough terrible teams up here.
547715,misfish,2011-02-04 16:41:00,29133,We didnt want them any ways.
547722,Roy,2011-02-04 16:45:00,13728,Don't send them to Montreal then....we have enough bills.
547738,asdve23rveavwa,2011-02-04 17:15:00,2690,"Too bad, I'd love to see the NFL up here!!!  Our league with it's ridiculous amount of teams, and, three downs can RIP for all I care...does that sound a little harsh"
547748,fishing n autograph,2011-02-04 17:31:00,2540,the league's heirarchy would never allow a Canadian franchise.....even if the bills were to come up here it would be shot down
547749,Spiel,2011-02-04 17:34:00,9065,  I wish Hamilton City council (Ont) thought like you do.
547777,lookinforwalleye,2011-02-04 18:36:00,4399,Darn Toronto could have used another loosing team!!!
547786,Billy Bob,2011-02-04 18:52:00,5865," They have given Ralph Wilson EVERYTHING he has asked for.....new staduim carpet...the BEST...more box seats...more club level seats....heated seat areas....Named the field Ralph Wilson Stadium....Built him a field house...Named the Field House after him....New Score Board....you name it he got it.....I just wish they would name the new Peace Bridge ""The Ralph Wilson Golden Gate Peace Bridge"" and then they would BUILD IT...."
547789,asdve23rveavwa,2011-02-04 18:54:00,2690," OUCH,"
547797,Raf,2011-02-04 19:17:00,3495,cliff notes?
547817,kickingfrog,2011-02-04 20:31:00,8333," Lots of hot air, but no substance.  That goes for both by-the-way."
547834,Dutchy,2011-02-04 21:41:00,416, I'm glad they are staying. Was down there for the Steelers game in November and the atmosphere at Ralph Wilson Stadium was fantastic. I'll be going to at least one game every year.
547940,hawk-eye,2011-02-05 03:52:00,141,There was no chance the Bills were going to move here. Having them play some games up here was a way to test out the market. If any team is comming here in the next 10 years it would most likely be Jacksonville.
