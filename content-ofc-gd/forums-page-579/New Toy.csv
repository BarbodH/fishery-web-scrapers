548457,Gregoire,2011-02-06 22:44:00,1397,"A couple of weeks ago I came in to some extra cash (thanks to my fantasy football genius) and I decided to use some of my winnings to purchase a new reel. I started a post and decided to get the Pflueger Patriarch 9525 for two reasons:  1. I wanted to use it for ice fishing 2. I fish some clear and busy water and wanted to be able to use an extreme finesse presentation  I decided that I would purchase the reel from LeBaron as they had a good price on the reel and I would get the 10% rebate. When I go to the Markham store and asked they did not have any Patriarchs in stock. I then asked to see the Shimano Stradis CI4 microline, and it turned out they don't carry that reel. On to plan B. I called bass pro, and they had none in stock. Plan C I called LeBaron Missisuaga, none. Restocking would be in mid march, so on to plan D, order online. I ended up getting the reel on ebay shipped from Thailand for a little less than it would have been in stores in Canada (196 all in). With the savings I was able to order an Abu Garcia hip bag, which will be nice to use while shore fishing.  The reel was delivered a week and a half after the order, extremely good delivery time I thought. I got a chance to pick it up yesterday.  The reel out of the box:    The box:    Thai writing on the box and warranty card     A close up of the spools and handle      A few questions: Why are the holographic stickers with the serial numbers stickers marked Abu Garcia? (I know that both Pflueger and Abu Garcia are owned by Pure Fishing.)     And what is this sticker for:     I was thinking that I would load up the ultra light spool with 5 ld braid and use that in the summer. I am planning on using the spare aluminum spool for ice fishing. Any recommendations for line on this spool. I was thinking a heavier ice braid as I would like to target lakers. Do I need to add tape/backing to the good spool to spool it with braid?  Thanks for reading and any input or advice that you can give.  Greg"
548459,2advanced,2011-02-06 22:49:00,53,The sticker is used to protect the magnesium body from being scratched when you mount it in your rod
548460,Gregoire,2011-02-06 22:53:00,1397, So...where would I apply said sticker?
548461,mercman,2011-02-06 22:54:00,7054,Nice !!! I have a Patriarch also.Nice smooth strong reel.I teamed mine with a Fennwick HMG 6'm/f and its a great tool.
548464,Gregoire,2011-02-06 23:08:00,1397, I'd like to pair it with a really light 7 foot or so light rod. I'd love to make it a cumulus or a G loomis but those seem a bit pricey. There seems to be a compre that works. I'm going to have to try the reel on a bunch of rods.
548468,ohhenrygsr,2011-02-06 23:18:00,947,"Nice pflueger. As a tourney fisherman it's hard to budget cause you want equipment to be reliable and cheap lol. Yes that's hard to find. I really like my plueger supremes and president reels. You will love the patriarch series, very jealous lol."
548479,s2k4mee,2011-02-07 00:08:00,73,place the sticker on the reel foot (under side where the 2 stickers are located) then fold the edges over to protect the finish =)
548480,2advanced,2011-02-07 00:09:00,53,You apply it on the reels foot
548481,Gregoire,2011-02-07 00:12:00,1397,Thanks guys
