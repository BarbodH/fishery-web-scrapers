547951,blue pickeral,2011-02-05 09:44:00,267," Sour grapes perhaps but - we left Yellowknife/NWT in 1997 after five years of minus 40 setting in just before Christmas, staying that way until it warmed up to -20 in March (and everyone went around with their parkas open to enjoy the warmth) then when it went up to -10 or so in May, it was time to get a few outdoor things done.  I used to curse Whitehorse for the good temps over there, but looks like the last few years in Yellowknife has been pretty good as well! (sorry to hear Caribou Carnival is in doubt this year...)"
