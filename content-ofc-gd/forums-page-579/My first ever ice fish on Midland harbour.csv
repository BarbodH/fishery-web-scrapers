Man it was like a scene from grumpie old men.LOL    I thought these guys being local would of had huts but nope,so I ended up standing out in the open,but no pro with -1 temps. This guy had a nice set up.    I marked alot of fish.(probly mostly herring,lines were zipping averywhere) Smacked a very small herring on a half and half,and bumped another fish,but to no avail,no fish.  I have to thank Crappieperchhunter for my new addition.Works great Steve. Even picks up the lure and swivel.Awesome.     Thats probly my last outing for sometime,,,,,,,,,,,,,"

548456,misfish,2011-02-06 22:43:00,29133," Theres, herring and whities and pike and the odd eye ,so I was told, by an older local that was out there.Had a great chat with him. He,s been fishing that area many a years."

548471,BillM,2011-02-06 23:23:00,17367,"Brian, is there a herring season on Gbay?  I'd just keep them for quick strike rigs in the spring, lol."
548517,irishfield,2011-02-07 02:20:00,26272,Thanks for the call bud!.. fishing in my back yard. BTW.. they only fish there because it's a short distance to stagger back to the parking lot...  Bill... you'd want a hungry pike for these lads..and yes you can keep them. (open all year s25/c12)  
548518,Phranchise,2011-02-07 02:30:00,10,"Grumpy old men eh, did anyone get their hut pulled around by a truck? Ha. Nice report!"
