So i have looked at the boating regulations and it appears as though any boat up to 19'8 in length is required to have a re boarding ladder. But when i think about it, basically not a single 14 foot tinner that I know of has a reboarding ladder on it...can someone please clarify what the rules are in relation to this? Is it just that its not often enforced, or is it actually a requirement? Is every single small tinner out there in violation of the rules? Ive got an 18 foot bass boat and a 14 foot tinner, neither of them have ladders on them...am i going to get in trouble the next time i run into the OPP?"
1028733,G.mech,2018-05-23 20:51:00,830,A reboarding device is required if the freeboard is greater than o.5 m.  It has nothing to do with the length.  This snippit shows Note 1 on Page 19 of the Safe Boating Guide: https://www.tc.gc.ca/media/documents/marinesafety/TP-511e.pdf

If my understanding is correct, the lowest point of the boat cannot be above .5m of the waterline, and in the case of my skeeter and my tinner the back of the boat barely sits above water. Therefore no ladder needed."
