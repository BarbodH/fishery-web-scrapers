We had a 8 year old 12 year old and even a 13 year old successfully ski for the first time. It was a bit of a challenge for the 13 year old to get up but on around his 6 th try or so he was up skiing around the lake. We had the kids crouching in shallow water at the shoreline while a friend kept their tips up. So there you have it...kids can waterski behind a 8 hp! Good times."

Decide to go waterskiing, NOT me I’ll drive, could not get this guy “up”.  Front end just raised lol went by the dock and he asks his wife if she would sit up front for ‘dead weight’. BY NO means she was a heavy not even close, not even close. It was a tense moment. Never got him up! Lol "
1028755,BillM,2018-05-24 13:55:00,17367,We used to wakeboard behind a 14ft with a 9.9.   It's definitely doable just takes a bit to get up.
1028767,GBW,2018-05-24 19:18:00,8460,"Yup, I did as a kid.  Even surfed on those big styrofoam surfboards into my teens being pulled by a 7.7"
1028780,Rizzo,2018-05-25 01:19:00,4754,a 7.7! you have outdone me 
1028802,GBW,2018-05-25 16:17:00,8460,"I'm old, 8's weren't out then.  The kneeboard and big surfboards will last for years behind the 8hp"
