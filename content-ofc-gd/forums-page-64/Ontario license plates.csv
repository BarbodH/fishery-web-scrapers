1024085,Old Ironmaker,2018-03-06 21:21:00,8243,"What about your gun Ohio? When I was a kid I could tell when and if the plates were issued in Hamilton based on the letters and numbers, still can, that skill and 2 bucks will get you a Horton's coffee. Actually it started a few nice conversations down in Florida or in far off places in Ontario like Oakville. The Hamilton Police must have gotten new plates all at the same time. The old beater undercover cop cars in the 70's all had nice shiny new plates on them in sequence and we could see them coming from a block away. I mentioned that to a buddy that joined the force, he told the Chief, they must have been impressed because 30 years latter he became Chief of Police in Hamilton."
1024093,OhioFisherman,2018-03-06 23:01:00,6623,"No guns at work old, a knife was a tool, cutting plastic banding and shrink wrap if you had to hand unload stuff of the back of the truck."
1024100,Old Ironmaker,2018-03-07 02:22:00,8243,"I get it Ohio, was being facetious. When I was on a visit to a Steel plant in Gary Indiana in the 80's the Shift Foreman I was with carried a weapon, many workers did. After being there for 2 days I clearly understood why. No one expects that when you walk around a plant and turn a corner in the dead of night you will be met by thugs that will rob you of anything you have on you, anything. We here  Canada just don't see or understand the underbelly of some, and I repeat some places not just in the USA."
1024146,camillj,2018-03-07 17:32:00,1988,Pretty sure I paid a bundle and had to wait a few weeks (personalized so its my own fault) ... but hey who wants ugly old peeling plates on a new truck   DIG4GLD in case you were wondering
1028876,chris.brock,2018-05-28 14:09:00,4053,"My wife got a $110 ticket a couple days ago for obstruction of plate because of her peeling plates, lol. A poorly made, peeling licence plate isn't the same as an obstructed plate, pretty asinine cop, I wasn't in the car "
1028908,huzzsaba,2018-05-28 19:36:00,884,"That sucks.  Can't she fight it? since its not her fault?  I'm guessing this was in Halton.  Halton Police are not as forgiving as Peel police. Im guessing if you were in the car, it would have turned out differently.  Hope the charges can be dropped"
1028930,chris.brock,2018-05-29 02:56:00,4053,"Yes, Halton. I'm pretty sure we can get it quashed it's just a PITA and a waste of time. If it goes to trial it will be a waste of tax payers $. It should have been a warning to get new plates. My 3 year old son was in the car and he quite liked the experience of getting pulled over by the police and being issued a ticket, lol."
1023299,huzzsaba,2018-02-21 21:58:00,884,I'm sure a lot of you are in the same boat as me with peeling license plate.  I have used the plastic covers and despite that still have the issue.  .  I get jealous when I see the older style plates or any plates from outside the province.  My only choice now to get new plates or is there a way to get free replacement plates??  Thanks 
1023300,ketchenany,2018-02-21 22:11:00,3229,"When this came up last year on a news report, the “government” said the plates were guaranteed for five years (where was stated when we bought the plates) You are on the hook for new plates at full cost after five years. Ontario’s plates are an embarrassment! Here and outside the province. I spent many hours working on that Ontario logo only to be attached to garbage that we paid for and no responsibility by the firm that made them. Mine were about to go and I coated them with polyurethane, probably three coats it helped. "
1023301,huzzsaba,2018-02-21 22:14:00,884,Mine are definitely past the 5 year mark. Probably my only option is to use a mint set of plates from my old car and transfer them on to my existing car. Not sure if its cheaper that route or just get new plates. 
1023302,ketchenany,2018-02-21 22:27:00,3229,"I was wondering the same thing, I have lots of them lol. "
1023304,SirCranksalot,2018-02-21 23:02:00,3291,They replaced my old ones for free and they were more than 5 years old.
1023307,Raf,2018-02-21 23:51:00,3495,there is a range of plates (ie. BAxx - BFZZ) that they will replace regardless of age.  i don't know the exact range.
1023310,chris.brock,2018-02-22 01:08:00,4053,"My wifes is a BK..... and has pretty well all peeled off. It kinda detracts from her nice, newer vehicle but I make her keep it for the for the 407 perks."
1023311,LostAnotherOne,2018-02-22 01:19:00,956,Half of mine has been peeled off for a couple years now.  I dont know how much to replace but its probably ridiculous.  When it  comes to the sticker and license renewal prices i dont know what worse walking into a service Ontario place or going to my doctors to get a colonoscopy exam.
1023314,GBW,2018-02-22 03:32:00,8460,"If not free to replace, blue marker/nail polish and packing tape to reduce your costs.  Then OPP and local can make out the markers on the plate.  Legal?  No clue but might be better than not..."
1023315,Woodsman,2018-02-22 04:43:00,1286,GBW not legal.
1023320,Bondar,2018-02-22 09:05:00,817,"Mine were replaced for free and were 8 years old . No questions,  walked in and asked walked outside and unscrewed them and exchanged for new ones"
1023322,dave524,2018-02-22 12:24:00,4508,"For years the plates were made of Dofasco Hot Dip Galvanized steel, prepainted  white and occasionally other colours long ago at Baycoat in Hamilton . About 2000 we lost the business and since then the plates have never been the same. Operating a crane I listened to the truck drivers explain how Millbrook Correctional had 2 gates and how they inspected the truck going in and out in the area between the gates, later I was a slitter operator and I slit the wide prepainted coils to plate width and I assume they were finally stamped out and numbers painted at Millbrook.  edit: guess we lost the business because Google says they closed Millbrook in 2003"
1023333,OhioFisherman,2018-02-22 16:11:00,6623,"I drove a truck here stateside, only delivered to a couple of area prisons, but it was pretty much the same procedure. My pocket knife had to be left at the gate until I left."
1023393,GBW,2018-02-23 03:53:00,8460,Thanks as I wasn't sure at all as one can't take google as true.  I think I may just go change a fact on Wikipedia cause I can...
1023422,Old Ironmaker,2018-02-23 17:35:00,8243,"The killer is if the plates can't be read through no fault of your own you can get a ticket for illegible plates. You can get a ticket if you put them in the blueish plastic covers they sell that change the colour. I had a set that peeled after a few years, replaced for no charge. I was also told 5 years and newer will be replaced at no charge."
1023444,pics,2018-02-23 20:35:00,1268,I just got a new truck and I put my old plates on it.. They are the 6 digit ones with black paint and they still look good.. .
1023460,Carp,2018-02-23 22:44:00,1488,Returned my peeling plates a few months ago. They were only 3 yrs. old. No charge !
1023466,moxie,2018-02-24 01:21:00,1566,The plates on my truck have no skin what so ever.. One of Durhams finest pulled my wife over last week and warned her that shed be handed a ticket one of these times if they werent replaced. Mine are well past 5 years and don't plan to pay for something that used to last decades. Par for the course with the band of idiots running Queens Park. I just take a sharpie to it from time to time.
1023509,chrisb,2018-02-25 02:20:00,24,I fixed my very old trailer plate with blue tremclad. The colour match is so close you can't tell.  But I also know several people who got peeling auto plates replaced free.
1023540,SirCranksalot,2018-02-25 19:27:00,3291,I put blue masking tape on mine until I could get them replaced.
1023547,Whitespinnerbait,2018-02-25 22:29:00,2038,how much does it cost to get the peeling plates replaced .?
1023552,Raf,2018-02-25 23:35:00,3495,"grand total of free if less than 5 years old if it starts with a b, more than likely same grand total even if it's older than 5 years otherwise i think it's around $50"
1023583,cuzza,2018-02-26 14:35:00,467,"I had some 9year old plates replaced a few weeks ago for nothing, they were BH's"
1023620,huzzsaba,2018-02-26 21:09:00,884, I know what I am doing this Thursday!  Going to try my luck at getting some new plates for free! Mine are BM plates.
1024083,huzzsaba,2018-03-06 20:26:00,884,"Update:  walked into sheridan mall Service Ontario with my ugly BMHH plates, and walked out 15 minutes later with a set of brand new plates for a grand total of zero!  The teller looked at the plates, made a face, and threw them in a box along with a whole bunch of other junk plates.  No questions asked!"
