Thanks"

1028732,huzzsaba,2018-05-23 20:39:00,884,"could be switch or the coil.   Previously with the regular coil stoves, I have always just replaced the coil when it went out and that seems to fix it, but these glasstop seem to be more complex."
1028734,Tom S,2018-05-23 21:01:00,362,"Yeah, I'm not sure how serviceable those stoves are. Do you have a multimeter? If so, disconnect and check the resistance of the coils. From what I can read you should be seeing 20-40 ohms, infinite resistance would indicate a burned-out coil."
1028739,huzzsaba,2018-05-23 22:01:00,884,thanks for the reply.  I don't have a multi-meter but will see if I can borrow one.

Got a gas stove and haven’t even noticed the difference in my gas consumption, fast and cheap. maybe look into it. I know it’s an expense but I tell you gas you can’t beat it for cooking. Will pay for itself .  "
1028748,desship,2018-05-24 11:01:00,96,Our stove  did the same thing.Replaced control knob and it works fine. Easy fix if its only the switch on stove .
1028749,Raycaster,2018-05-24 11:43:00,528,"Had a Pyrex measuring glass fall from a overhead cupboard and break right thru the glass top revealing the burner element. Had an extended warranty at Home Depot that informed me I was SOL. The glass top contained all elements as 1 unit $400, installed myself avoiding the $200 service fee. Did I mention the stove was 3 months old?"
