917613,Spiel,2015-05-30 00:33:00,9065,Most sad.
917954,Moosebunk,2015-06-01 00:52:00,3970,"The initial story of him missing still seems like yesterday.  Most of us read it here.  Today does not seem like four years later, but to his family we can only imagine it felt like 40.  Good the family can now lift from it's shoulders one heaviest burden of mystery and lay much more than just Daniel to rest."

917396,lew,2015-05-28 15:39:00,12766,It'll be good for the family to finally have closure on this TJ
917398,misfish,2015-05-28 15:41:00,29133,Yes Lew. That's the best thing out of this.

917400,NAW,2015-05-28 15:48:00,4022,That's great That his family can get some closure.

917403,Terry,2015-05-28 15:57:00,14456,felt bad for the family not knowing all that time closure is a good thing
917406,solopaddler,2015-05-28 16:28:00,8605,"Thank you for posting, my heart goes out to the family. Very glad they have closure."
917407,AKRISONER,2015-05-28 16:35:00,5558,Im interested to see if they will ever explain what happened to him. If they can still tell from the remains or not. I am glad to hear his family has finally gotten the closure they needed.
917409,Joey,2015-05-28 17:03:00,9122,"Well as everyone has said, at least the family has closure now.  Still a very sad outcome"
917413,BillM,2015-05-28 17:17:00,17367,Closure is a good thing.
917415,adempsey,2015-05-28 17:27:00,1498,I can't imagine what that was like for the family.   Finally they can make peace with it.
917418,Walleye72,2015-05-28 17:45:00,156,"Yes, closure for the family will be a good thing.  I wonder if finding him will produce any clues as to what happened to him other than just succumbing to the harsh reality of a Northern Ontario winter?"
917419,manitoubass2,2015-05-28 17:54:00,11391,Sad to hear about the loss.  No idea who he was but i feel for him and his family?
917433,Steelheadphycho,2015-05-28 18:33:00,470,"Exhale...........  I used to imagine that Daniel was doing exactly what he wanted. His dream to live among the wild. of course, I didn't drift too far from the reality of his likely fate but, it was cool to think that this person could be doing what so many dream of. No cell phone. No job. No bills. No drama. Existence only known to God.  Rest in peace Daniel  And may the peace of closure come to the Trask family  Thank you for posting TJ"
917435,Beavertail,2015-05-28 18:45:00,331,"Really feel for the family, can't imagine what they've been through and glad it's finally coming to an end. This story kind of reminds me of a book I read, ""Into the Wild"". True story and unfortunately things didn't end well for that young man either."
917438,ratherboutdoors,2015-05-28 18:59:00,132,Thank you for the update. Well said Mr. Steelheadphycho.
917476,Sinker,2015-05-28 23:35:00,8692,That sums up my thoughts quite nicely.  Im glad the family finally has closure. They didnt give up hope all those years. Ii followed it from the start.  S.

917479,Musky or Specks,2015-05-28 23:52:00,2710,"Thank goodness the family finally has some closure. So far they feel that he succumbed to exposure after a fall   http://www.nugget.ca/2015/05/28/remains-of-missing-kitchener-man-found  Maureen Trask was never going to quit looking for her son. She knew the outcome wouldn't be good, but that didn't matter. She wanted his remains. She wanted to bring him home. Trask said her son's skull was found by the Michigan Backcountry Search and Rescue Volunteer team Sunday near the east shore of Lady Evelyn near Walsh Lake. The remains were sent by Ontario Provincial Police to the North East Region Forensic Pathology Unit for examination and have been positively identified as Daniel Robert Trask of Kitchener. “This was what we were here to find,” Trask told The Nugget in a telephone interview Thursday afternoon from Lady Evelyn. “We suspect he fell and suffered a fracture, but the cause of death is still inconclusive.” Trask said a rib bone was found yesterday, however it's unclear if the bone is human or animal. “The bone is being sent away to be tested,” she said. “We're just guessing right now. We can only anticipate what Daniel did his last day.” Trask said the Michigan Backcountry Search and Rescue are assisting the Ontario Provincial Police in the search for more of Daniel's remains and other clothing. She said the search is happening both in the water and on land. Daniel Trask was reported missing in November 2011. His car was found on Red Squirrel Road near Camp Wanapitei at Ferguson Bay after he was reported missing. At the time of his disappearance he was 28-years-old. The discovery was found during an extensive search organized by the family. Search teams arrived May 21 and were expecting to remain in the Temagami area until May 31. The Trask family also arranged for two certified cadaver dogs from the Ottawa Valley SAR Dog Association to be up there for three days. In 2013, the Michigan Backcountry Search and Rescue Volunteer team had located Daniel's backpack. It was found about five kilometers north of where his winter jacket and snow pants were found in May 2012. The Trask family have organized countless trips to Temagami to find Daniel. Daniel, who also went by Dan or Danny, spent his summers canoeing in Temagami and returned to the area for the Changing of the Seasons, a native celebration."
917485,sneak_e_pete,2015-05-29 01:05:00,540,"I think it is an amazing story with such a sad ending.  A lot of us dream of doing what he did...but he did it.  What a brave young man.  A reminder that the north is not an easy place to be and that doing something like he did is serious business.  I respect him very much for his goal, but am saddened that his family had this loss.  R.I.P"
917518,Old Ironmaker,2015-05-29 15:41:00,8243,Our thoughts and prayers are with the Trask family. Since reading about this story a few years ago here on OFC I have tried to follow it throughout these past years. The strength and determination showed by Mr. and Mrs. Trask is the kind of story that make the NY Times best sellers list and a Hollywood movie. I would be amazed if this tragedy and inspirational story of the Trask family and all the determined volunteers doesn't make it to the big screen some day.
917556,NAW,2015-05-29 19:26:00,4022," The Trask family also arranged for two certified cadaver dogs from the Ottawa Valley SAR Dog Association to be up there for three days.   The Volunteers in the Ottawa Valley SAR Dog Association, and the Michigan Back Country SAR are amazing.  I've worked with them many times in the past, and it doesn't surprise me that they where the ones to find his remains. These people dedicate their entire lives to training these dogs to do exactly this.  Find remains, and help grieving families.  Kudos to them, for taking time out of their normal lives to go help search for Daniel, and actually getting the results they where looking for.  I'm sure the K9 handlers/Searchers after searching for 10 days, could barely walk after.  It's not an easy job, and they don't get paid a cent for it."
