1028829,captpierre,2018-05-26 22:22:00,2521,"Need to take my 2007 115F outboard in for some routine maintenance.  Timing belt. Impeller. Fuel filter etc  whatever is needed I’m in the Buckhorn area.  I see there are 3 dealers fairly close. Buckeye, Walsten, and Paris. Anybody know of a good and fair service centre to take her to?  Thanks Peter "
1028846,Sinker,2018-05-27 15:30:00,8692,"Buckeye is your best bet in bobcaygeon. There is also DT powersports, and Tucker marine in Apsley.  I'm not sure if Hastings marine is doing any service work any more but they were always good to me.  S."
1028849,KawarthaGuy,2018-05-27 19:57:00,46,"Hey Capt, I'm interested in this as well as Hastings has closed up and Dunford's not what they used to be. Kawartha Guy "
1028850,Raf,2018-05-27 20:05:00,3495,A bit out of your way but gordon bay marine would be my suggestion.  5 star Yamaha service Its too bad about hastings as i found them good as well
1028851,chris.brock,2018-05-27 21:26:00,4053,Walsten south of Kinmount has a decent reputation.
1028869,fishindevil,2018-05-28 13:31:00,6254,walsten marine in kinmount has serviced my Yamaha and they are great to deal with and I have never had a problem there...I recommend them for sure
1028870,fishindevil,2018-05-28 13:32:00,6254,sorry they are in norland not kinmount
