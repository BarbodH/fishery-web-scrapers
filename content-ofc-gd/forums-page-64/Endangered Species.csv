1028968,dave524,2018-05-30 00:42:00,4508,"Stepdaughter caught a nice eel down by the lighthouse at DalHousie, she let it go. It's bigger then any I've ever got, last one i got was at the mouth of the Forty here over 20 years ago,   "
1028969,HTHM,2018-05-30 00:43:00,4082,I am envious! Nice catch.
1028971,Raf,2018-05-30 01:22:00,3495,Cool.   I hope they make a comeback used to catch them regularly at BoQ some 20-30 years ao
1028972,Rizzo,2018-05-30 01:23:00,4754,Wow that is one creepy looking best. Congrats on the bizarre catch
1028974,OhioFisherman,2018-05-30 01:58:00,6623,"Cool! When I was like 16 I caught some little ones that looked like that while netting minnows for bait in a trib of Lake Erie, that was the only time I had seen one around here."
1028981,Garnet,2018-05-30 10:58:00,2056,Here they are endangered. This one will makes it's way back to the Adradic Sea to spawn. Roughly from Mexico to Portugal . The whales eat millions of them. And are like crack cocaine to Stripe bass. Sold in every bait shop.
1028987,AKRISONER,2018-05-30 13:12:00,5558,consider reporting this to the MNR...they rely on folks like us to let them know what is going on.  https://www.ontario.ca/page/report-rare-species-animals-and-plants
1028989,chris.brock,2018-05-30 13:32:00,4053,"That's a big one! I am surprised they could keep hold of it. A guy I know used to get them in Niagara on the Lake. They would tie a cows head from the butcher to a rope and toss it in, lol."
1028990,dave524,2018-05-30 13:42:00,4508,"it is reported , they got a smaller one there last year too."
1029023,LeXXington,2018-05-30 19:49:00,1928,wow nice!
1029034,Old Ironmaker,2018-05-30 21:48:00,8243,I ate Eel once in Japan. I thought it was Lake Erie Perch!
1029043,Snidley,2018-05-30 23:23:00,620,Guys make tens of thousands of dollars down east and in Maine harvesting the small baby eel before they go to sea and they then sell the babies to the Japanese who raise them to a viable commecial size to then be sold to Japanese foodies as a delicacy. Obviously the market has been ruined for thhem here since we fished them out.
1029044,John Bacon,2018-05-31 00:22:00,3277,"They spawn in the Sargasso Sea. Actually, the baby eels would be heading out of the sea into fresh water.  They spawn in the Sargasso Sea and then head into the inland waters to grow to adulthood before returning to the sea to spawn.  	I don't think they've been fished out here.  But all of the dams and locks in our water ways is making it more difficult for them to migrate back and forth from the sea."
1029051,HTHM,2018-05-31 02:12:00,4082,If you have ever had smoked eel you know what the best taste in the world is.
1029056,Garnet,2018-05-31 10:21:00,2056,So this ell will go back out the St Lawrance hang a right go to the Saragosse sea roughly from Mexico to Portugal and spawn. They trap netted 1 in Simcoe a few years ago. Amazing stuff. All along the east coast 12-18 ells are used for bait for Striped Bass.
1029058,gaspumper,2018-05-31 11:15:00,393,"We caught 2 last year at BOQ  reported the first one to mnr, called the number listed in ths reg guide and they didn't give a rats ass about it."
1029067,jimmer,2018-05-31 13:47:00,2730,"Thank you for sharing. It's always nice to see the unusual catches.  My father used to tell me stories about growing up in Toronto and swimming down at Sunnyside (Probably the late 20's and early 30's), diving off the concrete piers with hands open and catching eels because there were so many of them."
