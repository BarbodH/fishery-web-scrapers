We marked fish but no hits so, we were wondering if anybody here would be willing to share on PM some tips for rookies We're planning on going out again tomorrow morning. Much appreciated!"

My starting strategy for Lakers is the same no matter what lake I'm on, basically inland lakes, biggest water would be Kipawa. Nothing like lake O or Simcoe, which I've never fished.  Even then I don't tend to troll ""big open water"". I like to find structure close to deep water, whether points large and small, islands, and midlake shoals, weather and boat size permitting.   Bonus if you find baitfish schools  associated with these structures. Even better if you can find a pattern, like on a certain side of structures. Once the thermocline sets up well then a whole different strategy becomes available for open water trolling, but that would be for more local guys for intel on that. Good luck out there next time. Cheers   "
