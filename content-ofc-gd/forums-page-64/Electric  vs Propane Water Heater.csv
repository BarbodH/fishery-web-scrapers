1028603,FLEX ROD,2018-05-20 11:10:00,394,"Once again I am reaching out to this great group of knowledge, as some may remember I am building a house in the Eugenia area and its time to finish my plumbing. As I have no knowledge of propane vs electricity water heaters I am looking for some feedback, I was surprised that propane tanks are special order at all stores, even the ones out side of the city, but also the fact that a propane one is about 3 times the cost. Does going with a propane unit justify itself in the long run? The basement in the house has been designed to be a rental property so it will have a separate water heater so the cost difference is quite large approximately 3 times per unit, which is a fair bit so any and all info is greatly appreciated. Thanks, FLEX "
1028607,ketchenany,2018-05-20 12:59:00,3229,Have you looked into tankless heaters. Not sure if they run on propane.
1028610,lew,2018-05-20 13:40:00,12766,"Yes they do, I have one and it's excellent."
1028614,Mister G,2018-05-20 15:45:00,1429,"Are you going to have propane for other items like kitchen stove or whatever. If not I wouldn't bother going with propane, however if you lose electric in that area a lot you could run out of hot water but if you have a well pump it would not matter."
1028616,OhioFisherman,2018-05-20 16:23:00,6623,"I live in a rural area here stateside, electric and propane were all that was available I recall as options for us. My home is all electric and my electric power is thru a multi county electric co-op. You might check with your electric supplier in your area and see if they offer rebate programs such as these? http://www.lmre.org/content/water-heaters A gas or propane water heater probably need a chimney of sorts? a higher risk of CO2 problems?"
1028617,John Bacon,2018-05-20 16:25:00,3277,"Most of the modern natural gas heaters are power vented and have electronic ignition; so they need electricity to run.  I suspect that the propane ones are the same.  	However, a generator should be able to provide enough power for the ignition and venting."
1028618,Old Man,2018-05-20 16:27:00,822,"Check out Navien tankless heaters. I have the boiler and domestic hot water combo in my house and it’s been great. Expensive to buy, but cheap to run. "
1028622,DRIFTER_016,2018-05-20 17:22:00,10439,They do. Going to put a Rheem in my cabin.
1028640,Old Ironmaker,2018-05-21 17:18:00,8243,Operating costs for propane are less than hydro. The best ROI is On Demand propane hot water. If renting a unit (gas or electric) is possible in your area I would consider it depending on monthly cost. You never need worry about break downs and repair costs.
1028770,Sinker,2018-05-24 20:08:00,8692,"Propane water on demand is how I would go. You use less propane, and they work great.  S."
1028772,Terry,2018-05-24 21:00:00,14456,Do  tankless heaters still have issues with hard water 
1028773,Lord Letto,2018-05-24 21:38:00,70,"we had a Electric Tank-less heater here with a electric tank backup, it wasn't very good (Granted it was a old unit), the Landlord ended up swapping to a Natural Gas tank, much better! As a Bonus, we don't pay as much for hydro now."
1028774,lew,2018-05-24 21:49:00,12766,"Yes they do Terry, it's recommended you have a water softener. "
1028867,aplumma,2018-05-28 13:08:00,6896,Terry the hidden cost of the tankless heaters are they do scale up. It needs to be capped off and solvent clean every 1-3 years depending on the build up rate. They also allow people to use more hot water meaning 3 kids and 2 adults all want to shower in the morning call all get a 10 minute shower. With a conventional heater 75 gallons they all will get a 5 minute shower. The BTU rating of the tankless heaters have up to 3 times the burn rate so they can keep the coils hot when the water flows thru. So 50 minutes of 3 times the burn rate is 150 minutes of burn time compared to 75 gallon 1/3 burn rate for 1 hour. That means to keep the water warm thru the day to equal the amount of gas consumed the heater would have to run just shy of 2 hours. Now if people use the tankless heater in the same pattern meaning 5 minute showers then they do save money. Art
