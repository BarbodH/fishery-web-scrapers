1029045,Fisherman,2018-05-31 00:28:00,7201,Nice work.
1029048,porkpie,2018-05-31 00:36:00,2521,"They where out at Buckhorn the Friday before the sanctuary opened.  They issued a lot of charges.  It was very nice to see. '""'"
1029060,AKRISONER,2018-05-31 12:31:00,5558,hopefully the fines are big and the bans are long. Friggin idiots keeping bass inside a fish sanctuary...wow
1029062,KawarthaAngler,2018-05-31 12:50:00,273,"Agreed.  Good to see they were out charging selfish and inconsiderate people.  Fishing out of season, having beyond the limit, in a sanctuary .... etc. I was on the water (Pigeon Lake) with a friend on the holiday Monday and saw the OPP boat on the water, doing the rounds."
1029066,jimmer,2018-05-31 13:42:00,2730,"I had the Ministry check me on Pigeon lake the Monday evening of the long weekend, sort of caught me off guard.  So sad to hear that people still don't get it and probably never will.  Living on lower Pigeon Lake, you get to see all kinds; from people keeping walleye out of the slot, filling buckets of large bluegill and crappie and fishing for bass out of season. It would have been nice to see the Ministry on the Saturday, but I guess they were focusing on the sanctuaries. Nice to see the charges, but sad that it has to come to this. Why can't people police themselves. Yes, I know the answer......."
1029071,PUMP KNOWS,2018-05-31 14:35:00,937,Good to see them out but would like to see them out more often
1029078,Sinker,2018-05-31 19:56:00,8692,"I got checked on the water for the first time in MANY years last week. All good, and great guys. No issues. Nice to finally see them.  S."
1029080,SaugaPikeSlayer,2018-05-31 21:11:00,48,Got checked shore fishing in Mississauga last year!
1029083,Moosebunk,2018-06-01 02:10:00,3970,OMNR gave me a parking ticket! Buggers!!! lol. At least they're doing something I guess.
