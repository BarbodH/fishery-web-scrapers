1028664,Old Ironmaker,2018-05-22 17:40:00,8243,Can't beat that FF. It doesn't get much better. Way to go. We had a few feeds of Fiddleheads a few weeks back as the gardens around our place have many.

It wobbles a bit and my clicker has been replaced.  But it stil works and i find it hard to get rid or upgrade gear like that.  In fact, I also have the same Daiwa rod 12ft and it’s taken a beating and still delivers. You can see in the vid some of the cork has chipped  off.  So old, I don’t think that cork can suck up anymore roe juice. Haha."
