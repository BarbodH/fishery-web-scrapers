1029139,DRIFTER_016,2018-06-02 22:23:00,10439,After way more work than I expected the new 12'X24' home for the hovercraft is up and finished!!! Even fired her up today. She runs mint!!! Next project get the boat ready.   
1029171,Sinker,2018-06-03 16:24:00,8692,Isn't this the time of year you want to be using the hover craft?  S.
1029178,DRIFTER_016,2018-06-03 18:31:00,10439,Should be. Will be using it in the fall during ice up. Too much work to do right now to be playin'
1029183,akaShag,2018-06-03 23:43:00,2073,"Never mind a bow-mount motor Dave, get a bow-mount .50 calibre machine gun! Doug"
1027533,DRIFTER_016,2018-04-27 16:57:00,10439,Bought through govt. auction in the US. Just need to run down to Wisconsin and pick it up.          
1027534,grimsbylander,2018-04-27 17:00:00,3016,LOL Sweet! The Polar Bear Express!!
1027535,DRIFTER_016,2018-04-27 17:11:00,10439,I can now get out to the cabin 365 days a year.
1027536,grimsbylander,2018-04-27 17:14:00,3016,I figured that why you'd want it. Very slick machine Dave...you'll have to post some videos once you get it into action. Congrats.
1027538,KawarthaAngler,2018-04-27 17:23:00,273,That is just too cool ....
1027539,AKRISONER,2018-04-27 17:28:00,5558,when do we install the downriggers?
1027540,misfish,2018-04-27 17:30:00,29133,That is super cool Dave
1027542,DRIFTER_016,2018-04-27 17:36:00,10439,I'm thinkin' it could use a bow mounted trolling motor.
1027547,Terry,2018-04-27 18:15:00,14456,Nice toy
1027549,aplumma,2018-04-27 18:45:00,6896,Nice grab for sure. You should find that it is well maintained being a County vehicle they get an amazing amount of care. Art
1027558,Fisherman,2018-04-27 23:19:00,7201,Wonder what it's like going up any hills?
1027561,DRIFTER_016,2018-04-28 00:10:00,10439,They don't side hill but can go up hill fairly well. I just hope it will climb the hill to the cabin once it's graded and graveled. Got a parking spot for it under the deck.
1027562,OhioFisherman,2018-04-28 00:17:00,6623,I think I saw that thing in Star Wars lV!
1027563,Fisherman,2018-04-28 00:18:00,7201,"Nice,  you can just slide over to anyone with a portable hut and blow him out of your favourite spot..."
1027566,DRIFTER_016,2018-04-28 01:47:00,10439,While doing donuts around them!!!!
1027576,Rizzo,2018-04-28 13:31:00,4754,that is sweet! Plus the girls will think you are a fireman...that goes a long way
1027670,lunkerbasshunter,2018-04-30 15:45:00,2585,that is amazing
1027677,Headhunter,2018-04-30 20:27:00,5703,No Brakes!!!! Have a blast with that thing... but be sure you don't put your foot through the floor lookin for the brakes! HH
1027683,DRIFTER_016,2018-04-30 21:27:00,10439,"FYI, it does have brakes. The lever on the left side controls shutters that close of rear directed air. "
1027694,iFish4real,2018-05-01 02:11:00,386,"Where's the trolling motor going, bow or stern? ???"
1027699,John Bacon,2018-05-01 02:27:00,3277,I am no expert; but that sounds more like neutral than brakes...
1027701,DRIFTER_016,2018-05-01 02:33:00,10439,If you really want to stop in a hurry you spin it 180 degrees and it'll stop.
1027747,Canuck,2018-05-01 22:10:00,491,If the engine stalls on the water does it float?
1027749,iFish4real,2018-05-01 22:18:00,386,That's where you start blowing ?
1027750,DRIFTER_016,2018-05-01 22:22:00,10439,"UH, yes. It's a boat that flies. 3:28 in he starts and stops on the water. "
