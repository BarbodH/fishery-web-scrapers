1028824,Freshtrax,2018-05-26 16:25:00,2215,Were headed to Nipigon for a week and taking the senic route home and plan on splitting it up over a few days.  Looking for a place to pitch out tents in this region not too far from the highway even better would be a chance to launch the boat and catch a walleye.  Any suggstions via pm would be much appecated.  Crown land is best but pp. Would also be fine.   Thanks guys.
1028830,G.mech,2018-05-26 23:18:00,830,"There is a place right on the highway called Lake Lauzon Resort & Marine.  I stayed a couple of nights in their bed and breakfast one time but they have a nice campground and cabins too.  They have a ramp, docks etc but I think its more of a Lake Trout lake than walleye. http://lakelauzonresort.com/"
1028831,pike slayer,2018-05-26 23:36:00,1177,Lots of lakes behind Bruce mines with decent walleye pike bass lakes. Good walleye fishing between wawa and white river. When you headed this direction?
1028833,Freshtrax,2018-05-27 03:39:00,2215,Coming back that way  the weekend after next after a week at Nipigon.
