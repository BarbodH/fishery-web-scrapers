1028952,TJQ,2018-05-29 15:37:00,7806,"OK, here ya go. Finally up to camp, 6 months since we left, and everything is in good shape, which always worries me. The loggers took the bridge out so were back to a 4km ATV ride in after a 300km drive up! Water is still high on the river and cold which slows our fishing down. Still no leaves on the birch trees and the blackflies are just starting. Fishing for a few days and then heading home for grads etc... gonna do our best to get back for at least a week a month this year, with the kids on their own we can come when the weather suits us. Caught a few little pike, but no bass which is odd. Maybe try for some pickeral tonight... and maybe just a campfire.. who knows!              "

1028976,lunkerbasshunter,2018-05-30 02:52:00,2585,If the water is high and cold still that could mean the bass haven't spawned yet so that may explain the lack of bite.  I have family up that way in kirkland lake and the ice didnt melt until the long weekend.  The latest they have seen it go out.
