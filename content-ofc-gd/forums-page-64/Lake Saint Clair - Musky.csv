1028915,HTHM,2018-05-28 21:31:00,4082,I am going to venture out on to LSC for the first time in search of musky on opening day. Probably going to launch by the mouth of the Thames does anyone have any general tips or any advice on tactics to try? If you have any advise on places please P.M. them to me.
