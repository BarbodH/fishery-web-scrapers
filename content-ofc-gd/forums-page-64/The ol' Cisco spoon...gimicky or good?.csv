1028297,scuro2,2018-05-13 02:00:00,904," Got these at an estate sale along with a pile of other spoons. From the look of the other spoons I would guess they are about 20 years old?  	I've never fished them, are they any good, and if they are when would you use them?"

1028302,scuro2,2018-05-13 02:57:00,904,These lures are about 5 inches. The rest of the collection looked to be for larger trout or pike. Apparently there is a whole Cisco product line and they are/were made in Canada. http://www.canadianwiggler.com/cisco  	How do you fish them?
