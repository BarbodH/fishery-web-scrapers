1029131,misfish,2018-06-02 15:55:00,29133,Nice .  I had my legs dangling in the 58 deg water this morning so I could stay cool. Getting to hot already.  To bad the fishing was not.

1029140,spincast,2018-06-02 23:11:00,3279,"it was brutal. I thought about putting up the bimini, but figured gotta acclimatize. The sun was not super bright, with thin high level clouds, but the humidity made it feel like trolling in hair gel..  Did the trick from my days as a mover - put hat in water, fill,  put on head.. Repeat as required. Convince the brain you aren't really being steamed like a vegetable and  it'll be ok   Did I miss the annual Brian & Terry bug filled laker outing report?"
