267710,TJQ,2008-11-15 18:13:00,7806,"My three year old Yardworks LogSplitter has lost a bit of power at the very end of the stroke (LOL.. ya ya I know... ya don't even have to say it... but your all thinking it...)  The unit has performed awesomely till now, its been abused and left out over the winter, its split at least 75 cord of wood for me and has been an awesome investment for 300 bucks.  anyway I lost the manual a long time ago and the paper with the model # on it has long since worn off the unit.  Does anyone else have one of these, i need to know what hydraulic oil to use (i know nothing about hydraulics) and what I would do to add some or change it.   I want to see if I can fix it up so it will last the last bit of the fall here.  If needed Ill post some pictures."
267713,POLLIWOGG,2008-11-15 18:19:00,835,I don't have one but probably transmission fluid.
267720,Greencoachdog,2008-11-15 18:35:00,8163,"TJ, you can purchase hydraulic fluid at almost any Power Equipment supply shop... i.e John Deere, Toro, etc.  I wouldn't use the tranny fluid except for a last resort... do you have any power tilt/trim fluid for your boat? It would be very close, if not the same thing.  Here's where you can get an online manual, you really prolly need to look at it.  http://www.mtdcanada.com/model-search.asp  Working on a hydraulic system while under pressure is very dangerous!"
267729,OhioFisherman,2008-11-15 18:52:00,6623,You can get hydraulic fluid from a TSC store if there is one near you. No model numbers stamped on it anywhere? Probably any auto parts store or tractor dealer.  http://answers.canadiantire.ca/answers/904...P/questions.htm        Might help?
267735,douG,2008-11-15 19:01:00,2693,"Ayup, TJ, what Glen said.  High pressure is scary - rtfm."
267737,Bernie,2008-11-15 19:03:00,3190,Power steering fluid will work just fine TJ. Too many different types of transmission fluid now for me to feel comfortable recommending using it for hydraulic applications such as yours. Go and see Randy at Bensons.
267750,misfish,2008-11-15 19:24:00,29133,"Hey TJ  If you want a guy that can help you with just a phone call Give Jack a call. He deals with all types of machines. Very good at it.
