266675,TroutnMuskieHunter,2008-11-12 12:51:00,1362,"Now that's what i call a GREAT day on the water   .....good job fishnsled!!....those are some nice lookin' ski's!!!.....  After reading your report and seein those fish, I think I'll take the afternoon off today and head out on the river"
266681,tinbanger,2008-11-12 13:19:00,1028,what a report some great looking fish.   Just need one of those before the ice closes in !  TB
266688,Headhunter,2008-11-12 13:39:00,5703,"I told you Saturday, you should go to Quinte and not bother fishin for those fish of 10,000 casts! But oh no, you'd rather waste a day chasing those ugly things!!!! LMAO!!! I guess Cliff really did school yah and yah took it ta heart! Still LMAO! Awesome day bud! Congrats... so how's Ken's ticker doing! Has he stopped shaking yet?!!!(Once again LMAO!) HH"
266700,Pachone,2008-11-12 15:16:00,276,wow! great report!  I love the Jaw pic!!! NASTY TEETH!!
266713,fishnsled,2008-11-12 16:07:00,3520," Peter, I'll be in touch.  I know after talking how busy you are right now but I'll put together an order and we'll square up on the opener next year.   As for the pic of the head shot, pm me your email and I'll send you a copy of the original for the best quality.     I was there and as Cliff said, what happens on the boat, stays on the boat.  Right Cliff?   Thanks Cliff, the week before was your day, just don't ever do that to me again.    Maybe at Lakair next year after a few brown pops we might let what happened that day slip out.   The way those fish fought it would be like putting a 20hp on the back of your yak.   I could not believe the power they had for this time of year.  What a thrill!    She's more of a fair weather fishing person EC1.  Thanks for the reply    It's close enough to noon, go and get'em!    I know Joe.  The original plan was to hit Quinte but with the forecast of the winds we opted for a smaller body of water.  Foolish, just foolish.    Ken and Gerry are recovering.  They left with their arms in slings and wearing back braces after throwing the big baits all day.    Something they were not use to.  As for Cliff,  just some fun times.  Everyone has their day it just so happens that mine was MUCH better then his.    Thanks for the replies eveyone.  Almost for got Wild, no pics of the BNB special.  Just a big inline spinner that looks like (as Gerry called it) a feather duster with a single blade up top."
266715,ccmtcanada,2008-11-12 16:11:00,7971,"  But no...you weren't bitter....LOL.  Can't believe I'm going to say this, but we gotta hit the ice this winter Will."
266719,fishnsled,2008-11-12 16:34:00,3520,"  Not bitter at all Cliff.    I look at it this way, 8 muskies have come into my boat in 2 outtings, pretty damn good I'd say.      And yes, I'll get you on the ice this winter, see if we can't get you into a whitey or laker."
266795,Handlebarz,2008-11-12 21:28:00,3790,congratz on a great day out there will you have some very  nice looking musky
267532,fishingisliving,2008-11-14 21:58:00,170,"WOW!!!  who doesn't beleive in moon phases?? two days later...   we hit these on rememberance day. I knew it was amazing that we scored so well this time of year, but now I see you did the same two days before us.. WOW! The fish were really going! check out the full story:       the last one... was HEAVY!"
266487,fishnsled,2008-11-11 22:01:00,3520,"The last few weekends haven't be the greatest for me on the water.  A day of fish following and a day of watching Cliff hook into 4 beauties.  Certainly nice to be there and see Cliff's PB first hand but what's a guy to do to get a fish??  Sunday started off with my buddies Ken and Gerry meeting at my place for 5:15AM, loaded up and on the road for 5:30am.  We were hoping to find some minnows to do some jigging but no one was open.  At the lake and fishing by 8am.  First cast a big fish swirls just off the boat.  Good or bad sign I think to myself.   We carry on working the edge and I have a follow of a decent fish.  Worked along for about another 500 yards or so and decide to go back to where we started.  I changed up to a Brickn'Block special, an inline spinner that Peter made up for me last year on a outting we did.  I've used it a few times without any luck but for some reason it was calling to me.  Second cast with the Bn'B special and fish on!  And a big one to boot!  After a couple of good runs we get a luck at her and my jaw hits the floor as I'm thinking it could bring me into the 50"" club, I'm a little doubtful.  Barely hooked, one hook in the skin on the outside of the jaw,  I guide her into the craddle, nice job on the craddle Ken.  A couple of measurements and photos, then back into the water she went.  Considering the fight she swam away strongly.  48""x19"", not a PB but my 3rd biggest so far.        We kept on working the edge for a while and moved onto spot #2.  With my newly found favourite bait, we worked the next edge.  Just as we are getting to the end I have a fish on for a couple of seconds then gone.  We go back to make another pass and I have a few follows and then bang!  Fish #2 for me.  Another great fight and into the craddle, thanks Ken.  A smaller fish of only 44x16.    We decide to have some lunch and plan out the rest of the day.  At spot #3 I offer up my hot bait to the guys.  Neither has got a musky before and I'd like to see it happen.  They kindly say no and and make a couple more cast before setting the hook on this beauty.  44.75x17.25.    and the release.     Once again I offer up the bait but no takers.  A fire off a dozen casts or so and hook into my 4th of the day.  The boat went silent except for me repeatedly saying ""Sorry""  Great job on the craddle again Ken.  This one would be the smallest fish of the day for me at 39"".    I once again offer the bait up and it nearly started a fight!   Not really but Ken didn't turn it down.  lol!  A few follows for myself but still nothing for the guys.  The rain and hail came in and we called it a day.  Considering neither Ken or Gerry had seen a musky before they were both very please with what they saw.   I could almost call it quits for the season after a day like that but I won't  Thanks Ken and Gerry for the good times and laughs.  A very special thanks to Brickn'Block for my new favourite bait.  Peter, I'll need a few more of those baits.  Thanks for reading!"
266488,lew,2008-11-11 22:06:00,12767,"WTG Will, that's a great day on the water for you !!  I've got one of those BnB baits myself, their pretty darned nice."
266489,cram,2008-11-11 22:07:00,1733,That is seriously amazing.  I can't even imagine.  Funny -- general rule is to put away the inline spinners right now (too fast for such cold water).  Guess your FOUR muskies didn't read that book!!  Curious - kawarthas?
266490,muskyhunter5150,2008-11-11 22:09:00,64,"Wow, wish i could have a day like that. Good job"
266500,ccmtcanada,2008-11-11 22:38:00,7971,"Hey Will...great job out there but were the voicemails really necessary???  ""Hey Cliff, it's Will...just got a 48""er, so put that in your pipe and SMOKE IT!!!""  LOL  No...he wasn't bitter about the weekend before was he?? haha.  Great job out there...I bet your buddies were impressed!!"
266504,Paully,2008-11-11 22:55:00,712,Awsome Day you had! Keep it up...
266505,Streamerguy,2008-11-11 22:57:00,121, LOL...........I sure wouldn't either!!  Great report and pics   Streamerguy 
266510,glen,2008-11-11 23:03:00,2641,Congrats on an awesome day.  Not only four muskies but good sized ones too.  You raised the bar on Cliff.
266512,Rich,2008-11-11 23:05:00,3927,"Dang I miss fishing..  Awesome, congrats!"
266518,irishfield,2008-11-11 23:13:00,26272,Great stuff Will... water is still warmer than most falls so the inlines make sense.. I guess ! LOL  Some nice fishies there !!!  Got me thinking why the f I'm going to BOQ this weekend when I could hit the bay for skis! Oh ya... the laughs.
266519,jediangler,2008-11-11 23:14:00,1923,"Nice work, and all very healthy looking critters too."
266521,solopaddler,2008-11-11 23:15:00,8605,"Unbelievable, what a day!  (I've got a feeling Peter will be getting some pm's  )"
266525,brickNblock,2008-11-11 23:25:00,598,"Will,  Congrats on a successful day..... You sure didnt have this poor luck prior to this day when we have gone out....  I betcha your buddies Ken NGerry will think twice next time and just the fact that they witnessed your catches, 'Me Thinks they'll be turned on to the hunt now. Cliff shouldnt worry about the messages  'Right Cliff""...better then none.  Hey Bud, when your certain, give me a shout about what setup you'd like in the baits. Blade colour,Boo/hair, trebsNsingle or all trebs..(I actually prefer having a larger single at the end..plastics attachNlook great and ease in hook removal....  Lately Ive been using 10/0 singles for the last hook with, 8/0-trebs 1st and 7/0 trebs in the middle.......... .........------'KEEPÃ‰M SHARP'------........!  Will, that 2nd pic with the head shot is awesome.....If its OK with you Im going to enlarge that pic for my wall.  We'll getTOgethernext year........'Perhaps the Opener?  Great Day out Bud, take care pete   (Usually, about every 10 casts I bring out the file..for a couple a quick strokes to keep the edge)"
266526,2 tone z71,2008-11-11 23:29:00,1311,beautifull fish wow what a day

266539,tbayboy,2008-11-11 23:56:00,1497,Now that is one perfect day.  Four nice fish plus you didn't break your PB so you have still a reason to get back out there this weekend .  Congrats.
266543,Greencoachdog,2008-11-12 00:11:00,8163,Excellent report and pics!!!  Some beautiful Muskies there too!!!  Cliffs fish were little weenie fish compared to those!!!

266548,ccmtcanada,2008-11-12 00:17:00,7971," Thanks!!  Everyone loves to get on my case...LOL  And GCD...yep...Will schools me most times out!!!  I had a lucky day...I can admit that....  Oh yeah, there was another reason I maybe outfished him that day, but what happens on the boat stays on the boat....  Again Will....great job out there...that 48 incher was a real beaut!!!"
266551,Joey,2008-11-12 00:21:00,9122,That's freakin awesome Will.  Congratulations.  I'm excited just reading this    Can imagine how you feel.  Joey
