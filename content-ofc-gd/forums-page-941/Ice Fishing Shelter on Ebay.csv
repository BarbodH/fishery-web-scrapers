267441,kingjames_2nd,2008-11-14 18:24:00,72,If I was on E-bay I might bid.  Can anybody vouche for this particular brand or model?  EBAY Ice Hut Link Link
267480,fishnsled,2008-11-14 20:10:00,3520,"Personally I can't but have heard that they are a bit of pain to set up and take down.  If you're on the move a lot then a ""Clam"" type set up might be a better choice."
267484,bigugli,2008-11-14 20:15:00,6138,"I looked at one  earlier. As fns said, there is more work in setting up. In wind that can be a problem.  I also was not too impressed with the overall construction"
267568,camillj,2008-11-14 23:57:00,1988,Yep pain to set up ... not too thin at all ... actually surprisingly warm ... but not the best in high winds ... I personally love this one because the ice screws cant be beat even in the highest of winds ... and setup is easy even if you are alone.   http://cgi.ebay.ca/4-person-Ice-Cube-Shelt...A1%7C240%3A1318  But dont be fooled ... 4 man is they way to go for 2 of you ... 2 man is just right if you are alone
267570,misfish,2008-11-15 00:05:00,29133,"Obvisouly,you have not fished with Terry. He needs a 4 man for one.LOL  Not seeing much wrong with it,except the assembly."
267695,JMahon,2008-11-15 17:10:00,48,"I have the 4 man & it's really not too thin, it is suprisingly warm inside. It is a bit of a pain in the ass to set up  (exactly like a tent).. & it really isn't that great in the wind!  To sum it up it's basically just a glorified tent with the bottom cut out!    But it's better than nothing!!  I got mine & an 8"" auger for $50, in my opinion unless you get a good deal like that, save your money & go for a better one!"
267775,Fang,2008-11-15 20:49:00,1330,Sears sold this one in the winter catalogue last year. Saw some over the summer on clear out rack at Dixie Mall in Mississauga.  Buy it form Sears and if you don't like it easier to return
267956,gone_fishin,2008-11-16 06:18:00,481,"it says, ""Sets up in minutes..."" but how many minutes??? if it's like any other tent, i'd say SEVERAL minutes! lol.  i sure wouldn't pay over $100 for that... i'd rather sit on a bucket out on the open ice."
267970,Rich,2008-11-16 12:02:00,3927,You don't want to be wasting your time attempting to set that up in the wind (aka chasing it across the lake). Buddy had one. We spent about an hour setting it up in 25k winds then we were pretty much propping it up with our heads the rest of the trip because the wind blew it right over. Good thing he had decent ice anchors!
