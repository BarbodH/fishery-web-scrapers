I will likely keep the old girl for fishing still, however .....  I was looking for a new toy for this winter and this is what I picked up today.  It's a 1999 MXZ 600...    I'll bet we have the mildest winter in years now...kinda like going out and buying a new snowblower..lol    Hey GreenCoachDog...you ever been on a sled?????  Hopefully see ya on the lake....  Cheers  Craig"
