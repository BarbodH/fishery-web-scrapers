I live in west end toronto near the humber, is there any place that i can do this in the west end from toronto to burlington and have the chance to get into a few fish?  Ive never done it here, ive seen guys do it at rivermouths out east, is it done in the west and if so where?  i dont have a lot of time but found some time tomorrow and would love to give it a shot.  thanks"
