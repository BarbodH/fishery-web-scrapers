The weather was not very co-operative or pleasant but we decided to head out and fish the south side of Georgina Island for some perch.  With the wind blowing out of the north at approximately 20-30 kmh, it was a rough ride out to our starting spot.  The rain mixed in with the wind made for some very cold uncomfortable conditions but the fish were fairly feisty.  We managed to bring 29 decent fish in the 10 inch range and one measured at 13 1/4 inches.  Threw back a bunch of smaller ones for the next trip.  The ride back to the boat launch was rougher than the ride out with around 4 ft waves coming at us from the Northwest.  We all made it back safe and sound, a little wet and cold but we braved the elements and brought home enough perch for a good fish fry!  Here's the beginning of the cleaning assembly line.  The pre-cleaning quality inspection by my little jack.  She likes to give each fish a lick as they come out of the bucket.    Second stage is the fileting quality inspector.  This cat likes to chew the fins off the fileted fish and enjoys the odd taste of fish eggs.    Here's half the days catch.  That's the 13 1/4"" on the top.    And here's the big one of the day.  My dad is the one who actually caught it, but being the lowest seniority of the group of us, I'm the one who gets to clean the fish.      PB"

267984,bigugli,2008-11-16 13:22:00,6138, Your jack doesn't try to steal the fish? My fish thieving dog is sooo bad I have to either bring home a small one(live) for her to chew on or a few live minnows     When we take her fishing she gets very excited whenever a fish is caught.  Congrats on a successful outing despite the wind and weather.
