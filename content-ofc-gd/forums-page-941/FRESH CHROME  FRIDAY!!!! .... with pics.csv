267493,jdmls,2008-11-14 20:47:00,575,"Here's a little , retaliation to Silvio and BBNotty's post from yesterday !!!  I had a few hours this morning, and I new the rain would have helped bring in a good run of fish. Figured I would get out today as the rain we are expecting tonight/tomorrow is gonna blow out most of the rivers for the weekend. Water was the perfect greeeeen.... prob about 20"" visability, which made for perfect conditions...Picked the wrong river at first light but got to the right one by about 10AM....We fished for 2 hours with not stop action, one after another !!! .                                                                                                                                               The poor roe bag slingers were throwing bags out all morning and we walked in the pool at 10AM with the artificials and cleaned up... In the last few weeks I have gained some new found confidence in flies, jigs, and plastics. The take downs are so much more fierce and aggressive..What a rush when the float just drops  10"" in the blink of an eye !!!  Here's a few of the fish we got into  First drift my buddy smacked this fat hen....   I follwed up  on my second drift with this football   4th drift Steve hits this freshy      Sorry, had to distort the fly... Silvio has me sworn to secrecy on it !!!      A little west coast pose   You wouldn't believe it , but I caught this fish again about 3 drifts later on the same single egg pattern...   Even the blue heron was catching fish !!!... I couldn't believe he swallowed this 1lb steelie     And the icing on the cake, was this mid teens male Buck !!....Took Steve a good 15min to finally get him in... What a battle... Amazing watching his IMX turn this fish in and out of every snag it could find.    The stretch makes it look 20lbs, LOL   The release "
