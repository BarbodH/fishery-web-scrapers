266933,ehg,2008-11-13 03:14:00,2666,Caught this fish in the Oshawa Creek on an orange Beno.       It was actually caught in 1978 when i was eight years old. Really had no clue what i was doing but got new fishing rod(Cherrywood) and (Mitchell) spinning reel so i learned to cast. Put that lure on and casted a pool and wham! I was further hooked on fishing. Luckily i lived across street from Thomas St. bridge so much steelheading was done throughout the 1980's.  Just found this picture while rummaging through things this evening.
266944,Paulus,2008-11-13 03:35:00,522,"  Thanks for sharing. The first Steelhead is never the last.  Must've been nice to have steelhead mere ...... ""steps"" .... uh-yuk-yuk-yuk... from your house    p.-"
267091,ehg,2008-11-13 16:53:00,2666,"Thanks for reply Paulus,   it was nice to have oppurtunity so close. Had to move from the 'Shwa though.  Thought i'd post this pic to show an old school rainbow from an eastern trib. Wilmot was all the rage then. Steelheading was similar back then, fresh roe under blackbird floats during or after rains was best.  No drennan products, centerpins or 13 ft rods back in the day."
267097,NAC,2008-11-13 17:05:00,369,I remember those days. That's back when the fish used to outnumber the fisherman on Huron and Geo Bay tribs.  retro steelie for sure!
267101,fishnpro,2008-11-13 17:22:00,93,Love to fish that stretch myself on occasion.
267155,kemper,2008-11-13 20:22:00,2232,"Thats my stompin grounds!  Got my first steelie from right under the Thomas street bridge. That pool is all washed out now, which SUCKS because it was dynamite in the winter.  Thanks!"
267490,snag,2008-11-14 20:29:00,1932,Nice one.  I was thinking of starting a thread asking folks to post their earliest catch.  S
267502,packrat,2008-11-14 21:02:00,93,The first one is really a rush isnt it----the rest are fun but just not the same.  Gotta love chrome.
267508,ccmtcanada,2008-11-14 21:17:00,7971,Very cool picture ehg!  I guess you always remember the first one eh?  You have one of you holding the fish?
267585,ehg,2008-11-15 01:10:00,2666,"Snag, i think that is the first picture of a fish i caught. Found that picture in a box of old family picture albums.  Actually caught that fish about 400 meters south of Thomas St. at first deep bend but that was 30 yrs. ago. Spent 90% of my time on that creek down by the now non -existent marina.   I don't have a picture holding that fish,  my father took the picture without my knowledge.  this is earliest picture could find of holding fish. Some walleye my MOTHER and i caught at Pigeon in early 80's   Caught all those on gold rapala J-9, still one of my best days of fishing. Wish i still had the hair though."
267626,kemper,2008-11-15 03:12:00,2232,"  That hole south of the bridge is still there, and still holds fish. As does the marina, you just have to be careful fishing it because the security makes rounds and will toss you out.  I always wonder why anyone pays to have security at that place, there is NOTHING there anymore"
267627,sturgman,2008-11-15 03:21:00,249,Nice fish.. I only wish I could catch a steelie in these parts.. Guess im forced to fish for Musky in the fall.
