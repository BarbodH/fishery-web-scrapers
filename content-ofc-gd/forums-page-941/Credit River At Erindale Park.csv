267269,MarcusDiGiovanni,2008-11-14 01:31:00,182,Does anyone know any locations at Erindale Park where I can fly fish for steelhead or salmon. Directions would be much apreciated
267280,BillM,2008-11-14 01:48:00,17367,"Might wanna introduce yourself, say hello then ask for some tips.  Usually works better that way."
267282,Paulus,2008-11-14 01:50:00,522,"Entrance is on N side of Dundas at Mississauga Rd and Dundas. Park there, and walk it up and down. The entire stretch is fly-fishable and pretty much wide open (i.e lots of room to cast). No sense trying to predict which spot will be best as it varies and there are lots. Try the ones you find, and good luck!    p.-"

267561,misfish,2008-11-14 23:34:00,29133,  I just seen this.  TOO FUNNY.
267619,MarcusDiGiovanni,2008-11-15 02:58:00,182,"Sorry about that. Let me start over. My names Marcus and I'm new to fishing the credit river or any rivers for that matter. I wanted to get into some steelhead and ive heard that Erindale Park is a good place to go to hook into some fish. If anyone has any tips, or locations that would be great. All information is welcome. thanx, Marcus"
267621,MarcusDiGiovanni,2008-11-15 03:00:00,182,"So, Dundas and Missisauga road isn't a good place? :S"
267629,douG,2008-11-15 03:31:00,2693,"Marcus, go forth and prosper.   There are fish everywhere at some time or other based on things I can't pretend to understand.  Steelhead in the rivers which feed the great lakes are a good bet right now.  Go get em."
267633,MarcusDiGiovanni,2008-11-15 03:44:00,182,Truer words were never spoken! Thanx
