I cam across a quote from Aristotle that seemed fitting to the many rants about trash at our fishing holes.  ""What is common to many is taken least care of, for all men have greater regard for what is their own than for what they possess in common with others.""  - Aristotle    Maybe a useless post, maybe not.
