267641,camillj,2008-11-15 04:35:00,1988,Great report  MB ... but sorry ... nothing will ever compare to that Tree River report ... an Epic ... 'cept maybe the kissin the 500lber back on his merry way .... one day
267815,Moosebunk,2008-11-15 23:38:00,3970," Not quite fair but, if that's the bar it'll have to be leapt.   This report kind of lacked fish eh!!!  And the length on the black and white pike was for certain a huuuuuge stretch... just messin' witchyas.  Thanks again all."
268039,jediangler,2008-11-16 15:33:00,1923,"Great report and pics, as always. Next time you're going to slap a critter on the butt, set up your camera on video so we can all watch. I would have loved to see that   ."

266494,HTHM,2008-11-11 22:22:00,4082,"Great report as always! Judging from the title I was expecting a tale of woe, but you were able to turn it around and enjoy yourself regardless. There is still room at BOQ, hint hint"

266515,irishfield,2008-11-11 23:08:00,26272,Thanks Drew... needed that bit of fish porn.  Oh.. and the hole in the roof... priceless!  Hugs for the spooky gals and give Brenda a big one for me...condolences on the loss of her sister.

266530,limeyangler,2008-11-11 23:33:00,5204,"Brilliant read....love the seal pics. i'm sure with your superior 'anglination' powers you'll get that monster in the end.  AWESOME PICS, AWESOME REPORT (as usual)  Thanks man."
266538,Bernie,2008-11-11 23:54:00,3190,Well done MB! I have come to the point to expect nothing less from you. Some magazine material there for sure. And we are fortunate to have you post it here.
266553,ccmtcanada,2008-11-12 00:23:00,7971,"Still an epic report Drew!!  That 48"" pike sure was a brute!!  Condolences to Bren (and family and all who knew her) on the news of her sister's passing...very sad.  It's great you met up with Snag up there too...didn't know he was up your way.....  Great report again....cant wait to see that 500lb'er come thru the ice in your winter report!!"
266560,Greencoachdog,2008-11-12 00:41:00,8163,My Oh My!... the big'un got away!!!... where ever have I heard that one before?  Man!... I was all ready for some sticker peckin' out fish porn (had my britches adjusted and everything!)............. then.... nothing!!!  I'm so fishually frustrated... I'm going to have to go master bait!!!    Great report and pics 'Bunk!!!  You'll get that monster next time!!!
266566,Moosebunk,2008-11-12 01:04:00,3970," Now my little hobbit friend Cliff, is this response to me a riddle of sorts.  Should I be drinking more gumbleberry juice to decipher the code?  I never met up with any Snag... nor did I catch any 48 inchers.  That fish was maybe a 28 too.   My sponsors will never know though...    What report were you reading btw dood.  Thanks though, and yeah... the 500lb'er through the ice at -30C this february oughtta be a real treat.   He's taken one rod down the hole, straightened a buddies split ring on his spoon, and snapped 50lb Spiderwire before.  The fish won't come willingly.    GCD... sorry I couldn't get it up for ya this time.  Likely not my handy work though, you're just getting old and impotent I suppose.    Thanks gang.  It's a feel good report to get something posted... it's been a tough couple months on many fronts."
266571,Greencoachdog,2008-11-12 01:20:00,8163, Tell that to the Bonersaurus!!!    That done it!... now yer breakin' my frakin' heart!!!
266578,Bernie,2008-11-12 01:37:00,3190, Ha. Even I figured this one out Cliff.
266584,mukluk,2008-11-12 01:47:00,196,Man I sure enjoyed those pictures! Thanks for sharing.
266590,the spirit of fishing,2008-11-12 02:03:00,141,"Congrats on the cover photo and article. I always look forward to your reports and you never disappoint,thanks for the great read. So sorry for your family's loss."
266593,Dano,2008-11-12 02:04:00,719,"Haha! Well done bunk. That's a sweet pike man, congrats. Love the pics, especially the seal. Cool stuff, thanks."
266611,ccmtcanada,2008-11-12 02:34:00,7971, Come on Moosebunk!! Bernie got my riddle....  This is SNAG's avatar....I hear he's a fish hog. 
266649,forrest,2008-11-12 04:10:00,1032,I could smell the fresh air fro the pics and story.  That was a nice read mb.
266671,Moosebunk,2008-11-12 12:21:00,3970, Yeah Cliff.  This came to me last night just before falling asleep.  The little light bulb went off in my head and I thought about coming downstairs and telling you and all the folks here in the Shire that I figured it out.  But I failed with that ambition... now beasts will descend down from Isangaard and slay us all.  So sorry.  I'll never doubt ya again my good man.
266676,TJQ,2008-11-12 12:54:00,7806,Incredible report as always..... amn always an adventure!!  Thanks very much for posting MB.  Awesome reports every time!
266741,wuchikubo,2008-11-12 18:18:00,1114,Great report as always Drew. Please give my condolences to Bren and the rest the family and friends regarding the passing of her sister.  The teepee work looks great too!  So how do you get the power sockets installed to hook up the internet in that?  That Arctic Char is burned into my memory from your earlier post. I've got it down as one of the things to try in my life time.  Thanks for sharing.
266785,fishnsled,2008-11-12 21:15:00,3520,"First - My condolences to Bren and the rest the family and friends, sorry for their loss.  Second - Great report as always!  That 500 pounder must have been a heart stopper when you saw her at the boat.     Great pics too!"
