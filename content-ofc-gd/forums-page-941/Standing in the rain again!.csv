I didn't know what to expect with the rain we got last night, but the river was only up about a foot and the water was only a little dirty. As soon as we walked down to the hole i frequent we seen a few jumping around. So it was a good thing i brought my dad out cause he went 2/2 and got a pretty nice workout on the one nice seven pounder. I ended up getting one little one no bigger than 2 pounds. I guess it pays to be out in the rain! "
