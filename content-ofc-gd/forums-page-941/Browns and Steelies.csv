267005,Pepe,2008-11-13 13:23:00,21,"The steelhead itch finally got so bad I had to go... We left Montreal at midnight and headed towards New york State. Fished all day monday and tuesday till 11 am, we fighted around 25 fish between the 2 of us and got 15 or 16 to the net. All in all a great few days on the tribs, decent weather, great fish and good company! here is some fish porn.        The colors on all the fish we caught were incredible, most of the steelies were colored up but we did get a few chromers.  Pepe"
