I've never really used a bow before (other than archery at summer camp), and I'm used to handling a shotgun at work but i don't necessarily like using it, but I'm wondering which do you prefer to hunt with? Is one better than the other? Are there benefits to using one over the other?  Any info would be appreciated.  Thanks  Dave"

A lot of land owners feel more comfortable letting you hunt thier land.  The patience you need to have is like no other.   Also with bows your season is a lot longer, and u can hunt in southern ontario where guns are not allowed for deer........  Thats where some true monster bucks roam"
