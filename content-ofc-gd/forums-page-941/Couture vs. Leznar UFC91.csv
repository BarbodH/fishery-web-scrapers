267774,jwl,2008-11-15 20:47:00,1056,"well we will find out tonight, heading out to the bar for some brews with the wife and watch the fight.  will be interesting, Lesnar is humungous, but has also had a broken neck before"
267779,PatrickGG,2008-11-15 20:59:00,562,"Couture Is gonna get his eggs scrambled a little but i think he will pull through, the only thing he's gonna have to watch out for is if Brock takes him to the ground i think once that happens Couture is gonna be stuck in his playground."
267809,BUSTER,2008-11-15 23:20:00,1336,never mind   erased
267812,misfish,2008-11-15 23:27:00,29133,"WHAT??????????Come on,"
267823,PatrickGG,2008-11-16 00:00:00,562,"  That Nose break was a fluke it was a weird collision when Couture was taking Gonzaga to the ground, that gave lead way for Couture and he took it to his advantage other than that it was Coutures fight regardless, Gonzaga is still upcoming and is gonna put on some good shows in the future, i still go in awe when i watch the kick he did on Mirko."
267827,BUSTER,2008-11-16 00:18:00,1336,ahh i was going to mention UFC 17 ...best to just google it..drinking beers already and after typing for what seemed like hrs i didnt have a clue what the point was in the first place so i erased it all....lol
267830,misfish,2008-11-16 00:27:00,29133, Im feeling yer pain.LOL Have a great night buster
267832,misfish,2008-11-16 00:28:00,29133, And that was not a fluke?????????????
267841,forrest,2008-11-16 01:00:00,1032,"Been a bad stressful day for me (trying to buy PC and   :blahblah1:    ).....I am looking forward to this fight.  Couture vs Lesnar: They have weight classes for a reason.  But, Couture has a ton of tricks and experience.  Too close to call!  forrest"
267850,charlesn,2008-11-16 01:21:00,551," Dude, are you saying Gonzaga was actually not trying to kick him in the head?  Sorta like how Randleman was not trying to punch his face off?  Maybe, just maybe, Crocop drops his guard once in a while and gets caught.  There is no fluke to it when a person dominates a fight (and Gonzaga WAS winning the fight before the KO) and then finishes it with a vicious head kick.  A fluke would be winning by KO when the fighter piledrives himself into the mat while trying to slam an opponent and knocks himself out like Mark Kerr did a few years back.  Or like when Shogun's arm popped while sprawling against Coleman.  Give Gonzaga credit.  I've seen every single fight Crocop fought in Pride and the UFC.  Crocop is a straight up phenomenal striker and good fighter.  But he got caught.  No ""fluke"" to it whatsoever.  Charles"
267852,misfish,2008-11-16 01:27:00,29133," Chuck,he couldnt reach that high. It deflected off of his shoulder. It was not a clean kick(he was even unballanced when he delivered it),yes it caught him,but it did not hit the mark like intended. FLUKE,LUCKY WHAT EVER.  Hey, hows the young ones? Im enjoying our little grandprincess."
267858,PatrickGG,2008-11-16 01:45:00,562," His intention was there regardless of his kick deflecting or him being off balance, Gonzaga threw that kick to do some sort of damage, as for what i was talking about earlier with Couture and Gonzaga it was more of a collision when couture took down Ganzaga, it wasnt Coutures intention to bust his nose in that fashion but it happened."

267938,Mattones,2008-11-16 04:50:00,587,"''Brock Lesnar and Randy Couture are both receiving $250,000 paydays for their much-anticipated fight tonight, according to the Los Angeles Times.  Additionally, Couture will get an additional $250,000 bonus should he win with Lesnar adding $200,000 more to his winnings should he win the fight.  UFC 91 airs tonight on pay per view with Couture/Lesnar being the main event for the UFC Heavyweight Championship. ''"
267946,steverowbotham,2008-11-16 05:27:00,1800,Told ya
267948,Mattones,2008-11-16 05:29:00,587,whatta know Randy lost. good fight.
267952,Cudz,2008-11-16 06:00:00,2652,Randy got caught.  He had a good game plan but got caught by a big guy.
267953,Mark Kulik,2008-11-16 06:07:00,348,"Thats excatly what happened -you see it in K-1 when Bob Sapp knocks out a guy like Ernesto Hoost skill wise no comparison, but when a guy that big hits you -goodnight!"
267961,danbo,2008-11-16 07:13:00,2646,
268015,ehg,2008-11-16 14:42:00,2666,"That about describes this, size and brute force beat skill and experience. Couture is 45 though, his time is over anyways."
268056,charlesn,2008-11-16 17:04:00,551,"I was very impressed with how patient Brock was.  He didn't bull rush or try anything too crazy.  The finish was awkward and not exactly pinpoint accurate striking, but I guess when someone of that size hits you, even glancing blows are damaging.  The punch caught him behind the ear on the top of the neck.  You don't see a lot of knockouts to that area, but as Randy said, ""that's one big dude"".  Brian, the rugrats are fine except for runny nose.  Cold season.  If you recall in the fight, Gonzaga had actually set Crocop up with some punishing kicks to the body.  If you watch, Crocop flinches down to block the body kick and Gonzaga throws high instead.  Gonzaga can definitely kick that high, he's a much taller bigger fighter.  I think if they fought 10 times, Gonzaga would win 7 of them if not more.  Crocop is a blown up light heavyweight.  Gonzaga is a true heavyweight and as we saw last night, the new wave of heavyweights is upon us.  Charles"
268058,dobee,2008-11-16 17:07:00,301,"wow, i won alot of money last night...tko rd 2 booyah!"
268060,steverowbotham,2008-11-16 17:14:00,1800,"I won 40 bucks, I'm happy enough with that.  Now I get to put it towards a new alternator for my truck. yay!"
267579,ehg,2008-11-15 00:47:00,2666,"Really, i can't tell who would win this. Couture has beaten alot of guys who were bigger than him and way younger, more skilled. He is 45 yrs. old though and Brock Leznar is a brute. Heck of a fight is gonna happen. I'm pulling for Couture"
267580,BUSTER,2008-11-15 00:48:00,1336,OOOOhh good post.......iam going for randy to teach brock some class
267581,steverowbotham,2008-11-15 00:49:00,1800,"As much as I'd like to see Couture win, I cant see it happening. Lesnar is too big and too strong."
267590,danbo,2008-11-15 01:17:00,2646,"I'll take the ""Natural"".. he's got family trouble on his mind though.."
267592,bucktail,2008-11-15 01:19:00,1857,"I hope Lesnar wins so he stays in MMA and gets his head beat in. This fight really dissapoints me and lowers UFC to WWE standards , Ill be up at RAMA on friday watching the molitor fight and not a circus."
267595,ehg,2008-11-15 01:31:00,2666,Feel the same way but still find this match intriguing. I think the whole Kimbo Slice thing really hurt organized MMA.
267596,dobee,2008-11-15 01:41:00,301,"how does this fight lower UFC standards??? Brock is a heavyweight contender... but...I dont think he should have a title fight so soon, many men go a couple years and countless fights before they are even considered a contender...  Now if Brock gets in the ring and grabs the mic and calls out randy and mir for a triple threat match....then maybe i would agree with you...  anyways...Brock is way too strong for randy. Randy has not fought in a year, ring rust will be a factor IMO. I say brock wins by TKO in second round..  Some great fights coming up in UFC!!"
267603,misfish,2008-11-15 02:08:00,29133,"Man you guys are so wacked. Lesnar will kick his Why,because he,s stronger,bigger and quicker younger. For the mans size,can you tell me another thats as quick as him. He dosent even need a ground game. He just pounds on ya.   Lesner in the first.   Yes he is,and the next champion."
267606,danc,2008-11-15 02:14:00,4677, Unless Couture gets a hold of Lesnars baby toe and wins submission. That's how he lost his first fight.
267610,BillM,2008-11-15 02:28:00,17367,Did people forget what Couture did to Silvia?  Lesnar is to big and to slow for his own good.  Randy is going to pick him apart...
267622,MCTFisher9120,2008-11-15 03:05:00,3761,Brock is going to win the fight thats it thats all.
267623,cplummer,2008-11-15 03:08:00,165,it will be an  easy slaughter for randy hands down..
267624,charlesn,2008-11-15 03:08:00,551,"Couture has two chances I figure, slim and none.  He has no submission game.  Name me one person he has finished by submission. GnP is all he has, and maybe he was a more decorated wrestler once, but he'll be giving up 40 lbs effectively on fight night and he's old an rusty.  I just don't know how he can win.  Lucky punch or Lesnar gassing, that's the only way I can see him pulling it off.  Then again, a lot of people said that about BHop versus Pavlik and BHop dominated.  Then again, Couture has risen against the odds before and manhandled way better strikers and bigger fighters in Gonzaga and Silvia.  If he can withstand the opening moments and bull rush, I think Lesnar will fade and make a mistake.  His cardio is touted as unreal and whatnot, but I don't know that it has ever been tested.  I am afraid there will be a lot of lay and pray if it doesn't end in a quick stoppage for Lesnar as neither fighter are much at finishing.  I hope I'm wrong, Randy Couture is a legend and an inspiration and I'd love to see him fight a strong jiu jitsu fighter like Big Nog or even Mir.  Charles"
267664,dobee,2008-11-15 13:52:00,301,"Brock is too slow????? lol brock is the quickest person i have seen at 265lbs.... the man has to cut weight to make heavyweight! I have honestly never seen a quicker true heavyweight...  Brock's 2nd fight ever was against a former heavyweight champ Frank Mir. He got caught with a submission by an excellent fighter... 90% of people who fight Frank Mir lose by submission....Him losing was no surprise, but he did prove how quick and powerful he was to take Mir down and almost stop the fight...  IMHO, randy will get the beat down... he is going to find how powerful Brock really is...   Brock for the win!!"
267676,Mark Kulik,2008-11-15 15:17:00,348,"True Couture has no submissions , but neither does Lesnar, both are wrestlers, G&P if Randy can use his conditioning and experience and get it into the 3rd + rounds he can pull it off -remember power is only good if youre not gassed, ask George Foreman!  1st 2 rounds I pick Lesnar -if it goes beyond Couture ground n pound.TKO 4th."
267690,misfish,2008-11-15 16:02:00,29133,   Morning Mark  I would say he does.  All Couture has to say is OK STOP POUNDING ME TO A PULP.
267696,steverowbotham,2008-11-15 17:16:00,1800,"Oh man  Randy destroyed Sylvia? Yes, he picked him apart, but he won that fight on the ground, he got inside got a leg trip and controlled it on the ground, he wont be able to do that to Brock. Brock Slow?  NO Brock next champ? For a few months, he will beat Couture and get subbed by Nogueira in the first round. Everyone keeps saing Couture will sub Brock. I highly doubt it, he has 2 submission wins in his career. He will work the clinch, which I dont see him being able to control.  He was an olympic alternate in greco roman wrstling, but Brock will be 55-60 pounds heavier come fight time, and an awesome wrestler.  If Couture wins this .... I will be in complete and utter shock, I will be very excited though.  I just see Brock dominating.  Brock is ever-improving as he continues to train.  He will be a HUGE force in MMA.  I hate when people say he's a joke because he was a WWE wrestler.  I hate WWE, but Brock Lesnar isn o longer a WWE wrestler.  He is a legitimate NCAA Div 1 Champion, hes not on roids, he does this all legitimately, yet he is hated because of his previous job. Come on, thats just immature."
267703,misfish,2008-11-15 18:03:00,29133,You make a great point Steve.
267704,danbo,2008-11-15 18:07:00,2646,"Brock is not hated.  He looks like ""Thor"" to me. He's a power-lifter/wrassler who could chew the ear off a Grizzly!"
267725,glirw,2008-11-15 18:45:00,200,"My money is on Randy Couture, because he is Randy Couture.  Randy's striking is more technical though less powerful  Randy's clinch is nasty  Randy is more used to being on his back than Brock  Randy's cardio even at 44 is superior to Brock's.  Randy by sheer experience in the 4th round."
267739,Mark Kulik,2008-11-15 19:05:00,348,"Remember the younger, stronger bigger , tougher Gonzaga? You can never count Couture out ! MMA anything can happen."
267743,Cudz,2008-11-15 19:08:00,2652,"Although I never want to bet against Couture, you can't overlook the fact that Lesnar controlled and overpowered Heath Herring, who is not a can.  If it goes to ground Couture has a chance to sub Lesnar.  We'll see.  Should be fun no matter what."
267754,ehg,2008-11-15 19:32:00,2666," If Lesnar wins this i would be shocked! Couture has way more experience with 15 minutes of this brutal mayhem.  That's why i initially posted this to get others opinion, which seem evenly split."
267756,steverowbotham,2008-11-15 19:37:00,1800," Remember when Gonzaga got his nose broken in the first round and could hardly breathe?  He was spitting out blood the whole fight and breathing with his mouth wide open.  He hates beign hit, and was bound to lose that fight"
267769,ecmilley,2008-11-15 20:39:00,2163,"I think it will be a intresting fight and for me I am looking at a 50:50  with expierence on one side and brutal fast power on the other. All I know is that tonight I'll be sitting in my living room with a case of keith's chilling in the fridge and watching it unfold on a 46"" plasma and thanking god it's not me in the ring with either of them"
