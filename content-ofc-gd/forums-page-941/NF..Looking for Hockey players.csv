267517,raysfish2005,2008-11-14 21:30:00,163,LOL  Nope its all about the beer after the game!!!!
267518,GBW,2008-11-14 21:34:00,8460,So it's ASHL Rec. level?
267520,raysfish2005,2008-11-14 21:38:00,163,Why yes it is  Wed night E division  Are you interested in drinking a beer with the boys ?
267523,GBW,2008-11-14 21:44:00,8460,If I was to pick up the stick again I'd be a bit closer to home back with my old team.  But thanks. I asked so others reading might now consider it.
267528,muskeybugged,2008-11-14 21:52:00,282,"I'd love to but I'm locked into a ASHL contract for this year.  Unrestricted Free Agent for next year.  You may be on to something here though .....  An all OFC hockey team!?!?!?!  The ""B"" word caught my interest!"
267556,nancur373,2008-11-14 23:09:00,1211,What does ASHL stand for?  Do you need a goalie?
267557,misfish,2008-11-14 23:20:00,29133, Well there goes the H2O guy. LOL
267675,chickenhawk,2008-11-15 15:08:00,612,i'd play if there was an all OFC team....lol heck i'd play if there was a team closer to my home...
267766,GBW,2008-11-15 20:37:00,8460,ASHL = Adult Safe Hockey League so there is little to no contact.
267783,raysfish2005,2008-11-15 21:13:00,163,"Hey Guys  Sorry we have a goalie, and most of the time there is no contact but stuff happens, as i said we play for the beer after the game.  ray"
267787,misfish,2008-11-15 21:38:00,29133," Yep,some forget we got to work in the morning.Reason why I got out. But am now looking at getting back into it. For the sport,,,,and the rewards after the game."
267855,steelhedrmatt,2008-11-16 01:37:00,278,"Try giving Iceguy a PM. He's in florida right now, but I know he's always looking for another night to play hockey."
