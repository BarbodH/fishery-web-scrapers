267046,NAC,2008-11-13 14:41:00,369,"Here is the one positive that did happen yesterday.     There was this slight problem in which one of Niagara's finest citizens decided to check out my truck without using a key, while I fished at the bottom of the gorge. Nothing of any monetary value was stolen, but my work briefcase for my ""real job"" was taken and of course it contained invaluable/irreplaceable documents for work! My fault for leaving it visible on the back seat of the truck. Another vehicle just down the road in another parking lot had reported a break in at the same time and there was absolutely nothing in it. I wish a long extended stay in a dank Ontario jail with cellmate ""Bubba"", to the culprit(s).  Anyway..... we fished for just under 2hrs, landed one fish, fought two others and missed about a dozen on the hooksets. Aside from the one expensive/negative event, it was an excellent two hour outing. As for tactics, it really didn't matter as the fish hit every colour and size of roe bag we threw at them under our floats."

267059,DANIMAL,2008-11-13 15:04:00,215,Nice Niagara steel. I hear that area is bad for vehicle break-ins. Its a shame that its not safe to leave things in a locked car.
267060,BillM,2008-11-13 15:05:00,17367,"Wow, is that ever a green fish!  Awesome colours on that male..  I'd love to find someone in the act of breaking into my car, the things I would do...."
267062,PatrickGG,2008-11-13 15:12:00,562,"Nice Steele, sorry to hear about the break in, it sux when your out to release some stress fishing to only finish up and become more stressed when your all done."
267072,fisher,2008-11-13 15:36:00,451,"I wonder if putting an OPP hat on the dash, or even a decal on the window would keep them away from tampering with your car.  Otherwise just keep the door unlocked and leave nothing valuable inside.   nice fish."
267075,jwl,2008-11-13 15:40:00,1056,"nice fish...that really sucks about the break in though, unfortunately it is an annual story at times, best to to leave nothing visible in your vehicle..the   's know they have lots of time down there"
