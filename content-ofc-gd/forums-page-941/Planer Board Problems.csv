I took them out to test and at 2mph and 50' of line out...the boards seem to be to dragging and to far back not out to the sides. I was on another boat & his boards went out to the sides very well. Have I assembled them incorrectly...is the pull screw to far back. They have an offset of 4"" with a 30 degree bevel on the tips. They are 9"" apart..28"" long made of red cedar...float very well.  Any ideas would be a great help.  Thanks  "

267295,outllaw,2008-11-14 02:16:00,1232,from what i see your pull screw is to far back. whats the distance between skis. i normally weight my boards at the rear lower of each skie. .. at slower speeds boards normally drag back just a little.
267535,brifishrgy,2008-11-14 22:07:00,559, I would say you are too close to the front .. think of it like a kite .. if the kite rope was in the front it wouldnt fly .. put the rope in the middle and it lifts almost straight up .. I would move the pull screw a few inches back
