268078,steelhead hunter,2008-11-16 18:07:00,152,All jimmy has to do is finish like 36th or some thing like that so I'm pretty shure he will win it
268095,Canuck2fan,2008-11-16 18:42:00,1444,"I am a big Edwards fan but Jimmie seems to have it all in his favor. Cheater Chad will have all sorts of tricks up that sleeve of his. Besides if need be every Hendrick car or Hendrick powered car would just finish behind Jimmie to give him the ""historic"" 3 in a row.  I bet you though that Carl puts on one heck of a show LOL"
268112,danc,2008-11-16 19:16:00,4677,"Jimmie's car wasn't set up for qualifying, so he's starting 30th. In yesterdays practices he was first and fourth. He's good to go now. Watch for him to be in the top 10 by lap 50 or so."
268118,misfish,2008-11-16 19:22:00,29133,"Hey, you woke up. I knew you wouldnt miss the race.LOL  I sure would like to see jr,win this one."
268196,Bernie,2008-11-16 23:24:00,3190,Anything could happen yet!
268214,Handlebarz,2008-11-17 00:20:00,3790,Miss the race no we would not all set sitting eating nacho chips and then the good Ol Express view kicks out thanks to mother nature we have some snow around and no RACE WHAT THE yep its been two hours and no race this sucks.
268216,misfish,2008-11-17 00:38:00,29133,"Jimmy wins I cannot believe what I just seen. Man ,a 18 sec lead then down to 14 then 10. Carl did a great job.  OK, now Im going to say this. JR will be Champion next year.   Enjoy yer party Dan."
268311,fishdawg,2008-11-17 03:22:00,912,"wow 3 in a row for the ""other"" California Kid  im a huge Jimmy fan, but i do hope now that Jimmy & Jeff have had had there Glory, that its Jr's turn to finally be a serious threat  still dont really get why they signed Martin... ive got nothing against the guy at all, but really does he actually think he really has a chance at winning a race or two, let alone making the chase?  good thing about NASCAR though is the relatively short ""off-season"""
