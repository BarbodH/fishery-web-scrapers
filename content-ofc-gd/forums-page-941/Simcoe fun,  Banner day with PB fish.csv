267866,Cudz,2008-11-16 01:54:00,2652,"Back in the late 80s I used to catch a few largies and even the odd pike just out from Tiffen launch. I too thought it might be the tournament releases sticking around the bay.  I used to catch a bunch of small 10"" smallies from the shore (in front of south shore center before it was there) so maybe they have since grown up reproduced etc.  Either way I won't ever complain about having world a class smallmouth fishery in my back yard."
267870,Leecher,2008-11-16 02:02:00,7832,Great report and awesome pics Cudz Congratulation on your PB Man what a massive bronze back  Thanks for sharing Leechman
267871,Marty,2008-11-16 02:03:00,873,Way to go.   Those are some great fish. Thanks for sharing.
267919,Radnine,2008-11-16 03:45:00,1538,Awesome fish! But even dogs know enough to get in out of the rain. Little wonder you are letting them de-index your pension! Seriously man they are nothing short of stunning. Care to let us in on the lure de-jour?
267716,Cudz,2008-11-15 18:23:00,2652,"Despite the rain and wind I managed to get out on Simcoe for some fall smallmouth action.  A north wind allowed me to drift fish perfectly.  Got on the water at 7:30 am and by 8:30 I had 3 already in the boat.  Despite fishing for smallies for 20+ years, my PB until now has been about 4.5 pounds.  Today that changed.  I beat that PB 3 times.  My first fish of the day was 5.3 pounds.  My second fish was 3.2 pounds.  My big fish of the day was a monster.  Acording to my scale it was exactly 7.0 pounds.  My last fish came about 1 hour later and weighed in at 5.8 pounds.  All the fish were VERY fat.  The pictures might not do them justice but they were very thick indeed.  That big fish had a huge girth and it measured very close to 22"".  You have to be very aware of your bait at all times because all the strikes were very subtle.  I lost 2 other fish as well. All in all a very fun morning.  I got off the water at 11:30 am.  3.2 pounder   5.3 pounder   5.8 pounder   7.0 pounder   7.0 again "

267736,Mark Kulik,2008-11-15 19:02:00,348,Nice smallies Chris!
267738,Cudz,2008-11-15 19:05:00,2652,"Hey Mark, Thanks for the tips that make this possible"
267741,misfish,2008-11-15 19:06:00,29133,"HAHAHAHAHA You,ll have every angler there now. Stupid back ground.LOL  AWESOME FISH. WTG"
267744,Cudz,2008-11-15 19:10:00,2652,LOL!  yeah if you are from here you already know.  I don't mind as the Extreme Agler show already filmed there last year.
267745,misfish,2008-11-15 19:10:00,29133,"Oh meant to add a comment about yer bass boat,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,NOT REQUIRED. The bass boat that is.LOL    I cant get over that 7. SWEET."
267748,Cudz,2008-11-15 19:15:00,2652,Yeah it is pretty sweet.  Almost 12' with about a 4' beam.  Leaks like mad and is very tippy.  Powered by a 6hp Yammy.  Nice rig. lol.  Got everything for free except the rod holders that I bought from BPS for $10.  I also spent about $20 on stainless nuts and bolts and $5 for some wood to beef up the transom.  I also have a homemade trailer (free and ungly) and the tow vehicle is a 1985 Ford f150 on its last legs.  Who says teachers make too much money?
267752,johnnyb,2008-11-15 19:25:00,3413,Shee-ooot!  nice bass!!!
267757,steverowbotham,2008-11-15 19:39:00,1800,"Nice job man thats awesome.  I never fished it when I lived 5 mins away, now I'm 2 hours away and struggle for gas money to tow the boat there"
267760,335396,2008-11-15 20:08:00,16,Awesome teacher.
267764,ehg,2008-11-15 20:34:00,2666,Wow! You know how to get the big smallies there. I still remember that super fat fish one of your students caught. Thanks for sharing these. ehg

267771,GBW,2008-11-15 20:43:00,8460,"all of them are nice fish, good job."
267776,Mark Kulik,2008-11-15 20:50:00,348,"Happy to help Chris, its not so much the boat as fishing properly for the conditions, I had a 16 ft tinn with a 60 hp for 15 yrs, before I got into tourneys, when I retireI'll probably go back to an 18 ft alum."
267777,misfish,2008-11-15 20:54:00,29133,"Oh come on,you retire??????????  If you do,you will only need a 12 ft,er. Yer only a small guy,,,,,,,,,,Oh wait,you,ll still have a hundred rods or so still.LMAO.  Mark you help out alot of people. CUDOS TO YOU SIR."

267801,modny,2008-11-15 22:40:00,502,those 7lbers are slobs  nice petit la bouche'
267849,Cudz,2008-11-16 01:18:00,2652,I know what you mean.  I grew up here and never fished it either.  I used to always make the trip to cook's bay.  I moved back after being away for 15 years and now I find that the smallies are right here in my back yard.  I wonder if they have always been here or is it a recent phenomenon?  Anyone know if they always came in during the fall season even back in the late 80s early 90s?
267856,Greencoachdog,2008-11-16 01:43:00,8163,Excellent effort braving the elements for those beautiful fish!!!
