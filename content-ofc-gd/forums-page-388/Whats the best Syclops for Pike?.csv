712550,hotsky,2012-07-07 19:51:00,400,I like Mepps Syclops lures because of how far you can cast them. What in your experience is the best colour for pike?  Thanks.
712552,Rich Clemens,2012-07-07 19:54:00,3131,"Can't say I had a favorite color, but I would troll for pike when we fished the Rideau system and had great success with them over the weeds."

712556,kickingfrog,2012-07-07 20:25:00,8333,"For pike, in particular, colour is way down on my list when it comes to choosing a lure. Having said that, if you have confidence in a particular colour why mess with it. Silver and/or perch."

712653,Dabluz,2012-07-08 04:58:00,701,I like the yellow ones.
712723,davey buoy,2012-07-08 17:25:00,5505,"I have a #3 orange and yellow I haven't tried yet,silver back thou. Let you know next weekend.!"
712724,northernpike56,2012-07-08 17:39:00,717,I have a silver one. only tried it out a few times but I caught a decent pike trolling it over a weedbed
712733,Fisherpete,2012-07-08 18:40:00,1814,"Firetiger, gold and silver have all produced well for me. I swap out the hooks though for slightly bigger gamakatsus.  Peter"
712734,kickingfrog,2012-07-08 18:45:00,8333,"I prefer to use a siwash hook. A plastic grub trailer can help the ""weedlessness"" and gives the bait some lift so you can work it slower without it getting into the weeds."
712783,NAW,2012-07-08 22:19:00,4022,Different colors for different lakes.  I always start with fire tiger.
