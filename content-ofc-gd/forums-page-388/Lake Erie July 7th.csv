Wedding in august, selling and buying houses and work just eat into your fishing time something terrible  Yesterday we got the chance to get out fishing with H20 operator on Erie, not passing that up. Fantastic day on the water, bow was first in the cooler followed by the 2 smaller eyes.  It went quiet for abit and just as we were going to pack it in, the three bigger eyes hit one after the other in the space of 10 minutes.      Its was very hot, but great company, some good laughs and stories, the fish were just an added bonus. I am still amazed by the number of flies biting your legs to shreds when you are 10 miles out  Next up  - August 22nd marlin fishing in Cancun."
