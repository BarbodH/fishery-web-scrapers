712622,Christopheraaron,2012-07-08 01:08:00,3525,"Well today was the first day of my tournament in orangeville, as everyone noticed  the conditions were less than ideal. After being stuck doing nothing until 10 the bit had already cooled off. No one really caught anything, talked to some others and they only boated 1 26"" pike, and I only managed a two pound bass (2 pounds back of the lead). Any tips for tomorrow?"
712624,Handlebarz,2012-07-08 01:12:00,3790,Have you tried slowing down like going old school 5 of diamonds or red devil? Large and slow. I'm just guessing you have already been using spinnerbaits and crank baits with rattles
712627,Christopheraaron,2012-07-08 01:33:00,3525,"The  bass was actually caught on a lipless crank, we tried the daredevils and diamonds and my dad caught 3 giant sunfish on them, I would go bigger but I lost my last large daredevil at the conestoga dam last week. I have tried spinnerbaits, pitching jigs (caught a rockbass on), husky jerks, frogs, spoons, crankbaits, and spinners. I think that somehow we overlooked the senkos a bit so we'll be using them tomorrow along with some live minnows, other than that any suggestions?"

712632,Canuck2fan,2012-07-08 01:57:00,1444,If you can use live bait hit a creek on the same lake and grab some crawfish and hang on.... Check out the thread on how to catch them. If you can't find crawfish grab some live leeches from a fishing store. With either bait where you know the bass are just toss them out a hook no weight of any kind leave the bail open and let the bass take them for a run when the bass stops KEEP waiting when the line moves the bas is committed set the hook.

712727,northernpike56,2012-07-08 17:51:00,717,"SENKOS!!!! I like black or watermelon/red fleck 5"" for LMB and 3-4"" for SMB."
712737,Christopheraaron,2012-07-08 19:09:00,3525,"Well tournament is over, didnt place, we tried all of your suggestions ( thanks again ) the winning fish came in at 5.2 pounds, we caught lots of good fish but none good enough to win. We had a great time and will be back, we are now barreling toward the 400 to head up to barrie we are looking to do a little shore fishing for smallmouth there we were thinking of kempenfelt park, sound like a good plan? Thanks!"
712740,davey buoy,2012-07-08 19:27:00,5505, Good as any!
712742,misfish,2012-07-08 19:37:00,29133,"You missed the good bite this morning. 7/ 2-3 lb  smallies on a fly rod with a  popper, at 5 am til 6:30am."
712764,Christopheraaron,2012-07-08 20:52:00,3525,"We're at centennial, hope it warms up!"
712805,Christopheraaron,2012-07-08 23:37:00,3525,"1 goby for kempenfelt. Oh well, at least I have the home run derby tomorrow."
712806,bare foot wader,2012-07-08 23:45:00,1354,"not familiar with the lake, but next time i'd check the water temp, bass get sluggish in the heat of the summer...look for structure around deep water, target the thermocline and when you believe in a spot sit on it and work it over  suspending a chub below a float always works for the big boys"
