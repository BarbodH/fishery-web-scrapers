712563,Spiel,2012-07-07 20:43:00,9065,"I've been slowly working on a special build for member Floatman55 and have now finished it.  A little more involved than most of my builds in terms of handle/seat construction and the inclusion of two colours of metallic thread. The pictures don't show it clearly but it starts with three turns of gold metallic, three turns silver metallic, 6 turns black, one turn silver, six more black then one more gold then finish in black.         "
712564,misfish,2012-07-07 20:56:00,29133,"I really like that Chris. Very nice work. Im sure glad I got mine.Floatman55 will be very impressed I,m sure. Only a few months to get at it again.  What guides did you use?"
712566,Handlebarz,2012-07-07 20:59:00,3790,awesome work again for sure
712568,Rattletrap2,2012-07-07 21:10:00,1652,Beautiful workmanship Chris. That rod will be treasured for many years to come.
712577,BucktownAngler,2012-07-07 21:47:00,582,"yous should do some step by step pics, so we can see what kind of work goes into a nice rod like that"
712581,esoxansteel,2012-07-07 22:01:00,1307,"Very nice build Chris, keeping the colors in the correct order, and number of trim band turns, would have confused me for sure, very nice blank float man chose as well."
712592,Bill Shearer,2012-07-07 22:48:00,456,"This is build #4, that Chris has done for me, and they just keep getting better! He went way beyond the norm, and it's much appreciated. His attention to details, as well as his expertise, dictates that the best he can do is what you get, each and every time. I should add that the reel seat that was turned for this rod, was provided by John Collina, from Caledonia, ON.  This rod will definitely be treasured by me for many years to come."
712609,Ralph Field,2012-07-07 23:52:00,1018,"A truly beautiful rod that will land many,many fish in the coming years."
712613,misfish,2012-07-07 23:59:00,29133," Cripes,,,,,,,,,,,,it took me many years to give in for my first. He does do great work. Once I have a full fall run with my build.I,ll be ordering my set reel butt section."

712694,spinnerdoc,2012-07-08 13:36:00,556,Nicely done Chris. Who made the reel seat? The manufacturer I mean. As always a classy build by an outsatnding builder.
712703,Spiel,2012-07-08 14:14:00,9065,"Thanks for the kind words folks.    Alps       I'd like too, but as I hold and turn all rods by hand I'd need a third hand to take the pictures.    My bad, though I did mention that in a previous post when I was constructing the handle.    Glad to hear it Bernie.    The hardware is Struble Edwin."
712709,spinnerdoc,2012-07-08 14:54:00,556,Thanks Chris.The blank is awesome. Had the chance to give it a good work out last fall and this spring.

712886,John,2012-07-09 11:47:00,2956,"Awesome Chris, simply awesome!...  As you know I'm not a big fan of coloured threads on rods and this one is pretty much perfect and almost identical to how I would order it.  Wish it was mine.."
713340,Spiel,2012-07-10 15:52:00,9065,"Thanks again guys, much appreciated.  Floatman55 was in this morning to pick up the rod and left very happy and that of course makes me happy. Thanks Mr. Floatman."
