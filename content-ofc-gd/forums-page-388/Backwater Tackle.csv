We went musky fishing to Midland harbour 7 or 8 years ago and seeing as we'd never fished there before we stopped into Backwater to ask a few questions. Not only did Brian give us some  advice, he even loaned us one of his good laminated maps and marked some good spots on it for us. He said to just leave it outside when we got back as he'd be gone home by then.  Not alot of guys would help strangers like that."
