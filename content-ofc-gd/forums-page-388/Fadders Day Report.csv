I've not had a lot of fishing time the past while. Despite the threat of stormy weather, we puttered around on the electric, tossing at every potential pikey looking spot. We weren't disappointed. I can now do some BBQ pike and moujakka,   4 Hours was all the body could handle at that point, but I was happy with the 1/2 dozen we caught.  The daughter opted out of the little adventure as her foot was in another cast.  No pain"
