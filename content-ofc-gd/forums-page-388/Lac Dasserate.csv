We did very well and it was a nice trip to a semi-wilderness location. You can drive right to the camp if you have a half decent truck, I'm glad I didn't take my Ranger though. Mike's Outfitters was a great destination and Mike and Johanne were wonderful hosts. Anyone would have a great time there. The target species were walleye, pike and anything else that would bite! LOL We mainly targetted walleye and had no trouble finding fish in the 1 - 1 1/2 lb range, with only a few over 2 1/2.  The pike were found throughout the lake and largest we caught was 38"". The best part that I liked about the lake was that the visibility was low and we could fish for walleye all day long with no problems from the sun. Lost site of the lure about 3 feet down. We had an amazing fish fry one night and all the guys couldn't stuff enough into their bellies. Check out Mike's Outfitters online. Here are a couple of pics.  http://i1180.photobucket.com/albums/x415/jimmer5/Mikes%20Outfitters%202012/2012-06-3001-26-46_0011.jpg  http://i1180.photobucket.com/albums/x415/jimmer5/Mikes%20Outfitters%202012/2012-06-3003-15-30_0013.jpg  http://i1180.photobucket.com/albums/x415/jimmer5/Mikes%20Outfitters%202012/2012-06-3019-55-52_0017.jpg  http://i1180.photobucket.com/albums/x415/jimmer5/Mikes%20Outfitters%202012/2012-07-0109-09-00_0025.jpg  http://i1180.photobucket.com/albums/x415/jimmer5/Mikes%20Outfitters%202012/2012-07-0121-33-54_0050.jpg  http://i1180.photobucket.com/albums/x415/jimmer5/Mikes%20Outfitters%202012/2012-07-0209-22-55_0059.jpg  http://i1180.photobucket.com/albums/x415/jimmer5/Mikes%20Outfitters%202012/2012-07-0210-15-01_0061.jpg I think this little guy might be a sauger My buddy/fishing partner got the largest pike and walleye for the trip, so he gets immortalized on the trophies."
