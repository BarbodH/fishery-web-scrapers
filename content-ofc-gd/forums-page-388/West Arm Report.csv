712971,BucktownAngler,2012-07-09 17:21:00,582,"Spent Candada Day week up at Memquisit Lodge with Mr. Mike, Grew, one lurking buddy and a non-member.  We were mostly targeting Musky & Bass, with the occasional walleye for dinner. The musky were hard to find, we didnt even get a follow. We might need to bring Lew along next time to show us the spots.  Caught some smaller pike on musky baits, but thats about it.  On to the pics, all taken with cellphones, but most turned out ok  Groceries for the trip. Lots of looks and nosey people at No frills lol    Heres our cabin up at Memquisit, we got the biggest one they had, plenty of room for 6 guys, although we did have to bring up 300ft of extension cords to charge the batteries for the front mounts at night    Bass were on fire in the evening, decent in the morning, and pretty much dead mid-day Most of these bass pics are in the evening          Morning Smallie that took a nice hit from something big       More Evening bass, Some double header action too.                     And some more bass                   Mr. Mike with a trophy     Goose with some nice bass & sheepshead           Sliver pike, caught trolling      some scenery & misc. pics (some of my new wallpapers)                              some panoramic shots i took on my phone                  "

712996,Millhouse2020,2012-07-09 18:27:00,152,Great report!  It makes me want to head out there ASAP.  I have never targeted large mouth in the west arm before but I'm thinking I should try...
712998,Rod Caster,2012-07-09 18:32:00,5784,you have enough bass there to fill up a 50lbs musky!

713013,BucktownAngler,2012-07-09 19:01:00,582," i would go back for sure, maybe at a later time of year though. It was hot as hell!  we shouldve brought up some fans for the cabin."
713056,misfish,2012-07-09 20:19:00,29133,"Thats some great bass,n guys. Well done."
713100,Roy,2012-07-09 21:37:00,13728,Really good report Boss. You got enough bass too! Those pads look like surface bait heaven. Memquisit is a nice place. I've never stayed there but I've fished near it often and have heard very good reports about the place. It's for sale (along with a bunch of other places) if anyone is interested. It wouldn't take much to put me over the investor's line.
713108,shimano19,2012-07-09 21:52:00,196,those are some nice bass you got there Boss. looks like a good time
