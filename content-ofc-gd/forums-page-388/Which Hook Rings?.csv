712979,Luke V.,2012-07-09 17:41:00,286,"Was fishing on Erie as I do every weekend.  Throwing cranks. Specifically a Clanking rap in Perch      Pulled it out of the package brand new. Inspected the hooks, all seemed good. Throw the bait 4-5 times, landed a smallie around 1.5 pounds. Keep throwing it. Get a good 4 pounder on, get it near the boat to net it. As i reach for the net (was by myself) it jumps and comes off. No biggy I thought. Until I noticed my rear trebble was missing. Then on closer inspection the hook ring was missing too. Anyone have this happen to them? I have been using similar style cranks for a few years. Never seen this happen before.  What hook rings do you use?  Thanks, Tight Lines  Luke"

712994,Luke V.,2012-07-09 18:14:00,286,I just looked at their website. They seem to have some very nice stuff. Thanks for the tip!
713014,glen,2012-07-09 19:05:00,2641,How heavy of line were you using?  The split rings should be good for up to 10lb line.  Maybe you just had a bad split ring.
713022,Luke V.,2012-07-09 19:21:00,286,"I am running 20lb power pro. And i just re spooled the reel. Im think that it was just a bad split ring. Seems like ill be getting some new ones, and spending the afternoon changing out most of them:whistling:"
