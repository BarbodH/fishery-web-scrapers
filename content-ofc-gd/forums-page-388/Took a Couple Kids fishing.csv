712741,bigbuck,2012-07-08 19:35:00,2449,On Friday we had one of our neighbours come up with his two boys aged 5 and 3 to HH. His oldest rode without training wheel for the first time. We hit a little secluded beach I know for a bit before heading back to drown a couple of worms. The youngest caught a sunfish and small perch quickly before his big brother caught a decent worlds greatest sportfish (rock bass). The kids had a ton of fun with my girls and it was great to help a couple of young boys catch their first fish.
