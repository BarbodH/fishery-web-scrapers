713406,shane,2012-07-10 18:33:00,652,Hi guys. Thinking of going fishing at Port Dover this Friday.  Any suggestions?
713408,Live2fish85,2012-07-10 18:35:00,1633,Don't bother. You can't even get in the town with a car unless you have a resident pass. You will have to take a bus or walk a couple miles and on tip of that the pier and entire town will be arm to arm for Friday the 13th.
713419,shane,2012-07-10 18:53:00,652,"HAHA! Yeah, I'm just being funny. I know what's going on there this Friday. I won't be going anywhere near the place."
713432,Live2fish85,2012-07-10 19:34:00,1633,Lol I was thinking everyone should know about it lol.  I will be there most likely.

713499,Rich,2012-07-10 21:45:00,3927,Try the pier. If you play it just right with some barbless hooks I`m sure you can get some hungry bikini tops
