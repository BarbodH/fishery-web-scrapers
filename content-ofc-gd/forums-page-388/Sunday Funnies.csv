What's for supper?""  ""WHHHAAAAAT?!? You sit on your butt in the air conditioning all day while I'm out here working?!? I can't believe you have the balls to ask me about supper right now! ""Tell you what -- imagine I'm out of town. Go inside and figure out dinner for yourself!""  Old Dave went back in the house and fixed himself a big steak with potatoes, garlic bread, and a tall glass of old beer.  Wifey finally finished the lawn and walked in about the time he was finishing up. ""You fixed something to eat, I see. So where's mine?""  ""Huh? I thought you were out of town."""
