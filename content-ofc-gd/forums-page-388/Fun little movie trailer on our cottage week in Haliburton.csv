713477,mirogak,2012-07-10 20:56:00,387,"Thanks guys. I was cottaging on Benoir lake at the southern tip of my fav Algonquin Park.  I took some day trips into the park and checked out High Falls (that was freakin' beautiful), I will post a video on that place.  The weather was just awesome all 5 days I was up there.  Unfortunately for me, I decided not to focus too much on fishing and spend more time with the girls and my parents.  Took'em hiking and boating and stuff like that.  So yeah, I didn't get to fish much besides dock fishing with the girls for perch and rock basses.  Still fun though.  Miro"
