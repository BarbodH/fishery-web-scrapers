712682,Garry2Rs,2012-07-08 13:01:00,1425,"Fuji New Concept Guides have been around for a few years.  The basic idea is a scientific guide lay-out to get the line, coming off the reel, under control quickly.  This gives the angler longer casts.  There are a number of formulas to calculate this guide layout, but at a spot, roughly 27 times the diameter of the reel spool, there will be a guide that is often called ""the choker guide.""  All line wobble will stop at this point and the line will flow straight and smoothly out the rod tip.  This works best on a custom made rod, where the exact reel that will be used, and it's spool size are known.  The latest development is a guide that also reduces tangles and furthers the gains made through using the New Concept.  Over the last year Fuji has introduced the ""K"" series of guides.  Some custom builders and a couple of rod companies, like Rapala Canada are using these new guides, However the whole idea and how it all works might be a little fuzzy to most folks.  Since the Inmates here at OFC are among the best informed anglers around, I thought some of you might like to see this video from Fuji.
