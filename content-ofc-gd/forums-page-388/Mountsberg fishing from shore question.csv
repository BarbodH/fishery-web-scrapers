I was wondering if it's easier to find a good spot on the other side (where I guess you have to go thru the gates in the conservation area?)  Also hows the fishing on the east part of the lake after the tracks? I walked over there and noticed the water was very still and murky. Figured would be a good for bullhead, but not pike or an I wrong?  Thanks"
