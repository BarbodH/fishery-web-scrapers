712238,bushart,2012-07-06 17:03:00,2628,My Boy was Cleaning a bass today----get down to the tail section---and this pops out of the meat  Not the guts---it was in the meat at the tail section---you can see the indent where it was  The brown gross lookin thing was it---I'm guessin a tumour of sorts  Anyway---never seen that before---and I've cleaned  what seems like a Cajillion fish over the years  
712240,Rod Caster,2012-07-06 17:05:00,5784,Must be a one in a cajillion event.  Fry it up.... can't taste all that bad if you dip it in butter
712243,kickingfrog,2012-07-06 17:14:00,8333,"Ya could be a tumour, or maybe a foreign object that a mass formed around?"
712244,bushart,2012-07-06 17:20:00,2628,  I was wonderin about that   not sure how something would get in tail section though??
712247,Roy,2012-07-06 17:25:00,13728," Mash it with a few drops of linseed oil, a little burnt umber and a dab of van dyck and you've got an incredible backdrop for creek bottoms."
712252,bushart,2012-07-06 17:29:00,2628,  Good idea---may be just a little too homegrown for this painter though
712273,hookerdown,2012-07-06 18:44:00,110,Send the pic to the MNR they might know what it is.
712278,Billy Bob,2012-07-06 18:53:00,5865,"Your lucky that's all you found in a ""bass""......"

712296,Governator,2012-07-06 19:25:00,879,A little bit of vomit came up my throat.
712301,Pigeontroller,2012-07-06 19:37:00,2793,ITS NOT A TUMOR!
712304,bushart,2012-07-06 19:40:00,2628,Re: Bass  I don't eat pike  I like to eat Largemouth better than walleye---I may have eaten too many walleyes in my life  Smallies are good---can be a bit stronger taste  and of course trout go without sayin
712305,bushart,2012-07-06 19:41:00,2628,  What could it be??---remembering it was a ways away from the guts
712314,kickingfrog,2012-07-06 20:05:00,8333," Maybe if it was said with a think Austrian accent.  ""It's not a toomah"""
712372,spincast,2012-07-06 23:11:00,3279,bass with prostate cancer....................?
712435,Spiel,2012-07-07 12:52:00,9065,"I had something similar, actually nearly exact (double in size) in a Lake Erie Walleye, in about the same area of the flesh too! Not very appetizing......""GAG"""
712674,MCTFisher9120,2012-07-08 12:49:00,3761,  That is discusting
712676,Roy,2012-07-08 12:52:00,13728, Best line so far.
712755,highdrifter,2012-07-08 20:28:00,2534,Flesh eating disease!!
712830,bucktail,2012-07-09 01:57:00,1857,Might be from an old injury that has healed over.
712834,ChrisK,2012-07-09 02:10:00,2772,Looks like he was growing his brain in his behind
