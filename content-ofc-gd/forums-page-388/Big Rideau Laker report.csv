Ian joined me earlier this year for his first Laker outing and we had a blast, caught lots of fish and even boated a tanker.  6am I met Ian at his place and we loaded his gear and off we went, a short 1.25 hr drive and we met our bud Dan at the launch, Dan would be fishing with his boat and his 5yr old son Ryan.  Strategy was to jig up some lakers from a few of Dans honey holes, with a backup of downrigging if the jig didn't produce.  After 1.5 hrs of jigging, with one small one caught on the drop and seeing on the sonar that the Lakers were not on bottom, we switched to trolling.   Amy's first Laker, and a nice one at that!   Ians  6.5lber, we need to work on the hold lol   A decent eater!  We went 4 for 10, kept 3 and let a small one back to the water. We had 3 really nice ones up to within sight of the boat but weren't able to keep them from shaking the hooks,  Still an awesome day, Amy got her first Laker and Ian almost beat his pb! Dan and his son limited out in about 2.5hrs and left for home.  Not bad for 4 hrs fishing"
