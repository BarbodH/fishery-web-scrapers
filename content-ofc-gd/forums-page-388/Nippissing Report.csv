712782,Scott S,2012-07-08 22:04:00,203,"Just got back from spending a week up at Callendar with the family. Fishing was up and down. One day it was jigs the next day it was spinner rigs. The wind made it hard to fish a couple of days. Caught alot of walleye all sizes, biggest was 26incher, also caught some real nice smallies and only 2 sheephead witch is unusual. :dunno:Here are a couple of pics from the week. attachment=19060:cottage 154.jpg  Scooter"
