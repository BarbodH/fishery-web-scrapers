It's close to home and to be honest, I don't fish Nipissing as much as I should....so I took the opportunity today.  I put out a few texts and eventually I found a paddling partner. It was fairly windy when we arrived at the lake, so we decided to paddle all the way to the weedbed, then drift back to the launch.  Third cast put me on a walleye, followed by a couple sheep and then a nice big 'eye to round things out. My partner didn't have as much luck but managed a nice bass...he also lost a BIG smallmouth right at the boat. ""time to learn a better knot!"".   As we drifted back, we left the ""hot spot"" and the bites stopped, but it was a nice night so we enjoyed the weather and chatted a bit. A few wgsf later...and it was time to call it a day.                      "
