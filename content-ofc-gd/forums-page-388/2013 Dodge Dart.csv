713159,danbouck,2012-07-09 23:21:00,4380,it looks like a new Dodge
713169,pikehunter,2012-07-09 23:55:00,1659,"NOPE!  Why do they want to put a Dart badge on that? Put anything other name on it, don't try to convince us that is a dart. Just plain stupid."
713175,NAW,2012-07-10 00:12:00,4022,That's brutal.  Totally expected to see something different when I clicked on that link.
713226,fish_fishburn,2012-07-10 02:46:00,1311,What a piece of crap.
713229,Muskieman,2012-07-10 02:55:00,2472,it's a Mitsubishi Lancer EVO ... that easy  every new FWD Mopar has a Japanese twin .... with that said so does every other domestic FWD ( Japanese or Euro twin )
713230,danc,2012-07-10 02:56:00,4677,"So glad that I'm not into cool vehicles. It's got to be the most expensive hobby on the planet. My rides are beasts of burdens to me, nothing more. And they still cost me a small fortune."
713231,GreenCanada,2012-07-10 03:20:00,375,"Not impressed what so ever with this new Dart. It just looks like a carbon copy of many previous models of Dodge sedans.  Wouldn't touch the new Dart, let alone many other vehicles offered by North American brands. They just haven't been comparable to the quality of overseas vehicle brands I've looked at over the past few years. Just my opinion.  The whole ""support our economy"" argument holds little weight as other typically oversea brands now have factories in the US or Canada."
713241,BillM,2012-07-10 04:22:00,17367," The EVO and the new Dart are nothing a like.  Completely different platforms, engine, suspension etc etc.  The Dart actually uses the same platform as the Alfa Romeo Giulietta."
713248,OhioFisherman,2012-07-10 06:06:00,6623,"Catchy name, I wonder how big a bonus the dude that thought of it gave himself?"
713250,pikehunter,2012-07-10 07:30:00,1659,"  I can picture it. Bunch of suits sitting at a board room table, caviar and smoked salmon treats and they're all sittting there and one of them pipes in, ""What we gonna call this piece of crap?"" Guy at the other end jumps up, ""DART, That's it, the Dodge Dart, genious! "" For our Next topic of the day shall we vote on a bonus for old Cedric there for coming up with that original name tag?""  Ay Ay, and the first one off the line goes to Cedric too! Let's toast to this wonderous occasion!  What a shame."
713266,Harrison,2012-07-10 12:08:00,2202,"Wow, talk about mis-branding.  What a dud, I was disappointed.  My Gramps had a dart, a real one.  Not the fart like this."
713268,craigdritchie,2012-07-10 12:25:00,1586,"Thing is, they will probably sell a gazillion of the things. There really aren't a lot of options out there for someone who wants to buy new, who wants a sporty looking car, and who doesn't want to blow a whole pile of dough. Challenger, Camaro and Mustang are all far more expensive cars. Even a Mits Evo will still cost more than the Dart.  Remember the old Chev Cavalier Z24? This is the modern version.  Remember, the target market for this vehicle has never even seen a 60s/70s Dart, much less driven one. They won't make the comparison."
713269,Bernie,2012-07-10 12:29:00,3190, Hit the nail on the head there Dan. In my youth I wasted a lot of coin on cars. Now my vehicles are merely transportation. Need to be reliable and functional of course. There are more important things to spend money on. And it certainly would not be spent on a piece of crap like that Dart.
713270,Harrison,2012-07-10 12:33:00,2202," Good point, plus the folks who have seen a 60s/70s Dart will be talking about it."
713294,Mike Pike,2012-07-10 13:25:00,1332,"Man, that thing is a Dart in name only.  Hate when auto manufacturers do that!  Anyone remember the rebirth of the Cougar?  YUCK!  If you do it, do it like the Challenger or Mustang.  Two sweet rides there."
713306,DanD,2012-07-10 14:05:00,2223, Thats the way Ive felt for a long time; just transportation; likely due to repairing the things for a living for so many years. But then last fall I found something that sparked my interests again. Ive been driving this old Chevy all summer and having a blast.  The picture should read Styleline Deluxe. LOL  Dan. 
713316,Musky or Specks,2012-07-10 14:27:00,2710,On a bright note Just over a month left till  http://www.moparfest.com/
713318,grimsbylander,2012-07-10 14:44:00,3016,"Remember, the target market for this vehicle has never even seen a 60s/70s Dart, much less driven one. They won't make the comparison.    True. I've got two boys just getting to the point of buying their own vehicles. Neither would have a clue, or even care to know about the old Dart. If I had my way, they'd be driving 4 cyl. carburated Chevy Suburban extended models! You'd need a calendar to clock their 1/4 mile."
713412,Snidley,2012-07-10 18:38:00,620,North American marketing leaves me astonished time after time. The car the new Dart is based on looks awesome and if it drives like a true Alfa Romeo it would drive well too. Yet the Chrysler honchos dredge up an old name and remove all of the cool styling from the originating car. I guess I just don't get it. Here's a vid of the Alfa the new Dart is based on. http://www.alfagiulietta.com/Default.aspx#/spot
713417,davey buoy,2012-07-10 18:48:00,5505, It would be so easy to just give it a different name!Everyone would be happy.
713082,misfish,2012-07-09 20:58:00,29133,"When I seen an advert for it,I was stoked. After doing some search,I was hoping for more of a bold squarer look.  My link"
713083,Terry,2012-07-09 21:06:00,14456,I see no reason for them to call it a dart..... maybe a k-car or rambler
713084,Leecher,2012-07-09 21:09:00,7832, Easy Peasy Beautiful Covergirl
713088,esoxansteel,2012-07-09 21:19:00,1307,"I was impartialed to the 1968 HEMI Darts that were available, as well as 1968 HEMI Barracuda's as well, they sported the cross-ram Hemi engine, and was sold as is, they were not street legal, and vehicle was sold without a warranty, and was for racing in timed trials, ie 1/4 miles, the cars were sold with just primer paint as they rolled out of the Hurst factory with 4-speed shifters, and you had them painted the color you wanted, the 650 plus horses was what you were after, and the car was as light as it could be with holes drilled out of the seat braces to make them even lighter, and the usual battery in the trunk, and the venerable DANA 60 rear end, and 833-A 4-speed transmission, rounded out this low 8 second factory racing legend."
713089,davey buoy,2012-07-09 21:23:00,5505,Wonder if you can get it with the 340 6 pack?.I believe with that style find a new name and let the beast be in our memories.
713090,Roy,2012-07-09 21:23:00,13728,Well it ain't the Dart of the 70's for sure. And what's with what appears to be the Chevy logo on the grill?
713094,craigdritchie,2012-07-09 21:28:00,1586,Looks like a Neon with updated sheet metal (or plastic).
713095,Gerritt,2012-07-09 21:31:00,6129,"Dart = The new Neon......   Ughhhhh no wonder I HATE MOPAR...  Wait till all the stupid kids put their Bull aluminum rear spoilers in mismatched colours, ground effects, neon underlighting.... and a sub-par muffler system on these.... add to that the stereos that sound like crap because they didnt deaden the rattling from Chryslers poor fit and finish,...... I cna see it now..... johnny 19 year old... thinks he picking up the chicks in his Dart.... in Yellow..... with a black after market spoiler he bought from Canadian Tire..... tricked out with.... wait for it.... plastic hub caps..... perhaps spinners.... add in some underbody neon... (perhaps Princess auto...) and voila.... instant Gino wanna be.....  I wish Chrysler would just die..... Ughhhhh.....  they truly are the new Neon....  way to go Chrysler..... way to go....   G"
713096,Gerritt,2012-07-09 21:32:00,6129,  Someone that understands!!!!!! we were posting at the same time
713101,misfish,2012-07-09 21:38:00,29133, My thoughts as well. My pop had a real nice Dart. It was FAST. It was his pride and joy.  I really need to get some old pics of it.
713102,davey buoy,2012-07-09 21:41:00,5505," Buddy had the black and yellow dart,I believe it had a name on it from dodge.340 6 pack.Shook the ground"
713104,Billy Bob,2012-07-09 21:48:00,5865,Not a Neon.......but it does look like a new Intrepid......this doesn't do it for me......but I did see a nice Red Dodge Charger today on the way to the dentist.......now that's a nice looking car that is very close to the real thing.
713106,bigugli,2012-07-09 21:50:00,6138,"That's not a Dart.  Maybe a souped up Yugo, but it has no right to a muscle car's legacy."
713107,Pigeontroller,2012-07-09 21:50:00,2793,"4 door, 4 cylinder front wheel drive...Thats no Dart!"
713110,kickingfrog,2012-07-09 21:57:00,8333,My father in-law wanted to puke when he saw the photos last year.          
713112,Roy,2012-07-09 22:00:00,13728,"Rob, now that is a Dart."

713124,Gerritt,2012-07-09 22:18:00,6129,   it says compact car..... not sedan..... the intrepid was far from a compact car.....  
713126,Rod Caster,2012-07-09 22:22:00,5784,"Ugh, looks worse than the new civic.  Indeed Roy, looks like a bowtie on that grille.  On the plus side, it'll only take 12 glued on, plastic air scoops to make it look decent."
713127,davey buoy,2012-07-09 22:23:00,5505,"They did a decent job with the challenger,that's a nice car somewhat along the same lines as the original."

713139,lifeisfun,2012-07-09 22:50:00,99,They should concentrate on reliability and not adding gadgets like tft cluster ...
713140,aplumma,2012-07-09 22:51:00,6896,I am thinking it will be the same as the Pontiac GTO re-release lots of hype but sales did not even get off the ground. They though the big motor would be the ticket but it was the body lines that killed it.   Art
713142,davey buoy,2012-07-09 22:55:00,5505,"Remember when they introduced the new Duster?> Raw 4 cyl power,front wheel drive,fairly small car."
713146,Raf,2012-07-09 22:59:00,3495,it's wrong wheel drive 'nuff said
