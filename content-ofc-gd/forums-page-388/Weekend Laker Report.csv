Did a little bass and pike fishing with some success but I really enjoy getting up early and chasing deepwater lake trout . I have really got into this pattern of deepwater jigging for lakers and have been quite successful at it compared to trolling around , there is no comparison in my opinion . The lakers were really active last weekend and I had alot of chasers and hits but only 3 in the boat which isn't to bad, it was a real blast having these guys shoot up off the bottom and swipe at the jig and I do mean swipe , for some reason there was alot of action but they were not smacking the jig . Here is a screen shot of a chasing laker hitting my jig .    This is a pic of the biggest one I boated    This is my fishing partner with a early morning visitor    Jig of the weekend    Back up this week to try again and have some fun"

712768,4x4bassin,2012-07-08 21:01:00,1025,"Ya , they are stockers. You can't really see it but the adipose fin (upper back) is clipped. The lakers in this lake are usually dark but this batch I got into were more silver. The moose looked like a calf and was definitely on a mission to get to the other side of the lake , literly swam 30 feet from us in the middle of the lake . It is amazing how good those guys can swim !"

712900,limeyangler,2012-07-09 12:41:00,5204,"AWESOME! In my opinion the best way to fish lakers. Its like icefishing on softwater. Watching the fish chasing your jig is a sure way to get the adrenalin flowing. We also fished this way this weekend, like you the fish were biting shy. I am gonna try that lure set up...LOOKS KILLER MAN!  Great pics and report....Love it!"
