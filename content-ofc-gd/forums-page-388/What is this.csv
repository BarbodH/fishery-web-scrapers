712470,canuckjack,2012-07-07 14:33:00,121,"Hey all, I know it's been an awfully long time since I've posted here but I had an interesting catch last week and no one I've shown it to has been able to tell me what it is.  I just know someone here has the answer.  At first I thought maybe Sheepshead but there were no teeth, my best guess is a drum which has the same slopped face and nostrils but the pictures I'm seeing online don't quite match.  Anyway, she was caught in the St. Lawrence near Long Sault in about 15 feet of water in an area with lots of current on a simple black jig with a worm.    Canuck"
712476,Woodsman,2012-07-07 14:40:00,1286,Sheepshead/freshwater drum. Different names for the same fish. Here's a small one from Nipissing. 
712480,MachZ,2012-07-07 14:56:00,2,"Yup, what he ^ said."
712481,canuckjack,2012-07-07 14:58:00,121," Did not know that, thanks Woodsman, didn't realize we had those around here."
712485,Rod Caster,2012-07-07 15:12:00,5784,Def a drum/sheep. They sure can fight.
712490,Spiel,2012-07-07 15:20:00,9065,Agreeing with everyone else.  I would have thought that area would be full of them.
712491,Roy,2012-07-07 15:25:00,13728,"Yes, lots of them there. Further East where I am, they're called ""malachigan""."
712496,mike rousseau,2012-07-07 15:45:00,4661,Yup drum/sheepshead  Lots around us.... We got this one about 30 minutes east of you a week or two ago    I actually know guys that target them in long sault...
712498,canuckjack,2012-07-07 15:55:00,121,"  Huh, shows you what I know...LOL, ah well like my sig says ""so much to learn"".  She put up a great little fight Rod Caster, lots of fun."
712546,gino,2012-07-07 19:37:00,400,bhaaaaa!!!!!!!!!
712586,oates,2012-07-07 22:30:00,151,Do people eat them?
712614,kickingfrog,2012-07-08 00:01:00,8333,Sure. I've eaten worse.
712695,spinnerdoc,2012-07-08 13:39:00,556,They said it a sheep head....I like how these fish are so silver even catching them on muddy/murky rivers
712717,Roy,2012-07-08 16:05:00,13728," Neither evil nor sick, just wrong."
712718,Twocoda,2012-07-08 16:49:00,4130, certain ethnic groups target and eat them...some groups eat them when they catch them first thing in the spring when the water is cold....others well...it doesnt matter...
712719,misfish,2012-07-08 16:52:00,29133,"  Yes,some call it, poor mans lobster."
