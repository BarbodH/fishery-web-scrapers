712756,Leecher,2012-07-08 20:29:00,7832,"Made a wonderful discovery this morning while I was having my morning coffee    for the past few weeks, every time I sat down on the bench, could hear the sound of bird wings flopping through the leaves and never could catch a glimpse of it  It got me intrigued and after a little search, found a birds nest at the top of the tree that is located at one end of my back yard deck    While looking from ground zero, could see movement through the branches and leaves.  Here's where I enjoy my first zip of coffee during the weekend    I call it ""my gateaway corner""    So I decided to have a closer look and shoot some shots with the camera but I still don't know what species it is... looked through this book I have    and figured it's a cedar waxwing but not a hundred percent sure Here's some of the shots from the camera        As you can see, the yellow tip tail and taupe coloured head and long beak had me thinking at first it was Cardinal female... no    then I thought of a blue jay... no    after consulting the book from the pic above, Waxwing was my choice but not 100% sure  Anyhoot, thought it was pretty cool to find and so close to where I get to getaway for my morning brew  If some of you have a good idea of what species it is,  by all means let it all out Tight lines TJunkie"
712760,spincast,2012-07-08 20:41:00,3279,"Cedar waxwing Jaques - tres cool. One of my faves - and ususally very shy, at least around here,"
712763,kickingfrog,2012-07-08 20:45:00,8333,I'll second spincast's statement.
712765,Twocoda,2012-07-08 20:53:00,4130,you wont find it in that book Jacques because it is written in French....try a bird book from Canada
712766,bushart,2012-07-08 20:54:00,2628,That's cool Jacques  2x this spring I seen a Baltimore Oriole (bird not ball player)  Had to look it up also to identify
712773,Leecher,2012-07-08 21:16:00,7832, Thanks for confirming Rick   poor little girl got scared when I got up close with the camera     But she came back to tend her duties   Thanks Rob!!!   LOL Dave   Sure is Terrence
712775,funfishing,2012-07-08 21:17:00,147," I have seen quite a few of them this year and the last, the bird is just called an Oriole."
712778,Leecher,2012-07-08 21:40:00,7832,   I just found a pic of the same tree I had planted in 2007     Man o man how it grew since then  
712795,Grimace,2012-07-08 23:00:00,2020,Cedar Waxwing as the others have said.  My favourite looking bird.  They travel in big groups and when they come for a visit it is quite a treat.
712807,Christopheraaron,2012-07-08 23:48:00,3525,"It's a waxwing, but I've never seen that yellow tip.    I love how smooth their feathers look..."
712854,John Bacon,2012-07-09 03:52:00,3277," Most bird books list it as a baltimore oriole; there are other types of orioles. A search on ""baltimore oriole"" yielded this result.  http://www.allaboutbirds.org/guide/baltimore_oriole/id"
712858,Skipper D,2012-07-09 04:11:00,1970,"My favorite bird as a kid was the Baltimore Oriole , the thing i remember the most was its nest hanging from high up in an elm tree that grew close to our house , it hung there like a sock , this one is not like that at all ... lol . The orioles that were around our place were mostly orange , this ones a new one on me ."
712866,funfishing,2012-07-09 06:45:00,147," Thanks for clarifying, funny I thought calling them a Baltimore Oriole was like calling a blue jay a Toronto Blue Jay."
712867,Ice Fishing Ham,2012-07-09 08:33:00,83,"They are a beautiful bird, thanks for posting TJ, you got me looking through my archives. A few years ago I noticed blossom peddles falling out of my apple tree. I discovered a few Wax Wings eating the core of the blossoms and dropping the peddles. I got a few pictures but it was difficult to get a good one.  "
712923,Out4Trout,2012-07-09 14:13:00,98,"Nice bird. Cedar waxwing, but could be a Bohemian waxwing... If you can see the wings, Cedar waxwings have red tips, Bohemians yellow."
712974,wallacio,2012-07-09 17:32:00,475, Bohemian Waxwings only breed in the extreme north and are only encountered in more southern latitudes during the winter months.
712975,BillM,2012-07-09 17:35:00,17367,It's an atlantic.
713000,Leecher,2012-07-09 18:33:00,7832," Thanks Grimace!!!   They sure look pretty   Thanks for the link JohnB!!!   Skipper!!!      Your welcome IFH!!! and thanks for posting your pic   They are indeed hard to photograph up close.   Thanks Out4Trout!!!  The only thing I can see from standing on my deck is her head and tail... If I try to get closer by stepping on the bench, she flies away   Good to know wallacio   "
