713040,BillM,2012-07-09 19:49:00,17367,"What zone is the lake in?  Check the exceptions for that zone, if the lake isn't listed, you are good to go.  You might wanna check this PDF below...  Found it via Google.  http://www.richmondhill.ca/documents/heritage_lake_wilcox.pdf"
713042,Christopheraaron,2012-07-09 19:55:00,3525,"I already did, I'm thinking that it may be a town rule, but it's been brought up before and I am wondering where this came from..."

713185,redpearl99,2012-07-10 00:37:00,259,"on a related note, I went for a swim last week in lake wilcox and the water was just terrible.  The bottom was this thick goopy quicksand material and there were almost no weeds.  I remember just a few yrs ago how there was healthy weed growth in that lake.  I honestly don't think many fish can survive in the lake anymore.  I saw a couple trolling the lake for hours without catching anything"
713186,Christopheraaron,2012-07-10 00:39:00,3525,"Good to know pearl, the question I was emailing was actually about trapping leeches in the marsh part of the lake, I've completely given up on that lake for some time now..."
