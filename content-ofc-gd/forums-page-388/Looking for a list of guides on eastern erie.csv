I am looking into a day trip for big smallies with my girlfriend, I dont want to spend much more than 350 though but either way I will explore all options.  I usually fish in long point bay but have found the fish to be getting smaller every year, just want to get her out and tie her into some big dawgs and need someone familiar with the waters.  Thanks for any help in advance fellas!"
