1021693,buckhorn250,2018-01-24 11:12:00,85,Hey guys I had a perch weekend on Simcoe booked with the boys this Saturday...first time for all of us. After the recent thaw and a warmer Saturday how safe will it be out there? Im booked with Mitchells in Beaverton. Thanks 
1021700,porkpie,2018-01-24 12:20:00,2521,"You'll be fine and an operator will know where the cracks are.  It's also unlikely to run into much in the way of pressure cracks on the way to the Beaverton perch grounds.  There is generally a beauty on the way out for whitefish and lakers though.  If I makes you feel any better about it, I'll be out of port bolster with one of my kids on the weekend and I wouldn't take him if I thought I'd run into trouble. I've been out of bolster a couple of times this year, and been out way past the operators huts and there are no cracks (at least there weren't last week) and the ice is 18 inches thick most areas I've drilled.  I don't anticipate much difference on the Beaverton perch grounds, and I usually go out there."
1021702,AKRISONER,2018-01-24 13:03:00,5558,there was over a foot of solid black ice 2 weeks ago...takes a lot more than what we just had to thaw that much ice...plus its friggin cold this morning...enough to put enough ice that you can walk on anywhere that cracked up...no issue what so ever.
1021716,BillM,2018-01-24 15:09:00,17367,I wouldn't worry about ice thickness I'd be worrying about traction..   Make sure you've got cleets or ice skates
1021722,buckhorn250,2018-01-24 16:59:00,85,thanks guys...appreciate the insight....looking forward to it. 
1021742,misfish,2018-01-24 20:48:00,29133,"Your booked with an operator. If it was not safe, he wont be taking you out.  Even after all that rain, we had a super flash freeze here. The weekend is looking nice for walkers and dragers.  Sorry sled heads. LOL"
1021744,huzzsaba,2018-01-24 21:15:00,884,going out with gilford yellow huts tomorrow. Said ice is good.  Wish us luck!
1021745,Terry,2018-01-24 21:24:00,14456,looks good for studs and chains too
1021748,misfish,2018-01-24 22:00:00,29133,"Yup, if your going long distance. LOL  "
1021755,sleepjigging,2018-01-24 23:36:00,207,"Just got off the ice at Gilford. Truck was on it earlier this week. I found >15"" black ice. Slick on top as the melt of last couple of days had refrozen last night. Under the ice (sight fishing 12 FOW) I saw perch - they were biting today, except the jumbo one, bass, CARP - gigantic ones roaming around, pike - he took a big gulp of my lure and spat it. Sunfish - big spots on the sides. (Maybe some walters)  "
1021803,Sinker,2018-01-25 18:38:00,8692,"The ice will be safer than it has been for several years. One mild day only helps make ice.  Water freezes faster than it thaws, so what thaws in a day, is mostly snow, then that refreezes and makes even more ice. A january thaw is always a good thing for the ice.  S."
