1021921,captpierre,2018-01-27 15:30:00,2521,"So, just to clarify. Hookworms are small worms that used to be common in people in the old days. Dogs and other mammals have them too. But hookworms are species specific in that adult worms only live in the intestines of their designated hosts. But baby hookworms(larvae) from say dogs , can still penetrate human skin and cause local problems. But can’t get to the gut to live and lay eggs to perpetuate their life cycle. Us vets recommend dogs to be on regular parasite control that includes hookworms.  Lots of stray dogs in the third world that have no parasite control.  Crapping all over the place. Including beaches it seems ?"
