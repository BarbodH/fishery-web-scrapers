1021910,captpierre,2018-01-27 03:25:00,2521,Went up to Buckhorn area to check the cottage today. Beautiful weather but was surprised at how little snow there was. Just a dusting out in the open. Few inches in the woods.  Gannon Narrows wide open as is the water above and below Buckhorn Falls for quite a ways.  Crazy winter.
1021913,Tjames09,2018-01-27 11:42:00,664,Ya we lost all the snow when it was 10* for about 3 days straight and rained. Didn’t recover from that.
1021915,fisherman7,2018-01-27 12:19:00,325,"Yup, the channel infront of my house on Upper Buckhorn is wide open. Hardly any snow at all."
1021934,GBW,2018-01-27 19:08:00,8460,Well with it being +7* out right now even the snow piles in Lindsay are almost gone.
1021948,BillM,2018-01-27 20:08:00,17367,Melting quick here in Barrie as well.
1021949,misfish,2018-01-27 20:14:00,29133,"Yes it is Bill. Was out this morning , and the ice is soft. The first 4"" of the 12 we have. Water is pooled up and holes look like toilets flushing. Ice is still good to walk on though. No worries there. The problem is the water visibility. Getting cloudy. Marking on the finder was a be atch this morning, and worse as the morning went on."
