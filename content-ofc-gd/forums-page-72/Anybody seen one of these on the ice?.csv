1021119,limeyangler,2018-01-12 02:03:00,5204," This might work, not sure on the price though.       "
1021120,irishfield,2018-01-12 04:38:00,26272,FINE.. for no rigid tow bar!!
1021124,ch312,2018-01-12 13:41:00,1590,There's the Snow Dog which can pull over 1000 lbs and costs around $3k US that you could likely copy and build for $1000 or so. A used snowmobile for $1000-1500 is likely the easiest and cheapest option. Might even find an old sled for a couple hundred bucks that you could restore for a few bucks or use it's parts to make something like the Snow Dog. If you're going to try and build something that will only work on ice with little to no snow cover you might as well just use a Smitty sled.
1021127,Fisherman,2018-01-12 15:23:00,7201,"Here's the newer version, no price yet."
1021137,Old Ironmaker,2018-01-12 17:05:00,8243,"If my body continues to break down like it is I will use my elec. mobility chair and throw some chains on the tires. If I were to look for something just for ice fishing, not trail riding etc. it would be a good used snow machine or ATV with chains you can use all year.  Like it has been said here no need to re invent the wheel."
1021619,aplumma,2018-01-23 00:44:00,6896,Here is another direction to consider.  Art
1021632,John Bacon,2018-01-23 06:16:00,3277,I looks like it could cut holes in the ice for you too.
1021664,aplumma,2018-01-23 21:18:00,6896,You would have to be careful doing donuts.lol  Art
1021902,maker a laker,2018-01-26 20:58:00,33,"Hello, Where did you get the dog harnesses for the sled? I have an 80lb Lab that could use the exercise when we go out on the ice. "
1022056,TJQ,2018-01-29 23:34:00,7806,LOL.. that thing looks cool... i dunno how well it would work.  I need one for cordwood.
1022057,misfish,2018-01-29 23:50:00,29133,"Nope, it,s a mini yimmydude."
1021015,Shloim,2018-01-10 18:41:00,515,"So, although I'm new to the ice fishing game, I realize that albeit great exercise, walking isn't always fun. The options available aren't great either, nor are they inexpensive. So I did some googling after seeing the snow dog sled in action. So although they may not be super fast this can carry your stuff out pretty good Id say... Thoughts???? "
1021016,John Bacon,2018-01-10 18:48:00,3277,It doesn't look like something that would handle deep snow very well.
1021018,Shloim,2018-01-10 18:59:00,515,Good point....  but there are track driven versions that might work. Or that might be why 
1021036,Old Ironmaker,2018-01-10 21:24:00,8243,"The first thing I saw. OK if you are travelling on flat ice Shloim, come to a drift or a mogul higher than the clearance and you are going to stop and drill a hole right there.  I wouldn't invest in one. I don't know the cost but subtract that from a snow machine or an ATV. The strangest ice fishing transportation I have ever seen and bet I will ever see was a guy with a horse on The Ottawa River. I don't know if he rode on it over the ice or just led it. I didn't talk to him. I didn't think standing next to 1/2 ton of beast on 8"" of ice was a great idea."
1021046,Joeytier,2018-01-11 00:19:00,3990,Is that a snowblower with one of those gardening store trolley's welded onto it? 
1021047,Fisherman,2018-01-11 00:49:00,7201,"Those snow dog traction engines cost well over $4000, saw one at the Barrie Ice fishing show a couple weeks ago. You can get one of these for about the same price, maybe less. https://www.irbisusa.com/irbis-t150/"
1021050,Old Ironmaker,2018-01-11 02:45:00,8243,Were in Heavens name is $4000.00 worth of engine. That would be a very expensive lawnmower or snow blower.  4 grand!!!!!???? You get a good used snow machine or ATV for 4 grand just to use for icefishing.
1021058,Shloim,2018-01-11 12:23:00,515,
1021059,Shloim,2018-01-11 12:27:00,515,"Ok the point I was trying to make is I can't believe I'm the first guy to try or actually make a powered sled. Even if it only goes as fast as a brisk walk, but carries you and a sled full of gear it would be awesome IMO. The other factor was weight and space that it takes up the other 350 days a year.... I'm looking for a snowblower with tracks now btw. If anyone has one kicking around.... "
1021060,Fish Farmer,2018-01-11 12:43:00,2234,"Saw a guy once a few years ago using a rototiller out from Old Cut, bit noisy, but worked. Buddy and myself laughed. Need someone to invent something that pulls that doesn't need licence and insurance. Riding lawn mower ???? Anything is possible. Tackle shops would be sold out!!!"
1021061,Fisherman,2018-01-11 13:03:00,7201,"You're right, not the first, second or last.  Why try and re invent the wheel or track.  Honda and Yamaha have tracked blowers.."
1021062,Shloim,2018-01-11 13:05:00,515,"They have things tha5 fit the bill. No ins or registration but they are $4500.00. My idea was repurposing something that is otherwise scrap, that can be easily transported and fits in a normal vehicle... once we add in a trailer and all the other stuff it's easier to just walk.. ."
1021064,Shloim,2018-01-11 13:10:00,515,Exactly there's a video on tbe net of a guy with a stand on conversion that looks incredible... works great in the video! Im gonna do this! From what i understand the transmitions and drive systems outlast the auger blower parts that are more succeptanle to rust etc.
1021071,ketchenany,2018-01-11 14:13:00,3229,The season will be over by the time you get out to the trout grounds  Not exactly Maserati!
1021072,Fisherman,2018-01-11 14:21:00,7201,And once the front wheels start digging into the snow or slush it will be like a shopping cart with wobbly wheels all over the place except where you want to go.   I'd be putting a set of quick strap on skis there in place when you're on the lake.  Hope you make it back by the end of the season.   Maybe swap out the skinny tires for a wider set of ATV tires.
1021073,Shloim,2018-01-11 14:57:00,515,"Ok ok you guys are a total buzz kill.... I'm not investing heavily in this, but it's gonna stay in the back of my mind as I begin to assemble parts"

How do two guys lift this at the end of the day. I put a short  4x4 in each corner with 1/2 inch hole in it. Got an old car jack and had a piece of rebar welded to the  jack, insert in hole and jack it up.  One person could do it.  "
1021083,jimmer,2018-01-11 16:52:00,2730,"With ice like that, I would be walking.  The trouble starts when the snow is deep, so I would like to see how that operates in a foot of snow."
