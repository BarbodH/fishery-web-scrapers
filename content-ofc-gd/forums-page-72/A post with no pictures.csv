With,n reason.  Then the pm reads , 2 newfies coming up.  LOL  So back and forth go the pms. Everything is set up.  Im always out before the fish bite and set up to claim our area. Get the text they are here. Great. I said look for the furthest clam out. They see me and say, see ya soon. Well soon took a bit of time. I keep an eye out the hut winda waiting to see them. Hmmmm, no one close yet. I could hear newfie chattering going on in a distance. Dats got to be dem. Look out the winda and see 2 byes making their way. Slip sliding away. I could tell deez byes were da ones. I cautiously step out of my hut to greet them.  ( we will get back to the cautiously thing.) We greet each other and show them a place to set up. I retreat back to my hut and start back to fishing. A few minutes go by and I can here some choice words. Look out da winda   and well,, ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,I head out cautiously again, to lend da brudders a hand.  Drill them some holes, and help get their pop ""OUT"" hut set.  I have never had a  good laugh as I did this morning. I even said, byes, I wont film this. Wish I had now. We finally got it anchored down and set while I kept one eye on my hut the whole time.  Once they were set, I retreated back to my hut. Was not the best of day for fishing, as the water was cloudy. Small ponds on the hard water. Holes were acting like flushing toilets. As always though, a day fishing is better then not. Was great to finally meet ya Tender 52 ( Colin ) and yer friend  Ryan. Hope the long view of OWL eyes, did not torment him to much.  Hope you enjoyed your time on the hard water here.    B  So back to  ( we will get back to the cautiously thing.) The south west wind was crazy. There were times I thought my tent was going to rip off the frame.  I was worried about getting off my ars and stepping out, and my hut was going to end up in Beaverton.  I threw out the anchor hoping if it did go for a fly, I would be able to run it down. 30-50 km gusts.

I am not new to the ice fishing scene, but that morning made me look like a new born. Allow me to extend on our adventure. Friday evening..... Ryan... I will be up for 4, Be to your place 4:45(ish) Me .. yep. Me 5 am Saturday ... you lost? R.. nope just on my way out the door. Me... No problem the lake isnt going anywhere Me 5:30... ok your lost arent you R.. nope i just pulled in I look out the window, and no Ryan.  I Text again. Nope your not here. (R)... yep your car is right in front of me!  Now I come to conclusion of hes at my buddies house 10 doors down who has the same style and make of mine. I walk down knock on the window and say follow me. (Insert laugh track ) All is good. Fresh coffees and away we go. Upon arrival  The ticket thing for parking says the credit card is no good??? Ok??? no big I hit the bait shop for minnows and change to feed the machine. (as Misfish previously stated) out we go. and dump goes the minnow bucket. Only half of it so it was a easy recovery. However we didd'nt count on the 10 min of walking sideways and slip sliding away. With Misfish's help we are set up, The laughs and stories went on. Late morning Misfish was calling it a day and stopped by to check in on the bye's. 10 minutes of friendly banter and making Ryan's OWL eyes even bigger, off he goes. Skip to 2:30 and wind has picked up some more. The tent looks like lungs filling then releasing so enough of this I say. Everything gets packed into the sleds except for the hut till last.... Then the $#!+ show started.  4 times we tried to get the hut down while all the time another side blew back out. Once Me and my 210lb frame had to pin it to the ice.  ( Shout out to the Fat Max 3. It took a pounding of 40+ gusts all day and not even a loose stitch at the end of the day. Even though it looked like a football at times.) And we made some new cuss words that had us both in tears. ( those will be held for pm's only ) Finally back to shore and dump goes the Minnows again. This time....breasts up. Shiners everywhere. Quickly clean them up and to the hotel we go. We clean up pretty good and off to OWL land we go. We mucked into wings and burgers like it was our last meal. ( Diddnt see any Russians B ) But Ryan was a good boy Look me up If your down this way B. Cheers all. "

""I am goin' huntin' tomorrow Buddy and don't want to close the clinic. I want you to take care of the clinic and take care of all my patients and I'll give you fifty bucks.""  ""Yes, sir!"" answers Buddy   The doctor goes hunting and returns the following day and asks: ""So, Buddy, How was your day?""  Buddy told him that he took care of three patients. ""The first one had a Headache so I gave him TYLENOL.""  ""Bravo Buddy! The second one?"" asks the doctor.  ""The second one had a bad stomach and I gave him MAALOX, sir."" says Buddy  ""Bravo, bravo! You're good at this and what about the third one?"" asks the Doctor  ""Well Sir, I was sitting here having a smoke and suddenly the door flies opens and a woman enters. Like a flame, she undresses herself, taking off everything including her bra and her panties and lies down on the table and shouts: HELP ME - I haven't seen a man in over two years  ""Lard Tunderin' Yeezus, Buddy!!! What did you do?""  I put drops in her eyes!! "
