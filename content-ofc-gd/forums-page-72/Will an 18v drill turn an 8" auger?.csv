1021307,misfish,2018-01-17 19:36:00,29133,Yes. I tried them awhile back. Bought a unit at the hock shop. It was CRAP. Took it back.
1021312,misfish,2018-01-18 00:39:00,29133,This weekend is looking like a good walk about and drill lots of holes. My weekend starts Friday morning. Let the good times drill.
1021436,aws,2018-01-20 15:33:00,53,"So Stupid me.  I was using a 20 v cordless dewalt drill trying to cut a 6"" hole in 24 ga steel.  The hole saw caught, my hand twisted and i snapped a tiny tendon in my left thumb.  Diagnosis - arthritic thumb.  Pain every time i use it.  Sugery might help no guarantees. So buy the plate attachment.  Dont use a small drill on a big hole. "
1020548,porkpie,2017-12-31 16:56:00,2521,"Smaller holes.  I've pulled quite a few whities and some decent lakers through a 6 inch hole no problem.  Either that or you can invest in a Milwaukee fuel and 5ah batteries and it'll probably cost you around the price of a nice gas auger.  If it where me I'd probably just stick with a six inch drill bit, but I'm frugal so there you go."
1020561,misfish,2017-12-31 17:45:00,29133,"I could still hear Terry this morning saying WOW, while he drilled his holes. LOL"
1020978,JoshS,2018-01-09 22:44:00,729,"Does anyone know if the Milwaukee M18 Fuel 2603-20 will do the job with an 8"" auger? Think it has 725 lbs of torque and is the older gen model. I tried my bosch drill with the clam conversion kit for fun and it doesn't even come close at 450lbs of torque. "
1020983,misfish,2018-01-09 23:36:00,29133,"That model does not have the kick out feature. You will not be happy with it. A 6 will be no problem. I started with the 1st gen. Moved up to the gen 2. Much better for the 8""."
1020985,Shloim,2018-01-09 23:58:00,515,"I kept my drill and downsized to a 6"" auger. Works like a charm!"
1021006,JoshS,2018-01-10 16:33:00,729,"Ok thanks for the advice. I found a used one, glad I asked first before I got it! It seems like only the milwaukee second gen fuel at 1200lbs works? Too bad it's almost the same price as an electric auger when all is said and done with the clam kit. Do you know any other drills that work?Although hand drilling is a good workout, it's getting tiring and the ice is just getting thicker lol."
1021007,misfish,2018-01-10 16:50:00,29133,"I cant speak for other drills, but I did notice that Paul (Tybo ) was running a large Dewalt last weekend. 20volt if Im not mistaken.  When I get my 6"" finbor 3, I,ll be using that. Just drill 2 holes side by side, if Im going after lakers, which I hardly do. Im a whitie guy.."
1021009,JoshS,2018-01-10 17:07:00,729,"I got an 8"" finbor but think I'm turning into a whitie guy myself... they are too tasty. Tybo says he burnt the Dewalt in his previous post? Anyone got any experience with other drills that work with an 8""?"
1021010,misfish,2018-01-10 17:25:00,29133,He has a new power house drill.  
1021011,farsider,2018-01-10 17:35:00,456,"Remember, that the ft/lbs that is quoted by the manufacturer is relatively meaningless.  There is no standard on how this metric is achieved.  They are just marketing figures.  One maker can realize those numbers under zero load in a lab.  Or another accomplishes it another way.  However they want to position a particular model within their other models or compared to other makers.  I have used an early Makita with a 3ah on my FB3 (8).  But I baby it.  (clear out the shavings often as I go and keeping batteries warm when not in use)  But, I also don't drill a ton of holes in a day.  Have heard many good things about the Milwaukee. Milwaukee now has a 9ah battery and Makita has a 6ah.  The beauty of investing in a good drill is it is a useful tool the rest of the year.  Compared with a gas auger which as AB might say, is a unitasker and mostly takes up space.  And, I always bring the manual handle along just in case something goes kaput so I can continue fishing if something conks out.  Cheers, Mark"
1021048,Tybo,2018-01-11 02:14:00,1373,I have the new dewalt like brian said. It is twice the power of the drill I burnt. The new one says 820 uwo{unit watts out} which in turn is a better system to measure torque. Inch pound torque is measured at the highest stall rating and uwo is a  measurement at spin torque. What the difference is I don't know. I do know that the new drill with adaptor will cut threw 12 inches of ice on a fb3  very well and with a swedebore 6 like butter.
1021115,pics,2018-01-11 21:41:00,1268,I finally got to try my clam plate with the sail auger and Milwaukee drill.. Amazing combination.. About 15 holes drilled in 9 inches of ice with the battery still reading full.. Cuts like butter...
1021123,ch312,2018-01-12 13:17:00,1590," I can't wrap my head around the idea of so many people wasting so much time and money trying to find the best drill for ice fishing. Just go buy a cheap Ridgid hammer drill for $200 with a lifetime warranty for when, not if, you burn out the drill. You might even be able to get a two drill combo for around the same price. Save the good drills for renovations or work where it's not being over worked and/or soaked with water and snow. My drill is about 3 years old and I don't even use the second battery most days."
1021125,SirCranksalot,2018-01-12 14:09:00,3291,Did you buy the Finbore knockoff that was on sale a few weeks back?
1021126,Terry,2018-01-12 14:24:00,14456,I thought the lifetime warranty was just on the batteries
1021178,pics,2018-01-13 01:36:00,1268,Yes.. I paid $69 for it
1021183,fundseeker,2018-01-13 14:25:00,27,"Anyone looking for a 1200 in Lb torque drill for powering a manual ice auger should check out Home Depot in "" Newmarket"". They have a Milwaukee Fuel hammer drill / impact driver combo regular $500 for $349.00 which includes the model 2704-20 drill and the 2753-20 impact driver with a 5 Amp hr and a 2 Amp Hr battery and charger in a case. The sales guy there said it was a special combo brought in normally sold in the U.S. I don't know if this combo is available at other Depot's , they seemed to have a very large Milwaukee inventory with promo canopy set up at this store. They said there is usually a Milwaukee rep in the store but he wasn't there Thursday. I grabbed one to power my 8"" Fin Bore 3 auger with a Clam conversion Plate I picked up at Sail . Just thought some of you might be considering this and might want to save some $ . Good luck!"
1021197,Old Ironmaker,2018-01-14 02:04:00,8243,"Batteries do not like the cold, we all know that. From experience when we did construction in winter and to extend battery life was not to leave a battery in any battery operated tool when not in use. When we were building in the dead of winter the construction guys kept their spare batteries in a insulated cooler bag and when really cold they would use one of those hand warmers kept on with an elastic band or elec tape when stored. I had a good idea that actually worked. Actually on the Ryobi battery operated tools the instruction are to never leave the battery in the tool when not in use. It would suck to go out for the day and batteries die fast. Hope this helps."
1021213,misfish,2018-01-14 18:21:00,29133,"My 5 ah was outside this morning from 6am til 11 am -19. I only drilled 4 holes at my one spot. For the hell of it, I checked the battery. Still full 4 bars. New battery's have come alonggggggg way."
1021229,porkpie,2018-01-15 12:31:00,2521,"Yep, the new batteries don't seem affected at all.  I bough the 5ah to power my circular saw and hackzall, and I've used it on the drill fishing last year and this.  I drilled more than a dozen holes to find fish the other day, then left it outside the hut for 5 hours and the battery gauge hadn't depleted a bit. I was pretty impressed."
1021283,pics,2018-01-16 23:43:00,1268,I only use a 6 inch drill.. Doesn't say much about the size of the fish I catch but you may be surprised at what could fit through.. 20180116_121934_001.mp4
1021293,Tjames09,2018-01-17 03:16:00,664,just got this setup recently....bought a Bosch 18v drill. it only managed 4 holes before the battery died.....not sure what to think. Not much good if I can only cut 4 holes.
1021295,Shloim,2018-01-17 10:10:00,515,"That's Bosch! My business is very drill oriented we have several of every type. I have a 5 year old dewalt 18v with a 20v battery adapter and 5ah battery and I've drilled a dozen 6"" holes since charging last with not even a sign of fatigue... maybe it was just a bad battery???? "
1021296,Shloim,2018-01-17 10:15:00,515,Like a charm! I switched from a straight blade auger to a curved fin bore 3 style blade and people can't believe how it rips! Now I hope we only have huge fish pics to post!!!!

I have an offset handle swede bore that I love but with the plate I wanted something with the curved blades to make it easier on the drill.. I had a good look at the Sail drill that was out of the box and on display... the blades are identical to the fin bore... We just need ice now...
1019940,Shloim,2017-12-19 13:51:00,515,Oh I'll need a lot more than just ice... I couldn't even buy an auger right! The learning curve just got steeper
1019946,misfish,2017-12-19 16:19:00,29133,"Get the 6"". You can drill side by side if you want. Please just make sure you mark the hole when you leave so no one steps in it. A simple branch will do. Or if it,s a good catching hole, put a large flag on it. I,ll find it the next day. LOL  Seriously though, go get the 6"" curved blade auger. You will not regret it. I hope. LOL And don't forget, let the auger do the cutting with that one."
1019969,porkpie,2017-12-19 22:42:00,2521,"I've used a cheap 6"" auger just like the one you have bought on a drill for the last 2 seasons now. I am using a standard Milwaukee compact drill with 550 inch pounds of torque on a clam auger plate.  A couple of observations.  1) you don't nessecarilly need a 1200 inch pounds drill unless you want to turn an 8 inch.  2) you can get by with the CT adapter but the clam is much better.  I have owned both the auger plate from clam and used it last season, the year before that I used the Canadian tire adapter and made an auger stop for it. It worked well enough but the clam is so much easier.  3). The drill you are showing in your picture won't get you the same number of holes that others may be reporting, although it will cut, but I think will be best suited to a 6 inch bit.  4).  The cheap auger you've purchased will cut just fine, and I own a nils master that I could've got an adapter for.  I'm still using the cheap auger to great effect.  I can get 50 holes through nearly a foot of ice on a 5ah battery.  And yes we did do this for fun one day."
1019971,misfish,2017-12-19 23:39:00,29133,"Good points Porkpie. I miss somethings as it,s a question that has been being asked a lot the past few years. II went with the fuel gen 2, as I wanted to use a 8"" FB3 to cut my holes. Like you say, it has  great torq  1,200 in-lbs  The Dewalt with the XRP battery did ok, but I only got 20 holes or so. When I went to the fuel gen 2 with the 5ah, I got 40+ holes through 10"" of black ice.  We as well, did this to see how many holes I could get out of one battery. This was with a 8"" FB3 If he goes with the XRP Dewalt battery, he will be fine IMO. I started with the normal ones. Then went with the XRP.  I was using the 6"" fb3 though. I havent tried a normal flat blade auger, so saying the FB3 is the best might be an understatement   on my behalf, but it,s all I have ever used. The Fuel gen 2 is brushless and has a  1,200 in-lbs like I said. Also has a over load knock out feature. I also like the ratchet down chuck. Once it,s tighten down, you turn it back one click to lock it. Will not unleash. When I started out with the Dewalt with the XRP and 6"" FB3, I was happy. Saved the rotator cuff from swelling up. I even took it up to Nip and showed some of the byes how well it worked. They were impressed that I was able to drill 15 holes through 30"" of ice with it. I actually had 7  done before they got their gasers started up. No lie.  Can we get some ice please, then we can talk fish talk. LOL "
1019973,Shloim,2017-12-19 23:56:00,515,"Funny, this came up. First off, if I can get 20 holes from a dewalt xrp I'm good. I have at least 8 18v and 5 20v batteries, (I'm an electrical contractor) not only that, Home Depot had the huge 20v battery on sale for a ridiculous price of $200. So I checked on amazon and it eas for sale for $89.... well they priced matched it. So not only am I good company, but I'm handy and build and wire houses.... So basically what I'm trying to say is ""PICK ME! PICK ME!!!  when looking for fishing company."

1019979,porkpie,2017-12-20 01:11:00,2521,"Your good then.  You'll really only need a couple of batteries out there, just an extra for backup.  The only time I cut that many holes was when we wanted to see just how much it could do.  To be honest I was pretty surprised.  I've never been a 50 holes per day guy. Brian, the Milwaukee fuel is definitely the way to go for the guy looking to get into it, might as well go big if your buying a drill for the auger.  I only mentioned it because a lot of guys have homeowner drills that will work just fine if they are of decent quality."

It will turn my old 6"" F.B. for many holes in 2-3-ft of ice no problem but barely turns the 8"" F.B. I just bought  . The anti overtorque shut off built  into the batteries shuts it down every 5 sec or so. The gear reduction box would be a lot cheaper than the M18 Milwaukee ."

1019886,ch312,2017-12-18 15:32:00,1590,"To make your blades last much longer just hit each blade with one or two strokes with a sharpener/stone (I use a Speedy Sharp) after every outing to keep a nice edge. Hundreds of holes later and my Fin Bore 3 cuts as new.  You often hear of people ruining auger blades by trying to sharpen them and that's because most people wait until their auger is dull before trying to sharpen. If you let it get dull enough to notice a difference in cutting, you'll have to try and remove too much material at once to get the edge back which greatly increases the odds of screwing up the angle on the cutting edge. This is why most auger sharpening fails. One or two strokes is not enough to change anything, but it's enough to keep a sharp edge.    I haven't compared old vs new Clam plates. Are the newer ones improved enough to justify selling old to buy new?"
1019887,ch312,2017-12-18 15:40:00,1590," The one in the link @ Sail is the same color as the Fin Bore Micro, which I thought they discontinued a few years back.
