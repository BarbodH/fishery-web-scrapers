1021839,aws,2018-01-26 01:29:00,53,yes very cool.  They sure are slow this time of year
1021845,chris.brock,2018-01-26 02:31:00,4053,Cool footage. They seem to stack up and overwinter in the same spots every year. I'd avoid that spot because they don't release well from deep water in the winter and of course they are oos.
1021854,grimsbylander,2018-01-26 03:50:00,3016,Bang on. It's neat to see those fish at this time of year. I know they're tight to the bottom from late fall on and into December but it's interesting to see them belly to the bottom in the video.
1021859,Tjames09,2018-01-26 12:07:00,664,Ya I moved. I was looking for lake trout. They were in 50 feet. There was a lot there though. Most hardly moved.
1021865,KawarthaAngler,2018-01-26 14:09:00,273,That's cool.  I'm in the Kawartha's as well.  What lake was that?  Also ... what type of underwater cam is that? Thanks!
1021877,blaque,2018-01-26 16:34:00,2419,That fish just laying on the bottom cracked me up lol.........what a couch potato
1021906,Tjames09,2018-01-26 22:55:00,664,"Its a Marcum, not sure the model. Its a lake north of the Kawarthas."
1022040,KawarthaAngler,2018-01-29 18:43:00,273,Just looked it up on Amazon.  Man ... those things ain't cheap!  Thanks
1022053,TJQ,2018-01-29 23:01:00,7806,I love underwater vids.. man those fish are just chillin.
1022092,OhioFisherman,2018-01-30 17:00:00,6623,"LOL, I watched a video of a couple of guys fishing for spotted bass in the winter in a northern California lake, open water and they are fishing like 65 feet deep and brought in one with mud on it's bottom."
