I wish I could show the pictures of their smiling faces, but confidentiality policies don't allow. Anyway, I promised to cook the fish for them eat the drop in centre the next day for lunch, they were smiling even more, nice to have a job where you feel like you make a difference to the people you provide service to. Anyway, enough rambling, this is what I came up with.....  Cracked Black pepper and rock salt sautéed Walleye and Bacon sandwich on Pumpernickel, with a sweet chilli and horseradish mayo served with fresh cut, homemade onion rings and salad garnish. OH YEAH!    "

Thanks Spiel, I'm having a little reunion with my kitchen recently, have not done much cooking in a while, kinda enjoying it, think because I have time to do it. Thanks dude, was well received for sure, my son wants to do another video recipe with me for it tomorrow night."
