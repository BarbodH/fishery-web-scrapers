Just wondering if anyone here can make the decision on an outfitter a little easier. Any suggestions on a place up and around the Nippising waters? Also, maybe a few tips on making the wknd memorable and/or comfortable for the group. "

1021855,Chuck Enwinde,2018-01-26 06:53:00,247,.  Reeds Outdoor Adventures are  always on fish.  Bear Creek has a very solid reputation.  Ice Bungalows if you want a TV for the Leafs game.  Rob Hyatt is another good one.  Lots of choices but you may need to call a few to get a weekend rental this late in the game.
1021856,Woodsman,2018-01-26 10:14:00,1286,A weekend trip this year may leave you very few options. Most will already be booked. If they have lots of openings there may be a reason. That said even good operators have cancelations. Start calling soon and don't wait too long to book if you find an opening. Could also asked to be put on a list for cancelations.
1021860,Dutch01,2018-01-26 12:58:00,1431,Last night on Facebok IceBungalows.com (Dennis Johnson) posted that he had one super bungalow left this season. Better call quick! Anglers Haven another great operator but not sure if they have any vacancy.
1021861,Acountdeleted,2018-01-26 13:56:00,2562,"Reeds has treated us well these past 2 years. We are doing an overnight 2 weeks Friday with them. Nicest people I have ever met, put us on fish and the rates are reasonable. Can do the entire weekend or for a large enough group (4 plus) can do a 1 night overnight. Highly recommend."
1021867,Smokercrafty,2018-01-26 15:17:00,227,"Fantastic info guys. I'll be doing some calling. I never really thought of how quick the bookings could get eaten up. If not this year, definitely next. Thanks to all that replied. "
