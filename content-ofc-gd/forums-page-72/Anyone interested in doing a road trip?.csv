1022152,Big Cliff,2018-02-01 13:14:00,6899,"I'm tired of winter and thinking a road trip to Myrtle Beach for some pier fishing (Apache Pier) might be a nice way to spend a bit of time. Daytime temperatures are running between 10 and 17° C so it would be a lot better than here. I was thinking of leaving Lindsay around Monday the 5th and being back home around the 12th (I'm flexible). I'll provide transportation (2018 Corolla) and pay for fuel, you pay for your own food and out of pocket expenses we can share accommodations. (A nice clean room with hot breakfast off the beach is typically about $50.00/ night + tax. If you are interested let me know."
1022162,crappieperchhunter,2018-02-01 15:56:00,2582,Can't swing it this winter Cliff....but next winter when I'm retired and the boss is still working....I'd be all over this offer. Somebody take this man up on his offer. You WILL have a great road trip. Safe travels and good luck fishing Cliff.  
1022163,ketchenany,2018-02-01 18:52:00,3229,I'm in the same boat as Crappie Cliff. I'm off Fridays if later this month you want to try Hales?
1022165,bigugli,2018-02-01 19:01:00,6138,"What an offer!  I should be all over this, but I'm taking the grandkids on a trip the week after."
1022166,grt1,2018-02-01 20:18:00,638,"jeeze , i wish i lived closer, i'd be in to take the trip (might have to fib to the wife about my whereabouts though)"
1022169,Loonietoon,2018-02-02 03:03:00,1450,"Cliff, how in the world do you get in a Toyota Corrolla"
1022178,Mister G,2018-02-02 21:33:00,1429,I was onboard that train until I realized I have therapy I can't miss........
1022187,Big Cliff,2018-02-03 12:10:00,6899,This trip is therapy
1022188,Rizzo,2018-02-03 14:13:00,4754,I can't make it but I would be happy to send my mother-in-law with you
1022189,Loonietoon,2018-02-03 14:49:00,1450,I do not know why part of this post is missing.??? I posted that with Cliff inside how would a person like me get in there also. and Bruces reply is also missing
1022190,Loonietoon,2018-02-03 14:51:00,1450,I also can not get in from my favorites tells me  message 404 ???? have to go and enter it from google
1022192,aplumma,2018-02-03 15:14:00,6896,we had a repair done on the site and we had to back it up a few hours.  Art
1022193,OhioFisherman,2018-02-03 15:19:00,6623,LOL! My last mother in law's name was Myrtle and all she did was Beach!
1022199,Loonietoon,2018-02-03 16:38:00,1450, Hope it fixes the problem Art so l can get back in on my favorites
1022211,Mister G,2018-02-03 20:07:00,1429,"Uncle Cliff you are RIGHT, but just a few weeks ago I had total shoulder replacement and the bride would change the locks if I missed my physical therapy. I hope this kicks this back to the top so you get someone for that needed trip in the south. BTW have you thought of a trip to Vegas instead. Many people go there stag and it's much cheaper then you would think."
1022214,Big Cliff,2018-02-03 20:15:00,6899,"Totally understand my friend, standing on a pier reeling in fish for a couple of days would probably be more than that shoulder could take anyway! I am actually thinking of doing a road trip to Arizona in a couple of weeks, I've always wanted to see the Grand Canyon and take one of the mule tours right down into the canyon, that sort of thing. I may be delaying the Myrtle Beach trip for a few days, they are calling for a storm coming in tonight and into tomorrow. since it looks like I'm going solo this trip it really doesn't matter when I leave anyway."
1022248,16 Footer,2018-02-04 11:48:00,191,"Lots to see in Arizona The Grand Canyon is a great place, we drove there in 2011 in August and had a great time. At this time of year the south and north rim parks will be closed for winter until April or May, 5000 ft elevation. South Arizona should be much warmer."
1022250,crappieperchhunter,2018-02-04 12:18:00,2582,"Cliff if you do the Grand Canyon I highly recommend a fly over package. Been to ""Lost Wages "" twice. First visit we did the fly over in a Cesna I believe....3 of us plus the pilot and our second trip it was the only thing I insisted that I do again. And if I ever go again I will be flying through the Canyon again. Another thing I have always wanted to do in Vegas. They use to have a barber shop called  ""A little off the top"" All the girls who cut your hair where topless. That ones still on my bucket list"
1022251,Big Cliff,2018-02-04 12:47:00,6899,"Fly over would also be one of the things I'd like to do but I have heard that these overnight mule trips can be a lot of fun, anyone on here ever done it> As for ""a little off the top"" I'd have to do that on the last day because I'd probably be inn jail right after that, you stick one of those things that close to my face and you know I'm going to revert right back to when I was a baby (crying and trying to suck on it )"
1022252,Big Cliff,2018-02-04 12:51:00,6899,"From what I have been reading there is still lots to do on the South rim even this time of the year, I was sort of thinking of heading that way about the end of Feb. early March, do you think I'd be better of delaying it to April/May?"
1022256,16 Footer,2018-02-04 13:55:00,191,Check the Grand Canyon Park web site for opening dates and info. April/May should be a better time to go. Lots of other places to see in north Arizona.  
1022257,Mister G,2018-02-04 13:59:00,1429,April is a GREAT time to be in the Vegas area. We've been there 15 years in a row and almost all in April.........haven't been there for 2 years now but going back this April. Temps are in the high 70's or low 80's at that time of year.
