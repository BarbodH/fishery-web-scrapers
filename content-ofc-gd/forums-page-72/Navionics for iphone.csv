1021258,turtle,2018-01-16 00:05:00,274,"I'm a new ""smart"" phone user and looking to put Navionics on my iphone.   I mostly fish Simcoe and Haliburton lakes and looking for good contour lines.  Is the Boating USA & Canada app the one I should put on the phone?  Thanks."
1021260,bobowski,2018-01-16 00:16:00,360,Its the one I use and it works great

1021263,LeXXington,2018-01-16 00:45:00,1928,great App
1021264,GBW,2018-01-16 00:48:00,8460,For those android users out there I too use it and it's very good.  They even added some smaller lakes recently like my folks lake that was never on it in the recent past
1021267,Joeytier,2018-01-16 03:03:00,3990,"Yep, I remember it being 17 bucks when I bought it.  Money well spent.  Very detailed depth charts."
1021270,buckhorn250,2018-01-16 11:03:00,85,It is a great app and worth the money...dont forget its an annual subscription.
1021271,turtle,2018-01-16 11:35:00,274,Thanks for the input.  Now I have to recruit a 10 year old child to help me set up my phone.  Never really embraced technology apart from relying on my flasher for catching perch. 
1021278,ROOK,2018-01-16 17:42:00,55,How do you go about renewing ???? thanks
1021282,GBW,2018-01-16 22:20:00,8460,On my android I've never paid again and it's updated
1021284,buckhorn250,2018-01-17 00:33:00,85,the app will notify you on an annual basis. It can be a bit misleading...ask you for the update...you may not notice that its charging your account the 17 bucks. I copied this from their app page....   Navionics+ is a one-year subscription. Download detailed maps by zooming in or from Menu>Download Map: Once mine expired I could see the maps but none of the contour details  
1021333,AKRISONER,2018-01-18 18:40:00,5558,remember to download yoru maps ahead of time...then you can turn your phone onto airplane mode and save some battery while its running...unless youve got a charger in the boat?
1021587,ROOK,2018-01-22 18:32:00,55,"I had downloaded the maps to my phone last year....did not get any notification to re-new though ....tried it this weekend and the maps are still on but it does NOT locate me on the maps...it also had  ""Navionics + Expired "" at the top of my map...still don't know how to re-new ??????????  ROOK"
1021606,GBW,2018-01-22 21:42:00,8460,"Check you settings, This is a first I've seen this that I have 300+ days left. "
1021650,KawarthaAngler,2018-01-23 14:39:00,273,It's a cool App.  I recently purchased it for $21 for my iPhone.  I loaded it with the lakes in the central Ontario area where I live/fish and it only took approx 100meg of space on the phone (not much).  It looks like just the Navionics on my Helix 7 and I think there may be a way to share info between the phone and Helix or Navionics SD card in the Helix ... but I'm not sure on that.
1021666,captpierre,2018-01-23 21:50:00,2521,Does anybody know how accurate the GPS is on an iPhone with the app?  Would it be as good as a sonar/GPS unit?
1021668,Gregoire,2018-01-24 00:32:00,1397,"I checked my iPhone app, and it seems as though mine does not expire. I bought it years ago, so maybe I am grandfathered in to the non subscription option?"
1021701,porkpie,2018-01-24 12:38:00,2521,"Yes, my particular phone is an iPhone 6, and I have in the past run with my humminbird mounted to the bars on my bike.  I've looked at the phone for consistency and it's pretty close.  A lot would have to do with how accurate the GPS is in your phone and or sonar.  I can say on Simcoe at least, it's pretty accurate as far as depth and location goes, But I've found a few areas that it's off. I'll say the phone app is certainly more detailed than the old hotmaps chip in my portable sonar!! I also have had the navionics app for a long time, never been charged for it.  Maybe I won't do another update?"
1021708,AKRISONER,2018-01-24 14:10:00,5558,"havent personally had too much of an issue...I have had problems with it knowing my bearing at times, I also have had a couple of experiences where i tracked off of course...but it quickly corrected...if you are driving new water that fast that a quick correction wont save you...The person driving like that probably deserves to lose the leg of their boat anyways."
