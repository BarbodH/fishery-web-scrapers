1021317,HTHM,2018-01-18 12:25:00,4082, THis is tough to watch.
1021319,Fisherman,2018-01-18 13:27:00,7201,Wonder what the outcome of the story is.  Somebody should be in jail.
1021320,Headhunter,2018-01-18 13:58:00,5703,I saw this on the news last night. Apparently the 75 year old driving the cruiser was on his cell phone... HH
1021321,AKRISONER,2018-01-18 14:55:00,5558,incredible these guys got away without a scratch...what a nightmare
1021326,BillM,2018-01-18 15:37:00,17367,Scary stuff.
1021329,G.mech,2018-01-18 16:52:00,830,Some of those marks aren't going to buff out.....
1021330,Whitespinnerbait,2018-01-18 17:16:00,2038,No Biggie !!!
1021337,aplumma,2018-01-18 20:10:00,6896,A good reminder that bigger boats have some bad blind spots. A horn should be on every boat regardless of size. The guy in the big boat was completely in the wrong  but that doesn't matter if the smaller boaters are hurt or killed. Be safe soft water season is coming.  Art
1021340,woodenboater,2018-01-18 20:41:00,2277,I wonder if this is a water version of a senior who shouldn't be behind the wheel ?
1021348,Old Ironmaker,2018-01-18 22:41:00,8243,"I just saw this on WBZ news Boston and posted it before I saw that Albert already did. The news reporter said there were serious injuries incurred. The operator f the Bayliner may have been on the phone and a law suit has been filed. No sound on the video above. That is beyond scary, it could have been anyone of us."

1021353,irishfield,2018-01-18 23:49:00,26272,Thought for a minute that Leah's old man got a new boat....
1021402,Rizzo,2018-01-19 23:23:00,4754,that is crazy. I am shocked how long they stayed in the boat. Looks like buddy in the front is still in the boat as it is being hit in the back. I would've jumped maybe a couple seconds earlier and swam down as deep as I could!
1021437,scuro2,2018-01-20 15:35:00,904,"A good visual argument for life jackets. Only one of the 3 were wearing them. Your last thought on this earth as you sink to the bottom of the lake shouldn't be, it's his fault!"
