The only problem is it's too wide for me to use my split rear seat allowing a third person to sit in the car. So with my wife out of town and the kids busy with stuff in the city I built colapsable aluminum smitty #2.     "
1021570,Cosmos,2018-01-22 15:22:00,588,Very nice. I would recommend to drill a holes for your rope in the center of ski top part. I found this make a lot of difference. 
1021576,NAW,2018-01-22 17:01:00,4022,That looks a little lighter then the last one!!  Looks slick man!Â  Ready for the long walks out to long shoal now??
1021583,Shloim,2018-01-22 17:56:00,515,"Oh I'm ready! The other is very light, it's just too wide.... Great to hook to the sled, only trouble is I don't have a sled... lol "
