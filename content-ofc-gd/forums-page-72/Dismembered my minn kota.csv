1022048,wkrp,2018-01-29 21:40:00,656,I took apart my old old minn kota powerdrive motor .  Man are those things ever built well and its no wonder it has served me well for so long. Looking to buy the new powerdrive 55 V2. Any comments good or bad ?
1022050,AKRISONER,2018-01-29 22:02:00,5558,"bah, spend the extra little bit of money and get the terova when it goes on sale...you wont regret it. Especially if you have never used ipilot...youd think its just gimmicky...but if you ever fish open water or in the wind at all, you will not regret it for a second."
1022063,Musky Plug,2018-01-30 01:34:00,398,X2 with the above post. Spend the extra cash and get the Terrova.
1022074,grt1,2018-01-30 04:11:00,638,"the i pilot is the greatest invention since sliced bread, just love mine "
1022075,Dutch01,2018-01-30 04:40:00,1431,I agree with the guys above. I had a Power Drive on my last boat and have a Terrova on my current boat. Even if it didn't have ipilot the Terrova would still be better. Ipilot is awesome on top of that. I don't use the foot pedal but I've heard the Terrova's is better too.
1022083,Lape0019,2018-01-30 13:50:00,647,The pedal design on the Terrova is by far better than the Powerdrive. I could never get used to that pedal. The lift assist on the newer Terrova's as well as the better designed deployment mechanism make it worth the extra few dollars.
1022084,AKRISONER,2018-01-30 14:07:00,5558,"this exactly...used a power drive with pedal, then used a powerdrive with ipilot...and now we have a terrova on the big boat...its not even close to comparable.  Plus lift assist is huge!"
1022085,wkrp,2018-01-30 14:18:00,656,"OK , now that you guys have me convinced, and pissed off  my wife. when do the minn kotas usually go on sale?"
1022088,Shloim,2018-01-30 14:50:00,515,"Call Joselyn at Angling Outfitters. Nice guy, great pricing and super service. Hes a big minn Kota deal;er "
1022093,Lape0019,2018-01-30 17:24:00,647,"I've never seen them listed as ""on sale"" (maybe Akrisoner will have more input on that) but Minnkota offers mail in rebates usually around this time every year."
1022094,DRIFTER_016,2018-01-30 17:26:00,10439,Might be able to get a decent deal @ The Spring Fishing show. https://springfishingandboatshow.com/
1022098,AKRISONER,2018-01-30 17:51:00,5558,https://www.sail.ca/en/minn-kota-terrova-80-us2-ip-bt-449754  got mine for 1700 from sail last fall.
1022102,captpierre,2018-01-30 21:05:00,2521,Sail stores have periodic sales. Last one was 20% off everything. Then in fine print 10 or 15 % off trolling motors. Will be sales during fishing/Sportsman Show.
1022104,msp,2018-01-30 21:15:00,1336,"I had a 70 # power drive for 10 years. worked well, lots of power. Problem is that I went through 3 pedals in ten years. last year Bought a newer power drive with the upgraded pedal ( a deal I couldn't refuse. I am now on my second pedal with this model. I agree with everyone above. Go with the Terova"
1022110,Joeytier,2018-01-31 13:46:00,3990,I initially read the thread title as 'dismembered BY minn kota'
1022209,Sinker,2018-02-03 20:00:00,8692,"I have had a powerdrive forever, but I am just waiting for the right deal to come along on the terrova lol  S."
