I fought the urge to head out early yesterday because the chores list was piling up. I almost didn't go yesterday because it was 3pm by the time I'd accomplished enough to go out guilt free but saw Manitou's post and had to go. I got on the ice at 3:30pm and by 5pm had a limit of walleye, got around 6 or 7 in total and had a blast. Weather was warm for a change so decided to sit in the open, love my shelter but so much nicer to be out in the open again!  "

Glad I inspired ya! I've been having a blast after a year hiatus! Pretty funny fishing on crutches ???"
