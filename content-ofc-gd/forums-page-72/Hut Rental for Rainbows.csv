1021135,Garnet,2018-01-12 16:40:00,2056,Was looking around Halliburton area for somebody doing hut rental for rainbows.
1021140,jimmer,2018-01-12 18:11:00,2730,I have never seen anyone renting huts for rainbows in that area.  Better to just pick one of the stocked lakes and head out with a pop up. Make sure you bring worms.

1021196,Old Ironmaker,2018-01-14 01:38:00,8243,The Caswell Hotel in Sundridge on Lake Bernard had a few huts for rent where we caught a few Rainbows  a few years back. Not Haliburton though. No transportation just a hut in deep water.
1021202,DRIFTER_016,2018-01-14 03:58:00,10439,Yes!!! If you want to crush tons of bows Manitoulin is the place to go. You even have the chance at some giants!!!
1021206,Garnet,2018-01-14 12:20:00,2056,Thanks guys not looking for major road trip. I have the equipment for walk out fishing just prefer more geriatric ice fishing these days.
1021215,Pikeslayer,2018-01-14 19:07:00,1443,"For your consideration......... https://limberlostforest.com/fishing/ if your interested, the reserve is owned by family friends & Gareth has a couple of lakeside simple cabins that can be booked for a day that are situated lakeside. Short walk from your vehicle onto a small stocked lake(s) with lakers, bows & brook trout. you do pay to play though "
