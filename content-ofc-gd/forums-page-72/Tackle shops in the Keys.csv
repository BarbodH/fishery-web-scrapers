1021345,Old Ironmaker,2018-01-18 22:18:00,8243,"There is nothing super cheap in the Keys Brian. You know I was there this month. Cut bait is cheap. There is nothing down there like BPS or Cabela's, if there is now I didn't see one. There are small Mom and Pop bait and tackle shops but stock very few items. Are you looking for rod's and reels and the like? As if you need more stuff, like us all. What are you looking for specifically?  Many times once I do the math the great prices south can be the same, even more than here at home. I remember a few years back when our friend Wormdunker bought a survival suit in the US, by the time he got it here it was more money, actually much more. Rest in peace Mr. Wormdunker, I miss you man."

I was in keys last year (not in BPS) and bought a few things from the local shops to use. Tackle shops along the highway-almost exclusively saltwater gear-stuff not found up here if that is what you are looking for. Agree there may not be many bargains but always fun to look around. -skdds
