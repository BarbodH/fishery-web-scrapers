1021657,grimsbylander,2018-01-23 18:49:00,3016,Nice looking units but yikes $$$! Those are USD!
1021659,dave524,2018-01-23 19:52:00,4508,"Nice , but a Webber Kettle is more in my budget."
1021667,grimsbylander,2018-01-23 22:22:00,3016,"I can buy 96 of these for the same money and my friends can help cook too!!! lol You're all invited! Joking aside, they're a neat looking design and very unique. "
1021679,dave524,2018-01-24 01:38:00,4508,"The concept got me to looking, wonder if I can find this aftermarket grate for the Weber in Canada???  Looks like it would work the same  "
1021687,woodenboater,2018-01-24 03:01:00,2277,"Mucho buckaroos but it does look like a fun way to burn some meat and prawn lol, if you're flush. The grill insert would work well on my Webers and could be one way to get around fire pit issues in the city. Put the kettle on short feet and it'd be a cozy fire in the backyard"
1021688,irishfield,2018-01-24 03:30:00,26272,Jen would have never done her popcorn on that thing Rob !! 
1021689,GBW,2018-01-24 03:41:00,8460,"Can make one with a steel rim (burn area) and then a section of steel (circle) cut to be the top cooking area for a decent price as there are may ideas posted how to via a quick google search of ""round cook top fire pit"""

1021724,Loonietoon,2018-01-24 17:19:00,1450,"Wayne, Jen was a different type of gal, like her mother she knew how she wanted things done.... look at you lol"
