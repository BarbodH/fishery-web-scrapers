1021334,AKRISONER,2018-01-18 18:41:00,5558,glad to see you had more luck than i did with your buddies out there...who knows maybe ill run into ya some day out there.

In summer and fall fish are 50-65ft down in Northern Ontario lakes, they are almost black when they come up from the dark depths. After 15-30 mins on the stringer in Sept with 50F water, they change from coal black to light grey in colour.  We keep our eaters and limit in a fish cage 10 feet down when water is 50F spring and fall. They live for 3-4 day trip. Black fish as caught are light grey when we clean them. They change shades/colours to match their surroundings over a period of 10-15 mins."
