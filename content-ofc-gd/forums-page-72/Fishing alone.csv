1020207,pics,2017-12-23 03:14:00,1268,"Since I am a shift worker I tend to fish alone. Most of my days off are during the week and none of the guys on my crew really fish.. If I wanted someone to go to the gun range with mid-week , now that's a different story...."
1020209,Fish Farmer,2017-12-23 11:38:00,2234,"After a all day, I don't think I could do an all nighter, getting to old for that stuff. The way I look at it, cost the same in gas if you do a half day or a full day on the water, price of gas is pricey these days. Besides, doing a half what are you going to do the rest of the day (watch Judge Judy) I'll stay, I might catch the second bite. I'm retired, I get up around 5 am in the morning, can't be calling people at that time to go fishing so I load the boat and 15 min's I'm on Lake Ont. or 45 Min's on Erie. Going solo you can experiment different techniques. But I do enjoy company on other days. "

1020219,Ralph Field,2017-12-23 14:17:00,1018,"I fish alone most of the time but I know I shouldn't. If I get in trouble or fall when alone there is no one to help me, which wasn't a concern when . I was healthier and younger."
1020221,SaugaPikeSlayer,2017-12-23 14:46:00,48,"You are not alone. I deal with other peoples' problems all day long at work. I enjoying nothing more than popping in the earbuds, walking down to the lake to enjoy the solitude and maybe catch a fish or two. Some people meditate or go to the gym to blow off steam...I load up my favourite bands in my phone's playlist and toss Rapalas. "
1020255,smithy97,2017-12-23 23:06:00,70,Curious - what bands are you listening to? Off topic I know...
1020258,Bill Shearer,2017-12-24 00:14:00,456,"Honestly I’m somewhat surprised that the safety issue is not a primary concern among those that responded. Whether you are on a huge lake or a small one, big river or smaller stream. If you can’t get yourself to safety in less than five minutes then weather conditions will determine how long you will live. I confess that my cognizance of this fact didn’t hit home until I was drifting down a BC river miles from  the remotest chance of help. Wake up call for sure. For me."
1020264,dave524,2017-12-24 13:20:00,4508,"Years ago a friend and I would rent a motel room for a week in the fall in Meaford for steelheading, the first year we went in 1 vehicle , after that we took both vehicles and compared notes when meeting for lunch or in the evening, guess we were both fish alone people.  edit: actually the same friend and I would fish separate boats alone with radio contact out of Grimsby all summer for salmon and trout as well, cover more water"
1020290,lunkerbasshunter,2017-12-25 08:50:00,2585,I love to fish with my son.  however there is something so amazing about going out on the water at 5am as the sun comes up just by myself or with my dog Cheers!
1020570,msp,2017-12-31 19:17:00,1336,I will also be solo for most of the spring pike bite. Let me know if you need a partner. i do like being solo sometimes. Makes for a real long day tho

1021464,Dutch01,2018-01-21 08:07:00,1431,"Albert Einstein was, in my estimation, the most brilliant man that ever lived. He didn't have a lab full of instruments or any assistants. He worked a shift in a patent office, and his boss let him stay late to work on his own ideas. The result of his thought experiments remains to this day the most comprehensive understanding of the physics of the universe we have. That is undoubtedly his finest achievement, but he also understood some things about humanity. He once said ""I live in that solitude which is painful in youth, but delicious in the years of maturity."" I think I know what he means. The older I get, the more I appreciate time fishing alone."
1021466,Big Cliff,2018-01-21 10:44:00,6899,"I do enjoy fishing solo but I am very fortunate to have a few friends that I really enjoy spending time fishing with and I love sharing the experience with. I also remember a couple of years ago and I was out ice fishing, I slipped and fell, hit my head and knocked myself out cold. I was sure glad I had a buddy with me that day because when I came too I had no idea where I was or what had happened. it took me a couple of hours to shake it off. I could have been in serious trouble had I been alone out there."
1020075,LostAnotherOne,2017-12-21 01:41:00,956,"Am i the only one who enjoys this.  Im close with my bro but hes a little bossy when on the water.  The wife loves fishing and enjoy hitting the lake with her, but our working schedules dont always allow it.  Ever since i got my first car i have always loved going solo to whatever fishing spot i choose.  Not sure why"
1020078,Acountdeleted,2017-12-21 01:51:00,2562,I'm like that on the ice sometimes. Nothing but the sounds of nature and the grip of frostbite. The silence can be so peaceful.
1020079,SirCranksalot,2017-12-21 01:54:00,3291,I really prefer not to be alone on the ice.
1020082,bigugli,2017-12-21 02:20:00,6138,"I like the solitude, but I also enjoy the company of like minded souls."

1020087,16 Footer,2017-12-21 11:05:00,191,I like to be with outdoors people/friends any time of the year otherwise I enjoy being myself to see nature's display.
1020088,Canuck,2017-12-21 11:27:00,491,Both for me. When trolling on the big lake I prefer company cause its a bit boring at times.  Walking the creeks I like the solitude.  Same for early morning fishing the shallows for pike or bass.  Its nice to be alone and hear it all.
1020090,NAW,2017-12-21 12:11:00,4022,"I love fishing alone. I'm like you where my girlfriend works a schedule different than mine,  She works every other weekend, and the kids are at the other parents houses.  So I basically spend every other weekend alone.  I really like getting out on the ice solo.  But I also really love solo camping from the kayak.  No radio.  Cell phone turned off."
1020091,fishindevil,2017-12-21 12:19:00,6254,95% of the time I fish alone as not many people will do 12-17hrs on the water and I travel a lot and sometimes will drive 3hrs to hit some lakes and fish all over and in the summer months that means being on the road a lot at 3am.......
1020098,oldphart,2017-12-21 14:01:00,665,"~~~~I don't drive so I depend on others for transportation, enjoy their company, bit there are times I like to close up my hut, and have some of the best naps on the ice ever"
1020099,crappieperchhunter,2017-12-21 14:11:00,2582,I enjoy both....but one of my favourites is walking out on the ice solo after an overnight snowfall and being the first set of tracks out on the new snow.
1020103,bobowski,2017-12-21 14:24:00,360,When I ice fish (on safe ice) I enjoy being alone. Even when I do ice fish with buddies they often aren't in talking distance anyways. On the soft water I enjoy fishing with other people. We can cover more water as well.
1020118,Sinker,2017-12-21 19:26:00,8692,"Most of my fishing now is done with my better half, so when I do get to go solo, I actually catch fish, so yeah, I like fishing solo LOL  S."
1020119,misfish,2017-12-21 21:04:00,29133,"I am a solo guy. If someone cares to join, that is fine, just keep your distance. LOL"
1020122,Fisherman,2017-12-21 21:15:00,7201,Solo unless it's people I'm comfortable with.  Sometimes the jokes and topics can be a little off the deep end.
1020125,LostAnotherOne,2017-12-21 21:21:00,956,Another bonus going solo is that fish you catch is that much bigger lol
1020127,Bill Shearer,2017-12-21 21:39:00,456,"I have fished with the same guy for 50 years! We commonly split up on the rivers to zero in on the fish. We know that if we haven't seen each other after 20-30 minutes we better find where the other is, as he's probably into fish. We never needed cell phones to communicate. The system usually works very well. When we do fish the same run/pool, we always use different baits and tactics. Beads/bags/jigs/heavy trotting/loose drift etc. It really helps to make a good day better, most of the time. The other factor is the safety issue. We fish pretty remote spots sometimes, and just knowing there is someone who can call for help, or assist in getting back to the car is great insurance."
1020137,Rizzo,2017-12-21 23:48:00,4754,Often solo...but when I go to St Clair to musky fish its always 3 of us. Helps on the big gas bill but also lets you troll with 6 lines! Hard to get skunked with that many lines in the drink (notice I said hard...not impossible)
1020138,scuro2,2017-12-21 23:56:00,904,When fishing a method that allows for tons of experimentation like trolling for lakers in the deep I like to experiment alone. Whereas heavy casting I like a partner to make the time go by..
1020146,BillM,2017-12-22 00:56:00,17367,"I love fishing with my oldman, the older he gets the more and more I enjoy it.   I do like solo trips however.  It looks like this spring I'll be by myself hunting for big pike, should be a fun week."
1020147,Fish Farmer,2017-12-22 00:58:00,2234,"I fish lots solo, my buddys call me all-day-Dave. My days are to long for them."
1020148,smithy97,2017-12-22 01:03:00,70,"There is no better feeling than being out solo, casting for muskies or bass. I love the peaceful solitude. I love not having to go by anyone else's schedule but my own. That being said, I have a couple buddies equally as ""hard-core"" as me, so fishing with them every now and then is a blast. Whenever my wife happens to comes out with me, we enjoy our time together for sure. But, I'll always be a solo angler at heart."
1020157,DanD,2017-12-22 12:50:00,2223,"Last year was the first time I had ever ice fished alone; it wasn't planed, it just worked out that way. There were four of us up on Simcoe for the weekend; but Sunday came way to fast for my liking and I decided to stay a couple extra days. What a difference it was, no one banging and clanging stuff around; looking do doing something. The furnace only came on half the time; without someone constantly opening the door. I could actually concentrate on fishing and day dreaming. Once there's stable ice, to get the hut out; there will be at least a few solo days for me. After saying all that, I would still miss not having a few friends and family out there with me; most times. LOL Dan."
1020159,grimsbylander,2017-12-22 14:02:00,3016,"What a coincidence! I'm all-night-Dave! LOL yeah right! I fish alone most of the time. With me, it's usually the day before when I decide to go so it doesn't give anyone else enough notice. But I'm good either way, I like the company but enjoy the solitude. I think it goes back to bowhunting where I spent thousands of hours alone."
1020160,mike rousseau,2017-12-22 14:49:00,4661,I usually try to find someone to fish with cause I enjoy spending time with Friends and family and I believe we have limited opportunities in life to do so that being said... the days everyone is busy and I can’t find a fishing partner  I do enjoy the peace and quiet of fishing alone when fishing alone I tend to learn the most... experiment with new techniques... try new spots... etc...
