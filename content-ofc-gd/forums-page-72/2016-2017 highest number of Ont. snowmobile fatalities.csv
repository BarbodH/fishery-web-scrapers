Be careful out there guys and gals. https://www.thestar.com/news/canada/2018/01/22/last-winter-had-most-snowmobile-related-deaths-in-ontario-in-almost-15-years-opp-say.html

Ive got a couple 500SS's and you can easily kill yourself on those things in the blink of an eye, i couldnt imagine riding the new 800R's No different than a highly overpowered streetbike, except in this case you are driving it offroad...insanity I know of far too many stories of people dying on sleds considering the amount of people that i know that actually ride snowmobiles...the ratio tells the story outright."
