I've got my plan all laid out for perch, walleye and herring but then I got to thinking about Burbot.  I remember before a few people mentioning that to hook up with Burbot, a nice dead minnow on the bottom of the lake works well but I was wondering, how late should I fish for them? I mean. don't get me wrong, I'd pull an all nighter if I thought I could staring at the hole waiting for a bite, but I figure I should get sleep at some point in time. For everyone/anyone that has had success can you share some pointers?  Thanks."
1021784,AKRISONER,2018-01-25 13:42:00,5558,"only time ive caught burbs, sand flats with a deadsticked minnow sitting right on bottom and it was night time"
1021799,Cosmos,2018-01-25 17:32:00,588,Best think you can do is to put a tipups with big junk of meat of couple big minnows. I had a lot of luck fishing for burbot on nippising this way.
1021802,DRIFTER_016,2018-01-25 18:05:00,10439,Glow spoons with a minnow jigged near bottom are deadly on burbies.
1021806,Acountdeleted,2018-01-25 18:48:00,2562,"Thanks guys. Drifter, do you dead stick or do you move them at all? Also do you 'Charge' them before you send them down? I remember I was with Simon (Pikeslayer) on early morning for Chinook on Lake O and he had us charging up the lures with a fluorescent flashlight.  (I think I have a few glow spoons but I'll have to check)"
1021828,misfish,2018-01-25 22:59:00,29133,One word  BACON  Have a great time bud. The whities miss you.
1021832,Joeytier,2018-01-26 00:44:00,3990,"Youre overthinking it Jer.  Whatever you were using for walleye before sundown, just keep it down there. They're super aggressive and predatorial.  Glow spoons like buckshots tipped with a minnow arr probably the best, but they're not picky."
1021834,Acountdeleted,2018-01-26 01:15:00,2562,"Sweet. Thanks Joey. Was hoping you would chime in on this.  B, end of Feb or March I'll make sure to visit for a morning. Save some whities for me."
