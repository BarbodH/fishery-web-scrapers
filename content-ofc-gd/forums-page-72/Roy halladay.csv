1017483,SaugaPikeSlayer,2017-11-12 18:57:00,48,"Let's start banning sports cars too.  Proper training, maintenance, attitude and respect for your machine prevents this sort of thing."
1017484,SaugaPikeSlayer,2017-11-12 18:58:00,48,.
1017493,Old Ironmaker,2017-11-12 20:43:00,8243,"No we shouldn't ban all sports cars only the ones that explode in flames when hit from the rear as they did the Chevy Corvair in the 60's and another that I think was a Ford that had the same issues, Mavericks I think, someone here remembers. We shouldn't ban all sports planes either, just the one that have claimed 3 lives in the past month. Like I said I can't quantify the ratio of crashes to flight hours of the Icon A5. That number would be interesting to see. This sports aircraft has a very limited number of them in the air and an unusually high number of crashes. Yes they should be grounded and if found to be unsafe to fly banned. I agree 110% that proper training, maintenance attitude and respect for any machine makes it safer to operate but the Icon A5 was marketed to be flown irresponsibly in my opinion.  It might all be a moot point as this company is most likely going out of business. With all the recent crashes and bad press whom in their right mind will buy one now?"
1017512,FloatnFly,2017-11-13 00:27:00,1640,Funeral service will be broadcast on sportsnet @3pm Tuesday
1017514,manitoubass2,2017-11-13 00:59:00,11391,"I don't wanna say anything bad about Roy, he's deceased and left a family and alot if friends behind.  But, many said he was flying the machine in very risky ways. Can't blame that on the plane that possible couldn't handle such manuevers.  Kinda like letting me lose on the Autobahn in a super car, odds are I'm gonna end up in an obituary.  But OI I totally agree the marketing is waaaaay off. I'd also agree they aren't around this time next year.  Very very irresponsible marketing IMO"
1017523,Old Ironmaker,2017-11-13 03:11:00,8243,I won't comment let alone criticise on how Mr. Halliday was flying because I don't know. I do know that you wouldn't let a 16 year old that just got their licence let loose on a public road or track in that Bugatti Supercar that can hit the same speeds as a Formula 1 and Indy car. I think that is a fair comparison in my mind.
1017525,manitoubass2,2017-11-13 03:21:00,11391,"Yeah, that basically echoes my views"
1017526,FloatnFly,2017-11-13 03:24:00,1640,"Eyewitnesses can only guess, ill wait for the flight data from the ntsb before guessing on his flying"
1017527,irishfield,2017-11-13 03:46:00,26272,"OI.. you're way off track and out of line IMHO. Take that from a guy that got a call from Parry Sound OPP to do the accident investigation for TC and to collect my best friends belongings for his wife some years back. Similar style aircraft (amphibious rear pusher), that crashed into the rock face on the back side of Picnic Island,. He went through his windshield breaking his neck and instantly killing him.  Sometimes crap just happens to the best of them. Not once did I think I should immediately call for a grounding and ban of all similar aircraft. Mother nature got him and some poor choices, one being not wearing his seat belt during landing because he was afraid he'd drown if he flipped.  As for Icon... they're probably not going anywhere soon. You won't see many, if any, cancelling their long awaited orders for their new toys!"
1017528,Old Ironmaker,2017-11-13 05:32:00,8243,"  I think out of line is a bit harsh Wayne. It was you that questioned the integrity of the plane above. I quote ""Yep , the Icon A5 kills another needlessly."" You said that not me and taking your experience into consideration I took that to mean this thing isn't safe. I misunderstood your view obviously.  I've been around a while too and at 25 years old had to go to a friends Mom's and kid brother and sisters home to tell them I just identified their loved ones body on the side of the road after a car accident coming out of the plant, I waited for the Police to accompany me and they never showed up, not even latter that night, December 13th 1979 4:15 PM. I was as well the G.F. from the department that went with H.R. the Police and a Minister to a co workers home to notify them that their husband was killed on the job because I knew the families well, twice. We all have tragedies we can recount but would rather forget Sir.  If I offended you it wasn't my intent. It was my intent to vent when I hear of what I feel is a needless death. I won't apologize for my personal opinion."
1017667,FloatnFly,2017-11-15 13:08:00,1640,"Watched the funeral service, the stories were great from former teammates. why someone thought it was a good idea to chop onions, I don't know"
1021413,irishfield,2018-01-20 02:00:00,26272,Certainly can't blame the aircraft on this one... [/img]
1021418,manitoubass2,2018-01-20 03:07:00,11391,Wow that's alot of serious drugs. Zolpidem +morphine???? Probably sleeping
1021421,Toronto_Angler,2018-01-20 04:01:00,698,They were detected in his blood stream doesn't mean he was currently under the influence. If he was using them to sleep they would still be detected the next day.
1021423,irishfield,2018-01-20 05:31:00,26272,"1/2 the stuff listed is aviation medical invalidating and he should have self grounded. Sounds like he got what he was after, maybe he had a double indemnity clause on his life insurance for accidental death."
1021424,BillM,2018-01-20 05:43:00,17367,Sounds like he was flying like an ass and paid the price.  Case closed.
1021430,manitoubass2,2018-01-20 13:05:00,11391,"True, but they'd also have ppm and know exactly how much of what and when was taken."
1021451,moxie,2018-01-20 22:02:00,1566,Im guessing he's still dead right? Does it matter?
1021452,moxie,2018-01-20 22:05:00,1566,By the way. Bill nailed it. Video says it all.
1021569,grimsbylander,2018-01-22 15:18:00,3016,Hearing about rich celebraties and sports stars ending their lives because of poor lifestyle choices is getting old. It seems like buckets of money = superman syndrome.
1017125,manitoubass2,2017-11-07 21:25:00,11391,Tragic.  He has died in an plane crash  RIP
1017127,John Bacon,2017-11-07 21:36:00,3277,Sad news for Blue Jay fans.  https://ca.sports.yahoo.com/roy-halladay-killed-plane-crash-age-40-211714002.html
1017129,irishfield,2017-11-07 22:48:00,26272,"Yep , the Icon A5 kills another needlessly. Sad day for the Halladay family."
1017138,Old Ironmaker,2017-11-08 01:37:00,8243,"Oh no, didn't hear that today. He was one of my favorite Pitchers when I was a Baseball fan. Sad for the family and his fans, condolences. 2 time Cy Young winner, the man was talented. 40 years young, what a waste.  Irish, I denote a sentiment that the aircraft isn't the safest. Am I right?  Just looked at the plane, very unique I think with that rear prop. Just the other day a similar plane flew along the shoreline. We see aircraft constantly as they use the shoreline as a road map I guess and they fly very low, low enough where the Pilot waves back. Never recall seeing one like it before."
1017142,FloatnFly,2017-11-08 04:46:00,1640,"This one hit me hard, he was my idol and a source of inspiration during my playing days, he was about as near perfect as a pitcher could get"
1017144,manitoubass2,2017-11-08 05:14:00,11391,"Yeah, this was like a Payne stewart for me too.  I think Roy was hands down one of if not the best pitchers in the 2000s and one of the best of all time"
1017185,leaf4,2017-11-08 22:48:00,2466,"Too sad. Had a whole life to live still. At work one of the guys on site told me Roy was in a commercial for that plane, and his wife also said something along the lines of I was hesitant and said no to him having this as a hobby ....  Should've followed her gut feeling  Yikes... He only just got the thing last month, and apparently the lead engineer died in a crash in one ?"
1017189,irishfield,2017-11-08 23:20:00,26272,"..and their test pilot! Their entire marketing style is wrong, selling them as PWC's with wings.. trolling for the young / hipster / with money.  Roy paid a premium to take delivery of serial #001 for the 2018 model year, that and who better to advertise their aircraft for free. His was the first hull that Icon actually did the composite layup in their new inhouse facilty (2017's where outsourced). I was actually hoping to see that it was an inflight break up due to improper composite work, but it appears Roy was hotdogging and stuffed it into the bay. The NTSB report will tell the tale, but that will take a year probably."
1017236,Old Ironmaker,2017-11-09 04:07:00,8243,"A aircraft that size would not require a Cockpit Voice Recorder I assume, it did have Flight Data recorders. Other than the press conference's anything I have read is unconfirmed Internet rumours, at this point I would call them rumours. I I read and they have been recovered. I also have read he was a well seasoned pilot since his youth then I read that he was forbidden to take up aviation until his Baseball career was over. Licensed in 2013.  Irish, what kind of speeds and G's would that thing do planting a nosedive into the water?"
1017281,captpierre,2017-11-09 21:30:00,2521,"Im no pilot but flying close to ground / water leaves no room for error in case of turbulence, downdraft or mechanical problems. I thought highly of Doc as a player and human being. Got to wonder what he was thinking in that bird."
1017289,Old Ironmaker,2017-11-09 22:11:00,8243,"Did anyone hear the rant by Michael Felder a Boston sports talk radio idiot about Roy Halliday's death? I couldn't believe what I was hearing, this guy has to be the biggest jack wad since I last listened to the guy that runs the country we border on.  Guess what Michael Felger said today, ""I'm sorry, I feel bad."" But then said he meant much of what he said. Which part Duffus? Calling him a moron and he deserved it, and he was asking for it, what exactly?  This guy must really hate his job and wants to get a real job where one has to work for a living.

1017297,BassMan11,2017-11-09 23:37:00,583,The plane was amphibious so there could be a chance he could have been looking to land on the water. Me got be the reason he was flying low. I have been in one of those types of planes. A super Petrell which is the same type of plane. They are very cool to fly in.

1017334,Cast-Away,2017-11-10 13:51:00,790,The plane actually has a deployable parachute but you have to be at a decent elevation in order to deploy it. https://www.iconaircraft.com/a5 Wayne is right they are appealing to a young market with this product.   Here is a link where people were recording his flying and sadly the crash. There is also a promo video that his wife and him recorded for Icon. http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-5062213/Roy-Halladay-fly-Icon-A5-crash.html
1017340,fish_fishburn,2017-11-10 15:48:00,1311,You would think these scum who arrived first would at least check for survivors first instead od videoing the scene.

1017417,Old Ironmaker,2017-11-11 19:15:00,8243,Until someone faces the same circumstances you don't know what you would do. You would think the first thing would be for at least someone to jump in the water instead of narrating with foul language. There wasn't fire to contend with. Stress and shock makes people do strange things. Some will run into a fire to try and save a life but most will run away. The video guy and his crew should remain nameless for their own good but I can't be too critical here. Hopefully Ray Halliday was killed instantly and didn't drown while conscious.  I hope that that company goes under and I am positive it will go under and never sell one of these weapons again. They should be ashamed to market them the way they have. The number of crashes to hours in the air must be an astronomical ratio. Any of these things still out there should be grounded immediately and permanently.
1017426,grimsbylander,2017-11-11 20:25:00,3016,"Hmmm, I watched the flight video and heard/read all the commentary too...let's just say my opinion doesn't align with public opinion. A terrible loss...RIP Doc"

There is enough hate in this world no one needs to listen to this animal, and they pay him to do it! An article that appeared today in part.   “Was it Dale Earnhardt who died? The race car driver who died? I root for the wall. I really do. That ain’t no tragedy ... I’m supposed to feel bad for you? Give me a break. Oh God,” he sai   NBC Sports Boston has since suspended Felger from going on air through Sunday, according to the Boston Herald. Felger traditionally hosts the New England Patriots pre- and postgame shows, though he won't be doing either for this Sunday's game against the Denver Broncos. NBC Sports released the following statment regarding Felger's comments:  “As a result of his insensitive comment about Roy Halladay and Dale Earnhardt on Wednesday, Michael Felger will not appear on NBC Sports Boston, effective immediately through Sunday. While we don’t have editorial control of the content of his radio show, which we simulcast, Felger’s comments are not representative of our network’s views or standards.”"
