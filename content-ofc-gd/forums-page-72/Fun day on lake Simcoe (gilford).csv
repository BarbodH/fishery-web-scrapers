We caught on the first drop of the line.  2nd drop caught my PB perch. was around 13 inch jumbo! The bite shut down until 2pm and then slowly picked up. from 3:45 to 4:30 it was non stop action. We couldn't  take our eyes off our lines.  As soon as we send a fresh minnows down, we would get bite!  We felt like string puppeteers lol. Most were smaller size perch but well worth it! During the above mentioned rush hour, I was looking down the hole and saw a grayish looking fish circling around my minnow.  It finally took the bait and I reeled in my my first ever Herring!  Beautiful fish and very aggressive on the bite. We had a CO visit us as well  Good thing I reminded my friend tor renew his license on the drive up to Gilford! First time ever getting a visit from CO on the ice! Was not the most productive day size wise, but indeed a day to remember! I think its safe my friend is sold on ice fishing! in the end we hooked probably 30 fish."

1022015,AKRISONER,2018-01-29 13:01:00,5558,glad you guys caught some decent ones. Maybe your friend will get addicted and you will have a new fishing partner
1022042,huzzsaba,2018-01-29 20:44:00,884, Thanks. I have got a few fishing buddies but none as patient as this one.  We have gone on at least 8-10 trips in the last few years (shore fishing) and poor guy never caught a thing despite doing everything right! Yet he never gives up and even encourages me on the slow days. He caught his first perch that day and the smile on his face was priceless.  He was telling me how that first fish was what made the whole trip worth it.  He had to take the day off work and I was glad it paid off.
