1021761,gordy28,2018-01-25 01:23:00,638,That was an awesome video and an incredible fish Watched it with my daughter and the first small fish she was not so impressed.  With the last fish she said.  Wow Daddy that’s huge. You’ve never caught a trout like that lol Thanks for posting. Gordy
1021768,Joeytier,2018-01-25 03:52:00,3990,Okay that made me laugh!!
1021776,limeyangler,2018-01-25 10:59:00,5204,Awesome fish and video JT.
1021788,Sinker,2018-01-25 14:36:00,8692,"The ole stick and string never fails. I still use it too. Always works. Great video, and beauty fish!!  S."
1021790,AKRISONER,2018-01-25 14:43:00,5558,"saw this on the grams...im confused Joey, do you live up north or just venture there a lot?"
1021797,camillj,2018-01-25 16:59:00,1988,OK .... so I tried every trick in the book to snarp the UTM's ... no luck ... Anyhow absolutely awesome video (and fish) ...thanks for sharing .... won't sleep now till my next outing
1021811,cl_fishin,2018-01-25 20:01:00,138,"Well done, some very nice Brookies......subbed"
1021831,Joeytier,2018-01-26 00:29:00,3990,"I live up north, and drive even further north for da brookies."
1021590,Joeytier,2018-01-22 19:31:00,3990,  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ApmdyXiCY74&feature=youtu.be  We broke 'trail' (using that term loosely)  into a remote brook trout lake in Northern Ontario and caught a pair of big brook trout on primitive rigs.  I was so happy to be able to capture the entire battle and landing of such a special fish on camera.     
1021591,NAW,2018-01-22 19:41:00,4022,Great Video Joey!!! 
1021593,canoecarrier,2018-01-22 19:50:00,54,Gorgeous fish! You are a good man for putting that fish back. She is even looking at the camera for the picture! haha!
1021594,Tomcat,2018-01-22 19:57:00,395,Outstanding video. Thanks for sharing.
1021595,Joeytier,2018-01-22 19:59:00,3990,"Thank you...a brook trout of that size will likely die of old age in less than a year's time, but I was not interested in mounting it, and they get pretty nasty tasting when they reach that size, so back she went.  Hopefully someone else will be able to catch her before she croaks."
1021596,grimsbylander,2018-01-22 20:02:00,3016,Wow...very impressive!!
1021604,Old Ironmaker,2018-01-22 21:32:00,8243,"Very nice Joey. What a beauty!!!! 4 pounds minimum, probably closer to 5. When you don't have a tape hold the fish to the tip of your finger at it's head and hold it up your arm and make note where the tail ends. Then measure that latter. I have to ask how in Hell can you catch quality fish without many hundreds of dollars of electronics and tackle. 13 minutes is perfect for a fishing video by the way."
1021610,can u fish,2018-01-22 23:23:00,326,Well it looks like you had a great outing Joey thanks for sharing really enjoyed the video great looking brookies. Cheers Mitch
1021613,buick14,2018-01-22 23:45:00,741,Very very impressive! Good for you that’s incredible !
1021616,Freshtrax,2018-01-23 00:19:00,2215,Nice fish ! 
1021617,sleepjigging,2018-01-23 00:27:00,207,Now why do we spend hundreds on gear when it can be done with just sticks ?! Nice fishies. 
1021618,manitoubass2,2018-01-23 00:41:00,11391,That's friggen epic Joey! Unreal fish!  I really need to do a trip and just go back to the old methods for a day just for old time sake. My brother in law caught a pretty nice pike on a stick this weekend.  Congrats on a beauty! Sure makes the leg work worth it!
1021621,misfish,2018-01-23 01:51:00,29133,Great outing Joey. Some nice eats  as well. Enjoyed it very much
1021629,Joeytier,2018-01-23 02:58:00,3990,There's definitely something magical about fooling a trophy trout in a small remote lake on super simple gear.
1021631,smitty55,2018-01-23 05:04:00,928,"That's a beauty Speck Joey. Congrats on the PB. We always called them switches, and that's all we use when fishing back lakes since the late 70's. They can be super sensitive when thin enough. I always like to be able to see the minnow swimming at the tip. One of my buds used them for everything. Cheers"
1021633,Chuck Enwinde,2018-01-23 06:26:00,247,Awesome fish Joey.  Slick video too.
1021635,Joeytier,2018-01-23 09:53:00,3990,"Yea!  I've heard people call 'em switches, or gads."
1021639,fishindevil,2018-01-23 12:44:00,6254,nice vid man you had em dialed in for sure...for many years I used sticks and loved it.....congrats for putting that tank back.....cheers
1021647,Sterling,2018-01-23 14:21:00,477,Love the video. Cheers on the release.
1021651,Rod Caster,2018-01-23 15:16:00,5784,All the hours you spent fishing specks without a camera on you.... all you needed was an audience to catch your trophies!
1021669,msp,2018-01-24 00:39:00,1336,Great video. Well done and congrats . Love the simplicity of it all
1021674,chris.brock,2018-01-24 00:50:00,4053," That could be the Ontario record ""twig"" brook trout. What a tank! Damn, makes me want to go back lake ice fishing asap."
1021719,Acountdeleted,2018-01-24 15:49:00,2562,"Way to go Joey. Fish of a lifetime. And you let her see a few more years, or at least one more hook in her mouth. "
1021725,JoshS,2018-01-24 17:23:00,729,That's a beauty fish!! Back to basics... I like it. It's nice to just bring a few items and catch fish.
1021750,Joeytier,2018-01-24 22:23:00,3990,Nice things tend to break on trips like these lol ?
