I will put up a 6-pack as a prize for the biggest fish. If we have to deliver the prizes Uncut Angling style even better. The winner shall be declared by vote in this forum in case of dispute. Date of vote to be determined at the end of ice out. Post your video on this thread to enter the contest. "
