1021365,tedley,2018-01-19 04:37:00,36,Is there anywhere to get minnows at Lake Temagami hub other than driving out to Gramps?
1021373,irishfield,2018-01-19 14:26:00,26272,"Not that I know of, but try calling Loon Lodge.... they'd know."
1021375,tedley,2018-01-19 15:18:00,36,"Thanks just got back from gramps, now to find the fish"
1021377,irishfield,2018-01-19 17:42:00,26272,Good luck.. how much snow is on the ice surface??? Any slush fields???
1021381,tedley,2018-01-19 19:15:00,36,"No much snow, enough for snowmobile, can drive 4x4 pretty much anywhere, over 2 ft of ice, no slush"
1021386,Terry,2018-01-19 19:47:00,14456,"now, that's what i wanted to hear"
1021393,Woodsman,2018-01-19 21:57:00,1286,If you can get to some of the back lakes try setting up a minnow trap near the shore just under the ice. That's how the locals get their minnows.
1021420,irishfield,2018-01-20 03:10:00,26272,"What I wanted to hear as well Terry, but 4 days of snow in the forecast near future. Hoping we can all drive out to the dock, as we can't park in either of the towns water side parking lot without being towed apparently this year! "
1021446,Joeytier,2018-01-20 20:17:00,3990,"I drove my sled way down Temagami yesterday...80% bare ice.  With a passenger and sleigh full of gear, I could barely do 30 km/hr.  Will be nice when the snow drops Monday, everywhere needs it."
1021455,misfish,2018-01-21 00:06:00,29133,"Guess you,ll be missing the great white fish bite again. LMAO"
