479861,alexcba,2010-06-27 03:30:00,634,so my buddies and i decided to go out to rice and brave the storm of boats out on the water lol. did some drop shotting but mostly just tossed cranks on to structure.  we got there at 6am and tied up our lines and set out. we caught a mixed bag of fish everything from small mouth to catfish on crank baits lol. i ended up with about 15 fish just uploaded a few pics enjoy.        bullhead on a live target perch lol           
479875,LegitFish,2010-06-27 04:12:00,69,Haha catfish!
479907,Garry2Rs,2010-06-27 11:42:00,1425,Nice mixed bag!
479936,alexcba,2010-06-27 13:46:00,634,thanks garry it was an entertaining day.. didn't realize how much variety that live target perch could attract.. just insane.
480726,Guest Johnny Bass,2010-06-29 12:39:00,0,Looks like you caught a bit of everything. I have never caught a catfish on a crankbait. Thanks for sharing.
480731,fishing_noob,2010-06-29 12:51:00,12,how good does the berkley gulp spray work? nice pics
480735,blaque,2010-06-29 13:03:00,2419,"Nice mixed bag.........try waiting until they get outta the frying pan though before you chomp on them, they taste better that way.    Also a little cherry lipgloss goes a long way when kissing them. Beautiful shore line you have therer for crankin baits."
480821,alexcba,2010-06-29 16:23:00,634,"fishing_noob: the spray works alright, i've noticed a difference with and without it. the fish hold it a bit longer and hit a little harder i find. plus like sinclair said.. catfish on a crank bait lol! he nailed it with ferocity to! i was casting into 16 fow and retrieving at about 8 when that cat slammed it after a fresh spray.  blaque: lol but i like sushi  that area is my fav place to fish on the whole lake. there is a drop from 5 to 16 feet, followed by a hump, and access to even deeper water. perfect place for walleye and bass."
480836,bare foot wader,2010-06-29 17:02:00,1354, take that massive snap swivel off that crankbait!!!!
480838,BillsTheBassMan,2010-06-29 17:05:00,932," Yeah, that's a must Alex.  You're killing your own action and making it less attractive to the fish.  It's like wearing old track pants to a club."
480843,alexcba,2010-06-29 17:17:00,634,"it wasnt on there the entire day.. i had it on when i was chucking a spinner and went to do a quick swap.. it did cut the action down tho, not enough for the small mouth or the cat tho LOL!"
480846,canuckjack,2010-06-29 17:24:00,121,"Nice report, looks like a fun day for sure"
480862,bigbuck,2010-06-29 18:05:00,2449,Great report!! Nice tosee that there are still a few fish left in Rice.....LOL
480866,alexcba,2010-06-29 18:12:00,634," from what i've seen there are alot more people on rice tossing fish back rather than keeping them.. i just wish those butt heads that keep everything but the slot walleye would contribute.. when we hit the dock for lunch 3 guys had 2 stingers full of under and over slot fish.. bah! i even told them that there was a slot and they said ""ya, i know.. you a CO?"" lol shoulda said yes."
480877,ctranter,2010-06-29 18:46:00,543,"I fell in love with live target cranks this opener as well, love the attention to detail and the action is just insane.  I am still undecided about the live target crawfish cranks, they look nice but I haven't tested one yet - anyone with experience with these?  Thanks for the report!"
480883,alexcba,2010-06-29 19:02:00,634,"i picked up a few the other day. will let you know how they do after im done using them this weekend. i imagine casting them into a rocky shoreline or a dock would work pretty good, with just deflections alone."
