I was thinking of trying Walmart or CT.What is the price these days of a new filled tank? Is there anywhere else with a better deal? thanks"
478897,Dondorfish,2010-06-24 04:07:00,1000,"Try Costco - my buddy bought one a couple a weeks ago, and found Costco had the best price around.  Don"
478898,GBW,2010-06-24 04:08:00,8460,"do the trade in on your old tank(s) and get a full ""new to you"" tank for under $50.00 at the local gas station."
478924,danbouck,2010-06-24 10:55:00,4380,$39.99 at Canadian tire
478925,Billy Bob,2010-06-24 11:03:00,5865,"I got rid of the ""pro-pain"" tank for natural gas years ago when LP went up to $10 and now it's $20....however, at the Res it's still about $10."
478927,Fisherman,2010-06-24 11:12:00,7201,Costco without a doubt.
478937,Burtess,2010-06-24 11:34:00,901,Another vote for Costco.  I just bought my dad a new tank the other week..... $26.99 plus $10.99 to fill.  At Crappy Tire you pay $39.99 plus somewhere around $14-15 to fill.  Good savings at Costco for sure!  Burt

480657,skeeter,2010-06-29 03:22:00,1907,"yes costco is the cheapest by far, and there tanks are already purged so that saves you a few bucks as well.  if the tank has expired then they will not exchange it for you.  sorry for the late reply but i have been up at the trailer most of the time so i just got back today. and im heading back up again on wednesday."
