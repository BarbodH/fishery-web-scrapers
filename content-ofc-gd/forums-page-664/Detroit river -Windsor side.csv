479829,splashhopper,2010-06-27 02:18:00,2931,"A friend of mine and I are driving three ppl to the Detroit airport. I don;t have a passport and will wait on the Canadian side for my buddy to get back in to Canada.  On Friday when we picked our guests up, I did the same thing and dmmit of they weren't held up by the CANADIAN border guards and thoroughly checked out. ( especially my Canadian buddy) Needless to say, I sat at the McDonalds for 3 hours waiting for them... wishing I had my fishing gear with me.  So, tomorrow, I am bringing a rod and my tackle bag.  Gonna sit on the bank near the bridge behind the University.  I have no clue what the water is like, other than it looks pretty damned fast.  I was thinking of putting a real heavy bell sinker on and set a drop shot rig up. Rig it with some soft plastic pink worms and see what may take it. Was also thinking about tossing some heavy jigs etc.  If anyone has fished this area at all and have any suggestions, I am all ears to kill an anticipated 2 hours or so. Or maybe I will just have a nice nap in the grass along the river..  Thanks for any help at this last hour.  Splashhopper"

480020,Twocoda,2010-06-27 18:29:00,4130,Think like a pickerel....Erie Dearies with a ( real) worm trailer...orange or chartreuse (CT or Wallymart)...Hotshot the current they will hit on the descent  Good Luck...let me know how ya make out
480060,splashhopper,2010-06-27 21:45:00,2931," Well I didn't have any luck whatsoever. But then again, I have never fished a river that was as fast as the St Clair  Dam, I didn;t have anything with enough weight to get my senko's to the bottom of that speedway.  I did see one helluva lot of boat traffic though and one super noisy cigarette boat  Heck, I even tried fishing an area where I saw the ducks ""drifting "" up-river. I could get my bait down to the bottom there and had a couple of hits, or maybe they were just rocks  After about 90 minutes of that, I walked up to the french fry truck and got some poutine. (tasted like rubberized cheese on frozen fries btw) Also took a walk over to the local fishing club to see what kind of fish they were feeding. (One helluva lot of rainbows in that tank)  Decided to walk down river towards the marina behind the casino.  Walked thru the parking lot up to an ol boy that was working on his old wooden cruiser on the docks. I asked him if it was ok to fish the marina. His reply: "" you're not supposed to, but have at it son, everybody else does"".  I fished the weed edges off the ends of empty docks for about 30 minutes when my buddy calls and says he cleared Canadian customs  Next time I am down there, I think I will launch my canoe and fish the hell outa that area. The water was clear( 8-10 ft) but I could see dark things moving towards my senko's there.  All in all, it beat the heck outa sitting in a park and listening to the punks with their ""boom boom cars"" driving by.  No worries though, my buddy Dutchy filled me in on his adventures for the opener and he was slaying em  I had a great weekend with some friends from Texas and will be out after those bass every chance I can get this week for sunset."

480390,mpt,2010-06-28 16:57:00,158,There is fishing south of Windsor also. LaSalle has a fishing pier and Amherstburg used to have a fishing dock. The Amherstberg channel is producing some nice walleye/pikerel.
480529,splashhopper,2010-06-28 22:31:00,2931, That would have been one helluva walk
480539,scugpg,2010-06-28 22:53:00,1373,I hope you turned your lights off while you were fishing!
480826,mpt,2010-06-29 16:46:00,158,  Is your buddy not allowed to drive south of Windsor?
480865,splashhopper,2010-06-29 18:06:00,2931," No, I was the one without the passport   so I had to stay behind...  Oh well, I will have one soon."
