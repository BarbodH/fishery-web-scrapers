480436,Tdel,2010-06-28 19:28:00,393,Lots of rain and gusting winds here in Penetang.  3 or 4 hydro trucks sitting on the back road between Penetang and Midland waiting to see what happens I guess.  Lots of water on the roads.  Storm blew through the area just as fast as it came in.  I was driving from Midland to Penetang and at times the rain was coming down with gusting winds so heavy I couldn't see the road.  Tom
