No luck yet getting that first 'ski, but, have caught walters everytime out. Weedbeds, weedbeds, weedbeds in about 5 to 8 feet of water. Couple of pics...      Lots of crappie, perch and a few OOS bass (quickly released) as well."

477845,asdve23rveavwa,2010-06-21 20:52:00,2690,"Thanks, guys, nothing big (three in the slot ranging from 14 1/2""-16"") one just under.  Kept two of the in slots, along with a couple of crappie and one large perch for supper last night.  What a great father's day feed!!!"

478131,Guest Johnny Bass,2010-06-22 14:14:00,0,Great Report. Certainly looks like perfect pickerel weather. Thanks for sharing.
480917,KawarthaGuy,2010-06-29 20:21:00,46,"Frankie65,  I noticed in your last photo there is what appears to be a free launch in the background.  Can you share where that is on Scugog.  PM if you prefer.  Thanks.  KawarthaGuy  "
480919,fish-miester,2010-06-29 20:24:00,864,"Kawartha Guy, PM me I'll give you a list of free Launches on Scugog.. but I wont tell you wich one he is fishing infront of unless I have his permission"
480922,Jet,2010-06-29 20:34:00,364,Great stuff Frankie!
480923,asdve23rveavwa,2010-06-29 20:35:00,2690,"Thanks, fish-meister.  Go ahead and tell him in a PM.  I debated blanking out the background, but, after thinking about it said what the heck.  All I ask from people that fish there is don't abuse it.  I have a self imposed limit of two walleye, plus the slot is in effect.  There are plenty of crappie, perch and sunfish for a great fish feed!!"
480927,fish-miester,2010-06-29 20:42:00,864," ya not only walleye, crappie and pan fish I have caught plenty of musky and other fish there too! but I am not one to give away peoples spots, I have PM'd him with a list of 10 or so free launches around lake Scugog, If he is still interested in that same location with your permission I will tell him."
