It sure beats a canoe. I've done a lot of walleye and pike fishing, and with bass just recently opening, I plan on hitting them often as well. Since there are already a lot of opening bass reports, I'd though I'd share an outing I had with my brother.  He had never caught a pike, so I brought him to a sure bet spot where I knew there were plenty. They were not monsters by any means, but still fun to fish. I rigged us up with what I knew worked best and with the first cast, we had a fish on. We must have pulled in 12-15 pike with the average being around 22"". The largest of the day was 29"". Earlier in the day they all seemed to be buried in the thick lily pads, so all used used were spinner baits. Then later in the after noon we decided to relax and troll some shorelines, and I think we did even better. Again all on spinner baits. Enjoy the pics!        ...that's not a vertical hold, the picture is just sideways...   "
