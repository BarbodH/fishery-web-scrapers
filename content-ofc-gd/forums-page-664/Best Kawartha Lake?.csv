479581,a.cortellessa,2010-06-26 02:02:00,142,"Hey everyone, I was just looking to see everyone's opinion on what they thought was the best Kawartha lake for fishing bass and muskie?  PS. How does head lake compare?  Thanks"
479600,Dutch,2010-06-26 03:15:00,831,I vote pigeon - mostly the South end.
479618,a.cortellessa,2010-06-26 03:48:00,142,thanks for the vote!
479629,Sinker,2010-06-26 04:22:00,8692,"They're all good, you just have to pick one and fish it.  S."
479641,archer379,2010-06-26 09:42:00,277,i vote for pigeon as well will be out there in about a hour
479649,canadadude,2010-06-26 12:26:00,769,pigeon
479662,Big Cliff,2010-06-26 14:35:00,6899,Anything but Sturgeon!
479665,Roy,2010-06-26 14:38:00,13728," Yeah, NO fish in Sturgeon eh Cliff?"
479746,Garnet,2010-06-26 21:39:00,2056,Well you didn't listen the last time Cliff. Get those rods strip of line put them in the shower with dish soap then rinse. Now put all new line on and new baits and get back to catching fish.
479911,Garry2Rs,2010-06-27 11:58:00,1425,"Asking which is the best Kawartha Lake is like asking which is the best Car, Truck or Hockey team."
479967,ehg,2010-06-27 15:30:00,2666,North part of Pigeon has tons of musky and bass. I like it best.
480021,Twocoda,2010-06-27 18:33:00,4130,i would think the best one would be the one you own property on...
480234,a.cortellessa,2010-06-28 02:33:00,142,Seems like everyone is a big fan of pigeon! thanks for the help gentlemen.  
480496,Garry2Rs,2010-06-28 21:29:00,1425,"The Tri-Lakes, Pigeon/the Bald's/Upper Buckhorn and Chemong are a great pieces of water.  The big plus is that you can boat from one to the other without going through a Locke.  The downside is there is a Bass tournament every weekend!  Being big means big fish, but it also means that there is also a lot of dead water to eliminate, before you can score consistently.  For those who know there way around, that's fine.  For beginners...Let's just say that unless you hire a guide, you can count on spending a lot of time exploring. Garry2R's"
480505,camillj,2010-06-28 21:37:00,1988,Sturgeon ... last time I was there I scored a sweet 9.9hp Johnson Seahorse motor and lost a 50+ musky ... and shared a beer with Big Cliff on his dock ... now thats a triple header ...
480593,skeeter,2010-06-29 01:24:00,1907,"any time your with cliff , is a good time."
480601,Harrison,2010-06-29 01:39:00,2202,"Just throw a dart, they all have their own special traits whether it be species and/or structure."
480604,cowanjo,2010-06-29 01:47:00,249,"I am biased and blessed to be on Little bald lake which I think is best. The Bald lakes get less traffic, the fishing is sometimes tough (Especially if you were with me last weekend ... where did those musky go?)  good Luck - everyone here help me learn to fish in canada so enjoy."
480630,Paully,2010-06-29 02:26:00,712,I like the smaller lakes ..    less people means more fish for me..lol
