Started fishing frogs in the early morning and I managed a few 1.5lbr's. Rick got a few over 2lbs witch was nice to see  Here are a few from the start of the trip(GoneFishin)       A few of those fish were jig fish too. after 10ish I locked in on spinnerbait fish catching so many of them...we must of caught about 50 fish from 5-1pm...it was a good day considering the downpour we had all afternoon haha.  Here are some more pictures with some biggins!        Hope you enjoyed I sure did. Was awesome out there...wish we didnt melt from the rain haha  Thanks for reading, MTBF  "

479763,Bernie66,2010-06-26 22:46:00,123,Nice fish guys.  Where do you launch to get into Seymore?  The only place I know of is downstream from Hastings.  Any help would be appreciated.  Thanx

479842,Garry2Rs,2010-06-27 02:37:00,1425,Nice going you-guys!
479844,Garry2Rs,2010-06-27 02:45:00,1425, Heading East on Hwy#7 Turn south on CR#30 at Havelock.  Follow this road to the bridge over the Trent river. The launch is beside the bridge on the East side. Motor down stream...East...into Seymour Lake. Watch your speed going down stream there's a big 10K zone. Garry2R's
