If anyone with experience on the lake would care to help us out with any information, general areas, or even spots, we would sure appreciate it.  We are used to fishing the trilakes but want to try some new waters this year.  And we live release all bass caught.  Many thanks for any help anyone can provide."

Many 5lb plus catches. If you have a chance, there a small lake off WLK at the north east end. Very narrow pass but if you tip your motor up all the way you can make it. On the left is deep water and in oon the right is stumps. Have great success. Hope this info is still valid. It was 20 years ago but I remember it well."

The lakes got a big cliff to jump from (just ask the dude at tanglewood where it is) but be careful, a guy died there a few years ago. Lots of smallmouth from my experience. Post some pics.. I haven't been there in a while."
