480572,LegitFish,2010-06-29 00:40:00,69,Anyone wear fishing gloves during the summer? If so any recommendations?
480573,jediangler,2010-06-29 00:43:00,1923,I wear cycling gloves when I am kayakfishing. The padding in the palms and cloth over the thumbs keeps you from getting blisters.
480575,JohnF,2010-06-29 00:45:00,3494,Golf gloves. They're made to get soaked.  JF

480603,bare foot wader,2010-06-29 01:46:00,1354,lots out there similar to this one....popular with saltwater fly anglers...UV protection and to protect the fingers from getting burnt on a big run....  http://www.basspro.com/webapp/wcs/stores/servlet/Product_10151_-1_10001_15183_151006001_151000000_151006000_151-6-1
480608,alexcba,2010-06-29 01:55:00,634,"i dont really like using them, your skin wont take as much protective slime off the fish as a glove would, since most of my fishing is C&R i just use my hands. got tons of scars to prove it too  lol"

481001,leighfns,2010-06-29 23:57:00,103,I don't wear any.. and like the others who don't my hands have many scars to show
481034,mbac31,2010-06-30 01:31:00,904,"I wear them but take them off to handle the bigger fish if needed. I wear the Sun Shade neck scarf as well. I have been wearing them for over 6 years now, my skin is white but I should not have a problem with skin cancer  at least.  I'm not a wuss either. I have lost 7 people in my family to cancer one was 18 years old, and would rather grow up to watch my children marry. Very cheap insurance if you ask me. They work very well and keep you cool under the hottest of conditions. I have just decided not to wear to much sun screen."
