I'm going to go up in strength to 80 or 100 pound. For those of you who use this heavier floro, do you attach to your fly/lure with a knot, or do you use sleeves and crimp them? If you use a knot, do you have any preferred one?  Thanks"

On the Seaguar site I found a loop knot that works.  It's the old Homer Rhodes, but it does the trick.  Seaguar also suggests that you use a little Chap-Stick to lubricate the line as you draw it tight.  I found this a big help in getting a small knot. http://www.seaguar.com/seaguar-community/loop-knot.htm"
