480477,Radnine,2010-06-28 20:50:00,1538," Dan, by the looks of the pictures I have seen, if you threw everybody in the lake that was smoking the water level would be back to normal. Welcome to you Young Fisher! I am glad to hear that you had an opportunity at a young age to see the best that fishing has to offer:camaraderie, mentoring, fun, and good food! Enjoy this site and enjoy your fishing!! Jim PS Gerritt is a good man, perhaps the two of you can stop smoking together"
