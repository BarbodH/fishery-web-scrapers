479408,Roy,2010-06-25 14:55:00,13728,"Agreed, John.  Again, here is the text of both warranty types as spelled out on Shimano's site. Sounds quite clear to me.  Shimano Rod - Limited Lifetime Warranty As used herein, “Shimano” will mean “Shimano American Corporation” with respect to United States warranty claims and “Shimano Canada Ltd. / LTÉE” with respect to Canadian warranty claims. Shimano and Shimano Canada Ltd. / LTÉE warrant to the original retail purchaser that this rod will be free from non-conformities in materials and workmanship. Shimano's sole obligation under this Limited Lifetime Warranty is to repair or replace, at Shimano's option, a non-conforming rod at no cost to the original retail purchaser other than the cost of packing, insuring, and shipping the rod to Shimano. This Limited Lifetime Warranty will be considered VOID if the rod is found to have been subjected to repairs not authorized by Shimano, or if it has been modified, neglected, improperly maintained, misused, abused, or the appearance of the product reveals damage by your failure to provide proper maintenance.  To request warranty repairs on a United States warranty claim, send your rod, postage prepaid, to Shimano or return it to the retailer that it was purchased from. To request warranty repairs on a Canadian warranty claim, send your rod, postage prepaid to Shimano Canada Ltd. / LTÉE or return it to an Authorized Canadian Warranty Center. All warranty requests must be accompanied by a valid dated sales receipt and a brief note describing the difficulty you are experiencing with the rod in as much detail as possible.  Rods that are repaired or replaced by Shimano or Shimano Canada Ltd. / LTÉE under the terms of this Limited Lifetime Warranty will be shipped back to you with Shimano or Shimano Canada Ltd. / LTÉE paying the return shipping charges. If your rod should be found to require repairs outside of the coverage provided by this Limited Lifetime Warranty, Shimano or Shimano Canada Ltd. / LTÉE will perform the repair or replacement and bill you for parts, labor, and return shipping charges. Retailer and wholesaler outlets are not required to perform warranty repairs or exchanges on behalf of Shimano or Shimano Canada Ltd. / LTÉE, nor are they authorized to modify this warranty in any way.  THIS LIMITED LIFETIME WARRANTY DOES NOT EXTEND TO OR COVER ANY DAMAGE TO THE ROD NOT RESULTING FROM A NON-CONFORMITY IN MATERIAL OR WORKMANSHIP; ANY DAMAGE CAUSED BY MISUSE, ABUSE OR TAMPERING WITH THE ROD BY OTHER THAN NORMAL USE OF THE ROD; OR ANY NON-CONFORMITY OR DAMAGE RESULTING FROM REPAIRS PERFORMED OTHER THAN BY SHIMANO OR AN AUTHORIZED SHIMANO SERVICE PROVIDER.  Shimano Rod - One Year Warranty As used herein, “Shimano” will mean “Shimano American Corporation” with respect to United States warranty claims and “Shimano Canada Ltd. / LTÉE” with respect to Canadian warranty claims.

479411,jedimaster,2010-06-25 15:10:00,3472,"I called, Shimano in Irvine, They said unconditionally Vrods are still warranted and he gave me the number to call in canada. In fact he also said my clarus with lifted guides is also covered and should be replaced. I called the canadian number and they said the Clarus was only 70 dollars and as such its not covered for anything other than breakage after a few uses. They also said Vrods also have no more warranty on them. I called back the irvine office they said no that is not right vrods are covered for life to the original owner. The clarus I have is also covered for life the price of the rods means nothing. Its backed by the limited lifetime warranty and its covered too. He is going to investigate directly with the canadian office and see what is going on. He was very surprised when I explained to him the situation and was noticibly pissed off. He said without a doubt if I brought it in to a US repair center they would replace them both over the counter. He said the limitations are limitations to the cause of the damage not to the length of term of the warranty."
479420,Duckie,2010-06-25 15:34:00,305,"I think part of the problem is that even though each manufacturer's warranty is stated, it is not always applied the same way.  for example, back when G. Loomis Canada had the Mount Hope plant, I had an IMX MBR783 baitcasting rod (a $300 rod at the time from LeBaron's) that had broken near the tip. I called them, arranged to bring it to them, and they had a brand new one there waiting for me for $60.  $60 for a new $300 rod. I was happy.  Now, here is the thing:  if you talk to other people who had had to use G. Loomis's warranty, they will tell you it sucks, was not honoured, they got shafted etc etc etc.  now, keep in mind that this rod had a true lifetime warranty, not a ""limited"" one.  still, you hear stories of people getting screwed.  I think that depending on which company rep you talk to, your experience can differ.  Probably the same with Shimano, St. Croix etc.  Personally, if I am going to spend $200+ on new rod, its going to be a Loomis or a St. Croix."
479423,jedimaster,2010-06-25 15:41:00,3472," I would agree but I held the Legend Tournament in my hand allongside with the gloomis and the cumara, and I liked the cumara better. I wish I didn't like it better, but what can i do. I guess I'll always be a shimano guy, i just wish I could get a straight answer from shimano. Even when I called shimano canada they were not able to give me any idea of when the cumara rods limited lifetime warranty will expire."
479424,bare foot wader,2010-06-25 15:55:00,1354,"my personal experiences from shimano canada in ptbo, ON is not good....highly rude and cuties on the phone...most recently they sent me a rebate cheque that was not signed and bank won't cash....good luck trying to get them to re-issue a new cheque....  best bet is having the irvine office make a few calls to shimano canada"
479460,Uncle Buck,2010-06-25 18:05:00,1000," $300 for a rod with a crappy grip... sorry warranty covers blank only...  looked like it had a set of channel locks taken to it along the whole grip... around it also...    not impressed... just bring it in, we replace it no questions asked sales pitch....  i brought it in... sorry blank only... plus need the reciept... then one guy says snap the tip off and we'll ""try"" and warranty that???  i didn't do it...  but awesome, i snap the tip on the rod, then he'd tell me, sorry warranty won't cover it..."
479464,lunkerbasshunter,2010-06-25 18:11:00,2585,limited lifetime is the key statement.  it is not the same as lifetime at all.  thats the way retail works.
479485,canadadude,2010-06-25 18:34:00,769,"Loomis warranty now is called the expediter warranty, you pay $75.00 and they replace the rod no questions asked."
479489,Duckie,2010-06-25 19:07:00,305,"there is a lot of debate about the warranties on expensive rods and whether or not that coverage should be included in the price.  some say, drop the price by $100, and if I break it or have an accident I pay full price for a new one.  others say keep the price elevated, and if I have an accident with the rod, let me pay 75 dollars or whatever for a new one.  personally, when I buy an expensive rod (not very often lol) I buy it for the characteristics of the rod, not the warranty.  the high end Loomis's and St. Croix that I have fished with have been a joy to fish with. light, well balanced (you can fish all day and not have a sore arm), sensitive, cast a quarter mile and have the power to get a great hookset, yet are not too stiff.  the fact that they may also have a lifetime warranty is just gravy IMO.  the thing is, crap happens. I have never broken a rod while fishing (<touches wood>) but have had a rod break to a slammed car door once.  you can be extra careful with your equipment and sometimes, well, crap happens.  so sometimes having a good warranty is a very good thing. but there are some who would rather not pay for this cost included upfront in a new rod.  the debate will never end.."
479497,canadadude,2010-06-25 19:27:00,769,"I've been looking into Northfork blanks which is Garry Loomis's new company and the blanks alone cost the same as high end Loomis rod.They look pretty sweet and I know with Garry designing them they'll be top notch.The last info I got is there still working on a 13'6"" center pin blank which should be on the market soon"
479498,Terry,2010-06-25 19:43:00,14456,"hope they cover it  I think most times it is the salesman fault and ours of believing them  I have had more deals fall through because while the bill or contract or offer was being written up a write in it things that the salesman has guaranteed something  then they say you cant put that in the contract... I say.but you told me that word for word, are you telling me you lied then they seem to get real mad..I guess because I remembered what they promised me...most salemen will say anything to close a deal............period"
479500,TennesseeGuy,2010-06-25 19:50:00,957,Beware of the salesman who honors a lifetime warranty by shortening the life of a customer.
479502,JohnF,2010-06-25 19:55:00,3494," Great point. Not to derail this thread but in answer to the salesman's argument that you can't put a promise in a contract, the Ont govt has now written it into law that real estate salespersons must put promises in writing. Maybe we need more sales type jobs to be under license. Might bring a halt to a lot of this misrepresentation that goes on.  JF"
479577,aplumma,2010-06-26 01:40:00,6896,while I am not a lawyer but I do play one on T.V. disclaimer.  A verbal contract or statement can not override a written contract or statement. Salesman will as others said promise the world but only need to deliver the contract.   Art
479595,ld17,2010-06-26 03:01:00,319,"I've read all the posts and what you guys need to do is develop a good relationship with a tackle store.  I buy and send lots of customers to the store.  Then my friend gives me a rod and reel that he doesn't want.  In the process of giving me the rod he breaks the tip bringing it into my house. So I go to my local shop and say can you fix my rod with the broken tip, they say sure bring it in.  So I do and then they say why don't we send it in under warranty claim and I'll just give you a new one.  I'm like you can do that.  Yes they say and I get a new rod that's in stock at the store.  No problems no worries.  Now all that to get my point out.  If you take care of your local shop they will take care of you.  I didn't even buy the rod there and who knows how old it was but they took care of me.  That what you should be doing and you never have to worry about a warranty."
479648,canadadude,2010-06-26 12:21:00,769,"I agree it use to be like this with alot of local shops,unfortunatly manufacturers are alot more stringent on warranty issues in todays economy.Gone are the days when my local shop will replace my rod with one off the shelf because the manufacturer won't replace the rod he sends in for warranty.It's tough for the local shops to take a hit."
479651,lew,2010-06-26 12:37:00,12766,I bent a guide & broke the insert on one of my Compre musky rods 2 weeks ago. Dropped it off at the P'Boro Shimano office and picked it up the next morning all fixed up and  got a repair bill for $5.00  I was happy with that.
480831,jedimaster,2010-06-29 16:56:00,3472,"I got a call back while I was on my way up to a tourney this weekend from one of the VP's at the Irvine office. He was flabergasted by what was going on out of the Canada office. He said unquestionably Vrods are still covered and if they break they wil be replaced with a cruicial. He said that the limited in limited lifetime warranty refers to the type of damage not the length of time the rod is warranted for. Also he said that Guides, finish and grip are all covered under the warranty. If I send them back to the US or bring them to a US repair center they will be replaced. He tried to get a hold of someone from the Canada side but they were already closed. He said that he will follow up with me this week when he is able to find out what is going on north of the border."
480833,bare foot wader,2010-06-29 16:59:00,1354,good on ya for fighting it out...hope you enjoy your new crucial
480933,BillM,2010-06-29 20:54:00,17367," lol, $5.00.  That's awesome lew."
480941,lew,2010-06-29 21:28:00,12766," Yeah, it was Bill.  Almost like they couldn't fix it under warranty as I broke it thru my own stupidity but they had to charge me something, so it's like OK...gimme 5 bucks"
480958,Dr. Hook,2010-06-29 22:15:00,18," Looks like you are getting to the bottom of things here, that is good. I've been doing some research and trying to decide who has the best warranty. It seems that there is a discrepency between the Canadian Shimano and Shimano down in the US. Your experience is a far cry from some of the stories I have read on American forums, things like, ""my idiot buddy slammed my 8 year old rod in the door, but they gave me a brand new one no questions asked, right over the counter at my tackle store"" This is no suprise as customer service is typically more of a priority down there. What I get from all of this is that it would be best to deal directly with the Americans for warranty claims.  Unfortunately that probably means shipping a rod south, unlesss its possible to get to one of those US repair centers. Do you know if there are any located in the Buffalo area?  I just picked up a shimano voltaeus rod (to get me by until more $$). $60 CAD, limited lifetime warranty, I figured why not. Any problems and I will go south.  Good luck with this, hopefully the Irvine office will talk some sense into their Canadian arm. Keep us posted on how things go."
480962,Roy,2010-06-29 22:30:00,13728," Lew, it might just be good karma coming back at you from Shimano. If they only knew how many people you've converted to their products. Not that you've ever pushed their wares...you simply mention them in a positive way if you were satisfied with them.. I have 5 Compre rods and I remember that the very first one I bought was on your recommendation. A few other items you have recommended I have purchased and I have always been happy with the results. You only reap what you sow. This little blurb should get you your $5. back.  Thanks Bud."
481021,jedimaster,2010-06-30 00:36:00,3472,"I'll make sure to post back when I hear back from Irvine or from Canada. Like I said from the begining I am not trying to slam shimano, I just want a clear explaination as to what the story is on the warranty, not only for us Vrod owners but for anyone buying a Shimano rod expecting a lifetime of limited lifetime warranty. I still love shimano rods and reels, but I just want to know. I just wish shimano hats were nicer looking then I could put my Gloomis and St.Croix hats on the wall.   "
481031,vinnimon,2010-06-30 01:15:00,2593,"Jedimaster do what I did!Send it  in a cardboard shipping tube very well marked,VERY VERY WELL MARKED,FRAGILE.Through canada post.Insure for twice the cost of the rod and all fees.If the tube comes back damaged.In that shimano says it was and they cant warranty it due to damages.You got your self a legit claim.I usually deal with the shops but the first time I ventured that route.SHOOT I POSTED IT!OH WELL!"
479111,jedimaster,2010-06-24 18:13:00,3472,"Well I have been a long time Shimano purchaser, in fact I just bought a new cumara yesterday to add to my other dozen shimano rods, not to mention the doze or so shimano reels. I am now very dismayed with shimano. I heard from a fellow angler that someone was refused warranty replacement on a Vrod due to the age. Now we all know Shimano has an excellent history of replacing broken rods. My initial reaction was ""No WAY, Shimano wouldn't do that"" I mean I have had rods and even a Vrod replaced. I sent an email to Shimano and in fact the reply I got implied that Vrods are too old. to be covered by the Limited Lifetime warranty. This is not a good situation as far as I am concerned.  Here is the unedited email response I got back from Shimano with regards to the Vrods.  V-Rods featured a LIMITED lifetime warranty and have been discontinued for almost 7 years now. If a fishing rod has a product defect it will generally show up in its first initial stages of use. Through several years of usage, fishing rods are like anything else as they also go through stages of regular wear and tear. LIMITED lifetime warranty and LIFETIME warranty are not the same. If the rods are broken near the very top they may be able to be repaired depending upon where the break is situated on the blank section. With Kind Regards     To me this sounds as though they will no longer be replaced, and if the break near the tip they may be repaired, otherwise we are out of luck. I have sent a reply back and I will follow that up on here.  Now we all know that Shimano puts allot of money and work into fishing and conservation, and that yes a Vrod is now a very old rod, however a lifetime warranty limited or or not should last a lifetime under the conditions of the limitations."
479120,aplumma,2010-06-24 18:47:00,6896,I hate to say it but LIMITED lifetime warranty... key word limited is a legal definition that is exactly what they are fulfilling. They are also correct that if a blank is defective then it will pop sooner than 7 years at that age the breaks are due to use and abuse not a defective rod. Even without the word limited if they enforced the defect rule stringently a 7 year old rod would rarely be a true warranty issue. Most of them if replaced are as a good faith replacement to keep the squeeky wheels happy and not bashing the products. If to many rods are replaced as a warranty rightfully or not then it is an overhead issue that will cause the rods price to go higher. It's a tight rope walk for sure keeping both the purchasers of new and the faithful of old both happy with service and price.  Art
479140,jedimaster,2010-06-24 19:21:00,3472,Its just important for current and new customers to understand a few things 1) Vrods are no longer being replaced under the warranty. 2) The Limited Lifetime warranty does not last a lifetime. It is limited to some number of years determined by Shimano. 
479170,ecmilley,2010-06-24 20:26:00,2163,"as I understand it, it's a warranty against defects and it is very unlikley a rod would fail after 7 or 8 years if wasn't dinged by a weight or something to that effect, i 've had many rods fail that were defective and they failed in the first or second outing. Still v-rods are great rods but i can see where shimano is coming from and i wouldn't be happy if i was stuck with one that just up and broke"
479186,ohhenrygsr,2010-06-24 21:22:00,947,In the end you did get your monies worth out of the rod and it provided endless memories.
479191,jedimaster,2010-06-24 21:47:00,3472,"Like I said the point is not how much money or use you got out of it. The point is if it says lifetime, that generally means lifetime, not until you get your use out of it. What if I fish 3 times per year? Then in 7 years that 21 outings. Is that sufficient use to have a lifetime warranty pulled on a product? What if I fished twice per week then sufficient use would be what 2 months warranty? I have had a few rods break on the first hook set, I have also had a few rods break after several years of use. If there is a time limitation on the use of a rod before it is no longer covered under warranty then the company should put a time limit on it. I doubt you guys would be too happy if you took your tranny in with 6 months to spare on the warranty and 50k left on its warranty and they said to you well you clearly got your use out of it.  What about a tool that has a lifetime warranty? Are you going to not expect a new ratchet that you bought with a lifetime warranty if it breaks in 5 year or 10 years? Doesn't change the fact that shimano puts out great products, just that the warranty is not lifetime as shimano has lead us all to believe thats all. At least offer to replace them with a fee or something like some other rod makers do or offer a rebate on a new rod of equal or lesser value."
479192,Duckie,2010-06-24 21:48:00,305,"thats disappointing.  the fact that they do not make the rod anymore is meaningless as most companies will use the equivelent price point rod in their lineup (in this case, the Crucial) as a suitable replacement.  my Sage fly rod is in washington right now under warranty work thanks to a car door  . the bottom butt section broke and they are custom building me a new bottom section, and this rod they don't make anymore either. but they are going to make one for a small charge  which is significantly less than the price of a brand new Sage rod.. thats what a lifetime warranty should be..  IMO, they should have been able to do more for you. the V-rods were not cheap when they first came out. they were an expensive rod and part of that initial cost was the great warranty.  it sucks that they go back on their word. what are they? politicians?"
479194,jedimaster,2010-06-24 21:53:00,3472,"Thats exactly what I mean, offer up something. A coupon or something.  Some companies have a disclaimer that when a product is discontinued the lifetime warranty is nullified after X number of years. The shimano warranty makes no such references. Oh well, live and learn. I can see alot of Crucials and compres breaking by accident when the crucial and compre line get discontinued."
479198,Duckie,2010-06-24 22:06:00,305,"I don't think you should give up easily.  go over to Tackletour.com, register on the forum and post a message on the Shimano product support forum. there is a Shimano Rep that posts daily (user named Bantam1) that may be able to help you.  if that doesn't work, see if you can contact a supervisor and explain your situation. a lifetime warranty on an expensive rod should carry more weight than this.  there is no reason why they can't use a current equivelent priced rod and go from there."
479217,canadadude,2010-06-24 22:45:00,769,"It's not a lifetime warranty,it's a LIMITED lifetime warranty on manufacturer defects which does not include smashing it in a car door, steping on it,smashing it off the side of a boat... ect.Manufacturer defects will show the first or second time using the product not 7yrs later. Why can't you understand the difference? I'm sure if you could prove to Shimano you had a brand new v-rod that was 7 yrs old and broke do to manufacturer defect that they would honor the warranty.The thing is you need to learn the difference between lifetime warranty and limited lifetime warranty."
479221,Duckie,2010-06-24 23:02:00,305,^ correct. and I stand corrected as I was posting as if the rod had a true lifetime warranty (eg. the sage rod I mentioned) vs a limited lifetime warranty that only covers manufacturer defects in the rod.  sorry for your rod breakage.
479223,jedimaster,2010-06-24 23:11:00,3472,"Limited lifetime warranty as stated in the shimano warranty does not indicate any such description of any term or number of uses before the rod breaks. This is the warranty as stated on the shimano website..  Shimano and Shimano Canada Ltd. / LTÉE warrant to the original retail purchaser that this rod will be free from non-conformities in materials and workmanship. Shimano's sole obligation under this Limited Lifetime Warranty is to repair or replace, at Shimano's option, a non-conforming rod at no cost to the original retail purchaser other than the cost of packing, insuring, and shipping the rod to Shimano. This Limited Lifetime Warranty will be considered VOID if the rod is found to have been subjected to repairs not authorized by Shimano, or if it has been modified, neglected, improperly maintained, misused, abused, or the appearance of the product reveals damage by your failure to provide proper maintenance.  You will notice the part in bold states nothing about the length of time I use the rod. These two rods look brand new not a nic on etither of them. They have not been repaired, they have not been modified, nor neglected, improperly maintained, misuused or abused. The only damage is where the rods are broken. So explain to me how in this limited lifetime warranty it states that if you have it for X number of years or use it X number of times, its warranty is now void?"
479226,canadadude,2010-06-24 23:30:00,769,Well dude fight with Shimano that after 7yrs of use the rods suddenly developed non-conformities in materials and workmanship because as it states thats all the warranty covers. Good luck with that
479227,jedimaster,2010-06-24 23:40:00,3472,So how many uses or how long does a limited lifetime warranty last then? 1 time on the lake? 1 year? 2 years? 5 years? 20 years? Do you not think it would be a good idea to define how long a limited lifetime warranty lasts for?
479242,canadadude,2010-06-25 00:29:00,769,"The lifetime warranty lasts for your life, however it's limited to non-comformities and workmanship which will show up the first few times in use.It's a marketing ploy, the manufacturer knows full well if there is a defect in the blank it's going to break with in the first few times of use.If there is a problem in workmaship ie: misaligned guides,poor finish, ect the purchaser will find this out quickly. Limited lifetime warranties only protect you from getting a product that should have probably been rejected at the factory.Loomis rods have the same Limited lifetime warranty, but they also have what is called an expediter warranty which is you pay $75.00 and they replace the rod no questions asked."
479338,irishfield,2010-06-25 05:44:00,26272,"I'm still using a Berkley Lightning spinning rod, that I bought in 1983, and a Lebaron Special bait caster rod(same darn thing in black wrap) that I bought at the same time. Both have a lifetime warrantee.. that I've yet to collect on in 27 years, and I sure don't have the receipt anymore! My most used rods.. What are you guys doing to yours???"
479343,GoneFishin,2010-06-25 07:36:00,349,"I agree with what you are saying. I buy shimano rods because I (know) I can replace it no matter what. After hearing this though I am a little disipointed. We spend the money because we know we are getting a quality product that will be In the line up for life, or atleast that's what I thought..."
479370,jedimaster,2010-06-25 12:29:00,3472," This is not the case at all. I bought two Clarus rods at the same time 4 years ago, both have seen equal treatment and use. One of them just this year the epoxy has started to peel off at all of the guides. I went to Aikmans with the one where the epoxy on the guides has started to come off and he said nothing he can do only the blank is guaranteed against breakage. When it breaks he will replace it, but the guides, finish misalignement etc are not covered. This warranty as we all know is against the rod from breaking.  Its not a money factor, as obviously if I am spending money on new Cumara rods I have money to spend. Its a principle of the fact that every one of us that has bought a shimano rod bought it knowing full well if it breaks we are gonna take it back and get a new one. Heck people even sell used shimano's with a disclamer saying if you break it you get a new one. It's just very disapointing. I tend to think when you put the word lifetime it means for life, weather or not the word limited is put in there with limitations on what has been limited int he warranty. Especially when the limitations do not state anything to do with the length or time it will be under warranty."

479374,canadadude,2010-06-25 12:48:00,769,"Dude you posted the warranty yourself, read it and try to understand it, if your under the impression that if you break it you automatically get it replaced your very wrong. The warranty dosn't state that at all or anything close to it, it's a limited warranty"
479382,Uncle Buck,2010-06-25 13:33:00,1000,"Warranty doesn't mean jack crap...  had a St. Croix avid float rod... ""lifetime warranty""  cork coming out of the handle all over the place... along the whole grip took it in, sorry, blank is covered not the cork... $300 rod What the hell???"
479391,bigbuck,2010-06-25 13:50:00,2449,ST. CROIX Avid and up!! I have not had a problem with St.Croix on warranty and have sent 3 rods back to them (I have 7or8) that have seen heavy use and got them back no problem.
479401,jedimaster,2010-06-25 14:13:00,3472,"Canadadude, I think you need to give your head a shake. Your telling me that the intention of the warranty is not to cover rod breakage? So have you never bought a shimano rod new from a store? The first thing out of every sales persons mouth is that if you break it they will replace it for life, Bass Pro, Lebaron, Gagnons, JB's, AV, Fishing world all say this during the sales pitch. Even if you talk to the shimano reps at the shows, or the repair centers, they all say if it breaks we replace it. Defects in quality, and workmanship are NOT covered. The only thing that is covered is if the rod actually breaks. As I said I took a rod in that had defects in the workmanship and they are NOT covered as the rod was not broken. The guy at Aikmans even said the guides, paint, finish handles are NOT covered for any reason. Only the blank is covered if the rod breaks. That is the limitation. The  limitation specifies nothing about a length of time the rod is covered. It only limits what parts of the rod are covered and under what circumstances the rod will not be covered as I posted. No mention of a time limitation or a number of casts limitation.  "
479403,JohnF,2010-06-25 14:32:00,3494,"Isn't the real problem here that warrantees are legal commitments, and as such are couched in all kinds of legalese that no one ever bothers to read. The sales clerk in the fishing rod store gets tired of mentioning all the disclaimers and qualifiers that are part of the legalese or he has learned that explaining the qualifiers detracts from the effectiveness of his sales pitch, so the sales pitch becomes ""and it's got a lifetime warranty"" which isn't exactly true. Then the buyer goes home thinking he's got a comprehensive warranty with no qualifiers or limitations (that are spelled out in the fine print on the tag we tear off and throw away) and in some cases even tries to resell the rod with the pitch that it's a ""lifetime warranty"" plain and simple.  When you think about it rationally why would a manufacturer of an item that retails for a few hundred bucks max after all the different levels of markup from manufacturer through distributer to retailer be stupid enough to offer an open-ended no questions asked warranty? This is a product that by the nature of it's intended use is going to be at least slightly abused, even unintentionally, like when you hook into an accidental 50"" muskie on an Ultralite rod. If the line doesn't break then probably the operator has used a line rated way above the rod's load limits.  Of course there are going to be qualifiers on any warranty offered. Any company that doesn't do that will probably not be in business long enough to honour warrantees on older rods.  Realistically shouldn't we be buying the rod for it's performance rather than how good the warranty is? After all, even a very expensive spinning rod is still only a few hundred bucks and as far as I'm concerned, if I'm going to hand over a few hundred bucks for a spinning rod I'm looking primarily for the performance and will not sacrifice any of that for a super warranty. And if I pay top buck for a ridiculous warranty at the expense of great performance I'm defeating the purpose of buying performance rods. If the very best performing rod happens to have a wonderful warranty then that's great. I can only hope the company knows what it's doing and will still be in business when I need more rods of the same calibre.  The key is to not just accept the sales clerks claims about warranty. Read the fine print. Ask what limited means. Don't expect something for nothing. Remember, if it sounds too good to be true, it's probably not true.  I don't think the disappointment should be with Shimano or whatever manufacturer is involved if the fine print said ""limited"". The disappointment is either with yourself for not reading the warranty terms or with the sales clerk who misrepresented the product warranty.  At the end of the day you have to ask yourself which is more important to you - the performance or the warranty claims. I'll take the best performance my pocketbook can afford. Any reputable manufacturer is going to have a reasonable warranty offer.  JF"

It's very clear, right from Shimanno I don't understand how you can't get it."
