Fairly new garage but still have a couple gas cans in the garage and worried the fumes will damage the baits or get impregnated in the plastics, scaring away fish when I use em?  Anyone store their plastics in the garage? Pictures of how you organize your tackle would be great  Thanks!"
480469,alexcba,2010-06-28 20:27:00,634,so long as the boxes are closed i dont think you'll have an issue. my best friend stores most of our stuff in his garage and its been good for years.. altho it also get used weekly..
480470,Uncle Buck,2010-06-28 20:28:00,1000,i'd be scared for security reasons... most garage doors have cheap locks on them... plus no alarm...
