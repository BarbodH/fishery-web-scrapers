480361,anders,2010-06-28 15:29:00,1168,Nice video...but where was this advice when Italy was playing..
480362,BillsTheBassMan,2010-06-28 15:36:00,932,"I was watching my Germans play vs feeble England   Time well spent.  Unfortunately, when we play Argentina next Saturday, I will be en route to Georgian Bay for a week of fishing . . . not a bad win-win situation to be in though!  Nice Video Limey!"
480377,asdve23rveavwa,2010-06-28 16:18:00,2690,"Have to give England some credit, for coming back from that 2-0 deficit (even though they didn't count the second goal).  The young German squad did outclass them for most of the game though. Bring on Argentina!!!  I'll be out fishing during that game as well...dvd recorder, and, hopefully I don't hear the score, LOL!!"
480392,Fish4Eyes,2010-06-28 16:58:00,1022,My favourite part of that game was how the ENGLISH commentators constantly kept mentioning how the 2nd England goal was not counted and then they stop mentioning it after Germany went up 3-1  .
480397,limeyangler,2010-06-28 17:08:00,5204,"  I thought it was just general knowledge    Thats gonna be an interesting match, i was very impressed by the Germans....although its easy to look good against England at the moment.    NO...we absolutely should not give England any credit...they were a steaming pile of dung from the beginning. What we need to give them is a pay cut...these bozzos on average earn over $150,000 A WEEK! not very good value for money. England have been out in the 1/4 finals before....but at least those times they played well and treated us to some good football in the group stages...this world cup was just embarrassing.  I wish that the disallowed goal incident never happened because now they have an excuse....when really there are no excuses left.   Anyhoo...good luck to Germany...they deserve to go all the way!"
480398,asdve23rveavwa,2010-06-28 17:10:00,2690,"LOL...I must say they do a great job of commentating, and, keep any bias they have at bay overall. Forgot to say in my first reply, nice vid...good mixed bag of fish!!!"
480399,bigugli,2010-06-28 17:13:00,6138,"A woefully onesided match.  Unfortunate that a team with such sub par performance like the English should make the 16, but the Ivory Coast, that played their hearts out, could not."
480402,BillsTheBassMan,2010-06-28 17:21:00,932,"Don't get me wrong - Argentina will be a world-class, most difficult opponent.  I think now that the Germans stand a good chance to beat them - they are more disciplined, more balanced, and extremely fit.  Argentina is great, but I feel they are riding a Maradonna-Induced high at the moment and with a manager with that much emotion, when things go well, they go great, and when things don't go so well, they unravel.  I'm hoping the Germans can grind them down and force the unraveling.  I put the match at 50/50.  We'll see - rather - we'll listen on the radio when we're Parry Sound Bound.  Does anyone know what stations carry World Cup games on the radio?"
480708,Guest Johnny Bass,2010-06-29 12:12:00,0,Another great vid! It sounds like you are really enjoying living in Northern Canada. Must be nice!  I gave up a soccer game to go fishing also!
480720,johnnyb,2010-06-29 12:31:00,3413,"Ahhhh I miss these reports    Been too long since I've had time to log in, but it's nice to see a Limey report right at the top of the page, as usual"
481022,limeyangler,2010-06-30 00:41:00,5204,  yup...living up here is definitely...i mean INFINITELY better than the England football 'team?'    dooood! where ya been? you out on parole ?
