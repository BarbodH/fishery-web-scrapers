480413,alexcba,2010-06-28 18:28:00,634,so im browsing the bass pro websites clearance items and i come across this... im not interested in buying it but i am however confused.. i thought using lights to attract fish was illegal?  http://www.basspro.com/webapp/wcs/stores/servlet/Product_10151_-1_10001_10205366____SearchResults
480415,Terry,2010-06-28 18:32:00,14456,they are legal in most states and I don't know if still but at one time was legal for smelt fishing with a net..can't remember if it's still legal in ontario
480417,bigfish1965,2010-06-28 18:38:00,3382,Attached to a net for smelt or as part of the lure still ok here..that item would be illegal here.
480418,Roy,2010-06-28 18:38:00,13728,Still legal for smelt here but that would be a poor choice for a smelt light.
480420,alexcba,2010-06-28 18:40:00,634,"ahh alright, just wanted to get that clarified. thanks all."
480423,bassmasta,2010-06-28 18:45:00,27, I remember fishing with my cousin last year and he used a lure with a built in light and he was catching smallies and walleye like crazy... it was pissing me off! called him CHEAP!
480624,OhioFisherman,2010-06-29 02:11:00,6623,"As a kid I remember fishing with dad and his friends on Lake Erie (Ohio side) completely legal here. Lights attracted Emerald shiners around the boat which in turn attracted white bass, by then the walleye and blue pike had vanished."
