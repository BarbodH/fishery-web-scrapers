480022,TC1OZ,2010-06-27 18:36:00,987,"Went out on the pond with Rob @ 6 AM. The weather looked like it could go either way with that red sky, but we were determined to ring in the opener either way. My 'new' trolling motor was running great and eventually got us into some fish.  The day started off slow; casting the shore with spinners while covering lots of area with the trolling motor. Rob was shocked as the normal hot spots weren't producing as normal. We tried anchoring out from a fallen tree and we switched it up to senkos and texas rigged worms. Nothing. But that didn't stop us. Back to covering ground hitting the shore with spinner baits. Rob was on fire pulling out a nice 4.2 Lbs large mouth.    I ended up going 6/8. 2 small mouth, 3 large mouth, and a big rock bass . I lost my biggest fish of the day early on, I wasn't keeping the line tight when the largies were jumping out of the water. Rob soon corrected me. He finished up the day 8/8. We were packed up and out of the water by noon. All and all it was a great opener. Anything beats working! Thanks again for the day out Rob.
