480365,youngfisher,2010-06-28 15:46:00,27,Could someone remind me of the lake Nippissing slot limit..?   Sam
480370,alexcba,2010-06-28 15:52:00,634,"i think nippising was 15.5"" to 23.5"" cant remember anymore.. maybe someone can back that up or correct me."
480371,youngfisher,2010-06-28 15:54:00,27,Ok thank you    Sam
480372,bigfish1965,2010-06-28 15:56:00,3382,"Make sure you get a copy of the regs Sam and keep them with you at all times. In the mean time, your answer can be found here http://www.mnr.gov.on.ca/en/Business/LetsFish/Publication/STEL02_163615.html  Do not take anyone's work for any law...always read it yourself. You can't use 'The guys on OFC said..' as a legal defense...lol."
480373,Jay T,2010-06-28 15:56:00,282, Imagine the concept of looking on the MNR website and reading the regulations all by yourself.  http://www.mnr.gov.on.ca/stdprodconsume/groups/lr/@mnr/@letsfish/documents/document/mnr_e001331.pdf
480374,youngfisher,2010-06-28 15:56:00,27,lol ok thank you very much   Sam
480385,Nipfisher,2010-06-28 16:46:00,2449,Nipissing slot size is 40cm-60cm have to go back in.
480459,Gerritt,2010-06-28 20:03:00,6129,"Thank you to everyone that has answered Sam and gave him the answer he was looking for. He is very excited to be part of OFC and is trying to become part of the community, guess that is why he did not ask me lol! But yes, Sam the slot for Nipissing is 40-60cm.  Hopefully everyone realizes that Sam is young and very eager to become apart of a greater fishing community. All he has talked about since we have returned from the G2G is all the new friends he has made, and cannot wait to see you all again and talk fishing. If I hear TJ's name one more time I am going to scream!!!  I hope we can keep the criticism of a young new member, that has not had the opportunity to go fishing in a very long time (as he had no one to take him) to a minimum. He needs guidance not criticism.  G."
