Being a HUGE Wayne Gretzky fan, she requests that he put Wayne's face on her right inner thigh.    After an hour of work, the artist finishes and shows the lady her work, ""This doesn't look anything like Gretzky,"" she says.    He takes out a picture of Wayne and compares them... ""See, they look just alike."" The lady does not agree. So, the artist agrees to do Wayne on the other thigh for free.    She comes back the next day to have her left thigh done. He does the tattoo and excitingly shows to her. ""This one doesn't look like Wayne Gretzky either!""    The artist insists that this one is identical to the picture of Wayne that she brought. To solve the debate, the artist calls his friend, a huge hockey fan, over to decide.    The friend comes over and the lady lifts her dress to show the tattoos. ""Hmmm, I'm not sure who the wingers are, but the center is definitely Lanny McDonald.""  "
