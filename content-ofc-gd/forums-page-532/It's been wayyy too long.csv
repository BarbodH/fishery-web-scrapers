585721,danc,2011-05-23 03:03:00,4677,"For the first time since I can remember, I never caught a Brook Trout last year. My job had taken over my life and never afforded me the time to get out fishing. In fact, last year was the first time I never went fishing on the May long weekend in about 40 years. Brook Trout fishing has always been a passion in my life, so this was a big deal to me. This weekend I got back on track. My good friend Colin and I spent Saturday chasing Brookies and Sunday on a Lake Superior trib after Steelhead. Both days were awesome.  My first Brook Trout in a year and a half was a nice one. A 21"" rather girthy male, with suprisingly nice colors for this time of year, was well worth waiting for. What a thrill it was to catch this guy.    And it was just as thrilling to watch him swim away.    Things slowed down for a couple of hours after that. Colin had a decent Brookie right up to the boat, but it spit the barbless hook at boatside. A couple of small Pike was all we had managed to catch for a while. I was beginning to think that it was going to be one of those days when the Brookies seem to completely disapear from the waters. Finally, this little guy gave us encouragement. It turned out to be our smallest Brook Trout of the weekend.    Soon after we moved to another area. Spiel might remember this place. We watched it burn from the boat a few years ago.    Today it was far from burning though. Quite the opposite in fact, as there was still a few pockets of ice around.    We went fishless for another half hour or so, until something amazing happened. Colin turned into a Brook Trout catching machine, landing 7 of them in about 45 minutes. I was delegated as net boy and camera guy. Here's what I got in that incredible time frame.                I took a few slow shutter speed shots just for fun and I really like how they came out.      Water temperature is the most important info that my fish finder gives me when fishing Brook Trout. We found temps from as low as 37F to as high as 52F. I was thrown off today though. I would have expeted to find them in the warmest water, but did best in the low 40'sF range. The 5' depth is common for us. 4 to 7 feet is about perfect.    After Colins marathon, I managed a few more as well.    It really was an awesome day!!  Today we hit a Superior trib for Steelhead. We got 5 I think. Nothing really big but it was fun.      Torpedo release of a little guy.    We kept one each for the barbeque.    This guy said good bye to us as we were leaving.    I hope you all enjoyed your weekend as well."
585724,splashhopper,2011-05-23 03:09:00,2931,wow.... great looking trout..... i had no idea that brook trout could get THAT big.... my buddy Dutchy has been holding out me thinks
585725,irishfield,2011-05-23 03:11:00,26272,What a great outing Dan. Glad to see that Jigfly hasn't lost it's charm! 
585737,Twocoda,2011-05-23 04:28:00,4130,Excellent report  ....appears the wait paid off....love the slow shutter speed shots too ...  Good on both of yas
585750,spincast,2011-05-23 10:13:00,3279,Love those colours - looks like a great outing. Thanks for the report.
585753,Roy,2011-05-23 10:27:00,13728,"What a great report, Dan. Glad you finally got back out. Such a great piece of water you have up there. I often wonder how many specs fall prey to the pike population in there. Try to get out there more.  Say hi to Colin...I feel like I know him from having seen him in so many past reports."
585754,Joey,2011-05-23 10:28:00,9122,"Great report Dan, so glad you got a chance to get out.  Love the slow shutter speed shots, and of course the eagle shot  Nice going!!!"
585763,Terry,2011-05-23 10:48:00,14456,glad you finally got out fishing  we here were all talking about taking your man card away from you...guess it's safe for now
585780,beginner,2011-05-23 11:34:00,542,great pics... looks like awesome day out.. like the shutter speed pic.. good capture..
585791,Guidofisherman,2011-05-23 12:16:00,206,"Great post. It is what I've been waiting for all winter. I know your passion. Catching Brookies like that is like great sex...dry spells followed by some action, then wondering what happened as your buddy gets lots (7), as you watch. Well, maybe that's a bit far to stretch the analogy. I'll bet Colin rubbed it in a bit that he got 7 in a row. Appreciated the photo work, especially the closeups and creative shutter speeds. I flew over the area last week and took some photos from the air (check PM) and noticed the water levels down about 3 ft. How were the reefs? Great to hear you are back in the game after last fall's disaster. Look forward to more reports and photos."
585792,misfish,2011-05-23 12:34:00,29133,Great photos Dan. Thanks for sharing your outting. Looks like you shed a few pounds. Working all the time will do that to ya.LOL
585793,Rod Caster,2011-05-23 12:39:00,5784,Trout heaven! I like the speed shots too
585796,mercman,2011-05-23 12:45:00,7054,"Hey Dan, what an awesome report.Those are some beautiful trout.The wait musta seemed eternal, but looks like you still ave the touch  Congrats  Paul"
585808,Ron,2011-05-23 13:14:00,1683,Glad to see there are still some fish to be found in your neck of the woods Dan. I heard the water levels are lower than last year. Another guy I know got out a week ago and did rather well.
585821,Joeytier,2011-05-23 14:15:00,3990,"Well, that's just not fair...  Just kidding.  Those are some incredible fish"
585861,corvette1,2011-05-23 17:05:00,1765,nice day on the water i liked the eagle picture
585866,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2011-05-23 17:14:00,0,sweet dan!  glad to see a report from you!  i only make it into those parts every few years and live vicariously through reports like these in the meantime.  i'm hoping i can make it up there sometime in early July!
585946,Grimace,2011-05-23 21:41:00,2020,Thanks for the read.  Those fish are awesome.
585986,Leecher,2011-05-24 00:03:00,7832,Getting back on track is sweet Dan   Congrats on them gems
586052,camillj,2011-05-24 02:27:00,1988,"Wow, some great shots there Dan, bet the long wait made it seem all the more sweet ! Thanks for sharing ! Can't wait for my first trip next weekend."
586087,thalweg,2011-05-24 05:08:00,112,A really good report.  Excellent shots and commentary.
587590,Spiel,2011-05-28 23:21:00,9065,"Holy hot damn!  Not sure how I missed this Dan, okay I am, it went up when I was without internet for three days. I'm glad I went back a few pages and found it, nice, very nice indeed.  I'm happy to see you back in your element and of course I remember the fire, crazy stuff that was. *choke, cough, cough*  Oh and tell Colin to take the factory label off his rod handle, very tacky....."
587604,danc,2011-05-29 00:30:00,4677," Never said anything to Colin, but I was thinking the same thing all weekend. He catches fish so who am I to argue??  How did you survive without internet for 3 days? I noticed you missing and here I thought that you were out fishing or something.  This was a fun report to put together. Glad you all enjoyed it. Thanks for the comments guys.  My next report will be a Brook Trout fishing trip with me and Phaneuf. I put a contest together and Dion was the winner of a fishing trip with me. Second place prize was two fishing trips with me."
587612,fishnsled,2011-05-29 00:53:00,3520,Great report Dan. Those fish just look so purdy. Good to see you back out again.
587622,ehg,2011-05-29 01:21:00,2666,"Another top notch report, having the greatest brook trout water relatively near must be such a treat. You know how to take advantage of that. Awesome report!"
