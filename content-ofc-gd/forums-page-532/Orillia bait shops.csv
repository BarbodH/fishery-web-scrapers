589064,lookinforwalleye,2011-06-02 01:17:00,4399,Does anyone know of any baitshop in Orillia that sell minnows?
589066,Fish Farmer,2011-06-02 01:24:00,2234,"Best place is on HWY 11 Jacobs Bait, Just before the #12 cut off Memorial Drive. Or Tromblys Tackle Box, West St."
589067,cheaptackle,2011-06-02 01:26:00,849,"Ellwood Epps on Highway 11N just north of orillia, Trombly's @ Highway 12 & West St. S, Hook & Bow @ the Narrows are the 3 I know of.  Jacobs (?) bait on 11N just south of orillia, but I'm not sure if they're still in it or not.  Michael"
589068,lookinforwalleye,2011-06-02 01:30:00,4399,"Thanks for the quick replies guys, I did not realize that Trombly sold minnows!"
589100,irishfield,2011-06-02 02:42:00,26272,I believe they open at the rear of the building at 5am to do so Gord.. call and check!
589105,fishboy,2011-06-02 03:11:00,550,Jacobs has great bait and counts
589133,Fish Farmer,2011-06-02 10:38:00,2234,"Just fished there for 9 days, A little tip. When I go to Jacobs I take a 5 gallon pail with a lid, cut a small whole in the center of the lid, run a 120 W aquarium pump plugged into a boaster box with 120 inverter plugs. The aquarium pump is quieter than those battery operated ones and they pump more air. Get extra water in the pail. The pump I use has 2 air lines because I get 2 pails going for 8 guys."
589157,Rizzo,2011-06-02 12:47:00,4754,definitely Jacobs on hwy 11 if they are still open. Ridiculously low prices. I often give a tip when I go there because I can't believe I'm waking someone up at 4 am for $4 worth of minnows
