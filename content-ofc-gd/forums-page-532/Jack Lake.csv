458014,bassman,2010-04-20 01:08:00,384,"Hey gang,  I'm heading up to Jack Lake in Apsley for the boys annual fishing trip at the end of May. Ive heard great things about Jack Lake from some friends, however, there is very little info on the internet. I was hoping that you guys could assist with a couple of things:  - We're staying on the NW part of the lake. Are there any good boat launches in the area? - Does anyone have a map of the lake that they can share? I haven't found anything free online. - Any tips on walleye fishing on Jack Lake? I'm not looking for any honey holes just some pointers, or types of structure to look for.  Any info would be appreciated, and if you happen to be on Jack Lake the last weekend of May, feel free to drop by for a pint.  Cheers!"

458034,jediangler,2010-04-20 01:50:00,1923,Jack Lake Lodge has a ramp in that area. Where are you staying? We fished it for musky several years back and caught one walleye on a bucktail.
458047,adempsey,2010-04-20 02:31:00,1498,"You can order a map from www.TrakMaps.com  You can also view it online for free using their little Zoomify app.  I went up there last year, I really like the lake.  I plan on going back again this summer.  We were only there for a weekend so didn't explore the southern half at all.   There were many weedbeds to fish in the summer.  We caught a musky and some walleye out front of Jack Lake lodge around the little island and in the weedbeds.  Other spots we mostly caught bass and perch from my recollection.  Sometimes it's hard to keep all the different places straight."
458050,bassman,2010-04-20 02:36:00,384,Thanks for the help all. We're renting a cottage on the south end of Sheep Bay.

458099,mepps,2010-04-20 12:41:00,1301,"I grew up fishing Jack Lakes in the summers - I cant help much with walleye though, only caught a few - one was an 8 pounder though!  I used to see a lot of walleye fishermen in Redmond bay (I think thats what it was called) - located in the very north east corner near a small island. There is a buoy about 200 yards from the island where walleye fishermen would sit.   lemme know if you are going again in the summer, I know some great muskie spots!"
458113,Carp,2010-04-20 13:50:00,1488,"I was going to suggest talking to Fishing Fury, but I see he already chimed in. I've never fished fished Jacks myself.  Bring us back a report and pics.  Good luck !"
458262,bassman,2010-04-20 21:54:00,384,Thanks for all of the tips.  Are there any half decent boat launches on the north end of the lake?
458501,mepps,2010-04-21 17:23:00,1301,"Highway 28 to Apsley via Burliegh St (620A), then turn right at the liquor store onto 504, then turn right on to Jack Lake Rd until you reach the lake - you'll find a marina, gas station and launch."
458641,Loonietoon,2010-04-22 01:07:00,1450,Any body know where to camp up there.. will like to go up and stay in the van... Hydro may be good
458655,ckrb2007,2010-04-22 02:23:00,449,"hey Bassman....where are you staying?? Jack Lake Lodge? Jack Lake Tent & Trailer park? Millers Timber Sands?  If you head out from the marina at jack lak lodge, turn right into that little bay.....there's logs lining the entire shore line which is good for bass and muskie (when in season) and in the middle of the bay I've caught several walleye just trolling back and forth. I've been fishing Jacks since I was 2yrs old....lol"
458779,ERB,2010-04-22 17:07:00,35,"There is also another marina down Jack's lake road, just before you hit the water there is a stop sign turn right, and it will be on your left. Anchorage Marina I believe, they have a great launch, and a store with gas.  Good luck"
458783,jediangler,2010-04-22 17:32:00,1923,Miller's Timber Sands has a few camping spots. Great people operate that camp as well.
458860,ckrb2007,2010-04-22 23:25:00,449," Are jack and judy still the owners of Millers....i remember when it was called Leamans. I believe back in the day, Bud Leaman won the park in a poker game!! LOL???? I spent 30 summers over at Jack Lake Tent & Trailer Park."
458862,ckrb2007,2010-04-22 23:31:00,449," If that's the spot I'm thinking of....we use to call it ""the hump"". Great walter fishing there back in the day. Caught many smallies there as well."
458869,TerryC,2010-04-23 00:06:00,196," Yep, Jack & Judy still own the park, it's up for sale though. I have been staying summers at millers for thirty years myself. Bud Lehman still lives in a cottage right beside the camp, and he is still as tough as an old piece of leather. Great guy.  Cheers  Clarence"
458886,Loonietoon,2010-04-23 01:23:00,1450,Thanks for the info on the camping spots I will check them out this summer. Got to get away and do some fishing and relaxing for sure..
473782,bassman,2010-06-08 21:13:00,384,"Got back from the annual fishing trip, and just like the name of the lake, we caught JACK!!! We marked a ton of fishies on the sonar, but couldn't find any hungry ones. Other than a few OOS smallies, not too much to report. The locals were saying that the water levels were down, and the water temps were high for that time of year (app. 25-26C). A few highlites: we did get a couple of rounds in at Marvel Rapids Golf Course. What a great little course. We hand fed some wild deer that were hanging around the cottage.  Thanks again to everyone for the tips and info.  Cheers!"
473872,tschirk,2010-06-09 00:28:00,261,There is a public (free) launch at N end of lake (end of Jack's Lake Road) but watch the sand as you launch - very expensive to be pulled out. (from a friend of mine on Jack's)
589060,bassman,2011-06-02 01:12:00,384,Heading back to Jack Lake next weekend. Hopefully we will find some hungrier fish this year. Does anyone have any reports from the last few weeks?  Cheers!
589082,Garry2Rs,2011-06-02 02:09:00,1425,The lake was closed until Walleye opened up here. I will be out on the lake looking for musky on the weekend.
589109,bassman,2011-06-02 03:20:00,384,"Thanks Garry, what's the bug report like?"
