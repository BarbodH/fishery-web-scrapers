588779,scugpg,2011-06-01 14:18:00,1373,with good clean water? Not sure if they exist all dirty reservoirs down here . For decent fishing? There are a few. Conestogo and Belwood aren't too far from there. Might be worth a bit longer drive though.

588788,bushart,2011-06-01 14:46:00,2628,I'm thinking a guy could spend several years exploring the reaches of the Grand River---big enough to always get away from the crowds (at least was 25 years ago)
588789,scugpg,2011-06-01 14:53:00,1373,"You could try Wildwood, during the week its not too bad."
588805,zman,2011-06-01 15:30:00,179,"I would drive 2 hours, just got the new boat this year so looking to venture some new lakes, I fish Balsam lake allot, lake nipissing and the french river"
