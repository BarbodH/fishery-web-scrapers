588319,pics,2011-05-31 01:49:00,1268,"  The annual Binbrook Crappie Derby took place Sunday and while this goes on we bring a busload of kids from the Eva Rothwell centre in Hamilton out for some fishing..We give them all a fishing rod and a bit of tackle...This year we had 36 show up and many were trying out the fishing thing for the first time ever...chaotic but fun..The kids were very well behaved to say the least!!! They fished for three hours, had as much lunch as they wanted, then headed back to the city dirty, sometimes wet, but happy!!  Many thanks to my fellow Glanbrook Conservation Committee members, Fishing World and the Niagara Peninsula Conservation Authority....."

Next year we have to get some snacks!! 10 minutes off the bus and they're asking for lunch....."
588407,Homer Is King,2011-05-31 12:08:00,305,Great job. That's an awesome program! Exposing kids to the great outdoors. Well done!
588412,Roy,2011-05-31 12:19:00,13728,"Good job getting the young'ns out.  I wouldn't be concerned about the kid not wanting to touch the fish. For all of his life, all he's ever seen on the tube is fishing pros and weathered veterans using boga grips and welders mitts to handle fish."
588423,johnnyb,2011-05-31 12:55:00,3413,"Just great stuff...I'm guessing ""chaotic"" was an understatement....but clearly worth it"
588586,pics,2011-05-31 23:05:00,1268,There are a hundred kids in their program and at least 25 of them show up at the centre for breakfast each day...otherwise they would sit at school hungry....I would rather they get hooked on fishing than the alternative....
588595,GBW,2011-05-31 23:30:00,8460,good for you for helping out each day!
