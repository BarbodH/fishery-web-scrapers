588838,crossover,2011-06-01 16:45:00,172,"Which would you be? I'd probably be a carp, they live long, grow huge (not having to deal with predators), don't use much effort to get food, can live in most environments, and just relax under the sun without giving a damn. Sturgeon live long too, but they can't handle a few wimpy dams."
588839,manitoubass2,2011-06-01 16:48:00,11391,"After watching River Monsters last night, maybe a freshwater eel. Looked like a pretty darn good existence in fish terms, plus they live long apparently."
588842,mattp33,2011-06-01 16:51:00,290,"MUSKIE!  Apex preditor!  Eat everything in sight.  Ok so you get fooled the odd time and bite into a fish with hooks, get pulled around for a few minutes.  Get a bit of fresh air then back to the water!"
588848,cwpowell,2011-06-01 16:56:00,265,Muskies are wimpy too!
588856,Raf,2011-06-01 17:04:00,3495,something with a very short lifespan so I can roll the dice again and come back as something better.
588858,ckrb2007,2011-06-01 17:07:00,449,Sturgeon for freshwater and a Great White shark for saltwater.

588863,206,2011-06-01 17:13:00,563,sunfish or a rock bass....Big enough to bring a smile to a kids face not big enough to be eaten for dinner
588865,DRIFTER_016,2011-06-01 17:15:00,10439,  Might want to look into a white bucket sometime.
588868,ah_long,2011-06-01 17:28:00,354," given how little kids play with the Sunfish once they're out of the water, I would not want to be one..  If FW, a red bellied pirhana, hunt in packs and ferocious  if SW, probably a bull shark, able to adapt to both fresh and salt"
588870,fishing n autograph,2011-06-01 17:37:00,2540,Hmmm good question.... Fresh water I'd have to say a grayling cause they're so purdy! Salt water would have to be something cool like a marlin or sailfish...
588875,Dozer,2011-06-01 18:02:00,896,"FW Ontario fish wise... 30 lb Channel Cat... FW in general, electric catfish sounds pretty fun.  SW, great white...  can you see the trend here?  No body wants anything to do with these fish so I thnk I live a pretty decent life.  Great idea for a thread"
588882,crossover,2011-06-01 18:21:00,172,"Sharks are cool, but there's that whole ""get your fins caught off and thrown back into the water alive and die a slow death"" risk."

588950,Terry,2011-06-01 21:13:00,14456,sperm whale  oh wait..it's a mammal ....  then it's  too girly for me to reply.....
588959,Ron,2011-06-01 21:43:00,1683,If I was reincarnated as a fish I hope it would be an Essox ehcolid majestic. This fish species hasn't been discovered yet but would scare the pants off of beautiful women.
