589187,Leecher,2011-06-02 15:03:00,7832,"Great report, fish and pics Ryan Looks like all 3 of you kids had fun High fives to Averie and Luke I see you got your boat a new look.... NICE Thanks for sharing Jacques"
589197,limeyangler,2011-06-02 15:29:00,5204,"LOL Ryan...just finished a similar post. jack is exactly the same as your little dood, he dont like touching them at the moment.  WOW...Averie is a serious angler, the way she holds the fish fish...the shot holding the rod in her mouth.  gotta say Ryan...what an awesome job you do as a dad...Hats of to you"
587523,The Urban Fisherman,2011-05-28 16:24:00,2050,"It's been a busy spring for me, which always seems to be the case.   We have basement reno's on the go, a ton of yard stuff and exterior home fixes that seem never ending.  But I finally managed to get out on the water May long weekend for a morning of fishing with the kids.  Luke was nervous in the boat at first but warmed up to it and had a ton of fun playing with minnow's and catching fish.... he even managed a short nap in the boat! lol    We did well with the rock bass and I caught a few big OOS smallies while trying for pike, but we came up short on the perch until my good buddy Dan Bouck found some perch....albeit little ones...   Anyways, it was a great morning out on the water with the kids.... Thanks for the perch spot Dano!  While I'm throwing out thank you's I have to send a big shout out to SHIMANO Canada!  I was talking to some of the guys at Facts of Fishing LIVE, asking about smaller rods for kids.  I haven't been able to find something right for Averie as she needed to upgrade from her ice fishing rod..and I live in the sticks so our selection around here is limited.  Wouldn't you know a tube show's up in the mail with a 4 foot 6 inch Voltaeus not a week and a half later.  She's used it twice now, and it's absolutely the perfect rod for her!     On to some pics...  In the yard ready to rock...   Our country road...   Saw this guy on our way so we stopped to take a pic...     Luke was a little nervous at first...   But he was quickly distracted by the minnows...   The perch bite was slow for us so we hit up a tried and true rock bass spot and Averie slammed some big rockies!      Here's Averie doing the ""Mercer Hold"" with her new rod!    Lukes fish... he wouldn't hold it but was very happy to catch it!      Sorry bout the OOS smallie, but I thought it was to good of a picture not to post.  Caught it while tryin for pike, with a 2 year old sleeping on my lap! lol    After that we hit up some perch in Dan's spot...   And the kids fell asleep on the ride home...   So that was our fishing for May long weekend...  Last Night I took the kids out for a couple hours of friday evening Crankbait fishing for Panfish... Luke just played in the fish cooler, but Averie and I caught a few rock bass, crappie, bluegill and some OOS largies and enjoyed an evening on the lake...  Rock bass on the first cast...   Nice dark Crappie..     Biggest Gill of the evening...      Played on the dock and enjoyed a quiet lake before callin' it a night..          Thanks for checkin' out our report... on to house work and until next time!  Cheers,  Ryan, Averie and Luke    [/size][/size]"
