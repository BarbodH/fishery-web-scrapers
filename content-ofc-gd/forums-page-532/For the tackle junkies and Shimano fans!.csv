And if you like the current Curado E series reels, Stradic FI reels, and the Crucial rods then nows the time to pick some up on sale because soon they'll be gone...   Rumour Mill"
588973,GBW,2011-06-01 22:03:00,8460,I bet that is why the curado's are on sale right now too.
589021,Pikeslayer,2011-06-01 23:57:00,1443,Where are the curados on sale? I think I need one.  Slayer
589027,mercman,2011-06-02 00:08:00,7054,  I think you need one too Simon. Mine is hands down the best reel i have ever owned.
589038,Bassaholic,2011-06-02 00:23:00,74,The BPS website has the 200 size on sale right now but I suspect they'll put the rest of the sizes on sale soon too. Lots of other online stores are starting to put them on sale...
589047,GBW,2011-06-02 00:46:00,8460,"yup, BPS has them on for $159 or in that range. I'm still not sure why the US stores are $139. when our $ is better then the USA $."
589048,bigmac1984,2011-06-02 00:47:00,193,I believe fishing world in hamilton is selling them for $159
589080,uglyfish,2011-06-02 02:00:00,981,Maybe everyone is just reailzing how over rated they are and over priced lol
