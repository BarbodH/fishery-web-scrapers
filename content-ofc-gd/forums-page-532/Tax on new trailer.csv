588714,lew,2011-06-01 09:31:00,12766,Morning boyz  I'm having a new tandem axle trailer custom built for my boat and am picking it up next week and am trading in my current trailer.  I think I only pay tax on the price of the trailer after the trade-in has been deducted....am I correct ??
588716,Roy,2011-06-01 09:46:00,13728,"Yes Lew, you've already paid the tax on your current trailer. You will pay tax on the invoice for the custom tandem. Sounds like a beauty...we want pics!"
588717,lew,2011-06-01 09:48:00,12766,"Thanks Roy, I figured it was the same as purchasing a new vehicle.  I'll post a pic when I pick it up."
588734,aplumma,2011-06-01 12:00:00,6896,Are they offering you a fair price for the old one or might you get a few extra bucks from an outright sale Lew?  Art
588736,lew,2011-06-01 12:06:00,12766,We worked an extemely good deal on the trade-in Art and it's something both myself & the dealer are very happy with.
588737,aplumma,2011-06-01 12:09:00,6896,I should have known you had already covered that base good deal Lew.   Art
588740,lew,2011-06-01 12:20:00,12766," When a deal is done and everybody shakes hands with smiles on their faces, life is good."
588755,bigbuck,2011-06-01 13:20:00,2449,"Nice Lew, should make trailering your baby a might easier."
588767,lew,2011-06-01 13:39:00,12766," Your right Bruce and I can only blame myself.  When I purchased the Skeeter 2 years ago (you were there), it came on a custom EZ LOADER and when I checked the capacity plate on the trailer and thought it said it was good for carrying 3950 pounds. I didn't especially want a single axle but figured it was good.  A few weeks back I was cleaning under the boat and noticed the trailer wasn't rated for 3950, but rather only 2950 which is darned near the weight of the boat, motor, 3 batteries and gas before I even add all the other stuff.  Diane keeps telling me to put my darned glasses on  Soon as I noticed how close I was to capacity I ordered the tandem.  No idea why boat companies put new boats on trailers that have very little spare capacity."
588890,Spiel,2011-06-01 18:32:00,9065,I don't know much about anything Lew but I am pretty certain that Diane spoils you!
588922,bigbuck,2011-06-01 19:42:00,2449,"I figure that mine is near the capacity as well but for the amount I trailer, I'm not too worried. Did you go with a galvanized trailer?? Or matching paint?? BTW, you are retired now, enjoy and toss the glasses (ok, don't unless you need them to tie knots)."
588942,Terry,2011-06-01 20:53:00,14456,"and here I always thought as long as you're no more then 40% over gross, you're good to go"
588952,lew,2011-06-01 21:15:00,12766,"  Your 100% correct Chris, and even after 45 years of marriage she still treats me like a Prince      Gonna be painted basically the same color as my current trailer Bruce"
588964,smally21,2011-06-01 21:55:00,993,"2950 is a pretty optimistic rating for a single axle with a 3500 lb axle and 3400 lbs of tire rating (likely). the manufacturer is suggesting it only weighs 500 lbs,which doesn't sound right. and if it does wigh 500lbs, its not built to carry 2950.  good luck with new one!"
588979,lew,2011-06-01 22:26:00,12766," Gross weight is  3650 and the 14"" Marathons are  rated at 1870 each.   Oh well, I'm towing it 20 miles to Pigeon on the weekend for the musky opener and that'll be the final trip with a load on it.  It's an excellent trailer though  with all the options, swing away tongue , LED lights, torsion axle, surge disc brakes, Vault hubs and auto ratcheting rear tie-downs,  It's just not suited for this particular boat."
