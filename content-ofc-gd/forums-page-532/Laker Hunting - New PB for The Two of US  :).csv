588212,Leecher,2011-05-30 21:01:00,7832, Thanks Kev!!!  The technique we used was casting to shore with white tubes and spinners.... Paul had to upper hand with his Black Furry.... Lakers went for it like a magnet   He put in a real clinic with it  I also caught one on a white crank bait I had made   Anything white in this lake produces well   no need for trolling..... we drifted most of the day and it worked very well   Thanks Tyler!!!
588256,Whitespinnerbait,2011-05-30 22:55:00,2038,Mepps Black Fury = Laker Magnet        Highlight of the Day...............Bluejays harrassing a Bald Eagle             Awesome day on the water Jacques
588269,Leecher,2011-05-30 23:16:00,7832, Hey Paul...
