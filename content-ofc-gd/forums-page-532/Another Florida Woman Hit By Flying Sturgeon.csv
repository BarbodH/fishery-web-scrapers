This marks the fifth time in six weeks that a jumping sturgeon has hit a boat down there.  Just when we thought the prospect of getting hit by a 20 pound Asian carp jumping into your boat was scary! Imagine getting hit in the mouth with a 200 pound sturgeon? When you're running at full throttle?  Apparently Gulf Sturgeon run up rivers and jump, particularly in summer. They sometimes collide with boats. I can't even imagine it.  Click the link and scroll down for video of some idiot water-skiing while these things are jumping. Talk about a death wish!!"

588836,GBW,2011-06-01 16:35:00,8460,back in 2007 I was in Fla. and a woman got hit by one and it did so much damage to her it was front page news.  The fish are in there spawning right now and from my understanding the jumping is part of the process
