588954,l2p,2011-06-01 21:18:00,346,"Alot of things changed for me in May. The restuarant has picked up with the warmer weather so work has had me tied down for the most part, the days im not working im usualy out fishing somewhere and any time inbetween consist of eat, sleep, and party. Also after a couple last steelie trips earlier in the month I have focused most of my fishing on warmer water species as its weird for me to fish for steelies when I can wear a t shirt and shorts out. I think its about time I give em a  break anyway and even out my longsleve tan I aquired while fishing in the spring sun with jackets on. I think my next priority is getting a hair cut  :grin:  now onto the pics!                                "
