I fished 2 different areas and depths each day with excellenet results. Sat we fished 15-18 fow and Sun 20-23 fow, we even got a bonus steelhead each day. Sunday I had the good fortune of fishing with Patrick Walsh, editor of Outdoor Canada magazine. This was his first time fishing the area- guess what he's coming back! "
