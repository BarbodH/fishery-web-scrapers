587344,Basskicker,2011-05-27 21:05:00,421,"Well it's been a long time coming, our annual trip WAY NORTH where the wildlife is abundant and the fish big (except this year) lol... I normally write up a nice long report but this year I decided to take video footage to edit and share with you guys.  Hope you enjoy...we sure did!!!  I was a little nervous when I realized how close I was to that bear....my wife was freaking on my   , not the smartest thing I've done but the wind was perfect....to get within 30-35ft    Jason  P.S.-How to you provide the above link to the video on Youtube with the actual video showing up on OFC, simply click and play? Can't seem to figure it out and I know it's relatively simple I'm sure!!!"

587350,kickingfrog,2011-05-27 21:27:00,8333," Did the bear at any point make a sound that may have sounded like ""TJ???""."

587465,ccmtcanada,2011-05-28 10:49:00,7971,"Hey Jason!  Excellent video!!!  Looked like a great time with lots of great memories there.  After hearing your last bear story from that fly-in lake, I don't blame her for getting on you about the bear...LOL!"
587626,fishnsled,2011-05-29 01:30:00,3520,Nice video. I'm guessing the HD GoPro Camera and a Standard def camera. Just wondering what software you used to edit the 2 formats? Thanks for the report.
587657,rob v,2011-05-29 02:51:00,535,Well done - thanks for sharing !!
587836,Basskicker,2011-05-29 19:44:00,421, I used Trak AXPC....pretty impressive software for only $30.00
587853,msp,2011-05-29 21:23:00,1336,That was a cool video. You really know how to camp in style. Great set up at camp. I could stay there forever.

588342,Jds63,2011-05-31 02:31:00,1365,"great video, what kind of mount did you have while filming your boat ride ?"
588394,Basskicker,2011-05-31 11:09:00,421," It's actually the Go Pro HD mount, but I did some modifications to attach it to a extendable painters pole."
588476,fishnsled,2011-05-31 17:16:00,3520, Thanks for the info Jason.
588560,WeedLine,2011-05-31 21:46:00,322,That's the way to do it
588568,Moosebunk,2011-05-31 22:06:00,3970,Very nice Jay.  Sharing some quality outdoor time with the wife safe in your wicked Fort Knox tent is the way to go man.  Enjoyed the video a tonne.
