588945,bucktail,2011-06-01 21:00:00,1857,Has any used them yet? Thinking of adding a couple to my box for muskie before my Geo bay trip in 4 weeks. Any thoughts?
588992,Garry2Rs,2011-06-01 22:51:00,1425,I bought one last year. I worked for pike and bass. In the spring I picked up two more on sale.
589031,Mike01,2011-06-02 00:12:00,378,"I'm planning on getting a few of these as well, they just look so good in the water.  Anyone know if they are on sale anywhere?"
589126,singingdog,2011-06-02 09:42:00,1047,"I've thrown both the Sebile and the Koppers swimbaits for musky with very little to show for them. It could just be the water I am fishing, but a jointed rapala has outfished them both times I have given them a good chance. Guys on saltwater seem to do well with them. There was a really good thread on Tackle Tour about the sebiles...the verdict wasn't good."
589127,Roy,2011-06-02 09:53:00,13728,I haven't tried them yet but I will. I know Pete Maina uses them and he's no slouch when it comes to muskies.
589128,NAC,2011-06-02 10:19:00,369,Sebile is great but I'll take the Storm Kickin' Stick at $10-12 any day for the same usage.  not sure about their durability though?
589176,manitoubass2,2011-06-02 14:18:00,11391," I have to agree with you here. I've used the Sebile for ice out pike and it is a nice bait, it was productive as well. But not more productive than the few kickin sticks I own. And at half the price, I'll pick the Storm lures.  As far as durability, my Storm lures have held up very nicely for 2 seasons, still no need to replace them.  I think I fish the Storm lure with more confidence as well, just not afraid to lose one, as compared to the Sebile lure.  I won't be buying any more magic swimmers"
