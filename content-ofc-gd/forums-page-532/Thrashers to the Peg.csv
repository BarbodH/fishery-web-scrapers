588420,Grimace,2011-05-31 12:36:00,2020,"I heard on the radio that someone high up on the inside has told them that the deal was in fact in place and Bettman was furious about the leak and put everything on hold just to let everyone know who was in charge.  Sounds like typical Bettman.  Brunt is level headed and I will give him the benefit of the doubt.  His track record suggests that his reporting is on the level.  Bettman's track record suggests that he is a control freak and would certainly think nothing of turning this thing upside down for two weeks.  Oh well, the truth will come out eventually.  Edit: spelling"
588437,troutologist,2011-05-31 14:06:00,951,"Apparently all the details will be released at a press confernce at 11am from the MTS Center.  I'm anxious to find out the ticket prices, but will take in a few games anyways. GO JETS! (or whatever your called)"
588438,glen,2011-05-31 14:17:00,2641,How much longer do we have to suffer with Bettman?
588488,Harrison,2011-05-31 17:57:00,2202,"Done deal.  http://""http://www.cbc.ca/sports/hockey/story/2011/05/31/sp-nhl-winnipeg.html""  ""Organizers said ticket prices will range from $39 to $129 per game, and a drive to sell 13,000 season tickets would start this week."""

588494,Lunatic,2011-05-31 19:07:00,536,"great day for manitoba,canada and hockey.now we just need quebec to get its team back and eliminate 2 teams from the league to put more talent back in the pool."
588497,Harrison,2011-05-31 19:12:00,2202,I kinda like:  Winnipeg Pikes or Winnipeg Marble Eyes
588498,manitoubass2,2011-05-31 19:14:00,11391,"I heard on TSN that the Jets is still a viable option for the name. I sincerely hope they keep the original name, thats just my opinion though."
588500,jedimaster,2011-05-31 19:21:00,3472,How about the Wombats? Just like in 3000 miles to graceland. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HCeS-9xkJQI
588501,Headhunter,2011-05-31 19:23:00,5703,"Wow, with all this re-organization, maybe Toronto could get an NHL team? HH"
588509,Governator,2011-05-31 19:40:00,879,While the Jets are the logical choice for the name it's not the ideal choice imo considering that team is in Phoenix.  I'd say go with a new name.
588510,lookinforwalleye,2011-05-31 19:41:00,4399, Well since he recently signed a new 5 year deal I would say 5 years at least
588519,jedimaster,2011-05-31 19:56:00,3472,Maybe we can send Bettman to the OHL after he gets placed on waivers. It would be worth the salary cap hit.
588521,Grimace,2011-05-31 20:02:00,2020,You would never want Bettman screwing up our development system.
588526,lookinforwalleye,2011-05-31 20:13:00,4399,"We`ll see how it goes, selling 13,000 season tickets may not sound like a big deal to some but we`ll see when it comes time to write the check! For example if you want a pair of the best seats you need to sign a 5 year agreement and that is almost 60 grand and 10 grand for the worst seats in the house, it will be interesting to see how fast all these Jets fans are willing to write checks that large. This team will need to sell out every night just to perhaps afford the NHL floor salary and equally as interesting and with all due respect to Manitobians it will be interesting to see if top tier free agents and their families will want to call Winnipeg home. It will be interesting to see how long Thompson is willing to write cheques as well!"
588548,Rod Caster,2011-05-31 21:13:00,5784, Edmonton also has a tougher time attracting players.... I hope the northern climate doesn't scare away too many good players from Winnipeg. The Jets management will decide the fate of this team in the end. A properly run team will do well. As long as they don't trade Teemu Selanne again haha. GRRRR to John Paddock the GM back in those days.
585117,kickingfrog,2011-05-20 01:29:00,8333,"http://www.theglobeandmail.com/sports/hockey/atlanta-thrashers-moving-to-winnipeg/article2029179/  Atlanta Thrashers moving to Winnipeg STEPHEN BRUNT Globe and Mail Update Published Thursday, May. 19, 2011 8:57PM EDT Last updated Thursday, May. 19, 2011 9:07PM EDT  An agreement to sell the National Hockey League’s Atlanta Thrashers to a Winnipeg group which plans to relocate the franchise to the Manitoba capital is done.  Sources confirmed tonight that preparations are being made for an announcement Tuesday, confirming the sale and transfer of the Thrashers to True North Sports and Entertainment, which owns and operates the Manitoba Moose of the American Hockey League and the MTS Centre arena, which would become the NHL team’s new home.  MORE RELATED TO THIS STORY AHL has a Plan B if NHL team returns to Winnipeg Thrashers fans plan rally to try to save team Alberta government won't commit to funding new Oilers arena Gary Bettman, the commissioner of the National Hockey League, is expected to travel to Winnipeg to make the news official.  The announcement would end months of speculation about whether one of the NHL’s financially-troubled American sunbelt teams might move north, filling the void left when the Winnipeg Jets packed up and left for Phoenix in 1996, where they became the Coyotes.  Much of the talk this spring had centred on that failing franchise, which was bought by the league after being placed in bankruptcy by its former owner Jerry Moyes in 2009.  But sources in Winnipeg suggest that the Thrashers had in fact been the primary target of potential owners Mark Chipman and David Thomson all along, and that some months back, the NHL board of governors quietly approved the sale and transfer of the team, pending the negotiation of a purchase agreement between Atlanta Spirit LLC, the Thrashers’ owners, and True North.  In the meantime, no potential owner materialized who was prepared to keep the team in Georgia, and local governments there showed no interest in propping up the Thrashers.  “There seems to be a consensus there is going to be a team in Winnpeg,” former major league pitcher Tom Glavine, who had tried unsuccessfully to find new ownership for the hockey team in Atlanta, acknowledged last week. ““The question is who, and unfortunately the bullseye seems to be on the Thrashers’ back.”  When it appeared this spring that the Coyotes might also be in play, after a deal to sell the team to Matthew Hulsizer underwritten by a municipal bond issue fell apart in the face of political opposition from the Goldwater Institute, the Winnipeg group sought to take advantage of what suddenly seemed a buyers’ market, with two teams available and no other potential owners or relocations sites on the horizon.  After the City of Glendale agreed to cover $25-million of the Coyotes losses for the 2011-2012 season, and the NHL opted to operate the club in Arizona for at least one more year, True North’s full focus returned to Atlanta, and a deal was hammered out this week.  Even before those final negotiations took place, the potential Winnipeg owners concluded an agreement with the Manitoba government which will allow revenues from a sports bar with slot machine to be used for improvements to the arena, and to be used towards the debt service on the building.  That’s consistent with what Manitoba premier Greg Sellinger told reporters earlier this week, when he said that the provincial government had no interest in subsidizing an NHL team, but that the province had financially supported the renovation of the MTS Centre in the past, and would continue to be willing to do so."
585123,Rod Caster,2011-05-20 01:43:00,5784,"Great!!! As a former Jets fan, and current Coyotes fan, I'm in a real bind. Do I stay with the franchise, or stay with the Jets? The two reasons I stayed Phoenix were because I couldn't find a better option (what am I gonna be a leafs fan? ha) and because I figured they'd be the next team to return to Canada. Watch out Oilers, Flames and Canucks. there's a new kid in town. This will make for some great rivalries!"
585131,bow slayer,2011-05-20 01:57:00,1074,Dreger and McKenzie on TSN say this is not a done deal yet.
585133,cjgraham,2011-05-20 02:12:00,104,Woooo! Congrats Winnipeg. What do you guys think about the divisions? You think there will be some shuffling or will Atlanta(Winnipeg)  stay in the southeast
585139,kickingfrog,2011-05-20 02:19:00,8333,Logic would dictate the Blue jackets or wings would move to the eastern conference. Very little logic has been used by any of the people involved in this league for the last 20 years however.
585142,Grimace,2011-05-20 02:23:00,2020," With all due respect, if Stephen Brunt is reporting it, it is done.  Lots of gossip queens out there but Brunt is a reporter first."
585144,Grimace,2011-05-20 02:26:00,2020, Detroit wants it bad but NHL could give it to Columbus.
585151,muskymike,2011-05-20 02:38:00,772," The NHL put a statement out in the first round (I think) that Detroit will not move to the East.  And no, this deal is not done yet, but should be in the coming days."
585152,cjgraham,2011-05-20 02:41:00,104,That means we'll never see a Leaf/Wings Stanley Cup! Oh who am I kidding......
585153,cjgraham,2011-05-20 02:42:00,104,  That means we'll never see a Leafs/Wings Stanley Cup final! oh who am i kidding..........but as always Go Leafs Go!!  
585154,danc,2011-05-20 02:52:00,4677,This would be good news for me as Winnipeg would be the closest Canadian NHL team. Minneapolis is still closer though. I guess I'll have to win some sort of contest and get inside the Winnipeg Thrashers dressing room and meet the team. 
585155,Lostchild,2011-05-20 02:53:00,153,"They say the Thrashers/Winnipeg will play in the east, taking on the Thrasher's 2011/2012 schedule...apparently already made up for this up coming season."
585158,Grimace,2011-05-20 02:59:00,2020," Brunt knows the story is legit or he would not report it.  The jock sniffer reporters are jealous, which is sad."
585160,Grimace,2011-05-20 03:02:00,2020, For one year as this deal is happening too late to make a new schedule.  The season long fight to join the east is imminent between Detroit - Columbus - Nashville.
585161,Dutchy,2011-05-20 03:07:00,416," They missed the scoop.   Even now they are back tracking and saying ""it could happen""."
585180,lunkerbasshunter,2011-05-20 07:05:00,2585,until i hear it out of bettmans mouth i wont believe it.
585183,Twocoda,2011-05-20 08:28:00,4130,Its only fitting Winnipeg should have a team...the Jets never should have left in my opinion ....Winnipeg is Canada's latest BOOMTOWN...the fans and city deserve it....
585199,kickingfrog,2011-05-20 12:15:00,8333, NEVER believe anything from him.
585210,blaque,2011-05-20 12:57:00,2419,Ya i keep hearing bettman is denying it. Drives me nuts. When did sports become this big secret society! Like hes gotta be the one to announce it officially in front of the camera. Blah!! These sports owners are worse than politicians sometimes.
585236,Lunker777,2011-05-20 14:52:00,866," The NHL has comprised TWO schedules in anticipation of this happening. Or at least thats what I heard.  I hope the wings move to the east. That would be awesome. I would love to walk over the leafs 3-4 times a season, as opposed to once every 2 years."
585249,Grimace,2011-05-20 17:24:00,2020,They are saving for three ten team divisions.  East - Central - West.
585291,Carp,2011-05-20 20:06:00,1488,Canada could probably support a few NHL teams. Definitely more fans coming out to games than the southern U.S.  I'd love to see more Canadian teams in the NHL. The best thing for the NHL would be to get rid of Bettman and put a Canuck in charge.
588373,bow slayer,2011-05-31 04:32:00,1074,
588391,Grimace,2011-05-31 10:44:00,2020,It certainly looks that way doesn't it?   I wonder what happened.
588405,bow slayer,2011-05-31 11:59:00,1074,"I'm thinking Brunt badly wanted to be the one who broke the story seeing that there was very little talk about Atlanta moving to Winnipeg. His sources told him it would be done by the Tuesday and ran with it. It does not matter to me or most who breaks the story as long as they move to Winnipeg,but I am sure it matters to them.Hopefully sometime this week."
