588944,Terry,2011-06-01 20:59:00,14456,I have seen some pretty stable pontoon boats....
588947,craigdritchie,2011-06-01 21:03:00,1586,There are some really nice pontoon boats out there. There's a guy on Couch who has one with a 200 E-TEC on it. It almost keeps up to the bass boats!
588951,walking_angler,2011-06-01 21:15:00,23,Any thoughts on Little Lake?
589061,Homer Is King,2011-06-02 01:12:00,305,I've rented pontoon boats on Rice a couple of time. They are perfect for a family with young kids. They can stand up and fish right off the side. The railing keeps them nice and safe.
589075,NAW,2011-06-02 01:47:00,4022,There's a few places to rent Pontoons on Little.  I'm pretty sure there's guys who rent pontoons on Simcoe too.  You just have to be very carefull about the weather.
589078,OhioFisherman,2011-06-02 01:54:00,6623,"It`s all about judgment, some days even a big boat isn`t the safest place to be on rough water.  I ran into a guy one time at South Bass Island with a pontoon boat, like a 24-28 footer? He was on his way to Florida, through the Great Lakes, and inter coastal waterway, an interesting trip. He had sense enough to seek safe harbor at South Bass due to weather conditions!"

Just watch out when the winds get more than 15km/h Today was 25, and I don't think I would want to be out there in a toon."
