588900,appleb,2011-06-01 18:58:00,6,I am planning on going to the islands this weekend to fish for pike.  Are there any areas of the island where fishing is prohibited?  Or is fishing pretty much allowed anywhere you can see water?
588904,Roy,2011-06-01 19:04:00,13728,I'd say you can fish pretty well anywhere. Don't go too far east though....Cobourg is not good at the present time.

589108,ehg,2011-06-02 03:19:00,2666,"If you go, might as well take Center Island ferry. Try fishing corners were channels meet or places where trees are overhanging providing cover. Lots of water and shoreline so be prepared for lots of walking. #4 size spinners or x-rap/husky jerks should be effective. Good luck."
589115,crossover,2011-06-02 04:03:00,172,"There is a marina west of the centre island bridge on the north side, it's fenced off with a no trespassing sign so you shouldn't have any trouble if you keep out. I have seen OPP patrolling on Monday so it's best not risking it. Fishing is great, have had success on every outing this year, good luck and post a report following your adventure."
