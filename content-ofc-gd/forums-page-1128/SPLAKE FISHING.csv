127971,karoloko24,2007-10-30 00:09:00,11,I decided to go after some splake today. Fished a litlle lake north of Kingston in the morning. With the cooler weather the trout are starting to get more agressive and the fishing is going get even better later on. Gold and orage litlle cleo was most productive. We caught all fish trolling down 25ft. Going muskie fishing hope to post some nice results on the forum tomorrow    
127976,Muskieman,2007-10-30 00:19:00,2472,Nice Fish !!  They've just stocked a few lakes up here with new F2 Splake that promise to reach 10 lbs or so ... can't wait for the ice to come!!

127989,Joey,2007-10-30 00:53:00,9122,"Great catch!  There's ""supposed"" to be splake in the cottage lake, but we have never caught them nor has anyone ever seen any.  It gets pretty deep in the lake, but its too small of a lake to troll any distance so we've only ever bottom bounced with no luck.  Good for you  Joey"
