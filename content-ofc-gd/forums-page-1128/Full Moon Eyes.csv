126905,GbayGiant,2007-10-26 05:19:00,1780,"Well it has been good fishing lately (finally water cooled down) What a great night, the moon was so bright no lights were necessary, the water didn't have a single ripple and I was the only boat on the water (at least where I was fishing)  I haven't been skunked all year(knock on wood) I thought tonight was going to be the first, up until dark I hadn't a single bite so I was getting a little worried.  I had my trusty jig and minnow combo ( I rarely use anything else anymore it just works) sticking to the basics.  I thought I had a snag, but then felt the head-shake of what ended up being another Northern 43"" same length as the one in my avatar caught a couple weeks ago but much fatter caught near the same spot, could have been the same fish ? but she had the fall belly. This time she took me a good 10-15 min to get her in the net with the 8lbs mono leader on 10lbs power pro I didn't want to force it to much, the release shot came out good the timer one didn't come out at all, but off she goes into the moon rise.         Still no walleyes, my intended target, but the last 5 nights I've been out I caught my only fish at 8pm like clock work, it was 7pm and dark but I waited it out untill 8pm and the train decided to come through once again. The big one gave me the best walleye fight that I can remember, a good 10 min of tug a war, I thought it could be another pike knowing my luck.  Unfortunately I gave her the club because she had a 1/4oz chartreuse jig in her tummy and I figured she would have died anyway, but nothing gets wasted and I'll be happy to eat this one.  I'm not a firm believer in the full moon thing, but it was good fishing tonight.    22"" released.    30"" and a 16"" that I took home.    And the dinner shot. I made sure to get the cheek meat of the big one, that's the one good thing about big walleyes.   "

127195,Joey,2007-10-27 02:35:00,9122,"Wonderful report and pics.  I got up to let the cat out in the middle of the night last night and could not believe how bright it was out.  I thought the porch light was left on.  Wish I woulda been fishin out in it.  Oh well, I can live vacariously through your report  We'll be heading up to close the cottage tomorrow so maybe we can get a bit of moonlit fishing in ourselves.  Joey"

127609,Dano,2007-10-28 21:40:00,719,"Nice post, thanks. Guess pike do eat at night, huh?"
127619,irishfield,2007-10-28 22:33:00,26272,Yah..that puts that wive's tale to bed aye !
127739,GbayGiant,2007-10-29 03:51:00,1780," Yeah, I've only caught one other little pike that I can remember at night. Maybe she was confused because it was so bright outside with the full moon, and it was really low and the sun just went down ? the moon could have been the biggest factor and gave her a little better sight to see the bait ?  I'm not sure but I'm starting to believe in this full moon phenomenon that people have been talking about:D  .  It's weird though because a guy in another boat the next night caught a pike at 8pm, so I guess they do every once in a while."
