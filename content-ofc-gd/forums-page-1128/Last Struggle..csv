128153,dsn,2007-10-30 18:13:00,1018,The last struggle for carp.This guy alot of convincing before he took the corn. I chummed as usual. Last week they were active. This week I had to rub his whiskers to get him to open up.  Most that I saw last week disappeared.              I couldn't hold him cause my back won't be able to handle it still so I just popped the hook.

Last carp I caught, I had to reach into my bag for my forceps while holding on to my carp rod then scramble down a bank to unhook it at the shoreline...no lifting for me either..."
