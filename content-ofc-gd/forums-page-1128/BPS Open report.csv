When we arrived it was the whos who, of the bass fishing wolrd.  http://smg.photobucket.com/albums/v731/mis...Simcoe07049.flv  Big and small,they were all there. The winds were almost nil, but the forcast was for hard winds come noon and it was not wrong. The morning was the time to get your fish and get them we did not. Managed just a chunky 3+ for our efforts. It was hard to move around once the winds picked up. Reports of 5+ rollers were reportd by some and we were in 4,s our ourself. Most of the day was spent draging tubes,dropshot and jerk baits.The fish that were found on Wednesday by my partner were gone. My good friend Mark Kulic took my advice thou,I said Mark,when you get out there Just drop your bait over the boat and you will get a 7+ smallie and win big fish.LOLJ/K  Mark did win the big fish for the event and it was a horse. Congrats to you.      There were others aswell that did well that we all know.  Greg Klatt          David Chong    JPD    Charles was tucked away on this ride.Think we was having a nap.    Mr. Mercer was well,Mr.Mercer.LOL    The MNR was there to take scale samples and tag. If you catch a tagged fish,please inform the MNR.    http://smg.photobucket.com/albums/v731/mis...Simcoe07050.flv  I leave you with the pics.        Winning team.Just missed the 30 pound mark.

127512,Roy,2007-10-28 15:02:00,13728,Thanks for the update Brian. Looks like a great event. Certainly lots of OFNers in there.

127516,lew,2007-10-28 15:08:00,12767," Thanks Steve, I don't know the name, but certainly recognize the face."
127522,Mark Kulik,2007-10-28 15:25:00,348,"Nice pics as usual Brian, and yes the advice paid off big time!LOL it was an exciting event for Dave Kennedy and myself, the high winds kinda made it tough to fish our technique-drop shoting but we managed to put a decent bag together."
127524,charlesn,2007-10-28 15:36:00,551,"Taking a nap Brian, I wish, more like comatose.  I learned, the hard way as usual, not to experiment with new drugs in a tourney.  I tried Ginger based chewable Gravol instead of the usual double dose of extra-strength Gravol I take before any Simcoe or Erie events.  I went to tie a few knots early and was starting to get the ""yawns"" ""burps"" and general nausea that comes with seasickness within minutes.  By 9:30 AM I was fighting it as best I could, but my heart wasn't in it.  It was good to see so many guys out there braving the weather and bringing in big bags.  My partner caught a 5.26 on the first drift in the first 5 or so minutes.  After that, I had a fish on for about 5 turns of the handle.  That was it.  We were too far from the Virginia Beach restaurant for my plan B, so we stuck it out, but I can't say I enjoyed the day too much as it was a rough ride and got cold and wet and generally nasty.  It's a lot easier to tolerate though when you're catching fish...  lol  Great pictures and congrats to all the prize winners.  Charles"

127750,Terry,2007-10-29 09:41:00,14456,sounds like a rough tough day of fishing great report
127753,Spiel,2007-10-29 10:04:00,9065,"....Hobknobbing with the big names eh Brian, who'd a thunk....lol, and you even bested some of them. Lots of zeros on that tally list, must have been a tough one!"
127832,mart,2007-10-29 16:20:00,93,"Great report Brian, It was awesome to be part of such a great event. Congrats to Mark and Dave on that beast of a smallmouth. Even with some nasty weather/conditions some teams still managed to put it together with some big sacks. My hats off to the organizers and all the teams that fished this memorable tourney. I'll definitely be back next year to erase the donut we ended up with this years. Good to see everyone made it back to the weigh in safe!!!"
128062,misfish,2007-10-30 09:53:00,29133,"Hey Marcel Good to see you out there again. You probly didnt see us because we were in a different boat,but we seen you. Throwing out those two drift socks to hold on the shoal.LOL  We had fish there during the week,but they left,like I had mentioned. Next year I hope to be out there."
128073,mart,2007-10-30 11:37:00,93,"Hey Brian, Even with 2 socks it was hard to fish properly when the wind picked up. It was a very frustrating day for us but enjoyed the experience. Good to see you too and hey at least you got to weigh in a fish."
