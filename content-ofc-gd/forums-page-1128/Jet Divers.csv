128004,Smitty1,2007-10-30 01:38:00,29,Hey Guys  Just wondering if anyone has used these jet divers when fishing Quinte - I just picked one up and thought they would work great on the suspended fish. Is it as simply as attaching your lure - and letting out 100ft of line and it will dive to the determined depth? Why did I purchase the precision angling dive curves....  - oh well.  Looking for input on these.  thanks Smitty

128206,taper,2007-10-30 20:30:00,611,haven't tried them at Quinte but we used them a lot on the charter this summer on Erie and both steelies and pickerel hammered them. We ran the jet divers behind the planer boards.
