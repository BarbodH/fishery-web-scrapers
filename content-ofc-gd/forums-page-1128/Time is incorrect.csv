127541,Kawartha Kev,2007-10-28 17:13:00,281,I just noticed that the time is off for the board I guess it has to do with the old daylight savings time correction. We used to set our clocks back the last Sat. of October but that has changed to the first Sat. in November this year which will be next weekend. My computer asked me to update my time as well its nat a big deal just thought I would let you know.  Kawartha Kev

May be that the script for the time was set prior to the new DST rules, but generally those scripts are set to read the time at the server so it may be on the server that the time script is incorrect."
