What are your thoughts, pros-cons ?  from everything ive read its a hunting machine.  345 fps with a 60 yard kill range.  i dont figure on taking any shots that far, i have been using a compound, but worry too much about not making a clean kill so i havent even let one go this year.  any input would be greatly appreciated.  jason"

Make sure everytime you noodle the bow the white marks are parrallel with the rails for a consistant anchor. I had an Excalibur Wolverine years ago..deadly accurate. Happy huntin'.

It shoots flat to about 25 yards and at 30 or more you have to raise.  I did practise to 40 and 50, but I would not take anything over 30 yards in the field, preferably less."
