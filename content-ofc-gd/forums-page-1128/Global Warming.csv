127770,Gerritt,2007-10-29 11:26:00,6129,Here is an interesting article about our beloved David Suzuki .... be sure to listen to his Podcast concerning fishing... I am sure you C&R guys might have something to say about it....  http://www.macleans.ca/science/environment...025_10435_10435  Has he sold out?  Please lets keep this one civil...  Gerritt.

127852,fishindevil,2007-10-29 17:26:00,6254,"Well i dont agree with his view on C & R    but hey,he is a very smart man and usually knows what hes talking about.  ..so evryone is entitiled to their opinion right???   cheers"
127951,pikehunter,2007-10-29 23:12:00,1659,I had respect and admiration for Suzuki when I was young. It faded once I entered into adulthood... a long time ago. Only my 2 cent opinion.  Maybe he needs to be taken out on a real good fishing trip to set him right  A day with Chronzy??
