127845,troutologist,2007-10-29 17:05:00,951,Has anyone done any walleye fishing in this PP or area? How is it? Im going to be in the area this weekend and thought Id bring the canoe along hunting to try for a last kick at the walleye can until ice.  Any info is appreciated especially a suggestion of a lake.  Thanks folks
