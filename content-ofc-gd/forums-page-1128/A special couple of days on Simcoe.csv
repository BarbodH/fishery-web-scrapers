I had the pleasure of sharing a day on Simcoe with non other than Gord Pyzer, Gord is an awesome angler, writer and all round nice person, we basically practiced together, while Gord did some research on Goby -type lures, as if that wasn't thrilling enough, Dave Kennedy and I finnished 10th and caught a 7.02 smallie which took big fish at the BPS open, it capped another awesome season for me fishing with some great anglers and freinds, I learnt a lot and have some great memories, heres a couple of pics. one is Gord with a nice drop-shot Simcoe smallie, the other is good freind Rob Broadbridge on a small lake a couple of weeks ago. all fish were released.
