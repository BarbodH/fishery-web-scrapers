127698,Joey,2007-10-29 01:18:00,9122,"Paul and I headed up to his parent's cottage for our yearly closing of the cottage, shutting off the water and final fish there.  The drive was nice and it threatened rain most of the way, but didn't.  I noticed most of the trees had lost their leaves and the fall colours are almost gone.    The cottage driveway.    We unloaded our gear and headed to the other side of the lake to launch the boat.  We noticed the wind had picked up as we drove around the lake and by the time we launched, it was quite nasty.  Paul drove across and docked and I drove the truck back to the cottage.  In this short period of time, it started raining and the wind was getting quite obnoxious  It poured the rest of the night with wind gusts up to 80 kph and some thunder and lightening thrown in for good measure     The satellite TV came in useful and our BBQ'd shrimp were tasty  So we got up this morning and it was a bit more chrisp outside than Saturday, but no rain    and the wind had died down a bit.  Paul fished with a spinner and I tried a plastic on a weedless.  This lake only has bass in it and we're quite familiar with their favorite haunts so we threw what we knew at them.  They obviously didn't like the weather pattern that had emerged in the last day as they were not too cooperative.  Paul started with this little guy.      My lure wasn't producing too well so I took a pic of my favorite rock on that lake, it has two faces.  Well, I see faces anyhow    Paul caught another little guy and then it started to snow, yes snow  Then, bam, he caught a beauty!!!    The Bob Izumi hold    Looks like it was eating not too badly for this time of year.    And.... the release    I ended up with the big skunkaroo, but at least I was warm in my new Gore-tex pants from Cabelas    So we headed back in, shut off the water and hydro and packed it in til next year.   Cheers,  Joey"
