128286,pikehunter,2007-10-31 00:05:00,1659,"How do you tell the difference between a Canadian Police Officer, Australian Police Officer, and an American Police Officer?  Pose the following question:  You're walking down a deserted street with your wife and two small children. Suddenly, a dangerous looking man with a huge knife comes around the corner, locks eyes with you, screams obscenities, raises the knife, and charges. You are carrying a Glock 40, and you are an expert shot. You have mere seconds before he reaches you and your family. What do you do?  CANADIAN POLICE OFFICER Answer: (Immediate thought processes) Is the knife a ceremonial kirpan? Does he prefer to communicate in English or French? Will this negatively impact my chances of promotion? Is this just his way of telling me that he pays my wages, and wants my job? Would this be an appropriate time to hug him and sing Koombaya? Will the media do a profile of him and how he was loved by everyone including his dog? Is the alleged ""client"" a member of the NDP or an Environmental Group? Is he just a squeegee kid / pan handler trying to make a living on the mean streets? Is he a member of a gang that is just ""misunderstood"" by society? Is he a recent illegal immigrant to this country, and just doesn't know how to approach the police? Is he recently released on parole and hasn't been properly integrated back into the community? Is he a victim of fetal alcohol syndrome and just doesn't understand what he is doing? Is he a member of the Muslim community or other visible minority group? Warn and Charter him as he approaches.    AUSTRALIAN OFFICER Answer: BANG!    AMERICAN OFFICER Answer: BANG! BANG! BANG! BANG! BANG! BANG! BANG! BANG! BANG! BANG! BANG! BANG! Click....
