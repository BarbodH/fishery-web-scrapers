When we awoke Saturday morning and looked out the back we saw the perfect walleye chop on the water complete with overcast skies and a thick mist on the water. I wanted to finish the front steps I'm building but my Bride insisted we go fishing (SIGH).... Out we went..... One pass of our MilkRun and Charmaine hollers out...FishOn Pete.... She waits for me to re-position the boat and passed the rod to me, She did the net job and after I removed the hooks, For the first time ever she actually took hold of the fish like a pro for a quick photo before SHE gleefully released this beauty...her smiles will last me a life time.   I swear to the good lord...that smile and her success was so much more important then finishing those front steps and will be the happiest of memories.....  We did go out again on the next day, the Sunday evening,  and she blew it all to heck......again, a great memory tho as She...Hollers Out... Fish-On Pete.......... OOooops.....was still letting line out and never closed the bail........ I watched in disbelief as the spool emptied and another spinner bait was lost to a toothy critter. Ahhhhhh such is married life and fishing with the one the matters most in your life.... All in All..........Memories are made of these things...I love it! I hope everyone of you at some point can enjoy the moments we shared this past weekend. -bNb"
