There are a lot of talented anglers on this board.....I enjoy reading every one of your reports as well as learning from them.  I have a few questions about freezing fish.......What is your preferred method of freezing fish?  Should I add water to the freezer bag?  How long can I keep my fish in the freezer before it's not good to eat or freezer burnt?  Thanks."
127717,Hooked,2007-10-29 01:56:00,891,"I add water too the freezer bag and the fish seems to keep pretty well for a year.  Nothing beats fresh fish though, but the fish I've had in the freezer for a year still tastes good.  I just cut the edges that got freezer burn on them."
127718,Deano,2007-10-29 02:12:00,767,"Add water if your won't be eating the fish for over a month, if you plan on eating it soon, just freeze them. Adding water will stop freezer burn."

127726,huntervasili,2007-10-29 02:31:00,1604,Yup... I have done both Vaccum and water... when the vaccum is unavailable I always add water in the bag to cover the fillets... Lasts as long as I need it to in the freezer
127729,wallyboss,2007-10-29 02:37:00,1095,"1)Put about 6"" of water in your sink. 2)Put your fillets in a plastic bag. 3)Put bag under water to get all the air out and use a twist tie to close the bag. 4)Put your bag into another bag and fill that one with water. 5)Put in the freezer.  I used to add water in my bag with fillets but I found that for some reason the fillets tasted like water a bit. This way the water is not in contact with your fish but it still protects it from freezer burn.   Or get a vacuum sealer."
127749,Spiel,2007-10-29 09:34:00,9065,"....I honestly can't remember the last time I froze fish. Reason being I just prefer them fresh and if that means eating fish a couple of nights in a row then I do. And to be honest I'm lucky enough to have kids that love fresh fish and don't complain if I'm lucky enough to catch a few meals worth.  But that of course does not answer your question. So if I have to freeze them then I freeze them in water (I used filterd water, no chlorine). With softer fleshed fish (ie: whitefish) I found that soaking them in a weak brine solution for several hours then freezing them in the brine gave me a much firmer and tastier fish when thawed. It's lso a good idea to allow them to thaw slowly in the fridge rather than at room temperature."
127815,Moosebunk,2007-10-29 15:23:00,3970,"plastic wrap, then plastic wrap, then plastic wrap again.  TIGHT.  Never put water in, don't have a prob with freezer burn.  Ideally, vacuum sealing is da bomb."
