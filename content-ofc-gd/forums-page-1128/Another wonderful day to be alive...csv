127999,Smokey,2007-10-30 01:24:00,1278,Congrats guys. Great looking fish and a good day on the water.
128035,ccmtcanada,2007-10-30 02:54:00,7971,Wow...I'm gonna buy all my stuff from you so you can install it...LOL.  If I show up with stuff does that count too?  Looked pretty rough and chilly out there....snow did you say?  I thought you couldn't swear on this board!!!  Nice muskie....will read the report.
127646,irishfield,2007-10-28 23:44:00,26272,"Up early this morning to see the sun come up. Wasn't ""Lew O'clock"" or anything...but it was 7:30.    Was waiting for this ugly bugger to show up...so we could install the motorquide wireless he was buying off me. Full service sale...how many used items have you ever bought that included installation? LOL I made Terry do the grunt work...I just drilled the holes and prepped the bolts for length.       We got that all done about 10 and headed down to the boat launch with my Lund and set out in search of Esox.     Looked like it was going to clear up...and no sooner did that thought cross our minds than it was snowing, sleeting, raining and the wind started up again.     These don't look that big in the pics...but we put them over my bow. Some were going 5 feet or so.    Terry checking his bait is clean..   Oh...and we did put a fish in the boat..I'll let Terry tell that one when he adds his pictures/video. Not too long...but chunky.     Cheers, Wayne"

127666,tbayboy,2007-10-29 00:15:00,1497,He did all the installation work so it was nice of you to 'let' him catch a fish .  Great job guys.
127673,Terry,2007-10-29 00:27:00,14456,"I would like  to thank Wayne for installing the motor and for the day of fishing I had a great time.. did he say that it rained   snowed  hail  sleet and big waves too that boat really handles the big water well and I had to keep checking to see if the motor was running man you can't hear it  Wayne had a spot in mind that he thought we would have a good shot at getting a muskie   as we trolled near the spot he said it should get shallower about here...right on cue ...yup we were on the spot then he said now it would be perfect if one of the reels started to sing..... he barely got it out of his mouth and the clicker on my reel started singing away  reeled her in and got that muskie..  I did a small video to see if it would show the big waves but it didn't show up that well  <embed width=""448"" height=""361"" type=""application/x-shockwave-flash"" wmode=""transparent"" src=""http://i25.photobucket.com/player.swf?file=http://vid25.photobucket.com/albums/c52/Mrbeee1954/DSCF3131.flv""></embed>   great way to spend a lazy sunday "
127675,mistyjr1,2007-10-29 00:34:00,97,Great Pics and Nice Fish!!  But I really think those waves are photoshoped  Corey
127704,Joey,2007-10-29 01:29:00,9122,"WOW  Whuda thunk it, a musky on Wayne's boat  Nice fish for sure, way to go Terry  Man those waves a nasty.  Cool video too.  Joey"
127708,Whopper,2007-10-29 01:38:00,2174, Wayne's seems to be catching on to musky fishing  Good on Wayne and Terry for getting out
127710,Mike the Pike,2007-10-29 01:39:00,3421,I really like the first pic Wayne the Pink sunrise oh and Terry lying down on the job.  I was in some pretty big waves yesterday.  Nice fish Terry.
127713,irishfield,2007-10-29 01:42:00,26272," LOL Phil..the biggest thing I think is confidence, and Mr. Thorpe instilled a LOT of that in the 4 days Dano and I spent with him."
127720,fishdawg,2007-10-29 02:14:00,912,confidence definetly a must to have for all species good on ya for finally getting that boat slimey there Wayne
127727,huntervasili,2007-10-29 02:34:00,1604,Nice fish! WTG and may you have many more with the new motor
127732,GbayGiant,2007-10-29 02:56:00,1780,Nice fish guys.  What lure and how fast were you trolling ?
127733,irishfield,2007-10-29 03:00:00,26272,Want the coords too John? LOL  4.8 MPH and a natural coloured bait.
127736,Bly,2007-10-29 03:20:00,1556,"Nice deal you got there Terry....great new toy, full installation and a nice fish!  Nice report Wayne.....starting to look like you are a prety good guide...lakers and now Musky!"
127741,GbayGiant,2007-10-29 04:00:00,1780," Yes please.  I was down there when I picked up my motorguide at backwater last year for the first time, looked like a real nice area. I was looking at some of Brians fat muskies, some biggins out there. I asked him for his gps cords but he wasn't interested (jk)."
127752,Spiel,2007-10-29 09:57:00,9065,"....Why is it that photos never really seem to do wave hieghts justice? Though you can definitely tell in the video clip that the bow of that big Lund is bouncing quite a bit. Good job on the musky, I'm sure it'll only be a matter of time before you find yourself connected to a leviathan.  Now what boat have you installed that Motorguide on Terry?  And Wayne being the generous guy that you are, if I was to buy a prop off you would you be able to install a boat and motor on it."
127754,Dano,2007-10-29 10:06:00,719,"Well done guys, nice to break the boats GB muskie cherry!"
127757,Terry,2007-10-29 10:19:00,14456,the trolling motor went on my 16 ft sylan
