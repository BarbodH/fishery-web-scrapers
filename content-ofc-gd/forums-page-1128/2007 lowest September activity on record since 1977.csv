Here's a link stating the season was so far the lowest since 1977 compared to the predictions that storms will increase.  ""Unless a dramatic and historical flurry of activity occurs in the next 9 weeks, 2007 will rank as a  historically inactive Tropical Cyclone year for the Northern Hemisphere as a whole.""  COAPS"
128083,Terry,2007-10-30 12:53:00,14456,so are they going to blame this on global warming too  oh..wait Gore said global warming is the cause of the more frequent storms  I am so confused
128088,Hookset,2007-10-30 13:12:00,367,"It's kinda funny how we get one year of inactivity, or one year of storms and people (scientists etc) start making predictions on what's gonna happen next. This planet has more surprises coming and there ain't no crystal ball to predict it. Lowest activity since '77....big deal...that's only 30 years ago. Not even a ""speck"" in time for old mother Earth. People have been keeping track of things like this for maybe the past 100 + yrs. It's like driving a new car for 10 feet and deciding if it's gonna last 100,000 miles or not. I don't think there is any way at all to predict what's coming next. But some scientist somewhere will try and justify his job by putting together some data and a chart to illustrate it. You're right Deano, they need to stop trying to predict the future. It can't be done (by humans anyway).   Hookset."
