127826,Cookslav,2007-10-29 16:04:00,1457,"This is one boat I will NEVER part with...  This little Car topper gets me into areas only a canoe can do, but its stable enough to stand and cast. With her swivel seats, and Electric motor its incredibly easy to control how and were you fish even in flowing river situation. And Rocks/shallow water are merely speed bumps being it only rides about a foot in the water! Best $600 I ever spent by far, and Many decent fish caught in this peice of plastic LOL!  Then I have old faithful who will also NEVER leave my side...    Durable...bit heavy compared to most kevlar models, but she's got me in and out of Algonquin, and many back country tips with out incident (knock on wood...) Lot of memories in this Toy  And my newest, yet oldest Toy (1969) Just got this one back in the summer from a fellow OFC'r I have only had her on the water a total of 2 times thus far LOL.... But I have one more Quinte trip in store yet and I just mounted my rigger plates, and rod holders, so I'm ready for next season!         And I've officaly been told by the missus that I'm not allowed any more boats unless I sell atleast one of the 3 LOL!"

And her we are giving her the fall clean up last year.   And with the cover on   Nothin' fancy, but a solid well made boat that does the job. Sometimes I think that maybe I should have bought a used larger console model with more power, but I wanted new at the time and it has worked out very well for us and I am happy that I did go this route when I purchased it."
