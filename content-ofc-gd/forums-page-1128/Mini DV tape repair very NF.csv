128103,Headhunter,2007-10-30 14:12:00,5703,"of a place in the GTA that will repair a Mini DV tape that got eaten by my video recorder? We had a celebration at my home recently and we video taped the opening of the presents for my 4 year old. After everyone left, my family and I decided to watch the tape. After our viewing, I tried to re-wind the tape to the front, only to have it get chewed by the camera! I have some experience splicing magnetic tape and gave it a go numerous times, to no avail. I'm guessing that the digital code that the camera places on the tape (something like SMPTE) is not allowing the machine to run it properly? Anyway, does anyone know of a shop that will repair this tape... too many memories on it, to just throw away! Thanks, HH"

128107,ccmtcanada,2007-10-30 14:34:00,7971,"Just did a bit of research....here are a few places in Ontario...one in Thunder Bay and one in Toronto that says they can repair mini dv.  The Toronto charges $25 to repair it (actually, they cut out the damaged part).  Even though their ad doesn't mention MiniDv, they said they can repair them when I called them.  http://www.chromaservices.ca/multimedia_se...udio_tapes.html  http://www.torontohomemovies.com/index.php?tapes"

128300,charlied,2007-10-31 00:21:00,584,there is a place here in niagara falls too...they splice it but it will only play 1 time after so your better off to dvd record it once you get it fixed
