128072,bucktail,2007-10-30 11:27:00,1857,Brought the baby in to have her gas gauge fixed up at Bay City Marina yesterday and of course I had to grab a new 2008 Lund brouchure. After drooling and leafing through it for 30 minutes I realize to my horror Lund has dropped the Mr. Pike lineup!!! Guess they are trying  to get people to move up to the ProV series since there is nothing between that and the sports series now. Next one was going to be a ProV19 anyway but the Mr. Pike offered the best value I thought.  D
128084,tonyb,2007-10-30 12:57:00,1637,"I think they have some comparable models to the Mr. Pike now.  Check out the Fisherman series and the Sport Angler, a step down from the Pro-V but still pricey I think...  Tony"
128085,irishfield,2007-10-30 12:59:00,26272,My only reaction to the 2008 catalogue was to darn near puke when I saw the seat colours/design !
128094,bucktail,2007-10-30 13:26:00,1857,You have that right....man those seats are damn ugly!!!!!!!!!!
128095,Roy,2007-10-30 13:30:00,13728,"Seats were designed by the same guy who designed the ""Loser"" hats?"
128097,ccmtcanada,2007-10-30 13:31:00,7971, The loser hats...had to bring that up again Roy?  You wouldn't happen to have a picture would you??
128098,irishfield,2007-10-30 13:33:00,26272,Guess the same guy that designed their 2007 hat still works there!  
128099,irishfield,2007-10-30 13:33:00,26272,HAHA took me 4 minutes to find my picture Roy!
128101,ccmtcanada,2007-10-30 13:36:00,7971,LOL...you're pretty fast Wayne...I figured someone would post it...just thought it would take longer than 2 minutes....
128436,Seaweed,2007-10-31 13:00:00,135,I thought I heard somewhere that Lund was supposed to bring out a fiberglass bass boat this year too.... hmmm.  Not in the catalogue though.  I think they are replacing the Mr. Pike with this boat... Sport Angler Outfitter Edition looks similar... can you believe they show eight guys in the thing????? Be fun casting with that many guys in a boat that is only eighteen feet long.
