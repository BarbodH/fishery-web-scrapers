127783,cranks bait,2007-10-29 12:50:00,721,"Wow, am I glad I stayed here.  Nice to see some fish in the boat, but the waves????  I was thinking about heading down, but they were forcasting 20 km winds so I stayed home to fish.  Glad I did.  We had high wind here, but almost flat water."
127813,Moosebunk,2007-10-29 15:16:00,3970,Tough conditions.  Be happy you got a few with that.  Some nice ones.
127818,Headhunter,2007-10-29 15:40:00,5703,"Thanks for the report Mike! Always nice to hear how BOQ is fairing. It's been my experience that, if your catchin Sheepers, your probably trolling too high in the water column. For what it's worth. HH"
127847,Badger Shark,2007-10-29 17:09:00,291,"Headhunter, I caught my first sheephead yesterday and it was caught at the 30-35 ft depth, WHAT A FIGHT!  Didnt mind catching theat at all."
127440,Mike the Pike,2007-10-28 03:11:00,3421,Headed down the 401 once again to my favorite fishing hole The Bay of Quinte. Stayed in Lancaster Ontario at my good friend Kenny's cottage very close to Lake St.Francis on the St.Lawrence I have never got up this early to go fishing ever.  We got up at 3:10am which I believe is usually last call in the bars in Quebec. So anyway I got up way before Lew O'clock   Next was a quick stop for gas and a 4am visit to Timmies.  Next was the 3 hour drive from Lancaster to Picton.  We were on the water at 8am and I think we secured the only 2 remain parking spaces in Picton Harbour 2 of our Buds who travelled with and Dave from Newmarket Danny from Brossard .Dan tried out his new roof on his Princecraft complete with closed in front no eyes for them but Dave landed a 15 pound sheeps head.  Next we met up with these guys my Cousins Percher(Dan)and his Brother Brent ya full roof and propane heater WOOSIES  Am I jealous hell yes I am.  My chauffeur for the day my friend Kenny oh and a nice shot of that quiet running Mercury 4stroke After washing lures for 2 hours I finally got this girl weighing 8 pounds even and 28 inches long. Unfortunately after 30 minutes of trying to revive her she died so we had no choice but to keep her for consumption.     It was Kenny's turn he was hoping for a big eye but turned out to be this 11lb sheeps head.   That concluded out day a 4pm it was just too rough out there on the Bay.     We did see Tracker in his new Islander cruising up the reach sheltered from the Quinte elements. tried to wave to ya Don but you were cruising to fast. This is the only shot I got of Don in the Islander but its just a speck.      This is a shot of the full moon when we arrived at Kenny's cottage at 8pm the moon over hanging Lake St.Francis.  A helluva a drive for just the day for  2 fish but I had to get out there.  Once again the lucky Lure of choice was the Yozuri hydro minnow 7 inches long.  Looking forward to November at Merlands G2G.  Now I really must go to bed I am really beat from the pounding of the waves.  Mike the pike
127443,Dondorfish,2007-10-28 03:21:00,1000,Nice Eye there Mike!  We got skunked and like you we headed off the water around 4 - waves were unreal! Sorry that I didn't see you - but I was looking! Its amazing how many of those funny lookin' yellow jumpsuits were out there! - lol. I was monitoring channel 72 on the marine radio listening for fellow OFC'ers but didn't hear from anyone.  might go back down there again next weekend if the winds die down - just to far from Niagara to run down there if they haven't subsided.  I know what you mean about the early start - 2:45 for me - and now I am beat! Congrats again on the Eye - nicely done!   Don
127447,fatherof3,2007-10-28 03:38:00,1769,congrats on the nice fish
127462,lew,2007-10-28 10:44:00,12767," Jeeeeez Mike, the days half over by 3:00 AM  Thanks for the fish'n story, sounds like you & the rest of the crew had an excellent day on Quinte. That's one body of water that can definetely get very nasty when the wind blows up and some times you just have to call it a day.  You had a long day but well worth it !!"
127467,solopaddler,2007-10-28 11:49:00,8605,"Nice report Mike. Yozuri hydro minnow eh? Damn, gotta buy another lure!"
