140736,danbo,2007-12-08 19:13:00,2646,"Alfredson is great, a playmaker & goal scorer & leader!  Mum says ""Antropov!"""
140740,misfish,2007-12-08 19:34:00,29133,"Come on,it,s CHRISTMAS."
140741,holdfast,2007-12-08 19:34:00,1813,"My pick would be ovechkin.  yupper a Russian, but I like him, same with Kasparitis.  They play like the way I grew up.  dig, dig, dig.  carp slap me for spelling mistakes"
140743,misfish,2007-12-08 19:39:00,29133,"Now theres one guy that does a job,and ya want to smoke him into the boards. LOL"
140744,iceguy,2007-12-08 19:41:00,341,"I say Lecaliver is the most compleat player, but there could 10 other players nipping at his heels."
140747,holdfast,2007-12-08 19:57:00,1813,"hey, my old man, (recently passed away) hated him, even called him a disease ( Kasparitis)because of the name.  But I liked him when he took on Lindros, obviously one sided.  But I have to give him some respect for his KOHONOS.  By the way, I still havent seen the light and still think, that our Canadian Teams should Lose their European Captains."
140749,Grimace,2007-12-08 20:06:00,2020,Lecavilier
140758,holdfast,2007-12-08 21:04:00,1813,"You make a very good point.  Sidney is a owners dream.  But as a coach who would you pick for your Team.  Sidney, Ovenckin, Vinney, Jerome. Phanuf, Alfredson, Koivu, Sundin, Jager, Lecalvier, or how about Tucker or Higgens ( Canadians Taste for the Week)"
140760,JohnF,2007-12-08 21:26:00,3494," I doubt I'd ever pick Tucker. He's fun to watch, but he's too penalty prone. I want 5 skaters on the ice at all times, but if we gotta take two, then make it a ""good"" penalty.  JF"
140767,holdfast,2007-12-08 21:42:00,1813,"JohnF, You definately know your hockey.  So I got a question for You.  W#hen the Mtl Canadians last won the cup.  There was a young ( first Year)  Players that was on the fourth line( at least what I remembered) Tucker was One.  Stevenson was the other, who was the third.  I still think back how they reminded me of the Hanson Brothers slap shot"
140768,holdfast,2007-12-08 21:45:00,1813,Just a hint.  All were from the Western Hockey league.
140776,brifishrgy,2007-12-08 22:46:00,559,  I pick Tucker .. just cause ..
140864,xrap,2007-12-09 04:08:00,683,Wade Belak. He's on fire guys. First goal in 4 years!!!!!!!!!
140877,JohnF,2007-12-09 04:32:00,3494," I didn't remember him that early so I had to look it up. He was drafted in '93 but didn't play with Montreal until '96  so I'm not sure of the answer. I was never a big Montreal fan, even when there were only 6.  JF"
141244,Cookslav,2007-12-10 13:34:00,1457,"Are you refering to Corsin? He was not a rookie that year, but he was there..."
141396,kennyman,2007-12-10 21:37:00,737,"I guess I''ll go with Lecavalier too. What a line in Tampa! Imagine Sid the Kid on that line. I heard one of the big three from the Lightning is going. Lecavalier would look good in blue and white,don't you think? I can't believe nobody has mentioned Luongo. The guy's unbelievable, and in this day and age the way the game is being played, goaltending is incredibly important."
141420,chickenhawk,2007-12-10 22:21:00,612,Danny Alfredsson probably the best all around hockey player in the league and for goaltenders I would have to say Ryan Miller.
141983,blaque,2007-12-12 16:29:00,2419,"Id take Ryan Miller in a shootout every time. No questions! But hes definitely struggling so far this year. His defense has hung him out to dry on many occasions however. Gotta get tallinder back and numminen will be a welcome site when he returns for sure. Buffalo is on a severe roller coaster this year......Heck in the last few games they crushed Carolina 8-1, lost out west to LA 8-2 then beat San Jose the next game 7-1, and back home for a loss to boston 4-1. Its been a rough ride so far!"
140615,holdfast,2007-12-08 03:40:00,1813,Curious! Why and Prove it
140621,Zib,2007-12-08 03:54:00,369,Henrik Zetterberg
140623,jjcanoe,2007-12-08 03:57:00,744,My pick would be Lecavalier right now.  Slumped for the first 2 weeks of the season then exploded for the points lead.  (after giving everyoneelse a 2 week head start)!!  jjcanoe
140625,holdfast,2007-12-08 03:59:00,1813,Why Zetterburg
140627,jnic,2007-12-08 04:03:00,158,"jerome iginla does it all. score, fight, lead and hits. just imagine if he had another offensive player to play with."
140629,jjcanoe,2007-12-08 04:07:00,744, They've said the same about Sundin for years as well.  jjcanoe
140630,Dondorfish,2007-12-08 04:07:00,1000,Hands down - gotta be Brian McCabe!  Every other team in the NHL wants him . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . to stay on the Leafs!  LOL   Sorry - couldn't resist!   Don
140631,holdfast,2007-12-08 04:07:00,1813,"JJ.  I wouldnt dispute you as he is finally not a kid anymore and now he is maturing.  But there is a Russian that is scoring, fighting and hitting who would be my pick."
140636,holdfast,2007-12-08 04:11:00,1813,"Oh yea, he is young and enthusiastic"
140639,Zib,2007-12-08 04:21:00,369, I say he’s the best right now because he’s been a great clutch player this year. When the Wings needed him to score he came through for them. He just had a hat trick tonight. Of course Don Cherry wouldn’t say he’s the best because he hates European players.
140641,holdfast,2007-12-08 04:33:00,1813,"That's Ironic because that's what the Radio Host said also when he asked his audience their Opinion.  He mentioned him (Zet) because of being an excellent two way player.  You see the problem is that all I see is Mtl Games who play only in their division.  So everybody thinks the best player is Crosby.  WRONG OOO. there is another league, within a league"
140649,KyleM,2007-12-08 05:19:00,218,"Gonna hafta go with Lecavalier and Timmy Thomas for netminders.  Lecavalier wont be the best for long, St Louis is gettin dealt to save coin.  Best save percentage in the league for TT and his GA aint to shabby either.  If the Bruins C gets back this year they are looking fine and dandy."
140651,joonmoon,2007-12-08 05:26:00,528,Tim Thomas for sure. That guy faces 25-35 shots average a nite and he pulls off some wicked saves. Thats why he's hurt right now trying to make a big save...Watched him the other nite...looked like a pulled groin....owww might be a few games off. Savard ain't no slouch either wicked assist man.
140652,holdfast,2007-12-08 05:29:00,1813,"Then you got Joe Thornten, check out his points to the rest of his team totals.  Just awesome"
140673,darsky,2007-12-08 11:44:00,586,your racist against foreign born players anyways-proved that in the past
140676,lunkerbasshunter,2007-12-08 11:52:00,2585,vinny is number one right now but come on we all know sid is going ot run away with it eventually.  Cheers!
140689,DrPhil,2007-12-08 12:47:00,30,I'm surprised nobody mentioned the kid from Pittsburgh  Sid Crosby
140704,dobee,2007-12-08 13:45:00,301,ovechkin by far.... hes carrying the capitals...
140706,JohnF,2007-12-08 14:02:00,3494,"All of the above posts are right. That's why it's so hard to get agreement on that question. There are too many factors to be considered and everyone has different priorities. I generally have no idea who the best player is at any given moment, only who my favourite players are, and even that's hard to narrow down to even a few.  The other thing is that hockey's obviously a team game, or at least it's meant to be, and linemates have a lot to do with how good a player looks. That means there are a lot of influences coming to bear that are outside the control of the player in question - the coaching decisions, how well your linemates play on a given night, the line matchups you have to deal with, etc.  For sheer skill and entertainment I'd have to say Sidney's a pretty good choice, but for having all the tools the list is too long to start. But it's fun reading everyone else's thoughts on it.  Tonight my fave player may well be Andropov, or maybe Sundin, but I'll get a kick out of watching Boyd Devereaux. I know he won't make anyone's list but he has some hustle. Ya gotta love that in a mucker.  How about them Leafs, huh?  JF"
140713,Cookslav,2007-12-08 14:53:00,1457,"Well said John,  Gotta agree....Syd the Kids an obvious choice IMO. Beside possibly being the best ""active"" 2 way player, he's a competitor... He generaly hates to loose, and thats something a lot of these guys seemed to have lost. I can't stand complacency in a player.... When I was coaching, if I had a player who wasn't mad as heck about looseing....he wasn't playing much gaurenteed. I've seen from experience that guys who don't care, are a cancer to a teams moral.  (That and they always seem to be the same guys who turn out to be all attitude, and who's play falls off right off the map after they get that big salary increase...Brian Mc Cabe I'm looking in your direction)  Secondly, Syds a natural leader...he doesn't just yap, and muck it up, he walks the walk, and leads by exsample. A guy who can inspire his team mates will increase the entire teams play...thats a HUGE advantage.  And if you want to delve into the business, and sports well being aspect... He's a marketing gold mine! He's young so he'll be around for a while, and he's well spoken. But best of all he's a true sports idol for the kids...A clean, effective, well presented player, and a model the league would love to clone. Thats my thoughts....take it or  leave it"
140717,jnic,2007-12-08 15:43:00,158,sundin fight or  hit????????????????????????????????????????????
140718,shooter,2007-12-08 16:06:00,19,i think you have to look at each position individually...best all round forward i like IGINLA....best defenceman i like either NIK LIDSTROM or DION PHANEAUF......best goalie i like LECLAIRE from columbus blue jackets..just my opinion..
140719,dobee,2007-12-08 16:15:00,301,i remember watching devereaux playing for the kitchener rangers..knew he was going  to be good..  hes one of those players who you dont notice as much though... playing on the 3rd sometimes 4th line and all
140734,bassmaster4,2007-12-08 18:41:00,801,wade belak a few more minutes a game and we could be looking at a high scoring player
140735,misfish,2007-12-08 18:44:00,29133," Now that was just CRUEL.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,L M A O"
