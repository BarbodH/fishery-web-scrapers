140960,Kerry,2007-12-09 16:19:00,383,"Hey all, Just a heads up,as of this morning I found out Tromblys doesn't have any minnows and Hook and Bow in atherley isn't open so i can't tell if they have any at this time.Apparently Jacob is in the hospital from a heart attack.I'm not sure but that was what I was told. So if anyone is considering fishing up here in the next little while either call ahead or get them on the way. I haven't checked the one in Rama but will be by there today.A buddy is checking towards Kilworthy as they are supplied from someone up that way.  Kerry"
140963,Rob,2007-12-09 16:26:00,467,"Hey Kerry,  If Jacob is out of commish, then I would think that the others won't be far behind. As he supplies most of them with the bait  Rob"
141076,Kerry,2007-12-09 23:12:00,383,"Ok my buddy got his north of Orillia,can't remember the name but he is not supplied by Jacob's.Right now all they have is a river chub of some sort.I prefer shiners and they won't have any for a bit.I guess we're in a waiting pattern. We marked lots of bait in St John today but nothing biting.I didn't stop in Rama to check there. Sure is good to stand on hard water.BTW St John had 5"" of good clear ice and 2"" of crap on top with about 2"" of snow on that out from the airport side.  Kerry"
141207,misfish,2007-12-10 10:28:00,29133,"No fish in st.john.  Guess with the low supply,some will learn to use artificial."
141399,Kerry,2007-12-10 21:43:00,383,"Hey Brian, If that's the case buddy I'm in serious Ca  Ca cause other than mini tubes for perch.... and crappies IF I can find those guys I pretty much rely on tipped shiners.Keepin' my fingers crossed. Kerry"

141498,Gerritt,2007-12-11 02:21:00,6129,  I agree w/ Brian... there are no fish in St. John.... Sooo Brian when we going...??... I know a spot....  G

141535,misfish,2007-12-11 10:33:00,29133," I think a G2G was talked about, was it not? Maybe wait til the new year and see what gives. I got some of those berkley minnows in a tub from the BPS Open .I hear they catch fish.We will see."
