141163,floatfishin,2007-12-10 02:52:00,32,"Well, today was workin out to be a good day, not to much sleep after getting off work, but seemed to be a good day.  Well, then it turned out to be the worst day of my life in a matter of 3 phone calls....  I called my mom to say hi this eve, and my brother awnsered, I found it odd he would pick up the phone [:s]  I was then informed that my Mom's Best freind of 40+ yrs had past away [:^(]  I knew this woderfull woman from when I was born, She was an amazing lady in all ways!!! She had 2 great son's, and a beautiful daughter, and her husband ""Gaston"" was a man I still look up to. Beth succomed to Alzimers (Spelling?) and made her way to a better place, Bless her wonderfull soul.  So after about 2 hrs of tears (I'm home bymyself) I finally got to speak to my mother for some reason was out at my Uncle's place in Manotick. This I also found odd, for X-mas is around the corner and family would meet for sure then...  I tried mom's cell to no avail, so I called my uncle's home # and was greeted on the other end by a police officer........  Without detail, I spoke to my mother, and learned my beautiful cousin at only the age of 19 had her life taken away from her [:^(]  [:x]  Though I do not know anything of how it took place, I only 2 hrs before lost a woman I adored, but then to find out my beautiful cousin had also passed [:s]  Kelly was such a beautiful girl and had so many things going for her, she was off to college next yr(With Honours) and she was taken away from us way to soon. I as I write this still have tears on my face, I deserved to go, not her.  After loosing my Gramma just a few weeks back at the service, Kelly read a poem for Gramma, and now the family enduring this loss (Esp my lovley mom's for loosing her best friend) I hate to say it, but X-mas just aint going to be a celebration.  To Beth Hone  And  Kelly Pegg  You will always be in your families and friends heart and thoughts  I love you both and, will miss you more than I could say.  Float."
