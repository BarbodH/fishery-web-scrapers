141657,Headhunter,2007-12-11 18:49:00,5703,"Welcome to the board! I am an ex-Londoner... grew up smack in the middle between Greenway Park and Springbank Park. The mighty Thames has it's virtues and is an excellent way to cut our teeth fishin! Nice Thames Walter by the way! I've caught a few of them there in my day... the river should be back to normal next spring, when they complete the Springbank Dam project and get the river back up to normal levels in the spring and summer. Take lots of pics, I enjoy seeing my old stompin grounds! HH"

141006,shane,2007-12-09 19:39:00,652,"Hi everybody. Shane here from London. I've been hanging around different sites for a couple years but now that we got high-speed internet I'm really getting around.  But still always end up here somehow, so Ive decided to sign up.  I spend most of my fishing time wading around in the Thames looking for bass or carp.  I did get a nice surprise walleye this summer though. I'll try to put a picture in this post. It's also likely I met a couple of you guys already on the river around here. I'll have to get a hat.  So, thanks for having me, and I'll try to contribute something once in a while. (I'm still pretty new to this whole computer thing)  Oh yeah... just so you know where I stand on the major issues: --- I love the NF posts --- if I had a boat it would be a tiller --- they're called walleyes  see ya....................Fireball"

141505,shane,2007-12-11 02:45:00,652,"Thanks for the warm welcome everybody. Glad to be here.  Don't look for too many fishing reports from me for a while tho', I've pretty much given up on cold weather fishing these days. I used to go ice fishing when I was a kid in Manitoba and I still remember how bored I was. My Dad would drive the car right out on the lake to a little plywood shack. It had a sheet metal wood stove that would glow like a red light bulb it was so hot. And no underwater video to watch either. We would throw broken up egg shells down the hole and they would reflect light back up so we could see our baits or any fish that came in for a look. Hmm, now that I think of it, I think we were fishing for pickerel back then. That's weird.  Slow-poke; I'm on the east side of town off of Hamilton rd.  St. Julien park and the south branch of the Thames is at the end of my street.  Again, thanks everybody. See ya ..............Fireball"
