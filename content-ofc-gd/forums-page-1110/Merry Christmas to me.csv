141796,bowshep,2007-12-11 23:34:00,378,Maureen don't listen to the procrastinators of the world. You can do it... l had a training bike for 2 years and got on it again in sept went form 267lbs to 252 lbs since... all because of that bike... if it comes with a training guide then use it until you have your own routine... and don't worry about how big your muscles will get unless you have Russian  Farm Girl in your blood. Make sure that the cardiovascular workout happens too Biking or Cross country skiing...  If your going to work out stretch before and after your routine. Eat well and watch your Iron... Good Luck...  YOU CAN DO IT...  Peace Ken
