141840,Dano,2007-12-12 00:57:00,719, You guys got a fish?

141887,Rizzo,2007-12-12 03:50:00,4754,"the article claims you guys were doing some ""tag-teaming"" down in Picton.  If that's the case I'm glad I'm not a part of that motley crew"

141943,Terry,2007-12-12 12:55:00,14456,you should never tell who dun it...  I did it real quick but TJ looks real the clothes and the size seems to fit him
141967,Headhunter,2007-12-12 14:42:00,5703,Terry couldn't have been part of that shot... the fish does not resemble a Sheep head in any way! Bahhhh! HH
