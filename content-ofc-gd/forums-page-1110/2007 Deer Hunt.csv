142026,Carp,2007-12-12 19:41:00,1488,Excellent story Jen. Congrats on your first deer. That's a real beauty and an accomplishment you can be proud of. I know people who have hunted deer for 50 years and never shot such a magnificent buck.
142051,ChrisK,2007-12-12 20:56:00,2772,Good shootin Jen !!!! I bet your pumped up for next season already..........  WTG !!!!!
142055,cranks bait,2007-12-12 21:06:00,721,"Way to go Jen!!!  This year was my first year for hunting deer as well.  I however did not get anything.  I can almost relate to the feeling you had.  I was reluctant and wondered if I could do it.  I was a dogger for most of the hunt, which I enjoy more than sitting still for a couple of hours.   I figured I would be less likely to get a shot this way, but still enjoy the hunt.  It also allowed me to work off the food and booze from camp."
