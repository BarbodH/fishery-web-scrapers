141401,fishermccann,2007-12-10 21:49:00,655,Does anyone know of any fishhut operators that will be on the perch grounds  on LAKE SIMCOE this weekend?
141404,motv8tr,2007-12-10 21:54:00,2587,"I doubt it, drove over the narrows at Atherly today and there was lots of open water there, plus the temps have been above 0 I think which doesn't help the conditions any..I'm not sure but I would think you would need more than 3-4 inches for safe ice for the huts...I know you need more than a foot of it to get me to step on it  ..you're best to call them and find out for sure what the ice conditions are.  Maureen"
141406,Terry,2007-12-10 22:05:00,14456,I would say no way
141407,keram,2007-12-10 22:06:00,585,Do not even think about it.
141408,fishermccann,2007-12-10 22:07:00,655,"THe folks on Simcoe message board have been out since last Thurs .6"" of solid clear ice on the east side!"
141415,huntervasili,2007-12-10 22:19:00,1604,"yup, I have too heard of a solid few inches but not everywhere... Still unsafe conditions in most areas and I have yet to hear of any operators out there, my guess would be the weekend before Christmas if Ice continues to form and it doesn't deteriorate any... either way be safe out there, the lake is far from completely frozen"
141421,FishFinder,2007-12-10 22:21:00,481,"i went out this weekend, dont see why you couldnt have a hut out by next weekend, espcially with some colder temps by then."

141430,fishermccann,2007-12-10 22:27:00,655,Yes I know that they are out there I just need to know what operatos are going to let the rest of us in on it ?
141439,Guest gbfisher,2007-12-10 22:51:00,0,No operators will be out this coming weekend. There is a list at the site you referred to. It has the numbers to call.
141441,irishfield,2007-12-10 22:54:00,26272,This near zero and sun of today will actually help with the ice. Should knock the light snow cover down into the ice and get rid of the insulation layer.

141506,linweir,2007-12-11 02:47:00,202,Dave's Fishing Huts already put their perch huts out. Give Andrew a call at  905-722-5409

141594,Hookset,2007-12-11 15:24:00,367,"The day after my brother had his Vasectomy he said he wanted to take it easy and sit in my ice hut.  I told him I had moved the hut out from shore ""a ways"". Ever seen a guy ""shuffle"" through a foot of snow for half a click while whining about how his ""boys"" were killing him ? It snowed all day so the walk back was even funnier. I had to shuffle along and try to clear a path for him cuz' he couldn't pick his feet up anymore  He still hasn't forgiven me.   Hookset."
141635,bassjnkie,2007-12-11 17:24:00,1101,"I heard that Dave's has thier huts out. I will wait for 8""-10"" of ice before going out, personally.  Daniel OCH"
