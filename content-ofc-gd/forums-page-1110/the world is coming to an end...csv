141489,BFSC Kevin,2007-12-11 02:15:00,1351,"the leafs are leading 4-1, so if they win, that makes it 5 in a row wins?  ** i guess not! 4 in a row then broken by bruins on sat"
141491,Mike Pike,2007-12-11 02:17:00,1332,"I wish.  They lost Saturday against Boston.  So the World is not coming to an end.  Although, the Leafs ARE putting some wins together..."
141492,pidge,2007-12-11 02:18:00,438,"sorry to rain on your parade, but they lost Sat against Boston. Wishful thinking although"
141493,Cookslav,2007-12-11 02:18:00,1457,I thought they lost to Boston Saturday night? Thats what I was told but I didn;t actually see the game...
141495,Cookslav,2007-12-11 02:19:00,1457,wow....2 posts in the time it took me to type mine LOL!!! Hot Topic!
141500,BFSC Kevin,2007-12-11 02:24:00,1351,ahhhh.. my mistake.. living in the past.. so they had a 4 game win streak.. then broken by the bruins on sat.. opps...  who wouldve thought they would bounce back like this!
141503,BFSC Kevin,2007-12-11 02:33:00,1351,5-1
141519,Rizzo,2007-12-11 03:50:00,4754,Tampa looked HORRIBLE.  Their defensive coverage reminded me of how the Leafs often look.  You could see plays developing way in advance and the Tampa players gave zero effort
141530,KyleM,2007-12-11 05:57:00,218,For all you leaf fans.......    
141552,pigeonfisher,2007-12-11 12:45:00,696,"Also, they didn't beat Montreal."
141555,jediangler,2007-12-11 13:08:00,1923,"You're the man KyleM. And the world isn't coming to an end until December 21, 2012. So relax."
141641,JohnF,2007-12-11 17:34:00,3494," It looks like they put all their eggs in the offensive basket, which is kinda understandable with the front end they've got. Unfortunately for Tampa Richards went down for the count, LeCavalier just looked a little adrift out there and St.Louis was doing a lot of skating but not much attacking.  Once Toronto figgered out there was nobody on dee and nothing ressembling a Trap they had pretty open lanes to the net. Hard to believe TB can be so good in their own rink and suck so bad on the road. May just be some merit to the idea of trading Vinny for a top defenceman. It'll be a start anyway. Mebbe they'd like to trade for McCabe?????  JF"
141643,BFSC Kevin,2007-12-11 17:37:00,1351," I agree, do it, lecavlier for mccabe.. sounds fair.. no?"
141644,JohnF,2007-12-11 17:40:00,3494, Of course it is. But just to be fair I might be willing to throw in Kubina and a draft pick or two (if they're gonna still go with Ferguson as the picker).  JF
141645,BFSC Kevin,2007-12-11 17:44:00,1351,Ferguson?? he should get the boot.
141648,bbog,2007-12-11 18:03:00,665,Ferguson can stay if he pulls of a LeCavalier for McCabe deal!
141709,JohnF,2007-12-11 20:31:00,3494, It would certainly make a warm and fuzzy place fer him in my heart.  JF
141710,irishfield,2007-12-11 20:32:00,26272,Ferguson's Father should have never called in a favour and got Jr the job.
141767,JohnF,2007-12-11 22:30:00,3494," But take note, he didn't do it to Montreal.  JF"
