141554,Fish Farmer,2007-12-11 12:56:00,2234,Right on Chris! Plus your not draging the poop ( Guts )   through the meat
141557,Spiel,2007-12-11 13:15:00,9065,  ....Sheesh I hadn't even thought of that Farmer. Good point!
141600,solopaddler,2007-12-11 15:58:00,8605,"Have a Rapala electric but it never gets used. Only good for a huge mess of panfish, otherwise I've got no use for it. I'm faster and waste less meat when I do it the old fashioned way."
141722,Dabluz,2007-12-11 20:56:00,701,"Electric knives are gimmicks.  You never see a butcher use them.  I have been filleting fish since I was a little kid.  I much prefer using my old Rapalas that I keep razor sharp and I even remove the extra tiny bones from the walleye fillets.  There is not only the rib cage that has bones on trout and walleye.  There are tiny bones that stick out at about 90 degrees from the vertebrae.  They are very evident on large salmon.  Most chefs pull those very small bones with large tweezers after the fillet has been cut off the fish.  Most of the work I do is with the tip of my fillet knife.  I feel for the bones with the tip so most of my fillet work is with a very short fillet knife.  The only time a long fillet knife is used is when I remove the skin from a very large fillet.  My filleting technique is quite unique.  I do not start on the back of the fish.  I start out by gutting the fish (I do not want the fish's innards contaminating my filets), removing the lower fins and cutting off the head with a stout knife.  My first 2 cuts with the fillet knife are from each side of the anus in order to leave the anal fin attached to the vertebrae.  I then slip the point of the fillet knife from one of those 2 cuts and push the blade until it exits the dorsal part of the fish.  The knife is angled towards the dorsal fin.  I can feel the tip of the blade bump up against the vertebrae when it is travelling towards the dorsal part of the fish.  When the tip of the blade extends past the back, I just cut back towards the tail.  I do this on the other side of the fish.  Now with the fish on it's back (actually it's on it's side but I want to stress that I start at the underside of the fish), I slip the point of the knife under the rib cage.  I can see the blade of the knife through the rib cage as the tip of the knife is moving towards the head of the fish.  I disengage the rib cage from the fillet.  Now, I use the fillet knife on the dorsal part of the fish by continuing the dorsal cut through the skin on either side of the dorsal fin all the way to the head.  Then it is a simple procedure to cut down to the short bones that stick out 90 degrees from the vertebrae, slip the knife over the bones and back towards the vertebrae and to where the rib cage is attached to the vertebrae.  I now have 2 complete fillets and absolutely no meat on the carcass of the fish.  I hate to waste any meat.  An electric knife would not allow me such finesse.  I guess an electric knife would be great at just cutting off the head of the fish.  But, most of my filleting is done before I leave my fishing spot to go home or at my campsite.  I would have to buy a generator...lol.  I then remove the cheeks on the walleyes and pike.  I don't think an electric knife can accomplish this job.  Anybody who has to buy an electric knife is mostly due to the fact that he doesn't keep his knives sharp enough.  The 6 inch blade on my large 40 year old Rapala filleting knife is now too narrow from so much sharpening.  This has changed the angle of the cutting edge and is now difficult to sharpen with my sharpening stones.  I will have to take it to a butcher shop to make the blade thinner on their belt sharpener.  There are much better fillet knives than the Rapala and they cost about the same or just a bit more, depending on the quality.  Next year, I will put that on my Christmas list."
141724,misfish,2007-12-11 20:58:00,29133,Thats a great post. Thank you for sharing.
141727,Terry,2007-12-11 21:06:00,14456,"Electric knives are gimmicks...I  disagree  like you said, you have been doing it for years..so sure it's a piece of cake..for you  for those that only cut up fish a couple of times a year an electric knife makes the job much easier, quicker  they may be a crutch, but not a gimmick"
141737,irishfield,2007-12-11 21:16:00,26272,I grew up in a butcher shop... I've still rolled over and use an electric carving knife for Turkey/Chicken and roasts ! Haven't tried one on fish YET.
141740,misfish,2007-12-11 21:20:00,29133,Thier a gimmick.
141744,Terry,2007-12-11 21:27:00,14456,yeah but you guys from the island are born with a fillet knife in one had and a rod in the other
141746,irishfield,2007-12-11 21:28:00,26272,Protectin themselves at the brothel eh !
141754,misfish,2007-12-11 21:42:00,29133, Now you know why the wimen are so tough.
141760,drwxr,2007-12-11 22:07:00,453,"special at lebaron   gimmick or no, you have to know how to use it  http://youtube.com/watch?v=bcWyGrV0qao"
141835,Mike the Pike,2007-12-12 00:49:00,3421,Well I don't mind cleaning the bigger fish like Walleye but I am too tired of cleaning a wack fo perch .So I hinted to my parents what I want the Rapala Deluxe set half price this week at Canadian tire.If I don't like it I can always carve the turkey with it.  
141125,kickingfrog,2007-12-10 01:31:00,8333,Thinking of a Christmas gift. Are the electric fillet knifes more gimmick than substance?
141135,icefisherman,2007-12-10 01:47:00,952,"No gimmik at all. I've used mine for the past 3 years and have filleted countless fish with it...makes your job much easier and cleaner. Mine comes with AC/DC power and two blades....got it on sale at CT for less then $40 for the whole set. Will be perfect Christmas gift.  Cheers, Ice Fisherman"
141137,Landlocked,2007-12-10 01:50:00,171,Canadian Tire has the Rapala on sale this week....you will be a believer in them if you watch someone who knows what they're doing with them..downright amazing.
141145,Dondorfish,2007-12-10 02:17:00,1000,i have a brand new one - just waiting for a feed of simcoe perch to give it a go! i've seen them used - you won't be disappointed once you get the hang of it!   Don
141148,Guest gbfisher,2007-12-10 02:28:00,0,kickass   just finished filleting a good feed of Crappy and a good feed of perch the other day. Great gift and No gimmic! Good for carving Roasts as well.
141150,young_one,2007-12-10 02:33:00,620,highly recommand! Remember to wash them throughly after each use.
141261,oldphart,2007-12-10 14:33:00,665,"~~~I got the Storms, and after a long day phishen it make short work at filletting them"
141265,tonyb,2007-12-10 15:20:00,1637,"Once you go electric, you'll wonder what took you so long to switch...they make cleaning fish much less of a chore, especially panfish!  Tony"
141266,Landlocked,2007-12-10 15:24:00,171,Heard the Piranha from Mister Twister is a very good model.
141270,duber,2007-12-10 15:34:00,220,I have the rapala that ct sells and it is great.Hard to go back to a plain knife now.
141273,Tomcat,2007-12-10 15:55:00,395,"I've been using a Rapala ProGuide Deluxe Electric Fillet Knife Set for 2 years. These electric filleting knives facilitate cleaning fish quickly. Last summer, after a great morning of walleye fishing for 4 of us, I cleaned 24 walleye. Glad I wasn't limited to using a blade. And on that particular occasion, I was powering my Rapala ProGuide with a 12 volt battery.  Great gift regardless the occasion. Here's a web reference to a site that has a video demonstrating cleaning a northern with an electric filleting knife - see http://www.why-fish.com/"
141317,kickingfrog,2007-12-10 18:41:00,8333,"Wow! All positive, do you guys get a kickback? I guess I'll get one for my brother, he cleans all my fish anyway  If it doesn't work I'm comin' for everyone of ya.  Thanks"
141321,kickingfrog,2007-12-10 18:42:00,8333,  My wife feels the same way. lol
141329,taper,2007-12-10 19:03:00,611,"It's hard to find, I had to get my local tackle shop to order it for me but Rapala makes an electric rechargable. It is great comes with two batteries charger case 6 inch and 8 inch blades. Not cheap around $110 if I remember correctly but works awesome when you head North away from the modern convenience of electricity. Also I find it a bit heavier but not having the cord dangle in your way makes up for it."
141378,tonyb,2007-12-10 20:47:00,1637,Man I am slow today...read that a couple times before catching it
141379,huntervasili,2007-12-10 20:47:00,1604,I have one and its great after a long day fishing... Especially if you are keeping perch and other panfish...
141381,misfish,2007-12-10 21:01:00,29133,"I dont know about the rest of you,s,but I still have my original Rapala from 25 years ago (chewed handle from my old lab pup. Dont ask),my pop has one even older. I was taught (by my pop) to do it the old fashion way, and I really enjoy filleting my catch.  This is almost as bad as the new Monopily (sp?) game that uses a debit card now to buy/sell.  Whats this world coming too??????????????????????????????  Guess it,s just me, I  like to keep the tradition alive."
141385,kickingfrog,2007-12-10 21:18:00,8333,"I'm with you Misfish. I have the/a original rapala model with the birch handle that was my dads and a smaller one (4 inch blade maybe) that was my grandfather's ""grouse"" knife. We'll see how my brother likes it, as I said I don't clean too many big messes of fish anymore (that's what little brothers are for right?), so I don't think it's of much use to me anyway."
141392,PERCHER,2007-12-10 21:29:00,787,Eelectric is the only way to go.Make sure you get one that will also plug into the wall outlet.All the brands seem to be very good .So look touch feel and you will know whats the right one for you.
141394,kickingfrog,2007-12-10 21:32:00,8333,"  Thats what my wife said, but she doesn't clean fish????"
141398,tonyb,2007-12-10 21:42:00,1637,Again!
141475,Garyv,2007-12-11 01:09:00,547,"Had mine for years and wouldn't want to be without it, especially when cleaning big Salmon etc."
141478,Rich,2007-12-11 01:19:00,3927,"Good for big fish, I prefer a knife for perch and such. Electric knife will waste a lot of meat. Also, don't try filleting a carp with one.. lol"
141480,crappieperchhunter,2007-12-11 01:36:00,2582,"My brother swears by his electric.  Myself I just enjoy getting out the wooden handled rapala and doing it manually. Get home, get organised, pour a coffee or a coffee and bailey's and sit down and relax and clean fish.  But that's just me.  Prefer a standard car to an automatic as well. Any my house will NEVER have a dishwasher...cept for the wife or myself.  Keep it simple."
141549,Spiel,2007-12-11 12:16:00,9065,"....Electric, never. Give me a good sharp fillet knife anytime. I don't mess with cutting off the rib cage then having to go back to remove it. A good knife lets me work around the ribs leaving them on the fish. A couple of quick slices and a some what duller knife for skinning and Bobs your Uncle."
