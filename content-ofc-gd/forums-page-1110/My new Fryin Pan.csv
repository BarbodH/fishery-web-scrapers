141801,GNODDY,2007-12-12 00:01:00,163,"Well I put a deposit on this bad boy today. I'm pumped it has a live well, storage, bilge its the same size as my old tinny but now I have floors and can also attach a trolling motor alot easier on the bow. I am freakin excited I have a 15 SS which I am hoping will push it enough to get it on plane but we'll see. If not I guess I'll have to look at a 20 HP.          Cheers  Geoff"
141802,irishfield,2007-12-12 00:04:00,26272,Great stuff Gnoddy !!! A planner mast.. a couple down riggers and you can follow Lloyd around as well ! LOL
141806,GNODDY,2007-12-12 00:13:00,163,Already thinkin the same thing Wayne. The only thing I'd be worried about is that wind once in a while at Picton

141822,Greencoachdog,2007-12-12 00:32:00,8163,Looks like a fish catchin' machine to me!
141825,JustinHoffman,2007-12-12 00:34:00,482,"Hey Gnoddy,  Great looking boat!! I have the same vessel, although mine will be celebrating it's 20th birthday next season!!   (still can't believe it's been that long..) Although they were called a Springbok back then, they are identical in layout and design.  Have put mine through a tonne of abuse over the years, and she still works great. I run a 20HP, and would probably suggest you do the same on yours.  As you can see from these photos, I ""pimped"" out the ride over the years. Built a front casting deck, and made the deck portion behind it (which once held another seat) a storage space. Also converted the side storage space to an additional livewell, as I used to fish tournaments with this back in the day. Added a bow-mount, electronics, bilge...and she was good to go.  Other than the lighter shade of blue carpet, all of the rest is the original. (goes to show you that cleaning your boat regularly and always using a cover when not in use really extends the life of your vessel and it's components.)  Enjoy the new ride - I still am 20 years later!!          Good Fishing,  Justin"
141826,Dondorfish,2007-12-12 00:34:00,1000,Very Nice!  I had a Springbok once that had a similar layout - very comfy to fish from. Good luck with your new purchase.   Don
141828,Mike the Pike,2007-12-12 00:35:00,3421,Nice ride Bud I think you will be fine on Picton Bay .Just get off the water when the wind picks up.  Wow thats one big ass fishfinder.
141837,GNODDY,2007-12-12 00:52:00,163,Ya that finder is probably as old as I am.  to JustinHoffman I think eventually I am going to run a 20 but for now i've got a 15 johnson in the basement with electric start if she won't get up on plane fast enough I'll try one of those hydrofoils and hopefully that works. It was tough enough for me to convince the wife to let me sell my old tinny in order to buy another one of the same size.
141839,JustinHoffman,2007-12-12 00:57:00,482,"Gnoddy,  The 15 should be fine with just one person. Two people and equipment - it might struggle to get down on plane...  She's a fine boat, with whatever you run it with..  Good Fishing, Justin"
141841,Dano,2007-12-12 01:00:00,719,"Well done, that looks like a fine ride."
