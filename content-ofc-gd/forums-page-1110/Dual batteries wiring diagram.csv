141701,Dabluz,2007-12-11 20:23:00,701,"No matter what setup you have, you can never recharge a deep cycle trolling motor battery by using any kind of set up in a boat.  If your charger gives you 6 amps for 1 hour, that means 6 amp/hour.  That's enough energy to run a trolling motor that uses about that much amperage for 1 hour.....meaning a small 10 lb thrust motor at half speed.  Way to little to move a large boat fast enough to troll.  A large electric motor uses about 15 to 30 amps per hour on the average to move a 17 foot boat.  A 6 amp/hour battery charger is ok for topping up a starter battery if the motor runs for a good 30 minutes or more.....just like an automobile.  I would just forget about trying to charge the trolling motor battery at all.  It's a no win situation.  A trolling motor battery with 200 minutes of reserve capacity will make a 50 lb thrust electric motor work for about 4 hours.  When you get home, it will take about 20 hours to completely recharge the trolling motor battery with a 6 to 10 amp battery charger."
141707,irishfield,2007-12-11 20:29:00,26272,"Good advise Dabluz... and why I told him to put starting batteries in there, to do what they're designed for."
141734,icefisherman,2007-12-11 21:12:00,952,"Guys,  someone has said truth is born in arguments. So I do appreciate your arguments/discussion as it helps me a lot to understand this issue. Brian thanks for the drawing. I'll save it for future reference.  Here is what I just got emailed back to me from Yamaha tech support:  Good afternoon:  Hope this helps:  Alternator output 4 Amps @ 1500rpm 10 amps @ 2400rpm 13 amps @ 4500rpm  I've asked them about my kicker and this is their reply. It should answer some of your questions from the past few days about Amps at certain RPM.  Dabluz,  I'd rarely use the electric trolling motor. So depleting the second batter (kicker connected to it because of extensive use of electric trolling motor is non issue for me). The issue though is this....I am planning to connect to the same battery two electric riggers (Cannon MAG10 probably), so will the kicker be able to keep up with the use those two rigger will drain out of the battery during say....8 Hrs trolling? Using the numbers Yamaha gave me above, someone with electrical knowledge should be able to calculate what two riggers draw and what the kicker will be able to produce/charge at the same time?  I know the ideal world may call for two starter batteries and two trolling batteries but I don't think I'll be so ideal in this case...don't like the extra weight/space I'll lose nor do I like to pay extra $200-$300 if I could avoid it by utilizing the two almost new deep cycle batteries I have on board right now.  Cheers, Ice Fisherman"
141735,keram,2007-12-11 21:12:00,585,"  So, just out of curiosity,  how you call it ?"
141749,Dabluz,2007-12-11 21:33:00,701,It's a magneto.

141391,keram,2007-12-10 21:28:00,585," I hope   I start to understand what you are talking about. You are right that ""alternator does not has to has housing. The magnets can be embeded in the engine itself ( stator), but the rotor  must has bearing or bushings. It rotates  all the time when motor is running   This comment suggest that you have older motor ( I do not know ), and as such you do not have alternator, instead you have DC generator, as the name says it generates DC current ( but still has to be regulated), you do not want to charge your battery with 13V at idle and 50V at WOT) I hope.  This was a technology in 1960 - 1970 ( +/- few years  )  On other post you've said   Any outbord with battery charging capabilities must have alternator and there is no if's, but's and or's here.  I think we slide little bit from an original question."
141457,SlowPoke,2007-12-10 23:39:00,2984, We'll agree to disagree. Next year we can discuss it further while fishing from my boat that does not have an alternator or a regulator! -Brian
141528,JPD,2007-12-11 05:26:00,296,Only the newer style higher horsepower motors and some four strokes have actual automotive style alternators. The rest have the stator and rectifier which charge while the fly wheel rotates around the coils with magnets attached to the fly wheel. (which is still a type of alternator but not automotive style that is belt driven)  Most of the newer motors are changing over however.  JP
141653,Tybo,2007-12-11 18:24:00,1373,"Most, regular 2 stroke still use the stator system. For their is no need for large amperage. Just spark and charging.  If it's a EFI you need more power to keep the fuel rail open."
141696,SlowPoke,2007-12-11 20:09:00,2984,"Okay, it took a little while to find this for Emil's motor.... No bearing, no bushings, no alternator... The reason for my persistance is not so much to prove I'm right but because Emil had asked me through email about where to find the alternator... everyone keeps talking about an alternator. There is no dang alternator! LOL!!!  "
140871,icefisherman,2007-12-09 04:22:00,952,"  I think we are getting there...together...that is until Wayne dumps another picture on me now ha ha ha  Can't tell you how much I appreciate your input guys! Keram, would you agree that my kicker is not a ""regular kicker""....been HIGHT THRUST kicker must mean something...i.e. running at higher RPMs than a normal kicker and been thrust model also having higher amperage output at lower RPMs because theese motors are designed to be kicker motors?
