In one of the stores he picks up a mirror and looks in it. Not ever having seen one before, he remarked at the image staring back at him, ""How about that! Here's a picture of my daddy.""  He bought the mirror thinking it was a picture of his daddy, but on the way home he remembered his wife didn't like his father. So he hung it in the barn, and every morning before leaving for the fields, he would go there and look at it. His wife began to get suspicious of these many trips to the barn. One day after her husband left, she searched the barn and found the mirror. As she looked into the glass, she fumed, ""So that's the ugly carp he's runnin' around with.""   Art"
