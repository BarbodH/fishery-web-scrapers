Then I did a double take, on the north side of the bay are 4-5 huts!!!   Is it just me or are some people rushing things a bit???  The next couple of days are calling for snow and warmer temps... Weather forcast  I wonder how long they'll last out there?  Maureen"

There's a ""calm"" section between Hindson Marine and the S turn on Champlain that is shallow and is generally pretty safe IF YOU KNOW where you are going !  Noticed Midland Harbour has some WET pressure cracks in her this morning. Just when I was giving thought to a big hole and some vertical jigging with a Fuzzy Duzzit ! LOL  Also, for those going North thinking COLD = more ice. I just got a report that there is only 1 to 3 inches of ice on Lake Temagami in the bay right by Hwy #11... thanks to all the snow they've been getting. The cold isn't making any ice."
