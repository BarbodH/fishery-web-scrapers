It has been a while since I've been on the site but I can say that I like the Christmas theme for the site, so do my kids.  I know that the fishing season is pretty much over for our family, or is it? I'm not sure if we are still able to fish, my concern is for my kids. I know that my son wants to try ice fishing but it is still to early for that.  What I was wondering is does anyone here know if you can rent or does someone here rent out ice huts and where?  And how much do they rent for?  I read that Cliff had mentioned about a fish for Taylor thing and was wondering if it was going to happen again. Or if maybe there was something else like that where everyone could all get out together?  I just thought that I would ask because the ice fishing season is pretty much here. I have never done it and like I said my kids want to try it, so I would like to make a family outing of it. Any help would be appreciated.  Happy Holidays to all."
