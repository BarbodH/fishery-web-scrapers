141471,Mike Pike,2007-12-11 00:51:00,1332,"Terrific find, Lunkerbasshunter.  Thanks for that.  Cogeco subscribers in Hamilton don't get WFN so this will keep me entertain for quite a while!!!  Thank you."
141510,Beats,2007-12-11 03:10:00,543,"I remember thinking a few years ago how great it would be if fishing shows were viewable online for all to see.  It was really cool when Bob Izumi started putting his episodes online at www.realfishing.com a year or so ago.  More are added every so often and it makes it so easy to re-watch favorite episodes.  The site linked above  appears to be a huge resource of different shows, many of which I've never heard of or seen.  I'll check it out in the near future for sure."
