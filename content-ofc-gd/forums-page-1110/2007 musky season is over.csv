142023,Carp,2007-12-12 19:31:00,1488,"Sounds like a very good year Lew. I'd take a fraction of that and be extremely happy. Good job.  Hey, I know the sweety in the last pic. Definitely the best of the them."

141074,Guest gbfisher,2007-12-09 23:10:00,0,Nice Lew. It was a good season. Sorry I couldnt put you on any fish. Maybe next year.  Ive been out on the ice twice so far. Good feed of Perch and a great feed of Crappy from this morning.  
141077,Whopper,2007-12-09 23:12:00,2174,Well done Lew!  Thanks for the recap! Glad you had a good year except for the loss of Ed.  Good Luck in 08
141082,mattyk,2007-12-09 23:27:00,2110,great recap of the season Lew. I always look forward to hearing your reports! Thanks for taking the time to share with us!
141222,lew,2007-12-10 12:20:00,12767,"Thanks everyone     Roger & Pete, you boys have added a few extra bonus points with Diane for the next time your up at the lake next summer    Forgot to mention that we were also checked very closely by a helicopter too Roger, not long after the boat check.  We saw the chopper flying up along the Grand Island shoreline , then when he spotted us he made a 90 degree turn and came right over to us where he slowed down and basically hovered,  not too high, right above us, while he had a good look at us, then contined back on his original course.  I've seen them before, but that's the 1st time they've come over for a close look. We were well inside the Canadian side too, but he was just curious I spose......no problems with that at all either."
141232,Squid,2007-12-10 13:17:00,1656,Yorshire pudding yummy!
141765,Smokey,2007-12-11 22:21:00,1278,Great re-cap of the season Lew. Too bad no fish on the the Niagara but some day that one you hit will be a monster and make it all worth the past few years effort. Hopefully next year we'll hit the water again and see what kind of weather we can dig up for the trip as we seemed to have hit it all on the last few trips. One of these times where going to hit it just right.  Enjoy the off season  Mike
141779,Joey,2007-12-11 22:55:00,9122,"I'm so bummed we missed the Upper Niagara fish with you two this year.  It just wasn't in the cards for us last weekend.  I'm glad you guys had a good time, fish or not.  We'll definately be up for it next year and I guess I'll have to show you where the girls are hiding  Nice recap Lew, outstanding in my books.  Joey"
141789,fatherof3,2007-12-11 23:18:00,1769,nice recap and congrats on what sounds like a good fishing season
