140893,floatfishin,2007-12-09 07:00:00,32,"Well, after thinkin I was not workin tonight, I got called in for a few hrs. when I got home, I thought I'd re-cap like RV, and share my yr [=D>]  Well... I certainly had a slow yr by many standards, but I'll try to tear a quick bit off...  My Ice season............ Bahhhhh [LOL] Lookin for the pic's, but to make it easy, Rob whooped me ars, he took me to school on the ice in 07 []  After that, it was a slow start to hit open water, I guess I'll just add ""Opener"" pics, for I don't think I caught fish in 07 till then [LOL]  (Opener for Chrome 2007, Myself, RE_TIE, and Steelheader)  A loner shot...   The double on one # 12 hook    The piggy of opener, Jay (Steelheader) can fill in the blanks [LOL]    Couple more...    Jay in battle..    And my FAV pic hands down, me AND tHA tie, LOVE THIS SHOT!!!    Some after opener pics...      After that it was slow....  Low and behold after a long stint of slow fishin, a certain buddy calls me and ask's if I might be able to head up North [:s] Well Bunker made the call and I was there to receive it, I got to spend a week with my bro, on heaven's water indeed!!!! A trip that, was simply amazing!!!!!!             Then low and behold... Scottydog comes up for a visit in the Ottawa region!!!!  Well... A few beers [LOL]  and we got to head out with Pay (Magnet) for a pair of unforgetalbe days on the Mighty Ottawa River!!!            After all of that, I was off to Niagra Region wqith ma bro Scottydog!!!  Got into some beers [LOL] An outing on ""Fishmasters's"" Boat for me 1st Lake Erie Eye adventure, Pic's are somewhere...  And again to the ""444"" With Boston and Scotty, we managed to make a good run!!! 11th out of 30 some odd!!!    Thx again guy's, what a wicked time!!!   Followed by RE_TIE up for an Ottawa visit, no boat in tow, but we hit the shore trash thing!!!!        A few trips in-between, and nothin much my way to show pic wise, but I did happen to snap my fav pic of my lil one (Valerie) takin charge of the river [=D>]  [=D>]    Also, on the same moment, I got RE-TIE's lil guy in a shot too:    To end it all, I happened to see a post from a bro that might need a fishin partner, and low and behold it was........  Moosebunk!!!!!  The best trip I could have ever taken, and it happened!!!!               Amazin Year!!!!   F.F"
