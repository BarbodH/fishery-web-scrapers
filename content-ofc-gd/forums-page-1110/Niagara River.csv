Every drift u have a fish on double headers triple headers just crazy in one day 3 guys boated over 50 fish. the weather has cooperated for us and so has the mighty Niagara. Every thing seems to work right now roe, streamers, minnows, gulp minnows, single egg imitation. Cant complain, just thought i would share some porn with yas. This isnt even nearly a quarter of the fish i got just these are the better quality pics.  Just click the picture.  "

141672,lovetofish,2007-12-11 19:32:00,500,nice fish
141676,Grimace,2007-12-11 19:42:00,2020,Excellent
141756,Hellfish,2007-12-11 21:50:00,308,thnx for the comments. Joey your right to a extent im sure they do smell it in the mud no doubt about that but usually it is a reaction bite. Weve been out in 3-6 inch vis and landed 20 fish in the boat. Right now they are laying some traps with lakers in them leaving them for 21 days and going to test the lakers to see the level of contaniments.

If you go back this week please keep us posted on the fishing conditions"
