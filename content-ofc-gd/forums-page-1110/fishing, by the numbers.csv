142032,Cookslav,2007-12-12 20:08:00,1457,Interesting for sure.... Not sure I could make any deductions from it other then the number of anglers is decreaseing significantly year on year = more fish fer me! And Trout were officialy made the number 2 catch second to walleye for the first time ever.  That and we in Ontario Keep 22.2% of what we catch.  You could wrap your mind around these statistics for weeks LOL...if your bored and inclinded to crunch numbers for fun like me LOL!
