142019,Headhunter,2007-12-12 19:24:00,5703,"I'm trying to source a toboggan for my kids for Xmas... we have a great hill near our house and I'd like to get the family a toboggan. I've been to CTC and they only have wooden ones and frankly, they are extremely flimsy. Ideally, I think I'd like an aluminum one, if they still make them  ? Anyone have any recommendations? Appreciate your help! HH"
142021,irishfield,2007-12-12 19:29:00,26272,You want steering on it... let me head back to the shop and start cutting !  Seriously.. haven't seen a alum in a long time. It's the world of plastic out there unfortunately (not that I'm complainin    )!  Gotta be one available somewhere though... did you do a search for aluminum tobbogan on Google?  I will say a wood one will outlast an aluminum one though... from what I saw through my child hood. Heck.. I've still got my sisters wooden toboggan and what I was using last year at the Tyler ice fishing event to haul my gear.
142024,ccmtcanada,2007-12-12 19:32:00,7971,I checked kijiji.ca and craigslist.org for the Toronto area and no aluminum ones listed at all!  I remember growing up...we had one...it was much better than woods ones that you had to wax all the time.  I'll keep an eye out Joe....good luck!
142027,Headhunter,2007-12-12 19:53:00,5703,"Thanks guys... yah  Wayne, I googled and came up dry. I'd consider a plastic one, if it was family size, but so far, most of what I've come across are designed for individuals, not multiple riders. Thanks again for your efforts... Wayne, wanna cut a wing off one of the planes? HH"

142035,Landlocked,2007-12-12 20:13:00,171,"We looked last year for the same thing but the young guy at CT talked us into getting the largest GT snow racer....and he was right.  I can fit on it with my three yr. old and my wife can fit on it with both the 3yr. old and 1yr. old.    Now our oldest loves to go on his own and has fun steering it down the hill.  I'm 34yrs old and the kid at CT couldn't believe we were asking for a tobaggan...told him it's a ""retro thing"""
142037,cranks bait,2007-12-12 20:15:00,721,"I just checked with our good old fashioned hardware store here, and they had them last year.  They are going out of business so they will not order more in.  I would say try a hardware store.  Not a box store but, one that has been around forever and has everything under then sun, that no one else can get.  I'm gonna miss the one here, because they were my goto guys."
142038,misfish,2007-12-12 20:16:00,29133," Thats too funny Brian.LOL   I remember  doing the stand up and hang,n onto the rope and jump,n the the ramps we made with the aluminums..Never catch me do,n that now. Stupid kids.LOL"
142039,Headhunter,2007-12-12 20:18:00,5703,"Thanks folks! Great ideas here, appreciate you input... based on what I've read here... I'll go rivets! HH"
142049,Kirk,2007-12-12 20:45:00,347,"ctc has long plastic ones, I can sit with the little guy for toboganning and its handy on ice fishing trips, look at more than just one ctc and you might be happy"
142053,huntervasili,2007-12-12 20:58:00,1604,I haven't seen any of the alum ones before but I betcha a 10ft tinny would do the job lol
142054,misfish,2007-12-12 21:01:00,29133," LOL Bill I,ll bet one of Waynes floaters would do the trick too.LOL"
142056,cranks bait,2007-12-12 21:08:00,721,"Ironically every time I read from this thread an add appaers at the top for custom made sleds, home made sleds etc."
142063,irishfield,2007-12-12 21:23:00,26272, Defiitely riveted... I could get the TIG torch out to hand autograph it though Joe. What's your wife's name again... LOL
