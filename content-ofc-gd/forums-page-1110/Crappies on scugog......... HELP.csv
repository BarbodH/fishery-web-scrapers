Without being too specific ,and giving away a Honey Hole of your own, what general areas of the Lake should I be looking in and how should I be fishing them ie bait and lures? If anyone has any tips I'd appreciate. Tight lines !!"
141930,Dondorfish,2007-12-12 11:26:00,1000,I fish the edge of the channel in front of Goreskis and get them almost every trip. I have caught them on a jigging rod as well as on the tipup with a minnow.   Don

You can also use a jighead and put a minnow on a hook like it was mentioned in the early idiott. As well try worms if you can find them anywhere that might work. Float couple of split shots and a hook and a worm, thats how i fished when i was a kid lol but it works"
