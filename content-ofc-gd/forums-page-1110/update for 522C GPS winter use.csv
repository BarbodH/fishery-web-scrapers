141723,Tom McCutcheon,2007-12-11 20:58:00,627,Just hung up the phone with the Tech guys at Lowrance. They agreed with many others on the forum and stated it was alright to use the unit in the winter so long as it was NOT left out for an extended period of time (overnight) in extreme cold. The unit may react slowly in those conditions but so long as you are aware of this it should be no problem. There is even a cigarette lighter  adapter power cord with 3 amp fuse which can be purchased for a quick connection to the ATV. I still think I will enclose the unit in some sort of box to try and keep the wind chill to a minimum while running across the snow and ice.  Thanks again for the responses.  Tightlines all and be safe out there.  Tom.

141764,ccmtcanada,2007-12-11 22:19:00,7971,Yep..what Wayne said...windchill is the effect the wind has on how it FEELS to us.  I wouldn't waste your time with the box.  It would however prevent water from freezing on the unit when you are moving around like that.  Great info in your post...good luck out there!
