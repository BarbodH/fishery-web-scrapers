Awesome guys, but of course there are always the language issues..  Quick tip if you want to speak to someone english, press #2 for french, you'll get someone in Quebec that speaks both."

377058,carp-starter,2009-08-27 11:07:00,253,"This is a good thread. It is too bad that I am one who does not appreciated jokes. Except for about 2 of them, I find them silly.  I am a poor, humble immigrant. This of course means that I was not born in Canada.  Dara, yes you may laugh – you stated “We're not supposed to laugh at that are we!”  I do not mind “immigrant” jokes or whatever else. But I do not hear many of them.  I have spoken to a few “Mujibar”. It was more frustrating than funny in my case.  When I read this thread, I laughed when I read the post by jughead.  He stated –  “People with accents from other countries aren't as smart as us because they pronounce words differently.”  Allow me to state that I have an accent. One reason is because I am from another country. But, I think it is because that at one time I spoke 6 languages. Two languages I forgot.  So, I can speak only 4 and 3 of them are spoken poorly. There is a reason why I forgot 3 of them. In 1981 I came to live in the GTA because of a bank transfer. I have not been lucky enough to find people who spoke in those languages. Here in Ontario, let us face facts; many who were born here in Ontario cannot even form a proper sentence. Forget about learning another language if one is born in Ontario. Now, how many can speak French?  But my accent is probably because of the 6 languages I spoke. Make that 7 languages – American (before 1981 I used to go down to the States every week-end.)  If I am from another country and I pronounce words differently, why does it mean that I am not “as smart as us”. It is very possible that I am not smart.  I have a university degree in Math. I then went to graduate school on a scholarship – Math, of course. But I still have my accent.  Do I feel insulted – NO. I am not the one who has the problems.  Jughead, who is “us?” Could it be the K.K.K.? You talk in terms of “us” and ‘they”. Are these opposing enemy groups? And do not forget that even in the States, you accent is very different.  I pity the poor immigrant who after many years living in Ontario and finally was beginning to feel that he is now in the “us” group until he reads this thread and finds out that he is still back in the “they” group.  Pikehunter, I am sorry for posting the above but I felt I had to reply to the jughead post and point out some things.  carp-starter"

377217,gdelongchamp,2009-08-27 20:57:00,199,"Pikehunter, thank you for your joke. Yes it was funny.  Carp-starter, thank you for your insight. It's comments like yours that help us all keep in check.  We as Canadians can go off on a lot of tangents regarding those who have come from various other countries. On the other hand I am sure this kind of thing goes on everywhere in the world. But it is always best that the realities of these situatiations surface immediately so that things don't get out of control.  Now, I think I'll go have that other beer."
377226,pikehunter,2009-08-27 21:27:00,1659,"We, the people of the world have to lighten up and look at our differences with humour, without it this would be a hell of a cold rock to live on.  After I posted this I realized that a couple of feathers might possibly get ruffled but if some did get a little messed up then you are due an apology and I'm sorry your skin is so thin. There is nothing wrong with accents, other cultures, other foods it all helps to keep the world interesting. I just like to see the funny side of it all.  Does anyone know where the State farm Insurance emergency call centre is? Texas! Now try to converse in ordinary ""Canadian English"" with a Texan! Oh crap, I just put my foot in my mouth again!"

If you are in north america, and call the customer service of an international business company, the chances of you speaking to someone in north america is pretty low. Most of these jobs are bveing outsourced to India and other parts of Asia. The joke is funny because..well..it's true...all these customer service people have English as a second language so it's not going to be perfect... and well..it can be frustrating getting by the accent when you have at technical problem..like I had with my Linksys wireless modem..and my service agent was in the Phillipines!"
