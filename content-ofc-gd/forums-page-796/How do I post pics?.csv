I have a new laptop and I am importing my pics from my memory card. They are stored in my documents under my pics but from there I am not sure how to resize them and post them to the board. I checked the help section but couldn't find the answer there either. Please help so I can post the pics of my new boat that I promised MOTIV8R. Thanks, Ry P.S. It has been so long since I posted a pic I can't even remember how I posted my member pic!!!"
