376693,pikehunter,2009-08-26 10:35:00,1659,"Just like all the other bands making a comeback, their making more $$$$   now than ever. When I was young we used to talk about seeing these old farts up on stage prancing and dancing and laughed about seeing them in the future thinking yah right, they'll be so crippled up they won't be able to move ...well the future is here, I'm crippled up and my buddy who joked about it is dead.  Anyway I have to admire them, all of them, for taking a kick at the can. Just think Gene Simmons just turned 60 and look at the life he's living!  The only way I would go to see Kiss on stage is if they will sell me tickets for what they went for in the 70's"
376694,Chris,2009-08-26 10:48:00,405," Haha good one Raf but....I'd much rather listen to a bunch of 60-year old former rock icons playing music that is actually good than all the ""drop-D"" regurgitated record industry Nickelback clones. But to each his own....  Let's see how popular ""Theory of a Puddle of Mudd 3 Doors Down"" is in 20 years."
376697,TC1OZ,2009-08-26 11:52:00,987,Didn't Kiss do the North Bay Canada Day Festival?
376699,blaque,2009-08-26 11:54:00,2419,VERY well said ChrisS LOL!. That being said however.........KISS's music still does nothing for me.
376703,TC1OZ,2009-08-26 12:01:00,987,  Just so you know....your parents said the same crap about Kiss.  Way to NOT become your parents...
376711,holdfast,2009-08-26 12:18:00,1813," NOW NOW, Id take them over any Eastern band anyday.  Even the Hip  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUGfNMBS-jY http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxOV12hfv2o  But YEA, nothing compares to Kiss"
376716,acmarou,2009-08-26 12:36:00,63,"Never liked those clowns anyway!!!! They should be shot, hung and urinated on!! The Shwa deserves better!!!!  I guess bad publicity is better than none at all.  Oh, by the way, I live in Toronto and wouldn't pay 2 cents to see those idiots. What they did is not cool!!!  Hell Man!!!! I didn't think I had that much power!!!  :lol: :lol:837am  CP24 just said OCT 7 is happening for Oshawa.  I still don't like them(Kiss) but good for Oshawa."
376720,anders,2009-08-26 12:47:00,1168,"In the article, they said they announeced the dates for the FIRST leg of the tour...not the COMPLETE tour.  We have to read the entire article before being hasty  From SooToday.com"
376724,Dara,2009-08-26 12:51:00,3052, They were only 40 bucks when I saw them 5 years ago
376743,wallyboss,2009-08-26 13:50:00,1095,"Let's not start comparing prices now!!!!!!!!!  Cause I would have to say that in 1976, I saw Supertramp in Ottawa 5 rows up and the ticket cost me $12.00.  Those were the days."
376767,chuckymcd,2009-08-26 15:22:00,144,oshawa is getting a kiss concert
377052,pikehunter,2009-08-27 10:27:00,1659,"LOl probably can still get Supertramp tickets for less than a 20 for, Roger played outdoors at this past Niagara Falls New Years Eve concert  for free! Now that's a price I like! Supertramp/Roger Hodgson Great music!"
376457,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2009-08-25 21:22:00,0,"Recently RnR legends KISS held a promotion for the first ever fan routed tour...Cities voted online for their city to get a kiss concert.  When the dust settled and results were tabulated, some smaller towns had many more votes than the major urban centres kiss was hoping for I guess.  The 1st place city (oshawa) and the 3rd place city (sault ste. marie) have been completely left off the tour despite obvioulsy having a very dedicated KISS following...Seems their contest backfired and they feel the 25,000 people who voted in these two cities don't matter.  Pathetic."
376465,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2009-08-25 21:30:00,0,here's an article from the dirty 'Shwa
376468,misfish,2009-08-25 21:35:00,29133,They played Rama? Thats a small town. Was the venue packed?
376472,Spiel,2009-08-25 21:39:00,9065,"""Kiss Sucks""  Indeed they do. From their conception to current day they have sucked all the way!"
376475,misfish,2009-08-25 21:44:00,29133,"  Chris,yer confused with suck face. Kiss dosent suck.LOL"
376477,richyb,2009-08-25 21:47:00,774,rama was packed both nights
376481,misfish,2009-08-25 21:49:00,29133,"  So that would mean,150 a ticket X 10,000 people= good choice."
376490,richyb,2009-08-25 22:23:00,774,just said on the news that oshawa had the most votes but doesnt have a big enough venue to hold everyone so they moved it to toronto
376495,TJQ,2009-08-25 22:35:00,7806,Then they should move the sault concert to sudbury.. lol
376499,Roy,2009-08-25 22:43:00,13728, They won't. Sudbury has anti-polution laws in place.
376510,danbo,2009-08-25 23:07:00,2646,I..wanna Rock & Roll all night & Party everyday..

376514,wallyboss,2009-08-25 23:13:00,1095,"Kiss in there prime were good rockers.   I don't want to give away my age but I was in the Kiss Army!!!!   Posters all over my room right beside the famous Farrah red bathing suit  , when I first bought a cd player it took me like 4 months to find KISS Destroyer. What a good album.  My Dad used to call them  ""Kiss My arse over the fence."""
376518,danbo,2009-08-25 23:23:00,2646,  
376525,PAZE,2009-08-25 23:32:00,132,"From what I herd there not done makeing tour dates in Ontario, Oshawa may get a big surprise yet, I have a feeling with all the votes they got from the Oshawa they'll do a later tour date for sure there."
376529,Sinker,2009-08-25 23:43:00,8692,Whatever.........the rama show was killer!!!  S.
376590,Raf,2009-08-26 01:43:00,3495,ewww this thread has old people reminiscing their about their youth in it..
376597,irishfield,2009-08-26 01:49:00,26272, LOL.. I'd rather watch Meatloaf fall of the stage in Ottawa and break his leg !
376601,Dara,2009-08-26 01:54:00,3052,"They were in the sault about 5 years ago. Sault Mich, at the casino..outdoor concert...it was pretty good. I can live without seeing them again.  wait...maybe we can get Tridico to fix the vote a bit more"
376602,danbo,2009-08-26 01:56:00,2646,Mem'ries is all we have RAF..
376604,Roy,2009-08-26 02:00:00,13728,"yeah, as long as we have our mammaries....."

376613,Dara,2009-08-26 02:10:00,3052,  He would steal their job...they are scared to show up
376621,Dara,2009-08-26 02:34:00,3052,Oshawa got Kiss for Oct 7  squeaky wheel and all    Maybe we can get Rowswell to whine a bit for us
376674,Stern Rules,2009-08-26 04:51:00,342,CTV said tonight that Oshawa is scheduled for Oct. 7th. Toronto is the 2nd.
