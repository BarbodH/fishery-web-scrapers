376809,Garry2Rs,2009-08-26 17:55:00,1425,"August is quickly slipping into the history file so I'd like to do a brief recap of the month. I started the month fishing with my friend JohnF.     We caught Large Mouth and Small Mouth Bass while we checked out several local lakes.   On the 6th one of my favourite little fishermen and his Dad dropped bye. His name is Aaron and he will start Grade One this year. He mastered the bait casting reel in one session and caught some nice Bass on Yum frogs...    That was the start of a couple of weeks of Father and Son outings... Here's Troy who brought his son Anthony   Jim and Jimmy...    And John and Devon.    More recently I have been out with DaveC and his friend Joe.   and James who always seems to attract big fish. This was last year...    And this was last week.    If I have some time off, I can always count on my neighbours Mike and Natalie to help me check out new locations...grin.    Incidentally, Natalie predicted there would be a big one under a certain fallen tree in a shallow bay. She couldn't reach it with her cast,  so she generously offered it to me...along with detailed instructions...HAHAHA.    James will be back on Friday and there is still the weekend, but this is how I will remember August 2009. Garry"

376815,anders,2009-08-26 18:29:00,1168,Great Job!  You look like you were ready for the links in the second pic.haha
376897,rbaquial,2009-08-26 21:48:00,968,Whoa! Pretty awesome!! 1st Grader ALREADY knows how to use a Baitcaster!! Awesome report BTW!
376900,misfish,2009-08-26 21:58:00,29133,  Nothing wrong with a man and a fish wearing crocs.  Great report Garry.
376902,GBW,2009-08-26 22:01:00,8460,"Ahh, another good month had by Garry and co.  some great fish there. As for the 6-year old (or so) with a baitcaster, DANG!  if I don't have a tail wind every few casts it's a birds nest...  LOL!"
376911,Spiel,2009-08-26 22:48:00,9065,Nice to see someone knows how to spend their well earned retirement years.
376941,JohnF,2009-08-27 00:13:00,3494," I didn't see any crocs on the fish.  As for me they make great boat shoes, and women stop me to ask where I get the orange ones.  JF"
376963,msp,2009-08-27 00:58:00,1336,Nice fishin up there this month ! Thanks for the report. Oh yeah. I have to ask........whats with the glove ?
376975,Garry2Rs,2009-08-27 01:19:00,1425,"The glove... Maybe I'm getting old, my thumb joints ache all the time.  It gets worse when I have to fish several days in a row. JohnF suggested I try a golf glove, he gave me one for my right hand and it seems to help...sort of like a tensor bandage. It's working out in other ways too...Like John I also have women stopping me to talk... They inquire if it's a Micheal Jackson tribute thing...HAHAHA."
377026,GBW,2009-08-27 03:38:00,8460,"come on Garry, it's because you have held up to many big fish over time.  much like a golf club you just need to regrip every now and then..."
377274,JohnF,2009-08-28 00:14:00,3494,Garry also admitted that it saved his tender pinkies from the fishy pointy things.  JF
