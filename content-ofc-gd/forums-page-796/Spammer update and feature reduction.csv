We apologise for the inconvenience but the new spamming software being used is slightly ahead of the software to combat it. We hope this makes it more difficult for the spammers and makes us too much trouble and they will move on. All the admins have been very busy blocking and deleting accounts, but they kept coming right back...so we kinda had to play hardball. We have taken other measures..some a bit more drastic than we wanted to, but the software we are up against is far more complicated than anything I have run into before. Its all over the internet the last few weeks. Should we find a way to combat it more effectively we can turn the Mass PM feature back on. The next generation software for the site will have more effective controls from what I have read, so until then we will keep doing what we can. Should you get any new spam PM's please let me know. Again, our apologies for the inconvenience and hopefully these dude's give up soon.  Oh yeah, if you go on vacation to either Senegal, South Africa or the Ivory Coast, you won't be able to access the site...lol."

376368,TC1OZ,2009-08-25 17:40:00,987,"Its too hot in Africa, you either pirate on a boat or you pirate from your shelter via the internet!"
376371,Billy Bob,2009-08-25 17:42:00,5865,Thanks Rick you're doing a GREAT job.  Bob
376372,bigfish1965,2009-08-25 17:49:00,3382," Total team effort, Billy Bob. Roy has been doing the bulk of the work. However, Marty has done nothing...but he's just eye candy anyway...lol."
376448,misfish,2009-08-25 21:12:00,29133,"Good job guys.   Thats just wrong,,,,,,,,,,,,The eye candy part. Well maybe not,he may be a big cotton candy kinda guy. HAHAHA"
376466,Rich Clemens,2009-08-25 21:32:00,3131,"No apologies needed Rick.  We all know you're doing the best you can.   I get the same crap here at work, even though we have a lot of filtering on our networks already.  The crap still keeps coming in."
376474,Spiel,2009-08-25 21:44:00,9065, And here I always thought of him more as an eye sore.
376512,Billy Bob,2009-08-25 23:08:00,5865,Can you image if these spammers put a honest effort into something...  But we know that's not going to happen.......
376526,Greencoachdog,2009-08-25 23:34:00,8163,  I always thought Spiel was the pretty one!
376527,danbouck,2009-08-25 23:37:00,4380,ok ok enough. We all know T.J. is the pretty one!
376533,bigfish1965,2009-08-25 23:49:00,3382," I can't decide between Chris and Dan, myself. "
376536,Roy,2009-08-26 00:20:00,13728," I've never really thought of Chris or Dan in those terms, Rick. You shouldn't really just be looking at physical appearance if looking to marry one of them though."
376537,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2009-08-26 00:24:00,0,those PM's were as close to a date as some members of this page have gotten!
376538,aplumma,2009-08-26 00:24:00,6896,Shhhhh  I think I hear banjo's .........    Art
376540,Roy,2009-08-26 00:26:00,13728, Step outside anywhere in Virginia and you'll hear banjos.
376551,Greencoachdog,2009-08-26 01:08:00,8163,  ... and the baaaaaaa of goats too!!!
376555,Dara,2009-08-26 01:15:00,3052, Hey!!!   I miss her already
376558,solopaddler,2009-08-26 01:19:00,8605, Exactly. It's more a case of fine custom built rods vs. big brookies.  Sorry Chris you lose!    
376564,bigfish1965,2009-08-26 01:23:00,3382," that was mean....true, but mean..sigh."
376746,Spiel,2009-08-26 14:00:00,9065," Awe shucks.    *drags toe through the sand*   Like Roy said.    Awe shucks, again."
376789,kickingfrog,2009-08-26 16:49:00,8333," Too bad, I here the phishing is pretty good there."
377197,ChrisK,2009-08-27 19:42:00,2772,Now my feelings are hurt All this time I thought I was the pretty one ??
377280,Daplumma,2009-08-28 00:27:00,1961,I'm with Chris on this one.
377286,Greencoachdog,2009-08-28 00:45:00,8163," Try not to ""suck-up"" so much... it detracts from your ""goat rider"" image!"
