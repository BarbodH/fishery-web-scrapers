376507,justin elia,2009-08-25 23:05:00,151,"Green, Blue, Black, Yellow and Orange are some good colours for Lake O.  Try Matrix, Pro King and Northern King spoons.  Have had a lot of success with those brands."

376574,Fang,2009-08-26 01:36:00,1330,Wanna go shopping? look up these colours  NBK 42 second Watermelon Tranny spoon Mongoose Jerry Lee (rainbows up high) Glow Frog  http://www.attheoak.com/spoons.html  These guys are a little ahead of the curve so check for new hot colors. They get em well before they get up here. I was reading about spin doctors on this site 2 years before I saw one in Canada
