377041,Cudz,2009-08-27 06:16:00,2652,"Once again I got out with Jaydub to hit up some of our spots on Simcoe.  It wasn't long before he had a very, very big fish on.  got it near the boat but he lost it!  We didn't have a net and I guess you could say it was my fault because I forgot to bring it.  Five minutes pass and Jaydub has another good fish on.  He loses that one as well. (I am kind of laughing inside because I had this problem last wed evening.)  Another five minutes pass and Jaydub hooks into yet another big bass.  After a good fight Jaydub manages to boat a new PB smallmouth.  Night fell and we started our usual topwater ritual.  Fish weren't hitting as hard tonight but we still managed quite a few.  Jaydub managed the biggest night bass as well.  Fun night and bigcongrats to Jaydub on a nice PB (see Jacques I told you we would beat his old PB). I was soundly outfished yet again tonight but as a consolation, I did catch the most fish.  Jaydub's big smallie  Same fish - look how fat she is  Good night smallie "

377107,danbo,2009-08-27 14:11:00,2646,What a fat sow!      WTG!!  YOU WIN>>  
377141,Cudz,2009-08-27 16:33:00,2652,She can still humble you at times. I have been fishing Simcoe for 23 years and still learn things all the time.  I have learned more in the past 4 years than I did the previous 19 together.  I actually study a 6 mile portion of the lake and know it really really well. I only have limited knowledge of a quater of the lake though.  It is so big with so much shoreline and different bottoms it is going to take me a lifetime to get a better understanding.  I don't think I will ever actually figure her out but for now it is fun.
377145,Dutchy,2009-08-27 16:58:00,416,What a fat fish. Very nice.
