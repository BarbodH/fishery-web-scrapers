375432,rbaquial,2009-08-23 03:30:00,968,"Hey Folks,  Just wondering if anyone's caught any Trout/Salmon at the mouth of rivers? Although we've had some serious HOT temps...I would assume not. But then again, we DID have a storm? and weather has been sorta cold lately... who knows?  I'd like to know... I'm planning on hitting some Piers....  Thanks, A2F (RoB)"
375433,BillM,2009-08-23 03:32:00,17367,Should be catching some chinnies soon enough...
375435,rbaquial,2009-08-23 03:36:00,968,"....This had me thinking... being that earlier in the year, it was my 1st real exposure to ""Float Fishing""....and chasing after Steelies....  Had me thinking... probably a ""stupid"" question, but regardless... its fishing related  Do Chinook eat/chase the same foods as Steelheads?  Anyone?"
375437,Ziki,2009-08-23 03:44:00,128,And it begins.
375439,highdrifter,2009-08-23 03:46:00,2534,"Shouldn't you be out there fishing??  Check the forecasts...  The nights shoud start to cool soon enough.  A strong north wind after a good rain is the ticket.  And if you plan on keeping anything, make sure you can ID the fish!!"
375443,angrypigeon,2009-08-23 03:58:00,31,"haha, destroyed.  i think a2f likes to read himself type."
375470,Twocoda,2009-08-23 09:32:00,4130,your enthusiasm is outstanding ....one of the best features of being a fisherman is ...always having something to look forward to .....dont wish the summer away just yet...before you know it ...youll be pulling chinneys from the river
375577,KelfuN,2009-08-23 18:54:00,246,the salmon run is over....it all happened overnight last thursday when my buddy and I hooked about 150 fish drifting skeins at a river mouth..the next day we went and not a single fish went up.
375593,BillM,2009-08-23 19:54:00,17367,  lol

375601,elusive,2009-08-23 20:36:00,77,  LOL I think he got all of them!
375609,redneck666,2009-08-23 20:53:00,563,"maybe you guys should move on up to good ol' sault ste. marie, theres always lots of salmon to go around. i havent seen a weak run sinse i've been here."
375829,River Rat,2009-08-24 14:23:00,161,"well...all I can say is....yawn, I'm tired. Big night last night!  RR"
375891,ricoboxing,2009-08-24 16:53:00,398,been seeing a bunch jumping chinnies in front of the oshawa pier lately.
375915,redneck666,2009-08-24 19:08:00,563,"  tell me, do big chunks of algae still come floating up around that pier? lol!"
375920,tdotfisherman,2009-08-24 19:18:00,317,we'll see tonight
376271,hendrix,2009-08-25 14:05:00,61,"bump, going to check it out tomorrow morning"
376360,lucabrasi,2009-08-25 17:27:00,114,"I usually don't start until I see a good crowd at the wall at Port Credit. When it's standing room only, it's time to chuck some glows off the rocks. Having said that, I did get out last night and needless to say there was lots of jumping, but no biting. Water is probably still a bit warm. I'm sure the next weather change will trigger some sort of run. Anybody ready for the 'salmon in the tribs' threads?"
376585,rbaquial,2009-08-26 01:42:00,968,  OH HEEEEEEEELLLLLLLL YEAAAAAAHHHH!!!! 
376607,tributaryhunter,2009-08-26 02:02:00,108,"i was out last sat nite on the pier, and my buddy got one around 30lb range, it only took him 10min or less on 6lb line talk about an easy fight for a chin this time of the year, they were surfacing all around us for 2 hrs i hooked into one and peeled line like crazy and snapped off, my buddy has the pictrure on his camera, sometime this week i'll post the pic if i have time, i'll be out fri nite again chuckin more spoons again cheers. the way i look at it, you dont know until you go, and keep trying and the reward will pay off."
