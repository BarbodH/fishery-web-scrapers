376850,TDunn,2009-08-26 20:13:00,680,"Hey OFC'ers  This report is going to include a few pics from fishing atlantic salmon and a week long trip I took north of Sault Ste. Marie. My girlfriend is lucky enough to have a camp just outside of Hornepayne. I was very excited for this trip as I havent been up to this camp for 3 years and this group of friends havent spent as much time together since having kids and moving for jobs. We took off a day earlier than everyone else so we could get a head start on getting the camp ready for a party of 14. 11 Adults (1 pregnant) and 3 kids (2 of which are babies). This was the first camp trip the parents have made with the children so nobody really knew what to expect but we all had our fingers crossed that things would work out....And they did! We had a blast, the kids slept well for the most part,we caught enough fish to keep everyone busy and have two good fish frys. On day one we started out with small fish at the places I have caught fish in previous years. Day two we decided to work our way down the lake into new water and we found more and bigger fish immediatly. By the end of the week we had five waypoints all within a one-two minute boat ride between eachother. We bascially sat on these spots for the week in the morning for 2-3 hours and the evening for 2-3 hours catching walleyes on jig/gulp, jig/realistics, jig/live minnow, crawler harness/split shot and slow death/split shot drifting with the wind over weeds in 5-10 feet of water. I had good intensions of trying to catch some whitefish with the aqua-view, a vexilar, wax worms and noodle rod I brought but never made it out due to higher winds all week and everyone having way to much fun fishing walleyes. Although the numbers were good, we didnt land any trophies on this trip.  The crew (from the soo, sudbury and thunder bay)        Rigging up      Minnow Trap    Fishin        Ranch Potatoes, broiled walleye and deep fried walleye                      Beer battered walleye leftovers     Anyways we had a great time can't wait to go back up....  Before the trip we were hitting up the St Marys for some atlantic action. I had the pleasure of fishing with a few different friends and family members during the atlantic season and most of them got into one!              Well the pacific salmon are up next.....Heading out tonight....  TDunn"
