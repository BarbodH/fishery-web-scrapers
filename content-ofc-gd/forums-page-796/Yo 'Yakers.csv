377003,danbo,2009-08-27 01:54:00,2646,Practice is a must.
377006,jediangler,2009-08-27 02:10:00,1923,Or just don't fall out.
377019,danbo,2009-08-27 03:00:00,2646,Actually..WE really need to learn this & ALWAYS wear a PFD.
377020,discophish,2009-08-27 03:01:00,392,"Before I even bought my kayaks, I took rolling clinics at a wave pool, the it progressed to the lessons in white water on the big Ottawa River.  It saves lives.  Sure looks like a lot of work (and unsafe) having to bail from your biggest floatation device other than your pfd ... just to get back in.  It's actually really easy to roll a flat water kayak upright, even with some gear on it.  It's not easy when you are tossed around like in a washing machine."
