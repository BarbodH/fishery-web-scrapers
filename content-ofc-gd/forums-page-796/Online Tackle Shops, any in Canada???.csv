If there is a problem it is the website which is essentially a PDF catalogue that you look through. It is not nearly as user friendly or packed with helpful stuff as Cabelas or BPS, but it is Canadian and in the end works very well. Jim"

Surprisingly enough, I get things much faster when I order from Japan than when I order from US or Canada."
