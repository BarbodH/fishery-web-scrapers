376822,fishinguypat,2009-08-26 18:59:00,547,i came across a rather interesting video on youtube concerning a new way to catch salmon/steelhead that out fishes roe! (i do not own this video nor is it my idea)    Check it OUT!
376826,solopaddler,2009-08-26 19:17:00,8605,Well that was 41/2 minutes of my life I'll never get back.
376832,The Birdfish,2009-08-26 19:30:00,73,"Not sure what that was, boring!!!!"
376837,solopaddler,2009-08-26 19:44:00,8605," Well not boring exactly....more like redundant. Plastic baits like that have been around forever. Yes they do work, generally not as good as the real thing. (Fast water being a notable exception). Also much of what he said about roe was based on using skein chunks on the left coast. Totally inapplicable to our great lakes fishery and the way we fish bait..."
376839,justin elia,2009-08-26 19:54:00,151,I'll pass on that idea.  Too many other better ways to target steelies and salmon.
376843,Dutchy,2009-08-26 20:04:00,416,First video I have seen in a while where beads were used like that lol. Ahem.
376845,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2009-08-26 20:08:00,0,they look like they are the size of grapes!
376863,fishinguypat,2009-08-26 20:35:00,547,yeah what came to mind for me was luhr ehnson
376878,steelhead hunter,2009-08-26 21:08:00,152,that's not a new steelie bait it's a cure for insomnia
376881,danbo,2009-08-26 21:13:00,2646,love beads..lol
376910,Spiel,2009-08-26 22:45:00,9065,Well it certainly isn't new. Friends and I were playing with this sort of thing as well as synthetic yarn pom poms from craft stores over thirty years ago. What goes around obviously comes around.
