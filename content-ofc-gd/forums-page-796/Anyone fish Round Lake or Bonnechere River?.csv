The old bridge is just upstream from the new one and has a launch ramp and parking nearby. Closer to Round lake is the Tramore bridge which has a sand and gravel launch right after you cross the bridge. You can catch pike, walleye, smallmouth and largemouth bass as well as perch and other panfish in the Bonnechere."
