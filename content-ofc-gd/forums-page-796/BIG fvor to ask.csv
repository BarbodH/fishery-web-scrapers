376467,River Rat,2009-08-25 21:33:00,161,"hey everybody, I am working on a project and I need one of those old canvas lifejackets like the kind from the Titanic or something really old looking like that. I can pick it up and drop it off after and I'll leave you something for collateral just to be sure I return it in cas you are worried about that. I just need it for a few days and it will not be damaged...  if anyone can help me out I'd really appreciate it.  Cheers  RR"

They are fantastic people down there, real enthusiasts that could perhaps get into your project. Short of them are there any other marine museums you can think of (there is a fishing museum in Port Dover)? Good Luck! Jim"
