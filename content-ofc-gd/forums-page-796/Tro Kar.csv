376763,MCTFisher9120,2009-08-26 15:11:00,3761,Was browsing/getting ready to make a purchase today on Cabela's web site(US) and well those Tro Kar hooks Dave was talking about are on sale. Maybe somebody already knew this but hey I didn't. Think I'm going to try a pack and see what happens. http://www.cabelas.com/cabelas/en/common/s...h-box.jsp.form1  O and those new Shimano reels are up on there also.  MTBF
376776,angrypigeon,2009-08-26 16:02:00,31, didn't you post yesterday about having a lot of useless tackle?  don't you see a pattern here?  haha
376788,MCTFisher9120,2009-08-26 16:44:00,3761,"  You got a point. Looking more at upgrade spinning tackle and well terminal tackle like hooks and speciality jigs.  You know, stuff that isn't needed. Would still sell all of my gear in a heart beat. for a couple hundred. Would love the opportunity of a fresh start as I can't throw stuff away or give it away for free."
376905,ecmilley,2009-08-26 22:22:00,2163,"more than happy with my owner cutting points and mustad ultra-point hooks why waste money ordering hen you can pick up packs of both of these for far less coin from gagnons hirks, ct"
376913,solopaddler,2009-08-26 23:01:00,8605," I remember vividly what I was like at your age: Almost all birthday and Christmas presents were of the fishing variety. Any money that I did manage to hoard, I'd spend days pouring over various fishing catalogues agonizing over what to spend it on.  I know how much 200 bucks is to a young guy like yourself, but the reality is it's a drop in the bucket. Said it yesterday already, but hold onto your stuff and build on it.  If you're just dying to buy some gear and money is tight, do what I did when I was in my early teens, get a part time job."
376915,Spiel,2009-08-26 23:03:00,9065, Is this the same part time job you have now Mike.
376939,solopaddler,2009-08-27 00:06:00,8605, Wise    LOL!  You wanna come to the Attawapiskat next week?
377070,Spiel,2009-08-27 12:13:00,9065," Here, let me open the wound so you can get the salt in deeper.  Sorry for taking this off track MTBF."
377086,MCTFisher9120,2009-08-27 13:22:00,3761,"Hey now, you two. This thread is Tro Kar only   And I do have a part time job. But no employer, just people to work for...I'll give you a hint, I do this service for about 20 people and it includes a lawnmour and weed wacker.  Gee, what could I be doing (part time)"
377087,Spiel,2009-08-27 13:27:00,9065,  Sounds kinky.
377096,solopaddler,2009-08-27 13:47:00,8605, Good for you.
377099,MCTFisher9120,2009-08-27 14:00:00,3761," Lmao, depends who's lawn I'm mowing"
377103,mbac31,2009-08-27 14:07:00,904,Dont waste your money. I have them and they are nothing special. Yes they are as sharp as they say but basically same as all the rest. They will hook up something firece if you are not carefull.
377112,Marko,2009-08-27 14:24:00,854," Hope the grass is not too thick hahah, if it is they better tip well"
377114,richyb,2009-08-27 14:31:00,774,They look like a waste of money to me. Just another hook but this one happens to have your idol advertising for them. I would spend my money other ways.
377117,BillM,2009-08-27 14:46:00,17367,"Until you find your current terminal tackle isn't doing the job, save your $$$$.."
377153,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2009-08-27 17:15:00,0,"there is always going to be ""the next advancement in"" some element of fishing.  when i was in my teens i spent countless dollars buying whatever the rage of the season was and ended up with a box full of expensive crap... when it comes to terminal tackle, i would definitely buy quality gear, but do so wisely...  don't buy red wolf or junk like that, but fishing like anything else is full of marketing gimmicks!  i think a sharper skill set will catch more fish than ""the sharpest hook""...  flying lure anyone?  how about a banjo minnow?"
377162,richyb,2009-08-27 17:24:00,774,   HEY !!!! the flying lure landed me my biggest largemouth and a couple of pike. Funny thing is it only worked for that one day lol. havent got a fish on them since. Must have been those stupid sudbury area fish.
377170,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2009-08-27 17:54:00,0,i guess all the fish since didn't see the infomercial!
377173,Jds63,2009-08-27 18:06:00,1365,"ahh yes I agree ... when I was a young whipper snapper ... I spent my hard earned money on all those gimicky lures as well, still got em though .... gotta admit that banjo minnow worked , but so did a hook and a worm ...LOL  Now i have setup a separate tackle box for my son with all those lures ... LOL , he doesn't mind using them   remember ""lures are designed to catch fisherman first"""
