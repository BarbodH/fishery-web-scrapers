376163,Cudz,2009-08-25 06:36:00,2652,Went out again tonight after sunset and caught some decent fish.  I lost as many as I caught and had loads of blow ups.  My best tonight was only 3.05 pounds and my buddy got a 4.05 pounder.  Not as big as last week's fish but it was still fun.  We both caught rock bass as well.  They love to hit at night and they hit the topwater stuff as well. I can't really complain because I lost my favourite night fishing lure the other day and did not have it tonight.  I bought something similar at BPS on Friday and it caught all my fish.  I am happy about that. my biggest smallie of the night   JT's big smallie (4.05 pounds)   Rockbass - fat little guy but he looked a bit beat up. 
376165,hoot33,2009-08-25 06:42:00,93,what was your favorite lure and your replacement if you dont mind me asking?
376166,Cudz,2009-08-25 06:45:00,2652,five of diamonds. replaced it with a red devil.
376191,Radnine,2009-08-25 11:54:00,1538,You use a five of diamonds for smallies? (really?) Is this deception at its best? I wouldn't have thought of even trying a spoon for bass. Jim
376203,Cudz,2009-08-25 12:30:00,2652,Very very sneaky I am.
376205,Greencoachdog,2009-08-25 12:32:00,8163,"  You wouldn't happen to be full of it, would you?... and aren't you supposed to be fishing with Dollarama tackle only?"
376208,Harrison,2009-08-25 12:36:00,2202,"Nice fish!  Used to guide night trips on Simcoe, no matter how many you catch it still scares the livin crap out of ya when they smash it boat side.  Pop r's - Chug Bugs (especially the longer ones/saltwater)my go to - Zara spooks fulll size - Lucky craft Sammies - Full size Heddon Torpedos are all sure bets on Simcoe after dusk."
376214,TC1OZ,2009-08-25 12:46:00,987,Nice fish Cudz! If I didn't have the little one I'd talk my wife into stopping at Lake Simcoe on the way to the cottage next month haha! Looks like some good fishing!
376263,MCTFisher9120,2009-08-25 13:49:00,3761,"Nice job, I'm heading to Lake Seymour this weekend. Definitely throwing around the skitter pop at night and early in the mornings."
376270,Cudz,2009-08-25 14:05:00,2652,spooks and pop r's work.  I have and older bagley's topwater that works as well. You are right about the hits by the boat.  Most hits come as soon as or right after the lure hits the water but those by the boat do freak you out a bit.
376534,Cudz,2009-08-25 23:49:00,2652,Here is the sam fish (the 4.05) with a different camera.  Quality is not good but shows the size better 
376553,solopaddler,2009-08-26 01:12:00,8605,"Can't believe Bill hasn't seen this and chimed in. 5 of Diamonds is entirely believable. He's caught almost all his fish on one over the last month LOL! Walleye, pike, lakers, and brookies.. I've caught tons of smallies on spoons when targeting pike.  However I rarely get ""blowups"" on them when night fishing."
376565,Dara,2009-08-26 01:24:00,3052,"I rarely target Bass, but when I do my best lure is an old Goldfish spoon, next to that is a bent piece of gold metal that looks like a centipede. I slow troll both of them.Got em in those grab bags my dad used to buy 40 years ago.  Daytime fishing...not night"
376592,ironstone74,2009-08-26 01:44:00,201,Nice fish man!  I should try topwaters after dark... but I'm afraid of the dark.  Paul
