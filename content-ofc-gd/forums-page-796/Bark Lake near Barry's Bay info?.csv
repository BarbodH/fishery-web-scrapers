Not looking for GPS points, just something to get me started.  Thanks in advance for whatever you may be able to contribute.  Dan"

I know there is bass walleye pike and lakers in there, just have to find them lol."

Did great workin the mouth of the river coming into the lake and workin humps along the main basin in about 35ft of water.  depending on the weather/conditions you should be able to find em with the help of some electronics OR a good topo map"
