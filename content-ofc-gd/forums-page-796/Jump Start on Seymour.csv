Does anybody want to give me a start up on baits to try out there for this time frame, it's been a year since I last fished there at the end of August and I pulled in a 4lb largie off shore so I know big bass are there.  Going to start off with a 1/20z black/blue bass jig, a 3"" chigger craw and a skitter pop...Let's face it, I always catch the bass. Sometimes only a few and other times lot's but I don't think a SKUNK has been issued all year for me.  So, any suggestions? I know green tube's kill there but I won't have boat access(or green tubes) so that's a no go. So aside from that, how has the fishing been out there and most importantly what's been working.  Thanks, MTBF"

376405,Harrison,2009-08-25 19:29:00,2202," Yep, jinx.  There will be a giant slop mat blown up along the whole shoreline now.  But, by the above statement you'll figure it out"

376429,MCTFisher9120,2009-08-25 20:32:00,3761,"   Uh oh, do I have some fokes that don't think I can get the job done  I guarantee(yes I said it) that I will be able to catch some bass, and hopefully some bass bigger than a pound or so lol.  Mark my words(Like the Pens winning the Cup, and Skeet Reese winning the classic)! MTBF"
