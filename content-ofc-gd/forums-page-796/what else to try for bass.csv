376653,skinny,2009-08-26 03:23:00,442,i havn't been able to get to the pond untill about 9am in the morn or till after 7 at night and I only shore fish at this time

376692,singingdog,2009-08-26 10:30:00,1047,"Buzzbaits and topwater frogs are fun, but are low-percentage presentations. IMHO, on any body of water there are 5 fish that will hit subsurface presentations for every one that will hit a surface lure.  My first 2 choices for an additional presentation would be a 1/2 oz spinnerbait or texas-rigged plastics: lizards, grubs, curly tail worms...."
