376198,chuckymcd,2009-08-25 12:26:00,144,"Hey everyone i was out with a couple of buddies on the weekend checking out georgian bay we were just about to change spots when we say a boat comming straight at us, then the cherries came one.  They were checking for fishing linsences and safty equipment on the boat.  This was my first time being stopped on the water. They were really nice guys but they would not tell us where the fish were at     Everyone had their fishing lisences and all the proper safty equipment  Just a reminder to everyone to boat safe and carry all the needed safety equipment  Oh yeah we did not catch any fish any body know what to through in the georgian bay area we were not to far from midland"

376218,TC1OZ,2009-08-25 12:51:00,987,Good thing the fuzz didn't ruin your good time
376222,chuckymcd,2009-08-25 12:59:00,144," naw they were pretty good about everything, they have a great job tho hanging out on the boat all day"
376226,TC1OZ,2009-08-25 13:04:00,987, Tell me about it.. And the last OPP boat I saw when I was in Parry Sound was a SICK boat.. Every citizen of Ontario should be allowed to take a ride on it at full speed...since we are paying for it! hahaha.
376244,Governator,2009-08-25 13:31:00,879,We've been stopped a couple of times on simcoe and they've always been super nice.  They generally seem to do a great job making sure everyone is safe and up to date with licenses.
376258,MCTFisher9120,2009-08-25 13:46:00,3761," I was up in Parry Sound area of G-Bay on the weekend and had a hard time landing fish also. Caught 3 or 4 small 1lb or less smallies and missed a pike...aside from that nothing, was not impressed."
376276,goteeboy,2009-08-25 14:22:00,175,"We got checked yesterday on Rice.  They were very nice.  Well the lady was nice, the dude didn't talk much.  Had my safety equip scattered all over the boat . need to organize, haha. got a little nervous when my flashlight didn't work, but finally got it working. i had forgotten that it's a button, not a twist."
376357,ciceri,2009-08-25 17:21:00,535,Worms work good for us.
376367,chuckymcd,2009-08-25 17:36:00,144, HAHAHa at least u got it working
376456,glen,2009-08-25 21:19:00,2641,Did they ask if you were fishing muskie on a conservation licence?
376461,kuhaman,2009-08-25 21:25:00,503,"Were the OPP and the CO's in the same boat? Never seen that before, I hardly ever even run into a game warden in the places I fish."
376469,bubbles,2009-08-25 21:36:00,591,"We get checked constantly on the Detroit River, OK by me, just doing their job.  Both in the same boat or each on their own boat, I have seen them both."
376473,irishfield,2009-08-25 21:42:00,26272, LOL ... good 'ol Bruce Ward. You'll never forget him though will you Glen!  Good to see them out! OPP and CO always together on the Bay.
376508,glen,2009-08-25 23:06:00,2641,I am going to fish out there this year just so i can show him my sport fishing licence.  Maybe you can join me in my boat this year Wayne.  We can hit some smaller lakes too.
376523,camillj,2009-08-25 23:32:00,1988,I have a little mini keychain type flash light in every PLano box .. just in case ... there's no laws about how big they have to be ... and one of them is BOUND to work  Also carry a couple spare AA's in every plano box ... can always do the switcharoo  Always together on gbay in my experience ....on lake Joe normally just OPP ... and often with a camera wanting pics (probably as evidence - but I am glad to oblige
376612,POLLIWOGG,2009-08-26 02:09:00,835,Actually you have to have one working waterproof flashlight probably visible for one mile or more I'd have to look it up I have a book in the shop that might have it.. But there is no law that says you can't have a boat full of flashlights.
