711827,Roy,2012-07-05 02:14:00,13728,I have been asked to lock this thread by Mercman.  Getting along is a good thing.... sometimes it doesn't happen so much.
711754,UglyBug,2012-07-04 23:29:00,148,"In the imortal works of Conan the Barbarian "" do you want to live forever""  You guys are way to serious about this. Chill out guys. "
711757,GBW,2012-07-04 23:36:00,8460,"I'm not being too serious, just pointing out something that you may not have seen or heard of.  Hell, I don't think your brother was on this site back then when it happend.  Just pointing out that anything can happen at any given time.  My boat hit's 61MPH and I go WOT all the time.  Just saying heads up cause you don't always hear or see a problen right in front of you some times."
711761,mercman,2012-07-04 23:47:00,7054,"  We get the point Geoff.In reallity, there is no one i feel safer with on the water than my Brother.We were taught properly by a man both mechanically and safety minded. And BTW, i am the quiet one in the familly , so rather than get this thread locked, lets get back to the original reason i posted it. To share what i feel, is a real adrenakine rush, and great day on the water with 2 fishing brothers."
711763,hirk,2012-07-04 23:57:00,571," Ok well if I was you I wouldnt be prop shopping yet,that tempest if its clean should be about as good as it gets for you performance wise,pull the plugs it should cut your holeshot time to less than half what it is now. You wont gain 5 mph with another prop unless you can majically turn more rpm cause a bigger pitched wheel will turn less an not be faster. As for your buddy running 80 in a 521 he must of left his gps on driving the 401 cause thats the only way it could happen  and before you try and convince me it does, I have a very good idea what different boats/engines will run and my last bassboat ran low 90's so I know what it takes to break 80 and what a 521 will do and its not 80 ."
711764,GBW,2012-07-04 23:57:00,8460,"I don't lock post's Paul, well not here... I just add my $0.02 when I feel it's gone on too long in the wrong way."

And just for the record I listen to those I really know not those who I have never met. It not a sign of disrespect but one of choosing who you trust  Oh and since it's my boat in the vid I suggest you remove this post ASAP  Ta ta all

I just say that those who I have Been chatting with on the side seem like really great people and those i can learn from.

Most of us watch (and cheer) bass boats in our favorite tournys, and watch sea doos fly by us on a daily basis regardless of what were running, and....  Lets be a little more respectful people(members). It's fine to add your two cents in a respectful manner, when it's on a topic that warrants discussion. The speed of bass boats may warrant discussion, but not in this post IMO.  I see two brothers having fun RESPONSIBLY. Not breaking any laws, just enjoying a day on the water together. And doing so in a completely acceptable matter (as per the laws).  I enjoyed the vid, glad you guys had alot of fun as well  Sorry Merc, just seen you asked to have it locked"

711572,aplumma,2012-07-04 14:45:00,6896,You don't need a big motor to be an ass on the water. I have had people in 9.9 do thinks that I have never seen an over powered bassboat do. I own 2 jetskis and 4 boats from a 10ft pontoon to a 28ft twin inboard and in no case has it been the motor size that makes a mistake. They all have different uses it is like a toolbox I don't have to use a bassboat on the shallow river and damage it I can use the jet drive. I use the bassboat to get to an area I want to fish and the layout of it makes it pleasant to fish. Don't blame the high performance for poor judgement and bad decisions.  Art

I have been fishing this lake for 19 years straight so I kinda have a good handle on it. Only once did I hit something and it was not with a bass boat but a tinner doing 20 kph. Its like anything, watch, listen, and learn. Talk to people who run the body of water and use common sense. ""Oh wait common sense is not common any more. "" I figure more people die on their way to work each day than boat accidents. So if I'm going to go, I want to be screaming down the lake in my boat doing somthing I love to do.  Thanks for your concerns for my safety, and your opinions, they are all well received, But if you ask any fast boat driver, if they are honest they will all say getting there is alot of the fun.

711746,Henricus,2012-07-04 23:16:00,118,"Looks like fun to me but as much fun as I think 60mph is, it is not that fast for a bass boat especially as you get passed by a SeaDoo.  When you see a bb go past you doing 70+ or even touching 80, that's fast.  I once owned a boat that could break 80mph (<16' Larson w/150 merc; 28 chopper) and re-propped it for skiing instead simply b/c it was insane; too light and it was like flying a plane.  Sixty is still pretty manageable in my opinion.  Btw, looking at your hole shot, are you trimmed fully down at the start?"
711747,UglyBug,2012-07-04 23:16:00,148,Nice try   But if I do replace it I will keep it as spare. It does have the PVS and plugs are at 3/4 so I might remove them and see. 
711751,UglyBug,2012-07-04 23:21:00,148,Got to remember its a smaller Ranger which is why they cal them lead sleds. The boats is only really rated to do about 62 to 65 so it's close. Yes trimmed all the way down. Friend of mine has a 521 that does 80 that's fast. Oh an nope don't jump to many boat wakes but I don't shy away from them if they creep up.

711456,fish_fishburn,2012-07-04 01:42:00,1311,"What was wrong with that? Looked like a nice pickeral chop which is perfect for running a bass boat. Fishing and speed go together so nice. And I love the feeling you get from a V6 2 stroke. So much torque, its sic. Not so nice when your the passenger and the pilot is just learning, can be down right frightening. Not insinuating anything Mercman just saying."

711515,UglyBug,2012-07-04 11:12:00,148,"Ok to all you who are whining about bass boats going to fast and buzzing people. Let me set the record straight. I always goes as fast as i can because I can, If i wanted to do slower I would by a Princecraft (kiddin Paul) I always steer clear of other boats because I want to, and its the right thing to do, I always wear my PFD because you should, and oh yeah I always catch those fish because I'm good at it. What drives me out of my freakin mind is others who have no idea what they are doing. examples anchoring in the main channel, Failing to yield, fauilure to respect others,jet skis owners who think they own the lake( yes I was told that last time I was out fishing  ) and finally those who try to say that going fast has no place in fishing. To you all I say  How many of you go faster than allowed on the highway or maybe tailgate to close or talk on cell).  I and most bass boat owners that I know are very capable drivers and would never want to kill themselves over fishing, let alone mess up those pretty boats. So as I am zooming by to reduce the wake, I will wave politely to ya""ll and be on my merry way.  And yes the hole shot is something I am working on right now. I have been messing with the WOT and water pressure. Now its time to re-prop..   Also before you blow a gasket think before you type, it makes for a nicer day I think.  Ps: Paul Rain suit will be shipped today   "
711521,SmokestackLightnin,2012-07-04 11:33:00,390,"Why do you have to travel so fast, the answer is simple, because you can. A car is no different. For the most part, it's not the machine that is the issue, it's the operator. Whether it be a bass boat, jet ski, ATV, large cruising boat, etc. The list goes on and on about machines that for some reason or another people have issues. Unfortunately you don't have to pass an I.Q. test or an etiquette test to buy any of them. From the video I would say the operator of this Ranger is a good one. He made sure he had a clear lane before taking off, he is made sure his passenger was set, he is wearing a PFD and he has on hearing protection.  From my experience, it doesn't matter what kind of boat it is, an ""idiot"" behind the wheel is still an ""idiot""."
711541,mercman,2012-07-04 13:02:00,7054,"  Now thats what i call setting it straight !!!  Right on all counts Bro.Like the 2 chunky monkeys on the seadoos that buzzed us cause we are purdy:rolleyes: If this gets outta hand i will delete it, no worries."
