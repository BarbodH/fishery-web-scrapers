I had a ton of work to do so my only fishing was between 5am - 7am and 8pm - 10pm.  Saturday  That morning I started bass fishing for the first hour or so without a hit. So I decided to hit up some pike spots. The pike were CRAZY     I was getting one every cast for 45 minutes. Most were around the 30"" mark. Unfortunately I only had my iphone to take pics.        That night I brought my camera with me and of course only landed snot rockets, a bowfin and some WGSF. I did mess around with my suction cup mount a bit.      Sunday  Sunday was an interesting day. I managed to sneak out at lunch while the kids were busy. I managed to catch a new PB and a funny surprise. Luckily I found some people to snap a pic for me.    That night we had a fire on the beach and enjoyed everyone's fireworks from down the beach              Monday  We decided to take the boat to Turkey Point and anchor so that the kids could swim and play with some different scenery.            I have this one trained pretty well  "
