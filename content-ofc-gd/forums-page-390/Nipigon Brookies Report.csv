I'll let the Pictures do the talking. On the way back to Thunder Bay to catch our flight we stopped at the Terry Fox monument, it should be on everyoneâ€™s bucket list.            "

711429,danc,2012-07-04 01:19:00,4677,"Sweet report on the Brookies, and thanks for mentioning the Terry Fox monument. I've driven past it a thousand times (on my way to Nipigon) and still pop in for a look from time to time. It's a special place. Bucket list material for sure. I went up there several years ago at night and took a few pics. This one I liked best.  "
