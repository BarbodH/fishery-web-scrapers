711373,skeeter,2012-07-03 23:48:00,1907,"The renovations have begun!  The shingles are the first step. These had to go.     With the help of Tracker(Don) and Renee, we started striping the old shingles and tar paper off.    Then we install the 2 sky lights.  That was fun-LOL  Then comes the roofing paper .      On Monday Ron (Skipper) showed up to give Don and I a hand with the shingles, which made the job a lot easier.  The roof had no vents on it to let the hot air out, so we installed 4 new vents on it, and the shingles.         The next step is to replace all the thin cheap trailer windows with real house windows. Single hung tilt sliders, which means that they slide up/down and you can tilt them inside the trailer to clean the outside windows from inside. ;D  Then the new siding will be going on.  Thanks for the help Don, Renee and Ron !!!  :thumbsup_anim: Now the roof looks GREAT !!!"

711400,skeeter,2012-07-04 00:25:00,1907," ""Gentek Building Products"" You measure the size of windows you need, then order them. It takes 2 weeks for them to make them and they are good windows!"
