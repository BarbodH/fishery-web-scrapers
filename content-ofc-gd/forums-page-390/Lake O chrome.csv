By far the best charter experience i have ever had, this guy is a class act Pro and does it right.  He lost his patience with us a few times ""DONT LOOK AT THE FISH!"" we were all spoon pulling rookies, and he was more upset with the lost fish than us especially the trophy brown my brother in law lost at the back of the boat.  He gave us some tips and worked his butt off to find the fish next thing ya know the rods were firing pretty steady we even had one tripple header (pretty intresting with 6 dipsy's and 2 riggers out. We were out from 6am -1pm and went 10 for 19  he apologized and said this was a slow day with small fish lol. Anyways me and the family had a blast and i will let the pictures do the talking. i will be back for sure.  this guy gets my unconditional approval.
