711352,hotsky,2012-07-03 22:52:00,400,I would like to check out Lake St. Clair and was wondering if anyone knows a place that rents fishing boats on the lake?
711354,rmarentette,2012-07-03 22:58:00,124,The only one that I'm aware of is Bass Haven in Mitchell's Bay. Phone 519-354-4242  http://marinas.com/marina_out.php?id=6278&subtype=marina
711366,hotsky,2012-07-03 23:29:00,400,Thanks! love this site  Btw how the pike/musky fishing nearby (Mitchell's Bay)?
711462,Djeep,2012-07-04 01:54:00,199,"pike fishing is good, some muskie are in the area. deeper water 8 ft+ for any decent pike usually and yes thats kinda deep for ol lsc. probably get good direction at the launch, might even see ya there if its on a weekend haha."
711466,hotsky,2012-07-04 02:00:00,400,"Thanks, how far would you have to go to get to 8ft depth? I remember reading that average depth is only 10 ft."
711512,Djeep,2012-07-04 11:04:00,199,a mile or so out of the channel should get you in some decent water. 2 miles even better but watch the weather can get a lil nasty some days.
711517,Handlebarz,2012-07-04 11:18:00,3790,Like Ron and Rolly said head to Bass Haven Dennis will give you great advice on where the daily bite is you are not far from good fishing when you leave bass haven.
711545,bigmac1984,2012-07-04 13:15:00,193,"Bass Haven for sure....  To get to 8' of water, its about 1.5 miles out.... Market Buoys XE2 and XE4 and in that general area are lots of weed/sand transitions and 8' + of water. For a map of the lake, go to www.marinecruiser.com/chart  and you will be able to see the contours and depths. Bass Haven is in the top right most part of the map in Mitchell's bay. You can usually get out there and see the pack of boats and know where some action is. Pike fishing is decent, the bass are on fire. There have been a few tournaments in the past few weekends where 20+ lbs has won it, and 6.5lb big fish. I was out last thursday and caught a whole bunch of LMB, the biggest of which was 4lbs 5oz, as well as some smallies. Tubes and white spinnerbaits were the ticket that day."
