710989,redpearl99,2012-07-02 21:53:00,259,so Im going to the zoo with the girlfriend for the day tomorrow and wanted to take her fishing for the first time at frenchman's bay down the road.  can someone tell me what type of fish I should be targeting at this time of the year from shore? I was thinking of just setting her up with a bobber and live worms
711032,Photoz,2012-07-03 01:20:00,792,"Depending upon what kind of rod & reel she's using (a'Dora The Explorer equivalent won't cut it for what I'm gonna suggest) buy a can of corn & load up a #2 or #4 hook with it, toss it out (on bottom, no float needed) and HANG ONTO YOUR ROD . . . .   do you figure she can hang onto 12-  -  30 pounds of big pizzed off carp? Have fun, amd also, DO NOT SET YOUR ROD DOWN & TAKE YOUR EYES OFF IT!"
711067,redpearl99,2012-07-03 04:40:00,259,"ahh yes, the good old carp.... I've caught some monster 30lb carps in that area over the years.  how plenty are the bass and smaller fish in that bay at this time of the yr.  Making sure she catches something is more important than size."
