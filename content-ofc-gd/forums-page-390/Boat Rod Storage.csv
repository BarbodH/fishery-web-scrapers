711249,sneak_e_pete,2012-07-03 19:46:00,540,So a reply to one of my other posts got me thinking.  I just bought a Smokercraft Promag.  Never thought to test out the rod storage.  It has in-floor storage for 8 rods with tubes.    I have 7ft one piece rods and the eyes are too big to slide into tubes ( what are boat manufacturers thinking).  Anyone else encounter this problem?
711259,lew,2012-07-03 20:10:00,12766,"Maybe the tubes were designed for baitcast rods and your using spinning rods ??  What happens if you remove the tubes, will the rods still go in ??"
711263,sneak_e_pete,2012-07-03 20:14:00,540,"Havent tried taking out the tubes (good suggestion).  All of my rods are spinning.  Other than the rod storage, i am thoroughly impressed with the boat.  Almost hurt to get some slime on it...had to give a thorough clean after lol"

711270,johnnyb,2012-07-03 20:23:00,3413,Wow...you'd think the rod storage would accomodate....but either way....you need some baitcasters man

711272,jedimaster,2012-07-03 20:30:00,3472,Can you shorten the length of the tubes? or replace them with golf club tubes?
711273,PainInTheBass,2012-07-03 20:31:00,102,"I also have a Smokercraft (Millentia) and find that depending on the size and configuration of the guides on spinning rods, they will not fit into the rod locker tubes.  My solution is to not put them in since my more valuable rods are all baitcasters.  I haveheard of people removing the tubes and being able to fit more rods into those slots.  I am not sure if that will work for allowing a spinning rod to fit since the hole would still be only slightly larger than the tube.  If it does work, be careful putting your rods into the holder, and removing them.  I fear the loss of some guides."
711409,smally21,2012-07-04 00:49:00,993,"i have those tubes in my stratos, the first large guide doesnt actually enter the tube so they fit.  however..i cant recall breaking as many rods as i do now. several have come out of the tubes broken. perhaps on the way in but i think i would notice.  ive broken 3 or 4 since i got the boat, all going into or out of the tube.  dont think i ever broke a rod before i had this slick rod locker."
