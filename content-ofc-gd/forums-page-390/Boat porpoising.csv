711397,smally21,2012-07-04 00:21:00,993,sorry doubled.
711475,fish_fishburn,2012-07-04 02:24:00,1311,Maybe thats why you got a smoking deal on that boat Mike.
711476,BillM,2012-07-04 02:32:00,17367, Mike's not talking about his new boat.
711477,solopaddler,2012-07-04 02:34:00,8605,  I believe you may be right!  I'll get it figured out though. Worst case scenario I'll sell the '08 Merc and put something a bit smaller like an Evinrude Etec on it.
711478,fish_fishburn,2012-07-04 02:35:00,1311,"Mike and Pete, have you guys tried calling and speaking to someone at the manufacturer? Tell them your problem and what you have and they should be able to email you a schematic or a photo of a proper set up. I can pretty well gaurantee you they won't be telling you that you need tabs"
711479,BillM,2012-07-04 02:38:00,17367,"  Wait, the new boat is doing this?  LOL"
711480,solopaddler,2012-07-04 02:40:00,8605, Actually I was talking about the old boat and the new boat.     Never thought to as I've had it looked at by supposed professionals.  Definitely can't hurt.
711483,Sinker,2012-07-04 02:46:00,8692," Are they water testing it, Mike?  It just doesn't make sense to me....  S."
711495,solopaddler,2012-07-04 03:55:00,8605," Yep, they've had it out 4 times now as they've tried different fixes."
711610,fish_fishburn,2012-07-04 17:27:00,1311,"Lots of marine mechanics are professionals when it comes to fixing them, but are not so professional when it comes to setting them up. Just saying."
711233,sneak_e_pete,2012-07-03 19:09:00,540,"Hey.  I actually broke down and put some smart tabs on.  Absolutely amazing difference.  Planes early, zero bounce.  Was very enjoyable to be out in.  I opened her up and after playing with the trim I got 68 kmph.  The Suzuki 140 is more like a 115, when compared to a Merc, but I chose longevity over top speed.  68 kmph is fast enough for me!  To top it off, got into some great Lake Erie perch.  Schools were crazy!"
711235,hutch4113,2012-07-03 19:15:00,374," How difficult were they to install?  I don't have a hole shot/planing issue with the smaller prop.  Even with 4 people it popped out of the water easy.  But I couldn't get full speed out of it, due to the bounce.  Had to keep reducing the plane until it was stable."
711236,hutch4113,2012-07-03 19:16:00,374, Forgot also to ask - unrelated.  The Rod Storage.  How have you been finding it for storing your Fishing Rods?  I am assuming you are collapsing them?
711241,sneak_e_pete,2012-07-03 19:24:00,540,"Plane easy.  My same issue was the bounce and it is gone.  Took 1/2 hour to install... Super easy.  Ya, the rod storage sucks.  I have 4 7ft one piece rods and the rod eyes are too big too big to fit in the tubes."
711246,hutch4113,2012-07-03 19:42:00,374," Ok.  I have the same problem.  I am thinking of pulling (or trying to) out the inserts.  I think they move (maybe).  My spinning rods break down, so they store fine.  But I am moving into baitcasters, which appear to be mostly 1 piece."
711253,solopaddler,2012-07-03 19:50:00,8605,  Told ya.  Very glad to hear you've solved the problem.
711286,fish_fishburn,2012-07-03 20:49:00,1311,"Im thinking raising the motor one increment at a time and trying it would do the trick. These boats don't need trim tabs, just have to have the motor set up properly."
711293,solopaddler,2012-07-03 21:07:00,8605,  Not true. I tweaked my Lund before putting on the trim tabs and nothing helped.
711299,fish_fishburn,2012-07-03 21:17:00,1311,"Ive been around boats for over 40 yrs and have never seen an aluminum under 20 ft with trim tabs. Also have never experienced any tinny or bassboat with porpoising problems that cant be fixed by adjusting the height of the motor or putting the right prop on it. Not saying that tabs dont work but there not required. Now my cruiser without tabs and you would be screwed, it has to have them.(hydraulic)"
711310,solopaddler,2012-07-03 21:31:00,8605,"  I'm not claiming to be an expert, I'm only relaying my own personal experience with trim tabs. I would never steer anybody wrong.  For what it's worth, and I havn't even mentioned this yet, I've been dealing with a similar porpoising issue with my new 16' Smokercraft Ultima. I have a 75 4 stroke Merc on it and it's basically ran like crap since it's been in the water this spring. Porpoising is the biggest issue.  I've had it at the Merc dealer in Rouyn Noranda since our last trip up.  So far they've adjusted the height of the motor, changed the prop and even installed a wedge behind the motor.   Currently a hydrofoil has eliminated the issue but that's only temporary. I'm 7 hours south and the price they quoted me for trim tabs was ridiculous. I'll take the hydrofoil off next time I'm up and install the tabs myself.  Until then at least the boat is functioning semi normally."
711317,sneak_e_pete,2012-07-03 21:43:00,540,"I agree.  For me, changing motor height, props, etc. wasnt an option.  I have 3 kids under 5 and am lucky to get time fishing let alone adjustments.  $100 and I solved the problem.  Case closed"
711328,lew,2012-07-03 21:59:00,12766,"Mike, I'm no boat expert but I'm wondering if you have a problem with your hull cause it shouldn't be that difficult to get rid of porpoising in a 16' boat.  I purchased a new 17' boat once that would tilt about 45 degrees to port as soon as I hit around 30 MPH. Turned out the hull was hooked near the stern and that was causing the problem.  Dealership ended up giving me another new boat.  I'm wondering if something similar could be causing your problem."
711335,solopaddler,2012-07-03 22:15:00,8605," Don't think so Lew. The inherent problem is simply too much power for the boat imo. (It's a very light boat, and only 16' long)  When the guys had the boat out for a test a few days ago, everything was now fine, but the guy told me the boat was so fast at top speed it was slightly scary.  My old 16' Lund was stupidly fast and porpoising out of control when I first put the 40 on it too. 36mph on the gps..."
711337,Sinker,2012-07-03 22:25:00,8692,How much did the tabs slow you down at a troll? Just wondering.....  I still think its odd that your boat behaves like that. Something isn't right  IMO.  Glad the tabs worked for ya though!  S.
711339,SlowPoke,2012-07-03 22:28:00,2984,"You didn't solve the problem, you merely made an adjustment. ""Case closed"" simply means you may never get the hole shot, top speed and best fuel economy out of your boat. If you're okay with that, enjoy."
711340,lew,2012-07-03 22:28:00,12766,A friend had a 12' tinnie with a 9'9 Evinrude that porpoised like crazy for 10 years. I asked him why he didn't fix the problem and was told it was un-fixable as that's how it came from the dealership  I reached down the transom and flipped the manual trim in 1 notch and the problem instantly disappeared.  The look on his face was priceless
711341,solopaddler,2012-07-03 22:29:00,8605,  In my case absolutely useless in that capacity. I put the pro troller tabs on the Lund and they did virtually nothing to slow the boat down. Total waste of the extra money.  Performance as mentioned was another story.
711343,Sinker,2012-07-03 22:30:00,8692,"Yeah, my boat porpoises like crazy if I lift the motor up one hole too. It doesn't take much to set it up right. I agree that the tabs are just a band aid. That boat should run mint, and move right along, no problem.  s."
711346,solopaddler,2012-07-03 22:37:00,8605,"In my case on both of my boats I had the placement of the motor on the transom changed several times, as well as different props were tried.  Clarence at Bay City Marine was one of the guys who looked at the Lund.  Nothing worked.  For those of you slagging the trim tabs as a band aid, have any of you actually tried them yourself?  Regarding the hole shot comment, any boat with properly installed tabs will get on plane faster and at a slower speeed.  Do you guys know how trim tabs work?"
711348,Sinker,2012-07-03 22:44:00,8692,"Yes, I know all about trim tabs, but I still think a 16ft aluminum should get up on plane and run smooth with no problems. A bigger boat, with a full load of fuel/water/gear, I understand, but a 16ft fishing boat doesn't make sense.  I was hoping the tabs may slow me down a bit. I have a spot between 1.7 and 2.3mph that my boat won't go. I get 1.7 on the electric, and 2.3 on the main....I usually like to troll right in the range I can't get with either  Its funny, I have been in A LOT of 16ft lunds, and they all got up on plane, and ran smooth no problem. Are you sure your hull isn't hooked or something?? Weird....  Sure, the tabs will be an improvement, and I'm glad the OP is happy with them, but I still think there is something fishy with the set up.  S."
711350,SlowPoke,2012-07-03 22:49:00,2984,I was going to ask you that since you're the only guy on the planet with tabs on a tinny.
711351,smally21,2012-07-03 22:51:00,993,"nobody has slagged a trim tab in this discussion. am i reading the same post everyone saying its good the problem is solved? and that they work?  but i agree entirely they are a band aid in this case. trim tabs are to make a working boat run better..this boat came out of the box with a problem. to get it running properly without tabs, then add them would give you the best performance.  I told you so is a comment everyone loves to hear. and its unlikely you are the only guy on the forum who knows how trim tabs work."
711358,solopaddler,2012-07-03 23:15:00,8605, Why don't you ask Clarence at Bay City Marine in Hamilton who installed them for me after exhausting every other avenue.    I wish I'd have consulted you before spending my money having several different marinas look into my porpoising issues.  I could have saved myself a lot of time money and aggravation.
711374,sneak_e_pete,2012-07-03 23:48:00,540,"Hey guys.  Lets get real about something.  True, the boat should run from the get go.  I just dont have time right now to deal with a dealer who is 3 hours away and test a bunch of different things.  I will one day, but for now the smart tabs lets me and my kids get out fishing in comfort.  I could care less about hole shot and top speed (which I think is pretty awesome already).  On plane at 3500 rpm and top speed of 65-70kmph is great in my books."
711396,smally21,2012-07-04 00:21:00,993,"since when were we talking about your issue (with your boat that is)? did i mention anything about your boat or experiences?  if that is what worked for your, great. but as you said yourself, you exhausted all other options first."
706658,DRIFTER_016,2012-06-17 20:28:00,10439, I have said before to put on a pair of Smart Tabs. Best bang for the buck as they only $134 at Cabelas and there is a $10 mail in rebate until July 4th.  Smart Tabs at Cabelas  I would also check motor height as well as angle when tucked in. I have been in boats that just don't handle well at all without tabs though.
706660,smally21,2012-06-17 20:34:00,993,thats no good pete. some great ideas to fix the problem but the boat should run fine the way it is solo and unwieghted...the porpoising and other should occur because you have wieghted the boat wrongly with gear or passengers..you shouldn't need to run with full live wells or pop bottles or patio stones jammed in the bow.  it probably wouldn't porpoise if you left the trailer attached to it either but doesn't solve it!  whats the dealer say? not familiar with the setup are there any settings on the outboard to adjust its angle or height for setup?
706662,DanD,2012-06-17 20:37:00,2223," I agree that if your motor is already down all the way, it needs to be shimmed down. (prop pointing on a more downward angle when trim set fully down) The HP of the (your) motor has the ability and power to still lift the bow past plain and on to the bouncing that you’re feeling. The whole idea of power trim is so that you can compensate for different weight distribution (one two or more people); so adding fixed weight to the front is just a bandage for the root issue. When set up properly you should be able to take off from a dead stop with the trim all the way down; that’s to hold the bow down. Once up to speed, you start trimming up, until you can feel and here a RPM increasing without a throttle change and the boat leveling out. Go past that trim point for the weight in the boat and it will start to porpoise. Your motor (I think) is posibly set to close to water surface level line and you cannot drive the bow low enough under power, to stop it from bouncing. My last boat that I had, had enough range with the power trim that if I was by my self or with four people; I could still plain the boat without porpoising and the only difference was top end speed.  Dan."
706671,sneak_e_pete,2012-06-17 22:18:00,540,Thanks for all of the responses.  I am of the mind that I shouldnt have to add anything to make it run right.  I will see what the dealer says.
706686,Sinker,2012-06-17 23:17:00,8692,"Your right, you shouldn't have to change anything but the trim. I still have a feeling it was those lake erie rollers, but I could be wrong. I'd take it for a run on some smaller water first, just to see."
706698,SRT8 smoker craft,2012-06-17 23:45:00,1107,"I run WOT on erie rollers all the time and my lund is light in the bow TM/starting batteries are in the back You should definately be adjusting the trim once you get on plane . My father in-law was told not to mess with it ""it's not needed"" his boats a 18'6"" bowrider and it always feels like your going to speer a wave because the bow is to low and it ""Falls"" off of the waves and is  porpoising all the time ,scares the crap outta me. I have tried to explain the trim to him but he takes his buddies advice over mine and just leaves it trimmed down all the way and put a hydrofoil on it ."
706707,aplumma,2012-06-18 00:07:00,6896,If you have some one close who knows how to trim out a motor and knows what to feel for it would be worth a 6 pack of brown pop to tempt them out for a blast.   Art
706709,Terry,2012-06-18 00:10:00,14456,"I have never seen a boat porpoising because the trim is down too far  to me porpoising means the bow of the boat is lifting too high {by the power ,the angle, height and prop} and continues to lift till the engine can no longer support the lift and it falls and hits the water again it starts to rise and the cycle continues over and over. trim angle down too much and the thing should get up on plane easy but then the bow will plow through the water and will bounce somewhat on each wave if the right size the engine may not reach full rpms"
706719,sneak_e_pete,2012-06-18 00:42:00,540,"Ya, its hard to explain.  When I was going slower (maybe 2500 rpm) the bow was high, but when I gave it gas the bow just started bouncing big time on each wave.  I got nervous each time and let off the throttle.  My boat before this was a 16 ft with a 40 and I would have run wide open in those waves."
706726,Sinker,2012-06-18 00:49:00,8692," I don't think you even got to the point of trimming up. I think if you'd have kept on the throttle, the bow would have come down, and then you could play with the trim. Sounds like you were almost at the point where you need to start trimming up, but let off the throttle.  Again, its hard to explain.  Getting someone to take it for a rip, who has more experience in a bigger boat would help.  Just hammer it, trimmed all the way down. There is nothing to be afraid of. Once she breaks, and the bow comes down, start trimming up a little at a time until revs come up, with no added throttle.  I don't think this is a porpoising issue. The best thing you can do is run the boat more, and get used to it. Every boat handles differently.  S."
706730,DRIFTER_016,2012-06-18 01:00:00,10439,"Yeah, it sounds like you had not gotten to the point of being on plane. I gather you were running into the waves by the sounds of things. When I used to run my boat on Erie into nasty close together waves I would drive it bow up on purpose. If not you just took too big of a pounding. Anything over 2 1/2 or 3' I would run this way. 2 footers I would just skip across.  Running into waves the face of the wave is much steeper than the back of the wave and this causes the bow to bounce up. Porpoising occurs when you are riding in a swell (on some boats as small as 6"") and the bow bounces up and down like a bucking bronco. Very unsettling (trim tabs get rid of this)."
706736,sneak_e_pete,2012-06-18 01:18:00,540,Thanks so much to everyone for posting.  I will play with it a bit more and see ( without the kids in the boat ).
706749,Skipper D,2012-06-18 02:21:00,1970,Just sent you a pm .
706805,Harrison,2012-06-18 13:23:00,2202,"Just throwing this out, sometimes it is just a matter of finding the sweet spot between speed and trim.  It is a new boat, you may just need to spend a bit more time dailing it in."
706813,beagle dad,2012-06-18 13:34:00,224,my boat does the same thing.. i move weight back..when alone i fill the back livewell with water took porpoise away
707045,Sinker,2012-06-18 22:27:00,8692," This is what I'm thinking too. Don't start changing things, or adding things yet. Run it a few times and get a feel for how it works.  They are all different.  S."
707225,hutch4113,2012-06-19 13:22:00,374,"  Reading the post with interest, as I have the same boat.  The other thing to look at would be the pitch of the prop.  If it is wrong, it will cause some of the issues you are seeing.  The dealer may have installed the wrong size, or may not know what size to put on.  As an example when I bought the boat, it had a 23 Pitch on it.  Since it was used, I am thinking they just threw anything on it.  Horrible to plane.  Also when I had 3 people in it (or the livewell full of water) it would bounce around like crazy.  I am testing out a new prop right now (21P) and will probably go lower (either 17 or 19 - 4 blade Spitfire from Mercury).  My issue is I don't think my RPM gauge is reporting the right WOT numbers  (it shows 6100 at full throttle...at which point the engine should cut out...but doesn't).  From what I have researched the proper pitched prop can make a world of difference (along with the motor being at the right height).  I think my engine is at the height so if you want to compare, let me know (I am in Barrie)."
707288,corvette1,2012-06-19 16:37:00,1765,what hole is the motor in what size prop what rpm at wot
707295,solopaddler,2012-06-19 16:49:00,8605,"I had a horrible problem with porpoising when I maxed out my old 16' Lund when I put a 40 on it.  Even in flat calm water it porpoised terribly. In addition turning and overall performance sucked.  And yes, I tweaked the position of the motor on the transom as well as the prop.  Ultimately I installed trim tabs and the problem was instantly gone as well as enjoying a very noticable improvement in performance.  No more porpoising, on plane twice as fast, higher top end speed and much more control making tight turns.  I wouldn't think twice about it. Install the correct trim tabs and be done with it."
707596,bigbuck,2012-06-20 14:09:00,2449,"It's a brand new package, it should run correctly from the get go, if it does not, it's the dealer's problem. The owner should not have to spend on trim tabs on a brand new boat."
707623,Sinker,2012-06-20 15:35:00,8692,"The boat hasn't even been on plane yet. Let him get it up on plane, and then add some in put.  I think he got to the point where the boat was just about to break onto plane, and he let off instead.  I've never seen an 18ft aluminum boat with trim tabs. I thought Mike added them to his to slow down his trolling speed......  S."
707645,mpt,2012-06-20 16:35:00,158,  From your original pic it looks like the motor is trimmed too far down.  You should be nose diving not porposing. Was the motor position adjusted after this pic?
707654,sneak_e_pete,2012-06-20 17:05:00,540,"Nope, was fully down like that"
707655,sneak_e_pete,2012-06-20 17:06:00,540,Taking it out on Saturday and will let you know how it does
711203,hutch4113,2012-07-03 17:49:00,374, How did it go?  I put a smaller prop on my Pro Mag (had a 23P on it..went down to 21).  Noticed that I have quite a bit more bounce than before.  I am going to go to the new Merc 4 blade prop and will try again.  Should also note I had 4 people in the boat.  Didn't seem to matter where I put them.
706521,sneak_e_pete,2012-06-17 13:06:00,540,"Hi all, got the new boat out yesterday.  Although it was really nice to have her in the water, she was porpoising like crazy once I got over 3,000 rpm.  Although there were some small rollers, I should've been able to open it up.  Not sure what to do.  It was trimmed down all the way.  For reference, its a Smokercraft Promag with a 140hp.  Thanks in advance."
706522,hirk,2012-06-17 13:11:00,571,"Put some weight up front and it should settle down, likely just because your stern heavy right now."
706523,Roy,2012-06-17 13:12:00,13728,"How's your weight distribution, Pete?  Hirk beat me to it."
706525,Handlebarz,2012-06-17 13:14:00,3790,Yep that's what thought also I had to do it with my 14'er years ago put the gas tank battery up front and it settled down  I also added a extension to my throttle out of PVC pipe do I could sit one seat forward it made for some harder turns but worked
706528,mike rousseau,2012-06-17 13:35:00,4661,Yup... Usually a weight issue...  If I remove my bow mount AND battery from the bow I bounce like crazy.... But if I leave the battery up there its ok...
706529,sneak_e_pete,2012-06-17 13:35:00,540,I dont think there is a lot of weight i can put forward.  The only thing movable that I have in the back is the anchor.  The fuel tank is built in and the trolling motor batteries and hidden under the console midway.
706530,mike rousseau,2012-06-17 13:40:00,4661,Did you try getting on plane and then backing off the throttle? That helped when I was playing with my boat weight...  Were you by yourself in the boat...? A second person might be all the weight you need...  Is there a bow livewell by any chance??? If so you could fill it for weight...
706531,muskeybugged,2012-06-17 13:40:00,282,Bilge pumps working?
706532,mike rousseau,2012-06-17 13:43:00,4661,And if all else fails... Fill some 2liter pop bottles and put them in bow storage compartments until it runs the way you want... Then pick up some weights of equal weight to the water... They take up less space...
706533,aplumma,2012-06-17 13:45:00,6896,Bring a buddy who doesn't mind being ballast and have him move around the boat to see if it makes it better or worse. There is a cure for this also involving shimming the motor but that is something that the dealer can help you with if it is needed.   Art
706535,Rob,2012-06-17 13:52:00,467,Try adjusting your trim when you have planes out.
706538,Terry,2012-06-17 14:01:00,14456,If it is really all the way down.   Then you have problems I think you need 15deg shims.  Between your motor and transom your engine may may be too low. Post photo Change prop or trim tabs  dang I hate autocomplete on phones
706547,SlowPoke,2012-06-17 14:32:00,2984,My guess would be two possible causes without knowing all the symptoms... Motor too low. Raise the motor mounts so the cavitation plate is at or slightly above water level when cruising. Boat is too wide for its length and/or aft heavy. Make it longer with a jack plate or trim tabs.  A jack plate may be the right solution as it would address both issues but its not a cheap addition for a 'maybe this will work'

706567,SlowPoke,2012-06-17 15:32:00,2984,"It will get sorted out, I had some issues with mine that make yours look enviable! My motor was mounted to low and I experienced some porpoising but worst of all, they had the hydraulic steering set up backwards. Turn left, go right. Made it fun for trolling and docking."
706568,bushart,2012-06-17 15:34:00,2628,What's that pro mag rated for?  Curious??
706569,sneak_e_pete,2012-06-17 15:39:00,540,Rated for 150
706579,NANUK,2012-06-17 15:58:00,797,Isn't it a brand new boat ?  I would take it right back to the dealer and tell them to make it right.
706601,dave524,2012-06-17 17:08:00,4508," X2, you got 2 forces fighting each other, the hull wants to break free with speed and run on top of the water while the trim down all the way is forcing it to plough, leave it down when you hit the throttle or else you are going to stick the bow straight up, once you are past the point of the bow rising start trimming out, if it is anything like mine, 18 foot Sylvan with a V4 you will feel the steering ease up and not be heavy and the rpm increase slightly. If anyone is stern heavy it is me with a centre console, everything is at the back , fuel, batterys, 9.9 kicker, riggers, nothing at the front but a very large Igloo cooler and some life jackets. You will find you are on the trim a lot depending on speed and water conditions, just remember at displacement speed down is best and trim out as speed increases."
706626,Rob,2012-06-17 18:22:00,467,"Does it has the 24v i-pilot on the front? If not, might be a great opportunityto get one! 2 12v deep cycle batteries will do the trick of adding weight to the front."
706630,SlowPoke,2012-06-17 18:36:00,2984,"Just to be safe, maybe the 36v 101 iPilot"
706642,sneak_e_pete,2012-06-17 19:14:00,540,Has the 24 volt ipilot.  I always thought that trimming up when on plane would make it bounce even more?!
706646,Sinker,2012-06-17 19:48:00,8692,"  Yep, thats correct.  trip up = bow up, trim down = bow down.  If your porposing, trimmed down all the way, you need to lift motor, shim the motor, or put some weight up front.  When you say there was a roll on the water....were you on lake O? I have a hard time running wide open in a roll without bouncing all over the place. A chop is a different story, she will cut thru it, but a roll feels like I'm porpoising.  I'd take it for another ride on a better day to get a proper feel for it.  If you have a livewell up front, fill it up.  Are your batteries for the TM up front?  S."
706650,sneak_e_pete,2012-06-17 19:55:00,540,"I was on Erie10kmh winds, but the waves were rollers.  Tm batteries are located under the console windshield on either side.  I will test it out some more, but to me, I should've been able to go over 3,500 rpm w/ out bouncing like crazy.  Would trim tabs help?  I emailed the dealer to see what they have to say."
706653,Terry,2012-06-17 20:21:00,14456,trim tabs would fix it .but try to fix the problem first
