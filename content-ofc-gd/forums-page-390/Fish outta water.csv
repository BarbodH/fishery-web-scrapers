I'm a new resident to the Milton area and I'm already starting to panic as I am NOT familiar with any of the water out this way. I've heard the middle Grand holds Steelhead and obviously Bronte does aswell...........but what about around  Milton ?......Ive hiked a bunch of the creeks already but im not sure if they are tiny ravines due to the heat wave or raging Steelhead waters in the Springtime. If there is anyone who could point me in the correct direction I'd be more than appreciative. Not looking for  "" the secret spots"" as I'm more than willing to put on hiking boots and scout the creeks personally.....just looking for a push in the correct location as there seems to be alot of tiny creeks and Im a little overwhelmed.  thanks guys/gals"

711925,fishin jesus,2012-07-05 15:15:00,53,THANKS CHRIS.........Yeah i just read all the regulations for the area and got on google earth to get my bearings. can't wait to explore the new turf. starting from scrath again but thats half the fun i guess.
711928,fishin jesus,2012-07-05 15:19:00,53,Thanks Bill........If you had to pick between 16 mile and Bronte ...where would you go first?. I hear a lot of things about Bronte but im just still getting familiar with 16 mile. I went for a drive yesterday to scout out the creeks and both look great.....water is really low i noticed compard to the Eastern Tribs. PM me if you could please?
711935,Christopheraaron,2012-07-05 15:39:00,3525, Neither have very good access however they are very nice rivers.
