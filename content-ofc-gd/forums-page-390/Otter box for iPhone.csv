710760,mike rousseau,2012-07-02 01:13:00,4661,So I just had to replace my iPhone due to water damage....  It was in my tackle bag... And I have the otter box defender case on my phone... Which is supposed to be water resistant...  It rained for 10-20 minutes... That's it...  So for any of you out there using one of these cases... Be aware they have pretty well zero protection against moisture...  From now on my phone and wallet are going in a water tight container and put in boat storage....   Argh!!!!  Mike
710763,pokerdemon4,2012-07-02 01:31:00,135,"That really sucks! What version was it? I use the otter box for mine at work and some play that doesn't involve water. I bought a fanooki thats waterproof for on the water. It's a little bulky but for the price it works. I'm thinking of upgrading to a life proof case. The only thing with these cases are that the phone has to be removed for charging. I picked up a fanooki for 25 bucks on kijiji, shipping included. If your gonna use navionics on the water you should get one. Now if they would only make one that floats. Cheers."
710764,pylon,2012-07-02 01:33:00,68,I like my otter box.  I see zip lock sandwich bags in my future
710770,Handlebarz,2012-07-02 02:21:00,3790,Dang I've been lucky I never thought about keeping my phone like that. Saturday we were taking 3' over the bow and canopy I had my phone just sitting in the cup holder whipped it off and good to go. I think I will start using double zip lock bags
710775,danc,2012-07-02 02:40:00,4677,Just about half of the people that I know with Iphones have cracked the glass on them. No thanks.
710779,DundasSteelheader,2012-07-02 02:45:00,166,"Does the defender case claim to be waterproof? I seem to recall that it doesn't. Sucks either way  I dropped my ipod and the screen cracked, seen many an Iphone share the same fate. Atleast it still functions normally even with a cracked screen."
710781,mercman,2012-07-02 02:55:00,7054,"big diff between water proof, and water resistant."
710790,Cudz,2012-07-02 05:30:00,2652,Call Otter Box.  I kow kids at school call them and tell them their box is broken and they get a new one sent out no questions asked.  They have good customer service. It might be worth a call and see what they can do about the phone

710890,mike rousseau,2012-07-02 15:36:00,4661, Considering it was in a tackle bag in the rain and not DUNKED under water... I thought water resistant should be able to handle that...  As far as screen protection and shock protection... The otter box was great...    I'm just letting you guys know it doesn't help against water at all...
710933,SirCranksalot,2012-07-02 17:43:00,3291,Pelican makes a whole variety of different size waterproof cases. I have 1 for my camera.
711015,Mike the Pike,2012-07-02 23:54:00,3421,when I get in my boat the phone goes in a plastic zip lock bag in storage .I don't answer unless it is urgent or if someone has died.Bottom line Fishing comes b4 answering my phone!!!!!
711028,craigdritchie,2012-07-03 01:05:00,1586,"Yup.  Water resistant = it will leak.  Waterproof = it will not.  Truth is, a paper bag is ""water resistant."" I wouldn't keep electronics in it."

711033,Steve Piggott,2012-07-03 01:20:00,196,"Just by the Samsung Galxey rugby, water proof to 1 meter. Everything in a boat should be water proof."
711073,Sharkbait22,2012-07-03 10:31:00,297, I have the Ruby Galaxy - and it has already been tested - and survived.  No extra cases needed.
711088,Live2fish85,2012-07-03 12:09:00,1633,My Samsung Galaxy has been dunked twice. Fell of a dock up north and it lasted no problem.
