Great day for all...morning with hundreds of perch for the kids on friend's boat and beach relaxation for the wife. Everyone's happy Lost track of the doubles...I used to do lot of perching on Simcoe but doing it for second year on Erie and let me tell you...it is many many times better bite and better/larger fish than Simcoe. Amazing fishery for sure. Got an easy 4 men limit by 11am. Few shots bellow:              Cheers, Ice Fisherman"

711197,Headhunter,2012-07-03 17:42:00,5703,"Awesome Emil! Nicely done... I remember as a kid, my parents would take us to Port Bruce for pier fishing and swimming... some of my fondest memiories as a kid. I'm sure yours will also store those memories away... Be careful thought, if BB gets wind of those Perchies, you may find him following you around! LOL HH"
711302,Joeytier,2012-07-03 21:19:00,3990,Tasty report.  I know what you mean about simcoe perchin.  Too much time spent weedin out the dinks.  You gotta try the Nipissing perchin next winter!
711303,HTHM,2012-07-03 21:21:00,4082,How do you find them? I fish near Port Maitland most of the time and haven't been able to find a feed yet.
711309,CRUD150,2012-07-03 21:28:00,87,Well done!  
711321,sneak_e_pete,2012-07-03 21:45:00,540,"I am fishing out of Lowbanks.  The schools have been HUGE, but not a lot of keepers.  Great job!"
711325,misfish,2012-07-03 21:52:00,29133,I guess BillyBob didnt get them all after all.LOL  Nice feed there Emil.
711362,Rod Caster,2012-07-03 23:18:00,5784, I was thinking the same thing... Although nip doesn't perform that good in the summer.  Looks like an incredible time!!!
