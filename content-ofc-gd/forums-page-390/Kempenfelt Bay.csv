Thinking of heading out towards Georgina Island, etc. but wanted to see if there were suggestions for fishing in the evening, when we are on are way back.  I was out last night, and noticed a number of schools of fish, between 18 and 20 feet - North Shore of the bay, in between Johnson's Beach and the Government dock.  I was running a crankbait at the time (trolling) - perch colous...and did get a slight nibble.  Just not sure what kind of fish it might have been.  I have heard there are Walleye/Pike on that side of the Bay - anyone know if that is true?  The friend I am taking does not get out much, so wanted the day to be succesful.  Any lure suggestions/colours and areas would be greatly appreciated.  Thanks."

711234,NAW,2012-07-03 19:12:00,4022,"There's a decent amount of bass along that north shore.  Also great perch fishing the right time of the year.  I would suggest something that you can get down deep, and bounce bottom for bass.  Blade bait, or a spoon."
