710731,Bernie,2012-07-01 21:46:00,3190,"Got out fishing for the first time in over a month today. My father, brother Mike and I headed down to the French River area for something different. We opted not to do a shore lunch due to possible thunderstorms.  We headed out at 8am into a slight chop out of the north. We tried a spot where we have done well before first thing. Once there we circled the large reef until we found a good drop into 30 ft, headed up wind and tossed the anchor.  I had a fish on as soon as my jig and worm hit the bottom. We tallied 11 in an hour plus one that was in the slot. I also bagged one that was an inch over the slot.    We fished for another hour and a half to get the elusive 12th pickereye but to no avail. The sun was getting too hot to stay any longer. So we pulled anchor and headed for home, my brother at the wheel.    Once back at the cottage we cleaned them up and had a few for lunch. All in all, a pretty good day.  "

710746,Rod Caster,2012-07-01 22:57:00,5784,Nice 60cm + walleye! Can't complain about much on a day like that.
710747,davey buoy,2012-07-01 23:13:00,5505,"Great catch,that river has everything. Hopefully soon I will get up there and give it a go.I still have a couple lakes on the ""davey doo"" list first."

710761,bigbuck,2012-07-02 01:14:00,2449,Been a while since I've seen that many pickeral caught in one outing. Nice job Bernie!!!
710792,corvette1,2012-07-02 08:05:00,1765,awesome day on the water bernie congrats
710860,Bernie,2012-07-02 14:15:00,3190,Thanks guys. Not often they bite hard like that. At one time we all had a fish on. Who gets the net? They shut off almost instantly when the wind shifted slightly. Should have pulled the anchor right then.
710861,Spiel,2012-07-02 14:18:00,9065,"I knew you were holding out on me Bernie.  Glad to see you had a good day out with your brother and dad, hope you marked the spot on the GPS."
710865,Bernie,2012-07-02 14:26:00,3190," Wasn't holding out on you Chris.  We have fished there before, not sure if you were here at the time. We will give it a try in September."
710867,fishnsled,2012-07-02 14:31:00,3520," Holding out on us Chris.  Great day on the water Bernie, doesn't get much better then that."

710876,Leecher,2012-07-02 14:45:00,7832,That's what it's all about right there... spending quality time out on the water with family and catching a good feed of eyes for camp  Good job Bernie and thanks for sharing TJunkie
710978,GBW,2012-07-02 20:49:00,8460,"what, no ugly shirts to make HH feel like he was there?"
711098,Headhunter,2012-07-03 13:06:00,5703,"Way to go Bernie... not fishin in a month eh.... I think we have been to that spot, you caught a nice big gator there last year if I recall correctly... nice you guys got out together and thanks for the report! HH"
711117,johnnyb,2012-07-03 13:36:00,3413,Very nicely done....funny how we will hang around a spot for another hour or so just to get that last fish.....
711375,Nipfisher,2012-07-03 23:48:00,2449,That area (Yes I got a pretty good idea what reef it is) has been producing this year. There was a 34 walleye morning from one boat at our park. Sunday guys went out and only managed 5 with 4 in the slot.
