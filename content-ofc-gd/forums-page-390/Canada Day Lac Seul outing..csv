Of course the long and strenuous task of catching the fish fell to Cliff and myself...oh well. Its a tough job and someone has to do it!  So of we went to Williams Bay from 10am to 2pm. Instead of doing my usual 'milk run' that ends out near the open section of the lake...we headed straight to my favourite deep mark. The reasoning being there was absolutely no wind, no chop, and figured the more active fish would be deep. They did not disappoint.   For at least 2 hours in one spot it was fish after fish at 35'- 40' FOW...mostly nice keeper size. We did get into some shallower on a rocky extended reef/point in 14'FOW but no sooner than they started to bite they seemed to shut off....so we headed back to get our last fish for the cooler at the original spot and ended the day with an over slot double header  Messed around a bit with slip bobbers set at 40' and Cliff went through a selection of plastics that increased in weirdness....they were biting anything. All the big fish were suspended half way up right up to ten feet from the surface in 40'FOW. Without watching the electronics you would not get them. Was like ice fishing for trout....jigging down the bottom...see a fish swim through twenty feet above your jig...reel up to it...WHAM!.....great fun.   We got back and had a decent fishfry, some banter with good friends, went for a swim, watched the Towns firework display and did one of our own before the kids went off to their tent for a sleep over.  We even got a Northern Lights display that evening!   GOOD DAY.   <iframe width=""420"" height=""315"" src=""http://www.youtube.com/embed/5OFg-MmKg4Y"" frameborder=""0"" allowfullscreen></iframe>                                               <iframe width=""420"" height=""315"" src=""http://www.youtube.com/embed/hVkn5WMuEsc"" frameborder=""0"" allowfullscreen></iframe>                                                                    "
