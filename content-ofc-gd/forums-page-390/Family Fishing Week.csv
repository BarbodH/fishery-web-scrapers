This weekend, I will be taking my in-laws out fishing on 6-Mile Lake.  Going to visit the cottage, and hopefully make a nice day out of it.  Then one day next week after work, I am going to take a co-worker out who has been asking me for a few years to take her fishing.  Hitting Simcoe for some perch, or what ever else is bitting.  I never end up catching many fish.  Mostly guiding, putting worms on hooks, and hopefully removing fish for the newbs in the boat!  Is anyone else taking advantage of this free fishing week?  http://www.mnr.gov.on.ca/en/Business/LetsFish/2ColumnSubPage/STEL02_165392.html"

711694,aplumma,2012-07-04 20:48:00,6896,That's a great program I am glad they are doing it. We have a program on the Potomac River were you can buy a boat license for $35.00 a year it allows everyone on the boat to fish under the license even if the are out of State or Country.  Art
