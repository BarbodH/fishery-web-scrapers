710695,misfish,2012-07-01 18:15:00,29133,"The plan for the weekend was to get up to ma and pops for some fishing with my youngest boy(27) and pop. But friday turned out to be a bit of a set back for myself. Some issues with my eyes had me in to see a doc. The out come was alittle heart breaking,so I really wasnt in the mood to go anywhere. But after siting around the rest of the day,feeling crappie,I decided we would head up saturday morning and fish. The only thing is,I cant be fishing when the sun is out at it,s brightest,so an evening fish and a early sunday morning fish,was what we could musture up. Wasnt that bad though. Got my first smallie on the fly popper saturday night,and one this morning, and got to spend some time with my boy.Fish were popping all around. Alot of hits,I was setting the popper to soon.  I thought this made a better report.  Thanks for the help on the converting guys.   <embed width=""600"" height=""361"" type=""application/x-shockwave-flash"" allowFullscreen=""true"" allowNetworking=""all"" wmode=""transparent"" src=""http://static.photobucket.com/player.swf"" flashvars=""file=http%3A%2F%2Fvid1234.photobucket.com%2Falbums%2Fff417%2Fbrianb64%2FMovie_0001.mp4"">     This shot turned out pretty cool.    My boy.     I hope this is nothing that will keep me away from something I just started to fall in love with,but maybe I,ll be forced now,to hit the prime times.LOL  Thanks for reading."
