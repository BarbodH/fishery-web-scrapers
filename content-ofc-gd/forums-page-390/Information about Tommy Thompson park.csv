711371,Riccardo,2012-07-03 23:42:00,12,"Hi, I read that fishing at thompson park is allowed only during the weekend. My question is...If I have a boat or belly boat or canoe can I fishing close its shoreline during all week? If I arrive to its banks from another point I can't see what is the problem... Let me know Riccardo"

711614,whiskywizard,2012-07-04 17:34:00,305,"In the past, the entire park was closed on weekdays because it was still accepting fill. Hundreds of dump trucks a day would roll through there. If you want to be on shore at all, I think you're limited to weekends."
711687,JoshS,2012-07-04 20:21:00,729,I'm guessing you wouldn't have a problem fishing the waters around the park by boat. Goodluck out there!
711711,woodenboater,2012-07-04 22:04:00,2277,"Mind that if you are going motorized, you may need an Inner Harbour License to run those waters. This may be out of date info so check around to be sure. The Toronto marine police are pretty active in those waters from what I remember."
711930,SylvanOwner,2012-07-05 15:21:00,266,The info. above is basically correct.  It's not that fishing isn't allowed during the weekend but ALL public access isn't allowed during the week.  You can however access waters around the park in a boat when launched from a location other than TTP.  Harbour Licence is required for operation of pleasure craft.  Contact the Toronto Port Authority for specifics on this requirement.  Good luck!!
