Put me in a similar situation with live frogs (and fish that consider frogs a delicacy), and every frog will live to see another day. I don't know why that is, but I could never impale a frog with a hook.  Take this guy for example. He was about 1 3/4"" nose to butt. I'd slam the brakes on my truck in the middle of a freeway if I saw this guy hopping across. A mouse, I'd swerve to hit it.  "

711575,cram,2012-07-04 14:55:00,1733,The fish don't recognize it as a mouse.  I'd bet that 99.999999% of the fish that encounter your mouse lure (or live mouse) would have never encountered a mouse in their lives.  Leave the little mice alone and use something else that mimics a vulnerable creature stuck on the surface and you'll do just fine.
711641,johnnyb,2012-07-04 18:30:00,3413,"A live mouse would undoubtedly catch fish.  So would a bird.  Anything floundering around in the water and on top of weeds is an easy meal, and I really don't think any fish is going to analyze what it is.  They see an opportunity and they sieze it.  Ultimately, is a live mouse that practical to fish with?  Not really.....with so many great artificial options on the market, why bother?"

697517,bigugli,2012-05-18 04:42:00,6138,"As kids we used to use mice as live bait some decades back.  We would go out to the boat shed and one of us would chase them out of the stored coils of rope while the other scooped em up with a net. We were going to kill them as a nuisance anyway, so we never though it was a big deal. We'd hook the mouse under the skin unweighted, toss it out on a float and let it swim about. Didn't take long before a big pike was on the line. I'm sure the Humane Society would crucify us today.  Time and attitudes change. You didn't pass up an opportunity to use live bait. You didn't pass on an opportunity to bring home a meal."

697523,Fishnwire,2012-05-18 10:19:00,983," There's no way that catching/keeping frogs is less hassle or easier than bringing in a 6x4x1.5 inch Plano box full of lures...using live frogs is more about tipping the odds in your favour, and less about convenience.  Necessity isn't a factor at all.  Given the choice of throwing artificials all day, or splitting my time between catching frogs and actually fishing...there's no doubt in my mind I'd catch more fish using plastics and plugs.  I don't think the question I asked is ""stupid"".  Suggesting the mouse is ""not dying from being hooked"" on the other hand..."

I remember him bringing a small box with 'feeder mice' from the pet store as well as your average minnows. I think it is fine to use, I have used live mice and frogs before with fantastic results. toss them out weightless and just let them swim around. I don't see it any different than cutting a worm up and putting it on a hook. I guess it really is personal preference, if you don't feel that putting animals on a hook is good they make some great mouse and frog imitators now too!"
697758,GoneFishin,2012-05-19 05:40:00,349," Let's keep in mind bass swallow all of there prey hole, one bite and it's in there stomach, no suffering or anything And if your a P3TA member, then well at least your using the mouse and not wasting it by throwing it in the garbage or compost.  There's many ways your can look at it, but what it all comes down to is your opinion on the subject. Just because you don't agree with it doesn't mean it's wrong, and same goes for for people who think it's right.  Personally I don't have a problem with it and have fed them to pets for a good source of protein and vitamins. I haven't used them for fishing and know that I can catch more fish using artificial bait. Although, I know for a fact you would never get a better source of entertainment then when fishing with a live bait you can see scurrying across the surface of the water, and when it all comes down to it... we all do it for the rush, do we not?  I know people are going to say, it has to suffer on a hook. I guess some people don't realize that hooking a fish isn't that much more ""cruel"" then hooking into an animal, it has just became excepted by society. If people found a way to start hunting fish with guns effectively like they do animals, or hooking and snaring animals like they do fish, would it change anything? It's just the way things are done, you have to be open minded about the situation.  Plus if you are willing to stick mice on your hook on a constant bases, the least of your problems is probably abuse to small varmints :sarcasm:"
697761,Live2fish85,2012-05-19 09:35:00,1633,Lol Hunting for fish is already being done and it is socially excepted.  Guy troll around with bows and line hooked to the arrow and they shot carp. I guess its ok though stabbing an arrow through a fish then fighting it.  I would personally try that to. After working in a slaughter house for awhile things don't bug you much.

You'll also have to stay off my dock, and there's no bed in the camp or seat at the table for you either.   If you've got a problem with me dictating ""bait rules"" when I take you fishing...you're probably not going to like it when I enforce my catch-and-release policy either.

BAM musky on!  Not endorsing this or ever tried it, never wanted to fish this way. Cruel? Don't know, it's a mouse, you decide for yourself.
