710378,lew,2012-06-29 18:47:00,12766, I spent alot of time talking to him about the war Bill and it's unbelievable the horror those guys went thru in the trenches.  Stuff most of us couldn't even begin to imagine.
710425,jedimaster,2012-06-29 22:26:00,3472,"Grab 2 pencils, and put one in each hand and make a fist with the pencil stinking out of your fist between your middle and ring finger... Then extend your pinkies and pointer finger and thumb... Now make a web shooting sound while you alternatively extend your hands out one at a time... And pretend the pencil is the webs shooting out of your hand. This tends to impress the girls aged 7-10."
710426,jedimaster,2012-06-29 22:41:00,3472,"And I made an instructional video for you aplumma....  As for the injuring part, stand up and run around the room and do this and accidentally hit a desk with your web shooter....  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGhkKmeO5RU"
711437,manjo39,2012-07-04 01:25:00,354,Update:  Finally got around to getting an X-Ray as per Doctor's orders.  (Had to go fishing as a priority)  It turns out that the X-Ray showed that I do have a piece of Walleye spike stuck in my finger.  The X-Ray technician is going to call the doctor and let him know.  Who will then send me to a plastic surgeon to get it removed.
711464,SirCranksalot,2012-07-04 01:58:00,3291, A plastic surgeon? Really? So do you have to wait in line behind a bunch of women getting boob jobs??     
711469,fish_fishburn,2012-07-04 02:09:00,1311,"Just another reason our ohip is in the state its in. Better get a specialist to fish that out for you, when any RN can do it."
711489,Sinker,2012-07-04 03:09:00,8692,"Get a razor and cut it out. No big deal. That's all the plastic surgeon is going to do anyways! You will save your time for fishing, and also save the time of the doctors and patients who really need treatment for something more serious.  Geeze...its no worse than a sliver!  S."
711559,jedimaster,2012-07-04 13:43:00,3472, If so take pictures.
711561,SirCranksalot,2012-07-04 13:50:00,3291, .........................and he don't mean of your hand!!
711562,jedimaster,2012-07-04 13:53:00,3472," Yes thanks, I should have clarified."
709694,Stoty,2012-06-27 11:15:00,2910,"Please tell me that you at least got a tasty meal from that little ""prick""!"
709774,manjo39,2012-06-27 16:00:00,354," I would have released it, but the prick meant war. Rolled up the split fillets with bacon and made kabobs for the BBQ."
709813,bigbuck,2012-06-27 18:31:00,2449,What's happening with it?? Did you get it looked at?? Did they cut off your finger and if so I hope you took a video to share......... Let us know because I'm sure a few people have had it happen and would like to know what to look for.
709814,NAW,2012-06-27 19:14:00,4022,"This is just me, but when ever I get a sliver stuck under my skin, i cut it out myself, then treat it with peroxide and polysporin.  I hate the feeling of having something buried under my skin.  It sounds like there's something stuck in there to me.  If you don't like the sound of digging it out your self, then I would go get it checked."
709821,fish_fishburn,2012-06-27 19:54:00,1311,Thats what the doc is gonna do. Save yourself the hassle with the wait and get er done yourself. It happened to me when I reached in the pail to grab one to clean and it kicked and got me. So yeah had a nice snack the next day.
709830,manjo39,2012-06-27 20:35:00,354,"  Tried to dig it out after the first couple of days, but I didn't see anything to dig out.  Seems like a small pin hole with nothing in it. Poured alcohol on it yesterday, polysporin and a bandaid.  Doesn't seem to be getting better.  I dug into it today, but still can't see anything there.  Going to the walk in clinic tonight. Stay tuned."
709831,fishnsled,2012-06-27 20:36:00,3520," I've found that if you cover the stump with gun power and light that up, it cauterizes the wound nicely. A few days and you're good as new...well minus the missing part.  Or you could just pick out the spine and clean it up as fish_fishburn and others have suggested."
709849,Twocoda,2012-06-27 21:32:00,4130,Heres a story for leaving something a little too long....i crushed a finger in the winch loading the boat and thought nothing of it (broke the skin all around the nail) ....but from handling fish time and time again and getting wet each time ....it actually turned into flesh eating disease after 6 days....the fever was terrible and the pain of the infection 10x worse....i ended up in hospital getting the top of my finger removed...the doc said to be prepared to never have a fingernail there again but left a tiny little seed of the thingy thaqt grows nails...ive got a fingernail today but ill never piss around with fish water and open wounds again...  I would get it checked to save yourself from what i went through ...NOT FUN...  Good Luck

709965,mercman,2012-06-28 11:35:00,7054, missed this thread.Shoulda finished my breakfast first
710000,jedimaster,2012-06-28 13:34:00,3472,"I guess they amputated, Manjo is unable to type his update on the finger incident...."
710055,manjo39,2012-06-28 16:06:00,354,"  Latest update:  I went to the walk-in clinic yesterday.  The doc looked at it, rubbed his finger over it and said 'I got good news and bad news ...""  He didn't really say that ...  He said in order to know for sure, he is sending me for X-Rays to see if there is anything stuck in there.  Fish fin/scale/parts etc have calcium and will show up on an X-Ray.  I felt dissappointed, because now I have to find time to go for an X-Ray.  Couldn't he just fix it right there an then.  He didn't want to cut unless he knew for sure.  And if it does have to be cut, he has to send me to a plastic surgeon.  Anyway, hopefully tonight after work I can make it to the XRay, but the kids have soccer and this weekend is fishing time.  Really need to find the time to go for the Xray to know for sure.  Or maybe I just go for a second opinion in the Kawarthas as they might have more experience with fish cut stuff.  Before I left, I asked the doc if I would ever be able to play the piano.  He said if there is nothing in there it will heal in time and yes I will be able to play the piano.  I said Great! because I never knew how to play the piano before!"
710061,jedimaster,2012-06-28 16:48:00,3472,"haha, well hopefully it all ends up well... I guess... I mean I was kinda hoping for some amputation. Better not wait too long. I would think getting it sorted out sooner than later is better."
710063,bare foot wader,2012-06-28 16:56:00,1354,"i had the exact same thing happen to me, except not a fish.....my cat he doesn't like his travel box for vet visits and the very sight of it will turn him into a devil cat and he possess unnatural strength, it's actually unbelievable...ha  he got a claw right on the bottom side of the first knuckle on my thumb, bled a bit but didn't think nothing of it...a week later it hurts like crazy and there's a little bump...i figured the tip of his claw broke off and i tried to squeeze it out but nothing, soaked an exacto blade in alcohol and cut it open, gave it a squeeze, tried digging around with tweezers but there was nothing in there that i could find  gave up on it and eventually a few weeks later the pain ended....3 yrs later i still have a little bump, pretty sure i would've noticed flesh eating disease or anything else by now  i also have a visible piece of pencil graphite in my palm from a grade 2 fight   lol"
710064,jedimaster,2012-06-28 17:02:00,3472,I have a piece pencil in my palm as well from pretending I was spiderman in grad 2 or 3. Haha
710100,chefboi17,2012-06-28 19:14:00,128,"Ahh the good old pencil lead in the palm, mine was from goofing off in class, I think I was stabbing an eraser and the pencil slipped. Yes it was in grade 2 lol"
710101,jedimaster,2012-06-28 19:17:00,3472,"I am not sure if mine is lead or graphite but I would guess it was about 30 years now and is still cleaning visible. I had the pencil between my fingers with a fist pretending to shoot spider webs. I turned around and BAM!!! pencil hit a desk... and stuck into tmy hand. lol come to think of it, it was for sure in grade 2."

710119,Billy Bob,2012-06-28 20:23:00,5865,"You probably don't have ANYTHING in there.....but you DO HAVE infection in there......LANCE it with a CLEAN pin or knife.....but first wash it with alcohol and make sure your tool is disinfected by heating it up on the stove.....then cut or prick it and DRAIN it......then make sure you get some peroxide INTO the wound....it will then heal.......have had to this MANY times to myself or family members....actually quite good at it.....drives my wife crazy when I ""operate"" on myself...LOL"
710209,camillj,2012-06-29 02:53:00,1988,"I always carry a small bottle of Hydrogen Peroxide in my tackle box .. ALWAYS... it seems the farther you get into the backwoods, the more likely a cut will get infected and as several have said this can lead to very BAD things ... anyhow so far I have had 100% success by dabbing the cut (sliver/puncture etc) with a liberal amount of peroxide on a piece of tissue .. then putting a band-aid on it ... you will know its infected already if it bubbles when you do ... by the way this does NOT sting as many fear ... and within minutes it reduces the swelling .. the next morning your red swollen finger will be forgotten ... I NEVER leave home without it."
710354,aplumma,2012-06-29 17:41:00,6896, O.K. I'll bite how do you play spiderman with a pencil and hurt yourself?    Art
710355,Spiel,2012-06-29 17:44:00,9065, Past experiences would tend to have me agree with the above.
710369,lew,2012-06-29 18:26:00,12766,My grandfather fought in the trenches of France during the war to end all wars and had a bomb explode right over his head one day. A bunch of his buds were killed and he ended up with a whack of shrapnel imbedded in his body.  The doc's were able to remove all of it except one piece and till the day he died many many years later you could still see & feel the black lump of metal buried under the skin in his arm.
710373,BillM,2012-06-29 18:38:00,17367,"Lew, I'm sure that lump made for some pretty cool stories."
709447,manjo39,2012-06-26 16:56:00,354,"I got pricked by a Walleye a few weeks ago on my finger.  It went so deep that my finger started bleeding.  Not sure what part went in, but the hole is like a needle went in.  A few weeks later and the scar is still there it doesn't seem to be getting better.  It is very painful that I can't apply any pressure on it (when lifting things etc).  Does anyone know of a (proven) Remedy to make it go away.  Thinking of going to see a doctor about it.  Thanks"
709451,BillM,2012-06-26 17:06:00,17367,"If it still hurts weeks later, you've got a piece of the fin inside."
709452,bigbuck,2012-06-26 17:10:00,2449,"Go see your doc. It's likely what Bill said,you have a piece still in  there and it is probably infected. Get it looked at, in the meantime, soak it 3 times a day in some warm salted water to help draw any infection out."
709489,Joey,2012-06-26 18:46:00,9122,Pour some rubbing alcohol over it and put some polysporin on it and a bandaid for a few days!
709506,Millhouse2020,2012-06-26 19:41:00,152, X2 Good advice.  A sting from pretty much any fishes fins can and will give you an infection or simply cause a leision where bacteria can get in later and cause one.  Their slime has bacteria and so does the surrounding water so its easy for infections to set in once the skin is broken.  If this remedy does not improve the wound in a couple days or if you see puss or fluid you should see a doctor as soon as possible.
709508,lew,2012-06-26 19:48:00,12766, I had my thumb sliced open by a musky tooth one time and ended up with 8 stitches in it. The Doc told me the combination of fish slime & bacteria from the lake water is a very bad combination and to ALWAYS get any serious cut checked by a doctor.
709511,solopaddler,2012-06-26 19:56:00,8605,"It's too late, you've been infected.  The process of change has begun...   "

709524,richyb,2012-06-26 21:10:00,774,I had a pike tooth in my finger for about a month once. I figured it was just infected and kept popping the top and soaking in peroxide until one day I got mad and squeezed it so hard a tooth popped out. That was about 5 years ago and I still have a bump on my finger from it.
709527,funfishing,2012-06-26 21:24:00,147,I thought their slime would have anti-bacterial effects?
709575,wallyboss,2012-06-26 23:34:00,1095,I always have a small bottle of Anti-bacterial gel in my tackle box.  We all know how geting poked by a catfish hurts like hell for a few days.  Well just use the anti-bacterial gel and the pain is gone instantly.  So it would probably do the same with other fish.
709584,mike rousseau,2012-06-26 23:55:00,4661,get it checked...  i know a guy who got blood poisoning from the same situation

709593,DRIFTER_016,2012-06-27 00:29:00,10439,Yep!!! Lop that sukka off pronto!!!!
709595,Roy,2012-06-27 00:33:00,13728, Slime is anti-bacterial to the fish it belongs to. Since we are the intruder AKA as bacteria to the fish...hurting us is what it's supposed to do.

709687,fish_fishburn,2012-06-27 09:59:00,1311,"Same thing happened to me last year. You defenitely have a piece of the spine in your finger. Mine festered up really good after a week then I punctured a hole in it and just started to squeeze the wound till the little  black piece of spine surfaced. I grabbed it with a small pair of tweezers and voila it healed up after a day or two. Hurt like heck for the week it was in there tho. No need to see a doctor, its easy enough to do yourself."
