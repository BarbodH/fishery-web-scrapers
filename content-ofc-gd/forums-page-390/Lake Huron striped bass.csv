711300,CRUD150,2012-07-03 21:19:00,87,"  Just kidding!  The boys did all right too. The big perch were stuffed with cray fish and were hitting rattle raps boucing off the rocks while trolling. Fun day!  Started off down rigging off 5-7 miles off shore in the am and hardly marked a fish. Nuttin for salmon or trout. Switched up for the pm and cought perch, bass, drum and a pike all on a leisurely troll down the shore line. Saved the day for jr. with a good multi species day!  "
