They really are blue!  http://i6.photobucket.com/albums/y227/LICENSETOPIN/DSC04984-Edit-Edit_zps9ri1cgni.jpg~original  Hope everyone had a great weekend despite the weather we had,"

1004472,l2p,2017-05-25 13:12:00,346,"Thanks Misfish, turns out they are just a morph of a yellow walleye even though they are actually blue in color they are not the true blue walleye/pike considered to be extinct!  Still a first for me!"

They were a smaller Sauger like fish with big eyes, never much more than a pound or two. We'd fish them not unlike the deepwater perch fishery of today as they were a colder water species than the Yellow Pickeral. They were only native to Lakes Erie, Ontario and the Niagara River, never were native to any of the inland lakes that cough up the occasional blue morph Walleye.  Edit: it was funny how they were Blue Pickerel in Ontario but cross the river/border to Buffalo and they were called Blue Pike and really they were neither a pike or a pickerel."
