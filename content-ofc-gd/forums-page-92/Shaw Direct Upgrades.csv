I understand that their programming is changing from MPEG 2 to MPEG 4 and I'll need a new receiver too.  Thanks."

The installer changed the entire dish rather than just the head. I think it was because it had a ""Star Choice"" logo on it vs ""Shaw Direct"". Shaw sent us a notice a while back explaining the change over timeline.  It said that eventually our old 500 series receivers would be obsolete.  This series of pages on their site might help.  http://www.shawdirect.ca/english/support/setup-and-how-to/"
1004844,vance,2017-05-29 10:39:00,719,I upgraded my 2 receivers (for free) 3 wks ago and in my conversation with Shaw support they never mentioned any thing about the dish having to be up graded as well and I only have a dual head dish.  vance
