Re-installed the docks for the second time this year, fished for about an hour in the wrong spot. Watched the rain fall for 24 hours. Went to the Kawartha dairy (yay), slept in. Visited the girlfriends dad on Monday and beat them both at crib 2-0.  Not a bad weekend but there was serious lack of fishing."
