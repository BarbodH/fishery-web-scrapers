1004250,John Bacon,2017-05-23 17:57:00,3277,I think they are native to Lake Ontario.  They are definitely known to be in the Lake.  http://www.ontariofishes.ca/fish_detail.php?FID=120

Not sure if they were the same species though. Different species. The ones you saw would be Brook Stickleback (which usually have 5 spines). There are also Ninespine Sticklebacks, and Fourspine Sticklebacks (which are invasive but only found around Thunder Bay)"
