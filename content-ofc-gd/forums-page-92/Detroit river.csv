We had a crew of 3 this time, Drove through some wicked storms out by Chatham and got rained on all day.  Some parts of the river were just shoulder to shoulder. Sort of reminded me of the good old days of opener on the Ganny. Regardless of all that the fishing was great. Lots of big silvers this spring. By noon the arm felt like it was going to drop off. Mo walleye this time though."
