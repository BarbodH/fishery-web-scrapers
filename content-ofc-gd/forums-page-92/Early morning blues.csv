Great time to read up on the ""Moosebunk:, Misfish"" and ""Freshtrax"" while I finish boiling up the last few jars of pickles. Started brining the cukes back at 6:30 yesterday morning. Spent the rest of the day bulk casting jigs. Once the last jars are done I'll be back in the workshop trimming the new jigs."
