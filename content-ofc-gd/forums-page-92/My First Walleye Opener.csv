1004269,moxie,2017-05-23 20:38:00,1566,Sweet ! Congrats and remember it gets better for a few weeks yet.
1004282,PUMP KNOWS,2017-05-23 21:44:00,937,"Thanks guys.  On saturday night we went back and I was able to catch a over slot and a small slot size.  Not bad for a novice walleye angler. I did notice not that many people catching, maybe the water is still too high?   saw the IG post...  not too shabby, especially from shore! well done mang  What's your Ig?"
1004301,Weeds,2017-05-23 23:17:00,782,What did you manage the other carp on?  Just curious.
1004302,Musky Plug,2017-05-23 23:18:00,398,Nice looking walters right there. Good stuff!
1004318,PUMP KNOWS,2017-05-24 01:13:00,937,"What did you manage the other carp on? Just curious.  My first fish of the night was that carp and it was on a orange/yellow reef runner.  It's funny how it happened, I was telling my buddy how I couldn't feel the bottom so he gave me his setup with that lure.  First cast... I tell him yup I can feel the bottom... then I feel a grab... ""Fish On!""  I gave back his setup after and I start catching all my fish on the other lure."
