1003732,LittleWorm,2017-05-17 03:10:00,122,"Well I finally managed to get out for the first time this year. Went to Bennett lake with my wife and dad , went looking for Walleye and Pike but did not have to much luck with them. I caught a small Pike I released and my wife caught a decent one that my dad kept. I did manage to catch 5 nice bass ( I know, out of season and they all went back ) and a nice Crappie. I know what bass season opens up where im going to try to head to! Besides  the 5 I caught I had 4 get off right at the boat. Ill see if I can figure out how to post multiple pics, if not Ill post them individually .  Be warned, my ugly mug is in these pics, God did not bless me with good looks. View at your own risk!"

1003774,BillM,2017-05-17 15:18:00,17367,"Good job, just an FYI though, I wouldn't be taking pics with OOS fish and posting them anywhere online.   I know you're excited but you don't want to get yourself in trouble."

I know you're excited but you don't want to get yourself in trouble. I will remove the pics of the bass, they were the first two I caught and took a quick pic of each before release."

1003842,Old Ironmaker,2017-05-18 00:10:00,8243,We are a tough bunch here LW. Keeps everyone on their toes an up to snuff on the law. Some laws we just make up. Your first mistake was posting a pic in the first place. A newbie recently was chased off after his first post and he posted a photo. Never been back since I believe.
1003844,LittleWorm,2017-05-18 00:25:00,122,I figured a pic of my mug would scare even the bravest away!

1003898,PUMP KNOWS,2017-05-18 20:06:00,937,That's a nice size crappie
1003901,LittleWorm,2017-05-18 20:16:00,122,He was 12 inches but I do not know how much he weighed as I could not find my scales. I'm thinking he was right around the 1 pound mark.
1004109,danteiv,2017-05-22 02:25:00,28,nice catch! havent caught any crappie myself this year
