1003185,Old Ironmaker,2017-05-13 11:23:00,8243,"If it is a human, and I think it is, remind me not to go there. The Wikipedia article sort of answered my question when I read that there are 1800 different genus of Black Flies.  Who are these people that know that and dedicate their entire scientific careers to find that out including he fact 4 of the species are now extinct?"
1004211,4x4bassin,2017-05-23 14:24:00,1025,Just got back from a camping/fishing trip in this general area and I can say the blackflies are out in full force . Swollen/itchy hands are in full effect today !!! Skeeters were even out buzzing around which was surprising . Its going to be a bad couple months coming up for biting bugs me thinks.
1004309,Pikeslayer,2017-05-24 00:09:00,1443,"As I sit here in a screened in porch somewhere in Seguin, I see a massive cloud of blackbastards hovering over the warming Q 20 ft away. I will need to suit up while tending the steak, retreat to the screened in porch, spray bomb & unsuit before opening the door to the cottage. Worst fly season I've seen in seven years here. But totally worth it  Despite winds, rain, bugs & babysitting newbies, best opener ever !! Everybody landed pike & walleye. Mostly walleye"
1004383,AKRISONER,2017-05-24 18:28:00,5558,the deet was doing its duty this past weekend. When she was calm there were clouds of the buggers...but i didnt even end up getting bit one time. Praise the lord...i dont think i will be so lucky in a couple of weeks time.
1004434,guastels,2017-05-25 01:51:00,22,We are on Otter Lake in Parry Sound and the Black flies have been brutal.  Need to walk around with a head net on.
1004579,fish_fishburn,2017-05-25 22:30:00,1311,I showed a waterfront property yesterday and the mosquitos were something awful. Going to be a bumper year in the Ottawa valley.
1002949,Newguy38,2017-05-11 17:54:00,11,"Need help, anybody been near Parry Sound/surrounding area and know if the black flies/mosquitos are out yet?  Any report would be greatly appreciated.  Thank you!"
1002951,grimsbylander,2017-05-11 17:56:00,3016,"Yes, lots and huge. lol It's Parry Sound!!! Kidding, I don't know really."
1002952,AKRISONER,2017-05-11 18:04:00,5558,"just starting...when it was cold last saturday there was none, but then the sun came out and the winds died down on sunday and sure enough the buggers were out. couple mossies, but the black flies are gonna be absolutely ridiculous this year with how wet everything is.   but simple answer, yes they have started...nowhere near their peak yet but its coming."
1002959,Newguy38,2017-05-11 18:43:00,11,@AKRISONER-appreciate the response.  Going up soon and preparing for the worst.  Last year was awful; the heat and bugs at the end of May produced a cumbersome environment for fishing on the shores.  Are you near Parry Sound or surrounding region?

Pointe au baril bud  if its between May 24 and the july long weekend, its a gong show. once the blackflies go towards the end of june i.e. bass opener, then the mosquitos will be absolutely horrendous. Trying to fish at dusk requires something to cover your mouth so that you arent chewing on the damn things.  Your only hope is to get somewhere that its windy during the day to get away from the black flies...dont feel ashamed wearing a bug net, anyone that calls you a wimp doesnt know how extreme it gets. unless you like bugs constantly going into your ears nose eyes and mouth there is no shame in a bug net during black fly season."

Thanks again! Never been there, anywhere in cottage country is incredible.  We use heads over our head every year when opening up the cabin....only way to be outside.  Appreciate all the info."
1002985,Beans,2017-05-11 20:59:00,3339,There were scads of them at the shoreline of Pigeon Lake this afternoon...fortunately they wern't biting but still made a nuisance of themselves getting in our eyes and ears...Gotta remember to put my bug jacket in the back of the car...
1002989,irishfield,2017-05-11 21:39:00,26272,I can tell you categorically.. you'd better have a bug hood or lots of alcohol in your system. After spending 8 hours outside today I can tell you they are the worst that they have been in a good decade.
1002993,cheaptackle,2017-05-11 22:24:00,849,"Inundated with blackflies on north shore of Balsam today, till 2 light showers came through this afternoon and the skitters came out after - ended up eating or snorting a bunch while building a deck, got wet then attacked by skitters.  Wasn't expecting or prepared for them at all.  Big can of Muskol coming in with me tomorrow!  Michael"
1002999,Pikeslayer,2017-05-11 23:08:00,1443,"Thx for the categorical confirmation Wayne. With the wet & late spring I'd figured we were in for an epic blackbastard season this year in Seguin . As alcohol is not an option for the grandkids 2-6 yrs, looks like I'm shopping on Amazon for full body armour for them. Keeping them home is not an option as the other Grampa has got them revved up for a cottage visit ."
1003011,Dara,2017-05-12 02:45:00,3052,Y'all should prolly just stay in the city

1003022,fishindevil,2017-05-12 10:03:00,6254,blackflies are out in the kawarthas right now they were bad last night in the driveway while I was rigging out the lund........

Everyone is saying they are awful this year, but at least it won't be 75 degrees with massive amount of bugs, like it was last year."
1003041,the spirit of fishing,2017-05-12 13:30:00,141,"I often use the thermocell units and find they work really well. Takes a few minutes to establish your ""safe bubble"" and then the bugs seem to disappear. Not really suitable to use while you're moving but once you're settled down they work as advertised."

I remember going for a swim after dark there once in mid summer, it was the only time I tried that.  lol the first couple seasons with the cottage were a nightmare for me...including one that crawled down my pants and bit me on the unit...was not comfortable to say the least...I also blew up with over 50 welts all over my body. Having been up there for 15 years through the thick of it, the mossies and blacks nip but I dont react like i used to.  Still a friggin pain in the but when they get you behind the ears...drives me nuts."
1003051,4x4bassin,2017-05-12 14:31:00,1025,"The blackflies started coming out a couple days ago just inland from Parry Sound and have really not started to bite yet but it won't be long . No skeeters yet . Things are still a bit cool up there and I believe the flies and everything else are a bit behind . With the warm weather coming next week I'm sure they will be out in full force by the long weekend . I have spent a lot of time in that area and I find that it can depend where you are and how bad the bugs are . I have been in the Mckellar area and it is crawling with blackflies meanwhile go to a couple lakes just north of there on the same day and there is nothing .  As for the thermacells , I use them and I believe they do help a bit . Worth the $40 in my opinion ."

1003159,Old Ironmaker,2017-05-13 00:41:00,8243,"Can we categorically identify the species of flies that are in Parry Sound? I have in my earlier life been as far away as Long Lac area and Labrador. Just last year was my first experience with Parry Sound/Point Au Barril ""Black Flies"". We have bugs on Erie they call Black Flies, they are not, they are May Flies. Big buzzing critters that will turn my white boat seats and white T shirt red with blood when squished. They do not bite, they bug and that's it. The things in Long Lac, the Ottawa River near Pembroke and Labrador are the size of mosquitos, buzz and bite and I have a reaction and need Benadryl , if bad I need to go to the ER and get a shot. Eventually when we went to camp on the Ottawa I got an Epipen. The so called Black Flies I swallowed in Point Ah Barril were 4 times the size and buzzed but did not bite. They in my opinion are not Black Flies, too big, don't bite, don't make me sick. Maybe a strain but not the small biters we have north of southern ON. Please educate me."
