I'm looking for 14x4.25x3/4, needs to be bigger to cover some scratches lol.  I've called a few places and none would do it. Would only sell a whole sheet. Boat Outfitters, an online store will do  it and ship from the states, but I figured I'd try local first. Thanks!"

1003997,Musky Plug,2017-05-19 23:00:00,398,P&A plastic in hamilton can custom make what you need. They have fairly cheap prices too.
1004029,lifeisfun,2017-05-20 21:30:00,99,Homesense 3/4 plastic cutting board then cut it to size You will have enough material for many of them for $9.99
1004171,BassMan11,2017-05-23 00:27:00,583,Exactly. Then use 3M 5200 to mount it to the back of the boat. Worked like a charm for me.
1004200,Fishwilly,2017-05-23 11:33:00,206,Just installed a board this weekend with 3m 5200. That crap is a nightmare. It was so damn runny....i read where Premium PL is better. Last time i use the 5200 stuff.
