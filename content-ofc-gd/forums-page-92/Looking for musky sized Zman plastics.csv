I have never seen any musky size , they are really made to target bass but I also use them for pike .  The thing  with them is you have to be careful, you can not let them sit in your tackle box (tackle box's ) with other plastics as they will melt to them so you always need to keep them separated from other plastics. Other then that they are great, they float and have really good action to them. their chatterbaits work well also .I order mine from Bass Pro Shop when they go on sale.  Oh, and Canadian tire now carries them also."
