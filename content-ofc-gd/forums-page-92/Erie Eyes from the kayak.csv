1004144,blaque,2017-05-22 15:42:00,2419,"One of my favorite times of the year.  Light gear, long lines, and a box of shallow running stickbaits. Rod in hand and a direct connection to the strike. So much fun, lots of good eater size eyes, and an occasional SLOB thrown in there to keep it exciting  Walleye tacos with a cilantro lime sauce as a reward for all my ""hard work""          "

1004174,can u fish,2017-05-23 01:10:00,326,That is awesome nice eater size walleye on Erie out of a Kayak who would of thought thanks for the report.  Cheers Mitch

Smaller fish than the offshore population than suspend over deeper water, you could probably launch a yak from Nickel Plant Beach and fish it."

Dipsies, Jets, Planer boards, runnin 4 rods, draggin fish in with the boat under power, not my cup of tea lol"

Dipsies, Jets, Planer boards, runnin 4 rods, draggin fish in with the boat under power, not my cup of tea lol  Actually we got those all summer just off that wall, I always thought they were a separate local population that stayed there, smaller fish typically than you got offshore. With the predominate winds we either trolled or pulled up to the marker just east of the foghorn and drifted back towards Nickel Plant Beach casting Erie Dearies tipped with a bit of crawler. In season a mixed bag of Smallies and Eyes was assured."

About 5 years ago I caught a 4lb walleye on a spinnerbait in 6' of water on the inside of that breakwall... I think it was lost!"
1004273,captpierre,2017-05-23 21:00:00,2521,Honestly. I can't believe you go out on Erie on one of those And with spring water temps ???? More balls than I've got
1004277,misfish,2017-05-23 21:33:00,29133,"Simcoe is 49.5. Loads of yakers out, even a couple of toons. LOL"

Dipsies, Jets, Planer boards, runnin 4 rods, draggin fish in with the boat under power, not my cup of tea lol I'm on Erie WITHOUT any of that crappola and get my fair share of walleyes all year long by just drifting worm harnesses, even out to 75' of water."

I can't believe you go out on Erie on one of those And with spring water temps  More balls than I've got  Its really not that risky.......We arent very far off shore, watch to make sure the weather is gonna be stable for the evening, and its all good."

Obviously doesnt cover as much water, but if ya find em......again, its the more enjoyable way to catch them summer walleye"
