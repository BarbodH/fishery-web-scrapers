Is there anyone from the area that can let me know what the conditions will likely be (water temp, water levels, weed growth, etc.)?  I'm not that familiar with the lake and have only ever targeted bass, which I know are out of season. So we’ll probably target pike and/or Lake Trout. I don’t imagine the lake has many weed beds so any tips regarding pike patterns would be appreciated. For lakers, any info on depths to target would be appreciated…we’re not into trolling that much but might do it to break up the day.  Thanks in advance—just looking to narrow down some patterns to increase our chances of success!   Norm"
