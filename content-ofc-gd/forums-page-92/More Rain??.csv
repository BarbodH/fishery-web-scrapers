Oh and east winds for good measure. So now the forecast shows the possibility of rain for 5 of the next 7 days! In previous years, I'd ignore the rain forecasts but this year were getting it big time!! Here's hoping June is different."

Water in 2014 here, was up 24ft. Yeah, sounds retarded, but it was darn near catastrophic stage  According to the water testing, that was the highest it was in like 98 years."
