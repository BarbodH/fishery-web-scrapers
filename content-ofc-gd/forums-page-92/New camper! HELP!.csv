1004008,pike slayer,2017-05-20 02:11:00,1177,"Hi guys, I just bought a 2006 jayco baja tent trailer. I loaded it up with my 4wheeler on the front deck and I have Wayyy to much weight on the tongue of the truck. It just about bottoms out my truck. Would a weight distrubtion hitch help enough? Or what else can I do? I have a 2004 nissan titan. https://www.jayco.com/tools/archive/2006-baja-ct Theres the specs I have the 10y. My 4wheeler weighs 700lbs.  "
1004010,OhioFisherman,2017-05-20 02:22:00,6623,"Just from the pictures?  Your trailer axle isn't positioned for you to put a 700 pound load on the front deck, all that weight is going on your truck."
1004012,pike slayer,2017-05-20 02:27:00,1177,Exactly all the weight goes on the tongue. What do I do to help get weight off the truck?
1004013,OhioFisherman,2017-05-20 02:48:00,6623,http://www.reeseprod.com/products/weight-distribution/round-bar-wd/xDqAUvNOHeKF!ZRNNWEMq|1ysdr6LjWs  I don't know if adding air bags to your rear suspension will help.
1004014,DRIFTER_016,2017-05-20 02:50:00,10439,Weight distribution hitch will help a lot. If after installing one it's still heavy on the vehicles suspension add a set of air bags and you'll be good to go.
1004015,Gallie,2017-05-20 02:50:00,1215,"Its an interesting setup, can you put the 4 wheeler in the back of the truck and throw some other stuff on the trailer? Id bet the truck would ride way better that way."
1004016,DRIFTER_016,2017-05-20 03:02:00,10439,"It's a toy hauler pop up camper. It's made to haul a 4 wheeler or dirt bikes on the front. Yes they are tongue heavy, therefore one installs a load distribution hitch just as you would when hauling a heavier bumper tow hard side camper. My buddy has a 21' hard side and pulls with a 1/2 ton. He picked up an equalizing hitch and it's much better."

Id bet the truck would ride way better that way.  Yeah , way too much weight on the tongue regardless of the truck suspension, not going to tow well. Getting 4 wheeler in the box ahead of the axle would help and put the displaced stuff in the box in the trailer if possible.  I doubt you could move the axle on the trailer enough to compensate."
1004018,pike slayer,2017-05-20 03:12:00,1177,Ya that's what I did for this weekend. I put my atv in the box of the truck and tossed all my junk on the camper cargo deck and it did make a difference. But ya I want to correct the problem so I can haul it with the atv on the deck so I can put my junk under my tonneau cover to keep it out of the elements. I'm pretty sure my work has a weight distrubtion hitch. I might borrow and see if that does the trick.
1004028,Fisherman,2017-05-20 19:09:00,7201,"Empty tongue weight of the trailer alone is 225lbs, add the atv 700, you may as well say 1000lbs.  You need a WDH at minimum."
1004030,Weeds,2017-05-20 22:04:00,782,Are trailers built like that as a factory option or is that almost always a custom home job alteration?

1004032,davey buoy,2017-05-20 22:49:00,5505,"Just looks like to much area for a couple jerry cans ,a cooler and lawn chairs for example.Maybe that is all it's for?"
1004034,dave524,2017-05-20 23:47:00,4508,"I was always taught the tongue weight should be 10 to 15 % of the trailer weight   edit: I know from personal experience that too light a tongue weight will cause a fishtailing condition, forget the symptom of too heavy a tongue weight."
1004035,Weeds,2017-05-21 01:42:00,782,Thanks for the link. That's a pretty sweet pop up. I can't recall ever seeing one with set up with a front cargo area like that although perhaps I have and was just oblivious to it.  
1004039,glen,2017-05-21 03:33:00,2641,Pack all your heavy gear at the back of the trailer.  Can you put a small atv on the back. Lol.
1004040,Dara,2017-05-21 03:52:00,3052,Sweet trailer. Did you get than from the guy down queen St. Equalizer hitch should work.  Gotta love the ground clearance in that trailer.  I always wanted one. Check the specs on what you Can put on the deck too.   That should balance better than that I think
1004311,pike slayer,2017-05-24 00:23:00,1177,Hey Dara I didn't get mine on queen st but I did see it on Kijiji. I got mine out in heyden. It's like identical. I really put it to the test this last weekend going up into mashagama going through wash outs and bouncing it off rocks. 
1004327,Dara,2017-05-24 02:08:00,3052,Nice setup. How was fishing
1004335,pike slayer,2017-05-24 02:36:00,1177,Fishing was slow. 2 lakers this size Saturday and I went out for an hour or so Sunday avoiding raindrops and got one more that size. Even though the weather didn't cooperate it was still a good time with the wife.
