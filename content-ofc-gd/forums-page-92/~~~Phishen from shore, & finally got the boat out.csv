Park. the Boat ramp was closed, but the docks were open for phishen. So we got set up to terrorize some pan phishies, and we had a blast, set up with a slip bobber, and small hooks, baited with some Wax Worms, and we tagged about 50 Perch Sunnies, Rockies, and some Crappies, and we left there just a few seconds before the rain started again. Come Monday buddy Cuong and I headed up to Lady Simcoe launching out of Sibald Prov, park. the boat ramp the water was almost to the top of the ramp, made for easy launching, very few boats out there, We headed over to the Whitie Grounds about 7 boat in a wide area, marked some phish in the area, lots of bait, but no hits. Move over a spot between Fox, & Snake 24' of water for some Perch, mega schools but all Dinks. took off back over to Georgina phishen inside the bay just off the Government Dock area 9' of water, we found some good size Perch in the 9"" range, we just got comfortable, went some twit up high, said your having it too good here some high winds to make it a challenge. and he also turned down the temp. so fought our way back to the ramp, and came home, was great being out in the boat again first time this year, and with the crack welded, she didn't leak. hoping next weekend weather permitting  be out there again    "
