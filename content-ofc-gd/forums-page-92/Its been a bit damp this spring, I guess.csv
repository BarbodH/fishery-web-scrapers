Not seeing a lot of bait this year either ... 5 hours this morning only saw 1 bait ball. Sure hope things return to normal soon"

Water was high in the 80's  and my 18 footer just cleared if I put the antenna and rods down, the water is 6 to 12 inches higher than that now .   http://images.ourontario.ca/lincoln/57571/data?n=3"

1004319,pics,2017-05-24 01:17:00,1268,The harbour is stilted in so there's not much water.. The Niagara Conservation Authority now owns it. I am not sure if it's happened yet but the plan is to provide a canoe launch..

Was also a pretty decent place for icefishing for pannies in winter about the same time, still a decent place for carp and cats. The NPCA owns the old marina ,I understand they enforce a no gas outboard policy now."
