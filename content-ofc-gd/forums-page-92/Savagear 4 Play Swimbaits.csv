1004294,Musky Plug,2017-05-23 22:51:00,398,"I got to try the lure out yesterday for a few casts.  It has a clean swimming action to it and I find it also has a nice wobble to it as well.  I didn't have any follows but I do see this lure catching me fish in the right conditions.  I was talking to a person who owns these lures and he told me to watch out for the plastic tail.  He mentioned how the two plastic points would break off.  Anyone have the same problem?    Nope, hasn't happened to me"
1004366,mark demmery,2017-05-24 15:07:00,68,I've never had an issue with the tails. I actually just broke the lip off the original one i bought when they first came out.... it was my fault tho...  Overall I'm impressed with the quality. Mine have taken a beating over the years.... 
1004429,PUMP KNOWS,2017-05-25 01:30:00,937,Sweet battle scars on those lures.  You can probably still use that lure with no lip and use it as a wake bait.  I believe they sell the 4play without a lip too.
446353,mbosh1980,2010-03-22 15:42:00,349,"Picked up a 14cm firetiger hard swimbait from one of the ""impulse buy"" bins at bps this morning.  Was wondering if anyone has used them and for what species?  They have a couple vids on youtube and the action looks good but I'm having trouble finding reviews for the product. Thanks"
446431,uglyfish,2010-03-22 17:51:00,981,  never heard of them to be honest. can u put up a couple pics so we can have a look?
446495,mbosh1980,2010-03-22 20:12:00,349,http://www.savage-gear.com/ thats the website.  The 4-play bait is on the left side. Thanks for the response.
446779,mikeh,2010-03-23 02:33:00,824,"I also bought one, for the price I think they are a pretty good deal. They should be good for bass and pike."
446818,adempsey,2010-03-23 03:10:00,1498,"They definitely looked nice to me.  I almost bought one...you know, one of those put it in the basket and after 1 hour of shopping I had so much stuff I had to start putting some things back.  The Savage lures didn't make it to the checkout.  Of course, the sale is still on......"
447481,rbaquial,2010-03-24 08:01:00,968,Checkout Youtube - There are a lot of videos on the Savagear Lineup! Pretty awesome action on these things...
447555,mbosh1980,2010-03-24 13:21:00,349," yeah, I saw those. Looks pretty good. Can't wait to try it out."
448038,rbaquial,2010-03-25 15:53:00,968,"I went to Lake O yesterday, just to test them out - pretty awesome action in these things!"
448110,Cudz,2010-03-25 20:47:00,2652,I too bought one.  THe quality looks great and I hope they can help me catch some toothy critters.
448391,Fishboch,2010-03-26 13:05:00,9,Just got the latest edition of Musky Hunter magazine and Rollie and Helen's Musky Shop has an ad for Savagear baits.  Go figure.  Guess they just didn't sell well up here for some reason.  Looks like you got a good deal.
448403,rbaquial,2010-03-26 14:17:00,968,Does anyone have an idea how much these things would 'normally' go for?
448476,mbosh1980,2010-03-26 18:25:00,349, The musky shop has them for $13.99 usd.
1003863,PUMP KNOWS,2017-05-18 13:25:00,937,"Anyone have any success with the 4 play?  I recently ordered the 7-1/2"" version on sale.  I've been very fascinated with swimbaits this year and started to pick up a couple different swimbaits to try out.  http://www.cabelas.ca/product/77280/savage-gear-4play-herring-liplure"
1003864,manitoubass2,2017-05-18 13:36:00,11391,First time ever hearing of them.  I bet that pike pattern would be deadly in shallow water at evening for pre/post spawn walleye
1003868,Acountdeleted,2017-05-18 14:36:00,2562,Heh. Cool. This is another lure I want to pick up just to show off. Looks really cool.

1003932,adempsey,2017-05-19 01:34:00,1498,"Have a bunch I plan on trying very soon.  Mostly the soft plastic ones, but have some hard lures too.  Best prices for me were from the UK."
1003942,Musky Plug,2017-05-19 03:34:00,398,I have both the lipped and lipless version. Both are pretty good but I seem to better luck with the lipped lure. They have got me some pretty decent pike and bass. I haven't tried the soft plastic versions though.

Retail on these are expensive. For the hard lures, about  $14CDN each total for the 19cm/7.5"" ones shipped to my door.   Exchange rate has been getting worse though, so probably about $15 now.  Still cheaper than the $20+tax retail."
1004209,mark demmery,2017-05-23 13:54:00,68,"I've had great success with these for pike. lots of different ways to fish it, but the fish will dictate how they want it of course...  slow and steady, burned over weeds, or similar to a jerk bait. I find a lot will hit when i give it a 2-3 second pause. From local lakes, to Toronto Island to the Kawarthas, its one of the first lures i throw for pike. Bass seem to like it too...  Def worth having at least one in the arsenal...lol"
