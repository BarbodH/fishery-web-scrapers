1004216,Tjames09,2017-05-23 14:48:00,664,"Looking for a somewhat technique specific rod, for bass and walleye. Would be used for vertical jigging, ripping hair jigs, shaky heads. I have another rod Ill continue to use for t-rigs, wacky rigs, and drop shotting.  Not sure to go with fast or xfast. I find the kawarthas weeds pose a problem for fast tip and it often isnt enough stout to pull the lure through the weeds effectively."
1004219,manjo39,2017-05-23 15:12:00,354,"I find its not the action/taper that is the key for ripping bucktails, its more the power.  I use a 6'6"" fast action MH to rip through the weeds.  For jigging on the edge (not through the weeds) then a fast, M is good.  For Bass in heavy cover, I use a baitcaster for accuracy and stronger drag to get the fish out."
1004238,OhioFisherman,2017-05-23 17:02:00,6623,"Falcon rods used to make a flipping stick for spinning reels, 7' 6"" telescopic, spinning rod handle and eyes, probably based on a casting rod blank. The one I have is rated for like 3/8 to 1 1/2 ounce lures, a good rod for fishing slop."
1004256,Tjames09,2017-05-23 18:54:00,664,"Sorry, this was more meant for walleye then bass. I have a casting rod setup for flipping heavy jigs into cover. this was for light jigs/vertical jigging and hair jigs."
1004258,porkpie,2017-05-23 19:08:00,2521,For what it's worth I use a fast action 6 foot rod for vertical jigging or tossing ball head jigs.  I don't know if it's better or worse than any other but it works for me.  I fish everything from light 1/8 -1/4 ounce jigs to 3/4 ouncers when I go to the Detroit River. It seems to do the job!
1004304,Musky Plug,2017-05-23 23:27:00,398,"If you're going to use just for ripping jigs/ jigging, personally I would use a med power fast action rod around the 6'6"" mark. XF might be to soft of a tip."

I have a casting rod setup for flipping heavy jigs into cover. this was for light jigs/vertical jigging and hair jigs.  Actually I spent a lot of time using small baits like 1/8 ounce hair jigs, the reason for that rod and this reel?  http://i60.tinypic.com/rct4ig.jpg  I could put 17 - 20 pound test mono line on it and still cast very well with a small, light lure, the heavier rod gave me the power to pull bigger fish out of junk."
1004324,buick14,2017-05-24 01:54:00,741,"6-6'6 m xf If using croix , feel the rod out as they can be stout in those ranges.  You won't be happy with a F unless u like that tip pop and microsecond loss of connection with your bait (vertical jigging).  I don't mind it though."
1004360,manjo39,2017-05-24 14:06:00,354,"You need two different setups for vertical jigging vs. ripping.  Ripping requires a more stout rod, the taper doesn't matter as much because you are ripping up vigorously every time.  For vertical jigging the XF taper will help as Buick14 mentions.  I would recommend you start with a vertical jigging rod and try it for ripping as well.  Then try your bass rod (baitcast will work) for ripping as well to get a feel for what think would be best."

1004636,Garnet,2017-05-26 13:47:00,2056,"I use a 6-6 medium baitcaster Xfast 7:1 curado 20 lb braid with flouro leader.  Same rod I throw poppers, walk the dog, spinnerbaits with.  When I used spinning 6-6 medium x fast and same line combination."
