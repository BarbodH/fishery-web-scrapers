This morning was a quick snatch and grab for the whities  , then it was a long morning of washing spoons. Both Terry and I went through pretty much our go to,s and our , lets try these spoons. Even tried to jig over a pod we found late . Nada.  We are eating fresh fish tonight,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,    "

1004812,LittleWorm,2017-05-28 20:40:00,122,"Nice video man. I don't think I have ever seen anyone hold a rod like that to reel in a fish in my life. Oh, It looks like you got yourself a great net man, hang on to him. A great net man is even harder to find than a great woman!"
1004814,misfish,2017-05-28 21:37:00,29133,"Nice video man. I don't think I have ever seen anyone hold a rod like that to reel in a fish in my life.   Not sure how I got to holding my ice rods that way. Might be related to the way I hold my pin,fishing the river. Might even be cuz It feel right  to me.  I have tried to hold it ""normal "", if there is a normal way to hold. LOL"
1004832,Moosebunk,2017-05-29 03:14:00,3970,I may have already tried downloading and playing with the free Movie Maker (latest  version) and it was still too tough for me.  Will look again.  Thanks.
1004841,bigugli,2017-05-29 06:06:00,6138,"Nice whities.  There is no ""proper"" way to hold a fishing rod, just the right way. Whatever feels ""Right"" for you"
1004875,Headhunter,2017-05-29 18:03:00,5703,"Terry, most Uber drivers don't net fish, just sayin! HH"

1004918,kickingfrog,2017-05-29 23:16:00,8333,"So Terry drives the boat and nets the fish, but doesn't film??? Some guide."
1004921,Terry,2017-05-29 23:32:00,14456,"he will and does but  that is an extra cost to give video to clients ..and well  i dont want to use the too word cheap, but   lol"
1004932,ketchenany,2017-05-30 01:35:00,3229,"Terry is amazing, he does it ALL, boat, anchor and net , who can expect more. I've done that, who could ask for more!"
1004937,GBW,2017-05-30 02:22:00,8460,I don't think I have ever seen anyone hold a rod like that to reel in a fish in my life. Go ice fishing?  Well with some of the tings we wear to keep warm that's a good grip to keep hands warm and still reel line in with the flap of the mitt's (flip over for open fingertip style) not getting hit.  I've caught myself in the summer jigging holding that way from time to time but if a good size fish is on then back to 'traditional' grip (after the hook is set).  Never a wrong way to fish unless the rod is upside down and I'm sure someone will post that meme at some point...
