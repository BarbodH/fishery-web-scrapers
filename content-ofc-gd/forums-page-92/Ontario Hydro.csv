1004537,Dutch01,2017-05-25 18:33:00,1431,So....I guess political threads are okay again?
1004538,leaf4,2017-05-25 18:42:00,2466,I think that's the only route I would go if I were to do one. But at my house the roof was redone a year prior to buying it so I have an 8 year old roof. Seems silly to pay for a new metal one lol
1004541,aplumma,2017-05-25 18:48:00,6896,Sorry you all are getting to political change directions or I will lock it.  Thanks  Art
1004548,Dara,2017-05-25 19:48:00,3052,Put the solar panels on a big pole beside the house.  They are getting quite popular around here  With a good battery bank and a bit of a generator you have it made
1004560,DRIFTER_016,2017-05-25 21:30:00,10439,"My panels are going on my roof @ the cabin. Probably going to run my cables in conduit so the squirrels and ravens can't mess with them. Roof is metal so I don't have to worry about them messing about with that. 1,800 watts of panels will be connecting to an 80 amp charge controller and to a bank of 6 volt deep cycle batteries which then connect to a 3,500 watt switching inverter and generator. The entire system should be about $10K but will run everything I need to. Generator should only need to be run in winter due to lack of sunlight. With 20 hours of daylight in the summer it will not need to be used."

1004596,leaf4,2017-05-26 00:19:00,2466,Don't know if anyone watched the nato stuff today but Trump took it to them about how the US is paying more than the rest of every other nato member he was hilarious. Great to see someone not tiptoe around stuff.

1004607,Dara,2017-05-26 02:02:00,3052, Look at a couple steel posts and a frame to mount them. It would be easier on your roof in the long run and easy to drill a couple epoxy anchors into that rock to hold the posts  likely cheaper than what you need for roof mounts as well
1004608,Pigeontroller,2017-05-26 02:16:00,2793,"Whats this have to do with Fishing???  This thread was political from the get go, and should not have been allowed under the new rules."

Really?  The figure that I read was $50,000 USD for a Tesla roof with battery system.  We wouldn't need the battery system in Ontario if you sell back to the grid.   But even without a battery system a one year pay back doesn't sound reasonable."

1004651,DRIFTER_016,2017-05-26 15:30:00,10439,Isn't that because its always dark then  The sun is very low in the sky during those months and would mostly be blocked by trees and terrain. And it's only above the horizon for a few hours.

It is summer time we are all busy with the great outdoors I do not have time to read all of the threads so I expect people to police themselves for the most part many have done a good job. For the few who keep pushing the political thoughts here you are going to become really unhappy when your account is Mod Qed if you have to ask if it is you then it most likely is.

1004473,Sterling,2017-05-25 13:13:00,477,"So much for the pipe dream of ""clean affordable renewable energy""  It's sad because this is a thing. We just can't get it right. The big boys like China, USA, Germany, etc etc etc are making major investments in renewable energy. And I doubt this is done in the spirit of environmental care. These countries aren't stupid.  Solar, wind, geothermal and to a certain extent hydro, are a sound ways of producing energy affordably.  It's just so sad that Canada can't execute this properly.  My only recommendation is to install your own renewable energy source; whether it be solar or geothermal. Solar is at a point now where it's a clear net gain even without adjusting for future increases in electricity costs."
