1003922,LittleWorm,2017-05-18 23:45:00,122,"I was thinking of getting a subscription to the RLM ( random lure of the month ) but im not sure if its worth it. Is there anyone here that has done this before and have a opinion if its worth the $20 a month. I'm looking at the RLM box, probably not the LTB or MTB, RLM is Canadian and the other to are US based ones.  So yea or nay on the RLM, a good thing or just more crap to try to find room in my tackle box for?"
1003928,OhioFisherman,2017-05-19 01:02:00,6623,"LOL, only one tackle box? you can fill a lot of them with lures that don't work especially well!"
1003934,adempsey,2017-05-19 01:41:00,1498,"For $20 a month I can buy several things that I know will work in colors that I like. If anything, those things are best as gifts or entertainment."
1003935,John Bacon,2017-05-19 01:51:00,3277,"For $20 a month I would expect random lures of the month; not random lure of the month.Regardless, I would rather use the $240 per year to pick what I want instead of what someone else decides to send me."

As you can see by our reviews we work very hard to keep our customers happy.  We also make cancelling very easy if you determine RLM isn't for you.  There are 4-5 lures that come in each box. (We also read the other comments)..lol  Please reach out to us at [emailÂ protected] if you have questions.   Scott www.simplefishing.ca"
1004176,chris.brock,2017-05-23 02:00:00,4053," By calling it ""random lure of the month"" it sounds like a single lure (not 4 or 5), you might want to change that"
1004178,Simple Fishing,2017-05-23 02:03:00,3,Good point. Thank you for the feedback. ?

Me, nope I'd rather go buy what I know works from use and or personal 'hey try this' info.  I need to see it first hand before I buy Yes people definitely have their own "" go to lures"" but we introduce anglers to baits they are unable to find on their own. We have lots of members tell us we introduce them to their new "" go to"" baits.  Our service isn't for everyone but it is ideal for people looking to expand their knowledge and learn about ""new to market"" baits in North America."
