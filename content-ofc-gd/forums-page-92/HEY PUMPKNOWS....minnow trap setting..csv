My son is 28 now and filled with his life; but we still find time to do stuff together. Good going Simon you're building a happy future.  Dan"

Minnow trapping is lucrative... but only if you work hard. We once pulled $10,000 worth of minnows out of a lake... in 3 days. Suffice to say we renewed the trapping license for that particular area for 10 years.  Little tip; try dry dog food as bait. It holds together better than bread and therefore traps longer."
