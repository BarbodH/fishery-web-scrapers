1004137,pics,2017-05-22 12:58:00,1268,"My wife loves the smoked salmon I make.. There's a lot of work involved when you have a smoker with a side box like mine.. It's very hard to control the temperatures if it's windy or cold outside and if you go over 180 degrees for any length of time you get too much albumin which is coagulated protein. Not harmful but it just means that you went too hot, too soon.. A Bradley with temp control would be ideal but I like cutting my own wood for the smoker ... There are utube videos explaining how to make your own pucks for a Bradley... Hmm"

1004297,Mister G,2017-05-23 23:06:00,1429,"And I don't mean rolling them in papers....  I have a new smoker. Its a masterbuilt electric. Pretty cool, but I know nothing about smoking fish....except eating it!!  Lets hear some methods, recipes, special brines...whatever you have to share.  I have some whities I want to smoke, and I will have some lakers to do after the long weekend.  Where do I start?  S. If you can cook a hot dog you can smoke a fish............WAIT, I talking to Sinker......LOL  But anyways.............  To cut time in half or more, fillet fish and leave skin on......  Brine fish in 1 gallon of water and 1/4 cup of Kosher Salt, 1 cup of brown sugar and about a half cup of maple suger (the cheap crap, not your good stuff) and fridge overnight........  Just before smoking (not a cigar) rinse quickly and pat dry...........  Smoke in smoker skin down for about 2-3 hours until the fish is golden brown on the top.......YOU will know it's done.......  Now this is the VERY IMPORTANT part of smoking ""white fish""........don't eat it right away.........send me at least 3 fillets for sampling/testing to see if it's safe to eat and wait further instructions......"
1004314,Joeytier,2017-05-24 00:53:00,3990,"just finished my first ever batch of trout (splake/speck/laker) and it turned out excellent.  It's definitely a heck of a lot more simple than some enthusiasts would have you believe, and definitely not an exact science when it comes to brining ratios and smoking times etc.  I made my brine with less sugar than what the recipe called for to make a very basic toned down brine and it still turned out fantastic.  I also smoked them for about 3.5 hrs to keep them fairly moist and not overly smokey (small fillets mostly).  Cant wait to start tinkering with different chips and brines etc"
1004619,Sinker,2017-05-26 04:39:00,8692,I still havent found the time to get this going. Just back from 6 days of fishing up north......thanks for all the input. I will update when i get it going.  S

1003505,Canuck,2017-05-15 18:45:00,491,Lots of recipes out there so you won't have trouble.  I am partial to the sweeter ones.  Seems to work better with hot smoking.  One word of advice.  Follow the directions closely.  You really do need to let the fish dry out properly after brining and before smoking.  It makes a difference.
1003514,LittleWorm,2017-05-15 19:54:00,122,Cant really help you with any advice on how to use it or what to do but I can step up and offer my services as a product taste tester!
1003523,floater,2017-05-15 20:34:00,220,I got one last year and love it! I tried a liquid brine but switched to a dry brine. I use 2 cups brown sugar and half a cup of salt and a bunch of other spices. I pack it around and over the salmon chunks and let it sit for 24 hours in the fridge. It turns to liquid anyways over night. I rinse off the brine real well and let the pieces dry till they are tacky. Smoke them at the lowest setting for 3 - 4 hours and they turn out great. I use fairly large chunks so if you want 'indian candy' slice the salmon thinner and smoke for longer. For the last half hour I rub each piece with maple whiskey and paprika or Cool Running's jerk spice.
1003529,Fisherman,2017-05-15 20:47:00,7201,"Sometimes it's better to start with the basic kosher or pickling salt without adding any water, sprinkle over the fillets and refrigerate over night, rinse and pat dry, into the smoker for 4-6 hours depending on outside temps.  Alder / applewood seem best suited for smoking fish.  Some guys throw the whole spice rack in there and you don't know if you're eating fish or boot flaps."

1003552,Joeytier,2017-05-15 22:35:00,3990,"I'm in the same boat as you, just got a smoker last week.  Got a nice batch of specks,lakers, and splake from the last couple weeks ready to go once i get back from camping this week.  I'll report back with my findings."
1003557,Fang,2017-05-15 23:16:00,1330,Same directions as GBW but I go over board on the Thai sauce (No Frills) and brown sugar plus extra habanero I like my smoked fish sweet with a bite on a cracker with some great wine and cheese. I bought lots of trout fillets on sale at metro to help with the experiment brines   
1003559,GBW,2017-05-15 23:35:00,8460,"Hey Fang, that looks a little like the one I made many, MANY years ago!  "
1003561,pikeyminnow,2017-05-15 23:54:00,18,"Sinker here is a link to a manual from the Little Chief smoker. http://www.uncledavesenterprise.com/file/garden/storage/Little%20Chief%20Book.pdf I used to have a Luhr Jensen Little Chief smoker and used the 'easy cure' recipe from this manual for smoking trout and whitefish and i found it to be really good. You can add spices to suit your taste but it is good as is. Oh and i used brown sugar rather than white and used pickling salt. There are a number of other good recipes in there as well. My dad still uses a recipe very similar in his old pizza oven converted to a smoker, using poplar as a fuel and they turn out excellent.  Dave"
1003595,mike rousseau,2017-05-16 02:20:00,4661,So how does the smoke part work on these homemade jobies? They look simple enough... do you just put a tin of wood chips on that electric element?
1003608,GBW,2017-05-16 03:36:00,8460,A metal frying pan that can take heat (remove handle) for long times here when I had mine.  Wood must be soaked for a long time to not 'be a fire' but smoke and smolder.  And a big drip tray between the heat and food shelves.  Also works to add water in said tray to provide moisture to the meat you smoke.  My last one was a gas unit so you can dial the heat in.  The hot plate unit in my pic warms then cools then warms and cools...  so took longer to make meals.  If a steady heat all times then good to go in a decent time.
1003619,Big Cliff,2017-05-16 12:22:00,6899,"A small cast iron pan works great.  One trick I learned ed if you are doing a wet brine, put the fish in a zip lock bag, pour I  your brine, squeeze the air out and seal the bag, that way  all your fish gets exposed."
1003634,dave524,2017-05-16 13:49:00,4508,"DON'T over do the smoke, you don't need smoke through the whole process, couple of hours at the start is good."
1003635,DanD,2017-05-16 13:54:00,2223,"I also use a dry brine, made up of 2/3 dark brown sugar, 1/3 salt. The amount of each depends on how much meat you need to cover; but that ratio works well, not to salty or to sweat. Do not use table (iodized) salt; either Kosher or rock salt. My other spices are usually garlic (freshly minced or unsalted powder), lemon pepper, black pepper or cayenne and a splash of soya sauce; just enough to bind all the ingredients. Adjust the amounts to the size of the batch and your taste. Give the fillets a good wash in cold water and pat dry. I usually scale the fish, rather then skinning; I think the meat stays much more moist? Generously cover the fillets on all sides with the brine mixture. Put the fillets in a non-metallic container, cove and put into the fridge for 24 -36 hours. Draining off the liquid that has formed and redistribute the brine, over the fillets where needed. Using a metal container (stainless or not) may give the fish a tinny flavor. After the brine has done its job, rinse the fillets in cold water. I then soak the fillets in cold water for a couple of hours; changing the water numerous times; this will pull more of the salt out. Pat dry the fillets, sprinkle with a bit more lemon pepper and allow to dry in a cool area until the fillets become tacky to the touch. I usual turn a fan on to blow over the fillets to speed this process up. In the drip/water tray I fill it with either lemon or orange juice; adds moisture and flavor. Preheat the smoker to approx 175° - 185° and get the smoke rolling. I use a remote thermometer and place the probe into the center of the thickest fillet. Place the racks in the smoker, close the door and leave it alone. Every time you open the door to have a peek; you loose your smoke and heat. About half way through, I may give the fillets a mist of orange or lemon juice and top up the wood chips if needed. If whatever you're smoking gets a good wack of smoke for the first hour, hour and half; the meat won't take on a whole lot more smoke flavor after that. So if you're not seeing smoke for the last hour or so; don't worry about it. When the internal temp hits around 165° the fillets are done. Now if you taste the fish right out of the smoker, it may taste like a lump of coal, don't worry or get pissed at your work. Let the fillets cool to room temp, then wrap them and put them in the fridge over night. The flavors will blend and dissipate and it'll be great. If you want to serve the fish warm, the next day; I steam them in a double broiler. About 2 inches of water and juice mixture; bring that up to a light steam and then put the fish in the upper half and warm to taste.  Sorry for the long post.  Dan."
1003758,Sinker,2017-05-17 13:57:00,8692,Wow...lots of great info. Thanks!!  S.
1003854,Bondar,2017-05-18 02:44:00,817,I use mine a lot.  I also use it to cold smoke just started recently.  You use a pellet tube and never turn the actual smoker on just use the cabinet . I use just salt and brown sugar on salmon let it soak over night . Then take it out and rinse . Set on the trays and let it sit in the fridge on the tray over night . Then in the smoker . Lights pellets until I get good smoke and let it go for like 8 hours . Need to keep it around 70-80 degrees . If your on Facebook there is a masterbuilt group with a million recipes they smoke everything lol very good info on there .
1003856,Fish Farmer,2017-05-18 11:37:00,2234,"This is the one I use, comes out great, some people over brine, to long in the brine and to much salt. This you can sit down and eat a lot and not complain about too salty. Just did a batch this week, buddy's complain I should do more 8 to 10 pounds fillets, skin on, rinsed, patted dry, cut into small pieces. A good size is about 3″ x 6″, but smaller or slightly larger is fine. Small trout can be cleaned and smoked whole.8 cups water1/2 cups soy sauce1 1/2 cups brown sugar1/2 cup sea salt or kosher salt (Do not use iodized salt. It will impart an unpleasant flavor.)1 tsp granulated garlicDirections: Mix brining ingredients together in a large bowl.Pour mixture over fillets, making sure they are covered, or until they float.Cover containers and marinate for about 6 hours in the refrigerator.Remove fillets from brine, pat dry with paper towels, and arrange on racks to dry for about an hour – until a glaze forms on the surface of the fish.Smoke fish according to your smoker’s directions with alder wood, mesquite, fruit tree or hickory chips. Check occasionally, keeping in mind that air temperature will influence smoking time. Typical smoking times range from 6 to 12 hours. A slightly wet product is best suited for many of the recipes we enjoy and for canning. For straight snacking, a drier product may be preferred."
