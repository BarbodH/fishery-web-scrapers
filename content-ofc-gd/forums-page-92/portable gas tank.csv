It also isn't sealed well so water can get in there. Can this whole apparatus be bought separately? Its got a black lid that screws on, a ""clear"" gas dome that shows fuel level, and a couple metal rods with a float on them that measures gas level."
1004826,Raf,2017-05-29 00:35:00,3495,yes you should be able to get that separately.  propably not worth it and the float will fail a short time later anyway.  get some orings to seal it up.  with a 5 gal tank just lifting it an eyeballing the weight should tell you how much fuel you have.
1004836,Sinker,2017-05-29 04:06:00,8692,Its usually pretty easy to find a good used portable tank. Have a look on kijiji.

1004891,jimmer,2017-05-29 19:48:00,2730,I think it's the ethanol in the fuel that ruins them. I just made a gasket to go under the whole thing and didn't worry about the gauge.
1004896,misfish,2017-05-29 20:31:00,29133,"Rog, buy a new tank. Their not expensive, and you have no other worries. Thats what I would do anyways. For the price of a new one, it,s not worth the effort of goofing around with it. Also the new ones have a clear line on the side to see how much gas is in it."
