1003133,adam lancia,2017-05-12 22:05:00,234,"My family is going to be making the trek from Alabama back to Nova Scotia, across to Toronto, then back to Alabama this summer. We looked into buying a utility trailer, then renting one, then decided that didn't make much sense. So here's where we're at with it now:  We figured that we won't have room for everything in our small SUV for the long drive back to Canada this summer (next week actually), and aren't really thrilled about spending money on a utility trailer. So we decided to look at cheap boats and found a 15' 1972 Terry Bass Boat with a 40hp Johnson 40EL-73D outboard and a 40lb MinnKota Edge (brand new battery too). It's listed as weighing 835 lbs without any other equipment on it. The stick steer is kind of cool (works, even the manual tension adjuster), and the fact that it has a flat floor with a fair amount of room is a big plus. The engine started right up but needs an electric choke override lever (an $11 part online from what I've seen). The trailer has new tires, bearing buddy's and freshly packed bearings, and it tilts. The guy had it on the water in March to ensure it ran and didn't take on water (passed both tests I'm told but he said he'll take me out on Monday for further proof). I think we're going to make an offer on the boat for the simple fact that we'd be killing 2 birds with one stone. It'll be big enough to haul the extra stuff that won't fit in the car for the trip back, and we'll have a boat!There were a couple of small dings in the front center of the hull, presumably from being driven up on shore. The transom looks good, no rot or cracks that I could see. What else do you think I need to look for once we get on the water?Lastly, and probably most importantly considering the drive we're about to do: how does towing capacity translate into actual weight of all items being towed...? Is there anything I need to be especially considerate of when towing? Obviously we won't be able to travel as quickly as we would without it behind us, but what else? I'll register it here in Alabama before we leave, what kind of documentation do I need to bring in order to cross into Canada and back into the U.S.? Do I need insurance for the boat/trailer as in Canada, or am I covered by my car insurance while towing it...? Is there anything else I need to take into consideration?Thanks!!!"
1003138,Old Ironmaker,2017-05-12 22:40:00,8243,"Adam, boats are not pickup trucks or trailers. Look at the capacity of the trailer and know what the gross weight of the boat is if you can with the motor. Boats coming out of a dealer are very closely matched to the weight of the boat. A few extra items in a boat like a few coolers is reasonable, loading it up like it is a mini van is not recommended.  Go to iboats.com and read the sticky at the op of the General Forum page for buying a used boat. I have copied and pasted it here numerous times. Go to NADA.com which is the Blue Book for recreational vehicles and find out the general worth of that boat. Boat prices vary from county to county let alone country to country.  My opinion, rent a trailer and take your time buying a boat.  I have a rule, never buy a snowmobile in the Yukon or a boat down south."

That's an interesting rule about boats and snowmobiles ;-) I hadn't thought of it that way before. I'll be checking iboats.com out tonight. This is the closest I could get on NADA (the motor is a '73 and not a '74, and I'm fairly certain the trailer is the same age as the boat ('72). He's asking $900 but has said he'd entertain an offer. He has also offered to get me on the water on Monday to try it out.  I'm not going to be loading it up with a bunch of heavy stuff, just some lighter, bulky items that won't fit in the vehicle. I figure the total weight I'll be adding in cargo is about 150 lbs at the absolute high end.  The trailer rental aspect isn't great because it will end up costing us just about as much as buying the boat. We're heading out east first, which would be one rental fee, then to Toronto (another fee), then back to Alabama (third fee). It would be one thing if we were doing all of this driving within the 7 day rental window but we'll probably be in Nova Scotia for almost a month alone.  There absolutely isn't an inexpensive way to travel the distances we will be traveling, but there are more financially efficient methods. Ive been offered to have it inspected by a marine mechanic so if anything comes up there, I'll be taking appropriate action."

1003179,Old Ironmaker,2017-05-13 10:28:00,8243,"Adam I highly recommend staying away from a 45 year old boat unless you are a marine mechanic otherwise you are looking to get into some serious pain. It's like buying your very first car that is 45 years old. Sourcing parts alone for a boat manufacturer out of business is a nightmare, even a Johnson that old it may be tough to get parts for. For 900 bucks buy a trailer and sell it when you are done for even 1/2 price and it costs you only $450.00. Please don't buy a 45 year old boat, believe me. It may not take on water now but I can guarantee you that over 45 years it is more than likely that the floatation is waterlogged and the stringers have been compromised. Do you have a link where we can see he boat.  Overloading a 14' boat trailer isn't safe either. like I said a trailered boat isn't a cube van.

Experience is a lifetime of mistakes, wisdom is knowing not to make them again.  I completely understand that there's lots that can go wrong with this boat due to its age. The thing is, even if it doesn't run well, isn't reliable and requires some work over the next 2 years or so, it's still less expensive and less effort (immediate future, i.e. this trip) than buying a utility trailer that will cost me twice as much (the cheapest trailer I have found is $1400) and then I'll probably have to sit on it when we get back. Not to mention that we aren't allowed to part a trailer in the driveway of the subdivision we live in (the boat will be parked at a friends place on the lake I like to fish). Even if the engine requires some tinkering to keep happy, I'm not opposed to that (I have a small engine mechanic down the street who loves older stuff) so I have some guidance there.  I come from a family of mechanics who love older stuff. I've seen when a project goes bad simply due to age and nothing else, but I've also seen how simple and easy to maintain an older piece of equipment can be given that it's predisposed to stand the test of time and have been taken care of.

1003197,adam lancia,2017-05-13 13:20:00,234,"It's more than a little unorthodox to buy a boat when it's secondary function is to be a boat... Even if the damn thing doesn't know how to boat, it's still cheaper than buying a utility trailer. If we get a year or two out of it and piece it out afterwards, that'll still be a better investment than spending money we don't have on a utility trailer.  I'll keep you all posted once we get it on the water on Monday.  Thanks!!"

We too have loaded a 14' tinny with all manner of gear including Birch saplings complete with dirt balls. That was when were young and inexperienced. I am glad you have been lucky, we weren't.

Very similar to the tri hull SunRay we are working on now, same colour too. Looks as solid and well kept as a few pics can depict and will be a real head turner at the dock for sure, especially with that steering. The price is fair even in USD. Especially if you part it out like you said you might. Push down on the 40 with it in the tilted up position. If the transom flexes in anyway it will tell you a lot about the boat and it's future."

I'm picturing it loaded with furniture or something. I need to read closer.  Don't travel with the engine up that high, travel in a down position. But check that the skeg won't bottom out when down. Often trailers for old boats aren't original and a replacement may sit lower than the original.  As far as transfer of title a good question for iboats.com, someone from Alabama will answer you I'm sure. Boat title requirements vary state to state. If there isn't a title in hand from the seller you have a problem getting it registered here, it is the Federal Gov here that registers the boat, the trailer is Provincial.  The insurance question can only be answered by your Insurance provider. You are towing a non Canadian boat and trailer, ask them and get it in writing.

Maybe it didn't kill my mileage because it's narrower than newer bass boats. No issues at the boarder either, even with a clearly full boat with a tarp over it's contents.
