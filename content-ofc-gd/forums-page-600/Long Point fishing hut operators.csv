(Nor do we know anyone who owns all this to take us out either.)  What companies have any of you used there and who would you recommend?   Thanks  Splashhopper and Dutchy"

529872,tb4me,2010-12-18 18:02:00,3295,Propers or Grangers you cant go wrong with either..They say the huts will be out on the 27th and are already reporting 5 inches of ice!!Getting excited!!
529902,asdve23rveavwa,2010-12-18 19:38:00,2690,"Grangers, Shermans or Jimmy's (Rotten Ronnies)...all three are reputable.  Used Grangers twice last year, was happy with the service provided.  As stated above, bait, transportation and wood provided in the price. Grangers and Shermans are basically side by side down the hill at St. Williams...Jimmy has his huts out of Old Cut."
