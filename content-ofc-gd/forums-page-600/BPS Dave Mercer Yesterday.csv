Although I've always heard how nice Dave is this was my first time getting to actually meet him.  All I can say is that I'm so impressed with Mr. Mercer.  He took the time to get personal with everyone he spoke to.  He was nice enough to sign his book, my hat and my brother in-laws hat.  He also let us take a few pictures with him.  Class act and reinforced why he is my favourite fisherman on television.  "

I don't have kids, but it was very impressive to see him interact with the young kids, you can tell he hopes to see them on the water one day."
