530232,crappieperchhunter,2010-12-20 03:50:00,2582, X2 for me  No one current to today has played the game like #4 Bobby Orr. Retired at 28 cause his knees where screwed. Never played an NHL game with good legs...cause he already had knee troubles in Junior. I can't even begin to imagine Orr coming to the NHL in good health and having a 20 year career like a lot of other defencemen.  No one else measures up.

530123,Grimace,2010-12-19 21:16:00,2020,  My aunt has a game used Bower goalie stick signed by the cup winning team.  He personally got it signed for my grandparents after a game at the gardens.  He threw it over the boards to my grandparents because it got a little crack in it on a shot.  They took it to the dressing room after the game.  Back when you could do that.  He popped his head out of the dressing room and my grandparents asked him to sign it.  He said give me a few minutes and came back after getting the whole team to sign it.  It was the 1964 team I think.  Carl Brewers name is on it.  Carl was not on the 1967 team.  I think Bathgate is on it.  He was on the 64 team but not the 63 or 62.  Anyways cool story.
530125,Grimace,2010-12-19 21:18:00,2020, Carl Brewer
530149,uglyfish,2010-12-19 22:59:00,981,17 for wendel clark and 27 for sittler.  4 for mr bobby orr the greatest to ever play the game!
530166,kickingfrog,2010-12-20 00:07:00,8333,"No doubt the leafs could use the big M, but he never scored 50 goals in a season, let alone in 50 games."
530170,Grimace,2010-12-20 00:17:00,2020,  Correct.  He must be mixing the stats up with his final St Mikes year at 52 goals in 49 games.  The big M did score 48 for the Leafs and 49 for the Red Wings.
530173,kickingfrog,2010-12-20 00:25:00,8333,"    Separating the wheat from the chaff  Eddie shore Doug Harvy Bobby Orr in Oshawa  I've got a book somewhere from a few years ago that listed the ""best"" players to wear each number in the NHL. Some numbers had some stiff competition 1 through 10 in particular. Some numbers had only 1 or 2 players to have ever worn them at the point of publishing."
530177,kickingfrog,2010-12-20 00:28:00,8333, I remember when Vaive scored 50 for the leafs it had been Frank's record.

Couldn't bring my self to follow the Avalanche so I stopped cheering for any team and that led to a serious illness call Leafitis. We get hammered by the media through TSN and Sportsnet, you feel so bad for them you start to actually route for them. The perennial underdog.  I'll now go cry myself to sleep......again...."

Also, no player has stood up to Leafs ownership/management they way he did when he tore the C off his jersey, and, did an interview for Hockey Night In Canada, when Lanny McDonald was traded."
530045,JohnF,2010-12-19 13:31:00,3494, #6 - our eldest son's. I had more fun watching him play than all the pro's I ever watched. He wore that number thru all the years and all the myriad sports he played save for baseball when for a reason I can't remember he was #15 so I guess that would be my second choice. If any of the great pro's happened to share his choices they were probably copying him.  8)  JF
530049,kickingfrog,2010-12-19 14:23:00,8333,"16, 9 and 7. All were worn by Bobby Hull durning his career. His brother wore 9 I believe."

Potvin was a tank in the early nineties, a great time to be a teenage hockey fan in Leaf land.  For a winger I like single digit ""power forward"" numbers.  9 Howe, 8 Neely, 7 Roberts (toronto).  Nothing wrong with 10 (Roberts) and 17 either."
530074,Tybo,2010-12-19 17:01:00,1373,number 14. For the leafs is the all time great centre. If you need to be told whom it is . You don't know hockey.

530080,Dondorfish,2010-12-19 17:17:00,1000,  LOL - was never a leaf fan ( always a Habs fan) - but Keon was a very tallented hockey player that I feel never got the credit that he deserved.   Tracker (Don)
