528484,PikeMolester,2010-12-14 21:34:00,428,I'm sure a few of you guys have seen the commercials on WFN. I think I'm going to order some. Has anyone used them before? I'm just scared the loop will pop right out of the limestone when snagged up abit. Curious if anyone has any comments about the quality of these sinkers. http://rockybrooksinkers.com/ 
528490,Fish Farmer,2010-12-14 21:47:00,2234,"Hay, that's kinda neet  . Thanks for posting. Great idea, just wunder how the glue holds up."
528493,mercman,2010-12-14 21:55:00,7054,  looks like they drill a small hole in it and glue the eye into the hole.Looks like epoxy so i would think it would hold up just fine.Very kewl idea for sure
528501,Fang,2010-12-14 22:18:00,1330,"Have seen these advertised on WFN. Great idea as cost of material is pretty cheap. pay the kids to pick rocks from the local river. I paid some good money a while back for a few camo sinkers for carp, same idea - they were rocks with holes drilled in them"
528512,misfish,2010-12-14 22:37:00,29133," Camo sinkers   Just cant take the hunter out of the fisher eh.LOL    They are really cool,great idea and cheap too. Im thinking a good diamond drill will cut yer hole and an epoxy fill. It does say patten pending,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"

528565,aplumma,2010-12-15 00:02:00,6896,This one is going to win the I am SOOOOOOOO Politically Correct award of 2010. It's a good idea if the sinker is a detraction to the fishing method. I do remember as a kid pond fishin and needing more weight and tying a loop on to hold a rock in place.  Art
528693,Rod Caster,2010-12-15 11:50:00,5784,Not as dense as lead or tungsten but a great idea none the less. I considered making these a while back but got distracted by non-rock things.
528744,johnnyb,2010-12-15 15:18:00,3413,Wow...those rock!

529585,mercman,2010-12-17 20:03:00,7054,"i treid making them when i was younger, but was too stoned."
529587,Garry2Rs,2010-12-17 20:05:00,1425,Can I find them in Stoney Creek?
529681,PikeMolester,2010-12-18 00:08:00,428,GREEN fishing is just a stones throw away...
529683,Leecher,2010-12-18 00:21:00,7832, Now that's bloody stone cold

529789,wkrp,2010-12-18 12:43:00,656,Dont they get caught between a rock and a hard place?
529890,Garry2Rs,2010-12-18 18:52:00,1425, I only use them in the weeds because... A Rolling Stone Gathers No Moss.
