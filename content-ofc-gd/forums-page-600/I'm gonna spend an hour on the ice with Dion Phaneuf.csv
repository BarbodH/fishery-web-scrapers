529185,stubbex1,2010-12-16 18:11:00,164," I'm a flames fan, and am a member of calgary puck.  Rumors are flying around there with all the hype about Dion playing for the first time since the trade.  http://forum.calgary...ead.php?t=99415  http://forum.calgary...ead.php?t=99425  I think the leafs got the better end of the deal.  Stajan is NOT a first line centre, Ian White scored some goals for us, but was constantly being pushed off the puck, and has been traded since for pretty much nothing.  Hagman, on the other hand has become sort of a fan favorite, works hard every night making defenders look silly, although his stats aren't that great.  Dion has a huge ego, is tough, and is lazy, he's become a floater.  After watching the video highlights on here, its hard to believe he's the same player now. I used to love the way he played, even have a jersey with his name on the back.  What the heck happened to the guy?  Big contract got to his head?  i dunno.  Dan, sorry I didn't mean to hijak your thread, so cool to be able to skate with him!  whatever you do don't try to screen the goalie when he's taking a shot at the net LOL"
529443,HTHM,2010-12-17 13:43:00,4082,"So, is it confirmed, are you the prize winner?"
529460,lookinforwalleye,2010-12-17 14:12:00,4399,"Congrats it should be fun, years ago when we did some summer pick up hockey a few pro`s from the European leagues used too come out and scrimage with us and it`s amazing how these guys carve up the ice. Have fun but keep your head up Dion likes to take runs at people when their not looking!!!"
529468,danc,2010-12-17 14:52:00,4677," I will be heading home today some time from Red Lake and of course I will review the documents, sign everything and get them sent back. I will keep you guys posted."

529896,Leecher,2010-12-18 19:12:00,7832,Excellent Dan   Enjoy your wining prize!!! Leechman
529930,Joey,2010-12-18 21:41:00,9122,"That's awesome Dan, Congrats!!!  Now, where is that calculator"
530013,irishfield,2010-12-19 03:46:00,26272,Make sure you do everything inside the brackets first!!!
530019,danc,2010-12-19 04:07:00,4677," Grade two math Wayne. BODMAS. Brackets, over, division, multiplication, addition, subtraction. I didn't spend 12 years going to school for nothing."
530040,lunkerbasshunter,2010-12-19 12:41:00,2585,hey go easy on him.  dont want to school him to bad on the ice and ruin his confidence!  (opps to late)  Have a good time!  Cheers!
528636,danc,2010-12-15 03:38:00,4677,"OK. Here's the story. I'm still working in Red Lake. Been here since last February more or less. As usual, I phone Sis (Nita, my better half) tonight. She asks me if I entered a contest through Dewalt power tools. ""Ummmm... not that I can recall"" I tell her. And I ask her why? She says that Purolator delivered a package today that said that I am ""potentially"" the grand prize winner of an hour on the ice with Dion at the ACC, tickets to a game, flight, hotel, autographed jersey, etc. ect... Then it rings a bell. Yes I did enter such a contest on line a while back. Now the word ""potentially"" scares me a bit. But the package apparently came with all kinds of forms and legal crap, witness signatures forms, and a skill testing question. It also came with a Purolator pre paid return envelope to send everything back in. I should also mention that there were two grand prize winners. One with a skate with Phaneuf, and one with a skate with Luke Schenn. My package mentions nothing about a skate with Schenn. I think the ""potential"" is only if I answer the grade two math question correctly and fill all the forms out. Legal stuff.  Sooooo..... DAMN!!!! I'm thinking I won this thing. I hate to let the cat out of the bag if it isn't so, but I just had to share this with someone. I'd absolutely hate to have to retract this news later.  So,anyone want me to take out Phaneuf,s left eyeball during our skate???"
528638,irishfield,2010-12-15 03:47:00,26272,I'd stay in Red Lake Bud.... it's friggin wet and bone chilling down here..  Hope you win.. be a good change of scenery for sure!!
528639,muskymatt,2010-12-15 03:50:00,2608,Careful....you know the saying. leafs and Titanic...both look good till they hit the ice....
528640,GBW,2010-12-15 03:54:00,8460,"Wayne, today wasn't bad, yesterday was tho..  Good luck DanC!  Just don't fall down and kick his leg..."
528642,irishfield,2010-12-15 03:57:00,26272,I know all too well Geoff.. 5pm yesterday I walked from hospital to Yonge.. all the way down to Front and back up 'till two blocks North of Carlton finally finding Jen a MR SUB.. then back to the hospital only to watch her barely touch it. I'm still shaking today...
528647,danc,2010-12-15 04:02:00,4677, It was -37C here yesterday morning Wayne. I never thought that -25C (this mornings temp) could feel so warm.
528650,irishfield,2010-12-15 04:06:00,26272,"I'd prefer that I think Dan to the wet bone chilling crap down here. Always something about the streets (wind tunnels) of Toronto and the ""pollution dome"" enhansed dampness of the streets/sewer grates/subway etc steaming the streets."
528651,DRIFTER_016,2010-12-15 04:09:00,10439,  Tell me about it!!! After a week of -40 I'm outside in a tee shirt when it warms up into the -20's. It you think -37 was cold you should try -50!!!! It's like walking through liquid nitrogen!!!!
528652,GBW,2010-12-15 04:11:00,8460,BINGO!  It's the crap that comes up from below that makes it worse. Sorry to HJ the thread DanC...
528655,danc,2010-12-15 04:23:00,4677,"  Been there and in colder temps than -50 Dave. I've worked all over Northwestern Ontario at all times of the year. The James/Hudson Bay areas aren't exactly tropical in January. Did I mention that I'm going for a skate with Phaneuf, I think??"
528667,ctranter,2010-12-15 05:02:00,543,CONGRATS ON THE WIN!!  Touch a hair on his body and I personally guarantee your stride won't feel the same  Just kidding  After tonights win us Leaf Fans have to protect our assets

529148,cwpowell,2010-12-16 16:36:00,265,"Haha,great prize! Sure hope you don't have to take a hit from him! He's like a brick wall."
529154,solopaddler,2010-12-16 16:49:00,8605,If you get a chance asked him what the heck happened between him and Sutter in Calgary.  I've heard a few rumours.
