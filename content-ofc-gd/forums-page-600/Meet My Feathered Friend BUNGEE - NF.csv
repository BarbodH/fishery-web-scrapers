529747,Leecher,2010-12-18 04:12:00,7832,"Well tonight got to playing with the camera and shot multiple footage of my pet bird Bungee, a love bird.  This little fella is such a delight to watch every time I come close to his cage that tonight just could not resist  I've tried numerous times to capture the moment on cam in the past but did not want to play along and act normal    Tonight I was able to capture when he says his name and ask me what I'm doing in french obviously    So I've compiled numerous videos into one for you to watch and hope you enjoy  Leechman  <embed width=""600"" height=""361"" type=""application/x-shockwave-flash"" allowFullscreen=""true"" allowNetworking=""all"" wmode=""transparent"" src=""http://static.photobucket.com/player.swf"" flashvars=""file=http%3A%2F%2Fvid732.photobucket.com%2Falbums%2Fww321%2Fleechman1%2F2010%2FBungee%2FBungee2.mp4"">"

529985,vinnimon,2010-12-19 01:44:00,2593, Hello bungee 
529986,aplumma,2010-12-19 01:49:00,6896,Thats a smart bird he knows more French than I do.   Art
530006,Leecher,2010-12-19 03:32:00,7832," He sure is Corvy!!! Amazing cool little bird   Thanks Joey!!!   Thanks Vinni!!!   Thanks Art!!!  He can speak other words but that's what I was able to get out of him last night.... He tends to be a little camera shy when I power it on  He does say ""bonne nuit"" or ""fait attention"" (which translate to ""good night"" and ""be careful"" )  when we put the cover on the cage and funny thing is, when ever I walk past the cage, he always says ""qu'est-ce tu fait"" which is ""what you doing""    of course I always respond ""I'm going to bed"""
530010,AzuluSpookd,2010-12-19 03:42:00,348,Awesome stuff!
530012,Leecher,2010-12-19 03:46:00,7832, Smart little bird    Thanks Zulu!!!
530014,limeyangler,2010-12-19 03:49:00,5204,Lol...what a cool bird. They are awesome pets!
530016,Leecher,2010-12-19 03:54:00,7832," They sure are Simon!!!  The three of us are the only ones that can handle him.... any other and he bytes     and trust me that beak is as sharp as it comes, does not take much to poke a hole through skin  When I have him on my shoulder, he goes for the hairs on my beard lol and gives me kisses too"
