Barb and  i stopped in to wish them both Merry Christmas yesterday afternoon.We started talking and sharing Fish Tales, and life experiences and before we knew it, it was getting dark.Roy insisted that we stay for dinner, and proceeded to cook us up a meal fit for a king.Veal in a fine mushroom sauce, sauted baby potatoes, and fresh steamed veggies. Then some fish talk and a great Video on Muskie fishing with Marc Thorpe. For anyone who knows Roy, and has been a witness to his skills and his hospitality, you know we were treated like royalty. Thanks Roy and J for a wonderful day. God Bless you both and have a wonderful Merry Christmas.  Paul and Barb Mercman( )"
