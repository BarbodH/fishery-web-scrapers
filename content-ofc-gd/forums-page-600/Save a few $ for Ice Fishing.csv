I just picked up a Black cat and tested it out in the garage. Tested it out in the garage. Kicks out a lot of heat.  For propane cylinders guys, head into the tool area at CTC and get a 1lb propane bottle for the soldering torch for $1 less than the same green Coleman bottle in the camping section.  Now all I need is to finally finish the financial plans for 2011 at my work and they'll let me take my holidays - Friday was supposed to be my last day. I'd say I'll be done around Wednesday so fishing Thursday/Friday and all thrrough next week."
