530327,Rich,2010-12-20 19:08:00,3927,"Headed out for the first trip of the season yesterday with a couple buddies on some local ponds. It was a successful mixed bag but unfortunately the true species we were after (big northerns) only showed his head once. No leader and a new fangled tip up device got the best of me and I lost my first trophy of the ice season on a frozen sardine.  Otherwise, the slabs, bluegills and perch were good to me.  First fish of the day was a little largemouth. The only one I saw all day. I gave him a quick photo since he was the first fish of the season. Hope that doesn't offend anybody.        "
