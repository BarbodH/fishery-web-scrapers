529933,vinnimon,2010-12-18 21:48:00,2593,"Thanks to slow poke , I have a need to make pike and musky lures! In line spinners to start! I went to Bills Bait for some supplies and as ussual they had it and some Any way I had to make a few inline spinners today! Off to work I went, twisting the wire, adding beads and blades, then the buck tails So far, 2 were made and many more to come! Initially I used jerk bait leaders for the main wire, but then a hint from a friend turned me to something comparable and a lot cheaper Billy Joel came to mind(hint) For all you lures makers, what do you think? Will they catch a Pike/musky? I hope so!  "
