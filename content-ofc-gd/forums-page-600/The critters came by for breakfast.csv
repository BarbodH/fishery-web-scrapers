I have a trail starting at the back of my property that meanders 1/2 a mile thru the bush out to hwy 28 and alot of them come down there, but they also come along the dirt road in front of the house and come up my driveway.  Pretty kool to be sitting here at the puter looking out the window and have a herd of deer walking down the road only 100' away  Here's a couple pics I took earlier today when it was still fairly dark out and snowing but you can get the idea.
