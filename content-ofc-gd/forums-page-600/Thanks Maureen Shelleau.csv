528141,John,2010-12-13 18:27:00,2956,"A few months ago Maureen Shelleau, an accomplished artist who specializes in horses and dogs, offered OFC members a cut price on a pastel portrait of their beloved equine and canine friends. Maureen had previously posted a request for some help, guidance and input from OFC and its members and in addition to her artistry runs a business along with Phil (Harrison), ""off the dock"" (t-shirts etc..). This offer was basically a thank you for the help that she received and also as a thanks for those who have supported the off the dock brand.  You will see her offer under the members business section. Her OFC name is Lake Ranger.  In short, I took Maureen up on her offer and was absolutely overwhelmed at her talent and her ability to capture likenesses of an animal that I have only seen perhaps once or twice before.  I will let the art work speak for itself............  "
