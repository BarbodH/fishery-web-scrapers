He has an 8inch for fishing, but wants a 4 inch to use with his finder and camera and is hoping a four inch would be an easier drill through thick ice... Anyone know where they came be gotten? Have tried most of the local shops and searched high and low on the web, nothing to be found. Any help would be greatly appreciated! HH"
