529942,Terry,2010-12-18 22:48:00,14456,"Lloyd and I meet at the lake this morning the first spot didn't have safe ice the second spot didn't have safe ice the third spot had safe ice  we slowly inched out testing as we went thanks BrianB for the spud it worked great  we got out deep enough and set up  my first try at using a battery drill on an auger failed.... I had the drill going too fast and it bent the adapter ...sorry Brian my bad...I should not have had it made that long, was about 16"" too long, I was surprised that it bent..oh well    was marking lots of little fish        but they were small, my first fish of the season.....       Lloyd was on a smelt pattern, but a big smelt pattern...       Lloyd used his hut       but I braved the elements      we moved around but couldn't get to the good spots but I was out fishing and things were working well the ice adapter kit for my HDS5 worked well  can't wait to get out again...next..maybe simcoe... thanks Lloyd had a good time on the ice"
529945,misfish,2010-12-18 23:01:00,29133," Thats the part where the blade goes?  If it is,I have have a fix for that.   Smelts,,,,, YUM YUM"
529946,Terry,2010-12-18 23:04:00,14456,it's the part that attaches to the auger
529947,BUSTER,2010-12-18 23:07:00,1336, better than not fishing
529950,misfish,2010-12-18 23:17:00,29133,Guess  Lloyd is missing the warmth of the far south.LOL  Only -2 today and still shacked up.LOL
529952,Leecher,2010-12-18 23:22:00,7832,Excellent Terry    First time out always the greatest Thanks for sharing Leechman
529955,Terry,2010-12-18 23:35:00,14456,it never went above -5 where we were and was windy at times ..but Lloyd does like it warm...LOL
529961,Rod Caster,2010-12-18 23:50:00,5784,So cool to see smelt through the ice... I was just thinking about the upcoming smelt season.  Are you just marking the baitfish (smelt) and using small bait to catch em? Are they aggressive?
529964,Rizzo,2010-12-18 23:57:00,4754,good for you Terry! I got out for a couple of hours this afternoon as well for the first time this season. Got a few dink pike for my troubles.
529966,crappieperchhunter,2010-12-19 00:18:00,2582, Yep...what de man said. I'll be couching it in the AM
529967,Joey,2010-12-19 00:39:00,9122,Really glad you two got out Terry.  Wish we could have made it this time.  And you got a fish  C'mon Simcoe ice  Joey
529980,mercman,2010-12-19 01:12:00,7054,great job guys !!!
529994,Terry,2010-12-19 02:36:00,14456,thanks all  we were not fishing for the smelt most times when a school goes through you snag them by mistake I guess a small bait and they would bite....
529997,asdve23rveavwa,2010-12-19 02:45:00,2690,"Good that you guys ""broke the ice"" on the ice fishing season.  Still feeling like a bag of crap so probably a good thing I stayed home."
530008,irishfield,2010-12-19 03:39:00,26272,I know that spot.. I always park by the silver van !!!
530009,limeyangler,2010-12-19 03:41:00,5204,"Great first outing, its not easy when you cant get to the good spots...but like you said...good to be out! -5? THATS SUMMER...I'D NEED BUG SPRAY HERE....LOL."
530032,Terry,2010-12-19 11:00:00,14456,   I will bet you don't know that spot.....I didn't know the spot we were nowhere near anywhere we went before but you are right ..just park near the silver van
530047,MCTFisher9120,2010-12-19 14:07:00,3761,"Nice job on the fishing, won't be out until next weekend  Thanks for sharing, MTBF"
530282,johnnyb,2010-12-20 15:25:00,3413,Nice to get out and shake the dust off....sounds like Cook's is good to go now too....bring it on!
530296,tonyb,2010-12-20 16:31:00,1637,Very nice guys! a pre-christmas ice fishing report  I actually prefer the LCD sonar readout when ice-fishing.  It provides a short window of 'history' as the screen scrolls by so you can show your buddies that big hook that just came up and smashed your jig  (or missed it! hehe)    
530311,EC1,2010-12-20 18:04:00,930,Your HDS-5 looks amazing! My black and white Humminbird is not very cooperative for ice fishing this year it seems. Looks like a good day out!
530325,Terry,2010-12-20 18:58:00,14456,the hds 5 works well well it doesn't like shallow water..under 6 ft it takes forever to lock on  and if you are doing a run and gun type of fishing it takes a while to boot up the computer in it
