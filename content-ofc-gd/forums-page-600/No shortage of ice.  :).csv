530017,DRIFTER_016,2010-12-19 03:55:00,10439,"Got out for a little fishin' today close to home. Hit the ice at dawn and didn't get off until dusk 5 hours later. At least it was a nice warm -20 degree day!! Sure beats the -40 highs a week ago. The lake is a lesiurely 3 minute snowmobile ride from my door, so I don't know why it's taken me 4 years to fish it. Probably because it's too close. Got out, picked a spot and drilled a bunch of holes off a bluff covering water 10' to 35' deep. Set a ciscoe on a tipup shallow for pike and jigged the rest of the holes for eyes and whities. Fish were showing on the Marcum almost non stop but they were non committal for the most part.  I managed to land 1 small pike about 4# on the tipup and 1 smallish whitie on a Bad Boyz jig tipped with a minnow. I lost two other fish (walleye I think) and had about 1/2 a dozen bumps from whitefish (I think a shiner can hit harder than they did today) I wouldn't even had known they were hits without my trusty LX-5 as the rod tip only moved about 1/8"" when they hit it. Any how on to the pics.             PS I also have a video entered in the WFN contest.  Ice Road Fishers the Movie"

530052,highdrifter,2010-12-19 14:26:00,2534,Minus 20 up there is still way better than our minus 20..  Number 3 is a great shot!!
530102,DRIFTER_016,2010-12-19 18:10:00,10439,"  Yep. I can see it from my front porch, so I figured it was time to fish it. Nice and close for those short days in December and January."
