Tried mid-lake humps and rocky points; mostly deep 15ft+. The sun was out in full force, so that made for a comfortable outing. There was 6-7 inches of ice on this small lake just off the Trent. Be careful on the bigger lakes, not sure they are ready yet.    Next stop lakers and whitefish on Simcoe! Hopefully sooner rather than later.  Cheers!"

529344,EC1,2010-12-17 02:30:00,930,Looks like an awesome day! I never got to find someone to go out with me for the bass closer though..Lucky you.  What did you try for baits? I was thinking an almost deadstick shakeyhead presentation might have been good!
529459,pooch,2010-12-17 14:12:00,139,"I was thinking the same thing, but instead went for a reaction bait like a Lindy Darter and such. If I knew a bass was there I was going to try drop shotting some gulp, but never got the chance."
529765,highdrifter,2010-12-18 05:43:00,2534, Was just wondering about that..
529972,ehg,2010-12-19 01:02:00,2666,The cool thing is your icefishing for bass. This is something completely new with the Zone 17 rule changes. Has anyone else tried this?
