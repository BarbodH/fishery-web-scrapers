529840,bassmaster4,2010-12-18 16:23:00,801,coming from a leaf fan that is funny but a thread just for bashing the leafs? would you be so kind as to disclose your favorite team?
529842,crappieperchhunter,2010-12-18 16:28:00,2582,Don't have a favorite team...only ever watch hockey during the playoffs and not much of it then either. Much rather go to the arena and watch Junior hockey. Just got this email today and thought I would share. Like I said...that's it that's all.
