529502,jedimaster,2010-12-17 16:58:00,3472,It looks like Ontario now permits studded tires for northern residents? Seems very nice to know that we can run studded tires now. I think I'll get some for the porsche.  http://www.mto.gov.on.ca/english/safety/topics/wintertires.shtml
529503,jedimaster,2010-12-17 17:00:00,3472,http://www.mmage.com/psmplra/studdedtires.htm  I didn't even know this until just now.... Did anyone else?
529504,Raf,2010-12-17 17:02:00,3495,"it's been that way for a while.  the address on your driver's license has to say you are from the north.  so my question, does someone from the north venturing south of the french have to pull over past the bridge and remove the studs  or can they drive on them in southern ontario.  ahh looks like the cutoff is nippissing and parry sound districts"
529508,jedimaster,2010-12-17 17:07:00,3472,Wonder if anyone has gotten a ticket for driving with studs in the last few years.
529513,mercman,2010-12-17 17:10:00,7054, INSTALL THEM AND LET US KNOW
529515,BillM,2010-12-17 17:12:00,17367,"That's like saying you'll get charged if you are driving a car from NS to here because we require front plates.  If you are allowed to run studded tires and your address of residence proves it, they can't charge you with anything."
529518,jedimaster,2010-12-17 17:16:00,3472,Who said anything about my address proving anything?
529522,BillM,2010-12-17 17:36:00,17367," Read a few replies above you, I was answering a question."
529523,mercman,2010-12-17 17:43:00,7054,"studs give you forward traction, but very little hard braking advantage as most of the studs on the contact surface tear out during a hard braking situation.AND, when they fly out at high speeds, they can bust a windshield really quickly."
529525,BillM,2010-12-17 17:50:00,17367, Maybe back in the 70's  The studs that are legal in northern Ontario are considered 'lightweight Scandinavian studs'  which aren't metal and won't be busting any windshields when they let go.  Everything is explained on the MTO website.
529527,Bernie,2010-12-17 17:59:00,3190,"Haven't seen too many missing studs in tires around here. They are not even made of metal. Yes, they are legal here in Parry Sound-Nipissing. And Merc, gotta disagree, they work great when braking. Studded winter tires are like driving on rails. Awesome."
529530,bare foot wader,2010-12-17 18:10:00,1354,running my first pair of studs here in BC...last winter and this season....night and day difference...and IMO really help braking  have a set of west lakes
529532,mercman,2010-12-17 18:12:00,7054,"  Could be i didnt install them properly i guess. Did them myself with a kit. a reall pain in the  to instal, but they came out like a breeze"
529536,BillM,2010-12-17 18:20:00,17367,I'd love a pair of metal studded tires for Simcoe this year
529614,DRIFTER_016,2010-12-17 21:13:00,10439,  WOOHOO!!! I'll drive down next week and do donuts at queens park!!!! No shortage of studded tires up here. Some people keep them on all year long.
529624,BillM,2010-12-17 21:49:00,17367," You have 30 days if you are out of province or country  Then you can be charged.  So do as many donuts as you can, lol."
529647,Tybo,2010-12-17 22:28:00,1373," Dave,Don't you mean,Try to do donuts."
529660,OhioFisherman,2010-12-17 22:58:00,6623,"I always ran studded snow tires here, as did a lot of people. They were factory or dealer installed though on new tires. I never had any significant loss of studs."
529666,DRIFTER_016,2010-12-17 23:12:00,10439,"  Nah, you can still spin 'em up pretty easy. Unless you're rockin' a set of these bad boys!!!!    Or these    Or maybe a set of these  "
529922,POLLIWOGG,2010-12-18 20:59:00,835,"Yeah do some donuts, they'll impound your vehicle  and take your license. Then you have to go home to NWT to get your license back and come back for your vehicle. Welcome to the police state of Ontario where apparently according to the mto it doesn't snow in southern Ont..  And don't gripe about it or they'll thump ya.."
529923,limeyangler,2010-12-18 21:09:00,5204,"I ran my all seasons on my light truck the first winter i had it, i switched to winter tires with studs the next year, what a difference, especially on the bush roads that are basically a sheet of ice by Jan, like someone said...running on rails."
