529621,jedimaster,2010-12-17 21:40:00,3472,Last i read from another board was only slushy ice. Be careful.
529627,BillM,2010-12-17 21:50:00,17367,I wouldn't trust it yet.

529629,hockeyplayerz_14,2010-12-17 21:51:00,160, Well I will not step on the ice if I dont see any foot prints.
529632,jedimaster,2010-12-17 21:58:00,3472,Tracks going out and none coming in and noone on the ice kinda creeps me out.
529640,Fish Farmer,2010-12-17 22:08:00,2234,"Was on the Cooks Bay site and there was a guy out fishing Cooks 14' FTW catching small Perch, he said there was 4"" of ice were ""he"" was. But your on your own. Just be careful. Myself, I'd wait another week. A fish is not worth your life. I wouldn't want to read about a OFC'ER gone missing."
529644,steelhedrmatt,2010-12-17 22:20:00,278,"3.5"" last sunday at virginia beach.  fishing pretty much sucked. got enough for a small feed. Ice is pretty inconsistant yet.  I wouldnt suggest goin alone"

529731,Fisherman,2010-12-18 02:46:00,7201,"Yes, nice video, someone has to tell him to get a foam covered mike or quit rubbing it on his wishers..bad noise."
529733,Fisherman,2010-12-18 02:48:00,7201,"Aha, much better, thanks.."

529851,Sandbag,2010-12-18 17:20:00,533,"Ok...here is my experience only.  I would never suggest to anyone that the ice is SAFE at anytime of the year.  I walked out from Gilford yesterday (17 Dec).  I spudded my way out and drilled holes along the way.  There was a small soft spot right at shore and then no more slush.  There was only maybe 2 to 3 inches of snow on top of the ice, so it was pretty good for walking out.  Walked out about 500 metres to ten feet of water.  Ice at this distance was approximately 5 inches thick with four inches of good ice and one inch of honeycomb on top.  Fished there for a while and lots of fish, however small for the most part.  Walked out about another 300 metres to 16 fow.  Ice there was approximately 4 1/2 inches again with the majority being nice clear ice.  Bite here was good as well with with more keeper.  Again, this is very early in season, spudded our way out all the way and did not find any punky spots.  This is my experience only and care must be used at all times.  Cheers all...have a great season  Craig"
529865,BillM,2010-12-18 17:46:00,17367,Not worth it for dink sized perch.
529886,crappieperchhunter,2010-12-18 18:37:00,2582,My bro told my wife he is going out of pefferlaw tomorrow. He doesn't have any ice fishing gear at all...so I am assuming one of the hut guys is taking him out. I have not been able to confirm this with him. Anybody know of any activity in that area? I was up that way last weekend and the ice there looked like crap.  Maybe my wife got the message from my bro mixed up too...I don't know.
