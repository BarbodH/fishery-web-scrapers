529951,Leecher,2010-12-18 23:19:00,7832,Awesome dude Looking forward to wetting some hardware too    soon Leechman
529956,Rod Caster,2010-12-18 23:39:00,5784,looks like fun! I got out today for the first time today...felt good to be on the ice!
529965,Rizzo,2010-12-19 00:00:00,4754,sounds like a few of us got out there today for the first time. A few perch is better than sitting at home (or even worse...shoveling snow!)
529968,Smarty Pantz,2010-12-19 00:39:00,203,"Awesome, WTG!!! Also got out on the ice today  Already dreamin' about the next time I'm out.....beats cleanin' house & doing laundry hahaha!!!!"
