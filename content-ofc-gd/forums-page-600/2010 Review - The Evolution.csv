Yes, the addition of Eliana meant less angling for me but I still managed to get out to satisfy the itch. In years past Bass and Pike occupied most of my days but this year I chose to mix it up to target a larger variety of species.   March - May  One of many intruders while in the pursuit of STEEL           Highdrifter with some Spring Steel.     June - Sept  In July, I purchased my first fly rod/reel combo. It's too bad I couldn't find the time to use it in prime resident trout streams. To fill the void, I put it to use in the not so nice river right behind my place to target Carp. Before I got the fly set up, I was able to take the light action spinning gear to some nice water and connected with a few smaller fish.          In August, Highdrifter and myself headed up to Nipissing to fish in extremely difficult conditions. We did manage a couple though...         Then there was the fall...What an awesome couple months it was.  My buddy Dan's sweet Brown! Dan, you are a great angler and an even better friend and mentor.     Another solid fishing partner.             Now on to playing some basketball for a couple months to get this butt in shape.  Thanks for taking the time. All the best during the holidays and in 2011!
