529490,Guest Johnny Bass,2010-12-17 15:37:00,0, Nothing to be sorry about.  I think everyone should buy domestic(in their own countries) unless you buy a product that is not made in your country. In that sense I dont mind Americans coming here and Canadians going over the border.  This free market is moving all the wealth from North America to Asia......
529495,cranks bait,2010-12-17 16:31:00,721,"  I agree 100%.  I find it funny how people argue about buying Canadian, then go to another country to buy stuff?  This is exactly why the manufaturing is overseas.  I too get chastised for driving a Honda.  My reply is always ""It's built in Ontario, bought in Brockville, you can't get more local than that"".  I'd rather spend my money locally that way there is a better chance of them coming to me next time they want to purchase.  I say this not only as a business owner, but for everyone out there that has a job.  To keep local businesses you have to shop those local businesses, your job is included in this.  As for retailers having lower prices because of the HST, I am confused by this.  The product is not any cheaper.  If anything I now have to spend more money to get the product here, there is no difference in price to the consumer."
529500,mercman,2010-12-17 16:42:00,7054, BOB !!!! You are such a nice guy!!
529675,bucont,2010-12-17 23:44:00,20," Dalton McGrinch during his HST sales pitch stated that with the HST the businesses would be getting a tax break and in turn should be passing it onto the consumer. We all knew he meant, someone has to make up the shortage. I hate being a 24 hour ATM for government."
529740,Guest Johnny Bass,2010-12-18 03:27:00,0," Ya, that's just like the tax breaks in America to the super rich( as their deficit and inflation spiral out of control). Its supposed to create jobs and the money is supposed to trickle down to the consumer,(rather then take money out of their own pocket, they spend the tax payers money.)......  Our politicians are now in the pockets of the rich corporations just like in America. This is not about helping the little guy out. It is about helping they guys(corporations) that line their pockets.  HST/GST has got to go.  Yes I know......Do not pay attention to the man behind the curtain. He doesn't know what he is talking about. Carry on. Pay your taxes so businessmen can afford to live in luxury."
529754,irishfield,2010-12-18 04:29:00,26272,"You know Johnny.. there is nothing stopping you from moving out of Mommy's house.. jumping a few hurdles and starting a business of your own, where you can take advantage of that HST reporting/rebate form!   Heck.. stay under her roof, get an Ontario Corp # and have at it..."
529794,OhioFisherman,2010-12-18 13:21:00,6623,"Wait until the end of June, Presque Ilse state park on the north side of Erie has some very good bass fishing. It is a big sheltered bay with easy access to Lake Erie, a good launching ramp, and for big smallies leave the bay and head east about 7 miles. I believe Erie has a casino now? not that I would gamble on anything but fish in the boat."
529797,Guest Johnny Bass,2010-12-18 13:29:00,0," So in other words if you can't beat em join em????And what about all the people that don't have businesses? I should live off their backs too via high taxes? I know there are a lot of business men on this board and my opinions aren't popular, but I'm willing to wager that the majority of Canada(and every where else there is high taxation) agrees with me. Now if HST were going to improve social services I would not have too much of a problem with it. But to support business owners of most who are already wealthy? No way."
529809,cranks bait,2010-12-18 14:44:00,721," Hmm Wealthy business owner?  Not me that is for sure.  I would probably make more money working at McDonalds, but I choose not to.  Running a business is not all fame and fortune.  It costs a lot more than what people think.  As for the HST rebate that business got.  It doesn't do anything.  Now large corporations might have gotten a bigger cut?  But is sure a heck is not enough to change prices on anything.  Now maybe if they cut down the property tax on busnisess that would help out.  My new location that I am moving into next week has two apartments above it.  They do not even pay 1% combined of the taxes that I do as a busness.  and they are each larger than my business.  The education tax that I pay is rediculous, but that is again, my choice to have a business.  No the HST is not doing any good for anyone.  The government needs to control their spending and salary increases, but I doubt that will ever happen."
529829,TennesseeGuy,2010-12-18 15:55:00,957,A couple of times every year I tell the mother of a deadbeat son that she needs to outlive her son because there is no way he can survive without her.  A few posts on this thread are proving my point.
529846,Guest Johnny Bass,2010-12-18 17:05:00,0," WOW! Much more then a couple of times A year I have to tell people to go live off their own sweat, and not the sweat of the people.  My mother doesn't support me in any way other then putting a roof over my head. I moved back in to my mother's home to help her out when my father passed away. You idiot. I am more then capable of supporting myself. And not doing it off the backs of the tax payers."
529847,Guest Johnny Bass,2010-12-18 17:10:00,0," Sure you chose not to. Why earn a living with your own sweat when you can earn it off of others? I have run businesses, and am well aware of some of the stress that can be associated with it.  Its not a mater of changing prices. It is a mater of taking from the consumer to give to the business owners. The more taxes you collect? The bigger your return will be. So obviously, this benefits large corporations more.  Take from the poor to give to the rich. And then they wonder why the rich are getting richer and the poor poorer.  There are many things that can be done to facilitate a better business environment, but the rich wont share their wealth. Therefore why should the poor and middle class be forced to pay?  Oh no. I might not have any fishing partners now.LOL I'd rather give up fishing altogether then support this robbery."
529853,Guest Johnny Bass,2010-12-18 17:25:00,0,"And I'd like to add that this is not about me. I do okay. This is about all the people I know that are working hard trying to make ends meet. Increasing taxes by GST/HST helps no one, but businessmen."

528921,dickie,2010-12-16 01:00:00,64,"Ever heard the quote: Out of job yet? Keep buying foreign. Look at the social benefits that you get from this country compared to what they get in the states. Your dollars spent in this country allows business to profit, who in turn put taxes in the system that YOU also benefit from. Going to the states once in a while I can see, but making a habit of it certainly does not help our country, and in the long run those who shop there."

529018,bucont,2010-12-16 04:04:00,20," You seem to have it all figure out. The whole picture however, I think not!  You buy foreign just about every time you walk in a store on Canadian soil. You can continue to shop at big box stores in Canada and buy all those overseas products and ship the sales profits down to $20 billion man Sam Walton as he refuses to pay the Canada store workers more than min wage. Or buy a car from a North American auto company (US owned and operated) that outsources the majority of the content overseas to increase the profit line and puts the Canadian and US workers out of good paying jobs and they hopefully end up at a min wage job. Or get gouged at the pump by gas companies that are mainly controlled by out of country interests and is taxed through the roof. Or pay twice as much for milk products because the milk board dictates it. This goes on and on.  How many products do you buy that are made in Canada?  This is a large economic engine and retail is only a very small part of it. Remove the good paying jobs by outsourcing, remove the customers, close the business, both retail and service alike.  We are in a world economy, why should a retail or manufacturing business be allowed to shop out of the country and we can not? A major US owned Canadian retailer is about to move the textile business to another third world country to increase profits. And you can bet those extra profits will stay in the US and they will escape with paying the minimal tax possible here in Canada.  Think about what this country would be without our largest trade partner and neighbor and perhaps you will see that we are both in this together and that is the whole picture. If you think for one minute that if the US economy goes down we are not going follow, my friend you are sadly mistaken."
529044,aplumma,2010-12-16 12:41:00,6896, Well said my friend with both countries working together it is possible we all might get out of this with a buck or two in our pockets.    At

Whatever happens in that department will gradually show up over the first 5 years but the difference if any will be buried in inflationary increases.

529053,Billy Bob,2010-12-16 12:59:00,5865,"Christmas Eve I will be shopping in Fairfield, Ohio at the largest grocery store in the world......Jungle Jims...http://www.junglejims.com/  Gonna buy a BIG Standing Rib Roast and treat some Air Force guys who couldn't get home for the holidays a nice home cooked meal....  Merry Christmas (not happy holidays)  Bob"
529062,JohnF,2010-12-16 13:28:00,3494,"I was once a staunch defender of the Buy Canadian movement but over the years it's become evident that there are few Canadian businesses, just businesses located in Canada. The big box stores use a part timer only strategy so really aren't paying much better than poor wages and the companies are owned out of country. I'm no longer sure that I'm helping the Candian economy by paying extra to buy locally. Case in point - I was commended and criticized for driving a Honda and a GM minivan. Guess which vehicle they commended me for? The van, of course, which was American built. The Honda was the cause of my castigation. It was built in Alliston. Clearly most folks who preach this stuff are blowing smoke.  Another reason for me to shop elsewhere is that I live in a small Ontario town which for more than half the year is overrun by tourists, many of them from the States here to enjoy the theatre. This means specialized boutique type retail stores with high prices and snooty restaurants which serve excellent food but the prices are outasight (read high).  Since I'm in the Cleveland area so much it's just easier to shop there. In the course of exploring that area I've discovered certain stores that offer great deals for the stuff I buy. Kohl's department has a fairly good selection of brand name clothes although I'm not impressed with the house brand products so I buy a lot of clothes there. Gander Mtn, although generally not full of bargains for me, occasionally has a plum to offer. Last New Years Day I picked up a small Calcutta for $95 and could have had a Quantum Energy spinning reel for the same price. The trick is to drop in occasionally and see what's available. Sam's Club often has deals on common household items in the grocery department and soap and toothpaste type stuff. Groceries are a great deal but generally it isn't practical to take advantage of much of that stuff. Gas is a great price, even when it's way up there.  We always visit a large outlet mall (Aurora Farms) just outside of Solon and I can generally find good shoe deals at Bass, shirts & pants at Van Heusen, underwear at a Hanes store, pants at Haggar, sweaters at Eddy Bauer and a variety of other things. Once in a while I spot a great sweater at Nautica or Polo. The trick is to know the stores and where to shop. I suppose if I hung out in the GTA enough I'd learn where to shop there too. For instance I discovered a very out of the way manufacturers outlet in an industrial mall near the airport where I can get great deals on track suits & Stormtech jackets etc. The problem is that I almost need a map to find the place it's so hidden away.  I wouldn't go to the States just for the shopping. We visit back and forth with relatives from Solon at least once every 3 months and over the years have come to feel pretty comfortable in the Solon area. I think the other thing is that I never think to just go shopping around here unless I need something and I just want to get it done. I relax in Solon and just wander around the stores and malls for entertainment. I buy stuff when I spot outstanding deals on things I need or just can't resist because of the great price.  JF"

529093,Guest Johnny Bass,2010-12-16 14:22:00,0," They should open up a Box store that sells only Canadian(and some US). They did that in Germany and it is very successful. I think the trade off is ok. Some Canadians go to the States, and some Americans spend their money in Cananda.But I think Americans get a tax exemption???  Anyways, I remember cross border shopping wayyyyy back before our loonie did a nose dive.The cheapest thing I used to buy in America were my leather jackets. You could save $500+ dollars easy."

The major Canadian retailers want you to think they dropping prices. Sears stating they were matching US Sears prices on black Friday, not so. We are looking at fridge from Sears and the US price was still $400 less.  Be the way who is still waiting for the Canadian retailers to drop the prices due to the HST?

If I do shop in the US, it's mostly for items I can't get locally.   If you really try you could probably save money on buying items on sale and paying attention to what is duty free based on NAFTA.   Another example are things like designer clothes/accessories can be had very cheap if you know where to look.  I used to live in a border town and people used to cross-border shop all the time.    However, they also used to sneak the stuff back across the border so they didn't pay tax or duty.  They'd do things like wear crappy clothes there and buy a new outfit and wear it back.   Especially shoes.  Things like that.
