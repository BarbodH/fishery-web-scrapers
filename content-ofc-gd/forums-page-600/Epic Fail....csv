Something big that pulled drag for a few seconds then sent the spoon flying!  This was my 1st real adventure at using roe collected from last months lower trip with Castelleno.  Had some nice Brown roe to work with. Combination of fresh & cured. 5 colours of mesh, a few bags of each colour, 2-3 sizes in each as well. Made sure to have some bags approaching the size of a quarter incase water was coffee like.(Wife happy I didn't spill any while working in front of the TV   )  Spent on average an hour each at 8 different spots working the float anywhere from 10-50 feet out from waters edge just tumbling along bottom. Not even a bump. Tried various Mepps, cleos, & others. Only the 'spitter'.  Visibility was only 1½ feet or so.  Only saw a couple of others hook up the whole day. One guy hit the 'grand slam' of trout. Apparently his 'successful' weapon of choice was live minnows.  Oh well...at least I got some exercise and the scenery was nice.    Good luck out there this weekend!"
