Many times you can land a fish without one but when u are up an ice road a 100 miles from anything it is nice on occassion to use a gaff on a fish u know u are going to bring home especially with the windchill factors u can encounter.  I have a meeting with the fisheries tomorrow and would appreciate a list of the provinces that allow them,  even the COs could not totally understand it  Thanks in advance  John"
