844623,BillM,2014-03-31 15:34:00,17367,Neither when a cheaper will do just fine...  this is for your main correct?
844627,grimsbylander,2014-03-31 16:09:00,3016,It also matters what you're running off the main as well. Cranking plus...pumps? electronics? how many? Side/down scan?
844628,NANUK,2014-03-31 16:09:00,797,An $80 battery will last you at least 5 years with basic maintenance
844634,lew,2014-03-31 16:35:00,12766,"An $80 battery will last you at least 5 years with basic maintenance  Yup, and on my last boat I got 8 years out of both deep cycles & the cranker.  Just keep them charged."
844662,Sinker,2014-03-31 19:13:00,8692,Same as everyone else. I'd buy two cheaper ones that last just as long and work just as good.  S.
844680,fish_fishburn,2014-03-31 20:39:00,1311,"A 27 series, 1000cca should do you. Just leave the darn stereo off when you have to manage your power for a full day. I have a little transistor radio if I want to listen to something. The money you save you can put toward a battery management system if you don't already have that. By the way that battery is about 120 tops at wallyworld."
844724,aplumma,2014-03-31 23:09:00,6896,With the choices you have optimax battery because if you have an issue it is widely distributed and warrentee is easily taken care of. I personally run the best batteries in my boat some times I fish two or three days straight without any chance of charging them. My optimax batteries once brought me back to the dock when fuel pump dumped on me.   Art
