Edit: if returned safely, reward will be given."
844633,Joeytier,2014-03-31 16:34:00,3990,"I'm lovin' those micro jigs...you've got some great stuff man!  Just kidding, hope a miracle happens for ya"
844636,irishfield,2014-03-31 16:48:00,26272,"Always sucks losing stuff, the good part is you get to buy some new stuff..  ... All my gear, fish finder, rod bag, tackle trays have a name and phone numbers on them.. cell, home, camp. That may at least make them feel a tad guilty if they were thinking of keeping the stuff and might get me a call to pick something up I left behind. Lloyd wishes he had of done the same when he lost his rod bag full of high quality rods and reels a couple of years ago at Jacksons Point."
844655,BowSlayer101,2014-03-31 18:31:00,296,"ya, im gonna label all my gear from now on, maybe it will get dug up in the snow and ill find it next weekend, maybe.....lol"
844660,mike rousseau,2014-03-31 19:09:00,4661,That's a really good idea...  I imagine there's a lot of people that would call... If I found gear that someone cared enough about to label with a phone # I'd call em...
844705,davey buoy,2014-03-31 21:49:00,5505,"Me as well,great idea!!"
844729,aplumma,2014-03-31 23:26:00,6896,I put my business card in any bag I use so people can call email or deliver anything I lose. It does my heart good when they call thankfully it is not often this is put to the test.     Art
844761,Big Cliff,2014-04-01 00:53:00,6899,"I should have put my phone number on my tackle box last year so when they stole it out of my garage they could have called me to return it! Actually though it is a good idea, if you found something like that out on the ice where would you start to look for the owner even if you did want to return it."
