844368,crappieperchhunter,2014-03-30 04:00:00,2582," It costs much less than that to install membrane and dimple board when the house is being built, yet few builders do it. I dunno about you guys, but if I were looking at two comparable houses i'd choose the waterproofed one every time and I think it's a huge selling feature.  While i'm typically against more rules and regulations, I really do believe that it should be required by code for every foundation below grade to be properly waterproofed. Waterproofing would be a slam dunk no doubt. However in many cases proper grading would eliminate any problems before they exist depending on your soil composition. It's kinda like making snow tires mandatory. 85 % will pay for the 15%....my numbers totally pulled out of thin air not facts... who really need it. Not trying to start a fight, cause I actually support mandatory snows...just throwing it out there for debate."
844371,danc,2014-03-30 04:16:00,4677,This kind of shoddy workmanship would never fly here in Thunder Bay. Apparently our standards are amongst the highest in the country. There's a new multi million $ Marriott hotel here that has just been completed and word on the street is that it will never open. It's sinking. It was built by a bunch of non union fly by night contractors from Toronto. Stay home and build your crap in Toronto. We build with union quality up here.
844372,crappieperchhunter,2014-03-30 04:38:00,2582,Not doubting you Dan. But a multi million Marriot in TBay? Who in the heck would stay there?  Not necessarily a destination those with big bucks flock too. Sounds like a white dinosaur to me. It's really not even a stop over for anywhere else.I'm thinking word on the street might be a little out to lunch.  And sorry.... union quality? I'm in Oshawa.

Union quality by our standards means something entirely different from what your are suggesting. There's several hotel chain developments being built here right now. Apparently there's a demand for rooms? The company that I work for has a Holiday Inn job complete with a pool right now as well. And there's a few more on the drawing table. Just because you don't stop over here doesn't mean that the rest of the planet doesn't. Thunder Bay is a strong union town. The Marriott job is just another example of non union fly by nighters expecting to come into town and leave with pockets full of cash. They may get away with substandard workmanship elslewhere, but not here. And the union quality thing? The non union contractors that come here do pathetic work and are often chased out of town. The company that I work for has done many fixes after the scabs have left. The Marriott scandal is one of the biggest non union issues that have ever occured here. I heard that none of the (non union) sub contractors will never be paid. The place is sinking and the floors are cracking daily. Is that how things work in Oshawa? Cuz they sure don't work that way up here."

Just questioning a marriot in T-Bay based on a relative who lives in Sudbury....travels the world far more then you and I ever will and never has a reason ever to go that way? Unions IMHO don't ever do a better job. That was the point I was trying to illustrate.  You might be right in your opinion for your chunk of the planet but I have never seen that sediment to be true in any business sector I have seen elsewhere.

Last September my dad and I dug a hole outside that had to be a little over 5ft deep, 3ft wide and 8ft in length. I believe my dad patched it with cement and tarred over it all. Thank God it worked...We had to dig out a ton of rocks and the clay was super tough to dig out.LOL  A number of years ago, my parents hired someone to patch the wall from the inside...That worked for only a few years and it started to leak again."

841862,ch312,2014-03-18 16:50:00,1590,"Nothing against Smellybox, but a Sika polyurethane crack repair kit can be had for $75 or so if you're somewhat handy and feel comfortable doing the repair yourself. It's a relatively easy process, but following proper procedure is critical in completing a repair that will last.  Even if you seal the crack you should address the root of the problem to ensure leaks do not occur in the future or you'll just have more leaks if another crack occurs.    If the basement is unfinished you could take the cheaper (nothing beats exterior waterproofing) approach to solving water issues by installing a french drain style system that consists of 4"" perforated weeping tile around the perimeter slightly below the footing, dimple membrane (Delta MS) on the walls that go down to the footing and extend over the weeping tile, and sump pump. The water will seep through the walls and the membrane allows it to flow down the wall past the slab into the weeper and then into the basin where the sump pump gets rid of it. "

842053,DOS,2014-03-19 17:30:00,119,"Here are my 2 cents worth. Sika will work...sometimes,  Injection will work more often than not, only proper repair is from the outside.  Now let me explain.  Concrete foundations will always crack but it may never be a problem if your drainage is proper outside. This winter has been severe compared to the last 10 years and therefore there will be a whole whack of leaks this spring that don't usually happen and if left untreated may not happen for another 10 years.  These types of cracks can usually be patched with Sika or any number of hydraulic cements with sucess.  Where this type of repair will fail is if there is any movement in the crack.  If this leak is in a crack that has just recently appeared you have some bigger issues.  Injection repairs are much better for newer cracks as there is more 'flex' to the product than cement.  $450 is cheap compared to an insurance claim if you get a flood.  If you do the patch, chip out the crack a minimum of 1/2"" deep and 1/2"" wide, dont just put frosting on the cake... and when possible(summer)  dig down from the outside and tar and felt the crack properly.  Good luck  Dan"

Good luck  Dan  The Sika injection kit I was referring too uses polyurethane that expands and remains flexible, the same style of injection that Smellybox has likely used to solve many water issues. Like Smellybox mentioned, the only time that hydraulic cement will work long term is if there is zero movement of the concrete as even the slightest amount of movement will break the bond of the hydraulic cement as it is not flexible.  Polyurethane injection stays flexible, hydraulic cement has zero flexibility."

It does state it as a flexible polyurethane but it is more of a semi rigid polyurethane similar in compressibility to what you would insulate around windows and doors. JMHO   This is all I used at my old job and the owners always had success with it. I'm no longer doing injections, but what brand would you choose over any other?"

844092,lhousesoccer,2014-03-29 00:29:00,442,"I lived with a foundation that leaked for a long time.  Settling cracks allowed water to wick through every time it rained hard, and in the spring as the frost went out and snow melted, it would get worse. I had a feeling that when my house was built, they didn't put in any drainage around the foundation, and living on a slope, sub-surface and surface water would run downhill and pool on the outside of my foundation.  Hydrostatic pressure over the years finally worked its way through, opening up some pretty sizeable cracks.  It shouldn't have been this way in a 23 year old house, but shoddy site prep by the builder (one family owned it before me) - and that's what you get.  Anyways, I was tired of having that knot in my gut every time the skies opened up, wondering how bad it would be this time.  So I started looking in to it, seeing what my options were.  I considered injection from the inside, but everything I read and everyone I talked to said that if you want to do it right and fix the problem permanently, you gotta hit it from the outside.  So I hit it.  Hard.  Dug up the foundation.  Powerwashed it.  Filled the cracks from the outside with Sitka.  Adhered bituthene over the cracks.  Spray coated rubberized watersealant.  Attached overlapping Tremco drainage board.  Filter fabric and drain tile to code.  Clean stone backfill.  That was the fall of 2012.  Not a drop of water in the basement since.  And we had some hellacious rainfalls and runoff after that.  Best $6000 I've ever spent, for complete peace of mind, knowing it was done right this time.                                      "
