845167,Big Cliff,2014-04-02 20:27:00,6899,"A very special thank you to a fellow OFNr (you know who you are) who in response to my post about going fishing for rainbows;  Set me up with bait, loaned me his own rod and tackle, took me to one of his favorite spots, set everything up for me and left me to fish for as long as I wanted. The end result was a nice 8-10 lb rainbow and two more misses under what I am sure weren't ideal conditions.  The kindness of our members is legendary!  It won't be forgotten!  Big Cliff"
