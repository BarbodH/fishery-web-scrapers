845394,mattaw,2014-04-03 17:48:00,162,"Don't forget all the problems they had last year in Bancroft with the York flooding downtown. If they have double the snow this year and it melts faster its going to be a night mare. I know last year they were very close to having the damn break emptying the bulk of Baptiste. Crossing my fingers for those up in the low areas near water.  It was around April 20th the flooding hit hard in Bancroft. If the warming and melting trend continues having double the snow in the same amount of time would be devastating. http://cnews.canoe.ca/CNEWS/Canada/2013/04/21/20758726.html I think that may be a misconception about the dam. One of the dams on the lower York did break, but a few friends talked to some people that came to look and analyze the risk of the dam (Baptiste) failing. They seemed to feel like it was in good shape and not at risk of breaking.  The flooding was terrible though. The volume over the dam was crazy. We'll have to see how this year melts out."

845396,Sinker,2014-04-03 18:30:00,8692," From what I understand, the water breached the dam, and went over the banks along side it. They had to bring in stone fill to avoid the banks washing away, not the dam itself.  S."
845401,jedimaster,2014-04-03 19:25:00,3472,"I thought that there were reports of it nearly breaking or something. Who knows. Needless to say with nearly double the snow and simlar temps expected in april, if there is another rain storm it coudl be real bad news two years in a row."

They had to bring in stone fill to avoid the banks washing away, not the dam itself.  S.  This may be true, I don't know, I didn't notice signs of that later in the year though.  I thought that there were reports of it nearly breaking or something. Who knows. Needless to say with nearly double the snow and simlar temps expected in april, if there is another rain storm it coudl be real bad news two years in a row.  There was a rumor floating around about that for sure. I'm very worried about the snow and ice on the ground there right now, melting slowly but with rain slated for next week.. It may get dicey. There are other dams in the province that have similar situations too, not good for the communities situated directly below them."
845407,jedimaster,2014-04-03 20:13:00,3472,"Eitherway if I got flooded last year I would make sure I was ready this year just in case. Start emptying the basement, double checking sump pumps buy some sand bags or whatever. I don't live there but I know a few who do and fortunately they are on higher ground. I don't think its a panic situation, just a be prepared situation. Hopefully after last year the engineers and local govt's have these things on there mind now so they can react quickly. All the signs appear to be there. Late Thaw, Heavier snow. Rapid temp increase. Only thing they can't predict is the weekend of heavy rain they got."

845174,davey buoy,2014-04-02 20:42:00,5505,Friday 10c plus rain.At least tonight it will be well into the minus.Hopefully that helps slow the melt a bit?
845176,Sinker,2014-04-02 20:43:00,8692,This is far from a quick thaw. We'd be in serious trouble if our snow pack went quick up here. We've been blessed with a slow thaw thank goodness. Still lots of snow to go yet!  S.

One thing I can tell you guys that I have noticed is the snow pack north/west of Alliston is still substantial compared to north/east of Alliston  . This area is the head waters to the Pine , Boyne and the Notty so it will definitely get a lot worse in the coming week with some rain and warmer temps. Down stream lookout !!!"

The Pine was dirty and up about 18 inches, the Mad was up about 2 feet but not as dirty.  Then the Notty is in need of some ex lax.  I seriously believe they need to blow that big log jam out of there."

I was going to say I have a couple friends in the Parry Sound area as well as Algonquin and they told me that as of last week there had not been a bit of melting and there was still 28"" of ice on local lakes and a bush snow pack of 24""-30"" . If they get a quick melt up there the river dwellers better start building an ark !"
