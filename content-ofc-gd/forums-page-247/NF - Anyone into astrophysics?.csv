845216,jedimaster,2014-04-02 22:44:00,3472,Does anyone know if the moon will be visible tonight?
845234,Roy,2014-04-02 23:32:00,13728,Got cloud cover?
845240,Big Cliff,2014-04-02 23:54:00,6899,Depends on where you are but clear skys for the lindsay area for tonight so it should be.
845248,Dave Bailey,2014-04-03 00:30:00,1641,"If you are waiting to see it in the Hyades star cluster, the info I have says it will be tomorrow night."
845257,Fisherman,2014-04-03 01:06:00,7201,"Clear here, crescent moon and frosty."
845260,woodenboater,2014-04-03 01:13:00,2277,"Looks beautiful from Toronto, waxing crescent moon in the west."
845311,jedimaster,2014-04-03 11:09:00,3472,"Yes, it was out last night. I was trying a calculator yesterday, couldn't figure out if the moon was above the horizon or not."
845323,woodenboater,2014-04-03 12:29:00,2277,"If you're really into astronomy, Starry Night is a very good program. Not sure how much it costs but it's pretty powerful."
845376,BillM,2014-04-03 15:50:00,17367,"If you're really into astronomy, Starry Night is a very good program. Not sure how much it costs but it's pretty powerful.  Star Walk is another one...  Great app for your phone.  If you want to take pics, starting around April 11th (as long as there is no cloud cover) you shouldn't have any issues getting some great shots."
845496,adempsey,2014-04-04 03:16:00,1498,The Night Skies Network is pretty cool.    People broadcast video from their scopes.   Some decent views at times.
