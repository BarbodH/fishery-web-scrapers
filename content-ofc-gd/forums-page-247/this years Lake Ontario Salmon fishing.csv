841799,fishdawg,2014-03-18 01:27:00,912,"Chomping at the bit to get out soon to chase down some trout before the Kings arrive! Should be an interesting season to say the least after this prolonged ""Artic Vortex"" winter....  What's everyone else thinking?"
841800,irishfield,2014-03-18 01:29:00,26272,I'm thinking of going North for another week of ice fishing Mark !
841802,Gallie,2014-03-18 01:52:00,1215,I usually dont start going until the kings are puttin on weight. That being said this winter should lead to an interesting season. After we had two really good years i hope we can put a third in a row.
841816,porkpie,2014-03-18 03:53:00,2521,"Can't wait!  Also can't get my damn boat out of the driveway, it's still frozen in a snowbank!!"
841821,fishindevil,2014-03-18 09:26:00,6254,Guts usually start chasing them as soon as you can get out on the lake we used to start some years the first week in April in port Dalhousie and Jordan harbor !!!! Lots of fish and all tight to shore in 20-40 feet of water !!!! And talk about fight !!! Wow a 15lb silver king in ice cold water the fight is amazing also early spring browns along the shoreline running xraps on long line or running an inline board !!!! No need to wait till summer some of the best fishing happens from April till June !!!! Cheers
841826,BillM,2014-03-18 11:38:00,17367,"Southern shore was a bit of a bust last year..  A lot of the fish seemed to be over on the US side.  If that's the case this year, I'm hauling the boat over.  Might as well make use of that NY license"
841828,Gallie,2014-03-18 11:50:00,1215,"We had an awesome year last year, multiple fish over 30 lbs, 20+ fish days, one day with 8 or 9 fish over 20 lbs. mind you the first couple weeks of july were hit and miss but after that we slayed them till september. If this year is half the year 13 was ill be happy!"

841841,John,2014-03-18 13:28:00,2956,Sounds like fun Mark. Maybe we can work out a day to fish together this year..
841854,Sinker,2014-03-18 15:15:00,8692,"I'm thinking I won't even get close to my boat for at least another month. The snow in my yard is nuts!! I'll keep drillin holes until then though, tons of ice left!  S."
841857,NANUK,2014-03-18 15:56:00,797,The winter kill on baitfish population will be quite big this year IMO
841859,ch312,2014-03-18 16:33:00,1590,"I was out last Tuesday when it was 12 degrees and got a sunburn on my head. No fish for me, but I did see 3 browns landed.   Here's to hoping this season (my second) of trolling for salmon results in a bigger fish than my current PB...  "
841861,tonyb,2014-03-18 16:48:00,1637,It's going to be tough to top last year!      I am thinking a cold and extended spring which should be great for shore anglers to take advantage of the big fish cruising the shallows!
841864,fishnsled,2014-03-18 17:28:00,3520,Can't wait to get back out there again.  Lots of fish last year but never broke the 30 pound mark and would like to do that this year.  Picked up some some stuff to try out and anxiously waiting to do so.  Bring on the warm weather please!!  Nice fish Tony and congrats once again!
841872,Gallie,2014-03-18 18:19:00,1215,"Werent you the guy who won the derby last year? If so that will definitely be a tough hill to climb, but were all chasin the same thing"

841939,spincast,2014-03-18 22:53:00,3279,"the south shore was tough last year for sure (for me at least). A late start and smaller fish than previous years. Biggest of the season was just a touch over 30, off the North Shore (courtesy of Capt Pikeslayer) Cant wait for this season to start.  This colder winter will hopefully keep them in closer longer. Plus I owe the Cpt a Laker day for my half of the deal  Hopefully I can pay back the favour"

Plus I owe the Cpt a Laker day for my half of the deal  Hopefully I can pay back the favour  You know it's rough when you gotta run from Weller to the Bar in order to catch a greasy lake trout!!   Usually if you hug the bottom around Weller, it's pretty much laker after laker.  We marked a lot of fish last year but man they just didn't want to commit.   Like I said, if the US side is hot again this spring, that's where I'm going.."

As well if you win a top 5 placing in any category, you get an additional chance in the draw.* They will be also running a Summer Derby, same format and same payouts running from June 14 - August 12. Again, everyone who buys a ticket, qualifies for the draw for the 2116 Scotty HP Downrigger.

Instead, there is a new ""Members Division"" which will run concurrently with both the Spring & Summer Derby. There will be one placing for each species in the ""Members Division"" and you cannot enter the same fish in both divisions, it has to be one or the other. Please refer to the rules.Summer Derby will have same rules, format & payouts and will run June 14- Aug 9They are going to try to use social media as often as we can to keep regular updates coming.The SCGFA will also be running the 1st annual Port Dalhouise 3x3 Salmon Classic over the May long weekend May 17-19.Very simple concept. Any boat owner (""captain"") has until the Friday at 6pm to register their boat for $50. From Saturday 6am, to Monday at 2pm, they may enter any and ONLY 3 salmon that are caught from that boat.
