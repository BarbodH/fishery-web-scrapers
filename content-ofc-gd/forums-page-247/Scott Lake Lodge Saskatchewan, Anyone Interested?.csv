I thought I'd throw it out there to see if anyone here wanted to take advantage.  Scott Lake Lodge in northern Saskatchewan is pretty much as good as it gets as far as luxury Canadian fly in lodges go. The quality of the trophy fishing for lake trout, pike and grayling is outstanding as are the accomodations, food and guides. Here's the website if you'd like to look:  http://scottlakelodge.com/fishing.html  It's also VERY expensive at $5495 for 5 full days of fishing. I have been given a handful of dates for Scott Lake in August this year pretty much encompassing the entire month. I've also managed to secure these dates at a GREATLY reduced rate. I'd rather not say publicly, but if any of you are interested I'd be happy to tell you directly. Emails are okay but I'd really prefer a phone call. All of my contact info is on my website at www.canadafishingguide.net   Cheers, Mike"
