844630,AmblinRamblin3,2014-03-31 16:18:00,11,Anyone actually get their rebate? I've been waiting since new years. The rebate website was checked on weekend and my claim was approved in Jan. I left a message and still waiting for response.
844631,misfish,2014-03-31 16:22:00,29133,I bought mine in December. Got my rebate two weeks ago.  BTW The $50 is in American. Nice little bonus.
844638,smitty55,2014-03-31 17:06:00,928,I finally got mine last week. I gave them a call just to check up on things. It does work. Cheers
844639,Thrilla,2014-03-31 17:11:00,164,Yup got mine 2 weeks ago
844796,bassmaster4,2014-04-01 03:39:00,801,How do I apply for this rebate?
844839,misfish,2014-04-01 14:47:00,29133,I got mine when I bought the unit. The store printed it off for me to send in. MAKE SURE YOU GET TWO COPIES OF YOUR RECIEPT. SEND THE COPIED ONE.
844881,smitty55,2014-04-01 18:21:00,928,How do I apply for this rebate? Just go to their website. The form is there. Hope you kept the box as you need the proof from the box and not just the receipt. Cheers
