How in the heck are they supposed to taser him?   At some point, an officer has to enter the bus and face down an armed individual. Is the assailant going to charge, strike out or surrender. You cannot know that. That is the heat of the fight. That is what brings the adrenaline surge. Easy to criticize from the comfort of a padded chair"

Well the reality is as long as there is a person behind a badge there is a chance of that person being just as mental as a person behind a butter knife. Its part of the risk. Now in reality yah this was not a good situation and the offender will and should face life in prison. IMO police shoudl be held accountable no different than the public would be. In fact maybe more strictly. Why? Not because I hate police that isn't the case. It's becase they signed up of there own free will to do a job and protect the public versus kill the public or take bribes, or play favorites, or discriminate. You pull your gun and jackhammer the trigger you should be held accountable. Of course I dont know the full story and non of the public will likely know the full story. Thats what the courts are for and thats where this should end."

845408,jedimaster,2014-04-03 20:18:00,3472,"Yes, and rightly so. Its a tough job. Its an honor to be allowed to be an officer and should be treated as such and I know it is by the vast majority. I very much respect the pains police go through, however its a chosen one and the scrutiny should be well documented and described as part of the job at the onset. I am not saying police should be hung from there heels in the middle of town square. Just as long as the bad apples are weeded out and its not swept under the table. Noone wants the good cops off the street. Just the crazies."

They are held accountable and have a system to curtail erratic behavior thru fines and penalties that can include criminal prosecution what more do you want? Sure they don't publish the results in the paper because it would undermine the polices image and most people would consider it boring.  The truth is that, despite all the training and practice, one never knows how a person will react in a given violent encounter. Especially a first time weapons encounter.  Will the shooter make one calculated and controlled shot, or will he lose control, let the adrenaline take over, and empty the magazine. In the moment it is all too easy  to let the ""rush"" take over.  I had small arms instructors with experience from both WW II and Korea who admitted they themselves had, in the heat of a fight, fire blindly in the direction of a target rather than pick a target (also known as the American method). Although this may explain the behavior, it does not excuse it. In my opinion the officer in question failed miserably In a fire fight the US military teaches us to aim for a target and if one is not visible to fire in the direction of the last known location to keep them from popping up and shooting back. While it cost a little more in ammo it has saved countless lives. Besides WE all love the smell of cordite in the morning. lol   Art"

I guess you're not in the firearms community? There are quite a few cases where legal firearms owners have received the good ole ""guilty until proven innocent"" treatment which results in a lengthy and expensive court process.  How about the RCMP entering homes during the Alberta flood and confiscating legal firearms?  Does the police brutality at the G20 summit ring a bell?    EDIT: Oops, let's not forget the RCMP changing the status of a couple firearms, simply because they felt like it, which in turn has resulted in many Canadians being in possession of $15,000,000 worth of firearms that are now only useful as paper weights.      I'm not against police, but the general opinion on this thread is that police in Canada are saints and that is false.

844927,Big Cliff,2014-04-01 21:39:00,6899,"I've been around this big ole country for a very long time and never once have I EVER had a problem with our police so I'm not too concerned if they pick up some new equipment if they think it's needed. X2  We the tax payer have already paid for them through the nose, I really don't want to see them scrapped for the metal. Lets put them to some good use!"
844928,fishing n autograph,2014-04-01 21:43:00,2540,Those armoured vehicles aren't free. I know YRP and London had to pay for them.  They are used for specific reasons and not for a police state. If you think that then give your head a shake. Those armoured vehicles are used to avoid what has happened with heavy armed people fleeing from police. I know London was te first to get theirs because of an incident involving a high speed chase with bandits armed with AK47s. Contrary to popular believe a rifle round will go through a cop car like a knife through warm butter.  They use as much gas as a transport truck and aren't driven on an everyday basis.
844929,fishing n autograph,2014-04-01 21:44:00,2540,There's a company in Newmarket that makes them as well as one in the London area
844931,porkpie,2014-04-01 21:55:00,2521,"Good use of tax dollars.  Already paid for in Canada, so if local Police can make use at a reasonable cost, have at it!"
844941,fish_fishburn,2014-04-01 22:36:00,1311,Maybe using the term Police State wasn't proper and sorry if I offended anyone. But cops with this stuff to me is wrong. Just because some bandit once in a blue moon has a AK-47. So does this mean we need to outfit our cops with military equipment?. If the equipment from the military is good enough to give away to police forces it would probably be better used if they handed it out to the militia (Reserve)  units across the country that are in deplorable shape for kit. They would love to have those vehicles for training. And that's what they were built for. Just because they do it in States and other countries doesn't mean its required here. Last time I checked we were in Canada. Just my opinion.
844944,fishing n autograph,2014-04-01 22:42:00,2540,"Armed conflicts in the GTa and running into armed offenders happens more than you realize and more than the media releases. I'd rather be prepared with the equipment for a once in a blue moon incident than attend a police funeral because the proper equipment wasn't there.  So you would rather have a call out to part time soldiers who may live an hour or more away to deal with a situation occurring than well trained ERU or ""SWAT"" officers who are better trained and train more often than reservists?"
844945,BillM,2014-04-01 22:45:00,17367,"If that helps the boys in blue be a bit safer on the job, then I'm all for it.   I'm sure some tinfoil hat folks think the apocalypse is on it's way."
844951,aplumma,2014-04-01 23:05:00,6896,I am happy we have them in in the states. A strong deterrent is always better than a full blown conflict. One of the things that keeps people from being buttheads down here is you don't know if the guy you so quickly want to have a fight with has as we say brought a gun to a knife fight. This is not a thought pattern that everyone has but it is one that I was raised with so it does not offend me. I did a tour in the military with the special forces (SeaBees) so everyone can choose their beliefs and express them publicly.   Art
844972,manitoubass2,2014-04-01 23:44:00,11391,"I guess im one of those ""tinfoil hat"" guys bill refers too lol. Dont get me wrong, in really hard situations i would be happy if the police have the necessary equipment to be safe, as long as it's not abused. More and more i see police in military gear with military equipment and too me thats just scary. Wouldn't be as worrisome if the government would leave our gun rights alone. Anyhow, in my area the police are pretty awesome, never seen or heard of much negative."

845023,fish_fishburn,2014-04-02 02:14:00,1311,I don't want to see cops getting killed either. But they all know what can happen when they sign up. If you cant handle the heat get out of the kitchen. If you want to act like soldiers then join the D.N.D. All this will do is make the bad guys get bigger weapons like R.P.G's it never ends.
845024,fishing n autograph,2014-04-02 02:16:00,2540,Apparently we can't use water canons
845025,fishing n autograph,2014-04-02 02:18:00,2540,Who's acting like a soldier? The armoured vehicles aren't driven daily like cruisers. They're used in emergency situations. No one but ERU and K9 wear tactical uniforms. So I don't see anyone playing GI Joe
