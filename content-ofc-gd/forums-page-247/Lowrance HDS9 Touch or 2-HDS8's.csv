Im looking to buy either Lowrance 2-HDS 8'' with Structure scan Used or 1-HDS 9"" Touch brand new for the same money......i have never used either other than in store. If anyone has experiences with the 2 units any help/advice would be greatly appreciated cheers"
844413,Garnet,2014-03-30 15:44:00,2056,I assume you are talking Gen 2. The touch screen is diffidently faster. Not a big issue for me so I stay with gen 2. Couple my fishing buddy's have touch and they wouldn't go back.

844507,Pguzik,2014-03-30 23:32:00,34,yeah the 8's are Gen2.
844569,linweir,2014-03-31 04:32:00,202,I'd rather to take 2 HDS 8 if they are in good shape.

I have used a 7, not an 8 on my friends boat, and only messed with the touch screens in the stores.  I would go touch without hesitation if I could afford it.  Having said that, I have no real world experience with a touch."
844603,RickOnt,2014-03-31 13:49:00,669,I have a HDS 8 Gen 2 at the helm. and a HB portable at the bow.  When I set this up the plan was to upgrade the HB to a HDS 7.  However what I have found is I seldom fish on the bow!  With the remote control for the Mnnkota  Ii am in the back of the boat looking at the HDS 8'  So unless you really spend a lot of time in the bow  My recommendation would be the  HDS 9 at the Helm  Have Fun Shoppin Rick
