A low pressure system forming over Colorado is expected to track northeast and intensify into a major winter storm as it reaches Lake Superior Monday night. Snow at times heavy is expected to develop Monday morning and continue throughout the day. Snow is likely to be mixed with ice pellets at times with a risk of freezing rain.  Current indications suggest that 15 to 25 centimetres of snow are possible for regions in the snowfall warning. Local blowing snow reducing visibility is also likely.  Travellers should consider changing their plans as driving conditions will quickly deteriorate and become hazardous after the snow moves in on Monday.  The winter storm will end on Tuesday as the storm centre tracks from Lake Superior to James Bay.

Roads are dry so today I'm removing the winter tires and putting on the summer ones, so that should guarantee a snow storm in the next few days."
