Anyone interested in a multi boat scouting mission in may up there. Lots of good looking bays in the South Bay area. Landry Isn't it funny how what works for one doesn't work for another? I've tried the Gulp minnows and didn't do well on them at all and knocked the heck out of the crappie with the FinS ones. I wonder how all the variables affect the productivity of any given bait.  Hook size, line weight, line color, even the type of line. I have seen this with a lot of different baits over the years to the point where I have had two rods rigged with exactly the same bait but different line combinations, the one rod would be producing, the other rod wouldn't get a hit. Even how you tie some lures on to your line seems to make a huge difference. I have one lure that I love to use for spring walleye, if I attach it with a swivel I'll still get some fish but if I tie it directly on to the line it will out fish live bait every time (Beans can tell you, he has seen it first hand).  We have even had two guys fishing side by side with the same lure, one guy hamering them, the other guy lucky to get a hit.  I remember fishing in Quinty one spring with a very good friend, (side by each in the same boat) he couldn't get a hit for love or money and I was just pounding them. I finally took my lure off and gave it to him, he still couldn't get a hit. Only thing different was our line/rod configuration. I'd love to know the science behind all of this! I have seen it happen too often for it to just be blind luck!"
844277,aplumma,2014-03-29 21:42:00,6896,Cliff I have often fished with my brother Joe using the same bait and him even showing me the cadence of his retrieves and he out fished me easily two to one. It has to do with something subtle even to the point of 1/2 second slack line at the beginning for a foot of extra depth to lifting the rod and extra 2 foot on a jig out. When we have a pattern that is producing we actually will call out the cadence  till the other one of us starts to catch fish.    Art

843268,Big Cliff,2014-03-25 10:44:00,6899,"X2. If the FinS minnows or smaller shad bodies aren't working that means there are no fish! Lunker City makes them. Arkansas Shiner is my #1 color choice. I also think there jigheads are the best jigheads on the market and I only fish the unpainted ones. I have tried a lot of different things over the years but FinS minnows are by far the best producer! (although I do use colored jig heads)  As for places to look for them; back bays, canals, marine basins (if they will let you fish there). Don't be afraid to fish shallow, I often find them in as little as 2' of water early spring.  Also play with your line depth below your float, sometimes 6"" more or less line can make a huge difference even over 3 or 4' of water.  I find that they seem to be most active when the water temperature is between 58 and 62°F, doesn't mean you won't catch them outside that but if you and find them in that temperature range you are going to be catching a lot more fish.  Lastly, if you are getting hits and they quit, try moving slightly one direction or the other, they tend to move as a school and sometimes if you just relocate a few feet you can stay on them."

843087,OhioFisherman,2014-03-24 15:36:00,6623,"Far and away the best thing I used for Crappie was Emerald Shiners fished on a spreader under a float. Even on lakes here that didn't have a natural Emerald Shiner population they were the way to go. Bait stores here away from Lake Erie tended to sell fat head minnows or creek chubs for bait, the Emerald Shiners would catch more Crappie if you could find them or bring them.  Lures? A two inch sassy shad or power grub on a 1/8 ounce jig head, a Road Runner, small tubes."
843095,crappieperchhunter,2014-03-24 16:14:00,2582,FinS minnows. That is all.  S. X2. If the FinS minnows or smaller shad bodies aren't working that means there are no fish! Lunker City makes them. Arkansas Shiner is my #1 color choice. I also think there jigheads are the best jigheads on the market and I only fish the unpainted ones.

843101,BowSlayer101,2014-03-24 16:41:00,296,"i like the Fins minnows as well, I've had good success with a small buckshot under a float as well, as mentioned above, the crappies will usually hit anything they can fit into their mouths in the spring, I've caught them on spinners, crank baits, jigs, pretty much everything, experiment a little, sometimes i find only the small ones will hit the tubes or minnows so i try a spinner, sometimes its the opposite, all part of the fun!"
843107,mike rousseau,2014-03-24 17:33:00,4661,So from the sounds of it if I'm not catching I most likely need to move around more then switch baits...  I only know a few areas that hold crappie and they're pretty well known in this area (shore spots)... I really want to try to find a new area I can target by boat and get some privacy...
843110,BillM,2014-03-24 17:48:00,17367,The one thing I've noticed about spring crappies is if you're 10ft outside of the 'zone' you aren't getting bit.
843113,mike rousseau,2014-03-24 17:55:00,4661,Kinda makes it hard to find a new spot with 30+ miles of river and creeks/tribs... Lol  One thing going for me is they seem to hit the creeks and hold in back bays.... I just have to find more creeks with back bays/canals
843115,bassjnkie,2014-03-24 18:11:00,1101,"1.75"" OMG Fry's or 2.5"" Minnow Meenie's  for Crappie from http://slamxbaits.com/.."
843122,Sinker,2014-03-24 18:53:00,8692,"Yes, this. Sometimes the zone is much smaller than 10ft too.  You can fish a back bay and not have a float go down once, then find that one spot where you get one every cast. Sneaky fish those crappies.  I also like 2"" white berkely power grubs, but the finS minnows usually work just as good. Colours vary depending on light conditions usually.  One thing that is for sure. If you catch one, there is more. I""ve never just caught one crappie. Fish that area really well, and figure them out, because they are there.  S."
843126,BillM,2014-03-24 19:07:00,17367,"Yup, you really gotta pick apart your spots.. You miss one little section and that's exactly where they could be     I love spring crappie fishing!"
843141,aplumma,2014-03-24 19:59:00,6896,I tip a jig with a rubber tube and a meal worm and slow troll behind the boat. Once I get a bite I drop a marker and back off and cast back to the school.   Art
843152,dave524,2014-03-24 20:38:00,4508,"Really early look for black bottoms, the water is warmer. There is also big prespawn bluegills there."

I really want to try to find a new area I can target by boat and get some privacy... i fish mostly from shore and my spots are hardly known, the most I've seen is 2 guys there and i knew both. You just gotta search for spots like that, in between boat channels, etc."
843186,moxie,2014-03-24 22:58:00,1566,"Tubes and small cranks, almost exclusively. Also found slowly swimming a small walleye type twister tail grub on a jig head works great to trigger strikes. Been a while since I've used live bait when targeting Crappie."
843221,porkpie,2014-03-25 00:43:00,2521,"I tie my own black and white marabou jigs with a bit of tinsel flash.  They do double duty for steelhead and spring panfish, and the bulk of my spring panfish are caught on them.  I seldom use live bait, but on rare occasion live emeralds rigged under a slip float are what it takes to get it done!"
843239,buckster,2014-03-25 01:45:00,530,"2"" pearl white grub is my go to bait.   I find that my baits vary depending on the lake.  Anyone else find that?"
