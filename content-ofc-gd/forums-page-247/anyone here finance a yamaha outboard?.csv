844500,Lunatic,2014-03-30 22:51:00,536,if so what are you paying for an interest rate? im reading that outboard sales are rough so they charge north of 20% which is just insane. if this is the case yamaha is the last place ill be going through for financing. i ask because i dont want soft hits on my credit finding out what their rates are like.
844511,porkpie,2014-03-30 23:55:00,2521,"No I have never financed a recreational item, generally preferring my credit line when I have done in the past.  Most recreational products the rates are much higher, even if you have exceptional credit, but 20 percent???  I can't imagine they would ever sell one through their own financing.  They should give you a ballpark rate for someone with good credit without any kind of check, soft or otherwise.  You know if your credit is good, bad or in the middle.   Good luck!"
844524,BillM,2014-03-31 00:19:00,17367,"Get a secured line of credit, purchase the motor that way..  Simple stuff."
844528,irishfield,2014-03-31 00:23:00,26272,Keep stuffing the cookie jar and buy when it's got enough in it...
844531,Rod Caster,2014-03-31 00:30:00,5784,"20% is insane.  I had one Yamaha dealer offer me 3.99% on a new ATV, 3yr term.  I imagine you could find 5-8% quite easily from the dealers....generally they want financing now because they make money on the financing. I offered ""cash"" for an ATV and they said they preferred financing.  Not sure you'd get much better than 5-6% on a secured LOC.  Wayne's suggestion is best, but not always easy to do.... I ended up buying  a used ATV to avoid indebtedness."
844538,BillM,2014-03-31 00:52:00,17367, Not sure you'd get much better than 5-6% on a secured LOC.    I'm paying less then prime on my SECLOC....
844542,Lunatic,2014-03-31 01:13:00,536,ive really got no debts. my credit is good.so i dont mind financing an outboard but i wont if the rates are crazy.
844554,NANUK,2014-03-31 01:46:00,797,Keep stuffing the cookie jar and buy when it's got enough in it...  The best way to buy toys !!
844556,DRIFTER_016,2014-03-31 01:57:00,10439,â€‹I re-powered my boat last summer and just went to my bank for the $$$. Got a pretty decent % rate too. 6 or 7 I think.
844574,Old Ironmaker,2014-03-31 06:30:00,8243,"It's never a good idea to finance a toy, it's actually a very, very,bad idea. I don't know where you heard 20% interest rate. I'd imagine that rate for someone with terrible credit. Don't finance a toy, buy what you can afford or don't buy it. A vehicle to get you back and forth to work and serves a real purpose I can see but never something like an ATV unless you need it for business. If you don't have enough equity to get a line of credit where they don't care what you do with the money you can't afford this purchase.  Edit, I just read your profile and your interests, Harleys, cars and drinking? You can't afford a new ATV. I sound like my old man!"
844577,Fisherman,2014-03-31 10:23:00,7201,"Sure thing, everyone wants their toys up front without saving.  Like Old Ironmaker said, if it's not work related, it's not needed."
844587,Rod Caster,2014-03-31 12:31:00,5784,"I'm closer to 5 on my SELOC... maybe I need to talk to someone...I did just buy the house and had to do clever financing due to the large acreage which is not considered 'equity', maybe thats why I didnt get best rate.  Anyway, Lunatic, if you can get 6 or below I'd say thats a decent rate for such an item."
844594,BillM,2014-03-31 12:55:00,17367,"Yeah, anything beats 20% through the dealer, lol!  That's just highway robbery."
844672,bare foot wader,2014-03-31 19:58:00,1354,"looking at a new toy right now, dealership said their lenders are around 6-7, but up to 29.99% for recreational items, depending on credit...I sure hope nobody ever signs off on 20% ouch, most lenders will try to sell you on monthly payments, don't fall for that  if you really want it, finance it, have some fun"
844690,Lunatic,2014-03-31 21:06:00,536,"not sure why this has become a moral lesson on savings..... as for cars,harleys and drinking,i suppose i should update my profile since i no longer own the race car or the harley and im lucky to have time for a beer or 2 a week these days. not sure why an ATV came into this,also i probably could spring and pay for it all up front or at least a majority of it but i like to keep cash aside for emergencies.so a finance would be best for me i think. ,but thanks for all the opinions on the matter. its good to know that 20% is not yamahas norm for financing."
