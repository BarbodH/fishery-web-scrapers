844043,Jen,2014-03-28 20:31:00,833,Awesome looking job... A memory to last a lifetime for sure!
844045,misfish,2014-03-28 21:15:00,29133,You got a story about that Molson can award? Have not seen one of them before.  
844047,Bassnbows,2014-03-28 21:27:00,58,Sweet. They do such a great job.
844157,Moosebunk,2014-03-29 12:55:00,3970,"Looks good Mike.  Have thought about having Advanced do up the 56 I caught last Autumn... but first we've been putting off Bren's 21lb Arctic Char for some time.  They do both at once, I go broke. lol.  Nobody does replicas better, and it feels right releasing those particular fish back to their waters.  As you can relate with the muskie you set free."
844320,Handlebarz,2014-03-30 01:29:00,3790,Thanks rizzo Jen bassnbows and bunk just go for it if you want you can make payments it will be 6 months or better before its ready so a few bucks a months it will be paid off before you know it.
844670,jimmer,2014-03-31 19:50:00,2730,Misfish: I got it from my daughter. It says greatest dad in the world. Probably not what you were expecting. LOL
843042,Handlebarz,2014-03-24 09:55:00,3790,Thanks Pete I remember that pic above that is a great looking mount also.
843053,Renegade67,2014-03-24 12:24:00,86,Very nice mount Mike!   Pete is right on the money on all the positive factors in getting a replica.  Nice mount as well! There are the purist who feel the only mount worthy is a skin mount but they just won't stand the test of time.   I have a walleye on the wall from advanced that was done very early in their career.  Its 25 years old and it looks like the day I received it!   I've had to clean it a couple of times and its amazing how durable the finish is.   My brother and friends have had mounts done as well over the years and they just got better.  Especially with inside the mouth and gill details.    Its best to take lots of pictures as soon as you can.  They are masters in painting every detail. I'm still hunting for a G Bay ski over 50!  If I get one its only a five minute drive to their current location.  Always nice to have an excuse to drop in and see what is in their show room waiting for pick-up.
843080,jimmer,2014-03-24 14:58:00,2730,Replicas are more expensive that skin mounts. I'm thinking I should have stayed in the business if that's what it cost to have a replica done. LOL
843108,Handlebarz,2014-03-24 17:43:00,3790,Thanks 67 replicas are very durable  Jimmer I wish I had talent to do them it would be a great business
843111,mike rousseau,2014-03-24 17:52:00,4661,"Wow... $1400 with no background art...  That's getting expensive...  My dad got a 54"" done with driftwood and rock/sand lake bottom etc... for $1000... But that was 20 years ago..."
843118,lew,2014-03-24 18:28:00,12766,"Just for comparison, I paid $125 for a 45"" skin mount 4 decades ago.  Seemed like a lot of $$$$ way back then.  "
843121,mistaredone,2014-03-24 18:41:00,913,Very nice!
843140,aplumma,2014-03-24 19:54:00,6896,"Just for comparison, I paid $125 for a 45"" skin mount 4 decades ago.  Seemed like a lot of $$$$ way back then.   Is that a smile breaking thru Lew?   Art"
843144,lew,2014-03-24 20:09:00,12766,"Is that a smile breaking thru Lew?   Art  Nope, I had gas."
843164,misfish,2014-03-24 21:12:00,29133,Im glad Im not the only one that thought I looked trimmer and a studster in my younger years Lew.  Great photo. Not meaning to high jack yer thread here Sir Parker.
843166,manitoubass2,2014-03-24 21:15:00,11391,Absolutely beautiful!!!
843212,Handlebarz,2014-03-25 00:16:00,3790,Mike things have changed huge in 20 years with the replicas I did not want a background so I could easily use it for display at our booth.
843215,Handlebarz,2014-03-25 00:21:00,3790,No biggie it's nice to see old mounts and how far things have come with what they can do from pictures. We have two old skin mounts here that are 25 years old and show it one is a SM bass the other a perch both cost less then $30 mounted on wood they hold a huge place in my heart but they look their age.  If anyone wants to share there fish in this thread please do I love to see them I will post the other two tomorrow or later in the week. I will also repost dads walleye I had done at advanced for him.
843218,Tim Mills,2014-03-25 00:33:00,476,Looks great and an excellent conversation pc for your home.  Even better knowing its a replica.
843242,kickingfrog,2014-03-25 01:55:00,8333,"The farther back we go, the smaller we were and the fish bigger."
843278,outllaw,2014-03-25 11:41:00,1232,"beauty mike. if the mount fades send her in. I will make it any custom color free of charge lmao.. or do each side different ,"
843284,SmokestackLightnin,2014-03-25 12:05:00,390,"Congratulations on the fish and the mount.  One of the concerns I have with replica mounts is what they are, a replica.  For me, they loose the realistic charm that a skin mount provides.  There is no doubt that Shawn and James at Advanced are very good at what they do, and many think they are the best, I don't dispute that.  I think the reason why skin mounts get a lot of bad press is because there are a lot of bad skin mounts out there.  Around 25 years ago I signed up for a special interest night course on taxidermy at a Toronto high school and it was there I met Grant.  He seemed passionate about his craft and confident in his ability.  He always stressed quality.  The next year he held the class in his shop at Queen and Ossington and what an experience that was.  Anyway, making a long story short, with Grant's help I did a skin mount on an 8lb walleye which to this day looks as good as the day it was completed.  I even used the real gills.  IMO nothing beats a properly done skin mount.  I could only find a couple pictures of it where it now temporarily rests as you can see from the one photo, I am in the middle of renovating my cottage.  "
843407,Handlebarz,2014-03-25 20:33:00,3790,George I would love to send a fish over for you to paint I'm know that it would be an original tie die musky
843654,jimmer,2014-03-26 17:04:00,2730,Skin mounts can be very good if done properly; you just have to go to some of the taxidermy competitions to see the quality that some can put out. It's all in the quality of supplies used and the skill of painting. Even replicas can be critiqued to show the flaws. They just don't shrink and stretch with changes in humidity. I will post some pictures if I can figure out how to do it on a reply.
843655,Maverick,2014-03-26 17:09:00,371,That is massive! Good job getting the replica and letting that monster swim another day.
843665,jimmer,2014-03-26 18:15:00,2730,   Just experimenting with trying to get photos on here. Sorry for redirecting the focus away from the beautiful replica of your trophy Mike P. These have been mounted for years.
843694,Handlebarz,2014-03-26 20:46:00,3790,"Skin mounts can look great but no matter what a fish has to be kept. I have a couple old skin mounts but when it came to a musky if this size there is no way I am keeping one to save money on a skin mount. It takes so many years for that big girl to get to 54"" it's the same as dads walleye we let it go and he kept some smaller ones for lunch.  I don't know that I will get another done for myself but if my wife or kids want one of a big fish they will get I know I will buy them one."
843741,Rizzo,2014-03-26 23:19:00,4754,she's a beauty! Someday I'll splurge...just waiting for a fish that big!
843794,Handlebarz,2014-03-27 01:48:00,3790,Keep looking they will show up I had alot if hours in to get this one
844040,jimmer,2014-03-28 20:11:00,2730,"I would also never keep a muskie that large, or any other muskie. That's the biggest benefit of replicas. This big ones get to live and fight another day."
842913,Handlebarz,2014-03-23 17:37:00,3790,Well I got my musky back from Advanced Taxidermy yesterday and I must say I am again totally blown away by the work that Shawn and James along with the staff do over there. Here are some pics I took from the shop and after getting it home.  As usual the pictures never do these things justice and I just used my phone to take the pics.
842919,Squid,2014-03-23 17:49:00,1656,Nice looking fish Mike!
842921,Musky or Specks,2014-03-23 17:51:00,2710,They do such fantastic work. Very nice fish.
842922,misfish,2014-03-23 18:02:00,29133,Nice Mike.  Replica?
842924,kickingfrog,2014-03-23 18:10:00,8333,Very nice. Just need to have 8lb walleye in its jaws.
842926,muskymatt,2014-03-23 18:16:00,2608,"Awesome Mike, that bait you sent me hopefully will pay off with a biggie like that! Can't wait to use it, it's very purdy!  "
842927,pairofgreenhorns,2014-03-23 18:18:00,133,Looks great. What's the price range on those?
842928,Handlebarz,2014-03-23 18:28:00,3790,Thanks guys Yes Brian it's a replica I had them leave out lamprey marks and do a custom eye that is the great thing the big fish is still swimming and I have the memory in the living room.  I did ask James if they had any perch crappie bluegill around but they did not. I will one day get a cluster of baitfish to have on the wall in front of it.  Matt kick some musky azz with it.  It's around $1400 for this size fish. It depends what kind of fish and how big it is.
842932,davey buoy,2014-03-23 18:37:00,5505,That's some nice work!!!. Looks awesome Mike.How big was that again?Remember that picture but not the sizes.
842933,misfish,2014-03-23 18:39:00,29133,  Thats cool..
842939,lew,2014-03-23 19:32:00,12766,Nice Mike
842947,Handlebarz,2014-03-23 20:31:00,3790,"Thanks Dave and Lew it was 54"""
842950,Joey,2014-03-23 20:43:00,9122,Impressive Mike.  Really nice work they did on that.  You must be thrilled!
842955,Ron,2014-03-23 21:28:00,1683,Very nice Mike! Now we just have ta wait to see Dana's 55 incher....
842957,Joeytier,2014-03-23 21:42:00,3990,"Amazing job.  Worth every penny for the lifetime of enjoyment you will get ouy of it, unlike those flaky skin mounts"
842968,Handlebarz,2014-03-23 22:41:00,3790,"Yes Joey totally thrilled it looks killer the only fight we have is Danna does not like the lure in the mouth.  Ron I control the bump board and for her fish it stops at 53 7/8""  Joeutier your right this will be around long after I'm gone"
842969,Joey,2014-03-23 22:45:00,9122,"I don't know, I kinda like the lure in its mouth Mike.  Paul has one hanging from the pickerel on our wall."
842970,Gallie,2014-03-23 22:54:00,1215,Beautiful fish and very nice work!
842971,206,2014-03-23 23:14:00,563,Neat!  1400 for replica how much would it cost to stuff the actual fish??
842973,spincast,2014-03-23 23:17:00,3279,Damn that's big. Nice job
842979,Handlebarz,2014-03-23 23:48:00,3790,Thanks Joey I will use that as ammo when we battle it out one day lol.  Thanks Gallie and Spin  206 they charge the same price.
842981,Terry,2014-03-23 23:53:00,14456,great looking fish
842986,Whopper,2014-03-24 00:16:00,2174,Nice looking mount Mr Parker.
843003,Handlebarz,2014-03-24 01:09:00,3790,Thanks Terry and Phil.
843020,Fisherpete,2014-03-24 02:32:00,1814,"Wow, it looks awesome Mike!  In 2004, I was just getting into muskie fishing and caught my first good one - a 45"". Being a newbie, I thought it was the fish of a lifetime and had a replica done at Advanced too... well I have beat 45"" a number of times since then LOL but am still happy that I had it made, it looks exactly as good today as the day I took it home. I probably won't have another made until I push well into the 50"" range...  Andrew had his 55"" LOTW giant done there as well, with an amazing background of driftwood and rock... looks incredible. Their work is second to none, and anyone considering getting a mount should visit their studio/workshop first. I saw their work at a fishing show, and decided then and there that if I ever had a replica made, it would be by them.  206 - replicas often are far more expensive than having the actual fish stuffed, but there are a number of benefits to doing so. A replica will not shrink or discolour as natural oils etc. come out of the fish. If you were ever to damage it, they can repaint or repair it. And most importantly, the fish can be released alive to be caught again - all they need to make a replica is a picture(s) and measurements.            "
