845415,captpierre,2014-04-03 20:51:00,2521,Beauti fish.  I've fished at the powerplants at Niagara.  Until I heard a few years ago a charter lost 2 guests overboard as the boat got partially sucked under by the current.  1 drowned I believed.  Can anyone confirm this?
845422,Aaron Shirley,2014-04-03 21:54:00,655,"Actually Captpierre, I was fishing below the dams when that incident occurred that day. I saw the guide boat floating down River upside down with the Coast Guard boat beside it. A Sheriff's boat approached us and told us what happened and asked us to keep an eye out for 2 bodies. We didn't see them. They took a week to surface I believe. I felt sick about it for a while. From what I was told,  the guide and a woman lost their lives that day. Her fianc√© lived. From what I understand, the guide boat got sucked backward into a big whirlpool that opened up. Another boat nearby was able to rescue the one man.  It is a very dangerous place to fish, especially if one doesn't know the water well. It is even dangerous for people that know it, and a lot of caution must be taken. Ever since that incident, I take extra precautions when I travel above the dams and insist everyone wear a flotation suit or pfd. I know the water well, but anything can happen up there. The Niagara River must be respected, especially above Queenston."
