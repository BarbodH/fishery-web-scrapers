Terry and I had a few hours to fish this morning,so we hit a new spot to us and gave it a try. Lots of holes and little rewards. I did manage to get a feed for my lunch today. Im back on this fresh water fish then again. FRESH IS GOOD.  On my way to our spot,I came accross a yote in a corn field. Then I see this other moving animal further out. From the long distance,I thought it was a deer. It was large in size.I decided to pull over and watch to see what was about to unfold.  Lighting was bad,so pic, didnt turn out great. The yote seems to be stalking the other out in the field. After about 2 minutes or so,it became clear the other animal was a very large yote. One of the biggests I have seen.This is probly a 300 yard shoot to the one in the open field.  First yote    Second one I thought was a deer the first was stalking.   So back to heading to the ice hook up. Walking was great,if you had cleats. They sure are worth their weight in gold.  We fished for about 4 hours drilling many holes looking for yellow bellies,but they didnt seem to in the biten mood..  Managed just enough perch and pike bait (  HH ) for a snack for my lunch. All caught on the skud.    There was this pressure crack that I wanted investigate and see if I could take some good pics.  South to north.      Some random shots.      Thought these two looked like wings.    Inside the crack.    This I thought was my coolest shot. You can see the layers in which the leaf has melted in.     Frozen in time.    Hope to get out one more time for some perch,til then it,s lunch time   "
