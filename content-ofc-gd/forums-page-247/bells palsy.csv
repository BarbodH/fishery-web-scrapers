844443,bow slayer,2014-03-30 18:23:00,1074,anyone have any first hand experience with this condition. Just had a close family member come down with this.They have been told to expect a full recovery in about 2 -3 weeks. Though there is a small chance at permnament damage. Has only been through this. I have heard it is quite common.
844445,tb4me,2014-03-30 18:42:00,3295,I have a friend that has recovered from it. He had to go thru therapy to learn to deal with stress. Stress is the silent killer..Your family member needs to slow down and enjoy life..

It took about 2-3 weeks before the effects were gone.Full recovery. Then again,theres an old friend from work that was striken with it. This was 10 years ago. I see him now and then,and you can still see the effects. Body function is normal,but his facial is noticeable."

Now he only has a relapse every time he gets divorced. The wife needs to slow down just like 2b4me. Easier said then done I know."
