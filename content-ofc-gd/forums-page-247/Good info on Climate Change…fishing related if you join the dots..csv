845038,knightfisher,2014-04-02 03:53:00,237,"Cram just a guess, but if oil and such have been found up there, as I already answered earlier, major countries want a piece of it. China growing as quickly as they are need any and all resources they can to keep their economy going. No pretending, these countries are always looking, whether on land, ice or water.  Hope I answered your questions. Not trying to change your mind. Some of my points and Irishfield's are pretty good fodder for thought. Do with it what you will.     you must be wearing the same tinfoil hat as i. Pretty obvious gnarly things are being done by government and corporations. In my area, they are spraying over treaty land that has tons of mining potential. Something else to speculate about, lol. Always like looking outside the box.

I stated in my second post the climate is changing. I don't believe the ice melts are due to CO2.  The planet is in constant change. We have had five ice ages. After that comes the warming. It's a constant cycle of change. To think a simple gas is going to change the entire planet...to me is the biggest joke put to mankind. Really a simple gas is causing all this....blah"

845086,EC1,2014-04-02 15:14:00,930,"Geo-engineering is like praying on a magic diet pill instead of eating healthy and excercising. ""Let's use more oil and chemicals to try and neutralize our use of oil!"" I don't think the chemicals are what's going to kill us, but instead our dependency on oil.  Every single person living in modern society is dependent on oil. Your paper Timmy's cup, proudly paddled across the Pacific, right? And when you're done with that cup, someone out there will walk a plastic bag full of garbage straight to the landfill, another few hundred kilometres away.  http://www.bp.com/liveassets/bp_internet/globalbp/globalbp_uk_english/reports_and_publications/statistical_energy_review_2011/STAGING/local_assets/pdf/BP_World_Energy_Outlook_booklet_2013.pdf Even BP has an energy outlook saying that oil use will be much less by 2030. Perhaps they want to make less revenue and sell less gas? Or is it that we're just actually running low on supplies? Even if we use less oil, there are plans for more use of shale gas (Fracking - Look it up if you're not familiar!) and other nasty forms fo energy.  Whether you choose to believe that climate change is true or not, human society as a whole is pointing straight towards destruction. Humanity would end from 2 causes, either we destroy the environment so bad that the food and water poisons us, or the instant we run out of oil. It's not a 2012, or Y2K where you're given a date, it's just that when it happens you'll know it.  To say that we can find an alternative to oil, what do we do to feed to all of the people that are out of jobs in car manufacturing? What about the lithium powered car and all the oil that was used to bring each part into the factory? And all of the plastic in the interiors that we love so much?  This is fishing related, because a dead man can't fish"
