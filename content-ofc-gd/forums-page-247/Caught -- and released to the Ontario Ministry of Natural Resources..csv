To bad so sad..  http://mnrwatch.com/minnesota-angler-pleads-guilty-loses-potential-world-record-lake/  I keep wondering why they are saying world record.. i could see Ontario record, but surely someone has caught something bigger say in the NWT??"
844815,chris.brock,2014-04-01 12:31:00,4053,"I think they say ""world record"" for added drama, but it's a line class record"
844816,TJQ,2014-04-01 12:32:00,7806,Thats what I figured... but even still... theres MONSTERS up north..
844817,bushart,2014-04-01 12:36:00,2628,"Something about a ""Tip-Up"" world record?????  Is that like a Friday afternoon world record???  Anyway--nice fish---good fight thru ice"
844824,porkpie,2014-04-01 13:12:00,2521,"There is only one type of record that matters.  All tackle!  The rest, well..."
844829,Stoty,2014-04-01 13:40:00,2910,"So all these ""world records"" that people are claiming might be illegal/Bull...........................NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO.  "
844848,bushart,2014-04-01 15:46:00,2628,I'm the current record holder on One eyed pike while fishing in an east wind---holding my rod with my left hand and wearing prescription sunglasses

844853,bushart,2014-04-01 15:55:00,2628,I'm just kid'n round TJ.....I think the way that ad you posted was wrote was a specific trout line or tip up record---??  Not sure  I did see the world record Laker mounted in the Winnipeg airport many years ago-----a huge fat bellied football just over the 100 lb mark  caught in a net I believe
844854,OhioFisherman,2014-04-01 15:57:00,6623,"http://www.lakersunlimited.com/gallery3/Lakers-Lunkers/File0009  In a net though, I thought Great Bear or Great Slave lakes were known for huge lakers?"
844858,SmokestackLightnin,2014-04-01 16:09:00,390,"FYI, any IGFA record must be caught on a rod 40"" or longer so a tip-up would not qualify for an IGFA record.  Not sure who is the source behind the ""tip-up world record""."
844862,bushart,2014-04-01 16:32:00,2628,Maybe that record was started by manufacturers of Tip ups
