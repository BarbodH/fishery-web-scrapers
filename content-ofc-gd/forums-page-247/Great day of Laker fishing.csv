Once we got to the lake it was beautiful out lol. JM caught a couple beauties, great fight with plenty of reel screaming runs.      32"" of ice , it's going to be around for a while.  "

844509,muskymatt,2014-03-30 23:46:00,2608,"This was a new lake to us, to bag a couple fatties the first outing was very satisfying. JM's pb thru the ice and an awesome hot lunch cooked on the ice, along with a sunny afternoon, it was awesome. JM and I were 8' apart and he had all the luck lol, exact same baits. It was still nice wetting the hand pulling them out for him. That lake is officially on the must do again soon list "

844564,Moosebunk,2014-03-31 03:41:00,3970,First time there Matt!!!???  Great job today for you and JM.  It's a well stocked lake that fishes best in winter... probably because it's dirty water lakers fish quite tough during the softwater season.  One time I'll have to head up with you both.
