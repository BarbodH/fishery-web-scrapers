844880,esoxansteel,2014-04-01 18:18:00,1307,"Very late spring, still lots of snow up river, and ice keeping water temps cool for jumping, water temp was 35 degrees yesterday at 9.00am most of the fish are still in the lower river, and out in the lake waiting for the right conditions. Likely about a week to 10 days away from the peak, back in the 1980s the MNR did shut down the lower river after the opener for an extra week due to the late spring and the majority of fish still in the lower river below the dam. Keep in mind the run is about 50% of what it was back then"
844912,craigdritchie,2014-04-01 20:12:00,1586,"You generally need water temps in the very high 40s or better yet, 50s to get fish to jump at fishways. If the current temp is 35 (which I believe, given how much snow and ice is still melting) then you'll need to be patient yet."
844915,Sinker,2014-04-01 20:34:00,8692,Has the ice even broke up above the dam? I dont think it has. Wont be fish jumping for a while yet.  S.
