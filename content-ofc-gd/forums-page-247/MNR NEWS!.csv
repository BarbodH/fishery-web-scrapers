Ive noticed that there is no real place where we can see whats going on with the MNR province wide so here ya go:   For many years now Ontario’s Ministry of Natural Resources (MNR) staff have had to learn how to continue to effectively manage our Fish and Wildlife resources with less revenue. Amazingly they are still doing an incredible job. MNR Watch is a compilation of MNR related news items and MNR’s activities across the province. The majority of items highlight MNR’s remarkable work, often in small local media outlets that otherwise most Ontarians would not see. MNR WATCH is not associated or endorsed in any way with the ministry itself. Users may use MNR Watch to see what the MNR is up to across the province. This website will also help detail how massive MNR service cuts are affecting the protection of Ontario’s wildlife, tourism, and resources.  Come on over and sign up for email updates or like us on facebook to get the news in your facebook feed!  http://mnrwatch.com/"
