My wife surprised me when I asked what she wanted to do for our 10th wedding anniversay this October, I totally assumed to hear Cuba, Mexico etc...but she once again surprised me and suggested a full meal plan fishing / cottage resort get away   I have always brought my own meals so I need suggestions to accomodate the wife's request of no cooking.  Ideally 4 hours or less drive from Durham region (willing to stretch this) Full meals provided Species would ideally be in no particular order: Walley, Bass, Pike"
