When the antidepressant was too mild for the prescription market, they sold it to the food sector. Now theres a million obese , angry people addicted to diet pop and chewing gum.  Margarine, an artificial product was originally invented as a cheap way to fatten turkeys for production. It was found that it actually made turkeys lose precious pounds... so it was instead marketed as the healthy alternative to butter.  Todays fun facts."

Were no longer expending calories/nutrients to keep warm, or gather food etc.  Some studies (real studies, double blind randomized) suggest that if you remove all other factors, calorie consumption is directly correlated to the length of ones life. And on top of that, metabolism is basically whats killing you, slowly. Again, if you remove all other factors.  To discuss these topics at large, you need to realize the variables are literally, EVERYTHING.  That being said, there is no real answer, only more questions ala science.  But, I enjoy learning. I also like to be aware of the world around me. I might be alone here, but I'd rather die knowledgeable then die ignorant.

What it comes down to is choises and sometimes you have to have the poop scared out of you to make up your mind. After being in a hospital bed for 8 weekes after flatlining l made my choise. 160 lbs. later l have never felt as good as l do now. l changed how l ate and l changed how l lived with stress.  l still have my treats but they are few and far. But white sugar and white bread is hardly consumed by me. Back in the early 1900`s the average person consumed 1-2 lbs of sugar a year and now the average person consumes 21 lbs a month. l also eat natural foods (unprocessed)and l ovoid as much as possible corn syrip but they are in my treats. And trail mix in my new potato chips. But these are my choises but going from 360+ lbs. to 200 lbs. has changed my life. It`s sad but l lost another person that l was carring around with me. Be informed about what you are putting into your body.  Oh ya l still eat Bacon.

732792,manitoubass2,2012-09-26 16:49:00,11391,"Yep, for bodybuilders, this act is all about nutrient partitioning. Nutrient partitioning in itself, is either anabolic (building) or catabolic (breaking down. For them at least, remaining in positive nutrient partitioning allows for greater growth of protein based tissues (muscle).  Another funny thing (quite disturbing actually) is the relationship people have with what they ingest. Without knowing, they are in effect, taking drugs. Now that might seem totally off base, but really it isn't. Alot of food humans ingest is for the pleasure/reward system ie neurotransmittor response, and not for the original intent, which would be overall health and fuel.  The reasons people might ""crave"" sugary based foods has little to do with your body telling you it needs said sugars. It's the effect those foods have on an intricate level within one cells, and the effect these foods have on dopamine and serotonin responses. These provoke ""drug like "" effects within the brain, which is itself is somewhat addictive.  The bodies version of ""needing"" something doesn't come in the form of ""cravings"", it comes in the form of cellular shutdowns. An example of this would be hypoglycemia.  More food for thought"

732799,manitoubass2,2012-09-26 17:00:00,11391," The brain uses glycogen to function, and within cells contains healthy fats that must be replenished to operate effectively.  Glycogen is obtained from proteins via glucogenisis. If you introduce a simple sugar artificially, the body adapts and will create glycogen for fuel use. Anything above what is needed will be stored, or converted to other metabolic functions, many of which are not optimal.  Glucose is not an efficient form of creating glycogen (well it is, but it creates unwanted problems)  Comparing coffee and sugar is a whole different beast. Caffeine is a stimulant, glycogen is a form of natural energy.  So, to begin your day, your goal should be to ingest healthy fats for brain function, and lean proteins for energy"

732815,manitoubass2,2012-09-26 17:19:00,11391," Again, that emphasizes the need for ingestion of healthy fats. They serve many roles in the body, such as protective sheaths around organs, production of steroidal hormones ei cholesterol, testosterone, estrogen, nortestosterone, and they play a huge role in healthy inflamation, which is then again correlated to protein synthesis, nutrient partitioning etc. Also for the brain to function.  Proteins are made up of amino acids. These amino acids are conditioned in the body to ""create"" what it seems fit, at the time of need. The body needs Glycogen? It makes it with amino acids. Time to sleep/recover/grow??? the body makes serotonin, then it makes melatonin to tell you when to sleep. Got an injury? Healthy fats start the healing process by controlling inflammation in a positive manner, then leucine is introduced to ""rebuild"" the muscle tissues surrounding the injury.  It's a very complicated, yet efficient and beautiful cellular system.  Corn syrup serves zero function in achieving health/function. It's a damaging cellular compound with no caloric benefit. It does help you eat more though, on the level that when your body isnt getting what it needs calorically, it wants to keep eating. It's the beginning of a deadly path.     "

Chances are, you will get full before you will get fat eating proper fats. If you're fat, you're eating too much oil or dairy fat somewhere in your diet. You won't get fat eating peanut butter.  Dairy fat is also very fattening to people, found in milk and cheese.  Dairy is much, much more damaging than grains. It's the only thing on the Food Pyramid that is 100% complete propaganda. It's not healthy for you. At all. Even raw, organic dairy from cows that get pampered from birth. Why? Because cow's milk has a very specific purpose on this planet. It's for BABY COWS! If you offered someone a grilled cheese sandwich, and after they ate it, you told them that the cheese was made from your neighbour's wife's breastmilk, they would probably be disgusted. Well at least that's human milk, meant for humans. Now just imagine how disgusting cow's milk is. Cows pumped with drugs and hormones to boot.  Dairy will cause you IBS, crohn's, UC, acne, BO, massive phlegm production, and many ailments that are improperly labeled as ""flus"" or ""colds"" are actually your immune system dealing with the toxicity in your body that is caused by ingesting..dairy.  Dairy is in everything, from bread, to candies, chips, coffee, desert, they even put it in sauces, breaded meat products, burgers, you name it. It's everywhere, it's physically addictive and is a drug that most people are addicted to. But big time mafia-like businesses make way too much money every second of the day selling it all over the place. Remember the drink milk love life ads?

732778,manitoubass2,2012-09-26 16:14:00,11391," This is the only time a person ""should"" ingest carbohydrates. But remember, ""post workout"" doesn't necessarily mean weightlifting. It would include any time after physical load ie cardiovascular type activities, or other physically demanding life events.  Simple sugars are the most effective at replenishing glycogen stores after physical events. Dextrose probably the most effective. Fructose is not very effective for this.  When insulin sensitivity is peak, the body is in prime nutrient storage mode. Its the one time where the only requirements should be lean proteins and simple sugars. The next meal after physical bouts, should again contain lean proteins, but focus on healthy fats, for many complicated reasons, but one simple reason is the prevent spikes in blood sugar, and slow nutrient partitioning to the bodies advantage.  One thing is for certain, humans need healthy fats and healthy proteins to live, and the quality of those proteins and fat are direct contributions to the quality of our lives.  Sugars are not needed, and never were. Glycogen is easily maintained by the body through glucogenisis. Using amino acids found in the ingested proteins, to convert them into usable forms of glycogen  That being said, I do ingest simple sugars after physical load because its my contribution to making my body more efficient in metabolism. Although it is not NEEDED, it does exhibit a positive influence on what I am achieving on a metabolic level  Sinclair has obviously done his homework. Your raising very valid points along the way. Good on you"
732566,Dave Bailey,2012-09-25 21:38:00,1641,This could be the gravest danger facing the world today; a very real possibility of a bacon shortage.  
732567,misfish,2012-09-25 21:41:00,29133,"Ah,they make turkey bacon,Im still good to go."
732569,solopaddler,2012-09-25 21:45:00,8605,A pork famine was predicted by the Mayans.  This is but the first in a series of catastrophic events culminating in armageddon on December 21.  God help us.
732571,Billy Bob,2012-09-25 21:55:00,5865,SEE.....I KNEW there was a good reason for our military build up.....  ....  BTW....I always like a good pig....Pamela Anderson is mine favorite...
732572,mercman,2012-09-25 22:01:00,7054,I'm not worried.I have many lbs of bacon that will keep me warm through the shortage
732573,backbay,2012-09-25 22:02:00,773,I'll be right back.....!
732576,tb4me,2012-09-25 22:09:00,3295,"Actually this is no laughing matter..What they don't report is its going to be same with all food, not just bacon. Take Beef for example..A very good friend of mine is a beef farmer. He has completely sold his livestock due to a feed shortage! He grew his own hey for many years now. The Army worms took the first cut of hey and the drought took the second cut. Its not just him..Hey went from on average 2 to 3 dollars a bale to upwards of 9 dollars a bale this fall. Some farmers are now trucking large round bales from Quebec for upwards of 90 bucks each! Do yourselves a huge favour and get a freezer full of meat..This time next year, it may not be so cheap.."
732580,Billy Bob,2012-09-25 22:18:00,5865," We got a BUTT LOAD of GOOSE in the freezer and more fish then I can possible cook...LOL....and duck season is just around the corner...PLUS deer season in November....no meat shortage here...but we have NO WILD Pigs here....  .... BTW my buddy purchased some bales of hey yesterday to get good in with this ""lady"" he knows that has goats.....he's expecting a roll in the hey with her...LOL....but I was with him yesterday after goose hunting and he didn't say anything about high prices on hey."
732584,Christopheraaron,2012-09-25 22:30:00,3525," goose, fish and lamb; what else does a person need!"
732586,Toad Hunter,2012-09-25 22:43:00,261,does this mean Timmies breaky sandwhiches will go up even more ?
732587,Fisherman,2012-09-25 22:44:00,7201,"Honestly, that stuffs not good for ya anyway, all the additives and processing chemicals the body can do without."
732588,Jigger,2012-09-25 22:45:00,1237,Sooo more people will turn to small scale agriculture and some will hunt and barter with the organic meat they harvested. Wheres the problem? Might have been more inclined to hit the three Turkeys i slowed down for earlier had i read this first. But i digress...
732592,i2cool2fool,2012-09-25 22:59:00,349,"This is horrible, outrageous news. What will I put on my toasted peanut butter sandwiches now!"
732598,adempsey,2012-09-25 23:07:00,1498,Pfffft...we'll always have TOFACON!!  
732600,GBW,2012-09-25 23:08:00,8460,"I think I just hear headhunter fall over, twice!  once from the OP and then when he got up to see a pic of TOFACON he fell again.  And I'm in Whitby and he isn't!"
732606,bushart,2012-09-25 23:37:00,2628,I heard that heavy doses of salt and nitrates are available in pill form now anyway  I blame this all on the Wendy's big bacon classic
732609,Skipper D,2012-09-25 23:52:00,1970,"HOG WASH all HOG WASH ... maybe , the artical said United Kingdom , thats where the problem is , then it go's on to say then it will be North Americas turn , i did'nt know we had the same  drout this year as the United Kingdom did , as far as i can remember from watching all season ( its my nature because i am a farm boy ) all our crop are in excelent shape this year , and for once the prices being paid for them is decent for a change , next time your driving thru the country take a look at the feilds for your selfs , grain shortage my butt , the soybean and corn have'nt even been harvested yet , you never can tell how many eggs are in the hen house until you counted them all into a basket , same thing  ...................... Right ."
732612,moxie,2012-09-25 23:59:00,1566,Big fan of Bacon as well but as far as I'm concerned its always been the dirtiest as compared to chicken and beef . As for the food shortage? Theres still plenty of wildlife to sustain us for a little while. I wonder who'll be adhering to limits once it hits the fan? hehehe.
732619,bigcreekdad,2012-09-26 00:42:00,546,I can't bring myself to read it. Life without bacon has no meaning. Leave me alone!!
732620,Rich,2012-09-26 00:47:00,3927,"The price of bacon has gone up $2 / lb.  Of course, so has the price of chicken livers.  Pigs can eat anything. That's kinda their thing.."
732622,mercman,2012-09-26 00:49:00,7054, for shame......tofu will kill you sure as shootin' at least bacon is part of the 5 basic food groups.
732658,Dave Bailey,2012-09-26 03:22:00,1641, Yeppers:  1) Alcohol 2) Caffeine 3) Sugar 4) Fat 5) Bacon
732660,Dave Bailey,2012-09-26 03:25:00,1641," I don't know which sick person invented that abomination, but it brings to mind that well-known old Hittite curse; ""May his testicles shrivel unto the size of raisins."""
732662,mirogak,2012-09-26 03:32:00,387,"If I could have trout twice a week, I would not require any other kind of meat."
732693,lakerguy,2012-09-26 11:07:00,224,What grains should we cut out of our diet so the pigs can be fed? I would like to do my part as much as i can?
