732642,hotsky,2012-09-26 02:19:00,400,"I have a Fenwick Eagle GT rod that has a broken off ring/eye. I called the store I bought it from and they said eyes aren't covered by the warranty. And they would charge $25 to replace the eye so it might be better just to buy a new one. :/  btw I found this on Fenwick website: ""Rods NOT covered under warranty may also be submitted for replacement for a nominal fee. Please contact us directly for details."" Looks like Canadian repair center is in Brantford which is only half an hour from me. Anyone dealt with them?"
732650,miller,2012-09-26 02:49:00,223,"most shops will take a $20 shipping fee and hand you a new rod over the counter if they have it in stock, if not they can usually send it out. As for a $25 charge to put an eye on thats fairly steep i believe most places offer that service for less"
732745,Garnet,2012-09-26 14:08:00,2056,$25 to replace a guide. Go some were else. Local to me $5.

732920,Nipfisher,2012-09-26 22:59:00,2449,"I have a Fenwick Canadian Methods Specialty Action Series Walleye casting rod that I purchased about 2 years ago. Last month it snapped near the top of the rod. I did not register the rod for warranty but I still have the doccumention that came with the rod. Fenwick offers ""Lifetime Accident Replacement Program"" Fenwick will replace the rod at 55% discount from current suggested retail price + $10 S&H.  I will be contacting them in Manitoba this week.    Gray_Wolf, what is the contact info for the location in Ontario?"
732933,hotsky,2012-09-26 23:52:00,400,"Fenwick Warranty Service 131 Savannah Oaks Drive, Unit#1 Brantford, Ontario N3V 1E8 (519) 750-0100  I had to replace a tip guide on other rod, Kingsway sports in Guelph did it for me for $5, but it seems easier than replacing guides below the tip. I called the number and was told I'd have to pay 50% of the price plus ~$11 shipping. I got the rod on sale for $40 but their price is $60 so it'd cost me about same as what I paid for it new and that's if I bring it in. Not sure if it's worth it..."
732934,mercman,2012-09-26 23:57:00,7054, nope.....................chuck it.
733125,bare foot wader,2012-09-27 22:58:00,1354,"I see you're in hamilton....not too far from Spiel  or you could try wrapping a guide yourself, first job won't be pretty but it'll get the job done"
733168,JCRG,2012-09-28 02:18:00,57,"I broke my eagle GT this year also, still have to call them but if they ask for 50% + shipping, I'm not gonna get it replaced. If this is the case you can have my broken rod and take the guides you need, let me know if you want it."
