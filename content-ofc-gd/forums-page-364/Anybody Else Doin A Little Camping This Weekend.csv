This time of the year is the best time to be in central Ontario backcountry, weather is looking good with light winds (perfect for jigging lakers) Is anyone else here heading out and doin a little camping/trout fishing ? Hopefully I will have a good report to share with you when I get back"

732956,Toad Hunter,2012-09-27 00:57:00,261,"one last weekend at the trailer for me*before* a sad end to the season, thanx giving was always a sad weekend for me growing up and saying good bye to my friends at the Northern eagle trailer park for another long winter. But with my first born due Jan 1st, something tells me this winter will go by faster than I would even like to fathem. And Haliburton tends to get a little chilly for an infant lol."
732994,Live2fish85,2012-09-27 02:53:00,1633,My buddy and I are doing a trip to St. Clair this weekend.  I picked up a New combo for the trip as well. A St. Croix Premier and paired it with the Revo Toro Winch. Can't wait to use it.
733005,Musky or Specks,2012-09-27 04:09:00,2710,We'll be the two drunk lout with the Burgundy Yukon
733007,Dabluz,2012-09-27 04:43:00,701,I've been thinking about doing a bit of wilderness camping (tent) this coming weekend.  I live close to the 50th parallel and it's getting quite cool....especially at night.  Only fishing for pike is allowed in my region right now....outside of fishing in the Saguenay River which is a different fishing zone but too close to home for a camping expedition.  I guess I could go to Chibougamau and do some walleye fishing/camping but that would be hard on my budget.  I hate this time of year.
733403,wormdunker,2012-09-29 10:58:00,1711,"Heading to the Gogama area Sunday morning to hook some eyes.  Fall is a beautiful time of the year up there.  The fall colors are splendid, fishing is awesome.  Taking the tent heater!"
