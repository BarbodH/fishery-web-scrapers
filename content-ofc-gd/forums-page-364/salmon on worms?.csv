733013,Rich,2012-09-27 10:22:00,3927,"Was out last night at what is usually an early rainbow run, dragging live worms. Hooked & lost a 4-5lb brown, then me & my buddy hooked 4 chinooks in a row in the mouth, with worms on the bottom! Is this normal? I have never seen chinooks take a live worm, spare the ones being flossed."
733030,azebra,2012-09-27 12:44:00,168,Surprisingly fish do eat worms
733032,GBW,2012-09-27 12:49:00,8460,seen it too.
733035,Ralph Field,2012-09-27 13:08:00,1018,"They will hit dew worms, but I've never hooked one on a pink worm yet."
733047,northernpike56,2012-09-27 14:57:00,717," I caught a huge salmon on a worm, I posted a blurred out pic on another guys thread, I was fishing with a worm in a fairly deep pool for the creek, but I dident even know until I started reeling in my line, and it was on. not flossed- the hook was basically at the back of his mouth"
733049,Joeytier,2012-09-27 15:04:00,3990,I used to love drifing big pink and red worms for chinnies...the big males smash em!
733050,ttahhan,2012-09-27 15:05:00,191,Ive had a few Chinooks and Browns eat dew worms (earthworm the fat ones)...
733055,Rich,2012-09-27 15:25:00,3927," Thanks, that's incredibly condescending."
733063,BillM,2012-09-27 15:37:00,17367,I like catching them on marshmellows.
733088,azebra,2012-09-27 19:01:00,168,"And I apologize for sounding condescending, I was just being a little sarcastic  all in good humour"
733136,Rich,2012-09-28 00:20:00,3927,"Another day, another worm fed salmon. Was gonna try a simple net across the river approach, but settled on the earplugs as the worm fishing slowed down."
733211,batoathome,2012-09-28 13:06:00,47,While fishing the maintland for bows a few years back. To my surprise a big chinny inhaled my dew worm.  I guess sometimes they hit ????????
733213,BillM,2012-09-28 13:18:00,17367," They aren't different then any other fish.. How many times have guys hooked into big muskie while fishing for panfish with their kids?  Fish are opportunistic, if it's there, they'll eat it (For the most part)"
733225,Rich,2012-09-28 14:07:00,3927,"The only reason the salmon on worms was a surprise to me is because I've never had one take a worm personally, and I grew up salmon fishing in the hammer. Turns out, after the last few days I've learned, worms are truly the worlds universal bait!"
