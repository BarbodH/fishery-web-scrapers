732381,speedtroll,2012-09-25 02:37:00,52,Hello All  Just wanted to share a good news story. I had my Calcutta 700 gears give out at Lakair this summer. Seeing as I bought it used and it is a few years old I figured I would be spending some coin on a new reel. A friend suggested i send it to Shimano and see what they say. I did and I got an email a couple days later saying that they replaced all the gears and upgraded the drag system for good measure. They did all that for $28 including shipping. I could not believe it. A brand new reel. Very sweet. Now i really know why all my reels are Shimano.
732476,SmokestackLightnin,2012-09-25 15:05:00,390,Could you please provide details as to where you shipped it.  I have a couple of Chronarchs making noise.
732478,GBW,2012-09-25 15:13:00,8460,"I would guess he shipped it here: Shimano Canada, LTD 427 Pido Road Peterborough, ON. K9J 6X7 Shimano Canada, LTD. (877) 377-5211"
732482,lew,2012-09-25 15:34:00,12766,"Not surprised to hear they looked after you so well Rob, Shimano is a great company to deal with."
732483,misfish,2012-09-25 15:35:00,29133,Good to hear Rob.
732487,fishindevil,2012-09-25 15:44:00,6254,"they are a great bunch to deal with,and i have sent a few rods & reels back to them and always either got upgraded or fixed,for little more than shipping costs !!! same reason i have been shimano all my life as well...chee  rs to them"
732610,msp,2012-09-25 23:52:00,1336,"yep, great company to deal with. good customer service goes a very long way. I have broken almost two rods every summer for the last 4 years. Mostly my fault, car doors, live wells, stepped on. All rods had been replaced for the low cost of shipping. All rods from now on will be Shimano or Loomis"
732638,MCTFisher9120,2012-09-26 02:14:00,3761,Shimano reels and a mix of G.Loomis/Shimano rods here. Love there warranty and what the company provides to the fishing industry.  Glad they fixed up your Calcutta.
732643,Steve,2012-09-26 02:20:00,2075,"just hope if you break a rod/reel, they have one in stock - somewhere in north america.  or you will be waiting  ......  for a long time.  currently awaiting replacement of another NRX (893) due to glue failure as well as a replacement of a crucial crankbait rod. all were sent in first week of July.  That would be about 3 months waiting now.  Shimano is not known for keeping much stock on hand."
732673,Bondar,2012-09-26 04:23:00,817,"I had a warranty issue with a Loomis , and they sent Canpar right to my house and Delivered a new rod back in 2 weeks , with zero charge to me ! Can't beat that."
732837,esoxansteel,2012-09-26 19:01:00,1307,"I took out what im assuming is the pawl gear trolling the Larry on my Tecota 600LC, and maybe a few other issues, took it down to be looked at and fixed, and im sure it will come back like new, the product is only as good as the service, and the service is 2nd to none, and it helps that the service and warranty dept are in town."
732910,BucktownAngler,2012-09-26 22:31:00,582,"almost makes me want to get a Shimano reel  i've just never had any problems with my Quantum reels, so no need i guess.  Although i've had my eye on that new Calcutta D"
733291,esoxansteel,2012-09-28 20:05:00,1307,"  Just picked up my Tecota 600 LC,	33.90 was the total bill including taxes, for replacing the pawl gear, drag washers, and a good cleaning, you cant go wrong with that, service beyond the sale.  thanx  shimano"
733295,bare foot wader,2012-09-28 20:28:00,1354,"they're good people in peterborough...they mailed me a rebate cheque but it wasn't signed and bank wouldn't cash it  they re-issued the cheque and sent me a hat and t shirt, pretty nice"
