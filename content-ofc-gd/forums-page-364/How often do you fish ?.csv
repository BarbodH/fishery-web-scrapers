732345,ttahhan,2012-09-25 01:29:00,191,How often do you all fish.......
732346,solopaddler,2012-09-25 01:30:00,8605, Not nearly as many times as you create polls.   
732347,Joeytier,2012-09-25 01:33:00,3990,I would guess a little over 50.
732374,mike rousseau,2012-09-25 02:21:00,4661,Last year about 100 trips out...  Probably around 50-75 so far and 30-40 to go....
732375,ProFishermanJones,2012-09-25 02:24:00,77,Every Damn Day. HARD minimum of 5 hours usually upwards of 8+
732377,manitoubass2,2012-09-25 02:27:00,11391,   I could never keep track. it's almost daily for me throughout the year. Sometimes it's 12 hours a day sometimes its an hour   
732378,BillM,2012-09-25 02:29:00,17367, LOL!
732386,Moosebunk,2012-09-25 02:46:00,3970,  Thanks Mikey!!!   Fish more than should admit.  I'll average two days a week by years end... but sometimes it comes in lump sums.  Like May... when it was 18 days without a trip or time off work.   And then there were the trips.  Could be smokin' crack though...
732425,Rich Clemens,2012-09-25 10:41:00,3131,"Other than a couple day trips back here at home, the bulk of my fishing is my thrwee weeks in Ontario each year."
732433,Christopheraaron,2012-09-25 11:38:00,3525,"I'm with you PFJ, I'm in hospital an plan on doing a little fishing later today! LOL. I've been out about 200 times this year and there's still a good bit of time until jan 1."
732438,ttahhan,2012-09-25 12:10:00,191,
732439,Fish Farmer,2012-09-25 12:14:00,2234,"Used to fish almost every day, not anymore. Would fish more if gas and ramp fees weren't so much. When your retired, you got to have your priorities. Age has a little bit to do with it. Doing a lot of volunteering fishing related stuff is just enjoyable and it keeps me busy."
732446,Garry2Rs,2012-09-25 12:51:00,1425,"Some folks, like myself, live in fishing country.  We have an advantage in that we can practically drop a line on the way home from the grocery store.  Additionally, by going south I gain several months of open water and open season that my frozen friends in Ontario won't have.  However even with all that, I would find it impossible to fish 250 days a year...To accomplish that, a guy would have to fish 4.8 days a week, in all 12 months!  That sure wouldn't leave much time for Xmas, New Years, illness, birthday parties, Grey Cup, Superbowl, Stanley Cup, hang overs, car repairs, shopping, laundry, keeping the peace with your girl friends or a job."
732453,Live2fish85,2012-09-25 13:09:00,1633,"I get out easily over 50 times I fish at least two times a week often more. That being said as others have mentioned, there are times where I don't fish for over a week but then I make up for it other times. I usually get up well before the wife and kids and then come back around noon and hang out with them."
732468,torco,2012-09-25 14:17:00,656,Not nearly as much now that I have 2 young kids and a part time job on top of the full time job. My goal is to fish once a week but there have been times this year where its once a month.
732513,Rich,2012-09-25 17:41:00,3927,Everyday.. I can't handle not fishing!
732520,fishinmortician,2012-09-25 18:09:00,100,"With a 2 year old and a 4 month old, I'm pretty much pooched! I get the odd cast from the couch with a toy rod landing the odd jelly fish and big shark!"
732523,Garnet,2012-09-25 18:16:00,2056,My guess would be 175 - 225 every year for 35 years. I do fish for every species except musky.
732755,asdve23rveavwa,2012-09-26 14:55:00,2690,"WAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAY too few, especially lately!!!"
