Just to confirm though I am NOT looking for locations, I have those, just need to know the truckability of the roads/trails I am looking to travel. Scratches are irrelevant and expected, chainsaws are on top. We do not bring bikes and walk from our camp location to hunt so knowing (hoping) we can get in is paramount."
733156,pics,2012-09-28 01:45:00,1268,I guess it depends on how many people have accessed the are through the summer which would tend to open the trail somewhat. The lodge owners up there are famous for sending in fishermen if there's a mere mention of a few being caught... If you are on foot the trails a truck can't get down would be the first ones I would try but then again the bow hunters as well as bird and bear guys have been down anything passable...either way you will have some interesting driving......
