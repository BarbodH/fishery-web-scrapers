731898,lew,2012-09-23 12:46:00,12766,Does a double rainbow have 2 pots of gold ??
731903,Skipper D,2012-09-23 13:12:00,1970,"Awsome morning picture Lew and thank you for sharing it , we could see the dark clouds over your way this morning and Bev mention some body was going to get a rainbow . Knowing how you like your photos o'l natural heres a few my wife would like to share with you , they might be the only gold your gona receive from your morning rainbows .... lol ,  there were six of them flying around but no matter how hard she tryed last night there was no way she could get them all in one picture at the same time .You'll have to click on them to see them bigger ."

731906,lew,2012-09-23 13:24:00,12766,"Thanks Skip, it's always nice when the critters stop by for a visit"
732011,misfish,2012-09-23 21:43:00,29133,"Great shot Lew.  Looks like it made it our way this evening.  Just snapped this shot. Guess it,s going to be a great night as well.  You can barely make out the double.  "
732015,Christopheraaron,2012-09-23 21:49:00,3525,Awesome B!
732029,lew,2012-09-23 22:52:00,12766,Nice one Brian !!  Seems like a few of us saw some of natures finest work to-day !!
732032,Christopheraaron,2012-09-23 23:11:00,3525,you mean like I did today?   
732033,Musky or Specks,2012-09-23 23:30:00,2710,"Chris lad, Your young enough to do all the heavy lifting on a portage"
732034,Christopheraaron,2012-09-23 23:32:00,3525," ?, also not even close, unless the definition has changed. LOL!"
732068,Musky or Specks,2012-09-24 01:52:00,2710,You asked for places to go with short portages for trout. Child labour is a great thing when it comes to portaging
732069,Christopheraaron,2012-09-24 02:04:00,3525, You can't see the size of my arms in that shot! LOL!
732076,Musky or Specks,2012-09-24 03:02:00,2710,"Hey 10 trips, one trip the sooner YOU get it done the sooner your Dad/Partner can fish"
