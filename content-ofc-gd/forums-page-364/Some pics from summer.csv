732674,bobowski,2012-09-26 04:27:00,360,I didn't manage to get out fishing as much as I may have liked this summer but I still got out quite a bit. Most of these fish were taken from the southern georgian bay area and some of the smallies are from a local river. All in all it was a good summer and now im looking forward to landing some big fall muskie out on the bay. My pb muskie to date is 35 inches but I plan on eclipsing that this fall starting this weekend. Anyhow here are some of the pics from the summer when I remembered to take my Camera/phone out with me. I fish alone most of the time so most of them are self shots.
