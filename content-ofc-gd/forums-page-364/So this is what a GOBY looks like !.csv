I started in Hastings at The lock caught a couple of walleyes (released) when daybreak hit i decided to head home and stop by Scott's Mill Dam, This is where i caught my first Goby ! When i lifted my rod i was surprised as i was like what the is this.. After closer encounters with it i realized this is a Goby, With my polarized glasses on i hook up a earthworm and dropped it back in.. Now this is the crazy thing i saw as i tossed the line back in, I noticed a bunch of fish that were really hard to see, they within 3 seconds..decimated my worm it had nicks all over.... I caught no walleye there and would like to report and say holy cow the water level is very very low and clear, as i was heading back to my vehicle i took a quick look in the channel and wow i probably seen about 6 big smallies just cruising just outside of the weeds...i did not attempt to fish them i was tired from my journey and started to head home....Father duties call......All in all it was nice to get out a dip the line... Here are some pics....        "

733028,GBW,2012-09-27 12:37:00,8460,I hope you killed it (the goby) and left it on land.  oh and VERY nice walleye.
733038,fishindevil,2012-09-27 13:36:00,6254,why did you put the goby back in ??? you are supposed to kill it and feed the seagulls...?????
733045,ttahhan,2012-09-27 14:53:00,191,The Goby was decimated on land by about 200 Ft Lbs Of Force ... was not released !
733046,northernpike56,2012-09-27 14:54:00,717, lol!
733054,mercman,2012-09-27 15:19:00,7054,  I put them in an empty Tims cup. Its always funny when i bring it back and ask them for a replacement coffee.
733069,Christopheraaron,2012-09-27 16:33:00,3525," That's a nice idea, I really hate walking out on a pier and finding it littered with dried up gobies."
733070,fishindevil,2012-09-27 16:35:00,6254,200ft pounds of brute force is cool !!!!
733226,Rich,2012-09-28 14:15:00,3927,"Hey guys those gobies are great fertilizer, as they decompose they do not stink all that much and feed plants like miracle grow!"
733230,ttahhan,2012-09-28 14:20:00,191, Really ???
733231,Rich,2012-09-28 14:22:00,3927,"Yeah, for real.. unfortunately a couple dozen will feed your plants for a season so its not really a viable way to wipe gobies out.. but at least they're useful for something!"
733429,GBW,2012-09-29 15:10:00,8460,waiting for HH to chime in here about the great rose bush fertilizer
