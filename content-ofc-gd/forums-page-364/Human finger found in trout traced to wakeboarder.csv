Fisherman Nolan Calvin found the finger while he was cleaning the trout in early September. He put it on ice and called the sheriff's office. The Spokesman-Review newspaper reports that detectives were able to get a fingerprint off the severed digit. They matched it to a fingerprint card for a 31-year-old man. Investigators learned that the man, Hans A. Galassi, lost four fingers from his left hand in a July 4 accident on the same lake where the fish was caught. The three other fingers have not been recovered."
