732973,Toad Hunter,2012-09-27 01:50:00,261,"well, last friday the mrs and I headed up to the trailer for one of the last weekends of the season. We got up there a little late and were anxious to join friends around the fire. And I guess I goofed and didn't slope my, already slightly streched, awning when I was setting it up after the long drive. (didn't even consider the rain the ""experts"" were predictin)  And well, when I stepped out for my smoke and coffee in the morning, I had to walk through this...    but on the plus side, the same rain made my grass seed, that I layed over Lab. long weekend and have not been able to tend to since, look amazing ...    I tell myself that I'm lucky that it happened at the end rather than beginning of the season. But I'd hate to be in a financial situation with a little on expected over the off season to have to pole and tarp my little piece of heaven.. So curious if anyone on here has or knows of anyone that has a fair priced used replacement that I may be able to purchase ?? or anyone with thoughts as to where I would be able to pick one up ?"
732976,Toad Hunter,2012-09-27 01:59:00,261,I'll also point out that I am not stuck on an exact color replacement or anything and will obviosly need a new roller as well. (I'm heading back up this weekend and have a closer look as to what hardware will be salvageable and what not.
732977,Nipfisher,2012-09-27 02:00:00,2449,New awnings aren't cheap. Minimum $1800. Looks like a 20'er (awning). Replacement costs for used ones are $300 and up on kijiji.
