Does anyone have any first hand experience with these? I presently use an x-67c and do love it....but I've had it for 4 yrs or so. You know, boys and their toys. lol"

733179,ckrb2007,2012-09-28 03:20:00,449," Will do, Jesse."
733223,adempsey,2012-09-28 14:06:00,1498,I think the bigger question will be if you can even find one to buy!  Nice unit though.
