732330,Duckie,2012-09-25 00:48:00,305,"thanks for all the kind words.  I actually think I may have beaten that Personal Best with a new Personal best last night:  this fish was weighed by friendly fellow fishermen on the pier at 24 pounds. it was super thick and fat.  probably weighed more than the silver fish, I would think??. It felt heavier to me.  one thing is for sure: I am sure giving my Loomis SJR843 GL3 spinning rod a work out this salmon season lol. just yesterday it begged me to use it for bass again hahaha  but look at the colour: dark/golden. Has this fish been up the river and back out?  I'm confused as to the colour change too.  I was always told they darken when they have been up river. the ones out in the lake are more silver?? "
732394,LimbLifter,2012-09-25 03:06:00,27,"  That fish hasn't run the river, but the next good rain will probably push it up. The only way they come back down river is floating upside down.  It all depends when the fish will push up river. In early August, if you get a good cold rain, you can see good numbers of silver fish push up river with very few anglers around.  In most cases, the fish will start turning colour as early as mid to late July out in the lake. Its not uncommon to catch a darkening fish in July downrigging in 100 to 150 ft of water.  Most fish are aready a nice bronze color once they make it to the piers - although, as I mentioned in a prior post, there's always exceptions to the rule with fish that mature later.  Nice fish for sure."
732410,Cudz,2012-09-25 04:26:00,2652,Here are a couple of pics from about 23 years ago. the first pic is of me and a hen taken from the Notty in Angus.  Well into the river. The second pic is of my father and a big Lake Otario fish taken about a mile out in Port Credit. My fish is a Georgian Bay female in the river and my dad's is a Lake O male taken in the lake.  So it goes to show that it really depends on several factors as to the how silver the fish may be.  
732493,ch312,2012-09-25 16:29:00,1590,"  no wonder there's so much arguing on here daily, some of us can't even agree with ourselves  :"
732801,FishTracker,2012-09-26 17:04:00,47,Congrats on the PB and even newer PB!  I think I saw you (and a pic of the fish directly on your camera) the night you got the first PB! I bet it gave your gear (including your arms) a great workout!
732822,BillM,2012-09-26 17:42:00,17367, Here's some reading for you.  http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/take_out_of_context
732875,jimmer,2012-09-26 20:25:00,2730,"Nice chinooks! Your going to break your personal best again this year if you keep it up. Regarding the fish changing. They definitely start changing in early August. I used to do a great deal of taxidermy work and the difference between a July fish and an August fish was like night and day. Scales all fall off in July (best to do a repro), but you could be careful cleaning an August fish and keep the scales on the fish. They are still chrome looking, but you start seeing more black in their scale pattern. I have also caught some fairly dark looking fish off of piers and some shiney ones in the river. They are not the same chrome as out of the lake though."
732990,northernpike56,2012-09-27 02:35:00,717,"nice fish. I just caught my PB out of a creek a few days ago, it ate a worm, no joke, inhaled it. It was about 28-30 lbs."
732991,Duckie,2012-09-27 02:41:00,305,"  small world!  thanks, I got another one the other day, but it was a bit smaller than the other two, but still a great fish.  the fight these fish put up is addictive LOL "
732992,Duckie,2012-09-27 02:42:00,305,  nice! did you get any pics? would love to see a shot of this monster!
733002,northernpike56,2012-09-27 03:53:00,717,"  well, now that I compare pics maaaaaaybe not quite 30 lbs, but the biggest fish I've ever caught nonetheless. Keep in mind I am almost 6 ft and 149 lbs."
733014,Duckie,2012-09-27 10:29:00,305,still a thick fish! congrats!  
733015,Rich,2012-09-27 10:33:00,3927,"Nice fish!  Not all salmon do the same thing at the same time. I got one on a swimbait at the end of november last year, when they should have all been dead. Ya never know."
733266,FishTracker,2012-09-28 17:02:00,47," Indeed it is!  Again, great fish.  I'll likely see you again soon!"
733408,azebra,2012-09-29 11:51:00,168,28-30 lbs is huge but not uncommon. The largest weight this year for me is 15lb 9-10oz on my digi scale.  If I didn't have the scale I would have been saying it was 20-25lbs. Don't assume large fish weight the beasts Nice fish btw you look happy:)  but it looks like my 15 pounder I'd post the pic but I'm on an iPad and don't know how to reduce the size...
733410,Duckie,2012-09-29 12:34:00,305,"true, it is very easy to over estimate the weights on these fish.  the fish I posted earlier with the huge girth was weighed at 24 pounds.  I could hardly pick it up. its a benchmark for me now.  if I don't have trouble picking up the fish without a fair bit of effort, its nowhere near 24 pounds.  I would have thought it was more but you don't know until you actually weigh it.  I have seen people land huge salmon and say its gotta be 30 pounds.  then they pull out the scale and its 18..  easy to do, but it doesn't really matter in the end.  who cares if the fish is 20 or 25 or 15?  they are all amazing fish and they all fight hard!  congrats to all those anglers lucky enough to land one.  its easier said then done sometimes. there are a lot of people out on the piers that have never caught one yet."
733419,Moosebunk,2012-09-29 14:05:00,3970,Fresh and healthy looking salmon.  Nice catch!
733421,Toronto_Angler,2012-09-29 14:25:00,698,"  6ft 149? We gotta get some more shor lunches in ya! lol! jk, nice fish"
733423,Christopheraaron,2012-09-29 14:30:00,3525, HaHa! I'm the same height but 105lbs!
733425,DundasSteelheader,2012-09-29 14:31:00,166,"Very nice fish everyone!  Salmon are a blast this time of year.   Any idea of the weight of this one gentlemen? Didn't have a scale or tapemeasure but I marked off the length on the rod I had, it was 43in long, and that boot is about 5 inches wide. This is a picture of my friend with the fish, all the ones with me are terrible     "
733428,azebra,2012-09-29 15:09:00,168,6'0 180 185   This sounds like a dating profile type of site lol
733456,BillM,2012-09-29 18:22:00,17367,25-28lbs would be my guess.  Big boot for sure!
733543,Duckie,2012-09-30 10:53:00,305,"very nice fish. if you compare to the legit 24 pounder I posted earlier, the fish looks to be a good 18-20 pounds I would say. great fish! congrats!"
731871,Duckie,2012-09-23 04:13:00,305,"Just wanted to share a pic of my largest salmon ever, caught last week from a local pier.  fought like a beast, released to be caught again (or to go up river and spawn lol)  fish was taken on, surprise surpise, a spoon! "
731879,davey buoy,2012-09-23 10:35:00,5505,Nice fish!!They sure fight hard.

731917,LimbLifter,2012-09-23 14:11:00,27,Surprisingly silver for this time of year.  Nice going.
731954,azebra,2012-09-23 17:13:00,168,"Posted Today, 10:11 AM Surprisingly silver for this time of year. Nice going.  The fish is so silver because the gentleman who caught it said he caught it off a pier in a lake.  Salmon can remain silver up to 3 days upon entering the river system and usually won't change Colours or physical appearance (ie. Kype jaw) until 12-24hrs in the river systems from my observations.  Last night on a local Lake Ontario trib 30 or so minutes after sunset a big chrome slab decided to linger in a foot of water inches from my toes.  He was so silver I could see my reflection lol.  This was all within a quarter kilometre of the rivers mouth."
731966,Joey,2012-09-23 18:14:00,9122,"Wow, nice chrome on that one    Congrats on the PB!"
731968,BillM,2012-09-23 18:16:00,17367, Salmon start getting dark way before they enter the rivers...
731973,Snidley,2012-09-23 18:27:00,620,"That information about our Chinnook salmon is basically wrong. Our Chinnooks are a strain the darkens in the lake. They are virtually all coloured prior to entering the river and for some time before entering (ie up to a month) On the rare occasion that a silver 4 year old fish is caught on shore they can change in colour within an hour. I have seen this happen on my own stringer at Thornbury with a still live fish. It would be an interesting experiment to try other strain of Chinnook, like Idaho strains, that stay silver for months after entering the river (somthing about much higher fat content that fuel the long thousand mile migration from the Pacific to Idaho). Imagine full power silver Chinnooks up the river to test shore anglers skills. Even I might break out the pin.  There was some talk about bigger strains of Rainbows going into the Saugeen watershed as well. Don't know where that's at but it would be another great idea since the Chinnooks don't seem to be doing all that well in Lake Huron while Rainbows are thriving. These would be good experiments because the animals in question, Chinnooks and Rainbows, have proven themselves as successful transplants  unlike Atlantics were a fortune was wasted on a fish species every expert knew would fail as a thriving stocker."
731978,blaque,2012-09-23 18:49:00,2419,I've heard they only enter the rivers on Tuesdays and Thursdays.
731979,12footspringbok,2012-09-23 18:50:00,459,Its really hard to tell from that picture but judging by the way the spots on the upper tail radiate out in rows on that fish makes me say steelhead.  In my experience the salmon will stay a beautiful chrome colour for days or weeks in the river if the water is cold enough. This morning I almost mistook a beauty silver salmon for a big steelhead.  Heres a beauty late silver salmon from a few years ago.   Nice catch either way thanks for sharing.
731980,BillM,2012-09-23 18:54:00,17367,Steelhead?  Looks like a big fat chinook hen to me..
731981,davey buoy,2012-09-23 18:58:00,5505,"I have also seen many silver salmon caught recently. Even if it took them a day or week to get where I was,they were still a nice clean color. How does that work then?."
731983,misfish,2012-09-23 19:08:00,29133,"Lots of silver chinny caught in the river here. As for being a steel head,,,,,,,,,,,, Nope."
731999,Spiel,2012-09-23 20:59:00,9065,"It's hard to read through all the misinformation here I don't even know what to say other than, nice big Chinook to the OP, well done."
732100,azebra,2012-09-24 05:53:00,168,I'm not doubting you because of your status in life and on the boards... But if I only had a picture... There was a silver slab of fish at my feet last night and this wasnt the first time.  i have been targeting steelhead and salmon for 9 years and have seen this silver many times upstream from the river mouth.  I don't do drugs so I wasn't hallucinating  please explained that sliver shiny fish 1/4 km up stream from the river??
732103,Snidley,2012-09-24 08:32:00,620,"Could be a fish that has not changed yet plain and simple. Most likely it is a 3 year fish that either was blown inshore, was chasing bait or got caught up with the push of fish coming into spawn. I caught a silver Chinook myself last week. It was about 15lb. and was among several others that were dark that night.You notice them because they are different than the majority of the fish being caught. With that being said anyone with experience knows that our 4 year Chinooks start to change in the lake, some as early as late July, and by this time of year they are virtually all changed over be they in the river or lurking around river mouths in the lake. You should be happy that there is the occasional chromer to catch but it is not in any way what the average spawner looks like at this time of year."
732109,Live2fish85,2012-09-24 11:52:00,1633,I have been out a few times casting for salmon and they do indeed change colours before entering the mouths. Some males also have a kype before they enter as well. I have seen more dirty looking chinooks of the pier then I have silver.  We also had some that were really dark while trolling a few weeks back a good distance from any river mouths.  I think it really just depends on the fish.
732123,azebra,2012-09-24 13:04:00,168,"Interesting, thanks for that info! If only we could have conversations with fish"
732129,BillM,2012-09-24 13:30:00,17367," I guess fish change when they want to, lol!   I've found chromers way up stream as well, and also black boots out in the river mouths before they even enter the river.  I guess that's one of the joys of salmon/steelhead fishing, you never know what's on the end of the line"
732137,mirogak,2012-09-24 14:33:00,387,Nice Salmon - congrats on the PB
732229,LimbLifter,2012-09-24 20:56:00,27,"  I think Bill M was talking generally. It's fairly rare to see such a silver fish such as the one in the picture, even at the pier.  Maybe one in 10 fish have a silvery appearance and probably 99.9 percent of these silver fish will be females. These fish, for whatever reason, don't seem to get as dark. I've caught fairly silver fish in the river (when I used to fish the rivers), that were very ripe and spitting eggs.  In the northern tribs (Bighead, Owen Sound etc.), they used to have the odd spring run chinook come through in April/May.  These were pure chrome fish and would be fully ripe.  If anybody has info on this strain, I would be very interested in hearing about it.  I have only seen three caught in 25 years of fishing the rivers.  Another interesting note - the eggs of these fish were very fragile, would break extremely easy, and couldn't be water cured like a typical chinny egg."
732234,misfish,2012-09-24 21:42:00,29133, We stayed at a camp ground in Owen sound many years ago in July for a laccross tourney (gap the name of it) but it had silver chinnys in it. One kid even tailed one with his hands.
732251,Dutch,2012-09-24 22:42:00,831,Back on topic - nice fish OP.
