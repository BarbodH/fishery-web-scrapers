732306,ttahhan,2012-09-25 00:14:00,191,What do you think ?
732308,Joeytier,2012-09-25 00:16:00,3990,No...no.  Skeet casting as part of a decathalon...definitely.
732318,Rod Caster,2012-09-25 00:30:00,5784,"Absolutely not hahaha. If so, I want beer drinking included as well."
732324,mercman,2012-09-25 00:40:00,7054,Bass Vaulting....Now theres a manly sport !!!
732326,Muskieman,2012-09-25 00:43:00,2472,"Yep !  never been into Bass...I never really target them, 90% of my catches are accidental..they're fun to catch. sorry."
732327,Muskieman,2012-09-25 00:46:00,2472,"here's something , include "" angling "" open species , mix it with Shot Put and see who can chuck'em the farthest ?"
732329,BillM,2012-09-25 00:46:00,17367,Fishing shouldn't be apart of the Olympics.
732334,Muskieman,2012-09-25 00:55:00,2472,"fishing belongs in the Olympics as much as wood splitting or underwater basket weaving.... If it would be an Olympic sport , it would probably end up like a Fish-O-Mania thing...I don't think that the IOC would let 300HP outboards compete.  M/O  Randy "
732351,i2cool2fool,2012-09-25 01:42:00,349,Well... I had lots of that kind of training growing up.
732376,ckrb2007,2012-09-25 02:25:00,449,Well we are finely tuned athletes......aren't we?!?!
732379,manitoubass2,2012-09-25 02:32:00,11391," Hell yes we are!  I think about it everytime I wake up with a hangover and a full belly. My training the next day consists of cleaning the house and planning my next outing. Nothing but, world class...   "
732392,Moosebunk,2012-09-25 02:58:00,3970,Maybe they could somehow swing it that the javelin or archery gets incorporated into fishing for carp.  Just to make it interesting!?!
732436,OhioFisherman,2012-09-25 12:06:00,6623,Only if they limit it to hot chicks in string bikinis.
732441,Garry2Rs,2012-09-25 12:22:00,1425,"In my opinion there are already too many diversions and games being called ""sports"" in the Olympics.  We already have artistic ribbon twirling, what's next Olympic Texas Hold'em?"
732445,ttahhan,2012-09-25 12:45:00,191,  This i fear.....its getting very popular with the tv stations
732893,Garry2Rs,2012-09-26 21:32:00,1425," Can't you just picture Doyle ""Texas Dolly"" Brunson up on the podium, leaning on his cane, taking a medal? Gray Power!"
