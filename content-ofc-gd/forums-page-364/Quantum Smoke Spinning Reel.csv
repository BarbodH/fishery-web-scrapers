732851,LucG,2012-09-26 19:36:00,779,Does anyone know how to oil and grease the gears on a Quantum Smoke Spinning reel?  It spent 3 days in the rain and it seems to be sticking.  I've searched google and youtube with no luck on this specific reel.  Thanks
732855,LucG,2012-09-26 19:41:00,779, The only thing it came with was the schematics.
732858,BillM,2012-09-26 19:43:00,17367, That's what you want when you take it apart and grease/oil it.
732860,LucG,2012-09-26 19:45:00,779, I was trying to avoid a complete dismantle. Several of my other reels have a single screw I can remove and add oil/grease through there...
732861,LucG,2012-09-26 19:45:00,779," Thanks, I'll remember that!"
732864,LucG,2012-09-26 19:51:00,779, Yeah eh? I guess Iâ€™ll be getting intimate with the reel instead of the girlfriend tonight lol  Are there any materials that I shouldnt use when trying to clean her up? Such as Q-Tips?
732874,BillM,2012-09-26 20:24:00,17367,"No WD-40 or anything that will break down the grease.  Q-Tips are fine.   Also don't over do it, a few drops is usually all that's needed."
732886,Snowball,2012-09-26 20:44:00,167,"There is a video on YouTube that may help you:    Regards, Snowball"
733020,LucG,2012-09-27 12:15:00,779," Thanks, good advice.   Thanks Snowball, I had allready come upon this video, I did those basic mantenance tips and it seemed to have made a difference. But the real test will be when I put it through 8 hours of fishing lol"
