733074,jimmer,2012-09-27 17:15:00,2730,I mentioned in another post that our group is looking for a new ice fishing location other than Nipissing. Just wondering if anyone has done an ice fishing trip to the west side of Quebec in the winter? Any recommendations? What was the fishing like? We tend to like the cottage setup with a hut included for day use. Any ideas would be appreciated. Thanks
733086,bobowski,2012-09-27 17:49:00,360,You sound like your in a similar boat as me although I'm not looking for Quebec. I wish that I could help you but I have never fished Quebec. I'm sure somebody on here can help you out. Good luck.
733089,jimmer,2012-09-27 19:04:00,2730,"Let me know if you locate any good places in Ontario and I will do the same for you as we search through the options. We have started to discuss Quebec, because of our inability to find a place that suits are needs. Don't get me wrong, Nipissing is loaded with great places, we just haven't had much luck in the last few years. We always did well prior to that."
733090,carll2,2012-09-27 19:07:00,443,ive heard lake abitibi has some great places

733153,Joeytier,2012-09-28 01:22:00,3990,Abitibi is definitely a good choice.  Don't need to go to the Quebec side either.
