202620,Mike01,2008-05-16 13:12:00,378,"I was talking to Sam yesterday...he's definetly not dead. I think I will give im a try, seems like he knows what he is talking about."
732582,Rod Caster,2012-09-25 22:27:00,5784,I just picked up my Soron STX20 from Sam`s (broken bail and needed a lube job). $24.00 all in! It would have cost me $20.00 just to ship it out to an Abu dealer for `assessment`.  he`ll be getting more business from me! Great person to deal with!   
732593,e-z-out,2012-09-25 23:00:00,1052,Sam is a great guy to deal with and his prices can't be beat.
732850,LucG,2012-09-26 19:33:00,779," Definitly not dead! lol Just got back from his place. He does a great job on my reels, and I get him to replace at least 5-6 broken guides per year lol   Just realized this post was started in May 2008  Nice bump Chad lol"
