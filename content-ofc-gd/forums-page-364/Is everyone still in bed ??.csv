Maybe tomorrow?  Michael"
732692,Roy,2012-09-26 11:00:00,13728," The reason for that is that the board is divided into several sub-forums such as General Discussion, Classifieds, Tournament etc. If you scroll down to the bottom of the page to any of the sub-forums, you'll see who is logged in to that particular sub-forum. If you want to see who all is loogged into the board, you must go the the main page. For example: at 6:48 this morning on the General discussion page there were 18 members and 31 guests...49 total. At the very same time on the main page there were 31 members and 131 guests for a total of 162."
