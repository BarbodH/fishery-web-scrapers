732172,azebra,2012-09-24 17:24:00,168,"Hey all, I hooked into this one up on manitoulin island last week. Is it a coho? Whiteish mouth. And don't laugh at my retarded facial expressions "
732174,BillM,2012-09-24 17:26:00,17367,Chinook.
732175,jimmer,2012-09-24 17:29:00,2730,chinook
732176,azebra,2012-09-24 17:30:00,168,Humm I would have put money that it was a coho. With the predominately white mouth and the smaller size of the fish in this system compared to lake O chinook
732180,Christopheraaron,2012-09-24 17:33:00,3525,Chinny.
732182,mirogak,2012-09-24 17:38:00,387, Don't do alot of run fishing but I'll go with Bill on this one.
732183,ttahhan,2012-09-24 17:39:00,191,Male Chinook Salmon
732184,BillM,2012-09-24 17:39:00,17367," Lake Huron/Superior chinooks don't get to the proportions like their Lake O cousins do...  Also if it was a coho, the lower jaw would be a lot more pronounced, especially this time of year."
732188,fishnsled,2012-09-24 17:57:00,3520,I'll agree with Bill as well. Learned a bit more since Joey and I have been going to school.  From my post last week.  From Fisherman  This might help.  MNR fish ID  and this  Salmon Facts and ID
732189,Fisherman,2012-09-24 17:57:00,7201,"First thing, look at the tail,  Chinooks have spots all over the tail, Coho only have spots on the upper half."
732191,anders,2012-09-24 18:06:00,1168,100% Chinook
732261,Joeytier,2012-09-24 23:04:00,3990,That's a real nice looking fish for a coloured up chinook!
732265,ketchenany,2012-09-24 23:08:00,3229,  That's why Bill wears boots!
732269,aplumma,2012-09-24 23:17:00,6896,it's a henway.  Art
732271,solopaddler,2012-09-24 23:20:00,8605," Correct, or approximately 41/2lb's."
732277,MJL,2012-09-24 23:27:00,2427," For 99% of the cases this is true (upper lobe of the tail would be the more correct way of saying this). I'm not sure if other anglers who have been catching Lake O cohos the last couple of years have noticed some irregularities with regards to the spotting on a good number of coho tails. The last 2 seasons, I have been catching cohos with spots on both the upper and lower lobes of the tails as well as spotting on the upper lobe and middle of the tail. Perhaps chinook/coho hybrids?"
732278,aplumma,2012-09-24 23:28:00,6896,  I always have loved that joke.  The funny part is what would a Southern idiot like me know about Salmon.  Art
732291,solopaddler,2012-09-24 23:44:00,8605, About as much as the rest of us it would seem.
732293,ketchenany,2012-09-24 23:47:00,3229, About 41/2 lbs
732311,Joey,2012-09-25 00:19:00,9122," Don't forget your pencil case for our next class Will, you dulled all mine already, not to mention I have no erasers left from all your mistakes"
732333,Duckie,2012-09-25 00:50:00,305,what an amazing fish! love the cool hookmouth
732338,fishnsled,2012-09-25 01:10:00,3520,  
732632,LimbLifter,2012-09-26 01:47:00,27,Its a Pike...definitely a large mouth Pike.
732659,Snidley,2012-09-26 03:23:00,620,If Pink/Chinook hybrid is called a Pinook is a Coho/Chinnook hybrid a Conook or a Chinho?
732706,azebra,2012-09-26 12:11:00,168,Here I was thinking it was a saltwater pumpkinseed-catfish with all those spots..
