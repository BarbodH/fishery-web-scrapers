732140,ehg,2012-09-24 14:45:00,2666,Enjoyed reading this. As a child my father would take me fishing there. Caught my first smallmouth bass downstream and first brook trout upstream. That was 35 yrs. ago.  Sounds like the Duffin's watershed is still mostly intact. Thank goodness the airport expansion has been put on hold. That would wreck this still great place.
732148,ttahhan,2012-09-24 15:58:00,191, Totally Agree With You.....The Pickering Airport would ruin everything.....On the bright side......Its been Opposed !
732264,Joeytier,2012-09-24 23:08:00,3990,"Absolutely, and for good reason.  The Duffins and Rouge River valleys have got to be the two most important 'Green Belt' regions in southern ontario."
732667,mirogak,2012-09-26 03:40:00,387, Totally agree with you - I had read this report over and over again last winter and was glad to be so close to the area.
