733325,mistaredone,2012-09-28 22:06:00,913,Packing the boat I realize the crank is slipping on my Abu Record. Realizing I'm not getting parts at this time I'm in the market for a new reel. Called BP and found out the record is discontinued.  What would be a similar reel in price and quality and available in lefty  Thanks
733331,Live2fish85,2012-09-28 22:14:00,1633,If you can spend a bit more and you can get the Curado 301e. It is a great reel.  I just picked up a Winch. Feels like a great reel can't wait to try it.  The C4 comes in left hand as well and is lower price then the record.
733333,Christopheraaron,2012-09-28 22:22:00,3525,"I have an ambassador by abu and it's great, not the most forgiving for a beginner but for sure a high quality reel for not to bad a price."
733335,mistaredone,2012-09-28 22:24:00,913,"Arent they all ambassadors? C3,4 Record?"
733336,Live2fish85,2012-09-28 22:26:00,1633,I am not sure I believe my winch says ambassador on it as well.
733337,Garry2Rs,2012-09-28 22:33:00,1425,What do you mean the crank is slipping? Could the drag be loosened off to the point the spool is slipping? If you are going toward the Kawarthas I have a high end left handed Quantum I can lend you. PM me ... Garry2R's
733338,Roy,2012-09-28 22:34:00,13728,"What do you mean ""the crank is slipping"" ? What's it doing exactly and how much use has the reel had?"
733339,Roy,2012-09-28 22:35:00,13728,hahaha 2R's got in before me.
733340,Roy,2012-09-28 22:37:00,13728, Could the braid have dried enough to slip on the spool?
733341,misfish,2012-09-28 22:38:00,29133, Very nice offer Garry. Was thinking the same thing. Mine are Right handed.  Darn backwards fisherman.LOL
733343,Roy,2012-09-28 22:41:00,13728,Could reel lubricant have gotten onto the carbon fiber drag washers?
733347,Garry2Rs,2012-09-28 23:08:00,1425," Hi Brian; I bought a Quantum PT Tour Edition in southpaw a few years ago. Our late friend, John Francis had one and I thought it was very smooth casting. My plan was to put it on a BPS flippin' stick that I never used...IMO, that's the only place a left handed reel might work better for a right handed caster. The fact is I never really liked this flippin rod, even with the new reel, so until I build a new rod for it, the reel is here gathering dust. 2R's"
733350,mistaredone,2012-09-28 23:16:00,913, You might be right. I did a home lube job after last use. The spool isn't sliping. When I turn the handle under pressure the handle will turn and the spool stays still. If I turn up the drag it takes more pressure to slip.
733351,misfish,2012-09-28 23:17:00,29133," You and I, are lucky to have something from him Garry. I have my ""MOJO"" float rod from him (as i call it). It,s got magic. Last pm from him about the rod was,hope you catch many fish with it. It has full filled many folds.  Sorry for the side track."
733352,Roy,2012-09-28 23:20:00,13728,"If it's that, it a relatively easy fix and you've saved yourself a reel. You can still buy a new one  but you'll at least have a backup."
733353,Christopheraaron,2012-09-28 23:21:00,3525,"I say you right handers are backwards, I'm right handed but I like to put my dominant hand into controlling the bait, the cranking requires less work."
733354,Roy,2012-09-28 23:22:00,13728, John will never be a 'sidetrack' for us me brudder.
733356,misfish,2012-09-28 23:29:00,29133,BRUDDER
733357,mistaredone,2012-09-28 23:29:00,913,Roy you might have saved me some big $$$. Both my Muskie reels had the problem. Is soon as I saw your post I turned the car around. Worst case I hit a tackle shop around bell river in the morning
733360,Roy,2012-09-28 23:37:00,13728, Hope it works out for you. Good luck on LSC! I'm sure lotsa folks could lend you a reel or two till you get yours cleaned up...or whatever they need.
733405,mistaredone,2012-09-29 11:40:00,913,I was up till 2am trying to fix the problem with no luck. Going to try a few tackle shops on the way.  Thanks for the offer Garry very generous!
733409,Gregoire,2012-09-29 12:23:00,1397,"I wish I had seen this earlier as I have a few lefty reels that are gathering dust here. They are revo toro's. There is nothing wrong with them, I just prefer shimano reels. If you are looking for another abu record gagnons might still have them in stock."
