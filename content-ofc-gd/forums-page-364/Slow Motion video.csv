733051,jedimaster,2012-09-27 15:09:00,3472,I made this on the weekend while I was up north scouting for grudgerun and doing soe sighting in for the deer season. Lined up threed dead Hard Drives and shot it with a 30-06 at 300 yards.. then recorded with a gopro hero2 at 720p 120 frames per second. the vdieo is cropped though. Next time out I'll move the camera closer and try and get a better video. hopefully I don't miss and hit the camera. lol   http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5PPe09ZpZwI

733056,ttahhan,2012-09-27 15:25:00,191,"Looks pretty cool, if you were to find 3 more dead hard drives try filming from a 45 to 60 degree angle as opposed to dead on So when you edit it and slow it down, you will be amazed of what you don't see....and yes go closer, just hope your cam doesn't get ricochet in the process..."
733059,jedimaster,2012-09-27 15:29:00,3472,  I have many dead hard drives... I wish I video'd this heat sink we shot with a muzzleloader....
