732763,mistaredone,2012-09-26 15:18:00,913,"The winds last weekend post poned my LSC trip but the forecast looks good for this weekend:)  The plan:  Launch Sat morning from the Thames or Bell river and troll the main lake.  If we can find weed beds do some casting. Sunday the wind picks up to 10km NE so we will launch out of the Detriot river  The questions:  Any recomendations for hotels/motels in Windsor or Bell river areas?  Any areas I should worry about leaving my boat over night? What will the water clarity likely be this weekend DR and main lake? No rain forcasted Thursday 15km NE, Friday 10km NE, Sat 5km E, Sun 10km NE?  Thanks  Steve"

733233,mistaredone,2012-09-28 14:26:00,913,"Thanks for all the replys. I took up Lews suggestion on the petite Dragon, well priced and great location.  Mark, I'll give you a shout this weekend. If your around when we are trolling your area we'll defiantly stop by fer a pop."
733236,lew,2012-09-28 14:33:00,12766," If you like Chinese food there's a great little place right beside the motel, and across the street from there is a 24 hr Timmies.  The marina is just north of the motel and at the far end of the pier is a nice restaurant where the group of us go for breakfast every morning."
733293,Wendel,2012-09-28 20:19:00,213," Looking forward to it, good luck tomorrow morning!  And yes, Lew, that is a great place for breakfast... Never had the Chinese from there, but that's good to know as well, we usually order pizza from Chochi's... it's usually pretty good but they close pretty early sometimes."

Ended at a tackle shop in London and grabed a shimano 301te and had them put a power handle on and also picked up a Cardiff, bulldawg, kickin minnow and some handlebars. 0 for 3 but a great day on the water still. Trolled the hump and lost one 40s fish. The rest came on bulldawgs around the mouth of the Bell in a short window. Detroit river in the morning"
