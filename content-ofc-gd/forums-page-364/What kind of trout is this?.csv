733287,fisherkid4,2012-09-28 19:50:00,32,"Fish wasent kept lived to swim another day wouldn't have the heart to string up a beauty like that, although I bet it would be pretty darn tasty"
733290,BillM,2012-09-28 19:55:00,17367,Glad you released it!  Awesome looking fish.
733140,fisherkid4,2012-09-28 00:58:00,32,"Today afterschool we headed out on a local creek for browns and specs and i caught this fish. Not 100% sure what kind of trout it is but if i had to guess i would say cross between brown and speck, if theres even such a fish. The creek has resident browns and specs. thannks in advance.  Tight lines,    "
733145,GBW,2012-09-28 01:04:00,8460,goby...     Just kidding!  That was a bump to keep in near the top so someone would reply for you.
733147,wallacio,2012-09-28 01:07:00,475, You are indeed correct...it's a hybrid ie Brown/Brook Trout cross...known as a Tiger Trout.   A very cool catch as naturally produced specimens are relatively rare!
733148,Christopheraaron,2012-09-28 01:07:00,3525,"Almost looks like a tiger trout, really cool catch whatever it is!"
733150,Bondar,2012-09-28 01:09:00,817,Looks like a tiger trout ....
733151,Joeytier,2012-09-28 01:20:00,3990,I'd definitely say tiger trout.  Awesome catch dude!
733152,Gregoire,2012-09-28 01:21:00,1397,That is really cool. I was thinking tiger as well
733167,northernpike56,2012-09-28 02:15:00,717,"I've heard of tiger trout.... I thought they were supposed to be extremely rare, especially the wild ones? Nice catch regardless if it's wild or stocked, they are on my list of fish to catch as well as the aurora."
733185,Musky or Specks,2012-09-28 04:40:00,2710,Yes its a tiger looks exactly like one I electrofished out of a Creek near Brantford years ago
733189,misfish,2012-09-28 10:22:00,29133,First time I have seen one. Beautiful markings.
733204,azebra,2012-09-28 12:30:00,168,"Ooh neat, I have never ever seen one before but it sure is pretty. Good job"
733209,luclarochelle,2012-09-28 13:03:00,37,Another picture of it 
733237,mrdylan,2012-09-28 14:45:00,111,"Nice, I have never seen that before!!"
733239,fisherkid4,2012-09-28 14:48:00,32,"Alright thanks guys, wasent to sure. I'm pretty sure its a natural fish too. Haven't herd of any stockings in that creek for years."
733241,torco,2012-09-28 14:51:00,656,"Very cool, I have never seen one before."
733249,funfishing,2012-09-28 15:26:00,147,"A very rare catch, nice!"
733250,manitoubass2,2012-09-28 15:30:00,11391,Wow!!!! Thats a very cool looking trout!
733252,NAW,2012-09-28 15:43:00,4022,Right on.  That's a cool looking fish for sure.
733260,kickingfrog,2012-09-28 16:44:00,8333,"""Remarkable bird, the Norwegian Blue, idn'it, ay? Beautiful plumage!""   When can't you use a quote from Monty Python?"
733261,irishfield,2012-09-28 16:51:00,26272,How did it taste??  Neat markings!
733262,Christopheraaron,2012-09-28 16:52:00,3525," Let's see,  hmmm,  Nope, nothin'"
733264,FishTracker,2012-09-28 16:53:00,47,"Very neat catch, indeed!  What a perfect hybrid!"
733267,Richard S.,2012-09-28 17:05:00,75,We got an adult out of the streetsville ladder a few years ago. If I can find the pic that I have of it ill post it.  Rich
733269,GreenCanada,2012-09-28 17:15:00,375,Very cool Tiger... not very common!
733282,ehg,2012-09-28 18:48:00,2666,"Wow, never have seen this hybrid before. Tiger muskies are cool but this brown trout X brook trout cross is really uncommon."
