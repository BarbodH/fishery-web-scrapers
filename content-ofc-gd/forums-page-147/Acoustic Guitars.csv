947062,Sinker,2015-11-30 14:26:00,8692,I have played a bunch of these as well. Nice for sure. I like the canadian made aspect for sure.  Pick up a Taylor and play it though. You just know right away....the sound is incredible.  S.
947071,Headhunter,2015-11-30 16:11:00,5703,Walter's Music in Mississauga is having a sale on Taylor Guitars. Do a Kijjij search of the GTA and you will find a link to them. Just an FYI HH
947072,moose,2015-11-30 16:16:00,266,I just sold a limited edition 410 electric acoustic Mint shape Had lots of real low ballers from Toronto I received email from a guy from Timmins drove 7 hrs and didn't haggle with price Also had a guy from gander Newfoundland who wanted it but we needed someone to deliver to him
947073,Sinker,2015-11-30 16:18:00,8692,Thanks for that!  S.
947076,Headhunter,2015-11-30 16:43:00,5703,"If you know the model number you are interested in, I would make a call to them to get and idea about stock available and pricing. Save the drive time or it might make it worthwhile. HH"
947102,ecmilley,2015-11-30 18:09:00,2163,Had a gibson in my hand the other day sounded awesome but the $3200 price tag was a little off key
947107,Sinker,2015-11-30 18:24:00,8692,lol....so was the 900 series taylor I was playing last week. Over 5G's!!  S.
947144,craigdritchie,2015-11-30 21:38:00,1586,"Forget the name on the headstock and buy what feels good in your hands. I once splurged on a Martin D-35 ... it sounded amazing, but I hardly ever picked it up because it just wasn't comfortable to play. I replaced it with a Ovation that cost half as much, which I still own and play all the time. I also have an old Washburn dreadnaught that sounds great and just melts into my hands.  One thing I learned a long time ago is you can change the sound of any guitar to some degree by experimenting with different string brands, or going to lighter or heavier gauge strings. But if it isn't comfortable, you won't play it - regardless of how it sounds, what it cost, or what it says on the headstock. Maybe that explains the $300 Yamaha sitting next to the $2,500 Fender in my basement. Love them both."
947180,Sinker,2015-11-30 23:58:00,8692,"Yep, you gotta play them. Like I said earlier, I learned to play on a martin d28. Awesome guitar, sounds great, but doesnt play anything like the taylors ive picked up. Im not partial to any one brand, it just has to sound good, have a good pick up, and play like a dream. Im still trying guitars.....have it narrowed down to the $500 tanglewood, or the $1200 taylor......price has nothing to do with the decision.  Hope to get one in the next week or two. I want it for a jam on Dec 12.  Lits of players here, when we jammin?  S."
947182,ecmilley,2015-12-01 00:04:00,2163,Checked put vanhalterens in lindsay yet. They have all kinds of guitars to choose from

947281,Headhunter,2015-12-01 14:17:00,5703,"Earlier in the thread, someone mentioned the 12th Fret. They have rooms of acoustic guitars to look at, at all price ranges. Location isn't the best at Woodbine and Danforth. My thinking is that if you are spending that kind of money, it's worth the time and aggravation so you don't end up with buyers regret. HH"
947345,Fang,2015-12-01 18:43:00,1330,It's been several years but there used to be a neat guitar shop in belleville that sold lots of Taylors. Used to pop in after a days fishing  Ardens - looks like its still there and another store in trenton
947434,Sinker,2015-12-02 02:23:00,8692,"Well I pulled the trigger on a taylor tonight. I played this guitar a few days ago and knew then and there it was the one I wanted. Played many, many others trying to find one that sounds and plays as nice, but none compared. This one just spoke to me on the first strum.  Spruce top, rosewood sides and back, mahogany neck, fishman electronics, on a cutaway dreadnought body.  I couldnt be happier unless I paid twice the money, and even then it was mostly cosmetics.  Been banging away on it for a couple hours niw and dont want to put it down!!  S."
947435,chris.brock,2015-12-02 02:28:00,4053,We like pics Shane. We like videos with sound better.  You're happy and can't put it down = you made the right choice

947599,Andy,2015-12-03 00:43:00,330,210 CE. Nice. It will serve you well.
946763,Sinker,2015-11-27 19:17:00,8692,"So, who plays, and what are you playing?  I'm in the market for a new acoustic. Really like the Taylors, and really, that is what I want, but I picked up a Tanglewood, and I tell ya, its a sweet playing/sounding guitar.....anyone have one?? I don't think the new Martins hold a candle to the new Taylors, but if I could find an old Martin D28 it would be a hard decision. I've been playing everything I can find the last couple weeks, just to see, but its so hard to decide on just one.  Anyways, just wondering what you all play and like??  S."
946769,Headhunter,2015-11-27 19:38:00,5703,"I play bass and have almost as many as I have fishing rods!!!!! I run them through a Marshall VBA400 bass amp into a Bergantino NV 6x10 cab for gigs. I have a couple other back up amps as well. RE acoustics -  a friend of mine, a very good guitar player was looking for a new acoustic for his studio. He was intent on trying everything within his pretty significant budget. He tried a Martin that he liked the action on, but was somewhat blah one the tone. He found a Taylor that he loved the sound of, that he player for a good hour in the store. He then tried a Larrivve that he liked. He went back to the Martin and played it again and this time for half an hour. He owns the Martin. The Taylor he said has a sound that you appreciated immediately, but after some time was a one trick pony. The Larrivve was a good well made (Canadian) guitar and he would have bought it, but the Martin's tone was just more usable and good, that he had to buy it. Yamaha make a lot of guitar for the money as well. Good luck with your search. HH"
946773,Sinker,2015-11-27 20:05:00,8692,"Yep, I really like the Martins too. Grew up with one in the house, and learned my first chord on one, but the newer ones just don't seem to have it like the older ones. I hear you on the Taylors, they are sweet sounding right off the get go, and play awesome too....I've been playing a couple of them the last few times we've jammed, and honestly, that is what I was looking to buy, but there are just so many options....hard to choose. Best way is to play them all.  S."

946788,Sinker,2015-11-27 21:02:00,8692,"I played a few yamaha's last night. Almost bought one actually. Pick up a Taylor or martin though, and you know right away what you want. I'm not knocking yammies.....I just want a guitar that is going to keep me happy for a loooong time. I have a few others, its time to blow the dust off the wallet and get the one I really want.  The Tanglewood I played was real nice though. I'd never even heard of them, and really know nothing about them. It had great action, awesome sound, and the price was right too. Too many to choose from is the biggest problem!  S."
946797,irishfield,2015-11-27 21:26:00,26272,Only one I've ever played and learned on as a kid. The Dubro my mother bought from Sears in 1943.
946799,Fang,2015-11-27 21:29:00,1330,Own 2 Martins myself but I'm just a campfire strummer. Plan a trip into the city and go to Twelfth Fret. All the acoustics you can ever dream of are on the wall there. I played a Tanglewood a while back. Very nice guitar. Martin and Taylor's are top sellers in the mid to high end for a reason
946803,chris.brock,2015-11-27 21:40:00,4053,"Just like my 3 outboards, my acoustic guitar is also a Yamaha.  It's about 12 years old, paid about $800 originally, brand new. I really like it but I don't know enough on the topic to give you any advice."
946817,ccmtcanada,2015-11-27 22:33:00,7971,"I've played guitar for over 30 years now.  I have two acoustics at the moment....a cheap $300 Yamaha I bought about 25 years ago and a Fender semi acoustic.  The Yamaha has survived university years, where I found it once filled with beer...and then someone knocked it and it has a hole in the back.  I still play it today and love it!  When I record, I use my fender semi....has very rich tones and the action is incredible."
946863,KLINKER,2015-11-28 02:28:00,256,"When you try them out, try different guitars of the same make and model, you can sometimes find a difference in them.   EKO  Ranger Yamaki deluxe 2 songbirds not the Gibson but a mid level Korean, one I really like the other not so much Royal dobro gitane   anybody play gypsy jazz, neither do I but the thing is just gorgeous 70's sigma 12 string that I use a lot Sigma D42 that's sort of nice Sigma's were sanctioned copies of Martin vester 12 string,  like the sigma more Martin D1 Blueridge,  $30 brand new had a crack in the sound board.  Patched it and got a nice blueridge for under $100 I think there's one more  My BIL had a Yamaki custom set up and it turned out real nice he figures it compares to his D28"
946892,Andy,2015-11-28 12:42:00,330,"I have a Yamaha that I bought in '75 when I was 13, and it's a solid guitar. But a few years ago I bought a Taylor 214 that I love as much now as then. Easy playing and sounds great. I'm really into fingerstyle now. I know it's a low end Taylor with a composite back, but to me it sounds great and I can take it anywhere. Guitars are a very personal thing. I tried Martins and Larivees, but none of them seemed just right for me."

Having a jam tonight and playing a buddies taylor, but have a few others coming to mess around with too.  I played almost every guitar in the guitar boutique and long and mcquades, and have it narrowed diwn to the taylor or the tanglewood.  Seagull does have some nice ones, but the ones found played best and sounded best had no pick ups in them. I need to plug in....part of the reason im getting a new one.  S."

That being said, singingdog is absolutely right. My daughter plays an Epiphone Hummingbird, which doesn't sound as good as the Gibson model, but nice tones at the same time at a fraction of the price. But the real surprise was the Yamaha 12string that she has. Was around 600 and the sound is out of this world! My wife has an Ovation 12string that probably cost more than twice that and it doesn't sound as good as the Yamaha. That being said, she also has a Larrivee that gets way more attention and sounds amazing. I've got an Epiphone Masterbuilt that's seen better days, but I just make noise."

947049,singingdog,2015-11-30 11:27:00,1047,"Yep, Kijiji is only as good as your desire to drive around and sit in other peoples houses trying their guitars.  The other thing I will throw in the mix is this: buy the instrument that makes you want to play. Owning a vintage instrument that lives in the case all the time is a great way to not play very much. Owning a decent instrument that you don't mind leaving out on the stand is a great way to get better. Being able to walk by and pick it up for a quick practice session is one of the best ways to get better."
947050,Parnelly,2015-11-30 11:36:00,108,I also have an F35. Many of my friends that have played it seem to really enjoy the sound. Also have a 6 and 12 custom built acoustics. Fender seems  to be the better sounding guitar as far as the 6's go.

I can't really comment on any new guitars, because I don't know much about them.  But my old neighbor used to buy high end guitars and his last one that he really really liked was a Larrivee.  I've played it a few times, and it's a solid guitar.  Way over my price range though.  Edit..
