947819,irishfield,2015-12-04 00:17:00,26272,"Like I said to someone else that removed a thread a week or so ago. There's only one real rule in business, buying or selling, if you want to be successful and get what you want. You never speak in public about what you intend to do.... until is said and done!"
947822,DRIFTER_016,2015-12-04 00:30:00,10439,Yup!!! wait until the contracts are signed and the hands have shook.
943545,kickingfrog,2015-11-05 23:46:00,8333,"Not sure what to think.   http://fishingtackleretailer.com/bass-pro-shops-to-buy-cabelas/    Tackle industry retail giant Bass Pro Shops is exploring an offer for one of its largest competitors—Cabela’s, Inc. According to a Nov. 5, report from Reuters, Bass Pro Shops is in the process of securing financing for a potential offer that would target Cabela’s. Both parties declined Reuters’ requests for comment, though shares of Cabela’s have risen by as much as 13-percent in light of the news. Both companies operate substantial, multi-million dollar direct sales and retail destination-store operations. Cabela’s, a publicly owned company, reported $1.2 billion in revenue last year: $810.6 million of that came from retail stores; $349.9 million came from direct sales. Cabela’s operates 77 brick-and-mortar stores in the United States. Bass Pro Shops is estimated by Forbes to have brought in over $4 billion in revenue last year. It ranks as one of the 100 largest privately owned companies in the country. The Springfield, MO-based giant employs some 20,000 people in 94 retail stores spread across the United States. Fishing Tackle Retailer will continue to update this story as details emerge."
943549,misfish,2015-11-05 23:59:00,29133,"I will give one plus here on this.  BPS nows how to stock. This is where our local Cabelas failed.  As one that was so looking forward to thier arrival here, I am very disappointed.  EDIT to add  I have spent more $ at our local small guy shop. He has done well supplying  for the area."
943560,2 tone z71,2015-11-06 00:57:00,1311,They should buy Sail too then I'd have one stop shopping
943562,Fisherman,2015-11-06 01:16:00,7201,"As long as they don't close the store in Barrie, dammed if I'm driving to Vaughn."
943587,wormdunker,2015-11-06 07:58:00,1711,"I still prefer to shop at the smaller locally owned tackle shops.  Do some price comparisons & you'll save at the small shops.  So, if BPS buys Cabels - I don't really care!"
943607,Mister G,2015-11-06 13:56:00,1429,Not good for customers if BPS does in fact purchase Cabela's because Cabela's stellar customer service can't go any place but DOWN from there on out.
943625,hunteronwheels,2015-11-06 15:06:00,112,i wonder if this has anything to do with this http://www.heraldcourier.com/news/investor-encourages-cabela-s-to-pursue-strategic-changes/article_066966da-848e-11e5-a808-9b5b2a910e74.html
943984,colin519,2015-11-09 16:36:00,101,Meh SAIL or local shops. BPS once in a while but everything just seems cheap there.
943985,AKRISONER,2015-11-09 17:28:00,5558,"find myself going to bass pro simply because the sail in vaughan is in a stupid location.  Id much prefer to shop at sail, but taking a 15 minute driving detour on highway 7 crap show isnt worth it. Who came up with putting a store beside the highway nowhere near any local off ramps?"
943987,manitoubass2,2015-11-09 18:14:00,11391,Same here.  Plus you can get wicked discounts at ma and pa shops when your a loyal customer!  Plus youll gain a friendship?
943991,Dutch01,2015-11-09 18:38:00,1431,Also for $25 you can get a LeBaron membership and save 10% for a year. I did this when I bought my Terrova and saved +/- $175 right off the top.
944007,NANUK,2015-11-09 20:31:00,797,Customer service AND quality on most merchandise will suffer.
944014,misfish,2015-11-09 21:17:00,29133,"From what I understand, the Canadian stores are not owned by theUSA owner. Is this true?  I could not get something shipped from the USA stores, as the one here said they were Canadian owned, and they didnt do bussiness with the USA branches."
944015,Fisherman,2015-11-09 21:23:00,7201,"I'm sure there's a difference in the stores, however, I still get stuff shipped from the US Cabelas store if I find it cheaper when tax, exchange and shipping is factored in."
944036,Mister G,2015-11-10 00:17:00,1429,"From what I understand, the Canadian stores are not owned by theUSA owner. Is this true?  I could not get something shipped from the USA stores, as the one here said they were Canadian owned, and they didnt do bussiness with the USA branches. The big difference between Canada stores and USA stores are the size and price....many of the USA store are huge and price is much lower."
944040,misfish,2015-11-10 00:27:00,29133,"The big difference between Canada stores and USA stores are the size and price....many of the USA store are huge and price is much lower.   Thats not what I was getting at MR G. My point was, I could not have a product shipped to my local store from a USA store ( like they offer here in Canada ( AT NO CHARGE ). This is why I get the impression they are not owned by the same.  I have found the same with our local Wal mart. They do not carry anything close to what they do in the USA market, Yet, when I ask about getting a product shipped up here,I get the same answer. NO.  What,s up with that?  Im willing to pay what ever the dollar value is. I cannot see there being shipping costs,as they are shipping products up anyways.  This to me, would be great customer service. It,s a win win for all. NO?"
944041,creditmaster,2015-11-10 00:35:00,190,please dont  cause if they do cabelas will become as crap as bass pro
944375,DRIFTER_016,2015-11-12 17:47:00,10439,Some updated news out of the US.  http://www.kulr8.com/story/30496958/cabelas-employees-say-managers-confirm-store-will-close-jan-1   
944385,misfish,2015-11-12 18:18:00,29133,"Well if they close,Im sure Sail will move in here."
944448,TenInchJake,2015-11-13 01:22:00,21,"At least Cabelas has a Canadian website in $CDN with Canadian shipping. BPS has been here for what, a decade, and still hasn't gotten a Canadian website together. Screw 'em. And SAIL has the worst website ever, even worse than lebaron and that is saying something."
944454,chris.brock,2015-11-13 01:43:00,4053,"Love LeBarons but they get my vote for the worst website.  Canada is likely small potatoes in the equation, but If BPS is buying Cabela's, that's likely bad news for us consumers."
944475,DRIFTER_016,2015-11-13 03:50:00,10439,"And SAIL has the worst website ever, even worse than lebaron and that is saying something.  Is that even possible???"
944476,DRIFTER_016,2015-11-13 03:58:00,10439,I can honestly say that Johnny Morris of BPS fame is one of the nicest people I have ever met. He also listened to my complaints about his companies mail order business dealings with us Canooks. And he implemented the changes I requested which I thought was awesome. I also complained that his company and Cabelas both had free shipping deals to US addresses but not for us Canooks. Now their free shipping deals include Canada. I'm hoping their take over of Cabelas means free shipping deals from them as well.  Time will tell if they rebrand the Cabelas stores or keep them as a separate entity.
944488,misfish,2015-11-13 11:53:00,29133,"As for sails web site,ya sucks, but it,s only a 25 minute drive down the high way for me, and well worth the drive as their Vaughan store is well stocked. They also have knowledgeable staff. It was funny to hear from a river guy last weekend that the one near Hamilton was not very good. I would of thought they would all be the same.  Im curious to see,hear, if they are going to open up near here. I guess an email to them wouldn't hurt to ask.  That Richie guy, seems to have the inside scoop about these things."
944495,woodenboater,2015-11-13 13:08:00,2277,"At least Cabelas has a Canadian website in $CDN with Canadian shipping. BPS has been here for what, a decade, and still hasn't gotten a Canadian website together. Screw 'em...  ^ This. Tells me they're taking Cdn customers for granted. Sail may not have the same fishing lineups (that's what smaller stores are for tbh) but their camping section has enough variety for me."
