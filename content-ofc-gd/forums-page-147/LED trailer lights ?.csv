947713,msp,2015-12-03 17:39:00,1336,"Im going to be doing some trailer maintenance over the holidays. Im getting sick of blowing trailer bulbs all the time and was thinking of replacing my trailer lights with LED lights. I saw some on sale at Princess auto. Wondering if you guys have any recommendations. Pros/cons, installation ect.... Thanks"
947716,leaf4,2015-12-03 17:46:00,2466,"They are good from princess auto, I installed a pair on both of my dads trailers, utility and boat last year. No problems (except when he lent the utility trailer to a friend and he smashed the one side light so I had to redo that one on his friends $)"
947717,BillM,2015-12-03 17:48:00,17367,I run the PA LED lights on both the boat and utility trailer.  Zero issues.
947721,DRIFTER_016,2015-12-03 17:55:00,10439,"Yep, I also have the PA lights on my boat and skidoo trailers. The boat trailer lights have been working perfectly for several years now. The skidoo trailer was only upgraded last week."
947750,Fisherman,2015-12-03 19:29:00,7201,"They work, period."
947751,msp,2015-12-03 19:43:00,1336,"Any issues with wiring ? Should be pretty basic , No ?"
947761,BillM,2015-12-03 20:39:00,17367,"Any issues with wiring ? Should be pretty basic , No ?  No different then your standard trailer wiring."
947779,DRIFTER_016,2015-12-03 21:40:00,10439,"Nope, no difference."
947788,Fisherpete,2015-12-03 22:02:00,1814,I've been thinking of doing the same. Did you guys buy the 'submersible' ones or just the regular LED's? The price is pretty much double for the submersible if I can remember correctly.
947795,DRIFTER_016,2015-12-03 22:12:00,10439,Submersible. The LED's and circuit boards are completely epoxy shielded. Absolutely no way for water to get in.
947804,spincast,2015-12-03 22:46:00,3279,Submersible. The LED's and circuit boards are completely epoxy shielded. Absolutely no way for water to get in. yup.. Worth every penny. Last pretty well forever
947810,wormdunker,2015-12-03 23:51:00,1711,Yup go with the submersible LEDs.  I have them on both of my trailers.  I still unplug the lights just before launching.  Old habits I guess.
947811,misfish,2015-12-03 23:54:00,29133,"If Im not mistaken, the lights are already prewired. Just need to mount and fasten the wire. NO?"
947814,KLINKER,2015-12-04 00:05:00,256,They don't produce enough heat to keep snow off them.
947821,DRIFTER_016,2015-12-04 00:29:00,10439,They don't produce enough heat to keep snow off them.  Not a huge issue with the boat trailer. With the sled trailer it is more of an issue. Not worried though as you can easily see the lights on my truck and the LEDs are super bright and should be able to shoot through some snow. We'll find out in the new year.
947832,porkpie,2015-12-04 01:07:00,2521,"The submersible led trailer lights go on sale for 50 percent off pretty often.  They are awesome, I have em on both my boat trailers, you can't go wrong.  Just keep an eye on the flyers."
947849,spincast,2015-12-04 02:03:00,3279,They don't produce enough heat to keep snow off them. rub glycerin on them
947923,Fisherpete,2015-12-04 14:19:00,1814,Beauty. Thanks gents.
947996,misfish,2015-12-04 21:00:00,29133,"For the price of them Pete @ PA,if they last 2-3 years, you are saving no matter."
948048,206,2015-12-05 01:34:00,563,"Yup, just went to a pair of PA LED tails, so much brighter and dependable then old bulbs so far."
948279,Mister G,2015-12-07 17:27:00,1429,"I have them on my new trailer, but as everyone already mentioned they are better because they will not blow if you don't unplug during launching. But where they also shine (pun intended) is there no longer a problem with just having a little bit of corrosion on the bulb contacts that cause the bulb to go out half way home or just before your ready to leave on a early morning fishing trip."
948285,mike rousseau,2015-12-07 18:40:00,4661,Did LED submersible from Canadian tire this year....  They're great...  Used to blow like a half dozen bulbs a year...
948294,msp,2015-12-07 19:15:00,1336,Thanks for all the replies guys. Now I have my project for over the holidays
