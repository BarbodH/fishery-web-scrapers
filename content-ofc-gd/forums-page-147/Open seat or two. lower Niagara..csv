947487,highdrifter,2015-12-02 16:20:00,2534,Paul can't it wait till Sunday?!  We both know you're not gonna get squat without me in the boat..
947538,BillM,2015-12-02 20:53:00,17367,Without Joey in the boat all you'll be doing is releasing shiners!  :)   Goodluck boys!  Wish I could have jumped on this.
947573,Freshtrax,2015-12-02 23:09:00,2215,"We are licking our wounds.   lots of laughs were had,but we are both scratching our heads at the results.  Thanks again Paul for showing me the ropes on the lower i feel much more confident heading out in my boat now ."
947574,misfish,2015-12-02 23:11:00,29133,"  Are you sure you were fishing with the right Paul???????????    Oh well, you got out and had time on the water with one of the originals here."
947590,Freshtrax,2015-12-03 00:11:00,2215,"ok, they were slight chuckles, and they were  mostly at ourselves and our inaability to catch the dummest most suiciadal fish in lake ont while trolling, that somehow morphs into an elitist genius fish once it enters the river."
947591,BillM,2015-12-03 00:14:00,17367,"Was anyone else hooking up?  Some days it's a spoon bite out there, sometimes a shiner bite, etc.  I wouldn't feel too bad."
947593,Freshtrax,2015-12-03 00:23:00,2215,"we only saw a handfulll of fish landed all day and most were on the u.s. side...it was not a great day for most anglers out there today.   something was off.  viz was good, but paul said he temps were up from from sunday and 10 degrees warmer than this time last year so we blamed it on that."
947674,KraTToR,2015-12-03 14:08:00,506,Did you guys fish the bar or just the river??
947684,Tybo,2015-12-03 15:13:00,1373,"Thanks for the company  at the dirty old bar Andrew. Had a great time. Next time you get to work the trolling motor.  Kattor,We fished the river."
