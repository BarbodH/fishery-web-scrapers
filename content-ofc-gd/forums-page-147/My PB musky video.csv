Here's a raw clip of my biggest musky so far at just under 49 inches.  Before anyone says it... yes I bought a bigger net. Enjoy. Thanks for watching"

948382,chris.brock,2015-12-08 02:39:00,4053,"Seems like you put big fish in the boat Steve.  Cool to see that big ski was hooked, in the net, a couple pics and back in the water quick. She'll be there next year."
948416,mike rousseau,2015-12-08 05:28:00,4661,Nice fish   Very cool getting a second shot at her like that
948437,Gregoire,2015-12-08 13:42:00,1397,"I've actually had that happen while I was in the boat at LOTW fishing with Spence Petros. We were three in the boat and I was right beside him when he hooked up on the eight. On the hook set the bucktail came flying out of the fishes mouth right towards my head. Spence reacted in time to prevent the lure decapitating me, and when the the lure hit the water the fish ate it again. We called the method the slap back, and it has been used effectively a few times since then. Stupid fish!"
948471,PBenson,2015-12-08 18:55:00,154,Congrats nice fish
