However, the article above provides some interesting insights to the impact this gun toting mentality is having on a broad number of America's citizens.  Some on here won't change their opinion until their gun is pried from their cold dead hands. Charlton didn't recognize the irony inherent in that statement. Hopefully some can open their minds to an alternative position. Interesting comment from one of the readers of an article ...""Americans shoot other Americans... Canadians shoot with other Canadians""   but anyway just thought this was worth sharing."

948189,aplumma,2015-12-06 13:31:00,6896," There's lots of stories of accidental shootings, like a 3 year old accidentally shooting mom. Not so many stories of armed citizens gunning down bad dudes or terrorists. The media does not report near as many accidents from other reasons such as a middle age child killed after falling off the monkey bars. The gun shooting is a story that sells while the kid who fell is just a accident. The amount of time where the situation presents itself to step up and be the hero and save the public guns a blazing is very rare compared to the number of other ways people die. I still contend that a gun is a tool that when cared for , put away and used properly it will rust into scrape before it does anything bad.

It is a mindset for sure and Canadian mindset is something I envy and I wish it would work down here. The difference is the USA was not given independence we fought for it and won. We then wrote the Constitution and gave citizens certain rights to prevent a government from becoming a sole controlling force. Now with this time and society changed and we added rights to it and we blended them into the current laws governing the people. You have to take with a grain of salt what you are fed as facts up North some of the views I have read are way out of bounds and are expressed by people who have not ever visited the United States. I have been to Canada quite a few times but I only get a small snapshot of what life up North is because i visit the same 4 or 5 places every time.The same goes for down here we have places where you can shoot your guns out back and 10 miles away you can't even shoot a BB gun. We have places where you will not find 10 guns per 1000 people and others where you will find collections of guns that would make the police look like they have nothing. I am not scared by guns I have been trained to use them in the Sea Bees as well as in civilian life. I have yet to have some one draw a gun on me after my time in the service so it is not the wild threat that some are lead to believe. I also know that a day in the public I will pass by at least 20 people who have a concealed weapon and it is comforting to me. Crime needs victims and if you do not know who is armed and who is not you will have less opportunistic crimes. The ability to bear arms is part of a checks and balance that we rely on to feel safe as well as preserve a delicate balance that is not part of Canadian culture. I can sum it up with a meme I saw in the past it was someone had written in wet concrete ""sorry for vandalizing your concrete"" it instantly popped into my mind somewhere up in Canada before I read the next line that said "" Canadian gang signs"" .  This is not bad it just showed me that mind sets of different cultures make us each look at things differently. When I am up North I get to fish and philosophy  with some really great minds and it is refreshing to get views that I am culturally blind too.  Art"

If you don't have the ware with all to properly manage what's obvious, such as proper storage etc... then there is obviously something wrong with the system that allows those people access to firearms. HH  Exactly!!! In Canada before we can even think about purchasing a firearm we need to take a safety course. My course lasted for 6 weeks and was one night a week. Then there is written and practical tests to pass before you can apply for a license to even purchase/own a firearm. Then when you apply for your license (there are a couple of levels most often applied for unrestricted (long guns and shot guns) and restricted (handguns and other restricted firearms) you send in all the paper work and the RCMP runs a background check on you (takes weeks). Then if you are approved you get your license and are able to go into a gun shop and purchase a firearm. They take down all the info off the card when you purchase and after you pay for it you leave the shop. You have to renew your license every 5 years which helps weed out the undesirables (wife beaters, crooks) who have popped up. They are then denied a license because of their transgressions.  This keeps the majority of mental cases gun free. There are still illegal guns around but nothing like the States because down there the 2nd amendment says ""every body gets guns""!!! No training and lax background checks.  On black Friday the FBI got 185,000 checks to do. Tell me how they can manage to not make an error with numbers like that?  Our system may not be perfect but I do believe it is a lot better than the one in the US."

947764,BillM,2015-12-03 20:43:00,17367, I did my course 20 years ago. I do think it took several months before I had my card in hand.  I did my course a few years ago and it was months before I had a valid PAL in hand to actually purchase ammo or a firearm.
947766,JoePa,2015-12-03 21:01:00,179,So it takes 4 months before you can get a firearm - doesn't do the lady much good who is afraid of her ex-boyfriend does it - when he comes back a week later and kills her - its a God given right to be able to defend yourself and your family without having to go through the wringer to get a firearm - I can go over to Cabela's - pick out a firearm - rifle or handgun - go over to a computer and enter certain information - wait about a half hour and then pick up the gun and go home - that's the way I like it -  In Canada all it takes is the government to require all persons to turn in their guns and that's the end of your ability to defend yourself with a gun - or hunt - that can't happen here - I like my right to bear arms - a armed citizenry is a free citizenry - remember that -

They were renting the conference room for some event. No one has said who the group was that was using the room. Sounds like the group that rented the room was targeted."
