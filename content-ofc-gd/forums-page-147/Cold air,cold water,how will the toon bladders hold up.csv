My bud terry has got the fold aboat if we need to get out, but Im wondering how well the toon bladders will hold during the cold temps combined with the cold water. Been out in the spring with warmer air temps, but water was cold.  Will the 2.5 psi air pressure hold well out there?  This science thing has me boggled.  Thanks    "

948605,irishfield,2015-12-09 22:49:00,26272,Don't be nuts... if you really want to get out there come get my 14' Mirrocraft that is on top of the marine container!
948607,ketchenany,2015-12-09 23:30:00,3229,"Ya, don't be 'nuts' they may fall off. Listen to Wayne."
948609,John Bacon,2015-12-09 23:33:00,3277,Make sure you ensure that the air pressure is topped up after the pontoons have had a chance to cool off.  Brittleness of the material may be an issue in extreme cold too.
948619,DRIFTER_016,2015-12-10 02:46:00,10439,"Pump it up to spec when you get there. If air temp is colder than water temp you're good to go. If air temp is higher than water temp, put toon in lake for 5 mins then top up air pressure. You will be good for the day."
948672,BillM,2015-12-10 16:26:00,17367,Leave it in the truck overnight and fill it cold.
948677,steelhedrmatt,2015-12-10 18:11:00,278,Come over and fill with nitrogen. My Neighbor has a whole bottle full for the race car tires. Won't shrink.
948678,porkpie,2015-12-10 18:23:00,2521,I've used mine for retrieving divers in cold weather when hunting beaches. I never even gave it any thought.  You'll be fine.
948679,Terry,2015-12-10 18:24:00,14456,Folding boat seems better then toon
