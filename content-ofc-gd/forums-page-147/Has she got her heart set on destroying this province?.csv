It avoids the owners here from having to move them and then getting PMs on why we moved the topics. We like to keep it polite and simple around here please help us as best you can.  Thanks   Art

Teachers that get sick for an extended period (over the 10 days) get 90% of their pay for up to another 120 days per year at 90% of pay. That is a short term disability plan and that is a very good plan.  After 120 days on short term sickness they go on long term disability and get benefits after that.  Don't get me wrong, I respect teachers as a profession, but don't go crying that they don't have good disability and sickness benefits because that is just not true.  Teachers have gold plated benefit and pension plans.  Significantly better than most of the non-government workers in Canada.  And as for the ""In other words, 6 months pay as gratuity after 25 years of service."", the pension benefits for teachers are way above anything anyone could get in non-government jobs.  And its secure (ask the Steelworkers how important that is).  Getting 6 months unused sick time payout on top of a gold plated pension plan is and was abusive.  As an indication of just how abusive it was, Dalton McGuinty thought it was abusive and a waste of taxpayer money.  Think about that statement for a minute."

You don't get paid out for unused leave when you retire or anything like that but you can rack up time that you can use if needed. There are several people here on staff that had cancer and needed extended time off for treatment and recovery. The ability to use sick leave is very beneficial as you can't apply for disability payments for 12 weeks. I know I would have a very difficult time with no $$$$ coming in for months.

It is for use if you get sick, not a bonus for not getting sick. We don't get paid out for unused sick leave or special leave (death, family member sick).

You guys are soooooooo screwed!!!    http://www.am980.ca/2015/12/02/auditor-generals-report-slams-ontario-liberals-electricity-system/   The annual report from Ontario’s auditor general presents a scathing review of the electricity system while also exposing a lack of co-ordination in government funding to companies. Released on Wednesday, Bonnie Lysyk’s report finds the electricity portion of hydro bills for homes and small businesses rose 70% between 2006 and 2014, costing consumers $37-billion in payments to generators. In addition, Lysyk says customers will pay an extra $9.2-billion for wind and solar projects under the Liberal’s guaranteed-price program for renewable energy than they would have under the old program. The report also went after government funding to companies, noting that 80% of $1.45-billion from the Ministry of Economic Development and Employment went to companies the Liberals “invited to apply”, but there was no criteria given to show how the firms were selected or whether any jobs were created. Lysyk also found a lack of coordination in government spending, with nine other ministries handing out another $1.8-billion dollars for similar projects and no follow-up after the funding ended to see if jobs created or retained still existed.

There's so much misinformation, lies, propaganda, posturing, mud slinging, etc. with these teachers unions and the province I don't think anyone, including the teachers (based on comments from a few I know personally) knows what's true and isn't anymore.  But I will say, aside from any propaganda or whatever, it is really difficult to get sympathy from people working in the private sector for these teachers. Sure, it's a difficult and important job, but it's not like you're living in poverty here. And I know it's not just about the money, but then you claim you want better environments for the children but at the same time hold them hostage? Something doesn't add up.  Ironically enough, it was the big push from the teachers union that got this government elected. But you didn't really think all your wishes would come true, did you?"

Assuming it was used as a currency in negotiating past deals (that they accepted in lieu of something else), I wouldn't be quick to vilify them for wanting to keep what they have (or had).  A friend and I were discussing this and he came up with this analogy.....imagine you were going to leave your company for another job because it was higher paying.  Your boss comes to you and says  ""I can't afford to give you a raise, but what if we give you every other friday off instead"".   That might seem like a pretty good deal and a fair trade.  So you take the deal at less $ but get fridays off, and but then years later everyone else at your company gets out the pitchforks and vilifies you for having a special deal with fridays off when everyone else has to work 5 days.

They have frozen the buildup of these days already. Some teachers in our board with less than ten years experience had their accumulated sick days that they banked and were promised under past contracts forcibly paid out at pennies on the dollar. Not whining - just a fact. Don't believe everything that u hear in the media or secondhand. I am not trying to convince u to root for me as a teacher. It's a free world and you are entitled to your opinion - just be aware that the government and media are not sharing the whole or real story.  I sincerely hope that my Union is being honest with me and have faith so far that they are. Like I said, ""I"" and most teachers want a cost of living increase (u may or may not agree with that), to not lose family health or sick benefits and we also truly want class sizes and special education funding to not take a hit because that hurts kids and makes it more difficult for us to provide the best experience possible for your child. That's the honest truth for me. I am passionate about maintaining a world class public education system. It's not perfect - we're not perfect. But the majority of educators are skilled, hard working and deeply care about their students. I agree, due to unionization, some are not. I wish strike action did not need to happen but that is not the reality we are facing right now. On a side note, are people out there in the private sector not getting some type of cost of living or salary indexing right now? I'd like to hear either way if u don't mind."

My father has had his pay DECREASE for the last six years straight...he's an industrial electrician.

There are times when I want to commend the teachers union for sticking up for the people and not accepting that the people on top should be allowed to stay cozy by taking a bigger cut for themselves. I honestly think there's a lot of jealousy in these arguments. But to be frank, I think people are becoming complacent again and are just all to happy to have SOMETHING to take home because they know there are a dozen guys waiting in the wings to take their job if they step too far out of line. That, or if everyone bands together the company will just ship operations overseas.  But then these are the same people who think the biggest concern when voting is the ""economy"". Well, unfortunately, true economics is void of ethics and morals. If keeping the economy afloat means not having to pay anyone, which is slowly becoming the case, then they surely will do it."

In the good times, when companies are making money, salaries go up, and everyone is happy. However, in these tough times, when the private industry hasn't had good growth in a long time, salaries and wages aren't exactly climbing up any ladders. You can only blame the employers so much...(of course, if your in an industry that ""does"" have growth, this really doesn't apply).  In the public industry, where salaries and wages aren't directly tied to profits, at least not in the same degree as the private industry, you can get things like guaranteed salary indexing...in some cases, right through retirement.

That was before this year; but it was still during the McGuinty/Wynne years when they were supposedly restoring all of the cuts by Mike Harris.  As far as the increase in the total number of nurses.  How does that compare to the increase in population?  Ontario's population has increased significantly since 2003; obviously, we will need more nurses.  If your friend's department had 20 nurses that were laid off, but 30 more were hired in another new department is that is an increase or a decrease in the number of nurses. Without knowing the staffing levels of the entire hospital before and after any such changes it is impossible for anyone to say with accuracy.  As for the number of nurses being increased by the same percentage as the population, that is a fine question, feel free to look it up.

I could have been working like my buddies were for 30,000 a year. That put me behind them by about 200,000 - but it was an investment in my future and I don't regret it and am not whining about it. I am not going to tell you my job is harder than yours - I have never walked in your shoes. I have a great job. I love it. But like all jobs, it looks way easier from the outside. Ask my students parents and they will tell you I work hard and go beyond expectations for their family. I never whine about my job. What I do hate though is having my contract negotiation and ""myself"" being misrepresented in the press. The facts are right now that OPSBA has been refusing to meet with our union and purposely stalling. Of course they are offering us a ridiculously slashed contract so far (not the same as the high school teachers got btw - that's a lie) - but that's just good bargaining tactics. Now Kathleen is swooping in and finishing the plan by imposing a deadline when we, all teachers, have been wanting to talk and compromise all along. Don't believe everything you read in the media. Teachers care about class size and kids greatly. Do they care about themselves too - dam right. I have taken benefit cuts and pay freezes or ""raises"" that were actually below the cost of living many times in my twenty plus years teaching. Nobody, including you Moxie, wants their family to move backwards. And I ask you this - do you really want to strip away Health Care and Education bit by bit until we have what the Amricans have - a two tiered system where the wealthy send their kids to private schools and get immediate service when sick while the rest are stuck with second rate schools and hospitals. As stated, I like my job a lot and I am proud to help families raise their children BUT I am strongly encouraging my children to steer clear of teaching. Why would I want my daughter to invest years of time and money to land in a job where the media and many community members will automatically assume the worst of her and insinuate she is not a hard worker. In twenty years will their salary and benefits even be worth striving for. I worry they will not. I realize this is happening to other ""middle class"" workers too and it's wrong. Big corporations and government officials are not feeling the pinch like you and I. The gap is growing bigger while the increasingly poor bicker amongst themselves   Take a step back - the middle class that most of us are part of is disappearing.

941830,moxie,2015-10-26 17:51:00,1566,"  The number one thing that irks me about those that teach is that they automatically assume others are uneducated, especially when its their ox that is being gored. Simply a cop out  Just because you may well be the brightest bulb in the box of dimly lit teaching bulbs does that mean that every one of you must rape....er I mean reap the same financial rewards because a public union(Conflict of interest) deems it should be so? My uneducated mind must be missing something.  About tiers in health and education. Sorry to inform you from my uneducated point of view but i'm afraid they already exist which is another aspect of a contradiction in terms. Why must we pay out of pocket if there is already a system in place. Maybe due to the fact our publicly financed institutions are falling well short of expectations. Even to an uneducated mind they would seem to be second rate.  When speaking about compensation I would appreciate it if you refrained from insulting our intelligence. The media can spin any yarn they wish. The numbers do not lie.  Regarding the ""Middle Class"". We all pay taxes and I would like to see public hangings take place when they are mismanaged but am I to understand that if it costs me more to prop up the public service I will be better served by it financially? At this rate you remaining a part of the ""Middle Class"" will mean my demise from it.Sacrifice the many to save the few. Probably another one of my uneducated guesses.  We are paying too much for a system that is too fat and carrying a lot of dead weight. Tired and broken on many fronts and it is time for an enema. That I am willing to throw hard earned tax dollars at.  Until teachers and the rest of the public sector understand we are in this together things will never get better.  I have a great deal of respect for the institution that is Education but I'm afraid it has become anything but .  I apologize for any uneducated perspectives in this post. I now need to go out and purchase another keyboard as the drool has rendered this one inoperable."

The public wants more nurses, but doesn't want the deficit or taxes to increase.  Hospital administrators are dealing with only a 1.1 increase in funding year over year this year.

940384,Jigger,2015-10-18 16:34:00,1237,"Harper, in his time, has silenced science, turned Canada into a warring country and done everything in his power to turn our natural wonder into a pipeline. Let's not forget he was ONLY 46 when elected. Oh, and how many times did he prorogue parliament when things weren't going his way? How many of his hand picked ministers walked out on him? Even Flaherty, who was his most trusted advisor left. Flaherty, who told him the income split was a bad idea on grounds of discrimination and that an income tax deduction would serve The People much better. Who's proposing this now? Not Stephen.  Trudeau may be young and come from a privileged background , but so was Kennedy. At least he has passion for what it means to be Canadian. He finished school, do some research people. Worked for non-profits and travelled the world. Harper had never done these things prior to being Prime Minister. It's time for a change."
940400,Big Cliff,2015-10-18 18:00:00,6899,"It's the change to WHAT that scares me, if I thought anyone else had a chance against Trudeau I would vote for them but I am afraid that at this point a vote for anyone else but Harper is going to be a vote for Justin. Tomorrow I have to decide then no matter who gets in, wait and see."

Trudeau is a horrible speaker and im not sure what he brings to the table? He seems confident NATO protects him if elected.  When was Canada ever a leader in military force?  Its been along while since we kicked the US in the hiny lol.  I hate saying this but Harper may just be our best puppet  If that's our best puppet, God save us...    "

Also January 1st my gross pension will be reduced by 15%. All I have to do is look down at my right leg and see the scars from 2nd and 3rd degree burns that was the result of being splashed by 2700 F hot metal, my left leg has the burn scars from when my pants caught on fire when I was standing in the iron trough shoveling red hot coke out of it. A few herniated lumbar discs after a 500 pound Blow Pipe slipped from a chain fall and trapped me between it and the 300 some odd degree Hog Spool Piece.

I find it bizarre that Toronto tax payers go crazy if the city talks about a 1% property tax hike that will cost the average family $100. But they will vote in that Trudeau kid that will raise taxes by way more than that. You can't fix stupid I guess.  Harper is not a flashy guy. He's not that nice. But he is a tough focused leader. He is highly respected by international leaders. He has my vote.

The tough part here is big business wants the breaks and the big bonuses or they'll just go somewhere else and get it sadly, tough to play ball when its always in the other guys hands ie Siemens down to Carolina, that was $500,000 a year in business for the company I work for because of the size of the facility we had a guy there full time for just maintenance, who would in turn say this should be replaced/serviced whatever and the cheque was written to do it without a second question"

Just look at what Caterpillar did. Corporate, in some cases, are leeches and need to be reigned in. While I won't get into the issues of unions ( I happen to think they're needed but if people were treated right they would not exist), Cat seemed esp aggrieved to have to work with them and thus chose to act like a petulant child and grab all the marbles and leave the playground.  From a Globe and Mail article in 2012  ""Eight days ago, Caterpillar reported record annual profit of $4.9-billion (U.S.), an 83-per-cent increase from $2.7-billion in 2010. That came from record sales of $60.1-billion for one of the signature companies of Corporate America"""

939171,Andy,2015-10-12 12:33:00,330,"It is so sickening. She is so out of touch with everyday Canadians. Justin is no better. A kid with a trust fund and hundreds of thousands of dollars to play with from speaking engagements. What do either of them know about the real challenges of trying to raise a family in Ontario. Or retire on a pension with skyrocketing hydro bills, taxes etc. Don't worry tho, the Pan Am game executives walked away with millions in perks and bonuses. They'll be able to stay warm this winter. While our doctor's do with less. It's grotesque."

Especially with the feds poised to cut health transfers in less than 2 yrs...  Not true.  Health care transfers will increase by the greater of 3% or average rate of growth in GDP over the last three years.  It may be less than the 6% annual increase that they have received since 2006 but it is not a cut.  The cuts to health care transfer occurred in the mid 90s when the Liberals were in power.  Health and social transfers were $18.9 billion in 1993 and $12.5 billion in 1997.  http://www.fin.gc.ca/fedprov/his-eng.asp"

Somebodies math must be from the new curriculum... because it doesn't add up to me.  That is why I love politics though it is all about the spin...  With the respect to the transfers being cut in the 90's. Why do you make no mention of the fact the IMF said if we didn't stop the run away spending of the Mulroney years we would be in the situation Greece is in now.  So the government had not choice to cut at ALL levels. The feds forced cuts onto provinces Harris downloaded cuts on to municipalities, because in the end there is only one taxpayer and we were living way beyond our means.  Unfortunately, for the kids today we still are at all levels of government."

939210,porkpie,2015-10-12 16:18:00,2521,Political satirists have been making fun of the appearance of politicians male and female for eons.  It's a time honoured tradition.  I wouldn't get too worked up about it.  I'm a conservative voter and routinely make fun of Harpers Lego man hair cut.

Unfortunately, for the kids today we still are at all levels of government.  The way I read it, the individual doctors will have to take a pay cut.  But total compensation to all doctors is up by $100 million per year; perhaps there are more doctors.  The cut to the individual doctors is a real cut."
