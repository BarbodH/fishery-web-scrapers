948448,John Bacon,2015-12-08 14:55:00,3277,"Cliff, try this; 401 to Medowvale north, past the Zoo and then a left at the 4 way stop. I believe that is Steeles. HH  Meadowvale does not go al the way to Steeles.  There is a 4 way stop at Meadowvale and Old Finch.  If you make a left there you can take Reesor Rd or Sewels Rd up to Steeles."
948451,bigbuck,2015-12-08 15:04:00,2449,"Congrats on the new job! Getting in to work is not bad seeing as you leave early enough. The issue will be getting home. Try Steeles across to Meadowvale or even further across. Otherwise, the 407 will become your best friend to get home."
948458,lew,2015-12-08 16:25:00,12766,My brother commuted from Durham into downtown Toronto every day for about 25 years.  He theory was you'll never beat the traffic jams and if you let it worry you or continually look for shortcuts you'll go bonkers.  His way was just close the car windows and put your favorite music on the radio and go with the flow.  Said he always reached his destination relaxed and in a good mood.  Always made sense to me but then again I could walk to work in 20 minutes LOL
948460,Headhunter,2015-12-08 16:45:00,5703," Meadowvale does not go al the way to Steeles.  There is a 4 way stop at Meadowvale and Old Finch.  If you make a left there you can take Reesor Rd or Sewels Rd up to Steeles. Doh! You are correct John... Cliff, take Reesor Road, first right on Finch by the zoo. It will get you to Steeles. HH"
948465,Toronto_Angler,2015-12-08 17:28:00,698,Congrats on the new job. I know the Lenovo campus very well as I'm also in the IT field and work with them a lot. I know you are against the 407 but the amount you save in time and even gas money by not idling in traffic will more than make up for it with a transponder.
948495,ccmtcanada,2015-12-08 22:18:00,7971,"Thanks for the suggestions everyone!  Commute in was great taking 401 and 404.  Was door to door in 45 minutes.  I'm not against the 407, just wanted to investigate other routes as well.  Took 407 east after work and it took 50 minutes.  Love this commute compared to my old one at Yonge and Eglinton!"
948496,ccmtcanada,2015-12-08 22:18:00,7971,I've already ordered my transponder
948499,Rodbender,2015-12-08 22:44:00,1027,I drive Ajax to Oakville or Mississauga everyday but I'm out the door latest 5am and home about 3pm 401 isn't too bad then if I have a call in Vaughn later in the day I take 16th ave to Donald Cousins then to HWY7
948339,ccmtcanada,2015-12-07 23:04:00,7971,"As some of you know, I was in the retail industry for over 20 years. Last year my job was eliminated and I decided to take some time off to spend time with my daughter and work on projects around the house.  Well...the time has come for me to get back to work!  I start my new job in the IT industry tomorrow.  I no longer have to drive to downtown Toronto as I did before. The offices are at Steeles and the 404.  My question is this.  I live in Whitby and am wondering if anyone else in this area commutes to Steeles and the 404 area daily?  Is it fastest to still take the 401 to the 404 and head north? I'm not interested in taking the 407....so what about going north and taking 7 across?  Or maybe take Taunton (which turns into Steeles) and head that way?  Any advice would be great."
948342,ecmilley,2015-12-07 23:11:00,2163,I did that.commute to.404/steeles till 2011 no realnfast way there. But 401 is still faster than steeles anyday. 407 is fastest if.ypur in north end.but rapes u on price
948344,John Bacon,2015-12-07 23:20:00,3277,"401 to 404 won't be too bad in the morning.  But, I wouldn't to have to try to get from 404 south to 401 east in the afternoon rush hour.  Taking 14th Avenue east part of the way to avoid the 404/401 intersection is an option."
948345,irishfield,2015-12-07 23:21:00,26272,"My sister did that route from Church St in Ajax and caved in and got a transponder for the 407, just shortly before she kicked the can in 2009 and I had to return it to ETR407. At least you skip the expensive part of the fee by having the txpndr."
948347,misfish,2015-12-07 23:26:00,29133,"I have no idea Cliff,,,,,,  But welcome back to the weekend shoulder to shoulder river bank gang."
948351,chris.brock,2015-12-07 23:32:00,4053,There's ways to drive the 407 without getting charged. That's what I do.  PM me if interested.

948354,chris.brock,2015-12-07 23:40:00,4053,"If there's a top 10 most wanted list for 407 thieves, I'm likely on it."

948358,irishfield,2015-12-07 23:49:00,26272,"LOL, I've made countless trips, with a 12' crate hanging out the back of my truck, box for free!"
948360,ccmtcanada,2015-12-07 23:51:00,7971,Thanks for all the input guys!!  I've often thought...why don't drivers unite and tailgate each other as you pass the cameras?   That way only the last guy gets charged.  Lol  Maybe I will take the 401 in the morning and 407 home.  I was paying $250 a month for parking downtown...no parking fees at the new job!
948361,lew,2015-12-07 23:55:00,12766,"Congrats on the new job Cliff, hope it's everything you want."
948362,ccmtcanada,2015-12-07 23:59:00,7971,"Thanks Lew!  After sending in resume after resume to companies and not hearing a single response, this job came on my radar.  It truly is an amazing opportunity for me....combining my previous experience in a new field I've always been extremely interested in."
948363,Gallie,2015-12-08 00:00:00,1215,"I used to work at lawerence and kennedy and its taken me 1 hour to get from steeles and 404 to 401 and kennedy. I would absolutely avoid this route home. Generally the farther north you can stay on the way home the better but i use better loosely lol. As for the way in i havent done it from the east very much so i have little insight, thats why i work out of our innisfil yard now. If i had to start driving to scarlem again i would quit."
948390,John Bacon,2015-12-08 03:10:00,3277,Maybe I will take the 401 in the morning and 407 home. I was paying $250 a month for parking downtown...no parking fees at the new job!  That's what my wife does.  Same logic too.  She no longer has to pay to park; so she users her parking money for the 407.
948399,GBW,2015-12-08 04:07:00,8460,407 Cliff. When I was in Whitby working at Dell I would take the 407 to Warden on my way in (but get on the 407 much closer to Markham then where it starts) and reverse that home. Most of the time I got on the 407 just before 9th line and would take HWY 7 when not on the 407.
948417,Sinker,2015-12-08 05:29:00,8692,"407 is the only way to roll imo. My time is money, and I save a lot of time on 407!!! Sitting in traffic sucks!!  S."
948427,ccmtcanada,2015-12-08 12:50:00,7971,"Update....left at 7am this morning from Whitby and arrived at the office 43 minutes later.  Took 401 to 404 to Steeles.  Drive home won't be as good I'm sure, but at least coming in was a breeze!  Thanks everyone for your suggestions!!"
948434,ketchenany,2015-12-08 13:31:00,3229,"Cliff we are working close again  I was at the Yonge location for many years, now I'm at 225 Sparks just off Vic park and south of Gordon Baker.  Are you at Tangerine?"
948435,ccmtcanada,2015-12-08 13:33:00,7971,I'm at Lenovo now.  Basically right at Woodbine and 404.

948443,NAW,2015-12-08 14:28:00,4022,I can't comment on driving routes.  But congrats on the new gig!
948446,Fang,2015-12-08 14:45:00,1330,As an alternate on the way home check out 14 ave/Alden Rd and head east. It gets gradually better the further east of 404 you get. It'll get you far enough where you can get back onto Steeles. I have a number of customers in that area north of Steeles and it's generally my escape route out.
