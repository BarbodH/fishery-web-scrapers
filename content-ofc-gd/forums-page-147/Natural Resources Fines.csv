946426,irishfield,2015-11-25 17:33:00,26272,"They needed an example for new legislation going through and they got it big time. Other than this mess, Charles came across as a perfect southern gentleman when he flew his airplane all the way up from Mississipi for me to work on in May 2000. He does actually own property in Alaska. Unfortunate that his son lost his $225K US SQ4, although it's not the first aircraft they ""lost"" to Alaska. (picture in 2003 standing in front of the one I worked on). Charles getting to sit in the clink, at 70 years old, for 18 months is a bit tough but it is what it is! I'm sure he'll be out and back on an oil rig in the Gulf of Mexico before Spring."
946427,BillM,2015-11-25 17:39:00,17367,"The 70 year old isn't doing time from what I can gather in the article, his son is."
946449,AKRISONER,2015-11-25 19:24:00,5558,"meh 18 months isnt a long enough total jail time IMO...these animals were quite literally murdered.  Theres a reason that animals are available for limited harvest, breaking that code is a violation of nature itself it to me is in the same realm of animal abuse i.e. dog fighting and the like.  If we are willing to throw someone in jail for their entire lives and even execute them in some cases for killing people, why would 18 months in jail justify this clowns multiple illegal kills of animals.  Glad they hurt their bank account, but at the same time these guys have plenty of money, money made from filming this garbage. The penalty doesnt justify the crime committed.  Also i would hope that now that these clowns are felons, their weapons should all be confiscated forevermore"
946465,irishfield,2015-11-25 20:10:00,26272,"Sorry Bill, misread it. Clark probably belongs there, his father (like many would) was just trying to help him out and as I said does own property in Alaska, a good piece of it.  This is just one case conclusion, to what I remember right is over 13 different cases brought to various combinations of the same men.  All my Alaska flying friends are in a frizzy up there, terrified that if they even fly into someone's camp to say hello that their aircraft will be seized as part of a ""crime"" for flying same days as a hunt.  Envision me flying into your cottage and then having my airplane seized because we went out and legally fished a shoal that I may OR MAY NOT have flown over seeing fish on it.  It's a mess up there, I'll see if I can find the entire diatribe on this. Remember there is always three sides to every story and the Crown has the most money to make it work out how they like.  Not defending what transpired, but for a fair part the pool is tainted from what I've learned the past 3 years."
946468,irishfield,2015-11-25 20:14:00,26272,"As for ""plenty of money"". Like the vehicle you drive, the bank owns it in most cases and it's no different for most guys that have airplanes. A way of life, they chose to make payments on their way of getting around and most don't have deep pockets. Most are poorer than anyone that owns a boat I can tell you that! The Crown has his airplane now and somehow, while sitting in jail, he has to continue to pay the bank back while the State auctions of his craft to the highest bidder.  As for ""murdering"" animals, all would have been above board if he had of put his Mississipi home in his wife's name as sole tenant. This would have made him a legal guide with Alaska residency no doubt, but as I stated above with all they had against them there was no way out. They're paying the price for a show that most probably never heard of."
946471,bare foot wader,2015-11-25 20:29:00,1354,"Residency issues are no joke out west, LOTS of people take advantage of it, especially the guiding industry which is largely dominated by foreign owners....IMO this guy got what he deserved, sucks for his father, but he was clearly abusing the system, and not just on the residency issue  and then there's guys like Clayton Stoner with his grizzly, and half of Fort Mac that calls BC home, technically many do not meet the requirements to hunt or fish as a resident, even though they own homes in BC, pay taxes, support local economy, etc......the definition of residency needs to be revised...but I highly doubt that'll happen"
946482,AKRISONER,2015-11-25 21:26:00,5558,"like most cases where someone gets caught walking a thin line, people revert to blaming the system for their problems. You know the risks ahead of time, its too late to ask for forgiveness once you get caught.  These people were attempting to take advantage of a system and got caught, and are now being punished for their crime."
946551,Dara,2015-11-26 02:53:00,3052,Ask Mike Duffy about residency...I hear he is right up on that stuff now
