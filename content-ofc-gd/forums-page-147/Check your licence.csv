948036,irishfield,2015-12-05 00:42:00,26272,"Mine is one of them. I'd meant to make a note of it on my taado list, but I didn't . Thanks Rob."
948069,tbayboy,2015-12-05 04:05:00,1497,Damn thanks Rob.  Guess thats the downside with the 3 year license - forget to check it. Sure enough I'm down to 27 days!
948075,Woodsman,2015-12-05 10:21:00,1286,I'm still good for another 2 years.
948076,dave524,2015-12-05 10:43:00,4508,I'm good for the rest of my life.
948085,Acountdeleted,2015-12-05 13:14:00,2562,"Time for me to renew as well. 3 year sport, here I come!"

948098,crappieperchhunter,2015-12-05 15:03:00,2582,Dec 31 2016. I'm good for another year....but thx for the heads up.
948106,Nipfisher,2015-12-05 15:54:00,2449,I'm due for a renewal.
948116,kickingfrog,2015-12-05 17:35:00,8333,"Ya, I'm good for another year but a reminder next November/December would be helpful."
948125,wormdunker,2015-12-05 20:44:00,1711,I'm good till end of 2016.  Woo Hoo!  After that I will only need to pay for another 2 years.  Then finally I'll be able to fish without the fees!
948129,misfish,2015-12-05 21:33:00,29133,"Ya, I'm good for another year but a reminder next November/December would be helpful.  Rob, I,ll remind you,if I remember."
948144,GBW,2015-12-05 23:06:00,8460,I was at a Service Ontario centre about 10 days ago and she said Dec 15th and on if doing it in person.
948158,LostAnotherOne,2015-12-06 00:32:00,956,You don't save any money if you buy three years instead of one right?
948159,irishfield,2015-12-06 00:33:00,26272,But you certainly save a lot of hassle. One card... no accompanying paperwork to carry from your one year renewals.
948160,John Bacon,2015-12-06 00:53:00,3277,You don't save any money if you buy three years instead of one right?  If they increase the price you will.  But reduced hassel is the main benefit.
948161,LostAnotherOne,2015-12-06 00:56:00,956,"Thanks guys.  For years I only did the one year, but makes sense to go with three."
948164,Whopper,2015-12-06 01:45:00,2174,I wish I would have done the three year this time around. I hate carrying the paper license
948199,BillM,2015-12-06 16:24:00,17367,"Still have a year before mine expires, although this thread made me check! lol!  thanks Rob!"
948201,kickingfrog,2015-12-06 16:39:00,8333,That's exactly what I did as well. The 3 year option is convenient but does cause me some concern in early January sometimes.
948210,manitoubass2,2015-12-06 20:16:00,11391,Mark it on your phone bud?
948212,kickingfrog,2015-12-06 20:56:00,8333,Useful as long as the same phone is still in my possession next year.
948220,wormdunker,2015-12-06 22:31:00,1711,"I'll remind you guys next year at this time, providing someone reminds me to remind you!  LOL!"
948277,BillM,2015-12-07 17:21:00,17367,"Useful as long as the same phone is still in my possession next year.  Google Calendar, then it doesn't matter what phone you're using at the time."
