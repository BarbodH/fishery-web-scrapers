948544,FLEX ROD,2015-12-09 14:28:00,394,"Help please, I have a chunk of ground Moose meat that looks great, not too much fat but enough that it wont be dry so I am looking for some suggestions on how to cook it.  In the past I have done meatballs from Venison, marinated in Rum and OJ with ground up Plums and Pears but I am open to suggestions as I would like to do something different.  It will be cooked on Saturday, so please share some of your secret or not so secret recipes.  Please.....  Thank you,  FLEX"
948547,dave524,2015-12-09 15:06:00,4508,Did most of my ground venison as a meatloaf. I would imagine it is a good choice for moose as well
948555,Joeytier,2015-12-09 16:36:00,3990,Last time I had moose ground I made burgers.  Absolutely fantastic 70/30 moose with some ground pork
948559,misfish,2015-12-09 16:54:00,29133,"You could even fry up some fat back,pour the remains in the meat and mix. For burgers or loaf. I would go with burgers myself. Chile works to."
948570,bare foot wader,2015-12-09 19:31:00,1354,"burgers, meat loaf, nachos/tacos, meat balls, pasta/lasagna, shepherds pie, meat pie, chilli/sloppy joes...all stuff I've done with my moose....how much ground? how many people you feeding?"
948573,Fang,2015-12-09 20:17:00,1330,About half my moose ground was getting used up making jerky. I bought the high mountain kit from princess auto and did it in my oven. Did one pack (1-1.5 lb) at a time and it never lasted any more than a day or so around my house.  not the best if your on a low salt diet  cracked pepper and bourbon bbq was my favorite
948585,FLEX ROD,2015-12-09 21:23:00,394,"Thank you folks, I was thinking meat balls in a mushroom sauce, over fresh home pasta or the easy way rice.  But I may now split it and do a meatloaf also.  Thanks, FLEX"

Thats some nice taste.

Art  anything you can do with ground beef, you can do ground moose, or any wild game for that matter   I want to taste the game. Why I never made speggitti sauce with mine. You just hide the real taste."
948615,adempsey,2015-12-10 00:24:00,1498,"Some fancy burger places put butter into the ground beef.   So, just add some fat to it."

948651,Mister G,2015-12-10 12:27:00,1429,"anything you can do with ground beef, you can do ground moose, or any wild game for that matter Yes, this is true. However, it will not taste the same because of how LEAN most wild game meat is compared to ground beef.  For venison or moose I treat it the same and use the ground meat without adding and pork or other foreign meat to it. But I do NOT use ground venison/moose for hamburgers because of how dry and sometime gammie it can taste.  So I use it to make meatballs, chili, tacos and nachos with it and no one knows the difference.  I have made meatloaf with it, but wasn't overall satisfied with it because it was extremely dry."
