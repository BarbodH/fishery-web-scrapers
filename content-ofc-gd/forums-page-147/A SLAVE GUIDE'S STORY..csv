My name for the truck tire type is splinter. A small thing that gets under the skin and causes aggravation way beyond its true size. Eventually the poison they produce results in their rejection by the larger body. I suspect that Tyler  is one young man who will be telling Moosebunk stories around the campfire for a long time. Sharing and giving freely for other's enjoyment produces satisfactions unequaled through other activities. Good job - in more than one way. I am curious did the 47 hold up ?"

I'm wondering if this one deposit found on Slave was crushed flat by the building weight of glacial ice?  http://www.fossilmuseum.net/Tree_of_Life/Stromatolites.htm  Great report Drew!!!  Your story brought back memories of my rookie year on the Bear back in the summer of '95. Good times!!!  It's rare you'll chime in Dave, but I kinda had a feeling this report would hit home with you.   I will say, being a rookie it's understood that I would sit out before others, and Bob was actually great and accommodating to this as best he could be.  That I am thankful for.  And it's understood that I would have to learn the ropes and need the right direction to get things done, maybe working harder in the process to keep up too.  Luckily there were many guides along the way that helped with that in a friendly manner...  What's remains a question still, is that in a place I would consider paradise, all guides ""choosing"" to be there to work and guide, attending to happy guests who are hoping to enjoy some of the best times of their lives, and each day all of us being permitted to share, create and enjoy those experiences together, that, someone, anyone, would want to be miserable, or insulting, or pushy, intolerable, rude, or anything else negative for that matter.  If being there makes one be like that, or if that's the way one simply wants to be, then to me it would seem they're not in it for any decent reason.  Although I was kindá hoping Truck Tire would have had a medical emergency and as a result have to express gratitude to you.  He has friends there.  His reasons he chose not to be one with me and I'm fine with that.  With Plummer's Lodge being on my bucket list, I really appreciated your report and pictures Bunk. I too appreciated that your report included all aspects of being a rookie guide at Plummer's. Thanks for sharing your experiences with us.  Would love to see ya get there Tom.  If there and you wanted, I'd guide you in a heartbeat too.  It always takes me about 2 or 3 days before I can bring myself to read your posts….lol…my instant reaction is one of insane jealousy  You have to invite me up there by the way.  love the pic of the kid struggling to cradle that beast!  Thanks Simon.  You're invited!!!  Tyler was a champ by the end of the week, knock-out blow after K.O. he must have reeled in a hundred fish or more that week.  Sounds like a crazy experience. Way more interesting than just going to Plummer's as a guest.  My blood pressure was going up a bit reading about the snide remarks, jabs and butt holes. It rubbed me the wrong way, guys talking to Bunk like that.  Your blood pressure Chris... no way man,.?  You're cool as a cucumber dood.  Thanks for looking out though.  Guest or guide, both awesome memories either way.  What the hell do those lakers eat to get so fat?  Drifter nailed it.  Saw a couple big fish eyeballing from below, the struggles smaller lakers would have coming in on the line.  Looking up at 'em like a hungry dog at the dinner table.  Sharing and giving freely for other's enjoyment produces satisfactions unequaled through other activities. Good job - in more than one way. I am curious did the 47 hold up ?  Not sure what was caught after leaving?  There was another 50'ish pounder caught.  Real long and muscular looking, not as short and slobby as The Viking's laker.  Quality to be had from all the guides though.  The number of 20 to 40 pounders caught weekly is incredible."

We have a way to deal with people like that Bunk. All you will need is a 5 gallon pail filled with sand. When you're in camp and Truck Tire and his roomies aren't, dump the sand in TT's bed. Make sure it's nicely spread out under the covers. It will get the point across without having to duke it out usually.  You still may have to knock him on his    but there is no reason to put up with bull from some twat that shouldn't be there in the first place. It's obviously become a job for him and is no longer a passion.  I gave up guiding because of this. When it stops being what you live for it's time to give it up. Took me 25 years before it became work so I had a pretty good run.  Now I just want to fish for myself and my friends. Going to head to Bear probably in 2017 to fish with one of my guide buddies at the main camp. We're going to head out for a week of fishin', campin' and drinkin' near Bloody River."

We're going to head out for a week of fishin', campin' and drinkin' near Bloody River.  Some good suggestions Dave in the rest of it.  And totally understand just keeping fishing for yourself and friends, plenty do.  Will likely want a revisit to Bear at some point as well, but through the lodge it would likely be Trophy Lodge.  With Branson's (or maybe it's Arctic Cirlce) opened up again, and the self-guided plan, that'd be great too.  To book it though, thinking you'd need a couple years in advance and a solid group of eight or more anglers.  Big fish caught there as you probably already know.  Heading out and camping at the Bloody, that would be something else as well.  Would like it for the lakers sure, but some shore grayling and maybe on the fly would be cool too.   I found it weird.

Agree with the above statement too, but with me, it's not age (or shouldn't be age) dependent in the least.  We can all be grumps in the making some days, and always keeping the negatives in check is impossible.  But again, in that place there's just no need to take it beyond with that ""schoolyard"" stuff as you put it.  By the responses to the post, I'm actually glad to have kept it in the report.  It did add something different, some real food for thought.  It makes all that good fishing and stuff, that much better too.   That was a great read........my next trip to Yellowknife will be to Plummers, with you as my guide !!!!!!!! what a awesome experience. Thanks for putting that together.........  :worthy:  Hey!  Just ask them if the guide's available when you call 'em to book.  If he is, he's yours.   Appreciate all the kind replies guys.

Spent most of my time guiding out of Trophy, but have guided @ the main lodge and Neiland Bay. Have also been to Bransons and Arctic Circle lodges.  I first fish Bloody with an old guide friend years ago. We had the day off @ the lodge so we boated the 30 miles and spent 1/2 day fishing shallow lakers in August. Between the two of us we caught close to 2 dozen fish all between 20-25#'s in about 4 hours fishing. Camping out there for a week we are bound to hit a 50 or two with a little luck."

Been without internet for a few weeks while in Nunavut on a contract.  Everything blocked at the new job except work related crap.  Monthly fee is pricey so held out as long as possible before hooking up to this slower service.  Gave me time to work on this report, explore some tundra and watch some T.V., but most of the time it's just work.  Begging to get some ice fishing in, the weather has not been too co-operative and I don't have an auger for the two to three feet of ice already on the lakes and ocean.  Have taken a walk out on the Arctic Ocean though, nabbed some photos, and been hoping to capture shots of the little arctic foxes that group up around the residence I'm in.  Pretty cool (actually cold) experience, and not much daylight.  After being up for only 14 minutes, the sun goes down on me December 1st and it doesn't come back up ti'll January 13th here.

946722,Headhunter,2015-11-27 15:22:00,5703,Awesome Drew! Best hour I have spent in a long time... thanks so much for putting it up here! HH
946723,Moosebunk,2015-11-27 15:27:00,3970,"Buddy, for me at least, that was by far the best story you've ever published online. I loved it!!  The juvenile Bull you endured was interesting as well. Surprising as I wouldn't expect Plummer's would ever put up with that kind of crap. You're a better man than me, I'd have lasted about 5 minutes before going postal LOL!   I felt like i went on 3 guided trips with you bunk, i cant figure out if you are a better writer or angler but assuredly you are a master of both. I also find myself amazed at your restraint in dealing with the big bully, a lesson for guys like me who probably would have had an altercation with him at some point, which would only have soured your adventure. Maybe one day i can get you to guide me somewhere, i think any trip with you would be the adventure of a lifetime! Good read as always bud, thanks for getting my blood going!   Just an amazing read and story in general. Thanks for taking the time to write that up.  Man I wish you would have drilled truck tire lol. I have no time for people like that.  Because of race and profession I've been called plenty names, dealt with crisis and extremes in peoples emotions, and been hit, kicked, bit, burned, stabbed and spit on too.  Many times over.  Mental illness, alcohol and addictions, racism, ignorance, etc.,  And in just recent years I've had plenty slander thrown my way by thugs and bullies as well.  You have to ""think"" through those kind of challenges, and having restraint is the first step in being able to do that. It's a part of the story yes, but overall it's a small part part of this story.  Maybe I should have left it out of this report?  Maybe, but I don't think so.  As Jimmer says below too, the pictures do tell a whole lot more.  You know you're a very lucky dude, right? The pictures alone, tell the story!  ""Very!""  Thanks dood.  I'm at work, that just took my entire coffee break (and then some) to read. Great report Bunk. On this crappy, rainy Friday morning for 45 mins I felt like I was catching monster Lakers way up north. Congrats on your successful guiding experience at Plummer's.  Thanks.  It was a success, agreed.  Wow, amazing, I can't imagine how long that put together but I thoroughly enjoyed reading it for the last hour. That 47 was a slob.  Isn't it?  Maybe the slobbiest fish I have ever seen, but definitely the slobbiest and biggest from Slave.  Thanks guys."
946730,Guidofisherman,2015-11-27 16:04:00,206,"Wow, that was a two coffee read. Very interesting story about a guide's life. Your medical skills sure came in handy. I'll tell you my similar experience on a canoe trip sometime over a ""wobbly pop"". It never fails to disappoint me how bullies are allowed to operate. My compliments for taking the high road. Great photos by the way. Any explanation on how the round circles on the rocks were formed?"
946732,fishindevil,2015-11-27 16:12:00,6254,insane report drew !!!! the best one yet....its just incredible.....you are the man...  :worthy:
946741,DRIFTER_016,2015-11-27 16:59:00,10439,"Great report Drew!!! Now you know what us Plummers guides have to deal with. Most of the crap that happens is due to that one or two Richards in camp and not the guests. Over the 15 years I guided on Bear I had my share of run ins with guides like Truck Tire and believe it or not most were Plummers rookies although not guiding rookies who thought they were all that and treated guides who had been there much longer than them like they were idiots and morons. Luckily these ""professionals"" generally only lasted a season if that. The one in question didn't make it through the first month before being put on a plane South on his own dime. But guide long enough and you will run into guests lake that too.  I haven't guided in quite a while now and every once in a while I miss the enjoyment of being in the bush for a couple of months. I can tell you I do not miss those giant celebrity shore lunches though. They always take too long and cut into the fishing time.  Rookie guides always get the short end of the stick. They are the first ones to be shore bound when there is a lack of guests and they get all the menial tasks that the ""experienced"" guides are too good to do. In my rookie year I got to insulate the roof of the lodge on Smith Arm of Great Bear. Nothing like crawling around a 100* attic installing crap loads of fiberglass insulation!!!  Your story brought back memories of my rookie year on the Bear back in the summer of '95. Good times!!!"
