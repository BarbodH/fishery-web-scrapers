947642,John Bacon,2015-12-03 03:33:00,3277,Great if it works.  I have never seen someone use that many crank baits for ice fishing though.  http://www.scout.com/outdoors/wired2fish/story/1618325-how-to-store-crankbaits-snag-free
947667,muddler,2015-12-03 12:35:00,623,"Genius! Simple, cheap(free) and effective. Now why didn't I think of that?  Thanks!  muddler"
947697,Headhunter,2015-12-03 16:30:00,5703,That's a neat idea! I think I'll wait for the Rapala Jar and elastic combo to hit my local CTC! LOL HH
948077,dave524,2015-12-05 10:56:00,4508,"They are all lipless baits for more vertical fishing, wonder if it works with lipped baits as well ?"
948080,spincast,2015-12-05 12:22:00,3279,cool idea for a fly in
948081,manitoubass2,2015-12-05 12:33:00,11391,Yea it does  Been doing it for years but i still store in plano boxes
948100,mike rousseau,2015-12-05 15:06:00,4661,And if you want one in the bottom you get to dump the entire container out to get it...
948101,manitoubass2,2015-12-05 15:11:00,11391,Thats why I still use plano boxes lol
948104,SirCranksalot,2015-12-05 15:45:00,3291,But the idea of using elastic bands still will work on plano boxes.
948126,wormdunker,2015-12-05 20:54:00,1711,Great idea!  Now what am I going to do with all those trays I purchased?  Garage sale?
948323,cram,2015-12-07 21:43:00,1733,Guess that dude likes ice fishing with rattle baits!  Holy cow.
948325,Kerry,2015-12-07 22:03:00,383,Just remember to replace those rubber bands periodically.Once they get dried out and hard its a pain on lures that don't rarely get used or only get used seasonally. Kerry
