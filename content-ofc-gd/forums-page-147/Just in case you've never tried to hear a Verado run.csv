948419,67ZL1,2015-12-08 05:59:00,51,
948420,mike rousseau,2015-12-08 06:12:00,4661,Ooohhhh baby.....  Nice ride...
948137,irishfield,2015-12-05 22:31:00,26272,"275 Hp Verado at 4.5mph trolling for musky. See if you can hear it over the water pump pee noise and water gurgle. Beauty day out there for Dec 5th, only thing that could have made it better would have been a big gal. Oh well, thanks for the day Terry!   "
948139,MCTFisher9120,2015-12-05 22:45:00,3761,Looks awesome out there and the Verado sure is a quiet beast.
948142,ketchenany,2015-12-05 22:57:00,3229,"The pee hole must have been dirty, didn't see him in the vid  Nice looking day."
948143,irishfield,2015-12-05 23:03:00,26272,
948148,Terry,2015-12-05 23:24:00,14456,"nice day on the water, Dec.5  doesn't get much better"
948153,Sinker,2015-12-06 00:08:00,8692,"I usually slow down this time of year. Thats pretty fast, no?  S."
948154,irishfield,2015-12-06 00:10:00,26272,"Point A to B in 100 FOW, if they're cruising there they'll hit. 3 to 3.5 mph otherwise trolling structure. Water is still warm at 43F !!!"
948162,chris.brock,2015-12-06 01:07:00,4053,"Holy crap, I'm jealous of you guys being out in early December with weather like that and with the shot at a giant.  To heck with the ice, that looks way more fun."
948165,Crazy Ivan,2015-12-06 01:49:00,184,Nice day!  Honey Harbour?
948166,irishfield,2015-12-06 01:56:00,26272,"Well North of Honey Harbour, but the general area."
948168,Crazy Ivan,2015-12-06 02:14:00,184,"Beautiful there, why did I winterize my boat in November?"
948172,Garnet,2015-12-06 03:52:00,2056,I was in a bass tournament on Lake scugog. I spent 20 minutes hold Fish TV Leo and Ron's Verado talking mostly to Ronnie. Finally time to go Leo put the Verado in gear.  It had been running the whole time.
948173,Steelheadphycho,2015-12-06 03:55:00,470,Aaaaahhhhhhh sweet music.   What a beautiful day. Lucky you!
948174,mike rousseau,2015-12-06 03:55:00,4661,I gotta ask...  Why would you not be using your kicker...?  Is it just there for safety?
948176,misfish,2015-12-06 04:13:00,29133,"How strange is this. My old boss was at the crhistmas party tonight and said he seen guys trolling musky in deep waters. I,ll bet you two were one of them.  He could see ya,ll from his front window. Beauty day to be out for sure."
948178,irishfield,2015-12-06 04:28:00,26272,"Why would I want to listen to the kicker clacking away Mike? The Verado burns 0.5 US gallons / hour (2 litres/hr), trolling at 5 mph. The kicker would be using the same or more fuel, be at about 75% power to do 5mph with my boat, be noisy and have much less boat control than the center drive of the main engine and you also probably wouldn't hear the reel clickers pulling drag over the sound of the small engine at high power setting.  Now if you're just learning the water and aren't overly sure where the rocks are on your trolling path, when out on GBay, yes you definitely use your kicker as a sacrificial lamb until you know the water like the back of your hand.  Now if I was downrigging for Lakers at 1.6 mph, I'd be on the kicker or the electric trolling motor. The slowest the Verado will push the boat at 550 rpm idle is 2.8 mph"
948180,mike rousseau,2015-12-06 05:04:00,4661,Wouldn't have thought a big motor like tgat would get better milage then a kicker  Speaks strongly about the motor
948181,irishfield,2015-12-06 05:10:00,26272,Even if it didn't I'd still be running it for the silence alone! A full 7.5 hour day of Musky trolling for 15 litres of premium. Another 20 litres or so running back in from the end of the trolling run (about 1/2 an hour from the ramp at 35 mph) while burning 10.5 USgallon/hr. An entire day of fun for under 50 bucks... as long as you don't hit anything!!  or lose a $100 bait!
948190,mike rousseau,2015-12-06 13:47:00,4661,That's amazing!!!!  I burn 30-50$ a day with my 16' 50hp set up...  I do run around a lot though and troll 5mph most of the year...
948226,Sinker,2015-12-07 00:48:00,8692,Ive never had any luck trolling that fast this late. Seem to always get them going much slower. Like 2.5-3 ish.  S.
948250,Dara,2015-12-07 13:39:00,3052,I kinda like the sound of a Verado at 50 mph myself
948251,Dara,2015-12-07 13:41:00,3052,"I kinda like the sound of a Verado at 50 mph myself   PS, my buddy is selling a 2010 21' Lund with a 250 Verado if anybody is interested."
948262,irishfield,2015-12-07 15:15:00,26272,So do I Dara! Love it when powering it up onto plane and it sounds like it shifts gears when the Supercharger boost comes up.
948393,67ZL1,2015-12-08 03:29:00,51,Still can't figure out why Mercury refuses to offer the L6 Verado in a tiller.
948405,Moosebunk,2015-12-08 04:27:00,3970,"Your motor isn't even gear at 4.5mph.   Where the heck has that Terry been?   At -43 & -50C windchill this past weekend, this makes me just a wee bit jealous Wayner!"
