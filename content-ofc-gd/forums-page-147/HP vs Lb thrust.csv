I need to know what is the ration between 1Hp and 1Lb thrust How many Lb thrust is in 1Hp.  I understand in the past Johnson motors label the outboards in Lb thrust.  I know that the HP and Lb thrust are two different UM (unit measure). I am just looking for a raw estimate for ideal conditions. Thank you.  "

947165,Steve,2015-11-30 23:25:00,2075,"it is very complicated to try and compare (as the above thread suggests)  however, in basic practicality, to give you an idea, I have a 17' tiller lund boat with 50hp. Rig is about 1300lbs all said and done.  A 2hp outboard will push my boat faster (quite a bit faster actually) than my 80lbs 24v trolling motor ... whether I compare my 80lbs tiller mount tm or my bowmount 80lbs tm.  hope that helps a bit..."
