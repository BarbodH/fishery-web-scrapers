948497,solopaddler,2015-12-08 22:21:00,8605,"You will never find a ""how-to"" style article in this magazine, that's just not me. I just re- read this thread and noticed this statement.^^^ I think that this is an area that should be explored/explained to your readers. I typically don't purchase fishing magazines but when I do, this is the kind of information that I enjoy reading about. The destinations and stories are a great read and getaway for the reader. But these destinations are trips that I will never be able to afford. ( at least not anytime soon ) I don't mean exploiting and pushing product, but explaining tactics and techniques for catching trophy fish in trophy waters. maybe a section on what to bring ( ie lures , line , leaders ect... ) Just my 2 cents !  I realize I may lose some potential readers but I'm okay with that. How-to style articles will never have a place in the magazine for better or for worse. It will be devoted solely to highlighting interesting angling destinations from coast to coast. Not just 5 star destinations although they will have a place, because frankly people like to dream. But pretty much any fishery that's interesting or unique.  There will also be a healthy dose of more narrative style pieces, stories more than anything else. Also there'll be some interesting bio's on anglers - people who've spent a lifetime exploring the wilder areas of Canada. There's a whole lot of guys out there with a lot of interesting stories to tell!  This is the exact stuff I like to read which is why I'm doing this. My hope is there's enough other people out there who agree! I do know this is a concept that has never been explored before in a fishing magazine so I think it sets it apart. The other factor is this format is sommething that can be marketed quite successfully in the States as there's a WHOLE lot of U.S. anglers who enjoy coming to Canada to fish! How-to type formats are a dime a dozen and would be a much harder sell Stateside."

However I hope you never do away with your online reports. The pics and videos tell a huge part of the story and add big time!!

I'm thrilled to finally announce the launch of Canada Fishing Guide Magazine! This premier issue is available in digital format only, but going forward there are big plans. At some point in the new year information on how to subscribe will be released and going forward it will be available in both print and digital form.  For those who missed my earlier announcement the basic concept of the magazine will be to highlight interesting and unique angling destinations from coast to coast. Along with that there will be a good amount of more narrative pieces. Stories from some of the most gifted writers in the industry. It's exactly the stuff that I like to read and I'm hoping everyone else will too! You will never find a ""how-to"" style article in this magazine, that's just not me.  For members of this board you may be interested in knowing that Chris Brock's brother Colin will be a regular contributor with a piece called ""Chronicles Of Fish"". The man is both a natural born story teller and imo a diamond in the rough. He has a hugely entertaining story in this premier issue.  If I could I'd also love to tap into the great wealth of knowlege and experience that exists on this board. If ANYONE has a story they'd like to share drop me a line! Also if you do read this premier issue please message me at [email protected]  Going forward I'll be publishing letters from the readership and ANY comments or thoughts either positive or negative are appreciated and needed!  Now my question. As most of you know I've always published my stories online and I love doing it. The online stories are a completely different animal as you're telling a tale with photos and video. Much different from what might be published in print.Going forward I will continue to publish my online trip reports but I'm struggling mightily with whether I should wait until after the associated feature is published in the magazine.What I publish in the magazine will definitely be different, but I'm wondering whether people buying the magazine would feel cheated if an online version of my story had been floating around on the net for several months?Obviously there will be plenty of other writers contributing to the magazine so this question only applies to me.How do you guys feel, should I wait until after the magazine is published to post my online trip reports?Beyond that, here's the link for the magazine, hope you enjoy the read!  http://www.canadafishingguide.net/buy-online/        "

947866,woodenboater,2015-12-04 03:19:00,2277,"Definitely embargo your stories from online viewing for several months at least. I would also suggest only one from each issue. If too many free reports are out there, then subscribers might very well be ok with waiting a couple of months or whatever the embargo period is.  it might also mean posting only a few photos vs what you're doing now with your trip reports. Once it becomes a business, you need to make sure the paid subscribers are getting their money's worth and seeing paid content online might not make them happy.  Good luck and I'm sure you'll find the happy place where everyone is good."

A premier issue online would be a good gateway to that Mike.  See what it's all about.  Something to think over eh!  I agree with you 110% on your intended content.  The ""how-to's"" have been done to death for me in publications, and the product pushing. Understand why many would like them but, any magazine I do pick up off the shelf I most often look for the travel destination pieces.  Being a story teller, I like the escapism when being told or taken away on a story/trip.  That's why it's great we still have a few people around online willing to share their realism and experiences, outside of much commercialism.  Applaud the idea.  Like the direction.  You may not remember but yet you may, our conversation in a restaurant U.S. side one night back November 2009.  Told you about Petri Hiel (Kingfisher) Germany.  You've gone that direction somewhat yourself since then, and if you recall this, you'd know I envy your choices.  If you are serious about making the best profit you can, then it will be difficult to give things away for free, especially as you often do in the grand format here and elsewhere.  Your saving grace if you continue to do so, may just come from the culmination of all other contributors who do not do the same. Much like with OOD in your past I'd guess, a hold out for first rights in order to be the fresh current resource is to the publications benefit. I think you objected to this with OOD, but down the road the shoe may need be worn on the other foot.  Like I commented before too Mike... BIG BALLZ.  The time you put into work, fishing, fishing, fishing, travel, travel, planning, planning, planning, reporting, reporting and now this...???  Don't know how you do it and find time for sleep, let alone family.  But you obviously must, and, you've always been the type to give things you're passionate about their full attention, 200%.  So, I think if anyone can pull off a great launch and take this down some road of success, it's you man. You've put in the time and miles to prepare for it and it's gonna be interesting to watch the race.  Good luck Mike."
947882,adempsey,2015-12-04 05:11:00,1498,"IMO you have four options.  1) Only people who pay get the articles, both past and current.  To me, this might make the best business sense.  However, it's hard to know how many new subscribers you would get by offering something for free.  2) Publish abstracts of each article online for free.   Basically, a very short summary of the entire article.  This is what we do in science.    You get a basic summary of what the researchers did, but you have to pay to get the full article.  3) Publish ONE complete article for free near when the issue launches or shortly thereafter, I'd say 2 weeks max.    Hopefully this will draw business.  4) Similar to three, but publish ONE complete article from the archive for free instead of a new article.  I wouldn't publish any of the older content online for free because access to archive issues is also something to sell.    Unless, it's for advertising as per number four.  Of course, ultimately, this all depends on how you plan to attract new customers.   This is a business now and you have to treat it as such, otherwise, why bother doing it?  Best of luck!"

I just read this news and just wanted to echo what many on the board have already said. Congratulations !!!! .......     it couldn't have happened to a more deserving  guy. When I first started reading your reports and stories here many years ago I always thought you should be publishing your articles but I am sure its a very tough business to get into and this just shows that your hard work and perseverance to achieve your dream can come true.  I much prefer reading fishing tales and reports rather than ""how to's"" and think from a business standpoint you should hold off on your online report until its published on your mag ... just my 2 cents  Anyways congrats again and all the best my friend !"

However, you are now doing this, I think, as a livelihood. As such, you should focus on maximizing your business potential.  Me...I will gladly be a paid subscriber.  Just my 2 cents."

Don't remember you telling me anything about Petri Hiel, but I'm curious now. I can't remember what I had for breakfast yesterday so that's not too surprising LOL! FWIW I didn't object to the same issue with OOD at all. There's a related issue that I did have a problem with though. No regrets whatsoever about cutting ties with them, that was the impetus I needed to do this. There are very few people who can understand what my life is like and you are one of the few.

Interesting perspective Adam thank you!! One thing that I know for sure, the online trip reports will be published online regardless just as they always have been. I was only trying to get a feel whether people might have an issue with the reports being posted before the associated feature in the mag. It seem pretty clear that they'll be published online afterwards.  Congrats, looks great!  I would save the goods for your paid subscribers.  Good luck! Thank you sir!
