Ice fishing late January and Feburary, great success on the creek this spring with the Rainbow’s. Walleye wasn’t amazing but the two times I got invited out by my friend Glenn we caught some fish and had awesome weather to do it in.  Bass opener soon followed then one two week camping trip and a 6 night trip in September. All in all I can’t complain too much I got to fish lot’s and enjoy my summer. Didn’t break any PB’s this year except a big trout but aside from that I sucked. Didn’t catch any 5lb+ smallies on the inland lakes I stay at. Largemouth this year were bigger on average but no giant’s, some nice low to high 4lbr’s breaking 5lbs once. Maybe next year well break the PB Largemouth and find that 7lb’r I’ve been searching for.  With my last trip out back in September fall has been slow just working and picking up things for the boat project next spring. We finally got away from the rental so should be able to fish a extra week or two next summer. Rental’s are expensive so the 14’ deep and wide open floor style boat I picked up will be perfect for the smaller lakes. On with some pictures now!   First trip out for 2015 was Rice Lake Ice Fishing. We mainly were after a few cold beers and some good food from Rhino’s but got out on the ice for a few hours managed to catch a little over a dozen Perch and Sunfish. Was a good “ice breaker” after many weeks of cold and snow.   Back to basics, no wind so had all I needed lol.   Decent Perch   Got out on Lake Simcoe for 2 trips out with a hut rental operator. Caught lot’s and had to bring lunch and tackle was awesome!   Clean fish always a nice treat    Trout opener soon followed. I was surprised this year how busy the creek was, decided to wait until the first weeks in May, less fish but no crowd and could actually enjoy a hour or 2 down there tossing small spinners and crankbaits into the pool’s. Here are a few pictures from my trips out.   Dozen’s of these guys, fun fish   New PB, no scale or tape I would guess 7-8lbs the fight was intense on the 6’6 Light Fast Spinning Rod. I did good work keeping the fish on deffinately test’s the “light” equiptment.   And another   Beauty little trout love this shot   Walleye then opened up next. My first of the year haha dink from Rice Lake always happy to catch a couple there.  Another day another pair to take home  2015 Lineup ready for war with bass season around the corner, lineup always changes have added another rod and reel I think since then    Bass opener wasn’t great. I got out with another friend of mine on Clear Lake for the day. We caught dozen’s of bass many small smallmouth and a few walleye also that day. I hooked up with the 2 only decent bass that day. After so much open water and rock I convinced my friend to steer the boat into a backbay that was shallow. Not a 10 minutes in I hooked up with a nice chunky largemouth. Made my day had me wanting to be on my home waters in Eastern Ontario right at that moment love slop and heavy cover.       Next trip was first 2 weeks of August. Lot’s of pictures I choose some of the better pics. First of the trip, morning fish on the jerkbait out deep   Not many frog fish this year but here was a pair     My papa came with us on this trip. This was his first bass and ended up being the biggest of the trip. Went 5lbs 9oz and is his new PB. Life took us apart for 6 or 7 years so now that things are good again I expect to take more trips with my Papa, Dad and Uncle in the future. Still mad he beat me haha not next year! Very thankful he brought me into fishing when I was very young.   Every morning I love throwing the popper around. Didn’t produce any size this year. Caught lot’s of nice bass like this one but no piggy’s this year.   Lot’s of these 2-3lb class fish on the plastics and jigs. They sure do love that 3.5” TRJ   Big fish from pads close to deep water. Love that new Aldebaran 50HG incredable reel very strong.   Every summer I tangle with a few of these here was the biggest of the trip   Swim Jig’s were a important addition to my techniques this year caught big fish and lot’s of them. Good for covering vast weedy areas, I used this on outside edges and when going from slop bed to slop bed anywhere I could, even sinking it deep and fishing it like a crankbait worked well on tougher days.     More Largies from the deep on jerkbaits   Few smallies too finally showed up     Got off shore this year learning to visually follow weedlines, flipping a jig down them worked in the afternoons pretty good got to expand on this more next summer          My dad and I wanted to start a tradition with my uncle and friend out where we go fishing. So here was the deal. 2 boats Dad and I vs the other two guys(locals). We did cooler’s with running bilge pump’s(Home made livewells) and went for a 4 fish limit. We set out at 5am and had until 11am so 5 hours made for a quick derby. Dad and I only boated 6 fish that morning I think with 2 in the well. We won and took bragging right’s for the summer with 8lbs 10oz the other guys had 4 fish for 7lbs 10oz haha. Nobody caught a kicker and we had basically 3 2lbr’s with one bass around 3lbs. Can’t wait to do it again always fun a little competition   Last round was my trip I took back in September. We went for the last 6 days and it was fun. Fish were biting and I did pretty good.  First  morning, cold but got a nice smallie to come up and crush the spinnerbait   Another spot another Smallmouth   Only got 1 bass from slop this trip was nice to get one pitching the plastic around   Back to my friend, the Jig   Big fish of the trip     Spinnerbait bite was strong, was happy to come across it     After the rain   And another    Last outing for me was a fun one. After a tough 1 bite morning I was mad at the fish. I went out solo after breakfast until 3 or 4 that afternoon. Burning a spinnerbait on some weedlines produced nothing but Pike, did the jig in the same spots and came up empty. Abandoned my gameplan and went shallow and to a channel where there might of been warmer water. Sure enough I found decent slop and dead weed in the channel so we got onto a stretch of maybe 3 or 4 bites in a hundred yards. These 2 were nice so they got seats in the livewell. Made me happy and I turned a terrible day into a good day, was nice to put pressure on yourself and when you can be successful it all becomes worth it.    https://youtu.be/c4qaz8wZzDg  This summer I got a GoPro so am just starting editing and making little clips. Here was one I put together from my trip in September. Can’t wait to do more of this next year, thanks for reading and viewing all the pictures everybody! Be safe this winter and good luck to everybody in 2016   MTBF"

Great clip, perfect morning eh was casting a spinnerbait all morning catching one every 15 minutes or so was slow and steady won't forget that September warm beautiful conditions.  Wow Mike really nice collection of bass there. Lots of quality fish and great pics. Can't wait to see you crack that 7, it's gonna happen sooner or later!  Pete I fear for me heart when that moment happens. I'll be in disbelief and it will be when I least expect it...probably on a frog boat side or maybe on a popper at 5am like the current PB. You never know that's what I love the hunt and anticipation.   Looks good Mikey ! Was a fun year!"
947872,Ron,2015-12-04 03:40:00,1683,Very impressive Mike.  Looks like you had a great season.  My year was a total bust. Bruised a couple of ribs and tore the ligaments in my shoulder.

947881,Moosebunk,2015-12-04 05:04:00,3970,"My two times faster than dial up is killing this report Mike...  But it appears as though you've got the largies dialed right in.  Like the steelhead the best but hey, it's all good dood!  Great season.  Good luck in the 2016"
948014,glen,2015-12-04 23:17:00,2641,Same old same old.  Bass fisher kicks butt again.   No wonder no one else is getting any you got them all.  Great pics.  Get them again next year.

948052,MCTFisher9120,2015-12-05 01:46:00,3761,"Very impressive Mike.  Looks like you had a great season.  My year was a total bust. Bruised a couple of ribs and tore the ligaments in my shoulder. Not good!!! That sucks, always worry about getting hurt and not being able to fish. Get better Ron Ice Fishing will be here soon drop by the store sometime!   You catch a lot of nice fish! I have my times, some days are great others are better!  If there's one guy I want to fish with on this site its you dude.  You live up your your name.  Well done Thank you man! I have fished with a couple guys on here hard to find the time with the ""family style"" trips I take each summer. Thanks for the reply!  My two times faster than dial up is killing this report Mike...  But it appears as though you've got the largies dialed right in.  Like the steelhead the best but hey, it's all good dood!  Great season.  Good luck in the 2016 I've been there slow computer sucks sometimes. Steelhead are a blast I love the fight reminds me of finessing smallies so always a good practice for bass season.   Same old same old. Bass fisher kicks butt again. No wonder no one else is getting any you got them all. Great pics. Get them again next year. lol thanks man! Want to explore deeper water largemouth some more. The deep weediness caught my eye this year. Liking the fact that I'm learning to be very versatile with the techniques. Neeeeoiiiice!  Always love your recaps dood!!!  Looks like another great year  Miigwich  Oh I should add I love that smile man! Speaks volumes on your attitude/appreciation of angling!  Fishing is my passion that's for sure. No other hobby's or things that take up my time. When my time is done at the shop i'll quite often turn on WFN or do some reading to learn more for the next season...the fishing train of thought never shuts off. I said 6 years ago I should learn a new technique every year and I have. It's amazing how many techniques I feel fully confident with now, continuing to learn and expand on what you know is why I love fishing. 5 years ago all I did was throw a frog, I caught fish but many hours went by some days with no bites...so then I learned to flip, throw a swim jig to cover vast areas of sparse weed...deep cranking, smallies on a jerk bait it never stops...I think that is a important part of fishing, the endless ways to find and catch the darn things.  Long story short thanks for the reply haha! More smiles for 2016 wait until we break 7lbs...the look on my face will be priceless    Thanks for the comments guys! Always nice to read what some people think of the pictures and write up.  MTBF"
