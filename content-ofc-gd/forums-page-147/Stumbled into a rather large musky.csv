948649,Mister G,2015-12-10 12:09:00,1429,"WOW, nice muskies Mike... Your da MUSKY man ! ! !  That area your fishing sure beats the bajesus out of trolling GB around in circles for 60+ hours hoping for one strike. Hope to get up to your waters next year so leave a few for me OK..."
947885,mike rousseau,2015-12-04 05:37:00,4661,"We were Lindy Riggin some big fall walleye the other day with minnows... Dad put his rod down to open another cold beverage... When he turned back around his rod was going over the side of the boat... With cat like reflexes he grabbed it just in time and wouldn't you know it there was his new PB musky on the end of the line...  No tape in the boat and didn't wanna do a vertical weigh on the boga grip so we will never know how big she ""officially"" was but it's probably the heaviest musky I've seen caught in person...    Mike"

947930,KraTToR,2015-12-04 14:52:00,506,"so who said you need big baits to catch big Muskie???  Very nice fish, dad's straining under the weight..lol"

947948,Rizzo,2015-12-04 16:26:00,4754,Wow that's a beauty. I should take your dad out...I often stumble into some rather large walleye while musky fishing
947952,manitoubass2,2015-12-04 16:53:00,11391,Awesome!!!  Also shows youdont need 100lb braid to land a HYYUGE fish!
947967,bigbuck,2015-12-04 18:30:00,2449,"NICE ski!!!! No, you do not need 100lb braid to bring one in BUT you put the fish under a lot of stress to bring it in with lighter tackle. Much bigger chance of killing a trophy."
947968,manitoubass2,2015-12-04 18:43:00,11391,Of course!
947999,misfish,2015-12-04 21:24:00,29133,Lucky dad.  Nice fish
