They have a family cottage on Healy Lake near Mactier. But didn't plan on trying to fish it this winter, because they don't have snowmobiles and have never been up in the winter before.  They don't fish much in the summer, and have very minimal fishing knowledge.  I feel like I should help these guys out.  And I thought it would be cool to take them to their home Lake and try to catch some fish.  I've heard there's Crappie in Healy.  But I was wondering what else is in the lake, and if it's worth runing up this winter.  If im going to take these guys out, I want some good action.  I can take them for perch on Simcoe and have a blast.  But if it's worth the drive, Healy would be a really fun time for them.  Anyone fish it recently?  I'd love some feedback."

Check Natural Resourses site and search for it.  hope this helps.  Don't go and spend thousands on equipment, they may not like it, just sayin.  Let me know of you need info on the lake, If it was published I have published copies 2005 -2008. They don't change at all, just away of spending money LOL.  Good Luck if tou go."
