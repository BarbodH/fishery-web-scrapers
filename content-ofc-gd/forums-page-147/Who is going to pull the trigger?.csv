946880,Dutch01,2015-11-28 04:52:00,1431,I've said my piece. I'm comfortable with how we each come off looking in this post.
946881,Dutch01,2015-11-28 04:54:00,1431,Exactly.

946889,Big Cliff,2015-11-28 11:11:00,6899,"Along with attending a summit in Paris with a delegation of 100 trough swines the Lieberals have announced to allocate another 2.6 Billion to developing countries. To other countries in order to develop energy infrastructure? For what? So they can put more people to work offshore,  manufacturing more products we wont be making? This Kids' been in office just over a month and has already earmarked 4 Billion dollars to Non Canadians. Makes me feel so compassionate, inclusive, patriotic you have no idea. And I'm bashed for making it a left/right argument. After experiencing the poor excuse we called governance in Ontario for the last decade how could I not?  I'd like to thank once again the chuckleheaded  Lieberal voter. It's wonderful to watch all these billions of dollars being pledged to helping other countries and other people! What about helping  the 31 first nations communities right here in Canada that don't even have safe drinking water? That's right, 10% of our First Nations communities are under ""boil water advisories"" and have been for years but we can spend all this money to provide clean drinking water to some other country?"
946891,Canuck2fan,2015-11-28 12:25:00,1444,"Interesting Dutch, here we had a decision by our Supreme Court ( Citizens United ) that ruled corporations are people too, and basically opened the flood gates to unlimited funding for political campaigns.  https://www.rt.com/usa/defense-contractors-department-government-170/  This might help to better explain the US defense spending?  Our method leaves room for a lot of games to be played!  If you want to read about the ways that military spending took off in the U.S. read the book Drift by Rachel Maddow. It illustrates just how and why military spending kept growing, growing, and has gone out of sight...  Ironically, it is at the point where it has become the single biggest security threat to the U.S. because it has all but crippled them financially with paying the interest on the money they borrowed to remain strong and free.  The most interesting point the book made to me though is that the out of control spending spending really started when neocons were able to blame rank and file personnel for having union type benefits... Totally exemplified how the loudest military supporters are ALWAYS the crappiest at looking after personnel financially when the are away fighting or come home after."

946925,Big Cliff,2015-11-28 19:46:00,6899," Cliff, the federal government gave $8.78 billion dollars to Aboriginal Affairs last year. The money is there, it's just not being managed well. And these are the same idiots that think they are qualified to manage our country are they not? Who is going to control where all these billions are actually going to be spent. Who is going to insure that the money is used to help those most in need and not used to support rebel groups? They can't even get it right here at home so now they are going to try to do it at arms length?    Bands with no water, but the chief making 200.000 may have something to do with it.  I might buy that in a couple of cases but I don't for a second believe that is the reason for most of it. How would you be feeling right now if you had to try to bring your children up in a situation where you couldn't even drink the water because it was so poluted, where in some cases it isn't even safe to bath in? Oh but wait, Canada, your home and native land thinks it is important to make sure that people in some foregin country should have safe drinking water."
946934,manitoubass2,2015-11-28 22:14:00,11391,"Most of that is propaganda. It has happened in a few cases with travel expenses etc added to salary and honorariums.

946935,Canuck2fan,2015-11-28 22:29:00,1444," It's not like a government to mis-manage our money....yeah, right  Anybody ever notice that once calculators got cheap in the mid 70's NOTHING any government did from the municipal level to the feds cost LESS than a million dollars.... Before that they had to work to stretch the numbers so large, after calculators it was just a matter of a few button presses. LOL.  After having dealt with guberments ordering meals, rooms and other things in the hospitality industry it isn't so much the politicians as the managing bureaucrats who never saw a dollar they had to borrow that they couldn't spend twice. If the maximum budget was 10 K for a retreat they would find a way to spend 14 K or more....  I have worked for a lot of BIG conservative party supporters who used to whine and chew about high taxes... Then on the other hand they would screw any government agent blind on pricing when it came to selling them something. I would say well you aren't helping lower taxes, when last week the exact same room and meal package for robonthejob corp was 89.99 per person per day. This week for the Department of Highways it was 129.50... roughly 33% more just because it was government.  If you think that was bad you should see what they charged any insurance company LOL. What was worse was at the time we were constantly doing government groups because we were the CHEAPEST they could find after shopping around and my boss was gouging them 30%. His excuse was EVERYBODY does it and if we were the cheapest the others sure were trying to.... He justified it by saying I want my share back after, I pay in so much is damned taxes....  Think of it like that across every department in every level for EVERY thing and you have the answer why government can't manage money. They are the single biggest customer of goods and services in the country and everybody who sells to them thinks it is an endless pot of money, and charges the accordingly.  In the case of the service we provided any manager in the government could go and show the finance department that they had called around and took the lowest price for the service... So when it goes up the food chain to the politician how would they know they weren't getting good value for the money? A bidding process occurred and they paid for the lowest bid..."

947701,JoePa,2015-12-03 16:55:00,179,Boy - all kind of theories and advise what to do - but let me tell you the truth - there is evil in this world - always was and always will be - if good people don't fight it then evil will win - and don't think for one minute think that by not confronting it you will be left alone and it won't come to harm you at some date -  The mess that now exists in the middle east and other places can be blamed on Obama and his liberal buddies who think somehow you can negotiate with evil - he has shown that he is not willing to fight evil and so it keeps getting stronger - if the U.S. maintained the strongest military force in the world and showed strong leadership no country would dare  stand up to it - but he has consistently shown that he doesn't want to stand up at times when he should - and others are taking advantage of this fact -  The Iraq war was a mistake because it eliminated balancing the power over in that region - Iraq and Iran were enemies and had fought a war - neither country was the dominate force in that region - with Iraq gone Iran is now controlling things there -  Our only hope is to throw the weak kneed liberals out of government and put a good leader ( like Reagan ) back in the driver's seat - otherwise all is lost - the world is too small a place today to ignore what is going on in different parts of the world - freedom and liberty have a price - one well worth fighting for - remember - if you give up your freedom for security - you will end up with neither -

946806,moxie,2015-11-27 22:04:00,1566,"Were you equally incensed when Harper padded the G8 bill by a couple hundred million so they could build gazebos and spend other bribe money in conservative won ridings? Did you come up with a cutsie name for them like you did with the Liberals? (I recommend contard). If not, you may be a hypocrite.  Harper was around long enough to know him from his track record. For me at least, Trudeau should get more than a cup of coffee in office before we judge.  Also, many posters here love to trot out how we need to ""stand by our commitments to our friends"" when it comes to sending Canadians into a war zone.  As a part of the OECD we made promises regarding international aid to our international partners, and Harper reneged on them. How come that's okay? Cause it was ""your boy""?  I'm not sure why the con love for sending Canadians boys to war, but we have no money to increase the peace in the world? For shame.  EDIT: you should know that the 100 ""swine"" you refer to are the Premier's of the provinces, who happen to come from all parties.  The same Premiers had been asking to meet with Harper for years, and he had no time for them. Some of them have since remarked how nice it is to have a PM who listens, and is inclusive and respectful to the Premiers. But I guess that doesn't matter because to you they are just swine.  EDIT: before I get slammed for being as anti Harper as you are anti Trudeau, let me state for the record I voted for Harper every election except this one. He had me and he lost me. I'm also very much against the poor job Wynne is doing. I am certainly not a liberal shill.         In fact I was incensed and would be regardless who governs and wish ""My boy"" would have excused himself from hosting and offered a better more viable and environmentally sustaining option.With the advancements that have been made in technology I would have preferred they have meetings via video conference. Nothing to build, no palms to grease and no security detail needed.  A waste of time, money and valuable resources.To hell with being a host to anything. This kid is flying 100 govt trough swines to a United Climate Change Conference and all that is involved with it from limos to linens. Ya, this kids a real thinker alright. Forget the cup of coffee but if he lets his urine settle in a glass he can actually drink it. Now thats self sustaining.  Track record? ""My Boy""  took the reigns during a global economic correction unlike the prosperous boom years Jeans' liberals lucked into.Even a Lib donkey couldn't screw that up. Money was literally falling from the heavens. I saw it myself.  I'm not 100 % sure but doubt I was ever comfortable to sending troops to a war that was absolutely someone elses responsibility but I would also support them without question.  Again, I guess ""My Boy"" didn't want to throw money away that almost never trickles down to those that need it. Ya. I'm ok with that.  They are from all parties but here again he could have distinguished himself from any other politician and he chose not to. Would it have been wrong to attend the conference with a handful of note takers and report to the premiers once he returned? Same ol' same ol'.  Stephen didn't want anything to do with Ontario and Quebecs' Premiers but couldn't well invite the rest without allowing the two whiniest to be there. Now in the kids they can all wear sparkle and paint on their faces, blow at pinwheels and live in an inclusive political world where even unicorns and butterflies fart gold dust.  ""Just Watch Me"" Isn't that what the kid said? I'm watchin' and the train I see leavin' the station looks just like the trains before it.  One last thing. Lieberal voters are still Chuckleheads."

Only individuals can make federal political donations.  And there are limits on how much an individual can donate.  They can, just not directly and openly.  They can promise board seats after retirement to politicians that vote their way on issues.  Campaign machines need products and services which can perhaps be offered pro bono, or at deeply discounted rates.  A newspaper could offer to provide favorable coverage in exchange for a favorable ruling later.  There are many ways to skin a cat.  And for the benefit of moxie I will pick on some Liberal this time  Jane Rounthwaite is married to Kathleen Wynne, and in 2012 at least, she owned 50% of a company called The Osborne Group of Toronto.  This company has done work for the ministries of children and youth services, community and social services, economic development and trade, finance, health and long-term care and revenue.  The Office of the Integrity Commissioner was asked about it, and said they cannot comment due to confidentiality requirements.  The relationship between this company and the Liberal party has at least the appearance of a conflict of interest. (source: http://www.torontosun.com/2013/02/10/wynnes-spouse-has-business-with-government)  Also appearing to be a conflict of interest is the cozy relationship between the Ontario Liberal Party and the Ontario English Catholic Teachers’ Association and Ontario Secondary School Teachers’ Federation.  They collectively have poured more than $6.5 million into the last three election campaigns, including $800,000 directly to the party, and millions more to pay for attack ads via Working Families. (source: http://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/national/education/teachers-union-payouts-an-investment-ontario-minister-says/article26983218/)  I've attacked Harper for attack ads here earlier, it's no more acceptable to me that Wynne does it.  In fact, it's even worse because it was done by an arms length agency that I don't think should be legal.  And to really push it over the top, the Ontario Liberals conveniently paid four unions $3.74-million since 2008 to help cover their ""costs during collective bargaining"".  This is blatant scam and it's the kind of thing I was alluding to when I referred to corporations and lobby groups.  I am certain it happens at the Federal level too, it just happens out of sight.  EDIT: I just found a great example (and it happens to be Liberal again)  Joe Volpe was a Liberal candidate who was found to have received $108,000 in contributions from 20 individuals that were all in some way connected to the top corporate executives of Apotex Pharmaceuticals. Each of the 20 individuals - which included 11-year-old twin boys and a 14-year-old boy - gave exactly $5,400, the maximum allowed at the time.

Here is quote from your second link, ""Corporations have been banned for donating to political parties in Canada since 2004""  The quote is not 100% accurate because the ban is for federal political parties.  I will acknowledge that there are ways for corporations to get money to politicians.  E.g. During the 2006 Liberal leadership race, Joe Volpe received donations from his employees children.  Because we know how many 12 years olds save up their allowance so they can donate to their daddy's boss's political compaigns.  But the corporations cannot make direct above the table legal donations to federal politicians or parties.  There will aways be favours such as job offers after retirement; but most of the money raised for the parties is done through lots of small donations."

Turns out theyve lied about this incident I don't think so, NATO has sided with Turkey and it looks like Turkey has proof and have covered their butts.

And listen to what turkey says, ""warned 10 times and violated airapace for 17 seconds)  That means the russians plane, if you do the math, was travelling at 255kmp/h  Russia says it received no warning.  And previously turkey has said violation of airspace is not an reason for immediate downing of a plane/jet.  ??????"
946612,irishfield,2015-11-26 18:34:00,26272,Hard to be warned with your radio off frequency.
946619,manitoubass2,2015-11-26 19:30:00,11391,Who said it was off?  And a typical warning without comminication is to fly beside said jet is it not?

946624,Dutch01,2015-11-26 20:04:00,1431,"As far as I can tell, the entire media machine seems to be challenged by reading comprehension.  The pilots did not warn every 1.7 seconds for 17 seconds at the exact same time the Russians flew at stall speed.  The transcript of just one warning takes almost 17 seconds to read.  Earlier reports indicate warnings took place over several minutes, starting on approach, prior to the planes entering Turkey.  One guy did the math wrong and now the entire internet is on a 17 second conspiracy theory.  Its actually a good example of groupthink overriding common sense."
946627,Dara,2015-11-26 20:20:00,3052,"My take on it...unless you were there, you will never know the truth.  Putin isn't bombing Turkey so he is just kinda mad but is somewhat to blame and other people know it so he isn't doing anything crazy.  Turkey dodged a bullet but they better be a bit more carefull next time"

The attacks in Paris give him a convenient excuse for missing the deadline.  But the reality is that he was never going to achieve those targets, nor do it for the costs that he had estimated.

To other countries in order to develop energy infrastructure? For what? So they can put more people to work offshore,  manufacturing more products we wont be making? This Kids' been in office just over a month and has already earmarked 4 Billion dollars to Non Canadians. Makes me feel so compassionate, inclusive, patriotic you have no idea. And I'm bashed for making it a left/right argument. After experiencing the poor excuse we called governance in Ontario for the last decade how could I not?  I'd like to thank once again the chuckleheaded  Lieberal voter."
946776,Dutch01,2015-11-27 20:10:00,1431," Harper was around long enough to know him from his track record. For me at least, Trudeau should get more than a cup of coffee in office before we judge.  Also, many posters here love to trot out how we need to ""stand by our commitments to our friends"" when it comes to sending Canadians into a war zone.  As a part of the OECD we made promises regarding international aid to our international partners, and Harper reneged on them.  How come that's okay? Cause it was ""your boy""?  I'm not sure why the con love for sending Canadians boys to war, but we have no money to increase the peace in the world? For shame.  EDIT: you should know that the 100 ""swine"" you refer to are the Premier's of the provinces, who happen to come from all parties.  The same Premiers had been asking to meet with Harper for years, and he had no time for them.  Some of them have since remarked how nice it is to have a PM who listens, and is inclusive and respectful to the Premiers.  But I guess that doesn't matter because to you they are just swine.  EDIT: before I get slammed for being as anti Harper as you are anti Trudeau, let me state for the record I voted for Harper every election except this one. He had me and he lost me.  I'm also very much against the poor job Wynne is doing. I am certainly not a liberal shill."

Having said that, say what you will about Trudeau or Harper, the fact is it's not one person deciding the fate of the nation. They are just figure heads for the party they belong to. Just a face/persona to represent the party. The bulk of the decisions are made by a group of senior party members with backing of the general party members. The figure head just regurgitates what his/her puppet masters tell him/her to."

I'm all for helping people when we can but two years ago when propane prices went through the roof I know Canadian seniors that had to choose between heating and eating. When I started calling our MPs and MPPs I was told to tell them to go to the United Way and they might be able to help because there was no provision in our government to help them.  There was a comment about ""why was I so bitter?"" I am bitter because I know seniors that have worked and contributed for their whole lives and the total sum of their pensions are $1370.00 a month but we can spend $60,000.00/ person to bring people here that have never contributed anything to Canada.

946072,woodenboater,2015-11-24 02:23:00,2277,"I heard Canada will now only take in Syrian refugees who are women, children or families. not single men.  Sounds like somebody is getting a little nervous about their promise.  I see this as a prioritization of who *really* needs our help so obviously women and children go to the head of the line. Families will include dads so it's not like men are being totally shut out. Just single men who probably aren't in need as much as others.  As well, CSIS and the RCMP have no problems with bringing in refugees other than how they'll be processed in a timely and secure manner."
946077,Canuck2fan,2015-11-24 02:46:00,1444,"While that sounds good in theory, it's what got us into this mess in the first place. The USA was so eager to arm Syrians against Assad, they ended up arming the people who became ISIS!  You are right about one thing though, It has to be people from the region that put boots on the ground if there is a ground assault. It has to be Muslim nations. Infidels marching on the caliphate is exactly what Islamic State wants.  That is a fair point about arming more people over there... it would also be playing into the hands of the military industrial complex.  The thing is the men in the those refugee camps should want to fight back given the chance. If they don't why should anybody?"
946078,manitoubass2,2015-11-24 02:52:00,11391,"They cant fight back.  The west has armed ISIS and al queda to the teeth, and funded them.  Vietnam was one thing but what do you use in the middle of the desert against rocket launchers and air cover?"

Thanks for the info.  As for their magazine, Dabiq, I've heard it is very slick and professional, and available in several languages. A small point of clarification though, it is only published online.  (The following is not directed at you DRIFTER, just a general comment)   I suppose it's different where I live than a lot of you guys ""up north"". I live in Markham, which as far as I know is the most multicultural city in Canada. There are things I don't like about it, mostly that I don't like big cities period. I'm not big on noise our crowds. I like the sound of the forest.  Anyways, when my Son moves out (years still to go), I'll be heading to the Kawarthas or further northeast most likely.  Anyways one thing I do love about it is how diverse it is.  I fish with lots of guys from Trinidad, Peru, China, etc. I can get amazing sushi, Shawarma, kabobs, you name it.  And I'll tell you what, there are some really pretty women here too. My Son has friends from all over the world, and he actually told me, unsolicited, that he was happy he lived in Markham or he wouldn't have met them.  It's his generation that I hope can fix the mess the world is in because I don't think ours will. These kids don't look around the classroom and see ""different"" people. They look around the classroom and see their own people - Canadians.  I say give them a chance to do it their way, we're not going to be around long enough to see how it turns out. It's their world now, we're just borrowing it."

We might be fighting this battle for our children/country if we like it or not.  My oldest is 14, youngest is 5. And its amazing to see that connection they have with the world.  I work with some somolians and libyans and its awesome! Some of the beat guys ive ever met! And wow can they cook!  Whats really cool is they ask me about aboriginal culture constantly. We have alot of fun with that. I give them a word a day and they lay tobacco every morning before work starts. Really really humble and awesome people."

And to those who believe that we should not be bombing, how would you feel if every male in your town was taken from their home and killed? That's what happened in Raqqa. The woman and girls were ""spared"", if you call slavery and such being spared. Is it not also part of the Canadian values that we don't allow mass genocide to go unheeded? These terrorists kill anyone that don't follow their strict doctorate. Do just let that keep happening? HH"

If Trudeau wasn't nervous about keeping his promise he would stupid....

We are possibly putting Canadians in danger and spending huge dollars on this when we have people that need help right here?  I don't have the answer of why we let some of our people slip through the cracks.... I don't know why CEO's need to make 300 times on average what the worker on the floor does in North America now. Back when CEO's were happy making 8 to 9 times what the folks on the floor made North America was a manufacturing power house.... now not so much. The experts tell us we are better off and we haven't voted in anyone who says different?  I don't know why as I said we have given corporations who are not people despite what the goofs on the Supreme Court in the U.S. think, 684 Billion in welfare in the last 20 yrs while we still have children living in poverty, homeless folks, and people dying while waiting for health care... The same thing applies it is a democracy and we haven't voted in anyone who thinks this wrong enough to stop it.  We have also always borrowed money in the last 40 yrs to send as aid to war torn or disaster hit countries around the world no matter what party was in charge... because nobody WE put in charge would NOT do it... (also I don't recall any government getting dumped in the next election because of it)  I am aware that a few radicals could slip though, and it could turn out to be a deadly mistake. However, since 911 the ""free"" societies of the world have given up so many freedoms for our ""safety"". We have peed away TRILLIONS of dollars we had to borrow to fight them over there and gotten no where. We have added layer upon layer of security all because the boogeyman might come do something.  One freedom we gave up fishing related that burns me to no end, is that when I was a kid we could walk out on the north pier at Goderich and fish for perch when a boat was in. Since 911 that is verboten, because a boat might be sabotaged....?  If we keep backing down from doing the right and just things that were not even up for debate for 911, then they have won, without doing anything. I believe the vast majority of the people in the camps are running from the terrorists. Just as I believe if they were from any other area and religion this wouldn't even be a discussion. They need help we need immigrants lets make it a win win situation.  Part of doing that will be good screening, just as vigilance from people here once they arrive. Now it is coming out that French authorities didn't connect the dots before the attack and they might have stopped it they had.... So keeping an eye out and reporting anything strange would be advisable and if that is profiling lets keep it up because it is also common sense in today's world."
946047,Steve,2015-11-24 00:19:00,2075," To keep it fishing themed, I agree! Try fishing border waters, such as the Niagara River or Lake Erie....few extra steps involved these days."

Totally rediculious!  It would be different if we were flush with money and the Canadians that are already here were taken care of but that isn't the case. Our health care system is already being slashed (because we can't afford to pay Dr.s and nurses; medication costs......) We have seniors living below the poverty line (because there is no more money to give them).  It's fine to keep a promise, if you can afford it!  In the last 20 yrs Canadian tax payers have been able to afford to borrow/finance/spend 684 Billion on corporate Welfare and have not looked after our own citizens any better than we do now....  Maybe if we address that issue then we would have the money to look after the programs you say we aren't and have still enough left over so 1.2 billion on refugees wouldn't be so offensive."

Welfare to corporations over the last 20 yrs is about the worst form of charity we give away... It used to be that companies would re-invest here giving back the ""gift"" by creating good paying sustainable jobs for our citizens. At a time when they paid a much higher rate of tax.  Since dysfunctional trickle down economics were invented corporations take the gifts, pay less tax as a percentage of profits. Hire many less people full time with benefits at living wages. All while EVERY indicator of productivity is up by workers here in Canada....  Then to add insult injury a lot of corps take the gift and then offshore more jobs anyway as they hide profits in off shore tax havens....  Stop the bleeding there and there would be plenty of money to look after the needy here AND bring in immigrants/refugees to bolster economic growth that are needed because we are not breeding enough...  The old system worked pretty damn well in this country for over a century, until we decided to jump into the fallacy of the equalization of wealth to the rest of the world that is called globalization.  All it has done is it has allowed 85 single individuals to own more than half the world's wealth. Pretty good deal for the 85 NO wonder they won't let it be stopped...."

Yes, he answered in a direct question on the governments ability to meet its deadline. We will play a role in making the security checks and confirm peoples identity.

I think it's important to note, this IS an international obligation.  It's not as though ""Canada"" was sitting around and said ""hey I think we should take in refugees"" out if the blue.  The UN refugee response team formulated a plan to get these people out of UN camps, because they can't live there forever. They came up with what I would call modest targets for a bunch of member nations, and then asked us to assist themv with their plan.  We said no to bombing, and as far as I know, the bombing is not UN sanctioned. I'm a little fuzzy on that point I admit I could be wrong. However, refugee settlement is sanctioned and we said yes to our international partners.  I'm not always pro UN, it's a flawed governing body at best. But we are either in, or out.

This is a result of trying to win the pr war by not bringing soldiers back for repatriation. War by game console if you really wanna be crude. There was a story about how the French work in theatre and it was a fascinating read. Will dig up the link.  can't find the link. long story short. the French send in small units of elite fighters into very risky situations (situations others might not consider worth the risk), often times with no extraction likely. they know the players on the ground and who to trust. they get in, do the job and gtfo. they don't try to stabilise or prop up governments. they do enough to meet their objectives. iow, very efficient use of manpower. they have a much smaller army so need to be economical with force. no shock and awe campaigns, well except for raqqa."

If we break one pact where does it stop? Will others decide well you didn't help the French when they asked why help you now when you needed it. Sometimes battles are chosen for you from past commitments. The flood of immigrants in Canada affects the USA  because they share a relaxed boarder and if Canada does not screen the immigrants correctly then they have an easy path to the USA who also needs to be vigilant as well to protect Canada's interests. Like it or not we share a land mass that is easily breached. The isil has stated that they will use the influx of people to increase the cells that are already here by infiltrating the countries with the masses. The other fact is even if someone comes in with nothing more than propaganda they can convert from within once given access to the country. War is War it isn't pretty it is a battle to put down the opponent to spend what it costs in men and money to reach an objective. In this case it is to stop a force that will do anything to harm people. When you are fighting this type of battle where one side has rules and the other doesn't then you expend more men and money than is needed. I am a bring a gun to a gun fight type of person you mess with my country my country had better come back at you twice over.

Eyewitnesses at the Bataclan theater recounted details about how the gunmen sliced open the stomachs of their victims and watched them suffer.   Mariesha Payne and her best friend, Christine Tudhope, survived the horrific attack by hiding in the basement of the theater for three hours. While they stayed there, they heard screams of victims. “We knew people were being tortured in the theater because we heard people screaming, but they were not being shot and these were singular screams,” she told the U.K. Daily Mail. “When we escaped, a man trapped on the level where it happened said to us the terrorists were stabbing people in the stomach. We were told they were throwing explosives at people. It was a horrendous ordeal,” she said.   Payne said she thought she would never see her two children again while she hid, listening to the Islamic savages murder innocent people. While fleeing the carnage, Payne and Tudhope escaped death by turning right instead of turning left where the terrorists were. The two were actually headed for a fire escape but ran into a dead end and had nowhere to go but into the basement. It turned out to be a life-saving move. These terrorist animals must be stopped. How President Barack Obama can allow refugees to continue to come into America after news that one of the Paris attackers posed as a refugee is beyond comprehension. Despite Republican efforts to stop the refugee resettlement plan, Obama will do his best to make sure Muslims find their way into this country. It’s no wonder people are looking to arm themselves — Americans are coming too the realization that their president has done nothing to protect them and will continue to do nothing. "

They had no plan for after the bombs fell, and are now reaping what they have sown.  In fact, the U.S. funded IS when they were under other names because they had a hard on for Assad.

I do not believe our troops should be in a combat role there, but we can train and support those that will do the heavy lifting.

I believe we have to dial back on our own hatred. If we decide that the answer to this problem is to ""turn the Middle East into a sheet of glass"", then we lose our humanity and become the monsters we claim to hate. Well writen as are most of your posts, I might not always agree with you but I always appreciate the time and thought you put into explaning your point of view.  In this case however I do agree totally with you that bombs are not the answer! I just heard on the news that the French bombing runs have killed 38 ISIS members so far. I would love to know what it costs to drop just one of those bombs! I am thinking that the cost/ is going to be extradonary.  I don't like the idea of our soldiers going into combat over there, I think that once again we are getting dragged into a war that we didn't start and isn't ours to fight but we do tend to stand by our friends even if they aren't always right, it's the Canadian way."

945409,Dutch01,2015-11-19 20:13:00,1431,"Thanks Cliff.  Your middle paragraph is on point. Who gets the money when those bombs are bought? The American military industrial complex. The same guys that are quietly lobbying Congress for more bombing.  People are emotional, myself included, but we have to stop with the knee jerk responses that we are being led into, and really look at who wants this war the most.  I despise everything IS represents, but we have to be smart enough to look past the obvious and find a lasting solution to the problem. I submit that as long as bombs rain on people they will never accept peace. They may not accept peace either way, but we can't occupy the moral high ground when our body count of innocents is much higher than 129.  As to your last point, I always stand by a friend. But when a friend is being an idiot, I don't stand by him by being one too. I tell him to smarten up (or sober up) and I make sure he gets home in one piece."

I'm also very much an atheist, but I respect this man for walking the walk. His God would be proud of him.  Anton Leiris's wife was killed at the Bataclan on Friday. He posted a letter to the terrorists online:  ""Friday night, you took an exceptional life - the love of my life, the mother of my son - but you will not have my hatred. I don't know who you are and I don't want to know, you are dead souls. If this God, for whom you kill blindly, made us in his image, every bullet in the body of my wife would have been one more wound in his heart.  So, no, I will not grant you the gift of my hatred. You're asking for it, but responding to hatred with anger is falling victim to the same ignorance that has made you what you are. You want me to be scared, to view my countrymen with mistrust, to sacrifice my liberty for my security. You lost.  I saw her this morning. Finally, after nights and days of waiting. She was just as beautiful as when she left on Friday night, just as beautiful as when I fell hopelessly in love over 12 years ago. Of course I am devastated by this pain, I give you this little victory, but the pain will be short-lived. I know that she will be with us every day and that we will find ourselves again in this paradise of free love to which you have no access.  We are just two, my son and me, but we are stronger than all the armies in the world. I don't have any more time to devote to you, I have to join Melvil who is waking up from his nap. He is barely 17-months-old. He will eat his meals as usual, and then we are going to play as usual, and for his whole life this little boy will threaten you by being happy and free. Because no, you will not have his hatred either.""  I was very moved by this and thought I would share it with you all."

945429,AKRISONER,2015-11-19 21:20:00,5558,"Read above you.  Does more bombs equal more peace?  Ill just continue to shake my head and laugh   Apperently, with topics on OFC lately, its pretty clear alot of members here like violence.  Its sad really  Then most of those members claim Canada to be a peaceful country,   I am not one for imposing violence, but the point is that if everyone takes the side that we can allow a place like syria (in the exact same way that afghanistan was) become a terrorist state, you leave a massive deal of political unrest in a region.  You dont have to like everything that our allies do, i.e. isreal, the USA, england and even France, but at the end of the day they are our allies, and as such we have a duty to fight along side them when the cause is just.  Some of us here obviously believe that the situation in Syria will never escalate further than the tribal skirmishes that have dominated the middle east for thousands of years, however others of us see the idea of a terrorist state as a real threat...please let us not forget the methods used by the natzi's in ww2. No one thought they were a threat until it was far too late.  I think in a lot of ways we need to step back and think, what if this happened in downtown Toronto, would we be singing the same tune? Everyone is entitled to their opinion absolutely, but I dont think the debate here is whether or not military action works in neutrilizing threats...the real debate is how real and big that threat is...  some here clearly feel that if we leave syria and the middle east alone, those problems will remain there and peace will prevail in our own country, others here clearly feel that the total unrest in war in those countries can very easily spill over to ours.  Personally I am not sure what sparked off a bunch of saudis and UAE's and egyptions to go knock down the twin towers on 911, as far as i was aware the United states and nato in general were not conducting any major operations aside from in Iraq at that time...but it happened, with a bunch of people that were trained in afghanistan....get my point? anyways im ranting  I love the idea of peace, but i think last friday showed us that these guys are for real and a real threat...its time to act along side our allies, because they hopefully will be there for us when crap inevitably hits the fan here in the next 1000 years. Telling someone else to deal with it and bailing out on your friends typically makes it tough to ask for help when the scenario is reversed."

Did you not start this thread by saying, if someone ever said to you, do you want to step outside, you dropped them right then and there? LOL  The only reason any rules exist in warfare is because you don't want our wounded killed or prisoners killed. ISIS is NOT following those rules so do we lower ourselves to that level? The trouble is, if the rest of the world follows suit where does it end? More importantly how does that type of warfare damage our soldiers mentally. It also then gives ISIS every justification to carry on as they have been (which they probably will regardless) is our sense of fair war a waste of time with them? Next war are all the rules off the table for it too?  It does seem like some of the Kurdish forces have decided that taking ISIS or ISIL prisoners is a waste of time because they would rather be dead so why not grant them their wish.  As for the ""trainers"" being targets they most definitely will be and will probably still accept the mission. The fact is the people from the countries involved HAVE to stand up for themselves at some point... If they don't want to be the constant victims of these type of thugs...  EVERY time we go in and save them from one diabolical dicktator we create a backlash that puts even MORE an more evil group of thugs in charge within a year or two...

If it were that simple Vietnam and Afghanistan wouldn't have been war zones for almost 30 yrs each. The total amount of bombs dropped on Vietnam was MORE than the total dropped in WWII by everybody in every theater of war.... Look at the size of Vietnam on a map it should have been a crater from border to border. The U.S. still lost that one when they pulled out the troops on the ground.  No one can even calculate how many thousands of tons of bombs have been dropped on Afghanistan in the last 30 yrs and nothing is even close to being won there yet....  Until the rest of the world is ready to go in hunt down and exterminate every terrorist. Then do the same to every potential terrorist that bombing and being there CREATES. With boots on the ground and an occupying force FOREVER, there isn't going to be a long term peace or stability in the region. No matter how many bombs they drop, and as long as there is an occupying force the people we are trying to ""liberate"" are most likely going to fight it, anyway they can. Just as you or I would if China invaded us tomorrow....  I keep asking how many times can we go over crush whoever is causing a crap storm only to get fed up and leave to have it all repeat over again? As soon as the white hats leave the terrorists seep back in.  The vicious cycle is the ordinary citizens there for some reason can't or won't save themselves no matter how much training and support we give them.

I'm all for immigration but not with the compromise of our safety.  According to the link I posted refugees have to PAY back the cost of their travel to get here if provided by the Canadian government... For some families that could be 10K. Which could more than some of might have made in their entire lives. Also if any refugees have families here they could be sponsored by the family here and the fees paid that way... One of the families I know two of the brothers have been working those 70 hr weeks to raise the cash to sponsor their relatives....  They have already had family members killed before ISIS started up, so they are very motivated to get out any remaining family that they can and they will PAY gladly any amount to do it.  I absolutely agree the number of 25000 is scary in the amount of time and probably won't happen. If some of the people in the camps got away with their documents that would certainly speed up the process for them. Also does anyone really think it actually takes 6 days of some government official looking at an application for every minute of those 6 days to get approval under normal circumstances? Much less 6 months I would wager of lot of that ""time"" the file is just sitting in a folder.  The refugee camps might have in place systems to vet applicants as well... that could help speed things up.  Lastly, if there any concern with any refugee what would be wrong with having them housed in military barracks or in a similar way until they are fully checked out. Is win win for our safety and theirs too. Here even in a ""camp"" I can't think of a better word, at least they would be feed, have clean water and some medical attention. If they are as bad off as reports would indicate then having to stay somewhere like that has to be better than being where they are now. Just while we dot the i's and cross a few ts on any questions.

Read the facts not the stupid urban myth going around Facebook.  http://ccrweb.ca/en/refugees-and-income-assistance-rebutting-chain-email-pensioners-myth  As for some of the Syrian refugees being terrorists of course that could happen with any refugee, just like anybody can be run over by a bus tomorrow. The government has always had check and balances in place with screening to try to prevent criminals of any kind from immigrating here and it has worked pretty well so far so. So as long as the same procedures are followed even if they are sped up the chances are the system will catch out pretenders before they get here....  Also I know a couple families of Syrian immigrants and I have to say they are some of the most genuine people I have ever met. Also they are to a person much more hard working than I pretend to be.... they work 50 or 70 hrs, without complaint a week, me I like to go fishing once in a while."

My refrence to the bar fights was just to show that a big guy might start it but when backed into a corner even a little guy can come out swinging even if he thinks he doesn't have a chance of winning.  With all that is happening in the world today it is only a matter of time before someone decides to call someone elses bluff and away we go. You can hide up North, down South, in your boat fishing if you want but that isn't going to change the facts.  Some have suggested ""I can live off the land"". perhaps, but can you make the medications that many of us rely on today to survive? I can hunt, fish, and know how to find a lot of ediable plants but I can't make the heart medications that my wife needs every day just to survive. Thirty days is about the best I could hope for.  Some have suggested ""doom and gloom"", well how about ""probability and possibility""? Isn't it better to be prepaired (and I'm not even sure what that involves) than be caught totally off guard?  Can discussing this change the final outcome? Probably not but pretending that the possibility isn't there sure won't either. Why bother even bring it up then? Well I learn about things by asking questions then listening to the answers, doesn't mean I always agree with what I hear but I always try to consider it and I always learn from it.  To those that think this is a waste of time, so be it, to those that think we can't change it; we probably can't however to those who think it won't happen or it isn't going to affect you, I fear you are in for a big surprise!"

They are videotaping every strategic bombing to avoid being blamed in any type of false flag operaration  The US blamed them of bombing two hospitals, that was determined to be a lie.  They are documenting and releasing info of bombings unlike the coalition.  They are covering their as....  sorry if I'm rather sceptical about Russian claims but is there a link to this information ? google isn't much help and it seems some of the info comes from RT, which, depending on one's views, has more spin than CNN or other Western media. well maybe not as much as Fox 'News'"
943257,manitoubass2,2015-11-04 00:08:00,11391,"Yeah its out there. I didnt save the links. I read rtnews and cnn and all that crap to just for a laugh. Both are just propaganda, but I find rt to be more reliable than western media in some cases  Like on CNN today they had ""experts"" talking about the downed plane and they arent even there lol. Just making a bunch of crap up  Ill see if I can dig it up"
943259,manitoubass2,2015-11-04 00:14:00,11391,It had something to do with drones video taping strikes with gps co ords

Rick, how the hell do you keep up on all this crap in BF Ontario, and have 5 plus kids, work 12 plus hours per day, fish, post here a lot, do you sleep?  I can't worry about things I can't control, hopefully cooler heads prevail.  On the news somebody said something like ""go ahead, fight your wars with YOUR sons and daughters, not mine"" and that struck a chord with me. If our shores are in jeopardy, that's one thing, but loosing lives for oil or to try and convert people to our way of life, go nuts, with your sons and daughters, not mine."

Im just not comfortable being uninformed.  And im uncomfortable being informed lol  And i agree, protect our shores. We belong nowhere but here(militarily) IMO  Then I fish to clear my brain lol. Be at peace with my kids and nature.  And work is a break too. I work long hours but i meet my qoutas quick and just hang out on here cause my jobs a breeze lol"

You can get both sides of the story rather quick( most of the time)  I still think that this is a bigger game then we could imagine. Russia is no super hero  Nor is the west, europe etc  Things arent adding up(at least to me)  Military and governments are insane, study all ya want/can and youll still never have a definitive answer"

Their very cagey and react without prejudice they are a very strong nation that's had a bad go  Terrorist types hunt them and kill them all needs to be a group effort they are going to spread and cause mayhem I really believe this to be true  EMP VERY REAL it was a side effect of the atom bomb and has been fully exploited and used by many the worlds infrastructure is not hardened to deal with this 3 bombs detonated 100 miles up and spaced evenly could potentially put a vast part of North America back to the stone age  How about an asteroid or comet impact there is no power on the planet that can stop or prevent this it's a roll of the dice impact strike I believe the other day a meteor came out of nowhere and past within 500000 mms of us I think they said it was 200 football fields wide lots of killing power there it's been along time we are due  There's a lot of crap going on now if I survive the initial strike I truly believe I have a shot at whatever it is until then  I'm seriously really enjoying my life and having a bloody good time always vigilant prepared Well time to get ready for Bambi slaying  Cheers Peter

Seems they have technology to jam a 300km radius.  Which I find kinda odd since russia jammed all electronics on a US warship and flew war games over the ship leaving many aboard(apperently) very scared about these missions near china.  If isreal has the tech youde think the US has it as well since they are allied VERY closely.  And this came maybe about a week after russian fighters chased israeli jets outta syria

Something is really wrong here.  Putin is no saint, nor is obama. But, its almost as if the US is doing this by design. But why? Why make russia look like a reamerging super power and sit idly by?  Also the US just sent in 50 coverts into syria just days before a russian passenger jet was shot down, blown up, or suffered mechanical failure that imploded the plane at 33000 feet.  Wth is going on?"

Im scared of BRICS but not as mush as US/NATO/israel/saudi arabia/britain/germany/france.  I think we might see a nuclear bomb soon, but not the doomsday type. A tactical device.  Does russia blow up israel, or is it iran?  Does a US sitting duck ship provide the next false flag as they continue to agitate china???"

My morning routine involves doing the “necessary” things, getting my coffee, checking in here to see if I can contribute anything use full then reading the news.    For the past little while I have noticed a trend and it scares the heck out of me. It seems that almost every day the US is challenging someone and these some ones are starting to challenge right back. Iran, China, Russia, North Korea, ISIS just to name a few. The incidents seem to be escalating very rapidly lately.    Several are now issuing their own challenges almost daring the US to do something to try to stop them doing whatever they want. The threats seem to be getting bolder almost as if to say “I dare you!” It seems that a real fight is brewing and Canada is going to get dragged into it whether we want to or not.    So far it has all been posturing; “if you do that again then we will have to react (retaliate)”! So far thank god no one has but I fear that at some point in the not too distant future someone is going to just to save face and war will be inevitable.    Perhaps I am reading it all wrong but I have been in a lot of bar fights in my younger years. I survived by not waiting for the other guy to “give me his best shot” and then fighting back.

What I see happening now is so similar to those bar fights; oh I’m big and tough and you better not get in my way or else!” Then some little guy like me figures what the heck and hits you! I might be wrong but I do believe that if China or North Korea wanted to hit us (Canada and the US) there wouldn’t be much left but the cleanup.    I’m not worried about me, I’m old and already figured out I won’t be around forever but I am worried about my kids and my grandkids.

He is a snake. Most of his vocal opposition had been eliminated. He wants to re establish the  former glory of the of old Soviet Union. Good thing he's broke. Oil prices are killing him. Iran has openly declared that it is their goal to eliminate Israel and the US. They are on the verge of a nuclear weapon. I don't trust the new treaty they signed. So...
