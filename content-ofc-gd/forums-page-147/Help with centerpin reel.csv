947903,BillM,2015-12-04 13:00:00,17367,I'd run the Raven line over Big Game for main line.  It's not expensive and handles the cold weather a lot better.

948007,muddler,2015-12-04 22:42:00,623,"I bought a bulk spool(2000 yds) of 12lb dacron from Cabelas years ago. I think it was a 'squid' line. I half spool each reel with it and then fill the rest (200-300yds) with mono of my choice, usually 10lb test. Never have had a problem. Using 4 different AngSpec float reesl and 2 Islanders for over 20 years that way.  I cut back some mono after each trip for wear and tear.. Once I see the dacron on the spool I strip off the remainder and respool with fresh mono. Only got to the backing once. Hooked something big near a creek mouth on Manitoulin and it just kept going. Finally snapper the leader, never saw it .  All my reels work flawlwessly now for 20+ years. Other than a drop of oil each year and a careful cleaning , there have never been any issues. I have a habit of babying my reel anyway.  Go with the dacron flyline backing, just be careful as some backing is made from some other non-dacron stuff. It's a small cost to keep your pin running without any issues.  Just my 2 1/2 cents.......muddler"
948070,Cosmos,2015-12-05 04:19:00,588,"Thank you guys,  Stopped by at Lebaron today to pickup Dacron fly line backing - they are out of stock, but they promise to get it in couple days. They don't have raven mono line. I will use my spinning outfit this weekend and prepare centerpin properly for next one."
947680,Cosmos,2015-12-03 15:02:00,588,"Hi guys,  I would like to get some help with proper spooling of centerpin reel to fish Niagara river. My current setup is Okuma Aventa 13'6"" with spinning reel. I am pretty happy about it. I bought another rod from Kevin(OFC member - thanks again Kevin) to be my backup or primary rod. It's:   I do have centerpin which is currently spooled with 330 yards of 6 Lb Sunline Mono, which is too light in my opinion for Niagara. Here it is:    I need to know what kind of line should i use on it and also if i do need any backing on it. Where is an old post which is similar to mine but i hope some one can give me more up to date information.  Thanks a lot."
947689,DRIFTER_016,2015-12-03 15:44:00,10439,"I would run some 20# dacron backing as a cushion and run 12# Raven main line. Then you can run any leader you want on your setup that the rod can handle. Also there is no need for a shot line as you can run your float and shot on the main line. If you break off it will be the leader, just tie on a new one and get back to fishing.  This is the set up I run pretty much everywhere I fish with the float rod these days."
947692,BillM,2015-12-03 15:56:00,17367,Listen to Dave.  That config will work great and won't break the bank (Compared to spooling up with superline)
947700,Cosmos,2015-12-03 16:42:00,588,"Thank you guys,  Another question what kind of dacron line should i buy?"
947703,DRIFTER_016,2015-12-03 17:18:00,10439,Just some fly line backing of any brand. Doesn't matter which as it is just there to provide a cushion and help fill the spool up so you don't have to put on 1200 yards of main line.
947707,porkpie,2015-12-03 17:26:00,2521,"If you have some old junk 20lb test line or something similar, it works just as well as Dacron for backing."
947734,Cosmos,2015-12-03 18:37:00,588,"If you have some old junk 20lb test line or something similar, it works just as well as Dacron for backing.  Like mono or braid? I've heard that mono backing is not good."
947737,BillM,2015-12-03 18:56:00,17367,You should never be into your backing anyhow.  15-20lb mono will fill the spool with ease.
947740,Ralph Field,2015-12-03 19:04:00,1018,I would remove the line guard unless your proficient at wallis casting.
947743,RDR,2015-12-03 19:14:00,125,"Looks to me that reel has a line guard. Best to remove it if possible, unless you plan on only using a ""BC style"" swing cast.....https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zNAUHV1qAk8  Thanks Mooch!  No amount of backing will help if you Side or Pull cast with a line guard reel! Mono backing is fine, as long as it is put on carefully. To much pressure can and will deform some spools depending on quality of manufacture of the reel. 150 yards of mainline on top of your backing should be sufficient for any situation   Then it is reasonable to change out your mainline a couple of times a season if you fish a lot  Beat me to it Ralph...LOL  Here comes Dave's response....LMAO"
947745,dave524,2015-12-03 19:19:00,4508," Like mono or braid? I've heard that mono backing is not good.  On some reels, mainly those with pillars between the 2 halves of the spool , mono backing has been known to wedge creating pressure and distort the spool causing problems. You are probably OK with machined 1 piece spools but I wouldn't chance it, on reels like Stantons, JW Youngs, Aerials and stuff like that .........No way would I use mono backing.   edit: RDR beat me to it by 1 minute"
947760,Cosmos,2015-12-03 20:32:00,588,"Thank you guys, A lot of useful information - will definitely remove line guard."
947763,msp,2015-12-03 20:42:00,1336,I would suggest using the cheap redwolf mono from Canadian Tire. A 1500 yd spool of 10 pound will cost less than $5. I recommend the 10# so that your connection knot is not huge. But you should probably just listen to Dave
947767,misfish,2015-12-03 21:03:00,29133,"Didnt Mike B, try that sticky one side cork stuff? How does that stuff stand up?"
947776,DRIFTER_016,2015-12-03 21:37:00,10439,"You should never be into your backing anyhow.  15-20lb mono will fill the spool with ease.  ""Shouldn't"" is the operative word here. In all my years I've only been into the backing once. It was a big hot chrome fish on the Kenai in 2009. By the time I got it stopped and turned it had 200 yds of mainline and 50 yds of backing out on me."

947833,porkpie,2015-12-04 01:08:00,2521,Nobody used Dacron backing when I started fishing with a float reel a long time ago.  Somehow we got by lol.

947848,Cosmos,2015-12-04 02:01:00,588,Found 1500 yards spool of 12 lb Triline big game line at home. Is this line good enough just to try? I dont care much about it so i can easily spool as much line as i need.
947852,porkpie,2015-12-04 02:12:00,2521,"Heck use it as mainline.  I like trilene XL 10lb for all my mainline for float reels, but I'd give it a go if I had it!"
947853,Cosmos,2015-12-04 02:27:00,588,"Thanks, so what about backing? Should i spool whole reel with this line or still use some backing?"
947870,porkpie,2015-12-04 03:33:00,2521,"It's up to you man, what you have on hand will work just as well as anything, and the price is right.  You can always leave a bunch of it on as backing if you don't like it as a mainline.  Most people use 20lb just because it requires less to fill the spool."
