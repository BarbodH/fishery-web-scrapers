947920,Headhunter,2015-12-04 14:07:00,5703,"Scott Weiland passed way yesterday at age 48. Dude had some problems obviously, but he was the quintessential front man and Stone Temple Pilots was a great band. Too young.... HH"
947922,BillM,2015-12-04 14:19:00,17367,I'm honestly surprised he made it to 48.
947924,lookinforwalleye,2015-12-04 14:21:00,4399,The needle and the damage done......RIP
947927,leaf4,2015-12-04 14:26:00,2466,Sucks to hear but he was living on borrowed time for a long time already
947929,fishing n autograph,2015-12-04 14:39:00,2540,He lasted longer than I thought he would. Great musician though. RIP
947932,Joey,2015-12-04 14:55:00,9122,Jeez that sucks.  STP is one of my fave bands
947934,pics,2015-12-04 15:04:00,1268,I thought he was younger than 48.. I too am surprised he didn't die earlier.. he just couldn't shake the addiction.
947940,Moosebunk,2015-12-04 15:16:00,3970,"Boys I played with in a highschool band all really liked STP... wasn't that into them but certainly didn't mind the tunes, have a couple on the song list and Sour Girl played just last evening.  All that talent, all the fame and success, and all that life wasted.  A shame really."
947946,manitoubass2,2015-12-04 16:13:00,11391,First album is an absolute classic  RIP
947951,Headhunter,2015-12-04 16:50:00,5703,"I've got a gig on Saturday night in Scarborough, seems like the right thing to do would be to dedicate Interstate Love Song to Scott! HH"
947958,lew,2015-12-04 17:44:00,12766,"I must be getting old, I never heard of him till something about his death  was on the news this morning."
947965,crappieperchhunter,2015-12-04 18:20:00,2582,"I must be getting old, I never heard of him till something about his death  was on the news this morning. It's not an age thing Lew. He died at 48 so he was 4 years younger then myself  and I never heard of him before yesterday.  Just goes to show how much music there is out there and how we all can find something we like and get comfortable with it and not really give anything else a good listen.  Regardless, sorry to hear the news. 48 is way to early."
947969,blaque,2015-12-04 18:49:00,2419,"STP was pretty much the soundtrack to my college years in the early 90s. I wasnt a monster fan, I liked them..........but everyone else was INTO THEM and you couldnt go a day without hearing them in dorm rooms, college bars and all the other college environments. Heck, i knew two seperate guys that played in two different STP cover bands lmao  Definitely sad, but not a shock for sure"
947970,manitoubass2,2015-12-04 18:50:00,11391,"I loved them and alice and chains, both on repeat pretty heavy in the early 90s"
947981,esoxansteel,2015-12-04 20:16:00,1307,"A great singer and frontman, for STP,"
947986,jimmer,2015-12-04 20:22:00,2730,You can only run from that lifestyle for so long before it gets you. Added to a long list of others unfortunately. Sad to see such talent lost.
947992,Sinker,2015-12-04 20:46:00,8692,"Yep, pretty sad, but a long time coming.  I was doing interstate love song last night on my new guitar.  S."
948029,Rod Caster,2015-12-05 00:19:00,5784,"Favourite song of STP was ""still remains"" . Very fitting song title for the moment at hand"
948030,Acountdeleted,2015-12-05 00:22:00,2562,"Hell of a musician. Velvet Revolver was good too.  RIP.  For me, Trippin on a hole or sour girl were my favs."
948031,chris.brock,2015-12-05 00:22:00,4053,"Like Blaque, U of G on a Thursday night was blasting the Hip, Pearl Jam, Nirvana and STP.  I find it weird how the special people that have the talent and charisma to become rock stars, also have a definite problem with self destruction."
948033,dave524,2015-12-05 00:34:00,4508,"48 is actually pretty good, quite a few favourite musicians from my era were members of the 27 Club."
948047,Sinker,2015-12-05 01:32:00,8692,Its a lifestyle that leads to addictions....not so much self destruction. Terrible either way.  S.
948051,GBW,2015-12-05 01:45:00,8460,Seen him and the brothers (in STP) play a few times and I sure will miss him. To me he made Axl Rose look like a kid when it came to style & attitude along with talent...
