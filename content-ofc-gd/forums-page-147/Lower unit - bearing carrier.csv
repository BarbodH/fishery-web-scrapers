945753,misfish,2015-11-21 03:41:00,29133, Why are you buying US?
945755,mike rousseau,2015-11-21 03:43:00,4661,Until I get pricing from my local yamaha dealer for parts it's all I can find online... I'm going to the local dealer tomorrow...  I can ship em to NY state fedex store and pick em up... 10 minute drive over the border
945757,misfish,2015-11-21 03:49:00,29133,"Take the numbers off the seals and bearings, and source local. They are not special seals and bearings.  If you get the numbers, pm me. I,ll see what I can get them for. If your not in a rush, ."
945759,mike rousseau,2015-11-21 03:59:00,4661,I kinda am in a rush... Not cause I'm impatient but today is the first day of my fall fishing vacation... If I order locally I'm looking at getting the parts Wednesday or Thursday....  Not sure if these are the right Bearing 93306-001U1-00 Bearing 93317-22204-00  That's the number on boats.net site... I'm thinking they're just what're house stock numbers tho
945763,misfish,2015-11-21 04:13:00,29133,"I dought I can get and have you on the water in a few days.  I would be interested in geting the numbers OFF the bearings and giving you a price, compared to what they (yammy wants)"
945764,mike rousseau,2015-11-21 04:34:00,4661,Will do
945839,misfish,2015-11-21 23:11:00,29133,Update ??????????
945863,mike rousseau,2015-11-22 01:29:00,4661,I got the drive gear outta the bearing in the housing.... Haven't popped the bearings out yet... I'll try that after the kids are in bed...  I've ordered all the parts... $257 to replace everything.... I'll be putting everything back together Thursday morning after my trip to quinte...
945988,hirk,2015-11-23 03:14:00,571,"I hope you are using the shop manual for it to put it together, its not a just put the parts back together thing. It wont last if its not done right."
945993,mr blizzard,2015-11-23 13:54:00,1589,"Mike I can appreciate your frustration with vacation and all the other stuff u have been thru but ,, 1        If it were me I would as mentioned get new bearings and seals, no way u just do a job half right because u will just redo it again, if your already in there do it right  2         Inspect carefully the lower end, before u do just the bearings and seals, and if you are not 100 percent on what to do and all the specs which are very important personally with it this late in the season I would have the pros look at it now as opposed to the spring when they are booked up to their ying yangs in work and possibly rent a boat or even take a charter if one is available, I realize the extra expense of that  3         I would have it serviced now, wait for ice fishing and now you are good to go in the spring just my thoughts.   I have found u cannot rush into a repair because u will just rush into another one"
946054,smitty55,2015-11-24 00:42:00,928,"Not sure exactly what your job entails but for pressing bearings into an end bell make sure to press only from the outer race of the bearing and be sure it's square going in. If you heat up the casting good you may even get the bearing to almost fall in. IMO you will only need loctite if the bearing is loose fitting and you'll worry about the outer race spinning. If pressing a bearing onto a shaft make sure to only press on the inner race or you will damage the bearing. The proper sized socket can work well and a drill press can be used as a makeshift arbour press, which is the best tool to use.  Cheers"
946317,mike rousseau,2015-11-25 02:57:00,4661,Thanks for the drill press tip... Dad has one
946597,mike rousseau,2015-11-26 16:15:00,4661,I was able to put all the parts together fairly easily...  Hub is back in... Everything is nice and tight  Put her on the muffs and everything seams good  Gunna go to the launch and make sure everything is fine under load...
947893,Smokercrafty,2015-12-04 11:09:00,227,"Drum roll please........ Annnnnnd?? How did it turn out Mike???  I read this thread, and am now waiting on the outcome. I have a 30 Johnson with the lower unit out and apart. Just wasn't sure I wanted to tackle the reassembly on my own."
945690,mike rousseau,2015-11-21 00:02:00,4661,Hello  Anyone ever change a bearing housing/bearing carrier on a lower unit... Some aggressive reverse driving and a gear slipping or something like that managed to crack both the top and bottom of the housing...  Great way to start my vacation...  I'm wondering if the seals and bearings are reusable or should I replace all the parts in the housing... The seals were just done in August...  If you've done this job before is there anything to watch out for?  Seems simple enough... Especially if I replace all the bearings and seals at the same time... Just put all the new parts in the housing and mount it back on the prop shaft...  Thanks  Mike  EDIT: I already took the housing out and the shaft etc... All the gears look great....  
945694,irishfield,2015-11-21 00:22:00,26272,Didn't you just have that serviced for the power head? Will they fix that too under warrantee? Aggressive reverse or you hit something?
945695,mike rousseau,2015-11-21 00:29:00,4661,Yes the power head was just replaced... And my lower unit seals as well... I've put over 100 hours on the motor since then...  Definitely did not hit anything...  I was in hard reverse and something slipped in the lower unit.. Maybe the clutch dog...  When contact was made again it would have acted like a hammer pushing out against the housing... This is what I understand based on a conversation with a mechanic after describing what happened... And based on what I can see now that I have all the parts out and understand lower units a bit better...  Might be my last yamaha I ever buy at this rate...
945700,Fisherman,2015-11-21 00:41:00,7201,I have reserved thoughts about it breaking that while in reverse.  More than idle while shifting maybe or something not put back together correctly if they did the rear seal earlier.
945707,irishfield,2015-11-21 01:00:00,26272,Possible they cracked the ears putting it back together and a bit of extra umph made them show up. I'd be trying to get them to come good for overtorquing the flange bolts.
945709,Fisherman,2015-11-21 01:05:00,7201,That was exactly my first thought.
945710,2 tone z71,2015-11-21 01:05:00,1311,"Ya that's not normal ""wear"" and if it was faulty it would have broke long ago with those kinda hrs"
945712,mike rousseau,2015-11-21 01:12:00,4661,To replace everything it's max $200 in parts...  It would cost me that in gas making 2 round trips across the border to Clayton NY   all I need to know is if I can reuse the bearings and seals and O rings and reduce that cost to $120
945713,irishfield,2015-11-21 01:14:00,26272,Maybe they'll send you the parts gracious!
945714,Garnet,2015-11-21 01:27:00,2056,If something slip in the lower unit it's going to slip again. Needs complete disassemble and check those clutch dogs.
945715,mike rousseau,2015-11-21 01:28:00,4661,They said last time for warranty work they need to do a full investigation on the outboard...  They even analyzed my oil...  I'm gunna call them before I order parts in case I get lucky...
945716,mike rousseau,2015-11-21 01:35:00,4661,Let's play a game where none of us talk about my original question and see how many posts we can get on this thread...  I know your all trying to help in your own way...  But...  I just need to know if the seals and bearings can be removed from the broken housing and reused in the new housing I'm ordering tomorrow... This will cut my cost in half... Or do I need new seals and bearings as well...  And if you've done this job are there any tricky tasks I will run into...  Lol  You guys crack me up sometimes...
945717,irishfield,2015-11-21 01:42:00,26272,Have fun Mike..
945722,misfish,2015-11-21 01:56:00,29133,"I have no idea about what you dealing with or how too. I can talk to you about bearings and seals though some what. I am not there to see them , also Im a hands on guy and do have a hard time saying properly the how toos, Thats why Wayne is here. LOL  Look at the seals for wear. Uneven wear. If they seem to be round and no indication of wear,you will be fine. Now the bearings. If you can roll them on your finger and feel smooth rotation with not a bit of grind or staggering, they will be fine. Are these sealed with steel or rubber? Also, look for pick up on the shaft and the inside of the bearings. Pick up is scratching on the shaft or in the inner surface of the bearing. If you have this, then you need to use like 600-up to 1200 emory to remove the groves,scrathes on the shaft and require new bearings and seals.  If the bearings are steel sealed, you need to make sure there is no indents on the sealed area. If so, you will need to replace them. With the rubber sealed ones,you will see if it is torn or broke through.  Sound right Wayne?"
945727,irishfield,2015-11-21 02:01:00,26272,"I don't know B.. he doesn't have patience to troll GBay for Musky, I don't have the patience for arrogance when someone asks but doesn't want to listen to advise."
945728,misfish,2015-11-21 02:04:00,29133,"I forgot to ask. Are there two bearings? If so, you need to roll them on your finger together. If they are  good,they will seem to roll and feel the same. If not, you will know. One will wobble sorta speak. Like I said, im a hands on guy."
945729,Sinker,2015-11-21 02:04:00,8692,Id replace them anyways. I think you may be harder on outboards than I am. Thats impressive!
945730,misfish,2015-11-21 02:05:00,29133,"I don't know B.. he doesn't have patience to troll GBay for Musky, I don't have the patience for arrogance when someone asks but doesn't want to listen to advise.  Ok, Like I said. Hands on guy here.  Then again, whats the price of some bearings and a couple of seals."
945734,Fisherman,2015-11-21 02:17:00,7201,"Not knowing how long you ran the motor in this condition, I would opt for new bearings.  Also take a good look at the gears, if the assembly has been pushed outward to the rear, those gears may have some ""extra"" and not wanted wear on them.  You may want to drop the whole lower unit and also inspect from the top side to ensure the drive shaft bearing is still in the same spot.  Just trying to help."
945736,irishfield,2015-11-21 02:18:00,26272,apparently 80 bucks Brian.
945737,misfish,2015-11-21 02:23:00,29133,"apparently 80 bucks Brian.  Thats a good price.  Mike , if you have a Canadian Bearing dealer close by, give them a call. Not sure of your home local."
945739,2 tone z71,2015-11-21 02:28:00,1311,The amount of hrs on that motor ..id be putting a new assembly in it
945746,mike rousseau,2015-11-21 03:22:00,4661,I'm leaning that way now...
945750,mike rousseau,2015-11-21 03:30:00,4661, That's the housing... Both bearings... Seals... I rings... And the 2 bolts...  I've just never done anything like this...  It sounds like I'm better of replacing everything...  Any advice on installing the bearings and seals?  I've heard you can use a socket to tap em in... One forum I read said to put locktight on the housing when installing
945751,mike rousseau,2015-11-21 03:33:00,4661,Not a skill I'm proud of...
