65875,BLACKFISH88,2007-04-29 20:36:00,191,I'm not sure but I think I can tell by the color of the shadows......the fish shadow is way too dark compared to his shadow....anyone else?
65877,lunkerbasshunter,2007-04-29 20:44:00,2585,could be a zander(think that is how its spelled) europes version of a walleye  Cheers!
65882,majorlifts,2007-04-29 21:03:00,171,Tuff call. I really dont know.
65884,Hellfish,2007-04-29 21:12:00,308,A Zander?? Damn european fish always so much larger.
65913,Cookslav,2007-04-29 23:32:00,1457,Based on the Arc of the fishes back I'd say the anglers left hand would be holding the monster by the head....except his left shoulder does not seem high enough to be doing so.  I could be completely wrong but...if I was to field a guess I say its a hoax.
65945,bassmaster4,2007-04-30 00:23:00,801,its too stiff and if he were holding where his hand is near the tail then there would be indents made by his fingers on the body of the fish because he would have to hold it pretty tight if it was real hoax for sure
65965,bigfish1965,2007-04-30 01:05:00,3382,Its not real. Shadows and such are not right. Its easy to make a small image like that look real. IT would be a 30 pound plus fish if real.
65988,POLLIWOGG,2007-04-30 01:50:00,835,"Small person, big fish? nahhh theres a giveaway. The fish is too well proportioned, it should be noticeably full of eggs at that time of year."
66014,mepps,2007-04-30 02:39:00,1301,I'd say with 99% certainty tha twit is fake.
66021,Minnow,2007-04-30 03:32:00,177,"Fake for sure! Lots of give aways, no shadow, different lighting, zoom in you can see the cut out fish!"
66044,mrdylan,2007-04-30 09:54:00,111, He's right save it to your desktop and zoom in the belly is jagged.  He is also standing to straight to be holding a fish that big he would be bent back with a fish that size.
