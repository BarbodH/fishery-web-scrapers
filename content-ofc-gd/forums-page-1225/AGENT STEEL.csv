65942,jdmls,2007-04-30 00:14:00,575,Well much can't be said about this years opener. Great water conditons up north. The rain from Thrusday Friday was light making perfect water color. 3'rd year fishing this river on the opener and every year is a prize. Lots of chrome post spawn females. One after another non stop action . Me and 3 buddies each took 1 fish home and released all the others.  Here's some highlights. Picks are from both days.
