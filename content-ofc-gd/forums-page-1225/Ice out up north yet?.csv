65739,bucktail,2007-04-29 04:13:00,1857,"Wondering if any one could fill me in on ice out up north. Specifically on lake Biscotasing and the big one Lake Nipigon. Here in the south its 2-3 weeks late from last year. Last 2 weeks in June on both. Hoping Nipigon hasnt warmed past 13 degrees by then, need the specs on shore."
65741,irishfield,2007-04-29 04:22:00,26272,Don't know about that far North Darren...but the ice went off the NE Arm of Temagami on Wednesday and most is out of the North arms as of late last night.
65743,sturgman,2007-04-29 04:43:00,249,"I was wonderin the same thing Bucktail. A few of us mongrels   are heading up to Mozhabong Lake just south of Lake Biscotasing,"
65768,Slick Willy,2007-04-29 11:43:00,18,Haven't been over to Lake Nipigon to check but the ice is rotten in the Geraldton area. Just a couple more days sunshine and a little wind and away it goes. Water levels are way down on all lakes up here. By June you will be able to watch the smoke plumes on lake Nipigon as the bush is popcorn dry.  >Bill
65769,grt1,2007-04-29 11:48:00,638,"Here on the south bay of gullrock lake, the bay is 1/2 open so hopefully in the next 3 days we'll be ice free"
65772,pameladallaire,2007-04-29 12:12:00,470,I think all our ice will be gone by next weekend.  Pam
65795,tjsa,2007-04-29 13:48:00,1578,"It is going pretty fast now, Nipigon still has ice on it on the satellite pics, but it will be gone probably in less than a week. A bunch of inland lakes are ice free now."
65796,danc,2007-04-29 13:50:00,4677, Where'd ya hear that nonsense???
