He made the rounds and hit every boat for scraps.  Turned out to be a very nice day.  The wind could be very cold at times but heated up as the day went on.   Sun was shining and I did get a not so nice sunburn but enjoyed the day.  As I stated in Glen's post, it was very quite out there with all the people and boats.  I haven't experienced that kind of quite with so many people in one spot before.  Tom"
