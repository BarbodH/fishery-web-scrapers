64555,outdoorguy61,2007-04-25 14:18:00,220,"I am trying to create a small window of fishing opportunity, to fish the fabled waters of Lake Nipigon at the end of May for a day. I welcome any information regarding guides for a trip for 1 person (I expect to pay more but do not want to be gassed). My ideal objective would be lakers and brookies. Thanks for taking a peek.  outdoorguy61"
64576,Whopper,2007-04-25 14:55:00,2174,If it were me I'd start with DanC. I'm sure he'll be able to steer you in the right direction.  Whopper

64710,danc,2007-04-25 21:46:00,4677,Exactly what date in late May are you looking at??
64748,Carp,2007-04-25 23:33:00,1488,"I'd actually be interested in some info on L. Nipigon as well.  Drove by on my way moose hunting, but never had time to stop. Would love to know when the best time for lakers is. Might make a trip too.  I'll be waiting for your report outdoorguy61. I'm sure the fishing will be awesome.  Have a blast."
64771,tjsa,2007-04-26 00:34:00,1578," Hey Remo, let me know when you are going to be up here,....................... I need some lead time to alert the appropriate authorities,"
64814,danc,2007-04-26 02:29:00,4677,  Lake Trout fishing is fairly typical up here. Flat lining in the spring and downrigging during July and August. They can often be found up shallow on rocky reefs in September.
64826,Carp,2007-04-26 03:55:00,1488,  Not thinking of fishing at that time of year Tom. Just thought I might stop off to get some info.  Does the laker season end at the end of September ?
65492,outdoorguy61,2007-04-28 01:53:00,220,Hi Thanks to evryone that has responded thus far.  Dan C. I am thinking it would be May 29 or 30 from the looks of it. I could only do a day and am very interested in any and all ideas.  outdoorguy61
65542,tjsa,2007-04-28 13:20:00,1578," Yes, the season is March 1st to September 30th. Sport fishing license: two (2) in one day. Size limit: only one greater than 70cm(27.5 in.). Conservation license: one (1) in one day. No possession of live lake trout."
65544,danc,2007-04-28 13:29:00,4677, I was thinking that maybe I could take you out for a day but I don't think that I can make any promises.  One important rule not listed by tjsa is that Lake Nipigon is totally barbless.  Good luck with your quest and give us a report if you make it out.
65566,Carp,2007-04-28 16:46:00,1488,  Thanks Tom & Dan for your info. Kind of figured the season close at that time. I agree with the season and restrictions. It's definitely a fantastic fishery that needs protection to ensure it remains that way for many years to come.  Go get 'em outdoorguy61. Don't forget lots of pics
65582,irishfield,2007-04-28 18:45:00,26272,"Dan....I know it's your home water and not questioning your input, but I've read the regs over and over again....and also always stop on the side of #11 and cast into Nipigon on our way to Hearst.  The best I can get out of the regs is that you must be Barbless on ""all tributaries up to the first barrier to migration, all waters on the islands and Forgan, Bonner, Little Bonner and Jackpot Lakes.""  Are you saying that the entire body of Lake Nipigon is also barbless??  Thanks! Wayne"
65603,danc,2007-04-28 20:14:00,4677,"Yes Wayne. The entire lake is barbless. The note that you mentioned is the definition of the area, except you didn't put Lake Nipigon in the quote. Below is copied from the regs.  Lake Nipigon - all tributaries up to the first barrier to migration, all waters on the islands and Forgan, Bonner, Little Bonner and Jackpot Lakes.  No possession of live brook trout or lake trout. Brook trout catch and possession limit of one (1), which must be greater than 56 cm(22 in.) in length, conservation licence limt of zero (0).Single barbless hooks must be used all year.Artificial lures must be used when angling through the ice."
65608,outdoorguy61,2007-04-28 20:41:00,220,"Hi Dan C Should you be available, I can commit to either day. Hopefully this will somehow come together.  outdoorguy61"
65611,irishfield,2007-04-28 20:51:00,26272,Thanks Dan for clearing that up.
65784,Moosebunk,2007-04-29 13:13:00,3970,"Yipper, thanks Dan and clan.  You know all this info is a great help.  I have it in my head to get there too, soon enough.  In the meantime... I'd better learn how to fish... single barbless is something only for pro fly fisherman. lol  Dan, when I'm there you're calling in sick if you have too."
65794,danc,2007-04-29 13:48:00,4677," That's a done deal MB.  And just a few notes about fishing barbless. I never attempted fishing barbless before it became law on my local waters. I urge all of you to give it a try. I can think of only one or two fish that I might have lost because of barbless hooks. But then again it just might have been my own fault. Most of the time the hook just falls out in the net, or with a small twist of the hook with a pair of pliers at boatside if you're not using a net. All of Manitoba has been barbless for quite some time now. I think it's time for Ontario to get on board. There is an argument that barbless hooks actually penetrate deeper and cause more damage, but personally, I don't buy that. Any other opinions??"
65799,Moosebunk,2007-04-29 14:11:00,3970,"Fished barbless out west Dan.  All new species and territory so I can't really compare, but, after a week long trip this July where it's mandatory, should be able to formulate a solid opinion on this one.  The penetration think... don't think any hook can go much further beyond the bend in the shank. lol.  Caught my first brookie ever on a barbless mickey finn."
