I might go out at midnight if I can't sleep.   Let the games begin.  Hope everyone has a good year, good luck.  Here's my good friend Brad, he came up in May last year and we got into some nice ones (the bigger one was 29"") I usually release and he always keeps everything so we compromised and kept 2 instead of our limit of 4.  These particular fish spent the night in the live well because we got to the cooler and barbecue before we could clean the fish.  Woke up with a huge hangover, cleaned and ate the fish for breakfast.   "
