65595,Beans,2007-04-28 19:29:00,3339,The two Tonys were catching some...Meely was catching some...peoples in the boats around us were catching some...me?...SKUNKEROONY !!!...Sheeeesh !!!  Maybe I've lost me magic touch...  I noticed the crappie were biting very light as they hardly moved the float at all...I gave it four hours and the damp and cold was getting to me so I packed it in...  Am now changing over to a lighter float for tomorrow...and sharpening my hook...
65598,GbayGiant,2007-04-28 19:38:00,1780,"Go gett'em tomorrow Beans. Set the alarm clock on the other side of the room, so you have to get up to turn it off. That's what I have to do."
65674,Nanook,2007-04-29 00:34:00,565," I'll be over there tomorrow Norm,and I'll show ya how   'Bout 10:00am, I like to give the fish chance to wake up  ,"
65677,motv8tr,2007-04-29 00:40:00,2587,"Well Beans, at least someone in this family is fishing...go get 'em...and don't rip their lips off.  Maureen"
65679,ccmtcanada,2007-04-29 00:43:00,7971,Good luck tomorrow!!!  At least you got out there...that's what it's all about.
65754,crappieperchhunter,2007-04-29 10:21:00,2582,"Hopefully you have the ""pattern"" figured out by Tuesday. I will see you then. I'm betting the water is crystal clear in there still. You got any 2 or 4 LB leader line? Good luck Beansie...but save a few for me."
65757,solopaddler,2007-04-29 10:47:00,8605,"Good luck on Sunday, with the warmer temps it should be even better."
65771,pigeonfisher,2007-04-29 11:58:00,696,The pattern is Meelys dock!  say hi to him for me if you see him today.  How does my old boathouse look?  Still yellow?
