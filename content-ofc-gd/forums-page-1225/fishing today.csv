We got there at about 7 am and began bottom fishing with a slip sinker and worm. The wind was very bad btw. I hooked into the first fish. A sucker my first one ever weighing about 2 pounds. It was a great start to the day coming about 20 minutes in.   Here is the Sucker. (sun was in my eyes) lol    Later I went back to the car to get our drinks and was coming back and my dad was yelling to hurry up. So i ran and just made it. Snapped some pics of this nice channel cat he had. Unfortunately we had no landing net and it kept thrashing while i was trying to grab it and snapped the line.  Channel Cat   About 10 minutes after that my dad had a huge hit. His fishing rod almost flew into the water but he caught it and set the hook. The fish began to peel drag and run far down the shoreline. After about 5 minutes of trying to find out what it was we seen that it was a carp. We managed to land this one. It was also my dads personal best carp weighing in about 7 pounds. It looks skinny in the pic but it had a big belly. Its amazing how much drag it peeled.  Dad's PB Carp   The wind began to kick in but that made no difference. My dad caught a small bullhead. No pic of that it was too small my dad just put it back in. About an hour passed and we hadnt had a hit. We had thought we were finished for today but we were wrong. I had a monsterous tug and set the hook. I thought i had missed the fish but i reeled up a bit and my rod bent. I began to reel and noticed it was a heavy fish. I was sure it was a carp. After 10 minutes of fighting this beast i finally saw it. It had peeled so much drag. When i got her near shore she was out of gas and was easily landed. It was my first carp weighing about 10 pounds.  My first Carp   It was a great day. Pb's, first carp and sucker for me, first sucker for my dad. This has been my most succesful day out on the water and I am hoping for more days like this in the future."
