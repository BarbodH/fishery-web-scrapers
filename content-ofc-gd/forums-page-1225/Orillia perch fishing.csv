There were lots of small perch and we caught about 75 fish to find 9 keepers.  Had fun and my motor is running perfect.  Its for sale in the classifieds if anyone needs a 20hp."
65711,pikehunter,2007-04-29 02:19:00,1659,"Good post, a couple of keepers is better than none. Where's all the jumbos and the tagged ones hiding?"
65923,lovetofish,2007-04-29 23:41:00,500,I was out by the narrows today...  Saw a few jumbos mixed in with huge schools of smaller ones...  Seems like you have to fish through the smaller ones to get into the jumbos.  lovetofish

66079,Tdel,2007-04-30 12:36:00,393,"Nice perch Glen,  I was out in the narrows Sunday too.  Didn't catch any nice ones until later on in the day.  Most perch were small.  Released them all.  Also didn't hear of anyone catching a tagged fish.  Don't want to hi jack your thread but I have a question for you  Glen and Lovetofish .............. is it always that quite out there during the perch festival.  Wow!  For a large group it was quite.  Tom"

66101,glen,2007-04-30 13:37:00,2641,Mike this is the motor i have had for about 20 years that is for sale.  TomD when i was out on saturday everyone was quiet but for the one boat with teenagers in it.  Most people were just trying to keep warm.
