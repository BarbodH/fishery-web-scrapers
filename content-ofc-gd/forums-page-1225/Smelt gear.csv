Basically you had to get there early and get the best spots and you had a good chance to fill a pail. And of coarse you needed some bright lights. They started passing after midnight.  We were in a  bad spot and only managed a handfull(30). We left around 1:30. I get to Toronto and I noticed they forgot to load the net contraption thing. So now I have to buy a new one. My question is, where do you buy them. I prefer 6 feet and how much do they cost????"
