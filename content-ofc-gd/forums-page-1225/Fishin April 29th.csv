66000,Rich,2007-04-30 02:27:00,3927,"Well today was quite the day. Action for the channel cats started off quick and we managed to get 3 on shore and on video. Nothing huge but better than we've been doing lately. Eric posed for a still picture with one of the biggest of the day.    Like I said, not huge, but not small either. PS thanks Fishmaster for the cut bait!  Later on in the day I decided to try my luck for carp. I was able to get one on shore (also on video) using the ultra light and 6lb test. Great fight even though its just a little guy.    That was it for the day. Wow did it ever get cold out there once that sun dropped and the wind picked up. I thought it was January for a minute. haha  Thanks Eric and Jenna for the good times! We may have enough footage now to piece together an episode."
