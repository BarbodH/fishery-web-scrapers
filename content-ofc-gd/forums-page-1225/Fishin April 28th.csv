65580,Rich,2007-04-28 18:33:00,3927,"Today, Greensot, Sleded and I hit a local spot hoping for carp and cats. We got into a few bullheads and Sleded got into a beauty 32 inch carp. It was all caught on video too. But for now we'll have to settle for pics.        I think Sleded's secret was his new bait bucket. Great idea Sleded.. no more worries of bringing extra gear!    Thanks for the great day guys I had a blast. See ya tomorrow Jed!"
