There was a good rain yesterday evening, so I figured it should be ‘easy pickings’ for worms.  Indeed it was after only 15 min I had caught 50 Dew Worms.  Not bad considering it was the first time out this year picking and I missed about half or the ones I saw.  I’m set for Saturday.  Get out there and pick yours too !!  Entropy"

64118,Guest mistyriver1,2007-04-24 14:30:00,0,Great to hear.  I saw some in my driveway last night when I came home so I figured it would be a good night for them.

64320,Clampet,2007-04-25 00:26:00,1947,"Way to go, I guess the motion outdoor lights would disturb them."
64687,mdej,2007-04-25 20:35:00,98,When picking do you use a regular flash light?  I've read that using a red light (either bulb in flashligh or cover) does not disturb the worm so they don't disappear back down the whole
65441,xrap,2007-04-27 21:53:00,683,I went out after the rain last night and found a nice worm bed. Picked up over 200 less than 10 mintues.
65485,glirw,2007-04-28 01:16:00,200,"Wow ! talk about a challenge !  I didn't believe that we have fat nightcrawlers in my backyard , boy was i wrong ! theyre everywhere ! I got two and that was NOT ez . I'll be back out there tomorrow night after I have more time .  Any advise on how to get those tricky sots except speed and force ?  Pliers ? Scissors ?"
65487,brifishrgy,2007-04-28 01:30:00,559,take your time ... look at where the worm hole is (get your mind out of the gutter) and grab there ... that way if your slower you have a better chance of getting them
65501,Rizzo,2007-04-28 02:12:00,4754,"yup, grab 'em by the hole...works every time"
65508,pikehunter,2007-04-28 02:30:00,1659,"Just went out and checked the backyard, the front and the sideyard. Not a worm to be had. Guess the grub killer I doused it with last year might have killed them off.  My father had the same problem at their house, used grub killer and then could not find a worm. But why is it the grubs still live but the worms are gone?  Sure seems that way anyhow."
65516,Sinker,2007-04-28 03:02:00,8692,"My lawn is crawling with worms right now. I should go take a picture....its unreal!!  That is usually a first ""real"" sign of spring. Also a good time to go smelt fishing!!  Sinker"
66127,Entropy,2007-04-30 14:59:00,747,"Yep, I turn the motion lights off.  I use a hand held LED light, and don't use the center of the .... 'beam' but the outter edge to spot the worms.  Grab the light coloured end of the work;  it is the end closest to the hole.  Entropy"
