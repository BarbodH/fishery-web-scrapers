65551,douG,2007-04-28 14:04:00,2693,"I was looking at Gerritt's hand thread, and noted a few replies.  Although this obviously wouldn't help G, I know that some of us are suffering from scar tissue related stuff, like sciatica, carpal tunnel, frozen shoulder, tennis elbow and so on.  Please, please, please, before you have someone cut you, see a professional who practices Active Release Therapy.  It is not chiropractic,  but is often performed by chiropractors.  For soft tissue problems, ART boasts a success rate of 90%, much better than surgery.  This is in five visits over two or three weeks.  Most health insurers in the US will not pay for these types of surgery until ART has been done.  There's gotta be a good reason for that.  Just type your postal code on this page to find a licensed practitioner close to home or work.  If you try it and it doesn't work, and  you are ticked at my lousy advice, pm me and I'll look after the cost of your treatments.  When has douG ever steered anyone wrong?  It's only massage fer chrissakes.  Don't make me have to come over there."
65552,irishfield,2007-04-28 14:26:00,26272,"Well there was this time....  They should pay you commission Doug. You are ART's poster boy and I don't mean Aplumma...   That is a heck of an offer to put up that is much appreciated...but would hope nobody would expect you to pay for their medical attention.  Seriously, Doug and I have had this conversation many times and definitely a route to take before any surgery. Nothing to lose and everything to gain with high success rates and no bad side to it like surgery.... if it doesn't work. Surgery will definitely be my last step and while Doug keeps kicking me I'll get into the ART specialist sooner or later. I've changed the way I build some stuff, to take some repetitive motion out of the equation and that has done wonders. Now if I could stay off this darn fishin forum I'd be even better..."
65563,Roy,2007-04-28 16:11:00,13728,"Well, well, well...we've finally found a use for ole Art.  Over the years I've carried a few women on my shoulders at the beach and it really has buggered my left shoulder....that last one was especially corpulent. Someone, please find me Art's phone number."
65571,Guest Trophymuskie,2007-04-28 17:34:00,0,Naturally nothing around these parts. Would not drive an hour for any kind of treatment. there just isn't enough time in a day.
65591,Clampet,2007-04-28 19:26:00,1947,"It's not that 'ole bar a soap thang is it??!!!??!!  Jest kiddin'.  I will look into it, and I very much appreciate you sharin' a cure fer those of us so afflicted.  I take back all those horrible horrible things I said about you."
65607,douG,2007-04-28 20:33:00,2693,"I posted this thread because it worked for me in a week or so, and for 18 out of 21 folks I have hounded to try it (I'm keeping track).  Two of them even had carpal tunnel surgery that didn't work for them.  Unfortunately, Spiel was one of those that it didn't help.  If you can't find a practitioner locally from that search page, start checking out local chiros to see if they do that.  I expect that the directory has a monthly fee...so not all might be found on the link I posted earlier.  If you get surgery without trying this or decide to continue to suffer, you deserve to be old."
65621,aplumma,2007-04-28 21:45:00,6896, So let me get this straight if some one is unhappy with ART you will pay them right. Well you should see the check you are going to have to write to make my WIFE ....... ( a little light humor here that is not meant to take away from your generous offer).   ART
65698,Daplumma,2007-04-29 01:22:00,1961,"I have Arts phone number but I still have this pain in my @ss,funny but the PITA has the same phone number.douG,Great to bring light to an issue that bothers more people than you know. Joe"
65699,Greencoachdog,2007-04-29 01:23:00,8163,"Massage therapy eh?... does it work for groin pulls?  ... but on second thought, if ART is goin' to be doin' the massagin'....  Seriously though, my left elbow has been givin' me the dickens for the past few weeks... may have to check into it!   Trophymuskie Posted Today, 12:34 PM Naturally nothing around these parts. Would not drive an hour for any kind of treatment. there just isn't enough time in a day.   If you aren't willing to drive for an hour for treatment... you're not hurting bad enough yet.   Roy Posted Today, 11:11 AM Well, well, well...we've finally found a use for ole Art.  Over the years I've carried a few women on my shoulders at the beach and it really has buggered my left shoulder....that last one was especially corpulent. Someone, please find me Art's phone number.   For some reason I can't picture you carrying a corpulent woman on your shoulders on the beach... it's not that I don't believe you... I think it's some kind of a subconscious mental block on my part."
65813,Dano,2007-04-29 15:08:00,719,"Thanks for the info douG, now if I could only to get you to pay for my R & T therapy the world would be blissfull."
65941,PatB,2007-04-30 00:08:00,104,"DouG thanks for the link, Marlene is going to check it out, if it dose not work for her. If I were you I run as a fast you can... LOL"
