Our lake only has Lake Trout open at the time, and even then the fishing isn't great.  Any suggestions for lakes to try in the area w/ boat launches? We can always try Lake Joe, and I've started looking at Blackstone Lake, Healy Lake, Moon River and Go Home Lake, but I'm not sure because I've never fished the waters (don't get up that often). I have topo maps of the area with boat launch info, but i'm not sure how up-to-date the launch site info is.  Any help would be appreciated...   Thanks,   Norm"

There is an abundance of Pike there and all of the waterway is relatively protected for boating since most of the bays under less then a half mile across. Clear Lake, Little Whitefish and Big Whitefish hold mostly Lake Trout and require down riggers or copper line."
