65655,bucktail,2007-04-28 23:47:00,1857,Well after an agonizing 11 month wait my PB best pike (see avatar) is done.  Swung over to advanced to pick my baby up and drop a deposit on my PB Largemouth caught many moons ago.  Shawn and James did the World Class job again!  I have some shots from there showroom Ill post later.     On the wall      Close up!!!     D

65661,lew,2007-04-28 23:55:00,12767,Truly an impressive fish and I still remember your original post when you caught that brute.  It's certainly one of biggest pike I ever recall seeing caught by an OFNer.....congrats again !!
65665,bucktail,2007-04-29 00:01:00,1857,"Thanks Guys  Ill have to do the guitar pose!  For those who are wondering it was a carpenters dream.............      48"" x 24"" With a guessed weight of 29-34 pounds. I cant imagine what she would have weighed 3 weeks earlier full of spawn."

65671,taper,2007-04-29 00:13:00,611,"Just curious, is that a skin mount or replica and how much does a mount like that cost. I only ask because I have seen some of Advanced work and was very impressed."
