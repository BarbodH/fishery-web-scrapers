LeBarons was $925.....Radio World was $850 and West Marine was $825  West Marine seems like they're mostly Garmin products and only carries a few Lowrance items but said it was no problem at all to track my unit down and order it in for me.  I called BPS in Vaughn and even though they carry Lowrance, they didn't have the model I wanted and refused to order it.  The unit I wanted isn't in Canada yet and nobody knew when it would be available, so I ended up getting it from Cabelas, but  just thought I'd let you Toronto folks know about the  store at Lakeshore & Jarvis and that they seem to offer some decent service and pricing, plus they carry a very large selection of boating gear.  And no.....I don't work there"

65878,Fang,2007-04-29 20:45:00,1330,"Lew  a couple years back they opened up a store in Oakville, just west of Trafalgar on Cross. This has been my salvation store ever since. Staff could be more knowledgable about marine parts though they do try their best. Usually my questions are a bit off the wall trying to make a square peg fit in a round hole. If you need anything marine they usdually have the exact fitting, screw, bracket or whatever you need  It sure saves having to always try and modify CTC or Home Depot stuff.  As far as pricing goes I find it 50-50. I ended up buying my VHF connectors and antenna there total $ 105 and found the exact same at BPS for $25 cheaper. I know it would have cost me more than $20 in gas to go there.  I'm a regular now dropping by about once a month just to wander through. Just bought a really neat 3lb fold-away anchor that will be perfect for back lakes and fly ins up in Temagami."
