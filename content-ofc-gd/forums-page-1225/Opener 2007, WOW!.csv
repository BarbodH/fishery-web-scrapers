Arrived at 4:30 and got 2 before dawn, as soon as first light hit it was non stop with 5 drifts in a row 5 fish landed. I ended up going something like 9/16  but lost count along the way. 2 males, 7 or more females with only one being fresh. Sadly, my camera died on the first picture and my cell camera does not work in the dark! I managed to get one picture off my cell phone around 7 30 AM and some more should be coming to me via email later in the week.  Here she is,  "
