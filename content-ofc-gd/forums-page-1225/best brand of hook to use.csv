65467,bassmaster4,2007-04-27 23:56:00,801,for trout daiichi's are good
65468,Clampet,2007-04-27 23:59:00,1947,I'm partial to Gamakatsus.
65475,tjsa,2007-04-28 00:45:00,1578," What trout are you asking about, creek trout, lakers, steelhead, browns?  For walleye fishing, I mostly troll with worm harnesses in the summer, and use #4 VMC's to make my harnesses.  For steelhead, Daichi or Gamakatsu, #6 & 8. Have used # 10, but prefer 8's.  Lakers in winter, I use a #4 treble, usually gamakatsu, #6 for walleye and brook trout."
65477,Greencoachdog,2007-04-28 00:55:00,8163,"Daiichi's are the worlds sharpest hooks... don't leave home without them!  ... and if you can ever get the technique down for using a circle hook, you'll never want to use anything else!"
65546,Sinker,2007-04-28 13:47:00,8692,"Im partial to the eagle claw wide gap hooks. Laser sharp. I don't like hooks with offset eyes, I find they pull out a lot of times.  The Diiachi's are a good hook too, but the small hooks have a tiny hole in the eye.....just makes it hard to get your line thru when its cold out and your hands are frozen.....but they are a great hook. Nice and light, the minnows can really move around with them.  Match your hook to your bait size. For med. minnows I use a #12 eagle claw, same for trout, but depending on clarity, might need #14's. For small pinhead minnows, I use the #14's. If your using bigger bait, bigger hooks. I fished the whole winter this season with #14 hooks on 4 lb test for everything from perch to simcoe whities/lakers with no probs.........have been for years.  Sinker"
65578,mepps,2007-04-28 18:21:00,1301,I used to use eagle claw - now I go for Mustad usaully.  I also like VMC and gamagatsu  REcently I have used VMCs since that have great trble with a single hok that stick out beyond the other two  
65610,spanky,2007-04-28 20:48:00,195,i like raven hooks for trout... and mustad ultra points for bassin'... Gammy's seem too be too thin and bend easy and lose the point fast... just me tho
65670,xrap,2007-04-29 00:11:00,683,GAMAKATSU!! Best hooks ever. I have them for every kind of fish from trout to catfish. They are defitnatley well worth the money. I would never use Mustad hooks. One time while catfishing I had a little bullhead and when I got the plyers out to get the hook out the hook just broke in half. And I have never used them again. You will defitnatley not be disapointed in Gamakatsu hooks.
65855,dsn,2007-04-29 19:12:00,1018,"I used to use ""ultra points"" I found that they can hold a sharp point fish after fish. I use them for carp and a smaller size 6 for lakers."
65857,bassmaster4,2007-04-29 19:18:00,801,ill second the gamakatsus also i just got back from a fishing trip boy are they strong
65866,sirfish,2007-04-29 20:08:00,175,"I find the Daiichi's,Gamagatsu's and mustads all good but my go to hook for Walleye,perch,crappie is the Tru-turn ,blood red , with the offset the hook turns as the fish bites resulting in more hookups."
