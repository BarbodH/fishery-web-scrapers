65831,majorlifts,2007-04-29 17:54:00,171,"Ya, ok so my buddy sais, to much rain + crazy crowds = unpleasant experience. dont go to the eastern tribs, try the credit for res fish, ""trust me you wont catch nothing""  NOT TRUE, NOT EVEN CLOSE!!!!!! He was right about one thing, I didnt catch anything, GOING TO THE CREDIT that is!!! water was toooo cold and really high. Area north of hwy 25, Caledon.  MY POINT, ccmt`s post  siverstreek`s post  fang`s post, and so on. Just look at some of the posts made by canadian copper in the last 2 months, bly and the rest of em, what great trekers they are, my hats off to them all. People go on and on about how they dont look forward to the huge crowds on the tribs and whine about spots being given out and blah blah blah. If kicking a dead horse pleases you then have at er. I think I speak for many when I say ""Its boring the hell out of us all"" But I for one will not be taking advice from anyone in future, and I suggest you all do the same. Just go out and get er. Give 100% and dont expect anything. Go with your gut feeling, and you will find fish.  Oh, and follow MNR regs thats always important."
65833,Hellfish,2007-04-29 18:05:00,308,  WOW someones happy. Sorry to hear about ur luck im sure u will have some good days ahead.
65836,Roy,2007-04-29 18:07:00,13728,We learn something everyday. You did good all the same though. This was just fishing advice...you could have gotten wrong advice from a medical specialist or a stock broker. That might have been a lot worse..
65838,majorlifts,2007-04-29 18:11:00,171,"good point Roy. Im not angry just a little upset I didnt listen to my gut feelin ""GO TO THE TRIBS"" it said. lol"
65848,Canuck2fan,2007-04-29 18:45:00,1444,"Dude- ALWAYS trust those instincts.... Last Saturday I was talking to the guy who mentored me in the ways of the Chrome. He said there was NO WAY anything would be biting the next morning total waste of time yadda, yadda, yadda. I smiled and went home knowing that the next morning I was going to get fish no question about it. Sure enough I got to the spot I told him that I was going to fish, I deliberately fished on the wrong side of the river going against all the logic and numbers I have seen over the last year at the spot. I had 3 fish on and two landed before anyone else had a bite....  Long story short there are days when you KNOW you are going to get fish and when I get that feeling I go regardless of the weather, logic or common sense and I have always done well.... I just wish that feeling would hit more with steelhead than it does with bass LOL."
65852,douG,2007-04-29 18:56:00,2693,I'm going to take your advice there on that one.
65853,dsn,2007-04-29 18:57:00,1018,"Yep if you listen all the folks , all the time you'll end up missing the miracle, whatever it is. Some times you have to defy all odds and go with what I call (the Holy spirit tells you)a feeling.  You get them to drop their tongue everytime.  I know cause I go against all the odds about most things and I stand still til it all passes (comments and criticisim) then I move.    dsn"
65983,ccmtcanada,2007-04-30 01:33:00,7971,"It's a tough call on these.  You just never know what the tribs are going to be like from day to day.  The creek we fished on opener was really shallow, ultra clear, and the fish were easily spooked.  From everything I've heard, those conditions are NOT good for steelies.  We didn't care...we didnt want crowds, so we headed to this out-of-way spot and had some success.  I think you learned a valuable lesson...go with your heart....even if you get skunked, at least you'll know one way or another.  Oh yeah....thanks for mentioning bly and I in your post....it was kind of flattering....LOL"
66013,majorlifts,2007-04-30 02:38:00,171,"Well it seems you and Bly walk the walk, judging by all the great pics you have posted lately. Sorry to hear about Bly`s knee, shes a real trooper."
66022,Bly,2007-04-30 03:45:00,1556,Have to agree with you on this....always go with your gut..I get reminded of this everytime I don't do it lol  Good news....there are still fish in the water......go get em!   bly
66025,MJL,2007-04-30 04:21:00,2427,"I don't know about you, but with my busy schedule, I'm thankful for just getting outside and fishing any chance I get - fish or no fish - It really doesn't matter to me...At least I'm outside doing something.  If catching was that important to me, I'd go to the nearest trout pond to fish - guaranteed action there."
66026,majorlifts,2007-04-30 04:51:00,171,"I actually did ponder that. in fact I was hoping maybe after I could try to get a few at Birds just to have some good eats. because I love rainbow trout. Fillet it, shake some flour on it, a little salt and butter BAMM!! some of the best eatin right there. omega 3, omega 6, tons a protein, and best of all, essential amino acids the body requires to repair muscle tissue.  Call P3TA and tell them I found out why they all got arms like a 12 year old school girl."
