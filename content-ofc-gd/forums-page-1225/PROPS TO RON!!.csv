Belleville, this year Ron hooked me up with awesome lively minnows that lasted for weeks without airation. I couldn't believe it caught all kinds of fish this winter averaged one fish per outing on the ice. I fished a total of 15 times this winter and Rons' spots always produced and his bakers dozens are the best I've seen this side of the bay bridge. Just figured I owed him one THANKS RON!!! "
