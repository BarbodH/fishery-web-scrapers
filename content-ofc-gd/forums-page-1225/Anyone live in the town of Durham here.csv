65196,charlied,2007-04-27 02:25:00,584,Anyone live in the town of Durham here...PM me please and thank you!
65234,Jer,2007-04-27 10:52:00,1426,"I don't think Durham is a town. More like a Region or County...includes Pickering, Ajax, Whitby, Oshawa, Bowmanville, Port Perry, etc. Maybe you need to be more specific."
65237,pigeonfisher,2007-04-27 11:09:00,696,"Durham is a town North of Mount Forest on Hwy 6.  Nice little spot.  All amenities and a lot of ""big box stores"".  Jer, do you research!  hahahaa"

65830,charlied,2007-04-29 17:31:00,584,"i went to a place last year and there was nobody there from 3pm to dark, I fished different parts of the Saugeen all day long and only saw maybe 4 anglers all day, it was nice."
