65615,Fang,2007-04-28 21:14:00,1330,"Hit the same river I've fished opener for last 18 years now. With last few years being pretty dismal for fish I was hoping for a turnaround with cooler weather and recent rains. Sure was not disappointed  Got to the parking lot at 5:30 and no cars???? Did I get my days wrong. Finally 1 other car pulls in. Hit the first pool not 100 yards from my truck and on the first drift hit a 24"" male as silver as can be. Great fight and start to the day.  When the sun finally came up I had gone 3 for 4, all smaller fish and all on worms. I could not get a sniff on roe. Picked up several more small silvers (2-4 lbs) and then moved up to the next pool. Still not another fishermen in sight.  First drift through this pool turned a nice 28"" male for Team 8    The river had good quantities of fish and perfect water color. Anywhere the drift slowed and was deep enough not to make out the bottom usually had trout. Tons of 6-10"" trout in the river. Trying to keep these off the bait was tough. Was like having rock bass around while walleye fishing.  As the sun got higher fish dropped to deeper pools and log jams.  The last part of the morning was spent in one big nasty log jam. Every 10-15 minutes would produce a very good fish. Problem was landing them in that mess.  Hit a couple that would be close to 8-10 but no chances landing those.  A couple more of the nicer ones    Actually lost count after landing the 12th. First time in a long time that has happened.  All on worms and more bottom bouncing than under floats. Definitely looks like a mid week sick day."
