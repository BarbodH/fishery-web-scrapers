65432,Terry,2007-04-27 20:38:00,14456,"yeah, looks real goood"
65434,huntervasili,2007-04-27 20:43:00,1604,Hey.. thats way more productive than the outcome of me being bored... usually it makes work lol very nice harnesses btw
65446,Clampet,2007-04-27 22:14:00,1947,"Gotta say that looks real professional.  How do you feel about the Tackle Buddy, it is a Foam roll which allows one to store those type of harnesses. "
65493,FinS,2007-04-28 01:59:00,463,clamp it  I like the tackle buddy i usually put them in small bags or i get a piece of plywood and i hang em on for in the boat
65497,Rizzo,2007-04-28 02:07:00,4754,what's a worm harness
65503,easton13th,2007-04-28 02:13:00,371,Great work! Products looking good.
65507,Clampet,2007-04-28 02:23:00,1947," It's kinda like, U know horse racin' 'cept the guys get together have a few brewskis, and put these tiny hand made harneses on selected worms, then they place bets on em while they crawl around a track."
65560,Golfisher,2007-04-28 15:41:00,586,"Where can I get those little plastic bags?  I have a few tackle buddies, but they are taking up too much space and my tackle bag is running out of room.  Would CT or Walmart have them?"
65562,Carp,2007-04-28 16:09:00,1488,Nice job on the tackle FinS. Wish I had time to be bored.
65565,BryceBurzynski,2007-04-28 16:46:00,181,Good Job!
65588,Handlebarz,2007-04-28 19:22:00,3790,dollarama 100 for a buck cant beat that and if ya need bigger ones you get 50 of them.  Nice job I have tried them all different colors and stick with good copper and red beads.
65594,GbayGiant,2007-04-28 19:29:00,1780,"They look great. I just made about 30 a couple days ago to, I retie new ones every spring and use all the old good parts, just change the line and broken parts. Good for another year."
65605,FinS,2007-04-28 20:31:00,463,  thats what i do if they get exposed too long in the sun
65606,FinS,2007-04-28 20:32:00,463, thats what happens when your laid off too much time on your hands
65685,Nanook,2007-04-29 00:49:00,565,"  Rizzo asked a perfectly normal question, Why the corny answer?  Rizzo, a worm harness is a piece of line or wire, with 2 or 3 hooks attached  at intervals,usually has  small spinners at the head.Hang a worm on to  the hooks, and drift it over weedbeds. With experience, they can be made quite cheaply, but for first time use, buy or beg a couple"
