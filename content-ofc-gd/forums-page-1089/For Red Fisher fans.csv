I already have a copy of one of his ""book of poems"" but I never knew that he made an album.  front cover;    back cover    I haven't actually played it yet because my 1960's era turntable isn't working but apparently it's Red Fisher narrating the poems set to a symphonic background."
156697,TroutnMuskieHunter,2008-02-02 20:45:00,1362,Does that ever bring back memories  ...used to sit with Gramps and watch that back in the 60's..
156771,FISHINGNUT,2008-02-03 01:10:00,253,I wish I could find a video collection of his old shows
156786,Rizzo,2008-02-03 01:52:00,4754,"there's some good titles there, especially ""t'was the night before fishing"""
156792,superdad,2008-02-03 02:50:00,353,"Speaking of Red Fisher,I was sorting books last week (moving bookcases) and I ran across my copy of his poems.  Fortunately, I met Red at the VIA Rail Station and was able to have him dedicate and autograph the book.  It's a treasure - the Record would be cool.  Funny, somebody MUST have the TV shows somewhere - perhaps they'll come out some day."

156807,waterwolf,2008-02-03 04:36:00,556,"hard to even imagine the fishing opportunities that man experienced . he broke the trail for every show out there today .fishing didn't involve the big payouts it does today .sponsors must have been hard to come by.  yeah , it was a great show for a kid to get his feet wet in the sport  . the first show i remember seeing with a strong conservation message . hats off to a pioneer ."
156815,outdoorguy61,2008-02-03 07:21:00,220,"That was interesting to see. I have one or two of his book of poems (there were two made from what I have seen). I had not heard of the album but will now look for it.  I got to meet hime twice and was in some limite correspondance with his son at one point as I wanted to find out whatever happened to the film set used. I never did find it, but sure would have liked to.  outdoorguy61"
