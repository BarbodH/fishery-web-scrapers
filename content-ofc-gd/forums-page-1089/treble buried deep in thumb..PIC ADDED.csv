156458,mistaredone,2008-02-01 23:09:00,913,The first hook I put in my arm past the barb I ripped out and almost passed out.  The second time in my hand I did the push through method and it was much better but I never pre cut my hand and I think its better that way.  Less broken skin and less beer needed.
156467,albany_guide,2008-02-01 23:18:00,23,"Ouch...that hurts.  I was there once.  Had it happen while working as a guide.  Remote location....had to use the string method.  It hurt like heck.  If you have a choice, use the hospital method."

I feel for you Pete!!"

Didn't have the luxury of the ice or pain killer. LOL Never fun but you chose the right method!  It's actually easier when someone else is pushing it through, when you have to do it yourself, you know when you're going to push! Heal quick! Cheers, Dave"
156317,Whopper,2008-02-01 16:02:00,2174,"Geesh Pete, hope it heals up alright for ya bud.  Don't know about the hook but I'd of help ya with the brews  Kudos to the one's with the good advice!"

156350,Squid,2008-02-01 17:52:00,1656,"Ah Roy it's just a lawyer ........  JK. Good to hear that you were brave enough to handle it all with the wife Pete. As mentioned, tetanus shot+ another whiskey shot is required. Ohand yeah let's see pictures.,"
156352,aplumma,2008-02-01 18:02:00,6896,Well that was fun now what do you want to chill and clip off next? I have found that after you ice it down if it still hurts get a can of compressed computer cleaner can and give it a 1 second burst of liquid BUT NO MORE so you do not freeze the skin. Then you have about 3o seconds of no pain to work the hook out. you can also get a syringe and irrigate the wound with hydrogen peroxide and then use an anti biotic cream like nesporin to finish it off. The tetnus shot is still a must have though if it is done right it should hurt more than the hook did the next day. That should keep your mind off your finger hurting.    Art
156362,setomonkey,2008-02-01 18:45:00,872,"Ouch! Hope you sleep it off okay.  I have been lucky so far, stuck myself a few times with hooks but never past the barb.  A buddy of mine got one past the barb on the water, and he pulled it through himself. I was willing to help, I think, but he just went and did it.  Mike"
156370,fishnsled,2008-02-01 19:01:00,3520,I hope you're doing better today Pete.  Now where are those pics.
156375,brickNblock,2008-02-01 19:05:00,598,"Would like to thank Rick and douG for their medical support..... Wayne for your motivation........ and my wife for just plain telling me to man-up.... ""Your not comming to bed with that in your hand""....... I dont know how many times she struck that razor blade before hitting the right spot but it is out......    We've just finished shovelling.......N-shovelling the driveway so will be heading into town for a few items including a tetnus shot....  I'm missing a few items and have them on backorder but have close to a dozen lures complete for those that have asked for them.....Going to consider a new 'Blood' line of lure...."
156380,fishnsled,2008-02-01 19:14:00,3520,"WOW!! Ask and you shall receive!  That looks nasty.  Good call on going in for the tetanus shot.  When we get out again next year Pete, I'll take one of those new blood line baits.   Take care."
156385,irishfield,2008-02-01 19:19:00,26272, I'm sure not the first.. or the last time you've heard that !
156421,wjw,2008-02-01 21:34:00,35,"I had this happen to me on Nipissing about 15 years ago. I lost my grip on a small pike and it slapped the other treble deep into the web of my hand.  The most immediate problem was securing thrashing fish. It took me 20 minutes to force the tip though and then I cut the wire below the barb. I then backed the shank out.  Back at camp, I was told to add salt to warm+ water and soak it as much as possible. I did this throughout the evening and the next morning there was no pain or infection. The salt draws out the posions.  I have used this salt ""bath"" a number of times since and it works like magic."
156423,Kirk,2008-02-01 22:08:00,347,"So if I really was having a stroke, I'm definitely logging on to another web site.  Glad it worked out bricknblock, although with all that blood I think you should still see an MD, let me know about suing the hook manufacturer...those hooks are way too sharp if they can cause that much blood shed"
156438,ecxstriper,2008-02-01 22:26:00,343, Don't belive her she has super glued many of my cuts together many times.  Glad to hear you are ok . And know that nothing sticks out as much as a swore thumb
156442,wjw,2008-02-01 22:36:00,35,"About 15 years ago I had a small pike slip out of my hand and the second treble hook dug deep into the web of my hand. It took about 20 minutes to force the hook out the back side. I cut the shaft below the barb and backed the remaining shaft out.  When I returned to camp, I was told to soak the hand in warm+ with salt and repeat the application as often as possible. The next morning there was no pain or infection. Over the years I have used this salt ""bath"" on a number of times and it worked like magic."
156450,brickNblock,2008-02-01 22:43:00,598, Kirk.........that was hilarious Bud! Most of that blood was caused by my lovely bride... The hook was so deep..it just looked black inside until I attempted to bring it back out the way it went in but being a large treble it brought out some things that were yellow in colour and I wasnt to happy with what I was seeing .. so from a thread I believe from MuskyBill back a few years ago I remembered thaT it has to pass through on the route of travel and the shank backed out. Yeah it was bleeding but near as much as what happened after my personal surgeon went to work on it.... Perhaps I should keep this on file tho...... If the day ever came where divorce may be an issue it could provide evidence of abuse......  Oh yeah........I blew my beer budget for the weekend...dang! ..too many last night for anesthetic.
156175,brickNblock,2008-02-01 01:31:00,598,"yo all....... typing wiyh my left hand while  treble stuck into my thumb right up to the shank. any tips from them that knows........ been stuck for about half houir now. tried rippig it out, but just more blood and me hollerin'..... anyone know... sorry....no pics yet"
156177,bigfish1965,2008-02-01 01:32:00,3382,"Either string method or doctor method, bud.  http://www.aafp.org/afp/20010601/2231.html"
156178,irishfield,2008-02-01 01:40:00,26272,Into Trenton you go.... let them take it out right or risk nerve/muscle damage.
156180,Greencoachdog,2008-02-01 01:50:00,8163,"if it wasn't up to the shank you could turn it thru til the barb poped back out and the cut the barb off.  Since it's up to the shank, you may want to seek professional help."
156182,mbac31,2008-02-01 01:53:00,904,I would cut it at the end and push it all the way through. Thats what they will do at the doctor. It does pain for a little bit but it does work. Then soak it in Peroxide and let it air dry over night. I caught one in a few months back pretty deep. I cut it where it was sticking out and just bit the bullet and push her through. Pains like a son of a b***h for a few seconds. Freeze it with a couple of  ice cubes for about 10 minutes first though.  Good Luck
156184,mufasa001,2008-02-01 01:56:00,37,Who else wants to see a picture of this!  I would be making a trip to the doctors/hospital/clinic.
156186,irishfield,2008-02-01 01:56:00,26272,I imagine I know what Pete was doing at the time... it's a 6 or 7/0 !
156187,bassmaster4,2008-02-01 01:57:00,801,let me be the fourth to reccomend the doctor method
156190,brickNblock,2008-02-01 02:05:00,598,"thanks zll,,,,,,,,,,lol wayne...its a 6/0 for someone  spevicial....... just cut off the remaider of the lure and deffiniteoly will not try the........ ;'string pull method...........thnx tho rick for consideration....... gcd.........im thinking there is about 12-15mm of sashank left.............poope...sorry man..about 5/16in left on the shank...........thinking il push whats there rihgt thru the other side and go the kni-plex thing its too much snowstorm righyt now for hospital/"
156191,goober,2008-02-01 02:07:00,14,I had one taken out a while back and let me tell you the doc had to harp on that puppy just to get it to budge. I asked if I should have just ripped it out and was told that it wouldn't have been a smart thing to do. Plus the barb was a little short so off to the xray to make sure there was nothing left inside. It was funny to see how much force was needed to get it out...................NO HOOKS FOR YOU!!!!!!!....................got to the doc.
156192,irishfield,2008-02-01 02:07:00,26272,"Well if all else fails Pete... and if you've already tried the ""pain killer"" method...call a cab for the ride in!"

156200,Rizzo,2008-02-01 02:30:00,4754,"good luck! I helped a friend push one through before.  Found it tough to push it through the skin on the other side so I took a knife and made an opening on the far side.  I thought it worked great! He didn't seem to enjoy it though.  We would have gone to hospital but that would have cut into fishing time.  Couple of ice cubes, couple of shots of JD (for both of us) and it was all over."
156201,irishfield,2008-02-01 02:31:00,26272,I'll open the front window so I can hear you
156206,douG,2008-02-01 02:39:00,2693,"Gather your knipex and a VERY sharp blade, and a container of ice water and some peroxide.  Soak yer digit in the ice water until it is numb and start the push through process, using the blade to make a small incision when you know where the point is going to just pop right out there.  Knipex should end  your attachment to that pesky little hook.  After everything is clear, soak in some more peroxide, trying to get the bubbles working all the way in.  You are lucky to have a helper monkey along, if nothing else she can go 'Oh dear' at the appropriate times.  You still need to see the Dr., I think a tetanus shot is also in order.  The Helper Monkey can also take pictures, we like pictures."
156209,motv8tr,2008-02-01 02:41:00,2587,"ok, I'm in pain just thinking about it.  I hope you can get it out without causing further damage Pete....if you're going to have a few beers before hand, ya might want to let Charmaine pull the thing out  .  The idea of a couple of ice cubes before hand is also a good idea...along with the peroxide...  Good luck bud....  Maureen"

156232,brickNblock,2008-02-01 04:15:00,598,"6 beers in 30 minutes......... 2 oz. of canadas best whiskey.........  Soaked for about 20min. in ice.........Thanks dougG.very much.  Pushed the hook out the other side and cut the shank then pulled the barb through........ backed off the shank and pulled it back out the way it went in. Ahahah.........joking now but.........Charmaine made several slices with the razor blade before she hit the right spot for the barb to poke through..  Folks....I've got pic's............ Not tonight tho............too many beer to figure out how to do it ............ For sure Ill post them tommorrow for those with the liking for such things.  dougG.............thnx mang! rizzo........well, rizzo...j-k thnx all  surprising how quick the pain goes awaY..........need a new pair of kni-plex tho...6/0 hooks are pretty thick and the torque with the compression whilst  leading off my wrist for balance was not all that welcome .took 3 attempts for a cut clean through.  Emergencie over an out............. again.... thanks for all your help.............dougG........yer a marvel at times Bud. pete  (Marc gonna love these lures)"
156233,irishfield,2008-02-01 04:25:00,26272,"It'll hurt worse than your head in the morning bud ! And a tetnis shot's in order if you haven't had one in a while. If you can't remember... you need one, especially with it being in there that long."
156235,douG,2008-02-01 04:33:00,2693,"Yup, Wayne, what I said earlier about the tetanus shot.  Insult to injury in choosing the large muscle group for the needle, but that's what OFC is here for.  BnB, just glad to hear that you can get some sleep tonight maybe.  Flush that sucker with H2O2 again tomorrow, but keep the air to it once the bleeding stops.  Bandage it loosely if you must, just to keep the pj's tidy.  And get yerslef to a walk in, Dr., or emergency care for that shot, I'd suggest right away.  We don't need no pictures of that.  If this doesn't work out, you can always amputate, no worries, you'll still probably survive."
156242,tschirk,2008-02-01 04:47:00,261,Maybe should have save the lure and taken the thumb....
156244,Mike the Pike,2008-02-01 04:52:00,3421,So Captain were you ice fishin when this happened or just doing a winter clean up of the summer tackle.  Hope all is well.OUCH
