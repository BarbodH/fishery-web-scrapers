156043,snag,2008-01-31 16:33:00,1932, Glad you like it!  Clive from Fishingfury.com will be selling them soon.  (hopefully that plug will result in some more payola from NickyNineFingers)
156084,Puckhead,2008-01-31 19:31:00,377, I'm off to dollarama!
156236,fishinggeek,2008-02-01 04:34:00,325,"I admit I was sold.  Bought 2 at a local dollar store.  Bought the biggest ones hoping they'd be the best to cast.  I do appreciate not worrying about chucking them near rocks, branches, and other snags.  I'll make a note of doing the modification in case the lure breaks mid-fight.  My theory is try and get good stuff at the best price, and at a buck a piece, I'm trying them hoping I find a real bargain.  I tend to usually root for the little guy, the littlest guy in the fishing business is us.  I'll keep you posted on how they do, and hopefully I'll find that gem in the dollar store that Snag was blessed with."
156284,Rich,2008-02-01 12:44:00,3927, Yeah.. but when a Dollarama gets crushed you're out $1. When a Rapala does (had iy happen first fish with an X Rap) you're $8 or more.  In the spirit of this post I went and bought 14 lures yesterday from the dollarama.
156311,The Urban Fisherman,2008-02-01 14:40:00,2050,"Hey guys,  When I was going to college in london my tackle box was stolen from the deck of my fraternity house right downtown, and being a ""starving student"" I had to restart my lure collection from scratch, so off to the dollarizzo I went and for a whole season all I used was those dollarama lures....  Here's what I learnt.  The mini crank baits never swim right....I never had any real confidence in them anyways, so I didn't bother trying to tweak them.  The poppers worked ok, but they're super light and nearly impossible to throw on a baitcaster, so I used a spinning setup for them.  As for Snags bigger Rap style lures, I didn't have a HUGE amount of luck with his silver orange one, but I SMOKED pike after pike one weekend on the west arm with the Green sort of perch paterned one.  And my Go-To lure for Smallies in the Thames, was and still is the 3"" pink and Silver dollarama lure.  I never had any troubles with the lures themselves falling apart, BUT I highly suggest replacing the trebles, as they tend to rust out pretty quickly.  Good Dollarama Fishin' guys!  Cheers, UF"
156337,drwxr,2008-02-01 17:12:00,453, show us what you got ?
156571,fishinggeek,2008-02-02 03:54:00,325,"Good luck with them Rich.  Out of 14, hopefully a couple will become a ""top 5"" lure.  That's what I'm hoping for with my 2."
156591,snag,2008-02-02 06:16:00,1932,"     This is hilarious! This post has had more hits than Pink Floyd.  I REAAAAAAAAAAALY don't want to be the advocate for cheap lures.  Urbano Fishermano has had a similar experience with these lures. Most are CRAP. Select the winners.  This particular lure has worked I believe due to: 1. Colour 2. Pattern 3. Action (as CCMT mentioned; so messed up that opportunistic pike will attack!) 4. My rugged good looks & 5. SECRET. You'll get it quickly. it's dumb but it's timing/ lure's longevity. Hint: Cheapness, snags, bent hooks=prolonged time in water=less harm to fish! hUH??  Remember, A hook and a worm/minnow is cheap bait.= Gold  Don't be deceived by the alure and marketing of $$ baits.  Don't forsake Quality.  Confidence is key. or Chi. Treat cheap lures like dead bait; Modify and fortify.  Modify and fortify.  Disclaimer: I shore fish. Therefore, I cannot recommend these baits for trolling.   Adi√≥s!"
156780,Rich,2008-02-03 01:25:00,3927,"Okay so I can't count apparently, I only bought 13. lol I realize that a lot of these won't run true, but I have a lotta time before spring to tune them in the local duck park. If they don't work.. then who cares, I'm only out by a buck. If I'm fishing ponds or whatever those little topwaters should be great.  "
154932,drwxr,2008-01-28 22:43:00,453,"found these in dollarama @ majormac&bayview 99cent a piece, cant go wrong with that "
154967,pikehunter,2008-01-29 00:06:00,1659,"Yep, pretty neat looking lures. Can't beat the price either, at a buck a pop you don't mind loosing the occasional one. At least that is better than 5 to 7 bucks left snagged on a log.  And they can catch fish, however as any lure they are designed to catch the fisherman first."
154981,Terry,2008-01-29 00:48:00,14456,"thanks for moving, much better  for the price, if they  track ok in the water you can't go wrong"
154982,Rob,2008-01-29 00:52:00,467,Hopefully there is no lead paint in them either!  Rob C
155264,fishinggeek,2008-01-29 14:11:00,325,"I know I'm going to pick some up next time I'm in the area.  Thanks for the info!  I find all my lures, no matter how expensive they are, come with a lead paint warning.  Something about complying with California disclosure regulations..."
155275,Rich,2008-01-29 14:44:00,3927,"The crankbaits have never run properly for me, and I've bought several. If you have some time to spare you can tune them right though.  Other than that, the other baits work well. I've been impressed with the Dollarama stuff actually, lol. They have a Chug Bug imitation now that I can't wait to try. I swapped the hooks and dressed the rear end a bit, but still a nice lookin' bait."
155324,Hooked,2008-01-29 16:49:00,891,"They do look nice.  First thing I would do is see if they run true, if so, replace the split rings and trebles.  Too bad I don't them around the Dollarama's in my area."
155377,bassjnkie,2008-01-29 18:41:00,1101," I used the popper(top left) at my pond, hit 6 fish in 30mins. Biggest was approx. 6Lbs. That is just using it out of the package. I noticed the cranks have to be tuned. They do work well for the money!!  Daniel OCH"
155386,ccmtcanada,2008-01-29 18:54:00,7971,"Snag has dedicated entire threads to his success at catching pike on those dollar store cranks.  I've seen him catch with them...mind you, they dont track properly, which may help with those aggresive pike."
155486,mistaredone,2008-01-29 22:44:00,913,How is the weight on them?  Every cheap lure I have ever bought has been light which sucks for casting.
155499,drwxr,2008-01-29 23:13:00,453,"they are a bit lighter than the expensive ones, but not too much, you can still cast ok"
155605,Weeds,2008-01-30 05:56:00,782,"I tried a few of the minnow bait cranks and agree that they needed tuning. Last dollar store outing I scooped a gold rattletrap, was heavier than the other crankbaits and swam pretty well. My favoutite of the cheapies so far although I've never come across some of those that you've got pictured."
155636,outllaw,2008-01-30 13:14:00,1232,you get what you pay for it. try getting a product exchange... im not slamming the product but... i have seen folks burn large. one order was 15000 bodies. not one was worth being a paperweight.
155639,lew,2008-01-30 13:40:00,12767,"I dunno, maybe it's just me, but when I'm buying fishing tackle, I'm looking for quality gear, something that's gonna stand up when the going gets tough, rather than looking for the cheapest, flimsiest knockoffs from the bargain bin of a dollar store.  I'd sure hate to have the split rings open or the hooks pull loose from the bait and lock a fish's jaw closed and have him starve to death, or even lose a nice trophy fish because of lousy equipment.  Not counting some pickeral stuff,  I don't think I own a musky bait that cost less than $20 and I have some lures that are over $100 each, but at least I'm pretty well satisfied that for the most part, they'll do the job their intended to do.  Maybe I'm wrong and nobody will agree with me, but that's the way I look at things."
155642,mistyriver1,2008-01-30 13:59:00,600,"I tend to agree with Lew and Outlaw.  I live by the addage ""you get what you pay for"".  Not slamming the product either, I like to buy stuff at the dollar store as well; however fishing tackle is not one of them."
155665,mistaredone,2008-01-30 15:22:00,913,$100 dollar lure  wow I bring a snorkal and goggles fishing and my most expensive is $30.  Id imagine a $100 bait swims around freely serching out fish biting them and bringing them back to the boat.  Lol
155666,irishfield,2008-01-30 15:25:00,26272, Naaa.. that's what the $750 Golden Retriever is for !
155668,snag,2008-01-30 15:36:00,1932,"   I agree also.  However,  As you've seen in my reports and as CCMT remarked there is one particular Dollarama lure that has outperformed any of my $20+ rapalas, salmo, zuri's etc. etc.  I have reinforced my dollarama lures with a strand of 65# braid threaded through the eyelets of the hooks and attached to the leader. Just like Rich, I've changed the hooks on a few as well.  I really wouldn't bother if this particular lure wasn't so darn successful. The colour and action are fantastic.  I also take a lot of risks and chuck lures in high snag potential areas and would rather lose a dollar then a dozen probing a spot.  My neices, nephews, other reckless relatives and friends have made a dent on my tackle box (+ wallet).   For bass, most  of the lures above are fine. Anything bigger and the plastic will break and the fish will suffer.  Get rid of the jointed one. It'll break.  Quality lures are best for serious fishin'"
155689,drwxr,2008-01-30 16:24:00,453,"i also believe you get what you pay for, i came across these lures by accident, i dont even like fishing with crankbaits, i like plastics more than anything else."
155697,cranks bait,2008-01-30 16:45:00,721,"I've been suckered into these, not once but twice.  Hanging out at Dollarama while my wife shops and boom, shiny fishing lures, must have some. Insert Homer Simpson drool noises here.  They looked great and were cheap.  Well I tried a couple of them and was not impressed.  They were way too light to cast any distance, and had terrible action.  I didn't even bother putting it in a box for a maybe later or even donate it.  I threw it out it was that bad.  I then tried a diver that they had.  Stoopid me for even thinking it would be different.  Needless to say, I am not a fan of them."
155707,Puckhead,2008-01-30 16:58:00,377,"This is a pic of a rapala after a few tussles one morning with a couple of ""average"" pike.  Those dollarama lures would be torn to shreds.  "
155770,drwxr,2008-01-30 19:11:00,453," no doubt about it, cant compare good quality lures and cheap ones, i will try how they work in spring and see if they are worth keeping, poppers will do the job eventually, but you never know. Hey, Lew does that $100 lure comes with gps in case you loose it ?"
155775,Handlebarz,2008-01-30 19:31:00,3790,I love my $ store lures they were gifts from my daughter and will not see the water as they look and feel cheap but they do sit in the box so that when she is sifting throught it she sees them and when she asks what to use I tell her something different. its like most of the stuff there its not worth the $ you paid for it. just through away after use stuff at them stores. And yes I do shop there but dont depend on anything bought from the places.
155804,snag,2008-01-30 21:08:00,1932,"O.K.  The gloves are off  I would put this one Dollarama lure in my top 5. It simply has out-performed MOST of my Rapalas.   Here's some proof Various esox having a snack on the same lure.         They are cheap, they may break. As I mentioned earlier I've modified it now so that it's indestructible. The modification took 2min. at a cost of .30cents. Braid and crazyglue.  I would trade my Rapalas for this lure.  Just wait till I post my Dollarama spinner bait post. Gadzooks."
