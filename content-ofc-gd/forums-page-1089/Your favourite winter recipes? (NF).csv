153615,Gerritt,2008-01-23 22:44:00,6129,"My moms creation...  Sophisticated meatballs...  Pretty simple but will feed an army!  Meatballs take 3-4 or 5 pounds of lean ground beef, Venison or turkey for you non red meat eaters.. Add various spices (to your taste) Add Chopped onions Add Chopped Celery Add some cooked rice (non instant works best) Breadcrumbs and a couple eggs Mix with your (hopefully washed hands) and form into meatballs.... BIG ONES! should get about 18-24 Meatballs. Place on a tray and put in the oven till the internal temp is 170 degrees.   Sauce  This is simple..... Get a whack load of can of Campbells Mushroom Soup..The condensed type.. (Best bought from costco) Get a honking brick or two of cream cheese (also from Costco) Cut into cubes Pepper to taste.. Simmer on low till cream cheese is melted Add more pepper now add a bit of milk... about a cup to make is nice and smooth   Add the cooked meatballs to the sauce and simmer about 30-35 minutes... Enjoy a beer.  Cook up some broad egg noodle Spoon sauce and meatballs over the noodles...  Be careful here... I bet you cant eat everything you took! LOL   Enjoy.  G."

153666,Joey,2008-01-23 23:52:00,9122,"Yes Gerritt, I remember that.  Heart attack in a pot  That was some goooooood!!!  Paul still raves about it to this day.  I think I'll have to give it a whirl.    Here's one of my own fave's  Potato, Leek and Chicken Pot Pie ala Joey:  5 or 6 waxy potatoes, cubed.  2 tbsp Butter  3 Skinned Chicken Breasts, cubed  1 Leek  10 Mushrooms, sliced  2 tbsp flour  300 ml Milk  1 tsp Dry Mustard  2 tsp chopped Fresh Sage  225 g Filo Pastry or puff pastry  Frozen assorted vegetables (peas, carrots, etc.)  Paprika  Onion Powder  Celery Powder/salt  Garlic Powder  Parsley  3 tbsp melted butter  Cook the potato cubes in a saucepan of boiling water for 5 minutes, set aside after draining.  Melt the 2 tbsp butter in a frying pan and cook the chicken cubes for 5 minutes until browned (or used leftover chicken or turkey)  Add the leeks and mushrooms and cook for 2 minutes, stirring.  Add the frozen vegetables and cook and stir for another 1 minute.  Stir in the flour and cook for one minute.  Gradually add the milk and bring to a boil. Add the dry mustard, fresh sage, potato cubes and the remaining spices and leave the mixture to simmer for 10 minutes.  Add more milk if required.  Meanwhile, in a deep pie dish line half of the filo or puff pastry.  Spoon the sauce into the dish and if using filo pastry, line one sheet of filo and brush with melted butter, then another filo pastry sheet, and brush with butter, etc. until you have added about 6 filo pastry sheets (more if desired).  If using puff pastry, just line with enough puff pastry to cover and brush with melted butter (you will not need as much melted butter).  I like using both, the bottom of the pie with puff pastry and the top with filo.  Cook at 375 deg for about 45 minutes or until pastry is golden and crisp.  I can't stress enough how important it is to use fresh sage.  It will not be the same if you use dried sage.  Enjoy  Joey"
153729,Daplumma,2008-01-24 01:29:00,1961,Good stuff so far.We need a recipe section on this board somewhere.I am partial to this fish chowder recipe.I use a bit more bacon than the recipe calls for.Thats American bacon by the way. http://www.in-fisherman.com/magazine/recip...01_FishChowder/ Joe
153735,Gerritt,2008-01-24 01:39:00,6129,"  Ask and you shall receive!   http://www.ontariofishing.net/fish-recipes/  Now to get that All-Kn0wing All-Powerful Busy webmaster of ours to update it!

Uhmmm Spiel I'll add yours to my bartenders cook-book  G.  Keep em coming guys!  PS... Pete get one from your wife! LOL.... must be nice to be a ""kept"" man LOL!"
153817,motv8tr,2008-01-24 11:09:00,2587,"Sorry Gerritt I can't help you with the chili, as much as I'd like to, sadly I can't eat the beans that go with it   I can however provide you with a Mac and Cheese like you've never had  You need a decent sized caserole dish,  cook about 4 cups macaroni elbows, while that's cooking shred up lots of Cheddar Cheese, I use old because I like the bite of it, but any will do. Have flour and pepper and tomato juice on hand.  cover the bottom of the caserole dish with macaroni...just, spinkle about a table spoon of flour over it, add pepper to your taste and cover with shredded cheese. pour some tomato juice over it, maybe just enough to wet it. Put on another layer of macaroni, flour, pepper and cheese and tomato juice.  Repeat until caseerole dish is almost full.  for the last layer, leave out the flour, pour on the tomato juice until the dish is pretty much full, cover the top with shredded cheese....the more the better  Bake in the over at 375 for approx. 45-60 minutes, uncovered.  If you like crispy cheese, turn on the broiler for the last 5 minutes or so.  If you really like tomatos, add some chopped tomatos to each layer.  I have also added onions to mine, the variations are endless  I hope all that makes sense, no one has ever written it down before as far as I know.  Maureen"

Let stand for a few minutes to dissolve. Sift the flour and salt into a large bowl. Stir the yeast mixture and egg into the flour and mix into a smooth batter. Stir in the currants, raisins and apple. Cover the bowl, and leave the batter in a warm place to rise until double in size. This will take about 1 hour. Heat the oil in a deep-fryer, or heavy deep pan to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Use 2 metal spoons to shape scoops of dough into balls, and drop them carefully into the hot oil. Fry the balls until golden brown, about 8 minutes. The doughnuts should be soft and not greasy. If the oil is not hot enough, the outside will be tough and the insides greasy. Drain finished doughnuts on paper towels and dust with confectioners' sugar. Serve them piled on a dish with more confectioners' sugar dusted over them. Eat them hot if possible."
153862,Headhunter,2008-01-24 16:08:00,5703,"Chicken Paprikash This is an old Hungarian recipe which is essentially, Hungarian style stew. You can substitute stewing beef for chicken (veal is also quite nice) but by in large, most use this with chicken. (My personal favorite is the same recipe as below, with a pound of chicken livers  added as well!) -one large onion - finely chopped -enough chicken to feed your crew - I prefer chicken on the bone = more flavour - cut into pieces -one large and ripe tomato -garlic! as it's my ""birthstone"" I put in more than most! - fresh and finely chopped -Paprika - 3-4 tablespoons -water or chicken stock, your choice -salt and pepper to taste -cayenne pepper to taste - 2 tablespoons of olive oil - lard works just as well! LOL (if you have access to smoked/dried Hungarian sausage  ""Chubai"" , dice it and fry out the fat and substitute the sauasge fat for the olive oil. Those who like heat, get the hot Chubai! Jsut remove the cooked out sauasge before adding the paprika. You can always add the sausage back in , just before serving!  Ok, here we go! -bring a large stewing pot up to heat. -add chopped onions and oil to the pot. stir the onions continuously until they go brown, DON'T LET THEM BURN! IT will taint the whole dish! -as soon as the onions are browned, add the paprika and take the pot off the stove... stirring the onion and paprika mix until the paprika starts to cook (you may need to put the pot back on the burner for a few seconds, just to keep the heat up. You'll know when it's cooked as the colour of the mixture will be dark brown. -remove the pot from heat, add the garlic, chicken pieces and tomato. -add the water/stock to only cover3/4 of the chicken... adding too much stock/water will dilute the sauce -add salt, pepper and cayenne (to taste) and bring pot to a boil -reduce heat to a low simmer for at least two hours -serve over rice, noodles or what ever you like! This recipe will most certainly stick to your ribs and keep yer innards warm. HH"

153963,Tarzan's Jane,2008-01-24 23:35:00,1183,"Mushroom Chicken - can be eaten all year round    My personal favourite  3 - 5 pieces of boneless skinless Chicken breasts 2 - gloves of garlic, minced 1 - package of sliced fresh mushrooms, or as many as you like 1 - can of condensed mushroom soup (50% less salt - better for ya) Use the empty can of soup and fill with milk....can use skim milk.  (can also do half milk, half water) Egg noodles  In large fry pan, on high, cook the chicken in olive oil for 5 min each side. Once the chicken is nicely browned, remove from frying pan and set aside.  Turn temp down to medium-low. In same frying pan, add the minced garlic for about 30 seconds.  Then add the mushrooms.  Allow the mushrooms to cook a bit. Then add the can of mushroom soup.  Fill the empty soup can with milk, (can do half milk half water) and add to mushrooms and garlic. Stir a bit and replace the chicken back into the frying pan. Simmer.  In another pot (hopefully you ain't the one doing the dishes), boil water and add your egg noodles.  (amount varying of how many are going to eat) I also like to steam broccoli and have that as well.  Very tasty...and quite healthy.  Enjoy."
