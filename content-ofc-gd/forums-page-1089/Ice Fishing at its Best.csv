156577,jjcanoe,2008-02-02 04:24:00,744, Give Ling a try.  They are the best tasteing freshwater fish around since they are basically a landlocked cod.  MMMMM!  jjcanoe
156583,mbac31,2008-02-02 04:43:00,904,I have a problem with those as well. I grew up eating them from the ocean. The ones here taste good but are a little on the soft side. The ones from the saltwater have a harder flesh. I do eat fish from here. I will eat crappie in spring and the brook trout. I will eat quite a few brook trout each year and wild rainbows from a few lakes up north. Smallies from the deeper lakes taste ok as well. Drowned in a pound of lemons anything will taste good chased with a few brown pops.
156785,jjcanoe,2008-02-03 01:50:00,744,Ling are best baked in foil on a BBQ or over an open flame.  They don't seem to hold up as well in oil  jjcanoe
154684,mbac31,2008-01-28 01:09:00,904,"Finally got out for some ice fishing with a good bud of mine and fellow OFNer jeffw. I have not been able to get out lately due to a broken hand and this was a treat. Met at the Rotten Ronnies on #12 in Beaverton and off we went to Trombleys for minnows and then to the lake. We got on the water around 7:15 am to alot of slush and a new skim of snow. People please cover those dam 12 "" gas auger holes. My dumbass fell into one and thank god for the clam suit and the irish setter boots that I didnt get wet. We had an awesome day with a few nice eyes landed and quite a few lost at the hole. I need to get a bigger auger,  . We lost some nice ones but still managed to catch a few keepers and some nice perch.  Guys the ice is thick  (12-14 "") with around 5-6 "" of sluch. Started to freeze over good when we left a little while ago. There was alot of people on the ice today as you can tell by the pic. The bite was steady most of the day though.  24 ft of water seemed to be the majic depth today.  jeffw with one of his fish       "
154686,irishfield,2008-01-28 01:13:00,26272,Some good size fish out of there! Thanks for the report!!!  What's the eating guide say about St. John these days?
154687,Greencoachdog,2008-01-28 01:14:00,8163,Great report and pics!!! Beauty fish too!!!  What were they hittin'?
154689,huntervasili,2008-01-28 01:21:00,1604,Nice Fish! looks like ya had a great time on the Ice
154706,fishindevil,2008-01-28 02:07:00,6254,"Awesome catch...great looking walleyes man,  nice pictures too !!!!"
154712,mbac31,2008-01-28 02:21:00,904,They were hitting a pink/orange  1/4 oz HILDEBRANDT THINGAMA JIG.  I have found these to be awesome for walleye lately. Modified to hold a single hook instead of the treble. Walleye love these things.
154722,pikehunter,2008-01-28 03:00:00,1659,Glad to see someone has luck on St. John.  We've been there in the warm season and never had such good fortune. Very well done and a great set of pictures!
154724,fatherof3,2008-01-28 03:02:00,1769,congrats on a good outing
154725,FishFinder,2008-01-28 03:08:00,481,I thought they werent good to eat because of the chemical plant. Each to their own
154728,irishfield,2008-01-28 03:18:00,26272,"Found my guide...shows they are good for 8 meals a month up to 22"" in size (4 meals for kids and child bearing women)."
154734,CRAPPIE,2008-01-28 03:56:00,213,"Nice catch, do i have to walk a long way or I just park my car and how far I have to walk, I have bad back and cannot walk too far, and how deep is the water . I been in Orilla and fish in downtown but where is lake st john,  I want a general location and I am not asking for good spot.  Thanks in advance"
154741,mbac31,2008-01-28 04:39:00,904,"I get my water tested twice a year from my cottage and last year we had the water from lake St John tested and you would be surprised how clean the water is now. Domtar is not there anymore, its called Stephan now and its just soap.  Most people dont have that much luck there. That lake is like a minature rice lake."
154757,medmart,2008-01-28 09:22:00,587,Good catch guys looks like a good day  rob
154762,Blake,2008-01-28 11:58:00,418,Great report and pics buddy.  Fishing World just reduced all their gas augers if you are in need.
154772,Gerritt,2008-01-28 12:26:00,6129,Lake St. John can be accessed from off of Rama Rd. Or off of Airport rd.  The factory located on the  lake is in fact a Soap Plant.  I grew up fishing St.John and have spent alot of memorable time there. Those walters are Beauties!  Glad you had a good outing!  I should stop by and see if my grandparents property still looks the same.... (they were located directly across from the factory. There were 3 small cabins on the property)  G
154777,b2kptbo,2008-01-28 12:37:00,1505,Beauty...
154914,misfish,2008-01-28 21:25:00,29133,"Some FYI,Did you know there is a slot size there now?  Nice fish"
154918,Moosebunk,2008-01-28 21:43:00,3970, Some nice size eyes for what looks like a busy lake.  Walleye aren't often tested for chemicals.  Being a coarse fish they don't tend to retain them in their flesh. (unlike fatty fish such as trout or salmon)  Mercury on the other hand....
154931,jeffw,2008-01-28 22:43:00,267,Thanks for posting the report smalliefisher. I ate one last night and they tasted just as good as the one's out of Sturgeon. Misfish we were aloud 1 fish each over 18 and there was two of us fishing with only two taken home so in other words we weren't poaching. Cheers Jeff
154934,Gerritt,2008-01-28 22:45:00,6129,I dont think the intent of Brian's reply to this post was to insinuate that you were poaching.  G
154956,misfish,2008-01-28 23:36:00,29133," Thanks G.  No intent to say you were pouching here,just a heads up on the new regs Jeff."
154957,douG,2008-01-28 23:36:00,2693,Was too.  Hope this hleps.
154960,mbac31,2008-01-28 23:40:00,904,"Thanks, Yes I'm aware there is a slot size there now. Its about time. However there are not alot of walleye taken out of that lake each year. Thats my 3rd walleye taken home from that lake in 16 years. I only keep them if one of my friends wants one. I hate the taste of them. Spoiled  from eating saltwater fish from the east coast I guess, have not been able to get hooked on their taste.  Most fish here taste like bog. LOL. Except for crappie and Smallmouth."
154971,Rizzo,2008-01-29 00:26:00,4754," my sentiments exactly.  Freshwater fish taste pretty much like dirt to me.  Even walleyes get a ""get out of jail free"" card in my boat!  Nice walleye's by the way out of St. John.  I was also unaware there was a slot there...but when you don't keep any fish its not really on your mind!"
155325,jeffw,2008-01-29 16:50:00,267,Sorry to jump the gun I thought you were saying that I was commiting a crime. I very rarely keep bigger fish as the bigger ones have a tougher flesh. Cheers jeff
