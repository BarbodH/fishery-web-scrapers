156400,Want,2008-02-01 20:19:00,39,"I throw a lot of Mepps size 5 bucktails and 6 and 7 sized spinnerbaits on traditional Muskie reels: (C3's,  Calcutta etc. but all retrieve ""right"".  So I'm thinking about getting a leftie. The main gears of the 301 are apparently a bit bigger than a Shimano Tiagra 80 saltwater reel and that should mean a lot of torque (or so goes the ad copy). My concern is that the IPT is 28"" at 6.2:1. That seems kind of fast for blade bates around size 5 and up.  Really would like hearing from somebody who has actually used this reel for bucktails and spinnerbaits. Thanks."

Don`t know about durability of aluminum gears if so and not enough time out for them for others to know probably."

156455,PAZE,2008-02-01 22:55:00,132,"Bar none hands down the best reel on the market (in my opinon) for musky, these babies were made to take a beating, and the price, at around $250 how can you go wrong."
156457,Want,2008-02-01 23:05:00,39,"Thanks for the answers guys. Yep, with the $50 Rebate coupon, it's a pretty tempting offer. I never could refuse rebates anyway."
