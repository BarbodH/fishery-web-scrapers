My question is, why does Trombley's in Orillia sell a R/C fishing boat and yes there is a pic of a kid fishing with it and there is a place to attach the line and to top it all off an employee said it was legal.  I'm confused, I thought that was totally illegal:wallbash:  Daniel OCH"

156131,forrest,2008-01-31 22:17:00,1032,OK...I will bite:  If it is illegal it makes perfect sense:  1)  Boat motor dies....no way to retrieve caught fish 2)  Boat motor is overpowered by fish.....no way to retrieve fish  forrest

156151,Greencoachdog,2008-01-31 23:51:00,8163,"As long as that is the only line being tended by the angler, I don't really see it being illegal."
156157,HTHM,2008-02-01 00:10:00,4082,Legal or not I thought it was COOL! Not smart but cool.
156183,Ryan Landry,2008-02-01 01:56:00,128,"I personally think it's illegal, based solely on the fact that it's looks extremely fun.  Extremely fun = Illegal   (most of the time)  Ryan"
156265,OhioFisherman,2008-02-01 08:08:00,6623,"Just my view is it should be illegal, for some of the reasons I am not down with people jug fishing. Jug drifts and you can`t recover it, a death sentence for the fish on the jug, or one that may take the bait later. Fish on a broken line may be able to catch food, fish trying to pull a jug and catch food? a death sentence and probably a wasted fish.  Same deal with the boat, loses power, loss of signal, breakdown= dead fish? One thing to accidently lose fish,or have one die on you while fishing for them, but while playing? Take the resource seriously."
