152636,Sudsmaster,2008-01-21 03:59:00,29,"Lake Rosseau had 4-6"" of black ice with a layer of snow on it about 5-8"" deep on Sat morning in the Village of Windermere (north east side of the lake) ...we walked out about 50 yards from shore in 62' of water and the fishing was great ...I travelled around the local area today and huts are now starting to be moved out onto the lake via snowmobile at the end of Dawson Rd and over on Pottage bay on Brackenrig Rd.  The main part of the lake has just refrozen as it all broke up with that wind storm so ice travel with machine requires caution ....I'm putting my perm hut out on the lake tomorrow in Windermere...as for the west side of the lake you would have to check with the locals over there.
