156711,Moosebunk,2008-02-02 21:58:00,3970,"Thanks for the interest and info.  It would be a cool opp for a meet and greet granted if people go the distance.  Myself, I am travelling up with a friend in his vehicle towing his boat.  We have invites out to a few others now for a third friend to join us but may just end up going with 2 because of my/our questionable departure time, and, it's my buddies ride and boat so I'm not really the boss. lol.  I can't speak on behalf of both of us, but if a day or night gets planned for a M&G swill and/or fish, well, I'll be doing my darndest to try and be there.  Fish ON DOODS!!!"
156721,irishfield,2008-02-02 22:23:00,26272,420 statute miles by air from the dock......fuel stop in Marathon...... Dan's secret bay is 580 feet long...... so I get one shot at it! LOL  You make a good point though Bunk... boat space for some that may just DROP in !
156749,TroutnMuskieHunter,2008-02-03 00:09:00,1362,Looking forward to your report as always and will be curious what flies ya used and what worked on Nipigon....
156753,danc,2008-02-03 00:32:00,4677," You'd never land in that bay Wayne. That's just the camping/mooring spot. But as you can see, you have 80 miles of lake outside of that bay to land.  Also, I regret that I can't take all comers on this venture. Moosebunk and I have been talking about this few a few years at least. Someday I hope to get up to his neck of the woods. But first he's coming to mine. Spiel and I are good friends. He's welcome anytime. Same with Wayne. I simply can't take anyone that just signs on to this thread. Sorry guys, but this isn't Lakair that we're talking about. The locals would probably kill me if I brought an entire mob of you guys there. And I wouldn't blame them."
156759,irishfield,2008-02-03 00:48:00,26272, You might be surprised ! I ain't flyin no Cessna!  Already got Leah working on a girls week... to up the percentage chance of my participation.
156765,danc,2008-02-03 01:02:00,4677," Unless you're flying an ultralight, you'll never do it Wayne. I'll have my camcorder ready when you attempt it."
156217,bucktail,2008-02-01 03:03:00,1857,"Thinking of heading up as well, count me in if you need an extra guy."
156221,danc,2008-02-01 03:28:00,4677,"If we can get a swill on the lake together, you're more than welcome Bucktail. I'll pm you if anything develops."
156226,Moosebunk,2008-02-01 03:48:00,3970,"I'm in for boozing.  Gotta get there first.  My buddy I can imagine would be up for it, if not... I am. hehe.  Dates are 18th - 26th for us.  Ohhh yeah... I'll be the smelly guy curled up under a tree by some lake access somewhere. lol."
156234,irishfield,2008-02-01 04:29:00,26272,August..right Drew?  Dan.. is there a well sheltered bay to land and moor a floatplane?  Maybe I can arrange for that to be Leah's gal week at the lake and I'll leave!  I'll need co-ords ! Drew has my cottage phone number.
156252,danc,2008-02-01 05:11:00,4677," There is a well sheltered bay to land on, depending on the wind direction Wayne. I'll send you some co-ords in a day or two so that you can check it out for yourself. It would be great to have you there."
156255,irishfield,2008-02-01 05:15:00,26272,"Thanks Dan.. I don't need much room, just something 2000 feet or more into the prevailing wind and minimal waves."
156263,scuro,2008-02-01 06:32:00,386,"http://www.mccollumsresort.com/resort.htm  It might be the only place on that huge lake where you can rent cabins or a room. There was another place close by but I believe that business is closed. They wanted to rent only by the week but I think they would be accommodating late August when there is little business and most families are getting ready for school. They have a dock and water access to the main lake. Nice people, clean cabins.  Drew, that is HUGE water...I thought you were a river rat."
156275,TroutnMuskieHunter,2008-02-01 11:38:00,1362,I'd be interested in headin' up as well!!
156279,TroutnMuskieHunter,2008-02-01 12:13:00,1362," Drew, here's a great link on fly tying with step-by-step instructions and pictures...My favorites are the Muddler, Sculpin Woolhead Bunny and the Crystal Egg Wooly Bugger.....Once you open the link you can scoll down and open the home page for more fly patterns...these flies have produced some really nice trout for me  http://www.akflyfishers.com/fom_muddler_minnow.html  Steve"
156316,PIKEMAN330,2008-02-01 15:58:00,10,"We went to Nipigon last August to Pike fish.The main lake was still too warm for Pike in the bay and we did not feel confident to travel very far out on the main lake.walleye fishing on the river by the camp was very good.We fished a back lake,with the owners boat.This was a very nice lake for both pike and eyes. The owner has two large boats for charters.The cabin we stwyed in was outstanding.I have made over thirty trips over forty-three years and this was the nicest cabin I have ever stayed in.The owners and his father are very good honest people and very enjoyable to be around.We are going back this year early June.For us it is 1260 miles one way. Onamanriverresort.com      phone 807 879 2508      Good Fishing, Pikeman"
156651,bucktail,2008-02-02 15:17:00,1857,Dan!!!  Please keep me in mind. I have 6 weeks vacation this year! Only lake where I can beat my PB 30# pike with a 40#!
156683,wuchikubo,2008-02-02 18:07:00,1114,"MB et al, I've never been up that way for fishing and would like to give it a go as well, space permitting. With this much of a notice, I'll be able to work something into the schedule. Please let me know if it's possible.  Stan"
