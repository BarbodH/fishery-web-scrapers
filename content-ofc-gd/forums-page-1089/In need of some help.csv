153064,motv8tr,2008-01-22 14:12:00,2587,"Good morning all, last year a butcher in Lindsay I believe gave us 150 sausages at his cost...100.00, not a bad deal at all.  I believe three members of the board contibuted to their purchase.  This year I'm looking for some help in getting those sausages again....they were very popular, and very tasty   While I will try to get confirmation on the price, is anyone willing and able to help pay for them???  Thanks Maureen"
153228,douG,2008-01-22 20:38:00,2693,"Yup, put me down for some, Maureen.  PM me with the details."
153266,wuchikubo,2008-01-22 22:10:00,1114,"Maureen, you can put me down for it as well.  PM me the details too."
153314,vance,2008-01-22 23:41:00,719,I will give something too just give me a PM  vance
153348,motv8tr,2008-01-23 01:23:00,2587,Thanks guys I really appreciat that.  Cliff is going to check with the butcher on the price and let me know...as soon as I know I'll forward it on to you.  Thanks again so much  Maureen
153636,Big Cliff,2008-01-23 23:15:00,6899,"I talked with Len and Patty Thurston today (the butcher shop that helped us out last year) and they are pleased to help us again this year, they are a small shop so they can't afford to just donate it to us but will give us what ever we need at their cost. Anyone that had one will tell you how good they were.  I asked them for 50 honey Garlic and 50 Italian saussages and they will call me tomorrow when they have worked everything out. Last year we got about 140 saussages and had some left over which we auctioned off so nothing got wasted. This year I figured if we went short on them everyone would be willing to pay more just to get one LOL (not really, just don't want to get more than we need.)  Anyway, I should know more tomorrow and will post then."
153650,John,2008-01-23 23:29:00,2956,"Cliff,  I would be pleased to put in $100 towards the ""food and refreshments"". Use it as you see fit. Let me know whether to send it to you or to Mo.  Cheers,  John..."
153665,Clampet,2008-01-23 23:51:00,1947,"  Golly gee, Miss Maureen, Pa says it's an awfull pity he ain't got no sausages, but a big ole mess a possum stew and homemade beens ( No offence BEANS).  "
153669,camillj,2008-01-23 23:55:00,1988,"Mo, let me know if you still need help ... I'm there for $100"
153675,Big Cliff,2008-01-24 00:05:00,6899,"The generosity of the members of OFC never ceases to amaze me. let me find out what the sausages are going to cost us and I'll post it on here. I suspect it will be less than the $100.00 but wait until I have the final numbers in. Any money goes directly through Moe as she is the coordinator. I am also going to try to see if we can get some nice big saussage buns donated from the local bakery, I'll be talking to them tomorrow!"
153694,motv8tr,2008-01-24 00:29:00,2587,You folks are AMAZING!!!! I am truly Verklempt  Maureen
153699,douG,2008-01-24 00:40:00,2693,"Attagirl, moe.  You rock on this stuff, and shame me by your commitment and drive.  It is the very least I can do to support you.  God Bless."
153747,Loonietoon,2008-01-24 01:50:00,1450,"Cliff... I will be in touch with Weston Bakery again all as I need is a count so I know what to ask for... Sausage , Burger & hot dog Buns... Just need a count.. so let me know ASAP"
153761,Big Cliff,2008-01-24 02:07:00,6899,You got it my friend! Should have an answer tomorrow.
155909,Loonietoon,2008-01-31 01:53:00,1450,Mo.. Got off the Phone today with Weston Bakeries.. Spoke with my contact.. Sent the letter over by Fax... Called her back...

155930,John,2008-01-31 02:54:00,2956,Mo please can you PM me your address and I will mail you a cheque.  John
155966,Big Cliff,2008-01-31 11:15:00,6899,"Called the butcher shop again yesterday and again they promised to get right back to me, if I haven heard back from them today I am going to go and see another butcher here in town and see if they can help us out."
156006,tonyb,2008-01-31 14:45:00,1637,Do you guys still want the pre-cooked Chicken?  I thought it was just going to be the sausages???  Let me know. Tony
156044,motv8tr,2008-01-31 16:35:00,2587,"Hey Tony, I thought I sent you a PM about that.  Yes I'd still like the chicken, I can make use of what doesn't get eaten at the event, and I think I found a way to keep it from getting too dry   i hope  Thanks, Maureen"
156046,wuchikubo,2008-01-31 16:50:00,1114,"Maureen,  I haven't received your PM yet, please resend if you did.  Stan"
156053,motv8tr,2008-01-31 17:24:00,2587,"Hey Stan, no I didn't send you the details, as Cliff said, he's having difficulty pinning down a price this year...will let you know.  Thanks Maureen"
156059,tonyb,2008-01-31 17:37:00,1637," Ok, I'll look into it...I think the problem last year was that they remained on heat the whole day.  It is better to just heat them as they are requested, shouldn't take too long on a hot grill since they are already completely cooked."
156078,Big Cliff,2008-01-31 18:50:00,6899,"Ok, just heard back from the butcher shop and they will supply us with the saussages at cost again this year. We are only getting 100, 50 honey garlic and 50 Italian as we had some left over last year. Cost is $60.00 including tax.  Hope this helps.  Cliff"
