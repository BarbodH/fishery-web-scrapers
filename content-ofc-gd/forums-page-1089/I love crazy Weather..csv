Again the main intersection coming into dover at the cross roads was all blocked off as the water levels had yet again reached way up by main. I decided to take a drive down this morning and shoot this video footage.  Great big slabs of ice all over the roads and side walk.  The wind is just incredible and the whole pier is just one thick blanket of ice.  If you watch on the video you will see the end of the peir is all burried under one big huge chunk of ice. Never seen that before.  Still crazy high gusts of winds here in dover which started up around 3.00am here. Anyway enjoy the video.  "
