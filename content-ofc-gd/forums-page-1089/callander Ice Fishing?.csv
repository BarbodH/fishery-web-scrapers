If you are fishing at night you will almost certainly pick up the odd mudpuppy for your efforts.  What to use is a matter of persoanl preference.  Small jigs and jigheads are popular as are jigging spoon in various colors, shapes and sizes.  Most people tip their bait of choice with a minnow, especially during the slower mid-day stretches.  If the weather permits, don't be afraid to ask your operator to punch you a few holes outside away from your hut.  You would be amazed what gets dropped down some of those inside holes after a couple of weeks on the same spot.  Cheers and good luck  Look forward to the report.  Craig"

He was a really nice guy, and was very friendly and outgoing. We spent 8 hours on the ice, nothing was biting. Tried spoons, and jigheads w/minnows.  All we caught last weekend were two perch. The other huts around us had the same luck, although one guy in the morning caught a pike closer to shore.  Although the fishing was poor, we still had a great time and a nice boys weekend away from the wives."
