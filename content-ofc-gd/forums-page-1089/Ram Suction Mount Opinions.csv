156104,Uncle Buck,2008-01-31 20:56:00,1000,"thinking about picking this up for the GPS    I plan on using it in the car and on the boat...  anyone have any opinions or experience with the suction mount?  does it hold well, does it not?"
156107,irishfield,2008-01-31 20:58:00,26272,I think if you find the Ram thread Gerritt started.. that's exactly what DanC has on his Lund windshield in a picture.
156114,Uncle Buck,2008-01-31 21:22:00,1000,"indeed, you're right Wayne  "
156149,Deano,2008-01-31 23:40:00,767,"I use one also, excellent mounts, no vibrations. I always remove it when not in use. Not good to leave on the windshield for days, especially in the hot sun, it'll almost melt to the windshield. Have mine for over a year and it still works great."
156314,cork soaker,2008-02-01 15:15:00,23,you could cat burgal up the side of a glass building with those things.  i have one and its holding power is incredible.  buy with confidence.
156315,danc,2008-02-01 15:20:00,4677, That's exactly what I use mine for UB. It really is a great product. I can't think of anything negative to say about it. Go for it.
