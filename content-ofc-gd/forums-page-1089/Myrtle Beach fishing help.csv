I told him I'll try to get some info on the fishing around there this time of year for him.  So....can anybody here provide what kind of fishing is available for him and where?  As well, he wanted to bring some tackle and gear with him, what kind of stuff should he bring?  He also has a saltwater spinning reel and rod, is it worth for him to bring that as well?  Anyways, hopefully someone can help out here, would be much appreciated."
156340,Blake,2008-02-01 17:20:00,418,"Most fishing available will be ocean fishing.  His best bet is to gear up for some pier fishing, long rods, braided line in the 30 -40lb range.  He can check areas down by Murrels Inlet and purchase lures, bait and also there are a few Charters available. Hope this helps a bit anyways."
