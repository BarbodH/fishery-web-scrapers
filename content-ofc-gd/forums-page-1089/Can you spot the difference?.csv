156389,Sinker,2008-02-01 19:33:00,8692,Lots of differences.....but I think there is a lighthouse  missing in the first pic?  Sinker
156391,nautifish,2008-02-01 19:35:00,1416,"   oooo i hate smarty pants....LOL......I knew that 1st pic was to easy....lol.....I should have made it more busy busy....lol  Yes the other lighthouse ,belltower on the east pier was swept away by wednesday storm.  Incredible!"
156392,Sinker,2008-02-01 19:38:00,8692,"Yup, that was some wind we had......looks like there was lots of ice with it out your way.....amazing how much power mother nature has......that ice looks like it was pretty solid at one point!!  Sinker"
156393,nautifish,2008-02-01 19:43:00,1416,"It was sinker.  All the way out lots of ice, I think i have a shot over on the photograpghy board that shows  some of the huge slabs of ice that were washed up against the break wall. They were out with a bulldozer yesterday clearing off all the ice from the east pier.  Not sure what they are foing to do about the main peir. Its pretty dangerous as it is right now.  They're were actually young kids up there yesterday by the edge throwing chunks of ice off the pier."
156497,Sandbag,2008-02-02 00:22:00,533,I had also heard that the tower was taken down by the storm.  Then I read on another board that the tower was removed the day before the storm by a contractor as planned well before the storm.   Cheers  Craig
