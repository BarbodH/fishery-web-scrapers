We do not live in a Puritanical society and most of us Heathens take a pretty dim view of them trying to ram their beliefs down our throat.  Kids are gonna hear it and they're gonna say it too! I don't speak much different now than when I was a kid, all my friends and the other kids in school spoke that way too.  Sure I got my mouth washed out with soap when I was a kid, and it taught me a lesson... never cuss when grown-ups can hear you.  What do you think kids are looking for today on the internet? A fishing message board where they might see a cuus word? I don't think so. I'll bet big money they're lookin' at lots worse stuff than that!!!... they're on Youtube watchin South Park and Jay and Silent Bob clips  Walt Disney is dead."

I tend to talk like a trucker at work, but watch it around my sons.  The oldest is pretty quick to point out bad words.  I don't get too wound up if people drop a couple bad words around my kids, it happens and the oldest knows adults swear sometimes. We were in a restaurant one day and the kids behind us were very loud and very profane, dropping the dreaded C word about some girls they knew.  I asked them to have a little respect for the fact that I was sitting there with my family, and they did, grudgingly. I'm no angel either, I dropped the F bomb in front of my sergeants young daughters at work one day, that can make for a bad day."
156824,Photoz,2008-02-03 11:40:00,792,"Although most people kinda know what to expect around areas where a lot of anglers congregate in the wee hours, like an hour BEFORE daylight  . .     boat ramps, access points to the ice etc., and if they're offended, they can just avoid it! BUT, there are certain groups who CANNOT avoid it . . . . .    that DO have some clout if the foul language (and OTHER boorish behavior) prevails every Saturday & Sunday morning at the end of their driveways . . . . .    they're called RESIDENTS . . . . .    when this finally gets to a point where  a whole neighbourhood is woken up to this, every weekend, they band together & have bylaws passed . . .    'NO PARKING,' 'NO STOPPING,' 'NO FISHING,' etc., that generally takes care of the problem. I know it's not ONLY the loud & obnoxious language (guys just wanna have fun, eh?) it also the litter & yellow snowbanks at the end of their driveways too . . . .   Lake Simcoe, Cook Bay & Couchiching are areas where less & less parking or access is being allowed every year . . ...    people being loud, rude & vulgar, and upsetting those who live there have a lot of bearing on this.

When women swear in casual conversation for some reason it bothers me more than when guys do it.  Wierd, or does anyone else feel that way too???"
156850,SlowPoke,2008-02-03 14:39:00,2984," Complete turn off. If you think that's weird... I was also turned off by women walking and smoking - way back when smoking was acceptable!  Back to the language issue... Anyone that knows me can probably atest to me stringing together a sentance that would make George Carlin blush. If I'm in mixed company or around youngins/teens, I turn off the language instictivley.  My wife and I run a pretty strict house regarding language and kids (girls 12&9). Most acceptable language doesn't fly in our house.... ""Shoot, damn, fudge, crap etc."" - NOT ACCEPTABLE! These are just replacements for foul language. ""Stupid, idiot, shut-up,  etc."" - NOT ACCEPTABLE! These are demeaning and disrespectful.  I'm not so naive to think I've sheltered my kids from inappropriate language and frankly, I don't care what language they use around thier friends. I just want them to know that it's inappropriate to use that language around us, elders and in public.  The real payoff for us is when we hear ""your kids are so... polite ...respectful...well behaved etc."" from teachers, family members or complete strangers. They do us proud.  While in public, I think it's reasonable to expect good behaviour/language especially from adults. It's not always observed and when faced with poor behaviour I'll either remove ourselves from the situation or explain to my kids that people like that have little respect for those around them.   I have a question for those responding in the thread... not to single anyone out but I'll use the example of ""if I'm fishing a spot and someone pulls up beside us...""  If you are in line at a coffee shop with a buddy or co-worker and you're telling a story with explicit situations or language and a family comes in and is waiting inline behind you, what would you do?  a ) stop talking about it ""I'll tell you later"" b ) lower your voice c ) continue expressing your right to speek freely"

156628,Canuck2fan,2008-02-02 14:38:00,1444, I have to agree with that 100%.... Too often the rights of loud ones are looked at more important than the rights of the silent majority these days.

I'll admit though, I'm much more careful around other people and children than I am with my own daughter. Just the way I was raised, my parents and family swore in front of me my entire life, and I'll tell you something, my brother and I were probably two of the most polite, respectable children around.  Just because my parents swore in front of me doesn't mean they didn't instill the proper values, or a sense of respect for other people and their religion or race.  cheers"
156689,Jen,2008-02-02 18:57:00,833,"Being a woman in a mans world more often than not I have found just the opposite.  Most men have amazing vocabularies, wives, women, children around or not.  Yes there is the odd time when ""inappropriate to some"" words flow, however in most circumstances it is only in a small group of people.  I have never experienced someone being asked to watch their language being disrespectful and not doing just that.  Occationally people need to be made aware of voice levels but mostly human nature is to be appropriate in all situations.  There is a time and a place and most of the wonderful people I have had the opportunity to meet know just that.  This weekend I probably crossed paths with 100 fishermen, and not one of them was rude... now that says a whole heck of a lot.  Good luck seeing that from anyone in Wal Mart at Christmast time!

I suspect most do their best.  - It's also common sense to keep your kids away from being exposed to those situations - that's being a parent.  I've been accosted before by someone who had her 14 year join in a guys football party. We did our best but come on - men, football, mountains of beer - what did you expect, English pleasantries?  - If it's unavoidable - and I would suggest most situations are avoidable - speak up.  At the end of the day, when you consider all the stuff kids are exposed to now a days via TV or the school yard, running into a couple of fishing louts is probably insignificant - I wouldn't spend too much time worrying about it..."

Dunno, maybe its just me, but the way people are raised surely influences their conduct anywhere, anytime.  I'm sure there are many words that many people dont consider ""bad""...but others do??!!??   I can't say I'll go out of my way to ""watch my mouth"", but when someones got a problem with it, and they mention that, its not hard to compensate for them.  Really, it cant be expected that everyone is like everyone else, or that anyone knows anyone else is offended by language being used.  I think if you've got a problem with it, you best speak up or move along....its everyones world, and we're all different!!

I lack discipline and swear in front of my own son sometimes. But I don't toss around curses in front of my brothers kids or strangers kids. Why? Because it's completely disrespectful, not only of the kids but of their father or mother who decides what is considered appropriate language for them.  You wouldn't cuss and swear in the presence of a group of old people because common sense tells you it's inappropriate and disrespectful.  Should be the same for kids.
