On Saturday, Marty is heading up that way and can grab them from anywhere near the 407...his son desperately wants one. I work Saturday, so cannot meet him. So if I can meet up with anyone tomorrow or Wednesday that is going to be in either of those two places and is willing to hold on to these for Marty, I also have an extra cut out for them! Use them as a boat buddy, fake person for the diamond lane or for paintball practise (lol)."
