485189,pikehunter,2010-07-14 02:22:00,1659,"Went to Port Dover today....the long way, via Brantford along the back roads to Simcoe and then eventually over to Port Dover. We had intended to visit the TSC Store to fetch me a new pair of work shoes as this is the only place I have found steel toe shoes that will fit my fat feet. Then hit the casino for a short spell and finally head to the port for a foot long at the Arbour.  As fate turned out we did win a few bucks   at the slots but they ever had my size of shoes in stock at the store so we did some country jumpin' along the back roads enjoying the day and ended up going through Simcoe. As we were leaving town we passed a BBQ Smokehouse! What luck! It was a real honest to goodness smokehouse, real life smoker and great beer to boot! Woooo hoooooo! Happy days!  The place was just like something out of the South! Board and batten siding, motorcycle parking and wild game heads on the walls, even a Harley parked inside! My kind of place, I knew it as soon as I pulled into the parking lot...the smell of a smoker BBQ filling the air.  Damn, there were even live chickens roaming around the front yard of the attached house!  Anyway, back to the reason why the lil' lady and I dropped in. The food! We both could not resist a pulled pork on a bun which came with coleslaw, corn fritter and fries! What a delicacy We both thought we had died and went to heaven!   Or at least somehow instantly transported back down to Florida to Sonny's BBQ or such.  The name, (and I'm not trying to spam here, just passing along what I think is worthwhile to all as I am still high on the memory of lunch.) Is the Dogsnest Smokehouse. Some of you may even remember the corner just out side of Port Dover that was once called Dogsnest. When I was a teenager I always did intend to stop one night and grab that sign for my recroom but never did, was always to fall down drunk I guess to hold a screwdriver in the dark.  Apologies for the novel, but I'm still enthralled with from being overstuffed from lunch. They do have a website which I glanced at but it just won't let you go, I had to shut the internet off to escape it so I won't link it but you can google it. If you love BBq smokehouse food ya gotta try it if you are passing through Simcoe and try it I hope you have as good a meal as we did.  Oh yeah...we never did get a foot long dog today, the smokehouse did us in."
