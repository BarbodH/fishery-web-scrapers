Great fun hauling my boat in with the ATVs, only got stuck 3 times.  Fishing was average, but i outfished my buddy Chuck for a change and we had some banter about that all afternoon which is always fun. Mel scored a couple of nice eaters too, the wind was up but the sun was out.  Water temps at the surface in the 70 - 74 degree range, Wind NW 20kmh+, sun and clouds but hazy with forest fire smoke.  The bigger fish we found were consistently relating to the drop offs from weed lines in 16'-18' FOW. The smaller fish were in the weeds, especially in one spot where there was considerable current at the mouth of a creek. The pike were friggin everywhere as per usual...lol.
