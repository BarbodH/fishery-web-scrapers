484870,WeedLine,2010-07-13 02:49:00,322,Shimano Castaic. You can engage the reel by pushing the thumb bar up. I also use it for casting smaller musky/pike plastics.

484915,mbac31,2010-07-13 11:49:00,904,I use all Daiwa TD-Z 103hl - 105hl reels for flippin. Very smooth.
484921,LucG,2010-07-13 12:15:00,779, I got this reel and paired it with a 7'MH St.Crois Mojo Bass rod and I love it. I barely want to put it down.
