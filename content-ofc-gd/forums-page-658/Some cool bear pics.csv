484651,chickenhawk,2010-07-12 15:38:00,612,"lol yep, had to set the bear trap here the other night, i seen em walking around the front boardwalk of the lodge so i went and set the trap in front of the garbage shed with some honey, corn syrup, cinnamon buns, etc. bout 45 minutes later we had a 150 pounder in the trap, turned him loose the next day bout 20 miles from camp, havent seen him since so hopefully he learned his lesson cuz his next visit won't be as nice for him....lol neat pics, i got a video on my camera of the release, but its gonna take me a long time to get all my photos and videos together to do a report, lol so expect a full report somewhere around january or february. haha take care guys don't forget, although bears are neat and sometimes cute, they are still very very dangerous, never trust a bear, be safe out there.

484221,smally21,2010-07-11 01:13:00,993,"great pics - thanks for sharing them. its cool how little bears look just like big bears, only smaller.  we saw a couple coming out of north bay a couple of years ago, couldn't cross the jersey barrier.  so my crazy buddy gets out and heaves them one at a time over the barrier to their mother!"
484230,fishing n autograph,2010-07-11 01:43:00,2540,cool pics...i've never seen a bear in the wild....but are they supposed to be that mangy?(sp?)

484264,alexcba,2010-07-11 07:56:00,634,"there could be a garbage dump close by that they get into and toss around in the stuff. this happened at moonstone a few years back.. the bears got into the fenced off cottage dump and just rolled around and ate everthing they could. by the end of it their fur was soaked in garbage, you could smell them from a mile away. and they just plain looked sick."
484286,Teressa,2010-07-11 11:56:00,55,"Very nice pics T.J.  Last year we had to put food out just so the bears would stop trying to get at my rabbits, wild turkeys ect. I got this pic, hope you don't mind my sharing it  here. Everyone that sees it is surprised that the 2 rabbits are that close to him and he doesn't care. "

484295,oxcowboy,2010-07-11 13:08:00,544,"alex there is a dump near that area, so you maybe on to something.  also having 4 cubs is pretty unusual for a sow(momma) to have so there may be some stunting of the growth curve a bit.  very cool pics.   jason"
