Conmsumers who purchase an eligible Evinrude E-TEC outboard engine between July 12 and September 6, 2010, will qualify for a five-year BRP factory-backed limited warranty (three-year factory warranty plus an additional two-year B.E.S.T. coverage) on eligible 25-hp and higher engines.  BRP ran this promo through the spring of this year, and got a strong enough response to justify continuing it till the 2011 product arrives. If you're in the market for an E-TEC, this would be a good time to buy."
