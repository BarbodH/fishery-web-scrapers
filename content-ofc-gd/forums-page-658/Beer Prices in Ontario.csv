485193,pikehunter,2010-07-14 02:28:00,1659, Gee I kind of like Old Mill beer. Didn't think it was bad for that ponypiss the yanks try to call beer. wink wink nudge nudge

484745,jediangler,2010-07-12 20:04:00,1923,I bought a 6pack of Old Mill at the Ramada across from MLG during the beer strike and paid $22. That stands as the most ripped off I've ever been.
484763,DRIFTER_016,2010-07-12 20:56:00,10439,  You want to feel ripped off on a daily basis move to the NWT!!! We are being hosed $64 for a two four. I don't drink much any more.
484773,Billy Bob,2010-07-12 21:41:00,5865, Dude......you need to set a side some fishing time for brewing time...at those prices you could be rich overnight...
484949,Nipfisher,2010-07-13 13:40:00,2449,Billy Bob this discussion is moot. Your $16 case of beer at 3% - 3.5% is almost equal to or $38 case at 5%. About 15 years ago me and 2 buddies went down to a country music festival (We-fest) in North Dakota (I think) and when we pulled out of the store (I think it was a Pamida) we had over 100 beer each for 3 days. We ran out on the Sunday afternoon and had to rely on the consession stands for the Sunday night shows. As you can tell by my recollection I can't remeber all the details...maybe it was all the beer...but I think we had a good time. I ended up climbing into the wrong tent and passing out between 2 strangers sleeping in a double bag. They were some pissed when I finally awoke to the dude yelling at me and the girl pulling my hair.   .

I wish I could  do something about the prices you guys pay up there on adult beverages but I don't think they would listen......you need more competition on the retail side other then the ""Beer Store"". Here beer is sold almost everywhere from super markets to drug stores to gas stations."
