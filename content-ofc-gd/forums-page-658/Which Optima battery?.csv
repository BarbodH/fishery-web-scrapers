484846,nodie,2010-07-13 01:34:00,34,Looking to replace a Nautilus battery (crap!!!) that I bought at cnd tire. 2nd battery that leaks acid. Heard Optima blue tops were decent.  Any recommendations? It will be used with a trolling motor (46lbs thrust) and want it to last all day long. Which one is best for this application and are they worth the extra $$ or should I go with a company like Interstate batteries?  Thanks in advance..
