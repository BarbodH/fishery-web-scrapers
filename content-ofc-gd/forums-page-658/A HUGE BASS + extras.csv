484208,Fishing 24/7,2010-07-11 00:46:00,709,In this report lies 4 outting.   first outting.   captains log....... really getting the hang of this flipping thigny.    My brother realy wated to go fishing so ...   your wish is my command.    He lands his first pike of the year on a sweet flip in a cabbage bed.    a nice 7-8 lbs pike i dont remember the weight.......   OH  YEAH i dont weight pike anymore.  for my good actions god himself give me karma and i land this brute of a smallie.    The halo around my head says it all.  These were the 2 biggest of the day.   second outting.  the three stooges.  Mike brakes the ice with a small 1 lbs bass...  but his first of the year on surface.  winds picks up....  when the wind blows.... there she GOES...... buzzbait killer.      this 3.9 lbs bass hit as the lure landed in a grassy shore line around an island.  this was the biggest fish of the day caught by my one and only BRO!  AS we hit a beaver dam  jason and mike get a double header.  not the biggest fish...... but lots of fun and smiles in this one.    I myself... 24/7 never goes down without a fight.  i cast a frog and this brute hit my lure. set the hook and the rest is history.    i love this pose!    after this we called it a day.   third report.   after work madness.  me and my couZ hit ''the'' pike and smallie lake.  bite was slow until i hit a hump.   flip in the crawfish....  set the hook....  BRONZY!!!!    as i reach in the water..... i realize    4.6 lbs  got another 4.3 lbs smallies back to back but no pictures .  the couz can catch BASS!      in this picture you see what lure we are using... no secrets there.. YUM cray bug natural color...very important.  These were the biggest of the day.   fourth outting.  My first nickel of the year.   Hit a Largie lake TODAY.  had high hopes about it.  and the lake did NOT disapoint me.  Set up a worm dinger.  on the first log of the first cast.  BANG!!! 5.6 lbs large mouth BEAST!  praise to mother nature I LOVE YOU!    picking her up.    lifting her out of the water.    THE pose.    THE beast..........  The largies were feeding heavy.    2 back to back 3 lbs bass. one was 3.8 mind you.   We were getting theme by the HANDFULL!    was like boom got one bang got one.   here another one.   got em... double header....... and the bass heaven goes on and ON   till next time!
