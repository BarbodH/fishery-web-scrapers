483862,Photoz,2010-07-09 19:57:00,792,"A few years ago I got into the braided line craze (when it first appeared) and tried it out, the 10 pound knotted up very badly, so I went to the 20, same problem, even the 30 tangled, but not as bad. I then went to the 65 pound (for carp) because of the zebra  mussels where I now fish, they cut even 20 pound mono with ease, but NOT the 65 pound Power Pro? It works fine, and I've hauled in some pretty big frisky carp with it. I also check my guides after and bale almost every fish, no problem . . .   .     YET? When this stuff first hit the market, I heard a quite a few people claim it would eventually cut into the guides . . . .   I actually had this happen while using the 10 pound stuff, it cut a little trench into the bale on one of my Sustains . . . .   which was replaced very quickly by Shimano. (warranty) But . . . .    I know there are a lot of people who use braid, and I've not seen a complaint about this problem in quite some time. This 65 pound stuff is on a helluva good carp rod (12' Tribal) and I don't wish to wreck it. Has anyone who is a regular user of braid, landing big strong fighting fish had any problems with it cutting into your guides? Thank you for your time."
483878,Uncle Buck,2010-07-09 20:28:00,1000,"i've been running pline evolution in 30lb test on my carp rod for 5 years. line feels gross, but lasts forever...  would i buy it again, honestly i don't know... that's how gross it feels!!!  never had any issues using it up at long sault either, where everyone told me 50lb plus or you'll lose the line..."
483882,aplumma,2010-07-09 20:41:00,6896,If you are running the old guides that are only generic metal then you can damage them with heavy fish and lots of time. The ceramic or titanium guides are fine and show no signs of damage after 50 lb plus catfish landed for 3 seasons so far.   Art
483898,mbac31,2010-07-09 21:37:00,904,Its not the line that cuts the guides per say. Its the sand and grit that attaches itself to the line that does the damage. Wash your braid in clean fresh water every once in a while and even the braid wont cut the older guides. I use line conditioner on everything and never have this problem.
483914,Raf,2010-07-09 22:12:00,3495,"no issues here photoz, i use 50-100lb."
483918,Dan668,2010-07-09 22:21:00,1120,"i use braid on every reel, no problems on my guides"
483920,bassjnkie,2010-07-09 22:35:00,1101,I've used PP from 5lb - 65lb and never had a problem.
483941,Muskieman,2010-07-09 23:33:00,2472,  Same  Here..  Randy 
483942,The Urban Fisherman,2010-07-09 23:39:00,2050,"I fish carp with 65lb braid on a 7'6"" crucial and haven't had any trouble yet Photoz... mind you I pretty much lock down the drag and muscle them to the boat so there isn't a whole lot of line going through the guides...."
484203,Photoz,2010-07-11 00:07:00,792,"Well, I think I'm pretty safe then, according to my answers, and the 65 pound is somewhat thicker diameter and I would think less liable to cut into the guides . . .    thanks for the info."
484220,spincast,2010-07-11 01:07:00,3279,spiney fleas in lake O sure like braid - hey frank? I'm sure that was a salmon  
484252,BillsTheBassMan,2010-07-11 03:09:00,932,I wonder if what is ruining your guides is your leader knots perhaps?  Are you using fluoro leader material and tying big knots?  Consistently firing those leader knots through your guides can cause problems for sure.
484256,jace,2010-07-11 04:18:00,472,don't worry about it so much.  just fish however you want to fish and deal with wear on parts after they happen.  if they wear.
484268,Garnet,2010-07-11 10:13:00,2056,Line and guide wear was with some of the first super lines that came out. They were all titanium based lines. All the lines mentioned are spectre lines and will not wear guides.
484283,Billy Bob,2010-07-11 11:52:00,5865," CERAMIC guides ? ? ? I haven't hear about or seen one in over 20 years. Are they still made and used on rods....some of the alloy aluminum oxide guide may look like ceramic but are not. The use of ceramic guides didn't last long because of their weight they added to a rod. Maybe now a cheap Walmart, etc...rod might have ceramic guides on it but like I have said I haven't seen one in MANY years."
484294,dave524,2010-07-11 13:06:00,4508," Think you got ceramic confused with carbide, popular in the 60's for tip tops but too heavy for a whole rod, especially a spinner with the larger diameters. They were a dark grey carbide ring welded to a stainless or chrome metal frame, things were brutal in weight as I replaced a 8 foot saltwater spinner that I used for channel cats with them in the early 70's, rod went from stiff to a noodle with the extra weight."
484580,Spiel,2010-07-12 09:44:00,9065,"   I use ceramic guides on all the rods I build. In fact most every rod out there has ceramic guides.  Here's a description of some of Fuji's popular ceramic guides. http://www.mudhole.c...ur-Catalog/Fuji    Oh and Steve I read on the Shimano site that your ""Tribal"" rod is built with Fuji Titanium SiC guides, you should have no worries."
484600,mepps,2010-07-12 12:22:00,1301,"No issues for me either, used several rods from several price ranges and braid from 10lb to 80lb."
484780,aplumma,2010-07-12 22:06:00,6896,Ceramic is the base material for most of the guides different additives are incorporated to make different versions/grades of guides. I learned this after Chris made me learn what the heck I was ordering on my last few rods he built me.  Thanks for stuffing more information in my head Spiel.  Art
