484587,vince.bornais,2010-07-12 11:00:00,50,"Omar Marine Sales in Barrie does boat covers(705-733-2681). I paid $700 for the cover on my LUND 1775 ProV SE. I use it for trailering, plus I have a cheaper(less than $200) cover from Princess Auto that I use while my boat is in my driveway.  Princess Auto carries 2 different makes of boat covers. They say they are trailerable, but I wouldn't trailer with them. Crappy Tire also carries boat covers, I forget the price(approx $200). If you are going to get a custom cover, make sure you get a good grade of canvas."
484606,Lunkerhunter,2010-07-12 12:46:00,455,i got a custom cover made up for me in the thornhill area. it turned out great and they did it in just a few days. if you want the info just send me over a PM.
484609,greenfshrmn,2010-07-12 13:07:00,65,"if you can afford it, there's no substitute for a custom cover, I think you'd be disappointed with the universal ones.  A good one will probably cost between $500-$800.  Have you priced them from Lund?  I have one on my 17ft Pro Angler and it's excellent."
484610,Chugger,2010-07-12 13:10:00,109,"I got my custom cover made at Falle Marnie systems, but it's up near Huntsville.  They did a great job and i had my boat back in under a week.  It cost me $600.00"

484684,walleyejack,2010-07-12 17:17:00,358,thanks peps i called him..yikes  $650. is what he told me    
484690,Rattletrap2,2010-07-12 17:27:00,1652,"Greg at Covers Unlimited does a fantastic job and like Peps mentioned, it will be done in a day! If he quoted you $650.00, I would think that will be the best you do for a custom made cover."
484761,walleyejack,2010-07-12 20:47:00,358,"sounds good, i will prob make a deal with him. i am off next week so i can drop it out there and get it the next day or so.. thanks for the help  "
