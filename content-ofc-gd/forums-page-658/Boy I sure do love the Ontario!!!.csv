485207,bassmaster4,2010-07-14 03:32:00,801,is anyone else concerned by this?
485210,irishfield,2010-07-14 03:49:00,26272,Yep.. stop the USA/UN from chem spraying now and stop playing God with the weather....
485211,bigugli,2010-07-14 03:50:00,6138,Not as if it has never happened before BM4. We've had snow in early August in the Haliburtons and Muskokas some decades back. Ma Nature just likes to keep things interesting.
485230,cranks bait,2010-07-14 12:21:00,721,I used to live in Jasper.  That is actually pretty normal for out there.  Nothing like going camping for a few days in the mountains and haveing a storm come in.  I loved it.  The weather out there was much more bearable than it is here.
