484585,singingdog,2010-07-12 10:41:00,1047,It used to be up in the convenience store right next to the bridge. Hasn't been there for many years. It was a beauty.

484752,pics,2010-07-12 20:18:00,1268,The video/variety store closed so I'm not sure who would have the original. The city of Kawartha lakes has a replica even though it wasn't caught there. I would ask at the food town across the road or even the gas station....someone must know.The lake is surrounded by private property but there were never many fish in it to begin with....I believe the fish was 9 lbs 13 oz..
