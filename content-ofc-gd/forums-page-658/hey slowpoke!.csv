485012,alexcba,2010-07-13 17:04:00,634,LOL!
485026,SlowPoke,2010-07-13 18:26:00,2984,"Sure, and how many inches do you want for the rare ""shelled panfish"" in the background?"
485059,grt1,2010-07-13 20:20:00,638,"thats a good one,, I missed that ""rare breed"" I didn't get close enough to measure but I guess we'll take 7 inches. I suppose you could check with my team captain to see if he'll go along with that guestimate.  Just thought I'd brighten your day LOL"
