484782,JohnF,2010-07-12 22:12:00,3494,I grew a vegetable once. All the rest died.  JF
483977,Leecher,2010-07-10 01:21:00,7832,"Mid July is the time for harvesting garlic and that's just what I did this afternoon.... The easy part about it is yanking the plants out of the ground, what follows is the longest.... cleaning.  Here I am in the cleaning process    All nice and clean    Crop to be dried a couple of weeks    I will keep a few of the bigger ones for planting this coming October and the rest, once dried will be sent into the food processor and mixed into olive oil, packaged into cubes for the freezer.  I also harvested a few sweet peppers today.... here's a shot    Tomatoes are doing great in this hot sizzling weather... here's a shot of my biggest plants (left is a Monte Carlo and right is Oxheart)    Lots of small fruits on the plant already.... a couple of shots  Monte Carlo   Oxheart   Cherry tomato.... lots of flowers on it    Green sweet peppers    Yellow wax beans    and last but not least.... cucumbers    Hope you enjoyed the tour Tight lines Leechman"
483984,Mike Pike,2010-07-10 01:41:00,1332,"Wow, nice yeild Leechamn.  Your garlic is HUGE.  Nice green peppers too, I never have nice ones like that myself.  Bet your salads at your place are awesome!"
483986,bigugli,2010-07-10 01:42:00,6138,This hot weather will really bring on the maters and peppers. Be sure to give them some extra feed weekly. It makes a big difference.
483987,JohnF,2010-07-10 01:44:00,3494, I'm envious. I'm lucky to grow dandelions.  JF
483989,Daplumma,2010-07-10 01:50:00,1961,"Thems some kickass Garlic.We are already eating tomatoes here,cucumbers are rolling also.I'll try to post some pics this weekend.I love a good garden thread. Joe"
483994,kickingfrog,2010-07-10 02:18:00,8333,Nice!  This is the first year for us planting a vegetable garden. I'll try to get out and take some photos as well.
483996,Leecher,2010-07-10 02:55:00,7832," Thanks Mike!!!  A little trick for the peppers is to mix sheep manure and bone meal into the earth before planting.  You can also add peat moss into the mix   Yes Bruce, every week I add a couple of inches of sheep manure to the base of the plants and give them a good soak to get the nutrients down to the roots.  It sure makes a big difference   Oh you haven't seen the rest of my lawn John     There in great numbers I'm afraid   Thanks Joe!!!  Please do.... I'd love to see them   Thanks Rob!!!  I remember my first garden.... wish I had pics to show you.  Please do take photos and post them"
483997,Fish Farmer,2010-07-10 02:55:00,2234,"Man"" that Garlic looks good, peppers to. Leechman I planted Ox-heart tomatoes this year also, couldn't find plants so I did the seed thing. My plants are about a foot now. you don't hear many people mention Ox-heart. Have you grown them before? Do they pollinate with the other types? Someone told me that you should only grown one type of tomato because they get mixed up and get funny shaped. I see you have wire around. You must get pestered with Rabbits. Nice looking garden"
483999,markiemark70,2010-07-10 03:04:00,158,"Nice looking garden you got there. We have alot of the same crops. I guess by the cages that you have a lot of critters where you live? My Beans have been ravaged by Rabbits then Mice, but everything else is good and I now have a fence up!  Thanks for the tour."
484001,Leecher,2010-07-10 03:10:00,7832," Thanks Fish Farmer!!!  First time trying the Oxheart.... was able to get a plant from one of our local garden store... funny thing is that my wife wanted a cherry tomato plant and could not find any... so instead bought that one     Wish I could answer your second question but I truly don't know.  The wire around is to keep the cats, squirrels and ground hog out   Plus it provides support for the plants"
484004,Leecher,2010-07-10 03:19:00,7832," Thanks Mark!!!  yes critters as in cats, squirrels and believe it or not ground hog, the darn thing eats my apples too     That is why I decided to fence up.... problem solve"
484024,bigugli,2010-07-10 07:28:00,6138,"Oxheart is an old standard juice tomato. Long, cylindrical, a beefsteak that looks like a Roma. The drawback to the variety is that it is prone to blossom rot in wet years. Never water in the evening.  Cross pollination is not usually an issue. We have 12 varieties of tomato at the greenhouse staying true to form. To increase pollination yield we just rustle the plants a bit to shake the pollen loose. I'll put up pics later. Just getting ready for the market."
484032,Big Cliff,2010-07-10 09:54:00,6899,"That Garlic, well your whole garden is amazing! We use to have a nice garden but over the years we've down sized it because I was always so busy with work and Sue couldn't help with it. Now all I have is a small asparagus patch and a little herb garden.  Thanks for posting!"
484053,Fish Farmer,2010-07-10 11:39:00,2234," Thanks for the tips bigugli, you just saved the day   I sometimes water at night . Give the plants a shake, I'll be giving that a try, thanks again."
484095,canadadude,2010-07-10 14:46:00,769,"Be carefull growing garlic,you must continue to grow garlic now every year or bad luck will haunt you. At least thats was what I was told by many Eastern European friends who were scared to plant garlic.I guess in europe garlic is considered a magical plant and they believe once you grow it,you must continue the tradition throughout your life.This is why you plant it on the first full moon in November.  Anyway don't mean to scare you with some old european wives tales, your garlic looks nice,just beware and keep up the tradition now of growing some garlic every year.You will be rewarded with good luck and all the great powers that come along with garlic.You shouldn't have any problems with whearwolves or vampires either hahahaha"
484100,Leecher,2010-07-10 14:55:00,7832, Great tips Bruce    Thanks!!!   Thanks Cliff!!!  Yeah I too down sized it for the same reasons.... it's much easier to maintain now
484102,alexcba,2010-07-10 15:00:00,634, LOL! atleast once a day a post from you makes me nearly spit my coffee out over the screen.
484104,Leecher,2010-07-10 15:08:00,7832," LOL  Thanks canadadude!!!  Garlic is very easy to grow and is low maintenance.... plus it's good in spaghetti sauce and stir fries.  Main reason I grow it.  Been at it for 5 - 6 years now and with what you just said, I'll surely continue the tradition"
484212,Fishing 24/7,2010-07-11 00:52:00,709,too bad i dont eat veggies..... id be at your place in a SECOND!
484222,The Urban Fisherman,2010-07-11 01:16:00,2050,"THAT IS AWESOME!  Ginny's been on me to make her a garden all summer but time hasn't been on my side!    Good work with your garden man!  Keep in touch.  cheers, Ryan"
484328,bigugli,2010-07-11 15:37:00,6138,"As I got my self involved in specialty cropping at my good friend's greenhouse. Here's what we focus on. Tomatoes. 3 varieties of beefsteak. 4 varieties of cluster/vine.   10 varieties of miniatures.  For the ""Klompers"" out there  Snijbonin  My garlic was picked much earlier. Here are my salsa jalapenos.   Currants are done and the elderberry are a long way from ready. It sure keeps us busy."
484417,Leecher,2010-07-11 19:37:00,7832, Yeah too bad    I don't usually share.... but I'd make an exception... maybe   Thanks Ryan!!!  You should give it a try and get the kids involved.... I'm sure they'd love it   Wow Bruce   Very nice Thanks for posting Jacques
