484520,The Urban Fisherman,2010-07-12 01:40:00,2050,"  you can use all kinds of things... I usually just use a big tube jig,  Some guys use lizards or big worms..."
484521,PikeMolester,2010-07-12 01:41:00,428,"I've used 10 inch ribbontails,crazy legs chigger craws and multiple goby baits hoping to catch a monster on St-Francis. But nothing yet. I ought to try tubes and lizards"
484522,Drew_10,2010-07-12 01:41:00,111,"You can use pretty much any soft plastic.  Zoom lizards are popular, as are beaver baits.  Experiment and try to match the hatch as best as possible.  Using a straight shank worm hook as opposed to a wide gap hook will help make your rig more weedless."
484523,fish-miester,2010-07-12 01:42:00,864,if / when I use a carolina rig I use pretty much all the same baits I would as if I was fishing Texas rigged. depending on the weeds. less weeds.. the less weedless
484526,Rattletrap2,2010-07-12 01:50:00,1652,"Gord, I would use pretty much any soft plastic. Lizards are of course most popular. Tubes would be good as well.  Have you tried wacky rigging a ""Senko"" type worm on a circle hook?"
484533,lookinforwalleye,2010-07-12 02:11:00,4399,"  You know Brian I love fishing Senko`s but have never wackied,I am going to try it next weekend!!"
484577,OhioFisherman,2010-07-12 09:03:00,6623,"Like mentioned by others a lizard is usually the stand by bait on a Carolina rig. I have seen a variety of soft plastics used though, craws, tubes, and wide paddle tail worms. I usually went with a 6 inch zoom lizard."
484584,singingdog,2010-07-12 10:40:00,1047,"If you set up a texas rig with a eagle claw bobber stop in front of, and behind your worm sinker, you can easily convert it from a Trig to a Crig without retying. It's a great setup and one of the most versatile ways to fish soft plastics."
484642,OhioFisherman,2010-07-12 15:02:00,6623,The rubber slide in worm weight stops work pretty well also.
484772,lunkerbasshunter,2010-07-12 21:37:00,2585,wacky rigging a senko bait is one of the best ways to catch them. I highly reccomend it.  you can also get walleye on weedlines using this technique.  cheers!
