Through it all the fish have kept biting, although some days you had to work a lot harder than others.  It all started in the rain.   Then it got quite cool with high winds.     Please note the seven year old is successfully using a baitcaster!   Last week we had the heat-wave.     Then came a couple of days with sudden down pours with thunder and lightning   Tourist's question...So; what is the Ontario weather like in July? Resident's answer...We're not sure, but if you don't like it, just wait a few minutes...It will change!"
484111,JohnF,2010-07-10 15:46:00,3494,Can you schedule some nice weather so I can come for a visit? I really want to try dropshotting with that new spinning rod and my Calcutta needs setting up. I don't think my arms are as long as Albert's so I'll never match his catch but I'll settle for little 'uns like those other guys caught.  JF
