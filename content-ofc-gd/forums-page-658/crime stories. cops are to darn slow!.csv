Code...and this includes every offence under the criminal code. You are also allowed to use reasonable force to detain the person - and let's not turn this into a issue on what is considered reasonable......."

484575,ctranter,2010-07-12 08:24:00,543," First, let me say that I have absolute respect for all law enforcers.  Personally the OPP helped my family find a missing family member who had been missing in the forest.  They were 100% caring and compassionate, and incredibly sensitive - How else do you inform families of lost lives?  Then theres the flip side.  When I meet a Toronto Police Officer who actually treats me like a human being (having only encountered them in traffic stops), I'll let you know.  The last ticket I got was 15 over in a 50 zone (...understandable), but the officer threatened to book me on DUI charges, apparently he smelled weed.  Let's be clear - I have never smoked weed in my car, and any ""smell"" he thought he smelled was completely fabricated.  The cop pulled an obvious scare tactic, and was extremely condescending to me (I just wanted to get my ticket).  The cop continued to threaten my Gf in the passenger seat, claiming she was just as criminally responsible as I was, we would both lose our licences ect... (we laughed when he said this).  I see the same little rat in the same section of the Allen Expressway on many nice summer days (no precipitaiton means traffic cops actually work? hehe I kid) and everytime I drive by him I go -5 km/h of whatever the limit is and flip him a serious bird."

484595,DanD,2010-07-12 12:10:00,2223," Here's my story of trying to do the right thing and then getting paid back by the neighbor for me not minding my own business.  I'm sitting out on my front porch and I hear two of the neighbors (different households) across the street, start yelling at each other; don't know what the fight was about didn't care. The woman hauls off and slaps the guy; he in-turn shoves her to the ground and was winding up to kick her while she was down. I yelled at him to stop which he did but the yelling was getting worse and it was just a matter of time before there would be more physical assaults. I told my wife to call the cops, which she did and it didn't take them long to get to the house; MY HOUSE!! These two cops are now on my porch confirming whether it was us that called and take a statement from us? Meanwhile the two neighbors are still going at it yelling and screaming at each other; finally the two cops go across and break up the argument. Now the male neighbor realizes that it was me that called the cops and starts threatening me ""I'll get you you...!""; right in front of the cops. Well a long story short the cops leave after about an hour and I'm getting all kinds of cat calls from the neighbor. The next morning I wake up to see 8 flat tires on our vehicles. Called the one cop that left his business card and all he does is give me an occurrence number for the insurance company. He says if it happens again just call it in and try and stay away from the guy; I live across the street? I know what was the cop suppose to do after the fact; but why would those two idiot cops come to my house first; when it was obvious why they were called; the neighbors were nose to nose screaming at each other? It really makes you want to get involved and do the right thing doesn't it?  Dan."
484713,pike n' whities,2010-07-12 18:36:00,131,"Yea DanD it does. specially when you hear (and cant help but laugh) at comments like ""i'll burn your fingers"" and that comment came from a completely sober man!  thank you for the explanation FishnNAutographs, and I am well aware of what excessive force is."
484860,Dozer,2010-07-13 02:26:00,896,"When I needed the cops, they showed up to late, I'm not blaming anyone for it, but I've lost faith.  When I needed help with a violent drunk family member, my neighbours showed up to help, I talked with our lawyer friend and he told me everything I needed to tell the police they needed to hear to take the drunk away, after hearing the stories they still didn't take them away.  After I told our lawyer friend what happened, he called them lazy.  Last week at a party I had some idiot cop tell me he's going to ""arrest me for being drunk"", while I JUST showed up and cracked my first beer  I understand the job is hard, but get a damned system in place."

I'm not saying the police are always right but watching the G20 nonsense in Toronto I saw a lot of folks wasting the cops' time with their righteous indignation when in fact they should have stepped back and let the police deal with the real troublemakers, or better yet, not been there at all.

484158,aplumma,2010-07-10 20:48:00,6896,Why is it 10% of the areas patrolled take up 50% of the forces time?If the neighborhood you live in is crappy then work harder and move to a better area.I hate the way people blame the 911 responders because they are not their instantly. You try getting to a place in less than 5 min when you are babysitting people that if they used a little common sense they would not need to overwhelm the 911 system.

There isn't one profession that every move you make, everything you write down and everything you say is scrutinized.  In reality, 99% of the public have no idea what it's like to be an officer and to be honest I had no idea what I was getting into when I got hired. No one realizes that the idiot a copper arrests for impaired driving will have to do about 6 hours of paperwork afterward....  Again, the bottom line is....when the majority of the armchair quarterbacks leave for work in the morning, they're most likely going to see their family when their shift/work day is done. I have to kiss my wife and children good bye everymorning knowing there's a chance that that will be the last time I ever see them.

Several of my friends who are firefighters tell me a busy 24 hour shift for them is 5 call outs..... The rest of the time they don't really do anything other than work out and some training... A slow day for me is 5-10 call outs...so don't tell me that you know the system. Saying police don't show up is a pile of Bunk... Arm chair quarterbacks need to stop getting information from television....we're human and we have limits...thinking that finding the person who egged your house or broke your window is more important than the dirt bag who's robbing people at gun point, beating the crap out of their wives and the drug dealer selling to your kids. If you knew how hard it was to put on a uniform and have men women and children hate you because of the uniform and dealing with people you would run screaming from you'd change your tone.

484275,mbac31,2010-07-11 11:28:00,904,"I for one grew up in a Law Enforcement family so I will leave my personal comments to myself. But I will leave you with a couple of things I noticed growing up. For one most cops will do there job and well , its hard to come and arrest a punk when he/she has more rights then the Cops or people that he/she just commited the crime against. He will be out on the street in a few hours  providing he gets arrested at all. This is all thanks to our  ""Young Offenders Act""  Thank you for such a farce Canada. LMAO.  Also there are 2 sides to every story, Like any profession Policing is no different. You will have some there for reasons none other than they were picked on in school and they have something to prove. You know them. We all call them the   You have thm in any profession. Its easy to find fault in any job or easy to tell one side of the story and not the other. You still have the right in Canada to protect your Family and Property if you feel threatened but not with excessive use of force. But let me tell you. I have had this experience and will not elaborate to much but I for one protected my wife and home once and never took any heat for it at all. Got arrested and all came out in the wash but had to when police showed up because they need to determine who is who.  I will continue to do so anywhere I live or travel. Thats just an instinct of us being human. Wether or not you have the common sense to adjust yourself to use proper restraint is up to ones self.  Another thing is that people are to dam nosey. Sorry for that but if it does not apply to you mind your business. If you see something going wrong. Call the proper people. Most times thats the best. Just call 2 or 3 detachments. That always works. Someone will come and usually in a timely fashion unless you in the Artic where the Police only bring themselves to trek up there on Christmas. lol. Been there, I know.  Also and most important. Here is what I have observed growing up. The lack of respect. A Police officer gets none usually. I'm not sure why. They are no different then any other person. I'm a Construction worker and if I was looked upon by the public as police officers are I would be a little bias at times. Sorry but its true. They are not stupid and can usually tell when you are hiding something. We all can. Gut feelings are the same in any job or profession. Most peoples reaction to a police officer is to get their backs up. No need. Granted there are cops that are    as is the same with lots of people. Ive seen them get nasty looks just for going through a drive through or even going inside to grab coffee. For what I dont know. The atmosphere always changes no matter what. Rmember the difference is only a job aspect. No different then any of us. Keep that in mind when you are rude or quick to judge one when he has to come into your home or area because some person who has been arrested numerous times or is known to police or is just coming out the end of a 12-14 hour shift or answering the 30th call that night all with having to deal with attitude by just showing up when it was you that called. It is a tough job."
484289,Terry,2010-07-11 12:10:00,14456," There are 2 sides to every story  and there are good cops and bad cops  if you have ever had a cop lie to make you look guilty if you have not done something wrong but a cop strong arms you  if you have had a cop treat you like a criminal, because you are in a police station, and harass you, then the cop you where talking to comes back and tells the other cop that you are reporting a crime and not a suspect and rather then apologize, he says he has his eye on you...just maybe you lose all respect for them and when one walks/drives up to you you are afraid that your civil rights are about to be stomped on....   why do people not respect cops  because cops are humans and as such they are just as prone to human emotions, thoughts and mistakes as the rest of us....we are at their mercy to their ever whim...they care weapons and if we felt threatened by them we can not do anything about it as we would be killed or anything else they want and we would be guilty until proven innocent..your word against them..good luck    having said that I would not want their job I could not hold my emotions in check as well as most of them do  they do have a tough job"
484297,Handlebarz,2010-07-11 13:27:00,3790,I must say that the cops are good around my area heck just last month they were here in 30 seconds to catch the 3 pukes that were breaking into the CRACK HEADS house next to us (that is another story)the wife called the cops when she saw a guy leaving the house with a TV before the other 2 could get out with the junk they took the first guy dropped the TV on the road as there was 2 cruisers already pulling up. They got all 3 and it was funny to here the one PUKE crying saying he did nothing wrong BOO HOO crying that he did nothing wrong with a hand full of her JUNK.  No on the other hand I was pissed at them on Canada day as my wife was towed along with 4 others who were parking in a no parking area. For the 5 who were downtown on Canada day from just before noon on Canada day they had no clue that after they parked some officer was coming around with NO PARKING signs to put up for the parade. My wife and son were enjoying the day with the rides and all the shows on the main stage downtown just 1 block away from where she parked when she got a call from her friend who saw a wrecker tow her van. She called me (I was still 2 hours away from home) so not much help I told her to go to the cop shop and see what went on that is where she found out there was 5 of them towed at $85 each. I think that is a crock as there was no signs up early and the street was packed at noon one would think signs would be posted the night before or at least before the party in the park started that day heck they could have even made a announcement in the park that people need to move but Oh no just tow and leave the people to find out for themselves.  I guess that's carma for getting them PUNKS caught

I guess he was on magic mushrooms. He was looking for trouble of course with racist comments. (I have black relatives) he was told to leave the property and refused. he threatened to smash the van and what not. So of course me being on the young side myself got caught up in the action and took a run at him. he turned around and ran down the street. It was actually quite funny to hear him speak and his insults afterwords. but anyhow he took off to another house down the street and started trouble down there. no physical altercations tonight but it was damn close with a few people. he kicked their house and hit their van and eventually removed his jogging pants. the cops eventually came after 30 mins on the dot. called them 3 times!!! gave them crap for their slow response too. they ended up chassing this guy down the creek and caught him with out further issues.

My wife and my oldest child went out for our last supper together as a threesome.  It was sunny Sunday afternoon and we were only gone from 4-5pm.  When I was opening the front door of the house I saw two punks running out the back door !  I immediately blocked my wife and daughter and told them to get back in the car. Then ran in to the house and grabbed the phone and dialed 911.  As I did this, my wife and daughter came in to the house to see what had happened and i told them that I think we were robbed by the punks that i saw. Then I saw one of them hi tail it down our driveway between the house and i went after him. I dialed 911 again, but this time on my cell phone and told them i was gonna run the bugger over if i caught him. By the time I got to the end of the street the punk was gone.  As i was turning around I could hear sirens coming our way. Police and ambulance were dispatched !  I must have told them my wife was HAVING the baby   too !  It turns out that because I had visual on them, they prioritized our call and also sent the k9 unit  The k9 officer immediately told me that we had been hit by pros ???? huh   ( wires were cut from TV's and stereo and computers etc and all the windows were open on March 8)  Needless to say, we were very shaken by all this and thoroughly distraught by such a horrible violation just before the biggest day  of my life ( birth of my only natural child).  It was a horrible night for us. We all slept in the same bed and just cried our older daughter to sleep.  (They stole her video collection as well and all my wifes jewelery but somehow missed a bag of the weekend deposits from our store right on the coffee table)  At 6:00 am the next morning my father arrived to watch the house for us. And a few minutes later, two service men showed up to secure the house.   They showed us a police report and were wearing name tags. We called the insurance company to confirm that they were supposed to be there !  When we got to the hospital, there were flowers waiting for us from the insurance company  The nurses already knew what we went through the night before as well.  It turns out that the K9 officer took it upon himself to call our insurance company that night after he finished his shift. ( i was wondering how they knew already since i hadn;t called them yet)  There was also more flowers delivered while our baby was being delivered. That same officer again !  I cannot say enough this am about that experience with the London Police services and that particular officer. ( i never did remember to get his  name and have long lost the report to find it.)  It was because of his thoughtfulness that alot of the tension was lifted that morning.  And it was from my wife's true sense of what i RIGHT in our world when she rolled over to me and quietly said as the doctor tolf us what our child was:  "" Honey, everything we lost last night, God just gave us back this morning"".   Thank you God for my wife and that officer as I am not sitting in a jail cell today doing time over killing a PUNK ass robber."

484050,Danubian,2010-07-10 11:33:00,65,"I live in a townhouse complex and last summer I had some younger neighbors which one late night started a fight on their front lawn. (There were 2 or 3 couples living together in that unit -probably rented- and one couple I guess was moving out, because they were throwing stuff out when the fight began.) He was wearing only a pair of shorts and was yelling, swearing at her, then punched her in the face a couple of times, then he started dragging her by her hair, finishing the round by kicking her in the ass or stomach. She was crying and asking for help. I called 911 and tried to explain the situation, but apparently the operator was more interested to establish my identity/location, although I told them that I need no help myself. Anyhow... As we were speaking, the guy started round 2 of beating up his wife/gf and the operator clearly heard the young woman crying for help. Now the operator asked about these guys address and I couldn't tell which unit number was, being in the opposite corner, but I mentioned that there is a lot of junk on their lawn an a moving van parked on the driveway. The operator said they will dispatch a unit and when I found that I was the only person calling in about the incident, I mentioned that I don't want the cops knocking at my door. I gave them my phone number and I said ""call me and we can discreetly meet in my backyard, if you need a witness for your report"". Call me a woos, but I had obvious reasons to do so... 20 minutes later -when everything was calm- a cops cruiser arrived, they drove by, couldn't figure the suspect's unit -obviously the junk and the van were still there- and they came straight up knocking to my door. I had to answer and indicated them where the incident took place, but they didn't bother to go and check. They said something like ""call us again when they start fighting"". Now I was wondering what's in the store for me in case the wifebeater figured I called the cops on them, but luckily they packed and moved the next day.  I think that this was an exception having to deal with the only pair of the laziest cops I ever seen, but I am still shocked what a bunch of chickenass neighbors I have. How is it possible to hear and see all that ""horror show"" and still do nothing???"

Things have change in the last few years but when there's an allegation of a criminal offence in a domestic involving an intimate couple the crim code says we have to arrest..."
484055,fishing n autograph,2010-07-10 11:42:00,2540,You'll be surprised how fast neighbours forget things or suddenly lose their vision and hearing
484061,Daplumma,2010-07-10 12:00:00,1961,I'm with Roy.Two altercations in a short time is one too many.Thats two more than I have had in the last 30 years.
484063,smally21,2010-07-10 12:08:00,993,cant even get started on this issue but in my highly populated fully serviced area (in a high income area as well) the police are a minumum 45 minutes or just never come at all. i dont want to lie to the dispatcher but you almost need to in order to get tiered within the week. its never the officers fault of course but there is definitely a problem with the system when punk kids vandalize a neighbourhood for an hour and no police ever show up......
484067,fishing n autograph,2010-07-10 12:19:00,2540,Well in terms of dispatching...property damage like vandalizm is a priorty 4...not an emergency and in the grand scheme of things violent domestics etc take precedent
484070,Big Cliff,2010-07-10 13:02:00,6899,"When my brother-in-law and best friend passed away 2 years ago, I was the one that found him. I didn't know what to do, I have had extensive training in first aid, CPR, and we have a defibrulator here at home because of Sue, a couple of quick checks and I knew he was gone but I had never been in this situation before so I called 911.  The dispatcher had police, fire rescue, and ambulance there within minutes. The one officer that was first to respond was Cliff Tate, I'll never forget him! He was wonderful! He helped me way above and beyond what he had to! Made sure I was OK, helped me to arrange to have someone come to take care of Sue, told me what I should do about securing Herb's stuff. He stayed with me until every thing was taken care of and he and I were the last two people out of the door. He shook my hand and told me that if I needed ANYTHING, to call him!  The Cliff Tates that serve and protect us deserve a lot of respect which they seldome seem to get! people are always so ready to find fault. I'd stand shoulder to shoulder with any one of them any day of the week at any time!"
484072,lunkerbasshunter,2010-07-10 13:16:00,2585,"imagine how bad it would be with out them??????  Imagine the G20 black hooded chickens if the force wasnt out in full force?  Now imagine areas like scarboarough, Detroit, St louis, miami etc..... if they where not patroling our streets?  Also imagine how many cases like bernardo would still be on the street without them.  For your case, yeah it sucks but for everyone of the cases you posted there are 30 cases we never hear about that the cops do deal with.  Lets cut our boys and girls in blue some slack and appriciate the fact that they put there own lives at risk everyday they step out there front door to go to work!  Cheers!"
484075,Rattletrap2,2010-07-10 13:27:00,1652," Cliff, There are people in all professions that are in it for the right reason. Sounds like you found one of them in Officer Cliff Tate!"
484077,Grimace,2010-07-10 13:49:00,2020,"Police officers are just like any other people.  A few losers, a few very special people and a lot in between.  I have come into contact with some robots and it makes you shake your head.   I have also seen some really excellent cops do some extraordinary things.  The police officers that have irked me are the ones that have a general distaste for the population, there are a bunch of them around.  Then you have to think of the guys who get crazy old men taking pot shots at them and they do not have the opportunity to go home and see their young children and wife ever again.  Or the guys that are running into a situation when everyone else is running from it.  Some of them act poorly (like the two mid 20's cops I saw laughing and racing there cars at 170 on the 407 last year, 1 was an OPP 1 was a Yorky.)  Some of them act incredible.  I just hope that none of them have to act incredible around me.  If that ever happens I doubt I will ever complain about the other ones again."
484096,bigfish1965,2010-07-10 14:48:00,3382,"The accident i saw the other night had four cruisers, four firetrucks and two ambulances arrive within minutes. I think things like imminent danger should take priority and I have no issue with that. Nothing but praise for the police here. Well except for that one who gave me a ticket when I was 18 for 'excessive noise' violation for spinning my tires"
484098,bassman87,2010-07-10 14:50:00,586,yeah cops in the 1920s were harsh
