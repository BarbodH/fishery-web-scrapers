Well it was probably more like my mom and dad watched it 100 times , but i always found myself sitting in with them to watch.  I think that comedy special sprung the Cosby Show not long after (may be wrong)  Good clean stand up..........not that i dont enjoy a dirty comic lol.......but not much out there these days that id feel comfortable sitting down with my niece and nephew watching."
