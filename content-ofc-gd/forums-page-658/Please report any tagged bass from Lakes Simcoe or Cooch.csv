The Aurora Bassmasters are now in their 5th year of this tagging project - supported thru MNR's Community Fisheries Wildlife Involvement Program. Over 1,000 bass have been sampled at bass tournaments around the lakes. They are double tagged (right behind the dorsal fin) a scale and spine are taken for ageing and then they're released. Look carefully for the tags - they could be covered in algae - which is normal ... but scrape it away and the tag numbers and MNR's phone number will magically appear. Please record numbers on paper in boat, as well as size of fish, date caught general location (no GPS spots required) and overall condition of fish. Then don't forget to call in with that important information. Please release any tagged bass so they can continue to contribute to this important research project. Some tagged bass have already been caught a few times!  Thanks for your help,  Wil Wegman"
