I didn't even know the walleye got his big on this lake! I hope everyone has been safe through these past months!!      "

1075185,DanD,2021-07-30 14:50:00,2223,I've have a trailer down at Normandale (Close to Turkey Point) now for about 25 years. Still enjoy going down there on the weekends; even if all I do is sit on the deck and watch the park world go by. It's nice to see you posting again Cliff. Dan
