Wore them all week up in temagami bush whacking portage trails with chain saws and they held up quite well, lightweight and quick dry"

They also have contract manufacturing of a lot of items that they under their own brands (Caperlan for example), under their own specs which are quite good, and they sell these items at very competitive prices (see the fishing lures for example). Fishing and hunting are not their primary departments. They are more famous for Cycling, Hiking, Gym and other sports gear."
