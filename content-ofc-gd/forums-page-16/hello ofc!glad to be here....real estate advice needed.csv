1045840,captpierre,2019-06-14 15:41:00,2521,Lots to consider. Unless youâ€™re a hermit and love bugs you need to think this thing through. There was a great thread this winter about this. Iâ€™ll try to find it.
1045841,offgriddin,2019-06-14 16:16:00,39,"i understand the concerns,i have spent half my life in the bush.i have been on numerous hunting trips,our family has a remote hunt camp,fishing trips,including very remote fly ins....i have been dreaming of this for 30 years!!!!!  im not selling my home till the fall so i have 4 months to figure everything out...hence starting this thread"
1045842,offgriddin,2019-06-14 16:17:00,39,and i am kind of a hermit...i very much enjoyÂ the solitude of nature

1045893,grt1,2019-06-16 15:17:00,638,"if you are bound to do this, why not look around the area you want to be in, then go to the mnr and ask if you can get a land use permit for that site,"
1045905,pics,2019-06-16 21:16:00,1268,Tough to find any place like that on a real estate site.Â  Most properties where I moose hunt have a handmade signs when they sell their property. You may need to drive up there and check small local stores to find anything.Â  I was considering buying a camp in Nova Scotia and word of mouth seems to be aÂ  good way to find a hiddenÂ  gem rather than the real estate people.
1045909,Jmeyer,2019-06-17 02:32:00,83,"Unorganized townships are indeed cheap on taxes which I believe are paid direct to the province simular to leases to the mnr, however neighbouring municipalities which service unorganized residents for emergency services in some cases charge you directly for police and ambulance. Price wise the blind river area is far cheaper then north of the Sault, good places to look are kijiji, dignam land and recreationland.net"

1045951,Old Ironmaker,2019-06-18 02:06:00,8243,"There are more than a few television series that feature individuals and families that are doing what you wish to do in the near future. In Alaska, The Yukon as well in the lower 48. Bing watch them and decide if you can really do what they are. A few months hunting in the bush alone won't prepare you for 12 months of talking to yourself, then eventually answering yourself. In my opinion from watching these shows it's a lot like crime. You can't learn it in a classroom or start it late in life. If you are retiring I take it you aren't a spring chicken. I see fitness is a huge part of being off grid. For those that are middle age they have a support family of more then a few kids. It appears 60 years old seems to be the age that one living off grid has to tap out if they are indeed solo. If I was 40 years younger I was nuts enough to try it, but, I would have someone to keep me warm other than my Dog. If someone tells you that you are nuts take it as a compliment. Good luck and don't let anyone tell you that you can not do it. And if you try and find you are unable to do it you did not fail, it simply is a life lesson that prepares you for the next adventure in your life."
1045965,Jmeyer,2019-06-18 10:48:00,83,"I would tread careful with this deal, I tried to read between the lines on the website and seen some red flags. Licensed lots? Annual fees for services? Sounds like a trailer park and if it is do they have approvals? I know it's unorganized townships they target but 75 unserviced lots on a water front would have a environmental impact. If it's a license vs deed or lease how's your investment protected? Sounds like they are more interested in the land investment part then actually giving back to the investors"
