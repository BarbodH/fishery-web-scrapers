1075743,aplumma,2021-08-28 22:09:00,6896,There is no such thing as a tiller fan...... let the games begin CONSOLE  Art
1075744,Spiel,2021-08-28 22:27:00,9065,Bite your tongue southern man.    	Brook loved the openness of the bad ass tiller. 
1075777,cisco,2021-08-29 22:37:00,597,Nice rig. Not the best for when them flying carp are doing their thing. Man overboard!!!
1075778,AKRISONER,2021-08-30 00:25:00,5558,Aaron weibe has been running a 250 for a few years on a warrior. Not my cup of tea but if I was fishing anything but a bass boat I’d be in a tiller
1075806,akaShag,2021-09-01 15:18:00,2073,Interesting.  Reckon you need a big-ass boat just to keep your stern from going under with the weight of that!
