I installed it for him and he loves the anchor,cruise control,autopilot ect. He doesnt like the remote hanging on his neck  like most guys  commented on a previous post!  So, i put my McGyver mind to work and came up with a pedal dock for the remote!  Works like a charm! You can feel the buttons click even with shoes on.very little presure neede to operate it! And you still have all the other i pilot features available!   Cheers!    "

1075542,AKRISONER,2021-08-17 19:20:00,5558,lol this is actually pretty smart. I could see someone mass produce these on some scale for guys with the powerdrives i pilots
1075548,Gil Levesque,2021-08-17 21:27:00,103,Yeah! Thought about that. Should i patent it or would MinnKotta steal the idea! Is therevenough of a market! I could refine it and make them on a limited basis!

1075569,Sinker,2021-08-18 16:24:00,8692,"That is super slick. I'd buy one. You should really look into making these, there are a lot of unhappy people with powerdrive Ipilot units. S."
1075577,Gil Levesque,2021-08-18 19:13:00,103,"What price would people pay for it! Ask too much, no one buys ,ask too little,you take a beating! I have no plans to market this! Maybe if i was younger! Lol!"
