Got a hit and netted the fish and the hooks came out.  Very light bites.  Great trip but came home early because of the poor fishing.  I’m ready to go again. "
1075737,LostAnotherOne,2021-08-28 16:42:00,956,Good job.  Every time I go there’s always white caps and I can’t even get out of the river.
1075745,Rizzo,2021-08-29 00:16:00,4754,"St C can be great...but it can be tough too. When the conditions are on, you can expect a great day. But you can also have pure mud water, 3 foot whitecaps, floating weeds you can practically walk across, etc. I would say I have a love/hate relationship with St Clair! Glad you got into one at least."
1075746,glen,2021-08-29 00:27:00,2641,My friends biggest fish ever and first Muskie.  Great guy to fish with.  We did 100miles in the boat. It took $40 in gas.  Great trip.
1075750,Rizzo,2021-08-29 02:10:00,4754,"well the old line is ""fish of 10,000 casts"" now they can add ""or 100 miles of trolling"""
1075751,Rizzo,2021-08-29 02:11:00,4754,anytime someone gets a pb...I don't care what you had to endure....call it a success
1075787,Snidley,2021-08-30 21:04:00,620,I saw the charter guy that Bob Izumi and Charlie Ray go out with all the time say that for his St Clair Charters the best conditions come on an Eastern wind. When asked about it he said the caveat that East is Least for fishing does not apply to St Clair.  It was a calm water point that he was making.
