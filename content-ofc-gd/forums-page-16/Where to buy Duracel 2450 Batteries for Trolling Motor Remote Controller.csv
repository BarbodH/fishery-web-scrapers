1073789,fundseeker,2021-06-03 15:10:00,27,Just wondering if anyone has found an inexpensive online source or store front for Minkota  hand held remote controller batteries . I prefer the Duracel 2450 over the energizer because they last much longer.
1073790,dave524,2021-06-03 15:16:00,4508,"I get Sunbeam CR2025 batteries at Dollarama , a direct replacement, for a training collar for the dogs, they are like 4 for $3 . They last pretty good and about a 1/10 the price of Duracells"
1073795,porkpie,2021-06-03 19:45:00,2521,Amazon has them for $9.  I just buy the energizer at Canadian tire.  I don’t think I’ve ever seen the Duracell’s in a store. I haven’t had problems with the energizer but I always carry a spare.  Dollarama doesn’t carry 2450’s.
1073796,Fisherman,2021-06-03 20:16:00,7201,Princess Auto carries them in packs of 9 for a ridiculous cheap price of $4.99.
1073799,Raycaster,2021-06-03 22:44:00,528,"Im with Dave on saving money but last year my remote was acting up (turning off quickly, not connecting etc.).  Some sites were saying that the different brands have slightly different dimensions causing some remotes not to work properly. "
1073800,Dara,2021-06-03 22:54:00,3052,"Mine shuts off too. Very frustrating, generally when I run the motor over number 8 speed. Hijack alert I only changed battery once and got the new one at tool town...no name"
1073805,porkpie,2021-06-04 10:53:00,2521,CR2450??   That’s a smoking good deal I’ll have to go and get some tks!
1073806,porkpie,2021-06-04 10:56:00,2521,"My remote started to give me troubles last night.  I’ll try a different brand of battery, thanks!"
1073808,Sinker,2021-06-04 13:21:00,8692,There are some things you just don't cheap out on. My TM remote is one of them.  My batteries seem to last me a very long time too.  S.
1073809,Raycaster,2021-06-04 13:23:00,528,"I took my remote apart originally to look for damage and it appeared flawless. No water, no corrosion, no burnt parts...perfect. Instead of replacing I finally hit a site that mentioned the dimensions are slightly different and the contact areas don’t 100% match. The positive pad varies in size etc. I took out the digital calibers and found this to be true but never seemed enough to cause contact problems but switching different brands with slightly different forms did fix my problems. I found it was hit or miss and $$$ wasn’t a factor. It could be cheap sunbeams or expensive energizer, the exact form design was the ticket. Find 2 that work and put the spare in the tackle box! "
1073810,misfish,2021-06-04 13:24:00,29133,It all comes down to a good day or bad day of fishing. I agree with my bye here.
1073889,fundseeker,2021-06-09 16:52:00,27,Mountain  Equipment stores have Duracell CR 2450's for $5.96 each. I'm picking 4 up curbside on Thursday when I'm in Barrie for an appointment. I hope they don't try to swap out with Energizers . The duracells definitely last longer in my remote.
1073899,Sinker,2021-06-09 20:21:00,8692,I bought my ipilot last summer and am still using the same battery in my remote. Am i doing something wrong? S.
1073904,Dara,2021-06-09 20:56:00,3052,I used mine for 3 years...you just aren't fishing enough..same as me 
1073908,Old Ironmaker,2021-06-10 01:07:00,8243,We are talking about the batteries that cost a few bucks on the remote to run the elec. troller that with options and taxes might be close to $3000.00 are we not? Count enough pennies and one can spend more than 2 grand on an accessory I guess.
1073919,fundseeker,2021-06-10 12:18:00,27,I've been burning through a $10 3 volt Energizer battery every 2 days of fishing or so with 6 hours on the motor per trip on avg. 3-4 days per week.   . I use the pedal and the remote not just remote. The Duracells last for weeks but they are hard to find at store front retailers with none in Parry Sound. . As someone said it could be the tolerances of the battery to the remote causing the excessive usage on Energizer brand .  On a retirement income $7 every 2 weeks is preferable to $10 every 2 days.
1073942,porkpie,2021-06-10 23:11:00,2521,Something is not right there.  My battery generally lasts at least half a season and I use the motor a lot.  Matter of fact looks like my remote is pooched!  Glad I bought that spare terrova  ipilot kit when Canadian tire was blowing them out for $150.
1073980,Sinker,2021-06-12 15:26:00,8692,I'm on the water 2 or 3 days a week. Almost constant use of the bowmount the whole time on the water.  S.
1075834,Raycaster,2021-09-04 14:26:00,528,Sorry to refresh the thread again but remote again was inop on latest Lake Ontario launch. So when home I checked everything and replaced battery and went ahead and ordered a 5 pak from Amazon. My “1st world problem” is driving me crazy so I watched 5 youtube solutions. I have cleaned the contacts and bent them a little for better contact but the remote appears like brand new. One user said to insert battery upside down for 20 seconds. They actually said it was a solution from minn kota. It seems totally unlogical but IT WORKED. Still don’t believe it did anything but… it is now working.
