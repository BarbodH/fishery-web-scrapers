1075754,OhioFisherman,2021-08-29 05:00:00,6623,"As far as I know you have a choice of lead, brass, tungsten, but finding them in your area may be an issue? Lead, being the softest gives you the least feel, and the the price goes up with the others? https://www.aliexpress.com/item/1005001419435315.html?spm=a2g0o.search0304.0.0.1e0f729b8XP7B4&algo_pvid=a8b1a1c6-79a0-47de-bbb2-d2e5fca40040&algo_exp_id=a8b1a1c6-79a0-47de-bbb2-d2e5fca40040-21"

1075758,woodenboater,2021-08-29 12:17:00,2277,"these, and others are in stock at Cabelas Barrie. https://www.cabelas.ca/product/57700/eco-pro-tungsten-pro-drop-shot-weights"
1075761,AKRISONER,2021-08-29 13:57:00,5558,You can find tungsten drop spot weights almost anywhere now. Id suggest ordering online from Peterborough pro tackle better quality from a small business rather than garbage from big box. The last time I bought bass pro brand tungsten the swivels fell out instantly out of the package. Just garbage.
1075804,steellee,2021-09-01 14:59:00,21,"Although pricey, tungsten shouldnt be too hard to find. I use them in small creeks to toss tiny kwikfish and hotshots on 3 ways. A 5 pack I think is about 10+$ and usually lasts me a season. Worth every penny. Better feel of whats going on so I actually lose less plugs and better casting with less splash on entry to scare skittish trout"
