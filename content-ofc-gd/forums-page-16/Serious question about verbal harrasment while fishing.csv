There is enough stress in the world these days to be stressed while doing something to de-stress lol."

1075770,Snidley,2021-08-29 20:27:00,620,"I notice that the original poster is from Oakville so I assume he is fishing at Bronte for bass. I used to live in Oakville and I fished , for bass from a pontoon rowboat, at Oakville Creek. I understand pier fishing is no longer allowed at Oakville Creek so I guess Bronte is the only option for pier anglers. There have NEVER been very many bass at Bronte. Tons of Salmon and Rainbows in the spring and fall but very few bass particularly as compared to Oakville Creek (some know it a 16 Mile Creek). In the old days at Oakville Creek I would regularly get from  a low of 10 to 15 bass to a high of 50 or 60 bass a day. My best days at Bronte for bass would be maybe 6 to10 fish with zip a distinct possibility. I must also state that because I fish from a Hobie I had the option to go up the creek to Rebecca street so I had much more water to cover. I  have not been limited to fishing piers for some time but if I was forced by circumstance to fish from piers and I lived in Oakville and the option was Bronte (and from the western pier only as I believe you can't fish from the eastern pier anymore) I would be furious with an angler for keeping a bass that I understand is in very short supply. I would never say anything but I would be fuming.  I would be mad because  following the law in this case would be abusing the opportunities of others and would illustrate the kind of ignorance that typifies angling in Ontario. This deliberate ignorance manifests itself in littering, egg collection, derbies, reckless boating, impatience and unpreparedness at the boat launch and internet bro's inferring they would be beating people up over fishing etiquette. I must also point out that just because the MNR allows the retention of bass does not mean it is a good idea in all cases. Falling back on the legality of it only facilitates a careless approach to HELPING to manage fish so there's a sport of fishing available to all  and not a free feed for people that are not in dire financial circumstances."
1075771,akaShag,2021-08-29 20:47:00,2073,"Hmmmm.......................a bit touchy today are we Snidley?  Or just looking to get a thread locked with a bunch of sanctimonius, holier-than-thou claptrap?  So from some historical (and perhaps hysterical) perspective, there were not a lot of bass in one of your fishing spots, but in the same general area you could catch 50 or 60 bass in a day.  Bass are not endangered in Ontario, and if a good habitat supports more fish than a poorer one, that happens to be basic ecology.  Probably why there are or were more bass in one spot than another, within the same general area and body of water.  Keeping a bass, or for that matter a limit of bass, once in a while does ZERO to a fish population, almost anywhere in this province.  And if the OP, or anybody else who wants to keep fish to EAT, chooses to do so, that just happens to be their right.  Even if it makes you FUME. Rant off.  Just sayin'......................"
1075772,Rizzo,2021-08-29 20:56:00,4754,going from someone legally keeping a fish (from a lake with millions of bass) to this statement is pure nonsense. And I am a catch and release guy who would prefer everyone else do the same!
1075773,Snidley,2021-08-29 20:57:00,620,Like I said in the post I would not say anything to this angler. I would fume and the obvious fact that there's some fish in one spot and few in another motivates me and others to protect the spot that has few by not keeping fish even though the law allows it. It's sensible behavior that includes sportsmanship and thinking about the opportunities for others rather than taking what would never be necessary for sustinance.
1075775,huzzsaba,2021-08-29 21:06:00,884,"Thanks for your post, and I respect your opinion.  I am totally for conservation, which is why I always buy a conservation license.  I also guide people in my community about fishing ethics and rules etc and conservation.  Like I said, in all of 2021, I kept 2 bass from that spot.  I'd just like to fellow fisherman to not jump the gun and assume that someone keeping is filling buckets, and by that I mean the guy on the pier 😄.  I know some do that, and as long as its legal, I have no issue with it. Like I said before, one should not have to be stressed out when trying to de-stress.  Unfortunately, the city of Oakville closed down one of the better fishing spots, and it leaves a tiny spot for those interested in fishing to fish at.  Believe me, I try different bodies of water all the time, from Erie to Niagara river, but its cost a lot to go to these places even if not on a regular basis."
1075776,Snidley,2021-08-29 22:23:00,620,"Not to belabor the issue but knowing that restricted access is now a thing in Oakville and  the one spot available to people who don't have access to a boat was always almost devoid of bass I'm sure you can see why someone might take it upon themselves to voice their displeasure, wrong as it is.. Knowing what I do about Bronte the guy you are complaining about is an older guy with a name that starts with C and ends with F. He's gone apoplectic on me several times as well but for other angling related reasons. When our fall back position is that it's legal i think there's been a million posts here and elsewhere opining on the absurdly ineffectual way the government at all levels and the MNR specifically goes about their business. In many cases that something is legal  may also indicate that it's likely to be wrong headed at the minimum. One last thing. The same people that make Ontario fisheries law, the MNR, are the same folks who brought you the gentrification of the shoreline especially at Oakville Creek pier and waterfront and soon at Bronte as well.( I live in St Catharines and they have done the same thing here). I was at both meetings they had on the subject and the claim at that time was that miles of rip rap and boulevard level path walks would enhance the Lake Ontario fishery immensely. They failed to mention the fact that these new Yorkville level enhancements would be sullied by some grubby old anglers so the city of Oakville took it upon itself to ban fishing from Oakville Creek pier and they also banned it at Bronte Pier(s) for a time. There were enough complaints that they did open up the western pier to shore angling provided the anglers fished only the lake side of the pier and not the harbour side. Caught many bass on the lake side of the pier? I would say NO.  It should be noted that the city's side of the argument for closing the fancy new pier facilities to fishing were litter, swearing, fish guts, and reckless casting off the pier when latte drinking dog walkers passed by. As I said I would not have said anything"

If the guy walked up to him and started talking crap sure, but it's not the interfering with fishing/hunting law. In a court, what the guy did would be covered under the charter of rights. The guy is allowed to stay where he is and talk all the crap he wants. There was no mention of the guy moving away from where he is so I don't know where the intimidation part is coming from. There was no ""hate"" or ""racism"". The guy expressed his opinion, which we are allowed to do. Not once did the guy interfere with anything. The law was quoted in the thread already.

It has to be ongoing and the person harrassing needs to seemingly go out of their way to do it but you know that right?  Now if you read any of what you posted you will see that by definition nothing happened. Just because someone calls someone else name, which is protected via the charter of rights and that person doesn't feel comfortable doesn't make it a violation of the law.

1075679,huzzsaba,2021-08-25 00:50:00,884,"Hope everyone is doing well on the board. My go to spot for fishing decent fish, is the only fishable spot on the west end of town  I've been skunked there for many years, but finally figured out how to get the bass to bite. This year, Ive caught two so far.  First time many years ago, I tried bass, and I know this is a touchy subject, but I personally prefer the taste of bass.  The rest of the family doesnt eat fish and cant stand the smell of fish, but surprisingly they will eat bass and cant even tell I brought one home. Anyways, last two times I went to the pier, caught a nice 2-3 lb bass and kept 1 each time.  I know I'm within my rights to keep it, and to keep 2 out of such a large body of water in one season is not going to harm anything.  There are tons of bass there, just not easy to catch. So there is another fellow fisherman who regularly fishes there, and if he sees that I kept one, makes a big deal about it.  Last time I took a friend, and we had a double header.  He yells from halfway up the pier to ask if we kept both.  We said yes, and he starts swearing and saying you guys suck. Needless to say, a fun experience became a stressfull one, since we had to wait for him to leave before we could leave ourselves as we didnt want any kind of additional harrasment from him. I know simple answer is to ignore and fish on, but fishing should be a relaxing time, and not stressful.  God knows, with the price of everything going up, a little extra protein goes a long way, especially when legally caught. I guess the question is, can I report him, or better to leave it?"

Section 13 of the provincial Fish and Wildlife Conservation Act clearly states that it is illegal to obstruct or interfere with lawful fishing, hunting and trapping 13 (1) A person shall not interfere with lawful hunting, trapping or fishing by, (a) tampering with traps, nets, bait, firearms or any other thing used for hunting, trapping or fishing; (b) placing himself or herself in a position, for the purpose of interfering, that hinders or prevents hunting, trapping or fishing; or (c) engaging in an activity, for the purpose of interfering, that disturbs or is likely to disturb wildlife or fish.
