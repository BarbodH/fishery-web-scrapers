Had a momma bear & her cub come outta the ditch in front of us and while Mom ran across the road the youngun was smart enough to wait until we got past cause I sure wouldn't want to hit either one. Couple days later I was walking down the road near the cabin and another bear came outta nowhere about 75 feet in front of me and crossed over into the bush. I always carry my camera but never got a chance to take any pictures. Never saw a moose this time but there were several good fresh tracks one morning when I went for my daily hike. One set was very fresh tracks of 3 moose crossing the road together and I figured maybe Mom and a couple kids. There was also another good track just up the road from there. There was a Ministry water bomber working close to us but there was no obvious signs of fire so we figured maybe they were just practicing but interesting to watch just the same. I attached a couple pics.        "

1076012,mamona,2021-09-13 14:13:00,597,Awesome pics. I would wear GoPro if this area holds any wildlife.
1076014,woodenboater,2021-09-13 15:35:00,2277,"must have been incredible watching the water bomber making its low pass and water scoop. Only thing close to that was one time at Lakair, a helicopter kept circling low over the area. Asked about the equipment hanging below and Lesley and Kevin's son was a helo pilot and said it was likely something for monitoring leafy crops of, at the time, ill repute  fwiw, dropped by Lakair and it is so different now. cottages have been spruced up (a little too pretty for me tbh, I prefer lodge rustic). camping is def done but they have plans for more luxe camping. as during Lew's visit, place was very quiet   hope people return, dennis and denise have done alot to the place."
