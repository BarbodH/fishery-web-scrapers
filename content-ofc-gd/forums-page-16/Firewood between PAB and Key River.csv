Anyone know a spot where I can purchase bags or loose firewood between PAB and the Key thatâ€™s reasonably priced? Â Marina there is charging $12 a bag. Appreciate your replies."

1075518,Fisherman,2021-08-16 21:50:00,7201,"I have a vivid memory of that place, pulled up to an island and I was a little too ambitious trying to stop the boat, fell off the front and had one heel of a time trying to stand up with fleece pants and that heavy Norwegian sweater soaked head to toe.Â  Those were days."
1075520,akaShag,2021-08-16 23:42:00,2073,Yep.Â  And Marcel bought that steel boat from Dave and brought it home with him.Â  The same one that ran onto a shoal in the Ottawa River at twenty knots and stopped dead.Â  No damage to the hull but the two occupants got a bit knocked around...........ðŸ˜²
1075521,Fisherman,2021-08-16 23:45:00,7201,"Yup, I had to weld that trailer back together for him, axle was starting to part ways in a different direction, not good.Â  Life's moments."
