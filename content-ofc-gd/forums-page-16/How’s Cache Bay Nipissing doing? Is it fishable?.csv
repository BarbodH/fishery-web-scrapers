1075561,Raycaster,2021-08-18 03:16:00,528,Heading up to Lavigne 2nd week of September and its been over 10yrs since visiting. Cache Bay was SUPER thick but awesome and wondering how its changed over the years. We were barely able to get a boat in last time and had to deweed the prop every 5 minutes. We will be hitting the usual spots onÂ nipissing (and not destroy a prop again) but Cache Bay was were we learned how fish in weeds BIG TIME!
