1075625,Fisherman,2021-08-20 14:55:00,7201,"Took the chance with my cranky back and went along with my son out to GB for a morning of lure washing.  Meet at 0500 at the launch,  load my coffee, lunch, myself and a few pain killers and off we went.  No sooner out of the harbour and the waves were a tad on the large size but dammit we're going.  A slow ride out but set up by 0530, rig and set the rods.  At sunrise the first rod pops, nice 11 lb'er, into the box.  About 40 mins later, a 7 lb'er bit the cheater, you're coming for supper.  Around 8, a zinger, line burner,  ends up being a 15 lb'er, nice fight and into the box.  A few minutes later another on the cheater but managed to free itself.  That's all my back could handle, time to get back to hard ground.  Had a great day, I'm glad he convinced me to go.

1075628,Fisherman,2021-08-20 15:54:00,7201,"Hahahahaha, I don't think I could afford the gas and carbon tax to make that monster go, lol.  Martins 16 footer did the job."

1075653,captpierre,2021-08-22 11:51:00,2521,"Healthy looking fish. 10 yrs ago the only salmon I caught on a GB outing was skinny. Big head, no gut.  Seems the bait fish are back."
1075655,Fisherman,2021-08-22 14:46:00,7201,"Ya, down to about 205 and holding.  Lot easier on the back and knees."
1075656,misfish,2021-08-22 16:22:00,29133,You should see him in person. Turns sideways and cant see him . LOL
1075657,Fisherman,2021-08-22 16:36:00,7201,Zipper with its tongue sticking out.
1075662,misfish,2021-08-22 18:48:00,29133,"I have seen nothing but huge fat salmon the past 6-7 years now . Largest I have caught was last year, 26lb hen."
