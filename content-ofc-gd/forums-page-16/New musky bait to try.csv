1075559,Rizzo,2021-08-18 00:48:00,4754,Not surprised! We were on L St Clair that same day with some friends. Between 4 boats I think close to 30 muskies were caught (when you lose track you know it is a lot of fish!). Never thought of trolling a rubber glove but it may have paid off that day!

1075693,Moosebunk,2021-08-25 14:12:00,3970,Ya suppose fingers could like little minners swimming around or fleeing a human.  A muskies mistaken identity for what it thought was an appetizer..
