1075401,Jam-y Mikk,2021-08-09 20:57:00,1,Hello all I am visiting Six Mile for a family vaca.  and will be bringing the fishing/skiing boat.  What is the best place to launch?  We will be up in Hungry Bay. And in general any resources to help find public launches. Cheers all J
1075405,Rizzo,2021-08-09 23:29:00,4754,wow been 30 years since I fished there but we launched at the provincial park when we did. Have a good time!
1075410,Rizzo,2021-08-10 12:58:00,4754,"I do remember that after I launched at the PP, I would just fish along the shoreline to the right. After a couple kms there was a marina in a quiet bay. So this would be on the hwy 400 side of the lake. 6 Mile Lake Marina is what it was called I think (easy name to remember!). Never launched there but I do remember there were some old stumps in the water, or maybe some old dock pilings, that were always good for bass over that way"

1075421,BillM,2021-08-11 05:17:00,17367,I've had no issues using PP's this year for fishing.   The one I use the most has actually been free Mon-Thurs.  No day pass required and free launching

1075428,misfish,2021-08-11 18:30:00,29133,Not the one down the windy rd and you launch off a rock. LOL
