What a hole shot,,,,,,,,,,,,,LMAO . That was on glass waters this morning . The only issue is,the power cord is about 1ft short . So I will splice it and figured since I am going to,I might as well add an in line fuse for safety . So ,what size fuse am I going to need ? Also, is there a meter I can rig up for battery power ?"

1075380,Spiel,2021-08-08 17:04:00,9065,"If you don't know what the top amp draw is for your motor Google it. 	Then get an inline fuse for the rating. 	Also be sure to use the same guage wire if you're extending the length, but don't extend it more than you need."

1075387,DanD,2021-08-08 20:51:00,2223,"Maybe get a 40-50 amp breaker with a reset button? If something accidentally shorts out and after the accident/short is found, push the breaker switch and you're back going again. There are also auto resets that once the short is removed the circuit will be back on line. I would suggest marine type applications. A bit more money but well worth it. You'll not have to worry about spare fuses. Dan."
1075389,John Bacon,2021-08-08 23:31:00,3277,"A 12v motor will draw one amp per pound of thrust.  So, one size up from the number of pounds of thrust should be good."

Just have a jumper wire with alligator clips; so that if whatever short that burnt the link is remedied; you'll have a way to reconnect the circuit and get your ass going again.  Dan."
1075453,AKRISONER,2021-08-12 15:44:00,5558,"Personal experience, my minkotta plug loosened, the wires began slipping out, resistance built up as less and less copper was making a connection, I ran the motor on 10 doing some autocharting for a period of about 8 minutes. my wire lit on fire and melted the insulation and my fuse blew. I got home safely. Was glad the fuse ended up blowing before the fire got bigger in the hull of my boat where I couldn’t see it."
1075462,Garnet,2021-08-13 12:46:00,2056,"My breakers are 50 amp on the battery. I never reset them, just move the wire forward taking the breaker out. They pop easier every time so I replace after the first pop. You can get them at stero shops also. Chewing thick mate weed is where they pop most so not really issue on Simcoe and running them on 100% or high bypass is risky."
1075463,Sinker,2021-08-13 13:24:00,8692,"No plug, no fuse, just straight to the battery. Simple, and effective.

1075527,Garnet,2021-08-17 10:31:00,2056,The breakers at the battery are the weak link. If the troller quits you hope to have light tester or multi meter. Barring that you take back lead off breaker and move to front if troller starts working you can try the little black reset button. I.ve had little success on resetting breaker and they get easier to pop if they rest. i always had spare breaker with me but it was risk reward if I changed it on water but certainly changed it before next tournament day.
1075540,AKRISONER,2021-08-17 19:07:00,5558,"Remember the draw on a TM in heavy wind or in your case attempting to get back to shore is quiet significant. Were talking about high amps with risk of fire, sparks etc etc."
1075555,Garnet,2021-08-17 22:35:00,2056,"And in heavy breeze your troller is popping out of water adds to risk reward. I no a guy that always said with alligater clips I will just unhook them. Finally happen to him ,dburned all the skin off thum and the melted rudder burned fingers close to bone."
