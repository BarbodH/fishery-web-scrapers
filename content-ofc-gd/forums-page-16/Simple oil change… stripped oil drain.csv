1075601,Raycaster,2021-08-19 19:15:00,528,"Just went to finish a oil change on my 2003 Mercury 25hp and as I went to snug up the oil drain plug it stripped! Didn’t crank on it or anything, just wanted hand tight till I could go grab my torque wrench for exact specs. The last thing I want is the boat in the shop for the winter under repair or the hefty bill with it. It was a SIMPLE oil change! Done it many times! Got a Nipissing trip in a few weeks. Ft%#$k. Has Anyone here solved this in past? Quick research - longer bolt, extra washer, insert threads, rubber bolt, gunk. Anyhelp greatly appreciated, "
1075602,Fisherman,2021-08-19 19:23:00,7201,"Did you strip the bolt or the drain hole?   If it's the hole, helicoil it and get the correct bolt to fit."
1075603,Raycaster,2021-08-19 19:53:00,528,"Drain hole. I will look into the helicoil info, thx."
1075608,misfish,2021-08-19 20:45:00,29133,"The only issue will be filings he will get in the bottom end. You will want to flush it out. Filling from the top hole  ,so you push out the fine metal."
1075612,aplumma,2021-08-19 22:22:00,6896,When you helicoil apply grease to the drill bit and drill slow. This will catch the filings as they form. IF the grease melts you are going to fast. Grease the tap as you rethread the hole for the new helicoil. With this method you can drill and tap a sparkplug in a head still installed. For a video look at one for helicoil an aluminum head and you will find one.  Art
1075613,Raycaster,2021-08-19 22:23:00,528,Will definitely watch for filings and probably a double flush! Have to track down exact thread size etc. to figure out what kit to order.
1075615,aplumma,2021-08-19 23:02:00,6896,"Take the bolt to any good auto parts store and they can size it for you. Be warned you are buying a drill bit,tap, and coils. Art"
1075641,Raycaster,2021-08-20 20:23:00,528,My trusty mechanic will do the job next week no problem. He is very reasonable $$$ and said it would be a quick job. By the time I bought the repair kit etc. this figured to be the smartest play. 
1075682,Freshtrax,2021-08-25 03:19:00,2215,Glad you got it sorted... if it's not one thing it's another with boats.
1075705,Raycaster,2021-08-25 18:48:00,528,"Finished today, did a 1/2 fill to hopefully get any extra shaving and then drained again. Refilled full and now ready to go! A couple Lake Ontario runs and then Nipissing in 3 weeks! Need boat in top shape if Cache Bay is fishable."
