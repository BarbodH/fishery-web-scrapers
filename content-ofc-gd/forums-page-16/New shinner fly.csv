Could not get enough bigger fish for a feed, but yet another, tie that catches.  I even took out my ultra light that I was gifted a few years back, maybe more from Porkpie. LOL        Oh the sun rise was amazing this morning. Like a painting. Even the moon looked great, better the the photo anyways.    A side note,I need to get a lithium Ion battery for the new finder,as it draws more power then I thought it would from the 7.2 sealed one I have been using.  I am looking at getting one of those milwhacky converter battery attachments for my 5 hr batteries. I know they work well,as another fellow angler uses that for his set up.  Home depot did not have any when I was there yesterday. Guess it,s on line for one, if I can find it .  "
