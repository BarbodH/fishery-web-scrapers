1075872,georginaisle,2021-09-06 21:15:00,42,I can't find any info...does anybody know if New Liskeard is an unorganized Township?
1075873,BillM,2021-09-06 21:39:00,17367,Don't believe so as it's not listed in either the East or West UNO districts of Timiskaming.    It's also now apart of Temiskaming Shores.
1075875,georginaisle,2021-09-06 21:40:00,42,"Ok,thank you for the reply"
1075903,OhioFisherman,2021-09-07 19:18:00,6623,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timiskaming_District Just from that I would assume organized?
1076052,lakerguy,2021-09-15 22:38:00,224,Depends on the township. We are in the Mowat Landing area and its classed as not organized.
