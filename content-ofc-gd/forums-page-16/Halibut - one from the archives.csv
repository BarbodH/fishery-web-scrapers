The pic below is that of one of his recent catches. You wanna talk Halibut?! LOL HH "
1075574,akaShag,2021-08-18 17:01:00,2073,"AWESOME!!!! The sport fishery maximum allowable length (to keep) is 132 cm, which a 55 to 60 pound fish.  That one is easily double that! Doug"
1075575,AKRISONER,2021-08-18 17:31:00,5558,my uncle caught a 120lber in the 90's. You can no longer keep a fish that size. It was so big they simply dragged it home in the water.

1075605,Sinker,2021-08-19 20:11:00,8692,"A pacific halibut is way at the top of my list. I just want to catch one, clean it, and cook it in the same day. I don't really care how big it is, but of course a huge one would be amazing. I just want to eat one fresh. I've never really been a huge fan of halibut, I find it kind of dry and tough, for fish, but I have never tried it fresh, and trust me, i LOVE eating fresh fish. I planned to go this year, and last, but covid kind of messed it up, so maybe next year.  S."
1075616,akaShag,2021-08-19 23:30:00,2073,"I believe I have eaten fresh halibut, but not one that I caught.  Honestly, I find it no different from the halibut I have frozen in vac packs.  My favourite way to eat it is wrapped in bacon and cooked until it is JUST cooked through, and it is lovely, juicy, flavourful fish.  I am guessing the halibut you have sampled maybe came by way of a commercial fisherman, poorly cared for at the time of the catch, and frozen and shipped, and who knows how long in the freezer before you ate it. Doug"
1075630,Sinker,2021-08-20 16:55:00,8692,"JUST cooked is the key. I have had fresh Atlantic halibut, but it was over cooked. Don't get me wrong, it was fantastic, but a little dry and ""meaty"". The rest is just hte standard fish and chips stuff, that like you said, isn't great. As a matter of fact, I prefer cod if I go for fish and chips anyways. I could eat cod every day lol S."
1075632,akaShag,2021-08-20 17:17:00,2073,"That just brought back a memory.  My first time trying for halibut was in Haines, Alaska.  I was visiting a buddy in Whitehorse, Yukon, and we drove down to Haines for a one-day halibut charter, which was a waste of money.  But we did fish the river for pink salmon, which was a HOOT!  And just downstream of us were a couple grizzly bears, also after the pinks..........😲 ANYWAYS, in the town of Haines we had a meal of fish and chips done up with halibut as the fish part.  I really don't care for ""English style"" battered fish, but this stuff was very tasty indeed.  I might just cook up a meal of that myself........ Doug PS) Yes I like cod too, but I prefer it breaded and pan-fried."
1075634,Headhunter,2021-08-20 17:33:00,5703,"What I learned from my niece  re Halibut is that the 20lb fish are far tastier, less tough then the fish over 50lbs. She also mentioned Pacific Black Cod as a rare catch, but has to be properly cooked (soaked in milk over night) to get the best out of it. When she still lived in Prince Rupert, she would send me a care package packed in dry ice. i must admit that i much prefer fresh water fish to ocean fish and found the cod not to my liking. She also would go crab fishing with him and the pics they had of their catch would set my spit a running! HH "
1075635,akaShag,2021-08-20 17:45:00,2073,"The black cod are also known as sablefish (and butterfish), and some of the folks out west think they are the best of the lot.  But I have never eaten any.  One group of anglers who were there at the same time as us did catch a few of these and kept them I believe.  We caught a couple red snapper, which had to be released immediately, and some other bottomfish (species name forgotten), which also had no open season, but I think the black cod could be kept.  We did not catch any, so I guess I won't be tasting them any time soon. And it is pretty hard to beat a meal of fresh perch or crappies, for sure! Doug"
1075636,gordy28,2021-08-20 18:49:00,638,Awesome - thanks Doug - enjoyed that! Andrew 
1075639,misfish,2021-08-20 20:03:00,29133,Have haddock and fresh cut fries as I read. LOL 
1075695,akaShag,2021-08-25 15:21:00,2073,"I cooked up a feed of pan-fried lingcod (done in Fishcrisp) a couple nights ago.  The fillets turned a lovely golden brown and cooked up perfectly.  Taste and texture were pretty much exactly like English style fish and chips.  Unfortunately, I do not prefer English style fish and chips............🙄 I brought home salmon, halibut, and lingcod but left most of my share of the latter with my buddy who lives on Vancouver Island.  It's his favourite of the three and so it all worked out.

1075703,Moosebunk,2021-08-25 18:40:00,3970,"""Below the boat, down a couple hundred feet, swam a Brobdignagian Behemoth named Bertha.  Bertha BUTT, one of the Butt sisters.  Bertha’s family the Hailbutts came from the wrong side of the current and Bertha looked every one of her twenty-three years.  The family had changed their name when they moved into the Gold River area, but everybody knew very well that the BUTTs were furriners and not to be trifled with.  Bertha was in a foul mood:  her husband Bob Butt, the wastrel, had blown the family’s grocery money on cod cheeks at the Newfie Plaice, that new joint near the island that had servers with fin clips and pouty lips.  “What do those Atlantic floozies have that I don’t?” thought Bertha.  The kids would be whining about Tuna Helper AGAIN, and it had been ages since they had eaten a nice meal of squid or octopus.  Suddenly Bertha detected a delicious aroma:  could that actually be salmon heads?  Yes, for certain!  And also salmon belly and maybe a bit of rotted herring!!!  Bertha quivered with delight and started to follow that delectable trail of scent, salivating at the thought of it all.  Suddenly she saw not one but THREE lovely servings of salmon belly, waving seducingly on the bottom.  She approached the first salmon belly, gave it a loving sniff, opened her mouth and BANG!"" Well done!   I remember bits of this time of yours out west when you passed them along some years ago.  Looking forward to the new story Doug.  Such a way with words... hopefully your way with fish flowed the same this time around, or you at least fought Bertha for a short time before she sunk your boat and you swam ashore. lol"
1075704,akaShag,2021-08-25 18:47:00,2073,"Thanks Bunk.  Yes, that one was fun to write. The 2021 Butt Sister that came up topside for me was about 30 pounds, so not a behemoth by any means, but TASTY!  Buddy caught one 3 cm below the allowable maximum length, and it was 55 to 60 pounds.  Then the tide changed, and all four lines got tangled together in 300 FOW, what a shitshow...

1075714,akaShag,2021-08-26 17:00:00,2073,"Oh, and did I mention, the jigs weighed anywhere between one and two POUNDS, each with a pound or two of salmon head/salmon belly/etc on them.  😲"

And just think of the bass we did not eat, that are still swimming!😉 Doug"
