976319,wormdunker,2016-07-12 17:24:00,1711,Lately I have to sign in every time I visit OFC.  In the past I was always signed in.  Has the site policy changed or is it my lap top has a mind of it's own??
976320,Old Ironmaker,2016-07-12 17:27:00,8243,I have the same problem with other sites but not this one. When you sign in check off the remember me box.
976334,wormdunker,2016-07-12 18:46:00,1711,yup I did that.

976401,wormdunker,2016-07-13 08:35:00,1711,Thanx aplumma - I cleared my history 5 or 6 days ago but still have to sign in every time if I wish to post on this site.  I'll check my settings.
976403,wormdunker,2016-07-13 09:03:00,1711,"Got it fixed!  Thanx guys.  Tools, internet options, browsing history - delete temp files, saved passwords etc., etc.  I unchecked the little box - it's all good now."
976407,manitoubass2,2016-07-13 10:52:00,11391,^^^  Now for that photobucket thingy?
976455,aplumma,2016-07-13 20:29:00,6896,  Copy url paste in text from photobucket works for me here.  Art
976457,wormdunker,2016-07-13 21:06:00,1711,"I have photo bucket on my lap top but cant get it on my IPhone.  Phone is where all my pix are.  I'm wanting to show you guys my walleye from Monday.  27"", 6.3 lbs.  First 1 this year on Erie."
