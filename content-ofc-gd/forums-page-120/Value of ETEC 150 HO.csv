975016,Rizzo,2016-06-27 22:25:00,4754,"if your current motor has given you no grief I am also of the opinion of sticking with it. Why fix what ain't broke! Yes you can spend 9000 and have a warranty...but if your new motor is a lemon your boat will sit in the shop. Sure its covered by warranty but what comfort is that when its sitting high and dry in the marina. Just because something is new doesn't mean it will be trouble free, might have been made on a Friday by guys looking forward to the week-end. Now if your current motor is very unreliable and IS a  lemon...then yes, go for it and hope the new one treats you well"
975031,aplumma,2016-06-27 23:40:00,6896,Have the shop do an analysis on the motor this fall and give you an honest opinion. On board computers can be read. Plugs and compression would tell you how healthy your motor is. I have motorcycles and cars from the 70;s that run like clockwork.   Art
975032,ecmilley,2016-06-27 23:51:00,2163,I would say for a value of 5500 6000. The e tecs didn't have a great reputation for reliability most of the boats I see for sale with e techs mention new powerhead still under warranty. BRP=BRING RINGS & PISTONS

975040,landry,2016-06-28 01:28:00,1005,Spending 9000 to buy a warranty costs you about 2000 a year. You will not see repairs that costly over the next 5 years with your current motor. But - when I get my mind on something or start worrying  - I often cannot turn another direction so I get it.

Agreed Landry, sounds like me LOL.  You (and others that have responded) are right with the math, possibly the only benefit is that after five years the entire package may be worth a bit more with a 2017 engine as opposed to a 2010...but I realize not $9,000 more."

I wasn't replacing it because I had to, I was replacing it because I wanted a new fuel efficient 4 stroke. In fact I sold my old engine to a fella in one of the communities North of here and he is running it on his boat. Got a good buck for it too. Mind you it was sold with controls and cables, 2 props, specialty tools and repair manual plus even used outboards tend to hold their value well here.  Love my new 4 stroke and it is paired with Smartcraft gauges which are awesome.  "

It is the least of my maintenance concerns, never had a problem since I have owned it going on 9 years. Good fuel, regular maintenance turn key and go. The guy that had it before me actually kept every receipt from oil to plugs since new. The Stator was the only major thing during the time he owned it. I don't get wanting a new engine every few years so one can sleep at night. Heck my wife's 07 Nissan Altima just hit 300,000 KMS, never an issue since new and is in showroom condition. I sleep well at night."

It has over 800 hrs on it and it still runs strong without any issues.  It starts with the first crank in both cold and hot weather.  It has never overheated and still pulls strong. I don't abuse my motor by running it full throttle.  One important thing to do is to make sure you do the maintenance on a regular schedule.  I follow the 3 yr or 300 hour service interval. Save yourself the $12,000+ I'm sure you can find a better use for your money....."

The price of new boats has gone from unaffordable to insane, and this boat does everything we want, so I am considering selling the outboard motor and re-powering to either the upcoming Mercury Pro-XS 150 four-stroke or the G2 ETEC 150 HO.  I am having some difficulty in coming up with an asking price for this engine.  My dealer already has a slightly used 2014 ETEC 150 in the showroom and doesn't want mine on trade.  It is a 2010, approximately 250 hours, never tournament fished, and has led an easy life.  It is in very good condition, with a 24"" Raker II prop, BRP concealed throttle, oil tank, and has all BRP services done with the exception of the three-year gearcase oil change...I am old school and have changed it out every fall.  It also had a second replaceable water-separating filter with canister added to the boat, as I know ethanol/water is not good for these direct-injected two-strokes.  Can anyone suggest what this engine might be worth before I list it in the next couple months?  "

I agree to an extent Brian B, I wasn't real pleased after talking to them about this, I was also quoted over $16,000 on a current Mercury 150 four-stroke, which I assume is full MSRP, especially how they know how fussy I am and how I take care of my stuff.  Having said that, I am willing to extend a bit of a ""mulligan"" to this dealer, I and my family have dealt there since the 1960's,and they have been very good to me.  Not always the best price, but the best service.  Having said that, when it comes time for me to move ahead with this, I'd pay more within reason for the new engine but I won't be paying MSRP from anyone...and I always shop around to make sure I am being treated fairly."

I am becoming more and more sold on the four-stroke, I am on my third Ski-Doo 1200cc four-stroke and have no intention of going back to a two-stroke sled.  I'm not the Al Gore tree-hugging forest fairy type whatsoever, I'm just liking the smooth running low maintenance and other characteristics of the four-strokes, and they hold their value better.  I don't like keeping something until it is worth nothing.  My Stratos and ETEC have been babied, and the boat just suits us for the fishing that we do, its in mint condition.  Seems like a waste to spend the amount of money to ""upgrade"" to a new package (how we got to a point where $40,000 plus for a well equipped 17.5 aluminum boat with a 115 is beyond me).  I've upgraded the electronics to Humminbird 859's, and will soon be selling the Minn Kota 80 lb iPilot and upgrade to a new one."

They're in production now and will be in dealer showrooms by late October - early November.  I spent most of yesterday driving some early production models of each, before the official unveiling at the Wisconsin Center last night. The 150 has a ton of torque, and the 150 H.O. is almost on par with the 175. Same coloured side panels as the original G2s, plus now you can get it in camo.

The new engine will come off warranty in a few years too; then you will be back to square one.
