976042,adempsey,2016-07-10 02:14:00,1498,Monkeypuzzle tree?
976043,dave524,2016-07-10 02:22:00,4508,"Monkeypuzzle tree?  That would be my guess, looks like the drought got to it ."
976044,Kawartha Kev,2016-07-10 02:30:00,281,I think that is what it is from what some of my other friends told me also shame if it died because of the drought they are rare and not very hardy in that area but by the size of it you can tell it has lived for a while.  Kawartha Kev
976051,dave524,2016-07-10 10:52:00,4508,I recall seeing a few specimens way back when I took Dendrology in an arboretum setting where they would have had winter protection. Pretty sure the Niagara Parks Commission has a few in the greenhouse at the falls.
976152,bigugli,2016-07-11 02:20:00,6138,Definitely not a normal specimen for our zones. Could not be sure myself if it was an araucaria or related to an aralia
976175,grimsbylander,2016-07-11 15:51:00,3016,Maybe Niagara-on-the-lake hasn't gotten around to picking up the Christmas trees yet?
976177,GBW,2016-07-11 15:57:00,8460,"Maybe Niagara-on-the-lake hasn't gotten around to picking up the Christmas trees yet? HAHAHAHAHA, well played!"
976179,fishing n autograph,2016-07-11 16:50:00,2540,That looks like a painful switch lol....
