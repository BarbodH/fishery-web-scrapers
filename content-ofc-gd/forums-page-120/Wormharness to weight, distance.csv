975737,misfish,2016-07-06 20:08:00,29133,"What distance do you guys use from your drag weight to your harness?( Im sure I,ll get lots of preferences)Also, has anyone ever tried running two of them? I mean like say one is 2 ft up from the wieght,the other like 4 or 5 above that.  Thanks"
975740,Sinker,2016-07-06 20:33:00,8692,"I mostly use a 1/4 oz egg weight above my harness. I make my harnesses about 2ft. This will run no problem up to 14 or so feet. Deeper than that i use a bigger weight.  For bottom bouncers i tie my harnesses about 4ft. I dont use bouncers unless its deeper than 15ft, or the bottom has steep structure.  Never tried 2...wheels are turning now...lol  S."
975741,misfish,2016-07-06 20:46:00,29133,"I,ll be tying a bell sinker on the bottom and just be slow rolling the baldes ( using the toon, but I can get a good speed going using the flippers, even much more using the oars, just ask Terry) LOL   Never tried 2...wheels are turning now...lolS.  I,ll let ya know how it works bud. I just thought of covering more water colume. Im sure it would be effective. That would be a total of 4 hooks for my set up."
975743,dave524,2016-07-06 22:22:00,4508,"I always used Gapen Bait Walkers with a 3-4 foot leader to the harness, relatively snag proof on rocky bottoms"
975749,mike rousseau,2016-07-06 22:50:00,4661,4 foot
975751,Old Ironmaker,2016-07-06 22:52:00,8243,"Trolling in a Toon. Man those feet must just be pumping along. I used to dive and have U.S. Diver fins, what type of fin do you use Brian? As far as harnesses it depends on the length of harness. 3 feet behind a Dipsy Diver or Jet Diver. For bottom bouncing no more than 24"". Since I moved out here shallow is 40 feet."
975752,Terry,2016-07-06 22:54:00,14456,fins or oars
975754,bigugli,2016-07-06 23:00:00,6138,I use a 1/4 oz bullet a foot ahead of the harness.

You would be surprised how good I can move. I bought a set of deep divers this year at a garage sale. They get me moving pretty well. If I want to use the oars, I can get a good 12-14 ft between strokes. And thats not pushing it hard.The toon glides with ease."
975759,porkpie,2016-07-06 23:54:00,2521,"24 to 48 inches.  Generally around 36.  Never tried to run one above the other, let us know how it works!"
975766,ecmilley,2016-07-07 01:06:00,2163,The fish will tell u. Use rubber core sinkers in weights up to 3/8 and bottom.bouncers from 3/4 1.5 all depends on blades lead where u want the harness.in the column or it its a floater harness. Most common 1/4 rubber core 24 inches ahead of blades for me or 15 ft use bottom boincer on 3/4 and water over 20use 1.5
975768,Joeytier,2016-07-07 01:27:00,3990,Yep.
975783,Sinker,2016-07-07 13:26:00,8692,"So, like a 3 way rig? Sounds like a tangle waiting to happen lol  I find they slide through weeds better with an egg weight or worm weight in line with the harness about 2ft above.  If not that way, I'm using a bottom bouncer with a 4 ft harness. 1 ounce per 10ft of depth minimum.  S."
975792,netminder,2016-07-07 15:02:00,514,"trial and error for me usually. I believe most of my harnesses are 36"" and I just put weight on until I can feel bottom or I'm tickling to tops of the weeds. I usually like to let out at least 50' of line, and put the weight, usually split shot, just above the swivel where I attach the harness. I've never been a fan of bottom bouncers either.  two harnesses just sounds like a nasty mess waiting to happen, but try it and tell us how it works!"
975795,LeXXington,2016-07-07 15:34:00,1928,Used a high / low rig a few times with a 3-way swivel.  floating harness on the top.  short lead  (Watch the number of hooks)  worm harness on the lower.  heavier weight needed
975804,fishboy,2016-07-07 18:36:00,550,"I usually run about 3' above the spinner blade on my harnesses, troll at about 1mph and use the amount of weight for my bottom bouncer that has my line running at a 45 degree angle  from the rod."
975805,glenner,2016-07-07 19:05:00,56,I am trolling in about 11-14 feet tight to weed beds so I use a 1/4 oz. keel sinker in front of a 3 foot harness. I find the keel sinkers get through the weeds better.
975806,kickingfrog,2016-07-07 19:07:00,8333,"I almost always use a lead on my harnesses of 3 to 2  feet. The type of bottom cover will factor in as well as how heavy your rig is, how fast you're moving and how much lift your blade (or blades) give the harness. The general rule of thumb is an ounce of weight for every 10 feet of depth."
975813,Old Ironmaker,2016-07-07 20:53:00,8243,"If you want I have a pair of professional U.S. Diver fins for you. Let me know. Size large, 10 to 13. I have 2 pair."

975817,mike rousseau,2016-07-07 21:08:00,4661,In current double that
975818,misfish,2016-07-07 21:15:00,29133,"I,ll just be dragging along weed lines. Should be good with my planned set up. The double set up of the harness was just a thought to try, and try I will. If it get all screwwed up, I,ll just cut it,bag it, and go single. No harm in trying. Like I said, it would be a 4 hook set up, so legal.  Thanks guys."
976754,fishindevil,2016-07-16 15:20:00,6254,I use a 1.5oz bouncer in the Ottawa river which had lots of current up to 30ft with no problems keep the angle and slow down till you feel the bottom .... Been using them for over 20yrs ...... Sometimes in the fall will go to a 2oz but never more than that .... It works just have to refine it and deadly way to catch bottom hugging eyes as well as Muskies you name it .... ???
976774,Joeytier,2016-07-16 20:28:00,3990,"Killer on specks and splake too, just run a couple split shot instead of a bouncer."
