976161,wormdunker,2016-07-11 05:52:00,1711,Nice rig Bernie.  I still remember the old cedar strips on Nipissing back in the 60s.  My father would rent one in Callandar when up there on vacation.
975661,Bernie,2016-07-05 23:23:00,3190,"A couple years ago, maybe more, I began plans to fix up a boat to install twin engines on. Over time I gathered up pats and pieces, engines and finally a boat. Originally twin 18HP were the plan but the 1955 25HP electric starts came together first. The boat is a 1984 16ft cedar strip, same model as my first boat in 1975. Turned out ok.   "
975663,BassMan11,2016-07-05 23:36:00,583,Super cool. You don't see that everyday. Nice work!
975673,Freshtrax,2016-07-06 01:30:00,2215,"Nice,  we're going to try and wrap up our Giesler resto this winter.   Dads retiring so that will help"
975677,kickingfrog,2016-07-06 01:57:00,8333,Any chance we could hear those twins?
975679,leaf4,2016-07-06 02:00:00,2466,"That looks like fun, I love the look of those old motors"
975683,2 tone z71,2016-07-06 02:11:00,1311,They must hum a nice tune in sync..well done looks great
975684,John Bacon,2016-07-06 02:17:00,3277,Nice motors.  My dad had the same engine (only one) on his cedar strip boat in the early 70s.I didn't think that they were still making cedar strip boats in 1984.
975688,wkrp,2016-07-06 02:54:00,656,Far F'N  out
975689,Freshtrax,2016-07-06 03:02:00,2215," Bernies family still makes them today,  and they are affordable compared to an aluminum.   I'm often tempted to pick up a new 18 ft .  http://www.gieslerboats.ca/"
975696,porkpie,2016-07-06 10:34:00,2521,Nice rig!
975697,Bernie,2016-07-06 11:01:00,3190,"Thanks guys. Kickingfrog, I have a video but it's mostly fingers. Trying to operate two things at once. "
975714,Headhunter,2016-07-06 14:36:00,5703,Nice job Bernie! Now get out in the boat with your drone and do some filming/flying! HH
975734,Joeytier,2016-07-06 19:21:00,3990,Very cool!  Great work.
975762,Steelheadphycho,2016-07-07 00:21:00,470,Ok?  That's a dream rig Bernie!  Nice work man!
975763,kickingfrog,2016-07-07 00:53:00,8333,"Thanks guys. Kickingfrog, I have a video but it's mostly fingers. Trying to operate two things at once.    Thanks Bernie."
975781,Moosebunk,2016-07-07 12:53:00,3970,Any chance we could hear those twins?  Read my mind!  Very cool work away from your work Bernie.
975785,jimmer,2016-07-07 13:38:00,2730,That's a beauty combo!
975786,Spiel,2016-07-07 13:47:00,9065,"That's super cool Bernie. Love the twins, must scoot pretty good."
975794,Old Ironmaker,2016-07-07 15:30:00,8243,"A real head turner, nice, really nice Bernie."
975812,aplumma,2016-07-07 20:18:00,6896,I would say nice boat Bernie but so far I haven't seen a bad build from you yet. Keep up the good work as usual.   Art
975829,Bernie,2016-07-07 23:12:00,3190,Thank you again for your kind comments. I'll try to get some better pics when I get back home. It does scoot along fairly well but need to check RPM to get proper propellers. Think the ones on them now are more suited for 40hp.
976026,bigbuck,2016-07-10 00:21:00,2449,Very nice Bernie!! Twin okd school O/Bull. Sweet rig.
976027,davey buoy,2016-07-10 00:26:00,5505,Nicely done a said!!!!!! Looks great !
976029,glen,2016-07-10 00:52:00,2641,Reminds me of a 15hp evinrude 1955. That I had. Great motor. I always wantsed a boat with twins.   Looks great.
976061,Sinker,2016-07-10 13:59:00,8692,"Sweet ride Bernie! My dad loves those old boats. He also builds boats, but nothing like that!  S."
