975373,Joeytier,2016-07-01 23:57:00,3990," I've seen my favourite band In Flames from Sweden, going on 13 times since I started listening to them in grade 9, they are going on 24 years as a band and have 11 albums, they've gone from a very specific sound/genre they helped pioneer called melodic death metal to a lot more easy to listen to music in public... sometimes lol I would have gone to see them in the mid-90's (Jester Race era) but now...yikes.  I used to like Soundtrack to Your Escape when I was a young gaffer, hasn't aged so well hehe"
975386,DRIFTER_016,2016-07-02 03:34:00,10439,One of the neatest shows I have been to was in a gravel parking lot in Barbados. Tiger a DJ from Jamaica was doing a gig and my buddies and I watched it from a roof top next door. We had the chairs out and de rum was flowin' maaaan!!!

976677,netminder,2016-07-15 21:05:00,514,"I haven't been to too many concerts but the first one I went to was probably the most memorable too. Went to see the Foo Fighters on their One by One tour when I was 16 or so at Arrow Hall by the airport. No seating just a huge hall and a stage. Completely unknown to anyone there (other than the band and the crew) they decided to film their Everywhere But Home DVD. My most vivid memory is the start of the show when the first few muted guitar licks from ""All My Life"" started playing and just getting swept up in a wave of humanity and getting pushed towards the stage. Oh, and crowd surfing is a lot of fun!  The next concert/festival I'm looking forward to is Riverfest. There's a bus stop around the corner from my house that takes you to the gate, and there is a pile of awesome bands playing there this year (Sheepdogs FTW)"

Pretty cool to see ACDC, Rush, The guess who, blue rodeo and the rolling stones in one day. Not too shabby at all. I remember seeing a lot of boobs that day and for a 14 year old boy, thats pretty awesome.  Once I hit college then i really started going to a lot of hip hop shows...the heads here will appreciate the fact that i went to rock the bells 08  Saw the roots, cypress hill, wu tang clan, meth and red, blackstar, cage, mr lif, murs, brother ali, and to top it all off Rage Against the Machine closed the night.  Best shows ive ever been to? El-p and Killer Mike on the cancer for cure/rap music tour and people under the stairs in 09-10??  Also Action bronson and Danny Brown on the too high to die tour was incredible as well. Damn so many shows its hard to remember them all."

Best show I've witnessed was Iron Maiden on their 'Somewhere in Time' tour, I think 2009?  Saw them twice more after that and they're always mind-blowing.  Saw Motorhead at the OHL arena in Oshawa few years back.  Lame crowd, sound sucked, band wasn't into it.  Very disappointing, wish I could have seen them in a bar, where they belong!  Seen Megadeth twice, mediocre as hell both times...YAWN  Used to attend underground metal shows frequently...most memorable was Absu at the Annex Wreckroom a few years back...oww my neck  Saw a few shows at Massey, Matt Good (great set for an arrogant prick), Deep Purple (sans Richie Blackmore, Ian Gillan in a cast still sounded fabulous well into his 60's), went to see Colin James a couple times there when I was young, never liked his music but he is a great live performer and excellent guitarist.  Kyuss reunion at the Sound Academy was amazing!  Michael Gira and Swans was the most loudest, most spell-binding musical experience I've ever witnessed, and I doubt very much that will ever be topped."

Musta been, what, 1992, 93'ish? Talk about a funky performance Maceo brings. And an incredible venue to see that funk.   some highlights i remember are queens of the stone age at the el mocambo before they made it big, suicidal tendencies/napalm death at the concert hall in the early 90s was propably the most energetic show i've seen. dri and sepultura at the apocalypse club (what a hole!) -- must've been 89 or 90. gwar (hahaha), a lot of hardcore bands (sick of it all, agnostic front, madball etc). seen a lot of bands.

Saw them a couple years ago at the ACC with some clients. It was ""dress up night""... audience is as crazy as the band is  My wife and I have tickets for the Hip show here in Hamilton...I think I'm going to give my ticket to one of my wifes girlfriends...not sure that is a scene that I want to be part of....  however, the drive to Bobcaygeon sounds like a good idea."

I've been to a few hundred concerts....music is the only thing I enjoy more than fishing....or at least ""as much"".  My first concert was The Who, 1996 (was 16 years old).  My best concert was December 31, 1999.  Phish.  Ole Seminal Indian Reservation in the Florida Everglades. After 3 sets on the 30th, Phish came out on the 31st, played a set from 4 until 6pm. Then they left, came back on at Midnight.  The played from Midnight until SUNRISE without STOPPING ONCE! (yes, that is 7.5 HOURS STRAIGHT)  It was the ""encore"" to the 20th century.  Since than I've been to countless shows, but the feeling I had at midnight, Millennium New Years Eve, dancing in the Everglades to my favourite band...it was a magical experience that will never ever be topped.  Other notable mentions:  - Neil Young 3 night run at Massey Hall - Primus at the Danforth - Pearl Jam with Neil Young at ACC - Springsteen on his last tour before the passing of Clarence Clemens - Roger Waters on the most recent ""Wall Tour"" (seen Roger three times but that was the best) - David Gilmour from most recent tour. (better live than Roger)    I'm also a HUGE jazz fan, seeing guys like Pat Metheny, Herbie Hancock, Victor Wooten, Oscar Peterson, John McLaughlin, etc were all life highlights.  Seeing the ""Quintet"" reunion at Massey Hall in 2003 was likely the most ""significant"" (historically) concert I've attended."
