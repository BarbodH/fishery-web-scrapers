977153,Dara,2016-07-20 19:16:00,3052,Aren't you supposed to have a safety rope on it if it isn't through bolted?
977154,akaShag,2016-07-20 19:22:00,2073,"Aren't you supposed to have a safety rope on it if it isn't through bolted? If that thing had been roped on, it probably would have come back around and smacked him in the head.................  ...............but when I had smaller outboards, for sure, I used to have them securely attached to the boat with a strong cable and locking padlock - against loss and theft both.  Of course, well-prepared thieves just bring heavy-duty bolt cutters."
977155,Korber,2016-07-20 19:53:00,79,The recovery was just as cool lol !
977157,Craigson,2016-07-20 20:19:00,117,"Def a setup, you can see a blue strap is tied to the motor and to somewhere near the front of the boat  Hmm on another look maybe not? Or there was a strap n it broke? Weird"
