976434,Blue Lk,2016-07-13 16:49:00,337,"I hope you don't mind if I add this to your thread Wormduncker These ""eaters"" were the result of a coupe hours of not too serious fishing. We spent more time visiting over a few beers. "
976497,wormdunker,2016-07-14 06:41:00,1711,"Awesome photo of your catch.  Most of mine were the eater size 16"" - 19"".  I did manage a couple @  22 &23"" but the bigger ones were released.  Strange how socializing & beer drinking is part of a fishing trip!!"
975925,wormdunker,2016-07-08 20:12:00,1711,"I recently returned from Ear Falls from one of my most memorable fishing trips ever!  It all started May 16 when I received a call from the operators union hall for a crane operator at the New Gold mine site near Rainy River On.  I departed home May 18 to start work May 20.  It's a 22 hour drive from Fonthill to Rainy River.   I was driving along in great anticipation of starting the new job but, more importantly I had packed a lot of my fishing gear.  I arrived in the town of Emo which is very close to the job site but also home of one of our more popular members -Manitoubass.  I phoned Rick enroute & was fortunate to meet up with him prior to heading to the job site.  We met up in the parking lot of the Emo Inn - the only motel/bar in town.  I departed shortly after with an agreement to meet up to wet a line.  Awesome!  My work schedule was 14/7, 14 days working 10 hour shifts, then 7 days off.  My first week off I flew home to Niagara via Thunder Bay to Toronto.  My plan was to fish near Lake of the Woods/ Kenora area upon my return.  I worked another 14 days straight & during that time I made plans to fish Ear Falls.  I found Kenora to be extremely expensive to rent a camp & rent a boat & motor.  Some prices quoted were in the $1500.00 - $2,000.00 range & up from there.  I was advised to try the Ear Falls area & was pleasantly surprised to find a nice lodge, good cabins, 17' Lund boats equipped with 40 hp Yammys, padded, swivel seats fully equipped with fish finders for $630.00 for 1 week!  Woo Hoo!  I checked in to the camp June 25, & departed Saturday July 2.  I previously invited Manitoubass to join me for a couple of days to fish the famous English river.  His work schedule was a little tight coupled with a last minute health issue caused this meeting to not happen.  While I was fishing the English River I realised in short order this place was a walleye factory.  First morning 8 walleye in the range of 16 -18"" were landed.  I kept 2 for the frying pan.  Every morning & every evening I was very fortunate to land 8 - 15 walleye!  Another Woo Hoo!!  Most walleye are nice healthy chunky fish measuring 16- 20"" with a few up to 24"".  I was able to land a couple 22"" & 1 @ 23"".   I consumed walleye at least once per day during my stay.  The choice of bait was a simple 3/8 oz jig with either a live leech of a yellow twister tail.  My favourite bait on the northern lakes is a perch colored ""go getter"" tipped with a leech.  This presentation did land many walleye.  My final evening of fishing I decided to try one of the original floatin rapalas black/silver.  Wow!  This proved to be a very good move.  Nice 20"" chunky walleye each pass near the dam.  I landed 10 nice specimens in less than 2 hours.  As I released the last fish, kissed it, & thanked him for all the fun!  I think I landed at least 60 - 75 walleye while fish the great English River.  Many photos shown down a few posts courtesy of Manitoubass."
975940,manitoubass2,2016-07-08 20:49:00,11391,"I have regrets man. What a literal kick in the balls.  It truly was my pleasure meeting ya and hanging out a few times!!! Your a great dood!  And for the record, Brian sent me a walleye pic a beer pic and a supper pic numerous times daily while I was at work???  I found that hilarious but im just glad you had a great stay, got on some fish and found a great place to do it!!!  Hopefully ""next time"" comes sooner rather than later?"
975954,Old Ironmaker,2016-07-08 23:22:00,8243,"A great report Brian. I even believe you without fotos. Where's the HD pics? That would be Heaven after all that waiting time reading the paper to make a lift a few times a day, maybe. I used to say I think it would be cheaper to have the Hoisting Engineer to standby at the Airport and fly him up for each lift!!!!  Re: rentals. I rented a cottage 25 years ago on Nippising and they charged us $800.00 for the week and $750.00 for an 17'aluminum with a 15HP elec start. Very nice place and a great boat, Cozy Cove Cottages, and great Walleye then. On the way back I told Ticha "" we are buying a cottage and a boat next year"" and I did, so the price wasn't really that crazy 25 years latter. It took a few years to get the right boat though, 18 actually.  I know of this Manitou guy, he has been known to be a no show. Like last summers visit to the Hammer, no show, eh Richard?"
975969,manitoubass2,2016-07-09 01:44:00,11391,"Hey, that was a long shot as it was my wifes work trip hahaha.  I seem to remember, more recently, someone missed out on an OFC wing night???  Ring a bell???"
975970,wormdunker,2016-07-09 01:49:00,1711,"Manitoubass is going to post some pix for me - I'm computer challenged!  Might be tomorrow, he had a busy day of golf today!!  LOL!"
975972,manitoubass2,2016-07-09 02:42:00,11391, Pics will be up soon. Uploading to photobucket now!
975981,manitoubass2,2016-07-09 03:52:00,11391,"First met Brian quickly at the Emo in for a quick chat as soon as he arrived    A few days later we both had enough time for a quick chat over some cold ones, again, at the Emo inn    Apperently we think alike. Brian shows at my place for a visit and like any gentleman, brings a 6 pack of cold ones! Little did he know, I was already prepared and had bought us a 6 pack???    Brians arrives and we take a drive in the Ford to Rainy River First Nations (Manitou) and snap a quick pic to prove it. Time for a walk to the rapids and show him my bass spot?    Apon arrival we see our first fish! The might aurora!!! The timing couldnt be better...     ???  This is a very sacred place. Posing at the ""turtlehead"" rock    The manitou rapids...     I had brought in a few lbs of smoked sturgeon for the boys at work. Since brian was staying at camp and met my driller, Walter, I sent some for Brian to try    Cont'd"
975983,manitoubass2,2016-07-09 04:09:00,11391,"So apperently Brian has had enough of work and tells his boss were to stick a jig...  He arrives in Ear Falls for the week.  These are the txts I receive while im at work, which made me jealous and very happy for him at the same time.  But first, His first LOTWs walleye! Scratched off the bucket list!    Brian isnt much of a photographer???  So enjoy the boat floor and some fish pics!  Nice healthy northern    Then I get these when im working in the scorching heat (kinda wanted to kill you)      Chunky walleye, cleaned in what Brian flaunted as one of the best cleaning stations hes seen    3 fish in the am! A guys gotta eat!     Perfect stringer!  "
975985,manitoubass2,2016-07-09 04:18:00,11391,"  Chunky gal!      And more!    A rare glimpse of the ""wormdunker""    Back to the fish!    World class cleaning station    World class eaters    Mmmmmm food    The boat floor???      Refueling....      Lil fatty! Gorgeous walleye?    At this point I fired back with this...???      Catchin fish is hard work, like golfing. Sometimes ya just need a cold one...    I hope ya all enjoy? Id say ya did just dandy bud!!!"
975987,wormdunker,2016-07-09 11:13:00,1711,"Thanx Rick for posting pix of my trip.  You did a great job!  I have to practice selfies with my fish.  I was solo on this trip so I chose the boat floor as my background.  LOL!  In many cases it was a quick photo & a quick release.  At this camp they promote C & R.  Any walleye over 18"" must be released.  On Long Bow Lake near Kenora you must release pike over 26""."
976035,manitoubass2,2016-07-10 01:22:00,11391,"Im thinkin of making this a destination next year. I miss ear falls, and its one helluva deal!  Hilarious nobody even posted in here.  So much for fishing reports(its even got beer and food in in???)"
976056,Blue Lk,2016-07-10 12:37:00,337,"There is a good reason this area sees 1000's of American fishermen every year,the fishing just gets better & better.I spend a couple days a week at a tackle shop & on any given saturday we will licence well over 100 fishermen heading up Hwy 105 to the Ear Falls/Lac Seul area.Yesterday I met guys from Texas,Arizona,California and lots of states in between. I rarely see anybody from southern ont & find it hard to believe that more of them don't visit this scenic fishing meca."
976063,wormdunker,2016-07-10 14:03:00,1711,"Wow!  Amazing report Blue Lk.  It is truly a scenic paradise with so many fishing opportunities.  The owner of the lodge I was at states -  only 2% of his clients are from southern Ont.  While I was there license plates from Iowa, Michigan & Wisconsin.  The guys from Michigan travelled 17 hours to Ear Falls!  There must be at least 50 lodges/camps with billboards advertising their camp along  hwy 105."
976068,leaf4,2016-07-10 14:31:00,2466,Sweeeeeet pics!
976076,manitoubass2,2016-07-10 15:35:00,11391,Nobody looked at you weird for buying/drinking beer?  When I worked there I constantly got grilled for drinking beer.  Thats big time whisky country lol
976084,can u fish,2016-07-10 17:10:00,326,Got to like it when you can work in a little fishing  with your work assignment  thanks for the report and photos.  Cheers Mitch
976139,chris.brock,2016-07-10 23:47:00,4053,"I don't know if ""popular"" is the right word  Great story and great little hook up guys. Walleye city up there.  What's the story with the mighty Aurora pic?"
976153,bigugli,2016-07-11 02:25:00,6138,Sounds like the ideal working arrangement. Great report.
976154,wdodgetruck,2016-07-11 02:55:00,27,Ear Falls area is a awesome place to go fishing . I have taken my family there several times. We always stay at  Women River Camp . The owner are great . Paul is from Southwestern Ontario. I can't believe that more people from Ontario don't take advantage of this resource we have here . Most times we our the only Canadians in the camp. Glad you enjoyed it .
976155,Joeytier,2016-07-11 04:02:00,3990,Awesome report.  You're not alone with the old faithful go-getters and original rapalas
976157,wormdunker,2016-07-11 05:24:00,1711,"I'm a believer in the old original rapalas, gold/black & the silver/black.  After this recent trip you can bet I'll be using them more often.  I'm heading out on Erie today.  Gonna give the Rapalas a try.  I've always used harnesses on Erie & sometimes a Live Target smelt, jointed with great success. Chris - I'm not sure of the Aurora trout pic."
976162,manitoubass2,2016-07-11 10:31:00,11391," Chris, the aurora is just a random pic I threw in cause I thought it was funny and made no sense. All we have here is splake and lakers(for trout)"
976257,pics,2016-07-12 03:02:00,1268,Looks like an awesome place... a lot of southern Ontario guys think that Nipissing is the far North so I'm not surprised there aren't many that go up there. Tonight at work I told the guys I traveled 8 hours north to fish and not one of them has ever been that far. More fish for us I guess..
976265,spincast,2016-07-12 09:16:00,3279,Cool report; - just came back from there on Saturday. Some incredible fishing available up that way. If only it was just a little closer....
976268,wormdunker,2016-07-12 10:53:00,1711,Spincast - What camp did you stay at?  I was at Little Canada Camp right near the dam on the English River.  Collin & his son Cole were very friendly & helpful.  I would definitely stay at their camp again.  I fished mostly around the dam but others in the camp were heading downstream somewhere & returning with very nice catches of fish. I tried the quote feature but it didn't work.
