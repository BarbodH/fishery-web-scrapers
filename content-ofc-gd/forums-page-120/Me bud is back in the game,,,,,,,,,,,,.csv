976006,Terry,2016-07-09 19:16:00,14456,I think after they get to 5 years people should test them under controlled conditions every year
976007,Sinker,2016-07-09 19:20:00,8692,"Cool Video Terry, and nice fish.  Always good to test the floater suit out. I do every year just for the hell of it. They are awkward to swim in for sure. Designed to keep your face out of the water, so swimming on your back is easier.  S."
