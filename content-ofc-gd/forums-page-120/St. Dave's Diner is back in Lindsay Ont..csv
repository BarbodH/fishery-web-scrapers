Seeing as how we had a couple of hours to kill after Maribeth had her second cataract operation we ran down to St. Dave's...Still the same great meals !  Congrats to Dave and his staff for all the effort they put into preparing and opening the new diner...  A further congrats to Dave for losing 175 lbs...I had to ask our waitress for confirmation that that was him...(I'm envious)"
