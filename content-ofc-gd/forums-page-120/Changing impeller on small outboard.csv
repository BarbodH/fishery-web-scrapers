975998,bassmaster4,2016-07-09 18:26:00,801,"Hey guys my impeller in my merc seems to be done, when running the motor im not getting any water spitting out. I have a couple of questions is it possible that the hose may be clogged up with sand or a small pebble or something? The motor is 3 years old, i have no experience working on outboards but consider myself to be pretty handy. Ive watched a couple of videos on how to do it but they dont show the steps involved really. Just wondering if anyone on here has ever done it and could give me a bit of a run down on the steps and procedure. It would be much appreciated. Thanks in advance"
975999,porkpie,2016-07-09 18:28:00,2521,Run some weedeater line through the tell take first.  They clog often.  My honda 50 has such a small telltale that I have to clean it every couple of trips.  It's worth a shot!
976000,bassmaster4,2016-07-09 18:30:00,801,"The tell take being the vent? That sucks the water through the motor? Sorry my terminology is weak.  Edit sorry i misread your reply, thanks for the tip"
976002,misfish,2016-07-09 18:33:00,29133,Check the out port (pee hole). Wasps love to go in there.
976008,Sinker,2016-07-09 19:25:00,8692,"Yeah, check the pick up on the foot of the motor, and also run some weed whacker line up the pee hole. More than likely its just plugged with something.  S."
976024,ecmilley,2016-07-09 23:49:00,2163,Give the pee hole a cleaning first. 3 years on a merc impellor getting there anyway there pretty easy to change

976122,chris.brock,2016-07-10 21:40:00,4053," I did my first impeller with help from Youtube. I wasn't too tough. The trickiest part was getting the linkage back together properly so it would shift normally.  If reaming out your pee hole doesn't work, I'd say give it a shot. You can always bring it to a pro if you get buggered up."
