976226,Big Cliff,2016-07-11 21:53:00,6899," I was sent this and it is well worth the time reading it.  Thank you Officer Jay Stalien  Author of the cut and paste below. I have come to realize something that is still hard for me to understand to this day. The following may be a shock to some coming from an African American, but the mere fact that it may be shocking to some is prima facie evidence of the sad state of affairs that we are in as Humans. I used to be so torn inside growing up. Here I am, a young African-American born and raised in Brooklyn, NY wanting to be a cop. I watched and lived through the crime that took place in the hood. My own black people killing others over nothing. Crack heads and heroin addicts lined the lobby of my building as I shuffled around them to make my way to our 1 bedroom apartment with 6 of us living inside. I used to be woken up in the middle of the night by the sound of gun fire, only to look outside and see that it was 2 African Americans shooting at each other. It never sat right with me. I wanted to help my community and stop watching the blood of African Americans spilled on the street at the hands of a fellow black man. I became a cop because black lives in my community, along with ALL lives, mattered to me, and wanted to help stop the bloodshed. As time went by in my law enforcement career, I quickly began to realize something. I remember the countless times I stood 2 inches from a young black man, around my age, laying on his back, gasping for air as blood filled his lungs. I remember them bleeding profusely with the unforgettable smell of deoxygenated dark red blood in the air, as it leaked from the bullet holes in his body on to the hot sidewalk on a summer day. I remember the countless family members who attacked me, spit on me, cursed me out, as I put up crime scene tape to cordon off the crime scene, yelling and screaming out of pain and anger at the sight of their loved ones taking their last breath. I never took it personally, I knew they were hurting. I remember the countless times I had to order new uniforms, because the ones I had on, were bloody from the blood of another black victim…of black on black crime. I remember the countless times I got back in my patrol car, distraught after having watched another black male die in front me, having to start my preliminary report something like this: Suspect- Black/ Male, Victim-Black /Male. I remember the countless times I canvassed the area afterwards, and asked everyone “did you see who did it”, and the popular response from the very same family members was always, “damn the Police, I ain't no snitch, Im gonna take care of this myself"". This happened every single time, every single homicide, black on black, and then my realization became clearer. I woke up every morning, put my freshly pressed uniform on, shined my badge, functioned checked my weapon, kissed my wife and kid, and waited for my wife to say the same thing she always does before I leave, “Make sure you come back home to us”. I always replied, “I will”, but the truth was I was never sure if I would. I almost lost my life on this job, and every call, every stop, every moment that I had this uniform on, was another possibility for me to almost lose my life again. I was a target in the very community I swore to protect, the very community I wanted to help. As a matter of fact, they hated my very presence. They called me “Uncle Tom”, and “wanna be white boy”, and I couldn’t understand why. My own fellow black men and women attacking me, wishing for my death, wishing for the death of my family. I was so confused, so torn, I couldn’t understand why my own black people would turn against me, when every time they called …I was there. Every time someone died….I was there. Every time they were going through one of the worst moments in their lives…I was there. So why was I the enemy? I dove deep into that question…Why was I the enemy? Then my realization became clearer. I spoke to members of the community and listened to some of the complaints as to why they hated cops. I then did research on the facts. I also presented facts to these members of the community, and listened to their complaints in response. This is what I learned: Complaint: Police always targeting us, they always messing with the black man. Fact: A city where the majority of citizens are black (Baltimore for example) …will ALWAYS have a higher rate of black people getting arrested, it will ALWAYS have a higher rate of blacks getting stopped, and will ALWAYS have a higher rate of blacks getting killed, and the reason why is because a city with those characteristics will ALWAYS have a higher rate of blacks committing crime. The statistics will follow the same trend for Asians if you go to China, for Hispanics if you go to Puerto Rico, for whites if you go to Russia, and the list goes on. It’s called Demographics Complaint: More black people get arrested than white boys. Fact: Black People commit a grossly disproportionate amount of crime. Data from the FBI shows that Nationwide, Blacks committed 5,173 homicides in 2014, whites committed 4,367. Chicago’s death toll is almost equal to that of both wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, combined. Chicago’s death toll from 2001–November, 26 2015 stands at 7,401. The combined total deaths during Operation Iraqi Freedom (2003-2015: 4,815) and Operation Enduring Freedom/Afghanistan (2001-2015: 3,506), total 8,321. Complaint: Blacks are the only ones getting killed by police, or they are killed more. Fact: As of July 2016, the breakdown of the number of US Citizens killed by Police this year is, 238 White people killed, 123 Black people killed, 79 Hispanics, 69 other/or unknown race. Fact: Black people kill more other blacks than Police do, and there are only protest and outrage when a cop kills a black man. University of Toledo criminologist Dr. Richard R. Johnson examined the latest crime data from the FBI’s Supplementary Homicide Reports and Centers for Disease Control and found that an average of 4,472 black men were killed by other black men annually between Jan. 1, 2009, and Dec. 31, 2012. Professor Johnson’s research further concluded that 112 black men died from both justified and unjustified police-involved killings annually during this same period. Complaint: Well we already doing a good job of killing ourselves, we don’t need the Police to do it. Besides they should know better. The more I listened, the more I realized. The more I researched, the more I realized. I would ask questions, and would only get emotional responses & inferences based on no facts at all. The more killing I saw, the more tragedy, the more savagery, the more violence, the more loss of life of a black man at the hands of another black man….the more I realized. I haven’t slept well in the past few nights. Heartbreak weighs me down, rage flows through my veins, and tears fills my eyes. I watched my fellow officers assassinated on live television, and the images of them laying on the ground are seared into my brain forever. I couldn’t help but wonder if it had been me, a black man, a black cop, on TV, assassinated, laying on the ground dead,..would my friends and family still think black lives mattered? Would my life have mattered? Would they make t-shirts in remembrance of me? Would they go on tv and protest violence? Would they even make a Facebook post, or share a post in reference to my death? All of my realizations came to this conclusion. Black Lives do not matter to most black people. Only the lives that make the national news matter to them. Only the lives that are taken at the hands of cops or white people, matter. The other thousands of lives lost, the other black souls that I along with every cop, have seen taken at the hands of other blacks, do not matter. Their deaths are unnoticed, accepted as the “norm”, and swept underneath the rug by the very people who claim and post “black lives matter”. I realized that this country is full of ignorance, where an educated individual will watch the ratings-driven news media, and watch a couple YouTube video clips, and then come to the conclusion that they have all the knowledge they need to have in order to know what it feels like to have a bullet proof vest as part of your office equipment, “Stay Alive” as part of your daily to do list, and having insurance for your health insurance because of the high rate of death in your profession. They watch a couple videos and then they magically know in 2 minutes 35 seconds, how you are supposed to handle a violent encounter, which took you 6 months of Academy training, 2 – 3 months of field training, and countless years of blood, sweat, tears and broken bones experiencing violent encounters and fine tuning your execution of the Use of Force Continuum. I realized that there are even cops, COPS, duly sworn law enforcement officers, who are supposed to be decent investigators, who will publicly go on the media and call other white cops racist and KKK, based on a video clip that they watched thousands of miles away, which was filmed after the fact, based on a case where the details aren’t even known yet and the investigation hasn’t even begun. I realized that most in the African American community refuse to look at solving the bigger problem that I see and deal with every day, which is black on black crime taking hundreds of innocent black lives each year, and instead focus on the 9 questionable deaths of black men, where some were in the act of committing crimes. I realized that they value the life of a Sex Offender and Convicted Felon, [who was in the act of committing multiple felonies: felon in possession of a firearm-FELONY, brandishing and threatening a homeless man with a gun-Aggravated Assault in Florida: FELONY, who resisted officers who first tried to taze him, and WAS NOT RESTRAINED, who can be clearly seen in one of the videos raising his right shoulder, then shooting it down towards the right side of his body exactly where the firearm was located and recovered] more than the lives of the innocent cops who were assassinated in Dallas protecting the very people that hated them the most. I realized that they refuse to believe that most cops acknowledge that there are Bad cops who should have never been given a badge & gun, who are chicken crap and will shoot a cockroach if it crawls at them too fast, who never worked in the hood and may be intimidated. That most cops dread the thought of having to shoot someone, and never see the turmoil and mental anguish that a cop goes through after having to kill someone to save his own life. Instead they believe that we are all blood thirsty killers, because the media says so, even though the numbers prove otherwise. I realize that they truly feel as if the death of cops will help people realize the false narrative that Black Lives Matter, when all it will do is take their movement two steps backwards and label them domestic terrorist. I realized that some of these people, who say Black Lives Matter, are full of hate and racism. Hate for cops, because of the false narrative that more black people are targeted and killed. Racism against white people, for a tragedy that began 100’s of years ago, when most of the white people today weren’t even born yet. I realized that some in the African American community’s idea of “Justice” is the prosecution of ANY and EVERY cop or white man that kills or is believed to have killed a black man, no matter what the circumstances are. I realized the African American community refuses to look within to solve its major issues, and instead makes excuses and looks outside for solutions. I realized that a lot of people in the African American community lead with hate, instead of love. Division instead of Unity. Turmoil and rioting, instead of Peace. I realized that they have become the very entity that they claim they are fighting against. I realized that the very reasons I became a cop, are the very reasons my own people hate me, and now in this toxic hateful racially charged political climate, I am now more likely to die,... and it is still hard for me to understand…. to this day.   Art  It is not much different here in Canada Art. Almost all of the shootings are non white shooting non white (I'm being polite). I'm not sure why it seems that way, perhaps whites are now the visible minority.  As long as we have organizations like BLM claiming discrimination there will be no solutions."
976229,fishing n autograph,2016-07-11 22:00:00,2540,"^^^ it's going to be much worse in Ontario because of the recent changes. The provincial government was told you are only going to harm the community you're trying to help by making the changes because the violence won't be happening in the Bridlepath or Forest Hill. They are going to effect Jane/finch, rexdale and malvern etc.  20-4o years ago police were told ""get out of your car and interact with the community."" They did, they cleaned up some neighbourhoods. Because criminals didn't like that and the social justice warriors said this isn't fair and its racial profiling so they said ""get back into your car and leave us alone. We will call you if we need you.""  So many public figures like Sheriff Clarke in Wisconsin and the officer that posted that quote, the people that Black lives matter to the most are the police because we are the ones keeping them from harming each other. If police weren't in the bad neighbourhoods all the young males and innocent people would be gunned down."
976244,SirCranksalot,2016-07-12 00:25:00,3291,"Now I am going to chime in on your ridiculous comments JoePa.  I, for one, don't think JP's comments are ridiculous at all. I know there are good cops, but there are more than a fair share of arrogant dicks who think they are above the law. Keep treating citizens that way and sooner or later someone will pay---maybe not the right cop and maybe totally and violently off the scale.  I've seen lots of 'minor' cases of cops thinking they are above the law---tailgating a driver going the speed limit, creating a traffic hazard by sticking the rear end of their parked car when dealing with some issue on the side of the road. I was nearly T-boned by a cop car gunning it thru an amber light. I know these are fairly small things but it shown an attitude, IMO  I commend JP and any others for standing up for their rights, be they American, Canadian or whatever. Respect is a 2-way street.

The only point I have issue with in the last post was the one about the officer creating a traffic hazard by putting the rear end of his car out into traffic. The reason they are taught to do this is because of all the officers, emergency responders and tow truck operators who have been killed by some idiot who would not move over and sped past the situation clipping the said emergency personnel. They now leave the vehicle back some distance and offset to protect themselves and the people in the vehicle they have pulled over. I personally know of one such case where the responder was hit and flew through the air approx. 200' before coming to rest splattered on the back doors of a parked cube van ......"
976283,John,2016-07-12 13:20:00,2956,"Everyone deserves their day in court. IF you want that day then make it possible to be arrested. Once you escalate it then the police escalate until you have made the decision to stop. At any time after he started his crime he could have thrown down his weapon and laid face down on the concrete and he wold be alive. Even after taking 5 lives he would still be alive. Once he disobeyed the command of lay down your weapon and as long as he did he did not want justice he wanted to kill. Some say wait him out? Why give him a chance to escape justice, kill more people, make bigger headlines??? Does anyone think that SWAT like killing? Does the sniper have to live with this on his conscious/ soul for the rest of his life? Have any of you ever talked to someone who has killed a person in there job defending innocents? Talk to a veteran about his tour if he did kill someone it will be a story that will be difficult at best and for some impossible to tell you about. Many of the comments here are made from people who think they know or can imagine what it was like in the violence we have in the world but while they have a logical thought it fails to take in real life factors. ""Just get rid of all handguns"" ,""Fire all of the bad cops"" these are simple logical thoughts that have no path in today's society to accomplish. We might as well say ""make all handguns rust into dust"" or ""make all of the bad people stop being bad"". I have found arguing with an armchair wizard is a waste of time. A discussion with a person who has lived or done and has common grounds is a chance to move ahead and improve a situation.  Art  Absolutely right Art.."
976285,AKRISONER,2016-07-12 13:47:00,5558,"a good statement, but what it doesnt touch on is the fact that white people forced black people into ""cages"" where lack of hope runs deep.  You bet that baltimore is full of crime, and you can bet that black people are involved in a dispraportionate amount of crime...why? cause thats where these people are born and raised, their grandparents were forced into the ghetto with no jobs and no opportunities. As biggie smalls says ""you either selling crack rock or you got a wicked jump shot""  Its easy for us to sit back and say ""black people should get their asses up and get jobs"" how about if there are no jobs available, how about if your parents are unemployed addicted to crack (funded by Ronald Regan and the contras) Do you honestly stand a great chance? you cant put yourselves in these peoples shoes. The cycle is deep as can be, and I dont personally have the answers on how to solve it.  Its hard to say that a kid with a dad in jail and his mom working 4 crappy jobs is gonna work at mcdonalds for minimum wage when there is easier money to be made in the streets. Thats the reality of the urban ghetto."

976310,JoePa,2016-07-12 16:20:00,179,There is a solution but you can't talk about it because you will be called a racist - the problem in the big cities is that the black culture does not provide the support of a strong family - the basic foundation of a society - when you read that 73% of black children are born to single mothers you feel sorry for the kids as they grow up without the support of a good father - the kids end up in the streets with other kids in a similar situation and join gangs for support - until this situation is resolved things will never get any better -  How is a kid who grows up in such an environment going to compete with kids who have a mother and father who take good care of them and make such their kids do well in school and get a good education or trade - so what happens - they end up in welfare the rest of their lives and past this situation on to their children - an never ending cycle -  I was born in a coal mining town in northeast Pa. - most of my neighbors were coal miners - one thing we had in common - we were all poor - but you know something - we had good families for support and faith to count on - I had 2 uncles who were killed in the mines in 2 separate accidents - both left several young children and a widow to fend for themselves - everyone of those kids grew up to be good citizens

The issue is far far more complex than laziness or being ""inherently bad""  Sorry you hit a nerve I will stop now but you need to listen less to the news and talk and spend time with the black people you are championing for. I have seen and spent time with both law enforcement and the people who live in the projects. Actually Watergate was in 1972 and had nothing to do with the Contra scandal in 1986. The US was funding a revolution and it hardly caused the black people to be oppressed or long term drug trafficking that exists 30 years later. Your views of how black people are existing in the US is very distorted and the verbiage of Cages is a way to paint a picture that is just silly. Last time I checked taking drugs was voluntary every one has a choice if you decide to choose the wrong path then you reap what you have sown. Choosing a path to join a gang to be safe might work for a short time however how often is gang on gang killing the result. I have a friend who arrived in the US with 10 dollars in his pocket from Israel and the cloths on his back. He now runs a remodeling company. We are talking about a man who had a price on his head for helping a US soldier and to boot he spoke no english. He over came his obstacles in life and so can MOST people. There is no easy solution and to many people think there is. Here is a revelation drum roll ................you got to work for it.......... Why does your buddy have a bigger boat than you? he earned it. Why does he have more money because he saved and earned it(excluding old money). Talk to anyone who has made a million the hard way and they will tell you work hard sacrifice and save. Once you got money working for you instead of  working for money then you can relax not when your 20 or 30 or even older. This crap about we need to redistribute wealth and support the poor holds no water with me.

976350,AKRISONER,2016-07-12 20:32:00,5558,"ya and president obama is an african american...of course there are people who overcome, but not everyone is going to be a super star, nor have the intelligence to start a succesful business etc.  My father grew up on a farm with no money, joined the military to put himself through school and is now a very successful businessman. So i know exactly what it means to do ""it the hard way"" but expecting everyone to have that kind of drive, intelligence, and work ethic is a bit far fetched. God I know i dont have the same drive that he has, nor will i ever make a 10th of what he does.  The crack epidemic was inadvertently funded by the US government.This shouldnt come as a surprise as they more recently funded the taliban as well. Theres definitive proof that the CIA was funding the contras and then cut funding which caused them to turn even more heavily to the production and distribution of cocaine for funding. You can then move onto all sorts of theories about CIA operatives assisting with the distribution of the stuff...which in some regards is a bit crazy, but in another point to say that the police, DEA and government in miami in the 80's was a group of straight shooters is a total stretch.  Perhaps its difficult for you to understand the term ""cages"" but anyone who has an affiliation for hip-hop culture and music understands the reference. The cages refer to the projects in every major metropolis in the United States that are full of African American's whos grandparents were forced to live in such areas.  In some ways it seems like you think the issue with African American's, crime, the incarceration rate and every other social issue facing them is due to laziness?  The nice thing is that at least in todays society, for the most part there are more avenues available to african americans, however to deny white priviledge is wrong.  This is all happening in a country where its totally socially acceptable to proudly fly the confederate flag..."

I can not find common ground or feel it is important to change your mind with facts that have not been slanted. I live here and I get news and information that differs from what you get. I am from the South and have older family members that have lived and worked alongside black people in the mid to early 1900's. I was raised in the 60's alongside military and civilian people of all nations what I saw and learned is vastly different that what you are saying. Perhaps I have been lied too or shielded from the truth but that is more unlikely than what you believe what is going on on this side of the Border. At no point did I say laziness nor inferred it. I said taking the easy road or path of least resistance. Percentage wise you will find white,black green or blue all have an equal chance to hold a job. In fact minorities have a better chance due to quotas and HR policies but yes 20 white people apply to be CEO while fewer black people even percentage wise will apply for the same position. I can state that we have almost 90% non blacks as plumbers. Not because we won't hire them but few want to put in the time and hard work to become a master plumber.

I believe everything that's been going on has to do with a persons choices and their behaviour. You don't have the right to resist arrest you don't need to go around breaking the law and you don't point a firearm at a cop and expect anything but to be shot.

Just listening to Jim Richards on 1010 and it was said by an expert this afternoon that most all major cities in Ontario have explosives available for them to do just what the Police did in Dallas. Here is our negotiator, it's a pound of C-4 on a Robo Cop.  I listened to an interview today of the murderers parents. I have empathy for them as well. They lost a son and will have to live the rest of their lives knowing what that piece of excrement did."

Obviously the use of explosives was questionable and the powers that be have to answer to their actions.  And in terms of the explosives they wouldn't be used that way in Canada. They are very small charges used to breach doors and set off larger explosives (IEDs and suspicious packages)  But I think the choice was to end it before more people were hurt.

At that point theres no point is putting further police lives in jeapordy, the guy was already miraculously alive after the initial firefight. The police had already attempted to use deadly force but the bugger survived. No harm no foul IMO"
976195,manitoubass2,2016-07-11 19:12:00,11391,Please tell me how a stun grenade or something similar to disable the suspect wouldnt work?
976196,fishing n autograph,2016-07-11 19:16:00,2540,Can't get close enough to even throw it.  He was a trained shooter and even the U.S. Reservists are trained to fight the effects of gas and flash bangs  The robot probably delivered the phone to the shooter and was already there watching him.
976197,AKRISONER,2016-07-11 19:21:00,5558,"Please tell me how a stun grenade or something similar to disable the suspect wouldnt work?  sorry...how does stun grenading him and then shooting him change the scenario? The only change is that now you are relying on a swat team member to shoot the guy with the potential risk of the cultprit wearing a suicide vest or potentially getting a shot off at the cops. (he was a trained military man)  Correct me if I am wrong, but is there any way to incapacitate someone in an open environment aside from a direct blow to their head?"
976198,manitoubass2,2016-07-11 19:21:00,11391,"Good reminder! If a robot ever delivers me a phone, dont pick ut up lol  Good points though.  Just glad im not the one that makes that call"
976199,Sinker,2016-07-11 19:24:00,8692,"A guy like that you use any force needed. Run him down with a car if you have to. He is standing there shooting at innocent people. He doesn't get a freakin trial. Kill the dude....like now. BOOM!  Man, the bleeding hearts are so thick these days. Stuff like this gets me very irritated.  S."
976200,manitoubass2,2016-07-11 19:25:00,11391,Same thing swat does here.  In our district weve had at least 5 standoffs in the last 10 years or so.  They simply wait you out.  Stand in a spot for 3 or 4 days without being able to move much and eventually they all (at least here) give up on their own
976202,Sinker,2016-07-11 19:27:00,8692,"It baffles me how you guys think this guy deserves anything but death. He just killed 5 cops, and wounded however many more.......take him out, yesterday!   S."
976203,fishing n autograph,2016-07-11 19:29:00,2540,The phone didn't blow him up. Most of the robots have a single arm that looks like a jackhammer that carries an explosive charge in the end. My guess is that the drove the robot up to him and did a contact shot because it's not a powerful explosion
976204,Big Cliff,2016-07-11 19:30:00,6899,No but reaching or a firearm escalated both situation.  I believe everything that's been going on has to do with a persons choices and their behaviour. You don't have the right to resist arrest you don't need to go around breaking the law and you don't point a firearm at a cop and expect anything but to be shot. 10 4 on that one!
976207,manitoubass2,2016-07-11 19:48:00,11391,"Oh I certainly believe he deserves death. But thats not really how law works.  Heaven forbid you make a mistake one day and hit a cop car and kill him or an innocent family.  Because you deserve that same fate, as would I."
976208,Big Cliff,2016-07-11 19:52:00,6899,"It baffles me how you guys think this guy deserves anything but death. He just killed 5 cops, and wounded however many more.......take him out, yesterday!   S. Doesn't matter if he killed one cop or one innocent person I totally agree take him out and save the tax payers a ton of money! Actually all they need to do is change the laws: Get caught carrying a gun without proper authorization 10 years, discharge an illegal fire arm; 20 years, kill someone with or without intent, Life! Second offence X3. No iff's ands or buts about it! Most of the people doing this sort of thing are career criminals that have been in and out of jail most of their lives.  Now when it comes to cop brutality; there are a few bad apples out there sure but in 70 years I have never had a cop pull his gun on me, I have never been beaten into the ground, (or beaten at all for that matter) I have never had reason to fear for my life or safety.  In fact just the opposite and in fact when I lived in French River I and my brother-in-laws stood sholder to sholder with a lone OPP officer, his name was Rod Mc xxxxxxx (won't post it openly) that was facing down 6 drunks looking to do him harm in the parking lot of the Champlain Hotel. He never did draw his side arm even prior to us stepping in. Perhaps things were just different then, people settled their differances with a fist fight then sat down and had a beer together."
976209,Sinker,2016-07-11 19:54:00,8692,"That's apples to oranges, bud.  A dude intentionally shooting innocent people deserves death and nothing less. A car accident is totally different.  And the way the law works doesn't matter either when a guy is killing people. Do you think he cares about a fair trial?  I wish I could go back in time, because the way things are nowadays is a disgrace. The human race is so watered down, we are nothing but a parasite on the earth. Its sad!  S."
976210,Sinker,2016-07-11 19:58:00,8692,"I knew you would agree, Cliff.  The justice system is a whole different JOKE. Like I said earlier, too many bleeding hearts. Oh, that poor murderer, what about his rights? Screw that CRAP. Bang, done. Simple.  I better bite my tongue now or I might hurt someones feelings. Gimme a break!!  S."

976216,aplumma,2016-07-11 20:26:00,6896,"Everyone deserves their day in court. IF you want that day then make it possible to be arrested. Once you escalate it then the police escalate until you have made the decision to stop. At any time after he started his crime he could have thrown down his weapon and laid face down on the concrete and he wold be alive. Even after taking 5 lives he would still be alive. Once he disobeyed the command of lay down your weapon and as long as he did he did not want justice he wanted to kill. Some say wait him out? Why give him a chance to escape justice, kill more people, make bigger headlines??? Does anyone think that SWAT like killing? Does the sniper have to live with this on his conscious/ soul for the rest of his life? Have any of you ever talked to someone who has killed a person in there job defending innocents? Talk to a veteran about his tour if he did kill someone it will be a story that will be difficult at best and for some impossible to tell you about. Many of the comments here are made from people who think they know or can imagine what it was like in the violence we have in the world but while they have a logical thought it fails to take in real life factors. ""Just get rid of all handguns"" ,""Fire all of the bad cops"" these are simple logical thoughts that have no path in today's society to accomplish. We might as well say ""make all handguns rust into dust"" or ""make all of the bad people stop being bad"". I have found arguing with an armchair wizard is a waste of time. A discussion with a person who has lived or done and has common grounds is a chance to move ahead and improve a situation.  Art"
976222,Old Ironmaker,2016-07-11 21:33:00,8243,"The Dallas Police Chief said today that if the same circumstances were faced tomorrow he would make the same decision to blow the guy to Kingdome Come. The perpetrator was in a position that would put his people in harms way to get a shot off. The guy made it absolutely clear he wasn't about to surrender before he killed more Police. He told them he had bombs planted in many locations in Dallas set to go off. That's what surprised me when I heard the blast on CNN during the stand off in the wee morning hours. If he indeed had bombs planted killing him before they could get that info from him could be tragic. It was clear to Police he was toying with them for the 2 hour stand off. I don't think he saw that coming. A pound of C-4 was used, I don't know if that's a lot, it sure sounds like it. I support the Chiefs decision 100%. He is impressive to say the least.  Kill innocent people and threaten to kill more and you aren't living to tell about it. Even a nut bar may think twice about it."
976223,aplumma,2016-07-11 21:46:00,6896,"I was sent this and it is well worth the time reading it.  Thank you Officer Jay Stalien  Author of the cut and paste below. I have come to realize something that is still hard for me to understand to this day. The following may be a shock to some coming from an African American, but the mere fact that it may be shocking to some is prima facie evidence of the sad state of affairs that we are in as Humans. I used to be so torn inside growing up. Here I am, a young African-American born and raised in Brooklyn, NY wanting to be a cop. I watched and lived through the crime that took place in the hood. My own black people killing others over nothing. Crack heads and heroin addicts lined the lobby of my building as I shuffled around them to make my way to our 1 bedroom apartment with 6 of us living inside. I used to be woken up in the middle of the night by the sound of gun fire, only to look outside and see that it was 2 African Americans shooting at each other. It never sat right with me. I wanted to help my community and stop watching the blood of African Americans spilled on the street at the hands of a fellow black man. I became a cop because black lives in my community, along with ALL lives, mattered to me, and wanted to help stop the bloodshed. As time went by in my law enforcement career, I quickly began to realize something. I remember the countless times I stood 2 inches from a young black man, around my age, laying on his back, gasping for air as blood filled his lungs. I remember them bleeding profusely with the unforgettable smell of deoxygenated dark red blood in the air, as it leaked from the bullet holes in his body on to the hot sidewalk on a summer day. I remember the countless family members who attacked me, spit on me, cursed me out, as I put up crime scene tape to cordon off the crime scene, yelling and screaming out of pain and anger at the sight of their loved ones taking their last breath. I never took it personally, I knew they were hurting. I remember the countless times I had to order new uniforms, because the ones I had on, were bloody from the blood of another black victim…of black on black crime. I remember the countless times I got back in my patrol car, distraught after having watched another black male die in front me, having to start my preliminary report something like this: Suspect- Black/ Male, Victim-Black /Male. I remember the countless times I canvassed the area afterwards, and asked everyone “did you see who did it”, and the popular response from the very same family members was always, “damn the Police, I ain't no snitch, Im gonna take care of this myself"". This happened every single time, every single homicide, black on black, and then my realization became clearer. I woke up every morning, put my freshly pressed uniform on, shined my badge, functioned checked my weapon, kissed my wife and kid, and waited for my wife to say the same thing she always does before I leave, “Make sure you come back home to us”. I always replied, “I will”, but the truth was I was never sure if I would. I almost lost my life on this job, and every call, every stop, every moment that I had this uniform on, was another possibility for me to almost lose my life again. I was a target in the very community I swore to protect, the very community I wanted to help. As a matter of fact, they hated my very presence. They called me “Uncle Tom”, and “wanna be white boy”, and I couldn’t understand why. My own fellow black men and women attacking me, wishing for my death, wishing for the death of my family. I was so confused, so torn, I couldn’t understand why my own black people would turn against me, when every time they called …I was there. Every time someone died….I was there. Every time they were going through one of the worst moments in their lives…I was there. So why was I the enemy? I dove deep into that question…Why was I the enemy? Then my realization became clearer. I spoke to members of the community and listened to some of the complaints as to why they hated cops. I then did research on the facts. I also presented facts to these members of the community, and listened to their complaints in response. This is what I learned: Complaint: Police always targeting us, they always messing with the black man. Fact: A city where the majority of citizens are black (Baltimore for example) …will ALWAYS have a higher rate of black people getting arrested, it will ALWAYS have a higher rate of blacks getting stopped, and will ALWAYS have a higher rate of blacks getting killed, and the reason why is because a city with those characteristics will ALWAYS have a higher rate of blacks committing crime. The statistics will follow the same trend for Asians if you go to China, for Hispanics if you go to Puerto Rico, for whites if you go to Russia, and the list goes on. It’s called Demographics Complaint: More black people get arrested than white boys. Fact: Black People commit a grossly disproportionate amount of crime. Data from the FBI shows that Nationwide, Blacks committed 5,173 homicides in 2014, whites committed 4,367. Chicago’s death toll is almost equal to that of both wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, combined. Chicago’s death toll from 2001–November, 26 2015 stands at 7,401. The combined total deaths during Operation Iraqi Freedom (2003-2015: 4,815) and Operation Enduring Freedom/Afghanistan (2001-2015: 3,506), total 8,321. Complaint: Blacks are the only ones getting killed by police, or they are killed more. Fact: As of July 2016, the breakdown of the number of US Citizens killed by Police this year is, 238 White people killed, 123 Black people killed, 79 Hispanics, 69 other/or unknown race. Fact: Black people kill more other blacks than Police do, and there are only protest and outrage when a cop kills a black man. University of Toledo criminologist Dr. Richard R. Johnson examined the latest crime data from the FBI’s Supplementary Homicide Reports and Centers for Disease Control and found that an average of 4,472 black men were killed by other black men annually between Jan. 1, 2009, and Dec. 31, 2012. Professor Johnson’s research further concluded that 112 black men died from both justified and unjustified police-involved killings annually during this same period. Complaint: Well we already doing a good job of killing ourselves, we don’t need the Police to do it. Besides they should know better. The more I listened, the more I realized. The more I researched, the more I realized. I would ask questions, and would only get emotional responses & inferences based on no facts at all. The more killing I saw, the more tragedy, the more savagery, the more violence, the more loss of life of a black man at the hands of another black man….the more I realized. I haven’t slept well in the past few nights. Heartbreak weighs me down, rage flows through my veins, and tears fills my eyes. I watched my fellow officers assassinated on live television, and the images of them laying on the ground are seared into my brain forever. I couldn’t help but wonder if it had been me, a black man, a black cop, on TV, assassinated, laying on the ground dead,..would my friends and family still think black lives mattered? Would my life have mattered? Would they make t-shirts in remembrance of me? Would they go on tv and protest violence? Would they even make a Facebook post, or share a post in reference to my death? All of my realizations came to this conclusion. Black Lives do not matter to most black people. Only the lives that make the national news matter to them. Only the lives that are taken at the hands of cops or white people, matter. The other thousands of lives lost, the other black souls that I along with every cop, have seen taken at the hands of other blacks, do not matter. Their deaths are unnoticed, accepted as the “norm”, and swept underneath the rug by the very people who claim and post “black lives matter”. I realized that this country is full of ignorance, where an educated individual will watch the ratings-driven news media, and watch a couple YouTube video clips, and then come to the conclusion that they have all the knowledge they need to have in order to know what it feels like to have a bullet proof vest as part of your office equipment, “Stay Alive” as part of your daily to do list, and having insurance for your health insurance because of the high rate of death in your profession. They watch a couple videos and then they magically know in 2 minutes 35 seconds, how you are supposed to handle a violent encounter, which took you 6 months of Academy training, 2 – 3 months of field training, and countless years of blood, sweat, tears and broken bones experiencing violent encounters and fine tuning your execution of the Use of Force Continuum. I realized that there are even cops, COPS, duly sworn law enforcement officers, who are supposed to be decent investigators, who will publicly go on the media and call other white cops racist and KKK, based on a video clip that they watched thousands of miles away, which was filmed after the fact, based on a case where the details aren’t even known yet and the investigation hasn’t even begun. I realized that most in the African American community refuse to look at solving the bigger problem that I see and deal with every day, which is black on black crime taking hundreds of innocent black lives each year, and instead focus on the 9 questionable deaths of black men, where some were in the act of committing crimes. I realized that they value the life of a Sex Offender and Convicted Felon, [who was in the act of committing multiple felonies: felon in possession of a firearm-FELONY, brandishing and threatening a homeless man with a gun-Aggravated Assault in Florida: FELONY, who resisted officers who first tried to taze him, and WAS NOT RESTRAINED, who can be clearly seen in one of the videos raising his right shoulder, then shooting it down towards the right side of his body exactly where the firearm was located and recovered] more than the lives of the innocent cops who were assassinated in Dallas protecting the very people that hated them the most. I realized that they refuse to believe that most cops acknowledge that there are Bad cops who should have never been given a badge & gun, who are chicken crap and will shoot a cockroach if it crawls at them too fast, who never worked in the hood and may be intimidated. That most cops dread the thought of having to shoot someone, and never see the turmoil and mental anguish that a cop goes through after having to kill someone to save his own life. Instead they believe that we are all blood thirsty killers, because the media says so, even though the numbers prove otherwise. I realize that they truly feel as if the death of cops will help people realize the false narrative that Black Lives Matter, when all it will do is take their movement two steps backwards and label them domestic terrorist. I realized that some of these people, who say Black Lives Matter, are full of hate and racism. Hate for cops, because of the false narrative that more black people are targeted and killed. Racism against white people, for a tragedy that began 100’s of years ago, when most of the white people today weren’t even born yet. I realized that some in the African American community’s idea of “Justice” is the prosecution of ANY and EVERY cop or white man that kills or is believed to have killed a black man, no matter what the circumstances are. I realized the African American community refuses to look within to solve its major issues, and instead makes excuses and looks outside for solutions. I realized that a lot of people in the African American community lead with hate, instead of love. Division instead of Unity. Turmoil and rioting, instead of Peace. I realized that they have become the very entity that they claim they are fighting against. I realized that the very reasons I became a cop, are the very reasons my own people hate me, and now in this toxic hateful racially charged political climate, I am now more likely to die,... and it is still hard for me to understand…. to this day.

976100,John,2016-07-10 18:51:00,2956,"Sorry Sinker - it's not my attitude - these mass killings happen because cops have for years mistreated citizens - if cops respect each citizen's rights then there would not be any of these type killings - if I have the right to remain silent - then why doesn't the cop respect that and give me a ticket if I broke some traffic law and let it go at that - its when the cop starts pushing his weight around beyond the law that makes things go south -  Even respectable former judges are now advocating that citizens record any encounter they have with police - people just don't start mistrusting cops because they have nothing better to do - there is a reason for it - people are sick and tired of cops acting like storm troopers -  I have a GoPro camera attached to my dash - if I get pulled over I would turn the camera so that it faces the driver's side window - you would be surprised how cops change their attitude once they see that they are being recorded - I'll tell you one thing - they hate being filmed - but then if they are doing nothing wrong why  should they care - after all their dash cam is recording me -  I'm sorry too JoePa it's 100% your attitude. Mass killings happen for many reasons least of all due to police action. Citizens of any country need to respect one another, regardless of their profession or status in life. Attitude is everything regardless of the offence or perceived offence. The situation is going to change quickly once the officer has suspicion that you are hiding or attempting to hide something. Unfortunately if and when you give police reason to suspect you have committed an offence, YOUR attitude will determine the outcome!"
976102,Sinker,2016-07-10 19:15:00,8692,"I was always taught by my grandfather, and father that respect is earned. If you treat people with no respect, guess how they are going to treat you? I find a lot of people south of the border just have this screw you , I have my rights, kiss my butt attitude that really stinks. Its not hard to be a decent person to EVERYONE.  I guarantee I would never have an issue with any cops anywhere, unless I was being a dick to them, or if I had done something horribly wrong. To get yanked out of my car for being pulled over goes both ways. The victim was being a dick, which put the cops on edge.  Are there bad cops, oh hell yeah there are. Are there bad people? More than ever. Treat people with  just a little respect goes a long ways.  I'm sick of this me, mine attitude everywhere with everyone. I come from a small town in the middle of nowhere. If it weren't for the people in our community, we never would have made it where we are today. Respect is the key.  S."
976105,Old Ironmaker,2016-07-10 19:28:00,8243,"I have met good cops and not so good ones. I have never been so nice as when I have occasion to be questioned by Police. The worse have been in the US, maybe because of the Ontario plates. I'll say it again, I do know that many cops down there should not be cops from day 1, some are simply not qualified, actually I bet it's many. I had a neighbour in Florida that was a cop, he was piss drunk on the job half the time. I know that for a fact."
976114,JoePa,2016-07-10 20:30:00,179,Maybe some of you don't value freedom to the extent we do down here - as an American I have certain rights that I cherish - and I know if we keep giving them up they won't be around very long - the guy who just goes along with the Cop's instructions because it is the easy and safest way is not doing anyone a favor - I admire the guy who stands up for his rights - we need more people like that - if your a cop and you for some reason can't respect the rights of an individual then you shouldn't be a cop - get another job - like maybe flipping burgers -  Time and time again you see on video where cops overstep their boundary when dealing with people - and the main reason is that they have developed a culture within their ranks that they are in a position where they can do what they want - well things are changing with people filming them and they are going to have to get their act together or you will see more shootings like Dallas -  In the last two cases where cops shot two black guys - what do you think would have happened if these instances were not recorded - nothing - the cops would have lied and the whole matter brushed under the rug  When you watch what happened in the one case where the cop shot the guy in the car - the cops all point their guns at the woman and make her kneel on the ground and then handcuff her - then put her in the police car - while this is happening the guy that was shot is bleeding to death - how the hell is this unarmed woman any danger to these cops - they should have been treating the dying guy - if they are so threatened by an unarmed woman then they shouldn't be cops  We had an incident a week or so ago in a town not too far from where I live - a couple put their turn signals on and pulled their car over to the side of a street in front of their house - a cop pulls up and wants to ticket them for not putting on their turn signal - they don't agree with what the cop is saying - the woman uses her cellphone to record what is going on - the cop tries to take the phone away from the woman - she won't give it up so he knocks her down on the porch steps - punches her a couple times and takes the phone and smashes it against the side walk -  He then grabs the woman and throws her down on the sidewalk and puts the cuffs on her - well unknown to the cop there is a video camera on one of the porches which is recording the event - it also shows that the couple did indeed put their turn signal on when they parked - well I'll tell you something - if I was the husband of that woman that cop would be in the hospital - the cop was fired and arrested - thanks to the camera -

I value my rights as much as you do yours, to say I don't just exemplifies your typical American attitude. We Canadians lost more citizens per capita then did Americans in both world wars.

""You can't talk to me like that I'M AMuRICUN"". Big freakin deal Joe. Calm down Joe, the US isn't God's chosen nation no matter how much you might believe it is.

They play nice, then hell breaks loose. Im sure you know the story. This is why they act first at times. Is it right, maybe not, but like Shane said, thier lives are woth just that. Thier lives. The last thing they want to do is TURN thier back.  It plays both ways.  Not arguing your post, just looking at it from the otherside.  you mean Barrie cops like this?

976121,Steve,2016-07-10 21:34:00,2075,"Maybe some of you don't value freedom to the extent we do down here - as an American I have certain rights that I cherish - and I know if we keep giving them up they won't be around very long - the guy who just goes along with the Cop's instructions because it is the easy and safest way is not doing anyone a favor - I admire the guy who stands up for his rights - we need more people like that - if your a cop and you for some reason can't respect the rights of an individual then you shouldn't be a cop - get another job - like maybe flipping burgers -  Time and time again you see on video where cops overstep their boundary when dealing with people - and the main reason is that they have developed a culture within their ranks that they are in a position where they can do what they want - well things are changing with people filming them and they are going to have to get their act together or you will see more shootings like Dallas -  In the last two cases where cops shot two black guys - what do you think would have happened if these instances were not recorded - nothing - the cops would have lied and the whole matter brushed under the rug  When you watch what happened in the one case where the cop shot the guy in the car - the cops all point their guns at the woman and make her kneel on the ground and then handcuff her - then put her in the police car - while this is happening the guy that was shot is bleeding to death - how the hell is this unarmed woman any danger to these cops - they should have been treating the dying guy - if they are so threatened by an unarmed woman then they shouldn't be cops  We had an incident a week or so ago in a town not too far from where I live - a couple put their turn signals on and pulled their car over to the side of a street in front of their house - a cop pulls up and wants to ticket them for not putting on their turn signal - they don't agree with what the cop is saying - the woman uses her cellphone to record what is going on - the cop tries to take the phone away from the woman - she won't give it up so he knocks her down on the porch steps - punches her a couple times and takes the phone and smashes it against the side walk -  He then grabs the woman and throws her down on the sidewalk and puts the cuffs on her - well unknown to the cop there is a video camera on one of the porches which is recording the event - it also shows that the couple did indeed put their turn signal on when they parked - well I'll tell you something - if I was the husband of that woman that cop would be in the hospital - the cop was fired and arrested - thanks to the camera -    Outside of your first sentence, I agree with your post wholeheartedly. Trust me, Canadians value their freedoms equally to our American neighbours.  With respect to cameras being used everywhere....citizens once had a fear of ""big brother"". Now big brother has fear of ""little brother"" - the cameras that are used to capture what once was ""swept under the rug"". Now, with direct live streaming, any chance of destroying evidence will be removed."

If this wasn't caught on camera, he would've got off easy. and the other ""good"" Barrie cops would help cover it up or look the other way.  Cops never speak out on other cops, its against the brotherhood.   This cop is a goon. This was total b s and this we ALL know. This is the kind we dont need. Yes, without the camera, he gets away."

I value my rights as much as you do yours, to say I don't just exemplifies your typical American attitude. We Canadians lost more citizens per capita then did Americans in both world wars. We were a country of around 15 million and the US was around 150 million if I remember, just a guess. The same goes for Afghanistan.  You seem to be that ""rude"" Amuricun we all see when travelling. ""You can't talk to me like that I'M AMuRICUN"". Big freakin deal Joe. Calm down Joe, the US isn't God's chosen nation no matter how much you might believe it is.

Don't get all worked up Iron - if you read my post I started off saying some don't - not all - if you do or not I don't know but anyone who would allow a cop to take away his freedom by illegally taking away his rights can't value freedom very much -  Typical American attitude - what - you get all bent out of shape when a man stands up for his rights - what you want for us to be a bunch of wimps - no way - I wasn't raised that way - and as far as being an amuricum - I'll tell you something - I don't know my country anymore - have little in common with it  As far as leaving Pa -  let me tell you something - I'm 82 years old - a Korean combat vet - been all over the world - lived in Canada for awhile - have  MS and Bull in mechanical engineering - worked at the world's top research and development company (Bell Telephone Laboratories) - lived in a number of different states - raised 5 kids - and you know something - I stand up for my rights - if you or anyone else likes it or not - oh - I also carry a firearm with me just in case -"

Or a guy sitting in his car with a 4 year old in the back seat getting murdered for a broken tail light!  No it does not .. the first one shot was not fighting for his life he was fighting for his freedom he may have got his hands free or may have been trying to grab gun who knows .. but a piece of crap like him should never have been out of jail... and  i would say the same thing if he was white. this guy had no business being on the street and was not a nice man.if it was my daughter he had sex with when he was 20 and she was 14 i would have killed him myself. drug offences with guns ECT should have been in jail... if you understand that if he was arrested and taken to jail and they found out he never regeesterd as a sex offender and was looking at a long time in jail you can now put in the fight he was scared of playing with the big boys in jail...

The job they do is one that I've never envied. But the thought of being a police officer in the States is off the map crazy. You ask me, the inmates are running the prison. People, any people...angry people, mentally disturbed people, depressed people are allowed to walk around carrying weapons because it's their right?? LOL If you have a health issue that makes you a potential hazard to drive, they take away your drivers licence! Makes sense! That's because it's not a right, it's a privilege to operate a motor vehicle. But anyone can carry a friggin gun. And then they're all shocked when a police officer, makes a poor decision (as deemed by the masses through the benefit of slow motion camera from the safety of their livingrooms) and someone gets shot. Let me tell you, I'd be shooting too. In a given split second life or death decision, I pick ME every single time. Frankly, I'm surprised it doesn't happen more often."

Im not agreeing or disagreeing, but your not getting too many youtube views filming an officer of the law giving you a warning for speeding.  How iften have you been pulled over joe? Im assuming, maybe incorrectly, lots if you intentionally have a gopro at reach to film an interaction.  Also, remember ""probable cause"" is very loosely worded.  If im an officer approaching your vehicle and i see you shuffling to find your gopro, that might be all I need to believe your concealing something or may be in voilation of a law(s).

Your amendment rights are there so that you have recourse if you are treated badly. If your not treated badly, there is no need to use them. By acting the way you describe, it gives an officer reason to believe you have something to hide, and maybe cause him or her to investigate further.

BLM, the list is endless! You can't have it both ways! BTW (all lives matter)!  It isn't hard to find countless organizations that exclude white or non black people but at the same time try to form an organization that excludes people of color and you would have your butt handed to you and you would be tagged as racist.  I grew up beside and lived with people of almost every race and nationality, I have many friends that are ""non white"" but we don't see colors, we see hearts and charactor, we see each other as people, as friends.  Blacks need to be treated as equals, whites need to be treated as equals, until everyone starts treating the person standing next to him as equal there will always be these conflicts!  I fear however that these conflicts are only going to worsen, it isn't the average black/white/ whatever race or nationality that organize these things, I truly think that a lot of these conflicts are the work of people with other agendas.

975927,woodenboater,2016-07-08 20:15:00,2277,"this question for our friends in the US (Art et al).  So it's been reported that Philando Castile told the officer that he was carrying and had a license which he was going get out of his pocket. It's also been reported (whether this is true or not I have no idea) that gun owners who are carrying are drilled to tell LEOs that they have a gun in their possession, that they have a license for the gun and that they will show the license to give to said officer.  If LEO was wearing a camera, then it should help clear up what happened but imo, when there's a child in the car, he's a passenger AND he says he's in possession and has a license, then chances are he's not going to do harm. A gang banger would just draw and take his chances. Utterly tragic and you can see the officer instantly regretted his decision.  Regardless, this has been a brutal week for LEOs and others. The Dallas shooting is absolutely chilling in that this was planned and carried out in the space of what ? 48 hrs ?  I hope saner and cooler heads prevail and that this really isn't the start of the devolution of American society."

The class struggle and racial divide is becoming very polarising and I'm fearful that the gulf is going to become such that it will never be bridged and indeed form a greater chasm across society.  I've been to the US during certain events of historical magnitude and it was very easy to see things sliding down the abyss if events create the right conditions for something to happen. Not saying it will but imo, it won't take much for everything to go south. and quickly.  What our friends down there need are for the people to step back, cool down and use their grey matter to look at the big picture as I'm sure those who DO want to do ill will are sitting back rubbing their hands in glee."

Basically within an hour and filling out a 2 page application they were measuring us for a uniform. Green cards no problem. I was making 20K at the Steel plant and the wage was 12K a year, to be a Cop in Miami. Many down there are just not qualified to do that job. Simple as that. Watch the A@E series 60 Days In. Regular citizens are put in lock up for 60 days. One was a female Cop. She had serious mental issues and I cringe to think she carried a gun. After the series was over she quit.

Thats my point here. The guy gets pulled over for a traffic violation...hes got his family in the car and if you actually watch the video taken by his wife/girlfriend, the cop who murdered the guy is clearly distraught and you can tell he knows he screwed up. He made a very very bad decision based on what i percieve to be a bias. That a black male is dangerous and should be treated differently than a white man...thats the entire situation here, disparity in law enforcement.  IMO and the opinion of many others, if the driver is white, hes alive.  People are grasping at straws trying to give the cop the total benefit of the doubt...but what about the victim? We have some pretty serious video evidence, but we are all still grasping at straws trying to believe that the guy that got shot is guilty...come on guys  Now weve got people that have lost their minds just adding a whole pile more fuel to the fire...this whole thing is tragic as hell."

Thats a really slippery slope.  The big problem in the States is that there are so many officers being shot at that they are very Leary when ever they pull some one over. They are on edge and in fear for their own lives in a lot of places. I can say if I was a cop down there I would be no different.  The problem in this case is the gentleman said he had a CC permit and was reaching. What he should have done if this was actually the case is kept his hands on the wheel and told the officer where the firearm was so the officer could take control of it while dealing with the individual.

Theres plenty of evidence and facts here to show logically what happened.  - We have a man driving being pulled over for a basic traffic violation. - The man is not a felon, nor a criminal because he works in a school with kids. - The man is with his family including a young child in the vehicle - The man has informed the officer that he is armed - We have a video of a damn good witness (sitting in the seat next to the victim) making a clear statement of what happened - The witness feels compelled to take video of the situation because she wants to make it very clear that there was malice on the part of the victim - The cop is clearly distraight at what he has just done  Those are the facts  yet somehow we are still trying to say that we are ""on the fence"" as to the victims guilt? Thats a bit of a stretch by any length. The only argument to the contrary is that ""he was probably reaching for his gun to shoot the cop"" like seriously?! The only reason a cop should be shooting someone is if they are being shot at themselves or their lives are in jeopardy in some way. I think its a very very very long stretch to say that this was the scenario."

975897,Dara,2016-07-08 15:40:00,3052," The big problem in the States is that there are so many officers being shot at that they are very Leary when ever they pull some one over. They are on edge and in fear for their own lives in a lot of places. I can say if I was a cop down there I would be no different.  The problem in this case is the gentleman said he had a CC permit and was reaching. What he should have done if this was actually the case is kept his hands on the wheel and told the officer where the firearm was so the officer could take control of it while dealing with the individual. And then returning it when done. I'm going with this...when a cop in the USofA tells you to do something, you do it or risk getting shot.  Everybody there carries a gun the same as the cops so that is what they are up against every day...don't push them just because you have rights."
975898,Old Ironmaker,2016-07-08 15:45:00,8243,"This thread has morphed into a discussion of the police shootings this week. I thought it was about the 5 Cops being murdered in Dallas last night. CNN showed a photo taken by a citizen from up north, Ohio I think, and sent to authorities of a man with a camo shirt on, black cargo shorts and sneakers walking amongst the protesters. The reason the pic was taken was he had an AR type weapon slung over his shoulder amongst the crowd and no one, not a single person seemed to take note other than this guy from up north and 1 other that texted his photo to Police. Texas has an open carry policy and I guess that includes openly carrying an assault rifle in a public place with a massive Police presence. The man turned himself in after his face was shown on TV across the world. He had nothing to do with the shooting. I think this open display of an assault weapon during a protest is common place in Texas because not even the Police, and there were 100's of them, took notice. Strange is all I can say and I don't get it and can't believe a guy can walk around with a rifle strapped to his shoulder and no one took notice."

I'd like to see the facts (as opposed to what has been reported by the media) before passing judgement.  The victim's g/f filming and narrating the post that was on Facebook I see as one side to the story.  Speaking of the media, ""funny"" how some things are reported and some aren't:  http://fox2now.com/2016/07/08/report-officer-shot-in-ballwin-manhunt-underway/  Where is Obama's media release on this?  Where is BLM?  Seems even some of the Governors have jumped on the bandwagon, one stated that the driver wouldn't be dead if he were white.  I pray for our American friends, a sad week indeed."
975918,JoePa,2016-07-08 19:30:00,179,Let me point out a few things - I would suggest you search Police Brutality You Tube and view the thousands of instances where cops use excessive force and kill people - then you will get a picture of the deteriorating relationship between cops and the citizenry in the US - for years cops have gotten away with mistreating citizens but now because people are filming their encounters with police we see what is really happening - people are getting fed up with the way cops run rough shot over the people - they don't respect people's constitutional rights - they lie and when caught doing something illegal they file false reports - sure there are so-called good cops but all to often they just stand by and do nothing to stop a rough cop  I knew that something like Dallas would happen - cops need to act as servants and not like a bunch of SS bullies
