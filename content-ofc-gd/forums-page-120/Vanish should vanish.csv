976499,dave524,2016-07-14 09:46:00,4508,"Same for me. Love the Trilene XT.   It is also the line spooled in 4LB test on all my panfish reels. IMHO it is the best 4 LB line for my needs.  Edit to add....Vanish is complete junk. I really can't believe it is still on the market.  4lb. XT has been my go to for steelhead leaders since the 80's, bet it is tests out at 6-7 lbs if the truth be known."
976503,Mister G,2016-07-14 12:17:00,1429,"There are other alternatives.  In such a situation, I would use a very thin titanium leader or why not a bottom bouncer. Ya, but I have a worm harness system that is different from everyone else..........and it has worked for about 35 years and I'm not changing now............yesterday I boated about 15 walleyes while others did almost nothing..."
976572,Sinker,2016-07-14 20:17:00,8692,"I run 50lb braid and 17lb mono on the harness. Very rarely do I break off. Just check line regularily. If I get broken off, its a musky 100% of the time. Never had an issue with zebra mussels yet....I can re-tie a harness in like 30 seconds. LOL  S."
976574,Moosebunk,2016-07-14 20:20:00,3970,Drennan under 10lbs... Pretty well anything but Vanish over 10lbs.
976220,wkrp,2016-07-11 21:02:00,656,I am looking for a good quality  8lb leader material for making my own walleye rigs. Not at all satisfied with the title brand
976228,Bill Shearer,2016-07-11 21:59:00,456,There are so many good quality fluorocarbon leaders available. Don't be stuck on just one brand. I personally like Rio but I'm sure you will get many more recommendations. Vanish is one of the worst from what I have read on the forums.
976230,Canuck2fan,2016-07-11 22:10:00,1444,I switched to Seaguar for chrome and have found it to be a lot more abrasive resistant than Vanish. One downside though is for some reason I find it a lot harder to see to tie properly.... Overall though I like it better it also seems to stay more limber in freezing temps.
976233,misfish,2016-07-11 22:24:00,29133,"For my leaders, I have been using P-Line floro clear since I came apon it. Thats years ago. Still do. 10-8 pd for my bass needs.  I really like Sufix floro in the 6 pd for my steel heading. Been using it now for the past 3 years. Very strong . And yes, hard to see to tie, for me anyways, but worth it."
976240,Sinker,2016-07-11 23:12:00,8692,Just use mono. I out fish almost everyone who fishes with me using it against fluoro. I dont see any advantage at all.  Trilene xt.  S.
976242,MJL,2016-07-11 23:55:00,2427,"Berkley Vanish is a horrible, horrible product. I've never experienced as many unexplained line breaks as I've had with Berkley Vanish.  For worm harnesses, I've used mono and fluorocarbon in 10-12lb. Both work and couldn't really tell the difference in catch rates.  Mono I've used: Trilene XT, Excalibur Silverthread and P-Line Floroclear (blend of both mono/fluorocarbon)  Fluoro I've used: Seaguar AbrazX"
976247,adempsey,2016-07-12 01:09:00,1498,"12 or 15 lb test Berkley Big Game.  Works for me.  I even used 20lb test.  I also use Stren Heavy Cover that I picked up in a discount bin, but not sure they even make that anymore.  It's stiff and doesn't have a ton of stretch so it's great for harnesses.  It's also inexpensive.  Leave fluoro for your leader.  If you  must use 8lb fluoro, just go with whatever Seaguar you can afford.   I found the STS Steelhead series to be reasonably priced and have been using that for my leaders."
976253,jedimaster,2016-07-12 01:45:00,3472,Seaguar.   Thread can be locked. Haha
976258,kickingfrog,2016-07-12 03:03:00,8333,Vanish isn't meant as leader line. Use flouro that is meant for leaders.
976259,manitoubass2,2016-07-12 03:16:00,11391,I like vanish for ice fishing. Thats about it though
976263,wormdunker,2016-07-12 06:36:00,1711,I only use Seaguar fluoro for leaders or harnesses.  8 lb for tying my go getters for the smaller walleye in the north country & 20 lb for my worm harnesses for the hogs we get on Lake Erie.
976266,NANUK,2016-07-12 10:34:00,797,Seaguar Abrazx

976278,Andy,2016-07-12 12:22:00,330,X2 on the Big Game mono.
976280,Dutch01,2016-07-12 12:43:00,1431,I like Trilene Sensation in 6 pound for walleye. It's a little thinner than XT/XL and has a little less stretch as far as I can tell.
976281,BillM,2016-07-12 12:44:00,17367,"30lb XT for topwaters, 20lb Seaguar for anything that sinks.    For steel its usually Phantom or Drennan."
976292,porkpie,2016-07-12 14:36:00,2521,"I use fluoro for leader materiel.  Seaguar STS in 10 and 12.  But for harnesses and the like, I use 12lb big game.  It's cheap and comes in bulk spools and works very well for a worm harness and that sort of thing."
976326,Dabluz,2016-07-12 18:04:00,701,"I hate fluorocarbon line.  The worst was Vanish and the second worst was Seagar.  I've tried many and I just can't trust any of them.  I am a light line fisherman.  For fly fishing, I have even gone down to 3/4 lb tippets with size 26 flies.  I have been using 2 to 4 lb mono for decades and I know light line.  When shore fishing, I have pulled out logs with 4 lb test mono that had all kinds of lures and other goodies stuck to them. Right now, Berkley Sensation is my favourite.  It's a co-polymer line with great characteristics.  You want to catch fish.....finesse is the trick.  A thick fluorocarbon line gives off more vibrations than a fine mono.  Try using a small high quality hook baited with the head of a big nightcrawler on 2 to 4 lb mono with nothing else on the line.  That's right.....nothing else on the line.  I can tell you all this because none of you fish in my region.  I don't tell anyone in my region this.  I especially like 3 lb mono but I have to order it from Europe where finesse fishing is a must."
976330,Mister G,2016-07-12 18:22:00,1429,Just use mono. I out fish almost everyone who fishes with me using it against fluoro. I dont see any advantage at all.  Trilene xt.  S. Pulling worm harnesses over rock piles on Lake Erie that are covered with zebra mussels is where fluoro carbon shines. I went from 12 lb mono to 20 lb FC because I was loosing to many rigs because of the sharp edges the mussels have.
976341,Joeytier,2016-07-12 19:40:00,3990,"Vanish isn't meant as leader line. Use flouro that is meant for leaders. It's still insanely weak, no excuse for that.  I use main line mono usually (can't justify the extra cost for fluorocarbon) and it works perfect, it's not rocket science.  If you insist on using fluorocarbon, then Seaguar is where it's at."
976356,kickingfrog,2016-07-12 21:37:00,8333,If cost is the issue then use braid. It last for years and then you flip it around and use it a few more years. Mono has it's place.
976359,wkrp,2016-07-12 21:46:00,656,"After all of your  recommendations  it seems that seaguar is the choice, but where the heck do you buy this brand in an 8lb test.  The floro line is readily available but not the leader material."
976360,bare foot wader,2016-07-12 21:58:00,1354,"most line sections tend to have a leader section, if not look for fluoro tippet in the fly fishing section  and agreed that vanish is horrible stuff"
976368,porkpie,2016-07-12 23:12:00,2521,"If you must have 8, then look for a shop that sells seaguar STS.  It comes in 100 yard spools for a reasonable price.  Lebaron sells it.  I've been using regular seaguar yellow box in 200 yard spools as leaders for steelhead fishing for years though.  It works pretty well and I've used it for pics as well.  Reason I switched to STS is that it comes on a smaller spool and I find it's handier both in the boat and in my stream bag."
