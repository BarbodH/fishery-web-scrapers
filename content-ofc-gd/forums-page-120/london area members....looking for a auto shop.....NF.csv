977118,DanD,2016-07-20 08:51:00,2223,No offence to adempsey but both of those shops are automotive repair facilities; like myself. Good shops but they don't do upholstery Dixie auto trim has a very long standing reputation for quality work; but they do know how to charge for their services.  Dan.

I know nothing about cars and don't even know what a headliner is.    Just assumed it was something an auto repair shop could take care of
