976647,MJL,2016-07-15 14:19:00,2427,"I'd be more worried about foreign (possibly negative) scents deterring fish from biting...Then again, some people use WD40 as scent...  Flambeau has a tackle box called the Zerust where the plastic dividers exude some sort of anti-rust vapour (or something like that). I bought one box but haven't yet had it long enough to really determine if it actually works. I bought it because it was 30% cheaper than anything else I could find in the store.  Don't know why my lures seem to rust more in winter than they do in summer."
976657,Sinker,2016-07-15 16:55:00,8692,Zerust is crap. I can show you one that is full of rusty lures.  Wd 40 works though. A light spray and it does keep things from rusting in the box.  I hate rust.  S.
976660,NANUK,2016-07-15 17:11:00,797,"Let your lures dry before puting them back in tackle trays, If you have to pack them wet, air them out at home, I have some pretty old lures, no rust.  I wouldn't spray no chemicals on the lures, not good for the environment, your hands and it doesn't help with fishing. WD40 is actually corrosive, that's why it is a penetrant, try on patio door track (aluminum), you will see pitting in a year or two."
