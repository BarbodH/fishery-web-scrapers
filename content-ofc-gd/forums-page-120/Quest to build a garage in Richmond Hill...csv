When I was working on my plot of land, there was no easement or drainage plan.   Everyone I spoke to with the town was more at why I could not proceed than how to move forward.  If you want movement, just build it. They will have to put everything in writing on what you need to do to make it legal or take it down.  good luck"

976518,Dutch01,2016-07-14 14:45:00,1431,Are you sure about the 294.7m elevation? If so that would mean the entire city of Toronto (at elevation 76m) would be a flood plain yet we build all over it. That seems strange to me.

They say it's because it's hazardous land and want to control the flood plain.  If they were truly concerned about flood plains and hazardous lands, they would have insisted on land conveyance of the property 1 block away from me that got the variance in the meeting I went to in May.  Why didn't they want this other guys land you ask, because he is on a residential street and his property is surrounded by other privately owned lands, there is no financial benefit for the town to own this property.  I'm going to the meeting in August either way. I hear nothing from the planning department since May until I email the committee of adjustments Representative saying put me on the list for August and I'm seriously considering a law suit.  Then I get an email from the planning department within the hour! RIDICULOUS!     Try and have paper from the neighbor showing his approval and then they will have to justify disapproval for reasons other than flood plain"

976637,RangerGuy,2016-07-15 12:03:00,564,"Thank you everybody for your input. To be clear of what I'm out for the lawsuit these rough numbers because I don't have my reciepts on me but...  1) TRCA Permit: 500 2) Engineering Letter: 500 3) Survey and grading plan (This was required even if I had one, they said they'd want a new one) 3000 4) Minor Variance Application : 4000  Not Paid yet but I have to 1) TRCA Additional Charge: 500 (because the town contacted them with questions even though I already have TRCA Permit) 2) Building Permit: 500 (roughly) 3) Grading Permit: 500 (roughtly, and I can't change the grade!)  So 8,000 to date and I haven't broken ground.... gone!  Also, after the suggestions to contact the news, I contacted CityTV again and they called me and took my story for research..hopefully they will cover it. Global News also wants me to send my info and they will let me know.   Again thank you all for the support! 24 more signatures till I have 100! WOOT!

They could have taken his money but tried to persuade him not to pay the fee but he insisted, no permit has ever been issued for a building on that stretch of land at that time some years back. He has been in and out of court for 16 years, appealed the OMB etc. He has a problem that man one of which is having too much money."

But the city has requested that he gift them part of his land in exchange for issuing the permit.  This is a completely different case than the example that you provided.  In the example that you provided; it appears that the land is considered environmentally sensitive and no should not be developed.  In that case you are out the fees and you still don’t get to build.  In this case the result of the environmental assessment is that there is no reason to reject a permit.  However, the city has requested that he gift part of his land in exchange for issuing the permit.  Perhaps there is a valid reason for tying the gift of land with the permit.  I cannot think of a valid reason; but one may exist.  If the city does indeed have a valid reason for tying the gift of land to the issuance of a permit; then the OP will be back to square one with having to choose between keeping his land, or building a garage.  If the city is not able to establish a valid connection between issuing a permit and gifting the land, then he may have the option of getting the fees back; or being able to build the garage and keep his land.  If it turns out that the city was simply using as an opportunity to extort the land; then there should be criminal charges against those involved."
976668,SirCranksalot,2016-07-15 19:37:00,3291,Bear in mind that the city has no obligation to approve a minor variance. The onus is on the applicant to make the case for approval. If they approved all applications the committee could be replaced by a rubber stamp.

976706,Old Ironmaker,2016-07-16 01:23:00,8243,"I didn't give a good example. My point is how can one sue for ""non refundable fees"" and win.  And I think this is criminal extortion."

If they approved all applications the committee could be replaced by a rubber stamp.  But it seem that they have approved this one.  Now they want some free land in exchange for doing so.  Perhaps there is a valid logical reason for tying the free land to the issuance of the permit; but, if there isn't then this would seem to be extortion.    I didn't give a good example. My point is how can one sue for ""non refundable fees"" and win.  And I think this is criminal extortion.  The lawsuit doesn't have to be to recover the fees; it could be to allow him to build without having to give them half of his land.  Or, if there are extenuating circumstances; they the court could order the fees to be returned.  I do agree that under normal cirmcustances the fees would not be refunded if your application was rejected.  But, that is not what seems to be happening here."
976811,RangerGuy,2016-07-17 14:23:00,564,"Hi All,  Town will not give you anything in writing, other than the Staff Letter. The Committee of Adjustment representative advises that you speak with each department before applying for the minor variance, to confirm they don't see any issues with your plans.  You speak to planning they say things like: ""We want to make sure it fits the neighborhood"" or ""Is this structure going to block a neighbors view of something"", I find this very reasonable.  Now because of my situation they said: ""We can't advise you because you need approval from ""TRCA"". It's this point that they should have told me about their own rules on flood plan and the official plan.  I got approval via a permit, and revisited planning department. They said: ""Well, great you got approval, We don't see any reason that you should not apply for your variance"" .... NOT .... ""Your applying for a minor variance, because you have flood plain on your property , we will most likely ask you to convey land to us and will need the MNR, Parks, Planning, TRCA and your surveyor to stake out the hazard land"".  You see they want me to bring my surveyor back on my dime! To stake out the land they want and to stake my garage... NOT HAPPENING! My surveyor staked my land last year, I do not by law have to pay a surveyor to stake my garage for me. They even said we want all these departments on your property at the same time to watch you stake your garage.. THAT'S RIDICULOUS!  The planning departments staff letter to the committee of adjustments (which explains their general opinions of the planned development) states they see no issue with my garage and that it fits with the neighborhood, but they will not approve permit without land conveyance..  I know a variance is not guaranteed, the vote could go any direction. This is not my issue and knew that going in. My issue is the town with held information or omitted information when I went to them for guidance and now is extorting my land.  Also, they are not seeking land conveyance consistently. Several properties of lesser value have had to get TRCA flood plain approval with in this area, these have not had to gift land because they do not have as high monetary value.  Again thank you everybody for the support!!!"
976332,RangerGuy,2016-07-12 18:34:00,564,"Hi All,  I posted back in January, looking for help to find a good concrete company to do our foundation and floor for the garage we are hoping to build. We got more help than I ever expected! So a big thank you to all the people who offered great suggestions.  If you can believe it we still have not started this project.  A little back story I will try to keep it short as possible.  Since February 2015 I have been talking with Richmond Hills Planning,Building and Zoning departments. We have some flood plain on our property which really is a joke but none the less, we got the required approval from TRCA that we are not effecting the flood plain as per Richmond Hills instruction.  After I got our TRCA permit I went back to the town and asked the planning department if there is anything else I need to know before applying for the minor variance. I expressly told them I have never done this before, so I am really looking for guidance and want to make sure I have everything correct because a minor variance application in our township is $4000 and is non-refundable, they said everything looks ok but it's really up to the committee, so I applied for my minor variance.  After forcing me to delay from the April meeting to the May meeting, they call me 3 hours before I can defer the May meeting for free (otherwise it's a over $1000 dollar charge by the committee) to tell me they will approve my permit if I give them my land (how much they couldn't tell me, but most likely will be over 1/2 of my lot) for free!  The town is extorting my land from me because they know I have spent 1000's in fees and permits that is non-refundable. Even the TRCA has informed them that it is not an appropriate situation to seek land conveyance but they refuse to change their demands.  So just to be clear, the town is saying ""We will give you a permit, if and only if you give over 1/2 your land for free"".  I have spoken with our Councillor, Mayor and the Ontario Ombudsman's office, all of which have no interest in helping us!  I am hoping after you read this thread and hopefully my petition,  you will see how absurd our situation is and support us by signing our petition.  Please sign our petition, to help save our land!

I am going to try Global News, in case i missed that one  What bugs me, now that I know there is such a thing as an ""Official Plan"" that the planners use, I would have consulted it before spending all this money. They never once said because you have flood plain and are applying for a minor variance, we will ask you for a land conveyance.  I spoke to them several times before I even working with TRCA to make sure I wasn't just wasting money and had a chance at building my garage, I could have decided to not do it in the first place if they were honest and forth coming with information.  TRCA made me get a letter from an engineer saying the proposed garage would not effect the flood plain, which I did and they issued me a permit no problem.  Richmond Hill is using this desire to ""Protect"" this land as a guise to acquire valuable land near a major intersection!  I have thought about the lawyer route, I still have the OMB to try. I can do that without a lawyer and if that fails I will be suing for sure! If for anything but to get my money back!  Please feel free to pass this link on to anybody!

Niagara Escarpment Commissions, permit #1, Niagara Conservation Authority, permit #2, local jurisdiction, permit #3, then if construction is within 300 meters of a highway under the auspices of the MOT, permit #4, then of course every other job requires a variance that is non refundable, goof tax #5. Oops, I forgot it was in The Greenbelt whatever that means, permit #6. Then there is the idiot at City Hall that makes it clear he like Blue Jays games or you file might not make it to the top of the pile. That was when I lost it and contacted the Police and 5 of them got fired after a 2 year investigation. All that cost is enough to put a small company trying to play be all the rules out of business, oh yea I did pack it in when it was obvious it was killing me and was not able to make a thin dime. My business partner continued until he was charged with assaulting a building inspector.  Unfortunately Ranger Guy has a tough road ahead of him. Knowing what I know now if I were he I would buy a new place that has a garage. As they say you can't fight City Hall. Actually you can fight them you just can't win.

976412,RangerGuy,2016-07-13 12:02:00,564,"I was totally expecting to have all the trouble with the conservation authority, but surprisingly they were the easiest to deal with. It took me months to get out of the planner what they expected to see in the engineers letter but once I had that it was a breeze.  I have a very small section of my garage that is below what they call the flood plain line (294.8 meters above sea level). If you draw a line where my garage is very small thin triangle starting at the rear east corner and going up about 10 feet is 294.7 meters above the sea level. So that is .1 meters difference so I needed an engineers letters stating we would not effect the flood plain. I got it and they issued the permit.  It's the town that's being absurd, after I got the TRCA Permit they said...OH we have our own rules regarding flood plains.. the the Bull started.  Why would they not entertain that conversation before hand, because they saw it as an under handed way to extort land from me!  We actually did try to sell our house, but couldn't find anything we liked/needed that wouldn't greatly increase our commute to work  Again please get all you can to sign this permit, I know it probably won't accomplish anything but it's another bullet to take through the court system!"

Why didn't they want this other guys land you ask, because he is on a residential street and his property is surrounded by other privately owned lands, there is no financial benefit for the town to own this property.  I'm going to the meeting in August either way. I hear nothing from the planning department since May until I email the committee of adjustments Representative saying put me on the list for August and I'm seriously considering a law suit.  Then I get an email from the planning department within the hour! RIDICULOUS!    I'm more interested in why they want half your land?  They will never tell you they expect a land conveyance. They want you in a position where you would be hard pressed to turn down the offer."
