977168,Old Ironmaker,2016-07-20 20:54:00,8243,"Try some marine adhesive like 3M 5200. Better than any super glue. Maybe try 4800 first because once 5200 is applied it will never, ever come off."

976817,misfish,2016-07-17 15:42:00,29133,"The day started out so nice as you can see    As the morning went on, I noticed the right toon was going down slowly. So no biggie,just go in and tighten with the supplied factory wrench. Not to tight, just snug. Blow it back up to 1.5 bar and head back out. Wouldnt you know it, it was still going down. So not to get caught with a flat toon, I headed in and home. Grab the valve out of the old one I kept as a spare and swap them out. Put the old one in the new and the new in the old and blow them both up. The new one still went down slowly and the old one held strong.  On closer looking at the new one, I found this. The insert was cracked in many places.  Would you say this is a defect? I never did anything wrong to this. Just tighten snug as the label on the toon says.    I will be sending the pic to the distributor in the states. Im hoping I can get a replacement.  For now, Im good as the old one will replace this one. I now have a  Kineirokie toon.LOL Why I dont throw things away. Glad I didnt.      "

E mail complaints have a tendency to find the delete button, I know that from experience, if a customer is serious they will call and wait the 25 minutes or more to hear from a human being. Put in a few, ""I love the product"", ""it is the best I have had"", ""I hope we can resolve this because I want to continue to recommend your companies Pontoons"". Is there a warranty on it? If it has expired I might not even bother, just get it repaired and call it a day because that will be a long uphill battle. I might check the internet forums and research as to whether this is an ongoing problem with this companies valves. look at iboats.com pontoon and inflatable forum. I'm a member there, great boating forum. Sometimes they will extend warranties for a known defect. Probably just send a valve in that case and have you cover the labour.  What is the name of the company and model. I might have some time tomorrow to research for you as I know you are busy working or fishing. I blew my knee out Thursday so I won't be going too far for another few days.  Add the exact model number in the letter and find the receipt. Tell them this is your second purchase of the same company. Does a cracked valve definitively cause a leak?  Good luck Sir and be like a Pit Bull with a bone, only a polite Pit Bull."

The plastic body is in the bladder. There are cracks all the way down the port. I could hear the leak.  I will print off what I emailed and send it in the morning as a back up.  Thanks Johnny."

I was able to buy a replacement through them for much cheaper than anywhere else.  Hi Tom yes, you are correct.  Im just very surprised at the amount of cracks in the valve cage ,as you call it. This should not happen IMO, to this unit only being a year and a bit old. Still waiting to hear back.  I did, at my own fault, bust a bladder on my old toon. I deflatted, but the valve closed up. The heat it,self, expanded the bladder and burst it. The replacement bladder was 150 usa shipped. If this is the case, I,ll just deal with what I have, and start looking at a fishing yak.  I hope they see it as a simple replacement. Fingers crossed.  I will say this though. The older toon is much better built then the new one. The bladder it,self is heavier material and the cover is thicker.  Just like everything these days, older made is always better.LOL  Thanks for the reply  And you other wisenhimers,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,       "

Waiting for reply on that. I thought it was a whole bladder, but I guess the port can be removed. I dont see it.  Also pm,ed Tom, as he has dealt with this."
