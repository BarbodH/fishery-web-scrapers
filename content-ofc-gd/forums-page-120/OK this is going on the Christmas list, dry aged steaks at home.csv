What they do have, is very slim and dosent look that great. The new zhers have this ""posh"", butcher thing now, and want an arm and a leg for a steak. Many cuts of meat aged like 20-40 days and more. Im not paying that price for a piece of meat. I will try as you say Steve. Just for s and giggles.  They did have extra lean ground knocked down again, 3 bucks a pack. Smitty bacon on for the same. Looks like a bacon wrapped meat loaf this day. Im good with that.  I did want to try this pork belly thing I found on you tube, but I cant even find that up here for a decent price.

A local shop had centre cut chops on for $3.99/LB last week. Bought 8 good sized...not huge....but cut nice and thick. $23.92. Three bucks cheaper and enough meat for 4 BBQ's instead of just one."

My wife wouldn't have it. My butcher will dry age beef for us. No not cheap. I do know I want to punch this guy in the snout.
976473,leaf4,2016-07-13 23:43:00,2466,"Haha, for $200 though and when I already have a mini fridge I can use, this thing will pay for itself in a few uses, you can take a $40 roast and turn it into how many steaks worth $40 a piece?  And yeah that guy is annoying but it's a good show of what it will do"
976535,AKRISONER,2016-07-14 16:25:00,5558,how the hell do you plug the thing in if its inside the fridge though? thats got me really confused?
976536,Terry,2016-07-14 16:29:00,14456,"it is a low voltage wire and it goes out the door of the fridge, they even showed it at the door and magnetic strip and taped to the outside of the fridge to keep the wire in place"
976547,DanD,2016-07-14 17:27:00,2223,"I've been using the Umai ""drybag"" for aging my roasts/steaks.  http://www.drybagsteak.com/shop-drybag-steak-in-house.php  Works great; put the meat in one of these bags, vacuum seal it and put it in a frost free fridge. When its lost approx 35-40% of its weight; you're ready to go and enjoy. There's no cross contamination of smells or tastes, in the meat you're aging or in the fridge itself. I've made Capicola (Italian Beacon) in these bags and I couldn't tell it from deli store for taste and texture. 3 bags (16"" X 28"") for $25.00 and you can easily fit a 12 - 14lb ribeye roast in one of the bags.

976627,crappieperchhunter,2016-07-15 04:12:00,2582,I have been aging all our prime rib roasts in our fridge for maybe 7 years now. Can't remember where I got the info....on the internet somewhere. Just put the bare prime rib roast on a baking rack in the fridge and leave it. I usually do 5-7 days. Have always been afraid to try longer. It really does effect the taste and the texture of the meat...and we all love it. It does get a little waxy and tough on the outside so sometimes you have to trim the outside off...but most of the time I don't have to.  Give it a go first before you throw any money at this gizmo. I think you will be happy with the results.

The salt will help pull the moisture out of the roast. Not sure why; but they recommend Hymalayn pink sea salt; maybe because of its purity? The last one I did (14 days), I had to soak the salt dish in water; the salt had gone rock hard. But the meat, after trimming off the outer layer, had a great colour and the aroma was amazing.

Thx Dan. I'm real happy with how the roasts turn out now. Not sure if I'll change my routine or not....but I appreciate the input.  When you did this for 14 days was the bare roast just sitting on the rack in the open air the whole time? I have always been hesitant to try for longer then my 5-7 days because I have always been worried about the meat going bad. Also have you tried the same process without the salt?"
976640,DanD,2016-07-15 13:20:00,2223,"No I have not tried this without the salt and yes the roast is sitting in the open; but I'm using a second fridge that doesn't get opened anywhere near as much as the kitchen one is. Once that dried skin forms on the outside of the meat, I think you're safe. It kind of self seals stopping bacteria from growing. Not to worry, if the meat has gone bad, you'll know once you cut into it. It'll have a funky smell and the meat will be squishy.  Dan"
