976444,Joey,2016-07-13 17:53:00,9122,"My son borrowed my camera and lives on the 17th floor of a building across from a cemetery near downtown.  I'm having problems sharing it on facebook.  Let me know if you can watch it please.  It's pretty good,  but I'm his mom so......  "
976445,Bill Shearer,2016-07-13 17:59:00,456,Excellent! He has been taught well!
976446,BillM,2016-07-13 18:04:00,17367,"Very cool, just gotta make sure those horizons are straight"
976447,Bill Shearer,2016-07-13 18:24:00,456,"Very cool,  Could have done the rest by PM. IMO."
976448,DanD,2016-07-13 18:51:00,2223,Nicely done! I watched it twice.  Dan.
976449,BillM,2016-07-13 18:52:00,17367," Could have done the rest by PM. IMO.  I'm sure Joey said the exact same thing to him, lol!"
976452,Terry,2016-07-13 19:32:00,14456,It was great
976454,misfish,2016-07-13 20:13:00,29133,That was awesome J.  I wanted to jump through my screen and roll around in that snow. LOL   Super job.
976472,ketchenany,2016-07-13 23:37:00,3229,Very nice work.
976477,Joey,2016-07-14 00:17:00,9122,"Thanks guys, I loved it too, glad you can see it, I don't know what's wrong with the FB edition.  Alan was here today to borrow the camera again.  I think I've created a picture taking monster like myself. We shall see the results"
976487,MJL,2016-07-14 01:44:00,2427,Very cool  Do you know what software your son used to stitch it all together? I've been meaning to get out for some timelapse making the past few years but never got around to it. Even have a motor/slider that I haven't even used yet.LOL
976491,Joey,2016-07-14 02:51:00,9122,Very cool  Do you know what software your son used to stitch it all together?

Thanks MJL
976505,blaque,2016-07-14 13:00:00,2419,Get this boy his own camera lol.......very talented!  I also keep saying im gonna play with some timelapse and still havent gotten to it lol
976561,Old Ironmaker,2016-07-14 18:56:00,8243,"Yep, same DNA, no doubt there. Good stuff."
976566,misfish,2016-07-14 20:00:00,29133,"Question here J  I would amagine one would need a large capacity battery to do this. Not the whole film, but the segments he did. I would need to buy a million AA batteries. LOL  Also, how do you guys do this timelapse thing?  I would love to put a collection of sunrises together. I would have to start it next year as I would like to do one or two from each month of the year starting in January. I could do the ones in the winter months from my ice hub with the heater on to keep me and the camera warm.  Im sure the growth of a fiddle head with the sun heat on it ,would be cool to do. I could just leave the camera on while Im fishing the river. LOL  Thanks for the answers."
976618,Joey,2016-07-15 02:41:00,9122,"K I'll get back to you on that B, I have never done time lapse myself.  Gonna have to talk to the boy"
976620,Joey,2016-07-15 03:11:00,9122,Okay apparently the timelapse was done on the stock camera timelapse app on ipad which he says is on iphone aswell and he finished it with adobe premiere pro
977054,BillM,2016-07-19 20:25:00,17367,"Some cameras have a built-in intervalometer, most don't...  This is what you'd use to tell the camera to take a pic every 5 mins for the next 8-10hrs or so.   Like Joey said you can also hook this up to a smart phone or tablet or even a PC..   It's pretty cool and fairly simple.   Like she posted, you can get some killer mini movies out of it!    I need to try this with the Milky Way before it disappears this year."
977056,MJL,2016-07-19 20:34:00,2427,I need to try this with the Milky Way before it disappears this year.  This is what I've wanted to do for the past 4-5yrs. Finding perfectly dark skies and dark places to shoot is getting a lot harder in Southern Ontario  It's the only reason I bought the Canon 16-35mm f/2.8 II.LOL
977101,Raf,2016-07-20 03:05:00,3495,"Very cool Joey  To shoot timelapse, you need a camera that has the feature.  I would imagine most DSLRs have one.   My Olympus OMD-EM10 mirrorless camera does. I can shoot up to 999 shots at any interval I choose.  you'll propably want a tripod, turn off any image stabilization (to conserve battery) and shoot in manual mode."
977122,BillM,2016-07-20 12:05:00,17367," This is what I've wanted to do for the past 4-5yrs. Finding perfectly dark skies and dark places to shoot is getting a lot harder in Southern Ontario  It's the only reason I bought the Canon 16-35mm f/2.8 II.LOL  Very hard to find dark skies in Southern Ontario, just too much light pollution, especially when we're talking 30s exposure times and always facing south..   Even some of the 'Dark Sky' preserves I've found aren't good (Although they're ok for looking at the stars)."
