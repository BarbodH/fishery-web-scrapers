976607,HTHM,2016-07-14 23:49:00,4082,I would suggest that you don't either. Setting yourself up for a lifetime of maintenance
976613,Beans,2016-07-15 01:40:00,3339,Bloody interlock crap...I'm sure it was a government make-work project...I have to get it reset every couple or three years due to frost heave up...Grrr.

I did the driveway and walkways at my last house, and you had to watch your step when it was wet. $150 taxes in is close to what I paid for a pail in 2012 before we moved.  There is an anti-slip additive you can put in the sealer and it makes a huge difference.  I did mine without the additive 2 years ago and it was so slippery I had to re-do again last year.  Huge difference and wife is happy now.... I win!  If you want to seal your concrete or pavers,  CPD Products are some of the best on the market (not necessarily 'Green' however).  I have used Cipadeck on a number of stamped and exposed aggregate driveways & sidewalks.   You can get it at most of the concrete supply places and CRS rentals.   CPD also has an anti-slip powder you just mix in before spraying and it's makes a huge difference.  http://www.cpd.ca/products/division-7/dampproofing-and-waterproofing"
