975827,AKRISONER,2016-07-07 23:00:00,5558,bunk...can i tell that you are excited? you dropped the report on us before even leaving!  jealousy doesnt begin to describe the envy that most of feel towards the opportunity you are presented with.
975839,the spirit of fishing,2016-07-08 01:17:00,141,It certainly sounds like you're excited and I can't blame you. I'm sure all your homework will pay off and it'll be another great adventure. Can't wait to read about your trip.
975858,DRIFTER_016,2016-07-08 04:04:00,10439,One of my best times char fishing was casting from shore on islands about 10 miles or so out in the Coronation Gulf out of Kugluktuk NT. What a hoot it was pitching spoons into the ocean and having big feisty chrome char smoke your lures. Most were heading East to ascend the Coppermine River. Biggest we got that day was about 15#'s or so. Good times.

Would love to swing it to Kug one summer, do those islands maybe, jump over to the Tree but more importantly make the long trek up to the Bloody.  Cam Bay would be mint too... but so would anywhere really. As long as their a need for my trade and these windows I'll be dreaming and scheming about ways to make it happen. Beautiful country as you know."
975862,Sinker,2016-07-08 12:09:00,8692,"11 days till we leave for nfld. Dad knows one of the only places on the island to catch arctic char. We are gonna giver a whirl. Ive caught them there before, but they were small.  Looks like you have a great trip planned man! Cant wait to hear about it!  S."

Forget the wolves, PB go long periods of time without eating so they are motivated! They will stalk you for miles, and isn't the summer the feeding season cause those darn seals don't have to pop their heads up out of the ice? It sounds like a dream but you better be packing."

Their main feeding season is the winter and they slow way down during the summer...but that does not mean they would pass on a free meal walking by them :-i  ROOK"
976512,scuro2,2016-07-14 14:32:00,904,"I should have said that summer time is when they often go without a meal for long periods of time, hence the motivation. They hunt with their noses and can smell a seal a mile away buried under the snow. Bunk is going to smell like one giant Big Mac with his love of bacon, cheese, and other fats.  Other interesting facts, the large males can take off your head with one swipe of their paw and they usually kill their victims by crushing their heads in their jaws. They also like to sneak up on unsuspecting fishermen too engrossed in arctic char. They will spend hours waiting and moving stealthy closer to their prey before they charge."

Some tidbits from online resources...  The Gulf of Boothia (GB) polar bear subpopulation is one of the largest in Canada and is managed entirely by Nunavut. The most recent demographic study on the GB subpopulation estimated the mean total number for the 1998-2000 study period to be 1,592 (Â± 361) bears. A new 3-year research project was initiated in 2015 to provide updated information on the abundance of bears in GB. This mark-recapture study differs from the previous studies that relied on chemical immobilization of all bears for capture and marking. This study does not involve capture of bears but instead utilizes DNA extracted from tissue samples obtained using biopsy darts to uniquely identify individuals. The sub-population abundance estimate and status will be assessed by means of genetic mark-recapture. Between 29 April and 26 May 2015, we spent 96 hours of helicopter flight time searching for polar bears. Most of the GB subpopulation range was surveyed but poor weather and logistical constraints limited the intensity of the coverage of the whole area. We flew a total distance of approximately 11,737 km searching for polar bears. A total of 185 bears (in 115 groups) of various age classes and both sexes were encountered, of which 152 were successfully biopsied. The rate of sampling averaged 1.8 bears per hour of search time. The number of bears encountered during the spring of 2015 was equivalent to approximately 10% of the previous 1998-2000 mark-recapture population estimate currently used for harvest management. However, until genetic results are available it is impossible to discern how many different individual bears were encountered. General impressions from the first year of sampling suggested that polar bears were abundant and in good condition in GB. Preliminary habitat use analysis showed that polar bear densities were higher than expected in active pack ice and lower than expected in shore fast ice. Seal observations suggested that shore fast ice was preferred by seals while they avoided inactive pack ice. Seal kill densities were higher than expected in active pack ice and brash ice (found mainly as a transition between shore fast ice and active pack ice) but lower than expected in shore fast ice. Preparations are under-way for the second field season which will begin in April of 2016.  Kugaaruk is in GB...  see the link...  https://polarbearscience.com/2013/06/18/gulf-of-boothia-unheralded-arctic-utopia-has-the-highest-density-of-polar-bears-worldwide/   Like the other guys said, it's obvious you're chomping at the bit Bunk. Who wouldn't be.  I would try to borrow a 12 gauge from somebody up there and keep checking over your shoulder.  Good luck Bunk, hopefully the fish are in, looking forward to reading about the adventure.  Thanks bud. Will see about a gun or even a local guide for sure. Everything I think I know about timing, the fishing, the land and such isn't by any means personal experience yet. Hope luck is on my side as everything may need to align just right for me to have the time to even catch a fish or two. Whatever happens though, it'll be a month in the arctic and surely better than sitting in my cool basement pounding on a keyboard. lol.  In the Arctic, bear time is anytime, at least that is what I have found in my travels, always pays to be alert  but just to clear up : summer the feeding season ? comment...............Polar bears are the only bear that do NOT hibernate = they ESTIVATE !!!!!!!!!   Their main feeding season is the winter and they slow way down during the summer...but that does not mean they would pass on a free meal walking by them :-i  ROOK  There's no messing around anytime. If they want a human for dinner they'll eat a human for dinner. No gun, I'll have to play safe and keep my head up. Thankfully the tundra this time of year is green, grey and flowery and a polar bear is still a giant, white, moving snowball out of place in July.  How much does a flight cost and what do you want me to bring?    You don't want to know.  Somewhere around $4K  Today's best rate with taxes, booking fees and out of Ottawa to Kugaaruk return about $5200. The employer will buy my ticket but not a second one, for anyone."
