It looks like an easy install but wondering about:  Gross Trailer Weight Max Tongue Load  These measurements basically work out the Max Pivot length for the coupling.  The unit comes with a chart but my 22""  tandem axle trailer was converted to a pontoon trailer and impossible to track down the exact into. My boat is a old 16' pontoon with a 30hp and I always assumed purchasing the used tandem trailer for conversion was overkill for safety etc.  For a 36"" pivot the chart shows a 6000lbs Gross Trailer Weight and 600lbs. Max Tongue Load spec.  Really want to get the boat in the garage this year...           "

I've gone to the dump with the boat and trailer to get a gross weight, then back with the trailer only. I've done it at a local quarry too, they charged me 10 bucks the second time.  Charlie Wray showed how to get the tongue weight on his show. Used a simple bathroom scale under the tongue wheel."
