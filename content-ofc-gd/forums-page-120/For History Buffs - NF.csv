His name is Dan Carlin.  He is an American historian who takes a look at different things in absolutely every possible angle. His work on the First World War was so informative that I learned things from him that I didn't know about and I spent 4 years at the U of Waterloo studying history lol.  He covers such topics as slavery, WW1 and 2, the aftermath of WW1, the Tunic wars, the apache's the Spanish American war, the rise of the Khans, etc. he has 47 episodes. Some are available on line on his website or through the apple podcasts.  His website and podcast site is called Hardcore History"

I'm listening to the four part series of eastern front of WW2 between Russian and Germany... Man both side were screwed regardless"
