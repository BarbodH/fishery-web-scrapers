I tried to go out this AM and you couldn't see the remodeled restaurant from my slip at Marshal's let alone the lake. Of course as soon as I got back on Rainham Rd. the sky clears and it has been gorgeous here all day with the lake as calm as a sleeping baby. Do you put in at Hoovers or Marshal's at Nanticoke? Marshal's is about 10 bucks less then Hoovers. It's not much of a secret now."

975440,Dabluz,2016-07-03 03:51:00,701,Nuisance fish are just part of the package. I catch 4 rock bass to every pickerel in some drifts on our cottage lake. I'm not sure light line makes a difference. I use 12lb fluorocarbon leader on most of my jigging and live bait rods and 15 to 17lb Fluoro leader on my trolling rods depending on what I find on sale. Believe me when I say that finesse does work.  I've been fishing walleye for over 60 years and I have seen many examples of one fisherman catching walleye on almost every cast while someone else in the boat is catching next to nothing when the only difference is in the size of the line.  I've seen when only the use of a snap instead of tying directly to the jig was the reason between zero strikes and many strikes.  12 lb line lets off vibrations when moving through the water.  4 lb line lets off 3 times less vibration.  A 1/16 ounce VMC wacky jig drops Ã  lot slower than a 1/4 ounce jig.  You can't feel a 1/16 ounce jig with 12 lb test line.  Casting the smallest size Live Action smelt imitation on 12 lb fluoro is impossible to do.  I've been using 4 lb mono for walleye for over 40 years and I rarely lose a lure except jigs.  Yesterday I was fishing in the Peribonka River that has a rock bottom.  The river was formed by eskers and the bottom is all loose round stones.  Real nightmare for jig fishermen.  I lost only 1 jig in 4 hours of fishing.  I also caught my limit of walleyes.  The trick is to not let the jig sit on bottom but to lift it immediately off bottom but keeping the jig very close to bottom.
975441,porkpie,2016-07-03 04:01:00,2521,"Technologies change, and so do the times.  Many years ago I fished steelhead most often with 3lb lead and very soft rods, and while I still fish fairly soft rods I don't often fish less than 8lb lead, and I'll do ten if I can get away with it.  By all means use what makes you comfortable but I put lots in the boat as is, so I'll be sticking with it!"
975444,Old Ironmaker,2016-07-03 04:17:00,8243,"That's supposed to be good not bad luck.  Tie directly from line to bait, jig or hook. The least amount of terminal tackle the best. Trolling use the best quality and smallest snap swivel to your bait."

975550,Dabluz,2016-07-04 22:58:00,701,"Question...  Is it illegal to flash a light into the water when fishing for walleye at night? Here in Quebec, using lights is legal.  Using lights is illegal only for salmon fishing but salmon fishing after sunset is illegal anyway.  I worked as a conservation officer and almost everyone I encountered were under the impression that using lights when fishing at night was illegal.  I've fished a bit for walleye after night fall and I found that lights actually hurt the fishing.  I just use lights in the boat for tying knots, unhooking fish, etc etc."

It's been years since I've done it. I've caught them with a few Rapalas (Original, Countdowns and Jointed in the fall) as well as soft plastic jigs + grubs and swimbaits. A few of the locals I've seen, use 3-way rigs with a live minnows on the hook and either pencil lead or a clump of split shot on the dropper.  Wouldn't mind trying it again this summer."
974697,Sinker,2016-06-24 12:55:00,8692,"Yeah, a 3 way rig works good. I like using jigs if its not too snaggy. I like my white berkely power grubs....just lucky with them I guess. 3-4"". Jighead size depends on current. You want to feel bottom, but not be anchored on it.  Husky jerks work good too.....or similar suspending jerk baits."
974705,AKRISONER,2016-06-24 13:04:00,5558,"I would try bombing a rattling rap out as far as possible, letting it sink right to the bottom and then rip it along the bottom."

975135,Dabluz,2016-06-29 06:59:00,701,"If you want to consistently catch walleyes.....down size.  I use 4 lb test clear mono.  I like Berkley Sensation.....it's a copolymer that is very strong.  Do not use any snaps or swivels.....tie directly to your jig.  Do not put plastic on the jig, just the head of a large nightcrawler.  Any colour of jig is good as long as it's black.  I also like marabou feathers on the jig.  Use the lightest jig for the conditions.  VMC makes some great jigs in 1/16 to 1/4 ounce."
975150,Sterling,2016-06-29 14:13:00,477,"I second what Dabluz is saying. Direct tie light line is the way to go.  I however prefer fluorocarbon but I may be splitting hairs at this point.  Try leeches too, they're more durable than worms and seem to work just as good, if not better."

975156,JoshS,2016-06-29 15:35:00,729,"We sometimes stop at a dam or two on the way home after a day on the water. Those fish seem very pressured. Some night there can be 20+ guys fishing a small area. I think you get more bites downsizing if you're using live bait. Also find that throwing different stuff than everyone else helps. If they're super finicky, super light light line, small hook and small minnow works well. A few years ago we caught a lot on the little swimbait, but recently it's tough to get a bite on that bait. The fish get conditioned quick I think. One night there were 10 guys catching nothing and first cast twitching a musky depth raider caught a nice eye followed by another later.. go figure. It's fun to experiment to see what interests them most and what they bite. Often you'll get them to go from staring at your bait to eating it when you go super light line and small hook. I also found moving around will show your baits to new fish that haven't seen a million baits and you can pick up a few more.  As for buying eyes on pigeon, haven't fished it for eyes in awhile. Last time I did a day out there and we got one on the bucktail and a few on the grub pitching weedlines. Last eye I caught on the lake was a 6.9lb on a helidawg!"

974150,crappieperchhunter,2016-06-18 20:05:00,2582,From my experience targeting eyes on Pidgeon....you have to trick them into thinking your fishing for something else. Break out the crappie gear and fish 1/32 jighheads  under a float. While fishing mutter  out loud  just how utterly fantastic it would be to go home with a feed of Gills or crappie.  Eyes have awesome hearing and will feel left out and just smash your offerings.  Works for muskies and bass too. You really just have to trick them into thinking your fishing for a different species.
