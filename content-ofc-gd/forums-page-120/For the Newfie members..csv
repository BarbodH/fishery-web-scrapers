976755,misfish,2016-07-16 16:08:00,29133,"Thanks Bud  That sure brought back some good memories. We would be in the water just tossing/flinging them up on the rock shore and me nan and parents would pick them up. Never used a net or anything, just our bare hands.LOL"
976758,FrankTheRabbit,2016-07-16 16:48:00,479,Been fortunate to have had a chance to hang with some local fellas in Deer Lake who were so accommodating sharing the capelin and boil up experiences. Such a warm and friendly bunch that would add a bright spot to anyone's life. Ive been lucky to visit there twice and hope to add a few more down the road.
976760,Sinker,2016-07-16 17:19:00,8692,We use a cast net and a dip net. Sometimes they stay just off shore so you have to use the cast net. Some guys make throwing the net look easy!

976762,ketchenany,2016-07-16 17:37:00,3229,You would have made a killing with the toon and Terry!
976763,misfish,2016-07-16 17:45:00,29133,You would have made a killing with the toon and Terry!  I would give it a go forsure. Rowing the toon with a net dragging. LOL
