476452,Roy,2010-06-16 18:26:00,13728,"Well then welcome aboard, Mary!"
476453,Terry,2010-06-16 18:27:00,14456,"we do that to all new members, you kept trying till you got it. that is a requirement to show you really really want to be here  welcome aboard.......... oh and I was kidding, glad you stuck it out till it worked"
476460,John,2010-06-16 18:42:00,2956,"Roy only allows females to register and then their husbands/significant others have to go through a lengthy initiation. He will be interviewing this weekend. Bring the Old Milwaukee, it usually shortens the process.  Welcome to purgatory."
476462,shan&jay,2010-06-16 18:47:00,55,"haha, thanks for the welcome everybody...glad to be aboard now"
476463,alexcba,2010-06-16 18:48:00,634,"welcome to the forums..  it took me a few days to get on this board. i even sent an email to the admin. i think its a great idea, this eliminates spam bots, and randoms who will join the forum only to never make a post."
476465,shan&jay,2010-06-16 18:50:00,55,"ya that's what I figured. I wondered if it was also because i tryed to register with the same email a few times. oh well, all's good now"

476483,sleepjigging,2010-06-16 19:38:00,207,"I tried 5 time to register. Unfortunately, in the end, I didn't get the user name that I wanted. Is there a way to change my username?"
476487,alexcba,2010-06-16 19:43:00,634, pm the administrator.
476489,Roy,2010-06-16 19:44:00,13728," Yes, go to your control panel (profile) and change your display name.   Changing your display name will not affect your log in details."
476496,BillsTheBassMan,2010-06-16 19:52:00,932," Finally, ""BillsTheTroutMan""!  Nah, I'll wait until after Bass season for that one.  Welcome to the boards fellas (and Mary is it?).  I trust you'll decide the perseverance was well worth it.  Ryan"
