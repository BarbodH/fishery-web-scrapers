474634,spincast,2010-06-11 00:40:00,3279,"Been there, fished it. Best with a boat - but did not get to try Storm lake which it looked like most of the serious fishers hit. Next time Did catch a 47"" pike  - needed a boat to get there Kids - try the boat launch at the W end of the camp grounds. Big and small mouths, perch and Rock bass Tips. If it looks like it has pike in it probably does. But get out early"

475301,yakpiker,2010-06-13 15:56:00,160,"There's lots of smallmouth bass in the river just below the falls by the town of Restoule.  Toss small spinners with worms into the pads along either side if you have a boat.  There's also a gov't dock there if you're fishing from shore.  Not much size, but the action should keep the kids happy."
