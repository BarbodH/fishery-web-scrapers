Then I clicked on Your name ""Roy"" above your avatar, looked down the left, the center, the right, from left to right and right to left, some more up and down diagonally, made sure I was seeing the whole page and...drumroll...nada..no ""Send me a message"""

476640,wankerjohn123,2010-06-17 01:21:00,117,"Are you on an older computer? Older web browser versions will do that sort of thing sometimes.  Or try logging in on another browser... Eg: Netscape, Safari, Fire fox, Internet Explorer, Opera  Could also be your security settings in preferences depending on which browser you are using.  Or refresh your page.  Hope this helps...  Cheers, John  Sorry Roy/TJ, guess this should be in the ""Computer help"" forum."
