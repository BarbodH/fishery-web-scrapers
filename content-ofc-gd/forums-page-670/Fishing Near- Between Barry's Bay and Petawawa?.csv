Just found out at the last minute I have to run up there and back but figure i might as well do some fishing.  Up for fishing for anything, pickerel, pike whatever, just want to catch some fish...  Bodies of water suggestions are great, not expecting your secret spots or anything.  Thanks...  EDIT:  Was thinking of fishing Round Lake, just between the two because of easy access..."
