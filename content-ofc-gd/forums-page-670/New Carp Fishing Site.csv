475971,TJQ,2010-06-15 15:02:00,7806,"  Just a quick announcement on a new site, I just completed. I've been working with Lawrence Euteneier of BlindFishingBoat.com and Jeff Vaughan of Canadian Carp Club to produce Ontario Carp Fishing  There's a great new Q&A section for anyone who's got questions on how and where to fish for carp. enjoy!!"
475978,MJL,2010-06-15 15:25:00,2427,Great site TJ...Jeff has those St. Lawrence carp dialed in and there's very few people I know who are experienced in carp fishing as he is. I've been fortunate enough to stay at Jeff's place last August and fish with him in one tournament...We'll be fishing together hopefully this September in one tournament down in NY.

476091,MJL,2010-06-15 21:36:00,2427," Hey Steve, here's Jeff's message board.  It's primarily based on fishing the St. Lawrence around Long Sault though. http://www.canadiancarpclub.on.ca/forums/  His articles can also be found here too where he's answered various questions on tackle, rigs, etc http://www.canadiancarpclub.on.ca/forums/viewforum.php?f=4"
