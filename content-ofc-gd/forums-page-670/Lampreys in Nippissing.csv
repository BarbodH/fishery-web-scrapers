476265,vance,2010-06-16 04:52:00,719,We went out from North Bay to the islands tonite for a little fun and on the first fish we caught was a lamprey sucking on a nice size eye.We didn't know these were in Nippissing so it was a bit of a surprise.Needless to say it didn't live long.On a better note we got 11 jumbo perch-5 eyes and an OOS bass.   vance

What you had may have been one of the native lampreys of Ontario, some of which are endangered. I'm guessing it was likely a Silver Lamprey and not (though not impossible) a Sea Lamprey."
