Left Port Hope at 5:30am, weather was overcast and the lake was very calm. Set-up lines at 100FOW not even 5 mins. the dipsey went screaming and landed a nice bow (my first Lake O fish for the season)   then Jet landed another bow from leadcore [  Philip & Jessica both newbies landed their first ever Lake O fish (very exciting)!   biggest fish we got was a 20 lbs chinook landed by Jet   All in all we landed 8 bows (released 2) and 1 chinook   Thanks Lloyd for giving us the opportunity to fish with you, as always it was a great day!"
