476448,fishnsled,2010-06-16 18:15:00,3520,"Safe travels everyone. I believe it was you Spiel that said it takes a week of packing and planning to getaway for a couple of days of fishing or something to that effect. You'd think that you'd have it all figured out by now. Having said that, I better get my:asshat: in gear and start packing as my trip is coming up in a week."
476495,Spiel,2010-06-16 19:50:00,9065,"I had 52 weeks to get ready for this Will and I'm still frantically packing right now (okay I'm taking a breather, but I've more to do). I'd be a great procrastinator if I wasn't always putting it off."
