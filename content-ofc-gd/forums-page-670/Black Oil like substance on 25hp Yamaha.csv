476352,jimmer,2010-06-16 14:18:00,2730,"Just wondering if anyone can give me some insight into where this black oil like substance is coming from and if it is a problem. I have a 25hp Yamaha that is about 5 years old. I have to clean this stuff off the casing between the engine and the lower unit every couple of trips.  It is coming from one of the bolts on the outside of the upper casing.  It looks like some kind of exhaust residue and I have tried tightening the bolt, but it just isn't stopping.  I don't want to overtighten that bolt and risk wrecking the threads.  Any help would be appreciated. Thanks, Jimmer"

476395,jimmer,2010-06-16 16:30:00,2730,It's a short shaft on the proper transom.  The leak is on the lower side of the casing that the cowling attches to.
