475861,LegitFish,2010-06-15 02:10:00,69,"Lol right near parry sound! There was about 5 of them in the one small bay, skimming across the top of the water."
475871,alexcba,2010-06-15 02:28:00,634,"yeah they like to group up, they look cool when they strike too.. go all sideways and stuff"
476168,Guest Johnny Bass,2010-06-16 00:28:00,0,Its always great to catch a new species and gar pike are one of the hardest to catch. Good job!
476213,Bob,2010-06-16 02:05:00,370,First thing you learn is: you're looking at a long nosed gar.  No relation to a pike.  No such animal as gar pike.  There are several different species of gar and the most common in Ontario is the long nose.  They're reported to be more primitive than the pike family but not genetically related at all.  Want to start on pickerel/walleye now?
476244,LegitFish,2010-06-16 03:37:00,69,Really just a Gar? I went home and researched it and most sources on the internet say Gar Pike...? Must be a nickname that everyone just uses.
476252,alexcba,2010-06-16 04:04:00,634,"yeah its just a name.. whether you say ""gar"" or ""gar pike"" most everyone knows your talking about the long nose."
476257,johnl,2010-06-16 04:13:00,197,nice long nose what other species of gar are present in ontario?i've heard spotted but i'm not sure.
476258,alexcba,2010-06-16 04:18:00,634,"i think all we got are the long nose and spotted gar (altho this could be the same fish, i've just heard the reference to spotted before.. i may be wrong as im no expert and the long are the only ones i've caught.. lol wish we had the gator gar here.. imagine hooking into one of those things on a fly rod"
