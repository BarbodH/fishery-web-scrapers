476511,ADB,2010-06-16 20:16:00,444,I need to know which Gerber knife was featured in an ad at the back of the issue.  I'm out and need to know ASAP!  Thanks!
476512,Spiel,2010-06-16 20:20:00,9065,"It is the ""AO F.A.S.T.  3.0""   http://ziprage.com/gear/gerber-ao-fast-30-knife-octane-multitool-reviewed/"
476517,Roy,2010-06-16 20:36:00,13728,We gotta change Spiel's name to Speed.
476518,douG,2010-06-16 20:38:00,2693,"If that knife is spring operated, I think it might be prohibited here in Canadia.  Here is the text: The Canadian Criminal Code defines the switchblade:  ""A knife that has a blade that opens automatically by gravity or centrifugal force or by hand pressure applied to a button, spring or other device in or attached to the handle of the knife."" (sec. (84)(1)()"
476522,Roy,2010-06-16 20:44:00,13728,It's spring assisted. You still have to flip it open. Does that count?
476531,ADB,2010-06-16 21:09:00,444,"Its only assisted opening...it is not a switchblade, and it is not illegal.  You still have to press a button before it opens, it will not just flick open.  Thanks Spiel."
476535,ADB,2010-06-16 21:10:00,444,"Despite the text in the criminal code, ""assisted opening"" knives are legal and are sold at Le Baron, Bass Pro, etc."
476538,ADB,2010-06-16 21:22:00,444,"I'm going to have to repost to clarify...  The reason why ""assisted"" knives are legal is because, generrally, you have to ""start"" them by pushing the blade out at which point the knife does the rest. That is why it is assisted and not automatic."
476556,pikeguy,2010-06-16 21:54:00,195,    The police toke away my knife a few years back. according to him its illegal to carry a knife that you can open with one hand.. I had a butterfly knife
476562,irishfield,2010-06-16 22:05:00,26272,I guess my Leatherman knife is illegal then!  ..oh and my kitchen knife and fillet knife I don't even have to open!  Hell.. even my Zippo knife you can hold the blade lock down and flip the blade out!
476573,pikeguy,2010-06-16 22:32:00,195,ya well i do not know y but i can not find another one!  and all my knifes have a knob like on them that i can open with one hand i don't get it my self ..  im not in enforcement do not know the law on that but i was not about to argue with him gave it to him and i left
476586,Terry,2010-06-16 22:58:00,14456,that's why I carry a hand gun   there is no debate whether it's legal or not  
476588,irishfield,2010-06-16 22:59:00,26272,HAHAHAHAHA
476590,danbouck,2010-06-16 23:10:00,4380,I just got this one    It has a lock and is spring assisted. Can be opened with one hand and is perfectly legal
476603,GBW,2010-06-17 00:00:00,8460,whay that one Dan?  They didn't engrave your name right anyway...
476622,danbouck,2010-06-17 00:46:00,4380," It's very light, has a belt clip and looks cool!  and I might just change my name to Dan Buck"
476744,douG,2010-06-17 12:47:00,2693,"I did some more googling after my post above, and yes, they are legal.  However, my gerber is tuned so that I can open it by sort of waving the handle and giving it a shake.  That likely counts as 'opening automatically ... by centrifugal force'."
