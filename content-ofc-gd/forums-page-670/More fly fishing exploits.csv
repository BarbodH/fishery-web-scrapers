476136,timmeh,2010-06-15 23:28:00,609,"I'm really starting to enjoy fly fishing, to the point that I've haven't brought out the spinning gear, with the exception of a few creeks too small and overgrown to work with my fly rod. I've already been eying up a shorter, lighter rod so I can challenge myself in some of the smaller systems I like to work from time to time. But that will have to wait to next year....  Got out a couple time the past week week and was getting a few smaller fish here and there when hooked into something a little larger. I saw the golden flash and I thought I had my biggest brown yet, but not quite...... After about 30 seconds I knew what was up...   But at least I'm getting my nymphs to the bottom...   Anyway I only had to wait a couple more days to hook into my biggest fish on the fly rod to date. Measured at just a hair under 19"".     I've also picked up an underwater camera and had a chance to play around with it on some of the smaller fish. Future shop has the newer Fuji model on sale if anyone is interested. I'm looking forward to getting a few nicer shots with this camera. Unfortunately these are not so clear as the water was stained from the recent rains.       The troutings been fun but I can't wait to get after some bass on the fly. Soon enough..."

476204,shane,2010-06-16 01:36:00,652,Way to go Timmeh. My best fish on a fly so far is a 12 inch smallmouth. But my goal is to catch a big carp. That should be fun.
476286,fish_finder,2010-06-16 11:36:00,370,Nice trooot man!!  What weight rod are you using right now?
476324,rock34,2010-06-16 13:29:00,215,That is a georgous fish man. Nicely done.   Especially for a new Fish Finder. Congrats
476378,MJL,2010-06-16 15:29:00,2427,Well done Timmeh...Really digging the underwater shots  Is that a 'measure net' you're using?  I'm just wondering if they float on their own with a fish inside as advertised.
476404,BillsTheBassMan,2010-06-16 16:42:00,932,"Man, I wish I was with you when you landed that Carp.  I can just imagine your reaction in the transition from ""big brown"" to ""greasy carp.""  I think I'm going to buy one of those cameras too.  Maybe I'll get an open box special from one of the fellas we know."
476587,timmeh,2010-06-16 22:58:00,609," Right now I'm actually using a 6 weight rod. This was the one decision that I spent a lot of time thinking about. In the end I wanted something that would work for trout but would allow me to cast larger flies for bass as well. While the 6 is a little big for trout it still allowed me to get started. I had always planned that if I enjoyed fly fishing I would buy a lighter rod for trout in the future, and will hopefully do so next season.  MJL, it is a measure net. I wasn't aware they were supposed to float with a fish in so I haven't tried it yet. Maybe I will next time. I really like the net though as it allows you to get a pretty accurate measurement while keeping the fish in the water. No need to pin them down on shore and try to measure a flopping fish. I've found that by keeping them just below the water they actually remain fairly calm, making a measurement much easier.  Thanks for the replies guys."
