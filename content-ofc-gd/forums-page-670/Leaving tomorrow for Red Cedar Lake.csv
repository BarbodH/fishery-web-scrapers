476320,irishfield,2010-06-16 13:24:00,26272,Have fun Gerry ! I'm currently 4+weeks behind.. and it looks like it's gonna be 6!
476327,bridge,2010-06-16 13:32:00,54,I'm heading to Red Cedar tommorow also for the annual trip.  It's a month late for me and the buddies due to whatever.  I'm a black Ranger towing a Sea Nymph.
476356,Gerry,2010-06-16 14:38:00,257,"Wayne, you need to hire some help. Heck Lew isn't doing much these days and he can even put out the fires!  Bridge, where are you staying?"
476470,bridge,2010-06-16 19:14:00,54,"Gerry, we are staying at the ever so luxerious Pozniaks.  I think its our 10th year in a row in the Martin River area.  First two at Beaverland.  Will you be doing any fishn over the weekend?"
476713,Gerry,2010-06-17 09:07:00,257,"Bridge, I probably won't be on the lake until sometime Sunday....gotta get the dock ready, etc.. So you're at the north end of the lake while I'm at the south end."
476716,bridge,2010-06-17 10:16:00,54,I've never even travelled to the south end.  We normally fish the Opeechee area or in the River that Runs down beside the resort.  Not sure if the river will be that easy to fish in this year with the water being low.  Anywho have a fun and do some relaxing after that docks in.
