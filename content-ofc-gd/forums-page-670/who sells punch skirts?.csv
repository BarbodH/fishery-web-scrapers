476006,alexcba,2010-06-15 16:28:00,634,"im going today, i'll let you know."
476017,msp,2010-06-15 17:17:00,1336,bps does not carry them. Gagnons in Shwa carries a punch jig. Its just the head and skirt. You slide your line through and add your choice of hook and trailer. 6.99 tho
476018,Syn,2010-06-15 17:28:00,519,I have a few plastic beads and spare skirts. I was just going to take a dremel to a plastic bead to carve out a groove for the skirt. I wanted to buy them but the price
476019,jace,2010-06-15 17:28:00,472,"catch 'em bait and tackle down in the south end of kitchener has them.  you can buy just one or a handful, they're not pre-packaged.  I haven't been in there since they resized the store but I doubt they would change their inventory too much.   you should call first to be sure."
476029,bdox,2010-06-15 17:52:00,329,"You can find the real Punch Skirts at Fishing World in Hamilton, I was just there and pickings are getting slim, with a couple colors already sold out."

476178,mbac31,2010-06-16 00:43:00,904,"I just picked mine up at Fishingworld in Hamilton. Sorry, I may have bought to many. They also have the Paycheck hooks to match . Cant wait for next weekend. I usually find all that hard to find stuff there as Blake brings it in all the time. This is gonna be a good year for Mats.  They also have the Basstrix swimbaits and the Buckeye Mop Jigs but they wont be there long. I'm going out again this week."
476182,fish-miester,2010-06-16 00:51:00,864,"haha thanks guys, I deal alot with gagnouns so i'll go check them out on an upcoming day! if not I guess I'll just get one of my connections to order me some along with those Ish's phat frogs"
