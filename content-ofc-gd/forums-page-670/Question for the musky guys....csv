475215,JoshS,2010-06-13 03:52:00,729,"I recently picked up a St Croix mojo bass swibait rod, rated 7'9 1-4oz.  How do you guys think this rod hold up for muskies?  I'm mostly casting baits in that weight range and gonna pair it up with a C3 5500."
475225,Garry2Rs,2010-06-13 04:37:00,1425,"As far as I can tell there is no difference between a Swimbait rod and a Musky rod except that Bass guys ""feel better"" knowing it's for Swimbaits not Musky baits...HAHAHA!"
475264,mistaredone,2010-06-13 12:43:00,913,  Your set up is fine.  Id suggest buying a power handle for the C3 it will only run you $15 and will make size 5 blades come in with ease.
475331,houski,2010-06-13 18:33:00,61,"JoshS,  I've got the same setup you just mentioned. I use it mainly for pike and bass fishing. It will do alright for smaller muskie baits. I use mine the odd time for tubes, and downsized spinner baits. However, that being said, I wouldn't consider it a muskie rod.  If you're planning on using it for muskies, I'd spool it up with at least 65 lb. braid."
475340,Pigeontroller,2010-06-13 19:07:00,2793,I picked that rod up in a store and thought...Muskie rod.
475351,bare foot wader,2010-06-13 19:46:00,1354,"I'd consider that rod to be a great multi purpose rod....it kinda sits on the fence/several fences really...heavy bass, pike, light musky....I just wish they weren't purple..."
475488,Sinker,2010-06-14 01:32:00,8692,My go to musky rod is lighter than that if you can believe it.  S.
475504,goteeboy,2010-06-14 02:37:00,175,"i was looking into the same option: using a swimbait rod for musky fishing. So i asked a rod seller on ebay and what he said made sense to me.  Generally speaking swimbait rods are medium action, whereas musky rods have a faster tip.  So swimbaits have a more parabolic bend, the musky rods, bend more at the tip with a stronger backbone. So he says swimbaits can work w/ smaller spinners and even trolling, but wouldn't be good for heavier lures, or for stickbaits or gliders and the like.  Made sense to me. hope it helps."
476248,JoshS,2010-06-16 03:46:00,729,Thanks for the input. I'm going to put it to the test this weekend.
476371,bigbuck,2010-06-16 15:10:00,2449,"Just don't try chucking big musky baits with it or you will end up with a 2 piece rod. As for fighting the fish, it should be fine. Make sure you spool with AT LEAST 50lb braid with a GOOD leader (one that costs $6-15 for just the one). The cheap leaders are just that. Buy good quality tackle, a bit at a time when you have the money. Good luck!"
