475996,BFSC Kevin,2010-06-15 16:12:00,1351," They just told me they don't carry spare parts......... I also inquired on how come the stradic Ci4 didn't come with a spare spool, it was because would raise up the price. The spool alone will cost around $90..."
476002,BFSC Kevin,2010-06-15 16:17:00,1351," Aikmen's didn't have any in stock. Would cost $40 for him to order one. for $100 more, I could buy a whole brand new reel including spare spool. yikes"
476102,BillsTheBassMan,2010-06-15 21:55:00,932," Natural Sports in Kitchener has BINS of spools right now for $2 each, tax included.  They may OR may not have the reel you're looking for.  Who knows, perhaps they'll have one that fits.  It's out of your way, but if you're in the area you could give them a call."
476114,bdox,2010-06-15 22:45:00,329," I'm pretty sure that's the going rate for a Stradic FI spool. Considering the reel is $180 MSRP, that's not a bad price."
