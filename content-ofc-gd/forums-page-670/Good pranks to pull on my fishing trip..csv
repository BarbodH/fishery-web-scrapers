476559,Twocoda,2010-06-16 22:04:00,4130,Derby morning .....shrink wrap the cottage so they cant get out ...i imagine it would work equally as well on a tent or trailer....anything to put the odds in your favour...
476574,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2010-06-16 22:34:00,0,"give him the dreaded ""smelt in a can of beans"" trick.  one has to eat part of the can to unravel the mystery!   not sure if you'll get the chance but if someone has a line set off the dock or something, try a pop can on it.  the ""fight"" of a pop can will fool most anglers into thinking they have a fish. also, while trolling, if you are the driver, pulling your partners line every time he's not looking will annoy him more than most things.  if you do it enough, he won't even believe when he actually has a fish on.  this also works wonders in winter with set lines."

476637,irishfield,2010-06-17 01:13:00,26272, Worst thing that happens there Dan.. they shorten the docks and glue the mooring line to your hand so you can't let go before you fall in the water...

476727,wankerjohn123,2010-06-17 11:24:00,117, Worse thing I would ever do is hide the toilet paper after everyone eats my chili.
476750,Headhunter,2010-06-17 13:13:00,5703,"Un-screw the shower head and insert a cherry flavoured ""Life Saver"" in the socket. Screw the shower head back into place. The Life Saver will allow water to pass through and will disolve at the same time. No evidence and the victim comes out sticky and smelling of cherries! HH"
476313,wankerjohn123,2010-06-16 13:14:00,117,Bug spray on the lures...check. Ex-Lax in the chili......check. Hide the toilet paper....check.  Come on... give me your best ones.

476358,Toddyc20,2010-06-16 14:41:00,141,"This won't work in the summer but a few years ago there was a large group of us guys ice fishing.  One of the guys cooked up some chicken wings so when i went into the cabin to have some food they all pulled up my line and tied on a lobster.  Then one of the guys came running into the cabin saying ""Todd you got one on your line, look at the bend on your rod!"".  I ran out, reeled it in and stood there with the most dumbfounded look on my face.  I've never been so confused and boy was it funny."
476359,oxcowboy,2010-06-16 14:42:00,544,"Ok just how bad to you want to get this guy?  we have had many a pranks over the years, the best one was sending a picture to the local paper and writing up a man seeking man want add   It didnt go out to the public, but he didnt know that. we put one in our cabin, in the main lodge and gave a copy to all the other cabins. He was so pissed that he wouldnt even get out of the truck when we went to town because he was afraid someone would recognize him.  here is how it went:  My name is Matt. I am a fun loving guy from Ohio ! I am looking for the companionship of an Outgoing, Strong yet Gentle Guy with lots of stamina where it counts, lol. I enjoy long walks along the river, cuddling up to a warm fire with marshmallow's and hot cocoa or just relaxing while playing my favorite Barry Manilow and Barbara Streisand CDs. I’d love to try some o’ that ‘Canadian Bacon’, I’ll bring the Syrup! Are you that Special Guy I’m lookin’ for ? I’ll be in the area at the end of July. Cum and find me !  It also had a altered picture of him wearing lipstick and waxed eyebrows.  To this day the idiot still thinks it was circulated throughout the community.  We have also stuffed a road kill partridge under a buddies boat seat, fed one guy exlax for 3 days straight,cut a hole in the bottom of their net, cabin raided at 4 in the morning stopped to pee on rocks in the middle of the lake and left them, we put up a big poster on our friends cabin saying Welcome Haliburton chapter of she-males annual outing. etc....  Have fun with it,   jason"

476364,Muskieman,2010-06-16 14:46:00,2472,"Get a severed rubber hand or foot and fake a wood-splitting accident... Carefully placed bees-nest in the outhouse?? Change his spinnin' reel handle from L/R .. strip all the line off and reel it in backwards. Change his ball-cap size while sleeping and take all of his socks..re-size his lifejacket   Here's a good one. #1.Tie a fake squirrel to a piece of fishing line 10"" or so long. #2.Get Thumbtack and attach to loose end of fishing line #3.Attach contraption to inside of cupboard door. #4.Place fake squirrel inside of cupboard and shut door. #5.Set up video camera. #6.Ask fishin' buddy to get you a cup from the cupboard. #7.Watch and listen to your buddy scream like a school-girl after the squirrel jumps out at him. #8.  :rofl2: #9. **  be sure that buddy has taken the joke well before attempting #8  Have fun...

476370,Harrison,2010-06-16 15:09:00,2202,"On a boys fishing weekend a guy was getting on my nerves. He had jeans on that were all frayed at the bottom, so I lite them on fire at the campfire. To get his revenge he put fish guts on the exhaust manifold of my truck.  It was a 2 hour 4x4 out, turns out, I was lead truck and the smell was worse behind me.  Kids eh!"
476372,fish-miester,2010-06-16 15:11:00,864,oxcowboy thats hilarious! ugh this makes me want to go on a fishin trip even more haha even tho its already enough entertainment without the pranks!  but I am liking the idea of cut then re-spool there line idea!

476393,Tom McCutcheon,2010-06-16 16:25:00,627,After all the sandwiches have been made for lunch for everyone just swap out plain bread for the meat and cheese ones in your pals lunch bag.
476419,MJL,2010-06-16 17:07:00,2427,"For guys with waders, I’d stick worms and maggots into the inner chest pocket (unzipped) before my friends put them on...They’d eventually crawl out to explore.  Also works well with spiders, millipedes that you can catch.  The fuzzy caterpillars you find climbing trees work the best.  Drop a few skein or gooey roe bags into your buddy’s waders before he puts them on.  Remove the chapstick from the tube, replace with a mix of cork grease and chili pepper.  On one camping/fishing trip, one friend pranked a bunch of us and filmed it with the movie mode on his camera.  On the way home, one guy had his laptop in the car, removed the vids and uploaded some questionable material onto the SD card…It made for an interesting slide show when he sat down with his family to view it all on his big screen TV.  Epoxy the cap of one bottle of beer in place (you can drink it first and fill it with something else) and give it to the guy you like the least that day.  When my friends were sleeping in their tent, I'd throw some peanuts (for squirrels & chipmunks into the tent, wait for the cavalry to arrive and zip the tent shut.  Wait for the screams   .  Also works really well throwing corn if ducks, geese and swans are around."
