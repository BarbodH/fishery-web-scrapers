476689,irishfield,2010-06-17 03:10:00,26272,"If you are going to spend any time on Georgian Bay.. do yourself a favour and just buy the complete chart book for the area. Mine is the Lake Huron edition of Richardson's (including Georgian Bay and the North Channel).. from 20+ years ago.. not sure if they're still around or not, but I can guarantee the same rocks are still out there!!"
476694,camillj,2010-06-17 03:58:00,1988,but the water levels are just a wee bit lower than I remember in the old days
476755,Zamboni,2010-06-17 13:32:00,235," Few years ago I scanned all these charts, files are in printable page size good to bring on a boat instead of taking the chart. Pm me an email and I'll send you the files for that area."
