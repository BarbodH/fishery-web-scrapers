476138,wankerjohn123,2010-06-15 23:36:00,117," You print the temporary one as soon as your done. Mail, it takes a couple weeks.     "
476139,medmart,2010-06-15 23:37:00,587,When you pass the test you can print a license off the computer then they will send you the card in the mail
476140,alexcba,2010-06-15 23:37:00,634," hey brian.. you most likely didn't do it years ago cause it wasn't required for smaller vessels. im sure its the standard 3-6 weeks the ontario gvmt says, so expect it in about 4 months lol.."
476142,lookinforwalleye,2010-06-15 23:39:00,4399,"You can print a temp card after the test, I think it took a couple of weeks to get the card in the mail."

476281,TroutnMuskieHunter,2010-06-16 10:53:00,1362," Hey Brian,  If you haven't done the test yet, send me a pm. I have a $20 discount coupon/code for you if you use BoaterExam.com"
476497,lookinforwalleye,2010-06-16 19:56:00,4399," You don`t have to read anything if you don`t want to just go to the boater exam at Bass Pro if it`s still there they basically give you the answers. I think they could care less if you know anything, IMHO they just want your money.  Somebody is getting rich on this deal!!!"
476615,Brian,2010-06-17 00:28:00,33,"Thanks everyone for the info!  TnMHunter thanks for your offer but I was not patient enough. lol  All good to go now.  Thanks again all.  OFC does it again  Thanks,  Brian"
476661,Rizzo,2010-06-17 01:46:00,4754,"if doing it on-line I think you need a qualified ""supervisor""...can be your friend...but it takes a bit of time to sign that person up too"
