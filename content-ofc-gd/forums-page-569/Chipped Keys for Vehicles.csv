556291,Fishnwire,2011-02-28 14:31:00,983,"I didn't get a spare when I bought my Jeep second-hand.  The dealership has them, but like everything else, they want an arm and a leg for them.  Does anyone know if you can order them online?  I know I'd still have to get it programmed at the dealership but I was hoping to avoid their ridiculous mark-up on the blank itself.  The other thing I'd consider is having the electronics that recognize the chip removed and bypassed so that any properly cut key will work in the ignition.  Perhaps it can be programmed out in the vehicleâ€™s computer?  Can anyone shed any light on the feasibility of doing such a thing?  Thanks."
556303,bubbles,2011-02-28 14:55:00,591,"I'd like to know the same thing, hopefully someone can shed some light."
556311,mercman,2011-02-28 15:07:00,7054,"checked a few places here locally, speed glass and some of the other detail shops, and they say no. It has to be programmed for your car by the dealer. Security reasons.  "
556322,BITEME,2011-02-28 15:39:00,1968,"You can buy them on line blank Had to do this for the wifes Liberty  You need 2, lots of instruction on line how to program them get them for about 14 dollars, 112 to get them at dealership its easy to do its just turning the ignition on and off  you need the one you have plus 2 more once you program the new keys stash the original you need this one or you will not be able to program anymore keys you cant copy of a copy  Peter"
556323,bassjnkie,2011-02-28 15:43:00,1101,"I bought mine for under $20 on eBay. It comes with instructions for programming, took me under 1 min to program. To bypass the chip, you can sacrifice a key and attach it close to the ignition switch, this is what i did to my last car."
556333,danbouck,2011-02-28 16:06:00,4380,I get spares for the work vehicles at a local shop. They did the chipped ones no problem for around $40
556341,Terry,2011-02-28 16:21:00,14456,ebay is a great place to buy them cheap
556343,Bernie,2011-02-28 16:33:00,3190,The locksmith in North Bay does them. Perhaps your local locksmith can do them as well.
556356,gaspumper,2011-02-28 17:02:00,393,"I have a Buick Lasabre and had the security system overrid,now I can start it with an ordinary key."
556360,Billy Bob,2011-02-28 17:16:00,5865, You can have  ordinary keys made from your original then just tape the original chipped key underneath the dash close to the ignition (this will override the security system) and you're good to go if you want to save a few bucks.
556367,Bernie,2011-02-28 17:29:00,3190, Not necessarily true Billy Bob. Depends on the system.
556369,Billy Bob,2011-02-28 17:40:00,5865, You're probably right but definitely worth a try.....
556401,cityfisher,2011-02-28 19:27:00,959,"im in the same boat with my 04 Jeep GC, lost my spare set now im stuck with one set. I wanted to get another made but the dealer wanted 150 for the key alone !!  I looked into it online and found i need 2 keys to program a 3rd. If you only have one key your pretty much screwed  like me  lol"
556623,Fish Farmer,2011-03-01 12:55:00,2234,"$300.00 for a Dodge Charge key, I've been all over the place trying to get one. They told me it's a dealer item. If you find one other than the dealer, chances it can't be programed, your wasting your money."
556626,bubbles,2011-03-01 13:05:00,591,"I'm in the same boat, need 2 keys to program for the Expedition. Man I hope I don't lose the key......then again I can probably replace the entire ignition system for the price of the keys!"
556662,taper,2011-03-01 14:36:00,611,"Just a note if your thinking of taping a key near the switch and using a non chipped key, if a thief tries to steal your vehicle you are making his life a lot easier by bypassing the anti-theft device.Also as was already stated this wont work on all systems."
556729,Billy Bob,2011-03-01 18:07:00,5865, But at the price of $3 to have a non-chip key made isn't it worth the gamble....BTW they can steal the car either way and some cars need to be stolen...
557058,pikehunter,2011-03-02 12:21:00,1659,When I bought the Ford in October the salesman told me a chipped key cost about $72. But I didn't actually inquire with the parts desk. Guess if he was right then that dealer is offering a deal at that price.
557140,ohhenrygsr,2011-03-02 16:52:00,947,I've seen Canadian Tire have a display about chipped keys and they tell you what kind of chip it is and all.
