557411,buckster,2011-03-03 03:31:00,530,"Looking to get a chip for my HDS unit for this spring/summer.  I do most of my fishing on the kawarthas/simcoe.   G bay, nipissing, rigging on lake O and possibly erie.   If anyone can recommend a chip that might suit my needs it will be greatly appreciated...  I have no experience with any of these chips"

I chose the Platinum Lake Maps because it had a few neat features that I'll never use. It covers 1700 lakes including 1000 high def lakes (not Nipissing though).  I think is was about $180."
