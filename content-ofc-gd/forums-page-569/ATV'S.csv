556568,2advanced,2011-03-01 03:36:00,53,Is it legal to ride with two people on a one seater?  Are there any ways to covert a one seater?
556600,Big Cliff,2011-03-01 09:48:00,6899,No & No.  That said however things seem to be changing and I wouldn't be surprised to see it being allowed in the not too distant future.
556629,Woodsman,2011-03-01 13:10:00,1286,Rear seats can be bought. As for legal to use them it depends. Anywhere the Highway traffic Act applies it is illegal. Where the Off Road Vehicle Act applies it is not prohibited.
556696,2advanced,2011-03-01 16:08:00,53,So. Is it legal to convert a single seat snowmobile?
556704,2advanced,2011-03-01 16:23:00,53,Okay no wait what I read was the highway traffic act :s  So if I was riding on the lake would I be ticketed with having a passenger?  Can I go on the trails with a passenger?
556705,Tom McCutcheon,2011-03-01 16:27:00,627," I don't think it would be legal. The thing that makes the TWO UPs semi legal is the longer wheel base. A regular ATV with a ""tool box"" seat on the short wheel base makes it top heavy over the rear wheels and a danger to flipping over backwards if you are not careful.  I don't know about a snowmobile. Probably similar technicalities.  Tom."
556786,2advanced,2011-03-01 20:46:00,53,I called the ministry to finalize to make sure - yes it isnt illegal to have a passanger off-road but it must be safe for both a sled or atv.  its really on the discretion of the officer again like everything else! it took 3 phone calls to find this out.  like pulling teeth
556813,Woodsman,2011-03-01 21:40:00,1286,There is no legislation in place in Ontario currently that recognizes 2-up ATV's even exist. No charges under the ORVA exist either for more than one passenger. The only reference in the ORVA to more than one rider states they must be wearing an approved helmet.
