556069,bigugli,2011-02-27 20:54:00,6138,It was a great day out there for my first time out. Was fishing with Governator and friend. Nice to make the acquaintances. No white stripe for us. Too bad the whitie grounds were just a bit too far for this body Good to see a number of good folk again. Even better to meet many for the first time. My mother's happy too. We brought home enough perch for her and a couple of church friends to have a perch lunch this week.  More brownie points for me

After many, many years of attending this fine fundraiser, I actually won biggest fish this year        What a great turnout this year turned out to be.  So many people I haven't seen in awhile and lots of new people I met.  Really nice seeing all of you today!!  Paul and I joined Terry and Lloyd at our usual haunt and that was a good decision.  Lloyd's stepdaughter thought so too.  Here is a video of her and her big laker  Love the coaching going on by Lloyd!!    There's so many pics, I'm just going to post them with no comment.  Enjoy!  Oh, and Paul actually caught fish                                                Joey"
