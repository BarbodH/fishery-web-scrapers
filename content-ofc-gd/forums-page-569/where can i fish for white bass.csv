557436,Bob Devine,2011-03-03 05:50:00,251,There is a really good bite on the Detroit River in mid May after the walleye run. You can jig or cast to the feeding schools lots of fun.
557440,dave524,2011-03-03 10:41:00,4508,"There seems to be a spring run also in the Niagara River. I've got a few good size ones offshore trolling for yellow pickeral on Lake Erie in the summer, I think they would be hard to target other than the known spring runs as probably the schools seems to suspend offshore in deep water during the summer."
557447,BIG JIM,2011-03-03 13:04:00,11," We had some in the hawg trough at the Ottawa Show last weekend but I couldn't get a bite...stupid fish!!!  I have caught them in some areas of the Great Lakes, a few in the St. Lawrence River and in some portions of the Ottawa River also...never really hit em'  really good in these areas with the exception of the upper portion of the Ottawa River and even then it was just a fluke, wasn't really looking for them.  Fun to catch, decent eating, try using crappie sized lures or maybe just a bit bigger.  I actually have them in a little lake near my house...not supposed to be there but they are and can be a hoot.  As for ther season???check with your local MNR office to be sure about your area.  BIG JIM"
557450,Rod Caster,2011-03-03 13:17:00,5784,"Caught a few tiny ones in nipissing along the waterfront shores.  Apparently they can be found in some rivers off Nipissing in the spring. Up our way, there is no season or limit."
557453,Mike01,2011-03-03 13:26:00,378,"I have caught a few in Callander Bay(Nipissing) in the spring while fishing for walleye.  I have never seen them over a pound though, I'd say down South would be your best bet."
557458,fishing n autograph,2011-03-03 13:41:00,2540,any pier on erie during the summer....last time i fished in Leamington i had a field day and must have caught and released 30 or so
557459,Harrison,2011-03-03 13:45:00,2202,"Lake Ontario, not as many as in the past, however still a few kicking around.  We get them incidentally fishing for browns and smallies."
557465,uglyfish,2011-03-03 14:12:00,981,Grand river below the dunnville dam. Mid may to mid june usually sees a good run in there. Lots of very good quality fish and big numbers.
557468,bubbles,2011-03-03 14:14:00,591,"Yep, lake erie and Detroit river are loaded with them.  As Bob said above late May it's rediculous, great time to bring kids out, bite is constant."
557492,bassman87,2011-03-03 15:17:00,586,Nanticoke near the outflow if you;re still allowed to fish there. White Mr. Twisters = Crack Cocaine for them.
