Thanks to the expert guidance of a friend who knows his way around out there, I iced this beauty 25.5"" eye.  Hit a live minnow on a green jig that was next to me while I jigged an orange chubby darter.  Quite possibly the largest fish I've ever pulled through the ice....definitely the biggest eye    I would have a much lengthier report about my travels the following day to Trout Creek and surrounding area....but it was a bit of a skunk-fest....so it's best left undisclosed"
