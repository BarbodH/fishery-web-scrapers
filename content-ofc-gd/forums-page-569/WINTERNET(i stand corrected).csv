556560,mercman,2011-03-01 03:09:00,7054, Hey !!!! Thats my Auntie Norman you're laffin at man !!!!
556833,mercman,2011-03-01 22:03:00,7054, Thanks TJ !!! Just trying to relieve the stress for some in here.Theres lots of itchy casting hands in here right now.
556848,HTHM,2011-03-01 22:54:00,4082,"Well, I gotta say you got some of us scratching, our heads, that is..."
556863,mercman,2011-03-01 23:25:00,7054,"  Not to worry Albert, i'm probably saner than some.You should know that. Just harmless ventin thats all."
556179,mercman,2011-02-28 02:52:00,7054,"Last fall, i heard some of you 'OLE Timers' speak about something called winterlude.I thought you were talking about some kind of celibration of winter or something. I mean, i've never spent the winter in here with you guys before.Sometime in December i figured it out.  Its like cabin fever only worse.Its taking a couple of hundred more or less strangers and sticking them in a room for 6 months with no place to go, and all of them telling the same story of their favorite passion, fishing in our cases.After a few weeks, maybe a month, we have all told our stories of the summer before, and now search frantically for something to talk about,just so we dont lose touch with one another  What would happen if......... Weekly funnies(getting more risque by the day).... Did ya hear the one about.... Kill the cormorants..... Drinking on the ice..... Mines the best screw the rest....................... Broken tackle and bad service................. People going through the ice............ the price of gas................... mines bigger,longer,smaller,lighter,more flexible,...and did i tell you mines the best... locked threads, deleted posts,bump...... weird PM's.......................  I've learned alot too. I have learned that i can be sarcastic,funny, serious,ridiculous, entertaining,helpful,generous,excited,aloof,caring,uncaring,offensive. I also learned so can all of you.  I have learned that i like some of you, and that i dont like some of you.I have learned that some of you like me, and some of you dont. Thats part of the big picture, and i live with it, the same way you live with it.We are a cross section of all races and religions.  I also learned that we are basically all the same, no matter how we like to come accross in here.We have had different experiences through out our lives, but we are all made of the same stuff.  But mostly i have learned that at its worst, this is a pretty kewl place to be, and at its best, its unbeatable!!!!!!!!!!!!!  And once Winterlude is over, i shall be saddened. Because softwater will be back, and lots of us will be on the water instead of cooped up inside, sitting here in out pajamas,boxers,jogging pants,fruit of the looms, and yes...some of you even in negligees, camisoles and bras,beating the keyboards with the story of our lives, and how much we miss being in the boat, by the lake,in the streams,on the rivers,at the cottage,in a tent, FISHING !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  LIVE LONG AND PROSPER  Paul"
556182,Dozer,2011-02-28 02:57:00,896,Thats... interesting
556187,fishing n autograph,2011-02-28 03:00:00,2540,Merc you're awesome! (I'd use emoticons but i can't figure it out with my blackberry)
556189,mercman,2011-02-28 03:02:00,7054,  We are all awesome buddy !!!!!! Thats what we are all about
556214,HTHM,2011-02-28 05:12:00,4082,"Have you been drinking?????   That is a well thought out, cogent and eloquent piece of writing.   Well worth exploring as a board. In short, you seem to be suffering from winternet as well."
556216,ChrisK,2011-02-28 10:02:00,2772,"I think the word is ""winternet"" if I'm not mistaken"
556222,Billy Bob,2011-02-28 11:19:00,5865,
556224,mercman,2011-02-28 11:49:00,7054,  Too Much CoCo and Cookies i guess.
556225,solopaddler,2011-02-28 11:54:00,8605,There's definitely some truth to that.
556238,bigugli,2011-02-28 12:53:00,6138,True hard water anglers don't suffer from winternet.
556247,Rod Caster,2011-02-28 13:10:00,5784,  +1. I couldn't be happier this time of year.  The fishing rarely stops due to weather. Enjoy living in your own heads guys.
556248,skeeter,2011-02-28 13:10:00,1907,"...some of you even in negligees, camisoles and bras.  Dont even think about turning your web cam on....."
556249,fishing n autograph,2011-02-28 13:12:00,2540, I think I just threw up in my mouth a little....
556252,NAW,2011-02-28 13:16:00,4022,  I fall into that catagory..
556254,Billy Bob,2011-02-28 13:26:00,5865, When you're young ice fishing is a snap....hopefully as you age you wouldn't suffer from ailments that prevent ice fishing from being a pleasant experience.
556259,Rod Caster,2011-02-28 13:37:00,5784," Ice fishing is way easier than sitting in a boat. You can sit, walk, lay, sleep, stretch...it's all there. I suppose the cold can be killer on joints or arthritis however."
556263,Leecher,2011-02-28 13:44:00,7832,But we do Bruce.... a little   at the beginning of the season while waiting for safe ice
556267,limeyangler,2011-02-28 13:48:00,5204,    jacques....what would we do without you  
556272,Leecher,2011-02-28 13:54:00,7832, I don't know Simon    could be worse
556273,mercman,2011-02-28 14:03:00,7054," Just a little ????? Me, a lot.... .The image of Skeeter in a negligee is burnt into my brain matter forever"
556275,TJQ,2011-02-28 14:03:00,7806," I, for one, shall not be saddened...   Dats da trute brudder!! Like a Saturday morning hangover... lol very debilitating and my age.  Great post Merc, when people realize some of your comments, they are finally part of the community. The good, the bad, and the ugly."
556281,Guest gbfisher,2011-02-28 14:12:00,0,  It's a syndrome that some suffer every year. The only true remedy is to............... GO FISH!
556304,mercman,2011-02-28 14:56:00,7054,"I cant even watch WFN!!!!!!! I start sweating like a race horse, and droolin like Cujo !!!!! My dogs are hiding their ears with their paws even"
556321,Billy Bob,2011-02-28 15:37:00,5865, If you mean getting a ride out to a heated hut...then yes that's easier but 99% of my ice fishing when I was younger was me pulling a light plastic sled with my hand auger and buckets in tow. Sometimes walking close to 2 miles out and enduring the cold.
556328,Rod Caster,2011-02-28 15:58:00,5784,"  Fair enough...snow trekking is NOT easy, especially when hauling out all that gear."
