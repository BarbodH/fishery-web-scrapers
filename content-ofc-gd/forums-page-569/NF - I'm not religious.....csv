555923,The Urban Fisherman,2011-02-27 14:45:00,2050,"See you guys are beyond awesome!  Definitely helped to read through your stories that ended well and to have so many positive outlooks.  Everything you read online seems to point to a negative outcome... not a good thing to google this sort of stuff.  I'm currently burying myself in house and office work to sort of take my mind off it a little and to make sure we have everything taken care of and in order before Tuesday.  We have a fair bit of stuff to get done before then as we weren't expecting the little one so soon.  I was trying to get my basement finished and my new office up and running so Claira could take over my current office and would have a nursery, but apparently she's impatient just like her mom...  I will get back to you guys individually as soon as time permits.  Thank you once again OFC - this place truly is one of a kind.  Thanks again and have a great sunday afternoon!  Ryan and Family"
555925,JohnF,2011-02-27 14:51:00,3494,You'll have lots of support here Ryan.  Keep the faith.  JF

556175,fishing n autograph,2011-02-28 02:41:00,2540,Best and most sincere thoughts going out from my family!
556228,Tarzan's Jane,2011-02-28 12:08:00,1183,Hi Ryan  I haven't been on OFC for weeks (on a course)...anyway....this morning with the crazy weather I drove myself in a little earlier....and decided to take a peek here.  Baby Claira is lonesome.  She hears you all and she wants to join her family.  All will be well.  And I will be praying for her and thinking of you all including your Grandmother.
556241,The Urban Fisherman,2011-02-28 12:58:00,2050,"Thanks guys! Nanny's in the hospital right now, just waiting to hear how everything goes... we have a bunch of stuff to finish off and get sorted and ready before tomorrow.  All of your thoughts and time that you put into sending us PM's and stories of happy endings are priceless and very much appreciated.  Thanks!  Ryan & Family"

557338,Handlebarz,2011-03-03 00:12:00,3790,Dang Ryan I missed this over the weekend as I was not on the puter but thought something was up when reading the follow up post I am truly glad to know the outcome of this.  Thoughts are still heading your way for your Grand mother
557345,irishfield,2011-03-03 00:25:00,26272,"You know my thoughts Ryan, as we talked before I left.... and you know the story of our ""lost baby"" that is currently doing her Masters in Architecture at Waterloo.  Hope all went well yesterday and all are doing FINE !  Wayne"
557349,Pikeslayer,2011-03-03 00:38:00,1443," Ryan, If anything/everything I googled/read on line was true, I wouldn't be here today to reply to your post. Stay positive & strong for your loved ones. Good things happen to good strong people. God Bless, Simon/Slayer"
555633,The Urban Fisherman,2011-02-26 15:50:00,2050,"With the excitement and hopes that the gang does well at the Tyler event this weekend I hate to start something up that's on a lower note, but I could use some positive reinforcement or energy sent my way right about now.  I typically try to keep personal things in my life detached from OFC as although I do consider very many of you my friends, even some whom I've never met, at the end of the day this is still a public forum.  The board has done huge things for me such as hook me up with Dave Mercer... that lead to the job I have now, which allows me to provide for my family. Also, for the past two years my Fish-a-Thon has been a huge success largely thanks for the folks of OFC.  For this I thank you guys more than you can imagine, but I need one more favor.  We have a new baby girl who was due to arrive in our lives sometime next month, and up until Thursday everything was going smoothly.  Ginny went in for an ultrasound and to the doctor's shock Baby Claira hadn't gained the weight they expected.  The only reason they did the ultrasound was because she was breach a few months ago.  Now although she isn't breach anymore, she's under weight and they're concerned that something is wrong, so they're going to induce early labor and get her out on Tuesday.  The doc's are going to have a special care unit in the room on standby in case they need to rush her out and take care of her.  There's a good chance that she'll be just fine, but the doc's have to tell us the worst case scenerio's as well.  I don't really know where I'm going with this....It's just been tough to concentrate the past couple of days.  My wife is doing better since finding out and we're optimistic that everything will be a-ok but if anybody has been though something like this and has positive feedback please feel free to throw it my way.  I've already spoken privately to one member who's helped me think positive about all of this.  I'm scared, but hopeful and excited to meet my baby girl on Tuesday.  To top it all off my grandmother ""Nanny"" has since gone in for a routine checkup and they ""found something"".  So they scheduled emergency surgery for monday morning, where they plan to remove said ""something"" and do a biopsy on it.  If all goes well she'll be in the hospital for 5 days then released, and hopefully said growth isn't something to worry about in the future.  Unfortunately I won't be able to visit her as I'll be 6 hours away in the hospital with Ginny and Claira.  Anyways - I've had better days, and am looking forward to getting the next few days over with.  High hopes and lot's of love to my family is all I'm concentrating on right now.  And I guess a little venting on OFC.  As for my favor.. if you took the time to read my ramblings and maybe think about us for a few seconds...thanks  Many of you are enjoying the ice - but I'm only a month away from soft water fishing on Erie   .  Until then - fishing is taking a back seat.  Cheers and Thanks for reading.  Ryan, Ginny, Averie, Luke and Baby Claira"

Hope all goes well on Tuesday Jacques"
555686,Roy,2011-02-26 18:42:00,13728,"Hey Ryan, some couples try to have children and can't. You and Ginny have been blessed so far there's no reason why it wouldn't continue.  I've got 5 children, the last one, Helene was born at 24 weeks...that was 29 years ago on the 20th of January. She weighed 1.5 pounds. Considered almost a lost cause back then at that age. This was at the Royal Victoria Hospital in Montreal. My wife and I were at the hospital til Helene was able to leave. I slept there for 2 months. There were a lot of other children in the same neo-natal care unit and lots didn't make it for a bunch of reasons. The biggest reason I think was that some parents would just visit the child once in a while for 30 minutes or and hour. You have to stay with them! Put the gown on, stick your hands in the incubator, touch them and talk to them. Sounds suckie I know but I believe that. I can speak volumes on this stuff but this is not the place to do it.  Good luck to you and Ginny."
