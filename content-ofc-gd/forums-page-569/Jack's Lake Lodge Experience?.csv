557032,adempsey,2011-03-02 05:29:00,1498,"Nope, but I have stayed here: http://www.millerstimbersands.com/  if you need an alternative.  I thought it was called Jacks Lake Lodge though"
557069,jediangler,2011-03-02 13:26:00,1923,Never stayed at Jack's but I have had great experiences with Miller's Timber Sands.
557077,kuhaman,2011-03-02 13:58:00,503,Stayed there a couple years ago. The owners were very nice and the cottages were located about 30 feet from the lake. The fishing was awesome.
557103,saspirilli,2011-03-02 15:26:00,27,"I was also looking at Miller's, but they only do full week rentals.  Jacks Lake Lodge is willing to rent for a weekend, but the website is pretty barren and out of date and it was hard to tell if the place is in good shape.  Wanted to make sure the place was in good order before placing a booking!"
