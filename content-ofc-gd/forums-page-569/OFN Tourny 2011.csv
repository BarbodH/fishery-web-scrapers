550650,drewbrew,2011-02-12 13:00:00,31,"Hey im in for Joining,Sign me up!"
550751,manitoubass2,2011-02-12 17:34:00,11391,"  Awesome, go down to the tournament sign up forum and put your name in!!!!"
550801,mike rousseau,2011-02-12 20:03:00,4661,What is this tournament ??? And how do I sign up?
550818,manitoubass2,2011-02-12 20:53:00,11391," It's a multi species tourny for board members. Sign up in the tournament forum and you'll get added to a team of OFC members. Read through the rules etc to get a clearer idea of how it all works, but its very simple.  Sign up, I'm still waiting myself to get added to a team  follow this link to sing up NOW!!! http://www.ofncommunity.com/forums/index.php?showtopic=50035"
551148,manitoubass2,2011-02-13 18:32:00,11391,"Bump.  Come on guys, get signed up for the OFC tourney! Gonna be a blast!"
551562,Governator,2011-02-14 22:02:00,879,"Giving this a healthy bump.  If you haven't signed up yet, you'll regret it later.  We just need a few more.  Join here: http://www.ofncommunity.com/forums/index.php?showtopic=50035"
551572,mike rousseau,2011-02-14 22:21:00,4661,Might be a stupid question but what do we do for the tournament... I mean I read the rule but what's the goal here... And how do we register fish?
551588,Leecher,2011-02-14 23:18:00,7832," There's never a stupid question, only stupid answers    it's for bragging rights... nothing more   I think you should read the rules again   it's all explained in black and white"
551595,mike rousseau,2011-02-14 23:39:00,4661,So length is everything then... Ok
551604,Leecher,2011-02-15 00:02:00,7832," Yep  Edited to say:  any fish you catch for your team that is not already submitted counts.  Where it gets interesting is when you have to beat a certain length for a species already caught, which in my mind makes it challenging and fun"
551613,mercman,2011-02-15 00:39:00,7054,"  Yup, so we can all say 'Mine's bigger than yours"""
551614,GBW,2011-02-15 00:43:00,8460,"""But we've got the biggest fish of them all"""
551615,mike rousseau,2011-02-15 00:43:00,4661,Well you can count me in for a 30 inch walleye a musky pushing 50inches and a pig if a carp!  Bring on the competition boy and girls
551616,Rich Clemens,2011-02-15 00:43:00,3131,"So then what happens - when the ladies submit their entries, and they're so much bigger ?"
551617,mike rousseau,2011-02-15 00:49:00,4661,May happen... My gf has some PBs that would challenge most OFC members
551619,irishfield,2011-02-15 00:55:00,26272,  Always love to see guys jinxing themselves for the season...
551620,mike rousseau,2011-02-15 00:59:00,4661,I'm on the mighty st Lawrence... Trophy fish is what I do... Lol...
