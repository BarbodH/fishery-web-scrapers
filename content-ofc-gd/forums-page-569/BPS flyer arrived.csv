556855,skeeter,2011-03-01 23:09:00,1907,you can also save this in your favorites.  http://toronto.flyerland.ca/
556859,SRT8 smoker craft,2011-03-01 23:19:00,1107,They have papers and pencils just inside the door to sign up for the flyer.
556861,Cudz,2011-03-01 23:23:00,2652,Sale looks ok.  With a reel trade in a new curado will run you as little as $149.97.  Not bad.
556866,BillM,2011-03-01 23:28:00,17367,"Brian, you want a used float reel anyhow.   Best bang for the buck out there."
556870,Cudz,2011-03-01 23:32:00,2652,I was hoping live target lures were going be on sale but alas it seems that is not to be.
556875,adempsey,2011-03-01 23:48:00,1498,"  I thought they were....or maybe that was the past flyer??   I know I saw the frogs on sale in the flyer that goes to March 10th [or perhaps it's an intro price?] and they have an end display of these lures.  Anyway, are you referring to a new flyer or the one that goes to March 10th?????  Oh, one thing I was wondering is that since the US sale is before the Canadian one people knew in advance about the really good door crashers that weren't even published.  I was at the store the day they had the HDS5s for a crazy price and was wondering how all those people even knew about it.  Well, I guess they all had US friends?? =)  Anyway, anyone have any inside information they'd like to share?!?!?!"
557026,Cudz,2011-03-02 04:27:00,2652,I am talking abou tthe new flyer that came today.  Sale starts on the 11th.  Last year they had a gps finder unit as a door crasher for like $250 or something like that but hey did not have the numbers or something was messed up so they gave away HDS5s for that price!!!
557047,misfish,2011-03-02 10:28:00,29133, Ya ok. You stopping by for that exchange.
