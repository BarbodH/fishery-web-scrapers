556256,Old Man,2011-02-28 13:31:00,822,"It never ceases to amaze me at how little sense of self preservation some people have.  The federal government advises Canadians to avoid all travel to Afghanistan, calling the situation in the Middle Eastern country “volatile and unpredictable” and adding that the threat to Canadians from terrorist violence is very high.  “Canadians undertaking travel despite this warning take serious risks,” Foreign Affairs’ travel report warns.

556284,solopaddler,2011-02-28 14:18:00,8605,My guess is no one goes to Afghanistan on holliday.  There's probably more going on here that we'll never know.
556338,DRIFTER_016,2011-02-28 16:14:00,10439," You're right, but I just got back from a lovely 3 week vacation in Somalia with a stop in Libia on the way."
556339,wallyboss,2011-02-28 16:14:00,1095,Wonder if the Taliban man is that naive????
556495,ehg,2011-03-01 00:23:00,2666,"I think you are right, Solo. This guy wasn't on 'vacation'. Now he has some big problems"
556496,BillM,2011-03-01 00:26:00,17367,This guy should be on the Darwin Awards list.
556499,Grimace,2011-03-01 00:32:00,2020,"I think he may have been some kind of wannabe journalist or something.  Anyways whatever his deal is, I would not want his fate."
556521,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2011-03-01 01:39:00,0,"i've heard there's some great ""all inclusives"" to be had in libya right now."
556526,Tybo,2011-03-01 01:46:00,1373,"Yeah tourist.Yeah that's right, a tourist. I wonder what this guy looks like. Think he has blonde hair and blue eyes."
556528,Grimace,2011-03-01 01:48:00,2020,His bloodlines are half Chinese half Scottish.  What he looks like doesn't make any difference.
556539,bigbuck,2011-03-01 02:05:00,2449,"This guy is a complete moron!! I feel sorry for his family and for the poor taxpayer. His family will probably have to pay an undisclosed sum for his release (if they don't skin him first) and External Affairs will have to pay staffers who knows how much to deal with this. I'm being a bit coldhearted but I don't suffer fools and this guy certainly qualifies. Who in their right mind goes to a war zone who doesn't have any business there (soldiers, media, mercenaries (oops, I meant private contracters), and the like)."
556801,POLLIWOGG,2011-03-01 21:20:00,835,"Google tourism in Afghanistan, you might be surprised.  But it must be almost as dangerous as Mexico or Toronto during the G20."
