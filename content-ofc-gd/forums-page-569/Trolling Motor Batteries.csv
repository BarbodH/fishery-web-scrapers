556602,Ricky Bobby,2011-03-01 10:12:00,35,"hey All. Picking up my new boat in a couple of short weeks (shake n bake!) and I will need to replace the trolling motor batteries. I have used energizers in the past, as well as the blue topped ones from Canadian Tire (no clue on the name)  Anyone have any other preferred batteries they use? I have an onboard charger in the boat already, so just the batteries get changed out.  Shake n bake!"
556603,Roy,2011-03-01 10:19:00,13728,The Energizers are still a good value at Wal-Mart. I use 2 GRP 27s for the 24v with an onboard charger and they're solid.
556611,scugpg,2011-03-01 11:36:00,1373,Top end I'd recommend the Optima batteries paired with a CTEK charger.  If you're looking for a conventional value battery its hard to beat the Walmart or Costco deep cycles.
556613,Ricky Bobby,2011-03-01 12:14:00,35,Where does one get the optima batteries?
556616,SlowPoke,2011-03-01 12:43:00,2984,"Walmart & Costco have them as well as most battery suppliers. They're expensive at $200+ each reg. price. I'll give a nod to the CTEK charger as well. Even if you have an onboard charger, the CTEK is recommended by Optima and can be had for $80 full price at Canadian Tire. CTEK also sells attachments that can make it as convenient as an onboard charger."
556617,Billy Bob,2011-03-01 12:44:00,5865," I don't know where you reside but Optima batteries are VERY expensive even down here at Sam's Club....PLUS you need a special charger to properly maintain them. They run about $150 to $180 compared to $69 for standard batteries (Sam's Club)...some guys swear by them, others swear at them because they claim no better then a standard battery at twice the price.  Bob"
556624,SRT8 smoker craft,2011-03-01 13:01:00,1107,The energizer batteries are no more at walmart the are now called everstart but are the same thing I beleive they are IMO the best bang for the buck at around $100 and they last a long time. if your TM is a 36v than your looking at $300ish +tax for everstart or $700ish + tax for optimas
556627,skeeter,2011-03-01 13:09:00,1907,i just bought an energizer battery for my truck last friday at walmart. the manufactered sticker on it was 01/11.
556630,jediangler,2011-03-01 13:11:00,1923,01/11 = November 2001   .
556638,SRT8 smoker craft,2011-03-01 13:34:00,1107,Just looked yesterday and my local walmart had no energizer at all only everstart they were at the Toronto show mabye your wallyworld still has a few left pretty sure they are just re-labelling them the look exactly the same other than the labels anyone know the whole story gonna google it right now .
556644,lew,2011-03-01 13:46:00,12766,I'm using a pair of Walleye 1 deep cycles on my boat and their excellent batteries. My last boat had a Walleye 1 cranking battery that lasted 8 years.
556645,SRT8 smoker craft,2011-03-01 13:49:00,1107,Google didn't come up with much
556658,taper,2011-03-01 14:32:00,611,I had the walleye batteries in my boat that Lew recommended they lived very well.
556668,Sinker,2011-03-01 14:49:00,8692,"I have also had great luck with Walleye-1 Batteries. I run two together for a 12V TM, and I can't seem to kill them. I use my TM for slow trolling too.  S."
556671,SRT8 smoker craft,2011-03-01 15:04:00,1107,One thing I have found out that the same company that makes optima's make the everstart also they are made by Johnson control Inc. and the everstart are sold only at walmart .
556676,Roy,2011-03-01 15:22:00,13728,Everstart is a private label. There are only a few battery manufacturers the other names you see on them are private labeling. Walleye 1 for example is a label by Crown Batteries of Ohio.
556678,Roy,2011-03-01 15:32:00,13728,Here's the poop on who makes what. It's been recently updated.  http://www.batteryfaq.org/
556683,SRT8 smoker craft,2011-03-01 15:38:00,1107,Thanks Roy I have never really been concerned with this stuff just was looking because I was tolkd energizer was no more at wally world and skeeter just bought one so I was intereted to find out but there's not much out there that I could find.
556689,lookinforwalleye,2011-03-01 15:52:00,4399,"I have had good luck with most batteries, the only battery I had that failed was a BPS branded battery. Current batteries being used are Deka Marine master for starting and Interstate Mega Tron`s for trolling and they both perform flawlessly."
556699,perchslayer666,2011-03-01 16:12:00,280,"The Walleye batteries are great, price wise they're $120-$160 ish range, but they are worth the money for a battery with longevity.  I personally bought a costco house brand (Kirkland) deep cycle for my trolling motor for like $80 all in, and it seems to hold a charge well, and have never drained it fully after a couple days out on the water. If you are looking for a good economical battery, check this may be a good option.  I also have a energizer deep cycle battery I bought at Walmart, and it's a great battery for the price as well, when they came out a couple years ago they were like $70 for a 800 amp size I believe."
556702,Fisherman,2011-03-01 16:19:00,7201,"1. Like it mentioned above there are only a handful of companies that physically make the battery, they are just sold with different stickers on them.  2. Optima batteries are way overated, check the actual capacity vs. size. vs price and you will see. 3. Go to a place like Total Battery that sells a lot of batteries otherwise you end up with old stock.  Batteries that sit around for more than 3 months without a maintenance charge even if brand new start to sulfate. Do a google search on it.  CTEK chargers are very good for off season maintenace charging, however, the smaller ones can't recharge a big battery very effectively."
556723,Billy Bob,2011-03-01 17:57:00,5865,As already mentioned most batteries are a like with only the price being the big difference (assuming size to size and spec to spec)....If you intend on doing a lot of traveling with the boat then get a battery that is available throughout your fishing range in case it fails under warranty. Also always keep the battery receipt with the boat.  Bob
556746,Thrasher,2011-03-01 18:40:00,39,"I've used the energizer & Trojans. A couple years ago, was told aboput Total Battery, boith the name of the store, and the battery. Bought one, and will not buy anything else again. Compare them, you'll be glad you did. 16.5 lund, 46 lb minn kota, troll for walleye, using 4-7 power, and can troll for 6-7 non stop hours, and still have plenty of juice. My brother 21' nitro, 65 lb thrust 24 v system, can't kill the batteries in a day of tournament fishing."
556805,jjcanoe,2011-03-01 21:23:00,744,"Crown Battery Makes the Walleye 1 Battery, although it's under a different brand name now Crown Battery  If you live in the Toronto or Montreal area check them out, they are a great TM battery,  I've got a pair (24V 48# TM) 4 years old and they still last a full week at the cottage  CTEK is an amzazing charger for the price, especially if you cach them on sale at CTC for 40% off  jjcanoe"
