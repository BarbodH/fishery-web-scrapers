555957,craigdritchie,2011-02-27 16:05:00,1586,Reason for stocking Atlantics is well known - to guarantee federal funding for lamprey control.

555981,Grimace,2011-02-27 17:12:00,2020,Thanks for the heads up.  You failed to mention what time it starts.  My guess would be 7 if it is on a week night.  I am lucky to get home by 7 and I am an hour and a half from there.  I will however be heading to the lake Ontario salmon and trout symposium in Mississauga.  At least that is on a Saturday.  In early April if I remember correctly.  Edit.  Correcting stupid iPhones auto correct.  Lol

556106,Spiel,2011-02-27 22:38:00,9065,"Dan, certainly you can't believe that everyone on this forum would be onside with the topic of the aforementioned meeting?  It's bound to raise opinions both pro and con and I'd have hoped you'd have been prepared for that?"
556109,Terry,2011-02-27 22:45:00,14456,it always surprises me when people are upset that people are giving their opinion on a discussion forum  maybe it could have been put in announcements and locked
556201,fishdawg,2011-02-28 03:22:00,912,"the problem with relevant fishing posts being moved to ""announcements"" is that they dont get the same amount of views as ""which snowblower should i buy?"" "
