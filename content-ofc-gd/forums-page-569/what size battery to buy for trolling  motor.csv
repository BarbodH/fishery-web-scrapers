556756,skinny,2011-03-01 19:08:00,442,After reading the thread about what brand of battery it reminded me I should pick up a new one. Now the trolling motor I curently have is a 35lb thrust (I think). I have plans to replace it to some time this summer. But I have always had isuues with the batery I use going flat. I bought i deep cycle Nataulis from CTC last year and it is better but I can still kill it. I'm now pushing a 16ft starceaft tinner with the trolling motor. I have at least one event this year that will be all day on the trolling motor. I do not want to run out of battery part way through the fish a thon. I also want to stop carrying extra batteries just incase.  so how do I know what size of battery to buy to hopefully solve this issue
556765,SRT8 smoker craft,2011-03-01 19:31:00,1107,Skinny your TM is to small for your boat so it will take a lot of juice to run it if your CTC battery is 1 year old take it in and have it tested if it is OK and your still killing it your gonna have to upgrade the TM I have had a 40lb on a 14' and it was not enough I would go with a 55lb on a 16' atleast but you will get days worth of use with a 24v 65lb TM it will be a bit more $$$ but it will save you a tonne of hassle if thats not in the cards get the strongest battery you can afford look at Roys link from the other thread.  http://www.batteryfaq.org/
556775,skinny,2011-03-01 19:52:00,442,upgrading is on paper just not sure if it's in the wallet. hoping to get on full time where I'm working and out of the temp (pimp) service I'm with.
556776,SRT8 smoker craft,2011-03-01 19:56:00,1107,I hear ya did the temp thing for along time make sure ya look at BPS spring flyer usually have a few TM's on sale .
557039,Bondar,2011-03-02 07:39:00,817,you need a larger group size of battery with  a high reserve capacity we use the Deka batteries from lebarons and havent had a problem with them yet
557093,bigbuck,2011-03-02 14:50:00,2449,"Get the bigget one you can find. With that small a TM on a 16ft'r, it's on high most of the time and will suck juice outta the battery hard. You really need at least a 55lb."
557134,Sinker,2011-03-02 16:35:00,8692,"You can also connect two batteries together, and still run 12V to your TM. It will last much, much longer that way. I run mine like that too.  S."
557139,Billy Bob,2011-03-02 16:46:00,5865,"What group size battery are you using now.....24, 27, 29 or 31...I would recommend at least a Group 27 size battery. I have one in my boat and my old trolling motor was a 28# thrust....got me through everyday and sometimes through a weekend but I don't have it on constantly. I now have a 40# thrust TM also with a 27 Group size battery and never have a battery problem. But if you are constantly on the TM maybe upgrade to a 29 or 31 battery...but they are BIGGER and HEAVIER.  Bob"
557160,DRIFTER_016,2011-03-02 17:31:00,10439,"Definately go with a group 27 or larger. I have an 80# 24V unit running on 2 group 27's.  Almost forgot, I have had good luck with the CT Nautilus batteries. My last set lasted 6 years. Just remember to recharge at the end of the day. Leaving a battery 1/2 charged is a sure fire way to decrease it's life."
