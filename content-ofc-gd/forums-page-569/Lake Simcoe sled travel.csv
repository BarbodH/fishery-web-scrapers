554937,12footspringbok,2011-02-24 01:56:00,459, Should have done that instead of poking holes in the running boards... but the set was given to me...and one broke in half third run... welding a new tip on tommorrow
554999,fishhunter,2011-02-24 12:27:00,604,Well with the snow we are getting and going to get travel will be great.
555086,misfish,2011-02-24 17:03:00,29133, What snow? Not snowing here. +2.
555201,BillM,2011-02-24 22:40:00,17367,"Yup, not even a dusting up here in Barrie."
555211,Sinker,2011-02-24 23:08:00,8692,A bottle of dish soap will get you out and back in a pinch. Just lube up the sliders once in a while on your travels. Works mint.  S.
557309,Terry,2011-03-02 22:57:00,14456,"found my video of my scratchers  <embed width=""600"" height=""361"" type=""application/x-shockwave-flash"" allowFullscreen=""true"" allowNetworking=""all"" wmode=""transparent"" src=""http://static.photobucket.com/player.swf"" flashvars=""file=http%3A%2F%2Fvid25.photobucket.com%2Falbums%2Fc52%2FMrbeee1954%2FDIGI0007.mp4"">  I think we might need them for our trip this weekend"
557320,FishAbout,2011-03-02 23:26:00,106,Don't follow close behind someone with them.  Mine work well also.
557385,irishfield,2011-03-03 02:14:00,26272,You won't need them Terry... but you'll have to run tight to the North Shoreline if you want anything you own to survive!
557391,Terry,2011-03-03 02:37:00,14456, ah..where and why??????????????????????//   as great concern sets in....................
557395,irishfield,2011-03-03 02:48:00,26272,"Hard bare frozen lake.. now with drifts from 80K winds yesterday.... and lots of hard frozen slush troughs from when folks were getting around back during the melt down that flash froze one night. Only smooth running (and even it has drifts now) is sticking within 20 feet of the North Shoreline, and I mean right from town to the hub. Like I told Lloyd.. hug my point of land on the way out (not the camp.. the 26 acre point).. right around the tip of it, around behind the cottage off the point and run the shoreline. Once you get close to the brooms (just after Axe Narrows) stay to the right and run up between the island rows again sticking tight to the North shore (well it will be the south shore of the islands.. lol) and after the brooms just keep staying against that shore. Into the hub.. tight to shore and go behind Ketcheneny Lodge... don't head for the ice road. It's a longer route hugging the shore... but it's quicker and your gear might stay in one piece getting up to Kokoko."
557397,Joey,2011-03-03 02:52:00,9122," Uhhhhhhhhhhhhhh, I'll just follow Terry"
557400,irishfield,2011-03-03 02:58:00,26272,You might even be smart to go behind our island and the next one up as well.. going out and coming back. Nice and smooth back there..
554592,dheitzner,2011-02-23 12:23:00,314,"Just wondering how the conditions are for sled travel out on Simcoe.  Thinking of hitting the East side tomorrow, think there is enough snow on the ice to keep the sliders cool? Thanks, Darcy"
554666,Joey,2011-02-23 15:35:00,9122,"No, its touch and go.  Ours were smoking!"
554669,misfish,2011-02-23 15:40:00,29133,"I cant see the vid link here,so I have to do the whole thing.  Calling for snow Thursday,not much though.   http://www.ofncommunity.com/forums/index.php?showtopic=51182"
554727,skeeter,2011-02-23 18:06:00,1907,"Lots of bare ice, minimal snow drifts.  get a set of ice scratchers and put them on your sled."
554729,fishhunter,2011-02-23 18:23:00,604,I ran 18 miles both sunday and monday with no probems. I also have ice scratchers on my sled but monday did not need them.
554731,Pikeslayer,2011-02-23 18:31:00,1443," Hey Dann, How's the sled running? You just got it out of the shop last week??"
554807,dheitzner,2011-02-23 21:25:00,314,"Thanks fellas, I think I'll look into some scratchers. Darcy"
554811,Fisherman,2011-02-23 21:37:00,7201,"Buy scratchers..   Got a couple of leaf rakes standing around idle, cut off the handles and red/green tape them to the inboard side of the skis, if we can't find you handsome, at least we can find ya handy.  Or something like that.."
554824,BillM,2011-02-23 22:02:00,17367,"So um, being a snowmobile rube, where should I look for the smoke?  lol"
554827,irishfield,2011-02-23 22:08:00,26272,Track running against the plastic sliders Bill... overheats if it doesn't get some snow in on them. Drive thru any snow you can or get some scratchers.. or make some. The bolt thru the ski tail worked well for me last year.. until I lost them somewhere..  Something to be said for the old full boggie wheel track of yesteryear..
554829,BillM,2011-02-23 22:10:00,17367,"Gotcha Wayne, appreciate the info bud!"
554886,skeeter,2011-02-24 00:38:00,1907," Yes , and running good!    wouldnt that catch on the bed of the trailer while loading and unloading?"
554890,Terry,2011-02-24 00:48:00,14456,"you have to remove them before loading same with store bought scratchers, you must lift them most scratchers you can't go in reverse too"
554892,irishfield,2011-02-24 00:50:00,26272,Correct Dann.. and why I lost one of my bolts. Slipped in thru the bottom of the ski..with washers stacked the correct thickness and a quick pin on top. Pin popped.. bolt gone!
554900,BillM,2011-02-24 01:13:00,17367,"So you are 'scratching' the ice where the ski's are to cool the track?  Am I getting this right?  I don't wanna know how hot my sled got the other day out on Simcoe, no smoke though so I guess that's a good thing, lol."
554903,irishfield,2011-02-24 01:15:00,26272,"Google Snowmobile ice scratchers.. I thought I had a picture of what I had done, but I don't. Terry has real ones both on his sled nose and track sides. Main idea is to get a dusting of ice chips/snow into the track area to cool the sliders.  ** I think Terry runs the ones on the nose because his is liquid cooled to get some dust up into the cooling tunnel. Not needed for air cooled machines."
554909,BillM,2011-02-24 01:23:00,17367,"Wayne, would I still need them with a studded track?  I'd think that would kick up enough ice to cool things down no?  I'm a complete snowmobile rube if you haven't figured it out yet"
554912,irishfield,2011-02-24 01:24:00,26272,"Don't know Bill.. wouldn't think much of that would make it's way onto the inside of the track.. but there might be enough ""dust"" going up and around and falling down thru the track holes."
554915,BillM,2011-02-24 01:27:00,17367,Well the bolt trick seems like a simple way to keep things cooled down back there.  I'll look into it.
554916,12footspringbok,2011-02-24 01:28:00,459,"Yes you still need them with a studded track. There are many different types you can buy, and if your seeing smoke its probably too late. Last year i wondered what the red crap on my snowflap was when i was out one day... red slider being shaved off. Your track lug height makes a huge difference on how much snow gets up on the track clips.  This reminds me i have to do some ice scratcher fixing tomorrow..."
554918,Terry,2011-02-24 01:31:00,14456,"I have 3 sets on my skidoo  bolts for the skis  SLIDEKICKS ice scratchers which I have on the inside of the skis <iframe title=""YouTube video player"" width=""480"" height=""390"" src=""http://www.youtube.com/embed/iFoEKVV5SNs"" frameborder=""0"" allowfullscreen></iframe>  and regular scrstchers on the rail "
554922,12footspringbok,2011-02-24 01:35:00,459,Do the bolts through the skis not make it a bugger to turn and fight with the carbide runners?
554925,BillM,2011-02-24 01:41:00,17367,"Man, I'd forget to put those scratchers up one single time while going into reverse and they'd be toast, lol."
554926,irishfield,2011-02-24 01:42:00,26272,Bolts.. don't even know they're there.
