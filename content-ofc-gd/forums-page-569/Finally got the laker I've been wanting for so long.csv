554709,MCTFisher9120,2011-02-23 16:53:00,3761,"Congrads man, I didn't get mine this year, wont be on trout waters again until next time around.  Thanks for sharing,  MTBF"
554713,Jet,2011-02-23 17:04:00,364,"I was probably as happy as you were when I heard the good news! You really persevered after nearly two seasons of very hard work and it will pay off in more ways than just this. Now that you got the ""feel"" I look forward to the next report this time on the TS2!  Awesome work."
554721,craigdritchie,2011-02-23 17:40:00,1586,Pretty fishie. Love lakers.
554746,misfish,2011-02-23 19:12:00,29133,Nice fish congrats.  I now know what I can use my old lunch cooler for.

554569,frozen-fire,2011-02-23 06:18:00,542,"This was trip number 12 that I've been on the hunt to get one of these things! I have got a number of smaller lakers, but was looking for something that actually had some weight I have hooked a couple bigger ones that got off and lost one right at the hole before, but have never had one in my hands. I was beginning to lose hope, but finally....iced a decent laker.  This one is for you jet. Thanks for the inspiring advice!  You may miss the laker fishing through the ice here, but we're all jealous of your west coast scenery/fishing.  I don't think I've ever wanted a fish so bad.   Felt amazing to finally get one.   Perfect wild specimen. Had to go back. Barely fit through the 6"" hole. Had to force the head/belly through.   Didn't take long for it to start kicking.   Soaked on release as it powered off. See you next year    Can't wait for more."
554573,ChrisK,2011-02-23 10:11:00,2772,"Congads,nice fish FF. Glad to see you finally got your big laker and nice pictures too !!  Cheers"
554575,kingofthesteelhead,2011-02-23 10:50:00,140,Nice pictures.Looks like me as I use a 5 inch auger and sometimes a bit dicey getting them through the hole!
554581,asdve23rveavwa,2011-02-23 11:47:00,2690,Beautiful pics of a beauty laker!!  Congrats
554587,Hoppy,2011-02-23 12:00:00,95,"Nice fish, keep on fishing."

554596,Jacob,2011-02-23 12:39:00,186,Nice fish  Hard work always pays off
554616,alphaalpha,2011-02-23 13:35:00,475,Great work on a nice laker!   I am kinda in the same boat waiting to get my first laker still.  Got out 4 times last year but didn't have any electronics.  This year i have a finder but have only been out once (I can definitely tell the finder will make all the difference after watching a few follows and getting a couple bites).  Hopefully on my next outing i will land one
554617,limeyangler,2011-02-23 13:37:00,5204,"LOL...awesome report....6"" auger going for trophy lakers to catch n release...brave man...well done.  You need to tell MJL what you caught that on....he was telling me in chat last night he is on a similar quest at the moment.  thanks for sharing"
554621,MJL,2011-02-23 13:45:00,2427," Simon, I already know what he caught that fish on...I gave him that tube a few weeks ago on our last trip out  ...So technically speaking, that's my fish and I ""caught"" it"
554624,Leecher,2011-02-23 13:49:00,7832,Sweet reward for your efforts frozen-fire Well done and congrats Leechman
554637,Victor,2011-02-23 14:15:00,1609,"  That's right lol, he can't claim that fish to be his.  We were actually fishing side by side haha. All day he hasn't been seeing very many fish and I see the odd one every now and then so I told him to come to my holes.  I drilled that hole for him, he was using my fishfinder lol. AND he was jigging like 10 ft above me, the fish shot up from bottom, obviously thinking that mine was a good meal. I'm sure that if the fish didn't come up to inspect my lure he wouldn't have gone for Ant's tube haha.  So, in conclusion. I'd say I have 30% of that fish, Mike's got another 30%, and Jet's also got 30%. Pats on the backs guys, we got our simcoe laker for the year"
554643,crappieperchhunter,2011-02-23 14:37:00,2582,Great report and photos   Congrats and thx for sharing.
554645,Grimace,2011-02-23 14:46:00,2020,What a beauty.  Way to go.
554649,frozen-fire,2011-02-23 14:53:00,542,More lakers! Even bigger ones!  Keep going at it. Finder makes a huge difference. I don't think I can go laker fishing without one. Have to see where the fish are and how they're reacting to your offering/presentation.  You two are stealing my glory!
554650,Rod Caster,2011-02-23 14:55:00,5784,"You son of a .....  I spent 12 hrs on the ice yesterday , with 6 inch holes looking for the SAME THING. My buddy got two decent ones, but nothing like yours. Lake trout actively avoid me, I'm convinced of it.  My jealousy enrages me... in a good way hahaha.    nice job!!!!"
554653,MJL,2011-02-23 15:04:00,2427, No...It was 99.999% me...And I'm being modest  It was my special amino acid and pheromone impregnated tube that I gave him that did it...Just like my uber top secret roe of mass destruction  The question remains...Did you get a double Big Mac with an apple pie after?
554654,frozen-fire,2011-02-23 15:06:00,542," I was convinced that lake trout would know I was fishing and would tell all other fish around not to take MY offering. Last year, I was fishing with Jet... he almost had a double digit day...all nice sized lakers. Even though I was fishing so close to him using the same thing, I ended up with nothing. It's so depressing!  It also seriously sucks when you go out on so many outings, go home sulking...log onto OFC, and see reports from so many members on how they slammed the fish LOL. I make myself feel better by saying they all have sleds and go to the middle of the lake while I can only go out on foot."
554655,frozen-fire,2011-02-23 15:10:00,542," No...with the long awaited success, it was indeed time for a change. Got a Crispy Chicken Sandwich! They actually messed up my order and gave me the same sandwich that Vic ordered. I originally wanted to try the Southwest Chicken Sandwich."
554662,danc,2011-02-23 15:22:00,4677,That's a beauty. Congrats!
554665,Joey,2011-02-23 15:33:00,9122,Great feeling eh  She sure it a beauty too.  Well done.
554670,Dutchy,2011-02-23 15:40:00,416,Nice looking fish. Congrats
554671,irishfield,2011-02-23 15:44:00,26272,Great stuff!!! (Note - start drilling bigger holes!)
554680,limeyangler,2011-02-23 16:00:00,5204,  Mike...i hope you aint been using that stuff of yours from the freezer as attractant!
554683,frozen-fire,2011-02-23 16:02:00,542," I have an 8"" finbore III that I normally use. It was Victor that drilled the 6"" for me  You think there are any lake trout around that would have problems fitting up an 8"" hole?"
