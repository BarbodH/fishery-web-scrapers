Unfortunately, I had to miss the Fishing For Tyler event on Saturday but I hear it was a great turnout and I'm glad to see the event not only going strong, but growing strong.  I managed to sneak out for a few hours in the afternoon but I should have stayed home.  Went 0/2 and must have put 20 miles on the sled. I was supposed to meet a friend this morning at 7am, but when my alarm went off this morning only a couple hours after getting home from watching UFC 127, I wasnt exactly feeling it.  After a hot drink, i felt up to the challenge and I departed.  We met up at BBP and took the sled for a ride.  Not many people around at the first waypoint so we set up shop and never moved.  We could only fish until 1230 so we had to make the most of our day.  It was 820 before we were set up out there and within 5 minutes I had a fat humpback on the ice, it was a bleeder so he's going to the smoker.  Over the next 4 hours, we experienced our best day in a while out there!  With such a tough February season, it was nice to end it with a bang! Final tally was 15 lakers and 2 whities landed.  Cal lost probably the biggest laker I've seen personally on Simcoe.  He got it up to about 10 feet where we got a good glimpse of it before peeling right back down to bottom where the fish popped out on a headshake.  I put that fish at 20-25 pounds, it was so devastating, and talk about a broken record for this season.  Got the fish on a variety of baits although the Stinger and a smoke/purple slammer did most of the damage today.      "
