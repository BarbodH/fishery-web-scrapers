557375,alphaalpha,2011-03-03 01:54:00,475,My buddy and I are heading out of oro tomorrow but probably won't be hitting the lake til about 9:30 or maybe a bit later.  Unfortunately it is only a two-man hut so no room to all fish together.  Feel free to pop by and say hi if you see us though.  I will be the one in the green snowboarding gear (plaid type pants) and blue plaid/fur hat dragging my clam 5600 on a homemade ski rig.   -Alphaalpha (Adam).
