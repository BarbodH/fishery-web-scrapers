It seemed so unusual, that the management of both teams got together and decided that there should be some sort of competition between the two teams because of their great rivalry. So, they decided on a weeklong ice fishing competition. The team that catches the most fish at the end of the week wins.   So on a cold northern Ontario lake they began their contest.  The first day after 8 hours of fishing the Canadiens had caught 100 fish and the Leafs had 0.   At the end of the 2nd day the Canadiens had caught 200 fish and the Leafs 0.   That evening the Leafs coach got his team together and said, ""I suspect some kind of cheating is taking place"", So the next morning he dressed one of his players in Canadien colors and sent him over to their camp to act as a spy.   At the end of the day he came back to report to the coach. The coach asked ""Well, how about it, are they cheating?""   ""They sure are,"" the player reported, ""They're cutting holes in the ice""."
