556825,kickingfrog,2011-03-01 21:53:00,8333,I think the camera man kicked the rod in.
556842,PikeMolester,2011-03-01 22:36:00,428,laughed when I saw it on WFN last wednesday...I also thought the camera man was going to fall in. At first I thought he kicked it in himself. I think had he not had the camera he would have been dedicated enough to dive in and catch it right in the first 2 seconds. AND heaven forbid I have to lay my rod down for emergency purposes with line or fish in the water I just leave the bail open
556851,GBW,2011-03-01 23:01:00,8460,"Here's what Big Jim had to say about it on Facebook, LOL! "
557082,BIG JIM,2011-03-02 14:19:00,11,"  Hey Guy's, what you saw is exactly the way it happened...I am still having nightmares over the whole event...had just caught a 34 inch walleye on that outfit with a Shad Rap #9 the day before and I was tearing em' up, in fact a picture on the cover of Just Fishing's new issue is of that fish.  It was either a musky or pike that snatched MY PEANUT WALLEYE it as it went out of the boat like a missile...as we all saw.  We did spend about an hour with musky outfits spooled with 100lb. Power Pro and open fish stringers which we had to buy in town...caught all sorts of good STUFF...but no freakin LOOMIS RODS WITH CHRONARCH'S on them...well at least I know where there is more LOOMIS RODS AND SHIMANO REELS.  I was on a tear up there, but Dave kicked my ass that day...as soon as he left my tear continued????  Was a great week up there which we dubbed ""WALLEYE PALLOOZA 2010""...MERCER, IZUMI, ME, HOCKLEY, MAHONEY, MACMURRY, ALLARD, JACKSON, MAZUCCA, and more...  The price of youtube??? OBVIOUS!!!!  Going out to the garage to cry some more...  ENJOY!!!!  BIG JIM..."
557088,DoubleDigits,2011-03-02 14:34:00,140,I would like to have seen Big Jim do this...from an Aussie show I used to watch 
557130,LeXXington,2011-03-02 16:18:00,1928,"HHAHA, I think everyone of us has done that at least once."
557131,mercman,2011-03-02 16:23:00,7054, Priceless !!! The wife threw her rod in last year while casting.35' of murky St Lawerence river water. May it rest in peace......
557132,solopaddler,2011-03-02 16:31:00,8605,  Nice to see you chime in Jim. It was pretty obvious you were pissed.
557135,Billy Bob,2011-03-02 16:38:00,5865,IF you haven't lost a rod or two in the lake you haven't done much fishing...
557138,Spiel,2011-03-02 16:43:00,9065," Sorry, I politely disagree. I've never lost a rod into anybody of water and I've done plenty of fishing. Off the roof of my vehicle, well that's a different story."
557147,mercman,2011-03-02 17:05:00,7054,"  beat ya....never lost a rod Period. Stepped on a few though I watch some of the shows, and they have rods all over the deck.That would make me crazy, plus probably put me in the poor house.    Paul"
557165,BIG JIM,2011-03-02 17:57:00,11,"  No doubt I was pissed man...probably 75 walleye's in the boat over two days before Dave arrived and not one got off...that rod works and I only had one there...my only memory of the trip is the 34 inch behemoth, at least that's my story and I'm sticking to it.  I was more upset at losing the Shad Rap #9...every once in a while you get a hard bait that just works better than the rest...that was one of them for sure.  Take Care  BIG JIM~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~out'"
557166,BIG JIM,2011-03-02 18:02:00,11, Years ago during an O.V. PRO BASS event on Tri Lakes I had the unfortunate event to bump a stump with the electric go over the front just as a fish hit my Moss Boss(wonder if they still make em')...I landed in the pads and never missed a stroke of the reel handle...2 3/4 pounder rounded out the limit...only thing that would have made the whole thing better is it would have been a five or six.  BIG JIM>>>>>>>>>
557169,solopaddler,2011-03-02 18:15:00,8605,  You should have dove in after it.  That would've topped Bill Dance's bloopers any day of the week and twice on Sunday.
557173,Roy,2011-03-02 18:20:00,13728," Funny stuff after the fact but not too humourous as it's happening. One of my favourite surface baits was the Moss Boss especially because of its simplicity and ease of use. My go to pattern was the black scale. And yes, Heddon still makes them and they are usually available on special at $3.99"
557178,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2011-03-02 18:35:00,0,"  I think I've told this story before but here goes....  The photo above is of a PB smallie I caught a few summers ago.  I quickly removed the hook after this photo, then held up the brute for a photo. My rod with small grub was left dangling over the side of the boat, tail barely touching the water.  Just as we took the next photo a second smaller bass, about 3lb grabbed the jig at boatside and hauled my wife's brand new pflueger/berkley over the side of the boat.  It was hard to be mad about it considering the fish I had just caught, but my father in law and I decided to try and catch the rod.  I tied on a large spoon while my father in law tied on a large treble hook will a large bell sinker dangling from one of the hook points...  We systematically dragged the 10ft depths for five minutes before my father in laws rod started to bounce...  ""I think i got it"" he said.  But as he pulled it next to the jon boat we both gasped ""It's a PIKE""...  The fish were in such a frenzy that day that the 6lb gator had actually hit the hook and sinker...  I didn't get the rod back, but I sure did get a great story.  You can actually see the rod hanging over the side of the boat just before it disappeared... "

556637,SRT8 smoker craft,2011-03-01 13:29:00,1107,"""He took the rod"" LOL Ryan just about lost the camera to save the rod he's pretty quick almost    like"
556641,I'mHooked,2011-03-01 13:44:00,525,    
556642,Joey,2011-03-01 13:44:00,9122,DOH!  I hate when that happens!!
556652,skeeter,2011-03-01 14:15:00,1907,"That was Funny. He looked like he was going to cry""That was my favorite rod"".  Now if that was my rod it would not be funny! The funny part would be me diving in after it."
556673,tb4me,2011-03-01 15:09:00,3295,"Oh man that must have sucked...You know I love that guys newspaper. you thnk I can subscribe to it, no? I have to go get it free at the tourisum centre,in Campbellford."
556677,RJackson,2011-03-01 15:28:00,113, You certainly can subscribe to it.  Grab an issue there should be an ad in with instructions on how to go about it!  RJ
556679,Spiel,2011-03-01 15:34:00,9065,"Seriously, setting your rod down with a fish on it to get two hands on the net.... ?  I thinks ya deserve to lose it....."
556681,Headhunter,2011-03-01 15:37:00,5703,A big ass Daredevil and a couple of casts and you get both the rod and the fish back! HH
556686,rob v,2011-03-01 15:46:00,535,that's what surprised me about that episode..... I would've thought they'd have tried that for sure (snagging the rod that just went over).   Perhaps they did off camera and weren't successful ?
556700,SmokestackLightnin,2011-03-01 16:13:00,390,"It's staged.  Look at the camera angle at 1:36, there is another camera behind the boat and I would think they pulled the rod in."
556703,MCTFisher9120,2011-03-01 16:22:00,3761," Obviously haha, looked like a Chronarch on that setup too..."
556716,mercman,2011-03-01 17:04:00,7054,I guess when you get your stuff for free you can be a little less attentive.i woulda dived in after it.
556719,lew,2011-03-01 17:26:00,12766," Funny you say that Joe....  I was daydreaming one day and dropped an expensive combo in 20' of water, so I clipped a Daredevil on another rod and started dragging it thru the weeds.  Felt some weight and figured I'd got my gear back but when I reeled it in I'd caught a 5 pound pickeral.  Probably the only pickeral ever caught on bottom with a big azz Daredevil"
556728,Governator,2011-03-01 18:04:00,879,"  I'm with you, I would've gone after it for sure."
556730,Headhunter,2011-03-01 18:09:00,5703,"Good story Lew, but did you get the rod and reel back? You just don't see folks pulling Daredevils that much anymore... but boy do they cover water, cast a mile and I've found them to be multi-species as well... Heck, maybe I'll start a thread about them, so as to not highjack this thread anymore than I have.LOL HH"
556737,Guest gbfisher,2011-03-01 18:30:00,0,Some fishermen they are. No one even bothered to cast for it?
556762,Terry,2011-03-01 19:22:00,14456,this winter I almost lost my 1000 buck reel down a hole..got my hand wet but I didn't let it get away however the fish got away...got me thinking if I should really use the Calais TE DC on the ice  but why buy them if you ain't gonna use them
556782,charlesn,2011-03-01 20:25:00,551,"Jump in after it?  I wouldn't recommend it even for Michael Phelps, who knows how cold that water is and I don't care how well you can swim - can you outswim a fish!  As far as casting out and trying to get it - I'm sure they did.  It's not that easy.  You can ask Mark Kulik, we were out on Erie this past spring and sure enough - an unattended rod took an unintended swim with a fish attached to it.  His favourite drop shotter.  It wasn't windy and I dropped a Waypoint immediately.  I cast a rattle trap type bait dredging the bottom for a solid 20 minutes in the area until by complete fluke I hooked the line.  Unfortunately as he was hand bombing the rod and reel back in it got stuck on bottom and broke the line.  The fish was gone.  But on a fairly windless day knowing pretty darn well where the rod went in - we spent 20 minutes dissecting the area in an expanding spiral until we snagged it.  And it was WAY off the original waypoint.  The only rod and reel I've ever kicked over board I was able to get because we could clearly see it on the bottom and it wasn't moving in current and/or attached to a fish.  Even so, it took several attempts to snag it.  It's just a part of fishing - sometimes you need to make that sacrifice to the fishing gods to get them to bite better.  It worked for Mark and I.  I think the sacrifice hurt less for me than for him though.  lol"
556783,misfish,2011-03-01 20:31:00,29133," Yep had one slide off the back of David Chongs boat when we fished Erie in 6 fters.Thought about it,then said nadda going to jump in. I just cried abit and kept fishing.LOL"
556784,Guest gbfisher,2011-03-01 20:40:00,0,  I was makin fun of them and the fact they lost it. Wouldn't be the first time I've seen that happen..  .lol I'm also pretty sure the guys in that boat could afford to lose a few rods and have them replaced by sponsors for just mentioning it.
556789,solopaddler,2011-03-01 20:58:00,8605,"Stuff like that happens all the time. Big Jim looked pissed though.   Two summers ago I was on a back lake with my then 5 year old daughter.  She caught a nice pike and I laid my rod down to deal with it.  Of course a 3lb smallie grabbed my jig and dragged my $400 rod/reel overboard.  It sank straight down to a shelf about 15' below me. Then started being dragged by the bass into this huge 35' hole.  I threw my daughters pike away and without thinking--just reacting, dove overboard to catch my rod before it was pulled into the abyss.  I just grabbed it in time. When I did the bass went airborne and I was actually fighting it underwater.  Lipped it beside the boat with one arm around the gunnel.  Definitely a memorable fish.  My little girl tells everyone ""Daddy dives in after the fish!!!"""
556797,lew,2011-03-01 21:12:00,12766," Nope, never saw it again Joe, it was a nice Curado & Shimano V-rod sacrificed to the fish gods."
556815,Handlebarz,2011-03-01 21:43:00,3790,Dang that was sure funny and sad at the same time.
556823,bigugli,2011-03-01 21:51:00,6138,"Had one pulled off the dock by a bass. Lost my fave mitchell reel. A friend of mine found it diving 2 months later, 80' from the dock. I've lost rods over the side and almost always managed to retrieve them. I have also hooked up and retrieved lost rods while drifting for walter. In good shape too."
