556083,Handlebarz,2011-02-27 21:29:00,3790,Sounds like a great time one of these days I will make the event but I just got home from a BOD meeting it was not near as much fun as the event looked.
556110,Shelley Cooper,2011-02-27 22:45:00,394,"Great Report Brian... and a great day forsure..was good to see you again...  Congrats again.. I knew you were smilin ear to ear as you pulled up that fish, I couldn't get over there fast enough for some actions shots.. but I have great memories now.. You can catch fish..    lol"
556116,Woodsman,2011-02-27 22:58:00,1286, They were nice chairs but not the best crowd for a auction for them. May have been better for the online auction?? Any out of town folks would have had no way to get them home other than a chair or two at best.
556287,tonyb,2011-02-28 14:21:00,1637,"Another great Fishing for Tyler derby has come and gone, and it was a great day of fishing for many.  My wife decided to join me for the day, and when we arrived to our spot, we drilled a hole and put the sonar down to check depth and see if there were any fish.  Nice surprise, we were marking fish right away, perfect!    While she finished her timmies, I had already grabbed a rod with a jig and fired it down the hole.  Not 5 minutes later I had our first whitefish on the ice, going to be a good day!     While, as murphy's law would have it, as soon as I setup the hut and heater, the sonar screen went blank!    The fishing slowed for the rest of the time until weigh-in but my wife taught me a new technique to trigger whitefish that are inactive.  She was messing around with the rod, kind of whiplash jigging if you will, mixed in with turbo reeling up from bottom about 40 feet at a time, then dropping back down.  Through all of this, I think the fish must have thought there was no way a human is moving the a lure like that, it has to be food! and they would chase it up and smash it!!!  That was pretty cool I must say.  Also, I learned that the Clam Base Camp Thermal hut's windows are too high to be able to see a tipup from a normal chair height.  Going to have to get some bar stools or something lol      We didn't catch any on the tip-up but we certainly had some bites, as the minnows were constantly being stolen while the tip-up indicating fish activity below was out of sight.  I would have to periodically stand up to check on it, so the lazier I got, the more bites I missed  I regret that we didn't get any pictures of the fish on the ice, but here's a shot of the ones we kept.  Amanda's are the 2 bigger ones (just under 26"") and mine is the smallest one    Looking forward to next years event! See you all there.  Oh! And I went back to the same spot on Sunday and filmed a web episode with Aaron Shirley.  It will be online soon - IN FULL 1080 HD to boot!, and when it goes up I'll let you guys know.  We share all of our secrets for catching Whitefish, and get some incredible footage obove and below the ice! and it should turn out to be a great informative and fun show, be sure to watch it.  Here's one way to draw attention to yourselves on the ice        See you on the water! Tony      "

Hope I'm not working nights next year, as I look forward to the Tyler event every year. Glad to hear it was a great turnout!"
555710,misfish,2011-02-26 20:39:00,29133,"Man has this event taken off. So many people showed up and the donations were mind blowing.  I decided to hook up with the chevy guiding service,as I havent been out enough to know where the go to spots were.When I find out the details of our travel,I said,this is going to be fun.  Plan was to travel accross the bay ,get on lake shore,then get back on the ice and travel north. I wasnt leading,so ok,lets do it.  Just as we approach Snake,we hit out first crack.Chevy checks it out and pick a point to cross.He goes first.Bit of a drop but made it. Ok my turn.Hi ho away I go. Piece of cake.  Get to the off ramp,get to our on ramp. A song came to me right away, as Chevy went down the hill.A chev got stuck,the ford was smart and took the packed down path.  Pull chevy out,well not me,another chevy.And we were off. Some vid of some of the ice road travel. I havent driven on the ice like this in years.Had a blast.Sorta.  <embed width=""600"" height=""361"" type=""application/x-shockwave-flash"" allowFullscreen=""true"" allowNetworking=""all"" wmode=""transparent"" src=""http://static.photobucket.com/player.swf""'>http://static.photobucket.com/player.swf"" flashvars=""file=http%3A%2F%2Fvidmg.photobucket.com%2Falbums%2Fv731%2Fmisfish%2F20110225_02.mp4"">  <embed width=""600"" height=""361"" type=""application/x-shockwave-flash"" allowFullscreen=""true"" allowNetworking=""all"" wmode=""transparent"" src=""http://static.photobucket.com/player.swf"" flashvars=""file=http%3A%2F%2Fvidmg.photobucket.com%2Falbums%2Fv731%2Fmisfish%2F20110225_03.mp4"">  We made two stops.Both produced fish. The second stop finaly produced my first whitie of the year and a team entry.      Andy,yer right,they pick it up from the side.As you can see,the side hook is right in the snout.  Todays company was great to be with as always.   LADY WALLEYE and her grand children.     Our guide for the day Chuckster,big chevy.    12 pm we pack up and Chevy and I head right down the middle of the lake.That was a great drive. The odd drift was hit,but I had no issues as Chevy was breaking the path. Once we got over the crack at Snake,I thought I would try the lead,but Chevy thought we were at Daytona and had a bit of a race going on.Fun til I started to go sideway. I was drifting, thats my story.   Got to the landing area and WOW  what a crowd.    Jose and his daughter.    Then it was auction time.Some northern redneck was there trying to sell his body,but there were no bids.CAN YOU ACUALLY BELIEVE HE WAS STARTING THE BID AT 50 CENTS.  Was great to see you Boss.Nice FLIPPERS.    I bidded on the spiel rod,but the other guy wanted it more Nice snag Kickingfrog.Very nice work Chris.  Seen so many older members of the board that I havent seen in sometime. A little older,greyer,but all in great spirits.  Sorry to hear Beanzies couldnt make it.Missed you out there my friend.  Met Bruce,ChrisK,and the big guy Slowpoke,Hoppy so many to mention.  Ah there was Fishfarmer. I walked up to him and says,I knowz u,yes me son I knowz ya buddie,I knowz yer mudder to.Thats was funny to see the look on his face.LOL  Great day to be out with friend and for a great cause.  Ok talk more later when the rest put up thier report.        Oh TJ,sry you have to wait til 9 to have a cold one.This one is going down just fine.   THANKS TO EVERYONE THAT DONATED AND SHOWED THIER SUPPORT. "

555730,crappieperchhunter,2011-02-26 21:27:00,2582,"Good weather and a good turnout. Big Cliff and I had a great morning chasing perch...and...herring. Don't know how many herring we caught, but it was lots. If the season ever reopens Cliff & I know one spot that is idiot proof for catching as many as you could want  Had a good visit with many while I enjoyed some burgers and dogs and then a coffee and I was on my way home.  Thx again for a good day on the water Cliff."
555736,Beans,2011-02-26 21:49:00,3339," I was there with you in spirit me son...This damn gout I've been afflicted with has curtailed most of my outdoor activities this winter...glad to hear you had a great time at ""Slyville""???...and that the Tyler Event was a resounding success again !!!    "

556030,d_paluch,2011-02-27 19:45:00,343,"yah it was my first time out to a derby...and really only my 4th time ice fishing. Going back to Simcoe this coming Saturday, will check out the MS derby on simcoe, but don't think I will be joining it. Overheard a few good tips like what FOW the fish were in and a few general spots. Now just need to get some tips on lures for whities/trout. Also have to pray that the weather stays cool enough and that there is no snowfall this week so I can still drive my Mazda3 to a spot on the ice  Here's hoping, right?"
556071,misfish,2011-02-27 21:02:00,29133, Missed that one.Wheres it held?
