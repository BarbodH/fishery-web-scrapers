503526,SylvanOwner,2010-09-13 15:49:00,266,Just as the title suggests I'm trying to find out if chumming is legal in the Kawarthas in the non-ice season?  The issue came up during conversation recently and I couldn't find anything in the regs. summary or by doing a search so would appreciate input from the community.  Thanks in advance for all your informed responses.

Luckily for me he does it in my presence also so I get to benefit for it.  It's a combination of things really, but if the conditions call for it, it works..."
