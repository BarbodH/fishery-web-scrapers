502851,kingjames_2nd,2010-09-10 02:36:00,72,"Hey there folks,  A friend of a friend caught this monster recently.  I don't know the dimensions but what would you estimate the weight based on the pic?  The guy in the picture is probably about 220 lbs..  maybe 5ft 8? "
502852,Guest LivingLegend,2010-09-10 02:44:00,0,"Nice juicy bass, did it put up a good fight?"

502919,Lunkerhunter,2010-09-10 12:56:00,455,my guess is 3 lbs .maybe 4
502934,thatleetboy,2010-09-10 13:39:00,143,"When I caught the smallie in my profile pic, my BiL sent me this useful link.... cuz all we knew was that it was 20 1/4 inches...  Cheers"
502945,tb4me,2010-09-10 14:07:00,3295,Thats a beaut! To bad it was killed thou. im guessin a 5lber anyway
502954,steverowbotham,2010-09-10 14:17:00,1800,I would call it 3.5 lbs but its so hard to say
503057,Guest Johnny Bass,2010-09-11 19:31:00,0,"I'd say 3 and a 1/2 to 3 and 3/4. It doesn't look 20 inches in the pic so like was said, its hard to tell. Still a nice bass and congrats on his PB."
503078,Cudz,2010-09-11 21:10:00,2652,Did he keep it?  lol!
503209,TerryC,2010-09-12 13:28:00,196," Yep, it's swimming happily in his bathtub.  3 1/2, Nice bass."
503211,Roy,2010-09-12 13:39:00,13728,I don't think it matters how much it weighed...it's a nice fish and congrats to your Bud.
503437,Leecher,2010-09-13 02:34:00,7832,"I won't even try to guess the weight.... like Roy said, it doesn't matter it's a nice fish     Congrats to you bud Leechman"
503502,kingjames_2nd,2010-09-13 13:36:00,72,"Hey folks.  I have some admitting to do.  My friend was fishing when she caught that fish.  She showed me the pic and my eyes jumped out of my head.  I said ""Tell me where you caught it or i'll steal the fish!""  She wouldn't tell me so I stole it...  with photoshop.  Here is the real fish and its real owner as you can tell by her facial expression. She did release it to swim another day but not before taking its weight on the scale......   6.4lbs  caught with a worm and a red/white bobber off the dock. "
503503,highdrifter,2010-09-13 13:53:00,2534,Thought something was up when I saw the red nail polish..  Got a lot of time on your hands eh?!?!  Nice fish though!!
503509,tb4me,2010-09-13 14:55:00,3295,ha ha funny..Im going to add thank-god it wasn't killed. I was disturbed by the fact that it was in a kitchen. What a beaut! The fish isint bad either
