503578,misfish,2010-09-13 21:48:00,29133,  Never seen a salmon run. Whats it look like?    Casted chunks of skien off the old Texaco pier. Did well.But you had to have the big waves coming from the south.Thanks for reminding me of the memories Bill.
503240,ctranter,2010-09-12 14:31:00,543,"  Tiny, whats your point?"
503242,daryl0815,2010-09-12 14:34:00,225,"  That is a good point, you seem to have pissed off a few people here! if people would have read your post they would understand what it is all about. I cant beleive that the guy you talked to didnt think that was wrong, its not fishing to line a fish, its cheating.  I have used marshmallows, and I have observed fish actually moving over to hit them, just last night I caught a 12"" rainbow on a mallow fished on bottom. At the same time, I am sure that a certain percentage of the fish swim into it, or swim into the line by accident, but to do it on purpose isnt right.  The past 2 days I have been Salmon fishing twice, and I have caught no salmon, the fish were right in front of me, I could have easily flossed them, but I chose not to, actually I much prefer to catch trout anyways!"
503252,BillM,2010-09-12 14:53:00,17367," Go to any pier this time of year, that's exactly how people floss fish  It's not the marshmellow that gets them initially, it's the 30 meters or so of line you've got strung across the river they run into."
503306,markiemark70,2010-09-12 18:42:00,158,"Ok I get it now: your issue (or some peoples) is with fishing in the river period. Because the same thing you just described is true of anything you throw in the river.  If so then I guess its a case of to each their own. I have no issue with catching fish in the river, and I know what I am doing is not illegal or unethical. I am a 100% catch & release guy, so if I thought I was abusing the resource I would never do it.  I totally agree that flossing or intentionally snagging is wrong, but I have no issue whatsoever with this"
503308,BillM,2010-09-12 18:47:00,17367," Huh?  I don't have an issue with fishing the river.  If I want to catch chinnies, I'll toss J13's or float big hunks of skein in the frog water (Which I've been very successfull this year at doing FYI)  Keep telling yourself it's not unethical to float marshmellows above a 3 way rig with 30 meters of line strung across the river.  And you are comparing this with casting or floatfishing?  LOL!!!!!  I'm happy most of you guys are gone once the bad weather gets here so I can steelhead fish in peace.."
503321,ctranter,2010-09-12 20:07:00,543," My thoughts as well, except 1 problem  When the salmon neanderthals leave, the pompous know-it-alls show up for steele.  Sometimes I have to stop myself before being embarrassingly rude, like some of them."
503326,Roy,2010-09-12 20:33:00,13728,Careful dudes...this one may head south as well.
503330,aplumma,2010-09-12 20:40:00,6896,  No point in sending it South Roy we don't have the Salmon issue.  But if it gets here I will be happy to lock it down for you.   Art
503343,SRT8 smoker craft,2010-09-12 21:24:00,1107,"Hey Art have you ever seen picks from the catt river never been there myself but from the pics its like fishing a Lake O trib times a million LOL. I was gonna stay out of this 1 but can't resist LOL Afraz quick ? How do ya figure flossing can only be done under a float ? The real question involved in this debate is will a salmon hit a bait legitematly because its true they Do Not eat while in the river and even though a lot don't believe it the answer is absolutely they will HIT out of aggresion,instinct because they can I really don't know why they do but they do. Salmon fishing isn't for everyone heck I only go once or twice a year (not at all last year) I hate the crowds and after a couple nooks its boring to me but if for a second I thought what I was doing was unethecal I wouldn't do it. I'm heading out early monday to hit a lake O trib and if I foul hook a fish I shake it off or break the line if its in the mouth I haul it in for a pic and release it this topic will always be a touchy subject. BTW Afraz and Art I'm just being a PITA not tryin to start anything"
503344,fishinguypat,2010-09-12 21:33:00,547, Because I have some some small flies I found in a pouch once that had nymphs and egg imitations in it and I have never used them before

503400,ctranter,2010-09-13 01:40:00,543," Sorry, I assumed you were implying something else.  I was using a small black fly (I'm new to flies so I'm not 100% about details), but I guessed the hook on it was about size 16, super small.  The eggs I've never used.  I don't think I would when I have a freezer full of trout roe"
503427,markiemark70,2010-09-13 02:16:00,158, So my stationary marshmallow on a single hook is a problem but you ripping a rapala with two sets of treble hooks is the ethical way? And exactly where did I compare anything to casting or floatfishing? Totally missed that part.  Anyways I don't really care to get into it with you. To be honest I went that one year like 3 years ago and have not been back. I prefer casting for Bass or pike to that. But I don't like having words put in my mouth and I don't like being accused of harming the fish. If you knew me you would know that I am about as ethical as you can get when it comes to natural resources.  You can have your Steelhead all to yourself as far as I am concerned. Good luck.
503433,Twocoda,2010-09-13 02:24:00,4130,lol..the salmon issue is like a rerun of Gilligans Island...  Ill say it now .....Salmon DO eat in the rivers especially this time of the season ....they are top predators... just because they enter the river system does not make them forget they still have to eat to survive....a BUCK that goes into a rut stops eating too ....but he isnt stupid enough to starve himself to death... the hens will act on aggression once they start spawning to protect their eggs from bait fish...hence the reason chucking body baits is a good thing and will catch fresher run fish ( they are still in predator mode)  Marshmellows is no different then blowing up a worm or putting floaties in your tied roe bags...bait is bait ...to each is his own ...its the presentation that is in question ...not the bait...  there is my 02 cents worth ...

503454,BillM,2010-09-13 03:39:00,17367," The fish has a choice to eat my J13, it doesn't have a choice when it swims by and gets caught up in your 30 meters of mono"
503455,ctranter,2010-09-13 03:53:00,543,Sometimes I walk my dog down by the humber and watch the salmon move up the fish ladders at a few dams.  Spend 5 minutes watching them and you will see 100$ worth of rapala and other various lures stuck in their backs when they jump.  If people are going to intentionally snag fish then they probably will use tackle with more hooks.
503487,4thgen,2010-09-13 12:37:00,157,"Back when I first started pier fishing, I couldn't figure out two things: why I always had teeth marks in my egg sinkers, and why I had to reel in a bunch of line after feeling a ""hit"", before actually feeling the fish.  Having spent countless nights out on piers now, I can tell you that 99 out of 100 salmon that are caught on bottom rigs didn't bite. When marshmallows work just as well as ear plugs, styrofoam and cigarette butts, you should know something is up.  Although the occasional salmon might bite in the small pools up river, once again 99% of them are lined or flossed. Totally unsporting and not much fun either.  I haven't fished for salmon anywhere but a pier in years and I can tell you that lures are quite capable of outfishing flossers. The hits are awesome and you actually get headshaking. Being able to turn a fish when it runs -- priceless."
503500,BITEME,2010-09-13 13:19:00,1968,"Well here is my take on this I have fished salmon this way ever since I was a kid marshmellow and when they came along earplugs I troll em I spoon feed em, flies flat fish  j-plugs you name it but this time a year if you want to call it flossing so be it . In my opinion even at this time of year chucking spoons you are still flossing them there might be the odd buck that actually hits the spoon but if you take a really close look at the fish you are getting on spoons you stick them in the outside of the jaw or deep in the corner inside Im sure there will be people that disagree and are purist in some weird way  and may wind up with a few people not liking me Oh well to each his own I will fish this time of year this way until I cant walk anymore And for all the people that know best put on a diving suit hop in the water with a camera and prove it wrong when the ministry comes along and says no more I will abide until then it will be business as usual the way I have fished them my father fished them and his dad and he used a piece of drift wood and a nail for a weight.  my 2 cents Peter"
503527,Swan_Dive,2010-09-13 16:09:00,46,"So what do you guys say to the kid or new salmon guy who wants to fish for the salmon right now?  I started this year, but have only been out once but when I was out I was using the same setup as I would for steelhead.  So if Iam float fishing is that what you guys are calling flossing?  It seems that if your floating a bait vertical and the salmon don't want to eat it they would move.  Do they let leaves and branches float in their mouth too while they are sitting with their mouths open?  My understanding of flossing (before this thread) was when you can see a salmon and you try to time your bait to fall in his mouth as he opens it, not floating a bait down a muddy/deep pool where you can't see them.  I don't want to stir things up more with this but I want to get an understanding of the ethical way to do things and if what I was doing was ""flossing"" well I would change my technique to what would be proper."
503535,dobee,2010-09-13 16:55:00,301, exactly
503559,misfish,2010-09-13 19:21:00,29133,"Hotshot kwikfish baits at the bend, for many years in Angus.It was a rush when they hit. And that aint no Bull.Yes salmon do eat in the river."
503561,Lunker777,2010-09-13 19:53:00,866,"why is it that EVERY YEAR @ this time, this site turns into a salmon/trout fishing pissing match ?"
503570,BillM,2010-09-13 20:44:00,17367," Cast the estuary water (slow frogwater river mouths) with J13's, spoons etc..  If you want to float fish, giant chunks of skein on big single or even treble hooks (Trebles work great for keeping the skein on)...  If the fish are on, you'll get bit using both methods..  If they aren't, you won't catch much of anything..."
503572,Duckie,2010-09-13 21:14:00,305,  probably because this is the time of year that the salmon are running..
503019,Cudz,2010-09-10 22:34:00,2652,"I was buying some rod tips for a friend and this guy asks the owner if she has any marshmallows?  I look at him and ask him what kind of fish he is trying to catch with marshmallows.  He tells me salmon.  I shake my had and laugh.  Then I ask him if he is flossing (obviously) and he answers yes.  I tell him that cigarette buts work just as well and that isn't really fishing.  I must admit that I did not know what flossing was until about 2 or 3 years ago and I never did it as a kid fishing on the river.  Now I know, I would never even try it.  Maybe people who do it don't realize it is kind of like cheating or snagging.  Is it possible if they were more informed that they would stop doing it?"
503023,skinny,2010-09-11 16:13:00,442,what is flossing
503028,timmeh,2010-09-11 16:28:00,609,"Honestly I suspect that a significant percent of people who are flossing don't realize they are snagging fish. Since they are hooked around the mouth often, many believe the fish are hitting every time. It can be hard explaining to someone that they're snagging.  As for stopping, I would bet that even if most people realized what they're doing, they wouldn't stop. A salmon run brings out some of the most ridiculous anglers (apologies to those who legitimately fish for them, I know some of you do). It's there one chance a year to catch them and catching them is all they care about, technique is not relevant."
503039,k-max,2010-09-11 17:37:00,20," letting the current float your line into the mouth of a salmon that is stationary in the river with it's mouth open, when you pull on the line you can hook the salmon in the mouth, but its really snagging as the salmon is not feeding."
503041,k-max,2010-09-11 17:40:00,20, If people could bring big gill nets to the river and dredge anything swimming out of it they would....i think flossing is at least a smaller problem for the ministry to manage.  Though I do believe if they catch anyone intentionally snagging a fish they will be fined.  Guess with flossing its harder to prove.
503048,markiemark70,2010-09-11 18:16:00,158,"Are you sure they were doing something wrong? A few years ago I tried my hand at salmon for the first time. I asked around at a few tackle shops and on this board and was told that marshmallows were good bait. I was certainly not ""flossing""  I tied the marshmallow on a 3 way swivel with a heavy weight on the bottom and let it sit there. I got a few hits in the couple of times I went, and I can guarantee you that the line didn't just fall into a salmons mouth: it was a hit, guaranteed.  Are you saying that anyone who uses marshmallows is a snagger or poacher?"
503054,Cudz,2010-09-11 19:22:00,2652, I asked him if he was flossing and he said yes.  I don't think anyone said he was poaching or even that it was illegal.

503064,Duckie,2010-09-11 20:14:00,305,"I like lures too. the other day at Bronte I had a big salmon hit my spoon so hard it almost pulled my rod from my hands. set the hook and it broke off instantly.  still, it was quite a rush.  salmon hit moving lures like a ton of bricks.  its awesome."
503065,k-max,2010-09-11 20:21:00,20,"You can also snag salmon casting off the pier, not just ""flossing"" but I guess its less intentional.  More than a couple times of Port Credit, I've ""lined"" a salmon, but the hook was never set and after a brief thrashing on the surface they swam off."
503098,markiemark70,2010-09-11 23:14:00,158, Ok I thought you meant because he was using marshmallows.
503111,fishinguypat,2010-09-12 00:24:00,547,there is snagging apparently ...purposely hooking a fish in the gills or mouth... or by letting the salmon swim through your line and get hooked in the mouth... or there is the drifting method where you drift with roe or skein and when it gets within close range of the salmon it gets hooked either by the line flowing through its mouth or because the salmon sucks in water and it happens to get hooked... so there is no possible way other than this to catch salmon on marshmellow other than this?
503128,BillM,2010-09-12 01:02:00,17367," Guys who use marshmellows are usually flossing fish, whether they are doing it intentionally or not..  Chinooks also don't 'suck in' giant chunks of skein, because for the most part the skein is fished vertically under a float, a marshmellow not so much...  Also, when people almost get their arms ripped off by salmon hits, you're usually racking the lure across their backs and are feeling a quick snap of their tail... I've have them bust off 10lb braid like this with ease...  Salmon fishing at it's finest!!!"
503143,fishinguypat,2010-09-12 01:32:00,547, braid has no stretch so it would brake easier in these situations
503164,ctranter,2010-09-12 03:20:00,543,"My last outting, I watched a salmon go out of its way to HAMMER a small fly.  It was all the proof I needed to see that salmon feed or at least attack in rivers.  That being said, when people show up to a popular eastern trib, casts past a wire into a dam area clearly marked as NO FISHING with a white and red bobber and 6 foot spinning rod, you kinda know something is up."
503165,GoneFishin,2010-09-12 04:25:00,349,"Most opinions on here come from people reading other peoples posts.. I use to do a lot of salmon fishing when I was younger and I can guarantee salmon will feed in the rivers. Flossing does happen for sure but just because something is floating by a salmons mouth doesn't mean it's going to go in there... If they don't want it they will avoid it plain and simple. I use to fish with large groups of people and we would use flies, roe, worms, artificial eggs, marshmallows (scented and un-scented) sponge, you name it. Some days nothing works, some days it would be everything and others you would need a certain bait. If you could only catch them by flossing then it would be the same pattern day in and day out."
503167,fishinguypat,2010-09-12 04:50:00,547, how small of a fly we talking here?
503169,timmeh,2010-09-12 05:50:00,609," I'm just curious, but how can you guarantee it was a hit? Did you actually see the underwater salmon chase down the stationary bait and hit it? W\ Or was it just because the hook was in the mouth?"
503170,Afraz,2010-09-12 08:01:00,250,"Not all marshmallow users are snaggers, the marshmallows they sell at Lucky's with ""trout Bait"" written on them isn't there for no reason. And flossing only works if you are using a float i seriously doubt anyone could floss using a Pickrel rig with 2 marshmallows and a heavy sinkeron bottom fishing out of a deep harbour.  "
503204,Cudz,2010-09-12 12:58:00,2652,"no doubt.  i used to fish salmon in the rivers and i can remember catching a nice 15 pound female on a ratltrap in the mouth.  No accident there.  It was probably a reaction strike but she was also still pretty silver. I believe that fish do still eat in the rivers but that is not what I started this thread for.  My issue was that when I asked the guy if he was flossing for salmon, he said ""yes""."

I will not fish for salmon in rivers, however early in the season from a couple of the piers I like (not on Lake O) casting Cleos or Fat Raps/Wally Divers can be a blast.

The thing is, I grew up and realized it was wrong.  People either get it, or they don't. - At the time, I also didn't understand the concept of catch and release.  I'm not saying people who don't C&R also illegally snag fish, but it wasn't until I viewed the fishery’s sustainability as something that my actions had an effect on did I see the error of my ways."
503222,markiemark70,2010-09-12 13:49:00,158," Well I can guarantee you that I wasn't snagging. My line was underwater with no float, it was 30 meteres or so out in the muddy river and it was dark out, so I would need some pretty good eyesight to snag the fish. You can't tell me that a fish can hit a moving lure doing 20 knots or so in the water, but they can't avoid a marshmallow bobbing around in the current. That just doesn't make sense."
503225,swampash,2010-09-12 13:57:00,1,"Hot n Tots work great in the river also, if there isn't too much debris to get stuck on. I've fished these straight off the back of my boat while anchored above a hole and they nail them. I also cast them from shore and have had alot of luck."
