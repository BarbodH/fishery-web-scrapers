499411,misfish,2010-08-29 00:41:00,29133,Too bad there wasnt more insentives for the spotter?
499412,Chabot,2010-08-29 00:53:00,22,  Hi Brian !  sorry i have a bad english i don't understand what did you said !
499415,danbouck,2010-08-29 00:59:00,4380, Non plus le mauvais là n'était pas plus d'insentives pour l'observateur ?
499417,danbouck,2010-08-29 00:59:00,4380,If it wasn't so far away I would definitely be in.
499429,Chabot,2010-08-29 01:55:00,22,HOO !! LOL for the google translation ... didn'T understand a word even in that language !  I'm sorry for you ! but did you think about taking a room and stay in valley field for the wee-end ? maybe that a solution !
499434,misfish,2010-08-29 02:38:00,29133,"Sorry  Chabot,what I meant was.If you want spotters,then maybe the event should offer free lodging for those that have to travel a distance. I did the old CFT when it was in Barrie.Local and no cost to me.Hopefully you can find interested guys/gals in the same boat, in the local area.  It,s a great experince and the knowledge from these anglers,is next to none."
499482,Chabot,2010-08-29 12:54:00,22,  HO ! Ok !  Understand what you say now ! For sure it would be great if the hotel room was free for every one but 75 x 200$ ( 2 nights ) its a lot of money ... It won't happen !  Have a nice day
