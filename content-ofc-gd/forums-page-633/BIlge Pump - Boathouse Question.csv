503348,danbouck,2010-09-12 22:25:00,4380,My boat is making the move from the dock into the boathouse this weekend for the fall. But I would like to spray out the boathouse to clean it up first. I was thinking of hooking a hose up to an old bilge pump and spraying it out that way. Will a bilge pump be able to handle that?  I think it's a 400gph pump

503357,aplumma,2010-09-12 23:02:00,6896,If you are intending to use a 12 volt bilge pump rated at 400 gpm it will not have any head pressure. The pump is a centrifugal pump that is spaced for volume not pressure to test this just put your finger over the outlet and see how easy it is to stop the flow. Their are 12 volt pumps that will work look for a wash down pump they are designed for pressure not volume.
