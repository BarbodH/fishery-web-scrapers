503390,Grimace,2010-09-13 00:45:00,2020,Great report and a cool idea.
503068,Cudz,2010-09-11 20:48:00,2652,"Ok, so it wasn't a real tournament but we have these on a regualr basis and today I won.  Each person has 30 minutes to choose a spot to fish and the other 2 people in the boat obviously have to follow (we are all in the same boat). Every 30 minutes there is a new person in charge of location so it is always changing. Prize is 20 wings to winner with the losers paying. We weigh our 3 biggest bass. Today, I won.  Jaydub and Jimmy are buying the wings on Monday night.  Woohoo! Here are a few pics of some of the hogs we got into. My biggest fish.  Jaydubs biggest fish of the day  Jimmy's biggest fish of the day. (And it looks like a tornado might be in the region as well) "

503072,spincast,2010-09-11 21:04:00,3279,cool concept. Looks like you were all winners today.
503073,ld17,2010-09-11 21:05:00,319,looks like you all did good.  That's a great idea you guys have to try and fish different spots.
503075,Joey,2010-09-11 21:06:00,9122,"Cool, sounds like fun.  Enjoy the wings and Nice Fish!!  Joey"
503081,drewbrew,2010-09-11 21:31:00,31,Cant get much better than that eh! Lots of Smallies(well biggies) and chicken wings.lol. Nice pics.
503104,Fisherman,2010-09-12 00:05:00,7201,"Now tell the truth, this is a well conceived tournament just so you can get into Hooters and get some wings...right.  Nice fish."

503166,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2010-09-12 04:27:00,0,i love those big sloppy simcoe smallies. even better than the wings is the bragging rights and smack talk as you enjoy your meal.
503208,jaydub,2010-09-12 13:17:00,145,Congrates on yesterday's win Cudz ...we won't tell'em bout Monday's tourney  Nice art work on Jimmy's pic
503212,Cudz,2010-09-12 13:43:00,2652,What happened Monday?  Where are the pics and the report?  As far as I am concerned there is no proof that there was even a tournament on Monday.
503218,The Urban Fisherman,2010-09-12 13:46:00,2050,"Congratz on the win dude!  Any endorsement offers on the table yet?  Nice smallies - thanks for the report...  Cheers, Ryan"
503220,lew,2010-09-12 13:47:00,12766,Some very impressive fish for everyone involved there Cudz & congrats on the win.   It's always fun when you can make things a bit more interesting with a little competition against buds.
503247,daryl0815,2010-09-12 14:47:00,225,"Well done man, those are all some big smallies, and that sounds like an interesting idea for a little tournament, I might have to try something like that in the future.  Oh and you guys are quite brave to go out in a tornadoe, especially on Simcoe!  I am nervous to take my 14' tinnie and 9.9 out there, I imagine that tornadoes like that can come up at any time, and the closer you are to shore the more they swirl!  Daryl"
503249,Bly,2010-09-12 14:52:00,1556,Nice fishin......enjoy your wings!
503250,TJQ,2010-09-12 14:53:00,7806,Nice fish!! Congrats... no better prize than wings!!
503263,spinnerbaitking,2010-09-12 15:13:00,1622,Nice look'n Smallies Congrats & what happened Monday maybe some of us would believe their story with out pictures lol Richard
503292,jaydub,2010-09-12 17:27:00,145," You're right, no proof of that one on OFC. If there was ever a tournament I should have posted a report for that was the one...lesson learned"
503293,Cudz,2010-09-12 17:39:00,2652,My team on Monday got outsmarted by another team
503294,limeyangler,2010-09-12 17:40:00,5204,"Great win Cudzy,  'hooters Family Restaurant'...."
