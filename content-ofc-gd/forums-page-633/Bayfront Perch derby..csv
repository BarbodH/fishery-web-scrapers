503490,greg1983,2010-09-13 12:40:00,20,Thank you for letting us advertise the derby on the OFC.  We just wanted to thank everyone who came out to the perch derby.  We really appreciate the support.  Over 100 contestants made it out.  The weather was a lot nicer than we got for the first attempt.  Doanato caught the biggest perch which was just shy of 1 pound.    Fishing was a little slower derby day than it was during the week.  Uploaded with ImageShack.us   Erica won the child division 6.92 ounce perch.
