503213,The Urban Fisherman,2010-09-12 13:43:00,2050,"I put the kids to work on some fresh carp bait!    Mom wasn't to impressed that I let them do it AFTER they had a bath! haha            Took him a good 10 minutes or so to peel ONE cob!            If the rain holds off the kid and I will be heading down for some local carp action.... And if we get rained out we'll join the dogs for a little of this instead...    Hopefully we'll have a report this afternoon!  Cheers, Ryan & the kidz"
503224,Pigeontroller,2010-09-12 13:56:00,2793,Cute kids Ryan!
503235,Guest Johnny Bass,2010-09-12 14:20:00,0,Yup. Mother knows best. The kids could catch a nasty cold. Other than that? Looks like good old fashioned family fun!
503237,The Urban Fisherman,2010-09-12 14:22:00,2050, ah it wasn't very cold..she was more so concerned about them gettin' dirty again... part of living in the country..
503245,Bly,2010-09-12 14:37:00,1556,Cute Ryan.  Good luck with the carp today
503246,asdve23rveavwa,2010-09-12 14:46:00,2690,"Go get 'em, Ryan!!  FYI, we did get the boat out on ""the Bay"" yesterday, got a few (very few, lol) keepers, just had them with eggs for breakie.  Not too much action, in the ""pack"".  Sounds like Friday was the better day."
503254,TJQ,2010-09-12 14:55:00,7806,"I'm reporting you to Children s Services, you obviously abuse them and are an unfit parent.... (Hey... can you report me so they can come and get mine.. LOL. College is coming faster than I anticipated...)"
503255,danbouck,2010-09-12 14:55:00,4380, FYI - 6.8 FOW west of Willies
503262,asdve23rveavwa,2010-09-12 15:11:00,2690," Thanks for the info, Dan!!!  The boys are a little hesistant on fish at times, but, Caelan's eyes lit up when he tasted that perch (half Cajun/half garlic butter Fish Crisp) this morning!"
503264,spinnerbaitking,2010-09-12 15:18:00,1622, I was thinking the same thing unless of course he's paying them minimum wage lol Richard
503265,OhioFisherman,2010-09-12 15:30:00,6623,Room and board for a little labor isn`t a bad deal. Did they get to sample the bait?
