There's a reservoir there and I drive by it everyday going to work.  If anyone could tell me about it that would be great.  I tried googling it and someone said people get mugged out of their gear?  Its really close to me and I would love to know if its a safe spot with fish where I could spend a couple hours after work.  Thanks!"

502977,winterwisp,2010-09-10 15:35:00,3,Yikes!  I guess I shouldn't go there then.  It's a pity because its the closest fishing place to me.  I have to drive about 45 minutes to guelph lake to fish now.

502997,Guest Johnny Bass,2010-09-10 17:02:00,0,I live relatively close to it and the park is safe. I know people used to catch carp in there.

503003,ctranter,2010-09-10 17:14:00,543,"That park has seen it's fair share of sirens.  I remember when I was in high school some kid my age was beaten to death by other high school kids, and a few bodies have turned up.  That being said, I walk my dogs there twice a week and I know for a fact its safe during the day.  I met a guy there who fishes it for carp, he seemed to think it was a great location for them, but I wouldn't know.  On a side note, how about that huge lake they are digging in downsview park, lets hope they stock it with some bass or bows!"

503049,winterwisp,2010-09-11 18:23:00,3,Thanks for all the replies!  I checked it out yesterday but didn't bring any corn.  I've never fished for carp before (I'm still very new to fishing).  I'll give it a shot again sometime this week.  Thanks again!
