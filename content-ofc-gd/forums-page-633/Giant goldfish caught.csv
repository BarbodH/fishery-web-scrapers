502910,corvette1,2010-09-10 12:09:00,1765,looks bigger than 30
502917,Dave Bailey,2010-09-10 12:33:00,1641,A goldfish is just a carp with bling.
502957,OhioFisherman,2010-09-10 14:25:00,6623,"I used to see them in Lake Erie, but never that size 3-5 pounds? and never any small ones, they stick out like a sore thumb and get eaten quickly. In ponds that I have seen them in that also had bass? They almost never ventured out of very shallow water."
502959,Garnet,2010-09-10 14:33:00,2056,I've caught them up to 3 lbs on erie. That was 40 years ago they might be bigger now.
502963,otter649,2010-09-10 15:05:00,118,I have an old VHS tape (late 80s) of Babe Winkleman fishing on Lake Erie & his guide/host used goldfish for bait instead of native minnows seemed to work pretty good for the fishing party.........
502982,tb4me,2010-09-10 15:47:00,3295,Yikes! I guess we now know where they came from in erie. Cant use em as bait anymore. Interesting read the baitfish primer.
502983,livinisfishin,2010-09-10 15:48:00,661,I think its a fake pic
502984,Steve_R,2010-09-10 15:53:00,81,I agree that is fake
503004,ehg,2010-09-10 17:19:00,2666,"Actually that is a carp, goldfish have jaws and regular fish mouths. Maybe the colour is photoshopped."
503031,OhioFisherman,2010-09-11 17:07:00,6623,"I don`t think Babe Winkleman was at fault, I grew up in Cleveland 3 miles from the lake and used to see them as a kid. Really a lot of causes for it, people build fish ponds in flood prone area, and the first flood gives them a chance to wander. In this area everything drains into Lake Erie, but people releasing pet gold fish into rivers and streams also.  My brother also used them as bait in the 70`s? he said smallies thought they were candy. A bit pricey as a bait supply unless you raise them yourself?  Ohio`s fishing regs could be deemed as confusing?  ""Fish caught by legal angling methods (such as bluegills caught by hook and line) may be used for bait."" which may be misleading? other species are not excluded? such as goldfish or gobies? could you argue an undersized walleye or bass caught by legal angling means?  ""It is unlawful to use fish species that are not already established in Ohio waters."" There is clear evidence that gobies and goldfish are presently established? and what penalties did the perpetrators of that face?  Actually one of my first experiences fish was in the old Ohio barge canal for goldfish, like in the later 50`s? and it emptied into Lake Erie."
503173,Afraz,2010-09-12 08:11:00,250,Use baby Silver and bighead carp as bait LMAO !!!
