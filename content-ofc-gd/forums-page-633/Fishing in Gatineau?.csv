502765,mercman,2010-09-09 23:03:00,7054,  there seems to be a long dock and a beach area attached to the hotel right on lac lemay. You could probably fish there but dont forget your quebec fishing permit.
502783,Leecher,2010-09-09 23:53:00,7832,"Chong,  Lac Leamy's water level is so low right now that the shoreline is a slop.... last year the weed beds used to be a foot under.... this year you can see them on surface.  Me and my daughter tried it back in May a couple of times but all we caught was a ton of weeds casting spinnerbaits.  If you're going to give it a try to kill a couple of hours then the north side of the lake along the bike path is where you want to target.... start there and work your way towards the river mouth going eastward.... past the river mouth, there is a beach, might want to spend some time there too just never know.  Hope this helps you out and good luck!!! Tight lines Leechman   edit: OOPPSS!!! forgot to mention that there's no live bait allowed, you're in zone 10 and like Mercman said, make sure you get your non resident fishing license.... there's all kind of species in the body of water.... it's feed by the Gatineau river"
502795,chong,2010-09-10 00:31:00,102,"I'm from Montreal,is there any large mouth in the lac lemey? Can you give me a street name where i can go? Should I bring my waders?  "
502825,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2010-09-10 01:37:00,0,"not sure about walking distance, but as a kid we used to fish britannia rapids and island park for smallies.  this was on the ottawa side but i figured it was worth mentioning!  nothing over 2lbs hardly, but lots of numbers if you get right in and wade around.  #3 spinners were the weapon of choice."
502827,chong,2010-09-10 01:40:00,102,"  Thanks but I only have a Quebec permit,not worth getting an Ontario permit for 2-3hrs.  thanks anyways"
502828,Leecher,2010-09-10 01:41:00,7832," Yes there's LMB's in the lake and other species like pike, walleye, perch, musky, channel cats, etc...  If your staying at the Hilton Lac Leamy then you are basically walking distance from the lake.... find the bike path and your set.  You can basically ask the hotel employees to get there.... here's a google map link of the area Lac Leamy Down Town Hull  I've never seen anyone wade the shores before but it's probably a good idea to bring them along just in case..... once you see the lake you can decide what to do.  The perfect setup would be a kayak or canoe and work the outer edge of the weed lines  Hope this helps Leechman"

503428,Leecher,2010-09-13 02:17:00,7832, Sorry to hear that the fishes didn't cooperate    but at least you had a couple of hours on shore      beats painting windows all day Leechman
