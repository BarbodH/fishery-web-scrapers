493655,Fisherpete,2010-08-11 21:19:00,1814,I'm working on it!!! Trying HARD to get that week off...
493656,solopaddler,2010-08-11 21:25:00,8605, Hope it works out for you.
493657,Fisherpete,2010-08-11 21:36:00,1814,"Me too!!! The wife has given me her blessing, she has wanted to send me on one of these trips for a few years now, and what an opportunity this would be. Our baby boy is not due till November, so all good on that front, just working on the boss right now... first week of school is usually pretty hectic at my work.  The $650 is for the lodging & air costs I am assuming? What else should I budget for? Fuel for the drive up, food & drink costs, what else? I have never done one of these before..."
493661,solopaddler,2010-08-11 21:44:00,8605," You need to budget for fuel to get you there plus food and drink. Just get yourself to Nakina, pack your fishing gear, some clothes and food and off you go.  Included is return airfare from Nakina to the camp and back. Fully equiped camp which includes 2 full kitchens (you don't need to bring a thing), hot and cold running water includig shower, 16' Lund boats with new 15 horse 4 strokes plus unlimited boat gas.  The website goes into great detail explaining what is and isn't provided. If you havn't checked it out yet you should:  http://eddienorth.com/"

493817,solopaddler,2010-08-12 14:41:00,8605,"Still not a single person has taken advantage of this deal.  Lots of interest but no one has firmed anything up.  I'll be around the computer all of today then I leave for my camp in QC for 9 days.  As mentioned in my original post interested parties can contact me on my cel from Aug 13-21 at 289-440-1636 (preferably in the evenings).  Thanks,  Mike"
493938,solopaddler,2010-08-13 00:10:00,8605,"Just a quick update. Josh (bluesky1713 on the board) has booked a trip for himself and a friend. Congrat's to you bud, you'll have a fantastic time.   THERE ARE NOW A TOTAL OF FOUR SPOTS LEFT.  If you're on the fence you'd best make up your mind soon.  As mentioned I'm leaving tomorrow for 9 days at my camp in Quebec. I'm off the grid so the only way to reach me is on my cel.  If you're interested in going call me at 289-440-1636 in the evenings. If for whatever reason you don't reach me keep trying. I could be out fishing and out of cel range.  As the last 4 spots are filled Spiel will update the post for me.  Thanks everyone."
494061,FLEX ROD,2010-08-13 12:38:00,394,"When I saw this post I told my son about it and he was just about running for our tackle, as we had a fantastic time at Eddie's in July, 3-10.  With tear in my eyes I have to say that if the situation was different I would be all over this, this really is a fantastic offer by Eddie, just one more example of what kind of great guy he is and that is why we will be going back next summer.  I have not posted our trip report yet just to much going on but it will be up soon, it was just what we expected x 10, Eddie, you have set the bar quite high.  If you are sitting on the fence about going do not think twice, I can not belive that only 2 have taken Eddie up on this unbeliveble offer by Eddie.   Eddie, I will send the pics up to you soon,  the trip was amazing Julian and I cant wait.  FLEX"
495592,Mondo,2010-08-17 23:03:00,7,any new information on who is all going up the Eddies?
495618,Fisherpete,2010-08-18 00:17:00,1814,"*sigh* I can't get the week off of work. Aarrrgghhhh! Guess my 40""+ pike will have to wait a wee bit longer."
495757,Spiel,2010-08-18 11:47:00,9065, I haven't heard from Solo so I'm guessing there's been no new additions as to who's going.   
496882,solopaddler,2010-08-21 23:38:00,8605,Just walked in the door from an extended trip to Quebec.  There's still 4 spots available.  If anyone's interested I can respond directly now.  Cheers
496888,BillM,2010-08-22 00:21:00,17367,You people are crazy for not going!!!  Jump on this!  You won't regret it.
497267,solopaddler,2010-08-23 10:28:00,8605,2 more people are confirmed leaving 2 spots open.  Cheers
503379,yakpiker,2010-09-13 00:00:00,160,"Just got back from my 7 day fly-in fishing trip to the Attawapiskat River.  It was cold and rainy on 5 of the days and windy every day.  The pike fishing was tough, but the walleye cooperated and were tasty.  I landed pike of 39"", 41"" and 45"" and the other 3 guys landed pike of 40"", 42"", 43.5"" and 45"".  I've attached a pic of my biggest that was caught on a Five of Diamonds with a chartreuse gulp tail. "
503385,solopaddler,2010-09-13 00:13:00,8605, Well done considering the adverse weather you faced!  Have to say this probably deserved it's own post.  Cheers
503387,Grimace,2010-09-13 00:34:00,2020,That fish is a built like a bulldozer.   I agree with solo.  Write up a report for us.  I can't wait to see the other pictures and hear how the week went.  Cheers
503495,Lunkerhunter,2010-09-13 13:09:00,455,i too wouldnt mind seeing a report done up!
492498,solopaddler,2010-08-08 14:40:00,8605,"Eddie's first year in business has been a huge success largely due to the bookings and support from the OFC community.  After talking to him recently he would like to give something back and has extended what I think is a pretty generous offer.  He has an open week available for up to 6 people on Sept 4-11. This week sits squarely in between his last fishing party and his preparations for the fall hunt.  He's offering a full week at his camp for up to 6 people for $650 Canadian dollars tax in. Regular price is $1500.  If anyone has been contemplating a trip up there this may be a golden opportunity.  Obviously a group of 6 would be great but he'll book smaller groups together as well. I believe there's now two kitchens so groups that don't know each can be autonomous if they wish.  It's prime time as well. I went the same time last Sept and had a fantastic trip....lots of trophy pike.  He's currently at the camp and somewhat hard to reach so I'll be handling this for him, including procuring deposits of $200 per man.  If anyone is interested contact me directly at [emailÂ protected]  You can view Eddie's website here:  http://eddienorth.com/index.html   Cheers,  Mike"
492503,Spiel,2010-08-08 14:48:00,9065,"   I think that spells it out for my chances of going this fall.  But a big thumbs up for Eddie, very generous."
492505,bridge,2010-08-08 14:54:00,54,Sounds like a great offer.  After seeing posts from up there I'd love to try a trip like that but I start school on the 7th and after 13 years I don't want to be late.
492547,rock34,2010-08-08 16:48:00,215,"Very generous offer indeed.  I wish I could make it but like the posts before me, I just cant make it work....because of work!  Whoever goes though I am sure wont be dissapointed.  I think that part of the deal with the discount should be that there is a mandatory report posted afterwards.  What do you think?  I need to get my fix somehow.  Fishing has been few and FAR between this summer for me."
492567,solopaddler,2010-08-08 17:17:00,8605, Don't worry buddy there'll be other opportunities. As you mentioned fall steelheading is just around the corner as well.
492644,solopaddler,2010-08-08 21:03:00,8605,"Several people have contacted me but nothing firm.  Just so we're all on the same page here, it's first come first served to whoever commits.  Cheers,  Mike"
492712,Moosebunk,2010-08-09 00:43:00,3970,I'll talk to the wife............... better thought...  Last minute specials... they're the best but toughest to fill.  Had I not a trip planned already THIS offer would be saweet!
492713,Terry,2010-08-09 00:52:00,14456,can you believe at my work there is one week every year that they let no one take vacation days..and that's the week....what a sweet deal......
492923,solopaddler,2010-08-09 16:34:00,8605," How ironic, that's too bad Terry.  Still no one committed yet."
492944,Terry,2010-08-09 17:17:00,14456,"well I do maintenance for a school board and the first week of school ,people always find lots of problems for me to fix, so they do not allow vacation that week......  I don't think people here know just how good of a deal that is..it should be gone by now"
492956,anders,2010-08-09 17:48:00,1168,This SUCKS....im on moose hunt the week after this.  As most have already said   :wallbash:  :wallbash:  Hope some people jump on this!  Great offer...and kudos for eddie to extending this.
492957,troutologist,2010-08-09 17:53:00,951,"Again, work thwarts another chance at a great trip!  I'm up north during that time.  A great offer, I'm sure someone will get to enjoy this."
492958,Guest Johnny Bass,2010-08-09 17:58:00,0,"What a deal! Even I would have jumped on this chance! Unfortunately I have 2 surgeries and wont be healed till the end of October......  If anyone has been dreaming of a fly in, this is the perfect opportunity to make your dreams come true!"
492979,Fang,2010-08-09 19:00:00,1330,Looking to convince my fishin buddies of a trip there next year. My boss has me tied to the whipping post through to the 11th of Sept as we have a 3 day Canadian trade show starting on Saturday. Maybe easy to go but I'd have to look for a new job when coming back.  I'm hoping to book for next summer if my guys will committ
493016,TennesseeGuy,2010-08-09 20:08:00,957,"September 4-11 should be a hot fishing week.  New moon Wednesday, September 8.  Jump on this offer or sell your fishing gear and become a hair dresser."
493036,bdox,2010-08-09 20:49:00,329,"I have this week off, and if I hadn't just firmed up a private cottage on a trophy bass lake me and my 4 buddies would be all over this."
493040,solopaddler,2010-08-09 21:00:00,8605,"  Excuses excuses, Connie is right!  "
493042,DRIFTER_016,2010-08-09 21:02:00,10439,I'd be all over it Mike.  If I wasn't going to be heading to Alaska for 5 weeks starting on the 4th.
493047,jace,2010-08-09 21:18:00,472,"  1/2 price on this trip is amazing.  you can't do anything for a week at that price and this is a fishing trip.   I've been in AK for a little over 2 weeks working on this year's grand slam.  2 done, 3 to go.     Gonna try getting one in Cordova this year."
493086,Billy Bob,2010-08-09 22:42:00,5865,Why I have NEVER heard so MANY excuses why someone can't go fishing....BTW I can't go either....  ....wife goes back to work that week (school starts).
493090,DRIFTER_016,2010-08-09 22:51:00,10439,"  I'll be hunting Lakers, Bows, Dollys, Silvers, Steelhead, Halibut and Crab. I'll probably hook too many reds and pinks too. Nothing worse than hooking them off species when your in the thick of good bow fishing. Fishing for them now would be a different story, but when they are in spawning mode and all beat up they're just a pain.  You've been there for 2 weeks and only managed 2 of the 5? A couple of the guys on the Alaskan fishing board I'm a member of got their slams last weekend."
493185,jace,2010-08-10 09:14:00,472,"  I'm still here for another 5 weeks so I'm taking my time but I know a few people who chase the grand slam too.    It sounds like crazy fun but i doubt i'll ever do it that way.   I visit friends around the state while i'm at it so that really slows things down.   I have the red caught and some eaten so it's 3 now.  My red is still fairly bright.    Only the king and dog left, two of the best fighters.   I remember last year (or was it the year before?), we were about 50-60 miles apart.  I think you and Solo were getting into Cooper Landing or somewhere in upper Kenai and I was in Girdwood on my way out and heading northeast, well, west first to get around the mountains   .   so close and yet so far.  I opened an emailed photo of a 363 lb halibut that an acquaintance pulled this weekend.   I don't know if he entered the derby yet but if he did, they might as well write out that cheque now.  geez, that's twice my biggest but then I don't chase those trophies either.  The big ones are not the best eaters."
493219,Jds63,2010-08-10 12:50:00,1365,"I have been dreaming of doing this trip after reading your trip logs. I tried to  arrange something this year , however couldn't get any commitment from my buddys Unfortunately I have no holidays left either. If there will be any groups going next year that need an extra fella please keep me in mind. Thanks Solo."
493398,solopaddler,2010-08-11 00:44:00,8605,Just a bump. Amazingly still no one committed yet.  I've also included my cel number as I'll be at my camp in QC from the 13-21. Call after 8pm please when I'm up there. If you don't reach me keep trying!  Cheers
493416,yakpiker,2010-08-11 01:33:00,160,I did this trip the first week of July and I want to go again.  Solo says there are two of us interested.  We could put together a group for this week so don't hesitate if you are an individual or a pair.  This really is the opportunity of a lifetime for a fly-in trip with HUGE pike and endless walleye at an unbeatable price.  PM me if you want more info.  I've attached my biggest pike from Attawapiskat.
