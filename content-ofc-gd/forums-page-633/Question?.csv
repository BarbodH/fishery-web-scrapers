Also need to know what to use for cleaning the plastic windows.  Thanks Paul.  The last day of your life is like any other day, But shorter!"
503121,aplumma,2010-09-12 00:54:00,6896,"Paul I contacted Sunbrella awhile back and the only thing they recommend on their material is 303 High Tech Fabric Guard. I've found it in 16 oz, 32 oz and gallon containers. This product covers 75-100 sq feet per 16 oz.  303 products siteThe clear plastic can be cleaned with windex or equal as long as it says safe for tinted windows.    Art"
503239,Tybo,2010-09-12 14:31:00,1373,"Thanks Art.Can get some of the 303 in Mississauga. Your talking about the Windex that has no ammonia in it, right. I was was told that Pledge did great on the plastic.No degreaser to break the plastic down. Any one else heard of this."
503275,Spiel,2010-09-12 15:51:00,9065,Have you tried Acetone on the windows Paul or Deet?

503333,aplumma,2010-09-12 20:50:00,6896,Correct no ammonia but most of them are labeled safe for tinting. If you use pledge the oil in it fill the hazing but it also attracts dirt. Pledge will also soften stiff vinyl if your seats start to get sun damaged.  If the plastic is to clear then try Acetone and Deet it like spf 50 to keep the fair skin from getting tanned.   Art
