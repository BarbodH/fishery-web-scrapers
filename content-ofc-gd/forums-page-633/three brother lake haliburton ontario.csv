503466,singingdog,2010-09-13 09:56:00,1047,"I have been on them, but haven't fished them really hard. That chain of lakes has never impressed me. Much better fishing on the other side of the road on Big East and it's satellites."
503532,rfmcrx,2010-09-13 16:44:00,42,"we went out last night and slayed the bass. as soon as the sun hit the trees it was on, they were hitting black jitter bugs and holapoppers. every fish we pulled out was over 2 pounds, and the biggest came in at 4.5lb large mouth. There is nothing like catching large mouth on topwater baits, just the sound of them striking gets me excited."
