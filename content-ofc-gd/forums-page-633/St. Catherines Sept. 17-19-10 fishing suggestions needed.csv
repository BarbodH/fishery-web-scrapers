Can anyone give me some ideas of what I should use and what Marina is best to go out of. I have downriggers and rods and normal fishing stuff.  Thanks for your help.  Bing"

Lake Ontario fishing for staging Salmon is iffy...If the Lake is flat you could head out to deeper water and try for immature Kings or Rainbows. The Lower and Upper Niagara River has good Bass fishing, both are within 1/2 drive from St.Catharines. PM me if you require more info."

If u want bass stay along the breakwall in the rocks there are bass in 15 - 20 fow.  Email me if u wish  [emailÂ protected]"
