503485,Stoty,2010-09-13 12:28:00,2910,"Hey everyone,  I have just sold my Ranger, and before letting it go, I'd like to be able to save all my waypoints so I can install them on the new units that my Pro-V is coming with.  Anyone know how to download waypoints to a blank SD chip? (yes, I have a blank chip ready to go).  Any help is much appreciated!   *Stoty"

503489,Stoty,2010-09-13 12:38:00,2910,Just one question though.... if my new units are Hummingbird... which format should I save them in?
503491,Roy,2010-09-13 12:51:00,13728,From the Humminbird site:   Can I convert my Lowrance or Garmin Waypoints with Humminbird PC 3.026 or higher using an MMC/SD card? To see a video of this operation click here and then click on FAQs.
