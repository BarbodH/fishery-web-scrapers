503604,tb4me,2010-09-13 23:40:00,3295,Oh sure the net was there. The sad part is if it was there why did he touch it? Should have just called the tips line or police..If found guilty he's in a tad bit of trouble.
503614,Fisherman,2010-09-13 23:59:00,7201,"Well he got caught, hopefully they smack him with the book of fines."
