502701,blaque,2010-09-09 18:55:00,2419," Great pick Leech.....(La Villa) ......I dust the cobwebs off this one every now and again and its still one of the few solos that can give me goosebumps. Only downfall is that Id like to hear it go on a little longer.  Like this one...........put your headphones on, crank them..........put the video on full screen.....watch this act climax to the very end.... and forget everything as you know it, because this performance IS the meaning of life. If you cant muster a goosebump then lord help ya  "

502755,rylan,2010-09-09 22:28:00,134,"Can we vote on the best songs that are included in this thread- once a list is ready can we make a OFC Classic Rock Album that could, be played while we fish or just hanging out with friends??????   OFC Classic Rock the greatest hits  Has anyone thought on this before?"
502769,mikeymikey,2010-09-09 23:14:00,376," It's from 1993, this rock group was in search of a new vocal and found the singer of this voice. Whom made a one demo recording only but sadly died the very next day in auto accident. When the album was released in tape, exact recording demo was used too. Song became extremely popular and is one of the all time hit song.  Yes I know this is in Korean but regardless of the language, music is music, right? Nah~ who am a kidding, like many? most? of you I just can not stand listening to noise? i mean music of certain language/culture. hehe"
502901,goteeboy,2010-09-10 10:49:00,175, Great choice. have you seen the live pink pop version.  it's incredible.

503002,Spiel,2010-09-10 17:11:00,9065," Good choice Dan, AIC rules.  While Layne is certainly long gone I like the sound of the new AIC album, still has that AIC feel to it, no doubt in part due to Jerry's contribution to their sound and style.  "
503005,blaque,2010-09-10 18:15:00,2419, THey sure have done a great job of keeping their sound intact without layne. Recorded anyway...........i havent seen them live since layne.
503009,Rod Caster,2010-09-10 18:28:00,5784, AIC definitly pulled off a good album minus Layne. Blind Melon's new album without Shannon Hoon is also a hit!

502477,Guest Johnny Bass,2010-09-08 23:31:00,0, That focus band was pretty good. Especially the lead guitarist(reminds me of a young Steve Harris from Iron Maiden) but the vocalists got to go.lol
