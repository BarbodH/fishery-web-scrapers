502836,Another Canadian,2010-09-10 02:01:00,41,"Hi Pigeontroller,  I had one installed by the mechanic who looks after my boat about 4 years ago.  I needed the extra 18 or so inches to allow my boat to fit into the garage of the house I bought.  So far, no issues and happy with it.  The only thing I did was buy a 5' extension for the 4pin trailer wire and wrapped it with a plastic wire cover to avoid getting it pinched or worn.  He said it was a pretty easy job and the kit included everything that was needed. He said the hardest part was cutting the tongue off the trailer square and straight(sawzall), everything else just bolted up.  Then again, I didn't do it either.  For me, it was worth the money.  Bill"

502900,goteeboy,2010-09-10 10:45:00,175,"i installed one last year. it is awesome.  installation.  How's it go again?  Cut twice, measure once?  haha.  read all the instructions carefully.  tip.  invest in or borrow a torque wrench.  a regular socket wrench is too short and made my job way too difficult.  consider placement carefully as the safety chains have to be on trailer and not the foldaway part.  and most importantly be careful not to cut the wire that runs through the trailer.  Cut about 2/3 of the way down and then stick a thin piece of plastic in the cut to lift up the wire above the blade.  other than that it works like a charm."
