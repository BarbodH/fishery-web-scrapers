Our local Red Hat chapter decided on this ""all-girls"" trip.  It will be my first one, - and I can't wait!  -------------------------------------------------------------- DEAR DIARY - DAY 2  Entire day at sea, beautiful.  Saw whales and dolphins.  Met the Captain today -- seems like a very nice man.  -------------------------------------------------------------- DEAR DIARY - DAY 3  At the pool today.  Did some shuffleboard, hit golf balls off the deck. Captain invited me to join him at his table for dinner.  Felt honored and had a wonderful time.  He is very attractive and attentive. ---------------------------------------------------------- DEAR DIARY - DAY 4     Won $800.00 in the ship's casino.  Captain asked me to have dinner with him in his own cabin. Had a scrumptious meal complete with caviar and champagne.  He asked me to stay the night, but I declined.  Told him I could not be unfaithful to my husband.  -------------------------------------------------------------- DEAR DIARY - DAY 5  Pool again today. Got sunburned, and I went inside to drink at piano-bar, stayed there for rest of day.  Captain saw me, bought me several large drinks. Really is quite charming.  Again asked me to visit his cabin for the night.  Again I declined.  He told me, if I did not let him have his way with me, he would sink the ship...  I was shocked.  -------------------------------------------------------------- DEAR DIARY - DAY 6  Today I saved 1600 lives.    Twice."
