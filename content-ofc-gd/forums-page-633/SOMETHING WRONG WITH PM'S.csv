I was told by a couple of people that they sent PMs for different things and I havent received any in the last 3 days or so.  So If I havent responded to you about getting together about fishing this past weekend or the gear hat I am selling, I am sorry. I didnt get the message..  Please resend it if you like...  All the best DAVE"
