824102,DRIFTER_016,2013-12-13 22:31:00,10439,Was talking to a fella as I was walking down town to the post office to pick up my mail. He said the windchill when he left the bar early this morning was -59C!!!!! That's -74.2F for our Merican friends!!!
824109,aplumma,2013-12-13 23:00:00,6896,Wind chill is a myth made up by man to exaggerate cold weather. lol  I actually can do weather both warm and cold but I try to avoid outdoors when the hair in my nose freezes when I breath. Now let it get up into 90s F plus and I am good all day long. Good luck with the cold cold cold weather.   Art

823958,Ron,2013-12-13 00:35:00,1683,"In the heyday of sailing ships, all war ships and many freighters carried iron cannons. Those cannon fired round iron cannon balls. It was necessary to keep a good supply near the cannon. But how to prevent them from rolling about the deck? The best storage method devised was a square based pyramid with one ball on top, resting on four resting on nine which rested on sixteen. Thus, a supply of thirty cannon balls could be stacked in a small area right next to the cannon. There was only one problem -- how to prevent the bottom layer from sliding/rolling from under the others. The solution was a metal plate called a ""Monkey"" with sixteen round indentations. But, if this plate was made of iron, the iron balls would quickly rust to it. The solution to the rusting problem was to make ""Brass Monkeys."" Few landlubbers realize that brass contracts much more and much faster than iron when chilled. Consequently, when the temperature dropped too far, the brass indentations would shrink so much that the iron cannon balls would come right off the monkey. Thus, it was quite literally, ""Cold enough to freeze the balls off a brass monkey!"""
