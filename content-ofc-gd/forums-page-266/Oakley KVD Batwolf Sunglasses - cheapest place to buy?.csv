824484,MSBruno,2013-12-16 02:30:00,369,Looking to buy these and it seems Oakley is pretty rigid in their pricing with their retailers.  Anyone have any luck getting these Oakleys sub-$200?
824490,Richie Razor,2013-12-16 02:52:00,536,"Probably the Oakley vault? I used to deal with Oakley professionally and yes they protect their brand like it's they're first born. Unless you want to buy knockoffs, the polarized fishing specific oakley's are never less than $200. Try online or driving to the good ol' US of A."
824544,MSBruno,2013-12-16 14:23:00,369,The vault is still charging full MSRP.  Online and in the US shows the same.
824546,ciceri,2013-12-16 14:32:00,535,Black Friday or Cyber Monday would've been your best bet.
824547,Richie Razor,2013-12-16 14:44:00,536,Then I guess you have to suck it up and pay in full like the rest of us. Lol

824590,bigmac1984,2013-12-16 18:49:00,193,Do they have some kind of exchange program on right now?
824767,MSBruno,2013-12-17 03:03:00,369,Do they have some kind of exchange program on right now? Not sure.  I called and complained about my broken Revo's and they offered the deal.
