824353,Old Ironmaker,2013-12-15 03:33:00,8243,"In 1986 our new build neighborhood had a central mailbox in Stoney Creek. This isn't something new. I had a bar where the posties from downtown Hamilton came in at noon at the end of their shift. There is 173.33 hours in an employment month, 2080 annually, do the math, the hourly rate is very high. If a postie makes 40K a year ( I have no idea the wage) and works 4 hours a day that's $38.46 an hour, not bad.  A new member here Garzy something is someone obviously very close to the posties. He has some good points, some I wasn't aware of. But he said Harper is trying to get in part time uneducated individuals with ""low morals"". What in hells name does education have to do with morals. That's how someone that has something good to say looses me. Keep to the facts man, or lady.  There was a time that good workers used horses to deliver block ice to your home. And the guy that came down the street in a cart, in my lifetime, sharpening knives, or a steelworker that could put 30 years in hell in a plant working every holiday and weekend and come out with a pension, maybe, they survived somehow.  Time to accept the future and the future is now."

Lets go shipper boys/gals, make us some money and a good return on our investment!! And I hope you get a good pension in return.  It's not about Harper or Trudeau or whatever who cares... as long as we as Canadians don't sell low and buy high on anything."

No true education for our children, a green plan that is failing miserably, horrible health care and the attempted forced extinction of the middle class man or woman. Time for change.  Pssssst...you can blame the union and their unwillingness to sacrifice extremely overpaid jobs for the Kellogg's plant closing. It has nothing to do with the government and everything to do with the fact that Kellogg's wanted to cut less than 1/4 of the jobs at the factory to save the rest and the union workers refused. The result is closed doors thanks to the union workers not willing to make sacrifices to cut operating costs.  Pretty much every time you hear of a factory or business closing up these days it's union run. Coincidence?       I've always had door to door mail delivery so it will be a big change for me, but it's not really a big deal. Who is going to be paying for all these mail boxes that will need to be built, installed, and maintained?"
824081,Bill Shearer,2013-12-13 20:33:00,456,"After the postal strike was over, CP got rid of all the grey metal mail route boxes in our area. They held the mail for the carrier that did the 'to the door deliveries'. It was the drop box, so to speak.  One large van would deliver the mail each day to those boxes. Then with all the money they saved during the strike, and probably a lot more to boot, they bought each carrier, one of the small Ford tradesman vans, that are made in Turkey. Makes sense right? They are now the grey boxes with wheels..lol Now in 5 years or less those vehicles will be toast, as well as the folks that drove them. And they can then buy 'super boxes' for us, all in the name of saving money. The biggest question I have is 'will putting the price of a stamp up to $1, cover the costs of the pensions/packages for those 5000-8000 people that will be retiring/leaving? I don't think so. I've had to the door delivery for the last 35 years. I will miss it, and the good folks that brought it!"
824181,cram,2013-12-14 04:30:00,1733,"Maybe it's me, but why not just deliver the mail once or twice a week?  Why do we need it every day?"

Population density would play a role.  The U.S.A. has 10 times the population in a smaller area.  I am sure that Canada Post makes a nice profit when someone delivers from one down town Toronto address to another down town Toronto address, maybe even Toronto to Vancouver; but then they have to deliver from Labrador to Nunavut or to the Yukon for the same price.

823739,jedimaster,2013-12-11 23:47:00,3472,Orangeville 1989 super box for mail. Shocked people still even get door to door service.
823740,crappieperchhunter,2013-12-11 23:50:00,2582,We moved into our brand new house in Dec of 1988 here in Oshawa and already had a super box then.
823741,lew,2013-12-11 23:54:00,12766,I have to travel 1.5 miles out to the hiway to get mine so it makes no difference to me either.
823743,Rich,2013-12-11 23:58:00,3927,How much will taxes go down from all the money saved?
823747,Richie Razor,2013-12-12 00:02:00,536,"Wow I can't believe they still deliver door to door,'I'm assuming it mostly rural? As mentioned the 'burbs have been getting centralized neighbourhood mailing since the late 80's, so it's a shock to me that some still get their junk mail personally delivered.  Door to door mail delivery is extremely inefficient and with all the rising costs these days, it's really about time they cut off this service. After all 95% of the stuff you get from c-post is garbage ads anyways. How about they stop mailing me junk?!?!?"
823750,tb4me,2013-12-12 00:08:00,3295,I still get my mail delivered right to my door and im gonna miss it. Having said that its no big deal..I just kind of find it sad.But the 37% price increase quickly changes my mine..This is the official death of Canada post..
823751,Fisherman,2013-12-12 00:14:00,7201,"I have to travel 1.5 miles out to the hiway to get mine so it makes no difference to me either. And I'll bet you had to walk uphill both ways eh Lew, no boots only stocking feet...just pulling yer hose.. Honestly, at least you don't have to worry about the mailman tromping through the flowers."
823752,gardzy99,2013-12-12 00:16:00,7,"Canada Post has never used taxpayers dollars. They are self sufficient, meaning they operate solely on their income provided by their services. This is why I think people should be more upset than what they are. The corporation lets the public believe they are taxed based (lies). They let the public think they are hurting. Yes letters are down, but every other type of mail is up ASTRONOMICALLY.....packages, magazines, addressed admail, admail etc. They are only losing money based against their forecasted projections which they set high to enforce their lies. I realize people do not like unions. I understand that people do not use Canada Post. BUT, why voice your opinion on the subject if it does not affect you. Think of the millions of Canadians who rely on Canada Post for employment. These are good jobs being lost because of a persons opinion of something they do not use. Yes Canada Post needed to change, but these are jobs for todays people, tomorrows children and beyond. And the trickle effect will also be felt nation wide.....small businesses including taxi services, local Urban Large delivery businesses, printers and packers......All of these jobs will be lost due to these changes enforced by people who do not use the service and therefore do not pay a cent for it, because THEY DO NOT USE THE TAXPAYERS MONEY......I find this truly upsetting and very Un-Canadian. We should be wanting these jobs in our communities. We should be protecting the work force that Mr. Harper is so evidently trying to change into a part time economy with lower education morals and a really hurting medical system as well. I for one oppose these changes in the name of the hard working people of Canada Post......"
823753,Ralph Field,2013-12-12 00:19:00,1018,"I hate to see this, since I still get home delivery. The cost of a stamp going up to a dollar is bad and perhaps the cancellation of home delivery is suppose to make this more acceptable."
823756,woodenboater,2013-12-12 00:30:00,2277,so I wonder if the flyer people will make a big stink as that was also a revenue stream for CanPost. I'm thinking this might be a trial balloon...
823758,leaf4,2013-12-12 00:41:00,2466,"pretty well everywhere in hamilton, sans new builds has door to door I wouldn't care either way"
823759,cram,2013-12-12 00:50:00,1733,"I get home delivery (and am in a town/city).  Will miss it, and feel bad for my mailman.  $1 to have something delivered across the country, usually in a couple of days.....doesn't seem like a bad deal to me."
823760,Salmonidstalker,2013-12-12 00:50:00,265,"I know someone who delivers for canada post. What Canada post deems to be his 8 hour schedule, he finishes in 4. Not even kidding, so there you go."
823764,BillM,2013-12-12 01:27:00,17367,"No big deal.  If it doesn't fit in the box, I'll pick it up at the local Shoppers Drug Mart."
823767,Handlebarz,2013-12-12 01:31:00,3790,Well I'm sure the next cuts will be the post office and they will all or most move into shopper drug stores. The postal workers earn around $25/hr the shoppers postal workers $11-$15 depending on the stores that is a huge savings.
823769,crappieperchhunter,2013-12-12 01:42:00,2582,It is a company that is cutting out a part of there business that is losing them money.  Although I feel for anybody who loses there job over this. It is what it is.  They are doing what is best for the company and have every right to do so.  Blame the internet. I haven't sent a letter to anyone for any reason for a long long time. The money I used to spend on Canada Post I now spend monthly to have internet service. It's not my fault technology is putting posties out of work. It's the evolution of how we communicate....plain and simple.
823770,Entropy,2013-12-12 01:43:00,747,"Some near me have end of driveway mailboxes, C-Post will not deliver down my road.  And when I ask about a nearby supper box, I'm told I do not live in the area (this makes now sense at all).  F-it, I only pick up the mail once a week at the local post office, when the newspapers go out.  I wouldn't mind once or twice a week deliver by C-post.  Heck I think during the strike at the local post office they only had mail coming in twice a week, might still be that way, who knows.  The whole Shoppers Drug Mart thing bothers me.  I'd rather have 'real live' post offices.  Entropy"
