824554,limeyangler,2013-12-16 15:39:00,5204,"Hi all,  Finally got out on the ice, it was around -28C, lucky there was no wind.      Arrived at around 2:30pm           Put only one on the ice and missed a whole bunch            Froze our behinds off till the bitter end, would do it again in a heartbeat!        The slush out there was horrendous….REALLY BAD….my buddy got stuck before we had wet a line. Missed a couple of big ones….and littler ones…..line freeze/stuck bail arms/bad luck etc…etc..   Got stopped by a CO on the way out, good guy named Colin, he had a hard time believing we only had 1 fish to take home, but he knows us pretty well and took our word for it without searching (probably to cold to be bothered more like…lol).  Never been that much of a fan of walleye fishing in the winter, but was awesome to get out after almost 4 weeks of elbow rehab!!!!   Tight lines all."
