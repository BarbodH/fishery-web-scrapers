824007,Rich,2013-12-13 10:03:00,3927,"I've always watched my dad and grandpa fillet fish, pretty well from birth! I feel it's important to learn the process of how food gets to the table in its bare basic form. Something all humans should be practicing to shift their perceptions, IMO!"
824012,muskymatt,2013-12-13 12:33:00,2608,"My two daughters were exposed to fishing as soon as they could hold a rod. They were also exposed to every other aspect of fishing at the same time, including; bonking, cleaning, disposal of the guts, cooking , and eating.  My older daughter used to think it was neat to feel the guts and rub some of the blood on her fingers. Her mom and I used to think maybe she had some morbid tendencies, but she grew out of it.  So from a young age they baited and removed their own fish from the hooks, harvested their catch and helped clean and prep for eating.  I hope they pass it on to their kids (when that time comes) with the help of Grandpa, or at least not object to me showing their kids what I did for them."
824022,porkpie,2013-12-13 13:53:00,2521,"My boys have been watching or helping since they where 2.  Never been an issue, go for it!"
824043,ch312,2013-12-13 16:56:00,1590,"All kids should know how the food gets to their plates! My 3 help or watch with everything from chickens, deer, bear, bullfrogs, squirrels, ducks, geese, rabbits and fish. They love to eat it all too.  THIS!  We have a 7 month old boy and he will be learning about our various food sources at a young age, including the harvesting and processing of animals. Teaching them why we (hunters, fishermen, butchers, etc) kill animals also teaches them respect for living creatures along with what death is and if you kill something it's gone forever. Older children really benefit from seeing animals being processed as it's an introduction to anatomy and the majority are very curious and willing to learn.  It drives me insane when some parents do everything in their power to ""protect"" their kids from learning about death and where meat comes from while making them believe that meat is simply made in the back of the grocery store or mcdonalds."
824062,msp,2013-12-13 19:31:00,1336,"Cool thread guys. My daughters now 14 and 12 used to love scaping roe off the skein. They used to be great helpers.

824163,Richie Razor,2013-12-14 01:10:00,536,"No offense to any of your family members, but when I was a teen the only vegans I knew were so because of their culture/religion. These days the trend is to skip meat, because all the celebs are doing so. What's wrong with the kids these days?!?!?  I'd say your all excellent parents for not sheltering your kids from something as primal as cleaning fish. And when my boy is old enough to know what's going on you can bet he'll be elbows deep in fish guts with his old man. Lol"
824165,kickingfrog,2013-12-14 01:13:00,8333,Another aspect to consider that I've noticed in my limited experience with my kids. It's not always a straight line from one experience to another. Introducing them to things at as young a age as possible is a good idea but don't be surprised if at some later age something that they were completely fascinated by now disgusts them.
823845,rbaquial,2013-12-12 14:49:00,968,"Hi Everyone,  About 2yrs ago, I became father for the 1st time - BEST FEELING IN THE WORLD. Anyway, I've always been an avid fisherman (even well before I got married) ...  Now that I have a 2yr old daughter - I'm curious on how some parents out there go about intoducing 'harvesting' of fish to their toddlers?  I'm loving the idea of introducing Fishing to my Daughter - I just don't know how to go about this - I mean....its a lot to think about... How do you go about it??  Any help I can get from all the parents out there would be greatly appreciated,  Thanks in Advance, A2F "
823848,bigugli,2013-12-12 15:07:00,6138,"Initially, I did the ""harvesting"" out of sight of my kids. My wife is also very squeamish on the subject. At an early age it's OK to let a child know, after dinner, the fish they caught were what they had for supper. Let them know they are going out to catch some supper. At 4 my son was having his first whacks on the fish's head. Kids have a natural curiosity to see what is going on. Gutting a fish becomes a science class in dissection"
823852,BillM,2013-12-12 15:19:00,17367,"I loved watching my dad clean fish when I was little, loved it!   Still do actually, lol.   Don't make a big deal out it and they won't think it's abnormal."
823856,manitoubass2,2013-12-12 15:35:00,11391,"Im with bill, my kids have watched me right from the time tey could walk. As they got older and had ther own interest in fishing, they were very proud to catch keepers and provide a lovely meal. They always watch keenly over me now, wanting to know what they caught had eaten. Now my ildest boy and girl are starting to fillete on their own, supervised of course. They're 11 and 13"
823857,quickme,2013-12-12 15:38:00,261,"I have 2 boys 6 and 4.   In the beginning I would clean the fish and fry it up for them.   I made this a special moment with them as it was a treat to have Fresh fish.  I told them its not easy to catch fish and it took work and patience.  When I asked if they wanted to come and fish with them they screamed ""YEAH"" ( very proud daddy moment).  When we got out on the water I told them that they can help catch dinner and we'll cook their catch.   This is where I taught them not to keep the very little ones and not to keep the very big ones ( did have that conversation to much later).   They looked at fish as a food source but knew that they were living creatures.   They haven't help me clean them yet as they are still too little but they will watch.  I teach them the anatomy of the fish and how it works.  They always like seeing what the fish ate, as did I when I was a kid and my dad did the same thing.  Ease your daughter into it.  Don't just show her fish guts and fish heads.  If she understands that its a food source she'll accept the process it takes to put it on the table.   nick"

For me, as long as I can remember, I was Always trying to catch a meal.  If I didn't come home with a fish for dinner, my grandparents would tease me!!!  My son is 15 months.  He watched me clean crappie last weekend.  Then eat some with me after it was cooked."

When I'm cleaning fish the like nothing better than to be elbow deep in guts. My 6 year old is self sufficient in the catching dept. ties his own lures, baits, casts and retrieves. My 4 year old still needs help tying the hook. My 6 year old was starting to fillet fish this fall and I hope for him to get more practice over this winter. These are from a couple years back.    In Newfoundland we call these peas....cod roe sacks   Wrinkles....sea snails    Can't forget the rabbits. If they'll put up with that smell they'll clean any animal.

823872,Moosebunk,2013-12-12 16:59:00,3970,"Summer's first harvests fishing involved her.  We would walk Store Creek in Moosonee and catch small specks.  To keep moving without the fish I would hide them under bark or leaves and ask her to remember where they were on the way back home.  I'd slow the pace nearing our stocks and ask her if we forgot anything, or if we're close to our fish.  She loved being responsible for finding them... more than reeling them in.  They were her Easter eggs and back home I would cook them in the pan only gutted.  They were her snacks she got to share, and share she did.  Only went that way a few years but the process of catching and harvesting fish took early roots in a good way.  When I come home now with fish and put them in the sink, even as a teen she's curious to drop what she's doing and have a look at the catch.  Leah fell into it because she's just curious about everything.  Wants to see all the inards, touch the fish, talk about it, watch them cook, understand the process, and if she can go with Dad fishing to get them.  After every time I get back from fishing, if she's home, she comes to the garage and asks (yells out) the same questions.  How was your fishing?  Did you catch any fish?  Did you bring any home?  She's like a broken record that has been playing that same tune for years now.  No matter what about harvest and fishing the main thing with kids is, they need to see you're happy and that it's being done right, and that in some good way they are very much a part of it."
823875,Lunkerhunter,2013-12-12 17:13:00,455,great thread. my daughter just turned one and my wife is a vegetarian. I was wondering how i was going to go about teaching my daughter how to fillet fish especially when her mother cant even be in the same room.  my wife wont keep any fish but has no problem with me keeping my limit. i eat fresh fish pretty much weekly so its always in front of her she just pretends it doesnt happen. hahaha

In the spring my 2 year old daughter was the best plate holder and fillet washer I've ever had, and has no problem playing with the worms. Heck she even helps carry ducks and geese from the vehicle to the cleaning spot. Large game too for both kids.  Judge by her reaction and willingness to help, she will let you know when she is grossed out or not. And ensure you demonstrate and speak to the respect for animals while harvesting and cleaning.

I would stand on the dock with my gear to cast and both my kids (now 7 and 10) would ask (and still do!) if they could fish too.  Kids do like to do what mom and or dad are doing if it looks like fun.  And yes, my kids have seen me filet a fish many a time and still like to be a part of it.  More so if it's a fish they caught.  They devour the meal if they caught it."

Let curiosity do its thing, and whatever you do, dont be afraid to let them get some blood on their hands!
