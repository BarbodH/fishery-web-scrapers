So you're telling me that fishing stories and rumors were saying that a fish was bigger than it actually was? Isn't that how every fishing story goes?"
824040,Muskieman,2013-12-13 16:35:00,2472,seems that way sometimes eh ?
824041,Raf,2013-12-13 16:36:00,3495,"this is a different story and unrelated to the 59"" in other posts  these are IGFA records now nobody has really bothered with.  the current record is small and much bigger fish are caught annually nobody bothers submitting to the IGFA"
824051,Muskieman,2013-12-13 17:53:00,2472,now that's an answer that makes sense ..
824414,cowanjo,2013-12-15 18:05:00,249,IGFA for reference sells a $75 Tool to measure etc to allow certification - this is in my opinion a nonsense record to make money and why no one cares. Feels like we are starting to get seven different boxing and wrestling federations.  Nice fish however and no one should doubt the slobs caught great job

They are 52 inch fish that look huge. Can't wait to see picture of rumoured 59 by 34 inch it must look massive. lol"
824507,Old Ironmaker,2013-12-16 05:16:00,8243,"The scrutiny and doubt from the public that comes with applying for a world record fish would be enough for me to keep my mouth shut if I was ever lucky enough to catch one. It's not like it comes with a 6 figure cheque, or maybe it does through endorsements.  I can hear the conversation, ""what line did you catch it on?"" How much is it worth if I told you it was your brand?"
