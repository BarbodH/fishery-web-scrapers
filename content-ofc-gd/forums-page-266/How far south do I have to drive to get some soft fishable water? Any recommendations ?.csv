824489,Shloim,2013-12-16 02:52:00,515,Looking for a possible vacation away from the cold. Doesn't need to Florida weather but need family attractions and some fishing....
824491,Richie Razor,2013-12-16 02:53:00,536,Myrtle beach?
824493,Shloim,2013-12-16 02:56:00,515,That far huh?
824505,Old Ironmaker,2013-12-16 05:04:00,8243,"It's 2C right now there in Myrtle Beach. High of 16 tomorrow. Not much for the family to do down there this time of year. They pretty well roll up the sidewalks after labour day. We've seen snow there in October. Florida is your best bet. Good bass all year in Alabama and Louisiana. Or the lower Niagara. Good fishing in December I hear, not for me. Still lots to do for the family now. The Festival of Lights is a must see in the winter.  Depend on how far is far?, you could be in Wawa, Niagara Falls is far for me driving from Wawa."

824527,Garnet,2013-12-16 12:10:00,2056,Myrtle Beach or Florida not much difference in driving time.
824530,Shloim,2013-12-16 12:20:00,515,So it's much like I thought... I was hoping for a hidden gem I suppose... What's everyone else's holiday plans?
824660,fishdawg,2013-12-16 23:15:00,912,I recall Craig Ritchie sharing here before about Tennesse offering good open water angling in the winter...
824662,aplumma,2013-12-16 23:22:00,6896,We still have soft water as close as Virginia however the fishing is very slow to the point of not worth getting the boat wet. If I wanted to fish and be comfortable and know the fish are biting I would head down to Louisiana or further.   Art
824684,mike rousseau,2013-12-17 00:04:00,4661,Cornwall Ontario.... Lol  Still open water and ramp....  Been out 2 of the past 3 winters in Jan Feb March....  And always caught fish....
