752761,Steve,2012-12-18 00:38:00,2075,"i'm not familiar with your handicap/current challenge, however, I have a ""little bit"" larger 17' tiller that I can access that location during the winter.  i'd love to have you join me."
752776,Cookslav,2012-12-18 01:06:00,1457,I always looked forward to these reports of yours. The Brownies were always a favorite... That and The idea of a 12' Tinner in Lake O. in the dead of winter....that takes stones my friend
752827,ehg,2012-12-18 03:04:00,2666," You are right Wayne. i am using forearm crutches. Seeing the ""Karma Three Way street"" thread of your daughters tribulations has made me think that getting out fishing there might be possible if i muster up her strength and will.    Good stuff MoB! Nice to see others being rewarded for the efforts involved with getting out there. Because of disability went from beach to Frenchman's eventually. Now even that isn't possible but...  Thanks Jacques, last time out there was March of 2010.   Thanks Steve, I have multiple sclerosis complicated by a disk herniation. The pics were i am wearing black hoodie i had just MS then. The back thing really screwed up ability to get out in 12 ft. tinny. Getting out in 17 ft boat might be able to be done. I could show you the ropes there. Will PM you soon.  Thanks fellow chef. Was confident i would be alright but found out this summer i can't move legs to swim. Falling out of tinny would be real bad news.  Again, thanks for replies! Still love fishing."
752835,Steve,2012-12-18 03:40:00,2075,"ok, let me know. offer's open any time.  if it ""can"" be done, I'll do my best to help it get done."
752839,ehg,2012-12-18 03:49:00,2666, Again thanks Steve. Did spend time at Algonquin Park this summer fishing. http://ontariofishingcommunity.com/forums/index.php?showtopic=64097   Should be able to get out with you in your boat.
753071,MJL,2012-12-18 23:50:00,2427,Awesome Erik...Really nice browns  It's been many years since I caught a white bass. I remember having tons of fun fishing for them with my dad as a kid.  Thanks for the report
754641,ehg,2012-12-27 19:37:00,2666,Received some PM's about this post and location.  Thought i would bump this for fish eye candy from this time of year.  Wives with time off to take care of kids at Christmas break and March break made it easier to get out there then. LOL
754730,Toad Hunter,2012-12-28 04:34:00,261,"posting a pic of OOS Bass ?? Brave man, must have powerful friends on here to do that with out worry...I've seen mobs rip guys new ones on here for less  really nice pics. though--fish porn always helps me get through the hard water season (haven't ice fished in years). My lil one is due in 4 days, I'm hoping that gives the mrs. a few months to ""get over it"" and let me go fishing ?? :whistling:jk. But man I hope I can get out more this year than last years sad excuse for attempts"
754743,johnnyb,2012-12-28 12:53:00,3413,"Simply a fantastic post.....gotta hand it to you, that is impressive"
824024,ehg,2013-12-13 14:18:00,2666,"Keep seeing this video/commercial which reminds me that it is that time of year again Main difference being around Toronto was pure industrial setting and no shore fishing allowed. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=imDmzevcTIs  Should have been a meteorologist as studying weather maps and watching future wind direction was done in winter for decades. Did have a couple PM's asking about this recently. If you read this thread info is all there.  Sometime used a few dozen emerald shiners off slip floats, that worked well too. Have to be there at sunrise or sunset for the non stop catching. Sunlight sends the fish to the expansive depths of big lake.  Hard to believe was half hour from downtown T.O. Good for hardcore anglers who like catching. Always thought a Canadian record white bass or walleye was possibility."

Thank You EHG SO MUCH for posting thisIn all the years of boat ownership, i never even bothered to get out here until later this October, and it is one of GTA's hidden Gems.  Any other boat anglers wanting to take a whack at this spot anytime of the year (except winter) are more than welcome to P.M me, and set up a trip.  Thanks Again EHG"

This morning is a perfect example of right conditions to try fishing this spot. Light northerly winds staying offshore all day.  Tinnys off lake shore Frencmans Bay beach. Large boats have to launch from Bluffers Park and do short run.  Key thing is to arrive at sunrise or sunset for non stop doubleheaders of mixed species for few hours before you freeze or fish scatter."
751636,ehg,2012-12-13 20:51:00,2666,"Sure liked going fishing. Once the winter came it was slim pickings. Bay of Quinte wasn't bad for walleye through ice. The walk on ice to spot wasn't far but didn't enjoy the drive down there There was a place within half hour of downtown T.O. The softwater fishing was good.  Decided to do this post with some trepidation. Element of danger was high. Since going out on Lake Ontario in 12 ft. tinny was necessary everything had to checkout. The wind and weather was scrutinized.  The wind had to be from north and light. Any other direction and the excursion would be cancelled. Northeast, east, southeast, south,southwest and west would all be deadly. Lowered tinny down small shoreline cliff to shorten distance to destination to few hundred meters. Lifejackets or floatsuits were worn  when in motion but usually removed in pictures for casting freedom.  Some winters might have been able to get out once or twice. Some winters a dozen times,depending on weathher conditions.  Started doing this in mid-90's before digital cameras so some nice fish pictures aren't available. Did catch mostly brown trout, white bass, smallmouth bass, rainbows but even caught chinooks, carp, walleye, sheepshead, and rare pike.  Only two types of lures were used, Rattlin Raps and jointed shad raps. Would only go pre-dawn by 9 am fish would stop hitting.    Since i am now disabled this fishing is out for me but it is nice to remember through pics what was the best until a couple of winters ago. My buddy Dave was talking about how great this was other day so i did this post.  Caught tons of these brown trout...   It was cold...         Even caught walleye out there...        Tons of biggest white bass in world, my favourite...        Even carp hit lures ...        Lots of freshwater drum (sheepshead)...didn't want pics really.     Caught these the most... out of season at time.    Sign behind me me sums this place up.     Some other species were caught there rainbows, shad, nothing remarkable. Anyways, thought i would post some pics from past, Seems not much fishing going on these days.  Cheers, ehg"

751639,jimmer,2012-12-13 21:18:00,2730,"Thanks for sharing. I probably fished that area in the early 80's, but nothing ever stays the same. Great pictures."
751642,mistaredone,2012-12-13 21:30:00,913,Awesome!!
751645,EC1,2012-12-13 21:34:00,930,I could use a fix of this so badly! Only problem is that the wind the last few years are really just ridiculous! Thanks for sharing.
751648,lew,2012-12-13 21:40:00,12766,"I always enjoyed your winter fishing tales Eric and it's a shame you can't get out there anymore, but you've sure got alot of good time memories.  I remember one big chunky pike you got out there a few years back but you didn't put the picture up this time."
751664,ehg,2012-12-13 22:50:00,2666," Thanks Lew, i was doing little reports from there back on all the different versions of board going back almost a decade ago. Too many pictures to sort through and post so tried to keep it short. Despite the danger, thoroughly enjoyed getting out on the water."
751677,fishindevil,2012-12-13 23:52:00,6254,Eric those were the days I miss fishing that place did it way back from about 1983 right up till when the Gagnons sports murders in Oshawa in 94 I was shore fishing the outflow the day they found ken Thomas body down there off the walking trail !!!! It was closed just shortly after that permanently !!! I thing you and I met out there in our boats one day !!!! We had days like you a lot 10 browns a day and silver bass some days we would catch 100 of them !!!! Walleyes were always a hot bite in febuary browns in November and December ya back before digital cameras and phones I hae old pics too it was nice to fish open water all winter and catch lots of fish every time !!!!! Ahhhh the memories !!! Thanks for sharing eric
751678,fishindevil,2012-12-13 23:54:00,6254,My biggest brown I caught down there was almost 20lbs !! And the silver bass were huge too I'm gonna try to find some pics
751693,Joeytier,2012-12-14 00:46:00,3990,"Had some very frightening times out there over the years, but also produced a lot of amazing fishing tales and lifelong memories.  I believe my first fish was a sheepshead from there.  The whities are a blast when they're on!"
751753,ehg,2012-12-14 12:29:00,2666, I went there and fished on shore in 80's as well but once they closed access due to murder the fishing from boat was way better. Only a few boats made for more space.  The amazing thing was the incredible fishing/catching within half hour of downtown Toronto. Great for the hardcore fishermen.
751769,Moosebunk,2012-12-14 13:59:00,3970,"Solid post Eric.  Certainly some great memories for you, and thanks for sharing a little with us.  Some of those browns and white bass are just incredible dood."
751775,Rod Caster,2012-12-14 14:30:00,5784,I really enjoy a white-bass meal! It sure looks cold out there... But a GREAT post for sure!
751817,JoshS,2012-12-14 18:15:00,729,"Awesome post, thanks for sharing this. I've been trying to get out for the last few weeks on my days off but the weather hasn't cooperated.Some amazing memories you've accumulated there for sure."
752023,ehg,2012-12-15 16:16:00,2666, I checked white bass records at time and these fish were close. The browns were abundant. All species there had possibility of hitting record size.     Never kept or ate a thing from there. Did keep and eat walleye from Quinte. These fish probably had same consumption value.
752043,Toronto_Angler,2012-12-15 17:31:00,698,Thanks EHG. Used to always look forward to your winter fishing reports. Like watching a fishing adventure show lol
752060,Spiel,2012-12-15 19:01:00,9065,Excellent recount of better days Erik.  I'm saddened to think that those days may never again be in your future.  Always enjoyed your big water winter posts and I truly hope we'll see some more in time even if they are less adventurous.
752141,esoxansteel,2012-12-16 01:23:00,1307,"Thanx for posting Eric, never fished there, but always wanted to, did fish the Hearn in the days, and the Lakeview as well in the early 80s, i do remember your posts and enjoyed every one of them."
752144,Musky or Specks,2012-12-16 01:43:00,2710,Thanks for the report brought back memories of fishing Bruce Nuke. Sucks that you can't fish there anymore.
752160,Hooked,2012-12-16 03:43:00,891,"I remember you posting outings like that...loved them!!!  Infact I still talk about the white bass you would catch, they were huge!  Not to mind the variety of other fish you would catch!  Good times to remember.  Thanks for sharing again and very sorry that it is no longer possible for you to do outings like that anymore."
752161,irishfield,2012-12-16 03:45:00,26272,A trip down memory lane Erik... great for us all from time to time!! THANKS!
752252,ehg,2012-12-16 16:08:00,2666,    Thought i would add few more decent pictures. Hard to believe this was so close to T.O.
752253,ehg,2012-12-16 16:08:00,2666,         Thanks for such positive replies! I am pleased that the past posts were well received. Really helped break the winternet doldrums.  The best fishing ever half hour from Toronto!
752277,Master of Bait,2012-12-16 16:50:00,196,"Awesome EHG.  Can't say enough about that place.  I did basically the exact same thing as you (tinny, down the bank, watching the weather, etc. - actually, even focused on the jointed shads as well!).  I often found myself questioning my sanity out there - but then I'd hook into something huge and it all made sense.  Here are a few pics.  I'm leaving out my infamous ""Atlantic"" salmon from a few years back to ensure that debate does not rear its head again - HA!  Thanks for sharing memories from a great fishing hole in the GTA.  Cheers,  MoB    "
752731,Leecher,2012-12-18 00:01:00,7832,Memories of a life time for you Erik   Appreciate you sharing those with us I especially loved the pics of the browns   I remember seeing them not too long ago  Great fishery you have down by the GTA Again thanks for sharing mon ami
