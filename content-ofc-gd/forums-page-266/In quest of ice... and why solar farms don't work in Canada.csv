824775,NAW,2013-12-17 03:35:00,4022,Thanks Wayne!!!!
824784,4x4bassin,2013-12-17 05:19:00,1025,"Thanks Irish , love the pictures from above"
824785,Old Ironmaker,2013-12-17 05:30:00,8243,"Beauty pics Wayne, sure looks cold. Flew for a bit trying to get certified in the 70's, needed a good carb de-icer in the old Piper Cherokee 140 way back when.  I'm in Haldimand windfarms and huge solar farms all around. It's the future like it or not. Nana told us of the fear they had in the early 20th century when they started putting up the Hydro and telephone lines in the country, they thought they were going tomfall on them. This was in the late 60's when the huge Hydro line towers were being built along the Red Hill creek area to the lake in east Hamilton. We all played ball along this tract of land since it was severed off. We were all going to get sick, cows in the country were going to give radio active milk, the rumors of them falling and crushing innocent families watching Ed Sullivan in the states were rampant.  They're here and here to stay.  My only question is it 10MW capacity or estimate output based on historic data?  The people certainly profiting are the designers, manufacturers, suppliers, constructors and real estate investors. I say real estate investors not farmers because out here 4 individuals that had the foresight to see this opportunity to rent out the land for solar and wind own a huge amount of acreage here. I say good for them. They could have been stuck with thousands of acres of clay."
824789,Ron,2013-12-17 06:46:00,1683,Always an interesting view from the sky. It is amazing how land marks look so different. I couldn't recognize any of it.
824790,fishindevil,2013-12-17 08:01:00,6254,Awesome pics from the air Wayne !!! Bet it felt good to get away for a bit with all that's been going on !!! Thanks Steve for all the info on the solar panels interesting !!! Cheers & merry xmas
824800,cram,2013-12-17 13:15:00,1733,"Very, very cool pics."
824802,Moosebunk,2013-12-17 13:55:00,3970,"Enjoying a cup of coffee on my cozy morning flight across land and sea.  Cool stuff flight commander Irishfield.  It is some cooooooooooold out there this December.   Interesting stuff about the solar farms.  Have 3/4 acre behind a thin treeline and in open field behind the house here, because it's pretty well out of sight I often wondered if it would be worth it to have 2 or 3 of things?"
824815,Tomcat,2013-12-17 15:39:00,395,Thanks Wayne for sharing pictures of your flight. Very enjoyable especially from that altitude! Just wondering how comfortable it is in your aircraft when flying in such cold temperatures.  Thanks too to Steve for sharing some info on solar power. A couple of the outfitters I know on Lake Kipawa have switched to solar power as their main source of electricity and use their generators as backup now.
824828,irishfield,2013-12-17 17:34:00,26272,"Just dress like you're going ice fishing and all is well Tomcat! lol.. Seriously, I swapped out the exhaust this spring and it appears I have a pretty good heater now and was actually flying bare handed and had my jacket unzipped. The last 18 winters I froze my arse off ...  Best not to have too good of a heater.. my old Cessna 182A's heater was so good that I'd take my jacket off and throw it in the back. Not a good place for it when the ground comes up to smite thee."
824835,aplumma,2013-12-17 18:25:00,6896,Your plane is about as warm as a convertible VW. lol  When Joe and I rebuilt ours we removed and replaced the heater channels that had rusted out and collapsed it was the difference between driveable in the fall and freezing to death.    Art
824848,davey buoy,2013-12-17 20:04:00,5505,"Great pictures Wayne,grew up and boated a lot of those areas in the Geogian Bay .To see it froze up this early is something on it's own."
824895,iFish4real,2013-12-18 00:05:00,386,"man, you have a plane (or planes)   ...do you have a (adult) single daughter ?  :P"
824899,irishfield,2013-12-18 00:21:00,26272,Two... one's taken...  I have less in my airplane than most here have in their boats! Don't get to excited.. I built it myself. The others in the yard... I buy and sell.. makes my expenses legit !
824906,iFish4real,2013-12-18 00:52:00,386,"nice  I guess should be interesting building your own plane, did you get it as a kit ?"
824938,vance,2013-12-18 02:26:00,719,As a none flying aviation enthusiast I would like to know what kind of engine temperature you need to have to take off and as it started fairly easily in cold temps is it carbed or injected.   vance
824941,irishfield,2013-12-18 02:37:00,26272,Updraft carb Vance... = the night of having a blanket over the engine cowl and a 900W heater running below the engine. Generally needs about 2 hours minimum to heat soak the engine... but if I know I'm going out the next day I plug it in the night before and it makes me go no matter how cold. Once heated.. unplugging and not flying = condensation inside the motor which isn't good.  Once you're off flying.. I can drop in on the lake somewhere and fish for 5 or 6 hours with a blanket over the engine cowl and it will fire back up with no issues.    
824942,mike rousseau,2013-12-18 02:41:00,4661,Very cool pics...  My dad is the foreman on the crew installing a solar field here in Cornwall... Big money being spent all over Ontario on these... Already a few in our area...  And...Solar panel still work with snow and ice... They're are transparent after all... Lol... That was by far the coolest looking pic...
824976,Steve,2013-12-18 04:18:00,2075,Does he work for Canadian Solar Mike? (or ABB / WB White?)
824990,mike rousseau,2013-12-18 05:28:00,4661,He's with the electricians union...  Not sure who's paying the bill...
825139,GBW,2013-12-18 23:41:00,8460,A very good read here.  thanks to all
825169,limeyangler,2013-12-19 01:57:00,5204,cool post Wayne……very cool.
824698,irishfield,2013-12-17 00:40:00,26272,"Shots from today...I don't usually go North and over the trees... but.. 380 foot take off in 18"" of snow!Man it looks cold out there.....and the wind chill having to get out and pull the airplane around with the windmill turning didn't help!Snake Island frozen in..Sound almost frozen out to the Giants Tomb.Penetang Harbour iced in.Ever see water boil when it's -18!Nottawasaga Bay freezing in... only the 4th time I've seen this since getting my licence in 1989!Maybe someone should have told them multi million dollar solar farms are useless in Canada!Glousteur Pool (or how ever you spell it) and Six Mile frozen in.Rarely see it frozen in front of the Delewana.. or the channel , let alone in December!"
824701,Old Man,2013-12-17 00:45:00,822,Great shots.   Thanks for sharing.
824705,livinisfishin,2013-12-17 00:49:00,661,Gotta admit the solar farm looks cool snow covered and from above!
824707,irishfield,2013-12-17 00:51:00,26272,That's right behind your place Jason.
824709,Terry,2013-12-17 00:51:00,14456,cool  wonder who goes out with the broom and clears off all the panels
824710,irishfield,2013-12-17 00:52:00,26272,Someone that's a day late Terry... one sunny day in the last 2 weeks and the week to come and they sure weren't making power today!  .. I have to say I found a way to use  tags here.. as I had no other way of entering anything.. locked out on Windows 7 pro
824711,Entropy,2013-12-17 00:53:00,747,Those solar farms are a waste of good land.
824712,livinisfishin,2013-12-17 00:53:00,661,Really?! Never would have guessed it. Can you see that with google earth?
824713,livinisfishin,2013-12-17 00:57:00,661,I agree with you but on the other side of the coin i have a couple of friends that have  been employed building those things. May not be the best things for everyone but they must help someone at some point in time.
824714,Entropy,2013-12-17 01:00:00,747,"I agree with you but on the other side of the coin i have a couple of friends that have been employed building those things. May not be the best things for everyone but they must help someone at some point in time.  Ya, same here.  Falther-inlaw is making real good coin putting these together, working some place near London,  His house is off grid too,  so he really is laughing to the bank."
824716,Terry,2013-12-17 01:05:00,14456," Ya, same here.  Falther-inlaw is making real good coin putting these together, working some place near London,  His house is off grid too,  so he really is laughing to the bank. they pay more then real value and then we make up the difference on our power bills"
824718,Steve,2013-12-17 01:08:00,2075,"just a quick set of numbers, for the business folk on this board.  10MW solar farm cost: $35m Annual revenue generated: $7m (this is not some random number. We have insured these for almost five years. This is the average return, annually, on a 10MW solar farm). I actually insure that specific farm.  Therefore, five years you break even (give or take a year or two depending on financing terms). Your contract with the government is 20 years.  I'm sure it won't take a genius to see the $$business$$ sense behind operating a 10mw solar farm."
824720,BillM,2013-12-17 01:09:00,17367,Great shot Wayne!  Hoping to make it out for some of those Gbay walleyes when the ice is good
824729,irishfield,2013-12-17 01:23:00,26272,Sure beats cutting the hay that they were Steve... but maybe they should have put shakers on the panels. If you're gonna build such a farm right in the lake squall sector... you'd think you'd take into consideration snowfall vs sunny days.  105 million return.. all on the back of hydro one users... No wonder my hydro bills is triple it was in '03. Yah.. I'm just jealous that I don't have a three phase grid going past the gate post!
824731,Steve,2013-12-17 01:28:00,2075,"i won't argue that point bud.  i'm paying like the rest of ya.  i'm not even the broker, so I'm not making any commission on this stuff...I just provide the insurance.  Any questions, just ask.  There was a point about about a waste of land. My personal experience is many, if not most, of these farms are being installed on land that otherwise isn't the most ""farm-able"". (not all, but most)."
824737,irishfield,2013-12-17 01:43:00,26272,"Here's a video to go with the pictures. Unedited.. shows what's involved in a flight in the snow to some extent. Also shows why we get hammered here in the yard with snow, as the highest point of land on the ""coast"" of Georgian Bay and only 3500 feet from same!"
824739,nancur373,2013-12-17 01:45:00,1211,"just a quick set of numbers, for the business folk on this board.  10MW solar farm cost: $35m Annual revenue generated: $7m (this is not some random number.

I'm sure it won't take a genius to see the $$business$$ sense behind operating a 10mw solar farm. Just curious. If the government changes hands, will the contract still be guaranteed? Also I hear the government pays the 'farmer' more for the hydro produced than is collected from the end user. Is this correct?"
824741,Terry,2013-12-17 01:52:00,14456,cool
824748,grizzlybri,2013-12-17 01:59:00,565,great pictures
824749,Steve,2013-12-17 02:02:00,2075,"Yes, they are guaranteed rate contracts, guaranteed for 20 years, regardless of the government in control.  Yes, on the second question as well. If there wasn't an incentive, and the power was purchased at the price collected by the end user, it wouldn't be prudent for ""the farmer"" to put panels on their land/roof/etc.  There have been revisions to the power purchase agreements, originally written prior to ""FIT (feed into tariff)"" program under a contract called ""RESOP"". Since the original power purchase agreement (PPA) offers, the government has consistently been decreasing the price paid per kw. This is proper and accepted by the investor, as the cost of the equipment (panels, inverters, etc) have decreased year by year (due to increased demand and local production).  PPA's entered into today pay the highest from energy generated from panels on a rooftop (incentive to those who don't have ""tons"" of land to use for panels). The next highest is ""small scale - microFIT"" ground mount panels. You see these often on farmers fields with a ""tilting"" mechanism so that the panels follow the sun (those are called trackers). Finally, the lowest amount (but still very healthy amount) is paid to ""large scale"" ground mount farms, usually producing power between 1mw to 10mw - and upwards of 100mw (all per farm)."
824750,Joey,2013-12-17 02:02:00,9122,Very cool Wayne!
824765,hockeyplayerz_14,2013-12-17 03:00:00,160,holy irishfield! thats one of the best reports yet!
824766,irishfield,2013-12-17 03:02:00,26272,Now don't get ahead of yourself fishman.... be a good report if I could land on it and FISH !!
824772,Whopper,2013-12-17 03:16:00,2174,Awesome pictures and video Wayne. Quite the spread you have and the video almost satisfied my need for flight in small craft.  Thanks for sharing!
824773,irishfield,2013-12-17 03:28:00,26272,Well Phil.. while you can land on a Condo... it's damn hard taking off again !
