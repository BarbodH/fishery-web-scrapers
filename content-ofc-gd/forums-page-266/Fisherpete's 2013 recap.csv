824518,spincast,2013-12-16 10:28:00,3279,"some enviable fish as always Pete, congrats. The salmon thing can be quite addictive, and I suspect your quest for the 50 inch Muskie will soon share time with the quest for a Tyee. Look forward to your 2014 posts."

Congrats to you and your bro on a very productive year.  Great review.  I have an identical setup with the Xpedtion ... the rigs and kicker are in the same location ... but there is one major difference.  You must have fish magnets on that thing.  Where did you guys install them, and how many magnets and what brand and you need to also reveal the tesla measure... I'm on to your secrets you know.  Spring time ... how about we get down to the water and chase some around"
