I had that happen to me yesterday, tried to start it and the starter either didn't engage properly or it was stuck, chewed all the teeth off the starter wheel, I took it off and went to the local supply place and picked up a new sprocket, took me about 20min to change. I greased the drive and put it back on, works perfect."
824400,Big Cliff,2013-12-15 17:07:00,6899,"Could just be that the bendix is stuck and it isn't throwing it out to the flywheel. There should be a plastic cover over it, remove the cover and try to move the bendix out to the flywheel (you'll have to turn it by hand DO NOT TRY TO DO THIS WITH THE MACHINE RUNNING OR WHILE TRYING TO START IT). While you are at it, check the teeth on the bendix If they are chewed up then you need a new bendix. Check that and let me know."
824401,livinisfishin,2013-12-15 17:08:00,661,Thanks Matt..thats sounds pretty probable. Ill take it off and look.
824402,4x4bassin,2013-12-15 17:08:00,1025,Starter is pooched ! Try lightly hitting the side of the starter with a small hammer (not too hard) This has worked for me before . The gear that shoots out and engages with the flywheel is probably stuck and hitting the side of the starter can loosen it up . Or take apart and give the gear a little shot of WD to loosen it up !

They are desigined to be run with them dry or you could put a bit of graphite on it but it's better dry. Before you ruin another bendix, remove it and get rid of the grease."

824406,livinisfishin,2013-12-15 17:16:00,661,I will check back in latee with my findings. Have to go get a christmas tree before I can dig into it.. Thanks for all of the suggestions so far!

Sorry, grease was the wrong word, thanks for the correction! I actually just finger rubbed some 5 w 30 on it. The guys at the shop recommended that."

The guys at the shop recommended that. 5W-30 isn't too bad. I do prefer a bit of graphite if I use anything but you should be ok with the 5W-30. Anything that gets stickey when it is really cold will just make it harder for the bendix to throw out and return and since most snow blowers sit in the cold until needed..... I often see blowers come in that someone has serviced themselves and they have greased the gears and slider under the blower then they can't shift it when it gets cold LOL."

Went  out and did it again and the cord comes off LOL. They will see me at 7 am tomorrow. I'm taking the carb to get checked too, it's about time bad luck I bet, had it running the first week in Nov. as usual and all was well,"
