824694,kickingfrog,2013-12-17 00:28:00,8333,"Minus 23 at 8:30 this morning and it only got up to minus 13 this afternoon. Lots of localized clouds over the open main lake. Hope the warm temps and rain forecast for later this week don't come around, although no matter the weather I won't be going out until after Christmas"

824787,Ron,2013-12-17 06:38:00,1683,"I actually welcome the warm snaps in between making ice. It's a good thing. Melts down what snow is on the surface and flattens out the sharp edges!  It takes a lot more than a couple days  of warm weather to loose what ice we get. Afterall, how many days of minus temps have we had to get what we have so far?  Cheers, Ron..."
