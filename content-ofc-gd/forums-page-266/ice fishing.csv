824280,hotsky,2013-12-14 21:24:00,400,Im in Hamilton and it's been below 0 for a while now... Everything has to be iced over by now. Any reports on the ice conditions of the lakes near by?
824284,pics,2013-12-14 21:44:00,1268,"Still too soon but if you have a float suit and a buddy with rope and his own suit...have at er... it could be 4 inches in one spot, 2 in another.. BUT, there was a report of safe ice in fishmasters marina"
824287,davey buoy,2013-12-14 21:55:00,5505,"The high winds over the last couple days,played havic with the waters freezing.Some small lakes that were iced over might of survived the winds."
824289,Cosmos,2013-12-14 22:04:00,588,"Came from Couch. Pretty far from Hamilton, but if you want to fish it is an option. Ice is 4-5 inches at all spots I fished. Fishing was slow, but managed to get enough for supper."
824364,Richie Razor,2013-12-15 04:14:00,536,How were the perch fillets? We're they grub infested?
824367,Old Ironmaker,2013-12-15 04:57:00,8243,"Some thin ice at Long Point Bay. I wouldn't go out until the commercial guys put out their huts here.  Perch is $8.00 a pound in Dover, still fresh for now. If you need a meal, ice fishing in southern On. Isn't the wat to get it yet, here anyway. Soon we hope. It's the earliest winter in years, it's a few days away, it's still fall, patience. Some ski resorts on the southern tier in NY have not had this much snow this early since the 70's I have heard."
824374,Rich,2013-12-15 10:03:00,3927,"I'm just packing my stuff up and headed ice fishing.  Bring a spud, and look for smaller waterbodies that are out of the wind. Or just wait til you see people out on the hammer. Lol"
824419,Cosmos,2013-12-15 18:34:00,588,"Kept 4 fish for supper, 2 were grubs free."
824423,captpierre,2013-12-15 21:20:00,2521,Commercial guys ice fishing?  Didn't know that.  How exactly do they do that?
824430,Christopheraaron,2013-12-15 22:09:00,3525,Commercial guys ice fishing?  Didn't know that.  How exactly do they do that? I'm guessing he's talking about guys that rent out huts.
824435,irishfield,2013-12-15 22:20:00,26272,I'm guessing he's just talking about fish prices from commercial trollers... but that's just me.

824442,irishfield,2013-12-15 22:54:00,26272,"Yep.. ""commercial guys put their huts out""... Rentals. Price of fish.. trolling fleet."
824443,Terry,2013-12-15 22:57:00,14456,"Yep.. ""commercial guys put their huts out""... Rentals. Price of fish.. trolling fleet. that's how I read it"
824444,Christopheraaron,2013-12-15 23:00:00,3525,same here.
824539,pics,2013-12-16 13:54:00,1268,Valens and Binbrook won't be open until they have good enough ice due to insurance issues. There's Martindale pond and the boat launch at pier 4 that should be thick enough soon. If you like to fish early or late in the season then ask Santa for a float suit... or try to find a used one for sale.... take no chances
