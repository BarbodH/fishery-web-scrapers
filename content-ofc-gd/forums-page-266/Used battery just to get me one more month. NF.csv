Thanks guys for any ideas.  Dave."
824616,irishfield,2013-12-16 20:59:00,26272,Make sure you but a booster pack on it.. before pulling the terminals so it doesn't have to relearn idle settings and more..

824618,irishfield,2013-12-16 21:05:00,26272,Yah.. it'll pick itself up. Just easier when you keep some power on it during the swap. I learned that way back in '90 when I killed my SC's battery.

That's another thing,picked up one of those battery packs from Princess auto 2 years ago.Periodically charged it every three mths,went to use it twice in that first year.Never worked once and it was a 300amp model.Since learned to never buy anything electrically related from that store."

824635,davey buoy,2013-12-16 22:14:00,5505,"auto wreckers. i bought one recently for 35 bucks Really,did they give you credit for the old one,or was that asking to much?."
824636,nancur373,2013-12-16 22:19:00,1211,they would have given 7 bucks credit but i didn't have the old one with me there. Took it to a scrap dealer later and got 10 bucks

824666,nancur373,2013-12-16 23:32:00,1211,not sure. i went to one in mississauga
824673,Canuck2fan,2013-12-16 23:43:00,1444,"Auto wrecker is the way to go. I got one 6 months ago there for 35.00, because when the right deal comes along I am scrapping this car...  My boss laughed at me at the time saying I was cheap. I have since boosted his piece of crap 2009 Honda van and his wife's car, both of who's batteries crapped out within in 4 days of one another. Instead of listening to me and getting one for her 2000 Mazda they got it at the dealer 185.00 including installation. When I said they got robbed he wouldn't tell me what the Honda stealership charged him for his LOL."

Good to know.If I was buying out the car I wouldn't of asked the question.Under these circumstances I think this is the way I'll go.Thanks as well."
