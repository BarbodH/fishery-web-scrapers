824791,fishindevil,2013-12-17 08:05:00,6254,"Thanks for sharing I watch the site everyday and it's amazing about the progession of the ice and snow and same for spring when it starts going out !!!!! Lots of the smaller lakes are very safe now guys are fishing all of the Kawartha lakes and have been for 2 weeks lots of sleds out as well !!!  Just be careful and use common sense !!!!! Like the old saying goes ""if you don't know,don't go"" that simple !!!!!! Tight-lines"

824824,lovetofish,2013-12-17 16:58:00,500,"I saw a report on another board and the guy drilled a hole and there was 4"" of ice at the end of Gilford road. Anyone know how the ice is at Virginia Beach?"
824844,Freshtrax,2013-12-17 19:38:00,2215,"I'm looking out the end of bbp and its ice as far as the eye can see.  Not much snow , let's hope it makes it through the warm spell and continues to thicken till jan 1"
