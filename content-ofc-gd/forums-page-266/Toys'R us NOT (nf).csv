You poured goop into a metal mold and put it on a hotplate as you leaned over it so you could smell when it was done. You then used a cheesy clip to lift it out and dunk it in to a bowl of water.

Probably wouldn't go over big these days."

824246,Dave Bailey,2013-12-14 17:00:00,1641,"Lol Chad, I would have done but ended up at the new Cabela's in Winnipeg by myself, Jack was napping back at the hotel after some pretty yucky dental work.  Next time you head there take him to a hobby shop and let him pick out a model aircraft kit. Teaches him to read instructions, follow directions, and how to turn a few odd shaped lumps of plastic into something way cool! Revell has a series of kits that are snap-together, no glue required, or if you feel confident enough with him working with glue you just get something simple with a small number of parts. You might want to pick up a few, that way if he gets hooked you don't need to go all the way back to Winterpeg! Here's a Yellow Pages list of hobby shops there: http://www.yellowpages.ca/search/si/1/Model+Construction+%26+Hobby+Shops/Winnipeg+MB"

824356,Bernie,2013-12-15 03:41:00,3190,"Thinking back on all the cool toys I had as a kid (I was spoiled). Too many to remember.Meccano got a good workout.Slot cars, model cars, got into building balsa wood planes with .049 engines you flew on a string.A buddy and I also built a motorized go-kart from scrap materials.One special one that comes to mind was called a Vaccuform. It had sheets of plastic that went on the top that were heated by the machine. Under the plastic you could put different forms that the plastic would form over when the vacuum was applied."
824373,fishindevil,2013-12-15 09:38:00,6254,Like terry said I got BB guns slingshots and even a bow & arrow set !!!!! It was awesome oh ya and I can't forget the lawn darts !!!!! We played cowboys & Indians with real BB guns !!!! Haha and no none of us shot our eye out !!! But man we had cool stuff for sure and yes every bit had a jackknife I got one from my uncle when I was about 11 and it had my name on it and it was a Swiss Army knife !!!! I took that everywhere we were allowed too !!!! There was never any worry about stabbing people or anything things were not like that back then as most boys had one !!!!! And by 13 some of us even got our grandpas .22 rifles !!!! Ahhhh the memories .....

Mom wasn't impressed!  I have to chime in.  You just reminded me of something I havn't thought of in almost 30 years. Grade 9 science class I made a working model of a volcano using paper mache some paint and a similar concoction of chemicals. It was supposed to just smoke a little bit, but, ""more is always better"" has always been my mantra and I stuffed that volcano full. When I lit the thing it literally did erupt. Someone sounded the fire alarm and the entire school was evacuated LOL!  Good times, good times."

If you are looking for non role type/ non stereotype toys you are going to have to look at some of the more independent toy shops. They are out there, and yes, more expensive. Mastermind and Teachers Choice come to mind, but even they get caught up in some story specific toys like ""Thomas"". Yes I remember Lincoln Logs and Tinkertoys. I got those under the tree alongside green ( Brit and yank) and grey (German) army men.  We actually have a good independent toy store in town which has good customer service but limited choice that we use frequently, however we went into that toys are whatever shop for some lego as we were in town. Lego is awesome! And Jack loves it! Its just disappointing to see such an awesome product that i grew up with hijacked to the point of disgusting by Disney Pixar! Problem is we watch a lot of Disney Pixar movies which Jack also loves(i love a couple of them too) It just feels so cynical to see companies sell their soul soooo completely to maximize PROFIT. But like others have said….they sell what people buy…..so what is the answer????  BALANCE. Thats part the reason we moved away from the city to live here. Yeah i have as many gadgets as the next person, but we don't have cell phones….no need to constantly tell everyone you are on the bus, in the shop, etc…etc….thats what Facebook is for…..lol.

Glad I don't have to go through that crap anymore !!!!!! And you guys have just begun it ..... I feel sorry for you  Am not too worried about it, as parents we are in control of what Jack has access to. Two of his favourite possessions are a pink pony doll he found washed up on shore and a musical jewellery box….he is a child and loves these things……watching a child love something is awesome….what kind of parent would I be if i turned around and confiscated those things because of some warped, homophobic idiotic notion of gender roles? Well i'd be a warped, homophobic idiotic parent…lol…….NO THANKS!  I hated my parents for not letting me have the latest 'Hot Wheels'/Evil Knievel/Atari….but love them for it now as it made you use your imagination and decide for yourself what the world was like…rather than be told by Disney or Mattel!  Hahahha, that's like Marks Workwear, should be Victoria's Secret, more tutu's and pink pyjamas that WORK WEAR.  Pink tool sets for gawd's sake!  My favorite toy when I was a kid, was a Chemistry set. I set up a Lab under the stairs, and almost burned the house down with the alcohol burner that came with it............Sigh......made my first gun powder with that set. Good times.

Unless you've been living in a cave, everything for the past 25 years has been branded by Lego, Disney, Marvel, DC, TV Shows, etc.  Toy manufacturers are not stupid at all, they know putting an advertisement of Power Rangers action figures on YTV is going to net them huge profits come Christmas time when Tommy wants the Blue Ranger set he saw.
