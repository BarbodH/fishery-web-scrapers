Last night we were just sitting here about 7:00 doing nothing and there's a knock at the door, so Diane answers it and there's a couple from down the road standing there dressed to the nines.  Diane says, ""oh, you guys are early"" and he says ""why, weren't we sposed to be here for 7:00 o'clock ??""  Diane says, yeah, 7:00 TOMORROW NIGHT  He says ""well that explains why there aren't any cars in your driveway""  We all had a good laugh and they came in for a couple drinks anyways.  Always good when we can laugh at ourselves  "
