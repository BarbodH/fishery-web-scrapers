824229,woodenboater,2013-12-14 15:21:00,2277,no idea if this website is legit or not as I'm not into musky (yet ha ha). anyone else heard about this ?  http://muskokaoutdoors.ca/home/hunting-fishing-news/item/121-2-potential-igfa-musky-world-records-caught?utm_medium=twitter&utm_source=twitterfeed#.Uqx2TaU8MjI
824238,Joey,2013-12-14 16:16:00,9122,Two solid fish that 's for sure!
824242,Terry,2013-12-14 16:43:00,14456,the first one seems way bigger then the second one
824244,solopaddler,2013-12-14 16:57:00,8605,100% legit. The press release was forwarded to me two days ago.  Two very impressive fish for sure.
824274,woodenboater,2013-12-14 20:32:00,2277,the top musky looks like a freak of nature compared to the second one. both of which would probably send me into a fishing coma if I were able to boat those two beasts lol

824291,muskymatt,2013-12-14 22:09:00,2608,"Neither fish are in the weight and length class of some of the giants caught in the last couple years, if its under 57-58"" and under 28"" girth, it simply doesn't measure up.  That said, it doesn't mean its not an awesome fish and a fish of a lifetime, something to be proud of."
824293,solopaddler,2013-12-14 22:28:00,8605,There's other criteria for records besides just weight.
824295,muskymatt,2013-12-14 22:34:00,2608,"There's other criteria for records besides just weight.  Yes I realize that.  Personally, I think it should be a formula based on length and girth. Not sure how that would be done, but say a 62 x 28 and a 59 x 34 would both be eligible for world record status. One with incredible length, the other with incredible girth."
824304,captpierre,2013-12-14 22:50:00,2521,"So when they measure officially, do the pinch the tail or measure with the tail wide open?  Can add 2 inches, I bet, in a big fish  peter"

Can add 2 inches, I bet, in a big fish  peter  I think the IGFA guidelines might ask for both of those measurements, fork length and total length, mouth must be closed"

These are line class records, ie. 60 lb. braid or 60 lb. mono or whatever. 132 cm is about 52 inches. These line class records that look pretty big. Still waiting for the picture of recent 59 by 34 inch St. Lawrence musky. It would dwarf these fish. lol"
