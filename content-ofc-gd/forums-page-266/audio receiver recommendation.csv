824940,moemoe,2013-12-18 02:33:00,352,"Hey guys, in the market for a new receiver for my home theatre system, bought new jones pioneer speakers, looking for a midlevel amp,any recommendations? I dont need a 7.2 system.....thinking a denon avr 300 or x1000, or pioneer vsx 823 or sony 840, checked out some av forums but no consensus...figured I would asked the fishing specialists!"
824946,vance,2013-12-18 02:51:00,719,"I have  Yamaha rx-v663 it is a few years old and I love it,it is 9 channel but the sound is awesome and it handles any inputs that you have with one wire output and it will adapt to seating and room configuration.  vance"
824953,irishfield,2013-12-18 03:03:00,26272,fisherpete had a nice system for sale.. check the classifieds..
824957,Dan668,2013-12-18 03:16:00,1120,See if you can find a denon 1713. Better than the 300/1000. I picked up one on clear out for 200$. Prob hard to find now though.

824997,scugpg,2013-12-18 11:16:00,1373,check out the marantz 1403 at future shop when on sale. good reviews its a 5.1 receiver and a small profile. also has 3yr warranty. the sony 840 also has good reviews online.
825000,BassMan11,2013-12-18 12:16:00,583,The Denon is nice.... I bought a 1613 a year ago and am really happy with it. The 1713 has the airplay feature which is pretty slick
825008,Raf,2013-12-18 13:29:00,3495,"I have the Denon 1713, great unit.  If you can't find it, check what the replacement model is.  They renumbered their lines for this year."
825009,blarg,2013-12-18 13:43:00,289,"Denon is a good choice, but just about any brand would do depending upon how fussy you are, you really don't need huge watts especially from a better brand like denon or Yamaha, assuming your speakers aren't hard to drive.  I have the denon avr 991, it's a couple years old and I've been very happy with it, it drives my energy RC-70's to louder than should be legal volumes while being very clear.  I think it's rated at 135w/channel in stereo, but those numbers aren't always comparable to other brands as there is not set standard for measurement.  Anyway, a good brand with the connectivity and features you want, like say room correction, is more important than squeezing out 10 more watts for 200 bucks, most of the time at normal listening you're using literally less than a single watt."
825011,bigbuck,2013-12-18 13:57:00,2449,"You guys are going to think I am crazy but buy the heaviest unit in your price range regardless of output. The heavier units have better quality components in them and put out better quality sound. With the drive these days to cut costs, receivers do not weigh much at all. Most do not even have very good heat management in the form of heavy duty heat sinks. You cannot go wrong with Denon, Harman Kardon, Yamaha, Onkyo and the like."
825013,BillM,2013-12-18 14:16:00,17367,"Yamaha or Denon..   I liked Onkyo when they were made in Japan, since they've gone chinese, not so much.   Can't go wrong with a Marantz either.  Pioneer is another brand you should seriously consider as well."
825061,lookinforwalleye,2013-12-18 18:09:00,4399,"Don`t know how much coin you want to spend but the Pioneer Elite series is great as is the Yamaha RX series I have had both and either will not disappoint.  The equipment you mentioned are entry level type stuff nothing wrong with that just depends on what your listening habits are, the last system I had was Yamaha with paridigm and cerwin vega would literally shake stuff off the walls and furniture...probably why I am dealing with Tinnitus these days!!!"
825090,moemoe,2013-12-18 20:09:00,352,"i have a entry level yamaha 6150 that the 2 front channels gave out on, the denon 1713 has some pretty good reviews, danbob, where did you get that for 200$?"
825091,Raf,2013-12-18 20:10:00,3495,you may find it at futureshop they were moving them out earlier this year.. stock will vary from location to location
825092,Dan668,2013-12-18 20:19:00,1120,Futureshop when they were clearing them out. Not sure whether stores still have stock. If not wait for boxing day or price match the 300/1000 with Gibbys Electronics in St Kitts. They have them both on sale.
