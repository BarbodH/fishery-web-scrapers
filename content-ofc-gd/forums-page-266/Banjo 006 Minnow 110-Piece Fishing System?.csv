824192,canon,2013-12-14 06:03:00,36,"Anyone tried ""Banjo 006 Minnow 110-Piece Fishing System""? looks attractive, but see many reviewers said its not working, but also some reviewers said those who blamed this lure caught zero fish was amateur and they just dont know how to use it. I know guys here are many pros, so your experiences if you ever used this lure definitely help me to make decision go or no go. Thanks."
824194,Ben_Daniels,2013-12-14 06:23:00,435,"I bought some about 10 years ago, they caught some fish but personally like a zoom super fluke better. I see its going for $5 on eBay... Worth a try for that price. http://m.ebay.com/itm/310819878278"
824196,manitoubass2,2013-12-14 07:28:00,11391,"Its called a ""banjo"" ironically because they are playing you like a fiddle"
824197,Freshtrax,2013-12-14 07:28:00,2215,I bought them at wallmart...ended up jigging up lakers with the white ones...
824199,Big Cliff,2013-12-14 10:08:00,6899,"When they first came out I and nearly all my fishing buddies bought them, they look great but apart from that I don't think any of us ever did catch too many fish on them. Mind you, we aren't pros."
824203,corvette1,2013-12-14 11:29:00,1765,cought my 16lb walleye and 14 others the same day at quinte they work
824207,Garnet,2013-12-14 12:44:00,2056,I won a walleye tournament on Rice with the perch color. It was a 60 and under so likely 100 boats.
824208,John Bacon,2013-12-14 13:19:00,3277,They will catch fish.  But they are no miracle lure; they are not going to catch any more fish than a typical soft bait.  If you can get it for a decent price then it will be worth it.
824213,aplumma,2013-12-14 13:36:00,6896,they fish well with a look that is similar to a senco in movement. It lacks the flavor and consistence that makes sencos such an awesome lure. They also have poor hookup because of the way they are attached hook in front of the lure and if you get a hook up they can be easily thrown. Get a few packs of sencos on an unweighted hook and you will be miles ahead.  Art
824217,Garnet,2013-12-14 13:53:00,2056,The real problem for me was you couldn't go buy 5 packs of white. You had to buy a stinking kit.
824221,Gallie,2013-12-14 14:22:00,1215,Agreed i like using the big white one for picky pike in shallow water in spring time. Its not my go to lure but it has its uses
824225,solopaddler,2013-12-14 14:54:00,8605,Just for fun I had a quick look and you can buy any color you want individually at the Banjo Minnow store. You don't need to buy a kit.
824232,Richie Razor,2013-12-14 16:02:00,536,I just checked the quantity of the white color and they're sold out. Funny how that happens
824257,Garnet,2013-12-14 18:32:00,2056,It's about 20 years to late for my interest. And I never seen them in any store I've been in.  Likely the first swimbait I use their is just so many better ones now a days.
824272,msp,2013-12-14 20:24:00,1336,I remember this episode from years ago. If you can find the whole episode watch it.   I have never tried the Banjo Minnow
824366,canon,2013-12-15 04:50:00,36,"Thanks everyone, really appreciate. So, I am not gonna buy it on the regular price $20, unless I can find $10 pakcage somewhere then worth to have a try."
