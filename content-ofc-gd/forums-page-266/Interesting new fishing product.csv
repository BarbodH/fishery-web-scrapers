824846,muddler,2013-12-17 19:53:00,623,At first glance it appears to be a real good idea. The only problem that I can see is that someone like me who changes baits a lot would end up with a box full of baits that would really stink. What are the long term effects on the  environment and on the bait itself? Does it dry up and then become water activated later on?  Right now I just squirt some scent on. If I don't get a strike after half an hour I change lures and squirt again. It doesn't appear to affect my extensive collection of baits as most of the scent washes of in less than 30 minutes.  Just my opinion.  muddler

824891,captpierre,2013-12-17 23:48:00,2521,I'd try it. Hard to determine if works. Would have to fish with a buddy all day. Use same lure and technique. One with and the other without.  If they did this study and could document it....be a home run.
