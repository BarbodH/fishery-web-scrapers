On the other hand, my best friend just bought a brand new F-150 with projector headlights and gets beamed by 1 of 10 cars passing by because they blind everybody. As long as the headlights are positioned properly i dont see what hatred you have against them.  If you want to run HID's, you should be doing it with projectors that were designed for it.    They should be pulling guys like you over and giving you a nice hefty fine.   Nothing worse then driving down the road and having some guy in the other lane blind you with his $70 Ebay specials.  As for your buddy with the F150, he can easily adjust those lights, you on the other hand can't because you've got all kinds of light hitting the bottom of the reflector and lighting up heavens."

I drive country roads and do so at the speed limit or the usual over the limit, but I’m certain I’m over driving my lights. I’d love to see the deer and pot holes coming before I hit them.   If I understand your post correctly, this is only an issue in low light while it's raining and maybe some light fog or some steam coming off the road? Most people solve the problem you're having by driving according to the conditions and going slower than the speed limit to compensate for decreased visibility. I've drove an identical car as yours for a week and it's lights were fine on dark rainy nights when driving at appropriate speeds for the amount of rain coming down.  My pickup has bright head and fog lights and I still slow down in rainy and low light conditions...   The next time you find yourself over driving your lights, try slowing down 10-20 km/h. It'll work better than any light and it's cheaper too"

The OP is describing the term in his initial post to a ""T"". Here is a better description than mine:  I listened as a State Policeman described an accident.  The driver was traveling way too fast one night and missed a curve, that is, literally didn’t see the curve, and drove straight through it.  I asked, “What do you mean he missed the curve?  Do you mean he didn’t turn his wheels enough to make the curve?”  “No,” the officer said.  “He literally missed the curve.  He was speeding so fast that he didn’t see the curve.  It was night and his headlights didn’t light up the curve soon enough for him to react and turn his wheels.  He outran his headlights.”"

If it is, the pitting diffuses the light all over the place but the road. There are many kinds of polishing kits on the market. Takes time to do them right, the cheap polish kits don't last, they simply temporarily fill in the pits.  Like fisherman said, there are brighter bulbs, but they tend to burn out quickly. I'd suggest some additional lighting be added. Here again, don't cheap out or you are wasting your time and money. Get some lights that are not flood but a beam that will shine forward.
