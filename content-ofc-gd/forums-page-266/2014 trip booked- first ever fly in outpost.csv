I had an offer to go to a lodge in Iglooglik, Nunuvit, and to stay for free for a week and go fishing and do some photography (they regularly charge $250 per person per night, food and lodging).  I thought what an opportunity of a lifetime, until I checked out the cost to fly there  Two return tickets is almost $8,000 with taxes."
