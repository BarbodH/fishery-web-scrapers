I see Fishmasters posting some nice catches and I will probably give it a try sometime during this week (hopefully tomorrow  ). I don't drive so I'm wondering if anyone knows of any good hut rentals or local spots that are SAFE close to the grand, on the grand, or near Hamilton ?  I'm only in Hamilton for this week, after this week ill be fishing up at lake Simcoe for them JUMBO perch. Hopefully I can make the best of my time off as I will be right back into school mode and no fishing for another 3 months  .    Thanks  Johnnyboy "

824657,johnnybo1,2013-12-16 23:08:00,42,"hi Irishfield,  Oh man Georgian bay is a true fishing paradise one of my favorite places to fish, Spring for pike, summer for LM and SM bass and fall for musky (even though I've yet to catch one ) Sadly its way to far for me to go right now. Cant wait to finish school and get my car and boat combo  ,  thanks for the reply  Johnnyboy"
