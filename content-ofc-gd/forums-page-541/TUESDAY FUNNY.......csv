Her 9-year old son comes home unexpectedly, sees them, and hides in the bedroom closet. Then the woman's husband also comes home. She puts her lover in the closet, not realizing that the little boy is in there already.  The little boy says, 'Dark in here.' The man says, 'Yes, it is.'  Boy - 'I have a Rapala.'  Man - 'That's nice.'  Boy - 'Want to buy it?'  Man - 'No, thanks.'  Boy - 'My dad's outside.'  Man - 'OK, how much?'  Boy - '$250'  A few weeks later, it happens again that the boy and the lover, are in the closet together..  Boy - 'Dark in here.'  Man - 'Yes, it is.'  Boy - 'I have Berkley Lightnin' Rod. 'The lover, remembering the last time, asks the boy, 'How much?'  Boy - '$750'  Man - 'Sold.'  A few days later, the boys father says to the boy, 'Grab your Lightnin' Rod and Rapala , let's go to the river and have some father & son  fishin' time. The boy says, 'I can't, I sold my Rapala and Lightnin' Rod dad.'  The father says, 'What?! How much did you sell them for?'  Boy - '$1,000.'  The father says, 'That's terrible to overcharge your friends like that. That is far more than those two things cost. I'm going to take you to church and make you  confess.'  They go to the church, and the father makes the little boy sit in the confession booth and he closes the door.  The boy says, 'Dark in here.' * * * * * * The priest says, * * * *  'Don't start that crap with me again. You're in my closet now.'     Randy "
