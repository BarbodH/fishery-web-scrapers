Give Kevin and Leslie a call to see what may be available.  Great times, great friends, and some good fishing thrown in."

My buddy has been going camping in the fall for many years in the Hartley Bay area.  He always has a good time and manages to catch some nice fish.  My next trip to the French River will be to the French River Lodge.  My buddy canoes by it all the time when he camps out there and we've been talking about staying at this lodge for a while now - so hopefully it will happen this year.  French River PP is a truly beautiful place for it's location."
