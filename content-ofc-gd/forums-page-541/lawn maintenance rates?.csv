581598,irishfield,2011-05-11 01:24:00,26272,Here all week thru Saturday... not sure what Thursday vistors/times look like yet for us to skip out.
581609,ketchenany,2011-05-11 01:46:00,3229," Anyone need any typography/proofreading services, I come cheap at $55 per hour! my lawn needs help!"
581616,GBW,2011-05-11 01:49:00,8460,"Let ""us"" know when you can.  Maybe the other guy can get the bill too..."
581410,GBW,2011-05-10 16:21:00,8460,Does anyone here pay to get your yard work done?  A guy across the st. from me lives in the USA and has a home here for the summer.  In the winter I took care of the snow removel for him (at a fee).  Now he's asking me for a rate to cut the grass and do the edging for the whole season.  The lot's 40' x 110' and I would say the home is around 2500 SQ feet.  Thoughts on what I should charge?  I sure hope he's not asking me to weed it cause it's bad...
581416,fishermccann,2011-05-10 16:47:00,655,"In-laws pay 200 a month and it gets cut as often as needed, which is sometimes once a week and sometimes twice if is growing like crazy. Yes from a prof. compay in the GTA and not some neighbors kid. ( that would be better but there is none around). Thier lot is 50 by 220."
581421,Fish4Eyes,2011-05-10 16:53:00,1022,Sounds like it would be a half hour work once a week. Assuming its just cutting and edging I say 20$ a week is fair.
581431,BITEME,2011-05-10 17:43:00,1968,depends do you really want to do it is it cut into your time ......anyway i would say 200.00 a month at your descretion for cutting and you will do the whole shot
581437,Harrison,2011-05-10 17:58:00,2202,"A lot like that is $40 bucks a cut, edging and garden weeding included(once a month).  $160 a month.  I am still in the Landscape biz but more silently now.  Let me know if you are looking to sub this out, we have a property maintenance crew."
581438,GBW,2011-05-10 18:00:00,8460,thank you very much!
581442,Pikeslayer,2011-05-10 18:23:00,1443,"Geoff, If you're interested in contracting this out, I could do it for about $780 per cut and you're good for 12% share. Cold hard cash. I also do daycare for $600/hr (per child BTW) and would be willing to kick back maybe 21% to your wife. I don't have any landscaping or daycare experience just yet but I'm thinking I could combine the two and learn 'on the job'. Can the little brats kids drive a lawn tractor?? Let me know, I'm just getting into this kind of stuff and looking for my first gigaroo.  Slayer"
581444,GBW,2011-05-10 18:28:00,8460,I've seen your garden and something tells me you spent some time there recently...
581445,johnnyb,2011-05-10 18:28:00,3413,    Post of the Day...by far!   :rofl2:
581446,bassjnkie,2011-05-10 18:31:00,1101,"In are subdivision, the works go from $280-$320 a month. Includes: turning beds, pruning, fertilizing, trimming, cutting, blowing, bagging and disposal. If your doing all that, $20 a week is nothing, factor in  Gas, time and wear and tear."
581470,Lunker777,2011-05-10 20:35:00,866,"$50 bucks a cut.... bottom line.  Thats roughly $1500 for the season ! Cutting and Trimming...... ""Lawn Maintenance""  I deal with commercial cutters all the time. I have 3 that I look after myself ( Sell them Equipment )  $50 a cut seems to be the norm in my area"
581476,mercman,2011-05-10 20:45:00,7054,"   You my friend, are a very special person."
581479,F7Firecat,2011-05-10 20:58:00,347,man im gonna get in the lawn cutting business.........lots of money there
581489,Handlebarz,2011-05-10 21:11:00,3790,  Well I can tell you that $600/hr is way to cheap just post here and let us know how your making out after 2 hours and again after 8 hours and then at 9 hours when the parents say were running late but will be right there. I would take nothing less then $1200 per booger picker.  Yes I have experience with wife runs a home daycare and I give her all the props in the world anything more I say will incriminate me  And yes I give this post of the month vote also

581552,Billy Bob,2011-05-10 23:45:00,5865,It all depends on how much YOU want to do this job....not very interested...then $50 or more per cutting....need the money....make the price attractive to the customer...
581554,Billy Bob,2011-05-10 23:47:00,5865, I'll tell you what....how hot is the daycare girl...I might need some care from time to time...LOL...
581555,GBW,2011-05-10 23:48:00,8460,True.  So I told him $800 for the season of just cutting.  He's going to call me again tomorrow.  If he want's more then just the cutting my price goes up as I hate cutting the grass but I can use the extra $ for a few new fishing toys (like a much needed new rain suit).
581557,GBW,2011-05-10 23:49:00,8460,It's my wife who run's our home daycare so HOT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  And the answer is NOPE!
581559,Billy Bob,2011-05-10 23:50:00,5865, Damn....AGAIN....  ...LOL
581576,HTHM,2011-05-11 00:53:00,4082,    This thread is useless without pics!
581577,irishfield,2011-05-11 00:54:00,26272,I have some but Geoff would get real mad if I shared them!!
581591,GBW,2011-05-11 01:15:00,8460,"I have been waiting for you to post some comment here...  PS, I would be banned and the 'kids' on the site would be PM'ing me for info if I posted anything good..."
581593,irishfield,2011-05-11 01:18:00,26272,"LOL Geoff.. I gots ta keep me self entertained somehow this week, while sitting in the 11th floor lounge!"
