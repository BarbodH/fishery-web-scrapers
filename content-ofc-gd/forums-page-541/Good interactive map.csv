580591,splashhopper,2011-05-08 02:11:00,2931,excellent
580625,Rod Caster,2011-05-08 05:28:00,5784,  awaiting a PM.
580633,Fishnwire,2011-05-08 11:15:00,983,Amazing.  Thanks a ton for this.  I've seen my lake appear on a non-satellite image based map only a couple of times and seen it named only one other time...this is awesome!
580657,Joeytier,2011-05-08 14:05:00,3990,Used this a few times.  Landed me nothin' but a few nice hikes.
581397,johnnyb,2011-05-10 15:39:00,3413,I can't get this thing to work....clicked on terms of use...accepted...and now I just have a blank screen...ads on the right side...header on the top....no map!
581469,Rod Caster,2011-05-10 20:32:00,5784, Maybe your internet settings need to be adjusted?? Or an old version of IE??
581471,johnnyb,2011-05-10 20:36:00,3413,Probably the settings....pretty sure its IE8...one of these crazy IT guys just upgraded my workstation...so it's all wonky now
581483,Rod Caster,2011-05-10 21:02:00,5784,IT guys are always screwing with us non- IT types. Haha
