581358,GBW,2011-05-10 14:18:00,8460,Well it looks like an OFC'er is getting a new fishing buddy.      Tucker will be going to his new home later this week.  I'm not going to name any names as to who the lucky person is but they can feel free to reply to this.  Please don't let this thread go all to    like the other one did.  I asked for the other one to be locked because of it.

581367,lookinforwalleye,2011-05-10 14:44:00,4399,"Your kidding!!!  That`s ""KEWL""  I guess thats okay he learned how to play in Montreal!"
581369,GBW,2011-05-10 14:46:00,8460,"no joke, he's a hab's fan."
581378,lookinforwalleye,2011-05-10 14:54:00,4399,"Gonna have to do a name change...Lafleur,Lemaire,Gomez!!!"

581382,GBW,2011-05-10 15:07:00,8460,"no, the current owner is a hab's fan.  the new owner, I'm not sure.  Thanks.  I had a feeling all would be well in the end."
581389,redskullz,2011-05-10 15:25:00,55,Great to see the pup get a new home.
581408,umKthxbye,2011-05-10 16:15:00,247,"Jacks aren't for every one. Most people buy them thinking it will be a purse dog like a chiwawa. These dogs need constant attention and exercise. I know my jack bit a dog before only because mine had a hurt paw and didn't want it to be touched. Vice grip is a good term for it since I've had to pry a few rabbits out of his mouth. He is a sweetheart though just don't touch his hurt parts lol. His sister on the other hand is a scaredy cat and a total bugger to him but he can kick her ass no problem, the guy is build like a tank. Glad to see this one got picked up. They are good around kids for the most part, it's mostly the kids fault if they get bit. Jacks love life I'd say more then any dog I've seen or had just gotta drain their energy or else crap happens. Wish I could run a car on Jack energy, would hardly run out of gas"

581458,Rattletrap2,2011-05-10 19:37:00,1652,"Congrats Don! Dogs are such a treasure to have around. I'm glad the little guy has a new owner who hopefully has the patience and determination to give him what he needs.  Good luck with the adjustment period, and keep us posted on the progress he makes in his new home."
