581810,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2011-05-11 20:14:00,0,let me know if you manage to make it to that river i mentioned.  i might head up there in a few days myself.
581819,Rod Caster,2011-05-11 20:51:00,5784, Ends up I hiked myself out on a few other rivers so I didn't make it to the spot you recommended. I caught this one at a very non-descript spot.... suprised me even. I'm back in North Bay now... next time I'm in your area I'll give you a msg.  Air Canada lost my tackle bag... imagine how happy I am now.
581838,cheaptackle,2011-05-11 21:39:00,849,NOT the blue one?  Michael
