581252,Rod Caster,2011-05-10 02:54:00,5784,"Today was a travel day so I had lots of time to pull over and fish MANY creeks and rivers on the Superior north shore. I have some insiders in this area who tell me the bows are starting to run, albeit not fully since it's been cold. The rivers are very fast and quite murky. I spoke to a few guys who were catching a few fish but I got SQUAT.  One hefty sucker was all I managed to drag in. Two days ago I scratched the paint job off my truck and today I scratched the skin off my arms walking through some very dense forest. I was sure I'd have an amazing turnout today.... but my optimism has turned to self deprication. I should have time to fish after work tomorrow... I want nothing more than to post a nice c & r report for all you nice folks.  If you don't hear from me tomorrow night, you can assume my gear is somewhere in lake superior.  None the less a day of trying is better than the alternative"
581257,GBW,2011-05-10 02:58:00,8460,"hum, there are a few people here that can say that and I have fished with them and well, I have been one of them to say that. Well. you are on team 8, don't make me send you over to team 2..."
581262,Rod Caster,2011-05-10 03:03:00,5784, You might be able to trade me for a used bus or something.
581265,Nipfisher,2011-05-10 03:18:00,2449," If I had him on Team 2 I could show him my good spots. Now when I take him out on Nipissing I'll take him to my C,D, and E spots lol."
581266,ChrisK,2011-05-10 03:18:00,2772,"Naaaa,you don't suck..You just need to refine your methods a little...Lot of guys get frustrated with  steelhead at first but I bet if you spent a day with any one of our more successful steelheaders on this board you would pick up on a lot of little details you may have been overlooking."
581268,Rod Caster,2011-05-10 03:26:00,5784,"  You are exactly right Chris. I'm a Walleye/pike/speck guy at heart and only had access to steelhead waters as of last year. More practice, some mentoring and a wee bit of confidence will go a long way. I'm a persistent guy, so I'll learn quick. You'll see more positive reports out of me soon.  I had to vent though haha."
581269,GBW,2011-05-10 03:29:00,8460,"LOL!!!!!!!!!!!!   take him to Skeeter's spots!  No, wait, I gave him some recently..."
581271,dhickey,2011-05-10 03:37:00,1038,  WHAT?? GBW ??  I dont speak for the team but any one who is willing to put the effort into catching fish is OK in my book.. Send him over.
581280,Rod Caster,2011-05-10 08:43:00,5784, I definitely don't want to go to your A hole.
581281,cheaptackle,2011-05-10 09:11:00,849,Ya really didn't expect to strike gold the first time in a new area during a late spring didja? Pretend it's like last year when you were exploring my lake - ya had fun then!  Michael
581292,mercman,2011-05-10 10:47:00,7054,  Thats where the best fish are man !!!
581304,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2011-05-10 11:48:00,0,where abouts are you on Gitche Gumee?
581307,corvette1,2011-05-10 12:04:00,1765,i will take all of your fishing stuff i will pick it up at lakair thanks
581311,skeeter,2011-05-10 12:11:00,1907,"You dont suck, it's called a ""Slump"". Sooner or later, you will get over it."
581313,Rod Caster,2011-05-10 12:16:00,5784, Near Marathon tonight. I've mapped out three spots for the evening.
581314,splashhopper,2011-05-10 12:22:00,2931,"Hang in there bro. My first year steelie fishing, I got 18 !(3years ago) I thought it was easy peasy ! Last year I got SKUNKED.  This year I downsized my lures and line and am using an ultra light set up as well as drifting with longer flourocarbon leaders. The result, 4 bows and one brown landed so far. 2 lost. Keep at it. It can just as frustrating as it is rewarding."
581321,Nipfisher,2011-05-10 12:34:00,2449," Catch some nice ""Brown"" Trout.  How about my G spot?"
581324,skeeter,2011-05-10 12:39:00,1907,"I guess he will get over his slump on ""Hump Day""? All he has to do is figure out if he wants to go to the A Hole or the G spot!"
581327,skeeter,2011-05-10 12:41:00,1907,And NO you cant use crabs for bait!!!!!  :rofl2:
581341,Rod Caster,2011-05-10 13:26:00,5784," Exactly, last week I caught 3 on manitoulin, last fall I bombed at the notty and last spring I did 4 for 5 on superior.... These fish can be super easy or very frustrating, high risk high reward."
581380,Pikeslayer,2011-05-10 14:58:00,1443,Rod Caster- YOU'RE FIRED!!!!!  Slayer.  
581385,redskullz,2011-05-10 15:19:00,55,"  Lots, and lots of people fail to catch fall fish at the notty!! Keep trying and be persistant, you'll get some."
