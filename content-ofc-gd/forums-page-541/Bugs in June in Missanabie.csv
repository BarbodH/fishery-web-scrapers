581424,10point,2011-05-10 17:05:00,165,Heading up to Dog lake in Missanabie the week of June 13th-17th with my Son and my Dad. My Dad's friend has a retreat like center that is actually up for sale that we are staying at. He mentioned that the bugs might be bad at that time. What should I prepare for? Since we are getting free accomadations if it's too bad I guess we can just leave and go home.

581443,Roy,2011-05-10 18:27:00,13728,I'd be careful...how much does your son weigh?  You'll be fine. A little preparedness goes a long way.
