193229,DanTheMan,2008-04-28 01:32:00,257,Went to our Local Sportman show this weekend and pick up 3 bottles of these baits. I must say. they REALLY are reallistic.They are pretty new on the maeket and I was wondering if anybody seen or try them yet.  Here's what they look like  
193623,DanTheMan,2008-04-29 00:04:00,257,I guess nobody has seen them before
193625,irishfield,2008-04-29 00:07:00,26272,"Probably more just distancing themselves from the thread.... due to aformentioned ""personallity"" ! lol"
193629,DanTheMan,2008-04-29 00:18:00,257,Is that better now
193632,mbac31,2008-04-29 00:22:00,904,"I used these all last year. I got them from a friend of mine who passed away last fall. Serge!!  He swore by them. I used them for Walleye on Quinte. He gave me a few different colors and I still use them. The pink ones are killers on the smallies and Trout. They are better than a real leach. Great drop shotting bait as well. Make sure that bottle stays out of the sun though, they sem to go all weird if not. The walleye love them.  Serge gave me a prototype scent that some guy made for him in a bottle that smells something awfull but when put on these, well lets just say the cat is out of the bag. This bait is also deadly for ice fishing as well."

193855,AzuluSpookd,2008-04-29 15:31:00,348, Thats ridiculous. Sure hope that is not the case.
193877,irishfield,2008-04-29 17:41:00,26272,"Threads always go ""south"" when the aformentioned ""personality"" (that's no longer mentioned there) is mentioned in a thread. Dan saw the humour in it and removed it. Figured he may get some true product reviews that way."
193920,DanTheMan,2008-04-29 19:44:00,257," I didnt think it was a big deal, but I guess it was,Thats why I removed it."
194088,addict,2008-04-29 23:21:00,475,once u use one dont put it back in the jar.
580536,marrex_mike,2011-05-07 23:35:00,40,any updated info on these baits? anybody using them? anybody know any bait shops that carry these? any info would be appreciated.  thx
580553,Nipfisher,2011-05-08 00:25:00,2449,"Dan, The creator of those Slimers frequents the North Bay area (Redbridge is 20 minutes away) and Discount Tackle and Bait on Trout Lake Rd has had them for sale for about 5 years...maybe more. I have never used them but heard good things about them. The display at the store has some huge Lakers that were caught using them."
580556,marrex_mike,2011-05-08 00:33:00,40,  Dan's original post is from over 3 years ago
580572,thebigcatch,2011-05-08 01:18:00,138,  I like them they work good for bass and eyes.  I can get them for you
580577,Nipfisher,2011-05-08 01:28:00,2449,  Oops. Alright. I need to read the time stamp more often. lol
580924,rbaquial,2011-05-09 11:06:00,968,I always see Italo using them on his shows. I can never seem to find them. Would love to know if they're available in the GTA...
580958,BucktownAngler,2011-05-09 13:39:00,582, where are you located?
580970,thebigcatch,2011-05-09 14:10:00,138,  I'm located in Hamilton
581249,Nipfisher,2011-05-10 02:31:00,2449,I can get them easily here in North Bay.
581646,CanadianShark,2011-05-11 02:46:00,13,I am interested in trying them out  Do any stores carry them in the GTA
