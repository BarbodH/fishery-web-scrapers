Where would be the best place to target them from a canoe in that reigon?  Above the dam or below?  Any tips would be much apprecated. Im taking my 15 year old cousin out with me who lost his father a few years back... My uncle wayne tought me to fish when i was a kid...he won a few lake O samon tourneys back in the day....ive only ever consistently caught them up on the french and lets be honest in the  early fall thats like shooting fish in a barrel.  I just want to put him on fish if at all possible. Thanks in advance pm. Me if thats better.....
