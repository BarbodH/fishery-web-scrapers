I went for a drive to Nakina today and although I did'nt go right to Cordingley Lake, every other lake that I saw was ice free, or had a bit of loose ice crystals left on it. Tomorrow I have to go for another drive to one of the hydro dams on the Nipigon River, so I'll get to scout out my own stomping grounds. Sometimes I love my job.  Good luck, be safe, and have fun guys."
581513,solopaddler,2011-05-10 22:23:00,8605,  Thanks Dan. I actually talked to someone in Nakina yesterday who told me the same thing so you're just confirming it.  Long range forecast looks incredible too.
