I was out for 5 days including the Monday-Wednesday after opening weekend and had a blast fishing the creeks with a crew I fish with every opener.  I've been busy as heck since, and finally have time to toss up a report.  2 of us headed up on the friday to set up camp and get things ready for our stay.  We hiked a couple of rivers that day and watched a few fish rising to BWOs, which got us pumped up for the following morning.  A few shots from the trip.                        Hatches are really starting to come off now.  Another couple of weeks and the mayflies will be out in full force!  Can't wait for that!  I spent a couple of days this past weekend in the same area doing some filming for an Ontario Fly Fishing documentary we are putting together.  Hopefully I'll have a couple of trailers for folks to check out in the next few weeks.  We've been filming since last november and have a ton of awesome footage."
581333,lookinforwalleye,2011-05-10 13:02:00,4399,Very nice shots and ya get a big   for not ruining the photos with ugly swirls!!!
581337,fish_finder,2011-05-10 13:11:00,370,Thanks Bud.  I hate those bloody swirls too.  If people would just set up their shots so they don't include any 'evidence' it would be much better!
