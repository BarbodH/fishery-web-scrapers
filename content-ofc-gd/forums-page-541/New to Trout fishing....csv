Love the ""Tomatoes"" Crop Discovery Story/thread...I'll get to my profile pic another day.  As a life long Georgian Bay Fisherman who loves chasing Pike, Bass and Walleye with a lure I have no idea how to fish for trout. Just moved to Collingwood with the girlfriend and bought a 13' rod, so that's a good start! Been trying the mouths of rivers with a weight/swivel and worm full of air...no luck. canadian Tire Eggs...No Luck. Spent last nights dusk fishing Collingwood Harbor thinking the big brow logs swimming past were Trout. No no no...Found out today their Carp. At least it was a pretty sunset. I'm going crazy...Maybe river fishing with a fly rod is the challenge I seek...? Might try the river running through Creemore tomorrow, west of the town before Glen Huron's dam.  Reading u guys with your river caught Trout...so jealous.  I don't know if I'm asking for help or just bragging my woes. But if you have any tips, my profile pic with a trout involved is that much closer."
