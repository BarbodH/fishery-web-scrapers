581501,skinny,2011-05-10 22:01:00,442,Ok so it's my first big trout hooked it around 11:00 am about 10 min or less from my house got it drifting a worm.  I removed 3 other hooks from it and a bunch of line.  now tell me what you would have done with it  
581504,Joey,2011-05-10 22:06:00,9122,"Ummm, thrown in on the BBQ"
581507,aplumma,2011-05-10 22:12:00,6896,looks like dinner to me.   Art
581509,splashhopper,2011-05-10 22:16:00,2931,released it
581510,danbouck,2011-05-10 22:18:00,4380,"  Nice Job, dinner for sure"
581511,Joeytier,2011-05-10 22:19:00,3990,"yep.  having said that, it's tough to beat foil-wrapped steelhead on the bbq"
581515,SBCregal,2011-05-10 22:29:00,688,"butter, onion, lemon, salt, pepper"
581523,Freshtrax,2011-05-10 22:52:00,2215,Gotta realease the first one of the season...its a sacrifise to the fish gods...but the seccond one gets eaten
581526,bushart,2011-05-10 22:56:00,2628,It all starts with a cedar plank and a BBQ my son
581542,skinny,2011-05-10 23:25:00,442,well it wasn't my first trout of the season just my first real big one I kept it. with a meal on weekend in mind or if the smoker makes some real progress it might get inside it
581544,GBW,2011-05-10 23:30:00,8460,"better get working on that smoker then!  remember, make a good brine and it will take 24 hours of marinating before you smoke it for the best results."
581548,Billy Bob,2011-05-10 23:38:00,5865,Fillet it....freeze it if need be....smoke it and ENJOY it with some cold Canadian Beer....it don't get no better then that...
581550,Pikeslayer,2011-05-10 23:40:00,1443,Eat it! Eat it! Eat it!  Slayer    Did I say eat it????
581553,Pikeslayer,2011-05-10 23:46:00,1443,"   I'm sure you know, but it won't be fresh after tomorrow (latest). So if you're planning a weekend meal, take Billy Bob's advice.  Slayer"
581558,Billy Bob,2011-05-10 23:49:00,5865," Damn, I knew I should of said, SEND IT TO ME...."
581571,skinny,2011-05-11 00:30:00,442,well by the sounds of it it will be going in freezer for a day or so
581575,crappieperchhunter,2011-05-11 00:48:00,2582,Your first decent bow...congrats.  IMHO the best thing you could do would be release it. Bow's to me are pretty much inedible....probably my least favourite freshwater fish to eat of all the species I have caught.  Again nice catch and if you do eat it I hope you enjoy it. I personally do not enjoy them.
581584,GBW,2011-05-11 01:07:00,8460,"as per PM, make sure it is not frozen when in the brine for the smoker."
