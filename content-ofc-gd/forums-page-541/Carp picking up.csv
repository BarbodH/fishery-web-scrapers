580751,Roy,2011-05-08 22:31:00,13728,"With the flooding out this way, the carp are using the streets...probably looking for a store with corn. "
580764,MCTFisher9120,2011-05-08 23:03:00,3761,"At least your getting numbers. Are there any decent spot's around Oshawa,Whitby,Ajax area? Not sure if the carp world is as secretive but thought I would ask  Hope to see you get a 30lbr...wow I wouldn't mind the fight from a 10  Thanks for the write up,   MTBF"
580771,dhickey,2011-05-08 23:28:00,1038,Dont forget about us guys down by Humber /Etobicoke and Credit rivers. ON my target list for this year.  salty
580772,mike rousseau,2011-05-08 23:32:00,4661,I'm east... Near Cornwall...  I don't really know many areas to far away... Sorry
580773,mike rousseau,2011-05-08 23:33:00,4661, Ha... They can google the address of a local tsc and feed up large
580780,hammercarp,2011-05-08 23:55:00,964,"Frenchman's Bay, Whitby Harbour, Intrepid Park, Stone Street Park, Lake View Park, Darlington, Courtice Lakeshore Beach, Bowmenville Marsh. Just use google earth. All those places have carp."
580785,MCTFisher9120,2011-05-09 00:02:00,3761,Bowmanville and Lynn shores I remember had carp... I might need to go and get some canned corn an try not to eat it all while fishing...green giant canned corn...soo good
580893,Photoz,2011-05-09 03:21:00,792,"I hit Port Perry (Scugog) and fished off the park down behind the big Independent store from 06:00 to noon . . . .    flung at least 5+ pounds of corn and a pound of boilies out . . . .   never got a sniff . . . .    not another fisherman in sight? Signs there had been plenty of 'em there though . . .    I could have picked up at least 3  -  4 bags of garbage, but I only had 2 empty bags in the van. I'm gonna pick up a new package of bags and use 'em if I go back next weekend. Water is still VERY damn c c c  c  c   o l d, needs at least another 5  -  10 degrees to get 'em moving. Although it was quite warm there, a cold wind outta the north, and a storm front that had just moved through sure didn't help. I catch a lotta carp . . . .   my very BEST day was 18 . . . .    in about 8 hours, and they were hitting good . . . .    to bait up, get a big one on, and fight & land him, every 20 minutes is quite a feat . . . .    especially when the water's still cold . . . .  perhaps I could sign up for lessons? Do you buy your sweet corn by the 1 gallon bucket . . . .   must get VERY expensive?"
581258,mike rousseau,2011-05-10 03:00:00,4661,   That may be too much bait...  You want a lot of carp feeding and warm water temps(50+ degrees) for a pound of boilies and a couple pounds of corn in a few hours...  Also... You can use cow corn from a feed store... Most people boil it... I soak it in a bucket in the driveway for a week... This way the corn is softer...  And it's about 10-15 dollars for 40kg of dry corn...
581660,Photoz,2011-05-11 03:22:00,792,"I ALREADY have a 40 kilo bag of cow corn, which I boil in strawberry KoolAid, vanila & anise. Plus a 40 kilo bag of chicken scratch, 25 kilo of dry molasses, 25 kilos of (coarse) wild birdseed, 40 kilos of pig chop, 40 kilos of calf starter & 15 kilos of bread crumbs for my groundbait baitballs. Anything I missed? (P. S. Ya can't OVERFEED carp, there isn't enough food out there to fill 'em up!)"
581725,jediangler,2011-05-11 12:45:00,1923,Caught a couple in my kayak last Friday. 
581727,Roy,2011-05-11 12:58:00,13728,  Nice shot. Glad you're using the kill switch.
