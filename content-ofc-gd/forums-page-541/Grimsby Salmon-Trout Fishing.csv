581166,danbouck,2011-05-09 23:10:00,4380,I'm doing a lot of elevators at a marina in Grimsby (about time   ) and will probably be there on and off for the next year. Since I will be working 10' from the water and a boat ramp I might as well take the boat out a few times.  Question is: How far away from some decent salmon and trout fishing am I? Planning on taking the boat out of Long Point in a couple weeks for Lakair and will have a couple weeks to play on Lake O with it. Biting the bullet on some gear this week too.

There's quite a few browns taken off the pier by the old pump house this spring."

I was down  that way last friday morning for a couple hours and we went 6 for 9. Choho, chinnies, bows and browns. A nice size 35"" spawned out rainbow .............  that didn't fight. Some small cohos, teenager kings and some nice size browns reported."
