580689,danbouck,2011-05-08 18:42:00,4380,"I have to keep this somewhat short since I just got back last night from a week on the road. Jose, Radar and Vinnimon met me at the hotel in Belleville shortly after 10. We shared a few stories over some beers and got to sleep around midnight  Woke up at 4 and got ready to meet Lloyd (fishhunter) at his boat. Couldn't ask for a better day out there, not too cold not too hot.  Ended up getting 12 walleye and 1 pike for the day. The pictures will tell the story.  My fish ever Walleye      Vinnimon      Radar      Jose                      My pike as Lloyd was bringing in the gear    And the fishing machine    HUGE thanks to Lloyd for a great day on the water. He was constantly working on finding us fish and I will definitely be going out many many more times with him.    and to the boys that joined me on this day, couldn't have asked for better company    Dan"
