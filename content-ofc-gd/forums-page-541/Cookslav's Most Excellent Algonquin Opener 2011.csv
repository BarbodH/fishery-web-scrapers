580964,highdrifter,2011-05-09 14:00:00,2534,Most epic dude!  We managed to get in on the 28th..  Turnover pretty much happened on Sunday..  That was harry stuff you boys went through.  Glad all is well!  cheers
580986,torco,2011-05-09 14:33:00,656,Another great Algonquin opener report. Too bad about the weather overall but glad you made it out safe. I am pretty sure I have canoed the lakes you were at and I can attest that a strong wind just funnels down those lakes making for some scary moments. Of course it was July and hypothermia wasn't a concern.  Its funny though the trips with the crazy weather and adversity are the ones I remember the best and seem to share the most stories from.
581015,Spiel,2011-05-09 15:53:00,9065,I think your nuts but I'm okay with that....LOL  Truly hardcore!
581019,addy79,2011-05-09 16:00:00,573,thats awesome! soo jealous!
581058,ehg,2011-05-09 17:49:00,2666,Wow! Great write up of a surely memorable trip. Being the first group into Algonquin must have made the trip super special. Even though you weren't able to fish or camp as planned it still was an incredible experience overall. Gotta like using those Panther Martins for brookies. Excellent stuff!
581319,Cookslav,2011-05-10 12:33:00,1457, Ya it definitely gave the entire trip a bit more of a wilderness feel knowing we were the first and only people in the park for 2 days. probobly the first and last time it'll happen for us
580596,Cookslav,2011-05-08 02:36:00,1457,"Our Trip was definitely one of adversity this year. But we still managed to pulled off another great trip for the memory bank!  Traditionally I take this trip with My Dad, 4 brothers, My uncle and a cousin or Two, but as fate would have it my brother is getting married this month in Vegas and NONE of those guys have enough vacation time to pull this trip off before the wedding and having other prior commitments. However I am in a different boat with 5 weeks banked so I was not about to miss my annual opener trip!!! I’ve been tripping in Algonquin for 18 years, and over that time I have learned the spring time before the Black flies roam is by far my favourite time to be in the park, so there was simply no way I was going to miss out on this trip for a simple lack of good company. I initially began planning a solo trip, but as luck would have it a good friend of mine expressed interest in joining and a plan was born for a quartet. One of the guys joining us was a green horn, and had not only never been to Algonquin... He had never been in a canoe so I knew trip planning was going to have to include easier access. We planned our route accordingly and sat back waiting for the big day in the park to come which was set to be Wed, April 27th... Unfortunately for us mother nature had some plans of her own. On the 20th the Park issued a bulletin effectively cancelling all interior camping permits due to unsafe ice conditions until the 26th... In other words all the lakes were still frozen over. The Park service had a fly over scheduled to reassess the Ice conditions on the 26th so it would be short notice for us but if it got me into the park I'd take it. So I called the park Tuesday morning at 8am only to find out the fly over was cancelled due to poor weather conditions…. Our Trip was now in the air. Desperate to gain access I laid my cards on the table and told the gentleman in the planning office of my predicament, and asked if there was anywhere in the Park they “expected” to be open Wednesday. The fellow on the phone seemed sympathetic and informed me he had confirmation that the east gate lakes were open from a fellow co-worker but they still had “some” ice that could be navigated around. He said the road conditions were potentially an issue though and he'd call the sand lake gate to see if access was possible. 20 minutes later he called me back and confirmed that I would indeed be granted access to the east gate!!!! I called the guys, and told them of our destination change, and told them to get some sleep as we would now be leaving at 3am to combat the 6-7 hour haul.  After an unbelievably slow drive due to some of the thickest Fog I'd ever seen we made it to the Park gate by 10am...only to be told they would NOT issue me a permit to the interior as they were still closed due to unsafe ice conditions!!! I pleaded with the gentleman working the gate, and explained that I had confirmation yesterday, and we had just driven 7 hours to get there. I gave him the name of the guy who confirmed my plans but of course as my luck usually goes, the guy I spoke to over the phone was off Today. Luckily the Gate supervisor came by as we were about to go postal LOL!!!! He made me a deal I couldn't refuse…. He granted me access to a lake he knew was safe and that was as far as he would let me go, as he personally had seen the lake and it was safe. It was not the lake I wanted to go too But it was fair, and I was in no place to argue so we shook hands and I accepted. One VERY cool thing to note, On our way out he congratulated us on being the first people to dip a paddle this year, and told us to enjoy the 7600square km’s of Algonquin to ourselves for the next 2 days…..what a cool thought to start our trip!  We slowly ventured out into thick fog across our fist lake and it didn’t take long to find the ice. There were pads of ice floating here and there we had to circumvent and the odd patch of slush, but over all it was an easy paddle in. The air was thick, humid and warm so the ice cold water was creating A LOT of fog...it made the scenery very eerie, and mystical looking, which just added to adventure that much more. Finding Marked Portages was not an easy Task though….Luckily the water was glass calm between Showers, which made the canoeing easy, and after each shower the Fog would clear a bit so I suppose it compensated nicely.   We made camp in decent time, and went right to work getting our tarps and tent up as Rain was expected to intensify in the evening. The Site choices were small, and very sheltered or one nice Point not particularity sheltered but well treed, and other then a bit of rain the weather forecast was warm and calm so the scenic point is what we chose. There was a poorly built fire pit, but a nice set of tables built, and a 2 sets of make shift log benches in place so overall it seemed to be a nice spot. I quickly built the fire pit up, and found a long flat stone to cover the pit giving us a bit of and oven.. I figured we would need some shelter in the pit with the rain forecast.     When lifting rocks to build up the Fire Pit I found this little guy.  I have not had seen a salamander up close since I was a kid...I guess unless you go looking for them they can be hard to miss?  We trolled around a bit that first night in the fog before the rain hit...that was an adventure LOL! As luck would have it I had just seen a depth chart on this lake only 2 weeks ago, and made a mental note about an off shore hump. So after a few quick paddle trolls around the lake to get some casting ideas for tomorrow we headed out to the hump...that was an eerie situation as at one point as we couldn’t see land in any direction. I was not worried about getting lost as there were only 3 creeks leading in or out of the lake so even if I got turned around as long as I continued to circle the lake I would eventually get back to camp. Well....ya we got lost LOL!!! My Canoe partner at one point asked ""where are we?"" and of course I responded ""just south of camp...don’t worry"" 30 minutes later when we ran into another slush field, and ice pack... I had to admit we were no where near camp, and were in fact headed north LOL!!! So we trolled in the other direction, and made it back without issue. But it’s the first time I have ever been that turned around in the fog. I can only surmise we somehow got turned around in the middle of the lake while we had no visibility??? On our way back the Skies opened up into a down pour that had me bailing the canoe...so we called it a night and settled in for the evening fire.   Thursday morning was a beautiful one, misty, calm and mild.  we had NO idea what was in store for us… We spent the morning having coffee, and oatmeal while we devised our plan of attack. We wanted Speckled trout for dinner as we had craved it, and talked about it to the point of godliness over the last 2 months and we were now hell bent on getting some. We hastily searched for some fire wood to get us through the night...it was apparent good dry wood was in short supply as the winter had just released the ground from her winter snow pack in the last 2 days. So finding wood that didn't require cutting and splitting was not a common find. After seeking and finding what we thought was an ample supply of wood we set out to get some fish. I think taking the time to grab some wood may have saved us a huge headache and quite possibly even our lives...  As we began to load the canoes to head out I noticed the wind was picking up a bit, and I commented to the guys that I didn’t like the look of the sky to the south west….I suggested we stay close, and keep an eye on the sky. We didn’t make it more then 30 minutes before the breeze became a gale! The wind POUNDED us with gusts that I could only guess were pushing 90km/hour Only after we left the park did I find out the area was wind swept with thunderstorms, Tornado’s and wind gusts in excess of 120km/hour. We battled our way back to camp directly into the wind, and surf. 10 minutes into the barrage of 2' cresting swells I made the call to cache the canoes and walk to camp through the woods. It was simply to dangerous in the frigid waters.   I was doing ALL I could to keep us from capsizing, and we were taking on water with every 2nd or 3rd wave….our other boat had a ghost white Newbie in it LOL! So I am very confident that we made the right decision. We made it back to camp to find our tarp shelter Barely hanging on...we quickly used some of our uncut longer logs and made an X support between the trees and re-tied the Wind breaks, and did the same over head. Then it happened...the winds got stronger with a passing Thunderstorm!!! My Hennessey Hammock snapped 2 strings from the Fly, and was barely hanging on as was the other hammocks in the group. We ran our butts off  in the wind and rain to secure the Hammocks, and shelter with new ropes, and rocks...it was the most frantic moment I’ve ever seen in the Park. Trees were snapping, limbs flying, rain, hail, lightning and thunder we had it all. Sorry...but Pictures at this point were the LAST thing on my mind. Simply getting our Hammocks down, and tarps secure was most important…  The crazy part is the wind was sustained at about 40km/hour or more for hours. It never really let up until sun down and even then the wind remained gusty and chilling until morning. We were completely and utterly wind bound...no fishing took place this day. Instead we spent half the day securing and wind proofing our camp, and the other half making the best of the situation by splitting, and sawing enough wood for the next 2 nights.  Friday was dreary, foggy and cool but calm.  We ate quickly, grabbed a coffee and headed out. After working our base lake to no avail we elected to try a near by stocked Lake. It was one punishing portage, but we had only fishing gear and a canoe so it wasn’t to bad. The decision proved to be a good one.   We entered the lake and were immediately greeted by crystal clear emerald green water, with shore structure that screamed “specs”   It Didn’t take long… I literally had a feisty speck on the line with my first cast. The fish “inhaled” my Number 4 Panther Martin(silver blade, body, and red Hackle)    And fought like a champ & even had an uncharacteristic jump and spit a fair sized leech at me LOL!!!! She was definitely a keeper, as the hooks were deep in the gills with lots of damage...she reeely inhaled it. Sorry about the blood, but it’s the ONLY picture I was able to take before heading back to camp as my battery died, and my spare was in my pack at camp.  We proceeded to work the structure over the next 3 hours, and managed to land 14 fish. All fish came on Silver bladed  number 4 -5 spinners(Mepps, Panther Martin, blue Fox) on a slow retrieve. Some with red Hackle, some with Yellow. Fish were taken from fallen logs every time, but in most cases the hits came from deep in about 15-20’ of water, and many hits were late and quite close to the boat….which made for exciting visuals!!! In some cases I could see the fish come out from under the log and follow it right up to the boat before turning….very very cool! We kept 4 for the pan and headed home to find the other boat kept 2.  So we ate like kings, and felt pretty deserving after yesterdays weather bomb kept us wind bound at camp. We did half Butter poached and half with basic regular fish crisp…it was worth every minute of the wait.    That night was a party LOL! We enjoyed warmer, dryer weather and had a great feast...and we finished the last of our adult beverages. And crashed early.   Saturday I was well rested from an early night, and got up early enough to capture the sunrise.   We packed up and headed home in blue skies through glass calm waters….it was tough to leave in suck nice conditions, but also nice to have such easy conditions on the way out. During a stop while looking for a place to ….errr….relieve ones self One of the guys made a cool discovery.  I guess this girl had a run in with the local wolves… I’ve never noticed the teeth on a moose before, but wow….I wouldn’t want to get bit LOL!!!!   Also cool to note…There was still ice to be seen in the park even on the way out.      One funny thing about coming in to the park so early...was leaving so early On the way out it was quite funny to see the looks on peoples faces as they were coming in...some looked shocked to see people coming out  considering there had been a ban on interior camping, others looked down right Mad...as if they were insinuating we were camped illegally. I can’t blame them for thinking so, and to be honest it actually made the trip feel even more special LOL!  Over all the trip was exhilarating… We saw the Gauntlet of weather she can throw at us, we saw a lot of natural beauty many people don’t get to see, and although the fishing was limited to a few hours Wed, and Friday, it was stellar!!!  Can’t wait to get back out! Cheers,"
580607,Nipfisher,2011-05-08 03:07:00,2449,Great report. Beauty specs. It is a magical place. What is the string on the skull?
580608,Cookslav,2011-05-08 03:10:00,1457,"No idea...I think some one may have tied it up? It was at a site, so someone probobly found it, and ""intended"" to pack it out for a keepsake but either changed their mind, or forgot it?"
580614,Joey,2011-05-08 03:53:00,9122,"Excellent and entertaining report.  Really enjoyed that.  You are all lucky to make it through what Mum Nature threw your way.  Looks like a really tasty fish fry and that green water is amazing.  Love the skull, really cool find.  Joey"

580632,spincast,2011-05-08 11:13:00,3279,"Fantastic report, and nice specs. The day of fishing was nice pay back for all that work. I've been camping in similar conditions to the storm (although thankfully not on the water in a canoe, that would be interesting) back when the tornado went through Barrie in the 90's I was at Arrowhead. Trees falling everywhere, including on a few tents with people in them. A few ended up going to hospital with broken bones and other injuries. Ya just gotta batten down the hatches, hold on an hope the trees around you stay up! Glad you guys came through with just memories. Awesome pics of the day after on the water - I love it when it is dead silent except for the birds, the plash of the paddle and the spinner hitting the water - then wham! fish-on"
580634,splashhopper,2011-05-08 11:24:00,2931,"awesome report Cooks.... That storm must have scared the crap out of the newbie and he was lucky to have a responsible ""guide"" like u there to make decisions based on safety first"

A lot more uncertainty & adversity...a lot less fishing, but totally a trip to remember.   Agreed... So many trees came down it was ridiculous. Even on the ride home we had to pass 3 gas stations before we found one with power, and that was 2 almost 3 days later. Hydro crews were every where, and I don't think we saw consistent power service until Bancroft???  Saw a few cottages/Dock/dock houses that were smashed up on the way home by Barry's bay... They got hit hard."
