580905,ehg,2011-05-09 04:48:00,2666,Got out fishing today for first time in seven months. Almost forgot how much i like getting out there. Had a ton of fun just being on the water. Figured would try throwing in-line spinners and minnowbaits for some Kawartha pike that are now open all year. Luckily some fish were caught to make the day. Bunch of small pike my buddy Dave caught...     Caught this crappie on a x-rap which was unusual i thought.   Nice way to spend a Sunday afternoon. Time just flew by out there.  Cheers. ehg

581074,ehg,2011-05-09 18:38:00,2666,"Thanks for replies!  First outing of the year came late but constant action smoothed it all out. Very few boats were out there which made things relaxing. Never fished this place before so learning the area was cool too.  Trolling Pigeon for muskies should be good this summer when the time works out. Thanks Shayne  Yup way too long. Even making this trip was a physically challenge for me. For better or worse, oxycontin made this day possible  Pumped for more fishing in the near future."
