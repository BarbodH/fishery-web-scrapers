581478,redskullz,2011-05-10 20:56:00,55,"I wasnt able to get out on opening day but we got out on the sunday the day after opener....we walked a few km through some nasty bush and got a number of small trout(brookies and bows). We spotted a few large spawners but they were acting very, very spooky and in the rough country and the tiny river getting good positioning on them without spooking them was very difficult. Right near the end of the river i hooked into this beauty 25"" male on my medium light Abu Garcia 6lb test trilene big game and a #3 mepps silver spinner.        The country is harsh for sure, but thats what i love about it.  Total people on the river that sunday = 0  Total deer carcasses seen = 4  Total live deer seen = 4  Total Grouse seen = 6    With beautiful scenery like this waterfall, the rough country is so worth trekking through.(my apologies for my camera settings....i had it on indoor mode...doh)        What a great outing!!"
