482581,cuzza,2010-07-05 17:09:00,467,"LOL @ 16lbs!!  If it is a 51 then he's a very big lad for 14! If he's lying then he knows it and the catch means nothing.  FWIW, this IS a 51lb carp albeit a mirror, not a grass carp and the guy holding it is a 6ft plus beanpole  "
482633,Whitespinnerbait,2010-07-05 19:55:00,2038,If that fish is 51 Lbs ..then all the Bass I catch are 10lbers...
482721,Marko,2010-07-05 23:36:00,854,"When i first looked at the fish i knew it wasn't 51 pounds or whatever the article says. That was couple of days ago lol. here is the fish i got last weekend, measured 35 inches and not more then 25lb. Keep in mind I am 6 foot 4 and my waist size is 36 and i am holding the fish few inches from my body.  "
482732,fish-miester,2010-07-06 00:04:00,864,hmm then i wonder how much these two that me and my buddy caught a week or so ago weighed... but like  camillj said im more interested in the laker  
482746,4thgen,2010-07-06 00:45:00,157,"The longest carp that I've caught was a 41"" by 28"" and it was around 30lbs. Carp will hit lures, but very occasionally. I've caught one on a Mepps #5 and one on a Mepps #3, both inside the mouth. I watched the one on the Mepps #3 actually hit it.  On another note, I used to solely use 1"" white grubs on 1/64th jig heads and 4lb line for sight fishing carp."
481935,danc,2010-07-03 15:08:00,4677,Read about it HERE
481937,TC1OZ,2010-07-03 15:16:00,987, I bet he snagged it with that rapala lure.  Or that carp isn't afraid of anything and attacks aggressively....
481938,Roy,2010-07-03 15:16:00,13728,51 pounds eh?
481939,Leecher,2010-07-03 15:18:00,7832,Amazing..... 25 minute fight Congrats to the young angler
481943,Terry,2010-07-03 15:35:00,14456,"this 14 year old is 6 ' 8"" 220 lbs ?"
481944,TC1OZ,2010-07-03 15:39:00,987, Where did you find those stats? lol
481946,Terry,2010-07-03 15:42:00,14456,well I thought the fish looked like a real small 51lbs  so I figured it looked small because the 14 year old kid was real big making the fish look small.......  I mean it's written in a newspaper that it's 51 lbs so it must be........
481951,TC1OZ,2010-07-03 15:53:00,987, hahaha because media is full of facts right?
482095,jediangler,2010-07-04 02:01:00,1923,He must be a giant kid cause that fish doesn't look 30lbs let alone 51lbs.
482101,Duckie,2010-07-04 02:25:00,305,"exactly. to me, it looks 25 pounds at best. big fish, but not 51 pounds. I have caught legit 30 pounders (out of Lake Ontario) and they loo notably bigger than the fish in the pic.."
482112,kickingfrog,2010-07-04 03:01:00,8333,"Relax guys, the kid doesn't post here, the article is from a paper that is 2 time zones away from most of us and in another country. The world is still safe."
482136,camillj,2010-07-04 05:21:00,1988,What I was really hoping to see was the 50 lb laker his Carp beat out
482142,Terry,2010-07-04 09:51:00,14456,I don't think anyone was getting wound up about it  and I don't see the problem with stating our opinion  so relax no one was gathering with pitchforks to run him out of town
482144,TC1OZ,2010-07-04 09:55:00,987," Stating opinions, which is what was clearly done in the news paper. I wonder if anyone checked it for lead weights in the belly. And why has no one commented on the carp hitting a rapala dive-to lure? Did they actually take it to an official scale and more than one person verify it?  Sounds like a fishing story that made the local paper if you ask me."
482190,kickingfrog,2010-07-04 13:16:00,8333,"Tilt away then. The Tour de France is in Holland right now as well. Say ""hi""."
482256,Duckie,2010-07-04 17:07:00,305," because it happens occasionally.  I have been fishing at Bronte with a friend of mine who caught and landed a big carp that ate his rattlin rapala like popcorn. right in the side of the mouth.  I have caught and landed them on a normal jig with a mr. twister tail on the back, same thing.  sometimes, they do chase down and eat lures and jigs.  just not very often."
482364,Burtess,2010-07-04 22:22:00,901,I netted a rainbow off a Lake O pier this morning that would be about the size of that fish......... (yes they are in shallow...)  Burt
482368,Twocoda,2010-07-04 22:34:00,4130,probably a ploy to get people to come to Colorado to fish...i always thought the camera was supposed to add 10 pounds....not remove 35....looks about 16 at best ....oh i just thought of it ...its a typo and it was 15 not 51
482381,BillM,2010-07-04 22:58:00,17367,"If I'm going to Colorado, I'm definitely not fishing for those over sized goldfish!!"
482393,OhioFisherman,2010-07-04 23:22:00,6623,"http://www.myoan.net/fishing/weight_calc.html  Never caught a grass carp, but carp on lures, and not snagged. A few of them longer than the yard stick I kept in the boat by a good deal. Never guessed at any of mine over 35. Possibly? but it doesn`t look that big in the pic."
482481,Rick2,2010-07-05 11:43:00,15,25 lbs. of fish 26 lbs. of imagination.
482483,danbouck,2010-07-05 11:51:00,4380,More like 6 lbs of fish and 45 lbs of imagination!
482486,Roy,2010-07-05 12:08:00,13728,This is Donald Walker's 50 pound laker from Colorado. 
482558,Terry,2010-07-05 16:29:00,14456,so I stand corrected and I should not have said anything I am sure everyone agrees that that carp looks bigger then that trout       LOL:sarcasm:
482568,Roy,2010-07-05 16:53:00,13728,"Just a parentheses here...as I posted the pic of the 50 pound lake trout it occurred to me that that fish could possibly be a triploid. I know that many states are heavily involved in triploid production in order to boost the economics of the fishing industry. Washington State is a leader in this. So, for those of you who know about these things, would the laker pictured above fit the description?"
