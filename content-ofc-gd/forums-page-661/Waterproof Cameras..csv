482709,scugpg,2010-07-05 22:44:00,1373,Just thought I'd chime in here as its been a few months since I started this thread.  I went with the Sony TX5 with a $59.99 class10 memory card from Future shop and its been awesome! Really easy to use and takes nice pics. Super slim as well. Give this one a strong consideration if you want a great camera that happens to be really thin and water/shock/dustproof  http://www.sonystyle.com/webapp/wcs/stores/servlet/ProductDisplay?catalogId=10551&storeId=10151&langId=-1&productId=8198552921666122654
444677,ColdH20guy,2010-03-17 15:36:00,312,"Hey gang My daughter is turning 19 next week and is going to Hawaii with her mom and guess what she wanted..yep a waterproof camera! I went to Future Shop today and they had a cheaper Olympus on display. The sales guy said they just  got 3 new models in yesterday to go on sale Friday (when he checked they only had 2 left) but was able to sell one today.. It is the Olympus tough 6020 with HD movie capability etc etc. It was 349.00 so I picked it up as I didnt want to try to 3-4 different places and up back there...not sure if it will be any good but she is leaving on Saturday morning.. here's a link..any thoughts ? Oh yeah, it takes a regular SD card which helps too... thanks guys Rich http://mandurahcamerahouse.com.au/olympus-...020-p-2254.html"
444828,BillM,2010-03-17 23:40:00,17367,"Rich, you have 15 days to return it if it's a piece of crap.  For that price I would have bought the Canon D10..  Same price at Henrys."
444831,ColdH20guy,2010-03-17 23:50:00,312,damn Bill...now you got me wunderin'  hmmmm maybe I will look at others tomorrow.....the fuji one that mercer advertises looked okay but I dont think its out yet...
444835,BillM,2010-03-17 23:56:00,17367,The D10 is pretty much the cream of the crop as far as waterproof cameras go..   I've taken advantage of Futureshops return policy on a few occasions when I've found a better deal or something I liked better.
444839,scugpg,2010-03-18 00:01:00,1373, There are only 2 things that are stopping me from buying the D10:  1. Not compact 2. Only does VGA video  Other than that its the best one out there.  I'm probably going to wait a month as the new models are slowly coming out. The 6020 looks decent though by the specs!
444841,ColdH20guy,2010-03-18 00:03:00,312,do you know who else carries it? i'm in orillia.....thanks  I think it looks good too..movies in HD seems cool..
444862,Dave Mercer,2010-03-18 00:41:00,148,"Hey Gang, Just thought I would let you know that we will be giving away two of the brand new Fuji waterproof XP 10's at my seminar this weekend at Bass Pro Shops Saturday and Sunday at 2pm. So if you need one it might be a good chance to get one for FREE. We have that and a ton of other crazy things going on so please swing by and see me this weekend. Dave  P.S if you are coming swing by early as J.P's seminar is at 1 pm right before mine."
444870,ColdH20guy,2010-03-18 01:06:00,312,thanks Dave although 'chance' and 'might' dont seem to hold high hopes!! lol still dont know what to do!?! Rich
444944,denisk,2010-03-18 11:55:00,163,DAve no shamrocks and NY bass this year    the ramp in crystal beach is wide open
444946,Dave Mercer,2010-03-18 11:57:00,148,That would have been awesome! I missed it
445113,ColdH20guy,2010-03-18 20:19:00,312,"okay so I venture into town and promptly return my $500 purchase to Future Shop (included extended warranty, new sd card etc etc) and at least feel better for the time being..Its amazing what a good nights sleep can do to impulse buying.. I wander into Shoppers and they just happen to have the Fuji WP Z33 on sale that they just got in..(I know its not the brand new one but...)  $149 instead of $199..sold!  I think it will be more than adequate for what she needs..looks pretty cool too if you like green,,which she does!! thanks guys Rich  maybe see some of you at the show on saturday!"

445365,scugpg,2010-03-19 11:57:00,1373,"Can't wait till the new reviews come out, here's a summary of a popular one:  http://www.dpreview.com/reviews/Q209waterp...roup/page17.asp"
453281,scugpg,2010-04-08 01:17:00,1373,The Panasonic TS2 is now on the shelves and looks very impressive.  Sony TX5 comes out in a couple weeks and looks to be the top camera so far; with the TS2 very close. $350-$399 range  XP10 should be out soon as well $199 and Olympus has a $99 camera out now that is waterproof.  Gonna keep waiting till they all come out to have a hands on look at em'
453428,Cudz,2010-04-08 05:05:00,2652,I beg to differ.  I have one and I also have a sony 12.1 mega pix camera.  The olympus is good for underwater shots but the sony is much better for every other shot.  I also had a 7.2 maga pix sony that got wet and fried that was superior in almost everyway to the olumpus. Problems with my olympus include a very slow shutter speed which cause lots of blurry pics.  Poor and very grainy pics when taken indoors.  The stabilizer is inferior to that of the sony cameras. That is just my opinion. To tell you the truth I have a 9 year old cannon axis camera that is 2.1 mega pixels.  It cost me around $1000 9 years ago.  I still have that camera and it takes better indoor pics than my olympus. The pics are never blurry either.  No kidding.
453508,carp-starter,2010-04-08 13:25:00,253,The Fuji XP10 sounds like a good camera but it has big problems.  Here is a review -  http://www.digitalcamera-hq.com/products/fuji-finepix-xp10  carp-starter
453518,Aaron Shirley,2010-04-08 14:08:00,655,"Kodak has a new waterproof pocket HD video camera out. It takes great underwater video with sound. It also takes still shots, but not sure how the still shots will be compared to cameras designed more for stills. I'll report on it later in the year."
453557,fish_d00d,2010-04-08 15:25:00,38,"I have an Olympus Stylus-550WP that I got for about $160 last year. The quality is decent for both video and stills. Took it to snorkeling in Hawaii and Thailand, and have dunked it in local lake water. Works great and cheap for recreational use. Only prob with Olympus is they take exclusive types of memory cards, which you need to buy separately."
454316,scugpg,2010-04-10 16:26:00,1373,"Had a chance to look at some new models today and I must say the Sony TX5 looks like the winner at this point.  Panasonic TS2 is nice as well, but when you see how slim the TX5 is and its great features (including touch screen LCD, 10fps burst, panoramic mode) it seems a no-brainer. Both are in the $350 range. These are the cameras to consider if you want a great camera that happens to be 4-proof. I'd say the Olympus 6020 would be 3rd if I had to choose. Note the Sony is only waterproof to 10ft though.  Saw the XP10 as well, it looks alright but it seemed pretty slow and bulky compared to the others. There is an Olympus at Futureshop around the $99 range also. These are the cameras you want to consider that will take a beating at the beach/fishing but you have another camera to take the quality photos.  Open to more thoughts on real-life experiences on these cameras."
454324,BillM,2010-04-10 16:36:00,17367,How many times have I mentioned the Canon D10?  I'll mention it again though
454352,scugpg,2010-04-10 18:14:00,1373," Its a good camera I should've mentioned it, but it doesn't do HD video and its not as portable like the rest.  Takes great photos though from what I read."
454360,DRIFTER_016,2010-04-10 18:27:00,10439,"  Yep, they are great cameras for sure Bill, but drop it in the water and it instantly becomes a paper weight. That is unless you spend $200 on a waterproof housing for it.  I have just replaced my 7 year old Olympus Stylus 300, with a Stylus SW 1050. While it isn't as crisp as the Canon it is waterproof, shockproof and it takes pretty decent pictures and the cost was very reasonable. The video and stills in this video were shot with it a week or so ago.  Olympus Stylus SW 1050 Video"
454363,BillM,2010-04-10 18:42:00,17367, The Canon D10 is waterproof  
454390,DRIFTER_016,2010-04-10 20:59:00,10439,"  Oh yeah, OOPs, I forgot they finally made a waterproof job.  Actually my post was just a shameless ploy to get more hits on my video so that I may win Trophy Clips spring video contest."
438813,scugpg,2010-03-02 02:37:00,1373,I just discovered the D10 doesn't do audio while recording videos

438834,Cudz,2010-03-02 04:30:00,2652,You can use a mini SD card in the Olympus. No need for the XD.  I have used the miniSD and it is fine (there is an adaptor that comes with the camera)
439235,mepps,2010-03-03 13:46:00,1301,"Canon D10 for sure!  Scugog: you may want to check your settings, it mosdef does audio on the videos..."

439373,Ryan Landry,2010-03-03 20:23:00,128,BTW I love this camera! 
439374,kickingfrog,2010-03-03 20:27:00,8333,Wow! Imagine the size of the smallmouth you could catch with crayfish that size.  Nice photos.
439389,BUSTER,2010-03-03 20:49:00,1336, FUJI- Z33 worked for me 2 Straight days at the waterpark.........
439401,scugpg,2010-03-03 21:21:00,1373, I later verfied this I apologize.  I was checking out the D10 today and Dell has them for $299 shipped!!!  Panasonic TS1 is nowhere to be found and $100 more so i might just opt for the D10.  If I need something compact that does HD video the new Iphone is supposed to have both.
439466,steelhead197,2010-03-04 00:30:00,38,Olympus Stylus SW1030.......Mint!
439469,trevy727,2010-03-04 00:42:00,351,  That's not correct. I've taken videos and it has great audio.
439494,the spirit of fishing,2010-03-04 01:23:00,141,"I ran accross an Olympus camera in Liquidation World 2 days ago;just happened to notice it. I believe it was a Stylus 500,said it was waterproof to 3 metres. Price was $110.00,I noticed it while I waited for a friend to get through the lineup and he was done before I could check it out any further. It was definately a point and shoot,it may not be the latest model or what you're looking for but the price looked pretty good. I have a Stylus 740 I bought from the Olympus ebay site a few years ago and it continues to serve me well(when I remember it....lol)."
439500,Dave Mercer,2010-03-04 01:31:00,148,"Hey Gang, If you are looking for a new underwater camera you may want to hold off for a few weeks. Fuji has a brand new one coming out called the XP 10 this thing is awesome. It's water proof, dust proof, freeze proof and shock proof you can drop it! I think this was made for all anglers its 12mega pix and it's only going to sell for $200. I don't often talk about product on here but this one is awesome. After using the WP Z33 last year I did not think it could get better but it has."

439625,scugpg,2010-03-04 11:30:00,1373," I just looked it up this thing does 720p video, 5x optical and does zoom while recording video as well. For $200 it's definitely worth considering...assuming the image stabilization is decent.  I'll hold off for a bit I think. Between this one and whatever new ones come out shortly it might be worth the wait.  Thanks Dave for the camera FYI."
439632,Twocoda,2010-03-04 11:56:00,4130,   great heads up Dave....does your camera man concur?
443415,kickingfrog,2010-03-13 18:11:00,8333,FYI gang. Shoppers drugmart is selling the Fugi z33 wp for $150. I assume they are getting ready for the new version Dave mentioned. Looks like neon lime is the only colour if that matters to you.
443419,scugpg,2010-03-13 18:23:00,1373,I think I'm going to hold out for the Panasonic TS2 or the Fuji XP10. TS2 is more money but it is a much more versatile camera.  I'm itching to see them but no new models are on shelves yet. Probably another month.
443421,fish-miester,2010-03-13 18:29:00,864,I baught my gf the FUJI-Z33 WP cause we love fishing and camping. and well plus shes a blonde so I knew it would get dropped a few times and well the camera has worked great!  good quailty pictures and very easy to use!  I personaly think im going to buy myself one this spring or summer just not in pink
443422,The Urban Fisherman,2010-03-13 18:29:00,2050," I may or may not have a prototype of the camera in my office as we speak....   It's freakin awesome! haha I was so happy when the Z33 came out because as much as I love my job, the last thing I want to do when I'm out on the water fun fishing is lug around a big camera and camera bag. (Not complaining Dave lol)  Couple that up with the fact that I have 2 young kids who love to play with the camera while we're fishing and these are a perfect fit!  The new features on the XP are exactly what I was hoping for when I heard they were coming out with a new one!  It's so simple to use my 3 year old can take pictures of my fish while we're out, but has advanced enough features for me to get creative with it when I want to.  You won't be disappointed!  Cheers, Ryan"
443424,BUSTER,2010-03-13 18:31:00,1336,"_   That little camera is great guys , and even better for that price.....I was playing with it last night while smoking some lake trout"
443425,scugpg,2010-03-13 18:31:00,1373," I want to see what its ""Digital Image Stabilization"" can do, I agree they really have packed many features into this $200 camera."

437849,scugpg,2010-02-27 19:23:00,1373,Hi all - I was wondering what you guys like for waterproof cameras.  I've been looking into the Olympus 550wp/560wp as well as their higher end cameras (Stylus tough series)  I've also considered the Fuji Z33 and the Canon powershot D10.  What have you guys used? Looking for some insight from folks who are out there in the waders/boats using them
437852,BillM,2010-02-27 19:44:00,17367,Are you looking to use this as a normal camera also?  If so nothing touches the Canon D10.
437853,denisk,2010-02-27 19:46:00,163,The Olympus Stylus 1030 SW  is bullet proof.  The video recording sound sucks but the camera is well worth every $.  I've ruined lots of cameras but this one sits in the river while I unhook steelhead.  Even in dirty water  
437855,uglyfish,2010-02-27 19:47:00,981,"i have the fuji z33, my gf got it for me for xmas after my camera broke and she seen dave mercer had one.. lol.  but i love the camera, works great had a ton of settings for any type of shooting condition. great picture quality. and its a nice price point."
437857,solopaddler,2010-02-27 19:57:00,8605,I have the Olympus Stylus 790SW. It's a great camera but not just a simple point and click. It has numerous functions that need to be utilized in order to maximize your pictures. Unfortunately I don't have the time or patience to learn them all so many of my shots are mediocre.
437864,BUSTER,2010-02-27 20:25:00,1336,"I have the fuji z33 and just love it, we took the kids to niagra falls indoor water park, took video going down the slides, pics, video of the kids swimming underwater...just awsome...used it last wk-end out on simcoe in the hut, no issues I had it sitting out in the cold on the tri-pod didnt effect it at all...used it at the metalica and guns and roses concert in-door video worked great ,bought an 8gig sd card and good to go...Great little camera, lots of options.."
437865,BUSTER,2010-02-27 20:26:00,1336,Oh i paid $199 @ wal-mart..

437875,scugpg,2010-02-27 21:04:00,1373, I would like to cover all my bases with one camera if possible.
437876,pike slayer,2010-02-27 21:08:00,1177,i just picked up the olympus stylus tough 6000. first time having it out today taking pics! it did a great job!! i got mine on ebay new for $160
437884,trevy727,2010-02-27 21:47:00,351,I love my canon power shot D10. It takes fantastic underwater and out of water photos and videos. Here are a few from mexico. We were about 25' away from the crocadile/caymin and the picture was taken through a window with no cropping done.   
437885,Paully,2010-02-27 21:52:00,712,I got a Olympus Tough 6000.. Works great and many cool features to mess around with. They have an opiton for panoramic photos that works well too.  Its shockproof waterproof(up to 3 meters) and freezeproof. so far i am real happy with it. 
437901,Cudz,2010-02-27 22:31:00,2652,I have a stylus tough 6000 and am not overly impressed with it.  Slow shutter speed and seems to result in lots of blurry pics.  Not nearly as good quality shots as my sony.
437904,Paully,2010-02-27 22:35:00,712,"I had 2 sony cameras before this one.. One got wet and the other prolly got bumped around too much.. We'll see what the ""tough"" can take.."
437907,DRIFTER_016,2010-02-27 22:58:00,10439,"I have an Olympus Stylus 300 that I purchased in 2003. I was so impressed with it I have just replaced it with a Stylus 1050SW. Back in 2003 the Olympus stylus was the first digicam that claimed to be water resistant (not waterproof). Well on a couple of occasions it was tested for it's water resistant capabilities, once sliding down a class I whitewater chute and once when I flipped my one man cat. Solopaddler was there for that one.   After he helped me and my stuff to shore, I took  the camera out of my pocket and took a picture. It worked perfectly. I figure if a camera that was not billed as waterproof worked that well, one that is billed as waterproof should be awesome!! I picked it up from Olympus direct through their ebay store  for $112. The best thing, shipping is only $4.95!!!"
437953,carp-starter,2010-02-28 00:56:00,253,"I do not have a waterproof camera but I would like to buy one. I started to investigate at the time the Canon D10 came out. I have a D80 Canon which is not waterproof.  I checked on the Olympus, and I think that Pentax has one. Fuji I would never buy and so I know nothing about it.  My choice was going to be the D10. But the price at that time was $399,99 at Henry's. Future was more by 30 bucks and Vistek was the same as Henry's.  I decided to wait for a price drop. It is now $349.99 at Henry's and Vistek. The last time I looked, Future shop no longer sells it. But then Future does not sell other cameras that it used to sell.  Now I am in no rush - I will wait longer.  I have checked on reviews. Apparently the one camera that produces the best quality photos is the Canon D10. Perhaps Olympus when it goes to the next step of waterproof cameras, the results will be better than now. If the photo quality by Olympus were better, I would choose Olympus because I like the shape - it is more practical. You can put it into a pocket. With the D10, it is difficult to put a football shaped camera into a pocket.  This is all I have.  Good luck.  carp-starter"
437976,kickingfrog,2010-02-28 02:13:00,8333,"I'll be buying a waterproof point and shoot this month before going on vacation.  Here is a site I've been using to help me deside:  http://www.dpreview.com/  I'm leaning toward the powershot D10, but I wish it was smaller, since this will be my beach camera and all I wear is a speedo.  Anymore firsthand reviews?"
437979,Twocoda,2010-02-28 02:21:00,4130,  we will take your word for it ....no proof is required...  please please please dont post pics

I have a Canon SD780IS and will be picking up the waterproof case from Canon ($160)..  Expensive for a case, but the pics that sucker will take under the water will be amazing!"
438027,Paully,2010-02-28 05:18:00,712,  The sony waterproof case is only (starting from 200$ too 800$) ... the actual camera cost less  http://www.leisurepro.com/prod/IK621015.ht...e=18-53772966-2 http://www.leisurepro.com/prod/IK603851.ht...e=18-53773015-2
438055,scugpg,2010-02-28 13:01:00,1373," That's a very good point about the D10's size. Wearing waders etc it'd be nice to slip in in the chest pocket. This is where the Z33 or Olympus has the advantage.  Mostly Digital here in London has the D10 around $325...I'm going to check the Olympus and Canon out today to see if the D10 would be manageable to carry. My guess if I dug around you could find the D10 under $300.  I'm not a huge photo buff, just want something that will work, give good photos and I don't mind the additional features.  Given I'm still rocking a Canon A510 3.2MP anything will be a huge upgrade   The fact that the new cameras have much better video is exciting to me as well.
