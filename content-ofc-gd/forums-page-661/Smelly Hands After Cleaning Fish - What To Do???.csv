482279,Twocoda,2010-07-04 17:52:00,4130, oh you have no idea how hard it is to reframe from myself!!!!!!!!!!!!  kinda interesting though ...toothpaste is a alkaline base product and lemon/orange/vinager are acids...
482300,Leecher,2010-07-04 19:12:00,7832, Give it a try.... works great
482310,BillM,2010-07-04 19:32:00,17367,"I still don't understand why you guys don't wear gloves, allergic or not there is no stink on my hands when I'm done cleaning fish, lol."
482312,Leecher,2010-07-04 19:34:00,7832, I don't know Bill.... it's a man thing I guess LOL
481549,Leecher,2010-07-02 01:44:00,7832,"For those that clean fish and wonder how to get the smell off your hands.... god knows it takes a few days for the smell to go away.... here's a quick way.....  after rising your hands thoroughly with water, apply a generous amount of tooth paste, rub it in and rinse it off with water and voila..... no more smell Leechman"
481557,corvette1,2010-07-02 02:05:00,1765,thanks leech next time i will give it a try

481582,pikeguy,2010-07-02 03:19:00,195,that sounds beater than my way. i use vinegar and if you have a cut or deep scratch you find out fast Thanks will try that next time
481589,Leecher,2010-07-02 03:37:00,7832,It's a very cheap but effective way to eliminate fish odor... This afternoon had to clean 3 trouts and gave it a good rub and no smell.... simply amazing Leechman
481591,BillM,2010-07-02 03:42:00,17367,I'm allergic to fish and use surgical gloves anytime I need to fillet a fish...  
481592,wallyboss,2010-07-02 03:44:00,1095,Or some lemon juice
481594,Leecher,2010-07-02 03:46:00,7832, What's your point???  I'm not allergic to fish and don't weir gloves     Joke / Joke  I hear you Bill but this tip is for the none allergic
481595,Leecher,2010-07-02 03:48:00,7832, Hey Dan... this is better than lemon juice    Try it next time
481597,wallyboss,2010-07-02 03:54:00,1095,"I will, I hate the smell of bass and musky on my hands after filleting."
481599,Leecher,2010-07-02 04:01:00,7832, :thumbsup_anim:
481640,Fish4Eyes,2010-07-02 12:50:00,1022,"Thanks for the tip. I used that heavy duty degreacer ""Mojo"" stuff yesterday and that didnt even take the smell off."
481643,ChrisK,2010-07-02 12:53:00,2772,Very funny
481652,Beans,2010-07-02 13:08:00,3339,Ketchup (Catsup) works good also!
481654,Grimace,2010-07-02 13:11:00,2020,Thanks for the tip.  I am going to give that a try.  I have always used lemon juice.
481676,pike n' whities,2010-07-02 16:13:00,131,the orange mechanic soap works wonders too! for me anyway...... I got lots of it layin around so I decided to use it the other day after cleaing my bass and pike.
481678,BITEME,2010-07-02 16:18:00,1968,WD-40
481683,Spiel,2010-07-02 16:30:00,9065,I wish I had to worry about such things.
481686,crappieperchhunter,2010-07-02 16:44:00,2582, That put a smile in my aisle  :thumbsup_anim:
481690,Leecher,2010-07-02 17:03:00,7832, Never tried it.... I'm sure it works just as good   I used lemon juice before and it works.... tooth paste leaves a nicer smell on your skin   Yeah that too!!!   That stuff works wonders.... good for fish attractant and smell repellent!!!   I wish I had too Chris.... but the better half does not like fish... period     So this is the solution for me
481759,Whitespinnerbait,2010-07-02 21:41:00,2038,Real men don't wash their hands after filleting  fish...
481765,Jewelbee,2010-07-02 22:21:00,422,"You guys are too funny, I wouldn't expect this topic to be so popular and I can't believe the obvious smart   comments haven't been made yet..LOL!!!!!"
481966,Leecher,2010-07-03 16:33:00,7832, Oh now.... don't tell me ya use gloves too     Sorry Bill didn't mean to..... but just couldn't resist   What did you expect??     It's tooth paste LOL
482245,Guest Johnny Bass,2010-07-04 16:52:00,0,Sounds good to me too. No more wiping towels with smelly fish hands.lol
