So a good beginner rod/reel that isn't very expensive would be awesome. So please let me know of a specific brand of rod and reel, a place to get it or if anyone is interested in selling one of theres!  Thanks so much!  "
482417,adempsey,2010-07-05 01:00:00,1498,Probably should mention what type of baits you're going to be throwing.   Those big honkin baits have different requirements.
482418,ChrisK,2010-07-05 01:10:00,2772,I think there was some talk awhile ago about a muskie version Ugly Stick that one of our members had acquired at a reasonable price. I thought it was a good pole for someone to start out with and get the feel of the hole muskie fishing thing.Heres the link to the pole. http://www.shakespeare-fishing.com/products/rods/ugly-tiger_2007.shtml
