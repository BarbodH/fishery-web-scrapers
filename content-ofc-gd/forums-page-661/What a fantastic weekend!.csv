482801,Bly,2010-07-06 03:16:00,1556,Wonderful Cliff!  Nice to read about good things happening to a great guy!   Hoping your next outing goes as well
482806,camillj,2010-07-06 03:25:00,1988,I am with Spiel on this one Cliff ... who needs gnarly old pickerels (even if they giggle atcha from your own dock) when you can get god's own beauties from a canoe in a secret creek ... what a great way to spend a day !
482846,corvette1,2010-07-06 12:01:00,1765,way to go cliff congrats
482866,lunkerbasshunter,2010-07-06 13:53:00,2585,50 bucks for a canoe is  steal! Great fish you got into there!  Cheers!
482273,Big Cliff,2010-07-04 17:40:00,6899,"Friday I helped a neighbour by fixing his lawn mower for him, we got talking and he told me he is selling his place and having a huge garage sale. He asked if I knew anyone looking for a canoe. Well as many of you know I was. It is exactly what I was looking for, nice and stable, not too heavy and all he wanted was $50.00. I walked over to his place and paddled it home.  Last night some friends were over for dinner and Jim asked if I would like to go trout fishing with him this morning. Had canoe, was willing to go (didn't take much arm twisting)  Jim picked me up (he has a truck) and away we went. It couldn't have been more beautiful, no one else around, the bugs weren't bad, and the fish were biting. We fished from about 8 until 12 and I caught 6 and missed a couple of more, here are the 4 I kept. (the board is 14"" long) "
482274,alexcba,2010-07-04 17:44:00,634,"gorgeous fish cliff! where did you get those bad boys?  fantastic weekend in deed. spent it on rice and hooked up with 2 monster musky, and atleast 2 dozen walleye."
482275,TC1OZ,2010-07-04 17:46:00,987,"Wow nice deal on the canoe, and even nicer fish!!!"
482277,DRIFTER_016,2010-07-04 17:50:00,10439,What no picture of the new ride?
482278,Big Cliff,2010-07-04 17:51:00,6899," It's a little stream about an hours drive North of here, sorry I can,t be more specific, this is only my second trip back in there but where we launch the canoes you wouldn't think there was much more than a ditch, as soon as you get around the first bend, it opens up into a beautiful stream and seems to go for miles.  Nice going on the walleye, what did you get them on?"
482280,alexcba,2010-07-04 17:58:00,634,"live target perch cranks 6-8 foot divers, and deep diving X raps at night.. first night off the dock in 6 casts i pulled in 4."
482297,Leecher,2010-07-04 19:06:00,7832,Awesome Cliff I'm sure you'll have a good lunch out those beauties Thanks for sharing Leechman
482298,splashhopper,2010-07-04 19:08:00,2931,great looking fish Cliff

482338,tjsa,2010-07-04 21:05:00,1578,"I haven't targeted small creek specks for quite some time now. Years in fact. Gotta go do that again. Usually just fried 'em up in butter or margarine, either way was fine with me, and always with the skin on.  Thanks for the post Cliff."
482341,Garry2Rs,2010-07-04 21:10:00,1425,Congratulations on the canoe and the nice trout too! Garry

482599,Spiel,2010-07-05 18:10:00,9065,"Very nice indeed Cliff, I'll take them Brookies over ole marble eyes any day."
482645,crappieperchhunter,2010-07-05 20:13:00,2582, True dat  Creek Specs are one of my fav's. Throw in some home fries and Maple baked beans and you got a fish dinner fit for a king.  And a new to you canoe Cliff. Sounds like a great deal and fishing trip to me. Enjoy your fish fry.
482650,fish-miester,2010-07-05 20:40:00,864,beauty cliff!

482767,wuchikubo,2010-07-06 01:30:00,1114,"Awesome deal on the canoe and fish, Cliff. Thanks for the post."
482772,Guest Johnny Bass,2010-07-06 01:36:00,0,LOL. I was expecting an amazing pickerel report. But a near free canoe and some awesome trout fishing sounds even better!
