482311,splashhopper,2010-07-04 19:32:00,2931,"Well this has been a slow start for the Large Mouths for me so far, but as my fishing mentor told me: "" if the line isn't in the water, you can't catch a fish"".  I took the canoe out again this am to my favorite local hole.  Decided to tilt the electric motor up and paddle in to the HEAVY SLOP.  Darn glad I did too.  The first cast with my top water frog( Scum frog with a big split shot up it's butt) and KERSPLASH!... was too excited and pulled the trigger too quick on it  Tossed a senko right back at at... but the slop was just too thick for me to work that thing in  Another 10 or fifteen minutes go by and I can hear fish rising all around me   .  It's just a matter of time I am thinking.  Yep, a few minutes later and I get a small one. ( too small for a pic.. hehe)  Couple more casts in the same general direction and get another small one.  Decide to paddle a little closer to shore with a big ol tree trunk coming ever so slightly out of the slop.  First cast.  BAM ... wait( one steam boat , two steam boat)  SET THE HOOK!   Yee haw... finally got a decent fish out of there this season.  Slugged my way a little further along the shore line and was rewarded with this one >>   Dang it was getting hot, so I headed for a shaded stretch where I could cast out from to the heavy mat.  A few minutes there and KERPOW !   By this time the heat was really getting to me and I had  some heavy paddling ahead ( in myfat bottom Sportspal  )   Once I got free from the mats  I put the motor in third gear and trolled on in with a beautiful breeze to cool me off.  Hope to get back out this week for some shore fishing. I think I found another way to get at the mats from shore too.  Happy fishing all.  Splashhopper"
