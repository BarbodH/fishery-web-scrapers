I bought a new boat and want to get rid of it quickly, but am not going to give it away. Just a general idea would be fine... The motor is an older model Merc, but it runs fine. All it needs is a water pump, which was ordered, and it will run fine. Everything works fine on the boat, but it could probably use some minor cosmetic work.  If pictures will give a better idea, then I can take a few pictures.  Thanks!"
