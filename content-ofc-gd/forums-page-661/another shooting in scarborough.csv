483057,jughead,2010-07-07 00:06:00,92,"  Meh, after 25 years of marriage I'm more comfortable on thin ice."
483059,kickingfrog,2010-07-07 00:09:00,8333,Sapose the shooter found out how much his haircuts costs now?
483062,danbouck,2010-07-07 00:14:00,4380," I actually burst out laughing, now my wife thinks I'm crazy!"
483074,HTHM,2010-07-07 00:51:00,4082,On a much more important note......                       HOLLAND WON!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
483077,Dara,2010-07-07 01:02:00,3052,"  Possibly the reason that the actual homicide rate is so low is because of gun control. They aren't used to having them and don't know how to shoot...lots of shootings, just not many kills"
482930,ecmilley,2010-07-06 17:43:00,2163,"yup cops just lockdown midland and midwest appears there was a shotting at the car wash, gonna be a great afternoon. think i should start looking for work closer to home this is the second major incident around here"
482933,ketchenany,2010-07-06 17:49:00,3229,  They probably forgot to wax it!
482934,alexcba,2010-07-06 17:51:00,634,"lol these things happen on such a daily basis around there i doubt they even report half of it anymore. i know in my area just down the road it gets pretty hairy aswell. i dont even bother walking in that direction. last time i did 3 guys tried to rob me, unfortunately for them it was infront of a friends house and there was some pain dealt."
482936,Headhunter,2010-07-06 18:00:00,5703,"Well there's a pretty significant ""lock down"" happening down town right now... they have closed University Ave for the Shriners parade, until 7:00pm tonight. Absolute grid lock down here... 1/2 an hour to go a block... luckily, it's not hot outside! Stay safe all... HH"
482969,Ben_Daniels,2010-07-06 19:49:00,435, Somethin about those old guys in funny hats and little cars makes me really happy
482988,siwash,2010-07-06 20:33:00,683,"  Actually they don't.. Toronto is still one of the safest cities in the world... between 50-70 homicides annually.. that is very low for a big city  And, as a matter of fact, Toronto is ranked 29th in crime in Canada.. so there are 28 cities with higher crimes rates (based on percentage of crimes per inhabitants).. this includes murder, attempted murder, aggrevated assaults, sexual assaults, break n enter, etc...  in fact the crime rate in toronto ha been declining steadily since the late 80's. I have done a lot of research in this area, so I know my crap..  Look it up if you don't believe me  It's the media that needs to sell news that hypes this stuff.. plus it's a big city - stuff happens"
483000,pikeguy,2010-07-06 21:05:00,195, I think would invest in a bullet proof vest if i worked around there. lol And maybe get a tank to drive to work let see them car jack that. lol Sorry to make humor about this but i live in sudbury and the biggest thing that happen most recent around here is some kids that spray painted the bus stops  But i do feel for you be safe
483004,perchslayer666,2010-07-06 21:19:00,280,Typical fo' dis hood. Where else can you find great jerk chicken?
483006,Billy Bob,2010-07-06 21:26:00,5865,Outlaw guns and then only criminals will have guns...so how's that working for you.....
483007,perchslayer666,2010-07-06 21:36:00,280," My American friend, you should be the last guy on here to chime in with regards to gun control. Some places in the USA make the violence in Scarborough look like a game of bloody knuckles. (Not to down play the people that got shot today) We can thank USA for our gun problem, that is a fact."
483009,Roy,2010-07-06 21:42:00,13728," Chancho, don't even go there."
483010,Billy Bob,2010-07-06 21:43:00,5865," However, the fact is the area where we have the MOST gun control like NYC or LA we have the most crime....in areas where you can own a hand gun we have the least crime....GO FIGURE...."
483011,danbouck,2010-07-06 21:47:00,4380,This is going downhill fast!
483012,Roy,2010-07-06 21:50:00,13728,Yes it is Dan and I'm watching it with my three lil' eyes.
483013,JohnF,2010-07-06 21:57:00,3494," Is this a test, Roy?  JF"
483015,jughead,2010-07-06 22:02:00,92,"The thing is Roy, he did go there and rather than sugar coating it why not just say the board doesn't tolerate racists."
483016,alexcba,2010-07-06 22:04:00,634,oh boy..
483021,bigfish1965,2010-07-06 22:25:00,3382,"Two fingers on the trigger now, Roy....so to speak.   There is conflicting anecdotal evidence for both sides of the handgun control law. However, we have it and we are used to it. Toronto, considering its size, is still one of the safest cities in the world."
483024,perchslayer666,2010-07-06 22:31:00,280,  I am no racist brah believe you me. Funny how the fishergirls on this board get their panties in a knot because something is taken out of context.  Lock this thread up now oh great bearded one.
483029,JohnF,2010-07-06 22:37:00,3494, I think you just failed the test.  JF
483031,danbouck,2010-07-06 22:41:00,4380,So I went fishing today...
483032,ctranter,2010-07-06 22:49:00,543,"I think its sad that crime in Toronto is spreading to the outter regions of the GTA... Scarberia, Mississauga, Brampton, rather than being restricted to the ""ghetto's"" or urban centers, where it can be more contained by police."
483036,DRIFTER_016,2010-07-06 22:59:00,10439,  OMG!!!!! It's Blinky the Three Eyed Moderator!!!!!  
483045,jughead,2010-07-06 23:31:00,92, Then you should probably not type racist comments to avoid the confusion.
483047,Twocoda,2010-07-06 23:41:00,4130,wow 41 degrees out and i hear thin ice cracking ...
