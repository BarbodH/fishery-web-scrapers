482945,TC1OZ,2010-07-06 18:58:00,987,Just wanted to point out the Canadian Tire Gas in Fort Erie has now closed the full service due to HST. I'm sure all those kids who worked at the gas station pumping gas are loving the HST!  
482949,BillM,2010-07-06 19:06:00,17367,The HST is a horrible excuse.  I would guess the real reason is that people don't wanna pay an extra $0.XX per litre for some kid to spill gas all over their car...
482951,Fish4Eyes,2010-07-06 19:09:00,1022, Thats nothing. I know guys who have a smoke hanging out their mouth and pump other peoples gas
