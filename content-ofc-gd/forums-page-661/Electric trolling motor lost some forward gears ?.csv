( the wire in to the clip)  Last night the motor was side mounted on my canoe and I used it for the first time since re-attaching the wire.  To my surprise I now only have two forward gears,4th and fifth. ( used to have five) I still have the two speeds for reverse though.  Those are the fastest gears and really move the canoe along way too fast for closing in on trees and points etc.  Has anyone else had this happen out of the blue?  And what did you do to fix it?  Thanks  Splashhopper"

I ask this because today I realized that, last night, I was turning the throttle the opposite way of what I usually do to make it go forward and reverse?"

482355,splashhopper,2010-07-04 22:05:00,2931, Red-necks like me like our motors dumb too
482365,Terry,2010-07-04 22:31:00,14456,don't say that  I have done it a few times myself
