I decided to record a bit of the show so the kids can watch it again.  Fireworks Part 1  Fireworks Part 2  Friday morning I went over to visit John from the board. I bought a stove from him for a price that I couldn't turn down. The thing is amazing, I'm not used to having anything remotely high end so this is a nice change.    Friday night Jacob wanted to sleep outside in the tent trailer so we went out with Chevy and watched the movie Cars until we fell asleep    I think Chevy was the only one that stayed awake for the whole movie lol    Saturday we went down to the cottage for the night. Below is some pics from my WFN blog  A few hours after arriving on Saturday I was able to get out in the boat with my oldest son Jacob and my Step Father Doug. The wind was brutal and the top on the boat acted like a sail so we decided to troll for a bit.    Jacob kept himself amused playing with his water gun, the livewell comes in handy for refilling!    We were only out for about an hour an a half and didn't get a hit. It didn't matter to me though, it was just a relaxing time on the water (and in the water when we went swimming)!          On the way back in, Jacob managed to fall asleep in the front seat and not even budge going over the waves. Doug thought he had a seatbelt on lol!  Saturday evening my wife Sam, my youngest Jamie and I went out for a cruise around the lake. He has never been that great in the boat but is starting to get the hang of it.      This is one of my favourite pics of the weekend!    On the way back Jamie wanted to drive.      Sunday morning I went out my myself for a few hours drifting minnows. I didn't catch a single thing. The day was cut short when I had to help fix a drain at the cottage. Hopefully next weekend's report will have some fish in the report.  and this pic just so I don't have to say NF  "

482781,Guest Johnny Bass,2010-07-06 02:01:00,0,Great report and time well spent with the family. That is some very freaky fireworks. It must be new stuff or just the way the camera captures it.
