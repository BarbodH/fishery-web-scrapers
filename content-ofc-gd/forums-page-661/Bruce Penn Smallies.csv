Was able to get out on the water fairly early    Didn't take long to get into the 1st smallie. Most were caught on a purple Zoom lizard at the edge of the weeds.    Caught two more in 15-20 mins in the same area. Little guy lost about 3 more but he said he was having fun spite not getting them in the boat.   The bite slowed a bit so we moved out into the lake into a deeper hole (10' under the boat is deep for this lake)   This one grabbed a brown jig bounced on the bottom.   Caught one more out deeper on a black twister. It hit the jig when it hit the water. Good show! Little guy lost a couple more. Working on setting the hock a bit better.   The bite slowed again so we moved back to the weeds and caught a couple smaller ones, but still a good size.     We did pretty good for fishing about 4 hours. Wish I got a couple shot with my son fighting fish, but he lost them before I got the camera out. But he did pretty good taking pictures for me."
