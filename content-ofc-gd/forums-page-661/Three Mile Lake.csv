I am just wondering what type of fish exist in the lake and am looking for any tips/suggestions if possible. If anybody has ever been there before any sort of feedback would be greatly appreciated.  Thanks everyone!"
482047,Michael_Brown,2010-07-04 00:12:00,411," Three Mile lake has Largemouth and smallmouth bass, walleye, perch, sunfish, rockbass and cisco's. It is a good lake for fishing. For bass and walleye I used to fish the around the trailer park and in Green bay. There is a boat launch near the trailer park. Most fish will be related to some of the weed cover. If your staying over, a rapala at dark cast over the sand or rock points will usually count for some decent wallaye. I have caught walleye up to 8lbs in Three Mile. The Muskoka Bassmasters club have held tournaments there in the past with goods weights of bass. They would be a good source of info.  Good luck."
