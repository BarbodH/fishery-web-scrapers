482620,dannyboy,2010-07-05 19:25:00,367,"Had a fantastic day on the water Sunday with Lloyd (fishhunter on OFC)  On the water by 5 am, it didn't take long for the first hookup  and from there on the fishing was awesome.   Lloyd kept us catching fish steady all day and the class of fish was fantastic. The highlight of our day was our kids catching fish, Mark wasn't so keen at first but enjoyed himself, one salmon peeled off close to 200 feet of line and took several other runs but his arms held out.  The smile tells all.  Marie loves to fish and really enjoyed herself, dad lent a hand, not that she needed the help  and Lloyd showed her how to hold the fish  Once she got the hang of things there was no looking back   (Mom caught fish too but is camera shy) Our day on the water seemed to end too soon, Lloyd was clearing up and had explained to us that he always fished to the end, sure enough as he was getting ready to bring in the last rods we had a hit and this rainbow must have been half tarpon as it seemed to spend more time out of the water than in it,   Lloyd is top of the line guide and you can tell he has his clients best interests in mind, from safety and comfort to working at getting us on fish, to his knowledge of the water and the fish. You can tell a professional by how easy they make their job look.  The boat is comfortable, clean and well maintained and equipment is in great shape, I don't know how many 100s of spoons and other lures he has but they sure did the trick.   Lloyd cleaned and packaged the chinooks, coho and rainbows we kept, some destined for the smoker tonight.   We had a fantastic day on the water and want to thank Lloyd for making it possible.  Dan"
