481497,misfish,2010-07-01 22:17:00,29133,Yer a couple of weeks late bud.  Cant get over the lady screaming.
481499,bullybass,2010-07-01 22:20:00,144,I love how people will continue to film instead of going out there and saving the dog!!! idiots!!
481504,misfish,2010-07-01 22:33:00,29133," Ever seen what a deer can do to a human? That doe was attacking to protect her young. One swipe of a hoof from her,would slice you open.  I do understand what yer saying though."
481506,Dave Bailey,2010-07-01 22:39:00,1641,"A mother protecting her young, nothing disturbing about that. At least that cat had the sense to high-tail it out of the area."
481508,Whitespinnerbait,2010-07-01 23:04:00,2038,  Its just the deer paying back the dog for all the times .....People let their Dogs run a deer to death !!!  idiots !!!!!
481509,BillM,2010-07-01 23:10:00,17367,"Good job at letting the dog out lady, if you wanna blame anyone blame yourself.  And people think deer are harmless, lol."
481511,thalweg,2010-07-01 23:10:00,112,Mother nature's natural programming for the deer.  The dog was at the wrong place at the wrong time.  I Didn't interpret the dog posing a threat but Deer may have took it for a coyote.  I'm a dog lover..but I don't blame the deer.
481526,Radnine,2010-07-01 23:56:00,1538,Isn't this why hunters use tree stands? Jim
481603,jediangler,2010-07-02 04:30:00,1923,Why wasn't the dog on a leash? I'm not a cat person but that cat had some cahones taking a swipe at the doe.
481605,Twocoda,2010-07-02 04:49:00,4130,unfortunately i know from experience on how those hooves feel hitting you from the doe ....the little fawn looks sooooooo cute and innocent but its hooves are almost razor sharp and i had one penetrate through my jeans (on my thigh) and start thrashing around whilst stuck in my jeans removing most of my pants from my body....luckily i only received shallow cuts to the thigh......oh the stories i can tell from the farming days....  the dog will be fine ...although it looks bad im sure the dog was fine (maybe not his ego) ...most of the plunges grazed him or missed....my aussie at the time took a few good licks from Elk and  NZ Reds until he learned to read the deer better and learned to change direction in mid air/flight
481607,BillsTheBassMan,2010-07-02 04:56:00,932,That cat had a lot of moxy . . . threw the first punch and got out while the getting was good!
481681,misfish,2010-07-02 16:25:00,29133, Thanks for the chuckle Jim.   This is why they tell you to reach and poke your downed harvest.Safe distance from the rear legs.
481712,Rattletrap2,2010-07-02 18:24:00,1652,I saw that on television yesterday or the day before. They said the dog was only bruised. I can't figure out why She let the cat off so easy! The dog didn't go anywhere near her fawn.
481714,bullybass,2010-07-02 18:30:00,144,"I think in the very least I would have come out and tried to distract the doe from beating up my dog. My beautiful hunting dog   would have faired the same, I fear, as he is even afraid of rain... hahaha. I certainly would not want to be kicked by one of those hooves but I love my Gdamned dog and instinct would be to protect him.  I like the beginning with the cat tasting the fawn... super ballsy cat!!!"
481719,bare foot wader,2010-07-02 18:43:00,1354,"that cat was awesome, my cat would've done the same...lol  too many people just let their dogs run deer in the bush....looks to me like that doe got some payback"
481766,cpguy29,2010-07-02 22:25:00,148,That dog got owned!
481776,Jewelbee,2010-07-02 22:47:00,422,Poor dog! Dumb owner! Never underestimate the instincts of a wild animal with a baby!
482400,ohhenrygsr,2010-07-04 23:31:00,947,
482610,siwash,2010-07-05 18:49:00,683,Holy!! And you guys think a coyote has a chance against a deer??? No way.. I think the coyote predation on fawns is overblown after watching that.
482611,siwash,2010-07-05 18:51:00,683,oh i forgot to mention this:  BAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAA
482614,bare foot wader,2010-07-05 19:10:00,1354," well a coyote is a wee bit more of a challenge/smarter than a domesticated mutt that was obviously just curious and not looking for a meal....yotes work in a pack, see it all the time, one of the smaller ones yipping at our pup and trying to draw him into the bush where the rest are waiting"
482825,pikehunter,2010-07-06 07:08:00,1659,That is one adventurous smartass cat and one   dog.
482832,dave524,2010-07-06 10:55:00,4508," Lone coyote yes, but usually there is more than 1, entirely different story then. One draws mama off and the rest make the kill."
483054,lunkerbasshunter,2010-07-07 00:03:00,2585,"wow that poor pouch, if that was my dog i think i would have taking the charge and shot the thing.  glad there were no kids around!"
