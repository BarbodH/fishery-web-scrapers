482666,tb4me,2010-07-05 21:19:00,3295,I bought a power drive V2 about 5 weeks ago. Maybe have 4 hrs use on it. I went down to the dock yesterday to find the motor had turned on itw own untill the cord wrapped around the shaft and couldnt turn anymore.I would appear as the motor is completely burned out?!  I always unplug the foot pedal when not in use but this time it was just for overnight so I didnt.I checked the fuse and replaced it and nadda.The battery gauge shows 3/4 of a charge. So I charged the battery for a few hours. Try the motor again and all it will do is hummm and the prop wont turn. Im not impressed with this has anyone else had issues with brand new minn kota motors? So I call customer support # right on the motor and thier answering machine says thier closed for the new years holiday season!   Does anyone here think i can just simply return it to Canadian tire or am i limited to just minnkota service folks? Man am I bummed
482668,Paully,2010-07-05 21:22:00,712,I'd go to crappy tire and tell them it didn't work right out of the box..Your only bending the truth a little.. get a new replacement.
482673,fish-miester,2010-07-05 21:33:00,864,my friends powerdrive didnt work right so they took it back and got the V2 as a replacement and love it ever since.. so your best bet is to take it back to CT just tell them its faulty
482688,tb4me,2010-07-05 22:07:00,3295,well i now have it uninstalled (totally pissed BTW) and im going to attempt to return it to crappy. I wonder (after reading the other minnkota motor post) if the foot pedal went for a you know what? But why so soon? Im now thinkin id like my cash back and go buy a cable steer. motor guide perhaps? ARGH
482699,fish-miester,2010-07-05 22:33:00,864,i personally wouldnt suggest a   M.G my friend had 1 and it was complete garbage.. he ended up buying the V2 and it was like night a day better
482831,Randy,2010-07-06 10:18:00,115,Minn Kota motors are owned by Johnson Outdoors. Johnson Outdoors has an office in Burlington. You may want to give them a call.  A few years ago I had a problem with my Cannon speed and temp that Johnson Outdoors also owns. I returned it to Minnesota before I found out about the Burlington office.
482838,Billy Bob,2010-07-06 11:28:00,5865,Return it and get yourself a cable steer Minn Kota Unit...there is a reason the pros use cable steer units. They need something that's not going to crap out on them in a tournament. Power drive units have a long history of problems with the foot control.  Bob
482929,ohhenrygsr,2010-07-06 17:43:00,947," Hopefully you still have your receipt.  Return it to Canadian Tire and get another one.  Minn Kota or Motorguide are both good names.  Keep in mind that these things are made by man.  So there are bound to be a couple that are bad.  If Canadian Tire doesn't help you bring your unit with receipt as proof of purchase to  A Aikman Sporting Goods Repair 3010 Novar Rd Mississauga, ONL5B 1S4 Phone: 905-277-3595 Fax: 905-277-0088   They are an authorized warranty for Minn Kota."
482946,jimmer,2010-07-06 19:03:00,2730,"Bring it back to CT and tell them it doesn't work.  They should give you a new one.  Stick with Minn Kota, it would be a mistake to go to MG."
483001,aplumma,2010-07-06 21:10:00,6896,Keep the faith I am sure Minn Kota will do the right thing. They did me right when my speed controller went bad a few years ago.   Art
483069,wallyboss,2010-07-07 00:37:00,1095,It happened to me when I forgot to turn off my Auto-pilot and I stowed the motor away. It kept turning around until I pulled the plug or turned off the Auto-pilot. Hopefully you didn't make the same error.
