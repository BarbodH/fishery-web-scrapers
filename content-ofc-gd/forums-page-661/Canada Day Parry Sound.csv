482158,TC1OZ,2010-07-04 11:06:00,987,"I was up at my cottage in Parry Sound for 2 days of lack luster fishing. It was my first time at the cottage without using live bait. I'm starting to think it was a mistake, but then again the weather wasn't the greatest. Despite the lack of fish and my stories of the cottage turning out to be just that stories...I was able to pass on the fishing bug to two of my best friends who had ZERO interest in fishing before the cottage. To save myself the hassle I advised both of them to buy fishing licenses so I didn't have any issues with the MNR... I mean since I saved them so much on a cottage trip. And my one buddy lost about 30$ worth of MY spinner baits.... At least two of them were in fishes mouths...  Most of our time was spent trolling the shores with spinner baits. I figured if I could get them into some decent sized large mouth I will have no issues finding a fishing partner in the future.  Sure enough I was able to find a few for them. (not myself)      Second one is slightly larger at 4.2 Lbs versus my cousins which was spot on 4 Lbs. Both caught on double willow tipped white spinner baits rigged with curly tail grubs.  So onto my fish porn   :    I was impressed that tiny pike was able to get his mouth around the hook... and he actually put up a fight, I thought it was a bass at first.    Pretty standard size for my cottages bay, caught several of these on spinner baits. I also landed two my first ever time jigging with those gulp alive minnows and an unpainted jig head! Very cool fight!  Most of my other fish just went right in the water with no pictures as I was spending the entire time trying to top my friends fish...with no such luck.  The most important part of the trip was spending time with family and friends. And nothings better than passing on the addiction of fishing to a good friend!  Tight lines everyone; hope you had a happy Canada Day!    Thanks for reading!"

482166,Terry,2010-07-04 11:24:00,14456,"looks like a good time to me even if your ""friend"" doesn't buy you some new spinner baits"
482167,TC1OZ,2010-07-04 11:26:00,987," Thanks for the read Roy!  And your right it was on and off all day for the weather. And the night before was torrential for rain, I was up listening to the rain debating on weather or not to beach the little john boat I had at the dock."
482169,TC1OZ,2010-07-04 11:30:00,987," hahaha, my buddy Eugene didn't even make the pictures as he couldn't land a fish! You'd think being from north bay he would know how to fish, but I guess I re-ignited his passion from when he was a little kid for fishing. He can't wait to be invited back to the cottage (really soon) for some more fishing. When I took him back to the marina he insisted on taking me into town to buy me some gear! But it was a good time and I told him next time to bring his own"

482454,TC1OZ,2010-07-05 03:12:00,987, I have an awesome fishing buddy @ work... but we work a rotation schedule and of course our shifts are opposite! Thankfully my cousins fish up at the cottage and now a couple of my friends are getting the bug!  Thanks for the read slash!
482778,Guest Johnny Bass,2010-07-06 01:57:00,0,Great report. Looks like very mouth watering water. If you think losing $30 dollars of lures is bad? Try bringing some girls out fishing!lol
