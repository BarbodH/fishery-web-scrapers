482657,bare foot wader,2010-07-05 20:54:00,1354," no way, good non stoppage....look at the guy, he has the ability to take more than a few heavy hits, he weathered the storm and let carwin gas himself out..."
482661,SBCregal,2010-07-05 20:57:00,688,"I agree with Steve 100%... it was a great event, best in a while."
482663,Terry,2010-07-05 21:08:00,14456,"yup I agree it was a good call but there are some refs that would have ended the fight... and there were some great fights in ufc 116, well worth the price"
482670,fish-miester,2010-07-05 21:24:00,864,I would of preffered Carwin to win just cause im not a fan of Lesnar..tho he is killer quick for such a big guy!.. but oh well. well just have to see if a re-match come up in the future. maybe carwin can get in shape
482745,Twocoda,2010-07-06 00:44:00,4130," and for that reason is why the fight wasnt stopped....Lesner possibly has a chance against Fedor ....where as Carwin...more then likely doesnt.....Its a genius marketing maneuver from Dana to lure Fedor into the UFC...Fedor wants to be the TRUE WORLD Champion (hence why he only fights internationally)...but that will more then likely mean ....at least now someone from the USA can represent but i think it will mean for Lesner to fight unsanctioned from the UFC....in order to meet up with Fedor  Then this winner will be the ""WORLD CHAMPION"" on a world stage (not just the USA/UFC and its rules)  Regardless of how or when ....i just hope it does happen before one of them is too old or seriously injured....it will be the biggest fight in the history of all fights IMO  But Fedor gets the win....Lesner still has ALOT to learn in and out of the ring..oh and he shoots his toilet off too much"
482119,Twocoda,2010-07-04 03:48:00,4130,
482121,SBCregal,2010-07-04 04:01:00,688,heeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeere we go
482122,danc,2010-07-04 04:19:00,4677,Glad I didn't pay for that.
482124,Twocoda,2010-07-04 04:25:00,4130,Well ya have to give Lesner the solid face award anyways....Carwins cardio killed him...
482125,misfish,2010-07-04 04:28:00,29133," Glad I did. He took it,and gave it right back (had me worried, but he covered up good). Lesner is a monster.  Ok 8 to go,got to go."
482126,Gerritt,2010-07-04 04:31:00,6129,Nice to see Lesner weather the storm... given the size of his biceps I am surprised he did not tap sooner.  I had my money on Lesner and he came through... It was a quick fight.  I finally found a working feed... seems they are cracking down on them.. (as they should I suppose)  anyways I hope everyone enjoyed tonight's card.  G
482127,SBCregal,2010-07-04 04:32:00,688,"that event was WELL worth the price of the PPV. lots of real good battles all night.  and in reality, the ppv at home is much cheaper than my tab at the bar would be"
482129,[emailÂ protected],2010-07-04 04:41:00,119,"what the hell just happened???????  How did Lesnar survive that onslaught?? I'm no fan of his, but kudos to Lesnar for hanging in there and ending it.  If Lesnar can add the ability to submit to his arsenal.....woah!!!  fight of the night  --- Leben vs Akiyama"
482133,BillM,2010-07-04 04:56:00,17367,"Any other fight would have been called, Lesnar basically lied there half the round being pounded..  Carwin needs to do a bit more cardio the next time around and pick his shots.  If he did both, it would have turned out differently."
482161,Terry,2010-07-04 11:17:00,14456,if Lesnar ever learns not to turtle when being hit..cause he can sure take a punch and just take the hit and counter he would be unstoppable .......maybe he already is
482202,BillM,2010-07-04 14:34:00,17367, I'd like to see him and Fedor.
482239,Twocoda,2010-07-04 16:45:00,4130, Lesner isnt even in the same realm as Fedor....Fedor would impose his will on Lesner and make him cry like a school girl that just discovered she has a monthly friend....  Yeah im a bit miffed that Lesner won ....but im glad Carwin messed the big luggs face up anyways...just wish he hadnt run out of gas....  Lesner is too big for his britches ....
482244,ehg,2010-07-04 16:51:00,2666,Thought for sure Carwin was going to win after that first round barrage. Incredible that Lesnar survived and won. WOW!  Started watching when Stephen Bonnar won a great fight. The fights were all good after that.
482250,SBCregal,2010-07-04 16:59:00,688,"lesnar is a freak of nature.  its understandable why people dont like him but cmon, you gotta respect what hes been able to do.  for a man his size, the speed that he moves with is incredible.  carwin has punching power, but as seen last night, he doesnt have what it takes to deal with someone with a chin solid enough to absorb it.  *I* wouldnt be that impressed with title defense fights that last less than 2 minutes.  you gotta be more rounded to continue to win fights.  lesnar DESERVED that win... better all around."
482257,skankbutta,2010-07-04 17:07:00,32,"Fight should have been called. They called one earlier in the card that wasn't even as bad as that.... Carwin got robbed. When Brock got up, I knew it was over. Carwin was gassed and Lesnar looked normal."
482263,Gerritt,2010-07-04 17:16:00,6129,"  Did you watch the post match interviews/press conference? Carwin was taken to hospital after fighting Brock.. Speaks volumes on the power Brock possesses. He was very casual, articulate and coy when being interviewed.  Brock deserved the win, after sustaining the first round onslaught that Carwin imposed on him.  G"
482267,Twocoda,2010-07-04 17:21:00,4130,no i didnt see it G but ill look for it now ...  Yes the better man won that fight ...but it doesnt mean i have to like it ...
482271,BillM,2010-07-04 17:29:00,17367," No way, calling that fight would have sucked.  After all those blows Lesnar was relatively unscathed..  I wanted Carwin to win also, but do it fair and sqaure..  Carwin gassed and couldn't take advantage of the situation."
482287,Terry,2010-07-04 18:14:00,14456,"[media][/media] http://veetle.com/in...w#4bf81bc3b2ad2  ufc 116 is being replayed right now on veetle..if you missed it <script type=""text/javascript"" src=""http://veetle.com/widget/script.js""></script><div veetleChannelId=""CD1C693F4F71EAFE358F86DB4205956C"" autoPlay=""false"" style=""width: 480px; height: 352px"" aspectRatio=""default""></div>"
482426,Dan668,2010-07-05 01:27:00,1120,"due to brocks size and his wrestling skills, i dont think anyone currently in the ufc has a chance. Cain, the guy will get taken down right away."
482432,Terry,2010-07-05 01:47:00,14456,well in all fairness  a different ref could have easily stopped the fight while Lesnar was turtled and being witch slapped ......
482458,bucktail,2010-07-05 03:29:00,1857,"I wondered afterward if Brock hadnt been Dana Whites poster boy if the fight would have been stopped. Seen many UFC fights were if the guy on the bottom doesnt try to throw back it is called. Give Lesner credit for hanging in there! All in all Lesner is still only one well timed knee when he shoots from being out cold, can only play the same game so long before your caught."
482462,Cudz,2010-07-05 03:37:00,2652,It did not deserve to be stopped.  Everytime the ref asked Brock to defend himself he did and he moved as well. Great non-stopage. Carwin put all his eggs in one basket and couldn't finish the job.  I like Carwin and he had a great takedown defense in the 1st round but now he needs to go back and work on the cardio.  Lesnar looked sharp in the 2nd and dominated.  He passed guard so quickly for a big guy and I have probably never seen anyone ever leave a full mount on purpose.  Turns out it was the right move. Slick indeed.
482627,Dan668,2010-07-05 19:37:00,1120,"the ref did a great job in not stopping, brock covered up good."
482643,steverowbotham,2010-07-05 20:12:00,1800,"Josh Rosenthal reffed that fight and did a great job!  Earlier in the thread someone said, I'm glad I didnt pay for that... that was on of the best UFC PPV's in a long time, every fight was a great fight, well worth the price if you're an MMA fan, well worth it. P.S. As much as I hate the dude, Lesnar would destroy Fedor IMO."
481919,ehg,2010-07-03 14:08:00,2666,"Not sure who would win this, but thinking Carwin. Lesnar is slightly favoured. Who Knows?"
481923,bassman87,2010-07-03 14:31:00,586,"i wish i was in vegas for this card instead of the rampage and rashad card. brock hypes up fights pretty good and is quite entertaining, i hope he continues to be champ"
481924,bassman87,2010-07-03 14:32:00,586,and the dude loves hunting and fishing
481930,chessy,2010-07-03 14:48:00,610,if it says up carwin should win if goes to ground lesnor
481947,Toddyc20,2010-07-03 15:43:00,141,I hope Carwin takes it just because I like his attitude.  He isn't cocky like Lesnar is.  I hope it goes a few rounds though just because I want to watch a good long fight and not one that is over in the first round again.
481948,Terry,2010-07-03 15:46:00,14456,"If Lesnar has been learning while out of the ring so long, I think he will win easy  but if he has not been learning and practicing, he's dead meat"
481964,ld17,2010-07-03 16:31:00,319,lesnar first round TKO.  You heard it hear first!
481973,Governator,2010-07-03 17:14:00,879,"Carwin is 12-0 all finished in the first round and he's kept his job as an engineer.  A fighter with class and brains, he'd be a much better champion imo.  Carwin in first round, although it's always exciting to see what Brock has in store.  Should be an outstanding win for either.  I just hope this fight doesn't make it to the judges."
481974,ld17,2010-07-03 17:20:00,319,If the fight stays standing carwin may have a chance.  Brock is to good to let that happen.  Look for the takedown and ground and pound. Again lesnar first round.  Don't blink you may miss this one.
481990,steverowbotham,2010-07-03 19:04:00,1800,"This fight really could go either way.  I want Carwin to win, and wont be surprised if he does, but I still see Lesnar winning by TKO in Rd 2"
482004,Dan668,2010-07-03 20:31:00,1120,lesnar tko
482007,lunkerbasshunter,2010-07-03 21:18:00,2585,"if lesner doesnt take it to the ground he is in trouble.  but he isnt that dumb,  the rust may be an issue for lesnar though and lets face it this carwin guy can toss bombs!  should be a great fight"
482008,Gerritt,2010-07-03 21:23:00,6129,what sites is everyone watching it online?... so we all have a backup plan...  I will be trying veetle.
482014,Twocoda,2010-07-03 22:13:00,4130,last fights veetle didnt brodcast ...so i watched it on tenchistv...im sure ill be using one or the other tonight .....
482016,Gerritt,2010-07-03 22:17:00,6129,I was able to watch it on Veetle.. but I will check out this other broadcaster too!
482024,misfish,2010-07-03 22:45:00,29133,"Lesner in the 2nd.Will be interesting to see if he can take a punch from Carwin. His comment that he,s never been hit because the other fighter never had a chance,make me wonder.We all know Carwin can throw them size 6 hamhocks.Lesner is a size 5.  I payed for this event.HD and fullwide screen here."
482027,Terry,2010-07-03 23:04:00,14456,I have it on tv too
482028,misfish,2010-07-03 23:12:00,29133,"BUT,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Did you,,,,,,,,,,"
482030,Terry,2010-07-03 23:22:00,14456, did I whistle ??...   ..........fight club .......rule number one ..........We don't talk about fight club........
482039,misfish,2010-07-03 23:52:00,29133,"  Enjoy the fight bud.Talk,,,,,,,fish soon."
482057,Moosebunk,2010-07-04 00:29:00,3970,"I wish the rest of the card had a little more meat to it.  We'll be paying for it here, but it will suck if it's a quick fight.  I hope the two go 5 full rounds on their feet and just bloody one another to a pulp before Carwin takes his head off at 1 second left in the 5th."
482059,danc,2010-07-04 00:32:00,4677,  LOL   I'm gonna have to go with Mr. Lesnar.
482063,Moosebunk,2010-07-04 00:41:00,3970, Wouldn't hurt my feelings either.  I enjoy watching both these heavy weights fight.
482075,SBCregal,2010-07-04 01:16:00,688,prelims are on SportsnetHD    on cogeco its 731...not a bad fight so far   ryan    woah...fight ends as im typing.
482115,ehg,2010-07-04 03:26:00,2666,Looking forward to the big fights. Hopefully Carwin wins but whoever wins definitely will deserve the title.
