482232,10point,2010-07-04 16:28:00,165,Just got back from a week of fishing the south part of Temagami. Stayed at Tamar. Weather was awful and the bite was tough. Our best day was our first day when we caught 30 smallies. We made one trip into Cross Lake and trolled up a pike which my son was very proud of and one walleye. I wish we could have fished cross more but it was a long way and we did bust a prop up coming out of there. Luckily we had an extra one. Besides 3 walleyes and 1 pike all of our fish were smallies.

At least you caught a few fish and you enjoyed some time away from the city. One thing about smallies. Even the small ones put up a good fight!Thanks for sharing."
