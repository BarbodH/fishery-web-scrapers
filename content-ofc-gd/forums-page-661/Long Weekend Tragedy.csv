482378,Dutch,2010-07-04 22:49:00,831,"Police searching for boy who fell from boat Posted By FIONA ISAACSON, Examiner Staff Writer Posted 1 hour ago   CAMPBELLFORD â€“ Northumberland OPP are looking for a missing 13-year-old boy after he fell out of a boat on the Trent River, south of Campbellford, on Saturday night.  The boy was a passenger when he fell out of the boat in rough water conditions, police say. He was not wearing a life jacket.  Police are currently searching for the boy on the river about 1.5 kilometres south of Campbellford.   Police divers are on scene.  --------------------------------------------  I hate to be the driver of that boat - rough waters and no life jacket on a 13 year old doesn't add up to be something positive.  Will people ever learn that if they aren't being worn, they won't ever save a life?  Shameful and completely preventable.  I hope for the best, but expect the worst."
