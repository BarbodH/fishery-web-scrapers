On the back of the gauge there are 4 terminals:  I - For the ignition  G - Ground (Obviously)  Light  S - ??  Does anyone know what the S is for??  Looking at my tach, there is an ""S"" as well, but I do not want to risk any damage, as the gauge works great with just the ignition, ground and light hooked up.  Any advise would be greatly appreciated!!"
