482392,Joey,2010-07-04 23:20:00,9122,"We decided to give Lake Ontario another go today.  We were expecting to boil out there, but with the nice wind, we kept relatively cool all day.  We ended up going 8 for 10.  Couple of shakers, couple of nice ones and a monster right at the end.  Paul had reeled in three  lines while I was slowly motoring back to harbour and the last line was still out and Wham, zzzzzzzzzzzzzzziiiiiiiiinnnnnnnggggggg, tore off 150 feet of line.  No horsing this fish and we netted her, measured, weighed and took a pic and back in she went, after a short revival.  Just a beauty Salmon!!!!!  Heading out of the harbour, there were small fish jumping in our prop wash, and the gulls and terns were there to pick them off.            Sweet Relief.......... get your minds out of the gutter    Gotta love an onboard wash down system           Not too much smog        Here she is, 40 inches, what a beaut!!!      Joey  p.s.  Thanks Spiel baby!!!"
