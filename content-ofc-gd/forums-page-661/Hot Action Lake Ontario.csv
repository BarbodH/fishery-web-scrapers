481772,Jewelbee,2010-07-02 22:34:00,422,"Awesome guys! Rick and I have a charter coming up soon ( as soon as we can plan time off together) I hope we have so much success, although we wouldn't be keeping all the catch, I say to each his own!!!"
481775,Roy,2010-07-02 22:42:00,13728,"Hey chessy, have you ever posted a fishing report? Just curious."
481796,chessy,2010-07-02 23:59:00,610,ROY  no i have not as you could have possibly seen by my post count.  I amnot saying i don’t like posted fishing reports but i have learned to keepinformation to myself. And could you clarify what this has to do with theslaughter of rainbow trout in lake Ontario or the limit of possibly 2 rainbowsin the lake just like the rivers here in Ontario. If you ask me any questions iwill sure to answer them truthfully. So what I should have done is started aseparate post about how SOME charter boats target rainbows to fill the boat orhow they say they are good to eat and are not. Yes you are correct i should nothave done that but unfortunately i did. If you being the administrator wish toremove my post and start another one I would not be offended at all over it. Thankyou for you time and consideration in regards to my posts. Oh and well we areon the subject how about the same guys on here not giving information out butcome on here to brag about their catches to promote there business No differentthem me complaining about them killing inedible fish  
481809,Roy,2010-07-03 00:11:00,13728,"I won't remove your post. You're doing quite well. My concern is that you're peeing on people for fishing in all legality. I'll repeat...if you don't like the present catch/possession limits, have them changed. Until such time as you do, leave the members of the community alone and let them post their reports."
481814,chessy,2010-07-03 00:32:00,610," SORRY Roy i dont mean to pee on any one what I am concerned about is people think it is just them catching fish this is happening all over lake o and they can times that by 100s the fishery can not support it .And like i said in my very first post they (mnr ) are looking at the ""cold water fishery ""  I think any one concerned about the fishing resourse could be concerned about such posted as it is happening daily.when boats bring in 20 rainbows a day day in day out something has to be said ."
481816,Roy,2010-07-03 00:42:00,13728,"Chessy, I didn't make it clear enough. Look up...see my post of 8:11pm? That's my last word."
481851,bigfish1965,2010-07-03 03:31:00,3382,"Let's see..I see tons of pics of the steelhead huggers pinning the fish before and after spawn on and around the redds...if you really gave a rats patootie you wouldn't fish them during the spawn, would you??? I don't fish walleye during or before spawn...I leave them be until they have recovered from the spawn. Steelheads are not native fish, neither are the salmon. Both are placed STRICTLY for alewife/smelt control and for sport fishing. The salmon are put and take, John, and you know it. The reproduction rate is not at all enough to sustain the population."
481861,danc,2010-07-03 04:13:00,4677," The answer is simple Rick. Make the lake fishing guys use fancy float reels and make them include that fancy reel in every photo. If in fact you can actually notice the fish instead of the fancy reel, then all is fair. Keep them or eat them. It's only the fancy reel that matters. Lord forbid if anyone caught a Steelhead on a Mitchell 300. How embarrassing would that be??"
481952,Fish Farmer,2010-07-03 15:57:00,2234,"How come you guys don't say anything about over harvested Sheephead, just thought I'd through that in. If you guys only new how many Big Rainbow and Salmon ended up in dumpsters when the Star derby ran years back when you got a ticket in the draw for every fish over 10 Lbs. It was a greedy slaughter. The fishery in Lake Ont. was a commercial fishery years ago when the Hamilton beach Strip was lined with nets. Then died. Then brought back for recreational fishing but then it was advised not to eat contaminated fish as they tell use today, but some people do including myself, take a chance. Then the big Boom hit the lake with the derby and the charter boat invasion which was big business. In a round about way it was a put and take fishery, whether people admit it or not. Now if they could only clean up the watershed and bring back natural reproduction but with the population booming it doesn't look good. So keeping your limit for the person that only fishes once in a while is not so bad. If they eat them, thats there choice, just don't take them and throw them in the garbage, release them. Everyone has there opinion and interpretation of the fishery. Just don't bang a guy having a little fun catching his limit. Life's to short."
481981,CLofchik,2010-07-03 17:50:00,854," Bah whaa haaa haaa haaaaa   Just to clear up a couple inaccuracies from John et al's posts, at best 10% of stocked steelhead were ever clipped in a given year, even in the US that has a million dollar machine that can clip 10k an hour.  In Ontario every clipped trout had to be snipped by hand which logistically makes it impossible to come anywhere close to 100% clipping rate.  So just because there's no fin clip it doesn't mean it's a wild fish.  And steelhead have been naturalized in Lake O long before smelt, alewife and lamprey's and the St.Lawrence Seaway.  They are much more part of the natural ecosystem than Atlantics ever will."
482464,john from craa,2010-07-05 03:55:00,39,"Good to see interest in learning more about the fish and discussion around it.  To agree with Clofchick, not all stocked steelies are clipped.  New York stopped clipping thier Chamber Creek fish in 2006 (500,000-700,000 yearlins per year stocked).  They only clip Skamania (Left Pec, Left vent clips, sometimes with an adipose).  Ontario clips the Right Pec, Right Vent or adipose only.  While I'm sure some are missed as Chris says, MNR does have review protocols and they don't miss many at clipping time (maybe 1%).  Most steelhead raised in a hatchery have visable fin wear from raceways and high density rearing.  The dorsal fin is the most obvious.  In my post above the bow Justin is releasing is a stocker (notice the dorsal is rubbed off).  Fish that have a crisp dorsal are more likely to be wild (not a perfect rule, but its pretty accurate).  If you look at other lake posts check out the dorsal on the steelhead.  Steelhead are often raised to 12-16 months in the hatchery causing the fin damage, whereas chinook are stocked at 3 months after hatch so fin damage is minimal.  If your looking for dinner it makes sense to keep a clipper and release a wild fish.  Most of the west coast fishery have adopted a release wild fish rules and keep clippers.  To correct clofchick, Steelhead were first introduced to Lake Ontario in the late 1800's (1885+/-).  Alewives, smelt and lamprey came 50 years earlier.  Atlantic salmon are still a native specie, even though the present fish being stocked are not genetically from Lake Ontario, they are the exact same species.  As for the regs, I agree one should not bash some guy for following the regs, but there is nothing wrong with offering new and/or factual information to encourage the angling public to protect our resources in the vacuum created by lack of action and enforcement activity by MNR.  Many fisheries have been destroyed by people following ""the regs"".  The government is slow at tackling most issues and MNR is so under funded it is downright scarry.  Great staff, just not enough of them or funds to conduct research or get into the feild to see what is going on enough.  The Atlantic cod fishery comes to mind.  The Severn Sound walleye fishery another.  And while I agree the floods circa 1980 did help grow the eastern steelhead population, I disagree with the analysis that higher silt on spawning beds is the cause of todays declines.  General impacts to the population (such as regional floods, lake biomass, juvenile predation in the lake, changing food web, weather impacts) all effect the whole population equally (i.e. each river population reacts similarily).  Yet our GTA steelhead declines have not been similar.  They crashed in different years, far apart and some have crashed by 75-80%, while others have remained fairly constant (ones with limited pressure).  I'll add a post in a few days with more details on the overall subject.  Its great to see so many people care enough to express their concerns or opinions.  Tight lines,  John"
482553,chessy,2010-07-05 16:11:00,610, What kills me is that it is the same people that say the MNR = ministry of no results when you bring something to there attention you get bashed all to hell for posting something that cant be planer than the nose on some peoples face. i encourage people to go to some fish cleaning satiions and see how many fish are beeing killed  THAT SHOULD NOT BE  bussiness people say they are good to eat and they are not . sometimes it is better to put a fish back for another day than to bring it in and brag about the number of fish you caught .thats what digital cameras are for . i urge people to read the safe eating guide to fish..  YES i know some smart people say that smokeing will kill you but when your told by someone who does it all day long that they are safe to eat they are belived . when infact they only tell you this so you come back to the town or city to fish some more and spend more of your money
482559,Headhunter,2010-07-05 16:30:00,5703,"Well Chessy, you should see how wonderful my roses are! I love special interest groups, especially when their special interest is their own! Go catch a fish, heck, maybe even post a report, but leave LEGAL fisherman alone! So maybe you won't be able to catch the trout seen in these pics next spring while their spawning, so what. I do believe you have made your point, you can sleep easy now. How about this question... how much extra license money comes in to the MNR as a result of charters on Lake O? Money that would not have been available to them, should there not be a charter industry on Lake O. Thanks goodness carp guys don't use pins!!! HH"

482583,asdve23rveavwa,2010-07-05 17:10:00,2690,"I second that!!!!  The laughing, nice one Terry!!!  I've been trying to stay out of this one, and, to tell you the truth am getting a bit bored of the whole thing...both points have been made. As for me, Juli and I went out on a charter on Saturday, as documented in my post. I caught four bows and one salmon.  Released three bows. Juli caught two salmon and three bows...we kept her three bows and one salmon, gave the other to another co-fisher who didn't get any large salmon that day.  So we kept a total of four out of seven rainbows...not a crazy number by any means, and, I do not fish Lake Ontario tribs for steelhead.  Thus these will more than likely be the only rainbows I keep for the whole year, out of this watershed. I usually do all of my steelheading on Lake Huron tribs, and, have no problem with the two fish limit.  In fact I like it.  However, while people are going out on charters and keeping fish that are legally caught and within legal limits, they should not be beat on by fellow fishermen!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! There is nothing wrong with an argument, as long as both sides have their facts straight."

480331,chessy,2010-06-28 14:10:00,610,yes salmon are good to eat but not over 30 inches and woman and children under 15 should not eat any over 20 inches and coho should not be eaten over 26 inches and no cohos over 26 for men and 16 inches for woman and children .. if  you concider that good to eat great
480336,alexcba,2010-06-28 14:16:00,634,hey chessy smoking will kill you to ya know.. people still do it.. lets just drop it and stop with the fussing
480341,rock34,2010-06-28 14:24:00,215,Dude...that is a ridiculous report.  Nicely done.  I have ever only had days like that in the Queen Charlotte Islands....Lake O is so much closer!
480344,Grimace,2010-06-28 14:31:00,2020,The food in the grocery stores will kill you as well.   I really do not think chessy is concerned with anyones health though.  I think it is a rough business to be in if you want to tell people that they should not be doing something they have a legal right to do.  You have to have a thick skin for that business.  So don't go getting your feelings hurt when your brought up on it.  Want the laws changed? Do what you think you would have to do to change them.  I am not so sure that I agree with the 5 fish deal either.  It is a put and take though.  I just do not get all the bashing of the charter guys. Personally I think it is more sporting to go out and track them down in the open water then to fish them on the spawn.
480346,rhare,2010-06-28 14:37:00,387,"Awesome stuff!! I heard that the coho's are on fire on the south shore.  Its unbelievable to watch some of the guys whine on here about the fish stocks. most of which have no clear idea of the amount of fish put into Lake O every year.  If you guys what to make a difference go get involved. Join a club like the CRAA or go put in some time at ringwood. I can tell you that I have seen none of the whiners out there getting their hands dirty. If you have time to fish and time to spend on the net complaining about how many fish other guys are keeping then you have time to go out and put in 2-3 days a year helping out. Right??  Apparently not.  FYI   Steelhead are very hard to release out on the lake, they fight until they are almost dead, I would rather see guys keep them then see them floating around on the lake."
480356,POLLIWOGG,2010-06-28 14:56:00,835,If you want to change the limit you must organize into a large group as the Gov. no longer has an ear for individuals. Then you get some signs and march down the streets of Toronto.  Good luck with that.
480380,chessy,2010-06-28 16:25:00,610,hey troutguy i get my hands dirty alot . usually 5 weeks a year  grimace i have no hard feelings against the charter boats but what i have a hard problem with is targeting them when things are slow . like you said they fight hard and usually belly up . some are released succsessfully . a good fisherman knows what temp to find salmon in and when they go out to 300 feet of water and rip rainbows all day that is a differnent story
480388,Fishmaster,2010-06-28 16:53:00,920,So what happens when your only 4 miles off shore in 130 fow and the bows are mixed in the same water as the kings are ...should i just go home tell the guys we can't fish cause there is bows in the lake lol...guess you don't know lake ont to well ...fishing has been far from slow best year ive seen since the 80s ...  keep up the good work USA stock millions of bows and salmon so we can have fun and eat ....
480400,BillsTheBassMan,2010-06-28 17:13:00,932,My down-rigging friends have had similar results this year on Lake Ontario and are getting great fish every weekend (up to 30lbs).  It seems that the bite is most definitely on on Lake O for now.
480408,NAW,2010-06-28 17:58:00,4022,Nice report and Pics man.  I'm Jealous!
480660,john from craa,2010-06-29 03:37:00,39,"Great action and kudos for releaseing some bows.  But I have to comment on some 'MYTHS' in this thread.  Lake Ontario steelhead are put and take (false).  The steelhead are mostly wild. Released steelhead in the lake will die (false - if handled properly and hot gill hooked)  Steelhead are mainly WILD fish in Lake Ontario, but the exact levels are hard to confirm since NY state recently stopped clipping their Chambers Creek stocking (700-900,000 fish per year).  They do clip all Skamania.  Ontario clips all of their steelhead stcoked (Right Ventral or Adipose).  Most hatchery rainbows have damage to their dorsal fin from life in the hatchery.  So if a fish is missing a fin it is prime for the keeping.  But wild steelhead need our help.  Runs in Ontario are depressed and over harvest (in lake and river) is a leading suspect.  The Pacific salmon are stocked by NY and Ontario for a put and take fishery.  All stocked chinook are adipose clipped back to 2008 year class (now hitting 10-15 pounds).  Natural reproduction of chinooks is very, very high.  NYSDEC estimates average WILD chinook reproduction from the Salmon River, NY alone to be 4 to 10 million salmon every year.  NYSDEC only stocks 1.8 million chinook into all NY state waters from the Black to Niagara.  MNR has no clue what our natural reproduction rates are because they have no money for propper assesment and hit the field long after most chinook juveniles leave rivers for the lake.  As for releasing bows in the lake, minimize out of water time, barbless hooks are great and consider unhooking smaller fish at the side of the boat without netting them.  Many of CRAA's tagged steelhead that have been caught and released in the lake have returned to the Credit to spawn again.  Catch and release works.  Steelhead catch rates have increased dramatically in the past three years (at their highest rate ever - NYSDEC 2009 report).  This happens to coincide when NY state lowered their steelhead limit to 1 fish, minimum 21"" on shore and 3 fish, minimum 21"" in the lake.  Steelhead returns to NY's Salmon River hatchery increased by 200% over the same period.  Yet the Ganaraska steelhead run continues to hold at 25% of its best run.  In the same period the Credit River's steelhead run has also increased by roughly 80% due to very high release rates.  I encourage all anglers to watch for fin clips on Lake Ontario steelhead and consider releasing fish with all their fins so they have a chance to spawn and improve our future fishing.  Tight lines,  John"
480766,canadadude,2010-06-29 14:23:00,769,"I agree with lower Steelhead limits, the 3-1 limit is adequate.I do find it hard to beleive that sportfishing is the only cause for lower returns of adult fish.Perhaps the Ganaraska is suffering from other factors ie degraded spawning areas, trout not being able to navigate the system to prime spawning areas. The Credit river stocks should increase now with the great work being done mainly for the Atlantic program, but also the Steelhead will take advantage the river rehabilitation,it's also nice that Steelhead are being transfered to proper spawning areas.It dosn't matter how many Trout are released if the fish are impeaded from spawning, I still beleive the biggest hurdle to jump concerning our Greatlakes Salmonoid populations is not overharvest but lack of access to available spawning beds.There are many other factors to consider in the success of the Salmon river trout from water quality to flows to rehablitation of spawning beds, ect.Like I said at the begining lower limits may help,but alot of other factors need to be addressed to see a large increase in Steelhead population.  On another note I think the Pen rearing practices for both salmon & trout our American neighbours are doing has drasticly increased there return rates.This maybe having a dramatic effect on returns in Ontario waters since American straglers are not finding rivers in Ontario to spawn."

481377,john from craa,2010-07-01 02:54:00,39,"Just to add to Canadadude's comments on steelhead recruitment or survival.  Causes for steelhead declines?  The Ganny fish have better access to quality spawning habitat today than they did in 1985-90 era (record years).  The habitat is as good or better.  Water flows are fairly stable on the long term average, again getting better.  Why the decline?  Most steelhead biologists I know suggest harvest (severe over harvest) is the main cause, but many other factors contribute.  LOMU stated harvest was around 50% for the Ganny population between lake and river (Bowlby and Stanfield 2000/2001). The Swank PhD thesis on Great Lakes steelhead and the Brule River studies indicate the maximum sustainable harvest for Great Lakes steelhead is 15%.  I could write a 50 page essay on this alone, but I doubt anyone realy wants to read all that much - we should be fishing.  The second major cause for decline is poor year classes.  A hot, dry summer can lead to 10% juvenile survival compared to a cold, wet summer in a decent stream.  As this depressed year class ages they are hit with angler harvest and natural mortality.  It then results in a poor spawning as they mature because not enough adults were alive to spawn.  Add 3 hot summers back to back and you have a population decline, or 3 cold summers and you have a population expansion.  Lower harvest helps to balance the population so bad years are buffered to ensure we have enough spawners (RSR - repleat spawner rate).  The RSR should target 50-70%.  The Ganny is lucky to break 40% these days and yet in the late 80's it was 60% plus.  Other factors include zebra muscles, lower lake biomass and lake survival.  However, lake survival should effect every river population the same.  Yet the ganny population crashed in 1991-93 and the Wilmot population crashed in 96 (2-3 years after the small stream was on a popular fishing show of the era many times).  Check out this link for info on a population that had all harvest stopped on a Great Lakes steelhead trib.  The population increased by 300-400%.  All other rivers around it with harvest have not changed and some have declined.  Spawning access is also constant.  Only harvest changed.  www.northshoresteelhead.com/images/Slide1web.JPG  If the population can handle 15% harvest, great...lets eat.  But what happens when year after year we kill 30% of the population.  We are left with crumbs.  Sadly, the regulations are often not enough and they do not change fast enough.  And keep in mind, if you catch a clipped steelie it is a put and take stocked fish.  That is perfect for the table.  But consider letting the wild ones swim!  Tightlines,  John"

481456,esoxansteel,2010-07-01 18:03:00,1307,"Further to Johns comments the flood of 1980 at the Ganny and other eastern flows ie Wilmot cleaned out the spawning beds of silt, providing many years of quality spawning for steelhead and excellent survival rates as well, as the populations increased thru the 1980s until 1989 where record numbers were recorded in all eastern tribs, thru normal springs with normal runoff siltation occurs naturally once again, covering prime spawning gravel and reducing natural spawning habitat, hense the decline in steelhead populations, the flood in Peterborough where I live in 2004 had it happened 20 miles south along the lakeshore would have once again set the tables for another 10 or so years of increased steelhead populations, thats my 2 cents maybe a little more  "
481460,fishhunter,2010-07-01 19:08:00,604,"What alot of people dont know is after the big flood in the 80's thousands of pond rainbows from the upper ganny ponds got mixed in to the numbers of wild fish. I have fished the Ganny for 30 years now and have seen alot of things change on this river system. Places were you had miles of great spawning water not wiped out by silt. People are fast to say its because of people are keeping to many fish in the river and the lake but they never realy look at all the facts. Did you know that the Ganny is up a few thousand bows from last year run and the counter was put in late, did you also know that a few thousand bows now run in the fall too that are not counted. Bottom line is, fish are for everyone to enjoy and no one has a right to say anything about another angler{s} that follows the law."

480106,Fishmaster,2010-06-27 23:43:00,920,people thats not alot of fish ...gota remeber guys these people only fish once a year ...so i think 5 fish for a full year is not bad ....Lake Ontario fish are good to eat...
480108,danbouck,2010-06-27 23:45:00,4380, If you could afford 1 charter a year wouldn't you keep 5 fish.
480109,[email protected],2010-06-27 23:46:00,119,"  if its once a year, I can understand that.  they may be good to eat, but are they good for you to eat? debate amongst yourselves, I would never do so, but that's just me.  Nice day on the water"
480114,lew,2010-06-27 23:52:00,12766,"WTG Steve, looks like you guys had a great day on the water."
480115,alexcba,2010-06-27 23:57:00,634,nice day..  hope this thread doesn't get swept up like the other one.
480127,tightline,2010-06-28 00:09:00,322,Was out on the Lake in Salmon Doctor saturday too we went 57 for 65...Crazy Crazy day!!!!
480137,Guest Johnny Bass,2010-06-28 00:40:00,0,WOW! What a great day! I guess these guys pay decent coin for a charter and 5 fish each is not that bad. Especially when most of them were Salmon.
480160,chessy,2010-06-28 01:13:00,610,"its  coming the mnr is going to open up the ""cold Water fishery"" to discussions.. i would love for them to have a limit of 10 salmon and keep the rainbows to 2 . that said . been out many a time you either fish for rainbows or salmon. find the right temp and hold steady . i have witness to many rainbows being killed in port hope area. just for the sake of charter boats saying they caught fish... to each there own .. but when the limit comes . dont complain"
480173,a.cortellessa,2010-06-28 01:38:00,142,awesome fish.. sounds like an unreal day.
480188,BillM,2010-06-28 01:49:00,17367,"Looks like the southern shore was insane like my buddy said, they went something like 40 for 50 on Sat, lol.  Nice to see mostly salmon strung up and only a few bows!!  Gotta release those steelies!"
480237,corvette1,2010-06-28 02:35:00,1765,awesome day steve congrats
480280,wormdunker,2010-06-28 09:03:00,1711,Thanx for the pix.  Looks like a great day!!
480299,fishhunter,2010-06-28 11:54:00,604,MY GOD. I WISH THE BOW HUGGERS WOULD GET A LIFE. THEY ARE A FISH THAT EVRYONE HAS A RIGHT TO KEEP OR RELEASE. I THINK WE LIVE IN A FREE COUNTRY WHERE A PERSON HAS A CHOICE WHAT THEY WANT TO DO. THE FISH ARE PUT IN THE LAKE FOR PEOPLE TO ENJOY HOW EVER THEY WANT. DO NOT TRY TO TELL OTHER WHAT TO DO!!!  NOW GREAT PICS AND GREAT CATCH. DONT LET THE FISH HUGGERS GET TO YOU
480300,John,2010-06-28 12:08:00,2956,"Looks like a great day Steve, congrat's!"
480302,Roy,2010-06-28 12:33:00,13728,"Yes, everyone has a right to their opinion. This is however a fishing community. No one enjoys being harassed every time they take the time to post a report. If you don't like the catch limits, have them changed. Don't come on here belly aching about seeing pictures of fish on a fishing board. Please keep this in mind the next time you post."
480304,lew,2010-06-28 12:43:00,12766," One of the main reasons many of us no longer bother to post fishing reports anymore Roy. Far too many ""experts"" around here who seem to take pleasure in screwing up fishing stories.  Just like this one, Steve always puts up excellent reports with very detailed descriptions as the where the fish are, what depth and even the best baits to use, yet some folks still try to ruin this post."
480305,Grimace,2010-06-28 12:46:00,2020,Nice shooting.  My riggers will be working ot next weekend.
480306,asdve23rveavwa,2010-06-28 12:47:00,2690," I am sooooooo sick of seeing people getting beat up for posting pics of fish they have kept. Going out with Vinnimon, Spincast and Lloyd on Saturday.  Darn right I'm going to keep a few for the smoker and a fresh fish dinner!!!"
