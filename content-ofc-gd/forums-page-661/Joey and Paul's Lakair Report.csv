Spiels tarp also got a little torn up on that trip but not as bad as yours. Oh well,we all made it home in one piece with the boats so all is good. I still can't believe they turned you and Paul around where they did. What a bummer....Oh,and whats this SpecialK thing.Me thinks I have to have a little talk with my buddy Spiel Cheers"

480434,Spiel,2010-06-28 19:22:00,9065,"Sheeeeesh, how many pictures you got in your post Joey? Every time I try to see 'em (3 times now) my ole puter freezes right up."
480437,Roy,2010-06-28 19:28:00,13728,There are 58 in post #1 and 18 in post#2
480440,Spiel,2010-06-28 19:35:00,9065,"  Crikey, me thinks I need a new puter.  "
480548,lew,2010-06-28 23:16:00,12766,"Well, I was finally able to see the pictures Joey, I got rid of a few big programs in the puter that I didn't need and everything is good now.  Your pictures turned out excellent as always !!  Congrats to Paul on that musky, she's a beaut,  except for a few battle scars"
480560,Joey,2010-06-28 23:48:00,9122,"Glad you got to see them Lew, she is a beaut,in her own special way  I forgot to mention another rock to watch out for.  We took a piece off our skeg coming out of Muskrat.  We went over it 3 times and nothing, then wham on the 4th.  It is just before the cottage on the island.  You can't see it in the water, but it is on the navigation map if you have one.  So coming into muskrat, after Tombstone, and after the other Rock island, just before you have to go through the narrow part between the cottage on the island and the two milk bottles marking rocks on the east side.  Hope that makes sense.  Just be careful, your boat probably doesn't sit as low as ours, but it took a good chunk out and darn, makes you want to cry when you hear that noise  Joey"
480615,fishhunter,2010-06-29 02:02:00,604,Great report and pics!
480697,lew,2010-06-29 11:27:00,12766," Thanks again Joey, I think I know where you mean....maybe  Jeeeez, it took us all these years to learn where the bad spots were up there and now we have to start learing all over again.    Maybe you wanna book off sick next week and come up as my guide ??"
480699,Guest Johnny Bass,2010-06-29 11:34:00,0,"Great Report! That looks like a nice looking Musky to me. The water looks very fishable, and the area is teaming with wildlife!"
480700,lew,2010-06-29 11:44:00,12766,"You'd like it up there Johnny, it's absolutely gorgeous !!"

480765,Joey,2010-06-29 14:18:00,9122,It is held at www.lakair.com and we have it there at the same place every year.  A little piece of heaven.  Joey
480772,Squid,2010-06-29 14:37:00,1656,awesome report Joey and great photography!!! Did the gang manage a fish fry on tombstone this time? Nice musky Paul!!!
480779,John,2010-06-29 14:47:00,2956," No fish fry on Tombstone this year Pete, that was a great day, we will have to repeat it."
480806,ChrisK,2010-06-29 15:34:00,2772,I'm sure if we planned it for next year Kevin would have most of the shore lunch stuff ready for us to use. Perhaps do it on the Friday before the pike tourney ?? I could arrange it with Kevin.
480808,Rich Clemens,2010-06-29 15:38:00,3131, That was a great time.  Did that my first year up there.   Would be great to do it again.
480809,John,2010-06-29 15:44:00,2956, Sounds like a stellar plan Chris!
480827,lew,2010-06-29 16:46:00,12766,Ya can't beat a Tombstone shore lunch  
479822,Joey,2010-06-27 01:58:00,9122,"This year I decided to head up to Lakair a day early as Paul was on afternoons and did not get off work until 11 p.m. on Friday night.  I packed up the van with the tent and gazebos and drove up early Friday morning.  Much of the crew were there to meet me and Art, Spiel, Gerritt and a few others helped me set up camp. A big thanks to all who helped me with that task, much appreciated. Friday night shenanigans were a hoot and lots of laughs were had all around.  Gerritt and his lovely lady Jackie fed me burgers and potato salad (without eggs   ) Friday night.  That was great and it was a pleasure to meet you Jackie. ChrisK was also nice enough to take me out for a pickerel fish and he managed one.  We ended up making that a nightly ritual and I enjoyed every moment of it, even if those pesky pickerel were hard to find.  I enjoyed the great talks we had Chris, and the nice swim we managed to sneak in there.  Paul arrived early Saturday morning and launched the boat, while I was busy helping ChrisK make a moose meat chili for the fish fry.  The Pike Derby got underway around 11:30 a.m. or so and just as we were about to blast to our favorite pike haunt, the new aluminum prop Paul bought due to the low water levels on Nipissing started cavitating.  We were going nowhere fast.  I'm pretty sure Art sabotaged the whole pike derby for us as he insisted I call Paul and tell him to get an aluminum prop     Back to the docks we went and Paul changed the prop back to the regular one we usually have on there.  Joe supervised as he was having some allergy problems and didn't get out for the derby.  Thanks bud!!  We had no entries for the tourny but the prize table was abundant once again and everyone got a prize and then some.  Great table this year TJ and Monique.  The fish fry was delicious as usual and all the salads were tasty!!!  We all had some good laughs and the evening silliness resumed once again.  ChrisK won this year - congrats Bud!!!  Most people left Sunday, but the remainder of us, Gerritt, Jackie, Spiel, ChrisK (now known as SpecialK), Paul and myself had a nice steak cookout, with lots of Beans  I'm going to add pics in order of people, fish, scenery and misc shots.  The OFC Gang pics:        Monique, you're such an attention checkout girl                                        How many people does it take to open a can of beans without a can opener?        Fish Pics:  I'll have to start with the highlight of our trip, Paul caught this 46"" beast on Monday afternoon.  She's a beauty in her own way, but man, a face only a mother could love.  The poor girl had one eye covered over with glaze, we assume she was blind in that eye.  She had cuts, chunks missing and sores all over.  Must have been from spawning.  She swam away strong and was a real fighter.  Just an awesome start to the week.                                           Scenery and animals pics:                                    cont.........."
479823,Joey,2010-06-27 01:58:00,9122,"Misc Shots:                                These guys followed us around it seemed all week.  Every time we were out fishing, so were they.  I'm pretty sure they are spies or something     Was great seeing you two Rich and Patsy, we enjoyed our evening visits.       The drive home was going great until we hit about 10Kms north of Barrie.  Then, traffic stopped and if you can believe this, they made us turn around on the highway, across the grass median, and go back north due to the G20 summit convoy!!!!! I mean, they couldn't divert us at the first turn off or anything, they had to turn us around almost at the 400.  Complete, unprepared incompetence if you ask me.  We also had an unfortunate incident on the way home, the boat tarp blew and ripped open.  What a shame.  I'm sure that will be a pretty penny to have fixed - OUCH!!!       So that's our Lakair trip for the year, had a blast.  Thanks Kevin and Leslie for having us.  Enjoyed or chat last night and you look great Leslie.  Love the tan!!!  Also, I'd like to thank Art and Joe for the Alpaca hair.  I'm going to try to make some lures with them.  And I really do love the earrings Art, thanks so much.  Joey"
479826,Sandbag,2010-06-27 02:02:00,533,Great report Joey and i'm glad you had a blast.  All I'm gettin is the red X insead of the pic's though.  Cheers  Craig  Disregard...getting them now  Thx for the report
479827,TJQ,2010-06-27 02:09:00,7806,Awesome pics and report Joey!! Im saving them now!! Glad ya got momma fish!! Nice!
479833,highdrifter,2010-06-27 02:26:00,2534,Beauty pics sug!!  Shame I couldn't make it..  Would have been nice to see you and Paul again..  That and doing the crunk hoochy dance around the fire!!  Awesome.
479835,Skud,2010-06-27 02:28:00,739,Great pics Joey. Wish I was there.
479836,Handlebarz,2010-06-27 02:30:00,3790,Dang great read and lots of Pics thanks for taking the time Joey it was Like I was there with ya all.
479841,irishfield,2010-06-27 02:36:00,26272,I like to stand up and salute those too Dan !!  Some beauty pics there hun and you've really grasped the composition on all of them!!  Glad you had a great week... wish we could have joined you but texting was always fun!  Tell Paul to slow down.. the cover isn't meant for 135!!  I've had no issues with mine.. same Lund sport trac cover.. but I don't have that black stitching across below the window. Was there anything in the bow that might have started the tear once the air pressure pushed it down??
479846,danc,2010-06-27 02:53:00,4677,Best report yet Joey. Thanks..
479847,Joey,2010-06-27 02:56:00,9122," Thanks Hun.  As for the tarp, there is a vent hole that started it, where the pole goes to keep the tarp up.  I followed Paul all the way home and we only did 110 most of the way, until we got diverted of course, then only 85 down the back roads!!!  Joey"
479871,irishfield,2010-06-27 03:56:00,26272,"Okay.. that makes sense! The vent hole.. I caught mine last year.. it's two piece, the bottom threads on. Mine had come lose and the open edge of the cut hole was showing beyond the plastic ring. I recentered and tightened it up. Bet yours slipped and then tore."
479881,Dutch,2010-06-27 04:28:00,831,"Nice report and great pics.  Thanks for sharing.  Shame about the cover - I never tow with one, ever.  Just not worth it.  Even if a cover says it is towable - never seen one that can tighten up enough to withstand the winds."
479886,lew,2010-06-27 08:34:00,12766,"I can only get a couple of the pictures to open Joey but it sounds like you & Paul had a fantastic week up there. Sorry I missed you this year, but a few of us are heading up next Saturday for a week.  I'm assuming the 46""er Paul got was a musky ??  Tough luck with the boat cover and the traffic screw-up, but other than that it's great to hear you got home OK"
479889,Terry,2010-06-27 09:54:00,14456,great report and photos   I really have to try to get to one of those trips
479891,MCTFisher9120,2010-06-27 10:16:00,3761,"Great report, thanks for sharing!"
479899,Rich Clemens,2010-06-27 11:25:00,3131,"Great spending some time with you folks again.  Glad we had some great company for the week after the GTG.  And THANKS again to Paul for helping me get that ""Dang"" Tracker boat lined up properly on the trailer.  First time I had her in the water, I didn't have that problem.  See what a lack of fishing success will do to a guy.  Many thanks Paul.    Hope to see you both next year - looking forward to it.  Congrats on the Musky.  I wasn;t even able to raise one up for a sniff this year.  I'll try to put up my report in a day or so.  EDIT:   We had smooth sailing all the way through to the border.  We only had to wait for a couple cars to get through.  We left Lakair around 5:15am."
479901,Roy,2010-06-27 11:26:00,13728,"Fantastic report once again, Hon. Was great to see you again though we never chat long enough. You've got some stellar pics there during your stay and a mouse key for Paul on Monday! WOOOOOOOOOHOOOOOOOOOO! It was wonderful seeing you again and looking forward to seeing you both again soon."
479916,Fish Farmer,2010-06-27 12:27:00,2234,Great report and pictures  . I allways say one of these years I'll have to do the Lakeair trip. Thanks for posting.
479949,Joey,2010-06-27 14:40:00,9122," Yes, it was a musky Lew, too bad you can't open the pics.  BTW, it was not from your bay, we only went there twice the whole stay and I caught 1 pike there, that was it.  There are very few weeds there now, actually anywhere on the lake for that matter, so its tough fishing there.  Also, beware of a rock that is just underwater between the south tip of the island and the red buoy.  We were just casting and a boat went by and the waves crested it, that's how we found it.  Glad we didn't go blasting over it like we have before in that same spot.  Go slow my friend, go slow!!  Have a great trip.  Joey"
479953,lew,2010-06-27 14:57:00,12766,"Thanks Joey, I'll watch for that rock. I remember a couple years back there were no weeds there either and the fishing was really bad. We'll just have to spend a bit more time in our search.  Really lookin forward to getting back up there."
479969,Tybo,2010-06-27 15:35:00,1373,It was great seeing Old and new face this year and yes you to TJ. Thank you to all the people that help Joey set up camp.Should do the same next year.Show up and your camp is ready.  And thanks again TJ for allowing me to be a part of the great get together. I almost get a warm fuzzy feeling
479974,Beans,2010-06-27 15:47:00,3339,"Terrific report w/pics Joey...  Ya gotta love the pic of Spiel and Brook pulling a ""Roy""    In case no one knows what a ""Roy"" is...This is a ""Roy""  "
479990,SlowPoke,2010-06-27 16:50:00,2984,Great report Joey! That boat cover shouldn't cost you a dime to fix. Percher blew his out on the first trip to Quinte and they repaired it. It's been fine ever since.
480047,pikeguy,2010-06-27 20:27:00,195,"It was great to meet you Joe & Paul, Visit may have bean short but maybe next time Those are some  great pics you have there but i  notice that Roy had his PFD on when he was on shore but the other pic he is in the boat and not wearing it. lol but i get the felling thats Roy  hoping to see you both next time. take care and tell Paul i want to see pics of  him catching  the big one "
480056,SlowPoke,2010-06-27 21:04:00,2984,Roy wears his PFD on shore when there is a chance of rain. You'll also notice him avoiding deep puddles.
