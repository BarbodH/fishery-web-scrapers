482529,ra95,2010-07-05 14:40:00,49,Lip of Bomber A Series (crankbait question) The price of Bomber is good but the lip of these crankbait fails. I bought some on the sale in Lebaron last year and 4 out of 6 has broken on lip. Square A's lip was off at the third casting. I love Bomber Fat A/Square A for its super floating and wobbling. Any one has a suggestion on the replacement? I am wondering if I have to spend 10~15 dollar's crankbait to get a stronger lip?

482536,uglyfish,2010-07-05 15:09:00,981,"ive broken lips on 2 or 3 different rapala DT crankbaits. one was the first cast outta the package. contacted the company and was told to go buy a new one lol. so, guy was a dick... but i see his point on not being able to replace it. but i have 100's of other rapala cranks, live target, bomber, cotton cordell, and a host of others and have never broken a lip on them... just landed a bad batch i guess. with mass production, ur always gonna have  few come through that dont last long."
482537,Spiel,2010-07-05 15:10:00,9065," I'm with Bucktail on this one. I have lots of Bombers and have never had one fail, mind you they are all older than 10 years. Perhaps they've shifted production to cut costs, not unheard of.   "
482549,ra95,2010-07-05 16:06:00,49,Maybe I fished crankbait on semi-heavy cover too much? I believe ripping from the grass is the only way to trigger the bite ...
482552,Spiel,2010-07-05 16:11:00,9065,"   I agree whole heartedly, I rip weeds often with my assortment of Bombers and have never had an issue.  But if this is a common issue with the newer product I may need to consider  auctioning off my old stock to the highest bidder."
482557,JohnF,2010-07-05 16:29:00,3494,Is it possibly about fishing water too shallow for the depth of the lure? It's tempting to bottom bounce but for some lures the lip is gonna take all the stress. I bottom bounce weighted tubes all the time but there's no lip to break off.  JF

482572,Roy,2010-07-05 17:00:00,13728,Never had problems with Bombers but I've had more than a few lip problems with Ripplin' Redfins. Lips never broke they just came clean out. They were decent baits but I have never purchased another.
