481854,Mattones,2010-07-03 03:53:00,587,Other then swinging a hammer and banging nails everyday for the past 5 years in construction I finally got to do what I enjoyed doing in Highschool! Wood working! The girlfriend has been bothering me for the past month about building her a chest to keep some belongings for stuff when we buy a house in another year or so.  I finally said okay and bought the wood and went at it today. From 2-5pm I figured I did pretty good and my skills were still upto par! Pretty hard to mess up a big box! haha!         Not finished yet I am going to router the top back board and give the entire thing a good sand down before i let the girlfriend stain it! I wasent planning on putting legs on it but the girlfriend insisted I must.

481857,Mattones,2010-07-03 04:05:00,587,It is actually a wooden design piece that the girlfriend saw and wanted to have it put on the chest. We picked it up at Rona for like $10 bucks. It blends in well.

481916,DRIFTER_016,2010-07-03 13:48:00,10439,Looks good!!! Be sure to condition the wood with this stuff before staining so you get better more even coverage of your stain. Without pre stain conditioning pine and other softwoods tend to streak and take stain unevenly. Make sure to post a pic of the finished product.

481936,Mattones,2010-07-03 15:09:00,587,I did indeed.  I will be sure to get that pre stain stuff
