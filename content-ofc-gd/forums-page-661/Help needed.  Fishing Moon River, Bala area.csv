I was wondering if anyone has had any luck fishing there and could give me a few tips or what to look for? anything really would help.  I was there for a few days this past weekend and had no luck.  I got one bite and landed a smallie of the dock! that was after hours on the boat!!!!  I belive we are in Gaunt's Bay?  Thank you in advance for any help.   Rodman."
