The last two weeks however I have been able to free up a lot of time to be on the water.  I was entered in the Casey Cup tournament on Simcoe last weekend, a 130 boat bass tournament.  I spent 3 full days on the water in the week before the tournament.  On the monday I spent 10 hours with the trolling motor on high just looking for fish without a rod in my boat, thats exhausting, but worth while.  I found some nice smallies and 2 BIG largemouth in the middle of nowhere... WPT WPT, come back for them. Friday I explored a different area of the lake and found some really nice 4-5 pound smallmouth.  Some very key fish to hopefully go with my two big largies. Saturday I finally got to fish, I love opener!  I didnt want to sting most of my fish, so I checked on my largies... sTILL THERE! We then proceeded to fish some smallie areas just to get an idea of what they're eating... Found a bunch of fish in the 4 - 4.5 pound range.  Landed 6 lost 2 on the day but not really targeting our chosen areas.  Cal with on of our smallies on Saturday, didnt take many pics obviously.  Sunday was tournament day!  We blasted out of Orillia through the narrows.  We headed to one of our smallie areas first and as we were about half way there from the narrows, our engine died on my partner's boat.  We dropped the trolling motor, put it on high and fished our way back to the launch without stopping and made it back with 5 minutes to spare!  So upsetting!  We put a lot of time into this tournament, never got to see one of our spots and my partner's engine needs some serious fixin'.  We managed to scrape up a limit of largemouth in Couchiching weighing 14.20lbs   I had a few clients out on Sparrow Lake early in the week for some largemouth fishing.  Fishing was excellent with fish in a transitional period and feeding hard.  We took about 20 fish on senkos, husky jerks and 7inch power worms, all released.     I took Wednesday to fish a fun tournament with an old buddy on Rice Lake.  I personally dont really like Rice Lake, its not my style of fishing, but I figured I'd give it a go with him.  We blasted of at 7:00am with heavy wind and by 10am we had about 11 lbs in the livewell, nothing special but were starting to catch them good.  All of a sudden the plug on his trolling motor started smoking and melted, we unplugged it and found that the pos and neg wires had melted together and caused the short.  It was scary for a minute and we had no trolling motor anymore.  I'm feeling like a curse at this point.  We caught whatever drift we could in 35km winds and caught some fish, but all small and nothing to help.  We managed 6th place out of 19 boats, less than 1.5 pounds out of 1st place.  Must have been a tough day even with a trolling motor.  What happens when 2 fiends go fishing together   Thursday, I was supposed to guide the same gentlemen from earlier in the week but an illness caused a cancellation and they re-booked for next week.  So I did nothing really, tidied the boat and re-spooled my lines.  Today I took out an old friend who I havent fished with for many years.  We decided to go to Couchiching as it's his favourite lake.  We started up shallow and found nothing!  Almost 3 hours with 1 smallie around 1.5 pounds.  Brutal.  We moved out deeper and found a good pod of solid fish.  Mixed largies and smallies.  Caught about 10 fish in the 2-5 pound range all on jigs and dropshots (two total opposites haha)    Busy week!  I'll take tomorrow to rest up and tourney on Sunday!"

Lots of summer and fall to go, but, I can't wait to get out with my ice hut on Simcoe and use some of the techniques we learned from you."
