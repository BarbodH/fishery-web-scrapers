482212,Pigeontroller,2010-07-04 15:17:00,2793,"Started Flipping again after years of not doing it...Man I forgot how much I enjoy it! Picked up a St.Croix Mojo Bass Flippin rod last year, can't say enough good things about it! Anyway, went out this morning for a few hours in my local Bass haunt...Put 2 nice Largie's in the boat, both came out from under sunken logs, classic spots in this water body...   First one was about 3 lbs.    Second one went on the scales...4.43 lbs.    "

482230,Terry,2010-07-04 16:24:00,14456,nice  nothing like flipping..
482242,Guest Johnny Bass,2010-07-04 16:50:00,0,Very nice! I love flippin for buckets. Have yet to catch a jig and pig fish this year. Caught a small one flippin a tube but that's about it! Thanks for sharing.
482247,ehg,2010-07-04 16:53:00,2666,"Nice going Dax, beauty fish  !"
482260,skankbutta,2010-07-04 17:11:00,32,Nice fish there.
482299,splashhopper,2010-07-04 19:11:00,2931,"Great looking largies.   does standing on an over hanging tree branch and tossing a senko to the outer edge of the fallen tree count as ""flipping"".  My friends think I have flipped my mind when they see me crawl out on it.  But dang, it's fun to catch one when teetering on a branch like circus performer"
482399,WeedLine,2010-07-04 23:30:00,322,The jig bite has been hot so far this season. They are engulfing jigs hard. Good job on those beauties.

482655,fish-miester,2010-07-05 20:50:00,864,UGGHHHHH i have been doing a tonn of flippin and well doin pretty good myself. then i see this pic and i just neeeeed to go again
482676,bare foot wader,2010-07-05 21:42:00,1354,"jig n pig fish always tend to be quality fish for me....usually better than average and there's just something about making a perfect pitch to that tiny little spot way back in there, line twitches, hammerin back and pulling out a big fat bass....love it"
482683,fish-miester,2010-07-05 22:00:00,864,"Bare foot you got that right, nothing better then those perfect flips.. kinda like the other day skipped a jig ever so perfectly under a center piece of a comunity dock watched my line twitch and slammin the hook into a 3+ ending up loosing her boat side tho.. what a heart break. haha but thats just a part of the game"
482703,bare foot wader,2010-07-05 22:37:00,1354," I think it's a bit like fly fishing for me....fish or no fish just making the perfect cast is pretty good on its own too  I'm a fan of calling my fish....she's gonna be right about there, perfect flip, BAM! right where she's supposed to be.....haha, pisses my buddies off"
482706,fish-miester,2010-07-05 22:40:00,864,"   haha i know exactly what you mean, I only started flippin last year mean while my buddies have done it for a few now. and they get so mad when i call my shot and or when i make the nicer flips.. all i have to say to them is practice makes perfect.  except now im on to skippin jigs etc as far under the obstacle"
