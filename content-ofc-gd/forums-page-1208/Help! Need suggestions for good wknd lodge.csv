Most of the group will be driving up from Toronto area, so I figure somewhere in the Sudbury / North Bay area would be ideal. That way we are close to civilization if we want to venture out for some nightlife too.  I would really appreciate it if any of you coud share your expertise and suggest a few places. I'm not a regular angler, and live in the UK so my local knowledge is lacking.  Many thanks,  Trout_Rookie"

Some of the operators even have Beer taps on board, so you can get primed before heading out for the nightlife in the city.  It will certainly cost less when you factor in the cost of fuel to drive 4 hours away...  Here is the operator based out of Port Credit that I used when I organized a company fishing trip for the guys... http://www.salmonexpress.com/index.htm  Tony"
