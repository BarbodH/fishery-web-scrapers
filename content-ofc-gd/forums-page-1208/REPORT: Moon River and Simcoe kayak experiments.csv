77029,snag,2007-05-30 15:12:00,1932," Mam?   Yeah, you can see his girth. I'm still upset. Those bass are calling   You are right. I'd like to think my skill helped out-fish 4 other guys, but luck was a big issue for sure!   If I catch a big one in T.O. while in the kayak, I'll see if it can take me to Hamilton or Niagara to meet up with you! A big ol' carp should do the trick!"

76134,snag,2007-05-28 15:55:00,1932,"Greetings,  I recently came into aquiring 2 kayaks. One inflatable and one river kayak (from OFNer LOVE2DRIFT) I'm just learning the whole kayak thing and managed to both lose a monster pike and our dinner (After I caught the dinner pike it broke the stringer!) In addition, I will seek guidance from JEDIANGLER for kayak photographic wisdom.   Had a quick 1 1/2 day trip to the Moon River Basin with some buds. They all got skunked and yours truly caught 6 Pike and a bunch of very nice OOS bass. (I meant to catch some walleyes but Mr.Beer forbid me from entering a watercraft at night!)   Met the owner of Moon Basin Marina, Kevin  Kevin gave me some great advice and warned me that where we are camping is a fish sactuary for another week, DOH!! If you want to find out more go here: Moon Basin Marina  Here are 2 dudes out of 5. That's Love2drifts kayak     Working on ruining any chances of night fishing by boat:    Monster that got away. 17-20lbs. easy I have to admit, I've lost sleep over this It gave me a brief tour of the bay before spitting my hook.    Off the dock    Come to Papa    Did a pit stop in Simcoe to try the inflatable.   Crazy pike make you nervous in one of these   After nailing a bunch, I switched to the beloved sluggo   Snake   One for the road   I was not keen to stick my finger in this pikes face. YUCK!   *Communication terminated* Please stand by"
76145,ccmtcanada,2007-05-28 16:26:00,7971,Hey Snag!  Great report...looked like you had a great time up there losing that 20 pounder.  Oops...did I say that out loud??? Sorry!!!  That sure was a monster!!!  It looks like an amazing place to fish...a little different than the TO Islands that's for sure!  Congrats on a successful trip....  Oh yeah...why the change back to SNAG from SNOG?  Just keeping us on our toes?? haha.
76149,jediangler,2007-05-28 16:46:00,1923,"Looks like a great weekend with some heartache (the one that got away) and some reward. That's a tight cockpit on that yak but I bet it flies on the water. The stealth factor in a kayak will usually produce more fish for you than anyone in a boat or canoe. I posted a few pics of my camera mount in the post ""Kayaking for Pike"" from last Saturday if you want to check it out. Hopefully I'll be posting a report with some musky pics after this coming weekend. If you want to read up on some kayak fishing check out these forums with kayak fishermen from all over the U.S. and the world.  http://kfs.infopop.cc/groupee/forums"
76157,Joey,2007-05-28 17:04:00,9122,"Great report Snag.  FYI, there was some jerk on here recently calling himself Snog and I think he was trying to impersonate you.  Keep an eye out for him, he ""not all there"" if you know what I mean  Joey"
76161,Rizzo,2007-05-28 17:12:00,4754,great report.  Man that is one sick donkey looking pike.  Too bad about the big one that got away
76186,snag,2007-05-28 17:57:00,1932," Yeah, most people would have been happy to lose 20 lbs.!  My name is seasonal, I think"
76187,snag,2007-05-28 17:58:00,1932," Thanks,  I will definately check it out. Your right, I could hardly breath in there (I had my feet and back packed with gear too!)"
76190,snag,2007-05-28 18:00:00,1932,"  Thanks for the warning, No worries, my hand puppets will protect me."
76191,setomonkey,2007-05-28 18:01:00,872,"Sounds like a fun way to fish, I've never been in a kayak.  Mike"
76193,ehg,2007-05-28 18:06:00,2666,"Great report! That pike looks like it took a prop to the face. You have the good, bad and ugly all in there.  Peace,  ehg"
76375,snag,2007-05-29 02:00:00,1932,   The gash-like deformity was full of bubbles. Ugh!
76487,snag,2007-05-29 13:25:00,1932," Edit: I tried to find the info on a post by CCMT, but had no luck. I think it is:  Lymphosarcoma of Pike  This is an epizootic condition in northern pike and muskellunge in certain regions (i.e. Lake Ontario). The lesion develops as a purple ulcerative cutaneous mass on the head, mouth and flank with invasion into the adjacent muscle and metastasis to spleen, liver and kidney. A type-C Retrovirus is believed to be the cause of this disease.  "
76492,Bly,2007-05-29 13:36:00,1556,"Thanks for sharing your original pictures and post but that last picture is going to make me skip my breakfast..yuck!!   Sounds like you had a great trip and the new kayak a fun investment....looking forward to reading about more of your ""boat"" adventures!   Bly"

76676,Guest Johnny Bass,2007-05-29 21:28:00,0,"Nice pike,well except the last one. I gotta give this moon river basin a try one of these days."
76793,snag,2007-05-30 01:10:00,1932," Yup,  Wish I went earlier though. Caught a 4-5lbs. OOS LM bass. It was followed by 3 other bass with one that looked bigger! I am sooooo going back to that spot.  There were tons of Gar there (well I saw 5 in one day)  Thanks again for the info"
76795,snag,2007-05-30 01:12:00,1932," Her?  Why Douglas,  You naughty, naughty man!"

76846,Cookslav,2007-05-30 02:41:00,1457,"Looks like a great time,  I've stayed there at the Marina before and its a very beautifull area for sure plus there are some real bruisers to be had. But fishing can be hot and cold...looks like you hit it just right.  That big Pike would be a blast in the Kayak for sure!!!  Cheer,"
76951,Hellfish,2007-05-30 12:33:00,308,"Good report, gotta love getting out in a kayak, wait till u get a huge one on and pulls ya round like a little electric trolling motor. And that last pic of the pike was disgusting, gotta love bacteria infections"
