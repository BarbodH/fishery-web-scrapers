76523,Puckhead,2007-05-29 14:48:00,377,Sorry Lew - my condolences to you and your family.
76535,LipDip,2007-05-29 15:16:00,39,"That's a tough blow, Lew. I had the pleasure of spending a long wknd on BOQ with the two brothers and that still is one of the best trips I've ever had. Ed and Lew are actually very, very much alike, easy to tell that they were brothers and close ones. Always quick with a laugh, always positive, totally at home in the outdoors (that was pretty apparent watching them fish that area of BOQ for three days). Ed was a master over that campstove/fire too. Spahghetti and meatballs with garlic bread was one of the best meals he did up....4 or 5 of us under a tarp they'd set up in a 3 day downpour and thoroughly enjoying the whole thing. An energetic and upbeat guy who will be missed by anyone and everyone he met, me included. What a great sample of pics Lew, you captured the man to a tee, excatly as I remember him, that's for sure. Hang in there Lew, we're all pulling for you."
76546,lew,2007-05-29 15:36:00,12767,"This would be the fish'n trip your talkin about Dip, cold wet and miserable weather, but still an incredible time.  Don't think I've ever fished in such heavy rain in my entire life and Ed & I often laughed about how wet it was and how it never let up the whole time we were there.  I'll be continuing the Quinte tradition in Ed's honor next year and your always welcome Bud.    "

76233,kennyman,2007-05-28 19:55:00,737,"That was a beautiful tribute. Very eloquently spoken. I'm really sorry to hear that he has passed and I feel for you Lew. It's not the same, but I lost my closest Aunt who I loved very dearly to cancer last year. She suffered too long. It was terrible to watch it happen, but I was glad to be by her side comforting her and my mother (her best friend) until the very end. It kind of puts things into perspective when things like that happen. It changes you. With me small things that would really annoy me seemed  almost insignificant after. Over time things seem to return to normal and I'm not sure that's a good thing. Thanks for reminding Lew. I really do feel terrible for you. You had a relationship with your brother that I haven't had with mine since we were teenagers. You were a very lucky man to have shared all that you did. From the respect and admiration you recieve here I know he was very lucky to have you as a brother. Peace be with you and your family Lew."

Ed certainly enjoyed his time as a member of OFC and was looking forward to posting many fishing reports from his new home in the Rideau Lakes region.  He was an excellent angler, but was also a very accomplished golfer and enjoyed the game from the time he learned to play as a small child and continued with it his entire life.  This is one of my favorite pictures of Ed and was taken on a southern U.S. golf course a couple years ago.....check out the aligator laying in the water just behind him.  Thanks again everyone.  "

The more I read the posts, there just had to be something more.  Then it hit me .... EddyK and I had exchanged some PM's a little while back when he was moving to Delta.  EddyK was asking about the area and the fishing.  I've stopped by Delta a couple times on my way to Rideau Ferry and we had a few exchanges.  His last PM was to invite me to stop by when I pass through the area this July and say HELLO and I was thinking of doing just that.  Dang (wish there was an emoticon with tears)."

I've always enjoyed Eddy's posts, especially the ones where you and him took a few jabs at each other. I don't have a brother, but to me the definition of brotherly love was spelled out in your posts. The tribute that you paid to Eddy was inspiring, to say the least. I'm sure that he was very, very proud of you.  My deepest sympathies to you and your family Lew."
