To those who flyfish  there was a good Hendrickson and caddis hatch and later in the afternoon a yellow crane was the choice..  Anyway Ken on his second time out,  was casting loops straigh, mending,  and the most importantly  he landed his first Brown Trout on a fly...    so you can say he's not the flyfishing virgin anymore  The final count for Ken was 4 solid stockers in the 8-10 inch range.  2 lost flies and a new love for flyfishing      A GREAT DAYS FISHING WITH A GREAT GUY   WAY TO GO KEN   Dave   P.s  I managed to catch some fish as well,  all in all a great 9 hrs of fishing"
