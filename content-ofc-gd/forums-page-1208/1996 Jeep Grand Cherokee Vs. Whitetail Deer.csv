76803,brandon,2007-05-30 01:21:00,857,lol sorry to dissapoint all you jeep fans out there but its as good as gone.....plates are off it and just waiting to arrange a meeting for the scrap yard guys to pick it up and give me some coin.  Test drove a 2007 civic today....50mpg......whereas the jeep....20ish mpg......and with the price of gas and the amount of driving I do I'll sacrifice having to drive a car (which I would much rather an SUV or a truck) to save a bit of money while i get on my feet with this new job and move to Orillia.

76896,Mattitude,2007-05-30 07:32:00,155,My old car (03 Jetta 1.8t) is for sale at Orillia Volkswagen.  I've only hit frogs on rainy nights accidently with it.
76902,Carp,2007-05-30 08:50:00,1488,"Glad you're O.K. Brandon. Damage doesn't look too bad.   I've see many deer near the edge of highways in the last couple of weeks. As already mentioned, I think the bugs are driving them out of the bush. Saw 2 live and 2 dead (hit by cars) in a short stretch of the 401 the other day. That was just on my side of the hwy. Today will be hot and humid. I suspect I'll be seeing more of them."
76903,motv8tr,2007-05-30 09:18:00,2587,"Too bad about the jeep, if I had the money I'd take it off your hands myself and get it fixed...you gotta do what's right for you...but I bet you'll miss it...  Maureen"
76644,fishnsled,2007-05-29 20:08:00,3520,"Certainly glad to see that you are alright.  As for the Jeep, a trip to the wreckers for a few parts, a new rad and some red/green special adhesive and your good to go.  Been there, done that!  lol"
76797,Loonietoon,2007-05-30 01:14:00,1450,Brandon it's a Jeep you can't kill it... Like everyone said.. fix the rad another light and you are set to go... give the truck some carictur   (spelling).. Jeep Tough
