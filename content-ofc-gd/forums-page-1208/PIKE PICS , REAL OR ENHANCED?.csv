76687,gussser,2007-05-29 21:47:00,85,"I personally caught them both.  Used fly rod with 1 lb tippet.   Gee I wonder why everyone else is claiming my fish??? Both were caught in local stream during trout season making them OOS, so I released them asap. THAT means as soon as pictures.    Really, You can believe me. I always tell the truth."
76076,HAGAN,2007-05-28 14:34:00,6,"My fishing buddy is telling me a story I think. you judge . On the week of May 12,13 he said he got these photos of his buddy fishing ,lake Nippising First of all I believe Pike were not open yet ,and wouldn,t it be a world record or at least a ontario, record. "

76081,Terry,2007-05-28 14:38:00,14456,"lair lair, pants on fire   unless I'm wrong..( and I was wrong once back in 72) that picture has been around for some time and was caught over seas where they grown them big and it cost tons of money to fish on many  of the lakes"
76082,MJL,2007-05-28 14:40:00,2427,Most reports I've seen with that pic said the fish was caught somewhere in Italy.
76083,RobHall,2007-05-28 14:40:00,261,He's pulling your leg.  That was caught in Europe somewhere.  It's been posted before.   FOTB

76090,bigfish1965,2007-05-28 14:52:00,3382,"The pike was caught in the Netherlands. Been all over the internet for about 2 years now. The sturgeon was definitely caught at Lake Nipissing. It stayed for a few beers, told some inappropriate jokes and was asked to leave. Never saw it again."
76094,bassmastermike,2007-05-28 15:03:00,295,Yeah Right Take a look how small his fishing rod is !! That fish would have snapped it in half LOL Nice try tho<<
76095,Joey,2007-05-28 15:03:00,9122,"Gawd, we should have a pinned section for Bull pictures and stuff.  How many times has that story been around   and posted here!!  Good one Rick, you should become a comedian or something  Joey"
76204,PAZE,2007-05-28 18:38:00,132," I heard of a guy who caught a 65 lbs musky on walleye gear and anouther guy who caught one that was 61 lbs on walleye gear aswell, that rod is more then enough to land that fish. ( not that I would use gear like that LOL)"
76208,PatrickGG,2007-05-28 18:51:00,562,OMG! this is becoming the monthly topic.
76209,Joey,2007-05-28 18:51:00,9122,"Its not the size of a man's rod, its how he uses it  Joey"
76213,misfish,2007-05-28 19:00:00,29133,Thats my uncle from NFLD. We were fishing for perch one day on Simcoe and he was one lucky dude to land that brute on 2 pound floro. True story.

76256,Wes Bender,2007-05-28 20:52:00,105,"Both, the pike and the sturgeon were caught in Rainy Lake. But judgeing on how many different place this fish has been claimed to have been caught, I may also be wrong. I recieve both of those photos in email. the pike about 2 years ago. I think it was a friends, cousin who caught it. Or a cousins friend, who really knows. And the sturgeon I recieved last year. Same story. So now the question is... WHERE? hmmm"
76262,Wes Bender,2007-05-28 20:56:00,105,hmmmm a though just came to mind. This is how I can protect my secret spots without being labled a basshole for not giving up information. Just tell 2 people a different spot and let the internet do the rest.. hahaha  The people who caught those monsters are fricken genious.
76267,fishboy,2007-05-28 21:07:00,550," through the ice with a 4"" hole"
76300,irishfield,2007-05-28 22:55:00,26272,Big Pike was not caught in Rainy Lake....it's from the Netherlands. Picture is also in the in-fisherman or esox angler mag for their article about fishing there.  The other one of the pike eatin the pike has been around for MANY years.  As for the Sturgeon....that's the biggest piece of tail I've ever had my hands on.....
76304,Joey,2007-05-28 23:02:00,9122," Yes, I know Tom, is was intended that way    silly  Joey"
76309,Marty,2007-05-28 23:18:00,873,Esox Angler did a great story on that pike.  Ain't from North America.
76359,fishindevil,2007-05-29 01:34:00,6254,"Yes its for sure scam,well it worked he got you real good,you acually believed him.  ..lol..lol but it sure would have been nice to catch that huge pike man,what a fight it must have put up.....thanks for sharing    cheers"
