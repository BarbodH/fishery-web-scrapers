I am mainly a bass and pike fisherman but love the muskie.  My fav lake is Baptiste up near Bancroft.  Spinning and top water is my fav way to fish.  I have used this site for probably 6 years as a learning tool reading more than posting.  Once again im looking for help. Im heading to lake manitouwabing in a few weeks and am in need of a fishing map.  If anyone could send me one or knows a good site that would be great.  Thanks in advance and if anyone is heading to Baptiste ill be more than happy to set you off in the right direction
