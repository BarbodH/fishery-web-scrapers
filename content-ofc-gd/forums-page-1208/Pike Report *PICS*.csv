Over the day I landed 4 pike and a whole bunch of OOS smallies.  2 pike came on a saltwater X-Rap, the other 2 on a 6"" pink senko.  The X-Rap was worked with a twitch pause twitch pause retrieve along dropoffs and over the very few weedbeds we found.  The senko was twitched back to the boat as fast as I could twitch and retrieve for a reaction bite on topwater!!  My biggest, a 36 incher came on the senko.   Check out the gash in this fishes tail!!!  Bigger fish lurking ?? I think so.   the fish was hooked in the lip but bled quite a bit, swam away quickly enough, getting me a little bit wet.   Buddy with a 42 incher, hooked deep on a beleiver, but swam away fine.  All in all, a good day out!"
