76738,ilario,2007-05-29 23:44:00,166,Hey there:  What might be the approximate weight difference between an aluminum boat and an equivalent size fiberglass?   e.g. a 14' aluminum utlity boat is roughly 200-225lb. Would the fiberglass weigh twice as much?    thanks
76819,Fisherman,2007-05-30 01:53:00,7201,"We just transported a couple of Lowe 1462 models, 180 lbs each, I would think you are right about double the weight."
76926,ilario,2007-05-30 11:50:00,166,"  So on average, they're about twice as heavy?"
76930,irishfield,2007-05-30 11:56:00,26272,"All depends who did the glass work. You can give 100 guys the parts to build in alum and it will always be the same weight. Fiberglass built by historic (chop gun) you'll have a 100 different boat weights in Glass. Someone doing it right by the infusion process (that not many, if any, boat builders use) it will be close each time. With smaller stuff even by that process, to get a minimum workable thickness, it will still weight at least 60 to 70 % more than alum. Once you get into bigger stuff it can be made comparable in weight to alum."
77008,POLLIWOGG,2007-05-30 14:13:00,835,Age of the boat will make a difference as new glass boats are built a lot lighter than old ones.
77129,Fish Farmer,2007-05-30 19:15:00,2234,"It's Actually a myth. very little difference. I've had both. Glass seems to stand up better when pounding the big water, and a little quieter. Some glass boats are built better than others, goes for aluminum also. It's what you pay for. If I had to do it over, I'd go for a HarberCraft or Stanley boat. But your going to pay. They will be the last one you'll have to buy. Unless you get 2 foot iteis."
77157,aplumma,2007-05-30 20:04:00,6896,I will stick to Aluminum for all of my boats. The 28 ft Marinette is aluminum and it weighs in at 7200 lbs were a 28 ft four Winn's fiberglass is 9800 lbs the kicker is the Marinette has twin 318's and the four winns has the single volvo setup. The aluminum does not become porous over time and survives impacts with debris in the river better. Being lighter also makes for better fuel economy and less maintenance on the bottom painting.   Art
