76022,bassman,2007-05-28 12:50:00,384,"Just got back yesterday from our annual fishing trip. This year we decided to change it up and stayed at the Comeau Chalet at West Nipissing Resort, based on the research I did both on the internet and on this site.  I have to say this was by far the best fishing trip that we have had to date. The chalet was incredible, with all the amenities of home. Beautiful screened in porch, deck, private dock, great fishing boat, games room, etc. etc.  The fishing on Thursday and Friday was very limited, as there were very high winds that limited our access to the lake, however, we did manage to pull out a few small pike.  The majority of fishing was done on Saturday. We had a nice haul of pike, catfish, 1 OOS incidental SM Bass, and my first Freshwater Drum.  If you're looking for a great spot for your fishing trip, or for the family, I highly recommend West Nipissing Resort.  Ian, who is the owner of the resort, lived up to his reputation as a wonderful host. He will definately be seeing my business for years to come.  Thanks to all the OFNers that provided me with the tips and info for Nipissing.  I will be posting a few pictures shortly.  Cheers  "
