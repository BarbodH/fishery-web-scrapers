77226,snagmaster,2007-05-30 22:15:00,250,Hey guys was so anticipating this june weather so that i could get out on the water and target some walleye....Have time off work but i find myself trying to keep busy at home instead of out on the water where i should be.....Whats with everyone working so much these days....lol. The girlfriend isnt to excited about me going on the water alone so it looks like i will be stuck at home on another beauty day tomorrow. If anyone wantes to pair up and chace some eyes tomorrow let me know....PM me or respond on this post By the way i have a boat and looking to either hit the kawarthas or if i can find someone hardcore  Quinte    Went out this week to scugog for three hours with woodro and caught to eater size walleye....they were both released... goodluck on the water
