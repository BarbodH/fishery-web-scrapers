I have heard that St. Lawrence is great for Muskie but unfortunately after looking online I donâ€™t think Muskie season opens there until June 15.  The MNRF website does say that Pike and Walleye are open all year round on the St. Lawrence though.  Do any of you know if the Quebec City area of the St. Lawrence holds good numbers of pike and walleye?  Thanks
77064,Roy,2007-05-30 16:47:00,13728,The Quebec City area is mostly brook trout territory. Pike and walleye are not open all year on the St Lawrence. For a reasonable shot at pike and walleye on the Larry you'll need to come back West about an hour.  Have a good trip.
