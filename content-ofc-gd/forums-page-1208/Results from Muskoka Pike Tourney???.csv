75649,bucktail,2007-05-27 14:33:00,1857,Does anyone know how the Muskoka pike Tourney went down yesterday. I really should have entered it but had other commitments.
75653,musky66,2007-05-27 15:00:00,273,I have been in it several times in the past- I have done fairly well some years and poorly others. It seems the same few guys win it every year or place very high- they obviously know the lake very well! No time for it this year- I will be interested to know the results as well. Bet it was won by someone from Muskoka bassmasters!

75841,Rizzo,2007-05-28 00:42:00,4754,"I've fished the lake a few times before, but with my fish averaging slightly better than hammerhandle (25-27 inches), and my boat a puny 14 feet, I haven't bothered to enter.  I think the guy's name who pretty much is a shoe-in to win most years is Dave Rochette."
