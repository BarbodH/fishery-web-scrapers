It's a big let down for me personally, but hey life goes on. Nobody ever got anywhere without trying, and I can honestly say I tried my best. The project is not completely dead yet, but I'm going to refrain from making anymore statements or predictions until a deal is signed sealed and delivered. Ah well, it's off to the cabin again this weekend to dig another hole and drown my sorrows in some more walleye!"
76318,Gerritt,2007-05-28 23:39:00,6129,Dude..... that sucks.  Gerritt.
76322,Muskieman,2007-05-28 23:47:00,2472,"Sorry to hear it man!   thats a bummer Eh? i'm sure you can get back on yer feet and try it in anotherway. We need another show especially one that focuses on the North. I tried once but they said i was too young then 16.. but they accepted my plan on paper . and when it came time for funding and air time, i was shot down. They were producing another fishin' show that same season, called Fishin the North with Don M**k. He  worked for MCTV at the time.   Good Luck with your endeavours I'm sure you'll find a way. try you-tube. Muskieman."
76323,Roy,2007-05-28 23:49:00,13728," You said a mouthful there, Solo. When you do make a go of it, you'll look back and even appreciate these little setbacks. Be comfortable in knowing that what you've accomplished so far is top notch. Be well."
76354,Dano,2007-05-29 01:31:00,719,"Yea, sorry to hear that, I was looking forward to it. Is there any way we can still see it? What about marketing it yourself."
76543,Paulus,2007-05-29 15:33:00,522,"Sorry to hear it, Mike. I hope things turn around, because I think there's lots of interest in it - if OFC reaction is any clue at all (which I think it is).  If it's any consolation, not that I know any of the particulars but..., lots of very successful shows had a rocky road at the start. Seinfeld did not have a smooth start, for example, and almost didn't air  ; and Survivor didn't even start in the US: it was swedish! And J.R.R. Tolkien's The Hobbit  might never have been published, if it wasn't that the publisher's son read it & liked it. So the path to success is often riddled with defeats, and it sometimes takes a long, long time to get recognized.  Don't lose hope!  p.-"
76545,ccmtcanada,2007-05-29 15:36:00,7971,"Awww Mike...I'm really sorry to hear this news!  When I first started reading your posts, I remember feeling like I was there...the story...the photographs kept me interested!  When you mentioned a possible TV show, I was pretty excited.  Even though it's on hold, you have lots of support here on OFC...have the execs hang out here for a while...maybe they'll change their minds!  In the meantime, just keep doing what you love to do!"
76548,lunkerbasshunter,2007-05-29 15:50:00,2585,"hey man,  Dont worry to much about it!  Set backs are part of every business and obviously the outdoors business has the same issues. Keep at it dont give up!  Im sure things will work out.  You have a chance to do something you love.  keep trying!  All the best!  Cheers!"
76553,tonyb,2007-05-29 16:12:00,1637,"That sucks...  What happened, did the CRTC not approve the pilot? or were you not quite at that stage yet?  Tony"
76554,solopaddler,2007-05-29 16:13:00,8605,"Thanks everyone. I've got to admit for a while there I felt gut-shot. The dream had nothing to do with gaining any notoriety and everthing to do with making a better life for my family......and the fact is there's plenty of other ways to do that. It's certainly not the end of the world, and in the grand scheme of things really is small potatos compared to a real issue like Lew and his family are going through."
76577,Nemo,2007-05-29 17:12:00,727,Well said. Just get that footage up on youtube or your website. I bet that would generate some buzz....Chin up
76661,aniceguy,2007-05-29 20:44:00,1094,sorry to hear about it Mike.  I know you were stoked over it when we talked last time on the river.  If there is anyone out there to get a show like that off its certainly you.  Mike soon its time for the green fish lol make some time to fish the local waters
