Not wanting to go home skunked, we hit up a smaller local lake in search of some pike.  Hammerhandles, I believe are the exact word to describe them haha.  We hit the windblown shoreline and started throwing spinnerbaits and rattletraps.  Water was 67 degrees, 18 degrees warmer than Simcoe, and the aggressiveness of the fish showed.  We were landing fish every 5 minutes.  Over and over and over again, whack whack whack!!  Colour didnt matter, size didnt matter, the fish ate them!  Unfortunately, no size today!!   first monster of the day!   Kelli with Moby dick   Another anaconda!!   I cant even take this seriously haha   Wooo LOL   Better fish, but still a dink.  So that was my day today ... look for more reports come the weekend.  Anyone wants to chat, I work 5am - 2pm at bass pro every weekday, stop in.  Take care and good fishin!"
