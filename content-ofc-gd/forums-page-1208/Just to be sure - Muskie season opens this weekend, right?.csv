76599,lunkerbasshunter,2007-05-29 18:06:00,2585,i think it depends on where you are going to be fishing. try the mnr website.  You can download a copy for any area in ontario.  cheers!
76602,kelvarnson,2007-05-29 18:16:00,15,Sorry I should have been clearer.  I'm heading to Rice Lake (District 6) for walleye and was pretty sure it opened there on the first Saturday in June.  MNR website only has 2006 regs posted.  Thanks again.
76605,tonyb,2007-05-29 18:19:00,1637,You are to follow the 2005-06 regulations as per the MNR website...sounds like you already looked it up.  Tony
