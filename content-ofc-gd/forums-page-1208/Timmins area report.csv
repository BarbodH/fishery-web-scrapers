We left on Saturday morning of the long weekend at 5 AM and headed for a small inland lake just outside of Timmins, this is the farthest North I have ever been and the country side was beautiful. We arrived at around 3 PM and it had started raining at 2:30 so we had to set up camp in the rain, we were soaked by the time we were done. We awoke Sunday morning to a blanket of snow on the ground,Kinda caught me by surprise. We had brought two 14 foot tinnies and my bow rider and the ramp was a bit small but we managed to get them all in the water.    The fishing was pretty good a lot of average pike from hammer handles to 4-5 pounds and the odd pickerel mixed in. We did manage a nice close up of last years young moose and we seen a Bald Eagle every day.    By Wednesday the weather turned around and got hot, Thursday we reached 33 degrees C. I knew this could slow the fishing and it did a bit but we still caught fish. To my delight on our last day I caught my personal best pickerel at 27 and3/4 inches and 5 pounds. I know if I fish Lake Erie much this year I will probably get bigger but from a lake that far North and maybe a hundred acres I was impressed.    I thought this shot looked pretty cool.  On our way back out we seen this little guy again something I had never seen up this close before.  In the end it was a great trip and will be looking forward to the next time we go."

76544,taper,2007-05-29 15:35:00,611,"Don't get me wrong I'm not complaining about the weather, it wasn't that bad at all. The black flies were not an issue nor were the mosquito's only got bit 3 or 4 times all week. I think the breeze kept them away once the temperature rose."
