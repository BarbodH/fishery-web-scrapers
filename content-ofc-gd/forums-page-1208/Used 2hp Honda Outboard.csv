Was pretty impressed with it, so as I'm in the market for a small motor for myself I started searching for one. I ended up finding one, located 31/2 hours away from me. Guy says it's a 2001, runs perfectly, but is a former rental motor that's seen it's share of use, and he's asking $300 for it. Definitely a good price, but I'm a little leery about the high hours and the 7 hours of driving there and back to get it. What do you guys think? If it's otherwise in good shape is the high hours thing as bad with a 4-stroke motor? I just need a kick in the pants one way or the other to decide ."

77194,irishfield,2007-05-30 21:15:00,26272,None of them do...all you can do is take a compression tester with you and $250
77207,solopaddler,2007-05-30 21:44:00,8605," Compression tester is a good idea, I'll have to see if I can scrounge one up..."
77218,danbouck,2007-05-30 22:03:00,4380,Seems like a real good price. Bring a Compression tester for sure.
