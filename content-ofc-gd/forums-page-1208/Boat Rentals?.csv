The Park Hotel has been Burliegh Island Lodge for several years now and, unfortunately, Doug Wilson passed away a few years ago as well. The old coffee shop (open at 7AM) is now a tanning salon/spa.  Stricker's and Trude's are still around.  Some others to try:  Emerald Isle Marina, Upper Buckhorn: 705-292-8452  Old Causeway Marina, Chemong: 705-292-5390  Good Luck!"
