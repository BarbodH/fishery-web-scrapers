We were all pretty pump for a great trip but the fish didn't cooperate for us.  Some beautiful scenery and some great company certainly made up for the lack of fish.  My brother had one laker to the hole and lost it, well I kinda screwed up on the landing job, sorry bro.  I had one tiny ling of about 9 inches and that was all.  Oh well there is always next year.  Enjoy the sights.   Sunrise   We sure ate real good!    Sunset "
76406,fishnsled,2007-05-29 02:59:00,3520,I forgot about this.  At least my brother and I got to test out the new clams.  They were awesome!  
76407,irishfield,2007-05-29 02:59:00,26272,It's never too late to redeem yourself FnS..LOL  Nothing like a Temagami sunset. You've gotta take Dano along with you to fish Temagami...he's a good luck charm!

Some of our best ""adventures"" were poor fishing - we had one guy get skunked over an entire March break once! 9-10 days in camp, went fishing every day except the 2 or 3 we were snowed in.. closest he came to a fish was a brookie he lost at the hole. The atmosphere made the trip."
76606,fishnsled,2007-05-29 18:20:00,3520,"Wayne you are certainly right about the sunsets, just beautiful.  Next year we'll have to bring Dano with us if that is what it takes.  lol  Northhunter - It's amazing how a poor fishing trip can still be an amazing adventure.  Combine great company, good food, great scenery and you'll have the makings for a fantantic trip.  Throw in a fish or two and that is a bonus."
