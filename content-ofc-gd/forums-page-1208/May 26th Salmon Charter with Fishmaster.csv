76101,ishingchippy,2007-05-28 15:09:00,33,Well what an amazing day!!!  Thank you sooo much fishmaster for my first try at Salmon fishing.  None of us will ever forget it.  And let me just confirm what everyone always says.  This man is just awesome at what he does.  I swear he didn't stop all day!!  Heck I even packed enough lunch for him and his first mate and they didn't even stop to eat for crying out loud.  LOL and no it wasn't my cooking haha coldcuts  Just wanted to share some pics and smiles of our day.              Oh and what day of my fishing would be complete without..........    LOL......seeing how I have now developed a reputation for running around and kissing fish hahahaha
