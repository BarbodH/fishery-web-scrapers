77126,RobHall,2007-05-30 19:10:00,261,Great report and excellent pics.  Thanks for sharing.      I'd like to do a fly-in someday.  FOTB 
77154,Puckhead,2007-05-30 20:02:00,377,Beauty report!  Always dreamed of a fly in... one day!  On my way over to #2
76696,Whopper,2007-05-29 22:09:00,2174,"Left on Friday the 18th and drove north to the Red Lake area in search of monster pike and some walleye for the table. Hooked up with a few other board members that I haven't met before and wasn't disappointed, great folks! Arrived at the pick up point at Saturday at about 10 am  Pilot, plane and the owner of the camp were waiting, it was my first time flying in a twin engine float plane.  Holy crap what the hell is this stuff, drove through snow flurries from Vermillion Bay to Balmertown and yes it was cold.  Up and away just a short 15-20 minute flight out  Safe landing  Got unloaded and hit the cabin to unpack and do some fishing. Ran in to our neighbors for the week. Great people these two and I don't personally know another women that would have fished in the conditions we fished in all week, hat's off to you Sandy (graftongirl). I can say this now because I'm out of Adams (reefhawg) reach, but he really needs to make her permanent     Hope I don't offend any of the other female members.  A eagle that we saw more than once during the week  On your mark get set ....  We have lift off  Sees something  Fly by pick up, witness this more than once during the week  This is what I call dinning out  My guide for the week, to those of you that might not know this gentleman,  Connie Inman(TennesseeGuy), class act all the way and he can flat get in done, if it wasn't for him and JP Bushey (lipdip) I don't know if I would have made this trip. Thanks to both of you. Oh and by the way this is the type of guy Connie is, we were getting ready to eat one night the buzz around camp was that there was two people from another party that had not returned and it was almost dark with dense fog on the lake. Connie had a nice depth finder with GPS and did not hesitate to get up and go looking for them. Now visibility was less than 50 yards and he returned in just under an hour with the stranded fisherman, they were turned around and headed the wrong direction when he found them and brought them back safely, two happy campers that's for sure.  The other two guys in our group, great people also!  Ahhhhh dinner for four  Dinner is served  The weather wasn't very good all week, snowed the first day and the last day and rained everyday in between but we still caught fish and ate walleyes all week. The worst thing was the multiple fronts and the wind was brutal. Part two to follow!  Whopper"
