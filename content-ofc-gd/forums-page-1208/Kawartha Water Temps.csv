76947,Entropy,2007-05-30 12:31:00,747,"Scugog is 23 - 24 deg C.  Went swiming Monday, it was very nice."
76955,Raf,2007-05-30 12:37:00,3495," Thank you.  Wow, wasn't expecting that with the cold nights.  Heated up fast!!  I am guessing the weeds are very much underway."
76964,fisherguy,2007-05-30 12:54:00,21,Upper Pigeon was 68-71*F yesterday. (surface temp) Weeds are setting up normal for this time of year.
76979,Entropy,2007-05-30 13:15:00,747," They are growing, but the lake is still 'passable', lol."
76993,mattyk,2007-05-30 13:38:00,2110,are you planning for the muskie opener?
76995,Raf,2007-05-30 13:40:00,3495,what's a muskie?  thanks fisherguy.
77026,tipupesox,2007-05-30 15:03:00,167,Sturgeon was up to 68 on Saturday and down to 66 on Sunday after the rain.  Weeds were looking pretty healthy .....
77031,Zamboni,2007-05-30 15:15:00,235," Thats good news for me-running a jet boat I often need to go in to clear weeds from intake on the bog-sure limits my fishing  We'll be out on Scugog Saturday, late Sunday also....os bass were a problem that limited our walleye fishing last week, hope high water temps has moved bass spawn along and got them away from my spot for eyes. Hot enough this week to get those bass in the mood?"
77204,BabyHerc,2007-05-30 21:32:00,285,"With water temps at high 60s to low 70s, those bass should be up on beds finally and away from the pike and walleye holes."
