76558,ishingchippy,2007-05-29 16:30:00,33,"Ok I think I need a little help here.  Apparently Markham has tons of carp and trout.....I however, after at least 15 trips out locally over the last month or so  have found NONE.  My kids are gone for the night so I'd like to head out and just fish.  I also would like to actually catch something.  I really don't care what.  Hell some sunfish would make me happy today.  Anyways does anyone have any ideas??  Place to go??  Shore fishing as I have no boat and would like to drive as little as possible or I'd make the trek to Simcoe.  Any help would be great.  Thanks in advance"

76571,ADC,2007-05-29 16:58:00,82,"***If you can make it to Centre Island, I would check it out. You would have to take the ferry over though $5.  There are Pike gallore in there.  The best spot is in front of the Restaurant closest to the boat rentals where the kiddy rides are. You should see a small set of rafters right in front of the water close to the small bridge/fountain. Fish right in front of the rafters and you will get lots of hits. You can even rent a small peddle boat (kinda pricey though) and get out into the middle.  ***If you want Carp/Pike, you can go to the Ontario Place Theatre and fish right in front/sides (until security kicks you out) and along the water. You will find your way .  ***You can try the Humber River/Stream right below the Old Mill Subway Station at Bloor/Old Mill. But, you would want to either fly fish, use worms or jig's cause lures arent the best but can be used.  ***There is also ParkLawn Park @ Park Lawn & Lakeshore. Just look for the rock beds on the West Side Park and you will see fish as big as Dolphins jumping.    PS - Can I get a PM too for the Carp Adventure?  Good Luck"

76639,lunkerbasshunter,2007-05-29 19:53:00,2585,"sorry i could get you into some fish on the west side of the gta (oakville, burlington area) but not the markham area.  hope you get into some!  Cheers!"
76688,John Bacon,2007-05-29 21:51:00,3277,"I have seen Largemouth and sunfish caught out of Toogood pond.  I believe that there are carp in there as well.  In understand that the Milne Resvoir is also contains carp and largemouth, I haven't fished it myself.  Most of Markham's trout are migratory and are now back in Lake Ontario."
76920,ishingchippy,2007-05-30 11:26:00,33,"Thanks you so much everyone for all your ideas, I just wish I was able to use them last night.  I didn't even get out fishing at all  Oh well sometimes life just does not allow us to do the things we want.  Either way the kids and I are most likely doing some shore fishing at Lake Simcoe this weekend.  So there ya go"
