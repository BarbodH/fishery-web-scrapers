I tried to clean it off and hook it up to the charger but it seems to be shorting out after 5-10 seconds on charger, does that make sense to anyone?  Any help appreciated."
76179,misfish,2007-05-28 17:42:00,29133,"What do you mean,like it,s shutting down (the charger)? This maybe caused by a bad cell. I had one this year and it did the same thing. It would start to charge then it quit and gave me an error reading that I had a bad cell.  Check the caps while your at it to. If you see lots of black,you have over cooked your battery.  Hope this helps."
76181,swahrer,2007-05-28 17:50:00,28,"It actually seemed like more of a trip.  When I put it away last fall, I charged it, so I thought it would still have some charge in it.  So when I connect it the meter starts to rise up will stay for a bit then you hear it spark and it dops back down to 0%.  The charger seems to be still running.  I hooked up the trolling motor to the battery and it would not even spin a bit.  ??"
76211,misfish,2007-05-28 18:55:00,29133,"Battery is pouched sir. I charged mine aswell before putting it away and I got the same thing.  I even put it through a cycle where my charger will send pusating charges through the battery to remove any build up on the cores,that didnt even help.  If your lucky your only running a 12 volt motor,if not,well I would suggest buying two new ones,not just one new and have an old one joined to it."

76316,Muskieman,2007-05-28 23:35:00,2472,you need a new battery man!  here's one   exide # 27dp700  or 24dp625 you should be able to purchase them for about 89.00$ for the 27 and about 74.00$ for the 24. dp means dual purpose i reccomend this one. lotsa cranking amps to start an engine and a great reserve capacity. for your electronics and trolling motors. i know i sell 'em everyday and use 2 myself.   Good Luck! 
76511,swahrer,2007-05-29 14:25:00,28,"Thanks guys, much appreciated as usual.  Exide it is!"
76542,taper,2007-05-29 15:31:00,611,I hate do argue but I wouldn't put an Exide in on a bet. Spend a little extra and get an Interstate. Exide had one of the worst warranty return rates in the business a few years ago.
76801,Loonietoon,2007-05-30 01:18:00,1450,"All as I run is Interstate... Great warranty... in the Truck also.. and wifes car.. in my last boat Interstate lasted 9 years no problem for cranking 7 years for dry cell for the trolling motor , lights and everything else.. spend a little extra"
