I have sent emails to the no reply adress to no avail and I cant even log onto the site to send an admin or the owner an email requesting my removal from thier mass email adress  If someone is familiar with the site that other site could they please instruct them to remove me from the mass email lists or PM/ post how I can get off the list  thanks"
