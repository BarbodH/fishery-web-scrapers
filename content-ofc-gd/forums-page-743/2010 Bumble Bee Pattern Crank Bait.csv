420610,Leecher,2010-01-10 04:15:00,7832,"All week temps were around -6C to -8C with moderate wind.....  perfect for ice fishing, but comes weekend and temps dip -18C with 25Km North / West wind, windchill -25C    no way I'm going out fishing so I decided to tackle another wooden project in the comfort of my home in 20C temp  Had some left overs from 2009    that I did not want go to waste, so rattling crank baits was on the menu and as always wanted to create a unique color pattern that no one ever seen before..... so off I go on the band saw and get busy...  After cutting the outline did not have enough width to make to pieces round so I glued some additional cutout pieces and here's the result    Another shot    Here's a closer look after sanding      That right there got me an immediate reaction of what I wanted to do with the pattern..... applied a coat of white    Then like I said above, got busy on the pattern.... first applied yellow on the big round eyes from the added pieces    Used a permanent marker to draw around the eyes so that I can apply the black coat    Applied the black    Removed the tape off the ends    And finally here's the end results.... Bumble bee crank bait    Hope you enjoy Leechman"

420640,Fishnwire,2010-01-10 13:15:00,983,My dad is a beekeeper.  Is there any chance you'd sell me one of those so I can give him one.  He'd get a real kick out of that.
420642,solopaddler,2010-01-10 13:21:00,8605,Nice work!
420644,Radnine,2010-01-10 13:32:00,1538,I even love the French language newspaper underneath. I am a multi-cultural nut. My Canada includes Leechman!! These lures are fantastic as always Jacques! I love to see a guy with a constructive hobby. Thanks for the post ans keep them coming. Jim
420655,Greencoachdog,2010-01-10 13:49:00,8163,OMG! OMG!... the Killer Bee's are swarming!!!  Very cool paint job on those lures Jacques!!!  I'm thinking those are going to catch some very nice Bass and Pike this year!!!
420663,bushart,2010-01-10 14:10:00,2628,Hey Leechman looks good  Do you varnish those after painting?--Just wondering how they hold up with the acrylic paint under water?  How bout this for a one time idea----maybe you can carve an indentation into a side and glue some of that reflective tape that comes in so many kinds?  Probably only need to indent the thickness of tape--to make it all streamline.  Looks good  Bushart
420674,splashhopper,2010-01-10 14:48:00,2931,"Great Bumblebeee....... Leechman  I wonder if you can make a ""TOP WATER"" butterfly....   Then come up with a ""rippin rap"" song like Mohammed Ali that you can sing with your lures on the days the fishing is slow."
420696,Leecher,2010-01-10 16:05:00,7832," Thanks Dozer!!!   Thanks Fishnwire!!!  No problems, send me via pm your coordinates.   Thanks Mike!!!   Thanks Jim!!!"
420699,Leecher,2010-01-10 16:16:00,7832, Thanks Glen!!!  I like to color pattern on those and I'm thinking the same   Thanks bushart!!!  I forgot to mention in the report that I will be applying 2 coats of varnish to them     Good idea about the reflective tape I have a couple of strips in my tackle box.  That tape really stick good to any surface and it's so thin that 2 coats of varnish is all that's needed.   Thanks splashhopper!!!
