I am watching fishing videos on youtube at 11:30 pm ... planning on fishing up in Haliburton this weekend  thought some of you guys might enjoy this one:  fishing on top of clear ice like this must be amazing, looks like you're sitting on top of an aquarium   "
419909,richyb,2010-01-08 04:41:00,774,Thats why I love fishing in my hut with a 5'x2' hole at my feet. Can start to see the simcoe lakers and whities coming up from 30 ft down.

I had a day out at BBP a few years back when there was about 6"" of ice like that, and saw the whitefish coming up from way down. Soooooo cool."
420055,Jds63,2010-01-08 18:20:00,1365, Simon .... you are up in God's country .... oh how I envy you .... access to all those lakes !!!!!! and hardly anyone around
420061,TJQ,2010-01-08 18:29:00,7806,Thats pretty neat stuff.
420203,StoneFly,2010-01-09 00:04:00,574,That was pretty cool.  Did I hear them say that they were going to intentionally break the last one off becasue they had already kept their legal limit?  That Kinda ruined it for me.
