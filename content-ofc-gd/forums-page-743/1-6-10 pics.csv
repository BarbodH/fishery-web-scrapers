419602,troutologist,2010-01-07 15:44:00,951,"You guys missed the snow it seems...talking to my family in VA they have been having a hard time after those storms a few weeks ago.   Keep it up GCD, looks like that suit will be put to good use. Of course you could always bring a little sour mash along and fish in a t shirt."
419623,ehg,2010-01-07 17:26:00,2666,Nice fish under pretty tough weather for that area  Looks like it is snowing in northern half of Alabama from this latest radar.  http://www.intellicast.com/National/Radar/...cation=USGA0132

419750,Greencoachdog,2010-01-08 00:14:00,8163," I tried that once, and that's how I found out I was a Redneck... You might be a Redneck if you've ever been too drunk to fish!    We got some flurries today, but it was just a smattering... not even any acumulation.    I've been wondering where you've been and been worried sick about you!!!.. you can't call???  I'm absatively posalutely certain that's a Blue Cat!!!    HA!... you just like to see me freezin' my butt off!!!    She says the sweetest things eh!    That's the same thing my wife said!!!"
419947,cram,2010-01-08 05:47:00,1733,That's a really nice fish.   Really nice.  btw - love the float suit.

419368,Greencoachdog,2010-01-07 00:37:00,8163,"Got on the water at 11:00 am and fished til 3:00 pm.  Caught 3 blue cats and no Crappie!:mad:  One of the cats was about 6 oz., another was about 1 1/2 lbs, and I got this 7 lb.-8 oz nice'un! All caught on Tuffie minnows while I was tryin' for Crappie.    I don't usually keep them this big, but I was fish hungry and invited it home for supper!  The water temp was 39*F and the Shad were hugging the bottom, there was evidence of winter kill but not nearly as bad as last year. The birds and some of the fish were still feeding.    I think last winters kill got most of the weak ones. We need some warm days!!!  Tried out the new Arctic Armor floatation suit and man is that thing ever nice!!! Light, very warm, and comfortable!!! The temps today were in the 30'*F and that was a heat wavel compared to the last 9 days! They're calling for snow tomorrow and then more freezin' temps 'til the end of next week!  I hold each and every one of you Canadians responsible for this... you will pay!!!"
