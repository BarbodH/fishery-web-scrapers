420105,Terry,2010-01-08 19:48:00,14456,what does he want to fish for
420108,charlied,2010-01-08 19:51:00,584,"more than likely perch, as laker and whitey fishing can be few and far between."
420112,Terry,2010-01-08 19:56:00,14456,I like the huts in the beaverton area for perch these two are great and they are not related to each other  http://www.timhalesfishhuts.com/  http://www.floydhalesfishhuts.com/default.html
420114,charlied,2010-01-08 20:00:00,584,"thanks a bunch, hope the fishing is good on that area."
420120,Terry,2010-01-08 20:06:00,14456,they are pretty good and they move their huts if the fish move
420271,eyefish,2010-01-09 02:54:00,135,I was out with floyd today and all I can say is don't waste your time..there from 8 till 4 and only caught 5 fish..everyone in the huts caught less than ten...for 50 bucks wait till he moves his huts a bit deeper
420306,Sinker,2010-01-09 04:57:00,8692,"Try Caseys in port bolster. You get lucky there and hook into the odd whitey sometimes too. Great operation, they have everything you need there, and Leona is the nicest ladie on the lake!!!   S."
