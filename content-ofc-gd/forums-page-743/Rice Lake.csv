Was marking a couple but no takers.  Moved spots in 5 feet of water and we had better luck.  # nice crappie right off bottom and 6 gills.  All in all, a nice experience ice fishing outside the cottage for the first time ever.  Oh ya, all fish caught on a tear drop tipped with a minnow head.  Good luck everyone and be safe."
