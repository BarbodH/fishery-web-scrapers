People who still believe that the more you give, the more you truly receive.  It is to people like yourselves described above that I struggle to find all the appropriate words to express our extreme gratitude for all you have to done to honor my late husband Sonny’s memory.  Please know that your kindness and caring play such a big part. A thousand thank you’s doesn’t even begin to express our gratitude during this difficult time. You all have touched our lives and Domenic, Emma, and myself sincerely thank you all for your generous gift.  Every tear is a prism through which I see, A rainbow of emotions and memories, Though fate has led you to another place, True moments hold meaning time can never erase.  Sincerely,    Jen, Domenic and Emma Amalfi"
