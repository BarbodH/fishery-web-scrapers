419821,redneck666,2010-01-08 02:24:00,563,"dont mean to annoy with my constant bay topics, lol. But i just want a little reassurance on one thing, im a 230lb guy and am looking to take my citation 377 out to leigh's bay for some ice fishing early saturday morning. would it be safe to drive the old sled out onto the ice or should i park it on shore and haul my gear to the desired location? and do i have to be choosy with my spot or are them there whities all over the bay?  i should have added this for the  none local guys willing to help: ice should be around 7-8"" maybe more...  thanks for any help guys,  JP"
419881,redneck666,2010-01-08 03:55:00,563,Anyone???
419884,irishfield,2010-01-08 03:59:00,26272,I'll do it from here.. if you're not sure.. don't go. Park it and spud or drill out. If you like what you see... sled it.
419887,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2010-01-08 04:03:00,0,"when it doubt, i don't mess with ice.  can't help you and i don't know what kind of currents and such are out that away.  good luck on the water!"
419898,redneck666,2010-01-08 04:19:00,563,"it cant be to bad seeing as how theres huts out on the bay right now. me and my buddy were parked side by side while we were on our snowmobiles last year and we're both BIG guys. we didnt fall through the ice so all was good, besides the fact i wasnt fishing and we watched a few guys pull some nice fish up.  if theres still snow covering my street tomorrow i'll have to take a ride to the bay on my sled"
419953,TDunn,2010-01-08 06:19:00,680,your good...stay on the trail    TDunn
419959,xeon,2010-01-08 06:57:00,350,People usually have sleds on the ice around those parts in Mid-Late December. I'm headed out this morning I'll give you an ice report if I remember.
419985,Dara,2010-01-08 13:14:00,3052,I saw people unloading 4 wheelers there yesterday to head out. I would imagine its ok. Just stay on the trail to you punch your own hole. Fish near the huts...them guys bait the holes
419986,Greencoachdog,2010-01-08 13:29:00,8163,"Whether it's ""safe"" or not, it would be a good idea to wear some type of floatation."
420023,xeon,2010-01-08 16:40:00,350,"10'' of clear ice, your safe. Fishing however will be questionable, the water is at an all time murkeyness. Also leighs bay for a friday morning was extremely popular, hate to see a Saturday."
420025,Toronto_Angler,2010-01-08 16:44:00,698, If you've already mad eup your mind why bother asking?
420088,troutologist,2010-01-08 19:08:00,951,"Honestly, if you were asking for ice conditions in wawa cool, its a drive, but this is literally in town, go check it out and make your own calls.  I know I'd hate to sink a sled cuz someone on the computer said it was safe."
420093,highdrifter,2010-01-08 19:13:00,2534,Duuude.    Tisk tisk..
420100,redneck666,2010-01-08 19:31:00,563," bring your fancy suit on by then, i'll test it for ya"
420104,redneck666,2010-01-08 19:46:00,563," i ""bait"" when i fish too, along the pier i use ""something"" in a little sack, tied to my shoe and then lowered into the water which disperses scent into the water. i noticed it actually puts my catch rate way up!"
420278,xeon,2010-01-09 03:17:00,350,"  Well, what is this secret something? And its something you keep tied to your shoe?"
420424,redneck666,2010-01-09 18:58:00,563," this secret somthing isnt much of a secret, its just a household spice i learned from the internet attracts whitefish. i just tie it to my shoe while im doing stationary fishing cause there isnt anything else to hook it onto.  lets see if you can guess my ""secret"" spice lol"

420439,redneck666,2010-01-09 19:54:00,563," well, i left that for xeon, but uhh..... good enough, lol....... your right by the way!"
