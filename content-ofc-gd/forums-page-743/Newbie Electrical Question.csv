I picked up my first boat this fall after renting a boat for the first time up on the Mazinaw where I caught this bug that's making me spend money on fishing stuff that I haven't the slightest idea how to use     She's a 20 year old 16' aluminum with a 1989 30hp 2 stroke Johnson.  The motor doesn't have an alternator but I want to be able to run the marker lights, a trolling motor (to be purchased) and a fish finder (also to be purchased before the water goes soft).  Is there anything aside from a 12v deep cycle marine battery and a charger that I'll need to be able to connect these components, ie: will the fish finder connect directly to the battery or is there something needed between those, and will one battery be enough or does a trolling motor need it's own battery?  And while I'm asking newbie-like questions any opinions on good entry level trolling motors or fish finders?"
420510,Terry,2010-01-10 00:39:00,14456,"putting the lights on the same battery as the trolling motor is no problem, but some trolling motors cause RF and that can affect electronics so you may want a second battery for fishfinders and G PS, but it will not hurt them so you can give it a try before you buy a second battery and it wouldn't hurt to have a 30 to 50 amp  fusible link at the battery, so if there is a short it will not burn up the battery"
420647,smally21,2010-01-10 13:36:00,993,"you can keep things clean by putting a terminal block in and wiring your electronics from there.  i imagine for a boat that size your trolling motor will be 12V, and a decent deep cycle will run everything for hours.  in line fuses are a must, light guage wiring can burn up in no time with shorts and such. good luck."
420660,canuckjack,2010-01-10 14:06:00,121,"Thanks guys, appreciate the feedback.  Smally you say a decent deep cycle battery, any preference on make?  Was keeping an eye on the Motomaster Nautilus, any experience on here with those?"
