As is so typical when icefishing, 2 holes produced all the action. Son and I were the lucky ones this time. A very light bite on pinners and small salties but still managed enough for dinner.   We still found a lot of spots with very skinny ice. We backed off real quick. Be safe and have the necessary safety gear at the ready."

Got the son's better half out and she was first to catch a fish on her first successful ice outing. She certainly outdid RobD  Mind you, it took us 5 minutes to get Amie to hold the fish in her hand"
