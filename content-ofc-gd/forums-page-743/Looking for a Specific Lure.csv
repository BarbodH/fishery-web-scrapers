420393,Rich Clemens,2010-01-09 17:28:00,3131,"I'll see if anyone can come up with the name or manufacturer of a lure I'm looking for.  My wife had a couple of these and really liked fishing with them.  Unfortunately Pike liked them too and destroyed them both.  I've checked a number of tackle stores (including where we bought them) and also on the Internet - no luck.  They resemble the Shallow Invader by Musky Innovations (in general appearance), but what we had were a little smaller than this  - maybe about 6 inches in length.  Plastic lip, hard body and soft tail.  I also seem to remember they had a wire running down the the outside of the lure as well.  This is the Shallow Invader as a reference/comparison to what I'm looking for.    I'd like to purchase a couple more if I can find them."
420401,ChrisK,2010-01-09 17:44:00,2772,"Rich, Is this close ?? They make one called the squirly tail http://www.eaglesportscenter.com/products/mania/jake.htm"
420402,spoon,2010-01-09 17:48:00,74,"Musky Innovation, Shallow Invader"
420504,Rich Clemens,2010-01-10 00:00:00,3131," Sorry Chris.  I know it was not a Squirrly Tail.  The one on this page is about 13"".   The ones we had were about half that size.  Appreciate the thought and possibility though.   Spoon:  It is smaller than the Shallow Invader - but is very similar in appearance (but a little smaller).  I have a couple of the Shallow Invaders and have had some nice hits on them.  But - just not quite what we're after, but I do appreciate the response."
420546,EE_,2010-01-10 01:48:00,36,http://www.cabelas.com/p-0037358121158a.shtml  There should not be any wire for hard body
420564,steverowbotham,2010-01-10 02:39:00,1800,"that looks like a Shallow Invader to me, I have a few of them"
420574,purekgw,2010-01-10 02:46:00,585,"i found a few that might be  http://store.castaicswimbait.com/Product/1...ead-Quick-Snap/  then i came across this    would want to have a 6"" one"
420646,Rich Clemens,2010-01-10 13:35:00,3131,"Shucks .... still not the one I'm looking for, but much appreciated.   I agree that is was strange that there was a strong wire on the outside (underneath), but there was.  Maybe someday, some where, I'll run across them again.  Spent a hour yesterday searching on-line and nothing.  Could very well be out of production as this was about 3 years ago.   Much appreciate all help and listing possibilities though."
420654,Radnine,2010-01-10 13:48:00,1538, Why don't you ask Leechman to make you one? Jim
