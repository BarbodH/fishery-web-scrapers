We must have drilled 15 or more holes today trying to find the fish. I have tried Big Bay and a second place I think was called Potters Creek or something like that.. Just wondering if anyone can point me in the direction of the fish?  Not asking for you secret spots or anything, just a general idea of which areas you might suggest. I am on foot so cant be too far to walk from shore. Any input would be appreciated, I would be happy to bag some walleye, but would be just fine with some perch. I just wanna fry some fish! Dammit!!"
