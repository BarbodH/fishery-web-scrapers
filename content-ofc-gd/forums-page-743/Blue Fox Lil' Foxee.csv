419680,Eazy,2010-01-07 21:45:00,260,"Picked up afew of these last year but didn't really have a chance to give 'em a whirl, look pretty good tho?........Any fellow anglers out there ever tried these?"
419681,EC1,2010-01-07 21:51:00,930,"I would like to know the answer to that too! I bought a couple of them, but they never saw the ice last week. My initial thoughts to it was that they were going to be decent, but once they came out of the package I noticed one of the hooks were dull to begin with. And after tests in the bathtub, I've come to a conclusion that they should be ok..and I would tip it with a maggot or something.  To be honest though, there's a whole bunch of other stuff I would like to try before that actually will make it onto my line though"
419687,Eazy,2010-01-07 21:59:00,260,  What kind of action did they have???..........Just straight up and down pretty much?
419708,Leecher,2010-01-07 23:15:00,7832,Tried the silver blue for the first time last season and got myself my very first whitie on it..... tipped it with Gulp fish fry in white Great lure for vertical jigging!!! Leechman
419714,EC1,2010-01-07 23:23:00,930,"I would say its close to a 30 degree jig instead of a 45 degree diagonal one. The head always points downwards, until your bait lies completely on the bottom. The feathers give some action, but the rest of the body is hard and looks pretty stiff in the water. When jigged, the tail flutters a little bit and thats about it.  I guess I will try it for about 15 minutes this weekend, and I'll tell you my results with it. It's my first year ice fishing, and my second time this weekend..so I have a ton of baits to try, and find myself a favourite one real quick"
419716,EC1,2010-01-07 23:25:00,930,And thanks leechman for the insight!
419719,Leecher,2010-01-07 23:28:00,7832, Your welcome!!!
419841,DRIFTER_016,2010-01-08 02:54:00,10439,I have a few. They worked well for lakers last year. This year I bought a bunch more and found them in a much larger size. They will get a work out on Saturday.  
420006,anders,2010-01-08 15:40:00,1168,I did well with them for specks once last year when we werent getting any on spoons or minnows...i think the fly looking hook at the end was the trick.  Might look like an emergent coming out of the bottom.

420053,ckrb2007,2010-01-08 18:19:00,449,I use the small version of them for perch. I have used the larger ones for whities. Just trim the feather off and use a micro-tube instead. I much prefer badd boyz and meegs for lake simcoe.
420080,tonyb,2010-01-08 19:01:00,1637,"They work well for Simcoe Lake Trout and Whitefish.  I still tip them with the tube, but pull the feathers back down after pushing a tube up onto the body.  http://www.rapala.ca/products/bluefox/lfjm.php  They are just another flavour of horizontal single-hook baits.
