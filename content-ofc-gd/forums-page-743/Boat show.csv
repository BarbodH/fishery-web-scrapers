419679,Radnine,2010-01-07 21:42:00,1538,"Hi all, Is anyone heading to the boat show this weekend? Don't forget to buy your tickets on line and save $5.00! I think we are going on Saturday the 9th. Jim"
419686,Bernie,2010-01-07 21:56:00,3190,"I'll be there Radnine. Stop by the Crestliner display, I'll be hanging out there for the weekend."
419689,lew,2010-01-07 22:03:00,12766,"I'll be heading down too, probably Monday.  Don't need anything but it's always nice to look at the new stuff."
419691,Roy,2010-01-07 22:12:00,13728, TURNCOAT!!!! You're not representing Giesler Boats???
419735,Bernie,2010-01-07 23:52:00,3190, Well....sort of Roy. Let's just say a division of it.
419753,purekgw,2010-01-08 00:18:00,585,ill be there on the 9th i think lookin around at some of the kayaks there
419765,Radnine,2010-01-08 00:40:00,1538," Oh, I'll be at the Crestliner booth alright. Jim"
419801,BUSTER,2010-01-08 01:54:00,1336,  LOL  I was waiting for that
419846,Dara,2010-01-08 03:00:00,3052,Can I get a deal on a new fish finder?
419848,irishfield,2010-01-08 03:03:00,26272,Doubt it...
419853,Radnine,2010-01-08 03:14:00,1538," Look, I should rephrase that, I am not chest thumping here. I am going to look forward to talking to them because I know that my dealer will be there and that we will have a great chat on how we can sort this out. It is also my understanding that there will be customer service types from the mother ship, and I will look forward to speaking with them. I will also look forward to meeting Bernie as he is the captain of my fishing team, and by all accounts, a good egg (that has shown good business sense by not weighing in on the original thread regarding the recall, when it appears that there is some connection). Jim"
419862,HTHM,2010-01-08 03:31:00,4082,"Jim, I wish I had clients like you. Even better, an occasional fishing partner as well."
419863,Dara,2010-01-08 03:33:00,3052,  yur kiddin right?  a friend will be there..I think he prostaffs for lowrance or something..not real sure...I'm hoping he can do something for me. I'm looking towards a HDS 7 or 8 with sidescan
419874,irishfield,2010-01-08 03:42:00,26272,Nope.. probably score a better deal online somewhere..  Cost of booths at these things doesn't bring out many deals.
419882,chrispyke,2010-01-08 03:57:00,51,"Never go to the boat show...last time I went it cost me $20,000    ...much cheaper to stay home !  BL"
