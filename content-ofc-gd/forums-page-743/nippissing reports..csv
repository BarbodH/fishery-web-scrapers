We had very limited success. We fished for 3 days with 4 guys and got 3 walleye, a 14"" a 12"" and a 9"". We caught about 85 perch, with no real jumbos, 1 herring 1pike and about 10 mudpuppies. It used to be that the opening week was a bonanza for the walleye, but the last few years have painted a different picture. At least that is what it was in my experience. How about some fishing experience from those who did fish on Lake Nippissing?"
