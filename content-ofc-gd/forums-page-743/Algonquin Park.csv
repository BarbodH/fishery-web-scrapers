(The website doesn't specify and the office is closed for the day).  We each have to pay the $11 per night to stay in the Interior, but what about parking?  I know day parking passes cost like $15/night, but those expire at 10:00pm.  Is there a certain parking lot for interior campers that are leaving their car for their trip and does it have a set price?  (We'd be accessing at Opeongo)."
420192,solopaddler,2010-01-08 23:36:00,8605,"There's free parking at all of the interior access points. You must have an interior camping permit though, one copy of which goes on your windshield. If you don't have the permit on your windshield you'll get ticketed."
420193,ADB,2010-01-08 23:44:00,444," Thanks a lot, Solo."
420256,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2010-01-09 02:20:00,0,"have fun!  interior camping is pretty much the epitome of fishing.  sure the fishing isn't always fast and furious all the time, but the experience of fishing/camping in the backcountry is second to none.  and it's the only place in the world where i've ever thought whiskey/gatorade was a good idea.  hehehe...  troutologist knows what i'm talking about."
420340,dannyboy,2010-01-09 13:41:00,367,"Like Mike said, you make reservations by phone then register when you get to the park, they give you a permit to leave in your vehicle and one to take into the park. The reservation system has been changed from last year and is still working out some kinks, we booked our spring trip two weeks ago and are still waiting for confirmation. You can book 5 months in advance so book early if you can.  Dan"
420407,ADB,2010-01-09 18:02:00,444," Lol...gatorade is exactly what we were thinking too.  Yeah, it should be great.  We were planning on going last year...I think I even started a thread back then about it...but I go to York, and by the time I got off after the strike it was mid-June.  We're looking at going up to Lavielle.  It looks tough, but it'll be worth it."
420416,douG,2010-01-09 18:30:00,2693,"LaVielle is a tough slog, but generally the further you venture into the interior, the better the fishing.  Hope you have a great trip.  I'll be answering the call of Algonquin myself, first week of May.  Once you experience that most beautiful park, it's really hard to stay away.  Check out Algonquin Adventures Forum for a message board devoted to Algonquin Park."
420417,Cookslav,2010-01-09 18:32:00,1457,"Lavielle is a tough trip, but its a nice area of the park for sure. That last portage is long, and looks dautning but its fairly flat....wear nice boots if your tripping in early Spring, some sections can be a bit muddy/swampy. Are you going to use the Water Taxi on Opeongo to shave some time?  Just a thought?"
420418,ADB,2010-01-09 18:34:00,444," Yeah, everything I've read said the water taxi is a no-brainer."
420420,Cookslav,2010-01-09 18:42:00,1457," If the weather turns a bit sour....you'll be thanking yourself for saving a days travel, not to mention your arms will thank you LOL! Cheers,"
