419577,limeyangler,2010-01-07 14:45:00,5204,"Hi all,  told a friend about the good fishing i had the other day, he wanted to check it out for himself. he is an experienced fisherman but had not fished this local lake before. He also just started renting an appartment on the lake so we set off from his landing...which is pretty cool cuz now i dont have to pay $10 this summer at the boat launch!  We caught lots of fish (lol...i did catch fish too...just too busy filming my buddy....HONEST!)  Did try some deeper water too (90FOW). only difference was that there were fewer baitfish out deeper, but when the bait came through there was always around 3 or 4 trout circling right along with it, not so in the shallower 60FOW, bait fish on screen the whole time at that depth with trout moving in periodically. We also caught a lot of Ling, i kept a big one i got , mmmmmmmmmm....best eating fish in my opinion.   BROKE MY NEW YEAR RESOLUTION ALREADY....MORE BLEEPING I""M AFRAID  "

419876,Jds63,2010-01-08 03:49:00,1365,keep up the great work Simon ... love the vids  were you guys using white tubes with whole minnows ?
419879,bigugli,2010-01-08 03:53:00,6138,Well done there.  Even after a couple of decent days on the pond you still make me drool.
419889,limeyangler,2010-01-08 04:08:00,5204," Yeah JDS....seemed to be the ticket when we hit the deeper water, but i hatched an evil plan....lol the water is soooo clear on that lake...the tubes and minnows would attract the trout but the would kinda just nose at it a lot. I let my buddy bring 'em in, then i'd drop my plain jig and small minnow down to where the trout was chasing his jig on the screen and 2 out of three times they';d nail my bait...and you think i was cursing in that vid....LOLOLOL    I seen your mess of perch Bruce......nice, fat, tasty ones too."
