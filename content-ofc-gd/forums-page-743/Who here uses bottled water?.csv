420296,Slop,2010-01-09 04:00:00,151,"I've been on bottled water here since moving from the GTA to Ottawa seven years ago. When I moved here and tasted the tap water, it was like drinking from a small weedy lake...the kind of lake I like to fish. I hated it!! I do'nt mind showering in it or using it for appliances but that's about it.  The same applies to drinking bottled water when I'm at my little womens place in Quebec, but for whatever reason the water does not smell or taste weedy and is super cold in the summer months when I run the taps.  I still visit the GTA for meetings once a month and the water is not as pleasant to drink as my bottle that came from the hills around Blue Mountain....Collingwood area.  Cheers!.....to bottled water"

420391,T Fisher,2010-01-09 17:20:00,139,The city of Toronto wants all the water users to run your tap for a minimum of 5 minutes before drinking. And you think we are the fools. Have you ever seen the inside of a 50 year old delivery water pipe ? I have seen many  if you ever get a chance take a look and ponder what you are putting in your body.

We use them here (in oakville, and previously toronto) because we don't like the lake water and have a little one in the house.  For my own use, not really that worried about it.  And, when we're away from Lake O we just use tap water.

419674,aplumma,2010-01-07 21:10:00,6896,  You might want to change this to the pipes and fittings are soldered with 50/50 lead/tin solder. The carbon filters that are found on the end of tap water are useless due to the contact time and the tunnel effect that occurs as the water passes thru the filter. If you want to remove Taste Odor and organic contaminants then a gravity carbon filter or a Reverse Osmosis system is the best choice.   Art
419736,irishfield,2010-01-07 23:53:00,26272,Got a guy in one of our buildings that is bottling water from a specific underground water source.

419742,Bernie,2010-01-08 00:03:00,3190,"In my little town we sit on one of the greatest aquifers in the world. And until the water scare a few years back nothing was added to our water supply. Apparently it didn't even need to be filtered but is. Now chlorine is added just because it's legislated. Sad really. But to answer your question Cliff, no I personally don't use bottled water."
419747,Dano,2010-01-08 00:07:00,719," Well for starters it can remove the taste and odour of the chlorine that the governing body pumped into it. I prefer a whole house carbon filtre though, about the size of a water softner without the brine tank.  To answer your question Cliff, yes I use it but only the large glass bottled carbonated mineral water. I will however bring my own water in a re usable rubbermaid thing to the gym etc ."
419752,Terry,2010-01-08 00:16:00,14456,I think chlorine is better as a secondary treatment better to use UV as primary
419761,Dano,2010-01-08 00:31:00,719, You are correct Terry but current legislation requires chlorination if the water is distributed through underground piping. All of the systems I have designed and installed get both.

The water always tests fine.  The biggest reason we use the bottled water, is we have a water cooler with the hot water tap.

It can be bottled from ANY source... even that tap you have an issue with coming out of Lake Ontario.  The bottler does not need any licence to bottle and sell water and does not have to disclose where they are getting the water... unless they label it as Spring water and then they have to list the springs source
420146,kickingfrog,2010-01-08 21:10:00,8333," No, no, no don't tell them that. Why would people want to know the truth when they could pay 2-3 dollars per litre (remember what happens when gasoline goes over a $1/L?) for water that is the same as what comes out of their taps...FOR ALMOST NOTHING, and they get the added benefit of that yummy plastic taste.

I do still use them when I go fishing but re-fill them with tap water a couple times before recycling them.  From what I hear Nestle takes their water from little streams / creeks to the point where they become mud flats and can no longer sustain any flow or life.  Other companies take water from 3rd world countries, taking the resource away from the VERY poor and charge them to try and get it back."
419540,Big Cliff,2010-01-07 12:55:00,6899," I had a company approach me to do some marketing for them, they have developed a system to replace the ""bottled"" water units. Things are very slow at work right now for me and it looks like it might be an interesting project but I wanted to get an idea of who and why people are using the bottled water before I decide if I want to take it on.  We have never used it other than the small bottles when we are traveling or fishing. Our water supply here goes through a lot of stages; iron/sulpher removal, water softner, UV, and then a 5 stage RO system for our drinking water so I don't have much experience with the ""Bottled"" stuff.  One of the best resources I know of are the people on this board"
419542,Hud,2010-01-07 13:15:00,140,Not sure if this helps or not but I in university I studied water quality and was taught that there are actually less tests and regulations on bottled water than tap water.  (At least in the States) so have always just ran tap water through a filter.  Anyway...hope it helps.  Good luck on your project

We stopped buying the small bottles by the case due to the recycling issue...(too many were not being recycled and ending up in landfill sites)  BTW...We mainly bought the water cooler and large bottles for any company we had especially kids as a change of water can do nasty things to their systems...Our tap water tasted a bit swampy after it warmed up so I started using the bottled for my coffee and still do even though they have finished the new water station ages ago...still has lots of minerals...we have to descale kettles etc. quite often...

There is a well 3 blocks from my house. It is in a little block building. The water is pumped out of the ground, gets a little shot of chlorine for a just in case, and goes into the pipes. I trust that way more than any bottle I would buy off the store shelf.

419622,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2010-01-07 17:20:00,0," at least filters do have legit purposes.  homes/buildings that are older, still contain lead pipes, which is a source of contamination post water treatment.  i believe provincially 10 ppb or something is an acceptable level...people with more than that are advised to use filters.  many people use charcoal filters because it does sometimes change the water.  when i lived in london i had to use a brita because the water smelled funny until i filtered it.  it may have been part in my head, but it seemed to work.  i agree that ""scam"" is the best word for bottled water!!!!"

There is a Brita unit in the fridge, but I can't tell the difference in taste at all.  If I need to have some portable water, it's tap water into a reusable bottle, like a Memart bottle or a Siggs."
