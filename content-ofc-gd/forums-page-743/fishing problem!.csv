I just got out of a 2 year relationship with someone that tried to control my every move.. Fishing was at the best of time difficult. There was always some reason as to why she did not want me to go etc.. and going out with budddies was out of the question! She had major separation issues..  Anyways..  I finally had enough (3 weeks ago) and am currently residing in a god aweful basement apartment, until Feb 1st when I move back into my House (had to give the people I rented it too notice) and have never been happier. (Except for the daily calls from her looking for yet another argument...)  Anyways... I did not want this to turn into a post about me.. but rather say it sounds alot like what I went through..  G"

Think it has pretty much all been said, I would keep the original plans with the first buddy (poor guy), but I agree with most here the guy has to stand up to his wife and would he not have figured all this out before he married her!!

My buddy and I would fish bass tourneys and on the way home stop for some dinner and a cold one after a hot day on the water. Well one morning before I left for the day of fishing she asked me to come straight home after fishing because she was going to prepare a lovely meal for me. When I got home she was gone and there was a pan of hamburger helper on the stove ice cold. No big deal I warmed it up and ate it, and I hate that crap. Its called compromise. I figured something came up and she had to switch plans. Well a few weeks later she told me I fish too much and to get rid of the bass boat or she was leaving. Well to make a long story short she is now my ex and my new girl wishes I could go fishing every day cause she says it makes me so happy. Im really lovin this gal. Tell your buddy to tell her that i'll bring you home the big one. Then she should be fine."

Realistically, it should be way easier to accommodate the odd day trip with your local friend another time, and if he was that into fishing he should understand!  Why should his marital discord hurt a good couple days of fishing for you!  Good luck either way"

419954,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2010-01-08 06:19:00,0,crooked's just dirty with little eaters eh?  such a fun lake.

419284,pike slayer,2010-01-06 22:00:00,1177,"Ok, so heres my dilemma! My buddy was my bestest fishing buddy that i went fishing with just about every single weekend got married back in may. Since then i've gotten him out for one afternoon of fishing and his wife made a big deal about it. Now he called me on Monday and said that she'll let him go fishing this saturday because shes working all day. i was like sure we'll head into our old stompin' grounds and go slay some lake trout. Now last night my other buddy called me up and said he heading up to camp for 4-5 days and that i should head up there for a night or 2 and fish with him. the camp is 3hours north of here and i've only been up once in the winter and would love to fish it again for specks, big pike, big lake trout and whitefish. So i told him that i kinda had plans but i'd call my other buddy back to see if he could go up to the camp to. So i call up my whipped friend and say hey chris called and was wondering if i wanted to head up to the camp. now we should both go up early saturday fish all day, stay the night and fish sunday and come home in the evening. Well ohhh no i dont think the wife will let me stay the night!! geezus!! its one night!! come on now!! now i have another buddy that wants to fish sunday and he wants to head up into my lake trout stompin grounds to slay them. and hes saying ohhh no dont worry about me, head up to camp we'll just go another time!(not sure if hes taking me on a guilt trip or what) so now im up in the air and i dont know what i should do?? stay in town and fish 2 days on the same lake and get an old friend out and show another buddy a hot spot OR head up into camp which i dont always get the opportunity to do in the winter. OR i could say to my first buddy that we are heading up to the stompin grounds and just keep driving to the camp and say toooo bad you can deal with it when you get home!! what do i do???"
419285,archie_james_c,2010-01-06 22:03:00,618,Stay home...get drunk pass out in snow bank and walk to the bar with a half hour left till last call
419286,pike slayer,2010-01-06 22:04:00,1177,hahaha!! actually try and make it this time unlike new years
419293,BillM,2010-01-06 22:26:00,17367,I'd keep the original plans with your buddy.  You can fish the camp another time...
419294,foggynotions,2010-01-06 22:27:00,21,"Thats an easy one, go to camp... fish your face off and take a ton of pictures of all the great fish you catch and the good times.  Then when you get back to town show your buddy's (especially the whipped one) and tell them what they missed by being all ghey!!  Points Worm Dangler  2 - Buddies 0"
419296,wuchikubo,2010-01-06 22:31:00,1114,"Here's my first thought and suggestion: Approach your wife's friend when you visit him and ask why she has such a problem with you two friends fishing. Get the answer from her and then if it's workable, ask him in front of her to go fishing on the trip. At least you will know your friend has the answer to future fishing trips and what the limits may be without him getting into the doghouse.  HF"
419298,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2010-01-06 22:33:00,0,"in a situation like that, your buddy just has to grow a set.  just because a guy gets married, doesn't mean he should stop fishing! in fact, he needs to have his time away and so does she, otherwise they won't be successful...  i'd do whatever is best for you in that situation because counting on a whipped buddy won't get you anywhere."
419301,Roy,2010-01-06 22:39:00,13728,"You do what YOU want to do. It seems to me that you'd prefer to do the winter 4-5 day thing to the lake for trout etc. Do it. If you compromise once now, the next compromise will be just around the corner and you'll spend your life doing things because of your Bud's maladroitness at picking a life partner. However, you can still go to the 4-5 day trip and help your first Bud in the process. She is working Saturday....get out to his place on the pretext that you need to borrow something for the trip and while there ask to go to the can. From there, arrange to have a dirty pair of ladies undies in you pocket and drop them in the laundry hamper. That should free him up for fishing for a few years to come.  I hope this helps."

Ask her (your buddy) how come Mrs P3TA will let her (your buddy) fish when she(her wife) is at work but not when she isn't?  Could be that she is bending a little and you may get your fishing partner back...   4 days at camp is pretty enticing though...he really should come for at least an overnighter. All he has to say is...dear..i'm gonna do that fishing trip Saturday that you said I could,,,but I won't be back till sunday night...then head for the door"
419444,GoneFishin,2010-01-07 02:40:00,349," LMAO, I love this thread.  Why should you have to loose out because of your buddy? The only reason this fishing trip is so ""important"" to you is because you never get the chance to go fishing with your him. But, is that really your fault? There's all the time in the world to go fishing but only one day that ""HE"" has nothing to do and will go out fishing with yah. Not really fair to YOU his old ""buddy"".  I wouldn't recommend asking her why she doesn't want you to go out fishing together..  From my experience with all my ""buddies"" girlfriends who are like this it will only make things a lot worst!! Your buddy probably won't have enough balls to have your back either, or else he would of just told her in the first place that he need's some time for him self to catch up with friends.  I say go enjoy fishing up at the camp with your other buddy since you don't get a chance to go fishing up there often."
