420136,basketclam,2010-01-08 20:45:00,115,I had a dream the other night that I caught a really big bass - the one in my dream wasn't even that big.

420269,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2010-01-09 02:47:00,0,it's pretty epic to see a bass that large.  when the pics of this monster first surfaced i was definitely rooting for this guy. i grew up seeing tv shows do episodes on castaic or okeechobee...definitely didn't even see this coming.  cultural ignorance on my part i guess. wow.
