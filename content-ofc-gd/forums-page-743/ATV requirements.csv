What is required for us to be legal on the ice?  I am guessing the following:  Helmets Registration (where do you do this?) Plates Insurance  What about for towing gear? I am guessing you need to have some sort of tow bar or something? How do you attach this to portable shelters/sleds etc?  Thanks in advance for the answers!"
420379,T Fisher,2010-01-09 16:24:00,139,You need to register the quad with the MTO. I believe you have 10 day's.  Insurance minimum is liability. Have the slip of paper in your wallet.  Helmuts are a must.  Towing anything you must have a solid bar attatchment to whatever you're towing.  Good fishing.

I bought a combo hitch from CTC for about 50 bucks, which allows ball hitch(your choice of size for what you tow, sold separately), pintel hitch, and pin hitch for my Polar Boggan for ice fishing. Helmet is mandatory."
