420125,bigugli,2010-01-08 20:18:00,6138,Just another extension of Darwin's law. Weak seed has to be removed from the gene pool somehow.
420126,asdve23rveavwa,2010-01-08 20:19:00,2690,"Makes me think of a comment a co-worker said the other day.  She didn't see any kids playing outside during the Christmas holidays...it's said how many kids these days are sucked into a videoscreen (as I sit here typing this looking at one, lol). Yes, teach your kids or nephews or nieces to fish or hunt...can't wait until Sunday, taking the three boys ice fishing for the first time. Don't force it on them, but, give them the option...you might end up with a fishing buddy for life!!!!!"
420128,redneck666,2010-01-08 20:20:00,563,honestly one of the most moronic things i've seen yet......
420161,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2010-01-08 22:20:00,0,i hope that was his dad's truck.
420171,uglyfish,2010-01-08 22:43:00,981,"i wanna listen in on both the calls to the police to explain how the accident occured, and then to the insurance company. lol"
420174,fishing n autograph,2010-01-08 22:52:00,2540,This falls under the Stunt Driving laws...it's not just about speed.  This is as moronic as standing up on the seat of your crotch rocket at high speeds
420178,fishing n autograph,2010-01-08 22:56:00,2540,This falls under the Stunt Driving laws...it's not just about speed.  This is as moronic as standing up on the seat of your crotch rocket at high speeds both are known as ghost riding and happens far too often..
420184,irishfield,2010-01-08 23:03:00,26272,"You are right David... but that said, anyone here that is up against a ""stunt driving"" charge for doing 50+ over the speed limit.. grab a lawyer. The charge and having you face jail time for it is against Section 7 of the Charter of rights.. and you will walk and the crown will get your legal costs. Talk of even a class action suit being launched against the province for all that have been processed to date. 2 Judges have set precidence by throwing out Stunt driving charges as a violation of Section 7 of the Charter."
420191,Greencoachdog,2010-01-08 23:30:00,8163,Could alcohol have been involved?... surely not!!!
420222,kickingfrog,2010-01-09 00:47:00,8333,"Funny thing is, that is about as good as that situation could have turned out.  meathead"
420307,Dozer,2010-01-09 04:58:00,896,"I can't stop laughing, I bet it was a good idea at the time."
420309,HTHM,2010-01-09 05:07:00,4082,"Here, hold my beer and watch this...."
420334,ld17,2010-01-09 12:51:00,319,hey video me and watch my insurance rates go up next year!
420387,Governator,2010-01-09 17:06:00,879,"I've seen dozens of these ghost riding videos, for some reason they always end the same."
420453,fish-miester,2010-01-09 21:01:00,864,wow.. what an idiot
