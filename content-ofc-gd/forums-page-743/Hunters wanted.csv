420436,Daplumma,2010-01-09 19:47:00,1961,There seems to be a small deer problem at the golf course.They are talking about bringing in some huters for a special hunt.Do we really need this?  
420441,Twocoda,2010-01-09 19:59:00,4130,most definatly ....if the golf courses are wrecked then people will take up fishing and crowd the rivers and lakes...  seriously though ...if there has been an abundance of car meets deer scenarios in the area then they need a bonus hunt to make the roads safe to pass...but to open a special hunt to protect a golf course...i think not ...  my 02
420448,Greencoachdog,2010-01-09 20:29:00,8163,They should leave the deer alone and open season on golfers!

420538,taper,2010-01-10 01:32:00,611,Daplumma I was just through your neck of the woods yesterday and in one hour on the interstate at 70mph we counted 12 deer on the side of the road. This was around 1pm. I don't think I have ever seen an area with more deer. It was a great thing to see.
