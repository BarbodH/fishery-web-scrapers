420270,Beats,2010-01-09 02:51:00,543,"Hey guys, got a quick Q for you.  I have my 3 year license still but my friend needs one for fishing tomorrow.  We tried ot get one at a CDn Tire the other day but for some reason they said they didn't have any and wouldn't get any for a few days for some reason.   I've always gotten mine online and I'm hoping someone can tell me where the best/quickest spot in or around London would be to get one tomorrow morning?  I know of all the bait and tackle shops but I can't say I've heard of ppl getting licenses at them.  Cdn Tire, walmart??  Im essentially hoping to just find a spot to pick one up on the way to fishing.  Thanks."
420277,Greencoachdog,2010-01-09 03:08:00,8163,Try some place that sells them!!!   ... I'd start at CTC.
420282,xeon,2010-01-09 03:23:00,350,"  Give angling sport or Lambeth rod and tackle a call. Also theres like 4 canadian tires in london and one in St.Thomas. I know in St.Thomas there's a variety store near the library that sells them which is about 4mins down the way from Canadian tire there.  On second thought, why does the OMNR not have a list of fishing license retailers?"
420285,Greencoachdog,2010-01-09 03:31:00,8163,  ... and why doesn't Beats know where to get one???
420289,bigugli,2010-01-09 03:42:00,6138," Unfortunately, not all CTC stores, or tackle shops can issue licences. Only so many retailers within a specified area get a franchise.  So a readily available list on the website would be great and make sense.  We all know that the words 'government' and 'sense' are contradictions"
420292,FisherMike,2010-01-09 03:49:00,108,jacks in delaware should have them.  i think lambeth is closed till the 11th.  why not just get one online at the mnr store??
420293,splashhopper,2010-01-09 03:53:00,2931,CTC on Fanshawe at Hyde Park had them on Tuesday.... at the customer service desk.
420298,xeon,2010-01-09 04:04:00,350, You're totally useless.
420302,Beats,2010-01-09 04:19:00,543,"  Perfect.  Thanks, thats where we were the other day.  Will pick one up in the AM.  THanks again."
420304,splashhopper,2010-01-09 04:28:00,2931, Hope they still have them beats
420305,Sinker,2010-01-09 04:44:00,8692,The service canada kiosk downtown should have them too. I bought a turkey license in there anyways..........  S.
420361,wildeye rainbow,2010-01-09 15:42:00,123,"The variety store in St T mentioned earlier is called Dixie Lee.  There also is a tackle store in St T, called Tons o Tackle on Welington St.  Both stores have licences as well as quality fishing tackle & bait.  I'll have to head out and get my annual license & I may try a local pond for some ice fishing this aft."
420465,wildeye rainbow,2010-01-09 21:33:00,123,"Ton's of Tackle is closed.  If you're in St T, the Dixie Dairy Bar on St Catherine's Street has fishing licences - I got mine this morning there & btw, they have more variety of GULP than I've ever seen around here (even 1"" minnow imitations)."
