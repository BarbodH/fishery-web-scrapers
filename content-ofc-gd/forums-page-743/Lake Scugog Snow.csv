420034,kingjames_2nd,2010-01-08 17:23:00,72,I am planning to bring a friend out to Lake Scugog on the View Lake  or Caesarea side.  He is disabled and uses a manual wheel chair.  Is the snow on the lake very deep so that it would impede a wheelchair and require a tobogan ride?
420042,Hud,2010-01-08 18:03:00,140,not sure about getting your buddy out there.  What I saw was packed but there are some drifts that would make it a bit tough depends on when you're looking at going.  Its not supposed to be that windy on the bog but they are calling for snow this weekend good luck man
420343,Guest skeeter99,2010-01-09 14:02:00,0,  lets put it this way way to much for a wheelchair  the snow was pushing back on the atv the other day  probably have to pull out in a sled
