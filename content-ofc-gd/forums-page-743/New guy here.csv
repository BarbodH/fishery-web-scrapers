420037,Jigs_up,2010-01-08 17:29:00,11,"Well, I've got pictures of beer! Most of my winter fishing is done on Quinte for walleye and perch. I do manage to get onto Simcoe a couple of times a winter with some buddies that live up that way. In the summer I'm not picky. I'll target anything that's willing to take my bait. Walleye, bass and trout are my main objectives though. I consider myself accomplished in that I have caught fish before but there's a loooooooonnnnnggg learning curve ahead. Lifes an adventure.......Live it! Thanks for welcoming me aboard.  Cheers"
