674179,BITEME,2012-03-08 13:21:00,1968,A couple of guys from our unit were in the last one they did. Although it is very informative to see and I do recommend you see it I think anyone that plays in cold water should test out their gear in the same cold water in a controlled manner(beach with a rope and a buddy) in very cold water not dressed for the pool but with everything on you are going to be out in(make sure it floats you). It is a shock and what you think may be your reaction to a situation changes very quickly when you loose your grip  Just saying Peter
