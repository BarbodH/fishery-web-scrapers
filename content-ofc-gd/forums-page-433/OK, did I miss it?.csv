670098,Big Cliff,2012-02-26 19:18:00,6899,"It takes a special personality to be able to deal with such a wide range of customers under ever changing conditions and keep everyone reasonably satisified. The good operators are the ones that have that ability, or at least they make you feel that they have really tried!  Understanding that for many this weekend trip they are on is a once a year thing and many have had to save just to be able to do it. Naturally they want it to be something special so when you run into an operator that isn't willing to go out of their way to make this the weekend you've dreamed of, well it kind of leaves a sour taste in your mouth. Saddly, from the reports I have read so far Snowfari is one of the operators that view customers as a nusiance and all they want them to do is hand over money and shut up.  Will their reputation put them out of business? Not likely, there will always be the uneducated or the first timers that don't know any better. It is a shame that many will be turned off from the experience and may never venture out on a trip like it again."
670314,johnnyb,2012-02-27 13:50:00,3413,"Well the kijiji ad for an icefishing bungalow business in NorthBay happens to have the same phone number as Snofari....  Good report...as others have said, having the bungalow in a poor location doesn't make sense.  Great example of how attitude makes or breaks a trip."
670326,asdve23rveavwa,2012-02-27 14:57:00,2690," It would be great to see someone take over that business, and, run it properly.  Alot of damage has been done, so obviously a name change would be the first order of business.  Like others on here have mentioned, it truly is a customer service venture."
670335,Big Cliff,2012-02-27 15:53:00,6899," Yes, and it would make a lot more sense to delay renting huts out by a week or two and then putting them in locations where the customers are more likely to catch fish. True you might loose one or two weekends of revenue but you would build a client base that would come back year after year and a reputation that would keep your huts full all the time.  You could probably raise your rates a bit to compensate for the lost weekends at the beginning of the season. Most of the people I know would gladly pay an extra $25.00 for a weekend if they knew they were likely to get some good fishing in as opposed to catching mud puppies all night."
673798,bramptonjerry,2012-03-07 06:03:00,132,"was driven by them on my way out this week-end, their huts are way too close to shore(almost seems like you've just left the shore) was told they never move their huts all season, we were taken out approx 5 kms past their location and put on fish.  What they are best at is advertising on the net"
668951,Big Cliff,2012-02-22 20:51:00,6899,I was waiting to see what sort of a report he came back with and I am wondering if I missed it somewhere or he was just too embarassed to post about it?
668961,pics,2012-02-22 21:35:00,1268,This should be good....
668962,Jer,2012-02-22 21:45:00,1426,I've been waiting as well...
668968,bubbles,2012-02-22 22:25:00,591,Huh?
668972,Roy,2012-02-22 22:31:00,13728,He hasn't been online since the 17th at 12:40AM. Might be having trouble hauling all the fish back.
668999,ketchenany,2012-02-22 23:59:00,3229,me too. this iPad thing may not be suitable for major OFC reports.
669001,Roy,2012-02-23 00:06:00,13728,"Ok Snowfari, where is Mike and what have you done with him?"
669003,ketchenany,2012-02-23 00:11:00,3229,"Probably ""pushing"" the huts to deeper water . . . Saves 'extra' costs."
669062,asdve23rveavwa,2012-02-23 03:16:00,2690,"I need Dave's popcorn eating emoticon, again!!!  I really am curious though, I still shudder to think that I almost booked with Snowfari last year."
669177,limeyangler,2012-02-23 18:10:00,5204,snowfar so good
669183,Rod Caster,2012-02-23 18:17:00,5784,A mudpuppy in gunshot pose with reel in mouth would have been epic.  
669290,Rizzo,2012-02-23 23:21:00,4754,ok so I'm not the only one waiting to see if things have improved or there's nothing new under the sun
669293,Roy,2012-02-23 23:29:00,13728,Look at the bright side though. Maybe they're the hot place to go to now and Mike is so overwhelmed with joy that he's too emotional at the moment to post his report. That'd be great really. Especially for Mike but also for others planning a trip.
669900,mike HT,2012-02-25 21:57:00,4," Alright.. Sorry guys since i have been back i have done nothing but study, write midterms, eat and sleep. Snowfari... First off, the service was actually good. He has 2 guys that came around every morning and changed our crapper and our dish water, they also came around at 11 and 330 to see if we wanted to go out near the day huts so they could drill holes for us. They had a hut with minnows, dishwater and other necessities about 100 yards from us so if we needed anything we could just walk and get it.  Next, hut location... Is wasnt very far off land and the fishing wasnt that good for us (its about 25-30 feet under the huts). All we got from the hut was 1 jumbo perch and about 8 mud puppies, but we did drive to the hut so we were able to take off to wherever we wanted. We would drive out a couple kilometers at 11 and come back around 6, we caught just about our limit of walleye everyday and a couple of perch, so we were happy about that. The weather was beautiful, blue bird -5 to -15, and no wind, we dont have a portable hut so the weather saved us!  We had no problems with the owners, they seem like if you give them crap they will give you crap. So we didnt give them crap and didnt get out of control with the drinking at night and there were no problems.  Overall 7.5 to 8, if the fishing picked up in the hut so we had something to do at night then just drink this trip would of been as good as it gets."

669924,Fisherman,2012-02-26 00:58:00,7201,How about
669926,Roy,2012-02-26 01:04:00,13728,Well I'm glad you had a decent time Mike. By all reports it wasn't looking good for you there.
669969,Joeytier,2012-02-26 03:20:00,3990,LOL.  Everyone seemed hellbent on giving you a hard-time.  I bet some folks are bummed to see such a positive report.  Good on ya for having a great time and getting some fish.
670003,Sinker,2012-02-26 06:31:00,8692,"just goes to show you can't believe everything you read on the internet! Sounds like you guys did alright, and had a good time!  S."
670010,Big Cliff,2012-02-26 10:36:00,6899,"Well, I am glad it turned out better than most of the other reports we've seen on the place but I have to be honest, it will take a lot of glowing reports before I spend my money with them. Thanks for posting though!"
670011,crappieperchhunter,2012-02-26 10:49:00,2582,Still doesn't cut it for an ice bungalow experience as far as I  am concerned. The only reason I would stay in one of those sub par things is if I had fish right under me. That's what the whole experience is about as far as I am concerned. If you have to get up in the morning and jump in your vehicle to go searching for fish you might as well stay with another outfitter in a nice COMFY ROOMY cabin on shore with a shower and all the other conveniences... and have them drive you out to there fishing shacks with fish right under them.  Thanks however for taking the time to post a report.
670019,Jer,2012-02-26 12:51:00,1426,Good to hear that they've pulled up their socks and you had a good time.
670044,asdve23rveavwa,2012-02-26 14:41:00,2690, BINGO!!  But. Good to hear the OP enjoyed it.
670088,bubbles,2012-02-26 18:28:00,591,"  EXACTLY!  I think the report is exactly what I expected to read.  There are no fish where he is located, with the exception of some mud puppies.  Why would you go there just to use the bungalow for a place to sleep, go to a cabin or motel and enjoy sleeping in a bed instead of on plywood and crapping in a toilet instead of a pail.  South Shore Ice Condos all the way!"
670094,Roy,2012-02-26 18:58:00,13728,"It sounds like no matter how hard the dude tries, he'll never succeed. Just one of those things I guess. I'm still glad that Mike had a good time."
