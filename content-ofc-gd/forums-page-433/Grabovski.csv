673799,hawk-eye,2012-03-07 06:37:00,141, I find it sad when fans are critisized for talking about their team.
673828,grimsbylander,2012-03-07 13:15:00,3016,"  Come on Kickingfrog! You're having a battle of wits with an unarmed man. I've read enough of your posts to know you're smarter than that.  MuskyMatt is that guy we all know who has to put down other people to feel good about himself. He constantly criticizes and belittles other people to draw attention to himself. If you can't rise above the crowd, knock them down to your level. His comments are limited to a few simple expressions of jest which he is forced to regurgitate over and over regardless of the thread topic. My suggestion? Skip the MuskyMatt's comments because you'll be a little dumber after reading them and hold out for the guys who make genuine constructive criticizisms which demonstate interesting points of view."
673850,muskymatt,2012-03-07 14:12:00,2608,"So let me get this right! I'm supposedly of a lesser intellect because I'm not a laff fan, I don't know hockey and I regurgitate senseless comments not worthy of consideration. Hmmmmm.....seems to me I have stated some obvious, made some opinions and have done do without getting personal to individuals. I have also stated my respect for laff fans on sticking through all the years(and there's lots of em) of sucking. The laff management and ownership has been a joke since the last cup, many, if not all of you have expressed this yourselves. Bad decisions have been made for years, again, many of you have stated this as well. Yes I'm not a laff fan, was once, but no more, as much as I respect your right to follow your team, I expect the same. The battle of Ontario has been going on for years, it isn't going to stop any time soon, so get used to it. You can continue in your educated support of the laffs and I'll go along in my uneducated ,dumb little way of being as annoying as a laff fan at Scotia Bank Place."
673852,Brettiop,2012-03-07 14:17:00,279," Must be fun making things up in your sens bubble...  We were definitely ALL doing ALL of those things, every one of us"
673854,grimsbylander,2012-03-07 14:22:00,3016,   Better to be silent and thought a fool than to open your mouth and remove all doubt.
673855,muskymatt,2012-03-07 14:38:00,2608,Typical response from a laff fan. Is that an educated statement derived from knowledge? Or is it simply speculation? Or maybe it's just the way laff fans view all others who aren't laff fans. Maybe being in your little box you call laff nation has clouded your ability to be objective! Whatever!! GO Sens Go
673858,grimsbylander,2012-03-07 14:52:00,3016,"  Great response!! Ouch! dusted off the old dictionary on that one! You better nap, you must be exhausted."

673869,DRIFTER_016,2012-03-07 15:52:00,10439,  Maybe so but at least we'll still have a team after McSquinty gets rid of the corporate tax breaks.

674070,hawk-eye,2012-03-08 01:50:00,141,I thought this topic was for discusion about Grabovskis new contract. You want to rant about Leaf fans go and highjack a thread on another forum.
674112,BassAsin,2012-03-08 03:29:00,806,  Haha you're right. Just goes to show how terrible the rest of the forwards are in their zone.
673624,kickingfrog,2012-03-06 21:44:00,8333," The only relevant salaries in that group are the guys who signed deals the year they were going to be UFAs. That makes the list 3-4 guys: St. Louis, Hossa, Elias and maybe Sharp. None of the other guys could walk, meaning the team had more leverage.  The only salary number that matters is the yearly cap hit, not the decreasing yearly dollars at the end of the deals that are listed.  You want a 36 or 35 year old for the next 5 years in todays fast game?"
673625,Cudz,2012-03-06 21:45:00,2652,lol.  It is now.
673645,Jigger,2012-03-06 22:41:00,1237,"I would've thought 5per would've got it done, but good for the agent! Burke and Nonis realize his worth to the second line and, barring his last little hiccup has shown almost exactly the same progress as St. Louis in his first 5 seasons. Hes invaluable to the Leafs and, IMO, is in the top 5 2nd line Centres in the league. Glad to have him aboard."
673687,Acountdeleted,2012-03-07 00:20:00,2562,"  How come no one has answered my question yet?  The Maple Leafs pretty much have a licence to print money so the cost isn't the issue its the cap hit. The cap is a lot higher then when those guys signed their contracts and I think you'll find that when many of them resign their value will go up to mid 6's, high 7's (don't count St. Louis or Hossa, they're getting old).  Again, its like what kickingfrog said, its all about supply and demand. If you can get a better centre in this offseason for 5.5 million.... or any money value, I'd be impressed."
673688,kickingfrog,2012-03-07 00:25:00,8333,Just read an article that suggested that the only comparable UFA this summer is a 33 year old named Olli Jokinen. Slim pickins indeed.
673725,uglyfish,2012-03-07 02:03:00,981," no its not. it really isnt. sit and watch the games, and watch his play. he shows flashes of excellant hockey, and at times has shows he can be a top 2 way player. most of the time he floats around, and just gets lazy in his own end and ignores his defensive responsibilities."
673740,Lunatic,2012-03-07 03:12:00,536,I think you confused grabo for Connelly
673743,chris.brock,2012-03-07 03:17:00,4053,"I agree with what Kypreos and company said tonight, $5.5 mil equates to 80 points per season consistently, I hope you read that in the Sun tomorrow Grabo, because you're going to have to step it up, you're a rich man, now hold up your end of the bargain  If I had to guess, this is just another screw up that helps to keep the Leafs out of contention for the next few years  I'm a Leaf fan but it's very frustrating putting up with their constant crappy performances, you have to go to the bottom and draft well and rebuild before you can be a contender, the Flyers finished dead last 2 years ago, now they are respectable, why do we consistently suck so hard? ahhhh, I wish I lived in Boston"
673747,muskymatt,2012-03-07 03:26:00,2608,"You laff fans crack me up, first you were all calling for Grabs head and wanting him out. Next you were criticizing Wilson for being out of touch and hard on the players. Now you have a long term contract and are defending it, the new coach is labeled as a no Bull coach who is demanding on the players and you think that is good. On top of that he doesn't hold perimeter, non contact players like Kessels in high regard. Tell me this. How long will it be until Carlysle alienates the team, and Kessel? And how long will Burke tolerate the coach not favoring his pet player? You guys criticize Don Cherry for speaking out and being consistent in his views but, like a bunch of hypocrites you flip flop like a bad waffle. Like a freeking soap opera...As the leaf turns.

673541,anders,2012-03-06 16:42:00,1168,"5.5/ year for a guy that hasn't scored more than 58 points in a year! That means the Malkin is worth 10mil/yr.  Take a look at this contract and will reflect what is wrong with the NHL and leafs today. Overpaid for under achieving. I though the contract my Bruins gave Kreji 3 yrs/5.25 was overpaid.  Thank god we don't have this problem for 5 more years. Now, which other GM in todays world would really trade for this contract in a couple years?  Absolute horrible signing.  enjoy the next few years of mediocrity. This with the overpaid d-men on the leafs is a good thing for the Northwest division teams."
673553,uglyfish,2012-03-06 17:32:00,981,That ranks up there with JFJ signing jeff finger for 4mil a year. Hahahaha.
673554,kickingfrog,2012-03-06 17:33:00,8333,"Grabo isn't just a one way forward. Having said that, the dry spells have got to become less frequent."
673556,uglyfish,2012-03-06 17:37:00,981,He's not a 2 way forward either. He's got very poor defensive zone awareness. And gives the puck away more often then not
673559,Lunatic,2012-03-06 17:38:00,536,"i think its a bit rich for him,would have thought 4.5 with a 5 year term would have made more sense. but keep in mind that GMs have been overpaying on players lately driving up with prices.if you compare grabos new contract with players who have equal or less points than him ,then his right in the mix. worst example would be gomez and his 7.5 million dollar goal. or anyone buffalo has signed in the last year."
673560,Lunatic,2012-03-06 17:39:00,536,what? his 2 way play is probably one of the best on that team.
673565,solopaddler,2012-03-06 17:52:00,8605,"About 800K more than he should've been paid. What do you do though? IMO he's a key piece of this team moving forward and unlike many of his teammates actually plays with passion.  He'd have been a free agent July 1st and the crop is VERY thin this year. Someone would have overpaid for his services big time guaranteed.  Good timing for Grabo, nothing more.  Overall I feel good he's been locked up, I like him a lot. He's young and I believe we havn't seen his best yet."
673566,kickingfrog,2012-03-06 17:54:00,8333,This summer with so few forwards as UFAs he may have got even more. Supply and demand.
673567,Acountdeleted,2012-03-06 18:01:00,2562,Agree with kickingfrog. If the leafs didn't sign him for 5.5 someone else would have and the leafs would have been looking for another 2nd line centre that can score 25+ goals a year.
673569,Brettiop,2012-03-06 18:05:00,279,"Good deal IMO, a lot better then losing him for nothing...  Its a lot sure, but there aren't any free agents that could have taken his place for any less cash...And doesn't look like any Marlie is ready to be the #2 center just yet..."
673575,asdve23rveavwa,2012-03-06 18:38:00,2690,"  Yup, at least he looks like he gives a ""you know what""!  As for the amount, ridiculous like all sport salaries."
673586,12footspringbok,2012-03-06 19:12:00,459,I knew there would be some die hard leaf fans come out of the wood work defending and justifying this terrible deal.  Its always good for a laugh!
673597,Acountdeleted,2012-03-06 20:04:00,2562,  Lets play GM for a second. Between now and the begining of the start of the next regular season you have 5.5 million. What would you spend it on? I figure what is the sense of picking up a first line centre if you are going to lose your 30-30 second line centre.
673602,anders,2012-03-06 20:17:00,1168," Sure,  60 points a season isn't worth 5.5 million a year, not even close"
673605,12footspringbok,2012-03-06 20:23:00,459, I knew I shouldn't have posted in this thread....  If I was GM though I wouldn't be forever trying to put lipstick on a pig...  I would have completly gutted the team years ago and by now my team would have been full of awsome young players. Sounds like a crazy concept eh?  There will be no further discussion on my behalf...LOL

673619,jedimaster,2012-03-06 21:30:00,3472,"Reality is the cap is going to go up, I am sure burke knows that. 5.5 mil a year is worth alot less now than it was 3 years when most of those people in that list signed there deals. Not to mention after the cap goes up even more. Who knows what the new CBA will look like but I have faith that burke has a pretty good idea.  At the very least Grabo is still movable at 5.5. Just look at some of the flakes out there... I think Gomez was mentioned. Besides the biggest point was made above. If he just walks for nothing in the summer we are much better paying an extra 500-800k per year for him than what he is worth. I think 5x5 would have been a good deal. Grabo does lose the puck a fair bit, but he digs hard in the dirty places and isn't afraid of anyone, including chara. Remember the stunner he got from chara and staggered back to get the winner? He reminds me of Tucker with more skill, or Gilmour but not as good. He is that type of player, small, gritty, and CAN score.  I like Grabovski on my team."
