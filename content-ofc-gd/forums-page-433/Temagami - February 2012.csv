673128,Whopper,2012-03-05 02:02:00,2174,So that's what winter is supposed to look like  Looks and sounds like a good time was had by all
673170,SRT8 smoker craft,2012-03-05 06:41:00,1107,Great report guys
673224,bigbuck,2012-03-05 14:49:00,2449,Great report!!! That kind of adventure makes me want to try my hand at ice fishing.
673226,BillM,2012-03-05 14:52:00,17367,"Wayne, after looking at those Bahama pics, I think you got the short end of the stick in that deal!"
673245,irishfield,2012-03-05 15:54:00,26272,Her trip was probably cheaper too Bill! $900 in airfare thanks to it being reading week. Any other time she probably could have done return for $550. She managed to pay for one night out for dinner and even that was a fight.... and they deep sea fished or snorkelled for lobster every day !
673432,lovetofish,2012-03-06 02:32:00,500,Great report guys!!!
673839,Meegs,2012-03-07 13:41:00,249,good job guys!   nice pictures and thanks for the read!
672211,tonyb,2012-03-02 17:20:00,1637,"Looks like a great get together with the lads.  That's quite the Laker Wayne, either it was very aggressive or you're maybe getting old and slow on the hooksets if it had time to eat both your lures  Great pictures everyone"
672221,limeyangler,2012-03-02 17:56:00,5204,WOW...a real 'who's who' of OFC report with a couple of GIANT lakers...thanks for that Wayne...great report!
672223,Pondo,2012-03-02 18:03:00,36,Some nice hog lakers in that report.  Looks like it was fun.  Andy with a little crotch cover  hahaha!  That's not what Andy calls them.  Thanks for the report and pics.
672225,Terry,2012-03-02 18:11:00,14456, I had never heard them called that before...but everyone knew what he was talking about.....LOL
672236,fishindevil,2012-03-02 18:36:00,6254,great trip boys !!!   and some awesome fish too boot !!! nice big tanker of a laker wayne
672245,Leecher,2012-03-02 19:01:00,7832,Some great looking fishes in that report   Thanks Wayne for taking the time Congrats on the bruiser
672247,irishfield,2012-03-02 19:16:00,26272, I set the hook as soon as he grabbed it Tony and probably even before as I yanked when the lines crossed on the finder! Considering he spooled me over 10 times.. he had no problem going up and grabbing the spoon that was only 5 feet up from my jig! Was over 25 minutes getting that fella in...  Thanks everyone for the comments.. we never have fun up there Spiel.. you know that!! lol
672250,BillM,2012-03-02 19:24:00,17367,"Wayne, what did you get that giant cow on?  Big muskie tube?"
672252,solopaddler,2012-03-02 19:30:00,8605,"Amazing fish Wayne, wow! What'd you use to catch the beast?"
672253,irishfield,2012-03-02 19:31:00,26272,"1/8th ounce jig with a little white grub on Bill. Not that it really matters. When the big ones swim though, out of nowhere, they always seem to be just grabbing ""food"". It grabbed my jig... then went and grabbed my williams 5 or 6 feet above it. Other years it's been my big musky tube or a tiny bait. I think they just swim around with their yaps open inhaling anything they can find."
672297,spincast,2012-03-02 22:25:00,3279,Nice. Very nice. What a bruiser there Wayne
672309,FishAbout,2012-03-02 22:55:00,106,Very nice fish. Looks like you guys had good weather also.
672310,irishfield,2012-03-02 22:57:00,26272,"Weather.. although Lloyd loved it, I and the sleds hated it. Too many days near or above zero making you sweat, get the chills etc. Give me -10 to -15C anytime when bundled and running, drilling, etc. Didn't miss the usual morning -32C temps for this period of February though..."
672312,Terry,2012-03-02 23:12:00,14456,"yeah I didn't use a heater all week till we had the above zero day, the wet and wind got me cold so I fired it up to warm up"
672317,misfish,2012-03-02 23:36:00,29133,Great fishing report and fish.
672359,Rod Caster,2012-03-03 01:06:00,5784," I must be fishing the wrong spots for lakers haha. Great report Wayne, sounds like it was good time for all."
672361,irishfield,2012-03-03 01:09:00,26272," The ""bottom dwellers"" are finicky as hell. You can get them to follow, but it takes a long time to find the right bait to get a strike. The big cruisers.. 9 times out of 10 when they light up your screen they already have your bait lined up with their mouth.. no matter what you have on!"
672367,Terry,2012-03-03 01:14:00,14456,unless a white fish goes for your bait at the same time then that big red thing on your screen runs right by your bait and grabs the small black line (whitfeish) moving up to your bait
672377,irishfield,2012-03-03 01:24:00,26272,"Wish you'd had the underwater camera going on record for that one. Big fish eats little (22"") fish and swims away happy!!"
672411,TDunn,2012-03-03 02:00:00,680,Nice report! Thats a tank of a laker too!  TDunn
672416,irishfield,2012-03-03 02:06:00,26272,Well next year I'm gonna give this some more thought and maybe see a shrink as well... while I was up freezing my nads with the lads.. Leah was off doing this visiting her cousin in Marsh Harbour Bahamas. Triple header. A strawberry Grouper.. a Heinz and a shrimp! I could have been deep sea fishing every day..... for free!
672420,LeXXington,2012-03-03 02:09:00,1928,"Thanks Wayne for inviting me up.  It was an amazing trip with a great group. My first laker through the ICE was a big plus  Again LLoyd put on a fish clinic,    can't say enough about how much Lloyd knows about fishing and catching fish.   And the storm that was not suppose to happen.      The day after the storm.. freezing temperatures and not a sole around.. Ok us and 2 fellows who dropped by to say hi  "
672422,irishfield,2012-03-03 02:12:00,26272, Yah one tard with a ticket book and his young fella that booked a charter with Lloyd! LOL $110 bucks for moving 50 feet without a helmut on!  You were a great addition to the expedition Paul. Welcome any time!!
672692,Moosebunk,2012-03-03 17:31:00,3970,"Thanks to Wayne for the invites year after year.  It was my pleasure to finally get the chance to join he and the lads up on Temagami.  It's true Wayne did a Bravo repair.  Those snowmobiles are most times indestructible but, after summer storage this year the fuel primer was crappin' out and later finally jammed up after a wet day run went real cold and it must have frozen up then broke.  This actually ended up causing extra gas through to the carb and running the sled rich.  There were times when riding the Bravo must have been overheating and wanted to shut down.  Telling Wayne about it, his curiosity got the better of him and he soon back at the cottage had the primer disconnected and repaired with a new part (rubber washer for the faucet) he had around his place.  It was awesome... Just one of those many things Wayne does which makes him so cool.  Nicely done bud!  With the primer repaired, the snowmobile of course was back to starting with 1 or 2 pulls as opposed to 10-20, and it didn't run rich anymore.  Next year I'll be sure to get it a tune-up cause it hasn't had one in a few years.  Chain case & carbs cleaning, maybe new carbides and sliders.  Love the Bravo, although after about 250-300 miles put on it in a little over a week, my back was a knotted up and tired mess when getting home.  The snowmobiling in the Near North is ridiculously awesome!  Great meeting Lloyd, Terry, Paul and Andy.  Four guys who LOVE to fish and laugh.  My 3 full days fishing there was kind of tough.  Excluding the short afternoon Day 1... when showing up and nabbing one little laker on a set line, Day 2 I marked two fish all day despite moving a dozen times and hand drilling two dozen holes.  It had been a slow day for all with different weather fronts coming through all day.  Day 3 I lost two fish in a promising area which a few years ago I found and vowed to return to ""IF"" ever visiting Temagami again.  Overall, it was an OK day for everyone, until making the mistake of leaving fish to find different fish in a nearby backlake.  Day 4 the lads took us newbies to a new area where I picked up 4 lakers in the morning then later that day after moving through the snowstorm picked up two more closer to home.  Temagami has always been a very tough lake to fish for me, this year was no different, yet knowing that fish like Wayne's and Lloyd's could be caught at any time, it keeps ya pushing to find those big lakers.  Lloyd and Andy surely know their stuff.  I appreciated Andy's short time demonstrating some whitey tactics I now have to get out and try at some point.  Lloyd be an ole Ottawa valley boy, it was great talking about haunts and fishing around home here.  Best laugh I had... well, ya had to be there, but it was after Terry said something nutty about beer taps on the dashboard and Wayne just piped up with a ""HE WINS.""  This winter fishing had been limited but I've mostly stuck to lakers so far with some different levels of success on some very different waters.  For the time, I'm loving when these fish are active and just lay such quick and reckless chase to pretty much any baits offered.  When the crazy work schedule settles down I'll hope to pop up a short winter laker fishing report."
673119,irishfield,2012-03-05 01:18:00,26272,Great havin you there Bunker... you get any good pictures??
672050,irishfield,2012-03-02 02:48:00,26272,"This years trip took a lot of planning and some hair pulling for more than a few of us. I started with seeing what dates Terry could get off work and we decided to go weekend to weekend, so we could rotate guys in that couldn't do the full week. A month before D Day Terry had a devistating occurance that had him telling me he was out of the trip at this point, but I kept his spot open no different than they've done for me many times over the last year and a half. In the end Terry could ride up with me, but needed to be home for the following Saturday afternoon. We figured that one out toooo.  So Friday Terry and I headed for Temagami and arrived to 8"" of fresh wet snow and not a single track on the lake. We unloaded my sled and both ran out to camp and drilled a hole to check ice thickness. 22"".. good for everyone to park at the dock. We then proceeded to pack a parking area with the sled and a couple ""tire"" tracks to town. Reloaded the sled, threw the truck in 4 wheel drive and turned off the traction control. Was a tough run while grading a trail with the trailer axles, but we made it and then continued to go round and round for 10 minutes to pack the snow some more for everyone else.  Lloyd and his brother arrived a couple hours later in seperate vehicles. Lloyd put his trailer on Ralph's jeep and they both made it out. Supper and laughs and we fished Saturday, Sunday and Ralph went home Monday am. We then went out fishing Monday and Tuesday.. and about 2 PM Bunk called me from North Bay. ""Be there in about 2 hours"".. well he was fishing beside us in an hour and 5 minutes! Paul arrived about 4 pm and we got him moved into camp. Fishing Wed, Thur, Friday with Andy showing up to wake us up at 5:50.. not able to find the ramp to the lake or path to our camp. Drew went to get him with his truck and Andy made it out in his Civic to join us for the rest of the weekend. Of course it snowed like hell on Friday night and it was anything but fun getting that car back off the lake in the morning so Terry could take it back home to get to his appointment. Once that was done.. although Andy kept saying ""why do you guys go so far to fish.. there's a life time of structure right off the dock"" he really seemed to enjoy his day once we got 27 miles from home! LOL  Bunk headed for home on Saturday to give his wife a break from some sick kids and Paul and Lloyd headed home 6am Sunday. Andy and I took our time, cleaned the place up... winterized the drains and headed for shore at about 9am. Uneventful ride home and another trip in the books.  Thanks for the laughs guys!    Terry and I pack light! lol    Terry on the phone... ""Yes Lloyd, we've done all the work.. unloaded a sled.. drove out.. checked the ice thickness.. packed a parking lot.. packed a road.. gone back to town.. reloaded the sled.. drove out grading a ""road"" with the trailer axles.. shovelled the stairs.. shovelled the deck.. sure just drive out and have a beer"" !!  (Disclaimer: We're fine with that.. Lloyd does all the shopping and cooking!)    320 km to Temagami and another 55 in front of the dock. I'm dizzy.. let me out!    Great getting everything right to the island.    So much for taking the glass out of the rail making the snow blow away!    Lloyd unloading his sled.     Ralph, Lloyd's brother, draws first blood Saturday am.    Me with the next..    Lots of fish not worthy of ""history"" and then it was supper time. $92 for 4 T-Bones the size of plates. Seperate plate for the veggies!    Sunday off to a great start. Lloyd a fish.. then Terry a fish.. and I hadn't maked a fish in a couple hours when this big red streak enters the screen.      It grabbed one bait.. I set the hook and then he grabbed the other spoon. I now had a reel screaming monster on two lines. That was short lived when I burned one off on the burner. I kept calling for help on the 2 way and after about 20 minutes I had it below the hole and was struggling to get his head turned up thru 20"" of ice, but finally did. Took a self timer shot just as Lloyd screamed up on his sled. He now knows it does 72 mph!    Thanks for getting me a decent shot of this bruiser Lloyd! 38"" long.. solid and nicely over 20 pounds.    40 minutes later I've moved 5 miles further from Lloyd.. now about 7 miles apart. I now know my old sled with do 64mph! Another nice fish.    Terry with a nice Whitefish to finish the day off!    And another great winter sunset.    Terry starts the next day off making 3 in a row not skunked on the big lake!    Bunk with a Laker to start out and Lloyd with a couple more respectable fish!        Lloyd spooning with his old buddy Ted again !    I was leary of Paul (Lexxington) bringing a 4 wheeler.. but he did well keeping up with us even in 8"" of wet snow. In this shot we're about 35 miles from camp. Good thing he had a reserve tank getting home!    Moosebunk with his trusty 250 Bravo! Even trustier after I fixed it the night before!  ;D    Bunk and Terry browsing maps.    Paul and Lloyd drinking beer..    Andy with a little crotch cover. Great to see the lake is naturally reproducing so well.    Andy and Bunk discussing technique while the line screams off Bunks reel.     Bunk with a nice dark Laker.    Paul happy as hell with a line screamer he pulled up to make his trip!!  "
