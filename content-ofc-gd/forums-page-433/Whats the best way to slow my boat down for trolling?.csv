673411,Radnine,2012-03-06 01:20:00,1538," Do you have an electric trolling motor? If yes, you can troll with it. My main motor (a 60 HP 4/stroke) trolls down to about 2 MPH on a calm day, which I feel is too fast for walleye. I drop the electric and troll with it then use the main as a rudder. I have an on-board charger and can usually go an entire weekend on one charge. Jim"

673421,Ron,2012-03-06 01:51:00,1683,"I have a 17.5 ft Lund Outfitter with a 90 Yamaha. When I am trolling for walleye on Quinte in the Fall, I put 2 cloth grocery bags out, one off of each front cleat. This will put my trolling speed down to .7 - .8 mph. The length of rope is long enough for me to reach over from the console to pick them out of the water. If you put one out on each side of the boat from the front cleats, you will still have quick responsive steering when required. Experience tells me by placing the trolling socks or cloth bags out from the stern cleats, the prop wash gets put into the bags and causes the boat to not respond to turning . The grocery bags take up no room, in fact they become useful when not used as speed control. On our back country trips, they work great for hauling water to put out our fire from the shore lunch. I also use them to store my anchor and rope."
673425,kickingfrog,2012-03-06 02:10:00,8333,Those bags hold up eh? I would have never thought they'd be durable enough. Always something to learn. I wonder if I can find my receipt from three years ago on a couple of used drift socks?

673490,doubleheader,2012-03-06 13:27:00,497,"I'm guessing you're trying to get into the crankbait zone, 1.6-2mph? You probably troll down to about 2.5 now? Anyhow, sometimes just the simplest of things can help. I think someone mentioned troll in to the wind. If you have a windshield close it when going into the wind. Another thing is don't troll in a straight line- zig zag some. It will not only help slow down the inside bait but trigger strikes. If you have auto trim, try playing with your trim adjust. The fourth option would be to drag something. Drop your bow mount motor if is have one, if not drag something, bags, windsock, etc. I would add a kicker before adding a trolling plate. If all those fail find one of those split open Crestliners, they're all over the lake, tie him on and drag him around."

I made a tapered nylon sack about 3 feet long that attaches securely around the plastic pail ""ring"", tapers from full size to about a 6"" opening. It goes overboard on the opposite side of the downrigger when I'm alone, keeps the boat running straight and helps in slowing it down.  I'm sure you can make the same with something like an Ikea bag.  If it works, you have accomplished something on the cheap."

Last year Shane loaned me a drift sock to try, what a difference, I can get out there and fish when the lake is rough but still drift slow enough to pound the walleye. Made a huge difference for me in the number of walleye I can put in the boat and now I actually prefer to get out there when there is a good wind blowing where before I'd be moving too fast to catch anything but those stupid muskie. Fun to catch but not on 6 lb test line with no leader in 25k winds."

673105,BillM,2012-03-05 00:30:00,17367, If you do a lot of trolling the kicker is definitely worth it..  Think of all those low rpm hours you'll keep off the main motor..
673123,Sinker,2012-03-05 01:38:00,8692,the kicker can also save your   if you run into trouble with the main engine.  S.
673180,GYPSY400,2012-03-05 09:53:00,191, That would make for faster trolling speeds in theory.. More distance travelled per prop revolution.
673182,Billy Bob,2012-03-05 10:53:00,5865, BIG waste of money IMHO....my buddy has a 115hp Yammy and it trolls down very nice and there is no need for a kicker....and if you maintain your big engine it will outlast you.

673366,Sinker,2012-03-05 23:24:00,8692,"IMO, if you are primarily a troller, a kicker is a solid investment.  Why put all the hours on your main motor?  Why pay more than double to maintain a big motor, when you can maintain a kicker for MUCH cheaper.  Think about it. Over the course of 10 years, you will rack up the hours on your main motor. i don't care what you say, that's not good for an outboard. Put the hours on your kicker, pay less for the engine, and pay less to maintain it, and also have a plan B if the main motor has a hiccup.  Seems like a smart plan to me. I wish I had a kicker on mine!!!  S."
673369,Big Cliff,2012-03-05 23:27:00,6899," Well, I haven't had a heart attack in over 60 years but that doesn't mean it won't happen tomorrow. Towing a dingy behind you would slow you would slow you down enough to troll for walleye  But what are you going to use to get the dingy back to shore? Oh, wait, a kicker motor! Why not just leave the dingy at home and take the kicker motor"
673371,Billy Bob,2012-03-05 23:33:00,5865," Sinker, experience has told me otherwise........my big motor is going to be 27 years old at the end of this month and I have no issues with it....my buddies motor has to be 10-12 years old and again not issues with it....neither has a kicker and niether boat has transom problems or engine problems and both boats troll right down.....one is a 2 stroke and one is a 4 stroke....  40 years ago outboards were a pain in the   to keep running, etc....but the last 25 years or so they have been built much better, last a LOT longer and have a LOT less problems all while being much more dependable....I am only speaking from experience.....but if you have a extra 3-4k to throw around and want to add the extra weight on the back of your transom....go for it.....someday someone down the line will thank you when you sell that kicker at a discounted rate."

I have looked at those prop plates and drift socks they both seem to have there down sides though, the best way would be a second small engine but that is would take a large chunk of coin. Would drift socks work or would they cause issues.  any feed back would be welcome. thanks."
672257,Raf,2012-03-02 20:18:00,3495,drift socks work  cheapest approach is to tie off 1 or 2 5 gallons pails off the rear.  just keep an eye on the ropes around the prop if you stop and re-start.
672260,zamboniwaterboy,2012-03-02 20:29:00,126,"Have you tried back trolling?  I started to use drift socks and they are easier to handle than the pails.  I use them on  20' boat 175hp I/0, slow me from 3.5mph to 1.8mph on GPS."
672261,Live2fish85,2012-03-02 20:33:00,1633,Yea go with drift socks. Or as Raf said the pails or as I have used my wifes re-usable grocery bags. They won't cause any damage to your boat though.
672264,Pigeontroller,2012-03-02 21:01:00,2793,Every spring I struggle to slow my boat down enough for early Browns and Kings...Finally last year I tied a pail off one corner...Its that easy. Keep the rope short so that the pail is right off the corner and there is 0 chance of a rope-propeller encounter. One pail is adequate to slow my 16 footer w/ F90 Yamaha to well under 2 mph.
672267,irishfield,2012-03-02 21:16:00,26272,"Pail off each FRONT side cleat, along side the boat, and you'll forget there even there.. until you try to get it up on plane going home that is!  I just used a couple pool chlorine buckets.. drill a hole on each side where the handle goes. Take a rope with 4 or 6 strands and tie a knot in the rope about 2 feet up. Seperate the rope into two runs and tie each thru the bucket hole. One loop at the other end of about 6 feet of rope and drop over the front bow side cleats."
672274,Sinker,2012-03-02 21:41:00,8692,"I run mine off the front side cleats as well. Once you wrap a good fish in your stern buckets, you will start to look for a better way.   S."
