I probably do it that way because the spinning reels I used as a kid had the handles on the left hand side.

673202,lew,2012-03-05 13:48:00,12766,It's just like what side of a bicycle should a person climb on or off. There's no right or wrong hand to crank a reel or hold a rod with.  Just do whatever feels best.
673214,rufus,2012-03-05 14:26:00,267,"When I bought my first spinning reel back in the '60's (yes, I am dating myself!) it actually came with instructions and a pitch as to why in the interest of efficiency one should learn to cast without switching hands. prior to that of course everyone switched as just about all handles were on the right. Switching was the natural way to fish. Not switching was a new method that had to be learned.  I thought that was dumb of course and continue to switch to this day  Do what ever feels good!"

But i find it awkward, but the reason I do it, is because I have a lot better rod control with my right hand. I can't seem to be able to get used to jerk-pause, jerk-pause using my left hand and it seems natural with my right hand."
673264,BillM,2012-03-05 17:09:00,17367,It's so funny how comfortable you feel depending on the setup..  I can't imagine fishing a baitcaster with my left hand on the reel handle..  Walking the dog topwaters with my left hand wrapped around the reel and my right hand on the handle.  Then the other end of the spectrum..  Spinning setup fishing for brookies and using a 'pause jerk pause' motion with my left hand on the handle and my right hand on the reel seat/rod.  Silly when you think about it!
673271,Harrison,2012-03-05 17:35:00,2202,"Strong arm should be on the rod.  More power, better aim.  Using the wrong hand on the reel feels like you are writing with the wrong hand, it takes practice.  I switched over quite a few years ago now.  With some practice I noticed a huge difference.  For the first while I only pitched and flipped left handed and casted right.  Now it is all left.  Most guys like KVD, never switched because back in the day you could only really get right hand baitcasters. Sometimes it is hard to teach an old dog new.... you know...  Those that switch hands after each cast, pitch, flip are probably very comfortable doing it, but for myself switching from right to left was well worth it.  For what it's worth."
673284,asdve23rveavwa,2012-03-05 19:21:00,2690,"Left all the way, for the reasons stated by many others AND the fact that it just feels right...er...um.....left"
673289,kickingfrog,2012-03-05 19:48:00,8333,"Do you fish on the left or right side of the boat?  I'm lefthanded. And reel with my right hand for both. I get to use my dominant hand on the tiller, face the left (port) side of the boat. My non-dominant right hand (not my normal rod hand) surely works as good as a rod holder while trolling. l can set the hook by rotating my upper body and arm using my back muscles. Most people have stronger upper back muscles, then chest muscles.  Funny how something that can seem as simple as fishing can be done so many different ways that are all so obvious to the individual, but completely different from the next person."
673746,Roe Bag,2012-03-07 03:20:00,246,I was going to see what kind of deals were around at either the Bass Pro Fishing Classic or the Sportsmens Show but I think I'll borrow a couple and see how things shake out. I think I would prefer working the rod with my dominant hand. That's the way I work my jerk baits and any jigging (spinning) so I'm thinking left hand retrieve but I want to be sure before I fork out the coin. Appreciate your thoughts guys. Thanks for the help.
673750,GBW,2012-03-07 03:30:00,8460,"I'm a lefty and I had about 3 or 4 baitcasters that were a right hand crank.  the second I tried and left hand crank all those reels went up for sale.  just saying...  I crank on a spinning with my left, I can play with my kids rods that crank on the right and even though I'm a lefty; casting with my right hand holding the rod feels better and I get the power cranking a fish in the boat with my left (strong hand?) vs. the switch over that I did in the past.  *edit to add*  being a lefty I grab a fish with my left hand 95% of the time or more so holding the rod in my right and giving my cranking hand free play to grab the fish felt better too."
673755,kickingfrog,2012-03-07 03:38:00,8333,"Most of us are not using winches for reels. You don't crank a fish in with the reel, you recover the line with it. The rod moves the line. Not saying someone is ""wrong"" for doing things differently then convention, but sometimes the reasoning for why things are done a particular way has flaws."

Years ago when I fished spin cast outfits I cast with my right, switched the rod over to my left hand and retrieved with my right. I notice that several pro bass fishermen switch hands when using a baitcaster. Cast with the right. Switch hands and reel with the right. Yet if they pick up a spinning outfit, they cast with their right and retrieve with their left. Which way do you find more comfortable?"

I'm actually really proud to be able to cast and pitch with my left and use RH reels.  Find a few friends with both LH and RH reels and try it first. No point in dishing out money to find that you need to switch the handle side.  Here's a couple of articles that I think might help others in learning to cast with your left.  Part1 Part2"

On the original thread at almost 62 I learned on baitcasters in the late 50's when switching was the norm, do it without even thinking. In the 60's it was common to see oldtimers with the new on the market open face spinning reels, cast with the right hand, switch and reel in with the reel ON TOP CRANKIN BACKWARDS  it was strange to them to reel with the left hand"

672873,Dabluz,2012-03-04 01:52:00,701,"There are many reasons why many baitcasters have the handle on the right side.  It started long ago with level wind reels.  A level wind reel with the handle on the right means that the main bearing that supports the spool is on the left side.  When casting in the old days, we always have a casting motion like pitching a baseball and most fishermen were right handed.  At the end of the cast, the reel ended up with the handles on top and the spool would pivot on the main bearing.  Bearings in those days were mostly hard semi-precious gems on which the spool would pivot.  Just like the jewel movements in a watch.  Since most fishermen were right handed, many more reels were made for them.  There were some companies who made level wind reels for lefties but as you can imagine, the cost of making them was increased to.  Level wind reels evolved over time and the main bearing actually became a roller ball bearing.  When the button was pushed to disengage the spool so that casting could be accomplished, the same casting motion was used (like pitching a baseball) and the handle of the reel would end up on top with the spool vertical and spinning on the main bearing.  If the handle was on the left side, the rod which is in the right hand could not be easily twisted so that the handles on the reel were on top and the spool was vertical.  The side without the handle allowed easy access for cleaning and lubricating the bearing.  I see lots of baitcasters casting and not many of them twist their wrist a little bit to let the spool spin on the main bearing.  For these anglers, the weight of the spool is on both bearings (left and right side) because the spool is horizontal.  If these fishermen would turn the reel so that the spool was vertical, they would suddenly realize that casting distance will increase quite a bit.  Yes, modern reels now have great bearings on each end of the spool and the gearing mechanism that cranks the spool now disengages completely in mode (free spooling), there is still the fact that 2 bearings create more friction than 1 bearing.  Another reason why the handle is more often on the right hand side of the reel and the reel is called a right handed reel is due to the fact that a right handed person can turn the handle of a reel much faster with his right hand than with his left hand.  For a pro, this means that his lure can come back to the boat much faster and therefore he can accomplish a few more casts by the end of the day.  Casting with one hand means that you have to hold the rod on the handle behind the reel.  After the cast, you have to move your hand further up the rod to get to the balance point where the tip of the rod and the end of the handle are about the same weight.  The reel is now in the palm of the hand and you can feel every little tic at the end of the line.  If a fish bites, you can immediately yank back hard with the handle under your arm or stuck in the pit of your stomach.  You can even add your reeling hand to strike even harder.  If you hand is on the handle behind the reel, you lose a bit of power in your strike.  Imagine a whole day of casting with the right arm, holding the rod against the resistance of the lure with the right arm and then casting again.  Your right arm gets tired....especially when their is more weight at the tip of the rod than at the end of the handle.  If that is not a problem for you....then I see no reason for having the handles on the right.  You can even palm the reel in your right hand and cast with 2 hands.  I can't do this anymore.  My right elbow has taken too much punishment over the years.  I now cast with both arms, I palm the reel in my left hand and reel with the right hand.  I can reel much faster with my right hand.  However for a spinning outfit, it's the reverse.  For very deep saltwater ice fishing, I even had to switch the handle on my big spinning reel so that I could hold the rod with my left arm.  I have just as many baitcasters with handles on the left as those on the right.  The left handed ones are getting almost no fishing time even though there was a time when I preferred them."
672876,danc,2012-03-04 02:00:00,4677, But which hand do you use to hold the pliars with when you yank out a molar??
672888,rufus,2012-03-04 02:53:00,267,The first reel I ever bought when I was a kid decades ago was a Shakespeare bait casting reel with the handle on the right. The next was a spin cast with the handle on the right - that was the only way they came. When the time came to buy a spinning reel they all seemed to have the handle on the left - didn't seem right - so I ended up buying a Garcia Mitchell 301 with the handle on the right. Every reel I have bought since has had the handle on the right. I cast and switch hands and don't even think about it.  The funny thing is that I do many things left handed naturally as I am pretty much ambidextrous  but reeling with the left hand feels foreign.
672889,Raf,2012-03-04 02:56:00,3495,"go with whatever's more comfortable.  if there both equally comfortable, do yourself a favour and get used to right-hand retrieve as you will have many more options for reels.  says the left hand retrieve baitcaster."
672901,John Bacon,2012-03-04 03:48:00,3277,"I hold the rod in my left hand and reel with my right for both bait casting and spinning.  I actually use two hands to cast but I consider it casting left handed because my left hand always holds the rod in the same place while I only place my right hand on the rod for the cast.  Oddly, I used to use cast right handed and use a one handed cast; in my lates teens and early twenties I switched to a two handed left hand cast. I have always reeled with my right hand and used to hold spinning reels upside down and reel backwards.  I write left handed, through and curls right handed, and can do most other tasks with either hand."
672905,Sinker,2012-03-04 04:39:00,8692,"I cast and reel with my right. Switch hands every time. It just happens, and I know I can keep up with the ""other guys"" who cast left, reel right without the switch. I don't even know it happens.  S."
672925,Gregoire,2012-03-04 12:34:00,1397,"I agree with Raf. My first baitcaster was a righty but that seemed weird so I switched to a lefty retrieve. I wish I was a righty as a musky angler as it seems my choice in reels, especially for certain applications, are limited. As far as being able to reel faster with your right vs your left I think that is bullocks. I know in the summer when salmon fishing I get very tired reeling in with my right and tire out fighting the fish quicker than I think I should. So much so that I have considered buying my own rods and reels to use on my buddies boat."
672926,hirk,2012-03-04 13:00:00,571,"Dabluz is right,what he was trying to say was you can reel faster with good control with your dominate hand which is the best way to discover is you should buy a left or right. Put each one in your hand and crank fast, you will instantly know if your left or right because of the small turning radius, the hand with better fine motor control will feel better. He was also right about palming the reel Vs fishing behind it, huge difference in both comfort and control."
