The huts were on fish as this was their 4th location this season.  with 3 out of 4 of us fishing pretty regular all week-end we caught some fish despite the weather this week-end.  Caught 2 nice white fish 2 1/2 and 3 lbs. 2 nice walleye both in the slot and plenty of perch(we stopped counting.  Would definitely recomend this outfitter.  No unexpected charges (we were given a free upgrade to an 8 man hut) all minnows were supplied free of charge, they checked on us 3 times a day and offered to take us out to their day hut if we were unhappy with our results.  No surprises we all caught fish and a good time was had by all.  We asked about next year as we were leaving...they are already booked for all of January"
