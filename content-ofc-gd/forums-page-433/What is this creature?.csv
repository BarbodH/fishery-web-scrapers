674183,Mr Twister,2012-03-08 13:37:00,71,I hope he can shed some light to this issue!!  Thanks every one for your efforts  Twister
673495,Mr Twister,2012-03-06 14:00:00,71,Hey guys just very curious to know what the heck is this parisite found in some Herring as I have not seen this before?  I can't find anything close to this in some of the fresh water game fish sites on the net.  What do you think!  Twister  
673496,NAW,2012-03-06 14:11:00,4022,What lake did you catch the Herring in?  I've never seen anything like that before.
673497,Gerritt,2012-03-06 14:11:00,6129,Looks like some sort of parasitic worm... which one though...??
673501,Roy,2012-03-06 14:33:00,13728,In the meat or stomach contents?
673515,Mr Twister,2012-03-06 15:08:00,71,"Hey Roy,it was in the fillets(Meat)*"
673518,HTHM,2012-03-06 15:12:00,4082,The MNR might be a good place to ask. They may even want to be aware of the possible problem.
673529,tonyb,2012-03-06 16:08:00,1637,"Looks like Yellow Grub Fish Parasite...common and safe to eat once cooked.  In fact, nearly all parasites found in fish aren't harmful to humans once cooked.  It's just getting past the thought for most..."
673552,Fisherman,2012-03-06 17:31:00,7201,"Going by the description and size of the Yellow Grub, 1/4 inch long, and the initial picture where it shows the length against the first segment of a finger about one inch long, I don't think it's the same grub type."
673562,Mr Twister,2012-03-06 17:46:00,71,"I would have to agree with Fisherman as it was exactly 1""in in lenght if that helps the cause!"
673570,Roy,2012-03-06 18:05:00,13728,My first thought was that it was a grub the same as you'd find in perch but the largest I've ever seen were a tenth of the size of the one pictured above.
673572,Rod Caster,2012-03-06 18:15:00,5784,"I've seen them in herring in Nipissing before. I'll see 5-10 in each fillet... Not appetizing. I can't identify it though, sorry, a biologist would be the person to ask."
673579,Mr Twister,2012-03-06 18:50:00,71,Thats where the Herring/Cisco came from but would really like to know what exactly it is named.....Tks
673585,richyb,2012-03-06 19:04:00,774,""" The 'herring worm' is often found in herring, mackerel, whiting and blue whiting, but it also occurs in many other species. Its scientific name is Anisakis simplex. It grows up to 2 cm long in fish, is almost colourless, and is found tightly coiled and encased in the guts and flesh, sometimes in considerable numbers, particularly in the belly flaps. Anisakis can migrate from guts to flesh in fish left ungutted after capture, notably in herring, mackerel and blue whiting""  http://www.fao.org/wairdocs/tan/x5951e/x5951e01.htm   Could that be it ?"
673590,Mr Twister,2012-03-06 19:18:00,71,It just does not look like what I posted does it?
673623,Fisherman,2012-03-06 21:44:00,7201, I sure hope it isn't. That's nasty .. http://www.google.ca...WL3PzmA&cad=rja
673633,Live2fish85,2012-03-06 22:00:00,1633,What lake is it from?
673635,jedimaster,2012-03-06 22:08:00,3472,"I know a fish biologist, I'll shoot him a line and the picture and see if he knows..."
673654,Jer,2012-03-06 23:26:00,1426,"Looks just like a Gulp FishFry, I have just that colour..."
673686,gaspumper,2012-03-07 00:19:00,393,He said it came from Nipising.
673718,Live2fish85,2012-03-07 01:43:00,1633, Actually he didn't say that was where it came from he replied to another post saying it was from the lake mentioned. And I didn't read all the other post sorry.  As for the parasite I believe that is the parasite they are having trouble with on Nipising this year. I was reading about it in a magazine. They aren't harmfull as others mention most aren't when found in fish.
673723,Rod Caster,2012-03-07 01:54:00,5784,"  To my knowledge, the herring have had them for several years. I can't speak to prior.  I've heard of a few herring this year that were completely clean.  Thank god these things don't like walleye meat."
673763,Ron,2012-03-07 03:42:00,1683,"Berkley Gulp 1"" minnow fry, I guess you could call it a parasite as they are a royal pain to thread onto a micro jig head.  Cheers, Ron..."
673772,Live2fish85,2012-03-07 03:53:00,1633, That is a good thing walleye don't have them lol. I personally don't care if I see something while Im eating my fish I just look away and chew a bit faster lol.  The parasite I was reading about may have been different then this but it did look similar. I was looking for the article in my magazine but I can't find it.
673815,Mr Twister,2012-03-07 12:05:00,71,Yes it was Nipissing.............Bon Appetit
673883,jedimaster,2012-03-07 16:53:00,3472,My friend sent the photo to a benthic macroinvertebrate analyst for further review and identification.... Will post an update when I hear back.
