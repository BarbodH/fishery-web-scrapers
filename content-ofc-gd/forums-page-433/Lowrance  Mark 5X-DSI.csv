674051,brkygetr,2012-03-08 01:17:00,425,Anyone know where I can purchase one of these? Thinking about going to the 'Spring show' to pick one up but would like to get one closer (and support a local) if possible. Within 2 hours of Owen Sound would be great? Let me know.
674057,brkygetr,2012-03-08 01:30:00,425,"  Disregard folks...I was just  talking to a buddy and found some reviews that are less than adequate.. If there are any different opinions on a graph for under $500 that will last me as long as my 'Piranah' that is 10 years old let me know. NO color, greyscale and accurate in most conditions while under power, up to 35 mph."
