673742,Radnine,2012-03-07 03:16:00,1538," I couldn't have said this better myself. We have made a drinking game out of every time he mentions the old days just to make himself relevant (""I had 5 twenty goal scorers in Boston"" None of them would score 5 goals in today's NHL). I think that the entire CBC broadcast has become extremely over produced, but I am just plain tired of Don (and by association I suppose, Ron). Jim"
673916,walleyejigger,2012-03-07 18:37:00,876,"first time i've seen it, he's passionate of what he speaks, some dont like that, it's what he's paid for so be it. The fact that he ends most of his segments the way he did in this one shows me what kind of guy he really is.  IMO we need more people/segments on tv like this."
673983,bucktail,2012-03-07 21:50:00,1857,"I have no idea why Don hates Burke so much, but one thing is for sure . The Leafs are in there usual 12th in the east and Burke has had enough time for his ""plan"" to show results. He should have been fired as well."

I found myself tuning out on Cherry years ago, not sure if it was anything in particular or just his usual bluster. By all accounts from friends who know him, he's a really good guy in person but when he gets in front of the camera...  As for MacLean, I have no idea what's up with him, probably just gave up."
673365,Rod Caster,2012-03-05 23:14:00,5784,I didn't think anything special of it. It's Don Cherry; he's contraversial and opinionated. It's actually nice to see someone with a true opinion once in a while...there are a lot of bought people out there who just say words and have no real purpose.  He's no crazier than Howard Stern. Both guys are great entertainment but often spew Bull.  More Ontario players on an ontario team???....absolutely...duh!!! But this is not Toronto's main problem and it's nothing new. Everyone is looking for an excuse.  
673367,DRIFTER_016,2012-03-05 23:24:00,10439,Don Cherry is the Darryl Chronzy of hockey!!!!
673373,John,2012-03-05 23:37:00,2956,"  Ed Zachary! We all know it's Don Cherry. If ya don't like him, don't watch him. He tells it like (he thinks) it is. No surprise for me."
673381,davey buoy,2012-03-05 23:51:00,5505,Entertainment at it's finest.
673389,Whitespinnerbait,2012-03-06 00:04:00,2038,The next time i'm watching Coaches Corner and if Don Cherry mentions Bobby Orr.......I'm going to commit suicide right then and there!!   :wallbash:

673426,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2012-03-06 02:12:00,0,"don lost my respect a long time ago. his rants have gotten stranger and stranger over the years and the more he's gotten involved in politics, the less I like him."
673452,Sebastian,2012-03-06 03:36:00,208,"I like Don but that has nothing to do with winning. Its becoming like the Montreal Canadiens. Prefer a french speaking coach instead of a winning coach. It does not matter. Ontario players or not, the goal is winning games. Burke is fed up with Toronto media."
673456,Toronto_Angler,2012-03-06 03:56:00,698,I may not agree with a lot of what Don says..But I love him! He's one of the last left who speaks his mind and has passion for what he believes in and doesn't care about being politically correct. Also I find him entertaining and in the end watching sports is about being entertained. Also love the work he does to recognize the troops and emergency workers
673458,BillM,2012-03-06 04:08:00,17367,"He doesn't consider Nazem Kadri an 'Ontario' boy?  Been here since he was 4, played all his minor hockery here,  that's good enough for me!"
673459,Pigeontroller,2012-03-06 04:12:00,2793,No surprises on many of these opinions...Having the balls to speak your mind is fairly un-popular around here...
673465,Henricus,2012-03-06 05:45:00,118,"Like him or not, he has done very well for himself earning an incredible living at something he loves, not bad for somebody who dropped out of high school.  Agree with him or not, he tells it like it is and knows hockey better than most.  The NHL should listen to him once in a while.  No touch icing should have been gone years ago, something Don has been trying to get changed for an eternity.  He is also an advocate for changing the equipment so it doesn't look and feel like armor.  He is a great ambassador to the kids and watches a ton of minor hockey...he simply loves the game.  Incidentally, most goalies will stop 99 shots out of a hundred if they can see it and it's not tipped.  As a defenseman, knowing there is nobody else near, the best move is to let the goalie do his job.  The many shots that are deflected into the corner were going to be stopped anyway.  Don is ultra patriotic which is refreshing in a land so passive.  We should all be so grateful for our freedom.  By the way, he was coach of the year in the NHL as well as the AHL.  Just because you don't like him, doesn't mean he doesn't know what he is talking about.  Regarding Don's rant,  good for him - Burke is a moron.  If you don't think hockey is filled with politics you clearly have not experienced minor hockey from a parent's perspective.  Who has been Burke's coaches?  His buddies, that's who.  He has basically set up his buddies in one sweet deal after another.  Maybe Don didn't get Ron Wilson fired but hopefully he can get Burke fired.  In case you still haven't figured it out, I like him!"
673467,tonka-toy,2012-03-06 06:38:00,139,Could you expand a bit? I'd like to know your opinion. Agree or disagree gotta love Don.
673492,kickingfrog,2012-03-06 13:30:00,8333,"A few points on multiple posts:  The ""agree or disagree (or right or wrong) he speaks his mind"" position is interesting. Someone providing a counter to Don's position is also specking their mind.They've possibly consider the argument from more than one view point and don't respond emotionally to someone providing a different opinion.  A goalie may stop 99% of clear shots most of the time, but 100% of the ones deflected into the netting will never end up in the net all of the time.  Just because someone likes Don doesn't mean he knows what he's talking about.  If someone disagrees with Don they aren't as patriotic is another argument that provides no substance, but much traction amongst the masses."
673502,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2012-03-06 14:40:00,0," ironic because i recall some of my opinions being unpopular with you and the other members of the OFC ""good ol boys club""..."
673513,bubbles,2012-03-06 15:04:00,591,"I like Don, I appreciate people who tell it like it is.  He gets paid to tell eveyone his opinion, remember it's an opinion and he is entitled to it, just like you are.  The differnece is he gets paid to give his...... which tells me that more people are interested in hearing his opinion than yours or mine."
673519,asdve23rveavwa,2012-03-06 15:13:00,2690,"  That's why he gets paid the big bucks.  We all watched it, no?  Like I said, earlier, it's all about good tv.  Do I take it seriously, not very often"
673551,tonka-toy,2012-03-06 17:23:00,139,"I don't think your feelings about a tv personality says anthing about how patriotic you are.Like with don,I don't always  agree with your opinions but find your views often give me something to think about.I find this place full of people who ""speak their mind"" and have ""cherry-sized"" pairs."

673296,tb4me,2012-03-05 20:06:00,3295,"I have mixed feelings in regard to his rant. I believe he was right on the money but he went over the top. His point would have had more merit if he had of stayed calm..As for the youngster and his father that passed on in a horrific car crash, that's sad. I had about it earlier in the week on Sports net. What Don didn't share was the fact that the kid had just played a game where he scored his first Hat trick. What a sad sad deal there..Thought and prayers go out to the family....   <iframe width=""420"" height=""315"" src=""http://www.youtube.com/embed/iEQF0Pts4aY"" frameborder=""0"" allowfullscreen></iframe>"

673302,DRIFTER_016,2012-03-05 20:19:00,10439,When has Don ever been calm? And yes he is 100% right and now that it is totally out in the media maybe Burke will put some Ontario boys on the bench.
673304,kickingfrog,2012-03-05 20:26:00,8333,"I already made this statment:  ""Anybody foolish enough to pick hockey players based on their birth certificate instead of their ability, talent, effort and character, deserves the team that results from those decisions.""    Cherry can be entertaining in a car wreck sort of way, however, he has become a caricature of himself and there is very little balance provided. Ron used to provide some counter to Cherrys statements, but they have been together too long and are too ""buddy buddy""."
673305,solopaddler,2012-03-05 20:27:00,8605,I'm normally a big fan of Cherry's but that was way over the top.  I find it despicable that he'd use his position to publicly demean Burke because of whatever bizarre misguided vendetta he's harbouring against him.  His rant about Ontario players is ridiculous anyway. Burkes drafted a bunch of kids from ON.  In all the years I've been watching Cherry spout off on air I've never been more disgusted with him.
673307,Headhunter,2012-03-05 20:30:00,5703, I loved it! Best laugh I had all weekend! HH
673308,torco,2012-03-05 20:35:00,656,"In a lot of ways I do wonder about the roster make-up of the hockey club. A disproportionate amount of americans but I don't think its cynical,  Burke is trying to assemble a team that wins but perhaps he is misguided and due to his familiarity with US hockey programs shows a bias towards US players.  It would be nice to see more hometown players but only if they help the team win, this professional hockey and I will like any player that helps my team win, Loved Mats Sundin when he was a leaf."
673309,davey buoy,2012-03-05 20:35:00,5505,"I'm with you on that,he did what he had to. If someone(if it's true) went behind my back to get me fired,I'd be the same if not worse!"
673312,kickingfrog,2012-03-05 20:38:00,8333,"One of Don's windmills is players deflecting pucks that end up in their own team's net.  A couple of times a year he'll pull out the videio and show 5-6 pucks deflected past goalies, or into a guys own face. What he never shows is the 20-30 shots that are deflected EACH GAME into the corners or netting. And I guess no coach in the league has ever considered Don's point because the players all continue to deflect pucks. Of course Don thinks he is smarter then every coach in the league."
673314,kickingfrog,2012-03-05 20:44:00,8333," Do we know Burke went to the CBC to get Don ""fired""?  You think Burke is the type to not confront someone who he has an issue with?  And if he did:  If I want the drive-through window guy fired, I don't go to the drive-throw window guy. I go to his boss."
673315,davey buoy,2012-03-05 20:45:00,5505, If I'm not wrong did he not win a cup or two?
673318,kickingfrog,2012-03-05 20:48:00,8333,"No, he couldn't win a cup with Orr, Espo and the bunch. And his OHL record as a coach/ owner were atrocious."
673321,davey buoy,2012-03-05 20:56:00,5505,"Your right he didn't,With all his knowledge I must of just assumed so."
673324,kickingfrog,2012-03-05 21:09:00,8333,"Have you ever been in a room with a group of people and one blowhard? The more he talks, the more everyone realizes how little he knows."
673325,Toronto_Angler,2012-03-05 21:09:00,698,Don was commenting on Ron's interview earlier in the evening where Burke said that its tough to play against teams at home because the visitors have so many local players that want to do well in front of fans and family.
673327,davey buoy,2012-03-05 21:18:00,5505,I'm sure we could get a local boy or two during the summer for next year.Wouldn't that make everyone happy?
673331,tb4me,2012-03-05 21:23:00,3295,"This is why I posted this..I enjoy this sort of debate. Everyone I have spoken too has mixed emotions on this one. I myself having already posted my thoughts on his rant. I also believe he is right and wrong this time. Burke does indeed have Ontario boys on the Marlies..Here's the kicker. for all the Sens fans that say we have nothing in the cupboards as far as future goes, here is what Burke has done alone for us in the draft and thru deals. In all 3 drafts he has, since coming to Toronto, 10 of his 23 moves have been Ontario kids, Including Kadri, Percy, Mckeeg and Blacker to name a few. The only other Ontario boy I know of maybe the new kid signed at the deadline??? Carter Ashton. I honestly believe we do have to draft local. If we keep the farm system close, right on up to the big leagues. It would be much more cost effective for the kids coming up thru the ranks and be much cheaper in the long run for MLSE. My Aunt for example, She is a member of the Bulldogs alumni, she sponsors a kid from Kingston in the OHL to play here in Brantford. The kid lives with my aunt while he plays here. Imagine the financial burden put on the parents and the Pro teams signing him? Why not go local if your getting some of the best talent the world has to offer? Anyway ill look forward to the rest of your responses.."
673333,crappieperchhunter,2012-03-05 21:35:00,2582,Agree or disagree with me...but I have felt poor old Mr Cherry has been out of touch  for years now. Truthfully I don't watch alot of hockey anymore...but if I do have a game on and he comes on I use that time as a pee break or a chance to get on the PC and check out OFC and other things.  He should have been put out to pasture years ago.
673334,Pikeslayer,2012-03-05 21:39:00,1443,I actually feel sorry for the old man. The only thing worse than losing respect from your peers/fans is flushing your dignity down the toilet. I believe he is a couple of years past his best before date.
673335,blaque,2012-03-05 21:41:00,2419,Just watched it........It had a WWF feel to it.....I almost expected Randy Macho Man Savage and Rowdy Roddy Piper to walk onto the set and declare a cage match with  Burke. OOOOOOOH YEAAAAAA!!! it turned me right off to listening to what his actual point was. I have a hard time listening to tantrums!
673338,tb4me,2012-03-05 21:49:00,3295,This response is EXACTALLY what I thought most would say..If he had of kept his cool he would have been taken seriously.. Good point Blaque
673339,davey buoy,2012-03-05 21:51:00,5505,"More than a few people think Don's expiry date is over,and some don't care to watch him,but we all found the time to watch coach's corner.Does that not say the man still has some hockey knowledge?,We all really do watch him no matter what we say."
673342,Dan668,2012-03-05 22:02:00,1120,Out of line. Dont enjoy watching him. Burke has brought a few players from Ontario. A close friend of mine was drafted last year by the TML.
673349,Harrison,2012-03-05 22:11:00,2202, Yes sir.  I read an article today that mentioned Burke has whined to media brass before and not just at cbc.
673359,bushart,2012-03-05 22:42:00,2628,I thought it was the most entertaining part of that nights's game
