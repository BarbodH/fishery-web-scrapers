673286,craigdritchie,2012-03-05 19:32:00,1586,"I really should bet on hockey. I said the Loafs would probably finish the year somewhere between 25th and 30th place.  Just looked and yup, they're all alone in 25th place.  Who would have guessed?"

673716,Rod Caster,2012-03-07 01:38:00,5784,"oh jeez, he's just easy to beat. Sad, very sad.  I say keep him in until the 9th goal then pull him, send him to minors and trade him for a bus.  The leafs had a chance tonight.  "
672891,Rod Caster,2012-03-04 03:01:00,5784," After tonight it's clear the leafs are better than Montreal, but that doesn't say much  I'd say this season might be good for Montreal's future, but their draft history is terrible."
672892,Grimace,2012-03-04 03:01:00,2020,I guess it is too soon to build a bronze statue of Randy Carlyle in front of the ACC?   Lol.   Good game.
672904,grimsbylander,2012-03-04 04:38:00,3016,"It's very quiet tonight... Big surprise. Had the Leafs lost, the regulars would have been out in full force regurgitating the same old lines."
672906,jedimaster,2012-03-04 04:42:00,3472,The seniorita fans dare not post on a night where the sens lost there last one and the leafs won there's. I suspect if the sens lose to florida on saturday we won't hear anything for a few days from them.
672908,Live2fish85,2012-03-04 05:09:00,1633,"I just wanted to add to muskymatt lol. You talk about Wilson having such great credentials and Carlyle having nothing. That there shows you know crap all. Wilson has not won a cup if I do recall, where Carlyle has. I know the Sens don't think the cup means anything as they have never seen it in there arena but in the NHL that is all that matters. So out of the most important things as coach Carlyle has what Wilson doesn't. Next time you want to talk trash make sure you know your ass from a hole in the ground.   As for the leafs they started off slow and still didn't look the best but they won due to smart coachin and the fact Wilson wasn't there."

672944,lookinforwalleye,2012-03-04 14:31:00,4399,  Yawn!!!!  when does pike season open???

672994,Oggie,2012-03-04 17:18:00,588,"Thanks Don for your passion. It needed to be said. If chanting""fire Wilson"" got the coach fired what do we chant to get some canadians on the team?"
672999,bushart,2012-03-04 17:42:00,2628,The deal with players based on Birth certificates though  You know already if the certificate is Canadian---what the player has been through to get there.  Good training and competitive and an inherited wanting to win.
673026,jedimaster,2012-03-04 20:02:00,3472,If everyone showed up to the games wearing team Canada jersey's that would be an impressive statement...imagine every person in the ACC with a canada jersey waving canadian flags.

673044,davey buoy,2012-03-04 21:01:00,5505, If only Harold Ballard was around to see what they've done. LOL.
673079,Jigger,2012-03-04 22:37:00,1237,"There are only so many players in the league at a given time. Didnt burke say he wanted to select Tavares that draft? Obviously, he didnt move up that far to pick that ON boy. But... He did pick Kadri, from London ON. Stuart Percy was then taken at the 25th selection in the 2011 draft. Ya, from Oakville ON. In fact, on the Marlies roster, there are no less than 7 players from Ontario on the active roster. I like Don and find his feud with Burke mildly amusing. But plays with the facts to support his position. If those guys were ready to play in the bigs, they would be. Burkes answer to Maclean before the game was the right one."

673101,tb4me,2012-03-05 00:17:00,3295,Grapes was talking about Ontario boys not Canadians.
673118,Jigger,2012-03-05 01:13:00,1237,Posts 13-15 on the last page were what i was referring to with that. Read my previous post. It deals with coaches corner and Players from ON.
673166,backbay,2012-03-05 04:45:00,773,Probably against the rules of your condo corporation!
673229,Oggie,2012-03-05 14:55:00,588,Good point. Cherry is talking about Ontario kids not Canadians. I think you'll see Kadri up soon if Carlyle wants some sandpaper. I'm not convinced Lombardi or Frattin deserve to be here over Kadri.
673231,BillM,2012-03-05 14:56:00,17367,"Carlyle is not going to get rid of a 6ft, 200lb forward for Kadri...Frattin has been playing good.   I think Kadri should be up with the big club, but not at the sacrifice of Frattin."
672524,Chance,2012-03-03 03:49:00,420,"  Naw, not even close.His game is a bit too obvious to get to anyone.Every post the same ....just lonlely I suppose."
672528,Rod Caster,2012-03-03 03:53:00,5784,I like him better on the Jets blueline
672548,BillM,2012-03-03 04:38:00,17367,I'd rather have Ted Nolan.
672550,Live2fish85,2012-03-03 04:48:00,1633, Or Dallas Eakins but anyone is better then Ron Wilson.
672551,BillM,2012-03-03 04:57:00,17367," The change is good, let's hope he lights a fire under their asses!"
672555,Live2fish85,2012-03-03 05:54:00,1633," I think the fact that they don't need to worry about Wilson being up there asses will do a number for the team.  Wilson would throw any of them under the bus nationaly for a small mistake and change goalies as soon as they lost a game.  Anything is better then what Wilson was doing. It is just to bad that Burke and him were friends, he would have been gone long before if they weren't."
672556,BassAsin,2012-03-03 06:18:00,806,I'm s sens fan so nolan behind the bench I don't want to see. He would be the best thing to happen to the make ya laffs.    But then again Toronto is the city where leaves bloom in the fall and die in the spring.
672674,craigdritchie,2012-03-03 15:29:00,1586, Saturday March 3 - Loafs fire Ron Wilson and hire Randy Carlyle.  Did I call this or what?
672676,grimsbylander,2012-03-03 15:35:00,3016,Good call Craig! Maybe Burke is a OFC fan??
672677,bushart,2012-03-03 15:41:00,2628,"OK Craig---I'll be needin those pro line piks for tonite, thanks"
672687,Cookslav,2012-03-03 16:31:00,1457,Bout time...  I was not a fan of Wilson behind the Leaf bench at any point. He's a great coach when his bench is full of experience....but he simply belittles and crushes his kids. And LOVED to pass the buck. Good ridence IMO...  But to late for the leafs IMO as well....they have a TOUGH March schedule.
672725,BillM,2012-03-03 19:49:00,17367,I liked what I heard at the interview.  A tougher Leafs squad is something everyone would like to see.  And they've gotta use their speed...
672729,Jigger,2012-03-03 20:07:00,1237, Burke hires a former associate? Will wonders never cease! That must be a mighty big crystal ball you got there Craig!  Wasn't he the guy that denied the Sens a sip from the Cup?
672782,craigdritchie,2012-03-03 22:16:00,1586,"You know Jigger, I thought it was clear as day as soon as Carlyle got dusted by the Ducks. I'm absolutely amazed that in a thread this long, I was the first guy to throw that name out there.  Oh wait ...... I mean  I AM A HOCKEY GENIUS!!!!  Please, everyone, in any future conversations about the Loafs I ask you to kindly address me as ""Vito From Woodbridge.""  And yeah you may be right about Ottawa. But who hasn't denied them? They're the Buffalo Bills of hockey.   Bushart - if it's a critical game, always pick the Loafs to choke. Unless they're playing Ottawa in the playoffs. Then bet on the Loafs to win in four straight.   Grimsbylander - these days Burke looks like more of a KFC fan!"
672808,moxie,2012-03-03 23:39:00,1566,Ya!!! Lets Fire Wilson!!! WOW !!!! Really??? Another knee jerk reaction in the never ending list of knee jerk reactions. Silly Leaf Fans. Unlikely to happen but I hope they go 0-Fer the rest of the way just to hear what the next magic cure is. Go Habs Go!!!!!!!

672864,DRIFTER_016,2012-03-04 01:01:00,10439, That was AWESOME!!!!! I think he's ready to drop the gloves!!!    :clapping:
672867,grimsbylander,2012-03-04 01:14:00,3016,Haha That was AWESOME!! The stats about the Ontario players was a bit disturbing. Good on Don for saying it like it is!!!!!
672868,Handlebarz,2012-03-04 01:18:00,3790,There is a reason don was one of the top 10 Canadians of all times he is 100% behind every one of us here in Canada.  That was a very moving speech he gave with such passion thank you don for all you have done for Canada. Oh yeah put Burke on the side lines
672878,jedimaster,2012-03-04 02:06:00,3472,"That was so awesome. I wish I had it on PVR I would up it on youtube for eveyone to see. If you missed it he pretty much told burke to take the americans and shove it. No offense to our our american friends of course. There is not nearly enough patriotis, here in canada. I think I am probably the only condo dweller with a canadian flag hanging in my blancony. Would love to see more of it. Especially on the leafs. Not one GTHL Player on the leafs, and no ontario kids? Is that true? No wonder we haven't made the playoffs in so long."
672887,grimsbylander,2012-03-04 02:46:00,3016, HAHAHAHA 3-1. Nice spanking. MOANtreal is brutal.

672381,muskymatt,2012-03-03 01:26:00,2608,"Now that he's fired, plan the parade route laff fans, that was all that was needed. LoL A gm that screwed up every trade and a bunch of under achievers on the ice, fire one of the winningest coaches in the league....  Bahahahaha , what an org"
672384,muskymatt,2012-03-03 01:28:00,2608," McLean is doing just fine Laff fan, don't you worry. ;-)  As I remember the laffs had another meltdown against the Blackhawks, but I won't go there!!"
672388,DRIFTER_016,2012-03-03 01:36:00,10439,  How are the Sen's doing against the Hawks? Kicking their   's I guess from this post.
672389,tb4me,2012-03-03 01:36:00,3295,carlyle is the new coach accordnig to Dreggers twitter page..will be on the bench tomorrow in montreal  Mike Keenan is the only other coach Burke fired mid season..
672390,grimsbylander,2012-03-03 01:38:00,3016,What??? You don't want the winningest coach in history?? Haha don't bother trying to make sense now seniority fan. Hey gotta go...wanna catch the third period of the Chicago practice.
672393,Jigger,2012-03-03 01:42:00,1237,Carlyle sounds like a real media friendly guy.

672403,muskymatt,2012-03-03 01:53:00,2608,Ya Carlyle has way better credentials than Wilson....bahahhahahaha Good luck with that laff nation!!
672405,Oggie,2012-03-03 01:53:00,588,This is likely a dumb question but ........is he American?
672408,lhousesoccer,2012-03-03 01:58:00,442,He's from Sudbury.

672415,Ralph Field,2012-03-03 02:06:00,1018,Announced on Sports Net that Wilson has now been fired
672428,Chance,2012-03-03 02:22:00,420,Too late to make any sort of an impact though
672440,grimsbylander,2012-03-03 02:35:00,3016,This is like Christmas!! Wilson is gone and the ladies in Ottawa lost. Gonchar tweeted Kane...he wants his jock back.
672445,bushart,2012-03-03 02:41:00,2628,Burke is relying on memories here  Maybe he figures---Carlyle--won in Anaheim and was an ex-leaf---so he'd fit   Don't think so---If you can't cut it as a coach in southern california----you aint gonna make it in the centre of the universe.
672448,DRIFTER_016,2012-03-03 02:42:00,10439, Devils spanked the Caps too.
672450,Live2fish85,2012-03-03 02:45:00,1633,Muskymatt you may want to learn what you are talking about. You are just talking crap and and no clue what your talking about.  Wilson is a good coach... When he has players that are older and have payed in the league awhile.  The leafs are all young guys for the most part. Your sens still suck and they will not make it past the first round if they make it to the playoffs.  You are just worried now that because Wilson is gone you know the leafs will turn around and play well.  That goes to the rest of you that said it was the leafs players that sucked so bad and not the coach. You will see a big difference now. They will play better because they aren't worried about making a mistake or being thrown under a bus for a mistake. Wilson was the worst thing for the leafs.
672457,Chance,2012-03-03 02:51:00,420, He's just lonely and looking for attention.
672495,Grimace,2012-03-03 03:22:00,2020,"Carlyle is a big prick and makes Wilson look like your favourite uncle.  I hope this works but when Carlyle  croaks, grunts and insults the media in the post game pressers I will not be  surprised.   The one thing I will say about the smug bugger is this, his relationship with Burke is professional not personal like Wilson's.  He will demand a goalie among other things and that can't be bad."
672499,Grimace,2012-03-03 03:26:00,2020,"Oh wow, the filter has figured out b.ass t.urd.  How impressive.   Wouldn't want to infect the masses."
672514,grimsbylander,2012-03-03 03:43:00,3016," Ah don't let Muskymatt get to you. He doesn't love hockey, he dislikes the Leafs. Toronto could have Christ himself out there in a blue and white robe and then he'd be saying he can only walk on water cause it's frozen. Come on Saturday night hockey!!"
671877,jimmer,2012-03-01 19:07:00,2730,"I don't know about that. He had the option to sign anywhere he wanted a couple years back when he was a free agent. What did he do? I would love to see him in a Leafs uniform, but not if they have to trade every prospect they have to get him in the summer."
671881,Chance,2012-03-01 19:15:00,420,"  When he signed promises were made and not accomplished.Not all what he thought it would be.He now wants out,even said so in a TV interview.Take it for what its worth,believe me or not but I can say with 100% certainty he would welcome a trade to Toronto."
671925,lookinforwalleye,2012-03-01 21:27:00,4399, LOL darn those bluejackets only thing standing in the way of a nice lottery pick!!!  A this point in the habs evolution a win over the leafs is some strange form of comfort!!!
671927,Oggie,2012-03-01 21:37:00,588,Every coach reaches the point where the playeers aren't listening anymore. He is still a good coach but he's used all the one liners; all the rabbits are out of the hat and the players aren't willing to play for him anymore. Time to move on. They are a young team  and i doubt he relates well to the kids on the team.
671939,moxie,2012-03-01 22:30:00,1566,"      I will agree Rick Nash would be a great addition to any team. As far as the Salary Cap goes MLSE has thrown good money after bad for years and it has been an utter embarrassment .  IMO the primary reason so many teams are thriving and are still in the hunt for a playoff spot this late in the season is that the three point game has watered down much of the competition in order to keep the American fans interested and hopeful. This might be due to the fact that Gargoyle Bettman still believes that he can fool Americans that only see snow and ice on television into choosing hockey over the NFL, NBA and MLB, not to mention the equivalent sports at the College level. Just my three cents.   Ps. Dale Talon Built the Hawks into a Championship Team and if Panthers ownership is patient and willing to pony up he is well on his way to building another Contender in Florida. Both those teams recently beat the Leafs on back to back nights."
672109,craigdritchie,2012-03-02 05:44:00,1586,"It's March 1, coming up on midnight, and I'm in Winnipeg for the Mid-Canada Boat Show. My hotel is pretty close to the MTS Centre, and Jets fans are still going nuts out in the street after they smoked Florida and nailed down - for the moment at least - a playoff spot.  It's exciting to be here tonight. This is what hockey is all about. You'd think the Jets just won the cup the way these people are partying.  And the Loafs back home in Toronto? Tonight they're 5 points out of a playoff spot, and sitting 22nd place in a 30-team league (some may recall that back in September I predicted they would finish the year between 25th and 30th place. I'm still confident that's where they'll finish).  Something has to be done back home. Wilson is dead man walking. So what are the odds of Burke offering the job to his old pal Randy Carlyle? I'll make another fearless prediction and say there will be a discussion, and probably sooner rather than later."
672178,BillM,2012-03-02 14:42:00,17367,We gotta start a 'Bring back Teddy Nolan' campaign!  LOL
672183,Harrison,2012-03-02 14:52:00,2202,Burke is just waiting for the US dollar to get a bit stronger to let his bud Ronnie go.  Promote Dallas Eakins!  Lets not let another awesome coach in the leaf system get away like Crawford or Quenneville.
672186,Lip-ripper,2012-03-02 14:59:00,228,
672199,jedimaster,2012-03-02 16:16:00,3472," I would consider trading in my blue and white if crawford ever stepped behind the bench. He is worse than an American, a true Canadian Traitor. A disgrace to Canadian hockey.  As for Wilson, I really don't think Burke will do anything until the end of the season, but if they lose to Montreal it is clear that on any other team he would be out the door. Seriously with the schedule the leafs have coming up a coaching change doesn't feel like it will make a hill of beans.  Mtl, Boston, Pits, Phil, Wash, Florida, Tampa, Ottawa, Boston, Isl, Jersey, Rangers, Canes, Phili, Buff, Buff, Tamp, Montreal  I would say the only saving grace is the last 4 games of the season. If they can hang in with a couple points of 8th place its possible. Just highly unlikely. They can lose 5 games, and likely make a good run for a play off spot.  So they need to win all the games they should win...Thats Montreal x2, Tampa x2, Canes, Isles That leaves 12 games  They absolutely need to win the 4 games against the other contenders with Buff x2, Flor, Wash Down to 8 games.  Then take your pick of dropping five of these... I like the leafs against Pits and Ottawa, Boston is pretty much a write off, Phili will be tough as will jersey as the leafs don't play well against trappers. Boston x2 Pits Philx2 Ottawa New Jersey Rangers   It's starting to look grim but if we continue to drop games against the bottom feeders, its time to clear off some tee times."
672203,Headhunter,2012-03-02 16:46:00,5703,"This team came out of the gate on fire... many teams around the legue remarked at how quick they were and how difficult it was to play against them. Flash forward a few months and they can't even make one pass to get out of their own end... I find myself scratching my head trying to figure out how one of the fasted teams in the league, has become a group of butt draggers? Can I blame the coach? The coach aint on the ice skating!  Unfortuantely, my early season prediction is coming true... blue and white disease had hit full on... I think I'm beginning to become a Jets fan! HH"
672204,muskymatt,2012-03-02 16:47:00,2608,"I thought a laff fan was a laff fan for life? Now you say you would trade in the blue and white!!! What if Crawford was a good fit? At this point the laffs should consider any possibility, what they have obviously isn't working.  The only thing I can see that would improve the team is a new GM and maybe coach, all the wind and Bull Burke slung around when he first came to the laffs is a joke now. He hasn't achieved a single thing, period!  Ridiculous!!"
672213,Jigger,2012-03-02 17:34:00,1237," Gotta say, im all aboard the Eakins bus. He employs the same game plan as Wilson, but can deal with the youth better than Ron can. I think that if another coach comes in, he'll bolt at the first offer. Especially when you consider any incoming coach will have some term on his contract. Eakins may feel, at that point, like he may never get a shot with the blue and white."
672214,bushart,2012-03-02 17:35:00,2628,Will we ever---ever---ever---forgive Crawford for not puttin Gretzky in that shootout  NOT!!!!!

672226,muskymatt,2012-03-02 18:12:00,2608,"Comment justified, I stand corrected"
672230,Oggie,2012-03-02 18:21:00,588,Its too late to change coaches now. Ride it out and take the time to get a coach that fits the plan as soon as Burke tells us what the REAL plan is? I can't get over the lack of truculance. I think the opposition could run the goalie from centre ice and nobody except Brown would respond. Where's the sandpaper Burke eluded to? And why did Wilson give them the day off? I think the coach just tossed the towel.
672231,Headhunter,2012-03-02 18:23:00,5703,I was a Leaf fan when the Dead Sea was still just slightly ill! HH
672233,jedimaster,2012-03-02 18:30:00,3472," I figured someone would get the meaning of that statement. I could never forgive Crawford for that. The look on The Great One's face is still etched into my brain like it was yesterday. If I remember correctly  Fleury, borque, newenndyke, Lindros, Shanahan.  I remember almost falling on the ground when I heard this list. HOW is it possible? What happened? Then they panned over the bench and you could catch glimpse of gretz. Wow I couldn't believe it. On the bench? Riding the pine?  No offense to Borque, one the the great players to play the game. But NOT the greatest. Joe had a great olympics so yah, Lindros, yah, Fleury, umm I dunno, I guess so. Shanny? I love Shanny, but I dunno about that one either."

672378,grimsbylander,2012-03-03 01:25:00,3016,Hope he goes to Ottawa! They haven't touched the puck in the second period against Chicago.
671749,bushart,2012-03-01 12:37:00,2628,Up Front---I'm not dumpin on em  The Leafs are a marketing machine---always that glimmer of hope given with endless possibilities  Unfortunately reality has not lived up with those glimmers  Like TSN putting the Leafs in the Rick Nash mix--etc-----But it is getting so militant with the fan base---bleed blue or die  It's getting like Monty Python-----Oh yeah---just a flesh wound  Maybe they should be more critical of their team as opposed to continous support mode--which in fairness is historically based as for a long time Canada had only 2 out of 6 teams to chose from  Like The Cats and Argos  So it was tradition----So Leaf Fans you may wish to ask yourself and the team----how long do you want to keep the status quo---can't blame Ferguson anymore and getting harder to take solice in a couple fruitless defeats of an Ottawa Team getting to be many years ago.  PS---I even picked a pro line last nite with the Leafs to beat Chicago soooo?
671758,SmokestackLightnin,2012-03-01 13:00:00,390,Well after discussions in my beer league dressing room last night and reading this morning that Burke's loyalty to Wilson is getting in the way I am starting to think that they both have to go.
671764,Chance,2012-03-01 13:27:00,420,  Are you saying the Leafs were not in the mix for Nash?
671768,cynmar,2012-03-01 13:38:00,169,"The Leafs and the Raptors are marketing marvels. These teams draw in big dollars, (don't know the comparison to same market size teams in the States) and as far as a business is concerned are successes. These companies aren't in this to win a Stanley Cup, they aren't in it to win games or make it to the playoffs. They're in it to show return to the shareholders and that's the problem. I'll probably be called an idiot but I look at some of the football teams like the Pittsburgh Steelers who are owned by the same family for a significant period of time, they seem to still have a passion for winning versus corporate owned teams. If the fans started staying away and let it be known we expect a return for the money we spend, maybe the Leafs and Raptors would make the next step to be more successful. As long as the corporation is making money with the status quo, that's where it'll stay.  Bill"

671775,Chance,2012-03-01 13:54:00,420,Nash does want to play for the leafs.Dont get me wrong they need far more than Nash but as far as him wanting to come here it is a certainty.

671784,Harrison,2012-03-01 14:27:00,2202, You sure? Why would any franchise player? Why come here get your game picked apart and get blamed when the media has nothing else to do with a crappy playing franchise.  There is no one to blame but the coaching and brass when they suck at gelling the talent.  I don't think a shortage of talent is a problem to atleast make the playoffs.  Highest grossing team in the league with the largest fan base.  There is no excuse not to make the playoffs atleast. Fill the team with GTA players and coaches/brass. That would flip things around IMO.
671785,bushart,2012-03-01 14:30:00,2628,You might not wish to take a census of Local Metro players in the league right now---it would be depressing

671801,Chance,2012-03-01 15:09:00,420,"  Positive beyond a shadow of a doubt.I am not saying the Leafs are his only team or even his first team of choice but he does want to play in Toronto that I do know. Highest grossing team has nothing to do with making the playoffs.With the cap in place all teams operate under the same restraints.With that said many teams are operating under those conditions andf thriving,Toronto is not."
671804,Chance,2012-03-01 15:18:00,420,  I would love to see that census or anything eluding to that fact please.

671809,Chance,2012-03-01 15:32:00,420,  Ahhh I do see your point.Ontario in general has always been the meca for hockey talent.The GTHL produces some great players and will for years to come.Unfortunately only a very small number make the big league.
671813,DRIFTER_016,2012-03-01 15:45:00,10439,  So that's why my 7th row tickets on the blue line for the Jets/Lightning game on March 30th were ony $100 each including taxes and ticketmaster fees while the same ticket in TO would be $225. GO JETS!!!!!!
671820,Chance,2012-03-01 16:00:00,420,"  Usually cheaper to fly to Florida,get a hotel room and watch a Leafs Panthers game than it is to see them in Toronto."
671822,Harrison,2012-03-01 16:02:00,2202," Never believe the media, agents or even players during contract talks or trade deadlines. lol  It's called bargining in the media.  Sure a player will say he'd love to play at home, it's a bargining chip.  There is a cap sure, but not on everything."
671823,Chance,2012-03-01 16:03:00,420,  I agree but my certainty has nothing to do with the media.

Three unanswered goals? I'm guessing Chicago is gearing up for the playoffs and just wanted to practice coming from behind? It's possible isn't it? Is anyone having as much fun as I am??? Next in line is the Habs who have basically given up the ghost this year and are just plain awful but given the Century old  Rivalry these two team share doesn't mean it will be easy by any stretch.

671569,kickingfrog,2012-02-29 22:46:00,8333,Wilson was given a one year extension. For a team with the revenue of the Leafs that is in essence a golden parachute.
671570,Grimace,2012-02-29 22:47:00,2020,They also usually fire a coach when a weak part of the schedule approaches.  That way they look brilliant when the team beats up on a few cellar dwellers.
671576,Rod Caster,2012-02-29 23:00:00,5784,"Here is a positive (not for leafs) article from J.R. on NHL.com. Take J.R.'s writing with a grain of salt, but either way, it's a good read for a Coyotes fan   He's blaming Toronto's cold streak on the players, not the coach.  What's Clicking?  The Phoenix Coyotes = red hot.  They've had the most controversy of any team in the NHL during the last two or three years with the ownership issue, but GM Don Maloney has done just a tremendous job of not only keeping the faith within that dressing room, but bringing in quality players and a coach who has created a great playing atmosphere for these players.  You can tell by the way they play.  They were up against adversity going into the All-Star break, and they come out playing like their playoff lives were on the line. Now to be unbeaten in February and third in a difficult, strong Western Conference without any major superstars just tells you how much pride is in that locker room.  Shane Doan, who is one of the best men I've ever met in the game, is a true professional in the way that he runs this team, captains this team, leads it by example.  Radim Vrbata is drastically under-appreciated in the NHL for what he can do and for the season he's having. For him to not make the All-Star Game was such a kick in the face.  And, I've got to give props to Ray Whitney -- 20 years in the NHL and he's leading the Coyotes in points. He continues to be a great locker room leader and a fantastic person to watch on the ice. To keep his level of play as high as he has is a true testament to him as a competitor.  All in all, I am very proud of the Coyotes and I hope for continued success for them. I really hope they can continue this right on into the playoffs and be that team that nobody wants to play come April 10.  Kudos to them. Job well done.  What's Missing?  The Toronto Maple Leafs = ice cold.  This is a team that is under probably the most scrutiny of any in the NHL, especially because they haven't made the playoffs since 2004, but you have to wonder what it is now. It's not coaching because obviously Ron Wilson has a system in place that had the team flying high in the beginning of the season.  You know what, I'm going to make the same statement I made last week about the New York Islanders: Does this team even want to make the playoffs? Does this team even want to make the sacrifice that it takes to win crucial games night in and night out?  I know Florida is a good team, but you can't lose to the Florida Panthers at home when you're battling for the eighth and final playoff spot in the Eastern Conference. There are too many teams right now that are refusing to take that next step, and Toronto is in that group.  Phil Kessel has continued to play strong hockey. Joffrey Lupul has fallen off a bit. But, the guy who has fallen off the most and is hurting this team is Mikhail Grabovski.  It bothers me so much when a guy with that much talent has so many ups and downs throughout a season. You can't be as good as Grabovski was and then be as poor as Grabovski has been. Either you're good or you're not.  To me, it's simply about effort.  Grabovski is a great player and he needs to step up and be accountable for the way he's performing.  But, unfortunately, goalies James Reimer and Jonas Gustavsson have also fallen on quiet times. That's not helping the cause at all for Wilson and Brian Burke or the Toronto Maple Leafs' fans.  Finally, I have heard they're calling for Wilson to be fired, chanting for it at Air Canada Centre; but it's not right. Why is it Wilson's fault now? What about the beginning of the season? They weren't calling for his head then.  It now goes down to the players because they're not performing to their expectations. They have proven that they can do it, that the system works, but now they have to play the system and stop blaming the coach.  They just need to do what it takes to win hockey games."
671581,glen,2012-02-29 23:09:00,2641,They dont want to play for wilson.  It is going to be funny as hell to watch the fans throw stuff at wilson.  I hope they keep it coming.  For the first time i feel like going to the game just to chant fire wilson.
671594,moxie,2012-02-29 23:37:00,1566,"The whole organization has pretty much sucked for 40+ yrs. Four decades of Doom.

The head on this snake has stunk up and infected an entire city for a very long time and it is sure to continue with the next addition of ownership to be shared by two media adversaries that have never avoided pissing on each other at every opportunity.

671717,uglyfish,2012-03-01 04:08:00,981,"The leafs won't be winners with phaneuf, liles, grabovski and macarthur on the team. Grabo is selfish half the time and gives the puck away too much, and sucks defensively. Macarthur gives the puck away. Liles is horrible in his own end, too many giveaways. Phaneuf can't do anything but screw up. Giveaways, poor defensive zone play, and just half assed attempts at taking a player out.  Everyone wants wilson fired, and says he doesn't know how to coach. Because he's the one on the ice screwing up everytime he touches the puck, rite? When they were tops in the league, everyone was praising him for taking such a young team and making them winners. But he clearly had no idea how to coach... Only one of the winningest coahes in the game, and only one to have been coaching in the NHL each of the past 16 or so seasons.  And to the ones complaing that burke has a hardon for americans and that's all he wants.... Burke PREFERS canadian players on his teams. Incase u don't remember, when he won the cup in anaheim, they had the largest number of canadian players on their roster in the league.  Reimer has played fine, every goalie let's in bad goals. This KID has won more games for them then he has lost. He doesn't get rattled and plays solid. Look at the games they lose. He gets no help in front of him, half the goals are on epic turn overs and just horrible defensive play, and they don't get much offsense for him either.  Burke didn't make trades cause he wasn't giving up a stupid amount for a player. Draft picks are good, when there's a good draft class. This year is a bit weak. GM's push the price up at the deadline. U can get the same player for half as much in the summer.  Wait till the summer, win or lose, changes will come. Players will be sent out, others brought in. This team is headed in the rite direction. Few small pieces away from serious contention.  The sens just surprised ppl this year, they are over achieving and will fall back to reality soon enough. No need to worry about that. Leafs did the same thing this season."
671720,BillM,2012-03-01 04:33:00,17367,Even with the loss tonight they looked a lot better.  Emery did a great job after coming in at the start of the 2nd period.

These guys aren't as useless as you make it out to be. Lets be honest they made it into the NHL which isn't so easy as they are a dime a dozen.  I played hockey my whole life and even with useless players a good coach can make a team play well. My dad did it.  As for Wilson just changing them when they make a mistake. That isn't helping at all.  The goalies and Wilson are there biggest problem."

671475,[email protected],2012-02-29 19:46:00,119,"it's really a disgrace that Nolan has seemingly been blackballed from the NHL.  Great guy, who had players who were willing to lay it all on the line for him.  He demanded his players actually play hard.  Never heard a former player say anything negative about the man, except for how hard he worked them, which is a good thing.  Bring him back, anywhere !!!!!"
671481,moxie,2012-02-29 19:59:00,1566,"Everyone has the magic answer and heres mine. The entire franchise needs to be retired. Most Leafs fans are just that, Leaf fans. There are 29 other teams in the Bigs and in any of those arenas the fans don't show unless there is something to show for. I was a Leaf fan years back but grew up and became a hockey fan instead. On nights they play I make a crapload of Popcorn, get comfy in my favorite evening wear and watch only to cheer on the opposing teams, and on most nights for the past 20 years I wait for the collective agonizing moans and groans from their loyal but mostly misguided faithful. The circus ain't coming to town anytime soon and you know why? It never left.....hehehehehe.    GO LAUGHS GO!!!!!!!!!!!!"
671484,BillM,2012-02-29 20:04:00,17367,Retire the most profitable team in the league.  Put down the crack pipe!
671486,Harrison,2012-02-29 20:12:00,2202,"Nolan is a great call.  Would love to see Hitchcock on the bench.  Have a buddy who played for him, swears he is the best coach he ever played for."
671488,BillM,2012-02-29 20:13:00,17367, Crack sandwiches help with the heartbreak the Leafs have provided me the past 3 weeks
671491,bushart,2012-02-29 20:17:00,2628,Not a Leaf guy---But Nolan is a good coach not coaching in the league he should be
671492,Grimace,2012-02-29 20:18:00,2020," Don't put it down, pass it over.  I can't take being a Leaf's fan anymore.  :-)"
671493,moxie,2012-02-29 20:18:00,1566,"Crack Pipe? Sandwich? ROFLMAO!!!!!!! Must be the misguided lashing out. Anyone who continues to  follow this mess will be in dire straights soon because once the OXY's are banned in Ontario there won't be anything remotely strong enough to take away the pain. Even if they make the playoffs, what then? Crack Pipe?........LOL!!!!!!!!    Edited because I dropped my Crack Pipe on the keyboard......lolololololol!!!!!Whew!!!!"
671495,Lunker777,2012-02-29 20:23:00,866,LETS GO WINGS !
671498,BillM,2012-02-29 20:26:00,17367, What's great about the NHL is that you can cheer for any team you want.. It's only us diehards that continue to endure the punishment the Leafs dish out
671500,bushart,2012-02-29 20:30:00,2628,You know all's you need is a leaf jersey---some whips---masks and leather accessories--a video camera  and bingo----you got Leaf Porno-----maybe title it---Master Blue and the innocent fanbase
671501,muskymatt,2012-02-29 20:30:00,2608,Diehards is one word you could use...lol
671502,Chance,2012-02-29 20:31:00,420,  Never mess with a Leafs fan we can take an amazing amount of dissapointment and punishment
671510,blaque,2012-02-29 20:49:00,2419, Tell that to Dominik Hasek!!    That juicy rumor has been said to be the reason he was fired from Buffalo and blackballed ever since
671515,kickingfrog,2012-02-29 21:00:00,8333,It was upper management that blackballed Ted.
671516,kickingfrog,2012-02-29 21:04:00,8333,Don't forget Hasek attacked the Buffalo writer Jim Kelly and he's a goalie. By definition they're nutjobs.
671518,Grimace,2012-02-29 21:07:00,2020,The late Jim Kelly.  I miss Jim.  I really liked him on the McCown show.
671521,blaque,2012-02-29 21:07:00,2419, Ya there was much to the story. Including him going to the owners to have Muckler dismissed as they didnt see eye to eye on much. Muckler having bigger influence within the league.......was said to have put him on the blacklist. Who knows?
671528,Oggie,2012-02-29 21:26:00,588,He'd throttle half the team for their lack of work ethic. What ever coach we get lets get a bloody Canadian! I'm sick of watching team USA.
671534,muskymatt,2012-02-29 21:38:00,2608," The real question is what coach would want to go to Toronto and work under an egomaniac like Burke? Why do you think this guy keeps hiring his buddies, maybe because he's an   and no one else would work for the guy?  Whatever the case may be, it's year 4 of the rebuild, 3 missed years under Burke already. It's not Wilson who picks the team.  "
671535,kickingfrog,2012-02-29 21:40:00,8333,Wilson was not hired by Burke. Another fact you have wrong.    He will be fired by him however.
671536,BillM,2012-02-29 21:40:00,17367,I don't think talent is the issue.
671539,Grimace,2012-02-29 21:51:00,2020,"A quote from Dave Hodge that made me laugh.  ""Ron Wilson is thinking of using 'Robo Calls' to send Leafs fans to the wrong rink"".   You gotta love Dave Hodge!"
671547,jedimaster,2012-02-29 22:02:00,3472,"Although Wilson was not hired by Burke, Wilson was hired while the whole Burke situation was being dealt with internally, so the Wilson hiring was although not done by burke, he no doubt had input. Not to mention he extended him. I too think Wilson should go. Allong with this get the ""Americans  on the team first"" attitude."
671197,grimsbylander,2012-02-29 12:28:00,3016,The playoff stretch and the games are actually getting worse. Player's fault? Coach's fault? Doesn't matter who's fault? They're imploding at the worse possible time. Burke is loyal but to what extent?
671207,muskymatt,2012-02-29 12:56:00,2608,"Yes they are, beautiful isn't it??  Complete collapse, monumental falter!  23 guys suck, but fire the coach!  GM is a joke but fire the coach!  Fire one of the winningest coaches in the league.  Yes TML, the coach, gm and player graveyard of the NHL.  Silly laffs, when will they ever learn!!  Bahaahahahahaahahahahha  LEAFS SUCK!!"
671213,grimsbylander,2012-02-29 13:02:00,3016,  Hahaha Awesome! How did I know you'd be the first to reply?? What took ya so long???
671217,Gregoire,2012-02-29 13:09:00,1397,I'm surprised no one has blamed the teachers yet...wait a mimute they don't own the team anymore.
671219,spinnerbaitking,2012-02-29 13:14:00,1622,"I can't imagine anyone expecting any more after all we are talking about the Leafs in the latter part of the year, golfing they will go lol  Tight Lines SBK"
671220,bushart,2012-02-29 13:15:00,2628,Ya know---admittedly I'm superstitous---ask Mat  Maybe it's an Irish thing??  Anyway---it would be hard to find the thread now----but I recall mentioning to a certain Leaf fan who started the parade thread back in November when they sat near the top of the standings  That it was indeed........NOVEMBER  OK Leaf Nation-----get him!!
671231,Grimace,2012-02-29 13:47:00,2020,Only 4 points out of a lottery pick!   He Stays!
671234,danbouck,2012-02-29 13:52:00,4380,I blame society
671245,Brettiop,2012-02-29 14:11:00,279,"Well there is no doubt he should be fired, no coach deserves this much time behind the bench of a squad that shows no consistency...(i guess there loosing consistently nowadays)  I doubt it happens, burke probably lets Wilson finish out his contract"
671253,smally21,2012-02-29 14:25:00,993,"you know the saying,  you win some, you lose ALOT MORE!"
671254,Lip-ripper,2012-02-29 14:26:00,228,"If they get rid of Wilson, any suggestions on a capable replacement? Not much out there right now..."
671286,SmokestackLightnin,2012-02-29 15:20:00,390, Ted Nolan
671291,jedimaster,2012-02-29 15:33:00,3472,"how about Kelly Hrudey or Nick Kypreos, they seem to know everything about how to coach a winning team. I'm not too sure who is out there but, I would think Dallas Eakins would be the go to guy as an interim anyway. He is well received by all of his players and has done pretty good with the marlies."
671301,JorgeCarlos,2012-02-29 15:52:00,109,Ted Nolan x2
671350,grimsbylander,2012-02-29 16:55:00,3016,Dallas Eakins Craig McTavish Guy Carbonneau Bruce Boudreau Marc Crawford Jacques Martin Randy Carlyle ?
671385,muskymatt,2012-02-29 17:35:00,2608,"If ALFIE (PRAISE ALFIE) retires this year, maybe the laffs could hire him as coach!!  Bahahahahaha"
671423,DRIFTER_016,2012-02-29 18:11:00,10439,GRAPES!!!!!
671453,Woodsman,2012-02-29 19:02:00,1286,To fire Wilson will first require firing Burke. Two good moves IMO.
671455,BillM,2012-02-29 19:06:00,17367, Would love to see Nolan behind the Toronto bench!
671458,kickingfrog,2012-02-29 19:09:00,8333,Any nhl bench.
671459,davey buoy,2012-02-29 19:10:00,5505,Ted Nolan x 3
671460,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2012-02-29 19:12:00,0," Teddy Nolan is such a good man, and a good coach.  Just ask Chris Simon what Teddy can do for a person on and off the ice.  It would be WAY harder to bash the leafs if a local hero like Ted took over the reigns."
671464,blaque,2012-02-29 19:15:00,2419,We miss Mr. Nolan behind the bench down here in B-Lo
671466,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2012-02-29 19:19:00,0,"there aren't many coaches that have won the Jack Adams Award, a Memorial Cup, two OHL titles, and a QMJHL championship yet are coaching the Latvian Men's Team..."
671471,BillM,2012-02-29 19:33:00,17367," Yup, I've met Nolan a few times (He loved to eat at my ex gf's restaurant in Port Dalhousie when he coached Buffalo)  Probably one of the nicest people I've ever met.  Like it was mentioned before, I'd like to see him behind ANY NHL bench, but Toronto would be tops!"
