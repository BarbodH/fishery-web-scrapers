673487,Skipper D,2012-03-06 13:07:00,1970,"If it were 4:30 in the morning right now , warm out , and i had a can of worms , i'd grab the boat and go fishing for the rest of the day . What about you ?"
673488,Roy,2012-03-06 13:13:00,13728,"Well at 4:30 this morning it was -16, I have no live bait at the house and I still have a 16 hour work day to do. I'll consider it when it's warm out, I have bait and it's a day off."
673489,Skipper D,2012-03-06 13:23:00,1970,"I am the lucky one then my friend , to be able to sit here and ponder my thoughts for a bit , at least for now , wish it was that way for every one this morning ."
673493,danbouck,2012-03-06 13:33:00,4380,It it was 4:30 I would be waking up to go for a jog. If it was warm out it would be more fun. If I had a can of worms I would sell them and buy a coffee. Then I would go to work for 10-12 hours then come home and work for 4 hours.
673494,mercman,2012-03-06 13:44:00,7054,"Jeez, by the sound of it, you guys never fish!! First, i never get up at 4.30 in the blessed AM !!!If i want a can of worms.......Well, lets not go there. But i did respool my rods, and am going to sort my tackle tonite  "
673498,grt1,2012-03-06 14:18:00,638,"so who says the fish are even UP at that ungodly hour?  now if it were a reasonable hour, i'd be in the boat with you."
673499,ccmtcanada,2012-03-06 14:22:00,7971,"If I woke up at 430, I'd go back to sleep....  Enough will go wrong throughout the day without me intentionally opening a ""can of worms""!!!"
673503,John,2012-03-06 14:41:00,2956, You're a sick man Dan....just sayin'
673504,BillM,2012-03-06 14:44:00,17367,4:30 and it was trout season?  In the truck heading to somewhere special I assume.
673509,Skipper D,2012-03-06 14:56:00,1970,"For now this morning i just finished working the last five days straight running on six hours of sleep , two guys were unable to show up so their nine hours runs became and were added to mine each day , but while i have the chance here this morning for a bit to relax i though how much better this morning would be if it could be like how i started this thread ""What if "" . Gtr .... trust me they are out there at that ungodly hour and i can always come back to the dock later to pick you up ...lol . As many days as i can i try to be on the water that time of the morning if i can before i go to work each day , with most days in the summer not getting home til dark from work leave's no time for me to go fishing the evenings ."
673510,lew,2012-03-06 14:56:00,12766,I get up every morning between 2 & 3 just because I like that time of day.  No fishing for me this morning though cause at 4:30 AM I was painting the kitchen and tomorrow morning at 4:30 AM I'll prolly be painting some more.  LUV the early morning hours
673511,Roy,2012-03-06 15:01:00,13728,"Yes, it's my quiet time. At this time of the year I'm usually catching up on reading or working on baits. The noisier stuff can start around 5 when J gets up."
673512,Old Man,2012-03-06 15:03:00,822,"Usually still asleep at 4:30am, but at 6:00am I'm up. My bait bucket almost always has a least a few minnows in it. The water is still a little hard around here for boating, but will probably hit the shack around 2:00pm to catch the late afternoon early evening bite. Probably fry up some burgers for supper down there tonight."
673514,fishindevil,2012-03-06 15:08:00,6254,"yup would be on the way to go walleye fishing for sure,  but if its monday to friday at 4:30am i have been awake for 2 hours and i am driving to work at that time .....it sucks   but it pays for the millions of hours of fishing and for all the toys and tackle i have !!!"
673517,solopaddler,2012-03-06 15:11:00,8605,"  That's inspiring Dan, good for you."
673520,whiskywizard,2012-03-06 15:15:00,305,  What a pleasant thought! Thanks for the brief daydream there.
673524,DRIFTER_016,2012-03-06 15:37:00,10439,I would turn over and go back to sleep because it was -40 at 4:30 this morning!!!
673526,Acountdeleted,2012-03-06 16:01:00,2562,"At this time of year if I woke up that early and I had today off I'd do all the final preperations for the nerf outing that my buddy and I are hosting this weekend at Heart Lake Secondary school. (thats right, I said nerf outing).  Assuming I was done that work at a decent time I think I'd try and finally tackle Bellwood lake for walleye..... or go back to bass pro and mull over the Frabil Excursion that is on sale for $375."
673610,misfish,2012-03-06 20:48:00,29133, Woose.   What Bill said.
673692,fish_fishburn,2012-03-07 00:30:00,1311,"Keep the dream alive, go back to sleep."
673819,danbouck,2012-03-07 12:29:00,4380,"It was warm out at 4:30, did you have any worms?"
673825,Big Cliff,2012-03-07 13:09:00,6899,"4:30 in the morning; I'm usually up and enjoying my first cup of coffee of the day while I sit here and catch up on the news, check on the weather reports and wait for the sun to rise. Now, if I had a buddy that was up, had a can of worms, and wanted to go fishing, I'd skip the coffee, the news, and the weather report."
673845,Skipper D,2012-03-07 13:56:00,1970,"  Well Dan i think it was around that time this morning i posted in the status box ""good morning early birds"" which was the time i was coming in to go to bed this morning , worked in the shop most of the night as its that time now for me to whip our equipment in to shape for the up coming construction season  , kinda like get it done now so when the ice gets out my mornings will be free to hit the water . Your right it was warm out this morning at that time plus a full moon and for the ""worms""....... there is a can on ice in the shop fridge ..... lol ."
673846,Skipper D,2012-03-07 13:59:00,1970,"  I wounder Cliff if Radar knows how it works for us guys  ........ lol , it wont be to much longer now ."
