673886,4x4bassin,2012-03-07 17:01:00,1025,"I have been a member of the OFAH for 20 years and I have bought my book of tickets from almost day one and I have never won a thing ! Kinda makes me wonder if my tickets are even in the draw when I send them back You have to figure after 20 years I would win at the very least a pen or something ! Maybe this will be my year , or maybe not !!!!!"
673892,bigugli,2012-03-07 17:20:00,6138,"10 tickets out of some 100,000 is pretty slim odds, even after 20 years. I'm still buying Then again I've been buying lottery tickets since the very first with the $10 Olympic Lottery and the $5 books of Wintario tickets."
673894,watertight,2012-03-07 17:28:00,50,I buy my them as well. Best way is to think of it is as a donation to a worthy cause and if you win anything it's a bonus.
673899,chessy,2012-03-07 17:45:00,610," It cost them more to run the lottery than they bring in, but it sure is a great chance at a nice prizes"
673902,4x4bassin,2012-03-07 17:58:00,1025," This is why I still buy them , if it was something else I would of gave up long ago !"
673907,walleyejigger,2012-03-07 18:15:00,876,"usually buy a ticket every year, never won. don't really expect to either,"
673927,jedimaster,2012-03-07 19:11:00,3472,I buy them as well and have never won.
674017,John Bacon,2012-03-07 23:20:00,3277, Do you have any data to back that up? They claim to paid for their new building near Peterborough with lottery proceeds.  I used to buy a lot of tickets. I usually buy one each year now when I am the Sportsman Show. I have never won anything but I keep hoping.
