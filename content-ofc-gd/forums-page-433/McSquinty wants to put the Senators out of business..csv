673672,tb4me,2012-03-06 23:58:00,3295,I see both the good and bad in this..The good would mean less corporate seats and lower ticket prices for us fans.. The bad would be yes the Send and smaller market teams may suffer.
673674,kickingfrog,2012-03-07 00:01:00,8333,"Partisanship aside, why do I have to pay full price for my ticket and the suit next to me gets to write it off on my back?"
673676,Tybo,2012-03-07 00:03:00,1373,I got a idea.Why not give the people a 50% tax break.Then they could afford to go see them play.
673694,Joeytier,2012-03-07 00:36:00,3990,"Not sure why you feel a move like this is screwing over the everyman...  Corporate subsidies like this are what drives the prices up to begin with.  Personally, I'm more than happy to see less of my tax dollars going into corporate leisure expense accounts."
673695,Joeytier,2012-03-07 00:37:00,3990, That's not vague and unsubstantiated at all...
673877,Beans,2012-03-07 16:28:00,3339,"McStingy doesn't need their money...What with all the interest he will receive when he witholds our provincial tax refunds and doles them out monthly so much at a time...  Finally, an MPP worth assassinating...   http://www.thestar.com/business/article/1140158--income-tax-changes-eliminate-refunds-for-many-ontario-residents "
673890,bigugli,2012-03-07 17:15:00,6138,Why should we subsidize corporate entertainment? Cut the tax credit.
673903,zamboniwaterboy,2012-03-07 18:01:00,126,LIKE!   CEO's get way too much!
673904,Rod Caster,2012-03-07 18:03:00,5784,The Sens will go out of business just fine on their own
