But for what ails me from time to time  , get a bottle of Brandy and take good amounts of it warmed up , as long as its burning down in there its killing germs , keep it burning til ya feel better . I think every family home should have a bottle of this in it instead of a lot of the over counter drugs .Sorry if i am off topic from not clicking on the link posted here ."
