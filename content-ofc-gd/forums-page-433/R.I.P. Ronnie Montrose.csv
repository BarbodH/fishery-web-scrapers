673693,Fisherman,2012-03-07 00:33:00,7201,I think I'd rather listen or greaseless bearings   in their final moments before they disintegrate or maybe fingernails on a chalkboard.
673698,Joey,2012-03-07 00:39:00,9122,Guess it doesn't bring back the memories to you that it does to me

And something from the earlier days with Van Morrison.  <iframe width=""560"" height=""315"" src=""http://www.youtube.com/embed/Eq3YLhtuzTQ"" frameborder=""0"" allowfullscreen></iframe>"

673918,Musky or Specks,2012-03-07 18:42:00,2710,Rock Candy is a staple on my Ipod and my 19 yr old son put it on his after hearing it. Sammy Hager never did anything as good as what he did with Montrose.
674034,Joeytier,2012-03-08 00:11:00,3990,Yep!  Montrose is great stuff.
674067,kingofthesteelhead,2012-03-08 01:48:00,140,"love that stuff had the the first two albums,MONTROSE and PAPER MONEY when I was in high school.Too many of our rock legends succumbing to this awful disease.Ronnie James Dio and now his guitar player Tony Iommi now has it.For those of you who don't know from Black Sabbath and in later years Heaven and Hell."
674200,Twocoda,2012-03-08 14:44:00,4130,Ive been a fan from the moment i heard them when i was 16....its because of Montrose i followed Sammys career my entire life....Rock Candy was the beginning of my addiction
