673634,misfish,2012-03-06 22:03:00,29133,"WE ALL KNEW THE TRUTH BACK 13 YRS AGO. BETTMANS A JOKE.We need Don Cherry in his place.  If you think not,your missing real HOCKEY."
673639,kickingfrog,2012-03-06 22:27:00,8333,"By only reading the quote listed I'm not sure if he meant letting the goal stand was the mistake or that the ""new"" interpretation of the rule for that season was the mistake. Both were a mistake, but he has made so many it's really hard to list a top ten."
673651,Gregoire,2012-03-06 23:14:00,1397,"If cherry had his way all the ontario teams would have ontario kids on them, the habs would only have quebeckers, the oilers and flames would have to split alberta talent and the Cancucks would have BC boys. I guess the rest of Canada would have to get teams as well, or else their boys would be stuck in the AHL... Cherry is as much of a joke as Bettman, he just makes people laugh in different ways."
