672978,Bing,2012-03-04 16:42:00,33,"Hi everyone, I am looking to go pickeral fishing on the May 24 weekend. Have been to Bay of Quinte last two years and was thinking of something differant this year. Any ideas?"
672991,esoxansteel,2012-03-04 17:08:00,1307,Nope no ideas
672996,mrpike,2012-03-04 17:25:00,151,For the MAY 24 WEEKEND  HEY BAY is the best place to go. You can't go wrong fishing the bay my friend. O and TRENTON IS very good also but alot of boats are on the water .
672998,Nipfisher,2012-03-04 17:34:00,2449,I know where you can find some walleye.
673001,lew,2012-03-04 18:03:00,12766,We fished Quinte most May 24 weekends for close to 50 years and I couldn't imagine going anywhere else.  Springtime pickeral & Bay of Quinte just go together like peanut butter & jam !!
673004,BillM,2012-03-04 18:23:00,17367,"Yup, Hay Bay on opener is a very good place if you after walters."

673050,pics,2012-03-04 21:16:00,1268,"Quinte for sure...and if ya have to go to the washroom, just jump from boat to boat till you hit shore.."
673076,Sinker,2012-03-04 22:28:00,8692,The kawartha's are another good choice. That's where I will be!  S.
673077,Old Man,2012-03-04 22:31:00,822, x 2 Or if your willing to fly in. Metionga
673131,Whopper,2012-03-05 02:13:00,2174,One of these years Simon  But for now I'll feel content driving by the Lac on my way to Little Vermilion
673159,Toad Hunter,2012-03-05 04:21:00,261,"try the east coast states ? as for walleye, cast a rod north of hwy 11 . (sarcasm)"
673176,wormdunker,2012-03-05 08:45:00,1711,Lake Erie for hawgs!
673179,Big Cliff,2012-03-05 09:46:00,6899,Fished Quinte for many years May 24 weekend. We use to fish by marker 46 off Big Island and always did well.
673185,Fish Farmer,2012-03-05 11:12:00,2234,"Your right Phil. I could never figure why most go on opening. I'd go the 2nd or 3rd week after, less boat traffic."
673188,woodenboater,2012-03-05 11:59:00,2277,Haven't gone myself on the 2/4 but friends do an annual trip and it's almost always the Lower French off Hartley Bay. They did well last year as did the bugs.
673204,pics,2012-03-05 14:01:00,1268,"I remember fishing Quinte during it's heyday before zebra mussels cleared the water....Mohawk Bay ,drifting in 7 feet of water over the sand and mud flats catching fish after fish....With high gas prices now, I stay closer to home and fish the grand..."
673483,Billy Bob,2012-03-06 12:51:00,5865,"I would think it would depend on what kind of presentation you like to use to catch Mr Walleye......smaller lakes will be good for casting minnow type baits after dark and jigging during the day which is my favorite type of fishing....The BOQ will be more trolling then anything, so if that's your thing return there. ....that's my least favorite way to catch walleyes.  GOOD LUCK, Bob"
673911,walleyejigger,2012-03-07 18:24:00,876,"i would say BOQ, do not, i repeat DO NOT head to northen ontario"
673994,Billy Bob,2012-03-07 22:04:00,5865,But where is the the northern line........
