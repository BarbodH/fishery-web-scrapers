587724,Lake Ranger,2011-05-29 12:51:00,70,"Hi Everyone, just a quick note to let you all know that Off The Dock made it into the Den to present a pitch to the Dragons! It was an amazing experience (we're sworn to secrecy about the outcome) however, it was incredible to actually be there, right in front of the Dragons and show them our toons! Although nervous, we felt confident and well prepared thanks to the producers and the entire crew of CBC who were so accomodating and extremely professional. Let's hope we were entertaining enough to make it to air for this upcoming season of the show. We won't know until 2 weeks prior to the air date, but we'll keep you posted! Phil was a real comedian, so I think we have a pretty good chance!"

It can be pretty intimidating going up in front of those folks when you know they are going to be hammering hard questions towards you.  Not to mention the dozen cameras.  Hopefully we can bring the fishing world to primetime TV if we get aired.  We'll see how its edited too.  Thanks again!"
