672280,Tybo,2012-03-02 21:52:00,1373," It's basically for cruising speed.The 90 doesn't need to use as much HP to cruise at 38mph,less fuel.where the 60 is wot. Also since you are putting more toque to the water the higher the boat will ride.Less friction better fuel. Engines that don't work as hard usually last longer."
672281,Sinker,2012-03-02 21:52:00,8692,"I have a pull start 40hp tiller....only one I've ever seen. It starts up no problem with half a pull. My kids can't get it started though, so until they can, they can't take the boat!  S."
672285,Sinker,2012-03-02 21:56:00,8692,"My boat is rated for a 40, and I have a 40 on it. I would love to put a 60 on it, because I've been in a few situations where I could have used the extra ponies. Like running from a storm with a fully loaded boat. I can get it up on plane in rough water, but she's working hard. The 60 would have we with a little extra jam just in case I needed it. You can never go wrong with more power.  A 20 horse will burn quite a bit less gas than a 25. For the extra 5hp, I'd just get the 20. Tha'ts more than enough power for that boat, and waterbody.   S."
672298,beertech,2012-03-02 22:26:00,118,I have a 9.9 4stroke merc as a kicker motor on my big boat.  I find once warm it is hard to start. friend has same motor and same problem.  I am thinking 4 stroke 20 as im asuming it will troll better than a two stroke.    
673629,beertech,2012-03-06 21:49:00,118,hey everyone just an update.  I found a 25hp merc 2stroke.  do you think it will be too much when i try to troll with it  
673631,FishAbout,2012-03-06 21:54:00,106,It will troll fine but will shake and be smelly.  You will use a lot more fuel then the 4 stroke though.  Overall the 25 two stroke is a great motor. My cousin has well over 2000 hours on his.
673720,tomO,2012-03-07 01:50:00,363,"I've got a 94 25 merc on my 16ft. john boat it's been a really good motor I bought it new,it trolls down to 1 mph and top speed is about 23 on the gps with two people."
673736,GYPSY400,2012-03-07 03:05:00,191,"  I have a 2010 legend 16ft prosport with a 30 2-stroke Merc on it.. It trolls FAST!! There is no way I could get it down to walleye trolling speeds.. The 25 and 30 2-strokes are pretty much the same engine so I can only assume the same.  My advise is (depending on your budget) since your going to be by yourself ""most"" of the time your best bet is the 20 4 stroke..  A 15 will do with 1, but will be underpowered with 2 or more..although it will troll nice.. A 25 will rock with 2 ( my 30 on the 16ft does 50km/h and hull weight is over 500lbs)... But it will troll fast.. So a 20 should be the good compromise..  As far as trolling, a 55lb electric trolling motor is a very, very wise purchase.. Trolling speed with that is anywhere from barely moving in a headwind, to matching the trolling speed on the gas engine.. And it's quiet!!"
673759,FishAbout,2012-03-07 03:41:00,106,"The 25 should troll fine if the idol is set up right on the carb, I fish in my cousins 14 foot princecraft with a 25 merc and it trolls slow enough for spring salmon in owen sound.  A four stroke will troll faster then a 2 stroke in most cases."
672076,beertech,2012-03-02 03:29:00,118,im planning on buying this boat.  http://www.polarkraftboats.com/boats/Dakota-V-1470-L  wondering whether i should get a 15 or 20hp motor for it
672085,Dabluz,2012-03-02 03:43:00,701,  20 h.p.
672086,Nipfisher,2012-03-02 03:44:00,2449,I didn't even look at the boat and I can say without a doubt get the 20. Max. it out on the motor rating. You will kick yourself if you dont.
672087,mike rousseau,2012-03-02 03:44:00,4661,Depends what you wanna get out of it... I put a 25 on a small 14 footer... It boogied... But I almost flipped it because it was too much power when there wasn't a passenger in the front...  Do you fish alone most of the time... 2 in the boat... 3 in the boat...?  You can always run half throttle on a bigger motor... Then you have the power if you need it... The 15 wouldn't give you that option...
672095,ChrisK,2012-03-02 04:07:00,2772,I'd go 20 horse. You can put a bigger motor on it but it makes it tuff getting out of the hole even when running half throttle. Turning corners wide open with a small boat/bigger motor can get pretty hairy as well especially when there's a chop on the water. Best slow it down a little and be safe.
672102,John Bacon,2012-03-02 04:37:00,3277,"Will you be trailering and leaving the motor attached? If so, I would go with a 20hp or 25hp. If you will be removing the motor on a regular basis that I would consider a 15hp for the lighter weight."
672103,DRIFTER_016,2012-03-02 04:52:00,10439,I would go with a 20 or 25 on it.
672108,danc,2012-03-02 05:36:00,4677," I've read this ""max it out"" theory many times on here. I have a Lund Pro Sport that is rated for 90 hp, but I have a 60 on it. It gives me great hole shot, 38 mph (depending on which prop I use), and trolls down to next to nothing. Not to mention the fuel savings. So tell what I'm missing by not having a 90 hp? I'm really looking forward to the answer."
672113,pikehunter,2012-03-02 10:48:00,1659,"If the motor manufacturer you are considering makes a 25 then put a 25 on it. If they don't, but only make a 20 then go for that. The 15, like was said is OK if you are constantly taking it off, but I wouldn't do that, especially if it's a 4 stroke. Put a masterlock motor lock on the clamps and bolt it in through the transom and put one of those locking bolts in.  You won't regret going for the larger option."
672114,scugpg,2012-03-02 11:02:00,1373,I'd go with a 20 four stroke. Its much lighter than a 25 as most of those are triple cylinders.
672116,fishindevil,2012-03-02 11:27:00,6254,"well if you decide on what kind of fishing are you going to do wityh it the most both 14ft boats i have had one had a 25 four stroke,and one had a 15 2 stroke,and for trolling for walleyes the 15 was way better trolled right down,but if you are not going to be using it for trolling,go with the maxumum hp !!!!"
672120,pikehunter,2012-03-02 11:45:00,1659," No they aren't. Some yes, Johnson 2005 2 stroke is a 2 cyl. as are many others. I believe Mercs are also 2 cyl. OMC did at one time have a 3 cyl 25 hp motor and I think Suzuki did too."
672123,scugpg,2012-03-02 12:05:00,1373," as I noted above I was talking about 4 strokes...looks like they are split down the middle 2 vs 3cyl, but weight is a big difference  Merc 25 157 Merc 20 115  Yamaha 25 170 Yamaha 20 114  Honda 25 155 Honda 20 104  The Honda 20 4 stroke is a great choice due to its lightweight."
672144,NAW,2012-03-02 13:30:00,4022,"20 or a 25.  I ran a 25 on my 14.  I've also run a 15, and 9.9 on the same boat.  You can alway back off the throttle if you need to.  But when it's calm and flat, it sure is nice to have the extra top end speed.  Also, I camp a lot.  With a boat loaded down, it sure is nice to be able to plane out.  Specially when you're racing for a spot on the Thursday of a long weekend!"
672158,pikehunter,2012-03-02 13:48:00,1659," Looks like a good choice, wonder if that weight is for a long or short shaft with electric start? If it is then for sure, as this can add a few extra pounds. Also an electric start, although nice does unfortunatly add even more weight because of the battery.  Buddy put a Honda 40 on his boat last year, sweet motor."
672160,Roe Bag,2012-03-02 13:52:00,246,"My buddy has the same boat. He runs a 25 Yamaha two stroke on it.  A big consideration is weight. 20 Yamaha four stroke weighs in at 114 lbs. (dry weight) 25 Yamaha four stroke weighs in at 181 lbs. (dry weight) 25 Yamaha two stroke weighs the same as the 20 four stroke. 114 lbs.  A 25 four stroke on a 15"" transom is just asking for trouble. Quick stops or backtroling and you'll have water slopping over the back end, into the boat. Supposedly Honda makes the lightest 25 four stroke at 155 lbs. (short shaft) 160 lbs (long) Hope this helps."
672168,Nipfisher,2012-03-02 14:09:00,2449,"  60hp - 90hp is a big difference compared to 15hp -20hp. My starcraft is rated for up to 115hp and I have a 90 on it. I would love to have the 115hp even if it is heavier and uses more fuel. I need to get off the lake in a hurry sometimes and Lake Nipissing can get dirty.   From what I have read....the maximum hp is ""reccomended by the manufacturer"".  I had a buddy buy a 15' Legend at the boat show last year and he asked several ""experts"" at the show about HP rating. He ended up pairing it with the maximum rated hp.    Maybe Craig Ritchie can comment for us?    There is alot of info on the net that argues both ways."
672171,bigbuck,2012-03-02 14:18:00,2449,A 20 will be plenty. More than that they get kinda heavy and it's a fairly small boat so weight is a consideration.
672176,Ralph Field,2012-03-02 14:34:00,1018,I ran a 25 on my 14 footer and it was scary fast on flat water. Each boat has a manufacturers plate on the transom with the largest recommended motor size for the boat. I would follow that guideline and if it states 20HP max then that is what I would go with.
672181,Raf,2012-03-02 14:48:00,3495,"i started with a 30 on my 14.5 (carpet/seats/deck) then moved to a 40.  the 40 is nicer because it does not have to work as hard (ie. more fuel efficient in the end since i can run it at a lower rpm to maintain the same speed), easier out of the hole. i think top speed is a function of hull design (as well as HP obviously) - top end wise there is a difference between 30/40 (32-33mph empty vs 37-39 empty) but the biggest difference is that i can keep that same speed loaded down with gear and a passenger where with the 30 the difference between loaded and unloaded was greater."
672184,blue pickeral,2012-03-02 14:53:00,267,"Buy what hp you think, but would advise an electric start option. Got a manual start on a kicker hoping to save money, but shoulder went bad, and have a hard time pulling the starter now."
672185,beertech,2012-03-02 14:59:00,118,"thanks for the imput.  I will not be trailering it.  It will be staying at a cottage on pigeon lake. I was looking at for strokes,  Yamaha or merc 15 or 20s..   I was leaning towards the 20 as the merc has electric start yamaha does not.  worried the four strokes might be hard to start.  I will be fishing more alone than not. thanks for the imput everyone."
672188,12footspringbok,2012-03-02 15:10:00,459,For what its worth my buddy bought a brand new 20hp short shaft yamaha for his 14ft boat similar to the one you're looking at last summer. Pull start is really easy on the yamaha alot easier than we thought it would be. The boat is fine with 2 of us in it. Tops out around 20mph flat calm. With 3 in the boat it struggles to stay on plane...LOL  Anyways thought I'd throw in my 2 cents...
672193,DRIFTER_016,2012-03-02 15:40:00,10439,"  The four strokes aren't any harder to start than a 2 stroke. We have had 30hp Merc 4 stroke pull start motors at the lodge on Great Bear for quite a few years. If they are maintained they start first or second pull. However, having electric start is a huge bonus as you will have a battery and charging system which will mean you have power to run lights, fishfinder, radio etc. If it were me I would go with the electric start 20hp Merc."
672196,12footspringbok,2012-03-02 16:01:00,459, Just so you know the pull start yamaha has the charging system option as well.
