673826,Hud,2012-03-07 13:09:00,140,love it.   I've had an Ugly Stick for almost 10 years now and while not a high end rod man it is solid.  It's been on lots of long trips and should have broken many times by now.  Hell I'll probably have it until I retire
673833,Old Man,2012-03-07 13:20:00,822,"Still have mine after 25 years.  They are one tough rod, but that's about all I can say about it. Doesn't see much use anymore since I've found a lot of other rods I like way better."
673838,pikehunter,2012-03-07 13:37:00,1659,"Had an Ugly Stike Lite, it did break, actually the reel seat broke. I liked it and caught quite a few walleye, bass and perch with it. Some day I might get another. For those that say Ugly Sticks are too bulky or heavy should have a look at the ""Lite"" version."
