673802,hawk-eye,2012-03-07 07:07:00,141,Camillj  You my friend are that part of this Country's culture that has been lost forever. I sure miss the days when people can be trusted and counted on. Thanks for trying to keep it alive Jon.
673804,EC1,2012-03-07 07:25:00,930,"Damn, that stinks. Hope you find the thieves!"
673806,Handlebarz,2012-03-07 10:14:00,3790,that sucks big time I hope they get what is coming to them.  We had the same thing happen to us but it was a little different we had a 14X14 shack and waited to long the ice along shore was getting to crappy for us to pull it off so we took it apart and brought the roof section home when we got back the rest of it was gone but all the couches and empty's were left right there what a joke we were young maybe 18 or so and were not happy some one got a lot of lumber to build there own shack for the next season we never saw the pieces again Heck they even stole the steel door.
673808,Big Cliff,2012-03-07 10:21:00,6899,I just don't understand how down and desperate someone has to be to steal from others like that. Would be nice to see them caught! Did you file a police report?
673842,camillj,2012-03-07 13:52:00,1988,"OK .. lets clear it up ... I'm not totally STUPID ... I left two ""wire"" contraptions I call rods (which basically are an upgrade to the old-school willow twigs stuck in the snow ....I made them to clamp onto base plates which I ""freeze"" into the ice beside the two holes inside the hut... they are worth about $2 bucks each (and I have made 10 more for larger GTG's) ... but I leave em in the hut because it is a real pain to set em up the first time and if you go in the hut you just clip on your line and you are fishin in seconds ... I only mention that the rods were gone (but the bases were still there) because that makes me more certain it was stolen not blown away in the wind.  I DID lug all my other stuff  (although I cant remember if I left 'em a $10 folding chair)  And no hawk-eye hopefully it IS NOT dead ... I think there are MANY folks in this group who think the same way (at least I like to believe that)."
673851,limeyangler,2012-03-07 14:12:00,5204, Try getting out of the city once in awhile.
673868,COUNTRYBOY,2012-03-07 15:51:00,130,THEY SHOULD USE SAUDI LAW IF CAUGHT
673908,walleyejigger,2012-03-07 18:18:00,876,"it still amazes me how low some people will go, hope you recover it"
674019,hawk-eye,2012-03-07 23:22:00,141," I do not live in the city, at least not the big one. Born and raised farm boy. My career has force me to work in the city wich is why I choose to have a 125km commute to work. I found that this is the closest I get get while remaining in the Canada I grew up in.  But even in the smaller towns here in southern Ontario the days of trusting your neighbors are just about gone.  Tight lines everyone."
674193,tonyb,2012-03-08 14:17:00,1637,"If you can't find a good deal on eBay or at your local tackle retailer  , Cabelas happens to have an attractive offer on them right now.  6x6 Pop-up Ice Hut - $129"
674197,camillj,2012-03-08 14:34:00,1988,Wow ... that IS a great deal ! ... I already ordered one off ebay (not nearly as good a deal .. but hey .. its on its way now) - but thanks for the info !
673653,camillj,2012-03-06 23:25:00,1988,RANT ON  If ya happen to see a 4 Man Ice Cube ... with the numbers BR5320 (hopefully they are too dumb to take the numbers off it) ... ask em where they got it  I musta told 50 different guys to go right ahead and use it if they needed to when I wasnt there ... just please leave it like you found it ...  Jeeze ... you would think they could just use it and leave it be ... got up to Lake Joe this weekend .. thought I had everything all set up and ready to go for a little group GTG and ... the hut was gone ... tooks the rods too  I was kinda hoping maybe someone 'borrowed it' and was gonna bring it back .. call me naive and I know .. I guess I should know better ... but honestly I just refuse to let arses change the way I behave ... next year there will be another one right there in the same spot ... hopefully they wont need another more than I do  RANT OFF
673656,Rod Caster,2012-03-06 23:29:00,5784,"I hope you recover it. That's really low! I must say I like your line ""I refuse to let arses change the way I behave""."
673657,Pikeslayer,2012-03-06 23:31:00,1443,"That really bites. Really bites. If you find out who stole it, I will kill them dead for you. No charge, no questions. Honestly,  Slayer"
673658,Jer,2012-03-06 23:32:00,1426,"Is that a portable pop-up? If you left it unattended, I wouldn't be surprised if it blew away."
673659,lew,2012-03-06 23:34:00,12766,"That really stinks Jon, sure hope you find the punk that stole  your gear."
673661,Frank,2012-03-06 23:38:00,74,"That's a disgrace. People I have only met once have give'n me the go ahead to use their huts when I want and I have never thought about stealing a hook from their huts, never mind the entire hut. That truly is an all time low. Hope you find you're hut."
673662,camillj,2012-03-06 23:40:00,1988, Nope .. it was secured with a 2X4 UNDER the ice tied with a rope to the main frame ... and we got up there before the 100KM winds hit  Also .. there was no sign of my rods - which were secured to base plates ... but the base plates (which were frozen into the ice - were still there (but clearly hacked up from someone chipping away to get em out unsuccessfully).  It is what it is ... and like I said I just needed a little rant ... I'm heading over to ebay right now to replace it for next year ... I absolutely wont let thiefs and jerks ruin my outlook on fishing (or life) ... I like to leave my stuff all set up so when i get there I am ready to GO !!!!!  (ok .. maybe I am just lazy)
673663,Joey,2012-03-06 23:41:00,9122,Man that totally sucks.  Hope you find it or it gets returned.
673665,jayess,2012-03-06 23:43:00,187,"that sucks dude... but your outlook is very honorable. spread that spirit, brother!"
673667,limeyangler,2012-03-06 23:44:00,5204,  i dont want to make light of your plight...but that comment was just class...optimism at its best!  Sorry to hear about your news...thats really low. I'm with Slayer on this one!  
673670,misfish,2012-03-06 23:53:00,29133,"Years back, when had a hut,I would not have a lock on it(cause it would get broke off,like many times before) I would leave a note on the wall. Feal free to use,theres minnows in the bucket,just pull up the chain. HAVE A GOOD TIME. All I ask is please dont leave a mess.TY  Pretty much, it was left as I left it.  Then again,it was a shelter,with a hole to fish out of from the elements. I left nothing behind.  Sorry to hear you got robbed.  RESPECT SEEMS TO BE A THING OF THE PAST. SHAME."
673671,NAW,2012-03-06 23:54:00,4022,"Sorry to here about that.  Maybe Simcoe has jadded me a little, but I would never leave a portable hut un-attended on the ice overnight.  They're way to easy to steel.  Specially would not have left any gear in it.  On Simcoe, they'll break into anything. And if the find anything of value, it's gone.  Leaving a portable out on the ice un-attended is just asking for it down here.  By Lake Joe, I'm assuming the one in Muskoka?  Not that far north.  With the unsafe ice on Simcoe, the theifs must be moving north to get their quota."
673673,misfish,2012-03-07 00:01:00,29133,"  No matter portable or perm. It,s just the matter of WHY.   :wallbash:  :wallbash:"
673677,Black_Blade,2012-03-07 00:06:00,258,"I really don't know how these types of people can live with themselves.  Must have had a horrible upbringing maybe and taught no respect.  A fishing hut is the same to me and probably most others, as a cabin or a camper's set-up...you just don't touch other peoples stuff in those situations ( well at any time..lol).  For me I just picked up this code of ethics from many times outdoors with my father and its totally alien for me to think otherwise."
673696,camillj,2012-03-07 00:37:00,1988,Well .. all's well that ends well ... I found/bought this one on ebay a few minutes ago .... http://www.ebay.com/itm/ws/eBayISAPI.dll?ViewItem&item=280834188652 ... if you see it out on APPIAN way please use it .... at least that should deter the frigggggen theives
673699,Ralph Field,2012-03-07 00:42:00,1018,There are many people that do not respect other people's property rights today. The people that stole your hut I would bet are not the ones that you told to use your hut when you weren't around. I'm told that there are people that look for equipment to steal out of cars parked at popular fishing spots. I wish you luck recovering your hut and as others have said you have the right attitude.
673702,GbayGiant,2012-03-07 00:46:00,1780,Mactierites would have had it off the base before you got home.
673704,irishfield,2012-03-07 00:50:00,26272,"One trust worthy bugger Jon! Those days are gone... except for a few spots well North where guys still leave their spud bars hanging outside the huts, propane bottles and shovels as well.. and nobody touches them.  Feel bad.. that money you forked out a week back could have been used for the replacement hut! (but Jen is having a great time on the goal line in Boston's end.. staring at Thomas's right shoulder!   )"
673706,FishAbout,2012-03-07 00:54:00,106,"That hut was there for over 2 weeks before someone took it, wish i could say the wind blow it away but it was there last wed and gone thrusday moring."
673707,camillj,2012-03-07 00:55:00,1988, Hahahahahah ... man .. you have no idea .. I just spat a $200 XO Cognac all over my keyboard .. you are soOOO on the money !
673708,camillj,2012-03-07 00:57:00,1988,  MONEY COMES AND IT GOES MY FRIEND .. BUT TIMES LIKE THESE ARE ONCE IN A LIFETIME .. JUST THRILLED TO HAVE BEEN A PART OF IT !  GO LEAFS GO !!!!
673712,Roy,2012-03-07 01:27:00,13728,Oh that's right! That's tonight's game! Hope they're really enjoying it.
673715,Live2fish85,2012-03-07 01:33:00,1633,"That sucks big time. Happened to me last year when we walked out around a bay.  As for leaving your rods and that in a hut you leave out all season that is stupid. With all the arssholes out there I am suprised you do that. I can see leaving the hut but thats it. I dont leave my tackle or anything in my boat which is in my parents back yard in the water.  Hope you find the morons that took it though. I have no respect for loser. Most likely they will leave the numbers on to, thieves are to dumb."
673719,solopaddler,2012-03-07 01:46:00,8605, Was going to make a similar comment. I lived in Port Carling for a couple of years and wouldn't have dreamed of leaving a portable hut set up on the ice with gear in it no less.  There's no excusing the theft and I do feel your pain.....but man that was an open invitation.
673796,bramptonjerry,2012-03-07 05:31:00,132,"I have a trailer on the French...no locks...with thousands of dolars of gear in it, don't lock the doors of my home...if I ever get robbed, it's time to move, that's the way I'm going to live, and that's the way it should be"
