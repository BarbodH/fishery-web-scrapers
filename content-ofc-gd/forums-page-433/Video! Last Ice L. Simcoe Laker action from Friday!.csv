673922,Slayingm,2012-03-07 19:03:00,204,Brutal year for being able to get out onto my GPS spots on Simcoe for Laker's and Whitefish. The spot I got a 20lb Laker the week prior was open water!! but this secondary spot in 57 Ft and good ice still proved to produce some nice fish for a last outing on the main lake!... Enjoy!... Greg.
