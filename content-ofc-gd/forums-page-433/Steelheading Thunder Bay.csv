673942,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2012-03-07 19:40:00,0,It's not too early but I would be prepared to fish a vast array of river conditions at that time of year and make sure you have some spoons for the river mouths.  Contact D+R Outdoors in T-Bay and I'm sure they can hook you up with a guide.
673980,rock34,2012-03-07 21:46:00,215,"Thanks Man. I called them.  They have no guides but are more than willing to point me to a few rivers which is really all that I need.  Long story short, that was helpful.  Thanks!"

674147,TDunn,2012-03-08 05:39:00,680,"Usually at that time the rivers are still locked. Last year my first hot day in the waders was on april 19th.  Seems we are a few weeks ahead of time, so you might luck out. As mentioned if the rivers are still locked up, hit the mouths.  Another option is to stop in the Soo and fish the rapids if your driving .... or just go ice fishing in TBay!  Good luck and enjoy!   TDunn"
674166,rock34,2012-03-08 12:07:00,215," Thanks man.  Im hoping some sections are open,otherwise like has been suggest I will hit the river mouths.  Thanks for all the help guys.  If anyone ones to point me in a direction feel free to PM me for sure.  Otherwise Im just going to be following a map and asking some locals!"
