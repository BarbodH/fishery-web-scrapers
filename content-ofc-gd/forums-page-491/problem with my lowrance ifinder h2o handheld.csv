Marked a few spots and most recent use of it was in winter while fishing a new lake I marked my location and my truck incase there was a storm or somethin, I could get to shore.  So, after that, the batteries came out and I hadn't turned it on till summer. When I did, the display came on upside down, and backwards... The unit works perfectly fine, shows all the info and maps, but its upsidedown and backwards. Making it virtually useless.  Anyone experience this, or better yet have a solution?!"
620402,Terry,2011-09-11 23:49:00,14456,you can try this    1. Turn unit OFF 2. Press and hold the PAGES key 3. Press and hold the PWR key 4. Release both buttons when the USA map appears  ......................................................................................    or turn the batteries around...LOL
620416,mbac31,2011-09-12 00:31:00,904,Knowing this guy I can only assume its user error for sure. Call Lawren Wetzel @ radioworld or Jason Gilstrap from BBC boards. They will have you fixed in a jiffy. I have the same unit but have never managed to do that.
620462,uglyfish,2011-09-12 02:10:00,981,"Lol thanks marvin. Ill get ahold of one of them.  And it wasn't user error... Jackass. Lol  All I can think is maybe the little guy dropping it and somethin screwed up.  And terry, I did both a hard and soft reset and still nuthin."
