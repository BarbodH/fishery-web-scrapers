620112,Blue Lk,2011-09-10 16:22:00,337,"The weather here is unbelievable for Sept. GF & I decided to give ""Secret Lk"" another visit before the temps dropped back to normal. This little lake is about 1/2 hour from my place & is home to lots of smaller ""eatin size"" walleye.      The stringer of eyes is the result of about 45 minutes of fishing. We were off the lake early so back home for a dip.     Just had to post so Simon knows that he isn't the only guy in the area who can catch a fish or 2  "
620115,Nipfisher,2011-09-10 16:50:00,2449,Good looking stringer of eyes. Tough when it take 45 minutes to catch your limit eh? I wish the fishing was better up there for you guys  .
620154,rufus,2011-09-10 21:08:00,267,"Clear water, walleye, and no cottages on the lake - paradise!"
620185,Leecher,2011-09-10 23:55:00,7832,Got to love it when you can limit out on eyes in record time and just half an hour away Thanks for sharing Leechman
620236,limeyangler,2011-09-11 03:28:00,5204,Rick...Rick...Rick.....everybody can tell thats the same bloody picture of that stringer you keep reposting   Nice catch dude....and you are a lucky man living on blue Lake...that water looks soooooo nice....even nicer considering how hot its been here the last week or so.
620238,Rod Caster,2011-09-11 03:33:00,5784,Nice chain pickeral  A full stringer with time to spare. Awesome!
620425,manjo39,2011-09-12 00:50:00,354,  Exactly what I was thinking.  Usually clear water and good fishing do not go hand in hand.  The water looks beautiful!
620428,RickOnt,2011-09-12 01:02:00,669,SWEEEET!!   Very Nice!!  WOW!!   I Wish   Rick
620452,Blue Lk,2011-09-12 01:54:00,337," Two different lakes,the eyes came from a lake 1/2 hr away from home. The clear water is home,not only some cottages & homes but also a prov park. Sorry for the confusion."
620555,TennesseeGuy,2011-09-12 12:36:00,957,"I may have observed you launching your boat at ""Secret Lake"".  Do you drive a black, F-150?"
620611,Blue Lk,2011-09-12 14:45:00,337," No,not me.Nobody at this ""Secret Lk"" but us,I haven't seen anybody else there for a couple years. The atv trail to the lake is getting very grown in so I know the lk is seeing very few fishermen."
