620079,aplumma,2011-09-10 12:27:00,6896,Just a heads up if you want a good solid reel at a great price Cabelas has a flyer out for the 2012 line and has all of the Chronachs for a new lower price of 199.00 USD. I am not sure if it is more up North but look for the price to drop its one of my favorite reels.   Art
620093,uglyfish,2011-09-10 13:53:00,981,They are the same price in canada. Although they are so much uglier than the old models and the graphite body is a step down too
620094,Bernie66,2011-09-10 13:58:00,123,The reviews of the Chronach E so far has not been stellar.  Check out some US sites.  They said its a down grade from the last generation. Lots of plastic parts.  Many negative customer reviews. Sorry to rain on your parade.
620127,Dan668,2011-09-10 19:00:00,1120,Ya cause its the old curado painted a different colour. I bought the old curado off tacklewarehouse during their labour day sale for 100 (no duties too  ) Same reel
620161,aplumma,2011-09-10 21:36:00,6896,Thats a shame I am glad to get the input. I have a few of the older series and they are a great reel. I guess at this time the deal looks less than a deal.   Art
620167,fish_fishburn,2011-09-10 22:06:00,1311,"I was checking them out today. They have the same body and look identical except the colour. My first impression ... not to impressed. The Chronarch is a 100 bucks cheaper than the 11 models. They feel cheap, if you know what I mean. I'm gonna wait till I read more reviews. I'm glad I picked up a new Curado 300 and a Chronarch this year."
620170,Garry2Rs,2011-09-10 22:11:00,1425,"From what I read the new Chronarch is a slight improvement on the old Corado, at close to the same price.  This all has to do with the falling US dollar.  If you liked the last Corado, the new Chronarch will be even better, but it isn't an aluminum bodied Core, like the last model was. Garry2R's"
