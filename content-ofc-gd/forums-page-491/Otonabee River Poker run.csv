They start in Bewdley, go to Hastings and come up the Otonabee almost to Peterborough. I don't know where the other stops are, but if its a poker run I assume they have two more stops somewhere.  Keep your hooks sharp!  Monster    "
620333,archer379,2011-09-11 19:17:00,277,The boats are cool and fast but really the river is to small and to busy I have heard of stories of people getting swamped while out in smaller craft. I thought I was earlier in the year but maybe the moved it until a time with less traffic on the water
620337,mbac31,2011-09-11 19:30:00,904,"I still have no idea how these guys are allowed to run in that river like that. The lake, fine but I witnessed these idiots last year swamp a canoe without any regard for anyones life. I gave them a hand to get bac in but that river is very small in areas and these guys are side by side sometimes."

620361,lew,2011-09-11 21:29:00,12766,I used to fish that stretch of water quite abit and when a group of large boats came thru together it could get very rough. Can only imagine what it'd be like with 30 of those guys running up one behind the other.
620367,Pigeontroller,2011-09-11 21:49:00,2793,Waste of gas...Those boats do not belong anywhere except the Ocean or Great Lakes!
