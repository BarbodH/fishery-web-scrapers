The only problem I have now is that in the Waypoint list in it, I cannot copy and paste from it, thus no converting it into a text file. Has anyone out there used this utility?  hey Fang..... I am trying, you shouldnt have bought a Humminbird!!!LOL  Darren"
619445,ld17,2011-09-08 02:29:00,319,I just highlight the waypoint you want to copy and then go to file and save as and save it to where you want.  I hope this is what you were after.

620775,bucktail,2011-09-12 21:32:00,1857,     Allows me to save where ever I want but I cant find a function to save them as txt files.  I must be overlooking something
