620335,deova,2011-09-11 19:27:00,9,Can anyone tell me if this lake is stocked with lakers and how the fishing is using down riggers?  What kind of lures work best?  Thanks

620356,irishfield,2011-09-11 21:11:00,26272,Silver Lake is a stocked lake and is open all year for Lakers. Not a big enough hole out there to worry about using riggers. Jig for them...
