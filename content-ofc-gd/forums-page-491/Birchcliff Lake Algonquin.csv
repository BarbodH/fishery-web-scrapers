620193,brkygetr,2011-09-11 00:27:00,425,Working on the spring Algonquin trip and thinking about staying in one of the interior cabins. I think we are just getting lazier and want a shelter when we get there!!! Anyways we have been researching Birchcliff Lake and was wondering if anyone has been. Saying that we are getting lazy is not quite accurate as we are going to try to make it to camp in a day and from all I've read thats going to be REAL tough...hence the shelter when we get there. Anyways going to stay a week and hit up any small lakes in the area and do a wee bushwacking. If anyone has any insight or other cabin options let me know.  thanks  Dale

Its doable in a day but we use a motor from Access 1 to Bigger and then lock it to a tree to get you there quicker. If water is low in the creek the going can be tough. It's a lot of work BECAUSE THERE IS NO FISH THERE
