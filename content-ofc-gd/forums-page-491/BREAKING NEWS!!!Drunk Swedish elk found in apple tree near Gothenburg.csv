620065,Roy,2011-09-10 09:31:00,13728,That moose is just gunna hit the next apple orchard and go on another binge. I wonder how many people would have saved the tree and cut the mooses legs off? I know that up north here someone would have had meat in the freezer and apples in the tree again next year. *insert icon of choice here*
