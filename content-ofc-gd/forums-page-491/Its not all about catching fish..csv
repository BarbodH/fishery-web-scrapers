Its just nice being out there with him. He is such a lovely person, great sense of humour, amazing imagination and great company...all wrapped up in a small, curly, redhead package.    <iframe width=""560"" height=""345"" src=""http://www.youtube.com/embed/2oMKkqFSSOc"" frameborder=""0"" allowfullscreen></iframe>                            "

PS. give him a couple years, and you will be amazed at how he can outfish you on any given outing.  Kids have that special touch!  cheers"

I have allways believed that if you show them the way in their younger years,they will remember & take you with them in later years. So far this has worked with myself & my 2 adult sons. Great report & a great job being a father."
