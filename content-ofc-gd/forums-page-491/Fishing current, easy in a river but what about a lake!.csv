620023,NAW,2011-09-10 01:30:00,4022,Great pics Wayne.  That's cool some cool stuff.
620033,NBR,2011-09-10 02:01:00,163,Several years ago we were going to meet friends at Manitoulin Island. We came through Tobermorey and were a bit early so in driving around we went across the bridge to the main land towards Espanola. As we crossed the bridge I looked down and the current looked like it was flowing west on one side of the bridge island and east on the other. We were low on gas so I stopped and as the guy was pumping my gas I asked him if I was crazy or what. He said nope. When he was a kid there were days they could go down current on one side of the bridge swim cross current to the other side and the go back the other direction riding the current.  I asked why he said the only thing he had ever heard it was caused by wind and condition out on Huron south of Manitoulin.
620088,whitbyboatguy,2011-09-10 13:09:00,130," The direction of the swirl may have something to do with that but something else is causing this to happen. There might even be a hole at the bottom of Georgian Bay!   yes, those are neat pictures, I don't remember seeing that before on a small - medium scale like that."
620177,Canuck,2011-09-10 22:57:00,491,"I think Wayne found the drain the US government installed to drain Georgian Bay into the Midwest US!  Now we know where the water is going. Next time you fly over, throw a few rocks in to plug her up!"
619939,irishfield,2011-09-09 21:37:00,26272,"I've only seen this twice in 20 years... so thought I'd better photograph it today. Pretty easy to read current in a river, but on something as large as Georgian Bay.. not so easy. I got out for my first flight of the year today and man did I need that enjoyment. Anyhow...if anyone wonders what has salmon holding up in a specific spot every year before they run the local rivers... it's current and the food it brings for free.  This is water between 15 and 30 Fathoms deep (90 to 180 FOW). First it spins counter clock wise, straightens out to pass the island and then it spins counter clock wise again! (or is that clockwise.. I'm assuming a direction of flow) A neat thing to see for sure... looks like pools in the Niagara, but in slow motion! (Either that or some yahoo was driving in circles before I got out there!   )  If you know where this is fine and lets leave it at that..... if not well it's a good salmon spot with long rigger cables.              And for bonus points.... someone tell me where this lighthouse is  "
619942,Musky or Specks,2011-09-09 21:43:00,2710,Those points off those islands are going to be great musky feeding areas
619943,irishfield,2011-09-09 21:54:00,26272,Yep.. they're just sitting there snacking on all them Salmon going round and round !
619945,spincast,2011-09-09 21:59:00,3279,"Fantastic- glad to hear you got out for a quick flight Wayne - been a long hard year for ya. You earned them wings today To answer the question on the light house -- Not sure, but it looks like a great place to be fishin today! Wish I was there"
619946,irishfield,2011-09-09 22:01:00,26272,"If I hadn't had the younger daughter with me at that point (I texted her.. dropped in and landed, picked her up and blasted back off without shutting down).. I think I would have landed out there, then broke out the survival rod and tackle in the back of the plane!"
619947,mercman,2011-09-09 22:04:00,7054,"Excellent pics Wayne What causes current like that? We dont think of the Great lakes and Georgian bay as a river, but i guess being part of the St Lawerence system, they really are."
619948,BassMan11,2011-09-09 22:04:00,583,Great shots irishfield. Very interesting looking water. Glad you got out for a trip. I saw your plane last year when i was in Temagami at what i assume is your cottage around this time last year. Shes a beaut.
619949,irishfield,2011-09-09 22:07:00,26272," Hell we get tides in the sound Paul, some days as much as 2 feet. Some from moon pull, mainly from wind push. No wind today.. so I can only summize that it's the NUMEROUS rivers flowing into GBay and all that water has to get around structure causing the ""pools""."
619952,irishfield,2011-09-09 22:09:00,26272,"Thanks.. that would be correct, about 4 islands out from town.. I built her with me own two hands between 1993 and 1995. The floats in 2004."
619953,Roy,2011-09-09 22:10:00,13728, Say what?  Please say that you're not saying that GB is a river.
619954,irishfield,2011-09-09 22:11:00,26272,A big wide one Roy!
619956,Musky or Specks,2011-09-09 22:15:00,2710,I was thinking whitefish and cisco's but having seen them wack wishmaster baits I'm sure a small salmon isn't off the menu
619973,wallacio,2011-09-09 23:08:00,475,  That's the Western Islands Light.
619974,irishfield,2011-09-09 23:13:00,26272,It certainly is... would have been a lonely miserable place living in the house that use to sit on that cement foundation! 
619976,Terry,2011-09-09 23:14:00,14456,cool shots I will be fishing muskie on Gbay tomorrow
619977,irishfield,2011-09-09 23:15:00,26272,Gee.. thanks for the invite!
619979,Terry,2011-09-09 23:21:00,14456,well my boat is small but we could squeeze you in.....
619981,wallacio,2011-09-09 23:22:00,475," No kidding!  It's no wonder that lots of stories about mysterious murders surround so many of Ontario's lighthouses.   ""All work and no play makes Jack a dull boy..."""
619982,irishfield,2011-09-09 23:27:00,26272,LOL... 20 Nautical Miles out from Penetang Harbour. I imagine many days the waves roll right over that rock and there would have been a lot of sleepless nights out there. First time I've ventured out there in about a decade.
619989,Sharkbait22,2011-09-09 23:54:00,297,That's a great couple of photos.  I think the cause might be the rotation of the earth.  Same thing happens with air massess - and there's no rivers there.  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coriolis_effect  Does that explain what you see.  I don't know the area.
619996,vinnimon,2011-09-10 00:19:00,2593,"Nice photo shots and observation Wayne It sure does look like the niagara pool in slow motion. Curious to find out if there is some sort of tide there, even if its miniscual If so, it should be fairly simple to locate where the fish are holding"
619999,mercman,2011-09-10 00:32:00,7054,  It has inflow and outflow. See......told ya..............River
620003,spincast,2011-09-10 00:35:00,3279,  Guess I'm a river after couple beers ?
620007,mercman,2011-09-10 00:39:00,7054,"  With beer though, the outflow is twice the inflow.IF i remember correctly"
620012,vinnimon,2011-09-10 01:01:00,2593,"  BRB MERC     Hang on    Almost there, yup, nope      Ok , AHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!     You are right, three bucks down the drain  TGIF"
