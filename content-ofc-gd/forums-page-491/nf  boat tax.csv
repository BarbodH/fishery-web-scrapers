Its not saying that i didn't pay tax witch i did pay. they want to know were i paid the tax, how much tax i paid, and how much i paid for the boat. How come they know that i bought a boat but don't know if i paid the tax. The best part is i cant find the bill of sale for the boat i know how much i paid for the package but not the price  for the motor, trailer, and boat seperatly. been to the bank to see if when i registared the trailer if i paid with debit card no luck must have used cash. Anyone know if i went to the NO service ontario if they keep the records of all transactions. oOh and i have had the boat for 2 years"
616167,pikehunter,2011-08-27 11:32:00,1659,"Most of the threads around here always said that you didn't need to pay tax on the boat portion of a transaction, just do the registration. The trailer part of a combination would have a tax payable upon registration. I am now confused too.  Sorry I am of no help."
616169,mike rousseau,2011-08-27 11:44:00,4661,I got 2 letters...  One for the boat I have now that I bought 2 years ago...  One for the boat I bought 7-8 years ago and sold 2 years ago...  If they want the taxes... They should make you pay taxes when you register your boat... Like a car with plates
616175,vinnimon,2011-08-27 12:27:00,2593,"I received the same letter as well. What burns me is when it was registered at service canada, they took copies of the invoice. So why the letter now? Taxes have been payed on the trailer at the mto office. The boat was free( ididnt want it to begin with). I had the boat with me for their viewing pleasure anyway, my last statement to them was, Do you want it? If so take it, its for free I was serious. She chuckled for a bit. Then back to business. So, the way I see it is, the government accepted the fact in hand and didnt ask for a dime. Acceptance, acknowledgement on their part, have a nice day ottawa. Guess what, 0 times 7 or 8% equals 0. Enough is enough, they keep digging deeper and deeper into our pockets for what?  On top of that, I received a letter asking to confirm that I have insurance on a newly purchased vehicle and as well as one that I sold recentlyOK, ask my insurance agent for it, Im on billable hrs right now Emotionicons only have 4 fingers for a reason."
616190,hirk,2011-08-27 13:15:00,571,"How about this one.I buy a boat in the US,payed 13% on the full value of boat,motor,trailer so no tax outstanding right? wrong!! I go too register the trailer and am told I owe 8% provincal tax (clerk says I should not have paid trailer pst at the border) Ok so she makes a phone call to head office to process my plate as I had no title for it and proceeds to tell me I owe 8% on the whole package as that how the province insures they get the tax now by hitting you when you get trailer plate? I say not happening,here is my receipt and you are MTO not Revenue office,this has NOTHING to do with my boat,engine.Amazingly she agreed and instead of paying like $270 she just charged me 8% on my trailer (would not issue plate otherwise).Now I have to chase revenue canada for $80 that I have paid twice."
616192,HTHM,2011-08-27 13:21:00,4082,"That is why, when importing, one needs to have seperate bills of sale for all three components."
616203,archer379,2011-08-27 13:50:00,277,the thing is i paid tax on the trailer and boat when i went into to register the trailer and get plates i know this because i had to argue with them because they wanted to tax me on the out board motor. Motors have no registration so i had the bill to say i paid X number for each pice the most beening the motor
616205,Cudz,2011-08-27 14:05:00,2652,"I bought a boat 2 years ago in July 2009 and got a letter 2 weeks ago saying I need to pay the tax on the boat.  I found my receipt photocopied it and send the 8% tax via personal cheque to the government. Weird that it was so late.  When you register the boat, that is when they should make you pay the tax just like with the trailer.  It is a messed up system!"
616219,lew,2011-08-27 14:54:00,12766,"I bought a new boat, motor & trailer in '99 and payed cash for everything in full including all taxes.  Couple years later I got a letter from the government asking for proof I payed the taxes so I sent a copy of the bill of sale.  Couple years later I get another letter asking for proof of taxes being payed so once again I sent a copy of the bill of sale.  Sure enough, a couple years go by and I get yet another letter asking for proof of taxes payed.  I ignored that one and have never heard back from them, but I still have the bill of sale even though I no longer own that boat.  It's tough dealing with in-competance."
616220,landry,2011-08-27 15:01:00,1005,"I went through the same thing. Imported boat and paid at border then they tried to get PST from me AGAIN, 2 years later - what a joke!!!"
616245,hirk,2011-08-27 17:49:00,571,I had seperate bills it's not the 1st boat of have imported
616297,HTHM,2011-08-28 00:04:00,4082,"That was for everyone elses benefit, remember who told me what to do when I imported the Ranger??? A clue, you will see him every morning in the mirror."
616322,danc,2011-08-28 01:43:00,4677,Boat registration is federal. Taxes are provincial. Thus the confusion.
616600,hirk,2011-08-29 02:29:00,571,Lol Albert. I had read your post but didnt catch who the poster was.
620116,whitbyboatguy,2011-09-10 17:24:00,130,"I got a letter as well. 4 years after I bought the boat and paid the PST and GST to the Feds. I called, told them that I paid the tax when imported it and was required to show that the taxes were paid when the boat was registered at Services Canada. I added that it is unreasonable for them to ask for tax receipts so many years after the purchase and that they need to communicate with their tax collectors at Federal Government for more information. The response was quick, OK we will take your name off of the list.  jerks"
620176,Skipper D,2011-09-10 22:35:00,1970," Itoo  bought a boat and received the same letter , stupid stuff , i told them they had mix me up with some one eles because we live to far inland to own boats ...."
620288,lookinforwalleye,2011-09-11 15:20:00,4399,I move every two years to stay ahead of the tax man!
