620241,adolson,2011-09-11 05:21:00,783,"Day starts off with a 9am-ish wake up call from a fellow OFC member. You may know him as Rod Caster, but to me, he's Rod Master. We'll get to that in a sec. We make plans to meet at Lowell Lake Rd and hit up #25 for brookies.  We get there, and head in. We troll around a while and nothing. Did a bit of casting, and nothing. I think we maybe gave up a tad early, but then, I'm the guy who spent almost 12 hours going in circles at Liberty chasing ghosts.. I was antsy to land something - it'd been a week since my last catch, after all, so I was fine with moving on. Trout can wait for another day. So we landed and had a bit of lunch, picked a random lake on the map and away we went.    We got in and trolled around a bit and did a bit of casting. That was mostly unproductive. Chad got a couple tiny perch on hook and worm at one point, and I was definitely feeling the nibbling, but nothing big was around. I thought we were about to pack it in, when finally we got into a few smallmouth near some downed trees near the shore. It was a long day, so my memory is a bit foggy. I think I caught the first one, and it was on a Hula Popper. But he caught more than me, and a real nice one in there, too.          At this point, I was pretty happy. We had caught fish, we had great weather, calm water. Beautiful day overall. Time to go home...    ...yeah right. The sun hasn't even set, it's just about to get good.  ""I wanna try off that point over there,"" he says. And so we motor over to it, and that's where we stayed the rest of the night. What followed can only be described as a massacre.        My camera's autofocus messed this one up a bit, but there are some chunks taken out of this guy, probably from a pike:  Finally a pic of me (all these pics are from my camera. Chad will add the pics he took, which I hope I am in at least a couple!)   At one point, we were pulling up so many walleye, I just gave up trying to get pics of them all. I didn't even have time to put a fish on the stringer if it was one we decided to keep, or put away the camera before he was pulling in another one. The best single day of fishing I've ever experienced. I don't know how many fish we boated.. Well over 30, probably over 40 if you include the bass. I don't think any were over 16"" but there were sure a lot of them. I took home my limit, ate two of the smaller ones (they were delicious) and will have the others soon,  Thanks Rod Master, for the invite and knowing your stuff when it comes to walleye. And your CD is now permanently linked in my mind to this trip (I've played it at least a dozen times). The day was pretty epic, especially for a lake neither of us had fished before.   Brookies, I'm coming, but you lucked out today."
620242,Roy,2011-09-11 05:47:00,13728,Congrats to you both. A great day of fishing there for sure.
620243,MichaelAngelo,2011-09-11 05:54:00,65," So epic, huge cudos!!  What area are you guys in?  Random lakes around GTA seem to be mostly Private Property XD... except for 1..."
620246,adolson,2011-09-11 06:21:00,783," He's from North Bay, I'm from the Tri-Towns. We met somewhere in the middle, Temagami or so."
620267,Pikeslayer8,2011-09-11 13:45:00,336,"Yeah, nice eyes and fish kissing.  You guys kill me.  Looks like a really fun day. :clapping:"
620272,Rod Caster,2011-09-11 14:28:00,5784,"Your camera takes GREAT photos wow! Mine is good because it's waterproof but the quality is no match.  I agree that we may have left the brookie lake a little early however on a sunny day like yesterday we could have trolled for HOURS in the daylight before they started bitting... IF they started biting. Those stocked lakes are a gamble; O2 deficiency, disease, over fishing are all things that can render the lake basically void of life. We covered the water as good as we could so for me it was time to move on. I had two other brookie lakes mapped out for us but again they were a gamble (and off-road journey) and I wanted to put you onto some fish.... or maybe we both need some brookie-fishinglessons haha.  The walleye fishing was FURIOUS folks! At one point it was a fish every cast. I haven't seen walleye fishing of that quality since my northern Alberta days. We now have a honey hole Dana... we should have weekly business meetings there.  I was under-the-gun at around 6pm when all we had caught were a few bass; all that was forgotten when Dana pulled in the first keeper. What a beauty!  Here are the pics:   Trolling the brookie lake   Hula Popper bass    Walleye shots              It was a great day Dana...thanks for the company."
620279,Leecher,2011-09-11 14:51:00,7832,"Great report, fish and pics Dana Sometimes a change of plans is all it takes Thanks for sharing Jacques"
620286,Nipfisher,2011-09-11 15:08:00,2449,Remember there are a select few that you can share your honey hole with. Good fishing boys. What is the name of your new musical duo?
