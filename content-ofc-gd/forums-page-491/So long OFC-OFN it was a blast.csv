620581,PainInTheBass,2011-09-12 13:27:00,102,"An incredibly difficult decision, no doubt.  However; I believe that it is the right decision for you.  You have obviously mulled it over quite a bit before reaching this conclusion.  However, it is one based on the knowledge of your own personal weaknesses, and the clarity to understand what matters most.  I applaud you, sir."
618800,muskymatt,2011-09-06 02:39:00,2608,"  Gotta agree, I fish, my kids fish and my wife fishes, and they all have fun doing it. Fishing is a healthy sport, you get outside, fresh air and appreciate nice scenery. Good things happen like family bonding, appreciation for nature and the outdoors, responsibilty and more, too many benifits to list.  It's a lifestyle, let it become part of what your children and family are about and you grow and benifit all along the way.  oh and the key ingredient....moderation!"
618804,Grimace,2011-09-06 02:55:00,2020,"I fish, my wife doesn't.  We have a kid, there are no quarrels.  I know instinctively where the line is.   I do not cross it.  If you are having troubles trying to figure out what is acceptable and what us going overboard is then you should make a schedule ( I fish once a month ) type of thing.   If you inherently know  where the line is and cross it repeatedly then the problem is not fishing."
618814,Cudz,2011-09-06 03:36:00,2652,"My friend, I spend more time than you can imagine with my children.  Because of my job I am able to have that opportunity.  THis is not the issue.  WHen I do go fishing I do so mainly when they are asleep.  I actually don't fish that much (at the most twice a week, but usually only once a week for about 4 hours).  Probably less than lots of people here.  The problem is that my demeanor.  I don't fish that much but really want to. It might not make sense to you but if it is not an option anymore I won't be angry that I can't be doing it.  Basically if it doesn't exist I won't crave it.  It is difficult to explain but if the temptation is constantly there it will be all I think about, therefore I remove it.  I know for most it does not make sense but unfortunately this is how I work.  When I am interested in something I don't do it at 50%.  At this point in my life I need to be with my kids and wife.  To each their own but for me this is how it is going to be.  Hopefully the fish will still be there when I get back.  I guess I had better erase a bunch of waypoint on the gps before I sell it. lol"
618818,highdrifter,2011-09-06 05:01:00,2534,That's gotta be tough..  I was almost married once..  Couldn't go through with it.  Just couldn't give up my time on the water..  Big ups though dude for choosing what's important; being there for your kids.  I respect that very much.  All the best.  Come back soon!!
618826,singingdog,2011-09-06 09:49:00,1047,"Tough decision, but sounds like you have given it lots of thought. Blessings to you and your family. Thanks for being one of the good guys."
618827,Handlebarz,2011-09-06 10:28:00,3790,Good luck with the family I hope things are better for ya I always enjoyed the posts from you just remember we will be here in 5 years consider this your FA meeting place.  Maybe the mods can make a separate section just for non fishing posts so guys who are addicted to the board can still enjoy it with no fishing content  For the guys and girls who have a love of your life that does not enjoy your obsession to fishing let this be a lesson that you will also need to make this choice down the road as it will never work out if they don't enjoy the time on the water with you or in my case the time your gone away. If you have kids or are planning to have kids get them out fishing and camping at the earliest age as they will be brain washed into LOVING fishing and camping this will save you from meeting this same fate.
618832,Whitespinnerbait,2011-09-06 11:12:00,2038,  There already is a Non Fishing Section on OFC........Its in the Fishing Forum
618838,bubbles,2011-09-06 11:54:00,591,"  I hear ya, I have a good friend who has the same personality.  100%, there is nothing in between, it's hard to understand for people who do not live with it.  Good luck, there will be lots of fish left for you when you get a chance to return."
618849,TJQ,2011-09-06 12:37:00,7806,"A mans gotta do what a mans gotta do. Ive let go of couple things that were interfering with a better life this summer as well. It aint easy, but if its bad enough to see you'll be better off.. well, thats the way the tree falls."
618865,crappieperchhunter,2011-09-06 13:23:00,2582,"Cudz, totally understand and respect your decision. Fishing is a passion that my young family and wife never shared. I pretty much gave it up for 10-12 years.  Once the kids started to hang with friends and not require constant adult supervision/attention I started to get back into it again.  Just got back from the cottage and fished for 3 hours yesterday with my son. Thats twice this summer and I can honestly say we never fished twice in a summer together before. He is 22 now and on his own so it's more about one on one father and son time then fishing...but we both enjoy it.  My wife was in the boat 3 times this summer as well. That has never happened before either. I guess I'm just trying to say that if you take care of your family then they will eventually understand your passion for fishing and want to share time on the water with you because they want to be with you. If they actually end up sharing your passion that's just a bonus.  I could not be happier with how it has worked out for me. I wish you the same outcome."
618873,johnnyb,2011-09-06 13:41:00,3413,"Wow, that's pretty heavy.  I understand the frustration of feeling like you don't get enough time out there, but, luckily, I can usually temper that and be happy with the time I do get out.  Good on you for knowing what you have to do, and being a man about it.  I still don't know about selling all your stuff....but....if that's what it takes, then that's what it takes.  It comes through in many of your posts that you love your family, and the extra time and attention you're giving them now will most definitely pay off.  All the best, Cudz. "
618875,whitbyboatguy,2011-09-06 13:48:00,130,"Cudz, I think I understand. Family is part of it but that is not the conflict. Fishing is not a bad thing but it is for you, some people may not understand that. Keep listening to yourself, wife and close non-fishing fiend friends. Other people have problems with other things:  Internet Food Alcohol OCD Exercise Watching sports (I think this is the closest one to you)  You are self aware and recognize the issue, hopefully one day it gets figured out.....aging and loss of testosterone etc....I am no psychologist. If it doesn't there are still enough things in the world to fill 10+ lifetimes with activities. Good luck!"
618880,wallyboss,2011-09-06 14:07:00,1095,Cudz nobody else but you can make that decision.  Between you and me  FAMILY is quite a good Addiction.
618883,bigbuck,2011-09-06 14:15:00,2449,"Good luck to you!!! You gotta do what you gotta do. Family is always first. My girls aged 6 and 5 love to come out on the boat with daddy to fish. I don't drop a line when they are fishing. I let them have fun and in turn, I have a blast. One day, you'll have the time to do what you want to."

619350,motion,2011-09-07 22:43:00,403,"Hey Chris, hang in there. I gave up fishing for over 10 year after I was first married to spend more time with my family. They are only young once and that was my priority at that time. Funny thing happened though, my son loves fishing now more that I did at his age and my  oldest daughters still love to pick up a rod when we are up at our cottage.  Take care of your family. You are yonge and have may years of fishing ahead of you if you choose to ""come back"".  Cheers."
620068,PaulyPops,2011-09-10 11:18:00,1,"I'm new here so I'll call this my virgin psot.. but I have to say something here.  First off its brave of you to admit such a thing. I was addicted to gambling in my 30s and had a real problem with that. I did what you are attempting and quit cold turkey. whenever I was around my wife and kids I would get annyed and want to get back to the card games.  Addicting is the problem not fishing.  There are plenty of support groups for this too which I highly recommend.  Dont sell your boat if the family likes boating, but if its going to be a problem for you in the meantime its probably a good idea.  Once you are away from fishing for a season you can focus on the addiction.   If you have a handle on it (find your not obsessed with it) you can go back to putting the time limits on yourself! You know fish with a buddy who you know wont keep you out and also understands your problem.  In the meantime you are doing the right thing remember fix your addiction first then reward yourself with the fishing later.  Good luck man! Paul"

I'm in that stage of life trying to balance my Recreational love for Fishing, a demanding career, and family Life(married with 3 young children.)  Its not easy, and the minute one is out of balance the others suffer...its a fine line"
620340,lplp,2011-09-11 19:55:00,83,"I agree with you to a certain point, giving up fishing ,I dont think you should, do you have other hobbies that you can occupy yourself at home. You will resent your family ,yes get rid of the boat , as the kids get older they will start to like fishing .You need to balance your family life and your own enjoyment ,if fishing was an escape for you ,and you enjoy it ,that is your decision , if you would like to go, . Trust me on this ,i have been going through quite a bit of turmoil at home for past year or so , you need to look after yourself and be happy ,this will in turn produce a good family life also,, If you think it is an addiction like ocd or something ,which could quite be ,see your dr. and ask him about it,, you can balance it if you recognize it for yourself ,you can only help yourself ,and noone should try to change someone else's likes ,(if bad yes but fishing ,sorry not).Just my two cents worth.. dont take the wrong way ,"
620375,Cudz,2011-09-11 22:17:00,2652,"Since making the decision I feel a weight has actually been lifted off my shoulder and I think I have been a kinder person since.  I still love fishing and I do think about it but so far so good.  I feel bad for some of my friends that I have introduced to fishing and who often depend on me to get excursions organized and do not have boats of their own.  I am encouraging them to keep fishing and that I will be back in a while to do it with them.  I still think fishing is a great passtime and hobby! I have got lots of hobbies to keep me busy.  I work out at the gym quite a bit and have been for the past 24 years or so.  I am also going to run a marathon this upcoming year for my 40th bday.  I will run more.  My runs in the morning are only 40 mins long and before the kids get up and I don't like running at all but do it to get ready for may next year. I also have an interest in cars and really enjoyed the time I spent with BillM out on the water talking cars.  I might get a car eventually and spend a bit of time in the garage.  We'll see (maybe I can convince my 68 year old dad to give me his vette).  I don't have ocd and for 8 years I did not fish too much only like once a month maybe and during that time I never had any other hobby that took up as much 'mindspace' as fishing did to me as of last week. I did however play many sports before getting married and was out with them for 5 night a week.  That was soon down to once a week after first child.  Anyway, I still feel good about my decision and I will miss it for sure but for now, removing the fishing option has made me a better dad, husband and probably person.  Thanks for all the PMs and I hope to see you guys on the water in a few years."

I'm a lucky guy to have a wife and 2 boys who totally love the out of doors. Both boys enjoy fishing, the youngest and bit more then the oldest, but my 19 yr old has a few priorities now as did we all at that age. My wife isn't much for actually fishing, but she will and has on several occasion just sat in the boat, in the ice hut, or on the side of a bank just to be outside.  Do what you need to do but make sure you never totally give up this great passion we all call fishing!  Colin"

618479,Rich,2011-09-05 01:19:00,3927,"Being addicted to fishing is like being addicted to food. It's very possible, it poses a comfort (via 'escape) that relieves stress like no other.  Much like someone 'addicted' to marijuanna. There is no physical addiction, but a craving for an ultimate feeling achieved through that experience one or more times in the past.  You do what you gotta do.. but without any hobby you'll suffer some major stress issues.  ""Cold turkey is not always the best option"" doesn't just apply to smoking cigarettes. lol  You say you have an 'addictive personality' .. I just hope that your cravings don't move to something different in an effort to achieve the feelings that fishing can give you. Cuz trust me - there ain't nothing else on earth that gives the same feeling or I'd be doing it right now! lol  Hope it all works out for you bud. Good luck."

618510,Nipfisher,2011-09-05 05:07:00,2449,"Chris, I find myself in the same boat as you. I have two boys 8 and 2 and a wife that doesn't enjoy fishing, or drinking. My problem is I really enjoy both! When we had Alex I took about 2 years off from serious fishing. Still fished a bit, but focused on the family. Then for about 4 years I got back into it. Got a boat, sled, ice hut, 4 wheeler, etc. Now we have our second son Karter, and  she feels I have not given the necessary time to my family. She is constantly on me about fishing and the time I spend on-line, or talking fishing. To solve the problem, I have learned to ask her for permission first before arranging fishing trips (Rod Caster will agree to this). If she is o.k. with it then I can go. If not, I stay home. She does not feel bad about saying no as I ask her and she answers. Simple. She is not being mean or unreasonable.  I have a responsibility to her and my boys that comes before fishing.  Now if I can figure out the social drinking piece, we'll be good.  Family First.....Fishing Seccond  All the best. Fish will still be there in 5 years."

You've obviously thought long and hard on this and have made this decision based on you and your family's best interest and for that, you should be congratulated. You've been a good contributing member to this community of ours and you surely will be missed out on the water. Remember though that whether you're fishing or not, you're still a part of this community and are welcome to keep us updated on what's happening in your life. Good luck to you, Chris.

In 5 years the fish will still be waiting for you, and the bonds you have formed may present an opportunity for your family to share your passion. I know when my two were smaller, fishin took a backseat - actually, it didnt even get in the agenda 90% of the tiime. It wasnt until we took a few vacations at cottages with docks and sunfish that the enjoyment spread to the kids. Bon chance!  "

618558,Rizzo,2011-09-05 13:42:00,4754,"Good for you Chris, hopefully some day you can achieve a balance. For me, also with a young family, it means I get the boat out approx once every two weeks and fish for around 6 hours. When I go, I leave home super early so that I will be home early afternoon and can spend the rest of that day with my wife and kids. Not as much as i like to fish, but like you, its not necessarily about what i want. People have to consider the others in their lives. I hope you stay on OFC, because for me this is how I scratch that fishing itch!"

618582,ehg,2011-09-05 15:16:00,2666,That sure is a cold turkey type approach. Hang on to your fishing stuff though as casting off a dock or other little opportunities will present themselves as you go places with your family.
618602,mercman,2011-09-05 17:23:00,7054,"Chris, I understand addictive behaviour more that most.What you are doing takes so much more inner strength than the average person can comprehend. To achieve the goal you have set for yourself, don't allow youreslf to be drawn into anything that may cause you to ""slip"" back into fishing. This includes shore fishing. Sell it ALL Chris. In 5 years you can start over and with the experience you have had, choose more wisely the equipment you purchase. I am a very lucky man to have a wife who likes to fish. It allows me to enjoy my passion.However, knowing my addictive self, i am constantly making sure that i maintain the equilibrium that i so need to maintain a healthy balance in my life.  Your kids need a father, and your wife needs a husband.Use you energy to be the best of both, that you can be. If things get tough, do not be too shy to reach out for help.Its is always there if you ask.  Paul"
618623,stuntman,2011-09-05 18:53:00,96,"Sounds very logical and difficult to argue with.  An addiction is an addiction but at least this one is only mental.  I had to do the same thing many years ago for different reasons.  A decade later I now have priorities, limits and rules that silenced the constant need but it sounds like your addiction is too powerful for that. Don't feel guilty about picking up a rod and bobber while sitting at a doc with some else.  Just make them the #1 priority, maybe not hold a rod and don't forget."
618624,whitbyboatguy,2011-09-05 18:58:00,130, that is right. Ditch the crack and keep that crack pipe handy for those little opportunities Keeping some barbie rods in the garage might be OK for now.

618408,Cudz,2011-09-04 18:07:00,2652,"It has come to my attention that I have an unhealthy addiction to fishing.  It is what I think about most of the time.  When I am not fishing I wish that I was.  When I am out fishing I dread the last cast and always want to stay longer.  When I can't go fishing I get angry.  When I can only go fishing for an hour or two I feel rushed and get angry.  Whenever I pass a new lake river or body of water I want to fish it.  Now for some members here this would seem normal, but to non-fisherpeople it is not.  So here is my dilema.  I have a family, a wife and 3 young daughters, of which non really enjoy fishing that much.  Everytime I am out fishing, I have to leave them with mom.  When I am out there I feel guilty for leaving them and think about them quite a bit.  I also get angry at my wife who puts limits on the amount I fish and when I have to be home (she is actually correct in most cases). hen I get home I am often short-fused because I want to be fishing more.  When I don't fish I have no patience for them because I often blame them for taking up some of my time that I could be fishing. Fishing and family is a delicate balance that I can not seem to master (or even come close to balancing).  Although I fish only twice a week I really need to spend more time with my wife and my 5, 8 and 10 year old kids.  For this reason I am selling my boat and giving up fishing totally for 5 years or so. I know it sounds extreme but this is what I have to do.  I have to remove those temptations.  At this point some of you might be laughing and I wish I were too but it truly is an addiction.  Last night I made a conscious decision to focus more on my family and to do this I have to stop fishing (not slow down). I am aware that I have an addictive personality and it is for this reason that I don't drink alcohol. I quit drinking at the age of 21 (actually before I could actually become a serious drinker)in order that I did not get addicted.  I don't know if that makes sense but I did not want to test my addictive personality. Anyway, I will miss fishing.  I will miss all the members here. I am thankful for the members I have met and fished with and wish that I could have have fished with all of you. I learned loads here and hopefully helped a few members out as well. Take care guys and gals.  You are a special community. Tight Lines  Chris"

618413,lew,2011-09-04 18:43:00,12766,"You'll be missed around here Cudz, you always contributed alot to this place.  Best of luck doing what you figure you've gotta do."
618414,ccmtcanada,2011-09-04 18:48:00,7971,"Wow Cudz.  I can tell this has been something you have been thinking about for a while.  It's well thought out and I sincerely hope it all works out for you.  I have enjoyed your reports and input here, and along with many others here, I will miss them.  Good luck with everything...the internet will still be around 5 years from now and I hope to ""meet up with you"" again here.  All the best, Cliff"
618415,Joey,2011-09-04 18:51:00,9122,"This saddens me to see, but you know yourself better than us.  Good luck and I hope it all works out for you bud!!  Joey"
618416,misfish,2011-09-04 18:51:00,29133,"I always fished and golfed,played hockey when we had our boys.

618417,mike rousseau,2011-09-04 18:53:00,4661,Ggod for you taking control of tge situation...   And we will be waiting here for you when you fall off the wagon and need info on a lake 5 hours away...  Man ... Fishing is a disease...
618422,asdve23rveavwa,2011-09-04 19:27:00,2690,"Good luck, don't think I could ever give up my fishing addiction!!!  I, however, am lucky that the rest of the family enjoys the sport."
618423,Jigger,2011-09-04 19:28:00,1237,Cant say i saw that coming! Thanks for the good times! Youll be welcome on my boat when the relapse comes. Take care.
618424,splashhopper,2011-09-04 19:52:00,2931,"Very well written Cudz....I understand the MENTAL OBSESSION to fishing. I too have an ""addictive personality"".... but find fishing to be THE THING that keeps my own mind from ever wandering back to the bottle that I crawled out of 20 years ago.  An old friend of mine once said to me when I was about to make a life changing decision:  "" If it is a good idea Today, it will still be a good idea Tomorrow""  No matter what though, those kids come waaay ahead of fishing."

618426,Dusky,2011-09-04 20:05:00,310,Good for you. Family comes way before anything else. Good luck with your decision.
618427,Leecher,2011-09-04 20:08:00,7832,Very sad to hear Chris but fully support your decision.... Family is number one and fishing should not interfere in any way.... Wish you the best of luck!!! Jacques
618428,adolson,2011-09-04 20:33:00,783,"That is very respectable, man. I know it might seem selfish to some people, but my wife and I never planned to have kids partially because everyone we know who has kids never seems to have time to do anything. I'm lucky to have an understanding wife, but I could see that changing if we ever had kids. I wouldn't want to stick her at home with them all the time, and I too would feel guilty. I already feel guilty when I go out and she stays home, but she comes often enough with me and doesn't mind because she has other hobbies of her own to do. But if it came down to it, I hope I'd have the ability to make the same decision you did. Removing temptations is hard, and it's often the only way to succeed in many areas of life, not just fishing. I can't see anyone laughing at you over this - that'd be petty and stupid. It's honorable, and your family will probably see your sacrifice and respect you and love you for it. Have a happy life, man."
618430,Big Cliff,2011-09-04 20:59:00,6899,"You can always fish another day but time not spent with family can never be replaced! I had a similar situation when my family was younger and didn't hunt or fish for almost 10 years. Once my family was grown to the point where they had their own intrests; girl friends/boy friends, a wife with hobbies of her own, I was able to get back into it and enjoy it even more.  I really do hope that you will still stay in touch around here, this board is a lot more than just fishing, we are a family and you have been an important part of it. Do what you have to do but please don't forget us, I know many on this board won't forget you!"
618431,Tarzan's Jane,2011-09-04 21:00:00,1183,I think the toughest call would be the one where you disregard the needs of your family only to wake one day with the knowledge that some other man has taken over.  Take care and protect that which you hold the most dear to your heart.  5 years is nothing  - time really does fly.  Enjoy your girls - enjoy your wife.  All the best.
618433,uglyfish,2011-09-04 21:01:00,981,"Sad to see ya go, always loved the reports from simcoe and the big brown bass there!! But I know how u feel, I fish and play hockey, baseball and golf and it cuts into the family time, to the point my fiance also gets mad and for that I have had to cut down the amout of fishing I do, pretty much limited to tournies, and hockey is out as well.  Ill be lookin for ya in a few years to be back.  When will u be selling the boat? I'm hoping to get one, the lady got her engagement ring, and she said once she gets that, I'm allowed to get a boat! Lol"
618440,Whitespinnerbait,2011-09-04 21:59:00,2038,  Completely cut out the Hockey....Baseball.....and Golf . Spend more time with the Family and the Fishing will only improve.
618456,fishinguypat,2011-09-04 23:34:00,547,"Why don't you try something your kids like and get into that,then you could be with the family more.then when you get back into fishing one day it will be worth the wait"
618462,Cudz,2011-09-05 00:02:00,2652,Hey Thanks for all the positive responses.  We'll see you guys in a while.  Thanks for the PMs too!! take care Chris
618472,MCTFisher9120,2011-09-05 00:53:00,3761,This is a sad day...we shall have a moment of silence in remembrance of Cudz. Family is important man but no matter how much I get yelled at I'm still goin fishin haha. I'll see how it is years down the road when I have my own family.  I got a funny feeling well see a ice fishing report from ya this winter
618475,irishfield,2011-09-05 00:58:00,26272,Enjoy the wimmin Chris ! There are more important things in life than fishing! Good to see you realize that.
