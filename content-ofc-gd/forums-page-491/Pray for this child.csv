619922,Terry,2011-09-09 19:48:00,14456,"ok I googled to find out what you were talking about..  lets hope it turns out ok   SPARWOOD, B.C. — The RCMP are asking for help from business owners and people with summer homes near where a three-year-old boy disappeared in southeastern British Columbia.  After more than two days, there is still no sign of young Kienan Hebert, whose disappearance from his home in Sparwood has prompted an Amber Alert.  There is also no confirmed sightings of Randall Hopley, who has been named as a suspect, or his vehicle.  Cpl. Dan Moskaluk says police are asking anyone who owns a part-time recreational home in the area to visit their properties and look for any signs of a break-in or theft.  Moskaluk also says business owners in the region should look over any surveillance video to determine whether Kienan or Hopley were spotted.  At the same time, ground searchers are still combing the area around Kienan’s home, saying if he is on his own, he still has a good chance of survival.   "

619928,johnnyb,2011-09-09 19:59:00,3413,Apparently the suspect's mother (grandmother?) has gone on tv pleading with him to turn himself in.  I haven't followed enough of the story to understand why this guy is a suspect....but I really hope that kid gets found safe and sound.
620325,tightline,2011-09-11 18:41:00,322,the boy was returned home last night...the police received a call at 3am telling them to check the families home and he was there.  http://news.ca.msn.com/canada/abducted-bc-boy-returned-home
