618990,misfish,2011-09-06 19:16:00,29133,"You can hit Fairy lake in Acton.Bass and whiskers,from when I can remember."
619004,fish_finder,2011-09-06 19:44:00,370,"The speed river here in guelph has carp, bass and pike.  PM me if you want some spots to hit"
619012,mercman,2011-09-06 20:00:00,7054," Mike......put your rod down, and enjoy the wedding.Remember what happens to people who fish too much ?"
619018,Musky or Specks,2011-09-06 20:16:00,2710,No musky but let me know what you want to target and I'll PM you.
619039,canada414,2011-09-06 21:41:00,40,Guelph lake is supposed to have some decent pike fishing but I haven't fished it yet
619048,tightline,2011-09-06 22:00:00,322,Big Large Mouth in Guelph lake and more hammer handles then you can throw a rapala at...the speed and eromasa rivers both run through our little town and both hold bass and pike.  I'm home all weekend give a shout I'll put you on some spots!!
619052,vinnimon,2011-09-06 22:08:00,2593,"  Yup, all bottled up in arberfolye, at 101 brock rd guelph.  Mike, pm me and I can send you to a nice hidding spot for fishing, and some nice scenery as well. Guelph lake is ok, it was much better years ago, fishing wise for me."
619154,Darrel,2011-09-07 02:34:00,82," There is Rockwood Campgrounds 15 minutes east of Guelph. I camped with my wife 4 x's this summer. Beautiful place!!! Fishing isn't bad for smallies at the top of the(Eramosa) river, which the campground surrounds. They use to stock it with trout as well, but I have yet to catch one there. Here's a link below. Check it out!!!  http://www.grandrive...ks/rockwood.cfm"
619210,torco,2011-09-07 13:37:00,656,I am actually taking my brother out sunday morning to show him some spots around town but my guess is you'll probably be tired or hung-over to be up and out early on the sunday morning. Anyways you can pm as well if you need some help. Where's the wedding at?
619229,eman,2011-09-07 15:27:00,101, lots of shore fishing - check  big carp - check  pike (big and small) - check  bass (smallies & largies) - check  perch - check  I fish there once or twice a year because its close to my folks place. Not a #s lake but you can catch the odd big bass or pike. Try to find some healthy weeds. Never caught a carp but seen lots of them. Theres always jumping and getting me to throw my lures hping its a bass feeding on surface.

620685,torco,2011-09-12 17:57:00,656,"Nice venue, well did you get any fishing in?"
620710,mike rousseau,2011-09-12 18:49:00,4661,I didn't end up bringing my tackle... I decided 1 weekend without fishing would make the misses happy...  But I did hit up some local tackle shops for some new toys...
