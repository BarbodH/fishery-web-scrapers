620265,bh87ss,2011-09-11 13:30:00,33,"Whats your preferred method and with that said whats your preferred set up.  Do you use a stiff heavy long rod and set the clicker on your line counter back so any hit trickers from the reel?  Do you use a softer tip rod for dipseys, set the drag tighter and rely on watching the rod for a strike indication?  Is it a combination of both above and if so what is the preferred rod for 0 or #1 dispseys. Using the Accudepths 17 and 27's at this time.  thanks"

620566,bucktail,2011-09-12 13:00:00,1857,I usally have 2 dipseys out the sides spooled with 30 pound braid and then a flouro from the dipsey to the worm harmess. Set up as Uncle Buck says with the clicker. 2 downriggers with light action I run 5 feet of bottom with anything you fancey.  This is a mid to late season setup as early on your better of with Uncle Bucs set up with boards as the fish are shallower or higher depending where you are fishing.  Riggers only come out when the fish drop below 40 feet and # 16 elastic band as a release so you see the sublte hits..
