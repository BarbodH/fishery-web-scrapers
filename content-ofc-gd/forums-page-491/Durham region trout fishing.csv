620290,danjang,2011-09-11 15:34:00,148,"Assuming that you are targeting migrating trout, you can use flies, spinners,worms and salmon roe bags. The only problem is that you will encounter crowds of salmon fisherpeople as the trout are usually found in the lower stretches of the rivers right now. Any of the salmon rivers should hold browns and maybe even a few bows."
620295,Locnar,2011-09-11 16:10:00,645,"Hmm, is there any better time for hittin' up the rivers?"
620304,timmeh,2011-09-11 17:10:00,609," If the fish are in, people will follow. If you're willing to put the time and effort into locating some lesser fisher waters you may be able to find some peace and quiet, but don't expect anyone to offer up those spots on the internet. For the most part if you want to fish for steelies you're going to have to learn to share the water. If you wait until the temps really start to drop or fish in bad weather there will be fewer people around but it can still be busy.  However sharing the water can offer some benefits for someone trying to learn. Pay attention to the guys who are catching fish, watch what they're using and how they're fishing. Ask a few questions and you may get some good hints to help you get started."
