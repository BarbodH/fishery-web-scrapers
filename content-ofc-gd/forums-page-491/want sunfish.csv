620084,whitbyboatguy,2011-09-10 13:00:00,130,"Need spot to take kids today, but have requirements so it is not a super easy find for my area:  -clear water. Looking down at the bobber would be good like they do at ceserea -sunfish, sunfish sunfish, rockbass. enough to keep a kid happy, board kids are no fun. -not strictly fishing. Throwing stones or play at park or quiet spot. So the concrete dock at Ceserea would be a no go. -not in the way of others. So again a boat launch where we have to keep an eye on the kids every cast won't work. being around other kids is good. -30-40 minute drive seems OK. but I have been told that Peterborough is too far.   any good leads?"
620085,Jer,2011-09-10 13:05:00,1426,"Well, Peterborough is less than 30 minutes for me...kinda depends where you're starting from."
620086,GBW,2011-09-10 13:06:00,8460,scugog right beside the Port Perry boat launch.  if you walk North of the ramp on the path there are a bunch of spots you and the kids can fish.  sunfish and perch are all over the place there.  dinks but something for the kids (and you) to enjoy.
620087,GBW,2011-09-10 13:07:00,8460,I'm guessing he's from the Whitby area based on his name...
620101,whitbyboatguy,2011-09-10 15:20:00,130,Thanks for the replies. The wife snarled and threw the day out of the window so I will be doing my #2 choice of cleaning the garage and arranging fishing stuff. the kids will be doing something else.  I will check out that scugog spot for future reference. thanks.
620156,johnnyb,2011-09-10 21:14:00,3413,keep your head up....do your chores....soon you'll be on the water instead of online    like me  
620198,smally21,2011-09-11 00:41:00,993,quite the splash pad port perry has on the waterfront...
620203,whitbyboatguy,2011-09-11 01:17:00,130," Yes...I have seen it, thanks for the reminder. We have 2 of those in Whitby and I think more are going up elsewhere. Let me tell you, when I was a kid....."
