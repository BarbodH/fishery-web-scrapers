620035,Grimace,2011-09-10 02:16:00,2020,"A fish doesn't give a crap if you have confidence in your lure or not.  In certain situations, lures either work or they don't.  Silly mind games with yourself are just that."

620047,Grimace,2011-09-10 02:55:00,2020,    There is only one reason that I would ever laugh at that - I would have one upped you by jigging a big ole octupus!!
620054,ctranter,2011-09-10 03:37:00,543,"I try to look at my tackle box and apply the same indiscriminate values that I apply to my job as a teacher.  Sometimes I randomly use lures that I have little confidence in to allow for the opportunity to be surprised.  Don't get me wrong, I still use species-specific baits... but I feel that I too often force myself into the same typical model of thinking, that isn't always best.  I usually bust out my consistent baits first, but if they fail I won't hesitate to try something new, or something unexpected.  If we never experimented, we would never find new baits."
620076,mike rousseau,2011-09-10 11:50:00,4661,I don't understand why anybody would buy a lure they have no confidence in...  When I buy lures... I'm 95% sure I can catch fish on em... Maybe not pound... But catch something...
620081,lew,2011-09-10 12:33:00,12766,"I used to fish muskies with a couple buds who used Sledges alot and liked them so I went out and bought a couple. I fished them for a season but just never really took a liking to them, didn't have much confidence in them, and gave them away.  A couple years later I was fishing with someone else on the Ottawa River and watched him get a 30 pounder on a white Sledge so figured it was time to give them another try.  The white Sledge has now become one of my top 3 lures and gets me alot of nice fish every year.  Funny how things turn around"
620091,mike rousseau,2011-09-10 13:26:00,4661,Well i guess black perch did that this year...  Everyone told me it worked... So I bought lures I liked in that color and got musky on em...  But I was pretty confident they would work... I trust the people that give me info...
620244,MichaelAngelo,2011-09-11 05:58:00,65," OMGOSH I saw this post and I must reply!  Recent story:  Fishing off the dock at my friend's cottage, no luck with mepps, rapala shads, spoons, etc.  Got frustrated so I took out this old random lure I didn't even know how to work in the water and... BAM smallmouth as soon as it hit the water.  Anyway.... *pats myself on the back* good story"
620245,adolson,2011-09-11 06:19:00,783,"I don't have much confidence in my spinners. I only caught what's in my avatar on one of them, and other that that, nothing. I know they work. I've seen a big pike caught on a Mepps #3!  The other no-confidence lures for me are the Moto Minnow (uh...) and the version of the Jitterbug that I own (hooks on back). The former, well, it's a freaking wind-up toy. The latter, I have had a few strikes, but I dunno, there are just two hooks at the back, and so the fish have to hit it a certain way to even have a chance at setting the hook. I only had one on once, and I thought I had set the hook, and suddenly I had confidence in it. Maybe I did it too hard, or maybe it didn't have the hooks in its mouth at all - I don't know, but it got off after 15-20 seconds or so, and away went my confidence. I like the lure, just not the hooks. I want the other version with the Hula Popper-like double hanging trebles."
619592,manjo39,2011-09-08 18:52:00,354,Anyone ever catch a fish with a lure that you had no confidence in?
619598,Roy,2011-09-08 19:07:00,13728,The problem is that a lure I have no confidence in will rarely be at the end of my line.

619603,aplumma,2011-09-08 19:13:00,6896,A lures got to start somewhere either you heard it was a good lure or you caught fish with it so their has to be some kind of confidence to tie it. I usually find I will tie on a rubber bait in an unknown color to see if it is the color of the day though.   Art

619608,manitoubass2,2011-09-08 19:20:00,11391,"I tinker with baits all the time and sometimes try really odd presentations. Sometimes they look good or sound good in theory, other times not so much.  Turns out that some really ""ugly"" presentations work at times, and before catching fish on them, I would say I had little confidence in them working.  But when something pays off, thats the fun part.  A pretty good example of this would be a slow death rig for walleye. The baits spinning and looks completely unnatural (when using minnows), but man, sometimes it works so darn well"
619609,NAW,2011-09-08 19:22:00,4022," Well, I don't want them to loose my confidence lures"
619620,GoneFishin,2011-09-08 20:00:00,349,"   I was fishing for pike once and we couldn't get into a thing. So I got bored and started trying on just about every lure in my box. I tied on a suick that I got as part of a trade and threw it in the water. I reeled it in not knowing how to use it and thought this is a stupid lure lol. Figured one more cast, this time I'd try to give it jerks and see what happens. Threw it out jerked it twice then bam! A pike came up and smoked it.. The last thing I was expecting was to get a hit on it but it ended up being the only lure that produced for us that day. Other then that I can't really think of a time I got a fish on a lure I didn't have confidence in."

619630,Rod Caster,2011-09-08 20:42:00,5784,"When the fish are really hungry, I'll use my non-confidence lures and learn new techniques. For me its deeper diving crankbait, but I'm working on it."
619632,johnnyb,2011-09-08 20:55:00,3413,"They are usually a last resort for me....and to be honest, I probably don't give them enough time in the water to really test them out.  Handing them to someone who is neutral, or who thinks they'll work, is often a good way to get a bit of a boost.  Once you see someone catch on them....it's easier to use them.  Hmmm....maybe we should have a non-confidence swap...dig out the lures we don't use and trade'em...."

619646,canada414,2011-09-08 21:48:00,40, I definately Agree. I've lent friends non confindence lures and had them catch fish off them too.
619647,canada414,2011-09-08 21:51:00,40,I'll often also start a day casting non confidence baits so I dont end up not catching anything on a confidence bait. Just wondering ive bought a few Japanese cranks and I'm not sure if they give me more confidence in casting a better quality bait of mrake me more afraid to cast it into fish holding structure. How about anyone else?

619893,manitoubass2,2011-09-09 16:45:00,11391,"This spring, I decided to take a really cheap crank bait, strip the paint off it, and tinker with the coloring. I used some neon glow in the dark paint from walmart (cost a buck), painted the lure, then added some horrendous eyes and covered it in shiny nail polish, then clear coat. It was so horrible looking words can't really describe it.  I went and tried it out, and caught bass after bass for an entire weekend. It outpeformed many of my fav. lures, like DT series cranks from Rapala, X-raps, flat raps etc.  I had zero confidence in that lure before using it. Now it's been repainted and replaced the hooks 2-3 times, and its still catchin fish. Many times it's now the first outta the box when I'm cranking for shallow bass.    Yuck!"
619895,Roy,2011-09-09 16:51:00,13728,There are no hooks! Did the fish choke on it?
619897,manitoubass2,2011-09-09 16:56:00,11391,"   haha, not at thank point there was no hooks, it was still drying.     Spring smallie after choking on a hookless bait!"
