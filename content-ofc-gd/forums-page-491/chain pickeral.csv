620041,vinnimon,2011-09-10 02:25:00,2593,"  I havent read any of the replies yet, but I did ask about the same thing not too long ago, We did catch them on a regular basis on an erie trib way back when. They were common and small, very tasty as well. I still pitch a line to this day in a particular hole to catch one, once again. With no luck at all since then But there were other picks to be had in lieu of it"

620247,Billy Bob,2011-09-11 10:05:00,5865, But where's the chain...I don't see no chain...
620362,irishfield,2011-09-11 21:30:00,26272,Do you need better glasses Bob??
620746,Darrel,2011-09-12 20:25:00,82,"Oh Irishfield, ya beat me to it, with the chained pickerel!!! LOL. Must be the Irish humor!! I know, because I am a proud one!! And as far as the pickerel walleye debate, doesn't it come from which side of the border you're on? When I was in my teens, my aunt owned a lodge in Temagami and the Pennsylvanian angler cabin renters would call them walleyes, yet never heard them refered to as pickerel . Tomato... tomoto?  BTW, their lodge was on Angus Lake on highway 11 and it was called Ridgewood. Being from that area, maybe you heard of it?"
619524,chessy,2011-09-08 15:45:00,610,just heard today that there was a chain pickerl caught off of wopus (sp )  island today .. another invasive fish coming our way
619525,Raf,2011-09-08 15:57:00,3495, chain pickerel are native to canada and ontario although in small numbers.  there are more of them in quebec and east.
619527,ctranter,2011-09-08 16:15:00,543,"Taken from the wiki page about chain pickerel:  ""Pickerel is often a name given to walleye, although the true name belongs to the chain pickerel""  debate over."
619533,chessy,2011-09-08 16:38:00,610,"@ctranter.. it was a chain pickerel that was caught...3 lbs the commercial fishermen have been catching a few as well.. The chain pickerel, Esox niger (syn. Esox reticulatus), is a species of freshwater fish in the pike family (family Esocidae) of order Esociformes. The chain pickerel as well as the trout pickerel and the grass pickerel belong to the Esox genus of pikes.[1The chain pickerel has a distinctive dark chain-like pattern on its greenish sides. Its body outline resembles that of the northern pike. May reach up to 30 inches only on rare occasions. The opercles and cheeks of the fish are entirely scaled.[1] The average size for chain pickerel, however, is 24 inches and 3 pounds. (The average chain pickerel caught by fishermen is under 2 pounds). The world record is 9 pounds, 6 ounces.]"
619534,ctranter,2011-09-08 16:43:00,543,Hi thanks I know what was caught.  In case you didn't know people debate over the proper term for walleye... my comment was in regards to that.
619537,chessy,2011-09-08 16:47:00,610,@ ctranter... sorry miss understood... thanks for the info
619555,fishindevil,2011-09-08 17:25:00,6254,"i was waiting for the pickerel,walleye debate to surface soon,as its been at least 3 months since it was brought up for the 5,000 time !!! lol...lol... now you went and started the chain pickerel debate...or is it chain walleye !!! lmao"
619559,skidoosafari,2011-09-08 17:31:00,46,  Its a grass pike not a chain pickeral
619565,tb4me,2011-09-08 17:38:00,3295,never heard of one...there is a good picture of one here... http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Esox_niger_1.jpg they look like pike to me..
619574,Roy,2011-09-08 18:15:00,13728," Yes they would look like pike being of the same family, ESOX. They've got a shorter trappier body than a pike and their markings are always the same. It looks like chain work. Lots of them down this way. Here's one my grandaughter caught shore fishing. "
619588,jimmer,2011-09-08 18:46:00,2730,That looks like a rather large chain pickerel Roy or is that the normal size?
619597,Roy,2011-09-08 19:05:00,13728,Yeah Jimmer... That one is a little bigger than normal for that water. Most are around 2- 2.5 lbs. Catching anything over 5lbs is akin to landing a 5+ bass.
619622,jimmer,2011-09-08 20:09:00,2730,That's a good looking fish. I have only caught a tiny one down in the Florida Everglades.
619660,Roy,2011-09-08 22:22:00,13728, I didn't think they'd be that far south.
619688,tightline,2011-09-08 23:47:00,322,If they taste like pike and Walleye  ..hahaha...Where can I get'm????
619692,livinisfishin,2011-09-09 00:00:00,661,Another species I want to add to my collection!
619711,ccmtcanada,2011-09-09 01:08:00,7971,That's a really cool looking fish.  Roy...that's a huge one in that pic!
619737,adolson,2011-09-09 02:30:00,783,See image below for assistance.
619741,phatpelkey,2011-09-09 02:46:00,78,"man if i got one of those i would probly thinkn it was a pike, never really see any around my parts"
619746,irishfield,2011-09-09 02:50:00,26272,"I always thought that these were ""chained"" Pickeral!  "
619757,mercman,2011-09-09 03:28:00,7054," Seeing as they have sharp teeth, count yourself lucky they are leaving your Parts alone"
619783,Billy Bob,2011-09-09 10:32:00,5865,"We have our fair share of ""chain pickerel"" in our state....Oneida Lake which is know for it's walleye population has been producing more and more pickerel because the weeds are growing within  deep waters because of the zebra mussel population....probably not a good thing.  Here's a couple from Oneida Lake.... "
619789,Jer,2011-09-09 10:52:00,1426,Looks like you got both kinds of pickerel there...
619838,Lunker777,2011-09-09 13:39:00,866, I fished a lake just east of Orlando... I forget the name now. But we caught 10+ Chain Pickerel in about 2 hours.... Along with some bass ! haha
619896,Billy Bob,2011-09-09 16:52:00,5865, YEP.......
