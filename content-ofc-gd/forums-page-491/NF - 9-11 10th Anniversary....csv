I was starting all over again, my oldest was 2 1/2 weeks old then as well. I was preping for my 2nd day of class of my aprenticeship. I had the tv on, on low. Samantha was beside me in her seat. I was studying and my now ex was sleeping as usuall I looked up and saw the footage on chch, holy cow, I was almost in tears. Then came the second crash. No need to disclose how I feel, but what the inocent folks dealt with that day. I cannot put into words. I show my girls a few vids from you tube once in a while. Yes, they were in tears alright, particularily for all that suffered that day. So to all that lost a friend, a family member, a coworker, my sincere condolences to you all. It just seems like it happened yesterday"

I would drive with 3 other guys they had not heard it yet so I told them what was going on then we listened to AM radio to get more details.  We all decided that we would full flat out for the boarder before it was shut down or plains ran into it. what a crazy feeling came over me when we headed through Toledo and again up in Michagian when we were around the air ports and there were no planes in the sky.  We made it to the bridge in Detroit just as they were closing it I was one of the last trucks to cross before they closed it.  It was a crazy day on the hi-way as there was little traffic out there. All I could think about way my wife and daughter who was just 1 1/2 years old then. The best part is they had no clue as Elmo was on our T.V. so the wife was not worried about us getting stuck in the USA or worse on the bridge.  I just finished watching some video on you tube my son cam in and had alot more questions it sure is hard to tell him what happened with out messing his head up. I hope I did a good job but he still does not understand why fire men and police were running into the building when they were going to fall down.  RIP to all that lost there lives 10 years ago and Thank you to all who have given there lives to save others.

People were coming and going thinking that some small plane had accidentally flow into the building. When the 2nd plane hit and then the first tower fell, the mood changed from wonder and awe to OMG, this is some serious crap.

I remember how mad I got at my girlfriend/now-wife because she couldn't understand the 'over reaction' and why people were being sent home early. She had only caught bits and pieces of the news and I remember her apologizing profusely later in the day when she really understood the magnitude of what happened. I was in full on panic mode thinking that we just witnessed the start of WW3 and the US was going to start dropping Nukes all over the middle east. I remember going to my friends house that night and watching the President address the nation. And I remember standing outside that night, amazed that for the first time in my lifetime, there were no planes in the sky.  On my last trip to NY in Sept, I visited Ground Zero for the 1st time and walked through the 9/11 memorial center. It was heart wrenching and overwhelming. I think i used up a half box of tissues myself. And to look over the site and imagine that two massive 100+ floor buildings came crashing to the ground was almost too much for me to comprehend if I hadn't seen it with my own eyes.  I'll never forget that day..."
619578,tb4me,2011-09-08 18:26:00,3295,"isn't it interesting how many of us were touched by Howard Stern that day.. I was driving to work after sleeping in all stressed right out. I had just been to timmies to get my daily double double. I was stopped at a red light in Brantford when Howard and Robin were starting to totally freak out. I immediately turned around and went home to tell me wife what had just happened. We put it on CNN in time to see the first tower smoking. There was all kinds of speculation as to what was going on at that point.. Just then the second plane hit tower 2. My wife right then and there put her hands over mouth and began crying. I remember the feeling that this wasn't real and this must be some sort of movie footage. When the 3rd plane hit the pentagon and the 4th crashed I knew we were under attack. I right away went and picked the kids up from school. I didn't want to find out schools were on the agenda of terrorists that day, so i took no chances. Here's something that the Howard Stern listeners can confirm to me from that day...Did they not say that they had callers call in to report that they had seen that the 4th plane was shot down by US military? I distinctively remember Howard saying Oh my god , I couldn't imagine the pilot of the fighter jet that had to shoot that plane down.  Then not another word in regard to that..I also remember Howard staying on the air till after 11:30 am as they were locked down in their building, reporting the entire time. That day did change our way of life to some degree. However with the back bone that the New Yorkers had shown that day sure impressed the HELL out of me. It just goes to show how terror and fear brings us all together for the common good in us all.."
619579,fishing n autograph,2011-09-08 18:27:00,2540,I woke up at 8:30 and got ready for school. I was in my second year of university. When i got out of the shower my mother was watching the news and told me a plane had struck one of the world trade towers. That was the time when no one really knew what happened. So i left for school. When I got home three hours later my mother told me a second plane had struck the towers and they both came down. That night I had a class and my prof was from NYC and was in tears the whole lecture

A few friends and I watched the towers come down on live TV.  During all the commotion, we heard a loud bang..  Later found out (totally un-related) that it was my neighbour blowing his brains out with a high power hunting rifle..  We saw all the police cars there on our way back to school."

619594,Garry2Rs,2011-09-08 19:01:00,1425,"On Sept 11th 2001 I was fishing the Grand River between Dunnville and Lake Eire. No phone, no radio, just me in the boat until dark.  I did notice one strange thing...Normally there were dozens of contrails from all the jets crossing the lake.  That day there were none!  I shrugged it off to some strange atmospheric condition.  That evening, when I started to drive home, I learned of the attack.  In a way, while it was still very tragic and shocking, it was somewhat easier to learn in that way. By then, most of the facts were known.  I'm sure that folks who were watching all day must have struggled through the many conflicting reports, speculations and rumours.  I'm old enough to remember the day JFK was killed in Dallas.  I was watching TV when the news broke...At first it was a report of shots fired at the motorcade, then confirmation of shots, but the President was unhurt, then that he had been taken to the Parkland Hospital, and finally Walter Cronkite took off his glasses, wiped his eyes and reported that the President was dead.  On 9-11 I was spared all that and basically got the whole story at once.  Of all the stories to come out of that day, one of the least told is of the skill of Canadian air traffic control and Transport Canada officials in landing about 250 unscheduled airliners on the East Coast.  American air space was closed and the dession was made that it was too dangerous to reroute planes to cities like Montreal and Toronto.  There might be Terrorist on board any of those flights.  It's very moving to me, the way that local people pitch in to help take care of those thousands and thousands of travellers who were stranded in Canada for the next five days.  I recall that more than 6000 passengers landed in Gander Nfld, a town of only 10,000 people.  Somehow they were fed, and housed.  Things like transportation and showers were arranged, crated pets were cared for, prescriptions were filled, and all without cost...This is the type of generosity and quite heroism that gets lost in the retelling of the more dramatic events of that day and the days that followed.  One small sidebar is that Transport Canada fell back on the Y2K emergency plans that were not needed, but were still on file... Garry2R's"
