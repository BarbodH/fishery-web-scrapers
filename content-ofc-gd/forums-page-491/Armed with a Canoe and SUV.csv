We're from Toronto, looking for a piking spot not more than a few hours away that we can hit with our canoe for one or two days.  Lake Ontario:  We've fished Frenchmen's bay in July/August with no luck whatsoever.  I saw one guy catch a Freshwater Drum... that's it. Lake Simcoe:  Looking for something smaller to take the canoe out onto... smaller and calmer.  Anybody got a choice lake in the Kawarthas or something?  A lake that isn't all private.  A lot of them are.  If we just pick a random lake on Google Maps we might get stuck with private property.  Thanks for the help!  EDIT:  Just wanted to add that I like wilderness.  We wouldn't hesitate to pack a tent and portage.  My first and only pike was caught portaging in Killarney PP."
