Things worked out better than anticipated. I think those 2 cold nights last week really firmed things up. There is still a good 2.5"" of ice out there.  Just be careful, there are a few larger cracks starting to open up. I took a pic of the girls on the ice.  The girls probably should have been wearing survival suits but they probably would have got heat stroke due to the 19 degree temps outside. "

676655,Skud,2012-03-16 04:35:00,739,Good of you to have the young ladies go on the ice bare footed. It will get them used to the cold tile floors in the kitchen. That's what I call 'future planning'.
