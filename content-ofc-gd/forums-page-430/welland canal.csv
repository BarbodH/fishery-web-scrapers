676573,Frank,2012-03-16 00:31:00,74," The old Welland Canal is a good place to start, anywhere from Dain City to just before the Highway 406 bridge... Just beware that canoeing past the Highway 406 bridge is not allowed right now due to the widening of the 406, they are building another bridge beside the current one. Also if you wish there are a few spots from downtown Welland where you can launch a canoe into the Welland River to get some fishing in.  If you would like any info/help shoot me a PM."
