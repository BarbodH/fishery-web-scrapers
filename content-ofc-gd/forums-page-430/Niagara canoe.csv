676206,Christopheraaron,2012-03-14 21:37:00,3525,"Alright I am heading down to the niagara area this weekend and I would like to have access to a canoe does anyone know where I could rent one, it would need to be within the St. Catherines, Welland, niagara area, we can't drive very far with it."
676212,davey buoy,2012-03-14 21:56:00,5505,Hope you can paddle fast or a good anchor LOL.
676214,dannyboy,2012-03-14 22:06:00,367,Try Outdoors Oriented They are in St Catharines near Vansickle and 4th Ave.  Dan
676217,Billy Bob,2012-03-14 22:28:00,5865,Do you know any natives that live in the area.....most I know drowned while canoeing in the Niagara River.....  Seriously.......where are you intending to use this canoe ? ? ?
676221,Christopheraaron,2012-03-14 22:39:00,3525," no, I'm not doing the niagara river if that's what you meant, and for the record ya, I can paddle that fast! I'm doing the welland canals."
676224,Christopheraaron,2012-03-14 22:44:00,3525," Ya, I looked at them, what they say on their website leads me to believe is that I can only rent if I'm going to buy a new boat or am I wrong?"
676264,Christopheraaron,2012-03-15 01:33:00,3525,Any other options? I emailed outdoors oriented and they said their rental season doesn't start until may.
676277,captpierre,2012-03-15 02:11:00,2521,Are you saying you are canoeing the locks and connecting canal?
676287,Rod Caster,2012-03-15 02:25:00,5784,  Another option? Buy a cheap sportspal for $200 and you'll be in business no matter where you go.
676296,Dabluz,2012-03-15 02:38:00,701,  Then if you no longer want to use it.....you can sell it for 250 dollars...lol.
676299,Rod Caster,2012-03-15 02:41:00,5784,"  Got my 12 footer for $50, fixed it a bit, sold it for $75 and then bought a 14 footer for $200. They're out there!"
676320,BillM,2012-03-15 03:12:00,17367, I'm guessing he'll be fishing around Welland.
676367,Christopheraaron,2012-03-15 13:17:00,3525,"Ya, welland area I might even buying a used one but I just bought a brand new scott and it's still being built, anyplace in hamilton I could get one?"
676393,Gerritt,2012-03-15 15:14:00,6129,
676421,Christopheraaron,2012-03-15 16:44:00,3525, I emailed them and they have rentals!  thanks Gerritt!
676570,Frank,2012-03-16 00:24:00,74,"I would of lent you my 16' canoe for just a cash safety deposit, but I am currently working on mine. Glad you found a place that rents them."
676638,SirCranksalot,2012-03-16 02:54:00,3291,"I'm glad you found a canoe, but I don't think you should use ""Niagara"" and ""canoe"" in the same sentence!"
676802,Christopheraaron,2012-03-16 17:26:00,3525," Maybe, but it got your attention didn't it?"
