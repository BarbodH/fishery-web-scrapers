Ive attempted trout salmon muskies and carp with no success. I joined this site to learn more techniques and maybe land a carp or salmonoid. I also just read this online and thought it was a fascinating read for anyone that lives in Hamilton it also makes me see coots paradise and the desjardin canal differently.  http://www.historyco...1/bouchier.html      Tight lines   josh"
