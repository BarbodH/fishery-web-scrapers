676400,Sketty55,2012-03-15 15:45:00,52,"Thanks to all for your responses. Lot's of great info to start my mission! One specific topic I'm wondering about at this point, what handling techniques are advised for this species. I realize a large net is required, but once out of the net, is there techniques that are preferrable which will cause the least amount of injury?"
676410,BillM,2012-03-15 16:16:00,17367," Most guys I know us a cradle to control the fish in the water while they get rid of the hooks..  Once they've done that, it's either back in the drink or out for a quick pic then off she goes!"
676414,Dontcryformejanhrdina,2012-03-15 16:20:00,535,"  Grab it by the gill plate and support it's body with your other hand, hold on tight because they are very slippery and will sometimes headshake while you're holding them. Just minimize the time out of the water (unhook, get your camera ready, etc.. while the musky is still in the net in the water).  I struggled BIG time when I first got into it last year because it was completely new to me and I didn't know anybody who fished for them. The biggest mistake I made starting out was to fish for them in low numbers waters instead of more populated lakes/rivers. Find a good numbers lake and just keep fishing it. Finding somebody experienced to fish with will help a ton too. I'm not the most experienced guy but if you ever want to try for musky around the quinte area give me a shout. I'm still learning myself but I'd be more than happy to help out somebody new to musky fishing since it's still very fresh in my mind how tough it is starting out by yourself.  -Christopher"
676415,Tom McCutcheon,2012-03-15 16:22:00,627,"Most damaging to the fish, is the time spent out of the water. After you have unhooked the fish, put it back in the net resting in the water beside the boat. Here it can revive while you rest and revive....and get your camera and smile ready. When you hold a fish up for the photo, please cradle it under the belly away from your body slightly. This does not remove any of the protective slime from the fish onto your shirt or jacket and also supports the internal organs in their natural position One other item I will mention, and it is a contentious one which has been debated. Only legal length fish should be removed for photos. I know you will be proud of any muskie caught and would like to show it but you are leaving yourself open for a fine by a CO if he witnessed the photo of a sub legal fish. As you gain experience you will learn which fish are PHOTO OPS.  Good luck  One thing I forgot. Do not lay the fish on the floor or boat seats to remove hooks or measure it. This can all be done in the water, in the net."
676474,peter23,2012-03-15 19:37:00,95,"i am 16 years old and just started musky fishing last season, i went overboard on the rod and reel. my first combo was a calcutta 400 te and a st croix premier rod. it is amazing. let me just tell you it is the most addicting thing in the world but costs a lot of money. number one thing is proper release tools. a big net, long pliers, and bolt cutters are a must. if you are starting out , the kawarthas will produce numbers of muskie. i have only been fishing musky for a couple months last season and have already landed about a dozen decent sized muskie. just try not to get too addicted lol or your wallet will be affected."
676668,outllaw,2012-03-16 10:06:00,1232,"first,,remove yourself from any family commitments. get a line of credit. begin taking anti-psycotic drugs before fishing.. find a partner thats hard of hearing.dogs are great.. from there you can invest in using every waking moment chasing big slimey,stinky fish. as for tools the guys filled that part in very well.. in 1 years time if you arent talking to yourself,you have missed something."

673944,Sketty55,2012-03-07 19:56:00,52,"Ok, so i realize this is a broad topic, so maybe we can just start with resources on the web that I should review before proceeding any further. I'm a long time bassman and I realize that musky is quite different and I'll need knowledge on gear, species handling, techniques, etc before I can actually get out there. I'm not lazy so i'm hoping some of the more experienced anglers on here can point me in the right direction. Any articles or previous info I should take a look at? As far as gear, I'm not looking for top of the line, but I want to make sure i have the proper equipment so that I can release a healthy fish back in the water (that is if ever catch one!)."

If you're not sure you want to commit the membership fee, go to a local chapter meeting and sit in on the action. I'm sure once you get to see the passion these guys have for muskie fishing, you'll have no trouble reaching into your pocket.

Big Net (bigger the better, or a cradle if you can't afford a big net) Good set of Hook cutters Pliers with a long handle for removing hooks Get a big stout rod - A cheap but decent one is a Daiwa Heartland Musky rod Grab an Abu Garcia C3 6500 or 6501 bait casting reel Spool of 75-100 pound power pro 2 or 3 16-24 inch long 120-150 pound florocarbon Leaders with strong snap swivels  Now for baits Start out with start off with a 12"" jointed  Hard body that you can drag around behind your boat and a Big spinner bait designed for musky, you can troll this or cast it.

673995,Weeds,2012-03-07 22:07:00,782,"As far as gear goes I'd suggest buying a quality Rod  but used. I love the St. Croix line but in your research you'll come across alot of other good ones.  You'll end up paying less than you would for a mediocre new rod and if you find you don't get into musky fishing in a big way you can resell it for very close to what you paid for it. 7'6 MH is a versatile rod. Likewise, don't go crazy regarding lures, although its fun and gets addictive quick.  Start with 3 or 4 lures. Their was a recent thread where folks choose their favourites."

674006,Tom McCutcheon,2012-03-07 22:36:00,627,"As just about everyone has said, learn from an experienced angler. they will show you the proper techniques for specific baits. How to ""work it"" properly. They will also explain and show you the proper release procedures once you have hooked and landed your first fish. The other good piece of advice others have mentioned is to get out to one of the Muskies Canada meetings www.muskiescanada.ca. There is a chapter in Mississauga. They are open to the public and there is no pressure or obligation to join. Once you have met some of the guys you may feel it is something you wish to become involved with. Oh Ya!!!!

674011,Gregoire,2012-03-07 22:48:00,1397,The only other thing I would say would be try to locate fish. This can be easier to do on bodies of water where there is a higher density. That us where I would suggest you start.

674020,Pigeontroller,2012-03-07 23:25:00,2793,"Lots of good advise given. Proper release gear is key. A large Muskie-friendly net is a must, the idea is to leave the fish in the water, so the net acts as a big holding pen. Mini-bolt cutters, many badly hooked Muskie would not survive the C&R process if it weren't for cutting hooks...Long Nose pliers. For all their size and fierceness, Muskie are surprisingly fragile creatures...Great group of guys at the Mississauga Muskies Canada Chapter..."
674022,solopaddler,2012-03-07 23:29:00,8605,Beyond proper release gear and a suitable rod and reel which has been covered...in a nutshell grab some black/orange inline bucktails and cast alongside pretty much any weedline in the Kawarthas.

674031,tonka-toy,2012-03-07 23:58:00,139,"Great advice so far but the required equipment could easily run into the thousands in rods, reels, net ,giant needle-nose, bolt-cutters etc. I'm sure once you try it you'll be hooked but considering the investment it may make sense to drop a couple hundred on a guided trip to one of the Kwarthas (numbers lakes) before making the large financial committment. This way you can get a chance to see how useful and necessary all the specialty equipment is and also get to see area specific techniques and lure choices."

674054,Handlebarz,2012-03-08 01:26:00,3790,You have a lot of great info here to start with. I can suggest that you don't need top of the line everything to start. I would suggest going to CTC and getting the three pack long nose pliers they go on sale all the time and have rubber coated handles.  For bolt cutters CTC puts them on sale for $4 they do the trick for getting started you don't have to buy $50 kinpex to start.  Look around as nets are sold all the time or take a heavy non coated salmon net buy some rubber coating and dip it then pull it out be sure to open the net up so it hardens in the open position.  For rods look at etackle.ca they have good starting musky rods for good prices.
674055,Ron,2012-03-08 01:28:00,1683," Although, most of the suggestions are good. I think many of these board members forgot what they had for gear when they first started fishing for Muskie.  You say you are an avid Bass guy, so I would assume you would have a heavy flippen stick, say about 7ft or so long. If you are fortunate enough to have a good quality baitcaster, you need to only pick up up some heavy braid. I would suggest 65lb minimum but truth be known, 80 lb is better. 80 lb will not break on a back lash. Try in-line spinners for starters. You can get them in various weights so pick a couple up that your already existing rod and reel can handle. Favorite colors for the Kawarthas??? Walleye pattern- that would be light brown/yellow/white or light brown/yellow/orange. Rapala has a new lure, the gliding rap (about 3 yrs on the market). Pick up the Bluegill pattern, easy lure to figure out how to work.  Sure a net would be nice, but you know, I didn't buy a net until after fishing for muskie for 3 yrs. I did however, buy a pair of long needle nose pliers, crappy tire mini bolt cutters and a jaw spreader. If you do any salmon or rainbow fishing from piers, chances are good you have a landing net big enough for the majority of the Kawartha Lakes muskie.  Don't set your goals high for big fish when you first start out. Expect to catch fish in the max range of 40 inches, that seems to be standard for anyone who seems to just starts out fishing for muskie.  So, the long of it...  Buy: (prices are an estimate only)  80 lb power pro. 30.00 130lb flourocarbon leaders 12.00 long nose needle nose pliers 10.00 cheap bolt cutters 15.00 in-line walleye pattern bucktail spinner 18.00 Suick weighted 8"" fire tiger pattern Rapala gliding Rap (large size in bluegill or hot Olive) 18.00   There is about 150.00 spent just to see if you are going to enjoy it or not. It will be the best 150.00 spent if you find muskie fishing isn't what you thought it would be.  Once you get a taste of muskie fishing and you say to yourself ""This is what I'm talking!!! Booh ya!"", then you can seriously consider stepping up to the plate and upgrade your gear to ""muskie grade"".   There is my 2 cents worth of advice.  Cheers, Ron..."
674061,Handlebarz,2012-03-08 01:34:00,3790,Ron did you read my post then add to it??? I guess we're connected that's scary.
674063,Ron,2012-03-08 01:38:00,1683," Scary Mike, just scary! ha ha ha!"
674153,RSF,2012-03-08 08:10:00,47,"  They say, on average a legal Musky is landed after about 200 hours of angling for them. I've caught two, twenty minutes apart (they generally travel in pairs), that were both obviously undersize and out of season and released, I was trolling for walleye.  Anyway, after twenty or more years, that's the only muskies Iv'e caught. If you know that pike and musky are in the lake your fishing and you know where the pike are, look on the opposite side of the lake for musky. Musky spend the day cruising there territory while pike have small areas they consider their-own.  Pike spawning happens earlier than musky, so the fingerlings will be of large enough size that when musking spawn, pike fingerlings tend to eat the eggs. Therefore both species stay away from each other to the extreme. Pike of course are in the lillypads/weed and musky live in the slots or holes usually. People I know, itcluding a guy who caught a 47 lb musky in Moon River that I'd seen, used a huge dark suick (it sorta immitates a wounded fish and has to be strak fished). It destroyed his hard-rod/Penn LW 209 reel."
