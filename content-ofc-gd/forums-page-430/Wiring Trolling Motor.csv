My question is, can I used the existing plug and recepticle on the bow or do I need to upgrade them also?  Do I need to upgrade the wire and fuse from the recepticle to the batteries too? Or is the existing setup ok and all I need to do is take the plug off my old trolling motor and install it on the new one."

A 24v motor, of the same thrust rating, will draw half the amperage of the old 12volt motor... so you could go 24V and double the thrust of what you had previously and the wire would be just fine."
