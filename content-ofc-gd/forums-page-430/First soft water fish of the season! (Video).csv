676515,Diltsy,2012-03-15 22:30:00,22,"I got out yesterday for a few hours and decided to try for some pike. I bought myself a GoPro camera boxing week, so I figured it would be a goo opportunity to test it out! Here's a video of one of my catches. I ended up with 3 pike, all around the same size. Enjoy, and hope to have some awesome fishing videos this season! Diltsy   "

676640,ohhenrygsr,2012-03-16 03:09:00,947,That's awesome. What camera did you use and editing software?
676645,fishindude,2012-03-16 03:30:00,220," ^ GoPro camera  Nice video, I really enjoyed that. You captured the peace and calmness that fishing is for a lot of us I'm sure, gotta love it  Do you have more than 1 GoPro or did you have to ""re-shoot"" for some of those shots at other angles? If that makes sense"
