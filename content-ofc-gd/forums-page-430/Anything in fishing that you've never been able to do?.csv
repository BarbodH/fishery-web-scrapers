But I've made a sort of pledge that this year I'll try for a few of the salmonidae, so maybe they'll get rigged.   I'm of two minds when I see stuff like this. Part of me says that it's too precious to risk breaking, but another part says that it was meant to be used, and therefore should be. If it breaks, it dies an honourable death. And really, what is the difference between one that's on display that works and one that's on display and doesn't work? If it isn't working, it doesn't matter, it's only good for display! I would have a professional take a look at it and evaluate it for its current estimated durablity, availability of parts, etc., and if all looks good, put it into action. If not, get it mounted on a nice background, with some pics of your Dad around it. Preferably pics of him using it while he's fishing!"

About a week in I started having the same problem.  My problem was I forgot to bring more line so had no choice but to untangle what was a freakin disaster of a birdsnest.  After 2 or so hours of mind boggling magic I got it!  Next cast BAM!! did it again!!!!    Turns out I had a small nick in my spool cap some 220 grit wet, followed by a steel wool massage and I was back in business.  Do a thorough check of your equipment I couldn't see the nick but could feel it with my fingernails when I rubbed across and that was all it took. Hope you get it all figured out.  What kind of rod are you using? Maybe its too soft or hard for your casting style."
669230,camillj,2012-02-23 20:14:00,1988,One VERY common cause for this type of problem on spinning reels (and I am surprised everyone says they have never seen it before) ... is OVERSPOOLING the reel .... when you do that the line tends to fly off the reel too loosely when you cast (making you feel like you can cast farther) but unless you are VERY careful EVERY time you start your retrieve you create a mess that quickly turns into a disaster.   On the first pass reading this thread my assessment would have been line twist ... but this more often is manifested at the rod tip where the line keeps getting tangled around the tip ... if you dont over-spool then this sounds like it is either drag related (ruled out because you said it was tight) ... or .. as I used to find way back in the day with my old Mitchel 300's .. the anti-reverse dog would lose a tooth or two and the reel would not properly prevent 'back-reeling' - and thus a mess at the spool (not so much a problem with newer reels but was a problem with EVERY single Mitchell I owned (still not sure why I loved them so much

676404,doubleheader,2012-03-15 15:52:00,497,"The birdsnest thing can be caused by a variety of things. Again, assuming you meant baitcaster, it sounds like it's not the way you put your line on the reel because if it was and you let it out when you backlash (slow troll forward let all the line straighten behind the boat then reel in with some tension) you'd get rid of the line twist. It sounds to me like you aren't setting up the brake correctly or if you are, overcasting. Overcasting is pretty common for young strong guys. If that could be your case try feeling the rod load and just making a smooth delivery. It could be a deficiency in your reel also, do you experience this with more than one reel? It could also be the wrong line for that reel. Anyone who uses a baitcaster will occaisionally get a birdsnest, I know I do, and it's usually caused by overcasting."

668475,nlpaintballer,2012-02-21 12:12:00,122,"My friend had the same kind of problem Dave, and what he was doing was bouncing around the rod tip on the retrieve which was causing the line to spool too loose. He would reel in with the tip doing spastic elliptical movements up and down which would cause the line to lose tension. Try retrieving while pinching the line so it always has tension, if it still happens then it's probably a mechanical issue, if not then you know it's just slack line you're reeling for some reason. My buddy was able to do it with a St. Croix MH and a Stradic 3000 spooled with 40lb. PP, all my gear so I know it was working fine. When we switched gear he did the same thing on my gear, XH St.Croix with a ci4 4000 spooled with 40lb. PP, but not as bad because the XH rod tip wasn't whipping around as much on his retrieve.

It was pure lolz. OP it def has to be something your doing wrong, I've had the same cheap shimano spining since I was a wee lad (also other gear since, obviously) It might be because I've recently started using a baitcast, but I can't remember the last time any of my spinning gear ever failed.

I do tend to 'baby' my wrist a bit due to an occasional arthritic twinge, but I can't believe that's the only reason. I'm leaning toward a structural problem in the wrist and/or elbow.

668707,Spouph,2012-02-22 01:17:00,115," Awesome,  I can help, rod tip up and wax about four feet of your braided line from the lure back, this floats the line, snap the tip like your playing the drums.  The bait caster is alittle tougher, but loosen the magnets so the lure just starts to fall with the bail open,  start at a slower fall and as you get better, you can let it fall faster allowing to cast your bait further.  Another trick is to make a cast the pull out 10 to 15 extra feet of line, then put a peice of tape across the line on the reel, then reel in and cast normally.  this will prevent the birdsnest from getting to deep in your reel.  I got good at a bait caster years ago using this stuff.  However I stopped using my bait caster reel, because I broke my rod, a couple years ago.  Just purchased a new rod to get back into it, and I guarentee that I will have to learn all over again.  No there is nothing I can`t do just things that I need to practice.  Wouldnt it suck if you caught fish evertime or made that perfect cast.  I don`t think I would enjoy fishing as much as I do.  Funny though I find that this forum I one of the greatest tools I have ever used.  Just think how good a fisherman I could have been If I only found this forum  when I was younger and had the time. cheers and good luck"

Somewhere along the highway near Shining Tree, if I recall correctly, he knew of a shallow river that held rainbows. We turned over rocks to get small worms, and put them on a hook attached to a small double-bladed spinner. With just simple tackle we waded in and just kept hooking them, not big ones but a nice enough size for the 'shore lunch' my mother cooked up in the trailer. Man, wish I could do that again."

I've taken a few virtual drives around the area but I can't seem to find anything that rings a bell, but after all this time that's hardly surprising. I seem to recall it as being quite shallow, tons of small rocks, maybe 30' wide (but that's really stretching the memory), and very overgrown with trees at the edges, I think we had to wade rather than walk a non-existent shoreline. I believe it went under the road at about a right angle, but again, it's been a long time. I should call him up and see if he remembers any more than I do. He probably does, I've got a good memory but it's short."

With my Baitcaster, i cast with my right hand, and before the lure hits the water, my rod is in my left hand, and i'm ready to retrieve. It just feels natural. As far as birdsnests, the only time i may get one, is if i am not paying attention and let go of the thumb bar too early or too late. Never ever had a birdsnest on a spining reel. I have had the line loop over the bail on occasion, and had the line wrap around the outside of the reel housing."

668365,bigugli,2012-02-21 00:45:00,6138,It's easy to birdnest a line if you start reeling in very loose line without any tension. You end up reeling in loops of twisted line and that is the start of the birdsnest. Lesson learnt from years of untangling kids reels and watching them go back and tangle again a few casts later.
668366,Dave Bailey,2012-02-21 00:45:00,1641,"Okay mods, lock this one up before I get even more frustrated.

668385,mercman,2012-02-21 01:27:00,7054," Well then, here are some other things, not related to your 2 root canals,which may be the culprit.  1) You are over spooling the reel with line. 2) you are using lures/weights that are too light for the reel to spool correctly. 3) you are not adding enough tension to the line when filling the spool. 4) your rod is not able to handle the speed the line comes off the reel ( mix matched system) and causing a back lash by the time it hits the first guide. 5) You are making hard casts with the drag set very low on the reel which causes the spool to spin while line is coming off the reel."
668395,MJL,2012-02-21 01:40:00,2427,"Bird’s nest on spinning reels...It happens  Number of reasons but line twist usually is the case. Some things you can try.  1. Feather the spool on the cast with your index finger...Line can’t explode off the spool if you won’t let it  2. Don’t over fill your spool  3. Prevent line twist when you’re spooling up...Usually that means spooling up your reel with the line spool on the floor and label side up...If you’re noticing line twist when you’re spooling up, stop - Line twist will not magically go away on its own. Adding tension to the line and running it through your fingers when you're spooling up will remove most line twist  4. Prevent line twist while you’re fishing – Use decent swivels  5. Use a limp mono...Stiff mono generally has a tendency to jump off the spool of your reel when you’re casting...for lines 8lb test or higher, I like to soak my lines in warm water for a few minutes after spooling up. I dunk the reel spool into a tub of warm water and the line will bed up nicely. I usually do that after I’ve taken the drag washers out for re-lubing."
668398,Fisherman,2012-02-21 01:42:00,7201," A good quality ball bearing swivel ""may"" alleviate some of the mess closer to the end of the line before the lure.  However, honestly,  I'm tending to believe that you are one of ""those"" guys who keeps playing with the drag.  What follows is what I meant very early in the thread about the spool turning while reeling or cranking.  When the drag or tension is properly set per rod/line, the spool itself will not turn while you are cranking in line.  If it does, then either you have played with the drag again or the fish is actually taking line. Don't crank while the spool is turning. It causes line twist.  I see guys doing it quite often, once the drag is set, there's no need to  adjust it."
668429,Dave Bailey,2012-02-21 02:51:00,1641," It strats with a lot and still happens after it's been shortened through continuous backlashes followed by shortening.   I use all sorts of lures on the same rods and reels, from little Chug Bugs to heavy spoons.   As I've said repeatedly, it's happened after all respoolings, I can't believe that every single respooling has been done the same wrong way.   Possibly, but again, every combo I've used has been a bad one?   No, as I said before, my drag is always tightened fully.  Look folks, the only constant in all this is me. It obviously has nothing to do with the rod, the reel, the line, the lure, or the swivels. I'm willing to just let it go and live with it. There isn't a suggestion in this entire thread that hasn't been tried before, so there's nothing more that can be done."

Combined with something in the retrieve?  I have never heard of this issue before.  If you don't figure it out you are just going to have to start trolling and hope for the best. :-p
668299,pikehunters,2012-02-20 22:25:00,40,"  I agree!! swivel helps reduce line twist always use them. Make sure your reel is facing down, while operating. If your R handed the handle should be in L hand or vise versa & check your drag setting.  Don't give up the ship we'll get it!!"
668301,Twocoda,2012-02-20 22:29:00,4130,might want to check and make sure your line isnt getting pinched in the bail roller too....i had a reel that was worn out and it had the same problem....it would only catch ever so often just enough to mess up a line....so make sure your bail components are tightened up....then check everything else to see if there is ANYTHING your line could be catching on....including up the rod through the eyes
668304,Dave Bailey,2012-02-20 22:35:00,1641," I'll sometimes retrieve like that, had some success with pike grabbing a spoon as it flutters down between pulls. But it happens even if I'm rapidly retrieving spinner baits without any rest."
668307,Lungelarry,2012-02-20 22:42:00,294,"Did you ever think to cast out a spinnerbait,look at your reel while reeling in,I,m sure you will see the problem,cause this sure is strange.You should also switch to braid,I hate mono on spinning."
668309,pikehunters,2012-02-20 22:43:00,40,"check your eyelets is the ceramic gone, mainly the end one. something has to be causing drag & stretching your line"
668312,Dave Bailey,2012-02-20 22:48:00,1641," Tried braid last year, humungous snarl on my second cast. And the third, and the fifth... Went straight back to Tightline within 1/2 an hour and had it replaced with mono. The braid is now being used for home-made leaders."
668314,pikehunters,2012-02-20 22:55:00,40,  Wow sure sounds like a baitcaster not a spincaster. Agree with lungelarry cast it out have someone watch your line in & out. go to your local bait shop with rod in hand & show them whats going on
668316,Roy,2012-02-20 23:00:00,13728,"So let me get this straight Dave, you've been fishing for 50 years and you still have major problems with casting with a spinning reel? This is not a slight but I'm really thinking that either you're pulling our collective legs or we have to get the community together to buy you the biggest and best endurance/tolerance trophy we can afford."
668318,Twocoda,2012-02-20 23:03:00,4130,i figured out the problem....yeah me!!!!!!!!!!!!......i bet a dollar to a donut...your running junk swivels....happens to cheaterlines all the time if your running garbage swivels....Berkley crosslocks are the best IMO
668319,pikehunters,2012-02-20 23:04:00,40,  LOL!! I'm going back to my bucket beer drinking game!
668321,Dave Bailey,2012-02-20 23:06:00,1641,Looks like we've exhausted this one. Guess I'll just have to buy line by the kilometre for a bulk discount. I'm guessing that there's something unusual about the structure of my wrists and/or forearms that prevents me doing what others do.
668323,Dave Bailey,2012-02-20 23:08:00,1641," Fished a lot as a kid but didn't start again until a few years ago, and even then only once or twice a year. Only began to get out more often in the past 5 years or so."
668324,Dave Bailey,2012-02-20 23:10:00,1641, I've tried all sorts.
668325,Twocoda,2012-02-20 23:11:00,4130,  lawn darts for you then....if ya watch the garage sales you might find the pointy ones
668327,davey buoy,2012-02-20 23:18:00,5505,You wouldn't have a picture of the reel and the tangled mess Dave?
668328,pikehunters,2012-02-20 23:21:00,40,  I think we may have exhausted the obvious points but take your rig to a local bait shop & show them whats going on. I'm sure its some combo problem with your casting style being matched up with the rite rod & reel.  The pole has as much to do with it as your reel keep us posted!!
668332,DRIFTER_016,2012-02-20 23:28:00,10439,  I can't side cast or spinning side cast to save my life.    :rofl2: Been pin fishing for 30 years and use my own strange spinning pull cast thing. I have real difficulty when I'm showing new pinners how to cast because I look like an epileptic when I try to side cast!!!!    :rofl2: My students seem to pick it up quickly though.    :dunno:
668333,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2012-02-20 23:31:00,0,the reel problem sounds like you're reeling slack line.
668334,Dave Bailey,2012-02-20 23:33:00,1641, Close approximation:  
668335,pikehunters,2012-02-20 23:34:00,40,how about 43 replies with 84 views Dave you got it rockin!!  Sorry off topic    !!
668336,Roy,2012-02-20 23:36:00,13728,We've been had.
668337,Whitespinnerbait,2012-02-20 23:39:00,2038,"  Sounds like you've had one BAILEY'S too many !!  You should have given up fishing a long time ago !!  There is no hope for you at mastering a simple cast, give it up NOW !!!"
668339,Wolf 3,2012-02-20 23:41:00,134," Hook, line and sinker..."
668340,Twocoda,2012-02-20 23:43:00,4130,not even a kiss either....oh well....im sure it will happen again...
668260,Dave Bailey,2012-02-20 20:46:00,1641,"I'm sure many of us have something that has always eluded us, but I've got two that are very frustrating. First, I've never been able to 'walk the dog', no matter how much I try. I have been trying for years, with different rods, reels, lines, and yet that damned Zara Spook refuses to act the way anyone else can get it. Never. I even had a guy try to show me once, and after trying for about half an hour we both gave up. I guess my wrists just aren't configured properly (bones, ligaments, whatever) so I can't get the proper action going.  Oh well, there are plenty of other techniques, so I've permanently given up on ever getting it to save myself the frustration. I just have to live with the undeniable fact that it isn't possible for me to do it.  The second is a lot more frustrating. I've rarely been able to go more than a dozen casts without having a massive birdnest develop that is usually only corrected by cutting off massive amounts of line. I was once told that it's the sign of a problem with whatever spinning reel I'm using, if so, it must be catching because every reel I've ever used goes the same way. So I've developed a routine; about a dozen casts, and then hook the end of the line to something, walk back until the reel is empty, and then walk forward reeling it back in under tension. Doesn't always work, sometimes it'll happen sooner so I'm reduced to hacking at line again. A couple of times I've made two trips in one day to the closest tackle shop to where I'm fishing just to have a new line spooled on.  Other than giving up fishing, any suggestions?"
668262,Roy,2012-02-20 20:50:00,13728,"Those are two SERIOUS problems and honestly, I've never heard that from anyone."
668263,Dave Bailey,2012-02-20 20:55:00,1641," The first isn't serious. As I said, there are plenty of other techniques. If I ever find out that I can't drop-shot I'll throw myself under a train."
668264,workwear,2012-02-20 20:57:00,592,dont sweat it dave.......ive managed to get a few serious birds nests on a real that is supposed to be backlash proof.!!!!!  the dc calais....just ask jose  i can still hear him laughing at me whenever i pick that reel up  im pretty sure tho its just takes a few tweaks of the setting on your baitcaster
668265,Fisherman,2012-02-20 21:01:00,7201," He said spincast, maybe a mistake.   If it is a spincast, then he's reeling while the spool is turning on the reel and that causes line twist."
668266,mercman,2012-02-20 21:02:00,7054,"Walk the dog, here too. I bought 4 Badonk-a-Donks(cause i like the name ) and i cant make then walk if my life depended on it. The other is, i LH retrieve with a Spinning reel, and i RH retrieve with a baitcater, but i cant do the opposite.It just feels like i am all thumbs when i try. People think its weird."
668267,Roy,2012-02-20 21:03:00,13728," Yes, or he's putting his line on backwards."
668268,Twocoda,2012-02-20 21:04:00,4130,"i would have to say the wallice cast.....i can do it after 6 or 7 attempts but the next day its like someone hit the ""reset"" button in my brain and i have to start from scratch all over again .....hence the reason im a fulltime spinning sidecaster.....  for your backlask problem....try a different pound test of line ...until you find onethat flows to your liking....for me its 14 pond on the baitcaster....12 and i get problems   edit to add with out editing- Im a master of typonese"
668269,workwear,2012-02-20 21:07:00,592,ooops sorry...thought we were talking bout a baitcaster...ok then ya as roy said...you have a problem....  what type of line are ya using...braid should not give ya a birds nest..not on a spinning outfit...
668270,Dave Bailey,2012-02-20 21:07:00,1641," No, I said a spinning reel, one of them open face thingies. And how do you manage to NOT reel in while it's turning? It can't wind back in on its own. You have to turn the handle to retrieve the lure, right? And doesn't that turn the spool? Don't tell me I've even been getting that wrong."
668271,Dave Bailey,2012-02-20 21:12:00,1641," If so, then it's been put on backward every time by myself or whoever else has done it, including a number of tackle shops. Hard to believe...   I've tried all sorts of brands in all sorts of tests from 6 to around 12, no difference."
668272,Lungelarry,2012-02-20 21:15:00,294,"Something is not right here, birdsnest on spinning..............only thing I can think of is you use really cheap mono"
668273,Roy,2012-02-20 21:16:00,13728,I'd like to know what line you're using with a walk the dog bait. You'll have a lot more trouble if you're using fluorocarbon or braid especially when first starting out. Use a heavy mono line 12lb +
668276,Dave Bailey,2012-02-20 21:20:00,1641," I don't care about not being able to walk the dog, it's something I'll never get. But I would like to solve the reel problem."
668277,Dave Bailey,2012-02-20 21:21:00,1641," Like I said, I've tried all sorts."
668279,Acountdeleted,2012-02-20 21:36:00,2562,"I can't seem to catch salmonids for the life of me (Trout, Salmon etc etc). I don't know why. They just don't like me."
668280,pikehunters,2012-02-20 21:46:00,40,"Other than giving up fishing, any suggestions?   Not in my vocabulary!! Sounds like a combo of casting style. Hang time on lure & are you using a swivel. Stick a 5 gal bucket in yard or driveway & attack it side cast, loft cast or line drive cast. Find one inbetween that works. You can also turn this into a drinking game miss the bucket & drink!!!!!!!!!!  Oh & use an old jig or old lure with no hooks!!!"
668284,Wolf 3,2012-02-20 21:59:00,134,"A birdnest every dozen casts?  You must be a very patient man.  Here is a link that shows you how to spool line on a spinning reel to reduce birdnests  Also, if you are not doing so already,  try closing the bail manually after you cast and give the line a tug before starting to reel.  Good luck   Edit to fix link"
668286,Roy,2012-02-20 22:03:00,13728," Sorry, thought it was important as you'd listed it first."
668288,Dave Bailey,2012-02-20 22:06:00,1641," As I said a couple of times before, it's been spooled many times by many people, hasn't made any difference. And I've also tried closing the bail by hand, no joy."
668291,Dave Bailey,2012-02-20 22:08:00,1641, Are you saying I SHOULD or SHOULD NOT use a swivel?
668293,Twocoda,2012-02-20 22:12:00,4130," on a spinning reel? hmmmm i would say make sure your drag is set to ""tight"" when spooling it ...when retrieving your line from fishing make sure you are tight enough that the drag isnt fighting your line...this will cause no movement in your line but the reel is still rotating causing the line twist....   dont give up fishing ....but maybe lawn darts could become a primary sport...lol..."
668294,davey buoy,2012-02-20 22:14:00,5505, Always use a swivel and reduce line twist Dave.
668295,Dave Bailey,2012-02-20 22:19:00,1641," Have for about 50 years, thought he might have been saying I shouldn't."
668296,Dave Bailey,2012-02-20 22:22:00,1641, I always keep the drag tightened right up until the action starts.
