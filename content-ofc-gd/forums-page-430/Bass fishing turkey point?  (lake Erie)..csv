You'll have unlimited (thousands of acres) of water to fish for largies inshore in the canal and cattails and bullrushes and out on the sandbars for smallies.  I grew up fishing it, and it's still phenomenal today."

The top water bite on this side of the lake for largemouth generally sucks.  Wind direction plays a role on this side, summer winds, usually from the south - southwest pushes water out of the bays dropping the water levels and making the fish move to deeper water. They may hold on any deeper channel with a rip-rap wall. On your side a south - south west wind might help?  It is unusual to catch smallies here in the back bays after the middle of May except occasionally at night. A main lake thing after mid may, tubes, drop shot, blade baits, and here you need 20 - 30 pounds of smallies for a chance.  If you have`t been there? Pre-fish and try to get an idea of what might work and where to try."
