372021,bigugli,2009-08-12 16:20:00,6138,"Wonderful adventure there guys.  Just goes to show that doing the homework, and leg work pays off.  Half of the adventure is in the planning and getting there. The other half is the success that comes from the effort."
372052,diggyj,2009-08-12 18:23:00,548,"Looks like a great time was had by all. Some huge EYES, congrats to all of you. Cheers.  Dirk"
372068,Tom McCutcheon,2009-08-12 19:41:00,627,What an adventure!!!! Reminds me a little of a trip I did back in the late 80's. Lots of numbers of walleye mixed in with some large northerns. One of the highlights was a day trip drifting a river for large specks.  Enjoyed the read and pictures immensely  Tom.
372081,Musky or Specks,2009-08-12 20:08:00,2710,Sounds like a good trip if you like walleye fishing. By the way can you PM all your secret Brook Trout spots LOL

667749,solopaddler,2012-02-18 21:43:00,8605,  Glad you enjoyed it Connie. Can't believe you dredged it up though LOL!
667766,pikehunters,2012-02-19 00:14:00,40,  Call it an old post but a good one. For me thanks for dredging it up keeps the blood flowing & i'm sure looking at it was like it happend last week for ya.  What a trip!!!
667911,spud7378,2012-02-19 18:57:00,68,wow what an awesome trip thats a trip of a life time!!!
667923,BillM,2012-02-19 19:24:00,17367,"Yup, what a trip that was!"

I've been on a couple trips like that in North Westen Ontario myself, so I know the feeling. Now where was that lake again?...LOL don't expect a reply."
676310,Toronto_Angler,2012-03-15 02:57:00,698,Thanks for bumping this! What an awesome trip! Always been my dream to do a fly-in
676311,BillM,2012-03-15 02:59:00,17367,Seems like ages ago!  lol
676312,asdve23rveavwa,2012-03-15 03:02:00,2690,"I missed this one too, guys.  Absolutely amazing.  The slogging into that back lake was repaid in spades!!!! The size and colouration of those eyes is breathtaking!!!!"
676341,Hooked,2012-03-15 05:37:00,891,"I missed this one too!  I remember I was gone away for 2 weeks when this was posted.  Glad I checked it out, that looked awesome to say the least.  Call it living vicariously through others or just simply enjoying the read and pics, it's all good regardless even if it's almost a 3 year old post.  Man that looked like fun."

676376,Toronto_Angler,2012-03-15 13:52:00,698, Of course I'm interested! Yours and moosebunks reports are my favorites on here..Like reading a magazine lol
676548,lookinforwalleye,2012-03-15 23:34:00,4399,"Don`t know how I missed that report originally must have been away somewhere. Awesome trip I hope to do another fly-in again, after the Richter one this past year I would love to do another!!!"

371161,trapshooter,2009-08-10 10:29:00,1234,I enjoyed reading that very much Mike.  Amazing report - Amazing trip!!  The 'blue' walleye are more common then most would think.  We've got them up here as well.  I have heard the sun screen theory too.

371190,blaque,2009-08-10 12:51:00,2419,"I envy your lifestyle guys...........it would be nice to have a network of guys that actually ""does"" instead of just talks about doing lol. I need to find friends like you guys!"
371196,Headhunter,2009-08-10 13:08:00,5703,"Thanks for the great read! That's the kind of fly in I'd be lookin to do! Awesome and epic! Thanks, HH"
371210,blaque,2009-08-10 14:14:00,2419,"i may have missed it, but was their an outpost cabin at the backlake you trekked to? Or did you bring tent gear with as you portaged to the back lake. I dunno if i woulda given up the cabin on the main lake for 5 days lol  Ok, i went thru and looked at your pics again, yeah.......id give up the cabin, oh and the shower LOL"
371212,blaque,2009-08-10 14:19:00,2419," Its ""Lake of a million walleye"" ....silly"
371214,solopaddler,2009-08-10 14:21:00,8605, No the back lake had no cabin. We stayed on our lake and travelled back and forth each day. Not as bad as it sounds as we left the 2 boats and motors in there for the duration of the trip only dragging them back out on the last day we fished. We had a 3rd boat that we walked back to each day to get us back to the cabin....  Thanks again everyone! I think I should be a travel agent. I've fielded quite a few private inquiries LOL!
371220,ehg,2009-08-10 14:39:00,2666,"Seems like wherever you go and whatever fishes you catch, somehow gets turned into an epic report. Looks like a great time was had and tons of fish were caught. Nice fishing report again!"
371307,setomonkey,2009-08-10 19:41:00,872,Awesome report! I'm not surprised you are getting so many PMs about it!  Mike
371333,blaque,2009-08-10 20:18:00,2419," Oh im sure your inbox is maxed out at all times lol  Im not shy, ill ask you in front of everyone.......CAN I COME NEXT TIME!!!"
371530,solopaddler,2009-08-11 10:55:00,8605, Check your pm's bud.
371597,The Birdfish,2009-08-11 14:21:00,73,"Wow, what a trip!!  What lake/outfitter did you use??"
371762,T-Bone,2009-08-11 22:54:00,160,"Okay...I'll guess I'll try...seeing that four or so before me have failed.  What lake / what outfitter?  It's not like everyone is going to spend the big money (or even can) to head way north on a fly-in and spoil the location.  I read a lot on this board, and the tight-lipped non-disclosure of ""where"" on most posts always makes me laugh...  What? Is it some kind of taboo to ask? A breach of etiquette?"
371767,solopaddler,2009-08-11 23:09:00,8605," As a matter of fact yes.  If I had wanted to post the location publicly for the entire world to see I would have. Is it too hard to understand that I might possibly want to go back there one day? Is too hard to understand that a lake like that is vulnerable and can be fished down?  FYI I have fielded numerous pm's asking me the same questions you have. The vast majority I've supplied with the info, some I have not."
371770,Radnine,2009-08-11 23:17:00,1538,Congratulations on a trip that many of us can only dream about. Nothing short of inspirational. Jim
371798,wallacio,2009-08-12 00:10:00,475," Gee Mike, I didn't realize that we visited the ONLY lake in Northern Ontario that holds Walleye and Pike!"
371803,solopaddler,2009-08-12 00:15:00,8605,"   C'mon though, you know as well as I do average size like that is pretty rare. I've never seen anything like it on a small inland lake..."
371832,wallacio,2009-08-12 01:02:00,475," For sure, no argument there but in the age of internet reports etc, way too many people are looking to be spoon fed.    Where's the sense of adventure?"
371837,solopaddler,2009-08-12 01:15:00,8605," True.  What many don't understand is you rarely just ""stumble"" onto this kind of fishing blindly. I did a huge amount of research beforehand: phone calls, emails, checking references, talking to mnr biologists, pouring over maps and satellite images, etc., etc., etc... Nothing was taken on chance. I pretty much knew beforehand the fishing would be good..  This is the same research I've done for every trip of substance I've ever done. I've actually got an entire filing cabinet at home with info I've collected on hundreds of locations over the years.  That's the entire key to success right there."
371863,Whitespinnerbait,2009-08-12 01:51:00,2038,Walleye Report and More right there....
371875,curlrap,2009-08-12 02:08:00,58,"Just curious, how much does a fly in  trip like that cost?"
371877,solopaddler,2009-08-12 02:15:00,8605," $600 give or take, a bit more for a full week."
371878,curlrap,2009-08-12 02:20:00,58,Worth every penny!!!
371883,BassMan11,2009-08-12 02:35:00,583,"Really only that much? After reading your post i decided to do my own research on possible outposts. The majority of them are close to or over $800-$900... for the week. I would love to ""stumble"" onto a lake like that one day. Great post."
371966,blaque,2009-08-12 13:14:00,2419, Good Point............so theres no reason to know where it is
370847,icefisherman,2009-08-09 04:56:00,952,"Waoo this sure was the mother of all reports, not to mention my favorite fish every which way....can't complain....total viewing pleasure i thank you for.  Now.....how can I get some specific info about that place from you? Going to an inland lake full of walleye has been on my to do list for a while....don't think any other lake can eget even close to the one you were on. So I'd appreciate any specific info.....location/cost etc. Maybe we can exchange few PM's on the subject?  Cheers, Ice Fisherman"
370849,oates,2009-08-09 06:34:00,151,"Wow  I was thinking 'wheres the bass' then it clicked, no bass that far north. Simply beautiful. When one looks at a map of Northern Ontario, there are literally 100's of lakes, that's why the Americans rank Ontario fishing so high, I guess we are spoiled that way, imagine living in Nevada and wanting to go fishing. Makes the long cold winters worth it doesn't it, when you have trips like this to look forward to.  Great report - like fishing 500 years ago."
370850,SlowPoke,2009-08-09 06:35:00,2984,"I have been fortunate enough to enjoy a few trips like that. Now, it's off to bed so I can enjoy another one!"
370874,pikehunter,2009-08-09 12:57:00,1659,"INCREDIBLE!  You should consider yourself   one of the lucky individuals to have had the opportunity to experience such a great fishing trip, truly a trip of a lifetime for many of us.   Thanks for sharing your adventure."
370877,Terry,2009-08-09 13:07:00,14456,"wow, now that's a report  I hope to do a fly-in next summer I can only hope I find a place that great"
370878,Spiel,2009-08-09 13:22:00,9065,Insane!  I guess dropping in on you last week would have been pointless.
370897,Paully,2009-08-09 14:30:00,712,Truly awsome!!  I can only dream of fishing such places...
370908,BillM,2009-08-09 15:49:00,17367,"The main lake we stayed on most likely would have yielded decent results if we put more then one day on it, but the back lake just had everything going for it, depth, structure, etc etc...  We only got a few mins of heavy downpour but the wind was our enemy most of the week, except for the last day.  It got so bad one day that we couldn't back troll, 3' whitecaps and gusts at least in the 60km/h range made things interesting for sure.  I'd do it again in a heartbeat..  Great company, great fishing and laughs the entire week."
370981,danbouck,2009-08-09 20:09:00,4380,Amazing report as usual!
370983,tbayboy,2009-08-09 20:11:00,1497,Now that was a nice way to spend a lousy sunday afternoon - reading a great report.  Sounds like a great time guys and thanks for the awesome writeup and pics.
370986,redneck666,2009-08-09 20:36:00,563,great report! but the blue tinge on some of them 'eyes makes me wonder....
370991,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2009-08-09 20:59:00,0,incredible report.
370996,cram,2009-08-09 21:25:00,1733,Many believe the blue tinge in some walleye is a pigment that acts like a sunscreen.   Seems odd because the ones i have caught tend to come from deeper water.....but then there are people a lot smarter than me who seem to believe in it.
371004,bigcreekdad,2009-08-09 21:45:00,546,Fantastic Pics and report!!!
371033,Wendel,2009-08-09 23:10:00,213,wow... I'll just leave it at that... that would be the trip of a life time for us...  one thing missing... I thought... BEER lol
371039,solopaddler,2009-08-09 23:22:00,8605,  Ummmm...nope. Why do you think we chartered the Otter for the flight in? LOL!  Thanks for the comments everyone!
371041,danbouck,2009-08-09 23:31:00,4380, nope... I'm pretty sure there was a coors in the one pic of Bill
371044,Stern Rules,2009-08-09 23:50:00,342,How do you manage to get all those pics on here? There's a 250k limit and I have to shrink my pics down and I only manage to get around 12 or so. How do you do it?
371053,solopaddler,2009-08-10 00:30:00,8605, Use a hosting site. The most common and the one I use is photobucket....
371062,mikeh,2009-08-10 01:01:00,824,Amazing post and a trip of a lifetime for some people.
371065,Stern Rules,2009-08-10 01:06:00,342, Thanks. I'll have to try that.

370705,solopaddler,2009-08-08 22:19:00,8605,"We had arrived at the airbase with our spirits running high. Enroute we'd seen a bit of wildlife which was cool and a sure sign we were getting further north.        For myself it was the 29th fly in I've done over the years. Old hat you'd think, but the prospect of lots of fish and a lake all to yourself never gets tired. Dave and Jeremy had flown in the bush before as well, but not to an outpost camp. This was a first for Bill and his excitement was contagious.  We quickly unloaded our gear on the dock at the float plane base:     Then Bill took a few moments to sort through his selection of pike lures.  ""What'ya think guys?""    After a bit of a wait we quickly loaded the Otter and were off:      As usual the view from the air was amazing:            Although unfinished and a bit basic our cabin was fairly new and served our purposes perfectly: A place to crash after fishing hard all day long:        One major bonus was an outdoor shower complete with hot and cold running water. Pure luxury after a long day in the boat!        After unloading the plane the pilot quickly walked us through what we needed to know and left us to our own devices:    Alone on a fish filled lake for the next 5 days, does it get any better?  We quickly unpacked, rigged up our rods and got the boats ready. We had flown in late in the afternoon and had just enough time for a quick fish before nightfall.  We all piled into two boats and were off making a beeline for a small island right across from our camp. One rod rigged with a crankbait to troll as we prospected the lake, another rod rigged with a jig to be used when we found the fish...  It didn't take long to get into fish.                  Jeremy managed the largest eye our first evening a long skinny 26""er:    What a fantastic start! While overall they weren't huge fish we caught a ridiculous amount in a short period of time and kept a limit of 4 for sandwiches the next day.    The next day dawned cloudy, warm and calm, perfect for fishing.     There was an adjacent back lake that we all had our eyes on, but today we'd planned on working our lake thouroughly. The action picked up right where we left off the previous evening. Non stop action on smallish to med sized walleyes and hammer handle pike. At one point Dave actually did hook an enormous pike while jigging for walleye. It eventually smoked him and he never did see it but it was huge... We caught fish every which way possible: trolling harnesses and cranks, live bait rigs, drifting and backtrolling with jigs....it all worked.              This time we kept a few for dinner with Dave doing the slicing and dicing:    Now as mentioned there was a nearby back lake that had us intrigued. The fishing was fine on our lake but the allure of near virgin water and a lust for exploration proved irresistable. The 2 lakes were connected by a swampy log choked creek and the next day we began our ascent into the unknown:        Things were going swimmingly up to this point. We had traversed one low beaver dam with zero difficulty and then things started to get tougher....      Very soon we were faced with this   :    I'm not going to sugar coat it....it was tough slogging! It took all 4 of us to push, pull and drag one boat at a time up and over an enourmous log jam and through a shallow rock garden with almost no water flow..          Finally success! The creek opened up again and we were able to navigate under power.    The creek opened out into one of the nicest little lakes I've ever seen. A shoreline ringed with rock, it was extremely deep for its size, structure filled and crystal clear.    Initially we began our assault at the south end of the lake. A small creek entered here followed by the only shallow weedy flat in the entire lake. Casting a variety of spoons we caught a bunch of small pike:        With the depth of the lake we began to troll the rocky shoreline picking up a fish here and there finally ending up in a huge bay at the north end. The wind was piling into it dead on...a definite walleye chop. Bill started the festivities banging several in row on a yellow 5 of diamonds spoon. The fish were definitely aggressive!          I finally managed to get one, a decent little eye:    Then followed that up with this hog on the jig. Felt like I set the hook on a finned bowling ball with this one!    What was amazing about these walleyes besides their size and numbers was their colouration. They had normal gold body colours but all of their fins were tinged with a bright blue hue. Not sure if you can see it, but I tried to take a couple of closeups:       The balance of the day was possibly one of the best walleye days I've ever had. It was impossible to keep count they were too numerous.  Continued...."
370707,solopaddler,2009-08-08 22:21:00,8605,"The enslaught continued unabated. In between walleye Dave managed this larger than average sized esox. (Can you tell he's happy?  )    Without trying to get overly redundant here's a few more highlights from our remarkable day:                          We had numerous doubles.  Some were more average sized...    Some, well some were ummm... a bit bigger.           I was handling so many fish my hands started to cramp up. This one ended up in Bills lap LOL!            What can I say except it was totally EPIC!   We arrived back at camp super late that day, probably around 9pm, tired but elated.  Jeremy, young and full of energy treated us all to a late night fish fry. Having guided in northwestern Ontario the lad has done this before and it was like watching a maestro at work.          Actually he treated everyone except Billy. Billy as some of you know is allergic to fish.  Here's my dinner next to Bills:    After our incredible day in the back lake we had no desire to fish anywhere else and the next 2 days were almost carbon copies of the first.  I started things off with another monster:      And of course the release....    Once again Davey fluked off another decent pike:    At one point I needed to stretch and asked Bill to drop me off an a small island. Not surprisingly I picked off a bunch on foot:      It really was non stop insanity:             At one point Bill hooked a decent 'eye and as is often the case a large pike chased his fish down and grabbed it.  We almost managed to net both, but the big pike finally let go just as we dipped the net:      Not long afterwards Bill managed a brute walleye of his own. 30 3/4"" long (might as well call it 31"" LOL!). (Yes he was a happy camper.  )         And the enslaught continued...               These fish would hit anything didn't matter what you threw.  Bill even managed one on an oversized Grandma: (And I mean the lure not the family member  )     Our last day on the lake we once again fished late, getting in as much as we could before the plane picked us up the next morning. We were cut, beat up, tired and sore and couldn't have been happier!  It was a perfect evening as we motored back across the lake our fishing over..    We were all in a happy daze. Jeremy was at the tiller of the 2nd boat cruising along when suddenly he jumps up and yells incoherently:     Yeah baby what a trip!"

370763,Rich Clemens,2009-08-09 01:04:00,3131,One heck of a great report and all in just 5 days.   Thoroughly enjoyed it.
370766,scuro2,2009-08-09 01:10:00,904,"Great trip but hey, where did you go? I loved the blue fins, I'd go just for that."
370771,wallyboss,2009-08-09 01:16:00,1095,What a fishing vacation that was!!!!!! Thanks for sharing those awesome pictures
370777,wallacio,2009-08-09 01:22:00,475, The bugs weren't too bad on the portage - though the mosquitoes back at camp at dusk were brutal.   BBQ'ing or cleaning fish at that time of day was not fun.    The worst thing about the portage was the treacherous footing in the creek while pulling the boat and lugging gear - it's a wonder that none of us rolled an ankle.    Mike and I commented that it would have been nice to have our wading boots along for better traction.
370780,Billy Bob,2009-08-09 01:24:00,5865,It don't get no better than that.......  :worthy:
370787,BillM,2009-08-09 01:40:00,17367," I thought I was going to break an ankle wearing those boots without the inserts...  Crazy....  Definitely a treacherous walk, although jumping the logs was the best part"
370801,solopaddler,2009-08-09 02:25:00,8605," You're right about the next one bud, are you in or what? And yeah work has been tough this week....great trip!     Yeah it was trecherous for everyone except Jeremy. I honestly don't know how the lad did it. He skipped through that rock garden like a leprechaun through a rose garden with the motor over his shoulder LOL!  (Getting old sucks!  )   Thanks for all the great comments everyone, glad you enjoyed!"
370827,Joey,2009-08-09 03:27:00,9122,Well that sure looks like one helluva trip.  Really great pics and I can see the blue tinge on the pickerel.  Very cool.  Joey
370838,okumasheffield,2009-08-09 04:12:00,318,Carrying boats like that?  That is a real hardcore fishing trip!
