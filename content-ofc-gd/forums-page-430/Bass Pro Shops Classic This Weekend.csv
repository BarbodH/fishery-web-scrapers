I am getting my gear ready for a seminar for both Saturday and Sunday, and there are other great seminars from other anglers as well.  I can't believe the deal on the 4 Stroke Mercury 9.9hp engine. Unreal. I am thinking of upgrading my 4hp 4 stroke to the 9.9 at that price! There are also great deals on stickbaits and goodies as well.  Hope to see you there!  Aaron"

I got a hold of a Core online and want to match it up with something uber light, All my casting outfits are fairly heavy so I was thinking of a light crankbait Loomis maybe even an NRX??   What would you match it with?"
