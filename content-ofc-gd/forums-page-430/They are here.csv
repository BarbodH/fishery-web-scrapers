675694,Ron,2012-03-13 18:02:00,1683,"Great to see Jason,  Too bad that LOMU and the MNR don't deem it necessary to collect data this year. The data shows this should be a record year once again in quantity. I sure do hope they know what they are doing.  Cheers, Ron..."
675703,esoxansteel,2012-03-13 18:15:00,1307,"That was the last of the steelhead to run the Ganaraska River, time to move to other tribs, theres no more fish to come  "
675713,misfish,2012-03-13 18:35:00,29133,TFS  I always wondered how many knock them selves out  hit that concrete.
675721,chessy,2012-03-13 18:44:00,610, Hey Ron have I got a story to tell you ... i am going after a scientific permit ... and some people don' t like that . Hope to see you at the river and tell you. I know you know alot about the lomu but what i tell you will make you spit fire
675724,FrankTheRabbit,2012-03-13 18:49:00,479,"hah, that's  hilarious. The fish who jump up and hit the concrete slab. lol"
675751,torco,2012-03-13 19:36:00,656,Its kind of shame to see the fish struggle to get past that dam.
675755,davey buoy,2012-03-13 19:48:00,5505,"Not a very good set up,is it because there is a stream of water running down the concrete which is making them think they can get through?.If they could just slow the flow of the opening a tad,much more would make it IMO. I also can't remember them hitting a dry wall head first:whistling:"
675761,chessy,2012-03-13 20:08:00,610, engineers at work... the water normally does not go down that channel.. the engineers made it to low and if we get any high water at all thats where the fish go due to rainbows don't like heavy water flow.. but its not in the volunteers control or we would sand bag that side. but we are not allowed
675861,Paulus,2012-03-14 00:20:00,522,"Allow me to add to the delirium  - here are a couple I picked up with my new toy this afternoon. I knew this morning that I should've gone out with something other than a camera, but that's the way the marital ball bounces!        cheers, p.-"

676248,esoxansteel,2012-03-15 00:27:00,1307,"Just got back from the Ganny, steelhead still going through the ladder, but increased water flow over the dam, is causing them to jump right across the dam, and slowing the process, there is a pile of fish below the ladder, and some real tanks to boot. If the water flow subsides over the dam, they will home in on the out flow of the ladder, and then they will move through unubstructed very quickly if water temps hold. Very interested to see the final numbers through the counter at Corbetts."
676293,chessy,2012-03-15 02:28:00,610, no sense even having the counter in .. when they make numbers up......... lets say 4900 thorough the counter... they say ...... 9250 ..... yup that sounds right
