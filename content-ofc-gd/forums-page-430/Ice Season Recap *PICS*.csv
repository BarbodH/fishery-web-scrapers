It was a very strange season with the weather and the main lake not freezing.  I made the decision to take the winter off of guiding and I guess it was the best year to do it.  Keys this year were fishing deeper than usual (108-125) and staying mobile and away from the inevitable crowds. Best success came on X-Zone Swammers and tubes.  Enjoy the pics!!              Thanks for reading!"
