676358,Nipfisher,2012-03-15 12:40:00,2449,  Would have been easier for the ladies to boat it if they knew how to work a ratchet strap. It was wound too much to start with and was binding.
676365,Fang,2012-03-15 12:53:00,1330,"When RJ and JP made their first appearance I kept getting this deja vu feeling I'd seen him before  He's a 4 time world champion arm wrestler and on an episode last year they had him in a bar for a match.  Nipfisher, you caught that too!! It's starting to be a little to much like Survivor for me. Snipers, really bad editing where the gator they catch is not the gator in the fight scenes. I'm sure I saw the same clip of a gator coming off the bottom of the river at different points in the show   Sure looks like Hollywood has taken over the show and it's loosing it's charm.  I still like that most of them use guns that look like they came out of my grandad's barn"
