676174,jedimaster,2012-03-14 19:53:00,3472,As I think I mentioned I had a conversation with an MP about it in person. I did not read any such manifesto. He was fairly open that there was going to be a review and possible changes to the Fisheries Act.
676177,jedimaster,2012-03-14 19:58:00,3472,"To be honest, I personally feel like environmental conserns are best left up to the provinces versus the feds. The provinces have such uniqueness in terms of environment that they are better equipt to make wise decisions. As it is now a single piece of legislation affects all of canada. What is good fo BC may not be what is good for Ontario and vice versa."

I am not excusing what he did as not being wrong and he should be punished for breaking the rules but to compare sending out an anonymous message re-iterating your opponents very public view on abortion vs. redirecting voters to fake polling stations are mountains apart.   Its a tough slog to stop them from doing anything with that majority but I am all for giving it a try."
676046,muskymatt,2012-03-14 13:52:00,2608," Well, well Gerritt has some input, even though it has nothing to do with the topic! No input either subjective or objective, no positive contribution to the topic, which is not hockey, but as a Sens fan I'm smart enough to differentiate. Nope, nada, just insults and jabs, can't say I'm surprised though. Back on topic, if anyone is not concerned with Harpers direction with laws protecting the environment, you should be! This will ultimately open the door for  future assaults on not only the environment but the rights of anglerd and hunters as well. Up until now Canada has been a global leader in environmental protection, but in Harpers endless pursuit of cuddling up to American politics and dollars, it will change."
676047,bushart,2012-03-14 13:53:00,2628,  I don't know how to answer this??   Everybody knows we need oil currently----but it took Dr. David Schindler from the U of Alta to prove that letting the oil industry monitor itself is a bad idea  there was an untruth floating around that pollutants in the Athabsca river were naturally occuring---till Dr. Schindler proved them wrong----now suddenly there's 3rd party monitoring and then environment minister John Baird had to eat some crow.  You see they will not install whatever pollution controls needed to stop what's ending up in that river and poisoning the lives downstream and that huge lake.
676049,bushart,2012-03-14 13:57:00,2628,Uhh---I'm not a mod guys---just tryin to not get this important topic into lockdown  sooo--if we can not jab shots may be cool
676052,Rod Caster,2012-03-14 14:07:00,5784,"http://www.wbea.org/  This is who I worked for. Lots of good reading, data reviewing, projects to go through here.  WBEA are basically an ""independant"" group that is funded by governement, industry and other local groups. They monitored the area quite thoroughly in my opinion, within their mandate. The problem is, you can have 1000 pages of PROOF of contamination and the government has little to no resources, power, want, historical supporting data or public support to do anything about it. There are 1000 other pages that will contradict the proof...lobyists, sceptics, bad science, good science...  and as soon as the governement jumps in, usually late, people say ""oh, they are doing it wrong and wasting taxpayer money"". And the hamster runs, and the hamster runs.  There's no clear direction when it comes to the environmental direction in Canada. We should be looking to California for ideas...we are at least 20 years behind the US in terms of research, legislation, green industry etc... not all of the US, of course, but overall we are way behind and this leaves a lot of room for decisions based on bad/no science.  I'm sure this is an incomplete thought.... but i'm not writing an essay here."
676058,bushart,2012-03-14 14:19:00,2628,All valid points RC  I believe what the final nail was-----pollutants do not naturally occur on top of snow  and levels they found within a 50 km radius of the oilsands was equivelant to an oil tanker wreck spewing into the Athabaca river during runoff  I look at it this way---one would have to take the federal Cons---the Alta Cons and the oil industry kicking and screaming into that 3rd party monitoring if they could prove it naturally occuring  thus the change IMO
676061,jedimaster,2012-03-14 14:26:00,3472,SOunds to me like it will be easier to build a dock or alter the shoreline. Some of the rules in place are stupid beyond a doubt. Just try getting a permit to put down some stones to protect a shoreline from eroding.

676100,jedimaster,2012-03-14 16:48:00,3472,"You can't have one without the other. The economy needs to be strong in order to provide the resources to protect the environment from the very thing that goes to help raise funds. There are ways to protect yet allow development. Certain pieces of legislation are so outdated that they in fact block things from happening that would actually help... case in point allowing sand bags in streams to divert water or fish from being stuck in damns.  Some streamlining is clearly needed to make improvements. Thats what a governments job is. To improve on what they have been given. Now weather or not this is an improvement is up to each person to decide. I am not entirely opposed to the idea of revamping the fisheries act. Do you know how many conversations like the following have occured ""Logically you know that this would not only help the environment but provide a boost to the economy...Sorry sir its not allowed""  There are always agendas hidden on every side. I would suggest people go through the information before blindly passing judgement on something. Once you have feel free. Well feel free even if you are illinformed."
676103,bushart,2012-03-14 16:59:00,2628,Well on that note--I have become informed  and once you do become informed is the point it gets scary   and Re: Criticizing politicians---good luck with that---you may be unhappy but they are given a 4-5 year lease to work their agenda  and all the complaining won't change that  Now votes----that tells them if your happy or dis-satisfied with their performance.  Me---I liken it to---ice fisherman going out on open ended ice on Simcoe and then asking why after the fact----maybe they should get informed on the possible results  so the same in the election---I got informed and voted the best way I thought---I may have lost  But my research is proving true.
676104,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2012-03-14 17:09:00,0," i would suggest you might benefit from following your own advice  as I doubt you are more informed than myself.  As cocky as that may sound, it was my profession for better part of the last decade.  instead of making vague and uninformative posts like this one, perhaps you could enlighten us as to what is out of date about the fisheries act other than it makes things difficult for an oil pipeline?"
676105,limeyangler,2012-03-14 17:11:00,5204,"  An american would recognise it....its the same Bull ideology of the neo-con GOP, deregulate everything, then when it goes kaboom, blame everyone else and tax us more, and if you protest call you unpatriotic and claim you weren't born  there....so much for small government."

676112,jedimaster,2012-03-14 17:44:00,3472," Did I suggest anything in my post that I was referring to you? I am fairly well informed of the fisheries act. So without the risk of sounding like an ignorant cocky   like you, perhaps you should sit back and ponder at what the meaning behind the post was. That was for people to not just blindly trust what any media outlet gives on any pollitical issue as they all have anagenda. Good or bad there is always an agenda. Look up the information for yourself and base your judgement on that.  If you took that as a slight against you then perhaps you should bite your own toungue before making such a ridiculas comment like the one you made pointed at me."

I'm just more than a lttle Po'd on the roughshod ride that's going on---and just a bit ticked to type  You decide??...From Today's Vancouver Sun..   OTTAWA - The Harper government did not challenge Tuesday opposition allegations that it is poised to “gut” legislation that has been a key tool for decades in forcing industrial and natural resource projects to go through environmental reviews.  “There has been absolutely no decision made with regard to this issue,” Fisheries Minister Keith Ashfield told the House of Commons when confronted with the allegations of a former federal fisheries biologist.  Ashfield’s office later released a statement reiterating that no decision has been made but that changes are needed. “Federal fisheries policies designed to protect fish are outdated and unfocused in terms of balancing environmental and economic realities.”  Former bureaucrat Otto Langer made public Monday proposed wording changes in the federal Fisheries Act that he said would make it easier for projects like Calgary-based Enbridge Inc.’s Northern Gateway pipeline to B.C. to clear federal hurdles.  Langer, who worked for the federal government for 32 years, said he was told the change would be included in upcoming federal omnibus legislation following the March 29 budget.  The changes would prohibit activity that would cause an “adverse effect” on “fish of economic, cultural or ecological value.”  The law currently bans activity that results in the harmful alteration, disruption or destruction of fish habitat.  The New Democratic Party leaped on the issue, accusing the government of engineering a major reversal in environmental policy.  “The Conservative government is systematically dismantling environmental protection and regulation,” NDP fisheries critic Fin Donnelly said.  “By eliminating provisions to protect fish habitat, they can push through their agenda of pipelines, oil super tankers, mega-mines and other projects that harm the environment.”  In question period, Donnelly asked if the government had a plan to “gut” the legislation, prompting Ashfield’s response that a decision on amending the act hadn’t been made.  “I will note that Canada is blessed with an abundant array of natural resources of which we should be proud and which we take seriously and responsibly to conserve and protect,” Ashfield added.  The new wording leaked to Langer includes numerous exemptions to give the minister “or a person prescribed by the regulations” the authority to permit activities that would have an “adverse effect” on fish considered of value.  The changes, if enacted, would result in the total rewriting of the legislation to remove habitat protection provisions that have been in place since 1976, said Langer, who worked for the David Suzuki Foundation after leaving the federal government but is now retired.  Langer pointed out that the Enbridge pipeline would cross hundreds of rivers and streams, so looser federal legislation would be a major break for the Calgary company.  Langer said the “subjective and ambiguous” new wording would make the law extremely difficult to enforce.  “For instance, what is a fish of economic, cultural or ecological value?” he asked.  An intense behind-the-scenes lobbying battle has been waged over the Fisheries Act’s habitat provisions, especially in Alberta and B.C.  More than three dozen industry and environmental groups registered as lobbyists in Ottawa have raised concerns about the issue, according to the lobbyist registry.  “Some of the largest and most complex natural resource and industrial development projects across the country are affected by Fisheries Act requirements, which are consistently identified as one of the top federal regulatory irritants by stakeholders across the country,” says a 2011 briefing note prepared for Ashfield.  The briefing note, obtained by Postmedia News through the Access to Information Act, said the legislation’s habitat protection provisions are “one of the most frequent triggers” of federal assessments under the Canadian Environmental Assessment Act.  An assessment act review “can occur for a project of any size, and across many sectors of the economy,” such as construction, urban development, agriculture, nature resource development.  The briefing note said there’s a “strong contingent” of environmental groups advocating in favour of protecting fish habitat, while industry groups are advocating their own economic interests.  “As minister you will be required to manage these often competing interests in order to balance protection of fish and fish habitat resources with other social, environmental and economic objectives of importance.”  Among the corporate lobbyists raising concerns about the Fisheries Act are the Canadian Association of Petroleum Producers, the Business Council of B.C., the Canadian Electricity Association, the Canadian Hydropower Association, EnCana Corp., Teck Resources Ltd., The Mining Association of Canada, the Canadian Energy Pipeline Association, the Council of Forest Industries, and the Saskatchewan Power Corp.  Environmentalist and social activist groups include the David Suzuki Foundation, Ecojustice Canada, the World Wildlife Fund Canada, MiningWatch Canada, the Pembina Institute, and Environmental Defence Canada.  Former auditor general Sheila Fraser, in a 2009 report, said protecting fish habitat is important “not only for fish, but also for human health and recreational use. Healthy habitat—places where fish can spawn, feed, grow, and live—is a fundamental requirement for sustaining fish, providing food and shelter for aquatic and terrestrial wildlife, and contributing to water quality for human consumption and other uses.”  A senior official with the Council of Forest Industries, one of the industry associations which has lobbied on the Fisheries Act, refused to say whether the current wording is an irritant.  “There’s no question in our mind that many pieces of legislation, including the fisheries legislation, could be made more efficient from an administrative point of view, and therefore lower our operating costs and improve our competitiveness without compromising the conservation goals and objectives of the legislation,” said Doug Routledge, the organization’s vice-president of forestry.
