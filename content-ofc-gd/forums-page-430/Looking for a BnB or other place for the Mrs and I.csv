Any idea's close (2 hour drive time) from Whitby?  We have been to the Niagara area before and no need to go back so any ideas are welcome, cheers.  Geoff"
676325,irishfield,2012-03-15 03:23:00,26272,I'd drive futher than 2 hours for a ........ .. Just sayin...
676328,bigugli,2012-03-15 03:26:00,6138,One possibility http://www.bbcanada.com/associations/stjacobs/
676332,Dave Bailey,2012-03-15 03:38:00,1641,"You might want to try the Prince Edward County area, there are a number of places. Some of the wineries in the county have accommodations and restaurants. The county tourism web site seems to be down at the moment, I couldn't get it to open."
676337,fishnsled,2012-03-15 04:07:00,3520,"One of my favourite places to go, although more then the 2 hours you are looking at. Bob and Peg are terrific hosts. Down fall is you are a bit of a drive to anything for dinner. Sudbury gives you some choices but you cannot beat ""The Bus"" in Killarney for fish and chips.  Whispering Pines On The Bay   Here's my report from a few years ago. (Woodgrange B&B doesn't have a listing anymore, maybe just closed for the winter )  Report    Of course you can search BBCanada . Been using that site for years and must have stayed in 30+ B&B's over the years, never had a bad experience.  Another one that is a bit closer to your 2 hour range is Inks Spot B&B in Huntsville.  Family weekend fun a couple of years ago Report  Any questions, fire away."
676342,JustinHoffman,2012-03-15 07:22:00,482,"Hey Geoff,  OOD Magazine had a writer's retreat two falls ago at Elmhirst Resort - on the shores of Rice Lake. Your own cottage on the water, wonderful restaurant, acres of hiking trails and rolling hills, horseback riding, a spa...plus, all the fishing you want.  I had a great experience - thought I'd pass the recommendation on.  http://www.elmhirst.ca  Cheers,  Justin"
676350,mercman,2012-03-15 11:35:00,7054,  If all the girls lived in the sky.....Wayne would surely learn to fly........... Wait.....he already knows how to fly.  Carry on then
676399,Gerritt,2012-03-15 15:37:00,6129,"Less then 2 hours away... but check this place out Geoff...   the wife will love it! trust me, and you can fish as well  http://www.thecranberryresort.com/   G."

676641,ADB,2012-03-16 03:11:00,444,"Langdon Hall in Cambridge.  Their continental breakfast is ridiculous and their restaurant has been rated as one of the best in the World.  Beautiful property with gardens and trails.  Right near the Grand too.  Fishing for you, and they have a spa for the wife as well.  http://www.langdonhall.ca/index.htm"
676872,GBW,2012-03-16 21:52:00,8460,"Well, an update for you all...  She picked Elmhirst based on the web site and chat she had with someone there.  Thanks Justin! And thanks to all that offered ideas too!"
676878,irishfield,2012-03-16 22:07:00,26272,Maybe get your float rating while you're there... oh.. you need a pilot's licence first! lol Have fun...

676909,Wolf 3,2012-03-16 23:46:00,134, Elmhirst is a very nice resort. Now all you have to do is convince your wife to go May 12 so you can target walleye...
