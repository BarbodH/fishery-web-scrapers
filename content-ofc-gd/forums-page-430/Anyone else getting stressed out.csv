674521,whiskywizard,2012-03-09 14:38:00,305," That's so true Cliff.  I have the same 3 piles. They have different names, but it's the same 3 piles.  I call them Urgent, Important, and Urgent & Important. If something isn't important, consider not doing it. Ever.  Sometimes when I'm especially busy, only the Urgent & Important pile gets any attention.  And every once in a while I'll stop doing something, just to see if anybody notices or cares. Sometimes we think something is important, but it's not really. One day I'd like to figure out how everything my wife wants done is always both Urgent & Important."

It does work,at times.When you got 3 operators coming at you and saying they need this, and this is not working,it gets crazy.I was only there 10 hours today.LOL  I am working saturday,but sunday is a day off to think about this three pile format more. I am going to work hard at this 3 pile. I also need to walk away and not think this is only my problem.   Thanks again for listening to my vent and thanks again for your input.  Brian"

674725,crappieperchhunter,2012-03-10 01:43:00,2582, Three Piles you say...lol..sounds like a good system Cliff...but the LOL refers to a past experience of mine.  When I was working in our Mississauga Plant our very busy specialized department went from 5 people down to just 2 of us. It was far and away the most stressful work environment I have ever experienced in my life. Everyday as soon as you came in at 6:30...and sorted through the enormous pile of work orders..you knew a large portion of it had absolutely no chance of getting out the door in the promised time frame. It is absolutely no fun starting each day knowing that despite your very best efforts you are going to disappoint most of your customers. Then at around 9 the customer service reps started calling if they where offsite... or standing at your workstation demanding a revised timeframe so they could let the customer know. You spend a good chunk of your day dealing with THEM instead of doing your job. For a good 6 month stretch the phone ringing in our work area would actually give me a little panic attack. It was absolutely brutal.  We had a 2 pile system at the time.  Pile #1 was stuff that got escalated to that pile.  Pile#2 was stuff that didn't.  You never even looked at pile #2.

You seem like a guy that gives his all for the company, but they sure seem to be taking you for granted. It is very poor management on their part to let a man like you work so many hours and get to feeling this way. If they can't do without you for the week-end, what on earth will they do when you end up sick and have to stay off work for a month or more? Think about it!  Remember, you live where you do because you enjoy the outdoors and those Grand Babies of yours. Work is good and we all need money, but it ain't the most important thing in your life."

I took one issue at a time and dealt with it,then take a breather,and go to the next issue. I have to say,it seemed to be the ticket for me this week,but I know next week will be more challanges,and will have to remember to step back and breath.

Can honestly say, just in the past few months alone, a string of fatal ailments has plagued patients while I've been working.  Resuscitation attempts (for a hanging, a few MI's, a sepsis, couple OD's) returning life to some yet seeing some patients pass on as well, it has been a good feeling knowing that each time our team (and self) did all we could, and did it efficiently well.  That said, a few times in the past months working 60-76 hours a week has taken it's toll.  Years back I once suffered 3 colds/flus in a year, this year let alone it's been 3 in the past 3 months.  Day and night shifts all over the map and two hospitals I am no longer able to co-ordinate shifts with, I've decided to step back from one place and regain more control over hours worked, my time with the girls and of course, days on the water.

674343,Ralph Field,2012-03-09 00:11:00,1018,Somehow you have to work things out before you have a break down of some sort. Speak to your boss and tell him how you feel and that you can't keep working  the long hours that you are now working. It sounds as though what your doing is in high demand so if your boss won't help you out you may have to move to another shop. Best of luck!
674344,crappieperchhunter,2012-03-09 00:12:00,2582,It sounds like you made your own bed Brian.  I was on the same road 4-5 years ago. Then like a light switch something clicked in my head and I said to myself I will not do this silliness anymore.  If you wanna stop or cut down all you have to say to the boss is I'll do my fair share...but I physically can't take this pace anymore. If you are a good employee and have a decent boss that will be all it takes.  After I told my boss how I felt things didn't change immediately...but 4-5 years later he knows to ask the other lads first for overtime and they usually take it. So now when we are crazy busy I get 8-10 hours of overtime a week instead of 20+...and everyone is happier.  Learning how and when to say enough is enough is the best gift I ever gave myself.  The fish within 1-2 hours of my house however aren't real happy with me being at work less  Sucks to be them somedays  Edit..We are now talking to Victoria's Secrets to print magazines/catalogues..whatever.  I just might have to take some extra OT for that..you know...just to make extra sure our print quality is good

Right now we are so busy we are behind that it causes me stress figuring who to screw the least in terms of delivery.  Everybody wants everything in two/three weeks.  We are booked four weeks out.  In the end we take it and work evenings/weekends because you just never know when the work will dry up.  I am pretty sure you guys are faced with the scenario as me not being able to hire anybody.

Untrained, unexperienced temps to fill holes in budget cuts have ben the norm for years. You do what you can so that you can leave work and hold your head high and leave the rest to the powers that made this mess. People get ticked at the bad service and blame unions for making the mess. Before I get jumped on, there is something to be said about being grateful for the job tho and putting in the extra time/effort, (and I do despite my kids asking this very night why I can't be home more) Remember,  you will only be missed as long as it would take for the water to fill the whole if you pull your fist out of a bucket of water (did I get that saying right?).

674358,12footspringbok,2012-03-09 00:37:00,459,We've been rocking at my shop since August too. The thing is so many shops closed up 4 years ago that the few places left just can't handle the work right now. I'm in the position of running the machine that is the bottle neck at my work right now.  King salmon is right about no one wanting to do machining. A good apprentice is hard to come by and when we get one we can't pay them enough to keep them around. We get the odd temp but its like going backwards when you have to babysit someone all day. I'll take the extra work right now though. We did workshare for a year at my work that was waaaaay worse.  The amount of prototypes and quoting of parts we have been doing you guys on the production side should be busy for quite sometime.
674364,Kingsalmon,2012-03-09 00:44:00,107, I hope you're right.  But there a lot of crazy variables out there that can shut down the whole industry like it did four years ago.

674499,grimsbylander,2012-03-09 12:50:00,3016," It's the type of job that dictates if it's cheaper to bring guys in to help. If we get a now rare busy stretch, I can't bring in machinists and mold makers to help out. Regardless of how good they are, there is always an extended training period. They're working at 25% of their potential, mistakes are made and your ""go to guys"" are getting help up by them. The up side is sometimes you can find a gem but that doesnt solve the short term crisis. When you add all this up plus hiring costs and benefits, overtime is cheap...in the short term."
674502,bigugli,2012-03-09 13:10:00,6138,In the flower industry we had a 3 month rush for Easter and spring. The norm was 80-100 hr work weeks. It was taxing and stressful. It had health consequences.

The most important thing is to find a balance that works for you. If you continue to push yourself too hard you are going to end up sick which won't help you or the company. The biggest thing that I have found that helped me get through some of those situations was to prioratize. I make three piles; NOW, ASAP, and when/if I get a chance.  Everything that comes in goes to the bottom of the appropriate pile. If you manage to get through the NOW pile, the ASAP file becomes the now pile etc. Always start at the top of a pile and finish dealing with each item as you come to it."
