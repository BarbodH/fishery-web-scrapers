But they stay curled up when removed from the packages, does anyone have any tips on straightening them out and keeping them straight? Thanks."
675135,Sinker,2012-03-12 01:04:00,8692,"Tie them on your rod, hook the clip on your hook holder, and reel the line tight. Leave it there over night, and it will be straight, and will stay straight. One thing I love about fluoro leaders is they don't get kinks like steel.   S."
675277,express168,2012-03-12 15:35:00,327,"Makes sense, pretty simple eh."
675281,DRIFTER_016,2012-03-12 15:54:00,10439,Or if you don't want to wait around for your leader to straighten just pick up a Fly Fishing Leader Straightener

675514,Sinker,2012-03-13 02:15:00,8692,"I usually just give them a good hard pull/stretch to get them straight when new, but they last for so long, I haven't had to replace any since I got my first few leaders.  S."
675530,registerfly,2012-03-13 03:31:00,198,"just use a small piece of tire inner tube and pull through that. it's kinda like magic, just don't reef on it or it will heat up and snap off.  my inner fly fisher talking"
675546,Ron,2012-03-13 07:26:00,1683,"All great replys but each way to straighten are for different pound test leaders. If you are using 140lb leader for an example, 3oz of weight over night will not straighten it out. Streatching a 6lb leader will surely effect the leader strength.  What lb test are you referring to?"
675559,express168,2012-03-13 11:49:00,327," Sorry, I have 80lb leaders."
676279,Ron,2012-03-15 02:12:00,1683,"For 80 lb leaders you could lightly stretch them to easily straighten them out. What I do is use my closed needle nose pliers in one loop, stand on them with both feet and then use my jaw spreader wire in the other end and pull about 40 lbs worth of force. Hold it for just a second or 2 and see how it is. It's not often you have to stretch it the second time."
676305,Dabluz,2012-03-15 02:51:00,701,"You have to be really careful when it comes to stressing fluorocarbon.  If it gets over stressed, it does not rebound back like mono but remains damaged.  I'm interested in why such a large diameter line.  Does the lure still move from side to side with such a huge diameter line in front of it?  Is it to prevent a fish's teeth from cutting it?  If so, why not use a much smaller diameter wire leader?  Does the large diameter fluorocarbon send off vibrations when it is moving through the water?  I know that fish can sense very tiny differences in water pressure.....that's how they can stick so close together in schools even though the school can suddenly change directions.  Can you tie a knot in line so large?  Can your outfit (rod and reel) pull 80 lbs?  Is the line for the anchor?"
676307,Dabluz,2012-03-15 02:52:00,701, Steel don't get kinks if it's handled right.  I've used steel (monel) line and even copper line for many years and never had that problem.  I prefer steel line over lead core because you can get more depth without all the weight.
676331,Sinker,2012-03-15 03:33:00,8692,I was referring to heavy leaders...50lb+......musky/pike leaders.  S.
