Samuel Smith park in Etobicoke, Etobicoke Creek, and Cooksville Creek in Sauga. Water was fairly clear in these shallow spots.  Since it's gonna be nice this weekend, was thinking of taking my 2 British friends here on a 1 year visa out to catch their first fish ever and they are leaving in 6 weeks. Rather put them onto a fish with some weight than crappies.  Trout is too time consuming and hard to catch for non anglers.  Thanks."

( I just posted a thread about it got a lot of good advice, just look up White sucker in general discussion)"
