676424,captpierre,2012-03-15 16:50:00,2521,Went last night with the wifey.  Similar fishing stuff as the Spring Fishing Show.  More boats.  Significantly more hunting stuff.  Lots of fishing lodges.  I wanted to check out all the ATVs.  There weren't many.  Also as a new cottage owner was disappointed with the lack in  that department. A cool flag guy with telescoping aluminum flagpoles from Sutton. 15-20-25 ft.  Might get one for the lake.  Glad I didn't spend $19.  $5 after 5pm.  only open till 8pm weekdays  Parked at the west end of Harbourfront by the marina underground $9.  Walked about 1km.  nice walk

It's the same stuff, if you've got the time and are looking for something to do, it's ok I don't know if the attendance is low or the new venue is larger, but it seemed alot less crowded today (that's a good thing)"
676609,superdad,2012-03-16 01:31:00,353,"We went to the show on Wednesday and really enjoyed ourselves, the fishing area was all concentrated in the ""A"" Hall with the hunting and outfitters and Army and dog trials over in the ""B"" Hall.  We attended several of the presentations and listened with care to Sheldon Hatch and Jeremy Brooks. we met and talked to all the TV hosts there and were able to voice our comments on their shows.  We had a good time and walked for 3.5 hrs and listened for a couple and then headed home on the MEgaBus.  If you haven't used them to get to TO, then do yourself a favour and check them out. CLUE: know your date of travel and bokk as soon as the date is on their website.  As an example, we came from Kington to TO and return for $16.20 each..........Can't beat that with a stick............  Cheers  David  aka  Superdad"
