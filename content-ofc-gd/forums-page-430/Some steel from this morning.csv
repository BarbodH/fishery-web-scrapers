The water was high but not too stained, fishing was great until the sun started to peek through the fog.  By the looks of mine and other fish caught today (mostly egg eaters and dropbacks) I'd say come opening there won't be many fish left in the creeks and rivers...."
676933,BillM,2012-03-17 01:06:00,17367,Nice fish!  They also hate the mud btw   Try to not let them flop around in it.  A little cotton tailing glove works well.. Keep one in your waders.

Could be very good for Walleye as they will spawn early and recuperate themselves, and march out to some very healthy green weedlines and flats with the warm temps."
