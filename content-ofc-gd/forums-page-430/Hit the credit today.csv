They were saying first timers were catching 5-10 fish with worms or whatever.I'm always the bridesmaid LOL..Never give up I say!"
676464,misfish,2012-03-15 19:18:00,29133,Easy fishing down that way.
676465,Joeytier,2012-03-15 19:19:00,3990,I guess you're a 'sucker' for a good story...
676471,davey buoy,2012-03-15 19:32:00,5505," That's not nice,It's only what I was told."
676472,davey buoy,2012-03-15 19:33:00,5505," Hey, beautiful morning,couple on and lost across the river.Still raging though."
676476,BillM,2012-03-15 19:39:00,17367,Can't beat when you land on top of a pod of fish.
676477,davey buoy,2012-03-15 19:41:00,5505, Still waiting for that day Bill.

676490,davey buoy,2012-03-15 20:31:00,5505, Really?
676491,solopaddler,2012-03-15 20:33:00,8605,For what it's worth I fished it yesterday and it was pretty much trashed.  More rain today and tonight will mean it's going to get even uglier.  Most of the piers in this area are producing VERY well right now.
676494,davey buoy,2012-03-15 20:44:00,5505, .After this rain it's probably not going to get much better for a while?.Thanks for the update.

676541,NAC,2012-03-15 23:16:00,369,The only thing hot about the credit will be the heads of the anglers as they jockey for position. There's no point or place for posts like this on public forums. GTA waters are busy enough without directing the masses to them.  Guess that's why you never see my azz at any of em.

676597,mikeseb,2012-03-16 01:14:00,201,"Dont believe everything you here down there, and please dont post reports on how the fishing is!! the crowds down there are BRUTAL especially with this warm weather.  If im anticipating crowds ill eat a crap load of home made chili the night before fishing, tends to keep everyone at a fair distance"
676598,kingofthesteelhead,2012-03-16 01:16:00,140,"down east the main runs have gone up especially on monday afternoon,never hooked that many fish in a short period of time like that.the warm temperatures have warmed up the creeks and the fish are blowing through.saw a couple of suckers caught today and that is also a sign that the run is almost over."
676604,Christopheraaron,2012-03-16 01:21:00,3525,"These guys are right, let's end this thread now."
