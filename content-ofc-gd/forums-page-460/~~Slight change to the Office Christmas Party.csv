648900,oldphart,2011-12-16 14:43:00,665,"FROM:  Patty Lewis, Human Resources Director TO:    All Employees DATE:  December 1 RE:    Annual Office Christmas Party  I'm happy to inform you that the company Christmas Party will take place on December 23, starting at noon in the private function room at the Grill House. There will be a cash bar and plenty of drinks! We'll have a small band playing traditional carols.  Feel free to sing along. And don't be surprised if our CEO shows up dressed as Santa Claus! A Christmas tree will be lit at 1:00 p.m. Exchange of gifts among employees can be done at that time, however, no gift should be over $10.00 to make the giving of gifts easy for everyone's pockets.  This gathering is only for employees!  A special announcement will be made by our CEO at that time! Merry Christmas to you and your family.  Patty  ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++=  FROM:  Patty Lewis, Human Resources Director TO:    All Employees DATE:  December 2 RE:    Holiday Party  In no way was yesterday's memo intended to exclude our Jewish employees.  We recognize that Chanukah is an important holiday, which often coincides with Christmas, though unfortunately not this year. However, from now on we're calling it our ""Holiday Party.""   The same policy applies to any other employees who are not Christians or those still celebrating Reconciliation Day.  There will be no Christmas tree present.  No Christmas carols sung. We will have other types of music for your enjoyment. Happy now?  Happy Holidays to you and your family. Patty  ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++  FROM:  Patty Lewis, Human Resources Director TO:    All Employees DATE:  December 3 RE:    Holiday Party  Regarding the note I received from a member of Alcoholics Anonymous requesting a non-drinking table... you didn't sign your name. I'm happy to accommodate this request, but if I put a sign on a table that reads ""AA Only"" you wouldn't be anonymous anymore.   How am I supposed to handle this?  Somebody?  Forget about the gift exchange, no gifts are allowed since the union members feel that $10.00 is too much money and executives believe $10.00 is a little chintzy. NO GIFT EXCHANGE WILL BE ALLOWED.  Patty  ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++  FROM:  Patty Lewis, Human Resources Director TO:    All Employees DATE:  December 7 RE:    Holiday Party  What a diverse group we are! I had no idea that December 20th begins the Muslim holy month of Ramadan, which forbids eating and drinking during daylight hours.  There goes the party! Seriously, we can appreciate how a luncheon at this time of year does not accommodate our Muslim employees' beliefs.  Perhaps the Grill House can hold off on serving your meal until the end of the party or else package every- thing for you to take it home in a  little foil doggy baggy. Will that work?  Meanwhile, I've arranged for members of Weight Watchers to sit farthest from the dessert buffet and pregnant women will get the table closest to the restrooms. Gays are allowed to sit with each other. Lesbians do not have to sit with gay men, each will have their own table.  Yes, there will be a flower arrangement for the gay men's table. However,  to the person asking permission to cross dress, no cross dressing allowed.  We will have booster seats for short people. Low-fat food will be available for those on a diet. We cannot control the salt used in the food we suggest for those people with high blood  pressure to taste first.  There will be fresh fruits as dessert for Diabetics, the restaurant cannot supply ""No Sugar"" desserts.   Sorry! Did I miss anything?!?!?  Patty  +++++++++++++++++++++++++++++  FROM:  Patty Lewis, Human Resources Director TO:    All darn Employees DATE:  December 10 RE:    The darn Holiday Party  Vegetarians!! I've had it with you people!!! We're going to keep this party at the Grill House whether you like it or not, so you can sit quietly at the table furthest from the ""grill of death,"" as you so quaintly put it, and you'll get your darn salad bar, including organic tomatoes. But you know, tomatoes have feelings, too. They scream when you slice them.  I've heard them scream. I'm hearing them scream right NOW!   I hope you all have a rotten holiday!   Drive drunk and die, you hear me?  The bugger from HELL!  ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++  FROM:  Joan Bishop, Acting Human Resources Director DATE:  December 14 RE:    Patty Lewis and Holiday Party  I'm sure I speak for all of us in wishing Patty Lewis a speedy recovery and I'll continue to forward your cards to her.  In the meantime, management has decided to cancel our Holiday Party and give everyone the afternoon of the 23rd off with full pay.  Happy Holidays!  PS: HAVE A FANTASTIC WEEKEND!!!"
648901,oldphart,2011-12-16 14:49:00,665,"'Twas the Night Before Christmas      It was about time for Christmas, and all through the house A creature was stirring, but it wasn't a mouse I knew right away it was my wife's little pup, She thought we were sleeping, and so she was up.  The dog was a gift it was coercion, really, A woman can pout, 'til a man gets downright silly. And now the wife was snoozing she was really sacked out She wouldn't have awoke from less than a shout.  Yes, her in her nightgown, I in my BVDs, We had finally settled down to catch some Zs When off in the kitchen there arose such a clatter, I rolled from the bed to see what was the matter.  Away down the hall, my head in a muddle, I reached the kitchen...and stepped in a puddle. The glow from a nightlight illuminated the room, So how come I stumbled over the broom?  I fell in a sprawl, my legs were not stable. On the way down, my nose hit the table. My head was a spinnin' and when I came to rest Four miniature dog feet stood on my chest.  With a lick and a bark, she bounded away, Into the living room, she ran to play. More rapid than mouses, that rat terrier ran, Me on the follow, rolled newspaper in hand.  ""Stop, Skeeter! Stop, Dog! Stop, Pup! Halt, Pooch! Halt, Girl! Oh, come'ere, you mutt! ""Get off the new couch! Now let go of that curtain! Ohhh...If I ever catch you, you're gonna' be hurtin'""  As winds of a Texas tornado do fly, She spun round the room, down low and up high. Then up on the countertop, that puppy went She stopped for a second. I thought she was spent.  I make a quick lunge, she ducked me and then Yawned when I dove through the flour bin. As I drew out my head and was turning around, She made for the presents, in a single bound.  I was covered with flour, from my head to my toes, My robe in tatters, and blood on my nose. A bag full of toys, she grabbed with glee I nabbed her, I thought, but instead got the tree.  The ornaments, they broke, as they began to fall The lights, how they fizzled, and that is not all. When I reached for the plug, to turn the bulbs out, What flowed through my body, but electricity, so stout!  As smoke encircled my head like a wreath, That dog held my big toe, tight in her teeth. ""Skeeter,"" I moaned, ""I give up. Oh, Skeet, I give in."" So she bit my swollen nose, and nipped at my chin.  She spoke not a word, but went back to work, Down came the stockings it took just a jerk. Then up from the hall, came the sound of feet, Momma, it seemed was awake from her sleep.  ""Now you'll get it pup,"" I announced with glee. Then Skeeter walked over and put her little head on my knee. She looked up at my wife - so innocent - and at me, so, so sad. And it didn't take long, to know I'd been had.  Then came the wife's voice, so strong and so clear, ""Bill, you leave that puppy alone! You hear!"" And I exclaimed to myself, as they walked out with a strut, ""Don't leave any gifts, Santa just PICK UP THE MUTT!"""
648904,oldphart,2011-12-16 14:53:00,665,"Here is how to make my favorite Christmas Cookie:  Christmas Cookie Ingredients: 1 cup of water 1 tsp baking soda 1 cup of sugar 1 tsp salt 1 cup of brown sugar 1 tsp lemon juice 4 large eggs 1 cup nuts 2 cups of dried fruit 1 bottle Jose Cuervo 1800 Tequilla or equiv  Sample the Cuervo to check quality.  Take a large bowl, check the Cuervo again, to be sure it is of the highest quality, pour one level cup and drink.  Turn on the electric mixer... Beat one cup of butter in a large fluffy bowl.  Add one teaspoon of sugar... Beat again.  At this point it's best to make sure the Cuervo is still OK, try another cup... just in case.  Turn off the mixerer thingy.  Break 2 leggs and add to the bowl and chuck in the cup of dried fruit.  Pick the frigging fruit off floor... Mix on the turner.  If the fried druit gets stuck in the beaterers just pry it loose with a drewscriver.  Sample the Cuervo to check for tonsisticity.  Next, sift two cups of salt, or something.  Who giveshz a sheet.  Check the Jose Cuervo.  Now shift the lemon juice and strain your nuts.  Add one table. Add a spoon of sugar, or somefink.  Whatever you can find.  Greash the oven.  Turn the cake tin 360 degrees and try not to fall over. Don't forget to beat off the turner.  Finally, throw the bowl through the window, finish the Cose Juervo and make sure to put the stove in the dishwasher.  CHERRY MISTMAS"
