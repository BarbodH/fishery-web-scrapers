648703,Billy Bob,2011-12-15 18:59:00,5865,BTW I sold my only firearm at the time to get the bride her engagement ring....and gave it to her 2 days before Christmas at a little restaurant called Piccolo's that is no longer there...now it's a pizza shop...every time I drive by I think back to that day....
648706,irishfield,2011-12-15 19:18:00,26272,It's good Bob.. you and I can remember when/where so many moons ago. For us it will be 30 years in August. Too many today met in a bar.... blow a fortune on a ring and wedding ...and are divorced in 9 months.
648708,Billy Bob,2011-12-15 19:27:00,5865,Met the bride over 32 years ago in a camp ground on the shores of Chautauqua Lake while I was building my summer home/cottage. Celebrated our 30th wedding anniversary back in October....she's the BEST...  And your right.....too many are spending their fortune....errr future on weddings and shiny things.  We went to Toronto for our honeymoon.     then the rest to the week at our cottage....

648731,kickingfrog,2011-12-15 20:58:00,8333,"I remember a female comedian used to joke that because her husband gave her an engagement ring on Christmas that, before they were divorced he owed her a Christmas present."

By the next Christmas it was too late to back out. Going on 22 years now. I tell ya, I don't deserve her, and she sure as heck didn't do anything bad enough to  deserve me."

648781,irishfield,2011-12-16 00:38:00,26272,Yah it did Dave.. but it didnt' go far in '82!
648785,Billy Bob,2011-12-16 00:48:00,5865," Yep, '81 was the cut off date....that's when I spent $500 and got her a 5K diamond....at least that's what I told her it was....  Edited for accuracy...it was 1980 when I asked her....married in '81"

648821,vinnimon,2011-12-16 02:18:00,2593,"I havent read through this thread thoroughly, but I chuckled lol.  Anyone wishing to buy a ring with 3 diamonds on it, yes THREE  3333, pm me!  An engagement ring, and I am NOT KIDDING AROUND!!!!!! Or it will be the clearest and most shiniest thing that a fish has ever seen without feeling a tug, trust me on that!!!!!  Yes I am  to do that very soon!!!!! Unless someone needs something nice for their better half."
648843,skeeter,2011-12-16 03:42:00,1907,"I bet you didn't know, that when you said ""till death do us part"" you were setting a goal for yourself!!"
648868,Jer,2011-12-16 10:47:00,1426,  I like to think of it as being efficient...
648964,bigbuck,2011-12-16 19:17:00,2449,"Good one Jer!!! For all the guys who are in their 40s and up, the last time people were really happy was in the early 80s and earlier. They didn't have much but they sure appreciated what they had. These days, people are too caught up in materialistic Bull. Gotta have the biggest and baddest of whatever."
648966,Harrison,2011-12-16 19:39:00,2202," My situation to a T, except 2 girls and she ""would"" say no!"

648618,Skipper D,2011-12-15 14:12:00,1970,"Heard about the two french guys talking to each other on christmas eve , one was telling the other that he got his wife a new thunder bird and the other guy said , what! a new ford thunder bird , Ya... what did you get for your wife , the other says .... i got my wife a new chevell . the other guy says ... wow! a new chevrolet chevell , the guy says no! dam it ... a new snow chevell ."
648620,Nipfisher,2011-12-15 14:16:00,2449,"If I asked her again (after 6 years and 2 boys) she might say ""no"". Better to just stick with the status quo and pretend it is a fairytale.....and they lived happily ever after."
648629,Billy Bob,2011-12-15 15:18:00,5865,"I love being married................it's my wife that I don't like..  And you really want to get into trouble, just introduce her at this years Christmas Parties as ""This is my first wife, Cindy""..."
648636,Rod Caster,2011-12-15 15:50:00,5784,"She's dropping hints and seems to enjoy embarassing me in from of friends by saying ""I don't see a ring, yet"".  We bought each other a TV for Christmas, to replace our 15"", 20 year old model, if that's not commitment, then what is? Honestly I'm just waiting until we have more money between the two of us, why the heck would be get married under stressful conditions?"
648643,cheaptackle,2011-12-15 16:24:00,849,  I KNEW you'd be moving back this way!  The ring would have been cheaper in the long run!  Michael
648648,Rod Caster,2011-12-15 16:28:00,5784,"  If I didn't have a GF, I could have afforded a ring months ago."
648651,Billy Bob,2011-12-15 16:32:00,5865,"If it's money your truly concerned with.....it's much cheaper to get a hooker, maid and cook when needed...."
648653,torco,2011-12-15 16:34:00,656,"I thought it was going to be honey will you let me buy this (insert fishing equipment here). Hahaha, marriage has whipped me good and I am only 3 years in."

648689,bigbuck,2011-12-15 18:27:00,2449,"  Irish, it's just being frugal, that's all. Why buy gifts at Christmas time +a ring later, just buy it at this time of year and you are off the hook........."
648693,irishfield,2011-12-15 18:30:00,26272,Frugal.. I had no money in '82.. get her to buy her own ring.. now that's frugal !
648697,Billy Bob,2011-12-15 18:49:00,5865, Errrrrr....no that's cheap...or very clever...you make the call....
648699,irishfield,2011-12-15 18:53:00,26272,I think it was called BROKE at the time Bob !
648701,Billy Bob,2011-12-15 18:56:00,5865,As long as it's fixed now...that's all that matters....
