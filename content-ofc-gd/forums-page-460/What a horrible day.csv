648934,NAW,2011-12-16 17:05:00,4022,"I've been checking this post a few times a day Bruce, waiting for your updates.  We're all rooting for Peanut's speedy recovery.  Hopefully it's all up hill from here eh"
649014,Joey,2011-12-16 21:50:00,9122,"Wow Bruce, just checked back on this thread, sorry to hear Peanut is not healing properly.  I hope he makes it out of this.  Please update us when you can!  My thoughts will be with little Peanut hoping for a full recovery!!"
649040,BillM,2011-12-16 23:42:00,17367, No breed out there has a 'locking jaw'.  Unfortunately some breeds can do a whole hell of a lot more damage in a small amount of time then others.
648054,bigugli,2011-12-13 20:16:00,6138,"I have owned, or handled, dogs all my life. Most were retrievers and Dobs. Only one dog turned vicious and it was put down quick, despite the son's objections. I don't blame the dog. This dog has been allowed to be a predator, and the owners have no control. I filed a complaint with animal control and will see how that goes first. I do expect these people to pay all the bills, else this will get nasty. When the attack was happening one lady stopped her vehicle to do us a kindness and drove us back to our car. Wish I got her name to thank her properly."
648067,motion,2011-12-13 21:20:00,403,"I'm so sorry to hear what has happened to your Peanut. I can tell by the images that is was a severe attack that could have ended up much worse.  I unfortunately had a similar (though not nearly as severe)attack on my poor little lab pup when he was 9 months old. We own a place up north and my next door neighbour owns a wonderful 7 year old King Sheppard. He is one of the most well behaved, good natured dog I have ever met. He has been a mentor to my lab since he was just a wee thing. Hilarious to watch him teaching my little guy.  Three doors down lives the complete opposite in a very mean King Shepard. One day while playing with the next door neighbour's dog, the other Sheppard showed up and proceeded to chop on my much smaller Lab pump piercing his shoulder and drawing blood. Luckily I was close by as was my neighbour and the other dogs owner. I am afraid to think of what may have happened if we didn't intervene as quickly as we did.  My pup learned a valuable lesson in not trusting all dogs. Hes a very friendly dog but is much more cautious when approaching new dogs now.   Hoping Peanut has a speeding and full recovery.  Cheers."
648107,Spiel,2011-12-13 23:09:00,9065,A horrible thing to have to go through Bruce.  I hope Peanut is back up to speed quickly.  I have a good friend who watched his small dog torn in half at the jaws of two large dogs while it was on the leash. He was defenseless to stop the attack. I can't even begin to imagine how traumatic it must have been for you and Peanut.
648115,fishforfun,2011-12-13 23:40:00,105,Can't tell from the pics but is Peanut a scottish terrier? Sorry that happened and like others have said go after the owner for compensation.
648136,bigugli,2011-12-14 00:37:00,6138,"Peanut is a Jack/poodle cross, or... Jackapoo."
648139,skeeter,2011-12-14 00:42:00,1907,"It IS the owners and how they raise their dogs. I had a king shepard. He would do anything I told him to. If a cat ran out in front of him he would instinctively start to chase it. When I told him to stop he would stop instantly . He was very well behaved and never had any kind of incident with him.  To Bruce and Peanut, we wish both of you a speedy recovery!"
648146,Leecher,2011-12-14 00:52:00,7832,Wow Bruce... the first pic hurts me looking at it     Glad that your friend is home and resting    Wish him a speedy recovery. Jacques
648148,limeyangler,2011-12-14 00:54:00,5204,Hey Bruce...really sorry to hear that.....man....that sucks...must've been very scary.
648162,Fish Farmer,2011-12-14 01:17:00,2234,"Gezzz Bruce, that picture sure makes me think what I would have done. I hope your little buddy makes a good recovery. Theres only one place a biting animal belongs Next, it could be someones kid."
648185,WalleyeSlayer,2011-12-14 02:07:00,26,"I highly disagree with many people saying the dog should be put down. But I'll keep my rant to myself.  Solopaddler, I agree with John. That guy would definately wake up in the hospital if he every touched my Hucky like that!  I hope Peanut has a quick and speedy recovery.  "
648188,MJL,2011-12-14 02:17:00,2427,Prayers sent for Peanut's speedy recovery
648711,bigugli,2011-12-15 19:38:00,6138,"Well, Peanut is not out of danger yet. Had to rush her back to the vet. A lot of the skin started to break down. Much more tissue trauma than was realized. We now have to wait and see.  On a side note, there will be no problem in being compensated by the other family."
648712,lew,2011-12-15 19:49:00,12766,That's lousy news about Peanut Bruce but hopefully everything will work out well for the little guy.  Thanks for the update.
648713,TJQ,2011-12-15 19:53:00,7806,"I hope the dog is going to be ok... compensation or not... once a dog goes nasty like that for no reason, it needs to be tied."
648725,fishnsled,2011-12-15 20:38:00,3520,Too bad things are not going well right now for Peanut. Nice to know that the owners are taking the responsible route but little compensation for what Peanut and the family has been through in the past few days. I sure hope that things get better for the pooch and thanks for the update.
648733,Familyfisherman,2011-12-15 21:02:00,188,"Awful thread.  I have 2 friends who were bitten in the face as kids, both have major scarring...one is a guy, one is a girl -- not that it's completely different but the girl really suffered from the scarring.  Both dogs were large, and were family pets without prior incidents...but things happen...  I live in Barrie, several years ago in Alcona (if I remember correctly) a family dog tore out of the yard, grabbed a 4-year old by the neck and shook her to death before the owner could get there...it was a dog with a locking jaw, etc...in a separate incident in a small community near Barrie a mastif and a pitbull together attacked and killed several (I think 4 or 5) neighbourhood cats/dogs before the owner realized they had tunnelled under the fence while he was at work...they were going out terrorizing the area during the day and returning before he arrived back.  The serial killings ended when the two attacked and ripped a cat to pieces in front of 12 8 year olds at a neighbouring house celebrating a birthday party, and they knew the dogs and reported it.  In each case the animals were eventually destroyed.  I'm not blaming specific breeds, or big dogs for that matter...but, if you plan to own a larger breed, especially one that has a history of biting, you simply MUST keep them leashed and under control -- do the work necessary to train them -- IT'S YOUR RESPONSIBILITY.  If anyone in my family suffered something like that I would be VERY frustrated.  We just got a new golden doodle...obviously not a feared breed, but it is a big dog and we've been working to train her.  She's almost 5 mths -- so far so good.  I agree with many -- OWNERS NEED TO BE FOUND LIABLE MORE OFTEN...perhaps that would stop the senseless and preventable attacks."
648734,bassmaster4,2011-12-15 21:06:00,801,sad to hear buddy. hope peanut gets well soon. Just last week had a sheperd run at my car almost smashed it owners just sitting on the porch dogs not on a leash in a residential area obviously something was wrong with it that thing looked vicious.
648798,workwear,2011-12-16 01:34:00,592,sorry to hear bout this....i have a wiemeraner and we frequent a local dog park frequently.....and the ONLY  breed that im scared of is sheperds......have seen some pretty nasty scraps....not to blame the breed...but some owners cant handle them!!!
648835,Jewelbee,2011-12-16 03:03:00,422,"Wishing a speedy recovery to Peanut! I sincerely hope it all goes well. Good thing the dog's owner is paying the vet bills....they are entirely responsible.  As a large dog owner,(Collies) I am not immune to this situation myself, My dogs and I have been rushed several times in our own neighborhood and I have had to deal with a 3 way dog fight more than once! My dogs on leashes! On one occasion I took my dogs home and went over and BLASTED the German Shepard owner. The dog was gone about a week later....(not the dog's fault)"
648899,torco,2011-12-16 14:40:00,656,"  Funny, I had a terrible experience with a wiemeraner that tried to attack my German Shepherd when she was still a puppy so I unfortunately have bias against them although I try my best not too. We were packing up from a soccer game and I was taking off my shin pads and had my dog on leash in my hand this thing came out of nowhere and charged us, thankfully I didn't have good grip on the lease and my dog was able to pull away and maneuver out of being bitten. It caused a real melee because my friends have rottweiler that immediately pulled its way into the mix but the good news is that the rottweiler intimidated the wiemeraner into backing away. The owner was still a good soccer field away at this point. Anyways so many people regardless of breed have no clue when it comes to dogs, sometimes I think we forget they are dogs and it only takes seconds for things to go bad, especially with the large breeds.   As German Shepherd owner you definitely don't feel the love and many are intimidated by them and I think they often pick up on that nervous energy. But you see incidents like poor peanut here and you can see why people are afraid.  Here are some interesting stats for the large dog owner out there and why you need to have control of your dog not that small-mid sized dog owners are off the hook:  The German Shepherd has a bite force of 238lbs Rottweiler around 265 Pitbull 235 Golden Retriever 230 How does this compare to other animals Humans around 120 Lions around 700"
648906,crappieperchhunter,2011-12-16 15:16:00,2582, Not sure the bite force of my better half. But that's not even the scary part....the scary part is the bark   Sorry peanuts ordeal has hit a speed bump Bruce. That little fella is full of piss & vinegar though so I'm sure things will be OK.
648912,Big Cliff,2011-12-16 15:55:00,6899,How is Peanut doing today Bruce?  I wonder if the other dog owners insurance will cover this or will this be out of their pocket? I can see this costing a bundle!
648921,bigugli,2011-12-16 16:21:00,6138,"  Just got off the phone with the vet. Hugh is a conscientious and caring vet, and he has done all he can. So far so good. Need a few more days to know if the hide will heal and not break down again. Enough of a spunky little bugger to pull out her drain.  I have no idea how this is being paid for at this point. I do feel sorry for the other family, as they try to explain things to their kids. I was a ""murderer"" when I put the one dog down when he turned nasty"
648923,mercman,2011-12-16 16:27:00,7054,"I'm teary eyed reading this Bruce.I love dogs, and hate to see them injured.Keep us posted on Peanuts progress please   Paul"
648930,torco,2011-12-16 16:45:00,656,"  Thanks for the update, I think everyone here is hoping for the best for peanut.  You are a good man to be thinking of the other family at this time. If you do talk to them there might be a chance the dog does not need to be put down, it could find a home as a guard dog at somewhere."
647781,Dutch,2011-12-12 23:38:00,831,"Hope your dog comes out OK and that you are not too worse for wear.  Many of ther other posters are saying to go to the police, or humane society and I agree.  If there is any doubt in your mind about reporting it, think about what may happen after the next attack.  The pet may be killed and the owner may not come out of it unscathed either.  This is no time to suck it up and be a good neighbour."
647785,bigugli,2011-12-12 23:52:00,6138,"Thanks for all the kind words gang   Peanut is doing O.K. Needed 40 something stitches. She's been sedated for the night. As for the other dog owners. The local SPCA has been directly involved. Their dog was not on a leash, Peanut always is. Under law the other fellas are fully liable for all the costs under provincial law. The animal control officer will inform them of that fact. The Vet knows the drill and took pics as soon as I brought Peanut in and has forwarded the pics and medical assessment. As for my cane, I took it to the welding shop to get straightened. Next time I'm pouring lead jigs, I'm filling the bottom half of the cane. I am now slowly starting to calm down...  But I still can't get the image of that animal shaking Peanut around like a ragdoll.  One way or tuther, it will be put down. need a couple more glasses of brandy. Good thing I made a few bottles."
647789,kuhaman,2011-12-13 00:07:00,503,"Glad to here that your dog is ok. I had the same kind of experience with a sheppard, very scary!! Elderberry brandy?"
647790,BillM,2011-12-13 00:11:00,17367,"Glad to here your dog is doing ok, that other one deserves a bullet between the eyes."
647804,Big Cliff,2011-12-13 00:31:00,6899,"Sorry to disagree but I think it is the owners that need the bullet, that dog should never have been allowed to run loose.  Bruce, really glad to hear that Peanut is going to be ok. We had one of our dogs attacked by two shepards once, she was never the same again and ended up having to be put down about two years later because she developed problems with her spine."
647808,tb4me,2011-12-13 00:39:00,3295,"wow that's insane! I too have had an experience with Sheppard's. I witnessed 2 BIG male German Shapers (both unleashed on the loose) run out of nowhere and attack a Husky. The guy was walking his husky on the trail by the river as I was walking out after wading for Walleyes. The only thing the guy could do was let his Husky go and take on one of the Shepherds. By the time I got there The Husky and the man had the situation under control. I couldn't believe what I had just seen. Did that Husky really just take on 2 bigger dogs and win? No it didn't.. the Husky was in bad shape. Never did find out what happened with the Husky, but wow is all I could say.."
647824,dhickey,2011-12-13 01:20:00,1038,Sorry to here about Peanut. It truly is a gut wrenching expeirance when its your friend being attacked.  Ps I hope your wife or a good friend has the key to your gun cabnit? Tomorow when Peanut is glad to be with you all will be a little better
647830,Skipper D,2011-12-13 01:31:00,1970,Iam sure the brandy will help ease things a bit and that things go ok for peanut .  
647835,Rustic-Fisher,2011-12-13 01:43:00,826,"No excuse for that dogs aggression, Hope your pup heals fast."
647836,uglyfish,2011-12-13 01:46:00,981,"Terrible news to read! Sorry to hear bruce, hope peanut has a speedy recovery and is back eating perch in no time! Glad to hear u were not injured by the dog as well!"
647840,spincast,2011-12-13 02:00:00,3279,I hope everything turns out Ok for you and peanut. The owner of the Shep needs a lesson or two in accountability.  
647841,ccmtcanada,2011-12-13 02:04:00,7971,Wow....what a horrible thing to happen!  I'm glad peanut is going to be fine and it sounds like restitution will be made....hoping for a speedy recovery!
647846,danbouck,2011-12-13 02:15:00,4380,I am glad Peanut will be okay.  I can't stand people who raise animals like that. I have a German Sheppard and people are always scared of her at first because of cases like this. They quickly learn that she wouldn't hurt a fly.
647849,OutdoorDan,2011-12-13 02:20:00,325,"   No.  It sucks when these things happen but they are usually a result of bad ownership, not the dog's fault."
647850,solopaddler,2011-12-13 02:20:00,8605,"What a horrible thing to have happen, truly hope your pooch recovers.  As a responsible dog owner I find it despicable when people let their animals run out of control, especially large aggressive breeds.  I had a pretty horrible experiences myself earlier this fall, occurring on the only trail system that allows dogs off leash that's anywhere close to me.  Ironically the issue wasn't with another dog, but a dog owner, but I digress.  My dog is a 1 year old German Shorthair, a high energy breed that needs to run every day. She's absolutely not agressive at all, in fact she's really just a big happy idiot LOL!  A couple months back I was walking her on the trail off leash. She's a hunting breed is a pure joy to watch as she works the bush back and forth in front of me. She never runs off either, always staying within sight as that's how she's been trained.  If there ever are people walking on the trail she barely gives them pause. If there's another dog she'll run up, tail wagging, sniff, say hello and be on her way...  Anyhow I'm on the trail and up ahead there's a couple walking a small terrier on leash. No big deal I think, 'cause as I said my dog's not the least bit aggressive.  The small dog sees mine and goes nuts, barking pyschotically and jumping and straining at its leash.  My girl trots up, stops about 3' away, looks at the little dog freaking out and lets out one big woof. That's it, nothing more.  At that point the guy kicks my dog as hard as he can in the ribs...she screamed in pain...then he grabbed her collar and wrenched her neck up twisting it and choking her...she was gagging.  At that point I started running towards them and he says quite loudly ""Keep your ....ing dog under control ...hole!""  The entire time this is happening the terrier is literally going postal, snarling, snapping, hackles raised, just itching to get at my dog. There's no doubt in my mind that if the woman had let go of the leash at any time it would have attacked.  Anyway I'm not usually a violent man, let's just leave it at that.  My dog was subsequently checked at the vets and as I suspected she had cracked ribs from the kick.  Couldn't lie down or get up without whining in pain for quite a while.  I consider myself to be a responsible dog owner and that includes allowing my dog to run on a daily basis.  When something like that happens at what is really my only refuge it becomes an issue. What exactly is one to do?"
647859,woodenboater,2011-12-13 02:48:00,2277,"There are some better men than me on this board, esp with Solo's account cuz I'm not sure what I would have done but ugly would have been in the equation. I'm getting worked up reading these stories and it makes me truly sad that people can be such idiots.  Bruce, I hope the owner loses his dog to a better, responsible owner, if indeed it can be rehabilitated. And Solo, that owner will get his eventually and chances are someone is going to give the boots to his terrier some day if it's got a bad attitude and is a biter, small dog or not."
647891,crappieperchhunter,2011-12-13 05:30:00,2582,Just got in from working afternoons and sat down to read this. Can't imagine what I would have done. Probably would have been too shocked to even react in time to help my pet out.  Glad the perch muncher is Ok. Wounds heal. Hopefully the emotional scars are easily mended as well.  Tomorrow will be a better day.  Take care of your little buddy my friend.
647894,dhickey,2011-12-13 06:01:00,1038,  Had a terrior bite me on the back of my leg yesterday  Bad dogs are in evey breed or mix. Bad owners are usualy to blame.  The terrior was ok but still went after me today but next time it will be on the wrong side of a steel toed boot!!!
648007,bigugli,2011-12-13 16:42:00,6138,"What a relief. Brought peanut home this morning. They figure at least 3 weeks for the bruising and wounds to heal. Here is the after pic.  I won't put up the before pics that the vet took. Have to keep her sedated for the next few days with pain meds. When she got home she wanted nothing to do with the dog bed. She limped into the bedroom, determined to get into our bed, safe and warm under the comforter. This is my cane after trying to beat off the other dog.  The son heated it and got it bent back at the welding shop because I sure couldn't. I am ever so grateful that we have such a wonderful vet. Hugh Stevenson, and his staff at Hillview. Nothing beats a good old fashioned horse doctor"
648013,crappieperchhunter,2011-12-13 17:15:00,2582,Glad Peanut is home safe and sound Bruce. That's a nasty looking picture right there...couldn't imagine the before photo. Did you save some of the brandy for Peanut.
648018,Gregoire,2011-12-13 17:50:00,1397,"Being a small breed owner I shudder hearing stories like this. I also feel very sorry for solo having a negative experience with a small breed. As has previously been stated the problem is the dog owner not the dog. Sometimes I think it is the owners, not the dogs that should be liscenced."
648022,NAW,2011-12-13 18:13:00,4022,"Dam Bruce. Peanuts gunna be feeling that one for while.  Those looks like some serious cuts.  I'm glad things turned out alright, and peanut's gunna pull through.  Let us know how it works out with the vet bills eh.  I went home last night, after reading your post, and played fetch with my little dog for a good hour or so.."
648028,John,2011-12-13 18:19:00,2956,"Sorry to hear that Bruce, I'm sure that Peanut will be OK you will make sure of that.  As for the Shepherd, well, I am not sure that all would agree with me but I don't blame the dog. In 90% of the cases of aggressive dogs, both to other dogs, other animals and humans, it is the ""owner"" that is at fault. I am of the belief that pets learn the personality of their owners who they consider to be their leader.  Bruce, I would not let this die. I would make sure that at the very least they pay the vet bills.  By the way Mike........anyone kicked my dog in the ribs and they would be waking up in hospital........unfortunately, I would possibly go to jail!"
648029,torco,2011-12-13 18:25:00,656,"Sorry to hear that, it makes me sick and I have a German Shepherd and would never want her to do that to anyones animal or vise versa.  As a German Shepherd owner (purebred), I find a lot of owners give us a bad name.  The German Shepherd is a good breed like most but needs a good owner as they are working dogs and have high energy and drive. You need to give them lots of exercise or a job to do.  This dog is likely not well trained/socialized and does not get the necessary exercise needed and its prey drive just took over. Obviously just me speculating.  I am not surprised at the damagebecause they are such a powerful dog and that's why you need to be a good owner.  I hope your dog has a quick recovery and what a scary incident."
648032,capt bruce,2011-12-13 18:42:00,820,"As the owner of two large dogs , when I took on ownership of these animals I KNEW WHAT I WAS IN FOR . Spent money very early on to have them trained , made sure they went to the dog park and learned to be socialized with other dogs , they are old now , touch wood , in all the time  I have owned them , 14+ years ,I never had a problem with them . BUT if either of them ,as much as I love them , ever made a problem I would put them down myselve .You can not bring a large animal into your neiborhood without takeing FULL responsibility for what it does . So sorry to hear this hope all will be well , not saying you want to be a pain , but do not allow this to go unreported . Next time some other dog or some other PERSON , will be killed . I would do all I could to protect your neibors , no way you let this dog and its stupid owner  get away with this , this was not an accident , just a loaded gun waiting to go off , today peanut tomorrow Sally down the street ."
647703,bigugli,2011-12-12 20:02:00,6138,"Went for my usual morning walk with Peanut and we were attacked by a big shepherd. Thing came charging from a house across the street. Before I could get between and pick Peanut up, this thing had her between its jaws. Shook her around like a ragdoll. The useless  of owners just walking up, cursing at their dog, while I'm trying to beat the thing back with my cane.  Broke my cane over its back and it still would not let go. When we finally got Peanut free, half the skin on her right side had been flensed right off, and about a dozen more punctures in her hind. Miraculously, she seemed to escape any internal damage, but she's gonna need a lot of time to heal. I'll get to see her this afternoon, and hopefully  there won't be any permanent damage."

It sounds like you did all that you could do.  You need a stronger cane!  I don't want to open a can of worms, but did you press charges?  Or can you?"
647716,fishnsled,2011-12-12 20:19:00,3520,"That sucks!  I was out walking the dog a week or so ago and another person was walking their dog...without a leash. It bolts after my dog, luckily it was more looking to play. I couldn't get between my dog and the other one either. The owner eventually got the dog by the collar as I grabbed mine and exchanged a few choice words. I hate people who don't control their dogs as well or at least think they know how to but really don't have a clue.  Speedy recovery for Peanut and I'd be all over the owners for the vet bills."
647717,aplumma,2011-12-12 20:24:00,6896,Sorry to hear that. You might also decide to take photos of the damage and have the shepherd documented by the local law enforcement. It might get the owner to step up to the plate and contain his animal before it hurt a kid one day.  Art

647732,misfish,2011-12-12 20:58:00,29133,"Sorry to hear.Peanut was on a leash Bruce? The shepard?  If peanut was on a leach and the other not you are fully in your right to go after the other people for full compensation. Broke your cane eh,guess you know what you need the next one made of. Wounldnt hurt to a alittle pop out shiv,just saying.Next time it might be you and peanut."
647735,blaque,2011-12-12 21:06:00,2419,Ugh.......just terrible. I cant even imagine.......Prayers go out to Peanut.
647736,Lip-ripper,2011-12-12 21:08:00,228,That sucks. I've witnessed it and it's not a pretty sight. Was also a Shepherd attack. I'll never trust that breed.
647737,woodenboater,2011-12-12 21:13:00,2277,"Hope Peanut comes out ok and not too skittish after this attack.  I'd be going after the owners like flies on crap. Their cavalier attitude needs to be adjusted permanently and with serious consequences and indeed, if it was a young child or infant , who knows what might have happened. I really can't blame the dog, but the owners... Hell, they should be banned from ownership for a long time and forced to do community, cleaning up at a shelter."
647738,COUNTRYBOY,2011-12-12 21:14:00,130,"POOR PEANUT, HOPE SHE GETS WELL SOON"
647739,Rizzo,2011-12-12 21:16:00,4754," There was a piece in Friday's Examiner about a woman who had her nose tore off by her neighbour's dog - years of pain, scarring, surgeries etc. Scary stuff when people don't properly restrain their animals. All the best to Peanut, I'm sure you're both very frazzled by the whole thing."
647745,vinnimon,2011-12-12 21:24:00,2593,"I'm really sorry to hear about peanut, Bruce . Some pet owners should keep Close watch of their pets, and I'm sure that you know exactly what to do regarding the other pet, and it's owner."
647750,DanD,2011-12-12 21:34:00,2223,"I would definitely call the cops & animal control; dogs regardless of what or who they attack, are only allowed 2 recorded bites,(London bylaw?) before they must be put down. Plus if the owner of the attacking dog cannot provide proof of vaccination shots; the dog will also have to be put in quarantine for X number of days/weeks, along with a fine for the owner. Get this one recorded by the officials; it’ll give the dog’s owner a bit of a smack up side the head for be so irresponsible. You never know maybe this isn’t its first attack and you’ll be saving someone else’s dog or possible a Child? Hope for a speedy recovery.  Dan."
647754,Joey,2011-12-12 21:45:00,9122,Sorry to hear that Bruce.  I sure hope Peanut is okay and feels better soon
647756,aplumma,2011-12-12 21:54:00,6896,  Just wear your magic earrings Joey.  A few days of them and he will acting like a puppy again.  Art
647757,lew,2011-12-12 21:54:00,12766,"Damn Bruce, that's absolutely terrible news and like everyone else, I sure hope little Peanut is gonna be OK."
647758,cityfisher,2011-12-12 21:54:00,959,the other dogs owner is paying for the damages Right???  had an instance last week where this crazy black dog ran up to me and my buddy walking his english setter... I was about to Boot the other dog before things got out of control... Funny thing was there were 2-3 signs in this park saying KEEP DOG ON LEASH... i told the owner... Can you read you idiot???
647759,Big Cliff,2011-12-12 21:59:00,6899,"Sorry to hear that Bruce, I too hope Peanut comes out of this ok. As others have said get the police involved or you could get stuck with the vet bills."
647776,livinisfishin,2011-12-12 23:24:00,661,Sorry to hear about your dog peanut. Hope everything turns out well!
647779,Leecher,2011-12-12 23:35:00,7832,"That's terrible news Bruce.  Hope your friend get's well soon.  As awfull as it was, dog's are resilient and they bounce back in no time.  I've had this happen to my pooch in my driveway and he was fine right after.... a little shaken from the ordeal but jumping like it never happened."
