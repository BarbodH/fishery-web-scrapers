648201,Freshtrax,2011-12-14 03:24:00,2215,"Anyone point me in the right direction of a few lakes that might be iced up enough to walk on around boxing day in this area myother half's family are down there all hunters no fishermen. And with no experiance down there i have no idea where to start.  Id love to be into some whities and lakers but i dont think there are any down there so i will settle for targeting toothy creatures like pike , walleye. And if all else fails perch.  I would think bieng a fair bit north of southern ontairo some smaller waterbodys will be iced but maby thats just wishfull thinking this year."

648415,simonl,2011-12-14 22:12:00,28,"When I lived there, Nodes point at Rideau Ferry was always good for early ice. For some reason it froze earlier than all the other lakes and areas. Good for Pike and Crappies. This yr, boxing day may be a stretch mind you....no hints of winter there or here in Pembroke yet!  Mercman, who did you visit in Jones Falls? I grew up there and it wasn't what you would call a large anonymous community! lol"
648447,cranks bait,2011-12-14 23:53:00,721,Don't get your hopes up....I was still able to get my yak into the back bays of the Larry on Sunday.  Not sure what inland lakes are like but it's supposed to be plus 10 tomorrow.
648473,Freshtrax,2011-12-15 01:29:00,2215,Hey law of attraction ...everyone think cold thoughts....   Seriously a coupple cold nights can do wonders.
