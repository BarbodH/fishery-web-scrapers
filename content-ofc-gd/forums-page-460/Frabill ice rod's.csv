648777,bassnass,2011-12-16 00:31:00,174,Saw a couple at SAIL - $65 price range.  Wanted one until I saw that.  I've got a couple of fly reels.
648784,GBW,2011-12-16 00:47:00,8460,Want to hand one over then Linc?
648938,BillM,2011-12-16 17:22:00,17367,A small 3.5in centerpin sounds like the ticket.
648948,Billy Bob,2011-12-16 18:17:00,5865,"Oh my....I don't know how I ever coped ice fishing for perch without a fly reel...  Does anyone here but me think these outdoor writers do a article on some product ONLY because it was sent to them FREE....One of my hunting/fishing partners is a ""outdoor writer"" and his garage is full of crap that he hasn't even had the chance to take out of the boxes yet (years)...."
648949,canadadude,2011-12-16 18:32:00,769,"a tip for line twist, carry a small square of leather chamois in your pocket, run the last 10' of line through the leather and it will instantly get rid of the twist."
648970,GBW,2011-12-16 19:58:00,8460,I just grabbed a small fly reel and Sinclair gave me his old Light action ice fishing rod to test it with.
648971,BillM,2011-12-16 20:04:00,17367, I'm sure that would work fine...  Remove the clicker so you get a decent freespool when letting line out.
648972,GBW,2011-12-16 20:08:00,8460,that's the plan.  already sppoled up with #6 nanofil and ready to go!
648973,kickingfrog,2011-12-16 20:13:00,8333,Won't it look silly without some silk line on it?
648979,BillM,2011-12-16 20:30:00,17367," 6lb Nanofil is like dental floss! lol!   Use it on my Frogwater, it's awesome stuff!"
649024,GBW,2011-12-16 22:48:00,8460,"come on Bill, it's stronger and smaller then floss..."
649036,BillM,2011-12-16 23:17:00,17367, LOL!!  I think it might be woven out of unicorn hair...
649038,GBW,2011-12-16 23:33:00,8460,I thought yettie
649086,kickingfrog,2011-12-17 04:01:00,8333,"Sorry guys, my silk reference was to old fly line. Not the new stuff."
646266,tb4me,2011-12-07 20:55:00,3295,lol and yikes..
646270,kickingfrog,2011-12-07 21:15:00,8333,It would make you think twice about changing spoons.  Nothing wrong in 30 or so feet or less. Less moving parts is usually a good thing in winter.
646338,GBW,2011-12-08 01:04:00,8460,"Hey Phil, have I told you today?!?!?! Man I have to get me one of those rod's and the price, damn you! But, I have to wait and see what Santa get's for me first.  (I hope it's a Fenwick!)"
646370,skeeter,2011-12-08 03:14:00,1907,I know bridget the midget from her movies before she got married.
646378,Fishnwire,2011-12-08 03:42:00,983,After reading some of these comments I'm a little less anxious to lay my hard earned bucks down on one.
646397,limeyangler,2011-12-08 11:12:00,5204,   With the tip-up across the back of the shoulders......
646420,Harrison,2011-12-08 13:25:00,2202,   Ha!  the Fenwick Elites are a wicked ice rod IMO.  That's why they are in my store. Sinclair liked them I think. See ya on the 26th
646422,GBW,2011-12-08 13:33:00,8460,they are a real nice looking and feeling rod.  even the fake cork grip feels nice and that the whole top half of the grip winds down with no threads showing is a plus too.
646441,Guest chase4chrome,2011-12-08 14:31:00,0," Dude--awesome Christmas card (I always knew there was something ""fishy"" about Santa....)   "
646475,Fisherman,2011-12-08 17:12:00,7201,she must have gotten better skills then.
646481,Harrison,2011-12-08 17:35:00,2202, Looking forward to some reviews of the Nanofil for ice fishing.  The Duracast Tuf-Line is an amazing ice line.
646483,Harrison,2011-12-08 17:37:00,2202, Thanks Dude!
646484,GBW,2011-12-08 17:48:00,8460,I'm glad I have both.  Nanofil #6 size of 2 spooled up and Dura-Cast #10 size of 4
646491,scugpg,2011-12-08 18:02:00,1373,"At that price point I'd be looking at the St Croix ice rods with the selectable spring indicator system! I don't think they are really for huge walleye or lakers, but they are a great rod for smaller walleye and panfish.  Fit it with a spinning reel that has a graphite spool (such as an Abu cardinal series).  http://www.stcroixrods.com/product/legend_ice_rods"
646709,Sinker,2011-12-09 04:50:00,8692," What are you doing to get line twist? I dunno, I've drilled a few holes in my time, and never had any problems with line twisting?? I think I'd rather have the high speed retrieve and smooth drag of a quality spinning reel myself.  S."
646726,dwc67,2011-12-09 11:33:00,140,"i used a flyreel for the first time last season. i could take or leave it  after trying it once in 25ft i would not use it in more then 10- 15ft ever again  for gills in shallow water it's great  i use 1 lb test on a reel with no drag, just a clicker and i have never broke off.    buy a cheap spool of 50lb or higher test to fill the spool so you have some line pick up"
646749,Roy,2011-12-09 13:53:00,13728, A smart line manufacturer would sell that as an advantage.
646774,GBW,2011-12-09 15:02:00,8460,"ok, someone just give me a fly reel then to test this out.  mine's at the cottage burried away in the back of the boathouse and I can't get at it because the boat's now in there too.  then after a trip or two or three on the ice I'll report back as to how it did.  that and I need Phil to get me a Fenwick ice rod to ""demo"" with it too..."
646795,Leecher,2011-12-09 15:34:00,7832," Sinclair, to avoid line twist... just tie a small barrel swivel between your main line and lead     That's what I do and works fine"
646799,Leecher,2011-12-09 15:41:00,7832, LOL OK
646811,kickingfrog,2011-12-09 16:18:00,8333,My it's very nature a spinning reel puts a twist in line every time you reel up.
646824,GBW,2011-12-09 17:03:00,8460,"what, no takers offering to get/give me a fly reel then to try this out with?  LOL"
646825,Terry,2011-12-09 17:12:00,14456,"I can say 100% confidence , because I have spent hours and hours watching lures with an underwater camera that perch(that are not suicidal) will not bite a lure like a rapala ice jig when it is spinning around because of line twist I have also notice that many perch will hit a swivel so put it as far away from the lure as you can"
646828,Spiel,2011-12-09 17:19:00,9065," I'll give you this one Geoff, not sure if it's missing any parts......   "
646829,GBW,2011-12-09 17:20:00,8460,so much for me helping you with the ice hut this weekend...  HAHAHAHA  I've got something for you...  
645982,GBW,2011-12-06 22:59:00,8460,"Hey all.  I'm looking at maybe adding to the Christmas wish list with a new frabill straight line ice combo.  the reel looks like a fly or centerpin reel but it does have drag built in.  anyone hold one and play with it yet?  I know the odds of someone doing real testing with it yet is slim but no harm in asking I guess.  the reel is said to reduce line twist and after jigging all day for pan fish I can see it being a big plus but just not to sure.  so comments and thoughts are welcome (other wise I wouldn't have posted it)  PS, Christmas is coming and I know there are many of you out there that maybe forgot to ask me what I can use or would like...  thanks.  Geoff"
646005,mercman,2011-12-07 00:56:00,7054,  I didn't forget
646012,GBW,2011-12-07 01:45:00,8460,arrgghhh....   LOL!
646017,mercman,2011-12-07 01:54:00,7054,  I'm such a tease !!!!
646023,dhickey,2011-12-07 02:23:00,1038,Ice woks for me  Please Santa?
646031,skeeter,2011-12-07 02:44:00,1907,Xmas list ! how about a new spandex suit with a cape? Or a date with Bridget the midget?
646045,mercman,2011-12-07 02:56:00,7054,"  If he doesnt want the date, can i have it Skeets?"
646050,dhickey,2011-12-07 03:08:00,1038,  Flat head???????maby.
646102,Billy Bob,2011-12-07 10:46:00,5865,Were you GOOD....
646126,Fishnwire,2011-12-07 13:33:00,983,I want one.  If the guy here in town doesn't have too ridiculous a mark-up on them I'll buy one from him...otherwise I'll order it.  Ask for my opinion in a month or so.
646132,Roy,2011-12-07 13:57:00,13728,"Geoff, it looks good to me except that I find it on the pricey side. The reason they say it reduces line twist is only because it's a direct line feed like a baitcaster and not a spinning reel. I just looked at it again.....it's not pricey, it's dang expensive for what it is. But I'm sure it'll sell."
646142,Pikeslayer,2011-12-07 14:38:00,1443,
646153,Fisherman,2011-12-07 15:11:00,7201," Okay, so where do you know Bridgitte the Midget from? She got married a number of years ago."
646162,cheaptackle,2011-12-07 15:41:00,849,Just looked at it on Cabelas.ca - 70.00 pre-tax & shipping! I've sold quite a few discounted fly reels to guys wanting them for just that application.  I thought they were ill advised at best but the customer is always right! Now that I see this I'm thinking maybe they were ahead of their time.    Time to go thru my stock again and get a bunch more ready!  Pretty sure you'd get the same effects & performance for a lot less money.  Thanks for the tip!  Michael
646217,GBW,2011-12-07 18:34:00,8460,to bad my fly rod'n reel are at the cottage...
646225,Nipfisher,2011-12-07 18:55:00,2449,I run fly reels on all my tip-ups. When a fish pulls down the tip it can run with the line.   Here is a picture of one of my tip-ups in front of my old hut.  
646230,DOS,2011-12-07 19:15:00,119,"Yes they are pricey,  it is a small centerpin reel on a ML rod.  I have seen them, I have some orderd for the store but only because a few have requested them.  I can't see many stores carrying much stock but they do look neet.  I would be worried about setting the hook and having it birds nest on ya or when ya toss it down to land the fish having it spool out...  I like the idea of the fly reel on a rod, at least then ya got a drag...  RED"
646238,registerfly,2011-12-07 19:29:00,198,"it's pricey and if you have had a chance to play with it, the reel is how should I say? Kinda cheap, actually really cheap. You're better off using your own fly reel maybe a 3 weight should be fine. That's what my son is doing for one rig. Using his orvis CFO."
646240,Harrison,2011-12-07 19:32:00,2202,"Geoff, wait till Sin get his hands on something tonight.  It should change your mind,"
646243,Roy,2011-12-07 19:34:00,13728,"The happy news is that seeing as they're trying to make them look like a pin to sell them for more, we'll be seeing lots of them pictured next to fish in this winter's ice reports."
646247,Harrison,2011-12-07 19:39:00,2202, Half in the hole with a snow flake beside it.
646255,GBW,2011-12-07 20:10:00,8460,aw man...
646256,kickingfrog,2011-12-07 20:14:00,8333,A 1:1 ratio would be soooo much fun on  Simcoe in 100 foot of water. lol
646257,fishnsled,2011-12-07 20:21:00,3520," I should dust off the Orvis for the ice fishing season, Maybe I'll remove the floating line first though. Actually I've got an old fly reel my Dad gave me before he passed away. Might give it a go with that."
646258,Roy,2011-12-07 20:23:00,13728," HA! That hadn't even crossed my mind, Rob."
