647807,Sinker,2011-12-13 00:39:00,8692,"Well, our hut is bigger, and lighter, and its lasted 15 yrs so far, so I must be doing something right!! Never had any issues whatsoever with moving it.  What are you going to do when the snow is too deep to drive to it?? Have fun with that!!  It will happen, trust me. I've been there, done that, and it sucks with a tank of a hut.  I'm not bashing you, or cutting down your job, I'm simply trying to offer advice from my own BAD experiences. I've had a hut on scugog for over 20 yrs, I've seen all kinds of crazy stuff out there!  The offer still stands if you need a hand!!  S."

How did you ever fit in that thing? It's pretty small. Looks like it couldn't lift an ice cube never mind an ice hut."
648602,Billy Bob,2011-12-15 13:39:00,5865," Hey Nip,  You would have been right 6 months back....but since then I'm down 30 lbs...  And your right again (don't let your wife here that)...that is only a toy picture since I couldn't find a real one...but it's close to the real thing...only our ""Steam Crane"" had 3 lines where this toy version is missing the ""whip line""....a very useful but dangerous lifting device.  Too bad cell phones and portable video devices were not available back then....I would have a fantastic library of video showing how many thought was going to be a impossible job for our wrecking crews....one of our biggest jobs, but far from the toughest I recall is spending 3 days in Rochester because 40 empty coal cars pile up on TOP of each other....if they were loads we might be still there....LOL....still collecting OVERTIME....  Now about that Ice Resort...any finish time scheduled....at least you're getting LOTS of extra time with this kind of weather..."

I have NEVER built a ice hut and would probably have the same tendencies you guys are having...build it big and STRONG as that is how I am....but you really need to think LIGHT LIGHT and LIGHTER on the ice...  But I can help you move it with my RR experience as that was my job for 30 years....putting VERY heavy RR cars back on track.... here's just one of the cranes (similar) I operated. The one we had lifted 250 ton and was manned by a 8 man crew, which included a diner car, sleeping quarters and a tool car...sometimes we  would work around the clock for DAYS...if we couldn't lift it, it couldn't be lifted.....so PLEASE keep it under 250 tons as my experience doesn't help after that weight....LOL  "

647575,DanD,2011-12-12 12:13:00,2223,"For windows and doors, I suggest going to an RV/house trailer style; the windows crank open and the doors are insulated, all made from lightweight aluminum. Most of the larger RV dealers have some form of scrap yard; that these should be easily found and at a good price. I just googled RV salvage parts and got all kinds of hits for places. Why I said doors (plural) is that putting a door at both ends of the hut makes life so much easier; when it’s filled to capacity. We’ve all likely been there; the guy that always seems the need to get out, is sitting the farthest from the door. Plus with your design of the centre LARGE hole; somebody’s going swimming, as they’re tiptoeing around lines and poles to get out.  Dan."

647629,mercman,2011-12-12 15:53:00,7054,That cut out for the holes is a great idea.Thats the way they do it up this way.Take a chainsaw and cut the hole in the ice the same size as the opening in the floor Then build a frame above the hole and hang a bunch of lines down into the water

647646,GbayGiant,2011-12-12 17:00:00,1780,Don't fool yourself into thinking that the wind won't push it around. Ask Rob Hyatt about wind and bungalows disappearing after a good wind storm. Conditions will dictate when you can and can’t move that thing around.
647654,mercman,2011-12-12 17:21:00,7054," http://ouellette001.com/vivre/028vivre.htm  Check this out. we did this a few years back. What do you think about putting the cut out along an outside wall, that way you would have all that room to move around."

647666,adolson,2011-12-12 17:58:00,783,"So much effort put into building one of those... Couldn't you just buy a port-a-potty and drill your hole through the toilet? Lightweight, built-in seating, and when you get a bite, you'll know it."

647320,GBW,2011-12-11 14:16:00,8460,"So I get to Sinclair's dad's cottage yesterday to find a rather large box frame of 2x10's sitting on the floor of the garage.  we decide what's the front and back and where things are going so we get set and add the stringers.     we decide that if we add any more wood to this it jst might be a bit to heavy for the 2 of us to get out of the garage so we moved the base outside and did the rest of the floor.       As you can see, the big gap is where the holes will be in the ice and and now is time to get ready to plan the walls.  anyone have old windows that are not broken that we can use to install?  doors too?  Cheers!"
647324,mercman,2011-12-11 14:37:00,7054,"Hope it doesn't snow before you get the walls and roof up. If you cant find windows, use plexiglass, or heavy mil plastic sheeting. As far as a door, be easier to cut it out of the wall panel, and hinge it to the wall. I have some curtains, and a small ottaman if you want to make the place pretty."
647327,GBW,2011-12-11 14:44:00,8460,"each wall is going to be able to be removed so he can stack the hut to move it and store it rather then be a 'big shed in the yard' so to say.  Door, not too worried.  wnidows, I have plexi if needed but rather a small basement size real window if we can get it.  this way we can open it because there is going to be a wood stove in there too.  he just need's one real window and the rest can be plexi."
647330,Billy Bob,2011-12-11 15:02:00,5865,WHY 2X10 for something that will be sitting on the ice....one word....  HEAVY
647331,Fish Farmer,2011-12-11 15:06:00,2234,"Looks great so far, but my concern would be the weight of your hut. If you get into any deep snow??? What are you pulling it with? What lake You putting it on? Hut off dates with early melt down? Make sure you block it up! I had a permanent hut for 30 years on Simcoe,lots of things I learned, believe me. Don't leave anything in your hut that you don't want stolen. Leave your windows open so people can see in. If you don't, I can guarantee the door will be smashed. Plus you could open your hut door to a treat after someone used your hut as a toilet. Don't forget, your hut must be registered if you leave it out. Long Pt Bay, good luck getting it off or getting it out. I hope to see the finished picture, looking good so far."
647332,GBW,2011-12-11 15:10:00,8460,"not sure why he picked 2x10 but it's not that heavy considering the 2 of us walked the base frame out with next to no effort.  trust me, I was shocked how light is was and so were the others working on the cottage.  they thought we would need them to move it but all was well.  mind you Sin and I are HUGE lumberjack 6'6"" and 220LB guys but still...  LOL!"
647333,skeeter,2011-12-11 15:11:00,1907,"What is the size of the hut? What are the walls being made of, 2x8-2x10's? What thickness of plywood?"
647340,RickOnt,2011-12-11 15:29:00,669,"It will be Good!!  2 x 10's will be a little heavy, But sometimes you gotta use what you have, I am sure you young Lads won't let that stop you from having some 'Fun' on the Ice.  Rick"
647347,GBW,2011-12-11 16:09:00,8460,10x10? going to be as thin as we can make them 3/8 or less from what I recall.  I was just there with tools and extra hands and ideas
647348,bushart,2011-12-11 16:09:00,2628,My 1st thought also was heavy  And by all means put that baby on blocks----if that freezes down in the spring ---you'll never pull it out  Course 2 x 10---would make an instant floating dock
647349,GBW,2011-12-11 16:11:00,8460,"he's the young one, lol!  I'm just there as a friend helping out and I do get dib's on using it before any of you OFC'ers do, lol!"
647350,GBW,2011-12-11 16:13:00,8460,"he's got it all planed out.  after all, he has the ""ring"" of a planer.  we are just showing the build as per other posts."
647352,Leecher,2011-12-11 16:26:00,7832,"Genius idea in having a gap in the middle for drilling holes    I like that  Now for the walls... I'd got light, 2"" x 2"" for framing should do... but that's just me  Great job you two   Can't wait to see the final project. Jacques"
647361,Sharkbait22,2011-12-11 16:46:00,297,"Half the fun is building it. 2x10s are heavier than typically used (2x6 and 4s).  But, if you are going to go heavy the floor and skis are the right place.  I’d like to see how the modular build goes.  Remember to tie it down when on the ice so she doesn’t blow away. Reflectors are a nice touch too."
647383,Billy Bob,2011-12-11 18:18:00,5865,Might as do it right and get a nice window and what's better then a Bay Window on the lake....LOL   Wouldn't this make more sense....  Cut out the floor and put in doors on the floor....this way you can drive it to the next hot spot...   Now we're talking mobile ice fishing hut.....  and it will probably be lighter.....
647392,Fishnwire,2011-12-11 18:59:00,983,"Cool design.  I wonder though just how warm inside you're going to be able to get with that much ice surface exposed.  I had a lot of people tell me that the 8x12 I'm building is going to be ""too heavy""...maybe they're right, I guess I'll know by next spring."

647407,Fishnwire,2011-12-11 19:47:00,983,"2x3s every 24 inches and 1/4 plywood glued and screwed is what I used.  Two guys can pick up a completed 12x8 wall no problem, but it has little flex."
647420,Sinker,2011-12-11 20:19:00,8692,"Think LIGHT!! Trust me!!!  What are you moving it with??  Build a sturdy floor, and keep all the rest as light as possible. 2x2 framing with metal exterior is best in my experience, then insulate with 2"" closed cell foam, or spray foam.  Do you have a sleigh to move that thing on?  Its hilarious at the end of ice season on scugog watching guys trying to get thier huts off. I pull up to mine, back the trailer up to it, hook it to the winch on the trailer, push a little button, and away it goes. Throw a strap front and back and away I go. One man show, with an 8x10 ice hut in tow. No need to call in all my buddies for help, no need to worry about it being frozen in.....takes me about 10 mins to put it on the trailer MYSELF! I can also push it with one hand myself if I want to just move it a little closer to the hot hole  It doesn't need to be sturdy, it needs to be light, and easy to move around!!! Ask me how I know.....I've had several heavy huts, and I learned my lessons the hard way!!!  S."

647527,Sinker,2011-12-12 02:21:00,8692,"Bottom line is its gonna be heavy! I'm guessing at least 1000lbs.  If you need a hand moving it around, let me know.  Do you have a sleigh for it? I don't see any type of ski's built into the floor? You just going to trailer it around?   S."
647546,GBW,2011-12-12 04:23:00,8460,hey now!  good idea though...     he is going to make bunks in it.  he's got his full size Chev truck and my wife's uncle is 17 doors down if we need a sled. But cheers for the offer!!! G
