646456,Photoz,2011-12-08 15:20:00,792,"I bought the FL20 Ultra Pack 3 years ago, used it a total of 5 times the first year, then last year I didn't get out at all. I've generally put it on 'charge' every 4  -  5 months . . .   and it was STILL about 80% charged. Last year I forgot all about it . . . .   last charge was in January 2011. I plugged it in and . . . .    PRESTO . . . .    STILL 40% charged? it took about 6 hours for the green light showing 'full charge' to come on? Once there's ice, and I get out there, will this be accurate or can I expect only a few hours outta it before it goes flat? How dependible are these square 9 volt batteries if you let 'em go nearly flat. Does a year between charges sound possible? Just gettin' over a knee replacement . . . .   hopefully it'l be 'all haired up and healed over' by late January . . . .   when Simcoe is ready for us? (My money is on January 27.)"
646460,mike rousseau,2011-12-08 15:38:00,4661,every time i put the charger on to keep it charged... always shows full charge...  i put the charger on 2-3 times during softwater..... every time it showed full charge... my vex ultra is stored in my house where its warm... dont know if that help the battery or not...    why dont you try letting it run all day and see how long it lasts?  ive heard its bad to run your transducer dry... so id hang that in a bucket of water maybe?  or buy a new battery...  dan bouck has some for sale for 20 bucks... if your really worried just buy a new battery... 20 bucks isnt much...  http://ontariofishingcommunity.com/forums/index.php?showtopic=57768&st=0

649106,gone_fishin,2011-12-17 09:12:00,481, funny... i just pulled mine out a couple days ago to top-up the battery. hadn't pulled it outta the closet since putting it away in march... still read 100% and the green light came on as soon as i plugged it in. i guess i'm ready for some ice! haha
