648621,Skipper D,2011-12-15 14:30:00,1970,"Have friend next time Mike show up just before you come off the water , that way a good chase wont be lost if you know what i mean ."
648631,ch312,2011-12-15 15:32:00,1590," maybe not, but making a call to 911 to report a careless and possibly drunk driver is fully legal on your part. some simple questioning by mr copper could lead to being busted with stolen merchandise, drugs, dui, stolen car, no license/insurance, etc. ""yes, i believe there is a drunk person following me that is swerving all over the road and has nearly ran into my boat twice"".  with my zero tolerance for crap like this and knowing full well the cops cant/won't do anything, confronting them before i made it home would definitely cross my mind more than once."
648632,Billy Bob,2011-12-15 15:35:00,5865,Don't know your laws up there but here a cop needs just cause to pull someone over.
648633,bushart,2011-12-15 15:37:00,2628,Billy Bob---Up here they just need a NY State licence plate
648634,Roy,2011-12-15 15:45:00,13728,"I don't worry about such things. To my knowledge, I've never been followed. And, Revenue Quebec aside, I don't recall ever having been robbed in my entire life."
648635,Billy Bob,2011-12-15 15:46:00,5865," HEY, I resemble that remark....."
648637,Harrison,2011-12-15 16:01:00,2202," That's what I am saying Mikie, it probably wasn't the coppers.  It was other officers."
648638,mike rousseau,2011-12-15 16:08:00,4661, I wish...  Off the top of my head...  My brothers R6 Yamaha motorbike stolen  Dads truck cleaned out  House was robbed 3 times... Once while I was home... The skumbag walked into my bedroom while I was playing video games in my tighty whiteys (I was 15)  My car broken into...$600 in stuff stolen  Bow mount electric stolen off my boat in my driveway at night while we were sleeping  Canoe stolen from our cottage  And boathouses cleaned out one winter  And recently local kids have taken up car baseball...  They go around smashing mirrors off cars and breaking windshields for fun... They got my mom and uncle in the same night...  Transducer kicked off the back of my boat  Etc....
648639,Billy Bob,2011-12-15 16:13:00,5865," Mikey,  You probably don't need me to say this....BUT....you need to live in a better neighbourhood....don't you think....  I'm twice your age....  and the only thing I EVER had stolen from me was my HUGE rotary antenna off the roof of my cottage back in 1982 and I pretty sure I know who done it.  I have NEVER even locked the door on my garage in the 30+ years I have lived here....and wouldn't lock the house doors if my wife would let me.  Bob"
648640,mike rousseau,2011-12-15 16:19:00,4661,This is between 3 different properties...  It's all the coked out low life's in my area... Everyone is a drug dealer...  Looking out the window I see 2 drug dealer houses... And I live in a good area...
648644,bushart,2011-12-15 16:25:00,2628,What village we livin in there Mike?  May circle that puppy on my road map
648645,Billy Bob,2011-12-15 16:26:00,5865,When you look out your window this time of the day you should be seeing empty driveways because those folks are working and the kids are in school....you might want to think about that....expensive rent/mortgages most times dictate the neighbours you have....just like a cheap hotel vs a more expensive hotel when travelling in unknown areas...always spend the little more to insure safety and piece of mind for you and your family.  Now go out there and kick the drug dealers   and throw a RR fuse through the window before you head out for lunch....  Bob
648649,Rod Caster,2011-12-15 16:30:00,5784," No need to travel, there must be a d.d. in your local area."
648658,bushart,2011-12-15 16:40:00,2628,thinkin more in the avoidance vein there RC
648661,mike rousseau,2011-12-15 16:49:00,4661,   Lol
648666,Skipper D,2011-12-15 17:05:00,1970," Yup , same as in the 1970's , thats why we move away Mike ."
648668,mike rousseau,2011-12-15 17:08:00,4661,Youve read my fishing reports... I'm not going anywhere...  Just need a house with a very big garage to store all my stuff...
648670,Skipper D,2011-12-15 17:13:00,1970,LOL ....... ST Andrews is quite.......... lol .
648672,Skipper D,2011-12-15 17:16:00,1970,"Better yet Mike , second town as you head out of town to the west , all baptist , very quite neibour hood ."
648489,mike rousseau,2011-12-15 02:02:00,4661,I was recently followed  from the local boat launch...  The car in question was waiting at the launch after dark for me to return... And left right behind me... Luckily I was paying attention and noticed this right away...  So on the way home I took a few turns that make no sence and the car kept following...  So we decided to go down a one way street so I could stop and block the road with my truck and boat to confront this skumbag... That was the turn they didn't make...  Either they figured out we were testing them or they knew my boat would be somewhere in the next few blocks... They almost came to a stop watching us drive down the road...   I thought I'd share this with everyone  I was lucky enough to spot these losers... But in the summer with a busy parking lots at the launch... I never would have noticed...  In the past couple years I've had fishing gear stolen a couple times including my bow mount trolling motor and over $500 in lures... As well as my digital camera with all my fishing pics...  So consider this a heads up... Look both ways and over you shoulder when you leave the launch...
648494,Skipper D,2011-12-15 02:19:00,1970,"Mike , could it have been the under cover RCMP checking you out to see if you might be moving smokes ?"
648498,mike rousseau,2011-12-15 02:34:00,4661,Why wouldn't they check us at the launch? Or continue to follow us after a couple unnesasary turns?  I would also hope RCMP would be better at tailing people then sitting in a vacant parking lot... Starting their car after I pull my boat... And pulling out right behind me...  I would hope...
648505,adolson,2011-12-15 02:47:00,783,"Good advice. If that ever happens to me, I'm gonna try to get the plate if possible. Maybe get out at a red light or stop sign and go confront them. Or make an unnecessary turn into the nearest police station. Go stop at Subway and get a fresh footlong turkey breast on whole wheat, and see what they do then. Or just make an O-turn and tail them (maybe tough to do with a boat and trailer, haha). But this probably won't happen to me, since my old canoe sits on top of my car pretty much whenever not in use, and there's rarely ever anyone at any of the lakes I go to. Still, I wouldn't have thought to keep an eye out, so that's good advice for all."
648506,spoon,2011-12-15 02:51:00,74,"Last year, first ice, we found a huge school of whitefish on simcoe. For a week no one else was still fishing whity grounds on simcoe. We came back the next weekend knowing that no one still dared to venture out. Our car was full of ice rods in plane view, 30 min away from simcoe we have a car behind us, we slow down, he slows down, we go around some streets, he follows. I tell my friend that for sure he knows that we are after whitfish because of the area that we are in and to ""loose"" him. We did.  We get back to the area and park, when we were changing a police cruiser pulls up. The car that was following us was driven by a retired police officer and he noticed my friend cross inches of the white line and that this made him suspect something and thats why he followed us. We had a laugh with the officer when I told him the whole story. But it could have been bad for us and could have ruined our day"
648508,OutdoorDan,2011-12-15 02:52:00,325,"I would have made a call to the police in your shoes, confronting them is just going to make them back off until the next opportunity...  I don't think the OPP would take calls of being followed very lightly especially if you described the situation to them.  Glad everything is okay though."
648514,mercman,2011-12-15 02:59:00,7054,Good advice Mike !! Ya cant be too careful.Although it woulda been funny to see the look on his face if you had of gotten out of you F150 and let him get a load of your stature I mean you're not a tiny dude
648515,Skipper D,2011-12-15 03:00:00,1970,"Knowing what i know about what go's on along the river and why the new RCMP office is in town ,  i am sure i would be made to feel uncomfortable every time i put my boat in or out if i lived back there  , i'd call them and see and if it was'nt them , then you could bring them up to speed on what you experiance . You know thease guys work in misterious ways at doing what ever they do . if its the other ..... kick ass !"
648520,bushart,2011-12-15 03:15:00,2628,OK Dana---that made me laugh
648525,mike rousseau,2011-12-15 03:32:00,4661,  Don't be so sure...  One year after a local spring conoe race... The next day our canoe was stolen... We figured someone followed my brother after the race...  Mind you it wasn't strapped to our car...   I'm really trying to point out that most crime isn't random...
648526,Skipper D,2011-12-15 03:38:00,1970,"Just got off the phone with family down there , The're saying the normal crap that go's on has spiked right now like it does at this time of the year . Criminals out seeing what they can get thier hands on to sell to have Christmas money  , apparently its pretty bad right now ."
648531,Dan668,2011-12-15 03:51:00,1120,"My brother has a done up circuit track car, when he comes home at night on the rare occassions he takes the car out you'd be surprised on how many times people follow us into the neighbourhood. We just make random turns and lose them. My truck was in the shop and no cars in the driveway and their was a random checking out my trolling motor on my lund a few weeks ago (I keep the boat right on the front lawn), right when I stepped outside, he sprinted away. What kills me is that this was in broad daylight!  Dirtbags lol"
648532,HTHM,2011-12-15 03:54:00,4082,"My nephew is a Mountie in your neck of the woods Mike, and trust me, if you were being followed by them, you would never know. Probably some rube casing you out."
648534,mike rousseau,2011-12-15 04:01:00,4661,Worst of all... It's not a crime to follow someone...
648547,Dontcryformejanhrdina,2011-12-15 05:02:00,535,My uncle had his boat motor stolen right out of his yard about a month ago when he was in the hospital having surgery. Scumbags are everywhere and will steal anything that's not nailed down.
648550,Live2fish85,2011-12-15 05:26:00,1633,"My house was robbed when I was in my teens. We lived in a small town and there were 4 other houses robbed as well in the block that summer. Every house robbed had camper in the driveway getting ready and when they were gone, that's when they got us. Cops said they probably watched us for weeks, got everything."
648567,Billy Bob,2011-12-15 11:03:00,5865,"OMG......I can't ever let my wife read this....as she's always concerned when we head north to fish the Great White North every summer with my boat and or equipment...  And here I always thought Canadians were the most honest people on the face of the earth...I always leave all my equipment on-board in my boat night and day....and I still have that faith in my good Canadian friends....but there is something to ""out of sight, out of mind"" reasoning when it comes to simple security...  The only theft I have ever incurred in Ontario is my fishing spot once or twice....oh, I almost forgot...there was this Pizza Hut in North Bay (years ago) that charged me like $60 for a pizza  a couple of beers and pop for the kids....now that highway robbery in my eyes... ..for $60 here I could be a co-owner of a pizza place...LOL"
648572,livinisfishin,2011-12-15 11:28:00,661,Brutal..had my outboard stolen this year and now I don't look at any of my stuff in the same way..locked up and covered up.
648575,lew,2011-12-15 11:56:00,12766,"Here's a different but somewhat similar scenario  The Canadian version of Antiques Roadshow was filming an episode in Toronto a few years back and my next door neighbor took an old painting of his down for an appraisal. I forget exactly but it was said to be worth something like $10,000  After the show he put it in the trunk of his car but when he got home it was pouring rain so he left the painting in the trunk so it wouldn't get wet.  He woke in the morning to find the trunk open and the painting gone and figures someone from the show followed him home and stole it when he went in the house."
648599,hirk,2011-12-15 13:35:00,571,"Reminds me of the clowns driving a convertable with the roof made out of a curtain and duct tape lol. When I picked up my boat in the US they followed me for miles on I75,when I changed lanes so did they many times,finally I came to a dead stop in traffic in the center lane and they got the hint and screwed off."
648604,Billy Bob,2011-12-15 13:42:00,5865, We do that all the time just to screw with you C.C's....

648617,Cast-Away,2011-12-15 14:10:00,790,Because he is too busy robbing the hood!
648619,mike rousseau,2011-12-15 14:15:00,4661,  If it was cops ( wich I'm sure it wasn't) it would be RCMP... They cover the smuggling in our area... They even just built a new office in our area...
