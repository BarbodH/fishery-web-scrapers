648756,Pope29,2011-12-15 22:29:00,29,"Hey guys, just relocated back to the area and am looking forward to fishing some old areas and some new ones also.  In Niagara I could usually find bait all year but I have a felling I better get my tank full soon up here. Anyway, was wondering if anyone could tip me off to the whereabouts of some shiners I can dip or trap (pm if you need to keep it quiet).  Thank you,  Pope"
649039,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2011-12-16 23:36:00,0, can't help you if you're looking for emeralds but common shiners and dace are everywhere in creeks around town.
649084,Pope29,2011-12-17 03:49:00,29,I went and tried dipping the St Marys today with no luck. I'll go put a couple traps in the creeks tomorrow I guess. Was thinking the Root and maybe somewhere around Fort Creek.
649174,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2011-12-17 17:49:00,0, The root on the north end of town is a good choice for traps.  davignon creek in the west end is also quite productive.
