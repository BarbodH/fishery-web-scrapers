Apparently, over the course of the last couple days, as many as 15 cottages have been broken into along Hartley Bay rd. Ours was broken into last night.  They even got into Flat Rapids Camp.  Heading up there tommorrow to assess the damage, and deal with the cops.  If any members here have a place up there, see about having a neighbour check on your place.  Hope they can find some leads.  I want to say more, but I won't."

648455,EC1,2011-12-15 00:12:00,930,That really stinks. Hope it wasn't too bad and you'll be able to recover your stuff!  I always joke to my older peers that you don't ever want to have kids because you're making the worst mistake by bringing them into such a scary place.
