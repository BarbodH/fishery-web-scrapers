Looking for any recent info on the above lakes, did a quick search  on the forum, and, found good and bad.  Any other suggestions are appreciated as well.  Looking to spend under $400 for two nights for the two of us. Feel free to PM.  Thanks, Frank"
648226,adempsey,2011-12-14 05:04:00,1498,"Went for a long weekend to Kashagawigamog (I assume that's the lake you mean) back in February.  There were five of us and we rented ice huts from one of the lodges.  Fishing was slow.  We caught some small perch, a couple of musky, couple of herring and a walleye.   Always nice to get out on a new lake, but sometimes it can be tough.    I think it has potential and it's not a very busy lake.  I've been considering Bernard for a while now and we might head up there next season for an annual weekender."

Basically I'm just looking for decent (doesn't have to be great) fishing, with decent accomodations for a two night weekday stay. Boshkung was another lake I was looking at."

Good accommodations and huts, decent mix of fish + many thumbs up from a bunch of you guys and gals. Booked for mid-January...now just need the ice!!!!"
648469,Musky or Specks,2011-12-15 01:07:00,2710,I was going to suggest Everett's Northern Excursions on Restoule with either on ice bungalows or his cabin. Great mix of species and good price with decent to great fishing.
648471,asdve23rveavwa,2011-12-15 01:10:00,2690," I saw that one, but, didn't contact him.  Had a great time camping up there a couple of years ago...pretty tough fishing, actually did better wading of the back of our site, than in the boat. Wasn't sure how the ice fishing would be...may have to do a couple of trips, lol."
