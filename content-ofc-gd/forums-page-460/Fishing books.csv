646284,d_paluch,2011-12-07 22:08:00,343,"that is true  but at the same time I wouldn't mind having something to read that isn't on a monitor. That and I am being hounded by family as to what I want for christmas, so why not get a couple books to help expand my fishing knowledge"
646285,aplumma,2011-12-07 22:10:00,6896,While this is not a book Ontario Fishing Network is not only a great free Emagazine it also is put out by our founder/owner here T.J.Quesnel. It is packed with articles and as a bonus if you LIKE  it you will be entered into a $500.00 prize raffle.   thanks T.J. for a great read and a free contest.   Art

648102,J-M,2011-12-13 22:43:00,65,"If you like to travel to different lakes in Ontario, the fishing Mapbooks aren't too bad. If I've got some extra time on a weekend with my kayak, I'll usually pull out this book and try a new lake close by! The books are divided into regions in Ontario to make it a bit easier. They basically give you bathymetric charts, lake depths, fish species within the lake, hot baits for the lake etc.   http://www.backroadmapbooks.com/main/Fishingmapbooks.html  Cheers"

If I still have them you'd be welcome to them. There was everything there from how to make your own lures to how to make a shore lunch and tips and tricks to catching just about everything that swims. I'll let you know tomorrow."
648123,Skipper D,2011-12-13 23:54:00,1970,  You never heard of my book Drifter ?
648145,DRIFTER_016,2011-12-14 00:51:00,10439,  I have a copy.
648157,Skipper D,2011-12-14 01:05:00,1970,"  wife gave me mine for my birthday this year in lou of me taking up fishing , i like the knot pages ........lol ."
648192,johnl,2011-12-14 02:32:00,197,"''the freshwater angler'' has a few Successful walleye fishing and Northern pike and muskie are both good ones.You can get them at wal-mart , I thing they make a bass one aswell."
648193,kickingfrog,2011-12-14 02:39:00,8333,"Another option would be books about fishing and fishermen. John Gierach has some books that I really enjoy. Not technical, just fishing stories."
648218,DRIFTER_016,2011-12-14 04:13:00,10439, I have all of Gierach's books too.
648247,EC1,2011-12-14 12:21:00,930,"KVD Bass strategies has been a good read for me. Debunks fishing ""myths"" and gives some pretty good tips about bass. I'm not finished reading yet, but worth the 20 bucks."
648279,Beans,2011-12-14 14:17:00,3339,"I gave my son a copy of ""Fishing for Dummies""  Gotta admit it was a good read..."
648300,Big Cliff,2011-12-14 15:12:00,6899,"Sorry, I just checked and Sue had given the ones I had to the library for their book sale. I guess she figured I already knew everything LOL."
648317,jimmer,2011-12-14 16:04:00,2730,"""The Last Guide"" a story about Frank Kuiack a guide in the Algonquin region, written by an Ottawa author. Great read that covers most of the 20th century. Easy read and enjoyable. Check online for places to find it. The Mike Iaconelli Story ""Fishing on the Edge"", a buddy said it was pretty good. He is a tournament angler from the States. Just a couple that might be worth checking out. Might be nice to get away from the technique part of fishing. That stuff can get repetative."
648486,gordy28,2011-12-15 01:52:00,638, Loved the Last Guide Anything by Roderick Haig Brown (founder if the tyee club) Fish Fights is a good read -about a guy who spends 18 months fishing for a variety of salt water fish (and 1 lm bass) in florida I got the Great Book of Bass for Christmas last year its a good reference/instruction book Finally in my opinion anything in the In Fisherman Critical Concepts series is worth a read
