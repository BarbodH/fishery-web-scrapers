645233,mike rousseau,2011-12-04 02:05:00,4661,Well I'm around 900 walleye this year with several over 9lbs... But I had no 10 pounders... This was driving me bananas!!!!!!!!  So I saw a chance to hit quinte today with my brother... Good idea...  Lines were in around 730 am...  Board fired around 800 am... Sweet... First fish on lead core....  Get the fish up to the transom... Pig... 10lb 8oz of quinte gold...        After that it was a bit downhill...  Snagged a perch...  I dropped 2 fish...  Brother dropped 1 fish...  Then late afternoon we boated another eye around 4lbs...  No matter how you look at it... It was a good trip... Time with my brother... 10lb walleye... And great weather in December...   Anybody else hit quinte this weekend?

645259,fishinguypat,2011-12-04 04:59:00,547,Is it just me or is it's eye ridiculously big  Nice catch though!
645265,adolson,2011-12-04 05:49:00,783,Look at the size of that eye of that eye!
645280,superdad,2011-12-04 12:41:00,353,Congrats on the PB.  That fish sure looked bigger than 10.5lbs.  David  aka  Superdad
645299,mike rousseau,2011-12-04 14:15:00,4661, Unless the scale was frozen/stiff...  Took and hour to free up my frozen throttle assembly... Under the cowling... Luckily the motor was able to troll till it was sorted out...
645302,Rod Caster,2011-12-04 14:18:00,5784,must have come from deeper water...  Your on a roll Mike!
645394,fishindevil,2011-12-04 22:38:00,6254,.congrats on breaking 10....what depth did you get him from??? his eyes are gonna pop out???
645423,mike rousseau,2011-12-05 00:43:00,4661,Not sure how deep I was running...  I don't have a trolling bible...  But I saw the fish streak down to 30-40 after the release... So I think it was ok...
645424,Rizzo,2011-12-05 00:51:00,4754, gotta love good electronics! Congrats on a great fish

645483,Guest chase4chrome,2011-12-05 12:32:00,0,"I'm a dedicated stream fisherman, but if I have to see more boffo musky/walleye reports I'll have to go out and buy a boat and join you guys...  Keep it up gents"
645499,Lunkerhunter,2011-12-05 14:02:00,455,awesome fish mike. im off to quinte this coming weekend for 4 days. last kick at the can for quinte walleye for me this year. hopefully its a good one.
645707,Dontcryformejanhrdina,2011-12-06 00:02:00,535,Awesome catch! The eyes on that fish are hilariously huge.    Certainly makes me regret putting the boat away for the winter already with how mild it's been here.
645711,misfish,2011-12-06 00:28:00,29133,My eyes went like that once. But I was underage at a certian club. Draft was 75 cents.
646099,limeyangler,2011-12-07 10:39:00,5204,Congrats Mike...an awesome specimen...i will have to visit the BOQ for sure!
646224,cityfisher,2011-12-07 18:49:00,959,right on !! the eye has one huge EYE!
646466,Headhunter,2011-12-08 15:55:00,5703,"There is a reason why most guys won't track lures below 30 ft... Outside of it's eye ball trying it's hardest to escape that fishes body, it looks like a nice clean Quitne eye... HH"
646474,mike rousseau,2011-12-08 16:55:00,4661," Yeah... I gotta get the ""trolling bible"" so I know how deep I'm fishing..."
