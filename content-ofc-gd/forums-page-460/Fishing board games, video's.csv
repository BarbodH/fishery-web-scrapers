I watched peolpe play the nascar thing a time or two . Sitting here now with winter ahead i  thought , what if , a fishing game that could be played on computer , better yet on a web site with friends as a pass time thru the winter months . A game sorts like the nascar game but for fishing in the same way its played , pick your lake or river , pick your boat , rod , bait , lure , fishing buddy ect ...  I think it would be better if it could be played with a large number people at the same time tho . If there is not such a thing i would be interested in getting together with a few guys sharing ideas and inventing one . Then may be this could just be a stupid thought , then again may be theres some money to be made  ?"

I own the Walleye tournament board, its a trivia game that is set up like a walleye tournament highest amount of fish at weigh-in wins basically.  I love it but sadly most don't want to join me in playing the game at the cottage. I am going to a father/son/boys ice fishing weekend at the end of January and am thinking I will bring it."

It's probably the best fishing game I've played, and even has a special controller with it:            Considering the ice has decided to come and go and who knows if it's coming back, I may have to dust this thing off, myself."
