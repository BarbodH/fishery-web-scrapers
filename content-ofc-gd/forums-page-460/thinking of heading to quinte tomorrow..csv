646299,hunter/fisher,2011-12-07 23:00:00,7,I am thinking of heading to quinte tomorrow.  The are calling for 30 winds i only have a 14foot do you thing it will be to rough?  The only reason i ask is i live in hamilton and don't want to drive all of that way for rough conditions.

646377,WalleyeSlayer,2011-12-08 03:40:00,26,30km/h in a 14footer on quinte .. I would not take it out there if your travelling from hamilton to face dissappointments. You could take cover in lee's and calmer water away from the wind but its better to hold off for a better day. Just my opinion.    Aadil  
646403,fishindevil,2011-12-08 11:59:00,6254,"if you even need to ask knowing their is going to be minimun 30k winds,in a 14ft tinny..."
646405,Guest chase4chrome,2011-12-08 12:06:00,0,    You gotta know Aadil is B. of Quinte go-to-guy....I'd stay home bro.
646430,Headhunter,2011-12-08 13:45:00,5703,Launch in Picton and stay in Picton Bay and you will be fine... just don't venture too far out into the area east of the cement plant... that will lead to trouble! HH
