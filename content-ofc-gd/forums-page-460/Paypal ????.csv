648294,GBW,2011-12-14 14:44:00,8460,"your reply.  I do not have a paypal account nor do I intend on creating one just for this sale.  I only deal with cash and I have already told you my final price.  If you are not happy with this I will contact the 2nd person that has offered to buy ____ from me.  I have asked them to hold on to see what happens between you and me first.  So before the other people decide they are no longer interested I need to know your answer.  the person picking it up can bring the cash, that works too because I would guess you trust them.  If I do not hear from you in 24 hours I will take it that you are no longer interested.  Woohoo!  Thanks Lew!"
648295,GBW,2011-12-14 14:47:00,8460,I agree Phil. but I wrote out my reply for Lew to test the person if he want's to
648296,lew,2011-12-14 14:48:00,12766," That's funny Geoff, your reply is darned near word for word what I told him last night.  I doubt I'll hear back from him but we'll see what happens."
648298,GBW,2011-12-14 14:54:00,8460,
648306,BillM,2011-12-14 15:26:00,17367,"Lew, when the buyer doesn't mention your item specifically, and just refers to it as 'the item' or something similar.  It's an absolute scam....  I use Paypal all the time and have never had an issue, but never for big ticket items (My biggest purchase using it was just under $1000)..."
648312,danbouck,2011-12-14 15:33:00,4380,"I use paypal a lot but only for ebay and actual stores, like Toys r us online last night. No way I would use it for kijiji"
648314,adempsey,2011-12-14 15:38:00,1498,"Paypal can also do cash transfer.  I've done that with a sale on a used item in the past.  Anyway, definitely bogus given the generality of the message.  Personally, if cash in hand wasn't an option, I'd just ask for an e-mail bank transfer.  I do them all the time.  Very fast and easy to do, as long as you bank online anyway."
648315,John,2011-12-14 15:40:00,2956,"Lew, when selling on Kijiji, go by a well worn statement..........  ""In God we trust, the rest pay cash""!  No doubt that reply has ""run"" written all over it. Kijiji is a great place to sell stuff but it's still a little like the wild west as far as law and order."
648319,Headhunter,2011-12-14 16:07:00,5703,Doesn't Paypal charge fees for transactions? HH
648321,cheaptackle,2011-12-14 16:09:00,849,"I believe on a transaction the seller is charged and the buyer is not, but not sure if there's charges for just having the account?  Michael"
648322,Harrison,2011-12-14 16:13:00,2202," There is a fee to accept the funds.  Nothing for the sender.  There are no account fees for a regular paypal account.  But you willbe charged a fee to withdraw the funds to a bank account if under $150, no fee if you withdraw more is my understanding.  An email money transfer is a great option.  Some retailers accept this as a payment method as well. I do.  There is a 1.50 fee charge to the person sending the transfer however."
648325,cuzza,2011-12-14 16:16:00,467,"Paypal charges the payer a fee and the recipient will be charged to transfer the cash out of Paypal to another account. If you leave it in there you can then use it for other purchases.  As others have said lew, that email is scam-tacular!"
648331,lew,2011-12-14 17:04:00,12766,"Not to worry guys, as I said at the top I ONLY  use cash, no matter whether I'm buying or selling anything.  I've just never used Paypal before and didn't know how it worked on these types of transactions."
648342,corvette1,2011-12-14 17:51:00,1765,lew i thing everyone uses paypal on e-bay because e-bay owns paypal thats what i heard
648345,Gregoire,2011-12-14 18:11:00,1397,It is my understanding that paypal deducts a percantage of each transaction from the sale price. (I think it is 3%). This amount comes out of the sellers account. I am under the impression that this is quite a profitable business; so much so that there seems to be some competition in the market. I read an article about a new company recent that charges a flat fee of 25 cents per transaction.
648351,wallyboss,2011-12-14 18:30:00,1095,"I was contacted by somebody with a similar story.  He said that he will pay my paypal account and he will get his buddy to drop in and pickup what he had bought.   I told him ""How about you send the money to his paypals account and then he can cash it and hand me cash when he comes and picks it up.""  Never heard from hom again."
648419,adolson,2011-12-14 22:17:00,783,"I had the same sort of thing happen when I listed some things on North Bay Classifieds a few years back. Almost the exact same wording, too, complete with the same stupid question about price - clearly indicated in the ad! Except instead of PayPal, it was Western Union.  I told him I would only take cash and to give me his address and I would personally deliver it to him. He insisted on Western Union. I insisted on cash and in person. That's where it ended. It was painfully obvious it was a scam.  Now, if I was selling something and the guy simply asked if I'd take PayPal, and sounded like a normal human being, I'd entertain the thought, possibly put some conditions such as the money has to clear and the shipping address and name has to match, etc. In general, PayPal is fairly safe, but I have only used it to buy things online and sell on eBay, as well as receive payments for minor side consultations for some guy in the US that considers me his Linux guru.  Interac Email Money Transfers are still my preferred method of accepting payments, though. I've had people rip me off in person because I was too trusting and figured they handed me the full amount ($20) when they actually handed me a rolled up ten and a rolled up five inside... For example. EMTs, I can see the amount beforehand, it's deposited immediately, no fuss, no muss. But that's just me."
648865,RSF,2011-12-16 07:20:00,47,I've been using Paypal for about five years now without any problems. I'm noticing more and more retail stores are accepting PP and that's a good thing. As your not giving out your credit card info on line and have the option w/PP of setting up your account that you may select either paying from your bank account or credit card and PP takes care of the payment securely for you.  
648903,bigbuck,2011-12-16 14:50:00,2449,"IN GOD I TRUST, ALL OTHERS PAY C A S H! ! ! Or C.O.B. = Cash on the Barrelhead"
648260,lew,2011-12-14 13:34:00,12766,I always deal in cash and although I've heard of Paypal I don't know how it works.  I have an item listed for sale on kijiji and a possible buyer wants to pay me with Paypal and then arrange for someone to pickup it up.....doesn't sound good to me.  I told him it has to be a cash deal only but I'm just curious how this works and is it actually legit  How does a person get their money ??  Anybody deal this way ??
648261,GBW,2011-12-14 13:37:00,8460,I use paypal for ebay Lew.  It's quick and easy and its done with a credit card.  they pay you X$ on the credit card you sign up with from the credit card they have.  if the deal goes South for any reason you go back to paypal and get your cash back from them.  IE the card used was a fake.
648262,cheaptackle,2011-12-14 13:37:00,849,Paypal is NOT something to use on Kijiji - read the site recommendations and it says so.  Third party pick up with Paypal is usually a scam - protect yourself and deal in cash only!  Michael
648263,crappieperchhunter,2011-12-14 13:38:00,2582,I'm no help Lew...but I'm sure others will chime in. I can tell you Pay Pal is 100% legit. Guys at work use it all the time with no issues.
648266,lew,2011-12-14 13:47:00,12766," Thanks guys, it'll definetely be a cash deal for me.  I know people use it to purchase items from stores but I'm old fashioned and like the feel of the $$$$ in my mitt before I hand over the merchandise."
648267,GBW,2011-12-14 13:48:00,8460,don't blame you one bit Lew.
648268,lew,2011-12-14 13:50:00,12766," Geoff, in your 1st reply, do I understand that both the buyer and seller would have a paypal account and the buyer would transfer the money into the sellers account ??"
648269,motion,2011-12-14 13:51:00,403," That is a wise decision Lew. Though I use Paypal to purchase goods over the net, I would never accept it as payment for goods sold. Here is the link right from Kijiji that gives you a few examples of the scams using Paypal out there:  http://help.kijiji.net/ca/knowledgebase.php?article=85  Any look familiar?"
648272,lew,2011-12-14 14:02:00,12766,"Thanks for that link motion, hard to believe some folks actually fall for some of those scams."
648275,GBW,2011-12-14 14:14:00,8460,correct Lew.  hence you are protected by papal's insurance if the person is trying to defraud you with a fake card.
648277,GBW,2011-12-14 14:15:00,8460,"with that said, if it's more then $100 ask for the cash."
648278,asdve23rveavwa,2011-12-14 14:17:00,2690,"Good advice from the guys.  Paypal is fantastic for Ebay purchases, but, I agree with the majority...for kijiji...get cash."
648280,lew,2011-12-14 14:18:00,12766,"Thanks Geoff, cash is always King !!"
648281,Harrison,2011-12-14 14:20:00,2202," Hey Lew, I would never touch a deal through Kijiji where paypal is involved.  Wise decision.  As for paypal it basically works like this.  It is like an online bank account.  You can load it with either a credit card or through an online transfer from your regular bank account. Your email address is you paypal account number.  Once you have an account you can transfer money to other peoples accounts via their email addresses. So if I bought your boat for example.  It ws 20,000 bucks and your paypal account email was [email protected] I could put 20,000 in my account, click the send money button, put [email protected] in the address space, hit send and you have the money in your account.  You can then withdraw those funds and they will end up in your CIBC/TD/RBC or what bank account in a few days.  You do not have to have a paypal account to use paypal.  For example, at my online store you can check out with paypal as a guest using your credit card.  No account needed.  This is how you got that reel from me.  SO you've already used paypal before! ha!  If you buy alot online or through ebay, a Paypal account makes things alot faster and easier.  Hope this clears it up a bit for ya Lew, I was a lil rushed, hope it makes sense."
648282,woodenboater,2011-12-14 14:21:00,2277,"I only use Paypal with people I trust not to back out and file a claim. Email Interac is another option and is safer for the seller I believe but when in doubt, Tim Hortons with cash in hand is the safest for all involved."
648283,motion,2011-12-14 14:21:00,403," Lew, just watch out for them new Canadian $100 bills.......they're plastic.  Cheers,  Tony"
648284,GBW,2011-12-14 14:22:00,8460,"look at you, kiss     HAHAHA"
648286,Harrison,2011-12-14 14:26:00,2202, have you seen his boat?
648287,lew,2011-12-14 14:28:00,12766," Thanks guys, and Phil, I like your style"
648288,lew,2011-12-14 14:30:00,12766," Sorry Phil, we were posting at the same time.  That $20.000 you spoke of earlier will get you the motor and 1 paddle....we'll negotiate further for the rest of the package   :lol:"
648289,GBW,2011-12-14 14:35:00,8460,not yet but I hope to one day
648290,lew,2011-12-14 14:38:00,12766,"For anyone who may be interested, this was the reply I got from the person who claims to be interested in what I'm selling.  +++++++++++++  Thanks for your reply,i just wanted to make sure all bases are covered !I'm satisfied with the condition but how long have you owned it?? and what's your lowest price for it. I love a bargain, so i would like to get it as soon as i can.I would be able to make payment through paypal, i find it the easiest way to use my credit card safely and is a safe and reliable method of payment... Let me know your price for it .I hope to hear from you soon, and i will make all transportation preparations for the it to be transported to my home  +++++++++++++"
648291,lew,2011-12-14 14:39:00,12766, Your welcome in my boat anytime Geoff
648292,Harrison,2011-12-14 14:40:00,2202," No way, no how. Scam written all over it."
648293,lew,2011-12-14 14:41:00,12766, My feelings exactly Phil
