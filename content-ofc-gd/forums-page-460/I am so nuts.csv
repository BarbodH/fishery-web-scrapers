648557,lew,2011-12-15 08:18:00,12766, Nice one Roger and it's certainly bigger than any fish I caught yesterday from my couch
648558,misfish,2011-12-15 09:53:00,29133,Back ground shots   Nice fish Roger.  Now put the boat away so we can ice fish.
648564,Skipper D,2011-12-15 10:45:00,1970,A fishing HERO who is not nuts at all . Thank you .
648584,Rizzo,2011-12-15 12:45:00,4754," that was deliberate Brian...we were truly in no man's land when we caught that one. 30 feet of water, no structure there, no structure nearby no nothing. If somebody wants to try and fish that spot again they can have it. We'll call that fish roaming the main lake basin."
648588,scugpg,2011-12-15 12:53:00,1373,Nice job Rizzo!
648624,fishindevil,2011-12-15 14:43:00,6254,"congrats on such a late season ski !!! not many years you can unwinterize your boat,this late in the year...cheers"
648656,fishnsled,2011-12-15 16:38:00,3520,A very nice late season bonus. Worth your efforts I'd say.
648130,Rizzo,2011-12-14 00:22:00,4754,"Thanks to all the tips I got here the boat was nicely winterized and in position for its first winter outdoors, even pulled one of the wheels off...until I got a call requesting one more musky attempt. How do you turn that down? Pulling it out of retirement for one last shot at it tomorrow."
648132,EC1,2011-12-14 00:27:00,930,"Good Luck! Just know that people that don't fish will think you're crazy! Last night, I was pulled over by a cop while driving (Because I u-turned when I saw him - I wasn't running, but turning around because of the frozen over lakes I saw) and he saw the canoe on my car and thought I was a little nuts too!"
648133,Skipper D,2011-12-14 00:30:00,1970,"iF GUYS ARE GOING TO TAKE THIER BOATS BACK OUT , THEN I AM GONA TOO !"
648164,kickingfrog,2011-12-14 01:21:00,8333,Today would have been a great day on Simcoe.
648165,mercman,2011-12-14 01:22:00,7054,"Plus 8 on thursday. I""d take mine out too if only i wasnt so dang lazy"
648170,Fish Farmer,2011-12-14 01:36:00,2234,"Go for it Rizzo,   Only takes a couple hours to put her back to sleep."
648172,ccmtcanada,2011-12-14 01:38:00,7971,"I'm seriously thinking of going out Saturday in my boat!!, lol"
648173,ketchenany,2011-12-14 01:40:00,3229, They probably meant BOOTS!
648174,Skipper D,2011-12-14 01:41:00,1970,"  Is it tomorrow thats going to 51.F , its going to be awful tempting if it dose ."
648177,Skipper D,2011-12-14 01:44:00,1970,  Boots Ahoy! ..... it don't matter ........
648181,Rizzo,2011-12-14 01:59:00,4754,"Batteries are charging, tarps are off, all the rods/lures/trolling motor are out of the attic, email sent to the boss...its a go! I recommend anyone else thinking of it to go for it! Thursday looks warmer but really rainy so we opted for tomorrow. Put the wheel back on in the am, batteries in the boat, drag it out of the yard and away we go."
648184,mercman,2011-12-14 02:07:00,7054,  We want to see what you get  Think of all us landlocked sailors when yer out there on the water
648186,fishdawg,2011-12-14 02:11:00,912,"i like your style Roger,  go get'em bud"
648196,RickOnt,2011-12-14 03:03:00,669,Hey Rizzo  Hope you get the 'Big' Guy!!  Rick
648219,spinnerbaitking,2011-12-14 04:20:00,1622,Hospital tomorrow & hopefully boat out Thursday or Friday SBK
648222,Sinker,2011-12-14 04:45:00,8692,"My boat is also hooked up and ready to go for the morning. A different kind of hunting though, no fish involved  Good luck on a December musky!   S."
648248,bubbles,2011-12-14 12:24:00,591,I saw 4 boats launching in Lake St. Clair yesterday.  I imagine there were quite a few more at the more popular launches....... I was leaving for work and quite jealous.
648407,Rizzo,2011-12-14 21:37:00,4754,"...it was worth it. Ice at the launch was an inch and a quarter thick, broke a light on the trailer, took half an hour of smashing ice with an anchor on a rope to get to open water but it was still worth it...photo to come later, have to get ready for company Christmas party"
648408,Skipper D,2011-12-14 21:50:00,1970,"Way ta go Rizzo , awsome , we'll be back for the pic show ."
648409,lew,2011-12-14 21:52:00,12766,"Atta boy Roger, hope you beat the biggun from your last trip."
648410,misfish,2011-12-14 21:58:00,29133,  That made me lmao Rog.   Look forward to the pics.
648411,mercman,2011-12-14 21:59:00,7054,Oh No !!! Not another tail light  I still have that set for ya if you want.   
648517,Rizzo,2011-12-15 03:10:00,4754,"I wish I had beat the last one Lew but it was not to be. We caught this one and lost another. Not the biggest fish out there but to be catching any musky on December 14 is good in my books. Now to ""re-winterize"" the boat before someone calls me about fishing tomorrow!  "
648519,Rizzo,2011-12-15 03:14:00,4754," ...trust me, I thought of you right away! Because my buddy convinced me to get the boat out, and then convinced me to break the ice by backing in, he has graciously offered to purchase a new set and install them for me Saturday when I put the boat back to bed! Thank you again for the offer though. If he doesn't come through for me Saturday I'll be in touch"
648523,mercman,2011-12-15 03:25:00,7054,   Anytime Bud!! Important thing is ya got ta fish till the end of December
