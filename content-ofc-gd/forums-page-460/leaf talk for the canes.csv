648108,bigugli,2011-12-13 23:13:00,6138," I got to see 2 of the playoff games in 67. Stepfather had to share them out with other sibs and family members  . Sitting at centre ice, top row greys. We had clear view of Foster from our seats. Didn't have to move our heads to see the game."
648255,Jer,2011-12-14 13:04:00,1426,   I hope you didn't play that combo on your ProLine ticket.
648320,jimmer,2011-12-14 16:09:00,2730,Well they kept pace! Go Leafs Go!
648334,tb4me,2011-12-14 17:15:00,3295,It was a great game. Leafs looked fast on the feet. Kessel had a quick game too.. Tissue Tim nets 2 goals. What suprised me the most was we out shot them by as much as double..Good work boys!
648337,DRIFTER_016,2011-12-14 17:35:00,10439,I hate the fact that the sportsnet games other than the West ones are always blacked out for me. Tried to find a stream of last nights game to keep up on the score with no luck. The Jets/Wild game was a good one though. As was the Sharks/Av's game.
648339,Rod Caster,2011-12-14 17:37:00,5784,  Jets/Wild was a great game indeed! Things are looking better in the 'Peg
648341,manitoubass2,2011-12-14 17:46:00,11391,"Carolina was held in the game with some great goaltending. It was a very good game, although I was nervous when the leafs took that late penalty, lol. Reimer looked very solid.  Almost everygame I'm shocked by the leafs speed. Man they are fast!  and woot woot Winnipeg! Great win for them, and they've been playing really well as of late"
648495,d_paluch,2011-12-15 02:28:00,343,"I was at that game. Great game!!! Gotta love seeing the game live, gives you more respect for just how talented the players really are.   Couldn't have seen a better game live. A few more goals would have been nice, but at least they were competitive. One of the few games this season that they played a full 60+mins. Cam Ward was standing on his head."
648538,johnl,2011-12-15 04:29:00,197,ya ward was really on his game
648664,jedimaster,2011-12-15 17:02:00,3472,"OK so I am a little late to follow up, but they did play a good solid game. not as many goals as one woul dlike against such a poorly playing team but Ward stood on his head. As for general hockey talk did anyone catch the Kane shootout goal from last night? HOLY CRAP!!!! Here it is incase you haven't seen it...  "
648669,manitoubass2,2011-12-15 17:11:00,11391,"Yeah Jedi, that was a rediculous display of puck handling. Personally I loved it, my kids loved it as well. Then I heard from a few buds and they hated it, lol. To each their own I suppose"
648673,Headhunter,2011-12-15 17:18:00,5703,"Great goal! Heck, he looked like Kadri out there!!!! HH"
648674,DRIFTER_016,2011-12-15 17:19:00,10439,Yeah I saw it and was surprised that Backstrom was still fully clothed after being so badly undressed!!!
648678,kickingfrog,2011-12-15 17:31:00,8333,Poke check.
648679,manitoubass2,2011-12-15 17:32:00,11391, lol  I think the announcer was left just as naked...   
648718,tb4me,2011-12-15 20:05:00,3295,"Ya that was a neat goal....But come on, how is a Pro goalie now a spectator? That was silly, a simple poke check and Kane is finished there..I bet he doesnt get away with that again...The Gig is up. I liked what Kipper had to say, ""Pfft,he would be on his butt if it were any other goalie"" lol.. As annoying as Kipper is he is right this time..."
648720,DRIFTER_016,2011-12-15 20:10:00,10439, You are getting very sleepy!!!! LOL 
648754,uglyfish,2011-12-15 22:26:00,981,"It was a nice goal, but nuthin spectacular really. Like mentioned, a poke check ends that. And backstrom backed up to far, to fast."
648023,jedimaster,2011-12-13 18:13:00,3472,So what happens if the leafs bomb this one and reimer gets shelled? Is it panic time? I am really hoping the leafs win convincingly.
648025,tb4me,2011-12-13 18:17:00,3295,Im with you on this one..I will say if Reims does loose tonight and start a free fall Willy may not be coaching the leafs very long..The Monster is whining up a storm. He wants to play BAD. This could get interesting..  On another side note Claude Giroux (the new NHL scoring leader) is out with a concussion.. When is this going to end....
648027,jimmer,2011-12-13 18:17:00,2730,"They should have no problem with the last place team. If they lose, then start to show concern. Skinner is hurt, which can't hurt the leaf's chances of winning."
648031,manitoubass2,2011-12-13 18:31:00,11391,"I think Reimer just needs a win for his confidence. If he can do that tonight, I think he'll be fine. The talent is there for sure, just gotta believe your going to win.  Monster has done a great job filling in. For some reason though, at least for me, he just doesn't ""seem"" like a starting goalie in the NHL. He always has me on edge, lol.  As for the concussions, it won't stop until they downscale the equipment. And with Sid sitting out once again, maybe this will happen sooner, rather then later?  As for the game tonight, I'm stoked. It was a long weekend for us Leafs fans"
648033,dobee,2011-12-13 18:44:00,301,"maybe they should have stayed and rode the wave with gustaffson?? the dude starts to get HOT and you let your ailing starter come back in??  i have always said the monster NEVER gets a chance to play his best.. sure it may take him a game or two to get back into the swing of things, but for f' sakes when he gets hot and gets you wins ride that wave.. hes a good goaltender when he has confidence!  he finally got his shot this year and you panic and bring up scrivens???? give your head a shake burke!"
648035,Jds63,2011-12-13 18:50:00,1365,Leafs will win tonight
648037,tb4me,2011-12-13 18:59:00,3295,"This is actually Wilsons call , not Burkes. This is also what I was referring to with the loosing skid under Reimer..Wilsons call may cost him his job if the leafs continue the slide backwards..Lets hope not..One thing I have noticed with Reimer is, he usually almost all of the time lets 2 soft goals go by before he can play his A game. However with the horrible PK and lack of scoring lately 2 goals against is almost a death sentence for that game.. Lets hope for the best.  On a lighter note Lombardi was at practice today and shooting the puck for the first time since his shoulder injury! Go Leafs Go."
648038,jedimaster,2011-12-13 19:02:00,3472,"Yah, I was a big gustoff fan when he came here, but I don't think he got a fair shake. He came in with allot of weight on him and the team in front sucked pretty hard. Now that he does seem to be playing well enough to win, Reimer is back in the net. Lets see how long this goes for Reimer. He has to win soon or he will be watching from the bench. I think Wilson is well aware he is on the ropes. What a long weekend with no hockey. Thank god I was out at the hunt camp shooting deer with the front stuffer."
648039,capt bruce,2011-12-13 19:05:00,820,"I really thought with monster getting some wins I would have brought Riem to the marlies and let him play his way into game shape with a few weeks of playing and than brought him back . Maybe they were afraid for his  Confidence , but playing when he sat for all that time , what has loseing done for his Confidence , week or two down on the marlies would have let him shake off the cobwebs and get his legs back .. just mho , wilson cant coach , how long can you stay with A guy without a system , leafs win when they play lessor teams and just go and out skate them , well coached teams beat them time and time again . At least I am one who can say I have seen the leafs win 3 cups .. not many here now that can say that and the years pass by ...lol"
648040,tb4me,2011-12-13 19:09:00,3295,"Lol Bruce...I wouldnt be bragging about that to loud...  Reims doesnt have a 2 way contract anymore, so the marlies is out for sure."
648044,kickingfrog,2011-12-13 19:22:00,8333,"Two way contract or not reimer could have been sent down for conditioning, but it's too late now."
648051,jedimaster,2011-12-13 20:03:00,3472,I think he would need to pass waivers to get sent down wouldn't he?
648055,capt bruce,2011-12-13 20:18:00,820,"Waiver Exemptions  There are four ways in which a player can be exempt from waivers; they have been recently exposed to waivers, they are on emergency recall, they are on a conditioning assignment, or they have not met the experience requirement.  And tb4 now im really bragging it WAS 4 not 3 forgot 1962 .. I was at games to see 4 cups lol ..."
648061,Jds63,2011-12-13 20:49:00,1365,  I think I saw them on TV in 67 ... i know my Dad watched them .. I was probably in bed
648063,anders,2011-12-13 21:04:00,1168,"If Buff, Montreal, Jersey and the Caps win tonight, with a leafs loss, they are on the outside looking in  jus saying"
648064,muskymatt,2011-12-13 21:15:00,2608," I assume the ""haters need not reply"" refers to me    But, I can't help myself!!  What do you mean ""IF"" the laffs lose tonight????  :w00t:  You guys are so used to losing you can't help but think about losing, even when you're winning.....priceless!!!  :rofl2:  Seriously though, did you really think Reimer was going to be the end all of the leafs problems? The Leafs are 2 injuries away from being in the basement, I'm not hoping that anyone gets hurt but if you take away Kessels and Lupols goals/points, you do not have much."
648065,Brettiop,2011-12-13 21:19:00,279,Thats quite the IF...  I predict a 5-1 leafs win!
648066,jedimaster,2011-12-13 21:19:00,3472,If you take away the top 2 scorers on ANY team you don't have much...Silly Sens fans.
648068,uglyfish,2011-12-13 21:22:00,981,"Reimer didn't play bad in his losses, nor did he lose the games for his team. It was the lack of scoring and defense in front of him that cost the games. He's ur number one, u go with him. Gustavsson is the backup, he's lucky he even got that job this year. He's not a number 1 NHL goalie, yet. He needs to work on his positioning and rebound control. And stop ""losing"" the net when he plays."
648069,muskymatt,2011-12-13 21:25:00,2608," What do I have to cheer about?  Jason ""turnover"" Spezza !!!!!  The guys a joke, Sens were up 3-0 and Spezza gave it away for 2 SHORTHANDED goals....  And you're statement is incorrect, Pens were without Crosby and Malkin and they were still tops in the league."
648073,Brettiop,2011-12-13 21:30:00,279,
648079,capt bruce,2011-12-13 21:46:00,820," Dude didnt hear anyone saying Pens are not deep , but 97% of the nhl ARE NOT . Leafs with a good coach are one of the better up and comeing teams in the nhl, sorry but its TRUE , best team we have put onto the ice in many years , You talk of pens , WELL coached teams with a little depth will allways be hard to play against , pens ARE WELL coached , they can over come injurys with playing TO A PLAN not just going out there and trying to just out skate the oponents (with crosby and malkin they can ,without they need to stick to the plan, and they do), better to out think them ... We have a team we have a chance BUT WE NEED A COACH ... wheres PUNCH when you need him .."
648083,kickingfrog,2011-12-13 21:51:00,8333,It only takes a speck of chicken poop to ruin a hole bowl of chicken salad.
648086,Rod Caster,2011-12-13 21:57:00,5784," Haha. That guy makes me laugh every game.  To Leafs fans: don't worry, Bell and Rogers will save you."
