150920,bassboy,2008-01-15 01:07:00,161,Nice ride Memart!  Looks sweet!!
150926,addict,2008-01-15 01:22:00,475,"sweet rig, damn i cant wait till spring just built a huge casting deck in mine cant wait to slap a foot control trolling motor and fish till my arms fall off maybe ill see ya on the water."
150935,mikeh,2008-01-15 02:00:00,824,"have to agree with misfish on maxing out on the horsepower. Did you price out a 75 opti or 4 stroke? I read an article the other day gas will be $1.50 ltr by 2012 ,assuming you plan on keeping it that long.  Nice size boat."
150937,moosehead,2008-01-15 02:08:00,90,"You are going to like that boat, I have the 1660 classic and love it. Mine performs well with a 60hp 4 stroke."
150939,Joey,2008-01-15 02:13:00,9122,"Congrats Bud, that's a sweet looking boat.  Joey"
150962,mistyriver1,2008-01-15 03:19:00,600,"Congrats Rob, nice looking boat.  Good luck with it."
150975,medmart,2008-01-15 04:12:00,587, I asked about upgraden the motor but two things stoped me the wife and more $$$$$$$$$ LOL
150978,icefisherman,2008-01-15 04:21:00,952,"Welcome to the Lund exclusive private club Wayne should be giving you one of those Lund hats any time now  Cheers, Ice Fisherman"
150983,Minnow,2008-01-15 05:28:00,177,Nice boat and congratulations! Lund Aluminum boats are the best aluminum boats on the market in my opinion
150985,kennyman,2008-01-15 05:57:00,737,Very nice. You're making me very jealous. Someday ........ someday. Have fun and catch a ton of fish. Nice colour scheme too.
150997,mart,2008-01-15 11:27:00,93,Congrats on the new boat!!! Enjoy it.
150999,SlowPoke,2008-01-15 11:36:00,2984,Congrats on the new ride but please don't become one of those insufferable Lund owners... even sail boat owners think they are snobs! -Brian
151012,b2kptbo,2008-01-15 12:47:00,1505,"Good one, nice..."
151016,ccmtcanada,2008-01-15 13:11:00,7971,SWEET RIDE!!! Congrats!
151020,Beans,2008-01-15 13:25:00,3339,Dat's some nice boat you gots dere boy...Congrats  Before launching her make sure the plug is in place and also make sure the dealer put the cotter pin in place for the prop...  As soon as my bro-in-law put his new boat in reverse the prop fell off and we had to use the trolling motor to get back home...
151021,Greencoachdog,2008-01-15 13:30:00,8163," Don't worry about the horsepower, it's not that big of a deal! My 17' Tracker is rated for a 90 hp, and I only have a 50 4 stk. on it. It gets me where I want to go at 33 mph and for a lot less fuel than other boats.  You'll realize 3 substantial savings. 1. The overall cost of the boat 2. Your insurance will be a lot cheaper 3. Your fuel bill will be a fraction of what others pay with larger motors."
151039,tonyb,2008-01-15 15:07:00,1637,Very nice...did you get it at the Boat Show?
151120,JFR,2008-01-15 20:15:00,498,"Congrats, sweet ride"
151653,tinbanger,2008-01-17 13:42:00,1028,NICE !  We 've had our 1775 SS Classic ( 90HP) for two years now and love it . Only issue was stiching on driver seat ripping ( replaced under warranty) and the trim switches.First year on the throttle ( again warranty) and last year the one on the motor started acting up.  We have 100's of hours on her already plus a few dents and scratchEs ( first one one is the worse  )  Very happy with the package overall and DT has been excellent to deal with.  This will be your longest winter you can remenmber !   TB
