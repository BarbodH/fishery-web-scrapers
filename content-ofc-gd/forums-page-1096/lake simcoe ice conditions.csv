151119,irishfield,2008-01-15 20:07:00,26272,I know some lads that fished it Saturday and Sunday...they had to pull their stuff with ropes...across open water to get from shore to the ice.
151122,ranger520vx,2008-01-15 20:23:00,164,Have some patience and MAYBE this weekend. It is starting to firm up again. All operators have pulled off and are off as of today.
151146,Beans,2008-01-15 22:25:00,3339,Another week and a half should see good ice again on Cook's Bay and along the south shore...check first.  Lets hope some damn fools don't get too itchy and mess up the ice at the shorelines or nobody will be able to drive out this season...
151233,lovetofish,2008-01-16 02:44:00,500,"Thats kind of what i suspected.  Very good point beans, never thought of that.   Just checked the weather for Barrie and its suppose to get pretty cold up there this weekend, especially at night.  Hopefully everything will go well and we can get back out there without having to worry about the ice.  Thanks for your help guys.  lovetofish"
