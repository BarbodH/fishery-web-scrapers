151014,Vanselena,2008-01-15 12:59:00,269,"I am not as old as you guys but I remember collecting pop bottles for $.02 a piece.  Hopping fences, going down to the creek to catch frogs or tadpoles, even bring home field mice and snakes and watching the snakes eat the mice... mom loved that one...lol.  Steeles avenue was the end of the world and driving up to Preston Lake to go to the beach.  Building snow forts and having snowball fights at school.  Bumper Hitching  Egging cars  Street hockey when every house had kids.  Getting the strap until it hurt to sit down.  The kids were the dishwasher."
151022,Squid,2008-01-15 13:32:00,1656,"As a matter of fact, we still have a  guy going around our area ringing his bell looking for something to sharpen. I used to take my cart down to the grocery store and buy my dad a pack of craven A's and a 12 pack of Dow beer. I was 10 at the time. Try that today."

Despite all the new cartoons on now, my kids like Bugs the best !!  It's part of out bedtime routine for my younger son.  Squid, we still have a guy that comes around our area as well and sharpens knives scissors etc.. with that distinctive bell."

150881,vance,2008-01-14 23:44:00,719,How about the daily dose of COD LIVER OIL I still get nightmares over that stuff.   vance

150885,camillj,2008-01-14 23:50:00,1988, hmmm .. was that 743331 ?   Im a wee bit younger ... but I think Brampton still had a 416 'area-code' ... actually I think you had to call the operator for long distance to 'book' your call ... especially if it was overseas ...  Keepsies and funzies  go-carts and bundle buggies were 'modern' things  everyone knew how to fly a kite
150892,Squid,2008-01-14 23:58:00,1656,"Burping up the cod liver at school, yech. Using a basebal bat to decide issues, with the fingers of your hand. Intermission at the movies."
150894,Squid,2008-01-14 23:59:00,1656,six channels on our TV.
150919,Bernie,2008-01-15 01:06:00,3190,"Up in my area back then I can remember (barely) having to crank the phone handle to get the operator and telling her the #. It was a two or three digit at the time.  We only had 3 channels on TV up here until 1980, four if you could speak French. Thats about when cable came to town."
150964,tjsa,2008-01-15 03:31:00,1578," We had two channels, CBC and OECA(Ontario Educational Communications Authority, now TVOntario), milk was delivered to our doorstep in a wire basket in glass bottles, and you could order your groceries over the phone and someone(almost always the store owner) would deliver it to you. I remember helping my mom mix margarine, you got the coloring in a separate packet, otherwise, margarine was white.  And, party lines for phones, someone else using it, you had to wait, or listen to them talk to their other party to find out when the line was free. Only a couple of years in my youth that happened, but I wasn't calling anybody then, my mom was trying to order groceries,  Thankfully, I never got subjected to Cod Liver Oil.  I am not quite 50+ yet, but I remember a lot of the stuff others have posted."

150979,Musky or Specks,2008-01-15 04:21:00,2710,How about living in a neighbourhood where there was enough kids to field two baseball teams for some pick up baseball? I too remember party lines and going to my grandmas and hand milking the cows and then carrying milk cans to the cooler and loading them on trucks in the morning.
