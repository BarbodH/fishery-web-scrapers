From what I've read seems they used to be two partners who split and started making their own product. Iâ€™ve read Controllking is more water proof of the two. Prices are about the same....Controlking is slightly cheaper but not by much.  I am just wandering if anyone who has used them can comment or compare them to each other, as I am about to order one of them for next trolling season.  P.S. If someone is interested in buying them I can let you in on very good deals on either of the two. Feel free to PM me.  Cheers, Ice Fisherman"

For those that don't know much about TrollMaster it is like cruise control for your kicker or smaller motor. Set the speed (RPM) and it stays, it also has momentary full throttle and an idle position. If you are trolling muskies at 5 mph and you get a fish on, hit the idle button and it will slow to an idle speed while you fight the fish, hit the idle button again and it will go back to the previous setting, can you say SWEET !!
