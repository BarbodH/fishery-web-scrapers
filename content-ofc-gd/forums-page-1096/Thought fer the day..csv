151551,Clampet,2008-01-17 01:30:00,1947,"A man and his dog were walking along a road. The man was enjoying the scenery,  when it suddenly occurred to him that he was dead.     He  remembered dying, and that the dog walking beside him had been dead for years.  He wondered where the road was leading them.      After  a while, they came to a high, white stone wall along one side of the road. It  looked like fine marble. At the top of a long hill, it was broken by a tall arch  that glowed in the sunlight.      When  he was standing before it he saw a magnificent gate in the arch that looked like  mother-of-pearl, and the street that led to the gate looked like pure gold. He  and the dog walked toward the gate, and as he got closer, he saw a man at a desk  to one side.       When  he was close enough, he called out, ""Excuse me, where are we?""       ""This  is Heaven, sir,"" the man answered.       ""Wow!  Would you happen to have some water?"" the man asked.        ""Of  course, sir. Come right in, and I'll have some ice water brought right up.""        The  man gestured, and the gate began to open.       ""Can  my friend,"" gesturing toward his dog, ""come in, too?"" the traveler asked.       ""I'm  sorry, sir, but we don't accept pets.""       The  man thought a moment and then turned back toward the road and continued the way  he had been going with his dog.       After  another long walk, and at the top of another long hill, he came to a dirt road  leading through a farm gate that looked as if it had never been closed. There  was no fence.       As  he approached the gate, he saw a man inside, leaning against a tree and reading  a book.       ""Excuse  me!"" he called to the man. ""Do you have any water?""       ""Yeah,  sure, there's a pump over there, come on in.""        ""How  about my friend here?"" the traveler gestured to the dog.       ""There  should be a bowl by the pump.""        They  went through the gate, and sure enough, there was an old-fashioned hand pump  with a bowl beside it.        The  traveler filled the water bowl and took a long drink himself, then he gave some  to the dog.       When  they were full, he and the dog walked back toward the man who was standing by  the tree.      ""What  do you call this place?"" the traveler asked.       ""This  is Heaven,"" he answered.        ""Well,  that's confusing,"" the traveler said. ""The man down the road said that was  Heaven, too.""        ""Oh,  you mean the place with the gold street and pearly gates? Nope. That's hell.""        ""Doesn't  it make you mad for them to use your name like that?""      ""No,  we're just happy that they screen out the folks who would leave their best  friends behind.""  "

151636,pikehunter,2008-01-17 12:45:00,1659,That is a good one. Still trying to figure out if it was funny or a lesson to be learned? Going to make me think twice if if I see there is a set of pearly gates at the end of my road.
