I fished Boshkung on January 5th and there was approx 6 inches of ice-2 inches of white on top of four of good ice, but that was before the big thaw and high winds.  Anyone been up there in the last week or fished last weekend?  Any ice condition reports? Thanks."

Rest of the weekend was spent on kash. the shorelines are fresh ice as the lake went up by 2' with the rain and meltwater. Once out there we found 9"" of mostly black ice [cleats would have been a good idea]. 8 pick's over the weekend between 2 guys, best being 2 1/2 lb. All other big lakes we looked at were in bad shape, some huts through, large open areas at inflows. This week of colder weather will make a big difference. It should make everything safe except for the main bodies of the big lakes. Cheers squiggs"
