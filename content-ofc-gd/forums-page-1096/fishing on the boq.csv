151191,steelhedrmatt,2008-01-16 01:12:00,278,I met Hawg Hunter and the boys @ Carra's on Christmas eve. Good bunch of guys. lotsa info. Even said he would find a way to get my crippled brother out. ( broken leg just before christmas screwed his ice season) I would reccomend him although I've not been out with him. You can't beat the experience of a local guide to put you on the fish.
