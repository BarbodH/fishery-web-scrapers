I already have a 332C, but I think this would be great because it can be used in the car and also can easily be taken with me when in someone elses boat or a rental or canoe etc.  Any thoughts or opinions about this unit?  http://www.lowrance.com/Products/Automotive/XOG/  It's about $249 CDN"

The Zog does so much more than the older model. I was catually thinking of selling mine and upgrading. If you can find it for that price your in good shape, usually around $300 cdn."
150671,Metisfisherman,2008-01-14 13:21:00,11,"I purchased the XOG just before Christmas, It's a nice unit, but has a few faults. Great for ice fishing, when using the Navionics Gold card. The faults with this unit are: alot of the roads when used in the automoblie, look like they are going into the water.(lots of the roads around Lake Ontario look like they are in the water). The second problem is they are difficult to see in the bright sun.( needs a visor around them). Battery life of this rechargable unit is not the best.(lighter socket around, then your ok). Lowrance has updated the firmware twice since my purchase.  Even with these faults, I find the unit worth purchasing for it's versatility and price.(boat, car and on foot)  just my thoughts"
