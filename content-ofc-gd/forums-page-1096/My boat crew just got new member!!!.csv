151389,icefisherman,2008-01-16 19:45:00,952,"Well,  As many of you know we were expecting our second child and this morning (January 16) at exactly 6:16am we became happy parents of our second child....Too tired after not having a minute sleep over the past two days but mother and baby are doing fine. It was not an easy delivery, but they are both fine now. And Santa (who has been so good with me lately) delivering my new Lund a bit early, just delivered again...this time even better present. With new boat...great wife and two sons...How can anyone not be extremely happy with such boat/fishing crew?!!?  Here is the star of the night in his full glory:    Time to get some sleep. Cheers to all and look out for us in the new season and many more to come....   Ice Fisherman"
