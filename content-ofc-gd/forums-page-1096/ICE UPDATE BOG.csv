151347,addict,2008-01-16 16:00:00,475,decided to try scumbog this morn.goreski area most areas had about 8-9 inches of ice but some serious soft spot glad there wasnt to much snow u could clearly see them as it got brighter large dark patches accidently crossed the edge of one it felt soft  used my scoop to pick at it broke through like nothing if i wasnt a light guy i would have been swimmin for sure it was an area of about 10 square feet.as it got brighter u could see quitea few of these spots use caution or give it a few more days.fished for about and hr then wham fish on the way it hit and how strong it was i knew it was a lunge after a short battle i got a look about 32inch got his head in the hole twice before i broke off.fished for another hour and nothing making a pit stop for lunch then gonna try for steel this afternoon.be safe and good luck.
