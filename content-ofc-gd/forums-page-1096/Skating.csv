150654,lew,2008-01-14 12:10:00,12767," Marc, a bunch of the Fire Dept's here in Ontario got together 20 - 25  years ago and formed a league that started out fairly small but really caught on and expanded to become so big it was eventually split into about 4 divisons.  It was extremely popular and alot of fun  and the teams would travel all over Southern Ontario to play and the fans would also travel to the various games to support them.  After a few years we went international for tourneys and they'd be held in a different city each year and included American teams from the Fire Dept's of New York City, Boston, Detroit, Buffalo, and I think Chicago if I remember correctly.  I haven't watched the NHL in decades but these games were far superior in my opinion. I wasn't good enough to play in that caliber but I travelled around and watched alot of the games and some of those guys were unbelievably talented.  I don't know the actual reason but the league was unfortunately disbanded eventually, but for quite a few years it provided alot of excellent hockey players the opportunity to meet and play against many teams from both sides of the border.  It was really good stuff while it lasted !!"
150656,steve_paul,2008-01-14 12:30:00,658,"  Shooter, same tournament.  How did you make out?  And the body does feel like it was ridden hard and put away wet this morning as well"
150657,jediangler,2008-01-14 12:40:00,1923,"When I played in a league in St.Clements there was a firefighters team. We let them have an unlimited roster because of their shifts. You could play the same team two weeks in a row and every player was different. We used to joke about starting a fire somewhere before the game so they would be short of players. They always kicked our keisters. In the ""A"" division of the KW shop league there was an all police team. They were the dirtiest team in the league. But where else can you assault an officer with a weapon and only get 2 minutes in the box I'd be in for a ""GTG on ice"" if it was close enough to home."

150663,Roy,2008-01-14 13:01:00,13728,"Great story, Jedi! hahahaha"
151271,shooter,2008-01-16 05:40:00,19,hey steve paul:  how did you do?... we were in the over 50 division..lost to windsor..beat port stanley then lost to st thomas....nice facility you have there....maybe hook up next year..this was our third trip there for this tourney..
151337,irishfield,2008-01-16 14:37:00,26272,Wife goes skating for an agressive 2.5 hrs every Monday and Thursday afternoon. I'd better start going with her as she's getting into such great shape she's gonna trade plump old me in for some lean young stud! LOL
151367,steve_paul,2008-01-16 18:01:00,658," It is a good tournament.  We won our division and ended up with a nice jacket out of it to go with the sore back and legs.  Port beat St. Thomas in your division finals (they played right before our final on the Sunday)  If you are coming down next year, let me know and we'll have a pop or 2 between games."
151371,lovetofish,2008-01-16 18:37:00,500,"I played hockey for 13 years.  I have only been on skates once in the past seven years, but just pieced together enough equipment to go play.  Some of the younger guys from my work play shinny...  guess we will see how out of shape i really am... lol.... this is going to hurt, but i love the game and can't wait.  lovetofish"
151652,Marc Thorpe,2008-01-17 13:42:00,621," Ya Wayne, should trade them blades that glide in air for blades that glide on ice Who knows, you might be sporting Swarthy,carved and chiseled features by the spring  Paul nice to see you involved and playing at this level  Jedi,good laugh"
150646,Marc Thorpe,2008-01-14 10:31:00,621,"Cool,seems few folks skate.Skated and played hockey till my 20's Got back into it this year but did skate some 5 years ago,feels real good  Lew,speaking with my cousin over the holidays who is a fire fighter like his Dad here in MTL plays every week in a get together leaugue somewhat like you mentioned,was thinking maybe by end of season I will loosened up and back into it to play by next fall  ccmt, cool pic,ya kids get us into things.The pond pics are a thing of beauty.Nothing like skating outside on a home made rink.Remember skating myself on the st lawrence river with my dad and Ice Boating when I was kid  Roy,ya Emerald shiner in the Top Corner 2 Minutes for Hooking !  Misfish you played some serious hockey too,I played very competitive when I was younger also but its funny how some wiggles show up after years  but they soon go away after a few times Ya get that feeling in your legs again  I thought of bringning it up,winter is kinna boring (because I do office work at this time of the year) and hibernating like Yogi stiffens things up Ice fishing is ok but not its not like fishing during the summer season. I see some sled,quad but many other things to do,skating was thing I enjoyed Lots of outside rinks here but we need some cold to get em in use again,so inside delas are the thing next few weeks  Joe,roller blade hockey looks fun.I suspect the glide is not the same.Actually there was, not sure if there is a proffessional league of roller blade hockey stil around.The past owner of the Mtl Road Runners speaks of his moments about it while fishing with me.Always intruiged by it but wheels on my shoes scare me,but then again like GCD says,""filet Knives under Boots """
150647,Marc Thorpe,2008-01-14 10:32:00,621,"  Keep that thought,OFC skate a thon Renting ice is not all that expensive"
