A man owned a small farm in Missouri  The Missouri State Wage & Hour Department claimed he was not paying proper wages to his help and sent an agent out to interview him.  ""I need a list of your employees and how much you pay them,"" demanded the agent.  "" Well,"" replied the farmer, ""there's my farm hand who 's been with me for 3 years. I pay him $200 a week plus free room and board.""  ""The cook has been here for 18 months, and I pay her $150 per week plus free room and board.""  ""Then there's the half-wit who works about 18 hours every day and does about 90% of all the work around here. He makes about $10 per week, pays his own room and board, and I buy him a bottle of bourbon every Saturday night. He also sleeps with my wife occasionally."" ""That's the guy I want to talk to --- the half-wit,"" says the agent.   ""That would be me,"" replied the farmer."
