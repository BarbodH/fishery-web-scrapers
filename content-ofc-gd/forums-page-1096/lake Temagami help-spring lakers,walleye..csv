I know it's a big intimidating lake, so I need as much advice as I can get from all you Lake Temagami experts. We will be staying in the hub. I've researched a few spots. Rabbitnose island, high rock island. What about Ferguson bay ? It's a long way on the map, is it worth our time ? Any other advice would be appreciated.  4.5 months and counting can't wait.  thanks."

151366,Riparian,2008-01-16 17:46:00,269,A portable sonar unit would be a great help in locating underwater structure and depth. This will help you locate the fish.  Sorry I have minimal experience in this area but thats the best advice I can give you.
