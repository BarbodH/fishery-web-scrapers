150737,ranger520vx,2008-01-14 17:32:00,164,Anglers Atlas   Some of the old MNR hydrographic charts have been liscensed to this site.  A great deal of smaller lakes are available for FREE!!
150742,wuchikubo,2008-01-14 18:17:00,1114,"A good reminder, Mark. It was posted some time ago but many may not know about it. It has some lakes but definitely not all."
150799,cranks bait,2008-01-14 21:21:00,721,"Thanks for this link.  It may not have all the lakes, but it does have our cottage lake.  I just wish it would let me log in"
150822,mistaredone,2008-01-14 22:06:00,913,The site was just updated.  If you have used this site before its worth checking out again.
150827,Gerritt,2008-01-14 22:19:00,6129,I cant log on either and never received their email to activate my account....
150904,mcallister.grant,2008-01-15 00:14:00,327,"I signed up with them a couple of weeks ago and I think they are pretty cool.  However, they need to add a few more lakes. A cool little site nonetheless!"
150959,tjsa,2008-01-15 03:15:00,1578,":lol:  be careful of where those balloons are indicating lakes. I looked up my area in Thunder Bay, and only one lake was indicated, Perch Lake. I already have the hydrographic map for it btw.  It shows on the site it is on the mainland between a big lake, Loch Lomond, and the Lake Superior shoreline, BUT, in actual fact, it is on Pie Island...........................11 kms to the east, surrounded by Lake Superior!!!!!!!!!!  And those maps are not charts, they are maps that the MNR techs made quickly, they are not for navigational purposes. TRUST ME! I have discovered a few shoals and rock outcrops on some of them not on those maps on a few different lakes up this way. My skeg has the blunt force trauma to prove it."
150961,fishing,2008-01-15 03:18:00,167,Good site. It has a map I am interested in. Thanks.
151018,ccmtcanada,2008-01-15 13:16:00,7971, I didn't receive my email to activate either.
151097,fishing,2008-01-15 19:07:00,167,I received my email to activate it in about 3 or 4 hours. It works fine.
151162,Gerritt,2008-01-15 23:52:00,6129,  I still have not received mine... mind sending me the map for Ivanhoe Lake?? desoua at hotmail.com  Thanks!  G
151166,ranger520vx,2008-01-16 00:05:00,164,Sent to your email. Im writing the site mentioning recent registration problems.
151178,Gerritt,2008-01-16 00:37:00,6129,  I got it! thanks! I am heading there in July!  Thanks again very much appreciated!  G
151180,Beats,2008-01-16 00:42:00,543,"  Same here.  Even checked my ""junk"" email folder and nothing there."
151252,Joey,2008-01-16 04:08:00,9122,"I had no problems.  Got my activation email in about 2 seconds.  It did go to my junkmail tho.  Cool site.  It has the map of the lake I needed last year  Some are very detailed I noticed, while others are not  I think it will be somewhat helpful for new lakes to try.  Thanks for the link.  Joey"
151276,Woodsman,2008-01-16 10:22:00,1286,"Thanks for the tip. My activation ""e"" mail came fine.  Best Wishes: Rick"
151300,cranks bait,2008-01-16 12:56:00,721,Two days and I still cannot get in.  It says my account is inactive and cannot do anything.
151385,ranger520vx,2008-01-16 19:16:00,164,I received an update that they corrected a problem on their mail server. Those that registered should receive confirmations.  Write them if you experience issues.
151415,drwxr,2008-01-16 20:57:00,453,would be nice if they added small notes stating which lakes have shore access for fishing. or launch a canoe or kayak.
151428,bbog,2008-01-16 21:20:00,665,I got my account information seconds after registering. Did a quick look around and found one lake about 75 miles West of where it really is    All in all looks to be a pretty good source of information.
