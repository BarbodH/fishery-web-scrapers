150404,goober,2008-01-13 18:35:00,14,Does anyone know of good affordable fish finders for ice fishing which can then be used in the summer on a canoe? I wouldn't want to spend more than $450.00   thanks
150407,Terry,2008-01-13 18:45:00,14456,"I am very happy with my X67c ice machine and I use it i n the summer on my folding boat for back lakes, I had to buy a second transducer with a suction cup you can use it had a regular fishfinder graph or as a color flasher   X67C IceMachine click here"
150408,jhm,2008-01-13 19:13:00,15,"Hey Goober..........I would recommend buying a Vex. or Marcum there's all kinds of used Vex's right now on the different message boards at really good prices.........$200 you could find a good Vex.......You can always find a used portable finder cheap........You'd be way under $450........Nothing against the IceMachine I've seen them they look great but a Vex will last for ever I don't know how many year's those LCD""s would hold up under the tough ice fishing conditions...........Just my 2 cents ..........JHM"
150411,mcallister.grant,2008-01-13 19:26:00,327,Get a used Vex. Or you can get a brand new one on line for less than $450....
150416,buckster,2008-01-13 19:39:00,530,Vex all the way... although that X67icemachine is a good multi purpose unit and could get one for $400 right off the shelf.
150422,Mike the Pike,2008-01-13 20:05:00,3421,I saw a Cuda 128 by Eagle (Portable Unit)at Walmart this week for $60.00 regular price is $144.00.Would be perfect for a canoe .you may have to go to a few walmarts before you find one.Good luck with your purchase.
150444,Sinker,2008-01-13 21:50:00,8692,"If your planning on using it in a boat, I'd stick with a graph and not a flasher.  The flasher is great for icefishing, because it is in real time, but I wouldn't want one for openwater fishing from a boat.  The X67 will work well for both.  Sinker"

150469,goober,2008-01-13 22:51:00,14,"how's the lowrance quality, warranty and service...is it a good company? Also, where are these built, because I am trying to stay away from anything that might be made overseas. Thanks"
150551,wallacio,2008-01-14 01:01:00,475,Have a look at the Humminbird portable as well.  I've had mine for years and it goes with me everywhere from the cottage to Algonquin including ice fishing (works great...I prefer it over a flasher).   You can now buy an ice transducer as well as rechargeable gel cell batteries for it (they used to only accept costly lantern batteries unless you convert the unit to accept gel cells as I did with mine).  http://store.humminbird.com/sonar/500-seri...od407100-1.html
150571,Mike the Pike,2008-01-14 01:33:00,3421,  Danbo the Cuda 128 is 60 bucks and the 168 is $110 on sale.The number represents the mega pixels.2 of my friends haver the Cuda 168 on their 12 foot boats works very well.Both good deals for a small budget.  
150607,danbo,2008-01-14 03:09:00,2646,"Yep,I bought the Cuda for my kayak. It's got good reviews for a low cost unit! Fish on,Bro!"
151076,goober,2008-01-15 17:51:00,14,"So I have decided that I am going with the icemachine X67c and was wondering who has the best price. I just wanted to ask, for those that have this finder, does it show your lure well and are there any bad points? Thanks."
151079,Terry,2008-01-15 18:04:00,14456,well if you had clicked on the link I gave you would see a price of 299.99 and that's the best price in canada  that I have seen  and as long as you take the time to learn how to really use it you can see a little 1 inch. tube and 1/32 jig head and fish come up and bite it...you need to set the sensitivity and colorline just right and you can play with ping speed too  but I like mine in 10ft of water for perch and 90ft of water for trout..
151196,setomonkey,2008-01-16 01:17:00,872,"I've had the Fish Easy 2 for years and have had no problems, under $200 and very portable. I've put it on canoes, rental boats, the cottage tinny and have even packed it in my luggage a couple of times for trips I've taken after flying somewhere.  Mike"
151202,Gerritt,2008-01-16 01:21:00,6129,I know Jos  @ angler outfitters oi woodstock  had then on pretty cheap!  G
