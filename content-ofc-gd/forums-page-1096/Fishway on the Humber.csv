130626,dsn,2007-11-06 18:51:00,1018,I'm in the dark about this one just like you. I don't even know where in the humber its located. I would love to see the under water windows and watch fish swim up or down.   dsn
130709,fish_finder,2007-11-06 21:19:00,370,"I've heard of it.  Never been though.  Some friends have been there and commented on how 'neat' it was, I'd like to visit sometime but I'm usually fishing....which gets in the way of alot of things apparently!  Dave"
131535,Jon,2007-11-08 17:21:00,209,"The windows are covered up due to excessive algal growth but I have seen trout and shiners in there.  I have some video, which I may try and upload to utube sometime.  Palgrave is just south of Hwy 9 on Highway 50.  Jon"

151363,Jon,2008-01-16 17:32:00,209,I finally got around to uploading one of my videos.  This was taken through the viewing window:    I also have some underwater video using an Aquaview.   Jon
