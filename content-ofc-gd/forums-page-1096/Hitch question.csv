Thanks"
150917,Gerritt,2008-01-15 01:01:00,6129,"get the trailer level.. or resting a little back, back your truck up to the tongue and measure from the bottom of the receiver  should give you a good idea on the amount of drop required.  G"
150929,Fisherman,2008-01-15 01:45:00,7201,"Hmmm..  Trailers should ride level or slightly tongue end LOW, this prevents high speed sway/fishtailing."
150943,HTHM,2008-01-15 02:25:00,4082,"Phew, I thought you were thinking about getting married.......what fisherman said"
150946,Gerritt,2008-01-15 02:36:00,6129,  LOL! I meant that you want a bit of weight on the tongue... after re-reading it... doesnt sound that way..
150952,skeeter,2008-01-15 02:54:00,1907,"the standard towing height is 18"" off the ground!"
150957,vance,2008-01-15 03:13:00,719,"Height depends on the trailer,my shorelander's is 15-17 inches from the top of the ball.Check with the trailer manufacturer,they are all a little different.  vance"
150960,Cast-Away,2008-01-15 03:17:00,790,Call a reputable hitch place. They should be able to tell you the correct height.
