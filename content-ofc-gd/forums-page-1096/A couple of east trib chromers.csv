150712,Paulus,2008-01-14 15:52:00,522,"Well, it wasn't anything like my last trip with Solopaddler, and I almost packed it in early. I visited several tributaries yesterday morning only to find that most of the rivers and creeks were lower and clearer than I'd expected, and a heavy wind rose about mid morning to really chill the bones - all of which usually means ""go home.""  Luckily, the last river on my list was in perfect condition. I could tell, by the full parking lot & the heavily trampled shore, that it had been pretty well dredged. But I managed a couple, nonetheless, & I lost another.        Saw some geese, too.    Oh... and a ducky...    p.-"

150726,solopaddler,2008-01-14 16:49:00,8605,Nice fish buddy! Wish I could have made it out with you slow fishing or not.
150734,dobee,2008-01-14 17:12:00,301,very nice fish...
151102,Paulus,2008-01-15 19:24:00,522," Would've been nice, bud. You might have known to avoid the specific mistake I made in the early, early morning (i.e. fished the wrong spot on the right river) - otherwise, you missed a cold day... no biggie!  Before you know it, March will be here...  btw, a hunter buddy of mine says that the duck is a Bufflehead.  p.-"
151134,Bob,2008-01-15 21:27:00,370,"Nice fish!!  Your buddy is right, definitely bufflehead.  Back in the day, we called them butterballs.  Fat little ducks."
151139,drwxr,2008-01-15 21:54:00,453,"wow, i wish someone tought me how to fish these monsters."
151141,Paulus,2008-01-15 22:00:00,522, At first I thought he was calling ME that  They are shy little guys & seem to be good divers. One of these days I'll get a better camera & then I'll really deliver the shots  p.-
