U do realize these guys (myself included) fish for other species in bass boats other than just bass.  That could be the dumbest post I've ever read on a fishing forum.  Now if the were flipping docks and targeting bass on beds than of course its illegal but what you just stated is ridiculous.  There are idiots of all kinds in all kinds of rigs and from shore.

855964,The Urban Fisherman,2014-05-30 15:11:00,2050,"A spinnerbait is just flat out effective for walleye on Scugog. You are dealing with large flats with weed at or near the surface.  Inside weedlines on Rice, Tri Lakes,Strugeon can be awesome for walleye.  So just because it's a 70K bass boat fishing near shore doesn't mean they are fishing out of season.  Dude my dad caught his PB Walleye on Scugog casting a big muskie sized spinnerbait! lol   The only time he ever fished the lake! I  thought it was a total fluke but apparently not.  Not that I disagree with you Bushart, but a well know fishing celebrity on his TV show did a whole segment on flipping for Walleye. And it worked! I dont doubt for a second what your saying, but the problem like what has been mentioned is proving intent.  I wouldn't have believed it unless I was the one holding the video camera in my hands.... and I was.  ;o)  Anyone surprised?   I've seen guys in 70k rigged bass boats fishing a lake 2 weeks before opener...  Telling me at the ramp they were fishing pike, lol.   What a crock.  I agree %100 man that guys rigged out with their bass boats are probably out there doing it.. and as someone else pointed out there's people doing it in tinnys, canoes and from shore as well.  Dave used to fish crappie / walleye etc. out of a G3... nowadays he just sticks to his bass boat because he loves to fish out of it.  Crappie, Perch on small jerkabaits, walleye you namei t.... I'm sure one day we'll even end up doing a friggin trolling show out of the skeeter!  Imagine that thing with riggers on it!"
914643,jtracc,2015-05-11 18:16:00,97,"I remember last years May 1st walleye opener on the moon.  It was a Thursday and the ice just cleared out on the Tuesday. We had a great opener with 40-50 walleye... By the Friday mid morning the smallmouth showed up, for every 1 walleye we would hook up with 3 smallies.  We were all using a jig/ minnow combo, no matter what depth we drifted they would hit 10-40 fow.  The only way to stop catching them was to stop fishing period.  Now as an angler who is honest, when these walleyes slowed down late sat because they started to move into the sanctuary to spawn I could have stayed and kept catching smallies double headers per drift, but we didn't. We left the bay and looked for pike water.  So what was my option, I was clearly targeting walleye and yes we caught the more aggressive smallmouth but we where still catching eyes.  I don't think I should have to stop fishing or move."

As for the bass out of season, well, I consider them a coarse fish and a bit of a nuisance when fishing for other species, but that's a whole other story.  They are tasty critters though!"

855563,Old Ironmaker,2014-05-28 03:02:00,8243,"The joke is the $90.00 slap on the wrist. Any crime is all about risk and reward, I have been asked to produce my fishing license exactly twice in 30 years. Say the average is a fee of 20 bucks a year, that's about $600.00, even if I got nailed those 2 times I'm up $420.00, not a bad reward for very little risk. There are no teeth in any legislation in Ontario, whether under the criminal code or the MNR."

Its easy to see the intent if you watch  Everyone catches OOS fish now and then. On opening day of trout season I caught a gorgeous smallmouth, drifting a roe bag under a float. Sometimes, the fish don't know they're out of season so they hit anyway. Happens to all of us.  That said, when you're catching far more OOS fish than the species you're targeting (or say you're targeting), it's time to change tactics or move on."

855626,bare foot wader,2014-05-28 16:16:00,1354,"often times CO's will watch you before they approach you...they don't issue fines on intent (at least not for OOS issues), so if anybody got stuck with a fine for fishing OOS they certainly deserve it  we had them glass us for close to an hour, didn't realize they were CO's and got pissed strangers were watching us so long, as we packed up to move they came racing over...we checked out of course, and they did say they watched us and saw us release a few OOS bass, but we did catch some nice pike, they just asked if we catch a lot of bass to please move spots"
855647,grimsbylander,2014-05-28 19:55:00,3016,"This makes me wonder if the cost of patrolling CO's looking for people bass fishing is worth it. Stateside in NY they have the early season whereas it's artificial baits only as well as catch and release only. On Erie and Niagara they have the one fish limit if over 20"" season as well. Why is it the vast majority of the US has some sort of early season(or no closed season) which eliminates most of the shady bass fishing when here it is completely taboo? It's been like that there for decades with no real ill effects(?) and they're bass crazy down there! Their lake get pressured BIG time. Last weekend on the US side of Erie there are spots loaded with smallies that will produce 20-30 fish per angler/per day. It sure hasn't hurt the population. Why should a lake or river have seasons so vastly different from one side to another? Personally, I'd rather see money spent on the cleaning up waterways, combating invasive species or stocking as opposed to hiding in the bushes with binoculars trying to catch someone catching a fish he most likely won't harvest anyway. I think we're a little brainwashed into believing it's sacrilegious to target spawning bass for catch and release when there is a multitude of other species being legally targeted during their spawning cycles...and many of those go home on stringers and in buckets. Watching a beautiful rainbow trout get caught, milked for her eggs and released(or killed for table fare) while discussing the atrocities of catching a bass before the end of June seems more than a little screwed up to me. For years I always thought is had to do with the shorter summers(growing season) in Canada vs. the US. But with the no closed season in the north and the newly introduced longer season in zones 17,18 and 20 that negates that logic. So the further south you go, the shorter the season. Hmmmm. So if the late season is truly in place to protect the species during spawning, why is the same not true for all species? In 2012 the MNR stocked over 1.2 million rainbows, browns and Chinook plus 18,000 coho. At what cost? Is this required due to fishing pressure during the spawn, after the spawn, or both? In lakes that have smallmouth and lakers, the smallmouth have had a adverse affect on the lake trout's health. No problem, the MNR stocked over 3.6 million lakers in 2012. Strangely enough, we are working hard to protect the bass population as if it were somehow in trouble. I could not find evidence that 1 single bass was stocked in 2012. And our magnificent musky? Only 1053 stocked in 2012! I honestly don't care if they ever change the season, really I don't. I just think things seem to be a little out of whack as to where the money goes and why. Since I am not a biologist or a politician, I could be wrong. I'd just like to see some sound logic to substantiate it. Got on a bit of a roll there!!"
855651,davey buoy,2014-05-28 20:02:00,5505,Some valid points for sure.I just follow the calender and try to keep in a safe zone so to speak.What else can we do.
855674,Steve,2014-05-28 22:46:00,2075,"grimsbylander, I think rather than opening bass up for angling during the spawn, we should CLOSE all fishing for ANY species during the spawn.  i believe it is wrong to fish trout during the spawn, just as I feel it is wrong to fish bass during the spawn.  in regards to bass, the only anglers who want to fish bass during the spawn are lazy anglers, because bass are that easy to catch during the spawn....bass aren't hard to catch in the first place....at least compared to most other species....why we would need to open angling for them during the spawn it beyond me.....  also, bass anglers, like trout anglers, are often the most short sighted anglers out there.....  ""I only fish for bass"" or ""I only fish for trout""......  the main reason some bass anglers want to open bass year round is they rarely fish for anything else ... often only fishing for walleye if there is a tournament involved.  bass should remained closed during spawn.  other species should become closed during spawn.  those are my feelings....and yes, I fish bass likely as much as I fish salmon.....not many anglers are as comfortable in 2' of slop as they are in 200' of water with copper, wire divers, and riggers."
855681,grimsbylander,2014-05-28 23:15:00,3016,"Some interesting views Steve. I can't say as I agree with the blanket statement that bass anglers fishing during the spawn makes them lazy. That would indicate spring and fall trout anglers are also lazy which is also not true. It would also mean an entire nation of diehard bass anglers south if us are also lazy. If I've misread your intention, I apologize. I just don't think it's that cut and dried. I fish for bass every year during the spawn and I can assure you, I work hard at my sport. My intent wasn't to champion the cause to change the open season policies but to try to reason out why they are the way they are. Maybe you are right that if fishing for spawning bass is detrimental to the species it must also be true for all others as well and there should be no open seasons. But as devils advocate I wanted to point out that if it's not harmful for trout, salmon, perch, crappie, etc. in Ontario AND it's not harmful for bass in the US, why are we divided on policy and spending money on enforcing laws which are potentially redundant? Or maybe not?"
855686,Garnet,2014-05-28 23:40:00,2056,Musky are about the easy fish to catch.................Until you go after 50's  I caught 4 today.  Same with Bass easy to catch until you try for 4 in the 5lb category and a kicker at 6.6.  Fresh Steelhead are just stupid.

Many folks say bass are easy to catch....and its true, up to three lbs, they are an easy fish to catch. Great species to introduce children or newbies to. Overall a fun species to catch.  But catching big bass, five and six lbs'ers, that's a whole different story. Even the guys who fish big water, erie, simcoe, etc, have trouble consistently putting big bass in the boat....  That's why Bass is one of my favourite species to fish for."

Years ago, the CO was gunning for a friend of mine...he used to take too many fish and stuff and they just couldn't catch him.  Opening day of walleye one year they visited his camp and counted the carcasses in the garbage, charged him with over limit.  Now, everybody knows this won't stick.  He goes to court and the judge tosses it out.  On the way out he smiles at the CO and says he won...CO says oh really?  200 mile drive each way to court, a day off work with no pay..I get paid to be here..yup, you won alright.

The law says you cannot target bass at all until then.  Everyone knows in their heart if they are targeting bass or not, but its impossible to prove.  Even though this type of law creates a lot of on-line drama, and there are certainly those who blatantly break it ..... I think its a great law.  When bass season does open, there is a HUGE influx of boats and fisherman.  The lake gets pounded by bass fisherman all summer.  If the season were to be open (even C&R only) in early May, all those same fisherman would be there in force to wreak havoc on the spawn.  Even though it isn't a perfect law, it is the main reason the lake is such a good bass lake.  The law works."

I dont doubt for a second what your saying, but the problem like what has been mentioned is proving intent. Yup. They have been caught in 3 feet of water."

Having the money to buy that boat doesn't make them any more accountable as it does make them better fisherman. On the Niagara River, the MNR and OPP weave around and past bassboats to target tinnies and runabouts. There's a reason they do that too."
