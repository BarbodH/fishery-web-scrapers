914403,davey buoy,2015-05-09 18:02:00,5505,"Maybe just fined?,not enough IMO."
914409,Joeytier,2015-05-09 19:04:00,3990,"That must have been a hilariously awkward conversation.  Just like an episode of Cops...""That's not mine I don't know who put that there!"""
914410,FrankTheRabbit,2015-05-09 19:20:00,479,  I'd go out on a limb and say that it probably wasn't their first time committing said offense either.
914417,Big Cliff,2015-05-09 19:42:00,6899,"We had a conservation officer set up a stake out on the road here last winter as we had a couple of college students staying with us and they liked to go out ice fishing in the afternoon after school. It was really nice actually, sometimes there were 8 or 10 of them out there.  I guess he spent a few hours watching them from the road but I had already warned them what would happen if they did keep any walleye! (The conservation officer would have been the least of tyheir worries LOL).  They were super kids though and there was never any problem. It was still nice to see that someone was watching, wish we had more COs in the area."
