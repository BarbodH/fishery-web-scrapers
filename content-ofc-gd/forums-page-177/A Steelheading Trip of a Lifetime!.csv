Oh well, definitely throw a heads up next time you guys come down..........It'd be a pleasure to share a few drifts"
913984,Steelheadphycho,2015-05-06 14:53:00,470,That's fantastic!  I'll never forget my first steelhead........ And neither will they!  Thank you for sharing gentleman!!!

914083,The Urban Fisherman,2015-05-07 00:17:00,2050,"Hey guys!  Sorry, I've just now been able to get back to the computer.... Thanks for all the kind responses... Glad you all enjoyed the report!   Are you two guys playing match maker????????????? LOL  Great report Ryan.  Looks like the kids had a blast.  That's funny Brian... There would certainly be some perks to having Brendan as a son-in-law... his old man has a nice cottage up north.... and hey access to a couple of fly-in's per year wouldn't be to hard to handle either. lol  That was a joy to watch Mike. Great job on the video.  YES.. he keeps calling it a hack job... but I thought it was awesome.  Mike inspired me to use one of my gopro's on a head mount and film more the things I do with the kids... I never want to film them as that's what I do for a living... I'd rather enjoy the moments with them rather then watch through the lens.. but with a head mount GoPro I can do both...  The prelude story about how the trip came together was very entertaining as well, and I new it would only get better as it went on  Glad you liked it.. I had hoped at least one person would get a laugh out of it .. haha  Crappy day at work but that just put a smile on my face!!  What a great day with the kids you both had!  Burt  Glad to have made your day at work a better one! lol  It sure was an awesome day.  Wow, wonderful. fantastic times. Those tykes caught more Steelhead that day than I've seen in all my years of trying to catch my second ever Steelhead. Vunderbar.  Oh and the music to the video, (Enigma maybe) I was waiting for some Viking warriors to ride up the river in slow motion, do Vikings ride horses, the video was great too Mike.  Don't worry Old Iron... they've both caught more then I have in my lifetime as well.. and bigger ones to boot.. lol  The dropback hole will never be the same!   Awesome awesome!!!!   Kids looked like they had a riot!  (The dads didn't seem to have a bad time either!)  It is an awesome spot Bill... The kids did you steelheaders proud...and yes... us old guys enjoyed it as well..  This put a smile on my face  Right on bud!!! That's why we posted the report..."
914085,The Urban Fisherman,2015-05-07 00:27:00,2050,"Sooooooooo gnarly!!!!     Great report all.  Dude.. this is my new favorite pic... it's going up on the wall in my office for sure... )  Love seeing the kids out there getting into the steelhead action , great report !   Thanks man.. it's all about getting the kids out for me...  Is it just me, or do those kids look super competent for their age, very cool.  Lots of fish and no crowds, sounds like a great day.  Both of them started fishing as soon as they could hold a rod... Averie's first trip was in her stroller, casting for Pike from shore at Humber Bay Park...she was 7 days old.. lol  I was ""This close"" to running into you guys lol...........I picked up my nephew and his buddy with intentions of hitting the same water/same holes,  but they called an audible on me literally as we were driving and decided they wanted to fish inland streams. Oh well, definitely throw a heads up next time you guys come down..........It'd be a pleasure to share a few drifts   Ah bummer.. would have been cool to bump into you Blaque... I'll be on Mike to take us again in the fall or next spring so maybe then... I'm going to spring for a hotel room though so we don't have to get up at 2:30a.m.  That's fantastic! I'll never forget my first steelhead........ And neither will they!  Thank you for sharing gentleman!!!  Nooo problem... Actually it was my first ever steelhead as well.. prior to this trip I've only caught little shakers... and trolling out on the lake but I don't count those...  Wow, what a great report.  Put a smile on my face.   Excellent  Thank Joey.. glad to put a smile on your face!  Awesome.  Big ups to both you guys!!  Thanks Brah... Hope all is well with you, the miss and the little one."

913803,The Urban Fisherman,2015-05-05 21:04:00,2050,"Legendary steelheader, writer extraordinaire, the foremost authority on fly-in fishing adventures and THE worlds greatest dad...These are just a few ways I've heard people describe Mike Borger... But I sure as heck wouldn't call him any of those! lol  He is an awesome friend though, who has on several occasions offered to take me out steelheading for the better part of a decade.  Unfortunately, each and every year it seems as though the prime steel conditions coincide with me having a crap ton of stuff to do… Be it kids, the house or work I’ve just never been able to squeeze out a day or two.  This spring Mike and I had talked about finally getting out, and though I was hopeful, I had this gut feeling that once again the stars wouldn’t align.Early last week it was my son’s 6th birthday.  I had just finished what was likely my 8th or 9th beer… ( because who doesn’t get hammered at their son’s 6th birthday dinner lol ) and my phone went off.  It was Mike, and the coming Friday was going to be PRIME for steelheading on the US side of the border.  Mike not only offered to take me out, but also suggested I bring Averie along so we could both catch our first steelhead.Time passes, and all of our guests leave.  Typically, I ease into asking the wife if I can sneak out for a day of fishing… BUT thanks to the 12 or so beers I’d already thrown back that evening, I piped up and said “ Hun, I’m pulling Averie from school on Friday and we’re going steelheading in the US”… To my complete surprise she said “Sure, Averie would love that”.  I froze for a moment… slightly confused as to what had just transpired.  Was it the beer, or was this actually going to happen? lolAnyway, after dealing with a few things and ironing out most of the plans with Mike it was a go!  Late Thursday after getting in from 3 soccer practices, I give Mike one last call and he lays a doozie on me… we’re leaving early he says.  Ok no problem I’ve gotten up early to go fishing my entire life.  The plan, was to meet near Grimsby at 4:30 a.m.  I live 1.5 hours away from Grimsby. lol Mike realizes how far away I am from where we’re to meet and suggests 5 a.m. instead.  So we’re shooting for 5 a.m. but I still wanted to get there as early as we could so the alarm was set for 2:30 a.m.I wake up and load the car, am pretty well ready to go, then wake Averie up at 2:55 a.m.  We’re out the door and ready to hit the road a few minutes after 3 a.m. and Averie is taking the early morning like a champ.    Honestly, the entire day was amazing.  Mike took care of everything.  Rods, reels, tackle, bait, he drove, put us on fish, took pictures, filmed Averie catching her first ever steelhead, coached her the whole way through - you name it.  I could write up a complete breakdown of the day but it wouldn’t do it justice.  Writing is Mike’s area of expertise, not mine, so I’ll let the pictures tell the story.    I can't believe it took us this long to do it, and I'm %100 certain it won't take that long again. Averie and I both can't thank Mike and his son Brendan enough for the day trip. It's something we will remember for a long, long time. She won't stop talking about it, and is so stoked to have made a new friend in Brendan. He's a great kid, and lucky to have a dad who's happy to bring him along on so many fishing adventures. We owe you one brother!It really was just about the kids, but Mike and I managed some nice fish as well.  Hope you guys enjoy the pics!  The trail walking in....   Mike's son Brendan... great kid - Him and Averie were both a little shy at first but eventually hit it off and had a great day together.    Averie ready to rock..   And to the fish!!!!     FIRST EVER STEELHEAD!          We didn't get pics of all of our fish... some we just released ( sometimes unintentionally lol ) or Mike was up-stream with Brendan. Here's Brendan with one of those ones that escaped as we were getting the camera out... Poor kid was all ready for a photo and I was to slow with the camera...      We caught some of these guys to... Averie's PERSONAL BEST sucker! lol    one of mine..        The fight is on again...          Averie's second personal best for the day....      More pics to follow....."
