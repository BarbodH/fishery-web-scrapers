914691,chris.brock,2015-05-11 22:24:00,4053,"""water on the water, beer on the pier"", you're not a good role model Bunk"

914720,kickingfrog,2015-05-12 01:23:00,8333,"They all get prettier at closing time.  Nice job.  I went looking for 'em this spring and never even got a sniff, guess I need a case or two."

914726,mistaredone,2015-05-12 01:38:00,913,Ha ha ha!  That was awesome!  At first look I thought I'd beer my way on your boat.
914753,Moosebunk,2015-05-12 02:58:00,3970,"Thanks fellas!  And I thought you were a scotch kinda guy  Scotch for trout and other sophisticated fish.  Beer for brawlers, like gar and muskies.  What are you using to target gar?  live bait?  Learning over the years they'll take pretty well anything surface or just subsurface as long as it'll fit down their throats.  Finding them and presenting the offer is more key.  ""water on the water, beer on the pier"", you're not a good role model Bunk  No, no no Chris.  Duff beer does not want to hear this kind of negativity. So you're wrong. lol."
914762,wormdunker,2015-05-12 06:13:00,1711,Nice gar!  Is Duff available in Canada?  LOL!
