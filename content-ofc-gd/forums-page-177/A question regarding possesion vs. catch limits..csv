913870,Old Ironmaker,2015-05-06 00:19:00,8243,"We have booked a perch trip coming up on Erie. The daily catch limit in our case is 50 Perch with the proper license. As I understand it the possession limit is 100 perch. A few read the regulations for Erie as one can have a full possession limit at their place of residence and that includes temporary residence i.e. cottage rental. How does one transfer the properly and easily identified fish from the temporary residence to the permanent residence without being in violation of the regulations in so far as one will have 100 perch? Maybe. The same would go for any other species. I say I can only transport my daily catch limit, the others in the group disagree. I bow to the members here and their informed opinion and expertise. My email and voicemail to the Ministry remains unanswered.  I also told the crew once you start counting Chickens before they hatch is bad luck especially when talking about fish limits before they are caught!!!!  Thanks all,  Johnny Di."

You get to the cottage Friday at 4pm, start fishing catch up to your 50 fish. Next day you do the same, go home Sunday.   Number one thing to keep handy if you ever get stopped is a receipt for the rental outlining the days you were there.  Make sure you keep the fish or fillets easily countable, not in one great big lump, check the regs for that too."
913878,Old Ironmaker,2015-05-06 00:35:00,8243,For the first time ever in my life I might be wrong. Keeping a receipt for the accommodations would be something to have to prove you have been away for more than 24 hours.
913880,Sinker,2015-05-06 00:52:00,8692,"Yep keep a reciept, and make sure they are packaged properly, and easily countable.  S."
913890,Old Ironmaker,2015-05-06 01:29:00,8243,"Bottom left of page 7 of 2015 regs answers my own question, in clear English, I'm glad I don't make bets.  "" The possession limit is the number you are allowed to have in your possession on hand. in cold storage, in transit, or anywhere. Possession limits are the same as one days catch limit except where otherwise specified.""  I don't read anywhere where it talks about the definition of residence, it now says ""in transit or anywhere."" It would be up to you to prove you didn't catch them all in 1 day I guess. There are all kinds of scenarios that would be tough to prove they weren't all caught in 1 day. I.E. I own a cruiser and I have 100 perch on board per person with a license.  That's a topic for Winternet, thankfully it's fishing season. Making dropshot rigs tonight.  Note: The possession limit for Perch in zone 19 has changed this year. 50 fish catch limit for perch per day and 100 for possession limit with Sport Fishing License Tag.  Thanks all."

And he didnt believe my son had caught some(hes also status indian)  We had two fish over our limits(if my son was not native)  So I showed him the pictures of my son catching fish and that was that.  Just to add he was a very polite officer
914017,John Bacon,2015-05-06 19:26:00,3277,It would be up to you to prove you didn't catch them all in 1 day I guess.  Wouldn't it be up to them to prove that you did?
914028,Old Ironmaker,2015-05-06 20:32:00,8243,"John Bacon, we all know it is up to the Crown to prove one to be guilty in any criminal matter but in the real world we have to prove we didn't do whatever during an investigation so charges are not laid in the first place."
914047,kickingfrog,2015-05-06 21:22:00,8333,I think that's why for the most part it is now one day's possession versus the old 2 days possession that was the norm not that long ago.  Now (for the most part) if you have 1 fish over the daily limit they don't have worry about someone claiming some of the fish are from the previous day.
