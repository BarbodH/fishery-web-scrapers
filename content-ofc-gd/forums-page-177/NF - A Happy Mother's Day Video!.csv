I was trying to come up with something creative and different for my Mom, Mom-in-Law and wife this year.  Our entire little town was bombarded with an explosion of dandelions this week which reminded me of how I used to pick them for my mom as a kid.  My kids have done it time and time again for my wife Ginny and I thought it might bring back some memories for a lot of people so I came up with this idea.  Hope you all enjoy and have a great week!Cheers,Ryan & Claira  "
