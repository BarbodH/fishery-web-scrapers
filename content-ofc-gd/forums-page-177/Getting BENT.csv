Quite the day.I guess my buddy Ralph must have missed a few last winter!1  For some reason reminds me of that old limerick:  There was a young man from Kent whose rod was severely bent So, to save himself trouble he shoved it in double and instead of coming, he went!!  You're not from Kent, are you??"

Your rubber band system is genius . 13.5' rod plus rubber band= lotsa time, tome to react ☺  A couple of guys that are/were, members here do it. I just went with what they told me and havent looked back. They used rubber bands, (thats what I started with, til I had one break and thought I had the holly of holly strikes. Line was every where.LOL). Thought, why not use one of the hair bands I have from the mrs,s to tie the rods together. I  thought the mrs,s wouldnt mis a few of them, til I was asked why I had them on my rod..LOL"
