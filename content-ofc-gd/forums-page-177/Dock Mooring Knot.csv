914424,sneak_e_pete,2015-05-09 20:57:00,540,I want to learn how to tie my boat to a dock ring where the knot releases when pulled from the tag end....what is the name of this technique?  Thanks in advance!
914427,Fisherman,2015-05-09 21:40:00,7201,....what is the name of this technique?   Being lazy...  :rofl2:   It's called a tumble hitch. http://www.animatedknots.com/tumble/
914442,FishAbout,2015-05-10 00:03:00,106,Its a good temporary knot but will pull the knot tight over time and you have a fair bit of slack in the rope and boat may move around more then you want.
914443,Fisherman,2015-05-10 00:35:00,7201,"Yes in all honesty, I wouldn't leave the boat with that knot for any length of time unless it's just for launching and then getting underway.   I like the figure 8 over a cleat much more."
914470,mistaredone,2015-05-10 13:31:00,913,Or maybe your looking for the daisy chain knot?
914472,mistaredone,2015-05-10 13:35:00,913,"Takes 10 seconds to tie, 2 sec to undo, won't come undone and tides up the extra line. My go to for dock rings"
914482,Fisherman,2015-05-10 15:00:00,7201,Same thing as a tumble hitch.
914490,mistaredone,2015-05-10 15:27:00,913,Lol. Sorry about that. So your saying that knot tightens its self too much if left over time eh. I've never docked for longer than an over night. Good to know fisherman thanks
914492,Pigeontroller,2015-05-10 15:55:00,2793,Fancy knots don't make you a good boater...
914502,sneak_e_pete,2015-05-10 17:16:00,540,They dont have cleats where I go...just rings
914554,porkpie,2015-05-11 00:26:00,2521,"Some guys have obviously never had to deal with dock rings.  Best way I can describe it is put one loop inside another, tighten and repeat.  It's an easy knot to learn, but kinda hard to describe.  We use them all the time at the local government dock.  Can't say I've ever left a boat tied that way for more than 4-6 hours.  Our dock has cleats.  Nothing on YouTube?"
914594,Mister G,2015-05-11 10:50:00,1429,"When rings are your only option you can put the dock lead through the ring and back to the boat cleat, thus giving you twice as much holding power."
914598,DanD,2015-05-11 11:41:00,2223,"You sailors at heart will laugh at this; but I've always used good quality cambuckle straps. Remove the open hooks and replace them with carabiners. Two 2000lb rated straps/carabiners and your boat's not going anywhere. Even after some hard pulls on the straps, one push on the cam and the straps come loose; not like a rope, where you're fighting to get it untied after a knot has pulled tight.  Dan."
914612,AKRISONER,2015-05-11 13:56:00,5558,can anyone confirm how the chain sinnet is attached to the ring? Im guessing you simply wrap the first look around the ring?
914614,Fisherman,2015-05-11 14:10:00,7201,You got it and then leave a long enough tag so you can release it.
914615,mistaredone,2015-05-11 14:11:00,913,Send me your email via pm and I'll send you a 30 video that will show you how easy it is.
