914506,scugpg,2015-05-10 18:03:00,1373,I have a very minor scratch on the yammy but hoping to find a tube or touch up to cover up. Believe Yamaha only makes a spray can version now?? Don't want to go that route so looking for options for a match of something else that would work with the dark metallic silver in a tube and brush version similar to automotive stuff.  Anyone been through this?  Thanks

914593,DanD,2015-05-11 10:31:00,2223,If you can fine the paint in a rattle spray can; spray the amount you need into a small container and have at it with your brush.  Dan.
914779,Mister G,2015-05-12 10:34:00,1429,An old touch up paint trick is to spray a small amount of paint into the can's cap. Then tear off a paper match and use the torn off end as your paint brush. You're done without any clean up required and it works great to boot.
