913783,davey buoy,2015-05-05 19:38:00,5505,"One of the charter guys were plugging them on WFN. Very small,obviously used for shallow water.Interested to hear your feedback. Thinking it may come in handy on the way to a few spots.25' -50' deep may be the depth for the most part of the run. Very hard to get a crank bait down that far for the most part without a down rigger.This area always shows fish near the bottom and half way up. Our bigger Dipsy's  would hit bottom for sure.Thinking maybe a nice alternative?"
913791,Thrilla,2015-05-05 20:18:00,164,"Yep they have a time in place here on lake erie for suspended fish, they are weighted so making a turn can slow them or speed them up and entice a strike, we run them typically off planer boards for walleye/steelhead"
913796,Old Ironmaker,2015-05-05 20:40:00,8243,Exactly what Thrilla said above. Great for shallower fish this time of year. Snap weights as well. I wish I could remember where both of mine are.
913797,davey buoy,2015-05-05 20:43:00,5505,"Thanks guys,how deep do they go on average?."
913801,outllaw,2015-05-05 20:53:00,1232,we used to run the little dollar dipseys on down dive. put them out on planer boards with small flutter spoons. great on erie walleyes/rainbows.

914171,Steve,2015-05-07 19:18:00,2075,"they are ok.  they don't have a lot of surface area, so they really ""kick out"" easily, and can cut across other lines.....  i believe big jon also makes a set...and these ones ""plane""...but they sure dont...not enough surface area..instead they twist and twirl, screwing up your line.  i personally believe snap weights work much better when fishing water depths less than 40'."

Good to know Steve,now I need to look up snap weights and how to use them lol.Maybe that is a better way to go?."

I have a couple of those---I should look at that too. I guess it's no big trick but  can't be bothered figuring it out when I'm fishing."
914185,dave524,2015-05-07 20:33:00,4508,"Luhr Jensen Jet Divers in the small size and 5 colour lead core rigs are good choices off of fixed planer boards, probably could use inlines too, for fishing the twenty foot range instead of dipseys."
914189,davey buoy,2015-05-07 20:42:00,5505,"Thanks guys,as a side note ,I attached a snap swivel to my lead core line.Used a clinch knot ,something similar as you would for braid or other lines.Is that the way to go?Seems to be tight.27lb test .Last thing I want to do is lose my dipsy and everything because of a bad knot."
914191,porkpie,2015-05-07 20:46:00,2521,Snap weights way better for shallower water.  Can't get much easier to use either.  I love big dipseys but I wouldn't bother with those little buggers either.  Easier ways to skin the cat!
914224,BillM,2015-05-07 23:44:00,17367,"I'd be jigging up early season lakers on Simcoe to start, then break out the trolling gear.  10ft off bottom, zipzag, you'll boat a few before they get sulky in July, lol."
