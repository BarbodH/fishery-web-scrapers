913816,kickingfrog,2015-05-05 21:37:00,8333,My son found a flatfish with the double treble hook hanger. The hanger was broken and when I put a single treble on it didn't run correctly. I did a web search and didn't find any place to buy them and figured someone here might know where to get some.  Seems silly but when you're 6 and find a lure it's kind of a big deal.

913825,aplumma,2015-05-05 22:17:00,6896,You can strip one off of another lure you get from a discount store possible?  Art
913853,esoxansteel,2015-05-05 23:32:00,1307,"Should work fine, I remove all the spreaders and replace with single trebles, with no issues, check the eye, to make sure its straight, and bend it opposite to the direction it wants to run, most flatfish do have a snap, to allow it to swing and wobble more, make sure it is not bent or damaged as well, drop back steelhead are suckers for flatfish"

913925,irishfield,2015-05-06 02:35:00,26272,Thanks Dave... I'll have a look tomorrow when I get to the shop.
913927,SirCranksalot,2015-05-06 02:39:00,3291,"I have 1 or 2 of those(Or are they Kwikfish?) and find that hanger thing to be a PITA, esp if using a landing net."
913928,DRIFTER_016,2015-05-06 02:42:00,10439,Thanks Dave... I'll have a look tomorrow when I get to the shop.  There are different sizes for different sized flatfish. See the link I posted.
913930,irishfield,2015-05-06 02:47:00,26272,Well I'll dump out my box of them and see what variety is there for Rob to chose from. Might even be the same colour and size and he could do an easy swap on the kid...
913933,DRIFTER_016,2015-05-06 02:50:00,10439,
913972,kickingfrog,2015-05-06 12:32:00,8333,Thanks I'll take a look at the bucket. I appreciate that Wayne.
914002,irishfield,2015-05-06 16:25:00,26272,Out of the whole mess of them.. I have 5 with the double treble.. in 3 sizes. Will get a picture up later this afternoon.
914006,irishfield,2015-05-06 17:43:00,26272,Here's what I've got Rob..
914044,kickingfrog,2015-05-06 21:16:00,8333,"Wow! It's been a long time since I've seen the smaller ones with the double treble hooks. His is an X4 size, likely the larger ones would do. I've found some other trebles that might work as well. I'll report back after our next outing."
914072,irishfield,2015-05-06 23:09:00,26272,Okay.. let me know and you know where to find me... if I'm still here!
914075,kickingfrog,2015-05-06 23:22:00,8333,A trip north wouldn't be a bad thing.
914076,irishfield,2015-05-06 23:25:00,26272,Another option... I can give it to the younger daughter next time she comes bumming a meal and have her leave it in the box of the Sporttrac. She works for Ted Handy Architects.. right by the liquor store off Dunlop St downtown.
