914256,FishOn,2015-05-08 02:34:00,136,Need some help with this statement from a 1999 Lund boat catalogue .  States that a Lund Pro Sport  .063 freeboard .08 hull .08 twin plate.  Does this mean from bow to maybe mid point of the boat has 2 x .08 thick plates of aluminum? ​For a total of 1.6 thickness  for the bottom?  Thanks

But I think you have the correct interpretation."
914265,irishfield,2015-05-08 04:39:00,26272,Yep.. two .08's sandwiched and riveted together (like plywood) is stronger than a single layer of 0.16.
914330,FishOn,2015-05-08 20:16:00,136,"Correction .063 freeboard .08 hull .063 twin plate.  Awesome two plates of .063 each at the bow,  I will take them .  Thanks Lund."
914372,tomkat,2015-05-09 02:35:00,246,Or is it .08 with .063 on top of it. That's what I thought mine is?
914701,FishOn,2015-05-11 23:41:00,136,That sounds about right.
