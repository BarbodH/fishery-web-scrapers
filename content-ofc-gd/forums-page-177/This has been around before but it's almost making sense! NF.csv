914182,Big Cliff,2015-05-07 20:17:00,6899,"Dear Mr. Harper, Trudeau, MulcairPlease find below our suggestion for fixing Canada 's economy.Instead of giving billions of dollars to corporations that will squander the money on lavish parties and unearned bonuses, use the following plan.You can call it the Patriotic Retirement Plan:There are about 10 million people over 50 in the work force. Pay them 1 million dollars each severance for early retirement with the following stipulations:1) They MUST retire.Ten million job openings -unemployment fixed 2) They MUST buy a new car.Ten million cars ordered -Car Industry fixed 3) They MUST either buy a house or pay off their mortgage - Housing Crisis fixed 4) They MUST send their kids to school/college/university - Crime rate fixed 5) They MUST buy $50 WORTH of alcohol/tobacco a week .....And there's your money back in duty/tax etcIt can't get any easier than that!P.S. If more money is needed, have all members of parliament pay back their falsely claimed expenses and second home allowancesAlso..How about putting the very elderly pensioners in jail and the criminals in a nursing home..That way the pensioners would have access to showers, hobbies and walks. They'd receive unlimited free prescriptions, dental and medical treatment, wheel chairs etc and they'd receive money instead of paying it out. They would have constant video monitoring, so they could be helped instantly, if they fell, or needed assistance. Bedding would be washed twice a week, and all clothing would be ironed and returned to them.A guard would check on them every 20 minutes and bring their meals and snacks to their cell.They would have family visits in a suite built for that purpose.They would have access to a library, weight room, spiritual counselling, pool and education.Simple clothing, shoes, slippers, PJ's and legal aid would be free, on request.Private, secure rooms for all, with an exercise outdoor yard, with gardens.Each senior could have a PC, a TV, radio and daily phone calls.There would be a board of directors to hear complaints, and the guards would have a code of conduct that would be strictly adhered to.The criminals would get cold food, be left all alone and unsupervised. Lights off at 8pm, and showers once a week. Live in a tiny room and pay $300.00 per week and with little hope of ever getting out.More points of contention: [Think about this...]COWSIs it just me, or does anyone else find it amazing that during the mad cow epidemic our government could track a single cow, born in Alberta years ago, right to the stall where she slept in the barn?And, they even tracked her calves to their stalls. But they are unable to locate 125,000 illegal immigrants wandering around our country. Maybe we should give each of them a cow.It is time grumpy old folks of Canada spoke up!"

914264,limeyangler,2015-05-08 04:10:00,5204,"10,000,000 x 1,000,000 = 10,000,000,000,000  Ten trillion or roughly 5 x Canada's GDP."
914274,Mister G,2015-05-08 11:45:00,1429,"10,000,000 x 1,000,000 = 10,000,000,000,000  Ten trillion or roughly 5 x Canada's GDP. Now there you go again, using logic when there's no need for it........."
914279,BillM,2015-05-08 12:22:00,17367,All the criminals are now going to college?  lol
914281,woodenboater,2015-05-08 12:55:00,2277,"interesting but obviously not feasible imo. all depends on where one lives but by the time you buy a house, car etc, you could very well be left with nothing or maybe half a million or maybe more ? that's not enough if forced to retire at 50.  just give me the million nsa and I'd be happy to take that buyout lol"
914283,limeyangler,2015-05-08 13:11:00,5204,"Now there you go again, using logic when there's no need for it.........  can't help it…i'm half vulcan."
914315,netminder,2015-05-08 17:18:00,514," can't help it…i'm half vulcan. I think someone over 50 just wants $1,000,000... lol"
914343,Fisherman,2015-05-08 21:39:00,7201,"And, all the criminals would be automatically inscripted into the army as they have a hankering for shooting others.  Send them to the war zone, lots of free ammo and have at it."
914461,Joeytier,2015-05-10 11:22:00,3990,Because anyone with a criminal record is a bloodthirsty maniac?
914464,Fisherman,2015-05-10 11:56:00,7201,"Because anyone with a criminal record is a bloodthirsty maniac? Oh get with the program, you know what I mean, the armed criminals."
