914501,icefisherman,2015-05-10 17:02:00,952,"When at the launch yesterday I noticed while squeezing the primer ball fuel spitting out of the throttle body of my 2000 Suzuki DT115 fuel Injection motor. It came out of the small hole in the picture below. Run it to the spot and back and motor run fine otherwise. Just tried the same exercise in my garage again and when squeezing the ball no fuel came out this time. What could be the reason? Just some gumming after the winter storage that burnt out on its own after running it or is it something I should be worried about and take it to Suzuki outboard mechanic? Anything I can do myself to prevent this from happening again? Thanks.      Cheers, Ice Fisherman"
