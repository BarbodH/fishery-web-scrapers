I'm 99% sure I caught 3 white suckers today at a local creek but I have a question for a smaller fish I caught that looked like a spawning common shiner but it's a toss up...not very sure on it.  My mom came out with me today and took some neat action shots and photo's haha. It was a first day back home after a year at fleming.  Here is the fish I'm not 100% sure about. Caught it(as well as the others) on corn this morning. Here is a picture of the fish.   Sucker time...enjoy      My favorite haha     The big 18""r         Not to sure why but this fish was bleeding a but from the anal...didn't look to healthy.    Thanks for viewing, MTBF  Also, I got the coordinates from google maps but I need to include a photocopied UTM map of each location in this project...any idea where I can find something online that's free...google is my enemy lol"
