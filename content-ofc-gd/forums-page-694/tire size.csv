459649,archer379,2010-04-25 22:57:00,277,Wondering if anyone knows anything on tire sizes if so my boat trailer has a 175 80 13. there is a member with a 180 80 13 for sale. Would this tire be close enough for me to use as a spare?
459656,Ron,2010-04-25 23:23:00,1683,"The 170 - 180 is the height profile. The 70 is a width profile. The 13 is the rim size.  As for using it as a spare, shouldn't be a problem so long as you have enough space between the rubber and fender. 180 profile is probably about 1"" +- higher than the 170. More importantly is the amount of plys, this will dictate the load and air pressure the tire will accept."
459658,SlowPoke,2010-04-25 23:26:00,2984,"175 80 13  175 is the section width in millimeters 80 is the sidewall profile (80% of tread width or 140mm) 13 is rime size in inches.  A 180 80 13 tire is 5 mm wider and 4mm taller.  If you already had one of these tires as a spare, I wouldn't throw it out but don't spend hard earned money on the wrong tire.  **Edited tread width with section width. Section width is actually the widest point of the tire... sidewall to sidewall."

Oh, and I don't think they make 180's they are 185."
