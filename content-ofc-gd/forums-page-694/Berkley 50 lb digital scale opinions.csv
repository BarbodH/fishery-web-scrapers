459113,FisherMike,2010-04-23 21:48:00,108,i just picked up this berkley digital scale and was wondering what some of your opinions are on it.  it was the only scale in the store i went to and i need it for fishing tommorrow so i didnt have much choice.  are they fairly accurate??  any problems with them??  thanks
459116,GBW,2010-04-23 21:50:00,8460,Not bad but if the battery gets low it's off.
459152,Joey,2010-04-23 23:53:00,9122,"It works okay for us.  Hard to make it change from Kilos to lbs when you're hurrying to get a fish back in the water tho.  Seems to default to kilos, then we have to do head math  Joey"
459154,PERCHER,2010-04-24 00:09:00,787,The only thing I dont like about mine is the hook is too small>but that will be modified this summer.Other than that no complaints.
459155,Roy,2010-04-24 00:09:00,13728,"The fundamental question is, why do you want/need to weigh fish?"
459159,PERCHER,2010-04-24 00:18:00,787,during the salmon derby not wanting to bring in any fish that wont make number 1
459161,Roy,2010-04-24 00:24:00,13728," OK, that makes sense. Thanks."
459175,lookinforwalleye,2010-04-24 00:57:00,4399,I had one I think it worked once!!
459235,raptorfan,2010-04-24 04:10:00,126, Maybe also so you don't come on here and get totally flamed and embarassed for over estimating the weight of a fish......
459238,waterwolf,2010-04-24 04:24:00,556,"a pre-spawn pike of 36 in. weighs ?,, a summer pike of 36 in. weighs ?  just a fishermans insight into life-cycles for me. also a sense of a healthy waterbody from one lake /stream to another,, and why/?"
459262,fish_fishburn,2010-04-24 12:12:00,1311,It's a good scale for the money. But my old Berkley was more accurate. We use them for bass tourneys Roy. The 50 lb scale I use now usually weighs a tad on the light side compared to most weigh in scales. I find if you tare it before weighing anything you get a more accurate reading.
459279,Uncle Buck,2010-04-24 14:26:00,1000,"for an accurate scale you need to pay some good $$  from my research (online, which doesn't mean much...)  the spring scales are more accurate...  also buy a scale with the range the fish is in...  example if you're bass fishing... don't go and buy a 0-50 scale... get a 0-20...  again, these are things that i've read and that is what i've come up with...  i ended up with a 0-60 rapala lock n weigh...  tackle tour did a review of the 0-20  http://www.tackletour.com/reviewrapalagrip20.html  solid product!!"
459364,Whitespinnerbait,2010-04-24 22:01:00,2038,  Good one
459372,FisherMike,2010-04-24 22:40:00,108,"thanks for the info everyone.  i just got in after a day of being skunked so i didnt even get to use it.  oh well, maybe next time."
459382,Fisherpete,2010-04-24 23:30:00,1814,"I have the 50lb Berkley digital scale, and tested it for accuracy with a number of weights when I first bought it - I found that it was accurate to within two or three ounces for items up to 20 pounds. Make sure that you tare it before each weighing."
459400,Carp,2010-04-25 00:15:00,1488,"I've had a Rapala digital scale for years. I used to use it when salmon fishing the tournies. If the fish wasn't large enough to enter for prizes, it went back right away. I didn't agree with lifting a fish vertically that may be released, but did what I had to to participate in the tourny. Weighing the fish in a cradle would be better, but I never had a cradle, so did the best I could with what I had.  It works very well and is accurate, but if you bang it around or keep putting heavy weight on it, it could be off a few ounces. I found that it was off by 2 to 4 ounces on a 30lb, salmon. Not bad. Had it replaced and the new one I have has hardly been used."
459497,wormdunker,2010-04-25 12:41:00,1711,"I love my digital scale.  When I first received it I took it to our local butcher shop & the owner compared a couple of pieces of meat on his scale versus my new digital.  Mine is very accurate to his scale!!  I also use it for other things such as weighing the amount of fertilizer to put on my lawns.  Scotts recomends 3lbs of fertilizer per 1000 square feet.  Very simple - put the fertilizer in a pail, weigh it & I'm good to go.  Don't forget to subtract the weight of the pail (tare).  Also weighing sausage when we're making up our home made pork sausage in January.  Shows me how much waste there is in a pork shoulder after weighing the finished product.  Enjoy your new toy!!"

459561,Photoz,2010-04-25 17:26:00,792,"I've had my Berkly digital for about 6 years . . .   dead on for accuracy . . .   .     only ONE big drawback . . . .   .   unless they have fixed the problem, you (if you read ALL the instructions) will find it won't work well BELOW about 3 degrees and there is a warning NOT to use it below 0 degrees. We had a kerfuffal a few years ago (I got flamed for suggesting this) until Speil actually called the distributor and found I WAS correct! I just checked mine, been in my SUMMER tackle box since October . .   still works fine . . .  ORIGINAL battery!"
459628,moemoe,2010-04-25 21:50:00,352,"I used the berkley scale but went through 2, the screen comes on, but no weight would register, I switched to the matzou 50lb scale and it is much nicer, easier to switch pounds and kilos, nice back light, and all for 30 bucks at CT"
