459650,johnl,2010-04-25 22:59:00,197,I caught a small brown and a small brook trout today the browns tail looked like it had the top clipped off is this a common place to clip a fish?
459677,kickingfrog,2010-04-26 00:24:00,8333,I have never heard of a tail being clipped before. Was it worn? Top or bottom of tail?
459687,johnl,2010-04-26 00:39:00,197,"it was the top of the tail, looked to clean cut to be torn but who knows"
459688,johnl,2010-04-26 00:40:00,197,o ya and brookies are delicious
459711,chris.brock,2010-04-26 01:05:00,4053,"pretty sure they don't clip the caudal (tail), it may hinder the fish, pectoral or pelvic fins are the ones usually clipped"
