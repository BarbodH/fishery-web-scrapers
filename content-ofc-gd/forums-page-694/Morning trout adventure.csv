459349,bill smy,2010-04-24 21:25:00,31,Well I woke up at 5:30 am and decided to go to a trib 30 mins away.  When i arrived it was zoo of fishermen. Very few steelies and tons of fishermen.  I decided to leave and go to my local river 5 mins from my house for some brownies. Had a blast with not one fisherman in sight.  Caught maybe 20 little trout and a couple over 10 inches. Most caught on the fly with bead head nymphs some others were caught with little spinners.  This is just a was a sample of one of many fish caught today.
