459465,Paully,2010-04-25 04:58:00,712, Sounds like the day me and my buddy had.. lets see some pics..
459480,solopaddler,2010-04-25 10:50:00,8605,"Sounds great, glad to hear you did well!"
459505,limeyangler,2010-04-25 13:14:00,5204,"Good stuff Vinni...look forward to some pics.  If your running a pc and have microsoft office,  open the pictures with microsoft office picture manager (right click on picture, select 'open with' , select 'microsoft office picture manager'. Once in program select 'edit pictures' at the top of the screen in the middle, this opens a side bar on the right hand side of the window, at the bottom of the side bar you should see 'Change picture size' click on 'resize' and choose the size you want.  Another way to do it would be slide show stylee, again if you are running a PC you should have 'windows movie maker, you can import all the pictures into the program, drag them into the time line in whatever sequence you choose, and when the program 'publishes' the finished project it will compress the file size automatically.  Probably some more advanced puter users could do it easier, but it works for me.  hope this helps."

459540,limeyangler,2010-04-25 16:16:00,5204,"  No problem....sounds like you should try the 'windows moviemaker' suggestion i made, you could do a slideshow of all of the pictures, add comments,music etc...et voila."
