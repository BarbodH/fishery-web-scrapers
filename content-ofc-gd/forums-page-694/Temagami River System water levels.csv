He claims Red Cedar Lake has many ""ponds"" that used to be bays.  Someone else said the forest fire hazard is way high too. Any observations/reports?"

459133,Muskieman,2010-04-23 23:01:00,2472,Dangerously LOW!!!!  Red Cedar was at least 6 feet low last week.... Temagami River is usually suicide at this time of year but can be walked across in some spots that my kids swim in.  If we get no or little rain I would foresee a Fire Ban for opener.  RFS 
459249,singingdog,2010-04-24 10:13:00,1047,"Yes, the Temagami system - along with every other river system that I know of - is very low. A low snowpack, fast early melt and virtually no rain in March and April have reduced levels to record lows on many systems. I have been updating water levels on a whitewater site for about 15 years and have never seen levels like this."
