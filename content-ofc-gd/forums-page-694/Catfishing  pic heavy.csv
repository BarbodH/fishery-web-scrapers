459374,Daplumma,2010-04-24 22:55:00,1961,"Took the big boat out today for a shakedown and some Catfishing.Cloudy,drizzley 55F perfect weather for cats. Here she is,made it thru the winter,45 inches of snow at one point.Kept Art on his toes keeping here afloat.   First order is to get some bait...Shad!Set out the gill net.  Pull in the net.  Bait!  Both captains plotting the course  First mate setting up  Quick run to the good spot.   Fish on,Pops gets into one.Sadly this will be the only kitty.The big Blues are spawning so they are not out now.This is a respectable Channel though.   One little striper came out to play,well under the 28""limit.  Some scenery.    The End "
459375,irishfield,2010-04-24 22:57:00,26272,THANKS Joe!!! Like a breath of fresh air...
459378,Fisherpete,2010-04-24 23:15:00,1814,"Very cool! Catching the bait first is half the fun isn't it... stripers are on my future to catch list. I watched a fishing show not too long ago (Fish'n'Canada) where Pete Bowman was catching huge stripers with an 18"" long eel-like lure."
459405,Daplumma,2010-04-25 00:51:00,1961,"They called them surgical eels back in the 70's.Surgical tubing with hooks.Umbrella rigs and big white plastic shads thumping along behind the boat work.Not a lot of fun though,unless you can stop the boat and figh tthe fish.Mostly its dragging dead weight behind a trolling boat.Catching them upriver on a pike weight rig with minimal weight is an epic battle.Hope you get a chance to catch one.Exellent table fare. Joe"
459470,SlowPoke,2010-04-25 07:57:00,2984,"Great report Joe! I'm glad you and Art got out with the ""Chief of Staff""! I had my official Kitty Cat Hat on today too....  "
459481,Daplumma,2010-04-25 10:57:00,1961,Most exellent fish there...and hat. Joe
459486,Spiel,2010-04-25 11:05:00,9065,"A great day on the water with your Pops and brother. Good to see a southern report, thanks Joe."
459487,Roy,2010-04-25 11:32:00,13728,"What a great report, Joe! ummmm tell your brother that he should be INSIDE the boat. Looks like a wonderful day for you guys."
459489,Rich Clemens,2010-04-25 12:02:00,3131,Lookin' good guys.   Be seeing ya all real soon.
459506,limeyangler,2010-04-25 13:19:00,5204,"fantastic report! catch your own bait....love it!  also good to see a seafishing report, i am assuming you are fishing the ocean with the striper you caught.  Anyway...great report, your boat is cool too, my father in law used to run something similar out of Eirieau, Ontario.  Great looking cats, and the striper had me remembering going out with my sabiki feathers, catching live sandeels, and 'bubble floating' live bait for sea bass back in England.  Thanks for posting."
459522,Daplumma,2010-04-25 14:59:00,1961,This was the Potomac river about 10 miles south of Washington DC.Tidal and mostly fresh water.The Stripers are born in fresh and go out to sea.This one has not been to the ocean yet.They return to spawn this time of year and then the big one come in.Art has a license for the gill net and its his boat.He has the cats dialed in on that part of the river. Joe
459525,aplumma,2010-04-25 15:18:00,6896,  Great.... The one time I decide to walk on water and Joe posts it on the internet.   Art
459573,douG,2010-04-25 18:12:00,2693,"Yay team Melancon!  Great to see the southern contingent wetting some line.  I have a trip planned wif me bruvvah and Pa soon too.  These times are treasured, and so few.  Thanks for those pictures.  Slowpoke, that fish deserves its own thread!"
