451050,misfish,2010-04-02 20:48:00,29133,"Looking forward to the finish.I still think,IMO,you should use what nature has in the bush to cover that hunting hut of yours."
451060,Terry,2010-04-02 21:43:00,14456,for a minute I thought you were looking after blind deer.... NOW THAT'S A PROJECT  oh well this is good too....  LOL

451088,waterwolf,2010-04-02 23:30:00,556," why not pre-cut and build on site . must be a huge pain getting the stand to locatrion , no? scent and noise be the same?"
451096,Leecher,2010-04-02 23:39:00,7832,"======================================================================= UPDATE =======================================================================  Been busy again today.... added the window and bench..... you'll probably notice green dots on the inner side of the studs.... those are the screws that need to be undone when I'm ready to disassemble it  Was a real hot day on the deck and got myself a good burn on the neck     Here's the vid Enjoy!!!

451099,Leecher,2010-04-02 23:55:00,7832,Thanks waterwolf!!! but only thing I see in your reply is my quote
451113,Leecher,2010-04-03 00:25:00,7832, Don't ask me why but I can see your reply now    This is just a preliminary to see how it fits together.... Getting out to the spot will be pretty easy with a 4x4 bike and trailer.  I'll be about 300 yards from the deer feeder.... I'll have a pretty good view of it  As for scent and noise... will be setting it up ASAP so that they (the deers) get used to seeing it in their environment  Thanks again waterwolf!!!
451131,waterwolf,2010-04-03 00:50:00,556,"just asking from an ignorant point of view. i hunt exclusively from hang-on archery stands.if you have the means ,,, ofcourse build it at home!!just looking for your perspective . look forward to seeing the finished product. by the way , always enjoy your posts 'bout hunting."
451163,Leecher,2010-04-03 01:22:00,7832, Thanks again waterwolf!!!  I know that you hunt with a bow.... must be the ultimate feeling when faced with a deer in close range.  Just talking about it get's me all pumped up     I'll make sure to take some footage when I set it up in the bush.... I'm pretty sure you'll enjoy the view from my vintage point
451211,waterwolf,2010-04-03 02:35:00,556,always a pleasure talking to another hunter with his sights on the right targets. posts are always a good read.
451510,Leecher,2010-04-04 02:45:00,7832, Right on dude!!!  Thanks again
451589,troutboy,2010-04-04 14:23:00,125,Looking good! Cant wait till its all done!
451849,Leecher,2010-04-05 01:24:00,7832, Thanks again troutboy!!!  I've worked on it today and added some more hardware.... uploading new pics.... stay tuned
451868,Leecher,2010-04-05 01:55:00,7832,"This morning visited my brother to see how his deer blind was coming along..... he's almost finished, his is built differently then mine and to tell you the truth.... I prefer mine  I took the opportunity to take some plexiglas off his hands and when I got back home got busy building window frames, I even changed the front window to open from the top instead of the bottom.... made sense and gives me more room when I stand up  Here's one of the little window I made in the doorway.  You can't see the plexiglas but trust me it's there    The other side    From the inside.... and you can see the reflection in it    Other side    This is the other window I added    From the inside.... I ran out of wing nuts so I had to improvise    I switched the hinges from the top to the bottom so that the window, when open, rest on the stud at the bottom    Moved the wing nuts to the top    On the next two pics is the windows opened      That is it for now   If it's not raining tomorrow, might work on the door so stay tuned for some more.  Tight lines Leechman"

452969,bushart,2010-04-07 12:03:00,2628,This is hi-tech Jacques--looks great  My version of a blind was break some spruce boughs and put them on the ground and sit under the tree
453138,wallyboss,2010-04-07 18:52:00,1095,"It's going to be a real nice Deer Blind.  But why would you have a big round table, a recycle bin and a big BBQ in it????         Kidding!!!"
453144,anders,2010-04-07 19:12:00,1168,"Very Cool!   im to lazy to build, would rather buy.  I should give you an order...i know a couple guys up here that would buy that!  Nicely done"
453243,Leecher,2010-04-08 00:20:00,7832, Thanks Terry!!!  This will be my first time in a blind in over 30 some years of hunting.... it's going to be quite cozy in there   Thanks Dan!!!   Thanks anders!!!  First time undertaking such project and I'm quite pleased with the results so far     Now I just can't wait to get to the painting stage  Stay tune for some more!!!
