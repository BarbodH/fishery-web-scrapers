They are in there somewhere......i tried on the ice and got one nice 13"" one......but have been unsuccessful finding them in any numbers. As it started to get darker a few big arcs on the fishfinder would come up and check the bait...but would not take. I tried everything from slip bobbers to the same jigs i use on the ice, small rapalas (suspending), beetlespins, leeches(gulp), those tube jig things with the feathers at the end, minnows , northland minnow jigs, but nada, zip, zilch....lol   I headed back home feeling frustrated but the awesome sunset soothed my mood and ironed out my somewhat furrowed brow....cant beat the NW Ontario sunsets.....

458978,limeyangler,2010-04-23 13:43:00,5204," LOL...just looked at the vid...it does have a flying feel to it...makes the boat look like its fast too......really shes the slowest hunk of junk in the galaxy.     It sure is Blue Lk, are'nt you out on blue lake hammering the lakers yet?...come on...what ya waiting for!    Tis true Bruce..... the black flies are a pain. Not so bad when out in the boat around where we are....the real annoyance are the 'ankle biters'....they look like regular house flies but bite the hell outta your ankles...they can bite right through socks too....some days the boat is full of them....and they just sit on the hull when you move so they are ready to snack again when you stop....no geting away from them...lol.    lemme know when your up this way....might get out in a boat together"
