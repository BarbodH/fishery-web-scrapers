459038,TC1OZ,2010-04-23 17:23:00,987,"Muggy Weld :  http://www.muggyweld.com/5clip13.html   Vs.  Dura Fix  http://www.durafix.com/   From what I can tell they are the exact same thing, except that Muggy Weld requires a separate flux while the Dura Fix has the flux in the rod... I assume.  Does anyone have experience working with either? Which is the superior product?  :D"
459070,Terry,2010-04-23 19:03:00,14456,"well just from what I see in their ads...Muggy Weld will do a superior job as you need an oxyacetylene torch and the other uses a propane torch, which may be fine and the Muggy may be over kill for what you need..but Muggy finished product should be better....... "
459080,TC1OZ,2010-04-23 19:24:00,987,Thanks for noticing that Terry. The video claims you just need a propane torch... Where exactly did you see that? Or do you just know what type of torch they were using?
459081,Terry,2010-04-23 19:25:00,14456," it's right under the video here is a cut and paste Tami uses an oxyacetylene torch and Super Alloy 5 to weld a hole in an aluminum boat. Although we recommend cleaning the area first for best results, you will notice that the oxidation on the aluminum was not cleaned before making the repair."
