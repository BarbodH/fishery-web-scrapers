If you need a pair of waders go check them out ,and if anyones had a pair for a while how have they been for durability and comfort during a full day of fishing."
458992,GBW,2010-04-23 14:40:00,8460,"Skeeter and I spoke about this deal yesterday and for some reason it wasn't listed on page 21 in his local flyer.  So check your store stock online.  Skeeter if you read this, use the Whitby store to browse the online flyer."
458995,SRT8 smoker craft,2010-04-23 14:48:00,1107,My store only showed 1 pair of 11's but there was 3 on the shelf I find most CTC stores that are chain owned (some are independant) don't have a clue what's in their inventory your best bet is to call or go into the store and check it out yourself.
459003,mepps,2010-04-23 15:32:00,1301,"They look pretty good, anyone have experience with these?"
459013,bassman87,2010-04-23 16:06:00,586,"is it the xplore waders? they are HORRIBLE, i had a pair leak on my 2nd trip at the seam where the boots are. i dont know if it was just a bad pair but i returned it and invested in some simms"
459050,skeeter,2010-04-23 18:10:00,1907,the paper flyer i got in the mail yesterday DID NOT have the waders or the rods listed in it. no there was not any pages missing in it. but the online flyer that finally came thru today has them listed in it.  does anyone own a pair of these? and how do you like them?
459052,bassman87,2010-04-23 18:13:00,586,yeah i just saw the flyer. its not the xplore ones. i cant comment on these
459056,GBW,2010-04-23 18:25:00,8460,"I would go buy a pair while on sale and try them on at home (as well as in store).  If you don't like them or you get a bunch of ""they are junk!"" type of replies."
459096,SRT8 smoker craft,2010-04-23 19:48:00,1107,I don't think they have carried these for very long I noticed them in the fall and I think they were a new product then I'm gonna put some hours on them in the next 2 weeks if they suck ya have 30 days to return them.
459103,bow slayer,2010-04-23 21:02:00,1074,"I just  picked up a pair of them here in St.Thomas made by woods. They also had the xplore ones and after comparing the 2 I felt the woods  were a much better product,the also came with a felt bottom boot as the xplore were boot foot only. Good deal for 100 bucks. The last pair of breathables i had (fenwicks) have lasted me nearly 10 years hopefully these will also."
459283,johnnyb,2010-04-24 14:48:00,3413,The flyer here also had (what I thought was) a decent combo -- Abu Reels and Fenwick rods for $39...not too shabby!
