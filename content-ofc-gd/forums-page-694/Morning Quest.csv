459180,GBW,2010-04-24 01:11:00,8460,"Hey Spiel, that fist pic is just great, amazing colours!  The second pic, not so much.  I see a lot of gray hair there... It's all good, mine looks just like yours..."
459183,Joey,2010-04-24 01:17:00,9122,Go get em Chris.  So happy to see you getting out hon!!  Joey
459192,Spiel,2010-04-24 01:31:00,9065,   LOL....I thought so to Dann and shaved it all off today after about 10 years of sporting it. Problem is under all that hair my face got fat.     Thanks Joey. I don't expect I'll be out long but I plan on enjoying it to the fullest!  
459194,irishfield,2010-04-24 01:35:00,26272,Have fun Bud !!!

459197,Spiel,2010-04-24 01:41:00,9065," Thank you much Wayne, I'll do my best fish or not!  Are you heading out for some opener action?   "
459200,GBW,2010-04-24 01:57:00,8460,"I'm Geoff, Dann is Skeeter   I haven't shaved mine off in over 10 years so I am not looking forward to the day I do."
459201,irishfield,2010-04-24 01:58:00,26272,"Yep... straight to the shop/hangar in the morning!   Hopefully if I keep at it I can make ""opener"" (3rd Sat in May) at the lake !"
459204,Spiel,2010-04-24 02:16:00,9065,"  Doh....my bad Geoff, might be, or is likely the beer. My apologies, not sure how that happened, so embarrassed.    Pay the bills first Wayne, then everything else will be copa.....GOOD."
459205,Daplumma,2010-04-24 02:24:00,1961,Is that morning quest anything like morning wood?Good luck with both old man! Joe
459207,Spiel,2010-04-24 02:30:00,9065," Well there be lots a wood where I need to get my lure into Joe. That's what you mean, right?   "

459221,GBW,2010-04-24 03:10:00,8460,"It's all good.  I hope you get at least one nice fish (ore more) tomorrow. PS, it's the beers as that what I blame all my spelling and replies  on..."
459224,danc,2010-04-24 03:22:00,4677,Enjoy your day Chris. Hope you catch a few while I'm at work.
459244,Roy,2010-04-24 07:41:00,13728,"Have a good one Chris. Take it easy and enjoy.  I'll be off in 30 minutes or so. Scouted out some lakes as you know, on the Easter weekend and so one is all picked out for today.  Good luck to all, enjoy and play safe."
459301,Spiel,2010-04-24 16:15:00,9065,Skunked !
459308,Tybo,2010-04-24 16:33:00,1373,Great to see that you're getting out and about. 
459330,solopaddler,2010-04-24 19:48:00,8605, Hey bud you got out and that's more than I can say.  Long overdue on your part methinks.
459479,Spiel,2010-04-25 10:27:00,9065,"  It wasn't all that much about as it was out.     As noted above, I was out. I'd venture I fished no more than 40 minutes and likely made less than 2 dozen casts. The creek was almost without water so I spent a little time bending me elbow while letting Brook play with the neighbours dog before calling a day. Not a terribly exciting report for opener."
459507,limeyangler,2010-04-25 13:21:00,5204,Too bad Chris....but enjoyed the thread all the same...lol.
