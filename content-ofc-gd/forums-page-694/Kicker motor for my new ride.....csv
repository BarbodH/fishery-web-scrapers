459586,TroutnMuskieHunter,2010-04-25 19:06:00,1362,"I'm now looking at the $$$$$$$$ task of rigging the new ride and have come across a deal for a new 2008 Tohatsu 8HP 4-stroke long shaft kicker...half the price of the Merc  9.9 Pro Kicker...  My question is whether the 8HP is big enough to troll my 20' Tracker Tundra on a windy day??  I'm estimating that the total weight of the boat, 150HP Merc, and 40 gallons of gas is ~ 2500lbs...  Thanks,  Steve"
459588,irishfield,2010-04-25 19:15:00,26272,Give thought to the prokicker being geared different and having the 4 blade prop Steve.  Don't see an issue with the 8HP pushing you though.. I used one as emergency power on the swim platform of a 26' Fiberform in the early 90's.  The 9.9 kicker on my 22 foot Lund works just fine. Many tried to convince me I needed a 15.. but definitely don't. I can get 5.7 MPH out of the kicker and it takes a FAIR amount of wind to make turning left difficult to the point I need to start the big motor to start the turn. Of course right hand turns are no issue.
459589,Tom McCutcheon,2010-04-25 19:20:00,627,"Steve; I don't expect that will get you up to some of the speeds for Muskie that you MAY wish. We run a 9.9 Merc. four stroke on an 18' Lund and we get upwards of 5.5 to 6 MPH. and right down to 1 MPH (it is not a bigfoot.) In heavy wind or waves you might be regretting your decision. I know they are a lot of money upfront, but it would be well spent.  IMO."
459590,Radnine,2010-04-25 19:23:00,1538,"I was talking to Charlie Wray at the boat show and he was showing me (and everyone else) his new boat. It was a 22'Crestliner with a 250 Merc and a 9.9 Prokicker. I couldn't get over how small and kind of underpowered it looked, but because of the gearing and the prop (like Wayne just said) it does a great job. Jim"
459595,TroutnMuskieHunter,2010-04-25 19:34:00,1362,"Thanks for the replies so far guys....what's the difference between the Merc 9.9 Bigfoot and the Pro Kicker??  Wayne,  Is your kicker attached to your main outboard or do you have an extended handle and steer it seperately?"
459599,Roy,2010-04-25 19:42:00,13728,I know that dollars are an issue but for that boat I'd go with a 15hp pro-kicker.
459600,irishfield,2010-04-25 19:42:00,26272,9.9 Prokicker has power tilt and 4 blade prop. The bigfoot has manual 5 position tilt and 3 blade prop. Same gear ratios.  There is now a 15 HP prokicker as well as Roy has pointed out.  Mine is remote steer.. ie it's hooked to the big motor with a rod. Electric start (also has pull cord)
