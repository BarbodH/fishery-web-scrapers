The shore of the sea didn´t melt down yet, but that wasn´t enough to stop me.    So I went on that 2 Celsius degrees water, and after 3 hours of pain I got 2 nice looking pikes, 75 and 83cm, not monsters, but much more that what I was expecting for that day in such a horrible conditions.      Also came on the hooks 3 bream males, one of them was my biggest in that specie until now.      And the big one.    Hope to offer you more and bigger nothern pikes soon."
458697,MCTFisher9120,2010-04-22 12:07:00,3761,What are those haha  Nice pike
458702,bigugli,2010-04-22 12:18:00,6138,"83cms is still a respectable pike, especially in Southern Ontario. Further north the target is for 100cm. A lot of people here still look at pike as garbage fish, but there is nothing better for making kalamojakka."
458705,Fang,2010-04-22 12:47:00,1330,"neat looking swim bait, does it have a name??"
458715,mepps,2010-04-22 13:29:00,1301,"Awesome stuff, cant wait until season opens here!  I'd love to target some Baltic pike one day too!"
458728,darsky,2010-04-22 14:23:00,586,  looks like a storm kick'n minnow
458744,fish-miester,2010-04-22 15:23:00,864,I was more interested to see the lure hanging out of the mouth of the pike.!
458763,Minnow,2010-04-22 16:02:00,177,"Nice pike and bream, can't wait to see some monster Baltic pike! Keep the reports coming!"
458786,jimmer,2010-04-22 17:47:00,2730,Always nice to see an International post here.  Very interesting to see different species of fish.
458788,TC1OZ,2010-04-22 17:51:00,987,"Your fish are awesome, and the women of your country are even better!  Keep the reports coming!"
458798,highdrifter,2010-04-22 18:38:00,2534,That water looks mighty turbid..  and cold..  You must know your craft!  Those bream remind me of our fresh water drum!  Thanks for sharing
458814,kickingfrog,2010-04-22 19:26:00,8333,Nice fish!  Can you fish for pike through the ice? Seven months is a long time.
458834,Paully,2010-04-22 21:06:00,712,do they always bite with their backs? lol
458912,Cypher,2010-04-23 03:24:00,20,Nice report. Looks like you had a great time out there.
458927,fish-miester,2010-04-23 05:31:00,864,"  haha they must body check the lure  Im jk, those are some nice fish"
459112,Guest Hauki,2010-04-23 21:45:00,0,"Hi guys, thanks for your comments!!!  About the breams and the weird way the are hooked, its something very common until june. Those males don´t like intruders messing around in their territory.  Hope to put more stuff soon."
459199,Paully,2010-04-24 01:56:00,712, I was jut pullin' your chain..  What else do you catch out there?
459541,Guest Hauki,2010-04-25 16:18:00,0,"   Most of the time I go for nothern pike, it´s my favorite. But also i spend some time after perch,brown trout, gryling, and burbot during the winter."
459621,fishinfool,2010-04-25 21:12:00,366,"Nice to have you aboard Hauki, keep the reports coming. I love to see the size of some of those finish fishies. Suksi vitoon!! (Is that the right spelling) lol"
