Am i wasting my time on stoney or is it a good idea to try this new area for me out. I usually fish Temagami but the drive is just a bit to far for the weekend. Any comments would be appreciated. Thank you. Im also new on hear and havent found my way around the site yet. I hope to have more details on my profile soon. "

It is known as Stoney for a reason though, so until you are familiar with it stay in the charted areas and go slow. Welcome to the board and good luck.  Tom."
459734,Stoltzeneggar,2010-04-26 01:33:00,10,"  thank you.  With the money my fishing pals and i spend renting cottages we could get a trailor and search out a new lake. Im excited and have heard good things about stoney, hopefully i get a few more responses to convince me that this lake could be my new hole."
459754,dakota,2010-04-26 02:04:00,7,I agree with Tom the lake is very rocky  it can go from 60 ft to 3 ft out in the middle   rocks are every where   i ve fished stoney for about 35 yrs now   my parents have a place up there    it can be a hard lake to fish.  good luck Rob
