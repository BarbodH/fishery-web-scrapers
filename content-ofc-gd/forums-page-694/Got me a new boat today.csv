459242,Cudz,2010-04-24 05:32:00,2652,"Not to hyjack this thread but are we talking bout a De Tomaso Pantera???  They came with 351 cu in engines.  No big blocks.  I may be wrong but when it comes to cars, not usually.  My buddy had one as well.  They are mid engine and I don't think they have enoyugh room to shoehorn in a bigblock.  As for the boat, congrats.  SUCK MY WAKE would be a good name for her."

459102,Roy,2010-04-23 20:50:00,13728,Useless if she can't idle down to 1.5 for walleye. Not my kind of boat but congrats.....looks like a real mover.
459106,JohnF,2010-04-23 21:10:00,3494," Even if he can idle her down, the noise will probably chase away any fish within a half mile.  Have you ever listened to a jet boat wind out on a flat lake? Friend of a friend used to have one with a big Ford in it up north. You could hear him fire it up miles away and then listen to every foot of the very quick trip up the lake. He used to let it out by the moonlight when the lake was really calm.  That was spooky. Not real smart but we were young then, and unbreakable.  JF  JF"
