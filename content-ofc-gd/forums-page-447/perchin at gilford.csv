659174,mudcat,2012-01-22 20:58:00,3,"Its been a couple of years since i got out to gilford. arrived at 7:30AM. Decided to leave the portable hut and electronics at home and go old school. Went straight out gilford rd. in around 15 ft. and did not move from the first 2 holes drilled. Lost count at how many perch iced but did end up keeping just over a dozen 10"" and up with 4 jumbos in the mix. Ill try to post a photo. hope it works. THE MUDCAT"
659248,Rizzo,2012-01-23 00:53:00,4754,when you don't have to drill any extra holes its a good day
659249,Skipper D,2012-01-23 00:54:00,1970,"Way to go there MC , we like pictures but don't see any ... lol"
659268,Joeytier,2012-01-23 01:33:00,3990,"That wind was brutal.  Lefroy was about the same, countless dinks with keepers few and far between and only a small handful of jumbos.  People are starting to venture out close to the main lake now, but I certainly wouldn't recommend it.  Cedar point had no more than 3 to 3.5 inches today."
659330,bigugli,2012-01-23 05:02:00,6138,"I was out on the opposite shore having a stellar day. Way too many dinks, but still managed a decent bag.  That wind was brutal.  Was glad to be in a hut."
659523,Acountdeleted,2012-01-23 17:49:00,2562,Out of curiosity how thick is the ice where you were? I keep hearing good things about Gilford and would love to check it out. But I keep hearing on the radio that the ice conditions are considered unsafe to be out on.
659526,Court R,2012-01-23 18:13:00,213,"I was in 6-7""of ice in 35' of water out of Gilford on Sunday."
659532,a.cortellessa,2012-01-23 18:51:00,142,Nice pic! Good to see that the conditions are good enough out there to be ice fishing. I have heard a lot of mixed info about the ice thickness. Is the entire bay frozen or just out of gilford?
659549,Court R,2012-01-23 19:41:00,213,"Looked like all the way, I was about halfway and could see guys out pass me."
659626,LefroyFisherman,2012-01-23 23:42:00,602,I was over on Keswick side on Saturday and we were on 6-7 inches of ice
659631,biggs,2012-01-23 23:51:00,21,  True that!
660003,fishingfarmer,2012-01-24 23:23:00,34,I was out Sat .It was a beautiful day.Lots of fish most in the 5 to7 in range.Lots of ice was a blast got enough bigger fish for a meal.
660672,Acountdeleted,2012-01-26 18:00:00,2562,"So this sunday I'm thinking of hitting up Cooks bay at Gilford, I asked a buddy of mine where to get bait and he said there are a few bait shops near the water but they might have shut down due to some Emerald Shiner issue he had heard of. I don't really know the area well, can anyone recommend a good bait shop for some perchin size minnows?"
660702,Court R,2012-01-26 18:50:00,213,"I wouldn't buy minnows for those perch, jiggin raps or buckshot's work great...if you want bait the Fish Ontario on the 400 has them."
660735,misfish,2012-01-26 20:12:00,29133,"  Micro tubes. White or pink.  Once you get some perch,you can slit the gullit into peices and put on a tear drop."
660964,Acountdeleted,2012-01-27 04:29:00,2562,"Thanks for all the advice guys, went to lebaron today to switch my reel. I accidently picked up a Shimano 1000 for my new St. Croix ice fishing rod which was way too big. When I exchanged it for a Rapala R-type they told me I had $15 left over so I picked up some buckshot, some white and pink micro tubes and a few spinner jigs. I'll let everyone know how sunday goes. I'm so stoaked to ice some jumbo perch."
660968,BillM,2012-01-27 05:10:00,17367,There will be lots and lots of dinks inbetween any decent fish.  Pretty much the way it's been out on Simcoe this year.  At least you'll have steady action!
660974,Freshtrax,2012-01-27 06:00:00,2215,I like to lay on the ice and play keepaway from the small ones.  Once you get the school in a frenzy you can jigg the school right up to under the hole... Half the fun of perch fishing for me im a big kid at heart.
661033,Acountdeleted,2012-01-27 13:18:00,2562,Even dinks I'm ok with. I'm just stoked to get out there and have some productive fishing action. For whatever reason I've never had tons of success through the ice. But a day of action with a few good eaters sounds like the perfect way to spend many a weekend over the winter.
