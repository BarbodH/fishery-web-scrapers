So this is what I have now, an hds7 insight and two walker tournament series pack riggers with auto stop.  My ? Can I control my riggers with this unit? Is there an adapter to acheive this? If its not possible then no problem.  Any suggestions or know how, would greatly be appreciated. Thanks  Vince"
660052,JTorra,2012-01-25 02:06:00,50,The Hummminbird/Cannonlink is the only system I am aware of that will do this.  http://www.cannondownriggers.com/Technology/CannonLink/

660056,asdve23rveavwa,2012-01-25 02:22:00,2690," Did you ask Jocelyn, yet, Vince.  I'm sure he'd know if it is possible."
660068,vinnimon,2012-01-25 02:46:00,2593,"NO,silly me  Too much on the go, and it just popped up in my mind tonight."
660076,BillM,2012-01-25 03:00:00,17367,I don't think they make one...  Cannonlink for the Humminbird is the only one I've ever heard of.
660077,strik,2012-01-25 03:02:00,175,The walker will not work with any  fishfinder  But the strik vision  might be nice  good luck
660085,vinnimon,2012-01-25 03:14:00,2593,"The only other way of doing this is to extend the three way toggles to the dashboard. One problem with is, is that this unit is gaurenteed for life. So tampering with it is not a good thing  "
660219,dwc67,2012-01-25 17:35:00,140,i would buy downspeed and temp first. in order of importance for me is my probe gps sonar  if you want to create action at your rigger zig zag or change your speed. i would rather have my rods loaded tight in the rigger so i know if i am dragging a shaker then having to leave slack so the rigger can cycle depths
660362,fishdawg,2012-01-25 23:41:00,912,agree with dwc67!  a Depth Raider or Subtroll cant be beat!  I see helm rigger controls as being a little gimmicky
