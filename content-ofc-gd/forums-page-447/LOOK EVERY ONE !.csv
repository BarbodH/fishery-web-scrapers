660518,lew,2012-01-26 10:20:00,12766, Not too many Brian but every now & then one wanders thru the yard. I posted this picture a couple weeks back but he's the only buck I've seen this year.    It was nice here last evening just at sunset when I looked out the back window and there were 2 does and a youngun only 50' from the house and then they hung around the yard for about 10 minutes. Would been nice to get a picture but I didn't want to spook them.  Neighbor down the road told my wife the other day that she watched a wolf take down and kill a deer on Clear Lake right in front of her place.
