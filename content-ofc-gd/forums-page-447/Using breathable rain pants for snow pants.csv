660959,kickingfrog,2012-01-27 04:13:00,8333,The snow pants I have are near the end of their usefulness. With this mild/short winter I'm reluctant to buy a new pair this season. Has anybody else used their high end rain pants/bibs for winter?
660961,Sinker,2012-01-27 04:22:00,8692,"I use them at work every day. It gets too hot in standard insulated bibs, so when I'm WORKING outside, the waterproof, breathable bibs are my choice.  I'm not sure I would use them for icefishing though. My skinny arse gets cold If I'm not dressed warm enough. I guess if you layered up underneath them properly, you'd be fine. They are a great shell/windbreak for sure.  S."

661078,bdox,2012-01-27 15:33:00,329,"My snowboard pants/jacket are the same 2L Gore-Tex as my Pro Qualifier suit. That being said, I would just be worried about trekking through the bush in my rain suit, in case you happen to snag a thorn or branch and cause a rip/tear."
661083,Garnet,2012-01-27 16:27:00,2056,"I wear wind pants. Not the ones with lining. Have wore my Cabala's  Guide Wear been plenty warm, just very expensive for steelheading and ice fishing."
661084,SylvanOwner,2012-01-27 16:36:00,266,"I wear a pair of breathable bibs for snowboarding, the same pair I wear in the summer when camping/canoeing if raining.  Like has been said just wear the appropiate layers underneath. Pair of jogging pants under the bibs when boarding, same pair of jogging pants under my survival suit when ice fishing."
661095,kickingfrog,2012-01-27 16:53:00,8333,Thanks guys. I guess my main concerns were are they breathable enough and recking them for the other 3 seasons. One of the guys working for the outfitter I used on the weekend was using a pair and I was looking for more input.
