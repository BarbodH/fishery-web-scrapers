660425,dave524,2012-01-26 02:23:00,4508,Have seen a lot of favourable comments on the Airmar P66 as a replacement when your original Lowrance transducer craps out  http://www.airmartechnology.com/2009/products/marine-product.asp?prodid=48&manf=Furuno
660435,bassassin,2012-01-26 02:43:00,152,I used to work there from 2000 - 2002 they are all good people there! its called Navico now but the same rules apply people... Just call them and they'll take good care of you!  Jason
660441,irishfield,2012-01-26 02:54:00,26272,"As I noted to revive this thread yesterday.. it's not called Navico anymore.. Lowrance is sending you to ""CMC Electronics"", although it appears to be one and the same.. maybe.. with Dino still the ""go to"" guy."
660475,bassassin,2012-01-26 03:46:00,152, I stand corrected!  Apparently they are on Laird now no longer on Matheson!
660585,SmokestackLightnin,2012-01-26 14:34:00,390, Likely that was Lawren Wetzell who is now employed by Radioworld.
660622,lew,2012-01-26 15:52:00,12766," You could very well be right, I didn't get his name but he treated me like I was the most important customer they had, fixed up my problem in a couple minutes and had me on my way again.  He'll do well wherever he works !!"
595585,Dutch,2011-06-23 01:40:00,831,"Wondering if anyone has a contact at Lowrance Canada they can provide me with via PM.  I have made 4 calls to the 1-800 nummber and have sent 6-8 e-mails with zero response so far.  The thing with the 1-800 number is they make you wait about 5 minutes then you have to leave a message to which no one apparently responds.  Fairly easy question - I have a finder that I know is pooched.  They no longer support it, but offer a replacement HDS unit for a price and all I want to know is what that price is.  Lowrance is very close to losing a previously satisfied customer....."
595587,mercman,2011-06-23 01:45:00,7054,"Got the same crap from them last year.Never did return my email, twice. I now have Humminbird on my boat, and when the Lowrance unit in the bow gives up, it`ll be a humminbird that goes there too"
595589,atvaholic,2011-06-23 01:48:00,271,"Instead of dialing the 800 number, maybe try locating the office and calling directly. Maybe the president can be contacted."
595590,irishfield,2011-06-23 01:49:00,26272,"I was under the impression, back in 2007 when trying to get network parts for my new units, that Lowrance Canada was totally shut down and there was nothing other than the repair facility left.  Terry has been there.... do you have contact info Terry??"
595596,Dutch,2011-06-23 02:06:00,831," I ""think"" they still have a location in Canada.  I know the number we call here in Canada is different than in the States.  At one point I had a contact I was dealing with about a separate issue - soon as they found out I was in Canada, they pawned me off.  Had great service up to that point."

595608,spinnerbaitking,2011-06-23 02:40:00,1622,"Last time I had a problem I went to their office just south of 401 & 410 in Mississauga, fixed me right up SBK"
595615,Stef,2011-06-23 02:56:00,63,"My X510C is fading in and out badly, possibly the LCD or a power issue.  Called Lowrance Canada, they answered right away, after discussion said they don't repair anymore but offered me the HDS 5 at $449, thats over $100 off of the best price I could find , as a replacement.  Didn't want the HDS, but it gives you an idea of what to expect..........."
596097,gaspumper,2011-06-24 03:06:00,393,"Here is a number for Lowrance out of Toronto 1-800-661-3983,Push#1 then #2"
596243,Raf,2011-06-24 14:19:00,3495,"Navico  919 Matheson Blvd E, Mississauga L4W 2R7, ON  p: 9056291614"
596268,Dutch,2011-06-24 15:08:00,831,"Thanks to everyone for providing info on numbers to call.  It seems they all lead to the same place - I end up on hold for about 7 minutes, then I am asked to leave a voice mail which is never returned.  I think I am done with Lowrance.  This system of leaving a voicemail is horrible.  I'd rather wait on hold for two hours and finally be able to talk to someone.  This has just been far too frustrating.  I'm wasting a day off to deal with this - rather be fishing.....  Anyone have a specific extension number of someone in Mississauga?"
596301,Raf,2011-06-24 16:36:00,3495,"i've never had an issue the rare time i had to deal with them but, living in the gta i'd just drive over to the office on matheson in mississausage.  never bothered with the phone."
596325,lew,2011-06-24 18:02:00,12766,"I've also had excellent service when I stopped into their office to get a unit updated but I was under the impression they've left the Matheson location for good.  I've got a couple sonar units that need updating and my daughter works just up the road from them, I'm wondering now if maybe she could get it done for me if their still there"
596348,Squid,2011-06-24 19:27:00,1656,Call Josh at angling outfitters.  (519) 539-5494
596399,Dutch,2011-06-24 22:47:00,831,"Finally had someone pick up the phone - almost scared the crap outta me!  Guy just answered the phone and said hello, for a second I thought I had the wrong number.  Very, very strange system they have.  The guy I talked to was named Dino.  I was scared to say I need to call back and proceed to calmly explain their system is horrible.  He gave me his direct extension, which is 226, so at least I can rest assured I can talk to a human at some point.  The price to upgrade my unit to a HDS5X (sonar only, no GPS) is $440.  They don't have an upgrade to a GPS enabled unit for a replacement for mine, so it's the HDS5X or nothing.  Just debating if I want to spend that for a sonar only.  It would be an easy swap as the transducer and power cable are the same.  Thanks again for the numbers golks."
596403,Handlebarz,2011-06-24 23:05:00,3790,Pete took my answer Jos will take care of you if he can not then he will send you to the right place he is the biggest dealer for them and his word is gold.
659709,irishfield,2012-01-24 04:49:00,26272,Interesting that Lowrance now tells you to contact CMC Electronics for Canadian service... especially since they're a Raymarine Dealer! 
659734,Billy Bob,2012-01-24 11:46:00,5865, Call them back and tell you your LMS 520c unit burned up and want a replacement....they should offer you a HDS unit with GPS...
659745,asdve23rveavwa,2012-01-24 12:49:00,2690,"  X 3....Jocelyn is ""the man"", when it comes to Lowrance."
659778,barrystrs,2012-01-24 14:39:00,75,When I called last summer they were very helpful and spent a lot of time on the phone with me.  I need a new transducer for an old LCX 15 if anyone has one to sell.
659781,lew,2012-01-24 14:55:00,12766,"I was in the Mississauga office a few years back and the fella that served me was actually a member of this board but I can't remember his name now. If he's still around it'd be good if he could chime in with some info on what's happening.  [quote name='barrystrs' date='24 January 2012 - 09:39 AM' timestamp='1327415967' post='659778'  I need a new transducer for an old LCX 15 if anyone has one to sell.   barrystrs, I've got a transducer from an X510C I'm not using and it's yours if it'll work on your LXC 15, although it's doubtful."
659783,irishfield,2012-01-24 15:02:00,26272,Sorry for the confusion... I should know better than popping up an 8 month old post. Just wanted to show that Lowrance is now showing a new repair facility represents them in Canada... that is a Raymarine Dealer. (although who knows these days... it may very well still be Navico under a new name)
659825,asdve23rveavwa,2012-01-24 16:03:00,2690," Oops, I never even checked the original dates on this one.  I blame it on lack of ice down here"
660061,superdad,2012-01-25 02:28:00,353,"When you talked to Dino, you were talking to the right guy, he's agood guy and should be able to fix you up.  I've taken my unit to their storefront and they fixed me up, anaylyzed my unit and told me the transducer was shot and they were right!!!!!  Just my .02  David  aka  Superdad"
660407,miller,2012-01-26 01:39:00,223,cmc is the supplier we go through them and deal with dino whenever we need units ordered or accessories basically anything lowrance. as far as i know they are they only navico dealers we can get products from up here.  and superdad yeah that seems to be a common issue. they tend to burn out ever 3-4 years or so and thats one of the most frequent issues i've heard of.
