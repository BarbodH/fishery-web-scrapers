658319,Spouph,2012-01-20 01:27:00,115,"mr buddy is good and you can flip the cage at the front to cook on it, how ever the damn thing is always shutting off.  I would go with the five pound tank the green coleman are too expensive, you can also go tho the plumbing isle at canadian tire and they have blue propane tanks, whick are Identical but are cheaper.  i\d give 6 out of ten for convience, but the sunflower which I own , constand heat down to a t shirt and you can also cook on it.  is by far suppior, there are some flaws though, the thin copper tube snapped off about my thirrd trip buddy threw his bag on it that was it.  It also near killed three of us, did not realise how close we were until a buddy tried to light his smoke and his lighter would not lite,  not enough oxygen to lite a flame.  I run with my buddy now it pisses me off but the other is broken and I know I won;t die.  sunflower is better in my opinion, just don't go to sleep."

658361,tilly,2012-01-20 03:28:00,32,Any tips for dealing with condensation with these propane heaters?  Noticed quite the buildup in my popup using a coleman stove...
658365,irishfield,2012-01-20 03:31:00,26272,"Open you highest tent vent at all times. Nothing else you can do.. propane is a ""wet"" heat and why you don't need a humidifier when heating a house with propane."
658369,DRIFTER_016,2012-01-20 03:42:00,10439, Depends where you live Irish. My house is pretty dry and I heat with propane. Every time I move in the winter and touch something grounded lightning bolts shoot out of my fingers!!!   PS condensation isn't an issue @ -40!!! It turns to ice before it ever gets a chance to drip on you!!!

658424,goteeboy,2012-01-20 12:40:00,175,"I bought a little buddy heater (Mr. Heater) but I found it a pain in the butt.  It's top heavy and thus tippy and seems to have a tough time lighting up when it's really cold.  What I've been trying this year is a cheap butane stove like this.  http://www.fcsurplus.ca/shopping/products/56-Camp-Cooking-Accessories/15269-World-Famous-Butane-Stoves/    They're only about 20-25 bucks.  And I found an even more compact one where the butane fuel canister stick out a bit.  Pros 1. cheap 2. sufficient heat 3. butane fuel is around $5-6 for a 4-pack at any Asian grocery like Galleria in the GTA or H-mart in Richmond Hill.  I heard there are poorly made fuel canisters (from China?) so I try to get mine at Korean groceries.  Quality is supposedly higher.  As an FYI, last time I checked crappy tire, they had the butane but it was really overpriced. 4. Can also cook on it which i do all the time, boil water for tea/coffee, etc. 5. very light and compact. comes with case 6. Self starting, twist of a dial. 7. can use as camp stove in summer 8. fuel canisters are also very compact and store easily (shaped like a can of hairspray but more girth)  Cons 1. Open flame in tent (but we keep ours right in the middle so it's pretty safe) 2. Butane canisters lose their pressure when it gets really cold so the flame size shrinks (my solution is that I keep a couple canisters close to my chest, under my jacket and rotate them when the flame shrinks. 3. I suppose if wind leaks into your tent the flame can go out 4. not 'green' as you will need to dispose of your empty canisters."
658462,Fisherman,2012-01-20 15:25:00,7201,The only way you would get any condensation in the house from propane/ng is if you have a bad heat exchanger.  If that was the case you would die from CO poisoning in short order.
658464,asdve23rveavwa,2012-01-20 15:30:00,2690,"Looks like TSC has all their portable heaters on sale for 30 % off this week. I use a Coleman (think it's a Pro Cat) in our Clam 2000.  Picked it up for $30 at Liquidation World two years ago.  Does the job, adequately, in my hut...might be a little weak in a pop-up with no floor."
658484,DRIFTER_016,2012-01-20 16:40:00,10439, Exactly. That's why my permie will probably have a small vented propane furnace in it. I have one I'm not using availble to use in it.
658718,Dabluz,2012-01-21 06:30:00,701,"I use a 2500 to 5000 BTU Coleman catalytic propane heater.  I can put 2 one pound canisters inside it and switch canisters when one is empty.  At 5000 BTU, a one pound canister only lasts about 3 hours.  At 5000 BTU, the pop up is barely warm on a cold day.  I still have to keep my coat on (unzipped) but the eyes on my rod do not freeze up.  A 10,000 BTU heater would be better but a one pound canister would only last about 1 1/2 hours."

659662,Bluegill,2012-01-24 01:34:00,197, One tip: Mostly the cans are lined with BPA. Don't use the can for heating your meal. Better fill it in a pot to heat!  More Info about BPA (Bisphenol A)

658132,troutologist,2012-01-19 16:57:00,951,"I am set on the single sunflower type. I have similar sizes shacks and use the 20lb tank in a milk crate. You can push the crate against the wall and bow it in a bit.  I had a colman black cat, it didn't do anything below -20. I really the only reason I have a shack is for really cold days so I want something that will keep it quite warm.  The single burner with a 20lb usually lasts me most of a season, its run on low mostly.  On a side note, I lean my metal scoop up again the the heater to warm soup or sandwiches. I know Irishfield has a neat setup for cooking with his."

I use a coleman lantern with the little green tanks, heats up a hut with no issue, plus gives off light, can use it camping in the summer etc.... green tanks last about 10 hours of non stop use, runs on high for about 5 minutes at first then as low as she will go."
658217,DRIFTER_016,2012-01-19 21:34:00,10439,  That's what I do too. I'm currently waiting for my local Superior guys to get me pricing on an 11# tank. My 5 pounder lasts 2 to 3 outings usually.    My home heating is propane so during the summer I'm going to look at adding a connection so I can fill my own bottles rather than having to go and have them filled. Seems the only time I run out is on a weekend when Superior is closed and the other local guys buy their propane from Superior and jack up the price before reselling it. My 5# is around $5 to fill at Superior and $16 at the other guys.

I bet they have a hard time getting water to boil for Mr. Noodles on the buddy.  Also guys.. be careful with these ""open flame"" ideas. They all equal carbon monoxide at a higher level than using a catalytic sunflower style burner."

The other makes only have ""off, low, medium and high"" settings. Trust me, there is no difference in the 3 settings. At least with a variable valve, you set the btu output to match the day."

They are reconditioned ones, they just put a new valve in them.  Much cheaper then a new tank.   I'm sure any propane place that sells propane and tanks should have them.  My 10lb tank is tall and hard to tip over, the bottom ring is as wide as the tank.  The tank is 30 years old though, new valve and some fresh paint and it looks like new.

658306,DRIFTER_016,2012-01-20 01:10:00,10439, They do not have a low oxygen shut off. I leave the door of my shelter open most of the time. I bought one off ebay and my latestI got at CTC. The CTC one needed some work so I could cook on it though (it's not a Mr Heater brand). It had a tilt sensor which I bypassed and removed as well as a support bracket that needed to be shifted and reworked. The Mr Heater one I had was much easier to adapt to cooking on as it had none of the safety features that the new one has.
