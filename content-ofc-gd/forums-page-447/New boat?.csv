659603,Grimace,2012-01-23 22:36:00,2020,"Maximum horsepower rating for that hull is 150.  Selling it to someone with a 50 on it is disingenuous.  They should not even offer it with less than a 90.  I feel sorry for first time boat buyers who may not know much about boats and are taking bad advice from sales people to get into these mismatches.   That 50hp package is only 33% of the rated HP for that hull, 50hp is only 66% of the rated HP for the Xtreme 16.  I strongly doubt that 50hp could even plane out that 18 foot hull.   Maybe a couple of sandbags up front.  Once you get the upgrade package with a suitable sized engine then you are at the same price point as the competition.  I have heard good things about Legend hulls (Smokercraft make them don't they?), but I find the marketing tactics to be unsavoury."
659604,Steve,2012-01-23 22:38:00,2075,"wow - Grimace, typed at the exact same time...  I'm quite confident 99% of FISHERMAN have the same feeling....but legend boats aren't marketed for fisherman....just first timers who don't know any better....  taking advantage of the ""uninformed""!"
659605,Grimace,2012-01-23 22:39:00,2020,"Steve, we think alike but you are a faster typist."
659610,irishfield,2012-01-23 22:51:00,26272,"Glad we're sellin Nadens with no motors...  Sorry Henry.. but gotta agree with them. A boat that won't get up ""on the step"", and instead is stuck at hull speed when loaded, is just a disaster waiting to happen."
659617,danbouck,2012-01-23 23:08:00,4380,That boat will go 30MPH with a 50. I am fine with a 50 on mine.  BTW I am a fisherman and I do know better
659620,Grimace,2012-01-23 23:22:00,2020,"Is your boat an 18 Dan?   I do not see a 50hp pushing an 18 foot boat 30mph.  Maybe a 16 footer.   If you say it does it, it must do it.  You must travel light.  How long does it take to get on plane?  I am not doubting you by the way, just curious."
659621,danbouck,2012-01-23 23:30:00,4380," Mine is 16.5, that is 17.5. With just me it's on plane instantly. With a couple other guys it takes maybe 5 seconds   Never timed it. I do have smart tabs as well  My weight makes the 1' weight difference unfortunatly"
659622,Steve,2012-01-23 23:34:00,2075,"my 17' boat weighs 676 lbs.  it's a tiller.  i have a 50hp 4 stroke.  i can get MAX 30mph....  with a standard load, I can get 27-28mph.  that hull weighs 1,175lbs.  you do the math."
659624,Grimace,2012-01-23 23:38:00,2020,"Your package is at 66% of the power rating which isn't that bad.  The Xtreme 18 is only a foot longer like you say but it is a much bigger boat.  The hull is 4 inches deeper, the beam is 8 inches wider, the hull is 200 pounds heavier and the capacity is 350 pounds heavier.  The HP rating is double.  I stand by my original assessment of the 50hp engine on that 18 Xtreme.  Percentage wise, that package is comparable to your boat with a 25 on it, which is currently half the size as what you have."
659627,Pigeontroller,2012-01-23 23:43:00,2793,If your 16.5 with a 50 hp gets you on plane instantly...My 16.5 must be like the Millenium Falcon going into light speed...    
659629,danbouck,2012-01-23 23:47:00,4380,"Couldn't tell ya, I was only on the Millenium Falcon once but we never went into light speed"
659765,ohhenrygsr,2012-01-24 13:58:00,947,"LOL too funny. We do not run an online shopping cart that a customer can simply go on click on the boat and wait for it to be delivered to their front door step. We believe in talking to everyone about a boat purchase and recommend the right horsepower for their needs. What kind of lake are you on?, How many people will be in the boat?, What is the purpose of the boat?... The list goes on and on. The salesperson builds a relationship with the customer and makes sure they have the right horsepower for their needs. These are just some of the things our dealers touch base on when talking to the customer. We do have customers that live on small lakes and the boat never leaves. So why should we try to push them to huge horsepower when they can't even go wide open.  YEP... That boat there is rated for 200HP you need 150HP on the back. Doesn't matter what your doing with the boat sir.  The marine world is filled with sales consultants that want you to have a great experience on the water. We build relationships with customers and help them choose the right boat and outboard based on there needs.  Example pricing from a competitor:  Priced with a 25Hp rated for 50HP. No idea how much more it is to get to the 85% of the recommended HP or does the customer need to max it out?   What is the difference between this and ours? Will the dealer talk about all the points I mentioned earlier you betcha!"
659767,ohhenrygsr,2012-01-24 14:02:00,947, LOL
659772,Grimace,2012-01-24 14:12:00,2020,So what is the right situation for a family to buy an 18 foot deep v hull powered with a 50hp engine?  Just wondering.
660059,Radnine,2012-01-25 02:27:00,1538," The only dangerous thing is the fact that the internet makes everyone an expert (except of course the guys that own Legends and the guy that works for Legend, they appparently don't know anything). Henry and Dan are welded together in their opinions, and the rest of you are riveted to one idea: everything but Lund is bad (throw Alumacraft in there as well, they are two peas in a pod as are the people that will know no other). I hope that the general boat buying public appreciates the service you guys are providing them by protecting them from the boat company who's only mission is to fill the lakes with boats that are struggling to get on plane. You guys need to find a more public vehicle for your message because it is clearly not being heard, the bloody lakes are filled with people in Legends. If only they knew the danger that they were in. Jim"
660065,BillM,2012-01-25 02:36:00,17367,"I don't think Henry is the one putting the packages together.  Of course it's put together that way to make it more pleasing to the eye, every industry is guilty of this type of marketing.  I don't think Henry would ever let a customer out the door knowing that the boat he sold them, knowing it's intended use was critically underpowered."
660095,Pigeontroller,2012-01-25 03:50:00,2793," Jim, you need to lighten up...All that tension is bad for your health."
660102,John Bacon,2012-01-25 04:22:00,3277, Nobody said Legend boats were dangerous; they said that a extremely underpowered boat (i.e. 1/3 of max hp) was dangerous. The only relation Legend is that they seem to be the most likely boat to be that underpowered.
660485,ohhenrygsr,2012-01-26 03:52:00,947,"I'm here to help people get on the water safely and to create memories. I love my job and very passionate about fishing, boating, meeting new customers and forums such as this one.  We are not the only company that will do a base outboard and show upgrades, it's marketing. It's up to the salesperson to do their job and get the customer into the right boat for their needs. I dont know any other way to put it. If I didn't work for a marine company, I would be doing my research and look for a boat that will suit my needs and choose the appropriate horsepower for the lakes I fish on. We don't bash our competitors, they all make great boats or else they wouldn't be in this industry. Thanks to every one for reading the post. It's great information for trevy727 to decide what feature and benefit he is looking for in a boat. Rather it's Legend or a competitor i'm sure the salesperson will do his job in getting him the correct horsepower for the waters he's fishing on."
658626,trevy727,2012-01-21 02:11:00,351,"I was at the boat show today and I'm really considering a Legend 18 Xtreme. In fact, I'm taking my wife back to the show Sunday morning to put a down payment and sign the papers unless I get a bunch of negative feedback from you guys/ gals. I've never been in a legend until today but they seem real nice and very well priced compared to some others. I've always had my heart set on a Lund, but after seeing the difference in prices, I don't think you get the money's worth. Any and all comments from everyone will be very much appreciated. I know that there's a ton of knowledge here and I respect everyone's opinion on my upcoming purchase. Thanks"
658627,BillM,2012-01-21 02:16:00,17367,"Did you upgrade the motor package?  That's one thing I noticed when we started to look for a new boat.  Lots of features, great price, but extremely underpowered in the standard package.  We ended up with a used Lund, couldn't be happier."
658631,irishfield,2012-01-21 02:19:00,26272,"What ever ""floats your boat"" is all that matters! And what Bill said.. watch the ""package"" details to make a sale, and how underpowered they usually are! (Sorry Henry!)"
658633,danbouck,2012-01-21 02:23:00,4380,You'll love it. Going on 4 years with mine
658636,trevy727,2012-01-21 02:26:00,351,"Yeah, I'm upgrading to a 115 4 stroke."
658648,Pigeontroller,2012-01-21 03:00:00,2793,"Whats the old saying, ""you get what you pay for...""  Price an equililent Alumacraft with a Yamaha"""
658654,DRIFTER_016,2012-01-21 03:17:00,10439,Bought mine at the show in 1991 and it's still going strong!! Yes I did get a motor upgrade at the time too. I have plans to repower her next year with new 4 stroke power.
658744,gordy28,2012-01-21 13:18:00,638,"My thoughts are the same as everyone else Know a few legend owners-all like the boat but most wish they had upgraded the engine. I actually think the ads they do in Ontario out of Doors, shows and other places are borderline false advertising: 16 and a half foot fully rigged boats with. 25 horse for under $10000 is not a great deal IMO"
658746,Terry,2012-01-21 13:25:00,14456,"legend boats are good boats the guys that I know that have them are very happy  they all upgraded the motor and that is the only problem I have, they so under power the boats to have a great low price that you get 3 big guys i the boat and try going into the waves and you can't get up on plane...very dangerous when you need control and power to survive ..... but once you know you need to more then double the HP, you have a great package"
658824,trevy727,2012-01-21 19:39:00,351,"Ok, after some research and reviews I've decided to hold off on my purchase. I will be buying a 18-19' aluminum boat this year just not this weekend. I really want brand new but I've been on the Internet and have seen a few new 2010 models with drastically reduced prices so I think I'll go that direction. Thanks for all the opinions and replies, I really appreciate it. I'll show it off when I finally make my purchase."
658921,silveradosheriff,2012-01-22 00:15:00,1025,I'm with Dax!
658937,Pigeontroller,2012-01-22 00:44:00,2793,"  Rod means he agrees with me, not that we're 'together', not that there's anything wrong with that!  Its January, don't rush, check out some models/prices at the Spring Fishing and Boat Show Feb 17-20"
658939,Pigeontroller,2012-01-22 00:45:00,2793,"And go see Doug and Clarence at Bay City Marine in Hamilton, I think you'll be impressed at the Alumacraft prices...Its definately an better built boat than a Legend."
658941,silveradosheriff,2012-01-22 00:50:00,1025,If you're not in a rush....I'm betting that some of the boys would take you for a water test in the spring so that you can try out a few of the different rides.
658945,DRIFTER_016,2012-01-22 00:57:00,10439,Just remember you will get a better price in the winter. Expect to pay at least $2000 more come the spring on a 17' boat package. I saved a couple of grand when I bought my camper 2 years ago by buying it in February rather than waiting for spring.
658953,BillM,2012-01-22 01:08:00,17367,"Fall is also a great time to buy a boat, people always trying to get rid of their toys"
658986,DRIFTER_016,2012-01-22 02:18:00,10439,  I'm looking for a 12' tinny right now to drop into a back lake up here. Problem is there are very few available so I have my buddies in Alaksa looking for me so I can pick one up in the fall. Got a line on a 14' jon/trailer that needs a new transom for $100. I can probably unload the trailer for $50 and carry the boat on my roof rack and have a $50 boat to leave in the bush.
659144,skeeter,2012-01-22 18:49:00,1907,"Take your time and think things thru. If it has what you want and is a great price, then research it a bit more.  I got a great deal on a boat last summer and I wasn't even looking for a new boat."
659167,mercman,2012-01-22 19:34:00,7054,"January and Febrary are good times to buy a new boat. I bought mine last Feb. A new 2010, and save almost 6K. Plus all the incentives from Princecraft and Mercury.Plus i squeezed the dealer hard, and got some freebies thrown in."
659196,captpierre,2012-01-22 22:44:00,2521,Will likely want a 130 hp or better 150h hp 4 stroke with a 18-19 ft IMO
659200,DRIFTER_016,2012-01-22 22:56:00,10439, Got a 90 on my 18 footer and it cruises at 25-27mph and tops out at 35-36mph. It's rated for max 115 hp.  Make sure you look at the max hp rating of the hull and get an OB within 20% of max and you will be fine.
659403,Lunkerhunter,2012-01-23 14:14:00,455,did you check out the princecraft boats? they had some great deals going on with lots of freebies. make sure to check them out as well.
659588,ohhenrygsr,2012-01-23 21:31:00,947,Loving the comments. Every manufacture is out to make a great boat and I happen to work for one of them. if you guys have notice we are 1 of few companies that list pricing on our boats. Yes we use smaller HP as a price point but it gives the customer the ability to choose the appropriate horse power for their needs. Most dealers that sell the manufactures product buy them pre-rigged and try to sell you the package with a massive horse power. Our pricing is upfront and shows you how much more it is to choose more power.     I will be using the 18 Xtreme with a 115HP 4-Stroke this year for my Tournaments. I cruise around 46-47MPH on my GPS with a standard aluminum prop. Anyone is more than welcome to come for a ride with me this year .  As long as its in Barrie or Orillia LOL.
659595,craigdritchie,2012-01-23 22:16:00,1586,"Best time to buy a boat is right now. The majority of manufacturers have some sort of deals or incentives between January and the end of March, coincident with all the boat shows and sports shows across Canada. These can take the form of rebates, discounts, special packages, extended warranties - or all of the above.  You can get good deals in the fall too, though that's normally a dealer giving a discount on leftover inventory they need to pay for and don't want to carry through the winter.  Perfect world - find a dealer who still has a 2010 model in stock now, and really wants to get rid of it. Then take the extended warranty on you new (i.e. still unregistered) engine. Best of both worlds.  Don't leave it too late. Every year guys see the boat they want at some show, then go back to buy it in June and find it's gone and the dealer isn't ordering in any more till the following winter."
659601,Steve,2012-01-23 22:35:00,2075,"Henry, I'm sorry, but what you are offering is DANGEROUS.  A first time boat owner may not understand how UNDERPOWERED a 50hp motor on your listed boat would be.  If it's rated for a 150hp, and your ""salesman"" can conciously offer a 50hp motor on it - well, it says a lot about the company.  I'm quite confident any respectable dealer would never ever sell a boat with a motor that is only rated at 33% of the max hp.  Yes, your correct, a buyer can upgrade. BUT will your salesman explain that it is unsafe to purchase that boat with the ""included"" motor of 50hp?!  Purely dangerous.  In my mind equal to a car dealership selling a Yukon truck with breaks for a civic. You can tell them, ""just don't break too hard"" ... just as likely you'll tell me ""it's better than staying on shore"" ... but really, is it?  The LEAST you should ever rig a boat rated for a 150hp is a 90hp engine. So your ""included"" price should be with a 90hp, MINIMUM!"
