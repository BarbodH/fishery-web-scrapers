I've been spending a fair amount of time on Lake Couchiching and even snuck out for some laker fishing before the wind and the rain. Perch fishing has been steady, and I have been eating well! I've been catching lots but I've really had to move a lot to keep on top of them.  The deeper water on Cooch has not been productive for me, but staying mobile in the shallow 7-10 foot range has produced well for us.  I havent touched live bait this year and the perch have come on small spoons (W-10 - W-20), Forage Minnows and Jigging Raps. The lakers were caught on a mix of spoons and X-Zone Swammers. At the bottom, I have attached my second episode of Keepin' It Reel.  It is a collection of ice fishing clips from last season and early this season.  Episode 3 will be all new footage. Enjoy!             http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=269PuVev9e8"
660139,johnnyb,2012-01-25 13:39:00,3413,Very nicely done!  You're killin' me with those lakers.  Do you ever go for pike on Cooch through the ice?
660140,Skipper D,2012-01-25 13:41:00,1970,"Wow thats awsome , great report , looks like a few of those big perch are just about ready to be walleyes .. lol . Thank you for sharing ."
660142,steverowbotham,2012-01-25 13:43:00,1800," I've never targetted them there, but I broke off 3 this year so far (2 lbs test).  Funny story, last week I lost my 2nd rod down the hole when a pike I broke off at the hole tangled in the other line.  An hour later my rod started dragging by underneath me and I was lucky enough to hook my rod, fight the pike attached to that rod for 10 seconds or so before it broke the line.  So I lost 2 lures in total, but I got my rod back!!"
660146,johnnyb,2012-01-25 13:50:00,3413,Crazy!  With that clear water I guess you have a better chance at getting rods back like that!

660467,Homer Is King,2012-01-26 03:34:00,305,"Great stuff! Congrats on the success! Some beauty fish! I gotta try a laker trip!  Do I see a couple punkinseeds in the perch pile? I've yet to catch one through the ice, what did they hit? I'd love to hook into a couple so I can scratch them off my ""Species to Catch through the ice"" list."
660487,ohhenrygsr,2012-01-26 03:53:00,947,Nice catch Steve
