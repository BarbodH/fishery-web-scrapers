659386,Billy Bob,2012-01-23 13:56:00,5865," My guess is that you did NOT take BillM advice as he said ""Bob, you'd wait it out for a lousy $500 and possibly miss out on the boat? Being cheap is good under the right circumstances, but this isn't one of them""  You did the smart thing....made a offer in the MIDDLE OF WINTER that he couldn't refuse....huh, who would of thought of that.....  Have fun in Cuba.......too bad you can't take the new rig with you....   Bob"
659394,bigbuck,2012-01-23 14:03:00,2449,"Well, no more agonizing over which boat. Now to start thinking about the top and whatever else you want to do to it while you are basking in the Cuban sun. Congrats, enjoy the boat."
659400,johnnyb,2012-01-23 14:12:00,3413,Awesome boat!!! Congrats
659419,BillM,2012-01-23 14:36:00,17367," Um, he took my advice..  He bought the boat not less then a week after you said he should wait until the middle of winter.  It's ok to be wrong once in a while, take it like a man instead of a 3rd grader."
659423,Billy Bob,2012-01-23 14:41:00,5865,"Billy Boy....you thicker then I thought....it IS the middle of winter....DAH....that was my point....it's the middle of winter, make a offer...DON'T pay asking price....go back and have someone read it to you real SLOW this time..."
659431,BillM,2012-01-23 14:45:00,17367,"Mike (Less then a week ago) : I want to buy a boat BB: Wait until the MIDDLE OF WINTER Me: Don't wait, it will be sold Mike: (Less then a week later):  I bought a boat.  Me: BB:  There's the play by play!  LOL!!"
659443,Billy Bob,2012-01-23 15:12:00,5865," Billy Boy, you're relentless and I like that....But you should of been a news reporter as they also like to take words out of context like you just did here...problem is....all my words are still on the other thread for viewing.....but to save you the trouble of ANOTHER honest mistake, I'll post them here so someone can again read them to you nice and slowly for your complete comprehension....  ""Wait a NY minute here.....you don't want to rush into anything here....it's mid winter""  I rest with that.....at least until next time you ""try"" to dog me""....LOL...  Bob"
659464,BillM,2012-01-23 15:38:00,17367,Did Mike buy a Grumman?   I think I win by default!  LOL   
659467,Billy Bob,2012-01-23 15:41:00,5865, OK Billy.......I always KNEW that....   YOU'RE A WINNER    :rofl2:  :rofl2:

659575,Aaron Shirley,2012-01-23 20:41:00,655,Good stuff Mike. That will be nice to take the kids out in as well as the bigger lakes  Have fun on the beach!
659640,Rizzo,2012-01-24 00:38:00,4754," congrats on the new boat but from this side of the keyboard didn't sound like an easy decision. I think at one point it was being called an agonizing decision. Either way, it sure feels good once you've made the plunge, hope you enjoy it for many years!"
659713,HTHM,2012-01-24 05:02:00,4082,  YOU'RE A WINNER   Finally Billy Bob got got
659744,Fish4Eyes,2012-01-24 12:48:00,1022,"Congrats on the new rig Mike, looks good. Not suprised at all you got a good deal, given the time of year. Best time to buy IMO."
659787,lew,2012-01-24 15:05:00,12766,"Well done Mike, that's a great looking boat and on the cold rainy miserable days you'll be very happy you went with the full windshield and canopy...and your family will thank you too !!"
659792,Harrison,2012-01-24 15:09:00,2202,Great choice Mike. Wait a sec.... you just bought a wicked boat and right now your on a beach soaking up the rays in Cuba. I would of bought the Lund.   PS.  Let me know the dimensions for the decal!
659849,Sinker,2012-01-24 17:08:00,8692,"Nice boat for sure, but is 75 ponies going to b enough? Whats it rated for? Seems a little under powered, but I could be wrong. My buddy has one with a 90 on it, and with 3 guys and gear, she's a bit slow getting up on plane. Nice boat to fish out of, but its no tiller  S."
659928,Joey,2012-01-24 20:57:00,9122,"Nice boat Mike, congrats"
660031,solopaddler,2012-01-25 00:47:00,8605,Just checking in from Cuba. You guys are hilarious LOL!  We're have a fabulous time. Full day of fishing planned tomorrow...can't believe it's already Tuesday night.  
660053,vinnimon,2012-01-25 02:08:00,2593,"In your second pic I noticed a yellow tethered rope on the steering wheel, I hope thats not the e brake anchor attached to the other end of it  JK, Nice rig Mike"
660066,Handlebarz,2012-01-25 02:39:00,3790,That looks awesome I am sure it will be put to great use this season congrats
658811,solopaddler,2012-01-21 18:55:00,8605,After mulling over a couple of different options and searching high and low for the best possible price we settled on a 2010 Smokercraft Ultima 162 with a 75 4 stroke Merc.  Ultimately it was the layout and extra width of this boat that made the decision easy.  That and the price. You guys wouldn't believe it if I told you what we got it for.  A couple of pic's:           Need to buy a top for it but that's no big deal.   Now it's off to Cuba for a week!
658812,asdve23rveavwa,2012-01-21 18:57:00,2690,"Nice rig, Mike!!!"

658828,icefisherman,2012-01-21 20:05:00,952,"Good looking boat Mike! Should I be looking for you while trolling Lake O. in the spring, instead of along the river banks?  Cheers, Ice Fisherman"
658830,solopaddler,2012-01-21 20:11:00,8605,"Thanks lads, I'll see y'all in a week."

658877,irishfield,2012-01-21 22:28:00,26272,Get Bill to help you keep that white bottom clean!!!!  Congrats Mike... great step and beauty boat!!!  Now go buy a 45 degree bent bottom kitchen mop now.. with the pull handle to ring. Scrub it right at the launch when you pull it out and it's still wet!
658914,TennesseeGuy,2012-01-21 23:49:00,957,That's a huge leap from the paddle.  What's your new name?  No more Solopaddler.
658916,BillM,2012-01-22 00:06:00,17367,"Wayne, the only thing I'm doing with that boat is help Mike load it with fish"
658922,esoxansteel,2012-01-22 00:20:00,1307,"That is a very nice looking rig Mike, now go soak up some sun  "
