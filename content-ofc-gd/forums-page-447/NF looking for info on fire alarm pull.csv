660396,skinny,2012-01-26 01:19:00,442,Hey there I need to run a fire systems check at work . I was shown once very very quickly be for the other guy suddenly retired . Now he is gone and it is my job to run the test  I have to pull a station and reset it I have included a picture of the station I cannot fid a name on it and I need to be able to reset it  I know he used a screwdriver. I think he just flipped something inside then closed the door . any help would be great    
660397,pikeguy,2012-01-26 01:22:00,195,should be a flat head screw on top or on the side  turn it and the front will open then its just a switch
660403,skinny,2012-01-26 01:31:00,442,no screws on outside I'm sure of it  I know the guy actually pulled the alarm
660406,drwxr,2012-01-26 01:39:00,453,"there is a small hole on the top or side where you push in the small screwdriver and by pressing the spring mechanism close the latch.     similar to 3:55 mark,  only this one has the small hole in the front.     most of the time there are instructions on the inside.

660812,skinny,2012-01-26 22:41:00,442,I looked real close at it today at work and there is no holes it it at all
660829,Terry,2012-01-26 23:10:00,14456,"if there is no screw on top or hole on side or bottom, I see no glass rod so it could be one that you just pull and then push back in to rest..."
