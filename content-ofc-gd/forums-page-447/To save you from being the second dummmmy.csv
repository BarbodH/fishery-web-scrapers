659684,irishfield,2012-01-24 02:42:00,26272,"Made arrangements to meet up with Lloyd on Sunday over Coboconk way. He heard me coming off in the distance and was nice enough to get some holes drilled for me to use.    Unfortunately my, ever trustworthy, Lowrance 102C decided to let me down and wouldn't power up. Not an issue, Lloyd had just bought a 67 off someone (to have as a spare) and let me use it for the day.    Lots of fish marked.. and chasing our baits, but they won and we went home skunked but a great day out on the ice. (I'd better correct that.. I got skunked.. Lloyd got an OOSSMB)  On the way home I had to wonder who was winning the last round of hockey on Sparrow Lake, raising money for Princess Margaret's Sarcoma unit.    Once I'd settled down from the ""interesting"" landing, in 40 gusting 55 here in the yard, and then finding oil pouring out of my engine compartment, which took 1/2 a gallon of varisol to clean off the belly of the plane....  I decided that I didn't have much to lose, with the 102C not working, and tore it apart.    Found some light corrosion on a few circuit board joints that appeared to be bridging a few spots on the board. Cleaned the board all up with some alcohol and Q tips, scubbing all the joints clean.    NOW... if you're gonna do something like this, stop now and put it back together!!! If I had of I'd have a nice working unit again.. but NO.. NO.. not Wayne, I had to see what everything else was about and got stupid and tore apart the ""tin can"".    Unfortunately when I did this the double sided tape in there pulled and stretched the gell cell somewhat. I cleaned it up and put it back together and ended up with this... damaged pixel cells.    If I hadn't pulled this apart she'd be just like new again... but now I've buggered the lower corner of the screen so I can't see the real time bar on the right side. I can still use it on split screen and use the zoom side, but not gonna be nice.  So with a big trip in the works in three weeks, I jumped on ebay and found another 102C for $200.. hope it gets here QUICK.  I've also found a supplier for the PD050OX1(LF) screen in China.. but I have to buy two of them.. $104 in my hands, once they get back from Chineese New Year!   ... or does anyone know a local source  (digi-key, newark, mouser are negatives)"
659721,limeyangler,2012-01-24 07:27:00,5204,Oh Wayne...never mind...fortune favours the brave...and you are way braver than me.
659724,Terry,2012-01-24 10:09:00,14456,man that sucks  yank the next one off the boat to use
659747,asdve23rveavwa,2012-01-24 12:55:00,2690,"First off, nice to see you and ""the captain"" getting out on the ice.  Leave it to him to be prepared with a second unit. Guess, on the bright side, better you had the issues now then on your big outing in a few weeks.  Definitely brave tearing her apart like that."
659755,Joey,2012-01-24 13:18:00,9122,You could just fish old school Wayne.  I seem to remember someone catching more fish than anyone else up there fishing old school
659758,John,2012-01-24 13:21:00,2956,Did something similar a few years back Wayne............at least you man'd up and hopefully stopped some other curious tinkerer from making the same mistake...
659759,asdve23rveavwa,2012-01-24 13:23:00,2690," Funny, but, I noticed up at Nipissing last week, I caught as many fish while just leaning back and not looking at the Lowrance as I did while using it.  That said, I would never go on the ice (other than 4-6 feet of water at LPB) without it!"
659785,irishfield,2012-01-24 15:04:00,26272,  The 112C might be hard on batteries!
659848,mercman,2012-01-24 17:07:00,7054,"Boys will be Boys, eh Wayne? I love taking things apart too. I always have extra parts when i put it back together though Still cant figure out why"
659913,Jer,2012-01-24 20:27:00,1426,  ...note to self...no more appliance repair advice from Paul.
659915,mercman,2012-01-24 20:33:00,7054,"  Note to self....Never type what you think, as fast as you think it"
659930,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2012-01-24 21:03:00,0,"man's curiousity can be dangerous eh?  a few months back we took apart a buddies snowmobile to replace a seized steering column.  since we had the motor out we figured we'd replace all the lines, clean the carbs, and rebuild the fuel pump....  fast forward to today and we're still trying to get it to run properly."
659931,motion,2012-01-24 21:04:00,403, Now you tell me............thanks.
659937,johnnyb,2012-01-24 21:14:00,3413,"At least you get points for trying....I will remember this lesson if and when my x67c ever starts to crap out.  Coboconk way, you say?  Too bad about the skunking....get'em next time."
660154,highdrifter,2012-01-25 14:04:00,2534,"Wow that bites Wayne.  Just a though here, but you could try jamming your thumb in the lower corner of the screen and dragging them pixels to the top right hand side..  cheers"
660234,Leecher,2012-01-25 17:47:00,7832,Sorry to hear of the skunkin Wayne... but who needs electronics anyway
660433,irishfield,2012-01-26 02:38:00,26272,"LOL Jacques... the ""video game"" helps put in the day!  Guess I was a week off on the hockey ""rinks""... someone just practicing I guess.. it's this weekend on Sparrow for Princess Margaret Foundation. Their games are still on, while the deal at Deerhurst Resort is totally cancelled after some of their clearing equipment went through the ice yesterday!"
660457,Leecher,2012-01-26 03:19:00,7832," ""video game""   Hope that Deerhurst get safe ice for the event!"
660464,irishfield,2012-01-26 03:30:00,26272,It's cancelled all together Jacques... all the businesses and hotels are already crying on the news. I bet next year the reservations are non- refundable !
660466,Leecher,2012-01-26 03:33:00,7832, Ouch     That's not good
