660567,johnnyb,2012-01-26 13:52:00,3413,Saw this posted on another forum...I thought it was pretty wild....especially considering this was circa 1924.  Video has some great musical accompaniment too  Old School Ice Buggy
660575,I'mHooked,2012-01-26 14:10:00,525,That's pretty cool...wonder if it floats...attach some rod holders.
660577,Leecher,2012-01-26 14:12:00,7832,Impressive indeed
660579,cheaptackle,2012-01-26 14:16:00,849,I saw that posted once before & did a bit of research on it.  The capacities it had were outrageous.  Why we never saw it move into production is beyond me - musta been something like the old beta vs vhs argument with the bombardiers we still see today being the vhs.  It would be very cool to see how today's technologies might re-present this concept.  Michael
