I have been there in the fall but never during the winter, does anyone have any info in regards to how the fishing is this time of year? I am just hopeing to get the boys into some fish. Thanks in advance Jay  If you don't wish to post just shoot me a PM."
660566,johnnyb,2012-01-26 13:49:00,3413,I have yet to hear of a positive icefishing report from that lake.  Hopefully yours will be the first!!!  I've never heard anything bad about the lodge that's on it....just that the fishing is none too productive in the winter.
