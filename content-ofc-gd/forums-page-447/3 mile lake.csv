Anyone ever ice fish this lake or by chance know what species  are in it.  Any tips  would be appreciated.    There are a few 3 mile lakes, the one I'm referring to is in the muskoka are.   Thanks in advance gang!"

Ah yes, the good ole days   :lol:"
660028,Rizzo,2012-01-25 00:42:00,4754,...there you go...drag bottom and see what you get!
660064,Michael_Brown,2012-01-25 02:32:00,411,"Three Mile does have walleye plus bass, panfish and herring. Depending on which are of the lake you staying will make a difference in where you fish."
660147,northernpike56,2012-01-25 13:51:00,717,some nice walleye and a few smaller perch. there are also some big bluegills kicking around  
660150,johnnyb,2012-01-25 13:58:00,3413,"There are a couple of Three Mile Lakes within Muskoka....the one I'm familiar with, close to Raymond, Utterson, Windermere, is known for walleye, but definitely doesn't have herring. Ice fishing is slow, but you can usually run into some good sized perch and the odd walleye.  There is a cottage rental outfit that puts huts out in the winter, and at the deeper end of the lake there are usually a few huts out, anywhere between ""Wonder Beach"" and what I believe is Bathayalcock Island. Keep one line down with a minnow on bottom and another tied in 3 or 4 feet above it, and jig another line aggressively close by.  There isn't a TON of structure in the lake, aside from weeds weeds weeds.  And Lew's tackle collection. Good luck  Of course, you're not far from Lake Rosseau....you will likely be able to get on the ice in Windermere Bay and try for a few lakers"
660181,Michael_Brown,2012-01-25 15:44:00,411," Same lake Three Mile Lake and it certainly has ciscos, I normally call them herring, but the lake does have a good population of them. They are not commonly caught by walleye anglers but we used to catch huge ciscos in the fall in the deeper arm of the lake."
660184,johnnyb,2012-01-25 15:55:00,3413,"Fair enough....I have been fishing the lake for  over 20 years but rarely leave the shallow muddy DeeBank end...have honestly fished Hammell's bay less than 5 times.  Never heard anyone talk about catching cisco/herring in there either....but that bay's definitely deep enough to hold them, and that lake offers up many surprises, so I'll believe you. Heck....there might even be a few brookies left roaming around from way back in the day....."
