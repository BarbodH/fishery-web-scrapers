We were planning on fishing in the Keith Shoal area, but there was too much ice out in the main fishing area, so we headed for Finkles and trolled the north shore of the North CHannel. We started at 0930 and I took this picture to indicate that we had in fact fished at this late date.    Trolled past Lafarge and just before Hogans' Apiary, the inner board with the Fire-tiger Flicker Shad went off and it was a GOOD pull on hte rod. Gradually the fish came closer and the tell-tale flash of the white belly - Mr Pike.... But a nice fish around 12 lbs.    We trolled down wind about 1/2 mile past generating station and the waves were crazy. the east wind and the rollers thru the Upper Gap made fishing difficult. Headed back without the drift sock and the winds really picked up, so we couldn't go fast even if we wanted to - so we trolled back towards Lafarge.  As we neared the boat building factory on Rte 133, the outer board fired and I had to bring the fish in as Laker John was tied up steering the boat. The fish broke the surface and it was another pike, this time it hit the CC Shad (Blue/silver/orange).    We reeled in at the Lafarge dock and motored to Finkles. The winds were pounding and the waves overflowed into the backc of the boat as we were getting it on the trailer, must have had 30 gallons.... Makes the boat real heavy........  As were were getting the gear out of the boat, a car stopped and a chap with a Walleye Derby 2011 hat got out. He wondered if we were the guys who had posted the pictures of Finkles the other day and we said "" That's us!!!""  Nice to met Tim, who was heading to the Old Church for the evening fish. He told us there was 7 inches of ice there, although the ice looks bad, it is ok to fish out there. He hasn't been fortunate for walleye, but many perch.  Nice to meet you and talk - see you again I'm sure.  When we picked up the boat this morning there were 6 portable shelters over on the south side of Hay Bay, they were moving around, so perhaps the fishing wasn't happening.  Looks like there is some fishable ice in Hay Bay.  We aren't sure if today will be the last soft water expedition or not.  Stay Tuned  David  aka  Superdad"
