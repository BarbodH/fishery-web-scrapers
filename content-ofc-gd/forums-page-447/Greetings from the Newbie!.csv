659766,East Luther,2012-01-24 14:00:00,9,"Hello all,  Got introduced to the site from Nipfisher from the OOD forum and thought I would join!  I am an avid hard water angler and have been doing it for over 20 years. I generally fish Nipissing, Quinte and Simcoe for the most part and I mostly target walleye. I usually get out 8-10 times a season and enjoy taking my family for several of those outings. We are from the Grand Valley, ON area and we also do a lot of hunting for Turkey, deer and waterfowl.  Looking forward to the conversations and new friendships in the near future!  Cheers,  East Luther (Jay)"
