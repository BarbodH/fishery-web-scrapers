659686,10point,2012-01-24 02:45:00,165,I am putting a new floor in my boat and replacing the carpet. I have a new sheet of marine plywood so no glue on the floor but the carpet goes up the side of the boats. Do I need to remove the glue up the sides of the boat. I removed a little bit of tonight and it seems like it would take a really long time to get it all off.

659689,mike rousseau,2012-01-24 02:52:00,4661,I saw a show where the guy did this job...  You want to get most of the glue off or at least smooth/flat before glueing the new carpet...

660788,10point,2012-01-26 22:03:00,165,I did some reading about heating it up with a heat gun. Since I don't have a heat gun I tried heating it with a torch and it's working pretty well.
660789,fishingfarmer,2012-01-26 22:03:00,34,I used my grinder .I put a flexible sand paper disc on and this  allowed me to get up under everything .Lots of different ways .This one worked for me.
