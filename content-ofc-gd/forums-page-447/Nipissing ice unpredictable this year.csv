In a lot of places, the thickness will not support a vehicle, said Sheppard a sergeant with North Bay detachment of the Ontario Provincial Police.  “Even for large 4X4s, although the ice is strong enough to support them, the slush makes it difficult to travel,” he said Wednesday.  At least three vehicles have broken through the ice of Lake Nipissing — one off Sunset Point, one in the south end of Callander Bay and one off Deepwater Point on the south shore. And at least six snowmobiles and one snowshoer have broken through the ice of area lakes, swamps and ponds.  Sheppard, who is also an avid fisherman, said this is an unusual year for ice conditions.  He said in past years, people have been able to drive vehicles on Lake Nipissing without difficulty, except after a heavy storm.  But this year “I certainly wouldn’t take my vehicle on it,” he said. “The slush is unbelievable.  “Trout Lake and Nosbonsing are also covered in slush. People are having difficulty moving shacks out to the far points on the lakes even with snow machines and four wheelers.”  Larry Bartlett, a certified ice recovery specialist and owner of Bartlett’s Towing, has recovered about 50 vehicles from lakes and swamps across Northern Ontario.  He said the most common reason people break through is “they just don’t check the ice quality or thickness before they travel on it.”  Bartlett said with a good quality ice — no air, no contamination or foreign substances such as dirt, reeds or cattails which all cause weakness — drivers need at least 10 inches of ice to support a half-ton truck.  Those brave enough to venture onto the ice in a vehicle should be sure they have proper insurance coverage.  “You want to make sure you have comprehensive coverage for sure,” said David Blahey, a broker with All-Risks Insurance.  In the case of a vehicle breaking through the ice, comprehensive insurance will generally cover the cost of recovery, as well as the vehicle.  Owners of new vehicles generally have full coverage (comprehensive and collision) because financing companies and banks require it, but comprehensive coverage is not mandatory.  Sheppard said people should use common sense when it comes to venturing out onto the ice.  “If you don’t see vehicle anywhere, you might err on the side of caution instead of being the first one out to test it. It’s really not worth it,” Sheppard said.  [email protected]"
660629,Rod Caster,2012-01-26 16:09:00,5784,"i paid for no depreciation insurance...time to go for a drive  things look MUCH better as of last night... we 4wheeled out for miles and only hit a few slushy spots with very little snow. Its definitly not truck-ready until we get a few real cold nights to tighten up the slushy layer, but for sleds with scratchers and 4wheelers, it's all good.  Good 'ol Bartletts"
