660063,superdad,2012-01-25 02:32:00,353,"OK all you Hard Core Fishers (and you know who you are) Here's the launch ramp scene as we saw it today.  Laker John & I hit the first stop on the circuit - Finkles Park in Bath.  Looks like a piece of cake getting on the water here.    Here's a shot from  the water side    Travelling along 133 to the ferry, we could see frazil ice in lines off the shore, formed by the winds (they were blowing pretty good today), but the water is open westward past the ferry to almost Q4. The ramp however is TOAST!!!!!!!    For the die-hards, we circled via Hay Bay South and hit the ramp at the Old Church. I wouldn't trust the ice of there until we had a bunch of days, way below 0 degs C.    There were patches of open water ALL over Hay Bay from the junction at Long Reach all the way to the far east end.  BE CAREFUL!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  The weather predictions for the next week indicate only one day - Thursday as the day....................................  Stay Tuned..   David  aka  Superdad"
