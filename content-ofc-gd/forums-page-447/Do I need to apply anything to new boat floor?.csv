659917,10point,2012-01-24 20:35:00,165,I am putting in a new piece of marine plywood in my boat. Do I need to apply any ttyp of stain or anything to it? Carpet will be going over it.
659927,bigbuck,2012-01-24 20:54:00,2449,"No, that's why you use marine grade plywood which is nice and expensive but worth the price. Set it in place, fasten it and then carpet it and you are good to go."
659954,NANUK,2012-01-24 21:59:00,797,"I had part of the floor replaced on my boat last year by a professional  marine shop, they applied 2 coats of sealer on each side of marine plywood  including all the edges,   glued the carpet on when dry and screwed it down  with clear marine adhesive and SS screws. I was told that IÂ’ll never have to worry about that part of the floor for the life of my boat. Looking at the quality of their workmen ship, I believe them !"
659963,trevy727,2012-01-24 22:12:00,351,I just did my floor and yes I put a varnish on it. It turned out real nice. Spar varnish I think its called. Got it at home hardware. It's made for marine applications. I don't even want to cover it now because I looks so nice.

660027,JTorra,2012-01-25 00:36:00,50,I rolled mine with fiberglass resin. Pay extra attention to the edges.
660220,SylvanOwner,2012-01-25 17:35:00,266,I did similar to a previous poster.  Couple coats of marine epoxy and the guys at Noah's said my floor would outlast me.
