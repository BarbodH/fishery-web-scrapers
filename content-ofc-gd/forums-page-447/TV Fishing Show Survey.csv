660619,kickingfrog,2012-01-26 15:51:00,8333, As long as they spell your name correctly.
660623,Harrison,2012-01-26 15:56:00,2202," LOL, that's the fishing world for ya!  Great response."
660628,troutologist,2012-01-26 16:07:00,951,"  Check out this internet based show that a couple of guys from out in MB are doing, some pretty cool stuff.Uncut Angling"
660631,Sharkbait22,2012-01-26 16:13:00,297,Dimestore fisherman is likely one of the worst shows. I remember sharing a peaceful mountain lake in AB with these guys while they filmed.  Poor timing. WAHT A NOISE.
660633,SmokestackLightnin,2012-01-26 16:15:00,390, I bought a cottage last year and part of the furnishings in the place was a stack of OOD magazines that date back to the seventies. Some are proudly stored in the detached bathroom where people sit and reads words you wrote decades ago. Some are in the indoor washroom as well.
660634,asdve23rveavwa,2012-01-26 16:16:00,2690,"  Don't feel bad, Craig.  Those are all great accomplishments.  Making someone laugh is never a bad thing.  Plus, that is one of my favorite fishing show episodes of all time.  Think Bob pretty much p'd himself!"
660641,manitoubass2,2012-01-26 16:28:00,11391, Same here.   
660647,troutologist,2012-01-26 16:44:00,951,"Fishing with Gussy starts on Saturday, Jan 28th   Saturday @ 9am and Sundays at 8:30am on CJBN -320 on Shaw Direct, 224 on Bell, channel 12 in Northwestern Ontario and Global Kenora on Shaw across Canada   Should be a great program."
660712,rob v,2012-01-26 19:21:00,535,  does anyone have an internet link to this episode ?  sounds like it would be fun to watch !!
660716,COUNTRYBOY,2012-01-26 19:40:00,130, OMG...FISHING PORN AT IT'S FINEST
660727,torco,2012-01-26 20:06:00,656,"Voted, definitely didn't have my favorite show which the new fly fisher but I like a lot of those shows as well."
660852,Moosebunk,2012-01-27 00:09:00,3970,"Done Craig.  Agree with Kickingfrog's first post.  Happen to ""like"" a number of shows... don't really have to watch any though.  Would enjoy seeing Hooked With Mark Krupa air again, but the host be me or just someone from planet earth instead.  He's a weird dude... but I guess he made it work though.  Great watching fishing shows in HD from amazing places."
660864,206,2012-01-27 00:34:00,563, Glad i'm not the only one with mind in the gutter!   Yes would be interested in these results myself.   Dave mercer facebooking a link to your survey now as well that should help you a lil.
660917,SmokestackLightnin,2012-01-27 02:29:00,390, Well there goes the independent survey angle. I guess an asterisk should go on the results now.
660926,bigugli,2012-01-27 02:41:00,6138,"He wants to skew the results in his favour, businesses do it all the time. Fishing shows are still businesses hungry for advertising dollars."
660936,SmokestackLightnin,2012-01-27 02:58:00,390,  I know what he's trying to do and you're correct to say the results will be skewed.  I guess the client will learn how competitive the Ontario fishing show industry is and what people will do to get an edge on their peers.
660952,craigdritchie,2012-01-27 03:43:00,1586,Not a biggie. Closed it off earlier today when the sample size target was met.  Thanks to everyone who participated.  Craig
660337,COUNTRYBOY,2012-01-25 22:49:00,130,ALL DONE...DO WE WIN A NEW BOAT OR SOMETHING
660340,craigdritchie,2012-01-25 22:56:00,1586,"Nope, but if there's enough interest I guess we could do a draw to see who gets my Visa bill this month. Anyone else want in?"
660341,MJL,2012-01-25 22:57:00,2427, We do...And I already won
660344,Leecher,2012-01-25 23:14:00,7832,Done... Just wish we could select multiple choices on some questions
660369,spinnerbaitking,2012-01-26 00:04:00,1622,"Done hope it helps, I was going to pass it on after I completed it but it doesn't go to the right page for me to copy it Thanx & Tight LinesSBK"
660370,MCTFisher9120,2012-01-26 00:07:00,3761,"I agree, would of liked to of seen Extreme Angler, I probably wouldn't be a extreme frog fisher if I didn't see Karl and those Snag Proof frogs lol.  Good survey, tell us the results"
660381,adempsey,2012-01-26 00:37:00,1498,"Did anyone else pick Mariko?  I mean, I would prefer to fish with many other hosts but who would pass that up? Lol.  I mean come on:  THIS?    or  THAT?? (no offence Dave )  "
660398,craigdritchie,2012-01-26 01:24:00,1586,"I - thankfully - can't picture Dave in a bikini. Nor do I ever want to. (Sorry big guy!)  Last time I saw Mariko she was about 12 or 13 years old. Yet even then, as I recall, she was a pretty good angler."
660409,Sharkbait22,2012-01-26 01:49:00,297,Ontario shows yes.  The shows reflect the type of fishing done in the area.  I used to really like Sporting Fishing on the Fly when I lived in Alberta. I think that was the name of the show. They often had Brian Chan on explaining rainbow biology. Great stuff.  Really miss that fishing.  Enjoy Adventures North for the dreaming.  Check out this vintage Lee Wulff vid amazing outdoorsman Wings for an Angler 
660414,cynmar,2012-01-26 02:02:00,169,"Done, would have liked a none of the above as well. Would have liked independant fishing store as option on a couple.  Bill"
660418,strik,2012-01-26 02:08:00,175,done
660419,Rattletrap2,2012-01-26 02:11:00,1652,"I did my survey Craig, and I know this has no relevance, but I really like to catch Kim Stricker's Hook N Look. I know, I know, it is American, but I learn the most from his underwater filming! I used to Love Bob Izumi's show in the early days, but it is just one big infomercial today (as are most of the others in your list)."
660420,Nipfisher,2012-01-26 02:13:00,2449,Done. I would have picked Mariko but I am hoping for a free sub from Dave.
660423,DRIFTER_016,2012-01-26 02:22:00,10439,"  Yep ,you remember correctly. It's one of my favorite shows and is extremely informative. Another good Western one is Sport Fishing BC with Mark Pendlington."
660428,mike rousseau,2012-01-26 02:30:00,4661,Thank you... Great film
660586,craigdritchie,2012-01-26 14:43:00,1586,"Rattletrap - there are a whole bunch of other good shows I didn't list (Kim's included). As I've mentioned, those ones are there for a specific reason.  Sharkbait22 - the Lee Wulff video is awesome, thanks for that.  FishingBill - I hear you, but the idea with this is to force you to pick one of the options. I did take the test too, and there were some instances where I would have liked an opt-out answer too.  For what it's worth, I've created this little survey on behalf of someone else who is trying to gain some insight into Canadian fishing shows, primarily serving the Ontario market. I didn't come up with the questions, I just built the survey and am trying to get as many people as possible to complete it.  Thanks to everyone who has taken the time to do so. If you haven't yet done so, please do. And, please pass the URL along to other anglers you now.  Cheers"
660589,asdve23rveavwa,2012-01-26 14:50:00,2690," That makes two of us Rob. Sometimes, on a winter day, I just like to kick back and watch some fishing. As far as Craig on Bob's show, I still chuckle to myself when I think of the episode on the Ganny where Craig finally landed a bow out of a certain hole...after sliding down the bank, and soaking the heck out of himself, lol!!  Sorry, Craig"
660590,Harrison,2012-01-26 14:54:00,2202,"Craig, done my friend, having worked on shows too I wonder if you had an easy time answering as I did on some of those questions.  I am not assuming a new show is on the horizon, but tough to imagine someone coming out with a new show nowadays. I would think the internet/web based would be where to look for the future moving forward and a solid (ground level)investment for potential ""sponsors"".  For example the Surely episodes, I really enjoy them and believe they are on to something."
660591,kickingfrog,2012-01-26 14:56:00,8333, There is a difference between famous and infamous.
660592,SmokestackLightnin,2012-01-26 15:02:00,390," Although your client may want to live the dream with a fishing show I personally think we have enough serving the Ontario market. And for some of them, I think too many. But if he or she can get enough support (read sponsor money) to move forward then have at 'er and good luck."
660595,kickingfrog,2012-01-26 15:11:00,8333, I never considered that this was someone looking to start another fishing show.
660609,bigugli,2012-01-26 15:36:00,6138,"With the questions skewed towards a specific style of response, good possibility, some sponsor is looking for the best bang for the buck."
660615,Old Man,2012-01-26 15:47:00,822,"Personally, I'm looking forward to the debut of Fishing with Gussy. I've enjoyed his segments on Points North in past."
660616,richyb,2012-01-26 15:48:00,774,Done !  Imagine having a shore lunch with Darryl Choronzey? Or a hot day and Mariko decides to get into her bikini? WOWZERS.
660618,craigdritchie,2012-01-26 15:50:00,1586,"Terrific. I spend 25 years writing for fishing magazines across North America, I write a fishing book, I win a bunch of awards for my work, I set two IGFA line class records, I appear on several nationally-syndicated fishing programs .... and I'm remembered as the guy who took a header off the bank and nearly drowned a $6,000 wireless microphone.  LMAO!!!!!!  Yes, the fame and glory of life as an outdoor writer!  Or is it ""outhouse writer?""  I can never really tell."
660276,craigdritchie,2012-01-25 20:42:00,1586,"Hi gang,  Everyone has an opinion, and I'd like to hear yours! Please do me a favour and take three or four minutes out of your day to complete a short survey on Canadian TV fishing shows. I'm doing a little market research and value your input.  Click here to begin the survey.  The questions are all multiple choice, and are structured to accept one answer only, so pick your best from the choices available.  What's it for? Can't really say at the moment, since it is work-related ..... but the information is quite important to me so I'm grateful for your input.  Thanks!"
660280,bushart,2012-01-25 20:54:00,2628,Done it Craig  Was disappointed that Karl Kolonka (sp) did'nt show up in survey---Xtreme angler  I actually enjoy his show very much and pick up some tips  And no we've never met
660283,asdve23rveavwa,2012-01-25 21:01:00,2690,"Done, Craig.  Found the question about buying fishing product based on a fishing tv hosts recommendation the hardest to answer.  Would have liked a ""none of the above"" option on that one.  We all know sponsors are what make the tv world go 'round, and, it is pretty near impossible for any of these hosts to give an unbiased opinion on tackle. Hey, it's just the way it is."
660285,BillM,2012-01-25 21:05:00,17367,No Fly Nation?  Boooo!!!   Best show on WFN!
660287,craigdritchie,2012-01-25 21:08:00,1586,"Bushart - thanks! I like Karl's show too, but there are specific reasons for listing the ones I did and omitting others ... and that's about all I can say since I don't want to skew any results.  Frankie65 - thanks! As someone taking the survey, I would also like a ""none of the above"" or ""all of the above"" option. But as someone who has to analyze the data after, sorry, I need you to pick one.  Thanks, gents, for your input."
660289,esoxansteel,2012-01-25 21:12:00,1307,"  x2  i was thinkin the same thing, at least some thing fly fishing at least"
660291,craigdritchie,2012-01-25 21:18:00,1586,"Bill, liverelease: again, the ones that are listed are there for specific reasons."
660293,I'mHooked,2012-01-25 21:20:00,525,"As much as it'd be nice to spend a day in a boat with Mariko, I don't think we'd get much fishing done! Survey complete."
660295,BillM,2012-01-25 21:22:00,17367,"Craig, voted"
660299,kickingfrog,2012-01-25 21:24:00,8333,"As someone who has watched fishing shows right from early childhood to now (more than 30 years, heck I remember Craig fishin' with Bob many moons ago) I look at the shows through much different eyes now.  I am more likely to be looking for a little bit of entertainment and escapism much like here. Less interested in ""new"" stuff now because by the time the shows air the net has already provided me with most of the information I need to make a decision on yay or nay. This information often starts with the companies web site but always finishes with independent testing sites and forums."
660302,SmokestackLightnin,2012-01-25 21:29:00,390,Since you have requested the members of this board's participation could you please post the results of the survey once it is completed?
660309,LesCulpJr,2012-01-25 21:41:00,75,Done:) Would be interested in seeing the results as well. Though I think I could prob guess a few;)
660310,manitoubass2,2012-01-25 21:43:00,11391,"Done.  One thing I'd like to see is in depth fishing shows. More about what/why/where/how etc. More camera angles of the bait/lures being used. More ""rough cut"" footage would be great too, as that's often where some of the comedy/entertainment comes into play.  The thing I dislike the most about most fishing shows currently on is the amount of advertising versus the actual fishing footage."
660312,Skipper D,2012-01-25 21:50:00,1970,"Done , good luck with your work on this ."
660317,DRIFTER_016,2012-01-25 22:01:00,10439,Done. Seems more like a survey about Ontario fishing shows rather than Canadian ones though.
660320,craigdritchie,2012-01-25 22:07:00,1586,You bet! That's only fair.
660321,craigdritchie,2012-01-25 22:08:00,1586,Fair observation. These were the ones identified for me .... not my own personal picks.
660322,craigdritchie,2012-01-25 22:10:00,1586,"Yes, seeing my sorry carcass on your screen is certainly enough to make anyone look at things through different eyes! Sorry man!"
660324,DRIFTER_016,2012-01-25 22:19:00,10439," Yep, Craig just an observation. To tell you the truth, I really wish they would start re-running The Red Fisher show. Call me old but it was a far better show than 99% of the stuff you see on the tube these days."
660329,Roy,2012-01-25 22:32:00,13728,"Man, you can almost smell who's commissioning that one."
660331,GBW,2012-01-25 22:39:00,8460,Done too
660332,HTHM,2012-01-25 22:41:00,4082,"Done, but I don't watch fishing shows......no cable or sat."
660333,craigdritchie,2012-01-25 22:41:00,1586,"Thanks, everyone. Please pass the URL along ... the more responses, the better."
660335,Parisite,2012-01-25 22:42:00,66,"Done. I hope the results for question # 10 are thrown out if the most desired response is ""specific locations""...just my opinion."
660336,vance,2012-01-25 22:42:00,719,done  vance
