It was a wet rainy day but it was the only day we could make it so we had to go! This was only my second time on Simcoe (went out of Sibbald Point last March).  First we stopped by Casey's for some minnows and advice. I picked up a couple of Simcoe bugs. I had heard about them but had never seen one. Now I own a couple!  The ice was wet and had a lot of water on it. 3-4 inches in spots. The ice underneath was still good and there was a at least 10"" anywhere we drilled. The fishing was not crazy but it was steady. We didn't get any real monsters but my buddy caught his PB at just over 12"".  My best for the day. An average fish by Simcoe standards I know!:    My buddies PB   With all the water on the ice something weird happened when we cut the holes. A whirl pool formed in every hole!! I figure the ice was trying to float up.   I ended up taking about 8 home for a little fish fry with the kids!"

660481,Homer Is King,2012-01-26 03:50:00,305,It was very slippery!! My buddy went down twice. The hardest thing about that was not laughing!!  I did this to my boots:   Works great! I had no problems!
660521,crappieperchhunter,2012-01-26 10:42:00,2582,  You got out and got some fish..good job   In 30 years of perching Simcoe I have never had a good day for perch when the water is swirling down the holes like that so don't feel bad if you didn't pound them.  BTW nice job on the boot modification. I did the same to mine so I to have traction all the time as well
660526,fishingfarmer,2012-01-26 11:38:00,34, This year we need to take advantage of what days we can get out.The weather has changes so much you don't know one week to the next.Nice to see you got some fish for your troubles.Nice job.
