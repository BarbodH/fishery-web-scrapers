804685,Musky or Specks,2013-08-23 21:56:00,2710,Musky Fishing isn't about day trips on Georgian Bay. You need to fish consecutive days in hopes of being on the right peice of water at the right time. The KW chapter of MCI use to hold their outings out of Honey harbour and we could go years without a single fish being caught by 20 + boats. Now when a fish gets caught its normally a very big fish but if your only interested in catching a musky I suggest the Kawarthas not Georgian Bay.Baits catch fisherman not Musky. Fish a bait you have confidance in and keep it in the water.
