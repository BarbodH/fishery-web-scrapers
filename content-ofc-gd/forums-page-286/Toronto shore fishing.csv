804473,shimano19,2013-08-22 17:14:00,196,I've been doing some reaserch and haven't found much...is there any areas in Toronto near lakeshore I can fish? I'm mainly looking for pike or bass but would like to fish carp aswell since the fight is awesome. I will be fishing on-shore. It's on my way home from work so might as well let the traffic pass and wet a line!

804509,chris_robinson,2013-08-22 21:43:00,14,"You should still be able to get a free copy of the book ""Fishes of Toronto"" from Toronto Public Libraries (at the least, they should have a copy in the system to loan), part of the city's Biodiversity series of booklets.  It includes some basics of fishing in Toronto, including some spots.  You can also check in with the Toronto Urban Fishing Ambassadors, they would know the ins and outs. http://torontourbanfishing.com/  I'll also point out that I posted news yesterday of a series of public meetings to consult with anglers about an urban recreational fishing plan for Greater Toronto & Area; the meetings will probably also be informative on where the opportunities are, and you can tell MNR, TRCA, and the city about how you think they should improve and market fishing in Toronto.  My post is under Announcements.  Yours in Conservation, Chris Robinson OFAH FMZ 20 Advisory Council Member"
