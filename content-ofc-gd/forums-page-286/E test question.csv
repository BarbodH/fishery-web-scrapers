804023,Sinker,2013-08-20 14:19:00,8692,"I don't understand how an invalid license sticker invalidates my insurance....please explain.  I'm going to look into that myself, but I""m interested to hear your explanation.  S."
804028,BillM,2013-08-20 14:49:00,17367," Why are you trying to change the subject?   The subject here isn't why OBD was put into place..  You stated that if your car shows a CEL or MIL it's based around the emissions system (or somehow will affect the emissions system), which is absolutely incorrect.     Manufacturers have been using OBD to store codes for almost every single system in the car.   You think because I've got a CEL for my airbag system that's got something to do with emissions?  Perhaps you should have said 'most' CELs instead of all CEL's..."
804039,DanD,2013-08-20 15:20:00,2223,"I'm talking the CHECK ENGINE LIGHT NOT an air bag, traction control or a maintenance reminders. If a check engine light comes on, it has something to do with emissions. Who in the frig said anything about the other tell tail lights????? You can have your dashboard lit up like a Xmas tree; as long as the CHECK ENGINE LIGHT is off who gives a rat's turd as far as emissions go. Where did you and I get so side tracked? I guess it's maybe because I have never called a trac light, ABS light or an air bag light, a CEL light; to me it has always been a check engine; sorry if I didn't make that clear.  Dan.  Oh I forgot to add; in your last sentence you say; ""I've got a CEL for my air bag"". Ah the acronym CEL stands for CHECK ENGINE LIGHT!"
804041,redpearl99,2013-08-20 15:36:00,259,I'm fairly sure it's a part of every standard insurance policy.  The driver has certain obligations in order to maintain continuous coverage. one of those obligations is to ensure you have a valid vehicle license.
804042,Thrilla,2013-08-20 15:36:00,164,pc of electrical tape over that check engine light will fix it
804043,redpearl99,2013-08-20 15:38:00,259,"btw, I can confirm that an airbag light will not affect your E-test.  My airbag light is flashing and I still passed a few weeks ago, they only care about the CEL"
804047,BillM,2013-08-20 16:07:00,17367," No worries man, I had a feeling we go sidetracked somewhere, lol!    FYI, in my VW, I'll get the 'CEL' or 'MIL' or whatever you want to call it for any type of malfunction..  airbag, whatever.  Same light, different codes (obviously)"
804067,John Bacon,2013-08-20 16:53:00,3277, Lots of people drive with expired stickers.  I have never heard of a single person having a claim denied due to an expired sticker.  I don't think this will impact insurance.
804070,Woodsman,2013-08-20 17:21:00,1286,Don't think too hard. Insurance companies are looking for any legal way out of paying off claims. If you give them one they'll sure take it. As stated earlier just call your insurance company & ask.
804073,mike rousseau,2013-08-20 17:37:00,4661,To clarify...  It wasn't transmission...  It's code P0010  Which when searched is most likely a camshaft solenoid actuator or something like that...  The only symptom we are getting is hard shifting.... If I reset the CEL the problem goes away for a while....
804132,Burtess,2013-08-20 21:32:00,901,"  Yup, that was me... personally.... and totally true.  Pipe coming from the engine, passing through catalytic converter, straight pipe where the muffler had been, and through the resonator and to the tail pipe.  Tech mentioned the muffler missing and I questioned that the muffler does only that - muffle noise - and since the catalytic converter was intact, that he should test the van.  He did and it indeed passed, which makes sense.  Burt"
804169,aplumma,2013-08-20 23:43:00,6896,Lets keep this factual and light hearted I would like to keep this open for awhile.   Thanks   Art
804180,mike rousseau,2013-08-21 00:07:00,4661,They did test it...  It failed....
804198,Sinker,2013-08-21 01:13:00,8692,"So, now what?  This whole E-test thing maddens me to no end.  Check what's coming out the damn pipe and see if it fails. Such a SCAM!!!  S."
804199,Uncle Buck,2013-08-21 01:15:00,1000,"for them to etest your vehicle it needs to have a certain amount of emissions data in the computer.  If you clear your check engine light, it clears your emission data and your car is not ready for the test  if you don't drive your car often, same thing, it will not have enough data for the test... they will take your money and send you home  not having enough data doesn't mean your car fails, it means your car doesn't pass  after 2 failure to reads you get a conditional pass and you'll be able to get your sticker no repair is necessary, but they next time it needs an etest, it will need to have the data or it will fail..."
804241,vance,2013-08-21 03:51:00,719,93 pick up with 350 k on it passed the etest 4 years ago 2 days later the engine was taken out  THERE WERE NO WORKING SENSORS ON THE ENGINE all the wires were rotted off BUT it was perfect in the eyes of the computer  go figure.........
804242,redpearl99,2013-08-21 03:54:00,259,a 93 pick up wouldnt have been tested via the OBD port so the lack of sensors or wires wouldnt mean anything.  Vehicles that old are manually tested via the smoke pipe.
804243,vance,2013-08-21 03:59:00,719,you just had to burst my balloon lolololol
803870,mike rousseau,2013-08-19 17:54:00,4661,Can your check engine light be on when you go for an E test...?  My wife's car is getting a code that has to do with her transmission.... And she was told if you check engine light is on you fail... But the transmission has nothing to do with emissions....  Anybody know the answer to this one?
803871,BillM,2013-08-19 17:57:00,17367,"If it's not apart of the emissions equipment, it shouldn't fail.     They'll pull the codes when she gets it done.  Also, don't try and pull the battery to reset the light, all you'll do is reset the readiness monitors as well, then you'll DEFINITELY not pass, lol."
803876,Lape0019,2013-08-19 18:24:00,647,"I believe it is new this year but it doesn't matter what the problem is, if the check engine light is on, it is an automatic fail. Don't gen bother going if the light is on."
803877,Roy,2013-08-19 18:45:00,13728,"Mike, the Ministry of the Environment  website says that you'll likely fail if the check engine light is on. Read it here.  http://www.ene.gov.on.ca/environment/en/category/drive_clean/STDPROD_104964.html"
803878,redpearl99,2013-08-19 18:47:00,259,"they wont pull the code to see what the problem is, a CEL is an automatic fail"
803881,Renegade67,2013-08-19 18:59:00,86,"Hopefully your code is intermittant and does not come back right away after clearing.   If it comes back within a couple of hours of operation then you need to repair the problem, clear the codes and drive it for a couple of days so it will be in a ready state to test.   Hopefully you know someone with a code reader or laptop/cable/software that can do this. Or as Bill mentioned you could unhook the battery overnight.  k Darn money grab!  I believe southern Ontario is the only region left in Canada doing this Bull."
803882,BillM,2013-08-19 19:00:00,17367," Man, read the website..   lol..   Like I said before, if it's not emissions related, you shouldn't fail the test.  "
803885,mattp33,2013-08-19 19:14:00,290,We do drive cleans here at the dealership and if the check engine light is on for ANY reason it will fail.  We will not even hook up the machine if its on.
803886,OhioFisherman,2013-08-19 19:17:00,6623,"Here in Ohio a check engine light on is a fail, they won't even bother until it is repaired."
803890,Headhunter,2013-08-19 19:23:00,5703,"Just some aside info for yah... if your vehicle is older than 1999, then a check engine light will not fail the test. The vehicle is subjected to the old test and can pass that as long as it meets the old requirements. Vehilce ""newer"" than 1999 has to be put through the ""new"" test. One of the (OK, only!) advantages of owning an older vehicle. HH"
803891,mattp33,2013-08-19 19:26:00,290, Yes...I should have noted that.  Not sure what year the OP vehicle is
803893,DanD,2013-08-19 19:57:00,2223,"I have a couple of customers that have a reoccurring code and light on; that myself and a number of shops haven't been able to find the root cause. How I got them through the test, is I'd cleared the code and take it for the test before the light came back on; knowing that it was going to fail due to the monitors not being in the ready state. Let the customer drive it for a week or so and do the same thing. After a vehicle has failed twice due to monitors not ready; they will run a 2 speed idle test and if the tail pipe is clean you get a pass.  Dan."
803895,redpearl99,2013-08-19 20:19:00,259,^good trick
803903,Burtess,2013-08-19 21:27:00,901,I had my van tested with the CEL on and no muffler (just a straight pipe from the cat to the resonator) and they tested it and it passed lol...  Burt
803905,Terry,2013-08-19 21:37:00,14456,"what garage, they are about to get busy"
803917,Canuck2fan,2013-08-19 22:49:00,1444,"I don't see how any garage can automatically fail a vehicle with a check engine light on when the Ministry says in some cases the car could still pass, depending on the reason for the light. Maybe the garages that are handing out auto fails for it should be sent back for retraining as they obviously didn't get it right the first time. A few thousand dollar fine might smarten them up too."
803945,Sinker,2013-08-20 01:21:00,8692,"The whole thing is a total scam.  I have a CEL on in my car, that has nothing to do with emissions, and they won't even hook my car up.  I refuse to have it repaired. Could be a million little things wrong. I'm driving with an expired sticker right now, and when I get pulled over, I plan on going to court to fight it. Whether I win or lose, the judge is going to hear a long story,because the exaust coming out my tailpipe is perfectly fine, and would pass any other test easily.  They have to catch me first  If I can make it through the year, I'll but a sticker next year when I'm not required to do emissions!!  S."
803947,Richie Razor,2013-08-20 01:26:00,536,^^^ what a rebel.   I agree it's a total joke. Fight the power!!!
803952,Sinker,2013-08-20 01:36:00,8692,"Not a rebel at all. As far as I'm concerned, everyone should do the same! Biggest scam going! I'm sure I'll get nailed at some point, but I'm kind of looking forward to it!  S."
803990,Woodsman,2013-08-20 05:13:00,1286,You do realize you are also driving without valid insurance? No valid sticker invalidates your insurance no matter if you've already paid or not. Your insurance company doesn't give a rat's arse if your trying to make a point. If they can slide on any claim they will. Also the fines for this are far more than no valid sticker.
803998,DanD,2013-08-20 11:05:00,2223," It's not the garages that are handing out the automatic fails, it's MOE and they (the garages for the most part) are following the rules set out by MOE. Believe me this is one of the most stringently enforced programs that has ever been put out by the government. If an inspector is not following procedures properly, it doesn't take long before he and the test facility are fined, suspended or booted out of the program. It's went the inspector doesn't explain the process and rules properly is when the confusion starts. When a vehicle comes in with the check engine light on, they are not suppose to refuse to test the vehicle; but explain that the vehicle will likely fail because of and leave the choice to the owner whether to have it tested or not. The inspectors that are refusing to test the vehicle are just being lazy because they know they are going to have to go through the whole procedure and then have to face the owner telling them it has failed and why. Why test a vehicle that we know or think will fail; the test will give the owner the trouble code letting them know what system is affected and it entitles the owner the use of the $450.00 repair cost limit for a conditional pass. As for codes dealing with things like transmission that has turned on the light; hell yea that affects emissions. If there's a clutch pack slipping or the converter isn't locking up; you are burning more fuel to get the vehicle moving or keeping it at speed. The only time a check engine light will come on is when there's an issue with a system that may increase emissions by 15%; that is written right in the base program of every vehicle. So just because you cannot feel any running issues when the light pops on doesn't mean that it's just the dumb light.  Dan."
804005,BillM,2013-08-20 12:37:00,17367," Where did you come up with this?     That's absolutely incorrect, lol."
804009,DanD,2013-08-20 13:09:00,2223,"Being an inter-provincial licensed technician (Mechanic if you're not sure what that is) for the last 37 years; along with being a repair tech and inspector for the drive clean program. I have operated my own repair facility for the last 30 year and work with the local high schools in their coop programs teaching the young and up coming techs. I could list all the up-dating classes I have taken and taught but why bother. And YES OBD I and OBD II were solely brought out for emissions sake; but now that the electronics have improved so much, we're also benefiting with fuel mileage and power. Do your homework before you contradict someone.  Dan.  ."
804013,Headhunter,2013-08-20 13:56:00,5703,"A buddy of mine is somewhat of a ""rebel"" for lack of a better term. He refused to pay for the plate sticker claiming that it was a reduculous cost. Ran his company vehicle for four years before he was pulled over for not having a valid license plate sticker. The fine at the time was around $120.00. He figured that he was ahead by well over four hundred before the fine. I don't believe he has a plate sticker on his curent vehicle either.... HH"
804022,Old Ironmaker,2013-08-20 14:18:00,8243,"If you don't have a valid sticker you don't have valid insurance. If any doubt call your agent.  How in hell can a vehicle pass an emissions test with a straight pipe and no muffler? I know, everything on the internet is true!"
