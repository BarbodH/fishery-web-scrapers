804444,mike rousseau,2013-08-22 13:41:00,4661,Thanks... Everyone...  This tournament is the most important day of my year... There are anglers in this event that my dad used to tell us stories about as kids... Half the boats have 30+ years experience fishing this area...  This is 2 years in a row we placed 2nd... Last year we missed first by 0.5lbs... This year 0.1lbs... And to compete with my brother is great...
