(Whitby)  I've never really heard of this but they tell me it's out there...and willing to drive to get it...  Thanks in advance, Tiz"
804090,Old Man,2013-08-20 19:19:00,822,"Kerosene is available at most hardware stores such as Rona, Home Depot or Canadian Tire. All Kerosene is distilled from crude oil, as are diesel, naptha, gasoline etc. All just removed as different fractions from crude oil during distillation."

804099,tizfun,2013-08-20 20:14:00,292,"Thanks (Old Man)..   I was told that the kerosene sold at these places isn't distilled... If it is, then I'm good to go....  Tiz"
804103,Twocoda,2013-08-20 20:19:00,4130,If you can find it at the pump you will save huge...Ilderton sells it at the pump...(you said you were willing to drive)
804486,bubbles,2013-08-22 18:48:00,591,What do you want it for?
804488,Terry,2013-08-22 18:56:00,14456,"my guess   well kerosene , most likely use it in a heater or lamp   but most  people who call it  Distilled Kerosene  are looking  for a cure for cancer"
