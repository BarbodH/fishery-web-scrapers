Nice new Black Ford F-150 with personalized paltes and a beautiful Skeeter boat in tow , I walked up to the passenger window and knocked gently,  both Lew and Mrs were looking West ( music must've been loud ), Lew pulled away , I slapped his box side and waved goodbye .. Just had to share .  Randy ."

It's funny but we always stop there on the way home for gas and a Timmies, and ever since I first  ran into you there a few years back I always look for you.  Next time be a bit more forceful when you're banging on my window, my old ears aren't that they used to be."
