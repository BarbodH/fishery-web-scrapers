804322,lew,2013-08-21 20:07:00,12766,"I was fishing Nippissings West Arm this morning and things began getting a little crowded.  It was very windy and I was a ways away so the picture is a bit blurry, but you get the idea  "
804323,misfish,2013-08-21 20:11:00,29133,"I have notice a great reduction in their numbers on Simcoe and Couch this year. Have not seen the hundred bird crowds at all. Maybe 6-8 in a bunch,thats it."
804324,davey buoy,2013-08-21 20:14:00,5505,"Was near a point guys Saturday,and the bare tree was full of them.There was no shortage in that tree I'll say."
804325,Sinker,2013-08-21 20:17:00,8692,They've started to migrate. Give it a month and you will see them EVERYWHERE!! I wish I could shoot them! I'd be first in line to buy the license!  S.
804327,Bill Shearer,2013-08-21 20:19:00,456,"I was fishing the Grand between Caledonia and Cayuga. A flight of 200 went overhead. I hope they were headed for some Farmers pond, but the reality is likely lake Erie. Damn things are relentless in the search for easy food"
804331,woodenboater,2013-08-21 20:34:00,2277,I like this passage from the MNR page...  Lethal action is a last resort
804332,captpierre,2013-08-21 20:36:00,2521,I was thinking the other day about pressure on panfish at the cottage on Pigeon .  Folks are saying #s are down  Cormorants Osprey Blue Herons Loons Otters Muskies Walleye Fishermen  They better have a lot of sex or they'll disappear
804339,Rich Clemens,2013-08-21 21:05:00,3131,How about a couple fish pictures. ...
804341,Twocoda,2013-08-21 21:08:00,4130,There has to be laws against this many different species having sex with each other....but intersting enough...what do you get when you cross a fisherman with a 57 inch Musky              One happy fisherman (get your minds out of the gutter)
804342,lew,2013-08-21 21:09:00,12766," Don't have any Rich, the cormorants ate all the muskies"
804352,mukluk,2013-08-21 21:45:00,196,Just wondering how many would remain behind in that cluster if a fellow fired 3 rounds of #6 shot; 3 inch magnum at 40 yards.
804376,Sinker,2013-08-22 00:37:00,8692,"I'm not sure, but at 20yds, there would be a lot of feathers flying, and I can reload pretty quick! LOL  The number of these things in the kawarthas come october is mind blowing. They have to have an effect of fish populations. I never saw one around here until 4-5 yrs ago, and now there are thousands and thousands of them!!  S."
804379,Richie Razor,2013-08-22 00:47:00,536,Nice excuse. Lol
804382,Rizzo,2013-08-22 01:02:00,4754,should've raked a double 10 across the top of that rock...you'd be eatin tonight! Nice little bbq
804414,ch312,2013-08-22 04:26:00,1590," Maybe a few rounds of 3 1/2"", #4 buck at 40-50 yards? I don't think you'd see too many flying away"
804430,Rich,2013-08-22 11:12:00,3927,I've seen no effect on fishing in places they've been for a long time.
804432,TroutnMuskieHunter,2013-08-22 11:27:00,1362,I counted 15 cormorants in front of my place here on the Ottawa River...I've never seen that many swimming together since I've been here for the past 16yrs.
804433,lew,2013-08-22 12:07:00,12766,"But it's not all bad cause within a 1/4 mile of the cormorants there's  Osprey,  Bald Eagles and Golden Eagles, but I haven't gotten close enough to the Goldens for a picture yet.  I love seeing this stuff    "
804442,Twocoda,2013-08-22 13:22:00,4130,fish or no fish...you definitely didnt get skunked..the birds of prey are worth the admission alone...
804451,lew,2013-08-22 14:11:00,12766," Your right about that, I could watch those birds all day long.  We had a mink (I think) run across the front lawn yesterday and then almost immediately  a Golden Eagle started circling 50 above my head so I assume he was after the little guy, but I never got to the camera in time."
804530,Lungelarry,2013-08-22 23:20:00,294,"Time to get a real camera,Lew. I got a DSLR and 400mm, and after 30 years fishin,I,m taking more pics than fishing. Change bof pace is good for us old guys."
804538,Whopper,2013-08-23 00:16:00,2174,I guess I hit the wrong rock lol
