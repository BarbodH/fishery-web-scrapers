803818,emjay88,2013-08-19 03:08:00,70,"Hi All, I created a pdf photo essay of our trip this year to Attawapiskat River chasing pike and walleye. It was a week long fly in starting June 1st.  Pike were just getting shallow and still in full spawning mode.  Eddie North's place was once again such a treat to visit for a week. Truly a magical to visit and the best pike and walleye fishing I have ever experienced.  This was my second year going up there and again set a new pb for some monster pike!

803820,Joeytier,2013-08-19 03:26:00,3990,Awesome!  Very nice presentation...looks like you were playing photographer just as much as fisherman!  Very cool that you ended up getting mixed in with good group of strangers
803821,emjay88,2013-08-19 03:33:00,70,Thanks. We made a short video of the adventure as well.  This was our first kick at the can editing a video.
803845,DanD,2013-08-19 12:01:00,2223,"Thanks for posting; I can't believe that it's been a year since my brother and I were there.  That river is always changing; with-in the 10 days we were there, it had dropped at least 4 feet. It was good though it stopped us from getting into a rut and fishing the same areas and tactics; we were always changing things up to keep on top of the fish. There was this one jointed rap that was my best walleye producer; it was retired to the rafters of the main lodge, after the lip broke off bouncing it over some rocks. Thanks again for posting.  Dan.  "
803848,woodenboater,2013-08-19 12:48:00,2277,great video ! nice edits and variety of b roll. But what was up with that piggybacking frogger ??
803861,adempsey,2013-08-19 16:17:00,1498,"Entertaining video and great article!   Looking forward to some more of that in the near future.   Didn't your parents have ""the talk"" with you?"
803869,can u fish,2013-08-19 17:39:00,326,Great report Matt and a lot of great photos you mentioned your fishing partner had limited experience with walleye and northerns well after a trip like that he has deffinetly gained some.  Cheers Mitch...
803872,Jds63,2013-08-19 17:59:00,1365,cool video and loved the style of the report ... your last days pike were just brutes !!!
803965,corvette1,2013-08-20 02:24:00,1765,awesome video and trip congrats
803989,emjay88,2013-08-20 04:51:00,70,"Thanks for responses everyone.  I saw that lure in the lodge Dan.  Isn't that always the way? One lure just works the best any given week.  Last year my go to pike lure was a simple white spinner bait, yet this year it was the in line mepps musky killer, silver blade and white and black maribou.  The Johnson's silver minnow tipped with a white twister tail also worked well, especially being very weedless.  Our biggest producer for Walleye was a silver husky jerk and the rogue worked well too.  The pattern was totally different from last year, but that's what makes it fun. Trying to figure it out. Cheers, Matt"
