804490,bucktail,2013-08-22 19:18:00,1857,For the second time in 2 weeks I got skunked on Lake 0 this morning. Ive been launching out of Oakville just looking for steelies and teenage Kings with VERY BAD LUCK water this mornning was 58 degrees surface but now tons of bait have finally moved into the area after being very sparce for the last few weeks. Problem I think is the small number of fish present have so much food its making a bad bite even worse.  Any one been out of Bronte for matures the last 2 weeks?  OH and 2 trips to the Blue Zone have been almost as bad!  Where are the fish??????  Darren

804531,Sinker,2013-08-22 23:29:00,8692,Just because they're. Weighed at port hope doesn't mean they were caught there. There's no weigh in from whitby to port hope! Definitly seems better out this way though!  S.
804534,spincast,2013-08-22 23:37:00,3279,Its been a tough year all over the big O this year. They just aren't following their normal patterns. My normal go to's have been vacant on more than one occasion. Keep on searchin' it's a big lake and they're n there somewhere
804552,redpearl99,2013-08-23 01:43:00,259,The charters today at credit were coming out with 1-2 fish each.  It wasn't too good.
804563,BillM,2013-08-23 03:25:00,17367,"Lots of fish are either staging or headed back to the US side..  Pretty much par for the course in August.  I'll be hitting Lake O this weekend, we'll see how it goes."
804588,Duckie,2013-08-23 12:29:00,305,A lot of fish are in fact heading to the US side because the prices at the US Targets are still better.
804590,BillM,2013-08-23 12:39:00,17367, LOL!  Best reason I've heard yet
804621,Headhunter,2013-08-23 16:01:00,5703,"We had our toughest day yet this year on Sunday out of Frenchmans. One Coho and one Steelie and a number of shakers was all we netted Sunday morning. We did have a number of knock offs, but couldn't seem to get the fish to hold the bait/get a good hook set. 200 to 300 ft of water seemed to be the most productive... HH"
