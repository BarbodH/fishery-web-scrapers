804429,steelhedrmatt,2013-08-22 10:45:00,278,Its all about the speed. I usually troll walleye at 0.9 - 1.3 mph. get a couple of large trolling bags. should do the trick.
804431,wormdunker,2013-08-22 11:24:00,1711,Welcome to the board.  You'll have lottsa fun here.  I troll Erie alot but using only harnesses & bottom bouncers.  Never had much luck with stick baits.  We use a 5 gallon pail or sometimes 2 to slow down the boat.  We are trolling at 1.5 - 2 mph.  Good luck!
804436,Fang,2013-08-22 12:14:00,1330,"As stated, trolling speed is key, even with the stickbaits and spoons I find no more that 1.8-1.9 for hard baits and 1.0 for worm harnesses. Larger blades in purples, greens are first to go down on my boat.  Most productive rods are dipseys on #2-3 setting and snap weights off the boards. If I do run a line directly behind the boat it's always leadcore. I never run riggers out their as they just have never really produced for the walleye on the western end. I will run the more east when there are more bows around"
804438,dave524,2013-08-22 12:27:00,4508,"Don't hestitate to forget about shoals and reefs , these are not normal walleye, like L.O. think suspended fish and try more off shore."
804440,Fish4Eyes,2013-08-22 13:05:00,1022,"My motor has a similar idle speed to yours and a drift sock can put me around .9 - 1.3 mph. I only tried it once so far, but I do find boat control is much more difficult with the drift sock out and hooked onto the bow (even with a tiller). Not sure if I had too much rope out on the drift sock (10') or if the 2' chop was moving the drift sock off alignment with the bow. Maybe somebody with some more experience in doing this will chime in. Drift sock ain't bad to have in your arsenal anyways for those rough days when you want to drift. They start at 35$ish for the smaller ones and increase in price for the bigger ones."
804454,Roy,2013-08-22 14:23:00,13728,"Until you can get the kicker installed I think your best bet will be to  fish windy days (walleye chop) . It won't take much wind to get you moving. Position your boat upwind of where you want to fish and drop a bottom bouncer with  a 3'-4' lead with a floating worm harness attached, That setup will do as much damage as any other at any time of the year for walleye."
804456,Headhunter,2013-08-22 14:33:00,5703,"I agree with the others, slow down and get one of these... http://www.amazon.com/Precision-Trolling-The-Trollers-Bible/dp/0966301722 Also, finding 60 ft of water has helped in the past as well... and don't forget to try orange coloured blades as well!

804457,Old Ironmaker,2013-08-22 14:38:00,8243,There are very few reports of Walleye out of Nanticoke for a few weeks. They were out at the elbow of Long Point Bay but they seem to have moved west to PT. Bruce.<br /><br />As for trolling speeds they want 2.5 to 3.0 out there now. So like everything else in fishing nothing is standard.<br /><br />Lake conditions have been OK for a few days but only early mornings. It's kicking up right now.
804466,corvette1,2013-08-22 16:19:00,1765,dispy's back 180 & 150 with wormharnes 1.3 to 1.7 mph i was in dunkirk

804575,steelhead75,2013-08-23 08:57:00,35,"thanks for all the replies guys and the warm welcome to the board,  i guess i pretty much answered a lot of my questions and was on the right track, now i just need some patince i guess. the drift idea had crossed my mind and with a 150 V6 . definetly a cheaper option. will give that a try on a fw days when i get back to canada. dam i miss my other girlfreind as the wife calls her.  if any of you are planning or thinking about saltwater flats fishing, dont hesitate to msg me as i have fished all over the world , as my job is lucky enough to provide me the opputunity for that in many locations?  actually i think i wi;l work on a post of different places i have fished and the guides and rates as well as some other tips. on the places i have been  chers and thanks again "
