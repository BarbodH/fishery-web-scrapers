804547,pike slayer,2013-08-23 01:02:00,1177,thats pretty cool but i dont want to spend alot money and im in the sault.
804549,Cudz,2013-08-23 01:05:00,2652,Plasti dip is too expensive for large areas as you need to do 4 coats. Lots of pickup trucks in fort Mac are either half bedliner or full bedliner on all body panels. I have seen the whole truck painted in bedliner a few times.  It works very well but adds some weight to the vehicle.  IT is pretty common practice up there
804562,BillM,2013-08-23 03:24:00,17367,Plastidip isn't going to help against rocks day after day.  Get some spray on bedliner and do it that way... Hell even roll on would work.
804577,RangerGuy,2013-08-23 09:27:00,564,"I am planning to have the bottom of my b bumpers & panels done in LineX. We have a friend who has a black pick up he did this and it has stood up very well, looks good to.  My truck is silver so it should look good as well with all my black trim and lights etc.  All though I'm not sure if you have a linex place up in the Sault."
804584,Lape0019,2013-08-23 12:01:00,647,My buddy has an s10 zr2 and the paint was flaking at the bottom of the fenders. His hadn't started rusting so before that happened he brought it to lined and had them lined the bottom if the truck to the body line a of ten inches up. I think it looks really good would consider doing it myself if I ever had a problem. His truck is white and the lines is black so it looks good.
804614,Twocoda,2013-08-23 14:59:00,4130,Just make sure the coating you consider isnt brittle when cured like Rhino...your cheapest route is to mask off and shoot on a rubberized rocker guard...if you dont top coat it ...touch ups will be cheap and simple as needed...
804616,Ainsley,2013-08-23 15:20:00,142,"I used rocker panel coating (rubberized, similar to bedliner but more flexible) on my plastic bumpers and lower door cladding. I top coated it in a satin black bumper coating for UV resistance. This is what a buddy that owns an auto body shop suggested for my application."
