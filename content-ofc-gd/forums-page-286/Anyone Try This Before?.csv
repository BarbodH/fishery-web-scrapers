804222,fishinguypat,2013-08-21 02:45:00,547,Do you think this would be effective one Lake O? It looks easier said than done http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AzpGQWqFEUo
804224,BillM,2013-08-21 02:47:00,17367,Maybe in the bluezone when the fish are in the top 60ft or so.  I wouldn't call this an effective technique for Lake O salmon or trout.
804228,kickingfrog,2013-08-21 03:04:00,8333,It looks like they are staging fish.
804240,John Bacon,2013-08-21 03:47:00,3277,A Chinook on bass or walleye tackle would be fun though.
804244,sauce,2013-08-21 04:22:00,219,"Never tried jigging for salmonids in open water but have had success slow jigging in current. Subtly swim a jig with a 3"" or 4"" power minnow within 2 feet of bottom. Most bites feel like your jig somehow became a big sponge. Kind of a wierd sensation to describe. But once you set the hook on a sponge it doesn't take long to realize you are attached to a silver torpedo.  AWESOME!!"

804460,highdrifter,2013-08-22 14:58:00,2534,I jig em in the Glenn... Wicked fun!!!  
804532,Ralph Field,2013-08-22 23:30:00,1018,"I think that with the fish finder he had it would be fun to try, but you would have to know that the fish were below you."
804533,spincast,2013-08-22 23:34:00,3279,"I believe one of this year's GLA (?) mags  had an article on how productive this can be in the right circumstances.  I'm sure that for an experienced jig fisherman, on the right water on the right day  this'll put fish in the boat."
804539,Fang,2013-08-23 00:20:00,1330,Asolutely it works. I've been chucking plastics off the piers for a few years now. Swim baits have been better for me though.  If you notice in their video they are fishing the harbor opening from main lake to a fairly large inlet area. Many USA ports on Michigan. Erie and lake Ontario have much more elaborate breakwall and harbor areas so intercepting moving fish is easier. They look to be anchored in the middle of the harbor which is pretty nuts though.  Trust me instead of chucking a Lil cleo all day with the horde tie on a weighted swim bait or work a Berkley gulp weighted off the breakwall. I had some nice bows this spring off Bronte in April this way. Yet to get out this fall but my shad swim baits are ready to go.
