804645,mercman,2013-08-23 18:56:00,7054,"I just got my new Okuma Strata Master SM20 in last nite. Looks like the Convector, but sexier LOL. Can't wait to use it."
804647,fishsevern,2013-08-23 19:03:00,112,I have 2 outfits....one is for casting 7 ft heavy action shimano rod with a calcutta 200 and the other is a 8ft medium heavy rod with shimano triton reel.  I used the triton for niagara musky and handled a near 40 pounder nicely to the boat until the worst net job in the world happened.   Handled the initial strike no problem as the extra length and softer tip worked well.
804649,Fisherpete,2013-08-23 19:05:00,1814,"Love my Tekota - worth every penny. Also recently picked up an Okuma Coldwater for salmon fishing - it's pretty sweet and worth the extra $30 or so compared to a Convector in my opinion. I also have an Abu 7000i that has been used a couple of times - I was going to use it for casting muskie baits but it is rather heavy and better suited as a trolling reel. It is for sale if you are interested - $120 spooled with 40lb mono and includes box, papers and a neoprene Shimano case. Pm me if interested."

804654,Sinker,2013-08-23 19:28:00,8692,"Yes, for the price, ya can't beat the okuma's. I have several, and they do work great, but the drag creep pulling dipsy's drives me crazy. The Tekota's are the best for that.....ya just can't beat the tekota's. Sure they cost a little more, but they are the best I've used.  S."
804722,miller,2013-08-24 01:42:00,223,Stay away from Rapala's they tend to wear out fairly quickly and if you're looking for repairs they don't even sell parts to repair techs so unless you deal with them directly you're out of luck.
804723,monterey guy,2013-08-24 01:55:00,12,used shimano triton for many years no problems bought an okuma cold water this year love it !!!!!
804729,BillM,2013-08-24 03:18:00,17367,"I've used the Rapalas a few times, it sounds like they are about to break apart anytime a fish pulls some drag, lol."
804732,mike rousseau,2013-08-24 03:46:00,4661,I have to be honest... My anti reverse on an accudepth 17 malfunctioned tonight... First malfunction I've ever had with any of the 8-10 accudepths I've owned... This thread musta jinxed me.....  I didn't hesitate to pull the trigger on another accudepth to replace it tho....
804738,Moosebunk,2013-08-24 04:25:00,3970,"I like the Sealine's... and no issues of yet with the Accudepths.  Tekotas are great but I wouldn't outfit myself with a fleet of them... maybe just one for muskies and big arctic lakers.  The oldest I own is a Cabelas DepthMaster Gold.  These reels go on sale now and again, and I have to say the one I have has given no problems.  I thought Daiwa made them for Cabelas, but I could be wrong..?"
804740,Stoty,2013-08-24 06:24:00,2910,"Tekota's FOR SURE. Awesome reels! I fish Quinte a lot and have used Diawa's, Okuma's and Shimano's, with Shimano's being superior BY FAR.  The Diawa's/Okuma's freeze up during cold weather, so they're useless on Quinte in the Fall (when it counts).  I've been running Tekota's for a years now, and haven't had a single issue with them. I literally fish until the ice wont let me in early/late November, December and even January."
804753,kickingfrog,2013-08-24 13:07:00,8333,The plot has been lost. Apples are not oranges.
804760,mike rousseau,2013-08-24 14:46:00,4661,Fixed... Lol  And yes... The OP stated $100.... So talking about tekotas is a waste of time....
804860,dhickey,2013-08-25 01:44:00,1038,The 2nd question still hasn't been addressed .  Is the amount of bearings in a trolling reel worth consideration.?  Thanks. Don.
804862,mike rousseau,2013-08-25 02:08:00,4661,Because your not casting... I don't feel like it matters much...
803398,dhickey,2013-08-15 04:25:00,1038,I have a couple heavy bait casters that I don't use so I was thinking about putting a trolling reel on them.? (1 reel that I can switch if need be)  The rods are in very good shape and rated for 20 pound test so I could probably push them a little bit more.  I don't want to spend more than 100$ because I really don't troll all that much for  Musky. More for pike.  Any ideas.  Thanks.  Don.
803400,mike rousseau,2013-08-15 05:50:00,4661,Diawa accudepth... I have 6... Love em... Use em for walleye and musky... Size 17 for walleye and 27 for musky...  $70 I think
803404,fishindevil,2013-08-15 08:51:00,6254,Like mike says I have all my trolling reels with line counters on them and the accudepth from diiawa is great  for the price or the okuma line that way you can follow dive curve charts and be way more accurate for trolling and you can use it for multi species from pike to muskies and walleyes !!!!
803405,Handlebarz,2013-08-15 09:48:00,3790,I love the okuma convector 30D line counter for trolling musky. The 20's for pickerel
803409,fishindevil,2013-08-15 11:05:00,6254,"same here mike i have 6 of them i use for trout and salmon.....no issues with them at all,great reel for the money !!!"
803422,mattybculp,2013-08-15 13:18:00,388,  X3
803443,kickingfrog,2013-08-15 15:38:00,8333,"I have the base model diawas as well. No issues, but I don't use them for muskys or salmon."
803452,mike rousseau,2013-08-15 16:06:00,4661,I've been using the same accudepth 27 for musky for like 6-7 years without issues... Plenty of screamers with the drag tight...
803461,mercman,2013-08-15 16:45:00,7054,"Accudepth or Okuma. I prefer the Okuma for its shape. Its round shape makes it easier for me to ""palm"" it. I learned this past weekend, not to put my finger between the line guide and the side plate with a fish on!!! OUCCCHHH !!!!"
803463,mike rousseau,2013-08-15 17:13:00,4661,Yup... One small slip and that okuma broke...   Go diawa
803465,mercman,2013-08-15 17:37:00,7054, My little girlie hands fit the Okuma better. That's the only reason I like em.
803492,BillM,2013-08-15 20:57:00,17367,Diawas or some Okumas..  Cheap and do the job.
803521,Richie Razor,2013-08-16 00:44:00,536,Shimano Trinidad.... Spend more. Don't want to lose a weekly winner if the reel malfunctions..... I've seen it happen more than once....
803523,dhickey,2013-08-16 01:09:00,1038,Holly crap!!! Thinking the same. Im a Shimano fan. All rods and reels except for 1 Browning reel  and a couple Mitchells.
803537,Sinker,2013-08-16 02:51:00,8692,Tekota's are great reels too.  S.
803545,Old Ironmaker,2013-08-16 04:44:00,8243,"There's Okuma and second choice is Shimano, you just can't beat the Okuma for value."
803547,Sinker,2013-08-16 05:14:00,8692,"I have all 3 mentioned here. My preference is the takotas. You pay a bit more, but in my experience, have less issues.  S"
803559,BillM,2013-08-16 12:09:00,17367,"My oldman has been using the same Sealines 47H's since I was a little kid.   I still use them to this day, lol!   Love those things.   Don't know if the quality is the same between those late 70's/early 80's reels to what you'd get today, but those things have been bulletproof."
803565,Headhunter,2013-08-16 14:01:00,5703,"This^! The only advantage in my experience that Okuma has, is the large handle. It's easier to crank. I have to admit, that I am a Sealine bigot! I have not had a failure with my Diawa's and I have used them for Pickereyes and Lake O trolling. They are bullet proof. Maybe my Okuma experience is unique, but mine seem to realy dislike a lot of tension on a troll, ie planer boards. My anit-reverse has been hit or miss since the day I first used it. For an extra 20-30 bucks, you can get a Sealine and know that you have a reel that will last a life time. Just my 2 cents. HH"
803566,BillM,2013-08-16 14:10:00,17367,"I run Okuma Convectors on my dipsy setups...  No complaints with them either, but they haven't tied into even close to the amount of fish I've taken off riggers, lol.  I'm still running some old Fenwick custom fibreglass rods and a old Mitchell 782 Mooching reel as well!   Rods could use a re-wrap but they beat pool cues any day of the week."
803572,Raf,2013-08-16 15:24:00,3495,i'd be using the sealines if they made a lefty.. the convector is one of but a very few options for southpaws in this space.  sealines are a much better built reel.
803584,Dontcryformejanhrdina,2013-08-16 17:27:00,535,"I use the 30D too, never had a problem with it. Even when snagging standing logs going 7-8mph lol."
804561,dhickey,2013-08-23 03:10:00,1038,Thanks for all your input.(cheers) The convector and cold water are on the top of my list to check out. I also came across the Rapala Hydros 6 ball bearings and stainless steel main bearings.  So my question is are the # of bearings in a trolling reel as important as in a spinning reel ?(I wont even consider buying a spinning reel unless it has at least 8 bearings).  Hoping to get a couple hours away from work this week end to check them out.  Thanks. Don.
804571,BFSC Kevin,2013-08-23 04:58:00,1351,Rapala hydros
804642,bucktail,2013-08-23 18:44:00,1857,"Headhunter I agree with your assesment, I have 4 Diawa 17's and one the anti reverse died the first year. Tekotas are awesome but$$$$$$$$  darren"
