804413,Richie Razor,2013-08-22 04:18:00,536,Actually I know for a fact it was caught at the mouth of the credit in 1982
804435,craigdritchie,2013-08-22 12:12:00,1586,"Alex, I'll take ""Helped by Photoshop"" for $400"
804448,highdrifter,2013-08-22 13:53:00,2534,Jive turkeys... This guy's clearly from France.
804463,jbailey,2013-08-22 15:42:00,866," actually it was up the credit a bit, under the QEW"

804467,Richie Razor,2013-08-22 16:19:00,536,"Yeah the guy was fishin' for boots and hooked on to this mammoth on a single egg pattern, with a 4lb lead. Incredible really."
804472,BillM,2013-08-22 17:10:00,17367,I thought it was marshmellows?

804495,craigdritchie,2013-08-22 20:11:00,1586,Why can you clearly see shadows of the guy's legs ... but no shadow of the fish he's holding out in front of them?
804499,Roy,2013-08-22 20:23:00,13728,"Just a tactical illusion, Craig."
804553,redpearl99,2013-08-23 01:44:00,259,"hold on, are you saying this picture is fake?"
804581,RickOnt,2013-08-23 11:25:00,669,"AHHH ""The Attawapiskat"" mmmmmmmmm   Won't be long Doug   Sweet dreams"

804608,Dozer,2013-08-23 14:37:00,896,"The shadow of the fish is cast on his arm/leg - which ""fills"" the shadow of his legs on the ground?"
