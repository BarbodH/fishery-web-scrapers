It has a slight split at the ferrule, and I'm wondering how best to repair it. Was thinking of just pouring some Krazy Glue, Loctite, or any CA glue into it, but I thought I would look first for more experienced people to chime in. The split isn't bad enough right now that it prevents hauling in panfish, maybe even something bigger, but it would be nice to at least prevent it getting any larger. "
804838,NANUK,2013-08-24 23:14:00,797,Hard to suggest anything without looking at it but you could try putting a piece of heat shrink tube over it.
804885,Ralph Field,2013-08-25 13:47:00,1018,Wrap it using tying thread than varnish it.
804887,Dave Bailey,2013-08-25 14:06:00,1641,"Good suggestions, both. Might try all three; glue, thread, and cover it with heat shrink. Instead of buying fly-tying thread, would some 20lb test braided work? I've got plenty of that."
804899,Ralph Field,2013-08-25 16:25:00,1018,I used black furniture thread (very strong) so your 20 pound braid likely wouldn't be much thicker.
