804462,Lucky Linda,2013-08-22 15:39:00,93,http://www.mccollumsresort.com/aboutus.html  Has anyone got a 'special' spot to stay in Nipigon? I want a clean newer bed and lots of fish. A guide might be a good idea for a day or two as well.  http://hardcorefishing.org/Home_services.shtml#Special  Has anyone used this guide?  Thanks in advance!  linda

804717,danc,2013-08-24 00:50:00,4677,The Beaver Motel right on the hwy in Nipigon is a great place to stay. From there you have several access points to the river and the lake from 10 to 45 minutes away. It's a great place to explore.
804742,steelhead75,2013-08-24 07:28:00,35,"contact john valk at grindstone angling (905-689-0880) he will be able to put you in touch with an outfitter and lodging up there in nipigon. the name eludes me right now and john has trained all the guides up there in fly fishing as they knew the area but not fly fishing.    i met the owner on a steelhead river a few years ago and he told me the best time up there for big brookies is early to mid june FYI .    rooms were 75 bucks a night and the guides i think were 450-500 a day , he also rents boats by the day as well    http://www.grindstoneangling.com/    here is a great article on the nipigon river  http://www.theglobeandmail.com/partners/advexploreontario/giant-brookies/article11935826/"
804842,danc,2013-08-24 23:43:00,4677,  Depends on where and how you fish the fish system. My best time of the year starts right now.
