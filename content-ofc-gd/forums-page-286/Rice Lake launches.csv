803999,Jer,2013-08-20 11:52:00,1426,My buddy and I wanna give Rice Lake a try this week. We're looking for a ramp (and parking) on the north shore if possible.  My map book indicates a ramp at Hall's Landing. Does anybody know if this is accessible to the public? Is there parking available?

Basically go to the end of Hiawatha line and take a left and you'd drive right off the launch.  Another option is Campbelltown.  Ramp is technically on the Otonabee, but it would be about a 10 minute ride up to the lake."
