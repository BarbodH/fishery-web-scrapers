804851,bigcreekdad,2013-08-25 00:27:00,546,"S[pent the week at Crane's Lochaven Lodge with my twin sons, Norm and Jeff. Jeff has accompanied me every year at least on one trip, and often a second. Norm hadn't joined us in the last 8 years...as long as he's been in the US Army. Eight years, and three tours later, it was the three of us once again.  Fishing was, frankly, so -so. Monday thru Thursday, we had strong gusty winds and way too much sun. As Norm is a caster (ruined for life by catching a 46"" muskie at 14), and Jeff a worm dragger, the winds really limited our fishing spots. That being said, we caught some pike and bass, and one afternoon on a wacky worm I caught a 16, 17.5, and 18.5"" smallmouth on an very light spinning rod.  Two nights after dinner, I raised two muskie on a big surface plug. Neither fish I felt.....just smashing the lure, not eating it.  Our last day, Friday, we took a guide (tyler of of crane's....awesome guy!) as Jeff loves a shore lunch. We boated 6 eatable walleye by 11am, and the decided to pursue bigger fish the rest of the day. Our second spot raised an easy 50"" category fish on my surface plug....he was right behind it bit veered off a few feet from the boat. We tried several other lures and presentation to no avail. We left to have an excellent beer batter fried shore lunch, and returned for a few more shots at the fish, but no luck.  Overall, only an average fishing trip, but that's August for you. However, raising three muskie on surface plugs I feel is OK. Maybe next time. However, a trip with both boys (hell, they are 30 now) would have been great if we caught nothing.  Fortunately for me, I will return in three weeks for my annual solo trip. Maybe I'll nail one of those ""lookers"" then.  Finally, I can't say enough about Crane's. I consider Ed, Sue, Gracie and the staff to be damn near family. Also, this trip, as in most others I run into wonderful return guests I've met on prior trips."

Glad Tyler was able to find the Walleye for you, he struggled early in the year as this is his first year as a guide.  Sounds like wonderful time with the boys."
804895,Rich Clemens,2013-08-25 15:53:00,3131,Can't image what the excitement level would be to have a big girl crush a surface bait.   I know I loved it when I was doing some bass fishing (sorry Lew).
804905,Pigeontroller,2013-08-25 17:14:00,2793,"Sounds like a great  time with your boys! Keep throwing the topwaters, there's no better way to catch a Muskie!"
