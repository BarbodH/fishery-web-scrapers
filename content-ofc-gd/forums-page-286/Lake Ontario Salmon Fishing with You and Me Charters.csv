802929,Locnar,2013-08-12 22:34:00,645,"Yesterday was a beauty day to spend a day out fishing. 5:30am start, and the first fish in the boat was shortly after 6. All in all 16 fish landed, 19 missed/lost, making a total of 35 bites... holy hell! I wish every day of fishing was that eventful. Thanks to Lloyd for an excellent day of Salmon/Trout angling. If anyone is looking for a charter, give him a shout. Solid guy who knows how to find the fish. Here are some pictures for you to enjoy.       And now for the big catch of the day, my younger brother's 20lb Chinook. "

803073,captpierre,2013-08-13 16:30:00,2521,Nice!  But no bigger Kings.  We were out last night out of Bluffers and only caught 2   5 lbers in 4 hours.  The big ones must be staging
804554,fishhunter,2013-08-23 01:46:00,604,Sorry took so long to reply and say it was nice having you guys out. It was Good to meet some new guys fron the board. Working 7 days a week does not leave much time to be on here much these days. Fishing has been crazy this year with over 200 coho boated this year already. It's nice to have lots of coho to add to the mix of kings and bows.  Wayne yes still alive but Burt out lol 2 more weeks of salmon then its time to get boat ready for quinte walleye charters.
804564,fishnsled,2013-08-23 03:32:00,3520,Not sure how I missed this but always a great day on the water with Lloyd regardless of the fish.  Awesome day on the water and good to see that business is doing well Lloyd.
