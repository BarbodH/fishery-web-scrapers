804312,millerman,2013-08-21 17:48:00,29,hi every one im going to port maitland in a few days just wanted to know if any one knows of any good spots for channel cats and drum and possible walleye im only asking about walleye cause i have a few friends who say they catch them while shore fishing sometimes  thank you in advance   
804410,Freshtrax,2013-08-22 03:20:00,2215,"Off the end of the pier,  ya never know what you will catch.  I always did well where the pier meets the mainland as well"
804428,Rich,2013-08-22 10:40:00,3927,Yeah. There isn't too many spots to fish out that way besides the pier. Good news is: it's a pretty good spot.
804443,Fish4Eyes,2013-08-22 13:35:00,1022,"I caught a walleye at night 2' out from the rocks beside the pier. There are also cats, carp and drums around. See PM for more specific details."
804480,northernpike56,2013-08-22 18:01:00,717,"Only real spots are off the rocks before the pier, and then right on the pier. When you are on the pier, fish the grand river side rather than the lake. Ive not caught anything on the lake side"
804587,Fish4Eyes,2013-08-23 12:25:00,1022,I have usually concentrated on the area just before the transition from the steel wall to concrete wall and have done decent for the cats in particular.
