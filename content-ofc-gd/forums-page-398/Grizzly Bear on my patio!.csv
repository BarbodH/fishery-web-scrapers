704368,trophypikehunter,2012-06-10 14:23:00,89,"Silver Tipped Grizzly taken in Beaver Creek, Yukon.  Unfortunately the Bear wondered onto the porch of a cabin that contained 2 little girls a wife and a dude with a 44 magnum on his hip, hence no head on the Bear.  The Bear was 7.5 feet but is now just over 6ft.  National Geographic was in Alaska writing about the Alaskan Highway and heard about Rick so they did a story on him not 100% sure if the Bear is mentioned but I have the issue coming this week, November 1991 edition.. Rick passed away and willed to a friend who isn't the least bit interested in the outdoors so I offered to buy it as a house warming gift for my cousin who lives in Anne Lake, Yukon.  Tim thought it would be great to send the Bear back to the Yukon so he was more then happy to sell it to me, so this September I will be heading out to the Yukon for some Pike fishing and to mount this Bear on my cousin's wall..
