Also, there should be an access ""window"" that you can access on the downshaft so you can see if it's still connected to the bottom end. If it is all good going to the bottom end, you may have bigger problems."

Of course it happened to me when I was at the absolute furthest point away on the lake and it was just starting to get dark. Lots of paddling along the shoreline that night! Was only like $50 to repair so obviously its a pretty minor thing"
