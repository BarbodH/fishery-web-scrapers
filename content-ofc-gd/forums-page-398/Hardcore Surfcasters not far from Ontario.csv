704136,Ralph Field,2012-06-09 12:36:00,1018,"I cannot imagine trying to fish off those rocks at night. One slip or a big wave could cause you to loose your balance ,then if you hit your head on a rock you are toast."

704256,Sharkbait22,2012-06-09 22:09:00,297,Camera men have more sense? Can't film in the dark. I think that vid might have been part of a larger film.

704870,highdrifter,2012-06-11 23:55:00,2534,"Montauk...  at the height of the run..  is a sight to behold.  It's absolute mayhem.  The water boils with bunker and bass and blue fish, you're punching that cast to get it past the other dude, all the while getting pounded by the surf..  I've had the priviledge to fish it with FHR and it's as every bit as insane as this video portrays.   Heck, he probably fishes along side these guys!  Great video!  cheers HD"
