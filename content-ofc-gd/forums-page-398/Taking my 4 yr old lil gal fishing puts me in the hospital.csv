Better odds then the lottery or Lew smiling after catching a bass.   Thanks Wizard, I will admit it has been a couple years since the first incident, I think I may of been a little complacent... Not anymore, especially with the lil ones.  Good advice."
704704,adempsey,2012-06-11 18:00:00,1498, I am pretty sure that is incorrect.  If you have experienced a severe allergic reaction you are considered at risk for anaphylaxis.  Anyone at risk will have been prescribed an Epipen.  An anaphylactic reaction can happen at any time in subsequent reactions.  It's unpredictable as well as the severity of the reaction.

Never allergic before but she swelled up like crazy, luckily one of the people there was a nurse.  benidry fixed it but later had a doctors appt and he prescribed a pen.  Scary stuff. Glad your okay    Ian"
704855,crappieperchhunter,2012-06-11 22:59:00,2582,Looks like you will have to drag a canoe in there from now on Phil to stay away from the Ants.  It sucks when a handy fishing spot gets scratched off the list
704895,aplumma,2012-06-12 00:51:00,6896,Fire ants brings back memories of growing up down South. Them buggers are all over the place and I had to jump into the water trough a few times to get the off me.   Art

490443,lew,2010-08-02 12:19:00,12766," I woke up one morning about a month ago with a dime sized welt on my arm and dead center was what I assumed was a bite mark. Even now though I still have the welt and the ""bite mark"" is still visible.  I figured it was maybe a spider bite but who knows, perhaps it was an ant  Good to hear your feeling better Phil, that must been scary."
490471,Headhunter,2010-08-02 14:51:00,5703,"Wow Plil, scarey stuff and very glad your ok... I was taking a walk long the Lake O shoreline last year with my wife and kids. Close to home down near Rouge Beach. I spooted what looked like a big cluster of Rasberrys so thought I'd wade into the brush to grab a few for my daughter, she loves them. Not 30 seconds after getting in there, I started to feel like I was being stung, multiple times. Seems the fire ants we ""protecting"" these bushes. I got covered in bites, a none to appealing feeling I'll tell yah! After getting them off of me, we rushed home for me to have a shower and that finally took the stinging away. Luckily, I did'nt suffer a reation, but it was definately not something I have the will to repeat! HH"
490623,Photoz,2010-08-02 21:04:00,792,"I had a similar experience down along Bowmanville Creek 3 years ago . . .    I was fishin' over near the boat ramp and it felt just like somebody had put a lit cigarette on my ankle. I hauled my pants-leg up just as I got nailed on the other shin!!  I saw about a half dozen teeny l'il red ants (2  -  3 mm) on my shoe, knocked them off then beat a fast retreat outta there to my van where I had a can of 'OFF' which I used to spray up my pant legs socks & shoes. I ended up with 7 bites, every one burned like hell for hours after! And swelled up like a marble, you could actually see some of the bumps through my sock! I'm not one to ever ask about someone elses 'honey hole' but in a case like this, wouldn't you think this might keep someone else like yourself outta there if you would be so kind as to divulge where to stay away from? I doubt there will be anybody making a run for your spot if you  tell us where these potentially deadly little vermin reside?  P. S. Lew . . .   .  Punch in 'LYME DISEASE' and look at the description & illustrations they have for Lyme Disease, then decide if it's worth getting checked out. There are dosens of sites there, but Wikipedia is the simplest and a good place to start. I saw an article on W-5 last year . . .     Lyme disease is VERY scarey![/size]  Photoz"
490645,Harrison,2010-08-02 22:17:00,2202,"Exactly Photoz, those are the same buggers and in the same general area as well.  I would absolutely tell folks where this is if it was a spot anyone would know. I have never seen anyone there. If I thought someone here might know of it I would post it."
490689,crappieperchhunter,2010-08-03 00:05:00,2582,Holy Crap Phil. That doesn't sound like much fun to me.  Happy though that the little one did not suffer the same fate as her old man.  Wish you the best at getting through it and sorting out the cause.  I hope the bite was at least worthwhile

In hindsight, we should of left right away.  I've never seen the ants there before.  If they stung my lil one it would of ripped me apart.  I doubt I'll go back there with her now as I remember walking out and one getting me above the knee so I assume they are not only on the ground."

We found a spot off the road to the water plant , first cast son gets a nice bass , so we set up there and we had probably had the best day of bass and bowfins we have ever had on the island , lots of fish and the bowfins fought like mad. So with the fishing good I did not have the heart to tell my son we got to get out of here , these ants are eating me alive ,doused in deet they still were eating me . When the bite died dowm(the fishing bite the ants never stopped) I told my son time to go , on the boat home I started to feel like you said very week and could not catch my breath . When we got to city side I found I could not drive my car as my vision was blurred and I was haveing a hard time breathing . made it to the hospital at queen and I think church and went into emerg . where I collasped on floor just inside doors . I was checked for allerges after but the docs said the poison from these ants even if you are not allerget can do this to you . Glad you are ok , this from someone who knows first hand what these guys can do ."

Even decked out in chest waders, wading jacket, bug spray, they still find their way onto and into just about everything.  I used to fish one stream in your neck of the woods for carp )and occasionally for smallies) during summer but haven’t been back because of the ants.  Even wading in the water doesn’t seem to help much…They swim!"

Wasn't feeling to bad yesterday(at home resting), but today I am not feeling so good.  Have an Appt. tomorrow morning with my GP.

Far enough away from the spot I was when I got bit earlier in this thread.  Well, it looks like fire ants have invaded the whole shoreline of Lake O - in Bowmanville any ways.  I put my pack down to tie my shoe and it must of crawled on my pack and bit me in the arm.  Off to the emerg again, it is confirmed I do have a reaction to the stings.  And i was told many people do and most have no idea until it happens (like me).  You will know when you get stung/bit by them, it feel like a hot needle burning your skin.  That's it, Bowmanville shoreline is totally off limits for me in summer.  Just a heads up if you fish the area."

Dont know if there is something to do with commerants , but I was attacked when out on the spit for a walk with the wife , I walked into an area that had dead trees loaded with cormerants nests and mounds of bird dropping all around . Started takeing pics of the damage and I noticed ant hills in the cormant poo . Thought wow must be some kind of tough ant that could make  a home when all else was dead . Like you said the stings burn like  hell and than I swelled up like a beached whale . The spit is out of bounds for me now , never going back , thanks for the heads up in Bowmanville wont be doing any hiking there allso ....  .."

704679,whiskywizard,2012-06-11 17:19:00,305,"I see that this is an old thread - revived....  Just wanted to mention that allergens in general, and stings/bites in particular can sensitize you. In other words, each subsequent exposure will cause a more severe anaphylactic reaction. In many people, repeat exposure can lead to anaphylaxis and death. Maybe not the first or second time, but ...  Be careful Phil, and be aware that your kids may have inherited your allergy."
490272,Harrison,2010-08-01 13:37:00,2202,"I have a little gem spot off Lake O for some perch and crappies off shore. Its perfect for the lil one. While we were there I must of got bit 6 or so times by these ants. Thought nothing of it as I've been bit by all kinds bugs, bees, flies etc. Well when I got home I started feeling weak, took off my shirt and my misses freaked. I had hives the size of softballs all over me.  Within a few minutes I went totally flush and bright red all over. I drove to the hospital and was waiting to be checked in and my chest tightened.  I started pouring sweat and nearly passed out but a paramedic saw me and put me in chair. They rushed me right in, hooked me up and pumped me full of stuff. They said I just made it in time. Has anyone one here had something like this before?  Not sure if its an allergy or as they put it ""the poison"" that caused it. Thankfully my little one had rubber boots on.  Anyone else have this before? Phil"
490274,Roy,2010-08-01 13:41:00,13728,GEEEEEEEZ Phil...scary stuff for sure. Did anyone at the hospital mention you keeping an epipen on you?
490275,Harrison,2010-08-01 13:44:00,2202,"No they didn't Roy. This was just last night. Never was allergic to anything before. I best get checked again. If I am not wrong, I believe allergies can start as you age.  They made me think it was the ants themselves though."
490278,Governator,2010-08-01 13:59:00,879,"I've never heard of ant that could cause that much swelling.  It sounds like an allergic reaction to the venom, probably fire ants.  Were they red in colour?"

490282,lew,2010-08-01 14:11:00,12766,"Hope the docs figure out what caused it so you can be ready for it the next time Phil.  Like you, I'm not alergic to anything that I know of either so something like that would really give you a scare for sure."
490284,Harrison,2010-08-01 14:17:00,2202," Ya, I would like to get in and find out what the deal is.  I got out of the hospital early this morning, so I am still freaking abit.  Shame, becasue if it is an allergy I am nervous to head back there.  I spend alot of time in the bush, thankful I found out 10 mins from home and not way back in the bush somewhere."
490299,Guest Johnny Bass,2010-08-01 15:28:00,0,Glad your ok! I would not take my kids anywhere near that spot again! These allergies can be hereditary!

Get tested to see what is going on so you can be prepared should it happen again.  If you can't get back to your honey hole for medical reasons, just pm me the spot and I'll gladly check on it from time to time for ya.     In all seriousness, I'm very glad to hear you are OK.  Your kids need you around for many more fishing trips.  Take care of yourself Phil."
490312,Harrison,2010-08-01 16:02:00,2202,"Thanks guys, after calming down a little I've done alittle research. Definitely an allergy from what I gather. Very lucky it really hit me while walking into emerg.  I had no idea, that's the freakiest part.  Thank goodness I listened to the misses and went to the hospital, she was right (for once lol)  Wil, PM me."
490313,bigugli,2010-08-01 16:06:00,6138,"Reactions to bug bites can turn right nasty. Not too unusual these days. It would seem that our resistance to commonplace nuisances is diminishing. I've seen the fire ant reaction before. I've also seen big rashes and welts develop from mosquito, blackfly and deerfly bites. Get used to the idea of carrying an epipen."
490314,chessy,2010-08-01 16:10:00,610,you are correct . you can be stung by bees and show no alergic reaction unless you are stung by a bee that has been collecting  golden rod and you are allergic to golden rod and they put the stuff right in your system . so you may not be alergic to the aints just watever they were feeding or carrying at the time of bite ..  good luck .
490323,Spiel,2010-08-01 17:30:00,9065,"Wow that is nasty Phil, I'm glad you're okay, truly!     But what I've quoted scares me. Honestly in the best interest of your health and your families well being along with all the others on the road you should really have had someone drive you to the hospital. Not preaching just (concerned) considering how you nearly passed out at the hospital it's fortunate that you made it there, safely. In hindsight I'm sure you can see how it could have become tragic.  Again I'm glad you're okay."

490335,Harrison,2010-08-01 18:27:00,2202,"Absolutely Spiel, I agree 100 percent about driving, but I really had no idea what was going on, or what was going to happen. I was very lucky that the full force hit when I was there because it happened in the blink of an eye.   Now I know and count my blessings I didn't hurt anyone else. Thank you for the well wishes everyone.  Maybe we should all have an epipen with us just incase."
490338,Guest LivingLegend,2010-08-01 18:34:00,0,"Is the epipen what the Doctors told you to do for now on, incase you get bit by these ants again? I seem to attract the posion ivy but never take a reaction to bug bites, maybe in time. Good to know ur little one wasnt affected, take it esay......"
490353,Bill Shearer,2010-08-01 20:38:00,456,"With Fire Ants making inroads in Ontario, we are all susceptible, as no Ontario born folks have developed antibodies to their venom. I worked for a couple of months in the Cayman Islands, and although I had a bad reaction to their bites, nothing like you encountered. The welts from their sting lasted for months! Epipen or at least heavy duty Benedryl would be a good thing to carry."

490437,Harrison,2010-08-02 11:57:00,2202,"Thanks all for the kind words.  Feeling better today.  Left a message with my GP to get in and see a specialist.  It's amazing how fast it happened.  The timeline from bites to shock was approx. 40 mins.  - I've never had allergies - Been bitten tons of times with no issues. - I'm heathly and fit - I've spent thousands of hours in the outdoors.  Then a few ant bites/stings and it became very serious - quickly.  I know at work it is mandatory to have Epipens at some locations.  I'll tell you now, with this happening to me I will have some always around for my family.  Thanks again for your kind words, and yes Jewelbee, she's not just a pretty face. Phil"
