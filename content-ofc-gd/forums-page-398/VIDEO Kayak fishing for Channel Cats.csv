We've put together some of the Channel Catfish footage for starters in the link below. In the next day or two we'll also be posting a timelapse sequence of a dragonfly emerging and some good underwater footage of a snapping turtle who visited daily - both of which were pretty cool to watch. One bonus of an Algonquin adventure in the Spring is that if the fishing is slow there is always something else going on around you. Many moose and eagle sightings - bald and golden, the snakes, bullfrogs and turtles are out and active and the miniature world of insects and spiders is coming to life.  And, of course, at 4:30 every morning a trio of Whippoorwills would start their repetitive calling until sunrise - probably to remind us to take them off the endangered list .....  More footage will follow shortly.  "
