703338,Dave Bailey,2012-06-06 16:37:00,1641,Anyone ever try this before?  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3G8XGFTxFDE
703340,BillM,2012-06-06 16:42:00,17367,"No, and never will, lol."
703343,bushart,2012-06-06 16:45:00,2628,Cool...Wonder how man times he had to change the shorts after a gator grabbed it
703347,Dave Bailey,2012-06-06 17:06:00,1641,"Pretty sure that I did something like that when I was a kid, probably most of us have, just playing around. Don't remember having success, but I might try it again when the opportunity arises."
703385,Christopheraaron,2012-06-06 19:52:00,3525,"Never tried it, but it looks a bit boring after you get a fish on, not much of a fight when you don't have any line out."
703394,dnb_cbr,2012-06-06 20:06:00,61,"Up at a popular fly in lodge, I usually have some success and a lot of fun trolling buzz-baits with just a few yards of line out, right beside the boat. I don't waste a lot of time on this, and haven't caught anything huge, but watching them strike a buzz-bait right beside you is an amazing sight!  BTW...Leaving for our 2012 trip next weds!"
703397,johnnyb,2012-06-06 20:17:00,3413,"I like the bit about going back and forth on a spot, almost like figure-eighting a musky.....but I don't see how this is really that effective.  He missed all kinds of areas that he should've been casting tight to shore. Most I would take from it is zigzagging the bait a few times at boatside, when you're right up against the weeds. Otherwise....I'll let the wife do the sweeping and I'll catch the fish"
703409,jedimaster,2012-06-06 20:53:00,3472,Saw that one a couple years back.
703418,misfish,2012-06-06 21:25:00,29133,  And it didnt catch on?
703461,krixxer,2012-06-06 23:45:00,274,"that looks like sweeping, I'm not crazy about housework"
703505,Stoty,2012-06-07 03:47:00,2910,"I love the sweet ""pump you up"" text slides!  ""And now more ACTION""....  I'll throw my Nitro and a Horny Toad up against his ""sweeping"" any day of the week, LOL."
703526,Broker,2012-06-07 11:12:00,482,Looks like a boring way to fish to me LOL
703527,lew,2012-06-07 11:18:00,12766,A good technique for those who are too lazy to cast & crank
704205,Rich,2012-06-09 16:35:00,3927,I have a technique called 'orbing'.  Hook on a red/white spherical bobber and pop it. Probably equally as effective - and silly looking.
704315,pike slayer,2012-06-10 03:30:00,1177,not a bad idea when your buddy is trying to get his snag and u have nothing better to do.
704439,Ben_Daniels,2012-06-10 20:12:00,435,"You can actually get bobbers with a concaved head that are specifically made for popping, a lot of saltwater guys use them for redfish and sea trout with a shrimp or other bait. Might be something to look into!"
704570,Jacob,2012-06-11 11:54:00,186,Interesting? Yes Will i wver try it? NO It looks like it might work but you are actually missing a lot more water.
704577,Harrison,2012-06-11 12:10:00,2202,May work on a private pond.
