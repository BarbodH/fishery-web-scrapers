704753,DMASSE,2012-06-11 19:16:00,420,"Hello All  I am extending another invite to see if anyone would like to go fishing,  I live in Oshawa and love to fly fish my private land for resident browns, brookies and the odd stranded steelie left in the system.  |Fishing for the past week has been good with a good number of browns in the 14-17 in mark caught...  If fly fishing isnt your thing, I also have two Kayaks that we could take out on a local lake, like scugog or frenchmans for pike walleye, or  panfish...  Also I love fishing the kawatha dam systems for nice walleyes,  it a great day to spend casting or flyfishing for walleyes..   anyway feel free to call the house (289)250-6313  or pm me  Dave"

704811,misfish,2012-06-11 21:22:00,29133," Very generous of you Dave. I would love a day fishing a fly for browns with you. Me thinks though,you and I had a conflict on a report, and not sure if you would be willing to fish with me   . Maybe it just the way the words flow here. I would really like to fish with someone of your knowledge. The kayak thing sounds cool. Maybe in the fall,we can launch on the notty and get aquinted. I can even get down your way.  Brian"

I find the whirring of the diesel motor very relaxing as you dig the hole for the festive event.  Good on you I would take the chance and ""fish"" with you but you are a little far.   Art"
