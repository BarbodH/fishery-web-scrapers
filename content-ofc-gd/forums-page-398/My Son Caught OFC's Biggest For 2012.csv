704795,bushart,2012-06-11 20:46:00,2628,Well I've been fishin 45 years--and never have caught anything like that yet  I told him he may have peaked at that one---freshwater wise
704801,Ralph Field,2012-06-11 20:56:00,1018,"You are correct, your son will not be able to match that catch during his fishing life time. Congratulations!"
704823,mike rousseau,2012-06-11 21:45:00,4661,Nice catch... Musts been an epic battle...  I'm glad in YOUR thread you weren't completely reamed for posting about OOS sturgeon...
704841,bushart,2012-06-11 22:34:00,2628,  Yeah I know---Yes it was an epic battle and old dad was coachin all the way  He caught it Saturday and I was'nt gonna tell anyone outside my friends and family---but this was a fish of a lifetime---and I likely won't see another
704857,manitoubass2,2012-06-11 23:05:00,11391,"Bushart,  I live right beside a river full of sturgeon. I've spoke with the MNR various times over the past years in regards to sturgeon. So far it's unanimous that they have no issues with pics taken of incidental catches, but strongly prefer the fish to remain in the water (like you did). Sometimes I see them visit other boats and ask if they had incidentals and if measurements were taken. I just take that as the anglers and CO's caring and hoping to see them flourish and be healthy  These fish are true beasts. I've never targeted them, but I've had 3 incidentals over the years. Two were just pups but the last one was a 7ft beast that took well over an hour to see. It's an amazing experience for sure.  Kudos to your son for the catch of a lifetime! That musta been a real thrill for him and you as well! I can tell your one proud papa!!!  Kudos to the other board members as well for being respectfull and letting Bushart share his angling/parenting enthusiasm"
704862,bushart,2012-06-11 23:26:00,2628,Right on Manitou  A 7 footer is a mastadon---could'nt imagine  I do give these fish full marks for bulldoggin down
704889,manitoubass2,2012-06-12 00:37:00,11391," Yep, they will do that, or if they so choose, will just sit on bottom and there is nothing, absolutely nothing you can do. Well you can wait, lol, thats your only option.  My big one was on a 6'6"" medium heavy rod with 8lb mono. I could quite literally feel the reel seat slowly splitting apart. I couldn't believe I was able to actually get that fish in on 8lb mono, it took alot of manuevering and I think I learned more about fighting a fish, that one time, in all my other years as an angler.  and to anyone that wonders whether the fish is fine or not (as per the roll in the pic), these fish actually act as if they haven't even been caught. They are like no other freshwater fish in those terms. Even when you release them and they are just floating there, they aren't usually hurt/tired, they just CHOOSE to do so. In our watershed/sturgeon program, these fish when caught for mating at the farm, go sometimes up to an hour out of the water. And even then, they revive as if nothing ever happened.  So I highly highly doubt this fish was harmed in anyway. And appears to be handled with utmost respect, as I would give the benefit of the doubt to bushart/Son as we all know he's a responsible angler/human being, as well as a great member of OFC   "
704890,Christopheraaron,2012-06-12 00:38:00,3525,"Nice fish! No complaints here, it would be pretty awesome to target them in BC."
704894,Twocoda,2012-06-12 00:49:00,4130,I can remember the one and ONLY sturgeon i have caught in my life like it was yesterday ...its a long story but heres the short....1983 South Saskatchewan river within Regina city limits 49 inches 10# test one mangled fishing net and almost one completely severed finger....  Congrates to your son Terrence...incidental or not ...its a fish of a lifetime if you dont live near them
704900,woodenboater,2012-06-12 00:57:00,2277," Man, now I want to hear the long version !!  and yup, Terence musta been pumped to have landed that beast and props all around for taking care of this beauty !"
704915,pikeguy,2012-06-12 01:51:00,195,Ya tough they are came across some on nippising. The c/o that i know gave me heck the last time i cough one. Not because i cough one but because i did not look to see if it was tagged and record its girth and length but he did want to know were i cough it and on what.
704918,tb4me,2012-06-12 02:03:00,3295,Wow what a beast of a fish..Ive seen sharks smaller then that beast..
704920,bushart,2012-06-12 02:07:00,2628,Thanks Guys  I've caught lots in my day---but the torch has passed and he did better than I would have  So I guess my job is done
705021,Headhunter,2012-06-12 13:08:00,5703,SWEET!!!! Thanks for posting the pic... HH
705024,jigsnreels,2012-06-12 13:12:00,133,"Amazing pic.  A once in a lifetime encounter - sadly.  Thanks for sharing the photo, and for you and your son's respectful treatment of one of those very few remaining freshwater giants..."
705029,ccmtcanada,2012-06-12 13:23:00,7971,I have been following this thread and hoping you'd post a picture of the beast!!  All I can say is congrats all around for that once in a lifetime fish!
705032,bushart,2012-06-12 13:31:00,2628,I hear ya guys-----I'm thinkin of everyone that wrote here on this thread---there's likely a thousand years fishin experience  and consensus is----once in a lifetime---that's what I told my son
705042,grimsbylander,2012-06-12 13:50:00,3016,"Hey that's amazing!! He'll remember that fish forever! Small world btw, I received those sturgeon pics yesterday from one of my suppliers!"
705049,bushart,2012-06-12 14:10:00,2628,  Ya lost me----he showed you my pic?  Only place I sent it was family and friends and posted here  Tell your supplier----Daiwa rod (mh)---Quantum spinning reel (go figure?) and 6lb dia spiderwire easy cast braid  Tell him to stock lots cause they git er dun
705057,grimsbylander,2012-06-12 14:45:00,3016,  pm sent.
705170,GreenCanada,2012-06-12 19:56:00,375,"Wow, what a story! I was out West last year with my brother and he happened to hook into a sturgeon in the Columbia River while fishing for pickerel. I started the video and all you can see is ""ssss sss sss, snap"" as the line peeled out and then snapped. It was a thrill of a lifetime and now he is considering targeting one in the Sask River I believe, where it is catch and release.  As far as I am concerned, if I am following the regulations and therefore abiding by the law I could care less if someone wants to harass or bully me for not following ""their"" particular viewpoint. I don't go out of my way to catch out of season fish, but if I happen to catch a monster while fishing for something else I will most likely take a photo, so long as it does not jeopardize the fish in question.  Bully's will be bully's!  Don't let them ruin the sharing of your amazing fishing experience"
704687,bushart,2012-06-11 17:45:00,2628,Well Maybe---and I can't show you cause the rules  While out fishin willys on the wkd---he nailed a dinosaur  Would'nt have mentioned cause the rules cept it's size  40 minute fight----65 inch Sturgeon---on a jig with 20 lb braid (6lb dia)  Did a rough girth at approx 40 inches---all the websites put it around 130 lbs  My buddy who'se fished em all his life says 60 inches is 100lbs on average  Got a pic of it beside the boat----never seen anything like it---happily swam away after being unhooked  Did a back flip like Free Willy  And at 40 minutes---that was all he could do to get it near the boat---did'nt see it for 15 min.  Anyway we all get untargeted out of seasoners----but not like this too often---that's why I brought it up---was'nt gonna for a while.
704689,BillM,2012-06-11 17:49:00,17367,I don't think too many people would complain about seeing a monster like that!!!
704694,bushart,2012-06-11 17:51:00,2628,I know Bill but I recall our guide from eastern On (St Larry) gettin worked over for postin a sturg  Even though this guy stayed in the drink
704697,johnnyb,2012-06-11 17:54:00,3413,Sounds amazing....certainly a day you won't forget.  I know *I* wouldn't complain if I were to feast my eyes upon this beast.  OR.....just come up with a few paintings for us....no rule against that!
704699,mercman,2012-06-11 17:55:00,7054,Smart move not posting a pic:good: i hate seeing people shredded in a public forum.  Musta scared the beejeepers out of him when he got a look at the fish !!! Congrats.
704701,bushart,2012-06-11 17:56:00,2628,My boy is 25 and in real good shape---he was tired after that though
704703,bushart,2012-06-11 17:58:00,2628,Mercky---he did 8 laps around the boat (not all at once)  Circled like a shark----also pulled the boat backwards----(Smokercraft pro Tiller)
704706,BillM,2012-06-11 18:03:00,17367,"If you've got the pic hosted on a public site (Photobucket, Flickr, etc) I'd love to see it."
704709,Skipper D,2012-06-11 18:06:00,1970,"I knew this morning this thread was coming , i dream't about that fish last night ........ , congrats congrats .. l"
704710,mercman,2012-06-11 18:07:00,7054,  :rofl2:  JUST WHEN YOU THOUGHT IT WAS SAFE TO GO BACK IN THE WATER:w00t:
704711,bushart,2012-06-11 18:07:00,2628,Bill can I send you a pm with the pic??  I'll try  I don't see a way to attach??  I'll figure somethin out
704728,Gregoire,2012-06-11 18:30:00,1397,"That sounds like a heck of an experience. I echo the sentiment that posting a pic would not be a great idea, and am happy to hear that it was a water release. Maybe someday there will at least be a catch and release open season for these mammoths."
704739,lew,2012-06-11 18:50:00,12766," I doubt  even a CO would give you a problem with taking a picture of a fish in the water while your removing the hooks, or even a pic of you measuring the girth while reviving that brute.  Let's have a boo at the beast"
704745,jigsnreels,2012-06-11 19:10:00,133,"  x2 - what are you going to do?  I think it's been acknowledged that you weren't specifically looking for one (your gear proves it), and you took care to release it as respectfully as possible, by leaving it in the water and not hauling it out for some chest-puffing trophy pics.  An experience like the one you had is an extremely rare occurence, so I certainly wouldn't scold you for posting a pic..."
704749,misfish,2012-06-11 19:13:00,29133,"Yep,go for it Terrance.I see no issues.Like you said,in the drink and released properly.  Good on you and yer son."
704755,Roy,2012-06-11 19:19:00,13728,"Bushart, the way it works is this. As the rules state, we 'prefer' that people not post pics of out of season, angled fish. There's nothing stopping you from posting it but if the thread loses civility we will have to lock or delete it. Also, as most have already stated, it depends on the circumstances. Yours, to me, sound very legitimate. It's your call."
704756,bushart,2012-06-11 19:19:00,2628,OK Boys---I'll be lookin for yur support when I get turfed  Now it is coincidence this fish is on it's side---it did a couple rolls near the surface  I was kinda excited and on a bright day have a little difficulty seeing thru my viewfinder on my digital camera  This fish was lots lively on release  
704757,davey buoy,2012-06-11 19:19:00,5505,"I can't believe you would be dragged across the coals when you caught a fish out of season,removing hook,in the water,can't show a picture. With the gear for a lot smaller fish.What has happened that we can't show a picture under these circumstances.I would love to see a picture of this beautiful beast!!.jmo."
704761,johnnyb,2012-06-11 19:23:00,3413,"Gorgeous fish....congrats to you and your son, and kudos for making sure it swam away strong"
704763,bushart,2012-06-11 19:27:00,2628,We hung around for like half an hour to make sure it did'nt come to surface in difficulty  like I said when the hook got popped--it backflipped like a rocket  My buddy said they're quite tough
704765,davey buoy,2012-06-11 19:35:00,5505," Thanks for the picture,I'm sure he was fine."
704776,Leecher,2012-06-11 20:15:00,7832,I was waiting anxiously for you to post the pic of the behemoth.... Wow man... WHAT A BEAST   Congrats to your son for live releasing it
704777,bushart,2012-06-11 20:20:00,2628,Thanks Jacques---had to release it  This lake has big lakers as well---for a while we were wonderin if it was one of them
704785,Broker,2012-06-11 20:35:00,482,Wow i can only imangine hooking into that monster!
704792,Rod Caster,2012-06-11 20:42:00,5784,Nice catch. That's the kind of battle you don't soon forget!
