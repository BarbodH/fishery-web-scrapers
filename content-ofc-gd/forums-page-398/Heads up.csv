705128,Snidley,2012-06-12 17:58:00,620,Be carefull to check out the shipping costs to Canada on that site as they can be expensive. They do have terrific specials especially in the off season though.
705138,johnnyb,2012-06-12 18:13:00,3413,"ORdered up a few lures...split the shipping bill with a friend....not too bad.  Could have shipped it to relatives in the States for less....but after splitting the cost, it was only a few bucks more to have it delivered to my door Now if only I had stuck to just buying a couple LT craws....  "
705160,asdve23rveavwa,2012-06-12 19:20:00,2690,  Not as bad as they used to be...lures and a reel cost me $10 to ship.
