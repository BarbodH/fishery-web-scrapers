I've been trying to elaborate on a pattern my brother and I have going and today the pattern busted wide open...  We were trolling cranks on underwater cliff edges and major points or saddles that divert large amounts of water...  We started fishing around 1130am and didn't get hit till around 1230pm... Then we got 9 in the next 4 hours...  Then we headed home for some fresh walleye and fries... But as soon as the plates were empty... Back out we went...  Fished from 630pm till 830pm landing another 6 walleyes...  The part I haven't let you in on was the best part of the day...    They were BIG today...  Our top 5 were 29"" 28"" 26"" 25"" 25""   Heres the 2 bigguns... Sorry for the bad picks... Camera phone...     "

704362,mercman,2012-06-10 14:04:00,7054,"Man Mike !!! Those are some real TOADS !!!!! Gotta love Fishing with little Zack !!!! He makes that walleye look 40"" long !!!!"
704520,Rod Caster,2012-06-11 02:28:00,5784,"Are you exporting the filets to Independent grocers? I saw filets on ice today that were just massive, made me think of you guys slaying the big girls!  Again, makes my catches look bite size haha"
704558,mike rousseau,2012-06-11 11:09:00,4661, On the same note... We weren't sure if we were gunna get anything small enough for supper... I like walleye around 2 pounds for eating...
704564,Rod Caster,2012-06-11 11:39:00,5784,"I hear you, on Nipissing an ""eater"" is 30-40cm. Not big by any means, but they taste so much better than any 5 pound oldie goldie."
