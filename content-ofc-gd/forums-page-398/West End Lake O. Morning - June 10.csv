704392,icefisherman,2012-06-10 17:23:00,952,"Started at first light finished at Noon... first fish a small shaker King....kept moving out...found the perfect down temp (47-48 degrees down 55 feet) and the show began....5 triple headers...3 double headers...final score was 17/32...most Cohos but much larger ones vs. last few trips...some big Kings screamers(in the high teens and twenties) and 4-5 big bows in the mix as well...almost no wind...perfect weather...catch ratio wasn't perfect but we were having a bit of training session on board for some of the teammates today  Nevertheless everyone were happy and smiles year to year...several total chaos situations as you can imagine with so many triples...everything was firing...8 colors leadcore...2 riggers (50-60 down), and 3 dipsies (2 power pro and one wire with flies)....green, blue, yellow spoons... watermelon...all were performing great....  the only bad part was some equipment damage....lost two A-Tom-Mik flies (both got the fly line broken even though I was checking it regularly)....and lost my Chrome 15# Shark.... :'( :-\ :-[  So a pricey trip but well worth it action wise....we stayed in 250-270 fow.          Cheers, Ice Fisherman"

704461,SlowPoke,2012-06-10 21:49:00,2984,"Just another day at the office for you.... I know when I'm out there tomorrow I'll be hearing ""You should have been here yesterday!!!!"""
704466,BillM,2012-06-10 22:17:00,17367,"I lost a chrome shark a few weeks ago, what a piss off that was!  LOL!   Good job man!  Looks like the big lake is definitely heating up."
704600,icefisherman,2012-06-11 13:34:00,952," hahaha Brian we've left some for you ;-)  Cheers, Ice Fisherman"
704614,Leecher,2012-06-11 14:17:00,7832,Awesome Emil    Sorry to hear about the lost of equipment    Sounds like you all had a super time
704622,bucktail,2012-06-11 14:49:00,1857,"Awesome trip other then losing that ball, ouch!  Having numbers of cohos back is great, anyone who has spent a day of double and triple headers of coho will reasses there love of chinooks!    Cohos have a definate spot in the lake ontario stocking... simply too much fun!"
704648,Fisherman,2012-06-11 16:14:00,7201,"Coho..  , that fish he's holding in the second picture has spots on the lower half of its tail, therefore it's a __________."
704726,Spiel,2012-06-11 18:25:00,9065," I must have missed the remark stating that the picture was of a Coho.  Good day on the water Emil, I feel your pain though on the loss of the chrome shark, costly for sure."
704738,Fisherman,2012-06-11 18:50:00,7201," Ah point taken, made a bad assumption that the picture would have been related to the comment."
704741,Spiel,2012-06-11 18:52:00,9065, 
704744,misfish,2012-06-11 19:08:00,29133,Your smoken out there Emil. Nicely done.
704863,icefisherman,2012-06-11 23:30:00,952,"Thanks guys. Yeah didn't take pictures of the cohos only of the bigger kings.  Cheers, Ice Fisherman"
