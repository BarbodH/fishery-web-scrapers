704488,Terry,2012-06-10 23:57:00,14456,"so the plan was to try to get some pike on video off to cooks bay and try to find a place to launch on the west side  launched and off I went to a pike spot  4 casts and I had 2 small pike, so I set up the gopro underwater camera ...not a pike to be found anywhere  but I did find a lot of perch and a bunch of catfish/bullheads. whatever they are and some of the ugliest fish I have ever seen one catfish too a bite t the camera..a set of lips that would...ah..never mind  got hot fast and I called it a day  but had lots of fun watching fish swim around  <iframe width=""560"" height=""315"" src=""http://www.youtube.com/embed/bINjJMLBbGI"" frameborder=""0"" allowfullscreen></iframe>       <iframe width=""560"" height=""315"" src=""http://www.youtube.com/embed/IBfESY9cqc4"" frameborder=""0"" allowfullscreen></iframe>"
704489,danc,2012-06-11 00:03:00,4677,Cool vid Terry. I have to admit that I'm intrigued by these go pros.
704490,davey buoy,2012-06-11 00:04:00,5505,"Great video,very clear and I see there is no shortage of fish. Good to see that.!!"
704491,glen,2012-06-11 00:05:00,2641,Nice vid.  Its funny to see the cats in there with the perch and weeds.
704494,Terry,2012-06-11 00:07:00,14456,"they are good but ou have to remember, if you can't see the camera in the water you don't know where it it pointed  I however mounted mine on my old underwater camera/monitor with 80 feet of cable so I see where I am pointing with the old camera and monitor and the Gopro is recording in the water"
704498,Handlebarz,2012-06-11 00:32:00,3790,Great idea terry to put it on a fish tv I might have to try it

704778,Leecher,2012-06-11 20:24:00,7832,"Nice video Terry     How come you don't have background music playing?  With that type of footage, I'd thrown in this  "
704793,Terry,2012-06-11 20:43:00,14456,youtube has been giving me a hard time about copyrighted music and my videos being banned in some countries because of the music I still have music on the longer videos....
704797,Leecher,2012-06-11 20:49:00,7832, I hear you about the copyright stuff... not sure what application you use for editing but from MS Movie Maker you can resize the song and get rid of the copyright which is usually located at the beginning of the song.... That's what I do and can add any tracks I want as long as I don't use the beginning of it
704803,misfish,2012-06-11 21:01:00,29133," Yeah, I got warnings,but I reply telling them,the radio was playing. Thats not stealing IMO.  Cool vid bud."
704806,Terry,2012-06-11 21:06:00,14456,"my account has monetization and I can upload videos longer then 15 minutes, so they are more strict , but all fun and games    I really like the nitro bass boat song but I can't find who owns it"
