He was super happy in the video.  Eastern European guy.  Smiles from ear to ear.  I don’t think there where lyrics, just this guy humming, or yodeling.  Whatever he was singing, he was so friggen happy when he was doing it.  One of my friends is going through a tough time, and I thought this video would cheer her up.  If anyone knows where to find this video, can you post a link?"

705034,NAW,2012-06-12 13:34:00,4022,No.  But that's hillarious..  I think the video I'm looking for is from a long time ago.  80's maybe?  The guys on stage.  Profesional video.
