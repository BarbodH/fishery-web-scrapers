704447,fishermccann,2012-06-10 20:53:00,655,"Yes I have used it but not on a boat. Garden furniture, white metal, put it on 4-5 years ago and still holding strong. PS. wear gloves when you mix the putty together , it was almost impossible to get off my fingers afterwards."
704523,moparhawk,2012-06-11 02:32:00,146,Damaged some rivets on a stump. After realizing my boat was leaking I ran JB Weld over the rivets. Actually a couple times. Sanded the paint off for adheasion and everything. It didn't work worth a crap really. I would try another approach.

What I do is make sure area is clean and dry and put boat in the sun to heat up the aluminum , this makes the weld flow nice . Make sure you let it dry/cure for a good 24 hours before using. Good luck !"
