704429,Pigeontroller,2012-06-10 19:25:00,2793,Does nobody read the regs???
704431,glen,2012-06-10 19:34:00,2641,Regs?  Whats that?
704436,lew,2012-06-10 19:56:00,12766," Maybe he doesn't have a copy of the regs Dax  I didn't have a copy awhile back when I needed to know when the musky opener for Nipissing was so I came on here and asked the question and I was given the info I needed.  If everybody knew all the answers to everything and nobody asked any questions, we wouldn't have nearly as many interesting discussions around here as we do now.  And for what it's worth, I still don't have a copy of the regs."

704443,Christopheraaron,2012-06-10 20:29:00,3525,"I just use the Internet version, the hard copy is easier to use though, until you lose a page of exeptions!"
704444,Ben_Daniels,2012-06-10 20:38:00,435,I agree with Lew 100%... never understood why people get flamed for asking questions about the regs
704473,Pigeontroller,2012-06-10 22:38:00,2793,Everyone should have a copy...
704508,peter23,2012-06-11 00:56:00,95,thanks guys.
