705045,Roy,2012-06-12 14:01:00,13728,"Compliments of Google.  Since 1990, Bettencourt has had his own line of custom guitars designed by Washburn Guitars. His line is known as the N-Series, and is currently promoting the Washburn N4."
705048,jigsnreels,2012-06-12 14:09:00,133,"I think it's a Washburn EA-20.  Washburn did put out an EA-22 signature model for Nuno, but I'm pretty sure it came out after Extreme II."
705059,jedimaster,2012-06-12 14:55:00,3472,The N series was his eletrics... I don't think the acoustics got much play from him...
705061,jedimaster,2012-06-12 14:58:00,3472,Yah I think your right looks like an EA-20
705073,capt bruce,2012-06-12 15:52:00,820,"I would think ea20 , thats what he played when I saw him live .I would think washburn gave him a special one but check out ebay if you like them, there are a few on there right now , for less than 300 . But you will still need Nuno's fingers and palm mutes to get the sound . Most of your tone is in your hands not the pieces of wood they are holding . I'm not a snob, martins et all are nice but I  perfer Guilds . LOOK at what  Bo Diddley made a career playing lol .. Its all in your hands"
705077,jedimaster,2012-06-12 16:02:00,3472,Is that not an EA10? http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fLxJXBWOlL8
