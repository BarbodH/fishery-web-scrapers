704530,Fisherpete,2012-06-11 02:59:00,1814,"Hi Boss,  Sorry for the late reply - was fishing the past 8 days . The leaders I made held up perfectly this week, and were battle  tested by a few big girls...  I got the Seaguar and crimps at Tightlines in Pickering. The crimps are made by Scotty - and as Lew said, make sure you get the appropriate ones - there are tons of different sizes. I had the crimping tool already.  Pete"
694672,irishfield,2012-05-09 21:25:00,26272, Better the weed snags up there than on the bait .. no?
694673,Gregoire,2012-05-09 21:49:00,1397, I like fisherpete tackle purges
694697,Fisherpete,2012-05-09 23:38:00,1814,"LOL Greg! Me too - met some great people on this board just by selling stuff!  Got the leader clips today - Gagnons had them. Could not find any 130 lb fluorocarbon however... checked at Sail too. 100 lb Seaguar was the strongest I saw. Not sure if the crimps I saw were the right ones either - they were made by Berkley and I think they are designed for steel wire.  Wayne - if memory serves, some people even add a modified treble hook at the top of the leader to catch weeds and keep them away from the lure. I think the shrink wrap just looks nice - gives the leader a more finished look. Because muskies REALLY care about that lmao! Sad part is that I will probably do it anyways!"
694722,mike rousseau,2012-05-10 00:37:00,4661, The one that would catch weeds is the one at the bait... The tag end is pointed towards the rod...  So I guess it's the same... But it makes a sexy looking leader and I'm not picking moss off the crimps every cast...  And yes you can add a treble with rounded hook points(rounded so the hook point doesnt damage the leader material...)to the mainline end of your leader to catch weeds while trolling... Works great too... I don't do it but my dad does...
694782,Fisherpete,2012-05-10 04:04:00,1814,Tackle purge has been added to classifieds  I may still add more muskie lures to the list in the next few days.
697677,Fisherpete,2012-05-18 22:41:00,1814,Found the 130lb fluoro today... and the right crimps. Will post the results after I make a few sexy leaders!  Trojan tackle trolling tower is being made as we speak  Also have a new rod on the way... Lew will approve! Will post a pic when I get it.  Need to get up to Shimano this week for the reel tune up... and to radioworld for that map chip. Almost ready to rock and roll! Only 15 more sleeps!!!
697756,Fisherpete,2012-05-19 03:22:00,1814,"Just finished making a couple muskie leaders... a 12"" for casting and a 24"" for trolling. It was fun and they turned out great!  I used all the good stuff to make them...  130lb Seaguar fluorocarbon 300lb test heavy duty swivels with welded rings Big-jon double-barrel crimps #5 Stringease stay-lok snaps Shrink tubing for sexiness... steamed on to not damage the fluorocarbon.    "
697757,mike rousseau,2012-05-19 03:24:00,4661,the tubing makes em sexy eh???  lol
697759,lew,2012-05-19 07:54:00,12766, Wouldn't happen to be a Legend Tournament would it Pete ??  Leaders look good.
697789,Dontcryformejanhrdina,2012-05-19 13:55:00,535,"Leaders look great! I should start making my own, save some money. I'm not sure I trust my skills though lol.      Can't wait for June! Got all of the gear I wanted, gonna finish sharpening some hooks."
697791,mike rousseau,2012-05-19 14:01:00,4661,   considering how long heavy flourocarbon leaders last your not saving a lot of money making your own...  but...  you get to use components and materials you choose... in the sizes and lengths you choose....  like i use 48 inch leaders in 130lb for trolling...those are hard to find sometimes... especially locally...
697792,Dontcryformejanhrdina,2012-05-19 14:15:00,535,"  Yeah I haven't seen 48"" leaders anywhere. I buy my leaders from protackle, 150# flourocarbon (3' trolling, 1' casting) and 180# steel leaders for jerkbaits. I've had a musky hit just my flourocarbon leader and it didn't break, though it was frayed in a few spots."
697806,lew,2012-05-19 14:55:00,12766," Try 8"" fluoro for jerkbait leaders and you'll get far better action on your baits."
697809,Dontcryformejanhrdina,2012-05-19 15:04:00,535," Thanks, I'll give it a try. I'll have to search around for some 8"" leaders.    I have a love-hate relationship with jerkbaits. I love the action they produce, but hate how often the fish miss them. Plus once I get it back to boatside, I'm never sure what to do in the figure 8. Should I keep twitching it, or just do a figure 8 pattern like a bucktail?"
697810,mike rousseau,2012-05-19 15:07:00,4661,  figure 8... but dont be afraid to add twiches and jerks while doing the figure 8...  got some fish on hellhounds doing that last year...
697813,lew,2012-05-19 15:45:00,12766," Yeah, you'll miss some fish with jerkbaits, just like with any other bait, but just keep the same action going all the way back to the boat and there's every chance the fish will make another grab for it. She liked the action enough the 1st time to swipe at it, so give her another chance.  Just don't be in too much of a hurry to set the hook when the fish grabs it, instead wait until you actually feel the weight of it. Too often guys will see the fish hit and actually pull the bait away from her before it's even in her mouth.  Jerkbaits are awesome for muskies and I probably get at least a 1/3 of my fish that way."
697841,Dontcryformejanhrdina,2012-05-19 21:12:00,535, I've definetely been guilty of that a few times.
697848,mike rousseau,2012-05-19 21:48:00,4661,Once you get used to it... You'll stay calm till you feel weight...  It won't take too many lost/missed fish before you realize a blow up or follow is just that... And premature hook sets will just lower your catch percentage
697895,mercman,2012-05-20 00:24:00,7054,Great info in this thread. Thanks for shring your experience guys
698066,capt_hooked,2012-05-20 22:03:00,212,"  Those are great clips.. I had some and ran out... and can not find them... where do you pick them up?   thanks,  the cap't."
702784,BucktownAngler,2012-06-04 17:26:00,582,  i get them at JB's  i believe i may have seen them before at BPS but not 100% sure. Maybe someone else will know
702787,BucktownAngler,2012-06-04 17:32:00,582,  where do you find the 130lb seaguar and crimps/crimping tool
702790,lew,2012-06-04 17:36:00,12766," You should be able to get everything you need at JB's Boss, if your in the area that is."
702793,BucktownAngler,2012-06-04 17:44:00,582," thx Lew, ill have to take a look next time im over there"
702824,lew,2012-06-04 20:09:00,12766, Just be sure to get the proper size crimps for the fluoro your gonna be using Boss as there's different sizes.
693266,Fisherpete,2012-05-05 15:51:00,1814,"It's less than a month until my 10 day annual muskie trip  There are a few items I would like to add to the arsenal for this years trip, but would like a little advice/feedback from the muskie experts on the board.  1) Does anyone know of a tackle supplier in or near Whitby that sells just the clips for the business end of the fluorocarbon leaders? I have picked them up from JB's before, but it's a bit of a hike now for me. I like to replace them every few days of fishing as I find the metal gets fatigued after multiple lure changes.  2) What is the best file to get for sharpening muskie sized hooks? I have one of the small carbide ones from CT, and it works great on smaller hooks, but I think it's time to get a proper one for the big lures.  3) I was out fishing with Geoff from this site last year, and in his boat he had the Salty rod holders on custom towers. The rod clamps on saltys were coated in rubber - protecting the reel finish - he told me where he got them, but I forgot. Somewhere in Woodstock I think? Does anyone know, and have any idea of a price? I would love to upgrade to these. If anyone knows the approximate price that would also be sweet.  4) I think it is probably time to get my two Shimano baitcasting reels tuned up (Calcutta and Tekota) - where would you guys recommend? Take them to Shimano in Peterborough? I seem to remember that there is someone good in Orillia? I have taken reels to Aikmans in Missisauga before, but it's pretty far for me now, and to be honest was not very happy with the turnaround time nor the end result in the reel.  I also have four Quantum Energy spinning reels that could use a little TLC... they have taken their share of wear and tear casting muskie sized lures before I converted to baitcasters in the last few years. Would like to see how much it would cost to get them running smoothly again - if even possible.  5) What would you guys recommend for a mapping chip for my Lowrance Elite 5? A packaged chip came with it when I bought it from LeBaron's, and it is decent, but I really would like the one that has the 1' contour lines for the Kawartha lakes. Again I heard that the guy in Woodstock might be the best option for a chip - as he takes trade ins? Any info would be appreciated.  29 more sleeps until slime time!!!!  Thanks so much for any help and info guys.  Peter"
693268,lew,2012-05-05 16:05:00,12766,"I use #5 Stringeze snaps Pete and they last forever, infact I can go all season without changing them and have never had an issue with them.  Pretty sure you can get them at Tightlines on Brock Rd. in Pickering just south of the 401.  I like a fine tooth file for my hooks and just use a regular triangle shaped file and it works very well. Pick them up at any hardware store.  I've had work done at Shimano in P'Boro and have always been happy."
693269,Weeds,2012-05-05 16:05:00,782,I took my Curado in to have it serviced here in Peterborough last Summer. I was amazed in the differnce between before and after. They cleaned it all up and even replaced a bearing or two if I remember correctly. Felt like a new reel after. Pretty sweet for 25 bucks. Only downside was they continued to send me a bill for the service even though I paid for it at the time. I had to phone them back once a month for 3 or 4 monthes.
693270,mike rousseau,2012-05-05 16:14:00,4661,"i have one of these hook files and i like it....  http://www.muskyshop.com/modules/cart/products.php/keys/file/page/1/id/633/name/LuhrJensenHookFile512  as for snaps on the business end...  http://www.muskyshop.com/modules/cart/products.php/nav_id/5/page/2/id/1139/name/StringeaseStayLocProSnaps   from the sounds of it you want a few things... an online order might be a good option... i get all my gear at rollie and helens musky shop online... great service...  and then you can get yourself a few new lures too...    and were the salty rod holders the powder coated? or did they actually have ""rubber"" on them... because i have never heard of rubber coated saltys before... but i do have the powder coated ones...   ..."
693293,Fisherpete,2012-05-05 17:44:00,1814,"Thanks Lew - thought a regular file would do the trick, just was wondering if there was something specific out there to do the job. Tightlines is right down the road from my work - I will check them out for the snaps for sure. I figured Shimano would probably be my best bet - after all they would have the parts right there. The reels are still working fine, but I have had the Calcutta TE for 3 seasons and the Tekota for 2, and want to keep them running well for the long run. But what to do with the Quantums... hmmm...  Mike - they were rubber coated for sure, but just the top part where it holds the reel. Keeps the reel from getting scratched up. They were mounted on a custom little tower made out of machined aluminum - something like a downrigger tower? Was really solid and made it very easy to adjust the rod angle and direction. Pretty sure it was from that place in Woodstock - anyone know the name? I'm good in the lures department... been collecting some new weapons over the winter. However I am still interested in those ones we talked about that you had for sale if you are passing this way anytime soon!  Peter"

693356,irishfield,2012-05-05 21:38:00,26272,Get a can of liquid rubber (sold for coating tool handles and such).. put some in a plastic dish and just dip the salty until it's the thickness our like. Me personally.. scratches on the reel just mean you're getting out!!  File.. I like the dual file sold my Rollie and Helen's Muskie shop. It's just two files in a single handle strapped together at the end. Works well with a couple passes and you're done on both sides!
693366,Gregoire,2012-05-05 22:22:00,1397,"I recently picked up a a rapala sharpener from pro tackle musky shop in Belleville. http://www.protacklemuskyshop.com/. I was on my way home from Montreal and stopped in. Great selection and service. Send an e-mail and ask for what you want, I think the guys name is Stacy. The sharpener I bought is not on the website, but I am sure if you asked him about the musky sized hook sharpener from rapala Stacy would know what you are talking about. If you make an order of $150 or more shipping is free. They also have a certain colour sledge that is hard to find, in case you are interested in casting a bit more this year."

694315,Fisherpete,2012-05-08 18:51:00,1814,"Thanks for all the input guys! Time to break out the $$$ lol!  Thanks for the link Geoff, I really like the custom towers that Trojan tackle sells, but haven't called to ask about pricing yet. Wayne's idea about rubber dipping has me thinking about making my own...  I found a really nice hook file at Sail the other day, as well as a wicked pair of fishing scissors... so those are taken care of.  Andrew - how ya doin man! You get out on the weekend at all? Radioworld huh, I will check them out. I did really like the chip in your boat last summer.  I am also considering starting to make my own fluorocarbon leaders this year... I think there is some $ to be saved there for sure. Buy a spool of 100lb Seaguar, some of the previously mentioned clips and some heavy swivels, and learn how to tie the appropriate knots ( I have heard that crimps are not the best idea?). I think it would actually be a fun little project, as well as being able to customize the lengths.  24 more sleeps!  Peter"

For pike, I use 50# and tie those.  Perfection Loop is what I use on the snap end and I either tie directly to the braid via uni to uni for jerkbaits or to a swivel for stuff that'll twist the line.
