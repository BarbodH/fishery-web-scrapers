704331,thenrifi,2012-06-10 11:06:00,1,"Hi Guys and Gals I fish out of Wheatley almost exclusively starting right now. I had a great year last year and I think things are set to fire up very soon now. Don't look for a big boat though. After fishing big boats such as the 27 foot hardtop Sportcraft for 10 years, I am having an absolute riot fishing an old 16 footer named the S.S. Miinow. It fishes great, cheap and it is easy to control. After several years of running charters, I fish alone much of the time now and ""fish for fun"".  Of 20 trips fishing out of Wheatley, I got skunked 1 particularly bad morning. I had many days of limits of both rainbow and walleye. I manage a website that would help you keep in touch with the Wheatley fishing and I post regularly including locations, baits used and hot news. No big ""secret - secret"" like so many of those chest thumpers out there that think it makes them important to play the secret game. For current news I think it would be helpful to visit http://www.tomsvirtualmall.com/foolproof-guide-to-fishing-wheatley/ Tight Lines - Tom Henricks"
