704224,BillM,2012-06-09 17:59:00,17367,Wow that river has dropped since the last time I fished it..   :eek:
704231,misfish,2012-06-09 18:15:00,29133," It wasn,t to bad Bill. Oh and thanks for the tip bud. I was wondering if I was going to find the water.Good long walk though.I was very surprised,I didnt see any wild life. Im thinking I,m done  for now on that piece of water.The growth is to much to thrash through,and the water is getting warmer. I,m going to start playing in the big river for a bit. Pike and maybe  there are some steel in the fast waters.  When bass opens,they will be my next target."
704232,BillM,2012-06-09 18:21:00,17367,"NP man, I like fishing that place before the vegetation takes over, lol!   Water is getting a bit warm anyhow.."
