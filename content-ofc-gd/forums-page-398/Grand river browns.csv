704268,BillM,2012-06-09 23:23:00,17367,"30 degrees and sunny?  Not a good day to try and fish one of the most pressured systems in all of southern Ontario.  It's tough fishing at the best of times...  If you do go, bring your sunscreen"

I probably wouldn't have picked yesterday but for my brother inlaws birthday we got him a learn to fly fish day and I joined him. Although alot of review for me, I still learned a tonne from our guide and managed some fish. My poor brother inlaw did well in picking up the sport but never landed a fish. But he learned lots and seems motivated to try again."
