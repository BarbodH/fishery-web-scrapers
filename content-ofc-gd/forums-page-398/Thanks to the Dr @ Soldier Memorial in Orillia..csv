704816,Joey,2012-06-11 21:30:00,9122, That's what I was thinking Lew.  Ouch  Glad you got it all fixed up Bill - been there myself a time or two
704817,Rod Caster,2012-06-11 21:35:00,5784,"Walk it off. Haha. I won't laugh too hard, karna will otherwise find a way to get back at me!"
704827,Ben_Daniels,2012-06-11 21:59:00,435,  Who needs doctors?
704829,nroadrunner,2012-06-11 22:02:00,113,Man my finger hurts just thinking about it  Top notch doctors in orillia I agree on that.    Ian
704885,Twocoda,2012-06-12 00:29:00,4130,I wonder what you could have caught if you used the finger as bait...
704912,esoxansteel,2012-06-12 01:44:00,1307,"    Probably that hooker from Barrie, thats been known to hang around the soldiers at CFB Bordon, thats been in the news frequently."
704928,BillM,2012-06-12 02:16:00,17367," Lew, it pretty much was horizontal with the nail.. In the pic you can see two small black dots on the tip of my finger.. Left is blood, right is the hook point about to break the skin.  No way I was going to mess with that... Let the pro's do the work, that's what we pay taxes for"
704932,ketchenany,2012-06-12 02:21:00,3229,"Bill, that is nasty, if he wasn't out of season you would have made him pay big time - the frying pan! Wrong, you can't eat them . . . Fry him anyway just to get even!"
704940,BillM,2012-06-12 02:33:00,17367,"Al, they don't taste very good out of that lake  (According to the oldman)   Only one to blame was me, should have been more careful..  Once I got the top hook out I should have lipped it, then proceeded to take the bottom one out.."
705110,Dave Bailey,2012-06-12 17:18:00,1641," Yeah, but they probably get a lot of practise removing hooks, maybe even daily!"
705188,Billy Bob,2012-06-12 20:33:00,5865,OUCH.......glad it worked out for you....
705246,ketchenany,2012-06-13 00:43:00,3229," Bill, Good tough Ontario lad. Probably had more pain following Solo with a canoe on his back for 10 km or fishing the  Geen for steelhead and froze his hands off. I've been there."
704688,BillM,2012-06-11 17:47:00,17367,"............for taking this damn hook out of my finger on Sunday     What was even cooler is that he was from Terrace BC, just recently moved here and is a hardcore fly fisherman.   First thing he says is 'You should have been using barbless!', lol!!!  Talked fishing for 15mins while the local took, then he cut the hook, pushed it through and I was all done.   I also offered to take him out for some steelheading in the fall, he seemed super pumped (We exchanged contact info)..."
704691,bushart,2012-06-11 17:49:00,2628,OOOUUUCHH!!!!!   10 cc's Coors Light Stat!!
704700,johnnyb,2012-06-11 17:56:00,3413,Oooohhhh....I almost got to see what my lunch looks like an hour later.....  So...how'd it get in there?
704705,BillM,2012-06-11 18:00:00,17367,"Fishing for pike with the oldman, hooked a OOS smallie 5 mins in.  Had the bottom treble of the Rapala X-Rap buried right under it's head.. I couldn't lip it because it had the top set of trebles in it's mouth..  So I grabbed it behind the gills like I do pike.  Popped the top set of hooks, started to work on the bottom and it went ape.  Top hooks found my finger and 3lbs+ of him flopping around really dug it in there.  So now I've got hook super deep into my finger and all I can do is hold the fish..  My Dad pulled the hooks out of the fish and got him back in the drink, then we had to remove the hook from the lure itself.  That was fun    After we got it out we ran back to the launch and dropped the truck/boat off at home.  Drove to Orillia, in and out in about 30mins, back on the water by 10:30"
704708,ratherboutdoors,2012-06-11 18:05:00,132,"OOuch!!!  30 mins though....  next time I might run right by RVH to soldiers, extra 30 mins on the hwy but likely saved 4 hrs in emerg."
704712,BillM,2012-06-11 18:09:00,17367," I rarely go to the hospital for emergency stuff.  If I was in Barrie, I would have gone to a walk-in clinic.  From my experiences it's a lot faster.  But the staff at Orillia has me in and outta there in no time!"
704713,wallacio,2012-06-11 18:10:00,475,Damn buddy!  Just another reason why I hate Bass!  LOL!   I like that you took the time to get some shots of the mishap!
704714,mercman,2012-06-11 18:13:00,7054,Now i know why my buddy Mike had such a look of horror on his face as i tried to unhook the smallie i caught while fishing with him a couple weeks ago.Those things go ape when you try taking the hook out.
704715,BillM,2012-06-11 18:13:00,17367, Dirty bass!  LOL!   Really didn't hurt unless I touched it..  Best part was getting the hook caught on the bow rope while trying to put the boat on the trailer!  I let out a few expletives when that happened.
704716,solopaddler,2012-06-11 18:15:00,8605,"Remember this Billy?  Deja vu!  HAHAHAHA!   <iframe width=""560"" height=""315"" src=""http://www.youtube.com/embed/KlsYH-eHAjQ"" frameborder=""0"" allowfullscreen></iframe>"
704718,BillM,2012-06-11 18:19:00,17367,Luckily I could take care of that one in the boat!
704725,Dave Bailey,2012-06-11 18:24:00,1641, 30 minutes?! Took me a couple of hours for the same problem at the same hospital a couple of years ago. You must know somebody there.
704729,BillM,2012-06-11 18:30:00,17367, No one was there went I checked in... I guess I got lucky.
704733,esoxansteel,2012-06-11 18:38:00,1307,"Always good yo know a doc, and exchange phone numbers Bill, a lawyer is another good one to get, i roared at Mikes video, as weve all been there before, ands its unfortunately nice to see someone elses misfortune for a change."
704742,misfish,2012-06-11 19:06:00,29133,"LMAO MIKE. ""This is awesome"".   Mike ,maybe stick to single hook fishing."
704750,capt bruce,2012-06-11 19:13:00,820,"  B, singles stick just as good as trebles lol , thru a cheater out once and put a single siwash right thru my finger in one side fully out the other , thats what you get for fishing sharp hooks and not paying attention .. OUch Bill I know the feeling ..."
704751,John,2012-06-11 19:14:00,2956,Looks like a 3 or 4 shots of scotch job to me Bill...
704752,misfish,2012-06-11 19:15:00,29133," I was referring to steelheading or fly fishing, B."
704760,kickingfrog,2012-06-11 19:23:00,8333,"Not that getting ""hooked"" is ever good but I would imagine that close to the nail would be worse then most other areas of the hand."
704766,johnnyb,2012-06-11 19:39:00,3413,"A good reminder that a pair of cutters are handy, even if you aren't musky fishing.  Cutting the other points off that treble would've been a lot easire than sliding it off the split ring....plus you wouldn't have gotten such a good grip on the bowline at the launch  I keep a small pair that I originally bought for downrigging, in case I ever had to cut the cable.  So far, they've snipped 2 trebles and no cables"
704770,davey buoy,2012-06-11 19:52:00,5505,"Good to hear all went well and than back on the lake. I've dodged that bullet so far,but not looking forward to that."
704773,Leecher,2012-06-11 20:10:00,7832,You seemed to have a nag to get hooked     That had to hurt   Glad the Dr got it all sorted out for ya
704783,BillM,2012-06-11 20:31:00,17367," Johnny, we've always got a pair of good cutters on board.  Unfortunately, they were on the oldmans work bench this time around, lol!!"
704786,DRIFTER_016,2012-06-11 20:36:00,10439,Put a hook in my finger while getting set up for a charter on Lake O once. Used the heavy line/ downward pressure on the hook eye yank trick. Worked mint and didn't miss a beat. Charter left the dock on time.
704796,lew,2012-06-11 20:46:00,12766,"Jeeez Bill, that looks just plain nasty.  Bad enough when it's in a hand but under the fingernail must have been alot tougher for the Doc to push thru ??"
