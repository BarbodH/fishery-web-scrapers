I figure I was down about 50 feet deep, but caught them trolling over 90, 100, 120, 70 and 150 foot depths.    Decided to head across the lake and up a little river into another lake. While casting for Pike we saw something making it's way towards us, then away from us...  doe... a deer... a female deer... (now you have the song in your head... you're welcome)    I figured silver would have worked... What do you think?    We kept our distance while she was deep, only moving a little closer for a better picture as she starting to reach bottom near shore. (only had the phone camera) Don't worry folks, she made it to shore safely and bounced away into the bush."
704618,The JAY,2012-06-11 14:33:00,239,Nice! I'm wondering what pound test folks here use for whitetails though?

704790,Broker,2012-06-11 20:39:00,482,Neat pictures! So did you catch the majority of fish at 50 fow?
704869,chris.brock,2012-06-11 23:52:00,4053,How did you get down 50 feet flatlining?
704871,Joeytier,2012-06-11 23:57:00,3990,"Nice troots and cool shots!  They are great swimmers, for sure"
705003,Jacob,2012-06-12 11:55:00,186,Great pics.
705009,Rod Caster,2012-06-12 12:18:00,5784,Nice eater size laker. I still can't wrap my head around how hooves are good paddles.... But if it works it works.
705011,woodenboater,2012-06-12 12:20:00,2277,I dunno but I doubt Frabill makes a cradle big enough for Bambi
705015,Spanky80,2012-06-12 12:48:00,152,Incredible!  Awesome pics!
705053,Lip-ripper,2012-06-12 14:18:00,228, I had it trailing behind a 4 oz bottom walker. And that was just using a setup that had braided line on it. When we flatline with steel line we are bouncing off bottom in 80+ FOW.
