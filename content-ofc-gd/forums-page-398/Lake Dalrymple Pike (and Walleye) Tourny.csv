704769,hookerdown,2012-06-11 19:51:00,110,I have been fishing Lake Dalrymple for years.  I have always wanted to fish this tourney but never managed to get on the water for it.  I have never seen any results posted for it.  Can anyone provide any info on the results and how I can get involved in the tourny next year?
704956,Paudash,2012-06-12 03:21:00,273,I am not sure if they still have it.  I know I was involved in a tournament the opening weekend that was run out of the cottage resort for years but I heard it fell apart last year.  I have not been in the last 4 years but I went the 10 prior.  Call the resort and they should be able to help you out
