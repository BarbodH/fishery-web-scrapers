704226,jigsnreels,2012-06-09 18:06:00,133, Pretty sure he'd prefer to keep his toes...  :-0
704241,lickmyarmpit,2012-06-09 19:15:00,359,"Hahahhahaha, I knew they were aggressive but I've never seen anything like that before."

704249,The JAY,2012-06-09 20:46:00,239,That'll put skinny dipping out of the question....
704253,Dozer,2012-06-09 21:49:00,896,"Check the reg's, targeting OOS bass is illegal  Great video, thanks for the laugh."
704254,Stoty,2012-06-09 21:54:00,2910,That's awesome!!!!!

704297,Blue Lk,2012-06-10 01:26:00,337,"Thanks for all the replies,I laugh everytime I watch it. GF had tears streaming down her face on the dock. The whole area in front of my place is infected with nesting bass,not a bad thing if you know what to look for. The dogs aren't too eager to jump in for a swim by the dock,they both have been bumped,so funny to watch."
704518,asdve23rveavwa,2012-06-11 02:27:00,2690,"I'm Missing something...all I see is 7 seconds of you walking through water, no fish  Just got it to work, awesome!!!"
704121,Blue Lk,2012-06-09 11:08:00,337,"It seems I get nesting smallmouths under my dock every year. Normally they come out & give you a bump around the ankles,decided to catch the ""action the other day. GF had the camera while I aproached the dock. The jerk surprised me when he dashed out & bite my big toe. As you may be able to tell,he surprised me pretty good. Click for short vid.  "
704122,davey buoy,2012-06-09 11:19:00,5505,Didn't know they were that aggressive when spawning!
704123,Roy,2012-06-09 11:19:00,13728,"Now that's funny.  I'm going to work on a ""big toe"" jig head. And to think, folks try to match the hatch...use fluorocarbon to not be so visible.  Thanks for sharing."
704124,Handlebarz,2012-06-09 11:32:00,3790,That was funny. They sure do protect there nests and I guess they are not afraid of anything. Thanks for tge morning chuckle.
704126,NAW,2012-06-09 11:35:00,4022,Cool video man.  I've never seen a bass do that before.  It looked like she really grabbed on for a second there!
704129,Roy,2012-06-09 11:51:00,13728, She would have held on for longer if he'd have used scent.
704131,woodenboater,2012-06-09 12:07:00,2277,"  make a silicone cast of your toe, put it on a slow death hook and hang on lol"
704132,grimsbylander,2012-06-09 12:12:00,3016,LMAO! I've NEVER seen anything like that! How did your girlfriend not fall off the dock laughing?! Awesome vid!!
704133,Broker,2012-06-09 12:29:00,482,I had no idea they did that :s
704134,Harrison,2012-06-09 12:33:00,2202,"Ha, that was priceless,great laugh to start the day.  Thanks for that."
704137,whiskywizard,2012-06-09 12:41:00,305,Very funny!  Any musky nests nearby that you can visit next for us?
704140,rmarentette,2012-06-09 12:44:00,124,That was excellent! Thanks for the laugh.
704144,Acountdeleted,2012-06-09 12:50:00,2562,I had a prof once that told me that if bass were big enough they would eat us. Haha i guess this one just has dilusions of gradure.
704158,Christopheraaron,2012-06-09 13:43:00,3525,"Bite it's toe, see how he likes it!"

704163,tb4me,2012-06-09 14:02:00,3295,"lol I laughed my arse off..Spawning bass are highly aagressive, as you can see"
704173,Pigeontroller,2012-06-09 14:24:00,2793,"Very cool. As anyone that has Scuba Dived can attest, Bass are very territorial and can be aggressive!"
704175,lew,2012-06-09 14:27:00,12766,If that was a dog the owners would be ordered to keep that nasty thing on a leash  Great video !!
704176,mike rousseau,2012-06-09 14:29:00,4661,rockbass get us all the time... they nest under pretty well every dock in our bay... and when you take the last step off the ladder... BANG they bite your toes... and dont stop till your out of their area... i know theyre little fish but it scares the poop out of you if you forget theyre still nesting and they get you...
704178,GBW,2012-06-09 14:41:00,8460,I have the same problem every time we put the last section of dock in the lake.  this little 1lb'er kept going after me all the time last year.
704182,Musky or Specks,2012-06-09 14:48:00,2710,That's funny. I won't mention how you squealed like a little girl
704184,Rizzo,2012-06-09 15:02:00,4754,"showed that video to my kids, now they refuse to go swimming and they keep asking ""What did that guy say?"". Cool video!"
704187,OhioFisherman,2012-06-09 15:09:00,6623,Great! LOL I have had them hit a lure before it hit the water flipped in their zone.
704189,fishnsled,2012-06-09 15:20:00,3520," Didn't like the toe jam scent I guess Roy.  Great video, thanks for the laugh."
704192,Roy,2012-06-09 15:41:00,13728,"And what are we calling it a ""she"" for when it's the males who guard the nest?"
