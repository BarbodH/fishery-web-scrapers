704105,Handlebarz,2012-06-09 04:19:00,3790,I was just wondering what size and kinds of sd cards do you all use in your go pro?
704106,Roy,2012-06-09 04:24:00,13728,Get the best quality Class 10 cards you can get Mike. I only have one camera now and using two 32G cards.
704108,Stoty,2012-06-09 04:26:00,2910," EXACTLY! Don't even waste your money on anything less than a class 10, as they will make your video all choppy. If you use anything less, its like having an HDTV with an analog signal! lol"
704109,Handlebarz,2012-06-09 04:41:00,3790,Ok that's what I needed to know as I have class 6 and the Gopro book calls for class 4 or better I will be hitting FS tomorrow.

704111,Dan668,2012-06-09 04:51:00,1120,I use uhs1 for my dslr. Faster than class 10. Not sure if its supported by go pro though  Find a canadacomputers. You can pick up class tens for under 20 bucks
704167,Djeep,2012-06-09 14:06:00,199,"i have a class 10 and class 6. I do not notice the difference when filming in 960. The class 10 is always good for piece of mind, as not all cards are rated equal I believe."
704335,Stoty,2012-06-10 12:00:00,2910,"I had nothing but issues with a class 6 card that I already had. Video was all choppy. Went to a class 10, and haven't had an issue since."
704341,Handlebarz,2012-06-10 12:45:00,3790,I forgot to hit FS yesterday maybe I will remember today. I did get some ribs and am getting them ready for dinner today mmmmmmmmmm BBQ ribs
