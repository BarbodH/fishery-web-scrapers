704632,sneak_e_pete,2012-06-11 15:37:00,540,Are there rod holders that don't require drilling holes in the boat to mount them?
704635,bigbuck,2012-06-11 15:46:00,2449,"Salty's Down Easters have clamps that would work on a tinny. As for a boat with deeper and thicker gunnels, drilling is the only way to go. I'm resisting too, because I don't want to drill a bunch of holes in my fish'n ski bowrider."
704640,Grimace,2012-06-11 16:01:00,2020,For the boats with the bigger gunwales get the track system.  You drill some holes but then you can slide your rod holders wherever you want to.  I have the Bert's system and love it.
704641,misfish,2012-06-11 16:04:00,29133,Ya Tybo has this on his boat. I really like that set up.

704660,Roy,2012-06-11 16:47:00,13728,What kind of a boat did you end up with?
704662,Tybo,2012-06-11 17:00:00,1373,"With the track system I can install my riggers and rod holders,The salty rod holders for muskie and just rod holders for planer boards."
704675,sneak_e_pete,2012-06-11 17:14:00,540,Smokercraft promag... Wide gunnels.  Being delivered this week!
704676,BillM,2012-06-11 17:15:00,17367,"If you've got space on the gunnels, why not just mount them?  We've got a few of the flush mount Scottys on the Lund..  Work great for anything we've put in them (Even dipsys out on Lake O)"
704698,sneak_e_pete,2012-06-11 17:55:00,540,Probably best to mount.  Just hate the idea of making holes in a new boat
704702,BillM,2012-06-11 17:57:00,17367, You'll get over it quickly
704758,John,2012-06-11 19:22:00,2956,Tracks for sure.....gives you so much flexibility and many options.
704762,ch312,2012-06-11 19:26:00,1590,i rigged this one up for the planer board rods. just slide the seat off the post and the rod holder slides right in.  a new and improved model is in the works...  
704772,davey buoy,2012-06-11 20:02:00,5505,"I really like the do it you self ideas!,something like this one looks and probably works great."
704798,Broker,2012-06-11 20:49:00,482,"Was wondering the same thing, except for the kayak .."
704810,esoxansteel,2012-06-11 21:22:00,1307,"Try googling Trojan tackle for all his track systems and high rises for the downeasters, his website shows different setups which are all custom made"
704914,alexmedic,2012-06-12 01:51:00,186,Here is what I came up with when not wanting to drill:    
704916,walleye wanderer,2012-06-12 01:57:00,64,"Just spent a week up north and demo'ed Sea Suckers rod holders, a nifty lightweight suction type rod holder that is great for fly-in trips. Stuck it onto a aluminum boat the first day and no problems for the next six days, stayed tight and held up through some rough water. I give this product a thumbs up for non-permenent rod holder and I bet they would work even better on a fiberglass boat as it has a smoother surface than the pop can boat. Used the Saltys for years and they are great as well! SeaSucker site "
704934,Sinker,2012-06-12 02:25:00,8692,"Tracks are the way to go. You can run everything out of them. They may seem pricey to start, but they are worth every penny.  S."
704951,sneak_e_pete,2012-06-12 03:02:00,540,What are tracks?
704953,Sinker,2012-06-12 03:10:00,8692,"Take a look here: http://www.teclausa.com/bert/products.html  Or here:  http://trojantackle.ca/  The only way to go IMO. I would never drill a hole for a single rod holder, when you can mount a length of track, to hold multiple rods, riggers...anything.  You only drill holes for the tracks once.  S."
704974,GYPSY400,2012-06-12 09:54:00,191,It not yours until you drill the first hole!
704975,Stoty,2012-06-12 09:59:00,2910,   AMEN BROTHER!!! hahahaha
