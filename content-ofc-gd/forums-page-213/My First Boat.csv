873048,Crazy Ivan,2014-09-18 13:58:00,184,Those pro v's from the 90's were really built to last. They will take a real pounding with ease.  Take good care of it and it may outlive you!
873134,Reel Man,2014-09-19 05:43:00,80,"Jealous!  Still planning for my first boat here.  Looks like a fantastic outfit though, congrats!"
873144,wormdunker,2014-09-19 11:52:00,1711,Nice rig.  I'm jealous!  I love my 14' Lund for the smaller northern Ontario lakes.  All the positive advertising about Lund is true!!
873147,Brettiop,2014-09-19 12:39:00,279,"Couldn't resist putting this up, we had a fun night out trolling last night, two good rips within the first 20 minutes, both turning out to be pike  Trolling through 3-4 foot rollers was easy peasy, and blasting through the 2 footers at 40 mph on the way back in was a great feeling. "

873177,aznphil,2014-09-19 16:20:00,73,sweet pro v...super clean congrats on the find.  I was always skeptical about 90's rigs but yours couldve fooled me.
874386,lunkerbasshunter,2014-09-28 17:21:00,2585,great boat!  Looks to be in great shape for a 92.  Take care of her and she will take care of you!  Cheers
874430,creditmaster,2014-09-28 21:23:00,190,Nice boat man!!
872911,Brettiop,2014-09-17 14:23:00,279,"Well i have been searching for my first boat for a few months now, finally found one that i like and made an offer!  I was mostly interested in a good musky casting rig, with the ability to go out on the big lakes and troll steelhead/salmon when needed, i think i found the perfect rig for my needs. Not to big, but can handle the rough water if needed  1992, Lund 1890 PROv dlx 1992 115 Merc 2012 9.9 Suzuki kicker It came with some Big Jon downriggers and some downriggin rods and tackle as well.  Love the boat! got out last night for the maiden voyage and managed to land the first fish in the new rig, that was awesome! Had multiple other follows and a few lost fish as well, they will have to wait until next time.  My brother also got a nice pike...couldn't keep his musky pinned though...  Manged to hit 42.5 MPH with 4 ppl and a dog on board, was surprised at that.    "
872912,leaf4,2014-09-17 14:26:00,2466,Nice! congrats on the purchase
872914,glenner,2014-09-17 14:27:00,56,"Very nice looking rig, seems to be in great shape for a 1992! Enjoy."
872916,sneak_e_pete,2014-09-17 14:27:00,540,Sweet ride!!! Congrats!
872918,BillM,2014-09-17 14:30:00,17367,"That thing must haul ass with a 115 2-stroke on the back, lol!!  Nice rig."
872923,Joeytier,2014-09-17 14:37:00,3990,"Very nice rig.  Many, many years of life left in that rig still!"
872925,2 tone z71,2014-09-17 14:40:00,1311,awesome and congrats..that's a great first boat...those older Lunds are built to last
872926,kennyman,2014-09-17 15:03:00,737,Nice first boat !!! I still have a 14ft tinny with an 8hp yammy.
872928,Brettiop,2014-09-17 15:20:00,279,"Thanks guys, I'm super impressed with the boat so far,  The previous owner took out all the old carpet and re-did with Nautolex Marine vinyl.  I much prefer this, the carpets are hard to clean and look bad when faded/roughed up, I think that's why it looks like such good condition.  I looked at so many boats over this search, starcraft/crestliner/legend/tracker you name it....never really considered lund because most were 2-3000 over my budget...  This one had more horsepower and was longer/wider then pretty much everything i was looking at, so the decision was easy when it popped up right at the top edge of my budget.  Had to drive 3.5 hours to go get her on a moments notice, well worth it!"
872932,Tim Mills,2014-09-17 15:28:00,476,"you got some good value added items galv trailer, riggers. kicker congrats and nice fish"
872935,fishnsled,2014-09-17 15:47:00,3520,Ya done good!  Sweet ride!!  Congrats
872936,AKRISONER,2014-09-17 15:59:00,5558,"mega jealous of this fishing rig, the downrigging gear is a steal anyways!"
872938,asdve23rveavwa,2014-09-17 16:01:00,2690,"Enjoy!!!  Really nice looking rig, especially for a '92!"
872944,linweir,2014-09-17 16:22:00,202,Previous owner must maintain the boat well. Seems its carpet has been replaced.  Congrat.
872950,mistaredone,2014-09-17 17:05:00,913,Nice rig man!  Looks like you made a good choice.
872953,fishindevil,2014-09-17 17:40:00,6254,"wow !!! awesome rig man...and its a big prov lund....no problems with big water there...she is great shape too,many years left on her too...great choice"
872955,Thrilla,2014-09-17 17:55:00,164,Beauty boat and nice fish to slime it for the first time!
872983,Pigeontroller,2014-09-17 21:30:00,2793,"Nice boat, and nice Muskie! Its a spotty, very interesting colours, definately not a Pike."
872986,davey buoy,2014-09-17 21:45:00,5505,"Congrats,sweet boat as said,also not bad results for a first run!!!!. Enjoy."
872987,kickingfrog,2014-09-17 21:53:00,8333,Very nice. Put a ton of gasoline through it because this winter is going to seem like the coming of the next ice-age while you wait for spring.
872988,davey buoy,2014-09-17 21:58:00,5505,Looks also like a front bow electric may be added soon.Perfect package.
872990,RickOnt,2014-09-17 22:04:00,669,"First Boat   Exciting times  for sure!  Great looking rig,  For a fishing boat the Vinyl floor is way better than carpet."
873011,Djeep,2014-09-18 00:41:00,199,awesome purchase!  I recently just upgraded and I love my alumacraft/etec but I did see that rig pop up on kijiji and thought it was a excellent deal!  im glad to see that it went to an OFC member. thats one super versatile boat and perfect for your intentions.  congrats. good luck with the slime this fall.
873021,Old Ironmaker,2014-09-18 01:31:00,8243,"You are going to love that rig. And you will thank yourself for going at least 18'. I love the dual council, you fishing partner will love it too. You get so much more deck space than the full wind shield and a few 100 pounds lighter to boot."
873042,Brettiop,2014-09-18 12:45:00,279,"Thanks everyone!  And old iron maker, the dual console is nice for sure. Also sweet how it can pop off with 4 screws if i want a bigger casting deck up front. Probably going to try that tonight if it isn't to wavy out there"
