We used various baits from wacky rig, to flipping jig, to twister, to drop shot. The wacky caught the most, but the flipping jig caught the largest. The walleye happened to be caught on the drop shot. A great day to be on he water in September, but a little tough on the fishing once the sun got up there! That's my buddy Jack holding the double header. Not huge but always exciting. "
