In looking at the instructions apparently the card cant be bigger than 2GB. Anyone know a way around this? Or do I just need to suck it up and buy yet one more SD card?"

It may have ZERO to do with your Navionics problem but worth a try. Only try with a blank card as this will wipe a memory card clean. If your not a computer guy I would 100% just go buy a cheap 2G card and avoid the hassle.  Of course if someone knows a proper Navionics memory card solution than ignore mine.
