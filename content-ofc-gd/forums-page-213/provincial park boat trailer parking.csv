873830,porkpie,2014-09-24 14:06:00,2521,I used to do it all the time.  Just put your expensive stuff in the truck!
873911,Mister G,2014-09-24 21:10:00,1429,Did it for years when I owned a van......bedtime take everything out of the van for sleeping room and put in boat. Cover boat. Wake up 15 minutes earlier and uncover boat. Take everything out of boat and put back in van. Make coffee on Coleman stove.  Go fishing. Repeat the next night and next morning.
