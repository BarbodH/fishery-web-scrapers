873863,James77,2014-09-24 17:42:00,175,"Hey Guys,  I caught this earlier this spring, didn't have a tape measure unfortunately so I couldn't get a measurement.  It dwarfed some 25"" fish we got earlier that night, but it was fairly thin. For reference I'm about 6'4 300 pounds so I might make the fish look a bit small lol.  Hoping some walleye experts could chime in with some guesses.  James "
873864,BillM,2014-09-24 17:45:00,17367,Maybe 6-7lbs?  It doesn't seem overly girthy.
873866,mike rousseau,2014-09-24 17:47:00,4661,I'm the same size  I'm putting at 8-9 pounds...  To skinny to make 10 pounds
873878,Terry,2014-09-24 19:03:00,14456,under 10lbs  but nice fish
873890,James77,2014-09-24 19:49:00,175,"Any guesses on the length? It was very skinny for it's size but fought like a champ. Cool story as I got him on, fought him and he came off. Tossed the lure into the current again and boom back on."
873916,BillM,2014-09-24 21:37:00,17367,Measure it next time and you'll know for sure
873924,landry,2014-09-24 22:26:00,1005,That's funny Bill. It's a nice fish. 7 pounds tops I think though.
873926,Fisherpete,2014-09-24 22:50:00,1814,I'm going with Mike's guess of 8-9lbs... he catches a lot of walleye!
873927,bare foot wader,2014-09-24 22:56:00,1354,"a few measurements of the picture with some quick math and you'd get an accurate guess on length  beauty fish, the 6-7lb guess looks about right to me"
873934,Steve,2014-09-24 23:28:00,2075,i'd say 6-7lbs.
873972,Nipfisher,2014-09-25 02:41:00,2449,29 inches
873973,Nipfisher,2014-09-25 02:42:00,2449,take a measurement from your right shoulder to your left elbow and add on 5-7 ore inches.
874024,mike rousseau,2014-09-25 15:05:00,4661,"For anyone trying to ballpark a weight a trick I use that's pretty accurate is anything from 24"" up to about 30"" is about an inch a pound if they're a healthy looking fish...  24""= 4lbs 25""= 5lbs 26""= 6lbs 27""= 7lbs 28""= 8lbs 29""= 9lbs 30""= 10lbs  This is a guideline that is usually withing 0.5 of a pound...  If they're skinny take off 0.5-1 pound...  If it's December and they're obese... Add 0.5-1lb  So next time if you don't have a scale... Measure it... No tape measure then line it up on your rod... Or cut a piece of line the length of the fish and measure afterwords..."
874025,James77,2014-09-25 15:08:00,175,"Thanks guys, next time I will. It was a minute or so walk back to the cottage and I wanted to get this guy back quick. Next time I'll have a tape on me for it.  Thanks Mike, that's a cool tool to use.  James"
874026,mike rousseau,2014-09-25 15:11:00,4661,For everyone else... The I'm about the same size as James...  This walleye is 7lbs... And I'm holding it out  Fishing pictures suck when your a big dude...  
874037,Terry,2014-09-25 16:01:00,14456,it's always hard to tell how big they are in a photo       
874041,mike rousseau,2014-09-25 16:11:00,4661,I'm dizzy
874065,Spiel,2014-09-25 20:31:00,9065,"I'm curious to know how it dwarfed earlier fish of the stated 25"" if you didn't have a tape measure?  Nice fish though, extremely green in colouration."
874077,James77,2014-09-25 21:15:00,175,We would bring them up to check them to see if they were keepers or not. This one was clearly not a keeper size so there was no point in checking until afterwards when we wanted to know how big it was.
874089,chris.brock,2014-09-25 22:08:00,4053,"sounds like a hot spot  if you tell me where you caught it, I will try to recapture it and get a length and weight for you (smiley face)"
874092,James77,2014-09-25 22:28:00,175,I wish I could share this spot however there is already too much angling pressure as is. It's a small bay with 4 or 5 cottages on it and people casting in every direction. Can be a nightmare sometimes.
874098,Old Ironmaker,2014-09-25 23:46:00,8243,If you want to measure a fish without a tape hold the head to the tip of your finger and take note of where on your outstretched arm the tail sits. Then measure that distance when you can. A real hard core guy would tattoo measurements to the arm. For some guys that tell me they catch some real monsters they would have to tattoo increments to their legs or higher.
