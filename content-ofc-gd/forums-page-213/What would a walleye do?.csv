If the boat spooks an eye near a weededge off of deeper water, which way will the fish go?  Into the weeds or out to the deeper water?  Wondering if the rod is better out the shallow or deep side?  Nailed a 25 incher on a flat in 15 ft. with a perch taildancer.  10:30 am  2 mph"
873810,fishindevil,2014-09-24 06:23:00,6254,It depends but if want to get really good at trolling male the weed edge on GPS or drop a marker bouy down and get a decent trolling cob and run a offshore inline board right up to the weed edge and your boat will be 50 or so feet away and it will be hammer time !!!!! The walleye will not even know you are there !!!! You can also use this set up for trolling over shoals & humps !!!!! It's stealth mode and will increase your catch rate about 100% !!!!  Or you can position your boat a ways away and work the area with a bucktail if he is in the weeds or thou roughly cast the area with a jerkbait ... Many ways to achieve this !!!! Even just trolling walleyes will move away from the boat and if you have a inline running 50-75 feet away they will sometimes hammer it !!!! Pm me if you want .... Lots of options on this one ....
