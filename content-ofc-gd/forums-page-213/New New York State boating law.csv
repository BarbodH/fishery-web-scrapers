873762,Salmonidstalker,2014-09-23 23:19:00,265,"Effective May 1st, boat operators in NY need to take an approve boater education course. Not sure yet whether or not this applies to CDN boaters who frequent the Niagara River, but definitely something to look into if anyone is looking to drift the NY side of the river.  http://nysparks.com/recreation/boating/education.aspx  Is anyone aware if our pleasure raft operators card is a NASBLA approved course?"
873776,mike rousseau,2014-09-24 00:25:00,4661,I'd imagine we will be fine  That's like saying you need to get a NY drivers license to take a trip to NY city...

Edited to add: NYS also requires most boaters (I believe it's any boat under 26') to wear a approved PFD while the boat is under power (and that could mean your trolling motor) from Nov 1st to May 1st."
