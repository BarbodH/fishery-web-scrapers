874210,BillM,2014-09-26 22:03:00,17367,"looks like the guy that got hit was under the influence of marijuana at the time  THC can stay in your blood for weeks.   Even if the kid smoked a joint the night before, I'd hardly consider that being 'under the influence' 24hrs later.  The reason the kid is dead is because he got out of a perfectly safe race car, that was a bad bad decision."

The reason the kid is dead is because he got out of a perfectly safe race car, that was a bad bad decision. Exactly.. If anyone has ever smoked pot it could show in your blood 10 days later. Also i seriously doubt the kid got in a race car high..Even if he did the adrenalin would have most certainly killed off any sort of buzz..Tony has been cleared of any wrong doing, lets not make this any worse then it already is.."
874286,Tybo,2014-09-27 20:03:00,1373,^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^. Are you darn serious.
874328,danc,2014-09-28 02:41:00,4677,"Nobody will ever know exactly what happened here except Tony Stewart. Nobody. So Kevin Ward had had cannibus in his system? Big deal. I doubt he smoked just before the race because from my experience, it it a relaxer. It enhances ones feelings of happiness. God forbid that the law allows one to feel happy and relaxed, without going nuts or endangering others."
867042,DRIFTER_016,2014-08-11 02:05:00,10439,first car missed him  Only by a hair though. Could have just as easily been that car the hit the young fella.
867043,BillM,2014-08-11 02:11:00,17367, Only by a hair though. Could have just as easily been that car the hit the young fella.  Exactly my point.  It barely missed him and he had time to see him.   He moves out of the way and what's Tony supposed to do?
867044,moxie,2014-08-11 02:20:00,1566,"Tony ""The Murderer"" Stewart? That poor soul couldn't have chosen a worse ""Professional prick"" to tangle with and it unfortunately cost him his life. No Bumrap for Tony here. Just a Bum."
867058,Roe Bag,2014-08-11 11:07:00,246,"One thing to throw a helmet, wanna throw a punch, threaten to wreck someone, or kick an ass. But, deliberately run someone down with a racecar, REALLY???? Ward was dressed in black. Walks out in front of racecars on a dimly lit track. Barely missed by one and hit by another. What a surprise? Any change in direction of Stewart's car was more likely at the exact moment he saw Ward and hit the brakes. Too little, too late. Only those with a strong dislike for Tony would see it any other way."
867059,FloatnFly,2014-08-11 11:59:00,1640,"watch the video again and pay attention to the first car that goes by, then watch stewarts car, both cars did the exact same movement at the same point in the turn, stewarts was more exaggerated probably due to being a little higher up a banked corner.  also from watching the video, it doesn't even look like the 2 cars made contact that caused the wreck, looks like the other driven spun out trying to get space from stewart, and if thats the case, false accusations on his part.  but in the end, you'll never know the whole story until you see multiple angles of the incident."
867060,BillM,2014-08-11 12:22:00,17367,Don't forget Ward doesn't stop walking down the track either...   Dude should have stayed in his car.

867079,kickingfrog,2014-08-11 15:07:00,8333,Some realize the narrative would be completely different if the kid had hit the pro under the exact same conditions.
867082,Whitespinnerbait,2014-08-11 16:04:00,2038,Remember the part where your suppose to '' LOOK BOTH WAYS ''  before crossing the road.... Serious lack of judgement on Wards part !!!
867083,tb4me,2014-08-11 16:45:00,3295,"This should be interesting, to say the least..You can hear (what I think is tony)  Accelerate. If they can prove that it was his car the sped up he could be in trouble. Either way it was a bad move by both drivers and there is really no way you cal lay all the blame on Tony for this one...Mind you he is a professional driver and he knows how to handle a car..He could have missed him if he so choose..Remember this?"
867092,BillM,2014-08-11 17:31:00,17367,Here's a quote from a local guy I know on another forum...   
867141,Locnar,2014-08-12 00:54:00,645,"I don't think it was intentional in the least... It looks to me like the vehicle swerved due to hitting the guy. Those vehicles have crap for control on a dirt track... if the right tires hit something, then the vehicle will swerve in that direction."
867383,outllaw,2014-08-13 11:37:00,1232,"well now the other tapes surfaced,its shown the the internet mob mentality. yes a young man,s lost his life.a family lost a loved one..the many folks that want  mob justice can easily see thru technical things driving a sprint car.. I am certainly glad I waited to hear more actual,factors involved. just think tony stewart himself dealing with this. no I am not a tony fan. I am a fan of seeing the true facts... sure glad we don't have old western justice. wewoulda hung another innocent victim."
867751,206,2014-08-15 14:54:00,563,"I can't help but wonder if any other driver had of struck the guy down other then Stewart, would we have even heard about the incident?"
867756,Old Ironmaker,2014-08-15 15:31:00,8243,"If anyone here has ever participated in a sport like full contact hockey and football or had a job like a  combat soldier, even a steelworker or miner in the pre Health and Safety days, where adrenalin and other chemicals are bombarding the brain, heart rates hit above 140, muscles are spent and very little 02 is getting to the blood and brain, you will understand why people will unconsciously do crazy things. Like biting the ear off of another Boxer to something stupid like hammering your opponent over the head with a hockey stick in front of the referee and a national television audience. A pitcher throws a 97 MPH fastball at a batters head, if he hits the mark the batters career can be done, his life actually. If you have been in that state of body and mind you know what I mean. Those that haven't are called Monday morning quarterbacks.  I truly believe this might be another example of a person that may have been in that state of body and mind that turned tragi, I reiterate, might be..  I am not saying this was the case in this tragedy. I am saying people will do things unconsciously they would never normally do because they can not help it. For someone to say a pro would never put another in harms way doesn't know of what they speak because it happens with more regularity than you can imagine."
867805,misfish,2014-08-15 20:32:00,29133, Something like this/ A pro yes. DUMB move  
867810,Old Ironmaker,2014-08-15 20:57:00,8243,"Exactly Misfish, exactly. Maybe Bertuzzi didn't think anyone was watching. I remember the press conference where he was dabbing invisible tears from his eyes with a tissue, remember that, what a jackass."
867937,GbayGiant,2014-08-16 21:13:00,1780,Had full control of his car. Did a stupid maneuver by swinging his back end to hit him... which killed a person. He knows exactly what he did. End of story.
873993,FloatnFly,2014-09-25 11:30:00,1640,looks like the guy that got hit was under the influence of marijuana at the time
874034,Tim Mills,2014-09-25 15:49:00,476,How convenient for everybody...except the dead guy and his family.
874062,Whitespinnerbait,2014-09-25 20:25:00,2038,Its not Tony's fault the dead guy wanted to commit suicide !!
874103,Fisherman,2014-09-26 00:36:00,7201,"From the latest reports, the dead fellow shouldn't have even been driving, under the influence of weed."
874106,Old Ironmaker,2014-09-26 00:54:00,8243,The family will be filing a wrongful death suit against Stewart and everyone connected to that race based on what the family was quoted as saying today. They contend Steward did intentionally end the kids life. Much easier to prove in civil court down there. As did the Brown family's successful civil suit against OJ. If Tony Stewart moves to Florida he knows it's coming too.
874107,leaf4,2014-09-26 01:06:00,2466,"I think they have 0 case in court on account of him being high, who knows though"
866984,darsky,2014-08-10 19:05:00,586,"I watched it many times and I am yet to see a replay that shows him turn intentionally toward the other guy. Those ""vehicles"" have sketchy control AT BEST. The contact looked minimal that sent him into the wall AND to wait and then run out towards Stewart amongst the flow at full speed.........?  Tragic-yes, but against everything a driver should do after a crash."
866985,misfish,2014-08-10 19:12:00,29133,"I have watched it over and over as well. Disturbing.  Watch the first car. Straight through. Tony swerved. Im not saying he did it on purpose. But you can see he went up.   A very sad day.  Drivers in any race,,should just stay put.  Added note,Tony is a loose canon these days. Everytime he gets wrecked or causes one,he looks to blame others."
866986,misfish,2014-08-10 19:17:00,29133,At 36 sec. He goes up   Front tires dont lie. IMO.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d0F9VRz0sn0
866987,Joey,2014-08-10 19:27:00,9122,"Well I'm speechless.  I just watched it several times and I don't think he hit him intentionally.   Even though you all know Tony is my guy, those cars are not easy to control. Why would he get out on a dark racetrack and confront a vehicle?"
866991,misfish,2014-08-10 19:37:00,29133,"I know that J.  He,s done the same.       https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqHJeDuuPA"

866994,Spanky80,2014-08-10 19:50:00,152,"I couldn't believe it when I first heard this morning...I know that Tony is a loose cannon, but when I watched the video I don't know what to think.  The driver that left his sprint car to confront the 14 was wearing dark clothes, the track wasn't very well lit, and the car in front of Tony came close to him as well and Tony wasn't far behind him.  Did Tony see him at the last minute (and try to throttle-steer - the way these things are driven - away from him)?  Misfish is right in that he does seem to turn UP the track and possibly blast Ward with dirt...maybe that was his intent?  I find it very hard to believe he would intentionally try to hit Ward.  Not sure what to think at this point..."
866995,misfish,2014-08-10 19:55:00,29133,  I agree.  My points are made from watching the video.
866996,darsky,2014-08-10 20:02:00,586,looks to me like he jammed on the brakes and his car started to swerve. Its what happens.
866999,Rodbender,2014-08-10 20:13:00,1027,Nothing below him and he runs up the track yea that's murder

867007,fishingwithbob,2014-08-10 21:46:00,123,"Yup, just making the point that crap happens, kid should have settled it after the race.  He paid for his hot head.  Watched the video a number of times and I can't see where Tony steered towards him, his tires turn after the impact."
867011,Tim Mills,2014-08-10 22:33:00,476,Google dead spin and read the comments from Tyler Graves a race driver who was in the stands.  The first cars are easily able to avoid the victim but one of the best drivers in the world is not?  Victim at fault too should have left it for the pits.  it will be interesting to see how this plays out in court.

Stewart is a professional driver, if they are expected to control a car at 100 mph plus, he can definitely control it at caution speed.  I have seen him race dirt cars at Ohsweken a few times, he knows what he is doing in one of those cars, no doubt about it.  Sad day in motorsports, good thing Tony can afford a good lawyer because I think hes going to need it.  My heart goes out to Kevin Ward Jr family and friends"
867039,206,2014-08-11 01:55:00,563,"I'm waiting to see it from another angle....First instinct was he throttles it to strike him, my human nature says he throttled it to swing the rear tire away from him. Can't wait to see how this pans out.  It's nothing a few million can't smooth over (How Sad is that?)"

Also it doesn't matter how well the track is lit, no one has any idea what Tony could and could not see.   That kid just kept on walking down the track, first car missed him, Tony didn't."
