873279,Regan Thompson,2014-09-20 03:23:00,80,"My Muskie Buddies from the south sent me this.  Great classification guide for different sized Muskies!  I think this could definitely catch on, Let me know what you think... "
873281,lew,2014-09-20 10:51:00,12766,As an ex Navy guy I've always liked the big ships and have been all the way to a Super Carrier but have yet to board a Dreadnaught
873283,creditmaster,2014-09-20 11:01:00,190,i like it
873305,Tom McCutcheon,2014-09-20 13:53:00,627,I'm with Lew on this one also. Have managed everything from Scout to Supercarrier and am patiently waiting to board a Dreadnaught
873314,Fisherpete,2014-09-20 15:32:00,1814,Hahaha I like it  Andrew's first and only 50+ happened to be a dreadnaught! Guess he was a star soldier and jumped ranks! I'm now in the battleship class.
873316,leaf4,2014-09-20 15:42:00,2466,Well I guess I'm still in a corvette for now.... vroom vroom!
873317,Gregoire,2014-09-20 15:45:00,1397,Cruisers are kind of fun right?
873318,mike rousseau,2014-09-20 16:01:00,4661,Same rank here sir...
873319,Rich Clemens,2014-09-20 16:05:00,3131,I guess in am just cruising along - at least for on other 9 months
873569,Heiny,2014-09-22 17:10:00,3,Ol' Thompy!
873579,AKRISONER,2014-09-22 18:12:00,5558,underscout
873582,Slimeball,2014-09-22 19:26:00,30,"Like Lew, I am ex Navy also. I like the list too, but technically it is incorrect as far as size progression goes. World War 2 era Battleships ( USS Wisconsin ) were much larger than WW1 era Dreadnoughts ( HMS Dreadnought ) Supercarrier should top the list."
873586,aplumma,2014-09-22 19:57:00,6896,Ummmm I scored a rubber ducky in the bathtub still.....   Art
873610,moxie,2014-09-22 22:13:00,1566,Like the classification list. In the two seasons we targeted them specifically only managed to boat up to the Cruiser Class of Ski fishing limited waters.

873986,Old Ironmaker,2014-09-25 08:00:00,8243,l'll take a PT boat if it means I caught a Musky.
