Anyone know where I can find a depth chart it's not on my navionics. It's on mine. Navionics Gold and it's 5 or 6 years old. Was on Leonard Lake last summer with the grandkids. Small easy to navigate but some shoals and boulders that you need to watch out for. Public launch is a nightmare, you need to reverse down a narrow lane maybe 150 metres as there is nowhere to turn around at the bottom. There is a pretty big shoal just out from the launch that you need to give a wide berth. Water is only 3' until you get out a ways. Mainly smallies, but it's stocked with rainbows and the odd walleye. Good luck.."
