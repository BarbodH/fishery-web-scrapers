873458,fisherman7,2014-09-21 22:37:00,325,"Hi there, going to spend next Friday and Saturday running around these lakes checking waterfront properties. I doubt we'll have a spare minute but if we do I'd appreciate some advise on lure type and colour for bass or walleye. Not expecting anyone to give up hot spots or anything. Just like to have a fighting chance. The wife will be with me so the pressure will be on if we get a chance to wet a line.  Thanks all!"
873479,James77,2014-09-22 01:31:00,175,For me nothing works as well as the rapala flat rap 10cm in perch! G ood luck.
873481,fishdawg,2014-09-22 01:56:00,912,"If time is limited, pack light and easy... A jig n grub to cast along weed lines,"
873515,jimmer,2014-09-22 13:37:00,2730,"Tough time of the year for fishing those lakes. Stay close to milfoil and use twisters, wacky rigs, flipping jigs right into the thickest part of the weeds or a texas rigged worm."
873543,AKRISONER,2014-09-22 15:28:00,5558,"try the pigeon side of the bridge at buckhorn. It seems to always bee doing, good mix of structure, weeds, deep spots and rocks.  I hear fishing is tough this time of year on em though, but this warm hold out might help."
873583,Sinker,2014-09-22 19:28:00,8692,You have a boat?  S.
873673,fisherman7,2014-09-23 11:42:00,325,"You have a boat?  S. yes, we'll have a 14' with a 9.9"
873677,lew,2014-09-23 12:19:00,12766,"yes, we'll have a 14' with a 9.9  You've got an awful lot of water to cover with a 14' & 9.9,  hope you've got a game plan LOL"
873686,I'mHooked,2014-09-23 13:35:00,525,"Don't discount dragging a crank bait behind you if you're cruising slowly along weed edges near shore. If you've at least got a bait in the water, while you're checking places out, keep an eye out for weed lines as well and something may just dart out and nail it."
873795,captpierre,2014-09-24 01:46:00,2521,"Yup.  Trolling a Taildancer in perch caught me a 25 inch eye this morning on Pigeon in 15 ft.  Was looking for a feed but alas, chicken tonight....again."
873885,fisherman7,2014-09-24 19:33:00,325," You've got an awful lot of water to cover with a 14' & 9.9,  hope you've got a game plan LOL WOT, wife strapped in, holding on tight to the dog!"
873970,Regan Thompson,2014-09-25 02:23:00,80,"When I lived on Chemong, my neighbor Doug (old guy (and they always know the best)), used to swear by those Rapala minnow countdown lures.  The ones that don't float (i.e. the countdown) and ~3"" in size.  Reason being when you're trolling slow you need the bait to get down deep enough (8-12 feet in the Kawarthas) and they would just hit the sweet spot!  Sure enough they worked!  Good luck and have fun"
