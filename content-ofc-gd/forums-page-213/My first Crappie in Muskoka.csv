I've never caught one before, I was drifting a plastic leach across the bottom in 30 feet.  Not my thing but I was kind of impressed by the size of it.  It was released I hear they are good eating but not really into that.  No pickerel found lol  "

I just fish for fun.  I eat fish occasionally but don't care for them enough to kill em.  Minority opinion around here I know, just personal choice.  It was pretty big, I didn't weigh or measure it... It's swim bladder was coming out its mouth so I put it back fast as I pulled it out.  Swam straight down so hopefully it's there for the next guy!"
