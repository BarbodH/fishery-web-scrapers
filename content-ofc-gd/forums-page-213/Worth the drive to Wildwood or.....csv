871767,Can_38,2014-09-10 18:35:00,152,Trying to accommodate a friend and have semi agreed to meet and fish the Wildwood reservoir in St.Marys.  Not exactly my first choice but if any members can provide any feedback or alternate suggestions within a hour drive of London I would appreciate it.
871812,scugpg,2014-09-10 20:44:00,1373,Wildwood is likely the easiest option for pike and bass in the area especially by boat. Hard to say what the water level and quality is like with all the rain and you should check of they have started the fall drain yet.
871855,mcdougy,2014-09-11 00:29:00,274,It's got water. Plan on enjoying the day of company with your friend. If your wanting more serious fishing..... LSC  is about 1.25 hours away.
871859,i2cool2fool,2014-09-11 00:54:00,349,"I am not sure of your situation (what fish you want to target or size of boat you have if any) but I'd suggest you go perch fishing out of Port Bruce.  An hour drive and you are likely fishing within another 30 mins more (providing you have the right gear - boat, setup).  1.5 hours you are at launch in Long Point inner bay else likely Lake St. Clair.  Wildwood just isn't worth the $25 entry fee for me to fishing such a pressured body of water and typically large amount of boat traffic if its a nice day.  If you do go to Wildwood, pike and bass are in there. Work for them. I docked there for 3 years when I first became a boat owner. My relic boat at the time and unseasoned boating skills matched well for the water.  Hopefully this is helpful. Tight lines and fair winds."

Launching my 16' Legend SC and prefer to target SMB and LMB with the odd accidental Pike.  Wishful thinking the water will not be over busy mid / late September."

If you only have a few hours to get away, Wildwood is certainly an option.  Whatever you choose, it would be great to hear how you make out. We like pictures and whooper of a fishing story. True or not."
873505,Can_38,2014-09-22 12:59:00,152,"Tough morning with not a single nibble between 6:45 and noon.  Finally found some rock structure and landed 7 LMB and SMB in the 2-3lb range.  Persistence paid off once again  Good company, conversation and finally fish.    Need to reduce file size on a few more pics. "

873662,Canuck2fan,2014-09-23 02:35:00,1444,Good work... I am impressed there are still fish in there with the pressure it gets.
