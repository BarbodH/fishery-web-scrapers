On this abnormally hot day (28 degrees), a couple of friends and I got on the water as soon as we could and went to work.  The day started slow but we kept working and landed this nice 53"".  She spit out the bait almost before we netted her so much thanks to Craig for an excellent netting job...  After a few pics from the flashing black box and a quick measurement, she was back in the water and on her way like nothing happened.  What a gorgeous fish! "
