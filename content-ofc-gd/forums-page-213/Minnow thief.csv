873332,knightfisher,2014-09-20 17:31:00,237,I love fishing the upper Niagara. You never know what you may catch or see. This is one brave mink to say the least. Caught a number of smallies including this 3.5 bass. 
873339,mike rousseau,2014-09-20 17:49:00,4661,Out cottage area was infested with them for a few years....  We had a tank that was 3.5'x5' and about 3' deep for minnows... One night I went fishing and put my catch of 4 walleye in the tank LIVE to clean in the morning...  When I got up they were all gone and there were little mink tracks all over the tank... One of the walleye was pushing 5lbs... Couldn't believe they could catch and kill a fish that big...  Another time I was dropping off my buddy on shore cause he has to go to work... He made 2 trips to his truck... First for tackle and second for fish... When he returned for the fish his entire stringer was bouncing across the rocks with a mink leading the way... Lol

We were trolling for muskies in front of that bridge behind you one December morning a few years back when the water boiled up underneath us and spun our boat 180 degrees.  Don't think anything ever got my attention as fast as that before or since LOL

873577,knightfisher,2014-09-22 18:00:00,237,"That's amazing Mike, determined little things for sure.  Lew what you experienced there was the effects of the Thompson's hole. It starts around the Peace bridge down to around the train bridge. The waters around the hole average about 12 feet. The hole drops fast 45 to 60 feet, hence the boiling waters at times. Your experience probably gave you a grey hair or two lol.  "
