873541,SmokestackLightnin,2014-09-22 15:21:00,390,Just picked up a Garmin GPSmap 62S from Kijiji Boutique and would like to load some maps.  I would be using this in Ontario for hunting and also on my ATV while ice fishing back lakes.  I am looking for advice on the use of the unit as well as suggested maps to download.
873552,BillM,2014-09-22 16:16:00,17367,It should have a pretty good basemap on it already (Topo v4 if I'm not mistaken)
873584,SirCranksalot,2014-09-22 19:42:00,3291,If you want topos try Ibycus.  Their users manual might make a good fire starter. Otherwise it's pretty useless. You'll just have to learn to use it by trial and error. the interface is user hostile. One of these days someone like Apple is going to get int the GPS business and blow the likes of garmin clean out of the water..
873585,porkpie,2014-09-22 19:57:00,2521,A second vote for Ibycus. It's freeware and it is pretty good!
873587,vance,2014-09-22 19:58:00,719,if you want to use it for snowmobile trails or atv trails get the Backroads ontario map. Its not cheap  $150 but it has trails on there from the 1930's onward.I use it on my atv and for the most part it is deadly accurate.   vance

Not sure where they, or Garmin, get off charging such exorbitant prices when the topo info is provided free by the Cdn gov't(for private citizens at least---maybe companies have to pay a small fee) Wow---that rant felt good!!"

873960,pics,2014-09-25 00:48:00,1268,I bought the topo version 4.. while I would have liked to get the backroads mapbook I decided too late on which to get.. not a lot of stores carry the backroads maps and I need it this week for the moose hunt.. ibycus seems like a huge pain to download but you can order the dvd for $25 I believe.. load it to your computer and then pick the maps you want on the gps..
873961,pics,2014-09-25 00:48:00,1268,The gps you have is a good unit too
