873665,pidge,2014-09-23 02:50:00,438,"Hey Newfi have you checked Walmart? Not sure what your looking for, but I recall in a recent flyer seeing some camo clothes they had. Can't remember what it was exactly now, but I remember saying to myself ""that's odd of them"" maybe checker out. Walmart online to save the drive out.  Pidge"
873683,nancur373,2014-09-23 13:16:00,1211,Thanks pidge. I'll check it out.
873768,pidge,2014-09-23 23:57:00,438,"Just a note. Just seen a ad in the bass pro flyer that they had the camo gear section. They labeled ""kids"" as well. Might be worth a shot??"
873818,glenner,2014-09-24 11:10:00,56,Cabela's has a full range of camo clothing in kid's sizes. Heck they even have wispy camo underthings for the missus (or whoever).
873829,Sinker,2014-09-24 13:51:00,8692,"The problem with kids camo, is they grow out of it so fast, and its not cheap!  I know I have to buy my son new camo every fall, because he outgrows it in a year.  I have some stuff here for ya, I'll dig it out tonight and see what exactly I have.  S."
873833,Thrilla,2014-09-24 14:26:00,164,Check out wing supply Cheap stuff but they will grow out of it in no time. I ordered for 3 boys and it was cheap
873839,muddler,2014-09-24 15:26:00,623,Giant Tiger has some for kids and adult. Very reasonable prices.  muddler
873841,Rustic-Fisher,2014-09-24 15:36:00,826,TSC if where I snagged some for the boy.
873853,Tim Mills,2014-09-24 16:49:00,476,There was some on Kijiji today.  Not sure if its near you but it may be worth a look.
873871,nancur373,2014-09-24 18:28:00,1211,"Thanks everyone for suggestions. Thanks Sinker, I'll see you soon. I got three boys and a girl so going new at BPS, Cabelas, etc. is pretty much a no no. lol"
873997,glenner,2014-09-25 12:04:00,56,"Ya, I can see where buying new for that many kids, and then they outgrow it so fast would be awfully expensive !"
