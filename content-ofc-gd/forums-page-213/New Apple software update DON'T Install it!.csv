874200,Big Cliff,2014-09-26 20:47:00,6899,"Well, lesson learned I won't b installing any more Apple updates until they have been out for a few weeks!  I have to be honest with u, I do have some issues and I'm not too impressed with their technical support but the phones and such are very user friendly. For reliability though my Blackberry beats the IPhone hands down! In fact my son works way back in the bush in MB. His IPhone wouldn't work. My old Blackberry works perfectly!"
874335,danc,2014-09-28 03:37:00,4677,Updated without a problem here. But the wifes 4 month old samsung adroid needs a new battery.
874069,Big Cliff,2014-09-25 20:42:00,6899,"Wife comes to me with her Ipad Mini this morning (that was her first mistake) She has a notification that there is a new software update, so I hit install (second mistake). That went well but then her Iphone wouldn't sync with her Ipad because they were using different software.  Smart me, no problem, checked for updates on her Iphone and sure enough it is available. HOWEVER...... you can't install it on the 4s because it requires 4.6 GB (phone only has 5 GB out of the box). Head off to the Virgin Mobile store here in Lindsay where we bought the phones (third mistake). After waiting for a good 20 minutes to get to talk to someone we were told that there is a problem with the new update and it is using too much memory, DON'T INSTALL IT!!!! Then they told me I'd have to uninstall the update on the Ipad. When I asked for help I was told ""call 1-800 my apple"".  Then I explained that the Iphone and Ipad wouldn't sync properly prior to this; ""call 1-800 my apple"".!  Then I explained that ever since we got these new Iphones we had been having problems with dropped calls when at home but we never had a problem with our Blackberries ""call 1-800 my apple"".!  I walked before I got to 10 I'd be typing this on my phone from a jail cell!  So, don't install the new update and if you are looking for service on an Apple Product don't go to the Virgin Mobile store in Lindsay, they might sell Apple products but they don't service them or offer any help with them other than ""call 1-800 my apple""!"

874074,Ben_Daniels,2014-09-25 20:57:00,435,"Hey Cliff,  If you have it plugged into the computer and download the updates through iTunes it takes a lot less memory, I think its like 1gb or something."
874076,aplumma,2014-09-25 21:14:00,6896,I am sorry to say this but the phone stores are not allowed to service or advise on the apple products. If you have an issue you have to schedule an appointment at an apple service center to get help. A good friend of mine owns an AT T store and this is the route I had to go thru when my I5 had an issue on the last update after he expended all of his knowledge he personally knew about the product.

From what I got from today was ""DON""T INSTALL IT, THERE ARE PROBLEMS WITH IT"".  So, do as you will but be careful! I only wish someone had warned me before this morning!"

874124,Craigson,2014-09-26 11:06:00,117,"Sorry but its not Apples failt that update doesnt work for a 4 yr old phone. Iphones rock, easy to use,  PS dropping calls is ur carriers issue, not the phone"
874130,Big Cliff,2014-09-26 11:54:00,6899,"Sorry but its not Apples failt that update doesnt work for a 4 yr old phone. Iphones rock, easy to use,  PS dropping calls is ur carriers issue, not the phone Bull spit! Phones aren't even a year old, just bought them in Jan. this year.  Carrier is Virgin Mobile, been with them for years, never had a problem when I had the Blackberry but since we got the Iphones tons of problems with dropped calls here at the house, can't ever remember having one with the Blackberry.  Don't get me wrong; Iphones are much easier to use, wife loves her Ipad Mini, but when Apple releases an up grade that is obviously flawed and doesn't warn people that there is a problem they are not doing their job!  Oh, and just try calling 1-800 my apple right now and see how long it takes you to get to talk to someone. Seems we are not the only people having a problem with the new update. Now that's customer service for you!"

874134,Rod Caster,2014-09-26 12:05:00,5784,"We got a company wide email saying 'DO NOT INSTALL'. Serious issues with email.  They just took my Blackberry Z10 and gave me a 5C. I usually don't care much about technology, but this phone drives me nuts and I think I had a dream last night that I smashed the crap out of it.  There are so many little problems with it, including the privacy issues, which is why I don't have the App Store or iTunes because they want my address, birthday, phone number, 5 security passwords. It won't send messages to my Jeep (well sometimes, but not always ??),  can't turn off a lot of the noises, editing emails is brutal, camera sucks etc etc.  I trusted my Blackberry and liked the way it handled like a work phone. I might be the first person in the company to actually buy my own and put it on the work plan."
874138,Big Cliff,2014-09-26 12:44:00,6899,"I loved my Blackberry but Sue hated hers so instead of having two different phones I got us  matching phones so that if she had a problem I could help her with it. Now we both have the same problems LOL. Oh well that what love does, we suffer together."

I know that many of you have integrated these devises in your every day lives, some to the point of being completely non functional without your device. I get a good laugh at folks lining up for hours to pay $1k to make a phone call or send a text. We have a number of Apple products here in the house, none of which hold any interest to me. I simply refuse to allow technology to dictate how I live my life. NOW GET OFF MY LAWN!!!!!!! HH"

My wife has a Samsung HEMAROID biggest pain and piece of junk she's ever owned.

Add to that, the battery life was awful.  That being said, I never do apple updates until the platform has been out for 3 months. Keeps me sane!"
