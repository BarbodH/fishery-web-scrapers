873474,fishindevil,2014-09-22 00:40:00,6254,Well just a quick report and a nice smallie !!! Fished another full day in the pouring rain and still getting lots of very nice smallies !!! Here is one of the better ones from yesterday !!! Spinnerbait & jerkbait still the go to baits for sure !!!
873475,Tim Mills,2014-09-22 01:03:00,476,Nice looking fish.
873476,chris.brock,2014-09-22 01:03:00,4053,"nice Shawn, putting fish in the boat, as usual  I miss it up there"
873486,Fishinbum,2014-09-22 02:42:00,9,Nice I love cold wwather small mouth fishin. often slowing down is difficult after fishin all summer but i find a slow presentation will trigger just as many big hits. I switch to the livetarget baitball cranks and twister tail amd tube jigs with 1/8 oz for the fall smallmouth.  Slow and deliberate presentation with slow small movements..
873488,Dan668,2014-09-22 03:00:00,1120,"Nice. I landed a 5lb smallie today on a spinnerbait. We were on pigeon,  fun day in the rain."

873509,AKRISONER,2014-09-22 13:13:00,5558,nice piggy  sad I wasnt up on GB this weekend!  Pigeon and buckhorn hold some nice piggies for sure.
873514,manjo39,2014-09-22 13:35:00,354,"Thanks for the report fishndevil.  I wasn't able to make it up to 'the lake' last weekend, but the weather pattern looked really good for the weekend.  Stable all week and Sunday was the last day before the cold front.  Looks like you used a swammer as the trailer.  Good idea!  Only ever used twister tails.  Will give my swammer's a go."
