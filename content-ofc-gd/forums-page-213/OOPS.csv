873499,lew,2014-09-22 12:53:00,12766,"I have a tool bar that's normally at the bottom of my screen, but for some reason it suddenly moved and now runs vertical on the right side of my screen.  Been messing around for 10 minutes trying to get it back on the bottom but I'm a definite computer dunce and can't figure it out.  Help please"
873500,mike rousseau,2014-09-22 12:54:00,4661,I think you can click on it with your mouse and simply drag it to the bottom of your screen Lew
873501,Spiel,2014-09-22 12:55:00,9065,You should just be able to click on it and drag it to the bottom of the screen Lew.
873502,Spiel,2014-09-22 12:56:00,9065,I really need to learn to type faster....LOL
873503,Wagoneer,2014-09-22 12:57:00,118,"You might have to unlock it first. Right click on the toolbar and look for an option that has a check beside that says ""unlock toolbar"". Once it's unlocked you should be able to left click on it and drag it to the bottom of the screen and then lock it again so it doesn't happen again."
873504,Joey,2014-09-22 12:59:00,9122,"Aren't computers a pain sometimes Lew.  I have my photos in a file and for some reason, I hit something and it moved them and now when I download, I can't find them.   It's driving me nuts.   I may need to call Computer Geeks.com to help me, or get my son up here to help.  Hope you figure it out bud."
873506,lew,2014-09-22 13:01:00,12766,"Thanks folks, your a good group, dragging it down was the answer.  Hope you get your issue fixed as easy as mine was Joey."

Just check where you're sending downloaded files when the download bar is up."
873511,lew,2014-09-22 13:25:00,12766,"Thanks Wagoneer, the shift happened when I was looking at GOOGLE maps and then closed it.  As the wise man once said, ""darned thing never did that before"""
873512,Walleye72,2014-09-22 13:27:00,156,"Wow, problem solved in under 5 minutes Lew.  Way to go.  What browser are you using Joey?"
873525,misfish,2014-09-22 14:02:00,29133,  I think Terry thought that one up.
873529,Joey,2014-09-22 14:18:00,9122,"I use Google Chrome, but download the pics to Windows Live Photo Gallery.  Then normally, it would have all the names on the left hand side that i called the file, like ""heron"" or ""nipissing"" or the date but now the names on the left hand side are no longer there, it just says downloads;, and I look and they're not there.  I have a heck of a time finding them when before it was so easy.   Don't know what I hit but it changed it and I want it to change back"
873530,BillM,2014-09-22 14:25:00,17367,"Joey, I bet you simply minimized the pane on the left hand side of the screen when opening the Photo Gallery.  Put your mouse over the left hand size and see if it turns into two horizontal arrows, if it does, left click and drag it back to the right.  That should give you your folder listings back."
873532,Joey,2014-09-22 14:43:00,9122,"SWEET, that worked, thanks Bill.  So we solved two computer problems today within an hour.   Such a smart bunch us fishermen we are  thanks Bill!"
873533,misfish,2014-09-22 14:45:00,29133,Awesome J  I just signed up there. Lets see how long it takes me to screw it up.LOL
873535,lew,2014-09-22 14:50:00,12766,Good to hear your back in business too Joey
873537,BillM,2014-09-22 14:53:00,17367,"SWEET, that worked, thanks Bill.  So we solved two computer problems today within an hour.   Such a smart bunch us fishermen we are  thanks Bill!  Glad you got it figured out."
