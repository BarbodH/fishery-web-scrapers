870166,misfish,2014-08-31 17:36:00,29133,"I'm pretty thrifty, my wife says cheap  but I find Trilene XT 10lb works good if your a Wallis caster , a limper line like XL if you side cast  I need someone to teach me the Wallis cast.. I see guys doing it on the river. it looks so effortless. Not for me though. I always find myself trying to get the back lash untangled."
870170,BillM,2014-08-31 17:38:00,17367,"Sidecasting is a lot less effortless, lol.   There's also the spinning side cast which a buddy of mine does.  Wallis cast does help reduce line twist however (Although I think most of it is from the float spinning, not the casting itself IMO)"
870217,FloatnFly,2014-09-01 00:14:00,1640,surprised no one recommended drennan......

870263,BillM,2014-09-01 13:15:00,17367,surprised no one recommended drennan......  Drennan Super Specialist Super mono is great stuff.   I've got a few spools of 8lb I'll use in the winter.
870292,tbaltovski,2014-09-01 16:26:00,38,"Which fireline do you guys use? Original, crystal or tracer?  I got a spool of 10lbs nanofil but it seems like overkill not that I know everyone seems to use 6lbs."
870341,porkpie,2014-09-01 21:04:00,2521,"I use 10lb nano on all my pickerel rods, with an 8lb fluoro leader.  I can't see it as being overkill for steelhead!  I use 10lb trilene xl on all of my float reels as mainline, and have for many years.  I use 30lb powerpro on a diawa 1300 with a 10-15lb mono lead the occasional time I fish salmon in the river systems.  The key is your leader.  With the advent of fluoro, I haven't used less than 6lb test leader in years, even in clear water.  Long gone are the days of 2lb leads and 20 minute battles, now unless it's a really good fish or really fast water (and my home rivers are GB/Huron) I just hoist fish up on the bank LOL."

I got a spool of 10lbs nanofil but it seems like overkill not that I know everyone seems to use 6lbs.  Fireline Crystal.  10lb Nano will be fine.  I like 6lb because it's the diameter of dental floss and casts a mile."
874109,tbaltovski,2014-09-26 02:15:00,38,Thanks BIll.  I think I will try the nano till it gets cold.  Is 150 yards enough?

I usually use 12-15lb mono for backing then dacron or something else if I've gotta fill a really deep spool.  (Both the spools on my Frogwater and Demarco aren't super deep for just mono works fine)"

869838,creditmaster,2014-08-28 17:49:00,190,hey guys im wondering if I should trade my mono for furocarbon on my centerpin for steelhead? what atre the adwantages ? and also what line do u recommend for fly fishing for steelhead?
869845,BillM,2014-08-28 18:32:00,17367,"No, that would be awful.   I like braid, Nanofil or Fireline....  If you don't want to run a super line, stick to mono."
869846,DOS,2014-08-28 18:34:00,119,"JMO leave your mainline mono because it floats, flouro below the swivel only.  I know guys that run braid or Nano for their mainline but they float also, flouro does not."
869847,DOS,2014-08-28 18:35:00,119,"damn bill, ya beat me..."
869850,BillM,2014-08-28 18:41:00,17367,"damn bill, ya beat me...  Great minds think a like!"
869877,misfish,2014-08-28 20:56:00,29133,"I will be trying the nano this fall for the first time. I,m a Raven hi vis guy. My peeps are not the best,thats why I use it. My leads are floro.   I should be able to see the nano white line. Unless in fishing in a snow blizzard.LOL"
869890,Ralph Field,2014-08-28 22:04:00,1018,"Nano now comes in high vis yellow, but I don't know how well the colour lasts. I use fireline crystal and on my other reels I use mono. You can't use nano in below freezing conditions. As others have stated stay away from fluro for mainline."
869959,misfish,2014-08-29 10:13:00,29133,  Nice. Bring on the snow blizzard.LOL
869960,Garnet,2014-08-29 11:03:00,2056,I use co polymer P Line. Mono starts the day floating then absorbs water and sinks.  Co polymer line is in between mono and flouro so doesn't sink and doesn't float. Then I treat my line with Blackmore Reel Magic that makes it float and also slows down icing. Co polymer line has way less stretch than mono.  Just to say something nice about Cabelas only place I've seen P Line resently. I use P Line CXX mose green so I can see the line a little.
869963,cuzza,2014-08-29 11:31:00,467,"I use Nanofil on my 'pin but use a shot line, first outing I tried without and it was a mess!!  For the fly side (assuming single hand), I use a steelhead taper line on my 8wt but pretty much any WFF line will work for nymphing, if you mean leaders/tippets, I use mono leaders (normally no need for tapered) with flurocarbon tippet, usually 6/8lb"
869964,BillM,2014-08-29 11:32:00,17367,"Yeah, you gotta use a shot line with Nano or any braid..."
869967,porkpie,2014-08-29 11:43:00,2521,"I've been using mono for 25 years, and see no reason to change.  If you must go with the latest and greatest, by all means do so, but don't bother using fluoro.  A buddy of mine had that brilliant idea a few years ago (god only knows why) and it was terrible.  Fluoro is wonderful leader material, but crap for a mainline on a float reel.  I have tried superlines, and love nano for spinning rigs etc, but my float rigs have remained mono, and will continue to be.  The nessecity of shot lines and the like are more invconvenient than the limited benefits of superline.  I don't use hi vis either.  If you can see your float, you should know where your line is.  And if you can't see your float, your drifting to far!  I have also never had much trouble with hooksets with mono, and I don't require the ""feel"" of superline as I'm using an indicator!  I like trilene XL as a mainline myself.  Good luck!"
869968,BillM,2014-08-29 11:51:00,17367,"The casting distance I get with 6lb Nano over anything else is pretty nutty.   It's like night and day.  Now if you're fishing east ditches, then casting distance really doesn't matter.  But say the Geen and bigger tribs?   It can make or break your day.  Only thing I really dislike about Nano is the fact that ice in your guides will rip it to shreds..   Other then that, I don't see any downfalls. (Sans maybe the price).  Too many positives to ignore.  Also those hero hooksets are a lot of fun  :)  I do spool up with Drennan Super Specialist or Fireline Crystal once the cold weather and ice get here, for a mono it's good stuff."
870081,creditmaster,2014-08-30 17:51:00,190,thanks guys i geuse its back to cabelas for  some braid.? hows my  reel and rod combo ?daiwa acculite rod and shimano sonora for a reel? with 20 lbs mono ? will this suffise for coho and small chinnok?
870093,BillM,2014-08-30 19:12:00,17367,"thanks guys i geuse its back to cabelas for  some braid.? hows my  reel and rod combo ?daiwa acculite rod and shimano sonora for a reel? with 20 lbs mono ? will this suffise for coho and small chinnok?  I think we all assumed you were using a centerpin.   Ditch the 20lb mono, that on a spinning reel will be a handful.   I'd probably load up with 6lb Fireline Crystal and be done with it."
870124,creditmaster,2014-08-31 12:50:00,190,why so light line?
870126,Ryan Landry,2014-08-31 12:59:00,128,6lb is perfect if you're using 3lb leader!
870127,Ralph Field,2014-08-31 13:00:00,1018,6 lb. fireline is stronger than it's rating and will cast better than thicker lines.
870128,Ryan Landry,2014-08-31 13:00:00,128,I run a 10 or 12lb main line so I can go as high as 8lb leader without ever loosing any floats.
870131,creditmaster,2014-08-31 13:07:00,190,really? for steelhead and salmon?
870142,Ryan Landry,2014-08-31 14:28:00,128,
870145,creditmaster,2014-08-31 14:50:00,190,what do u recomend?
870150,BillM,2014-08-31 15:27:00,17367,"I agree, seems a little light. I like my fish to be alive when I land em!  6lb Fireline is stronger then what you're using    I run 5.6# or 6.6# leader, no floaters battles are over quick."
870159,creditmaster,2014-08-31 16:19:00,190,ok thanks
