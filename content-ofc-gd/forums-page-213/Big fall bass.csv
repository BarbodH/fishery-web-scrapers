Had to get the kids on the bus, so didn't get on the water until after 9.  Still managed 8 nice bass.  I was up 6-0 on my FIL until he nailed an absolute monster bass....didn't have a scale but it was a good, honest 5 pounder.  Just a hawg.  I managed a few nice ones too in the 2-3 pound range.  All caught on senkos, drop shots, or blade runners.  "
