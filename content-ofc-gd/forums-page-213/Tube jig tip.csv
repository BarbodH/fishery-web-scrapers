But  after a while the top of the tube rips or when you set the hook and miss the fish or it is on rock or branch the tube will fall down ,,anyway seen the foam earplugs at work ,grabbed a handful  ,,,these are the kind you squeeze and then they expand after a short period of time. Put one in my tube loaded with scent ...and I could not believe how long the tube lasted and did not pull down with my missed hook sets ,,,,,a little tip to help the tube guys I'm sure you can buy these plugs pretty cheap at the hardware store"

874305,Old Ironmaker,2014-09-28 00:18:00,8243,That is a good tip. I use tubes and love them. Try stuffing a piece of Alka Seltzer up the tube. Makes little CO2 bubbles and when nothing seems to work the Smallies turn and hammer them.

Fish oil capsules inserted in them, sardine, anchovy oil put on the plug and inserted, or pam cooking spray with garlic sprayed on them.  Also saw the alka seltzer."
