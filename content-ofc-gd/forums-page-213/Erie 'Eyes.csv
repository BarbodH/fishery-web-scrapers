873023,captpierre,2014-09-18 01:39:00,2521,Great report!  Surprised at the speed  2.6 mph.  That's salmon speed.
873025,Old Ironmaker,2014-09-18 01:50:00,8243,"Way to smash em. This has been a prolific year for eyes here. Today our boat went 6 for 8 in a little over 3 hours. As the wind switched from NW to SW the suspended fish hugged bottom. No riggers out today but our buddies were banging the bottom (75') with cannon balls and got them there. We were about 10 miles SE of the stacks which I thing I see in 1 pic. All the fish came of 10 colours with 250 feet of backer out. Black on Gold Ripplin Redfin and Blue on Chrome Reef Runner at around 45 to 50 feet in 75 feet of water. The harnesses on #1 Dipsys were only getting Silvers and stole all the worms so we pulled them and ran minnow baits faster at 2.5 to 3.0 MPH.  I like the plastic clevises on harnesses to reduce line wear and can change blades in a jiffy without changing the entire harness.  I marked a massive amount of fish up and down the water colume in 35' of water, Perch, smallies?? Calling for high winds tonight, tomorrow, those fish better wait for us.  Plenty of fish for everyone, come on down and come back soon Aaron."
