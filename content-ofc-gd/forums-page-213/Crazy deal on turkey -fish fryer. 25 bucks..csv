873663,GBW,2014-09-23 02:36:00,8460,"The Port Perry store was rude about it when I pulled out the print out on Sunday.  So I didn't get one, lol.  I don't need one but sure as hell can make use of one rather than the $30 some odd $$ GC I have for that damn store.  Oh well.  When I find a fishing item marked wrong I will then use the card but till then I'll keep my funds with me."
873965,nancur373,2014-09-25 01:35:00,1211,Scored another in Brampton today
873384,porkpie,2014-09-21 00:39:00,2521,"Assistant manager at Guelph Walmart wouldn't do it even thought the model numbers where identical.  He have some Bull excuse that the UPC was different.  He was blowing complete smoke and he knew it, but wouldn't bend nonetheless. Fortunately I was going that way anyhow, or I would've been really pissed!"
873386,lickmyarmpit,2014-09-21 01:04:00,359,"Just got mine at the store in Milton, there's one left. Yup just a quick call to the manager and score thanks for the heads up brother."
873387,Pikeslayer,2014-09-21 01:07:00,1443,"Yep, still got 2 reserved for OFC members. If nobody claims by end of day tomorrow (Sunday), they'll go to Fishing for Tyler & Fishing for a Cure."
873400,Nipfisher,2014-09-21 02:28:00,2449,I got the 1 and only at the North Bay location today. Brought in the print out and had the assistant manager authorize it. No problem. Thanks Andrew.
873407,Rod Caster,2014-09-21 12:21:00,5784,You beat me to it Blair!
873410,skinny,2014-09-21 12:28:00,442,i got one in st thomas but was big deal right to the upc code thing they had 2 I got one and they are pulling other off shelf  i really think they really freak out when they see 100 off
873413,Gerritt,2014-09-21 13:00:00,6129,Weird... I had no troubles at the two locations close to me.. I would have asked for the district managers phone number. I bet that would have gotten results quickly.  G
873416,Freshtrax,2014-09-21 13:35:00,2215,The In laws cleaned out the Smiths Falls location yesterday.
873423,mcdougy,2014-09-21 15:45:00,274,I tried two locations in london and both managers shut it down. Said the UPC didn't match. A little ticked
873425,misfish,2014-09-21 15:58:00,29133,"Cabelas has oil, but it,s canola. $50. Think I,ll be shopping around. I told the fella the great deal we all got. He asked if they had any left? LOL"
873427,tb4me,2014-09-21 16:51:00,3295,Dont use Canola oil..Nasty ass GMO crap.....
873436,supercharged115,2014-09-21 18:44:00,8,Tried the same thing at two Hamilton locations and they both said no as the UPC numbers didn't match...oh well.
873438,Steve,2014-09-21 18:47:00,2075,FYI.  A close friend of mine works in the sports department in a local walmart (here in Hamilton).  They received a special email this morning advising the stores NOT to match this product as it was not the intention of Walmart to do so.  They even provided a customer service number for customers to call if they wish to make a complaint.  I'm thinking the power of this web board made walmart doing some back peddling.
873439,misfish,2014-09-21 18:53:00,29133,"We finally got to screw someone,instead of getting screwed.LOL"
873442,Terry,2014-09-21 19:44:00,14456,lol

873573,nancur373,2014-09-22 17:15:00,1211,"Get em while you can boys. Markham 9th line Walmart had five in stock but would only make an exception for one unit as the bar code numbers did not match. I called Walmart customer service to ask if the would honor it but she said that the stores don't match online 'clearance' items ever. So I said to the manager of the store, ""You're right, I'll just take the one"""
873600,fishermccann,2014-09-22 21:23:00,655,"Got one. Today at 5pm. The staff had obviously dealt with it earlier as they said , Not again, just give it to her, ( the wife went)."
873603,Canuck2fan,2014-09-22 21:43:00,1444,"None left in Stratford, or at least the 2 reps I asked didn't know about them. One said they might be in a week or so for Thanksgiving, and asked, did I look in housewares?... I just nodded OK and said I will check back. LOL"

873616,sofabed,2014-09-22 22:33:00,119, I picked one up In Cambridge around 4 pm today. The clerk they don't match sales prices online as well. I asked her to check with the manager and he gave it to me the $25. They had one more on the shelf. Thanks for letting us know about the deal.
873641,fishermccann,2014-09-23 01:12:00,655,They are in the BBQ section.
873647,pikeyminnow,2014-09-23 01:26:00,18,"Store in peterborough's north end had 3 on the shelf today. Talked to the duty manager and she said no at first, but finally agreed to make a onetime exception. She told me to bring it through customer service to ring it in at discounted price. When I got it up there, they found the UPC code didn't match so changed their mind and wouldn't give it to me for that price. Needless to say , I wasn't too happy but nothing I could do about it."
873648,nancur373,2014-09-23 01:52:00,1211,My cousin just got the last two in a Brampton Walmart

873190,Freshtrax,2014-09-19 18:06:00,2215,I'm not a Walmart fan so I have no shame in pulling thir pants down .  I walked into the store with this on my ipad and they price matched it..  http://www.walmart.ca/en/ip/complete-fry-and-boil-combo-with-side-table/6000132108927  Saved a hundred bucks.
