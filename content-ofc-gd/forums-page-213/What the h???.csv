He finished fishing a spot, turned the key to start the motor, clunk! Gone! He was standing up still and hadn't touched the throttle/shifter. That's a new one for me."

874288,grimsbylander,2014-09-27 20:54:00,3016,He and the kids managed to get towed off Georgian Bay. It's lousy when something goes wrong and the kids are on the boat. It appears the shaft just sheared off.
874289,Cast-Away,2014-09-27 21:06:00,790,"Never heard of that before. Good thing they were safe. Has he recently hit something?  Fishermen,  I don't think it was a funny thing where is the humour in what happened?"

Fishermen, I don't think it was a funny thing where is the humour in what happened? Okay, okay, bad moment, it's just one of those things that I laugh at, like willy coyote and the roadrunner.  What else could go wrong with a merc.  Old friend of mine had the upper motor release from the whole lower shaft and assembly,  fortunately he only had to float down the river to get back home.  Glad the kids are okay and he got a tow.   Almost can't see why the shaft would or could shear off, makes no sense.   Even if the rear bearing assembly came off, there's 2 bevel gears on the shaft that would prevent any forward/backward movement."
874323,creditmaster,2014-09-28 02:08:00,190,damn ............never herd of that happneng
874326,grimsbylander,2014-09-28 02:32:00,3016,"I'll post a picture. The end of the shaft looks like it had some corrosion/rust on it where it broke. It must have had a hair line crack for a long time. Luckily, it broke off and sank when he fired up the motor, not while at wot. Strange one for sure."
