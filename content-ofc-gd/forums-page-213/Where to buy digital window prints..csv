There are quite a few in Barrie..  Thanks John. I was not sure. I know a place to try then. Can you see through them from inside ?  So if I have a picture,they should be able to make it?"

874353,John,2014-09-28 12:43:00,2956,They can print pretty much anything Brian. Yes you can see through them but its like having a very dark tint it does reduce visability somewhat. Why not just get the whole vehicle wrapped....about $4500 would cover it....lol
