874276,Tomcat,2014-09-27 18:30:00,395,Thanks for sharing. Just wondering though what your reason was for changing up your rod and reel?
874283,Headhunter,2014-09-27 19:16:00,5703,I'd rather watch your videos than a fishing show any day! Thanks Simon!  HH   PS... still envy your dog! LOL

Just wondering though what your reason was for changing up your rod and reel? I love slip bobbering but you don't get the thrill of feeling the hit, so for the last bit i switched up to my other rod that is set up ready with a jig.  I'd rather watch your videos than a fishing show any day! Thanks Simon!  HH   PS... still envy your dog! LOL  Thanks HH….the pup is getting better with age…he was a royal pain in the butt for the first 2 years."
