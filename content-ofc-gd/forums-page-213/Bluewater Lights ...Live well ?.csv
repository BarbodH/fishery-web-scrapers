873635,2 tone z71,2014-09-23 00:34:00,1311,agreed !!  http://www.bluewaterled.com/lwinstall.php
873639,Fishinbum,2014-09-23 00:54:00,9,"White strip leds for car interiors work for lighting up live  wells. No need to drill. cut to size, dab of silicone on each end. just stick them on and run the wires out a hole in the top of the livewell. tbe are water proof already. 3leds ( aprox 3"" strip ) is all u need"
