Anyway, I have not been able to log on to OFC lately from either of my laptops at home but at work it is fine with the same computers.  Using my home network I get an error saying ""Sorry, you don't have permission to go there"".   All other websites are fine and I have tried both IE and Google Chrome.  I just tried logging on using my other ISP and everything is fine.  Any ideas why this could be happening?  Thanks in advance."
