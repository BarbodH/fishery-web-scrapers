183451,Rustic-Fisher,2008-04-07 22:35:00,826,"First I better excuse myself,  I think I may have blown right by ya C.C an Bly at a certain Muddy trib before I hastily went back to my truck and off to find fishable water. I should have introduced myself LOL....Just realized when I saw your post. Anyways, Finally found some water worth drifting (lots of fuel later)  and caught a mixed bag of fish, Could not get them to touch anything but roe. Lost more than were landed due to the heavy lumber factor in the creek but the lumber is where the Brown was hidden! Heres a few shots of a couple of fish from today.        RF"

183595,bpsbassman,2008-04-08 01:09:00,941,"Looks like a great day on the water Ryan.  Nice post. Just ignore eyeforelle, she's just jealous!"

183635,smbhunter,2008-04-08 02:09:00,186, LOL!!! 'She's just jealous.'  Nice job Ryan. Beauty brown.
183638,Rustic-Fisher,2008-04-08 02:12:00,826,"LOL,   Roger thats one of our BPS co-workers horsing around, he has hair like girl though!! RY"
183644,Rustic-Fisher,2008-04-08 02:18:00,826,"Pack is OK, it does get in the way a little although I 'll take it any day over my vest. Most days if I can get away with it I 'll just use a waist pack, lighter the better but it all depends on the region your fishing I guess.  RF"
183665,bpsbassman,2008-04-08 02:42:00,941, I know Ryan.  He/she's one of our finest!!

I wonder how many pm’s I’m going to get now about people asking me to get special discounts for them? Please kill me.   Damn straight. You know you love me Roger. Which reminds me, I really need to take that pic down from the wall, its getting pretty embarrassing. As for the hair, it will live forever, or at least till someone sneaks into my room at night and cuts it. Till then Cactus Jack says Bang Bang!!  P.S. JENOOOOOOOOO"
