Seems pretty solid at most of the areas around the docks, for myself i think it would be alright for the area im planning to fish  , but at the same time would like some guidance from anybody whos been around there. I do not think anybody fishes the area..atleast not right now. Im only looking at trying to catch some perch or crappie just for some fun. Please give your feed back as to whether or not i should even bother due to the way the weather has been for the last couple days.Thanks Guys Jason"

By gone I mean 50 cm - 1m from shore, the rest was ice.  So getting on might be difficult.  The docks looked solid though.  Not sure of anything south of the docks as I turned on tiffin to get to work.  Either way be careful."
