We are supposed to pickup our new to us boat this week, and I would like to know how I'm supposed to check the boat for liens against it. I know it's something we have to do, but still a little unsure..."

183236,workwear,2008-04-07 16:19:00,592,i beleieve you can register a lien on a pleasure craft...would only make sense if someone is financing it.....   and yes all leins usually do come up on a ppsa search....i think its 15dollars to get that check done
183302,rob v,2008-04-07 18:12:00,535,"To the best of my knowledge you can't register a vehicle (vessel) specific charge under the PPSA in Ontario like you can a car/truck/motorcyle etc.  But you can register a general lein against a person identifying the type of collateral pledged (boat).   What this means ism, unlike  a vehicle where you can do a search by vehicle serial number you need to search the person's name (proper name) vs the boat.    Hope that helps."
