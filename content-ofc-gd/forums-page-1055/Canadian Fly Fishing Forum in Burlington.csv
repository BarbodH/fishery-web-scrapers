Here's a link for anyone who didn't know about it. http://www.iwffc.ca/lib/2008_fly_fishing_forum.pdf . It's $12 admission at the door and $15 for each seminar. That could add up quick, but if you pick one or two it's not too bad I guess. Free with admission would be better,but maybe it's not big enough yet? Any feedback would be appreciated."
183668,kennyman,2008-04-08 02:47:00,737,WOW!! Nobody replying or looking at this???  I can't believe nobody here is going. Is it that bad?
183671,irishfield,2008-04-08 02:50:00,26272,Come this time of year Kenny... I think everyone is polishing tackle or washing it in their local stream/lake/river. Heck I might have to go fishing with Terry in my old port-a-bote this weekend.. terrible stuff.
183690,huntervasili,2008-04-08 03:26:00,1604,I will probably be there even though it's at the place of my work and I have to pay   Dont know which day yet though probably saturday as Sunday is shooting!!!
