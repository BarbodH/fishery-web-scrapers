181526,bramptonjerry,2008-04-04 14:23:00,132,"go up to the islands north of Pointe au Baril...have seen plenty, all sizes from 12"" to 4 ft"
181553,natemr2,2008-04-04 14:55:00,21,"I have been looking for years, maybe this year, on the topic of snakes two years ago on the maitland we had an explosion of the population of queen snakes, from what I have read they are quite rare in this river.  hope the pics worked  "
181688,Abraxus,2008-04-04 17:40:00,104,"I camp in the Moon River area often and I have never seen one of these snakes. I was planning on doing even more this summer.  I usually try to find camping spots on Crown Land as opposed to Park grounds.  I have a dog and I love taking her with me when I camp or fish.  When we set up a site, she usually strolls out along the fringes of the camp site area, marking her territory and what not.  I think this has been a great deterant for the bears and other critters as we have never had our campsite bothered by either when the dog is present.  I have always known that there were rattle snakes in that area, but from what I read, I was under the impression they are rare.  Now on the other hand, I am little concerned.  I would hate it if the dog got bit.  First thing first, I don't know if I would be able to diagnose it right away.  I mean dogs often get small injuries and what not from stepping on the wrong thing here and there, but if she got bit, that would really suck!  Has anyone had a dog that has suffered the bite of one of these critters?  Is it deadly and how fast does it take for the venom to do serious harm?  Ab"
181699,Puckhead,2008-04-04 17:48:00,377,"One time I was hitting out of the rough on a course (I'm a crappy golfer so out of the rough is pretty standard).  As I was pulling up on my back swing, I hear a rattle and look down and this thing lunges out at me...  I jump back and sure enough, it's a big rattler...  I took a drop."
181736,kemper,2008-04-04 18:32:00,2232,Ran into one while walking rocky shore once...was planning on fishing there but apparently he liked the rock pile.  I didnt argue.
181760,GbayGiant,2008-04-04 19:19:00,1780," So I just showed my Mom these pics, she told me when she was young she had a medium sized dog take one in the neck by a average sized rattler when she was with her mom, the snake started rattling and the dog was protective like all dogs, so he tried to eat it and got bit good. Her dad said not to take it to the vet (my grandpa he's old school, lol) so apparently it swelled and pussed out within minutes for a full day and gradually just healed itself over the next day. Now I would recommed taking your pet to the vet, but I guess they can survive and as far as people it's apparently super painfull but not fatal unless your stuck in the bush by yourself and can't handle the pain to go get help, and a young kid or infant make sure you get to hospital asap.  Generally the bigger the snake the more venom, the less you weigh the more it will affect you, I'm 240lbs but not willing to do a field test."
181784,philly86,2008-04-04 19:56:00,10,"I see them all the time while camping up at bruce penisula. About two years ago when we were hiking on a trail that hadn't been hiked all day about two hours from camp and we had the dog with us. Anyway he was infront with his snout to the ground and ran right into one and got bit in the nose. We had to run him back on our shoulders and we ended up just giving him some allergy medicine and that took care of him. His face swelled right up though, he looked pretty funny. Lots of snakes up there  Mike"
181804,Big Cliff,2008-04-04 20:24:00,6899,"While I don't totally agree with everything they have said here (I have had one chase me), some of it has to be true!    Ok time for some facts (Sort of)  All I can say about being bitten is; every report I have ever heard of someone being bitten, they have survived and that keeping cool and calm and getting medical attention as quickly as you can is a good thing but panic is not a good thing.  I don't have any statistics regarding the number of people bitten every year/number of encounters/number of people that die but i would suppose that from what i have read it is extreamly low on all counts."
181806,irishfield,2008-04-04 20:32:00,26272,Parry Sound District and Midland Huronia Hospital stock anti-snake venom... so get your ass to either pronto if bitten!
183890,Riparian,2008-04-08 19:42:00,269,Thanks for the replys
183951,Abraxus,2008-04-08 21:38:00,104,"Yes indeed!  Thanks for the response with regards to dogs being bitten as well. It will certainly put my mind a little at ease this summer!  If you have ever had a dog die prematurely, you would know how much it sucks!  Ab"
181332,shane,2008-04-04 02:54:00,652,I saw one of these out while fishing on the Thames a few years back.  I later ID'd it as either a western or eastern hognose.    http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2411/238593..._2e23cf4903.jpg  click on the link for the second pic.
181337,Big Swede,2008-04-04 03:02:00,23," Yeah, that would be hilarious...  You know what would also be funny as hell? If a big fat dock spider ended up in your tackle box."
181346,GbayGiant,2008-04-04 03:15:00,1780,"Fireball, cool pic. I see those up here too we call them puffhaters (not sure) but it's cool how they puff their heads out like a Cobra.    Daren, I'm surprised you haven't seen one up here before, your best bet is to look on the little back roads on a hot July/August day just before dark they come out and shed their skin on the hot roads, or take a walk in any bush around here and dig around enough around rock piles or brush and you'll get a surprise, there all over the islands too.   No joke, they are huge. I've come across a few of those as well, I remember this crazy carpenter I was working with one day grabbed a 5 footer by the tail, twirled it around like a helicopter and tossed it in the water off the dock."
181402,Carp,2008-04-04 07:26:00,1488,"I camped on Beusoliel Island near Honey Harbour last summer with the kids. We didn't run into any rattlers ourselves, but park wardens caught and moved 3 of them spotted by other campers. We saw them on their way to the warden's boat. Seems like this snake isn't so rare anymore.  About 15 years ago, a few guys, including myself, were camped on a small island in a very remote area of Georgian Bay, just north of the Key River. Lots of channels around the many islands. We were running out of daylight and had to find a spot quickly to set up the tents.  Although we didn't spot any snakes that night, the place was littered with them. Most were around the 2 foot mark in length. I don't remember hearing any rattles, but the snakes were very agressive.  We cleaned a few small pike for lunch and the snakes were waiting for the scraps. Tossed skins, guts, etc. in the water near shore and the snakes were diving after them. Picked up the scraps and swam away. The next day, they must have sent out a singnal because there were about a dozen swimming around our boats and cuising the shoreline. We were paddling through a narrow, shallow channel between islands and a huge snake swim right under the boat. I could see it's head on one side of the boat and the tail on the other. Had to be 6 or 7 feet long and thick. This thing looked like it could swallow a racoon.  I'd rather take my chances with the bear that was sniffing around our campsite. The big bruin swam across the channel towards us just after lunch. We all stretched out for a snooze. Good thing my dad heard him, or he would have walked right up to the guys napping in the sunshine after lunch. As soon as we turned in for the night, that bad boy came back. One of the guys heard a noise and looked out the tent window. Freaking bear was right outside the window messing up out camp.  The bear didn't bother me. Snakes and other reptiles, especially poisonous or ones that want to take a bite of your flesh, .....well. Let's just say there weren't any return trips planned."
181418,Rich Clemens,2008-04-04 11:05:00,3131,We have diamond backs around here and I'm happy to say that I've never seen one in the wild.  Been to the French and G-bay and never ran across a rattler.    That's just one more example of two things that do not go well together ..... me and snakes.    Instant pants fillers those things are.
181428,wallyboss,2008-04-04 11:34:00,1095,"I have warned most of my fishing buddies!!! That if they play a trick on me by putting a snake in my tackle box or lunch box, that we will no longer be friends, but that I will visit them in hospital once just to tell them  ""I told You so""  Hopefully they will be out of there coma so I am sure they understood me.!!!!  I usually tell them the story about my co-worker that put a frog in my lunch box, on the first day of that job after seeing that all the guys were jokers, I warned them that I have no problem taking a joke but that my Lunch was off limit. That job was a very physical one and I needed my lunch for fuel.  One day at lunch I open my box and there is a frog in my lunchbox.I am french and for some reason that's the nickname they gave me(very original) So I look around and the guy across the table from me has a big grin on his face . So I reached over grabbed him by the collar and just walloped him one . Both of his eyes were black by the time he hit the floor. All the big bosses were sitting at that table with us, but my immediate boss got up and said that everybody were warned on my first day not to F&%K with my lunch and he showed them the frog in my box and said ""Seems like this guy didn't listen."

181516,16 Footer,2008-04-04 14:08:00,191,I have camped at Massassauga PP for 10 years and never seen one other than a few water snakes a bears.
180822,Big Cliff,2008-04-03 09:43:00,6899,"Years ago when I lived in French River we saw many of them, I was out picking worms one night and had one actually come at me, I kept backing away from it but inspite of what MNR will tell you, it was quite agressive.  Back in the late 60's MNR denied there were any in the area. My Mother-in-law attended a community meeting and one of the topics was the snakes being seen in the area. I don't know the name of the MNR rep that was chairing the meeting but when the topic was mentioned he insisted there were none in the area. Without a word, my Mother-in-law walked up to the front with a sac in her hand and plunked it down on the table right in front of them, yup, inside the bag were two good size ones, alive and well. As they just about fell over each other trying to get away from the table they finally had to agree that there MIGHT be the odd one in the area LOL.  She laughed about the look on that MNR reps face for years after that.  In loving memory of Sibble  (Mary) Mines; gosh I miss that woman!"
180829,pikehunter,2008-04-03 11:10:00,1659, Would have made a hell of a surprise for someone if you had put it in the bait bucket!
180831,lunkerbasshunter,2008-04-03 11:15:00,2585, That was great!!!!!!!!!!  i love yoru mother in law!  Cheers!
180833,Out4Trout,2008-04-03 11:19:00,98,"We saw one at Moon River while fishing. Interesting, the rattle was more like an insect buzz. This was not a fox snake, but a Massassauga - as the rattle was quite visible. Glad we don't have Timber rattlers here, they are in Pennsylvania in the mountains - saw one there at a friend's hunting camp in the woodpile. Much larger and scarier than our little Massassaugas."
180835,lunkerbasshunter,2008-04-03 11:21:00,2585,"about 15 years ago a friend of mine father ran over one with a lawnmower, a small one about 10 inches at the most.  it was diffenatey a M rattler from what the mnr told him.  Get this........It was in oakville close to the 16 mile creek area.  I used to fish this area all the time when i was a kid.  after that you sure watched your step walking down that area lol.  I have never seen or heard of one that far east or that close to the gta before.  I have heard they are in the elora area now as well.  Cheers!"
180847,BITEME,2008-04-03 12:15:00,1969,Got and cornered a small one about 5 years ago on a Cub trip at Royal Botanical Gardens it was bagged and tagged and released north  Made for an interesting project for a couple of weeks
180949,addy79,2008-04-03 16:10:00,573,Massassauga PP is full of em...last time i portaged to clear lake we stayed on an island on the south end and saw one sunning itself on the rocks. beautiful snake.
180956,wallyboss,2008-04-03 16:32:00,1095,If you ever see me screaming and running !!!  Just go towards where I just came from and you might be able to see one!!! Or it might just be a small garter snake but they are all the same to me. I see some on TV and I change the channel.
180958,ch312,2008-04-03 16:34:00,1590, want me to post a video of my ball python eating a live rat?
