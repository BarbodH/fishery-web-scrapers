183990,irishfield,2008-04-08 22:50:00,26272,Don't have the link handy but Temagami still has about 30 inches.. but shoreline is starting to go and can't get cars on anymore.. We're all figuring last week of April.. first weekend of May before the ice will be off.

I'm algonquin bound as usual for the opener, but the ice out forecast has me nervous. There will be open water by April 30th no doubt...but the next 2 weeks will be the factor in deciding if my entire route is passible. Unless the weather turns Drasticly I think we'll get there just fine(knock on wood) but I'd rather not be dodging Ice burgs in a kevlar canoe"
