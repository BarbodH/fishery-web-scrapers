183876,Headhunter,2008-04-08 18:39:00,5703,"The Blonde Handywoman  A blonde, wanting to earn some extra money decided to hire herself out as a 'Handywoman' and started canvassing the neighborhoods.  She went to the front door of the first house and asked the owner if he had any odd jobs for her to do.  'Well, I guess I could use somebody to paint my porch,' he said. 'How much will you charge me?'  The blonde quickly responded, 'How about $50?' The man agreed and told her that the paint and everything she would need was in the garage.  The man's wife, hearing the conversation, said to her husband, 'Does she realize that our porch goes all the way around the house?'  He responded, 'That's a bit cynical, isn't it?'  The wife replied, 'You're right. I guess I'm starting to believe all those dumb blonde jokes .'  A short time later, the blonde handywoman came to the door to collect her money. 'You finished already?' the husband asked.  'Yes,' the blonde replied, 'and I had paint leftover, so I gave it two coats - no extra charge.'  Impressed, the man reached into his pocket for the $50 and handed it to her.   'And by the way,' the blonde added ... 'it's not a Porch -- it's a Lexus' HH"
