Ice conditions were some of the best of the season when the season officially closed on Simcoe and other parts of the province on March 15th but the action remained strong for open species right through.   I was out on Simcoe the last day of the season and like a number of folk experienced some awesome action. In fact we hit so many Whitefish we had a number of double headers and a triple header and limits came quick. Here is one pic of some of the fish taken on the 15th......   Also, the ice remained excellent for perch action right until the 1st week of April. Although I found the fish really scattered we were still able to have some great days catching a number of fish in the 10-13"" range.... attached is a pic of a typical late season Jumbo... the interesting thing of this year is that these fish came deep (35-50') rather then the 20-30 ft I would normally fish at last ice.    My last ice fishing trip this year was on Sat where I had a couple of guests out on a Haliburton lake. In approx. 4 hrs we iced 4 really nice lakers and had 5th one break us off that was just screaming the drag off until the line broke. Was a real treat to be on the ice in April and will cetainly make the spring season short before getting the bassboat back out on the water.   I trust all of you enjoyed this past winter and had a safe fun time out on the ice.   PS I attached one last shot of a early March trip on Simcoe.... the pic was taken with a special effects and looked really cool so though I would share....although the fishing was slow that day we did eventually get our limit of whitefish and one nice 5.5lb laker before heading in.   Best of luck to all this coming summer.... Greg."
