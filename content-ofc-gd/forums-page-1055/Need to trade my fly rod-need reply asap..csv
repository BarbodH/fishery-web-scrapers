183386,BITEME,2008-04-07 21:36:00,1969,depends what you want I guess
183388,kennyman,2008-04-07 21:38:00,737,"I say if they're what you want, then trade. That's a nice reel. Do you want heavy action rods? If you do and you're not using your fly rod then both of you should be happy. What do you want to fish for?"

183396,idesign,2008-04-07 21:43:00,149, i really dont know about bait casting reel/rod.i use spinning rod/reel only.that is why i need help to see if i am getting good stuff in trade for my fly rod.
183436,idesign,2008-04-07 22:20:00,149,Can i get some more suggestion please.
183439,kennyman,2008-04-07 22:25:00,737,"If you want monster pike then a 7' heavy rod and a Abu would be good for you ........ so something you don't want for something you do seems like a good plan, right ??"

183796,idesign,2008-04-08 14:23:00,149,any last minute suggestion.
183823,irishfield,2008-04-08 16:29:00,26272,Take some responsibility for your life and go out on a limb... trade him already if he hasn't backed out by now.
