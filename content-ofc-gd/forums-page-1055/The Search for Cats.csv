183666,Rich,2008-04-08 02:44:00,3927,"This is part 1 of the spring cat series, titled ""the search"". Today was technically my second scouting trip of the season but really the first good try as the first time I was only out for an hour or so. We headed to our first spot to find it just full of carp. Lots of carp landed on both corn and sucker meat (that's a first), yet the channels eluded us. Finally, Sugarpacket and I both had encounters with kitties, but they were quick to shake the hook. We moved further downstream and found nothing but bullheads. One missed channel cat here by Sugarpacket and that was all. Bullheads pass the time though and we both had a great time in awesome April weather. And those cat encounters let us know they are there for next time.   First piggy carp of 2008   Hard to beat a view like that   Mr. Bullhead and the Bullhead Queen   Beauty sunset to end the day  Good times. Though we didn't land any channel cats, neither of us can complain about a day like that."
