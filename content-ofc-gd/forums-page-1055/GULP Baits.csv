Used to use live leeches almost exclusively, but have switched to soft plastic drop shotting and use anything from power leeches to the gulp goby. The goby is a bigger bait therefore most times will hook the bigger slobs.....one downfall that is mentioned, is that it is not a soft plastic and will become easier to degrade and rip off the hook as you use it"
181012,tbayboy,2008-04-03 19:16:00,1497,One BIG thing to remember with gulp (including gulp alive) is that its not well... alive.  If you drop a minnow and a gulp which ones going to move without any help from you?  Thats a big thing to remember - you have to impart the action that a live bait would impart on its own (of course sometimes live bait needs help too).
181016,wallyboss,2008-04-03 19:34:00,1095,"I've done the live bait test also, 1) live worms or  Gulp nightcrawlers for catfish.  3 to 1  in favour of Gulp  with over 50 catfish caught that night .  2) worm harnesses  Gulp night crawlers  and  Live minnows and Live worms.        2 guys on live bait and I was using Gulp and I outfished them 5 to 1."
183755,Rattletrap2,2008-04-08 11:58:00,1652,"I never had any use for the original Gulp product. I do like the look of the 3"" leeches in the pails, so I will be giving them another shot this year."
183774,mepps,2008-04-08 13:12:00,1301,"GULP sinking minnows are my all time favorite for largemouth bass.  You can use them sub surface with lots of action, or allow them to slowly sink and trigger hits from inactive bass.  These are the type of hooks I liek to use:   Even caugt a couple of musky with these."
183790,mattyk,2008-04-08 13:52:00,2110,"i love the glup minnow grubs, ""3 in white and chartreuse, on a black or pink 1/4 ounce jig head. They are amazing and the walleye/sauger , white bass, love them down here on the Ohio river."
183809,OhioFisherman,2008-04-08 15:38:00,6623,"Tried the gobie drop shotting on Erie last year, non-Berkley tube out fished it, couldn`t even get a sheephead to take it. Don`t use live bait much and not at all recently, you can try the Gulp baits as trailers on a spinnerbait-buzzbait, instead of a pig on jigs.  They probably have some use."
180998,GbayGiant,2008-04-03 18:26:00,1780,"I got many bags of gulp, they are definitely the best artificial plastic out there, but out fishing live bait is a myth. Just for fun I've done some little tests and live bait has always out fished them but they do last longer and cheaper than buying minnows every day. The last one I did was ice fishing crappies and perch a couple weeks ago, I set up 3 hooks on a line 6"" apart, put a minnow on one hook and the other two had 2 different gulps, and I rotated their position throughout the day, didn't catch one fish one the gulp they took the live minnow every time."
