Managed to chase a few of these hard-fighting trout over the course of a couple beautiful weekends.....most of the fish were caught on a white jig, despite our best efforts and jigging techniques with a variety of spoons.  First Laker in a couple years for the Abb-meister and very first thru the ice!   First ever 'intended' lake trout for my good buddy Jeffery Blay.   Two trout, 5 minutes....and thats my limit for the day!   Our 5 fish limit came quick during our second weekend.   Brought my cousin Travis along the one weekend. He came all the way from Alberta!   Travis Claims he didn't have all that great a time on the ice....maybe its because him and my uncle are used to catching these guys on Great Slave Lake in the NWT!   Can't have a report without my patented 'thumbs up'!    All the trout we caught were no less than 2lbs and no greater than 4lbs. As for the Big guy from the NWT, it was not weighed, but looks at least 36inches....maybe more? From what I hear it fed the gang up there for a couple nights as my uncle is a helicopter pilot (and obviously an avid angler) out west. If you do target lakers on Loughborough please practice catch and release when you can and adhere to the 2 fish limit for your sport lisence and 1 fish limit with a conservation.  Can't wait to troll for these guys in the spring when the ice is out.  Enjoy,  Chris"

183797,Abberz,2008-04-08 14:24:00,140," TB I live in Kingston. Loughborough is a pretty solid lake, some big bass caught there in the summer. It does get quite a lot of pressure, but I think more and more people are practicing catch and release bass fishing these days."
