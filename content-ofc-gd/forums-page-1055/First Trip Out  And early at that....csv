Even tho they weren't finicky. They where hitting but I had to change up a few times to find out what size were thier mouths. I wasn't able to set the hook. First I had a hook that was too small then I changed up and the hook was too big. Tried a medium size hook.  Still kept missing them. Changed and took off the hair and went directly to a single medium size ""thin wire"" hook with no hair rig and then the fight was on.           Didn't stay out for long. I'm making plans to try out a new honey hole where the monsters lurk. Time to make-up ground bait and all the other goodies.  dsn"
