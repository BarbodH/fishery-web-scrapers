183232,dannyboy,2008-04-07 16:05:00,367,"We use TSP (tri sodium phosphate) to scrub the walls before painting; it will remove any oil residue like fingerprints and dirt. You can buy TSP in granular form in most hardware stores; just follow the directions for the proper dilution. Use a Scotch Brite pad to scrub and it will roughen up the surface at the same time, to allow the primer to adhere better.  Dan"
183313,Headhunter,2008-04-07 18:31:00,5703,"Just had our dining room painted last week. Our neighbour is a pro painter by trade and suggested a new line of Ben Moore paints that have just come out. Sorry, don't know the name, but this paint is remarkable in that it will not grow ""crumby"" with time, regardless of the colour you use. It is also very forgiving for those who's skill level are not up to pro level... speaking of leveling, it is self leveling. What really convinced us was the colour pallet available... like most manufacturers, they provide a number of colours, but what makes this stuff ""unique"" is that you can say, pick any three colours the paint is available in, and they will match each other! We tried playing this game at home, each on of us picking a colour, like from a deck of cards and every combination of three that were picked worked together. It also have a very tough finish when dry... which only takes less than an hour! HH"
183358,Big Cliff,2008-04-07 20:38:00,6899,"Well, I just finished painting our whole house (upstairs), I'll have the basement finished this weekend. First, use a GOOD quality paint We ended up going with colour Your World top of the line paint (it was on special for about 30% off). Good quality paints will cover better (but I still did two coats) and Sue is very pleased (which means I am too). When it comes to trimming, they have masking tape now that you can put on and get a clean release up to 14 days later, it's a little more money but worth every penny. Also, the GOOD quality paints don't spatter like the less expensive ones do, saves a lot of clean up and they are far more durable.  If you are finished painting for a bit but not finished the job yet, store your brushes or rollers in a plastic bag, squeeze out as much air as you can and seal it, I have kept rollers like this for two or three days and they were still good to use. Keeping them in the fridge does seem to be even better (still in the bag).  I'm not much good at trimming but I ended up using one of Sue's small craft brushes for those small touch ups and found that worked really well, also, keep a damp cloth available to wipe up any mistakes right away.  If you have any water stains to hide, pick up a can of BIN paint, CTC has it, just paint over the water stain and let it dry then paint it same as you would the rest of whatever you are doing, the stain will never bleed through.  Just a few of the things I learned the hard way. Wish you were closer and I'd come and help!  Hope it helps and good luck!"
183443,Tarzan's Jane,2008-04-07 22:28:00,1183,So much great info...I will be coming back to this thread again and again and again.  Big Cliff...you made me go aaaaahhhhhhh

So you end up paying low grade paint prices for the good stuff. There semi gloss is perfect for any interior jobs. Not too shiny and easy to scrub. Fairly thick so it goes on nice without being drippy. Best advise I can give you...always do 2 coats. Even if the can says one coat coverage and it looks good after one coat...do 2. Also as someone has already mentioned NEVER paint acrylic over latex. And I always do primer first. it may not be necessary, but I find starting over from a white primer base has always made the finished work look better. BINZ primer dries in 45 minutes and can go over acrylic or latex so that takes that problem out of the equation as well. I am not a painter but I enjoy painting and my finished work is always nice. Feel free to PM if you need anymore advice or have anymore questions."
182982,Tarzan's Jane,2008-04-07 01:14:00,1183,"Again..Thanks Everyone. But Holy Carp I have my work cut out for me....sanding, priming, then 2 coats...what great arms I'll have afterwards  hehehehe  Should I paint sideways or up and down....just kidding  Nancy"
182992,fishin'nut,2008-04-07 01:28:00,4,Everyone pretty much has it covered but one detail. If you are painting your walls a darker colour you should have your primer tinted a darker colour so you will only use 2 coats of paint vs 3 or more. Talk to your ICI paint experts they will fix you up. I just learned that tip and it saved me an extra coat of paint.
183006,Puckhead,2008-04-07 01:44:00,377,There are some pretty good washable flats on the market now.  A little more expensive but no sheen... Could be worth it if it's a really bright room.
183011,mikeh,2008-04-07 02:04:00,824,"a great tip I learned the hard way is if you are painting a burgandy(deep red) color , it is best to tint your primer a medium color grey then 2 coats of burgandy and it should give you a nice finish."
183073,ch312,2008-04-07 03:29:00,1590,"CIL makes a latex paint that has teflon in it. i used it on all my baseboards, crown molding, door jams, etc and it is easy to clean just like oil paint. my grandfather had been a professional painter since the days before rollers were even invented and he swears by oil for its durability and how easy it is to clean. but then my uncle who has been painting new homes for over 15 years swear by premium CIL latex paints. i think good latex paints are just as good as oil for durability and ease of cleaning.  another thing most people dont know about is recycled paint called boomerang which can be purchased at turkstra lumber. checkout their website to see how its manufactured. at $13.99 per gallon it sure caught my eye. i used it in my whole house (except the bathroom) and i am very happy with it. very easy to apply, covers very well, very durable, and super easy to clean. there arent many colors but it sure saves you quite a bit of money so its worth taking a look at.  oh ya...dont buy cheap rollers or brushes and just tape all edges for cutting in. remove the tape when the paint is WET to prevent peeling.  the ceiling paint that goes on pink and dries white is great for ceilings to make sure you dont miss any spots.  and add a contrast wall in your living room, bedroom, etc to make it look puuuuurdy"
183119,tinbanger,2008-04-07 11:03:00,1028,"another thing to be aware of is ( especially if you are living in the house while you paint) is VOC s ( Volotile Organic compunds) thats the stuff that gives some people headaches . All materials eminate these over time ( carpets ,furniture, cabinets ,paints etc) Even afte rthe paint is'dry'  Sherwin Williams Harmony series are low VOC and I'm sure there are many others as well.   Just something to think about.  TB"
