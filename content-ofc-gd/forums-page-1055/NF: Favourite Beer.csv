Ya the beer man dropping a case off at your house just like the milkman used to do.  And the construction workers taking a breather with a beer in heavy traffic.  The best part is, each town made its own beer and they were all good.  Never did make it to the Monastery where the Monks supposedly made the best beer in the world.  If Im not mistaken I think it was a castle in a town called Monster.  I miss Germany, a great place to live for 4 years.
