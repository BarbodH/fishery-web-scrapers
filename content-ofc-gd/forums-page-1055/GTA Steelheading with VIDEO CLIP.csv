183142,ranger520vx,2008-04-07 12:36:00,164,"Got out yesterday with my good buddy Casey for a real rod bending afternoon filled with very bright Steelhead.  Waters were up but clarity of about 8 inches had them pounding large pink bags until we actually ran outta bags and had to go home.  They wouldn't touch Chartreuse, Orange, etc...  Below is a couple minute clip that kills us to film the other guy because we all rather have a line in the water at all times.  Before the Internet, you didn't have to prove you had a good day to anyone...   "
183165,Charman,2008-04-07 13:32:00,5,I think there is no extended season at that creek?
183168,ranger520vx,2008-04-07 13:37:00,164,Year round to QEW.  And welcome to the Board btw....maybe you should introduce yourself or learn the benefits of a PM before you make a public remark like that for your first post?
183171,Charman,2008-04-07 13:46:00,5,Sorry Ranger.  I've been tempted to fish that creek for a long time but have always resisted because I thought there was no extended or year-round season.   Can you tell me what page of the regs shows extended season?  Thanks.  Sorry again... didn't know that I was the ignorant one (there's and oxymoron)
183173,lew,2008-04-07 13:50:00,12767,"Great video Ranger, thanks for taking the time to share it with us.  I see clips like that and it makes me think I should give that river fishing a try someday."
183181,ranger520vx,2008-04-07 14:07:00,164," Apology accepted. I have a lot at stake in fishing to firstly make such a mistake-then to publicize it with video. The regs are a Summary only. Look at page 92 and how FMZ Zone 20 boundary differs (red orange outline) in relation to, lets say. Highway2, QEW, CNR bridge."
183198,tbayboy,2008-04-07 14:43:00,1497,"Very cool, sure was a crazy current by the looks of it.  Congrats on a good day out there."
183202,Charman,2008-04-07 14:46:00,5,"You're right Ranger!  My apologies again.  On another note, MNR should consider hiring a cartographer.  Those maps need to be scalable in order to be used as boundaries.  Here is the a different section of the same map (it's all like this)...      ... I should be working instead of causing trouble."
183377,steelhedrmatt,2008-04-07 21:15:00,278,"I'm usually not one to jump in and criticize anyone for their handling of fish but I dont think its very good to hold them by their tail, FOR A FULL 11 SECONDS!!!  That fish probably has a broken back now.     Maybe next time, use a net.   LOL"
183401,idesign,2008-04-07 21:46:00,149,Can any1 tell me if we can catch steelhead in night.if yes what should i use as bait in night time.let me know.thx
183457,irishfield,2008-04-07 22:37:00,26272,Great stuff Ranger !!  Last month you couldn't net steelhead and had to tail them. This month it's the other way around. Thank god Muskie season starts soon.. ...
183575,Tarzan's Jane,2008-04-08 00:41:00,1183,"Note to self...turn volumne down, just about spilled my drink...that water is Loud! Nice video...and nice release too."
183577,ccmtcanada,2008-04-08 00:45:00,7971,Great video!
183582,danbouck,2008-04-08 00:53:00,4380, I guess the best thing to do is not fish for steelhead!
