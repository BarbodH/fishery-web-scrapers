183253,JohnAB,2008-04-07 16:56:00,178,"Well picked up my new fishing boat last week. Bought a Crestliner 1600 SC from the dealer in Edmonton. Price was good or at least I think so ($13500 plus GST) which included everything to go boating (4 life jackets, anchor, travel tarp, safety equipment, paddles etc). Boat came with a 50 HP Merc 2 stroke which I plan to upgrade next year to a 75 hp Optimax. Just didn't have enuff pennies this year to do it. Also came with a wireless Motorguide bow mount motor.  Anyways, here is a pic of it resting comfortably in the shop waiting for open water.  "
