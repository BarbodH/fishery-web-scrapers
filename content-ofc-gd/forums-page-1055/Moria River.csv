183382,MoriaRiverMan,2008-04-07 21:32:00,314,Hello everyone!  Iam located on the Moria River in Corbyville Ontario...  Just picked up a boat this year and plan on doing some fishing here.   Have been out a few times and picked up bass and pike on occasion.  Anyone got any tips for this location?

183427,MoriaRiverMan,2008-04-07 22:15:00,314,If the water keeps rising here ill be able to fish off the deck soon!!!!  only about 30 feet away right now.......
183556,bucktail,2008-04-08 00:24:00,1857,"try up stream near Foxboro , there is an old launch below the bridge on the highway. Go up to the Frink center or go downstream but watch for rocks. Slop bass and muskies on the edge,,.... fun fishing"

183628,Casey123,2008-04-08 01:55:00,461,"The first pics in our last report are of the Moria, the water is super high.  Is there any obstructions that would prevent steelies from getting up to the tribs that empty into the Moria?"
183708,Ramble,2008-04-08 04:04:00,713,"THERE SURE ARE!!  When they were giving out dams i think Belleville went back for a second helping. Personally the ""ice control"" dams on the river are a thorn in my side for MANY reasons. But i'm going to remain calm and not go off on a rant lolol  Bellow the 1st dam gets the odd salmon and the odd steelie....but they arn't very common. ANOTHER good place to rant but i'll pass again lol.  Unless you live in town it's not worth the trip. It's a sanctuary until the walleye opens anyway.   The upper moira above the dam's get one hell of a sucker run if you are interested lololol  Tight Lines  -R-"
