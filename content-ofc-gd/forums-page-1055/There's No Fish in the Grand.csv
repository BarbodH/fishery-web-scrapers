183655,Jen,2008-04-08 02:34:00,833,"Channel Cat Fishing April 7th /08 Well tonight after the store closed Bern and I decided to take a run out to the lake and have a look. As soon as we got around the bend out towards the Lake man did it get Burrrrrrrr…Once we arrived at the lake we found out why!  There was lots of ice floating around and still walls of ice piled on the beach.  Well after a quick peak at the lake it was time to run to the Channel Cats Spot. Low and behold they are in and seemed to be very hungry . It wasn't 5 minutes before Bern lands the 1st Cat - 15lbs, then 1 for me then another for Bern   ……little lay back then a double header …looks like its time to start the cat charter's...  It was a beauty night to be out on the water watching the Eagles Fly around with the Cats bouncing the Rods   And of course watching the Sun Set with the ladie I Love ..Thanks Bernadette for talking me into going fishing ..

183662,irishfield,2008-04-08 02:39:00,26272,Gee and I thought Bern and Jen had gone out fishing alone!  Some big cats there..
183670,silveradosheriff,2008-04-08 02:50:00,1025,Nice ones!
183673,Rich,2008-04-08 02:53:00,3927,"Figures. We didn't want to drive that far today, figuring it was still too early in the season. lol  Nice ones! And what a day to be enjoying the catfishing."
183675,Fishmaster,2008-04-08 02:53:00,920,Opps sorry guy looks like i posted in Jens name ...dam computers..lol
183680,Greencoachdog,2008-04-08 03:06:00,8163,Great report and pics!  I take it that those big cats are so plentiful in there because nobody eats them because the water is so polluted?
183695,Ramble,2008-04-08 03:44:00,713,awesome
183704,fatherof3,2008-04-08 03:59:00,1769,"looks like a good outing,congrats on the cats."
183706,Mike Pike,2008-04-08 04:02:00,1332,"Ok, so what I figured out so far is Bernadette and Jen are an item.  What I can't figure out is where Fishmaster comes in.  lol  Good fishin' y'all and some real beauty cats!  While everyone else is waiting for this season and that season to open, you guys are out slayin' em.  Thanks for the post."
183715,fishing,2008-04-08 04:20:00,167,"Good to know that fish are biting! According to ""The 2007 - 2008 Guide to Eating Ontario Sport Fish"" In that area, any channel catfish less than 22'' are good to eat (up to 4lb/month). And it's better not to eat any channel catfish longer than 26"". It's a lot of fun to catch big ones. They fight well. http://www.ene.gov.on.ca/envision/guide/"
183716,huntervasili,2008-04-08 04:24:00,1604,I'd read up on some other rivers too posted in there fishing... you'd be suprised how much sucker you can eat from GTA rivers mmm mmm mmm... But way to go there Fishmaster and Jen... nice haul.
183734,Tarzan's Jane,2008-04-08 08:05:00,1183,Some nice size cats...thanks for sharing.
183762,Jen,2008-04-08 12:44:00,833,"Nice post Steve, seems I am going to have to remember to log out when I use your pc... I had a great time fishing last night.  There is nothing like catching a cat fish while listening to the turkeys calling, and watching the eagles flying around ...   And for all those that were wondering... I do love myself as should everyone!  I just wouldn't do a post about it.  LOL  Cheers,  Jen  (Bernadette)"
