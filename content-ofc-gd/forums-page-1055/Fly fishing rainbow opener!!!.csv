Muddy"
183337,Hairpy,2008-04-07 19:29:00,73,"Muddy , I would recommend a bigger stick like a 6 or 7 weight. Egg patterns and black stoneflies and egg leaches all work good!  Joseph"
183339,MuddyWater,2008-04-07 19:33:00,218,well i figure if i can float fish rainbows with my 9ft fly rod converted into spinning rod i should be able to haul them
183345,Casey123,2008-04-07 19:59:00,461,"I don't fly fish yet, but I do tye my own flies (in antisipation of learning - later this spring I am going to place a post asking for a very patient voulenteer to teach Michelle and I the basics).  I use black gnat's under a float when the water is very clear with good sucess, also tried some egg sucking leeches with mixed reviews - great on the Boyne, not so much on the 20 Mile Creek."
183351,MuddyWater,2008-04-07 20:15:00,218,i do lots of fly fishing for browns and other fish i love dry flyin for browns its awsome!

Also check and see what hatches will be coming, likely BWO's will be the main one. Good luck to you!"
