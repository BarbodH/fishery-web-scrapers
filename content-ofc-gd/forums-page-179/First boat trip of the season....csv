In the past with my son I never told him we were going fishing before we left because it would have been incessant questions. This time I told him yesterday. I half expected to see him sitting in the boat in the driveway this morning when I woke up.  Hoped for some pan fish but they were few and far between. Lots of talk about his future fishing endeavours and wanting to become a zoo keeper when he grows up.      Not enough fishing after nearly 7 hours on the boat. One last cast:

912542,can u fish,2015-04-27 13:05:00,326,That is awesome if he can spend 7 hours on the water with a few fish being caught and not lose interest I would say he is hooked on fishing.
912562,fishnsled,2015-04-27 15:28:00,3520,"It's great to see all these reports with the kids getting out, awesome stuff!"
912576,kickingfrog,2015-04-27 16:36:00,8333,"He's been a champ. He's keen for pike and walleye this year. Hope to get some ""wopper"" pike as he calls them."
