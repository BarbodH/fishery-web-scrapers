912651,adempsey,2015-04-27 23:47:00,1498,I agree!  Hopefully it moves forward but that will depend on the $.  Might be a good way to deal with excess electricity too instead of selling it below cost.  http://www.youtube.com/embed/55Edq_Irstk
912652,John Bacon,2015-04-27 23:49:00,3277,"Interesting, but I notice that the first step is to separate water into hydrogen and oxygen.  This process requires electricity.  The next step is to convert CO2 into CO; this process requires heat.  A lot of energy will be used to produce the diesel.  I know they point out that is used green energy; but that is green energy that could be used for something else.  If we could just use the excess electricity to produce the ""blue diesel"" then it may make sense.  However, if we have to generate energy specifically to produce the diesel then if probably does not make much sense."
