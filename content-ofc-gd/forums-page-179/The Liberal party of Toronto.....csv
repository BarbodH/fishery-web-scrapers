912699,Old Ironmaker,2015-04-28 04:29:00,8243,"The gas plant fiasco was on everyone's mind, right off the heels of the Ornge debacle Ontario voted. I woke the next day to discover not only did Ms. Wynne and her friends were re-elected they were given a majority. Just like out here in Haldimand county whomever Caledonia votes for mayor is the mayor we all get. It's just about numbers, they have more citizens than the rest of the county put together. So how Toronto votes is which party is elected. Less ridings in big cities is the answer to our parliamentary systems flaws here in Ontario. I'm sure it's the same in other provinces.  I was reading a while back an article from a political pundit in the US. He was basically saying who says it is bad business to run a deficit in politics. Bill Clinton balanced the budget for the first time in a century, so what, the next POTUS put them right back into debt.  Everyone wants services increased without tax increases and user fee increases, how would that work exactly?  Marvin Ryder from Macs business school says selling off provincially owned businesses isn't really a bad thing. Why should a government be in private sector businesses in the first place? Their mandate is to run the business of government, enacting laws, providing infrastructure and basic social services in order to enhance the quality of life of the citizens that they govern for. Not selling liquor and wine.  I did not vote Liberal because I knew Torontonians would and the Liberal candidate here was not the person I wanted in TO."

911879,lookinforwalleye,2015-04-23 13:27:00,4399,"Well we are as a province 287 billion dollars in debt....and the Liberal party of Toronto is running a 10.9 billion budget deficit, please stop the madness I have absolutely no confidence in this group of politicians to run anything....they have not created a real long term  manufacturing job worth talking about in years all that is done is increase taxes, increase the deficit and debt and now they want to sell Hydro not to eliminate the debt or deficit but to build transit which will increase the deficit and debt....I have no doubt that if you still smoke you will be paying more and if you like a beer after work that will cost you more and I also imagine that gas, and every license and fee will be increased as well.  For those of you out there that continue to vote Liberal Thanks!!!!     "

911889,Paudash,2015-04-23 14:10:00,273,the good news is they only have a majority for 3 more years  we only have ourselves to blame
911897,porkpie,2015-04-23 14:41:00,2521,I can't find a single person who admits to voting for the provincial liberals.  Wonder why?  My wife is a teacher and we still wouldn't vote for these sandbaggers.
911902,bigugli,2015-04-23 14:51:00,6138,"They are all corrupt, and not one party is going to act in the best interest of  most in this promise.  Each party will continue to cater to their faithful, and the special lobbies, and the porkbarrel continues in perpetuity.  As for the deficits and debt. Rae left a big debt for Harris. Harris, in turn, left one for the Liberals to build on, and Wynne will add to it for the next party that takes over, and that party will again do the same.  The same thing has happened in Ottawa since the 70's. Every political dynasty has left a mess behind for the new guys to clean up, and Harper will be no different."
911904,fishnsled,2015-04-23 14:57:00,3520,"I know of one person that voted for the Liberals in the last election, almost ended our friendship of 35 years. lol.   Met up with them yesterday and asked how they felt about the Liberals now?  No comment.   I hope the new budget comes with lots of lube as I believe we will need it.  I still bang my head over this party and how corrupt they are.  YET!!!  They still got voted in.  Not that there was much choice in the last election....  :wallbash:  Edit - you nailed it bigugli."
911910,Paudash,2015-04-23 15:18:00,273,it is sort of like when the NDP were elected in the 80's  They got the votes but everyone says they never voted for them

Maybe the liberals can govern T.O. and the rest of us can choose another party. However, bigugli is probably right about what we can expect from the other parties."

Harris, in turn, left one for the Liberals to build on, and Wynne will add to it for the next party that takes over, and that party will again do the same.   That is ture; however, the McGuinty/Wynne Liberals have accumulated more debt than all of the other parties combined.  And their contribution to the debt is still growing."

911928,Headhunter,2015-04-23 15:52:00,5703,"I won't be at all surprised when the government announces that they are going to be implementing M.U.D. as the NDP did, under Bob Rae. (Mandatory Un-paid Days) I also don't think the Liberals give one hoot about the teachers going out, as folks walking the picket line, don't get paid. The gov can save a lot of money, the longer these folks stay off the job. HH"

Until I have some real choices between candidates, I will continue to register my displeasure in the same manner."

912142,jimmer,2015-04-24 18:57:00,2730,I always love how they talk about reducing/balancing the deficit. How about the 200+ billion dollar debt. No level of Government should ever be able to get an unbalanced budget approved.
912261,moxie,2015-04-25 02:35:00,1566,"the good news is they only have a majority for 3 more years  we only have ourselves to blame Sorry but I will not be held responsible for something public""servants"" were complicit in. They chose to save their own cushy asses and hung the rest of us out to twist in the wind. Not too bright when you  think about it. When the axe  falls on their collective necks as it most certainly will, I know I won't be in my garage making signs to help them protest so they can take more from those of us that pay their freight. They acted like selfish and spoiled brats. I, like them, will watch out for my own from now on. With all due respect of course."

Tim Hudak gave it to them in a gold platter. over 30% of Ontario workers work for union, what was he thinking ? his own buddies asked him to step down from leadership."
912682,moxie,2015-04-28 02:13:00,1566,   Fair enough Stone but they did win it with lies. Public employees were lied too by their  own. At least Tim laid it all out. The truth is the public sector was gonna have to bleed regardless of who came to power and that isnt fair for those who deserve to serve . But at least they'll have only themselves to blame when the gut hook finds its mark. Too bad soo sad.
