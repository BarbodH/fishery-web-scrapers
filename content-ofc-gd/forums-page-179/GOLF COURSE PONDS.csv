912154,manitoubass2,2015-04-24 19:44:00,11391,Wow! Lol  We preach about fishing regs but now people wanna trespass to fish golf ponds???  Unreal
912182,Joeytier,2015-04-24 21:43:00,3990,How badly do people need to catch 2 pound bass?
912199,chris.brock,2015-04-24 23:01:00,4053,"As kids we did it in north Burlington. We would wear green clothes, keep quiet, stay in the bush and out of sight. Small to medium sized pike were mind blowing as a kid.  You worked on the ""Real Fishing Show""? That's pretty cool!"
912208,OhioFisherman,2015-04-24 23:38:00,6623,"http://www.forbes.com/2010/05/04/tpc-sawgrass-fishing-lifestyle-sport-golf-pga-tour.html  I recall hearing of a golf pro years ago catching a 10# plus bass out of a Florida golf course pond, it seems some of those golfers fish too. As far as I know all the golf course ponds in my area are stocked, getting permission to fish them? another story. It helps if you know someone in authority at them I guess?"
912214,bigugli,2015-04-25 00:09:00,6138,"The ponds are stocked for obvious reasons. Algae and grass eaters to keep the ponds from going scummy, and predators to keep those numbers in balance. A lot more cost effective than running large scale aeration, or dosing the ponds with algecides and defoliants."
912230,Freshtrax,2015-04-25 01:13:00,2215,"Talk to the head pro, or GM.   After last round out  doubt many of them would mind."
912237,fishing n autograph,2015-04-25 01:28:00,2540,Or ask for access in the early morning and promise to be off the course before first tee off time
912238,creditmaster,2015-04-25 01:28:00,190,"i live down the road from the lionhead golf course and the manager lets me fish it there are LMB,S AND SMBS also some trout"
912252,Old Ironmaker,2015-04-25 02:11:00,8243,"There are bigger fish than 2 pounds in the large ponds on my course. I have seen 20"" Smallies pulled out of there. The owners do let kids on the course in the spring and fall when they are not as busy. I wouldn't.  I wouldn't approve of  families walk the course with the dog either. It happens on our course and it can be dangerous because some don't have a clue what is going on. I have seen them stand too close to a fairway and wave you on. Move stupid. There is a huge liability issue at play here. Forget about drowning, the hazard is balls hitting some kid in the noggin when the pond magnets kick in and suck the ball towards the water hazard. Considering that course workers are required to wear hardhats I wouldn't want   to be the one explaining to the authorities that someone was seriously injured while fishing. Talk about lack of due diligence. I'm told I worry too much, I just don't want to be hauled into court."
912253,manitoubass2,2015-04-25 02:13:00,11391, Ever get hit with a drive? I have and it bleepin smarts big time

Small to medium sized pike were mind blowing as a kid.    In the mid 60's did much the same. Lived a short bike ride from some very private water and stocked ponds on the headwaters of Twelve Mile Creek here in Niagara. We had permission for some property but as always the grass was often greener over the fence, One pond well hidden in the bush had spec's up to 2 lbs., We were snobs even at a young age, we didn't fool around with the lowly stocked bow ponds."
912453,fishindevil,2015-04-26 21:54:00,6254,Yes it's true there is a few storm water management ponds in the east GTA that do have fish in them !!!! It's a fact ...... And lots of farmers field ponds have fish in them too !!!!!
912456,fishindevil,2015-04-26 22:10:00,6254,I was going to post a pic of the storm water pond but I can't it will give the spot away because of the background shot !!!! Lol ....and those 3/4 - 1.5lb largemouth will be gone .... I was suprised that they were there too .... Many years ago I my freind had permission to fish a golf course and there is a nice creek running through it and we fished it lots and would catch some nice little browns and the creek is so small you would not think that anything would be even there !! The pond was maybe a few hundred feet long and the same wide I guess .... It was maybe 10ft deep we used to swim there too   I'm not sure if any courses would let you fish them anymore probly due to the liability & garbage and destruction people do
912511,GBW,2015-04-27 03:25:00,8460,Most of the courses in Ont that the PGA stops at have all the bigger ponds stocked with bass. Been there and done that to know first hand to be honest.
912512,GBW,2015-04-27 03:28:00,8460,"As for the storm drains, yeah I know 2 in Brooklin some kids moved minnows into that were right after the rainbow run and where the minnows were taken from they were about to all die anyway due to lack of water. I want to go back to the one my kids friends plunked about 40 into... But I don't live there now..."

912026,bigugli,2015-04-24 00:27:00,6138,"Some courses stock the ponds. Others, it happens randomly through nature.  Very few golf courses will let you fish their ponds"
912034,John Bacon,2015-04-24 01:11:00,3277,I caught a bass and a bull head fishing a pond on Brookside.  A golf course that used to be in Scarborough.

912053,Old Ironmaker,2015-04-24 02:47:00,8243,"There fish in most larger ponds on courses. I was golfing a course in Carlisle years back that was owned by a former NFL 1st pickin the draft, Tony Mandarich ,and came across an older gent hauling in and releasing one Smallie after another. I stopped and asked him if it was possible to fish the ponds after pleasantries were exchanged, he replied, "" Yea sure, get your son to buy a Golf course and fish all you want."" My course is loaded with stocked Smallmouth. I'm told it isn't legal. The owner fishes when he wants. I've made a few casts and it's like shooting fish in a barrel."

912058,Freshtrax,2015-04-24 03:24:00,2215,Biggest bass of my life came from a farmers irrigation pond in NC.   Legit 10 lb largemouth I could have almost spit across that pond.

912090,Beavertail,2015-04-24 13:00:00,331,"Years ago, before I had my drivers licence, my buddy and I would jump on our mountain bikes and hit one of the local golf courses...they never had an issue with us on their property. We tried to stay out of sight nonetheless and off the greens/fairways. We'd sneak along the creek that connected 2 fair sized ponds, catching pike along the way. It was loaded with fish back then, and one of the few places we knew of that guaranteed fish. Hard to believe but we caught pike up to 32"" in that little creek. We even used to ice fish the ponds in winter!! Haven't been back in a long time, I'm sure things have changed but good memories anyway."
912097,manitoubass2,2015-04-24 14:06:00,11391,"One course I golf has a natural creek coming in from rainy river. Just to the north of the course, maybe 200 yards is absolutely loaded with crappie.  Never wondered about the water on the course however, im too busy golfing??"
912104,Beavertail,2015-04-24 14:45:00,331,"One day while fishing that particular golf course I witnessed something that makes me laugh to this day. It involved a golfer who's ball landed inches from the water's edge on the pond where we were fishing, and on a very steep bank. To his credit he gave it his all, duffed it, lost his balance and ended up in the pond flat on his back...I'm sure he had a few wobbly pops in him. Took him a good 5 minutes to drag his butt out of the pond and up that steep bank. We were pretty young and too afraid to laugh out loud, but you should have heard his buddies killing themselves, it was priceless."
912117,netminder,2015-04-24 15:53:00,514,Golf course I used to work at had goldfish in the ponds... not sure if that counts lol
