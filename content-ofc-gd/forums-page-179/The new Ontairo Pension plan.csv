Those people will always have my sympathy and deserve compassion and or assistance.  But I truly believe this is the .1 % of the population.  Percentage wise I believe the rest of us have the ability and the opportunities to make for a comfortable retirement. Perhaps we disagree on the %. My point has always been that MOST people who complain have squandered there chance to take ownership of there finances and there future and try to lay blame on others and the government in particular is always an easy target. The government has always and will always be inept with our money. That will never EVER change. I honestly can't believe people think it ever will. I have just excepted it for what it is and moved on. Fixating on something you can't fix or change is not good for anyone.  Cliff my company got rid of our pension 4 years ago. My grandfathered pension will not be enough to keep us in groceries. We have went through the cancer dance in our house.

I have no issues with a safety net that I pay into to help those that have been hit by financial issues it could be me even with all of the hard work and struggling I did to save while my friends had the shiny new cars...etc. I however am against the amount of money that is spent on those that have found a way to bilk the system with false claims or miss use of the process. I don't have the answer on how to fix it because more regulation spends more of the money. I have yet to see a government program produce better financial rewards better than a smart investment portfolio, The theory that a government can get 1.00 from each person and use that money to help a few is a waste of money that the masses could use to fund their futures. It would take a massive educational program and people willing to help themselves but in our society it seems to still be an impossible dream. Many wonder what the difference is between a man doing well and a poor person if both are given the same resources and tragedies in life. Big Cliff is a good example as some has asked how does he survive it is because he saved when he could and right now is making the hard choices to survive. With that attitude if he had not the trials that are before him he would be having a retirement that we all envy and want. The use of government resources to help him and people in his situation are what the system was designed for but it seems that the abuse of it prevents it from doing the job we empowered our governments to achieve.

He has also been told that if he contacts the drug manufacturer they might offer to provide the medication at a reduced price on compassionate grounds.

You shouldn't need a gov program to force you to save (and let  them manage your savings on \your behalf).  There are a lot of 'shoulds' in life! Realistically we know that only a minority will save on their own. Canadians have more per capita debt than ever before. Let's look at the consequences for the future if people don't voluntarily save enough for their retirement------a lot of seniors at the poverty level. So who is going to pay for the social services---welfare or whatever. Obviously the responsibility will fall on the general taxpayer. Isn't it better to prod people into saving their own money to spend later on rather than have to rely on other folks money??

I am now 69 years old and couldn't possibly live on the combined Old Age Security and CPP combined. Now I have worked since I was 16, always paid my taxes, never drew welfare, but I look at our politicians and see that they only have to serve two terms and they get a penson for life that is at least 4 to 5 times what I get a month (probably more).

Personally, I would prefer if we contributed more to the federal and just had 1 pension plan.  Anyone who hasn't contributed to the plan will not get the benefit of the plan, and rightly so.  I am having a hard time getting my head around someone who is currently retired who thinks they are entitled to benefit from a plan which A. Is not even in existence yet and B. They have not contributed to.  When this plan goes through if they somehow decided to pay people that are retired and have contributed nothing to the plan then my head would be spinning.

Personally, I would prefer if we contributed more to the federal and just had 1 pension plan.  Anyone who hasn't contributed to the plan will not get the benefit of the plan, and rightly so.  I am having a hard time getting my head around someone who is currently retired who thinks they are entitled to benefit from a plan which A. Is not even in existence yet and B. They have not contributed to.  When this plan goes through if they somehow decided to pay people that are retired and have contributed nothing to the plan then my head would be spinning.   They won`t though because that is not how pensions work. What about all the money I contributed to CPP all these years? If that money had been invested responsibly I wouldn't have to work just to keep a roof over my head today.  I am more than willing to bet that 20 years from now that all you younger guys will be in the same boat and they will come up with a ""new"" pension plan so you can have enough to live on in your final years. I'm also willing to bet that Whinnie the POO and her cronies won't be worring about where their next meal will be coming from!"
912201,Grimace,2015-04-24 23:12:00,2020,"CPP and a new Provincial Plan are not the same.  The money you you put in the CPP went to the CPP.  How would you expect to get a cheque from a different plan  If a provincial plan starts then we start contributing now.  When we retire we will get our CPP and our PPP.  We will have contributed to both and received benefit from both.  The provincial plan is not replacing the federal plan.  You still get your money from CPP, the plan you contibuted to.  If I go at 60, my retirement date is December 30th 2036.  It falls on a Monday, I have already told my boss I won`t be in on the Friday.  Should I choose to go to 65 my retirement date is on December 30th 2041.  It falls on a Tuesday and I have already notified my boss that I won`t be in on the Monday.  In either case the money I am depending on is a very healthy multi-employer pension plan where I invest much more and will receive much more.  Way better invested as well.  That`s what I am really banking on."

912296,Rod Caster,2015-04-25 13:01:00,5784,"I'll be glad to have another employer-matched pension plan. 100% immediate return...how many investments give you those returns, guaranteed??  I don't know all the details, but if it's managed properly like CPP, then it'll generate steady and secure returns. I like doing my own investing, but I'm fine with having my investments immediately matched.  CPP is about 4.5% employee contributed, and 4.5% employer  OPP is said to be 1.9% employee and 1.9% employer  I haven't had a cigarette in 3 months. In the first 10-15 days of each month I save approx. the equivalent of what my OPP contribution would be. Peanuts.  At some point in time, we'll see the OPP rolled into the CPP."
912366,SirCranksalot,2015-04-26 00:51:00,3291,"  At some point in time, we'll see the OPP rolled into the CPP.   yes, when we get a federal gov't which takes their concerns with seniors seriously!"

912373,SirCranksalot,2015-04-26 02:01:00,3291,"Another promise for retirement funds, from our Government, on the backs of small business owners!  I think you could make that very same argument against CPP. Do you think the CPP is a bad idea as well?"
911986,Big Cliff,2015-04-23 21:09:00,6899,"Does anyone understand how this is going to work?  Will it affect people like myself that already collect CPP and Old Age Security? Will it work like the CPP and be based on how much you contributed? Will everyone be entitled to it even if you haven't contributed? Will it be based on your current income? Any idea of how much extra it might contribute to our pension income?  I currently get just under $1200.00 a month combined CPP and old age security. What does a single mother living on welfare get? (I'm not trying to start a fight about it,  I'm just curious)"
911987,manitoubass2,2015-04-23 21:15:00,11391,"Good question...  Im interested to here the answer(s)  Boy oh boy thats all you get is $1200/month? Thats insane.  My gramps, bless his soul, got somewhere in the neighborhood of $2500/month 12 years or so ago.  With his house paid off plus savings, he lived good in retirement."

912002,DRIFTER_016,2015-04-23 22:45:00,10439,Glad I have a healthy govt. pension to collect when I retire.

912009,Raf,2015-04-23 23:26:00,3495,the max cpp + oas is somewhere around 1500-1600 unless there's a disability? pls correct me if i am wrong.  my understanding of the ontario pension plan as its currently proposed is its a sort of forced rrsp.. you contribute 1.9% of your first 90k and your employer matches.  those contributions are invested in who-knows-what by a third party  i've not really fully digested it all and dont have an opinion one way or another on it yet.  i've been a good little saver all my life and a part of me says i'd rather keep my 1.9% and control it myself.
912016,G.mech,2015-04-23 23:52:00,830,I would rather take care of my own money and invest it as I see fit.  Kathleen and her predecessors don't really have a great track record when it comes to caring for my hard earned money. This is just another 'revenue tool' for them to squander on their next boondoggle.
912017,Big Cliff,2015-04-24 00:06:00,6899,"Well, when I figure out what I contributed to CPP all these years (and I still do BTW) If I live to 250 I might get back everything I contributed. Funny how they keep talking about the CPP running out of money but they never talk about their pensions running out."
912019,manitoubass2,2015-04-24 00:14:00,11391,Probably included his Boise pension now that I think of it
912022,Paudash,2015-04-24 00:22:00,273,Why would the government think they can invest my better than me They have such a good record of money management
912070,Mister G,2015-04-24 09:44:00,1429,"Well, when I figure out what I contributed to CPP all these years (and I still do BTW) If I live to 250 I might get back everything I contributed.

912110,manitoubass2,2015-04-24 15:26:00,11391,Welfare is a pretty crappy standard of living.  Ontario works program is pretty gnarly.  Nobody is living well on ontario works unless they are doing something they arent supposed too.
912111,BillM,2015-04-24 15:27:00,17367,"Have 4 kids, go on welfare.. Trust me you'd like the cheques coming in."
912112,manitoubass2,2015-04-24 15:33:00,11391, Its enough to feed your kids trust me
912113,manitoubass2,2015-04-24 15:35:00,11391,And child tax benefits is a whole other story.
912115,lew,2015-04-24 15:44:00,12766,"Have 4 kids, go on welfare.. Trust me you'd like the cheques coming in.  I've said it here before, but I have a 70 year old cousin who has been on welfare her entire life and has never worked one single day since she was born.  She's never been married but has 6 kids with 6 different men and told me I was completely stupid to work for a living as welfare treats her very well.  As far as she's concerned, welfare is just a normal way of life that pays her quite well and it's much easier than getting up every day and working your butt off."
912121,manitoubass2,2015-04-24 16:15:00,11391,"Lotsa people do that. Do I like it? Nope  But it does not pay well lol.  These types of people have very low standards of living.  And it sounds like she has an incompitant worker.  Where is her participation agreement? There is zero chance shes participating the way should is legally obligated too.  And bill, here is a few numbers for two parents with 4 kids.  793 per month in max shelter out of that you must also pay gas and hydro  463 for basic needs  You can only have 7000 in assets and can own a home and one vehicle .  You must form a participation agreement that includes proof of looking for work, attending courses which make you more employable. Failure to meet anything in your participation agreement means no cheque, at all"
912122,manitoubass2,2015-04-24 16:16:00,11391,Thats hardly killing it at life lol
912123,manitoubass2,2015-04-24 16:19:00,11391,And to those low enough to live off their childrens child tax are in for a harsh wake up 18 years later with zero skills and no work experience
912124,BillM,2015-04-24 16:31:00,17367,"Sure beats working for a living like the most of us do.   Sit at home, collect welfare.  Way too many people do this and get away with it, makes me sick to my stomach knowing my taxes go to supporting these lowlifes.   I realize it happens, and people fall on hard times.  That's exactly what welfare is for, helping people get back on their feet and back into the work force."
