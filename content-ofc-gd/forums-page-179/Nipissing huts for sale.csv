And there are three up for grabs this year. The Municipality of Callander is now accepting sealed bids for purchase of any of the three ice shacks until May 5 at noon. Ray Marshall, public works manager and engineer for Callander said this is the second year unclaimed ice huts have been sold and profits go back to the municipality. He said the municipality issues reminders to hut owners that they have a certain period of time to claim their ice shacks and after the notice period has ended they become municipal property. “We sell them off via a silent auction. Last year we sold five huts and one went for $300. We had another one which was left with a sizable amount of gear inside to include an ice auger and top-ups,” Marshall said Monday. “We're receiving a lot of calls from interested people and businesses in the ice fishing industry this year.” Marshall said the quality of huts varies, however last year all five went to bidders regardless of their condition. This year's lot looks pretty good. Some of the huts have furniture and equipment still inside and in good condition. The municipality requires successful bidders to pay the cost of their purchase in full prior to retrieval. Purchased ice huts have to be removed by May 14 at 3:30 p.m. [email protected]"
