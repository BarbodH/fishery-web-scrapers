911707,GBW,2015-04-22 19:16:00,8460,I just shaped a 'faux cork' wine cork the other day thinking I need some better floats for the price. Nice going B!
911815,SirCranksalot,2015-04-23 02:23:00,3291,"Some great craftsmanship in this post....  Just wanna say.   Yeah, no kidding.  I'm not familiar with wood lathes at all. The only lathes I've seen were used for machining metal. For metal, as most of you know, the cutting tool is held in some sort of jig that allows the dist from the tool to the centerline of the work to be adjusted. It looks like you just hold the sanding block in your hand as the wood turns, correct?  Great idea with the drills, Drifter. Your skill look a lot more advanced than mine though, so I don't know if I could build a lathe out of old drill(s).  Re cedar--- I have some of that from a tree that was cut down on my property. Looking on-line I see that it's only about 20% more dense than balsa, so I might give it a try with that."
911819,DRIFTER_016,2015-04-23 02:31:00,10439,"My Prazzi lathe is a metal lathe. You can see the tool holder, the blue cutting tool is mounted in it. The tool holder is a turret tool holder that rotates. It can hold a few different cutters @ the same time and rotates so you can use the tool you want.  I used to get most of my balsa @ Hobby Hobby in Streetsville. I actually got a batch last time I came to visit. Really need to do something with it."

Correct  found this image on the internet http://www.rockler.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/Lathe-Sanding-Speed.jpg  Re cedar--- I have some of that from a tree that was cut down on my property. Looking on-line I see that it's only about 20% more dense than balsa, so I might give it a try with that.  I use the local eastern white cedar because I think it is a bit more dense than the western red cedar - just my feeling when working with this wood"
911926,Sinker,2015-04-23 15:49:00,8692,"Bluegill, I make my own slip floats VERY similar to yours. I use them mostly thru the ice. One thing I like to do is use a small snap on the bottoms, instead of (what looks like) the wire you use. The snap makes them removeable, so I can take them on/off as I please. Comes in handy a lot. I always have a bobber stop on my rigs, just in case I need it, and often find myself using the stop to mark depths, especially suspending fish like crappies and lakers, where the fish are. Works pretty slick.  S."

But it's more fun for me to fish with a bit nicer float...  "
911990,SirCranksalot,2015-04-23 21:27:00,3291,I'm mucking about with this sort of thing too. I just bent a wire up so that I can push the line into a hole/slot and it stays there. I could show you a pic except it's so small that the detail might be lost.

Your comments on anything I need to improve or change, would be helpful.  floats 011f.jpg  floats 002f.jpg  The total cost on material was $14 and change.

909902,misfish,2015-04-13 20:23:00,29133,"Are you using one piece for the stem, which can sometimes be hard to drill through both centers, at the top and bottom or using 2 pieces, which is much easier to drill into both centers, drilling halfway or almost to the halfway point and gluing both pieces into the float body. The latter is much easier, and centers well  I started out trying to make them with one stem, but found the bit was going off center. So now Im going in from both ends. Quick and easy.  Thats a sweet set up. Mind if I try making one like that? I am looking for some kind of decal I can put on mine as well. Nice job there.   No slip tube necessary. Just one ring at the end of the float. Way better than through the whole float. You can easy make the ring and secure with a bit of shrink tube. This float I made from eastern cedar, always use it as slip float.    "

911361,SirCranksalot,2015-04-21 02:44:00,3291, with wine corks you are limited with the size also the surface is not as nice to turn like wood   What tools do you to shape the cork/ thx
911365,DRIFTER_016,2015-04-21 03:22:00,10439,"I use a home made lathe to turn my floats. I also turn my rod handle cork on it. The lathe is made from 2 old Makita battery drills. The head stock has the motor in it. It is cooled by 2 computer fans as I am running it @ 12 volts and it's a 7.2 volt motor. The tail stock is just chuck and support bearings, no motor. I run it off either a 12 volt power supply or one of my 12 volt batteries. Shaping floats is done with various grades of sandpaper glued to pieces of MDF or aluminium. Shaping my rod handles is done first with chisels and finished using the sandpaper.    I turn my floats on a mandrel made of 6-32 threaded rod with threaded sleeves to hold in the chucks.      My real seat inserts are done on this bad boy!!!!  "

I havent tried yet,but will let you know.These are a starting point for me. I can only get better once I have used them.

Drill a 1/8"" or smaller hole through and glue a plastic tube in there. Put some super size chamfers on the tube and you are in business. Take a look at ravens balsa slip floats. I like them. But the plastic tube is too soft and line cuts it... I found putting a chamfer on the tube made a huge difference. Sail sells another brand of slip floats with a brass collar at either end. They work too but the tube method is probably best for DIY float making."
