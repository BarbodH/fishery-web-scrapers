912303,lew,2015-04-25 14:44:00,12766,"Looks like you scored yourself a great boat, best of luck with her."
912311,Freshtrax,2015-04-25 15:50:00,2215,"Thanks , I would  not have dreamed about getting a boat of this vintage if I wasn't mechanically inclined.   So far the labour bill at a marina would have been 3 x what I paid for it.  The stringers are a little damp but not rotten,   The motor mounts still take a good torque."
912315,Mister G,2015-04-25 16:29:00,1429,A boat is a watercraft of any size that is actually a hole in the water you continue to pour money into.
912316,fishindevil,2015-04-25 16:53:00,6254,The big truck will knowing how far in to back your trailer and where the sweet spot for the boat is !!! And of course the same for putting her back on the trailer as well !!! Like Steve said take your time and  double & triple check everything and then check it again !!! Check tire inflation & your hitch & rollers make sure after you launch they are all working ect. Ect .     And have fun .... Waiting to hear how things went and see some pics !!!! )
913164,Freshtrax,2015-05-01 00:20:00,2215,"Getting close.  2 new batteries, and a sonar today...   All I really need to do is mount the brake controller in the truck.   Hoping for a Sunday  shakedown cruise."
913170,Pikeslayer,2015-05-01 00:42:00,1443,Sweet lookin ride FT . Looking forward to a journey this season
913171,Freshtrax,2015-05-01 00:47:00,2215,You know your welcome any time!
912051,Freshtrax,2015-04-24 02:43:00,2215,"It all started one fateful summer day 3 years ago .   We met him at the docks bright and early for my first ever taste of lake ont. Fishing.  We motored out   It was a slow start and I was wary of our witty captain   But soon the action started           And soon our arms were sore and we were begging to quit     But our captain would not let us stop until we had double digits of fish for our morning charter     This was the genesis of my obsession  Over the next few years I used many coping mechanisms such as buying my first boat, only just big enough to get out on lake O on the finest of days.        Hitched rides with buddies       But but there was only one solution to spiral of obsession   http://s101.photobucket.com/user/aninaa/media/image.jpg1_zpseemo60wp.jpg.html][/   This was taken the day I dragged her  home, she now sits tuned up , lower unit gone through, waxed and washed with a 15 hp kicker and a new mooring cover ready to go, as soon as work and weather cooperate  I would like to give some big thanks to a few members for helping me along the way  Fisherpete   Thanks for the trips out and aiding in my addiction as well as the great deals on many rods reels rod holders ect.  Pikeslayer for the trips out , and teaching me a bunch.  And all others that have sold me stuff to get her rigged.   Now to catch a fish and name her.  Tight lines.  I have a feeling this is only the beginning,"
912055,joeybacala,2015-04-24 03:12:00,63,I share your pain lol... I too tried charter fishing and it was incredible. Your pics are great and I hope you get to go often. More  importantly with a lot of continued success and memories. Good luck and keep posting those great pics.
912056,irishfield,2015-04-24 03:16:00,26272,Wife figured out where to park her car yet??
912057,Old Ironmaker,2015-04-24 03:16:00,8243,"Freshtrax, you have it bad. There isn't any rehab or prescribed meds that will save you now. Where you not warned that Great Lake fishing is incurable? Oh the tragedy of another lost young soul to longline trolling. You might as well get over here to Erie and start pulling harnesses for the average 10 pound Pickerel. I am really sorry to hear about this, I really am.  Nice barge by the way."
912060,PUMP KNOWS,2015-04-24 03:28:00,937,Good stuff Freshtrax!
912061,porkpie,2015-04-24 03:43:00,2521,"As a friend of mine always says "". It's only money, you can always make more"".  Nice boat!"
912068,Mister G,2015-04-24 09:10:00,1429,Wife figured out where to park her car yet?? Car.....hahaha.....he traded that useless vehicle in for the LO boat....but now she has unlimited use to that nice new bus that's only 8 short blocks away .....
912071,spincast,2015-04-24 09:57:00,3279,"LO Addicts everywhere   been addicted since 2010 and got there pretty much the same way too. Congrats on the new ride,a  bluezoner special with lots of room for rods - sweet. Pikeslayer talk you into the sub troll too?  Look forward to this years reports - now if mother nature will just start to play a little bit better- a week or two of some consistent warm temps and mild West winds"
912089,manjo39,2015-04-24 12:52:00,354,Now to catch a fish and name her.  Tight lines.   So you're naming her 'Tight lines'?   I will not go Lake O fishing ... I will not go Lake O fishing ...  I will not go Lake O fishing.
912093,Ven-Pisc-ator,2015-04-24 13:27:00,39,"Nice; Funny how a good day fishing hooks people for life.  Ven PS I always like it when the kids are introduced early to the sport.  They tend to be ""obsessed"" longer. Thanks for sharing."
912108,fishnsled,2015-04-24 15:02:00,3520,"First - I blame Joe for my trolling addiction/obsession.  It all started with an 11.5 pound walleye one fall, many years ago.  LOL!  It also created a friendship for life.  A win win I'd say.  Second - We need more pictures of the new ride!  Looks great!  You're in good company with all of us addicts here."
912162,Moosebunk,2015-04-24 20:33:00,3970,"Nothing like reel peel... and that tug which becomes the drug, which then leaves us chasing our addictions for the rest of our days.  That rig oughtta really help you with your fishing problem. Enjoy dood!"
912165,fishindevil,2015-04-24 20:50:00,6254,Awesome !!! Yes you have it bad too !!!! I have been fishing Lake Ontario for over 30yrs !!!! It is the drug for sure !!!!! I was first mate and co-captain on a charter boat for years !!!!!! It's very addicting and it will only get worse !!!! Lol ....good luck !!!! And we are waiting for the first fish-porn pics and reports !!!!! The sound if that drag screaming on a 25lb king going southbound when you are going northbound is incredible !!! Whoooooooooo hoooooooo !!!!!!! ))))
912167,misfish,2015-04-24 21:00:00,29133,Looks Lake O worthy for sure.   Enjoy.
912193,Fisherpete,2015-04-24 22:31:00,1814,"Hope the new ride and gear see plenty of Tyee filled action in the years to come! I've only been doing the Lake O thing the past two years, it's a blast, and so close - perfect for weekday evenings after a day of work.  How about ""The Tyee-tanic"" LOL! Ok, not my best idea...  Cheers Pete"
912194,Steve,2015-04-24 22:36:00,2075,addict since 2005.  sweet ride! that'll handle Lake Ontario

912223,irishfield,2015-04-25 00:48:00,26272,That name's just asking for trouble Albert!
912232,Freshtrax,2015-04-25 01:19:00,2215,Thanks for all the kind words guys.  I'm not going to name her until I fish her a time to two but I have a few in mind.     I have to work Saturday but I think I'm going to take wednesday off and tow her to  hamilton for the maiden voyage.   Never loaded a boat this large on a trailer . It's a keel roller trailer with roller bunks. Any tips?
912242,Steve,2015-04-25 01:41:00,2075,"make sure you have two friends with you....take it slow....think a bit before you do every action.  it'll become second nature soon enough...for now, just take it easy and double check everything while launching and taking the boat out."
912254,irishfield,2015-04-25 02:14:00,26272,"Main tip.. do NOT undo that strap hook! Back it to waters edge with transom straps off, then loosen the winch strap to give no more than a foot of slack (so the boat can float off the post) and then make sure the winch is back in the locked postion before moving back into the water until she floats up off the rollers."
912258,Freshtrax,2015-04-25 02:20:00,2215,I heard some horror stories about that one... I will also make sure the drain plug is in... Been there done that.
912263,chris.brock,2015-04-25 02:39:00,4053,"I think it should have read- ""How a charter captain 'enriched' my life""  Looks like a lot of good times coming up out on the big lake, you only live once."
912265,Sinker,2015-04-25 03:01:00,8692,"I was thinking the same thing lol  As for launching, dont put the trailer too far in the water when loading the boat back on. Thats the #1 mistake I see people make at the boat launch. Getting her in the water shouldnt be too bad, but listen to Waynes advice for sure!  Good luck, have fun!  S."
912294,HTHM,2015-04-25 12:50:00,4082,I am happy to come by and assist if you wish.
