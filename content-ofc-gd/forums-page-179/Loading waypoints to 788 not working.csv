Saved waypoints to an sd card  Loaded into humminbird software  Saved back to sd card  788 gives option to load data  Select YES  says no new Nav data found     Tried the same on a 999 and loaded fine... Tried another 999 and fine...  Even updated the 788 and everything  For the life of me I can't understand what's wrong here,.,  I really don't want to enter 385 waypoints manually... Lol    Please oh please can anyone help or can anyone suggest who to call other then humminbird... I'll be calling them asap"
912397,SRR,2015-04-26 13:31:00,10,I've had similar issues with other units.  Some suggestions:  Is the firmware on your 788 up to date? You could also try using a lower capacity SD card.  Some units have memory and card size limitations. Try uploading fewer waypoints at one time.  Hope this helps.
912458,BillM,2015-04-26 22:11:00,17367,Did you make a 'Matrix' folder on the SD card and put your waypoints into that THEN try importing?  I bet it works
912498,mike rousseau,2015-04-27 01:35:00,4661,Yes Bill  Amazing idea SRR!!!  I'll try that...
912501,BillM,2015-04-27 01:49:00,17367,That's the only way I could import anything into my older 788.
