911651,123chadder,2015-04-22 15:52:00,165,"im going on a fly in late may and there are burbot in the lake,also whitefish,cisco and lakers.... i caught lots of trout last year with burbot in their bellies....no live bait(or dead bait)allowed on lake  does anyone know lures that resemble dogfish?id like to get a few...also something that resembles a whitefish or cisco?"
911653,Acountdeleted,2015-04-22 15:57:00,2562,The MEEGZ 'goby colour probably represents a ling well. Maybe larger smoke coloured tubes as well.
911657,Garfisher,2015-04-22 16:13:00,229,"You could always get an eel/reaper type bait like a Minda Spear Worm or Evolve Vibra Grub and rig it to have the tail vertical, would give a similar appearance to that of a burbot I would think"
911658,123chadder,2015-04-22 16:18:00,165,the spear worm looks good!
911660,Fang,2015-04-22 16:24:00,1330,"if it's like temagami the ling or burbot are all pretty decent size for the trout that eats them.  you can find small 6"" bulldawg clones on ebay that will work for what you're looking to do  4"" and 6"" tubes will do the trick too"
911662,kickingfrog,2015-04-22 16:30:00,8333,What about a lizard type plastic bait?

911702,OhioFisherman,2015-04-22 18:57:00,6623,"If I want to imitate a bait fish I usually go with a white tube with silver flecks, such as.  http://www.jannsnetcraft.com/netcraft-dominator-baits/530527.aspx#  I also used the Sculpins, a great lure on Lake Erie, on a jig head or drop shot."
