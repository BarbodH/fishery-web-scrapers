912747,jameshandz,2015-04-28 15:47:00,31,"HEY EVERYONE,  I JUST BOUGHT MY FIRST TRAILER UP ON PIGEON LAKE AND LUCKILY  A 14 FT TIN BOAT CAME WITH IT. NOT MUCH FOR SOME PEOPLE BUT WHEN I WAS LAND LOCKED LAST YEARS THIS MAKES A  HUGE DIFFERENCE. I HAVE A PLEASURE CRAFT OPERATORS CARD ALREADY BUT I WANT TO KNOW IF I PUT A 9.9 HP ON IT DO I NEED TO INSURE IT ON THE WATER? I WONT BE TRAILERING IT ANYWHERE AS I DONT HAVE ONE AN  IT STAYS THERE YEAR ROUND.  IF ANY ONE KNOWS THAT WOULD BE GREAT OUR IF YOU HAVE A LINK I CAN LOOKING INTO . EVERYWHERE IVE READ SOME PEOPLE SAY I NEED INSURANCE SOME PEOPLE SAY I DO NOT .  THANKS IN ADVANCE .  "
912748,Luke V.,2015-04-28 15:50:00,286,"I would say that yes you need it. And for peace of mind I would get some liability only insurance on it, for the ""just in case"" purposes. On my old 14' tinner I paid $120/year for $300,000 liability."
912749,Raf,2015-04-28 15:51:00,3495,it's not mandatory.  it does protect you in case of theft or damage to someone else or their property.
912751,Lape0019,2015-04-28 16:03:00,647,"Yeah,  It isn't needed, but it is always good piece of mind to have it. I know lots of people with similar setups that don't. I thought about running mine without but was quickly told the advantages and if I ever hit a rock or something, it will pay for itself."
912756,BillM,2015-04-28 16:37:00,17367,Insurance on a old 14ft tinny?  Why bother?  It's probably not worth the deductible.
912757,lookinforwalleye,2015-04-28 16:38:00,4399,Check you auto policy when I had a 14 ft tin boat it was covered by my auto policy....
912761,Sinker,2015-04-28 17:04:00,8692,"Not required, and I wouldn't bother.  S."
912762,Oggie,2015-04-28 17:13:00,588,It's covered under your house insurance when you're not towing it. Covered under your auto insurance when towing. I would inform my house insurance carrier only if its a very expensive boat that you'd want replaced if something happened. if it's a new boat worth a decent amount then I'd call your house insurance to see if it's covered and how much to cover it should it be stolen or catch fire.  I agree with Bill. Dan O.

912772,Paudash,2015-04-28 18:07:00,273,when you get your trailer insured it should be covered with that.  No sense in insuring the boat but you do want to be covered for liability when your bother takes his kid out for a quick spin and takes out another boat
912778,Tom McCutcheon,2015-04-28 18:47:00,627,"As you have already heard, it's not a requirement. However, I know of one good friend who was out fishing (anchored) and his wife almost lost her leg because someone in a ""14' Tinny with a 9.9"" ran into them at wide open throttle. He couldn't see them because he weighed 200lbs. and the bow of the boat was up in the air so far he had no idea what was ahead of him. He is thankful he had insurance. Just a word of caution and enough said."
912786,jameshandz,2015-04-28 19:20:00,31,"thanks everyone , im still gonna inquire about it to keep me safe out there"
912794,bare foot wader,2015-04-28 20:24:00,1354,if you fish smaller water bodies I wouldn't bother.....if you are on high traffic waters I'd say it's pretty affordable and nice to have protection
912825,Freshtrax,2015-04-28 22:22:00,2215,Your homeowners or renters umbrella should cover you for liability.   I wouldn't insure it for theft
