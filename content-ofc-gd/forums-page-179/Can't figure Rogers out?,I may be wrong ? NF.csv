I can get it on my two big hd TV's but not on the two smaller regular ones.I have the digital modem/box that allows you to watch shows to channel 65 or so.A couple a little further up as well on the two smaller ones.Seems odd to me ,may have to call,but thought I'd try here first.Thanks for any insight."

Hope that made sense"
912807,davey buoy,2015-04-28 21:26:00,5505,"Thanks,not sure that is what is happening in this instance.Well tonight is good,no hockey games.Last few games,tsn and sports net as well as cbc were all showing hockey,curling ,under 18 etc.I'm thinking that channel 18 is a temporary thing?.Even after a auto scan it went right on by.lol. Not a big deal,can't believed they may of missed this."
