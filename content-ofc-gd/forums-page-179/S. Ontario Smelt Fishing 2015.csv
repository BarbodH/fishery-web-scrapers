912767,PUMP KNOWS,2015-04-28 17:39:00,937,How long does the smelt run last for?
912831,MistyHollow,2015-04-28 23:03:00,21,"Usually a week to two weeks with a couple of good strong nights. The run usually starts shortly after ice out, sometimes there will still be off shore ice."
912853,PUMP KNOWS,2015-04-29 01:01:00,937,Thanks!  I remember when I was a kid and joined my uncle on a smelt fishing trip.  I liked helping to catch them but I was never a fan of eating them.
