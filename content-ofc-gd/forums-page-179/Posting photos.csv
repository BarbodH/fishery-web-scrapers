912297,captpierre,2015-04-25 13:24:00,2521,"So. Now that I finally broke down and have a decent phone with Internet,  I'd like to get ready to post some fish porn. Can somebody pleased tell me  how to do that from my phone? Thanks. Peter"
912298,Terry,2015-04-25 13:28:00,14456,i found an easy way was with the photobucket app or if you have facebook you can upload to facebook then link to the post
912357,captpierre,2015-04-25 23:59:00,2521,"So Terry, how do I link from FB to a post"
912358,Terry,2015-04-26 00:07:00,14456,you go to the photo  view photo right mouse click and copy photo location  then paste photo in ofc post  with image icon
912363,FloatnFly,2015-04-26 00:37:00,1640,"you go to the photo  view photo right mouse click and copy photo location  then paste photo in ofc post  with image icon   except, hes using a phone, not a computer.   get the photobucket app"
912367,Terry,2015-04-26 00:58:00,14456,you are right facebook  much harder on a phone  thats why i use photobucket
912381,Sinker,2015-04-26 04:13:00,8692,I cant get phhotobucket to work for me anymore. It drives me nuts. Whats the trick?
912382,Sinker,2015-04-26 04:16:00,8692,"Test  http://rs24.pbsrc.com/albums/c15/Sinker1975/Mobile%20Uploads/IMG_20150114_165623_edit_zps06ad6242.jpg~320x480  See....stupid phone.  I cant figure it out on this phone using the mobile skin, on the mobile photobucket. And this keyboard sucks ass!!!!"
912383,Sinker,2015-04-26 04:19:00,8692,Nope....doesnt work.  Can anyone post pics from a blackberry Q10??  S.
912418,SirWhite,2015-04-26 17:08:00,210,"Just had to figure this out last week. Google an image hosting site. Create an account, upload photos. a few different links will be created and shown on new page. Choose one less than 800*600 in size, copy the link (the one u want will have [ this at the beginning of the link and an ] at the end) those are the magic symbols that put the pic on the forum"
912422,Terry,2015-04-26 17:37:00,14456,Nope....doesnt work.  Can anyone post pics from a blackberry Q10??  S. you are close  you need to get the right image location  you should be able to click on share link then direct then in your post   click the image button  and paste
912423,misfish,2015-04-26 17:41:00,29133,"I like the  link you gave me a year ago to resize.  Save,s having to use photobucket all the time."
912432,Sinker,2015-04-26 18:39:00,8692,"Its not me, its this stupid phone. I can post from my PC no problem, but I hardly use the PC anymore. I've always used photobucket, never a problem.  S."
912448,Terry,2015-04-26 21:27:00,14456,"if you switch from mobile to full websites, it should be the same as doing it from the pc   maybe..."
912472,Sinker,2015-04-26 23:09:00,8692,"Tried it, wont work that way for me either. Nobody else uses a blackberry?"
912503,Joeytier,2015-04-27 01:57:00,3990,"I use the website on my Nokia Lumia no problems, and used the app on my iPhone, also never an issue, surprisingly enough"
912520,fishindevil,2015-04-27 09:44:00,6254,Take a pic then upload to photobucket and click the image and copy then paste to ofc takes about 30 seconds !! Lol you have to upload to photobucket from your camera roll on your phone it's the way I have been doing it for years in my phone I hardly ever do it from my puter it's always from my phone once you do it a few times it's very easy
912524,manitoubass2,2015-04-27 10:34:00,11391,"From mobile, at least on android, when you select the photo on phtobucket it gives four codes, click the last one.  Then copy/paste into your post on ofc"
912528,Sinker,2015-04-27 11:47:00,8692,"Yeah, I upload to PB, copy the IMG link, and it doesnt work on this phone. No prob from PC."
912530,manitoubass2,2015-04-27 12:08:00,11391,"Darn technology lol.  I went from iphone 4 to galaxy s5 like 7 months ago and im still learning what this phone can do haha(besides tell me I walked 22,000 steps yesterday)"
