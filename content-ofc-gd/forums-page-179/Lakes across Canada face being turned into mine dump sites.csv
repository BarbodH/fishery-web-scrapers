When we dont have any fresh water left..http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/lakes-across-canada-face-being-turned-into-mine-dump-sites-1.733972Lakes proposed for use as mine tailings ponds: Since the introduction of Schedule Two of mining effluent regulations under the Fisheries Act, in 2002, 16 lakes have been proposed for reclassification as tailings dumps. Four of the 16 are already being used as dumps — all in Newfoundland. Two of those are at the Duck Pond Mine and the other two are older mines due to be brought under Schedule Two retroactively. Only one of the 16 — Kemess North in B.C. — has been turned down. Eight are to be decided in the coming year. B.C.: Manitoba: Newfoundland and Labrador: Northwest Territories: Nunavut:"

912866,tb4me,2015-04-29 01:39:00,3295,"this statement got me fired right up......""This is a precedent-setting decision by the federal government to start using fish-bearing habitat as a waste management area,"" Bourquin said. ""It's totally bizarre for the federal government to come here and say that this Y-shaped valley up here is no longer a fish habitat, it's no longer sacred headwaters, it's just a waste dump site."""
912867,Pikeslayer,2015-04-29 01:54:00,1443,"Thanks for posting TB, very informative. Major concerns here especially considering the long term:  ""Once they do the mine, they’re going to leave, and we're the people who are going to live with that. Not me, but my grandchildren, the small little kids like this. That's who's going to live with the pollution.""  However after reading the news link, I did fail to see the direct reference to ""Harper is perfectly ok with this crap."" ?????"

I think the main thing is we all know better these days, but some continue to be allowed to make money doing so if it suits the share holders pocket..... while the rest of us pay to dispose of stuff properly (me $161 at the transfer station today with garbage and drywall from the son's house)"

Will that be the Baby Boomers generations legacy to our country. Unfortunately I believe it may be. How can we change our tune?  edit: that CBC report is from 2008, I wonder what the lakes and rivers effected look like today?"
