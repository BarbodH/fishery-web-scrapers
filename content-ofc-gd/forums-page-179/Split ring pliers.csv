912882,SirCranksalot,2015-04-29 02:48:00,3291,I'd like to replace the trebles on some of my lures with single Siwash hooks. The pair of pliers I have now don't work too well---I don't know what brand offhand. Can anybody recommend a type well suited for this application? thx
912883,DRIFTER_016,2015-04-29 02:54:00,10439,These are pretty decent for the price.  http://www.basspro.com/Bass-Pro-Shops-6-Deluxe-Split-Ring-Pliers/product/8547/#chart-container
912885,mike rousseau,2015-04-29 03:04:00,4661,I use these and like em  http://www.muskyshop.com/modules/cart/products.php/keys/Plier/page/1/id/2277/name/SplitRingPliers512XuronBluegrip
912886,tender52,2015-04-29 03:04:00,270,"Ive only used wire strippers for installing new rings or hook replacement.  The ends of the strippers are fine enough to get into the grooves, a quick turn of the wrist and the hook or split rings slide right out"

912911,Garnet,2015-04-29 11:39:00,2056,The Shimano small ones are my favorite. With the bent fingers. Small enough to do smaller split ring and a little easier to see.  And I have a pair from CTC little smaller than drifters I think. They came in blue for $11.99 and pink for $4.99. Mine are pink.  Just cheap.  Those one Mike use don't grip the smaller spilt ring but the are the best for cleaning paint from jig eyes. Always have a pair in boat.
912912,npt1,2015-04-29 11:41:00,220,This is an easy way to open split rings. 
912913,SirCranksalot,2015-04-29 11:45:00,3291,Thx guys. I'll have to try that stapler remover before I look for another pair.  Or maybe find some pink Shimanos !
912920,PUMP KNOWS,2015-04-29 12:28:00,937,Nice... I was looking for split ring pliers.  I was thinking of finding some in a arts and crafts store.
912952,dave524,2015-04-29 16:45:00,4508,Most siwash hooks I've encountered had the ring eye slightly open so that you only had to pinch it slightly to close the gap on the ring. Didn't have to thread them on.
912962,SirCranksalot,2015-04-29 17:28:00,3291,but I need pliers to remove the trebles.
912965,Sinker,2015-04-29 17:38:00,8692,If the trebles are pooched its easier to cut them off.  S.
