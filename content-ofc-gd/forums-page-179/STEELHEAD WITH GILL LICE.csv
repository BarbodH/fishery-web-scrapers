913054,PUMP KNOWS,2015-04-30 12:52:00,937,Have you guys noticed lots of steelhead with gill lice this spring?  Here's a pic of one we caught recently   
913060,BillM,2015-04-30 13:09:00,17367,"Seen it a bunch of times, doesn't appear to affect them at all."
913063,Gallie,2015-04-30 13:51:00,1215,"Ive seen a few out in the big lake over the years, we released one that seemed a little more sluggish then the rest and he was infested with them. He still went on his way though."
913065,Acountdeleted,2015-04-30 13:58:00,2562,We were getting a lot of those last year and taking samples. If you'd like I can put you into contact with someone at the TRCA that was looking into it.
913082,esoxansteel,2015-04-30 15:24:00,1307,"Gill lice is a growing concern, and is showing up more frequently in catches, and sampling, not much mention of it from MNR or there biologist, but this is the year they were supposed to sample Ganny fish, so thery will no doubt see first hand for themselves instead of taking anglers words, common within some Brook Trout populations and almost always fatal, I would assume it would choke the fishes ability to breath through the gills if it gets bad enough"
913094,Ven-Pisc-ator,2015-04-30 16:29:00,39,"I have not seen them on the fish I have taken, but I did not specifically look for them.  I will check the next fish I catch."
913106,Acountdeleted,2015-04-30 18:04:00,2562,"From what I remember last year, the Steelhead and brown trout were uncommon (1 in ever 3 to 1 in 5 fish) but Chinooks were baaaaad. Almost every fish had them."
913111,PUMP KNOWS,2015-04-30 18:49:00,937,I've only been steelheading for 2 years and this my first time seeing them
