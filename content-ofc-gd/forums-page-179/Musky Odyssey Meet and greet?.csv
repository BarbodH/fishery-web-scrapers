911245,TenInchJake,2015-04-20 17:28:00,21,"Wish I could be there but I have other obligations that I need to attend to in Kingston on the 25th. I will be sending a some money to the Odyssey though, and trusting my brother to spend it frivolously. I would really like to see John Anderson's presentation. Going to Ottawa later this year. I like that St. Clair, Georgian Bay, Nippissing and Ottawa River are all represented by the presenters. Good job by the organizing committee."
911250,lew,2015-04-20 17:41:00,12766,I would really like to see John Anderson's presentation.  A few years back I spent an evening sitting in John Andersons living room yakking about muskies with him.  Very nice guy and extremely knowledgable about muskies.
911303,F_ast,2015-04-20 23:02:00,154,I will be there
911808,Handlebarz,2015-04-23 02:00:00,3790,Looking forward to meeting new Ofc membersFast stop by the booth.
912324,Raycaster,2015-04-25 18:18:00,528,"Big thanks to Mike for spending some time with this ""musky newbie"". Man, I had to get out of there or I would of badgered him all day. I felt like Columbo, "" just one more question...""  Also thanks out to the Bondy crew for setting me straight with planar board information. Jon spent a good 20 minutes explaining the LSC technique of trolling for the big boys.  Pretty amazing being able to talk to the ""Pro's"" and realize they really do want to help and still enjoy the sport.  Lots of great people there and anyone thinking of going should definitely run down asap."
912326,Spiel,2015-04-25 18:44:00,9065,Ran into some old friends and met some new friends in the 3 hours I wondered about. A great event packed with some extremely talented and knowledgeable people.

907437,Handlebarz,2015-04-01 12:05:00,3790,Hey all I was wondering how many people will be staying over night for the odyssey? if you are will it be Friday or Saturday? we will be there all weekend I thought this might be a good time to have a M&G in St.Cathrines (Dax fix my spelling) there are always a bunch of people that come up every year and stay over but head off in all directions after the Odyssey I have heard from many who just went for dinner then back to their room as they did not know what to do. If there is enough interest we can work on something.  If there is not that many we will just catch up during the show.
907440,lew,2015-04-01 12:26:00,12766,We always had some good times getting together for breakfast or dinner after the show Mike. I won't be attending this year but hopefully everybody has a great time.
907441,Handlebarz,2015-04-01 12:39:00,3790,Oh yeah lew we did have good eats before and after. Always great to visit with old friends
907445,lew,2015-04-01 13:00:00,12766,"Hope you do well with your baits too Mike.  Not sure if I even told you before, but this 51""er came on that blue/silver & chrome blade bucktail you gave me that morning at Mr. Sub. in Belle  River.  "

907795,Handlebarz,2015-04-03 00:30:00,3790,Steve if you get down here I'm sure we can try the fly I have two awesome musky flys that I would love to try out. Young Chris made them for me and I want to get out with them. I brought him over to the mci table at the spring fishing boat show and the guys loved his work. I don't think Chris was ready to sell his flys but the guys wanted to buy them. He does awesome work.  There are alot of big gar here that would love the flys.
907811,Bondar,2015-04-03 03:16:00,817,I'll be there live right up the street

908126,Pigeontroller,2015-04-04 23:51:00,2793,One ticket includes spouse and children...
908285,Handlebarz,2015-04-05 23:18:00,3790,Hard to beat a days entertainment for the family and only $15 I know the last time I had many families come over to the booth when I asked if they got in for the family pricing all of them were very happy that they did.
908319,outllaw,2015-04-06 11:23:00,1232,wow you guys did great. for families that's a great deal for a day out.
908340,SuperDave,2015-04-06 14:30:00,204,"The Odyssey is one great Canadian Muskie show! The cool thing is the access you will have to all the specialized bait makers out there. Don't miss it, only comes around every second year!"
908716,cowanjo,2015-04-08 00:55:00,249,"Guys will be away one of my favourite shows of the year, going to be great wish I could make it.
