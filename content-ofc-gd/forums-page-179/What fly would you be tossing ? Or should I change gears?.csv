912196,misfish,2015-04-24 22:52:00,29133,"Crazy weather. Makes one think twice, hell even three, four times on what to do for the opener.  With this rain and snow the last few days, Im wondering what would be hatching in the waters? Im talking creeks and streams.  Do I just leave the fly rod in the truck, and sport the spinning gear, or swing maybe a black stone fly nymph?  It,s been a real weather front challange. Even for one thats not fly savey. LOL  If anyone says take the toon out for crappie,I would not say no.LOL"

912239,creditmaster,2015-04-25 01:31:00,190,hey if you want to swing by the credit in brampton the waters clear and full of fish we would be fishing private land mostly pm me
912248,Christopheraaron,2015-04-25 02:03:00,3525,"Nothing will be hatching for 3 weeks anyways (nothing we care about at least), stones are a good bet, the caddis still exist as well, can't go wrong with a streamer too (just go small and slow to start)."
912321,misfish,2015-04-25 17:39:00,29133,"Well, all I can say is WOW. Waters so close to me and never even thought of fishing it. Water was very cold,the air temps the same. I fished a few spots and nothing. Tried flys and spinners. I was fishing resident fish. Another opener that is screwed up by the weather I think.  I even stopped on the way back home and tried my fav  resident brown spot. Not even a sucker to be seen.  I would like to thank a member here for the lead. Thanks you for that.   Once the temps start to warm up a bit,Im going to head back there and try again. Miles of river to fish."
912329,Garnet,2015-04-25 19:55:00,2056,Wasn't a slam fess but lot's caught. Just about everything worked. Tomorrow when the breal trout fishing starts. I'm going perchn.

912461,BillM,2015-04-26 22:19:00,17367,"Need some warm weather, those resident fish aren't going to move for much, lol.   I think I'll fish crappies the next week or so."
912477,Garnet,2015-04-27 00:08:00,2056,As predicted little tougher today. By the lack of cars on 28 and Sylvan Glen I would guess it was a bust yesterday. I get to fish the trout club it was OK.  Expect great drop back fishing in a week to 10 days.

912523,Garnet,2015-04-27 10:11:00,2056,They must have been coming and going quicker. About 8-9 at Dale rd and 1 at Hwy 28 at 8:30 and maybe 15 at Dale and 6 at 28 when I left at 12:30.  Slower for me on Sunday mostly talking to people I see once a year.
