912169,PBenson,2015-04-24 21:03:00,154,The Detroit River Walleye fishing has been crazy lately but I planned a trip to Florida a month ago so I had to take a break from the walleye fishing. Below is a video of the Blacktip I caught. If anyone ever has the chance to fish for these things I highly recommend it. Their power is incredible!
