909614,Steve,2015-04-12 15:32:00,2075,do it right.  $100 is nothing if your planning on keeping the boat for another 10 years.
909624,fish_fishburn,2015-04-12 16:14:00,1311,Wrap it up and go fishing. The floor will be awesome.
909626,HTHM,2015-04-12 16:18:00,4082,"As others have suggested, coat the underside with fiberglass and resin to act as both a sealer and a barrier from the corrosive action of the PT wood."
909644,Mister G,2015-04-12 16:56:00,1429,"Since you already have the pressure treated wood I would just isolated the contact points using some FREE material you probably already have laying around your house, plastic.......old milk containers or other plastic type bottles, containers placed between the wood and support brackets will out last the boat.  I'm guessing you don't store this boat inside and that's why the floor rotted. Have you taken a closer look at the transom as that is usually the next thing to go on a aluminum boat that is stored outside. This new floor will easily outlast that transom and by then you might be in the market for a NEW fishing machine."
909688,porkpie,2015-04-12 21:32:00,2521,"I think ventilation is the key.  The guy who put floor vents in, that was a great idea.  We got soaked in the boat on Wednesday, and yesterday I yanked the cover off and opened all the hatches to make sure it dried.  I'm thinking of redoing the boat I just bought in vinyl eventually.  There is nothing wrong with the carpet now, so no rush but If I do it I'll definately install a couple of vents.  Looking forward to seeing the final product!"
912706,mike rousseau,2015-04-28 11:13:00,4661,Jobs done  I undead up staying with the pressure treated... I coated it in urithane and sprayed the boat with a rubber spray...  So I guess time will tell if that was a good move or not...  The pics I have don't have the seats in yet but I got them in yesterday... I was able to move the seats to a WAY better location... New tillers are longer then old... Now my tiller won't hit my seat...  Evrything went very well and the results were better then expected....  Used vinyl and glue from cabelas... After glueing we wrapped the vinyl around 4-6 inches all the way around and stapled it underneath...      
912710,Mister G,2015-04-28 11:33:00,1429,Looks like you were busier then a 2 peckered billy goat......nice job.  Now go catch a fish
912712,lew,2015-04-28 11:36:00,12766,"Looking really good Mike, very nice job."
912728,Sinker,2015-04-28 12:55:00,8692,"Nice! Love the tiller boats. Look at all that room to fish!! Nice job. You won't have any issues with the PT, don't worry.  S."
912746,bare foot wader,2015-04-28 15:45:00,1354,"looks sharp! well done  with regards to the foam, my boat has taken on a lot water before I installed a float switch on the bilge pump...I'm planning to redo my floors soon, how do you test the foam? I would imagine the surface would appear dry, do you drill to the center to check for moisture? I think pouring foam might be a smarter idea for my boat"
912780,aplumma,2015-04-28 18:54:00,6896,now install a console and go fishing lol.   Art
912782,mike rousseau,2015-04-28 18:55:00,4661,"I could see the water saturation...  The bottom inch or so at the back couple feet of the boat was saturated... That's good enough for me., I left it in  I had to cut some foam for mods and it was bone dry..."
912812,HTHM,2015-04-28 21:35:00,4082,Well done Sir!
912858,Paudash,2015-04-29 01:15:00,273,"very well done, I think someone is going to get a few request for help"
912860,leaf4,2015-04-29 01:21:00,2466,Looking good! Nice job
912875,Old Ironmaker,2015-04-29 02:27:00,8243,"You have done a wonderful job Mike, a very professional finish. It looks like you can have a dance in the boat and still have plenty of room to fish.  Someone mentioned removing the factory foam and leaving it out. I am a firm believer that the foam not only provides floatation it acts as a stiffener for the hull as well as a shock absorber for a stable quieter ride and lessens vibrations that may loosen rivets over time. It can take in many hundreds of pounds of water even with closed cell isostyrene, granted, but given enough time and ample ventilation it will dry out. If time is an issue the foam can be removed and the foam replaced. I would not remove it without replacing it. Removing wet foam is no easy task though."
912891,Freshtrax,2015-04-29 04:12:00,2215,Nice work!
912999,John Bacon,2015-04-30 00:30:00,3277,"looks sharp! well done  with regards to the foam, my boat has taken on a lot water before I installed a float switch on the bilge pump...I'm planning to redo my floors soon, how do you test the foam? I would imagine the surface would appear dry, do you drill to the center to check for moisture? I think pouring foam might be a smarter idea for my boat  You could chip of a piece and see if it floats.  I know I had a piece of foam come loose and end up in the bilge; it sank.  My whole boat sank shortly after that.  I would definitely want some foam or other floatation in there.  Hopefully you never need it.  But if you do, you (and your family) will be glad it it there.  If you are replacing the foam, you could consider adding empty two liter pop bottles with the caps on."
913017,Freshtrax,2015-04-30 02:29:00,2215,For anyone redoing theirs in the futurePool noodles make great  floatations and you can get em at the dollar store!  They can also be cut to shape .

909483,mike rousseau,2015-04-12 00:15:00,4661,Here's day 1 on my boat floor project...  Well I got the floor gutted today...    Then got the wood cut to fit... 5/8 pressure treated...    Just gotta cut holes for the seat bases... Glue the vinyl... Put the vinyl wrapped pieces of floor in the boat... Drill and rivet... And install seat bases...
909484,Smokercrafty,2015-04-12 00:24:00,227,"So you just pulled the old floor, and all that foam was there???  Did you spray that in?...... Looking forward to more pics....."
909488,Freshtrax,2015-04-12 00:35:00,2215,Some pressure treat will eat an aluminum boat.   Not sure which one to watch out for but you may want to look into it.
909490,dave524,2015-04-12 00:38:00,4508,"Some pressure treat will eat an aluminum boat. Not sure which one to watch out for but you may want to look into it.  X2  Google "" aluminum boat pressure treated wood "" I wouldn't take a chance"
909498,Lunkerhunter,2015-04-12 01:03:00,455,I used marine plywood on my last boat. I also put a clear coat or whatever on it too for further protection. I sold it to a buddy and 6 years later it's absolutely perfect
909501,Smokercrafty,2015-04-12 01:10:00,227,"I've also heard that's all overrated. Just paint 3/4 plywood with several coats, and away you go! That, or some wood sealant.  I, in no way am condoning any of these two practices, it's just what I've heard.   But I do echo the comments regarding the pressure treated stuff. Id read a little before finalizing your project."
909502,moxie,2015-04-12 01:12:00,1566,"Coating ply should suffice, save you a buck or two and once dry there should be no chemical reaction issues."
909506,Sinker,2015-04-12 01:30:00,8692,Ive had PT in my boat for years. No issues. Best floor ever.  S.
909508,mike rousseau,2015-04-12 01:37:00,4661,That's the original foam from factory
909509,mike rousseau,2015-04-12 01:41:00,4661,"Well it looks like I have some thinking to do here...  I've been reading up on it cause of you all...  A solution I read is spray ""plasti dip"" on the aluminum stringers and I can coat the bottom of the plywood with it as well...  I wish I would have known before I did the work and cut up over $100 of plywood...  I'll keep reading up I guess and make a decision..."
909510,mike rousseau,2015-04-12 01:42:00,4661,There we go... Lol
909518,irishfield,2015-04-12 02:18:00,26272,"""For years"" is the key part of Sinkers post... which may equal the fact he has the old PT that was done with Arsenic. It didn't react with metals and why all the old deck brackets were simply galvinized. Now with the new PT.. since 2004... you have to use Stainless brackets and special screws or they will quickly deteriorate.  Foam weather strip tape on the stringers Mike to isolate them and the correct ""deck"" screws and it will last the rest of your life. I wouldn't be redoing it..."
909528,mike rousseau,2015-04-12 03:36:00,4661,Thank you sir...
909529,chefboi17,2015-04-12 03:36:00,128,"Spar urethane is what a lot of guys seal floors and transom wood with. A few coats and it should last for years and  Seeing how you already bought and cut the pt plywood, no point in wasting the materials. Well this and the steps irishfield posted regarding specific screws and foam to prevent galvanic corrosion"
909532,Pigeontroller,2015-04-12 03:45:00,2793,"Air flow is good, some kind of bond breaker like 1/8 plastic horseshoe shims will work, keeps the PT and Alum separate...  If you use staples underneath as well as contact cement, get SS ones.  On my floor replacement I picked up two little chrome air vents from the local boat dealer, put one at the from, and one at the back..."
909541,fishindevil,2015-04-12 08:32:00,6254,Looks good mike !!! Yes great idea from pigeon troller about the air vents !!!! And prevent wood rot and keep her dry and air circulating under there as well !!!!  Keep us updated with pics !!! I might want to replace the carpet on the front of my Lund where my front trolling motor seat is and replace it with vinyl with no slip coating !!!!! Cheers ..... Can't wait to get on the water !!!!
909551,Smokercrafty,2015-04-12 10:35:00,227,"Yea, a lot of great tips here already Mike. I wouldn't sweat it with regards to what you have. I built a casting deck last year out of framed 2 X 2's that I gave a quick shot of paint to, prior to carpeting it. Then fastened it with a few 3"" deck screws. My philosophy is this, in 3,4, 5, or even 10 years when, and if it molds or deteriorates, I'll pull the screws, and toss the whole deck out, then start all over.  No stress!  Just GET 'ER DONE and go fishing! That's the important part!"
909552,wormdunker,2015-04-12 10:42:00,1711,"I did a boat floor 10 year ago.  I used regular 3/4"" plywood, but, before installing the plywood I coated the underside with fiibreglass resin.  Mix the resin with the appropriate hardener & roll it on with a paint roller.  The resin will dry to a rock hard finish.  I know cause I spilled some on my workbench & it's still there today.  I sold that boat to a friend & the floor is still in very good condition.  Your job looks good!"
909554,moxie,2015-04-12 11:14:00,1566,"Ya, should have just said ""Great Job Mike"". Can't wait to see the finished product."
909571,aplumma,2015-04-12 13:18:00,6896,well done Mike I wrapped my carpet around my PT boards to keep them off the aluminium 14 years ago and it is doing fine. I also do not put the boat away wet using open decks and a fan just to keep mold and deterioration from happening.   Art
909574,mike rousseau,2015-04-12 13:20:00,4661,"Well considering I've already ordered $35 of aluminium rivets... And the cost of extra materials to ""hopefully"" protect the boat from corroding...  I think I might call it a learning experience and get some regular plywood...  Just frustrating throwing away $100  At least I have a good template to trace... Lol"
909581,Zamboni,2015-04-12 13:53:00,235,"Often the foam is holding a lot of water, 3-4-500 pounds if the old floor was rotted out. Many good threads on that at iboats; even closed cell foam will take on water over time. Get the boat weighed, your better off with no foam than water saturated foam."
909584,mike rousseau,2015-04-12 13:58:00,4661,99% of the foam was bone dry....
909602,Sinker,2015-04-12 14:55:00,8692,"I did my pt floor about 5 yrs ago with the new PT that is supposed to eat aluminum. No issues.   Ive also built hundreds of decks in my life, and never seen a joist hanger rot off either.  Some people worry too much.  If your concerned, paint the underside of the ply, and anywhere it touches BARE aluminum and your good to go.  S."
909603,JoshS,2015-04-12 14:58:00,729,Do some more research before throwing away the PT. Irish's suggestion sounds pretty good and coupled with sealing the wood sounds like it should work well. I sealed my wood with 3 coats of spar urethane and it turned out great. Definitely seal the crap of your wood so you won't have to worry in time.
