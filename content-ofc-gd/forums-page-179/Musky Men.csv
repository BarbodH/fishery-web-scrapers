912624,wkrp,2015-04-27 21:46:00,656,I want to get into some serious musky trolling this season. I already have a abu 6500 and compre 7 foot rod for casting. I am looking at the st croix premier 8 foot rod for trolling . I have been researching line type and it seems that the all around favourite is big game mono in the 50# range with a leader. Please chime in and let me know if I am on the right track. Most of my fishing is done on the French River.

912627,SuperDave,2015-04-27 22:06:00,204,what Lew said.
912634,muskymatt,2015-04-27 22:34:00,2608,And some release tools!
912641,Raf,2015-04-27 23:14:00,3495,"you're going to want a long leader trolling shield water too, especially if you're a shoal grinder.  3-4'. nothing wrong with wire either."
912646,Consigliere,2015-04-27 23:28:00,121,Mono is fine but you will give up some dive depth vs braid. If you plan on bumping bottom I would recommend wire. Spent a lot of time fishing bottom with lots of zebras and they will take out 130lb fluoro no problem. Wire stands up perfect.
912715,ken wasik,2015-04-28 12:00:00,9,"I fish the Magnetawan about 20 mins south of the French. Been fishing there about 5yrs. I use 50lb braid with a 150lb mono leader(18in). Also spent the cash on Kevlar gloves, long needle nose pliers ( 16in ). Love having the musky cradle, makes it super easy to get it in the boat with less stress on fish. will be up there tues to fri all summer."
912716,lew,2015-04-28 12:16:00,12766,"Love having the musky cradle, makes it super easy to get it in the boat with less stress on fish  Cradles are OK with 2 guys in the boat but not so much when your alone."
912730,AKRISONER,2015-04-28 12:57:00,5558,"Can I ask everyone's opinion on a set of bolt cutters.  I know there are plenty of fishing specific ones that run 60 bucks, but is there anything wrong with a set of Kobalt 8 inch bolt cutters?"
912732,lew,2015-04-28 13:03:00,12766,As long as they'll cut through the heaviest hooks your gonna use they'll be just fine.
912742,SuperDave,2015-04-28 14:53:00,204,Knipex are the best imo. I think Lowes sells them.
912752,AKRISONER,2015-04-28 16:14:00,5558,"My question was because for 45 dollars i could buy the fishing specific ones, anyone have any experience with the Kobalt 8 inch bolt cutters? I dont need professional line men pliers, yes they are going to work the best, but if 10 dollar bolt cutters will cut a hook then that is what i will work with"
912764,Raf,2015-04-28 17:14:00,3495,10 dollar cutters wont work unless you get the giant two handed operations which wont work very well when you're alone in the boat. knipex are the best out there.
912770,esoxansteel,2015-04-28 17:59:00,1307,"Kipex the best, apparently DeWalt very nice as well, as for for the 8 foot Glass Premier rod is designed for trolling Stacy at Pro Tackle carries them, 100 pound braid min for trolling esp GB, and 150 to 200 pound floro leaders, I prefer 6 footers"
912784,mike rousseau,2015-04-28 18:57:00,4661,I usually run 2 rods trolling  1 with 100lb braid  1 with 50lb mono big game  If I'm alone running 1 rod I always go with the mono... For me it gets more bites...
912841,solopaddler,2015-04-28 23:47:00,8605, If I'm alone running 1 rod I always go with the mono... For me it gets more bites...  Interesting. Why do you think that is?
912842,mike rousseau,2015-04-28 23:49:00,4661,Makes the baits run higher...
912844,solopaddler,2015-04-28 23:54:00,8605,I knew that. Why do you think you get more bites by yourself with the bait running higher?
912849,mike rousseau,2015-04-29 00:55:00,4661,What I meant was the mono outfishes the braid in my experience when used equally...  So my obvious choice when fishing alone is mono...  I think there's a lot if confidence that helps...  I get more bites running 2 rods
913000,wkrp,2015-04-30 00:33:00,656,"Thanks to all for your input. I have decided on  a st croix premier 8ft rd with a dawai sealine  line counter reel, 100# power pro line . Now what are my options for leaders . This is getting pricey."
913004,Pigeontroller,2015-04-30 01:26:00,2793,"Heavy fluoro is fine most of the time. If you are contacting rock/mussel shells then steel is the only way to go. making your own leaders is very easy, only difficult part is knowing what parts to buy...  130# minimum fluoro, I use 180#."
