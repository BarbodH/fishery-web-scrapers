It all started out like most fishing days do, early in the morning, even before the robins begin to sing. With Coffee in hand and gear in the trunk, off I go down to the fishing hole. The first hour or so gave me nothing for my efforts to show. But nary a wind did stroked my vest as sun the facing hillside did crest. With shades covering my eyes I fished on, hoping every cast would excitement spawn. My reel, its old you know, caught many a fish, both small and large. It was groaning you know, I thought it could use some oil to make it flow. But, it would have to wait as the flowing water called. The hopes of fish were high, no time to check the groaning reel. As the reel groaned on, it became crazy you know, delirious of sorts. It had a screw loose, and off it flew, bail wire and all. So stood I, in my hands a reel who had lost its screw and no way to retrieve the weight and hook way out in the water. So what should I do, to retrieve with the reel I cannot! My fellow fisherman would tangle my line if left in the drink. So quickly I think, hand over hand my line piles up at my feet. My day was done, so I thought. But hick-ups, big and small, has never beat me before. With eagle eyes the search for the reels loose screw and and bail begin. The screw is found its washer too, but the line guide still lays lost in action. The tangled line, in pile did lay, minute upon minute each knot untied, finally after many minutes the line is back on the reel. The finger nail clipper did reel's loose screw tightened. The missing line guide swallowed by the waters edge, lay still missing in action. Casting again for the fish did I, in hopes saint steely was there. Cast one, cast two, on I did cast. Then upon cast a fish did bite, it seems a good one my roe did like. Fish on I cry so others would know. Reel I did to see that great fish, but that fish did fight the drag you know. After some minutes, closer it got, see it we could, each silvery spot. The reel did groan, but worked its best, with no line guide to help with this big test. A fellow fisher comes, net in hand, says with a smile ""your net's too small"", that fish to land. A nice steely hen I did catch. Large she was, the biggest ever did I get. Smiles did grow from ear to ear as I showed off my steely dear. That steely hen did tip the scale that day, 11 lbs and 32 inches, maybe not the biggest but my best to day.    Ven"
