913121,highdrifter,2015-04-30 19:31:00,2534,Nothing and I mean nothing beats Specks from a tube!  Yep.  After that session... It's pretty safe to say that I'm hooked!!
912765,highdrifter,2015-04-28 17:31:00,2534,"Hey gang,  We had it on good authority that our brookie lake would be ice free this past weekend so we got some good pals together, loaded the Jon boats and made the drive north to freedom!!  My canoe is up at my folks place and I wasn't too keen on fishing from the boats so I brought my tube..  Turns out it was a good call.  I went 5 for 5 long lining a mepps #2 (black hackle) tipped with a worm.  I think being stealthy made all the difference..  I was able to keep my bait in the zone all while keeping a low profile..  I was rewarded with some absolutely gorgeous specks!!  My vessel.  The yarest river-going boat there be!!             This one sure was purdy..               One last look...     I went in with the good intention of releasing all my fish..  But the wifey had made me promiss to bring some fish home so I kept the last 2 of the day..  I was thinking that I might do just as good on the Sunday so I wasn't too concerned..  Went back for another round and got ZIP!  Go figure, eh?!  Next year I'm bringing the fly rod..  cheers, HD"
