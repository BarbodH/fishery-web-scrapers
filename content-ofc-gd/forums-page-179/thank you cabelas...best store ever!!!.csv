912209,Gallie,2015-04-24 23:39:00,1215,"So i went to cabelas today and picked up my new 8 foot heavy action st croix musky rod. I was super stoked about it until the bungee snapped on my way home and it flew out of the back of my truck. It landed on the road and was run over by an oncoming car, i was absolutly heartbroken. After retrieving it i called cabelas customer service and told them my story, the lady told me to come see them so i turned around and went back. I was greeted at the door where she looked at the rod and told me to go get a new one, i grabbed a rod, signed a slip and was given the brand new rod free of charge. I was floored i couldnt believe they did that for me i didnt even know what say. Thank you very much to the customer service at cabelas, you have a customer for life!"
912211,grizzlybri,2015-04-24 23:52:00,565,"Wow   that is good to know, if something like that is to happen to anyone else  I bet you secured it better the second time."
912215,SuperDave,2015-04-25 00:11:00,204,Excellent customer service. Kudos to Cabela's.
912224,woodenboater,2015-04-25 00:50:00,2277,"wow, that's service and a customer for life. and fwiw, I wouldn't trust bungees for anything important in the back of a truck. I'd strap it down properly but lessons learned I guess"
912225,irishfield,2015-04-25 00:53:00,26272,"His hand's probably tired and arm frozen from holding it on the side of the truck , out the drivers window, all the way home!  Looks like Cabela's is starting to take note that they need customers to keep the store open!"
912226,Gallie,2015-04-25 00:57:00,1215,"I think thats the longest its taken me to get from innisfil to keswick... I put 2 ratchets straps on it with the tailgate down the second time.  Come to think of it i did get a few ""looks"" on the way."
912227,Terry,2015-04-25 01:04:00,14456,good on them
912228,Freshtrax,2015-04-25 01:09:00,2215,"Nice,   That's like dropping a 24 in the beer store parking lot and getting a new one!"
912231,irishfield,2015-04-25 01:13:00,26272,Been there.. done that Freshtrax...
912234,captpierre,2015-04-25 01:23:00,2521,Can't beat that!
912240,creditmaster,2015-04-25 01:31:00,190,wow never had service like that at cabelas
912277,glen,2015-04-25 05:05:00,2641,Thanks for the great report.  I have had nice luck there too.
912291,woodenboater,2015-04-25 12:43:00,2277,didja hang a red flag off the tip of the rod  I would have cried after seeing my new rod that was run over. woulda balled like a baby I would ha ha
912292,mike rousseau,2015-04-25 12:45:00,4661,AWESOME!!!!
912299,123chadder,2015-04-25 13:43:00,165,"i dont think its cabelas,doesnt st croix have lifetime warranties on their rods? i bought an eyecon from bp a few years ago,the tip broke and it was replaced no questions asked"
912386,Mister G,2015-04-26 11:16:00,1429,"I have always experienced nothing but stellar costumer service from the Big ""C""  Many other retailers could learn a thing or three from Cabela's on how to treat their customers."
912409,wkrp,2015-04-26 15:24:00,656,"I just got back from Cabelas and was looking to buy a reel. I questioned the gentleman at the fishing counter about the availability and he could not be bothered with me. He had no idea of the model and as sumed it was a new product  ( abu garcia c3 6500 ). When I got home and checked  , this reel is available as a free ship to store item. Too bad for cabelas on this sale but I did buy some sweet rib rub and the girl at the cash was great. Rant over and out..."
