848138,Gallie,2014-04-15 23:57:00,1215,"Yeah im starting to get pretty antsy myself, i leave on the 13 of may but i might push it back to the 26. If its not gone by then im a so screwed!"
848152,Targa01,2014-04-16 01:01:00,46,"I was ice fishing on the weekend and the lake I was on had almost a full auger of ice.  But the good news is we had more ice last year and it melted by the second week of May, I'm hoping it melts soon because I am a fishing guide in the area and I might have to cancel some trips if the weather doesn't change"
848155,Gallie,2014-04-16 01:07:00,1215,"I appreciate you posting updates on this thread Targa, every bit helps!"
848262,Gallie,2014-04-16 15:46:00,1215,"Well, i have decided to push my trip back as far as my work will allow. I have taken the 26-30 of may off and will likely leave fri night or sat morning of the 24. Thanks to everyone for posting conditions and for helping me make a hard decision.  I hate the idea of not getting first crack at those ice off gators but its not worth the risk of showing up to a frozen lake. Till then i guess its backyard crappie, holland river suckers, and hopefully soon some big bad carp. Happy trails boys!"
852849,AMilli,2014-05-09 14:06:00,5,Hi everyone. Anyone know how the ice melt is coming along?? We're heading to a spot about 2 hours south of Timmins on May 16th. Getting nervous! Any info would be greatly appreciated!

Any info would be greatly appreciated!  Here's a webcam on Gowganda Lake, looks like the ice will be gone pretty soon.  http://gowgandalakelodge.com/webcam/webcam.html"
852881,AMilli,2014-05-09 17:27:00,5,"Thanks, Mike!"
852953,Targa01,2014-05-10 00:29:00,46,Still ice on the lakes in the timmins area.  If we get nice weather or rain all week there could be a chance the ice melts before the May run
911405,AMilli,2015-04-21 14:06:00,5,Hey everyone. Heading up to Gogama area for pike on May 15th and hoping the ice is going to melt by then. Anyone know how the spring melt is coming along?? Hope it will be off in time!
911410,Lunkerhunter,2015-04-21 14:24:00,455,im headed to horwood lake may 23. any info on horwood lake would be great as well.
912555,Gallie,2015-04-27 14:09:00,1215,"Im starting to wonder about the thaw myself, any updates would be appreciated."
912589,T-Bone,2015-04-27 18:47:00,160,"Here are a couple webcams and weather report for Chapleu area....a little west/southwest of Timmins. Looking like ice is still holding tight, but warmer temps the next several days should change that.  http://www.canadianfishing.com/1-galleries/for-webcam/"
912635,Joeytier,2015-04-27 22:35:00,3990,"Kipawa area lakes are still pretty locked up, likely won't be ready for this weekend (close though), but its going to be an earlier ice out than last year"
912653,AMilli,2015-04-27 23:50:00,5,Thanks for the info guys. Much appreciated. I think it will be gone in time for the long weekend. Cheers!
912661,Tayzak15,2015-04-28 00:26:00,318,"From Timmins, and was just driving around the area this evening. Still ice on the lakes but should be gone by the end of the first week in May."
912663,Gallie,2015-04-28 00:38:00,1215,"Thanks dude, good to know"
841074,Gallie,2014-03-13 21:19:00,1215,"Hey fellas, im leaving for my annual pike trip near the timmins area on may 15. I have never seen ice on the water that late but this year im having some concerns. Do you think ill be cuttin it close? Thanks a lot"
841075,BillM,2014-03-13 21:21:00,17367,"I can't see there being ice up there halfway through May....  But hey, you never know."
841076,Gallie,2014-03-13 21:24:00,1215,I cant either but with only two months to go i start finding things to worry about lol.
841089,Joeytier,2014-03-13 22:10:00,3990,Last year we had ice on my local lakes may 1st and im a couple hours south of timmins.  Very unlikely you'll have any problems by that time though
841092,Gallie,2014-03-13 22:24:00,1215,"Thanks for the reply, all i gotta worry about now is finding some big spring gators!"
841100,mitch seguin,2014-03-13 22:51:00,98,Dana Lake.  Check out the southeastern most bay near the south end boat launch.  Mitch
841110,Gallie,2014-03-14 00:54:00,1215,"Thanks man, but i use timmins as a loosely referenced area. Ill be fishing some backwoods lakes"
841113,irishfield,2014-03-14 01:08:00,26272,Nothing above zero up there right out through March 27th... it's gonna be tight this year!  
841116,Basskicker,2014-03-14 01:10:00,421,"Up here in Manitouwadge, I took my ice hut off on May 8 and there was still over 2 feet of ice and there was still 3 feet of snow in the bush.  I thought I would never get to go snowmobiling in May ever again, but if things don't start to change soon, I'm thinking snowmobiling in May is a real possibility again this year.  We didn't get on the lake last year until May 28!!!  But things can change real fast.  There is 40+ inches of ice, 5-6 feet of snow in the bush and over 10 feet of frost in the ground this year. There are over 70 houses here in town that have had no water due to frozen water lines!!  People who lived here all their lives say that its been the coldest and snowiest year in a long time!!  Cheers  Jason"
841117,Basskicker,2014-03-14 01:13:00,421,"Nothing above zero up there right out through March 27th... it's gonna be tight this year!   That's too funny, I put my extension on the auger last week, if we didn't have all the snow we have, i'd probably need an extension for the extension!!"
841119,irishfield,2014-03-14 01:14:00,26272,"Took that shot about 5 "" before break through.. handles were on the snow when it went through in more than one spot on Lake T ! Was going to go back up for closer (Laker) weekend and have my extension ready. It's been making ice since I left on the 3rd."
841120,BillM,2014-03-14 01:20:00,17367,I hope my fly-in in late May isn't postponed
841129,danc,2014-03-14 02:11:00,4677,This was my preferred boat launch a few days before June first last year. Needless to say that we didn't launch that day. This winter has been 100x colder than last with no end in sight. So I'd be careful with your early season northern adventures plans guys.  
841132,Gallie,2014-03-14 02:51:00,1215,"I havent missed a trip in 10 years, if i cant fish in one spot ill fish another. As long as i have a week of fishing ill be fine! Especially now since my wife is pregnant and fishing might be tougher to come by in the future."
841167,Nipfisher,2014-03-14 04:55:00,2449,"38-40"" of ice here in North Bay. Our frost is 8' down in most areas and deeper under sidewalks/driveways. I would be very surprised if lakes are ice free in the next 65 days (Opening weekend)."
841237,T-Bone,2014-03-14 17:08:00,160,In 1997 we were scheduled to fish Lake Wabatongushi (NE of Wawa) the week of May 24-31 and got shut-out as the lake was still ice covered. That lake is almost exactly same latitude as Timmins...for what it's worth.  Who knows...we may have a really warm spring and the ice is gone by May 1st. That's not what they're calling for though. May be time to figure out a back-up plan.  Good luck...
841346,Gallie,2014-03-15 05:01:00,1215,"Already considering my options, gotta wait and see how the weather goes i guess."
841549,Targa01,2014-03-16 15:00:00,46,I have lived in Timmins all my life and I only have seen ice on the lakes during the May run maybe 2 times. Last year we had more nice and it melted by  May 10th. There could be a possibility of ice this year but I think it will melt by that time
841635,Nipfisher,2014-03-16 21:40:00,2449,"39"" of solid ice ion Callander Bay Lake Nipissing yesterday."
841680,Gallie,2014-03-17 01:12:00,1215,"Thanks for all the replies fellas, ill have to play it by ear for now."
841763,pics,2014-03-17 20:55:00,1268,There were some guys out on Lake erie this past weekend who drilled holes to the auger handles...
841766,lew,2014-03-17 21:12:00,12766,"39"" of solid ice ion Callander Bay Lake Nipissing yesterday.  Last year I spent the 1st week of May on the West Arm of Nipissing and driving across 17 from North Bay it appeared the whole north side of the big lake was still ice covered. It was gone though when I came home a week later."
848070,AMilli,2014-04-15 18:55:00,5,Hey everyone - Any update on the Spring ice melt in the Timmins area? We are heading to the Gogama area on May 16th and just wondering how its looking up there???  Thanks!
848076,Targa01,2014-04-15 19:14:00,46,"It's not looking good, -18 today and end got 2 feet of snow yesterday. Hopefully we get some warmer weather soon"
848095,fishnsled,2014-04-15 20:39:00,3520,"I'm suppose to be about 250km north of Timmins in May and I'm a bit concerned myself.  The very long range forecast is not looking warm enough at all.  Night time temps hovering around the 0 degrees or colder mark right till the end of May. Daytime highs are high single digits for the first two weeks of the month and low double digits for the last half.  Let alone the next couple of weeks of April with highs of low single digits (everyday but a couple) and lows into the minus side. A lot of overcast days as well.  I hope the forecast is wrong (like so often it is) but given the winter we've had, who really knows. Wait and see what happens."
