Tubes, twistertails, lizards, worms...chigger-craws too obviously, but they have to be smoke, pumpkinseed, or something simular.  I was hammering them on smoke coloured power tubes and when I ran out I went to a red and black flecked one.  They just didn't want that thing.  I picked around on the floor of the boat untill I found a discarded smoke coloured tube that was still barely useable.  I tied it back on and went right back to slammin' 'em.  Those weighted Texas-style hooks deserve a mention too.  The wide gap tends to prevent a lot of deep hooked fish.  They've changed the way I fish.  I'm just loving the plastic this year.  I used to be more into cranks and live bait, but the more I use soft baits the more versatile I see that they are."
