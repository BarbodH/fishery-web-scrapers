362359,bubblez,2009-07-15 03:26:00,8,"i live in waterloo so ive been going to a spot near my house every evening since im on summer break with nothing better to do caught a 2 smallmouth last week, then ive gotten nothing past few days and people keep telling me theres tons of carp in the river (im near a spot called the kaufman flats or smthin) anyhow im wondering wuts general setup to fish for carp in the moving river? wanted to give it a shot, and also if theres a time they are more likely to bite?  Thanks alot Bubblez"
362368,Rich,2009-07-15 03:59:00,3927,"Egg sinker, barrel swivel and a long shank baitholder hook, loaded with corn ought to do.  As for best times, I've always found carp fishing best in the evening.  Good luck. Hope we get to see a report.. there are some tanks in there."
362391,Victor,2009-07-15 07:07:00,1609,"What Rich said, just keep it simple. Make sure that you're either holding onto your rod tightly .. or if you let it sit down on a branch, make sure the drag's loose and you're close to it. If you didn't do any of that, your rod will fly into the lake/river in a matter of seconds.... lol...  Try to find the slower water and cast there, it'll be hard to hold bottom where the flow is faster. I have fished the Grand quite alot for carp but only early in the summer ... last week I checked out my usual spot and no carp was to be seen there ... instead I found them holding at a small shallow bay that's literally no flow.  Good luck and let us know how u make out."
362399,brifishrgy,2009-07-15 08:17:00,559,I tried the corn thing in the Grand and didnt have a whole lotta luck .. try using worms off bottom and you should get em .. if not the suckers will keep ya busy
362405,Marko,2009-07-15 10:31:00,854,"Ahhh for some reason i always struggled to catch carp there this year being no different. The only time when i saw people catch some fish there is when they were bottom fishing using worms, they got couple of ok carp. You can try chumming the area you want to fish with a lot of corn the night before and then come back tomorrow and try where you chummed using corn. Like mentioned in Victors post, have your drag lose and stay close to your rod these fish hit hard. Good luck.  i did see ""few"" of them spawning about 6-8 weeks ago, they were splashing up and down that stretch it was quite  a sight to see"
362476,hammercarp,2009-07-15 14:07:00,964,If the spot you are fishing is near your house then it should be no problem for you to bait the area. You can use canned or frozen corn but feed or cattle corn is a lot cheaper. You can get it at a feed store or a place that sells wild bird seed. You have to boil it for an hr or at least soak it for a couple of days. Also wild bird seed is a good bait too. Buy a bag and put some in a pail pour hot water in to cover and let it soak over night. Do not fill the pail more than 1/2 full to start as the stuff will expand when it sucks up water. Throw a bunch out every evening for a while then fish the spot.
362537,Fish4Eyes,2009-07-15 16:41:00,1022,"  What he said. Growing up I fished Bronte alot with my dad near the marina. This one senior would always throw corn into the water and then fish the spot, and sure enough he would catch numerous carp everytime. Pretty sure he was a local, as he was there everytime I went."
362736,bubblez,2009-07-16 01:35:00,8,"went out after lunch for a little bit, kept my drag loose stuck my rod in a rod holder thing and read a book LOL, doing pretty much wut rich said. Checked it periodically, didnt get anything  for bout 2 hours, threw an xrap around for a little bit and went home. Went out again after dinner since rich had suggested evenings, anyhow, didnt have any luck either, although i saw something swimming in the water, looked kinda like a beaver or otter or smthin. Anyone know wut mammals are native to the grand? kinda curious (tried to snap a pic but it kept going underwater whenever i tried and it was gettng dark). Anyhow tossed rest of my corn out as far as i could, ill prolly give it another shot tomorrow at the same spot. One question tho, since there is a bit of a current wont the corn just get carried away? :S Bubblez"
362752,Victor,2009-07-16 01:58:00,1609," Now that's where the trick comes in haha. If you know there's current, throw the corn upstream of where you anticipate your hookbait to land... so when it gets to the bottom, it will be somewhat close to the hookbait.  Have you seen carp at that spot your fishing though? Like I said earlier, the usual spot that I have fished before, has no fish at all this time of the year. If it still doesn't work out after another 2 or 3 trips, you might want to find another spot where you know they'd be there for sure. (whether they want to eat or not would be another thing...)"
362763,bubblez,2009-07-16 02:22:00,8,"lol i was thinking of throwing it upstream but i was like wutever and just tossed it anyhow saw one go by last week lol, havent seen one since, which might be a bad sign XD ill give it another trip or 2 for rest of this week and see what happens"
362768,MJL,2009-07-16 02:28:00,2427," Depending on how fast the current is where you are, it could.  There's a few different approaches to get loose fed (chummed) corn where you want it in flowing water  1.	Figure out the depth of the swim, the speed of the current (factoring in surface and bottom currents),  and the hydrodynamic properties of bait along with its coefficient of friction as it travels through water.  With your findings, develop an algorithm to calculate an approximate trigonometric distance upstream of your intended target…Use the algorithm and bait up at X distance upstream.  Or  2.	Mix your corn into a stiff, well binding method mix…A mix of bread crumbs, brown sugar and various flours will work.  Mix ingredients together, add water to dampen and form baseball sized balls.  Throw the balls of bait into the water...They should sink fairly quickly and remain intact for a few minutes depending on whether you got your mix just right.   After a few minutes on bottom, the balls of bait will break apart exposing the carpy goodness within.  Or  3.	Look for areas of slack water and bait up (Definitely the easiest way to go)"
362774,hammercarp,2009-07-16 02:40:00,964,It was probably a muskrat or a beaver that you saw. A muskrat is maybe a foot and a half long including it's tail and a beaver can be over 3 ft long including it's tail. A muskrats head is about 3 inches and a beaver's 6 to 8 .
363163,bubblez,2009-07-17 01:49:00,8,"didnt catch or see any carp again today afterwards i threw around a senko and caught a really small little smallmouth. As i bringing it outta the water it wiggled a bit and the hook came loose and it fell in a crack between 2 rocks :S. I tried to get it out but then it just flipped around and went deeper down into the crevice. An idea what i coulda done in that situation? Felt kinda bad at letting the fish just die like that. (the rock was too big to move lol) Anyhow smthin interesting happened after 30 minutes. A muskrat (it came right up beside me lolz) came and went into the crevice, do they eat fish?"
363171,CLofchik,2009-07-17 02:10:00,854,"The only time I see carp in moving water is when they're spawning.  I don't know the area you're talking about but there has to be some pools or backwaters somewhere, go try there for the carp."
