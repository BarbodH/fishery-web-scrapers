I have spent a lot of time in bed, hot and cold, exhausted and just an all around bag of horse poop.  Eliminate fishing from 2 weeks of illness?  Hell no.  I've managed to get out quite a bit an nurse myself in the evenings, pop my meds and early to beds haha, the summer's just too short.  Over the past 2 weeks I have done a bit of guiding, some fun fishing, a couple tournaments covering Lake Couchiching, Sparrow and Lake Muskoka.  I'm spending a lot more time on Muskoka this year with multiple tournaments on their way.  I know a lot of the lake, but there are too many unexplored regions that needed some investigation.  I got to it.  In one area, I saw some giant pike so I dug down into my swimbaits to try and pull a 40+ but only big smallies would eat it!  Gotta love it, steel leader and all!  I have had a dissapointing start to the tournament season so far.  Two tournaments and two 5th place finishes, one with 22 boats, the other with just 14.  I had some missed opportunities and made some stupid decisions, but hopefully my luck will change soon, I'll figure them out soon enough.  Enjoy the pics, and questions, feel free to ask.   Repeat clients on Lake Couchiching   Lake Muskoka smalljaw   Swimbait smallie   Kelli with a nice smallie on the dropshot   Another decent Muskoka fish   Kelli giggled this fish into the baot and told me I had to post the pic lol   Muskoka again   Clients with a decent day out on Cooch, lots of eaters for the BBQ   His first bass, released to swim another day   New area on Muskoka   This shore was stacked with 2-3 pounders   Looking oh-so-thrilled with my 5th place finish   Kelli and I doing our first tourney together in a few years, had fun."

361290,steverowbotham,2009-07-12 21:25:00,1800," If paying customers want to take some fish home, they are more than welcome.  A bass in my mouth, however, not in a million years"
361302,misfish,2009-07-12 23:07:00,29133,Interesting.
361305,Jonny,2009-07-12 23:40:00,1380, Why exactly?   Just curious.
361321,ciceri,2009-07-13 00:22:00,535,Nice fishes!!  Is your mother a teacher in Lindsay?
361327,ohhenrygsr,2009-07-13 00:36:00,947,It's Sir Catch-A-lot not Sir Eat-A-Lot lol Good job this year Steve.  I know it will turn around for ya sooner then later see ya on the water
361647,steverowbotham,2009-07-13 19:49:00,1800," Several reasons really.  To start with, I'm not much of a fish eater.  I'll keep my limit of brookies once per season, and I'll usually bring home a dozen perch or so a few times per season, I also really enjoy smoked whitefish.  Bass, I have tried and did not enjoy  I also enjoy catching them so much, I enjoy releasing them even more."
361649,steverowbotham,2009-07-13 19:50:00,1800," nope, i was asked that a lot when I went to college in Lindsay"
361727,Jonny,2009-07-13 22:10:00,1380," Oh, OK. It was the ""not in a million years"" part that caught my attention. It sounded like an actual revulsion (like me with liver!)  Since becoming active on this board, I guess I'm still surprised by the significant number of people who look down on eating bass. The bass I have caught over the years have been every bit as good to eat as pickerel, perch and pike --- though each has mild differences. But I have seldom fished Ontario south of the French."
362570,Leecher,2009-07-15 18:01:00,7832,Great report and pics Steve Got to love it when smallies hit swimbaits like that Great job you guys and thanks for sharing!!! Good luck on your futur tourneys Leechman
363014,ciceri,2009-07-16 18:42:00,535," Yea, theres a Grade 6 teacher at one of the public schools in town named Mrs. Robotham."
