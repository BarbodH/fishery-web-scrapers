These suckers sound like every bird imaginable by day and even make noise at night. At first I  thought some idiot bought some contraption to piss everyone off. Since then I've seen these dark birds with long  tails and white bands on their wings hopping up and down on the hydro poles. Ya, I know it sounds like too many  beers or something from the X files but I'm at my wits end with these things.  I spoke to a friend that knows a bit about birds and he said they could be magpies but I don't think they're  supposed to be in the Lansdown & Bloor area.  Any birders out there before I load up the 22.???  Thanks in advance."

362821,muddler,2009-07-16 11:00:00,623,Good Luck. Here's a link about magpies.  http://www.extension.org/pages/Magpie_Damage_Management  Looks like you've got a problem on your hands.  muddler
363064,4thgen,2009-07-16 20:34:00,157,"Your problem birds are likely Northern Mockingbirds.  They have been becoming more common in the Toronto area recently and more or less fit your description -- especially the singing throughout the night and doing other bird songs. They are one of the best mimics in the bird world -- learn to love them, most will overwinter here.  Magpies are found west of us and don't really occur in Ontario except near the Manitoba border."
