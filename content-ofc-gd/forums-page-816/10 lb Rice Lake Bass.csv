362281,Roy,2009-07-15 00:07:00,13728,"It doesn't much matter how much it weighs. It's a nice bass. It could be that the lodge folks want it to be 10 lbs. It could be that when the dude got home he told his wife and neighbours that he caught a 10lb fish....we don't know, nor do I care. I remember my first muskie. I called it a 42 incher and that thing was probably not 37"". It wasn't like I was lying...I was just so excited over my first muskie. Let the dude be and let him have his 15 minutes."
362462,Rich,2009-07-15 13:16:00,3927,"To embellish and say 7.. maybe 8... MAYBE would be a fish story.  To catch a 4-5lb bass and tell the world it's TEN? That's just a little too much. And I really don't think it's the first bass the guy's ever caught.  Besides, if dude wants to tell a story like that, he better learn some better camera tactics!"

362604,charlesn,2009-07-15 19:51:00,551,I caught one about that size today and the boneless fillets alone weighed 10 lbs...  :angel:
362630,Whitespinnerbait,2009-07-15 21:18:00,2038,5.4 lbs.....
362632,Fishnwire,2009-07-15 21:24:00,983,A lot of people have a funny idea of just how much individual fish weigh.  There are plenty of guys who refuse to believe that 18 inch smallie they caught was an oz less than 5 lbs...or think a 30 inch pike is around 14 lbs.  A good quality digital scale is usually the only thing that prevents some of us from accidental exaggeration.
362660,scuro2,2009-07-15 22:21:00,904,"Okay so the dude is way off on the weight, at least he didn't mistake it for a Muskie!!!"
362689,Dutch,2009-07-15 23:44:00,831, LOL.....  That fish is a max. of 5.  This thread brings back memories of the 6 pound average thread.....ha ha.
362693,MillerPhoto,2009-07-16 00:17:00,147,  He was probly using one of those old hand held spring loaded scale.... and he removed the spring..
362694,Whitespinnerbait,2009-07-16 00:18:00,2038,The Dude in question ....  Should have at least told he Media it was 9lbs14ozs or 10lbs 3ozs  But to say it was exactly 10 POUNDS.....
362697,Bly,2009-07-16 00:23:00,1556,
362703,johnnyb,2009-07-16 00:38:00,3413,"nah...not a 10lb'er...just a reporter who doesn't know any better passing on what he/she thought they heard...    At least the poor guy didn't have the misfortune of being an OFC member and posting it, claiming himself that it's 10 lbs."
362720,Fishing 24/7,2009-07-16 01:11:00,709,nice nickel
362749,Greencoachdog,2009-07-16 01:51:00,8163,Here's the world record Spotted Bass @ 10.27 lbs.    Use your own judgement as to what the Rice Lake Bass weighs.   ... but it ain't no 10 lber.
362993,bucketmouthjohnny,2009-07-16 17:43:00,115,"Charles, we ain't talkin catfish   BTW, how are you?  I hear tons of stories, and i do remember that 6 lb average story The best is a guy in my bass club swears he used to catch 10 - 14 lb buckets many years ago. What can you say to the guy, other than, i hope this day ends soon(as he is my partner for the day), i can't listen to too much bull.... i just say that's nice, good luck, see ya...  BTW, probably 5-6 lbs on this pictured fish in my opinion,  John"
363047,Fisherpete,2009-07-16 19:59:00,1814,"I would guess 6 to 6.5... 7 tops. Hard to guess from a picture, camera angles can really distort the size of a fish. The reasons for any exaggeration are obvious... publicity for the lodge... his pic in the paper... VERY nice bass regardless!  Remember this old saying:  Early to bed Early to rise Fish like hell And make up lies!"
363247,Jonny,2009-07-17 06:42:00,1380, That shirt huts my eyes!
363248,Jonny,2009-07-17 06:48:00,1380,"The guy with the ""ten-pounder"" didn't really do it, but you gotta love how most people hold their fish closer to the camera to make it look bigger. It's gotten so that if someone takes an honest pose their fish looks puny!"
361955,diggyj,2009-07-14 12:43:00,548,Heard a rumour about someone catching a 10 lber in Rice Lake last weekend. He wasn't in the tournament. Just a regular guy. Rumours were confirmed when there was an article and picture in a local paper.  Here is the pic. Anyone know him? What a HAWG!  What do you think it weighs?  Dirk 
361957,bucktail,2009-07-14 12:47:00,1857,Its a nice 5.5 to 6.5 pounder!!
361958,LucG,2009-07-14 12:49:00,779,"It dosent look like 10 lbs from the pic, but what do I know, I've never caught a 10 lbs bass...lol"
361959,Sandbag,2009-07-14 12:50:00,533,Very nice Bass...but nowhere near 10lbs.  Cheers  Craig
361961,diggyj,2009-07-14 12:53:00,548,Camera angle or photo quality?  I caught a 5+ lber OOS on Rice    and it was way smaller than that one.  Dirk
361963,MCTFisher9120,2009-07-14 12:54:00,3761,6lb approx. If it were 10...we would be looking at close to the Canadian Record Largemouth.  Nice bass regardless.
361984,Stoty,2009-07-14 13:41:00,2910," Agreed!  Look at the bass in my Avatar....that's 9.6lbs, and it would eat that fish."
361985,mepps,2009-07-14 13:41:00,1301," Yeah, I've never seen him catch anything!"
361993,steverowbotham,2009-07-14 13:57:00,1800,"that blows my mind that that would be published.  It is definitely a beautiful fish and likely over 6, but 10 pounds?  No sir."
362008,Fang,2009-07-14 14:33:00,1330,"Maybe the guy holding it is 7' 10"" tall  Just taking some rough dimension comparisons looks to be around 22-24"" fish but that fish needs way more girth to be that big  6lber would be a good guess."
362010,Toronto_Angler,2009-07-14 14:48:00,698,I don't think its 10lbs..Probably just media hyperbole.. Nice bass though!
362011,DRIFTER_016,2009-07-14 14:50:00,10439,"Looks very similar in size to this Ontario bass. According to my calculations this bass would need to have a 25 1/2"" girth to be 10 pounds!!!!    Bounty Fishing Tourney"
362018,MillerPhoto,2009-07-14 15:03:00,147,Theres no way that fish is even close to 10lbs!!   Unless he droped 4lbs of lead down its throat!   Here is a pic of a buddy of mine that caught a 5.5lb! Looks about the same size if not bigger then that Ricer 
362050,yo_guy,2009-07-14 16:41:00,111,Definately a nice fish none the less however 5.5lbs max is the most I give it due to it's lack of girth.  If he would of straighten his arms further then it would look more of a 10lber hahahaaa...
362068,Governator,2009-07-14 17:09:00,879,It's not this big:
362114,Paully,2009-07-14 18:34:00,712,"I'd say 5 lbs... unless that guys 400 pounds, then it might be a 10 lb fish.."
362162,Jackie,2009-07-14 20:39:00,124,A 22-lb bass looks like this:  http://sports.espn.go.com/outdoors/bassmas..._Japan_20090702  So I guess 10-lb should look much bigger than the one shown.
362178,Twocoda,2009-07-14 21:11:00,4130,im normally within several ounces of guessing on sight.....if i put it on one finger ill be within one ounce give or take...( salmon is my fortay)  This being a bass ill give him 6 pounds 13 ounces....  How the heck are we ever going to know for sure???? Media isnt one to imbelish the trueth...
362186,icedude,2009-07-14 21:19:00,459,  blows my mind as well that that would be published in a credible? local paper  wonderful fish for sure--no where near 10 pounds-must have been a hoot to play it!  then i never believed the 23 pound Salmon Tourism Minister and Government House leader Monique Smith from Nipissing landed in last Sundays Toronto Sun either  lol  Tight Lines All  Paul
362237,Guest steel'n'esox,2009-07-14 22:31:00,0,"It is a nice largemouth but most importantly the guy is holding the fish the right way, instead of hanging the fish vertical from its jaw, and usually with a bend which seems to be common nowadays"
362251,cram,2009-07-14 22:59:00,1733,5 lbs.
362255,wallyboss,2009-07-14 23:09:00,1095,reminds me of this story http://www.canada.com/ottawacitizen/story....k=19874&p=1  some people should just stay away from the wacky tabaky!!!!!
362256,lovemyprovince,2009-07-14 23:12:00,73,i cought a 6 punder out in killarney and it was similar.  not 10 mabea 5-6
362260,blarg,2009-07-14 23:21:00,289,"Is this picture online somewhere? it looks like someone i know of the same name, but i can't tell from that picture, and he's just the type to exagerate like that."
362267,Terry,2009-07-14 23:34:00,14456,I don't know if it's even 5 lbs who ran the story
