I'd also LOVE to know where to get some backup baits..I bought a few, but am down to one xrap, and one each of the two DT models that were released...Dave, Rapala, re-release on the colour!"
363594,icedude,2009-07-18 03:59:00,459,take the high road Dave--expected that--your laugh is positively infectious--  Patrick Scott--WOW--Worlds Of Wonder   5 minutes in this shift-accessed Mc Master Scholarship data base an hour ago--no Patrick Scott here--maybe that is his on screen name  somebody body has WAY TOO much time on there hands or need the meds tweaked  Tight Lines All  see you in the Fall Orillia
362046,msp,2009-07-14 16:35:00,1336,"Come on people....get with the program. It aint the colour that catches the fish!!!!!  Check out Stike King-Sexy Shad  Or........Lucky Craft-Chartreuse Shad   Oh, I guess that Dave invented those colours too !  You people are so gullable"
362103,LeXXington,2009-07-14 18:17:00,1928,"Your a stand up guy Dave, with this board your get all sort of bashers and tons of great people.  Please keep posting here and tell us whats going on."
362149,hammercarp,2009-07-14 19:48:00,964,"I don't watch many fishing shows but like most anglers I keep an eye on the weather channel. Dave Mercers clips on that channel are all, tips and good information for anglers. His cheerful attitude is a big plus too. It supposed to be fun right?"
362171,lookinforwalleye,2009-07-14 21:03:00,4399,Sure all fishing shows are infomercials and most are highly edited but hey if they were not nobody would watch. The hosts look like walking billboards and their boats are billboards but the advertising works just look at whats in your tackle box and your rod lockers for proof!!  I for one like Dave`s show and for the record Mercer`s magic got me the nice bass in my Limerick report when nothing much else was working.
362235,ohhenrygsr,2009-07-14 22:26:00,947, I think dave bought them all for himself
362244,Handlebarz,2009-07-14 22:43:00,3790,All I can say is there will always be people out there who dont like some one and others who do like them I for one like the show alot and think Dave is funny as hell and it brings you back to having fun YES there are alot of stickers and talk of lures and suppliers but if we did not have these shows to tell us about them or show us how they work then how would be find out about them? I like the idea on how the show is done and hope it stays around for a long time. I went to the Sarnia show and had a blast and will support the show any time I can.  Cheers Dave and dont worry about one person who has 2 post here we love ya and the show thanks for taking the time to talk to us.  Oh yeah about the mercers magic we have never seen them down here in the SW corner of the great Provence and BPS in Ohio has NONE  Cheers Mike   Also some thing we should all remember that just like there will be some who dont like Daves show there will always be the ones who say they Like Charlie.
362289,steelhead hunter,2009-07-15 00:18:00,152,your the man Dave keep up the good work my kids just love the funny fishing guy
362309,Fang,2009-07-15 00:58:00,1330,"I read through some of these threads and could not get my head around some of the negative responses. First off when any of those negative sour pusses get to the point where they can get a national TV show off the ground then step up on your soap box and maybe then you might get 2 seconds of my time.  In my youth I brushed up against the fishing industry and let me say it opened my eyes. I worked my first sportsman show in 1980 and had 6+ years of exposure with Ontario bass tournament series through the 90s and also have had a direct hand in travel and tourism and guiding as well.  Maybe some of the twit repsonders can actually read so I suggest you do that and check out Dave's Bio. I knew about Dave Mercer way before Facts of fishing because his name kept coming up in the bass tournament results. The Facts of Fishing 60 second reel was one of the first dedicated teaching tools - way different from existing Canadian fishing shows.  Wisen up guys, being able to get a Canadian Fishing show off the ground and to get national distribution coverage is amazing. TV Shows exist for only one reason and that is advertising and sponsorship. So get a grip, that's his job to entertain and represent the products that companies pay him to advertsie. That may sound a bit harsh but I'd trade places with him in a second.  Good job Dave and by the way fantastic job on the commercial. I saw some of the first internal copy and you made it an absolute smash hit."

362335,Kerry,2009-07-15 02:05:00,383,"Dave, I kill myself laughing every time I see your show.To me that's MERCER'S MAGIC.Keep up the good work and thanks for showing us products and ideas that help make us all better anglers. Kerry"
362366,Rich,2009-07-15 03:54:00,3927,"If the guy could afford a fishing show without sponsors, I'm sure it would be a half hour of pure facts and entertainment. Unfortunately, sponsors fuel the industry and demand a little promotion for dishing out their cash for guys like Dave's paycheck.  Dave's a good egg. The show is entertaining. His lure colour (like many others) works just fine.  If you don't like what you see, you could always flip channels. I hear Jerry Springer's on channel 12."
362398,brifishrgy,2009-07-15 08:14:00,559,Hey Dave .. you have a great show .. your always gonna get the negativity one way or another .. some people have nothin better to do .. dont change a thing ... well maybe one .. get more of those lures run off so I can get some
362470,Guest gbfisher,2009-07-15 13:30:00,0,Dave. I don't fish for Bass. I don't even watch your show. Don't let the wee ones(critics) get to ya......     oh ya and  ...  Bass are incidental....................    
362471,Headhunter,2009-07-15 13:40:00,5703,"I typically don't have time to watch fishin shows, but if I do, I'll watch Dave. He makes me laugh, he doesn't hide anything and he gets backlashes just like everyone else! Now, admittedly, I'm a SWAG junkie, so when Dave gave Joey a bunch of Tee-shirts for our Quinte GTG, a couple of years ago, he immediately jumped to the front of the line in my mind.  Yah, I'm easily bought! LOL But it shows you the character of the guy. He has not forgotten the grass roots nature of our sport and I commend him for that. Keep up the good work Dave! And more importantly, keep smilin! HH"
362493,The Urban Fisherman,2009-07-15 14:51:00,2050,"Hey guys,  As most of you know I'm one of the Camera Ops. and the editor of THE SHOW.  Judging by the responses here, there's really no need for me to come on and try to explain to everybody what kind of a stand up guy Dave really is.  I met him through OFC, and after working with him on a couple of short projects, he offered me my dream job.  Dave worked LONG and HARD, for many years to get to the point where he's at today.  He did it, and still does it today because he loves the sport of fishing, and sharing it with the world.  If it weren't for that hard work and time that Dave put in, I'd still be working downtown TO scraping by to support my family.  I for one am both thankful that Dave took me on, giving me the opportunity to work in an industry that  I'd never have had to opportunity to work in otherwise, and for the fact that I KNOW the sport of fishing will be taken to a whole new level for my kids to enjoy for years to come.  The only thing I have to say on the matter of faking and editing things, is  A - if it were that simple, I'd be out of a job.  B - Do you realize how much harder my job is trying to fit all the fish, tips, and Dave's ""incidents"" into a half hour show? lol It'd be much simpler, and cheaper to just cut a ""regular"" show.  He wanted to do a show that showed it all, snags, missed fish, back-lashes, hooks in the finger and more, because it happens to everybody....Even the pros.  Anyways,  I'm glad to see that the hard work Dave puts in to everything he does show's through.  His drive to push things to the limit is infectious, and spreads through to the entire crew, who I know appreciate the support we see out there for Dave just as much as he does.  Speaking of which, this post is long enough, I better get back to work on Season 3 of Facts of Fishing THE SHOW.... Because let's face it, unlike most of you slackers, we all know my boss clearly know's when I'm on OFC during the work day! haha  Cheers, Ryan"
362495,Hud,2009-07-15 14:54:00,140,Dave I appreciate your sense of humour in your show.  hands down fishing is supposed to be fun.  too many shows where the host doens't look like they're having fun.  I do have a question about one of your sponsers.  I must not be using their product correctly.  See i eat subway but find myself built more like you than that Jerrod.  Am I eating the sandwich starting from the wrong end? keep laughing Dave!
362517,fisherman7,2009-07-15 15:59:00,325,"Dave's show is one of my favourite shows. I like the cast count and how some days he doesn't catch a lot. Just like me. Of course my favourite show is Mariko's, when she's in a bikini! I don't think I'd like to see Dave in a bikini."
362524,johnnyb,2009-07-15 16:08:00,3413,"It had to be said, and you said it just right, Dave.  Excellent response...way to take the bull[crap] by the horns  Uhhh...Basserone...where the heck are you, bud?  Must be too busy fishing to reply, eh?"
362568,danbouck,2009-07-15 18:00:00,4380,  Very well said!

362742,MCTFisher9120,2009-07-16 01:43:00,3761," Very well said Ryan and I believe every word you said. Things happen for a reason and the camera work that yourself and the FOF team do is outstanding. This show was the first show that I saw with those extreme close up shots and other neat camera shots. Yourself and the other camera guy/guys really have a great view on television and film. I have been watching Dave for a long time now, way back when he started his FOF commercials and not sure how far back it was but I remember that episote he did with Bob Izumi on the small lake in the Kingston area...both guys were fishing out of a small Lund boat and were having a great time.  Dave Mercer, and the FOF team today, thanks for putting on a great show every week and making me actually smile at 9am on a Saturday!  Best Regards, Mike"
362789,rbaquial,2009-07-16 03:18:00,968,  LMAO!!! OH MY GOD!! That was too funny!!
362809,mbac31,2009-07-16 04:32:00,904,Basserone is probally out doin a shore lunch if ya get my drift..............................
362831,basserone,2009-07-16 11:36:00,7,"I can see that I have obviously hit a nerve with my opinion concerning the Mercer show.  First, let me start by saying that I was simply responding to an original post by Patrick Scott who was bashing Cronzie’s show,  Also, I might add that the root admin, posted his comment “Personally, Im a bit tired of the fishing show / cronzie bashing”, oh and that topic is now locked, interesting???   I was simply giving my opinion about Mercer’s fishing show and some of the flaws that I see, it was not intended to create such a stir. From the 3 plus pages of responses Basserone is famous now and it only took 48 hours. lol  Second, I would like to bring your attention to the rules of this board, see below.  It is obvious from the number of responses that it is ok to bash people who are not a sponsor of this board, but when you inflict some sense of reality on one of your own then it becomes a different concern.  The Rules 2.Debate is encouraged, but please follow the basic guidelines of debate. No name calling. Back up your claims with proof. Don't get your knickers in a knot if someone disagrees. KEEP IT CIVIL!  P.S. For those concerned of my whereabouts, yes I have been fishing and it has been great, 25 casts 15 fish, multi freshwater species.  Here is my tip of the day for those concerned of my whereabouts.  The #5 daredevil in Basserone Black is out producing the Mercer Magic 15 – 0.  Good luck fishing and keep a tight line what whatever lure you are using.  The now famous Basserone"
362839,johnnyb,2009-07-16 12:32:00,3413,"That's all well and good, but my Mercer's Magic outproduces my daredevil....so are the daredevil people making their living by lying to people?  Of course you hit a nerve...you pretty much called a well liked and respected member of the community a liar.  Just because YOU can't catch fish with a particular lure.  Take your own advice and don't get your knickers in a knot if someone catches fish on a lure and you don't But you get tons of points for keeping it civil    Welcome aboard, b.o."
361822,Dave Mercer,2009-07-14 00:46:00,148,"Hi Basserone, Welcome to the board!  2 posts on the board and you wanna slam me seems a bit FISHY. Sorry dude I don't jump on this stuff often but easy on your trash talk!  [i]I had a hard time actually watching him, but he was bragging about the Mercer Magic crank bait. I do not have time for people who make a living from misinforming anglers into buying their products that might, and I mean might, have worked on that given day. The technology thay have today can allow them to chop, cut and edit the filming and the viewer has know way of knowing. Mercer might have caught one fish all day for all we know.[/i] First of all I was not bragging I was telling people about a new color that works! I guess when I do a show on a Drop Shot or a show on live minnows and I tell you about that I'm bragging about live minnows?  As far as misinforming anglers and maybe only catching one fish on it that day give your head a shake. That is not what our show is about we are proud to show it like it is. Watch a few more times and I am sure you will see when I don't catch em we show it. All our shows are shot in one day and that is the point what really happens! Last season we showed me loseing a giant aligator gar on a show, get hooked in the butt on a show, try fly fishing for the first time on TV, catch 5 tiny bass and only one over 2 lbs one show, forget my rain suit and get soaked on a show, Oh ya and then there was the time I popped a jig of a rock the line broke and hit my lip almost giving me a fat lip! (Sorry that's from season 3) Now if we use this special technology you are talking about don't you think we would cover all this up!?  Take care and good luck on the water! Oh by the way if you don't think Mercer's Magic works why don't you check back on some of the old threads about it here or ask some of the members here.  Regards, Dave Mercer"
361824,ColdH20guy,2009-07-14 00:52:00,312,"well said Dave! I still love you and your show! lol I did see the gar pike episode as well,lokks like you had  a blast down there... Keep up the great work; second tourney for me coming up in a few weeks! Gotta love your chigger craw recommendation..thanks Rich"

Although i have only seen your show a few times ( or any fishing show for that matter) ...i do find it to be very entertaining ...meaning i love the twisted sence of humour you have ...much like mine.....keep it fun !!!!!!!!  Thanks in advance...  LMAO ...just what ya wanted to do on a Monday night ....write a resume ...!?!?
361831,smally21,2009-07-14 01:01:00,993,i think its great that fishing hosts have to give up all their secrets to the rest of us.  you can brag all you want if it helps me bust a slump.  guys go hard on pro anglers sometimes because lets face it WE WOULD ALL LIKE TO BE PRO ANGLERS.
361832,bassjnkie,2009-07-14 01:05:00,1101,"Show's awesome. The Magic crankbait show is one of my favorites, it in real time. Damn, what show can you watch a pro lose bass, get hung up and show you how to get the bait out . Oh ya, a show without major editing and cutting. Keep it up Mr. Mercer!!"
361833,rbaquial,2009-07-14 01:05:00,968,"No kidding! Caught my 1st PIKE (and probably a PB; for awhile at least) out of LAKE ONTARIO using ""Mercer's Magic"" Like its always been said... ""Don't knock it, until you try it!""....  Awesome Show Dave!!  Wish I could get my hands on MORE of your SIGNATURE LURES!  I'm down to my last ""Steak & Potatoes"" (Yes, I've nicknamed my favorite lure)  I've caught a good amount of fish this year on his Sigature Series Lure....   This one is my PB PIKE (1st one ever caught) in LAKE ONTARIO. PS: Don't knock me for how I'm holding it - My thumb is in the gill-plate... I'm not ""bucketing"" the fish like a Large-Mouth   I also caught this Brownie (also my ""1st"" fish) on an Mercer's Magic   And this....   And finally... "

361840,BillM,2009-07-14 01:25:00,17367,"Dave, it was obvious in your fly fishing episode that there was a stunt double and all kinds of funny camera work.  We all know you're just out there flogging sponser names and not doing any of this for the joy of it, or to help out the general public.  Oh, btw, all that charity work you do? (Dave Mercer’s Casting for a Cure comes to mind....)  complete Bull man, we all know those charities just funnel the $$$$ back into Mr.Mercers bank account      I just don't get some people dude, your tops in my book man!!!

361884,angrypigeon,2009-07-14 02:51:00,31,"i think bassarone has a valid point.  the majority of fishing shows today provide little value to viewers as an educational tool.  most are simply glorified informercials for lures and lodges (many of which are not feasible for viewers to visit).  they are edited (as all shows are) to portray the best material on air.  it is unfortunate that bassarone has chosen to single out a sponsor of this board but this conversation would be more constructive if ppl discussed the opportunities for fishing shows to improve their educational content rather than come to the rescue of a sponsor who has had his feathers ruffled.  enough from dave's fan club - i'd much rather ppl tell him how to improve his show, have him consider the advice, and produce an even better show."
361885,MCTFisher9120,2009-07-14 02:51:00,3761," Agreed and well said Dave,  As for this, i also got to thank Dave for that Chigger Craw shoot.

361904,aniceguy,2009-07-14 03:47:00,1094,"This is a tough one and Im sorta glad I had more then a few beers before I typed this. Cronz was what I considered a good friend until a few months back we had it out and seems we dont talk anymore these days so its tough talkin about him. If he reads this he knows my number and can call anytime, and a night at jakes is always in the mix  He is what he is loud, abnoxious, and well you agree or disagree with him over his thoughts but in the day he did a lot for fishing and lots of the things surrounding conservation today are owed to him.   There might not be a coho program without him, chinook might have even fallen off the wagon without him in the day.  These days though he is over the top and not making friends with his commentary and I understand the issues he has with sponsors due to his own personal demons these days.  Regardless he deserves the respect for things he did in his hay day that still survived to this day.  Josh is a class act all over, looking forward to crackin cans on the big head this year if we can again!!!  Mercer is a new breed and to be blunt is in my opinion going to be the one that brings bass fishing from its current perch today to the masses of the future, he will be the guy to turn bass fishing from the bleachers to the kitchen table, the guy has a hit and like it or not has an audience, he isnt having fireside chats but is actually taking the time to teach the masses on fishing...I""ll go on  limb and say that Mercer will be the Cronzy of today, and will bring bass to the big picture just like Daryl brough salmon and trout to the us in his day..... Only question is can Mercer put them back like good ole Cronz.....  So   Dave lets go put some shots back one night lol"
