362516,duxbware,2009-07-15 15:58:00,102,"Want to give lake Simcoe a try for the first time with the boat. We want to target lakers and white fish. Where is a good spot to put the boat in and where to go from there? I am not asking for your spot, just a general area where to start looking for them. Thanks a bunch.  Todd."
362520,ohhenrygsr,2009-07-15 16:04:00,947,I think it's ORO line 3 will put you off of shanty bay
362575,NAW,2009-07-15 18:12:00,4022,"There's a free launch site at the end of 89 (gilford) that will put out on to cooks.  Just head north east to around Snake/Fox Islands.  Should get something around the islands.  You can also go north from the islands, and head toward long shoal.  It's a good spot in the winter.  The boat launch at 89 is brutal for larger boats thought.  No docks, torn up sand bottom.  Lots a guys get stuck there.  There are a ton of Marinas along the west side of the lake, and most have launches you can use.  Inisfill Beach Park is on that side as well.  As far as boat launches, it all depends on what direction your coming from."
362712,icedude,2009-07-16 00:56:00,459,what side of the Lake are you on?  South Side?
362725,misfish,2009-07-16 01:16:00,29133," Simcoe sides are west or east.Top end north,lower south.LOL Just yanking on ya icedude.   Sent a pm earlier.Hope it helps ya out."

362780,Cudz,2009-07-16 02:50:00,2652,Is there? I use the 9th line in Oro but you need a parking permit.  Good launch though.
363054,misfish,2009-07-16 20:17:00,29133,"The launch at the 2nd line of Oro is very steep. 3rd line is a dead end rd. Becareful.  Lucky bugger you cuz.   Will be down that way this weekend.  I,LL TRY."
363164,icedude,2009-07-17 01:54:00,459,we know you will do fine!  don't think- try- is in your lexicon-but--i do get your humour for whatever it is worth  lol  trust the weather will hold for you  Tight Lines Barrie  www.lake-simcoe.ca
363232,tambo,2009-07-17 05:16:00,85,"be warned, it's 20 bucks or so to launch at innisfil beach park for non-innisfilians tambo really a lack of launches on the west side it seems"
363240,Cudz,2009-07-17 05:53:00,2652,"Hey Brian, What is that launch like?  Is it good?  What about parking?"
363252,misfish,2009-07-17 10:32:00,29133,"It,s the same as the 9th.the launch that is. Parking is limited,but if your early you can get a spot.Most guys park at the top of the ramp,on an anglel."
363281,Bigfisherman,2009-07-17 13:12:00,100, Is it $20 every time or just a one time fee for the season? and how is the launch/parking? I plan to go there this weekend.  Thx
363283,BillM,2009-07-17 13:16:00,17367, Every...........single..............time..  Bring the lube with you.
363285,Bigfisherman,2009-07-17 13:27:00,100,"  Ah man, looks like its 2nd line of Oro @5am then  thx"
363341,tambo,2009-07-17 15:58:00,85,"at innisfil there is a ton of parking, but it gets super busy from what i hear"
363388,cityfisher,2009-07-17 17:22:00,959,id launch in the oro section... only problem with mid summer the whitieys are no longer in huge groups so it makes them tough to find... Downrigging is the way to go for lakers this time of the year
363489,misfish,2009-07-17 21:42:00,29133,"  You will get whites aswell down rigg,n.5/10ft off the bottom,dont besurpised if you get them on a stacker aswell.  1.3 mph. Silver/orange silver fox 5 inch."
363557,misfish,2009-07-18 01:20:00,29133,Get the info you needed? Just wondering.
