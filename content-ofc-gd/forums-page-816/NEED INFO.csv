363261,DMASSE,2009-07-17 11:27:00,420,"HELLO   My brother and I are going on a hike in and around a lake near north west of MACTIER,  Its called FOLGOL LAKE.   Its a lake surrounded by Crown land off HEALEY LAKE RD.   My question is 1) Has anyone ever heard of this lake 2) What kind of fish and fishing can I expect (bass, pics, trout etc etc) 3) Should I bring bear poppers just in case  any help would be appreciated  Dave"
