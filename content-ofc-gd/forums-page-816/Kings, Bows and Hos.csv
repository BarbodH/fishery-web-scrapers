A couple of the footballs really dug in hard, which is always a blast. Be careful out there with your long lines.....just because someone has an expensive boat, doesn't mean that they know what they are doing (or what a planer board is)  Don't miss this action - you can always give one of the charters guys a ring and enjoy this amazing experience!    Iceguy and I, happy as pigs in sh.....     FishingBarry with a nice Ho!    Looking forward to the Salmon Dance and the Tightlines Shootout!!!"

362494,DRIFTER_016,2009-07-15 14:52:00,10439, That's why my buddy and I used to shut off our engines in the middle of their race course when we had a fish on. It always ticked us off when they would set up their race course right off the mouth of the credit during August. I HATE SAILBOATERS!!!!! GRRRRRRRRRRRRR!!!!!!
