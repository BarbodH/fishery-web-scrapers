362600,EvilCooke,2009-07-15 19:30:00,5,"Hello everyone!  Been browsing these boards for awhile now, but have recently seen a couple threads about my hometown the Hammer.  So I thought what better time to join, say hello, and maybe make a few new fishing buddies in the process.  My name is Levi, I'm 26, born and raised in Hamilton, and have a passion for Bass fishing.  If anyone is from the Hamilton area and looking for someone to go bassin with at the harbour or surrounding area, let me know     (ps. no axe murderers )  cheers!"
