So far I've been told the grotto's of Marr Lake and to check out FlowerPot Island?  Any other neat things to check out in and around Tobermory?  Thanks in advance."

There are also some good outfitting companies (sun trail outfitting) that you can rent canoes/kayaks for the day.  Last time I was there, I learned how to surf big waves in a Kayak.  Fun stuff."
