363055,Motorhead,2009-07-16 20:19:00,163,I recently bought a 1978 yamaha 250 enduro motorcycle... The guy I bought it off of is a stand up guy and I know his wife from work so there is no problem with the bike being stolen or anything like that..... What he told me is that his roomate from 10 years ago had this bike and used it as a daily driver.  He ended up getting a job in Peru (where he was from origionally) so packed his clothes and left.... He hasn`t heard from or seen him since. He did tell the guy he could have the bike to do with as he pleased so he just kept it in his garage for the last ten years until he sold it to me... I asked for the owership because I was thinking I could put it back on the road with very little work and it would be a nice toy to rip around the city with... The guy said he`d help me out in any way to get the ownership...  My question is what do I need to do to get this bike put in my name??? I figured I`d ask here because maybe someone went through this in getting a boat ownership???  thanks Doug

363185,steve barrett,2009-07-17 02:30:00,142,Hi Doug Going through the same process .Found a 1972 450 honda mc in a barn. Has not seen the road since 1982 .The beast was a rusty mess but within five min we got her going. The best part was trying to find the owner after all these years.There is no keys and he has lost the ownership. WE  have a signed recept for nothing as he said we can have it for free.Please let us know how you make out in your endevor to get the ownership. thanks steve
