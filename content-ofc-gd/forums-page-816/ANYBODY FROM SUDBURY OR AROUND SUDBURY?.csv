Most of the advise you have given is general and has no bases other than what has been posted here and on other forums. Google is a wonderful tool but give it credit when you use it......

363026,addy79,2009-07-16 19:11:00,573,all his info ive read checks out!  join the game!  STUMP DA KID!
363056,Jonny,2009-07-16 20:22:00,1380," What he said about Halfway Lake, for example, is right on. I've fished there. You might see lots of hooks deep down but you won't get many bites when you see that.  A tornado touchdown did mess up the place pretty bad a few years back.  If he got any more specific, people would be cranking on him for that. Let's assume he knows what he's talking about and has been willing to share. When I was his age, I knew a hell of a lot about what worked and what didn't on a number of lakes and rivers too."
363071,Bob,2009-07-16 21:01:00,370,"Lots of good fish in Dunlop.  I don't fish it myself simply because it gets too much traffic to suit me.  It is one of very few lakes in the area that has walleye and they were stocked many years ago by the local fish and game club.  For sure, don't eat lakers out of Quirke Lake, it's illegal.  Lakers in there are strictly c & r and have been for years now.  For sure don't bother fishing for walleye in Elliot Lake, there are none.  There was some talk some years ago about stocking them there but nothing ever came of it.  I'm sure if anyone took a walleye out of there, it would hit the local papers.  Pike have spread all through the Marshland River system and I don't know that they were accidentally stocked.  Could have been a high water year that allowed them to get over the falls at McCarthy or maybe some eggs were carried in by herons.  Who knows?  Folks have been catching them from this system for 10 or 12 years now."
363117,lovemyprovince,2009-07-16 23:36:00,73, holy smokes are you kidding me... i want to help people out and they still bash me. every thing i have stated is 100% honest self opinion and found out.  i have been fishing all my life and have been going steady for 2 times a week for 4 years now. what do you have against me?
363118,lovemyprovince,2009-07-16 23:37:00,73, what?
363119,lovemyprovince,2009-07-16 23:41:00,73, thnks for backing me up holy smokes some people can be ignorant. i might be only sixteen but how many sixteen year olds do you know who has over 23 000$ in tournament winnings and has a scholarship to mcmasters u?And has a part time job as a macanics assistant(laid off for now:( )
363122,lovemyprovince,2009-07-16 23:45:00,73, forgive my booboo. they where illegally stocked from depot. not ''accidently''
363125,Bob,2009-07-16 23:59:00,370,"Never used to be pike in Depot either.  They were in McCarthy, the next lake down.  Once they got into Depot, they had access right up through the system."
363126,lovemyprovince,2009-07-17 00:03:00,73, wow thats wierd. i alwase thought pike where native to depot... we actualy targeted them on depot. have you ever been to ten mile lake north of dunlop.. i heard it was good fishing for lakers. requires a little portage though.
363133,aplumma,2009-07-17 00:31:00,6896,"  UMMMMM NO  I AM NOT KIDDING YOU  My B.S meter is going off full blast and your previous posts are all geared to jerk people around. You have contradicted yourself so often that when you read your posts in order you can see the pattern of your editing of the world of reality. Your tone of your posts are to stir the board up and I have seen people like you before and have seen them leave many times over the years.My fear is that you will cause a good member who I do want to be around stop posting after he finds out he was suckered into a situation that he feels embarrassed about. I have you in the category of a kid who is bored and is jerking around allot of good people and laughing as the post count grows. 2 times a week for 4 years This is just one example of the Bull I read from you  If you do the math here that is 440 times between the age of 12  and 16 ""No drivers license and both parents work""  and not even counting the down time of the frozen water times.  I think my claims behind my name are more likely than the Crap you are putting out. I am waiting for one of two things to happen either for you to get tired of jacking people and fade away or for the moderators to get to the point where you hang yourself and get locked down. The moderators hands are tied by politics..... mine are not so I can speak my mind and my opinions risking only my good name and my account here which so far has never been in danger.  I will finish with this and say I hope your posts change direction and you can prove me wrong and become a functional contributing non Bulling member of OFC. At the present time I will continue to read your posts and call you on any Bull if I feel you are jerking the chain of one of my friends on OFC. This post should make my position clear and I am not interested in bantering back and forth for your private entertainment. Fell free to P.M. if you want any more clarification.   Art"
363138,Jonny,2009-07-17 00:56:00,1380," Patrick, I mean you no disrespect, but there you've made two statements which you're going to have to support. Both would be quite an accomplishment for a 16 year old, so you can understand that people will be skeptical."
363167,curlrap,2009-07-17 01:58:00,58,"   Do they offer french courses at Mcmaster, because i can't see them giving you a scholarship with that spelling!! A little white lie here and there is ok Patrick, but you are going way overboard with such a statement. At sisteen you are prabably in grade 11, so i don't think you would have received a university scholarship unless you skipped a grade or two."
363197,cram,2009-07-17 02:54:00,1733,Only on the internet do adults have full blown arguments with 16 yr old kids (who aren't their own).  Yikes.

363219,Kellyb,2009-07-17 04:18:00,9,Hey Patrick thanks for sharing so much information with us all.  Have you ever fished Flack Lake before? Hope you don't stop posting because of a couple of jerks. from what I have read most of your posts are right on the money.
363294,cambo,2009-07-17 13:54:00,62," Well how does the saying go,""It takes a community to raise a child"" thanks Dr, Phil,lol  I don't see anything wrong with trying to teach the kid some things about ethics and perhaps telling the truth which clearly he is perhaps blowing some smoke, reminds me of a family member,what i do is divide everything py  3.14 (pie) and then you get somewhere near the truth."
363300,BillM,2009-07-17 14:01:00,17367,"Pft, I owned 3 Ferrari's and had 40k in tournament winnings by the time I was 16..  Did I mentioned I traveled to all those tournaments on my bike?  Pulling the boat was a bugger."
363304,Stoty,2009-07-17 14:14:00,2910,"   HAAAAAAA!!   I'd have to agree with most people on here, and I think that a little embellishment is happening. There's no doubt that you have quite a bit of fishing experience (for a 16 yr old), but c'mon dude....$23,000 and an underage scholarship.  Hey, are you the guy that caught the 10 lb Rice Lake Bass too???"
363312,addy79,2009-07-17 14:30:00,573,"  nothin negative Pat, im impressed by your knowledge base, want to see if anyone can stump you...  jokes..."
362005,lovemyprovince,2009-07-14 14:24:00,73,any lakes all the way to elliot lake to nipissing to bisco al the way down to simcoe.. i fish most of those lakes... any questions or just general talk about this area would be great.
362031,Jonny,2009-07-14 15:56:00,1380,"You certainly have established a wide range of fishing for only 16 y.o. Patrick. But by the time I was 16 I had done a lot of fishing too, only not quite so widespread. My folks were crazy about fishing and camping, and took me everywhere they went.  I liked the honesty in your lead-off post (the very first post you made on this board). I can see why it got locked but it certainly raised a concern that doesn't get talked about much.  One place that intrigues me, because I drive by it often enough between North Bay and Sudbury is the Veuve River. It's a smallish river but looks like it should hold some decent pike and bass, maybe other things too. It looks to be accessible by canoe in many spots, but I never see any boats or canoes on it. Ever fished it or heard anything about it?"
362063,lovemyprovince,2009-07-14 17:02:00,73," in the wide parts of the veuve, there are a crazy amout of muskie and northerns feeding of the walleye. big baits work well. gold baits with a white trailer work exellent,(looks like a walleye). if your looking for bass try crawfish immitations like the chiggercraw. exellent. as for walleye bottom bouncing with a lindy rig& leech is great."
362075,Jonny,2009-07-14 17:25:00,1380,"Thanks for the information, Patrick! Let me quiz you just a little more.  The parts of the Veuve that I'm interested in are the stretches east of Verner and near Warren and Hagar and Markstay. Have you heard anything about those, or maybe fished them? Not specific spots, just a ball-park overview."
362116,lovemyprovince,2009-07-14 18:37:00,73," the veuve goes very thin in some places. you can cast across the river fom shore lol. small pike and nice bass some perch and panfish are common here. i have cought 200 perch in 3 hours (5-13 inches) talk about a shore lunch! i only cept 15 of the bigger ones though. in the wide spots in marksday, very large pike are caught accidently by fishing for muskie. (the color i talked above) up to 25 pounds acutally. for a thin river it is very deep in some places. no worry for shoals, they are well marked and there minimal. fish the shoals on the back side of the currect. get your limit in pike walleye bass perch panfish etc. very popular for muskie too. there are jamm-packed behind the shoals.  good luck  patrick"
362124,Roy,2009-07-14 18:55:00,13728,I don't care what anybody says. A perch every 54 seconds for 3 hours straight is a herculean feat!
362144,Jonny,2009-07-14 19:27:00,1380,"Well that's a lot more than I expected to learn about the Veuve River from anyone.  Not having heard anyone ever talk about the stretches I referred to, I thought info would be pretty hard to get. I'm glad I asked. Thanks, Patrick!  I have a 16' Abitibi canoe and a 2 HP Johnson that are crying to be used on smaller water on days when Nipissing is just too rough for either of my boats. Sounds like the Veuve will be well worth a try."
362243,lovemyprovince,2009-07-14 22:41:00,73, yea it was fun. you might get the odd gamefish like a pike follow em in too.
362316,ctdd2006,2009-07-15 01:11:00,531,....being as I live there....I'd love to hear your Elliot Lake secrets!?
362321,Jonny,2009-07-15 01:25:00,1380, Tips are not necessarily secrets. Just what worked for somebody else and might work for you.  Why the negative tone? Maybe he'll tell some things you wouldn't?
362344,gdelongchamp,2009-07-15 02:30:00,199,What can you tell me about Ramsay Lake in downtown Sudbury? If seems most of the folks head for the west end of the lake.  How about McFarlane Lake also downtown here in Sudbury?  I havent got to these lakes yet as I have been trying the smaller lakes outside of town. I have had good luck in Kelly Lake though. We don't eat those fish though.
362351,lovemyprovince,2009-07-15 03:01:00,73, dunlop lake is a waste of time for lake trout. too small and rare. big bass however.(smallmouth) cought em up to 6 pounds on wacky worm green pumkin from yamomoto.walleye are ok at night in VERY shallow rockey shorelines at south bay. dunlop is alround a bad lake.. to many rock bass and bullhead if u fish live bait.  quirk lake has insane huge laketrout. dont eat them there full of murcury though. there fun to catch.(up to 30 lbs is not uncommon)  elliot lake itself is not bad. lake trout. walleye(dont bother) pike were accidently stocked. there rare but huge. sm bass are abundant.  alot of little speckle trout lakes.. my fav. is flag lake. no bigger than a parking lot it has premuim fishing. pull one in one after another. a canoe or small 12 footer is required cause no launch.  depot has good pike fishing. but unmarked shoals are easy to hit with a fast boat.  for the lakers in these lakes use a green and chrome little cleo or a smaller williams pike will  eat anything. bass like wacky worms n shaky heads. use rapalas dt7 in baby bass color. walleye: you cant beat a lindy rig or jig n leech. speckled: trool with little spoon or small jig with worm. (i had a 4 pound speckie hit a frog once)  have a good one.
362356,lovemyprovince,2009-07-15 03:12:00,73, ramsey has great walleye fishing at dusk when the traffic is low. it is more a sport lake than a fishing lake. pike a rare and hammerhandles. bass are huge and great.(smallie). dont go befor 12 noon.. morning is a waste of time. light finesse work good for bass cause they have moderate pressure. walleye: bottom bouncing with spinner and worm. pike: jerkbait. (white xrap) fish the rocks for the walleye and smallmouth. pike arent to far behind. island are great. i have seen a school of walleye in the middle of the day cruising in 2ft of water on the shaol neer moonlight beach.  mcfalane= garbage. rock bass eat all the eggs. hammerhandle is all your going to get. if your lucky mabea a walleye.  dont eat fish in kelly lake  nepewassi has great walleye lm and sm bass muskie and pike fishing. use same techniques as ramsey as for the musky use a gold buckail with white grub trailer. nepewassi is in estaire. best lake around imo.  good luck and if u need more questions just ask me.
362383,cram,2009-07-15 04:59:00,1733,"Know anything about restoule lake, or stormy just to the north of it?"
362415,BUSTER,2009-07-15 11:23:00,1336,"How about Wahnaptai river at the coniston hydro dam( between wahnapitae and coniston off hwy 17 turn at water treatment plant)  my grandfather worked for ontario hydro at the dam and my dad grew up there, they had about 8 houses , anyway they tell me stories about the big one's but every time i go no luck!  any info?"
362416,Spiel,2009-07-15 11:28:00,9065,"  I disagree, I caught lots of lakers there. It was a few years back and it was my first and only time on the lake but heck, I caught plenty of 2 to 5 pound lakers vertical jigging spoons down deep. Also a few walleye, big walleye and a friend managed to find some brookies, go figure.  Given the chance I'd fish it again."
362483,lovemyprovince,2009-07-15 14:31:00,73, we had a camp on the lake... lake trout are small... must of been a good day.and yes the walleye that are deep are big.  the smallmouth and walleye interfeer .. the smallies eat the trout eggs. brookies are up the river part.
362485,lovemyprovince,2009-07-15 14:34:00,73," great in the spring for walleye pike bass and perch. i use to use slip bobber and a leech.. did well. look for sharp bends in the river. fish the slow current side. if u want to jig use a weedless . rocks are big and snags are crazy. fish on overcast days. they like perch patterns if you use crainkbaits,"
362486,Spiel,2009-07-15 14:39:00,9065,  It was a good week.   The brookies actually came from the lake.
362487,lovemyprovince,2009-07-15 14:40:00,73,  never fished on restoule but i went on the lake to portage to another killer lake. awesome bass fishing.
362489,lovemyprovince,2009-07-15 14:42:00,73,  wow cool. i never cought any brooks in the lake... i never realy fished for them in the lake though. where you guys at south bay?
362498,Spiel,2009-07-15 15:01:00,9065,"We stayed at a camp on the south shore as you head west out of South Bay, the name of the camp escapes me. We fished exclusively from the camp to the extreme west end, never wet a line in South Bay."
362910,lovemyprovince,2009-07-16 14:37:00,73, oh ok cool. never fished much down there. is that where you got your walleye and trout?
362949,addy79,2009-07-16 16:08:00,573,"how bout Halfway lake??  was there for a week n pretty much got skunked assides from what still stands as my biggest northern, well over 40"" and TIK!  marked lots down deep, but no takers"
362970,lovemyprovince,2009-07-16 17:04:00,73," halfway has a high acid content from the smoke stack at inco. The fishing is slow most of the time. like most acied lakes there a few fish but the few are big. use big baits and fish obvious spots. halfway got hit by a tornado a few years back. fish for bass in the blown trees. The fish in deep are trophies and require ALOT of detication to get em'. i remember marking a ton but nothing wroked. downrigging dipsy diving, big splitshots. etc. i got skunked. but the bass are big. i wouldent bother for the deep ones unless the bass arent on the bite or you have patiance like a saint."
