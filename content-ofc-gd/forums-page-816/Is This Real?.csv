362893,cuillerierk,2009-07-16 14:18:00,32,WOW  that thing is huge!!!
362899,John,2009-07-16 14:25:00,2956,"Nice fish indeed. If I saw it correctly, that scale read between 26 and 28 kilo's, 62# max."
362905,BITEME,2009-07-16 14:31:00,1968,nice fish for sure but there is bigger swimming around the discharges at petro refinery in clarkson...seriously
362919,hammercarp,2009-07-16 14:58:00,964,The world record carp is over 90 lbs and was caught in another  lake/pond in France. But it is a load of nonsense to me. They have these large fish in very small bodies of water and they feed them high nutrition baits.  Until someone ( a paying customer) catches it on one of those same baits.The carp live on what the pond owners feed them. These are domestic animals and not wild fish as far as I am concerned.
362935,DRIFTER_016,2009-07-16 15:42:00,10439,"  Back in the 80's I caught one at the four sisters that was 55#, so I believe it."
362943,Fang,2009-07-16 15:55:00,1330,"Carp World magazine is full of pictures of 60lb + fish and exactly as HC says all those fish are from private fishing club ponds. They fatten up the fish and even name them. In a Britain club I read about they have a 70lber in a pond and if a memebr catches it they get their name added to the ""fish"" plaque.  Lots of fishing clubs in europe advertise exact numbers of 40lb, 50lb and plus 50lbers in their ponds"
362946,4thgen,2009-07-16 16:02:00,157," I agree completely.  A friend of mine caught a 55lb carp at the Islands in the late 90s, it made it into the Toronto Star.  I've seen Lake O. carp that have to have been bigger."
362947,MCTFisher9120,2009-07-16 16:03:00,3761," Interesting stuff, can we do that with bass lol."
362951,hammercarp,2009-07-16 16:10:00,964,"I like this world record a lot better.  There should only have been one winner. On the riverbank was Jessica Wanstall, 4ft 10in tall weighing less than six stone (84lb) and something of a tiddler among anglers. In the river was a monster, a near 9ft catfish that hit the scales at a record 13st 8lb (193lb).     But despite its size and whiskery age, the fish was no match for the skills of 11-year-old Jessica who waged a 20-minute battle to land her prize. She now holds the IGFA 's world record for anglers under 16. WTG girl.   Read more: http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-11...0#ixzz0LRGyQVPF"

362978,John,2009-07-16 17:17:00,2956, There's gotta be a business opportunity there somewhere Peter? The Brit carp fishermen would pay well for the chance to hook into a 50# pounder that hasn't been raised in a pond!
362983,Toronto_Angler,2009-07-16 17:22:00,698, I think the ontario record at Preston lake was caught like that I seem to remember someone saying.
