363218,croixed,2009-07-17 04:10:00,14,"I'm in the market for a new spinning reel.  Just wondering what everyone's opinion on them are.  I have read that they are vastly improved over the previous version, and are similar in performance to last years Sustain. Thanks for your input!"
363237,Bondar,2009-07-17 05:48:00,817,"had my stradic 3000Fi now for almost 2 years now and i'm happy with it , i use it in some freezing winter days in the boat for Rainbows and it has never seized up on me , the drag is nice and smooth , the only thing that has ever happened to it was the little clicker on the inside of the spool broke and it wouldnt click anymore so i brought it to the store and they gave me a new spool from the counter , i got the 3000 cause of the higher line cap but its the same size reel body as the 2500 All in all im glad i bought it, its been a good reel"
363241,EC1,2009-07-17 05:54:00,930,"If you are gonna wait for a few months to buy the reel, get the new stradic that is coming out! It has a black body with red as the second colour.  Looks much nicer and supposedly has quite a few improvements inside also."
363322,smally21,2009-07-17 15:10:00,993,"my stradics are great performing, bulletproof reels.  however i have found the sedona is a great reel for the money.  i cant tell which im using half the time.  quite a difference in price as well."
363339,bigreddog,2009-07-17 15:41:00,84,"The new stradic CI4 that was just announced at ICAST is a replacement for the lightweight Magnesium-bodied version of the Stradic, not the standard FI.  It's certainly sharp-looking, but it's going to cost more than the standard FI, which I doubt will go away anytime soon.  I have a few of the Stradic FI's.  Most of them perform well, but one of my 1000-sized reels has a bail that doesn't open or close freely, even after getting some work done on it.  Despite that, I like my 1000-sized reels a lot.  My 2500-sized reels work very well (although the bail arm doesn't seem to work quite as well as the previous FH version, with some occasional stickiness).  It's something I can feel even when I close the bail manually, which is usually the case.  Still, I think overall, I wouldn't have a problem recommending the reel to anybody else who was considering a reel in that price range.  As an aside, LeBaron is currently offering 15% off on all Shimano rods and reels.  I don't know how long the sale is on for (it says 3 days, but not which three), but it was in effect yesterday when I dropped by the store."
