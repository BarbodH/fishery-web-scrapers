363121,irishfield,2009-07-16 23:44:00,26272,"I'd like to THANK everyone for helping the family through this tough time. Some of you have gone above and beyond to help us deal with this huge ""bump in the road"".  As I said earlier I printed out all the Condolences for my Mother, oldest sister and brother and all were very touched by your comments and have each taken a copy home to read and browse thru.  It's also amazing how such solid friendships can be formed on a fishing forum. How many would go to this much trouble for someone they met on the internet?? I just wish he'd start taking pictures of Fern changing and not himself. Dano and Fern drove all the way from the other side of Orangeville to attend the funeral (and to hold my hand). They don't come finer than this. But next time Dan... get changed in the hotel or something. Not in the Smiths Falls Walmart parking lot! LMAO !  (No Dogs were harmed during the taking of this photo.... LMAO!) "

360858,irishfield,2009-07-11 06:27:00,26272,"Thanks everyone for your thoughts!  Long day.. 2 hours of fighting to get into her apartment and 11 hours searching thru boxes/drawers/bags of paperwork. Unfortunately just like me she has every piece of paper, bank statement etc right back to the days we went to University together in Toronto thru '78-81. And I mean every friggin piece of paper and no filing system what so ever.  Gave up waiting on the Coroner to call... 2 1/2 days of calling the Durham Police with them ""promising the Coroner will call.. nothing we can do"". At 4 Pm today Leah grabbed the yellow pages and started calling Hospitals. When she finally found Wendy they were piss ed off that nobody had claimed the body yet. My Mother is beside herself... and I'm damn sure I have an ulcer.  Found a will... main good part of the day.  Bad part... best I can figure from hacking into her hotmail account is her emails are all read on the 23rd of June... not on the 25th. 25th of June Newspaper in her apartment. Dead on the floor for 2 weeks goddamit !  Smile of the day, after 11 hours of searching and loading. Go get her truck in the parking lot.. open the back window to put a few boxes in and moved some coats... looks like she was afraid the liquor store was going on strike at midnight on the 23rd..... a good collection of Rye in the back! Guess she's covered the memorial toast for all of us !  Wayne"
360859,MuskyBill,2009-07-11 06:34:00,311,"Wow Wayne, that's rough. So sorry to hear.  At least you've found a little light through this dark time. Don't s'pose there's any ginger ale in the fridge to go with that rye, is there?  Keep the family close & it'll get better."

I'm sure your sister is looking down at you chuckling herself and hoping you have a drink on her tonight.  Laughter keeps us all going.  I remember as my Grandmother, mother, aunt, sister and I were viewing my grandfather in is coffin all teary eyed, a grasshopper jumped off the floral arrangement onto his face.  It was not expected and we all burst into laughter, and at that point with all our emotions, got hysterical and could not stop laughing.  I'm sure everyone thought we were nuts, but it got us through and we hugged and laughed and cried together.  Be strong!!  Joey"

Everyone, for God's sake, keep in close touch with your family, you don't know what is going to happen, life is too short to do battle with and hold grudges with close family members. I know that life is busy, with 2 young girls at home we don't have a lot of time to see everyone that we would like to but I make a point to pick up the phone and talk to relatives and friends. It only takes a minute to say hi."

I can't imagine what you must be feeling, but you can't blame yourself . . . .    sounds like this lady was VERY independent, and might have resented anyone 'checking up' on her. Perhaps your suggestion of 'keeping in touch regularly' with siblings will spare someone else this terrible ordeal."

We had the police attend her Ajax apartment yesterday afternoon because nobody had heard from her in a while and my wife Leah had a bad hunch and she was, unfortunately, right. Possibly dead on the floor for 6 days, since her Thursday July 2nd paper was still at her apartments hall door..... preliminary = instant cardiac arrest. I had my 83 year old mother at the lake at the time of this news and not something you ever want to have sit your mother down to tell her. We got my Mother on her way home from the lake this morning to start funeral arrangements and we got home around 4PM ourselves and have been waiting for the call from the Coroner all day... (that looks like it's not going to come today) and I'm off tomorrow to go through Wendy's apartment in search of a will, etc. and hope to be able to at least start funeral arrangements tomorrow.  Folks... Call your siblings and just say hello.... OFTEN !  "
