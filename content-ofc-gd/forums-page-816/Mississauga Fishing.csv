358014,hookerdown,2009-07-03 00:36:00,110,Are they fishing by the ramps?
358017,i2edwings,2009-07-03 00:42:00,22,i was fishing by the rocks just by the marina
358035,Dan668,2009-07-03 01:20:00,1120,i tried by the rocks.. nothing . Years back though.
358048,rbaquial,2009-07-03 02:01:00,968,I almost always see Alewife swimming around ALL THE TIME... especially around  PORT CREDIT  area to the EAST parking lot.  I've also seen them around  LAKEFRONT PROMENADE  Park.... to the EAST Marina.
358928,OX!,2009-07-06 13:10:00,6,Plenty o smallmouths near University Toronto Missisauga last time I was there (two weeks ago)!
358931,rbaquial,2009-07-06 13:25:00,968, Where? Erindale Park? or at the very south end of Mississauga Rd?
359854,bigzinc10,2009-07-08 19:42:00,38,"Hey all, I am new to fishing and to this forum. I too am looking for local places to fish in mississauga, brampton. I have heard alot about erindale park and plan to check it out this friday. I have been to the park before, but in relation to the bridge where do you think the best fishing spots are at erindale park?? Also, what lures/ baits are successful for catching bigger game like bass and trout in the credit? Crankbait, spinners, artificial jigs, real worms??  Any help would be much appreciated."
359858,rbaquial,2009-07-08 20:02:00,968," Try using small inline spinner (Mepps)... in size 3 at largest. Bronze/Gold work well... So with one's with a Pink body. Checkout their website: http://www.mepps.com/products/browse/  Also, Float Fishing is a great idea... using worms (even real)...or even some of the Berkley Gulp stuff...."
359996,bigzinc10,2009-07-09 03:10:00,38,"  Ok thanks I will give it a try. I went to canadian tire before checking out this forum and bought these items:  1.Berkley 7cm Frenzy Flicker Shad (http://www.berkley-fishing.com/prod.php?u=FSH7M#zoom-/dimg/f760915efc9b3593c5f63b275f6a106d.jpg)  2. 3/8 Oz Booyah Tandem SpinnerBait Chartreuse (http://www.lurenet.com/productdetail.aspx?id=bybt12617)  3. Berkley 3"" Power Grubs (http://www.berkley-fishing.com/prod.php?p=PURMPG3-NATC+%281007172%29)  Think these are ok for catching bass or trout in the credit river? I am kind of skeptical about the flicker shad and spinner bait. I think they are too big, But I am just a novice, so I dont know. Anyone have any comments?  Thanks"
359998,Rattletrap2,2009-07-09 03:11:00,1652,The big pond visible from the road at Ken Whillans park has trout as well. There is a second pond set back a bit to the South that has Bass.  Good luck!
360011,rbaquial,2009-07-09 03:32:00,968," As far as what I've learned from here.... I've seen/noticed guys catching fish on the following...  MEPPS in SIZE 0, 1, 2, or 3. **Even on the PINK BODIED ones [Not Shown]**   Or this... MEPPS COMET   Or if you prefer to do some ""Float Fishing"", and letting it drift down stream naturally...   If you use the SEARCH TOOL (Upper Right-Hand Corner of Website).... search keywords like ""river"" ""river baits""... something specific to whatever your looking for, You'll be surprised how many results come up. Also, keep in mind... This search engine looks for posts with whatever ""word"" you chose. So, if you chose ""Bass"".... there's gonna be a TONNE of BASS results....but if you put something like ""River Bass""... the search engine will look for posts with both ""River"" and ""Bass"" in its results...Essentially ""narrowing"" the search down a bit."
362441,bigzinc10,2009-07-15 12:37:00,38,"Has anyone been fishing at Ken Whillians or Island Lake in Orangeville, Ontario lately? Never been there, just want to see if its worth the drive to get some bass or trout action."
362662,eze76,2009-07-15 22:29:00,70,has anyone had luck this year on the credit float fishing ?  either Burnamthorpe or Erindale park either or ?
362759,rbaquial,2009-07-16 02:13:00,968, Interesting question!  I'm going to the Credit River tomorrow... I'll let you know.
363107,eze76,2009-07-16 23:09:00,70,"Alrighty , i might be going down tomorrow or sunday , either to the credit or the humber"
363127,rbaquial,2009-07-17 00:12:00,968,Went there today... just baby suckers and small creek chub. (Erindale Park)
357258,i2edwings,2009-06-30 21:02:00,22,"Hello OFC community, i am new to this website but i love fishing, recently me and my friends have been going far to fish for pike and bass and i was just wondering if there are any spots in Mississauga to fish for these types of fish?  Any help would be much appreciated and im happy to be on this website now  Thank You"
357261,rbaquial,2009-06-30 21:17:00,968,Checkout Google Maps... There are tons of places in Sauga to fish!  My fav's are Port Credit and Lakefront Promenade!
357262,i2edwings,2009-06-30 21:20:00,22,are both those spots good for pike and bass?
357264,rbaquial,2009-06-30 21:22:00,968,yup
357265,i2edwings,2009-06-30 21:23:00,22,lakefront promenade is the place where the 4 stacks used to be right?
357266,rbaquial,2009-06-30 21:25:00,968,http://maps.google.ca/maps?f=d&source=...e=UTF8&z=15  That's where it is.
357267,i2edwings,2009-06-30 21:27:00,22,"Thank You, and is that good for shore fishing or out on a boat?"
357268,rbaquial,2009-06-30 21:28:00,968,I've had quite a bit of luck from shore... never tried from a boat. If you do - post a report!
357269,i2edwings,2009-06-30 21:29:00,22,will do
357309,i2edwings,2009-06-30 23:01:00,22,any other recommendations would be much appreciated.  Thank You
357317,hookerdown,2009-06-30 23:32:00,110,"There is a small pond on the west side of highway 10 north of Snellgrove, there are small bass and pike there. good to kill some time if you want numbers.  Sorry I dont remember the name of the park but just there is a bridge for bike riders that crosses hwy 10 just south of the park."
357321,i2edwings,2009-06-30 23:45:00,22,"hmmm where is snellgrove? i've never heard of it before lol, but thanks for the post"
357356,tambo,2009-07-01 01:47:00,85,"snelgrove is the north part of brampton, on highway ten, the pond is on the left side, more into caledon.  there's a little pond by my parents in meadowvale called lake aquitaine.  there was bass, and my dad said he caught small trout there tambo"
357363,i2edwings,2009-07-01 02:01:00,22,thanks alot for the info
357401,charlesn,2009-07-01 03:27:00,551,"I think he's referring to Ken Whillans.  I've driven by it many times (on the way to Island Lake or Euge) but never stopped in.  Heart Lake has bass, or at least it did back when I was a teen and would ride my bike there and fish from shore.  Loafers Lake used to have some largies in it to.  I was a young boy back then when they dug it up and it filled in.  The creek that runs beside it also would have the occasional bass when the spring floods raised the water level way up.  Professor's lake has largies for sure.  Major Oak pond is tiny but has largies, seen a kid catch a 3 lber out of there.  Centennial Pond in Etobicoke has largies in it.  Lake Aquitaine as mentioned has bass.  Various pools of the credit have both species of bass.  Good luck."
357407,i2edwings,2009-07-01 04:30:00,22,thanks for the input
357408,hookerdown,2009-07-01 04:41:00,110,Yea its Ken Williams thanks guys
357460,i2edwings,2009-07-01 14:31:00,22,"Thanks once again for all the input, ill be trying out lakefront promenade in the days to come, i shall post a report of it."
357562,i2edwings,2009-07-01 21:15:00,22,"so i went to the lakefront today but had no luck at all, any specific areas where i should be fishing for the bass and pike?"
357604,rbaquial,2009-07-01 22:54:00,968,If you've gone to Promenade... the marina is a good spot... just be sure to cover lots of water. Tons of fish to be had....
357618,Kenny G,2009-07-01 23:57:00,118,Over near the boat ramp are some weed beds. Also hammer the marina. They are in there. Kenny G.
357674,hookerdown,2009-07-02 02:32:00,110,I didnt think the City of Mississauga allows fishing from shore at the prominade any more.
357843,i2edwings,2009-07-02 17:56:00,22, hmm is this true? does anyone know?
357845,rbaquial,2009-07-02 17:57:00,968,"I've fished a lot of times from shore there - never been bothered once. If that's the case... I don't see any postings about ""No Fishing""..."
357903,charlesn,2009-07-02 20:06:00,551,"There are ""No Fishing"" signs posted on shore in the marina itself, but the rest of the area seems like they would allow it and I've seen people fishing there this year.  Did not see any bass or pike in the marina, just lots of bait.  Charles"
