Here are some of the pics.         Second out was Sonicpike. Shortly after heading out I had a nice musky on but it broke the line. We managed about 20 bass that day between the 2 of us. Most fish were taken using black senkos or small white or black spinner baits.      "

225604,tbayboy,2008-07-10 00:55:00,1497,Nice stuff guys.  Gotta love the bog but is it just me or is black the new chartruese this year?  Everyone seems to be tossing black and doing well - damnit I don't wanna buy all new colours again!
