221089,Gerritt,2008-06-29 20:45:00,6129,"Well our plans have been scrapped for heading to Ivanhoe.. My wifes grandmother has been in ICU for awhile now... and they do not expect she will be coming out (she has contracted C.Difficile while in hospital)... So needless to say heading 12 hours north is off the books.. We were to head up with my Inlaws... and would not go without them.  But it has been decided that since the week is still booked as vacation we will still go albeit closer to home...  That said we have booked with Lakair for the above week.. We will be camping (As my son LOVES it!)  If any other families are interested in a weeks vacation @ Lakair please chime in! Cost to camp is 10.00 a day per adult... While my wife likes to fish, having a 2 year old takes up alot of her time... So she would like to have someone to chat with or go site seeing/shopping with while the boys are out fishing   I have a boat with all the toys, So if you're boatless but still want to bring the family out for a fishing adventure this is you're opportunity!  Just thought I would throw this out there...   G"
221096,ccmtcanada,2008-06-29 21:02:00,7971,"I'm not sure I want to be in a boat with a nasty stain on it Gerritt....LOL.  That's a great offer...wish I could take the time off, or I'd bring Carole and the kids up for sure!  Good luck out there."
221098,Gerritt,2008-06-29 21:09:00,6129,Just had to bring up the stain eh Cliff?? LOL.... now my blood is near boiling again... I have picked up some stuff that should do the trick... this stuff might eat a hole right through the floor! but should do the trick I hope..  Westley's Bleche-Wite  If this does not do it.... nothing will!  G....
