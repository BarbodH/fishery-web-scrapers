225543,Handlebarz,2008-07-09 21:14:00,3790,I was wondering what you are using for line on your reels when using dipsy divers I have just bought some of the #1 divers I also have snubbers will be troling small spoons from them for rainbows on earie. thanks
225575,moosehead,2008-07-09 23:10:00,90,I use 30lb spiderwire stealth or power pro to the dipsey and a 6 foot lenght of 25lb flourocarbon to the lure or worm harness of choice
225703,taper,2008-07-10 11:20:00,611,"Mike, Josh always recommended to me to use 20 lb. mono on my trolling rods for bottom bouncers but as soon as you go to Dipsy's he recommended 50 lb braid. I have had a lot of other guys repeat the same info."
225719,Billy Bob,2008-07-10 12:03:00,5865,30# Power Pro with 6-8 foot 20# fluorocarbon leaders. Snubbers not needed unless you are fishing for King Salmon.  Bob
225739,Uncle Buck,2008-07-10 12:50:00,1000,"erie eyeys/bows you don't need snubbers, as for what lineweight... 30lb, only cause that's what the trolling guide has specs for...  30lb mono/braid/wire...  snubbers aren't required... if you use mono then test your release pressure... you don't want to be reeling in a loaded dipsey..."
225757,silveradosheriff,2008-07-10 13:31:00,1025,30lb steath for Bows - I still prefer to use snubbers (cheap insurance)
