This spot was where I caught lots of fish in 2006, then got skunked last year, and this year have been trying to branch out and find more spots.  So far I have been there twice this year, and caught 1 small bass each time (I usually only go for an hour or so after we put my daughter to bed). Seems to me that the fishing is not as good as it was. I used to be able to catch 2-3 lbers every time in the pond above the dam, but this year have got both my fish below the dam.  I really want to get some hip waders now so that I can get in the river and get to those hard to reach spots.  Can anyone that knows the place I am talking about tell me if there is still decent fishing in there? I have seen some really good looking spots between the lawn bowling club all the way down to the hwy 6 bridge, but still not stellar fishing so far. The smaller waterfall halfway between the dam and the hwy 6 bridge looks like it would really produce some fish.  BTW, sorry for no pics, but I am just getting my old digi setup as a fishing camera. Plus I need to catch something worth taking a pic of!!!"
226104,Marko,2008-07-11 04:45:00,854,"I went fishing at speed river twice this year, didn't even see a fish follow my lure. My friend, who fished speed a lot more was wondering where all the fish have gone. He said he has never had a day where he, at least, didn't see a fish."
226132,Victor,2008-07-11 11:42:00,1609,That's pretty interesting ... where could all the fish be? I've never fished the Speed River myself though.  Maybe all the precipitation we've gotten this year has pushed them up/down-stream to another Dam?
226134,Marko,2008-07-11 11:47:00,854,"WHere i fished there was a bridge, not that familiar with the area as i dont fish it often. I stood on the bridge for good 10 minutes hoping to see at least a sucker swim by and nothing lol. Lot of minnows swimming around so thats a good sign. Maybe fish are sitting in deeper holes"
226143,Jaymerica,2008-07-11 12:21:00,12,"Lots of fish left in the speed, you just need to find the holes. If you have a canoe you can try between Guelph and Cambridge there is lots of deep holes that hold large pike and bass. I have caught 4lbs Bass and 7-8lbs pike. Its not my favorite river to fish but for being so close to home you can't go wrong."
226145,Marko,2008-07-11 12:24:00,854," yea its not my favorite either, I figured as much that you probably need to look for holes and fish will be sitting there. Kinda same with Grand River"
226200,JohnF,2008-07-11 14:20:00,3494," Same thing I'm finding around here. Lots of healthy looking minnows but no smallmouths. As someone else said, they've perhaps just relocated. We're in the process of exploring the areas we'd previously written off as non-productive, just in case.  JF"
226204,Marko,2008-07-11 14:25:00,854, Thought about comming your way on the weekend and what do you know its raining friday morning. It rained all night and all of the morning so river fishing is probably out of question this weekend. How bad is it down your way??  Have u tried fishing for smallmouths using worms when its muddy?? Just wondering if that would work.
226208,JohnF,2008-07-11 14:35:00,3494," We had a hard rain this morning. Dunno if it was enough to muddy up the creek though. I'll head out and have a look later and let you know. if you wanna come down we can go exploring. If we don't see any bass we can check out the carp. If that doesn't work we can head down to the bottom end of Wildwood or back a few miles towards home for you and see if the pike are biting. I've gotta work till midday on Saturday but then I'm clear.  I've tried very realistic looking worms (no scent though) but not real worms. That's about all that's left to try. Before this morning's rain the Thames was getting pretty clear, although silty from the flooding.  JF"
