Left Bridgenorth and ran up to Pigeon Lake Big Island looking for Musky as the conditions were perfect.  Despite the rough surface, heavy winds and cloud cover no luck at three spots.  Headed into Little Bald and Big Bald Lakes.  First swim '08 in Big Bald far north end as the fishing was slow there.  Water temp was an exciting 76F.  Sure woke up after that.  Back to Little Bald for some Bass...skunked.  At this time the wind was really getting bad.  Head back across the top of Pigeon and the waves were two feet.    More fishing in the back channel got some perch nothing thrilling.    The wind seemed to calm down or so I thought...was another rough trip back south across Pigeon.  Hit my Buckhorn Bass spots and hooked in.      Everything I have been catching is in the 13 to 14 inch range.  Heading out again tomorrow afternoon!"
