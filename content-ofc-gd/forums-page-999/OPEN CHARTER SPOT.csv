We had one guy back out and are looking for some one that might be interested in joining in. The charter is out of Erieau. We plan on doing a dinner at a local restaurant after the charter, using some of our fresh caught fish of course. Cost of the charter is $150 for the day and a $10 tip to the captain. Erieau is roughly 1 hour 20 min West of London. I have chartered with this captain before and always have a blast as well as learn a ton about trolling. If any one is interested let me know. Thanks Mike."
