225899,icefisherman,2008-07-10 18:51:00,952,"Started about 5:30am and headed East in 90-105 fow. Did well with 7 for 9. One bow 8 Lbs for the BBQ tonight and everything else was Kings between 20 and 25Lbs. Got most of them on Atomik flies and few on spoons. Suffered major lost of equipment though....  First I've lost my brand new Hawg Wild SD flasher together with my brand new Hawg Wild Atomik Fly...just got them from Pat 10 days ago and have used them for the first time and something HUGE took them all together...must have been close to 30Lbs if not over as it felt much heavier than the 25 Lbs I got later.  Then as this was not enough...I kept loosing the treble hook on the Atomik flies....one on the green crinkle and same thing on the crush white. Found one of the treble inside the King's mouth and the second one from the other fly was never found.  When it was all set and done I've lost about $40-$50 in flies and flasher.  I can see me loosing one fly/hook but two in exact same fashion?!? : Other then the lost equipment it was great day on the water with my son and father. Few pictures from my cell phone are bellow as I forgot my camera. When I got back home I took the flies pictures with the digital camera.            Cheers, Ice Fisherman"
