225666,pokerdemon4,2008-07-10 02:54:00,135,After getting skunked on the weekend I thought I would try my luck again.  Me and two other friends headed out of Guelph at 5:30am.  On the water by 8:30am.  The conditions were perfect. I boated two fish and missed another two.  My bud landed one and lost another monster. All fish were caught before 12:00pm.  It seemed as if when the sun came out the musky shut down.  This is my buddy's 1st.  He was really happy.  The fish he lost started jumping like crazy and spit the lure.  He was ticked.  I was laughing. lol.  Enjoy.

226098,pokerdemon4,2008-07-11 04:03:00,135,It wouldn't be the 1st time I went swimming from your boat.  Maybe you should get some goggles so I can save your lure.
