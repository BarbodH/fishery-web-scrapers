222265,mattyk,2008-07-02 22:28:00,2110,nice tiger terry!
222275,musky66,2008-07-02 22:49:00,273,"Yep, been catching Pike and Tigers for the last few years in Balsam. Swore I would keep any Pike for the table- haven't done it yet though. Wonder if all the people who fish Balsam were to keep all Pike caught if it would make a difference in the population?"
222307,steverowbotham,2008-07-02 23:57:00,1800," There are different strains of musky in Ontario, but as far as species go .... no, unless you include the tiger"
222309,irishfield,2008-07-03 00:02:00,26272, A freak of nature... or are you refering to the fish Terry?  Some nice fish there Pete !
222312,Terry,2008-07-03 00:05:00,14456,"well dang....are you home, or did you get internet way up there on the island and I was talking about the fish...LOL"
222319,Photoz,2008-07-03 00:16:00,792,"Gee . . . .   it would be TERRIBLE if some o' them thar invasive carp got in there . . . .     would likely run ALL the other fish out, eh?"
222332,kickingfrog,2008-07-03 00:32:00,8333,"IMHO. I don't think those first two are tigers, or Terry's. But I wouldn't stake much in two photos for a positive id."
222346,fishindevil,2008-07-03 00:51:00,6254,"Well wherever there are locks between lakes fish can easily travel through !!!! so its really no suprise that it hasnt happened long before now,a very good family freind of ours has had a trailer at balsom lake park,for over 20 yrs and he has caught many small pike there going back along time,like at least over 10yrs. so they are prob going to spread as time goes on,and eventually find there way right through the system they are also making their way up from the bay of quinte as well,and there have been pike caught near campellford as well,and thats very close to rice lake so we better beware !!!!! the M.N.R should be doing some netting or at least some angler surveys and get an idea of how bad the problem really is,or maybe put something in the regulations to report all pike caught in the kawarthas !!!!!!"

225856,canadianboy,2008-07-10 17:19:00,83,i too have caught pike in balsam i have caught one and my uncle has caught one in the past two years i would post a picture but its on my old computer that crashed in a storm a few weeks ago. does the mnr have any regulation are we supposed to report them or keep them and kill them because a musky fisherman told me in buckhorn if you catch a pike you must keep it report it to the mnr and kill it. is it like this in balsam?
226018,ehg,2008-07-11 01:06:00,2666,"Those tiger musky are super fine looking fish, hopefully they are predominant over the pike, the muskies at least seem to be holding on in Balsam so far. Sounds like this has been going on for a bit anyways."
226027,jwl,2008-07-11 01:22:00,1056,"funny how pike cause so much trouble if they get into lakes like the Kawartha chain where there is no ""natural"" pike population so to speak, but yet it's not big trouble in other places like at my camp an hour east of there where they seem to co-exsist just fine"
226051,ehg,2008-07-11 02:20:00,2666,"That is kinda odd that they co-exist there. Any tiger musky ever caught there?  Have read in the past that musky will spawn a little deeper and later in season than pike, on lakes studied where they co-exist. Balsam is deep enough and big enough for muskies to find spawning habitat away from pike if that's the way. Let's hope nature keeps us happy in Kawarthas as well. ehg"
226231,Meegs,2008-07-11 14:58:00,249,Awsome colors and paterns on the fish!      Look like tigers to me!        a couple of real beauties there!
221957,Fisherpete,2008-07-02 00:53:00,1814,"On my June fishing trip (which I will post a report soon), my bud Patrick and I each caught a Muskie on Balsam lake, and if I am not mistaken, both could be tiger muskies?? What do you guys think? Here's the pics. I guess there may be some truth to all the rumours of Pike being in Balsam... not a good thing...  30""  37"" "
221962,Pigeontroller,2008-07-02 00:56:00,2793,"Look like Tigers to me, rounded tail fins are the giveaway I think. Seems weird that there are Tigers being caught almost regularly but no Pike..?  Both beautiful fish, especailly the bigger one!"
221963,BillM,2008-07-02 00:57:00,17367,Look like Tigers to me!
221966,Guest Johnny Bass,2008-07-02 01:02:00,0,I've also caught tiger muskies on balsam. Never caught a pike there.
221977,Jigger,2008-07-02 01:25:00,1237,"They both look like Tigers to me.  The dorsal fin looks weird on the first one. Think there are sailfish in Balsam? Congrats either way man, some guys fish a long time without hooking into one. Second one is real nice!"
221980,Mike the Pike,2008-07-02 01:30:00,3421,Nice lookin stripey fish
221981,joonmoon,2008-07-02 01:30:00,528,"Awesome fish dude, nice work. Hope to get a tiger someday myself. Do they fight like Pike or similar to Skis?"
221990,bucktail,2008-07-02 01:51:00,1857,"Thats not good, they are definatlty tigers. Awesome fish but if they show up its a sign that pike have either got in there thru the Trent system or mor likely they got in thru a bait bucket. Kawartha muskie are a seperate sub species that doesnt do well when pike are introduced. I still would love to catch a tiger."
221996,Pigeontroller,2008-07-02 02:11:00,2793," Actually, there is no sub-species of Muskie. There is one species of Muskie in Ontario, they have just adapted locally to withever enviroment they evolved in."
221997,smbhunter,2008-07-02 02:21:00,186,"100% tigers. What beautiful looking fish.  I have heard of a few odd pike being caught in there the last couple of years, but I also recall years back that Stoney lake had been stocked with some tigers. I'm not sure if they still do it, or if they stocked other kawartha lakes with them as well. In any case they are great looking fish. Good job."
221998,Musky or Specks,2008-07-02 02:24:00,2710,Actually Dr Bernard Lebeau is doing work trying to prove that there is two distinct sub species. Riverine and Lacustrine  Link  http://www.chippewaflowage.com/musky_study.html  I beleive eventually his findings will become an accepted truth.
222018,gone_fishin,2008-07-02 03:24:00,481,one of our members reported a pike catch on balsam last summer...  http://www.ofncommunity.com/forums/index.p...1&hl=balsam  they both look like tigers to me too! could be stocked though... who knows!
222019,Pigeontroller,2008-07-02 03:25:00,2793,"Interesting read, but this study was to conclude in 2001, what were the results of Lebeau's theory?"
222021,jediangler,2008-07-02 03:32:00,1923,Definately Tigers. Maybe the Tigers are eating the pike   . I heard of Tigers being caught on Elephant and Baptiste lakes in recent years as well.
222029,Musky or Specks,2008-07-02 03:50:00,2710,"The Jury is still out. Things move very slow in taxonomis classification circles. Took forever to reclassify steelhead, auroura trout,sunapee trout and walleye. The whole freaking world has to agree before any change will be made. It is still just a hypothesis. But one in which I am a firm believer. Its a good explanation for the size difference between kawartha fish and others as well."
222031,mbac31,2008-07-02 03:50:00,904,I have caught 2 Pike there this year. I saw a guy catch a very large one there on Friday. There has been a few more catched there this year. The 2 I caught were around 6-7 lbs. I have caught Tigers in there before as well. Most of the pike have come from the Mouth of the trent on Mitchell side.
222033,gone_fishin,2008-07-02 03:56:00,481, that can't be good for the kawarthas as a whole! i hope they don't take over the muskie fishery like they did in Dalrymple... not very many muskies in there anymore!
222034,Pigeontroller,2008-07-02 03:57:00,2793," I definately agree there are different genetics involved, but that doesn't nessarilly make them different species...  Either way, I like the fat ones!"
222035,mbac31,2008-07-02 03:58:00,904,Balsam will be ruined for sure. Such a clear lake the Pike will thrive there very easily. I would give it a couple of years for sure then it will be over run by Pike for sure.
222040,gone_fishin,2008-07-02 04:17:00,481,"if balsam gets over-run by pike, it won't be long before the other kawarthas follow suit, unfortunately... Like i said before, Dalrymple is a perfect example, there are still a few muskies left (and they are BIG), but there are just too many pike to contend with... i REALLY hope the other kawartha lakes don't follow the same pattern."
222093,BillM,2008-07-02 12:34:00,17367,So any pike caught on Balsam should be kept for dinner?
222099,mattyk,2008-07-02 13:06:00,2110,those are tiger muskies.  Here is a picture of a pike that i caught in balsam last year. The MNR needs to to something about this pike invasion before it spreads. Soon Balsam will be like Canal and Darymple over run with dinky pike.  
222106,Reef Runner,2008-07-02 13:34:00,980,"Tiger 100%.  Beautiful looking fish.  It is true that Pike have over ran Darlymple and Canal Lakes, at the detrement of the musky fisheries there.  They are in there, however, all that I've caught were tigers but they are extremely difficult to hunt.  There are signs posted at the Kirkfield lift lock not to bring over pike into Mitchell and Balsam and I beleive the operator on the liftlock has directions to check the tanks if any got through.  Further, the MNR pulls nets through Balsam every couple years to check on pike populations.  It is ineveitable that they will find their way into the lake, but programs are in place to slow the proliferation amongst anglers."
222234,Ron,2008-07-02 20:22:00,1683,"Coloration and rounded fins are just a few of many factors to make a Tiger or ""Hybrid""  Here is a poster to help you identify your fish a little clearer, hope it helps.  "
