226154,kickingfrog,2008-07-11 12:50:00,8333,"Moving water is SO powerful, that boat looked like it was a toy. That guy was almost a candidate for a Darwin award."
226155,The Urban Fisherman,2008-07-11 12:51:00,2050,see after that I think i'll stick to fishing the lower niagara! lol  cool vid cliff
226156,steve_paul,2008-07-11 12:52:00,658,"Holy crap.  Good video Cliff, glad they both survived."
226158,Joey,2008-07-11 13:01:00,9122,"OMG, that is the scariest thing I've seen in awhile.  Lower Niagara it is  Thanks for sharing that Cliff.  And Glen, you be careful  Joey"
226163,Greencoachdog,2008-07-11 13:12:00,8163,"That boat was sucked thru the open flood gate!... and that guy was an idiot for getting anywhere near the dam when those things are open!!!  I won't even launch if they have any flood gates open at all, there's a BIG difference between hydrogeneration and open flood gates!!!... and you have to be careful with just generation too, if they have more than 2 turbines running... I won't fish it!!!  We have a phone# we call that gives us a generation schedule and how many units will be running, I'll also make a pass by the dam to have a ""look see"" before I decide if it's safe or not.  I aint riskin' my   for a few fish!!!"
226191,BITEME,2008-07-11 14:01:00,1969,Lottery Tickets!!!!!!!
226212,Greencoachdog,2008-07-11 14:42:00,8163,"  This is a pic of water entering the dam for hydrogeneration. The black structure is a heavy steel grating that prevents objects larger than 6"" in diameter from being sucked into the turbines and ruining them. Fish hold behind the grating for an excellent ambush point and dart out and grab Shad as they are swept by or thru the grating.    This is a pic of water exiting the dam after being drawn thru the turbines. (right side of pic)  The flood gates are the structures with the steel arms on the left side of the pic (closed position). The flood gates are only opened during times of extreme flooding (usually in early spring).  The water will be extremely high (duh!) and muddy with very fast/strong current and massive amounts of debris... not condusive to good fishing.  It's better to stay home and sharpen hooks during those times!"
226214,fishnsled,2008-07-11 14:43:00,3520,That's just craziness.  Glad everyone is fine.  You're right Peter - lottery tickets for sure!
226244,Zubris21,2008-07-11 15:17:00,563,That is very scary!!
226284,jdmls,2008-07-11 16:54:00,575,Wow....That's scarry...Bet you that guy won't be fishing from a boat anytime soon
226285,Pachone,2008-07-11 17:03:00,276,YIKES!
226323,ehg,2008-07-11 18:14:00,2666,"That video is a pretty good fake re- enactment. If it even really happened, but"
226332,Greencoachdog,2008-07-11 18:24:00,8163,"  It did looka a little fake to me, but I think it's the real thing.  Unfortunately it does happen, and has happened down here. It was a miracle those two survived, out of the number of times it's happened here... noone has survived to my knowledge."
