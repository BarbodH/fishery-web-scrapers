226171,Squid,2008-07-11 13:37:00,1656,"  Cliffs balls finally made into my hands. They were all scratched and dirty but after a good wash, Cliff's balls came out nice and clean. Bite Me et al, thanks so much for watching and carrying Cliff's balls around until I was able to get them into my hands. Oh and heavy to boot.  Squid "
226174,Reef Runner,2008-07-11 13:41:00,980,I hope y'all washed your hands after
226178,Greencoachdog,2008-07-11 13:44:00,8163,So there were 2 Peters with Big Cliffs balls?
226183,BITEME,2008-07-11 13:55:00,1969,Balls that big require 2 Peters
226186,John,2008-07-11 13:56:00,2956,Just how big are they..............?
226189,Roy,2008-07-11 14:00:00,13728," Yeah, we're having popcorn."
226192,JohnF,2008-07-11 14:02:00,3494,One wonders if Big Cliff's feeling the loss of his balls yet?  JF
226205,Joey,2008-07-11 14:25:00,9122,Could I get a picture of Peter with the Balls?  Joey
226234,maybe,2008-07-11 15:03:00,307,"Giving the shirt off your back is one thing, but Big Cliff's really taken it to a whole 'nother level."
226238,ccmtcanada,2008-07-11 15:08:00,7971,I dont want to see anyones balls that have been manhandled that many times by different people.  Actually...I don't wanna see anyones else's balls.....
226240,fishnsled,2008-07-11 15:10:00,3520, Ditto -
226315,Handlebarz,2008-07-11 18:05:00,3790,  Did you want them in full size or shrunk down?
226316,JohnF,2008-07-11 18:06:00,3494, Mebbe she'd like to see 'em in action.  JF
226321,steve_paul,2008-07-11 18:10:00,658," Cliff, will Big Cliff's balls make the remix release of the OFC Anthem??"
226339,ccmtcanada,2008-07-11 18:46:00,7971," Hmmm....will have to think that one over....LOL.  Maybe I'll have to do another song...to the tune of AC/DCs ""Big Balls"" and work it in that way."
226340,SlowPoke,2008-07-11 18:51:00,2984,"He's married, they haven't been used in years."
226343,Squid,2008-07-11 18:57:00,1656, 
226346,misfish,2008-07-11 18:58:00,29133,  ROTFLMAO. Aint it the truth.
226395,JohnF,2008-07-11 20:04:00,3494," Hey. I've heard guys refer to the old ball and chain, but using her for a downrigger - sheesh!  JF"
226458,Rich,2008-07-11 21:45:00,3927,"  Wait a minute, if he's married, how'd Squid get them out of the vice?"
226459,Big Cliff,2008-07-11 21:50:00,6899,"You guys are just too funny  Glad to hear that they finally got to where they are going and will finally see some action again, it has been a while! Joey I'm sure squid will show them to you in person (or replicas) you don't need a picture."
226466,ChrisK,2008-07-11 22:03:00,2772,Must be a catchy thing cause this band even wrote a song about them  
226486,JohnF,2008-07-11 22:37:00,3494, I hope he at least cleans them off before he shows them to anyone. It's not yer fault any more if they're all rusty.  JF
