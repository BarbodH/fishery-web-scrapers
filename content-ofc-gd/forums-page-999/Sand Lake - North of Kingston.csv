223976,Stoty,2008-07-06 23:42:00,2910,"My buddy and I are heading to Sand Lake for our Annual Fishing trip on Thursday. Just wanted to see if anyone knew what the bite was like for bass/walleye/pike?  Any help is much appreciated!  Cheers, *Stoty"
224247,Stoty,2008-07-07 11:51:00,2910,Anyone...?
224250,Greencoachdog,2008-07-07 11:56:00,8163,"I haven't ever fished it, but I'd be more than happy to help you fish it if you'd swing by and pick me up on the way!"
224440,Stoty,2008-07-07 18:26:00,2910,"Ha ha ha, I wish I could afford the gas to do so! $1.36/L today. INSANE!"
224473,cranks bait,2008-07-07 19:31:00,721,"Gas is usually cheapest in Kingston, around this part of the world anyways.  As for the lake.  I have barely heard of it, but know nothing about it.  The fishing has been great in this area, I'm guessing it could be the same there.  Although it does change hourly here, gets frustrating sometimes."
224522,Stoty,2008-07-07 21:09:00,2910,"Thanks Scott. I have been to the lake before, but it was back in 2004. Caught some really nice Smallmouth, so I am hoping this year will be some of the same! If you will be around the area, you should come fishing for the day! Bring a boat and a buddy and we could have a mini-tournament or something!"
224524,cranks bait,2008-07-07 21:15:00,721,Oh man I wish I could.  Unfortunately I'll be up in Carlton Place at a race this weekend.  Other wise I would be there.  Have a great time.
225435,Stoty,2008-07-09 16:26:00,2910,One last shot....anyone have an reports on Sand Lake? My buddy and I are heading out first thing tomorrow morning until Sunday. Lets hope we get enough for a nice report!
225450,Rich,2008-07-09 16:58:00,3927,"My buddy owns a lodge on that lake. He was saying a couple days ago that the smallies are hitting great, pike are slowing down, and walleye fishing has been slow all year."
225519,Stoty,2008-07-09 19:46:00,2910,"Nice, thanks Rich.  Which lodge does he/she own?"
225982,RsX,2008-07-10 23:29:00,48,if sand lake is not producing there is a whole bunch of lakes up there
226054,njm,2008-07-11 02:22:00,20,"Is that the Sand lake in Plevna? If it is, fishing is not bad. Pickeral and Bass is what i catch up there. it is also connected , via a small stream, to another lake,,,which is also good.  Neil"
