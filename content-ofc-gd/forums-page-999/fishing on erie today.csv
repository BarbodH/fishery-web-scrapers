That was awesome of jeff to invite us out for the day,hey I just remebered that he said today was the first fishin mission for the Reel Serious this season,guess we broke the boat in pretty good.  man what a big average for the fish today too..even the smaller fish where couple lbers, the other ones just make them look small  .  Thanks for sharing the pics man, to bad I had to take my fish and run so quick when we got back to the dock, wasn't trying to ditch everyone so quick, I just had to go..good thing I stuck around for a couple pics.  hats off to Jeff for treating us to a great day out on his boat, man was i glad when I got the invite to go out with you guys.  We made the best of the day as usual, great way to spend the day with some great fishin buddies and go kick some butt out there on the water, man can you imagine if I didn't have to go, how many fish we could have brought in from that majic spot if we had some more time out there."
