225420,Roy,2008-07-09 14:58:00,13728,"The short answer is yes, a 17 gal. livewell is large enough for a bass tourney. Remember though that your livewell is never full, it's usually half full. That makes it an 8.5 gal. livewell. If you're planning on fishing for other species, particularly esox, you'll need a long livewell.  Fishing tourneys is about the only reason anyone could need a livewell. I've disconnected mine and now use it for storing baits. I don't often keep fish so they get released right away. If I choose to keep some, the best method is to quickly dispatch them and put them on ice."

225676,BabyHerc,2008-07-10 03:45:00,285,A good oxygenator is more important than livewell size I would think.  And a smaller livewell would be easier to control the level of oxygen and water temp to ensure a stress-free trip to the weigh-in for the bass.
