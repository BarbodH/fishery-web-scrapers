225613,vanillagorilla,2008-07-10 01:08:00,46,The fishing this year has been incredible on the North Shore!!!  Bluffers did not disappoint.  First lines were down at 8:00am with a dense fog wrapped around us.  We hit this first fish in the mid teens at 8:30am on an APEX 4.0.  These lures have not performed well for me for the past couple of years but my buddy had a hunch to give them a try this year and they have been extremely productive.    The wire was the most consistent setup today with 6 of the 10 hits.  We got this 25 pound plus fish on the wire with meat.  I can tell you one thing there is no bait better on the lake at this time of year than fresh herring cut bait.    All in all it was a great day on the water.  We ended up going 8 for 10 with the fish ranging from mid teens to mid twenties.  We headed in at noon and got the last fish as we were packing it up.  This is probably the best year we have experienced in a long time on the North Shore so get out there and hook yourself a monster KING!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
