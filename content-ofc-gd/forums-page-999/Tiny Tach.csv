226003,Daplumma,2008-07-11 00:08:00,1961,A few people at Lakair were asking about an hour meter/Tachometer for their boat motors.I have been using Tiny Tachs since 1990 or so on my Jet Ski motors as well as my boat motors.Very cheap and reliable.They will custom make the length of the leads for your boat and install in minutes.I have no connection with this company or interest other than I have used their products and they really work. http://www.tinytach.com/tinytach/index.php Joe
