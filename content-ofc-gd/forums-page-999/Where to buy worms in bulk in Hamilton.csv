225918,cranks bait,2008-07-10 19:38:00,721,"I don't know of where to get them in Hamilton.  Although I do buy them in 100's at a time for $30.00 from our local outfitters.  They also happen to be the worms I have the best luck with.  Not sure of the name, Saltys or something like that."

225974,addict,2008-07-10 23:09:00,475,"wait for the dew to come out in the evening get a flashlight and pick em.a few yrs ago i was going for channel cats and i picked about 200 worms in about an hour.look on your lawn(or your neighbors if his grass is cut shorter,makes for easier picking)or in the garden."
225979,xrap,2008-07-10 23:24:00,683,"Fishing world sucks!! If your looking for a bait shop there is one on upper james called Bills Bait and Tackle, Phone number 905-388-5873 and the address is 534 Upper James St. Your best bet would be to pick them yourself after a good rainfall, good luck."

226071,Hooked,2008-07-11 02:43:00,891,"  I agree with everything xrap mentioned.  Couple weeks ago after a rain, I caught around 2 dozen in 10 minutes, just to give you an idea how easy it is, and cheap."
226082,Gerritt,2008-07-11 03:05:00,6129,Cannot say I disagree with either xrap or hooked. I will no longer deal with them either.  pick em yourself! if you do not get rain SOAK the lawn with the sprinkler.  G
226135,Victor,2008-07-11 11:52:00,1609,"I started picking worms for my fishing trips myself this year as well. After a rain storm they're everywhere and you can probably get 3-4 dozen easily. Good thing is, saves you money, saves you time to visit the tackle shop and it's more fun to catch fish on your ""own"" worms i guess lol."
226225,jeff24,2008-07-11 14:54:00,35,"I agree about forgetting Fishing World. Bills Bait Upper James is a must, Greg or Tim will treat you like a king! 905 388 5873, This is not and ad. They just treat me great every time regardless of my reciept total."
