225593,lunkerbasshunter,2008-07-10 00:46:00,2585,a report now will most likely cahnge come august when you go up.  it may be better to call a local bait shop a week before you go up.  When i go to new fishing areas i always drop 20-30 bucks at a local bait store and they always give me tips on whats biting and whats working.  Cheers!

Walleye tend to move ...I will be able to give you a concrete answer in a month or so,  Where are you gonna stay?...fishing from which Lodge?     Randy"
