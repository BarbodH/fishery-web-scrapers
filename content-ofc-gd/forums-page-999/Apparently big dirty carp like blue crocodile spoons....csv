225601,gone_fishin,2008-07-10 00:52:00,481,"my very first and biggest carp to date was caught on an original floating rapala in the perch pattern... it was hooked in the mouth... the fish was in the 40LB range too...    i realize now i shouldn't have been holding the fish by the gills, but i was young at the time and didn't know any better... the fish did swim away just fine though..."
