I put an extra bait in there ( it is one of my favorites) anyone who has fished with me will know what it is.. let me know when you get it and please keep the legend known as D.S.I to yourself...  Good luck with the baits and if you are ever in Eastern Ontario I would love tog et you on the water,. I will have my new boat in the spring.  Sorry again for the delay"
