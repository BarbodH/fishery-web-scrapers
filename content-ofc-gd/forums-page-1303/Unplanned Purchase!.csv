11510,pikehunter,2006-12-13 01:39:00,1659," Nice boat Roger, you have to love   employee discounts! And what a way to use it, on a large purchase!"

11525,fishdawg,2006-12-13 01:57:00,912,congrats Roger!  now budget for some riggers & planerboards for them salmon!
11532,Garyv,2006-12-13 02:11:00,547,Nice boat at a very attractive price!
11536,mepps,2006-12-13 02:20:00,1301,"Great purchase, im sure you wil get many wonderful years from it!"
11547,moosehead,2006-12-13 02:41:00,90,"Nice boat Roger! Looks like we will both have new boats to start the toonie series as i recently closed the deal on a Legend V 151 viper, my first boat with a steering wheel Looking forward to the spring."
11581,bpsbassman,2006-12-13 04:12:00,941,"Already got 'em fishdawg.  Just gotta figure out how to use 'em now.  That's awesome news Ken!!  I know how long you've been looking.  If you can finish 2nd overall with your old 14 ft tiller, then you should be able to give 'er a good run for the title next year. You should join me and Wayne in Christening our boats at Lakair next June!"
11584,Ron,2006-12-13 04:44:00,1683,"Very nice rig Roger,  I'll be sure to ask all the new boat owners what their most anticipated ""Things to do in the Spring list"" around Mid February. Just so you guys can get antsy on gearing up the boats for the season. The agony that will go with this reminder will be cruel and painful to say the least.  Well, some of us will find it funny! I am sure you will be getting a lot of years great use out of it, good on ya bud."
11587,irishfield,2006-12-13 04:52:00,26272,Gee..that's so nice Ronnie. As if the suspense isnt' bad enough. Did I tell you yet that your reservation was cancelled?
11590,Ron,2006-12-13 05:03:00,1683,Anything I can do to help out Wayne.  What trip???
11605,Mike the Pike,2006-12-13 06:05:00,3421,Deals are all about being at the right place at the right time.Same with fishing.
11640,bpsbassman,2006-12-13 13:01:00,941,"Hey Wayne, is this Ron guy    a friend of yours??  I remember a kinder and gentler Ron    that used to be on this board"
11657,OhioFisherman,2006-12-13 13:55:00,6623,"Nice ride Rodger, I like the decks deeper in a boat myself, especially when fishing big water like Erie. Fishing out of a bass kind of makes me feel like I am walking the plank."
11673,lunkerbasshunter,2006-12-13 14:47:00,2585,nice deal!  Congrats on the purchase!  Cheers!
11891,Rattletrap2,2006-12-14 00:16:00,1652,Very nice Roger! Looks like a sweet deal to me! Enjoy!

12343,tinbanger,2006-12-15 02:17:00,1028,One great looking ride !  You will sure enjoy ( do ya think!)  So how much do you think working at Basspro has cost you  Tinbanger
11346,bpsbassman,2006-12-12 19:27:00,941,"It all started when I walked past this sign at Bass Pro for two weekends before it finally started to kick in.   I currently own a '99 Tracker Pro V-16 (HawgBuster 3) which has been an excellent boat to me and my son Tracker Terry.  The boat for sale is a 2006 Tracker Pro V-16 that was being sold as a demo.  Evidently, Tracker and Mercury loan 3 boats and motors to Ontario Place each year to  be used as Patrol boats.  At the end of the season, Tracker takes back the boat and Mercury takes back the motor.  The boat is in mint condition and appears to have been hardly used.  The thought of upgrading my 7 year old boat for a brand new boat with a full 5 year warranty and lifetime warranty on the welds started to build and I spent a few nights awake trying to figure why this didn't make sense.  It is also a better configuration for me than my old boat.  The old boat had more of a bass boat configuration with the seats down low and a large casting deck on back which was great for most applications.    The new boat has four seats (a bigger floor area) with a much smaller rear casting platform.  This  is much better suited for Salmon fishing on Ontario and also safer for the grandkids to fish out of.      I called the Tracker guys to find out what kind of employee discount I would get and then it became a no brainer.  The 60 Merc from my '99 is still in great running condition, so I will be switching it to the new boat.  By the time I sell my old boat and trailer, this upgrade will only cost a few thousand.  It comes with a trolling motor that has never been used (that I will be putting on my old boat), a depthfinder (which will also probably go on the old boat).  The trailer was used twice, once to put the boat into the water and once to take it out at the end of the season.  On top of that, they have shrink wrapped it and will store it for me until April when I will bring in my old boat for them to switch the motor.  Not much to see here other than a happy boat owner    The really important shot of Momma giving her sign of approval    So I'll be selling a really good boat and trailer in the spring.  It wil have a brand new trolling motor and the trailer just got new tires and bearings this year.  I'll also be throwing in a bicycle seat with hydraulic post (doesn't fit the new boat). Hopefully, it will be a win-win situation for me and a buyer.  Geez, can't wait for spring!!!"
11347,tonyb,2006-12-12 19:33:00,1637,"Any thoughts on what you'd be asking for your old boat come spring?  All this boat talk is driving me insane, I might have to suck it up and buy a small boat until I can afford my dream lund.  Tony"
11349,Raf,2006-12-12 19:35:00,3495,Congrats on the new rig Roger.
11350,nautifish,2006-12-12 19:35:00,1416,nice one bpsman  Can i ask why u are waiting till spring?  Ohh and could you tell me what time bps hrs are monday through friday....Am up that way next monday and what to stop in after the airport run but it depends on what time the store is open till   Thanx  Nauti
11351,Terry,2006-12-12 19:41:00,14456,sounds like a sweet deal and the boat with the blue shrink rap looks excited too
11353,Headhunter,2006-12-12 19:44:00,5703,"Nice Roger! And the thumbs up from the Mrs's make the decision even easier! I'm sure your gonna enjoy that boat next year, only problem is waiting that long! Yer hurtin me Terry!!!! HH"
11355,MuskyBill,2006-12-12 19:46:00,311," Hahahaha, Terry!  Congrats Roger...."
11356,dustink,2006-12-12 19:50:00,526,Congrats Roger!  Sounds like a great set-up!!  dk
11357,Whopper,2006-12-12 19:51:00,2174,Congrats Roger!  Always a good thing to have the Mrs approval  Whopper
11361,bpsbassman,2006-12-12 20:06:00,941,"Tony, you have a PM.  I have found that prices are best (for selling) in the spring, but I would sell it now if someone wanted it (but doesn't slide well on ice)  . Bass Pro is open from 9 am to 10 pm everyday, but Sunday (10 am to 7 pm)."
11362,misfish,2006-12-12 20:06:00,29133,"Unplaned eh Roger.  Good on ya,wish I had a picture of my mrs,s giving the thumbs up when I bought mine.There was a finger, but no thumb.   Congrats. I can see it now,2007 Toonie champion."
11366,irishfield,2006-12-12 20:19:00,26272,Congrats Roger...took you long enough to get this posted up. Hopefully I won't have to crawl under this one....
11367,bpsbassman,2006-12-12 20:24:00,941,"LOL I think it will take more than that    I'm turning into the perennial 3rd place finisher.  Hey Wayne, This one would probably fit inside yours with room to spare!!! We should have a Christening party at Lakair for both boats (and any other new ones that might be there)"
11370,lew,2006-12-12 20:27:00,12767,"WTG Roger, the un-planned buys are the most fun !!   Boys & their toys, you gotta luv it"
11372,bpsbassman,2006-12-12 20:30:00,941,Its more of a configuration like your boat Lew...........maybe that's where the seed got planted
11373,irishfield,2006-12-12 20:32:00,26272, Very likely someone will slop beer on the bows when walking the dock Roger... LOL  As long as it's not the Christening style Leah and I gave the Glastron...sliding it up on a shoal...
11374,Guest mistyriver1,2006-12-12 20:33:00,0,"ROGER...I SAW THAT AD   when we were at BPS on Sunday and I was kind of thinking, geez that's a good deal for that boat.  Good for you,"
11375,Smokey,2006-12-12 20:34:00,1278,"Congrats Roger and Best of Luck with the new one. Must be tough walking by that everyday, it finally got you.  Mike"
11381,Joey,2006-12-12 20:39:00,9122,Awesome boat Roger.  We are looking at the Targa (the red one  ) but are still undecided.  What a great present for you and the wife.  Congrats.  Joey
11386,bpsbassman,2006-12-12 20:44:00,941,"I've been eyeing the Targa too Joey, but it wouldn't be for a few years. That 2 footitis is always nagging at you. This one should keep me happy for awhile though.  The old one sure did. Heck, I still haven't gotten over selling Hawg 2!!"
11437,Clampet,2006-12-12 22:52:00,1947,That's the way to buy a boat!
11454,Rich Clemens,2006-12-12 23:17:00,3131,"Our first boat was a Tracker Pro Angler V16 and we really liked it.  I think it had originally come with a 25 Merc, but we upgraded a bit to a 40.  Ran that one for a cdouple years and upgraded again to the Targa V-17 WT.  Lot more room for us, two dogs, and the gear.  I've been happy with the Trackers we've owned.      The one's we've bought have been in the winter and just had to sit there looking at her until Spring finally broke.  Congratulations ..... Now just how long will it be until you pur her in the water ?"
11463,Carp,2006-12-12 23:49:00,1488,Very nice Roger.  I'm sure it will give you years of excellent fishing and boating adventures.  Congradulations !!!
11466,Greencoachdog,2006-12-13 00:08:00,8163,"OH NO!... don't tell me... you're just doin' this to get out of recarpeting ""Hawg""3!... and after all that hard work I did documenting that for you!  Congrats on the purchase Roger (you chose the best way out!   ) I'm sure you're gonna love ""Hawg""4, the layout looks almost spazackerly like my boat.  Glen"
11472,bpsbassman,2006-12-13 00:21:00,941,"If the truth be known Glen, yer pitchers had a lot to do with it!  I was looking forward to doing it in the next couple of years, but after your excellent ""Do it Yerself"" seminar it also had me a little sceered.  The biggest problem for me was finding a facility where I could do it properly and also in a timely manner so I didn't lose any fishing time.  That boat recarpeted would make it look brand new again (you can probably attest to that)."
