The display will start small but grow in intensity as the night wears on. By Thursday morning, Dec. 14th, people in dark, rural areas could see one or two Geminids every minute.

12069,ccmtcanada,2006-12-14 14:19:00,7971,"Yep...gonna be cloudy with rain here too.  The last time I woke up for a meteor shower was when the Leonid was supposed to put on a great show...I think about 5 years ago.  The prime time was 3am, so I went to bed early, set up the coffeemaker and slept.  I woke up, got dressed, had a coffee, grabbed my camera, camcorder and tripod to witness this awesome show.  As soon as I stepped outside, I was greeted with the THICKEST pea soup fog I had ever seen.      I couldn't even see across my street!!  I was not in a good mood....haha.  Now I have a 4 year old daughter....I dont wake up early anymore....she's my alarm clock"

12503,ccmtcanada,2006-12-15 13:53:00,7971,Between 8 and 10pm....saw 3 really good ones.  The best was seeing one above the clouds....disappear behind it....and then shoot out the other side.  Couldn't stay up to see the big show later...the clouds rolled in shortly after 10 where I am anyways.
