If it's set low then you loose the contours and alot of other little things. I usually run mine on the highest detail setting and it works well. So have a look in the tool bar up top for a detail or somehting else along that line to adjust it.  Good Luck.

11684,misfish,2006-12-13 15:08:00,29133,Im interested on how it is.Details to lakes more then anything.I was told it was not worth buying.  Look forwrd to your feed back.
