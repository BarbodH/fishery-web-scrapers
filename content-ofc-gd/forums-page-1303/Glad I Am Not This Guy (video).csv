11859,Daplumma,2006-12-13 23:05:00,1961,there was a guy a few years ago from the Virginia beach area thta used to go to the Bahammas and work the guide boats for Marlin.He went to land a small one and wrapped the leader around his wrist to pull in the fish.The fish was still a bit green and dove.It pulled him down about 20 ft and sat there for a few seconds.It then dove again and went out of site..Scary stuff..gives me the willies to think about it!

12307,huntervasili,2006-12-15 00:42:00,1604,I know... I wanted to see what happened to the guy too... I still dont get why he wasn't harnessed to the boat... I guess thats just a lesson though...
12375,kemper,2006-12-15 03:38:00,2232,"Right so... guy, attached to rod, attached to line, attached to fish that weighs three times what the guy weighs...and nothing is attached to the boat?  Sounds fishy...  that there is a big fishy!"
