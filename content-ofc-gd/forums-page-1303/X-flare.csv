The blast triggered an ongoing radiation storm and probably hurled a coronal mass ejection (CME) toward Earth. Auroras are possible when the CME arrives on Dec. 14th or 15th.  Note: The radiation storm mentioned above is of moderate intensity and, unless it strengthens greatly, poses no threat to astronauts orbiting Earth onboard the International Space Station or the space shuttle.  The astronauts are protected by the walls of their spacecraft as well as by Earth's magnetic field."""
12051,Terry,2006-12-14 13:41:00,14456,well some communications should be affected by that  but the HF bands should open up nicely for the ham radio guys
12061,ccmtcanada,2006-12-14 14:02:00,7971,Heard on the radio this morning (680 news) that they now expect communication interruption and that the astronauts aboard the space station have been ordered into a specially designed area to protect them.

12498,ccmtcanada,2006-12-15 13:45:00,7971,"Between 8 and 9pm last night, I saw a very faint aurora borealis!!  At first I thought it was my imagination, but there was a cool ""wavy"" look to the ""clouds"" that I saw.  A few times...for only a few seconds at a time, it was pretty well defined.  Then the clouds rolled in."
