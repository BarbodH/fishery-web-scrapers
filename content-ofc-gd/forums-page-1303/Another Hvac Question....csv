10721,John Bacon,2006-12-11 01:06:00,3277,"  If you have a high efficiency furnace you don't need to use a chimney.  They are vented through the wall via a plastic pipe.  If you do not have any other appliances that require a chimney, then you may be able to remove the chimney and use that space in your house."
10745,danc,2006-12-11 01:51:00,4677," You are absolutely right John. But I think that in Gerritts case, a mid makes more sense simply because he stated what his heating bills are now and what his savings will be. But you are correct in the fact that an older, less efficient house would benefit the most from a high efficiency furnace."
10751,Daplumma,2006-12-11 01:56:00,1961,Especially if you duct in the combustoin air from the outside(90+).The furnace wont pull the combution air thru all of the nooks and crannies of the house.Went with the 90+ in the old and new section of the house and it saved me quite a bit.The wood stove helps in the romm it is in but I'm sure its a break even thing for the overall house efficiency.

11447,Daplumma,2006-12-12 23:08:00,1961,Looks like a good solid unit with a pretty good warranty.Enjoy the new heater.Make sure the tech checks the wiring and T-stat and sets the heat anticipator for that unit. Joe
11449,Gerritt,2006-12-12 23:12:00,6129,"Hey Joe... it comes off the same line as the carrier unit..  the t-stat wire is being replaced and a new programmable t-stat installed...  I think I did ok in terms of priceing... 1750.00 CDN for the furnace, installation, new t-stat and chimney liner.... hell cheapest place I found for the liner installed was 400.00..  I think I am getting a good deal considering my in-laws just paid 3000.00 3 months ago for a mid (non brand name) and did not require a liner...  Gerritt."
11455,Daplumma,2006-12-12 23:20:00,1961,Good deal bud.I'm not too familiar with the pricing on units anymore.The last two I installed were for my house so the labor was free..sort of... Joe
11473,Fisherman,2006-12-13 00:24:00,7201,"Daplumma: Question, if I'm going to install a new gas furnace, do I have to replace the B vent chimney that's in there now?  It's been in there for 20+ years. Thanks."
11487,danc,2006-12-13 01:02:00,4677,"  Unless your b vent galvanized exterior is rusted, which is possible above the roof line, then it's fine. I've never seen the aluminum lining wear out. If it's rusted above the roof line, then you only need to replace the top section."
11491,Daplumma,2006-12-13 01:13:00,1961,Take a look up in the pipe and like R2 said if it looks good it should be OK.Make sure the new funce in not a condensing furnace though. Joe
11588,John Bacon,2006-12-13 04:55:00,3277," When I installed my gas dryer I was told that I could not use aluminum vent pipes because they would react with the exhaust.  Would this not also happen with a furnace and aluminum liners?  Or, was I misled?"
11624,steve_paul,2006-12-13 12:04:00,658,"We vent dryers with aluminum John, don't think you should have a problem.  Fisherman, if you have an existing B Vent chimney you can use it for your new furnace, it just has to be sized properly.  If you are going with a mid and have a conventional vent water heater, likely should be a 5"" chimney, if you go to a high and still have a conventional vent water heater you would need a 4"" chimney.  Whatever the configuration is, the contractor will put the right size aluminum liner down the existing B Vent to code.  Gerritt, good luck with the install and don't forget to send in the rebate form for the programmable stat - you will get $75 dollars back from the OPA and $15 from Union Gas - $90 for fishing stuff!!!!!!  Sounds like your parents either got some added features with their furnace (2 stage heat, variable speed motor) or some contractor did very well for himself."
11658,Fisherman,2006-12-13 14:01:00,7201,"Okay, did the exterior inspection, no rust, still looks fine. It appears to be a 6"" exterior, 5"" interior. After seeing Gerritts 4 tube heat exchanger, I'm beginning to wonder, mines only a 2.  Mybe time to start looking for something a bit more efficient.  65000Btu input, 49oooBtu output."
10333,Rattletrap2,2006-12-10 02:39:00,1652,"Sounds like Steve_Paul has a good handle on the current offerings of residential furnaces out there. I had always heard that the Bryant, Payne, Day & Night, and Carrier (all the same, made by Carrier!) were decent furnaces, but since I have never worked in the residential part of the industry, I wouldn't have any first hand experience with them.  If you do want to bring in a fresh air duct for combustion air to the furnace room, than I would suggest you install what is called a ""saskatoon loop"" in the duct. Bring the 6 or 8"" pipe into the room, then turn it upwards, and then over and back down. This ""inverted trap"" will prevent cold air from dropping by gravity into the room. The only time cold air will be drawn into the furnace room, will be when the room goes into a negative pressure. The negative pressure is created when the furnace is operating and room air is going into the  furnace for the combustion process. This happens on conventional and mid efficiency units.  Fisherman, if you want to keep a close eye on your older heat exchanger, there are a couple of things you can do. 1) Use a small flexible inspection mirror and flashlight to look up inside the fire side of the heat exchanger. Obviously, you don't want it to be able to fire up during this process! 2) As was already mentioned, sometimes you can see the flames being blown around inside the heat exchanger if air from teh blower is being blown in through cracks. 3) Watch for excessive build-up of loose rust down around the burners. If this is the case, you have a moisture problem and the heat exchanger could be rusting through. 4) Make sure the flames off the burners are going straight up and not wavering around. They should also not impinge against the side walls of the heat exchanger. This intense heat would cause a crack in the metal. 5) Have it checked every year or two by a professional.  They now have some pretty cool instruments that make checking the inside of the heat exchanger easier. It is a fiber optic flexible probe that can be up to 5 feet long with small LED lights on the tip. You look through a small viewpiece and you can see right up in there. It will look around corners as well."
10337,Daplumma,2006-12-10 02:45:00,1961,Saskatoon loop..Ilove it.can I use that line?The chances of the entering air into the funace being that low down here are nil to none.Even a short run on the intake on a 90+ furnace will heat up enough that it wont be an issue.Where y'all are at..another story.Maybe we need another forum for hvac theory.I love this stuff. Joe
10386,Fisherman,2006-12-10 05:19:00,7201,"Thanks Rattletrap2,  turn of the 110 to the furnace and for good luck, set it back to pilot before I stick my nose anywhere close to the burners.  I'll see what I can check out with the flex mirror."
10696,John Bacon,2006-12-10 23:57:00,3277," I think your logic is backwards.  There is more benefit to having an high efficiency furnace in an inefficient house than there is in an efficient house.  A poorly insulated drafty house mean higher heating bills; if you furnace is 15% more efficient, then you save 15% of a large bill.  The same furnace in a well insulated house still saves you 15% on your heating bill; but it will be 15% of a much smaller number."
