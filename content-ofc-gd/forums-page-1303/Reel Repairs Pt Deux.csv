11622,Terry,2006-12-13 11:49:00,14456,oh it's so you can do the work yourself.... I always have at lest one piece left over and can't figure out where it goes
11626,SlowPoke,2006-12-13 12:06:00,2984,"Mikes Reel Repair was happy to take my order and money online on October 19. I haven't seen anything in the mail, he hasn't replied to emails nor has he returned my calls. The account status online still says processing. If you're going to place an order, CYA. -Brian"
11637,misfish,2006-12-13 12:50:00,29133,"Thats not good to hear.Dont mean to pass on a bad thread.  I,ll be talking to my lurker friend."
11653,SlowPoke,2006-12-13 13:36:00,2984,I didn't want to slam these people publicly and would rather have waited to see if/how they respond but since you posted a link I thought I'd chime in with a warning.
11661,JFR,2006-12-13 14:23:00,498,"I've dealt with Mike's reel repair in the past, and did not have a problem with the service or wait time.  I had him take an older model Ambassadeur 7000 Syncro and rebuild as a conventional 7000, new high speed bearing and upgraded drag washers.  This is probably his extra busy season, so be patient, you will be pleased in the end.  John"
11669,misfish,2006-12-13 14:40:00,29133,"Thanks for that tid bit JR.Im sure like all there is good and bad.  Holly,at these prices,why bother to have them fixed.
