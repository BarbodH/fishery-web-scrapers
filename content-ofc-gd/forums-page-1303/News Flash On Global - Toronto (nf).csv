11716,misfish,2006-12-13 16:27:00,29133,"Got to love the look on Pauls face.Right there behind the bench ,he let them all have it.I thought his eyes were going to pop out of his head.  Im sure some of the players felt that wrath of the coach.This team needs more of it,also time for Sundin to be traded.   Tucker for Captian I say."
