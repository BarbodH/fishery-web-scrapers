11904,Roy,2006-12-14 00:39:00,13728,"Well, as a few of you know, I try to make baits with what little spare time I have. It's relaxing. I've been meaning to go out and find a BBQ rotisserie motor to build a drying rack for the baits after they're painted/clear coated. I have not found the time to go out looking for a motor but today I was in the basement looking for something or other when I spied two sealed boxes with the words "" Rotiss-Kebab"" printed on them. WOOOOOHOOOOOOOOO! I'd forgotten that the last two Jenn-Airs I bought came with  their own rotisseries but I'd never used them. They were just not good enough to cook with but too good to throw out. I opened them up and found exactly what I needed. Stainless encases motors with the rods and everything else!  Now all I need is time to build a couple of drying wheels. I know this is not front page type news but HEY...I'm so used to throwing things out then needing them the very next day that this is quite the happening for me :-) Here's what they look like.  "
11919,tjsa,2006-12-14 01:01:00,1578,"Great Roy, now you can put your baits on ""the rack"". That'll learn 'em.  I see you are a pack rat like me, lol."
11920,Smokey,2006-12-14 01:03:00,1278,"That should do the trick. Lets the the pics when you get it in action. It actually looks like a great idea for the kebobs also, never seen one like that before."
11928,mason05,2006-12-14 01:19:00,258,Nice Rack Roy!  Looks like a nice shop you got there too.  Corn Nug
