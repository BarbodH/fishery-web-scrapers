11916,Loonietoon,2006-12-14 01:01:00,1450,
11917,Bob Devine,2006-12-14 01:01:00,251,I was at the last show and this is a great place for all the musky nuts. Great line up of speakers and plenty of tackle to be bought.
11995,fishdawg,2006-12-14 04:19:00,912,Gotta love it when something like this is in my kneck of the woods for a change. Pending decent weather I will be chasing trout/salmon that day..... will at the very least have a cold one with the group later on
12065,bpsbassman,2006-12-14 14:10:00,941,"On a lighter note Roy, one of my highlights of Musky Odeyssey was meeting you for the first time.  Will I have the pleasure of you falling asleep on my shoulder again??"
12070,Roy,2006-12-14 14:26:00,13728,"Whatever powers your boat Roger. I must say I was impressed with all the goodies and quality speakers at the last Muskies Canada Odyssey. A lot of good folks there. I had quite a long trip  but for those who live within a 100 or so mile radius, it's a no brainer. Go, you won't regret it."
12079,bpsbassman,2006-12-14 14:52:00,941,I've heard rumours that there could be some awesome spinnerbaits for sale there this year. Hope to see you there again Roy.  You too Marc.
12086,TEP,2006-12-14 15:14:00,68,Someone say Spinnerbaits? That's SWELL!
