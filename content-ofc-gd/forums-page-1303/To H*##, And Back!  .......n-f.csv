11255,caper,2006-12-12 14:46:00,210,"Great news Peter, Congtrats.  That's a nice area up there as well. My buddy has a cottage on the trent in that area. Maybe I'll see you on the water this summer.."
11267,Smokey,2006-12-12 15:23:00,1278,"Great location, all the best with the new home and up coming Christmas."
11268,1leggedangler,2006-12-12 15:24:00,364,"Well Done Peter and Charmaine!! Wish you both a very special Xmas in your new home.  Cheers, 1leg"
11270,brickNblock,2006-12-12 15:29:00,598,"WOW!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Thankyou everyone......... I'm sweating reading these responses........ Charmaine is in tears........ After everything that had happened back some 4 years ago I couldnt see the day for darkness. Instinct and the need to keep my lovely bride, kept me plugging each day. I dont think a day went by that she didnt remind me about losing our home... Thank the good Lord thats over with. ....and that sucker still owes me the money though and it is before the courts, there was a day when I was a mite younger and I would have handled it a little differently. Well, maybe I'll start to gain some weight back with the stress factor being lifted finally. Again, Thank-You all........many of you were around when all this went down back when and again I send my greatest appreciation out to all of you for the support at that time. BTW... Anyone fished these waters before? We are 5 min. south of Stirling, right in the town of Frankford."
11277,irishfield,2006-12-12 15:45:00,26272,"Peter...you didn't lose everything. Your family stuck by you and that's the most important thing in life. A lesser women would have bailed on you. Glad to see that with their support and lots of HARD work you've all rose above it, and I wish you many happy years on the Trent."

11884,Rattletrap2,2006-12-13 23:56:00,1652,Congrats Peter! Great to see some hard work pay off. Take care and enjoy that little piece of heaven you have found!
11990,Nanook,2006-12-14 04:08:00,565,"Way to go Peter; my wife worked in a Bankruptcy office and came home with many stories of people being knocked down by non-payers.Not too many made the fight back. You did[with the help of your family]and my hat's off to you This will surely be a VERY Happy Christmas for you all, all the best from Nanook and family. "
11999,pameladallaire,2006-12-14 04:26:00,470,"Congratulations!!  I've been there and can relate to your situation.  It is all a matter of one day at a time, no giving up.  Great job."
12012,Spiel,2006-12-14 10:43:00,9065,"....Fantastic, stellar, amazing and fabulous are a few words that come to mind Peter. Congratulations."
11184,brickNblock,2006-12-12 10:03:00,598,"It seems like it was only yesterday that I lost my business because some clown figured away around not paying me for work completed by using the union against me to do so. We lost everything, I mean everything, including our Home a Truck and 2 Boats. Well its been a slow uphill battle and this year I managed to put a new truck in the driveway, purchase a small boat........settle our oldest son into a great job in GrandePrairie Alberta....... And, Yesterday, Signed the mortgage papers on our....NEW HOME!!!!!!!! We are crazy with excitement... It has 196' of water frontage on the east side of the Trent River in Frankford just 15 minutes north of the 401 at Trenton.  BOQ is about a 30 minute boat ride away from my backyard. I've only one strap left on my boots from having been pulling them up so hard these past few years, maybe Santa will bring me a new pair of boots this Christmas. We move in this December 21st......lousy time of year to move but Charmaine wants to be in for Christmas.  Only one pic so far and it is a far away shot of my father on the dock.    Our computer will be down for a week or two over christmas though....I think we'll handle that just fine."
11185,lew,2006-12-12 10:08:00,12767,"WTG Peter and congrats on the new home, it looks like a fabulous location !!"
11186,Roy,2006-12-12 10:31:00,13728,"Peter, some folks will whine that the whole world is against them. Talk to them 20 years later and they're still whining that they can't get ahead. It's everyone elses' fault. I too have watched my wife cry over our losing everything. You pulled out of it Peter (and Charmaine) and I'm proud to call you my friend. You now have a great advantage over lotsa folks in that you've been through the mill and better still, you did it with a partner and family. That experience will make you almost untouchable. You, Charmaine and the whole family have the greatest Chistmas. All of you, take your time and savour the experience that you worked so hard together to enjoy."
11188,motv8tr,2006-12-12 11:03:00,2587,"Peter that is great news!  And when you pull your boots up, you do it with style! Sure looks like you've found yourselves a little slice of heaven.  As for your moving date, wow, you guys don't waste any time, but I can see where Charmaine is coming from, couldn't ask for a better Christmas present.  I look forward to more pictures and your fishing reports that should be coming nightly  in the spring.  Maureen"
11189,Rich Clemens,2006-12-12 11:19:00,3131,Sure is great news and a strong show of your character.  Stand tall my friend ... stand tall.
11190,aplumma,2006-12-12 11:31:00,6896,I am proud of what you have done with the hard work and the sweat of your brow. I am proud of Charmaine and your  family for toughing it out at your side. I am most proud that thru the tough times you did not become bitter and still had time to call me a friend. I am happy that you achieved the goals that you have set and wish you well in reaching all other..... but I am pretty sure that is not needed you have done what most cant in style .  Art
11195,steve_paul,2006-12-12 11:49:00,658,"Peter, that is great news.  Congratulations on the new home and we wish you many many years of happiness in it."
11197,Blake,2006-12-12 12:07:00,418,Congtrats.  Way to go.  Dealing with terrible life experiences can be horrible but with a great family and some hard work you have came out on top.  Enjoy the rewards of what you have accomplished together and have a great holiday season and 2007.
11198,bpsbassman,2006-12-12 12:09:00,941,"Great way to start the day hearing a story like yours Peter.  Only had the pleasure of meeting you once at BPS, but look forward to seeing you again.  That is a beautiful section of the river.  You have found a piece of heaven and I hope it brings you the peace and tranquility that you richly deserve.  Looking forward to some home reports (once the computer is back in service).  It will be a crazy Christmas for you, but I'm sure one you will savour for many years."

Like you we decided to do something about it and all I can say is isn't it a great feeling knowing you were able to overcome odds that many would have given up on.  Congrats on the new house and let me just mention you will LOVE living on the water.
