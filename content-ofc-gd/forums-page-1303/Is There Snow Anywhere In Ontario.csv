11272,brookieman,2006-12-12 15:34:00,68,So the forecast for most of Ontario shows rain and mild temps until at least mid next week.  I guess that halts any plans of winter camping over the next few weeks.  Anyone know where there's good snow right now?
11275,verno,2006-12-12 15:38:00,178,My Inlaws were down from Byng Inlet 2 days ago and said they have tons.  When were you looking at going?  I can call them a bit closer to the time and get the conditions for you then.  Also if you are looking for some good crown land I can put you on plenty of it in their area.

11484,Rizzo,2006-12-13 00:59:00,4754," We still have 6 inches in my yard in barrie, I would think an hour or two north of here should have plenty.  Failing that go to London, they must have some left"
11635,SlowPoke,2006-12-13 12:43:00,2984,Not much left in London. I have some snow on my lawn leftover from the 5 foot snowbanks from my wife shovelling the driveway but in the backyard I have several patches of grass. Would it be wrong to ask her to cut the grass sometime this weekend? -Brian
