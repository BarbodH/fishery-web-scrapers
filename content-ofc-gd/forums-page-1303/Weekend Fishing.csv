11341,Markus,2006-12-12 18:58:00,25,"Hey Amo, nice meeting you Friday afternnon.  Sorry we didn't have time to chat a little more.  The ducks were waiting and Tim looked eager to hit the creek.  I was hoping you guys would have gotten into them.  It was a beautiful afternoon.  I'm now tempted to trade in my waders for a pair of ""amo creek walking hot pants"".  I'm sure we'll cross paths again.  Cheers until we do."
11344,nautifish,2006-12-12 19:11:00,1416,lmao Markus.....  Actually when u said to me was i going down wearing what i was wearing.....I was thinking to myself does this guy really think i am that blonde?.....lmao.......  Like i said had my waders in the van i just dont like driving with em on........Mind you i think i had way to many clothes on i could hardley climb....lol....  It was funny though because i saw you walk into timmies and thought it was you but like i said your GOATEE was not as fluffy as it usually looks on the photos......lol .....LOL @ FLUFFY.....Well u know what i mean.......  Was a pleasure meeting ya too markus.........And if you ever happen to have some duck u do not need gimme a shout....lol  Am actually serioulsy thinking of taking it up myself next yr. Just got to find out about hunting courses and where they are held.
11392,Joey,2006-12-12 20:51:00,9122,"I don't think its you either, I'm almost certain its the fish as I am having the same problem  There just not ready to bite yet, but soon, very soon  Great report and pics.  That duck looks mighty tasty.  Joey"
11406,nautifish,2006-12-12 21:32:00,1416,"Hey joey,You lucky bloody bugga you....  ..lol  Yeah i am begining to think i just like totally suck when it comes to fishing these last few weeks.......I did actually fish another spot for a few hrs locally on saterday and hooked into a really nice brown but lost it under a log. I had proabably walked a good half hr to fifty minutes  through thick bush and climbed what seemed like mountains lol  with lots of snow on the ground to boot.  Worst thing is i had no one with me to film it so that really peed me off........The 1st bite i get in well over two weeks and no one there to catch it on cam."
11506,nautifish,2006-12-13 01:36:00,1416,Hey rich be ready for 8.00am okay.......Wanna try the york erea?
11509,Carp,2006-12-13 01:38:00,1488,"Well it certainly looks as if you gave it a valiant effort. Even if the fish weren't hungry, at least you had a nice meal."
11931,nautifish,2006-12-14 01:24:00,1416,"  Yeah i love me fish but i was not complaing when i was given Duck,,,,MMmmmmm"
