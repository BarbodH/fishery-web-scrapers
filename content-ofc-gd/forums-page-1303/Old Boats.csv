12003,Mike the Pike,2006-12-14 05:27:00,3421,  I bought my first boat in 2001 this 1989 Chapparal.After a couple of years it was not the boat for me.Not great for hopping from lake to lake.Sold her in 2003.    I replaced the 16ft fiberglass for one summer with this little 12 foot Thornes (1980). I only paid $100.00 for her.It is in mint condition no dents and does not leak.This one comes camping with us when I can not bring the new boat.    While I was looking for a deal on  a 12ft tinny my wife had me buy a canoe.The only floating vessel she likes.I want to sell it but she won't have any of that.    So I finally bought a boat I like in 2004 a Lund SSV 18 foot .

12034,Marc Thorpe,2006-12-14 12:52:00,621,Lew your part of of those memories with so many others
12035,Chris,2006-12-14 12:55:00,405, Is that a steeple I see in that pic???
12063,ehg,2006-12-14 14:10:00,2666," Had the same 12 ft. Thornes for 25 yrs, till recently stolen. Very seaworthy lil' craft. Used it on Pigeon and even parts of L.Ontario. Best pic is in my avatar of me with sheepshead from March this year on L.Ontario  cheers,  ehg"
12066,ccmtcanada,2006-12-14 14:11:00,7971,keram....the work you did on that boat is SWEEEEEEET!!!! Awesome job!
11647,SlowPoke,2006-12-13 13:21:00,2984,"My first boat was a Tempest Tri-Hull... big mistake. It needed a lot of work and I spent a lot of money on it including a rebuilt 85 Merc. The end result was satisfying but it wasn't the right boat for me. I eventually moved to London and the boat sat in the driveway for 2 years except for a couple of excursions.              I decided to trade the boat for this Goldwing + cash    I got board with the bike and sold it to my neighbour when my fathar called me and asked if I wanted to buy his Cherokee. I hadn't seen it for a while and we made a deal over the phone. Hmmm, maybe I should have had a look at it first...    After doing the body, brakes, engine, floors, suspension, rims and tires and ended up with this...    And now that I am bored with the Jeep, I am in negotiations to purchase this 18' Starcraft CC...    The moral of the story: I should have bought a brand new Lund 10 years ago... I would have saved a bundle!!"
11762,b2kptbo,2006-12-13 19:29:00,1505,Had a old 12ft at the cottage. Was out and about with a bud and we found a mid70's 7.5 merc at a beauty deal. Was asked if we split the cost of the motor could he fix up the boat and use it when he was at the cottage.  A little TLC.  a DAB of paint.  Now she be the BLACK PEARL...

11945,Garyv,2006-12-14 01:54:00,547,"Bought my first boat when we came to Canada in the 70's at Sears on Lawrence Ave in Toronto. It was purchased during a January sale.  Price for the 12 ft. car topper $235 delivered to Acton.  Pushed it with a Sears Ted Williams 7.5hp. motor ( made by eska )   When we moved to Forest in the 80's I traded it in on a Thundercraft 14 with a 75 Mercury.   My wife didn't like the Thundercraft said it was to fast and I should get another smaller boat so the following spring when I went to the dealer he had two used choices, a Springbock and my old Sears ( which was slightly deeper and much wider.)  When I inquired ""how much"" the answer was $500, so I now had my old boat back at more than double the new price and said it would never be sold again.  Here's a picture of the old beauty from 2003 at Silvr'y Moon Lodge. "
11963,keram,2006-12-14 02:54:00,585,"I have only one boat, old and new at the same time  OLD   NEW    BTW this is the same boat  . The difference is ""few bucks""  and two weeks worth of elbow grease"
11967,Bernie,2006-12-14 03:02:00,3190,hey keram....NICE WORK!!!   looks really good
11970,MuskyBill,2006-12-14 03:11:00,311,"I bought my first & only boat just 3 years ago, in December '03. She's an '89 Fisher DLX, & she just gets better with age....  "
11981,nautifish,2006-12-14 03:45:00,1416,Keram that is awesome what you did with the boat. Can i ask how wide it is?  Mine is a 14ft tinny. But i am not sure it is as wide as yours....Would love to do that to my boat but not sure it has enough depth and width to it.
