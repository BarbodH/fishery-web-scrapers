11662,bassinator,2006-12-13 14:25:00,32,Hello all....was thinking of heading to the Niagara River to experience some winter trout fishing and was wondering if anyone could recommend a good charter service...preferably Canadian. Any info would be great !!  Thanks Jeff

11723,Aaron Shirley,2006-12-13 17:01:00,655,"Frank DiMarcantonio of Niagara Sportfishing is a great guide on the river, as well as Dave Fulop of Fineline.  You can contact them here:  Frank: http://www.niagarasportfishing.ca/ 905-788-9384 has been guiding for over 15 years in Niagara.  or Dave: 905-938-2275   I don't think his website is up yet, but he has been guiding for steelhead on the Niagara River for as long as I can remember.  Don't be dicouraged if your guide cancels your trip due to bad conditions, they know their stuff and will save you a bad trip with poor conditions.  Good fishing!  Aaron"
