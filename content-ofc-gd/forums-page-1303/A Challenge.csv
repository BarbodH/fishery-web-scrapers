I would try and make some of my own with my PSP but i just do not have the spare time.....All my spare time is spent outside fishing.    and thats not as much as i would like.
12154,Terry,2006-12-14 18:18:00,14456,what would you like to see in the  animated gif and what do you want it to do  lift a fish out of the water or just jiggle a rod or maybe net a fish? all drawn females doing these things
12226,Ron,2006-12-14 21:13:00,1683,All drawn females doing the jiggly thing Terry.
12297,nautifish,2006-12-15 00:17:00,1416,LOL  No i am looking for animated cartoon kind of FEMALES either pulling in a fish or sat with rod......Not of me.......EUWW!!....LOL  But thats pretty good. I can do all that with my Animation shop but like i said my spare time i like to be fishing  because i  don't get much of it.
12298,ccmtcanada,2006-12-15 00:27:00,7971, Actually...you are not looking....you cleaverly have everyone else looking....
12310,nautifish,2006-12-15 01:04:00,1416,  Actually ccmt Yes i have been looking. Two evenings of this week i have looked for animated gifs with females fishing and not just males.....  I was starting to think that maybe i just sucked at searching for them they were out they're but could not find then.  But as you can see from this post with allmost a thousand hits now.......They're has been how many POSTED?  ONE?
12366,Ron,2006-12-15 03:17:00,1683,"  Too bad bout the coveralls. It didn't take much effort to find. I only sent out one email, and got one reply. The guy has a website of animated GIFs, backgrounds, JPGs and such. I don't know him from a hole in Adam. He was kind enough to reply to my email, tis all..... Out of 4000+ animated GIFs, that was the only one he had with a girl fishing related."
12406,Ron,2006-12-15 04:20:00,1683,"Here's some more.  They are animated to the best of my knowledge, I didn't subscribe.  http://www.clipart.com/en/search/split?sub...rch=Searching..."
11514,nautifish,2006-12-13 01:44:00,1416,I WAS LOOKING UP FISHING GIFS EARLIER ON THIS EVENING AND NOTICED THAT NONE NOT EVEN ONE SITE  That i could find anyway had a fishing giff with a woman instead of a man.....So my challange to you all is lets see who can find a fishing gif that has a woman instead of a guy.  Remember it has to be a fishing related gif.  & lets just see how many are really out they're if any.

11559,Ron,2006-12-13 03:19:00,1683,"  Ah crap, and here I thought you wanted a GIF. Now you made it more difficult by adding ""animated"" to the list. Time for *EDIT*"
