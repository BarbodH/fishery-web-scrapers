Started out in one spot and got nothing but watched some guys catch 4 or 5. So I moved about 100 yards upstream from them. First drift hook into abou a 1 lb fish. Get him in put a new roe bag on (I was using Chartruese) very next drift set the hook into an 8 lb fish. Go through the same routine very next drift hook into a 10 lb fish. Lost another one about 2 lbs. Not too bad for the first spot though. Moved up to another known productive spot, a couple locals there said they weren't gettin any so I took my float off and tossed on a hot pink roe bag 2nd drift 8lber #2. Land him and about 5 minutes later I got a 3 lber. This was my personal best day of steelheading. Hoping to get back out on Friday morning and do some more of the same. Just in case anyone was wondering the tribs have great colour although the current isn't moving as fast as usual. ATF"

11739,Josh Rogers,2006-12-13 18:06:00,79,I got a pic of the 2 8s just gotta get them developed then I'll post them
11740,ccmtcanada,2006-12-13 18:07:00,7971,Developed?? Who does that anymore??? haha.  Cant wait to see them.  Maybe you should ask for a digital camera for Christmas this year.
11741,Josh Rogers,2006-12-13 18:11:00,79,"Yeah I know living in the stone age.  I already asked for one for christmas too. Thinkin ahead, you know."
11742,Joey,2006-12-13 18:12:00,9122,"Well that certainly is a great day of steeling for sure.  If this is not incentive enough to splurge for a digital camera, I don't know what is  Joey"
11744,Josh Rogers,2006-12-13 18:14:00,79,If I had the dough I would. But at the moment I'm a starving student

12125,Josh Rogers,2006-12-14 17:24:00,79,Yep she was a great morning of fishing. Hoping to get out tomorrow morning again. Taking my buddy who doesn't really fish therefore has never caught a steelhead. Hopefully I can get him into his first tomorrow.
