11843,Terry,2006-12-13 22:43:00,14456,not much of a shot...
11851,Mike the Pike,2006-12-13 22:54:00,3421,This guy needs a new gun or he is blind with a touch of Parkinsons disease.
11854,Daplumma,2006-12-13 23:01:00,1961,I didn't think Art got that on video!!! Joe
11861,huntervasili,2006-12-13 23:08:00,1604,He could atleast compensate some for shot #3 if his rifle was off
11868,fishinfool,2006-12-13 23:17:00,366,What? What? The guy was totally consistent wasn't he? That's scary.
11952,dr_freelgood,2006-12-14 02:22:00,13,They were warning shots.
12010,Carp,2006-12-14 08:30:00,1488,I like the comment below the video about bumping his scope on his beer can. Seems to fit. SILLY REDNECK !  That deer is at close range. A long distance shot would be very dangerous to other hunters as the bullet would be waaaaay off target.  Scary to think there are people like this out there who honestly believe they can shoot.
