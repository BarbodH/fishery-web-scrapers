11323,scuba,2006-12-12 18:33:00,2,"I had a question to ask you folks, but I thought I better start off with a post  We have been hitting LOTW near Kenora the past couple of weekends fishing for crappies. The bite has been slow compared to last year. We are still managing some nice slabs. Just click on  pictures to see bigger pic.    Now to my question, when is the best time for crappies at Nestor Falls? I was planning on trying around Xmas time.  thx , Cory"
