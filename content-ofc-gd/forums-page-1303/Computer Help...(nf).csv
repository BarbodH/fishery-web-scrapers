12071,b2kptbo,2006-12-14 14:32:00,1505,"Good point, Terry. The old thing keeps locking up and have had it looked at and was told basically waist of money to fix. Don't download from net too much as on dial-up but that could change. A couple digital cameras in the household. Old had CD and new will be DVD so more could be done there. Not much into games (kids all growed up). Word,exel,powerpoint, etc. Thats about all I can think of right now"
12201,Corey,2006-12-14 20:30:00,355,"Definately good points there Terry, but still, with the price of computers the way they are, why not... this way in the future they will have the upgrade capability as well as the capability to play their favourite fishing game if so desired.  I used to be of the opinion of buy what you need right now, but the difference between spending $600 on what you need now as opposed to spending $1000 for something that will all but guarantee that you won't be doing this whole thing again in 2 years when you decide you want to do something more with the computer...  cd."
12255,lunkerbasshunter,2006-12-14 22:51:00,2585,I have a laptop and love it!  Its rigged up wireless so I can use it anywhere in my house and on the deck and front porch.  I love being wireless!  I strongly suggest a laptop!  CHeers!
11968,bigfish1965,2006-12-14 03:05:00,3382,"Corey is a network admin so I value his advice. I would only add that you should absolutely spend the extra cash on getting a decent DVD/CD burner. I have two on mine...they are great for doing back ups and pulling off GB's worth of images and junk. I always go the custom route. I would buy the monitor from a place alike Best Buy, but have the box made custom. I'm running two 120 GB hard drives. One for Windows and one for files. The Windows drive is partitioned (100+20) as a scratch pad for Photoshop. IF you run Photoshop the partition is awesome...makes a big difference. I have a junky sound card cause I don't care about that. Also a mid-range video card..not big into gaming but like hi-def DVD's. My monitor cost more than my box...by quite a bit..cause I needed a high contrast LCD at 21"" and Sharp had the one I wanted. They are much more affordable now then when I got mine (natch). I may get a MacTel if they ever bring the speed over 3.0 Ghz and get witht he rest of the world and have better mouse options.  I have a laser wireless Logitech Media mouse. Damn fine instrument. I recently added a Wacom tablet (that toy is a total blast) and a junky Logitech Media keyboard (I'm forever spilling coffee into my keyboards).  Just be honest about what you are going to do with the computer and see a custom guy and he'll make it for you. My guy is in Niagara and I can give you his name by PM if you like."
11991,Corey,2006-12-14 04:09:00,355,"Value my advice? haha who are you joking hehe. Partitioning drives is bad. bad bad bad. Here's the pros and cons...  Pros: Seperation of system files from data files. Good if you have to reinstall Windows.  Cons: - Overhead on the system. Your OS has to handle 2 file tables, also has to verify each partition each time a disk operation occurs (like verifying drives when you open your My Computer icon) - Loss of drive space. Not a biggie, but your file table takes a percentage of the overall drive space. - You will end up running out of space on the first partition. Causing you to install programs on the second partition, totally defeating the purpose of multiple partitions. - Confusion to the user. Sometimes, if you aren't very knowledgable with the basic working of hardware and operatingg systems.  My honest opinion is throw a 100+ gig hard drive in for system and applications. Get an external drive that will connect via e-sata for keeping data on. External drive will run at same speeds as internal drives, but if you ever need service on your machine, you guarantee the safety of your data because you keep the drive at home.  You can get a *very* good DVD burner, 16x dual layer +/- for $40. It's pretty much the standard these days.  If you need help buying a machine and putting it together, we can goto my favourite shop in Niagara (cough summit direct cough) and pickup some parts, cruise back to my place and talk fishing for 3 hours while we put it together and install the software and then you are set to go.  I like to help people with simular interests to myself. Builds a better community.  cd."
12017,xrap,2006-12-14 11:55:00,683,The tower I want has a 3.0 processor and has 800 MHz. I saw some more expensive towers that have a better processor and lower Mhz and saw some that had a small processor and bigger MHz.??
12019,steve_paul,2006-12-14 12:07:00,658,Bought 3 this year - one for home from Dell we are very happy with and 2 from a local build shop here for the office that have both been very good as well.  All reasonably priced and around what you would pay at one of the big box stores.
12053,Corey,2006-12-14 13:42:00,355,"The best recommendation I can make at this point is to ensure that the computer you are buying is Vista compatible. When you purchase the computer, it should also come with the voucher for the free Vista upgrade that Microsoft is giving away.  If I were building a basic machine for myself today, here is what I would demand from a store trying to sell me one.  Gigabyte motherboard with an nVidia chipset AMD Athlon 64 Dual Core CPU (4000+ or higher) 1 or 2 Gigabytes of RAM (DDR2) nVidia based PCI Express video card 160 GB Sata-2 hard drive LG 16x DVD-RW Dual Layer LG 16x DVD-ROM Antec Case & PSU (or another case with an Enermax PSU)  That would be my core system. Make sure you get a descent power supply. Enermax is my preference, I also like Antec or Thermaltake. Remember, the power supply is the only thing between your low voltage (5 & 12) and your 110v wall plug. Something to take into consideration is the weight of the Power Supply, the heavier, the better. If your Power Supply weighs a ton, then its got nice big resistors and capacitors in it, which is better protection for your expensive components inside.  I would also then get a nice external hard drive enclosure that has External Sata and USB 2.0, and maybe even Firewire (IEEE1394). From there you can use the external drive to store all your data (pictures, word docs, spreadsheets, etc).  Generally speaking, and descent motherboard will come with onboard audio which is good enough for anyone other than audiophiles. It will come with Gigabit ethernet, which is faster than any home user will use in the next 10 years.  With that said, the choice of peripherals is totally up to you. Optical mouse at the least, laser is the preference. Keyboard, I like the Microsoft keyboards, but that is totally up to you. Monitor, you can get lots of monitors have a look and pick one. I picked up a cheapie 19"" LCD for the wife for $179 like 8 months ago at Future Shop, no complaints.  If you are going to get a printer, don't buy an inkjet. You can get a colour laser printer for $200 at the right time and the true cost per print is a third of the cost per print from any inkjet.  If you have anymore questions, ask em here and I will answer to the best of my knowledge.  cd."

12067,Terry,2006-12-14 14:13:00,14456,"Corey that would be a great system and good advise  but what are they going to use the computer for..seems to be the first question I would ask......  if it's  write emails and chat on this web site and nothing more then I don't see the reason to buy a tractor trailer when a compact pickup truck will do the job..........  I know people with old windows 98 systems who tell me they  are getting a new 1500 buck machine cause it's slow on the internet I have them bring it to my house and hook it up to high speed and they save their money and get rogers or whatever is available  more then often doubling their ram give them everything they need too  I still love the system you suggested, but b2kptbo what are your needs.... what do you use it for  gaming ,rendering, multitasking? internet,  photos/"
