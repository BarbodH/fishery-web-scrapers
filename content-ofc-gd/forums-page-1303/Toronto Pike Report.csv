11378,snag,2006-12-12 20:36:00,1932,"Planned to meet up with FisheadRic this morning. He was right on time. Early actually. Good ol' Ric I always say. You can set your watch by him.  Ric never showed up.   He did call me when he woke-up around 3pm.  Sloth.  All the more Pike for me!  Anyways, had some great follows and lost one. I was about to give up when this baby hit on the 2nd last cast of the day. Great fight. It had a smallish head and large body. I figured the other pike must ridcule it for it's looks but it's mother has told it there is another pike out there who will love him all the same.  Here ya go....................   ""NOT THE FACE, NOT THE FACE!""   ""Hi, do I look fat? I'm putting my feedbag on?""    Muchos gracias amigos!  More to come.  Thanks for nothing FHR!  P.S.  This pic taken in WAWA ONTARIO, IS FOR SALE "
11383,ccmtcanada,2006-12-12 20:41:00,7971,Great lookin pike you caught there!  Gotta love it when it's December 14 and it's still warm enough to fish.  The long range is showing rain and warm til at least boxing day.....who needs to line up at a mall?  I'm going fishing if it's really 10C like they are saying!  Great pics and report as always snag.
11384,Joey,2006-12-12 20:42:00,9122,"Please don't ridicule the pike, they have feelings to ya know!  I actually think he's kind of cute, please tell me you got his number this time  Joey"
