12198,TJQ,2006-12-14 20:20:00,7806,"Move Over, Televised Yule Log: WFN Launches “Festive Fish Tank” Christmas Morning WFN: World Fishing Network Brings Viewers Entire Day Of Unique Holiday Programming Dec. 25 “12 Daves Of Christmas” and Hotlines Marathon Highlight the Lineup  TORONTO – It’s a very, very fishy Christmas Day television programming strategy.  The famous Christmas Day Yule Log, familiar to millions of television viewers in the United States and Canada, is burning up – because now, there’s some competition.  WFN: World Fishing Network announced today the network will air six uninterrupted hours of a colorful “Festive Fish Tank”, complete with Christmas carols, starting a new tradition on Christmas morning beginning at 6 am ET. The programming will run free of commercials.  It’s for those who’d rather watch the hypnotic, relaxing beauty of an aquarium instead of a burning log.  The programming features six straight hours of the soothing site of a real, 250-gallon salt water aquarium, complete with colorful tropical fish, including the Naso, Puffer (nicknamed “Puff Daddy”), Yellow Tang (“Buttercup”), Purple Tang (ironically named “Blue”) and Fox Face (“Foxy Lady”).  Please see attached image.  The production is backed by instrumental Christmas music.  In the tradition of the Christmas Day Yule Log fireplace scene, the Festive Fish Tank idea acknowledges that television viewing habits are different on Dec. 25. The Yule Log was created in 1966 by New York television station WPIX-TV Channel 11, as a gift to those New Yorkers who lived in apartments and homes without fireplaces.  The programming idea was renewed after Sept. 11, 2001 and gained popularity again as other U.S. networks found it to be successful programming. WGN-TV aired it nationally in 2003. In Canada, CHUM Television ran its own version on its networks in 2004.  The special morning launches a marathon day of unique programming on the network.  What follows the Festive Fish Tank programming at Noon ET, after all the presents have been opened?  A marathon airing the complete first season of the hottest fishing show around, Hotlines,  featuring 12 straight consecutive hours and 15 episodes (13 half hour shows and two one-hour programs).  Escape with the cast as they visit the most visually stunning locations on earth, with supersaturated colors, almost-too-perfect mountains, ocean vistas, and gorgeous beaches. From Marlin fishing the crystal blue Hawaiian waters of Kona to extreme trekking the jungles of Costa Rica to a Virgin Island night dive with hammerhead, and more.  Starting at Noon that same day, WFN personality and pro angler Dave Mercer of the Facts of Fishing hosts the “12 Daves of Christmas”, 60-second segments airing every hour in which Dave spreads good cheer by completing his 12 Christmas chores.  Among the good deeds: Decorating the tree, putting out milk and cookies for Santa, donating to a local food bank, going under the mistletoe with a special guest and surprising lucky WFN viewers by showing up on their doorstep for some holiday fun.  The entire day is produced in-house by WFN, owned and operated by Insight Sports Ltd.
