12008,Carp,2006-12-14 07:56:00,1488,Awesome !!!  Dang! Now I got the itch again. Not sure if I'll have time to scratch though.
12080,Shaun Rickard,2006-12-14 14:55:00,144,"Thanks guys, it was indeed a great day, overcast and calm for the most part. The best thing weere the temps, +5C at 6.45am  Aaron, I'd definately get down there if you have the time, we got all those fish in 4 1/2 hours. I heard that one boat who was out all day had 30 fish, just incredible. We were also only running 3 rods (1 rod each) as we fished the west side of the ferry in the bay. I don't think this weather and conditions will last for too much longer.  As Irishfield kindly pointed out, make sure you check that your insurance policy covers you being on the water at this time of year  As for the pictures, you gotta love those digital camera's  Cheers, Shaun"
12085,Headhunter,2006-12-14 15:11:00,5703,"Talked to a buddy of mine who was out there on Monday, got 33 between two guys! Atleast ten were 12-14 pds, with one 15+ fish... can't wait for Sunday when I get a chance to tangle with them again! HH"
12107,Guest mistyriver1,2006-12-14 16:20:00,0,"Wow, nice report Shaun.  Thanks for posting.  Were you filming for an episode of UOA or was this just a pleasure trip ?"
12160,Shaun Rickard,2006-12-14 18:38:00,144," No, just out for some good old fun fishing. Would have been nice to get some of those beauties on film though, having said that though, if we were filming we wouldn't have caught that many  Cheers, Shaun"
12161,Aaron Shirley,2006-12-14 18:41:00,655,"Holy crap Shaun, that is awesome!  Do you realize that you were lucky enough to fish one of those ""ya should have been here yesterday"" kind of days?  WTG, glad you could take advantage of such a great day.  It's killin' me, I gotta get back there soon!  Thanks for the tips Shaun.  If they are in that far now, I may be able to jig for 'em too  Cheers,  Aaron"
12164,dustink,2006-12-14 18:45:00,526,WOW!  Some amazing fish there....thanks for posting!  dk

12305,Kinger,2006-12-15 00:36:00,351,Really nice pics. Those walleye are huge.
12335,superdad,2006-12-15 02:03:00,353,"Shaun,  Just one word   FANTASTIC..............................................  Great Report  - Thanks for posting"
11719,Shaun Rickard,2006-12-13 16:46:00,144,"With the warm weather that just blessed us I simply couldn't resist one last trip down to BOQ for some more late season Walleye action, and boy did we get into some action. If you're boat isn't put away yet I strongly urge you to get down to Picton, the fishing is hot right now.  I headed down to Merland Park on Monday afternoon and headed out on the water for a couple of hours with Kevin Lavers. The fishing was good and we hooked into 4 fish in just a couple of hours. After deciding to stay the night I headed back out on the water early Tuesday morning. I had the pleasure of fishing with George, Chris and Joe form Bass Pro Shops and we had a blast. On the monday I had marked some good fish on graph which I locked into my GPS. We headed straight back to those spots in the morning and manged to hook into 12 Walleye between 6lbs and 12lbs, both George and Joe managed to land a 12lb fish each, congrats guys on your biggest ever Walleye.  As you'll see from the pictures below, the most productive baits were Husky Jerks and the new TD-9's. The Husky Jerks worked well mid day and the TD-9's worked like Walleye magnets early in the morning and late afternoon/evening. By far the most productive colours in the TD-9's were Firetiger and Perch fished off the small Offshore planer boards  I just want to say that it was a pleasure meeting and fishing with George, Joe and Chris, I had a lot of fun guys. I can't forget my old mate Kev at Merland Park of course, who managed to put me up at such short notice, making this whole trip possible. If you're up for it and want to take advantage of the great weather and hot fishing, Give Kev a call. http://www.merlandpark.com  Most of the better shots were taken by Chris from Bass Pro Shops, I look forward to getting copies from you mate  Below are just a few shots that I took on the trip:          Joe with his beautiful 12 pounder    George with yet another 12 pounder, or was it 12.1    Tell me that this Walleye didn't want that bait    I think Joe's face tells the story in the next 2 shots, looks like he was having a real bad day      Kevin with another beauty taken in the middle of the day      Look at the colour of the bait, who'd of thunk it  "
