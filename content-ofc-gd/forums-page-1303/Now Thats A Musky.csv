11764,tjsa,2006-12-13 19:30:00,1578,"Only plows I know are on the front of pickup trucks and municipal vehicles, lol. I'm sure someone will be of help."

11793,tjsa,2006-12-13 20:53:00,1578,"Raf, I could use that thing to shovel my stairs if I filed the lip flat."
11794,Raf,2006-12-13 20:58:00,3495,  The baits are definately diggers Tom.
11800,Guest mistyriver1,2006-12-13 21:04:00,0,"Raf, who would carry those around here.... JB's ??"
