But I doubt I'll ever get her in a canoe or back in the Woods ever again LOL"
11737,ccmtcanada,2006-12-13 17:59:00,7971,"We are lucky....we introduced my 4 year old daughter to the sport this past summer and she cant get enough of it!  We've headed to local docks and had to bribe her to come home.  One time, we got there at noon, and by 9pm we were telling her she could have chocolate if we left....LOL.  She cuts worm in half, casts by herself, sets her own hook, reels them in, and releases them.  The only thing she doesn't do, and that's cause we dont let her is bait and remove the fish from the hook.  Here is a pic of her first ever fish....she's already complaining that she wants summer back....so she can fish again  "
