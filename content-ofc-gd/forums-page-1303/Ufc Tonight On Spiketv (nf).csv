11957,pigeonfisher,2006-12-14 02:37:00,696,"My wife also trained with Jeff Joslin, Gerritt...  small world."
11961,Corey,2006-12-14 02:48:00,355,"Someone post the results... I am not able to watch it tonight and am dying to know how he does... grew up in east end, main & kenilworth baby!  cd."
11974,Fish Farmer,2006-12-14 03:18:00,2234,Gerrit what channel would that be on the dish? I have Bell & Dishnet
11975,Gerritt,2006-12-14 03:19:00,6129,Unfortunately Jeff Lost by decision...     he was doing well in the stand-up... but Kos was the better fighter on the mat.. and his wrestling skills were too much....  I Hope Jeff has learned a bit from this UFC debut and will return... the Announcers seemed to like Jeff alot in their commentary..  I got a T-Shirt the other night from Jeff when I stopped by his and his dads club on Concession st... it is signed etc... he is one hell of a stand up guy... I spent over ten years training with him and he never ceases to floor me..  Here is a guy all worked up and preparing for a fight... handing me a signed Tee so I would show my support.   Good Luck in the future Jeff I will talk to you soon.  Gerritt.
11980,Corey,2006-12-14 03:37:00,355,"He will fight in the UFC again, he signed a 3 fight deal. Maybe he needs to get out and catch a big muskie... drag it into the boat and practice some wrestling... at worst he may catch a big fish..."
12361,Crazyhook,2006-12-15 02:55:00,1154,JEff is signed to fight in Hull Quebec on January 13th as well defending his Apex title
