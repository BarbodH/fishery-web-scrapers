699358,Lenwaltenberry,2012-05-24 23:05:00,18,Any recommendations for places to moor a 14ft fishing boat for the season?  I was thinking about either scuggog or rice lake? Or maybe another lake on the Trent system.  Anyone have any experience with mooring their boat at a place?
699371,Pigeontroller,2012-05-25 00:03:00,2793,Why would you moor a 14 foot boat?

699378,Lenwaltenberry,2012-05-25 00:18:00,18,"well would be nice to drive up park and hop in boat and head out, also have storage issues with the boat at my house constantly moving stuff around to take it in and out and its more of a pain then its worth."
699402,ctdd2006,2012-05-25 02:18:00,531, why answer a question with a question? 
699436,DanD,2012-05-25 11:21:00,2223,"I can understand your reasoning for wanting a slip at a marina; like you said jump in and go. But mooring a14 footer is kind of a waste because they are so versatile and easy to launch. Then there are some extra things youre going to need to make sure the boat and its contents stay safe. One would be a good quality automatic bilge pump, something you can have some faith in that itll come on during a rain storm while youre in bed at home. A good mooring cover, too keep prying eyes off of your stuff and to help keep the rain out as well. Transom/motor locks, being a 14 footer you likely dont have much more then a 20-30 horse motor; they can be carried away very easily. Then whats the security going to be like at the marina; a 14 footer could easily be floated out without to many people noticing. You didnt say whether you have a trailer for the boat; but if you do, where are you going to store it; your laneway? If having the boat at home is being a pain space wise what about a storage facility; where they rent outside storage space? The boat will be out of your way, on dry ground and likely inside a security compound. Yes if thieves want it, it doesnt matter where you store it; sad. I just looked up U-haul and they offer a canopy covered 10X20X99 for $45.00 a month and you can likely find cheaper places then U-Haul to rent from. A lot of the towing (automotive tow truck) companies have large compounds that most times sit half empty. You might be able to strike up a deal with one local to you?  Dan."

699440,Stoty,2012-05-25 11:31:00,2910,"On Rice Lake, I'd go with a larger place like Golden Beach that holds a ton of boats and is (fairly) secure with gated entrances around the resort. Mind you... nothing there is cheap."
699441,Lenwaltenberry,2012-05-25 11:34:00,18,"Ya you make some good points, I did install a bilge pump with a float in case it rains I don't have a cover for it.  Some of the marinas have coded gate access to enter on to their docks, although that doesn't prevent someone from coming up to it by water.  It has just a 15 hp Merc pad locked on it, so even still could still be easily stolen.  $600 does seem to be the going rate, just considering it for now, definitely don't want it stolen and would prefer to just deal with moving a few vehicles around to get it in and out of the driveway rather then paying for dry storage.  Lots to consider I guess..."
699442,hirk,2012-05-25 11:39:00,571,"Gores landing marina on Rice has covered slips $600ish maybe less.BJ's tackle rents them at the shop in Bewdley very resonable,call them an ask for Ben."
699444,lew,2012-05-25 11:47:00,12766,Another option may be storing the boat and trailer at a farm in the area you normally like to fish. Farms all over the place have signs advertising outdoor storage and it would be far cheaper than a marina and may be somewhat more secure also just for the fact that there's normally someone living there.  Until just 3 years ago I stored my boat INSIDE a barn all winter long for only $150 a YEAR.  Just something else to think about.
699451,Lunkerhunter,2012-05-25 12:19:00,455,island marina on scugog is great. i stored my boat there for 3 years. Frank is very nice and helpful and they have been updating alot around the place. for a 14 footer it shouldnt be too expensive. give him a call if your thinking about scugog
699574,cityfisher,2012-05-25 19:01:00,959, +1 Buddy stored his at a farmers place down the street from his favorite lake... Cheaper option vs storing in a slip.. will be 600+ anywhere you go
699602,Ralph Field,2012-05-25 20:42:00,1018,"Another option, not yet mentioned, would be to look for someone with a garage in your area that no longer needs it for their car and willing to rent it out. My mother allowed a friend of mine to store his boat in her garage after I sold my boat which I stored their after she lost her driving licence due to age."
699611,danbouck,2012-05-25 21:00:00,4380,Down here the average fee is around $500. $600 sounds reasonable for up there.  I would definitely not have any issues mooring a 14 footer.
699799,blue pickeral,2012-05-26 10:53:00,267,"You might try Goreski's on Lake Scugog. Haven't been there in a while, but one year set up a tent/screen tent next to the water and rented dock space for a couple of months. It was a bit pricey but nice having the boat tied up and ready to go as well as a restaurant and other facilities handy. No vandalism/theft that I remember at the time, but did see a few untended boats that were stern down with rain water - make sure you visit frequently in case your bilge pump goes. I would not count on any marina owner to keep an eye out for your boat.  Also, did lose some boat bumpers at another marina - might help if you 'melted' the attaching rope to help prevent a quick borrowing of them."
699811,gordy28,2012-05-26 12:02:00,638,Another option is Sandy Beach Trailer court on Balsam lake The have docks or pull up spots $395 for a dock $80 for a pull up Access to the docks is limited and it's safe Our family has had boats there for 40 years without issue Can't comment on availability though Gordy
