698759,Bluegill,2012-05-23 01:07:00,197,It's a creek chub. Specialist told us that horney head chubs have less and bigger scales.
698760,Rod Caster,2012-05-23 01:10:00,5784,"I guess it's just a horney ""creek chub""....it's that time of year for them you know    "

698960,Garfisher,2012-05-23 15:41:00,229,"Bottom fish looks like a coloured up common shiner (however I can't see a certain spot too well to see if the scales are that of a common, or if it's a Striped Shiner), top fish isnt at a good angle to accurately ID (straight on view of the side is almost always the best for ID help) , however with the reddish head I would lean more towards a Creek Chub, Hornyheads and Rivers tend to get some to a lot of blue on their head (males) when they are in the mood."
