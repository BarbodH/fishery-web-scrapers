699517,manitoubass2,2012-05-25 16:10:00,11391,Gar maybe???  Be interesting to watch the upcoming show! I'm sure he'll be fishing some other lakes nearby in the U.S. as well.
699520,Musky or Specks,2012-05-25 16:11:00,2710,I'm sorry but other than the Tiger Fish show I have been incredibly disappointed. His show is everything that is wrong with reality tv.
699524,bassassin,2012-05-25 16:30:00,152,haters gonna hate......
699536,manitoubass2,2012-05-25 17:03:00,11391," I really liked the Nile Perch show too.  I don't see him as world class either. No approach or technique I've seen him use has impressed me, nor made me believe hes a tactical skilled angler. His persistence may be world class though, I'll give him that.  I think the ""world class angler"" really just comes from millions of fans of the show that really know nothing about angling, or little about it.  Again, I tune in and watch, and enjoy the show, so he's doing something(s) right!   "
699542,Christopheraaron,2012-05-25 17:26:00,3525,"I hope he catches champ, holds him up, and then it eats him!"
699545,Fisherpete,2012-05-25 17:33:00,1814,"It's not his fishing skill that makes me watch, that's for sure lol... but seeing exotic critters with huge teeth is certainly cool. I also get a laugh every time he loses a fish and the sad & dramatic music plays for the next 10 minutes as he stares at the broken line thinking ""Why... WHY?? WHYYYYYYYY?????""  The catfish episode from the states where he went noodling was funny as hell... he measures a 50lb catfish mouth, and says ""This could fit a human head for sure... they could be killers..."" OH THE TERROR, I WILL NEVER SWIM AGAIN!!!  I still tune in as often as possible... lmao @ myself!"
699555,manitoubass2,2012-05-25 17:56:00,11391," lol, yeah, some of the things are a little overboard. On that same episode he mentioned that giant catfish could be positioned below the damn gorging on dead humans, or something like that anyhow. Made me laugh... My kids are all ""catfish eat humans dad???""  I generally just take his word on all these exotic fish, because, well I don't know any better, lol. That is until he started chasing a 10ft Pike,"

699647,glen,2012-05-25 22:18:00,2641,Its alot better then most stuff on tv.  He is a good host.  Jeremy Wade for primeminister.
699649,Christopheraaron,2012-05-25 22:21:00,3525, I don't think so!
699682,Rizzo,2012-05-25 23:22:00,4754,Used to watch until the episode he was chasing a 10 foot pike. I know its entertainment but he lost all credibility at that moment.
699712,BillM,2012-05-26 00:21:00,17367,"What about the Alaskian monsters that ate people? (aka sturgeon, lol)"
699727,Marko,2012-05-26 01:19:00,854,Only show on tv where a host is actually more focused on catching a fish then promoting something. He is no world class but some of his shows are just awesome.
