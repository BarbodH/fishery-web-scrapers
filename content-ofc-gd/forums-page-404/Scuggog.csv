698154,Lenwaltenberry,2012-05-21 11:50:00,18,Has anyone had any luck on scuggog so far? What's some of the best places to try on the lake?  I'm heading up there today to see what luck I can find.
698158,barrystrs,2012-05-21 12:17:00,75,"I live on the lake, and have been out 3 times.  No walleye yet.  My neighbour has had similar luck, and he is a semi pro angler."
698169,Christopheraaron,2012-05-21 13:27:00,3525,"Well, since the opener I haven't seen one report come out of there, your probably better going to rice, lots of good news coming from there."
698446,Stoty,2012-05-22 10:07:00,2910," YUP!!! Rice was ON FIRE this past weekend for Walleye! Took the wife out on Saturday and we hammered them all day long. I talked to 3 buddies that were also out over the weekend, and same thing from them... they hammered them as well!  Find a weedline in 8-12 feet of water, throw bucktails, crankbaits, jig&grubs along the edge and HANG on! Almost every fish we caught really hit the bait hard, no matter what it was.  Bucktails - cast/pitch out along the weedline, let it sink to the bottom and short, SHARP rips/hops off bottom seemed to be the key for us."
698481,Mark Cavanaugh,2012-05-22 13:01:00,3,"Scugog has been slow, spent half the day out on the west side yesterday and caught 4 walleye. Usually a day like yesterday would have been a lot more productive."
698541,Harrison,2012-05-22 14:47:00,2202,"Mark, should of joined us on Rice with the other meat hunters.  Glad to see you posting here pal."
698576,stainer,2012-05-22 16:44:00,13,"I was thinking about hittin' the water this week, launching out of View Lake. Anyone want to join?"
699262,fish-miester,2012-05-24 17:39:00,864,"well like everyone else has stated so far its a little slow motion on Scugug.. so as far as good spots were still looking.     Stainer, you from the area ? i live in off of Scugog Point ( 5 min from view lake ) let me know when your goin Il keep my eye out for ya, I'l be in my blue springbok"
699349,stainer,2012-05-24 22:12:00,13,"  Yeah, I'm relatively new to living the Lindsay area but my grandparents lived on Sturgeon for 20+ years, so I'm very familary with the area.  I'll send you a PM when I decide to go."
699452,Lunkerhunter,2012-05-25 12:26:00,455,i have been hammering the walleye on scugog this year. keep searching. they are there
