I bought one of those Gulp alive storage units last fall, and recently broke one of the front latches (stepped on it). I emailed them telling them what I did, and if I could buy a replacement latch. They sent me not one, but three latches a few days later, no grief, no charge and no questions asked! (I guess they figured that if I was clumsy enough to break it once, that I would probably do it again and they would save on shipping LMAO!)  A few years ago had a similar experience with them with one of my bigger tackleboxes - and they came thru on that one too."
