Every dealer told me the samething yes we can put a different motor on but there will be a surcharge because we can't order the boat without a Mercury.  Well this is not true. I just spoke to Lund this morning and they confirmed they are more than willing to ship a boat without a motor!  So it stands to reason that you will pay more for rigging etc because it's not factory rigged but I've got upcharges ranging from 800-1200 extra on top before rigging etc of the new motor.  So if you've ordered, or are ordering and have been giving a rediculous upcharge like I mentioned because you don't want a Mercury.  OR  You settled for a Mercury because you didn't want to pay the upcharge and haven't recieved your boat yet.  I suggest you call the dealer and talk to them, because they most certainly can order the boat without a motor!  I'm not knocking Mercs LOL!.. I just don't like being soaked because I prefer to choose a different motor.  Sorry for the long post, I just wanted to share the info I have gathered since ordering my Lund."
699466,Dan668,2012-05-25 13:31:00,1120,As far as I know you pay rigging fees as an extra. The boat costs the same whether you get a merc or a yahama
699467,Roy,2012-05-25 13:31:00,13728,Thanks for the update RangerGuy.
699469,RangerGuy,2012-05-25 13:37:00,564,"Yup, I agree on the rigging, although 800-1200 is way to much in my opinion to charge for rigging.. and it's probably to late for me as my boat is coming next week sometime Lund said  But if anybody is ordering now or have just ordered..  Don't let the dealers tell you they can't order it without a mercury.. that's Bull!"
