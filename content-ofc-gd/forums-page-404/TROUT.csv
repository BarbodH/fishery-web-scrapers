699350,skidoosafari,2012-05-24 22:14:00,46,I was out for a walk this afternoon and came across a small feeder stream that had atleast 2 dozen browns. They were anywhere from fingerings to a couple pounds each. Couldn't believe my eyes. They were mixed in with a bunch of small largemouth. Wish I had of had my camera with me. May have to go back later and take some pics. It was great to see them good sign of a healthy water system
