699245,NAW,2012-05-24 16:55:00,4022,I should have done that with the Muskey I lost boat side on Sparrow a few years back!

699249,Rizzo,2012-05-24 17:02:00,4754,do you think they released it (again) after that?
699251,woodenboater,2012-05-24 17:03:00,2277," nah, looks he dropped them in the boat seconds before he made like Phelps.  guy earned his tip if he was the guide"
699256,Christopheraaron,2012-05-24 17:19:00,3525,"Try doing that with a perch, I did"

699322,bdox,2012-05-24 20:28:00,329,He was just doing what any good guide would do when you just lost your client's trophy
699398,skidoosafari,2012-05-25 02:03:00,46,"Ha, can't say I've done that for a fish but a few years back my son and I were fishn in pittock puddle and he dropped his pole in the drink. So in I went, bout 10or 12 ft down,took a couple of dives but I found it. Cleaned her all up an still in use today."
699483,jimmer,2012-05-25 14:35:00,2730,"I had a muskie on up at the French a few years back and the hook popped out beside the boat. I just slowly reached down and grabbed it by the gill plate and lifted it out of the water. Don't think it even knew what was going on, it was a quick fight. I wouldn't have jumped in after it though, I had a run in with muskie teeth in the past and it wasn't pretty."
