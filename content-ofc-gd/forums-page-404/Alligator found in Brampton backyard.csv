699280,jedimaster,2012-05-24 18:40:00,3472,Only in brampton would they need a bylaw to make owning an alligator an offense...
699318,Freshtrax,2012-05-24 20:09:00,2215,I would hook him through the lips and go pike fishing.   Lol that would be crazy to walk out and find.   I might have to keep him in the bathtub if I did.
699324,jedimaster,2012-05-24 20:36:00,3472,Honestly I think the thought would cross my mind to keep it. haha
699326,uglyfish,2012-05-24 20:39:00,981,I would totally keep it! Would be great motivation for my kids to behave!! Haha
699327,jedimaster,2012-05-24 20:42:00,3472, My only concern would be it might cost and arm and a leg to keep it fed.....
699332,johnnyb,2012-05-24 20:49:00,3413,Craziness -- my son actually walks down that street to go to school
699340,pics,2012-05-24 21:15:00,1268,Why didn't the swat team come in and shoot it??....lol
699343,Christopheraaron,2012-05-24 21:22:00,3525, and catch this...   
699432,Stoty,2012-05-25 11:02:00,2910,"Gee... I wonder why they can't seem to find the person who's ""pet"" it was.... maybe its something to do with being charged?!"
699457,ricoboxing,2012-05-25 12:49:00,398,"back in the day, they used to sell baby caimans at pet stores. This is what happens to them when they get big"
699461,Lunker777,2012-05-25 13:08:00,866,"I havent looked at the article.... but I HIGHLY doubt it was an ""alligator"" ... most likely a ""caymen"" which can be purchased @ local pet shops. ( usually have to be ordered in)  They belong to the Iguana family, but are very often linked to gators and Crocs because they look like them & will grow to be 6-14 ft long. But like iguanas.... people will buy them because they look ""cool"" when they are babies... but as time goes on... all of a sudden it gets to big and has to find a new home."

699525,whiskywizard,2012-05-25 16:32:00,305,  Was it already  in somebody's white bucket?
699537,ecmilley,2012-05-25 17:07:00,2163,what a croc
699553,Roy,2012-05-25 17:50:00,13728,The one in the picture is an alligator. A caiman lizard is completely different and does not resemble any of the crocodilians.
699583,SirCranksalot,2012-05-25 19:41:00,3291,Illegal you say?? Well I be darned! . I live on the river so I'll have no trouble getting rid of mine----but some steelheaders might get a rude surprise in the fall.
699584,Pikeslayer,2012-05-25 19:44:00,1443,I just noticed this thread. Been out for days looking for the missing family pet. Anybody have an address for this Brampton house????

699626,tb4me,2012-05-25 21:34:00,3295,Thats a good possibility I hadnt thought of..
699765,John Bacon,2012-05-26 04:06:00,3277,      A caiman and a caiman lizard are two completely different animals.  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caiman  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Caiman_Lizard
699877,Carp,2012-05-26 18:04:00,1488,"Alligators in Brampton, Bears in Burlington, Milton and Newmarket. Deer running around on the Gardiner Expressway in Toronto. Wildlife reclaiming their land. I love it ! What's next ? Godzilla rising from the depths of Lake Ontario and terrorizing the GTA ? I'll bet there are quite a few city folks who supported banning the spring bear hunt that are rethinking their decision."
