Anyone else have this problem? Help my buddy Terry fix it.   Ya it,s Terrys, and we all know his reputation on breaking things,but this is the first time,it,s been used by him.  "

699931,spincast,2012-05-26 22:01:00,3279,"were you leaning on the housing at all? I've done that more than once. Also was this right from the top, or only once you were down already? I run 8lb balls, and past 90 ft they need a hand pulling things down. Could alos be the tension nut has tighted up too much, Pop the lid and check the nut on the top of the spool. You should be able to test in the driveway. i had that with my manuals a few years ago."
699932,misfish,2012-05-26 22:19:00,29133,No. The lever seem to be real free.The brake was not releasing properly. Engaging the up was no issue.
