I have already tried J.B weld and all the epoxy stuff you can buy and they only seem to last the season ( if even that long) I was curious if anybody ever used the  stuff you get a canadian tire to coat the inside of a pickup boxe as waterproofing?

My Bud had a cracked canoe ( not the beer ) and bought 2 cans at an As Seen on TV , he used it last fall for hunting, no leaks ... This past long weekend , no leaks ..  It stands up to pressure and shifting and UV rays doesn't  "" dry out "" and crack or peel or freeze... I'm sold...  Randy "
699405,hooked!,2012-05-25 02:31:00,38,"I had a similar issue with my boat.  I ended up drilling out the problem rivets and replacing them with closed-end rivets.  Before setting the rivet in the hole, I coated it in marine grade silicon.  Once all the problem rivets were replaced, I sealed all the rivets and seams with Gluvit - it's expensive stuff, but it works!  I've had the boat in the water for two seasons and it hasn't leaked at all."
