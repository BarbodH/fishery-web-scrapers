699856,Carp,2012-05-26 17:12:00,1488,"Last minute decision to fish Rice Lake for the wally opener. Bought some at the bait store on Jane St. in Toronto, just south of 401. $5 for 2 dozen."
699857,Carp,2012-05-26 17:15:00,1488, $1.00 per ten worms. Don't think you'll find cheaper without picking them yourself.
699865,SirCranksalot,2012-05-26 17:31:00,3291,"A friend of mine hauls tractor trailer loads of worms from Ont to as far away as N. Dakota,(which I find hard to believe) so there must be money to  be made somewhere."
699669,hoosieratc,2012-05-25 22:55:00,2,My dad is in the Espanola area this week for a fishing trip. He called this morning and said the local bait stores are charging anywhere from $3-$4 for a dozen of worms. Has anyone else seen an increase in prices like this?
699671,Whitespinnerbait,2012-05-25 22:58:00,2038,That's cheap....there $5.00 or more in the Ottawa area
699675,Roy,2012-05-25 23:02:00,13728,"Yeah, they're about $5 here too. I rarely buy them although I did buy some last week. If I mow the lawn before a good rain, I can go out late that night and pick enough for the season."
699684,misfish,2012-05-25 23:27:00,29133,"Their still out, at your wake up time as well Bud.  If you are late getting up,maybe get Lew to pick and ship.  I don,t buy worms."
699686,Skipper D,2012-05-25 23:29:00,1970,"Some things not right , my buddy brings the worms with him from Toronto when we go fishing and he tells me he pays 3.00 for two dozen , i don't know where , but i know they cost me 3.50 a dozen here in Barrie"
699688,mercman,2012-05-25 23:34:00,7054,  Prolly gets them shipped from Roy
699690,Skipper D,2012-05-25 23:41:00,1970,"  then he owes Roy senven bucks ,  am not paying it ............"
699694,Big Cliff,2012-05-25 23:48:00,6899,I get them here for $12.00 a hundred.
699702,beagle dad,2012-05-25 23:56:00,224,no wonder the fish you catch are so fat  cliff   feeding them worms by the hundreds now  lool
699703,Fishmaster,2012-05-25 23:58:00,920,Only $2.50 a doz here
699704,kickingfrog,2012-05-25 23:59:00,8333,Haven't needed a live worm in years. It is easy enough to pick your own if you don't like the price. For others $5 for a day's bait is not a big deal.
699705,Skipper D,2012-05-26 00:00:00,1970,"  Well then Cliff , bring twelve and lets go fishing ......lol"
699706,Big Cliff,2012-05-26 00:01:00,6899," Ya, but 100 worms here, 90 of them go to kids fishing of my dock, the other 10 usually go to the robins LOL. You know me, I seldom use live bait!"
699710,beagle dad,2012-05-26 00:11:00,224,WORM IN ESPANOLA AREA ARE A HARDIER SPECIES THEREFORE MORE EXPENSIVE ..EVER SEE 1 CRAWL THROUGH ALL THAT ROCK  LOL
699714,danc,2012-05-26 00:27:00,4677, I think it's been over a decade since I used a live bait as well Cliff.
699715,DRIFTER_016,2012-05-26 00:30:00,10439,"I used to have a big worm box (18""X18""X36"") that I would load up every spring by picking on the local baseball fields. Never had to buy worms."
699717,Fish Farmer,2012-05-26 00:39:00,2234,"Buy yourself Chomper Worms. No need for real anymore. That's what I use now. They work great, the only thing they chase your buddy's out of the boat with their smell. Chompers - by TableRock Bait & Tackle Company Their site is down right now."
699723,capt_hooked,2012-05-26 01:03:00,212,Fish digest worms better than plastic.  $2.65/doz here plus $.35 to the government. Wonder how much the pickers make these days?  the capt..
699746,Rod Caster,2012-05-26 02:28:00,5784,"I don't mind paying up to 5.00 for a doz. If I didn't like it, I'd pick my own. Plus Its still cheaper and more edible than a mcdonalds combo."
699750,mercman,2012-05-26 02:43:00,7054,"Was  at the fish market the other day. Asked the girl how much for crabs. She said they were going for 12.95 per Lb. I reached out and grabbed her hand and said ""Shake hands with a Millionaire"""
699764,northernpike56,2012-05-26 03:56:00,717,"where I live (burlington), worms are about $3-3.50/dozen. I will buy them when I'm in a hurry or don't have any left over from previous trips, but when I have a few minutes to kill I will go and flood a small portion of my backyard with the garden hose. The usual 'haul' is around 2-3 doz., but sometimes I get 5-6. I tend to find that the 'wild' worms are more fat and lively as well, and the trout seem to like them more."
699776,mike rousseau,2012-05-26 06:28:00,4661,I only use worms for spring bullhead catfish season...they're around 4.50 for 18 here.... And you get a lot of bullhead with 18 worms... So I don't mind paying...  Other then that worms have been replaced by gulp products for me...
699793,Handlebarz,2012-05-26 10:28:00,3790,Mike I'm with you I have not used worms in years until last weekend when the wife was up 3-0 on worms I switched up and came back for a 5-4 lead lol. I just picked 65 worms last night in about 1 hour were ready for tge next trip. I will still use gulp but on the days like last week real meat is a must.
699813,scugpg,2012-05-26 12:25:00,1373,I'm interested to try gulp worms especially when you roll though a school of pannies when targeting walleye should save re baiting quite a bit
699850,tb4me,2012-05-26 16:28:00,3295,Go to the bait shop in Havelock.. They sell them for 10 bux a hundred..Great deal..
