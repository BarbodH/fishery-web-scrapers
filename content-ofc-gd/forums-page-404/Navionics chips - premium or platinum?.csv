699616,Fisherpete,2012-05-25 21:10:00,1814,"Currently running the Gold, and it is OK, but I want more detail and 1' contour lines. I will be running this in My Lowrance Elite 5. Can anyone tell me the differences between the premium and the platinum chips? It looks like the lake lists are the same, and the HD lakes with the 1' contours are also the same. The price difference ($165 vs $200) is not a big deal, just wondering what extras the platinum has to offer.  thanks Peter"

699628,Fisherpete,2012-05-25 21:36:00,1814,"So basically the maps will look prettier LOL, and I suppose the 3D view could help in finding certain structure. Sounds good for an extra $35.  I saw those features on the Navionics site but wasn't sure if you had to have a high-end system like a HDS or if it would work on my Elite 5."
