Fishing has been very good , classic patterns work well , water is very clear and clean , very healthy population of 14"" Walleye and 25-30"" Pike .... BIG Muskies there too ... If you have a beach front cottage you'll love it !!!  Denny is a great host , ask to see his classic car collection.  Randy "
