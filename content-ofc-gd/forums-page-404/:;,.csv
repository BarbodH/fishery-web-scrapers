698520,manitoubass2,2012-05-22 14:13:00,11391,"Drop shotting is great for walleye.  Shakeyheading worms works deadly (as I just found out this spring)  Bass style spinner baits, slow rolled off bottom or jig retrieved get the big girls to play as well, especially when the bite is on"

698532,manitoubass2,2012-05-22 14:33:00,11391," You can search for my report to see how I was shakeyheading, I couldn't seem to find it??? Rainy River Walleye or something like that?  I was fishing from shore that day, picking apart structure, working the bait really slow on current seams.  Since then, I've used this technique in the boat as well, and we drifted to locate bites, then anchored up and worked the area slowly. I've used Matzuo worms in watermelon red/flake (basically a Senko rip off), I've used BPS worms in a similar color with chart. tips on the tail.  I take the worm and trim off about 2"", then rig it as normal. I was using 1/8oz in heavy current. You can bury the hook to and get in good and deep into the weeds.      Also, I've been experimenting with 3-4"" fluke minnow baits, texas rigged and using a bullet sinker. Nothing huge bit but lots of good numbers so far"
698588,mercman,2012-05-22 17:01:00,7054,"And as for drop shoting, i have a thread on right now with some great tips. Drop in, sit back and drift.It may give the fish something they haven't seen for a while."

698599,wallyboss,2012-05-22 17:47:00,1095,Get some slow death hooks by mustad and give that a try.
698624,DRIFTER_016,2012-05-22 18:46:00,10439,I really like trolling stick baits for walleye. My best technique is trolling shallow divers over the tops of isolated weed beds. I look for humps that top out in 8-12 fow with submerged weed beds and try to tick my bait off the weeds as I slow troll over them.
698882,mike rousseau,2012-05-23 12:11:00,4661,Get on the cranks!!!!!  Troll structure with cranks... Don't be afraid to make contact with bottom...  On average cranks will get the bigger fish... And once the water warms up enough... Cranks will not only get you bigger fish... But they'll get you as many as spinners if not more because you can cover water faster...  My brother used to be a spinner troller... Now (after i got him onto the cranks) he only uses spinners in the spring... And only half the time... Once the end of June hits it's all cranks for both of us...   Not sure about Gbay but that's the case here and I'm willing to bet that's the case there...
698902,Harrison,2012-05-23 12:56:00,2202,"Try using baits like these in, around and along weedlines and breaks.  You can vertically fish them or use them like a spinnerbait or inline spinner.  "
699228,brw,2012-05-24 15:55:00,101," I have great success on The Bay with these Vib-E bladebaits: http://www.jannsnetcraft.com/blade-baits/107311.aspx  I will fish dropoffs and deeper weed edges. Drift and rip off the bottom, or cast to dropoff edge and work it down the shelf. Use a snap swivel (or a small leader with a snap swivel) and not a ball bearing swivel. I use these baits here in the states exclusively in the fall, and we caught 2 30 inch eyes doing this on Geo Bay, when the jig/harness bite slowed. These things displace so much water when you rip them that they will often induce a reaction strike. I also use 4 in Storm swimbaits in the same fashion.  Both are good secondary or plan B tactics for me, right about the time I remove my hat and start scratching my head when my traditional methods slow or fail!  "
699231,Rod Caster,2012-05-24 16:00:00,5784,"Hey Manitou Bass, can show a better icure of your shakey head rig and how you work it? I'm intrigued but I can't seem to figure out just what it is."
699234,Harrison,2012-05-24 16:06:00,2202,Here is a thread from a couple years ago with some other ideas to try as well.  http://ontariofishingcommunity.com/forums/index.php?showtopic=42144&st=0&p=449840
699247,doubleheader,2012-05-24 16:59:00,497," Curious, have you ever tried tipping these with crawlers?"
699277,manitoubass2,2012-05-24 18:35:00,11391,"  Northlands 1/8oz shakey head jig   The worms I used on my epic walleye day (basically a Senko)   Trim abit off the worm head   Put the worm on the screw lock head first, then rig the hook though the worm   The technique I've been using is to cast out, let the bait hit the bottom, then it's either a very light jigging motion, lifting the rod tip from 9 to 10 o'clock, drop back down, then just gently shake the rod tip a few times, then repeat.  You can also use it right in a weedbed, just rig the worm so the hook isnt exposed, then drop it in a opening in the weedbed, and do the same thing I mentioned above"
699298,troutologist,2012-05-24 19:30:00,951,"Check out the latest issue of Outdoor Canada, Gord Pyzer does an article on the spin/swim that MB fisherman Roger Stearns has developed. Pretty deadly and very good at covering water."
699394,brw,2012-05-25 01:41:00,101," No, you can't tip these bladebaits with anything or they will foul immediately. Any weed or leaf will foul them too. They really vibrate when you lift them and  for the smaller ones (1/4 oz) I actually slide a piece of plastic tubing on the line before I tie on the snap swivel to reduce the trebles from fouling on the line.  But they are very versatile baits. You can cast them like a jig and work them down the shelf or rip them vertically..."
