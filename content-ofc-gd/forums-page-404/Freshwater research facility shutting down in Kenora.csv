699174,rmarentette,2012-05-24 12:00:00,124,The Conservative government is shuttering a scientific “jewel” in northern Ontario that has put Canada at the forefront of global freshwater lake research.  http://www.thestar.com/news/canada/politics/article/1179983--conservative-government-shutting-down-northern-ontario-world-class-freshwater-research-facility
699182,bushart,2012-05-24 12:17:00,2628,Having lived in that area I know exactly where that is 1/2 way between Dryden and Kenora  I guess the money to keep that open got blown in a Billion dollar G8 mess---funny how the US can hold it low key recently at Camp David---likely for a fraction the cost  Well everyone should be happy though---we lost the gun registry-----well maybe??  But it won't matter about retiring with time to hunt as now we're working 2 more years

Why would Canada need a place to understand the effects of industry, pollution and development on aquatic systems, conducted in controlled real systems....wait with habitat out of the Fisheries Act who cares"
699312,timmeh,2012-05-24 20:01:00,609,"Seems they're taking the ignorance is bliss approach regarding our environment. If they eliminate science they'll be no reason not to build oil pipelines everywhere. Oh well, clean water never benefit anyone...."
699317,bushart,2012-05-24 20:06:00,2628,  They can do better than eliminate science---they can demonize environmental groups as enemies so you can't hear them either  They continue to spew that Canadians only concern is building the economy----anybody ask them at what cost??  Like a supertanker worth of oil into the Athabasca River annually---and flowin towards the big lake

Research like this. without it, we are in unknown territory and working based on opinions and not science. This type of data is preicelss when it comes to human safety and aquatic life."
