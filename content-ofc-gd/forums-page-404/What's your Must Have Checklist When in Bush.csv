695776,solopaddler,2012-05-13 10:41:00,8605,"Regarding bears, bear spray, and hanging packs I have a couple of experiences to share.  First off in all the years I've camped in the bush never once have I hung my food pack. Not once.  Never had a problem with bears although squirrels are a different story.  Once when paddling solo on a small trib of the Winisk close to Hudsons Bay I did have 3 polar bears walk into my camp in the middle of the night. Sleeping in my tiny tent the clatter woke me up and I peaked out to see them rummaging through my site.  At that point in my tent I felt like the cream filling inside a donut. This particular tale is a long one and I'll end it here. Suffice it to say that was the only time I've ever felt threatened.  Another time I was deep in the interior of Pukaskwa National Park with my girlfriend. We were lying on a beach along the shore of a remote brookie lake after eating two trout for lunch.  The wind was blowing, the sun was warm, there were no bugs, things were perfect. Things were just getting interesting between us when she suddenly says ""I hear something!"".  ""No you don't, just relax, come here"" says I. All I could hear was the wind in the tress and the waves pounding on the beach.  She was SUPER paranoid about bears and apparantly her sense of hearing was hyper magnified LOL! She stood up and calmly said ""there's a bear 10' away and looking right at us"". ""There is not, come on!!"" I answer and try to pull her back down to the beach with me.  At that point she kicked me as hard as she could in the ribs. HAHA!  I stood up and sure enough there was a young male bear. He had undoubtedly been attracted by the smell of the two trout carcasses which were on a rock behind us.  When we both stood up he was obviously surprised and didn't know what to do.  At that point I edged slowly to our campfire about 20' to my left, saying ""Don't make a move, I'm going to grab my camera!""  ""You're crazy!"" my girl whispered angrily, and at that point finally found the bear spray she'd been carrying the entire trip.  She started spraying in a blind panic. Completely missed the bear unfortunately but got me pretty good.  I fell to the ground gasping and wheezing, nearly blinded.  She then grabbed a paddle and banged it as hard as she could on our aluminum canoe. Through my tear blurred eyes I saw the bear jump about 10' in the air, turn and run like a scalded cat LOL!  On the negative side we had to leave that lake immediately for another campsite. A HUGE pita, but there was no arguing that point with her. On the plus side there was some serious consoling on her part that night for spraying me in the face."
695787,SirCranksalot,2012-05-13 12:27:00,3291,Aha! Now it starts to come out. All that time in the bush you weren't just 'doin' the solo thing'! I guess you could have been hit in a more sensitive area than the face!

695526,SirCranksalot,2012-05-12 13:37:00,3291,"I've done a lot of canoe camping. I used to have bear spray but when it expired I bought a set of bear bangers instead.  I think the bangers are more fool-proof. Spray can be a problem with blowback and accidental firing. If you Google it you can probably find some stories that are amusing if you weren't affected but painful if you were.(People tend to wear it on their belt, a bit too close for comfort to some areas you would not want sprayed! :eek An air horn sold in the marine section of CTC, for e.g., might be another option. If you keep a clean campsite and keep your food in a sealed container(dry bag or barrel) you are unlikely to have bears come around. Just make some noise(some people carry a bear bell, others find them annoying) when you're walking the ports."

No trail per say, but there's definite landmarks for us to follow and with gps and maps we'll be fine.  We're packing in float tubes which weigh less than 10lb's rather than a canoe. Not ideal, but you live with the hand you're dealt.  Regardless of how difficult it is I won't be posting any specifics.

We used to make our own fire starters and I plan to do it with my kids this year.  You take an old cardboard egg carton.  Fill the egg cups with burnable material like dryer lint, wood shavings, paper etc.  You then fill the cups with melted paraffin wax.  Once the wax hardens you can break the cups off and stack them together.  They are very easy to light and once they get going they put off an amazing amount of heat!  They can get any wood burning!  They might not be the best for long trips where space is a premium.  You don't save any money and it takes a bit of time but it's satisfying starting a fire with something you've made."

695702,woodenboater,2012-05-13 01:00:00,2277,"wrt: bears and food.  There's not exactly consensus on hanging and all. I hang out of habit but there are some paddlers who throw their well sealed bags deep in the bush. Their belief, borne through experience, is that bears become habituated and learn where to go for food ie: trees close to campsites. Put the pack away from the campsite and bears will ignore it, unless they can sniff it out.  Only time I had a bear experience was in Algonquin paddling interior via main street. When I got back from my trip, I relayed my experience with a guide I knew who was at the put in and he knew pretty well which lake I was referring to as that's as far as many noobs go which=fresh pickings for bruin.  For hanging, I use two ropes. A long one gets strung between two trees with at least a 20' spread. In the middle of this rope I have a pulley through which the pack rope is threaded and this gets pulled to another tree and tied off. Make sure the main line is well off the ground (mine is around 20' or so) as a heavy pack will make it sag a few feet at least.  as usual, ymmv"

Also a small packet of baby wipes are really handy for cleaning your self up as well as a small bottle of sanitizer. I might of missed it here but if your going into the back country you definitely need some bear bells , the last thing you want to do is stumble into a bear and her cubs. If you are going in the shoulder seasons May/September take a wool touque with ya , it gets surprisingly cool/cold in the north that time of year and a nice wool hat can definitely take the chill off especially if it is cool and damp ,as well it is good to sleep with it on when it is cold at night, trust me on this one !

Crazy glue does work well as well.  For a weekend you realy don't need alot. I mean think about it. Could you survive in your backyard for a weekend with nothing? yah probably. the length of your portages and the amount of weight your willing to carry is critical. I have spent alot of time in the backcountry in algonquin. I would bring the following  Basic first aid kit Good hunting knife Something to star a fire with(water proof matches put a pack in your jacket, some in your fishing bag, some in your sleeping bag, some in your backpack) if you take a dunk its not likely that everything will be soaked) The water is going to be cold still and fire is you buddy. Cooking stuff(light as possible I have an ancient tin set)  Forget the grill most backcountry camping spots have grills already, and worse comes to worse use two thick green branches or some rocks.  Water tablets or water pump(depending on what lakes your on) Drink crystals (I like gatorade to make lakerade) coffee or tea whatever does your fancy Some freeze dried soup mixes (enough for every meal) They are light and can be used to season fish, get some with noodles, some with rice, all with veggies... Some bread and peanut butter Toilet paper A towel Soap Folding buck saw(lighter than a hatchet) or a rope saw they are good as well I never bring bear spray but lots of people do. Don't spray it inside a tent unless you are ready to cry like a baby... saw that once.  I bring a spool of twine and duct tape... Twine is fairly strong and lighter than rope.  Tent and a sleeping bag. Bring a compass and a map if you plan on going deep or getting off the beaten trail (I just bring my gpd instead of that stuff now as I know where I am going and I just want to know how much longer)  As for clothes pack the clothes you need then put half of it away and don't bring it. Your fishing and camping not in a modelling contest.  The blackflies will be on full force they were already out last weekend, so bring deet and a bug net for the trails."
695366,Dozer,2012-05-11 22:16:00,896,"Also, they ask at the gates and all, but hey, let someone know EXACTLY where you are going and the route you are taking.  You can PM me the exact location if you wish   I think this is very important.  I know you dont think things can go wrong, but they can."
695107,Walshskie,2012-05-11 01:21:00,58,Super glue it can help in all kinds of emergenceys including medical.  I second duct tape if your portaging at all put it on your feet where you mite get blisters.
695109,SirCranksalot,2012-05-11 01:22:00,3291,I'd leave the ax behind for weight and safety. I have fires all the time but can find dead wood that can be cut up with a small bow saw. If wood is scarce at the site you an usually find some along the shore.  check your PM
695111,krixxer,2012-05-11 01:28:00,274,You need shoes that dry real fast.  I used my ol chuck taylors for many 2 week long trips in the park  You'll also need a few lb's of rice and a big bag of drink mix for the swamp juice.
695118,solopaddler,2012-05-11 01:45:00,8605,"I've spent literally months and months travelling in the bush and I've never carried either a saw or a hatchet.  The tree huggers may not like this but...when I'm tripping through a lake looking for a campsite I keep an eye out for beaver lodges.  Once camp is set up I paddle back and raid the lodge. Those wrist thick bleached white pieces of wood burn fantastically.  Alternatively there's always driftwood along the shoreline.  Dead cedar branches...completely orange will burn even when wet. They're great firestarters. As are pine cones.  A small mesh bag that cinches up and a length of light rope serves two very important purposes. First a small round rock inside the bag makes a great anchor for fishing.  Second, when it's hot out and surface temps are warm, fill your nalgene with whatever you're drinking and put it in the bag with a rock or two and sink it down below the thermocline. Wait an hour or two and even in the dead of summer you can enjoy an ice cold drink.  Speaking of drinks I'm partial to Crystal Light drink crystals especially the ice tea. Yes, there's no sugar or calories, but I get my calories elsewhere. The stuff weighs absolutely nothing. Pretty important when you're carrying everything on your back.  A lightweight thermarest sleeping pad is worth carrying in if you want to be comfortable.  On my long trips I used a thermarest Ridgerest pad. It's a super lightweight closed cell foam pad. A tad bit bulkier than an inflatable thermarest...but waaaay lighter and just as comfortable imo.  I always bungied it to the stern seat of my canoe when portaging. The tiny bit of weight helps keep the nose of the boat up when carrying.  An LED headlamp is now essential as far as I'm concerned. There's nothing better for cooking or putzing around at night.  For what it's worth I'm headed up to the Algoma region next week for 5 days myself. Packing 12km into a brookie lake with no real trail to follow.  Obviously weight will be an extreme factor so it'll be a float tube less than 7lb's rather than a canoe, and a lightweight tarp and ground sheet instead of a tent.  As far as I'm concerned Wayne was bang on with the Scotch idea too. Although I'm partial to dark rum. There's plenty of lightweight flasks on the market made for just this purpose.  Personally after a killer hard day it's pretty damn nice to have sitting around the fire.  There's plenty more things I can add about cutting weight, but I need to get the kids in bed. I'll come back to this post later."
695119,woodenboater,2012-05-11 01:45:00,2277,"I'm not feeling the love for lighters anymore so for me it's a good supply of Red Bird matches and lately, my year round kit includes a steel fire starter/sparker and good stash of char cloth. Warm clothes are a must no matter how gorgeous the weather may look. UCO candle lantern (don't hang from eve or else wax will get super soft and make a mess) is always welcome on miserable nights.  and a good book."
695122,Dozer,2012-05-11 01:54:00,896,"Ya, some sorta powder mix drink is essential, when I was younger we went on a canoe trip and there was a spawn happening, the damn water tasted of fish, without the Tang it was hard to drink.  Also, keep your car keys in something that floats ( or in a zippered pocket on you ), would hate trying to retreive your car keys from the bottom of a lake if your canoe tipped.

695186,woodenboater,2012-05-11 12:34:00,2277,"I think it bears repeating that a proper first aid kit is a MUST. It should be able to cover most incidents you'll encounter. Anti-histamines, alcohol swabs, surgical/ medical tape etc.. LED headlamp is also a must on my trips as is a tarp. While mine is on the heavy side, the Chlorophylle tarp is worth it's weight in gold when you have an inevitable rainy spring days/downpours. and yes, it will rain on you, always has for me  At least one spare paddle.

695190,dannyboy,2012-05-11 12:50:00,367,"Lots of great info here, a waterproof portage type pack is a good thing to have:  Keeps your gear dry, they normally float and make life easy. Mountaineering type packs that are tall and skinny with stuff tied on the outside are a pain, fumbling with several items like paddles, fishing rods, sleeping bags in garbage bags and so on looses its appeal after the first portage.  Clipping your PFD to the stern seat when you portage keeps the canoe nose up.  Don't bother with a saw or axe, you can always collect enough firewood from beaver dams or along the shore.  Double check when you are leaving a portage for gear, after a couple portages someone generally forgets a paddle leaned against a tree or sunglasses on a rock after a meal.  Water is heavy bring a filter/purifier system if the water is not safe.  A can of beans weighs a pound, we figure a pound of food per person per day (three meals), but don't bother with the expensive dehydrated stuff you see at camping stores. There is a good selection of single pot meals at you local supermarket where you just add water and cook - noodles, rice, curries, scalloped potatoes and so on that are great for meals and are light to carry.  Dan"
695191,solopaddler,2012-05-11 12:55:00,8605," You can't put hard liquor in a nalgene dumb dumb.    Huh? Well obviously nobody brings in regular rice. Beyond the fact it takes forever to cook, it's also too heavy.  Instant rice on the other hand weighs absolutely nothing. It's always been a staple for me even on my long trips.  If for example you have 1 cup of minute rice, boil 1 cup of water in a small pot, take it off the heat, throw in the rice, cover, and in 5 minutes it's done.  You can eat it like that but I'll generally throw it in the pan at that point with some chunked up fish, some seasoning and a bit of oil and fry it up.     Being a coffee freak I've tried every method under the sun. I like using a small lightweight french press at times, but when weight and space is of the utmost importance I use the Starbucks Via instant coffee.  Yeah, yeah, I know, instant. BUT this stuff is unlike anything you've ever tried before trust me. It's obscenely expensive but you honestly can't tell the difference from fresh perked. It's absolutely amazing.  A few more things I consider essential:  A tarp. And not the traditional heavy Canadian Tire variety. You can now buy ultalight nylon tarps at places like M.E.C. that weigh absolutely nothing.  Unless I'm on a seriously long expedition I always have a single burner camp stove.  The lightest are the MSR Whisperlite or anything else (there are many) of a similar design. That is, a separate fuel tank attached to a small collapsable burner via a hose of some type.  They are indeed light...but fact is I hate them all LOL!  Perhaps it's because of the amount of use I give them, I'm hard on equipment, but this style of stove has given me nothing but problems. You have to prime them, the jets constantly clog as does the pump.  They're a wee bit heavier, but if you can find one the old Coleman Peak 1 stoves are fantastic. They also make a multi fuel version of the same stove that's great...you can run unleaded gas in it.  They're a single burner stove with an integrated fuel tank all in one. No priming, and absolutely bombproof. These stoves will never let you down.  A couple other things I use is lexan cutlery and lightweight plastic dishes. That may be obvious to many, but maybe not. The cutlery especially weighs nothing compared to standard stainless steel and they're incrdibly durable.  Most every food item and practically anything else that needs to be packed gets repacked into appropriate sized freezer zip lock bags. Again that may seem obvious, but maybe not.  When you're in the bush you'll need some kind of navigational aid. First and foremost, no matter where I go, even Algonquin Park, I Always HAVE THE APPROPRIATE 1:50,000 series topo maps. They show every single detail and are a must imo.  You can either buy the actual maps online at a variety of sources, or buy map software for your computer such as the Ontario topo50 series from softmaptechnologies.com  You can then pull up what you need and print it off at home.  A compass is still a useful back up, but these days a small handheld GPS with the according topo map software for your area added to it makes navigation a breeze.  Another thing to consider is water. Some guys will treat the lake water with chlorine tablets or iodine. Many times I'll simply scoop it from the middle of the lake (less chance of windblown bacteria) and drink it untreated.  A REALLY great idea though are the tiny compact water filters that screw right into the lid of a standard nalgene. You can literally throw the hose into a rancid swamp and in a couple of minutes you'll fill that 1 litre bottle with sparkling clean drinking water.  Here's the one I have:  http://www.mec.ca/AST/ShopMEC/HikingCamping/WaterTreatment/WaterFilters/PumpFilters/PRD~5001-239/msr-miniworks-ex-water-filter.jsp   There's lots more, but that's enough for now."

( We use gatoraid grape).  Tarp is nice but 6mil poly is lighter per sq ft.  very small hatchet, it can split the largest of logs. Be wise about it, instead of trying to split wood by swinging the axe, swing it once to set in the log and then ""swing"" the log with the axe in it against a rock. Trust me, if you need to split logs, go into the bush another 100 ft and you will find lots of better wood to burn.  I got more if you want."
