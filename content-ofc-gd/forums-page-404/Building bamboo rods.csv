I would like to start to build bamboo fly rods, done my research and still have a few questions. First is how can I tell low grade from high grade tonkin cane? Where can I get the cheapest aluminum planing board? Any other opinions or knowledge is welcome and appreciated, thank you!"

699190,Spiel,2012-05-24 12:35:00,9065," No competition to me, I don't do bamboo.  But good luck with your venture.  If you haven't looked here, you should."

699418,Musky or Specks,2012-05-25 03:42:00,2710,High quality tonkin cane will be very dense when you look at the end grain. Its very expensive and hard to find. Don't buy regular bamboo
699447,Christopheraaron,2012-05-25 11:57:00,3525,"Thanks M or S, ya this is cheap bamboo I got it to test with."
