696010,irishfield,2012-05-14 00:57:00,26272, Hey.. but I'm told you shouldn't carry booze if you're portaging!
696028,SirCranksalot,2012-05-14 01:47:00,3291,  But if you take 151 proof rum it's not very heavy.(Can use to sterilize any would as well)
697243,Homer Is King,2012-05-17 14:55:00,305,Bannock is a must!  Mix in a few chocolate chips or nuts or raisins or smarties or anything else you like!!  Anyone ever take Kraft Dinner?  It seams like it would be quick and easy plus it would be a hit with the kids.  The packaging is a little bulky but you could can fix that!  You'd have to use extra water and no milk.

697692,misfish,2012-05-18 23:24:00,29133,"Anyone ever heard of the HOBO DINNER?  It,s very easy.  You make a nice large ground beef pattie,season to taste,take some carrots and corn.Wrap in a tin foil pouch. Place on the edge of you fire.Rotating every 15-20 minutes for 1 hour.Just throw your large potatoes right in the fire for 30 minutes.   When my boys were young and we did camping trips,they thought I was crazy,but it,s all good eats."
699497,Homer Is King,2012-05-25 15:23:00,305,"Here's my Bannock recipe:  1/2 cup white flour 1/2 cup whole wheat flour 1 teaspoon baking soda 3 tablespoons powdered milk 1/2 teaspoon salt  Mix all dry ingredients and add water slowly until mixture is slightly sticky And any extras (nuts, raisins, chocolate chips, etc.) Separate into 3 or 4 paddies Fry in an oiled frying pan on moderate heat until both sides are golden brown  You can then eat it with your meal or top it with Peanut butter and jam, butter, etc."

699591,manitoubass2,2012-05-25 20:02:00,11391," In our neck of the woods, thats fry bread, and its amazing on its own or with anything else for that matter. Even dipped in beans its great. The cats  though is slicing them in half and making bacon and eggers with them! mmmmmmm.  Bannock is cooked in an oven or just over an open fire, looks sorta like a large square loaf of bread. But its also delicious, not quite fry bread good though.  Were having both for my sons 7th b-day this weekend, down at the river (not really camping, lol, but in nature nonetheless)"
695691,Homer Is King,2012-05-13 00:48:00,305,"I've been reading the tread What's your Must Have Checklist When in Bush started by letsgofishing and and thought I'd start a similar one.  What is your favorite meal when out in the bush? My wife and I used to do canoe in trips but that stopped when we had kids.  We are now going to get back into it.  I would classify us as ""intermediate"" in skill level but I always found our meals were very sparse.  It is something I want to liven up this time around.  We will be going with our 4 kids so we will be doing most of the work.  We are looking for quick and easy meals that will feed a lot of people quick.  In previous years we usually went with hot oatmeal for breakfast .  For lunch we often have soup and cooked up some bannock and ate it with PB & J.  Supper would be similar to lunch.  Snacks would usually be gorp.  I've seen a lot of great looking recipes on the internet but I am looking for some first hand recommendations.  Here's a good canoeing resource that includes a lot of recipes . Canadian Canoe Routes"

695708,manitoubass2,2012-05-13 01:21:00,11391,"fish beans and beer, not necessarily in that order.  oh, slow cooked steak over a campfire is also a real treat"

Don't have to sit on top of it and I eat it right out of the pan. Cleans up easy."
695780,bigugli,2012-05-13 11:01:00,6138,"Real smoked bacon keeps for days, and easy to pack.  Good for keeping the skillet greased. Fish every day at one meal or another."

695795,Christopheraaron,2012-05-13 13:10:00,3525," You have it all wrong, bring the rabbit food and a slingshot, just wait a bit and you have fresh rabbit!"
695797,rufus,2012-05-13 13:20:00,267,"  I agree totally. Can't go wrong with bacon. Also, pancake mix which just needs water added. On canoe trips I used to bring Idahoan Hash Browns (dehydrated) which weighed nothing and were delicious. Great with the fried walleye!  Can't get them any more around here but have seen them in the states.  Don't forget the bannock mix either!"

695806,rufus,2012-05-13 13:51:00,267,I should add that eggs keep well for a couple of days burried deep in the pack to keep cool and bread is light and can be packed in a tupperware to keep from getting squished. Bring along one of those folding campstove toasters and you are all set for a breakfast of bacon and eggs and toast for the first couple of days anyways! You gotta like that.
