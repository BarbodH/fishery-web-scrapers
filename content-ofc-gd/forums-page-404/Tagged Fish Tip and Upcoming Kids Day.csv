(He is now    ) Still lots of tagged fish out there waiting for you to catch.  If your looking for a fun day with the family plan to attend the Rice Lake Fishing Festival Kids day on June 2 from 10-2 in the Bewdley town park. Free tackle provided if required, lots of prizes for the kids and a few professional anglers on hand to help the kids land some fish. If your in the area we would love to have you and your family join the fun.  If your looking for a good spot to land a tagged fish this spring check this video tip.    Good Luck!"
