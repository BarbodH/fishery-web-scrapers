699596,manitoubass2,2012-05-25 20:22:00,11391," That made me laugh because about 10 years ago I sat on one of those chairs near the edge of a deck 10ft off the ground, friggin thing broke and I fell backwards off the deck and landed on the back of my neck. Thank god I landed in their garden and not on cement. An hour or so later though it was pretty funny, good times..."
