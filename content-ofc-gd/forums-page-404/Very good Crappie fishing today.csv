699399,limeyangler,2012-05-25 02:14:00,5204,"Hi all,  Between night shifts today i decided to go for an hour session to see if the crappie were done their spawn or not. I was thinking i'd missed the spawn already as the fishing had been slow for them so far this year.  I was wrong.....temps are now around 60-62F and the crappie are stacked up in the shallows where they normally are.  Slip bobbers or micro jigs and minnows worked well( 1/8 ounce jig under the bobber).   Took more time to clean them than to catch them!

699408,icefisherman,2012-05-25 02:38:00,952,"Well Simon,  thanks for the viewing pleasure Bud.   One has to wonder though....if someone is watching/listening on shore how you are talking to yourself ha ha ha....they might make some interesting observations ha ha ha Don't know when, don't know how but I've got to come and visit you for some hot walley/crappie fishing )) don't care about anything else but those two species....  Cheers, Ice Fisherman"

699414,Slop,2012-05-25 02:57:00,151,"You've been looking through this window for a few years now, welcome to the other side!  Long bites like that are ones to remember man!"
699420,manitoubass2,2012-05-25 04:06:00,11391," Thats too funny Simon! When I'm on the shore by myself, I'm singing ""signed sealed delivered"" or ""help from my friends""!!!!  haha, must be us foreigners living up in NW Ontario???  Nice slabs bro, I got some pics coming up to make you jealous as well  lol. (FYI, prefish walleye, lower Manitou trout, NW Bay crappie) I'm saving up dooood!!!!!!"
