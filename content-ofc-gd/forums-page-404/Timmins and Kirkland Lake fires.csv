698377,Moosebunk,2012-05-22 01:02:00,3970,Already.... ahhh sheesh man... it's not gonna be a good year for forest fires I'm betting.
698381,mercman,2012-05-22 01:08:00,7054,"That looks very bad For 2 days,we have been smelling smoke here in Montreal. Wonder if its from these fires?"
698386,kickingfrog,2012-05-22 01:16:00,8333, Gee if you're going to put it on a tee...
698388,Rod Caster,2012-05-22 01:25:00,5784,Awww that's bad. We desperately need rain. More lightening than rain in North Bay right now
698414,Tootsie II,2012-05-22 02:42:00,162,"Those pics are from the one fire burning within the city limits at the city's East end between Schumacher and South Porcupine. The real big fire, now the largest out of control fire in Ontario is located about 40 km South-West of the city and is apparently heading in a north-easterly direction towards Kenogamissi Lake. It would have to jump Hwy 144 to get there. Cottagers and campers at several other lakes were also made to leave. My cousin and his wife who live year-round just outside of the Mattagami First Nation on Mattagami Lake near Gogama were put on notice of possible evacuation to-day by the reserve police. They are about 20 km to the South-East of the fire and if the wind shifts to come from the West- NorthWest, it could get bad for them. This fire has travelled very fast and very far since it was first detected on Sunday. At one point it was probably near ""fire-storm"" status."
698417,Nipfisher,2012-05-22 02:53:00,2449,All my family is in and around Kirkland Lake. They shut down Kirkland Lake Gold Mine and it could cost the company millions. The fire was 2000 hectares as of last night.
698423,carll2,2012-05-22 03:50:00,443," may be from the northern quebec fires, if you look on the sopfeu website theres 4-5 out of control fires near gouin reservoir and abitibi...hopefully i can get back into work"
698644,jimmer,2012-05-22 19:55:00,2730,That's crazy. My neighbour has a place up there and the last he heard was that they were going to lose out to the fire. Every place on the lake will be lost when the fire hits.
699320,kickingfrog,2012-05-24 20:15:00,8333,"No rain, fire burns on.  http://www.thedailypress.ca/ArticleDisplay.aspx?e=3569728   Photo of smoke in Timmins http://www.thedailypress.ca/ArticleDisplay.aspx?e=3569861  North Bay will make room if people need to be evacuated from Kirkland Lake http://www.nugget.ca/ArticleDisplay.aspx?e=3569827"
699341,Dondorfish,2012-05-24 21:18:00,1000,We spent close to a week in the Gowganda / Kirkland Lake / Elk Lake area snowmobiling back in February - what a beautiful area. Hope they get them under control very soon with minimal damage.   Tracker (Don)  :(
699373,Joeytier,2012-05-25 00:06:00,3990,"I am a friends with a few people that work at Kirkland Lake Gold, and they have missed 2-3 days work already, and may end up missing as much as 10-14 days due to the fires."
