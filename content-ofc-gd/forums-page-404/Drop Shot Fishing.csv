699459,Live2fish85,2012-05-25 13:04:00,1633,Drop Shot is just as productive in the mid summer as it is in cooler waters.
699510,kickingfrog,2012-05-25 15:45:00,8333,"    You're not necessarily wrong, but as the water temperature goes up other methods often become more effective. Much of that effectiveness is due to the relative speed of the presentations and the activity level of the fish."
698668,mercman,2012-05-22 20:49:00,7054,"Ya, like most anglers. i fished like that when i was a little kid.Its the name that scares ya. and all the new tackle that comes with the new name.  "
698747,OhioFisherman,2012-05-23 00:31:00,6623," LOL, as I recall a lot of rods had a True Temper label, the same as our shovels."
698751,lew,2012-05-23 00:46:00,12766, And they were about as sensitive as a shovel too Paul
698939,Live2fish85,2012-05-23 14:29:00,1633, My grandfather that got me into fishing years ago has a bunch of older rods.  That was what I was saying when I said that things have improved over the years. I wasn't saying the method has changed. Just the equipment.
698946,mike rousseau,2012-05-23 14:41:00,4661,My dad told me about a guy that used to fish our area...  He only ever used one rod tied the same way for everything...  A sinker with 2 hooks above it..  Just changed the size of minnows he used based on what he was fishing for that day...Perch... Walleye... Bass...  And he did REALLY well...
698952,ecmilley,2012-05-23 15:03:00,2163,"who hasn't done a variation of drop shotting at one time or another think ice fishing 2 way spreader with 2 more hooks tie above ect. to try drop shotting no need to get complicatd, if you can tie a palomer know you can tie a drop shot set up if not daichii makes some stand out hooks that make tying easier, dont even need drop shot weights a couple big split shots will do the trick for cheap to check it out, now if you want to get serious about it, i use a 7'2"" inch xf rod with a shimano stella on it 15 lb power-pro main line spro swivel with usually 8lb seagar leader i prefer the owner downshot hooks but there are several excellant brands i really like the phoneix drop shot weights i use x-zone slammers 90 percent of the time"
699017,Harrison,2012-05-23 19:47:00,2202,"For a few years around 1999 we got onto a drop shot style rig and did well in tournaments on Simcoe and other big water smallie lakes.  We used a 1/2oz tube(no hook most the time) as the weight then a powerbait grub a foot above it. We could go into high pressured areas and still pick fish off.  We got onto this technique fishnig the Niagara bar one year for lakers.  At that time we used a 6'6 M spin, 8lb Pline or trilene, 1/0 bait hook, grub and 1/2oz 90 degree tube.  There is no doubt others have been fishing it for years before that, we just made it work for us and the smallies.  It's sure been refined since then.  Rods, Lines, hooks, bait and weights are all made just for this technique.  A very prodcutive and fun way to fish once you get dailed into it."
699109,eman,2012-05-24 02:00:00,101," Mass marketing and tackle companies want you to think you need a special technique rod n reel for everything to make you better. Sure, I can see some of the benefits but I'm old school and think you can't get anyway with a few rods (ml, m, mh) for majority of applications."
699115,woodenboater,2012-05-24 02:08:00,2277,I'll admit that a couple of days ago I went to JB's and got some VCM hooks and a couple of pencil weights (and my first spool of fluoro.ever) even though I used regular terminal last year. Don't really see a need to buy a drop shot specific rod and will stick with my current rods but I'm also thinking of using the ultralight for a change
699124,mercman,2012-05-24 02:39:00,7054,"Well i am set up, 7'ML action Quantum PT rod. gamagatsu DS hooks, pencil weights, and plastics. I will be using this setup all weekend and will let you know how it goes. If this dont work, you can be sure the spinnerbaits will be getting wet"
699125,kickingfrog,2012-05-24 02:44:00,8333,Less is more.
699126,bigmac1984,2012-05-24 02:48:00,193,"good luck Mercman, don't be afraid to throw the spinner bait to find where they might be (active fish), and then go through the same area with the dropshot after to catch the lazier ones."
699279,SirCranksalot,2012-05-24 18:39:00,3291,I assume that this technique would be more effective in the summer than now while the water temps are still a bit cool. Right?
699282,kickingfrog,2012-05-24 18:47:00,8333,I'm less likely to dropshot as the water temp. goes up.
699286,manitoubass2,2012-05-24 18:56:00,11391," It's during tough conditions that you usually wanna drop shot, like cool water temps, weather fronts, high pressure areas holding fish etc, or deep water bass.  It will work whenever though, aggressive fish will hit it as well  "
699287,Dave Bailey,2012-05-24 19:05:00,1641," Truer words were rarely spoken.  I first tried drop-shotting a couple of years ago at Killarney PP, and it was just a quick and dirty setup. Palomared a hook about a foot and a half to two feet up the line, split shot on the bottom, and a Slammer for bait. Sat the canoe over rockfalls, dropped the line until it went slack, and then reeled up until it went taut. The result? Here ya go:      You can try all the equipment you like, but what's probably more important is finding the right location/habitat, and then putting something attractive right in front of their faces. And you can do that with an ice fishing rod or a downrigger. No offense meant to anyone who goes with their own favourite specialist setup, hey, whatever you're comfortable with. But to some of us it just gets too much like work, and that's what I'm trying to get away from in my canoe."
699289,mercman,2012-05-24 19:08:00,7054,"I imagine the size and type of bait you present, will have an affect on the success as well. I thinks is going to be a'' lets try this'' style of fishing till you find what the fish are after.It seems to be a truly 'Finesse' style of fishing."
699346,Freshtrax,2012-05-24 21:59:00,2215,Works great on 'eyes with a live leach.
699347,manitoubass2,2012-05-24 22:02:00,11391, YES!!!! Totally agreed   
699379,uglyfish,2012-05-25 00:20:00,981," Good luck! I NEVER fish a tourney, smallies or largies without having a dropshot tied on with me!  And don't overwork ur baits, very subtle usually triggers more strikes. The currents in the waters will do the work for u, when fishing very calm waters vertically, try baits that are neutrally bouyant as they will stand out more naturally."
699387,NAC,2012-05-25 01:14:00,369,"Do many people use DS for walleye with success or is it mainly a smallie thing?  What would you have to change about it to fish eyes, if anything? Couple guys say leeches but do walleye plastics work too? Sorry Mercman but it got me thinking."
699401,Freshtrax,2012-05-25 02:18:00,2215,"Leeches are cheaper than plastics by the dozen, use a real live squiggly one. Will outfish any plastic anywhere. Although the mrs. Hates me puttin them in the cooler"
699430,hirk,2012-05-25 10:56:00,571,"I agree on the marketing to an extent but it depends on the technique,you would see a huge benefit to a highend dropshot rod (I went through 3 to find the right one). My 2 best rods are for that and pitching/senko's. Cranks,frogs,spinnerbaits well if you spend much more than $100 unless you just wanted a really lite rod I think you spent too much."
699434,Stoty,2012-05-25 11:15:00,2910," Absolutely! Throw it along a weed edge with an Xzone ""Wacky Leech"" and hold on!!!"
699450,Fish Farmer,2012-05-25 12:12:00,2234,"You absolutely right Bob. Someone just learned a old way how to fish and called it a new name. It's just a takeoff of a Set-line commercial Cod fisherman used in the east coast,only thing they used about 100 hooks. We can only use 4 hooks legally. Fished this method for perch as a kid.  Mercman, you can tie a Tube-jig on the bottom instead of a sinker then a couple snelled hooks above. Just ups your hooks because fish tend to be attracted to the sinker when bouncing on the bottom."
698259,mercman,2012-05-21 20:16:00,7054,"I have an extra rod that i would like to use as a dedicated drop shot rod.Its a 7' ML Fast action bait casting rod. I know i could google it, but you boys have always been wealth of info for me. What do i need as far as line, hooks, sinkers, Knots,swivels, technics, etc ? I have long heard that this technic will catch fish in all situations. Bout time i gave it a ""shot""  Thanks!!!"
698261,davey buoy,2012-05-21 20:30:00,5505,"This will be interesting, I think you have to make your own?. can't buy one if my memory serves me right."
698263,mercman,2012-05-21 20:33:00,7054,  Any reason why?
698269,Live2fish85,2012-05-21 20:44:00,1633,Drop shot is fine with a baitcasting reel. As long as the rod is sensitive enough you shouldn't have a problem.  Paul Drop shot is my main method of fishing bass. Get some VMC drop shot hooks they have two swivels on the hook cut the smallest one off and tie to that. As for line 10# braid and for bass I use 6# flouro leader. Any type of weight will work but that have specail drop shot weights that are good for switching the depth of the hook with out re-tying.  PM me and I will help ya with anything you need as for the baitcaster you may want to put 15# braid on.  I have used a legend tournament baitcaster for drop shot and there was no problem feeling the light taps.
698273,Billy Bob,2012-05-21 20:54:00,5865,"The ""Drop Shot"" method has been around for a LONG time before any bass boat was ever invented.....I just have to laugh at ""bass anglers"" coining it ""Drop Shooting""......that was the first way I learned how to fish with my day over 50 years ago......."
698292,Live2fish85,2012-05-21 21:31:00,1633,I didn't say it was only a bass angler thing. My grandfather also taught me to fish using the drop shot method for perch.  That being said alot has changed sonce you started fishing all those years ago. I just said the method I use for bass.
698305,misfish,2012-05-21 22:06:00,29133,"The method has just been refined,but still the same effect. When I was told about (dropshot),and finally shown,I said the same thing BB.Hell,I was shown this years ago."
698317,Harrison,2012-05-21 22:31:00,2202,"You can certainly use a baitcast set up for drop shotting.  However, a spinning set up will allow you to use thinner diameter line, as well you get a lot better feel with a properly matched spinning rod for this technique. IMO  I use a 7'6 Light action for drop shot, 4 - 6lb test and thin gauge hook.  I drop shot a lot and many of the big smallmouth I have boated were done so drop shotting.  Edit to add; Paul that rod would be a good one for light senko or fluke fishing."
698410,bigmac1984,2012-05-22 02:34:00,193,"Those VMC spinshot dropshot hooks that Live2Fish mentioned are one of the best dropshot hooks IMO, eliminates the nasty line twist that comes with dropshotting. I agree with alot of others here, you can use a baitcaster setup to drop shot. As far as I am concerned, if you can feel the weight making bottom contact, and feel the action of your bait in the water, you'll have no issues detecting a bite.  The less you do with a drop shot in terms of moving the bait around seems to be better, slight movement of the rod-tip to keep the bait fluttering is all that is needed. Its really important to use a weight that allows you to feel the bottom and maintain bottom contact, hence a wide assortment of weights are needed depending on how deep you are fishing, how windy it is, etc.  As far as lure selection goes, there are many selections. Some guys will use minnow imitator baits, others will use senkos, but typically most baits are in the 3""-3.5"" range to be most effective, but if they are really munching, they'll bite anything.  Good luck, its a great way to catch them when they are on a slow bite, but will also catch you lots of fish when they are aggressive to. Most guys will tell you they won't hit the great lakes without a dropshot tied on."
698440,Billy Bob,2012-05-22 08:57:00,5865," OH, PLEASE don't take what I said personl....I wasn't trying to single you out......but rather speaking in general terms when I said ""bass anglers""....we had a much different term used to describe ""drop shotting"" but it's not a politically correct phrase."
698444,Stoty,2012-05-22 09:46:00,2910,"Back to the ACTUAL question...  Typical setup for drop-shotting:  Rod - 7ft to 7.5ft ML to Med rod  Reel - personal preference, but most people use spinning gear to allow for smaller diameter line (same can be achieved by using a flouro leader if using a bait-casting outfit)  Line - the thinnest you can get away with, typically 6-8 lb flouro  Hooks - Stringease ""Zero Twist"" hooks are amazing. Same idea as the VMC spinshot, where they both eliminate line twist by being able to rotate 360 degrees. The other hooks I use are the ""Stand-out"" dropshot hooks that have an extra ""arm"" that you pass your tag end through, to eliminate the hook from ""turning"" upside down during your presentation.  Baits - almost anything, but Xzone ""Slammers"" are by far the most popular (and top producing) baits around the Great Lakes region. There's quite a few ""knock offs"" of the slammer out there as well. Gulp minnows, finesse worms, Fin-S fish, etc are also great options.  Techniques - As with any technique, everyone has their ""own"" way to do things. Typically, I try to move the bait as little as possible and have it just ""hover"" in place for a lengthy period of time. If the fish won't commit to the ""dead stick"" approach, I'll impart a slight ""shake"" to the bait, followed by a pause.  Recognizing a strike - a lot of the time it will be a ""dead weight"" feeling on the end of your line. Other times you can feel the standard ""thump"" of a fish striking. I've also had my line just take off and start ""swimming"" away."
698460,jigsnreels,2012-05-22 11:32:00,133," Interesting.  The first fish I ever caught was a smallmouth bass on Lake Muskoka on a drop shot rig that my dad tied for me.  This would be in the early '70s.  Hardly a revolutionary technique, and I was hardly a ""world-class angler"" at the time.  Actually, I was probably better back then...  :-)"
698465,OhioFisherman,2012-05-22 11:56:00,6623,"I also used a spinning rod, but it was because my casting rods generally weren`t spooled with line lighter than 14#, and I didn`t use braid. A drop shot sinker is tough to get on line heavier than 10# and may not release properly. You can accomplish the same thing using a slip sinker and rubber peg or tooth pick.  The Stringease or VMC hooks Stoty mentioned seem like the way to go, if I was still fishing I would have them."
698472,rob v,2012-05-22 12:19:00,535,I enjoy drop shoting with live bait for perch - great system !!
698501,Live2fish85,2012-05-22 13:42:00,1633,I didn't realize you had the swivel hooks and so on back then. Plus all the bait like they have now for drop shottin my bad. I guess the rods and that were as good back then as now.  Also I did say the method wasn't usefull back then. It has just improved over the years.
698552,Billy Bob,2012-05-22 15:29:00,5865, The method is even more refined for Lake Erie Perch as it is basically the same thing.....But bass are EASY to catch compared to perch.
698559,jedimaster,2012-05-22 15:52:00,3472,"I don't use swivels and I don't suffer from any of the line twist issues people mention.My main drop shot rod is a Gloomis GL2 spinning rod with a stradic and 20 pound braided line, no floro. Improvec cinch knot line fed top of the hook down tied, with a 1-2 foot tag end, fed back through the eye of the hook. Super sensitive, great for walleye, bass, perch, crappie etc... for ice fishing it also works well. when dead sticked with a tail hooked minnow.  I tend not to be so snooty though. I call it sinker and a hook instead of drop shoting. This is alternative to the hook and sinker method.  I like spining rod setup over a baitcasting setup as I just like the feel or a spinning rod better when the tip is held close to the water. With the reel on the bottom of the rod versus on top it just feel better imo. Plus if you are using some really light weights and lures its easy to cast without any fuss. I find baitcasters are good when cating constantly. with a drop shot I'll cast and let it sit for a long time in one spot or slightly dragging. Fewer casts means spinning gear in my world...."
698582,mercman,2012-05-22 16:50:00,7054,Some great info here guys Keep it comin!!! I am almost as excited with this method as i was with Spinnerbaits  Never too old to learn some new tricks (and re-learn old ones too)
698597,lew,2012-05-22 17:42:00,12766," Actually, no they weren't as good back then, infact I learned to fish in the 50's with a square shafted steel rod that was heavy and had the same action as a tree stump.  And we only had very basic baitcast reels cause spinning reels weren't around yet and the line we used could have doubled to tie up battleships.  Biggest change though is we only fished with ONE rod, and we fished for ALL species with it and did VERY well with those old dinosaurs.  Fishing has almost gotten too technical these days where guys need a different rod for every technique.  Fishing is still enjoyable...but it's different now."
698606,manitoubass2,2012-05-22 18:12:00,11391,"I like using small octopus hooks and use a palomar knot with the tag end back through the eye to keep it level. I use a variety of sinkers, but I just double overhand knot them to get out of snags easy. If I'm in current I'll use a good quality barrel swivel and have no issues with line twist, even in heavy current. Unlike some others here, I actually like a 6'6"" medium rod, but thats my most comfortable set up so I'm not saying a longer lighter duty rod isn't better.  The same set up also works well for shore casting for walleye/bass/pike, and makes it really easy to present your bait at the exact depth you want to present it.  I'd also tell you to check the baits you wanna use before hitting the water, to determine the best action of the bait and how it's hooked effects that action. Some baits I nose hook and come out the center of the nose, other I got through the bait and out the top.  For line I use 10lb PP sometimes tied direct, sometime with a fluoro leader. Other times I'm using 8lb mono. But I prefer the sensitivity of PP."
698611,mercman,2012-05-22 18:22:00,7054," Amen to that Lew. When my grandfather passed, and Dad inherited his fishing equipment, i was shocked to see how little he had! 2-3 rods., a few old mitchels.And he fished anything with fins LOL !!! He did have boxes full of lures though."
698652,uglyfish,2012-05-22 20:16:00,981,"The swivels and hooks with swivels aren't needed. Ur gonna get some line twist no matter what, its more noticeable with flouro then braid.  I use a 6'10 medium xtra fast rod spinning reel, spooled with straight 8lb flouro. Trokar dropshot hooks, tied with a palomar knot, and a dropshot weight at the bottom.  Any plastic bait will work. Match the bait to the species ur targetting and the forage in the area. X zone slammers are my go to and win me lots of tourneys, jackall crosstail shads and powerteam lures hammershad."
