690058,Spiel,2012-04-25 14:27:00,9065,  Thanks Phil.  Yes the colour match was intentional. Brian sent me pictures of the reel requesting I match the wraps a close as possible.
690084,misfish,2012-04-25 16:02:00,29133,"  No prob Phil,just dont forget the royalties for both the builder and I.  And yes,like Chris said,it was made to match the reel."
689031,misfish,2012-04-21 18:03:00,29133,"With this being my first custom rod,I was excited from the day I ordered it til todays pick up. I was totally impressed with Chris,s work. Get the reel on and it was a perfect match and the balance was amazing.  On our drive back,I have decided,I am going to get that fixed seat section, once I know where I want it.Just not yet though,I need to work some over time.LOL   Im a very happy fisherman. I,ll be on the river in the AM to give it her first trial hook up.  Thanks Chris, for a great rod.   PS,,,,,,,,,,Thanks for not putting that pink thread on.  talk about BRIGHT      "

689219,Spiel,2012-04-22 12:22:00,9065,Thanks guys.  Glad you're pleased Brian and I'm hoping you're out putting it through its paces right now.
689241,John,2012-04-22 14:16:00,2956," Pretty cool Chris...........I'm still thinking about that CTS blank. Thought you might have done the pink though, it would have matched his eyes!........"
689242,Spiel,2012-04-22 14:21:00,9065, Thanks John.  I considered using pink and Brian can tell you for sure I have lots of it.
689262,FishHeadRic,2012-04-22 16:25:00,226,"Chris, very nice work there. Nice and clean on the cork. Brian can you post a pic of the butt end. If you don't mind sharing, what blank was this built on, and what guides did you use?   FHR"
689264,misfish,2012-04-22 16:53:00,29133,"   Just got in,and yes Chris,it was christen many times this morning.Post later as the kiddies are over right now.  Rick I left the rod in Chris,s hands. What he used,he,ll have to tell ya.All I know,it,s a great rod.  Heres a pic of the butt.  "
689276,Spiel,2012-04-22 18:10:00,9065," Hi Ric, thanks for the kudos. The blank is a 13'-6"" CTS, 4-8 rating.  The guides were Fuji BYAG's.  Brian wanted a sliding ring handle that I fancied up a wee bit with two shades of brown rubberized cork at the ends with a little bit of red Amboyna burl inserted at the back end.   Looking forward to the report and your thoughts on the rod Brian."
689280,davey buoy,2012-04-22 18:19:00,5505," Me two,Christmas is coming:clapping:"
689290,misfish,2012-04-22 18:48:00,29133,"  I was there,where were you??????????????  :wallbash:"

689301,misfish,2012-04-22 19:17:00,29133," Oh come on now,I washed my face when I got to the river,,,,,,,,,,,That woke me up.  I would like to add Rick.When I was doing my consultation with Chris,Mike (solopaddler was there) and they were talking so much jibberish about my rod,I said,JUST MAKE ME HAPPY. And I am."
689437,spinnerdoc,2012-04-23 01:06:00,556,"Nice Brian, I didn't realize you went for the 4-8 cts....it's a sweet blank...you'll love it."
689527,Spiel,2012-04-23 15:07:00,9065," ""Jibberish,"" I don't recall talking jibberish, are you sure you were paying attention."

689710,MJL,2012-04-24 01:12:00,2427,Still think you should've gone with pink guide wraps...Pink always attracts steelhead!  Great job Chris
690054,Harrison,2012-04-25 13:55:00,2202,Awesome job Spiel and great shots Brian!  Did match the Rod colour to the Okuma raw II on purpose?  That is slick!!!  I may have to forward some of these shot on if that is ok Brian.  Phil
