690500,spinnerdoc,2012-04-27 09:33:00,556,"This is really refreshing Mike, I really regret missing out on the chance to fish with you last fall"
690524,corvette1,2012-04-27 12:18:00,1765,great report mike
690537,torco,2012-04-27 12:44:00,656,Thanks for another great report. Your son is very impressive gives me hope for my girls! I also noticed how quiet the rivers were in each picture and that in of itself is awesome.
690787,lovetofish,2012-04-28 01:15:00,500,That male steal head really gave him a run for his money!  He did a fantastic job
690897,Ralph Field,2012-04-28 15:46:00,1018,Watching your children catch fish is one of life's best moments.
690898,TJQ,2012-04-28 15:54:00,7806,Awesome pics!! Thanks for sharing!!!
690904,Jigger,2012-04-28 16:23:00,1237,That was kind of you to let Fidel hold your fish. Great shots!
690331,solopaddler,2012-04-26 15:40:00,8605,"Steelheading is long over now at least as far as I'm concerned. Overall it was a decent although unusual spring with the best fishing by far happening in February because of the mild winter.  The more northern trib's were either boom or bust at least for me. With a large portion of the runs just blasting right through you had to hit it just right in order to have success.  Much more consistent were the more southerly trib's with a bunch of banner days in the books.  Overall it was a much busier spring for me than usual, but I was still able to put in 15 days on the water and managed to fish with several board members as well, so no complaints.  Fidel (Highdrifter), Paul (Paulus), Chris (Live2fish85), Craig (I'mHooked), you guys were all a pleasure to fish with!  A small apology to Craig. He caught a bunch of nice fish with me one day but my camera with all his photos still on it is now sitting on the bottom of the Grand River in Dunville LOL! I will sign an affidavit for you if you want buddy, you definitely did catch some fish.  The highlight for me was without a doubt getting my 5 year old son Brendan into a bunch of fish.  I gave him a custom 10' spinning rod for Christmas and paired with a light spinning reel it's a good combo for him.  Of course he refuses to use it. He insists on using dads $1500 centerpin rod and reel LOL!  Obviously he couldn't cast far enough, so I'd make the cast then hand the rod to him.  He did everything else.   Here's a couple video clips of the action:  <iframe width=""420"" height=""315"" src=""http://www.youtube.com/embed/N7gPhss8AmU"" frameborder=""0"" allowfullscreen></iframe>  <iframe width=""420"" height=""315"" src=""http://www.youtube.com/embed/dbq1XgTH0N4"" frameborder=""0"" allowfullscreen></iframe>   And a few of the better photos:                                                                      The long sticks are now on the shelf 'till probably October.  It's now time to concentrate on some other species starting this weekend with brookies in Algonquin park."
690333,Rod Caster,2012-04-26 15:45:00,5784,"Those are some big, lonely rivers Gotta adapt according to weather, eh?  Some of those shots are wallpaper quality, but I still like the boy with the stringer shot the most haha."
690334,asdve23rveavwa,2012-04-26 15:47:00,2690,"Good stuff, Mike!! Love the shots of Brendan holding the bows! I never did hit the rivers this winter/spring, looking forward to the fall for that. Good luck at Algonquin, looking forward to some shots of nice brookies!"
690336,misfish,2012-04-26 15:52:00,29133,Real nice Mike.   I cant say thats my plans yet.I think I got another 2 weekends left. Looking at them all summer is going to be painful.LOL  Have a good one at AP.
690359,solopaddler,2012-04-26 18:32:00,8605," Me too.    Thanks Frank, maybe next fall we can get out together.     Ugh....another steelheader is born. LOL!"
690380,lovetofish,2012-04-26 20:09:00,500,Great pics!  Love the one with the little guy holding the fish!  LTF
690382,misfish,2012-04-26 20:14:00,29133, 
690383,landry,2012-04-26 20:17:00,1005,I enjoyed your report and pics. Have not been to that southern-most river pictured above as I don't steelhead much anymore. I used to make the trip there almost every weekend 15+ years ago - when it wasn't fished so hard. Great memories. BTW - I think we met real briefly at the dock in Dunnville as you were just heading out (and lose your camers?). Landry  
690387,solopaddler,2012-04-26 20:35:00,8605,"  You are correct sir. I was in Albert's bass boat with my son when you were pulling out.  As far as the trib in question goes, I rarely fish it anymore myself, in fact I kind of despise it...but I've never had to endure crowds when I do fish it.  You'd be surprised what effect 20 mins of walking has on the number of people.  It's still a fun place to fish when everything else is marginal or with beginners. Always lots of fish."
690388,Christopheraaron,2012-04-26 20:37:00,3525,WOW! some of those rivers looked almost BC worthy! Looks like a great time.
690389,I'mHooked,2012-04-26 20:39:00,525,"Definitely a good time fishing together, whether we had a 'successful' day or not. That's ok, no affidavit needed...this time. We'll just have to replicate the outing to be sure there's some evidence next time!    Afterall, landing my largest Steelie & close to largest smallmouth doesn't happen everyday for this armchair fisher!  Brendan sure looks like he enjoys his time with his old man!  Looking forward to the Algonquin report next week. (Don't forget your camera    )"
690391,misfish,2012-04-26 20:46:00,29133,"I meant to ask Mike,,,  Is that Dale Jr????????????  "
690392,solopaddler,2012-04-26 20:53:00,8605, We'll get out again next fall for sure Craig!     Dale Jr? Have no idea who that is.   That's Fidel.
690394,DRIFTER_016,2012-04-26 20:55:00,10439, Dale Jr.= Dale Earnhart Jr. son of Dale Earnhart Sr. one of the best stock car racers there ever was. Hide under a rock much?     :rofl2:
690395,TDunn,2012-04-26 21:02:00,680,Some really nice pictures Mike! Thanks for posting   TDunn
690397,solopaddler,2012-04-26 21:04:00,8605,"  Ah that explains it, I'm not a fan of the sport. Watching grass grow or maybe even paint dry is far more entertaining.  And btw the dufussy looking satin shirt with the patches all over it doesn't improve my perception of this so called great driver.  I get my fill of that kind of thing on the QEW everyday. There's enough A Types zipping around everyone like angry hornets for a lifetime of race watching.  When I do happen to stumble upon a race when I'm channel surfing I just end up with a mild case of road rage.   I do enjoy a good hockey game though. Last nights game was SPECTACULAR!"
690398,esoxansteel,2012-04-26 21:10:00,1307,"Common Mike help get the ratings up, watch Nascar, great looking photos as always, we will have to hook up for a fish in the fall  steve   I know Jeff Gordon, and Dale Jr. would win if they knew you were watching, and maybe Jimmi Johson and cheatin Chad would quit cheatin."
690399,misfish,2012-04-26 21:10:00,29133,"Thanks Dave. Zoey can attest to Mikes comment. She dont like him either.  Shame,I like Zoey."
690404,solopaddler,2012-04-26 21:24:00,8605, I like the idea of getting together in the fall. I don't think Nascar needs me to help boost their ratings though. LOL!      HAHAHAHA! I forgot about that.  I trained my dog to attack on sight when she sees anything Nascar related LOL!
690406,asdve23rveavwa,2012-04-26 21:35:00,2690,"  That would be great Mike, haven't hit the rivers much the last six or seven years."
690407,misfish,2012-04-26 21:46:00,29133,"   My brain is back tracking,,,,,,,,,,,,,,I do believe,,,Yep,I do believe, I asked this question before. Oh it must be the,getting older thing.Or watching Grumpy ole men to much."
690416,solopaddler,2012-04-26 22:20:00,8605, I can relate. I'm morphing more and more into Walter Matthau every day.
690418,Roy,2012-04-26 22:30:00,13728,So who am I? Jack Lemmon?
690419,Roy,2012-04-26 22:33:00,13728,Nahhhhh I must be Burgess Meredith.
