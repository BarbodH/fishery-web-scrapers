690763,Joeytier,2012-04-28 00:08:00,3990,Are you sure?? LOL!  The braid I use sure doesn't
690773,lovetofish,2012-04-28 00:45:00,500,"I love to fish, but I'm not really sure I'm good enough for that.  My fishing knowledge is too spread out, but if I ever won the lottery... I would definitely want to open a fishing camp or charter."
690775,Christopheraaron,2012-04-28 00:49:00,3525,"Don't doubt yourself, if your more knowledgable than the customer, you can take them to a few secret spots and are a friendly person I'm sure you'd be great!"

690783,lovetofish,2012-04-28 01:01:00,500,"Its really not that hard to find a job as a mechanic.  I've had 5 interviews this week and have one job offer and waiting to hear from one more place. The only problem is they don't want me to start until the last week of may.  I'm already on unemployment for sick benefits because of my stomach ulcer.  Finally feeling good, might not mind waiting until the last week of may.  This Saturday is trout opener, next saturday pike opens on lake Ontario and then walley opener the following weekend"
690784,lovetofish,2012-04-28 01:03:00,500,Starting your own place is expensive and you have to have a customer base setup already to be safe. I don't have these things.  I did go for an interview at CAA and they have great benefits and pension.  So hopefully I can get in there!
690788,lovetofish,2012-04-28 01:19:00,500,Walked along the don river today off of Bathurst.  Any fish in there?  Didn't see anything.?
690792,Christopheraaron,2012-04-28 01:27:00,3525,"There are a few steelhead, and salmon that run in there, carp and suckers also present."
690795,Joeytier,2012-04-28 01:33:00,3990,Didn't know the Don river crossed Bathurst...
690800,lovetofish,2012-04-28 01:44:00,500,"Looks like a good spot to practice my new setup!  Found a cheap float real in my garage (I got it when my Grandpa passed, he bought it at winners),took the clicker out, so it free wheels.  I have been using a spinning reel on my 10'6"" medium-light action rod.  I spooled the fly reel up with 50yds of backing, a lot of 30lbs mono, followed by 12lbs braid and then 5lbs fluoro.  Very interested to see how it works."
690802,lovetofish,2012-04-28 01:52:00,500," Not 100% sure, so I looked on google earth and the street beside it is called Don River Blvd."
690809,lovetofish,2012-04-28 02:03:00,500,  Sounds like you know this area very well! Do you still fish any of these areas?  We should hook up.
690811,lovetofish,2012-04-28 02:10:00,500,"Sorry, lots of questions.    Richmond Hill fisher which one would you go to the don or the humber?"
690846,Christopheraaron,2012-04-28 10:10:00,3525,"I don't know the areas too well before this forum I would do 5 hours of general fishing research a night, I like questions so keep them coming, I would fish the don I think, many people will disagree but I think that 1 there are less anglers 2 more access with walking trails, and 3 it's calmer. I'm all up for meeting up, maybe in the next few weekends sometime."
690876,lovetofish,2012-04-28 13:15:00,500,"I would rather find one unspooked fish, then a whole school of spooked fish. Less fishing pressure is only going to help that!"
690892,Christopheraaron,2012-04-28 15:08:00,3525,You've got that right!
690525,lovetofish,2012-04-27 12:22:00,500,"I have recently got laid off and live near Jane and Sheppard.  The Humber river runs very close by and I know the season opens on Saturday.  Is there any fish to be had or should I go to the mouth of the humber?  I've always wondered, but never really had time to check it out.  Guess I do now.  Thanks guys.   Lovetofish  Ps.  I have a baitcast reel and I was going to try float fishing with it.  Anyone ever try it?"
690527,Christopheraaron,2012-04-27 12:29:00,3525," Bring noseplugs! seriously it smells awful down there, might be better off chasing browns upstream."
690528,lovetofish,2012-04-27 12:30:00,500,"I currently have 20lbs fluorocarbon on it because I was using it for trolling for walley.  I'm guessing that is too heavy, so i was debating weather or not to put braid or mono?  I know braid is way more sensitive and I would have to use a fluoro leader. Any thoughts?"
690529,lovetofish,2012-04-27 12:32:00,500,Upstream from me? How far?  Thanks
690530,lovetofish,2012-04-27 12:34:00,500,I didn't realize that it splits further north too.
690531,Christopheraaron,2012-04-27 12:39:00,3525,"Humber is a very long system it continues all the way to holland marsh, if you want to stay close to home try to just go up a little, the bows are still up."
690533,Christopheraaron,2012-04-27 12:40:00,3525,I'm guessing you'll start to get a few resident browns when you hit klienburg.
690534,lovetofish,2012-04-27 12:40:00,500,"It doen't open until saturday, right?"
690536,Christopheraaron,2012-04-27 12:42:00,3525,"under eglinton it's open all year but above that yes, this saturday."
690538,lovetofish,2012-04-27 12:44:00,500,Thanks for ur help.
690540,lovetofish,2012-04-27 12:46:00,500,Do the salmon get up this far in late summer?
690542,lovetofish,2012-04-27 12:48:00,500,Do u know if u can fish in Claireville Conservation area?
690578,manitoubass2,2012-04-27 14:55:00,11391,"I've never fished these species,  But if your float fishing with a baitcaster I'd use braid with a fluoro leader the length of the depth your want to achieve.  Braid floats, fluoro sinks like a rock.  Check out the MNR website or pick up a copy of the regs for the rest of your questions  http://viewer.zmags....8a2#/29e578a2/1  The actual books are available at baitshops, your local MNR offices, local convenience stores (in some cases)  Best of luck to you!!!"
690579,lovetofish,2012-04-27 15:03:00,500,"  Thanks for your help. The link you posted was much better then the one i was using.  http://www.mnr.gov.on.ca/en/Business/LetsFish/Publication/STEL02_163615.html  What pound test would you run for the braid and the fluoro?  Thanks,  Lovetofish"
690604,manitoubass2,2012-04-27 16:18:00,11391," No problem, glad to help! But like previously mentioned, I never get to target those fish. Might wanna get some of the other to chime in for recommendations???  Depends on your set up etc I suppose, but I'd think it would depend where your fishing and the depth.  The heavier the braid, the more it floats. But the lighter the braid the better the fight will be.  I'd think 6-8lb braid would be good, and match the diameter up with the fluoro  With the smaller braid you can get great casts, and you could also use a hi vis to help as well.  Again, the fluoro leader would depend on what depth you wish to present your offerings   "
690614,chuckymcd,2012-04-27 16:45:00,144,"  Not to sure on the braid, maybe a 10 or 15 lbs, and around a 4 or 5 pound flouro.  try throwing some spinners as well if you find it hard to float fish with a bait caster  Tight Lines"
690619,Christopheraaron,2012-04-27 17:03:00,3525,"I'm sure that there are fish in clareville, probably bass and pike from what I can see from the highway. I intend to fish it once bass opens. And the salmon will probably ge up that way by fall, yes. Right now you can entertain yourself with suckers up there!"
690621,rhymobot,2012-04-27 17:18:00,174," Claireville I checked out last August just to have a look. Only the wide part not the creek. I entered through wild water kingdom gate and said i'm going to the water not the park and they had no problem with that. followed the path through to where the water is under Steeles. parked there and through a couple lures for the hell of it. under this bridge it kinda looks like skid row but no one else was there and it was about 6pm on a weekday.  as for upstream NW of of 50 and Steeles there's that path where i believe you can park and hike into the nature and eventually reach the creek. i seem to remember parking there once when i was young but not for fishing. there was an arm gate blocking further access but we parked in front the of the gate and wandered in.  and i've seen people fishing it on the east side of indian line by the dam when i drove by on the 427. not sure how they got access. i guess they could have taken indian line from ablion road access and parked along the road. the campground itself has a gate attendant but i asked her last year if i could drive in and have a look around and she said go ahead. i thought it was kinda bizarre to wanna stay in a campground beside a brown river you can't swim in surrounded by trains, planes, and automobiles. and there were tonnes of people and their campers there at that time.  and like the other guy said, i've read there is bass and pike in there but mostly it's bottom feeders. suckers, carp, small cats. they have an annual fishing day there for families in the reservoir."

690672,Christopheraaron,2012-04-27 19:45:00,3525, I think he fishes.
690699,snowdown,2012-04-27 20:49:00,24,  Fishing guide may be good for him.
690734,lovetofish,2012-04-27 22:48:00,500,"Would love to be a guide! Ah yes, one can dream. I'm an Automotive Service Technician"
690761,Christopheraaron,2012-04-28 00:06:00,3525,"Why don't you be a guide? Your title is almost a guide, why don't you live it? You could do it part time until it gets running smoothly."
