690660,kickingfrog,2012-04-27 19:24:00,8333,"I'm not clear on what you are asking when you say ""terrestrial flies"". Do you mean flies used for fishing? Or diptera specifically?  Or flies/bugs in general that do not spend part of their life cycle in the water ?  Most that I can think of do float. Although it might be more accurate to say they are not heavy or strong enough to break through the surface tension of the water."
690665,bushart,2012-04-27 19:32:00,2628,I was wondering about the flies used for fishing??  I know they have leach patterns and such---but the ones they call terrestrial---I was wondering if they're all dry or do some sink as well  Thks
690666,cuzza,2012-04-27 19:36:00,467,"Terrestrials are generally hoppers, ants, that sort of thing and yeah, the artificials are always floating/dry patterns.  'Wet' fly patterns tend to be baitfish, leeches, nymphs - stuff that belongs in the water."
