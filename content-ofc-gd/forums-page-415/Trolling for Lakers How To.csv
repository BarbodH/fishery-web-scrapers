658706,BillM,2012-01-21 05:07:00,17367,"If you want trout, drive to the Salmon River, hire a guide and catch steelhead until your heart's content."
658714,Dontcryformejanhrdina,2012-01-21 05:25:00,535,"  On the fly? I'm not sure I have the patience for it. I like to power the fish in, probably why I like musky fishing so much. Hell, I even use 50lb braid for bass/walleye fishing. It would go against my instinct to fly fish, I think I would lose so many fish I'd end up getting too frustrated with it."
658716,TDunn,2012-01-21 05:52:00,680,"  Knuguy, When I am trolling for inland lakers from my kayak/canoe, I am usually moving with just enough speed to see my rod tip thumping from the action. This is typically anywhere from .5-1.5 mph. A 3 way swivel with a dropper line to a 2-3 oz bell sinker will get you down to pretty much any depth at that speed. I can smack bottom no problem in 60-70 feet without a ton of line out. For a lure my favourite would have to be a giant single blade harness. I love gang trolls but can't stand the resistance when fighting a fish. Cut one up and tie up a few single blade spinner rigs. Slow roll a 4"" gulp smelt minnow or an actual smelt/large shiner behind the blade. This can be just as effective as a gang troll yet you don't have even close to the same resistance. This is an awesome setup for light tackle. I run this rig off a Gander Mountain 7ft MH eglass crankbait rod and an Abu Garcia Ambassadeur baitcaster with 10-12 pound test.  It's fun when you can actually fight the fish! Always let this rig out slow (tight) or else you are going to tangle before you even get down.  You can see the 3 way in this pic. A small gang troll is hooked up to it.   Hope this helps!   TDunn"
658796,BillM,2012-01-21 17:46:00,17367," Nah, a long spinning setup would work just fine out there.  No need to get fancy with anything."
659020,Dontcryformejanhrdina,2012-01-22 04:27:00,535,I might have to give that a try then in the future.   In the meantime I might focus on Bay Lake since it's so small. Hopefully I'll be able to figure out a pattern and catch a couple this Spring.
659021,danc,2012-01-22 04:33:00,4677,"Flat lining for Lakers is lots of fun. There's no need for a complicated 3 way setup. Buy a few 1 oz, bead chain sinkers, throw out a spoon, and enjoy the cruise. Simple as that."
659086,TDunn,2012-01-22 16:20:00,680,  Yup flatlining is great! but a 3 way is not complicated...  TDunn
659097,SirCranksalot,2012-01-22 16:55:00,3291,"Thx very much, TD. That gives me some ideas for next summer and maybe late spring. I have gone out on Lake O. on a friends boat using big cannonballs foe salmon. It's OK fun, but not the same as w/o all that weight."
659099,BillM,2012-01-22 17:04:00,17367,"  If you want lakers, the mouth of the Niagara has an unlimited number of them"
659111,4x4bassin,2012-01-22 17:38:00,1025,"Like others have said , no need for riggers in the spring. The lake trout will be in the upper water column (50F-55F water temp. is key)so really all you need is a deep diving minnow bait like a Rapala Tail Dancer or something like that and let out ""alot"" of line because the lakers will scatter once the boat goes by but almost always come back  . I use to go with the heavy inline trolling weights and spoons but found that there was no need for this setup in the spring.If you do go with the inline weight system I wouldn't go any heavier than 1oz. and a flashy williams (Trophy 2 has been good for me,lots of flash/wobble)and troll real slowwwww for both setups.Remember lake trout almost always feed above them so dragging a spoon under them in deep water reduces your chances of hooking up ! Once the surface temps. start exceeding past 65F (June in central Ontario) then the lakers start moving deeper and that is when you start with the heavier weights or riggers and a good finder will help alot at this time of year as well to find the deep holes in a lake , the lake trout will almost always be in that deep basin or around it come early summer and into late summer. Believe it or not but I have had my best laker fishing in late August when the fish are schooled up on the ledges and deep basins and I was able to find them on the lowrance and send down a heavy bucktail jig (1oz) and catch them in 50-100 feet of water, that my friend is fun and the way to do it but can be difficult/frustrating until you get the hang of it. Good luck with the trolling and thanks alot for getting the spring lake trout fever going so soon , I love catching those fish !"
659152,SirCranksalot,2012-01-22 19:05:00,3291,"  Might be a tad tricky in a canoe, though!"
659156,BillM,2012-01-22 19:12:00,17367, Just a wee bit!  lol
659335,Dontcryformejanhrdina,2012-01-23 06:33:00,535,Thanks a lot everybody!   I'm relieved to know I can forget about using the downriggers for now. Hopefully I can stumble across some trout this Spring!
659384,Ainsley,2012-01-23 13:54:00,142,I've never had luck with lakers on baptiste
659385,Ainsley,2012-01-23 13:55:00,142,"I've never had luck with lakers on baptiste, I've fished that lake every year since I was a kid."
690581,Dontcryformejanhrdina,2012-04-27 15:03:00,535,"Thanks for all the tips guys! I was able to catch my first 2 lakers a couple of weeks back and I'm going to give it another try Monday. I caught them bouncing bottom in 20-30' of water using leadcore with just spoons, slowly pulling the rod back and forth while trolling. They weren't very big, but it's a start!"
690587,Sinker,2012-04-27 15:28:00,8692,"We did well two weeks ago on rapala tail dancers in size 7 and 9 flatlined back 100-150ft. I just use a medium spinning set up with 15lb braid to an 8lb fluoro leader. I find the smaller, less fished lakes are better for lakers.  Vary your speed. Some days they want it dead slow, others they want it hauling ass!  S."
690592,Dontcryformejanhrdina,2012-04-27 15:45:00,535,"  I've considered using tail dancers but I wasn't sure how effective they'd be going so slow. Nice to know they'll work, I'll have to give them a try.   I was fishing in a small lake too, much easier to find them."
690595,Sinker,2012-04-27 15:48:00,8692,"We got most of ours trolling right around 2mph. I always troll a good spot several times, at different speeds/depths. Sometimes you will get them at any speed/depth. The key is to keep your presentation above them. If they want it, they will get it!  S."
658492,Dontcryformejanhrdina,2012-01-20 18:04:00,535,"Well, it's winter, I'm still waiting for my fishing licence to come in the mail so ice fishing isn't a possibility for me yet. I'm trying to do my homework in the meantime and learn some new fishing techniques. I bought a boat this past fall that came with downriggers and downrigging rods, balls, etc... but I've never tried fishing for lakers (or any kind of trout). I'd like to start fishing for them as soon as the water opens back up but I have no idea where to start. I know lake trout love deep water, but that's about it.  Does anybody have any tips on what lures to use, what speed to troll at, general depths to focus on? How much line should I have out behind the boat/down rigger ball? I'm up around Bancroft quite a bit on my days off so I might try Paudash, Baptiste and Bay Lake since I've heard they have lakers. It'll be interesting trolling around deep water since I'm not used to focusing my efforts in those areas. At the very least I can enjoy a relaxing cruise around the lake, right?  Any info would be greatly appreciated, thanks."
658493,Raf,2012-01-20 18:12:00,3495,"From ice-out till early June, you will not need your riggers.  The active fish will be up high in the water column and can be caught long lining minnowbaits, spoons, spinners, etc.  We catch them in less than 40' of water, sometimes less than 20.  Planer boards can be a useful tool speading your baits out.  Speeds are kept slow.. 1.5mph-2.5mph  That's not to say you wont catch any deep.  Once water temps get above 60, someone else can give you downrigging tips."
658496,Gregoire,2012-01-20 18:25:00,1397,"I agree with the ice out advice. Later in the season try troling deep deep wholes of the lake. I would put the riggers down 40 and 60 feet to satrt trolling flashers and spoons. If you are marking fish but not hooking up swith colours up, or try running meat or jointed rapalas."
658497,Dontcryformejanhrdina,2012-01-20 18:29:00,535,Is a Rapala tail dancer a good lure for Lakers? should I be running the baits 80-100' behind the boat?
658499,BillM,2012-01-20 18:41:00,17367,"Biggest thing with lakers is finding the thermocline..  You want a water temp of between 48-52..  they'll be patrolling just above it.  Early season is the easiest, top 15ft of the water column...   Lake trout are notorious followers, they'll follow lures for miles if you let them.  Make sure you speed up, slow down, zig-zag, whatever to get them to bite."
658502,Roy,2012-01-20 18:58:00,13728," Dang, and I thought they'd be below it or at least near it and come up just to feed. Guess I'm wrong. Differing speeds really is the way to go though. I kinda like Thinfish and Williams Trophy II although spring of last season I was getting them on any long, thin crankbaits about 10' to 17' down.... at 2mph or so."
658505,BillM,2012-01-20 19:09:00,17367,"Roy, that's what I've read so who really knows    My best bait for them has been a silver/blue with orange belly husky jerk!  (The big one)"
658507,Raf,2012-01-20 19:12:00,3495,"spring is a different ball game as the thermocline is not established.  the temps are more uniform throughout than in the summer and the fish can be found at all depths.  the active ones may be shallower but if you don't get biters, take out the dipsys and try a little deeper.  if that doesn't work, get the riggers out and go deeper still.  they can be anywhere in the spring."
658509,wallacio,2012-01-20 19:19:00,475,"Roy is correct...in the summer, Lakers will generally be found relating to bottom or just under the thermocline (and sometimes anywhere inbetween).  A buddy and I fish up at the cottage in Muskoka with riggers and hands-down, our best producing lure a small Williams Wobbler in the hammered gold finish.    We usually run one rigger as close to bottom as possible and the other just under the thermocline about 20' behind the balls and we do quite well."
658510,Roy,2012-01-20 19:20:00,13728,That makes sense Raf.
658511,Lip-ripper,2012-01-20 19:22:00,228,"We hammer them usually in 75-95 FOW or deeper. Sometimes right on or near bottom in over 100 FOW flatlining with 3 oz bottom walkers.  If you are going to downrig, keep an eye on your depth and never let the ball come too close to bottom. If you are running them at 80 feet for example, as soon as the depth starts coming up near 85-90 feet, get ready to crank up your riggers a few feet to stay ahead of it. You don't want them bouncing off bottom or getting hung up.  Lures will vary depending on water clarity. I tend to use shinier lures in clearer water, with colours being used in murkier situations. I'll run around 8-10 feet of line behind the ball. If you leave to much, the lure will sink if you have to make a sharp turn, and could get hung up.  You can also run gang-trolls or flashers attached to the ball, and use a 2 way release a few feet up the line that holds your lure above it."
658512,DanD,2012-01-20 19:28:00,2223,"I would try and hook up with someone that has done some rigging and go out with them or you take them out in your boat. Once the basics are learnt; it’ll be like any other type of fishing and you’ll put your own twist on things. This next bit is just a safety caution while rigging. But when you start buying spoons, releases and other rigging equipment; I would suggest the first thing in the boat, should be a good pair of cable cutters. Something that you know will cut the cannon ball cable with ease and is always right there handy. Trolling at 1-3 miles an hour, cannon ball down 60-70 feet and the ball gets snagged on something; you don’t have a lot of time to fool around before the rigger gets ripped off the side of the boat or possibly sinks you. There is a cable spool drag setting on the rigger but if you’re at the end of your cable and are still moving, cut the cable. Cannon balls & replacement cables are cheep compared to the alternative. The guy that taught me was maybe (no he was) a bit paranoid but he had a pair of side cutters bungee cord tied to the riggers; that’s so there never was any doubt where they were. But it’ll scare the crap out of you trolling along and all of a sudden there a 40 foot high shoal that comes out of nowhere and the cannon ball is 10 or 20 feet below its ridge. Believe me you’ll be all thumbs, while trying to reach for the motor, rigger up switch and the side cutters all at the same time; not knowing which one first; when in doubt cut the cable.  Dan."
658514,Grimace,2012-01-20 19:30:00,2020,If you are fishing for them in Lake Ontario do not be afraid to dust the bottom with them.  It is known to churn up some action.   Never ever EVER try that in Muskoka.  Lol.  It will be over before it starts.  Keep your brake on the downriggers enough to hold the ball but loose enough to give line if the unthinkable happens.
658516,Harrison,2012-01-20 19:32:00,2202,"Can't help you with sheild lakes, but I could fill your ear if you asked about lake O riggin for lakers.  I will say my number one go to for lakers out there is a Flutterchuck.  Green/metal is hands down a Laker Taker.  Good luck."
658517,BillM,2012-01-20 19:33:00,17367,Simcoe is another place where I've heard guys have good success stirring up the bottom.  Going to put some time in on that lake this year for bass and lakers.
658570,TDunn,2012-01-20 22:42:00,680,"Ive nailed them in 60-80 ft of water at ice out....on bottom.... I use downriggers alot but in my kayak I do just aswell with a 3 way.  If your fishing inland, I recommended using some sort of meat (smelt, shiner, dace) and slow rolling it behind a blade or spoon. Its all about the slow roll! 4"" gulp is amazing on lakers too!  TDunn"
658580,SirCranksalot,2012-01-20 23:46:00,3291,"TD,  I often fish from a canoe. I don't know much about downriggers. I thought they were those heavy cannon ball things that folks use on bigger boats on Lake O etc . I have trouble visualizing how you would use that in a kayak.  I'd be very interested to hear more details re your e-way swivel setup. Don't you still need quite a heavy sinker to get down deep, depending on the speed of course."
658581,Dontcryformejanhrdina,2012-01-20 23:59:00,535," I remember you telling me that when you sold me your boat. This REALLY worries me (especially fishing a lake like Baptiste that has deep water but also has a lot of logs in parts of it). I have wire and hook cutters in my boat since I'm into musky fishing but I don't want to be in that situation lol. A friend of a friend does a lot of downrigging for Lakers in that area so I'm going to try to get him to go with me sometime. It would be great if I didn't have to even use the downriggers at first until I got more used to the lakes, know where/where not to go. Once June rolls around anyway I'll be focusing on musky more than anything, anyway.  As for fishing Lake Ontario, it's not that far but a water that size worries me since my boat isn't huge by any means (16' aluminum with a 40hp tiller) and I wouldn't even know where to start. I'd rather start with smaller lakes I'm a little more familiar with. I'm not looking for trophy fish, just something to keep me busy until everything else opens in May/June. The way I look at it is it'll be nice just taking the boat out again. Any fish I might catch would just be a bonus but I don't expect to catch any lol."
658585,Gregoire,2012-01-21 00:32:00,1397,"It may surprise you but locating fish on the troll in lake Ontario may be easier than locating them on a shield lake. However I would be hesitant to take a 16""er out there."
658588,BillM,2012-01-21 00:45:00,17367,"A 16' tiller is fine out on Lake O, just watch the wind and pick your days carefully.   That's all we ever fished out of when I was a kid, 16ft Smokercraft with a 25hp 2 stroke Johnson..  Never an issue."
658601,John Bacon,2012-01-21 01:05:00,3277," Remember, Baptiste has slot limits and a shorter season... remember to check exeptions to the regs. Baptiste does not have a great number of lakers."
658608,dave524,2012-01-21 01:30:00,4508," Ditto, fished Haliburton lakers for a lot of years when my dad had a place there. Hands down the most effective rig off a rigger was a large Luhr Jensen "" Dave Davis "" gang troll with meat out the back. Get a baiting needle and a few dace or chubs, about 5 or 6 inchers, take 2 foot or so of 15 or 20 pound leader material with a good sized treble on the end, insert the needle just forward of the baits tail and out the mouth, draw the line so the hook is about flush with the tip of the tail, then the line out the mouth go down from the top of the mouth and out the bottom keeping the mouth closed, now adust so there is a slight bend in the body and when trolled will have a rolling action, tie to the back of the troll with a good swivel. We always had better luck on suspended fish just under the thermocline rather than the ones hanging out near bottom."
658622,Pangle,2012-01-21 02:05:00,64,"    I have a 17ft, 40hp tiller that i use on lake O all the time.  Like Bill said, pick your days.  At first light it can be like glass.  I usually go from 6-10am. I never target lakers so i can't help you there but salmon and rainbows are relatively simple to catch. Spoons, flasher/fly, dipsy's, meat and line counter reel is all you need. PM me if you like.  There's nothing like a 30lb chinny!"
658690,Gregoire,2012-01-21 04:37:00,1397,Just my personal opinion. I got out last summer in a few good storms and can't imagine what that would have been like in a smaller boat but when it's smooth and there are no weather systems coming in it would not be a problem.
658705,Dontcryformejanhrdina,2012-01-21 05:05:00,535,"  Good to know. I haven't really looked closely at any regs yet. I haven't had any lucky in Baptiste lately anyway, for any species.   Do people ever fish the Bay of Quinte for trout? All I ever hear about here is walleye. Lake Ontario for Salmon is definetely something I'd like to do in the future but I think I'd rather go with a guide/somebody who knows what they're doing, first. Some of the stuff you guys are talking about I have no idea what it is lol I think I'd be better off seeing what it is and how you use it.  I'm pretty lucky I'm less than an hour drive from a zone where pike is open all year. I guess I could start fishing for carp too for their fighting ability but to be honest I don't think I'd want to touch the filthy things haha. I've just always wanted to fish for trout so it makes sense to give it a try when nothing else is open."
