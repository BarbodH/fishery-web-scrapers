Other than the 200+ dollar Navionics Great Lakes chip, what microSDchips can I buy for my elite5 (lowrance) unit that show the canadian waters of Detroit River and St. Clair. I have an SD Lakemaster Michigan chip that is great for my Lowrance LMS at my console but I need a microSD chip for my bow unit that is a microSD. Lakemaster only does Humminbird chips now and the Lakemaster Michigan Lowrance chips are sold out everywhere!!! Was wondering if the Fishing Hotspots chips covered only the states side of Detroit and St. Clair cause they are 100$???? Thanks Landry"
