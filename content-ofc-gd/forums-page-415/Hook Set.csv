690285,NAW,2012-04-26 12:19:00,4022,I'm not sure you will be able to see this video.  First time trying to post a video from Photobucket.  I'm pretty sure he/she is practicing hook sets in there!!!  A short video from my 20 week ultra sound on Tuesday.  Does anyone know how to insert a video from photobucket so it doesn't link people to my account?
690288,woodenboater,2012-04-26 12:38:00,2277,"congratulations Nick !  While it could be a hook set, I thought he/she was working on their double haul. elbows looked alright and decent form for a 20 week old"
690303,Pikeslayer,2012-04-26 13:34:00,1443," Nick, You can have multiple 'albums' on PB within your account. Sign in, click on 'Albums', then 'Create new album'. You can then set privacy settings accordingly- public/private/password protected. I use my 'public' album for posting photos here. Everything else is in seperate private albums. Family photos are kept in a password protected album so they can visit anytime. Hope this helps.  Simon"
690305,NAW,2012-04-26 13:37:00,4022," Thanks Simon.  That's what I ended up doing.  I set all my other albums to private.  Just wondering if there's a way to embed a video, just like you can do with U Tube."
690306,Pikeslayer,2012-04-26 13:41:00,1443,"Nick, I tried to embed like youtube but just get a screen grab that links to the PB video.  BTW, you might want to edit the video to get rid of personal information.  Healthy looking baby by the way. Congrats."
690307,John,2012-04-26 13:45:00,2956,"Congrat's Nick, sure looks like a strong hook set to me!"
690320,NAW,2012-04-26 14:51:00,4022,"I removed the video of the little gaffer practicing hook set because I couldn't figure out how to edit out the personal info.  Here's a few pics though.     This is one of may fav's.  That's the front of the face, peacking out from the shadows. "
690328,mercman,2012-04-26 15:16:00,7054,"Didnt see the video, but by the sound of the comments, Congrats are in order!!!  You know what they say, if it looks like a hook set, then thats what it is!!!"
690378,misfish,2012-04-26 20:05:00,29133,"3D,S are cool eh Nick.  Thanks for shaing."
