689377,danz,2012-04-22 22:18:00,15,"the 2nd edition (1999),  Anyone know where I can buy this book? I am havig a hard time finding a reliable source for it.  "
689385,Roy,2012-04-22 22:34:00,13728,Walk into any Indigo books and buy it...are they reliable enough for you?
689397,chris.brock,2012-04-22 23:25:00,4053,"they have them at Lebarons, in stock on a shelf, at the Mississauga store"
689466,adempsey,2012-04-23 03:22:00,1498,"Bought my copy at LeBarons a few years back.  I'd be surprised if you could find a copy in a Chapters or Indigo store.   If you can't find it at LeBaron's, you'll probably have to order a used copy from Chapters or Amazon."
689468,irishfield,2012-04-23 03:35:00,26272,"""Used and Rare"" $46.63 on Indigo or you can buy from Canadian Book Depot for $69.95. A book that sold originally for $16.95. I'd just ask Solo where ""I"" should go first for free!  Ebay  .. $50 + $17 shipping.  http://www.ebay.ca/itm/Northern-Ontario-Fishing-Guide-Hines-Herringer-Jensen-/160656490176  Don't see it in Lebaron's catalogue anymore."
689470,Roy,2012-04-23 03:35:00,13728," Wow, sorry you're absolutely correct....just checked everywhere. The only place I found was the Canadian Book Depot http://www.canadianbookdepot.com/servlet/the-5210/Northern-Ontario-Fishing-Guide/Detail ... expensive but they seem to have one in stock."
689471,irishfield,2012-04-23 03:36:00,26272,Indigo has it Roy.. used and rare..
689489,woodenboater,2012-04-23 11:47:00,2277,"I'd give Open Air books in Toronto a try. They're a gold mine for niche books and they had a really nice selection on fishing last time I was there and even better on paddling. Adelaide St. East and Toronto St., downtown.  and if there's one there, grab me a copy please"
689678,danz,2012-04-24 00:05:00,15,"Indigo and amazon both point to a used place called quo pro or something that has got bad reviews from international buyers.  So I am trying to avoid that route.  I heard lebarons had them, but not in the catalogue.  I live in caledonia but maybe I can swing by there on the weekend.  I just don't know how this has become so rare? I hate to sPend 69 bucks on the thing when I only want info on one lake out of it too! Thank you for all the replies fellas!"
689679,danz,2012-04-24 00:06:00,15,"Certainly reliable, just don't have it. "
689682,solopaddler,2012-04-24 00:16:00,8605,  Dan I'm just down the road from you (Garth & Twenty area).  I'll trade you my copy for a small bottle of Bailey's.  I'll even throw in a copy of their trout/salmon guide.
689688,i2cool2fool,2012-04-24 00:36:00,349, Hard to beat that deal!
689995,danz,2012-04-25 01:37:00,15,Pm'd!!
