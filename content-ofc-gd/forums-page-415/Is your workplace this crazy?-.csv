Here's the toll free number -  1-877-202-0008 Everyone is concerned that if they make too much noise about health and safety companies will close. This is a threat that corporations hold over our heads all the time. Look what happened in London at Caterpillar. They tried to squeeze more and more out of those workers and they eventually left anyway. These managers are nothing but goons. I look at Holmes foundry in Sarnia where workers were exposed to asbestos, now those workers and their families have to live with the devastating health effects of mesothelioma. I've met too many families who lost loved ones to occupational disease. I have a close friend whose husband died at 36 because of asbestos exposure. Don't let your safety reps off the hook either, if you belong to a union and your local reps aren't doing their job, go to your national union.

Personally no job is worth knowingly getting injured at or possibly dieing for. A decision needs to be made by each the employees either force a change as a group or get picked off one by one both have the same down side only one has the advantage of change. Grumbling with no action is counter productive it makes you feel like you are doing something without good results. Take the # Rolly has posted and pass it out  if there are enough calls they will send in a team and find out whether this is a ""whinefest"" or an unsafe place to work.   Art"

The company seized the opportunity to rid themselves of these guys when they felt they had justifiable reasons to do so. I wouldn't be surprised if this same company has gone out of their way or are sympathetic to employees that put in a good day's work and are assets to the company despite injuries, addictions or other personal issues. Workers rights and safety regulations are often taken advantage of by the slackers and they can dig their own graves. Companies are often handcuffed by labour standards or bargaining agreements to effectively do anything about it; it seems they found enough cause in these three cases. For 18 years I worked for a company that would take a bullet for some employees and would leave others to twist in the wind. I always felt they had my back unless I gave them a damn good reason not to."

Ryan Award for Safety from the Canadian Institute of Mining, Metallurgy and Petroleum as 'the safest coal mine in Canada in 1991.' Just 11 days later, on the morning of May 9, 1992 -- only nine months after opening -- the Westray mine exploded.

I firmly believe he'd be with us today had the company not been shopping roof repair quotes for months on end.  We've all worked with people that abuse the protections in place to suit their agenda and for employers that are willing to spend a dollar to save a dime. Its not a perfect world and my comments were just an insight to the three accounts laid out by the original poster.

In the later years things went down hill because of management, and things got bad. It's bad when the workers thought more about the place than management. I for one will admit there was a few bad apples that made us guys look bad, the legit ones that were hurting and still went crawling in to work day or night shift weather they could or not because we needed the money. I worked with, or should I say did their share of the work because they played the game, I called them fresh air thieves. Their the ones you talk about. When I retired I had the same feeling as Chris. Chris was one of the hardiest workers in his department, his job left him in the shape he is in today. He may not say anything but the man hurts. I'm good, but I see Chris's pain, every time I see him. I'm glad I can still jump in the boat any day I want.

The company Dr. interviews each guy based on the survey and he hones in on the major issues. Long story short...he phoned my specialist who told him I was OK. Now the issues have re-occured and I'm not sure what to do..Report it and I might be pushed out the door..not report it and I might get fired!!??...

An employee may have been traveling through the yard, struck an object or another employee and said a speck of dust obscured his vision on a windy day... or maybe he wasn't paying attention and used that as an excuse. The truth doesn't matter and we get to enjoy a new policy. In my line of work there are plenty of policies I have to roll my eyes about, some that I'm grateful for and a lot that I've ignored! I think a good team player is willing to bend a little to get the job done and a good company is willing to overlook the small stuff. To put some perspective on this, I've worked with numerous guys over the years that wouldn't pull a trailer if it had a marker light out. A service truck would have to be called in, the driver would collect his waiting time and the load would be delayed. To the letter of the law, he may be 'in the right' to refuse the assignment but all these incidents add up they find themselves out of work... ""getting screwed by the company"".

The employer was charged with 12 violations of the Occupational Health and Safety Act and was eventually fined $12,000. The employer could have been fined up to $500,000 for each violation if found guilty and each individual charged could be fined $25,000. The mother now has to raise those two boys on her own. I wonder if the Ministry of Labour Inspectors had been there the day before iof that young man would still be with us today. The trouble is we need more inspectors because too many employers aren't abiding by the minimum standards as required by the law.

689255,rmarentette,2012-04-22 15:57:00,124," The problem is, workers gave up the right to sue when we got the Compensation Act in 1914. She gets a survivors pension but that's small comfort when your spouse and daddy is killed on the job. Nobody should have to be maimed or die just to have a job. Compensation is difficult to get even when the evidence is clear and often injured workers just give up or go back to work before they're ready. Just because a claim is denied doesn't it make it false. Employers do everything they can to drag it out hoping that workers will give up. When workers can't get the compensation that they are entitled too they end up on welfare and Canada pension Disability and use OHIP and that costs every taxpayer. The employers are supposed to pay not the tax payers."

In the past, the company has tried too hard to appease employees and keep people happy so now when we try and enforce rules, its very very tough.  The rules are there for their own health and safety.  Accidents have all sorts of costs, first human costs, then of course monetary and other costs.  Our company has some large clients who have some of the most stringent safety policies out there.  They track our safety performance and if we dont make the cut, we loose out on contracts.  For some reason, employees fail to wait to understand this, some think they can do whatever they want.  Just recently, we have had to revisit a policy on face sheilds because a couple guys dont want to wear them.  The policy has been in force for over 2 years and came about due to a rash of eye injuries and rising WSIB claims and rates.  We have had people under the influence here too, it boggles my mind but nothing seems to surprise me anymore.  Its frustrating from the employers/managments point of view when you are trying to get work done in the face of rising costs and more stringent compliance issues.  I don't recall dealing with these kinds of things as often as few as 10 years ago but maybe Im lookig back with rose coloured glasses..."

What about the presciption pill popper that is considered legal, or the crack smoker who clears his blood after 3 days, or the high-functioning alcoholic who sobers up after 24 hrs. Oxy's are one of our biggest drug problems and the stupid things are legal.  The only problem I have with drug testing is that it targets people who are not necessarily the problem... pot smokers only end up being the scape goats. ""we got rid of our drug-adled employee who caused the accident"".  Other than the pot issue/drug testing, I have come to agree with the others on this topic who are siding with the employer."

Anyone can argue any point they like, but what it always comes down to is the court of law and who provided the most due diligence. Due Diligence is all an employer has to work with.  Say that worker who drank, smoked , popped pills or did any of the above kills someone, by no fault of their own... Do you honestly believe for a second that that dead workers family's newly hired lawyer is going to care whether it was last night or four nights ago he smoked dope. Fact is, you and everyone else is getting sued, and you are now instantly on the hook for 50K in lawyer fees just to stay in business. So is he less worthy of an operator, in this day and age, he might just be.  But I do hear you on the oxy issue and pot being a scape goat, I have spend 3 years of my life dealing with it in my house. I know all about it."
689813,Rod Caster,2012-04-24 14:25:00,5784,"  What I am saying is that they would not necessarily catch the crackhead, drinker or pill popper, but they would be able to hold the pot smoker liable and instantly he would be considered ""endangering the other workers"" while the others just  Sorry to hear about the Oxy thing....

My workers are all trained, but I'm responsible if someone takes a shortcut and screws up. I sometimes have a dozen or more workers that I'm in charge of. I can't possibly watch every move that each one of them makes. Getting the job done right and within budget takes up 99.9% of my time.

As far as drug testing.....anyone at our work place that had a commercial drivers license was subject to random testing....you never knew when you were going to be sent to pee in a cup....I was sent almost every time....later found out why....they need clean guys to look good....so they sent the guys they knew were clean day in and day out.....so every time I was sent I would take a little bit longer to return to work...  We had one guy that got hurt so much you wouldn't believe it...they nicknamed him ""Slip, Trip and Fall there goes my Back Dominiac"". He built a huge house from all his law suits...

If the second guy had an existing medical condition that he didn't divulge when asked to do so...he should expect to get fired.  He was perplexingly honest though...he could have claimed the problem was new, having been brought on by working for that company.  I can't stand people who pull stuff like the third guy...pretending to be hurt to get off work or get modified duty.  I'm not exactly infatuated with the company I work for, so it's not the notion of them getting screwed that upsets me...it's the idea of someone taking it easy while others pick up his slack that rubs me the wrong way.  I do wonder about the details a little though.  Just because you can ride a motorbike for a few minutes to pick up a loaf of bread, doesn't mean you can do 8-12 hours of repetitive and/or hard physical labour.

I was off work for all of 10 days  before I was allowed to come back, on light dities. I sorted mail in my station for 3 months, full hours, before THEIR doctor gave me the green light to come back, but reccommended I should be given a walk with less stairs, as my injury was permanent. To make a long story short, the heel injury I had, when walking under harsh conditions (snow, wet weather, high volume of mail) caused me to limp. I was warned by a chiropractor that the limping would eventually throw other things outta whack. Finally one morning my knee just 'popped,' and down I went! Right off the bat I was told I SHOULD NOT have even been delivering this walk . . . . .   but the Post Office backed off when I produced no less than 6 letters from me complaining about what walking this route (3914 stairs) was going to exacerbate my already injured heel. Fast forward another 2 years, the W. S. I. B. said I couldn't work as a letter carrier any more . . .    they found a job for me, inside, midnight shift, sorting mail, not my cuppa tea, but better than sitting at home! Unfortunately my limping had thoroughly wrecked my right knee . . . .   it was highly reccommended I have a complete knee replacement, or end up crippled . . . .  I chose knee replacement . . . .  waited over a year and finally got the surgery done. NOW, 5 months later, I can still hardly walk . . . . .  I'm going to have ANOTHER knee operation, which might fix it . . .  it might not too. But the moral of this sad tale . . . . .    you can bet your chubby l'il butt if it wasn't for the backing of my union, I'd likely be unemployed and unable to work. I'm still on 'light duties,' sorting mail on the 'graveyard shift,' but I'm also quite able to 'earn my keep'. Oh yeah . . . .   the house with the broken stair . . . .   I had cut off delivery several months before my 'accident,' but was ORDERED to deliver their mail, or be FIRED! AFTER I was hurt, the house owner was ORDERED to move the mail box to the bottom of the stairs! And here I am, unable to do the job I loved, and in constant pain . . ..   This is just a small example of what it looks like from the inside . . ..  I know there will be a few of you out there who would have fired me the second I was injured . . .    but these things DO happen, no matter how careful you are! Yes, there are people around me who do 'swing the lead,' but there are legitimate injuries too, and people who, through no fault of their own, if they have no one to 'go to bat' for them, end up just being thrown on the 'scrap heap', just like trash!"
688971,Fish Farmer,2012-04-21 11:58:00,2234,"Can't imagine going through life you can't have a couple drinks at someones wedding or at some other function, fishing trip. Sorry I have to work next week, not aloud to drink anymore. I guess were not supposed to get hurt. Same people that owns that place, throws their wounded soldiers to the streets. I know what you mean Pic's I worked there 38 years. Some bad eggs made it bad for every one. Just like fisherman littering and walking out on thin ice. All fisherman are idiots. I guess your alright it you can go through life and not get sick,hurt. But if you got dealt a bad hand, your trash. Some people are so perfect."
688972,aplumma,2012-04-21 12:03:00,6896,"Actually all three would be fired from my company. The first because what you do on your time is relevant on the job if it carries over into the time I employee you. If you drink on Sunday and show up with alcohol effects including ""just a hangover"" you are giving me less than 100% being both a moral issue and a safety issue, kind of like stealing from me. The second guy lied on his health application and can't be trusted. He is a long term workman compensation liability that will cost me in the long run. The third guy is number two who just keep his mouth shut. While these things sound like I am harsh the truth of the matter is a company can't pay the good people the money they deserve if they have all of the bills from the ones that suck up more of the resources. Suppose the company is not sharing the money they save by getting rid of the ones that cost them....why are you working there? Both sides the employer and the employee have different views on this subject because both sides have different liabilities for there actions. If an employee loses his job because he smoked a few on ""his"" time and it is identified on a drug test he feels injustice has been done since he is 100% not stoned on the day he got tested. The employer how ever finds the same employee who is good at work on time etc and gives him a break and does not fire him now has put the company in danger because this good employee a week later wrecks a truck and injured his helper for the day. Out comes the info that the employer did not fire a known drug user and allowed him to drive a company vehicle with a passenger man o man that is a lawyers dream come true. While this is not some thing a company takes the time to tell the employees this is some of the other side of the coin information that hopefully helps you see that business is business and it is not always personally about you.

688975,craigdritchie,2012-04-21 12:45:00,1586,"Art raises a good point. We live in a world run by lawyers and insurance companies, so as soon as you include the terms ""operate heavy equipment"" and ""failed drug test"" in the same discussion, you know where it's going to wind up.  Health claims, in particular, are an enormous expense for any employer/insurer, so they will be scrutinized even more closely in the future. No problem if someone's legitimately injured and can't work. But come on, if you're off on sick leave and out bombing around on your bike, or re-doing the siding on your house, then you're basically asking for it. I know a guy who had a ""bad back"" and went on long term disability. Then the insurance investigator took some video of him out on his jet ski. Guess what happened next? To this day he says the company screwed him, but let's be honest - who was screwing who?  Spiel - I have no idea what company you're talking about, and maybe it is run by a bunch of dicks. But this kind of employee scrutiny is becoming more commonplace in every industry. Even good companies run by great people are introducing ""zero tolerance"" policies. I think it's got to a point they can't afford not to."
688976,Big Cliff,2012-04-21 13:03:00,6899,"When I was in the army things like sun burn and hangovers were considered ""self inflicted injuries"". If they were preventable by you but you didn't prevent them, you better not let them stand in the way of you doing your job 100%. If you want sympathy you can find it in the dictionary!"
688979,woodenboater,2012-04-21 13:24:00,2277,"The company I work is pretty fair over all. A number of years a go a colleague in my department got busted for DUI but ended up swapping positions for the year with another colleague who worked inside. He was lucky but I don't think he ever was able to truly control his drinking. Can't remember if we also have a drug policy or not but am presuming we do.  and yeah, my company would probably pink slip the three guys as well, after much discussion with the union. Well maybe not so much discussion for the drug and siding guys, the one with sciatic problems would involve more negotiations."
688980,crappieperchhunter,2012-04-21 13:24:00,2582,"Gotta agree with the hardliners here. All three would have been getting the ""Donald Trump"" from me too. The world we live in and the people in it have steered it towards this. It's unfortunate...but it is reality."
