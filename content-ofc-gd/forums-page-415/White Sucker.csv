679935,Christopheraaron,2012-03-25 21:42:00,3525,"I was out for suckers again at a couple of rivers and creeks today, I caught 8 dace and nothing else, was using worms and was probably up about 2km from mouth."
680006,mikeseb,2012-03-25 23:49:00,201,"was out again today and was into a ton of suckers, well over 20 hook ups in  2 hours.  again all fish were on worms.  "
680013,Christopheraaron,2012-03-25 23:55:00,3525," Are they well up the rivers now, because I've been fishing pretty far up and haven't seen any?"
680094,Garfisher,2012-03-26 04:08:00,229," How did you catch A dace, let alone 8?"
680112,Christopheraaron,2012-03-26 11:10:00,3525," I think that they're dace i'm not sure but I know that they're a baitfish, I catch them in my local creek whenever I feel like getting out. Here's a picture of one maybe you can tell me what it is? "
680122,Nipfisher,2012-03-26 12:12:00,2449,"Stupid question....but....are the dandelions out down there yet? I have always been told ""the suckers run when the dandelions come"". At least in North Bay anyways."
680184,mikeseb,2012-03-26 15:35:00,201, Saw a bunch of dandelions yesterday when i was sucker fishing so to answer your question YES lol
680185,BillM,2012-03-26 15:43:00,17367, Creek chub.
680188,rhymobot,2012-03-26 15:46:00,174,"thanks for all the replies.  saw them in etobicoke creek but there were only 5. came back 15 mins later and only saw 2 of them there.  the place where i've seen like 3 dozen concentrated within a 20 yard space and in 2 feet of water which was cooksville creek under lakeshore, was not possible this year. the mouth of the creek has a sandbar right across. the carp might not even make it in unless the water level rises.  it didn't look like the water level was lower than usual so i was surprised to see the sandbar right across. and i've seen a couple of 'bows in this shallow creek before so it's a damn shame."
680196,Dan668,2012-03-26 16:08:00,1120,"Bows in cooksville? It's so shallow, i always see the sand bar there"
680199,Garfisher,2012-03-26 16:19:00,229, I 2nd that ID Chubs themselves can put up a decent fight when they get big enough.
680202,BillM,2012-03-26 16:32:00,17367, I've been fooled one to many times by creek chubs thinking they are nice brookies
680203,rhymobot,2012-03-26 16:37:00,174, Ya I've seen a handful of them over the last few years. One at a time. The sandbar has always been jutting out there but right now its all the way across.
680210,amikwa,2012-03-26 16:54:00,2,"Ya the suckers are running good now on my end,  lake huron tribs/ maitland,  nine mile ect..  rainbow up the river for a few weeks now, slowed down.  get some more when they head back down river.   its warm this spring i hope they stay long like last year.  I only fly fish and got a couple big suckers already this year. try some big kaufman nymphs or fuzzy large black stone-fly nymphs."
680229,Christopheraaron,2012-03-26 17:32:00,3525," Ok, I know that they fight pretty good, I caught my pb yesterday, about 13""."
681286,mikeseb,2012-03-29 00:12:00,201,fish for suckers today from about 130-6.  Well over 20 hook ups and about 20 fish landed.
681288,Christopheraaron,2012-03-29 00:14:00,3525,I gotta say that I'm really exited that I'm going on vacation but at the same time a little disappointed that I'm missing out on the crappie and sucker at their peak!
682825,Locnar,2012-04-02 03:16:00,645,Suckers have definitely started stacking up in my area. Landed numerous all around 20 inches. Good luck Richmond.
684238,azebra,2012-04-06 11:26:00,168," I would have to disagree, Ive witnessed bows spawning in as cold as 1-2 Celsius"
690253,Christopheraaron,2012-04-26 04:00:00,3525,"FINALLY!! I got that sucker, about 1.5 pounds, out of a pond around here! Sorry no pics this time."
690276,rhymobot,2012-04-26 11:31:00,174,Good good. It finally paid off.
690414,Sharkbait22,2012-04-26 22:13:00,297, You have misread my post.
678401,Photoz,2012-03-22 02:49:00,792,If you went up to Beaverton and saw fish jumping . . . ..   YOU SAW SUCKERS! Where were you . ..   over at the boat launch or down by the restaraunt? Have they cleaned up all the construction yet? Which side of the river were you on?
678522,Christopheraaron,2012-03-22 17:22:00,3525,"Really? I was right at the mouth I just assumed that they were bass feeding I was on the yacht club side. Are there any rivers closer to cooks bay that have them running? I was using bread, I also found some dead minnows from seagulls that I also tried jigging, should I try something else?"
678536,Live2fish85,2012-03-22 17:42:00,1633,Try a worm and a small hook and they will find it.  I have got a bunch of them already.
678577,Christopheraaron,2012-03-22 19:44:00,3525,how deep? I think the water is about 8 ft at the deepest. maybe send me a PM this is getting pretty specific.
678595,Christopheraaron,2012-03-22 20:20:00,3525,Do they get a good run in bronte creek? What about etimbroke? wilmot? again send me a PM
678637,Locnar,2012-03-22 22:11:00,645,Quick question...  I know this creek near my house holds alot of suckers during spawning time. Are white suckers open all year??
678642,Christopheraaron,2012-03-22 22:37:00,3525,I'll tell you if you tell me where it is.     seriously.
678665,Garfisher,2012-03-22 23:46:00,229, Yes unless that creek has a sanctuary or different rules than other waterbodies.
678667,Christopheraaron,2012-03-22 23:55:00,3525,Come on garfisher! I had a deal going!
678852,Live2fish85,2012-03-23 16:27:00,1633,Sucker fish are not on the regs just like carp. Only thing not allowing you to fish them is if the creek is a sanctuary as Garfisher said.  Richmond Hill fisher. Suckers are the easiest fish to catch right now just go look in any creek walk along the creek and you will see them take off. I have seen them in ditches that go to the lake. Just look and you will find them. I sent you a pm to help you out the other day. Any creek will have them now. Like the steelhead and many other fish they run up the creek to spawn.
678888,mikeseb,2012-03-23 18:00:00,201,Went out sucker fishing again yesterday.  4 for 6.  Nothing too big biggest being around 3pounds.  Best part was it was warm enough to leave the waders at home!
679063,Photoz,2012-03-23 23:22:00,792,"I'm not sure what river you were at, but there's no yacht club to fish from at the mouth of the Beaver River? I went up today . . . .   noon till 5:00 p. m., got ONE LOUSY 12"" CATFISH . . . .    no jumpers yet . . . .   I only had to use 3 worms. The water is just thick with those little teeny emerald shiners! If the suckers are in there someplace, they're likely stuffed with the l'il shiners.  P. S.  Since when did sea gulls start leaving dead minnows layin' around?"
679066,misfish,2012-03-23 23:39:00,29133," Well Steve,would eat dead minnows or what Ryans using,,,,,,,,,   Good to hear from you Steve"
679082,Christopheraaron,2012-03-23 23:59:00,3525,"The yacht club is kind of hidden but it's there, there were fish jumping then the shiners were like a mat over the river so I also tried a jerkbait when I saw them jumping. I felt really bad, 'cause on cast I saw the bobber moving so I pulled up on it and it turns out that the shiners were just bumping the line swimming by and I hooked one through the stomach.  Listen, beaverton is really far do they have them in the holland?"
679505,mikeseb,2012-03-24 22:59:00,201,"me and a buddy went out today for suckers, caught so many that we lost count!  all fish were caught on worms"
679506,Christopheraaron,2012-03-24 23:03:00,3525," HELP! I can't make up my mind, should I go for erie perch or for ontario sucker tomorrow!"
679530,crossover,2012-03-24 23:40:00,172,Do suckers make it up dams?
679538,Christopheraaron,2012-03-24 23:57:00,3525,"Maybe if there is a fish ladder, but they don't seem strong enough, they might though?"
679666,mikeseb,2012-03-25 02:47:00,201,
679737,rhymobot,2012-03-25 13:41:00,174,Where are the suckers now in the west end? Checked cooksville creek this morn but there is a sand bar at the mouth now blocking access.
679750,mikeseb,2012-03-25 14:27:00,201," try a different creek or go a bit further upstream, they are in there u just gotta find em."
679752,mirogak,2012-03-25 14:31:00,387,"I was at the Rouge River tribs yesterday and they were lots of them, also saw rainbows and brown trout.  On a separate note, do people eat suckers?"
679828,crossover,2012-03-25 17:00:00,172," Meat is very mushy and lots of small bones, but I heard that people pickle them."
679831,MJL,2012-03-25 17:18:00,2427, Back in the day I remember watching an In-Fisherman segment on cooking suckers...The chef ground the meat and turned it into a burger. Never tried eating suckers myself. My neighbour (now passed) used to pickle and can them back in the 1940's.
679868,Photoz,2012-03-25 18:36:00,792,"White suckers, taken from the cold water, is almost as tasty as whities or pickerel. The down side is the 15 minutes it takes to spit out all the l'il hair-sized bones from each mouthful! The BIG suckers that come in from Lake Simcoe (average about 3 pounds) seem to be slighty less boney but still have more bones than your average fish for the table. When I was a kid (50 - 55 years ago) we used to catch a couple bushels of (red) suckers in a nearby creek every spring. My grandmother used to pickle them, using a big ol' pressure cooker . . . .   this was our whole winter's fish . . .   she used a few different herbs & spices . . .  .    DE E E E L I C I O U S! Who could afford a dime for a big tin of salmon?"
675292,Christopheraaron,2012-03-12 16:30:00,3525,"Hi, I'm new to this forum, I know that this fish is not the most popular but I have an itching to do some fly fishing now that the rivers are free of ice, does anyone have some suggestions for how to catch these (preferably in the gta), are they even running yet? Thanks."
675313,Snidley,2012-03-12 17:17:00,620,If you turn up on any GTA tribs with a flyrod at this time of year (with the exception of part of the open water on the Credit) then most people that see you will assume you are fishing out of season rainbows using the excuse that you are targeting suckers (which usually show up later in the spring). Be ready for some abuse.
675334,Christopheraaron,2012-03-12 18:14:00,3525,"Thanks, I didn't think of that, well i'll be ready for it other than that got any advice for the run?"
675433,Joeytier,2012-03-12 21:35:00,3990,"Rainbows are in season, so long as you're on a stretch of river that's in season...  Check the regs and see what stretches of your local tributaries are open.  Use steelhead flies...if you're targetting steelhead, you're targetting suckers..."
675436,mikeseb,2012-03-12 21:41:00,201,Wont see the suckers for atleast another month.  All you need for bait is worms or even bread!  I have caught quite a few 5-6 pounders on leftover pizza crust!  Just use an egg sinker and leave your bait right on the bottom they will come for it
675438,DRIFTER_016,2012-03-12 21:46:00,10439,  Kind of hard to cast that stuff with a fly rod though.  Suckers will take pretty much any dark coloured fly from stones to nymphs to small beadhead buggers.    :good: Rainbows will too.  You will find them showing up in the next few weeks as the water warms.
675444,Christopheraaron,2012-03-12 22:03:00,3525,"Great thanks for the help, I think that I'll check out the open section of bronte this week for some steelies!"
675468,Sharkbait22,2012-03-12 23:23:00,297,Single eggs are good for suckers.  Water temp for spawning is > 10oC. The way the weather is going that could be in a couple weeks! Many steelhead will be stuffed with sucker eggs.
675478,Photoz,2012-03-13 00:16:00,792,"If you are from Richmond Hill, go up to Beaverton, right down by the Lake where the river flows in, not crowded & H-U-G-E Lake Simcoe suckers . . . .    my best one so far was 5.6 pounds . . . .   'Beans' got one 5.9 pounds once when I was there. A light 6' to 7' rod & 4 pound line will make a real contest outta this typa fishin.' With the warm weather upon us, my bet would be they'll be in there VERY shortly. The rainbows are almost finished their run in some of the eastern tribs! I've never seen anyone fly-fishin' 'em, but they hit ANYTHING . . .   why not flies? Once they're in, (by the end of the month) I'll let you know.  P. S.  The day that Beansie nailed his 5.9 pounder, Big Cliff & Crappieperchhunter were there too. I'm just assuming these are whit suckers in Lake Simcoe?"
675518,Christopheraaron,2012-03-13 02:44:00,3525,"I checked out beaverton on goog. maps looks good, and a lot closer than some of the lake ontario tribs. I'll look forward to that message."
675538,Garfisher,2012-03-13 04:15:00,229,Record white sucker is between 5.3 and 5.4lbs. Nice record suckers photoz
675588,Christopheraaron,2012-03-13 13:26:00,3525,"I checked up on the species present and there are suckers in there, the crappie and them are the only ones who migrate and it would  be pretty hard to mix up a sucker and a crappie."
677360,Photoz,2012-03-18 22:59:00,792,"I hit Beaverton this morning . . . .   taught several worms how to swim . . .   after a couple hours running my float up & down the river nary a nibble. But . . . .  there is only a little shore ice in the lake, I'd say there will be some of those B I I I  G suckers will be in there by next weekend. I also washed about a dozen good pike lures down at Bluffers Park . . . .   had a real nice one follow my red & white 3/5 ounce Daredevyl right in to shore, where he just sat and gave me the ol' evil eye, before slowly swimming off."
677390,Christopheraaron,2012-03-19 00:02:00,3525,"Thanks for the update photoz I decided to try the holland and got a few nice perch and one small crappie, but they're in there (good luck finding a spot though lots of guys)."
678008,Christopheraaron,2012-03-20 23:54:00,3525,"I never asked, at what temperature of water do they usually some in at?"
678107,Garfisher,2012-03-21 04:51:00,229,10*C is when they supposedly start running according to the Freshwater Fishes of Ontario
678134,Christopheraaron,2012-03-21 12:32:00,3525,Nice! were about there almost!
678190,Live2fish85,2012-03-21 16:10:00,1633,The suckers are in full where I was the yesterday.
678203,The Urban Fisherman,2012-03-21 16:53:00,2050,"I checked out the big creek dam in Delhi, ON - a little farther south but the suckers are in full force!  I used to bottom bounce a worm, or fish them with my steelhead set-up, under a float with a chunk of shrimp...  Good luck!"
678208,Christopheraaron,2012-03-21 17:07:00,3525,Since the crappie haven't been biting maybe I'll check it out tonight!
678237,davey buoy,2012-03-21 18:20:00,5505," Ice out is really early this year,do you think there biological clock is off? maybe."
678344,mikeseb,2012-03-22 00:25:00,201,"Caught a few suckers today and saw TONS.  I had noticed a few fish had a dark stripe going horizontal down the body from the head to the anal fin, any idea what these were?  Sorry i wasnt able to catch one of the different looking suckers or id throw up a pic"
678357,Garfisher,2012-03-22 01:07:00,229,"Probably a Longnose Sucker, although apparently male White Suckers can get the stripe too when in spawn mode."
678363,Dabluz,2012-03-22 01:19:00,701, Yes....suckers do change colours during spawning.  Dark stripe and often lots of red on each side of the dark stripe.  They also do a lot of jumping during the spawning run.  I guess it's to loosen the eggs inside their bodies.
678392,Christopheraaron,2012-03-22 02:16:00,3525,Just got back from beaverton! lots of bass jumping around me a couple of panfish nibbles but no sucker in sight maybe they're further upstream?
