690494,marrex_mike,2012-04-27 06:22:00,40,Hey guys im in the market for a new fishing boat and Ive been looking at the 2012 Polarkraft Nor'Easter 179 and I would probably power it with a Yamaha 115hp 4strk like in this pic....it seems to be a good bang for my buck and it looks really well built but I dont know anyone who has owned one.. If anyone has any info on this boat it would be great thanks.. .. the boat is almost like this one in the picture..
