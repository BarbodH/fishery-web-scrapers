689662,Joey,2012-04-23 23:07:00,9122,"I've had one American Pitbull and one Boxer/Bulldog cross and now own my little Ralphie, a French Bulldog.  I loved them all and they all had different, yet similar dispostions.  Friendly, gentle and lovable.  Ralphie is now 7 months old and the most lovable dog in the world  "
689674,misfish,2012-04-23 23:38:00,29133,"That pic J says,,,,Paul,get away from my pillow.LOL  Ralphie is so cute."
689700,Twocoda,2012-04-24 01:02:00,4130,Ive been watching Ralphie grow up as you guys post pics of him...im glad you added him to this thread... i see he loves to lay in front of a fire too...how is he for energy? Do you have to exhaust him on a daily basis...Can he swim?
689903,Joey,2012-04-24 20:50:00,9122," Nah, he's a sleeper most of the time.  They say 15 to 20 minutes of a walk per day is all they need, but I've taken him on hour walks and he's okay.  They get hot fast tho, so  you have to watch them in the humid weather.  He does have about 3 times a day where he's running around the house like a bat out of hell.  It's the funniest thing you'ver ever seen.  Gets a burst of energy for about 10 - 15 minutes and just goes nuts.  Not sure if he can swim yet as the water is too cold to test it out, but I'm sure with the life vest, he'll be fine.  I'll swim with him and make sure he's okay every time anyhow so, I'll update you on that as the summer approaches.  Thanks for asking!"
690952,fishinfool,2012-04-28 19:23:00,366,"There are some nice looking pups on here. I looked at Boxers and Bulldogs and then ended up getting an Australian Shepherd. Best dog I ever owned and by far, the smartest!  "
690957,nofish4me,2012-04-28 19:55:00,404," Misconception, I think I saw her once at Tracy Starr's in London, or it might have been Edmonton. it was a long time ago.  If anyone is interested in dog behavior, go visit your local pound and ask some questions. You might be surprised at the answers."

684493,paul_614,2012-04-07 03:46:00,168,I would put my pit/boxer up against lap dog for being lovable. 
684494,Twocoda,2012-04-07 03:55:00,4130,i agree Paul.. stupid people should be banned...not the dog....awesome markings too....love the brindle colouring...
684495,Twocoda,2012-04-07 04:14:00,4130,Paxton gets refered to as a Pit all the time...it used to bother me that people couldnt see the difference...so for the less informed i made this sign and let them believe he is a Pit...  
684524,Fishnwire,2012-04-07 12:08:00,983,"I have a few friends with American Bulldog Terriers and they are all great dogs.  I think the biggest problem the breed has is that (at least where I'm from) it's the ""breed of choice"" for drug-dealer, biker-wannabe losers who think it makes them look cool and tough."
689416,Freshtrax,2012-04-23 00:25:00,2215,  Here is a few shots of fossa. He is a 3 y.o. Rottie bulldog cross.  Best dog ever.

689456,Freshtrax,2012-04-23 02:07:00,2215,Yea prey drive is high.  My dog has put more than a few birds and squirils to rest.   He  flat out outruns them in a foot race. Although cats he has no problem with cats. I don't own one but my parents do and he gets really upset when the don't want to play with him. Kids too he is so gentle.  That being said I will never leave a child who dosent know how to command him unsupervised with him (I would be the same way with a shih tzu)

689543,addy79,2012-04-23 16:14:00,573,"I totally missed this thread.  As previously mentioned, my gal and I are planning to get a dog, but cant agree on breed. She wants a golden retreiver I want an american bulldog. LOL I've wanted one since I was a kid (Homeward bound was my favourite movie).  Anyways, I've done a tonne of research, just wondering if any american bulldog owners could chime in with their experiences with the dogs ie. temperment, trainability, intelligence, etc.  My biggest problem is that she finds them to ""look"" a little intimidating  also, anyone know of a good reputable breeder in Ontario ?"

689559,Twocoda,2012-04-23 17:07:00,4130, I posted a response to your questions in the other thread regarding the American Bulldogs ..Our dog came from Edmonton but i know of a reputable breeder in my town here ...but he didnt have any pure white dogs...(just a personal preference) but his dogs are absolutely bbeautiful...if you are going for an all white dog ...do your homework to avoid some genetic fflaws such as deafness and hips....PM me if you have any questions
689562,Twocoda,2012-04-23 17:14:00,4130,Thanks Fresh Trax he is a good looking dog....is that an electric fence or a barker on his collar....mine never barks unless someone knocks on the door or its playtime...i was contemplating an electric fence but would like to know your thoughts on it if in fact it is whats on his collar...
689571,torco,2012-04-23 17:39:00,656,"Great looking dog, I am partial to the German Shepherd because I own one, but I tend to like bigger dogs overall."
689578,Twocoda,2012-04-23 18:03:00,4130, and your friends say nothing but good things about you fishNwire...lol...just kidding around...i know what you mean though...BTW i just found my helmet and im going to jump on my grandaughters pink Big Wheel and im heading out the door for your place...the dog is going to pull me most of the way so that should knock at least day off my travel time...and oh....i got the stuff!!!!
689581,Freshtrax,2012-04-23 18:20:00,2215,"  It's an electric fence.  He is only on it at my parents farm.  They are normally not as bulky as this one but he needed the ""stubborn dog"" collar.  It beeps and vibrates before he gets zapped. He has only got zapped once with this collar it pretty much dropped him.  Won't go near the horses, the road , or my moms vegetable garden anymore.   With the smaller collar he kept just crossing the line.    It lets him run on 5 acres with the oter dogs yet keeps him outa the manure  pile, road, ect. Ect.    He learned t in about a week."
689644,Twocoda,2012-04-23 21:58:00,4130," copied and pasted from the other post   addy79, on 23 April 2012 - 11:44 AM, said: very cool!  Is that an American Bulldog? Wifey and I are getting a dog in the near future and I'm pushing hard for an American Bulldog.  Is it your dog? Any tips/info you can share about them? to strengthen my ""case""  She wants a Golder Retriever...  Thanks!   Yes he is an American Bulldog and yes he is mine...the best advice i can give you when it comes to owning one is.... be prepared to exercise the dog and socialize him right from the get go with everything and anything....you need to do your homework on educating yourself on the breed...in my opinion the Bully Breeds are the GREATEST dogs ever to suit me....your wife isnt wrong about wanting a Golden retriever either...we also have one in our house and she is awesome in a fluffy subdued kinda way ....They are both family members in our house and each one compliments each other very nicely...so we get the best of both worlds....if its water sports ...its the Golden that shines....if its speed and jumping and just plain awesomness of loyalty then the American Bulldog wins hands down...both breeds are incredibly smart and live to please their humans Both of our dogs are protective of each other and us but if push ever came to shove (not that it would) the American Bulldog is relentless when it comes to protection ( which brings up the NEED for command training) One of the cons of owning a AM. Bulldog is there are alot of ignorant people that see the dog and instantly think its a pittbull and get goofy because of the Pittbull propaganda....Bull legislation IMO... A con with both of our dogs is ...they take up too much room on our bed...i have never believed in crate training (personal preference) but if you were to crate train them ...Im sure that would solve the problem... Here is a link to a bunch of pictures of our American Bulldog and links to educate yourself on the breed http://www.facebook....ada?ref=tn_tnmn  I will NEVER go without an American Bulldog in my life...for the rest of my life...to sum it all up....AWESOME BREED!  Good Luck with your desision  ill add one more con to the equation for both breeds you have to have a huge couch if you want to nap on it  "
