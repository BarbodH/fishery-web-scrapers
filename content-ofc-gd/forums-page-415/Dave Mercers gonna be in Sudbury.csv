Admission is free of charge to the 7 p.m. show. Doors open at 6 p.m. for best seating.  Mercer is one of the best known professional anglers in Canada and is the host of television’s Facts of Fishing THE SHOW and Facts of Fishing Tip Series. He is also the popular emcee of the Bassmaster Classic and Elite Series.  The City of Greater Sudbury is sponsoring Dave Mercer’s appearance as part of its fifth annual Water Gathering, a yearly event presented by community partners to promote the protection and preservation of our natural waterways.  “Each year, our Water Gathering partners choose a topic of interest to local stakeholders,” said Stephen Monet, Manager of Environmental Planning Initiatives for the City of Greater Sudbury. “This year, we’re appealing to local anglers, to raise awareness of their important role as stewards of our lakes and rivers.”  Information booths will be hosted by the Sudbury Game and Fish Protective Association, the Vale Living with Lakes Centre, and the City of Greater Sudbury’s Biodiversity and Lake Water Quality programs, in the lobby of Fraser Auditorium during the event.  The Fifth Annual Watering Gathering is a partnership of the City of Greater Sudbury, the Nickel District Conservation Authority, the Junction Creek Stewardship Committee, the Sudbury & District Health Unit and the Vale Living with Lakes Centre.  About Dave Mercer:  Canadian professional angler Dave Mercer spends over 250 days a year fishing for just about anything that swims and when he’s not on the water, there’s nothing he won’t do to promote the sport of fishing.  As host of television’s Facts of Fishing THE SHOW and Facts of Fishing Tip Series, Mercer has eaten worms, minnows and even plastic lures just to see why fish find them tasty. He made history by throwing the first ever “cast” in major league baseball and has jammed a hook into his hand to show anglers how to get it out.  Mercer’s signature style combines high energy and outrageous comedy with valuable lessons to catch more and bigger fish. His one-minute fishing tips are seen over 250 times a week on the nationally broadcast The Score and are also featured on The Weather Network and The World Fishing Network. He has also grown his company to include Facts of Fishing seminars to meet his viewers, affectionately known as “The Mercenaries”, and to speak with fellow anglers.  As a professional angler, the Port Perry native still finds time for competitive fishing. In January 2005, he set a new unofficial world record for the largest Tambaqui caught in the world.

He was pretty patient with an older man , this guy would disagree with almost everything Dave said and was kinda getting on my nerves, some lady was actually taking notes for her husband , Dave poked clean fun at her all night .....he took time to listen to all questions and answer them clearly... he gave special attention to a few little 5 yr old girls , all I have to say about Dave is that once again he's a class act..... and a class act that is 80 lbs lighter , congrats Dave!  A special Thank You to two more class acts T.J. and Monique for letting me hitch a ride to Sudbury.  I had a great time .  Randy "
