689942,Christopheraaron,2012-04-24 23:26:00,3525,"I'd like to try float fishing gators and bass this summer on those lazier days, I would think sucker minnows would be the most reasonable choice of bait however I have never seen them in a bait shop? Does anyone know how and where to catch/buy them? Also I'd like to try catching bait, how should I go about baiting, everyone seems to have different theories?"
689957,Rizzo,2012-04-24 23:58:00,4754,where are you going to fish? Doesn't make much sense to refer you to a bait shop in Orillia if you're going to Belleville
689959,Christopheraaron,2012-04-25 00:00:00,3525,"True, okay lets say mostly the kawarthas since their pike is so good, tips on capturing them would be great too!"
689960,Rizzo,2012-04-25 00:04:00,4754,"that place on the 400 just north of Toronto, Rack and Reel in Barrie, Jacob's on Hw 11 just south of Orillia all carry suckers. Also, when I lived in Toronto there was a place on Jane just north of Lawrence that had then (Cousin George's I think it was called)"

689985,Christopheraaron,2012-04-25 01:03:00,3525,"Great, are there specific features to look for when trying to catch suckers, bait?"
689996,Locnar,2012-04-25 01:42:00,645,"A little store in Pickering called ""Tightlines"" carries Sucker Minnows."
690056,bigbuck,2012-04-25 14:18:00,2449,"Get a big bobber, a 3-0 or 4-0 quality hook, stick the sucker under and thru the dorsal fin (middle upper fin), set your depth and dunk it and wait, when one takes the bait, count to 10 or even 15 before setting the hook (a buddy of mine lights up a cigarette in prep for the fight). It's a very very good technique when fishing from shore in the early season (up till the end of May or so). And pike fishing isn't that great in the Kawartha's other than Canal Lake. You need to go up to Lake Muskoka, Lake of Bays, Lake Rosseau for some decent pike. Georgian Bay is good too (Honey Harbour or Pointe au Baril) but you need to know the spots and the water if fishing from a boat. The local bait shops can be invaluable for that info."
