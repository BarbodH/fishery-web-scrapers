684381,Christopheraaron,2012-04-06 18:26:00,3525,I am thinking of going down to dunville tomorrow for some cats and I remember that there was a topic outlining some shore fishing access points can someone direct me to that topic please?
684401,Sandbag,2012-04-06 20:20:00,533,"Not sure if this is the spot you  were talking about, but you can park at Fishmasters Marina and fish off of his property.  I believe it is 5 bucks to park, but worth it if you go inside and speak to Steve he will send you in the right direction and can hook you up with catfish bait if you need it.  Just Google Fishmasters for the directions....it is right in Dunnville along the river (North shore).  Cheers  Craig"
