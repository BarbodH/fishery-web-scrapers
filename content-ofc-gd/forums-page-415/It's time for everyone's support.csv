690226,Ron,2012-04-26 02:26:00,1683," Hey Bob,  OFAH has been very supportive on this issue. They have attended several meetings with myself as well as Mike Brown to discuss this issue with the Town of Cobourg. Unfortunately, the town has given us the run around. We have gone through the proper protocol and now we are waiting to see what the recommendations are with the Parks and Rec Master Plan study. If our issues don't get resolved at this level, we will be addressing the Town council. The Town has to have legitimate reasons as to why no fishing would be allowed in the harbour.  Cheers, Ron..."

684837,Dano,2012-04-08 19:08:00,719,"Done buddy, no welcome wagon for those new to the town?"
685104,nancur373,2012-04-09 15:52:00,1211,Done
685587,Ron,2012-04-11 06:58:00,1683,"Sorry for bringing this forward daily but we need as many people as possible to fill out this survey. You just have to remember, we were all kids once. What better way to get kids hooked on fishing rather than hooked on drugs. We have to show them that fishing is an important role as a youth to connect with Nature. There is many skills which can be credited to fishing. Volunteer work for the community is one of them.  Please do your part and fill out the survey.  http://app.fluidsurveys.com/s/Cobourg-ParksMasterPlanSurvey/  Cheers, Ron..."
685589,Skipper D,2012-04-11 08:05:00,1970,"Done , perhapes next survey will have some fishing relates after they read mine & our comments added to it .......... lol."

686133,Ron,2012-04-13 02:52:00,1683,"I know there are still more guys an gals who can fill this survey out. Thanks everyone for your support so far!  Cheers, Ron..."
686205,ccmtcanada,2012-04-13 15:29:00,7971,Done Ron!  My suggestion for waterfront activities included a kids fishing derby
686212,SylvanOwner,2012-04-13 16:33:00,266,Done.  Bump.  and THANKS RON!!!!....from the future generation of little anglers and the more 'experienced' alike....
688490,Ron,2012-04-19 22:43:00,1683,"  Hello everyone,  There is only 5 more days to fill out this survey. I would like to ensure the kids in this small community still have an oportunity to fish all of the Cobourg Harbour as I did when I was a youngster. Some of my first fishing memories were from the Cobourg Harbour. I hope to one day, be able to take my grand kids to the same places I fished when I was a kid.  Cheers, Ron..."
688935,Ron,2012-04-21 03:22:00,1683,Just want to bring this to the top once again.
688942,fishing,2012-04-21 03:44:00,167,"Done, thanks for bring it to the top."
688954,Stoty,2012-04-21 10:03:00,2910,"As someone who was born and raised in Cobourg (21 yrs), I can attest to the importance first hand! Growing up I fished the harbour A LOT, as like stated before, is one of the few options for those of us that dont have a ""cottage"" to go to, or aren't old enough to drive, etc. I also know first hand how pathetic the ""Town of Cobourg"" can be. Hopefully this will kick their  's into gear and make them do something that actually benefits the community for once."
688960,lew,2012-04-21 11:12:00,12766,"There ya go Ron, keep up the good work."
688968,Fish Farmer,2012-04-21 11:43:00,2234,Did my piece. Good job Ron. We have to get the kids back to reality. Get rid of those phones
689104,radar,2012-04-21 22:56:00,138,"Did mine! Have a questuion though. Most gov't will only pull info from a survey that is useful to the results they want. Given fishing is clearly not on their radar, it is probably goinng to get buried. How are you going to get the disclosure you need? Will it require an Freedom of Information request? How the heck do you do it anyway? Can anyone help with that? Ron keep up the good fight! I don't live there but apppreciate everything you have done."
689129,Ron,2012-04-22 01:06:00,1683,"Thanks so much everyone.  I hope filling out the survey lets them understand how important fishing is to the youth.  Cheers, Ron..."
689480,Ron,2012-04-23 08:46:00,1683,"   Hey radar,  I have had several meetings with the town of Cobourg, I have been charged twice for fishing in a legal fishing zone in the Cobourg harbour. Believe me, fishing is on their radar. Short of charging the Town of Cobourg for harassment, they know how important fishing is to the youth and adults alike. We have to let the town know fishing is of great value to any community, recreational and revenue related.  To everyone:  There is only a few more days left to fill out the survey, please take the time to fill it out.  Cheers, Ron..."
689604,monsterfish,2012-04-23 19:34:00,48,Done Ronny!  Keep up the good fight!
689609,Ron,2012-04-23 19:56:00,1683,Thanks JW!
689622,Tom McCutcheon,2012-04-23 20:33:00,627,Done
689665,esoxansteel,2012-04-23 23:15:00,1307,"Done long ago Ron, please fill out the survey folks, fishing spots that are taken away, are usually taken away forever, help out Ron in his very worthwhile cause for both youth and adults alike. Kudos to you Ron, as weve seen when you sets your sites on something you follow it through to completion, and we hope the end results will be positive."
689990,Ron,2012-04-25 01:15:00,1683,"Thanks to everyone for taking the time to fill out this survey. I do anticipate that the voice of anglers will make a difference on their decision as to allow angling in the harbour in which we all pay taxes on. I look forward to ensure kids are not harassed for enjoying a safe and enjoyable past time. With all the opening seasons coming up in the next few weeks. I doubt I will have time to enjoy the Carp fishing which can be had right now in the harbour.  Once again, thanks for everyone's support, it will go a long way.  Cheers, Ron..."
690037,fishingwithbob,2012-04-25 12:50:00,123,"Ron, Iâ€™d be interested to hear what kind of support you are getting from OFAH on this issue, if any at all.  As a paying member I would think that this is the type of issue they should be dealing with and use the political influence they have.  Thank you for your efforts.  "
690039,hammercarp,2012-04-25 12:51:00,964,Done
683293,Ron,2012-04-03 17:06:00,1683,"The Town of Cobourg is conducting an online Community Survey to gather input for the development of the Parks Master Plan. The following is a link to the Parks Master Plan Community Survey:  http://app.fluidsurveys.com/s/Cobourg-ParksMasterPlanSurvey/  The survey should take about 5 to 10 minutes to complete and must be completed by April 25, 2012. All are welcome to complete the survey, so if you know others who would like to participate in the Parks Master Plan, please feel free to pass along the link. The first thing you will notice, they did not put fishing on the list of activities you do in parks, rather disappointed in this myself.However there is room to include fishing in the ""other"" box.  Remember, this is what I have been fighting for, to ensure kids are able to fish with in the Cobourg harbour. Very few kids are fortunate enough to have parents that have a cottage, own boats or are able to drive their kids to Rice Lake in order for them to fish. This is one opportunity they are trying to take away from our future anglers in generations to come. The Cobourg Harbour is a great destination for not only kids but for all anglers to come and enjoy fishing. It is an under utilized area for some great Carp, Pike, Walleye, Rainbow trout, Lake trout, Perch, and both Bass species just to name a few.  Please, please, please take the time to fill out the survey and make it clear to the Town of Cobourg that fishing is of great value to the community, more so to get kids involved in fishing and what the outdoors has to offer. Taking away fishing opportunities is just one more reason for kids to get into mischief. I would understand if fishing was dangerous.    For more information regarding the planning process, please visit the Town website at:  http://cobourg.ca/parks-master-plan.html  Thank you for your help in preparing a plan for the future of Parks in Cobourg!   Cheers, Ron..."

Fortunately the outcome was fast worked well in Toronto anglers favour. We can only hope that the same outcome applies here in Cobourg.  Cheers, Ron..."
