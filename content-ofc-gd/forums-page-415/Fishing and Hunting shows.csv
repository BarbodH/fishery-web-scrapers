Starbucks expresso roast is horrible!!!! Nasty beans.  I found that Dunkin' Doughnuts in the states had a much better grind.  Most of the stands in Alaska have horrible grinds which I find strange because that is where I first got turned onto expresso. Since I started brewing my own I think I have become more critical of the brew.

Bruce, you havent experienced the out doors, until you hear the hiss of 15 bar steam transforming lightly chilled milk into a frenzied froth, and savoured the aroma of strong coffee being forced through tiny strainer holes into a gently warmed Cappucino mug, all the while, hearing the humm of a 3000 watt gas generator in the background. Its a piece of rugged outdoor heaven."

690268,Billy Bob,2012-04-26 11:01:00,5865," A history lesson for you Missfish......  Starbucks Corporation (NASDAQ: SBUX) is an international coffee company and coffeehouse chain based in Seattle, Washington. Starbucks is the largest coffeehouse company in the world, with 19,555 stores in 58 countries, including 12,811 in the United States, 1,248 in Canada, 965 in Japan, 766 in Great Britain, 580 in China and 420 in South Korea, for an increase in 0.4%, 0.6%, 0.7%, 0.3%, 2.1% and 4.2% since April 5, 2012, respectively.[1] Starbucks sells drip brewed coffee, espresso-based hot drinks, other hot and cold drinks, coffee beans, salads, hot and cold sandwiches and panini, pastries, snacks, and items such as mugs and tumblers. Through the Starbucks Entertainment division and Hear Music brand, the company also markets books, music, and film. Many of the company's products are seasonal or specific to the locality of the store. Starbucks-brand ice cream and coffee are also offered at grocery stores. From Starbucks' founding in later forms in Seattle as a local coffee bean roaster and retailer, the company has expanded rapidly. In the 1990s, Starbucks was opening a new store every workday, a pace that continued into the 2000s. The first store outside the United States or Canada opened in the mid-1990s, and overseas stores now constitute almost one third of Starbucks' stores.[4] The company planned to open a net of 900 new stores outside of the United States in 2009,[5] but has announced 300 store closures in the United States since 2008.[6]"

Only coffee, not books or music or sangwiches.If saeco ever makes espresso/sangwich/ereader/boombox combinations, i will switch to another brand, cause the coffee will taste like dung.  As for the original topic, i noticed last night that there is a disclaimer even on swamp people,and Sons of Guns tells you not to play with guns at home"
690275,Billy Bob,2012-04-26 11:29:00,5865,I heard Saeco makers come with a disclaimer.......

690291,Dave Bailey,2012-04-26 12:41:00,1641,"I don't mind if vegetarians take me to task for fishing, at least by giving up meat they have the courage of their convictions. The ones who have no right are those people who happily buy a steak or chicken at the supermarket and then decry hunting. Phonies, no other word for it. They are paying someone at a slaughterhouse to do the dirty work they won't do themselves. If they'll admit they can't bring themselves to do it, that's fine by me, just don't pick on those who do.  I hate phonies with a passion."
690319,misfish,2012-04-26 14:47:00,29133,"  THAT WAS MEANT TO MEAN,THEY DONT MAKE THE BEST COFFEE.  I think they do something to their coffee and get you hooked on it like a drug.  Thanks for the history lesson BB."
690330,Billy Bob,2012-04-26 15:39:00,5865," Based on your taste they don't make a good cup of coffee......however, a business doesn't become the largest in it's own industry by not making a good product....my only problem with Starbucks is the cost.....even their beans from Sam's Club are  about $9.50 per lb.....so this time I purchased Sam's Club brand...it's a French Roast and I tried it the first time today....ground just enough for a couple of days and put the remaining beans in the freezer...it was DELICIOUS....  Everyone has their own taste when it comes to coffee....Drifter says he likes Dunkin Donuts for his coffee....I think it's weak, too weak for me....Tim Horton's here is a big hit and I like it....but I only purchase coffee one day a week while driving on Tuesday's....Since Starbuck's don't have drive thru service here I choose either Timmy's or McDonalds....and with McDonalds selling coffee for only .79 per any size cup....you can guess where the Redneck will be found...LOL"
690338,DRIFTER_016,2012-04-26 15:59:00,10439,  Starbucks beans suck. I can't help if the masses of sheep think otherwise. The same thing goes here in Canada with Tim Hortons thier coffee sucks but no where near as bad as their expresso!!!!  Try your Dunkin Doughnuts coffee with a shot of expresso in it. Much better. I have never had plain coffee at Dunkin so can't comment on it.  McDonalds coffee has come a long way since the old days. I can say that it is (at least IMO) the best plain old coffee to be had out there. Haven't tried their expresso drinks yet though.

689945,rmarentette,2012-04-24 23:32:00,124,"Every time I watch a fishing or hunting show, I get really peeved when they have their disclaimer about this program might not be suitable for all viewers. It rankles me that fishing and hunting are legal activities and it's portrayed like it's anti- social behavior. I stared taking my son fishing when he was two years old and I believe that it made our relationship that much stronger. If more families spent more time hunting and fishing we wouldn't have the problems that we have today. Does this bother anyone else?"

690021,Rod Caster,2012-04-25 12:00:00,5784, Suprising considering your country is the foundation for a litigious society. I guess Celino and Barnes haven't made a commercial targeting blood-traumatized children yet.

I've seen the bumper sticker that say ""Kids who fish, hunt, and trap, don't grow up to mug little old ladies"", or something like that. No, some of them grow up like Eric Rudolph, who killed 2 people with a bomb at the Atlanta Olympics. Disturbed individuals will find a way to vent their anger if they aren't raised properly, and there are plenty of good people who have never indulged in outdoor activities."

690098,Millhouse2020,2012-04-25 16:39:00,152,"I have definitely seen this disclaimer before HUNTING programs.  I think the only one we have that is exclusively hunting on global TV is Canada in the Rough and I have seen it before that program.  I'm certain its all about CYA with the network...   There are lots of people out there who don't think much of our fishing activity and especially hunting.  They just see it as barbaric and think that those of us who participate are mindless neanderthals and not brilliant enlightened individuals like them, sipping lattes at starbucks.  This became all the more clear to me recently reading some of the comments on globe articles related to hunting and the gun registry.  There are some pretty ignorant people out there.  My oberservation is most of the people opposed to our activities are urbanites.  I find people from a rurual background, even if they dont hunt and fish at least support the activity for those who do and don't want to see our priviledges taken away.  I also believe that hunting and fishing is a great family activity and can bring people closer together which cant be a bad thing.  I would rather have my kids in the woods with me or on the water then somewhere I can't keep track of what they are up to or playing video games.  I think there is far more harmful content on TV and the internet than hunting and fishing programs."
