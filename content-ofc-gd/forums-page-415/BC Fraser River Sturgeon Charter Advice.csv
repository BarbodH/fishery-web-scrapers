689717,DRIFTER_016,2012-04-24 01:49:00,10439,The guys from Fishing Canada have done several trips with STS and they always seem to do well.  STS Sturgeon Fishing

I'd imagine that many are weekend warriors and a few are reputable.  STS & Fred's Fishing Adventures & Fraser River Lodge  Could probably cover your needs."
689892,rock34,2012-04-24 20:22:00,215,"STS is a good one.  Ive only been once but we landed a lot of fish including at 9ft, 480lber......talk about a sore arm!  Good luck man.  They are a crazy dinosaur!"

690252,Sinker,2012-04-26 03:52:00,8692,"I went with STS guiding, and also went in may. Don't expect to get into a monster at that time of year. You will catch fish, probably lots of them, but they will average 3-5ft.  Don't get me wrong, we had an awesome time, with non stop action. However, our big fish of the day was only a 6ft'er. We probably put 25 in the boat though!!  The guys at STS have great gear, awesome boats, and they know where the fish are.  I went there for a May long weekend. Great time, and I want to go back in the fall for a real monster!! Anywhere they measure fish in feet, is cool with me  S."
