690036,d.thibeau,2012-04-25 12:47:00,10,"Hello everyone, just wanted to introduce myself and say hello to the community. Live in the Hammer and try to get out fishing as much as i can locally and usually twice a year somewhere north. Looks like this year it may be more frequent on both fronts as I re-introduced fishing to my 2 boys last summer (12 and 8) and now they are already getting the itch.  That being said, we are close to booking an outpost cottage on Onaping lake. Anyone been on this lake before? My be a little too far for the kids but really cant find outpost type fishing further south?  Anyhow, Glad to be aboard.    Hammer"

690052,bigbuck,2012-04-25 13:40:00,2449,"I'd imagine that most of the outpost type lakes in the north would hold decent numbers of fish to keep the kids occupied. It will be an adventure for them that they will remember for years to come. Make sure you bring a portable fishfinder, they are invaluable in finding depth and structure, as for finding fish......... that's up to you."

690237,d.thibeau,2012-04-26 02:43:00,10,Thanks to everyone.. Apparently we had a change of heart on Onaping. Brennan Harbor resort here we come. Loks like a good spot.
690254,Christopheraaron,2012-04-26 04:05:00,3525,"Oh, sorry thought it said "" live near onaping"" not "" near booking"" anyways I'm sure you'll have a great time. By the way where is the hammer?"
