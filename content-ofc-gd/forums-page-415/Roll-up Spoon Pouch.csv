690123,DanD,2012-04-25 18:40:00,2223,"We’ll be going up to Eddie North’s camp this July and I been looking for ways to cut some weight out of my tackle; actually my tackle boxes. Right now all my spoons and crank baits are in a couple of the ""special mate"" spoon boxes. Great box with the file cabinet type of dividers but the box is a bit bulky and it must weight at least 3 or 4 lbs empty. So I been looking and calling locally with no success for these roll-up spoon pouches. Has anyone seen them at their local tackle shops? I’ve sent an email to the people at Amish outfitters, they have the style I want; but I haven’t heard back from them yet. So if anyone knows where a couple of these are hanging; possibly in a corner of a tackle shop, please let me know.  Here’s a picture of what I’m looking for; all the others that I've found on line only hold a third of what these will.  Thanks. "
690125,Roy,2012-04-25 18:49:00,13728,Take the hooks of them Dan. Spoons in one bag rolled tight. Hooks in a small box or bag with split ring pliers. Hook'em as you need them.
690141,DanD,2012-04-25 19:58:00,2223,Yea that would work Roy; thanks for the suggestion. The roll-up would still make life easier; I think anyway?  Dan.
690145,Fishing4Tails,2012-04-25 20:18:00,38,I have a couple I'd love to get rid of if you need .. Pm me to see what area u live in .  Thanks Greg
690155,dave524,2012-04-25 21:29:00,4508,"The one in your pic is available from Amish Outfitters. Swap out the trebles for single siwash, they roll up a lot tighter.  http://www.amishoutfitters.com/catalog.htm  sorry did read far enough , guess you know that  the siwash  still store better though"
690160,adempsey,2012-04-25 22:01:00,1498,"Those are nice spoon storage options, but I bet I could fit all those spoons into a single Plano 3700 box   .   The empty box might even weigh less than that pouch too!  Also, I admit I am guilty of bringing in far more tackle than I would ever use on all my fishing trips, but I bet you don't really need 36 different spoons for your fly-in trip   ."
690270,DanD,2012-04-26 11:07:00,2223,"Thanks for the replies.  Frank the guy that sells the tackle through Amish Outfitters called last night. I guess he’s fishing a charter or tourney out of St Catharines next week? He said he’d mail the roll-up to me after he’s on this side of the boarder; which will save me about half the shipping and be a bit quicker to my door. I thought that was pretty good of him; he could have just sent it from his home and not be bothered with the extra leg work. Now that I’ve got that on its way, the search for a relatively inexpensive (but reliable) graph with rechargeables is next on the list. Don’t need GPS options in the finder; I still have my trusty handheld; just want a somewhat accurate structure and depth. Any suggestions?  You’re likely right fishlogic; I don’t need to fill the roll-up; but that one lure I’d leave at home will be the one my brother has and it’ll be the producer. I love my brother to death but I can’t let him out fish me; sibling rivalry lives forever. Dan"
