Trout, walleye, panfish etc is what we'll be going for. I would like to take them about 2 hrs north of Toronto. Their skill level is basic and I will try bringing them to the waters I know but any other suggestion would be appreciated. PM me if you want. Thanks.....Also If you guys can suggest a good rod reel combo for them that can be used on multi species that won't break the bank, that would be great. Thanks in advance"

690191,KShea,2012-04-26 00:15:00,18,The Trent system is good with a huge selection of fish and you never know what you'll get anything from panfish to musky but you should get something.
690215,ecmilley,2012-04-26 01:24:00,2163,"you can always try the piers around couch and simcoe lots of perch to be had, same as lake o can catch just about anything there, and as a easy one several dozen worms and duffins/lynde/marsh darlington.oshawa/whitby harbours circle hooks and catch bullheads to your hearts content"

Ask the locals of any spot near you, locals always help. Forum people with the exception of the few helpful guys commenting above me, arent going to tell you where to go........"
