690186,Burtess,2012-04-25 23:55:00,901,Found a set of keys this morning on the Oakville Pier. Looks like a house key an a couple of others.  If they are yours send me a PM and I will get them back to you.  Burt
690188,Christopheraaron,2012-04-25 23:57:00,3525,"Those are uhhh mine, do they have an address on them?"
690192,Burtess,2012-04-26 00:15:00,901, I already took the Porsche fob off it and am feverishly scoping all the rich neighbourhoods in Oakville  Burt
690196,Roy,2012-04-26 00:31:00,13728,Here's a hint for you Burt. Porsche owners usually live in a large house with garden furniture in the dining room and half a bottle of ketchup in the fridge.

690201,Christopheraaron,2012-04-26 00:43:00,3525,"I think we have another question to answer here, what is the owner of a porche doing at a pier?"
690203,northernpike56,2012-04-26 00:47:00,717, my friends dad sometimes drives us to the pier in his 911 carrera 4S

690218,Nipfisher,2012-04-26 01:38:00,2449,  What about the plane they fly?
