835661,Cudz,2014-02-11 03:44:00,2652,The fish who like the spin bait 80 the most are Simcoe perch.  Wow. Lethal. I caught 17 perch on 17 casts at one point.

834446,206,2014-02-04 14:55:00,563,Been seeing a lot of buzz on Spy Baiting. Anyone here that may have try'd these spy baits that could give me any advise as to where to start purchasing and fishing one of these lures.  I think it will be something new I will try this season.  thanks
834496,msp,2014-02-04 20:22:00,1336,Never tried it but looks like a nice bait. You can find them here......... http://www.landbigfish.com/DUO/DUO-Realis-Spin-Bait-80.cfm
834506,Cudz,2014-02-04 20:57:00,2652,I have 6 of them. Used them last year
834508,Roy,2014-02-04 21:21:00,13728,I have 6 of them. Used them last year  And what did you think of them?
834609,OhioFisherman,2014-02-05 06:38:00,6623,"http://www.lurenet.com/brands/smithwick-lures/smithwick-devils-horse  Similar lures have been around a long time, and cheaper too."
834615,porkpie,2014-02-05 10:05:00,2521,The heddon dying flutter comes to mind!
834616,solopaddler,2014-02-05 10:14:00,8605,"At first glance yes, similar baits have been around forever. But look closer. These lures are just a hair over 3"" long.  Downsizing your presentation has always been used when finesse is needed. I definitely won't be using the term ""spybaiting"" anytime soon. LOL!"
834626,BillM,2014-02-05 12:48:00,17367,The heddon dying flutter comes to mind!  Dying flutters are topwaters.... Spybaits aren't...
834657,206,2014-02-05 16:54:00,563," And what did you think of them?  Yes that's what I'm getting at, Works in Japan and appears Americans have embraced it but looking for any info from Canadian users?  Time of year, water conditions, sizes or colors... heck any thing?"
834662,solopaddler,2014-02-05 17:48:00,8605,I have 6 of them. Used them last year  That's a far cry from using chunks of hotdog under a float for bass.     (yes I remembered)
834679,bare foot wader,2014-02-05 19:14:00,1354,"cool looking bait, I'll probably buy a couple but wouldn't call it a new technique...""spybaiting"" sounds like the marketing dept came up with that  more a less a countdown/any other suspending or sinking jerkbait, with some fancy cosmetic surgery"
834684,Roy,2014-02-05 19:49:00,13728,Spybaiting rods should be out in the next month. I don't know how we've managed for so long without them.

834801,EC1,2014-02-06 02:49:00,930,"The cheaper and more moderate - almost panfish rods fish them best. Will catch fish, but I would compare them to a twistertail. Jerkbaits are more fun by a pretty big margin"
834867,musky_hunter,2014-02-06 16:20:00,328,"Although used mostly for largies in the US and Japan they work really well for smallies. Gbay and simcoe should be killer. Tried on NRX852 but a little too stiff, still have to find a new combo for it. I have a bunch and will get more at the Show this weekend."

I've got a Dobyns 704CB glass that will be getting some spybait duty this summer.     Should work well on the smaller baits."

Should work fine with a finesse reel. Buddy uses a Pixy SPR and DX701.  I'm thinking of using the XX Drop Shot rod or a DX702SF with my Daiwa Fuego.
834877,BillM,2014-02-06 17:13:00,17367,I'll probably toss my Calais MG-5 on it to keep the retrieve nice and slow.
835058,Rich,2014-02-07 12:20:00,3927,Dang. I popped a hole in a dying flutter years ago and continued to use it this way.. I coulda been rich!

I coulda been rich! according to you user name your are ""Rich""   Well I may pick one of these up and give it a try, not going outta my way to find a special rod just yet but we'll see if these can be productive in Kawarthas"
835352,Cudz,2014-02-09 00:04:00,2652," That's a far cry from using chunks of hotdog under a float for bass.     (yes I remembered) Mike, you have got it all wrong.  I was running a carolina rigged hotdog.  There was never any float involved.  Duo realis spin bait 80s are real nice.  They have great detail and for such a small bait, they can be casted a good distance with 6-8 pound fluoro.  Do they work in southern Ontario.  maybe.   The one thing you will find when you get one (you should probably get at least 2 as I only have 3 left) is that they are tiny.  The hooks are razor sharp but tiny too.  I wish they made a spin bait 100."
835353,Cudz,2014-02-09 00:07:00,2652,I was actually using the spy bait technique early last summer with another lure I had  before I got my spin baits.  These other baits are quite rare but they work awesome and are way bigger than the duo spin bait and they way 3/4 ounces and cast a million miles. Another bait that can be used as a spy bait is the lucky craft wander.  I had 3 of them and I believe I sold them all..
835383,BillM,2014-02-09 03:51:00,17367,"Chris, we'll have to try these out night fishing this year"
835400,lookinforwalleye,2014-02-09 13:55:00,4399,Yes and don`t forget the soon to arrive spybait line...made of space age material to let you really spy on fish!!!
