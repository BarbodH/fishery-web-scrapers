835708,captpierre,2014-02-11 16:01:00,2521,would like to see it on hardwood and throw in a few knots
835728,Dara,2014-02-11 17:31:00,3052,It looks like what we do when we put a bit of a twist action just as the axe hits the wood only this is a bit more efficient.

Not sure what he's splitting, but it's like the Silver Aspen at the lake.. has a bark almost like a coconut shell. So wet it splits easier than poplar. I too would like to see him do that with some narly hard maple in the back yard here."
835861,Sinker,2014-02-11 23:33:00,8692,That thing would bounce off hardwood. I have a 12lb maul that bounces off a good knot in sugar maple or ironwood.  S.

Lots of granite, lakes and forests.  But there are no hardwoods and that is why this axe is likely awesome in Finland, but would have a tough time with our oaks, maples, ash and elm."
