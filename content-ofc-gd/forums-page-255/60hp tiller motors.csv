836037,scugpg,2014-02-12 21:10:00,1373,good points...usually only troll for muskie a couple time a year and use the electric for walleye trolling.  but if the new one will troll down better might use it more. I agree I'm still dealing with a 17yr old motor if I run into issues down the road.
836039,porkpie,2014-02-12 21:12:00,2521,"I just upgraded my motor this winter.  While its certainly not a 60, my reasons where that I wanted a little more horsepower, and brand new reliability as I spend a fair amount of time on the water in the shoulder seasons and reliability is critical.  Third, and most important is that I could afford it.  I went with a yamaha, and I imagine I'll be quite satisfied, as I have been with the other yamaha products I own.  My old motor was a Johnson that was in perfect running order, so it wasn't out of nessecity, but just good timing and the right price off season.  If I had the chance and the cash to move from a merc to a yamaha, I would do it to sure!  Good luck!"

836089,DRIFTER_016,2014-02-13 01:44:00,10439,I upgraded my motor last summer. Went from a 1991 90hp 2 stroke to a 2013 115hp 4 stroke. There is a huge difference in performance. The 4 stroke starts much easier than my 2 stroke (especially when the temp is at or below zero). The 4 stroke is very quiet and gets twice the gas mileage of the 2 stroke. Another plus is the plugs don't load up while trolling like the 2 stroke did.  The new 4 strokes have the ability to fine tune the trolling RPM which is a big bonus. I have a Merc with Smart Craft gauges which allows RPM adjustment but the Yammies also have the same ability even the tillers.

This will affect the timing, air flow and fuel mapping any of these parameters pushed to far can ruin the engine.

818592,Steve,2013-11-15 17:51:00,2075,"ok, i spoke with CO2 Inflatables (they claim to be the largest distributor of Yamaha outboards < 75hp in Ontario).  they advise they have never had an issue with removing the restrict plate.  they advised me that they keep the plate in the event a customer starts having any issues however to date, they have not had a single issue from a customer.  they asked me if I was having a problem with mine (hence my reason for call) and I said I was not.  I then asked why Yamaha would sell 60's for almost $2k more than 50's, when it is just a computer programming change and a $2 plate.  They said that is why most marina's will only buy 50's, rather than 60's.  I asked if they do that with any other model - they confirmed just the 50's.  I said I've still not had my motor take ""two"" turns to get started in the four years I've owned the motor....I'm still awaiting the ""first"" time it takes me a second time to turn the motor over.....we'll see...  They DID advise that they would not suggest making a change on a motor when the increased hp is greater (50hp to 60hp just isn't a big enough change to throw off any computer settings - I can only trust them)."
818603,aplumma,2013-11-15 19:22:00,6896,"Good to hear the important question is will they do the job and be able to warranty it? I know as marine engines get more and more advanced they are now approaching the state of the art that car engines are at. Something as innocent as changing the air filter to a K&N filter will show up on the computer as a yellow flag because it is operating outside of the parameters that the engines computers normal working range. It doesn't mean it will blow up in this case it means it is adjusting constantly for this new parameter. Normal calculation is that other site+FF= T    is changed to AFmod+FF+T and this is calculated for all supported parameters. In some cases this is enough to confuse the system to the point where it resorts to failsafe measures thus  losing gains or it can cause it to not be able to supply enough fuel which is a lean burn and you can melt a piston or worse. Don't get me wrong I have built a few motors in my time and I have destroyed a few motors in my time too. Blowing up a $ 800 dollar motor is no big deal  but lunching a $8,000 + motor because I saw it on a yuTube video would be tragic. There are 100s of tricks we do to 2 stroke motors that made excellent power with a slightly elevated risk to reliability but when we asked Kawasaki and Yamaha if they would warranty our mod's the company always said no even when it was a Yamaha service Tech that applied for the Warranty.   Art"
818608,Steve,2013-11-15 19:31:00,2075,"well, they did the change on day 1 of purchase.  the only reason I know the difference between the 50 and the 60 is my original motor was a 50.  my motor came with a four year warranty.  how can the shop do a change on day one that would void a warranty?  i'll see what they say."
818639,aplumma,2013-11-15 21:44:00,6896,"I will bet that if your motor failed for a reason that might be traced back to this mod. they would be reaching into the box of restrictors they have and reinstall it before sending it in. I am glad the shop is taking care of you and turning a motor into a more powerful motor it has worked for you and the risk to you has been negated by the shop. If Mr.X goes into the garage and does this modification and it damages the motor and then takes it to Yamaha to get it fixed as a warranty issue he will be out of luck. What people do to get one over the big companies is not the same as being O.K. to do. Ask anybody who has played with the computer chip and items in their new truck and blown a major component if they didn't put the original chip back in and remove the modifications they did. I have seen dozens of readouts of trucks that have been ""chipped"" and modified that people have tried to get warranted. I am not trying to make this an issue I believe everyone has the right to make any mechanical improvements that they want as long as they realize it is their responsibility if it blows. Personally I have accepted the responsibility on some really awesome motors. I took a 60HP 650 2stroke and by remachining the heads, decking the ports, custom exhaust, fuel injected, lightened flywheel making 120 hp and racing it. We were getting 4 to 8 races out of the motors and then rebuilding them or in some cases blowing them up. In jetskiing finish in the top three and you got paid, 4th place just  meant you spend a couple hundred for a really great weekend.   Best of the day to you Steve   Art"

Just wondering if it make sense to upgrade. the merc runs well just doesn't have the bells that the yammy does. 10hp wont make a big difference on my boat. efi would be much smoother than the carbbed merc. plus new motor warranty etc. other element is I will likely only use the boat 10-15 times per year.  what do you guys think?
835997,mike rousseau,2014-02-12 18:55:00,4661,Do you troll a lot with your main motor...?  Cause the smoothness and bells and whistles are geared towards trolling in my opinion... That's why I love my new yammy.... I troll 90% of the time...  Another thing to consider... If you can get decent money for you current motor now... Cause if it craps out... Then you lose that money... It won't be worth anything...  If you have the $$$ I'd get a new one... It's nice having a reliable newer motor on the back... That's what will get you back to shore...

IF your thinking about a tiller, look at the yamaha tiller handles with the rpm up and down option with the push of a button.  you'll likely have to pay for the yamaha as the merc will likely be cheaper...."

818010,Roy,2013-11-12 02:20:00,13728,"One of the downsides to 4 strokes and as far as I know, there is no documentation on this from the manufacturers is the fact that they're so quiet (at least mine is) that all you can hear is the P hitting the water.

818037,Old Ironmaker,2013-11-12 07:03:00,8243,"Correct me if I'm wrong. The added weight of the 4 stroke may counteract the 10hp increase. A friend upgraded from 2 stroke to 4 stroke with the same manufacturer and identical HP output and is topping out at about 2-3 mph less than the older 2 stroke. The difference in the size and shape of the portion of engine in the water may cause a difference in hydraulic displacement effecting speed.  I personally wouldn't stress over a few MPH. A full tank, a passenger that should see Jenny Craig coupled with 2 full live wells plus a full baitwell will kill 10 HP faster than a bullet.   Roy, what did you say? I can't hear you!

Love the troll control... Trim placement... Shifter... Key placement... Everything..,  BTW to get the same features on a merc it's about a $500 tiller upgrade package...  Yamaha it's standard.... So is electric trim with Yamaha...  We purchased through Clayton marine in NY state... Very positive experience..."
818042,fishindevil,2013-11-12 08:29:00,6254,I have the 50hp Yamaha four stroke tiller and it has the pro tiller handle which is very long as has all the controls at your fingers trim tilt speed control and the gear shift !!!!! It has the speed control with will lower the rpm 50 each time you push the button or increase it 50 so you can decrease your rpm 200 !!!!!! It's insanely quiet when it's idling all I can here is the water Comming out of the pee hole !!!!  you can see the gear shift and right below it a rocker switch !!! That's the rpm increase or decrease and the tiller handle is straight out and no bending from side to side to turn it and all the controls are right there !!!! And well it's a Yamaha.    Just sayin
818048,scugpg,2013-11-12 11:17:00,1373,My current motor is a 4 stroke.  However the 60 hp is 20lbs heavier than my current 50.  Thats too bad I wont get much more top end but having efi plus all the other goodies of the new motor are intriguing. Would imagine I would get significantly better mileage with efi vs 4 carbs?  Does the yammy come with that pro tiller handle shown above?

818117,scugpg,2013-11-12 23:06:00,1373,perfect. would I see decent fuel savings going from a carbed to efi model? anything you don't like about the yammy? How is the steering friction adjustment on it?  thanks
