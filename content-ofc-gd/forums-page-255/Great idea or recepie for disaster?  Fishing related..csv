835715,BillM,2014-02-11 16:27:00,17367,"I bet the cops are just waiting outside cause you know everyone is going to drive something home, lol."
835720,limeyangler,2014-02-11 16:59:00,5204,Exactly the stuff  i'm trying to avoid while fishing.
835723,Dara,2014-02-11 17:23:00,3052,Looks good to me...have you got directions to get there?
835876,Rod Caster,2014-02-12 00:48:00,5784,What? No patio?
835878,irishfield,2014-02-12 01:00:00,26272,Nobody ever watch Grumpy Old Men.... I'm sure they have a taxi service... or she personally walks you back to your hut ! A bars a bar... you're supposed to have a DD to get you back home.
835881,bigugli,2014-02-12 01:18:00,6138,"How is this any different than the waterside bar at many marinas. Pull up in the powerboat for a burger and brews, unslip and cruise away."
835882,solopaddler,2014-02-12 01:19:00,8605,I'm going to go with recipe for disaster.
835884,irishfield,2014-02-12 01:23:00,26272,I'd open one on Temagami... but trucking in the Dancing girls from Quebec would keep us in the red...
835887,Twocoda,2014-02-12 01:32:00,4130,I'd open one on Temagami... but trucking in the Dancing girls from Quebec would keep us in the red... ill pick them up and deliver them...
835890,Terry,2014-02-12 01:37:00,14456,but if you got to go in the red I cant think of too many better ways..well maybe I can..lol
835891,SirCranksalot,2014-02-12 01:46:00,3291,I'd open one on Temagami... but trucking in the Dancing girls from Quebec would keep us in the red...  a few sheep in the back room might do the trick!!!
835896,Entropy,2014-02-12 02:25:00,747,"I'd swing by a couple times a year, heck it looks like a few on Scugog anyways."
835898,Freshtrax,2014-02-12 02:46:00,2215,Wish we had one on simcoe.... It's not like hooters if that far from the lake......
835912,Old Ironmaker,2014-02-12 06:11:00,8243,I wonder if you have to check your 50cal at the door.
835979,Dave Bailey,2014-02-12 17:36:00,1641,"Back in the 70s there was a floating restaurant that cruised part of the Kawarthas. Not licensed, but a selection of burgers, hot dogs, fries, lots of snacks and drinks, just like a roadside chip truck but on pontoons. You pulled your boat up beside it and placed your order. I patronized it a few times on Cameron Lake, and somewhere in my basement is a scratchy old Super8mm of it. It seemed popular with the boaters, don't know if it's still going, or when it stopped."
836082,iFish4real,2014-02-13 01:19:00,386,"I have a better idea...how a bout a ""coffee sled"" to go around the ice  ...like the ""coffee truck"" that goes around construction sites and plants"
836136,fishindevil,2014-02-13 10:46:00,6254,While snowmobiling up near restoule last winter on commands lake there was a guy had a tiki bar with straw roof and everything all set up and it had all the bells and whistles and lights right on the lake just past his dock it was quite the attraction and a well known spot by all the locals !!! Pretty cool idea ..... Lol .. The OPP would be all over that tho ... Thanks for sharing
836153,BillM,2014-02-13 12:40:00,17367,"I have a better idea...how a bout a ""coffee sled"" to go around the ice  ...like the ""coffee truck"" that goes around construction sites and plants  Used to be a guy out on Simcoe with a coffee shake, missing this yeaer however.   You could make a killing out there."
836176,TJQ,2014-02-13 14:35:00,7806,LOL.. that just a bigger version of of alot of huts up here lol....
836181,highdrifter,2014-02-13 14:56:00,2534,I'd open one on Temagami... but trucking in the Dancing girls from Quebec would keep us in the red...  Wayne it's a long way to Notredame for toothless squaws..
836216,Old Ironmaker,2014-02-13 17:35:00,8243,"I think dancing girls from Kaybec would keep someone in the black not red.  I once met a lady in Florida that had a floating bar and restaurant going boat to boat. Her and her waitresses were easy to look at and their uniforms consisted of a few pieces of string. She was very successful. The food was actually very good, fried Grouper burgers with fresh slaw and a cold King can presented to you by a (you might as well say naked) young girl, can it get any better than that for service? There was a line up of boats sometimes to get near them. Would never fly here selling beer. I bet an enterprising person would be successful if they had the right wait staff and good food."
836229,aplumma,2014-02-13 19:10:00,6896,We have ice cream and beer boats that travel the waterways down here.   Art
