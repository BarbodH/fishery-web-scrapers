835976,limeyangler,2014-02-12 17:22:00,5204,"Neeeeeeed more!!  Been a while since I did a real fry...do you use a deep fryer?  Yeah, a buddy of mine picked up one of these last year on sale for $40 at Menards in the USA. Its 18qt. Hook up the BBQ propane, couple 3ltr oil jugs and 20 minutes later….fish and chips. It works outside at -25C too.   [/url]"
