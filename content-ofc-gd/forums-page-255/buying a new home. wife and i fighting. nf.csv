You'll get a bigger and/or better house for the price, have a lower mortgage, and will have the opportunity to customize the house as you go.  I've worked on a few flips over the last couple years and will give rough numbers to give you an idea. This is in Brantford where houses are relatively cheap compared to the GTA and major cities where the profits for ""flippers"" are even greater.  House 1 - 2 storey, 4 bedroom, mainly cosmetic reno's, bought for $150k -6 weeks work -$20k spent -sold for $230k -new owners paid an extra $60k for the house  House 2 - 1 storey, 3 bedroom, complete gut, finished the unfinished basement, bought for $120k -7 weeks work -$30-35k spent -sold for $198k -new owners paid an extra $40-45k to have the work done for them  House 3 - 2 storey, 3 bedroom, cosmetic reno's + windows, furnace, roof, bought for $200k -5 weeks work -$25-30k spent -sold for $260k -new owners paid $30k for ""move in"" condition    For comparison, a good friend of mine bought a house in Etobicoke 2 years ago and has been doing reno's on the 5 level split since moving in. They've done all the work themselves and have spent around $80k on reno's so far and just recently the house has been appraised for $150k more than their original purchase price."
835701,Dara,2014-02-11 15:20:00,3052,"Its Sault Ste marie  Everybody is a handyman and flipper.  From my experience you basically get out of it what you put into it.  If a house needs a $20,000.00 kitchen reno, it is listed at $20,000.00 more after the reno.  You will get some wages out of it and thats it.  Would you rather be at work getting the wages, or at home listening to the wife complain that you aren't working fast enough when you would really rather be fishing.  Price a few places, add up what the reno's will cost and figure what it would be listed at afterwards. Ask the realestate agent for an opinion as well. Do the homework and the math....don't just assume that you can make money on it.  New housing is also up to date for energy efficiency, venmars, water pipes and electrical. Insurance companies give better rates for new than 30 years old as well. Just do your homework and decide based on facts, not guesses"
835710,captpierre,2014-02-11 16:15:00,2521,"Don't forget.  Real Estate doesn't always go up.  In the late 80's, bought 1st house at the top of the market (like now) for $192K.  Sold it after 5 yrs with some monor improvements for $155K.  Young folks haven't experienced that.  It's coming.  When mortgage rates go up 1%, they say 10% of people have to sell.  Their mortgage payments will go up by 1/3 potentially.  Be careful flipping.  I admire those who can gut a house and make it smile."

The only real way to make money on a flip here is if you have a ""in"" with a bank or agent and you get first swing at perfect houses for flips.old ironworker on the listings i see alot of houses with kitchens and bathrooms that need to be done. It is annoying and hard on these 2 rooms to be renovated because they are typically the most expensive to redo and it really screws up daily life so people never do it. They do however add the most value and give the most wow factor. Thats why i'd consider it.ch312 thats kinda the way i was thinking. She doesn't want to move a dozen times. The house we buy she wants it to be the house that we stay in a long time and raise a family. So we will need a family size house. This dream coming finished house that she wants is out of our price range. For the size of house she wants is going to need some work plain and simple. and to clear things up we aren't actually fighting we are just disagreeing on what we need for a home and arent coming to an agreement."

Found a lot, went to the builder, designed our house, got a price and had them build it.  As they were building I built my garage out back...sweet deal if you can talk the builder into it.  Anyway, house got built and there is plenty left for me to work on and increase value. Landscaping, finish basement...tons of stuff that doesn't make her feel like she is in a construction zone.  Right now, builders in sault want to build and are offering decent prices.  eithr way, you get what you pay for.  If you get a fixer, you spend all your spare money on it, and your time.  Interest rates are super low right now and you can add lots of value to a new house pretty cheaply.

I'm going to stroke out the idea of a new house. Its out of our price range, we are looking at around $150,000 house. The problem is that the carpenters house is always the last one to be finished! When i get home from work the last thing i want to be doing is what i was doing all day lol. We've been in our place 4 years and theres a few unfinished projects. I get it ""liveable"" and let it sit for a while. Then you add side jobs in there and fishing and what not and it really makes it tough to finish things. Before we list the house i need to get a few things done. i got random trim and touch up paint in pretty every room haha! I still dont like the idea of a flipped house though.As for why we are moving into town and not raising a family out in the country is because my place is only 1000sqft with no basement. With the by-laws in place  i can't add onto my house and its not really a family style house. Also the road into my place is terrible. I got 4km of bush road that doesnt get plowed alot and is sketchy. its not a road you want to take an infant down. It is costing alot in gas going back and forth. Between working, working, fishing, etc. its hard to enjoy the lake/bush here. Its nice to get away not not nice to be away in the wilderness all the time. This is also the only rural area i've ever been where everyone is rude and are jerks. Nobody talks to us out at the lake, nobody does the neighbourly wave on the road and nobody slows down or moves over. When i bought this place i figured i could enjoy the lake and bush while i as still young and not while i was old and retired. but nobody got time for that.I'm thinking finding a new bungalow with decent livingroom and bedrooms and in time redo the bathroom and kitchen and as for the basment maybe a partly finished one. Promise her if i start a project that i have to finish it by such and such date or there will be penalties."
835255,danc,2014-02-08 04:06:00,4677,"The old saying ""a shoemaker wears the most worn out shoes"", or something like that, has many truths. I've installed well over 1000 residential furnaces in my time, yet my own was chicken wired together to keep the old girl running. On Christmas day 3 years ago my ventor motor was vibrating so bad that it shook the whole house. Half of the blades on the squirrel cage were gone. Ouch. So I balanced it the best that I could and replaced the furnace myself between Christmas and new years day. I was working away from home at the time and if the old gal decided to calf while I was away it would have cost me 5 grand to replace. Doing it myself cost me $1300.00. Bottom line I guess is that yes, I can do that. But trying to find the time is another thing."
835261,Old Ironmaker,2014-02-08 05:19:00,8243,"wYou have received some good information here and some not so good. The first point I'd like to address is the notion that kids get into more trouble in the city than the country. That's just plain not true, in fact I think the opposite. I've lived in some pretty rough parts of Hamilton and have been out in the country for 14 years full time. Kids in the country are bored out of their minds. When they get into trouble it's not petty it's usually big trouble. The highest rate of teen pregnancies are in rural areas. The small little quaint town of Dunnville has the highest per capita rates of drug abuse in southern Ontario. Crack and heroin just surpassed the use of Oxycontin as it is now cheaper to buy.  Look at the drug and alcohol abuse amongst youth in our northern First Nation communities, can't get more rural than that.  Kids in the country can't see any future for themselves, if they aren't educated it is clear to them they will have to move in order to find employment. There are only 2 McDonald's in the entire county and 4 Tim Horton, they can't even get a job there or be able to afford a car to get to a job if they had one, so they break and enter, steal cars and sell them to chop shops in the area, and there are many ready to buy. They buy contraband cigarettes and make a living selling them in the city. Grow dope in the back 40 of the family farms here, harvest and go to the city to sell it an ounce at a time. Please don't believe crime is less in the sticks, it's just not true unfortunately.  As someone that has been married for 40 years I think I qualify to be Dr. Phil on the subject of marriage. Especially since I've been married to 3 different women and my research data isn't compromised by only one test subject. You talk about fighting, there can not be any fighting, this is a partnership, each partner has an opinion and that opinion must be respected. Why is your wife so adamant on a turn key home. Has she seen any behavior that has swayed her to an uncompromising situation. Is her father a person that didn't finish what he started? Or a previous relationship that went south because of something similar? Have you shown any behavior that tells her you will never finish a reno on time? There has to he a reason.  If you are as good in reno's as you say you are you will be able to clearly see if the work done before is above standard just by looking at the workmanship and materials used.  Happy wife, happy life. What about this as a compromise? Buy the turn key house, live in it and make it a home, big difference between a house and a home. I know money is probably tight but look to the future and put away enough money to buy a project home flip it, prove to her what you can do. You can do this with an investing partner or two. There are people out there that will fund it if you can prove you are the guy to partner with. Regardless what people say real estate flips are still doable today. The real estate market is bullish. I just ,sold my parents home in east Hamilton in January for 30K more than 5 real estate experts said was market value and 5K above asking price. My business partner and myself are shopping now for a flip. We are probably going to buy a lakefront property on Erie as our next project. There was recent sale here that went for $535.00 a square foot believe it or not. There are investors out there, you have to find them. Knock on some CPA's doors, they have investors looking to make more than a few percent in savings accounts, go to mortgage brokers that have clients looking to invest as well. You put a portfolio under your arm to show what you have done and go knock on some doors. If you don't have a record of achievements no one will invest in you so start making one today. There are many ways to do this as well of you indeed do have a history of reno's.  Compromise, make her happy, never fight, discuss with passion but never fight. I'm a bit worried for you. Not knowing were you are your budget of 150K won't get you a fixer upper within 150K of Toronto, it might get you a lot to build on. I looked at a grow op house the other day seized by the OPP, the bank is asking 233K as is. There is another in the same town for 189K and needs about 60K minimum, and that's not going with granite counter tops and porcelain tile. a similar place new is only 265K so that's not an option for a flip Johnny d"

You say that you are in the fire damage and restoration industry. Do you want to have to come home very day and worry about her pressuring you to get to a get a particular project done so that she can stop having to clean up the dust and dirt all the time from such a project. Usually that stuff gets through the whole house and into everything. Also, when you come home, are you covered in dirt and smell like you just been spit roasted over a S/P/F No. 1 grade stud fire?

Here's the compromise I suggest: buy a house that needs very little done on the main floor but either with an unfinshed basement(ideal) or one that's been done hal-assed(as so many are). You get to satisfy your building/puttering urges downstairs and she only needs to come down occasionally to do an inspection and tell you what a great job you're doing etc etc!!

We will probably try and find something that has the main floor done and a basement to refnish or just the kitchen. I know enough not to take on something so big that will take years for me to complete. She cant complain to much about dust and dirt. i bring home air scrubbers and set up containments when i work. When i drywalled the livingroom and hallway i started priming and she come home and asked if i even sanded. I do 80% interior work. i do drywall, painting and finish carpentry. i have done exterior stuff like siding and windows but im no pro but could get the job done.

Take at least one day a week for yourself and go fishing or whatever turns your crank (make it part of the deal with your wife, you'll do it her way if she'll agree that you get one day a week to just do what you want to do)! Sit on the deck and drink beer, watch the game, just hang out, whatever!

They are 100% complete and no room to add any value to the house. i do not like the fact that i dont know what exactly has been done. Now i work in restoration and i repair homes are floods,fires,etc. I do basically everything.

In town there is more serious trouble for kids to get into and you cant control as easy who they hang around.  FWIW working an 18 hr day for months isn't all that fun.

835049,BillsTheBassMan,2014-02-07 06:12:00,932,"It's a tough call.  I would avoid the cookie cutter new build variety home if that isn't for you. The fact is you both need to be happy. I would try and angle a compromise towards a good solid raised bungalow or sidesplit of the 1970 to 1980 time frame.   The bones are usually pretty solid, you usually have a property with it, they tend to be turnkey but tend to have 2 or 3 things that need an eventual update.  No chance of asbestos either."
835052,crappieperchhunter,2014-02-07 10:53:00,2582,"Construction zones are no fun for anyone. If you think she doesn't like the idea now wait until you have kids and your wife is stuck at home on maternity leave with a sick toddler and a bathroom all tore up or the inlaws show up for a weekend and your kitchen is not quite finished...been there done that.  As mentioned above buy a brand new home with an unfinished basement. Todays codes ensure a good standard all around on everything so the house will be sound, and you can putter in the basement without getting in anyone's way.  If this is going to be your home and not a flip house any work you do now will be old and tired before you go to sell and you can go reno crazy then. The kids will be out of your hair and you will have  more $$$ to play with and way more time. I'm there right now, 26 year old home getting tired and needs some sprucing up. Damned if I have the energy or ambition to do it though"
835061,porkpie,2014-02-07 12:39:00,2521,"This is what I did.  Mind you, the house had been well kept and had some updates.  There was nothing I HAD to do to live there.  The added benefit was a 70x 160 lot with lots of room.  I have to agree with the avoiding the city as well.  I live in a small town, well removed from the city, my kids are benefiting from it hugely, and I can drive 3 minutes and buy fresh corn and fresh produce off the farm all summer long.  Fishing is literally 4 minutes walk from my front door, and I can have my boat in the water in 10 minutes if I want to.  Oh, and the people are nicer!  All that said, my final thoughts to you are this:  the old saying of a happy wife making  for a happy life is true, fortunately I married someone with a similar vision.  If she is in tears now, it will be miserable later if you take her to far out of her comfort zone.  That may lead to problems in you marriage later, especially if you don't follow through with all the promises you made on the fixer upper.  Something to think about anyway!"
835073,fishing n autograph,2014-02-07 13:17:00,2540,Happy wife happy life. It's a tough pill to swallow but if you can't compromise get the house she wants.  Just remember every house will need renos one day
835074,Rod Caster,2014-02-07 13:17:00,5784,"Quite the dilema. I'm no marriage councilor or house expert, so I'll just say this.....    Good luck"
835075,muddler,2014-02-07 13:22:00,623,"Each of you make a list privately. The list has three columns. 1. Must have 2. Like to have 3. Cannot have  Then sit down with both lists and copy all the things that are the same on both lists in the tree columns. Draw a horizontal line and copy down all the differences that are on the two original lists  under the same three columns.  You may be surprised how little the two of you are apart. The last thing to do is to discuss a compromise of the items below the line. Ask yourself that famous question, ""How is this going to change my life 5 years, 10 years 20 years from now?""   If the answer is, ""Not much"", then give in , if the answer is, ""I just can't do that"", then you'll have to work to convince her to go that route. Ask her to do the same.  Put the lists away for a week or two and look at them again. You may be surprised by both your changes of ""needs"" in a house.  I found that when you put things in black and white on paper a lot of the arguing disappears and a lot of common sense filters back in.  Just  my one and a half cents.  muddler"
835076,BillM,2014-02-07 13:24:00,17367,"Which has a bigger impact on your bottom line?   If the end result is a proper house done the right way, I can't understand why you'd fork out all kinds of extra $$$ for someone elses flip.  That just doesn't make any sense."
835079,Headhunter,2014-02-07 13:51:00,5703,"You indicated that you are seeking a house to make into a home for you, your with and the kids to come. I fail to understand how buying a fixer upper is in anyway going to pay you back. By the time the kids have grown up and are off to school or out on there own, everything you did when you intially moved in, will be dated, worn and need replacing. My advice, buy a turn key home that only requires small fixes to meet your expectations and lifestyle. I always tell folks to live in a new to them house for atleast a year, before you decide to make any major changes. Time will teach you what you really want/need. If it was me, I'd be focused on what will make my family happiest in the new home and endless reno's is definately not going to do that. You already know what's not going to make them/her happy. HH"
835082,jayess,2014-02-07 14:09:00,187,"I argue the earlier claim that new houses  sound. Some of the $hit I've found in our 8 year old home is ridiculous. Insulation issues, lack of caulking, bare minimums everywhere.... Sure the house doesn't sway in the wind but all this lazyass corner cutting drives me bonkers.  One thing to consider if you hope to ""get your way"" is a bridge loan: acquire the new house earlier, get your renos done right away, move in to what your wife wants. Win win provided you can live up to your end of the bargain."
835083,Renegade67,2014-02-07 14:11:00,86,If your gonna buy a house that needs some work try to avoid the one that needs the kitchen done right away.  I've witnessed some break-ups over kitchen renos...lol.
835084,moxie,2014-02-07 14:16:00,1566,"Let her get the house she likes.  What's that saying:  If momma ain't happy, ain't nobody happy!!  Getting a fixer upper and renovating it now will do you no good in the future for sale purposes as most likely, by the time you want to sell, the renovations will be old and/or out of date with new styles.  I have several female friends who have agreed to live in a fixer uppers as their husband is a handyman/renovator and guess what, after many, many years, the homes are still unfinished.  That would drive me nuts to be honest.  Just my opnion, and you asked Looking for our second home(the one we live in now) it was my wife who saw the potential and pushed for me to have an open mind and realize that same potential. 9 years in I have done a crap load of work from paint, re-finishing the hardwood throughout, new trim and doors throughout,  gut and finish the basement, two complete bathrooms and replace 75% of the windows.  I figure the cost in materials and minor labour for things I couldn't do myself,  to be about $12,000-14,000. All is done in neutral decor to satisfy most and to maximize all style, in style for time to come. It's been difficult at times, walking away a few times to re group. I am proud of what I've been able to do but one little detail hangs around my neck. It isn't finished and with a kitchen and 5 windows left to close the deal I don't know if I have any gas left in the tank in my mid 40's to complete the job.  I can tell Mamma ain't thrilled with her out dated 50 yr old kitchen but knowing the blood and sweat that was spilled and scars thar will forever remain, she doesn't kick up too much fuss. After all,  it was her that wanted to do it this way.  Don't know many wives who have been happy with ""homes with potential""/ fixer uppers. If you do go that route you better have a solid game plan and timeline to follow. Two of my neighbours bought project houses. They wound up selling before completion as part of the divorce settlement. Even though there were probably other underlying issues there, It can and does cause some strain on a relationship. No doubt."
835087,Rustic-Fisher,2014-02-07 14:33:00,826,"I feel your pain LOL, I've flipped two houses for decent $$$$$ and the wife complained at the start of each project But never once about the $$$ made on the resale. Funny how that works. Had our first child during the second project, DRASTICALLY extended the completion . R"
835088,adempsey,2014-02-07 14:36:00,1498,"I am curious as to why your wife feels this way.    Is your current house one of those always under construction?   Be realistic in what you are able to accomplish within a reasonable time frame.  Just because you are qualified and capable, doesn't mean you will have the time and energy to do so.  Regardless, time to give in or come to a compromise, like an unfinished basement.   Fighting over something as big as this can destroy you."
835091,Fisherman,2014-02-07 14:39:00,7201,Sometimes a new wife works better..and cheaper..
835095,grt1,2014-02-07 15:28:00,638,"when I started building my house, I told the wife I wouldn't retire until it was finished, well it has been 19 years of retirement and i'm still not done, I think she's used to the fact that things take time. maybe not as much as I've taken but over the time frame she has gotten use to the little things that are left to do.  just remember, happy wife, happy life."
835107,Tim Mills,2014-02-07 16:15:00,476,Don't underestimate the material costs.  Even if you do the work yourself renovating is expensive.

I just finished our master bathroom a week or so ago... after about 14 months of seriously working on it in between hospital sittings and estimate I have a good 500 hours of labour into it. In another 5 months it will only be 19 YEARS since I started digging the footings for this house!  She's waited a long time for that big storage closet to turn into the bathroom it was always supposed to be......she should be happy.. lol  I like Dave's first response the best though...  As for ""fighting"" over what to do... I suspect fighting isn't really the right word, discussing might be a better fit? If not.. then suggest most of these guys are right."
835117,lhousesoccer,2014-02-07 17:27:00,442,"This spring we are putting our house up for sale. We want to upgrade to a larger home closer to town where in the future raise a family. We are looking at the local listings and we are fighting over the type and quality of home. My wife is looking at these houses you can clearly see are flip houses. They are 100% complete and no room to add any value to the house. i do not like the fact that i dont know what exactly has been done. Now i work in restoration and i repair homes are floods,fires,etc. I do basically everything. My ideal home is a shack that i rebuild to make my own but she definitely wont go for something in that need of a repair. So im looking for homes that need say a new kitchen, bath, basement redo and some painting. Things that can really add value and i get to do it exactly how i like it. She is pretty much in tears saying she just wants to live comfortable in a construction free zone. To me every house needs work and it never ends. So what should i do? put my head down and say yes dear and get a turn key house and hope they did a good job. or do i go against her and i take the final say? If houses didnt cost so much i'd go her route and wait 6 months for something to go wrong and say told ya so!! need some advice! Happy Wife, Happy Life."
