836714,landry,2014-02-16 22:45:00,1005,"Was wondering if anyone saw duo realis jerkbaits, luck e strike jerkbaits and lucky craft deep pointers at the show. I am looking for some. Thanks. Landry."
836753,Pigeontroller,2014-02-17 00:36:00,2793,I think so...Not much of an answer I realize. I think Natural Sports and the next shop down had some or all of what your looking for.
836765,ColdH20guy,2014-02-17 01:31:00,312,any reason why those specifically?
836768,landry,2014-02-17 01:44:00,1005,I heard the duos r nice. I have had good success on the luck e strikes.
836769,landry,2014-02-17 01:44:00,1005,And thanks pigeon troller.
836770,BillM,2014-02-17 01:49:00,17367,"I haven't had a chance to try the Duo jerkbaits, but their topwater baits are killer!"
836778,Lape0019,2014-02-17 02:44:00,647,I haven't seen the duo jerkbaits but hope to in the next week or so. I did read the rather lengthy review on them on Tackletour. They look really nice and I plan on adding some to my tackle box. I am a huge fan of Megabass 110's so I am hoping that the duo's are at least quality that won't cost me as much.
836781,landry,2014-02-17 03:46:00,1005,The luck e strike r a rip off of the 110's and they work great and r cheap.
836783,Dan668,2014-02-17 03:52:00,1120,The luck e strike r a rip off of the 110's and they work great and r cheap.  Just swap the hooks out and your good to go. Work better than my megabass. I loaded up on them last year when tackle warehouse had them for $4.99
836804,musky_hunter,2014-02-17 13:11:00,328,"ProJ has a wide variety of smallie jerkbaits at the show. Jackall, O.S.P,, Lucky Craft, Megabass, and Duo. Hard to find a better selection of brands and colours. They will be having a special deal today, go check them out."
836923,landry,2014-02-17 23:38:00,1005,I found the two duo colors I wanted and two luck e strike colors I needed to. It was a successful mission. Anyone ever fish the lucky craft pointer XD (extra deep)?
836930,musky_hunter,2014-02-18 00:21:00,328,Awesome...
