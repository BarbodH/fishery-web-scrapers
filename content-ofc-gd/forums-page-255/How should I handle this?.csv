Good thought but wouldn't that constitute an admission of guilt? Not what you want to do considering insurance companies were not notified of the accident in the first place. Do some on line research and maybe call around to a few sharks....er.... i mean lawyers offices to feel out the situation and go from there. A  one on one meeting with no witnesses present might be the only way to settle this. Just tell him to be reasonable or as N.A.W said ""Piss off...""  And under no circumstances leave anymore paper along the trail. Even keep it simple over the phone.   Friends father was severely injured in a strip mall parking lot a couple years back and after recovery, therapy and med script after med script the other party was neither held culpable, accountable or liable. That was plain wrong, this on the other hand was a ""Ding"".  Good luck."

Talked to my insurance company without filing a claim, and i was told that i can choose 3 shops (certified) and she had to pick one of them for the repair... It ended up costing me just under $500.

I think I am going to send them a letter asking for the name of their insurance company and policy number without providing any other information or admitting any responsibility. At least that way I will be able to confirm if they even have insurance which I sort of suspect they do not just by the way they reacted at the time.  The fact that it even took them 6 weeks to get a quote doesn't sit well with me.  Also, the person driving the car wasn't the owner of the car, again something fishy here, she owned the car, he was doing the driving and he was the one that didn't seem to want the police or insurance involved.  I'll let you know how this all plays out!!!"
835868,bigbuck,2014-02-12 00:12:00,2449,"Cliff, for that kind of money, involve your insurance company. At worst, it goes as a claim against your policy and most ins cos give you a freebie these days. 1800 is ridiculous. A couple of hundred bucks is not too bad, it's a lesson learned, that kind of money is pure horse s....t. more than likely, they either did not have insurance or probably no drivers licence. Having spent a morning in a northern court a few months ago to fight a Bull ticket (the officer buckled and failed to provide evidence, score one for the little guy against sheriff Roscoe P Coltrane). 3/4s of the cases involved people with suspended or no licences. I think they are trying to hustle an older gentleman here."

He is obligated to submit the police report and a claim to his own insurance company they then pay for the repair and settle with your insurance company at the end of the fiscal year .  You made a fair offer to him just because you are a decent guy, and now he is trying to stick you.  Had he been a reasonable person, this would have been taken care of by now, but his attempt at fraud relieves you from any moral obligation that you may feel.

No report, it's 50/50 in a parking lot, since you were honest and sincere and he a dishonest jackass tell him your damages are $2000 and you will pay for your own car and he pay for his own.

835924,Renegade67,2014-02-12 13:40:00,86,"Private property,.... others have advised is no fault land to insurance companies.. I know this might not sit too well with you but I would not provide partial payment. Someone who takes so long to come back with such a high estimate is not trying to work with you but take advantage.  I always chuckle when parking at a store and watch how ppl will do whatever they can to get as close of a spot to the door as they can.  I generally go to the side or rear where there is not as much activity.  Always drive through or back into a spot so you are facing out for the exit.   This will help avoid almost all the potential of an accident which is much higher when backing up a previously parked car."
835932,mukluk,2014-02-12 14:28:00,196,Have to agree with Renegade 67 .  I once witnessed an accident in the Mac's Milk parking lot and found the owner of the damaged vehicle (dented door).  In turn she phoned the law; their reply was that the accident happened on private property.  Sorry can't help you.  Smells like a scam for sure.  I would not pay a cent.  Let time take its course.  Wear him down by letting him have to contact you  over a period of time until he comes up with a MUCH more reasonable offer or simply gives up.

We exchanged info, I told her not to worry about it. I was going to scrapping the car soon. I popped a door on from the wreckers and never thought about it again. A few months later when I got a new to me car and went to switch over insurance, they notified me that I was being charged with failure to remain at an accident.

835973,spooner_jr,2014-02-12 17:06:00,193,"Whether the accident happened on private property or not is irrelevant.  The fact you were backing out of a parking spot means you would be considered 100% at fault.  Just tell him you can't afford $1800 and he'll have to go through his own insurance company.  If he has no insurance he's pooched.  If he does, they'll make him get legitimate estimates and/or have the vehicle inspected.  In either case, neither you nor your insurance company will pay a dime for this.   And the 48 hours to report an accident is to the Collision Reporting Centre, has nothing to do with insurance."

They were at fault, and their insurance company paid the full $6000 I didnt pay anything, at it was surprisingly simple.  I went to damage reporting center, they called it as I wasnt at fault end of story.  $1800 seems like a super high end quote from a very established play ie 427 auto collision etc.  Youd be surprised at what something can cost, sounds like hes hitting you high so he can make you feel like you get a deal when he says he'll take $1000 cash.  I say, send him to get 2 more quotes, waste his time and say ""forget it, insurance"" at the end....or pull up in a better condition 2000 civic you bought for $1500 with lower kms and try and get him to accidentally hit it.

In a parking lot, it's considered common courtesy/sense for drivers of other vehicles to assist/allow vehicles backing out of a parking spot. Did the guy honk his horn to let you know he was there?? Did not honk horn or anything and to be honest I was a little suspicious that perhaps he didn't have insurance because of the way he was insisting it wouldn't be necessary to get the insurance company involved. I think I might just send him a letter asking for the name of his insurance company and policy number. I know he is trying to run a scam here and that is the part that makes me want to fight back!"

We parted ways 6 months later I get a call from my insurance company saying that the owner was putting forth a claim of 2200.00 dollars for damages done by my car. The best part is he was claiming damage on the wrong side of his vehicle. I told my insurance co. I had no idea what they were talking about, and never heard another thing about it !

835830,Old Ironmaker,2014-02-11 22:05:00,8243,"The exact thing happened to me a few years back at a Hortons. I backed into a parked car on a dark rainy night. I looked at the Mazda I hit and couldn't see a thing. I went inside and asked if someone owned the Mazda. The lady behind the counter did, she told me she was going to call the police I couldn't convince her it wasn't necessary, she actually called 911, they flipped out on her. Anyway we exchanged insurance because there was a 4"" scratch on the plastic bumper. I contacted my agent and told him what happened. Turned out the car was 2 weeks old. I had 2 choices, file a claim or pay for the repair. I took a picture on my cell phone that showed nothing, it was useless. I was told by my agent she had 1 year to file a claim. A month later I received a hand written note that looked like a 6 year old wrote asking for $1500.00 they wanted cash. Knowing her address from the insurance slip I found the car and took a pic of the scratch. I called her and told her husband I wasn't playing his game, take the car to any real body shop and give me a quote. They took it to the dealer and the dealer came back with a quote for around $500.00. No problem, repair the car and I would go to the dealer and pay them directly. They responded by telling me they would settle for $400.00, now I was pissed. I insisted they repair the car and I pay for it. Little did they know my cousin works at the dealership (they picked it, not me) and he told me they wanted them to buff it out and give them the difference in cash. Fraud plain and simple. I then got the OPP involved.  A simple bump became a federal case. I then got my insurance company invoved for the principal alone. It cost me 500 bucks and they had some questions to answer to the OPP. It's getting me upset just remembering this thing.  This guy doesn't have insurance, a valid license or both, get your insurance involved Cliff and let them deal with it, no matter what it was your fault, you backed into them. Lucky they didn't call an ambulance.  As far as a $100.00 repair, it costs a hundred bucks to open the bay door for a body shop today."

A guy in a small Honda came from behind a large truck and stopped right behind me and the corner of my bumper dented his passanger door. It was a 2000 Honda Civic SE and it wasn't in very good shape but wth, I was backing up and I did dent his passanger door.  I gave him my contact information and told him to get a quote and let me know what it would cost to fix it.  Today, 6 weeks later I get a registered letter telling me it is going to cost over $1800.00 to fix the car and 3 days rental for a car to replace theirs while they get their car fixed and the estimate he sent me is for everything from the front bumper and signal light to the rear passanger door.  Now I am a little pissed, in a way it was my fault, when I started to back out he wasn't there, I turned and looked to the other side to make sure no one was coming and he was there. I wasn't doing 1/2 a mile an hour. There is a scratch on my bumper about 4"" long and there was no other damage to his car except to the passanger door and mirror (it got bent slightly). He was very adament at the time that it wouldn't really be necessary to contact the insurance company because the repairs wouldn't cost that much, now he wants me to pay over $1800.00 to fix his car.  I know he is trying to pull a fast one on me and my first reaction is to tell him this is fraud but what are my legal responsibilities here and how should I handle it?"

Unless independent witnesses were there and you were driving like a lunatic, impaired or otherwise, accidents on private property are recognized by insurance companies as equal liability and if claims are made, deductibles apply to both parties. Again, get some direction from your insurance company (which by the way is now owned by M's as of 2 weeks ago  )"
835780,Dara,2014-02-11 20:18:00,3052,"My son did this a couple years ago...my insurance company told me to tell the guy .....  I made an offer, he said no...I told him Ok, bye, he called back and said, OK I'll take it.  Cover your conscience and let it be."
835781,Pikeslayer,2014-02-11 20:18:00,1443,"Not a good idea at this point as it's obvious the guy is scamming you Cliff. Offer of money can be perceived as admission of guilt. In a parking lot, it's considered common courtesy/sense for drivers of other vehicles to assist/allow vehicles backing out of a parking spot. Did the guy honk his horn to let you know he was there??"
835783,manjo39,2014-02-11 20:21:00,354,"A co-worker of mine did a similar thing.  Bumped another car in a parking lot.  No damage to his car, damage on the other car. Went to a collision centre and they wouldn't handle it because it was under a $ threshold.  I forget the amount. The other guy went to get quotes and they were outrageous.  My co-worker said forget it. My co-worker finally called his insurance company (had the other cars license plate and insurance info) and it worked out that the other guys insurance paid for everything on the other car and my co-workers premium was not affected.  I would call your insurance company."
835784,JoshS,2014-02-11 20:21:00,729,"If he didn't report it already, don't think much can be done going the insurance route. His word vs yours and no police record. Should of definitely snapped a few pics however.  Ask him to get a few quotes for the repair and you want to see them in writing. I'm guessing he's not local to you. Let him know your thoughts and offer to pay a reasonable quote, or I'd tell him he's out of luck."
835785,BillM,2014-02-11 20:22:00,17367,"He's not going to repair that car anyhow, he's going to take that $1800 and spend it on whatever.  I'm sorry but I'd tell him to pound sand and take it up with insurance as that amount is insane."

Again, get some direction from your insurance company (which by the way is now owned by M's as of 2 weeks ago  ) LOL Yup, knew that was coming long before many others did (inside source don't you know)  I really didn't want to get the insurance company involved because I figured the damages were less than my deductable so why bother. I wasn't impared, and at 1/2 a mile an hour I doubt anyone would call that driving like a lunatic, Had he been paying attention to what was going on, he should have stopped when he saw my backup lights were on and I was coming out from behind a truck  instead of proceeding then stopping right behind me. I don't want to ""do a number on"" anyone but I don't want anyone to do a number on me either!"
835787,JoshS,2014-02-11 20:23:00,729,You can call your broker as mentioned and ask for advice off the record I believe. Nothing to loose.
835788,Roy,2014-02-11 20:24:00,13728,I'd send Big Jim and Viny the Chin over there to buy him a beer and discuss business with him.
