Coming up for a sniff, just laying there for 20 mins, but after a while they all started biting. I ended the day with 5 nice jumbos, kept 1 that I thought was bigger(batter additive was the influence) but many were pulled out.  Guy in the hut next to me was pulling pike out(no jumbos for him though .) I didn't see a Herring, thank God.  I forgot most of my lures at home accidentally. It worked out though, they didnt take my girlfriends minnows on a swedish pimple but they were attacking reg jig heads(with minnows obviously) and minnows on bait hooks. Some kept trying to eat my weights lol.  Im done with perch though. Next trip is going to be either lakers/whitefish or walleye.  PS. How can I post pics? I tried through imgur but the site wont allow me to use it. What else can I use?  "
