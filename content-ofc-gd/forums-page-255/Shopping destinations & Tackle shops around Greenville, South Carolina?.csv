836595,Pikeslayer,2014-02-16 02:22:00,1443,Not much goin on in Greenville unless it's drastically changed in 5 years.  You can always visit the Beemer plant??
836603,okumasheffield,2014-02-16 03:04:00,318,Beemer plant is where I am going for work ...  could not find anything interesting after googling for a while

836608,Pikeslayer,2014-02-16 03:27:00,1443,LOL. Figured as much . Not many other reasons to visit Greenville/Spartanberg unless youre in the auto industry. A few good restaurants in 'downtown' Greenville just can't remember the names.
