You get a few materials and a certain amount of time to come up with a fly using only those materials. I asked them if we could run an event up here, they say they're open to the idea, I just wanted to see if we'd even have interest before I start worrying about a venue. I figure we could host it at a community centre and get a rod or something for a prize if we all pitched in $10 per night. So who's interested?"
