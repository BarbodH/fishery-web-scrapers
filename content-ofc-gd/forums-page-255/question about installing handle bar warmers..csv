835636,Bernie,2014-02-11 02:23:00,3190,This is a question with a lot of variables.What kind of machine is it? Many of modern snowmobiles use computers to operate circuits. So you need to know for sure where you are getting your power.How many amps are the heaters going to use? You need to know if the circuit you are tapping into can handle the power needs. It's possible you may need to use a relay to power them up correctly.

835656,Bernie,2014-02-11 03:27:00,3190,I have no access to Yamaha wiring diagrams Richyb.Not likely a computer controlled sled.I'd likely look at the lighting circuit for a source of power. Often the tail lamp is always powered.

After headlight and ignition how much allowable draw is left? Can't imagine they're a really high draw item, but I'd be making sure before blowing what is running your ignition and lights."
