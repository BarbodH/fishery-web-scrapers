835000,irishfield,2014-02-07 02:18:00,26272,Based on formulation.. that might reduce me to $7500..... $5250 if I could claim the entire parcel. Not worth the cost of livestock insurance to deal with a herd of cattle. Now goats.. might keep the grass cut... lol
835001,BillM,2014-02-07 02:20:00,17367,"Wayne, fence in all those turkeys!  lol!"
835067,aplumma,2014-02-07 12:56:00,6896,Goats are not good for field clearing now fence lines yes. Get sheep for pastures nice cuts without tearing out the roots like horses and mules.    Art
835097,irishfield,2014-02-07 15:29:00,26272,"I can't have sheep Art... too many of the guys on here would want the OFC parties held here...  As I noted previously fisherman7.. check each municipalities website and find their mill rate and see which one better suits the financial situation. There is a huge difference from place to place thanks to the mill rate being pretty much based on the average home. As an example... in the town of Penetang for instance the average house cost is under $150k for the main town core, so they try to get 2 grand each out of those for taxes. So that leaves a $900K water front to pay 6 times that or around $12,000/yr. We have no ""in town / out of town"" rate differential, all pay the same.... where as if you were in Temagami you pay the full mill rate to be in town and anyone that is outside the town limits in the municipality only pay 1/2 the mill rate. So a $200k house in town pays the same taxes as a $400K house out of town. Not many do that, but they're out there.. Where I am right now use to be Tay Township... but we got screwed when we were amalgamated into the town of Penetang, with a 43% tax rise the day it happened."

We are at that point where swimming isn't a big deal for us anymore but it is still nice to be on the water and waterfront property is a good investment (with very few exceptions they just aren't making any more of it).  If you do decide to come up this way, there are a lot more factors that you need to take into consideration; septic systems, wells (flow, recovery, water condition) and I'd be happy to sit down with you and share some of what we have learned!

834425,fisherman7,2014-02-04 12:49:00,325,"I have a lot of respect for the opinion of the members of this board.  My wife and I are about 2 years away from our dream of retiring to a waterfront property but we can't decide between either the Chemong/Buckhorn lakes chain or Sparrow Lake/Port Severn/Honey Harbour area.  Chemong/Buckhorn has great affordable waterfront communities and easy access to the 401 but I'm a little concerned about the blue/green algae in Pigeon and maybe will get to Chemong and Buckhorn.  Sparrow Lake/Port Severn/Honey Harbour - I like the area, it has great fishing but the homes are more expensive and access to the GTA is on the very busy hwy 400.  So, opinions anyone? If the blue/green algae wasn't an issue I'd head for Chemong or Buckhorn.  Thanks in advance."
834426,fishing n autograph,2014-02-04 13:08:00,2540,If money was the issue I would choose the kawarthas

The algae is nothing to worry about. Dont let that scare you away. Never heard of it on chemong or buckhorn anyways.  You'll get more value for your money in the kawarthas too. I cant believe the prices of homes/cottages in muskoka. You could get a home with 100 acres here for the price of a dive in muskoka. Muskoka is catered to the city slickers.  S."
834428,lew,2014-02-04 13:14:00,12766,"I'm retired and live about 10 miles east of Chemong at Clear Lake and would highly recommend this area to anyone. I don't fish the tri-lakes nearly as much as I used to but always enjoy them when I do. I don't find the algae to be a problem at all and wouldn't be the least bit concerned about it, but that's just my opinion.  You'll be close to Peterboro and they have most things anybody could want.  And if you settle in Buckhorn, Cody Inn has about the best Chinese food around"

Absolutely loved it. Surrounded by water and just about everyone you came across was friendly and helpful. Fantastic area to wind down and enjoy the sunset of your years.  Kawarthas all the way.
834437,porkpie,2014-02-04 14:14:00,2521,"Buckhorn without hesitation.  I have spent many a fun filled trip in the area, and on lower buck.  It is one of my favorite destinations.  Muskokas not so much!"

834448,adempsey,2014-02-04 15:09:00,1498,"I'd start looking at the properties first.   You've narrowed down your regions enough IMO to start to check some places out.   I think once you start comparing all the factors like price, property lines, population density, accessibility, building regulations, waterfront regulations, elevation, water source etc.. that will likely make you decide  where to focus on more.    Although, personally I'd have a hard time narrowing it down as much as you already have.   There are far too many nice lakes to consider!  Especially around Haliburton, Bancroft/Maynooth, and the Rideau Lakes.  There's a lot of appeal to the Kawarthas, but I wouldn't overlook the Muskokas.  Although, Muskokas has a reputation for being more expensive and full of us ""city slickers"" [or is it citidiots?], I bet there are some really nice hidden gems to be found.  I am not sure what to think about the blue-green algae blooms that have occurred in the past couple of years.   It's generally a natural phenomenon in these eutrophic lakes when the weather gets really hot [and in still water].    However, if it becomes a stigma it may affect your property value [or you can get a real bargain!].  Is it something to worry about, I don't know.   I suppose that depends on the future weather."
834449,BillM,2014-02-04 15:21:00,17367,I don't think you can go wrong with either.
834450,darsky,2014-02-04 15:23:00,586,North of Kawarthas is very nice too-Apsley area. A bit more rustic and less populated. I found many Kawartha lakes to be shoulder to shoulder with homes-esp Pigeon.

By mid summer I will not go swimming at the public beach because it is so gross.  If swimming is something that is real important to you I would not be looking at either of these lakes. I can't comment on the rest of the Kawartha's as I have no firsthand knowledge of the algae concerns/problems there.

Yup, the municapal offices in cottage areas get pretty creative on ways to empty your pockets!
