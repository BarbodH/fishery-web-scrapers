835897,Angler management,2014-02-12 02:35:00,280,"I know Quinte is always considered unstable, but wondering if this two decade record ice on great lakes this year made safe for a snowmobile?"
835899,Gerritt,2014-02-12 03:14:00,6129,No ice is safe ice.... That said quinte is huge and while one place may be safe another may not be. Perhaps if u were more specific on the location we may be able to give u more of a specific answer.
835904,Sinker,2014-02-12 03:43:00,8692,"There are trucks driving out there in places, but if you dont know where your going, dont go.  Quinte has sketchy ice in a lot of areas at the best of times.  S."
835906,gino,2014-02-12 03:49:00,400,"not to mention the huge amount of snow and slush that is everywhere  ...makes walking a hard task, sleds only..."
835920,Angler management,2014-02-12 12:20:00,280,Hoping to get out this weekend around Trident pt. hoping somebody is familiar with the area and has been recently.
835922,Sinker,2014-02-12 13:15:00,8692,You'll be fine there. Where you getting on the ice? Feel free to stop and give me a ride out. I'll be the guy in the floater suit dragging a clam....having a heart attack LOL  S.
835929,mattybculp,2014-02-12 14:19:00,388,HAHAHAHAHA ! ^^^^^^^^^^^  That literally made me burst out laughing ! Priceless!
835957,Angler management,2014-02-12 16:31:00,280,Hahahaha im sure after this thread every person on BOQ will match your description and be waving to the passing sled. Lol
835992,DOS,2014-02-12 18:06:00,119,"Just got back, last year we had 6"" of ice and that was good ice.  This year 21"", quads are all but usless because how deep the snow is on the ice, walking almost killed me and my cousin trying to drag the Chapelle out.  You will be fine with a sled almost anywhere"
835993,Joeytier,2014-02-12 18:13:00,3990,Certain areas of the bay like Big Bay and Potter's have safe ice for sleds just about every year
836111,Sinker,2014-02-13 03:02:00,8692,"Just got back. Your good to go on a sled. There is some slush, but a lot of it has a crust on it now. Theres a good trail out, but off the trail is nasty in spots. Didnt see any quads, just sleds.  Lost 1 fish, and had a few lookers. Pretty quiet night.  S."
836114,Angler management,2014-02-13 03:09:00,280,"Thanks for the info! I will be heading out on Sunday with a few buddies, hopefully we can locate the fish. I only make a couple trips a year up there and lately havent had the best results. Lol"
836124,Sinker,2014-02-13 04:01:00,8692,"The bays is always hit or miss. Its not where you fish, but when. This weekend has a good moon, so im fishing it all weekend.  S."
