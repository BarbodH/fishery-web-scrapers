I was working in Hamilton and the wife wanted nothing to do with living downtown. This was 5 years ago now. I'm actually glad it happened. I made a promise to myself to never be that broke again, and now we are buying our first house in a few months. Good for you, at the end of the year you have 12 cheques to show for it. If you don't have an agent PM me and I can recommend a great agent in Hamilton. All she sells are working mans homes, no McMansions and I know she will get you the best deal possible. I wish I knew you were in the market, she just sold Mom and Dad's home in Rosedale and the young couple that bought that place have a solid well maintained home."

836072,Canuck2fan,2014-02-13 00:48:00,1444,"Cliff, even if you are fortunate, and play the game just like you were told, you still get screwed. Banks and governments just change the rules. Remember when the government promoted  GIC's by making them tax free ?? The tories changed that in a hurry, and it cost folks a lot of money when they went to cash in on retirement.  Your  pensions are now only as secure as the government allows. I'm not the only person to lose a pension because of a government loophole. The Black's reneged on 50% of their Dominion Store employees pension when they sold out to A&P a few decades back. Too bad we can't cut a politician's pension in half. Government loophole made it legal.  bigugli,  I understand exactly what you are saying about the rules favouring the rich, the politicans and Bay Street. I am the executor for an estate where the only remaining thing to be settled is a pension from a company that went bankrupt. In a nutshell the employees for that company were told if they contributed to the pension fund they would receive a lower hourly wage but would get the tax benefits of an RSP and have a retirement pension.  The person died SEVEN years ago and we still can't close the estate because the damn lawyers and accountants responsible for dividing up the assets haven't spent it all yet. For 3 yrs we have been told next year everything will be settled and you will get the money, each year though there is less and less money that hasn't been eaten up LOL.  Now 2 of the beneficiaries of the will have passed away as well. It is under provincial control and the MPP's staff says they are sorry and they have many others from the same company who are still alive and NEED the money complaining too. Unfortunately, there is nothing they can do to speed up the process. It has been farmed out to a firm specializing in resolving these types of things, because the Harris guberment had decided their friends could do things better in a private company than the government could... SERIOUSLY, it was an arm of the same damn firm specializing in setting these types of pension schemes up that allowed the company to spend the employees pension money instead of putting it a proper trust in the first place...  So in short just because someone does follow the rules and put that 10% of their income away doesn't mean when they need it, it will be there for them...."

So, you'd rather vote for the Liberals and their Green Energy Act, which has caused hydro rates to rise and will likely double in the next 10 years? Or maybe it's the $1,100,000,000 waste of taxpayers money (gas plant scandal) that makes people so fond of the Liberals?    The fact is many people have switched to propane because of the rising hydro prices and now those people are screwed because propane prices are rising too. With the typical high cost of having a propane system installed, those people have no choice but to bend over and pay the high propane prices.  The real question here is if there is an actual shortage of propane due to such a cold winter across North America and more people switching to propane heating, or is this simply a scam in order to jack the prices? Unfortunately, i'm thinking it's very similar to gas prices in that they're simply jacking the prices for a while and will lower the price in the future, which will still be higher than the pre spike price, to make people think they're getting a bargain."

What about the people that worked in support industries to make sure that others prospered, what about the little guy, the book keepers that took jobs so they could feed their families and make someone else rich?

Travel a bit, not to some resort in the Caribbean, to downtown Kingston Jamaica for example or a ghetto in Rio, Budapest, St. Petersburg Russia or Kouzestan Iran, then come home and kiss the frozen ground here in Canada.

Vote them out to vote in a different bunch of doe heads. But regardless and granted there isn't much to choose from we all must vote.

835533,Old Ironmaker,2014-02-10 16:39:00,8243,"I find it difficult to believe that there are no social programs out there to assist those that are making a choice to freeze to death or starve to death. A few years ago I met a guy that was out of work and his EI had run out. This isn't a drug user or alcoholic this was a construction worker that was off work like thousands of others and got behind the 8 ball. No car, no cable, no internet, a $500.00 a month basement apt., no frills. Friends of his came to me to see what if anything I could do to help. I went to Dianne Finlay's office our MP and armed with a pile of outstanding bills, his EI papers and T4 from the previous years showing he was up until then a taxpaying citizen for the previous 30 years and showed her riding assistant. The first thing she did was set up a meeting with the local welfare office. His heat was back on within 2 days, his cupboard was stocked with staples from the local food bank, he received basic budgeting skills, they worked with his landlord and caught him up on rent. The boys sealed some the leaks and added some insulation in his small apartment. He drew welfare until he was called back to work and he hated it. It was just enough to pay the rent, keep the heat on at 62F and some lights on. He hated it. This was a proud guy that never thought he would need social assistance and was too proud to ask for help.  I don't know where you got that info from Big Cliff but I find it hard to believe. Say what you want about our Gov., but no one is going to starve to death in Canada or freeze to death that asks for help and deserves it or not. All those that were on EI and ran out of benefits don't all end up on the streets begging for food and shelter. Those that are homeless are there mainly because of mental health issues, choose not to go on social assistance, or are using their social assistance to feed alcoholism and or a drug habit. That is a simplification I know but this is a fishing forum and I need to be somewhere shortly.  Something is amiss here. There is help out there."

I have a 70 year old cousin who was born into welfare and just stayed on it forever. She had 6 kids by 6 different men and was never married and never worked a single day in her entire life. She just sat back collecting her welfare and the more kids she had, the more money she got.  I was never unemployed a single day in my entire life, from the day I left school until the day I retired, and she  told me I was nothing but a damned sucker for working all the time and paying taxes.  If someone needs a helping hand till they get back on their feet, lets give it to them, but lets also get rid of the garbage like my cousin who do as little as they can to get as much as they can for free."

For the older generation, I do not know what to suggest.West Niagara is blessed with two of the best support organizations/foodbanks in the country. They support over 1000 families in need. Folks are going to have to relearn old skills and learn to be adaptable and creative once again. I am fortunate in having been taught many old world skills. I will be relying on them a little more, and trying to impart that knowledge to my children, nieces, nephews, and the generation now being born.  I've heard that 10% retirement saving goal before. It's not realistic living on minimum wage and spending upwards of 60% of income on rent. Not realistic for those on a fixed income.  I followed that rule and had 2 different pension funds. Thanks to government created loopholes. One employer was allowed to borrow against the company pension. The company folded and so did the pension. With the stock collapse a few years back, my locked in RRSP, taken out from another past employer in trouble, lost 70% of its value overnight. First news of the mess was that all payments from the RRSP fund was being suspended until such time as the fund recovered sufficiently. Those already drawing on that pension were cut off for almost 5 years. They have only now started paying out again. I guess enough of the previous recipients had died off.

We're being hosed at every turn... I could have had him put the same fuel in the tractor's tank beside the hangar for 15 cents less a litre as ""coloured diesel"". Makes no sense.  Hydro bill yesterday.. $808.32..  and last months $836 ...same usage just 4 years ago would have been around $500 with a yearly average of about $5500. Now with time of use.. the doubling of the actual usage bill with ""delivery"" (that use to be $17.95/month fixed) I'm looking at $8k years now for hydro alone.

What you think you own whether it be monetary or not isn't worth the paper that states so. Get it?  How far does your dollar go as days pass?
