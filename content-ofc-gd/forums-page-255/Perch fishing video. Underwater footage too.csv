836350,jbailey,2014-02-14 14:40:00,866,haha love watching them get plucked from the school like they are being beamed up into space!
836356,crappieperchhunter,2014-02-14 15:32:00,2582,Thx for sharing. Loved it.
836361,Freshtrax,2014-02-14 16:25:00,2215,Nice. Love it.
836387,Old Ironmaker,2014-02-14 20:15:00,8243,"Fantastic, keep up the good work. Great production values, and not a single Rappala, Canadian Tire or Cooper tire commercial to be found!  I think I saw one fish have the jig bounce off it's noggin a few times, cool. There sure are a few fish down there. Did you use the camera to find that hot spot or are you just that good, or lucky?"
836404,woodenboater,2014-02-14 22:40:00,2277,great underwater view and LOVE the express elevator ride to the penthouse for the unlucky perch lol
836406,turtle,2014-02-14 22:43:00,274,"Nice video. Perch fishing is fun when they're biting like that.  Crazy to think, for southern Ontario anyway, we've already had a 2 month ice fishing season."
836416,misfish,2014-02-14 23:37:00,29133,"That was so sweet.  Didnt get to watch til I got home. Funny how the rest of the pack dosent even flicker,when you yank one of them out of the pack.  I do like the pan heater thing you got rigged over the burner. Care to share a pic of it? I love my over stuffed ravies.."
836417,Musky or Specks,2014-02-14 23:45:00,2710,Great video thanks
836420,davey buoy,2014-02-14 23:53:00,5505,"Great video,I see no shortage of Perch any time soon lol..They have to be the rabbits of the fish world !!"
836430,BFSC Kevin,2014-02-15 00:45:00,1351,Thanks all.  Forgot to mention to watch it in HD!  I guess the fish were just everywhere
836431,BFSC Kevin,2014-02-15 00:48:00,1351,"Brian,  it's the heater itself.  This one I didn't have to add mods.  I just had to turn it facing up so I have a surface to cook/reheat my food.  I think my heater is called a Coleman BlackCat Catalytic heater."
836432,misfish,2014-02-15 00:56:00,29133,. Looked like a burner under a flat pan in the vid..  Thanks Kevin
836438,bigugli,2014-02-15 01:39:00,6138,"Those vids were great. There used to be another member who used to put up great underwater perch videos.  What was his name... Brian, do you remember who..."
836442,Ice Fishing Ham,2014-02-15 01:54:00,83,"Nice video, looks like you had lots of fun as well."
836450,Joey,2014-02-15 02:16:00,9122,Great vid!
836452,ctranter,2014-02-15 02:22:00,543,The underwater footage was with your gopro right? How did u rig it? Did you weight it underneath to keep the cam steady? Thx!
836476,BFSC Kevin,2014-02-15 06:09:00,1351,"Hey Chris, it was with a go pro. It was attached to a tripod that was weighed down and got sent down the hole."
836483,limeyangler,2014-02-15 10:06:00,5204,Great Video!
