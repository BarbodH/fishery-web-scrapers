The show seemed a little smaller this year than in years past, and not really a ton of deals, unless you're looking for a cheap spinning reel or rod - and I really missed the Tightlines booth.Could always count on them for some trolling deals."
835565,musky_hunter,2014-02-10 20:09:00,328,Cabin fever at the max............really looking forward to this show. Who's going?  http://springfishingandboatshow.com/

835570,Handlebarz,2014-02-10 20:32:00,3790,I will be there Sunday with my wife for musky Sunday. It should be a great time. We are also donating 200 beer koozies for the first people that come into musky Sunday.  I am looking forward to the day great speakers plus there will be some great booths with musky lures. I'm also looking at upgrading my casting rods.  Stop by the muskies Canada booth between 1-3 we will be working it then plus we will be chatting about our lures and musky fishing in general from 8-12 in the musky Sunday area.    
835580,Steve,2014-02-10 21:42:00,2075,the REAL fishing show.  not run by the slimeball walter.
835588,mosquito,2014-02-10 22:36:00,111,"Always a good idea to check out events for things like this....  http://springfishingandboatshow.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/2014-SFBS-2-Off-Coupon-for-Web.jpg    Less than the sportsman show, no parking costs and no drive into Toronto..... I will have to see if I can get there!"
835595,Salmonidstalker,2014-02-10 22:53:00,265,Tell us how you really feel...lol
835612,Entropy,2014-02-11 01:08:00,747,"Hey, Mississauga is Toronto isn't it?"
835615,grizzlybri,2014-02-11 01:19:00,565,"Hey, Mississauga is Toronto isn't it?  Nope Mississauga is not part of Toronto, thank goodness. They are Peel Region"
835623,BillM,2014-02-11 01:28:00,17367,"I remember the Internation Centre venue as a kid, those were the days!   Hopefully this years show is decent, I think I'll bring the old man down."
835625,Entropy,2014-02-11 01:31:00,747,"Was thinking about going Friday after work, but now see it is past hwy 400.  Think that is going to be way too far.  Almost feels like the Sportsmen show was closer to me.  Friday at 4 pm = traffic = not for me.  Was it once held in Scarborough, once, many years ago?  Entropy"
835626,Handlebarz,2014-02-11 01:34:00,3790,It's only about 7 min from the 401/400 It has been at the international centre for many years I think it was 14 years ago when I first took the wife there and maybe that long ago when we had the OFC G2G there that was a good time

Entropy  I don't ever recall having a show in Scarborough.  There were a few shows in Pickering though; that is probably what you were thinking of.  The old Pickering Flea market location hosting some fishing shows in past years.  That location is now a shopping centre.  I don't think the new flea market location has ever been used for a show.  I think the person who is organizing the current Spring Fishing show may have been one of the ones who organized some of the Pickering shows."
835642,BillM,2014-02-11 02:47:00,17367,"400, 401, 409 boom you're there.  (Depending on where you are coming from of course)"

835860,Christopheraaron,2014-02-11 23:24:00,3525,"Sounds awesome Chris guys have been bugging me to try fly fishing for them I just don't want to buy another fly rod and reel. But they might work for gar down here. I'll see if I can come up with a special couple flies for you, you usually fish with something around a foot right?"
835865,Handlebarz,2014-02-11 23:50:00,3790,"Yes 9-12"" would be awesome btw if I end up buying a fly rod and reel for musky fishing because of you I'm gonna kick your butt."

835869,Handlebarz,2014-02-12 00:13:00,3790,Yeah that would be great and how about pink/chartuesse
835870,Christopheraaron,2014-02-12 00:17:00,3525,"No problem, I'll see what I can come up with, still have to pick out a pattern."
835888,Handlebarz,2014-02-12 01:33:00,3790,I have been going over a great thread on the MCI site about fly fishing musky it has alot of great info on rods and reels line and flies. My brain keeps turning. I will wait and see how much I spend at the St.Criox booth this weekend after all it is valentines weekend and my wife needs a new fly rod
