835734,Christopheraaron,2014-02-11 17:55:00,3525,"I looked into hosting a booth at the Sportsman Show this year. Bloody expensive! Almost $1500 for a 10' x 10' plus tax, plus other setup expenses!  I was in Fort Myers last week for the Florida Sportsman expo, and it was only $600, and wifi and electricity $15 for the 2 days!  So, I'm setting up at the Spring Fishing & Boating show instead. Half the price (with a half-booth option), and free parking!  Plus, Bob Izumi and Dave Mercer will be there Izumi was at the last show too....  But I am looking forward to seeing Mercer"

Not the big showy splash of the big Toronto shows, but affordable, with deals to be had, and supports your small local businesses.   I have a small local business. Would be interested to know which of these indie shows are appealing to local anglers.  Btw, if anyone stops by my booth, ask for Shaun. Would be great to meet you guys."
835251,Old Ironmaker,2014-02-08 03:50:00,8243,"After I said 23 years ago I would never go back to the ""Want to build a Mansion in Muskoka Show "" oops I mean Sportsman show I succumbed to peer pressure and went back. I was right 23 years ago. Let's see 20 bucks to park, 25 for the opportunity to go shopping, another 125 in fuel, and that's Rez price. A hot dog for 8 bucks, I didn't even look to see what a 10 dollar draught beer looks like, please, come on man. Bass Pro, Sail Store or Gander Mountain even provides free parking.  The days of walking around and filling bags of free swag are long gone. For some that weren't alive in the 70's you could walk around and fill bags full of lures, line, terminal tackle, discount cards for fish camps. I had the first Ultralight rod and reel in the gang, $5.00, I payed $5.00 and still use it. We saw some great demonstrations by pro's from the dogs to getting bombed with good old Red Fisher. You didn't need to drink with him to get a buzz, just smelling his breath would get you tipsy. A new skinny kid with hair doing trick casts into the giant aquarium, what was his name??????? Bob Isuzu or something, nice kid. But we told him get a day job, no one is going to pay you to fish for a living for goodness sakes, his brother was there too, tall guy, he was telling him the same thing. That's a true story. My buddy knew them from Waterdown I think.  Save your money, stay away in my opinion, save it for the fishing show. I  knew I should have stayed home, could have out that money towards a new rod and reel."
835252,craigdritchie,2014-02-08 03:55:00,1586,"     Nice idea, but if you bring the vendors in at no charge, how do you cover the cost of renting the Direct Energy Centre for a week? Do you any idea what that costs?  How do you cover the cost of temporary event insurance, temporary event staffing (including all the parking lot attendants, cleaners, people in ticket booths ... they may work for the CNE but for that week, you're paying their salaries) ... not to mention electricty, carpet rentals for the aisles, facilities charges, security, advertising/marketing ... none of that stuff is free you know. It doesn't take long till that five day show costs well over a half-million bucks before you've even opened the doors.  And when you do open up, you better hope attendance is good because you have exactly five days to make enough money to pay all of your company's bills and all of your staff salaries for the rest of the year.  Still think it's a ""cash grab from top to bottom?""  Shows are expensive business. But they're good entertainment."
835259,Old Ironmaker,2014-02-08 04:33:00,8243,"Exactly what venture isn't a cash grab? That's the idea behind our system of capitalism, getting the most sales revenue coupled with minimal cost and demanding the highest price the market will bear in order to maximize profit. I wouldn't want to be the CEO of a company telling the board ""well ladies and gentlemen we could have made more money but we wanted to give the consumer a break this quarter."" Oh I'm fired, wow, may I ask as to why?  Heck young Christopher K knows that.  In times where demand exceeds supply the formula was COST PLUS PROFIT = PRICE, now its PRICE MINUS COST =PROFIT OR LOSS."

I have never fly fished before & found the demo quite informative - going to try it.  A lot of vendors for tackle - did not really check any pricing as I prefer to support my local shop here in London. (Lambeth Rod & Tackle)  Certainly drooled alitlle at some of the boats...  Nice to see all the outfitters available & got to meet Martin & Jennifer from outpostcamps.com in person.  Mr. Borger is quite the celebrity- I saw his picture in a few booths.

Which had a better/cleaner DI  and better processor ?  I had asked the Humminbird rep and he said I should be talking to the Lowrance rep.. Funny and actually surprised he said that the BIRD was a better unit...  Quicker processor and was a full HD unit...  The Lowrance wasn't HD...

It is definitely getting smaller from years gone by but was still a nice little escape from a cold hard winter. It is getting quite expensive though and not much in the way of freebies given out other than the odd food sample. I did get a free lure when I was renewing my fishing license which I will probably never use but still a better day than what I was expecting but not by much.  Kawartha Kev

A few years ago Miller banned guns from Toronto owned properties.  The Sportsman Show moved to the Convention Centre (which is owned by the province).  With Miller out of the picture, the Sportsman Show was able to move back to the Exhibition.  I have heard that there traditional March time slot has already been taken by another show.  Thus, the Sportsman Show had to find a new time slot.  The time slot that they chose happens to occur the week before the Spring Fishing Show.  The time slot they chose may have been partly or entirely an attempt to take the business away from the other show."

I can't wait to get out and chat about musky fishing with everyone. Doors open at 7:30 the show starts at 8 and runs to 12. Please stop by and say hi. I will also be working the muskies Canada booth from 1-3pm with my wife.  I had looked into getting a booth at the show but the cost of the booth then add in the hotels meals plus loss of two days wage I could not justify it. I would love to do some of these shows and it would be great to have more small guys there as I know the musky guys love the odyssey and getting to talk with the bait makers and I totally love to chat about fishing and hearing the stories from my customers.
