The scientist walked down to the river with lots of children splashing in the water  on a hot summer day.  As he approached the shore, his Geiger Counter (measures radiation) went from  tick, tick - to screaming .  The government assured the residents that all was safe even in the face of huge levels of cancer amoungst the people.  Not sure if things have changed for the better."
