835407,Big Cliff,2014-02-09 16:14:00,6899,"Don't think I can help much with the pictures thing as our hard drive crashed about a year ago and we lost everything. I bet Tyler's mom would be able to help her though.  Perhaps one of our local computer gurus could give her a call and help her set things up so she can access the OFC board again, I for one miss her input!"
