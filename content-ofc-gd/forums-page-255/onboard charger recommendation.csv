835921,Cosmos,2014-02-12 13:11:00,588,"Hi Guys,  Looking to get 1 bank onboard charger. Would like to know which one to buy. I was thinking about MinnKota 110D, but I don't mind to get something different.  Any advice would be appreciated Thanks"
835923,lew,2014-02-12 13:38:00,12766,Guest 2611 would be my choice
835925,Lape0019,2014-02-12 13:45:00,647,"My father has had a 110D for a while now and really likes it. The 10 amps charges the battery pretty quick.  I have a 330 as well and it works just as well. after a day on the water, I can plug it in and within 3 hours, my batteries are topped up and ready for the next outing. My batteries are usually only ever drained to half on a full day of fishing to give you an idea of what you would be looking for."

835931,lew,2014-02-12 14:23:00,12766," I got the recommendation from Lew and a few other guys here,   I bought the Guest 2611 back in '99 and it's still going strong 15 years later for the 2nd owner of the boat.  They make a great charger."
835938,Roy,2014-02-12 14:52:00,13728,Guest here as well....been going strong since I bought it 7 or so years ago.
836010,Cosmos,2014-02-12 19:27:00,588,Thanks guys. Will check Guest chargers.

836023,Cosmos,2014-02-12 20:19:00,588,"Following your advise I found this one, price is great:  http://www.amazon.com/Guest-2611A-Battery-Charger-24-Volt/dp/B000NHZV1S/ref=sr_1_1?s=sporting-goods&ie=UTF8&qid=1392233966&sr=1-1&keywords=Guest+1+bank+Marine+Battery+Charger  I need 1 bank charger and this one has 2 set of cables, what do I need to do with another set, which I am not going to use? if I leave it unplugged what will happen once I will put battery on charge?"
836026,Cosmos,2014-02-12 20:27:00,588,Also would like to know opinion on that one: http://www.amazon.com/Guest-16102-Marine-Battery-Charger/dp/B000NUYZCQ/ref=sr_1_3?s=sporting-goods&ie=UTF8&qid=1392236792&sr=1-3&keywords=Guest+Marine+Battery+Charger
836062,aplumma,2014-02-12 23:05:00,6896,you can use just one of the leads. The other one remove the fuse and tape up the end and hang out of any weather or water contact.   Art
836071,BillM,2014-02-13 00:40:00,17367,"You'll eventually get a 24V motor, just leave the other lead wrapped up until you do"
836151,Cosmos,2014-02-13 12:40:00,588,Thank you guys   Any good words about ProMariner chargers?
836222,Flippin-Jig,2014-02-13 18:05:00,29,I've had a few chargers in my bass boats over the years.  I have had Guest and Minn Kota Chargers that died or lost a bank.  None of the chargers  were as good as or as durable as the Dual Pro Charger I currently have.  A few friends have the same charger in their boats and they too have been going strong for a few years.
836706,fish_fishburn,2014-02-16 21:31:00,1311,I can vouch for the dual pro. its been im my boat since 96 without any issues.
