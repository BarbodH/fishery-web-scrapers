836718,lew,2014-02-16 22:57:00,12766,I've been waiting for this big guy to shed his antlers and he dropped the 1st one sometime yesterday. I wandered thru the woods looking for it today but didn't find it. Maybe I'll find the 2nd one when it drops.  This is him in my yard a couple days ago    And this was this afternoon.  
836723,4x4bassin,2014-02-16 23:10:00,1025,"That's great Lew , wish you luck on finding them . Might be a bit easier just after the snow melts though . That buck looks like a real hell raiser by looking at those tines I am always on the lookout for sheds come the spring , cut the small ones up and give them to the dog . She loves them !"
836728,lew,2014-02-16 23:26:00,12766,"That buck looks like a real hell raiser by looking at those tines  He's got a harem of about 14 ladies with him most days but I never see another buck around, although 'm sure there's others in the neighborhood for him to scrap with."
836732,GBW,2014-02-16 23:53:00,8460,He's Da-Buck of the area for sure!  HAHA Good luck Lew on your walks finding it.

836785,Joey,2014-02-17 03:58:00,9122,"Good luck Lew, hope you find it."

836793,danc,2014-02-17 05:16:00,4677,Very nice Lew. I got a similar shot a couple of years ago. There's probably a very small time frame to photograph a one antlered buck.  
836797,fishindevil,2014-02-17 08:15:00,6254,Great pics guys !!!! Wow ... Hope you find it and the one he is about to drop !!!! Cool
836805,lew,2014-02-17 13:17:00,12766,"Don't look on the ground exclusively look about antler high as well,thats where I have found most of my sheds-still in a tree...  vance  Those broken tines on the remaining antler weren't like that a few days ago and I'm wondering if they actually use the trees as leverage to break them loose ??  I think  I'll take a wander along their trails thru the woods today and see if I can locate the missing antler.  Dan, that's a great picture."
