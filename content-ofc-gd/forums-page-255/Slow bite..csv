Not so for the last 3 winters. Rumours are its being netted, but until I meet the man with his nets I won't speculate.  Anyway…got one 14"" and one 17"" which will be enough for lunch at the iceshack today. first pic of the tourney entry was blurred…had to wait till this morning to try again….lol.    14""er      Two shots of the same 17""er   "

""Just a reminder that teams should only be using the given OFC 2014 sign this year, no banners or homemade signs will be accepted from here on in.""  I guess you will have to latch in to one of the 30""ers out there..  I'm sure you will!"
