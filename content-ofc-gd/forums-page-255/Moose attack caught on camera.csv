836473,Old Ironmaker,2014-02-15 05:12:00,8243,"She was on the way to the mall. Plus there are moose standing around waiting for the bus everyday there. What I don't get is what the conservation officers take on it was.  You can see in the video that it's between a house and a vehicle, and our take on it is that the moose felt it needed to get out of there. It was being cornered, and the easiest way out happened to be over top of this individual.""  The easiest way was to be over top of this individual?  There sure was more room behind her. She gave her a shot and walked away, didn't look to be cornered to me. More like hey lady no one says hello anymore?"
