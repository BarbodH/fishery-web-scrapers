I have not fished this area before and was wondering if anyone had any feedback?  Cheers  Not real familiar with the Montreal, but I can offer you some thoughts. With an expected late spring and super cold water temps, there are 2 hard and fast rules to follow when it comes to walleye on the opener.  1.Water temp is key, find the warmest water in the system and you'll probably find fish. Even a difference of 2-3 degrees is enough to trigger fish.  2.Fish will almost certainly be shallow. I regularly fish 4-8' depths this time of year."
