839122,Handlebarz,2014-03-01 12:44:00,3790,Well I was very excited this week when I was able to get the newest issue of Outdoor Canada magazine and see that Handlebarz musky lures was tied for 5th place in there 25 top gear to have for 2014. I knew that we had made the list top 25 gear for 2014 but had no clue it was 5th until this week and to top it off were part of the centerfold I think this is how Pam Anderson got her start LOL.  I again do have to thank all of the OFC family for the help along the way we will always be great full for this place as I have made so many TRUE friends that will be with me for life. This place is more then just a fishing board and that is what makes this so special for me.  Thanks again everyone.
