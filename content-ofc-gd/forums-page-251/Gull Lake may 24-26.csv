Quick fix and on our way! High water and Beaver DamsCamp was set up by 2 PMSomeone came to say hello.Got the boat in the water and set out for some Walleye... All I got were friggin Trout  ! after Trout after Trout ! With the water temps at 41* I was expecting as much. In all caught about 30 ,all free to be caught another day, no Walleye to be had this time 'round.Nature calls Some scenery..All in all we had a great weekend , it got pretty cold in the evenings but there were absolutely no bugs ! and NO INJURIES !!! Randy."
788854,asdve23rveavwa,2013-05-28 15:16:00,2690,"Great report Randy!!  No walleye, but, at least you were catching!  Looks like a great spot to get away to.  I can't wait for our (Juli and I), just the two of us, week away in July."
788858,oldphart,2013-05-28 15:27:00,665,"~~~~Fantastic report, hear Trout cooks up real good, and so does Groose. Love the pic of the water trickling down OOOOPs so got to go"

788906,Muskieman,2013-05-28 17:57:00,2472,"It's my favorite spot period , the last 10 k are brutal and take about 1 1/2 hrs with a 4x4 .. almost guaranteed a good spot to camp , we lucked out and got the best one , there were 3 more camped a out 200 M away ... We had 1/2 the lake to ourselves"
788908,Jds63,2013-05-28 18:12:00,1365,"great report and pics, thanks for sharing"
788919,Sinker,2013-05-28 19:29:00,8692,Looks like a great spot to spend a weekend for sure!  S.
788922,Roy,2013-05-28 19:50:00,13728,"Nevermind the spot, that's a hefty trout you have there! Congrats to you both and thanks for sharing."
788928,ccmtcanada,2013-05-28 20:28:00,7971,"Great report and pics!!  I kept waiting for ""epic"" injury lol.  A flat tire which you were prepared for and the rest of the report was all great!  No walleye but lots of trout is a nice thing too."
788943,camillj,2013-05-28 22:04:00,1988,May not have been any gold in the waters .. but Im thinkin thars gold in them thar hills !  Great report ... and next time cook up some of that laker action !
788946,Muskieman,2013-05-28 22:17:00,2472,"I wasn't gonna cook for myself , Sue doesn't really like Trout ,I'm not really crazy 'bout it either , It's not bad at all on a Cedar Plank or with a good coating in oil , but.. T-Bone and Brisket were on the menu for Friday and Saturday   had I caught a Walleye , it probably would've went back as well."
788970,danc,2013-05-28 23:38:00,4677,Good times I'm sure Randy. Looks like a great weekend to me.
788972,limeyangler,2013-05-28 23:46:00,5204,That looks awesome Randy.  Holy moly....as soon as i saw that first picture i thought 'that's gotta be rough on your gear.....lol a couple pictures later confirmed that.  What a fantastic spot to set up camp.  GREAT REPORT.....  LOVE IT!
788973,davey buoy,2013-05-28 23:49:00,5505,"Looks like a piece of paradise!!,I think I'd be bringing in a couple more spare tires though.lol."
840128,ChrisAshton,2014-03-06 23:21:00,4,Excellent lake. I am planning to go up this May run. How were the roads? My dad actually was able to drive a car in there in the sixties when they were logging. I'm a walleye hunter myself. Any secret places that might like to share at gull lake? I have a couple in mind to try first thing.
840129,ChrisAshton,2014-03-06 23:21:00,4,I really like the pictures you took!
840217,Muskieman,2014-03-07 15:42:00,2472,"Thanks ! Gull is hit and miss , the road is getting worse every year , and I don't mind that one bit .. long gone are the days of getting in with a car , going in with a 2WD truck is taking a risk ."

840454,ChrisAshton,2014-03-09 16:55:00,4,"Randy, are you planning to go this May?"
840464,little mountain,2014-03-09 18:50:00,16,"I have bin to Gull 11 or 12 times now since 2005. the road is rough and i wouldn't try it without 4x4 . the pics Randy has posted is just part of it. I take extra trailer lights and wire and have used them. From the end of 805 u are about 2 hrs in 4x4. but it is just part of the trip. I have never caught a walleye but done well on lakers and lots of small mouth bass. Nice pics , cant wait to go back this fall."
840500,Muskieman,2014-03-10 02:46:00,2472,I'll be going in mid June ..
