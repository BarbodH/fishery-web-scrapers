Downside is, yes, it's generally pretty expensive. If you want that kind of fishing, then that's what it costs. Everything there, from the buildings to the food to the toilet paper, comes in a long way by truck so it isn't cheap. That said, you get what you pay for when it comes to fishing quality. Some other options beside Osprey Lodge include Cree Tourism and Mistassini Lodge.  If it's trophy brookies you want, Mabec Outfitters is another option. They're in a different part of Quebec (St. Lawrence north shore, near Sept Iles). Again, it isn't cheap since it's fly-in only. But if you want to catch a dozen or so brookies over 5 pounds each day, then you'll love it. Been there twice, best brookie so far was a shade over 8 pounds. It's heaven on earth."
