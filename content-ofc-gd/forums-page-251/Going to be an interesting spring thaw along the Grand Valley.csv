The concern is that the snowpack upstream from Bellwood contains some 120 million cubic metres of water, Schultz said.""  Sure hope we get a slow thaw!"
841007,BillM,2014-03-13 13:13:00,17367,Going to be an interesting thaw everywhere this spring I'm guessing.    Water levels this year should be good.
841014,SirCranksalot,2014-03-13 13:55:00,3291,Water levels this year should be good.  I guess it depends on where you are. I expect the lower Notty to be blown pretty well for the duration once the thaw starts in earnest.
841017,BillM,2014-03-13 13:57:00,17367," I guess it depends on where you are. I expect the lower Notty to be blown pretty well for the duration once the thaw starts in earnest.  All of the Notty will be blown, personally I hope it is..   Let the fish do their thing and get back to the lake unmolested."
