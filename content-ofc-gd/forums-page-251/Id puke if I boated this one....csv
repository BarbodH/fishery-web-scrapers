It was so darned big I 1st thought it was a carp while I was netting it.  Took it in a measured it on 3 different scales just to be sure, then we ate ate it for supper.  Things were different back in the day."
840352,glen,2014-03-08 22:00:00,2641,Sick =great to the young ones.
840353,glen,2014-03-08 22:02:00,2641,Lew you didn't eat an 18lber for supper.     That's to much fish to eat for just supper.  Lol.

840356,mike rousseau,2014-03-08 22:41:00,4661,When it's the fish your hunting your entire life and you see it.... You'll get the feeling...  I dropped a giant walleye fishing locally and I got butterflies
840412,darsky,2014-03-09 05:29:00,586,"a fortyfive lb 'ski headshaking violently 36 inches from your shoes can do that too. ""please don't get off please don't get off please don't get off"".  she didn't get off."
840414,Walleye72,2014-03-09 05:41:00,156,"I'm trying to understand why anyone would keep a walleye this size?  I would want pictures of course, but to take that fish out of the fishery.  To eat???  Or even mount?  Wow is all I can say.  "
840458,Steve,2014-03-09 17:11:00,2075,"Wow is what i'm hoping people will say when it's on my wall.  16lbs+ = bonk.    Wow is what ""I"" feel when people want purchased plastic on their wall .... each to their own."
840533,Steel Bunny,2014-03-10 15:05:00,46,"dang, we caught some 1-5lbs in the Columbia, return trip may be in order!  many out west anglers consider bass, walleye and pike to be garbage fish, even where they occur naturally and are not invasive...trout and salmon are obviously the only trophy fish  Thats interesting. Many bass fisherman here feel the same way about trout and salmon.  Why would a bass fishermen think trout are garbage fish?"

That fish could make someone's dreams come true...  I don't keep any walleye over 5 lbs (3lb average here) for eating... Boat rule... But that's just me... I know guys that'll eat 10 pounders without even thinking about it... More meat for their limit... Lol... Old school thinking I guess...."
840718,BillM,2014-03-11 15:44:00,17367,"Is a walleye like that even still producing eggs?  It's gotta be old...    Walleyes that big just make me laugh, just giant ugly monsters."

840728,mike rousseau,2014-03-11 16:22:00,4661,What I always wondered about are genetics....  Do big fish produce big fish?  I'm a big fella... Chances are my kids are gunna be fair sized individuals...  Is it the same with fish??? Cause if it is then even if half the eggs are useles... The other half are priceless....
840774,Steve,2014-03-11 22:51:00,2075,i don't concern myself with whether the fish is producing eggs or not...  i just set my standards high...  to many a 10lbs walleye is a wall hanger....each to their own.  16lbs walleye will turn some heads.....myself included.....  that'll go on my wall. skin mount.
840776,BillM,2014-03-11 22:55:00,17367,"I don't think I'd mount anything to be honest, unless it was a world record of some sort, although depending on the fish it might just get a few great pics taken of it and back into the drink it will go."
840777,Steve,2014-03-11 22:57:00,2075,"not me....i'll mount just about any species.  16lbs walleye, 50lbs muskie, 8lbs bass, 25lbs brown, 40lbs king, 30lbs pike, 20lbs rainbow, lots of options out there  just each one is going to be a true trophy, not just a ""nice fish""."

840156,Fisherpete,2014-03-07 01:14:00,1814,WOW  Cheek pouches like pancakes LOL  Not that I would eat them... the mount would look funny

840251,Steve,2014-03-07 18:40:00,2075,I'd love to see a photo of the 18lbs'er....  even if it is just the mount....  that is freaking huge!!!  16lbs is the biggest I've seen in photo or otherwise.  Amazing fish Paul !
840261,Joey,2014-03-07 20:13:00,9122,"Here ya go.  I don't have the pic of him holding it on my work computer, will look at home later  "

840281,mattaw,2014-03-07 22:35:00,162,"Wow, that's a beast of a fish.. Very nice!"
840326,darsky,2014-03-08 15:41:00,586,walleye weights do look deceiving in photos. I dropshotted up a 10 lber near Cornwall once and in my pics it really looks 6-7 lbs tops.
840329,solopaddler,2014-03-08 15:56:00,8605,Nice Zander!
840332,mike rousseau,2014-03-08 16:05:00,4661,Agreed....  It's even worse if you a larger then average person...  The picture above if I didn't know better id estimate the weight 10 pounds or less.... But it's nearly double that....
840336,Joey,2014-03-08 17:56:00,9122,"Ya, it's also the way you hold it.  In the pic of the 20 plus lbr in the link, the guy is holding it out toward the camera, whereas Paul is holding it against his body.  I kind of go by the hands and head size of the fish if possible.  So you look at the guy's hand compared to the tail area where Paul is holding his and you can kind of see what I'm talking about.  Camera's are the pits for good estimates though.  You really need to weigh or take measurements.  The fish actually weighed less when it arrived at the taxidermist's from water weight loss."
840346,misfish,2014-03-08 20:30:00,29133,"Im still trying to  understand the TITLE of this  Why would you PUKE??????  Nice fish indeed. Pauls is very nice as well. I had a pic of my PB on my old PC,caught out off the mouth of the Notty opening day 18 years ago.. 14 lbs,caught on a  vibra fox spinner."
840349,glen,2014-03-08 21:52:00,2641,Because its so sick.
840350,misfish,2014-03-08 21:55:00,29133,Because its so sick.  The fish was sick? Or was the fisherman? Cold/ flu?
