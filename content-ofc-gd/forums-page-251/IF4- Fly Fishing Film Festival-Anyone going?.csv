839701,Tim Mills,2014-03-04 21:30:00,476,Anybody going down to the IF$ Flyfishing Film Festival  Thursday night in TO?  The trailers on WFN look  good.  My son's and I are going.  One's already hooked I'm hoping this will help get the other one back in the game.  http://flyfilmfest.com/IF4/about-if4/   
839707,fish_finder,2014-03-04 22:25:00,370,"Should be a good one this year!  If anyone is considering going and has a teenager or younger son or daughter they'd like to bring, they can get in FREE with a paid adult ticket.  Shoot me a PM for details if that sort of thing interests you!  Dave"
839710,mattaw,2014-03-04 22:31:00,162,I'm strongly considering going. Just have to find a friend or two that is free that night and I'll be there.
839711,Christopheraaron,2014-03-04 22:42:00,3525,"I'll be there, is that you Kim?"
839712,fish_finder,2014-03-04 22:43:00,370,Getting the word out for Kim about the free seats for youth.  Kim's a good buddy of mine.
839930,Steel Bunny,2014-03-05 22:41:00,46,Should I be worried that this might sell out? lol...
839931,Steel Bunny,2014-03-05 22:43:00,46,I just bought two tickets....phew....  
839941,Christopheraaron,2014-03-05 23:05:00,3525,And you guys are sure there will be tickets there?
839980,solopaddler,2014-03-06 01:57:00,8605,Will be going to the one in Waterloo next month.
839981,BassMan11,2014-03-06 02:06:00,583,I was wondering about this. What happens to the videos from last year? Is there anywhere to view them online? The video where they were fly fishing sheefish looked really awesome.
839990,BillM,2014-03-06 02:20:00,17367,Do I need to bring a spey rod in order to be allowed in?  
839995,Christopheraaron,2014-03-06 02:33:00,3525,"I was wondering about this. What happens to the videos from last year? Is there anywhere to view them online? The video where they were fly fishing sheefish looked really awesome. Don't believe that one made the cut, it's just the winning films, I believe it's landed, small stream addiction, mending the line and arctic silver. If you want to see the others (I really want to see a deliberate life) you should be able to order them online."
840032,fish_finder,2014-03-06 15:08:00,370,"And you guys are sure there will be tickets there?  As long as folks RSVP, there are seats.  That's why I say PM me so you can get a seat reserved for a youth if you have an adult ticket.  Right now, there are plenty of seats still available.  Trailers for the films can be viewed on the homepage of the IF4 website:  http://flyfilmfest.com/IF4/  List of films: "
840039,Christopheraaron,2014-03-06 15:55:00,3525,Pm sent

If you want to see the others (I really want to see a deliberate life) you should be able to order them online. Hey Chris, the one I am talking about is actually from last years festival. I just can't seem to find the full video anywhere. I also believe it won last year.  ""Cast Alaska II - Sheebang"" (Trailer) - Official Selection, IF4 2013 on Vimeo"
840066,MrSimon,2014-03-06 18:11:00,217,It would be great if they would produce a Blu-ray of these films after the fact .... I'd pay a pretty penny for that.
840069,fish_finder,2014-03-06 19:09:00,370,"They used to sell the dvds and blurays right off the IF4 website but there wasn't enough interest to carry on.  Most of the films are available either in DVD/Bluray format or for streaming/On Demand on the film makers websites.  Just search the film maker and video name and google and you should be able to find them.  For anyone interested, the one we had in the festival in 2012 is free to view on youtube:"
840171,emjay88,2014-03-07 05:04:00,70,A great show tonight!!! Love watching fishing docs in that kind of environment!  My vote for favourite vid was definitely the last Mending The Line!  A bit of a tear jerker!
840209,Christopheraaron,2014-03-07 14:57:00,3525,"Mending the line was great, landed was a bit of a let down, destination spain was awful, and I'd put all the others at about average. Good to meet a few people, although I didn't recognize anyone from this board there."
840221,Tim Mills,2014-03-07 15:50:00,476,"All the films were beautifully shot and featured gorgeous scenery and fish.  I agree Mending was well done and a great story.  I also liked Unbroken and thought it would have been interesting to hear more about the family and its business.  Parts of the Eel River film and the Trout Bum film were good too.  The others seemed to be more about blatant product placement and preaching to the choir on conservation than any kind of storyline (trout dvd on the shelf in the background, close-ups of wading boot labels underwater, zooming in to fly reel and rod logo's).  The start of Landed reminded me of Hooking Up on WFN."
840222,Christopheraaron,2014-03-07 16:06:00,3525,I'm sure Remax loved their bit of product placement as well LOL!
840227,BillM,2014-03-07 16:17:00,17367,Sounds like most fishing shows these days unfortunately!
840705,Steel Bunny,2014-03-11 14:15:00,46,A great show tonight!!! Love watching fishing docs in that kind of environment!  My vote for favourite vid was definitely the last Mending The Line!  A bit of a tear jerker!  A bit?  I was balling! lol
