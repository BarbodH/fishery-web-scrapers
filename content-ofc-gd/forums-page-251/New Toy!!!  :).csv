839949,NAC,2014-03-05 23:34:00,369,"Can't say I pegged you for a yakfisher Dave.  Once we put a bit of thought into it, we all know of somewhere they are better suited to than a motorboat or shore fishing.  Have fun!"
839951,DRIFTER_016,2014-03-05 23:45:00,10439,It'll be perfect for some of the smaller lakes as well as our slower rivers back home. Be good for messing around at the cabin too.
839958,Roy,2014-03-06 00:23:00,13728,I dunno Dave...I can kind of imagine you on an Alaskan river with that thing.
