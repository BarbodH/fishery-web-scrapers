839614,mcdougy,2014-03-04 05:00:00,274,Common sense tells me those teenagers don't have any.
839635,jbailey,2014-03-04 13:23:00,866,lol that's one way of becoming a statistic
839636,Steelheadphycho,2014-03-04 13:29:00,470,BRILLIANT!
839642,captpierre,2014-03-04 14:13:00,2521,too narrow a boat/canoe to be doing that....even if it looks like fun
839647,gino,2014-03-04 14:32:00,400,how did they get back to shore? maybe they had some paddles ...i hope..  ...otherwise...he he he
839654,blaque,2014-03-04 15:17:00,2419,Looks like fun to me
839656,BillM,2014-03-04 15:17:00,17367,I probably would have done that when I was a teenager as well.
839658,irishfield,2014-03-04 15:31:00,26272,"There were two smart ones amongst them anyhow.. the guys that let them go.. and yah, I did worse as a teen and even a preteen. We were probably 8 or 9 when we use to dare each other to touch open water on the Rideau.. on the current INTAKE side behind the Mariner Inn!"
839848,Tim Mills,2014-03-05 16:57:00,476,"Impressive but as a parent it makes me nervous.  To them its worth the risk if they get enough ""likes"" on facebook."
839859,Fisherman,2014-03-05 17:37:00,7201,"Who give a hoot about the paddles, you fall into the water wearing those clothes and you sink like a brick."
839978,Gallie,2014-03-06 01:53:00,1215,I hate to say it but i might still take part in that right now...let alone 10-15 years ago when it would have been a guarentee. Might have put a pfd on though
840022,Fisherman,2014-03-06 13:07:00,7201,From Keswick eh...
840152,Gallie,2014-03-07 00:50:00,1215,For better or worse i choose to live here i wasnt born here...
840158,Fisherpete,2014-03-07 01:43:00,1814,"OK, I have been craving to get out on open water - but not like that!"
