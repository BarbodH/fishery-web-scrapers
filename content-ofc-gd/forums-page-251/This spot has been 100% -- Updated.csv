840545,NAW,2014-03-10 15:41:00,4022,I may put my hut there next winter.  If we get some decent ice...
840577,Terry,2014-03-10 18:55:00,14456,yup  lots of ice right now I might need to buy a longer shaft for my auger
840580,misfish,2014-03-10 19:05:00,29133,Very nice Nick.
836534,NAW,2014-02-15 18:56:00,4022,"Second time this season snowshoeing in to this spot.  Very last minute, or I would have had a few others with me.  Just a solo mission today.I found this guy on the walk in.  He must have crashed pretty hard...I wasn't set up and fishing until after 10 am.  Blue Bird sky.  I wasn't getting my hopes up.Testing out a new Christmas present.  A Frabil 38"" heavy action rod.  First bite, I didn't set the hook right.  And I lost the fish.  I'm used to short hydro poles... I was marking some monsters, but they where just coming up for a sniff, then back down. My wife texts me that she's on her way home, that's my que to pack up and leave.  Moments later, one rises up from bottom and dings my williams.No messing around this time.  I set the hook good and hard.  Nothing big, but it's still 16"" toward team 6!!The rod has a real nice feel to it.  I'm gunna try for some big  pike and see how it handles.Home just before 1.  Great way to kick of the long weekend!"
836535,BillM,2014-02-15 19:04:00,17367,Sweet!!!!!!

836622,Rod Caster,2014-02-16 14:05:00,5784,Keep up that record!
836626,BillM,2014-02-16 14:18:00,17367,Nick how was the slush out there?
836691,NAW,2014-02-16 20:45:00,4022,"No where I was.  But on my snowshoes, I never would have noticed anyways."
836746,BillM,2014-02-17 00:24:00,17367,Cool man.
837125,Sinker,2014-02-19 03:51:00,8692,Is that a merganser?? Where the heck did it come from? That's an odd find on the ice for sure!  Nice eye!  S.
837126,nancur373,2014-02-19 03:57:00,1211,Can't make out an auger in that photo but I can see a spud...
837127,irishfield,2014-02-19 04:05:00,26272,Yep.. Nick likes to call the fish in.. chip.. chip.. chip .. damn that's thick.. chip.. chip..chip..
837144,Moosebunk,2014-02-19 07:56:00,3970,Buzzer beater eye!  Nice.  Gotta pick up a heavier stick too.  That Frabill could fit the bill.
837158,NAW,2014-02-19 12:54:00,4022,"Can't make out an auger in that photo but I can see a spud... I spud holes for the work out..  And it's easier on my tendinitis..  Cranking manual augers doen't work for me.  There was only 16"" of crappy soft ice to get through...  Took no time at all!  Hey bunk, so far the Frabil it working great.  But I've yet to tie in to anything really big with it.  Maybe this weekend...Chad..?    I'll let you know how it holds up."
837285,highdrifter,2014-02-19 22:46:00,2534,Nice huck in the bush!!
840494,NAW,2014-03-10 01:50:00,4022,"The stat still stands...  This afternoon I took some friends from work out for an evening bite.  It worked out great, because THEY drove me up in their truck, and THEY provided food and beverages!!!!  One heck of an easy guide job for me!!  I just provided the gear, and hiked it all in and out of the spot.  Baited hooks, froze my fingers off....  But it was worth it.  The one fella is from the rock, so he knows how to fish..  He got the first bite, but lost it half way up.  I wasn't far behind, but I buried it good, and iced a PB for this lake.  22"" and a few more notches in the belt for team 6!  Again with this spot, it was about 10 minutes before we had planned on packing up.  In fact, the one friend was starting to complain about being cold, and so I was just going to finish my beverage, and pack up to leave...  "
840497,BillM,2014-03-10 02:16:00,17367,Nice Nick!  Weather wasn't too bad out today at all
840498,NAW,2014-03-10 02:24:00,4022,"The weather is a funny thing in muskoka this year...  Nice at my house.  Nice hike in...  But 5 minutes after we set up, it turned in to a steady wind and snow fall...  With a nice brisk windchill..."
840499,BillM,2014-03-10 02:39:00,17367,"We were supposed to get something like 4cms today, we got nothing.  I'm willing to bet my parents in Coldwater got some though  Nice fish man, I still gotta pull my first eye out of that lake."
840513,Terry,2014-03-10 11:27:00,14456,Nice.
840520,NAW,2014-03-10 12:55:00,4022,No more spudding holes at this spot!!  
840542,Rod Caster,2014-03-10 15:32:00,5784,Awesome. That is turning out to be a sweet spot.  Crap that ice is thick!
