840220,MorleyRobertson,2014-03-07 15:47:00,5,"Makes no difference what you call them.  No one in Canada ever heard of a ""Walleye"" before the 60's.. until that point in Canada they were called Pickerel.  And to all the posters who are saying they are Zander, the Zander does not occur in North America.  They are an Eastern hemishpere species widespread throughout Europe and Russia.  They belong to the same genus as the perch and ""walleye"", but are definitely NOT the same fish.  The biggest difference (other than area of existence) is the size.  Zander can reach immense sizes over 40 pounds.   If you're going to call all similar fish Zander, you might as well call the Zander a perch because that's it's genus."

350988,tilly,2009-06-11 05:57:00,32,"Alright, so here it is.  For the second time in my life I found myself fishing pickerel on the Ottawa River (definitely the most powerful and beautiful Canadian river I've fished) with two good friends of mine...we caught numerous pickerel, most were over the slot (15"" until june 15 if my memory isn't too polluted   ) but those within the legal limit were most delilcious...  Fast forward a week or so, tonight I'm reading about pickerel/walleye which led me to the wiki pages relating to both fish (walleye and pickerel)........so (according to wikipedia) pickerel is a species of fish within the genus of esox fish (northern pike and pickerel), but walleye, according to the wiki article, ""also known as the colored pike, yellow pike or pickerel (esp. in English-speaking Canada"" are not actually related to the species pickerel nor pike...so - excuse my language - what the frig is the difference between pickerel and walleye?  Reading through that ""walleye"" article will also lead to this sentence: ""The walleye is sometimes also called the yellow walleye to distinguish it from the Blue walleye, which is now extinct.""  Alright, if the 'blue walleye"" is different from the 'blue pickerel' I'll believe it...but that same weekend on the Ottawa yielded my first two 'blue pickerel', absolutely beautiful fish, and genuinely distinct from the other pickerel i've caught in my life....  arg.... right now if i could shrug my shoulders and show a most confused face through the internet i would...alas i can't, so just answer the damn questions!"
350989,holdfast,2009-06-11 06:07:00,1813,"A Pickerel actually looks like a small pike.. As far as I know there is the Chain and Grass Pickerel and probably other species.  I used to catch them all the time in Lake Champlain Vermont.  A 5lber would be considered a monster.  A Walleye ( Perch Family) is what Canadians ie Ontarians and Albertans are calling a Pickerel.  Its wrong but we know what they mean.  Without going into too much detail, hopefully it clears things.  Why do we call Walleye a pickerel.  I HAVE NO IDEA.  My dad who grew up in Quebec called them a Dore."
351001,Greencoachdog,2009-06-11 11:12:00,8163,"Yeah, my Canadian wife is pretty vehement about Walleye being Pickeral.  ... a Canadian pickeral looks just like a Walleye, only smaller!  It's a regional/local thing, for instance... in Canada a Speck is a Brook Trout, here in Alabama it is the Saltwater Speckled Trout, and in Florida it's what they call Crappie.  It can sound pretty ignorant at times, even to some of the locals... for instance, just a little north of me, around the Gadsden/Guntersville area they go fishing in the winter for Jack SaLmon (they pronounce the ""L"" in Salmon) which is actually a Sauger or Walleye ... that one takes the cake in my book!!!"
351004,lunkerbasshunter,2009-06-11 11:21:00,2585,i find it to be more of a northern thing then a canadian thing.  most who fish southern ontario like erie for example call them walleye but the northeners call them pickeral.  There is also a generation thing as well.  They are pickeral to most older generations but they are walleye to most younger generations.  You can blame the knowledge of the interenet for that one.  either way they taste great and I call them whatever the person i am fishing with calls them lol  cheers!

Anyways, I'm not sure any of this is helping the original poster, does someone have pictures of each species?  I only have walleye to post.

The sides usually have some darker banding. The forward dorsal fin is adorned with sharp spines and the mouth has many sharp teeth; it has large, milky eyes, specially adapted for seeing in the dark.

Spawning occurs in the shallows of gravelly bays or river mouths in spring after ice break-up.  Notes  The walleye is the most popular of NW Ontario game fish, known for its delicious meat. It's diet consists mainly of minnows, leaches, insects and small crustaceans.     Return to Top of Page   --------------------------------------------------------------------------------"
