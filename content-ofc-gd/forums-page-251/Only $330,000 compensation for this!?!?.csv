841009,jbailey,2014-03-13 13:14:00,866,"Apparently, roughly 40% of those wrongfully convicted and incarcerated receive compensation, and there are a number of states that over NO compensation; Alaska, Arizona, Arkansas, Colorado, Delaware, Georgia, Hawaii, Idaho, Indiana, Kansas, Kentucky, Michigan, Minnesota, Nevada, New Mexico, North Dakota, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, South Carolina, South Dakota, Washington and Wyoming. Of the remaining states, some have imposed limits and caps to the compensation one can claim. This compensation is currently taxable. A bill was introduced in 2012 to protect the compensation of those wrongfully convicted, but still has not passed. I recall when the new District Attorney was elected in Texas and reviewed the last 38-40 cases involving the death penalty using DNA and it was discovered that roughly 40% of these inmates were actually innocent. These individuals spent either significant time in prison and their cases overturned and a number were executed as they were not exonerated until after."

840843,lew,2014-03-12 14:31:00,12766,I'd say at least 1 million for every year would be a good start.
840845,limeyangler,2014-03-12 14:51:00,5204,Just one of many reasons why the death penalty is wrong. I had this argument with someone fishing once (we don't fish together anymore….in fact we don't hang out period….and good riddance). he piped up that all murderers/ rapists/paedophiles etc…etc…etc…should be murdered by the state. I tried to point out that the very fact that they get the wrong person from time to time should make us think twice about using it……how are we better if we know we have condemned innocent people to death? He said it was so rare it justified the use. I asked if he would feel the same way if it was his daughter in the dock.

840849,crappieperchhunter,2014-03-12 15:06:00,2582,How could you possibly put a price tag on something like this? No one would ever be happy with the amount. Some will always say it's too much. Some will always say it's too little.  I'd be willing to bet not many will sue for more money. After having spent all that time behind bars I'm sure there first priority isn't spending the next 10 years in the courts trying to squeeze some money out of the system. They probably just wanna be done with it and move on.  Sad story for sure. We live in an imperfect world.

840924,farsider,2014-03-12 23:31:00,456,"I think it is just over ten years or so that the Innocence Project has helped exonerate over 300 people with DNA testing. 18 from Death row.  Unfortunately, DNA evidence is only available to be tested/retested in less than 10% of cases.  How many wrongful convictions are acceptable?  How many wrongful executions?  There are big systemic issues preventing meaningful change;  Anyone who proposes change is quickly labeled ""Soft on crime"" and is voted out or not elected.  Which also chills any future proposals.  It is much easier to demand Mandatory Minimums, More Prisons, Three Strikes, etc.(Because they are ""Tough on Crime""grrr) In the States at least, Judges, Prosecutors, and Sheriffs, face elections.  Little reason to re-examine past convictions and admit mistakes or propose changes.  Canada has had wrongful convictions as well so no reason to feel superior(A common CDN trait) There is a huge imbalance in the available resources for Prosecutors compared with Public Defenders.  If a more fair system is truly desired, it is going to cost more.  People are always up-in-arms when a wrongful conviction is exposed, less so when greater funding is proposed. And the bigger issues of Class, Poverty, Education, Drugs, Racism, and the money involved in the Incarceration business(Business is good!).  It is easier if we don't have to or refuse to look the wrongfully convicted in the eye and admit that one of our bedrock institutions is fatally flawed.  Cheers, Mark  PS. Isn't it grand that the acceptable changes in some jurisdictions is to cap damages of the wrongfully convicted."

840950,Whopper,2014-03-13 01:50:00,2174,"Is our justice system perfect ? No but it constantly evolving, a far cry from public hangings on the square. But most of the time it works like it's supposed too.In this man's case it seems mistakes were made, isn't the first time won't be the last. Is he being compensated enough? Probably not, but like some have said what would be enough? Only he could answer that question.Innocence Project has worked for some but one has to wonder how many they have convicted people they have gotten off on technicalities in the trial process besides the DNA evidence.With that said our imperfect system have let guilty people that have taken lives walk away free.As far as capital punishment, I have no problem imposing it on a guilty person if that person takes another person's life under the death penalty provisions. It's not like one is found guilty today and put to death tomorrow. If I'm not mistaken here. In the state of Ohio conflicted of death row inmates sit in prison for a minimum of 17 years before they are put to death, which gives them more than ample time to appeal.Can't speak for the prison that this man was in but I have personally worked in two medium and one maximum security prisons in this state and the conditions are better in them than some people live on the outside, three squares a day, a bed, heat, AC, education if the want it, sports and cable tv, the only thing they basically can't do is leave."
