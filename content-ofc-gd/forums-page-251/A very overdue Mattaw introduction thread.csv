My name is Max aka Mattaw. I'm from Toronto but fish the Bancroft area often.  I'm an avid Bass and Walleye angler, but you won't hear me complain about catching a Pike or Muskee or two.  This is a fantastic resource for the Ontario fishing community, I haven't found a better, nicer and more honest place. I look forward to participating more here and maybe going fishing with some of you if you're ever in the area (feel free to drop me a line).  Max"
