I made my way to the car and wondered how I was going to get home. I sat in the car while it warmed up and thought about my situation. I remembered my wife's advice that if I got caught in a blizzard, I should wait for a snowplow to come by and follow it. That way I would not have to worry about going off the road or getting stuck in a snow drift.  Sure enough, in a little while, a snowplough went by and I pulled out and began to follow it. As I followed along behind the snowplough, I felt quite comfortable and smug as we continued on our way and I was not having any problem with the blizzard or road conditions. After some time had passed, I was somewhat surprised when the snowplough stopped.  The driver got out of the cab and came back to my car. He signalled me to roll down my window and asked if I was all right, as I had been following him for a long time. I said that I was fine and told him of my wife's advice to follow a plow when caught in a blizzard. The driver replied it was okay with him and that I could continue to follow him if I wanted, but he wanted me to know that he was done with the Wal-Mart parking lot and was going over to Canadian Tire next.

Years ago going ice fishing, going up the 400, light snow dark  .  . .just before the Oakridge we could see lights coming up fast, we were under the limit. he passed us with no problem and kept his speed, as we came over the ridge lights were looking at us in the center lane! he was fine, we kept going!"

The drivers I see constantly driving beyond the capabilities of the vehicle as well as conditions are 20 something girls in little 4 cylinder 2 door pretend sport cars. Without question. Next is 20 something boys in pretend sports cars. Might be a tie.  We haven't talked about the suitability of the vehicle for conditions. That is a factor that makes some like Bill feel they are capable of doing the speed limit in less than ideal conditions. I did the calculations before and it's simple, doing 120 in a 100 gets you there about 10 minutes early going 62 miles. 10 freaking minutes. Hurry up and stop. I guess your 10 minutes is worth someone else's injury, or yours. Do the math your saving a few minutes, come on man."

The ones I'm complaining about are the people who are terrified to be driving on anything but bare, dry pavement.  Rain, snow, whatever it doesn't make a difference.    Those people are a danger to everyone else on the highway and should stay home.  If you want to sit in the middle of the pack with the rest of the lemmings and crawl along, then so be it, why do I care?    I'll drive according to the conditions that I feel comfortable in.  If you want to keep wasting your breath trying to convince me that I'm wrong, by all means keep at it, lol.  Seeing as the subject of this thread is driving in blizzard like conditions that resulted in a pileup, I assumed we were all talking about driving in the snow? You're the only one talking about driving on dry roads while everyone else is talking about winter driving?   I'm far from being an overly cautious driver and get pissed off just as much as you do when people are obviously driving too slow. But, the point of my nagging is far too many drive too fast and close together in the snow which often results serious in accidents and the number of people being overly cautious is greatly outnumbered by those who drive too fast. I didn't buy a CAI, Magnaflow, Superchip, and removed all the extra weight from my Ram w /Hemi because I drive like an old man."

They continued down the road a bit further when all of a sudden there was a huge orange glow showing through the snow right in front of them and they intentionally drove into the ditch to avoid it.  Turns out a flatbed tractor trailer loaded with lumber had jackknifed across the road and other vehicles, including the bus were slamming into the truck and one of them caught fire which also set the lumber on fire.  A car hit the wreckage right beside my brother and also caught fire and even though they did everything possible to get that driver out, the car was mangled and they watched the man burn to death.

What transpired today along the 400, 401 and 402 London was a result of whiteouts. On a clear sunny day with no snow in the forecast you can be driving along and the wind blows off the lake or from the northwest or both at the same time faster than your' re driving. You can not see 15 feet in front of your vehicle as the wind is picking up the snow that fell last month and throws it across a flat field, usually from west to east. Should I stop and wait for someone to plow into me from behind because he's doing 90 before he hits what I call the twilight zone. I can't pull over anyway because I can't tell where the road ends and the 10 foot ditch is. If I know exactly where I am I might choose the ditch. You can't believe how fast it comes up and will last for hours sometimes, a few minutes others. Some of the 80KPH north south roads out here have snow piled so high you are down to one lane. We love it when it rains and then freezes, then whiteouts only when it snows.  Seldom are the roads closed. I'm amazed there are not more fatalities here.   I know many of you guys live in north country and are waterside. But I have to tell you not much compares to the Great Lakes."
838990,BillM,2014-02-28 14:30:00,17367,"There isn't much you can do in a whiteout..  Slow down, toss the 4 ways on and hope someone doesn't slam into the back of you.. If you can get off the highway, even better."
839016,ch312,2014-02-28 16:50:00,1590," Conditions according to who?  The overly cautious ones?  LOL!!    I hate being in a group of cars doing 80km/h on the 400 because there's a bit of snow on the road.   So yes, I'm that guy in the fast lane.   I agree that being cautious is good, being overly is just as bad as the guy weaving in and out of traffic.  Conditions according to everyone who can comprehend the idea that traction and visibility are both greatly reduced with significant snowfalls meaning lower speeds and greater spacing between vehicles is required. Traveling 80 km/h or slower on a 400 series highway during heavy snowfall is not overly cautious, it's called driving according to conditions.  Why do you think there are so many accidents and traffic jams on the 400's with every snowfall? People driving too fast and too close together. Why is it that there are pileups? People driving too fast and too close together. Why would someone get into an accident after avoiding an ""overly cautious"" driver? People driving too fast and too close together.  Notice a pattern?    It's amusing (only when it's obvious nobody is injured!) slowing down beside these people that spin out and hit the ditch after driving too fast or irresponsibly and giving a wave and smile as you drive by. A little toot of the horn added brings out the best of dirty looks"
839034,BillM,2014-02-28 18:40:00,17367,"Who's talking about driving in blizzard like conditions?  Of course you slow down and proceed with caution.   The ones I'm complaining about are the people who are terrified to be driving on anything but bare, dry pavement.  Rain, snow, whatever it doesn't make a difference.    Those people are a danger to everyone else on the highway and should stay home.  If you want to sit in the middle of the pack with the rest of the lemmings and crawl along, then so be it, why do I care?    I'll drive according to the conditions that I feel comfortable in.  If you want to keep wasting your breath trying to convince me that I'm wrong, by all means keep at it, lol."
839059,Joey,2014-02-28 21:37:00,9122,"I've got to agree with BillM on this.  Paul and I do alot of driving for our fishing and vacations in all kinds of weather and the accident causers are the ones who are scared to drive.  They slow everyone down, cause accidents because people get fed up and pass them, they constantly put their brakes on instead of just taking their foot off the accelerator.   They  tend to stay in the middle lane on highways instead of the right/slow lane which makes for more lane changes by everyone.  My extra favorite ones are the ones that drive too slow (under the speed limit) on the 2 lane highways and then when you go to pass them when you finally come to a passing section, they speed up"
839060,davey buoy,2014-02-28 21:49:00,5505,"32 years now running that Barrie to Toronto commute.I've seen to much and can't remember everything.But you seem to learn the pattern of slow lane flashers,middle lane slow,fast lane slow etc. makes it easier to navigate having seen this behavior for so long.Not saying it's easy, a struggle at best.Being patient to some extent has so far kept me accident free for 37 years.Hope I just didn't jinx myself .lol."
839068,Big Cliff,2014-02-28 23:09:00,6899,"Too slow for some is too fast for others! Your driving skills, experience and vehicle may make it plenty safe to do 100 on snow covered slick highways with limited visibility. To someone else that is way beyond their comfort level and 80 is where they feel they have the experience and skill level to be comfortable. I often see the ones that think they are better drivers than they are as I pass them in the ditch and I am always greatful that they are in the ditch rather than head on into someone else that was doing the 80 or whatever.  Yesterday I stopped twice to help people who thought they were better drivers than they were, fortunatly they were the only ones that ended up needing tow trucks.  If you really think you are a good driver and you should go as fast as you can without going off the road then perhaps you need to re evaluate your driving skills! Driving according to conditions means always having control of your vehicle, that means road and traffic conditions!  Max. speed limits are posted for roads that are clear and dry they are not a target that you should try to attain no matter what."
838737,Fisherman,2014-02-27 15:15:00,7201,"Looks like the people can't adjust their driving to the road conditions..again. Multiple and massive collisions on the 400-9, 27, etc."

838754,solopaddler,2014-02-27 16:02:00,8605,"Just got back in. Visibility on the side road I was on was reduced to zero, and I mean zero!  I was virtually stopped when someone in pickup raced towards me doing 80k minimum. When he saw my headlights he veered to the right, lost control and ended up in the ditch.  Stopped to help and it was a young guy, early 20's ""maybe"". He actually had the audacity to say to me if you can't drive in these kinds of conditions you shouldn't be on the road.  He got an earful from me before I called a towtruck for him."
