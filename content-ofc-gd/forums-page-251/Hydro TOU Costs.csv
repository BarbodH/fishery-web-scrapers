838999,cram,2014-02-28 15:16:00,1733,"Common practice for the guys that service our printing equipment. The night crew and weekend crew are pretty much strictly on call. A service technician once told me he didn't think his son had ever been driven to the arena for his hockey in his own vehichle as he is on call every other weekend and takes the work van. Yeah, and if he gets a call he likely has to go right away.  Think they have to stay within a certain distance of the region and be ready to go to work at any time if called in (hence the truck).  Just a guess. "

Every Rogers customer is paying too much monthly so the company can send employee's to Mexico for week long all inclusive vacations. Why not pay for hydro workers to go fishing?"

840033,Dara,2014-03-06 15:25:00,3052,Employees that are issued company vehicles are allowed to use them for personal use.  The government calls it a taxable benefit and you are required to keep track of milage for personal and company use.  You are taxed on your portion of the use.
688369,Raf,2012-04-19 16:05:00,3495,"I wanted to figure out exactly where my dollar is going and what the real cost of electricity per kWh is and thought some of you might find this interesting if you didn’t already know.  I think some people see the TOU prices and think that is it – the actual cost per kWh is quite a bit higher when you add the per kWh Delivery, Regulatory & Debt charges.  I am with Hydro One, live in a rural area – classed as Low Density Residential and on a TOU meter.  Fixed monthly costs are as follows: Delivery – Distribution Service Charge $31.11 / month Regulatory – Standard Supply Service $0.25 / month  On top of that, we have a Sentinel light that costs about $20 / month for the rental / electricity / delivery / regulatory & debt charges.  Finally, there’s an adjustment factor of 1.092 – this means I get billed for 9.2% more kWh than what my meter says due to electricity “losses” before it even reaches my meter.  Here’s a breakdown of my “variable” per kWh costs:  Electricity (c / kWh Adjusted Usage)  Off-Peak – 6.2 Mid-Peak – 9.2 On-Peak – 10.8  To that we add  Delivery Distribution Volume Charge – 3.6 c kWh (Metered Usage) Transmission Connection Charge – 0.44 c kWh (Adjusted Usage) Transmission Network – 0.574 c kWh (Adjusted Usage)  Regulatory Market Service Rate – 0.52 c kWh (Adjusted Usage) Rural Rate Protection – 0.13 c kWh (Adjusted Usage)  And finally Debt Retirement – 0.7c kWh (Metered Usage)  All that equals (c/kWh Adjusted Usage)  Off-Peak – 11.8017 Mid-Peak – 14.8017 On-Peak – 16.4017  A Sample bill  Off-Peak: 500 kWh * 11.8017 c = $59.01  -- of that, $31 is for electricity used, the rest per kWh Delivery/Regulatory/Debt charges. Mid-Peak: 160 kWh * 14.8017 c = $23.68 – of that, $14.72 is for electricity used, the rest per kWh Delivery/Regulatory/Debt charges. On-Peak: 152 kWh * 16.4017 c = $24.93 – of that, $16.31 is for electricity used, the rest per kWh Delivery/Regulatory/Debt charges.  For a total of 812 kWh @ $107.62 - (of that 62.03 is electricity used, the rest per kWh Delivery/Regulatory/Debt charges) - which works out to an average per kWh cost of 13.25 cents. To that we add the fixed costs of 31.36 / month The HST of 13% And Subtract 10% for the Ontario Clean Air Benefit and get a $141.34 Bill  I forgot the Sentinel Light.. $161.34  When you add it all up, about 50% of your bill goes to Delivery, Regulatory and Debt charges."
688373,skeeter99,2012-04-19 16:31:00,109,  looks like you have a consumption problem  old appliances /lights?  detached home family of 4 hydro total bill even in summer with ac going never more than $80 on average about $65 a month
688378,Raf,2012-04-19 16:44:00,3495," this isn't really a complain thread (it is what it is)  but yes, old appliances , country farmhouse that sees a family of 3 24/7 and a family of 4 6-7 days / month. if you're in town (i am assuming) it's a little apples and oranges.  we may have different needs (ie. i use electricity to run a well pump for 'free' water - you pay for water).  you are also likely classed as High Density Residential (ie. in town somewhere) which reduces your fixed monthly Delivery charge 50% (my bill is almost $40 before I even get a kWh from hydro) as well as a lower adjustment factor and you don't have a Sentinel Light."
688391,jimmer,2012-04-19 17:40:00,2730,"I wish my bill was that low. I think I have to get a hydro audit done.  Oh, I also love how they make the bill so complicated that most people don't know what the heck they are paying for."
688512,Jer,2012-04-19 23:27:00,1426,"  I say no way your hydro bill is that low, not if you live in Ontario, unless you have all non-electric appliances and water heater. Then you have to add in your propane costs.  I consider ourselves to be pretty low usage and my bills vary from $100 in summer (no AC) to maybe $130 in winter (wood heat, but more lights and TOU at peak during mornings and evenings). All our appliances are electric and the hot-water tank is by far the biggest draw. We try to keep laundry, showers, etc to off-peak times. I know lots of people whose hydro bills are in the $200 to $300 a month range so you must be doing something right."
688669,Raf,2012-04-20 12:59:00,3495,"Great news, Ontario has approved a TOU rate hike.  The new rates (effective May 1st) will be:  Off-Peak - 6.2 + 0.3 = 6.5 Mid-Peak - 9.2 + 0.8 = 10 On-Peak - 10.8 + 0.9 = 11.7  Effectively, we'll be paying:  Off-Peak – 12.1017 Mid-Peak – 15.6017 On-Peak – 17.3017"
688925,spud7378,2012-04-21 02:55:00,68,"my bill is on average $80 to the $110 range, but as a hydro employee i do know that hydro ones rates are def way higher then a city utility, ive compared my bill to a hydro ones bill with same consumption etc... and it is 1/3 more then mine? so much for the regulation portion? the rich get richer"
688928,irishfield,2012-04-21 03:03:00,26272,"  Sorry.. but I'll call Bull on that as well! My daughters one bedroom garden apartments hydro bill is more than that and she's so cheap she has the heat set at 14C !  Sad that while consumption has always been regulated... nobody is watching the ""supply"" side of the bill. What use to be $16.95/month to have a line to your house + usage has now become usage being about 40% of the bill and delivery and debt recover/HST the other 60%.  Anyone is welcome to pay mine at between $575 and 680 / month!"

Gas furnace, hot water, dryer, and garage heater.  Energy efficient clothes washer, induction top stove.  We are not on TOU yet"
688985,Canuck2fan,2012-04-21 13:47:00,1444,"The sad truth is we still aren't paying the true cost of electricity. During the 70's 80's and most of the 90's Ontario gave away power to manufacturers at less than cost. That is why we all now get to enjoy paying the debt retirement charge with COMPOUND interest. Between the COMPOUND interest and the fact that 90% of the companies who racked up that debt have moved manufacturing off shore the remaining customers are getting screwed and not kissed.  What is especially sickening is the debt was ""said"" to be 7.8 billion and the charges have generated an estimated 8.7 Billion in revenue, however the government estimates that debt will not be retired until at least 2015 or as far out as 2018. It will probably take longer with the ""10%"" off we get now... I would rather pay 10% more now than the compound interest ""another"" loan.  Of course we will never know the truth about what it actually costs vs what we pay as no government could survive after letting us know."
838771,chris.brock,2014-02-27 17:01:00,4053,"some of your bill must go to help fund these guys going ice fishing for the weekend too     I wasn't going to post this, but I just opened my hydro bill and had a change of heart"
838777,ch312,2014-02-27 17:21:00,1590,"Seeing as two people called Bull on skeeters claims, I figured I'd chime in.  Our hydro bill is $75-80/month in the winter and $90 or so in the summer. The furnace and water heater are gas with everything else being electric. We have our fridge and freezer set very cold, chest freezer even colder, furnace (electric fan) at 20c, use a block heater all winter, have two big tv's, window shaker AC set at 19c, and the dryer gets a lot of use with using cloth diapers for the 10 month old.  Gas ranges from $30-35 (near minimum) in the warm months to $70 in the winter.    Having a very well insulated home with newer appliances saves a ton of cash. Before doing the energy upgrades 4 years ago during the home energy audit program (which I made a profit after doing all the work!) our hydro was $120-130  a month in the summer and gas was $110-120 during the winter. Gotta love earning money to make your home more efficient"
838781,bigugli,2014-02-27 17:41:00,6138,"Our hydro bill has averaged $80 in winter, $120 in summer. The discrepancy, by season, is simple. Summer time sees a lot of food processing and canning. That means more kitchen usage and heavier demand on the A/C. Some folks I know have lower bills than I do. It's all about efficient usage."
838788,Dara,2014-02-27 18:03:00,3052,"What I would like to know is why we are paying HST on debt retirement.  This is a loan for services that were built. It the time, all taxes were included in the loan, same as a car loan.  You don't pay tax on a loan payment, so why are we paying tax on a loan that was already taxed.  Dalton was asked this a few years ago and bypassed the question  I sent my MPP an email asking and I was ignored.  Why are we paying tax on something that was already taxed."

It is pretty common for a utility to use ATV's or sleds to access lines in areas that are remote or inaccessible any other way.  If the vehicle is not being used for company business, that is really ballsy and they need to be dealt with anyway!"
