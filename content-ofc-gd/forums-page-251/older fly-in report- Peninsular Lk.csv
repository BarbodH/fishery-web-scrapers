840175,chris.brock,2014-03-07 08:25:00,4053,"somebody wanted me to dig this stuff up, so I thought if I was going through the effort I'd post it here   everyone who has done a fly-in knows this feeling prior to departure, excited anticipation     the inflow of the Attwood (Portage) River was a steady producer all week      it's a magical spot    the big pike seemed to be in a negative mood, they did seem to turn on a little on our last day, I bet the next party in camp had a good week if the weather remained stable     I like looking for pictographs not documented before, here's some faint ones, on a secondary route near Skarrot Lk, poor picture though     a highlight of the trip was the day me and my brother towed a canoe down to the outflow, and lined it down a few rapids, the air was warm, the water was cold      we found what we were after      fat and healthy, and they fought hard      all square tails released    breakfast time for everybody      all seasons are great, but digging through this stuff makes me look forward to summer    "
