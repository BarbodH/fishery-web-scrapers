I'm sure that will be no problem with the ice..he he ...this winter took good care of that. I am interested to know which area is easier to walk to and from where should i start...and which bait shops around LPB have minnows for sale.  Thank you! Cheers!  Gino"

840626,Rich,2014-03-10 23:40:00,3927,Most people walk out from Akers/Bayside Ice Fishing in St. williams. They have minnows there I believe but if not R&R Outdoors in Long Point always has some. You can also walk out from the Old Cut in LP. From what I hear that is the better area this week.

An odd guy will be catching if you find that magic lucky spot. Watch the crack out there, you could go for a swim."
