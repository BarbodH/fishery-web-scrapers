840070,mike rousseau,2014-03-06 19:12:00,4661,  I was wondering if anyone knows of a big chain (walmart... Can tire... Home Depot...etc...) that generally sells 12v batteries for a portable sonar pack...  Or  Another store I should try...  I know this has been brought up before... I just can't find the thread....
840071,NANUK,2014-03-06 19:20:00,797,"LeBaron has them,"
840074,mike rousseau,2014-03-06 19:28:00,4661,Closest Lebaron is 1 hour....  Can tire has em for $40... I just thought that's a lot... they're online for $20...
840077,Cosmos,2014-03-06 19:39:00,588,any computer stores - ask for battery for ups. They are same size and voltage.
840087,aplumma,2014-03-06 20:13:00,6896,Mike  Home Depot has them for alarm systems in the area where they sell lighting  and emergency lighting batteries.   Qualified: with that is in the USA.  Art
840151,adempsey,2014-03-07 00:49:00,1498,"Sail, Le Baron, Princess Auto, Total Battery. Probably at a bunch of electronic stores too.  My last one i picked up from Radioworld.  Online too - Batterybuyer.com.  I'd also recommend getting a 9Ah instead of the typical 7Ah if you want more use time.  Alternatively you can use 8 AA's or D's, but they are only useful if your sonar doesn't require a lot of juice."
840154,Fisherpete,2014-03-07 01:02:00,1814,"The good thing about the Humminbird brand battery at LeBaron is that it is a gel cell, and also the charger is included... I'm guessing you probably already have one though.  As others have mentioned, get a 9aH instead of a 7Ah if you can... depending on the power draw of your unit, it may be key to fishing a full day.  Have you tried asking at Canadian Tire if they will price match?  Pete"
840189,SirCranksalot,2014-03-07 13:23:00,3291,any computer stores - ask for battery for ups. They are same size and voltage.  I'll be looking for a battery soon too. Glad to see this thread. What's a 'ups' or is that a typo? thx

840212,SirCranksalot,2014-03-07 15:31:00,3291,Thx kuha and Costa for clearing that up. Is the one shown on the link a better quality than at CT? The price is similar.
840232,mike rousseau,2014-03-07 16:38:00,4661,Thanks everyone...  Gunna check some stores today....
840234,DanD,2014-03-07 16:40:00,2223,If there is an Interstate battery close to you give them a try. I've been using one of their sealed emergency lighting batteries for a couple of years now. The battery fits inside the case of the finder and I can go three or four days without having to charge the thing. I think I paid something around $25.00 for it.  Dan.

840247,irishfield,2014-03-07 18:21:00,26272,Keep moving... Shouldn't be paying more than $40 tops. Go to your local alarm company if you have no better options.. they'll get you for $60

840372,fishnsled,2014-03-09 00:23:00,3520,I was at Princess Auto today and saw them for $20 if anyone else is looking. 9A as well.
840481,Canuck,2014-03-09 23:26:00,491,i bought a sealed AGM from Sayal Electronics in Burlington.  I think its a backup for a security system.  Works great and does not have to be right side up. It fits in my portable Eagle's case so its great.    i don't know the amp hrs though.
840660,Sinker,2014-03-11 02:12:00,8692,Electrical supply shop. Any more than $25 your getting ripped off.
840676,porkpie,2014-03-11 03:32:00,2521,Got mine there!!
840679,irishfield,2014-03-11 03:35:00,26272,Just be careful buying at PA that you're not getting an old surplus or second hand battery. That's what they use to sell in their earlier days in Barrie.... .batteries from stripped out back up units.
