839766,Freshtrax,2014-03-05 02:38:00,2215,Haventfished that side of the lake since I was about 9. With my grandfather and we always went north of Georgina.  We have a cottage rented end next weekend for the boys and I'm just looking for good depths on that side of the lake for some whitefish/ lakers 80 fow ? Or head out further.
839812,quickme,2014-03-05 14:24:00,261,its a long walk.  If you have a sled or ATV you'll make life much easier.  Its about 3km to 78 feet.
840026,Fish Farmer,2014-03-06 13:40:00,2234,"Trucks were driving all over the lake yesterday. I parked at 9th. line Innisville on ice and drove my ATV all over looking for Whities. Not very successful. Can't believe the amount of people out fishin. Drove over to the east side of the Islands and tried different depths, nada. The only place I marked any fish was the west side of Fox. 53FTW. got a few bumps and caught a few dink Perch. Talked to a few people that were looking for Whities, they never saw a fish. Ice is at least 2' thick. A very few people are catching Whities, not like it used to be. Some locals are catching, there out there every day. There is fish out there, just got to find that lucky spot."
840028,Terry,2014-03-06 13:59:00,14456,"Yeah some people are right onto them, I'm not one of them. Seems they have moved but more important they have changed their diet. Many are now full of gobies."
840123,misfish,2014-03-06 22:58:00,29133,"I,ll take a dozen of them 10 inch smelts over a whitie. YUM YUM.  What a great ice season we have had this year.  Think we started in early Nov and have not looked back.   OH CANADA HOW THE ICE SHOULD BE."

840238,Freshtrax,2014-03-07 17:12:00,2215,Thanks sinker.   I'm headed out for a scouting mission with my newfangled auger attachment and the sonar.   I'd like to put my buddy's on some fish as they only get out once or twice a year.
