A Newfie is walking home kicking old bottles, when a genie pops out of one. ""I can grant you three wishes,"" says the genie, ""so choose wisely."" The Newfie says ""Give me a beer that’ll never run out."" A bottle appears in the Newfie’s hand and he downs it, but when we pulls it away from his mouth it’s still full. The happy Newfie continues walking home. The genie says ""Hey, you still have two wishes left!"" ""Oh,"" says the Newfie, ""gimme two more of these then!""  An Ontarian, an Albertan, and a Newfie are running from the cops. They run into an alley and see a pile of sacks, which they decide to hide in. The cops follow them into the alley and kick the bag with the Ontarian in it. The Ontarian goes ""meow!"" and the cops go ""Ah, it's just a bag full of cats."" They kick the bag with the Albertan in it, and he goes ""woof!"" and they're like, ""OK, dog in a bag, whatever."" Then they kick the bag with the Newfie in it, and he goes ""potato!""     "
