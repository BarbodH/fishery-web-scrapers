840637,kickingfrog,2014-03-11 01:05:00,8333,"Of course Simon has already done his own version of this but...  https://ca.news.yahoo.com/blogs/daily-buzz/video-chronicles-life-canada-eyes-englishman-194857333.html    Canada rocks! So much so that James O’Malley from Leicester, England, filmed himself doing as many ""Canadian"" things as he could during his visit to Ontario. In just three minutes, O’Malley is able to capture all things Canadian through his video montageposted to YouTube.  Sure, Canada has all kinds of stigmas, all of which we accept whole-heartedly. Sorry, but it’s just the kind of people we are. And we say sorry…a lot. In his video O’Malley visits all the Canadian tourist attractions such as the CN Tower, the ROM, Honest Eds, The Beer Store, Tim Hortons, Niagara Falls, The Brunswick House (which is now where flocks of college students come to drink their stresses away), and Casa Loma, among many others. He did as many ""Canadian"" things that he could including: ice fishing, snowmobiling, 5-pin bowling, travelling across a frozen river in a car, shooting a gun, enduring a snowstorm in a t-shirt, watching children play hockey (and avoiding the crazy hockey mom's), driving on ice roads, and attending the most expensive hockey game he'll probably ever attend, aka The Toronto Maple Leafs. O’Malley seemed especially excited about driving on the ""wrong"" side of the road! In many of his clips, he certainly doesn’t look prepared for the weather. Did he miss the memo on the horrendous winter we've had this year? It. Is. Cold. Like, bring-a-parka-even-if-it’s-not-winter kind of cold. Apparently O’Malley even found the ‘7-ELEVEN’ convenience store chain worthy of being in his ‘All-Canadian’ video. Even our old pal George Stroumboulopoulos himself makes a cameo in O’Malley’s video! The video ends in the most fitting way; O’Malley falling asleep in the back seat of a car as all his Canadian sightseeing surely tuckered the poor Englishman out. His video is a nice little reminder of the amazing things we have in this country, right in our own backyards! So, get out and have enjoy a new Canadian adventures, eh?"

His girlfriend lives in Timmins, so they thought they would come for a 3 week vacation,..., in winter.  I would have preferred a vacation place that didn't have a white background,..., and foreground.  More snow here in St Thomas.... again!"
