840579,tb4me,2014-03-10 19:04:00,3295,Honestly congrats to JR but he better get his 2nd win while he is hot..With the new format he is gonna need 2 wins to lock himself in the chase early..
840582,misfish,2014-03-10 19:11:00,29133,Oh I got a good feeling about Bristol.  He is locked in.
840604,danc,2014-03-10 21:45:00,4677,Honestly congrats to JR but he better get his 2nd win while he is hot..With the new format he is gonna need 2 wins to lock himself in the chase early.. He won't need two wins. No way is there going to be over 16 different winners in the first 26 races.

840609,misfish,2014-03-10 22:11:00,29133,"  Not sure ole jimmy wants to wait til then. The young guns are strong this year. Not that JR is a young gun,but it,s going to be a tough great season.  Oh and ya,Jeff is looking good. Nice to see."
