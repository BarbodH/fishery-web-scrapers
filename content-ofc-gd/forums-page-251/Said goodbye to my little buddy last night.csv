840421,lew,2014-03-09 12:14:00,12766,"That picture of Marvin and I with the matching touques actually won 2nd place in a Toronto Sun ""dog/master"" lookalike  contest. In the original picture only I had the hat but Terry used his puter skills and gave Marv one too.  And yes it's framed and sits on the desk right beside this computer."
840526,DT10Sam,2014-03-10 13:43:00,480,"Sorry for your loss Lew, I know how tough that decision is."
839924,Musky or Specks,2014-03-05 22:11:00,2710,Lew so sorry to hear I've had to put down two dogs in my life. Despite how much I love dogs can't go through that again.
839942,buick14,2014-03-05 23:10:00,741,Sorry buddy
839950,bigcreekdad,2014-03-05 23:42:00,546,"Lew  So sad. Been there. Had to put down our beloved flatcoated retriever, Seamus, at a young 8 years old a few years ago. I cried like a baby. It still bothers me.  I've said this before, and will say it as long as I live....dogs are way better than most people I know.  Hang in there."
839952,Rod Caster,2014-03-05 23:46:00,5784,18 years is a good long life for a dog. Looks like he enjoyed those years together as much as you did.

I am glad that you chose to do what was best for Marvin. Nothing to regret in that. Marvin got one year more than our Lucky, and I am sure they were wonderful years."
840008,Twocoda,2014-03-06 03:55:00,4130,They say a man can be judged on the way he treats his dog...I think this thread is a testament to your character Lew..Marvin was fortunate to have you as his human..His memories will always be a staple that holds your character together..Sorry for your loss but im happy he gave you the opportunity of 18 years of happiness...Cheers to Marvin and you
840009,danbouck,2014-03-06 03:58:00,4380,Sorry to hear Lew. Marvin was a great dog.
840024,Fish Farmer,2014-03-06 13:13:00,2234,"Sorry for your loss Lew. Sometimes it's nice having a dog, but losing one is not so."
840025,BITEME,2014-03-06 13:27:00,1968,Sorry for you loss Lew you guys made a good tag team  Peter
840150,danc,2014-03-07 00:46:00,4677,"So sorry Lew and Diane. As a dog owner myself, I can surely relate. A few months ago, I came across something that had a big enough effect on me, that I saved it. It's appropriate for times like this. I hope you like it..  Rainbow BridgeJust this side of heaven is a place called Rainbow Bridge.When an animal dies that has been especially close to someone here, that pet goes to Rainbow Bridge. There are meadows and hills for all of our special friends so they can run and play together. There is plenty of food, water and sunshine, and our friends are warm and comfortable.All the animals who had been ill and old are restored to health and vigor; those who were hurt or maimed are made whole and strong again,just as we remember them in our dreams of days and times gone by. The animals are happy and content, except for one small thing; they each miss someone very special to them, who had to be left behind.They all run and play together, but the day comes when one suddenly stops and looks into the distance. His bright eyes are intent; His eagerbody quivers. Suddenly he begins to run from the group, flying over the green grass, his legs carrying him faster and faster.You have been spotted, and when you and your special friend finally meet, you cling together in joyous reunion, never to be parted again.The happy kisses rain upon your face; your hands again caress the beloved head, and you look once more into the trusting eyes of your pet,so long gone from your life but never absent from your heart.Then you cross Rainbow Bridge together....Author unknown..."
840176,lew,2014-03-07 08:29:00,12766,"Thanks for that Dan, it's an enjoyable read and actually another member sent me the same thing a couple days ago.  After the vet administered the drugs to Marv, then determined that he was gone, her assistant looked at me &  said ""it's OK now Lew, Marvins crossed the rainbow bridge""  It somehow made me feel a bit better."
840178,chris.brock,2014-03-07 08:59:00,4053,"sad story, sounds like you guys were good buds"
840179,lew,2014-03-07 09:32:00,12766,"Yeah we were Chris, very good buds."
840404,Dutch,2014-03-09 03:35:00,831,"So sorry for your loss, Lew. Nothing harder than saying goodbye."
839820,Steve,2014-03-05 15:15:00,2075,"i'm sorry man.  when we put down our dog in 2007, I never got another...  time is supposed to heal....  we are only now thinking about getting another.....  again, very sorry."
839824,irishfield,2014-03-05 15:29:00,26272,"Marvin was such a great dog Lew... so sorry for the loss of your bestest friend!  Been there three times in my life Lew. Having to put our black lab ""Rikki II"" to sleep a few years back had me so down I'll never bring myself to have another dog, but partly due to the fact I backed over him with the truck while plowing before the inevitable had to happen.  Hopefully in your situation you know that Marvin lived a GOOD long life with a great best friend in you... and you can move forward from here out."
839826,Gallie,2014-03-05 15:31:00,1215,"Very sorry about your dog, i have had them all my life and it never gets easier. 18 is defintely a good run though."
839829,bare foot wader,2014-03-05 15:49:00,1354,"Sorry for your loss.  My vet once told us that he was amazed how long some dogs live past their prime, and he always felt that a long life was at least a little reflective of the care and love the dog receives from his master, sounds like Marvin lived a great life."
839831,4x4bassin,2014-03-05 16:06:00,1025,"I'm truly sorry for your loss Lew  . The family dog does become part of you and when that day comes when you have to say goodbye is for sure one of the toughest things to do . I have been there before as well and time does heal , but it sure was a long time !"
839833,ccmtcanada,2014-03-05 16:16:00,7971,Very sorry to hear this news Lew.

839845,lew,2014-03-05 16:52:00,12766,"Thanks once more for all the kind words folks, it really means alot and it would appear as if we have many dog lovers on this board.  John....we saved a few of Marvin's favorite toys for keepsakes and one of them was the boomerang you guys bought him a few years back to play with in the water, it was one he really enjoyed.  Wayne....I remember when you had the accident with your dog, that was really tagic.  Oh wow, I'm so sorry Lew.  Losing our pets is the worst thing, so sad.  Ralphie is going to miss him at Lakair I can tell you that!  This may sound weird, but I had a dream about them playing up there last night.  Maybe that was Marvin letting us now he's in doggy Lakair heaven?  I hope so bud.  Give Diane a hug for me please and again, I'm so sorry for your loss. Joey, that dream you had is unreal but hopefully there's some truth to what you said.  Marvin has been a bit old to play with Ralphie the last couple years but he sure enjoyed hanging out with him anyways.  "

839868,Gerritt,2014-03-05 18:22:00,6129,Wow that sucks Lew. It's amazing the bond that develops between a dog and family. I'm sure Marvin is thankful for the love and shelter you and your family provided.  G.
839872,Joey,2014-03-05 18:47:00,9122,"Ya Lew, I woke up and remembered a bit of the dream and my thoughts just wandered on to looking forward to going to Lakair this year, then when I saw your thread, I was pretty stunned to say the least.  Ralphie is kind of picky about which dogs he likes, and he loved Marvin.  Maybe since Marvin couldn't play so much due to his age, Ralphie just thought he was playing hard to get"
839873,Spiel,2014-03-05 19:04:00,9065,I dread the day it comes to my home Lew. I'm totally in sync with your thoughts no doubt. Marvin was fortunate to have you and your loved ones in his world every day.

Its too bad they didn't live longer. I couldn't live without one though, just part of life for me.  Sorry for your loss.  S."

To be honest Lew Im sure this was the case for you and Marvin, and there are a hell of alot of great pooches out there that can use that affection maybe one day you will find it in your heart to give another one a try?

He was a wonderful friend and companion and he couldn't have had a better home. I know from experience the hole that they can leave in our lives, and they will never be forgotten! May he forever live on in your heart and the hearts of all of those he touched in the years gone by. R.I.P Marvin the wonder dog!"
839919,lew,2014-03-05 22:09:00,12766,"Our last dog was a little poodle name Scamper that we loved just as much as Marvin and we had her for 13 years before we had to put her down. We said then that we'd never have another dog and we didn't for 8 years but then we decided that we'd do it again. Here we are all these years later and again we say no more dogs, but this time we'll stick to it.  Dogs are one of the best things God ever came up with and they've sure enriched my life over the last 60 odd years, but Marvin will be the last pet we'll own."

Marvin was just an absolute joy to be around and I think his whole purpose in life was to make as many friends as he could. He loved to run in the woods, swim in the lake, ride in the boat and in general just really loved life and everybody he knew.  He lived a long and VERY happy life and was nearly 18 years old, but lost his hearing a couple years back and then his eyesight in the last year. He still got around OK but age was catching up to him and we made the sad decision. We have a great vet that looks after him and she came out to the house yesterday to do what all dog lovers dread.  He was my  little buddy and he's sure gonna be missed.      "
