840566,Steelheadphycho,2014-03-10 18:22:00,470,A friend of mine sent me this link and it surprises me that I didn't see it here on OFC. I didn't see it on my home forums Ohio game fishing either ..... Guy catches a world record lake trout and it means NOTHING!  Not sure what to think about it......  http://m.startribune.com/?id=247563501

Instead he looks like a fool, probably get a fine, and will likely not get the fish back to be mounted anyway."
