She has been spotted recently but either no one can catch her or just assumed she belonged to somone taking her out for run. I know a lot of people on her live in, near and fish in Toronto and maybe someone has spotted her.  The link is from another forum and has all the information. About the 5th post down in the thread is the owners contact info.  http://www.pets.ca/forum/showthread.php?t=59211  There are also these two dogs that bolted after a car accindent.  http://www.pets.ca/forum/showthread.php?t=59543  Again I hope it's ok to post this and thanks."
