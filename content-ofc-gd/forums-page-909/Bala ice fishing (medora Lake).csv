Although we didnt catch anything, i was able to introdce my girlfriend to the sport and get her accustomed to the requirements....she loved it and is hoping to go back out soon.  Ice was extremely deep under a good 1.5 feet of snow. had to use a chainsaw and it took the entire blade, plus a shove at the bottom to get all the way through it...I as quite surprised.  here is our only real pic of our spot.  http://www.flickr.com/photos/youngvedder/3209034823/  Was also able to test out the Humminbird 565 portable. it was easy to use, worked well, and also gave a temp which I didnt know it would do!  cheers,  Yv"
