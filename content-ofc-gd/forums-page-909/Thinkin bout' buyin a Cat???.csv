295361,richyb,2009-01-21 15:17:00,774,BUY IT !!!!  are you waiting for someone to hold your hand and take you over there to get it ?    JUST KIDDING ! !!!  I am a cat man so i guess im a bit bias. but i dont think it will get over 90 like ciceri said.
295363,ciceri,2009-01-21 15:45:00,535," if it has power valves it will, if not, 80's.  I know 2 people with 500 cats, ones an F5 that is capable of 100 MPH and a 98 zr, that will do 90-95.  These are dream-o-meter speeds."
295429,carll2,2009-01-21 21:32:00,443,the zr 500 has powervalves.. but btw if your looking to get to back lakes with lots of deep snow may i recommend something with a long track like an artic cat powder special 580
295453,ecmilley,2009-01-21 22:19:00,2163,"zr series sleds are pretty good, handle nice if it's in good order don't see you having to many issues other than regular maintenance"
