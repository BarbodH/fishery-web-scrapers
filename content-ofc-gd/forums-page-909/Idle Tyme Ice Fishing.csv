This is the second year with Idle Tyme and we'll be going again next year. The two bedroom cottage had all the amenities other than bring your own sleeping bag, no problem. The ice hut was huge for 4 guys, 10x12 equipped with a sweet wood stove. Friday morning there was a power outage in the local area, packed up all the fixins for breakfast, off to hut and did the cooking out there. No inconvenience what so ever. Friday and Saturday had good numbers of perch, a few herring a couple of small walleye and 3 bite offs, never got to see them, probably pike. Took home 45 perch and 2 herring to smoke. Sunday was a little slower, didn't really mind, we were pretty much fished out. We had a great time, Warren came out and checked on us 3-4 times a day. I would recommend this operator without hesitation.  Should have taken a few more pictures but when the lines are going up and down you tend to forget."

We had great days out there for whitefish and eyes......... put down some salted minnows, a spreader with a few crazy pinhead and just wait.  We would jig a williams with a dropper line and a preal!"
295200,trapshooter,2009-01-21 01:47:00,1234,I've also gone out with warren at Idle Tyme and he was great.  He's a little further west then the calander crowd on a spot called Deep Water Point.  Always had pretty good action there too.
295203,solopaddler,2009-01-21 01:50:00,8605,"I fished it for years back when Ross still owned it, always caught tons of fish. If the huts are still the same they were the best and biggest I've ever fished out of. Huge red things with a small inset wood stove at one end...."
295207,buckster,2009-01-21 01:54:00,530,Ross was the man on deepwater point!   and he baited the hell outta his huts
295211,solopaddler,2009-01-21 02:02:00,8605, He was the man for sure. Actually came pretty close to buying the camp when he put it up for sale. I've often wondered how that would have turned out...
