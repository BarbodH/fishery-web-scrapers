295559,bridge,2009-01-22 02:40:00,54,Woundering if anyone could give an idea on how hard it is fix a leaking lower unit.  The motor is a 25 hp merc and its leaking around the prop.  Or should I just have it looked at by someone that knows what there doing?  Any thoughts would be great.  bridge
295566,Terry,2009-01-22 02:49:00,14456,if it's the seal it's easy
295567,purekgw,2009-01-22 02:50:00,585,have u taken the prop off and looked at it some times fishing line can get caught in there
295574,Sinker,2009-01-22 02:58:00,8692,Are you sure its not just unburnt oil? Assuming its a 2 stroke.......  Its fairly common.  Gear oil stinks......prop seals are an easy fix though.  Sinker
295586,bridge,2009-01-22 03:12:00,54, The oil thats leaking is fairly thin and black.  Changed the lower unit oil today to have a look see and it was still the same as when I put it in.  It is a 2 stroke.  I'm a fairly new boat owner and have never hear of the unburnt oil thing.  I know a couple of times I have gone a little heavy on the oil though.  thanks
295587,bridge,2009-01-22 03:14:00,54,  I've never had the prop off but I don't think I've ever run through any line either.
295594,Sinker,2009-01-22 03:26:00,8692,"Its unburnt oil, leaking out the exaust port in the prop.  If its black, it is, and if your gear oil is not milky, then your prop seals aren't leaking.  For a 50:1 mix, put 20ml of oil in each litre of gas.  Sinker"
295599,purekgw,2009-01-22 03:32:00,585,"you usually dont know if you go through line, its just small peaces that get caught"
295601,bridge,2009-01-22 03:33:00,54,  thanks for the info
295602,Sinker,2009-01-22 03:34:00,8692,Anytime!  Sinker
295603,bridge,2009-01-22 03:35:00,54, could thick weeds do the same damage??  run through that quite a bit.
295607,limeyangler,2009-01-22 03:38:00,5204,"   Thanks for the info again Sinker, i was just looking at my 30 yamaha 2 stroke, same thing a small amount of black oil  on the garage floor,,,, good to know its ok."
295615,Sinker,2009-01-22 03:43:00,8692," Not so much, but after a few years it might cause some damage. Rushes get wrapped up pretty good on mine when I'm duck hunting, but it hasn't caused any damage. Its a good idea to take the prop off when your winterizing your motor to check for anything around the prop shaft.....you never know what you might pick up. Its a 5 minute job......just make sure to replace the pin with the right size every time. Don't re-use the old one.  Sinker"
295879,fishermccann,2009-01-22 21:52:00,655,Congrats sinker on your 1500th post
295886,jwl,2009-01-22 22:12:00,1056,"my guess is unburnt oil if it's black....my old 9.9 does that if sitting for long periods of time, there will be a bit of drippage from the prop and also from the water drain holes(exhaust come out with the water on my model)"
295887,Raf,2009-01-22 22:15:00,3495,"if you've gone through thick weeds, you may have easily gone through / picked up line too.  you just never know, doesn't hurt to check."
