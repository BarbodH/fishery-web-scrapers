296044,Alumacraft,2009-01-23 09:56:00,139,"Cram I went thru this last year about this time as my buddy had purchased a cottage on Nosbonsing. Unfortunately there are no actual hydrographic maps available (not that I could find anyway) but I did find 2 maps online that I ordered. I don't know if you were looking for one to download but I could not find one of those either. Of the 2 that I ordered the best one was from here http://www.fishingmapsplus.com/.On this site click maps and look for Nippissing county. I also found this one http://www.adventurefishingmaps.on.ca/. On this site click complete list and prices then click on northern Ontario. I believe they both sell them for around $10, they are both laminated and waterproof (that is until your kids damn cat chews on one of the corners). The one from fishing maps plus has much more detail than the other one from adventure fishing maps. If you are going to order one I would definitely recommend the one from fishing maps plus.Cram I have only fished this lake a couple of times but if you have any other questions about Nosbonsing I'll do my best to answer them.  I hope this helps you in your search Rob"
