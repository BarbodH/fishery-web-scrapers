295044,Fisherman,2009-01-20 16:32:00,7201,"It does work well, the only thing I would add is to use a sharp knife with a very short blade, something like an X-acto blade."
295081,misfish,2009-01-20 20:01:00,29133, And that rapala knife was DULL as poop
295117,holdfast,2009-01-20 22:31:00,1813,"Ive seen pliars used to peel the skin.  Now that Ive seen this film, now I know what it reminds me of.  an INFO COMMERCIAL, or whatever you callit.  you know, the crap that pollutes the airwaves after 0200hrs.  Its that cheerleading Geek in the background that gives it away.  Sorry, just cant help laughing."
295121,danw,2009-01-20 22:38:00,72,"Very cool, gotta find me some perch so I can try."
295171,Greencoachdog,2009-01-21 00:39:00,8163, Oh!... isn't that just Ducky!!!  A Newfie that doesn't know how to sharpen a fillet knife!
295180,misfish,2009-01-21 00:54:00,29133," I WAS HUNGRY.  Dont start with me,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,YANK I have a stone here thats probly older then you............................If thats possible."
295194,Greencoachdog,2009-01-21 01:26:00,8163,  ... because you don't know how to use it???
295209,misfish,2009-01-21 01:59:00,29133," Well there ya go dish,n me again. As I was taught,slish slash,slish slash,wipe,up she comes,up she comes.shish slash,there she be. Ready for another feed.  I,ll show ya it sometime."
295397,Headhunter,2009-01-21 18:49:00,5703,"I do it the same way Brian does, except when skinning, I move the skin under the knife, not the knife. HH"
295438,Greencoachdog,2009-01-21 21:55:00,8163,"  How much fun would it be around here, if you couldn't pick on a Newfie or a Redneck every once in a while?"
295458,misfish,2009-01-21 22:31:00,29133, How true.
294486,John Kimble,2009-01-19 06:49:00,12,"Check out the video at:     http://ca.youtube.com/watch?v=pjTlFwQb7D0  Kept a dozen or so Perch for a fresh dinner and the rest were released to fight another day. Then we went after the whities and lakers and the rest was history!  Enjoy!  ~ John Kimble    <object width=""425"" height=""344""><param name=""movie"" value="""
294487,young_one,2009-01-19 07:04:00,620,WOW! I will definitely try that next time! How is the spine removed?
294493,Terry,2009-01-19 11:08:00,14456,"every cool saw it on another website  but the ribcage remains, does it not"
294507,Riparian,2009-01-19 12:41:00,269,"The ribcage remains, but the point is there is no wasted meat. The meat can be pulled of the bones on the plate with your fork.  Its a great way to diversify the way you cook perch. These bodies can be a part of a tray bake with veggies or broiled under a broiler. The body cavities can be stuffed with herbs and lemon and but on a screaming hot bbq."
294508,holdfast,2009-01-19 12:52:00,1813,You can just cut the rib cage out.  I didnt think there was any other way to clean a perch.  I spent hours watching the Americans clean perch that way on lake Champlain as a kid.  If he would keep the Rib cage he would take a hard brush (plastic Bristles) and clean in the rib cage.  Watched our neihbors do bucket fuls using a pen knife.  You still got to be careful of the bones.
294524,Greencoachdog,2009-01-19 14:08:00,8163,"That actually took 1 minute and not 10 seconds... and he needs to leave a patch of skin on that fish if he plans on transporting it!  The spine and rib cage were still left in the fish, he just peeled out the dorsal fin."
294525,Guest gbfisher,2009-01-19 14:13:00,0,"My kids wouldn't eat another fish if it had bones in it.. Come to think about it, neither would I. I realize some cultures spit undesirable food out while they eat and Thats OK!! ....I doubt my wife could get used to that...."
294570,brifishrgy,2009-01-19 15:41:00,559,  I was thinking the same thing
294719,misfish,2009-01-19 22:39:00,29133,"Not ten seconds,but NO bones.LOL  <embed width=""448"" height=""361"" type=""application/x-shockwave-flash"" wmode=""transparent"" src=""http://img.photobucket.com/player.swf?file=http://vidmg.photobucket.com/albums/v731/misfish/perchn23005.flv"">"
294731,Guest gbfisher,2009-01-19 22:57:00,0,now ya did it....IM HUNGRY~!
294740,Terry,2009-01-19 23:07:00,14456,any good newfie had better be able to cut up fish...LOL
294741,irishfield,2009-01-19 23:09:00,26272,  yah.. but Brian....
294759,Sinker,2009-01-19 23:40:00,8692," You got that right!  I do it like Brian posted. I use the small rapala knife though. I can do one in about a minute.....ready to fry and if you find a bone, you get a dollar!!  Sinker"
294768,solopaddler,2009-01-19 23:49:00,8605,I did 100 by myself in precisely 1 hour 54 minutes last week with at least 3 beverage breaks thrown in.
294773,diggyj,2009-01-19 23:53:00,548,Is he a member of the OFC community?
294787,Riparian,2009-01-20 00:18:00,269,"You dont put the bones in your mouth, You take the meat off the bone with a fork.  Sometimes I cook trout this way in the oven, but with the skin on. When you serve it you just take chunks of meat off and since the ribcage is still attached to the spine, it lifts off bone free."
294804,Joey,2009-01-20 00:58:00,9122,I just did two sunday filet sessions.  I did it the way the second video shows.  Took me about a minute a fish.  Joey
294839,Rattletrap2,2009-01-20 02:22:00,1652,"When I used to catch fish, I did mine like Brian does in the second video!"
294895,ehg,2009-01-20 03:36:00,2666,"The complete boneless fillets in the second video, took only 5 seconds longer than that minute long dangerous first video method."
294897,wallacio,2009-01-20 03:38:00,475,"Here's another variation (which I prefer)...similar to the second video but you cut right through the rib cage, following the spine with your knife and then remove the rib bones after.   I find that it's a bit easier than having to cut down along the rib bones.  "
294898,Greencoachdog,2009-01-20 03:40:00,8163, What the heck???  They won't bite your hook anymore RT2???
294899,snag,2009-01-20 03:42:00,1932, I love that you timed it!!  
294926,rbaquial,2009-01-20 04:53:00,968,  LMAOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!
295040,Markystang,2009-01-20 16:12:00,131,That's how I do it.
295043,anders,2009-01-20 16:29:00,1168,regardless of bones or not...its a cool way to do it.  Thanks for showing.  I will definitly try it next time i get some perch.
