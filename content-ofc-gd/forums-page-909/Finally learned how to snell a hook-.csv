Just wondering what else I could use this knot for.  And P.S. If you have not tried to do this knot before, give it a try itâ€™s simple!"
295635,douG,2009-01-22 04:10:00,2693,"I like a palomar knot for dropshotting, but you can't beat a snell for crawler rigs and carp gear."
295648,MCTFisher9120,2009-01-22 04:30:00,3761,"I saw a fishing video after i learned the snell and the man who was fishing the drop shot was using a palomar, this made the hook stick out vertically and was his fav knot. None the less i`m sure i will find many techniques where this knot will come in handy."
295657,Sinker,2009-01-22 04:56:00,8692,I snell any hook with an offset eye......i don't like them offset eyes on hooks....I seem to lose more fish with them.  Sinker
295659,BillM,2009-01-22 04:58:00,17367,I use the palomar knot when dropshotting also.   I don't think I've ever used a snell for anything.
295676,young_one,2009-01-22 06:18:00,620,"snell knot for all my hooks, except drop-shotting or trying to tie a knot in the dark. I especially snell knot my hooks for Trout and Salmon in the river, a faster, more straight hook set!"
295729,BillM,2009-01-22 13:20:00,17367," How is a hookset with a snell knot, any different then say an improved clinch or Trilene?"
295737,NAC,2009-01-22 13:31:00,369,snell knot for octopus hooks will get you way less missed hooksets.
