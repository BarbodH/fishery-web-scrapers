295921,Rustic-Fisher,2009-01-23 00:20:00,826,"Just like other posts said, the fish have been on all week. keep a few whitie's and laker and released a bunch more between two of us. Tons of bait fish, isolate the jigging spoon from the bait ball and they were rocketing through the bait clusters to attack the lone spoon.  Whitie's and a few lakers were on the Bad boy.  Good luck!! RF   "
