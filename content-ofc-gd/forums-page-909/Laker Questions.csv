295782,Cudz,2009-01-22 15:26:00,2652,Either BBP or Shanty bay or Hawkstone area (all fairly close to you). Try 85-100ft of water.  Use a spreader with minnows and a cheater hook about 2 ft up the line as well with a minnow on it in one hole and keep jigging with the williams or a bad boyz jig tipped with a micro tube in a second hole.  Keep the spreader on the bottom or very close to bottom and use the jig at various depths.  Hope that helps.

Lakers move around and tend to 'pass by' once or twice a day in any given area as they forage for food .. so sometimes its just a matter of trying a different time of day.  I have always had the best luck a little later in the morning than you might think ... like 8:30 to 9:30 or even 10 and again in the early afternoon ... I tend to try two different approaches at once .... one live/dead bait right on or near the bottom and another live or jig higher up in the water column ...  Because the lakers are constantly moving you can never be sure where or when you are going to get a hit ... I have noticed though, that action always seems to be better when other things are 'happening' .. like switching baits, like bringing up to check baits ... or dropping down after checking baits ... so dont just stick with one thing (unless its working) ... and most important ... enjoy !"
295805,tonyb,2009-01-22 16:19:00,1637,"If you don't have a sonar or at least a flasher that would be a step in the right direction.  On many occasions I have witnessed fish shown on sonar come in to look at your bait but they won't hit it.  By using the sonar you can see what they are interested in...sometimes jigging will turn them away, other times a slow lift will trigger them, or sometimes they want it just hanging motionless...a sonar will clue you into what they want quickly...not to mention you will know if there are fish under you or not!  If you have the mobility of a snomobile and you aren't marking or catching fish within 30 mins of trying a spot, then move!  My problem is that I am always on foot and it's a loooong walk out to catch those fish on Simcoe and generally once you are setup you're not going to move too much...it's not exactly pleasant to keep moving around on foot! hehe  Keep at it, you're fortunate to be able to have easy access and be able to get out as frequently as you can.  Tony"
