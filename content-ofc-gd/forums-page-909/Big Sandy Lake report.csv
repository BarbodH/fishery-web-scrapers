Today was very different....Nothing...lol...well I guess at a stretch you could say i avoided the skunk and landed my first smelt through the ice....A PB!!!!lol   I don’t know whether it was just one of those days.......or the fact that the fish don’t hang out there this time of year...I’ve only fished that spot in March/April. Could be one or the other or both factors.   Its a little worrying as Big Sandy Lake is the venue for the 2nd day of the NWO meet up this weekend, thought I’d do a sneaky pre-fish. On the other hand it has helped because i think now i will suggest the reef 1st instead of that spot.    There were tons of smelt down there , just like in March last year, its just that the trout and whitefish were nowhere to be seen.....and believe me i tried just about every lure/bait combination for both species...Tube Jigs, airplane jigs, large/small sucker minnows , large small dace minnows but i was on a hiding to nothing, as i did not even see a fish on sonar that wasn't a smelt.       WAS KINDA GREY TODAY           LOTS OF SMELT DOWN THERE                 AVOIDED THE SKUNK....LOL          <embed width=""448"" height=""361"" type=""application/x-shockwave-flash"" wmode=""transparent"" src=""http://i263.photobucket.com/player.swf?file=http://vid263.photobucket.com/albums/ii158/vishuscirquel/smelt.flv"">      Hope Sunday is better...cant get worse....lol....oh yeah...it could...we might not even get a smelt!        ."
295558,Leecher,2009-01-22 02:36:00,7832,"Simon, got to hate that when it happens       but looks like you got some more pre fishing to do in that area.... sometimes it's hard to locate them, but I'm sure you'll prevail  Nice job on the PB LOL and keep it up Jacques"
295561,rickster,2009-01-22 02:42:00,495,Even after this report I am still bummed I can't make it this weekend. Damn work  Dave and Sandy are coming down this weekend so I hope  to take Dave out to Lake of the woods for some Crappie Sunday.  Hope you have a great weekend  Rick
295565,Terry,2009-01-22 02:48:00,14456,skunked  snags don't count....LOL
295576,Greencoachdog,2009-01-22 02:59:00,8163,"That's what you get for cheatin' Simon!  ... you can't even count that Smelt, because it was foul hooked!!!  I wish you much better luck for this weekend!!!"
295578,brkygetr,2009-01-22 03:02:00,425, Hey Rick I was up to Nestor last Sat...apparently the fishing had been good but between 3 of us we came home with 10 fish...complete waste of time...and no size either. Morans bay...BIG crappie in there.  And we will get the trout and whities Simon...if i gotta drill 50 holes myself we will find them.
295580,snag,2009-01-22 03:04:00,1932,  DO TOO!
295583,rickster,2009-01-22 03:10:00,495,"  this will be my first trip to Nestor in 3 years but easier to getto now that the road is in good shape I usually go to NWB and fish 3 sisters....bigger fish found a nice little lake East of fort last year caught seven crappie in about an hour but four were around 15""  gonna try it next weekend   Good luck this weekend"
295738,limeyangler,2009-01-22 13:33:00,5204,   Its not cheating in Europe...lol   anyway...thanks ...might just need that luck...but we have some good fishemen coming......i'm sure they can succeed where i failed....lol.
