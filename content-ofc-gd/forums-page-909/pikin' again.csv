295304,b2kptbo,2009-01-21 11:34:00,1505,"Yes a nice healthy pike, good work..."
295310,tinbanger,2009-01-21 13:27:00,1028,nice fish  Have yet to catch to catch a pike thru the ice .. but that would involve actually going and trying  TB
295318,Leecher,2009-01-21 13:44:00,7832,Great report and pics waterwolf  Real beautiful pike.... Congratulations Did she take a few runs before you were able to land it on ice? Jacques
295328,Clampet,2009-01-21 14:05:00,1947,It's nice to know it returned unscathed.
295405,BassAsin,2009-01-21 20:02:00,806,nice and healthy lookin too! good job!
295516,snag,2009-01-22 00:05:00,1932,Sweet!
295517,waterwolf,2009-01-22 00:12:00,556,"yes jacques , she fought like a freight train . this really surprised me 'cause she hit very lightly 3 times . expected a hammer.  set  the hook on the third tap and she took a good off on a good run . thank god for braid  . she was still making some strong  runs once she got near the hole ,, that's hard on any line. got a 39in. outta this same lake {pond almost] last year and ""heard ""  someone released a 44in. that'll keep you out there  a bit longer even on the slow days ."
295537,Leecher,2009-01-22 01:27:00,7832, Cool.... got to love them big gators to react that way.    It seems that the snot rockets gulps your bait and takes off but the big girls somehow will sniff it out first before taking off like a freight train.  and yes it will  have you stay a little longer out there on a slow day for sure.  Again congratulations on a beauty catch Jacques
295625,limeyangler,2009-01-22 03:52:00,5204,Great stuff waterwolf...nice pike(s)   I am still amazed at the variations in markings/colour of fish from lake to lake.
295654,waterwolf,2009-01-22 04:47:00,556,thanks for the spelling check clamp-it.. it was  getting to be a long day at 18 or so hrs.  i'm up every day at 5:20.  good to know your payin' attention.  i should hit the sack soon or i might make another spelling error it's another 18 hr. day.  thanks
