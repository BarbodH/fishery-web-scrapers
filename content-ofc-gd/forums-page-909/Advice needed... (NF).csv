295321,Gerritt,2009-01-21 13:51:00,6129,"My father rang me up from Alberta (Camrose) to ask me every little boys dream.... Would I like his perfectly restored 1984 Harley Davidson Police Special.... (This was the last year the shovelhead was made apparently)  Him and I went on alot of memorable trips on that bike when I was a youngster... it has just been fully restored... But he NEEDS it gone due to divorce...  What would be the best way to get it here?  I looked at flying out, then renting a truck to bring it back... 2300.00 for the truck one way and 179.00 for the flight.....  Driving out and back, I loose a weeks wages and am looking at about 1500.00 in fuel and hotels..  Shipping it here.... only quote I received is about 1000.00 from Calgary (300+ kms from Camrose) to Toronto...  has anyone every shipped a vehicle within Canada? if so can you recommend a shipping company? I really do not feel like putting my faith in a shipping company I found on the internet for a $15,000.00 motorcycle...  Thanks in advance guys!  G."
295329,danbouck,2009-01-21 14:05:00,4380,Just spoke to my shipping guy and he said to use Trand FRT McNamara and it would be about $500 depending on how easy it is to load and unload.

295350,tinbanger,2009-01-21 14:54:00,1028,Had a buddy ship his 71 mustang from Calgary to Toronto two years ago for $750 . 10 years prior to that he had used them to ship from toronto to calgary . was a good experience both times  he used Searail 1-888-456-5558  that included trucking from Calgary to Edmonton then by rail to Toronto.  We will want to see pics of the bike when you get it.  TB
295357,shane,2009-01-21 15:08:00,652,Wow.  Too bad it's the middle of winter.  I'd fly out there and drive it home for you.  No charge.
295396,Uncle Buck,2009-01-21 18:39:00,1000,"Gerritt, Check out via Train... my bro shipped his intrepid to Calgary from here when he moved...  I'll look into it further for ya"
295399,Beans,2009-01-21 19:02:00,3339,"Can't help you with the shipping but I thought you might enjoy this:  TURPENTINE VS HOLY WATER  A little boy was sitting on the curb with a gallon of turpentine,shaking it up and watching all the bubbles. A while later a Priest came along and asked the little boy what he had. The little boy replied, 'This is the most powerful liquid in the world, it's called turpentine.' The Priest said, 'No, the most powerful liquid in the world is Holy Water. If you take some of this Holy Water and rub it on a pregnant woman's belly, she'll pass a healthy baby.' The little boy replied, 'You take some of this turpentine and rub it on a cat's ass, he'll pass a Harley Davidson.'"
295408,Rattletrap2,2009-01-21 20:27:00,1652,"Gerritt, I'm having a brain fart and can't remember the company, but John Derringer on Q107 ships his bike out to the West Coast with this company. He always raves about the great service and care they take with his Harley. I haven't heard the ads for a while now, but someone must remember the company?  You are a lucky fellow....now get her and bring her back home!"
295411,dp3200,2009-01-21 20:45:00,31,"If you are going to ship it, I can't urge you enough to use a company that comes recommended by someone you trust.  I have had 2 awful experiences. I also have a friend who has had an awful experience.  Don't just go with the cheapest place!"
295629,2 tone z71,2009-01-22 03:59:00,1311,"hey Congrats G thats awesome,not much help on the shipping but can make room in the trailer if ya wanna do Bike week in Daytona next yr"
