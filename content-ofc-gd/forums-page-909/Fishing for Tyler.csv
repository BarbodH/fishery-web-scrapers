266810,motv8tr,2008-11-12 22:35:00,2587,"Hey all, soon it will be that time again  First of all, thanks to John's son-in-law, Fishing for Tyler has it's own Logo now   and I believe the Team fron Extreme Angler TV will be joining us again    For those of you new to the board this year, Fishing for Tyler is a fundraising ice fishing tournament that is held for a young lad with Autism...and a fun day for all who attend  This year it will be held on Sat. Feb 14.  I realize it's Valentines day, but it's also the license free weekend   .  As usual things will begin at 7am and measurements at 1 I think, plenty of time to get everyone home in time to be with their honies  There will be more info coming but for now I am looking for volunteers to help with some things.  I've finally realized and accepted I need more help...this event keeps growing  I need help with setting up, signing people in, setting up prizes, I think I've got the cooks covered , I'd like it if someone could be a photographer for me...oh I'll need someone to measure the fish when they come in too.   If you think you can help with anything I would really appreciate it...just let me know  There will of course be more info later.....  Maureen"

267177,tjsa,2008-11-13 22:28:00,1578," Hey Maureen, do you still have the jpeg maps of the directions I sent you last year? I may not have sent them to you, may have just replied in the post for people asking directions. If not, I can e-mail them to you. This event will eventually get ""pinned"" again, for all to check out.  Are you still asking for assistance for prize donations? If so, start it now, and I might just remember to actually send you something for the table. I think I still have your PO box address around here somewhere.  I will not be there of course, unless you want to pay my airfare(return included), food, accommodations, bail,    :lol:"

267204,motv8tr,2008-11-13 23:12:00,2587," Tom, not sure if I still have that map or not, I think you posted it for me.  A thread will be pinned in the middle of Jan. this is just a heads up for now.  As for prizes, I'm always on the lookout for those   But I will send you a PM with my mailing address, I no longer have a P.O. Box.  And sad to say I don't have bail money, but I do have a guestroom and plenty of food  Maureen"
