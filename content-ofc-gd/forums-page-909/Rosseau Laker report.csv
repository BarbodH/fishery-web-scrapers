295161,Grimace,2009-01-21 00:31:00,2020,"Nice Rosseau report.   That laker is a beauty.   Sure was Hungry.    Where did you get that nice batch of minnows, generous people like that deserve a good plug."
295169,johnnyb,2009-01-21 00:38:00,3413,"Grimace, you're right...but from what I gather of the young lad serving me, his dad running the business might get a bit ticked off if he saw it     It was more like I happened to be there late enough, and the kid wasn't interested in counting out minnows.  I actually had to tell him to stop when he was about to dump the rest of the net's contents in my bucket!"
295173,misfish,2009-01-21 00:43:00,29133," Chineese new years,CRAB LEGS.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,SWEET.Was there Friday night. Nothing but crabs and mussels and shrimp and dim sum here.  That last pic is AMAZING."

295195,Cudz,2009-01-21 01:35:00,2652,How did you cook that herring? Would it be considered pickled already?
294847,johnnyb,2009-01-20 02:31:00,3413,"The lovely Laker Jessy decided that not only did I need to brush up on my ice-fishing skills if I’m going to be of any competition to her this winter, but that I should also have a “guy’s weekend”.  So this past Saturday night, my cousin Bert (on the board as Bicephalic) and I headed up to Muskoka for some Lake Rosseau trout action.  It was, in fact, his first time ice-fishing, and we had been looking forward to getting out there for quite a while. I tried not to talk up my spot too much…really didn’t want to jinx anything.  We stopped for bait on the way up, and ended up with an absolute gob of minnows, that was deemed to be one dozen…not bad for $5, so I figured it was a good sign.  Sunday morning had us walking out to a spot I’ve always done well at…and up to our knees in snow.  Made it past one slushy spot, which is almost always a bit slushy…then found our way into some really nasty stuff.  Thank goodness Bert’s boots were waterproof all the way up…mine on the other hand were letting a bit of water in over the top of the rubber section.  We found hard ice, popped a few holes, and my feet seemed to be staying warm enough.  Bert set to cleaning the holes, which were welling up like springs!  After losing only one fish and landing none, we started exploring, looking for some more firm ice.  Getting around a point and into the wind, we found some solid stuff and drilled a few holes.  His first time out, and Bert’s already figuring out clever ways to block the wind!  Don’t know if it was that we found the right colour, after switching lures frequently, but just around lunch time, Bert nailed his first laker ever – a solid 21 incher!  PB!!!     Not long after, I narrowly missed becoming a statistic when I saw my rod getting pulled toward the hole – dove for it just in time and hung on to reel in a 23 incher…but forgot my Tourney sign – d’oh!     No worries...I'll get a bigger one next time.    After that, the action quieted down, and by about 5:00 we decided to get off the ice.   We slugged our way back home through even more slush, and had the joy of discovering what sticky wet snow does to a jetsled loaded with too much crap!  The upside was we burned enough calories to justify another Angus burger on the way home. Speaking of calories, the gory pic that follows is what was inside the fish I brought in…by my estimation a herring that was ¾ as long as the trout, plus a smallmouth fry and another shiner.  Now where did I put my Musky tubes?... "
294848,steverowbotham,2009-01-20 02:34:00,1800,"thats wild, makes ya wonder"
294850,irishfield,2009-01-20 02:36:00,26272,I see Bert was using Jessy's lucky rod! lol  Musky gear eh.. who would of thought! lol
294852,Raf,2009-01-20 02:39:00,3495,great job  not really surprised at the contents of its belly.  lakers are a top predator and winter is their 'time' - comfortable temps for them throughout the water column.  they'll eat stuff from tiny crustaceans to smaller game fish.  whateaver's available.
294853,mbac31,2009-01-20 02:44:00,904,Trout are a top predator. I have cleaned Brook Trout down in Labrador with small mice and even got a large one before with a small rat. They will eat anything.
294857,solopaddler,2009-01-20 02:45:00,8605,I'll bet that laker felt exactly like I did when I came home from the Mandarin last night.
294860,douG,2009-01-20 02:46:00,2693,"I once took 12 1/2 in of back bones out of the gut of a 27 in lake trout, no head and no tail, just spine bones.  That means that the 2 ft laker ate a fish about 16 in long.  All at once too also.  Nom nom nom.  The cutest lil top predators under the hardwater, they is.  And solopaddler, when it comes to The Mandarin, just say no, never again, no good reason, I know I'll feel like crap afterward, done it  before, no need for a repeat.  Stop the madness already, as it were.   Hope this hleps."
294862,mbac31,2009-01-20 02:52:00,904,   I've been there
294865,Sinker,2009-01-20 02:56:00,8692,"Wild eh?  Its true though, they'll eat anything.  My brother caught a 9lb laker one time up near port loring. We kept it, and upon cleaning it, found a 2lb smallie in its belly. Friggen unreal!  Thanks for the report, Sinker"
294866,snag,2009-01-20 02:58:00,1932,Nice 2 4 1!
294867,DRIFTER_016,2009-01-20 03:01:00,10439, All spazzed out on MSG??
294874,Joey,2009-01-20 03:06:00,9122,Unbelievable     Talk about gorging.  I knew they ate alot at this time but I am surprised they would eat such a large fish for their size.  Well ya learn something new everyday doncha  Great report.  Joey
294883,camillj,2009-01-20 03:11:00,1988,Nice !  Just gotta love Rosseau for lakers ... I had one come up (about that size) bitten almost half-way through .... top predator became prey while it was thrashing about on the line ....
294892,snag,2009-01-20 03:32:00,1932," Gorging,  O.k. I'll restrain myself.  But I am with you here Joey. I had no idea"
294907,Greencoachdog,2009-01-20 03:51:00,8163,I quit reading this report the very instant I realized that the lovely LJ wasn't going to be in it!!!    Not with that kind of attitude you won't!!!   That was just an ok report compared to the ones with LJ kickin' yer butt in the fish dept!!!   
294945,Whitespinnerbait,2009-01-20 11:42:00,2038,"I caught a 3lb laker once ...  It had a douzen or so minnows , a handful of crayfish and a cigarette '' Butt '' in its belly ..         Nice report BTW"
294951,bicephalic,2009-01-20 12:25:00,112," Hey now - just because I'm not sprawled on the bow of a boat in a bikini is no reason to discriminate!   Next time I'll fish with no shirt on, so it's a more 'natural' experience for you  Now with that outta the way -  Thanks again John - I'm already re-arranging my gear for the next outing <G>  A few more pics from the day:    Something I've learned is a potentially bad habit:   Post fish - Mark 'the spot'!     That's what I love about your first time hooking into a species - it's ALWAYS the PB"
294979,corvette1,2009-01-20 13:45:00,1765,congrats on your laker outing that little pig
294986,lunkerbasshunter,2009-01-20 13:55:00,2585,very cool pics!!!!!  cheers!
295001,johnnyb,2009-01-20 14:26:00,3413,"GCD -- don't worry, LJ and I will be out this Friday  Bicephalic -- can't wait to do it again"
295021,tbayboy,2009-01-20 14:57:00,1497,Very cool in a gruesome kind of way.  Amazing what they'll shove down their throats.
295022,limeyangler,2009-01-20 15:00:00,5204,"Why cant all trout be that greedy!!!!   great stuff JB, eagerly awaiting your next instalment.   Cheers."
295024,Zubris21,2009-01-20 15:02:00,563,"Awesome report!  I love checking out the fish's stomach to see what they've been munching on.  Gotta say Im pretty surprised by that fish's content.  Hard to believe it was hungry for your lure too.  When I was in Quebec fishing for lakers last spring the bite was really slow.  When we opened the stomachs of the ones we caught, they were absolutely jammed with fly larvae.  I think they were black fly, from what I understand black fly larva hatch on bottom then float to the surface in a small air bubble?  can anyone confirm or deny this?"
295025,Leecher,2009-01-20 15:04:00,7832,"Great report and pics johnnyb  Sweet deal on the dozen of minnows.... can't go wrong with that Congratulations to Bert on his first and PB  Like others said, amazing that she still wanted more Good job you guys and thanks for sharing Leechman"
295072,Moosebunk,2009-01-20 19:07:00,3970,I like that.  Good li'l laker report right thar.  Them's fish are gluttons.
