295104,Big Cliff,2009-01-20 22:04:00,6899,"We don't have a Sobeys here in Lindsay but we do have a Food Basics so I'll be checking in there tomorrow. When I was in the army we had a lot of guys from down East in our outfit and they often talked about ""boiled dinners"", ""salt beef"", and a lot of other things that sounded so good.  Sue and I have always wanted to spend a few months visiting but have never had the chance but perhaps with a bit of help I can experience the fine dining  Anyone can tell from looking at me that I love to eat LOL!"
295131,misfish,2009-01-20 23:16:00,29133,"Let me guess,Cod toung and cheeks with soggy bread ,chips dressing and gravy?LOL Dont be trying that stuff Cliff.You wont get in the door,or is that out? LOL  Any questions, feel free to pm. Enjoy"
295132,Big Cliff,2009-01-20 23:19:00,6899,"Want to come live at my place? Free rent, you cook!"
295133,misfish,2009-01-20 23:35:00,29133," Do I get to sit in your tree stand? LOL  Just to add Cliff. Make sure the bucket says NAVEL CURED BEEF,NOT RIBBLETS. I havent seen the ribblets for along time,so Im guessing they stopped doing them."
295143,Big Cliff,2009-01-20 23:59:00,6899,"Thanks! I'll let you know what I find tomorrow.  As far as sitting in my tree stand, might be able to work something out there, I only ever use it for 2 or 3 days a year LOL.  PS Still got a bunch of stuff here for you.

295302,mbac31,2009-01-21 10:50:00,904,Great looking meal. Only thing missing Brian is the Sweet Mustard Pickles. Great now I'm hungry.
294222,misfish,2009-01-18 22:41:00,29133,"Like I said before, I love to cook and I figured I would start to share. Some here will know this meal, as they are from the east coast and know what this taste is all about. For me ,it just keeps me intouch with my family heritage and brings back so many memories.  Ok lets begin,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,  First you need a good ol bucket of salt meat,     Then you cut and chop up all yer veggies. Taters and turnip and carrots and some greens. Cabbage for us.     In a large pot you get the water boiling and add in as much beef as you want. Remember,this is a salt brine cure so the more you add,the saltier it will be. If it,s too salty to the taste,you can add more water,or just drain some out and add.    While the meat boils for about 3 hours,lets start on my secret sauce. Well it wont be so secret now.LOL In a small pot you melt 1/3 pound of butter,add in 1/2 a larger finely chopped white onion,with a good helpping of the best savory money can buy.     Allow the butter to melt and stir in the savory and onion. Cook til the onion is close to tender.     Turn off and start the next step.  The roasting chicken.  Since this bird had a large cavity,I was able to make a small stuffing for it. I went with a sesime/carway bread and added in some chopped cashews. I also stired in some of the savory/onion butter melt. Once I had the bird stuffed I basted it with the butter.  It,s now ready for the oven. 50 minutes at 375 covered,basting half way,then 30 minutes uncovered,basted once aswell.    Now back to the boiling. Once the meat is tender and can be pulled apart with a fork,it,s time to let it rest and add the veggies to the water.    Timing is everything here. First you start with the turnip. Let it boil for 15-20 minutes. The in goes the carrots. Same, 15 minutes,then add in the taters. Allow to boil for 20 minutes then add in the last of the veggies,the cabbage. Quartering works best. Look they are happy happy.    When all the veggies are close to being cooked,just add back the beef to warm it up.    Ok now back to the roasted bird.  Yep it,s done, and look at this nice split. Oh the dressing.    Now for the gravy.  Simple really. The left over basting,I add a cup of the boiled stock and add some robinhood gravy flour. Wisk til a nice smooth blend.    After all this, you have  VOILA  Dinner for two.Well it was for 4,but the oldest came over to collect his feed before we sat down. These boys can smell this stuff 3600 miles away.LOL       Hope you enjoyed. Brian"

294257,misfish,2009-01-18 23:42:00,29133," Oh ,so you want to see me in an apron too eh? LOL You live by the fast track I know that. You just may get a glimps first before Joe.LOL"

294264,Vtucciarone,2009-01-18 23:53:00,38,BY GEEZ!!!!!!  Where's the Purity hard bread to soak up some of that liquor.
294268,misfish,2009-01-18 23:58:00,29133, Thats one thing I was never fond of.
294282,Sinker,2009-01-19 00:16:00,8692,"My son, you'll make a good wife one a dese days!!  Looks some shockin good bye, we had the same thing, only roast pork!! MMMMMMMMM  I needed it after shoveling, blowing, and plowing snow all day!!  By the looks of it, I'll get to do it all again tomorrow!!!  Sinker"
294296,Radnine,2009-01-19 00:36:00,1538,"Looks yummy. For the uneduacted (me) what is ""savory""? Thanks for the post. Jim"
294298,misfish,2009-01-19 00:37:00,29133,"Hey Shane. Tiz good eats no dought for sure. I was going to do a peas pudd,n ,next time.  Thanks all. I hope to try and do this once a week for the next two months. It,s a project Im working on. Just looking for feed back. The best feed back will be if you cook what I made and try it. If you would like to add something to the recipe,please feel free. Let me know what you did to make it your own. Thanks"
294315,Greencoachdog,2009-01-19 01:01:00,8163,Why did you need 2 meats???... wasn't the chicken enough?  Do you realize how much extra cholesterol that is???  ... no wonder you were fat as a hog!!!... and it looks like yer heading that way again!!!   ... just an observation...
294319,Rich,2009-01-19 01:06:00,3927,Looks delicious. A lot of effort went into that meal and a lot of effort went into telling us about it. I can't speak for everybody but I know I really appreciate that and I'm sure most others here do too.  Thanks!
294325,misfish,2009-01-19 01:10:00,29133,"Do yer home work. Chicken is protien. The rest is calories. I,ll work it off Monday night. Maybe you would like to come on up and chuck some wieghts with me??  Maybe I need to show ya a pic from back then and now for ya."
294327,misfish,2009-01-19 01:12:00,29133,  Thanks Rich.
294334,misfish,2009-01-19 01:26:00,29133," Ok heres an honest answer to ya Glenn. The salt beef is a treat,like candy. It,s bad for ya,but it tastes so good. Why we boil the veggies in the broth,flavor. The salt is pretty mush light by the time you put them in. There was a time the broth could not be salty enough,memart still adds salt to his veggies.LOL  The chicken adds  balance to the meal. The gravy is a bit much as well,but it is so good. The dressing you will notice I said seisme and caraway with nuts. Very healthy.   During the week, me and the mrs,s eat healthy,at times we like to splurge,but trust me,there is no going back to a generously proportioned for this guy. Lean and trim and healthy. We do moderate our intake."
294343,Greencoachdog,2009-01-19 01:35:00,8163,"I unnerstan now Bubba... pig out on the weekends!!!  So the salt beef isn't far from being corned beef?... I love that stuff (corned beef), but we only have it 2 or 3 times a year. That's how I do a corned beef brisket, boil it with taters, carrots, and cabbage. Then I put the brisket in the oven with a brown sugar and spicey mustard glaze for aboot 45 min. ... I always eat too much of that!!!"
294345,misfish,2009-01-19 01:39:00,29133," Please,do not insult the salt beef.LOL They are close,but the salt beef is much superior. And no,we dont pig out.LOL  Dinner for two. Half a chicken and veggies and a bit of salt beef.Oh and gravy  "
294488,Big Cliff,2009-01-19 09:53:00,6899,"If I had meals like that being put in front of me they wouldn't be calling me Big Cliff anymore. That looks and sounds so good! Where do you get the pails of salt beaf in this part of the country? I don't think I have ever seen it in any of our grocery stores or butcher shops? I have often heard about ""salt beaf dinners"" got to try it one of these days.  Thanks for sharing that with us!"
294521,Headhunter,2009-01-19 14:07:00,5703,"That looks delicious Brian, however, I'm getting gas just looking at the cabbage! LOL HH"

294551,douG,2009-01-19 15:16:00,2693,"Jigg's Dinner is what it is.  Savoury is a herb.  I might like some mustard pickle alongside, got some o dat der b'y?"
294558,Cookslav,2009-01-19 15:26:00,1457,"Love it! Jigs dinner is great! Nothing like a home cooked meal, especialy when its such and eastern classic on a cold winters day."
294708,misfish,2009-01-19 22:24:00,29133,"Hey Cliff You can pick the buckets up at Sobeys,or food basic and zhers carries it aswell.The are two sizes.Thats the small 4 pound bucket I posted. That will do for two meals.  We use to have a store that had 5 gallon pails of it and let me pick what we wanted."
