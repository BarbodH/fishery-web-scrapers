295364,kickingfrog,2009-01-21 15:47:00,8333,Ice Fishing Lake Simcoe for lakers and whitefish.  Does anybody have any experience with the operators out of Oro or Oro Station?  Thanks
295378,glen,2009-01-21 16:48:00,2641,http://www.fishinontario.com/icefishing/la...inesicefishing/  I used to go to the pines in Oro about 10 years ago so things could have changed.  Ask about the size of the hut you will get when you call them.  I had good fishing in that spot.  Do you need a hut for sure?  Maybe if it is warmer you can just fish outside. Good luck Kickingfrog.
295388,kickingfrog,2009-01-21 17:37:00,8333,Thanks Glen. My brother is springing for a hut. Sort of a new daddy celebration gift (or maybe he thinks I'm getting old).
