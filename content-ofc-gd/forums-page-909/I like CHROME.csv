295426,kemper,2009-01-21 21:28:00,2232,"Not a fish this time, sorry guys.  I have another kind of chrome, picked it up as a christmas present for myself and man do I like it.  Raven Vectra SST 3, with custom handles that Im in the process of working on. I think a darker stain with a slight reddish tinge is gonna look cool. Pulled the bearings and degreased/sewing machine oiled and now it spins forever. Raven claims that this is the lightest pin out there, but so do a few other companies so who knows (who cares?) but it is damn light (like 6.8g light). The startup is just stupid fast, and it basically fishes itself. I really like the twist knob that controls the bearings, this was I can actually adjust it for different flows mid drift with no tools, wonderful idea. I have only had it out a couple times (all was around -10) and it performed like magic, so far I am really happy with it.  I happen to like Raven products, they offer good value and when you are paying 18 K a year for school value is key! I owned a matrix before this, and it was cheap but a really solid little pin. Never gave me troubles and worked flawlessly until the day I sold it. Reel matches up perfectly with my custom build St Croix, as it is a very light rod.  Heres some pics          See ya on the river"
295440,Greencoachdog,2009-01-21 21:59:00,8163,Reel Snazzy there Kemp!!!  ... but can it catch fish???
295442,dobee,2009-01-21 22:00:00,301,"nice reel kemp.. im in the market for a new reel also, and was looking into the sst-3.....  looks nice!"
295449,kemper,2009-01-21 22:15:00,2232," Ah, Glen...  It aint the reel that catches the fish!"
295450,MCTFisher9120,2009-01-21 22:16:00,3761,I know nothing about river fishing gear but that looks like a kick   reel.
295454,solopaddler,2009-01-21 22:20:00,8605,"They're a good reel and light, but be careful with it. You can bend the main shaft and knock it out of true by simply torquing down on a salmon. Don't ever drop it either...."
295456,kemper,2009-01-21 22:25:00,2232,"  Im crazy careful with my reels, the last one was sold without even the smallest scratch.  Good to know about that center shaft though, I had heard that it was easy to bend, but also heard that it wasnt.  I dont battle alot of salmon anyways, and I have a beater set up for that."
295459,Greencoachdog,2009-01-21 22:31:00,8163,"  Well if you don't catch any,  that's what you'll be blaming it on!!!"
295462,kemper,2009-01-21 22:34:00,2232,"  Its never the reels fault...however jigs, roe bags, flys, worms, minnows and other bait may be blamed!"
295478,drwxr,2009-01-21 22:59:00,453,i always blame the weatherman...
295493,Victor,2009-01-21 23:22:00,1609,"nice kemper ... i know how you feel, got my 1st pin (aventa) as a gift from the gf half a year ago and i take it out from time to time just to spin it and play with it... got real busy with school so i have yet to take it out to the river  we gotta get together sometime and you can hook me up with some chrome!"
295494,Victor,2009-01-21 23:23:00,1609,o and btw ... it seems that you haven't christened her yet? let us know when you do!
295495,kemper,2009-01-21 23:26:00,2232,"oh i christened her, one nice one and a few tiny buggers.  shes gonna get a workout this spring though!  Well get out for sure, just let me know"
295510,MJL,2009-01-21 23:56:00,2427,"Great acquisition Kemper.  Hard to go wrong with a Raven.   Victor, maybe this year you can try getting your tongue stuck to the Aventa"
295569,BillM,2009-01-22 02:53:00,17367,Nice reel Kemper!  I think I am going to de-virginize my Ang Spec this weekend.  I can't take it anymore.
295585,Burtess,2009-01-22 03:11:00,901," Nice reel but ~6.5oz, 184g....  Burt"
295609,limeyangler,2009-01-22 03:39:00,5204,  DITTO......   Looks like a great piece of kit there Kemps!
295627,Sinker,2009-01-22 03:53:00,8692,  I'll have to save that reply for later!!!!  A spinning reel will catch the same fish!!!!!  Sure is nice looking though.........  Sinker
295636,kemper,2009-01-22 04:12:00,2232,  i knew something seemed off about that figure.  dang metric  thanks
295637,kemper,2009-01-22 04:14:00,2232," I agree it will, I caught alot of steelhead before I went to a pin.  I will say, however that the pin is MUCH more effective at controlling the drift, and getting the bait to the fish."
295822,NAC,2009-01-22 17:22:00,369,"They are an excellent reel for the money Kemper. I specifically bought mine for the weight because I have a superlight old 13' GL2 that I use it with.  No disappointment whatsoever, even after I bounced it off the rocks once!  Bought new bearings immediately after, but haven't needed to replace them because it still spins like a top. I've only used an Aventa and Islander in the past and am still partial to this one.    Fall spawner. "
295833,jdmls,2009-01-22 17:50:00,575,Tomorrow is gonna see +1 .... Get that thing worked in
295860,kemper,2009-01-22 20:20:00,2232," Ha, dude oshawa is frozen...COMPLETELY.  Id need an auger, and at this rate is gonna stay that way till june.  Is the kingpin in yet? I cant wait to see that thing in action."
