295199,NAC,2009-01-21 01:46:00,369,I kept waiting for something big to come and slam those small fish as they reeled them in...  Good to see more exposure for the sport!  I heard there's a kayak fishing movie going to be released soon and that there's an Ontario pro involved in it.  Also heard of some kayak fishing events in Ontario this summer.

295430,jediangler,2009-01-21 21:33:00,1923,"Hey Nomad, keep us updated on any yakfishing tournaments you hear of here in Ontario. Have you had any luck with starting your own?"
295434,bukee,2009-01-21 21:47:00,58,"Last night when I checked WFN, I saw a bunch of guys fishing in kayaks, looked like fun.  Then one guy took a lure to the chin, watched for five minutes as they tried to cut the hooks to get it out of his chin.  Looked painful, but he was quite the sport about it."
295466,forrest,2009-01-21 22:39:00,1032,In one shot I thought I saw that guy standing up in his kayak.  Is that right?
295472,FishHeadRic,2009-01-21 22:52:00,226,I stand up in mine all the time. Sit on top kayaks are very stable. l'm actually working on an out-rigger this winter so l can work my flyrod and do some sight casting.  FHR
295473,solopaddler,2009-01-21 22:52:00,8605," As a former O.R.C.A. certified canoe instructor I'd have to say no.  As crazy bush whacking wilderness paddler I'd say sure why not?  .  If anyone's seen Bill Masons classic ""Waterwalker"", there's a scene where he stands up and walks back and forth in his canoe in the middle of class 3 rapids.  Once when I was alone on the Albany I attempted to do the same thing. (Didn't work out too well  )"
295474,irishfield,2009-01-21 22:54:00,26272,Come on Mike.. if you can't stand up in one should you be using one ! lol
295485,purekgw,2009-01-21 23:11:00,585,i have demoed a few SOT and they are very stable
295487,Jigger,2009-01-21 23:13:00,1237,The guy holding the pike at about 3;20 looks kindof familiar. 'Hook in the shadows?
295506,FishHeadRic,2009-01-21 23:49:00,226,Check out this yak from Freedom Kayaks.     FHR
295515,snag,2009-01-22 00:01:00,1932,"When I'm alone in a canoe, I stand 60% of the time while casting. My body doesn't like sitting for long periods.  I can cast and see better standing.  Of course the canoe has to be the proper rocker, though my balance is good in most.  Safety is key.  I've never tipped."
