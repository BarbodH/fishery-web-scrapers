295486,Billy - Curtiss,2009-01-21 23:12:00,241,Just got off the phone with a buddy and we talked about the notion of hitting upstate New York for maybe 4 days of fishing / camping sometime this summer. The Adirondack Park Preserve apparently boasts some 3000 fishable lakes and ponds. Neither of us have ever fished in the US and it would be a fun and welcome change of scenery. I'm wondering if there are any species indigenous to the area that can't be found in Ontario. Has anybody ever fished this area before? Any recommendations on good camping spots in close proximity to potentially stellar fishing holes? Any insight would be amazing!

The authorities are much more pro-active than here and the Adirondaks is policed thoroughly.  There are some great camp sites right beside the mountain streams and rivers.  Have fun!"
