With no reliable means to get out to it ( 45 min walk one way) and no fish it was a waste.  This year he and a buddy put it about a km out from Beaverton 'near some orange huts"" which obviously are rentals. Also just off the 'road' that Hales runs thier yellow taxis out on so we should be good to drive out . Looking good for perchin with the kids this year !  Will post some photos next week as we are thinkin of heading out on the weekend ( assuming I can find it) Will try and find something unique ( maybe work related) around the house to stick on the hut so any OFNRs in the area can drop by and say hi. Just a ratty Blue hut in need of a new door with an aluminum roof right now.  TB"
