50058,chilli,2007-03-21 17:52:00,199,"I just got a call from Gary Boroughs. He was pretty snarky insisting I am part of a big misunderstanding. When I asked why fishing must remain in the wording he said it doesn't matter because it's fenced off so no one can go in now. Apparently a local is pressuring them to let him fish there as he has done for the past 30 or so years so the word angling stays.  I told him I'll still oppose it if they don't add picnicing and camping to the wording. He snarled ""fine I'll add your letter to the meeting next week, good day"".  Rick I'm hoping you'll take the lead on this one and register as a delegation. All you need to do is convince council to make a small ammendment in the wording. Gary assured me that the property will be private very soon but also stated that this is not a precedent for them. I'm not sure when the meeting is and didn't ask him as he was obviously unhappy with my dissagreement.  Dan"
50073,chilli,2007-03-21 18:23:00,199,"Just called the Mayor back and straightened something out. There is one angler that inspired this bi law. They created this to appease one Town resident and possibly the Mayor himself. This will be a private little fishing area for residents only because one guy said he's fished there for years and shouldn't have to stop for vandals and litterbugs.  I got a name and told the Mayor I'll have the OFAH contact this guy to let him know what is actually being done to allow him his honey hole until the Ferry purchases the property. The law is necessary in the towns eyes in the event that the Ferry deal falls through. Hopefully when this guy realizes the can of worms the Town is opening for him, he'll understand. Still the issue will be there.  Imagine that! One guy puts up a fuss so instead of closing off the whole area like they were planning, they create this permit system for residents only   Dan"

Here is a copy of it, although I'm sure that all who sent him an email in protest to this proposal will receive the same.  March 3, 2007  Gentlemen  Sorry for the late response this time.  I know your disappointment.  As a sometimes fisherman, I know the joys and sorrows of sport fishing.  In fact, as I write this I am in Florida and can not wait to get my license here to fish for blues etc., from the shore.  Surf fishing is a blast.  Last time I did it however I was unlucky and only got a small shark and cat.  Enough about me.  I hope you will take the time this summer to visit the small lot in question.  Please note that this lot is not a park.  I believe it is zoned institutional for use later on as a Ferry site.  You will see that it is adequate at best for fishing.  Only a 100' or so wide and 50 deep with limited or no parking and zero washroom facilities its primary focus is a wonderful view of the river and Fort Niagara in particular.  Again, the town is hoping that a cross river ferry will be established in 2008/09 which would eliminate it's use for fishing altogether.  This November we will be completing a shore line protection project on a small parkette just north of Riverbeach road.  Altogether we will be establishing a 500' passive park right on the river.  Plans for this parkette shore protection are available at the town's Parks and Recreation Office located at the arena.  I know you understand our dilemma and recognize that what ever happens here will be short term.  If the Ferry service does not materialize, we will take another look at the possible uses for this land.  Kindest regards  Jim Collard councilor, NOTL "

36659,crusty,2007-02-20 02:18:00,83,"When taking a trip to germany in 95,  I inquired about fishing. To my dismay I was informed that 99% of all water was privately maintained and if I wanted to fish in a certain stream, I would have to join the PRIVATE CLUB who maintained that water. Fee's have been common place in europe for years."
36804,camillj,2007-02-20 13:01:00,1988,True Crusty ... and not just in Europe ... hasnt anyone sent their $5 'lottery' ticket for the right to fish (for one fish in one hole on one river) in the Gaspe rivers for Salmon yet ?
36805,camillj,2007-02-20 13:06:00,1988,Dont most of the Provincial parks also have a fee system ? (And all of the conservation Areas) ... personally I'd rather they have a fee and keep fishing 'allowed' than ban it altogether ... or worse yet sell off the land to a developer who will certainly not even allow it ...
36813,pikehunter,2007-02-20 13:33:00,1659,"I'm currently in the middle of a search on the town's website and just found this link in regards to this thread: NOTL council meeting link  I am going to read on further to find any email links to respond to this.

36826,OhioFisherman,2007-02-20 14:00:00,6623,"LOL, here is the whole problem, Lord Mayor? Like god? I don`t have any idea how your laws work up there. We have a small community park here, it is open to everyone. Do they receive federal funds to maintain the parks and access?  Sounds like they want their own exclusive little park."
36860,spanky,2007-02-20 14:55:00,195," They want they're own exclusive everything... they didn't even want a McD's like 10miles from downtown, in the middle of the boonies off a major road into NOTL 'cause ""it will smell like grease""... unless you drive a $50,000 lexus, make 6 figures and own 2 homes mortgage free you're not welcome there- well for 98% of the residents it's like that!!  Gawd i hate that town...."
36871,kennyman,2007-02-20 15:28:00,737,"I sent this to the Mayor (his was addressed accordingly) and all the councillors. I'd suggest everyone tell them how you feel. Let them make the correct decision. Make your voice heard if you want to be listened to! Here is the e-mail I sent.                                                                                                                      Hello,councillor. This is in regards to the recommendations from the February 5, 2007 Parks & Recreation Advisory Committee Meeting, which have been referred to this Council meeting for consideration. The Parks & Recreation Advisory Committee recommends that: (see minutes for complete set of recommendations) A. Town property, known as 113 River Beach Drive, be signed ""Access to Property by Town of Niagara-on-the-Lake Permit Only""; and a permit to use the property for the purpose of fishing, be available for Niagara-on-the-Lake residents. I can't tell you how much I disagree with these actions. As an angler I already have to pay for an Ontario fishing license which entitles me to fish all of Ontarios crown land. Do you know the can of worms (pun intended) you are opening?Should I have to pay an extra fee everytime I go fishing? Should every town,district or county all get a cut? Should I have to get an individual permit for everywhere I fish? Nobody will be able to afford the cost or time involved. For instance if I travel to fifty different destinations during one year should I require fifty different permits? Should I be required to carry a complete library around on my person so if I decide to fish a different area I can produce proof every time?Consider the time and costs associated with this both to the individual and the community.Do you know how many people are anglers sir?It is the one of the worlds most popuar hobbies. How do you think we'll feel about the discrimination being shown by you and your town towards us? What if all anglers stopped coming to your towns businesses because of these actions? What effect will this have? Would that be something positive or constructive for the community you represent? How will the people you are sworn to represent feel when you are adversely effecting virtually every household in your community? How many families do not have an angler among them or at very least their neighbor?Please reconsider your actions in this manner as it will not be taken lightly or accepted well by the fishing community.Please make the right decision in this matter. Thankyou,concerned citizen,Ken(I included my last name as well)."
36874,bigfish1965,2007-02-20 15:33:00,3382,"Lord Mayor is the official term for the Mayor in NOTL. It is actually from England and is the way Mayors are titled there. Many of the older towns still use the designation, though most have shortened it to Mayor. NOTL has a rich history in Canada and is a lovely town. They just practise some very strange politics and have a reputation as being very exclusionary and elitist, which is odd for a town whose principal industry is tourism."
