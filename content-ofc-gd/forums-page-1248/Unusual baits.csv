50030,huey graphite,2007-03-21 17:03:00,362,"Last year I had in-laws visit from Labrador and they brought pictures with them of some of their local fishing spots. Many great pics of brook trout. They told of one particular day when the bite was so hot they quickly ran out of bait and resorted to gummi bears which worked just as well.  It got me thinking, what is the strangest bait you've caught fish with?  Yes I'm bored and the boat is still in storage.  HG"
50031,Terry,2007-03-21 17:09:00,14456,yup gummi bears work
50033,easton13th,2007-03-21 17:14:00,371,"MMMMM Gummi Bears! I have also used, used chewed gum for pan fish...they seem to like it and it's hard to get off the hook."
50041,The Urban Fisherman,2007-03-21 17:23:00,2050,"when I was kid and used up all my parents worms on the dock we resorted to balogna/ham whatever meat we could steal from the fridge....we also used catapillars but they never really worked to well....  cheers, UF"
50045,pikehunter,2007-03-21 17:29:00,1659,"I was sitting in my boat at the end of Hamilton Harbour, near the entrance to Cootes Paradise   and eating a piece of left over pizza from the night before. I pulled my line in and hooked up a piece of pepperoni. Tossed it in along side the bulrushes and pulled in a really nice catfish about 2 feet long. Never caught anything since on pepperoni though.  Wife said she read about, or saw it on TV that they use Spam."
50046,Joey,2007-03-21 17:29:00,9122,Canned corn kernels.  Worked like a charm  Joey
50049,Jen,2007-03-21 17:35:00,833,"  LOL Joey, I was reading and thinking just that... as they do work like a charm!  Jen"
50056,POLLIWOGG,2007-03-21 17:46:00,835,"Finger.   No I didn't cut it off,  used to just touch the tip of little finger to the water and wait for a perch to grab it and if I was fast enough I could flip it on to the dock before it let go."

50067,007,2007-03-21 18:16:00,537,"When I was back in the UK we used to fish all the time with baits that are probably seen as quite unusual over here ....sweetcorn, luncheon meat/ham, bread, cheese, hemp seed (it 'drugs' the fish) LOL  All of the above (except Hemp) are good for Carp.  Hemp was used as a bait for a fish called a Roach that you don't have here (similar to the invasive Rudd).  In terms of Canada..... someone at Bass Pro said that they have used french fries from McDonalds I think for carp - is this true? Has anyone used them and for what?  007"
50076,mattyk,2007-03-21 18:28:00,2110,"i have caught trout, carp and catfish on gummi worms,watermelon,  and bread."
50077,Headhunter,2007-03-21 18:32:00,5703,"I remember watching Red Fisher, fishing somewhere in the North West Territories, for Pike and using a bra cup on a hook! And they were catching biggins! HH"
50082,troutologist,2007-03-21 18:43:00,951,specks on breakfast sausage and a pike on a lamprey.  Im eager to try gummy worms out this summer for bass too
50090,suds,2007-03-21 18:54:00,70,made popper flies once by running the hook through those disposable ear plugs you roll up and insert in your ears  caught a few smallies..
50117,PatrickGG,2007-03-21 19:52:00,562,Harvey's French fries with some ketchup caught a carp on the grand i was shocked.
50157,Big Cliff,2007-03-21 21:12:00,6899,"A piece of red wool dipped in a bit of cod liver oil and tied directly on to the line (no hook). Fantastic for catfish.... we would put a pail in the boat, drop our line over the side, the catfish would bite and hold on until they touched something solid (the inside of the pail). Caught hundreds of them like that.  This one was from a CO that was a very good friend of mine: Sucker fillet (skin on) cut into strips and frozen. When you want to go lake trout fishing, take enough strips out of the freezer about three days before you want to go. Coat the strips really well with salt and put them in a jar with a lid on it and place it outside in an area where it will get a lot of sun. This toughens up the strips. Use these strips on your jig (he liked using a williams). He claimed that he could consistantly fish lake trout in an area where others were finding the bite slow and he could have his limit while the others where having trouble getting a hit.  whats his name mellows; for rainbows in the fall.  Corn nibblits tied in a roe sack and dipped in a bit of sardine oil for rainbows when I ran out of roe one spring. I caught more than my buddies and they were using roe."
50158,bassmaster4,2007-03-21 21:18:00,801,bread on a trout spinner i caught a turtle some panfish and a largemouth bass 9 inches long lol
50188,Clampet,2007-03-21 22:35:00,1947,Preparation H as a scent. Apparently one of the ingredients is Shark Oil.
50278,irishfield,2007-03-22 00:52:00,26272,""" whats his name Mellows"" LOL Still workin I see...  I grew up in a butcher shop...so while all the other kids fished with worms, I fished with cut offs of Bologna, Mock Chicken, Salami and other slimmy meats.... much to my frustration. Mind you last weeks beef liver was the best for Rideau River cats...bambo rod and 15 feet of string."
50310,GbayGiant,2007-03-22 01:37:00,1780,"My dad said he used cigarette buts and beer caps for rainbows. lol..the good old days, I know the beer caps work."
50320,danc,2007-03-22 01:51:00,4677,"I caught a bunch of Pike once with raw strips of bacon. On one May long weekend, we had quick strike rigs set up with smelts as bait. Caught tons with the smelts but when we ran out, we switched to the bacon. We caught just as many with the bacon, although we were hungry the next morning."
50324,char finder,2007-03-22 02:00:00,12,"Caught a 27 lb lake trout on a metal Shoe-horn on Great Bear lake. I rigged a swiash hook onto a drilled  whole at the bottom of the horn, then attached the swivel at the handle end. Had a nice bend to it and rolled at a nice wide turned at about 1.5 km per hour! good sized bait also at around 6 inches. Still have it for my next trip!!"
50326,Steelcat,2007-03-22 02:05:00,191,"A self made jig with my torned PJ threads as skirt, coke cap as spinner blade~~~ caught a baby bass with it..... it was 10 years ago... too bad I didn't have a camera back then....."
50335,huey graphite,2007-03-22 02:20:00,362,Great responses!  I ued to tease my mom when I was a kid that I was going to make off with some of her earings and use them or lures. I guess that explains the lack of trust.
50346,Rizzo,2007-03-22 02:49:00,4754,"tied a treble to a beer tab, little round berries from a wild bush, plain hook with no bait, all have worked for me"
