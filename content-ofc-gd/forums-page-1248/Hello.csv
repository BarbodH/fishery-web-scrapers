Probaby bump into you a time or two as the weather gets better.  I am the mom, yelling at her kids to cast into the water, not at one another. LOL  Enjoy the OFC family, I certainly do!  Cheers Jen"

50043,slick973,2007-03-21 17:25:00,6,"Wow,  Thank you for all the quick replies and friendly welcomes.  I was thinking about trout fishing in some of the local rivers and streams, but not too sure on which ones are good, or which ones will even have trout in them.  I heard that its trout spawning time pretty soon, so I was looking on getting in the action.  I've been told a place called hidden valley is pretty good, if anyone has heard of it, any info on it would be nice.  Any whoo, I look forward to seeing and hearing from yall again soon.  Take care, and tahnks again.  John"

50079,tonyb,2007-03-21 18:36:00,1637,The burlington shipping canal attracts trout and salmon in the spring.  It's hit or miss based on my experience but it can be good there.  Good luck and welcome to OFC!  Tony
