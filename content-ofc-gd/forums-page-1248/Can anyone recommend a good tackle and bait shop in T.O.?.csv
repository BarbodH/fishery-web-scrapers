I have even been so desperate to go there that on two occasions I have gone there on public transit - not an easy task I can tell you!  From downtown its a subway ride to Downsview then a TTC bus to Rutherford Rd and then a York Region Transit bus to Vaughan Mills OR a GO Train to Rutherford from Union Stn then the York transit bus, but of course coming back you have to do the whole TTC bus/subway thing as there are no GO Trains back!!!       Plus by the time you've paid the excess fare above Steeles and the York region fare (and if my wife comes with me) I might as well have done the whole Zipcar thing.  Of course all that effort is worth it to see the big aquarium (though I've not been lucky enough to see feeding time) and to spend hours looking at fishing gear.  But having said that I would be pleased to be able to go to a local shop closer by for some bait or find some different lures than sold at CT, hence my original post.  I will certainly be checking out some of the suggestions - Al Flaherty's or Fishing on Line sound like they might be a little easier to get to.  Thanks for all the help. 007"

You'll see the sign for Fishing Depot as you go over the 401.  Narrow ailes, but they are all full of great stuff  Maureen"

If you would like to see her smile, just tell her you are spending CASH! The price will drop and the service will go up! As Lew mentioned, Rerries is located on Kingston Road, near West Hill. The dude running the place is very weird, actually follows you around the store as you browse. His product line seems to be mainly old tackle, bought up from other shops that have closed their doors. Factory 2nds can also be found there. Be careful on this point, as there's a reason they are 2nds! His prices are higher on average than other shops, but you can barter with him and as mentioned earlier, the price will drop if you are paying cash! It's actually a decent shop to find rare or no longer available stock. Hope this helps! HH"
