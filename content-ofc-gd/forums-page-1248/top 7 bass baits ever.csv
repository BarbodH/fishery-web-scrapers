50283,OhioFisherman,2007-03-22 00:57:00,6623,"Jed, just for me my first choice is a plastic worm, it can be fished on the top, weightless, as a swimming lure, or various ways on the bottom. Give only one lure to bass fish for the day, that might have to be the one, at least for L/M. Smallies a tube wins.  But that why we are lure collectors, er I mean fishermen, lots of toys to try!"

50372,camillj,2007-03-22 03:38:00,1988,"Havent used em much in a long time .. mostly because I dont really chase bass any more .... but the old Meps, black fury was a guaranteed FAST way to find active fish ... in fact almost always threw one of those to test 'new waters'"

50062,lew,2007-03-21 18:04:00,12767,"I received my new copy of Outdoor Life today and they have listed their choice of the top 7 bass baits ever, in their own opinion.  I had to scan it so it's not really clear but the best I could do.  Everybody will have their own opinion, but what do you think of their choices.  Top of page  Best Upgrade......Terminator T1 spinnerbait  Bottom left...best range, top to bottom of water column when properly weighted F-11 rapala  Bottom right....best action....Yamamoto Original Senko    Top left...Most influential.....Bill Lewis's Rat-L-Trap  Top right...most versatile.....Lunker City Slug-go  Bottom left...Most innovative....Buck Perry Spoonplug  Bottom right....best presentation....Lindy Rig X-Treme  "
50069,young_one,2007-03-21 18:18:00,620,"Havn't try Slug-go and Spoonplug. Maybe...maybe I'll toss them this summer. Where's the topwater stuff? Poppers, buzzbait, and where is the good old texas-plastic-worm."
50075,mattyk,2007-03-21 18:25:00,2110,I love the rapala. One of my favorites. I have caught so many bass and other species on em. I just tried senkos one time last year and i didnt have much luck. I plan on using the more this year.
50078,charlesn,2007-03-21 18:36:00,551,"Interesting.  A ""best bass bait"" article without mentioning a plastic worm or flipping jig is crazy.  The 2 I mentioned have won more money than everything above combined by probably a wide margin.  So from a tournament angler's perspective would replace the spoonplug (trolling is also prohibited in tournaments) and lindy live bait rig with those.  Also, where is the mention of the DROP SHOT.  I've heard it catches a bass here and there.  Charles"
50080,Guest mistyriver1,2007-03-21 18:38:00,0,"Lew, what the heck is a bass ??"
50086,Viscount,2007-03-21 18:50:00,52,"The Rapala is a great choice. Unfair to the other baits that it's been around forever. For Smallies, can't beat a big-o"
50089,Clampet,2007-03-21 18:53:00,1947,"If'n you were to include Live Bait, I would nominate the Crayfish."
50091,trapshooter,2007-03-21 18:55:00,1234,"A pretty good list but where's the tube jig??  My fav way to catch bass is on a crank or spinnerbait though, when they really hammer it."
50114,OhioFisherman,2007-03-21 19:45:00,6623,"Plastic worm still catches fish, jig and pig still catches fish, if your talking bass and those aren`t on your list it means nothing.  Best lure for me the last 15 years or so has to be the TUBE, LOL and like it was mentioned surface lures? Isn`t that what gets you hooked, the surface explosion of a bass trying to kill something!  Lindy rig? a great rig, with a minnow? not for a tournament angler. Some good ones mentioned, Rapala`s still catch fish. Senkos, Rat-L -traps.  Terminator? Not my first choice in spinnerbaits.  LOL my list would be different, then I don`t get paid to make one?"
50125,lookinforwalleye,2007-03-21 20:08:00,4399,Honestly I don`t think much of that list obviously the Rapala it will catch anything that swims and the Senko is IMHO the hottest bass bait right now and it flat out catches fish but what about the good ole Hula Popper and Jitterbug 2 of the best Bass lures ever made and someone mention the Bass jig also the tube jig any serious Bass fisherman has a number of the above mentioned baits in his arsenal. Nothing better for a Bass fisherman than having a big Bass smash a Jitterbug in the dark of night.
50128,setomonkey,2007-03-21 20:14:00,872,"I like to fish for bass but not too much overlap with the Best list.  I like using spinnerbaits, topwaters, plastic worms, Senkos, and flipping jigs. Haven't used tubes much, I keep meaning to use them more.  Mike"
50129,xrap,2007-03-21 20:14:00,683,I'm surprised a flip n jig isn't up there. I use them alot in the summer and they work very well. Black and blue sparkles seems to be the best coulor combo for me.
50130,misfish,2007-03-21 20:14:00,29133,"Charles I believe we know a guy or two that would say the drop shot is #1. LOL  I also would like to know where the tube is. Oh the tube is a real killer.    If you ask my pop,he will tell you the BENO is the number one body bait,and the BUSHWHACKER is second.I keep telling him   ,Pop they are called spinner baits now. HAHAHAHAHA"
50139,charlesn,2007-03-21 20:27:00,551,Just for arguments sake here's my personal top 10 things to use in order of effectiveness for tournament fishing:  1) Tube 2) Flippin' Jig 3) Drop Shot 4) Senko 5) Soft Plastic Texas Rig 6) Topwaters 7) Jerkbaits 8) Prayer 9) Buzzbaits/Spinnerbaits 10) Beer and a crying towel  Charles
50146,misfish,2007-03-21 20:40:00,29133, I concure
50159,OhioFisherman,2007-03-21 21:18:00,6623,LOL coffee and the towel!
50164,Rich Clemens,2007-03-21 21:23:00,3131,"Gimme a pack of rubber worms, 3.0 offset hook, Florida rig, nice heavy weed bed .... I'm good to go.   Had some luck on crank baits and spinner baits.  Mostly though .. they get the ole rubber worm."
50165,Clampet,2007-03-21 21:23:00,1947,If you guys could narrow it down to the ONE BAIT you feel would outshine the rest....what would IT BE?
50175,Weeds,2007-03-21 21:45:00,782,"Thanks for going to all the effort of trying to scan that Lew. Hell, I have no idea of what's best but I'm Listening."
50189,Handlebarz,2007-03-21 22:42:00,3790,"I dont fish bass alot any more but always loved plastic worms texas rig, white or yellow bushwacker AKA spinnerbait with a tail on them usualy split V style, pork rind rigged up on a jig, adn when all else fails just a plain old 1"" yellow twister tail with just a bare hook and one split shot maybe I was way ahead of the drop shot back then cast her out with 4lbs line and crank it in one turn every min or so AAAHHHHH the good ol days of lazy summer fishin."
50238,iMetal,2007-03-22 00:00:00,11,If it was one bait....and one bait only....I'd have to say the jig....might not get you 20 fish that day....but the best 5 for sure!!!!!
50267,irishfield,2007-03-22 00:35:00,26272,"Heck...no mention of the 10"" Mr T LOL  "
50275,kennyman,2007-03-22 00:49:00,737,"I'm not an expert here,but I sure love to fish topwater for bass. My favorite topwaters are 1)BPS Topknocker (this thing makes noise!) 2) Hula Popper 3) Storm Chug Bug. Going to try a bunch of plastics this year and some Northamfishing spinnerbaits (these things are beauty!) too. Does anybody have a favourite for lack of a better word ""fat shad"" type bait for bass?"
50276,Rattletrap2,2007-03-22 00:49:00,1652,"Oh man Lew, just the thought of these baits sets my heart all a flutter!  1) Stick worm (Senko like) rigged wacky style 2) White spinnerbait 3) Texas rigged Tube 4) Pop R topwater 5) Purple worm rigged Texas style  As for flipping jigs, I have no confidence in these yet. Everyone always says how great they are, but I have yet to give them their fair shake. Maybe this will be the year?"
50277,GbayGiant,2007-03-22 00:50:00,1780,"Nice one Wayne.    I've caught some huge smallies on worm harnesses to, anything that spins."
