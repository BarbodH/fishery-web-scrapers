50309,cisco,2007-03-22 01:35:00,597,"Careful folks..... I'd hate a stinkin pencil-pusher at MNR to say ""Hey here's proof noone much uses live bait! So we should outlaw it because no one will get upset."" MNR twists enough of their own surveys so be careful not to add fuel to the fire. Why do a pole? What hypothesis are you trying to test..... perhaps... that folks visiting OFC who are willing to fill out a pole seem to think so-and so? Tremendous bias methinks. No point to it whatsoever unless a hidden agenda exists to try and demonstrate support for a certain position on a matter. My opinion."

50361,Zib,2007-03-22 03:24:00,369,The spread of VHS is inevitable in all our lakes due to ignorant anglers that could care less as long as they save money or are just plain lazy to clean their boat/trailer & gear when they leave an infected lake.  A walleye lake of mine in Michigan has gotten so bad with zebra mussels I havenâ€™t caught a walleye during the day since July 2003. The bass fishing has exploded & so have the weeds with the clearer water.  http://www.freep.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article.../703220395/1058
49399,Garyv,2007-03-20 00:35:00,547,"Rationalize the situation and, be realistic.  There is now a ban in effect for certain areas.  Do you really think that all fishermen that harvest their own minnows are going to abide by it.  Does everyone that has their boat in Erie, Huron etc rinse it throughly before going to Simcoe or other Northern lakes?  Obviously we all would like the answer to be yes to the latter question but know it simply is not done in all cases.  Any law or ban that is passed is meant to try and stop this sort of thing, but only serves to limit overall contamination in other waterways.  They simply are totally infeasible to enforce so you will always have those who do as they wish.  Like most problems with our Great Lakes ecosystem our Governmental agencies drag their feet doing studies and research upon research unit it's to late to do anything.  VHS is a prime example. It's been around for a long time...maybe they thought it would just go away, but like usual now were in deep crap and no one yet has thrown in a life jacket.  As a live bait fisherman I find it disheartening that I cannot fish the way I would like to because someone in Government didn't think VHS was important enough years ago.  It's no different than the Ontario Government allowing the then Ontario Hydro to do as they wished instead of regulating them the way they were suppose to.  We all now pay  the debt reduction charge and not being able to purchase live minnows has it's parallels.   Remember that Chretien's government, instead of going after the ships releasing the exotics, proposed a federal surtax on fishing licenses to help stop foreign invaders.   It's time government started charging and demanding flushing of ballast tanks before entering our system.  How much more destruction to our water ecosystem need take place before someone has the guts to say enough is enough."

49513,Fishmaster,2007-03-20 12:42:00,920,How many people on this site use minnows for bait
49522,pikehunter,2007-03-20 13:02:00,1659," Maybe a pole could be started Steve?  I do use live bait, not every time I go fishing, but about 30% to 50% of the time. There is always a container of worms on hand too, but this is not about squirmy things."
49524,misfish,2007-03-20 13:06:00,29133,"I use them during the ice season when I fish pike. Depending on the clarity of the water,clear, I will use maggots,if it,s stained I will go with small pin heads."
49528,Fishmaster,2007-03-20 13:29:00,920,Good idea Pikehunter ...how do i make a pool on this site is the next ?
