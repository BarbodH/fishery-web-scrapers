49835,SteveK,2007-03-21 00:36:00,2,"Hello All,  I have recently registered and have read a few posts. Looks like a great bunch. I just wanted to give a quick intro being new to the board.  I have been fishing for only a couple of years and learning lots. Primarly fish bass and pike but also fish for rainbows and accassionally go down rigging a few times with a friend. Getting anxious to get out fishing with spring approaching.  Hopefully I will be able to contribute as my experience grows but in the meantime I appreciate information that is being posted.  Steve"
