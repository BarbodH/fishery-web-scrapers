49028,aplumma,2007-03-19 11:28:00,6896,Sure fishin is sexy every time I take the wimmins out and leave them on an island for a night or two they just beg to get back in my boat. Now if I can only remember which island I left Ginger and Mary ann on....    Gilligan
49421,snag,2007-03-20 01:18:00,1932, The single guys in Dial-up land are hoping you receive their PMs they sent today by next week.
49430,camillj,2007-03-20 01:34:00,1988,  And THAT is exactly right !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  Give a man a fish and you feed him for a day ... teach a man to fish and you're free to shop every weekend !
49457,crusty,2007-03-20 02:38:00,83,You be the judge..
49544,ehg,2007-03-20 14:17:00,2666,"Sometimes in cottage country fishermen are busy being the 'provider', women might find that sexy. Otherwise hanging out in a boat with another dude fishing has the appeal of a lawn bowler. I don't wanna see 'Moobs' really!  ehg"
49551,Headhunter,2007-03-20 14:40:00,5703,"I've learned through a buddys' experience that fishing and fisherman are not considered sexy! How do I know this? My friend has been single for atleast the last 6 years. He's tried many methods in order to meet women and begin a relationship. Online dating was a last resort. Under his profile, he indicated that fishing was his passion and included a pic on himself, standing beside his boat. BAD MOVE! After connecting with some women who seemed interested in his profile, he came to learn that many if not all were turned off by the boat and his fishing passion. They felt he would not be the kind of ""partner"" they were looking for as he had obviously too much affection for the sport and his boat! Not what the ""modern day"" woman is looking for, apparently! HH"
49563,LeXXington,2007-03-20 15:14:00,1928,Women who fish are Sexy in my mind..   just like women who drive pickup trucks..  For a reminder http://www.ofncommunity.com/forums/index.php?showtopic=4497  Figure the single women would figure finding single guys is like shooting fish in a barrel...
49569,tonyb,2007-03-20 16:00:00,1637,"Thanks for that link LeXXington, I dunno how I missed THAT!  BTW I didn't see those gals at the Rapala booth on Sunday...Doh!  Tony"
49575,Cookslav,2007-03-20 16:16:00,1457,"Some girls dig the ""Outdoorsy type"" My wife was a sucker for me I know several girls who look for the rugged Outdoorsmen type.  Its Tough not to be an Outdoorsman while being a fisherman... But then again, I know a guy who will fish, but only in a boat, and doesn't camp LOL...."
49609,mdej,2007-03-20 17:03:00,98,"Fishing is sexy... Cept my boat make me look FAT.  Think about it.... Big $$$ boats, cottages trips, fishing trips, nice truck to pull boat, time out in teh sun on the water... Lots of things that girls find sexy."
49638,misfish,2007-03-20 17:43:00,29133,"We  had  a four sisters lot/fishing lizard. Oh ya,nice van she had.She was always commenting on the size of rods we had.LOL"
49677,camillj,2007-03-20 18:56:00,1988, OK .... I cant see a thing .. darn fish is in the way
49681,misfish,2007-03-20 19:04:00,29133,"That gives me a new title for a song................  Save a fish ride a fishermen. Like save a horse ,ride a cowboy."
49789,Guest skeeter99,2007-03-20 22:25:00,0,u are not going to believe this but  I was on a kawartha lake and a 14 foot boat came up with a lady in it and she offered me some love to put it plainly  I thought I was dreaming this but talking to another buddy of mine he mentioned the same thing  found out she was a prostitute from town totally nuts I think
49790,irishfield,2007-03-20 22:32:00,26272,Didn't the OPP pull her over drunk and naked on Lake Joe last year...
49791,keram,2007-03-20 22:37:00,585,"Based on this I would not say that the fishing is not sexy, it looks to me that it is rather "" misanderstood"""
49800,iceguy,2007-03-20 23:07:00,341,"I went to a fishing seminar meeting( not a fishing show)in a fishing club house. There were 40 guys and ZERO women, It was my first time there but a old timer said there was a women there once. The colder the weather the less sexy it is for women."
49911,snag,2007-03-21 03:31:00,1932, Heard you've been getting a lot of requests for GPS coordinates........
50523,fishergirl72,2007-03-22 16:32:00,455,OF COURSE it is sexy!   What do you think attracted me to Fishindevil besides his great charm?!
48607,snag,2007-03-18 03:51:00,1932,"Saw a fellow angler get picked up by a ""hotty"" the other day.  I was perplexed.  I think anglers have the sex appeal of a chess player,curler or professional lawn bowler.  However, I have heard of other such happenings while people are fishing.   Has this happened to you? Have you ""hooked up"" with someone?  Is fishing sexy?"
48608,danc,2007-03-18 03:54:00,4677,Gotta watch out for those boat launch lizards.
48610,irishfield,2007-03-18 04:00:00,26272,I think it can be...  
48619,huey graphite,2007-03-18 04:32:00,362,  She's going to kill you!
48638,taper,2007-03-18 10:01:00,611,"I've heard of lot lizards Dan but how come know one warned me about boat launch lizards.  PS.- where is the absolute worst launch, just to make sure I avoid them."
48640,Clampet,2007-03-18 10:12:00,1947,"Hanlan's Point, I hear."
48641,OhioFisherman,2007-03-18 10:21:00,6623,"LOL Wayne, stay on track, fish pictures!"
48648,Greencoachdog,2007-03-18 11:21:00,8163,"Well...  While impaling a live minnow on a razor sharp hook can make some women recoil in sadistic horror...  and threading a huge gob of chicken livers on a hook can make some hurl their morning SlimFast and Weight Watchers muffin...  or a good whiff of Uncle Charlies Stinkbait can cause some to go into Toxic Shock convulsions.   I have found one fishing scenario most effective in picking up the Hottest of the Hotties,  It is Surf Casting on the beach!  Standing on the beach, holding a 12' rod while wearing nothing but a cutoff pair of blue jeans really draws them in like Green Bottle Flies to fresh dog dung!  They always stop and ask if you've caught anything, and are simply flabbergasted by a cooler of Croaker and Striped Mullet...  then I ask them if they'd like to join me in my room later to view my mounted trophy Whiting!   If for some reason this doesn't work...  I pick out the most attractive one to me that is frolicking in the surf and bounce my 4 oz. disk sinker off her noggin ( they go out like a light when ya tag them just behind the left ear) on a long cast.  I then drop my tackle on a beach towel and rush out to save my unconscious date for the night,  drag her back to shore and administer CPR (a great way to get to first and second base!)  When she regains consciousness, I explain how I witnesses her being knocked out by a murderous jumping Hammer Head Shark (thus the round bruise behind her left ear).  Fought off the beast and delivered her back to the safety of dry land.  They are usually very grateful."
48654,DT10Sam,2007-03-18 12:06:00,480,That is what my problem has been all of these years I have been using an ultralite rod instead of a 12' rod.  Sam
48657,Mike the Pike,2007-03-18 12:16:00,3421,Need a 12 foot rod
48671,Tybo,2007-03-18 13:21:00,1373,"Hey Glen, You should take  your hat off more often. I didn't even notice your STRIPED MULLET!!"
48676,OhioFisherman,2007-03-18 13:34:00,6623,LOL tybo! maybe he meant mallet? in case the 4oz sinker fails?
48688,Dano,2007-03-18 14:16:00,719,"They always stop and ask if you've caught anything, and are simply flabbergasted by a cooler of Croaker and (my) Striped Mullet...  Only in the land of cotton...  Hey Wayne, nice pic man!"

48770,ChrisK,2007-03-18 18:41:00,2772, He must of had muskie slime on him
48773,mason05,2007-03-18 18:46:00,258,Well that proves it. Dude has answered the question in good form. Here's another well documented moment...  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fe1kwXD69BI  Corn Nug
48845,Dano,2007-03-18 21:51:00,719,"Man I hope that girl eats the fish, she could use the nourishment!"
48858,express168,2007-03-18 22:22:00,327,"They see a guy with a nice truck and loading up a nice boat at the ramp and they see that hey this guy has some CASH!   I got them fooled! I am already maxed out paynig for the truck , the boat and fishing gear that she is lucky if I can afford to buy her a coffee. My wife found out the hard way, HA!"
48885,Gerritt,2007-03-18 23:12:00,6129,Wow.... The last thing I think about before a fishing trip is do I look fat in this... because I look fat in everything... Hmmm perhaps that makes me sexy? Last time I thought I was sexy... (yes it was last night and yes I was drunk...) I got kicked in the shins by some unknown chick @ the bar? Why you ask? she and her friends thought it would be a good way to get my attention... well it worked... I looked at her like she had three eyes and walked away.. I think it may have had something to do with the green beer?!?  I have decided people are messed.  Gerritt.
48912,Canuck2fan,2007-03-19 00:25:00,1444,I didn't think fishing was sexy until I saw some of the fine looking women at BPS yesterday that were there by themselves buying stuff. I now regret that I didn't make some inquiries about where they intend to go fishing....
48997,snag,2007-03-19 03:54:00,1932," Are those ""Crustacean Cougars""?  They like Zebra mussel."

49003,Jen,2007-03-19 04:31:00,833,"Of course fishing is sexy!  Think about it a bit,  You get up early, you make coffee, your quiet and considerate, watch the sunrise, watch the sunset, put food on the table, sometimes by flashlight.
