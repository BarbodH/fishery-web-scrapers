(Balsam Lake) I seem to recall someone putting it up last year but can't seem to find it. The ice usually goes out around my Birthday in mid Apr but it would be nice to see it daily to keep tabs. Looking forward to Crappie fishing   but it doesn't open till the last Sat in Apr, still a long way off."
