50047,just2manylures,2007-03-21 17:32:00,144,I have been using these maps for a while now for fun but started noticing a lot of water within an hours drive of my house.  I couldn't believe how many small ponds there were around me.  Does anyone know how you could tell if there are fish in them without actually fishing them?  Also how do you know if you are allowed to fish in them?
50050,The Urban Fisherman,2007-03-21 17:36:00,2050,"just take a drive down - if they're not fenced in, and there aren't any ""no tresspassing, or no fishing"" signs, fish away and let us know how it goes!  I've done just that with some success and some wet lures....  Cheers, UF"
50054,ccmtcanada,2007-03-21 17:44:00,7971," However, if a house was about 100 yards off in the distance and a driveway went right by the pond, I'd be wary....signs or not...."
50057,just2manylures,2007-03-21 17:46:00,144,"That sounds good.  I think I might try contacting the MNR before I do this, just to make sure."
50154,pikehunter,2007-03-21 21:08:00,1659,Does anyone remember a similar thread about these ponds?  It was started maybe last summer?  There was a lot of trouble stirred up because a member wanted people to post the results with pictures and locations when they gave the ponds a try.
50240,Daplumma,2007-03-22 00:02:00,1961,That was a memorable thread..wonder how he made out. Joe
50315,pikehunter,2007-03-22 01:45:00,1659,"I can't remember the outcome Daplumma, but it was interesting reading  I can't even remember who originated it?  Better left as a memory I guess."
50542,Jon,2007-03-22 16:57:00,209,I think this is the page you are referring to.  I assume the recent lack of posts is due to the winter.  Pond Web Page  Jon
50558,pikehunter,2007-03-22 17:34:00,1659,"Yes I do believe that was the one Jon. How to post and access the ""secret"" pond reports. But I see that all the replies to it are deleted. The ongoing controversy must have been too strong."
50588,douG,2007-03-22 18:23:00,2693,"I think that the pond reports are posted, then moved into a pw protected area of the board.  You get a pw by posting a 'secret' report."
