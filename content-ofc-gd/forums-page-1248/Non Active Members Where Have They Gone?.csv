50516,fishergirl72,2007-03-22 16:21:00,455,"Thanks for your concern Mike The Pike and others, we are doing ok and are looking forward to being back full force!"
50222,Mike the Pike,2007-03-21 23:41:00,3421,"Well I am curious  certain active members have not been on the board.  Well we did question Rich. someone said he has found his true love.  Nautifish where has she dissapreared to could she be ticked off at Roy for showing off her singing talent.I miss Tracy's videos. She must be busy with her new business.  Sleded well he must be with Rich  All of a sudden Fishin Devil  and Fishergirl72 have not been with us since March 3,and 4th.My guess is Shawn has got the boat in the water.  what happened to Zack Peter Pan Fish?  Anyway I hope all these people are OK.   Did I forget to mention anyone?  Does anyone know if Big Chev4X4 ok now after had those painful kidney stones.  Just curious .Mike the Pike"
50228,Bernie,2007-03-21 23:46:00,3190,"Ya Mike, wondered about them too. Haven't seen Chris Cross for a while either."
50230,Roy,2007-03-21 23:49:00,13728,"You forgot to mention Canadave. Mike, this place is like home. Some folks leave for a while then return. Nauti has her own board to look after. It's not a terribly bad thing that someone takes a two week break. I think that most folks appreciate your concern but hey.....it's the way it is. Did you notice how many new members we've gotten to meet in the last two weeks?"
50237,Daplumma,2007-03-22 00:00:00,1961,I miss Canadave.I was wondering where Dip Lip went.I have seen that he is still writing and fishing.Just not posting much.I cant believe how many new members have joined of late...thats a good thing. Joe
50239,Bernie,2007-03-22 00:01:00,3190,It didnt seem that long ago that we had our 1000th member join in. Now its almost 1400. Little wonder really. This is a great setup with equally great membership.
50244,Clampet,2007-03-22 00:07:00,1947," See Lip Dip, same member!"
50253,danc,2007-03-22 00:22:00,4677,"People come and go from here. It's been that way for a long time and I suspect it will never change. There's always some positive new members joining that keep me encouraged. It's the process of evolution I suppose. There's a bunch of us that have been here forever. And I doubt that any of us/them will ever leave. It's a good thing, OFC. I don't plan on leaving anytime soon. Home is where the heart is, as the saying goes."
50259,irishfield,2007-03-22 00:28:00,26272,Nobody misses me when I disappear for a month at a time...  ...oh that's right..everyone just breaths a big sigh of relief! LOL
50260,bpsbassman,2007-03-22 00:29:00,941,"Saw Nautifish at the BPS Spring Show.  She's doing fine.  She had taken over the WFN mike and appeared to be auditioning for a new position.  I think you might see her in some WFN cameos.  She said Rich was head over heels in love.  I think that's great, but kind of funny at the same time, given some of his comments here about the other sex. Saw GMan and DWC67 in the store a few weeks ago too.  Sure miss Gavin's reports."
50264,Mike the Pike,2007-03-22 00:32:00,3421, Actually Wayne when you went on your fishing trip up at your cottage I began to say to myself hmmm............no Mr Active Irishfield?Must be building a MOPAR shed.
50270,Clampet,2007-03-22 00:38:00,1947," Unless I'm mistaken, you are the most senior member, meaning the most number of posts on this here board, young fella!"
50273,irishfield,2007-03-22 00:40:00,26272,Well Mike.. I've managed to get a whole 100 hours of work done in the shop...in the last 4 months!!! ...so OFC is gonna take a back burner for the next 6 weeks so I can get what I'm supposed to already have done..done..so I can head North SOON.
50274,irishfield,2007-03-22 00:44:00,26272," Don't remind me Paul..especially considering I was away from a computer for 19+ weeks last season!  I told myself last spring when I was in a similar predicament...that I needed to stay off OFC this winter...and I didn't listen to myself. Will be 12 to 14 hours days in the shop, every day, to make ends meet now... before mid May."
50300,setomonkey,2007-03-22 01:20:00,872," Hmm, I thought that sounded familiar, Wayne.  jk, it's hard to stay away from OFC for long...  Mike"
50336,huey graphite,2007-03-22 02:26:00,362,"  Well said Dan. I have been on since 2001 (I think). You would never guess by my post tally. Can't ever imagine leaving. I think the reason why this topic comes up so often is that because as mentioned so often, it is like a family and when long time members go misssing, we tend to miss their input.  Funny how you can miss people you've never met!"
50340,Rizzo,2007-03-22 02:35:00,4754,"Not that anyone ever misses me, but some of us are ""streaky"" posters.  don't get a chance to visit for a couple of weeks, then make 50 posts in 3 days!"
50344,Joey,2007-03-22 02:47:00,9122,I missed you Rizzo.  I've been wondering how your Barbie sled has been holding up this season too  Joey
50345,irishfield,2007-03-22 02:48:00,26272,Yah...but we know you have to take your business as it comes in Rizzo...
50371,nautifish,2007-03-22 03:37:00,1416,"I am still here Mike have not left, As roy said i have been very busy with my own fishing site,Plus getting a perch tourney organised for members from my site for next month, and also been spending alot of time outdoors fishing when i can.

50374,Rich,2007-03-22 03:50:00,3927,Look forward to a BBR report this weekend
50375,knotaclue,2007-03-22 03:56:00,136,"Sometimes it's better to say nothing,a break can be good now and then."
50396,Mattitude,2007-03-22 08:17:00,155,I was wondering whatever happened to Lucid and the rest of that gang.
50413,bpsbassman,2007-03-22 11:58:00,941,Rich!!!!!!! You're alive Did your new love give you permission to post?? Hope all is going well.
50462,TJQ,2007-03-22 14:33:00,7806,LOL... outta the woodwork they come!!!  How come no one misses me... lol
