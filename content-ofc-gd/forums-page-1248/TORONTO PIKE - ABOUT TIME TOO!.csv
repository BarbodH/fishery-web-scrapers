50332,mepps,2007-03-22 02:15:00,1301,well done!!!!
50365,SHAD,2007-03-22 03:28:00,134,"Nice fish, leslie split or ontario place?"
50380,cisco,2007-03-22 04:22:00,597,A real beauty! Congrats! I'd give er 41 or 42 inches and she's ready to lay eggs she's so fat! All depends though on how big you are..... if 5ft nothing vs 6ft the pike size may vary a coupla inches. JK! Great fish!!!!!!!!!!!!!
50381,snag,2007-03-22 04:23:00,1932," Truth be told,  I was there 20 min. and that was the last cast........."
50382,snag,2007-03-22 04:25:00,1932," I bet they are there, but heck, you may catch a monster walleye by accident..........."
50417,ccmtcanada,2007-03-22 12:07:00,7971," But Walleye are out of season....I would hope I didnt catch one!!   We release everything we catch anyways.  We'll get out there again soon I hope.  Great pike there Snag...beats my PB in weight by over 50%....  LOL.  We find that when the Pike are in, the Walleye are not...so not too much risk in accidental catch there."
50428,valerie,2007-03-22 12:58:00,83,Great fish snog . Can't wait to get my first pike sounds like alot of fun.

50466,snag,2007-03-22 14:38:00,1932," The routine is:  Fish on, Camera out. Remove hook Take pic Release.  Repeat   Luckily, there was a mooring post with a flat top to put the camera on."
50467,valerie,2007-03-22 14:39:00,83,Hey snog you have a PM.
50468,snag,2007-03-22 14:41:00,1932," Thought you ate the last 4 you caught. My mistake, you sold them in Kensington Market.  Dang memory!"
50471,snag,2007-03-22 14:47:00,1932," I know. I saw it.  You have to follow the etiquette here.  Introduce yourself to the board.  and don't ever ask me where I fish. I don't respond to PMs like that and people here do find it offensive.  Toronto is small, explore. Eventually we'll meet.  Welcome aboard"
50483,valerie,2007-03-22 15:20:00,83,I didnt mean to affend you sorry about that . I wouldn't ask for your favorite spots in general just some advice . Thanks
50484,snag,2007-03-22 15:25:00,1932," No probs,  Try the islands.  Hope your brother has a great birthday!!"

50518,ehg,2007-03-22 16:23:00,2666," All the channels were iced over at the islands as of March 21st (yesterday). One islander i spoke to yesterday said there is still up to 8 inches of ice in main channels. Could be gone by this weekend however!  Remember pike season closes as of end of March 31 st. till May 5th.  cheers,  ehg"

50552,easton13th,2007-03-22 17:09:00,371,Great pics makes me jealous..can't wait to get out there. Way to go !
50556,The Urban Fisherman,2007-03-22 17:18:00,2050,"Dude, Pike fear you as Steelie's fear CC!  Thanks for the report!  ps. whats with the name....snog?  Cheers, Urbano"
50597,snag,2007-03-22 18:43:00,1932," Good question.  Answer:  Good Grammar,  Snog is the proper British pronounciation of ""Snag""  Snogging is a preferred British pastime."
50191,snag,2007-03-21 22:44:00,1932,"I'll be brief.  The weather was crap this afternoon. As I drove, I was thinking: ""why bother""?   Here is a sad, desolate bouy. Bobbing in a bay of murky despair.   Just for fun and size comparison. Here is a wee snotty I caught Ice fishing. (You'll notice my Dead bait of choice is a white storm lure. It out performs live bait)   Soooooooooo, I'm at my spot; it's raining, it's cold. There's nobody around. Why am I here? I'm using a lure I got out of one of the cheap bins at the sportsman show but I'm sure it has to work. I'm slowly reeling in, the water is like mud........and then I think I see a FOLLOW! Indeed! It's huge!!  Here is the Mama(?) swimming.  Thank goodness for my drag. She did a bunch of runs with some good solid weight. She followed and swallowed (easy boys). My heart sank thinking that some dire surgery was to follow. Turns out she hadn't bitten the lure. Instead, she had clamped down on my leader (the blood in the next photo is from my finger and a bit from her lip) When I got her mouth open with the spreaders, the lure was hanging free in her vacuous pie-hole. No pliers needed!!!  So this is the scoop. I was alone as usual so I did not measure her, I'm guessing over 40"". However, I did weigh her with my digital scale, 16.5 lbs!!!!! I look like an ogre because the weight on my messed-up finger was discomforting.  Here she is   IT HAS BEGUN.............  SNOG"
50194,silveradosheriff,2007-03-21 22:48:00,1025,Very nice!!!
50196,Golfisher,2007-03-21 22:51:00,586,Very nice indeed!

50199,glirw,2007-03-21 22:59:00,200,One heck of an ogre you are snag ! Way to set the standard !  I know that buoy ...........
50200,Clampet,2007-03-21 23:00:00,1947,"You Da man, The Big Smoke Man.."
50202,tbayboy,2007-03-21 23:01:00,1497,"What a beauty Snog and a great job on the story telling too.  My god I'm dying to wet a line now, time to check the weekend weather forecast."

50207,urbanangler1990,2007-03-21 23:10:00,933, something called a self timer Roy    nah im just geussing
50211,Bly,2007-03-21 23:17:00,1556,"  WooHoo!!  Very very nice!  You went for it and what a beauty pay off!!  I had the same ""why bother"" attitude today and I am ashamed to admit....I fell for it. Stayed home,packed away the ice gear and reorganized the soft water stuff.....should have went fishing   :wallbash:  bly"
50215,ccmtcanada,2007-03-21 23:25:00,7971,"Nice job!!!  It's great to see your TO pike posts again...I missed them!!!!  Maybe if the pike are back in the shallows there, they are back in my neck of the woods.  I'll have to get out soon though!!!  Great work Snag...and yes, I cant bring myself to call you Snog yet...LOL"
50220,ehg,2007-03-21 23:32:00,2666,"Tried around the foot of spadina for about half an hour after work and nearly froze in the wind and rain, so packed it in quickly.  Obviously your perseverance paid off.  WTG,  ehg"
50225,TennesseeGuy,2007-03-21 23:44:00,957,Nice job.  You're off to a good start.

50286,Steelcat,2007-03-22 01:01:00,191,omg you are making all of us so want to get out there tomorrow and have some fishing fun~!!! Nice fish btw~!
50311,Joey,2007-03-22 01:38:00,9122,Right on Snag.  That's a beauty fish.  How hard was your heart pounding?  Great report.  Joey
50321,fishinfool,2007-03-22 01:52:00,366,"You had to go and start it eh, now I have to go and get me some. Awesome fish snog, WTG! Did he swim away strong?"
50329,007,2007-03-22 02:10:00,537,"Good job snag man!  The Master Pike fisherman is back.  Great looking fish.  They do tend to like getting revenge on your fingers though  So tell me, is your camera set up on a tripod for these great self portraits?  If so is it set up ready before you even catch the fish or do you have to scramble around once the fish is landed?  Always wondered... they seem such well composed shots, and would like to give the self portrait with fish shot a go one day, even if the pike I catch are 1/5th the size  Thanks for sharing.  Itching to get out there.  007"
