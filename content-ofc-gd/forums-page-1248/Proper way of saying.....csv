49687,just2manylures,2007-03-20 19:21:00,144,"Well after several hours of debate over the phone with my old pal spiltshot, we couldn't come up with an answer.  I figured the best place to turn was to the might OFNCers.  The question at hand is (insert drumroll) how do you pronouce RAPALA?  I say it is Rap-a-la.  Splitshot thought it was Ra-pal-a.  Then I mentioned that I had heard a fellow at the Sportsman's Show call it Ra-pel-a.  I need some help to settle this friendly bet, there is no money on the line of course."
49689,Hookset,2007-03-20 19:26:00,367,"c - r - a - n - k - b - a - i - t ...........  just kidding, I say it like Ra - pal - a.  But then I had to go to summer school for english way back when."

49708,ecmilley,2007-03-20 19:44:00,2163,"actually the offcial thread of spring is ""tiller vs console"" which was a couple days ago. i never say rapala just buy them, when asked what i am using the answer is usually x-rap, shap rap ect."
49713,ccmtcanada,2007-03-20 19:54:00,7971," Now that I think of it, I'm the same way...never say Rapala....I'll say shad rap too."
49724,tonyb,2007-03-20 20:16:00,1637,"as Rick said, proper way is RAP-ala, not ra-pal-a like most people say it."
49727,Weeds,2007-03-20 20:20:00,782,Rap-la. Makes you sound lazy and  indifferent.
49735,douG,2007-03-20 20:37:00,2693,"Now I say Rap' a la, 'cause I find it gives me an air of insouciance and elan which has always eluded me."
49748,Garyv,2007-03-20 21:14:00,547, I'm confused...indifference to enthusiastic vigor and liveliness...I say RA PALA  just like RI COLA

49776,Joey,2007-03-20 21:55:00,9122,"I say Ra pa la, and have a Rapala shirt that I wear fishing, and people always mis-pronounce it (or pronounce it the way they think is right).  Then the usual discussion ensues about how its supposed to be pronounced.  Ahhhh, I miss Summer and those dang arguments about my shirt  Joey"
49778,keram,2007-03-20 21:58:00,585,Just RAP

49796,Roy,2007-03-20 23:02:00,13728,"I've called them ""Ra-PAL-as"" for 40 years. A few people have corrected me lately. Ask me if I care. I still fish wit minnas n' woims. It'll be spring tonight....that might help a little."

49922,pikehunter,2007-03-21 08:51:00,1659,"Ra pala.  So how do you pronounce Nissan? Nea san or Ni ssan with a soft ""I""? But then I go back a long way and still prefer to call them Datsun.  OMG! It's 4:50 AM and I'm debating a rediculous topic...wish I could sleep."
49960,just2manylures,2007-03-21 12:21:00,144,Thanks for all the help guys.  Even though a few of you don't see a purpose to this thread you have settled a debate that has been going on between me and splitshot for a while now.
50013,Tybo,2007-03-21 16:34:00,1373,"Got to love it when the English language destroys a perfectly good name.  Rapala Hyundai Porsche Loeb Jesus And even my own last name, Tyborski. Or to some people around here, Whats his name.  These are not English names. So to pronounce them properly you have to say them in there native tongue.  Ra pal a Hy und ai Por scha Lobe Hey sus"
50015,ccmtcanada,2007-03-21 16:37:00,7971," Hey...before the softwater hits, it's amazing at what threads get a huge amount of attention on here....LOL.  If you had asked this question in May, you may not have got your answer....haha."
