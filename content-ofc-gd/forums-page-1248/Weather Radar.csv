50241,Bernie,2007-03-22 00:02:00,3190,It shows the time of the last update on the screen. I think its updated every 10 minutes.

50317,Bernie,2007-03-22 01:48:00,3190,If you watch it from time to time you can calculate how soon the storm will arrive and how strong it may be. Last year I seen an intense front coming in and we managed to get some equipment put away in time to prevent damage. That particular storm took down quite a few trees and did some other damage in our area.
50328,GbayGiant,2007-03-22 02:09:00,1780,"Exactly Nip, but I'll be watching for the storm coming in and that's when I'll be racing to get out onto the water.   Had the best days just before a storm, it's magic how the fish go crazy, but not recommended for those concerned about their safety."
