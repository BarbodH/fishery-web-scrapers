MNR office at Bay and Wellesley ... look up the area you want on a microfiche (remember them????) and get the map you want right there and then ... for about $5 or $10 they had 50,000 1 of the whole province ... a little dated but the topography probably hasnt changed much  anyhow might try giving them a call to see if thats still doable .... I got most of my favourite lakes that way.  Now of course I just use the cd's that came with Mapcreate and make my own"
50479,grt1,2007-03-22 15:01:00,638,I just called the company that makes the maps for the Red Lake area. They produce a map of Birch Lake that has the depths on it. They can be reached at   [emailÂ protected]  He said to send him an email and they can get you a map by mail.
