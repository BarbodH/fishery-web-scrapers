49445,kelvarnson,2007-03-20 02:11:00,15,Just booked a cottage there for the July long weekend.  Quick Interweb search tells me bass and pike in abundance.  Anyone been there before?
49572,iceguy,2007-03-20 16:08:00,341,"I was there once, fished an afternoon caught some small and largemouth bass, I don't think there are any pike in there. (I know pike are usually everwhere).There was rainbow stocking a while back but doubt there are any left. Check out the backroad's mapbook it will tell you what's in that lake for sure."
49608,Guest lundboy,2007-03-20 17:02:00,0,I have fished Kapakog which empties into Healey (or vice versa).  Kapakog does have pike seems to be mostly about 4lbs in size.  Lots of Bass.  Healey should not be that different.
