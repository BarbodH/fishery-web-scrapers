50388,Marc Thorpe,2007-03-22 04:55:00,621,I'd like to know what folks think are the elements needed to produce a special individual?  Why would you classify a particular body of water to potentially produce a unique individual?  What Forage species do you muskies eat the most?
50391,GbayGiant,2007-03-22 05:18:00,1780,"Even though education of the species your fishing is great and can only improve your odds  I think luck has a lot to do with it to.  I like water bodies that have low fishing pressure or none at all would be nice   the size of the water body I think would up the odds of a unique fish, the amount of bait fish or forage, a body of water with numerous and large spawning areas that the species require to reproduce, a body of water where the limit to consume is low or 100% release would be even better.  Good question Marc, I think all these new diseases need to be contained or somehow controlled as well or it could destroy a body of water in no time."

I don`t know how particular a muskie would be, top of the food chain, everything else is food. I do think they would rather chase 1- 3 pound walleye than a hundred Emerald shiners. Food supply and food size during the entire life cycle gives them an advantage.  LOL look at people today less hunter - gatherers fatter people. More time eating less time tracking down food."
