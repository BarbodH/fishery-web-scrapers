The members guided each student through the whole process .... materials and equipment were all supplied by the club. Fishing stories were shared and trips planned on soft water were dreamed about. The flies made looked great.... next comes the big test.... will a fish think so. Catching a fish feels great, it's even better when you catch it on something you made. Next week the kids will get casting lessons in the gym! Thanks to the club members who made it a memorable night for those who attended, Cheese"
