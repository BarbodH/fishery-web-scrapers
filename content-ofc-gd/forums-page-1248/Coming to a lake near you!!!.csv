49620,iceguy,2007-03-20 17:13:00,341,"I Really hope they do something about these things, Except for eating them, there are dangerous fish and should be #1 targert  invasive species, I'm suprise that it didn't say the comerants won't even eat them."
49642,tonyb,2007-03-20 17:56:00,1637,The sportfishing focus will shift from salmon to carp  Tony
49660,iceguy,2007-03-20 18:23:00,341,"Catching carp out of air with a net doesn't sound as fun as bringing in a 30lb salmon with a rod. I could get into batting some carp in mid air with a bat though,"
49669,easton13th,2007-03-20 18:34:00,371,I have watched a program on how fast these are spreading... Does anybody know if the Canadian Gov't or MNR is doing anyhing to be proactive to this situation. OR is it too late for our in land waters?
49696,kemper,2007-03-20 19:34:00,2232,"There are efforts in place to try and stop them, but the reality is there isnt much we can do to keep them out of the great lakes."
49706,Fishmaster,2007-03-20 19:41:00,920,Lets hope Kings eat them before they get big ....our club will be stocking 540000 kings in the next month or so ..the US boys will be stocking 1.5 million kings to follow ..i also heard 100000 Alantic's will be stocked in the next week or 2 also..

49716,Fishmaster,2007-03-20 19:56:00,920,It would be sweet if we could blast them Cormarants and Carp while trolling for Kings and Walleye
49719,Crazyhook,2007-03-20 19:59:00,1154,on a good note is will make my shares in Green Giant sky rocket
49730,Fishnfiend,2007-03-20 20:24:00,357,Can you say bowfishing?

49875,BillyBarilko,2007-03-21 01:53:00,28,  wow.  All that's stopping these things is an electric barrier in the Chicago canal that connects the Mississippi with the Great Lakes...   At 2:50 in the video its apparent how bad it can get with these things...
49882,Fishmaster,2007-03-21 02:18:00,920,Wow thats not good ...if its that bad why not net them ..set net across the dam river i would think trying  to get them outa the water would be better then watching them and hopen they dont get in the great lake ...but im sure like everything else there here allready ..
49886,FishFinder,2007-03-21 02:24:00,481,why not a fine mesh net if the electrical thing fails?
49951,ccmtcanada,2007-03-21 12:04:00,7971,"Scary scary clips there from youtube.  I have no faith that our gov't will do anything effective.  Sure, they've made it illegal to possess live Asian Carp, but that came about after ppl were releasing them as good luck.  If they've been doing that, then they are already here...just have to wait for the population explosion."
49957,Sinker,2007-03-21 12:18:00,8692,"I've seen how well those electric barriers work........  ..........they may slow them down, but stop them.......far from it!!!  I think its already too late. They're gonna be here before anything gets done about them.  Sinker"
50366,BillyBarilko,2007-03-22 03:29:00,28,"Here's where genetic engineering can help... Provided they don't mess it up...  Engineer their genes so that the carp only grow to be < 2 lbs max in size.   Put these engineered carps in the missisip now and have them interbreed.  They will remain lower on the food chain and won't reproduce in the #'s they are at.  I know GE has risks, but at this point some fisheries are already gone what's there to loose in those waters?  Its not like this is anything new, eg: MNR/DNR and the Splake program.   The problem is you have these fish that come in and swamp the who ecosystem and grow to such a size that no predator can take them out... limit their size and at least we have a chance...."
