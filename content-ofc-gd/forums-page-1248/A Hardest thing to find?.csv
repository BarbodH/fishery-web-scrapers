49480,ehg,2007-03-20 04:13:00,2666,"After about 4 months of searching craigslist, Kijijii. Star classifieds, etc... i still can't come up with a used 12ft. alum V-hull boat. Looking to cartop since living in downtown T.O leaves no room for trailer. Seems like many others are posting wanting the same thing.  Anyways, contemplating just getting a new 12fter, so i'm curious if anyone knows of a boat place that has a selection of smaller fishing boats (even used boats) within an hour of GTA.  Thanks in advance,  ehg"
49494,Fisherman,2007-03-20 10:31:00,7201,"Well, then you shouldf be looking at the Supershopper.com, a much better resource. It's still a couple weeks early, but here's a couple: http://www.buysell.com/root/search/42/603/...eous_Boats.aspx"
49500,JEREMY,2007-03-20 11:46:00,300,Buy and sell is a good place to look we print the mag where i work so i always look also bass pro has some jon boats.Good luck with your search.
49514,pikehunter,2007-03-20 12:42:00,1659,"Did you check the OFC classified? I saw a nice folding 12' boat there that might fill your needs perfectly. Easy to store and transport, worth considering, right Irishfield?  Or you can buy a new 12' reasonable at Riverside Marina, Dunnville.  OK, maybe I should edit this reply. I just checked the classified and didn't see Wayne's boat advertised. Was I dreaming that his boat is for sale or perhaps he posted it in the forum? The search continues..."
49525,mepps,2007-03-20 13:21:00,1301,Make a drive north to any town near a lake an hour or two from Toronto.  Towns like Belleville always havev several small boats for sale.
49527,The Urban Fisherman,2007-03-20 13:27:00,2050,"Hey Dude - I live in the GTA also and I'm thinking of going with the 10' Jon Boat from Bass Pro.  They're only $641.00 and with a bit of work you can add a casting deck etc. etc.  Check out this like of Jon Boat Mods:  http://www.myjonboat.com/hall-of-fame.htm  Cheers, UF"
49536,pikehunter,2007-03-20 13:58:00,1659," Just make sure that you are within the boat's weight load capacity. A small 10 or 12' boat cannot carry much weight!  Here are the specs for the 10' Bass Pro Jon Boat  Length  	10' Beam 	45"" Transom Height 	15"" Bottom Width 	32"" Max. Recommended HP 	3 HP Max. Person Capacity 	2 Persons Max. Person Weight 	314 Lbs. Max. Weight Capacity 	354 Lbs. Hull Material 	0.043 5052 Marine Alloy Weight (approx.) 	80 Lbs."
49540,ehg,2007-03-20 14:07:00,2666,"Thanks for the replies so far folks! I was unaware of Supershopper looks like a good link Fisherman.  Looking for a 12ft. V-hull not a jon boat however, since i'll try larger waters occasionally.  This helps quicken my search already. Time is of the essence, what with kids, job, and all.  Thanks again,  ehg"
49562,grt1,2007-03-20 15:13:00,638,you got to be careful in a Jon boat. We used to duck hunt in a 14 foot Jon boat and it was very tippy. I really can't imagine one with a casting deck being very stable.
49587,The Urban Fisherman,2007-03-20 16:34:00,2050," Good point!  It's great for me cause I only weight 135lbs and it's really only going to be my beagle and I fishing!  Cheers, UF"
50190,ehg,2007-03-21 22:44:00,2666,"Just a thanks to folks for PM's, links and advice. Ended up finding the exact boat i was looking for thanks to this post. Will be picking up the boat on Saturday.  cheers,  ehg"
50203,pikehunter,2007-03-21 23:03:00,1659, I hope you don't think I feel sorry for you!!!  I need to loose 135 pounds!!!!
50205,Clampet,2007-03-21 23:04:00,1947,"Funny (?) thing is, I inherited a 12"" Aluminum with a 5 HP motor, and had no use fer it as I considered that thing too small to visit the BOQ, where I like to fish. I considered that a "" Floating bathtub"", not suitable fer anything but Duck hunting in a pond which I have given up years ago. I wound up donating it to one of my Nieces, and she has since given it to her son, my great nephew."
50231,ehg,2007-03-21 23:52:00,2666,"Well thats unfortunate now your stuck on shore PP.  Had larger boats i trailered but have better accessibilty to some waters, without waiting at the launch, with a cartopper. Still can fish larger waters like Lake O or Quinte, just with caution.  cheers,  ehg"
50293,Clampet,2007-03-22 01:08:00,1947," I'd rather be stuck on shore than swimming fer shore. And never mind the PP, that was fer the old board. Clampet "
50306,fishinfool,2007-03-22 01:32:00,366,"I guess this means that I won't have to bail or drive the boat next time we get out eh. LOL Congrats on the new boat, you were due.  Stan"
50313,pikehunter,2007-03-22 01:40:00,1659,"Glad to learn that you found your ideal boat. Be careful out there. Any boat can be a danger in rough water, a 12' can be really dangerous. Keep looking over your shoulder for whatever may be coming at you and don't push your luck too far. Stay off the larger waters and always plan an escape back to port. I have had some scary situations, some very close to the launch. Even 1 - 2' waves or a wake can cause concern when in a small boat.  I wish you many happy hours of fishing."
