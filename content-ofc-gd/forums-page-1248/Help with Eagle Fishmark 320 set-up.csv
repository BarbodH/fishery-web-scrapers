50029,bbog,2007-03-21 17:00:00,665,"Hi folks,  Received an Eagle Fishmark 320 sonar from my son last year and was looking for suggestions on how to configure it. I fish out of a canoe and typically in small shallow lakes 35' or so deep. On occasion I have put on the portable downriggers and trolled deep for Lake Trout - but this is not my main use. So far I have been using it mostly to confirm depth.  I'm sure with the appropriate set-up the sonar can offer a lot more to the fishing experience. Looking forward to gaining some of your expertise.  Thanks, Barn"

50051,bbog,2007-03-21 17:37:00,665,fantastic - thanks just2manylures.
50104,just2manylures,2007-03-21 19:24:00,144,Here it is 1-800-661-3983.  I don't know his extension number.  He helped me with my fisheasy and set it up properly like the pros do.  I tried it on the ice this past february and it picked up my jig and I could see fish all over the bottom.

50349,camillj,2007-03-22 02:54:00,1988,Not sure if you already got one .. but get a portable transducer mount ... mine was about $35 at BPS ... it works like a charm for things like canoes ... just clamp it onto the gunwhale and you're good to go.  
50557,bbog,2007-03-22 17:18:00,665,Hey camillj that's a pretty cool looking transducer mount. I using the portable kit with the suction cup. Made a small modification to ensure the transducer is pointed in the correct direction. After my last stop at BPS I don't have any room in my small car for any other stuff. Might need to get a bigger car - this fun past time could get expensive!!
