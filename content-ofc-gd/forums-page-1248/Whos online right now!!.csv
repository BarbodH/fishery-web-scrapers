As in to me I usually see two basic types of anglers. The ones who ""accept"" what is happening on a slow day and just relax and take the skunk. Then there are the types who fish harder when the going gets slow. So what tricks as an ""extreme"" angler does he pull out when nothing is biting to get fish."
