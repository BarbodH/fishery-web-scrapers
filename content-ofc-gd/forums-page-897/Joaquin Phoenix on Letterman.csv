305544,dobee,2009-02-12 21:47:00,301,i think hes acting it up.. just a promo... check the end... he pretty much jumps out of character and starts yapping w/ letterman.
305545,tinbanger,2009-02-12 21:49:00,1028,Thanks for that  Letterman is a master !  TB
305550,muskeybugged,2009-02-12 21:51:00,282,"yeah he had me going for a while, maybe it was my own use! ...... He is an actor!"
305552,diggyj,2009-02-12 21:54:00,548,"I think it's pretty close as to what people are thinking, I'd say 50/50....from talking with people today.  Letterman has some classic lines......"
305556,tinbanger,2009-02-12 21:59:00,1028,"""Apologies to Farrah Fawcet"" LMAO!"
305557,Grimace,2009-02-12 22:07:00,2020,That was funny.    I think he was having everybody on.     He was trying not to laugh a few times.     He said maniacal way to clearly when teasing Paul Schaffer.      Sounds kinda like a Kaufman gig to me.  Got their website a bunch of hits though and they are getting pretty good face on the news.  Pretty good stuff.
305559,misfish,2009-02-12 22:08:00,29133,"This guy is one of the best I have seen in a long tme. I hated this guy in the movie Glatiator. But after he did,Walk the line,that was SO COOL.  A real ACTOR."
305564,Roy,2009-02-12 22:19:00,13728, Hey! That describes 50% of the members here including you and me!
305565,Terry,2009-02-12 22:21:00,14456,"yeah I don't know if it was an act or not if it was an act, he needs to be given the oscar"
305567,tinbanger,2009-02-12 22:22:00,1028,he just looks like he didn't want to be there .
305579,Bernie,2009-02-12 22:43:00,3190,It's a sad commentary really. Have seen several people from my past including a couple good friends get messed up and they are only a portion of their former selves. Another thing is that many of them were exceptionally talented. Hopefully it was an act on his part. It would be a shame to have a talent such as his ruined.
305586,Grimace,2009-02-12 22:52:00,2020,"When Letterman asked him what type of music he was doing and he said Hip Hop I was almost crying I was laughing so hard.  It seemed too well set up not to be a joke.  I hope he wasn't all high and stuff.   It would be pretty sad if it was the truth.  But again I am suspicious, it was all too well set up and he said ""maniacal laughter"" perfectly."
305802,Maverick,2009-02-13 03:58:00,371,"If that was serious we'll be reading about him in the obituaries pretty soon.  oh and that link has been removed now, this one is up though;  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1IncP6xjfg"
305867,Mattitude,2009-02-13 08:50:00,155,"Apparently his appearance etc is an act.  It is part of a mockumentary being filmed by Casey Affleck, Ben Afflecks younger brother.  http://celebedge.ca/Dramarama/ContentPosti...'''"
