306055,JFR,2009-02-13 19:56:00,498,"Just back from Innisfil beach and checking the ice conditions for tomorrows Fishing for Tyler  Ice has firm up after the mild spell, ruts left in the slush out from  the ramp has firmed up, and may be a slight problem for snow vehicles little or NO snow cover on the ice, so it might be a bit slippery for the walkers. I did notice a few trucks and vans on the ice, a lot of huts further out  Cold temps overnight, clear evening sky, should set up well for tomorrow morning.  See you in the AM.  John"
