305508,misfish,2009-02-12 20:55:00,29133,           Now this one I cant figure out.LOL  
305512,lunkerbasshunter,2009-02-12 21:03:00,2585,didnt a bunch go through the ice a copy years ago on simcoe???
305520,brkygetr,2009-02-12 21:16:00,425,Yeah whats the deal with that last pic???? Somethin fishy there
305523,Big Cliff,2009-02-12 21:16:00,6899,There are going to be some very unhappy people when they return to their trucks!  Where were these pictures taken?  PS. There is so much water on top of the ice that I have waves on the lake in front of my place right now!
305525,tinbanger,2009-02-12 21:18:00,1028,"saved that last one as my screen saver LOL  It seems every few years there is an incident at Gilford . One or two vehicles park on the ice , then before you know it it looks like Walmart on Boxing day !  Usually the ice just 'bends' and the vehicles are door handle deep .  TB"
305526,misfish,2009-02-12 21:21:00,29133,"Pics were sent to me by my aunt.She says it,s the lake Erie area."
305534,Tarzan's Jane,2009-02-12 21:35:00,1183,"I received those pics too at work a week or so ago with a few others...apparently they came from Russia is what was indicated...again, who knows."
305535,Jet,2009-02-12 21:36:00,364,I'm pretty sure it's somewhere in Europe or Russia area. I got the email too and the vehicles and plates are not from North America.  Here's another pic from that email. Now that's busy! 
305536,diggyj,2009-02-12 21:37:00,548,"Im sure in that last shot all those vehicles were parked in a designated area, somewhere near the shoreline and then like dominoes then all went down, or in this instance in....."
305537,osmondrs,2009-02-12 21:38:00,61,"If the owners of the cars in the last picture were to read the small print on their parking receipts, I bet it says something to this effect:  ""Parking lot operator or attendants are not responsible for the safety/visibility of your vehicle at the time of your return this evening.  All responsibility for the vehicles and any items left in the vehicle lies solely with the owner - and the ice gods!"" (I will resist the temptation of adding an ""lol"" to this text in sympathy with the owners)"
305540,diggyj,2009-02-12 21:41:00,548, I'll add it for ya Osmond......LOL
305541,tjsa,2009-02-12 21:45:00,1578,"Its in Russia, you can see ""webpark.ru"" in all but the last picture. I went to http://www.webpark.ru  Still surfing the site, although I cannot read Russian."
305542,misfish,2009-02-12 21:46:00,29133," Well Im going to have to ask her again. Can you say MUD ON MY FACE. Never trust a women,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Well some.LOL"
305548,osmondrs,2009-02-12 21:50:00,61,"Wherever they're from, they're awesome (including the 'ice-fishing flea market' added later by Jet)."
305558,drwxr,2009-02-12 22:07:00,453,"the plates are russian, so yes they came from russia  ill adda couple as well if you dont mind misfish        "
305560,Grimace,2009-02-12 22:08:00,2020,I like the rig that is pulling the truck out.
305566,drwxr,2009-02-12 22:21:00,453,its called UAZ 469
305570,Grimace,2009-02-12 22:33:00,2020,  Thanks.    just did some googling.   Pretty reliable rig from what they say.
305577,misfish,2009-02-12 22:41:00,29133,"I misread the email  ""those guys on Erie last week, have nothing on these guys""  Sorry for the misread."
305620,Tarzan's Jane,2009-02-12 23:26:00,1183,"  ok...now say sorry for saying ""never trust a woman"" ....come on, say it.  lol"

305699,irishfield,2009-02-13 01:17:00,26272,"I thought that was a bunch of women that were told to ""park along the shoreline"" !"
305849,CLofchik,2009-02-13 05:25:00,854,"Does anybody have the pic of Simcoe from a few years ago.  Not sure the location, but the ""parking lot"" where the guy just HAD to try out his shiny new gas auger before hiking out to his spot and ended up flooding the whole area?"
