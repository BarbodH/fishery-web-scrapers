305593,mbac31,2009-02-12 22:55:00,904,I have bought 4 of these rods to test. I have casted them in lake Ontario a couple of times but have not fished them good yet. I will be testing them soon. I really liked the look and the weight of them. I think that they will be a big seller.

305603,uglyfish,2009-02-12 23:12:00,981,"i have met a couple of the rapala prostaff, and one i fished with in a couple tourneys, and he is actually VERY high on these rods, infact all of rapalas new rods and reels have him excited. in fact i was just informed by a mutual friend that he is selling all his other gear and goin with rapala exclusively. and i mean selling top end quantum, shimano and st. croix rods and reels. thats gotta say somethin."
305728,EC1,2009-02-13 02:11:00,930,"had it not been a 1 piece rod, I would be all over them by now. Im liking the design, and the weight probably is really good. Only thing is, does anyone know the weights to the new Quantum superlight or something rods with the MSRP of like $2xx?"
305740,Jigger,2009-02-13 02:26:00,1237,Broke two last year. Hope they've worked the kinks out by now. Very sensitive and lightweight.
