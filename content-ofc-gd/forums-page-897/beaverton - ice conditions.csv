305445,tinbanger,2009-02-12 18:14:00,1028,"With the melting snow , and high winds predicted I thought it would be worth a trip to beaverton to anchor our hut .  Pulled in at the town docks to see the Beaver river flooding its banks , not surprisng with the massive snow melt and high amount of rain fall     Excavator working to ease the pressure .    Doesn't get much more 'Live' than this !   Walked out thru 2"" plus of water in places . But still a good 16"" - 24"" of ice .CleatS and absolute must Hales Bombardiers ,trucks ,atvs and sleds still on the ice.   Hut hadn't moved an inch , but now anchored we won't have to worry.  Some livestock on the way home , I am sure they are finding it a lot easier to move about .   Saturday conditions for Tylers event should be good , maybe a bit icey but cold temps should solidify everything nicely.Snowing in barrie right now (about 1""+) and if thems drop fast enough (1 degree now)might make for good walking on saturday .

305465,Terry,2009-02-12 19:10:00,14456,wow lots of water  I hope everything freezes  up and a bit of snow before saturday
305472,tinbanger,2009-02-12 19:25:00,1028,Lot of water for sure wouldn't want to drop your sandwich  The outflow of the river has created a lake on top of a lake just out past Hales place . That where I took pic of my feet !  TB
305532,codered,2009-02-12 21:32:00,123,Yup she is a wett one . I saw 2 foot white capps in a near by corn field .. 
305838,Sinker,2009-02-13 04:45:00,8692,I came off the ice at beaverton around 5pm. The pics you posted.....are nothing compared to what it was then. The whole place was JAMMED with HUGE chunks of ice!! Quite the difference from w hen we went out this morning!  BTW....the whities were on fire today out there.  Sinker
