305476,Fang,2009-02-12 19:37:00,1330,Last night I drove buy 16 mile creek in Oakville right by the Go station. There was a mud line still left in the snow about 15ft higher than the river level last night. That would have been something to see. Will check it out tonight as I think the river surged and let loose last night but should be very high again this afternoon.
