I took a sales/desk job here in Toronto 4 years ago.  The first year I was here, I was eating the same quantity and Quality (ya right) of meals I did when I worked physically.  I went from 185lbs to 228lbs!  I was really over weight for my body style!  I felt horrible and a check up from the doctor confirmed that my health was terrible too!  I got a dog, changed my diet and started to do a lot more outdoor stuff.  I am now consistantly 195lb.  I feel and look a whole lot better!  The women folk seem to think so as well!  Bonus!  Ab"
305726,lunkerbasshunter,2009-02-13 02:10:00,2585,congrats that is a great accomplisment for both of you!!!  Cheers!
306045,grt1,2009-02-13 19:27:00,638,"Congratulations, I don't know how old you are but as you age losing gets tougher.  a few years ago when I started building my house I dropped from 250 to 200, probably worked it off carrying lumber etc, but after the hard work was done the weight started creeping back up,  I ended up 2 years ago at 270.  My scale, if it could talk, would have said ""come back when you're alone""  anyway started dieting by just cutting back then last august I hadmy top teeth pulled and got dentures, I lost another 20 pounds since then and am down to 229, I think its because I don't enjoy my food with the plastic in my mouth.  Keep up the good work, but remember, the odd ""low cal beer"" won't hurt in the summer (I consider almost any beer ""low cal"" in the summer)"
