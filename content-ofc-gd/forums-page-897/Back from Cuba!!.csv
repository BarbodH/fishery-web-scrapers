304509,cram,2009-02-10 19:11:00,1733,"I stayed there a couple of years ago and one of the guests at the resort next door would take a hobi cat out fishing directly in front of NH Krystal.....caught a giant snapper, and while pulling it in a shark bit it in half.   Quite the pics afterwards :-)"
304561,DRIFTER_016,2009-02-10 21:06:00,10439,This sucks!!!! I was expecting scantily clad cuban girls.
304565,Forester,2009-02-10 21:14:00,46,Looking for a great report
304567,Joey,2009-02-10 21:15:00,9122,"Well, tap, tap, tap......  Good to have you back Fidel.  looking forward to the report.  Joey"
304568,Raf,2009-02-10 21:17:00,3495," pics of said scenery?  otherwise, i don't believe you!"
304635,Cudz,2009-02-10 23:30:00,2652, Do you mean the nice sand and the palm trees and the beautiful blue water?
304870,scuro2,2009-02-11 04:45:00,904,"While we are waiting, anyone going March Break? I'll be on the neighbouring island Cayo Guillermo. Thinking of spending some cake and doing a day of serious fishin'. Pm me if your interested."
304884,Sinker,2009-02-11 06:37:00,8692,  I have a buddy going there the last week of Feb. I'll let ya know how he makes out. Have you ever been before? Any tips to offer?  Sinker
305130,Streamerguy,2009-02-11 22:39:00,121,Is this report gonna happen soon? I have to go fishing next week!!
305157,Greencoachdog,2009-02-11 23:49:00,8163,I see Slackdrifter has been taking slacking lessons from the Snag type slackard!!!  Don't make me have to come up there and put a boot in your butt boy!!!   ... you have until 8pm EST to have that report on my desk son!
305362,highdrifter,2009-02-12 14:06:00,2534,"And it shall be done!  I just have alot on my plate.  Plus I'm just having a heck of a time resizing the photos.  This 250kb size restriction is pretty brutal, when you've got files that generaly hover around 3000kb!!  I'm using a batch image resizer right now and it's just too freakin slow.  If there's a site where I can upload my pictures and specify the size I want at the same time, I wanna know!  Either way, I'll wrap it up tonight.  Sorry for the delay!  HD"
305367,The Urban Fisherman,2009-02-12 14:17:00,2050," Hey dude,  I use a mac and re-size my photos in ""i-photo"" but they also automatically resize when i upload them to Photobucket.  It  takes 5 minutes to set up an account and makes your life much easier.  You can just select a whole folder of pictures, hit upload and walk away until it's done.  Cheers, UF"
305371,Leecher,2009-02-12 14:26:00,7832, Like UF said.... Photobucket the way to go.... very easy.  Just make sure you set the resize option before you start uploading.  LM
305376,highdrifter,2009-02-12 14:43:00,2534," Thanks UF.  I was told to try this website...  I'll tinker with it tonight!!  What about uploading videos?!  I've got some great stuff to share, but I'd to try something other than youtube..."
305377,highdrifter,2009-02-12 14:44:00,2534, Merci Grand!!
305522,scuro2,2009-02-12 21:16:00,904,  Sure lots of tips. It's a different type of fishing. First thing you gotta do is figure out what sort of fish you want to catch. Cuda being the easiest target.
