305946,tinbanger,2009-02-13 15:05:00,1028,"Dropped by for a look see this morning.  all froze up nicely , ramp is accesible and vehicles are travelling out to the whitefish grounds , Bit slippery so cleats would help.  Not good for sleds due to 0 snow coverage.     Did speak with one returning fisherman , who claimed 14"" of ice straight out ion 80 feet of water. No info on the bite."
