The place they are staying at is right around the corner from cabelas. Well there particular cabelas has Terminator T-2 spinners on sale for $2 ..... I want to see what colors they have but I cant seem to find the T-2 on the cabelas site or the BPS site. Only the T-1  Can anyone tell me the difference betweeen the two ?  Im thinking I need black, Chartreuse, and white...  Thanks  PS they also have powerbaits on for $.99 !!! thats a pretty fancy deal I think !"

I think its in dundee?  not sure how far from the border that is though.  I have never used terminator baits before but have heard some really good things about the quality.  Cheers!
305768,scuro2,2009-02-13 03:01:00,904,I used to be in love with spinnerbaits and their product in particular. They made different weighted lures and had some large 1 ounce spinners and small bass spinners. I see they don't make them anymore. I'm down to my last small spinner.  Liked their inline spinners too.
305776,PatrickGG,2009-02-13 03:05:00,562,"T1's aint to bad the only problem i had with them is the paint chips off easy, just give them a coat of nail polish hardner to prolong the paint from chipping off."
305890,singingdog,2009-02-13 12:12:00,1047,"T2's are great spinnerbaits, especially at that price! They use slightly cheaper components on the T2's, but they still catch fish, and they still stand up to abuse better than a steel-frame spinnerbait."
