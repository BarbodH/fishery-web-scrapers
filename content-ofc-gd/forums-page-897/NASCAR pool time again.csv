305470,Daplumma,2009-02-12 19:17:00,1961,"Dan,did you figure out how to get your team picked yet? Joe"
305473,danc,2009-02-12 19:28:00,4677,"Hi Joe. Yes I did figured it out. You'll see a ""bench"" player under each set of picks. In the first and last group you must pick your driver and a ""bench"" driver. In the second group you pick your 2 drivers and 2 ""bench"" drivers. Then you'll be able to submit your picks. Don't ask me what the bench driver is for though. Good luck!!"
305498,misfish,2009-02-12 20:30:00,29133,Made my picks.I dont know what the becnh thing is?  Was at work and the light came on the dual was on.Home and watching now. Nice race by Gordon and a real nice save by the pole sitter Truex.

Once again I've created a group for OFC members only in Yahoo fantasy racing. It's just a fun thing that us fishing/racing fans can enjoy throughout the year. It takes only minutes per week to pick your drivers, so if you're not sure about signing up, don't hesitate to give it a try. If it's not your cup of tea, there's no commitment to participate the entire season.  To sign up, click HERE to get to the main page. If you don't already have one, create an identity. Then click ""Join a Group"". Select ""Join a Private Group"". Enter group ID# 3363, and Password ""hookontario"".  That's it.  Hope to see all of the regulars there and a some new faces as well.
