305804,irishfield,2009-02-13 04:04:00,26272,"Doesn't like that ? mark in your picture naming. Give them a name when you downsize and save like them Cuba1, 2, 3 ... 9.. a . b. c d etc.  make sure there are no spaces in your naming!!"
305811,highdrifter,2009-02-13 04:13:00,2534, Sweeet.  Thanks Wayne.  I'll giver a go.
305812,rbaquial,2009-02-13 04:15:00,968,"Hmm, I'm getting the same exact error too? this is frustrating!"
305813,Hooked,2009-02-13 04:17:00,891,"  Here ya go Make sure you copy the img tag, think you copied the direct link one."
305817,highdrifter,2009-02-13 04:20:00,2534,Still not working..  I know it's small enough cause i brought them down to 800 x 600..  Howd you do that Hooked?

305820,Hooked,2009-02-13 04:22:00,891,"Here is the img code I used, minus actually putting in ...:  http://img.photobucket.com/albums/uu148/hi.../DSC00248-1.jpg  Here is the one you used:  http://i642.photobucket.com/albums/uu148/h...pg?t=1234496651"
305822,ctdd2006,2009-02-13 04:23:00,531,"Sorry.  Didn't understand.  I clicked the link and saw the pic....thus thinking ""it looked good to me"".  Good luck.  Look forward to the rest of the pics."
305823,irishfield,2009-02-13 04:24:00,26272,I'm not sure how he got those shortened properties either Fidel... but it works if you strip everything after the .jpg
305825,Hooked,2009-02-13 04:27:00,891," And putting in img at the beginning, instead of i642.  All I did was check the code on what mine looked like and edited it on the link Fidel posted."
305827,irishfield,2009-02-13 04:28:00,26272,  Works with the i642 in it. .. just the stuff after the .jpg needs stripping. I've never used photobucket... weird you need to do this. Even right click and properties shows the ? mark and all the junk after it.
305828,Sinker,2009-02-13 04:29:00,8692,"Its so easy.  Once your pics are loaded to photobucket, copy the IMG link under the pic. Paste it into your report, and you should be golden. Under each pic, there are 4 link options, make sure you pick the IMG link.  Sinker"
