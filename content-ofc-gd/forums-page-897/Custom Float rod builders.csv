I have a few float rods that i use but id like to get this old girl back in action.   The reason i guess i dont like it is becuase it dosn't have a fixed reel seat.   I was wondering if anyone could recommend a custom rod builder that would be able to put a custom handle on this rod for me?     Thanks, Buckster"

You may want to do it yourself. It's not that hard to do. Reel seat, Cork handle, Butt cap, epoxy, sand paper and about 30 minutes work.  Muddler"
