305921,Leecher,2009-02-13 13:50:00,7832," Thanks Matt     Yes very healthy fish in both body of water.  Last night, had a couple of pieces of the whitie filet and man tasted sooo good.... can't wait to go back for some more"
303259,solopaddler,2009-02-08 14:08:00,8605,"Great job boys, nice fish!"
303263,Sinker,2009-02-08 14:18:00,8692,Nice haul fella's!! Congrats on the whitie!!!  Sinker
303265,mistyriver1,2009-02-08 14:24:00,600,"Great report, lots of different fish and all nice ones !!  Congrats."
303269,Greencoachdog,2009-02-08 14:28:00,8163,  I figured that was the case Paul... but just thought I'd mention it!  You'll get'em next time Bubba!!!
303278,Leecher,2009-02-08 15:08:00,7832,"Thanks everyone for the kind words      Had a blast yesterday.... Simply awesome  Thanks again Paul and Kevin!!  Will have to do it again soon Jacques   Joey, out here we are allowed 5 lines per person but only use 3 and a jigging rod most times   I think so Glen.... I'm just not fast enough with the camera to snap a pic of him before he put his catches back into the hole Hahahaha!!"
303279,kickingfrog,2009-02-08 15:12:00,8333,Nice job Ahab.
303297,TroutnMuskieHunter,2009-02-08 15:48:00,1362," I know exactly where you went Paul   how thick was the ice off the ice road??....I'm hoping that after we get this warmer weather forecasted this week and rain, I'll be able to bring the ATV up and drive to the ""new"" hot spot!!......Not to keen on walking one KILOMETER  through knee high snow and 6"" of slush.... but then again, Kevin's a young lad and can carry our stuff"
303312,trapshooter,2009-02-08 16:39:00,1234,"Great day Jacques!  2 lakes, 3 species, PB's - hard to beat a day like that."
303340,Leecher,2009-02-08 17:47:00,7832, Must be a good 2' feet.... It looked like they had flooded the road again.... driving on bare black ice  That sounds like a plan Steve.... would be easier then walking  Thanks Ben and Kickingfrog!!
303345,TroutnMuskieHunter,2009-02-08 18:09:00,1362," Jacques, I know the ice road thickess is over 2' because they have been flooding it and there's no snow on it...but, when we were up last weekend, there was only ~12"" of ice where we fished off of the ice road....I was just wondering what the thickness was where you guys setup camp yesterday?"
303349,Leecher,2009-02-08 18:13:00,7832," Ahhh OK... Me bad     Read your question wrong     There was 13"" of black ice where we were yesterday"
303350,Whitespinnerbait,2009-02-08 18:17:00,2038,"   8 to 12 inches...............  :unsure:   We were fishing a flat and on both sides there was current ,,, thats where the 8 inches was   :wacko:"
303353,TroutnMuskieHunter,2009-02-08 18:28:00,1362," I kinda figured the ice wasn't getting thicker just because of that pile of snow that's on top along with the slush....Hey Paul, remember how your line was going on an angle under the ice last weekend at the second place we drilled holes before lunch????  ....lot's of current"
303381,pengvaj,2009-02-08 19:49:00,10,nice catches!
303437,Greencoachdog,2009-02-08 21:45:00,8163,  I think they're actually allowed 10 lines thru the ice in Cue-beck!
303439,Leecher,2009-02-08 21:48:00,7832,"  Glen, that's down by Montreal area.... not up here, it's 5.... wish I could tho"
303445,Fishing 24/7,2009-02-08 21:56:00,709,10 lines!!!!!!!!  that WAY to many AND way to long to re set-up when you run and gun!  we are aloud 5 each but seems like we never set up 5 anyways....  jigging is #1
303446,Greencoachdog,2009-02-08 21:57:00,8163, 5 is good too Jacques!!!  It's 2.5 times more than they're allowed in Ontario!... and y'all were only usin' 3!!!  ... too lazy to drill the other 2 holes Jacques???
303449,Leecher,2009-02-08 22:06:00,7832, LOL Glen... Yeah maybe I    Hahahaha!!!   but just think for a moment.... I make my own tipups and if I had to build 10 every time I come up with a new idea     I wouldn't go out on the hard stuff at all   I think I'll stick with 5 minus 2 for now      then I have a couple for backup
303454,Greencoachdog,2009-02-08 22:16:00,8163,  They must allow 10 around Montreal because there aren't any fish there eh?  Just look at Roy and Mike the Pike's reports!!!  ... what's that you say?... what reports???  That's what I'm talking about!!!
303457,Leecher,2009-02-08 22:20:00,7832, OUCH
303663,Leecher,2009-02-09 02:27:00,7832, Thanks pengvaj!!
303667,jdmls,2009-02-09 02:35:00,575,Nice setup with the string of tipups ... looks like you guys have em dialed in !! ... congrats on the big whities !!
303678,Leecher,2009-02-09 02:56:00,7832, Thanks JDMLS.... we were able to crack the code and get into some feisty whities.... what a rush
305845,BassAsin,2009-02-13 05:01:00,806,"those are some nice lookin fish boys!    12 inch perch are tasty and so are them whites! nice size to all the fish, the eyes are prime for the pan!  looks like all the fish are healthy from out of there!  great report and thanks fer sharin nice pictures by the way!  Matt!"
303053,Leecher,2009-02-08 01:02:00,7832,"Well guys since mother nature was giving us a break this weekend with some milder weather, the plan was for Paul, Kevin and I to hit a couple of lakes today.... one for eyes early morning and the other for whities in early afternoon.  Got up at 5:00am, temperature was -12C and no wind.  Paul and I left home at 5:30am to pickup Kevin and made a pit stop to Timmies for some hot brew and the way we went, destination Lac St-Marie.  Arrived around 6:45am and got setup.  We each had 3 tip-ups rigged with dead small minnows.... here a shot of our setup    and Paul jigging away    Did not take long for the action to start     Kevin got into his first walleye, an 18"" incher....  BEAUTY!!    Then he gets another, same hole    a 17.5"" incher..... here he's holding both.... WOW    Then it's my turn with a 17"" incher    All the while Paul got a hit too but could not land it     I was thinking eye frenzy and could not believe that we just landed 3 eyes in the spawn of 30 minutes....  but all of a sudden, we get into a perch frenzy jumbo style  Kevin was first to land a 12"" incher.... incredible!!    and I landed also a 12"" incher... my personal best    Here is another one around 11""    Here's a pic of some of the ones we kept for a fry    At this point, around 10:00am, the perch were very active and diminishing our stock of minnows.  The eyes were no where to be found and decided to call it a day since we had another lake to tackle.   So we packed up and headed for our new destination.  Arrived around 11:00ish and could not decide which area of the lake to target.... decision, decision LOL  didn't have to flip a coin.... headed out to the south end of the lake only the find someone fishing the spot that we had targeted last week     and the wind was gusting pretty bad  so we decided to head to another area that was about 1000 meters away but the draw back was we had to walk there  We hit a lot of slush holes on the way there and made the walking very difficult.... once arrived, Kevin started to drill holes and got setup and started jigging.... NOTHING... Moved a little closer to an island and this is where Kevin got a hit,  fought this fish for a couple of minutes, was taking drag and lost it :-(  Moved a little closer into the channel and this is where Kevin landed his PB!!  a 4.5Lbs whitie and what a fight it was.  Took a pic while he was fighting it    After the pic, started filming with my camera but it does not have sound capabilities.... here is the vid    What a beast.... check it out!!    Then after an hour went by, was jigging a silver / blue Foxee tipped with a white fish fry and all of a sudden this fish hits my Foxee like a freight train.... BANG.... FISH ON!!  the battle lasted several minutes and was able to land my first ever whitie  MAN what a fight that thing gave me.... It was nuts... was going around the hole all the way up to the top LOL Took a couple of pics of my trophy      FINALLY THE SKUNK IS OFF LOL :-) All in all caught a dozen perch, 3 very nice eyes and 2 whities Doesn't get any better than that Hope you enjoy Jacques"
303058,smokin joe,2009-02-08 01:09:00,226,"Leechman, congrats on an excellent day of fishing and the PB's caught  These are the type of days that we are all seaching and waiting for.  Today was your day"
