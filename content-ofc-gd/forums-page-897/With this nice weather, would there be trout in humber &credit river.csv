306134,Guest buick14,2009-02-13 23:26:00,0,"Hi there  I was wondering, seeing as it has been nice weather and the water levels are high from the melted snow, what would the chance of landing some trout in humber river (up to the old mill dam) or in the credit river be?  Not the most knowledgeable trout fisherman, but would love to cast a spoon around old mill or erindale park if there are possibilities for a fish  thanks"
306140,Joeytier,2009-02-13 23:39:00,3990,Well the water would be far too muddy.
306177,moose,2009-02-14 01:14:00,266,driving by them to day the water yesterday and todya was probably up seven or eight ft hight thann what it is supposed to be
306181,aniceguy,2009-02-14 01:23:00,1094,give it ohhhh until june or so  Seriously at best mid week to come on and then there is 15 cm of snow I hear so might be my original line. . . . june

306205,kemper,2009-02-14 02:17:00,2232,There is an excellent chance there is fish in there. In fact I would say there is a 100% chance that there is a solid amount of trout.  good luck catching them without a 4 lb roe bag and a drift sock to slow your float down though
