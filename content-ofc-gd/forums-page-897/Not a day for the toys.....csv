305484,limeyangler,2009-02-12 20:09:00,5204,"Hi All,  Went out this morning locally for trout. Did not take the snowmachine or shelter because its been +4 degrees C and raining for the last 4 days....crazy! Figured the lake was gonna be knee deep slush, and was right, good day not to try and haul the shack with the heavy as a hog 600 triple! would definitely have got bogged down in the slush....so went old skool today with my trusty plastic sled and elbow grease     WENT OLD SKOOL TODAY  <embed width=""448"" height=""361"" type=""application/x-shockwave-flash"" wmode=""transparent"" src=""http://i263.photobucket.com/player.swf?file=http://vid263.photobucket.com/albums/ii158/vishuscirquel/oldscool.flv"">     Pretty slow start...not much for 1/2 hour....plenty of little guys showing on the sonar...no takers. Then it got busy........     PLENTY OF SMALL ONES TODAY  <embed width=""448"" height=""361"" type=""application/x-shockwave-flash"" wmode=""transparent"" src=""http://i263.photobucket.com/player.swf?file=http://vid263.photobucket.com/albums/ii158/vishuscirquel/trout.flv"">      Was only out for 2 hours, caught around six.....2 keepers.....rest went back. It was one heck of a  mile walk out....knee deep snow all the way.....with 8"" of slush underneath that.....but i was rewarded with supper....no complaints!      YUM!  "
