Worried about the hut blowing away, and dont really have time to go check. (and not sure if its good for the sled) I'll make the trip if I have to.  Thanks to everyone!!    Ciao  Matt."

305341,JFR,2009-02-12 12:52:00,498,"  Very strong winds and gusts here in Stroud, so unless your hut is well anchored it may be on the other side of the lake  John"

Fixing the sled today, so I'll take a rip after work tomorrow with fingers crossed. Hopefully it just flips over, and stays put.  Thanks for the responses!!"
