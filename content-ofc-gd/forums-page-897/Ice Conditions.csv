305513,Joeytier,2009-02-12 21:04:00,3990,I'd be sure to avoid places like river mouths or narrows for the time being.  Bay Bay should still have a ton of ice though.
305621,Ramble,2009-02-12 23:27:00,713,Areas out of the current should be good to go. i know the river mouth HAD lots. But with all the water moving through now i can see it loosing ice.
