305485,Gerritt,2009-02-12 20:10:00,6129,Wow.... not for me.... but hey each they're own....  Makes me think of Balut for some reason.... *Shuddder*  G
305487,Zebco,2009-02-12 20:11:00,123,The lips have to move for a good grade.   Glad I live in Canada!
305489,BUSTER,2009-02-12 20:12:00,1336,THATS INSANE!!    WOW
305496,chukkk,2009-02-12 20:22:00,57," Yeah me too we can have Maple Leaf Meat, no extra charge for the Listeria,  and Burger King with E Coli, fresh from North Bay, washed down with a good drink of Walkerton water. We are so Lucky"
305500,MCTFisher9120,2009-02-12 20:34:00,3761,that is disgusting.
305505,mukluk,2009-02-12 20:50:00,196,Might be o-kay with a little ketchup on it!
305506,Jet,2009-02-12 20:52:00,364,"It's funny that while that may not look appetizing by western standards especially when compared to a double cheeseburger and KFC, the most disgusting thing is how one's body looks after eating the latter for years. That's probably why Canada's youth, according to the World Health Organization, have the 4th highest rate for obesity.  On the flip side eating that very fresh fish and snake would be quite good for you. Ask Survivorman."
305524,Anton Kanagasuntheri,2009-02-12 21:17:00,160,"wow cool video! you should take a look at the ""Annual Rattlesnake Round-up"" in Texes"
305538,bigugli,2009-02-12 21:38:00,6138,That looks down right delish. The body has been deep fried and cooked through for an adequate amount of time.  Talk about fresh from sea to table.
305539,diggyj,2009-02-12 21:39:00,548,"Thats a delicacy over there, they will eat just about anything. Im sure if they saw some of the things we eat, it would totally gross them out to.  I tend not to eat anything that's still moving.......LOL"
305547,misfish,2009-02-12 21:50:00,29133,"Fresh is the best. I would try it.Hey, like they say,dont knock it til ya tried it."
305553,lunkerbasshunter,2009-02-12 21:55:00,2585,ewwwwww i hate snakes we should have a symbol you have to type in the title for anything that has snakes in it.  cheers!
305554,brkygetr,2009-02-12 21:56:00,425,"Wow, thats all I got."
305555,osmondrs,2009-02-12 21:58:00,61,"Take a back seat, Hell's Kitchen, here's some serious competition!"
305571,silvio,2009-02-12 22:34:00,433,I wonder is it still moves when it comes out  ... Nothing like the fish you ate for dinner swimming in your toilet later on.
305608,douG,2009-02-12 23:16:00,2693,Now that's FRESH.
305614,misfish,2009-02-12 23:23:00,29133,and healthy too to boot. Rattle snake is one of the maJor survivor eats you can live off of uncooked.Along with the porkupine.I spelt it wrong I know.
305617,Leecher,2009-02-12 23:25:00,7832,Here I thought I was cruel by reviving a perch in my kitchen sinc and put it under the knife  Now thats got to hurt  I think I'll stick with fresh water fish thank you!! Thanks for sharing Leechman
305639,Tarzan's Jane,2009-02-12 23:49:00,1183,I didn't see anyone chewing....I feel bad for that fish
305660,BassAsin,2009-02-13 00:16:00,806,Harvey's not BK hahahhah
305691,Zubris21,2009-02-13 01:02:00,563,"That seems more barbaric than the ""F word"" post from the other day."
305862,Maverick,2009-02-13 07:14:00,371,"soooo, let me get this straight, the food has to be alive when served to get the most points??? Probably wouldn't be a top seller here and I would imagine P3TA would flip a skid if it ever were.  Reminds me of the pics my buddy brought back from Taiwan, there was a Tiger, a Pig and a Golden Retriever in the same cage for a zoo like tourist attraction. The poor dog was in rough shape."
305863,rbaquial,2009-02-13 08:03:00,968," LOL....Gerritt, are you Filipino? either 1) you are, 2) you're married to one, 3) you've got a few Filipino buddies!"
