304983,John the Fisherman,2009-02-11 14:45:00,45,"Well,  The snow on the lake has gone down at least a 1/2 foot.  The ice road was a little soft on top today, with some small skims of water on top.  TFN has been plowing with the 5 ton now, and today would be a good day to plow before all those little tire ridges freeze by the weekend.  I have not been on the sled in a few days, but I will say that the snow was getting almost a bit too deep before this melt.  700's can be a bit hard on gas when driving around breaking trail.  Not tough going with a good sled. Just MPG. There is slush to be found, but it is not very deep.  I was on a lake just past that I was on a few years ago with slush over the knee.  There was none the other day.  Once it turns -17 for Fri. night that will stiffin it all up on top for sure.  It should be perfect for heading into some unbroken back lakes for specks or pike.  JTF"
304991,johnnyb,2009-02-11 14:52:00,3413,Great info John....hopefully it will all come together by the weekend....4 more sleeps for me....*sigh*
305249,walleyemaster,2009-02-12 02:14:00,325,all right...good news i think...1 more sleepie before the swim....
305775,switchback,2009-02-13 03:05:00,10,My buddy made accomodations for us at Lance Whites place (  I think )  was just wondering what the ice depth was like on the ice road as to whether I would take the truck and enclosed trailer out on the ice.  Read a little further up they were plowing with the five ton.  I have a dodge diesel and a 27 foot enclosed trailer you input would put my mind at ease.
305953,preload420,2009-02-13 15:21:00,3,hey we are heading up to that area  next weekend not quite temagami but  Tilden lake  just wondering should i bring the sled or  the 4 wheeler  ???  is there still snow up there its nice and green here
