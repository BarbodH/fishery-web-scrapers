305268,joefish,2009-02-12 03:04:00,165,Definitely gonna catch some of those shows!  That in my opinion was some of the best TV of the time!
305269,irishfield,2009-02-12 03:09:00,26272,Lot easier to pick up the 4 tape box set of the whole shebang Rob. Think we got it for $19.99....
305332,wallyboss,2009-02-12 12:22:00,1095,Costco had full series on DVD b4 XMAS.
305346,pikehunter,2009-02-12 13:06:00,1659,"Definitely one of the top TV shows of all time. I never started to watch it though until it went into it's first round of syndication back around 1980 or so. Loved the theme song too, and on the big screen version of Mash the words were sung not just a music track. M.A.S.H theme"
305359,bigugli,2009-02-12 13:48:00,6138,It was a great show. Don't know how many times I've seen every episode.  The final episode was great. So were the M.A.S.H farewell parties held at various bars and college pubs. My daughter now watches the show every day some 25 years later.
305664,Radnine,2009-02-13 00:22:00,1538,"I loved MASH, in fact I still use lines that I stole from that show. But any more, I won't watch one that Henry and Trapper aren't in. Sorry to all Potter/Charles/BJ lovers, but that show lost it when the boys left. And don't get me started on the last three seasons when the show became a ""who can yell louder than the others"" contest. Not to mention a ""let me direct this one, no let me direct this one"" contest Jim"
305684,kickingfrog,2009-02-13 00:46:00,8333,  Don't feel sorry for BJ lo.....v.....e....r. ....    never mind.
305686,FishHeadRic,2009-02-13 00:54:00,226,"  Name of the song was Suicide is painless. Still one of my favorite shows ever! ...""Frank Burns eats worms""   FHR"
305688,BassAsin,2009-02-13 00:56:00,806,http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mlObZqhUWpg   i must say i was a fan of hogan's heroes too!
305761,Radnine,2009-02-13 02:53:00,1538,"The funniest episode I remember was when Carter reveals that he is of native descent so Hogan decides to have him shoot a truck going by the camp with a flaming arrow. He hauls back and hits the divider in the window. Newkirk (Richard Dawson) grabs the arrow and the bow and says ""no wonder you lost the bloody west"" then shoots the truck. I think you can youtube the scene. It is priceless. Jim"
