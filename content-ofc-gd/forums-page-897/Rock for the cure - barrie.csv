305219,misfish,2009-02-12 01:28:00,29133," Can you clarify on this? I may get the munchies?LOL  Me and the mrs,s are looking forward to this night."
305224,irishfield,2009-02-12 01:36:00,26272,I will as soon as the Mrs. gets back thru the fog from Barrie... she's at a meeting and moving the auction items to the hall...or at least they were supposed to but the basement storage area at the hall is flooded so not sure! Her sister went with her to drive and carry!
305730,irishfield,2009-02-13 02:12:00,26272,Brian... since you're on a health kick.. veggy platters and dip.   ..for me there will be meat and cheese platters and sandwiches !!  Remember these are snacks.. and you are expected to eat before you come! lol  Oh BTW.. the bar is cash only. Silent auction items are cash and they have also made arrangements to take Credit Cards.
