As I was unloading my items on the conveyor belt to check out, a drunk man standing behind me watched as I placed the items in front of the cashier.  While the cashier was ringing up the purchases, the drunk  calmly stated, ""You must be single.""  I was a bit startled by this proclamation, but I was intrigued by the derelict's intuition, since I was indeed single.  I looked  at the six items on the belt and saw nothing  particularly unusual about my selections that could have tipped off the drunk to my marital status.  Curiosity getting the better of me, I said, 'Well, you know what, you're absolutely right. But how on earth did you know that?'  The drunk replied,  'Cause you're ugly.'  Never question a drunk"
