Its quite common for comercial fishing boats to harvest $1000's of dollars of fish over their quotas, then get slapped with a $2000 fine... and making a large profit on their over harvest.  Just wonder what the fishery would be like without comercial fishing"

463170,Billy Bob,2010-05-05 11:57:00,5865,NYS bought out their commercial fishing fleets over 20 years ago using a $3 Lake Erie Stamp that was mandatory for all sport fishermen...it was suppose to be a 3 year thing but after 2 years they had enough money and canceled the stamp for the third year....Meanwhile the other states outlawed gill nets in the US and most all commercial fishing has ended on our side of Lake Erie....now it's up to you guys to put pressure on your government.
