Had we paid the $10 for the resort pool we would have landed $600, but hey thats  hindsite!Highlight of sunday afternoon was me falling out of my boat when pulling up the troling motor, man 55 degree water is brisk, and thanks George for pulling me out after you got done laughing!It was great to meet some guyz off the board and put faces to names, overall i think we had a great weekend, and Rob George sayz you have to come along again because he is going to need a camera guy again LOL!Dave wished you guyz could have done better, but from what i hear it was tough all over, theres always next time, stay in touch!All our fish were caught very shallow 10-4 feet of water, also my 7.7 pounder was only 1 inch shorter than Georges 9.8, amazing what a inch can do! Thanks again guyz for a great weekend! WAyne Rob a.k.a kickinfrog  Dave a.k.a Grimace  George  Myself  Georges 9th place walleye 9.8  This is literally minutes before i fell into the water!  "

Trolled long reach, worked shermans, dragged cranks around with planer boards.  Oh well.  A good time was had by all.  I would do it again in a second."
