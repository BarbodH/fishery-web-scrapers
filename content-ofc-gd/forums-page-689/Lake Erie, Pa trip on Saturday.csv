463164,fish_fishburn,2010-05-05 10:35:00,1311,"Those are hogs, wow."
463166,mj2112,2010-05-05 11:17:00,46,Thanks for the comments about the fish she caught.  I just wanted to share them because I like looking at your pictures of fish you all catch.   NO regrets about releasing it and seeing it swim away.  We just enjoy fishing. Not sure why there is skepticism on the pics.  We didn't enter any contests or submit the fish to any bait shop to be considered as a record.  I just posted them on here for other fisherman/woman to enjoy.  If you remember she caught a similar bass last year and it was posted on here.  She fished 3 times in Erie and has caught 2 fish that were once in lifetime bass.  Maybe beginners luck; I'd like to think it was me who put her on the fish!
463167,Roy,2010-05-05 11:25:00,13728,"Don't worry about any perceived scepticism, Mike. It's some folks' way of telling you how awesome a catch it is. Keep up the great fishing with your sweetie. And whatever you do, please don't stop sharing pics of your catch. Thanks"
463221,Gerry,2010-05-05 14:33:00,257,"Well, a record fish could mean a bunch of cash. You don't have to kill it to weigh it in at an official scale station. The record smallmouth in North America is 10lbs, 14 oz. and by the looks of yours it has to be all of that. My 7.3 lbs smallmouth was entered in a tournament and won me the event as well as the big fish contest....I did release it. I've got a pic of mine and I'll post it here if I can ever figure out how to do that. In the meantime, I can tell you that it's a dwarf compared to yours.....man, that's a big fish!"
462174,mj2112,2010-05-02 22:52:00,46,  Avid reader of the topics here; just nothing to add most of the time.  Wanted to share some of pics of our fishing trip yesterday. Also wanted to brag to Marty who reads these posts.  My girlfriend out fishes Marty!  Coming to Canada in June and looking forward to catching some similar fish up there.  Always have a great time in Canada.  Mike 
462176,danbouck,2010-05-02 22:56:00,4380,Those are huge!
462199,ld17,2010-05-02 23:40:00,319,the word freaking football comes to mind.  Unreal thanks for the pics.
462202,Ben_Daniels,2010-05-02 23:43:00,435,Wow is she just really small and things look huge in her hands?   Either way those are some pigs!!!  -Ben
462203,TC1OZ,2010-05-02 23:47:00,987,GIANT FISH MAN! even if your wife is 4ft nothing those are GIANTS loloool. Let me know if your fishing Fort Erie.. I can show you some hot spots!
462217,Radnine,2010-05-03 00:11:00,1538,"Ummm, I think I'm calling you on this one. Jim"
462224,mj2112,2010-05-03 00:21:00,46,I just fish Presque Isle bay down to North East Marina in Pennsylvania.  I haven't fished other area's of the Lake.  I appreciate the offer tho.  This is the second time I took my girlfriend there and look what she does.  If you can look back in my post from last year she caught another monster.  beginners luck i guess.
462225,irishfield,2010-05-03 00:22:00,26272,"Jim's not ""calling you"" on the size of the fish !!! He's calling you to see if he can take your GF out fishing...."
462229,mj2112,2010-05-03 00:26:00,46,I was wondering!  Nope she is a keeper!
462235,Leecher,2010-05-03 00:48:00,7832,Awesome Mike!!! huge bronze backs Congrats Leechman
462253,mj2112,2010-05-03 01:21:00,46,Thanks Leechman...I didnt do anything except take the picture!
462501,Gerry,2010-05-03 16:38:00,257,"That's a huge smallmouth. Did you get a weight and measure? My PB is 7.3lbs which measured 21"" x 18.5"" girth. This one looks bigger and if it is, could be close to a record."
462511,fish-miester,2010-05-03 16:58:00,864,saweet!
462571,Marty,2010-05-03 19:08:00,873,I hate to admit it but they are pigs. Mike isn't one to tell stories so I have to believe him.
462574,anders,2010-05-03 19:12:00,1168,Drool....  I mean nice fish    Seriously some hogs there.
462578,Harrison,2010-05-03 19:28:00,2202,"Holy smokes, those are giants.  Screw Dunkirk!"
462701,Spiel,2010-05-04 01:01:00,9065,"Reduced to a single word.....""Damn!"""
462750,Radnine,2010-05-04 02:23:00,1538,"Okay, so I am the only guy that thinks something looks fishy here? (pun intended) That last picture is either a 12 lb smallie or a 40 lb girlfriend. Either one of which would be a record. I mean, they look like those salmon pillows that they sell at Bass Pro. If it is real, then hats off brother (on both counts  ) but those look like the kind of bass that people catch in the Caribbean, or just off Three Mile Island. I remain dubiously yours, Jim"
462884,Marty,2010-05-04 15:29:00,873,"I don't think Mike is smart enough to doctor those pics.  Not to mention, he's a cop and he's as straight as they come.   I guess the ultimate compliment for a fish is to have someone doubt it's as big as it is.   Congrats Mike."

462914,solopaddler,2010-05-04 17:08:00,8605,"I'll eat my eat if those fish aren't legit. Truly big specimens, just awesome.  Some people have a hard time with fish sizes. Case in point the 32"" 20lb steelhead that was posted a while back."
462981,JohnF,2010-05-04 20:21:00,3494, Please tell me she's like 3 feet tall and weighs less than 50#. Those are huge otherwise. Are there steroids in the water?  JF
463076,Radnine,2010-05-05 00:44:00,1538,  The cream is starting to rise to the top. Jim
463107,WeedLine,2010-05-05 01:45:00,322,Those are some big smallmouth. Congrats to your girl.
463108,Daplumma,2010-05-05 01:46:00,1961,"I'll vouch for Marty knowing pigs,he's a (pig) Pen fan!Nice fish,ignore the haters.Okay,dont ignore the haters,just roll your eyes and snicker at them like everyone else does. Joe"
