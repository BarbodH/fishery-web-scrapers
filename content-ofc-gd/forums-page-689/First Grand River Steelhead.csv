462689,Drock6687,2010-05-04 00:36:00,90,I never would have guessed that there where steelhead in the grand untill i started fising for them this year and caught my first one today...about 4 or 5 lbs but some nice colours in it...also went to a local trout creek and caught 11 small rainbows and 2 small browns... all in all besides the sun burn it was a good day fising today!  http://i845.photobucket.com/albums/ab12/drock6687/grandmay510.jpg
462714,Marko,2010-05-04 01:25:00,854,My understanding is that they make it all the way up to Paris. But the closer you get to lake Erie the more common they are. If you ever drive through Caledonia stop by the dam and you`ll see people shoulder to shoulder fishing for rainbows.
462732,BillsTheBassMan,2010-05-04 01:44:00,932, Nice Fish Drock!
462764,kennyman,2010-05-04 03:32:00,737,"That certainly is a nice fish, Nice job. Thanks for sharing. What did you catch it on ?"
462781,fatherof3,2010-05-04 04:34:00,1769,"nice fish,congrats.As Marko said we do get them all the way to Paris but they cant get over the dam in town.For sure more common the closer you get to Lake Erie.Again,nice fish"
462811,Drock6687,2010-05-04 12:04:00,90, Thanks I caught it on a mepps agila #3 single hook
462838,Leecher,2010-05-04 13:34:00,7832,Nice one Drock     Congrats on your first Leechman
462875,steelhead197,2010-05-04 14:54:00,38,"You know what......that's a great catch, congrats!!!  Having caught and seen many steelhead out of the Grand over the last decade.....I would venture an estimated ""guess"" that the fish you caught there, is a ""resident"" trout.....does not look like the steelhead caught from the river. Anyone else local to the area agree?  Awsome specimen Drock!!!"
462891,fatherof3,2010-05-04 15:53:00,1769,you could be right Shaynebow.Here is a pic of one caught last year from the Grand in Paris before season closed for comparison. 
463145,steelie hunter,2010-05-05 03:25:00,55,"I'd say its just a dropback with nice colours. Looks like a migrating trout to me. I find resident trout are normally covered head to tail in spots...  Nice fish either way though, very pretty"
