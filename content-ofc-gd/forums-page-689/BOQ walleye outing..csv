462204,Roy,2010-05-02 23:48:00,13728,Lloyd (fishhunter) has an open day on Sunday May 9th. I can't make that one (doing the 15th). Who's interested in going? Make an OFC get together of it. Temps are looking good already. PM fishhunter for details.....It won't break the bank...trust me.
462218,fishhunter,2010-05-03 00:12:00,604,"Just so people know, I'm just looking to cover my operating costs for that day. Based on 4 people."
462236,asdve23rveavwa,2010-05-03 00:48:00,2690,"Crap, if it was the 8th I would probably be all over it...working a half day on Sunday!"
462280,Mike the Pike,2010-05-03 01:57:00,3421,"Hey Roy I hope the bite will be on for ya this was my Worst Quinte opener as I try for the big one,I know how to catch wee ones but they don't win tournaments.  Strange weekend even my favorite pike spots were no longer available due to very low water levels.Lots of perch caught.I did see Lloyd out there this morning doing his thing I hope he was catching because I was not.My fishing partner landed a nice one Saturday morning 6lbs 2oz.I will be back in the BOQ May 28th for a 3 day weekend don't worry I know Lloyd will put ya on fish .Enjoy his big comfy Princecraft."
462287,fishhunter,2010-05-03 02:05:00,604,I seen you . It was my best opener ever and got to fish in my shorts lol.Fish were on good both days. biggest fish was 11.1

462982,solopaddler,2010-05-04 20:24:00,8605,Bad timing for me otherwise I'd love to join.
462989,Terry,2010-05-04 20:46:00,14456,man I wish I could go  if anyone wants to learn how to get walleye..from BOQ a trip with Lloyd is one of the best ways..it's like getting years of practice squeezed into one day
463004,bukee,2010-05-04 21:23:00,58,"I am pysched to fish and learn from a pro like Lloyd and just have a fun day on the water.  Was at BOQ for our annual opener trip, we did well, had my first 10 plus walleye day on  BOQ opener, just no size but still lots of fun.  We couldnt find fish in the narrows or Hay Bay where we had success in past years, but we found lots of 2 to 4lbers in Long Reach, which we never had much success at before.  Jose I live in Toronto, if you want to drive up together, let me know.  Carm"
463031,irishfield,2010-05-04 22:52:00,26272,Like Terry said.. you never know what you might get Walleye fishing with Lloyd..  
463056,fishhunter,2010-05-04 23:52:00,604,"Walleye dreamer is in,so one spot left"
463059,irishfield,2010-05-04 23:57:00,26272,You're a good man Lloyd.. and also the only Charter/guide I know that fills in his down days with (at cost) tours for strangers... just to stay sharp and on the fish!
463264,fishhunter,2010-05-05 17:10:00,604,"ok so hear is the OFC team for sunday Bukee, Jose, Walleye dreamer and Younge one  Look forward to enjoying a day on the water with you all."
463271,young_one,2010-05-05 17:38:00,620,"Reporting in! I'll be leaving TO Friday night, Sat, bottom bouncing Deseronto with techniques I've had success past few years Sun, Lloyd will show me the ways of trolling for Spring walleye  I'll have a full report of both days when I'm back, praying for small wind and cloudy sky for the weekend."
463272,Headhunter,2010-05-05 17:38:00,5703,"Have blast everyone! Lloyd, I tried to get out of this weekends commitments, but my wife insisted that I be home for my son's birthday party! LOL BTW - rumour has it that the White Perch of Quinte have gone into hiding after seeing cruise around last weekend... that's ok though, cause Dano won't be on board this weekend! LOL HH"
