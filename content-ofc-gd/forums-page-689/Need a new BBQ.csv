462494,DRIFTER_016,2010-05-03 16:23:00,10439,You need a real MANS BBQ. Look no further as you have come to the right place. Here are a few of my favorite MANBQ's!!!!!!!  Number one:    Number two:    Number three:    Number four:    Number five:    Number six:    Here's the story behind this last one. 
462535,JohnF,2010-05-03 17:45:00,3494,"I like the Sprite, or is it a Midget? Great way to use yer race car after you lunch the last engine.  I saw the V8 BBQ advertised on the Nascar show this weekend. Looks great.  One thing I will never do again with any BBQ is put a cover over it. All the cover does is encourage moisture to accumulate and rust everything. Also when I buy my next unit I'll just make sure the burner & grilles are easy to buy & replace.  Having had both I think I prefer cooking with propane over natural gas but I really like the convenience of gas. It would be nice to see the unit in operation to make sure the heat is evenly distributed but that isn't always easy to arrange.  JF"
462540,Gerritt,2010-05-03 17:55:00,6129,"Well I am still in the hunt.. I priced out the BGE, 1600.00 all in... jesus, I like the concept and I am sure the food is amazing.... but this is more then I anticipated. And to be honest... it does not feel like it is worth that kind of $$. Some ceramic, paint and a hinge.  Well the hunt continues for me to find my perfect BBQ...   I might just have to purchase a charcoal cheapie to hold me over.... Till I find the right one for me.  G"

462557,bigugli,2010-05-03 18:20:00,6138,These folks are running an ad on Webers. Just got it in the paper. I've had only good experience with the brand.  http://www.suncountryleisure.com/
462569,Gerritt,2010-05-03 18:57:00,6129,"Well, I pulled the trigger... and purchased a new BBQ (as I am going nutso without one), I went back to the BBQ store and looked around... I wanted something that was simple to operate for the lady of the house, was quick to make burgers Hotdogs etc... and something that allows me to smoke, and cook with charcoal as well. (Nothing beats charcoal in my opinion)  And I found the unit I have been looking for. A Napolean P450RB, It allows me to do all these things all in one unit. I just add a tray, fill it with charcoal light the charcoal using the propane burners and Now I am cooking with charcoal on my gas grill! add in some hardwood chunks and now I am smoking as well!  This unit to me offered the best of both worlds, gas convenience, and smoking, charcoal functionality!  all coming in at about half the price of what I was looking at!  Thank you everyone for you're input, it certainly helped me in finding the unit right for me!   G"

462606,Jer,2010-05-03 20:51:00,1426,"You'll be happy with that unit for sure. It's the same as mine (P450) but with the rear rotisserie burner.  I haven't tried the charcoal tray (did you get the tray with it?), but as a propane grill, it's been awesome.  This is mine new last year:  "
462645,Gerritt,2010-05-03 22:23:00,6129,"they were offering a chicken roaster with the unit... well I did not see the need for it as it came with the rotisserie , so I swapped out the chicken roaster for the charcoal box  , I also got a free HD cover and bag of charcoal.  It will arrive tomorrow, going to take the time to season it.... then steaks on the BBQ!!!   G."
462660,skeeter,2010-05-03 23:16:00,1907,"well I'm a dollar short and a day late, but here's mine.  the wife and i are in walmart and we see a real nice bar-b-q for $800. i laughed at her and said hell will freeze over before i spend that kind of money on one. as time goes on , every time were in walmart we go look at it, say yup its nice but not at that price. 1 day the wife comes home from walmart with trackers wife and after we are done drinking our timmies, the wife say's ""oh by the way, you know that bar-b-q that we love is on clearance right now"". ya thats nice dear, what did they do drop it by $50 lol nope its marked down to $300, ya right lol. trackers wife says , yup thats what it says. tracker jumps into my van with me to give me a hand with it and off we go. get to walmart and sure enough theres 4 left . tracker liked it to, so he sits on 2 of the boxes while i go to get a flat cart to load them onto. after buying both we had a walmart employee help us load them into the van. 3 guys to pick them up, never realized how heavy those damn things are. get them back to the park, open the box and put them together. hot damn, made my old one look like a toaster oven lol  6 cast iron burners in the bottom, rotisserie burner in the back and the rotisserie motor set,and a side burner for $300 wasnt a bad deal as far as i am concerned........

462703,Spiel,2010-05-04 01:06:00,9065,Anything over a $50 charcoal BBQ Gerritt is a down payment on a boat.
462706,Gerritt,2010-05-04 01:11:00,6129,"  LOL Chris! I already have an under utilized boat... but boy do I like my BBQ! You are right those cheapies were awesome.. I can remember in my youth, dad would set it up on the beach on St. John and the steaks off that thing were amazing! a bit burnt from my recollection... but amazing!  G."
462797,Billy Bob,2010-05-04 10:56:00,5865,"Skeeter didn't get a deal he got a STEAL........a couple of years ago the Sam's Club Grills had the grills with cast iron burners and a cast iron side burner...those are the one's to get IF you can...now the stainless steel burners are as thin as a piece of paper......I have a Ducane and the only thing that hasn't gone on that grill is the burners....paid over $1000.00 10 years ago on that puppy...on my deck I have three grills...The Ducane, a New Braunfelds that burns wood/charcoal for BBQ and has a bottom box for smoking my fish/meat and a open pit fire that has a swing in grill...  The best thing I ever cooked on my Braunfelds using charcoal was a 8.5 lb standing rib roast...I still dream about eating that beast.  OK, since it's grilling season I will share with my good Canadian friends a secret to the BEST way to cook chicken without par boiling it or anything else....ready.....it's real hard to remember....here goes.  Preheat your propane/gas grill for 10/15 minutes...clean grills......put 1/2 chickens BONE SIDE DOWN and close cover...turn the grill down on LOW and drink beer for 45 minutes (do NOT raise the grill cover before the 45 minutes)...check to see if the skin is nice and crispy...if not one more beer or 10/15 minutes....that's it....we call it NO TURN CHICKEN so NEVER TURN IT...with the bones down the skin tightens up around the meat and seals in the juices that flare up the grill. If you burn it a bit only the bones get burn's and not the meat...EVERYONE I have shared this way to cook chicken now only uses this method...sometimes on my grill if it's windy I have to turn the grill up to medium or the flame blows out so I just put the chicken on the upper warming rack...works the same.  Enjoy, Bob"
462802,Fisherman,2010-05-04 11:21:00,7201,"Nice camp grill, works well but, I think you really need to get back to nature a bit more....motorhome is overkill, I see a basic hutchie in your future.."
462808,pikehunter,2010-05-04 11:41:00,1659," You grabbed the words right out of my mouth Wayne.  Sorry Gerritt but every time I walk in the door at work I pass by a whole floor full of shiny new BBQ's just begging me to look at them, and I say sorry, but I can burn my burgers just as fast and easy on my old $150 grill I bought 10 or eleven years ago.  I can't imagine spending as much or more on a BBQ to sit out in the rain than for a stove for stove to sit in the warmth of my kitchen.  Whatever you buy enjoy it and dine on many fine meals for years to come."
462853,Flappn,2010-05-04 13:59:00,245,"Comment to the post above about the CTC 12 year old bbq....they don't make them like they used to..even the cheapies.  At the end of the day every company is off shoring some sort of their building process....now a day's you have to look at how much of it is made in Canada and how much control does the Canadian division have. Napoleon is one of the top of the line bbq's and 90% of the time (I have been fooled) you get what you pay for.  I just bought a Napoleon Prestige I P450 to replace my 6 year old $600 Centro that cooks uneven, is rusted, has warped dial control's, rotted out cast burners and drip tray's.....it's now off to the Garbage. The Frame actually started to rust after 2 years..and I kept it covered..anyway.  I do like the ""Big Green Egg"" thought...where was that when I was researching bbq's........"
462915,Fish4Eyes,2010-05-04 17:11:00,1022,"I did my research, and in conclusion I would not recommend anything but a Weber or Napolean. DO NOT buy a bbq made in china no matter who makes it. Go into the store and compare a Weber to any other and the difference in price is very clear. There is other aspects to consider as well, like un-even heat distribution that the cheap bbq's are notorious for. If your looking at a Weber, I recommend the S320 Natural Gas. Mine is on order as we speak. Google Canadian Appliance, they are the cheapest around, by far."
462921,Headhunter,2010-05-04 17:35:00,5703,"Hey Billybob, that chicken recipe is exactly how I made two chickens on Sunday. Local grocery store had chicken on sale, two for the price of one, so I cut them in half, spiced them and put them on the grill bone side down... I like this method better then ""beer can"" chicken as they are easier to serve when the are already cut in half. I know there are guys here who shake their heads at those of us who spend some pretty significant $ on BBQ's, but to my mind I get great value... here's the math. My Vermont Castings cost me just over $1,500.00 almost 11 years ago. I use it atleast 200 times a year, so annually, it cost me about $135.00 to own this BBQ to date. Now factor in the 200 plus meals I get to make on a BBQ that has all the bells and whistles and the BBQ cost me $.68 per meal it cooks. There's value in that to me. One this to consider with an upper level BBQ, properly maintained, you will not get flare ups... heck, I bet I could cook a pound of bacon on the grills with little to no flare up, no food wasted and everything evenly cooked. Try that with your $150.00 CTC special. G... I hope that BBQ gives you and the family many years of cooking pleasure! HH PS... Costco strip loins, the ""Canadian AAAA"" ones... it don't get better than that!"
462959,Billy Bob,2010-05-04 19:18:00,5865," YES, it's the easiest way to cook chicken by far....I like to soak the bird in Chiavetta's Marinate overnight...(the three on the FAR LEFT)....http://www.chiavettas.com/our_products.php3"
462960,Headhunter,2010-05-04 19:37:00,5703,"Billybob, if I am able to plan out a day in advance, I use a simple no name Italian salad dressing for a chicken maranaide. My dry rub is as follows: -3 parts each of: Kosher salt, black pepper, garlic powder and paprika -1 part each of: oregeon, basil, onion powder, thym, ceyene powder, Makes a great rub for both chicken and especially pork. HH Also, if I'm in a hurry, I will ""nuke"" the chicken while I am waiting for the BBQ to heat... reduced ""Q"" time by about 15-20 minutes."

This is about the best built BBQ I've ever come across. 10 year replacement warranty on the burners, lifetime on most everything else.  I got a simple 3 burner unit (no side burner or rear rotisserie) for $800. The thing is a breeze to take apart and clean, gives good even heat and best of all, it's built in Ontario (though some models are now built in China). I couldn't be happier, and believe me, I had no plans of spending $800 on a BBQ at the time. I'm hoping it's the last one I ever have to buy."

I've cooked over an open fire with wood (fishing trips) never tasted anything better especially when using pine.  Keep them well maintained and they will last a long time.

I paid $1,200.00 for a fancy stainless steel Ducane.  Turns out, Ducane sold out to Weber a while back.  Turns out this piece of crap was built offshore and is no longer made. I found this out when all five  burners rotted out after the first year. They were pretty good about supplying burners under warranty, but what happens when the warranty runs out? Very disappointed to say the least. I've had the $149.00 ones from CTC or Zellers that lasted much longer than this one will.  I thought I was buying a deluxe unit made by a premier North American manufacturer. Apparently, not everything is as it appears.  I did buy a Natural Gas model though which is very nice to have. No more running out for Propane.  Good Luck!"

I am also looking at the Crown 90  I was also looking at a charcoal unit (I still prefer charcoal) but they are impractical for whipping up a few sausages or burgers on a whim..

The rotisserie with the main burners off and a drip pan is a joy to use after the old one with constant flare ups cause you cooked with the main burners on rotisserie. Nothing beats seasoned cast iron grill grates either, ocassional scrub down and brush with oil ."

I'm on my 11th season with my Vermont Castings, but I would not recommend them to anyone, not based on their product, but based on their lack of customer service. As someone already mentioned, the Big Green Egg should be somehting to consider. althought they are charcoal based, their design will have you cooking in ten minutes and they will give you the convenience of a gas grill, with all the goodness you get from a charcoal grill. Key things to seek when purchasing a BBQ: -weight... a good indicator of the grills ability to retain heat which provides a platform for even cooking. -no ""H"" burners...please! -cast iron or stainless steel grills -save some dough on accessories... if you aren't gonna use them, don't buy them! Hope this helps? HH PS... buy the Napoleon!!!!!!! And here's yet another reason why... My bother bought an entry level Napoleon about 15 years ago... came with a 20 year warrantee on the burners. About Five years ago, he noticed some flamage coming from one of the burners. He called Napoloen, decribed his problem and they told him they would take care of him. So, not so long afterwards, he came home from work and found that his BBQ had been moved, curiously, he removed the cover only to find that a repair man had arrived, changed out the burners and completely cleaned the BBQ, NO CHARGE!
