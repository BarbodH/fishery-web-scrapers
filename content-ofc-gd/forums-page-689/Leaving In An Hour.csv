Unfished and teeming with big wild brookies.  I'm leaving in about an hour for the long trek north. It's been about 6 years since I've been, so to say I'm stoked is an understatement.  C'mon 6 O'Clock!!!"
462992,Paully,2010-05-04 20:56:00,712,Good luck Solo.. Take lots of pics

462994,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2010-05-04 20:59:00,0,looking forward to an epic report upon your return.  the brookies have been biting.
462995,Terry,2010-05-04 20:59:00,14456,I think they cut a logging road to that lake 3 years ago and it's fished out...    oh wait that was what happened to my secret lake....  good luck

462997,solopaddler,2010-05-04 21:04:00,8605, Thanks boys!  Actually Terry they did cut a road to within 1500m of the lake.  Bill's joining and bringing the ATV so we'll see how she goes.
463000,walleyejigger,2010-05-04 21:08:00,876,"good luck  ummmm.. what color vehicle do u have an when will u be passing by, just curious, not gonna follow you or anything  hope you have a great time"
463003,solopaddler,2010-05-04 21:17:00,8605, Ironically we are passing through Chelmsford.  Billy is insisting on taking the Sultan Rd across to 101 to save time. It's definitely not my choice. Over the years I've blown tires on 4 separate occasions on that road.
463006,Roy,2010-05-04 21:26:00,13728,"Have a good trip Mike. Stay safe. Oh, you might want to say your final goodbye to scuro2 now.  Looking forward to your report."
