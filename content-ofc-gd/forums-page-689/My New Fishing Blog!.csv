My target market is the cottager coming up for the weekend, to try and get them out fishing more often. For those of you that fish the Kawartha lakes, check it out. I'll be posting up-to-date fishing reports, tournament results and lake conditions with pictures and video. I plan to update it weekly or even bi-weekly as the fishing season heats up. Any tips or advice shoot me an email. Hope you enjoy it.  http://www.mykawartha.com/blog/809885"
