462444,davew3,2010-05-03 14:39:00,430,Well made it up to the trailer.  Except for one storm that went through Sat afternoon it was perfect on Big Bay. At our camp the winner was 7.2 lb.  Just a bit bigger then mine at 6.8.  Lots of fish caught.  The three of us had our limit by 8 pm Sat.  We were lucky as I was able to launch my boat at the camp. I hear Deseronto was one busy place.  Three more weeks until I can get back up there for a 5 day strech.  Tightlines all.
462600,Cosmos,2010-05-03 20:37:00,588," I was fishing Saturday morning at Big bay as well. I didn't get any walleye. Got some pikes and basses, but no walleye at all. i was using deep diving rapalas, some heavy spinners.  What you were using?"

462609,davew3,2010-05-03 20:56:00,430,"Well we were using erie dearies in deep water,trolling at 1.8 mph. At one point I counted 41 boats around the marker. We never went close, I preferred to stay away from the crowd as we were trolling with about 125 yards of line out.  About a third of our spools.  Regards"
462651,fishhunter,2010-05-03 22:38:00,604,Good to see you did well too. fish were on the feed big time both days.
462724,Stoty,2010-05-04 01:36:00,2910,"Yes, they are feeding pretty well right now, but seem to mostly be tiny ones (below 3 lbs). However, I did have the 4th place fish for a while (10.15lbs), but it didn't make it, so it was disqualified because its a ""live release"" tournament."
462740,fishhunter,2010-05-04 01:52:00,604,we hit lots in the 3-6 lb and a couple 7/8lb and a 11.1 to finish off the weekend
462859,Cosmos,2010-05-04 14:12:00,588,Can you guys give me a couple of good advises?  Looks like canadian walleye is more picky than his russian brother. I got them only accidentally i would say. All my trips to target only walleye finished unsuccessfully. Can you share some technique and your most popular lures?  Thank you
462888,cityfisher,2010-05-04 15:38:00,959,"the whole area was busy till about 4pm sat afternoon... very few boats around after that, at least where we were fising. no bigs in our group (4 guys-2 boats), couple 28 inchers were the biggest we got ... we did get 6-8 keepers for the fry on both days which was nice."
