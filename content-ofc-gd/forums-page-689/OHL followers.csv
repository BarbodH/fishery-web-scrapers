463131,Governator,2010-05-05 02:16:00,879,"Our local Rogers was playing BINGO instead of the game lol  However, I did a browse the guide and looked up OHL and there she was.  It was playing on a Rogers Sportspak channel in the 400s.  Terrible commentary though.  Congrats to spitfire, they deserved the repeat."
463303,Swan_Dive,2010-05-05 20:30:00,46,"How about the no handshake at the end of the game for the coaches?  I didn't get to keep that good of tabs on the series but I did see the hit on the goalie, but was there more that went on that would cause the windsor coach not to shake marty's hand?"
463339,muskeybugged,2010-05-05 22:34:00,282," I did that trip for last years OHL final Game 5 only to see my Battalion lose in 5 games (One game better then Barrie did!)...Man do them Windsor fans and team managment/P.R. know how to put on a good product from the pregame tailgate to the game opening light show - maybe the pops on the bus ride down enhanced everything but it was a great time to be had  .  Congrates again Windsor, very respectful fans also!  Barrie's lack of adversity in getting to the final, I think did them in.  Before they knew it they were down 3-0 and in a spot they were not used to.  That's the first I heard of the no handshake... Not good or the ""Canadian way"" no matter the excuse."
463374,misfish,2010-05-06 00:02:00,29133," It must be a ,GENTELMEN THING,right John   That was total crap."
463377,JohnF,2010-05-06 00:13:00,3494," I gotta admit that there were times when I was coaching minor ball & hockey that it took all the restraint I had to just reach out and shake some ""adults"" hands after games. I'd have rather spit on a few of them. There were a few interactions that I wasn't real proud of afterwards but I tried not to let them happen around the kids.  JF"
463379,Rizzo,2010-05-06 00:14:00,4754," I'm not a fan of OHL hockey and could care less about the colts, but I think you're missing the point here. My understanding is that Windsor passed him by in the first round (understandable as he supposed to be a 2nd rounder)but then also traded down after that!!!To me that's being greedy. Trading your 2nd rounder for some other assets, knowing that everyone will leave him alone, and you'll get your own son at a bargain (lower pick than he should have been). If this is what happened, I commend the colts for taking a stand and selecting this kid. The windsor GM was abusing the ""gentleman's agreement"" by trading down his 2nd pick. Forgive me if I'm wrong (as I said I'm not a fan) but if he did trade down his 2nd pick somebody had to make a point and draft the kid, just happened to be Barrie."
463383,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2010-05-06 00:21:00,0,windsor has abused the last 2 or 3 drafts... serves them right!
463386,JohnF,2010-05-06 00:29:00,3494, You're right. I don't really follow Major JR any more so I missed that detail. But there's enough other bush league stuff going on that they should all be a little embarrassed. I had my fill of hockey politics years ago when Barrie was still Tier II. I don't even know when the leaque changed.  JF
463388,misfish,2010-05-06 00:35:00,29133," When the final whistle goes,the game is over.(man was that so hard to tell the kids even my own)No matter what happen before,as a coach(and I was one aswell for many years) the game is over. I can understand your input John,but it,s in good nature to just shake and go on your way."
463393,misfish,2010-05-06 00:40:00,29133," I still remember taking my son to a game in the old Dunlop barn. They were playing Orrilla.This guy came from no where, and dove into the box to fight one of the players.I would like to say he was a fan,but just a Just crazy goon..  Hey,how about them Bruins.  The series is over so if you like mods.feel free to lock this on out.  CONGRATS WINDSOR AND BEST OF LUCK."
463397,JohnF,2010-05-06 00:55:00,3494," You're right, and I was usually pretty good at it, but when adults started getting into it physically with the kids I got mad. I remember one night I stood back to back with the referee (a cop in his day job) trying to protect my 10 year old players from a handful of fathers who didn't like the fact that we won. The game had gotten pretty rough for a game that was supposed to have no hitting and my guys didn't start the dirty stuff but they sure finished it. The ref/cop filed a report about it that supported my team all the way and he was from the same town as the losers and we were playing in their rink. Then there were the handshakes were the coaches apologized to each other for their parents behaviour. I won't name any cities but there were a few minor organizations that weren't noted for classy behaviour in those days. We've had bus tires slashed and players beaten up in the parking lot. I even had one of my own player parents come up behind me and sucker punch me for benching his kid. That was a class act. But hey, isn't that what minor sports is supposed to be about?  I'm sure every guy who ever coached has tons of stupid war stories.  JF"
463400,misfish,2010-05-06 01:02:00,29133," Dont get me started,  Thanks John for the replies to this thread and all others that did.         It,s a game.Yes we can get carried away,but the bottom line is,,,,,,,,       IT,S A GAME."
460699,muskeybugged,2010-04-28 02:23:00,282, Rogers cable channel don't work to well on Express Vu though
462194,Krisco,2010-05-02 23:35:00,67," Hey Brian,,,, What was that you said?????  I have bitten my tongue on this one for 2 weeks. Your Colts are the most overated team I have every seen. They  were ranked #1 in the CHL playing in the weakest conference. Not much of a challenge all year. They had Mississauga as their only competition, doesn't matter  who they had played, they would have had their hands full with Kitchener, London, Plymouth or maybe even the Sault. I believe that the media truely had people believe that they were the real thing which was very misleading. On today's broadcast they talked about how Barrie won both meetings with Windsor but failed to mention that Windsor had 6 players missing at the World Jr's and were playing with 5 Jr B players in their line up.  I'm not saying the series is over as we know what happened in the Kitchener vs Windsor series. If the Colts can win game 4 they will be on their way and heading home for game #5 and anything can happen.  The hit on the goalie at the end was pure frustration on Barrie's part and was brutal. Should make for an interesting game 4.  Anything can happen and lets see how the cards fall."
462206,misfish,2010-05-02 23:56:00,29133,"Yeah I kinda blew my load earlly didnt I.  They are looking bad and Im frustrated. As for the hit on the goalie.He was playing the puck,fair game,but not called for.  4 straight .lets see."
462209,Krisco,2010-05-03 00:00:00,67," All in good fun I know, but it can be done lets see how it plays out."
462214,misfish,2010-05-03 00:10:00,29133," Win Tuesday,back to Barrie."
462215,JohnF,2010-05-03 00:10:00,3494, Like drafting the Windsor GM's kid out of midget in the first round - fair game but against their gentleman's agreement. The Barrie organization is showing themselves as a cheap shot organization from the back office out to the ice. I suspect their silliness is a bit embarrassing for a lot of you fans.  JF
462226,misfish,2010-05-03 00:23:00,29133,"Yes john.it is embarrassing.  Next game should be exciting,win or lose.Lets hope it,s not too embarrassing."
462231,Scott S,2010-05-03 00:35:00,203,"All the kid's drafted are in midget. If Windsor wanted him so bad why didn't they pick him first. What they thought that everyone would let go untill there pick again. He's fair game, maybe not a first rounder but Barrie was the last pick of the first round. My two cent's Go Colts Go Scooter"
462277,JohnF,2010-05-03 01:53:00,3494, If there were no rules the OHL would be drafting Minor Atoms. The scouts said he wasn't a first rounder. But the point is that it's a gentleman's agreement. Does that mean Barrie's exempt?  JF
462376,muskeybugged,2010-05-03 11:52:00,282,I have not counted Barrie out yet...ask Kitchener about a 3-0 lead!
462457,Swan_Dive,2010-05-03 14:58:00,46," It's cutthroat, there is no agreement that means anything unless it is on paper.  What about the american kids that are first rounders but tell all the teams they are going to go to school and then a team like london picks them up as a sleeper in the 3-4 round.  If a kid is still on the board and no one has taken him he is fair game, maybe he wasn't a first rounder but maybe they didn't think anyone else had as much potential as he did.  Barrie has made some question trades and draft picks in the past few years and it happens, but since the owner ship change it has been happening alot more.  The organization has changed from what it used to be when Jamie Massie was running things.  Hopefully the colts can come back and atleast make it a series but the way the last couple games have gone I don't think they will be able to.  Good for the kids on making it this far though, it is never easy no matter what conference your in to make it to the finals  Go Colts"
462467,Governator,2010-05-03 15:11:00,879," Are you serious?  That's bold statement to say, why because they are down 3-0 in a series?  They lost the first 2 by 1 goal, which really could've gone either way.  Infact I'd go as far as saying they would've come out with a win last night if it wasn't for Grubauer having the game of his career.  He was the only reason this game wasn't a different outcome.  They peppered windsor for 44 shots and had dozens of scoring chances (many premium).  I will say however that it was sad to see the emotions get out of control at the end.   Archibald's clown hit made me want to punch him out.  I was happy to see Grubauer laugh it off, he seems like a good guy."
462653,steelhead hunter,2010-05-03 22:45:00,152,the only reason they are making a big deal out of the draft is because it was barrie that took him if it were anyone else you wouldn't even know no one said a word when kitchener took Maxwell and his dad is a strom coach and division rivals
462656,steelhead hunter,2010-05-03 22:51:00,152,just found out that Archibald Wallice and Renaldo all got susspened indefenitly after sundays game Archibald got charging the goalie Wallice for the Kennedy hit and shots after and Renaldo for an altercation with an official and both Barrie and Windsor were fined $5000 each for off ice incidents
462793,misfish,2010-05-04 10:20:00,29133," I would like to know what he told his son,after he passed him by in the draft.??????????????? Like mentioned,if it were another team,we wouldnt be talking about it. It,s hard on a player when your team mates know your ol mans the coach.Im sure alot of us know that.    I cant say Im surprised SH.They interviewed a few Barrie fans that were there.Sounds like it got way out of hand.  GO COLTS"
462829,JohnF,2010-05-04 13:08:00,3494," He probably said something like ""It would look bad if we took you in the first round. They'd say it was only because you're the GM's kid. We'll keep our fingers crossed that the other GM's take the high road and let us take you in the second round where you're ranked."" That's the problem with gentlemens' agreements. They only work with gentlemen.  You're right about family getting involved in sports. It's tough for the coaches and the kid when family is involved. I've been there. My own son lost on both fronts. I had to be tougher with him than the other kids and he still took a lot of abuse for being the coach's kid. He got so frustrated with the second class treatment that he quit hockey after bantam and went to play house league. The funny part was that once he was playing house league there was a scout for a top Jr B team doing his damnedest to recruit him but he'd had enuf of hockey politics by then and was concentrating on his first love, volleyball. It wasn't as high profile but he said he had a lot more fun.  JF"
462866,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2010-05-04 14:31:00,0,"i'm glad someone said something about the ohl's drafting tactics.  for years the spitfires have been picking up guys that scared other teams off by stating their intentions to play in the ncaa, then they scoop them up...and it's not always in the 3rd or 4th round.  cam fowler is a pretty good example.  there was just an article about this in our local newspaper the other day.  good thing branch loves windsor!"
463040,misfish,2010-05-04 23:16:00,29133,Once again have to listen to the game online.  1-0 BARRIE.  Grubour is at it again though.

463091,misfish,2010-05-05 01:09:00,29133,5-2 now.Im going to watch the end of the habs game.  GO HABS.
463093,JohnF,2010-05-05 01:10:00,3494, Other than the possibility of a league requested blackout I'd say something about how typically Rogers that is to carry it in Stratford but not in Barrie. As for the blackout I doubt many fans would feel compelled to make the trip to Windsor because they couldn't get it on tv.  JF
458281,misfish,2010-04-20 22:56:00,29133,"All the pros that are in the know,have picked Barrie and Windsor to meet in the finals.Barrie is up 3-1 against Mississaga(as expected) but the Kitchener Rangers are spanking Windsor.All that talent Windsor has , thier on thier way out,down 3-0.  Ya think they(the rangers) want a piece of Park? Park,for those that dont know,was Kitcheners goalie that we picked up in a trade.Great one if you ask me.  PLAYOFFS one just never knows."
458288,jediangler,2010-04-20 23:23:00,1923,Being from Kitchener maybe I'm a bit biased but a team will beat a superstar or two anyday. Spott has the boys playing like a real team and Skinner's draft ranking is rising higher every game. Go Rangers Go.
458334,jediangler,2010-04-21 01:36:00,1923,Windsor just won game #4 by a score of 7-5 to stay alive and avoid being swept. The Spits went into the 3rd leading 4-1 before a combined 7 goal outburst from both teams to make for an exciting period. Rangers now lead the series 3 games to 1. Back to Windsor for game 5.
458344,kickingfrog,2010-04-21 02:07:00,8333,"That's right, let's get both of those teams good and tired.  Great hockey, entertaining, affordable and I don't have to spend an 2-3 hours in the car getting to the game and back."

458778,muskeybugged,2010-04-22 17:04:00,282,"Windsor I think expected to coast into the final....Mem Cup champs, not much change from last years team..... A little over cocky maybe.  That being said Kitchener has dug themselves a hole not closing it out in 4. Being a huge Battalion Fan and watching Barrie easily handle Brampton and then Mississauga I don't think Windsor has a chance beating Barrie if they ever do get past Kitchener....."
458829,misfish,2010-04-22 20:32:00,29133," Barrie seems to be able to pour in on when needed.Last nights 3 goal lead that shrunk to 1 showed that.Another quick goal and great defence. They also have 3 goalies not two,that can play on any given day.  When they get to the memorial cup,that will be the real test IMO.   Yes I said ,when."
