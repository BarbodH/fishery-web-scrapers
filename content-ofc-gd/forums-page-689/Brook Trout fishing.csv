462598,Dutchy,2010-05-03 20:21:00,416,"I was invited to go brook trout fishing with JJcanoe (John) and some of his friends. Its an annual pilgrimage for them and my first attempt. We were fishing somewhere north of London, but south of Baffin Island. Hopefully that is not too specific   I have wanted to fish for brook trout for a couple of years and was assured I would get into some fish. They were not wrong. I will say up front that I caught nowhere near as many as John and his friends, but I did a respectable job I think for my first attempt. These fish hold in some weird places in the river.  Friday: We fished a small pool and there was ALOT of chub around and some big ones (Over 12 inches). Eventually I hook a brookie, my first ever, around 9 inches:   Keep fishing and hook a small brookie in the same pool:   John went wandering off and came back to announce he caught 17 fish including two 14 inch brookies. He has the pics of these ones which he is going to post later.  Saturday: Start fishing around a bridge and first drift I hook a 10 inch brookie. (John has pic of this one) We wander off to where John had been fishing on friday, hooking brookies all the way up:      It was a fantastic day, I caught 6, John about 25. Experience definitely seems to come into this, but I was still happy that I caught any at all. I lost one really nice fish that was under the bank I was standing on. That was a first for me to have a fish shoot out from basically under your feet. I'll be brookie fishing again, what a way to spend a weekend. Sunday was pretty much a bust, I got one 5 inch brookie, John got 6 or 7. John has a lots more pics, so look for updates.  Doug"

462844,Fish Farmer,2010-05-04 13:39:00,2234,"Nice Brookies makes my mouth water. Fried eggs,home frys,Brook trout and Green Tomato Chow  MMMMMMM Good nothin better than that. Guess I'll just settle for Perch and eggs for Brecky. Pickerels wouldn't be bad either. Thanks for posting, made me hungry."
463129,limeyangler,2010-05-05 02:15:00,5204,"Awesome job, i've tried 3 times now and never landed one."
463139,Dutchy,2010-05-05 02:46:00,416," I take no credit for it. I was with guys who have been brook trout fishing in that particular area for between 20 and 40 years. They told me exactly what to do, where to go and I still caught nowhere near as many as they did. Its not easy to catch them"
