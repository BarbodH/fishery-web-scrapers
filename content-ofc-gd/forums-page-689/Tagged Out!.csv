The other two set up at the bottom of the field and I set up on the top end, about 300 yards away from them. They had 4 birds walk directly behind them, totally ignored their decoys and they didn't even see them until it was too late. I saw the birds and they just started walking my way. It felt like an eternity, but leaning against the tree, I watched them about about 20 yards away...two hens...a jake...and a TOM! YEE HAW....slowly lifted the REM and bang. Nice bird.......with a really big fan.  Done for the year, might go out a couple of times to call and video tape for some guys...time to get my boat ready!  "

462729,GBW,2010-05-04 01:40:00,8460,"I don't hunt but never knew there was 3 diff sex of these birds.  Male, female and IT.  Huh, who knew?"
462736,misfish,2010-05-04 01:48:00,29133,"It is possible to have a hen (female)with a beard,which is legal to shoot.You can not take a hen in the spring(without abeard),but can in the fall hunt.Then theres the jake,a yound male ,which you can shoot.The big tom is the prize hunt."
462739,GBW,2010-05-04 01:51:00,8460,"Wow, I didn't know hunting was about looking for the odd bearded lady!"
