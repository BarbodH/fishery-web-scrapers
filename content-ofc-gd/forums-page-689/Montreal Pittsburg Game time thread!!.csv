463100,tb4me,2010-05-05 01:34:00,3295,wow I cant belive how drab this game has been..2:24 left in the game...
463103,tb4me,2010-05-05 01:38:00,3295,wow shutout! empty netter  yea!!!! not a good play-off game IMO  2-0
463119,MCTFisher9120,2010-05-05 01:56:00,3761, Who read that??   O well at least Montreal shined when they first came out onto the ice
463126,Marty,2010-05-05 02:06:00,873,"Complain all you want about Sid but I guess it's a requirement of admission for 21,000 people to whine in unison as well.   The Habs fans whine for a penalty everytime a Hab hits the ice.  That game wasn't boring to this Pens fan and my guess is Habs' fans feel the same way.  This series is going to be fun for all.  I am getting very tired of watching the Pens dominate the offensive end for 75% of a game and still risk a loss.   This series is a toss-up.  Flower stood on his head and won that game."
463127,scuro2,2010-05-05 02:09:00,904,"What do these numbers mean: 7,3,8?"
463042,tb4me,2010-05-04 23:22:00,3295,Well as the title says. Just checking to see if theres interest in a GTT.Who is gonna win and what are everyones predictions? I want to read scores too folks! What ya all think?
463043,irishfield,2010-05-04 23:23:00,26272,Montreal 4 to 3
463044,lookinforwalleye,2010-05-04 23:24:00,4399,4-2 Habs
463045,GBW,2010-05-04 23:25:00,8460,3 - 2 for Montreal
463050,tb4me,2010-05-04 23:46:00,3295,wow lots of belivers on here.. I will be the different one. 4- 3 pitts in OT
463051,tb4me,2010-05-04 23:47:00,3295,camaralli just blew it big time wow
463052,danbouck,2010-05-04 23:48:00,4380,Pittsburgh 27-1
463053,Dutchy,2010-05-04 23:50:00,416,Pittsburgh look totally uninterested in the game IMO
463055,tb4me,2010-05-04 23:51:00,3295,well after the 1st period id say Montreals game plan is to take it to fleury hard. Funny how washington couldnt do that in the first round...I say the pens get the first goal of the game early in the 2nd per
463062,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2010-05-05 00:07:00,0,3-1 pitts.
463063,MCTFisher9120,2010-05-05 00:08:00,3761,Pittsburgh wins...simple as that
463065,tb4me,2010-05-05 00:12:00,3295,"i would normally agree with the above statment however pitts looks flat on thier feet.I dont get it, go to the net hard boys and quit turnin it over in the neutral zone, geez"
463067,GBW,2010-05-05 00:14:00,8460,"not me, it just looks like the Habs have wanted it more every time they step on the ice."
463068,Dutchy,2010-05-05 00:15:00,416,Crosby needs to pull out a gem to get Pitt going.
463071,misfish,2010-05-05 00:33:00,29133,2-1 habs.
463077,lookinforwalleye,2010-05-05 00:44:00,4399, it`s hockey not football!!!
463078,Mattones,2010-05-05 00:47:00,587,Not much of a fan of either teams but is it me or is Sidney diving like crazy! I am hoping someone on the Canadians tunes him in for it.
463079,GBW,2010-05-05 00:49:00,8460,I hope a few guys can't play the 3rd cause of that stuff after the period was over (because the ref's can do that)...
463081,tb4me,2010-05-05 00:50:00,3295,They wont...not in the playoffs. You may see some 4 on 4 thats about it
463082,yakpiker,2010-05-05 00:51:00,160, not likely...that was pretty mild  Malkin making the smurf's head disappear was one sided and a little funny
463083,tb4me,2010-05-05 00:52:00,3295,ya that was funny..
463086,GBW,2010-05-05 00:54:00,8460,I know they will never sit guys at this time of year for it but it would be nice to teach them a lesson that they are not above the law's of the game.  The KID sure thinks he is...  The next Tiger?  AHHH HAHAHAHAHAHA
463087,Dutchy,2010-05-05 00:57:00,416," Malkin is a big guy, he was just swatting at Gionta like don't bother me.  :rofl2:"
463088,Slop,2010-05-05 01:03:00,151,Staying outta the box would'nt hurt...hope the home team keeps this from going extra frames.\GO BLUE BLANC ROUGE!!!!!
463090,JohnF,2010-05-05 01:04:00,3494,I really enjoy watching Sid play but I gotta wonder how many get outa jail free does he get for being Sid. He's hacking and diving like a 4th liner.  JF
