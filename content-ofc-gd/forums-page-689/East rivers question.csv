462932,Paully,2010-05-04 18:04:00,712,Are bottoms of dam areas off limits to fishing?  I've been to a few that say no fishin 25 meters down stream ext. But some don't say it... is that cause somebody tore down the sign for his own benefit?
462939,Mykester,2010-05-04 18:21:00,241,"Regs say all dams, so I'd follow the rule everywhere. Also I have my own question, how far at the top of the dam are you allowed to fish, because regs say downstream."
462950,Paully,2010-05-04 18:50:00,712,"All i could find in the regulations is Pg. 8 - fish within 22.9 m (75 ft.) down stream from the lower entrance to any fish way or canal, obstacle, or any device designed to assist fish around an obstacle.  Does this also mean dams without fishways? is a dam a obstacle? how about a beaver dam? im confused  What if its a natural waterfall that the fish cant get up.. obstacle?"
462956,dakota,2010-05-04 19:10:00,7,The way i would read that is any man made obstruction. Rob
