463150,jat,2010-05-05 03:58:00,138,Is there anywhere in the GTA or close to it that I can actually try on a good pair of fishing glasses that are reasonably priced? Any good online places for glasses? Thanks
463159,fish_fishburn,2010-05-05 09:42:00,1311,I saw lots at CT on the weekend. Not sure what brand they were but they were around 25.00. For better quality and more expensive go to pretty well any eyeglass store.
