461944,Leecher,2010-05-01 21:54:00,7832,"I've been looking forward to this weekend anxiously for another go at the square tails..... all week been thinking about what I could of done differently in my presentation to increase my chance of hooking a few more   ............fast forward to this morning  Got on the road at 5:45am, temps was at 11C, overcast and no wind..... PERFECT!!!  Had a good feeling about it  Got to destination at 7:15am and quickly setup one of my rods with a walleye slip bobber type rig and dew worm.  Target was bottom for the beginning.... Here's a view of what I was seeing while waiting    Real calm and peaceful Some time past before I decided to try and setup my second rod with a mini Big O perch pattern.... and this after seeing a couple of fish break surface on the calm top..... so I pulled my first line in and started to cast my second setup..... first cast and FISH ON Now I don't know about you bow guys but this fish was going insane on me     It cleared surface 3 times before I was able to land it  It's not the biggest but to me and this lake I fish in, sure is a decent one..... here's the pic of my first rainbow trout ever.... and I don't look that happy at all about it    16 1/4"" long    I was pumped to the fullest after that and couldn't care less if I caught another     It wouldn't fit flat in my cooler     but I managed  I tried casting the Mepps black furry #2 and did not get a sniff so I went back to my dewie rig setup but it also did not get any hits  I did after that, walk the shoreline with the mini Big O setup but alas it was not meant to be  Here's my PB and first bow ever..... along side the measuring tape and the tool used    Again the mini Big O    At 12:45pm called it a day and got home around 2:15pm..... Nothing found in the stomach..... was just running dry  I've also created a video for those that can view it  <embed width=""600"" height=""361"" type=""application/x-shockwave-flash"" allowFullscreen=""true"" allowNetworking=""all"" wmode=""transparent"" src=""http://static.photobucket.com/player.swf?file=http://vid732.photobucket.com/albums/ww321/leechman1/2010/Trout%20May01%202010/SpeckleMay01st2010.flv"">  Enjoy!!!

461946,Fishing 24/7,2010-05-01 22:10:00,709,   you are now know as the bow master!
461948,Leecher,2010-05-01 22:16:00,7832,Thanks Kev!!!  She was a blast to land.... that's for sure Ohhhhh you're too kind
461968,bigugli,2010-05-01 23:44:00,6138,"Well done Jacques. Trial and error til you find what works. Even with only one in the box, I'm sure it was worth the adventure."
461971,misfish,2010-05-02 00:01:00,29133,WTG Jacques.  Did you stop by the peeler bar to record that song?
461976,Guest Johnny Bass,2010-05-02 00:33:00,0,Congrats on your first bow. Its always a great feeling to catch a new species. Thanks for the vid too.
462025,The Urban Fisherman,2010-05-02 03:48:00,2050,"Right on Jaques!  This is the best time of year to fish them bows... the first couple of weeks after opener you can still get them on crank baits and other shallow presentations. My local lake is full of those 15 to 17 inchers.... Mostly stocked fish though, with a mix of natural browns in there.  Thanks for the report and keep at it!  I haven't made it out yet this year, but maybe next weekend!  Cheers, Ryan"
462043,Cudz,2010-05-02 12:44:00,2652,very cool

No LOL  Had to fiddle with it until it was perfectly synchronized with the pics being displayed   Thanks Johnny Bass!!!  I knew there was bows in this lake and it totally caught me by surprise   Thanks Ryan!!!  I know that QMNR stocked this lake with bows at some point in time....  and this one might be native cause I did not see any fins clipped....  I will definitely keep at it.... next time around will be throwing spinners & cranks at them more often   Thanks Chris!!!   Thanks Mike!!!  It sure is   Thanks Shaynebow!!!  I like the new handle  LOL  I'm definitely hooked..... man those bows sure put up a great fight   Thanks Mike!!!  I can't get over the fight they put up
462238,carll2,2010-05-03 00:56:00,443,"awesome bow, especially for quebec(quite rare) ....heres how my day turned out, between 3 guys we caught 40 brookies between 10-18 inches, we kept 22 smaller ones and put the rest back that werent bleeding(btw for people who will count the fish our limit is 10 specks each in quebec) believe it or not all the fish have been eaten already, we had a big bbq last night with friends and family!! keep them reports coming    "
462242,Leecher,2010-05-03 01:05:00,7832, Thanks Carl!!!  Sounds like you had a blast and the square tails were on the feed     Congrats mon ami May I ask what lures (live or artificial) your were using to get them to commit???
462256,carll2,2010-05-03 01:24:00,443,"  silver blue williams wobbler and mepps black spinner with fur on the tail and bobit spinners(all tipped with worms) ....trolled very very slow on wind blown rock shoals, surface water was 6 degreees  if you ever make your way down here il be glad to show you lake x"
462262,Leecher,2010-05-03 01:35:00,7832," Awesome Carl     When you say Mepps black spinner, you mean black furry dressed #2 right??   Yes those are killer for specks It would be an honor to join you on lake x"
462272,Mike the Pike,2010-05-03 01:48:00,3421,Another banner report mom ami!!!!!!!!!!!Must be nice to be an IT tec.Lots of puter skills.Good to hear you caught an acrobat because I had my worst BOQ opener ever the big skunkaroo.C'est l'ouveture de brochet en fin de semaine.lac Champlain Venice en Quebec .Hurry up Saturday.
462284,Leecher,2010-05-03 02:02:00,7832," Merci mon ami Mike!!!  Yes them IT skills come in very handy LOL Sorry to hear that ""pépé le pew"" was predominant at the opener but I think time spent on the water is the greatest.... hooking onto fish is bonus  Si tu viens dans le coin autour du 10 mai..... la nouvelle lune est le 13 mai.... je book une journée off entre le 10 et 12 (reste à determinée) pour une partie de queue carré au petit lac que j'ai prit cette mervelleuse arc-en-ciel....  Speckies should be on the feed.... so your welcome my friend!!! Jacques"
462314,corvette1,2010-05-03 02:36:00,1765,congrats leech 3 jumps awesome
462319,Leecher,2010-05-03 02:50:00,7832,"Thanks Corvy!!!  Yes at first I thought I had a small mouth bass    As soon as there was tension, BANG she was out of the water Instead of lowering the rod tip so to avoid the jumps.... just enjoyed the great acrobatics Those bows sure put up a great fight   Love it!!!"
462408,carll2,2010-05-03 13:40:00,443,  exactly black fury with yellow dots
462623,Leecher,2010-05-03 21:19:00,7832, Yep..... that's the one     Killer for specks
462693,Spiel,2010-05-04 00:41:00,9065,"Wow, first rainbow Jacques, late bloomer I says.  Want to buy a custom 15' rainbow rod......"
462748,MJL,2010-05-04 02:10:00,2427,Congrats Jacques  That fish reminds me a lot of those trout I see at the grocery store...They look tasty.LOL  The mini big-O is one of my favourite lures for steelhead and browns too...I painted a few in the classic kwik-fish 'skunk' pattern with silver flakes.
462855,Leecher,2010-05-04 14:04:00,7832, Thanks Chris!!!  She sure put up a great fight.... caught me by surprise  Wanna trade   Thanks Mike!!!  First time trying the Big O this year.... great lure  for sure.  Next time out will be using it and the Black furry spinner a lot more.... seems to trigger a reaction.... I'm thinking that the trout are getting active on the hatching black flies now.  Lots of them out
