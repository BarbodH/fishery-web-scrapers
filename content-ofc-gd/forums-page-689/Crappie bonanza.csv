462909,crappieperchhunter,2010-05-04 16:57:00,2582,Well done Bruce. Looks like the sink in your new place is going to see just as many fish as your last residence.  Thx for sharing and enjoy the fish fry.

463155,bigugli,2010-05-05 04:23:00,6138,I got coaxed into having another kick at the can tonight. I just can't turn down such temptations.   
463348,rockfish,2010-05-05 23:02:00,91,"Rob never looks too happy, even when he's got fish.   He should take some pointers from his old man and the avatar and smile once in a while."
