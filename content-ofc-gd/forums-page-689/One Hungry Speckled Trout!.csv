461942,danc,2010-05-01 21:49:00,4677,"When Brookies decide to eat, they can really gorge themselves. I've only cleaned a few in the past decade but I remember cleaning an 18"" fish once that had 28 minnows in it's stomach, mostly Sticklebacks. It hit a Rapala. A friend once caught one with 13 Smelts in it's belly. Just incredible!!"
461945,highdrifter,2010-05-01 22:04:00,2534,Wow that's some phat trout!!

461952,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2010-05-01 22:31:00,0,a lady friend of mine once caught a 3 pound speck with 24 assorted size crayfish in it's mouth and belly.  i've also seen mayfly hatches where the fish were regurgitating balls of hexagenia's all over the place.
461960,TC1OZ,2010-05-01 23:01:00,987,awesome fish!!!
461965,camillj,2010-05-01 23:32:00,1988,pretty fish !
461969,Dozer,2010-05-01 23:45:00,896,You ruined its day!
461979,SRT8 smoker craft,2010-05-02 00:44:00,1107,Chunker for sure !!!  Me and that fish are alot alike but it's potato chips for me.
461980,Guest Johnny Bass,2010-05-02 00:45:00,0,That's really cool. That trout sure has a healthy appetite!
463005,troutboy,2010-05-04 21:26:00,125,"The brookies up north here are still deep and not eating,waters still freezing.Another week and the big boys will be in the shallows feedin' up a storm.Only caught one brookie this year,a chunky four pounder with a perch half way swallowed!"
463007,solopaddler,2010-05-04 21:31:00,8605,  I'll say.  I once caught a spec with 3 frogs and a baby mouse in it's stomach.  You know that scene in Jaws where they slit open the sharks belly and all kinds of weird crap spills out including a license plate?  That's what it was like when I put the knife to it.  They definitely strap on the feed bag now and again.
463114,limeyangler,2010-05-05 01:51:00,5204,Wow...gluttony right there.  i'd have a minnow trap in there like a shot! ( if its legal there of course  )
