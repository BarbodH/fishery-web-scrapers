If you haven't seen it, it's a top ten count down of various types of food in the US - for example Best Sandwiches, etc...  I learned a couple of things while watching this show:  1) you can never be too full lol....makes me hungry watching this show 2) what are our friends to the south thinking - i mean who needs a sandwich that is 2 grilled cheese sandwiches, 1 pound hamburger patty, cheese, lettuce, tomato, bacon, deep fried onions and 3000 calories?????? 3) no longer wondering why everyone that i see in an american timmies, dunkin donut or dennys is so large lol  but i think i'm going to try to make a mother in law:  tamale, onions, jalapenoes, relish, pickles and served on a large hotdog bun"
