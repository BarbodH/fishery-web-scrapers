So OFC members, let's support them by buying one for the kids! THE NEW BOWROD WILL CHANGE YOUR FISHING!!    https://www.spindirect.com/product_order.php?productid=16935&s=bowrod_can&refurl=bowrod.ca  All joking aside, I really wonder how these people do it. Are there actually a whole bunch of people out there that really buy this junk?!"
462634,Roy,2010-05-03 21:48:00,13728,"Well if they at least took the trigger off you could set it over your shoulder and get a money shot a la Solopaddler.  Sorry Mike, it was stronger'n dirt."
462650,solopaddler,2010-05-03 22:37:00,8605, Sure why not? Get bow rod to send me one and I'll pimp it for them.

Are there actually a whole bunch of people out there that really buy this junk?!  well, the answer is yes...... my wife and i run a kids fishing tournament every year. last year we had 5 of them donated and they went fast, as the kids get to pick there own prize.  how many people bought the ""PET ROCK"" ? stupid as it may be the guy that created the pet rock is still eating steak & caviar for breakfast...LOL"

462965,tb4me,2010-05-04 19:47:00,3295,It must sell.. My daughter seen on on tv and now wants one!!!
462999,SRT8 smoker craft,2010-05-04 21:06:00,1107,I bought a rocket rod for my little guy and believe it or not it works quite well and I caught a 2lb LMB on it last year but you have to change the line that comes on it and if you get board you can cut the line and just fire the bobbers at your fishing buddy
