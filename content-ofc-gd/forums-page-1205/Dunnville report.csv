There was lots of people fishing down thier. We got there around 4pm on Saturday and the action was none stop, but the only problem was the catfish and sheephead would be on the other end of the line. I don't know how the walleye are supose to feed when those dam sheephead and catfish  smash everything before you can even put your rod down.  Brother in law with a couple catfish.    Night rolled around and we thought the wallys would start biting but yet again more catfish and sheephead. Then my brother in law is reeling in what he thought was a sheephead and it turn out to be the first and only eye of the day.     Sunday rolled around and they were calling for rain so we went down again thinking there was going to be no people because of the rain. We get there it was overcast and lots of people again. More of the same action as Saturday. Although we saw alot of people catching walleye of the top of the bridge. And a guy beside me caught a couple walleye on shrimp!! It started to get real dark and we could see the dark clouds coming off Erie and it looked like they were heading our way. So I changed my jig coulor upand gave it a few more casts looking for that big wally and hook into something but not big. Turned out to be the only walleye of the day as well. Turned out to be a pretty fun weekend even tho we caught the crap fish and small walleye, all fish were released to swim another day. Thanks for reading my report. Here's a few more pics    One of my bigger sheephead   Small eye "
