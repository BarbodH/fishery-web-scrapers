I brought the ipod and a radio.  We debated over if playing music would spook the fish or not.  The results were:  Fished for one hour and 45min with no music on and caught nothing, fished the last 15 min with the music on (not very loud) and we caught a 5lbs and 3lbs pike.  I know this is just coincidence but who fishes with music on and who fishes with out.  Does the music spook the fish?      However I have to admit it was nice to have some music on the boat, I just wish I could remember what was playing when we hooked into these fish, all fish were released so we could serenade them again.  Have a good one"
