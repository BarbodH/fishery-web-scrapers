78350,Big Cliff,2007-06-02 02:45:00,6899,"I just wanted to thank Tom and Greg both of which took some time to give me some pointers on producing walleye in the Kawarthas.  Now, I've been fishing since I was old enough to hold a rod (a lot of years) and when I lived up in French River, I could get walleye almost any time of the year and under almost any conditions but when I moved to the Kawarthas 5 years ago I brought my old tactics with me. Now don't get me wrong, I have probably caught more than my fair share of walleye in the last 5 years but only when the conditions were right for my style of fishing. I knew I was missing something after seeing reports from Greg and Tom and their results and I was having limited success.  Both of them have very kindly given me some excellent information and advice and tonight I decided to try putting some of it into practice. I'm pleased to say I put a couple of nice walleye into the boat. None of them were 6lb fish but they were nice size fish anyway. Guess it just goes to prove ""you can teach an old dog new tricks"".  Thanks guys!"
