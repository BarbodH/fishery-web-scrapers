I finally remembered reading an article about blind areas within a sonar cone. Took me a while to find the article again - see http://www.vexilar.com/help/tips/tip006.html  The vexilar article provides a plausible explanation of why my colleague could catch keeper walleye (vertically jigging while anchored) without marking any fish on his sonar. Here's a great descriptive picture from the vexilar article:   The vexilar explanation:  The Dead Zone is the area within the transducers cone of sound that is blind to you.  The wider the beam angle the greater the possible dead zone.  The sonar will mark bottom as the nearest distance it sees.  If you are fishing over a slope it may see the high side of the slope, at the edge of the cone, and mark that as bottom.  The fish that are hanging on the bottom in the center of the cone will be invisible to you because they are actually within the bottom signal on your depth finder."

Fish ID is nothing more than a marketing ploy to help sell the unit. You should always have fish ID turned off to get more detail of the bottom. Was he using bottom zoom?  Always make sure that the sensitivity is turned up just enough so that you have interference on the top of the screen. The transducer should be mounted a foot away from the motor as well.  If anyone is considering getting good sonar then buy a unit that has a minimum of 480 vertical pixels. You will pay more but it will pay off when you locate & catch more fish.
78422,aplumma,2007-06-02 15:40:00,6896,Their are a few things that are a given as far as the way a sonar unit  works  The deeper the water and the wider the cone the larger the area is you are reading.  The further out from the center of the cone the weaker the return signal is.  The return from an object's strength is Dependant on the density of the object.    What you should be thinking when you see a mark on the screen is that mark is the highest point from the signal that is bouncing back to your transducer in the area that the cone is being read. If you have a cone reading a 20 ft radius it is telling you the high spot in that 20 ft circle and no other feature is being returned till the next signal.  The cone that is being read is from the center out to the edge of the radius with the center being read the soonest and the strongest.  The density compared to the water is how strong a signal bounces off the object. A fish has a density slightly more than water. Mud is denser than fish and rocks/sand is one of the densest materials you will read.    Now look at your color sonar  a red return is a very dense return and can be verified as being rocky bottom  while a mud bottom has shifted to blue or yellow. Notice at the top of the screen the reflection the wider the reflection the harder the bottom is. Now you can adjust the gain till the rocky bottom gives you a slight return . Now if you are trolling and looking for a fish that likes rocky bottoms you can see at a glance if you are in mud or weeds because the reflection is not at the top of the page. Remember you need to adjust the gain if you vary the depth more than 10 ft or leave the gain turned up and look at the thickness of the return.  Now look at the color of the returns that are suspended a yellow blue return that is large in mass and has highlights of red are more than likely bait fish because of the density of the school and the shifting of the red spot areas depths. If you see the same thing and the red spots stay the same and the color patterns dint move then you are reading a ball of weeds or if more red than yellow wood structure that is free floating or possible coming straight up from the bottom.  So what does a fish look like color wise is usually blue with a hint of yellow. Since the speed that an object passes thru a cone is what gives the famous arch that some people associate with the size of a fish a slow moving target will look much bigger than it actually is. A good graph to see as you are trolling is a few arches then above them a shifting cloud of yellow and blues with a few arches again below it. Remember you are looking down at the first object the signal strikes so you have found the edge of the predator fish with the arches and the bait scattered by them feeding and then the other side of the fish feeding. By staying over the arches and not over the cloud you will not scatter the bait and still see the fish below.  The best thing you can do is to go out in 10 ft of water clear or not and tap a stick on the bottom you will feel the different bottom contours and textures and  how they relate to your screen. Think of the return as the highest point of the signal sent that means a rock will hide a fish that is in a depression inside of the cones return. So the long answer to your question is  A bottom littered with rubble will often times not show the fish that you are catching that are holding tight to the cover.   Art
