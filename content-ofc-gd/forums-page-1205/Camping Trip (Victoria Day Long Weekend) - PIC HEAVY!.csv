A little bit of fishing ... all on the shore ... just behind our campsite.  Caught a few decent ones ... bass ... all photographed and released.  A lot of bluegills ... all used to make soup.  Beautiful Sunset.   A nice family enjoying a little swim   Terry's 2lb Smallie   Freddy's 12"" Crappie   My 12oz Smallie   My 2lb Bucketmouth (2 shots)    Our Catches ... all cut up and cleaned     Some of our catches ... in the pan ...   In our soup ...   Wrapped by Bacon to go on the grill ...   Our drinks .... 5 cases (Saturday noon till Monday morning) ... plus 2 bottles of Canadian Club and 1 bottle of Chivas (mixed with Green Tea)!   Our fire ...     The Crew! "
78529,Tarzan's Jane,2007-06-03 01:01:00,1183,Good for your crew.  Now I just have one question...why do you fry the fish with the heads still attached?  Do you eat the heads?  I'm being serious...I have never seen that before.
78532,Gerritt,2007-06-03 01:13:00,6129,"awesome pictures brother! I have never seen a bacon rapped fish quite like that! I will haveta give it a shot!! Looks yummie!  Did you not scale your fish prior to frying them whole? and if not were the scales bothersome? I ask because I would like to try it if that is the case.  Chrome Hen I cook my fish with the heads on often, especially with pike there is alot of meat in the head that you just suck out  same goes with pickeral Mmmmm Cheeks!   Again awesome report and pictures! thanks for sharing.  Gerritt."
78538,Jacques,2007-06-03 01:28:00,97,Great report!  Bet that soup was good... never thought of Bluegill soup before.  Mind you I bet anything tasted great after five case of beer and a couple of bottle of whisky!
78541,fishindevil,2007-06-03 01:36:00,6254,"right on guys.....great fishing/camping trip,and you guys sure caught lots of fish thats for sure,great pics as well,thanks for sharing....cheers"
78570,98Fahrenheit,2007-06-03 03:19:00,108,"   The fish were all scaled and then cut open to remove the gills and internal organs.  Then cleaned with salt by rubbing the salt on the fish ... to get rid of the dirt on the skin and fins.  All the bluegills were fried slightly and then dumped into the pot to boil.  We boiled it for about 3 hours .... with tomatoes, potatoes, onions .... everything melted .... the soup was awesome.  added some black pepper as well.    Actually three bottles of whisky!  Don't forget the Chivas!  It was a blast!"

78629,Steelcat,2007-06-03 12:04:00,191,"Thanks for the report   Nice size panfish there.  Next time maybe I'll try your bacon wrap next time.  Actually I've tried panfish soup made by my friend once before, but the problem was he forgot to cut open the fish and removed the internal organ....If we didn't find out about the problem, we would have said it taste pretty good...."
78716,98Fahrenheit,2007-06-03 15:57:00,108, After cleaning the fish ... sprinkle black pepper on the fish ... then use bacon strips to wrap around it ... loosely wrap foil around the fish ... put on a grill ... 15 minutes later ... dig in!!!
78762,Moosebunk,2007-06-03 19:56:00,3970,"Been there, done that.  Except with 5 kegs of beer and 3 cases of whiskey."
78770,Guest Johnny Bass,2007-06-03 20:38:00,0,Excellant Report! Looks like a great Camping trip! Oh and thanks for the blue gill soup recipe. Though I think I will try it with Perch or crappie!
