77069,BFSC Kevin,2007-05-30 16:59:00,1351,"I did a search and saw a few guys had modified their boats. I have a 14 deep v lowe which im thinking of making a deck for on the front with a pedestal seat..  well, i would like to see what others have done to thier boats just to get some ideas and for you guys to show off your skills..!"
77121,Badger Shark,2007-05-30 18:54:00,291,"I built a cheap enclosure for my boat because I was tired of rain and cold wind, I didnt have enough money to have one built so we threw this together.        Not going to win any beauty prizes but it does the job."
77133,fisher,2007-05-30 19:22:00,451,"That's a nice job.  Was thinking of doing something like that to my boat, but just haven't had the time to put into it.  Maybe when winter rolls around again."
77140,brifishrgy,2007-05-30 19:44:00,559,I just got mine done ... got it out last weekend for a test run of the old girl ... the 56 Johnson fired up right away ... just have to figure out the lower end leak and were good to go .. I removed the console and water catch ( also had to replace the transom)... took up too much room    Before and now the after      
77152,BFSC Kevin,2007-05-30 19:59:00,1351,ooo.... i like
77189,glen,2007-05-30 21:05:00,2641,"I just did a complete gut of my boat.  I then put in new foam, main floor,  front and rear casting decks with chairs.  It took about 30 hrs but the boat is awesome i had it out on monday for a test run.  It cost about $800 and i already had the chairs.  The new vinyl from homedepot is real nice $250 for glue and 20' piece.  I will get pics when i get a chance."
77224,Jigger,2007-05-30 22:13:00,1237,"Hope this works...  http://s92.photobucket.com/albums/l13/jmc_...=1180562915.pbw  Its a slideshow, couldn't post it. But the link should work."
77225,BFSC Kevin,2007-05-30 22:13:00,1351,  nope...
77228,Jigger,2007-05-30 22:22:00,1237,HMMM...  I'll do it the old fashioned way:                Good job everyone.
77254,BFSC Kevin,2007-05-30 23:13:00,1351,"awesome job jigger.. did that add alot of weight to your boat? i want to do something similiar but i don't even know how to start, like the how abouts me ripping the benches out.. since they are fastened to the side of the boat... and how to fastens on all the supports/aluminum/wood into the boat...  i assume you can buy the aluminum and marine plywood from home depot.. but how about the marine carpet? i remmeber reading somewhere.. but forgot."
77270,Daplumma,2007-05-30 23:59:00,1961,Some really talented guys here..Good job!Here are some pics of a jet boat Art and I made out of my wife's race boat (jet ski) and an old sears game fisher hull. http://groups.msn.com/HomeMadeJetBoats/recycle.msnw http://groups.msn.com/HomeMadeJetBoats/rec...tseatrials.msnw http://groups.msn.com/HomeMadeJetBoats/rec...decksseats.msnw Joe

77282,Jigger,2007-05-31 00:13:00,1237,"Joe, thats awesome! What was the final top speed?"
77290,Daplumma,2007-05-31 00:20:00,1961,"36.5 I think,but it gets there instantly!I should prop it up  bit but its a handful at that speed.The boat is rated for 15HP or so and the motor is prolly around 120 hp.You lose about 1/3 of the HP by using jet power but its still a wee bit overpowered.We do have a much more powerful motor to put in it but have sorta lost interest after it actually floated and ran. Joe"
77295,Greencoachdog,2007-05-31 00:28:00,8163,"I'll give ya 50 bux for the Grey Goose right now Joe... but don't ponder on it too long, tomorrows price is $45..."
