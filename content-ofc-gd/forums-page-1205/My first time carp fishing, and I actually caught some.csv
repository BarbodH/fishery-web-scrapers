78607,Badger Shark,2007-06-03 07:13:00,291,"Well, I started the day working and around 2pm I decided I had enough, it was warm and humid and I didnt feel like driving anymore.  Al (Jackel)  had left on Friday down to Long Sault but I couldnt get a away to join him, I planned on going down on Sunday but finally I Just said to heck with it, Im going fishing.  So I called another driver to come in and then I told the boss ( my wife ) she is actually the boss where I work, and off I went.  I headed out around three, I am on the 416 south and the sky is looking really mean.  I reached the prescott area and the sky unloaded,  heavy heavy rain till the point where I had to join several others on the side of the highway, while there I took a few pics......             This storm actually hit me twice, it cut across so when I was going south I went through it and then when I headed east I went through it again.  Anyway I made it through and arrived at about 4:15.  I wasnt there all that long when one of the alarms went off and Al says "" its yours "", so I grab the rod and manage to land my first ever carp, nice strong fish.    Apparently the bite had been on all day, they had already caught 34 fish when I arrived, the biggest weighed 33lbs, they said my first one was around 16.  Wasnt long before the next rod went and Al grabbed this one and she was a big fish, 20+ lbs.      Not long after that one Spinner gets one on...    Then there was a bit of a break, lots of fish jumping everywhere but no bites.  Finally about 30 mins go by and the alarm goes off and I have my second carp and this one is bigger, she was running all over the place and headed towards the shore where there is a rock wall covered in  zebra mussels so I was doing my best to keep her away from there, luckily after a good fight I got here in.     We all took turns and we were sitting on number 39 for a long time, Spinner had one on two different times but they got off.  As soon as he said "" looks like were not going to get 40 ""  my rod goes off and I grab it, this one is my biggest so far and she was running all over the place, twice to the left, right straight out for a long run and to the right towards the rock wall.  Finally after about 10 minutes or so ( it felt like 30) I landed my 3rd and biggest, this one was over 20 and I was a happy carper. And also it was number 40.     Here are a couple of other shots.      The total fish caught was 41, Spinner finally managed to hook one and get her in.  I was supposed to stay the night there but the wife was having a bad night so I came home and took her out to see a movie, but only if we can head back down there tomorrow after she is done work at noon.  She said yes and also said she is going to catch a bigger one than me.  And I am sure she will and she deserves to, but I am going to try very hard to beat her.  I hopefully will have an even better report tomorrow with more pics.... till then, see ya.  Don"
