78143,kennyman,2007-06-01 16:48:00,737,"Now that's funny. ""Fish porn"" LOL. Very sexy looking fish by the way. I too thank you for posting pics of the rig. I don't know why, but I would've never looked at that one. I'm just learning, but I just figured green or brass/copper. Obviously AGAIN I know nothing.  I've heard wallies like purple too?? True??"
78155,Patches,2007-06-01 17:10:00,48,"  On sunny days, I like the darker colours.  Our water is gin clear to 35 feet, so the metallics are working very well."
