78620,aplumma,2007-06-03 10:58:00,6896,If it will keep me from seeing you in your boxer shorts I will bring you a spool of your favorite line. The only catch is it will be delivered at Lak Air. Send a PM with the poundage and type of line you use if you are going to make it to Lak Air.  Nice fish glad to see you are getting out to the water.   Art

Sounded like my Friday night that's for sure!  Congrats on your fish...took some work, but you got him in.  Oh and as far as bullhead are concerned, don't cut your line because 1...you cant afford to work with any less line and 2, it's not worth losing a hook for!!! LOL"
