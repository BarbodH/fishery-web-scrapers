78976,Muskieman,2007-06-04 14:03:00,2472,"My 1998 Rude 30 tiller is acting up. when i reach full throttle is seems to misfire until it warms up..then i'm ok. this morning i went out and it did the same it ran fine for 10 minutes full throttle and then cut to one cylinder. after a while of investigation i determined that the lower ignition coil was'nt firing. i trolled home to the dock with my electric.  i decided to try it out at the dock and it ran fine on 2 cylinders. and after a 2 minute ride the coil cut out again. now in my driveway with the muccf on it ran fine full out for 2 minutes and did it again. #1 ; i'll try switching my coils around, sounds like the lower one gets hot and cuts out, cools off and runs fine. #2 C.D.I i do not want to buy a new one!!!  too $$  strange.. it just started to run on one again  and i give it a shot of gas and #2 kicks in.  plugs are new, checked all my wiring for cracks corrosion and ect . everything is tight.  gel behind C.D.I is clean and does'nt seem to have heated up dry as a bone.  i've heard of smaller Rudes havin coil problems but are these the right symptoms.  cause i know that on a car a coil either works or it does'nt.  Fishin for tips.  thanks for all the help in advance.  Muskieman"
78978,Gerritt,2007-06-04 14:08:00,6129,"Odd. I am also looking at replacing a Coil..... one thing to try try a different set of plugs. I know you stated they are new but I have seen more then one plug act up new from the box, Make sure it is also properly gapped. Try a Decent plug NGK's are probably the best out there. worth a shot brother. Also check the wire from the coil to the plug for a short.  Good luck!  Gerritt."
79014,Zib,2007-06-04 14:50:00,369,I have the same problem with my 1990 35HP Force tiller (biggest POS ever made). A new coil would cost me $190 US & that POS motor isn't worth that much.  Good luck in fixing your problem.
79029,Muskieman,2007-06-04 15:04:00,2472,I just got off the phone with BRP's tech line and it sounds like a coil to them.  Randy
79068,Fisherman,2007-06-04 16:15:00,7201,"Are you most definitely sure it's a coil and not a bad plug.  I had the same symptoms on an old chainsaw, ran for 1-2 minutes then died, let it cool, then it would go like a bat outa hades for another 2 minutes.  Tried an old plug, problem solved."
79072,bigbuck,2007-06-04 16:19:00,2449,"Try getting new plugs first, it could be a bad plug, you never know. 15 bucks is better than a couple of hundred. If it isn't the plugs, well, you will have a spare set in the boat (which you should anyways). Good luck and good fishing."
79094,Muskieman,2007-06-04 16:42:00,2472,i just put 2 plugs i for good measure and it ran fine for 10 minutes full tilt and is doing the same. i swapped the coils from top to bottom and guess what now it's the top cylinder that gets no spark. now i'm 99.9% sure it's a coil. time to call the dealer .
79272,boatman,2007-06-04 23:02:00,350,Cutting out when hot is a classic coil problem. Best to take it to the dealer unless you are comfortable doing it yourself.
