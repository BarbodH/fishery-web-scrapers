78823,FISHINGNUT,2007-06-03 23:25:00,253,"Hit the Lower Grand on Friday after work.Casted for about an hour without a sniff so we decided to troll.Then the action picked up to many sheep head to count I dont know how any thing can survive with those things eating every thing  We even picked up 3 cats on walley divers trolling.We saw alot of BIG carp sunning them selfs just below the surface.Around 8;00pm the sheep head stopped hitting and the eyes finally woke up picked up 7 decent eaters the biggest around 19"" kept 3 for Sunday dinner released the others and lost a few to boot.All in all a great day out.The date on the camera is wrong. http://i79.photobucket.com/albums/j143/JamieJen/100_0696.jpg http://i79.photobucket.com/albums/j143/JamieJen/100_0699.jpg http://i79.photobucket.com/albums/j143/Jam.../100_0692-1.jpg http://i79.photobucket.com/albums/j143/JamieJen/100_0697.jpg http://i79.photobucket.com/albums/j143/JamieJen/100_0701.jpg"
