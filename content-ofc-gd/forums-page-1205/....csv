78680,Rich Clemens,2007-06-03 13:43:00,3131,"Looks like ya had a great variety to keep things interesting for the day.  Great report.  Hey GCD, in those last couple pics, the PFD you're wearing,  which one is that ?   It looks very similar to the Bass Pro XPS (automatic) TYPE II  that just arrived at my door a couple days age.   If so, whatta think of them ?  14 more sleeps for me too .... arriving Sunday afternoon on the 17th."

78690,Rich Clemens,2007-06-03 13:51:00,3131,"Sounds good.  BPS has their Father's Day sale going on and picked it up for $119 (30 bucks off).  Got one for myself and my fishing partner (Hope she likes it).     Sorry ... don't want to steal your post, but had to ask."
78692,Bly,2007-06-03 14:14:00,1556,Good to hear that fence is almost done and that you can get back at the important stuff   .   Good report and the nudity wasn't sooo bad.  Would love to catch that variety in a single outing and congrats on the tourney entry.   One of these days I am going to try a sabiki rig (modified for Canada of course)  Ahh Lakair...think we are all starting to count the sleeps!  Bly
78701,Whopper,2007-06-03 15:03:00,2174,"Where's the fish all I see is ya holding bait  J/K those spots are marked well and that 17"" er is a nice one!  Good to see ya out away from the fence Glen.  Whopper"

78801,tbayboy,2007-06-03 22:20:00,1497,Nice mix there but this full frontal nudity trend can't lead us anywhere but downhill
78858,Daplumma,2007-06-04 01:02:00,1961,Thats not a bad day fishin at all Dawg....Nice hat! Joe
78885,Mike the Pike,2007-06-04 02:43:00,3421,"Great multi nudity report and shots Glen ,First the shots of the T-shirt ,\then no shirt Yuk but why did you wait until the end to put on your PFD.  I know it doubles as girdle I see it keeps the Red Neck gut in sinc  Gongrats on the double header glad to see you got away from the yard work you were due to post a report. \ MTP"
78886,wolfville,2007-06-04 02:53:00,396,"Hmm...never noticed your smile....and it looks good. Thanks for smiling and trying to get something on you. And yes, nice fish !"
78887,Carp,2007-06-04 02:55:00,1488,"A nice day on the water for you Glen, but in regards to you nude pics, maybe you should fish when it's cooler out."
78901,motv8tr,2007-06-04 07:26:00,2587,"Good stuff Glen, that's quite a variety you got there, now just bring that catching prowess up here with you would ya.  Maureen"
