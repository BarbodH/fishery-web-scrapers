78166,SlowPoke,2007-06-01 17:54:00,2984,"Good job boys! Very impressive fish! Clive, caught on orange or black or orange and black? That musta felt good getting a monster on one of your own lures! -Brian"
78256,mepps,2007-06-01 21:40:00,1301,"Caught on lures with no feathers Brian, but when I use the feathered lures orange has been more effective then black."

78625,mepps,2007-06-03 11:59:00,1301,"We have a few more 40+ inchers to share once we get some rest.  Just finished the 22+ hour drive to Toronto, but i still need to get back to London.  John - There is a wireless connection. The range isnt great, we had no connection from our cabin - we went and sat outside near the main cabin and got a strong connection.  If you have no laptop, Brett has a computer in the main cabin aswell."
