78606,holdfast,2007-06-03 06:39:00,1813,"Went out 5 minutes from hear and shore fished the N Sask River.  Not a bite but shot the hoot with a boat that came in where I was shore fishing and the locals  said they caught 15  pickeral and one sturgeon.  Showed me a pic of a 30 lb,  At least I have hope.  Just moved hear last Aug testing the waters."
