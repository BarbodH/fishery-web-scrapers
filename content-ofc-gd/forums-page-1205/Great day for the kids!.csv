I have alot of respect for the parents for putting in a great effort and surviving the heat all day.  This year there were many more catfish than last. Numerous cats in the 10+ pound range.  There were about 700 entries this year with some very big fish coming in.  The winning channel catfish was almost 18 pounds and brought in by a girl.    Largest carp was 28 pounds.    We also had a winning sunfish hybrid @ almost 1 pound (.96) with a length of ten inches and a girth of 9 inches. The current record is 1.04 so it was a nice fish.  ]  attachment=2397:100_24642.jpg][  A very great day for all with some great prizes for the kids. Hats off to all the volunteers who make this event a success and without their help it would not exist.    Hope more will come next year..
