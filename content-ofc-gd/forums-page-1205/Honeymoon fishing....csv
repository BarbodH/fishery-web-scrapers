78392,spanky,2007-06-02 13:32:00,195,"So the wife dragged me on a fishing honeymoon.... geeesh... anyways, we went to the Temagami area to Ravenscroft lodge on Jumping Caribou lake, upon getting there (a day early) we settled in and relaxed for the night... i will include the honeymoon pics at the bottom of the post...  Day 1:  had breakfast (didn't have to cook a thing all trip, meals were taken care of), wifey decided she wanted to do some touristy stuff.... so a 25min drive later we arrived in Temagami to piddle around the shops and stuff... stopped at the tackle shop (Dad's) on our way in, talked to the owner and he said ""wow, tough lake to fish..."" oh great i thought this'll be interesting, guy at the Gramp's tackle shop said the same thing, so i was discouraged a bit, haven't been north in about 10yrs and never fished this area, and am not a walleye fisherman- if there's no weeds, i'm usually pretty lost lol.... oh well, not there to fish a whole lot anyways... snapped a few pics while in Temagami...   Then naturally the wifey got on this kick about seeing a moose, so 50km's later down this gravel backroad in a dodge neon we see this...    yep, a ground hog... not even close to resembling the moose, but hey whatever right.... also found this neat little spot...    Day 2: saw a bit of fishing, 4hrs worth, the most we did in a day i think, played around the lake snapped a few more pics of the scenery    During lunch i played around trying to get a pic of these little guys...    while doing so... we hear something that's not quite bird like... landed about 200ft from our cabin lol      our sunset looked something like this... from the boat      and from the cabin...    Day 3: total write off, we had rain on Day 2 and had to pick our spots for getting out, but day 3 was t-storms all day long= no fishing... but we did go moose hunting (camera only, wife had never seen one) with SUCCESS lol... look very close and you can see a moose's ass... 2 of them were standing along side HWY 11 in a marshy area, one staring at us and the other walking away, guess which one the wifey took pics of  :    Day 4: well, finally some success, again 2 t-storms rolled through... 1 first thing in the morning and one later at night, so we headed out in the sunshine in the late morning and again for an hour after lunch... and the results were...      the only 2 fish of the trip, which she caught, the big one came home and the small one swam away, despite the wifey trying to eat it raw lol....  and our last night...    that concluded the honeymoon... was awesome to get away, wifey didn't wanna come home... our hosts were incredible, food was awesome (despite the fact that the servings were HUUUUGE lol), cabins were above par and the area was beautiful... big thanks to Joe and Julie the owners of the lodge, their hospitality was 2nd to none!!... will hopefully be retuning this september for some more fishing and more relaxing!!  more random pics...      sorry if the pic quality is off, was learning to use the camera on fully manual... think i did okay lol  and for what took place at the after fishing party.... if you cannot see the pics you are either too young or not mature enough to see them LOL j/k  "

I'm learning on a Koday P850... with a B+W circular polarizer, the next step is a Nikon SLR i'm looking at.. shhh haven't told the wife yet lol"
78617,Rich Clemens,2007-06-03 10:45:00,3131,Just tell her that the new camera will take great shots of teh fish she catches.
78632,Tarzan's Jane,2007-06-03 12:10:00,1183,Just buy your wife the camera...problem solved.
78637,Smokey,2007-06-03 12:22:00,1278,"Great read Thanks. A fishing honeymoon, i'd say your off to a great start. Better luck next time with the fishing."
78657,Carp,2007-06-03 12:52:00,1488,Looks like my kind of honeymoon.  You're a lucky guy to have a wife who enjoys the outdoors.  My wife won't go in our yard after dark because there's been some viscious killer racoons hanging around.
78806,spanky,2007-06-03 22:52:00,195,"It was soooo funny, the night before we left she was actually quite upset we had to come home, she's 25yo (for the last 5yrs lol) now and talking about retiring to the north, and she's already making plans to head back up in september!!... she's a country girl at heart tho, got married on her old farm and for the wedding pics we took a hay ride lol.... think i'm the luckiest man in the world!!  I did let the Nikon camera purchase slip... and well, let's say it's new to the market and i will be getting at DSLR when it comes down to a price i like lol  thanks everyone!!"
