The shoulder of the sprinkler sprocket spritzers have a special thread, calling for a Langstron 7 in gangly wrench.These sprinkler sprockets are all connected to a breaker system. My question is this, can i use a 9 inch gangly wrench, which is more easily available, or will this cause too much bric-a brac to accumulate on the breaker, causeing the breaker to break.In the manual, it clearly say that broken breakers caused by bric-a brac, are not covered under the materials manufacturing warranty. If i happen to break a breaker beacuse i used a 9 in langstrom gangly wrench instead of a 7 in, are there breakers available that can handle the extra bric-a brac?            Now i have a huge headache.....i think i will go lay down  "

We only have one rod between us, which we will share....so we only need one license, right? Also, can someone tell us where we should fish?  I've heard walleye and brook trout taste really good, so any of your favourite spots for them should work fine....as long as it's no more than an hour away from Toronto....and that's without driving on 400-series highways....I only have my G1.
