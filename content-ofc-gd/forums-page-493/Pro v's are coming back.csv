618784,bucktail,2011-09-06 02:00:00,1857,Lund's new list of boats for next year includes the 1775 and 1875 ProV's.  I am excited as I will be looking for a new boat in a few years and have always wanted the 18 foot proV but it was discontinued.  Unfortunatly they come bundeled with a merc but I am sure a dealer will be more then happy ($ ) to put a Yamaha on it for me.   http://www.lundboats.com/boats/2011-aluminum/pro-v-boats    D

618842,vince.bornais,2011-09-06 12:09:00,50,I've had the 1775 PRO V SE since 2000. It's been a great boat. The only problem I've had was figuring out the battery situation for both the cranking battery & the trolling motor batteries. Other than that I have no complaints.
