Trying to get it in order for the cure for cancer tourney...hope you's can help"
601976,bigbuck,2011-07-12 14:06:00,2449,Check your fuel lines to see if there is an issue with venting. Does the primer bulb on the fuel line stay full after you give it a couple of squeezes??
601986,HTHM,2011-07-12 14:24:00,4082,The good news is: You won't need the engine for the tourney. I don't know if you were aware but the lake is electric only. The bad news is: I have no idea what to advise you on your engine.
601998,Pikeslayer,2011-07-12 15:00:00,1443,  Is it peeing?
602004,DRIFTER_016,2011-07-12 15:22:00,10439,Could be a few things. First off it could be a fuel problem or an electrical issue. I have a couple of questions: after it dies do you have to pump the primer bulb to get it to restart? Have you checked the fuel filter to see that it is full of fuel when the engine dies? If you have and the filter is empty/bulb needs to be used to reprime the system you either have an air leak before the primer in the line or you have a problem with the fuel pump. If fuel is fine you probably have an electrical issue either an intermittant ignition component or a loose connection somewhere. Check all connections and disconnect and reconnect any bullet connectors. If the problem persists head on over to your local Honda Marine Mechanic and have them look it over for you.
602220,tightline,2011-07-13 11:30:00,322,"The bulb does soften up and re priming is necessary...it ran like a dream the last time I had it out until the last day of our trip?  Then on the way back to camp this prob started arising??  Thanks HTHM for that news flash, would have been a slow day on the water paddling my 14ftr around"
602254,fishermccann,2011-07-13 14:57:00,655,That happened to me and I found out that the fuel filter was semi-pluged the presure when you pump the bulb would force more gas past the obstruction. If the motor will keep going if you continue to pump the bulb then I would bet that is what is wrong.
602258,irishfield,2011-07-13 15:24:00,26272,On the same lines don't forget there is a screen over the intake tube in the fuel tank as well that could be clogged or the tube itself has come dislodged and you're sucking air.
618232,tightline,2011-09-03 17:46:00,322,Anybody know where I can find an engine schematic for this motor online without having to buy it for 40 bucks!!!
618233,Terry,2011-09-03 18:17:00,14456,when I had the same problem it was where the gas line meets the engine it was sucking a little air  if I squeezed the blub real hard I could get some gas to leak out  a new connector or a bit of teflon tape solved the problem for me on a honda 5 hp
618286,fish_fishburn,2011-09-04 00:33:00,1311,X2 what Terry said.
618292,whitbyboatguy,2011-09-04 02:04:00,130,saw a simliar thread on iboat forums. Can't remember much about it other than it was posted this month and is in the mercury/mariner section.
618300,Dara,2011-09-04 03:09:00,3052,  its a fuel problem  and the board wouldn't let me do all the multi quotes I had planned
618339,Terry,2011-09-04 11:48:00,14456,click on the MultiQuotes you want then click on Use Full Editor  and it should work for you
618434,Big Cliff,2011-09-04 21:09:00,6899," Yup, first thing I would do is change the fuel filter based on the fact that it happened to you on a return trip. But it could be as Wayne suggested or an air leak. My bet would be on the fuel filter though."
618993,johnnyb,2011-09-06 19:17:00,3413,Just wondering if ethanol could be part of the problem?  I've run into similar problems and a bit of stabilizer cleared things up...I know squat about this stuff...but thought that might be worth mentioning
619005,dave524,2011-09-06 19:47:00,4508,"Could be as simple as that little O ring in the gas connector to the engine, had much the same symptoms once , that was it."
619024,lpu_ofn,2011-09-06 20:33:00,29,Does it idle/run poorly or roughly?  It could be a fuel/air mixture issue. or Bad fuel pump Bad gas Plugged Fuel Filter Plugged or Pinched Fuel Line Major vacuum leak ......   
619049,tightline,2011-09-06 22:01:00,322,Idles nice...things really starting to urk me... thinking about taking the steel toes to it..smarten it up a bit!!!
