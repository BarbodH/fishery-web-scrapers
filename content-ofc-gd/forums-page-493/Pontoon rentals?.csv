618922,Sketty55,2011-09-06 15:44:00,52,Hi all. I've been looking to make one last trip with the boys this summer (what's left of it) and have been trying to look for a pontoon rental anywhere within 2 to 2.5hrs from the GTA. I've been calling around and the earliest I can seem to find one is for 8am. Anyone have any suggestions for a rental place that offers something earlier? Thanks!
