617855,Miracon,2011-09-01 20:43:00,200,"I just wanted to thank the awesome members here!  Since deciding to go away fishing this weekend only a few days ago and having no clue about fishing at all (except a few pathetic past attempts and a handful of sunfish!), I am soooo glad I found this forum first!  From the great members here I learned where to fish, found accommodation, was advised where to specifically fish at that location, what to use on our hooks and a technique to catch. Wow! I am soooo excited about this trip and from all the great recommendations, am hopeful I will actually catch something!  I have printed out all the advice and will follow it to a T! I can't wait to come back here and report the experience.  Thanks for being patient with a newbie! I know how frustrating we are (I am a mod in a few other unrelated forums and hate people like me!!! Haha!).  In your debt!!"
617875,GBW,2011-09-01 21:53:00,8460,"good luck!  just make sure everyone has what is needed, safety gear, fishing license and boaters card before you hit the water.  don't forget to take pic's!"
617878,Miracon,2011-09-01 21:58:00,200, Will do! Off to Crappy Tire in a few minutes to get the fishing licenses.  Hope I end up with a few good pics to post!
617883,GBW,2011-09-01 22:04:00,8460,just make sure all people are there with you with photo ID as those CT folks can be a pain from time to time.
617884,GBW,2011-09-01 22:05:00,8460,"ps, the boaters card, I don't think you can do today unless the store close to you is offering a session."
617886,ccmtcanada,2011-09-01 22:13:00,7971, Hey now!  What exactly are you saying Geoff???? Lol  Good luck Miracon. Please come back and tell us how you did!  Did we mention we like pictures??? Haha.
617892,Musky or Specks,2011-09-01 22:40:00,2710,Just so you know... FISH PORN or it didn't happen
617899,Miracon,2011-09-01 23:03:00,200," Thanks Geoff! Good to know. And I was actually just looking to take the boaters exam online tonight. If I can't get it, I'll be rowing instead! :-(  Thanks ccmt! Hope I end up with a few good one's to post!  Musky - not sure about the Fish Porn comment! That went right over my head (not that I'm a stranger to porn! Did I say that out loud??!!!)!"
617904,ccmtcanada,2011-09-01 23:32:00,7971,Lol Miracon...he means just pics of people holding fish.  This is a family site after all!  And Geoff knows I work for Crappy Tire...lol
617945,Rizzo,2011-09-02 01:28:00,4754,...if you do the exact opposite of everything people told you I think you'll do just fine
617975,Miracon,2011-09-02 03:28:00,200,LMAO @ the whole Fish Porn thing! We had actually just started making a new video!!!! ;-) But I get it now! We can cancel the amateurs! LOL  @ Rizzo...Don't say that now...we just bought stuff based on everyone's recommendations! Haha!  Actually...We went to Crappy Tire (sorry ccmt!) for licenses and found Quantum combos on sale...reg. $129.00 for $79.00 (plus 10% off from fishing license application). Please don't tell me they are crap after deciding to splurge on that purchase....Hahaha!  Got great fishing line and picking up live worms (besides the plastic Yums recommended here!). So hoping we are not off to a horrible start as newbies!  Oh...and hit the Beer and LCBO store so think we are prepared!  Can't wait to check back in with everyone and hopefully have a few awesome pics (PORN quality!) with a few fish!
618038,GBW,2011-09-02 14:32:00,8460,"naw, you got a good deal on those combo's you got at CTC.  Don't get me wrong, CTC is good but some of the people have no clue what they are talking about.  Not CCMT, the ones in the store.  As for the beer and lcbo run, keep in on the shore as you want to come back from your trip.  that and the OPP will be out in full force this weekend as it's the last long weekend.  And the new law is if you are busted in a boat you get your Drivers lic. suspended, the one for your car not the boaters card..."
618647,Miracon,2011-09-05 20:05:00,200," Glad to know the rods are good! They worked great! Except...I can't catch anything to save my life! Haha! I did not catch one single fish...not one. Not even a sunfish! A couple next to us casting out in the same spot as me, caught 12 blue gills between them using the exact same bait as us...everyone laughed at me! Not a single bite...nothing, not even one that got away! It's quite the joke now considering how excited I was to go fishing! Haha!  At least my other half caught a decent sized pickerel and small mouth bass. So it wasn't a total wasted trip. And I am not giving up and continuing to fish locally in Barrie.  At least I found out I'm great at starting a fire!"
618699,ccmtcanada,2011-09-05 21:48:00,7971,"Yes, but where are the pictures??? Lol  Sounds like you had a great time!"
618702,solopaddler,2011-09-05 22:23:00,8605,"  Your humour and enthusiasm are refreshing. Don't give up, you'll soon be catching and not just fishing."
618767,NAW,2011-09-06 01:28:00,4022,Check your PM..
618791,Miracon,2011-09-06 02:16:00,200,ccmt-I have a pic of the 2 fish my hubby caught but they are just in a cooler and are embarrassing compared to all the pics in here! Haha! Will post anyway for proof! Haha!  solopaddler-That is very kind of you to say! I will keep going! Thanks!
618867,Miracon,2011-09-06 13:29:00,200,"Here are the pics of the 2 fish hubby caught. Being amateurs, he didn't even know how to hold the fish so I could take Porn Quality! Haha! We just knew they had big teeth and were pretty pissed! That will be our next lesson...how to hold the damn things for pics!   His first good (to us anyway!) catch...    Attempting to hold it...non-teeth method! Haha!    Notice Gordon's Rocks in the background as was recommended by a member here - we were in a rowboat rowing against the wind so getting behind the rocks was a chore!...    The 2nd catch keeping the first company! No Porn pic...his teeth were bigger! Hahahahaha!    The only thing I caught and even that went over the my hubby!    The awesome couple Bob and Sue who showed us how to prepare the fish...   And at least I got to eat fish even though I spent the weekend just feeding them!!! "
618869,woodenboater,2011-09-06 13:37:00,2277,"Miracon,  I rank anyone with good fire starting skills right up there with paddlers who don't whinge about tumplines"
618871,manitoubass2,2011-09-06 13:41:00,11391,"Miracon, great going!  Gotta start somewhere, and it looks like your on the right track for alot of fun.  The ""pickeral"" can be held with your fingers on the belly, and your thumb holding down the dorsal fin (the spiney fin on the back of the fish) or vise versa such as in this pic , just slide your thumb from the top of the fin to compress it cause its very sharp.    If it's a larger fish, you can slip your hand into the gills to hold the fish, just dont grab it by the gill plate, its very sharp. This pic doesnt show my hand, lol, but this is what it looks like held up.    and a smallmouth bass has rough ""pads"" for teeth and they are not sharp, just insert your thumb into the mouth and hold it against your finger, this is called lipping    Hope this helps a little. lol"
618886,Miracon,2011-09-06 14:26:00,200,Maintou - thanks for those pics! That is extremely helpful!!!  Woodenboater - Thanks for that vote of confidence! Here is a pic of the fire (no lighter fluid involved!)...  
618891,Miracon,2011-09-06 14:38:00,200, LMAO Sinclair! Too funny! It actually holds 5 beers!  Found it at a garage sale for $2 and was the only way I could keep dragging him around with me!
