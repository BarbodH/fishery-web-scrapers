I gassed up the boat and launched , and was on my spot at 15h05.....by 15h35 ..(66* surface temp 20FOW) I had caught 9 Walleye about the same size 36cm.. and a few Smallies followed and a then few Rock Bass .. then 2 more Walleye........ I kept fishing 'til I ran out of worms.  I pulled into the driveway at 17h05..I brought 4 of these home with me.   ........ heading back on Wednesday with Leeches and Minnows  I think the Falleye have arrived.   Randy  "
