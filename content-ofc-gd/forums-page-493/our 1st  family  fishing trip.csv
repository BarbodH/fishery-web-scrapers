618197,sash,2011-09-03 12:22:00,26,"Well I read on here that some members took their kids to Golden Beach Resort and found it was a great place for a 1st camping trip.  We packed up the car with our tents, sleeping bags,fishing rods etc and headed for our 1st family camping trip. We arrived the 1st  night and set up and had a camp fire, roasted marshmallows, made smores and booked a boat for the next 3 days. We headed out for our  1st fishing trip with a brand new ugly stick for the boy that we needed to break in, we just set up in the weeds and picked on the  panfish and he kept on getting better and better.  The following days were much of the same but more and more fish, the highlight  had to be looking over at the boy struggling with a crappie which ended up joining us for a late night snack over the campfire, it  overshadowed my 22"" walleye (released of course) that i fought for what seemed an eternity on my bobber and light tackle and barely fit into our  panfish net.
