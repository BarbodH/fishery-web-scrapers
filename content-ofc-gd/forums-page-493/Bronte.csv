618381,toca,2011-09-04 14:58:00,274,Do you own the waters chewy?
618382,Live2fish85,2011-09-04 15:09:00,1633," I would assume that they are fishing close to shore for the same reason you are fishing bronte with all the other people on the Pier, because that's where the fish are. I mean you don't see that pier full everyday through the summer. That's because the fish aren't there. If you had a boat and the fish were in staging would you go out deep. Or stay where you know they are."
618389,landry,2011-09-04 15:45:00,1005,As long as the boats are out of your casting range then you have no complaints.
618785,chewy,2011-09-06 02:06:00,40,"thats right i dont own the waters just respect as long as its out of casting range .i respect everyone when i go fishing and expect the same .ive had people in boats fishing 20 feet away from peir ,i think thats just pure ignarence.TIGHT LINES ALL.and i fish everywhere not just bronte and see ignarence everywhere."
618787,chewy,2011-09-06 02:09:00,40,and if i owned a boat i would stay far enough back not to interupt land fishers .if the salmon are in and ur in a boat u can stay out of casting area and still slaughter fish just my 2 cents
617163,tightline,2011-08-30 20:15:00,322,I just heard from a friend there starting to catch at the Bronte pier? Anybody been lately thinking of going on Sunday?
617165,fishinguypat,2011-08-30 20:22:00,547,"Really i would stay put until a good rainfall, but if you live close then why not"
617166,solopaddler,2011-08-30 20:24:00,8605,  Rainfall is the last thing you want.  They usually do start to stage off Bronte this time year. Give 'er a shot.
617171,mbosh1980,2011-08-30 20:30:00,349,"I think I should try chucking some spoons this year... I did hear though that the credit isn't expecting much of a run at all, so all the lurkers should head east or west of there and they should do fine."
617173,johnnyb,2011-08-30 20:40:00,3413,Yup...nothing scheduled for the Credit this year at allll...STAY AWAAYYYYY FROM THE CREDIT
617174,fishinguypat,2011-08-30 20:40:00,547,"iheard owen sound is sarting to get a run already, suppose to be better then last year, and i guess rainfall would drive them up river but still its a little warm for my liking"
617178,tightline,2011-08-30 20:44:00,322,"A buddy from work got a 30 pd'r on sunday off the pier, just wondered wether they r just staging up or starting to hit the river"
617187,Roy,2011-08-30 20:58:00,13728,I'd wait a little. I don't think they're quite ripe enough.
617215,Aaron Shirley,2011-08-30 22:14:00,655,"Solo is right, a rainfall will trigger the staging kings to run up river. Put some time in casting the pier at night and first thing in the mornings, and you should see some activity at most creek and river mouths. They are staging now, and the piers are packed shoulder-to-shoulder with anglers at night."
617353,Fish4Eyes,2011-08-31 11:51:00,1022,Took the wife for a walk along Bronte early last week and saw a guy catch one off the pier around 8PM ish. I over heard a guy on the phone alerting his buddies that a salmon has been caught as the guy was fighting it
617361,BITEME,2011-08-31 12:26:00,1968,  HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA coffe up the nose on the keyboard just everywhere  Thanks Roy
617365,Harrison,2011-08-31 12:37:00,2202," We were in a boat fishing just outside their casting range the other night, there was a ton of guys on the pier.  When there was a lull we would watch the light show as they hauled on their smokes.  Almost like it went with the music. Those who have been out there will know what I mean"
617376,dobee,2011-08-31 13:21:00,301,"i was out on the kayak last night until 11:30 - the smoking on the pier is hilarious... countless times last night we heard "" FISH ON!!"" ---- ""hey bud! you got my line!""  i love fall."
617419,solopaddler,2011-08-31 15:24:00,8605,  Joe you're alive!  Looking forward to the fall season bud.  Cheers
617443,Fang,2011-08-31 16:16:00,1330,For a laugh I went down to bronte peir last Friday night around 8. It was just getting dark and the zoo was in full swing - loads of guys out on the pier and fishing the wall inside. Honestly you couldn't pay me enough to get back out there. I live close and pick and choose my spots when it's quiet through the week. Weekends are nuts. The funniest part was the guys that were picking the beach for firewood to take back on the peir. I guess they were planning to spend the night.
617593,bucktail,2011-09-01 00:44:00,1857,"Fish are gone tonight, east wind pushed alot of warm water in. went all the way to 140 and its a deadzone. Need a west wind to push the warm water out to get the fish back."
617628,Joeytier,2011-09-01 01:53:00,3990,"Yeah, I was out this evening with the same results.  Thunderstorms tonight..."
617897,tightline,2011-09-01 22:57:00,322,My Buddy was out last night and only saw 1 fish off the pier..Going to go out Sunday with the 14ft'r 5.5hp and troll the mouth..never done it before would any of you do it or am I an idiot for thinking it?
617900,misfish,2011-09-01 23:05:00,29133,"On calm days,I did the troll out from the 4 sisters with a 14ft tin Miro,and a 9.9."
617902,danbouck,2011-09-01 23:07:00,4380,Just watch the weather and the spoons flying toward you and you will be fine.
617903,vinnimon,2011-09-01 23:20:00,2593,"  To add to dans point, watch for darting lines heading towards your boat. And listen to all the screaming from shore. Thats why I like spoonchucking when every one is at work When the regular gents and relaxed folks are there."
617936,tightline,2011-09-02 01:09:00,322,I'm definetley going to stay out of casting range..lol..figured I'd troll spoons at 40 feet in the mouth and see if I get lucky?
618087,mbosh1980,2011-09-02 18:57:00,349, I saw an 8' zodiac with about a 3.5 on the back of it out today...
618315,fishinguypat,2011-09-04 06:51:00,547,
618370,chewy,2011-09-04 14:01:00,40,"i dont understand when ur fishing from a boat ,why do u need to fish so close to shore u have the whole lake,some of use only have the shores or peires to fish from."
