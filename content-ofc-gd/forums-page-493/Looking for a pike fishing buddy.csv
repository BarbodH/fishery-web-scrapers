Since my wife doesnot allow me go fishing alone ... I need one fishing buddy go simcoe fishing with me (usually any day as long as it is cloudy or raining ... windy day ok as long as 1700ProSportLund+115HP can handle) ... Prefer some one with a hitch so that there is no cost split on each trip. Please PM me if any one is interested...  thanks,  James"
