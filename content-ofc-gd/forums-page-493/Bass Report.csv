Fishing shoreline we managed to get a couple quick bites in this cold front day. Rick got the first a healthy 3lb 12oz largie    And another one by Rick. It was not easy to fish, all bundled up getting smashed by the waves out there was a little tough but the action kept us fishing.    Not 10 minutes after Rick released his last bass I get a bite right close to the bank, set the hook and this pig came straight to the boat. Pulled under  the boat a  little bending my rod in half haha. We got her in and back in the water quick.  A 5lb 2oz largemouth bass, such a nice fish. I've been lucky this summer to get a few.    You can see the scars from over the years...aka missing fin lol    The action continued a little but we decided to stay close to home and keep trying similar stuff. Rick picked up another two and I got another just under 2lbs. We also lost a nice bass boatside a easy 4 pounder.  A ounce shy under 3lbs    And the last of the day today,     We had a great time out there. Hope you enjoyed the pic's, and I will be here with another report soon I hope!  Take Care guys  MTBF"

618717,MCTFisher9120,2011-09-05 23:24:00,3761," Thanks for the reply. I have come a long way since my early days with the fishing snake here on OFC lol. All said I now have a rod for crankbaits that will be another new world to me. Will have lot's to learn next season once I get a wack of cranks. Got to love pitching jigs, they always produce something. Take patience sometimes but it's always worth it.  Tightlines solo"
