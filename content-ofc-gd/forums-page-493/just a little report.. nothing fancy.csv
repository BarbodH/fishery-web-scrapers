618319,adolson,2011-09-04 07:52:00,783,"I almost feel stupid posting pics of the handfuls of tiny fish I catch when some of you guys are catching 80lb bass and 10ft muskies and 400 walleyes in 20 minutes and whatever, but here goes.  My cousin - let's call him.. Adam, which is fitting, since that's his name - has gone fishing with me several times this summer, but has yet to catch anything. I was determined to help hook him into his first bass, and today I succeeded.  It took a trip to beautiful Anima-Nipissing to do it, but clearly the Montreal River was only being kind to me so we had to try elsewhere.  The weather was nice. It got chilly towards the end of the day, but there was only a light sprinkle of rain when we launched. Not too much wind, so the lake was fairly calm the whole time.  He caught the first fish of the day, a little rock bass - it's no muskie, but hey, it's something.   Shortly after this, I caught the first REAL fish of the day, a smallmouth. It wasn't much bigger (they're all pretty small, the ones I've caught in this lake so far).   The Sportspal was nice to us today, no water leaked in whatsoever.   We managed to get our first double-header, too! Just stupid rock bass, though... Mine is the bigger one.   I knew it was just a matter of time before he'd get a bass, and as we trolled along the shoreline, we came across a long, sunken tree trunk, and somewhere near it, he hooked one, and he looked pretty excited.   We saw it jump, and I knew it had finally happened. I had helped someone with a first.  I was almost as happy as he was:   I normally don't pay much attention to it, but there were tons of fish blips on the GameBoy fish finder, and since he caught one, we turned around and trolled over the same log again. And whaddyaknow? He gets his second smallie, and it's bigger, about 16"".   So, we turned around and trolled back over the same area. I got my second tiny smallie that time:   We ended up each catching two smallmouth, his first two ever, and at least three rock bass each, before we headed back with a nearly-dead battery (argh, stupid charger don't work properly), and we were cold and hungry and tired, and our butts were sooooooooooore from those cement hard foam seats.   Obviously not the most amazing report, but for us, it was great times. He was so happy to get his first bass, and that in turn made me really happy. I was happier when he was catching fish than when I was, which was weird. I'm no guide, but I now can see how that would be very rewarding work. His new favorite fish to catch is bass, but he wants to go for a trout sometime soon, and so do I. We plan to try Liberty again at least two more times before the season closes for three years.  I also plan to hit Anima-Nip again this weekend with the wife (if my battery will charge up enough) and maybe head south-west to the narrows this time. Never been down that way yet."
618353,Jigger,2011-09-04 12:45:00,1237,"Personally, id rather read a report like yours that tells a story. You might be into small fish now, but you get out often and are bound to get into some quality size and numbers in the future! Always great to share a first with someone, i bet your cousin will be beating down your door to go again!"
618359,splashhopper,2011-09-04 13:31:00,2931,"Excllent report Dana..... I too love seeing someone catching their first fish or being the recipient of someone else teaching me about a new species..   It is reports like yours that I am partial too. Humble, honest and self effacing.  Keep them coming brother.  "
618373,Rod Caster,2011-09-04 14:10:00,5784,"So, no Aurora's?? Haha kidding. Good job putting him on fish! He's gonna consider you his guide from now on. That 16""er is a beauty"
618375,woodenboater,2011-09-04 14:21:00,2277,great to read your cuz finally got to bring in some bass and some nice ones at that !
618393,adolson,2011-09-04 16:18:00,783,"Thanks guys!  I managed to record a little bit of video of him catching his first bass, but he didn't want me to share it with anyone. I'm not sure why, but he gets really excited and he talks to the fish. I think at one point he calls it a ""son of a beehive"" which, well, I don't know what that means... Haha. Anyhow, I'll respect his wishes.   Haha, not yet, but we both want one, so we're gonna try some more... I don't understand why they're so hard to catch when we're doing everything right as far as I know. I have a good feeling about September, though!"
618402,manitoubass2,2011-09-04 17:11:00,11391,"awesome report Dana! You have an awesome sense of humor s well  Fish are fish, and looks like an excellent outing!  In due time, I'm sure you'll be posting pics of some monstrous fish, and the more time on the water, the better the chances.  Good on ya for hookin' up your cuz"
618405,MCTFisher9120,2011-09-04 17:22:00,3761,"Sounds like fun, congrads to the both of you for gettin out and having fun!  Thanks for sharing,  MTBF"
618519,Roy,2011-09-05 09:55:00,13728,A true report. You're getting some quality time out there Dana. Enjoy all of it that you can. Thanks.
618524,Darrel,2011-09-05 10:50:00,82,"I enjoyed your post and the history of your story, including your cousin...Adam, as you call him, lmao!!! Love to see anglers having fun with the sport of fishing and not taking it so seriously for the catch and kill! LOL. Thanks for sharing!!!"
618543,lunkerbasshunter,2011-09-05 12:51:00,2585,fun report to read!  good on you guys for getting out.  I have not been on the water since the last week of July so I am super jealous.  I do have some fall fishing coming my way though and can't wait!  cheers!
618803,mercman,2011-09-06 02:46:00,7054,Nice outing Dana You musta been grinning ear to ear when your cousin caught those smallies. Way to go!!!  Paul
618813,limeyangler,2011-09-06 03:13:00,5204,Pretty damn excellent report IMHO.  I also know what you mean about being as happy as the guy who cuaght it...good feeling helping someone out.  Keep the reports coming Dana...who gives a sh^% about 400 ten foot muskies in 20 minutes anyway...not what fishing is about anyway in my book.
618834,Musky or Specks,2011-09-06 11:18:00,2710,Dana nice report and good job getting another hooked on the sport Your learning pretty fast.
618976,johnnyb,2011-09-06 18:55:00,3413,"Honestly, that's a great report    It's awesome to see how excited you were for him to catch a REAL fish....and the action shot of his hookset is awesome  Keep paying attention to the details, like what's on the gameboy, and you will catch more and bigger fish.  For northern smallie lakes that often produce small ones, I find that putting a heavier lure on and vertical jigging in the deep water can pay off....don't be afraid of 30, 40, even 50 feet of water....put a heavy tube jig, spoon, or rattlin rap on, let it hit bottom and rip it up a few feet.  See what happens"
618981,TJQ,2011-09-06 19:04:00,7806,Nothing wrong with that post.. ya got more fishing in than I did this weekend!!
