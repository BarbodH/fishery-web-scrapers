We have met quite a few of you, and made alot of friends from this forum and i'm sure alot of you would like to extend a happy birthday to him aswell. I whole heartly appreciate everything he has done for me over the years and I'm sure alot of you have appreciated going out fishing with him aswell. I hope you have a great day dad, too bad i couldn't be home enjoying it with you, but i'll try my best to catch a nice walleye for you, so we can have a nice fish fry in a couple weeks. hope its a great day  well talk soon, cheers  sean aka pikeslayer jr."
