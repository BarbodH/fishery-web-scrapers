619090,Joey,2011-09-07 00:23:00,9122,"Was so great seeing you Jim and your wonderful family.  I had never met or had a chance to talk with Sue before and had a great time getting to know her     She's great!!!  Glad we had great few days enjoying your company and were thrilled you got that beauty muskie.  As you know our plans were to take us to LSC this week, but the wind Gods would have none of that.  After two days of trying to decide what to do, we will be heading back up to Lakair for the remander of our holiday, but in a cabin this time  C'mon up and join us if you want, we got the big one with the fire pit so lots of extra room  Cheers,  Joey"
619096,mistyriver1,2011-09-07 00:40:00,600," Joey, it was great having you and Paul as neighbours!! We enjoyed having you guys there.  You made a good call in leaving when you guys did cause Saturday was wet and Sunday ended up being windy and cold.  Sue had an an unfortunate run in with a bees nest on our site (you know where the telephone pole is..) she ended up getting stung about 25 times  .  She's Ok, but still shooken up....pretty sure we are going to be changing sites going forward."
619098,Joey,2011-09-07 00:43:00,9122,"OMG Jim, that is awful about Sue.  Glad she's okay (well as okay as she can be).  That many stings can be serious stuff.  I'll have to keep that in mind awell"
619101,Whopper,2011-09-07 00:49:00,2174,"Good stuff Jim except the bee stings for Sue.  Beauty fish your hoisting, glad you had a good time and had some fine neighbors.  Thanks for sharing"
619105,mercman,2011-09-07 00:55:00,7054,"Great pics, and what a nice Ski I wish i lived closer to some of you guys. Would love to meet a few of you for sure  Thanks for the report."

619160,ehg,2011-09-07 02:45:00,2666,Very nice musky Amazing how these Bald Eagles are showing up in reports from across the province this year.  Thanks for the post.
619173,Stef,2011-09-07 04:22:00,63,"Living here, I can add a few pictures...  Osprey leaving it's perch    Bald Eagle (fuzzy shot but the best I've got so far)    Golden eagle on perch    Loon    And a sunset (Don't get up early enough for sunrises, I'm retired)  "
619175,Rich Clemens,2011-09-07 09:20:00,3131,"Ah yes.   Sunrise, sunset, and everything else in between.  Can't wait to get back up there ... will have to for a while yet.   Great to see you caught one too.   Seems like the big girls out there are hungry this year.  Paul/Joey ... your turn !!!!!!"
619180,lew,2011-09-07 10:23:00,12766,"Congrats on a very nice fish Jim, and the pics & videos turned out great. Really enjoyed the eagle/osprey encounter.  As I told you on the phone last night, I darned near came back up for another week but just had too much doing around here.  Scary stuff with Sue & the bee's too but it sounds like she got over it OK.  Oh yeah, the boat looks real good in Joey's picture too"
619181,lew,2011-09-07 10:51:00,12766,"I was able to straighten the picture Jim, but had to lose your hat & part of the tail to do it.  "
619186,fishindevil,2011-09-07 11:27:00,6254,nice fish jim !!! and real pretty country up there ...cheers
619238,misfish,2011-09-07 16:39:00,29133,Nice fish Jim.Congrats.
619262,Fish4Eyes,2011-09-07 17:45:00,1022,Nice haul Jim. Was the bee's nest at your usual camp spot across from the hump spot?
619266,johnnyb,2011-09-07 17:50:00,3413,There's a hump spot at Lakair?!  Okay now I KNOW I'll get the wife to go
619270,mistyriver1,2011-09-07 18:00:00,600,"Thanks for the replies folks.  Lew- it would have been great to see you up there.  As I said last night, we'll probably switch it to the time you guys are going up next year.  I still haven't fished in that Skeeter of yours yet, I want u to net another 50 for me   You and I have pretty good luck when we go out together, we've only been skunked once and that was cause of that hail storm !!!  Ned-  Yeah we were in our usual spot.  We were kind of wondering if we might see you guys last week."
619275,rufus,2011-09-07 18:12:00,267,Great muskie! Terrific pictures too!
