618840,Rod Caster,2011-09-06 12:00:00,5784," Haha, not anymore. That move alone brought our  house prices up 5 percent. I think they moved the bible store to the main strip."
618852,TJQ,2011-09-06 12:41:00,7806,"Great place to live. nice small city, 3 hours from toronto, 4 hours from ottawa, 1 hour 15min from sudbury, 4.5 hours from the sault. (3 hours to matachewan) It really is the gateway to the north. Great schools, a bit of culture, 2 malls, lotsa new stores, home depot etc... oh ya and lake nipissing!!"
618892,Musky or Specks,2011-09-06 14:42:00,2710,Im one of those that consider anything south of 17 Southern Ontario. If its northern Ontario it has to be north of 17
618896,Nipfisher,2011-09-06 14:56:00,2449,Hwy. 17 cuts North Bay in half. I am below it so I live in Southern ontario?

618946,Fish4Eyes,2011-09-06 17:36:00,1022,"I'm not from the area, but to help you in your decision, North Bay is home to a nursing school dude. Imagine that pub night. You could choose which one will rape you"
618228,Muskieman,2011-09-03 16:52:00,2472, Congrats!!!     Go have a beer !!
618229,bushart,2011-09-03 16:56:00,2628,OK advice from someone who has moved around lots  1st thing I learned--asking most folks that reside in any given place---probably be a positive answer  Most folks hate to admit they may live in a place others would not.  And before anybody jumps---I like North Bay  2nd Are you only going for the job or the sport----If your job folds---Then What??  Like others have said---not tons of opportunity on your doorstep  How do you feel about longer winters and blackflies?  Some small towns (N Bay??may not be small) can be cliquey---they see lots of folks come and go---hard to make new friends  I'm not trying to talk you out of it---but we've lived from southern--eastern---central and northwestern Ontario--seen lots
618249,livinisfishin,2011-09-03 20:30:00,661, Some great stuff to think about thanks.  Im from a smaller town with less opportunity in my opinion. So to me this ist a step up. Longer winters not so nice but ill deal with it because of the experience i will get from this job as opposed to the one i am currently in. The biggest factor for me is money. I will be making a bit more but not enough to offset my cost of living. I will be going from living with my parents to full out on my own..that is the scary part.
618257,bushart,2011-09-03 21:01:00,2628,Is this a move from your folks to a new town on your own--1st time out of the house?  That'll be a challenge on several fronts
618258,livinisfishin,2011-09-03 21:04:00,661, Yes it is my first move. Im aware of most of the challenges but I definitely could be overlooking some things.
618267,bushart,2011-09-03 21:37:00,2628,If your moving far from home and on your own  You are leaving a support system behind---if your prepared ok  My only advice----make a pro and con list and be honest  There's fishin in lots of places  Best of Luck
618287,Musky or Specks,2011-09-04 00:47:00,2710,One Word... FANNIES!!!
618288,danc,2011-09-04 00:49:00,4677, But.... if you like fishing it's not such a bad place.
618307,livinisfishin,2011-09-04 03:53:00,661,I have until Monday night to decide if I'm going through with this or not. Right now I am leaning towards going based on the experience that I can get.
618311,Stef,2011-09-04 04:47:00,63,"I've moved around a lot in my former career as well.  It gets harder as you get older with more stuff, family issues like school changes, etc..  My advice, if it will help your work, go for it.  You need to get out on your own anyway and leave the nest, its time.  North Bay is a great area, watch your finances and get a place to rent you can afford (I don't presume you'll be buying).  You'll develop friends from work, recreational activities and clubs quickly enough.  Be outgoing and friendly and you'll get that back in return.  This is the point in your life where you start to make things happen for yourself, looks like you're on your way...."
618312,Rod Caster,2011-09-04 06:13:00,5784,"Congrats! You'll like North Bay, most people do. Its only 4 hrs from hell but it gets quite cold. To be honest, its not as  isolated of a place as some people seem to think, so chances are you won't feel that way once you move here. Best of luck, I'll see you around!"
618314,adolson,2011-09-04 06:49:00,783," I forgot how close it was to Toronto.   You misspelled ""mayflies.""   (pic from wikipedia page. I took this pic in North Bay. there's a truck underneath all that. gross.)"
618343,pikehunter,2011-09-04 12:04:00,1659,West Arm Rider Nailed it! Never be afraid of a little adventure into the unknown. Some times great things can happen. Remember it;'s easier to be a big fish in a small pond.  Congrats on the new job! 
618347,woodenboater,2011-09-04 12:22:00,2277,"I think this is a move you need to make if you take the long picture. Gaining new work AND life experiences is what it's all about. When I was around 18, I left the Centre of the Universe , aka Hell, for work in London, Ont.. Big change for a big city kid. Loved it totally and in hindsight, am surprised my parents didn't get all clucky about their youngest kid leaving and besides, you'll always have a home to go back to no matter where you are.  North Bay wouldn't be too bad a place from the times I've visited there and the year round recreational opportunities available would be rather enviable. Being soooo close to the West Arm and the French would clinch it for me if I were in your shoes.  Lastly, there's always the community here at OFCN to lean on if the transition hits a few rough patches.   WB"
618395,daryl0815,2011-09-04 16:34:00,225,"Interesting thread I have always wondered about North Bay as well, I sometimes apply for jobs near there that are posted where I work, it is one of the less obscure places on the list! i.e. Kapuskasing, Barrett Chute, Atikokan, Ear Falls etc. I always apply just for the hell of it, if I ever got a job offer, I might have to think about it though!  I have driven through North Bay and it seemed nice enough, like lots of people here have said. It seemed like a big town/small town feel at the same time, I think it would not be such a hard transition from the GTA.  On a similar note, has anyone lived/had experience near Kincardine/Port Elgin? I have a job offer there that I am thinking about, but I don't think I want to leave the company I am with right now."
618403,bushart,2011-09-04 17:12:00,2628,Ask Twocoda  I believe they get 100 feet of snow in the winter
618404,daryl0815,2011-09-04 17:17:00,225,"   Yes I have heard that also, and the snow comes down sideways!"
618466,NAW,2011-09-05 00:33:00,4022,Congrets on the job offer!  I was just lookin forward to going perchin with ya.
618467,irishfield,2011-09-05 00:36:00,26272,"Jesus Jason... they get less snow in the 'Bay then we do here in Penetang, you got your bags packed yet???"
618477,livinisfishin,2011-09-05 01:15:00,661,No worries nick I've had a change of pace..for now. I've had to turn down the offer ..reason being I have a few monthes of debt to pay off and then ill be able to look at a much better apartment aswell as give myself some time to find something a little more local. Up north would be great but all in good time.  Thanks for all the support guys and sorry for wasting your time.
618486,pikehunter,2011-09-05 02:03:00,1659, Not a worry and not a waste of time. Like most here I'm glad to get my 2 cents worth in. Best of luck and 2 thumbs  up for making a decision.
618495,bushart,2011-09-05 02:46:00,2628,I'm very happy you made the call based on reasoning and not emotion.  All in Time
618503,blarg,2011-09-05 03:25:00,289,"No offense but the idea that some people consider North Bay as ""up north"" is amusing, says something about how southern Ontario centric some people are, o wait, North bay should technically be considered southern Ontario, and it isn't that cold here nor does it snow all that much, at least not compared to most of Canada.  That would be the probably 90 percent of the country further north than North Bay, we are actually further south than Seattle Washington, which is obviously further south than all of western Canada.  North bay is a nice place to live, but then some people think the constant suburb south of Barrie is something special, to each his own, crazy people need a place to live too."
618509,Nipfisher,2011-09-05 04:48:00,2449,"  Ya blarg, we are not that North. It is a great place to live and very central to the rest of Ontario."
618540,lunkerbasshunter,2011-09-05 12:43:00,2585,"my wife is from the BAY and her family is still up there.  Outdoors paridise if you ask me.  You can go any direction and find hundreds and hundreds of lakes to fish, boat play in.  People are pretty friendly up there.  Winters are harsh but buy a sled and a good fish hut and problem solved.  If i had work up there I would move there in a heartbeat  Cheers!"
617931,livinisfishin,2011-09-02 00:58:00,661,Is it a nice place to live? A place where a young guy like myself may want to settle down?
617932,NAW,2011-09-02 01:02:00,4022,Only been there a few times.  I was wondering the same thing though.  Great group of OFC'ers from North Bay.  I'm sure they'll all give some input.  One good thing...  It's close to Lakair!
617937,livinisfishin,2011-09-02 01:10:00,661,I've often thought about going to lakair for the get together..I've been on here for a couple years now and still haven't met anyone.
617944,Terry,2011-09-02 01:27:00,14456,"I heard the only thing that ever came out of North Bay was hookers and hockey players      Hey my wife is from there         OH, What team does she play on    LOL"
617948,NAW,2011-09-02 01:34:00,4022, Her'd they come right out to your ice huts in the winter.  Maybe they'll skate out in the right conditions!  I ain't talkin about the Hockey players...
617964,Rod Caster,2011-09-02 02:47:00,5784,Kraft Hockeyville winners... We make good Mac and Sleeze
617974,Nipfisher,2011-09-02 03:28:00,2449,"  Really depends on what kind of work you expect to get. Great city close to 1000s of lakes and lots of out door recreation. However, you can't do much with out some cash. Feel free to PM me with any specific questions."
617977,Nipfisher,2011-09-02 03:31:00,2449, By the way Terry that is Kirkland Lake they say that about. At least Allan Thicke did.
617983,adolson,2011-09-02 04:34:00,783,"Ah, North Bay... I lived there for about 6 years, and I liked it well enough. I can tell you the best restaurants for almost any type of food, and you can trust it since I am a fat guy.  I miss a couple friends I made there, and it's nice when bands I know show up there. In the years I lived there, Alice Cooper and UnderOath both played there, but I didn't get to go. Then last year, La Dispute and Norma Jean played and I did get to go (odd, since I no longer lived there, heh).  I almost had to move (was looking at Ottawa) after losing my IT job with the telemarketing company / hell there and couldn't find any work for several months. But then I got hired by the local ISP (Vianet) and that saved the day. I have a lot of fond memories of North Bay, and I would go back there if I wanted to move again (I don't). I like where I'm at now, for the most part.  I really regret not fishing there much at all while I lived there. The only fish I caught were some gross catfish - that's probably why I didn't fish more.. I should have got out more, bought a cheap canoe, etc. If I lived there now, you can bet I'd be out fishing with some other OFCers as much as I could. There's not many people that I know of around here (Tri-Towns) who like fishing enough to go even weekly, let alone register for a fishing forum or - gosh - go two days in a row.."
617989,Terry,2011-09-02 09:43:00,14456, I think Allan stole that line from me  only I use to say it about Keswick........
618010,Rod Caster,2011-09-02 12:16:00,5784,"If you love the big city you won't like North Bay. Having said that I don't anyone would be in long term shock by moving here from the city... I mean how much cultural stuff/traffic/congestion/restaurants/clothing shops/annoying radio stations does anyone really need. This is normal life canada with access to a lot of crown land.  Once you get to know Nipfisher, you'll essentially have accesss to everyone within 100kms of North Bay. I consider him the mayor."
618018,Bernie,2011-09-02 12:54:00,3190,"Great place to live, but tough to make a living. There are openings for skilled trade guys, but skilled is a key factor.  I live in a small town 35 km south of North bay, would not live anywhere else."

Just the other day I drove past a quadriplegic clinic and they had a sign on the door that said ""Walk Ins Welcome"".
