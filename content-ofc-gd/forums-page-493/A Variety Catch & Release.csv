To some smartbasses out there who ASSume that this newbie(me) to this site, is a newbie to fishing. Ya got it all wrong!!! If ya read my posts clearly, you would have noticed that I am new to the Hamilton area fishing game, not new to fishing. So before you start judging someone ya don't know, why not try asking before persecuting!!!  Anywayzzzzz, now I've made myself quite clear, I have an update of my adventure at Binbrook today. I finally landed a pike this season, but not before a smallie took a bite of my minnow half way into my first cast of the day.  Upon releasing the little gaffer, I wet my line another four times before I would feel another strike. ""This was the one!"" I thought to myself and sure enough, it was! I watched my bobber dive, I set the hook and began to reel. It felt like a heavy drag at first, so I let drift, then began to reel again. There was not much action until I saw it veer its ugly mug right at me, about 8' from shore, then it took action! Flipping itself right outta the water to reverse its direction, it took a deep plunge for a getaway. I let it drag for a couple of seconds, then I retaliated with a vigorous reeling and another half a second drag, then one more quick tug, landing my fist pike upon the rocky shore. A quick photo and weigh-in of just 3lbs, I then reached for my pliers to unhook and release the small game for another day.  After releasing the pike, about an hour would pass before I would feel my next strike, which felt like another pike, but quite a bit larger. Oh it was larger alright, but far from a pike and a a much better fight actually! I landed a 6lb catfish! I couldn't even fit it in the photo from head to tail.  After releasing the catfish, it would take me into the latter part of the afternoon to finish my day with another smallie that was full of piss & vinegar, which wasn't worth weighing, but well worth the fight! Although the smallie lost the battle, pound for pound, the best wrestler of the day!!!  It was a nice way for me to finish my summer season. Now I can't wait until my break at Thanksgiving to get out in the cooler weather to land some feisty, bigger pike! Thanks to everyone for the tips on where to catch some pike! Binbrook was good to me!!!"
618708,manitoubass2,2011-09-05 22:54:00,11391,"Nice! Looks like you had a great day.  I've never caught a catfish, so I am jealous"
618711,Darrel,2011-09-05 23:04:00,82," Well I wish you luck with landing a catfish; well worth a good fight. And sorry, I didn't have the photos uploaded properly, but I do now. Newbies eh?  :rofl2:"
618712,MCTFisher9120,2011-09-05 23:07:00,3761,Nice story Hamilton guy  Keep the report's coming!  MTBF
618719,Darrel,2011-09-05 23:25:00,82, Thanks...and will do!!!
618724,vinnimon,2011-09-05 23:49:00,2593,"The bass and pike I did expect, but as for the kitty That surprised me for that size The bass i catch are in the hot times of the season and they are big. Im surprised that no crappie were caught.In good faith here is something Ive been dealing with for a while, frustrating but fun as well. Cant find the pic but im sure this will intice you, pic is a little crappy though. "

618859,Darrel,2011-09-06 13:00:00,82,"Are crappies a good fight? And yes, the catfish I caught today was huge!!! Good fight too!!!     "
618864,Live2fish85,2011-09-06 13:16:00,1633,"Nice job. Loooks like you had a good day out fishing. As for the crappie being good fighters, not really they are a aggressive scrappy little fish but pan fish. They are good to eat but I wouldn't eat them from Binbrook. They had a water problem before but I'm not sure its fixed or are working to make it better."
618866,manitoubass2,2011-09-06 13:29:00,11391," Crappies are pretty scrappy, but not really a good fight. Very fun though on light tackle when you get into em good. Find a school and you can catch huge quantities . Very tasty too!   "
618868,Garry2Rs,2011-09-06 13:32:00,1425,"If you want big Cat's in that area head for Dunnville or Port Maitland. You can fish from shore at both places, but a boat obviously gives you more options. Garry2rs"
618884,Darrel,2011-09-06 14:17:00,82,"I know a great spot for crappies, but not givin' it up; I just never thought much of reeling for them. I know they're good eatin', but that's not part of my game! The more I pull out and don't put back, the less I have to catch tomorrow  It's all about the relaxation for me; much like golf. I don't care how well I play the game as long as I'm having fun playing it.... Although it's nice to land a few!!! LOL.  I'm Originally from London and you can catch tons of catties , outta the Thames River, but like Binbrook, not worth keeping, let alone eating My older bro reports to me all the time from there, about his fishing expeditions. Here is a rare species of the sucker family he caught the other day in London; The Redhorse Sucker. I think it's a very pretty fish actually, for a sucker, lol. "
618889,Darrel,2011-09-06 14:37:00,82," Hey LiveToFish85  I see you're from the Creek as well as I am. If ya ever need a buddy to tag along for a fishing excursion, ya know how to find me. Any message you send, defaults right to my Blackberry, so no message goes unturned   -Darrel-"
618908,Rod Caster,2011-09-06 15:19:00,5784," I've never seen that type of fish before. You are right, it's quite a nice looking species...are you 100% it's a redhorse sucker?"
618939,Fish4Eyes,2011-09-06 17:06:00,1022," In April and May they are consistently big, not so much now. Lots of smaller ones in the summer I have found over the years."
619141,Darrel,2011-09-07 02:09:00,82," Ummm, yes!!! LOL.

619142,Darrel,2011-09-07 02:12:00,82," Well, for my first catfish ever, I found it pretty big, compared to any I've seen my brothers catch in London."
