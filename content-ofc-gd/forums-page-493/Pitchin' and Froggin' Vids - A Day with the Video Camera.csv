618786,JustinHoffman,2011-09-06 02:09:00,482,"Hello All,  Decided to shoot a couple of short vids a few weeks back when out in the boat. Was fishing solo so had to rely on the tripod and hope that the action was always in the shot. Was a fun experience and will definitely be shooting more this fall. Enjoy...  Pitchin' For Bass:     Froggin' The Slop:     Good Fishing,  Justin"
618793,nroadrunner,2011-09-06 02:20:00,113,"nice job,  only problem was they need to be longer LOL    Ian"
618795,JustinHoffman,2011-09-06 02:30:00,482,"Good suggestion, Ian. If the action had been more steady they would have been much longer! haha! Will shoot longer versions over the next few weeks - or at least edit a bunch of clips together for a longer ""episode.""  Glad you enjoyed them...  Good Fishing,  Justin"
618802,ccmtcanada,2011-09-06 02:45:00,7971,Really enjoyed watching those!  Thanks for posting them Justin!
618816,fishindude,2011-09-06 04:22:00,220,"Nice vids there! Lovin the angle, can't wait to see some of those autumn footballs on deck"
618819,tb4me,2011-09-06 05:40:00,3295,I enjoyed those video's. The less yappin the better IMOO some fishing shows on tv I cant stand all the talking in between fish..Your sielence is golden!
618824,solopaddler,2011-09-06 09:37:00,8605,Nice dude. You even managed to get the loons to sing on cue in the 2nd one.
618914,335396,2011-09-06 15:24:00,16,"Enjoyed the video, thanks."
618926,EC1,2011-09-06 16:12:00,930,Really cool video! Your frogging presentation is damn fast!
619006,fishermccann,2011-09-06 19:48:00,655,"Thanks for that , wonderful!"
619023,Terry,2011-09-06 20:30:00,14456,great videos  looks like a tv show to me
619040,206,2011-09-06 21:44:00,563,Great video's....real life fishing sometime you go for what seems forever between fish and then too they are not all monsters.  Most these T.V shows get a few days fishing into 1/2 hour with all the hogs.
619061,manitoubass2,2011-09-06 22:59:00,11391,"I liked the silence as well. Damn, thats a reaction strike presentation! lol, beauty of fishing the frog though, slow, fast, splash etc all get hits.  Loved the quality as well, I'd watch these all day long!"
619064,MJL,2011-09-06 23:11:00,2427,"Really cool video Justin.  I'm not really into bass fishing but being able to see everything from the approach, the cast, the technique used, the strike and capture made it all very entertaining and educational (at least for me)...I have to admit, seeing the fish boil on the lure through the slop was pretty exciting - And I wasn't even fishing.LOL"
619128,JustinHoffman,2011-09-07 01:44:00,482,"Thanks for the kind comments, guys - much appreciated. Will be shooting more video this weekend. Will try to get some different tactics on tape and get some longer clips put together. Bit of a learning curve here but it sure is enjoyable  Good Fishing,  Justin"
619156,johnnyb,2011-09-07 02:36:00,3413,"Just a tip...I noticed that when you're pitching, you would start going really really fast....but every time you slowed down, you seemed to catch a fish   Great videos....keep'em coming!"
619383,manjo39,2011-09-08 00:03:00,354,  Nice.  I enjoyed watching them.
619384,manjo39,2011-09-08 00:05:00,354,  How do you find the durability of the money craw?
