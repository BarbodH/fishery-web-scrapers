617981,Canuck2fan,2011-09-02 04:28:00,1444,It was a pretty good season opener... Willie got bitten soaked the wound in iodine and peroxide lit up another smoke and went right after a 10 footer with a treble hook. One of the new guys went out after dark and was hand catching gators (almost identical to the size of the one that bit Willie) to tag them. Don't see that kind of stuff on your other reality shows. Seeing the gravy recipe being handed down was great too.
617988,Grimace,2011-09-02 09:40:00,2020,"  Bravo Sir, Bravo!!1  I could not agree more."
618000,Daplumma,2011-09-02 11:05:00,1961,  That was a rerun.No wonder it wasn't on down here.We are waiting on season three down here. Joe

619026,bubbles,2011-09-06 20:42:00,591,  That's a tree eater!!!  I think that is the one that cost Willie most of his teeth.
619028,mercman,2011-09-06 20:45:00,7054,   I'm surprised they dont shoot themselves or a hole in the boat.Pretty scvarey watching them swing that rifle all over the place.
619397,mercman,2011-09-08 00:36:00,7054,"Dont forget, 10pm tonite, History channel. Troy Landry and his son Jacob try a new honey hole where there may be many huge gators."

613166,livinisfishin,2011-08-18 02:06:00,661,I've seen the commercials for that show. I will be checking it out for sure!
613178,lookinforwalleye,2011-08-18 02:55:00,4399,Long awaited by whom???
613179,mike rousseau,2011-08-18 02:57:00,4661,  ME!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
613181,lookinforwalleye,2011-08-18 03:04:00,4399,  Have fun!!!
613203,mercman,2011-08-18 10:54:00,7054,  Come on LFW......We Know you are a closet swamp person. Free your soul and come on out of the closet man.
613208,lookinforwalleye,2011-08-18 11:16:00,4399,"Sorry bud not my cup of tea there is so much trash on TV these days it has me wanting to watch less and less, this week I have watched about one hour!  The bachelor,bachelette,bachelor pad  dancing with the stars,toddlers and tiera`s,real house wifes,kardasians etc.etc. I mean come on.  For the life of me I can not see why any halfway inteligent person would sit down and watch any of it!  My wife spends 6-7 hours a day watch this mindless tripe"
613212,danbouck,2011-08-18 11:48:00,4380, Aint nothing wrong with that show!
613213,mercman,2011-08-18 11:50:00,7054," I banned those channels from my TV years ago.I watch WFN, History,Discovery, NatGeo, OLN, and That other Channel with the Bunny Rabbits on it. Oh ya, and the CBC for Coronation Street."
613218,woodenboater,2011-08-18 12:24:00,2277,"Actually, Swamp People is a pretty good show. Yeah there's lots of 'drama and near misses', but for reality shows, it does get into the cultural roots/way of life  that gator hunters have and that this is the only life they know. Having been down there just after Katrina, I'm amazed that people continue to live and work in an area that may very well get hammered again. I thought it would be pure drivel but it's a better watch than Deadliest Catch imo."
613219,bigugli,2011-08-18 12:31:00,6138,"When it first aired I was surprised. Folks there may be hospitable, but tend to keep their affairs quiet. Honest, upfront, hard working folk. A lot like the folks down east that work the lobster lines. Network must have sprung a lot of coin to get the boys to open up and show the way of life they've always known."
613226,Roy,2011-08-18 12:50:00,13728," It's no surprise as these people are the descendants of Acadian men (Cajuns) mostly from Nova Scotia, deported toward Louisiana in 1755."
613274,richyb,2011-08-18 15:49:00,774,A couple of weeks back i watched a marathon of swamp people with new people ( 2 old guys with beards and 2 native guys with an air boat that looked like they had money) I think it was on history but cant remember. I watched most of season one and dont remember these guys. Maybe they played the marathon and now are going to start showing them 1 at a time ?
613280,wallyboss,2011-08-18 16:22:00,1095,"I watched an episode this week and 2 guys went out one night to try to catch Poachers that were stealing their gators. They just missed them.  Not a bad show, but I wouldn't be able to watch a marathon of it:)"
613642,Stern Rules,2011-08-19 17:27:00,342,I could watch that all day. Can't quite get into Python Hunters though.
613810,Billy Bob,2011-08-20 10:40:00,5865,I LOVED the first season but now with the new characters I just couldn't get into this time......but ENJOY......
617558,Daplumma,2011-08-31 23:02:00,1961,Its not on tonite unless I'm missing something. Joe
617559,irishfield,2011-08-31 23:08:00,26272,"Bring back Leave it To Beaver... so I can hear once again ""Don't you think you were a little hard on the Beaver last night Ward?"" !"
617561,Handlebarz,2011-08-31 23:09:00,3790,just started to watch the show it is good so far but only saw a couple episodes.
