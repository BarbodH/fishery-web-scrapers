618903,young_one,2011-09-06 15:16:00,620,"Hit a massive ditch while towing the boat back. Uneven trailer axle made the brake on the outside wheel unaligned. Was driving with smokes and sparks until warned by other friendly motorists.  Need a reliable repair shop as soon as possible.  Any recommendation? My boat is parked near Bloomington and HWY404, with the broken brake I don't think I can go very far.  Thanks"
