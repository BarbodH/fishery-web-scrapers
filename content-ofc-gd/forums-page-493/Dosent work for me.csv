619346,Rod Caster,2011-09-07 22:31:00,5784," As an original Jets fan turned Coyotes fan I'm hoping for the Coyotes to relocate to Quebec. I'm happy to see the Jets return but I don't think Winnipeg could generate a successful team given the arena size, their geographic location and their salary limitations. So I'll stay with the Coyotes for now in anticipation that they might move to QC.  My crazy theory is that Bettman approved the Jets so he could throw it back in Canada's face when they start hemorraging money, therefore making it unlikely that we see another team here any time soon. We all know he knows we hate him. Hamilton or Quebec are much better hockey markets than Winnipeg."
619007,misfish,2011-09-06 19:50:00,29133,Jets came out with thier new look.      http://news.ca.msn.com/top-stories/winnipeg-jets-unveil-new-jerseys
619010,manitoubass2,2011-09-06 19:58:00,11391,"I actually like the new look.  I would have strongly preferred the original over anything, but with business in mind, it wouldn't make much sense."
619011,davey buoy,2011-09-06 19:59:00,5505,"Not me either,but like everything else by the end of the season we won't even notice.Probably?"
619016,misfish,2011-09-06 20:12:00,29133, Wouldnt pissed the Leafs fan off if they won the cup first year back.LOL
619022,NAW,2011-09-06 20:29:00,4022,I don't mind the new uni..  They could have done a better job though I think.
619029,Rod Caster,2011-09-06 20:46:00,5784,"A good simple design, like the originals. Sure beats the Wild's jersey."
619032,Familyfisherman,2011-09-06 20:59:00,188,"It is simple...but rather boring.  They also paid $1m to the air force didn't they to have the logo?  I like the idea of giving money to the airforce, but it hardly seems necessary to have a boring logo...?  Most hockey fans won't even get the connection between the Jets and having the Air Force located there...  Overall the reaction has been negative from what I've heard...I agree with the majority...boring...  I'd have gone with the original logo and just changed the colours up a bit to sell more jerseys...  M 2 cents anyways."
619033,Roy,2011-09-06 21:10:00,13728,"Up until now I didn't know what it took to be a hockey fan. Now I know. You need a critical eye for men's apparel, colour and be acutely aware of fashion. Who cares how they play, right?"
619036,206,2011-09-06 21:24:00,563,I'm hoping for their 3rd jersey to be a Retro Jets uni
619068,phatpelkey,2011-09-06 23:26:00,78,i like both the new and old but would prefer the old more!
619109,Whitespinnerbait,2011-09-07 00:58:00,2038,Its all a Marketing Scheme............everbody will rush out and by the jersey...........come mid season the Management will change the Logo............everbody will rush out and by the new ' lOOK  ' jersey  etc etc   $$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$
619115,Terry,2011-09-07 01:17:00,14456,"would it be better if they had a bit of nascar on the shirt      <a href=""http://s25.photobucket.com/albums/c52/Mrbeee1954/?action=view&current=yy-4.jpg"" target=""_blank""><img src=""http://i25.photobucket.com/albums/c52/Mrbeee1954/yy-4.jpg"" border=""0"" alt=""Photobucket""></a>"
619172,hawk-eye,2011-09-07 03:59:00,141,I like it.
619201,lhousesoccer,2011-09-07 12:31:00,442,"Here's what someone posted in the comment section of a CBC online article announcing the new logo.  It's their opinion, not mine, but I thought this person brought up some interesting points ....  QUOTE  It's a terrible logo and an even worse uniform.  1. There is something seriously wrong when a hockey logo has nothing to do with hockey.  2. It is a stretch to try to link this to 17 Wing. There are no jets there.  3. The old Jets logo had a commercial jet – not a military one. So this link to the team's tradition and the military is phoney and forced.  4. There is something seriously wrong with marketing a weapon of mass destruction to people who will be buying these for their CHILDREN to wear. And something seriously wrong with parents who will buy them.  5. The logo looks almost exactly like the RCAF roundel. That's not only unoriginal – it's plagiarism.  6. The logo itself has no obvious relation to the city of Winnipeg. There is nothing unique about using a jet; there are other cities and towns in Canada with military bases that actually have jets on them.  7. The name Winnipeg Jets began with the signing of The Golden Jet, Bobby Hull. Not a military jet.  8. The sweaters themselves are very dull; as many have pointed out, the sleeve stripes are very awkward-looking. The two colours of blue are both very dull and lifeless, giving the overall impression of a monotone colour palette. Where is the flash of red aside from the maple leaf in the logo?  The saving grace is that the 'new/old' retro sweaters will probably be out next year. These ones here will fall by the wayside when fans have a choice between the two.  Sorry, but it's true.  END QUOTE"
619217,blaque,2011-09-07 14:05:00,2419,"I like the look. And i also welcome another canadian team back into the league. Hopefully there are more to come.  If the guy posting on the article above is a resident of Winnipeg.......my response is this:  You were just given the gift of Hockey back into your town, something that probably ripped your heart out when they were taken from you. You now have that back, and you feel the first thing at hand should be to post an 8 point complaint list lol. Really?.........REALLY!?!?!?  If i were in that position i wouldnt care if my guys were dressed in Pink Tutus!!"
619219,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2011-09-07 14:09:00,0,"i'm personally not a fan. i see no reason to militarize a hockey logo, in essence, thus politicizing a hockey logo."
619220,Roy,2011-09-07 14:30:00,13728," HAHAHA Yeah, not like a coyote, a bruin, a leaf, a wing, a flame etc etc..."
619226,lhousesoccer,2011-09-07 15:20:00,442," I didn't say ALL his points were valid   .  Here's the link to the CBC story.  His comments (and over 300 others) are below the article.  http://www.cbc.ca/sports/hockey/story/2011/09/06/mb-nhl-jets-jerseys-.html  And I agree with you, Blaque.  It's awesome to finally have a 7th NHL team back in Canada.  Here's hoping the Nordiques make it 8!!"
619228,manitoubass2,2011-09-07 15:26:00,11391,"Seems to me that people in general just love to ""over think"" certain topics.  I'm just stoked Winni has a team again, football is about to start, hockey is coming soon, fall walleye run etc"
619261,bucktail,2011-09-07 17:44:00,1857,4. There is something seriously wrong with marketing a weapon of mass destruction to people who will be buying these for their CHILDREN to wear. And something seriously wrong with parents who will buy them.   Now the jersey may be ugly but its not THAT ugly!!
619289,blaque,2011-09-07 18:53:00,2419, Cheers to the return of the nordiques! Maybe even other cities like Montreal or even Ottawa could make a return to the league eventually as well? (adding Toronto would have been to Cliche')
619306,rufus,2011-09-07 19:36:00,267, Just a couple of corrections.  #5. - Permission was obtained beforehand and the logo is used with the blessing of the Canadian Forces.  #6.- Named after Benny Hatskin's favourite football team -  NY Jets
