616830,mike rousseau,2011-08-29 22:09:00,4661,  most of the remains sink... the only part that floats is what i believe is fatty tissue in the stamoch cavity... seagulls take care of that in seconds...
616844,basketclam,2011-08-29 23:39:00,115,"This got me thinking - it's a question I sure don't know the answer to.  And it seems that people have a lot of ""opinions"".  So I went to the source.  Straight out of the Fisheries Act:  36. (1) No one shall  ( leave or deposit or cause to be thrown, left or deposited, on the shore, beach or bank of any water or on the beach between high and low water mark, remains or offal of fish or of marine animals;  Disposal of remains, etc.  (2) Remains or offal described in subsection (1) may be buried ashore, above high water mark.  I didn't find anything about dumping remains directly in the water.  Maybe someone else would care to take another look."
616849,Canuck,2011-08-29 23:54:00,491,"I slept overnight on the boat in the cove at Beckwith island one night this summer.  I got there just before dark and put down an anchor.  I thought that the water (normally very clean) was kind of ""ripe"" but didn't notice until morning the 10 or so lake trout someone had filetted and dumped in the 5 ft of water.  So much for my start of the day swim.  That is normally pristine water in that cove, but the rotting fish remains really made it awful.  No turtles in that bay either.  If you dump the guts, keep it away from swimming areas or drinking water (remember lots of cottages pull water from the lake)."
616850,mercman,2011-08-29 23:56:00,7054," I know Mike, but if they make it ""OK"", there are those who just throw that stuff every where.I have found fish remains on shore near the launch, and in the water under the dock.I have almost stepped in rotten guts on nunerous occasions, at numerous launches over the years. Where were the gulls and other critters that were sposed to swallow that stuff up? Not all anglers are as courtious as us OFNers There is really no reason to throw fish remains in the water. Look at rivers and lakes as the ""roads"" we use to access our fishing spots. I wouldn't throw garbage of any kind on my roads, i dont throw fish garbage in my waterways either.But thats just me"
616851,misfish,2011-08-29 23:58:00,29133," THANK YOU FRANKTHERABBIT   Ok, heres a ""QUESTION FOR YOU ALL"".  I see Port Credit still has thier fishing cleaning station.Been there for years.Was nice to see last weekend. TRADITION.  This past weekend,I was at the so called ""SALMON PARK""   in Angus. They too,have a fishing cleaning station.  Heres my ""QUESTION""  Where do the remains go? LANDFILL   OMG,WERE TOLD TO COMPOST.HELLO  STUPID LAWS, MAKE STUPID PEOPLE.  We are brought from this earth .We go back in. I DONT SEE THE PROBLEM.   Yes, when we did fish frys on the ice,the remains went back in/down the hole. Back from where it came from.  I dont see the PROBLEM."
616865,mike rousseau,2011-08-30 00:58:00,4661,Crayfish food if you ask me...
616880,dhickey,2011-08-30 01:41:00,1038,We burn the remains. It should be a ballance between common scence and the area your in.? No doubt that stupid people are eveywhere. I also put remaines in the lake but its done properly(cut into pieces and scatterd) I have also put them in flower bedds and gardens.  Ashes to ashes dust to dust..
616882,Stinkbait,2011-08-30 01:47:00,5,I will put mine back in the water...the turtles take care of them pretty quick!
616894,solopaddler,2011-08-30 02:07:00,8605,"On a recent fly in trip with my family to the Chapleau Game Preserve I was disgusted to find piles of rotting fish carcasses all around the camp.  In the water by the beach, on the shore and in the water in several other places near the cabin. Even a pile in the water near the water intake line for the shower/cabin.  A veritable dumping ground.  I spent a good 40 minutes filling 4 pails with rotting carcasses and hauling them over to a nearby island.  The stupidity of some people never ceases to amaze me."
616896,mercman,2011-08-30 02:21:00,7054,"  Its even worse in an Urban Environment, like where i fish.Don't know if its because there are less scavengers, or if they just stay away because of the presence of man"
617125,cjgraham,2011-08-30 18:17:00,104,"Pretty sure discretion is involved pending on the situation. Nothin wrong with feeding the bears, coons eagles, etc. if remote water or bush not a prob. public place? just put them in the trash can. Lets not make it more complictated then it has to be."
617232,misfish,2011-08-30 22:45:00,29133,"  Thats what I meant,yea. Your choice of words were better. TY"
617302,Freshtrax,2011-08-31 03:19:00,2215,I dump them up north when interior camping they sink. Deep water. A few fish here and there is better than bears all over my campsite.. At a cottage i would think there is a better solution.. Bury them.
617329,Billy Bob,2011-08-31 09:53:00,5865,I take them up to the China man (Chinese Restaurant) and he uses them to attract the daily special.......and I get a 20% discount....
617383,Rich,2011-08-31 13:42:00,3927,"I've thrown them in and come back an hour later and they were gone.  On the other side, I threw them off my grandfather's dock once on the Burnt River and they stayed for almost 7 days before we didn't see them anymore. Whether sediment buried them, current took them away or an animal finally found them is beyond me. Thank goodness I wasn't swimming there that week."
618117,northernpike56,2011-09-02 21:50:00,717,"i dunno if its legal or not, but whenever i clean my fish right after ive caught them (not very often), i just put them in a bucket and throw them as far out as i can. I dont think many CO's would bother ticketing you for that considering how many people are doing worse. If anything, your just giving the snapping turtles a free meal!"
618269,GoneFishin,2011-09-03 21:43:00,349,"I'd rather see fish remains in the water then smell them in the garbage  Some people think it's wrong, and it may be illegal, but it's the best way to get rid of them imo. Just be smart about it. Leaving salmon and trout to rot on the shore though should be frowned upon"
618376,Sinker,2011-09-04 14:28:00,8692,"Have you ever seen where commercial fisherman throw the guts after cleaning a boat load?? You got it, right back in the water....all of it!!!  S."
618480,livinisfishin,2011-09-05 01:32:00,661,I agree with the common sense method. That being said I would really hate it if I stepped in a pile of guts and flesh on shore or in the water.
618753,Tootsie II,2011-09-06 01:11:00,162,"My fishing partner has historically always cleaned the fish and the station is thoroughly washed down afterwards. The guts go into a pail and I go out about an eighth of a mile offshore from our campsite and dump them in deep water. They disappear quickly. Back at the landing where we leave our vehicles, people regularly throw them just into the water from the shore and don't clean up their cleaning station very well. Then they wonder why Yogi and his friends come calling. The skeletal remains stay visible in the water for quite a while. The only upside is that we get to see what species they're catching."
619074,phatpelkey,2011-09-06 23:31:00,78,i just double wrap in garbage bag then toss on the next garbage day
619122,chessy,2011-09-07 01:24:00,610,it is not illeagle to throw in river under the MNR they have forwarded me off to the MOE and have talked at length with enforcement officer  waiting to here back from him now ....sept 7 just got a call back from the mnr apparently it is illeagle to do Â if the carcass ever washes ashore you can be charged....
616590,ckrb2007,2011-08-29 02:19:00,449,"People who I talk with around campfires at the trailer park I am a part of have been noticing a lot of fish remains in the water. Full carcasses, minus the fillets, and the skins of the fillets. We weren't sure where they were coming from. Well, today, dad and I were out fishing and I noticed a boat stop, and dump out a 5gallon pail of fish remains, then speed away towards the marina. I was a good distance away so I couldn't say anything but it was clear that it was remains. I'm just wondering if this practice is legal or illegal. There has been quite the bear problem this year so maybe it's a safe way to dispose of them?!?! I dunno.  Cheers, Colin"
616595,mike rousseau,2011-08-29 02:24:00,4661,I dump mine in the river...  I don't think your supposed to... But I don't know what else to do with a bucket of guts...  I just make sure to dump em in deep water far from swimming locations...
616596,ChrisK,2011-08-29 02:26:00,2772,Something smells fishy here. I think there's more than just dumping of fish guts going on...You didn't happen to get a head count on the carcass's in the water did ya ?
616598,Joeytier,2011-08-29 02:26:00,3990,"Legal or not, it's clearly the best way to dispose of them as far as I'm concerned."
616599,ckrb2007,2011-08-29 02:28:00,449," No, unfortunately I didn't nor did I go check them out. I probably should have. They could've been crappie for all i know. I was just curious about the dumping action at this time."
616601,ChrisK,2011-08-29 02:31:00,2772,If anything the turtles will be well fed.
616617,rufus,2011-08-29 03:00:00,267,I did check that out once and as far as I could tell there is no problem with disposing of remains in the water. As I recall the guide explicitly says not to dispose of remains on the shore but makes no mention of chucking them in the water. I generally take mine to the dump anyway except when shore lunches are involved
616618,Roy,2011-08-29 03:03:00,13728,"You'd also have to keep a lot of fish to ""often"" have a bucket of guts."
616624,redskullz,2011-08-29 03:11:00,55,I think the best way is to bury the guts and use the composted dirt for a garden...fish guts/carcasses make awesome fertilizer. I do throw in a few carcasses a tear while camping into weedy backbays where i see snapping turtles....the carcasses dont last long with them around!!
616625,Joeytier,2011-08-29 03:18:00,3990,I keep a bucket in the winter for perch and walleye fillets.  Gotta remember to clean it out before mid-March rolls around...
616631,kickingfrog,2011-08-29 03:42:00,8333,Legal? I don't think so but I don't know.  I do think there is a time and place however.  Remote area and you don't want fish guts (aka bear chanel No 5 ) near your site. I think it's fine to dump the guts far away.  Busy lake with lots of residents and kids swimming. Not going to make you the favorite on the lake.  Lots of grey between those 2 extremes.
616633,dave524,2011-08-29 03:50:00,4508,"On occasion I've seen a good size flock of gulls following commercial fishing tugs on Erie, they appear to be well fed"
616635,ckrb2007,2011-08-29 03:51:00,449," The area where I saw the guy dump it was just outside an area where I fish for largies. This area right now has about 2FOW and is maybe 100-150m away from the trailer park and approx 500m away from the marinas of the lake. So, it's in the busiest areas of the lake but kind of out of the way due to the shallow water."
616636,steelie hunter,2011-08-29 03:53:00,55,"It is illegal. I have seen a few people questioned by CO's while perch fishing on Lake Erie. Not sure if it could be because it contaminates the water even more, being a drinking source and all, but a lot of people do it."
616637,mike rousseau,2011-08-29 03:56:00,4661,If there are turtles around... It's normally gone by morning...  Usually the snapping turtles are into the remains in the boathouse before I'm done cleaning fish... 14-20 minutes...
616641,tb4me,2011-08-29 04:29:00,3295,"The owner of the resort we stay at in the summer, dumps his fish houe gut pail in the bay every morning..The turtles love it and they love it there..He asks us to sererate the garbage from the guts. The plus side to this is, you get to see tons of turtles of all sorts."
616642,adolson,2011-08-29 04:52:00,783,"Might not help if you're in the bush or whatever, but I clean my fish at home and I take the guts and skin and put it in a couple plastic bags and then freeze it until garbage day. I'm pretty sure that's legal, and if it's not, I don't have a clue how you're supposed to dispose of the inedible portions of a fish!"
616643,Twocoda,2011-08-29 04:59:00,4130,there is only one way to properly dispose of the remnants...but it requires a second trip to your buddies vehicle to pop the nicely tied up package after a few days in the sun
616662,Fish4Eyes,2011-08-29 12:02:00,1022, I put them in the compost bin. I don't even want to see the look on the guys face when he opens up the lid and gets a wiff
616672,danbouck,2011-08-29 12:43:00,4380,"I was under the impression that it is legal if you are more than 100m from shore, but I may be wrong"
616703,FrankTheRabbit,2011-08-29 14:57:00,479,"Slightly along the lines of fish remains, what are your thoughts with filleting fish on rivers and what to do with the head and bones? I know that it is illegal to waste an entire fish on the stream (and I am against this), but taking the fillets and leaving the head/bones/tail can be beneficial to the surround environment. The nutrients can be absorbed by the local wildlife and I'm sure other little critters will take advantage of it as well."
616799,greenfin,2011-08-29 20:19:00,7," Unfortunately, you will have racoons and skunks digging up your garden looking for scraps.  Been there, done that - with disastrous results."
616800,mercman,2011-08-29 20:28:00,7054,"I put my fish on ice, take them home, wrap in newspaper and fillet them the next day.The skin seperates easier. Then i freeze the balance and throw in the trash on garbage day.Personally, i dont like finding stinking remains on the shore when i launch.  "
616809,Bernie,2011-08-29 20:56:00,3190,"I dispose of mine on the rocks beside the cottage. The gulls, herons, crows and osprey have it gone in 15 minutes."
616811,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2011-08-29 21:06:00,0,if i'm not on a lake with camps everywhere i put them on a rock on shore and they don't last.  i was told by a CO not to put them in the lake.
