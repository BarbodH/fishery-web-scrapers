618318,Twocoda,2011-09-04 07:43:00,4130,Nice Shots !!! who would have thought a lawnmower could be part of a fishermans arsenal
618332,Bulletmike,2011-09-04 11:20:00,4,     Hehehe! This stuff was so thick I think a chainsaw was in order! But it held some good fish oddly enough.

618355,lew,2011-09-04 12:52:00,12766," I knew that, still struck me as funny though"

618394,adolson,2011-09-04 16:26:00,783,"wow, you got those in that?!  I should cast my line in my back yard. I haven't cut the grass in weeks, so there should be fish?"
618986,johnnyb,2011-09-06 19:12:00,3413,Crazy pics....insane weed cover....nice fish!  Your trolling motor actually pulled you through that stuff?  I'd love to hear a bit more about how you fished it....I'd assume you were just plunking jigs.
