618521,Darrel,2011-09-05 10:42:00,82,Is Binbrook a good spot for pike and largies/smallies from shore?
618522,Fish Farmer,2011-09-05 10:45:00,2234,They do catch a few.
618525,Darrel,2011-09-05 10:54:00,82, Thanks for sharing. I'm heading out right now to try my luck at Binbrook.
618529,Roy,2011-09-05 11:16:00,13728,"Didn't you just ask that same question on another thread? Either way, good luck."
618549,lunkerbasshunter,2011-09-05 13:08:00,2585,Check the regs.  I think it is catch and release only?  Cheers!
618551,Rich,2011-09-05 13:19:00,3927,lol
618584,Lokka,2011-09-05 15:21:00,32,I don't think it's C&R but with the health posting on the fish there i would treat it as C&R
618618,uglyfish,2011-09-05 18:34:00,981,"It is a strict catch and release policy for all bass, pike and walleye. U may keep crappie, perch. Bluegill catfish and carp."
618649,Darrel,2011-09-05 20:09:00,82, Catch and release is all I do!!!
618652,vinnimon,2011-09-05 20:15:00,2593,"good luck out there, the bass were big last year, no pike for myself. But had a few eyes follow as well. Good luck, want to see a report, thats all.  "
618654,Darrel,2011-09-05 20:25:00,82," A report is on its way! Not bad either, lol. Caught my 1st Pike of the season. I will post pics shortly."
618665,Darrel,2011-09-05 20:41:00,82," I did ask about the pike yes, but added an inquiry about large/small mouth, lol. I did very well there today, I must add too!"
618680,vinnimon,2011-09-05 21:16:00,2593,"Sooooo????? how did you do today, just curious cause I love fishing that pond and havent been this year. My last outing was comprised of this out there. largies, smallies and walters to say the least.  "
618681,misfish,2011-09-05 21:17:00,29133,"I,ll be back,,,,,,,,,,,,,wheres that popcorn icon that wayne had?"
618701,Rich,2011-09-05 22:18:00,3927,You have odd definitions of C&R my friend.
618794,Darrel,2011-09-06 02:27:00,82,"It was my first time at Binbrook and yes, it's C&R...plus, after seeing the milky water, I would not keep anything from there anyway!! "
