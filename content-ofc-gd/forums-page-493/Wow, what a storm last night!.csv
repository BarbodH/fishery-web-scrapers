618324,Big Cliff,2011-09-04 10:11:00,6899,"I have never seen anything like it! The lightning flashes were almost constant with multipule flashes going so often it was almost like day light out there.  It started about 11:30 pm and went on until midnight. We must have been right under the Eastern edge of it because when I looked to the West you could still see the stars shining.  It was absolutly beautiful and I stood out on the deck for most of it just enjoying the light show. It only rained here for about 5 minutes and power flickered a couple of times but that was it for here, hope no one had any damage!"
618326,lew,2011-09-04 10:16:00,12766,Still getting the odd flash over this way Cliff and light rain started a short while ago.
618327,Terry,2011-09-04 10:38:00,14456,still lightning flashes in Bradford..  if we had a bad storm last night I slept through it
618328,Roy,2011-09-04 11:06:00,13728," UMMM, that would have put you under the western edge of it, Cliff.  Was this a test? Did I win anything? A nice light show and no damage anywhere, that's perfect."
618329,Big Cliff,2011-09-04 11:11:00,6899," LOL, I didn't get a lot of sleep last night, good call Roy  You just won that OFC sticker that you promissed me last year but don't worry I'll win it back from you again at some point!"
618330,Handlebarz,2011-09-04 11:15:00,3790,it started here last night around 7 or 8pm with a great light show then the skies opened up around 10:30 and it was on and off all night great light show and very loud thunder. I was just glad it held off until after 10pm for the rain as we had a send off party for my niece she is headed to University today we are all proud of her for that.
618331,OhioFisherman,2011-09-04 11:18:00,6623,"It stormed here too, and cut the kids bonfire short. Nice to have the cooler temps though! They are calling for a high of 63 here for Monday? You guys up there might see a frost? LOL"
618333,Garry2Rs,2011-09-04 11:25:00,1425,As usual Apsley missed all the excitement! Or I slept through it... I was out with the pup at 5AM. There were still a few flashes but it must have been far off as I didn't hear any thunder.
618340,bigugli,2011-09-04 11:54:00,6138,"We got the storm in St Jakobs in the middle of the day. 100k+ winds, driving rain, thunder and lightning, etc... .  Pretty much wiped out most of the vendors at the market. Stormed here last night, but I was too tired to notice."
618378,misfish,2011-09-04 14:29:00,29133,"We had a major down pour up at pops last night.First time he said,he seen a lake in the yard.Ride home was the same this morning.Burksfalls right down to Barrie."
618555,Jer,2011-09-05 13:33:00,1426,"We had quite the storm thru Ennismore as well...lotsa lightning, wind & rain.  The only damage seems to be to my phone line. Somehow we still have intenet (Bell Sympatico), but no dial tone on any phone in the house. Doesn't make any sense to me. The Bell techy is supposed to be here anytime."
