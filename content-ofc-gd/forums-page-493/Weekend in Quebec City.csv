I heard more english while i was there than french.Tourists from all over Canada, the U.S. and basically from around the world converge on this City, to partake in the hospitality and tradition that make this country our own. We stayed at a wonderful all inclusive Auberge, 15 minutes from Downtown. http://www.chateaubo...e_p_57_4_en.php We arrived there at 11A.M, unpacked and headed to Ste Anne-de-Beaupre, to visit the Basilica,, and other religious icons in that region. Since it was a nice sunny day, we decided to do the outdoors stuff first, then,       Montmorency Falls      Ste. Annes Canyon        then on Sunday, book a Brunch Cruise on the Louis Jolliette.           The pics don't do the place justice. So many interesting people to see, and so much history involved.Local Artisans selling unique hand made arts and crafts that you may never see anywhere else. Hope you enjoyed the pics. We had a memorable stay inone of Canadas oldest cities."
618740,lhousesoccer,2011-09-06 00:42:00,442,"You're right ... pics simply can't do Quebec City justice.  I was fortunate enough to live in this city for 2 years, while doing a graduate degree at Universite Laval.  My first apartment there was over 300 years old!  I can't say I know the city inside and out, but I do know it better than the average tourist.  I have to say, I've been to cities all over Canada, the US, Britain and northern Europe, and Quebec City is by far my favourite ""urban"" area to visit in the world."

618772,mercman,2011-09-06 01:34:00,7054,"  You have the option of using the very fragile, swaying foot bridge, or if you have big ""ONES"" you can take the Zip line below the foot bridge. I do not have big ""ONES"""
618836,lew,2011-09-06 11:41:00,12766,"Back in 1965 when I was in the Navy we needed some work done to the ship and sailed from Halifax, up the St. Lawrence River, and into the Davie Shipyards in Levis for the repairs. While there  we used to take the ferry across the river to Old Quebec to do what young sailors do.  It's a gorgeous old city with alot of history and is a great place to visit.  Some really nice pictures there Paul, thanks."
