619015,misfish,2011-09-06 20:09:00,29133,"Word has it.Back when there was a abundance of them and caught,the ones that did the filleting were covered in blue die from the fish. So my thinking is,if you catch one.your hand would have some blue dye on it."
619017,Musky or Specks,2011-09-06 20:13:00,2710,This. Its just a blue slime yellow walleye. The blue is extinct.
619019,Terry,2011-09-06 20:20:00,14456,1/2 the walleye I caught on my fly-in were blue in colour  some more then others  
619030,bubbles,2011-09-06 20:49:00,591,I have also caught a few Pike that look blue as well.  Chapleau area.

619153,ehg,2011-09-07 02:30:00,2666, Was in a barber shop the other day and read this article in fishing magazine there. Seemed to be saying that the blue colouration in some walleye (and perch) is caused by something called Sandercyanin which is usually excreted through urine. With the blue tinged walleyes the Sandercyanin is released through their skin instead. Interesting article.  http://www.ontariooutofdoors.com/fishing/walleye/?ID=86&a=read
619232,mercman,2011-09-07 15:54:00,7054,"  Excellent read EHG Answers alot of questions, but creates more.I think these scientist will be studying them for quite awhile.  Paul"
619236,lew,2011-09-07 16:25:00,12766,"10 or 12 years ago we spent a week fishing in Quebec,  40 miles or so east of Temiskiming, and probably 1/2 the pickeral we caught had the blue tinge on them."
619434,beagle dad,2011-09-08 01:50:00,224,thanks for all the info these walleye have no white tips they are speckaled not same as yellow walleye i have heard there is an out stocking pond up near the pickeral river system that had these fish in an effort to restock the species possible few got loose yrs ago?
618626,beagle dad,2011-09-05 19:06:00,224,me and the anchor have benn near dunchurch all weekend just before dark yesterday while bass fishing with tiny beatlespins the bride hooked what i believe to be a blue walleye..  no white tips not a sauger and 5-6 lbs will post pics soon  is there a definate way to identify a blue walleye?
618637,John Bacon,2011-09-05 19:33:00,3277,I understand that their eyes were larger and more upward looking. They didn't have the white tips. But they were smaller than 'yellow' walleye so a 5-6 pounder may be too large to be a true blue walleye. Could it have been a saugeye?
618640,beagle dad,2011-09-05 19:39:00,224,according to mnr lake has blue/yellow walleye sm  lm bass  cisco not supposed to to be sauger or saugeye
618651,misfish,2011-09-05 20:13:00,29133,Were you at duckrock? There has been some reports from friends that fish there.

618660,beagle dad,2011-09-05 20:38:00,224,cottage on labrasche..bow hunt there lots of deer lots of walleye
618664,Roy,2011-09-05 20:40:00,13728,"For what it's worth, the MNR officially declared the blue walleye extinct in 1985, the last one having been caught on Lake Erie in 1965. But then these are the same people who declared aurora trout as being extinct. So, whose nose."
618669,beagle dad,2011-09-05 20:46:00,224,understood! i have talked to the locals who say they catch a few each yr and these fish get real big 10-12 lb .. seen pics of 4 caught on this lake in the last yr..including icefishing
618670,miller,2011-09-05 20:49:00,223,"i fish that area on the mag, my uncles place is down the end of ladds rd. i've nailed some smaller eyes that had blueish tinges to them as well but i have yet to fish labrash."

618676,beagle dad,2011-09-05 21:05:00,224,cool.. still no answer though what this truely is as it is far from typical walleye same as you have caught lots of smaller fish but have personally seen 2 of these walleye
618683,misfish,2011-09-05 21:19:00,29133," Miller I know the spot. I always said that was a good spot to fish,but we were deer hunting then."

618692,Spiel,2011-09-05 21:33:00,9065,"I've caught many ""blue coloured walleye"" from many bodies of water over the years but they are still yellow walleye."
618693,beagle dad,2011-09-05 21:35:00,224,huh!!!! me thinks there are still blues in some small lakes
618713,adolson,2011-09-05 23:09:00,783,"There's no Auroras in Liberty Lake, I can tell you that!"
618897,lplp,2011-09-06 15:02:00,83,"we caught one in quebec, rapid seven (turning right at cadillac)and definite blue tinge to all of it,we let him go ,,he was about 2 pds.. if i can find the pic ,i will post here.."
618901,bubbles,2011-09-06 15:13:00,591,"I have caught a few, definately still around."
619013,dave524,2011-09-06 20:04:00,4508,"The Blue Walleye or Blue Pike as they were called in the states were only found in Lake Erie, Lake Ontario and the Niagara River. Saw and probably even caught a few a a kid going out of Port Colborne with my dad in the late 50's. We'd still fish over deeper water for the ""Blues"" much like they perch fish today and would troll for the ""Yellows"" as dad called them. They were never in inland lakes then and were quite different than Yellows in that they were small, 3 lbs was a big one, has big eyes and a mottled appearance much like a sauger. Can't believe any reports of them being caught outside of their historical range"
