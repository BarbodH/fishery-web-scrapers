618856,mike rousseau,2011-09-06 12:58:00,4661,Hey everyone...  I'm heading up to a cottage on four mile lake in burnt river and was wondering what the fishing is like...  From what I can see the lake isn't on my navionics map... So I'm going up blind... Wich bothers me...  Also... I'd be willing to trailer to a different lake other then four mile if it meant better fishing...   I normally fish walleye and musky... But bass or lakers would be fun as well...  I'll have 2 days to fish so maybe 2 lakes...   Anyways... If anybody can help me out please post or pm me...  Thanks   Mike

Sturgeon lake is only a 15min drive with great fishing as well.  Overalll a great area to stay if your a fisherman not afraid to travel.  Good Luck
