Trying to arrange some perch fishing with a very kind member here, but in the meantime I was wondering if anyone knows of any great places to fish from land in the Barrie area.  Again, any advice would be super appreciated!"
618966,NAW,2011-09-06 18:32:00,4022,"Just look for other anglers.  Usually there's a group of people around the tiffen st boat launch.  And on the wave break around the city marina.  Just watch for the no fishing signs.  You need a real light set up, something you can cast a long way out.  Minnows, or worms, on or close to bottom."
