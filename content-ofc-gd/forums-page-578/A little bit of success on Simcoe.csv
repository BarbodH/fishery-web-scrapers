548168,BillM,2011-02-06 03:02:00,17367,"Took the sled out for it's maiden voyage and it didn't disappoint.  Made 3 moves and #3 was the ticket.  3 fish within 10 mins and then the clouds came, the fish turned off and I was on my 10mile ride back in   Fished for maybe 3hrs today..  Short and sweet.    Some fat ladies..  Caught 1 natural and it went back (they always do, I only keep the stockers for the oldman or the neighbours)    Screen was lit up fairly steady until the clouds rolled in.  "
548174,wallacio,2011-02-06 03:22:00,475,Sweet (ride and fish) bud.   I'm jealous...I started my day kneeling in front of the porcelain and not because I had too much fun last night!
548176,BillM,2011-02-06 03:29:00,17367,"Oh man Dave, that sounds rotten.  Looking forward to the first weekend in March"
548179,wallacio,2011-02-06 03:36:00,475,"At first I thought it was appendicitis...thankfully it's ""just"" a virus.  Let's get out before March dude!"
548180,BillM,2011-02-06 03:38:00,17367,"I gotta get the oldman to build a pull behind for the sled with some skis.  I lost the damn guard for the auger, lol."
548181,irishfield,2011-02-06 03:41:00,26272,Been there .. done that Bill ! You pulling that on a rope.. you're looking for a fine on Simcoe if so..  Nice day out for sure though.. a good ride on a new toy and fish to boot!!
548182,BillM,2011-02-06 03:47:00,17367,"Yeah, the rigid bar I bought at PA wasn't working, so today it was a rope tow!  lol  I'll just whip something up with some flat bar, easiest and the cheapest."
548183,DRIFTER_016,2011-02-06 03:50:00,10439,  Bill I just used elictrical conduit for mine.
548185,BillM,2011-02-06 03:55:00,17367,"Dave, where can I pick some of that up?  HD?"
548195,DRIFTER_016,2011-02-06 05:03:00,10439,"  You should be able to get it at Lowes, HD  etc. Get 3/4"". You can make it super simple by hammering the ends flat and drilling holes through to accept carabiner clips. Mount 2 eye bolts on your boggan 15 to 18 inches appart. Clip a pipe to each eye bolt with a crarbiner and then clip the free ends together with another carabiner. You can then use one more carabiner to attach to your sled. For about $20 you can be set up."
548196,BillM,2011-02-06 05:05:00,17367,"Dave, you rock bud!  Looking forward to May"
548198,DRIFTER_016,2011-02-06 05:09:00,10439, I hop on a plane in 105 days.  Then I get to see my new outboard.
548209,12footspringbok,2011-02-06 10:20:00,459,Good work Bill definatly fun riding out there yesterday.... I lost my auger along with my buddy hualing though  a little slush feild yesterday... LOL The whities were on fire too   Perch fishing today for a change.
548300,douG,2011-02-06 16:18:00,2693,"Well done, BillM.  Nice ride."
548310,solopaddler,2011-02-06 16:42:00,8605,Sweet is right. Looking forward to joining you.
548330,Joey,2011-02-06 17:25:00,9122,"Nice report, great fish and sled  I agree, once the clouds rolled in, it as fish off"
548354,alphaalpha,2011-02-06 17:56:00,475,"nice work, thanks for the report! "
548363,BillM,2011-02-06 18:13:00,17367, We gotta get your uncle out there!!!
548674,johnnyb,2011-02-07 15:23:00,3413,Nicely done -- another snowmobiler with fish....seems to be the theme for Simcoe this year.  I have an aluminum towbar and no sled....wanna trade it for a ride on the back next time you go out?  
548687,Wymen,2011-02-07 16:41:00,30,"Hey Bill,  I have almost the same finder as you less the GPS and I'm still not sure if I am reading it properly.  Is the school of fish the yellow / green band in the middle or is it the clutter on the bottom? "
548689,icefisherman,2011-02-07 16:54:00,952,"Good report Bill. Ans very nice machine you've got. Wish I have one like that  Cheers, Ice FIsherman"
548748,misfish,2011-02-07 19:52:00,29133,Nice fish Bill.  PM sent regaurding a tow bar.Hate to see a brother get dinged with a fine.
548779,BillM,2011-02-07 21:56:00,17367,"  I raised those fish up with my spoon, it's the upper line.  The dark red line is the bottom, the blue clutter on the bottom are fish as well as the lines just slightly up from bottom.  You can also barely make out my micro swivel as well"
