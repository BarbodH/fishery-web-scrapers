I was up last winter, but didnt have any luck, hoping for better results this time around.   Thanks guys!   Cheers!"

Never caught anything but a buzz.  We ended up playing poker in the hut all afternoon.  I'm sure if we had an auger and flasher we might have found some fish as there are quite a few pike in there if I remember correctly.  Good Luck!  K.S."
