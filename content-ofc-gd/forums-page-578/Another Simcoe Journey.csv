548882,ravinerat,2011-02-08 01:20:00,64,Well This is my only day off after working the weekend so I decided to hit Simcoe for a relaxing day of Whities. I left the south shore of Kemp Bay heading toward the North East end of the lake. The going was tough. The whole lakes seems to be one big slush bed instead of the smaller pools of a week a go.     Visibility was poor at best and I got turned around a few times. Why bring a GPS if your going to doubt it. I always had to double check with my compass.    My fishtrap seemed to gather up all the slush it could and added another 50 lbs to my load. I almost got stuck a few times and bogging down was a real pain.     Finally got to where I wanted to be around 1030 hr. Marked lots of fish but no takers. Just around noon the fishing picked up and was non stop till around 2 pm.           A green bad boyz seemed to do the job today. Just  bouncing it off bottom then a lift of a foot and they’d  smash it.  I decided I didn’t want to run the lake back to Barrie since I was using more gas in the slush  so I headed to the  Oro shore line. I caught the rail trail around the 12 line and ran it back. It sure was a lot easier on me and my Tundra.    Not a bad day off at all.      RR
548884,Gregoire,2011-02-08 01:23:00,1397,Nice report. Too bad about the slush.
548886,irishfield,2011-02-08 01:27:00,26272,Thanks for the report RR!! Did you make that auger mount?? looks pretty slick!
548892,ravinerat,2011-02-08 01:33:00,64,I made the auger rack after about 2 years and one dream thinking about it. I have no fabrication skills and used a dremil and a drill. It worked out pretty good but would probally change a few things. It is held on by three pins so it comes off pretty fast for storage.  RR
548897,RickOnt,2011-02-08 01:38:00,669,"Hey RR  What's  UP???   Nice ""Sress Management"" Day   Saw a guy last week same sled (Tundra) and auger mount straight out back!!!  Took a run over to say ""Hi Don"" and it was not you!!!   Someone is using your patent  LOL   We Should get together   Rick"
548904,icefisherman,2011-02-08 01:46:00,952,"waoo Don it sure looks tough going out there...for machine or for walking... Bug you seem to have found where they are hiding  Cheers, Ice FIsherman"
548925,Terry,2011-02-08 02:32:00,14456,nice going  but I really wanted to hear the slush was getting better not worst.....
548927,asdve23rveavwa,2011-02-08 02:35:00,2690,"Good day off overall, even with the slush.  Walked out at Oro yesterday, it wasn't too bad there. Unfortunately, the fish we marked just didn't want to commit. Nice going!!"
548966,ranksda58,2011-02-08 03:57:00,69,"looks like you had a great day out there, other then the slush"
548969,Joey,2011-02-08 04:06:00,9122,"Ya, that slush looks nasty, and the visability poor, but you made it and caught some fish - well done sir"
549001,misfish,2011-02-08 10:46:00,29133,Great report Don. That sure looks messy out there.
549008,ravinerat,2011-02-08 12:34:00,64,I sure was glad I had my Baffin Rubber boots on. I was in water all day. It is kind of neat not being able to see shore(s)at time. The fog liftted by the time I headed home.  I've seen a few auger racks like mine now. Guess I came up with a good desgin.   RR
549108,cityfisher,2011-02-08 19:16:00,959,"good report RR, when sleds have a hard time out there you know its Bad !! With the warm weather coming it should only get worse"
549114,NAW,2011-02-08 19:52:00,4022,"Thanks for the report RR.  Glad I'll be on Cypress this weekend, and not Simcoe.  My fishing partner (Camocruzr from the lsmb) has a similar rack he's been running for the past 5 years now.  They work like a charm eh!  Don't have to worry about driving though fence gates..  It is a little scary for the guy riding behind on a sley though, stairing at sharp augar blades."
549181,Shelley Cooper,2011-02-08 23:28:00,394,Way to Go Don.. nice to see you got into some sweet tastin fish...    That slush sure does look nasty...
549306,Moosebunk,2011-02-09 04:23:00,3970,Nice to see ya out and beating on those awesome whities.  Great sled mods too.  You're unstoppable in the slush.
