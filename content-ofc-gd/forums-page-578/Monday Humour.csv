He hired a French guy who didn't  speak much English, but was a very good worker. After the first day, they had successfully castrated 14 sheep and his French  worker was just about to throw away the ""parts"", but the sheep farmer yelled, ""No! Don't throw those away! My wife fries them up  and we eat them. They're delicious, and we call them 'sheep fries'."" Later that day, the French hired hand came in for supper and, indeed, the ""sheep fries"" were tasty. The next day, they castrated 16 sheep, and that evening they all settled down to another supper of ""sheep fries"". The third day, however, when the sheep farmer came home, he asked his wife where the French hired hand was. ""You know, it's the weirdest thing,"" she said. ""I told him since there weren't very many 'sheep fries' this evening, we were also going to have French fries, and he ran like hell!"""
