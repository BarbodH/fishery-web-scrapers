I carried this brew on my Taps for a few months with mixed reveiws, so I let it go.  I still currently serve the lemon tea beer....which is actually a bit of a mistake. Its a great beer for those who like the ""Bud Lime's"" of the world....which makes sence in the summer. Its really not popular right now in the midst of the snow season LOL!  But I'll continue it through the summer, Our American Guests LOVE it, and dare I say....the women folk  Our biggest selling Micro right now is Camerons Lager.

When he first introduced it to me,it  was a great ""new taste"" . a quick question with the bottles, were the mold IBM's?  We used to repair lots of these molds (not for bottles) but now not as much, they were containers for the airline industry."

I tried the Fyying Monkies amber ale (?) on the weekend and enjoyed it.  15+ years ago I lived in the south west end of Toronto, you could go to the Upper Canada brewery on a Sunday and have a nice fresh draft beer and buy some for home. Now its gone, owned by Sleeman who is owned by Sapporo.  upper Canada used to make a ""Winterbrew"" a bock style high alcohol beer that was very tasty. I still like Creemore, especially the Urbock, now owned by Molson Coors."
546262,Gregoire,2011-02-01 11:55:00,1397," MIll Street makes Barley wine during the winter that is rather enjoyable, sounds to be similar to the winter brew.

ChrisK now has most of my equipment and has produced some mighty fine product.  I've sampled a lot of Mirco Brewery beers over the years and one that stands out for me is/was the Niagara Brewing Company. Been a while since I had one but from what I can see from quick research it appears that they were bought out by Moosehead and relocated.  A personal comment on Steam Whistle, thought it to be one of the worst beers I've ever had."

In general though if I'm having beer with dinner like at a restaurant 9/10 I'm having a red beer, Rickards Red is much better than Keiths Red but I'll take either.  If I'm going watching the game, just having drinks, etc. I usually prefer an ice cold MGD."
546331,backbay,2011-02-01 15:56:00,773,"I Like Creemore Lager for sure, Mill Street's Tankhouse Ale, and Steam Whistle if it's super-cold as a pilsner, in the summer. Keith's like Creemore, isn't so much of a micro anymore, but I enjoy their ale on tap after I play squash, and want something not too heavy. Anytime I'm in Quebec, I love just about anything from Unibroue, but can't really imagine drinking the more Belgian-types all the time. In terms of beer can chicken, it's the only way to fly! I always put some of the rub in the beer can, along with a crushed cove of garlic. It's pretty hard to mess up, cause the beer keeps the chicken from drying out."

If you visit the brewery, call ahead.  I've found that they sometimes keep strange hours and are closed when you'd least expect it.  If visiting the area isn't an option, contact the LCBO and they might be able to tell you the nearest store that carries it (or maybe have some ordered to the store for you to pick up?)"
