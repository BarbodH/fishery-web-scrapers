We were marking fish pretty steady, but we had a hard time getting them to go.  Made a few moves and found some fish.  Didnt land a lot, I think 6 or 7 between us the whole day but I can deal with that. Could be far worse.  Took some fish on a jiggin rap, a tube and a big black mamba. Our best bite was in about 93 feet.  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mG89yi10QhQ"
