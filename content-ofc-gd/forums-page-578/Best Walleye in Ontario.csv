549102,Headhunter,2011-02-08 18:42:00,5703,"To me, the best Pickereyes come from Nip... they just taste better then most places and they are readily available along most shore lines, just look for the processing plant. Lake Erie Pickereyes taste pretty darn good as well and even the bigger ones are fine table fare. They can be found at your local Loblaws. I would not suggest eating Pickereyes out of Quinte, they usually taste like   compared to the above two locations...and no, you can't find them at your local supermarket. I hope this helps yah! HH"
549172,Mike01,2011-02-08 23:02:00,378,you can catch all kinds of things at the moe-zee!

548873,Gregoire,2011-02-08 01:07:00,1397,A lot of fish markets have fresh walleye sold by the pound.
548874,Rod Caster,2011-02-08 01:08:00,5784,Pickeral river and walleye lake are my favorite spots.

548913,toca,2011-02-08 02:03:00,274,Its Not Really A Secret. All Is Of It Is Public Unless Its On A Private Pond/Lake.  Just gotta look for these spots. How about rephrasing your question i.e any suggestions for a rookie walleye fisherman?  Did the exact same thing and thought everybody here was a bunch of jack asses  anyways i just did a bunch of google and ask a boat operator what to look for. Came Home With Three (in six hours) So It Was Well Worth It.
548914,Pikeslayer,2011-02-08 02:03:00,1443,Have you tried Lake Aquitaine?? Best kept secret in the 905!
548915,vinnimon,2011-02-08 02:05:00,2593,  Thats still there??
548918,Pikeslayer,2011-02-08 02:12:00,1443,Yep. But they filled in the boat launch. Have to portage in now
