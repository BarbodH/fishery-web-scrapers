I'm looking for something basic and i'm wondering if anyone has any opinion on this model sold at Bass Pro  http://www.basspro.com/Ascend-A10-Sit-In-Kayak/product/10213817/-1764058  thanks  Dave"
548989,crappieperchhunter,2011-02-08 05:06:00,2582,Can't help you Dave...but I am giving serious thought to getting a yak for fishing as well...so I will be keeping an eye on this thread. I have no clue what to look for...I just know I don't want to spend alot of $$$$. The price on that one looks pretty good to me.
548997,jediangler,2011-02-08 06:49:00,1923,"That's as good a starter yak as you'll find for that price range IMHO. If you are over 6'2"" or over 225lbs, it might be a little on the small size for your comfort. I paid $279 for my first yak at Crappy tire over 6 yrs ago and my daughter has inherited now.  The best advice is to test paddle as many different kinds before making a big $$ purchase but to get you started that one will do the trick. I like the sit-in cockpit combined with the sit-on style of cratewell at the back. Check out Yakfisher.net and ask any questions on that forum and you'll get answers from experienced yakkers and fishermen from Ontario & Quebec."

They also have used ones for sale from their summer instructional sessions."

549010,jediangler,2011-02-08 12:49:00,1923,There is a Hobie PA (pro angler) for sale on Yakfisher.net for $1900. It is the aircraft carrier of kayaks at 118lbs but is a deal at that price.
549028,wildeye rainbow,2011-02-08 14:14:00,123,"I bought a sit-on-top kayak last year.  An Ocean Kayak big game prowler.  I'm 6'2"" and 260#.  It is quite stable.  I've been out on Lake Erie (on a calm day) with this yak and it handles boat wakes super.  I'm going to outfit it with a fishfinder this year & will give yak fishing more effort this year."
549050,trophypikehunter,2011-02-08 15:29:00,89,I've been yak fishing for 4 years now and I love it!!  I bought a crappy tire kayak for 299.99 and added a rod holder any cheap kayak can be made into a fishing yak I would suggest something light weight..   
549111,Phranchise,2011-02-08 19:23:00,10,"Pay a little bit more and you won't be dissapointed. Watch kijiji and other classifieds for deals on 1-2 year old yaks. You can find a great deal on Wilderness Systems Kayaks all the time. You could probably pick up a 1-2 year old tarpon for 5-700 bucks with a few surface scratches. I have heard good and bad things about the Ascends. Main problems were leaky hulls and warping of the bottom of the hull. Assuming this would be due to poor quality polyethylene. HOWEVER, I have also heard it is a great starter yak and can't be beat for the price. Its the same as anything else. If you buy a shimano sahara as your first real, you will love it. However once you upgrade to a stradic/sustain etc. there is no way you are going back to the sahara. My Honest Opinion. Have been yak fishing for just over a year."
549168,jediangler,2011-02-08 22:49:00,1923,"That's the same yak I bought Tropypikehunter.  It has served me well and will continue to do so for my daughter. I did replace it with the lightest yak I could find. It weighs 30lbs, 36lbs with the seat installed. I had to drive 300km to Muskoka to get it but I don't regret it.  The most valuable thing is that we can now spend time on the water together."
