Picked up a Dewalt 18V impact driver for $99. Includes the 2 batteries and 1HR charger. Normal $ on the web site at HD and CTC is 299  I can drive a 4"" #12 wood screw right through a 4x4 with this baby!  They had 2 left at Trafalgar and QEW store and said he was pretty sure all stores had them on clearout.  Guess there only going to carry the NiCD line up going foreward"
