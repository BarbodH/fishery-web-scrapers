548551,Rattletrap2,2011-02-07 03:48:00,1652,"Sorry for the rant here, but I was curious as to how you all feel about this. I received a letter in the mail last week that told me I have a certificate worth $10.00. It goes on to say that this is based on my rewards points...and very subtly lets me know that, if I don't use them by March 26th, 2011, THEY ARE GONE!  It says ""Dollar value listed above will be DEDUCTED on above date if not used.""  I already have a sore spot for these folks because they deleted my US based points a number of years ago in a similar manner and they took over 4 years to finally come up with a rewards points system at the Canadian store!  I think this kind of sucks on their part!  I also noticed on the web site, that the store manager has changed? Dave Jessop was the original Manager, but has now been replaced by Shawn Hewitt. Anyone know what happened here? Did Dave move on, or was he let go? I'm curious because he was never seen on the floor in any of my many visits there."

548557,kickingfrog,2011-02-07 04:00:00,8333,"From a pr stand point it does seem a bit odd. We'll give you points that you can use at a later date... but we'll take them away, if you don't use them soon enough."
548570,bigmac1984,2011-02-07 04:19:00,193,"Try this,  If you call the 1-800 number on the back of your rewards card you can tell them you want your points to be valid for a year, otherwise I believe you have to use them within 6 months or they expire.  I did that and there were no questions asked, and went right to a live person."
548571,bigugli,2011-02-07 04:20:00,6138,"Put simply, the rewards program is a short term marketing ploy to get you into the store and purchase. By limiting the time you can roll over your points, they hope to get you into the store more frequently.  They really don't want to see customers roll the points over for big purchases. Something you could always do with some other programs in the past. Still remember a while back, my one friend walked into the CTC with a breifcase full of funny money to buy a canoe.  The person at the service desk almost fainted."
548583,Stern Rules,2011-02-07 07:06:00,342,I got the same letter and don't agree with the expiry date either. I agree with bigugli. They don't want you to collect alot of points at once. If they had that card when they opened I would have had a lot of points but now hardly buy much when I go there. Did you happen to get a letter for a preferred rewards member card as well?
548594,pikehunter,2011-02-07 10:53:00,1659,"When I signed up they informed that yes there was a time period for points. Forget  the time span though. Use them or loose them!  Can't blame them, casinos do the same. Read the fine print, or are you one of those that never reads the directions or rules?"
548598,Billy Bob,2011-02-07 11:33:00,5865,In the USA if you make a purchase before the expiration date it extends your points again...don't know if it's the same in Canada.  Cabela's points never expire......
548600,buckhorn250,2011-02-07 11:37:00,85,"This is a very standard process for any loyalty program, especially those that are relatively new to the mark. Liability is a huge issue that has grown out of these programs...the points need to sit on your books until they are redeemed. The issue is that many people collect, but not everyone redeems. Many programs are moving to this type of points epiry models including the coalitions. And yes the purpose of the program is to spark a transaction or visit at least every 8 months. Points should just be a bonus...a really good loyalty program provide value outside of just equity.  However the member is correct...most programs will reinstate points if you call...have not heard of one instance where they have refused."
548601,Roy,2011-02-07 11:43:00,13728,"That all sounds logical, Buckhorn. Thanks for the post."
548604,danbouck,2011-02-07 11:50:00,4380,I was told that you can get a gift card for the amount you have and then you are good for another year.
548606,buckhorn250,2011-02-07 12:04:00,85,"If you can redeem for a giftcard then that is the way to go. In ontario legislation demands that monies on giftcards cannot expire or be eroded in anyway through service fees. However this applies to giftcards that were purchased with cash, its a bit grey if you redeem points for a GC...current thought is that they could expire them. However, most retailer cannot distinguish between cards purchased with cash and those redeemed through loyalty programs...so most likely your safe."
548608,2advanced,2011-02-07 12:14:00,53,I buy gift cards with the points.  No expiry

548655,ColdH20guy,2011-02-07 14:28:00,312,"I was there yesterday and have emailed the new manager about my yet again, negative experience with the fishing department sales people..I love BPS but what happened to customer service..? Its terrible in the store.. We'll see if he gets back to me..."
548737,LeXXington,2011-02-07 19:31:00,1928,"Got the same letter. I don't know if you can buy a gift card with points? normaly the don't like that because again a gift card can't expire so they have to hold the value on the books.   Think BPS is bad, try Aeroplan they will only send you an e-mail letting you know your points are about to expire."
548763,raysfish2005,2011-02-07 21:08:00,163,HAHHAHAHAaaa...i just called to see how may points i have...lol....715 points eqauls $15.00  looks like i will have to stop into the store tonight to get my 4 free lures...lol
