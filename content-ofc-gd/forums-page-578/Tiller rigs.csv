276389,trapshooter,2008-12-06 20:01:00,1234," Definitely not.  We had a 115 tiller on an 18' ProV CE (no carpet, no rod locker, no livewell etc.) and it would top out at 43."
276438,Mike the Pike,2008-12-06 21:55:00,3421, My cousin has a Lund Prosport 115 optimax I have been 46mph with him in that boat.   I can't believe it not one comment from our resident Red Neck   about tillers and his love for the side console.
276459,modny,2008-12-06 22:35:00,502, would u consider the pro sport a heavy boat compared to a 20 foot alaskan?
276544,Mike the Pike,2008-12-07 01:42:00,3421,"  Not much of a weight difference the Prosport weighs 1200lbs and the Alaskan tiller weighs 1105lbs.  I guess 25hp does allow for 5mph more top speed than the Alaskan ,I wonder if having the full wrap windshield makes the boat cut through the wind better.So when you buying a Lund Holy Dude???  Your going to need 150hp or more to get over 50MPH if its a fully loaded fishin machine.  "
548276,stratosdude,2011-02-06 15:37:00,2, Hi  My name is Mike. I owned a 2008 Lund 1725 Proguide. A very nice boat. Lots of room and pretty dry.  Plenty of storage. a great handling boat. I set mine up with a 75 Yamaha 4 stroke. I put on hydraulic steering which made it a dream to handle. Before that I had a lot of steering torque from the prop. I got 39 MPH (GPS) two guys with gear. A couple of things I didn't like was the console for electronics. The one on the 1825 is much nicer and larger. The one on the 1725 is small and pretty cheesy. They just screwed the fuse panel to the inside of it where it really has no protection from the elements. I also didn't like the fact that there was not much control on the rear and front live wells. Other then turning the fill knob to control fill and aeration. The front huge rod locker was sweet. A big plus for me. Your rods are protected and that is important. Just remember to leave the door open after the boat gets wet. In order to dry out to avoid mold in the compartment and on your rods.  A good boat all in all though. I am presently looking at a G3 162T. I think their fit and finish is a bit better then Lunds.

548304,Lungelarry,2011-02-06 16:26:00,294,Try and find an older Ranger fisherman model...its what the pros use where you fish....
548324,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2011-02-06 17:11:00,0, I will be purchasing a tiller because in my eyes all a console does is take up valuable floor space.  If I ran a 200 hp 22 foot bassboat i'd get a console... but in a 17 footer with a small hp motor I'd go with a tiller any day of the week.
548325,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2011-02-06 17:13:00,0,whoops.  i didn't notice how old this was until it was too late! lol!
548332,Drew_10,2011-02-06 17:30:00,111,Check out the classified section on   www.walleyecentral.com  Theres some awesome tillers available if you're willing to to buy in the US.
548347,trapshooter,2011-02-06 17:49:00,1234,I'm a tiller guy through and through.  Backtrolling is the most efficient way to structure fish for walleye and throw a bow mount on it and you're casting shorelines all day with nothing but open space from the motor to the bow.  Look at this 175 Alumacraft Navigator Tiller  http://www.alumacraft.com/2011-models/navigator-series/175-tiller/#info  Rated for a 75 but they make a 185 that is rated for a 90.  They hold up much better then a similar lund after the same amount of use and abuse.

276039,Bernie,2008-12-06 01:14:00,3190, Hey wow Forrest. I gotta get you to prop my boat for me.
276041,Mike the Pike,2008-12-06 01:15:00,3421, Be careful Forrest I asked my dealer about a prop that would give me more top end .It can be done but with risk it can over rev the motor easily and poof no more motor.My dealer told me that is the risk and he has seen it happen. 50mph from a 16 ft tinny with a 40 .I don't think thats possible unless Roy is driving
276080,cellwood,2008-12-06 02:29:00,11,Alum. Nav. 165. 75 E-tec. Best boat i've ever owned.
276149,forrest,2008-12-06 04:35:00,1032," The mercury service manual has several pages of specs that relate boat weight, prop size/pitch and motor size (worth the $90):  With over revving Its the other way around.  An increased pitch puts a load on the engine, Too low a pitch (slower top end) and your enginre revs out:  Bicycle Analogy on flat land: Put your bike in the hardest gear, you will get top speed and not rev out. Put your bike in the easiest gear, you will top early and be reving your poor legs to an accident.   right now my boat is under propped.  It will max out at ~34mph without being at full revs or throttle,  I need more weight in the boat or a higher pitch prop for the ideal setup. For that and other reasons I always take it easy at a reasonable 24mph.  BTW....its bad to over prop it too. Its all about the proper weight/prop match.  forrest"
276157,forrest,2008-12-06 04:52:00,1032,"Dug the merc manual out of the garage.  From the Merc manual:  Prop: 10"", 19 pitch, 3 blades Boat: Gross weight up to 800lbs  Resulting speed range: 45-53mph.  My total boat weight bare bones: 810lbs 350lbs (hull) 220lbs (engine) 165lbs (me) 50lbs (battery) 25lbs (fuel)  Bare bones ssv-18 add 110lbs  + 30lbs for 60HP = 950lbs  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  The 30HP merc gives the same top speed at 600lbs so a total guess would be SSV-18 up to 1200lbs with 60HP motor on it would do 53mph  that is until it flips over backwards  I think I may like hte 40hp in the future but this year 30 would have easily been enough. I probably could have gotten away with a 30HP and been just as happy or happier for ever....I would have been 45lbs lighter on the transom and not have to be moving my batteries and add weight to the front.  forrest"
276158,Bernie,2008-12-06 04:55:00,3190,"Sorry Forrest it isn't ""all about proper weight/Prop match"". It is part of it. The faster you go the more friction is added multiplying the amount of torque/HP required. You cant put a 19"" prop on a 5hp and get 50 MPH out of it. There is hull design, horse power, friction and torque in the equation. If you put too large of a prop on a boat it may or will take the RPM's down below its powerband. It will or can make your boat slower. It can also be hard on your internal engine parts by creating more strain on bearing surfaces. Most manufacturers will give you an RPM range to work with a particular engine. Usually it will be within a 500 rpm range. This is where you want your engine to run when it is wide open with a normal load. A top quality stainless prop is the way to gain performance. Aluminum blades will flex a little at high rpm and you lose a little bit."
276160,forrest,2008-12-06 05:04:00,1032, Who really wants to do 50mph in a tiller?  Of course the hull has something to do with it but hydrodynamics and aero dynamics is a bit much for the conversation.  Throw a top on the boat look out! Higher weight....drop the pitch. The lighter the boat the higher the pitch required to result in the same forces on the motor parts.  I am not a mechanic but I did good in physics and read the mercury documentation. .....being more correct by saying it is all about force/pitch/revs just sounds silly.   And an aluminum prop.....thats a choice but it puts extra force on the prop shaft if you hit something doesn't it?  And they cost a fortune!  forrest  Where are the mechanics?
276161,Bernie,2008-12-06 05:09:00,3190,  I am Family has been in boating since the 1920's. Rigged many a boat myself.
276165,forrest,2008-12-06 05:17:00,1032, OK...so what is up with the merc manual giving an estimate of top speed of their engine on a 800lb boat being 45-53mph? Are they completely fabricating the numbers?  forrest
276168,Bernie,2008-12-06 05:24:00,3190,To be honest Forrest I don't know. What manual are you looking at? The owners manual? Perhaps it may be a little performance optimism from Mercury. I always have gone with experience of looking at the boat and motor taking a selection of props and putting on the correct one. Always seems to work out fine.
276169,rickster,2008-12-06 05:25:00,495,  yup
276173,forrest,2008-12-06 05:38:00,1032,"OK....so from my experience with the ssv-16, 40HP merc 4strk on GPS, with 1100lbs gross weight, 2 guys in the boat, I did 34mph and there was still room on the throttle for more (if I had a higher pitched prop.....hey I had to go fast at least once  So add 150lbs for the SSV-18 setup (with 4 stroke)....consider the HP on the motor is 150% of mine and guess what the speed with be.   50MPH stats: From the SERVICE MANUAL, the ones a mechanic would use to tear the engine down, that mercury puts the specs in for my 40.....maybe they were testing on aluminum race boats, so see above for my real world no crap experience.  forrest PS....I gotta ask again...who wants to do 50 in a tiller? PS....and my bad for not emphatically stating that I have not done 50."
276176,Bernie,2008-12-06 05:42:00,3190,I have to ask. How did you clock the speed? And yes I have done more than 50 in a tiller but sooner have a wheel at that speed.

276190,Mike the Pike,2008-12-06 07:06:00,3421," MY SSV did not have the IPS hull and was 10hp from the maximum.All I know is for the amount of money this guy spent to trick out his SSV 18 I came out way ahead by purchasing a Lund 1660 Classic .More storage wider boat more floor space,platform for my bow mount electric motor,sport track system for rod holders and accessories much deeper hull,sheesh the guy still is without a livewell.  BTW Forrest you bought a good boat the SSV is built like a tank.Mine was in Mint condition when I traded it in.  Percher clocked me on the GPS from his boat with 2 people in my boat(SSV 18) plus fishing gear at 31mph thats it thats all."
276234,Guest lundboy,2008-12-06 13:34:00,0," I don't know how one would ""re-badge"" a Lund into a G3 and remove the rivets and replace them all with welded joints.  Next time at the boat show take a closer look at the fit and finish of the welds on a G3 and the odd bends and seams of the sheet metal.  Besides Lund is owned by Brunswick Corporation,  G3 is owned by Yamaha Motor Company... A competitor to Brunswick."
276261,forrest,2008-12-06 15:46:00,1032, I completely agree and like your setup better than that one the guy converted.  He did it for hobby purposes too and previously his webpage said he might not go through the same labour of love again.  Often I look at your posts and know I will eventually follow the same path that you did SSV first then a Classic type boat.  I looked at the classic and thought it was the greatest thing.  My choice for a bare bones hull boiled down to money.  The price of a roomier feature full boat is one thing but adding the tow vehicle I would have to buy ended up being too much.  It is all about the fun though.  forrest
276313,modny,2008-12-06 17:47:00,502,  i would no problem
276320,Walshskie,2008-12-06 18:06:00,58,"To pick between a tiller and a counsel it all depends what kind of fishing you like to do I fish musky allot and in nasty weather so a full windshield and a rain top works great for me, but if you are into smaller lakes and trolling for walleyes then a tiller is the way to go.  One thing with a tiller it tow like a rocket I wish some one would make a full windshield that could fold down when towing it like dragging a pareshoot"
276360,modny,2008-12-06 19:31:00,502,"dont they also offer the lund 20 foot alaskan with a 115 tiller?  if so, it would break 50mph wouldn't it"

275683,johndox,2008-12-05 03:47:00,54,Buddy of mine has a G3 with a 50hp tiller on it and just loves it. He is always fishing 3-4 people in and seems to have tons of room. He is a tall guy and can almost lay down across the back
275685,Mike the Pike,2008-12-05 03:56:00,3421,Tiller there are no other kinds.  My first boat was a fiberglass boat with open deck full wrap windshield and steering wheel had it 2 yrs but it just didn't feel right so I sold it.  I went one summer with just a my 12 foot tinny and it was tiller.  A year later I bought a Lund SSV 18 footer Tiller of course had that for 4 yrs.  I just changed this year to a Lund 1660 Classic 7ft wide deep hull finally got the boat I always wanted.  I most troll for Walleye and prefer only needing one hand to operate the boat.  Have a look at the sportrak mounting system Fil I can position my rod holders anywhere along the gunwhales along with other accessories Not one hole drilled in the boat.I took this motor off my SSV barebones aluminium it is now more fuel effeichent than the previous boat. IPS provides a smooth ride very little resistance.           Thanks for the pic Wayne
275688,Mike the Pike,2008-12-05 03:58:00,3421, Fil I have taken care of the cold in November. Darthvader keeps me comfortable at 30mph. 
275691,Mike the Pike,2008-12-05 04:07:00,3421, I have never seen a tiller guy hang his rod outside the boat on that side .He may as well use a side console he would be sittin in the same position. must be a model not a fisherman  Good Luck with your purchase
275694,trapshooter,2008-12-05 04:16:00,1234,For me it's simple... I backtroll A LOT and you can't beat the precise boat control that comes with backtrolling a tiller.  I can move fast along a break line or hold steady in a small area if I find a good school of fish. I like to stand when I fish and the one handed operation gives me a big advantage for multi-tasking in the boat and the livewell/graph are right there with me.  The rest of the boat is wide open.  Front trolling a tiller is easy too.  Biggest downside for me is getting splashed at the back of the boat when driving through bigger waves.
275696,Sinker,2008-12-05 04:18:00,8692,  Hahahaha......thats the first thing I noticed too!!!  Model for sure!!

275848,Roy,2008-12-05 18:15:00,13728,"Ben, I'm not sure but I think they need the extra distance away from the motor so that those hydraulic tillers can clear the seat on the larger motors....good point though."
275856,trapshooter,2008-12-05 18:39:00,1234,"Hey Roy, I guess I should have said the seat needs to be moved 8"" to the starboard side of the boat.  It is too close to the centre.  They are definitely far enough forward.   Tillers Unite!"
275873,fishingisliving,2008-12-05 19:33:00,170,The only Aluma dealer in my area (well.. with a 2 hours drive) is switching to G3boats.  That solves that issue for now.

276003,modny,2008-12-06 00:25:00,502,if i decided on a lund ssv-18 and a 60 horse tiller how fast do u think that bad boy would travel at WOT ?
276008,trapshooter,2008-12-06 00:34:00,1234,depends how many guys and how much gear/gas you have in the boat but I'd guess 35mph.
276014,mbac31,2008-12-06 00:44:00,904,Tillers have their place. I grew up using them. Trouting and fishing in the ocean. Most guys back home still mostly use  tillers. My grandfather still uses a 16 footer with a 45 evinrude tiller.  You get great instant response time on turning or trolling. Sometimes a little harder to see whats up front when loaded though.
276018,modny,2008-12-06 00:47:00,502,"  thats it eh? that sucks   i love those big tillers, like 150-300hp with the hydraulic steering...  so cool,and such a tecnhological advancement in tiller performance"
276021,trapshooter,2008-12-06 00:53:00,1234, It was just a guess.  Depends how heavy the boat is maybe it'd be 40+mph with little gear/gas/guys.  35mph gets the job done though.
276024,Mike the Pike,2008-12-06 00:56:00,3421,     When I had my SSV 18 footer with a 50hp Honda I could go 33mph alone with 2 and fishing gear 31mph.  It may sound slow to you but its all I need and my Honda four stroke is really cheap on gas.  The same motor pushes my new Lund a 1660 classic.  In the new boat I can go 31mph alone add some gear and another fisherman and it goes 29mph.  All these speeds were from a GPS
276026,Bernie,2008-12-06 00:58:00,3190,I would say your first estimate was pretty good Ben. An 18 ft boat with a 60 unloaded like what you fellows are looking at would be about 30 to 35. Takes a lot of HP to push a boat 40 to 50 mph. And more fuel.
276031,Spiel,2008-12-06 01:03:00,9065, Indeed. My 17' Lund with a 75 tiller will do between 35 and 40 depending on the load.
276032,forrest,2008-12-06 01:05:00,1032,"  An SSV-16 with a 40HP motor and one driver will do 50MPH+.  Its all in the prop.....certain pitches will top you out at xMPH, doesn't matter what boat it is on. An SSV-18 with 60 will do?  forrest"
276034,Mike the Pike,2008-12-06 01:07:00,3421, Fil when you purchase the boat the dealer will position the seat in the exact place you want it.  That is what I did when I picked up the boat found the comfortable seating position then they proceeded to screw down the seat.
275397,fishingisliving,2008-12-04 14:05:00,170,"Looking in ordering a new boat this winter, i am very interested in a tiller.

I guess they are not making any changes this year.. . ?  what is your cruising and top speed with a 60?"
275417,The Urban Fisherman,2008-12-04 15:04:00,2050,"I don't know much about the tiller models, but I've used the 17 foot side console G3  with a 115 4stroke on the back and it's an AWESOME BOAT...I know you don't want a side console, but I imagine the tiller version is essentially the same boat....Very wide boat for it's length, and roomy - we shot a walleye show on quinte comfortably with 2 to 3 foot rollers, 2 camera guys, video gear, fishing gear, and two fisherman! Also fished smallies on the middle of Erie in december with that boat.  Either way, I'm sure they're both great boats but I've only been in the G3.  Good luck with your purchase.  Very exciting getting a new boat"
275419,fishingisliving,2008-12-04 15:12:00,170,Yeah the width on that boat is quite impressive for its length.  for me its all about the beam width.   Having run it with a 115 do you think a 75 will do the job with 4 anglers in the boat and some gear? ( I dont plan on being so crowded in the boat but I also want the boat to perform and have power to spare incase I need it)
275421,The Urban Fisherman,2008-12-04 15:18:00,2050,"If I'm not mistaken I believe the boat does about 45MPH with 3 guys and a full load.  There'd be a little less weight with the tiller model so you'd assume a smaller motor would be fine, but I'm no expert so it probably wouldn't hurt to contact the manufacturer.  I might be able to get some info for you if you'd like.  Shoot me a PM with your e-mail and I'll see what I can do.  My buddy who owned this boat (bought it from Dave Mercer) recently got rear ended and the boat had to be written off...   The only thing that somehow didn't sustain any damage was the motor so he's trying to sell it."
275422,Roy,2008-12-04 15:21:00,13728,2009 models will be available for viewing on the net this month. That's the way I think it should be. I don't know about my top speed cause I've never clocked it on the GPS. I imagine it's close to 40 mph. Plenty fast for me.
275466,Spiel,2008-12-04 17:32:00,9065,....I have the second one pictured (Lund) and love it.
275485,trapshooter,2008-12-04 18:23:00,1234,for a pure fishing boat I wouldn't have anything but a tiller.  Backtrolling is a deadly technique for targeing a lot of different species with different presentations and you can't beat a tiller for backtrolling.  I've run lund ProV tournament series tillers and alumacraft tournament series tillers both w/ 90 HP 4 stroke and the alumacraft wins hands down.  They've got some awesome layouts in their tillers too.  Happy shopping
275497,Zib,2008-12-04 18:44:00,369,"My buddy had a Lund Pro guide 17' then after his little accident he decided to go with an Alumacraft. The Alumacraft has a much smoother & drier ride than the Lund that he had.    BTW, I was told by a sales guy that the G3 & Lunds are one in the same. He said the G3 was just a rebadge Lund that only comes with a Yamaha motor. Don't know if it's true or not but they looked to be the same when I looked at them at the fishing show. With the Alumacraft you can get it with any brand motor that you want."
275524,anders,2008-12-04 19:56:00,1168,I would check out the 17ft Mirrocraft tillers as well.  They make a great tiller.
275529,fishingisliving,2008-12-04 20:18:00,170, never heard that one before.  Anything is possible. this new model this year is also very apealing but the price difference to get the 172T makes it hard to consider the 162T  
275532,fishingisliving,2008-12-04 20:29:00,170,"indeed they do.. 92inch beam, nice. thanks, never looked at these before. "
275537,anders,2008-12-04 20:44:00,1168,"I know two guys in town here that run that tiller and both have nothing but great things to say about them.  Funny enough, they both have e-tecs on the back too.  Watched them in very very rough water in August on Superior for salmon, looked like a very smooth and dry ride."

275641,fishdawg,2008-12-05 01:43:00,912,ive been running the 16' Crestliner Canadian tiller for 5 seasons now... (they make the same model in other lengths too)       I am very happy with it I use it for trolling Lake Ont & Erie and am very comfortable in it. I also use it on smaller lakes & have no problem launching it off a beach The hull has a lifetime warranty & the 30hp 4stroke Johnson (tho its rated for 50hp max) pushes it at 30mph WOT.
275650,Radnine,2008-12-05 02:17:00,1538,"I know that I am going to catch five kinds of hell for this, but I don't see the allure of the tiller. The guys in the photo (leaning to reach, straining to see over the bow, and Roy doing the ""look ma, I can drive a boat with one hand behind my back"") don't even make it look appealing. Why not a console? Jim"
275651,Sinker,2008-12-05 02:19:00,8692,"Im not sure about all those boats above, they're all nice, and I'd take any one of them in a heartbeat. What I do know is my 16' starcraft tiller takes a BEATING all year round. I've had it for 10 years nowd, I""m the second owner, and not a hitch with the hull. I fish as soon as I can get it in the water, and I was just out in it yesterday duck hunting. It won't get put away until there is absolutley no more open launches, and even then, I can launch it off a beach if I have to. I'll be keeping this boat when I upgrade, that's how much I like it!! I fish/hunt all over from lake O, to small back lakes in it!  Sinker"
275652,BillM,2008-12-05 02:22:00,17367,"My oldman loves fishing out the back of our tiller....  Quick access to the graphs, the bait bucket, the sump, battery, fuel tank etc etc...  Console are also more money"
275663,fishdawg,2008-12-05 03:02:00,912,for now I prefer the openess of a tiller - big open dance floor im a multi species guy who fishes different ways on different waters - the tiller allows me to be versatile
275678,Sinker,2008-12-05 03:26:00,8692," You got it exactly. I hunt a lot out of mine, and I do everything from downrigging, to back water bassin in mine. There aren't too many places I can't get into with a tiller. Lots of room for decoys, and lots of room for gear when fishing. If I had a console boat, it would be wrecked by now for sure, and I would have taken the lower end off my engine loooong ago. Reverse on a tiller gives you the most control there is on a boat, from weaving thru stumps in the duck marsh, to getting up rapids in rocky shallow rivers.....a tiller will do it all, and you can see exactly where that prop is at all times!!  Sinker"
275682,fishingisliving,2008-12-05 03:42:00,170,"The alumacraft is becoming very interesting. The size, weight and beam combination on the Navigator 175 is very tempting.  There are some dream tillers out there, but if I could afford these I would be having a different discussion... imagine 60mph in minus 5 degree november evenings and no windshield... there goes your tan.   Ranger has a killer setup this year as well.  20 footer."
