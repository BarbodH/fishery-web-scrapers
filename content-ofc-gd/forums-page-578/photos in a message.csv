548993,toca,2011-02-08 05:27:00,274,i usually use my facebook account. im too lazy to put them up on flicker and those other sites
549004,danbouck,2011-02-08 11:54:00,4380, I believe Facebook has changed and you can't do that anymore
549013,smally21,2011-02-08 13:03:00,993,create an account and upload photos to photobucket.  you can manage albums and photos there. then you can copy the IMG version of the image (you'll see it at the bottom of the four file options) and paste it into your post.
549075,misfish,2011-02-08 16:46:00,29133, Yep by far the easiest site to use IMO.The only one I have ever used.You can put photos and vids.
549088,smally21,2011-02-08 18:00:00,993,i think misfish was the guy that told me how to post pics....
