548965,BFSC Kevin,2011-02-08 03:45:00,1351,"After seeing young_one's successful mod to his rod to add the st croix spring bobber, I decided to do it to a few of my rods too.  Original thread- http://www.ofncommunity.com/forums/index.php?showtopic=50635  Items used for surgery Rod repair kit from BPS @ $7.99 (contains three rod tips) St croix spring bobbers from JB @ $9.99 each or Radio world @ $7.00 but radio world only has one MH and one H left for this season Plastic things from home depot @ 0.24 each because the home depot I went to didn't have the wire grommets that young_one used   Fits right into the rod tips     My old spring bobber from BPS   Home made on bottom, legend on bottom   Home made on bottom, legend on bottom   Legend rod in the middle with two of my home made ones "
548971,toca,2011-02-08 04:32:00,274,Interesting. Just One Question: Why Not Put The Rubber Gromet On The First Eye And Insert The Spring Bobber Directly?  Just A Suggestion Thats All But Either Way I Like The Idea.
548975,BFSC Kevin,2011-02-08 04:45:00,1351,Hmm... I guess you could but I think it is best to have the spring parallel with the rod so it has that angle to it    its the best spring bobber on the market!
548976,BFSC Kevin,2011-02-08 04:47:00,1351,I used the Frabil panfish popper ones before where you need to thread the line through the spring and I found it to always freeze up. Verrrry annoying.
548977,Victor,2011-02-08 04:47:00,1609,great work man.  is that really alot better than the BPS ones you had on b4? ... now... can i have your BPS ones LOL!
548979,BFSC Kevin,2011-02-08 04:50:00,1351,Yes they are that good. Ask Anthony. lol Yes I have some that I don't need anymore that I can give you
548982,toca,2011-02-08 04:50:00,274,You Just Gave Me An Awesome Idea  Heat Shrink Tubes And The Removal Of The First Eye And Re Insertion(After Inserting The Tube Shrink + Glue).  Hmm now i need a ride to jb depot
