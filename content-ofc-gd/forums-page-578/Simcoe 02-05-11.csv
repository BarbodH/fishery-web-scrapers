548273,Joey,2011-02-06 15:35:00,9122,"Ya, we did not envy the ATV's yesterday, looked like they were struggling, and really making a mess of the ice to tell you the truth.  Putting big, huge ruts in that will definately freeze up.  But as Terry said, out from IBP you should be good to go out to 80 FOW.  It kind of has an ice road there from so much traffic.  Joey"
548289,BillM,2011-02-06 15:50:00,17367," I noticed the same yesterday as well, when those 2ft deep tracks freeze up, it's going to get nasty out there.  Although right now there's a bit of a melt going on!  I don't think many people will be driving out this year (Although I did see some cars drive out off of 9th yesterday)"
548387,EC1,2011-02-06 20:30:00,930,"NICE! I had my shot my only keeper fish yesterday, but lost it just before the hole."
548602,misfish,2011-02-07 11:48:00,29133,"Great pics J. Nice fish by all aswell,,,,,,,,,,,Paul whats up me bro"
548605,Roy,2011-02-07 11:54:00,13728,"What a great day out for you guys! Thanks for sharing, Hon."
548700,highdrifter,2011-02-07 17:27:00,2534,"Nice fish Joey!!  Good to see Simcoe giving up the goods.  I was in Keswick on Sunday..  it was pretty bunk.  One fine day, it'll be Paul's turn..  And mine too!"
548106,Joey,2011-02-06 00:48:00,9122,"Met up with the usual suspects again today on Simcoe.  What a beautiful sunrise just before we arrived.      I finally got my laker       Lloyd put on quite a show today               I Love this photo     Terry did well for himself too today, I lost count, but didn't take too many pictures as the fish kept showing on the finder whenever I'd leave my seat        Poor Paul got skunked      Then the wonderful drive home     Canal Road sign!!!        Only saw one car in the ditch with an ambulance (picture turned out too fuzzy)  Took us twice as long to get home  Oh well, it was worth it.  Great times with friends and lots of fish today.  Couldn't have asked for anything better  Thanks guys, see you next weekend  Joey"
548109,spincast,2011-02-06 00:51:00,3279,Looks like a great day - some nice fish there
548113,alphaalpha,2011-02-06 00:54:00,475,Nice work!  I was out there today as well with a buddy but we couldn't get them to commit.  quite a few follows and two legitimate bites but couldn't get the hook in em.  Tried everything i could think of to entice them.  They seemed to follow the williams the most but would sniff it and leave
548115,Cudz,2011-02-06 00:56:00,2652,wow your day looks way better than my day.  Small perch and herring for me.
548119,beginner,2011-02-06 01:01:00,542,wow.. well done.. I myself got skunked too..  all herring.. MNR has to do something with the fish lol im tired of those fish..  love the exhibition loyd..

548138,solopaddler,2011-02-06 01:48:00,8605,"Fantastic day, and no mishaps this time either!"
548139,irishfield,2011-02-06 01:48:00,26272,"Man that's some tough salt to handle!! lol  Glad it was a great day... at least I got to make sure all my stuff was in order.. the new truck wiring harness had issues with the dash telling me ""wiring fault in trailer"" (when it was the truck). Was ready to go until Leah took Jen to the hospital at 2am.  Glad you gals had a great day on the ice and caught lotsa fish. Looks like Lloyd was struggling with a double header there.. or the same fish on two lines?"
548141,Joey,2011-02-06 01:52:00,9122, You got that right Terry    We were thinking of you and Jen all day Wayne.  Real sorry you missed out today.  Hope Jen is okay.  Joey
548142,irishfield,2011-02-06 01:55:00,26272,"Slight fever hanging in at 37.9/37.7.. she was 38.9 when Leah ran her in last night and of course on arrival, after getting into Emerg, she was only 37.5. But good thing she's still there with temp still yo yoing.. IV.. antibotic drip etc to give her some white blood cells."
548144,asdve23rveavwa,2011-02-06 01:59:00,2690,Nicely done by all.  Hoping for a little of that success in the AM myself.  Hopefully the drive up there is better than the one you all had coming home!!!  Stop hogging all the fish Lloyd
548149,ravinerat,2011-02-06 02:11:00,64,Sure looks like a great day on Simcoe. Some great smiles in the pics.   RR
548153,icefisherman,2011-02-06 02:21:00,952,"Nice show again guys and girl  What a difference having a snow machine makes... Nice pictures as always Joey  Cheers, Ice Fisherman"
548158,Terry,2011-02-06 02:30:00,14456,"You ever notice if you want to catch a fish start cooking your soup  a fish will bite ever time  <a href=""http://s25.photobucket.com/albums/c52/Mrbeee1954/?action=view&current=soup.jpg"" target=""_blank""><img src=""http://i25.photobucket.com/albums/c52/Mrbeee1954/soup.jpg"" border=""0"" alt=""Photobucket""></a>"
548159,irishfield,2011-02-06 02:35:00,26272,Always Terry.. only time I see them.. is when I'm trying to stir my chef boy r d or my Mr Noodles !! lol  I think we should leave a can on the burner all day long.. maybe they know something we don't!
548169,BillM,2011-02-06 03:04:00,17367,"Good job Joey!  I was thinking of hitting BBP today for some lakers, but I needed to get the whitie skunk off my back, lol.  Glad there were no bumps and bruises this trip out!!!"
548184,trapshooter,2011-02-06 03:53:00,1234,"Way to go Joey!!  Great lake trout, congrats!"

548217,Big Cliff,2011-02-06 12:41:00,6899,"Beautiful pictures, sounds like a fantastic day. Glad to hear that you made it home safe and sound.  I noticed an ATV in one of the photos, are they having much trouble getting around on the lake? I am thinking that I might bring mine up to the Fishing for Tylre thing this year."
548229,fishhunter,2011-02-06 13:39:00,604,Was good to get out again with friends.Only drag was Wayne and Dano could not make it  . The fishing was great. Every move we made put us on fish all day. That drive was nuts!!! Took me 2 hours to get home. Normal drive is an hour. Same place same time next Sat.
548236,MCTFisher9120,2011-02-06 13:57:00,3761,Great Report Joey! Hopefully we can get into some trout next weekend out there...well see!
548252,Terry,2011-02-06 15:16:00,14456, where the slush fields are they are having a heck of a time getting around but if you just want to run strait out to 80 ft of water for whitefish you should be fine if it doesn't get any warmer
548268,splashhopper,2011-02-06 15:31:00,2931,wtg on the laker
