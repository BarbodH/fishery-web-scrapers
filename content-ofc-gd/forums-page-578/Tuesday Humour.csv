Not only did it look good, the aroma was wonderful. He asked the waiter, ""Wha is that you just served?"" ""A, senor,"" the waiter replied, ""you have excellent taste! Those are called 'Cojones de Toro', the testicles from a bull fight this morning. A delicacy!"" It smelled so good, the tourist said, ""What the heck, bring me an order."" ""I am so sorry, senor,"" said the waiter. ""There is only one serving per day because there is only one bull fight each morning. If you come early tomorrow and place your order, we will be sure to save you this delicacy."" The next morning, the tourist returned, and placed his order. That evening he was served the one and special delicacy of the day. After a few bites and inspecting his platter, he called the waiter and said, ""These are delicious, but they are much, much smaller than the one I saw you serve yesterday."" The waiter shrugged his shoulders and replied, ""Si, Senor. Sometimes the bull wins."""
