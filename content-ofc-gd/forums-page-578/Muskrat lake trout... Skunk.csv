548084,mike rousseau,2011-02-05 23:37:00,4661,Tried for some lake trout in Cobden today on muskrat lake with little success...  Other than two pike... Two rockbass... And a nice smallmouth... But no trout...  These lake trout seem very hard to locate and catch... But then again... I don't know lakers... I'm a walleye guy...  Any tips?
