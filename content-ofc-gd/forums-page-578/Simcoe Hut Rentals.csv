Any idea who I can call for a hut rental??  thanks for the input! adam"

547312,addy79,2011-02-03 14:47:00,573,"thanks for the input guys. Ended up going with Adam Goys Fishing out of Alcona (9th Line). great deal, $40/person including transportation and bait.  thanks Misfish!"
547313,addy79,2011-02-03 14:47:00,573,I'll report back any successes
547316,Mike Pike,2011-02-03 15:01:00,1332,Good luck Addy.  I usually book with Adam's Dad Terry who has his huts set up for perch.  Pretty sure Adam has his huts deep for lakers and whities.  Go get 'em!
547324,Hoppy,2011-02-03 15:26:00,95,Adams rental hut is real close to mine. I got a few whitefish and a bunch of perch (strange not the norm) in our hut so far so you should have some action.  Good luck Hoppy

547360,Billy Bob,2011-02-03 17:31:00,5865, NICE TJ....VERY NICE...THANK YOU...
547402,misfish,2011-02-03 20:01:00,29133, Terry used to do the deep water and always did well.Might of gotten a bit much for him after the years.He moved the huts all the time to be on fish.
547406,Hoppy,2011-02-03 20:18:00,95,  Tip up and 3way spreader & williams spoon  Hoppy
547424,misfish,2011-02-03 21:28:00,29133," Hoppy,it,s been many years since I used a spreader tipped with minnows.I did use the three way, then went to solid wire 4 way.Tip two hooks in the head and the other two in the tail.  Dont be afraid to use a mister champs aswell.Silver with blue prizm.  Good luck"
549076,addy79,2011-02-08 16:59:00,573,"So we ended up fishing on simcoe at the 9th line. rented a hut from Adam Goy, great guy! drove us out to our hut, which he had warmed up for us, set us up with bait, and gave us some useful pointers as were pretty green to fishing the hardwater. We were fishing in 93fow. not much action all day long, did manage to land a perch 90 feet down! didnt think they went that deep. Adam says the patterns have been strange this winter, he believes its cause the herring are starting to make a re surgence in the lake. we did notice that HUGE schools of fish started to show up on our sonar at around 3:30pm, we were anticipating some action at that time, but before we knew it, it was time to head home.  all in all, adam was a great guide. we will be back to give it another shot in a couple weeks.  JEEZ! fishing the hard water is tough..."
549079,misfish,2011-02-08 17:12:00,29133,"Yeah when your not mobile,it a tough fish. Glad to hear you gave him a try and will be going back."
