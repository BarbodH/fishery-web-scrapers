For comparison's sake, Future Shop sells it for $169.99.  I tried to find it in their online flyer, but it's not threre.  So, call your local store before you go over.  I'm a fan of Garmin, but at that price you can't go wrong.  http://www.tomtom.com/en_us/products/car-navigation/xl-335-series/"
548883,mercman,2011-02-08 01:21:00,7054,Bought one for the wife at CT for Christmas. Works great.

548937,Jonny,2011-02-08 02:48:00,1380,"The hardest workout I gave my Garmin Nuvi (new to me last year) was finding my way around Pittsburgh, Baltimore and Washington DC, on a holiday. It was absolutely indispensable. Even when I occasionally screwed up the instructions it gave me (completely my fault) it would give me a re-calculated route that worked.  They're an amazing machine.  I was driving an Interstate and wanted to find a liquor store in upper NY State before crossing back into Canada. I typed in ""liquor"" and it gave me directions to four or five liquor stores within a 10 mi. radius.  I wasn't chatting up pretty girls on street corners; my wife was with me."
548990,young_one,2011-02-08 05:16:00,620,Price match at FS or BB? get an additional 10% off the price difference!
549019,ADB,2011-02-08 13:42:00,444," Haha...but the the unit can tell you how to find the pretty girls (bars, strip clubs...)   If it was advertised then that would be sweet."
