My wife and I along with my son are finding it a little challenging on Simcoe right now as are others. I sure hope conditions get better for Tyler's tournament. Regardless, I will leave the atv at home and walk out with rubber boots for Tyler. Any updates on the lakes would be great. Thanks and tight lines."
