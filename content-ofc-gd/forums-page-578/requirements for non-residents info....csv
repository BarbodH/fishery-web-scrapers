We have passports, insurance on boats, some have resident state safe boater's certificates.  We all have our ""outdoor cards"" from Ontario...  Thanks For the info!!"
548760,Roy,2011-02-07 20:30:00,13728,As long as your boat(s) contain the safety items needed in your home State. You don't need a card for here unless you stay here for more than 45 days.
549017,Woodsman,2011-02-08 13:26:00,1286,"The ""no boaters card required"" Roy mentioned only applies to the boats owner. Us / State issued safe boaters cards are also acceptable."
549020,Roy,2011-02-08 13:44:00,13728, CORRECT!
