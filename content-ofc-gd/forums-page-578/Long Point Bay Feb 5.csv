548423,danbouck,2011-02-06 21:38:00,4380,"Thursday and Friday I was working on a new ice fishing project. I wanted a portable hut but spent that money on a sonar/gps for the boat   So I decided to make one.  Building a hut is easy enough but I wanted to be able to fold it down and carry it on my ATV   So I came up with a plan of making a light frame that would have all the pieces fold out to hold itself together. I was going to just make a tarp cover for it but I rolled into Princess auto and found a replacement tent cover for $10    Now I didn't have to worry about a door or windows  So anyways since it cost a whole $15 to build I wasn't too concerned if it didn't work. I tested it out on LPB on Saturday and it actually worked    Took 5 minutes to set up, blocked the wind and kept us warm.          As for the fishing we caught a bunch of perch, only a few good size but still a lot of fun  First fish was a monster lol            This was the site first thing in the morning.      In the afternoon I noticed that the wind picked up a bit and opened the door to have a look. Well I could barely see the ATV because of the whiteout   It's a good thing I had my compass because that's how we got back in. That was followed by a 3 hour drive home that was pretty scary in some spots."

548690,Roy,2011-02-07 16:56:00,13728,"Good job, Dan. UMMM, I have a crick in my neck from looking at that tent."
548693,MCTFisher9120,2011-02-07 17:04:00,3761,"Nice perch bud, the shelter looks pretty decent, how far down the hole could you see?  Thanks for sharing, MTBF"
548695,asdve23rveavwa,2011-02-07 17:08:00,2690,"Nice Dan, keeps the elements at bay, anyways.  Plus you will probably get a lot more use out of the sonar/gps!"
548696,danbouck,2011-02-07 17:10:00,4380,For sure Frankie  Mike - I could see bottom no problem
548697,asdve23rveavwa,2011-02-07 17:15:00,2690,"  Yeah, most place in LPB, I could stand on bottom and the top of my head, would be at the hole."
548826,skinny,2011-02-07 23:45:00,442,hey Dan I think you passed me when we were walking back in mu portable hut looks like a big green tent it's a 10x10 from pinical (spelt wrong but oh well) I just wish I had a way out and in other than feet or the taxi maybe next year
548829,Rich,2011-02-07 23:55:00,3927,"Great report Dan, but..   That is the result 90% of the time, on a good day out there.. can't believe you'd waste your time on the bay but I guess to each his own. lol"
548862,danbouck,2011-02-08 00:43:00,4380," I honestly couldn't see a damn thing coming back in, I'll have a look for you next time   It's a convenience thing Rich, I wanna check out the cottage and boat house so I might as well fish while I'm there. I still wanna hit your honey holes this year!"
