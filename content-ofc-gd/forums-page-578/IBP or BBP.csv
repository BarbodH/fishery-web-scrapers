547996,lovetofish,2011-02-05 15:55:00,500,"Never fished out of BBP before, just wondering how it is for parking and walking to get out to 80ft + compared to IBP.  Walking conditions are probably not much different I would imagine, but any info would be great.  Starting to feel these long walks dragging all the gear, not going to let that stop me.  Still have yet to catch my first simcoe laker too.  Is one better then the other for lakers?  thanks,  lovetofish"
548002,glen,2011-02-05 16:47:00,2641,I am not sure how the parking is a BBP.  But the walking sucks.  The snow was loose and slid with every step.  Hopefully it will pack down soon.  We need an on ice taxi service.
548033,lovetofish,2011-02-05 18:41:00,500,think i should bring cleets or snow shoes?
548034,Fisherman,2011-02-05 18:53:00,7201,"Helicopter on standby, someone mentioned the other day that some of the slush beds are over their boots and got wet to the knees,  maybe ""they"" are just a bit vertically challanged."
548037,Cudz,2011-02-05 19:23:00,2652,ibp was slow today.  perch and herring only
548046,Fisherman,2011-02-05 20:15:00,7201,"Cudz, hows the surface?  I may bring the ATV tomorrow just for a short run, perc is okay for me. Thanks."
548049,glen,2011-02-05 20:29:00,2641,"""think i should bring cleets or snow shoes?""  Cleats or snowshoes won't save you.  Try to get on a packed down trail.  Hope that helps."
548097,Cudz,2011-02-06 00:24:00,2652,There were lots of atvs out today but they all looked to be 4wd.  There is some pretty thick stuff out there I saw a few quads bog down a bit but nothing they couldn't power out of.  A guy in an older grand cherokee got stuck for about 2 hours but there were about 4 SUVs out there as well. It is soft in places dues to slush on snow but the ice thickness is very good (not great quality ice but lots of thickness). Hope that helps a bit.  For those walking it is not too bad.  Stay on the sled tracks and it is fine.
548100,asdve23rveavwa,2011-02-06 00:28:00,2690," What's the weather like up there now??  We are getting dumped on down here in Woodstock...just shovelled more snow than I did on the ""Storm Day"" (that turned out to be a joke)."
548103,Fisherman,2011-02-06 00:34:00,7201,"Thanks Cudz, it was just snowing about 15 minutes ago, now it has stopped, seems the storm is doing a wrap around."
548104,Cookslav,2011-02-06 00:44:00,1457," Same here.... Belwood was a slushy mess last weekend as well. Had to change my drawers as I walked out 25 yards then fell through the half inch crust LOL.... there was an easy 10"" of slush under the crust....man I thought I was gonna get wet!!!  But there was a solid 12"" of black under the slush."
548702,lovetofish,2011-02-07 17:42:00,500,Ended up going out of IBP.  Walking conditions were pretty tuff.  lots of loose snow and some areas with slush under the snow.  We started in 78 ft of water and starting catching perch.? and in 85 ft of water the same thing.? Never heard of perch being that deep before. Anyone else?  No lakers or whities.  Fished from 7:30am to 6:00pm.
548806,steelhedrmatt,2011-02-07 23:17:00,278,"I seen the one Jeep cherokee.  Was near my hut fishing with some buds.  12"" in my hole, and 10' away was still only 5"" of ice!!  Still too early to be out in that area with vehicles.  My hut is straight off the 7th line, just south of the park."
