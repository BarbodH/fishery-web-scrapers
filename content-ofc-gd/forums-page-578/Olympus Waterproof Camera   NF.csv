They also shoot HD video. Only a 5x optical + 5x digital zoom though. Might just have to order one. Check it out.  http://www.theshoppingchannel.com/endeca/search.do?keyword=628070&cm_re=A-_-STP-_-ITEM&cm_sp=STP-_-HP-_-OlympusTS  http://www.olympuscanada.com/cpg_section/product.asp?product=1496&page=overview"

548842,spinnerdoc,2011-02-08 00:07:00,556,"I have the Stylus 1050 SW. It's the older model but like jedi said it shoots great pics in and above camera. Perfect fishing camera, don't have to worry about it taking a dip in water."

With 14 MP resolution, the camera can give you very useful additional digital zoom (above the 5x optical), either in the camera or with your favourite graphics program."
