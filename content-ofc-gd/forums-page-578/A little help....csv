On that note its time again to search for a summer co-op position in my field (economics, finance or business development) that is located reasonably close to Guelph or Oshawa. If there are any opportunities out there that anyone knows of suitable for a 3rd year Economics & Finance student with some very solid experience I would greatly appreciate it if you could PM me the details. I'm not looking for any type of 'OFC deal' here - I'm just trying to make myself aware of as many opportunities as possible.  I'd be happy to discuss my experience and any specifics off the forum.  Thanks for any help - and mods if this is too far off topic feel free to give it the boot  Braden (kemper)"

The job market does seem better now than when I was doing co-op (the last 2-3 years). You should totally look into tackle companies lol, that'd be awesome if you can work for one."

549066,kemper,2011-02-08 16:19:00,2232," That is what I thought... but the co-op department has posted eleven (11) jobs since the beginning of January - There are something like 350 co-op students.    Thanks! I didn't even think about BDC even though my last job had me in contact with them (on the entrepreneur side, looking for money)  Looks like I got the application in just in time.    I did, although it looks like most of the federal jobs are in Ottawa this summer  Thanks Kemper"
