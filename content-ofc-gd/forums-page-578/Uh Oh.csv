That being said, when i came home today and opened the mailbox and a bunch of catalogs fell out.  The cabelas winter/holiday catalog, bass pro master catalog and spring hunting catalog.  I have a feeling i'm gonna be spending some time flipping through those and finding a lot of ""must haves"".  My mailman must have hated me as much as my wallet is going to.   ryan"

I used to love hunting ducks.  Good luck with your test,and remember don`t point your gun at any of the instructors LOL I remember at my test a couple of the guys picked up their guns and pointed them at the instructors LOL they were asked to leave!!"

I was up at my buddys deer camp this fall and did a watch or two with him.  It was great, hearing the sounds of the bush as everything around wakes up.  It was great to have the chance to go up before i started stocking up on gear, got to see whats needed and what isn't and stuff like that.  ryan"
