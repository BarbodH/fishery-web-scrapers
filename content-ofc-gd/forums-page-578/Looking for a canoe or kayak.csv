I was wondering if anyone has a canoe or kayak they just don't use anymore?  I probably wouldn't fish out of it much maybe a couple of times a year or haul it out for anyone who shows up for a visit and wants to go for a nice peaceful paddle on the lake sometime.  I'm not going to shell out alot cause I really won't use it much. I'm just putting this out there to see if anyone has something they don't use at all and are willing to part with.  I was not sure if this should really be posted in the classified section or not as I'm not selling anything, so if it gets moved to there I understand.  I just got winternet and I'm looking forward to getting back up to Bobcaygeon in the spring  PM if you would rather."
