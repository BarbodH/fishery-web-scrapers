548062,atvaholic,2011-02-05 21:52:00,271,"Does Any one have this reel? Any thoughts, comments?"
548076,bassjnkie,2011-02-05 23:12:00,1101,"I love my Daiwa reels. BUT when I bought the President and Supreme, I have to admit they are great reels. Very smooth, nice drag and made solid. Can't go wrong with them."
548081,Joeytier,2011-02-05 23:20:00,3990,"I've never used the supreme, but I own two Presidents and a Trion and they've yet to let me down.  Great reels for a good price."
548216,Alumacraft,2011-02-06 12:38:00,139,"I have 4 of the Supremes,1 Arbour,1 older President, and 1 older Solara. Never had an issue with any of them.Good solid reels and you can not beat the price. Get 1 and you'll probably get more.  Rob"
548249,atvaholic,2011-02-06 14:57:00,271,"Thanks All, I picked 1 up. If ll is well I will scoop another eventually.  What are the ""president"" and trion reels like compared to the supreme."
548269,DoubleDigits,2011-02-06 15:31:00,140, I believe the supreme is all magnesium body. So its lighter than the the president. Only diff I think.
548377,Alumacraft,2011-02-06 19:22:00,139,"Stick with the Supreme it's a much better reel than the President(not that there's anything wrong with the Pres.)The Supreme is lighter,better drag,and a higher retrieve ratio(6:3/1).  Rob"
548384,Sinker,2011-02-06 19:56:00,8692,"My fleet of reels is slowly turning into a fleet of pfleugers. I love 'em, and ya just can't beat the price! Not a single issue with any of mine at all.  S."
548389,Gregoire,2011-02-06 20:44:00,1397, Glad to hear positive reviews Pfluegers. I just purchased a Patriarch and can't wait to try it out.
548679,danbouck,2011-02-07 15:48:00,4380,"Love my Pfluegers, still can't get over how great the Trion is for such a low price"
548911,atvaholic,2011-02-08 02:01:00,271,"Do tell..I am considering a trion for a backup reel, but not sure what they are like."
549005,danbouck,2011-02-08 12:00:00,4380," It is just an all around great reel, very smooth. Just bought my wife one for her birthday"
549313,backbay,2011-02-09 05:07:00,773,"I've had a Trion in the boat for the last two years. I use it for smaller cranks and some top waters. The felt drag works smoothly, and the reel has been reliable. The only issue I've ever encountered is that occasionally, the bail would close if I really tried to muscle a cast. Great reel for the money."
549364,Homer Is King,2011-02-09 14:41:00,305,I love the Trions too.  I have several of the small ones (4725GX) that I use on my ice fishing rods.  I then put them on my kids panfish rods for the summer.  The kids put them through their paces and they have yet to let me down.  Plus the spare aluminum reel is a bonus.  For $40 at BPS you can't beat it!
