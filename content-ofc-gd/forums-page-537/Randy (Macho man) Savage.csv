585267,Rizzo,2011-05-20 18:45:00,4754,"that's odd. For some reason I thought he had died a while ago. Pretty sure his wife ""Miss Elizabeth"" has also died. I did notice his real last name was Poffo...at the same time as the Macho Man there was a wrestler by the name Leaping Lanny Poffo...any connection?? I can't believe I know this stuff. Don't tell my wife."
585268,Harrison,2011-05-20 18:47:00,2202,I wasn't expecting to read it was a car accident.
585269,misfish,2011-05-20 18:52:00,29133, Heart attack and crashed Phil.
585270,Grimace,2011-05-20 18:54:00,2020,Macho Man was Leaping Lanny Poffo's brother.  Classic Savage http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-EK-Mr6KbB8

585277,asdve23rveavwa,2011-05-20 19:18:00,2690,"I remember a Wrestlemania match between him and Ricky The Dragon Steamboat, that was unbelievable...haven't watched it in many years, but, that match still sticks out in my mind."
585279,GBW,2011-05-20 19:21:00,8460,I guess he won't be snapping into a slim jim and time soon.  I too thought he passed a little while ago.
585280,Mike01,2011-05-20 19:21:00,378,"sad news, certainly an entertainment legend.  I loved wrestling when I was younger, Jake ""The Snake"" Roberts was my fav."
585281,Lunatic,2011-05-20 19:34:00,536,macho man was my favourite growing up. big john stud was cool too.
585282,tizfun,2011-05-20 19:40:00,292,A pic of his him and his new wife of one year...
585283,Toronto_Angler,2011-05-20 19:46:00,698, MIss Elizabeth died of a drug overdose a few years back. Leaping Lanny Poffo was Macho Man's real life brother
585284,Carp,2011-05-20 19:47:00,1488,Sad news. He was always one of my favourite wrestlers.
585285,misfish,2011-05-20 19:50:00,29133," If it,s the same match Im thinking,it will always be one of the best."
585289,blaque,2011-05-20 20:04:00,2419, Never understood the concept of cracking a joke about someones death.  RIP Randy the macho man
585296,asdve23rveavwa,2011-05-20 20:26:00,2690," Probably was...unforgettable...the speed those two had in the ring during that match was amazing.  For a staged event, it still deserved respect!!"
585305,Lunatic,2011-05-20 21:01:00,536,"would that be the one where macho man jumps from top ropes with the ring bell to the dragons throat causing him to ""swallow his tongue"" and had to use sign language after? haha"
585314,misfish,2011-05-20 22:32:00,29133,Here ya go  
585326,rob v,2011-05-21 01:24:00,535,They sure don't make entertainment like that anymore!!   Simple mindless fun.   It doesn't get any better !!  RIP macho man
585341,GBW,2011-05-21 02:25:00,8460,"Like I said, I thought he passed years ago.  I also thought my comments would be taken with a grain of salt as this is about WWF/WWE."
