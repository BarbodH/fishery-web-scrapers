584763,Rod Caster,2011-05-19 02:21:00,5784," I turned the ""signature"" option off on my settings, but I noticed the link is on your profile.  My father paints nature, so I've got a soft spot for this kind of work.  Thx."
584767,Live2fish85,2011-05-19 02:23:00,1633,"That's some more great work bushart, I really like the pond hockey as it to brings back lots of memories. But the detail in the bll with the tornado is amazing geat job the grass looks awesome and I know it really difficult to draw so painting wouldn't be easier, plus every thing else on it is great. The pond hockey is awesome to really makes me wish I was a kid again like thoughs days no a worry in the world lol.  Thanks Chris"

584909,ehg,2011-05-19 15:04:00,2666,"Hey Bushart, thought i would share an oil painting i did a few years ago of a tornado. I call it ""A view from a hill"" "
584948,bushart,2011-05-19 16:50:00,2628,Looks great EHG---tornados sure give an artist lots of opportunities for different shades in the sky eh?  Sidenote---my wife's brother from Barrie went through that bad twister in the 80's  Since then she is petrified even at the hint of a summer storm now.
