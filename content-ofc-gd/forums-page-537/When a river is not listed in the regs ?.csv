575980,timmeh,2011-04-25 02:38:00,609,For any waterbody that is not listed in the exceptions section you follow the general regulations and open seasons for that zone.
575981,spinnerbaitking,2011-04-25 02:38:00,1622,"I would think you could follow the zone Reg's, but I'd send the MNR an E-mail, I was surprised at how quick I got a reply last year from the local C.O., just a thought, we should get out this spring once the bites on, come on Pike SBK"
575982,splashhopper,2011-04-25 02:41:00,2931, For sure Richard....  email sent to MNR too  thanks
575983,ctdd2006,2011-04-25 02:41:00,531,"  I would say yes....as long as it isn't in the special ""exceptions area"" of the regs it should be fair game.  Zone 16 says fish x is open April 1 - Sept 30 and that river falls in that zone...I say go casting and good luck."
576305,splashhopper,2011-04-26 03:09:00,2931, Thanks for the gut feel... I have sent an email to the MNR so I don;t get a fine though

584921,splashhopper,2011-05-19 15:54:00,2931,"Finally got an answer from the MNR on this topic:  Hello Ron,    Thank you for your enquiry. We apologize for the delay in responding to your email.    In specified waters (those listed in the regulations summary), there are exceptions to the general regulations established for each Zone. These include fish sanctuaries, bait and gear restrictions and different seasons, limits and size limits for some species. Anglers must check the exceptions for the waters where they will be fishing.    NOTE: Some waters are grouped with other waters that have the same regulatory exceptions and these will generally be listed under the proper name for the largest or most significant water body.  If there is nothing stated in the exceptions, then the regulations for the Zone apply.  We hope you find this information helpful. If you require further assistance, please contact the Natural Resources Information Centre at  1-800-667-1940.

584931,Grimace,2011-05-19 16:29:00,2020,That the way it has been as long as I can remember.  If the water body is not in exceptions than you go by zone regs.
584939,splashhopper,2011-05-19 16:37:00,2931,"No where in the regs book does it clarify this.  If I am mistaken, please ""copy and paste"" what I missed when i tried to find it.  Now we all have it in print right from the ministry's mouth. ( at least from the CO/administrator that answered it   )"

Check the exceptions to the general zone regulations for the waters or general area in which you will be fishing. •	 If there are any exceptions to the general rule for the Zone, you must comply with those exceptions   So if there are no exceptions to the general zone regulations for that body of water don't use any and stick with the general zone regulations.  http://www.mnr.gov.on.ca/stdprodconsume/groups/lr/@mnr/@letsfish/documents/document/198218.pdf"

584976,Spiel,2011-05-19 17:33:00,9065, Pretty much what I've read in the regs for 40 plus years.
584987,BillM,2011-05-19 18:03:00,17367,I didn't think the regs were this hard to figure out.  If it's not listed in the exceptions the standard rules apply for the zone.
