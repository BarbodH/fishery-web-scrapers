584477,troutologist,2011-05-18 14:06:00,951,"To get your hands on an ulu send an email to the Co-op manager in a smaller town. You will get charged 5-10x more in Iqaluit for the same thing.  Great trip, hope to get to Pang myself next winter for a char netting session."
584479,adempsey,2011-05-18 14:10:00,1498,Nice!  I still remember learning about Pangnirtung in Grade 8 geography class! Ha!
584514,Homer Is King,2011-05-18 15:36:00,305,"Awesome adventure!  Great report!  Thanks for sharing.  ""Trip of a lifetime"" by far!"
584515,DRIFTER_016,2011-05-18 15:38:00,10439, Shouldn't be hard to find an ULU up here. I actually have a souvenier one sitting on my bookshelf in the living room.
584536,Mike Pike,2011-05-18 16:50:00,1332,"Wow, so isolated!  And what harsh conditions they must live with everyday.  What an experience you must have had and thanks for posting some of it for us!"
584543,ehg,2011-05-18 17:10:00,2666,"Looks like an incredible life experience. That char meat is so red it looks like fire. It would be a sushi bar's dream, no wonder you were eating it raw.  That baby seal looks like it would make a great pet. Looks quite alive in that picture! "
584545,BIG FISH,2011-05-18 17:13:00,54,"thanks for all the awesome comments guys    for those of you interested in the ulu (knife) i would check out the iqaluit sell/swap group on facebook or even the pangnirtung sell/swap group also on facebook and see if someone can ship you one they are by far the sharpest knife i have used. i brought back almost a dozen of em for friends and family and kept 4 for my self lol  about the baby seal its an absolute delicassy. they love the baby seal meat, and also the fur is very warm i purchased a pair of baby seal skin mitts when i was up there and my hands never got cold even in the harshest arctic weather ( got to about -50)  the inuit way of living is a lot different then what were used to down south, when an inuit boy reaches a certain age as a right of passage into manhood they have to kill a baby seal, we brought this guy back alive for the hunters grandson. i got to play around with the thing for a good two hours on the ride back home   i was very lucky to get the chance to go up there as my cousin is a nurse and got called up there for some work. she will be returning to ontario shortly as her work is done. if she wasnt there then there would be no way i could go up there i think the hotel is like 250$ a night or something.  i also got to see a polar bear unfortunately no pics as my camera was frozen (ran into this problem many of times lol) we were seal hunting at the floe edge and the hunter pointed it out to me. i could barely see it so we hopped on the ski-doo and drove right up close to it i would say about 30 yards away from it. it ran away from us and we chased it to the floe edge and it jumped into the water. the biggest most magnificent most beatifull creature i have ever seen  the arctic char was the most clean and pure fish i have ever tasted, one of the hunters explained the life cycle to me (they dont speak much english so this is what i understood)the char live in the salt water and eat and get big, then in the fall they migrate up the rivers to spawn after they spawn they keep going up river and they make there way up into the freshwater moutain lakes for winter, when the big spring meltoff starts and all the snow and ice melts they get washed back into the ocean, and get big for a couple months and then repeat the process  heres a picture of my ulu's, a toy owl made out of baby seal skin, some rocks from the arctic circle and by far my most prized possesion my inuit fishing rod  "
584550,EC1,2011-05-18 17:30:00,930,"That looks like an amazing trip! The fish looks really good, and had you not said you were baby seal hunting, I would have thought you domesticated it..Lol."
584573,Jds63,2011-05-18 18:43:00,1365,wow what an incredible trip and photos .... thanks
584574,Guest gbfisher,2011-05-18 18:58:00,0,  He kinda looks like he knows he's going to be sh.your lunch....   
584607,blaque,2011-05-18 20:47:00,2419, Call me whatever name in the books you would like...........there is absolutely no chance i could lay a finger on that little furball.
584637,Guest gbfisher,2011-05-18 22:17:00,0,Everyone is entitled. I'd take the wee fur ball home to but I'm not sure he'd grow up to be so nice and cuddly.
584925,Cast-Away,2011-05-19 16:11:00,790,"What did the baby seal order when it walked into the bar? Bartender, I will have anything other than a Canadian Club!"

584224,BIG FISH,2011-05-17 20:46:00,54,i recently had a chance to travel to a small fishing/hunting town called pangnirtung on baffin island. the goal was to do some fishing and hunting and learn about the inuit way of life. it was an experience of a lifetime and i hope to do it again someday. ill let the pics do the talking    top of the mountain above the small town (mount duval)   the fishing was awesome they had about 5 feet of ice and the arctic char are everywhere        the fish are so fresh and clean like no other fish iver ever caught the meat is by far the best tasting fish iver ever had i was eating it raw as i was cleaning them and it tasted awesome    also got to do some hunting the target was baby seal took us two days but we finally got one    
584228,mercman,2011-05-17 20:53:00,7054,"That my friend, is a trip of a lifetime Keep the pics and the memories with you always. Thanks for sharing this experience with us. You are a lucky man, my friend.  paul  "

That red meat looks like candy!  Edit: those inuit skinning knives are amazing. My brother brought me one back from Kuujuurapik... sharp as anything"
584239,asdve23rveavwa,2011-05-17 21:15:00,2690,"Wow, what a unique report!!  Truly something we don't see too often on here.  That char actually made my stomach growl. I envy you the experience"

584245,crossover,2011-05-17 21:40:00,172,why a baby seal?

584262,12footspringbok,2011-05-17 22:22:00,459,Colour of that meat is crazy red! I have a pilot friend that works out of yellowknife. I asked him what arctic char tasted like. He said its like lays potatoe chips once you start you can't stop till its all gone...LOL Thanks for sharing!
584264,Rich Clemens,2011-05-17 22:31:00,3131,Now that's trip I'd like to make someday.   Thanks for sharing.

584277,irishfield,2011-05-17 22:56:00,26272,Same reason people eat Veal !   What a great trip fella... gonna be hard to beat that one!
584300,lookinforwalleye,2011-05-18 00:03:00,4399,Uber Cool!!!  If you don`t mind me asking how did you come to get the chance to go to the Artic?
584403,hawk-eye,2011-05-18 05:16:00,141,"  I have only seen them on tv, Id love to get my hands on one. Any ideas where?"
584413,solopaddler,2011-05-18 09:08:00,8605," Here. Really great price but they only ship to the states.  http://www.knives.net/ULUPAGE.htm  You could also try try pm'ing Drifter_016 up in Yellowknife, he may be able to track one down for you."
584419,blue pickeral,2011-05-18 10:13:00,267," Because when you are hunting food - basic sustenance - you aren't choosey. Any meat keeps you alive for a couple more days. Cuteness doesn't enter the picture. Yes, there are stores, but the prices are often five to six times more than we pay in the south due to food being flown or barged in.  As for the ulu knife, best chance of getting one would be in Iqaluit. Largely an Inuit tool. Try contacting someone up there who can check the Northern store. Picked one up at the Hudson's Bay store years ago, but HBC has been sold. Often locals will make them out of scrap sheet metal. Great for cutting up pizza.  Nice trip!"
584436,Rod Caster,2011-05-18 11:45:00,5784, That would slice up a Char Pie is seconds. hahah. Good advice about the Northern Store or contacting someone up north... probably your best bet.
584437,Grimace,2011-05-18 11:46:00,2020,Really cool.
584442,Roy,2011-05-18 11:58:00,13728,You're living the dream. Thanks for sharing.
584444,tb4me,2011-05-18 12:05:00,3295,nice!!! Thanks for the report
584448,blaque,2011-05-18 12:35:00,2419,I dont think he ate the seal........he meant he was hunting to find one.  Why would he eat a baby seal when he had a cutting board full of fish.
584451,Moosebunk,2011-05-18 12:39:00,3970,Defining life experience for ya BIG FISH!  A pleasure to see just a glimpse of it in your report.  Hope time brings you more chances like that one.  Second pic was my favorite.
