584204,canadadude,2011-05-17 19:40:00,769,"clarified butter is great, by clarifying the butter you can bring it to a higher tempeature without burning"
584206,Roe Bag,2011-05-17 19:42:00,246,    My mother in law used to save all of her bacon grease. She would strain it while it was still warm. Then keep it in the fridge in a big tomato juice can. It was strictly for frying fish. Yum yum!! Bless her soul. It was the best fish I ever tasted.
584287,bigbuck,2011-05-17 23:16:00,2449,"Deep frying, canola oil is best all around. Lard is the tastiest but not healthy and vegetable shortening is the biggest no no of all (think trans fats). Peanut is good but due to allergies you have to be careful who you use it around. Now deep fried in canola oil with some bacon grease.............."
584355,Abberz,2011-05-18 01:47:00,140,"Duck fat is the bomb.....Peanut oil is a little more economical, and all I use however."
584485,Beans,2011-05-18 14:17:00,3339,Crisco vegetable oil (soybean oil) and a bit of butter for pan-frying fish...  I use peanut oil mainly for my Chinese stir-fries and EVOO for salads...
584508,troutologist,2011-05-18 15:24:00,951,"I like 2/3 lard and 1/3 butter for the too few shore lunches I have these days. At home its usually canola.  Sometimes a panfry in butter is a good change too.  The mess kit is packed and ready for this weekend...lard, batter, Bush's beans, spuds, onions, peppers and fruit cups. And no beer!!  Introducing a buddies 2 youngsters to the shore lunch tradition...should be a good one."
584592,NANUK,2011-05-18 19:50:00,797,Cotton seed oil for deep frying. taste good and has a high smoke point.
584784,walleyejack,2011-05-19 02:46:00,358,"Mobil 1 Synthetic,high temp tolerance,and lasts forever !  Sometimes I load the pan up with butter and shot of olive oil,works pretty good for me."

584815,dhickey,2011-05-19 04:35:00,1038,Heres one for you guys. A chef told me about this  	GOOSE OIL 	AWESUM!!!  Pick up a goose when they are on sale the meet is good and the oil left in the bottom of the pan is one of the heathest natural oils you can cook with.  sliced potatos are out of this world.  pan fry fish with 2 table spoons of goose oil and what ever spices you like   YUMM..  Forgot to mention that you can keep the oil in the fridge untill you use it up  WITCH WONT BE LONG.
584817,Sinker,2011-05-19 04:48:00,8692," Same here. As long as your not eating fish every day, that is fine for your health IMO. Just don't be frying your food every day.     I do this too. I ALWAYS have some bacon grease on hand.  S."
584007,skinny,2011-05-17 10:45:00,442,i have been cheap and I also think I switched oil without noticing it. I think when I started iused no mame canola and now switched to vegetable. Y know the oil you use will change the tase so looking for types and names
584009,Billy Bob,2011-05-17 10:49:00,5865,I purchase a GALLON of Canola Oil from Sam's Club about twice a year...It's better for you heart.
584010,mercman,2011-05-17 10:51:00,7054,i use a 50/50 mixture of canola and extra virgin olive oil.
584013,Musky or Specks,2011-05-17 11:10:00,2710,4 letters baby...... L  A  R  D  Not that good for ya but nothing taste better
584016,Roy,2011-05-17 11:20:00,13728,"It'll depend on whether you're pan frying, deep frying etc... Aside from the taste, different oils burn at different temperatures. What do you want to do? You're going to need oils with high smoke points. Canola works as does peanut, safflower and sunflower."
584017,Mike01,2011-05-17 11:29:00,378,"If I'm doing fish I like to use canola mixed with a small amount of butter, just for some added flavour.  For general frying I always use just straight canola."
584019,skinny,2011-05-17 11:39:00,442,oh ya should have stated this is deep frying
584022,dave524,2011-05-17 11:50:00,4508,"I prefer to use a few bricks of all vegetable shortening rather than a liquid oil, just works better for me. It will set up when cool , find that convenient and better texture to fried foods."
584023,danbouck,2011-05-17 11:52:00,4380, smart idea
584024,Muskieman,2011-05-17 11:53:00,2472,PURE LARD STRAIGHT FROM THE PIG'S  I always use my Turkey Pot for deepfrying ... and the lard is way better in my opinion... end result is a less greasy and crispier fillet or wing or whatever... more costly than conventional oil but lasts longer well worth the extra $.  Randy 
584027,dannyboy,2011-05-17 12:20:00,367,Peanut oil here for deep frying.  Dan
584028,splashhopper,2011-05-17 12:26:00,2931,Let me ask my wife. I don't know where the kitchen is.
584041,pikehunter,2011-05-17 12:57:00,1659,"   Iv'e had fries done in peanut oil before, fantastic! Some things at home we use a mixture of canola with olive oil and for fish usually canola but only because there is no other oil in the house. For fried eggs though there is nothing better than frying them in a little bit of bacon grease from the 1/2 dozen strips cooked in a separate frying pan."
584046,pics,2011-05-17 13:07:00,1268,"Canola all the way...if you are going to deep fry on a regular basis it's the best for your heart and  health....otherwise if you only do it a few times a year, lard would be ok.........."
584077,NAW,2011-05-17 14:15:00,4022,"My mother in-law tried to convince me to use Coconut Butter fom pan frying..  Still have 3/4 jar in the cupboard.  It tastes great, but the breading sucks up all the oil, and you have keep loading up the pan.  Expensive too, you can only by it in the health food section.  She told me it was a healthier way to cook, but you end up eating so much oil because it all gets soaked up in the breading.  I generally use Canola oil.  But have used several different types (veggie, and peanut) and I can't really taste that much of a difference."
584080,10point,2011-05-17 14:27:00,165,Peanut oil here.
584082,Headhunter,2011-05-17 14:33:00,5703,"Lard! As for using Olive oil, well, I think it adds some flavour to what your cooking, which can be a good thing, but not for deep frying. HH"
584110,Billy Bob,2011-05-17 15:10:00,5865,"I agree with you guys about using LARD.....BEST TASTING for deep frying..but not good for the rest of the body..  Remember years ago, going to the county fair and getting those delicious Freedom Fries....and now they just don't taste as good....reason...they no longer use LARD.....if I'm going to do a shore lunch I bring a brick of LARD because it's so much easier to work with then bottles of oil.  Bob"
584113,skinny,2011-05-17 15:20:00,442,ok I keep hearing lard and i'm sure it's great but bad isn't everything anyone mixing lard and ???? might try the penut oil thing too
584117,Billy Bob,2011-05-17 15:23:00,5865, The reason not to use LARD is it's plain old pig FAT....so mixing it with anything will only kill the taste somewhat while still getting all the bad stuff associated with LARD...if you're going to use LARD...then just use it occasionally and enjoy the special treat.
584122,Lip-ripper,2011-05-17 15:33:00,228,I sometimes cook fish in bacon grease... yummy!
584147,Mike01,2011-05-17 16:18:00,378,"I had the most amazing fries done in duck fat, man where they ever good."

584158,Spiel,2011-05-17 16:46:00,9065,"My deep fryer is always loaded with lard, mind ya I don't use it often. Pan fried, well it's hard to beat salt pork for fish but again, I only do so on occasion."
584200,manitoubass2,2011-05-17 19:30:00,11391,"I use canola, veg and bacon grease. Just depends on my mood/whats available.  I love olive oil for other applications, but burns at a low temp and isn't good for frying fish.  I once cooked some walleye in just pure butter, and man was it tasty. Big time pain in the but for doing up more than a few pieces though. Had to rewash the pan after each batch."
