Didn't really put up a fight, but it had my knees trembling, probably because I didn't expect to catch a fish like this with the CN Tower in sight. Didn't have my measuring tape with me but it's no a PB or anything. Shortly after I had snagged my favourite coloured lure. Stayed for about 3 hours. While I didn't catch anything else, I had seen 3 more pike (one which followed), a HUGE carp, probably pushing 25 pounds, and either a bass or bowfin.    Also I was surpised to see these ducks, only seen them in Europe:    All in all it was a nice warm day to be out. Only saw one other fisherman."
