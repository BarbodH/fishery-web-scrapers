584753,GreenCanada,2011-05-19 02:01:00,375,"  I'm certain I know the store, if you are talking about one in Guelph. I personally haven't been back to Hook Line and Sinker / The First Cast Fly Shop  in Guelph because of the elitist attitude of the owner there. I have been in on countless occasions and every time I attempt to ask a question I get the impression he thinks I'm an idiot who is wasting his time, not a customer and fellow angler who is interested in learning more and buying product. The store is nicely laid out and very well stocked, though the prices aren't great. I would shop there, except I can't stand supporting someone who is as disrespectful and impatient as he is.  Kingsway is by far the best and to me the only option in Guelph for quality customer service."

I had a few bad first experiences at Natural Sports on my first dozen or so trips there.  Rainbow is decent, but prices on most items is too high.  Recently Natural has won my business as I've discovered an extremely helpful employee who fishes the same way I do and likes to talk about the same stuff and is extremely helpful - John.  That name will mean something to one member of these boards in particular.  Dave didn't start offering me customer service until he saw I was driving an Escalade one day (after I had been in there and ignored on multiple occasions despite clearly having questions to ask).  Regardless, Natural in general has been getting progressively better for me and the prices are extremely good (cheaper than big box on many items and they have a full selection - including all loomis and live target)."

Great stories and fish talk (huge plus for me)  Prices I'd say are average, some things are great, others are what you'd expect, some of the higher end bass cranks and etc can be pretty high, but if you get to know them, you'll always leave with some free gear.

584296,laszlo,2011-05-17 23:51:00,487,I go to 4 different tackle shops depending on what type of fishing I plan on doing that weekend.
584390,BillsTheBassMan,2011-05-18 03:33:00,932," Nope, in business you have to call it like you see it and customer service/a positive store experience is often all that divides stores from each other (in Natural's case they have superior prices to most tackle shops and an extensive product line).  Reminds me of a certain fly shop where I was getting grilled for buying live bait when I was taking my 6 year old nephew fishing (do you have a license, what are you fishing for, where are you fishing etc) - never been back and told more than a few people about it.  This is the basics on how people gather a reputation.  When I'm in a tackle shop 3 times per week for 5-6 months straight, purchasing something on each trip and I don't get offered service until someone happens to see that I'm driving a $90K Vehicle because they're fixing the kayak display out front, then it's just a fact as to why I'm getting service.  What was the service?  A pitch on a $550 Loomis rod while I was looking at a handful of $5-$10 lures.  More than enough coincidences to make that situation a fact.  Dave's service continues to be lacking despite my handful of receipts totaling roughly $800 since the beginning of April.  Regardless, it should be kept in context that Natural is my tackle shop of choice, one employee didn't ruin it for me, and one helped it incredibly.  Their prices are good, their selection is good, and there just aren't many top notch options in the KW area.  It should also be mentioned that the younger staff at Natural are eager to help and quite knowledgeable.  They're generally always the first to give you a hand.  I find it somewhat interesting Natural Sports wasn't mentioned at all in the dozens of posts on this thread before mine.  Continuing with the thread, outside of KW, I've had good experiences at Elwood Epps, Angling Outfitters, and Tall Tales in Cambridge (a big shout out to the owner who was extremely friendly and helpful the one time that I happened by the shop).  Rainbow Sports (despite having inflated prices on smaller items like lures and line) have good service and EXTREMELY knowledgeable upper management and competitive pricing on soft baits and bigger items."

376995,solopaddler,2009-08-27 01:40:00,8605,"There's tons of great shops out there. When I lived in Dundas I used to give Steve Burns in Burlington a fair bit of business. One day I went in looking for a very specific Avid rod I wanted. He didn't have it, but he handed me the catalogue and said ""Look it over at home, let me know which rod you want and you can have it at my cost"".  Sweet thought I. I thanked him and left. A week later I was back in the store with a list of six different St. Croix rods I wanted LOL! There was a noticable pause, then he says ""sure no problem bud"". All at his cost. No way was I expecting that at all.  On another note since moving to Grimsby I've frequented Grimsby Tackle a fair bit. I can see why many of you guys like the place, their selection is very good. On the downside I'm guessing the dude behind the counter needs to get to know you before opening up. He's always uncomfortably silent and not overly friendly when I've been in there."

380790,Devious,2009-09-08 13:58:00,49, The Kingston Gardiners road location has its fishing department run by a guy who used to own a local fishing store in Kingston.  He brings in a huge amount of stuff that typical Canadian tires don't have so were a little spoiled in Kingston...sometimes its a little expensive but at least the selection is there.  Sadly enough most of my fishing tackle is purchased in bulk down in the US as I simply cant afford the quality of stuff I like to fish and buy it consistently up here.  I will recommend Quinte Outdoors which is on the 62 exit north of belleville....I got all my crutial casting rods there for $145 and find their rod prices are significantly cheaper then anywhere....including the US.

375254,Sinker,2009-08-22 14:07:00,8692,"I've been to BPS twice now, and left with nothing both times. I won't be back there, no need to go that far for nothing........even if it saves me a few bucks, I'd rather stay close to home.  If I need salmon gear I hit up Gagnons. Musky gear its tightlines or Marks Worm Wearhouse. Anything else I need I can usually get at CT in Lindsay........they have a wicked fishing section.  I also do a lot of dealings with Kawartha Bait and Tackle. Gerry will get you anything you want in short order.......if he doesn't have it. He also makes some nice custom spinners in there. Just ask if you don't see it, and he will either make it, or get it in for you. He doesn't have a pile of stuff, but the stuff he has is what you need.  I've been meaning to stop in at Hirks for ages now, but still haven't been in there. I have to check it out.  S."
375258,wask,2009-08-22 14:24:00,174,"Admittedly, I hit BPS more than the others just because I end up there a few times a year with my wife because she loves shopping that mall it is attached to.  For local tackle though they guys at Bridgenorth Sports are Marine are the best around.  I've never made it all the way up to Bobcaygeon to KLO, but BSM carries most everything I fish with and they are friendly fellas.  I find their prices to be a hair high, but in the end, if I need something its cheaper than going all the way to Vaughan from Ptbo.  Honestly, most of my hardbaits come from antique lure collectors who sell the fishables cheap that they get out of their field finds.  That's the cheapest way to go for me"
375285,scuro2,2009-08-22 17:29:00,904," That would be my pick. Jocelyn is great but so are the rest of the crew. You gotta love the banter between Jocelyn and Sherm, it always puts a smile on my face when you hear Sherm bugging Jocelyn about not having ordered something. Jos is great with newbies, he goes that extra mile to build up that customer base, and will spend the time pointing out spots on a lake to fish, lures to use, and suitable tackle. He showed me the ropes a decade ago.  I do try to stop in every fishing store that I can. I have a thing for spoons."

Further north, Gramps just north of Marten River and Pop's in Temagami are both good shops. I have also been into Romakko's in Sudbury once and was very impressed. Jack."
374628,Jonaton,2009-08-20 20:21:00,72,"As I mostly fish musky I really like the selection of stuff JB's has, the prices for of lot of the produts not so much. Their rods and reels are priced very decently but some of their lures are absurdly expensive. I was looking at a shallow invader the other day that was $15.99 at LeBarons and $20.99 for the exact same model at JB's. However in the end JB's has far far more musky tackle than anywhere else I have ever been, so until a semi local musky specific store opens they'll still get a good chunk of my business."

374659,Bernie66,2009-08-20 21:53:00,123,"If you want sound fishing advice and good customer service, buy at your local shops.  They depend on good customer relations for their business.  As for BPS, they are only good during their spring sale.  One more customer, one less customer, they don't care.  You are nothing to them.  IMO they have the worst customer service around (couple of ignorant rednecks on staff and one of them is a manager).  A few shops not mentioned around the GTA.  -Angling Specialties in TO -Fishing Depot in Rexdale -Gagnon Sports in Oshawa"
374661,JohnF,2009-08-20 21:56:00,3494, I've had better experiences with them. They really seem to try hard to get me what I want if they don't have it. Of course I tend to hide out there when I tell my office I'm out on appointments. Mebbe they're just getting used to me. I find their prices very good and the selection suits me at least as well as Bass Pro.  JF

Jos is definetly the man when it comes to electronics and is willing to help"
374703,Gerritt,2009-08-20 23:13:00,6129,Angling Outfitters for sure! Jos is the best.. not to mention their pricing is fair! I drive from the Hamilton area to see them in Woodstock... Bills Bait n Tackle is good too... but their selection pales in comparison to Angling Outfitters... There is a reason Angling Outfitters is the number one Lowrance dealer in Canada!  I wish I could bring myself to shop at other fishing stores local to me... But either their customer service sucks or their prices are higher then most in the market and wont budge when shown their competition in LOWER... it is as if they could care less and wait for some other sucker to walk through the door...    Angling Outfitters and Bill's Bait N' Tackle all the way!  G
374706,crappieperchhunter,2009-08-20 23:14:00,2582, I don't even think it's the best tackle shop in Caygeon. You wouldn't be related to the owner's would you   Been going to Mark's Worm Warehouse out on the highway for years. KLO has nothing on him. I went in KLO once when it first opened. Nice enough fellow in there and I got a free donut from him. I wish them luck...but seriously even BUCKEYE has more stuff and so does  the little convenience store out beside Nogies creek.  So I would rank KLO 4th in Bobcaygeon.  You are related to the owner... right
374707,ColdH20guy,2009-08-20 23:18:00,312,Ellwood Epps just north of Orillia..great selection..lower prices than the 'other one in Orillia'....great advice too!
374713,Radnine,2009-08-20 23:45:00,1538,"I am always surprised at the amount of stuff that Buckeye does have. KLO must be the new place on the main drag (just in from the side walk) eh? I stopped in quickly for a look back in July. Good small town tackle shops are hard to find, but there is a good little shop in Burke's Falls. Nobody has mentioned Epps on Hwy 11, aren't they kind of iconic? (note: it got mentioned while I was typing, see above) Jim"

Frank is a friendly enough guy and will try to get anything you want. Prices are obviously higher than Lebaron or BPS but there is something to be said for friendly, local service."
374792,crappieperchhunter,2009-08-21 10:57:00,2582, Very impressed with this place as well. It is not in my fishing area so I was only in there once while passing through 2 summers ago. Could not believe the amount of stuff they carried. If it was in my area I would be a regular for sure.
374838,Garnet,2009-08-21 13:05:00,2056,It would be better if there was a tackle store I didn't like. Hirk's is doing a good job.  Garnet
374865,Harrison,2009-08-21 13:44:00,2202," Big boys buy into the millions with a distributor therefore they get better pricing.  The profit margin is usually the same between the bigs and littles  +/- a little.  There is something to be said for the $5 difference though, pretty hard to put a value on experienced advice and guidance from those who truly care about their business.  Tightlines has always been my favorite for over 20yrs now.  My bro and I still joke about the time I went to BPS and asked where the keel weights were and the guy walked me over to the anchors."
374492,Roger,2009-08-20 14:15:00,2,"Sometimes bigger is not always better. So what makes your favourite tackle shop so great?. Is it selection,price,the people,the location, please explain. One of my favourites is Kawartha Lakes Outdoors in Bobcaygeon because of the unique line of baits you don't see anywhere else and the knowledge from behind the counter is a big plus."

374521,iCarp,2009-08-20 15:48:00,50,"As a smaller retailer myself, I'm biased, but I think it's important to support others in your local community if possible.  I find I generally get better and more knowledgeable service from the local shops.  Their stock is geared to the area.  Helping to keep them in business with my purchases means they'll be there for anglers who can't or don't want to spend the time and money getting to BPS.  A lot of the younger guys around here would be screwed if the local shops closed, and they're the future of the sport.  Here in Hamilton Bill's Bait & Tackle gets my vote.  Great service and prices from guys who know what they're talking about.  I once had a problem with a rod that was under a life-time warranty.  I got better service from Greg at Bill's Bait & Tackle than from the big store, and the specific guy in that big store, that sold it to me in the first place.  Small is better!"

When ya buy a bunch, Ive had times where a free one or two have been kicked in  And a free hat a time or two. Try that at a BPS or Gander Mountain. And try asking one of the BPS guys the latest trends out on the lake. Ya get blank stares or lines of general Bull just so they can hear themselves talk, or they regurgitate the local fishing hotline that they called before their shift lol. Talk to owners of small shops, they are genuinely interested in getting you into fish so you come back to their shop, not just a retail guy selling you something that isnt terribly interested in the stake of the company. I dont boycott the big box stores, they have their place in a pinch.......but im much more interested and look forward to visiting a shoppe over a gander."

374616,Canuck2fan,2009-08-20 19:31:00,1444," Yeah they are great as long as you only want what they have on the shelves.... If you need something they are out of or want them to order something new you are going to wait. Then just for fun go back when they say it will be in the first time. Then get the lame a$$ excuse of why it's not there. Then wait again. Reread the last two sentences twice and go through the same motions. Then go back for the FOURTH time that they TOLD you NO QUESTION it will be there only to be told nope it isn't here....  That is when you get yelled at as the customer because you stop won't riding their butt over this until you get it.... I then informed the owner that the only reason I even bothered to come back for the fourth time is that you told me it would be HERE NO QUESTION. Since it isn't how about refund for my time and gas money because I was dumb enough to believe you four times. That got a blank stare and no answer.... But those were only my experiences both when I wanted clip on lights they had just sold out of minutes before I arrived because the empty box was still there. 2 week later still no clip lights. Lebaron I ordered on the Monday and got them in time to take them friday night plus about 120 bucks worth of other stuff I would have bought at The Fishing Store even though when I did the math it would have cost me about 20% more because I agree we are lucky to have any type of fishing store in a town this size.... The second time it was with frozen spawn so I could tie it myself, after the fourth visit I just gave up and drove to KW to get some.  After all that I still try to shop there but if ain't on the shelf they aren't going to work very hard to get it for you."
374621,Hooked,2009-08-20 19:46:00,891,"I buy 99% of my stuff from Grimsby Tackle.  Great prices, actually sometimes ludicrous.  Thats why they call the owner crazy Adrian, haha.  They are also very friendly and knowledgeable."
374624,Bob,2009-08-20 20:15:00,370,"I like the Trading Post here in Elliot Lake.  It's 5 minutes from my door and the folks are great.  If they don't have something you want, they'll include it on their next order (providing their suppliers have it available).  Of course they won't put in a special order, that would cost extra for shipping but they do regular orders once or twice a week so the wait usually isn't too long.  Their selection of fishing gear is better than CTC and their prices are better on a lot of their stuff.  Of course my only options aside from those stated are 100 miles to Sudbury or 130 miles to the Soo."
