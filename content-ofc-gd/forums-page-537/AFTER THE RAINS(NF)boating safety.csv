585215,BITEME,2011-05-20 13:23:00,1968,Hey just a heads up for anyone hitting the Big O around Oakville/Bronte  We have experienced a massive washout in the river and it is all over the Lake in our area as off last night out to about 130 feet could be allot more and widespread today. Keep a watchful eye if you are cruising around at whatever speed there are allot of Boat killers out there that will put a real dent in your weekend.  Cheers Peter
