584408,young_one,2011-05-18 08:43:00,620,"As many of you know I'm super jet lagged from my recent trip to China, I decided to take advantage of my 3AM wakeup schedule. Went fishing with fellow member Kevin, the forecast was calling for 25km winds and light shower. A bumpy ride to our spot and the bite was on fire starting 8-9ish, at the peak period I had missed multiple consecutive bites within seconds. My 30LB byers anchor really held nicely, but a pain in the @ss to pulled it backup for my anchor boy.    Depth: 75~80 FOW Lure: William 1/2, Bad Boy, Jigging Raps Colour: Anything green! Weather: Overcast Surface Temperature: ~41F Notes: Saw quite a few dying smelt on the surface.     To my surprise we didn't see anyone jig up a Laker, I had my trolling stuff ready but didn't want to give up the hot whitie bite.       I've always had good luck with William W60 Silver Electric Blue, behind a dipsy diver. The live-forage Smelt looks real good to match the hatch. Anyone has recommendation for laker trolling lures?    We had over a dozen fish landed and many lost!  "

584421,misfish,2011-05-18 10:38:00,29133," Silver Fox flutter spoons.Assortment of colours. Ones that worked for me were the Orange prizm on Silver,light blue aswell. Watermellon is a good go to also. Expect alot of herring hook ups.Crazy things will hit anything.1.2-1.5 mph  I cant see the pics,but great report. If I get my tuck back by the weeked,I,ll be heading over that way."
