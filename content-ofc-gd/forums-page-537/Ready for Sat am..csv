584648,grt1,2011-05-18 22:40:00,638,I'm heading to the annual meeting of the Eagle Lake Hookers Club in Vermilion Bay on Eagle Lake tomorrow morning/ As the original poster did his check list so did I.  Friday morning should see us heading into Clearwater Lake for lake trout. Then on Saturday its walleye time.  Those brewskis on the front porch of the cabin are going to taste great.
