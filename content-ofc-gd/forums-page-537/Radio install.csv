584955,mistaredone,2011-05-19 17:04:00,913,"I'm looking to install my old car deck and speakers on my boat.  Question?  When running the red, yellow and back wires to the battery do I need a breaker?  Also is it ok to hook up 14 gage wire to a battery?  All the battery rings I saw in the store were rated for 10-12 Gage wire.  Thanks"
584970,bigbuck,2011-05-19 17:27:00,2449,"You don't need a circuit breaker. But make sure you have fuses on the + leads to the battery. Make sure you have a cover for the stereo, one splash of water on it and it will be toast. Your speakers won't last too long, the paper in automotive speakers will degrade in a season or two. There are relatively cheap marine grade speakers available, BassPro is pretty good for selection and price. As for the rings hooking up to the battery, to do it right, crimp your 14ga to the ring and then melt some electrical solder into it and you won't have any sort of a problem with it, just heat it up with a soldering gun or iron and get some solder in there. I redid the stereo in  my boat last year and am looking at adding a better/more powerfull amp and another pair of speakers. It's nice to have some tunes while trolling or anchored near a beach."
584978,mistaredone,2011-05-19 17:35:00,913,"Thanks bigbuck, I'm building a box for the deck and speakers. I have a 15 breaker hope that will be enough.  From what I understand black is the ground and should be hooked to the negative. Yellow is the power line to positive, I'll attach breaker here. And rred also goes to positive. I think that's the ignition line"

584994,Muskieman,2011-05-19 18:25:00,2472,Red is the Main power with an in-line fuse Yellow is the Memory power also with an in-line fuse Black is ground.  I put an on/off toggle switch in-line on my Red wire .. Yellow stays on constantly so I don't lose my settings..... but remember to charge your battery regularly ... just the Yellow will drain a 27 series battery in a week.  Randy 
584995,mistaredone,2011-05-19 18:36:00,913,  Thank you
585009,Flappn,2011-05-19 20:22:00,245,Can you connect the yellow and red together to the same switch so when the switch is off no power is going to the radio? I understand I would lose the settings but I am not to worried about that.
585213,bubbles,2011-05-20 13:18:00,591, Yes
585244,ohhenrygsr,2011-05-20 16:00:00,947,I would look into a marine unit.  I've seen car decks maybe last a year.  They don't like the cold nights and moisture
585259,Fisherman,2011-05-20 18:25:00,7201,"Moisture yes, cold nights, hmmmmm, wonder why I've never had a radio thunder in at -40."
585263,irishfield,2011-05-20 18:42:00,26272,Play nice FM... cold nights equal dew on the water...
