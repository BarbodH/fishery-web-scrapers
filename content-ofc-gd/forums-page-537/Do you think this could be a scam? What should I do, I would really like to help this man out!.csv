585275,Big Cliff,2011-05-20 19:11:00,6899," Beans, you and I are probably the only two people I know that would practice all night for a urin test then fail it in the morning! LOL.  Anyway, I have had lots of fun with this guy, gave him my phone number, told him I needed help filling out the forms, He has called me twice now (kept him on the phone as long as I could) from country code 44 wherever that is LOL. It haas to be costing him something to make these long distance phone calls, the more the better I figure."
585299,irishfield,2011-05-20 20:46:00,26272,Sad part is 44 is the Isle of Man.. already a tax free haven! I guess it's like thieves outside a Casino..  ...it also includes GB and a large part of the UK..  it's bloomed a long way since it was just the nigerian government having an entire gymnasium full of workers with phone books and fax machines. I've been getting faxes from Nigeria since the machines came on line in the late '80s
585019,Big Cliff,2011-05-19 21:04:00,6899,"I just received this email today:  ""Hello  It gives me a great deal of pleasure to write you this mail even when it might come to you as a surprise. I hope you find it of interest.  My name is Johnson Blair. I am an Auditor with a Bank here in Europe . I would like to use this means to ask your assistance in moving some funds over to your country.  I have in the course of my duties come in contact with some funds that have been inactive for some years now and careful investigation proved the original depositor of the funds died over six years ago.  All attempts to reach the suppose beneficiary of the deposit were fruitless and before it is forfeited to the state, I will like to move it outside now and this is were I need your assistance.  According to laws of the land, all unattended deposit beyond seven years will be forfeited to the state, hence my contacting you.  I look forward to hearing from you and my gratitude for your patience  Sincerely yours,  Johnson Blair Tel: +447024024710 Fax: +447040906254"""
585021,lunkerbasshunter,2011-05-19 21:08:00,2585,oh yeah that is for real.....
585022,Big Cliff,2011-05-19 21:08:00,6899,"But wait, there is more, they want to give me a lot of money just for helping them out! I sent him an email asking what he needed me to do to help him. I got this back:  ""Thanks for your response to my mail, it was well appreciated.  Let me formally introduce myself. I am a private and independent Auditor  with Northern Rock Bank and other financial institutions.   In the course of our auditing, we have discovered an account that has not  been operational since 2004. After thorough investigation, we discovered  that the owner of the account, late Fran an Engineer, 65 years died in a  natural disaster 2004 in Indonesia, see http://www.tsunami2004.net . All  effort to locate any members of his family has proved abortive.   It was in this circumstance, that I have contacted you to partner with me  for the transfer of these funds to your Bank for our mutual benefit, as a  top official of the Northern Rock bank is also involved in this intended  transaction. Note that since he works with the bank and I a private auditor,  I was mandated to source for the credible partner to receive these funds on  our behalf. And such partner must share same last name with the deceased, to  enable us have a convincing claim on the funds, presenting the partner as a  next of Kin.  According to laws of the land, all unattended deposit beyond seven years  will be forfeited to the state, hence my contacting you, because the  deceased after my research with the Death and Birth Registry, has not next  of kin, neither did leave behind any ""Last Will and Testament"".   The total amount secured is Â£9,135,000.00 (Nine Million, One Hundred and  Thirty Five Thousand British Pounds), and we are willing to share with you  70% for us, 30% for you.   Further to the above, please find below the procedures and details required  for the realization of this transaction.   To ensure that everything is done legally, we shall employ the services of  Northern Rock Bank U.K accredited Lawyer that would represent the interest  of both parties.   The lawyer shall depose an affidavit with the High Court for the change of  beneficiary from late Fran to your name. This is to ensure legal transfer of  all documents to your name as the new benefactor and next of kin to the  deposited funds with Northern Rock Bank U.K.   The Court Affidavit would give you the legal status to receive the funds in  your account for us without being questioned by your Bank and your country's  financial authorities.   Upon transfer of beneficiary to your name, the attorney shall apply to  Northern Rock Bank U.K for necessary approvals from the Board of Directors  for the Fund Release Order and subsequent transfer of the funds to your Bank  account for us.    I would require your confirmation on the above aforementioned procedure to  enable me apply on your behalf for the Beneficiary's Claims Application Form  for your completion. Copy of the Form will be sent to you by E-mail  attachment for your completion.   You will be required to complete the Form and either Fax or email back to  the Wire Department for their routine processing and subsequent approvals to  authorize transfer of the funds to your account for us.   Feel free to seek further clarification and I will oblige you.   I wait your confirmation as I look forward to a fruitful business  relationship with you.  Regards,  Mr. Johnson Blair Managing Partner/ Executive Auditor Tel: +447024024710 Fax: +447040906254""  He sounds like such a nice person and you know me, I love to help people!"

585025,Big Cliff,2011-05-19 21:13:00,6899,"Ya but Terry, what if it is real? 3 million PDS would set me up for life! Are any of the rest of your family going to tale him up on this offer, if so perhaps I should cut my comission to 2 million!"
585026,splashhopper,2011-05-19 21:13:00,2931,if it came in your email... then it must be for you

585033,Big Cliff,2011-05-19 21:20:00,6899,"Oh no, do you think this might be a twist on the old My link  Oh, I am so devistated, to think all I wanted to do was help this poor man. Boy, I wish there was someone I could report this to that could/would do something about it! I almost sent him $10,000.00 to help with the transfer! I would have sent it but I'm about $9999.99 short of what is needed!"
585034,glen,2011-05-19 21:30:00,2641,I feel sorry for the people who fall for this stuff.  They prey on the weakest and that aint funny.

585051,kerr,2011-05-19 22:09:00,77,i got a similar letter in the mail from a barrister in South Africa a couple of weeks ago.

585071,BFSC Kevin,2011-05-19 23:11:00,1351,"too much reading in the email, so i'd ignore it."
585193,Jer,2011-05-20 11:08:00,1426,"You should reply that ""Fran"" actually is your uncle, thank him for informing you of his passing, and you'll be expecting the full inheritance shortly..."

585218,Billy Bob,2011-05-20 13:35:00,5865,"Something similar happened to a good friend of mine....I GOT a email from my friend Will saying he was stuck in England and had lost his wallet and needed cash wired to him ASAP from me...of course I knew this wasn't true so I called him at home and he answered the phone....but they broke the password he was using for his email service and then changed the password (a easy password) so he couldn't even use his own email while this was all going on...he was forced to start a new email account but this time with a much harder password...since then I have also changed my email password, making it MUCH more difficult to crack....you might want to do the same and save yourself LOTS of headaches that my buddy went through.  Bob"
585239,Beans,2011-05-20 14:58:00,3339," With our records Cliff, I don't think they would allow us across the border to retrieve the funds...  Sorry about the late reply...I crashed early seeing as how I got no sleep at all the night before during the sleep study test...  Does that mean I failed ???"
