584981,Billy Bob,2011-05-19 17:42:00,5865,I called this phone number 1-800-667-1940 to purchase a new Ontario License and one for the bride plus a Outdoor Card for her....the nice young girl on the phone was more then helpful and assured me that I would receive my license before I leave for Cliff's on June 24th...she even said they will go out in today's mail.... I know I should of ordered a couple weeks ago but I just kept forgetting.....and I guess they plan on allowing non-residents to purchase a license online soon...  I did ask what do I do just in case I don't receive my license before we leave...she said just call back and they can fax one to me....NICE...I'm impressed.  Bob

584990,Pikeslayer,2011-05-19 18:11:00,1443,"Hey Bob, you might want to check with Cliff. I'm pretty sure that Zone 17 regs have been changed this year for 'Residents Only'. Pretty sure it is now permanently closed to non-residents.  Slayer"
584998,Harrison,2011-05-19 18:56:00,2202," Man oh man, the Zone 17 regs are so confusing now.  I think if you look real close at the reg 17(a)(d)-(r2d2) it refers strictly to those who are a non-resident or resident staying at a certain location near Snug Harbour only. These regs are so vague."
584999,Rattletrap2,2011-05-19 18:58:00,1652,"Bob, That is how good neighbours should be treated! Did she also mention that you have to leave yer ""TNT Red Wigglers"" at home?  Glad things went smoothly for you!"
585070,Billy Bob,2011-05-19 23:07:00,5865, What the hell..Pikeslayer....Residents only....AGAIN...this keeps happening to me....but I'm prepared like a good Redneck....I'll just have to go Commando AGAIN....got to get the light cammo gear ready for next month..but remember...NO ASSAULT Weapons of any kind this time  (don't ask)....kind of keeps me defenseless when the Canadian Air Force does a full force attack on me come dusk....they are unbeatable !  !  !...what on earth do they feed on when I'm not there ? ? ?
585074,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2011-05-19 23:28:00,0,"when you're not hear they feed on the ""good stuff""..."
585076,Billy Bob,2011-05-19 23:33:00,5865," Well then, you must be enough to keep them happy..."
