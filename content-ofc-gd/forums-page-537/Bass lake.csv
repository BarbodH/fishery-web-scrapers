583902,livinisfishin,2011-05-17 01:18:00,661,Just wondering if there is any guys that fish this lake regularily throughout different times of the year? Wouldn't mind asking a couple questions.
583910,irishfield,2011-05-17 01:21:00,26272,"Which one, of the 200, in Ontario?? Orillia.. Rideau Ferry.. ??"
583922,livinisfishin,2011-05-17 01:32:00,661,Lol orillia
583923,irishfield,2011-05-17 01:34:00,26272,"Haven't fished that one... but I believe there is a good post in the archives somewhere on it, about the campground and the works. Just damn hard to do a search on ""bass"" or ""lake"" !! lol"
583933,Homer Is King,2011-05-17 01:42:00,305,We stayed at Bass Lake Provincial Park a couple of years ago. I fished it for a weekend. Mostly with the kids for panfish. The sunfish seem plentiful! We kept a couple for a fish fry but they were FULL of worms. The worst I have seen. Black dots on the skin and the meat was full of yellow grubs.  We did get a couple of smallies. They were released but skin was covered with black dots as well.  If may have been bad luck / bad time of year with all the worms? I don't know?
583940,livinisfishin,2011-05-17 01:52:00,661,Any ideas how deep it can get in there?
583942,livinisfishin,2011-05-17 01:55:00,661,I would love to do a search but for some reason I have never been able to do it when using my blackberry. I would probably hit every single thread on here with those two words . 
583955,coreyhkh,2011-05-17 02:30:00,163,Hey I fished this lake a few years back its max depth is only around 10-14 feet but average depth is only 5 to 6. I didn't have much luck mostly sunfish and small bass.
584061,manitoubass2,2011-05-17 13:41:00,11391,"lol, I got all excited thinking an OFC member was going to be fishing near me, in Bass Lake Nestor Falls  oh wel l:tease:"
584067,motion,2011-05-17 13:53:00,403,We used to camp/fish there often. Nice park for camping with good bass fishing in the summer months. Can't leave you boat docked overnight (well there are only 2 temporary docks)There is a boat rental as well. Not much to do this time of year though.
584069,Governator,2011-05-17 13:56:00,879,"I caught perch there 2 years ago and every one was filled with black dots, they were disgusting to look at.  Never fished it since, probably never will again."
584106,redskullz,2011-05-17 15:04:00,55,"Alot of the shallow lakes in that area the fish are full of white and black worms.....now i have heard that there is some decent crappie in bass lake, but i havent tried fishing it personally."
584161,ciceri,2011-05-17 17:01:00,535,All I caught out of there the one time was some pretty big sunfish.
584201,Lunatic,2011-05-17 19:32:00,536,"i was looking into that place for camping this year,decided to try elsewhere 1.because my other option seemed better for us and 2. i read a few terrible reviews on the place and one of the reviews painted the staff there like nazi's lol"
584385,Kerry,2011-05-18 03:04:00,383,"Bass lake has a good population of large and smallmouth bass.Largemouth like the weedbeds and wood throughout the lake.Smallies like the open areas with mixed rock and light weed growth and are more apt to be in water 3-8 ft.It has big sunfish and there are crappie and perch.bass lake is a bowl type lake.It has a deep hole about 34ft which i believe is a spring.The main center portion of the lake is 20ft but the best fishing is probably in the 8-12 ft depth during the day as largemouths love hanging around the cabbage beds crossing the lake between the 13th and 14th lines.Late evening and in the dark fishing lily pads at the south end(woods)can be lots of fun for big largemouth.Further out in the flats from there smallies will roam in the 4-5 ft depth during the day. Our #1 bait for bass lake has got to be the rattlin rap or cordell spot black/gold.Easy fishing just chuck and wind. It is the perfect lake if you have kids cause there are sunfish practically everywhere and they like to bite. I have friends that go there every bass opener and they always have a fish fry for the weekend with a good mix of all species.  The park is great,most sites are good.Always a good idea to take a cruise thru if you aren't booking a site so you can pick what you like.The sites right by the water do not have power and there only 4 sites I think and a couple get pretty muddy if its wet.The park has a store but just ice cream treats,chocolates and such.It only has canoe and paddleboat rentals now too.Hope this helps.

584399,redskullz,2011-05-18 04:16:00,55,34 feet deep! wow thats suprising as all i had heard was the 13-14' that corey talked about...maybe i got it confused with another lake.
584544,spinnerbaitking,2011-05-18 17:12:00,1622,"I have a Lake Map that was picked up at the office maybe 10 years ago, across the lake from the park it's over 30', there is lots of cover for the lmbass & I've had really good fishing on the north shore for smallies you just have to put your time in to figure out what's working, very friendly cottagers only ran into 1 idiot all the times I was there, the Ontario Junior Bass Team used the lake for a Qualifier, my son & a buddies son made the team a few years, i need to go back there & don't rule out Spinnerbaits SBK"
584613,bassfighter,2011-05-18 20:52:00,366,"It was good till 5 years ago, before the housing development in the area, The city also accomodated a walmart and a mall .  Tough fishing conditions on that lake."
584715,FISHINGNUT,2011-05-19 00:47:00,253,I fished the lake last  year for the first time and stayed at the park in mid August for a week.There is alot of pan fish and some bass .I fished that lake hard and did manage a few bass but not many compared to the hours spent on the water. The park is ok but as another post mentioned no where for your boat over night.Its a good day trip lake if your in the area.But there are many more nicer and better fishing places and parks around IMO
