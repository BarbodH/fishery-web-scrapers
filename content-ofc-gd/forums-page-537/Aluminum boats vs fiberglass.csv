585032,zeeter,2011-05-19 21:20:00,92,"Own a 167 Princecraft Pro Series and it's a great boat.  Lots of room, very stable and excellent storage.  Before this boat I owned a 142 Princecraft and it was also a great boat.  I just wanted a larger boat with more power.  If you keep your eyes open you can get a really good deal.  My 167 is a 1997 with a barely used 70 HP and I got it for $6000 !!!!"
585172,2advanced,2011-05-20 04:07:00,53,If we are talking about welded over riveted for aluminum boats its a no brainer.  After selling our prince craft we picked up a crestliner aluminum welded boat. I pound this boat and not one leak.  I still agree with the people that day fiberglass boats offer the best ride comfort hands down.
584758,Fish Farmer,2011-05-19 02:13:00,2234,I've have 2 and I wouldn't buy another.
584768,Roy,2011-05-19 02:23:00,13728,My Princecraft is very stable and does not leak a drop. Rivets are all tight.
584774,fish_fishburn,2011-05-19 02:31:00,1311,I had a 17 footer in the late 80's and the hull split in two places towards the bow. They looked at it and said they would not cover it under their warranty even though the boat was only two years old.  They told me to put it through my insurance because it would cost 8 grand to fix. So I did and my insurance company wrote it off.  I sent a letter to the president of the company at the time and told him I would give them all the free negative advertising they ever wanted and to this day I still do. Maybe things have changed but I have never forgotten how they looked after me. I highly recommend you buy another brand.
584780,Roy,2011-05-19 02:40:00,13728,Which brand do you have now fishburn?
584781,mercman,2011-05-19 02:41:00,7054,"  I'm with you on this one Roy.Its like any brand, you may get a lemon, but that is not the norm.I've been around Princecrafts  for many many years and never seen one leak that was taken care of."
584783,Roy,2011-05-19 02:44:00,13728, I think you statement needs an edit.
584786,archie_james_c,2011-05-19 02:46:00,618,"I have a 16 foot Holiday. Its a nice, wide stable boat, but it cuts waves like a piece of plywood and catches wind like a kite. Two disadvantages that REALLY kill a Walleye fisherman. My next boat will be a used Ranger 18 foot tiller or an Alumacraft, something built to handle choppy water and higher winds."

584800,Nipfisher,2011-05-19 03:31:00,2449,Hubba Bubba or Bubblicious?  The other day I was chewing some hubba bubba and I got to thinking. It got stale pretty fast and stuck to my teeth. Then I remembered bubblicious. Wow what a great gum. I love the way the flavor stayed and it was great for blowing bubbles.  I like aluminum. I had a fibreglass bow-rider and now have a STARCRAFT fishing boat. I love it.
584802,HTHM,2011-05-19 03:35:00,4082,True dat!  That is hilarious!
584814,discophish,2011-05-19 04:26:00,392,"My Princecraft almost flipped over and sank to the bottom of the lake!  Oh wait a sec ... that was the time when the drift bag deployed in the water at almost full throttle while fastened to the front tow hook ... never mind.  Oh yeah, btw ... the drift sock thing.  Know where it is!  ... seriously  <sigh>"
584819,Tybo,2011-05-19 05:12:00,1373,"If I was a fair weather fisherman and fished areas I knew.I might go glass, For their is no rivets,But I know prefer a dent over a crack or puncture.  Plus My PRO-V is one of the greatest riding boats I've been in."
584824,fish_fishburn,2011-05-19 08:50:00,1311,"I have a Nitro Savage bass boat now Roy. I bought it new in 1996. It has been a great boat for me and has never given me any problems what so ever. Its powered by a 175 EFI merc and its still running strong. I spent a year working up in the Kenora, Dryden area back in the late 80's and the majority of the boats used up there then were Lund or Misty River. Thats what I wanted to buy originally but there were no dealers for either here in the valley so I settled for a Princecraft instead. That was a big mistake."
584839,mercman,2011-05-19 11:03:00,7054,Hey GB...The link doesnt work.............               
584843,Fish Farmer,2011-05-19 11:44:00,2234,"Aluminum boats have there place. There alright for the 1 day a week calm water trips, Give them the Great lakes test 5,6,7 days a week, 8, 10 hour days, then tell me if you don't have leaks. If I had to do it over again, I would go with Harborcraft or Stanley, cost more, but are life time boats. Just ask yourself if you see big cruiser boats in aluminum. Most charter boats that fish the great lakes are glass. I had the head guy from Princecraft look at my boat and he told me my problem was wave action. I was in a company in Bradford that repaired aluminum boats, he had every make there getting fixed. A buddy of mine only had his boat 2 years and the bow folded up from waves on Lake O. If it gets rough, trolling speed only back to port."
584844,mercman,2011-05-19 11:58:00,7054,"100% in agreement. You have to choose a boat that fits your needs.Its like using a lite pick up for heavy construction work.The lite truck will fall apart.If fishing the inland seas, you need a heavy duty ""Truck"""
584850,12footspringbok,2011-05-19 12:08:00,459,"Smashing any boat through any sized waves likely isn't going to do your hull favours in the long run. Surprised the old man hasn't chimed in here, but hes had his 16' princecraft for 15 years now and its spent most of its life rigging on georgian bay in sometimes less than calm conditions and i still don't think it leaks a drop... He also keeps the speed down when it gets bumpy out there unless I'm in the front seat egging him on....   LOL"
584853,archie_james_c,2011-05-19 12:11:00,618,"  Agreed, we're not fishing an FLW Lake Erie walleye tourny in a 22 foot Ranger, no need to be zipping along at 25mph in 2-3 footers. Slow down!"

I fish lake O from  june-sept every chance I get.  My buddy that I fish with alot has an '04 princecraft that leaks.  Princecraft is a decent boat, but not my first choice.  S."
584873,schooner dave,2011-05-19 13:06:00,8,"I agree with what is being said here concerning driving to suit weatherr conditions, however I disagree with what I erxpect out of an expensive boat. Princecrafts are not to be found in the bargain basement a new boat similar to mine is going to cost in the 30K plus range. For this kind of money I expect to be able to be on any mid size inland lake in a 1 foot chop and be able to ride along without being jostled and thrown all over. The boat is deep and is cvonstructed with the much advertised ""double chine"". I'm not a speed fanatic and drive according to lake conditions etc.  I have not been impressed with Princecrafts customer service. For my money I will not be buying another princecraft based on my current experience.      "
584887,DRIFTER_016,2011-05-19 14:03:00,10439,"  Out on the West coast you will find an abundance of aluminum boats. And HarberCraft/KingFisheris the right up there, though there are lots of other aluminum offshore boats and skiffs to be seen. Wooldrige is another big West coast name."
584980,aplumma,2011-05-19 17:42:00,6896,"I run a 28ft x 11ft Aluminum boat made by Marinette with twin 318 and 480 HP. I have run it hard in bad water when needed with no ill effects. Mind you it is all welded 1/4"" plate aluminum with a strong structural design. Different boats are needed for different conditions their is no right or wrong answer on what boat is better until you define the area it is used in.    Art"
585002,craigdritchie,2011-05-19 19:58:00,1586,"Perhaps, but I still see a lot of Starcraft Islanders out on the lakes.  Harbercraft makes a very nice alumium boat that is widely used on the west coast for fishing charters. Same for Weldcraft - I recently test-drove a couple of their Cuddy King models, and they're very nice boats. I just posted a boat test I did on a 24-foot Weldcraft on my blog, for what it's worth. I drove a 24-footer and a 28. Both were awesome, even when we headed out into the open ocean and 15-foot swells."
583640,ricdorais,2011-05-16 15:04:00,3,A work colleague has just bought a boat. It is a 20-foot Princecraft aluminum boat. I’ve been fiberglass boat owner for several years and it was thefirst time I tried a boat ofthis type. Very surprised! You can feel that theboat is very light but it is also very stable in the waves ... He told me they have a doublereverse chine hull design that keep theboat stable and helps to have a better control. Princecraft even have deck boats that are very beautiful and it’s hard to see the difference with a fiberglass boat ... I think I'll really consider this brand (www.princecraft.com) for my next purchase! What do you think of Princecraft boats?  
583642,Roy,2011-05-16 15:09:00,13728,"Welcome aboard. I have a Princecraft, smaller of course but very stable. There are many good brands out there and Princecraft is one of them."
583664,cwpowell,2011-05-16 16:14:00,265,"I think ol' Mercman just bought a princecraft. As far as I can see, which is not very far without my glasses, especially on a dark, wet day, he loves it."
583667,grt1,2011-05-16 16:23:00,638,my American neighbour has a princecraft and it seems very capable of handling the rough water and he just loves it.
583670,Terry,2011-05-16 16:24:00,14456,I think princecraft is one if not the only aluminum boat company in Canada that makes the whole boat in Canada hull and all..  lots of quality boats out there and princecraft is amongst them

One day I ran across Lake O in a 20ft princecraft and just got soaked, I blamed it on driver error but he swore it was the boat.  Then again, I dont think it had the ""doublereverse chine hull design - reg. TM"" though as it was a couple years ago.  Ran a 2050 Lund and never got close to saoked as I did then.  I would much rather run a glass boat in big water.  Hands down, no question about it.  Ran a 20ft aluminum and a 20ft glass on alot of big water and the glass way out handled the tinny."

I found some pictures on the Facebook fan page of Princecraft!!

584570,Mike01,2011-05-18 18:37:00,378,I will never buy another aluminium boat of anything bigger than backwoods lakes.  I have had far to many problems with leaking rivets.

584598,schooner dave,2011-05-18 20:22:00,8,In the fall of 09 I bought a 2000 Princecraft - 176 Fish n Promenade model. The boat looked like new....but in anything over 1 ft of waves the boat rides like pure crap....if your fillings are loose you'll lose them! I was and still am very surprised and disappointed in this aspect. After everything I had heard about Princecraft being a quality boat it was a big disappointment to me. In addition to the poor ride I have found that all of the plywood behind the foam padding in the bow of the boat has rotted and basically disenergrated. I am in the process of reconstructing same.In addition the floor appears a little spongy and will most likely need to be replaced in the next couple of years.

584600,irishfield,2011-05-18 20:31:00,26272,Wood in a Princecraft of that year should be guaranteed for life... Lunds are. Should be a dealer/factory $$ problem. Major inconvience for you though.

584755,OhioFisherman,2011-05-19 02:04:00,6623,"I have been on wood boats, steel boat, aluminum boats and fiberglass boats, some have a reputation as a good riding boat, some merely fair.  Dad had two wooden Lyman`s, a much better ride than his same size Sandusky wood boat. Different hull designs and the Lyman`s were a heavier boat even though the size and motor was the same.  Most of the tri hull glass boats I have been on were great in calm water, they would beat you up in rough water at the same speed.  My 25 foot Searay rode better than a 25 foot Bayliner, just a better hull design and heavier construction.  All the bass boats I have been on rode well, but taking one out in the Great Lakes in 4 to 6 footers usually isn`t a good plan.  Buy a boat that suits your intented uses.  Had a 17 foot Smokercraft for 20 years, aluminum and never a leak, and it rode well in decent waters, 3-5 foot waves weren`t what it was made for."
