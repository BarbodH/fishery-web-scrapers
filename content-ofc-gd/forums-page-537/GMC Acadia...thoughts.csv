My wife has decided that she wants to buy one in the next few days. I have searched on line but would also like to hear from someone who owns one ,knows someone who does or maybe even a GM tech. Thanks for any feedback."
584655,scugpg,2011-05-18 22:57:00,1373,I've been test driving lots of vehicles lately and if I were you I would strongly consider the ford edge in that price range. The 2011 has a really nice interior and power train. I'm not impressed with gm dealers or extended warranty pricing it's crazy...and I've always been a gm guy. if you do like the edge and don't mind diving to london area I can put you in touch with a great dealership.  Also ford seems to be more accurate with their fuel mileage ratings.
584660,Skud,2011-05-18 22:59:00,739,Just bought one for my wife a month ago. 2008 AWD with 92K on it for $22K. Base model. They can come with a lot of toys that pushes up the price. I think they are great and they rate well with consumer reports. Drives much nicer and handles better than the the Expedition we had.
584700,mattp33,2011-05-19 00:22:00,290,"Great vehicle, just sold 1 to a customer and they are thrilled with it!  PM me if you want some info from someone in the business.  I can also get you a great deal on just about any make or model."
584738,bow slayer,2011-05-19 01:32:00,1074," Actually I am in the london area(St.Thomas) The Edge is a little small but the wife does like the Flex though. She has it narrowed down to a Pathfinder,Flex,and the Acadia. She likes the GMC the most."
584740,bow slayer,2011-05-19 01:36:00,1074,"The one she has been eyeing has all the toys also a 2008 power roof,leather,quads,and dvd. The price is around 22 and change."
584886,mattp33,2011-05-19 14:03:00,290,$22 000 for an 08 with leather and dvd?  Thats a great price!  Market value is around 28-29 for those right now depending on km's too
584946,bow slayer,2011-05-19 16:48:00,1074,"Sorry it is a 2007 with 90 k. All the toys including leather dvd,roof.  22,455."
584952,Skud,2011-05-19 16:59:00,739,Still a good price
584967,Flappn,2011-05-19 17:21:00,245,My in-laws have had one for a year and they love it. No issues to date...and I gotta say the it's pretty nice in and out.
584984,Harrison,2011-05-19 17:57:00,2202,"They are nice rides.  My bud has one, got a scratch duck hunting last year.  I haven't seen him, he's probably still grounded.  sorry to hi-jack..  Mattp33, find me a solid 02 -03 yukon/tahoe with 120 or so Km if possible."
585001,cram,2011-05-19 19:22:00,1733,"Some of the early ones had issues with (a lot of) water leaking in through the roof.  If buying used you may want to check on this to ensure you don't get a leaker.  Or, wear your yellow slicker and rain boots."
585007,craigdritchie,2011-05-19 20:17:00,1586,"The Acadia has a pretty good recall history, all things considered. There are a few things listed in Transport Canada's database, but nothing really significant."
