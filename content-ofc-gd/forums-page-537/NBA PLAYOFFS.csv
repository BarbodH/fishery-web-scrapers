583510,laszlo,2011-05-16 08:00:00,487,Any predictions for the Conference Finals?  Chicago killed Miami last night! I'm hoping for a Chicago / OKC final but this may be the year for Dirk to win it all.  I just don't want Miami to win it the first year they put this team together.
583520,scugpg,2011-05-16 10:19:00,1373,I hope the heat pull through but if not I'll root for the mavs. I like rose though he is a great player this should be a great series. Bulls have awesome defense they will be tough to beat.
583522,Musky or Specks,2011-05-16 11:05:00,2710,I think its Dirk's year but I love the match ups this year. No Lakers!! No Celtics!!!
583530,Grimace,2011-05-16 11:36:00,2020,Dallas over Chicago in 7
584599,laszlo,2011-05-18 20:24:00,487,HOLY DIRK!!!

584614,aplumma,2011-05-18 20:53:00,6896,It's got to be something to do about fishing on a fishing forum right?   Art
584663,Rizzo,2011-05-18 23:10:00,4754,don't really care as long as its not the Heat. Know more about the Bulls because we see them more often plus they have that goofy salami and cheese guy over there. Whoever wins the East will take it (you don't hear that too often!)
584665,Rizzo,2011-05-18 23:12:00,4754,...and in other news the raptors drop to 5th over-all pick...can nothing go right for these guys? I hear Cleveland has 1st and 4th picks after one year of being lousy...must be nice (other than you have to live in Cleveland)
584671,Rod Caster,2011-05-18 23:26:00,5784,I think the National Bass Association will have a great season.
584813,Victor,2011-05-19 04:25:00,1609,"I really like derrick rose as well. Humble and works hard, and of course lighting quick. I hope that they can win against Miami but I think the series is 50/50.  Doubt that OKC can find anyone to guard Dirk. He's just keep stroking it or make his points at the FT line."
