584406,young_one,2011-05-18 08:09:00,620,"After finishing my exams and fishing the Trout Opener, I went for a 18 day trip with my parents, visiting relative and sightseeing. With only 18 days, our schedule was tight and packed with unique experiences!  Throughout the whole trip: - 4 flights totaling almost 30 hrs - High speed bullet train (@400km/h) - 6 different cities - 1 massive wedding with over 200+ guests - Every meal was a feast! My belt actually popped loose on its own - 2 fishing occasions  Enjoy the pictures!  Leaving Pearson for the 12.5 hr flight. Toronto -> Beijing   First meal of the trip, the beginning of many to come!   The apartment we have in Beijing, we are the second floor with the AC radiator.   As a result of the 2008 Summer Olympic, the city had many new 5-star plus hotels. Including this one that wrapped around our neighborhood!     The ancient structures remain, while many residential areas were moved to the outskirt.   Fancy dining atmosphere at a top-end restaurant   First fishing trip in Shanghai with my father and my uncle. Driving range combine with fishing farm.   Different mix of dough as bait   Pole fishing   Slightly more complex and advance pole fishing techniques   2 of many caught on this trip, the red spots are most likely some sort of infection due to high concentration of farmed fish. Probably not harmful.   High speed (bullet) train, much better and more efficient than our GO Train! City @~200km/h. Countryside @<400km/h   2nd or 3rd generation of Tibetan Mastiff, the ultimate guard dog, they only go for the neck!    My 2nd fishing trip in a different province, the temperature reached 38*C around noon!    Typical fishing/countryside-experience resort     The result/massacre!   Surprisingly very tasty    Halal BBQ, different items ranging from ￥1~￥6RMB. Approximately $0.15CAD  Few of many I had   THE Peking Duck, this restaurant started the dish!   Fish fillet, sweet and sour fish to the next level!   Chicken feet for the road, anyone?   An assortment of alcohol at a highway service station   If you ever get the chance to visit China, it will be the trip of a lifetime! Land of history, place of legend!"

584412,solopaddler,2011-05-18 08:55:00,8605,An interesting trip for sure.  What species were the fish you caught in the 2nd outing?
584414,young_one,2011-05-18 09:10:00,620,"Mostly Grass Carp in the middle, a flat carp on the bottom, same specie as my first trip. The giant one on the right is another specie of carp."
584416,solopaddler,2011-05-18 09:15:00,8605,  What did they taste like and how were they cooked? Just curious.
584423,danbouck,2011-05-18 10:43:00,4380,Great pics!
584459,corvette1,2011-05-18 12:56:00,1765,that was one awesome trip
584478,Homer Is King,2011-05-18 14:10:00,305,Great report!  Thanks for sharing.
584487,Fish4Eyes,2011-05-18 14:21:00,1022,"Cool pics, thanks for sharing. What was it like to ride in the train at 400km/h? Does it feel like your moving that fast?"
584488,Victor,2011-05-18 14:22:00,1609,Welcome back bud! Did you pick up any tackle while you were there? I bought 2 whips + whip holder and some floats when I went to Taiwan last year. Those are probably impossible to find around here.  How did you like the carp fishing? We gotta go for some Lake O carp haha.   Carp is actually considered as delicacy at some parts of China/Taiwan/Europe. I was told that there are restaurants in Taiwan that just specializes in serving carp. There are tons of ways to cook it. The more common methods are streaming/stew I believe. Not really a big fan of it myself
584498,GBW,2011-05-18 15:02:00,8460,nice report and pic's y_o
584500,wolfville,2011-05-18 15:06:00,396,"Nice pics, I'm sure it's a lot of fun.  Victor, you didn't like it because you didn't go to the right place ordering the right food ;-)"
584501,frozen-fire,2011-05-18 15:07:00,542,Great write-up of your trip! That sweet and sour carp dish looks so tasty!
584534,Mike Pike,2011-05-18 16:47:00,1332,What an amazing trip and lots of great photos to remember it by!  So different culturally than our life here.  Thanks for sharing!  Now I'm gonna go back to look at the pics again...
584564,kickingfrog,2011-05-18 18:06:00,8333,"That does not look like any airline food I've had before... and I've been on a 10plus hour flight.  Before I read that it was a driving range I was wondering if the netting was there to prevent people from casting.  Definitely an incredible part of the world to visit,  as long as I had someone in the know for a guide (not so subtle hint)."
584568,Jds63,2011-05-18 18:25:00,1365,"wow, nice trip ... thanks for sharing your photos"

584618,Rattletrap2,2011-05-18 21:23:00,1652,"Great report and trip! Looks very interesting, but not someplace I would want to visit without a knowledgeable guide!"
584622,bigbuck,2011-05-18 21:32:00,2449,Great report from you trip to the other side of the Earth. China is definitely on my list of places to get to at some point in my life.
584720,kerr,2011-05-19 01:02:00,77,"awesome report dude, id love to be able to snag a few then work on my swing. China knows how to do fins and skins and do it up right i see."
