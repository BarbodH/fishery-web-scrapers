551688,Nipfisher,2011-02-15 03:31:00,2449,Being Father's Day weekend it is tough for me with young boys to get away for the weekend. I'm only an hour away so I'll try and make it up there for the Friday night. I'll call Kevin about a tent site.
551691,SBCregal,2011-02-15 03:39:00,688,"we'd love to make it up there for the g2g this year, but we're getting married that weekend.  we'll definitely be planning a trip up there sometime this summer   ryan"
565602,ChrisK,2011-03-24 20:34:00,2772,Been awhile

565692,skeeter,2011-03-25 02:14:00,1907,"Mercman, after all the salt you have been rubbing into my wounds the last 2 days, I have cut the roof off the tent you and Barb will be in."
565696,mercman,2011-03-25 02:22:00,7054,Thats good news Skeets. Now i have to find out who will be in the lots next to ours. My is registered as a lethal weapon and i am obliged by law to inform people.
565880,John,2011-03-25 15:52:00,2956, No prob to set things up on the dock Ryan. Could probably fit the service in between the pike derby and the awards...  A moonlight cruise through the narrows can be very romantic while swatting the mosquitos.....
565884,NAW,2011-03-25 16:13:00,4022, Let me know what he says about the tent sites.  I'd like to come up for a day.  Can't stay the entire weekend though..
565894,Rich Clemens,2011-03-25 16:52:00,3131,That would be great to fill the place up that week-end.   Lots of new folks to finally meet.

534195,ChrisK,2011-01-03 15:09:00,2772,"Ok boys and girls after many hours of deliberation with the mod group we have come up with the dates of June18th/19th for our Lakair G2G.Muskie,pike and walleye seasons will be open so we'll have lots of stuff to do.

534218,Rich Clemens,2011-01-03 16:03:00,3131,What took you so long  ?    I already made my reservations a few weeks ago.   Pulling in Friday the 17th and staying the entire next week.   We'll be in Cabin 8 this year.  My son-in-law wants to come along for his first-ever Canadian Fishing adventure.  Is there any better way to initiate someone than an OFC GTG  (Don't answer that    )
534221,ChrisK,2011-01-03 16:06:00,2772,"Heres another reason why I'm exited about this G2G  I get to keep this trophy for yet another year unless one of my fellow OFC'ers are good enough,sorry,lucky enough to take it from me "
534225,skeeter,2011-01-03 16:12:00,1907,Miss Kelly and I will be there again!!!!
534226,BITEME,2011-01-03 16:17:00,1968,   Oh yeah you are going to lose that for sure
534231,Rich Clemens,2011-01-03 16:37:00,3131,  One of these years ... that trophy is heading SOUTH of the border.
534235,danbouck,2011-01-03 16:43:00,4380,Set on my calendar.  Probably arrive Friday and leave Monday if we can find a babysitter
534238,ChrisK,2011-01-03 16:55:00,2772,I think you lost that horseshoe at Lakair couple years ago and I think I found it. Makes it kind of hard to walk though
534242,ChrisK,2011-01-03 17:01:00,2772,"Rich, It would be my pleasure to hand it off to you or one of our other southern OFC'ers but action speaks louder than words bubba"
534371,bigugli,2011-01-03 22:55:00,6138,I'm really hoping to make it this time.

534775,Jewelbee,2011-01-05 00:30:00,422,Would love to see you all again...up in the air for now tho.
534834,Familyfisherman,2011-01-05 03:04:00,188,"Went to the website, the place looks quite reasonable. What's the fishing like?  I've never fished Nippissing, but it isn't very far away.  I'd be interested in some feedback -- always looking for a good place to go.  Just curious. Thanks"
534841,ChrisK,2011-01-05 03:15:00,2772,Check out the photo gallery on the Lakair site. That pretty much sums it up.
534881,John,2011-01-05 12:49:00,2956,"If you happen to talk to Kevin or Leslie Chris, please tell them they owe me an answer on a cottage...."
