Fished for an hour and she outfished me 5-1 now i have to listen to that. Kept a couple that were deeply hooked for a snack!! Bass are fantastic this time of year, better than pickerel as far as I'm concerned.. till they get wormy anyway!!  AND.. Bell has installed hispeed all the way to Hearst now, so we now have hi-speed access at camp.. one bar, but it works!!         "

585082,Joey,2011-05-19 23:58:00,9122,"Dammit because your in a little slice of heaven, with hi-speed and a fish meal and you're upset the wife outfished you.  Priorities TJ, priorities  Looks great up there, can't believe there are no blackflies yet.  Keep those pics coming bud"

585106,Handlebarz,2011-05-20 00:59:00,3790,Your living the good life BOSS.  Dad loved the idea when we were up there that Bass was open all year.  Hope you guys have a great weekend and it stays cool enough to keep them black flies away.
585107,TJQ,2011-05-20 01:01:00,7806,Its not poaching if you eat them raw.
585110,curlrap,2011-05-20 01:06:00,58,  Did Tookie show you how to follow the rules of the outdoors. If so your in big trouble!!
