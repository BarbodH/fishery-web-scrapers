585234,johnnyb,2011-05-20 14:47:00,3413,Not sure I've heard or read too many reports on OFC over the years that name those 2 lakes....however you really can't go wrong for eyes and pike in the Chapleau region.  I think there are a few lodges on Anjigaming....maybe their websites will provide a bit of info?  
585292,Dara,2011-05-20 20:12:00,3052,You mean Camp Anjigami?
