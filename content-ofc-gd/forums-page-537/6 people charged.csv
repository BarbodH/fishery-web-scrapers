584932,Nipfisher,2011-05-19 16:29:00,2449,"<br clear=""all""> MNR News Release  ********************  Six residents from the Temiskaming Shores area have been fined a total of $2,100 for having too many walleye and sauger on Lake Abitibi and for lying to conservation officers.  Lawrence J. Belanger, Jeffrey M. Belanger, Wayne J. Belanger, Scott W. Belanger, and Stanley C. MacKewn of New Liskeard and Lori-Ann Roy of North Cobalt pleaded guilty and were fined $150 each for possessing an over-quota of walleye and sauger and $200 each for making false or misleading statements to conservation officers.  The court heard that on March 20, 2011, all six were ice-fishing on Lake Abitibi, east of Cochrane. Conservation officers watched the group catch and keep a number of walleye and sauger. The group was seen cleaning and cooking 20 of the fish. When the officers checked the group, they were found to be in possession of 15 walleye in addition to the fish they had eaten. Under their licences, the group could possess four walleye and/or sauger each for a total of 24 fish. Including fish that were consumed, the group had possessed 11 fish over their limit. When questioned by the officers, each member of the group denied having eaten any fish.  Justice of the Peace Dolores Boyuk heard the case in the Ontario Court of Justice, Cochrane, on May 12, 2011.  The public is reminded that any fish eaten while fishing must be included in the possession limit and that it is an offence to deliberately mislead conservation officers.

584936,jedimaster,2011-05-19 16:33:00,3472,I always thought over posesion charges were for each fish?
584941,kenzy31,2011-05-19 16:40:00,261,waaaayyy too light on the over-limit fines.  should be 4 or 5 times that. I don't understand the deterence to overfish when the fine for it is lower than for lying....  better to admit it and pay less????  that doesn't get us any further ahead in protecting our resources!
