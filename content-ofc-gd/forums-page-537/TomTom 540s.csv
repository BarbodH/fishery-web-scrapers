I am not too familiar wiht GPS's; another customer there recommmended Garmin's instead.  By the way, the flyer showed the unit on sale for $139 but the Leslie/Sheppard store had them listed at 119.  Their computer showed that they had 13 in stock but they couldn't find them.  I did get a rain cheque."

As for the ""tracking"" that they have been all over the news for, don't let that bother you.  I do not know of anyone that has been contacted because of it.  I know a lot of people that have Tom Tom and speed, non of them have had problems.  To be honest I would imagine all of the companies do it, just Tom Tom was called out on it?  If you think it is a good deal then get it.  Everyone is going to have different opinions on what is better.  Kind of like the good ol tiller/console debate."
