177076,FISHINGNUT,2008-03-26 23:01:00,253,I have a 24 volt minkota bow mount on my boat .Its around 6-7 years old.Last year I replaced the foot pedal it wasnt working .I noticed last year that it doesnt steer as fast as at used too.Steering to the right is faster than to the left.Nothing is catching or pinching the shaft so I dont get it .Is there brushes or something I can replace or some type of service that can be done to it . Thanks Jamie

177154,Garry2Rs,2008-03-27 00:10:00,1425,I assume these are electric steer...I switched to cable steering with my first bass boat and would never go back.
177156,Gerritt,2008-03-27 00:11:00,6129,I am assuming you guys are talking about when it is under power...??  if so my bet is the torque the blades are placing on the shaft as will naturally want to turn in the direction the prop is spinning.   G

When my older unit would turn one way and not the other, this is what I did and it fixed it just light new.You can also grease the shaft in certain spots and that also helps."

177690,FISHINGNUT,2008-03-28 00:26:00,253,Thank you for the replies guys.I wanted to make sure if I had to take it in to get serviced that I got it in early before the rush.I guess I could buy a new one this one has done me very well over the years .I am still hoping for a new boat that comes with a  trolling motor  but the wife wants a new car so I have to wait another year

177736,Rattletrap2,2008-03-28 01:31:00,1652,"The Power drive foot pedals are notorious for failing like this. I love Minn Kota motors, but will never buy this particular type again. They have small micro switches in the foot pedal that arc and burn out. The resistance through the switches causes the slow turning of the servo motors. The cable drive is the only way to go in my opinion. I would never switch back now. I once thought they would be a pain, but in fact they are a dream!  For service, try Rockey's in Orillia or Aikman's in Mississauga. they are both good shops."
177833,Victor,2008-03-28 05:29:00,1609,the trolling motor is like a fraction of a car's price tag  ...  tell her she can wait one more month lol ! good luck with your motor
