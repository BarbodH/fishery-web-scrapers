177958,nautifish,2008-03-28 14:42:00,1416,This site is basically where people can exchange things for free to try and help the inviroment and save it from going to the land fill.  Thought i had best explain what the link was i guess.

178149,nautifish,2008-03-28 20:35:00,1416,Well every little bit makes a difference i think.  If someone else can use what you no longer need and it saves it from going to land fill then i am all for it.
