177576,Ricz24,2008-03-27 20:35:00,18,Planning a trip to caesars lodge in early May we're booked for the 15th. Just wondering if anyone has been to a fly-in trophy outpost there. Im curious as how the fishing will be that early and also how thick of a winter jacket am i gonna need??!
177590,Roy,2008-03-27 20:59:00,13728,"Decent place to fish for sure. Two things to consider though. Walleye and pike both open the 16th of May. Also, that early in the year (you'll be the first batch of guests) there's a very good possibility of being iced in...especially this year. Stay in touch with them."
177623,irishfield,2008-03-27 21:56:00,26272,"Was just gonna say Roy it might be a tad early for float planes and boats! I'm gettin worried I'll be able to boat to my place on the 11th of May. Ice is now three feet thick on lake Temagami (up from 28"" on March 7th) and still making it every night right now."
177645,waterwolf,2008-03-27 22:41:00,556,"did the north end of kipawa on the 1st week of june a few years back and the ice was just receding. good call roy , may seems like it might be a bit early to book ceasars this year.  still making ice irish,, yikes ,,, good thing you got that new auger, might be using it more than you were hoping to though. lol.  come on spring!!!!  dug my tinnie out  , ready and impatiently waitng."
177820,Ricz24,2008-03-28 03:53:00,18," Thanks man, called them tonight ! They said we will have a three week notice if the ice holds up, and also that it seemed to start melting already so it should be OK....Hope so!! Thanks again"
