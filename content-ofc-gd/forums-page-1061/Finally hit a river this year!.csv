Kurto and a  buddy, Tim joined me for the trip.  We all expected to be a little rusty after a few months of tying instead of fishing!  We headed here for a sunny day of fun!!      After a stroll of 20 minutes or so, we parked ourselves on a stretch of river about 500 meters long, moving up and down, all around.      After an hour or so.......FISH ON!!!      Quite the battle ensued.  I left the very tip of my 7wt on a different river last fall.....so I was using my 5wt.  But finally, my buddy Tim dove in a scooped her out of her humble swamp.      And the release!!    Great way to start the season!!!!  Dave"
