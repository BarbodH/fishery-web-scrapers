178193,camillj,2008-03-28 21:56:00,1988,I just had to do it ... after seeing all the chrome being flashed shamelessly about ... so I went down to the freezer and sure enough there are still two 'vials' of the 'stuff' ... and it smells .... sweet !   So tomorrow early I am heading eastward (somewhere between Duffins and Shelter Valley - hopefully thats not too specific for anyone) to drift a few amongst the weekend warriors ...   Send me a PM (before 5 am)  if ya wanna hook up
