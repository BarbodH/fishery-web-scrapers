Just guessing that a lot of your waters have some good ones just not a heavily targeted species up there. My wife got them by accident while we were fishing for other species with a big chub under a slip bobber on a break line from shore 6 to 8 feet of water, deeper water near by.  A lot of ways to fish for them on purpose, cut bait, prepared bait, chicken livers on bottom rigs, slip bobber and a big chub just opens you up to other species also. We were targeting pickeral, pike, caught some a couple cats and gar also."

It will be starting very soon. I believe I will start fishing them next week at some of the smaller tribs. 3 or 4 dew worms on a hook is good early in the season then switch to cut bait like strips of sucker meat or cut shad later in the spring.
