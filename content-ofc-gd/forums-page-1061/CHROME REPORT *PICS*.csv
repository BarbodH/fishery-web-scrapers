Managed to get some spots to ourselves on a couple of our favourite tribs and put a beating on them, best day out so far this season.  Gonna be busy these next few days!!  Good luck to everyone and be respectful to your neighbouring anglers, give everyone space, catch and release when possible.  P.S. Yes I do realize I am gill holding some fish.                Great day out!"
