178463,sharper,2008-03-29 18:29:00,279,My buddy was able to hooked onto a nice pike with a lot of girth to it on our last outing. We are going to try again before the season closes.
178566,napjohn8,2008-03-29 21:24:00,46,"i am going to be going tommorow and sunday and have considered fishing the inner marines of the islands preferably centre island however, would you guys recommend going to fish the marinas, i was also considering humber bay west and east cause its an inner bay with docks, great locations for pike."
178638,forrest,2008-03-29 23:27:00,1032,Was at Frenchman's bay at mid day for a few hours.  The north end of the Bay is still under ice.  Out of the 7 people fishing in various spots on the bay many lines were cast without a single catch:  People were using: Jerk baits and shiners.  I threw out a slow spoon and a spinner for a few casts at the end.  Maybe a big twisty tail should have been tried?  At least it was a nice day.  forrest
178126,Ricz24,2008-03-28 19:38:00,18,Anyone have any news on pike fishing in toronto these past few days ? Anyone whos been casting away at the shores and bays of lake ontario looking for that monster let in on some news!....Good or bad! Thanks.
178128,Reef Runner,2008-03-28 19:49:00,981,"I've been out twice already and haven't caught a thing nor even seen a follow.  I am gonna give it another go however.  Just as a reminder, pike closes March 31 in Lake O...best of luck to all pike hunters in the next couple of days!  reefrunner"

178133,bbog,2008-03-28 20:05:00,665,Well done!
178134,irishfield,2008-03-28 20:06:00,26272,Yah.. we wanna see pictures of that tank ...
178137,Reef Runner,2008-03-28 20:15:00,981,Dang.
178141,Ricz24,2008-03-28 20:17:00,18,"sweet!!! Thats what im talking about!! Going out this weekend, we'll see how it goes....."
178146,Bitsmith2k,2008-03-28 20:33:00,396,"we've been out once, my buddy raised a couple from under a floating chunk of ice, but didnt connect.. this weekend we're going to give it one more shot.."
178191,Weeds,2008-03-28 21:52:00,782,"Bah, after countless outings I have concluded that Toronto Pike are the thing of fables, as great a fiction as Sasquatch, the Loch Ness monster or man walking on the moon. The images you see of anglers holding pike in Toronto are photo shopped; an elaborate hoax perpetrated by a devious few. Why?? Who knows. It's peverse I know. They don't blur the background to conceal prominent landmarks but the lushly wooded shores of places like Lake Vermillion or distant shores. You might be fooled by by what looks like something vaguely familliar ocassionally, as if the angler had accidently left some clue as to his location in the picture. More trickery I say! Those recognizable tidbits, say a rail road track or mooring dock are cropped into the image; a cruel bit of deceit if ever there was one, inserted just to keep you believing. Open your eyes! Believe no more!!"
178197,urbanangler1990,2008-03-28 22:11:00,933,"   hahahhaha that made me laugh! I REALLY HOPE UR SAYING THIS ONLY CUS OF UR LACK OF ABILITY TO HOOK A TO PIKE hahahah  i felt exactly like u, im riding some confidence now though  went 20 times no pike"
178210,Weeds,2008-03-28 22:39:00,782,  I prefer to think of it as the Pikes lack of ability to hit my artfully dodging lures..........
178213,urbanangler1990,2008-03-28 22:43:00,933," ur lures arnt dodging the right way, it must be done gracefully"
178215,Weeds,2008-03-28 22:49:00,782,Artfully and gracefully or just gracefully? Are you suggesting my technique is too artfull? How dare you.....
178229,urbanangler1990,2008-03-28 23:04:00,933,"  perhaps u dont know how to gracefully work the lure, or else u would have cought some  haha"
178230,Weeds,2008-03-28 23:09:00,782,Perhaps. Where's that pic of your 41inch replica?
178234,urbanangler1990,2008-03-28 23:13:00,933," oh its coming, just wait, i know ur on the edge of ur seat"
178235,forrest,2008-03-28 23:15:00,1032,So what is still iced and a right off?  I am going to hit at least one spot on the weekend if I do not see it as a right off here.  forrest
178237,urbanangler1990,2008-03-28 23:17:00,933,"  right off? what do u mean, its pretty much all open now"
178253,forrest,2008-03-28 23:49:00,1032,I was going to go last weekend but a buddy was squaking about bad weather and ice so I put no effort in.  If all is good now I will sneak out for a few hours.  forrest
178299,waterwolf,2008-03-29 01:29:00,556,"was out last saturday and was hoping to do the inner bays . way to much ice to get close. tried in the main bay at a marina . second cast brought a big fish out from a dock to investigate my husky jerk [gold with green back\orangebelly] wouldn't hit .  only brought the one rod ,, wished i had another one  with something else to get a strike on the follow-up cast. got a good look at a nice gator ,, just not as close as i would have liked. a security guard asked me politely to stick to the main lake ,, not the marina in my quest for fish . so i left her[ the pike] in peace honouring his position. the harbourfront is pretty much wide open , drove by twice this week and got a decent view of what's what on ice remaining."
178354,mikethespike,2008-03-29 05:17:00,51,"im gonna have a go @ it for the last 2 days on the 29th and 30th,  (wanted to take 31st off but the boss is also an angler and he knows what im up to   ) got my gear set up and cant wait to have 2 more stabs @ ""spring"" pike before it closes"
178410,highdrifter,2008-03-29 14:41:00,2534, LOL.  Were you alone?  Did anyone help you with this fish?  Where did you learn this mastery??!  Don't you think it's time you gave props when props is due?  I'd hate for you to go out another 20 times without a hook up...  HD
178412,irishfield,2008-03-29 14:42:00,26272,I'm still waiting for the pics of his 41 ....
178417,highdrifter,2008-03-29 14:53:00,2534, I've learned from my sources that the pick is on it's way..
178448,Weeds,2008-03-29 16:52:00,782,All kidding aside I'd love to see the pic too. 41? That's a big pike.
