177541,duber,2008-03-27 19:04:00,220,Just wondering if anyone knows were I can purchase a open water boat mounting kit or even just a  puck transducer so I can mount my fl8 on the front of my boat.I would rather buy it from somewere in Canada if I could.I can order it right from Vexilar but they only ship UPS in Canada and UPS realy socks it to you on customs processing fees.I would really like to have my flasher up front on my boat but if it costs to much I will just buy a cheaper sonar to put up there.  Thanks to all who replie.

177857,TroutnMuskieHunter,2008-03-28 10:59:00,1362, Duber...I just ordered a few things from Cabela's (close to $100) and they charged me $3 for brokerage fees and $12 for shipping via U.S. Postal service...one of the items is a trailer receiver hitch for my ATV and is fairly heavy....   Steve
