177522,highdrifter,2008-03-27 18:12:00,2534," I would gather she does..  A sensible lady that one is.  Still, a women's touch would go a long way here me thinks.  What say you TJ?  Aye Monique, ca vas faire quelques temps qu'on a pas eu de vos nouvelles..  Entre temps, cht'envoye une grosse caresse du nord!!  yyeeee HD"
177565,Bernie,2008-03-27 19:55:00,3190,Don't get too down and out G. You could end up like this guy. 
177567,Gerritt,2008-03-27 20:03:00,6129,I took that picture @ Lakair.... for those of you that dont know that is Pigeonfisher after he cleared all the booze out from his cottage   G
177570,pigeonfisher,2008-03-27 20:17:00,696,"I never found one of those comfortable head reasts...  That was a lot of drink that weekend.  I was able to trade it for rides in boats, food, other drink, smoked fish...the list goes on."
177592,irishfield,2008-03-27 21:03:00,26272,That's priceless Bernie !!
177928,Fish Farmer,2008-03-28 13:48:00,2234,"Gezz, and I missed that post  . I told you the other night I love reading your posts. We need guys like you Gerritt. Your my daily vitamin."
178104,Cookslav,2008-03-28 18:26:00,1457,Dang...missed something good did I? 
178120,tjsa,2008-03-28 19:15:00,1578," HEY...........SPEAK ENGLISH please(just kidding Fidel, (regardless, I cannot read or speak French, do know a couple of swear words though), and what did I miss................again...................  Some kinda dust-up on the board happened when I wasn't looking?????????? Oh well. I am probably better off not knowing.  Gerritt=soft..............................ummmh, I don't think so."
178125,highdrifter,2008-03-28 19:29:00,2534," HAHAH!  Monique's fluent in french, so I figured I'd send something a little more homely...  I said that it had been a while since we've had news from her, that i was sending her a big e-hug.  Want some cheese with your whine?  Good to know you're still out and about Tom.  It feels more like home this way...  HD"
178187,Clampet,2008-03-28 21:44:00,1947,I've suspected it fer awhile...now I'm certain..  There's something wrong with you.
178190,Terry,2008-03-28 21:47:00,14456,"if this board gets any ""softer"" all the guys will have to shave their armpits and start buying always"
178194,Tarzan's Jane,2008-03-28 21:57:00,1183,  Shaved armpits would be nice...really...and try tampons Super you wussss....
178199,tjsa,2008-03-28 22:14:00,1578," You just figgered that out...........................took you long enough, lol."
178203,tjsa,2008-03-28 22:19:00,1578,"HEY, wait a gall darn minute here, you talkin' bout me or highdrifter???????????  Either way, its probably true,   :lol:  :lol:  :lol:  Sorry HD."
178280,bigfish1965,2008-03-29 01:07:00,3382,Hug a mod day is way better than the old 'Kick a mod in the coins Day' we used to have.
178290,irishfield,2008-03-29 01:09:00,26272,Oh we'll still have those Rick... but only once a quarter..
178352,Greencoachdog,2008-03-29 04:47:00,8163, ... and they make a great catfish bait when you're finished with them!
177250,Gerritt,2008-03-27 02:14:00,6129,"I will do my best to be a positive role model vs. being a jerk (I know what your thinking... Gerritt you're never a jerk!) but even I am have my short comings  I know this happens every year... and every year I tend to get sucked in.. but I feel I need to stand up for what is right and for those that need/deserve to be defended.  Cabin fever sucks plain and simple..  But please guys lets try and respect one another... This happens EVERY year... and to be honest it makes it tough on the mods.. Believe me they dont enjoy deleting posts or modifying them based upon our  foolishness or lapse in judgement... I know.. I too have posts deleted.. as we all do...  I had a post deleted today.. and to be honest I thank the mod that did it.  Why? I was being defencive of people I call my friends ... and in doing so stooped to the offending posters level.. I should have known better and taken the high road... but I let my emotions get the better of me..  The mods here do a great job here trying to keep things somewhat civil...   I think we as adults should try and do the same..  So in closing I vote Thursday March 27th, HUG YOUR MOD DAY...  Gerritt"
177252,KyleM,2008-03-27 02:19:00,218,"If thats the case, we need some female mods."
177253,pigeonfisher,2008-03-27 02:19:00,696,"DANG, BEER, CHICKEN WINGS, ELITISM...  Formerly from Paul Dillons Garage Floor....Presently residing in Grand Valley...Soon to be Resident of New Oxford, PA.  Just wake up and enjoy..."
177258,irishfield,2008-03-27 02:30:00,26272,"Dang Gerritt.. was that your choice... ""I promise"" or Mod Q ?"
177259,nofish4me,2008-03-27 02:33:00,404,"  Didn't see a whinning smiley.  Change your Avatar, I'm tired of hittin' the stop button. Hehehehe"
177261,huntervasili,2008-03-27 02:34:00,1604," Dang, I figured that this was the year... ohh well maybe next time  ... Thanks for taking the time mod's sometimes a thankless job where you can be called anything from A-Z and beyond, but appreciate the time boys."
177263,Gerritt,2008-03-27 02:35:00,6129,  Wayne... my choice... for once! LOL... I just saw what was happening and decided I wanted to be part of the solution... I know I have had my moments... being on here for 7 years does that to a fella... and yes I have opinions on different people...  But at the end of the day..... I just want this to work... as I know you do too..  G
177264,TJQ,2008-03-27 02:35:00,7806, ok...  hug your mod day... i like it...
177265,Gerritt,2008-03-27 02:36:00,6129,nofish4me... Perhaps you just dont get it yet...   G
177266,huntervasili,2008-03-27 02:37:00,1604," Yea dont go any farther than that Gerritt, regardless of your feelings."
177272,nofish4me,2008-03-27 02:43:00,404," I must have been busy with life, sorry I missed the post. Yer probably right, I don't always get it.  Hehehe (my attempt to portrait no hard feelings)."
177273,OhioFisherman,2008-03-27 02:44:00,6623,"Sorry you had to move out Steve, just as I was getting used to you. I just don`t make the beer runs well any more. New Oxford? a bit east of Somerset Pa on US 30 the long way to my house, use the PA turnpike to I 76. I know it`s not hockey but you can ski in the area around Somerset, Seven Springs was a nice resort."
177275,irishfield,2008-03-27 02:46:00,26272,All I can say Gerritt is with what you were offering the guy I sure hope he wasn't gay and took it the wrong way!  Not that there's anything wrong with that.....
177278,FishFinder,2008-03-27 02:55:00,481,"Thanks for finally manning up Gerrit, I hope this time you stick with it"
177279,2 tone z71,2008-03-27 03:00:00,1311,do my best SIS YES SIR
177303,Bernie,2008-03-27 04:16:00,3190,  JK Gerritt. Came across this and I needed a place to put it. LOL

177309,HTHM,2008-03-27 05:36:00,4082,WHAT! There has been a difference of opinion on this board! Scandalous!
177311,Tarzan's Jane,2008-03-27 07:29:00,1183,"I'll go first....  MMMMMMMMMMM......Hugs    for the Mods   Thanks guys...especially Roy for playing ""ping pong"" with my special threads from the past...and my requests to have them deleted.  You all do a fantastic job."
177316,maybe,2008-03-27 08:49:00,307,"I'm next!  {{{{{{{{{{{mods}}}}}}}}}}}  Many thanks!  Now c'mon, guys...don't leave it to us girls to do all the hugging around here.  It's your turn!"
177388,irishfield,2008-03-27 13:34:00,26272,Does Monique still have Mod access... if so I'll go next...
177445,Terry,2008-03-27 15:08:00,14456,come on Gerritt you're one of the people that make this board what it is.......  just be yourself........  and party on dude
177478,Gerritt,2008-03-27 16:32:00,6129,Wow... it appears I am looking a bit soft in this post LOL... that was not my intention... but I guess after beer #8 things took a more sensitive tone...  ok enough of that... Back to basics!   G
177491,Mike Pike,2008-03-27 16:54:00,1332,It'd still take me more than 8 beers to wanna hug a Mod.
