177977,nautifish,2008-03-28 15:09:00,1416,Well with winter over APPARENTLY....LOL......  I thought i would share a couple of pictures.  Wednesday evening was such a glorias evening i decided to take a drive over to the LPB Conservation erea. It had been an absolutley beautiful day the bird's were all busy at the feeder's in my back garden. Even had two turkey vultures flying around out back of the house. The geese are flying back and fourth again in large numbers over my home to the lake. Have seen many whistler swans again this year.  I wake up this morning and find everything is covered with snow again.  Grrr!  So i thought i would add just a couple of the many photo's i took the other evening. Won't be long now and we will all be complaining about it being too hot and having the cut crass......lol....
