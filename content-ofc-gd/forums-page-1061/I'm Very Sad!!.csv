177851,Roy,2008-03-28 10:49:00,13728,"Yeah I remember that Brian. Man were they ever cheering loud that night! And with good reason too. Afterall, they had made it to 18th place in a league of 30 teams!!!! :-)"
177865,SlowPoke,2008-03-28 11:31:00,2984,"Ahhh, the good 'ole days. ""We're #18, We're #18""... that was quite the party! All kidding aside, the Senators still suck. -Brian"

177871,SlowPoke,2008-03-28 11:41:00,2984,"Just to be fair to Hab's fans....

177874,Roy,2008-03-28 11:55:00,13728,That's hilarious Brian. I think the altitude might have affected what little grey matter they might have had. Good one.
177875,JEREMY,2008-03-28 12:00:00,300,Yes its true the leafs are out but they would kick the habs donkey at golf anyday.lol
177878,Roy,2008-03-28 12:07:00,13728,"That's true Jeremy. And let's, just fer fun not give either of them a net. They apparently don't DO nets."
177923,Golfisher,2008-03-28 13:37:00,586,"I am SHOCKED, SHOCKED, I tell ya!!!!"
177946,Kirk,2008-03-28 14:27:00,347,I knew they were done after the trade deadline.  Sens are probably still worried about how they can avoid getting eliminated by the Leafs in the playoffs. LOL
177992,Casey123,2008-03-28 15:39:00,461,i would like to know at what point this season they were in contention?
177996,Ramble,2008-03-28 15:46:00,713,"FINALLY!!!  Now i can bust out the ""How do you know spring is here? Cause the leafs are out!"" Joke. HaHa i'm so glad i'm not a leaf fan lololol  -R-"
177998,Headhunter,2008-03-28 15:46:00,5703,"I feel sorry for Hab fans... at least we Leaf fans have no expectations of success, therefore, we have no real sense of loss as a result of ""our"" teams results... where as you Hab fans actually think your team will have a measure of success this year in the playoffs... they are already over due for their late season swoon... GO Jays GO! LOL! HH PS... I bet Leaf players are better fishemen than Hab players... they have way more time on the water!   OK, I'll stop, I'm hurting myself!"
178004,irishfield,2008-03-28 15:51:00,26272,"So Joe... you gonna help those lads re-pile the road block parts again this year on your corner, or you had enough of that?"
178005,Headhunter,2008-03-28 15:52:00,5703,
178059,walleyejigger,2008-03-28 17:16:00,876,"GO HABS GOOOOOOOOOOO  sooo which western conference bandwagon r u leafs fans gonna jump on now, lemme guess detroit? san jose?  or will u stick to east and the old ""who ever plays montreal"" or ""who ever play ottawa""   GOOOOOOOOO HABS GOOOOOOOOOOOOO   i'm sure saturdays game will be very entertaining, last chance for the leafs to go out with a little dignity  GOOOOOOOOOO HABS GOOOOOOOOOOO"
178070,Roy,2008-03-28 17:24:00,13728,"Hey WalleyeJigger, don't hatchet your counts before they chicken. We've seen this scenario more than once. Whatever happens, most will have done their best."
178074,walleyejigger,2008-03-28 17:28:00,876,"  ur right, i think,  i've never hatcheted any counts,  just need to get some ribbing in while i can because the tables will turn evetually, hopefully later than sooner"
178081,Mike Pike,2008-03-28 17:41:00,1332,"Well, us Leaf fans can be accused of many things but bandwagon jumpers???  I don't think so.  We stick with the Leafs through thin no matter how bad things get.  Now, Habs fans on the other hand...  (lol)"
178159,DanTheMan,2008-03-28 20:56:00,257,"I dont care what they say about the Habs this year,  THIS IS ALL GRAVY BOYS!!!!  So what ever happens , HAPPENS.
