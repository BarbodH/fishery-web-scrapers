177773,krawler,2008-03-28 02:32:00,167,"I tried the mouth of the humber this evening, no luck but the water was clear, there has only been one rain event, melting and high water level.  cant imagine all the fish pushed there way through.  i got the roe and even some worms which works well on gbay surf fishing.  so ill head out sunday am and see if i can coax a few fish out of the surf, thanks for the responses and pm's.  keep em coming though.  thanks  krawler"
