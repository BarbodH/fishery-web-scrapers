Did not take long for my friend  and i to pack up and head to the bait store just on the other side of the 400 entrance ramp going towards orrillia, chatted with the ncie lady there for a while and headed out to our spot up by six mile . It took a while of moving around and about five holes later finally got a couple perch and two crappie. Kept the two crappie for a snack lol. My friend caught a baby pike had to be about 10 inches lol. It was nice to get out for a day of fishing. Plus it beat yesterday when we headed to a different spot and caught nothing. I would have  a pic of the two crappie but its on my friends disposable. Going out tomorrow to catch more.(maybe)"
