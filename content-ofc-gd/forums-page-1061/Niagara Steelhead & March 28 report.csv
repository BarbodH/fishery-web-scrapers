Roe, kwick fish, yarn flies, rubber eggs......mixing things up and moving around have been the key!  Here's a few from the 17 hook ups today:      Check out the Niagara Steelhead taken on the Fly Rod......Well done!    Water above the dams is very clear, today below the dams had 3 feet of green vis  perfect!!!     Good mix of fresh silver and darker spawner's in the lower river right now. We landed three loose hens this week!      Niagara's Rocking right now! Enjoy the early spring bite........   See you on the river,"
