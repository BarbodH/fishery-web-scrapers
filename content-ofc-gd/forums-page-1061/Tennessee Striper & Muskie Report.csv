This year Corey and I were fortunate to get out with a couple of guys (Mike and Erik) I had met through one of the boards down there for a day of Muskie and Striper Fishing.  Got out on the water around 7:30, and it was around 45 outside. Erik had just picked up his new boat.  A River Pro.  For those that havent seen one here's what they can do...incredible  Some pics of the ride for the day...     Corey ducking out of the morning chill going close to 55 mph...   About an hour into it, we had a striper hit and we missed it, we were trolling using planner boards. Things quieted down so we went into a little bay and tried it for some MUSKIES IN MARCH.  I had a follow from a mid 30's 'ski on a TEP spinner bait.  It was sure nice throwing the big baits again...    Then lunch time went to Mc.D's then tried another river, we saw some fish that I'm sure were close to fifty pounds in about 2 feet of water.    just couldn't get 'em to hit.  So we went back to the lake that we started at, soon enough we had a hit.  MISS, went back around BANG!!! FISH ON, here is the video of a bit of the fight and me getting a sledge in the arse   trying to get some of the other lines in.    The agreement was Corey would get the shot at the first rod going off and he did very well  A 22 pound Striper      One from the cell phone   Not five minutes later going back around the same spot had another one hit, felt the weight grabbed the rod and gone  .  A beautiful fishing day in Tennessee, we saw our first striper, made a couple of great friends and best of all we got to fish in T SHIRTS...   But sadly that day had to come to an end...   Hope you enjoyed, Jim"
