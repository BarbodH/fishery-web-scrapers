177891,John,2008-03-28 12:48:00,2956,"I rear-ended a car this morning.  So there we are alongside the road and the driver slowly gets out of the car . . . and you know how you just-get-sooo-stressed and life-stuff seems to get funny? Yeah, well, I could NOT believe it . . . he was a DWARF!  He storms over to my car, looks up at me and says, 'I AM NOT HAPPY!'  So, I look down at him and say, 'Well, which one are you then?'  . . . and that's when the fight started . ."
177892,pigeonfisher,2008-03-28 12:50:00,696,that is one of the funnier jokes of all time.
177904,rickster,2008-03-28 13:14:00,495,one of the best i've heard in a looooonnnnggggg time
177911,Roy,2008-03-28 13:19:00,13728,I love that joke. Almost as good as DanC's sock joke.  Thanks

177937,Roy,2008-03-28 14:16:00,13728,"True story! TJ, Spiel and Rick were out on Nipissing last June and Spiel fell overboard.....TJ dove in after him, brought him to the surface and commenced giving him mouth to mouth when Rick said ""Hey TJ, I don't remember Spiel having a skidoo suit on?"""
177940,Joey,2008-03-28 14:19:00,9122,"Well the first joke is believable, but the second joke can only be fiction  Joey"

177945,Roy,2008-03-28 14:27:00,13728,"DanC is much better at telling jokes than I am but...  A man gets up one morning to find his wife already in the kitchen cooking. He looks to see what she’s cooking, and sees one of his socks in the frying pan.  “What are you doing?” he asks. “I’m doing exactly what you asked me to do last night when you came to bed very drunk,” she replied  Completely puzzled, the man walks away thinking to himself, “I don’t remember asking her to cook my sock…”"
177948,John,2008-03-28 14:33:00,2956," You know, with those three, could be believable........."
177950,John,2008-03-28 14:35:00,2956, Like this one a lot. It's been around a while but is one of the classics.
178098,LeXXington,2008-03-28 18:10:00,1928,"  LOL, too funny a wife, listening and doing what you told her..."
178145,bbog,2008-03-28 20:33:00,665,Won't touch that one!

178154,Tarzan's Jane,2008-03-28 20:48:00,1183,I guess I am in one of my moods....but....every now and then I read a comment about Roy's height.  Can someone tell me just how tall is he already????  I guess it's a guy thing...you have to raz each other relentlessly.  I am also asking because I want to know if I should wear heels when I am with him.... God I love wine.
178155,irishfield,2008-03-28 20:49:00,26272,"Guys only raz Roy because they are jealous of his height. The height they wished they all were, during high school dances and such......"
178156,Tarzan's Jane,2008-03-28 20:51:00,1183,D'uh...so you have never mearsured the guy...is that what you are saying Mr. Irish.  lol
