177556,Hookset,2008-03-27 19:30:00,367," Hi Wayne and Thank You. I did try candlelight because that's what we have here at work, but they don't cover my area. I'm just outside of their coverage. The only provider we could find (so far) was Hughes - Galaxy. Talk about an exasperating experience...   Hookset."

177568,Guest lundboy,2008-03-27 20:09:00,0," Does this pertain to your area in anyway?  http://www.huntsvilleforester.com/huntsvil...r/article/59756 http://www.corebroadband.ca/index-4.html  Wireless Internet spreads to new areas of Muskoka by  Allyson Snelling Jan 16, 2008                                                                               	                 Residents of west Gravenhurst, portions of northern Bracebridge and around the community of MacTier now have the ability to accelerate their Internet connection from dial-up to wireless.  A press release issued on Monday by Muskoka Community Network (MCN) said areas including west Gravenhurst and portions of Springdale Park, Falkenburg Station and Stephenson Road 1 near Hwy. 11 in Bracebridge are the first areas to be serviced by a project to bring high-speed Internet to Muskoka with government funding from FedNor.  Within the township of Georgian Bay, high-speed Internet has also been expanded south and west of MacTier.  The newly established wireless broadband coverage is expected to reach 80 per cent of the unserviced population in the newly serviced areas, the release indicated.  “For the past two years, Muskoka Community Network has been working hard to bring high-speed Internet to the 12,000 Muskoka-based businesses and residents operating without it,” said Rob McPhee, executive director of Muskoka Community Network.  “Thanks to substantial funding from FedNor, and the efforts of Core Broadband in building the necessary infrastructure, our plans are coming to fruition.”  Residents in these areas who would like to determine eligibility for high-speed wireless Internet on this network can contact a Core Broadband reseller at www.corebroadband.ca or obtain a complete list of Internet service providers in Muskoka by visiting www.mcnet.ca/servicedirectory/ISP/.  In addition, high-speed wireless service is expected in the town of Huntsville during the first quarter of 2008 and in the township of Lake of Bays by the third quarter of 2008, said the release.  McPhee said coverage will continue to improve as more towers come online through the $1.7-million grant from FedNor for the development of infrastructure to deliver broadband to unserviced areas.  When questioned about the private sector’s ability to provide high-speed Internet to the same areas MCN is hoping to service, McPhee said MCN’s “open-access network” allows private sector Internet service providers to offer wireless service to residents in that network.  “The whole reason this project exists is because the private sector was not servicing these areas,” he explained. “If they want to go in, they can do so on their own initiative, but we understand they don’t want to because it’s economically unfeasible.  “We changed our business case to make it more attractive and are using an open-access network because we’re hoping they will join the network and resell the service. As the infrastructure is built, other Internet service providers can get on the network.”  For those unable to access high-speed wireless service, satellite high-speed may be available, he added.  Gravenhurst to receive high-speed service 18 months early Neil Smellie of Core Broadband said wireless Internet access could be up and running further south in Kilworthy, Kahshe Lake, Houseys Rapids and Barkway as soon as eight weeks from now. Approximately 20 per cent of the population may not be able to receive service due to terrain or low elevation issues, MCN has reported.  Through a partnership with the town of Gravenhurst, 190-foot free-standing communication towers will be installed at two fire station sites, providing high-speed Internet access to the rural communities. Smellie said the towers are expected to be shipped to the sites this week.  The service is coming to Gravenhurst sooner because of the town’s mutual interest in improved communication through upgraded radio equipment for the safety and protection of the public works department and volunteer fire department.  Representatives of both departments indicated without the new tower and radio equipment there are some remote rural areas of the municipality where there is no radio service.  The cost of the towers and radio equipment is $76,000, $50,000 of which will be assigned to the 2008 budget. The remaining $26,000 will be carried over from the fire department’s 2007 budget."
177790,Riparian,2008-03-28 03:05:00,269,"I liked Waynes idea. Find someone close with a hardline and buy your own gear. It would cost a bit more, but I wish I had done that from the get go instead of installing the crap I have now.  Sorry things havent worked out for you Hookset. But loosing the highspeed and the online gaming world was the choice I made when I moved out here.  It would take quite a bit to send me back to the city. I love the sticks and my 100 acres, my woodlot, the deer, wild turkeys and lack of neighbors make it worthwile."
177795,irishfield,2008-03-28 03:10:00,26272, Hey.. are you living behind my hangar and I haven't noticed yet? If so start plowing some of the snow would ya!
175553,grt1,2008-03-24 14:32:00,638,"We live in the boonies of North western Ontario, outside of red lake, and have radio phones and satellite internet. What we did in our little subdivision is went in with the neighbours and got the satellite internet , originally it was from directway, who then sold it to hughes , who then sold it to xplornet.  while it isn't really high speed it is defineately faster than dial up and we are going house to house through a wireless router. it seems that you can buy different amounts of band width and the speed increase with each increase in band width.  currently we are paying about $30 each per month and the total cost per month is about $100 for the bandwidth we have. if you have the satellite stuff in your house and don't run it through a router I would suspect the speed would be faster than what we get in our houses since the router seems to limit the speed to 54 mps.  It is a fairly reliable system andfor those of us without phone lines it is a viable option."
175556,Hookset,2008-03-24 14:40:00,367," Hi michaelw,  I now live just West of a town called Utterson. I moved from Baysville about 6 years ago. Lived there for about 5 years. We still have some family there and they have Sympatico Lite. I'm think they could have gotten high speed but not positive. They live just outside of town, East of the river. I will try to find out for sure as to what's available. Just don't take Sympatico's word as to types of available service, they don't have a clue about the services that they provide. Go figure...  Nice to see another OFC'er moving to the area soon. If you like Bass fishing (trout too I should say) you're moving to the right area... we can talk   Hookset.   and Thanks as well grt1 - I'll have to check out that option."
175567,Riparian,2008-03-24 15:31:00,269,"I couple year back I had a bell sympatico dial up account that cost me 24 bucks a month. I used it at work and where ever I could get at a 56k modem. I was always suprised at how well it worked. I was achieving 49 kbs download speeds.  If you plan on doing much online gaming, or file sharing with torrent programs, then dialup wont work for you. If you only check e-mail and surf the web I had no problems and I was rarely waiting for pages to load. Pictures came in quite quickly.  I currently have a point to point system at my house coming from a grain elevator. It cost me big bucks to install, and is not much faster than that dial up account. In fact I wouldnt call it high speed. I cant play online games or seed torrents properly.  If i could make the choice again I would have kept my sympatico account and paid for another phone line. the sympatico account was unlimited use."

177543,Hookset,2008-03-27 19:06:00,367,"Well I gotta say...what a freaking joke !!!  Hughes net was installed 8 days ago. 5 minutes after the installer left our system went for a crap. It took us upwards of 3 minutes to open a browser. To open OFC at home takes about 7 minutes just to open the first page. Called Hughes net...after running a diagnostic they say ""Oh it's a crosbol problem, you're installer will have to come back out and fix it"" Ok says old dumbass (me), thanks for the info... 5 days later the tech. arrives. ""You've exceeded your bandwidth and that's the problem"". Off he went. My girlfriend was home at the time so I didn't get a chance to speak with him myself. Then I get a call from Hughes net (Galaxy actually which buys from Hughes ??!!??) ""Yes there is a problem with exceeded bandwidth and due to that fact, we can't check the crosbol issue. ""But the system hasn't worked properly since day 1"" I say. ""We did try to download a file, very sorry for doing so, but can you confirm if there is still a crosbol problem ?"" ""Not until some time tomorrow"" she says. ""But you have already confirmed that there was a crosbol problem"" I whimpered. ""That's all I can do sir, but if you would like to pay another 20 bucks a month we can bump you up to 375 megs of download every 24 hours instead of the 200 you currently have."" It was at about this time that I went for a walk, kicked myself in the cajones, and came back to try and reach the installation Tech. He was to have called me back 2 hours ago... He even gave me his cell #... Thing is I've been overly polite and patient up to this point.  But me thinks I'm about ready to snap. The total installation, purchase of hardware etc. was $900.00 and my monthly rate is $69.99 / month. But hey I can pay another 20 bucks per month for more bandwidth...on a system that hasn't worked since day 1.  Sorry about the rant, but if you see a big glow in the sky south of Huntsville, it's just my head exploding.   Hookset."
