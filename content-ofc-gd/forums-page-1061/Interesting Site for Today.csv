"" Our phosphorescent powder is doped with the         element Europium, along with other rare earth elements that give it an         astonishing glow         time of over 12 hours! It is both non-radioactive and non-toxic.""  http://www.unitednuclear.com/glow.htm  All kinds of interesting stuff on this site, including magnets so strong they can crush fingers! (might be good for lure retrieval)"

177882,Greencoachdog,2008-03-28 12:21:00,8163,  Those magnets might be strong enough to pull in let's say a bicycle?... Hey Snag!...
