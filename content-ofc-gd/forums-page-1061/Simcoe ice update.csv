177852,turtle,2008-03-28 10:50:00,274,"I was out twice this week.  Virginia all day on Monday-at least 24 inches of good ice, cars and trucks on the ice (we parked on shore), shoreline ice still good-fishing was real slow.  Yesterday morning at Port Bolster-still at least 24 inches of ice but the ice there was mostly white.  Shore ice starting to go where there is water flow into the lake but still no problem.  Trucks still on ice (I parked on shore). Fishing much better-caught approx 30 perch and kept 12 in four hours, approx 20-25 FOW."
177855,Dondorfish,2008-03-28 10:55:00,1000,Thanks for the up-date. I'll be out there tomorrow trying for that one last feed of fresh perch. We'll be out on Cook's Bay.   Don

178143,Sinker,2008-03-28 20:23:00,8692,"Me too......I was out monday and it was pretty good for the few hours I fished. I'd say port bolster area is where I'll be, but ya never know where I'll end up from there.  Sinker"
