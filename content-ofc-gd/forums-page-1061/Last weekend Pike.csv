178035,Bly,2008-03-28 16:40:00,1556,"Thanks for the report Anton.   As many have said, at least you had a follow.  I had not been fishing for about 20 years when I took the sport up again.  Started fishing in Aug and was out many times a week, sometimes twice a day, skunked.   Heard many comments ""there are no fish in there"" ""why would anyone want to catch fish from there"" and of course the ones that you could just barely hear...something to do with a woman fishing and the snickers....  I did my best to remember anything that I could from years past about fishing, taking note from anyone that would offer tips or advise, trying new locations but most importantly, I kept trying.   One cold October night....it all paid of big time.   Landed my first ever walleye.....33""  13lbs...will never forget that night.    Keep fishing and you will catch em!  PS.  If I could catch pike, I would gladly offer you any tips I had  lol"
