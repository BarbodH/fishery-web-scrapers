178372,Big Cliff,2008-03-29 12:26:00,6899,A friend has come up with a new product for the hunting/fishing industry and is just working on the advertising materials for the hunting side of it. He needs a picture of a bow hunter in his camo prefferably with a deer in the picture.  If anyone can help it would be much appreciated and I would need permission to use the picture. (not sure what is required here perhaps TJ could email me a copy of a waver that he uses or something). There is no money involved but I can probably swing some free samples of the product for who ever submits the picture that gets used.    Thanks  Big Cliff
