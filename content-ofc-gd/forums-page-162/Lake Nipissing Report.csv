928499,mattyk,2015-08-09 10:41:00,2110,"We just got back from a awesome two week vacation on Lake Nipissing. We live in Delaware but I always make a it a priority to take my kids to Canada to spend time with the grandparents and also experience the Canadian outdoors. We stayed on the eastern end of the lake. The first week was really hot and it was over 30 degrees every day and I think the water almost got up to to 78 degrees. The second week was much cooler and the water temperatures came down a lot to about 72-74 degrees with a constant west wind that was very high and made it tough to get out onto the water for long periods of time. There were several large thunderstorms too.  The waves were big and it was rough out there. This fishing was great for short windows of time, usually right before a front came through or early in the morning between 6:00 - 7:00 and later at night from about 7:30 - 9:00. between those times we would be able to catch about 10-15 fish in a really short period of time. We were constantly catching Smallmouth, walleye, sheephead and a few pike. We caught a few fish on lures but most of the fish were on live bait and jigs. My son and daughter both caught their first ever pike, walleye and sheephead and they were so excited. The great thing was that we never knew what was on the other end of the line, which made it really exciting. I spent most of my time helping my kids catch fish. I did get a chance to fish for short periods of time and I caught a few nice fish. I caught my PB northern pike and smallmouth bass. We actually did really well with a dropshot rig. The smallmouth, walleye and sheephead to my surprise really liked them alot. My son also got a sucker and catfish that way which was surprising. We caught a lot of walleye on our trip but most of the fish where under the slot size. I think we got two that were just at 46cm which you could keep, but we let them go. I will let the pics do the rest of the talking.                        "
928500,Joeytier,2015-08-09 10:57:00,3990,Awesome.  This is why I love the nip!  Fantastic fishery for sure
928502,spincast,2015-08-09 11:15:00,3279,That's making the best of some sketchy weather ; great report - love the kid's smiles.
928503,can u fish,2015-08-09 11:22:00,326,Looks like you all had a great holiday thanks for the report and great photos.  Cheers Mitch
928504,esoxansteel,2015-08-09 11:59:00,1307,"Great report, and kids outdoors having fun, doesn't get any better then that"
928507,G.mech,2015-08-09 12:19:00,830,"That report almost brings a tear to my eye but it reminds me of so many great times.  We took our vaca every year on the East end of Nipissing with our 2 kids and another family from Texas.  We fished for almost everything and many PB's were set and broken over and over again.  About 4 years ago, almost overnight it seems,  they got all grown up, got summer jobs, headed to university and decided hangin' with Mom and Dad wasn't quite as cool as it used to be.  We are still very close and fish whenever we can but those Nipissing summer vaca days are just fond memories.  Enjoy your years with the kids, fish lots, and take lots of pictures, they grow up far too fast it seems.  PS  you should maybe let your son pick out the hats next time, he has much better taste in hockey teams!"
928512,glen,2015-08-09 12:49:00,2641,Great pics.  Nice size fish.  Must have been happy with that.
928513,Beavertail,2015-08-09 12:52:00,331,"Sounds like a great way to spend two weeks, and judging by the smiles on your kid's faces I'm sure they'll remember these times for the rest of their lives. That was also a solid Pike you caught there, well done. Thanks for sharing."
928521,Walleye72,2015-08-09 13:11:00,156,Wow!  You guys did alright!  Lots of smiles and fish to go around.  Nice Report and pics.
928526,Old Ironmaker,2015-08-09 13:28:00,8243,"Nip is the place I caught most of my first ever fish. I started when I was 30, great family memories from west of Callander.  A fantastic report you D.P. some of those fish are as big as the tykes. Keep it going because as G. Mech sais they won't be coming with the old foggies sooner than later."
928528,2 tone z71,2015-08-09 13:40:00,1311,Awesome report ..lots of smiles going around ..if that maple leafs hat brings luck I may have to get one lol
928542,Joey,2015-08-09 15:09:00,9122,"Wow, those are some impressive fish there bud.  Great report and pics."
928564,manitoubass2,2015-08-09 17:35:00,11391,"Awesome!  Reports with the kids are always ten times better?  That pike has some shoulders!  Great job, awesome report!"
928565,misfish,2015-08-09 18:02:00,29133,Great great report. Look at the smiles. They make it all worth while dont they. Great looking kids.  Did you think of cooking up one of the sheeps?
928611,Rod Caster,2015-08-10 01:29:00,5784,"Nice sheephead/freshwater drum! I love catching them, they fight like trains."
928628,Steelheadphycho,2015-08-10 03:24:00,470,Memories to last a lifetime !!!  Great fish as well !!  Thanks for sharing!
928644,mattyk,2015-08-10 09:06:00,2110,Thanks for all the comments. We had a blast and the fishing was good despite the weather. The sheephead were tough fish and they fought really hard on our light gear! I have never ate a sheephead before and wasn't sure how to cook it up or clean it. Are they good to eat?
928649,misfish,2015-08-10 11:24:00,29133,"Clean as norm, cut into small chunks and steam or boil. Poor mans lobster."
928671,Whopper,2015-08-10 13:43:00,2174,Awesome report Matt. Your children are growing up fast  Thanks for sharing
928684,4x4bassin,2015-08-10 14:47:00,1025,Great report and some beauty fish to boot . Betcha the kids had a blast
928984,mistyriver1,2015-08-11 18:16:00,600,Good stuff Matt !  Hope all is well.
929106,Old Ironmaker,2015-08-12 05:09:00,8243,"You can eat Fresh Water Drum (sheepshead), Smoke them on a cedar plank like a Salmon. Take them off the plank, throw the fish out and eat the plank.  Maybe a Bouillabaisse. Let me know how they taste."
929111,BillM,2015-08-12 10:37:00,17367,Kids look like they had a lot of fun!  Dad to!
