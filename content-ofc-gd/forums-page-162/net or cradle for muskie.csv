928468,Raf,2015-08-09 02:05:00,3495,"100% net.  the cradle is dangerous at best with two people and impossible with one.  just my opinion. if you are concerned about space, there's the foldable deals."
928470,Dan668,2015-08-09 02:08:00,1120,"Definitely a net.  Frabill Big Game,  or the Power stow and replace the mesh with the big games,  pricier but saves some space."
928472,2 tone z71,2015-08-09 02:13:00,1311,Thanks fellas that's what I was thinking ..the cradle is gonna be a pain
928476,glen,2015-08-09 02:34:00,2641,"Anything over 54"" I use a net.  The rest I just shake off at the side of the boat."
928479,irishfield,2015-08-09 02:59:00,26272,"LOL Glen !  Stowmaster folding net Darrell and get the ""tennis"" bag to store it in to keep the boat neat."

928481,irishfield,2015-08-09 03:19:00,26272,Thorpe nets them and then when everything is ready out of the net for one quick picture and into a cradle to revive and measure boat side. Seems to work good..
928484,Bondar,2015-08-09 04:01:00,817,Net x100 I have a big beckman but frabil will do
928492,Old Ironmaker,2015-08-09 05:31:00,8243,"Net, a no brainer. If you get the foldable net make sure the tennis bag isn't black."
928496,Gregoire,2015-08-09 07:51:00,1397,"Another vote for the net. Makes it easier to unhook them while in the water, or better yet to cut the hooks. A few years ago got into the habit of just cutting the points off of hooks on anything that looked like it would be complicated.  Can also use the mesh as a jaw spreader, which is generally easier on the fish and easier than using jaw spreaders."
928508,scugpg,2015-08-09 12:36:00,1373,X2 for stowmaster with case - think the powerstow is very similar.
928555,LostAnotherOne,2015-08-09 16:41:00,956,Net for sure.  Cradles suck
928659,BillM,2015-08-10 12:51:00,17367,Just gaff them.
928669,irishfield,2015-08-10 13:26:00,26272,This is what happened the last time you did that Bill...    
928672,BillM,2015-08-10 13:46:00,17367,"I should have known you'd post that, lol!"
928675,linweir,2015-08-10 13:55:00,202,"Net is for sure handy, but I will keep both on boat."
928677,AKRISONER,2015-08-10 14:17:00,5558,"if you are on a budget, get a cradle, if you can afford the ridiculous pricing of a net then get a net.  Nets are 100% better, but if you dont have hundreds to spend on one a 40 dollar lucky strike big game cradle works just fine. Ive even been using the cradel bass fishing.  Its obviously impossible to use by yourself, but landing big fish in the cradle with 2 people isnt so bad, my only concern mainly is dropping the cradle in the lake while trying to unhook big fish, aside from that its not bad at all."
928680,2 tone z71,2015-08-10 14:19:00,1311,I already ordered the net thanks fellas
929066,Handlebarz,2015-08-12 00:08:00,3790,Good call on the net I would never ask anyone to land a fish for me for fear of the hooks coming out and them getting hooks in the face.  I do use my cradle to release tired fish if it's to rough to hold in the water by hand.
929075,2 tone z71,2015-08-12 00:43:00,1311,Thanks Mike appreciate the input ..I do like the idea of using a cradle to revive
