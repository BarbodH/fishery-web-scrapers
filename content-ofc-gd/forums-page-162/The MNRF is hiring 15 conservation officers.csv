929354,manitoubass2,2015-08-13 16:55:00,11391,I lived in alberta when I was a safety consultant in the oilfield.  Brutal drivers  Everymoring about 5am I see drucks in the ditch like crazy.  They think they have big tires and a lifted truck means you can go 120 around a corner mid winter.  Its rediculous
929370,Acountdeleted,2015-08-13 18:17:00,2562,"Manatou, we gotta meet up sometime. I feel like we'd have lots to talk about."
929376,manitoubass2,2015-08-13 18:40:00,11391,Absolutely?
929383,manitoubass2,2015-08-13 19:21:00,11391,Where ya located Jeremy?  Seems i remember youve passed by my area a few times if i remember correct???  Shag is coming for a visit soon thats gonna be a blast!  Im basically in between winnipeg and thunder bay
929408,Acountdeleted,2015-08-13 21:49:00,2562,"Whoops. I have passed by there in my younger days and probably lived pretty close for a while (worked out of red lake for a time). I figured from your username you were either living in Manatou or on the Manatoulin islands. That being said, I'm due to get back up that way again and I want to take my grandfather fishing in Ear Falls at Bluffy lake. Just need a job that gives me vacation time."
929410,misfish,2015-08-13 22:00:00,29133," LOL OK I have met you. How much younger? LOL  For those of you that have thrown your hats in the ring, best of luck to you."
929414,Acountdeleted,2015-08-13 22:17:00,2562,Fresh faced out college. When I was 23 I did 2 years in Western Ontario. Going through there on the way to and from Edmonton doesn't count. Though I wish I stayed longer.  (I'm 31 in October  That's supposed to be a B and a ) but that works too.
929415,misfish,2015-08-13 22:20:00,29133," (I'm 31 in October    Cripes, I thought you were 20. Guess I shouldnt be surprised. Some think Im 30ish. LOL"
929416,Acountdeleted,2015-08-13 22:27:00,2562,Thanks bud. I got lucky. Both my pa and my grandad look about 15 years younger then they are too. Guess it got passed down.

929420,Acountdeleted,2015-08-13 22:50:00,2562,..... I think he is. Wait! No! He's 16 now.
929421,misfish,2015-08-13 22:57:00,29133,I have to say this  Both you and Chris and Brian ( that bear guy ) are what we need as MNR Officers.
929427,Acountdeleted,2015-08-14 00:36:00,2562,Thank you. That actually means a lot. I agree with Chris and Brian. I could do alright I guess.
929430,Rod Caster,2015-08-14 01:09:00,5784,I suggest you add OFC as a reference
929458,grizzlybri,2015-08-14 12:01:00,565,"I have to say this  Both you and Chris and Brian ( that bear guy ) are what we need as MNR Officers.  Hi Brian the bear guy here, thanks for the kind words. I'll have to check out the posting later today, just don't have that much time right now becuase I'm just starting work for the day.   On another note yes I'm still alive, just the summer has been very busy."

The Ontario Waste Diversion Act was implemented in 2002 which outlined responsibilities for corporations that generate packaging and hazardous waste. Since that point Manitoba, SK, and BC have all implemented similar regulations.  Little known to most people, your municipalities recycling and hazardous material collection programs are paid for by the companies that generate the products and packaging.  I.e. Coca cola pays for the cost to recycle one of their cans.  My job is to enforce this law...i investigate, enforce and Audit the companies and ensure that they meet the requirements of these regulations on a National Scale. This includes the generation of legal documents and serving notices to companies of their failure to comply...  I also like to fish and be outdoors a little bit"

929279,manitoubass2,2015-08-13 02:34:00,11391,Whats MNR pay COs anyhow?  Seems like a might dangerous job.  No way would I want to confront a group od illegal hunters armed to the teeth out in the middle of nowhere

No way would I want to confront a group od illegal hunters armed to the teeth out in the middle of nowhere  $1,300 to $1,450 per week as per the link.  Probably not too dangerous.  It may be similar to police work which is statistically safer than many factory/manufacturing jobs."
929291,manitoubass2,2015-08-13 03:28:00,11391,The pay is purdy crappie lol  Stastically millions work factory jobs and I think Ontario has like 12 Cos??? Hahaha  Ill take working at the mines and fishing for the peace of mind  Good luck to those that apply?
929293,Freshtrax,2015-08-13 03:36:00,2215,I'm just tired of sales and need a change of pace it would be a pay cut  but it would be nice to make a difference too.
929297,leaf4,2015-08-13 03:45:00,2466,"That pay would also include a pension and benefits would it not?  And I don't know how 1300-1450 a week is crappie haha, I clear 900 on 40 hours and I can live comfortably as a 25 year old with a paid off house and renters, when I get my ticket I'll be in that bracket and I'd be pretty pleased with that per week, but that's just me"
929298,manitoubass2,2015-08-13 03:50:00,11391,"I have 20 kids???  And i was joking, its not bad pay but net is only gonna be like $1000.  good on you for being a young guy and having your house payed off???"
929300,John Bacon,2015-08-13 04:30:00,3277,"Stastically millions work factory jobs and I think Ontario has like 12 Cos??? Hahaha   That is factored in to the stats.  In terms of deaths per man/hour, police work is not a particularilly dangerous job.  There are too few COs to compile meaningful stats.  But, I figured that COPs are the closest thing that I could compare them too."
929301,manitoubass2,2015-08-13 04:46:00,11391,"Im just havin fun bud?  I wouldnt wanna be a cop/co but cuddos to those that are, or wanna be."
929314,Acountdeleted,2015-08-13 11:43:00,2562,"Geez, this is bad pay to you guys? I'm happy if I clear $600 a week.  Simon, that's good advice. I'm off to the barber before this interview."
929322,porkpie,2015-08-13 12:37:00,2521,It's average to decent pay for a ministry enforcement job.  Good luck.
929324,AKRISONER,2015-08-13 12:42:00,5558,"even if its a pay cut, living is cheaper up north in comparison to the GTA or my scenario down town Toronto. Plus you spend your days cruising the wilderness for poachers...any job where i get to be outside like that would be worth while, plus im capable of pushing paper if need be.  Full pension is also a big deal, not too many jobs left offering that."

No way would I want to confront a group od illegal hunters armed to the teeth out in the middle of nowhere  That reminds me of the CO that was (he's retired now) in the Matachewan area. He was a real ball buster, that got himself tied to a tree, out in the bush and left there by a group of American hunters. The story goes that he was there for 2 days before he was found by the cops. I know a story is a story; but I had a run in with this CO and like I said a real ball buster, on a power trip and I can believe how it could have happened.  Dan."
