929037,kickingfrog,2015-08-11 22:17:00,8333,In an effort to reduce the amount of water loss to evaporation California has resorted to this.  Millions of plastic balls are dumped into a reservoir.    more info:  http://gizmodo.com/la-dumps-millions-of-plastic-balls-in-city-reservoir-to-1723433243
929046,leaf4,2015-08-11 22:46:00,2466,"Interesting, though that much $$$ for an extra 8100 in a city of how many is a high dollar per person"
929049,manitoubass2,2015-08-11 23:10:00,11391,What the????
929055,kickingfrog,2015-08-11 23:39:00,8333,What the????  California has a higher population than Canada but only about the same amount of water as I like in my drinks.
929061,manitoubass2,2015-08-11 23:51:00,11391,Oh I know but it seems like such an odd strategy.  Some weird science thats for sure
929139,cram,2015-08-12 13:08:00,1733,Neat idea.  I wonder why they used black balls (which are going to collect a lot of heat) instead of a lighter colour.
929149,John Bacon,2015-08-12 14:01:00,3277,Neat idea.  I wonder why they used black balls (which are going to collect a lot of heat) instead of a lighter colour.  I wondered that too.  They did mention that they also prevent algae growth and sunlight reacting with chlorine.  Perhaps the black works better for those issues.
929179,cram,2015-08-12 16:01:00,1733, I wondered that too.  They did mention that they also prevent algae growth and sunlight reacting with chlorine.  Perhaps the black works better for those issues.  Maybe white balls let light through.
929181,DanD,2015-08-12 16:06:00,2223,"Black balls, white ball who knows; as long as it's not blue balls.  Dan."
929190,Spiel,2015-08-12 16:34:00,9065,Neat idea.  I wonder why they used black balls (which are going to collect a lot of heat) instead of a lighter colour.  Exactly what I thought as soon as I saw them.
929224,netminder,2015-08-12 19:49:00,514,California is a disaster waiting to happen - if it hasn't already started. Just shows how desperate they are.
929227,Cast-Away,2015-08-12 20:16:00,790,What scares me the most is that California provides so much fruit and produce for the rest of North America. What would we all do if the farming industry collapsed?
929240,kickingfrog,2015-08-12 21:33:00,8333,"I think black would block out the sun's rays better, but either way, I don't think heat is as much of a concern as evaporation."
929242,manitoubass2,2015-08-12 21:46:00,11391,"We dont need fruit, we need actual farming.  California might get screwed either way. But we will be fine IMO"
929243,manitoubass2,2015-08-12 21:48:00,11391,The heat generated by black may cause more evaporation?  Thats why this puzzles me
929253,Tybo,2015-08-12 23:27:00,1373,"The black would prevent the sun  rays penetrating deeper into the water so there would be less heat. Like a granite lake in summer.Nice and warm on top,4ft down is freezing cold."
929257,Dozer,2015-08-13 00:12:00,896,I think its curbing evaporation along with shading.  Water draws in heat so perhaps the balls mitigate too much heat input therfore decreasing evaporation?
929262,glen,2015-08-13 00:48:00,2641,They look like they won't hurt my prop.  Some fish would like the shade too. Thanks Rob neat info.
