928739,CRUD150,2015-08-10 18:39:00,87,My good fishing buddy was able to land a great 16.64lb rainbow in the Chantry derby. He won a RSG custom reel and a custom rod. We are just wondering what the value of this package might be. I suggested that he may want to schedule this on his home insurance. Thanks in advance for your comments. 
928740,blaque,2015-08-10 18:42:00,2419,$200 at its highest........does he want to sell  Which model RSG is it?
928741,misfish,2015-08-10 18:50:00,29133,"$200 at its highest........does he want to sell  Which model RSG is it?  WOW You better sell now, you wont get a better offer.  Nice prize. And fish too."

That package is probably close to 2k (Depending on the rod)   The reel itself is well over $1000.
928750,solopaddler,2015-08-10 19:17:00,8605," The reel itself is well over $1000.  For sure, probably $1400 anyway.  My guess on both would be $2200.  Nice prize, congrat's!"

Yup, buddy got the orange one. And yes, I understand it is a mooching reel. Thought it would value about the same as a custom float reel by RonSG. Do you have any info on the 13' rod that came with it?"

I find 10 1/2  long enough in a boat, especially alone."

929412,misfish,2015-08-13 22:11:00,29133,"What's the difference between a centrepin and a mooching reel?  I will give an answer, but Im sure my expertice will be upstaged.LOL  The mooch is built for rigger fishing. It,s got a drag system, although it will smack your knuckles if your not use to them.  Pin is free spin although some do have a drag, but not sure if they are the same as the mooch.  Also line capacity is much more on the mooch then the pin as it,s a wider body.  Im just comparing my old ABU mooch compared to my newer pins G.  Im sure you can get a better def from others.  Edit to add, I use my pin for rigger fishing and still have my knuckles."
929419,Gerritt,2015-08-13 22:44:00,6129,Lol thanks Brian! Appreciated!  G
