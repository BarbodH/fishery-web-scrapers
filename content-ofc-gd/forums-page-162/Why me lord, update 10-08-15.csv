Being layed back is not my fortie, but it seems to be growing on me.  it didnt take long  for the results. He scanned the eye and all I could hear him keep saying was, nice, very nice, then it was,,,,,,,,,, Well, looks like you got lucky and your recovery is 96% of what sight you had after the cateract surgery. That Dr.Kurtis did a great job with the laser surgery.  I was told to take things at a even pace. No over doing it. You dont want to be going through this again.  I,ll see you in two months.  I only had one question after that. Hey doc. Can I go back to swinging the fishing rods?  YES  Great news. And to just make it final, I went down to the rocks after I left his office and threw the spinner bait for a half hour. Just cuz I could. I put the rod in the truck just incase.LOL  Thanks again all for your well wishes and thoughts.  "

Monday was a no go for the final proceedure, but the bit of fluid left still put it off til this morning. This was the most painful part of the whole proceedure. Im am very happy to say I have full ( as full as can be expected after this) vision. It,s still cloudy, but Im happy with the results so far. There is still the healling process. No heavy lifting,  pushing,or pulling. A fews weeks required to let things get to norm, I hope, to beable to get back to light duties at work for a week or two after my rest, but also get back out there doing some fishing.  Thanks to all of you that posted here and your PM,s to re ensure the hope. Also a great big thank you to the docs that got me back my sight. Theses guys are unbeleivable.Back down next thursday for a check up, then it,s local visits with my own doc every two weeks for a couple of months.  This is something I dont want to do again. It,s very consuming on the body and mind.  Thanks again  B  PS  The trips down and back allowed me to see my fuel consumption per km.  9.2 lt per 100 km  Not bad"

922877,Sterling,2015-07-02 16:27:00,477,"I know all about this. You'll be fine!  For most people retinal detachment occurs in one eye, then the other. If you're unlucky, it happens in both eyes at once and you risk losing sight in both eyes.  Looks like you caught it early. They can probably repair it or mend the detachment and prevent any further loss. Your other eye will be monitored closely to ensure you don't lose sight in that one.  Unfortunately you won't get to do any sports that involve the slightest impact, including golf. Luckily there's little impact in fishing ."

924133,misfish,2015-07-10 12:16:00,29133,"Woke up to a frightening 3/4 black eye. All I could see from was the top right section and even then it was in and out. Rushed to RVH ( NOT VERY PLEASED WITH THEM, BUT THATS ANOTHER STORY) I arrived at 5:30 am. It wasnt til 9 am I was looked at. By then, the eye was pretty much black. The doc took no time in getting on the phone and getting a specilist for me. ( Mine was on holidays) 1/2 hour later, Im on my way to Sunny brook for eye surgery. After about 2 hours of lasering 4 tares and putting some gas in the back of the eye, I was headed back home. Back down Saturday for round two. The doc has given me a 60/40 chance. I can see light today and make out shapes. I guess thats a positive. It,s the rest of the healing that will determine what sight range I will get. I,ll take some over none, but it is what it is.  The story about RVH.  I arrive and Im the only one in emgerg. Lady asks the norm whats wrong. I give her the whole speech about the warning sign if I got it and how it was very important that I get looked at right away. First she cant log into the computer. She tried for like 15 minutes. I stay cool as I know getting upset would not help. Finally get me in the system, get me in a room. 6am. Now I wait and wait. I ask when I will be seen. soon sir. Well soon was 9am. When I told the doc about the whole thing, he was not happy at all. Im not sure if or to whom I should make a complaint to. Maybe this is the norm for the hospital. All I know is when I got to sunny brook, I went to the deck and they had me in right away.  I will let my eye specilist know what happen and my family doc. Im sure they can get their point accross better then I. ( I do understand though that rushing me in may of had no help as it had come on fast)  So here I sit  waiting for the next step saturday. Im not sure what it is, but Im not really pissed anymore. These things happen. ( Like my brother says, what ya going to do) I still dont like it,but I will deal with it.Like I have a choice. LOL Work has told me to take all the time I need and if they can do anything, just let them know. I will be taking the docs rules to the T. Looks like fishing will be a few weeks away or more.  Thats it for now.  Have a great weekend ya,ll."

922592,misfish,2015-06-30 22:42:00,29133,"I know I have not been your greatest son, but why?   At the age of 4 I was told I would need glasses for a long time.  I lived with them my whole young life. Into my teens and  adult hood until a month ago.  Back track now,,,,,,,,,,One day I am told I have cataracts starting and glaucoma in my left eye at age 45. The glaucoma scared the crap out of me. Not being able to see in the near future, was not a nice thing to think about. Taking drops everyday.  Dealing with all this eye sight stuff, I always wished I didnt have glasses, and wondered what it would be like to be without them. If I took my glasses off, I couldnt see the end of my nose.  Last month, 6 years later, 47 years after my first pair of glasses,,,,,,,,,,  Im told I will require cataract surgery. Playing with my eyes put some fear in me, but knowing a member here who went through it, put me at ease some what.  Surgery of the first eye came mid May. The next was to be in early June. I have the first one done and right away I am at awe. This was my bad eye. Probly blind at best with it. The next day, I was able to see as far as BBP from the Barrie shoreline. I was so stoked, I couldnt wait for the next eye to be corrected. The day came for the second eye to be done and I couldnt wait. I was even 2 hours early hopeing to get ahead of others, but that dosent happen.LOL  I get the second eye done and I cant believe my eyes. I can see as good as if I had glasses on. Im on cloud nine and my first thought was, need to get me some cool shades. That I did right away.  It,s been a month now and I was enjoying the no need for glasses.On top of the world. That was til yesterday morning.  Nothing out of the norm this day. I was working away reparing a machine and I get this dark shawdow then these huge black floaters in the my left eye. It was like having a fly getting in your eye, but there were no flys around. I shake my head, rub my eyes and it,s still there. Now Im in what the ,,,,,,,,mode. Tell my fellow worker and he says to give my doc a call now. I do and told to get in right away.  I arrive and he has me in on the spot. Quick scan and in go the drops. Another scan mor drops and then he puts on this helmet cam thing. Ok, this aint good I think to myself.  After a few minutes, Im told that the retina is starting to detach from my left eye. He goes on telling me If I see a black wall forming up or across from the right of  my eye, I need to get to the ER asap. theres a comforting feeling.  I was like man, I was so happy with my new peeps. Now I have to deal with this.  I know there is much worse health issues out there, but I was on such a high.  Im pissed yes, but I know I still have a beating heart.  This might just be though, the sign to slow me down and relax and put me first for a change. Even if Im only 51, I can deal with that.  There, I got that off my chest.  Oh, I dont blame you lord, I probly deserved it some where along the line.  "
922595,spincast,2015-06-30 22:50:00,3279,"Wow, that would be tough after getting so close to a cure after so long B. Take it easy and listen to the Dr - its amazing what they can fix these days. It'll all work out - you got lots of good Karma on your side. Sayin' a couple for ya in our house."
922598,npt1,2015-06-30 23:04:00,220,"Brian, With the eye surgery and methods of treatment we have today, they can repair just about anything regarding vision. My wife has gone through two cataract surgeries and glaucoma treatment. She takes her drops every night, its a ritual. Her specialist told her years ago to buy the best quality sunglasses that are available, also to wear them even when its cloudy. My wife also volunteers at the Grimsby hospital and she has a friend there that has had both retina's detach at different times, had surgery and she is non the worse for it, she is doing really well. Everything will work out ."

I had a metal fragment removed from my eye earlier this year, and as the guy came towards me with the vibrating needle, I said ""You are going to do WHAT with that???"""
922607,okumasheffield,2015-06-30 23:42:00,318,Not sure if knowing about my situation would make you feel any better but here I come.  I am 38 and was told by my eye doc 6 months ago that he discovered signs of early retina detachment on my left eye.  Went to see a great specialist in Toronto Western who told me it is not a big deal that couple quick laser patching would do it.  Went back for follow-up last week and was told that the same sign was found on my right eye now ...  Doc assured me that everything will be fine but you know ...
922608,Andy,2015-06-30 23:45:00,330,"I'm sorry to hear that too, and I sure hope things work out for ya. I'm not a religious guy, but I do believe that we all have crosses to bear. It's just that some are just much heavier than others. I used to be a big plan ahead kind of guy. You know, save for retirement, life insurance, RRSPs, etc. I still take care of that stuff to some degree, but more and more I find myself trying to make the most of every day as it happens. Life is just to unpredictable to pretend that anything in the future can be set in stone."
922610,Old Ironmaker,2015-07-01 00:07:00,8243,"I am very sorry to hear that. Yes there is always someone worse off but that is tough to come to terms with when we are talking about loved ones close to us and ourselves, it's just human nature. I have been blessed with better than 20/20, still to this day I occasionally need cheaters depending how my blood glucose levels are. My Dr. says I am her only patient that is on Insulin that doesn't need glasses at 60. I am blessed and appreciate it. My Noni went blind but that was over 35 years ago. They have come a long way in medicine and can actually cure some blind people today. What they can do know with eyes is amazing. My kid brother has worn glasses since he was 5 and had that Lasik surgery and doesn't wear them today, and that was about 20 years ago.  You will be fine bud, I just know it."
922622,livinisfishin,2015-07-01 00:50:00,661,"Im 29 had an operation about 3 years ago for a retinal detachment. Mine was from  a punch in the face when I was 17. Didn't know anything was wrong for about 8 or 9 years, other then a few floaters here and there. It was the peripheral vision loss that made me go and get checked out. My eye sight will never be the same and for the last year ive been going down to the city once a month to get checked out to try and correct some central vision problems. I was fishing while recovering from the surgery after about a week and a half. Couldn't do any thing physically demanding for a while. Feel free to PM me if you want some first hand experience.  Editing to add some encouragement because that was a pretty negative post, my vision in the operated eye was decent for a couple years after its just been the last year that has been kind of crappy, I did have to get used to a new prescription in my eye after the surgery but it was manageable and my vision loss hasn't gotten any worse."

922646,bigugli,2015-07-01 02:23:00,6138,"Chin up Brian.  Detached retinas are more common than you would think. I've known a few folks have similar problems, and all were scared. All have undergone successsful corrective procedures of one type or another, and have been fine since. I'm sure you will be able to enjoy the same level of successful treatment."

922662,Moosebunk,2015-07-01 04:11:00,3970,"Anything nasty eye related gives me the old heebie-jeebies bud.  Don't slow down though... ever.  Follow Doc advice and get'em worked on again if need be.  As they've said above, it's amazing what can be done nowadays for the eyes.  You'll keep float tubing where ya wanna be and not unknowingly kicking yourself into the deep blue.  lol"
922675,lew,2015-07-01 10:09:00,12766,I can only imagine how scary that can be Brian but we've got some fantastic doctors in Ontario and they'll get you fixed up in no time.
922677,Big Cliff,2015-07-01 10:39:00,6899,"Hang in there my friend, lots of help and support available as you already know!"
922679,The Urban Fisherman,2015-07-01 10:48:00,2050,Damn Bri... half way through I was trying to figure out why your title was so negative.. hah Honestly thought I'm hoping for the best for you man! Take care and best of luck all around!
922694,Roe Bag,2015-07-01 12:38:00,246,"Lots of helpful information if you Google retinal tears/retinal detachment . I had cataract surgery on both eyes. Almost four years ago.Ten days apart. I too was amazed at the outcome. Colours came back to life. Improvement in my vision was unbelievable. About a year and a half ago I awoke with large floaters in my right eye. Diagnosis: Post retinal tear. Early stages of detached retina. Initially it seemed to heal itself and was monitored closely by my eye surgeon. He was convinced that the bleed had repaired itself and it was hoped that eventually the floaters would disperse. Didn't happen. Just before Christmas last year large dark floaters appeared in my left eye. Circumstances were such that my eye surgeon immediatelty refered me to the best in the business in Hamilton. He saw me the same day. Discovered that the right eye still had a minor bleed and the left eye had three tears. Resulting ina severe hemmorage. I underwent lazer surgery, on both eyes, the following day. I still contend with floaters. Over time they have become more and more transparent. Some lighting bothers me more than others. My vision for the most part is once again in excellent shape. This Doctor is renowned. If a trip to Hamilton is not out of the question, I would strongly recommend you see about a referal. Anyone in this and related fields knows of his work.  Send me a pm and I can give you his contact information..  As previously stated. Hang in there. Stay positive. Follow instructions to the letter. Good luck."

922726,Joey,2015-07-01 14:51:00,9122,"Jeez B, that sucks big time, sorry to hear that.  Hope it all works out for you bud!!"
922727,misfish,2015-07-01 14:56:00,29133,"Wow, it seems it,s not as uncommon as I thought.  Thanks everyone for the inspiring posts.  Im sure it will be fine. I have a very good eye specialist. DR. Emon. He is well known up here and has even corrected the sight of owner of the plant I work for. I have 100% trust in him.  I had a crappy sleep and was up at around 3am. So what does a fisherman do at that hour? Hit the water . I took my time loading the toon in. Was in no rush as it was drizzeling rain. Enjoyed a coffe and bagel just floating about for abit. Was on the water by 5. Just took it easy flipping my way around thankful for the morning. No sun rise, but I dont care.  As long as I can fish and enjoy, Im happy with that.  Drew, you made me laugh bud.  Rod in hand catching a few fish. Alls good.         Thanks again all, and happy Canada Day to you all."
922741,manitoubass2,2015-07-01 16:02:00,11391,Good to hear you'll get great treatment Brian. Another reason to love Canada!  Nice smalljaw and boy that perch hit a big tube! Cool!  Enjoy the water Brian?
922775,fishnsled,2015-07-01 18:48:00,3520,"The Lazer procedure that they will likely do is the same that I had for my eyes. Follow the pre-op instructions and get some Tylenol in you before you go. I won't lie to you, it's damn anoying. But better than the alternative. I had several procedures done on both eyes and things have been stable for a feature years now.  Hopefully they are addressing this soon.    All the best Brian, nice fish!"
