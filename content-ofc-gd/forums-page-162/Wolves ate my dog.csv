929566,manitoubass2,2015-08-14 22:15:00,11391,Lol.  Too busy defending against the ones here right now.  Sounds like we have a few encroaching the back yard last few nights.  Dogs are going nuts to be let go!
929568,cram,2015-08-14 22:23:00,1733,"Lol. Too busy defending against the ones here right now.  Sounds like we have a few encroaching the back yard last few nights.  Dogs are going nuts to be let go! They walk down the street in the middle of the day here.  Residential area.  They're pretty comfortable, to say the least."
929569,SirCranksalot,2015-08-14 22:32:00,3291,If you live in burbs and see a few 'missing kitty' posters you can be sure there are coyotes around!
929571,manitoubass2,2015-08-14 23:04:00,11391,"Wow thats pretty nuts!  They just pass through out here in the country, same with wolves, stay a few days and move on.  But GENERALLY they stay in the bush and not on our property"

929614,Moosebunk,2015-08-15 04:00:00,3970,Jeebus man!  The title wasn't kidding.  Sorry to hear.  That'd be a heckuva thing to find.
929038,Rod Caster,2015-08-11 22:24:00,5784,"You guys are great. Great sympathy, perspective and advice.  I'm cheap and will likely just post on kijiji for a free dog, as I did to get Buddy. Seems a lot of people get huskies in town and then realize they need a lot of space, which I have.  Why females MB? I would have thought males would be more protective and less attractive to other animals.  He ate raw meat his whole life. I raise and butcher rabbits so he gets lots of treats. Unfortunately he was the WORST hunting dog unless it was a chipmunk or porcupine hahaha."
929044,manitoubass2,2015-08-11 22:32:00,11391,"Honestly, all ive had is females, and they were all awesome dogs/hunters.  All the males ive met are more relaxed, although both need tons of excercise, i believe the females to be more fierce(just my experience)  Same with grandmas elk hounds, the females do the trick(but really maybe its just how they are raised??? Im not sure)  And yes, when you get a new buddy, keep up on the meat? makes a nice tough healthy dog"
929050,LostAnotherOne,2015-08-11 23:15:00,956,By the pics it looks like he had a pretty sweet life.  Sorry for your loss.
929057,Handlebarz,2015-08-11 23:44:00,3790,Dang very sorry to hear that. When I lived in Sudsbury they were getting back and doing just the same thing right in town
929081,Rod Caster,2015-08-12 01:08:00,5784,"Oh, and the MNR said I have legal right to shoot at the wolves (that are close to my house) given my situation, With a one-year old daughter who is learning to play outside a lot, I don't like the idea of bold wolves near the house. The wife is learning to use riffles...like it or not!"
929087,SirCranksalot,2015-08-12 01:40:00,3291,Do you know if they were wolves or coyotes or a hybrid?
929089,bigugli,2015-08-12 01:59:00,6138,So sorry to hear. It is one of the risks of living up north. The predators are always there.  And I  know you'll be second guessing what you could have done differently  to protect your friend.
929095,Old Ironmaker,2015-08-12 03:12:00,8243,"I am very sorry for your loss but that's nature.  There are always what I call ""Dogs that need a job"". Don't get a water dog unless you bring it out to work the water. Don't get a setter if you don't bring her out to a field. Don't get a Doberman if you don't want him to bark every time there is a noise outside. Get the right dog for the job.  There are many pups out there that are abandoned and would love you to be their Master. I haven't had one for years. We are in the country on the lake but  have neighbours from the cities that come out on weekends and the first thing they do is put up a freeking fence to cage the dog. I swear. I wan't my dog to run free that dogs should but don't want to have problems with my neighbours and I would want my dog to be a dog, not a caged pet. So Ticha has 2 cat's that brings home dead rabbits for me. And I cook them. She thinks I buy them.  Why should a cat be able to roam the neighbourhood but not a dog? Yes it isn't supposed to but it happens everywhere."
929100,Acountdeleted,2015-08-12 03:52:00,2562,"I wouldn't go seeking out a vengeance like other members had mentioned but to quote the great Willie Nelson:  'When sun's down, you'd better take care If I find you been creepin round my back stairs'"
929101,lunkerbasshunter,2015-08-12 03:52:00,2585,"Have family in North bay and heard wolves have been getting dogs there, sturgeon and south of nipissing.  Poor pouch.  Hang in there"
929113,Rod Caster,2015-08-12 11:41:00,5784,"Jeremie isn't that a Gordon light foot lyric??  Well, wolves should not be coming that close to the house, weve seen them on repeated occasions this year, even with us around. It's not a good pattern.  My dog was 100 free range and knew his boundaries amazingly well. Honestly, I agree that it was a known risk. Something I can manage maybe a bit better (like tying up when I hear packs, or shooting at them wen they are in my daughters play area), but nonetheless part of country life.  There was both hybrids and Timberwolves around. There are no legitimate coyotes here,  only eastern/coyote mixes and timbers. I heard both the timbers and the hybrids that night. Because the intact carcass was lifted and moved 100m without a trace, blood or fur, I assume it was a wolf because the hybrids could never have picked him up that cleanly, they are the same size as buddy approximately."
929114,Dontcryformejanhrdina,2015-08-12 11:43:00,535, Sorry to hear about your dog. Just terrible. Just remember that your dog had a better life than most. It experienced more joy in the time you had him than than he would have if he lived 18 years being crated every day and never allowed to run free. You actually allowed your dog to be a dog!
929116,Acountdeleted,2015-08-12 11:49:00,2562,"Ah. Chad you are correct. Good thing you know what I'm talking about. Half the time I don't know what I'm saying.  I'll be honest bud, this has been on my mind since the moment you posted it. I really hope you and the Missus are doing ok. Even just thinking about it makes my stomach uneasy.  Know that you are in all of our thoughts and we hope you can heal from this tragedy."
929122,Joey,2015-08-12 12:06:00,9122,"OMG, so sorry to hear this.  Hope it was quick at least.  I'm heartbroken for you"

929429,Rod Caster,2015-08-14 01:04:00,5784,"Bobcats and lynx' love housecats too. So I've heard. I find it a bit odd that my many rabbits (up to 24)  have been left alone by predators over the last 3 years.  Things are better, but still lots of reminders.  We've been offered a Great Pyrenees by someone. It's still a bit early, but this looks one hell of an outdoor dog."
929433,LostAnotherOne,2015-08-14 01:13:00,956,There was a place I worked in the past that had a Great Pyrenees that lived there.  Awesome dog.  Gentle giant I used to call him.  Head on him like a bull.

928931,AKRISONER,2015-08-11 12:39:00,5558,"ive been up at the cottage and heard the wolves trying to lure my pup out at night its terrifying, what a horrible way to lose a friend.  RIP"
928932,Rod Caster,2015-08-11 12:45:00,5784,"Yeah, Im sure he got in a few strikes, Huskies are quite the fighters. I've seen him embarass a bull mastiff before!  How are the malamutes compared to siberians as far as character?  They seem a little calmer but their size might come in handy around here."
928934,Ralph Field,2015-08-11 13:06:00,1018,"Wow that's horrible! Have heard of this happening a number of times over the years, it's always a risk. From one dog lover to another you guys have my sympathies. That's a tough way to lose a dog. x2"
928937,netminder,2015-08-11 13:14:00,514,That's horrifying... I was expecting to see a dog considerably smaller than the one you have the victim of this. I don't think I'd be able to handle this happening to me
928940,misfish,2015-08-11 13:24:00,29133,WOW that was not a good read Chad. Sorry dude.  I would be baiting and popping a few in buddys honor.
928941,manitoubass2,2015-08-11 13:26:00,11391,"Indeed get a malamute Chad. They are great hunters and super trainable, easy going dogs. They protect the property and family much more fearsly than a siberian.  My siberian will protect against animals but any stranger could walk right in and pet her.  Not my malamutes, they wait for an okay signal. If you walked in my house when im gone you better have a gun and good aim.  And for your property chad, two dogs are better than one.  Malamutes would have taken out the wolves no doubt in my mind."

928962,Cast-Away,2015-08-11 16:33:00,790,Very sad to hear Chad. I am surprised that they would come after a dog in the summer time when food should be so plentiful.
928964,manitoubass2,2015-08-11 16:40:00,11391,"My guess is the alpha was around.  Wolves get super aggressive at that time.  Just like chads dog would be proud to show a kill to him, thats hows the pack acts as well.  The wolves temperment totally changes, at least in my experience"
928976,Headhunter,2015-08-11 17:19:00,5703,"My wife's cousin has been breeding Mals for 25 years. To me, they are over-grown lap dogs! LOL Sure, they will pull a sled all day, but majority of them that I have met, are lazy and would prefer a good nap, to any kind of aggression. They may well be fighters, I just haven't experienced that. That all said, sorry for your loss and maybe a Mal is the right dog for you... size alone might detract from an attack. HH"
928977,manitoubass2,2015-08-11 17:30:00,11391," Take em huntin and fishing right as pups(or up to about 1 year old) and they are gnarly tough, but still super gentle at home. Awesome awesome dogs.  Also Chad, when your ready of course, get females  And let them eat meat, they wanna hunt. Let them hunt.  Feed em fish leftovers deer etc  A good husky is well fed, and eats meat  Be prepared though, remember my badger thread?  When I say they hunt I really mean that. My older girl eats skunks. To them, if it moves its fair game. She even eats lampreys"
928979,manitoubass2,2015-08-11 17:37:00,11391,Imo only other dog that compares is elk hounds
928982,bare foot wader,2015-08-11 18:04:00,1354,"Sorry for you loss, its never easy losing a pet, and it's even tougher to predators  Some domestic dogs stand a good chance against a pair of single coyote or eastern wolves, but very few, even the largest, stand much chance against a pack. A pet is a permanent attractant to your residence, he will constantly attract them unless they have learned the reward is not worth the risk. I find a 40 grain sleeping pill from my trusty old 222 to be quite effective, but there are many other options out there  if you want a real wolf dog, look into the various breeds of livestock guardian dogs, but working dogs are generally not great pets"
928983,manitoubass2,2015-08-11 18:12:00,11391,"I totally disagree. Your opinion and thats great( your allowed that lol)  Malamutes will kill wolves, even packs.  I know because ive watched it for 12 years.  Most wolves wont even approach them. More often its the husky that initiates, and finishes, the fight"
928985,bare foot wader,2015-08-11 18:31:00,1354,"you'll notice I said very few....  but if you watch your malamute fight wolves long enough, eventually his day his coming....just like watching two closely matched boxers, they both have winning and losing days"
928987,Beavertail,2015-08-11 18:54:00,331,"Not trying to de-rail this thread but...do you mean one dog taking out a whole Wolf pack at once?? If that's the case that IS one tough dog. I mean wolves live 365 days a year in the wild and hunt/kill daily. They take down Moose and even Bison out west, which is the largest land animal in North America."
929002,davey buoy,2015-08-11 20:25:00,5505,"Sorry chad for your loss as well,that sucks big time. Having said that two Cane Corsos one female and one male ,no worries I would think.Read up on them,not cheap,great pets and will never lose a fight.Your probably not ready yet,but the best dog of many that I have had.Loyal to the bone.!!!.Again so sorry ! Maybe not a great hunting dog."
929012,farsider,2015-08-11 20:43:00,456,What a horrible way to die.  Life lesson I guess.  Mark
929016,Flint1007,2015-08-11 20:59:00,2,My condolences man. No one should ever have to see their companion go in such a horrid manner
929026,manitoubass2,2015-08-11 21:45:00,11391," An individual dog stands no chance at a bigger pack of wolves. But they go after one and sometimes two and take them down, the rest leave. Here the packs are usually only 4 deep, maybe 6  Happens all the time up up here, its pretty much a normal occurance"
928858,Rod Caster,2015-08-11 01:16:00,5784,"Quite the brutal sight. ugh.  Lots of 'what ifs'...we should have tied him up when we heard the brush wolves (coyote/eastern wolf mix) howling. But I had no idea the bit Timberwolves were around, and clearly very hungry. Blood and fur all over my lawn in the morning. They literally ate him to the bone.  He's scrapped it out with single wolves and coyotes before and scared them off, but this time they had a clear and hungry agenda.  He was one hell of a property dog, tough as nails to other animals and super nice to all people. One of the risks of living in the bush and keeping an outdoor dog, I guess. Later Buddy.      "

My neighbour told me he saw a dozen on the ice there this past winter. Every time he goes off exploring I worry. Usually he just walks up to the neighbours cabin 300 yards away but he has gone close to a mile around the bay before.
928874,KraTToR,2015-08-11 01:57:00,506,"From the pictures I believe I see a yellow lab.  Fiercely loyal and amazing companion.  Smart as heck, strong as an ox yet gentle.  I've known many..  May he always be in your thoughts as he was doing his duty by protecting what meant most to him.  And he died a good death.  Brave and strong protecting his family.  What was his name?"
928877,Walleye72,2015-08-11 02:05:00,156,Wow!!  That's terrible.  He looked like a beauty.   I hope you are feeling better soon.
