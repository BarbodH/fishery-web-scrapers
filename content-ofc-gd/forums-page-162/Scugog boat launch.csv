929167,KraTToR,2015-08-12 15:02:00,506,Planning on putting in at Scugog next week. Can anyone recommend the best value launch with parking?  I'll only be out for the day.  Thanks in advance!  
929169,EC1,2015-08-12 15:25:00,930,"Island Marina, Port Perry have very nice launches with a fee. Goreskis and West Shore Marina I don't know the details to. Caesarea is a good launch as well without a fee, but parking can be difficult on weekends. Weekdays shouldn't be a problem for the road side parking. Depends more on which side you'd want to be fishing - Running 20k in the boat to save the launch fees might not be worth it. Viewlake is an option if you've got a smaller boat."
929205,Sinker,2015-08-12 17:43:00,8692,It really depends where you want to fish. Isnt the launch in port perry free? Ive never used it myself as I fish the east side.  S.
929225,John Bacon,2015-08-12 19:56:00,3277,"I have used three different launches on Scugog.  I would rate Port Perry as the best of the three.  The launch is free but you pay to park.  It is a good quality launch with docks.  I have also used one at a Marina one the west shore of the island, Goreski?  Not quite as nice of a launch.  I also used a free launch on north end of the island.  It was free but had street parking only and you may not be able find parking if you do not get there early."
