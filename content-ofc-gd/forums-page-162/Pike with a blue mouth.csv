I tried to attach a pic but it's too big and I'm just on my phone, might upload it to photobucket later. Anybody ever see this in pike (or other fish) before or know why it's that colour? Everything else about it was normal and healthy looking."
929366,manitoubass2,2015-08-13 18:07:00,11391,Never seen or heard of that!  Ive caught one pike that was normal on one side and white on the other

929368,Acountdeleted,2015-08-13 18:14:00,2562,I know up north they have 'silver pike' it's just a different colour phase. May be similar with this as well. Like blue walleye.
929369,cram,2015-08-13 18:15:00,1733,Have seen lots of blue tinged walleye.  Apparently it's a pigment in their slime.   May be something similar?
929371,Dontcryformejanhrdina,2015-08-13 18:18:00,535,"It wasn't a silver pike, still had normal green sides with white spots. Wish I could link the photo."
929377,manitoubass2,2015-08-13 18:41:00,11391,Email it to me  [emailÂ protected]  Ill post it for ya?
929378,kickingfrog,2015-08-13 19:00:00,8333,"Sorry, my bad. I was using smurfs for bait.   Ya, it's the same blue algae that some walleye have."
929422,Gallie,2015-08-13 23:24:00,1215,I read somewhere that blue walleye were simply lacking a pigment in thier skin that normally produces thier golden colour. It was a minor genetic mutation.
929434,Rizzo,2015-08-14 01:18:00,4754,"yes, I have caught a blue-tinged pike before too"
929470,AKRISONER,2015-08-14 13:33:00,5558,"we catch these fish all the time, ive seen both pickerel and pike with this colouration, check this 40 incher my pops caught this spring with a blue face  "
929501,Dontcryformejanhrdina,2015-08-14 15:59:00,535,"Tried emailing it to you, not sure if it went through. Damn phone."
929503,manitoubass2,2015-08-14 16:17:00,11391,Yeah I got it. Ill post it up soon?
929505,manitoubass2,2015-08-14 16:27:00,11391,    Gotta say that mouth looks awesome! Neat!
929507,manitoubass2,2015-08-14 16:34:00,11391,And that net reminds me of fishing 25 years ago???
929512,DOS,2015-08-14 17:08:00,119,he has been eating grape popsicles like my kids...LOL
929515,dave524,2015-08-14 17:25:00,4508,"I've caught Bowfins that had a green tongue, never a pike."
929535,mitch seguin,2015-08-14 19:18:00,98,There were a few Timmins back lakes where 'blue' pike could be had.  My young lads at the time thought they were 'cool'.
929536,cram,2015-08-14 19:33:00,1733,That looks different from the blue walleye i've caught. Maybe just how it's expressed on a pike
