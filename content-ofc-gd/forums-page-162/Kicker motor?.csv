928788,SlowPoke,2015-08-10 20:35:00,2984,"If you're considering a kicker, don't waste your time with a small HP. Noisy single cyl drink mixers with above water exhaust and not enough power to handle even a light wind. No too mention, as an auxillery (emergency) motor...almost better paddling. Do it right with an 8 or 9.9 high thrust minimum 4-stroke for walleye/salmon/trout. Musky guys would benefit from 15-20hp for speeds 4mph and up."
928831,irishfield,2015-08-10 22:43:00,26272,ummm if a 9.9 can push my Baron at 5.8MPH... but then again I don't care to listen to it so just troll Muskie with the Verado in silence.
928840,SlowPoke,2015-08-10 23:09:00,2984,ummm if a 9.9 can push my Baron at 5.8MPH... but then again I don't care to listen to it so just troll Muskie with the Verado in silence. I never said it wouldn't do musky trolling speed but you're not doing yourself any favours running a kicker balls out to hit 5mph when the main motor can do it just above idle. My high thrust 9.9 will do over 5 but I don't think it will hit 6 and at that rate probably using my fuel than my main motor!

929120,KraTToR,2015-08-12 12:01:00,506,"The biggest kicker i've seen is a 15hp and this was on a 21' multi-species boat.  Something about running the power steering on a big Verado..  I use a 9.9 Pro Kicker on my 17.5' Larson and it trolls 3mph at less than 1/2 throttle, close to 5mph at full.  In the odd case that I may need to troll faster or if the wind is really up, I just use the main."
929172,Old Ironmaker,2015-08-12 15:28:00,8243,I know a 9.9 Merc 2 stroke and a 15 Merc 2 stroke are the exact same engine and wt. with a larger carb on the 15. I know the 20 is heavier because I have to mount both on the boys boats in the spring.
929593,musky666,2015-08-15 01:56:00,126,"Spent the day on the water today with the new kicker- 20 hp four stroke Suzuki with fuel injection and lean burn. Worked flawlessly, but yes, surprisingly noisier and more vibration than the 225 main motor. Started the day with a full tank of fuel and only needed $19 to fill her up after an 8 hour day with probably 6 hours of trolling/ idling on the kicker, and 40 minutes or less in main motor- very impressed with low fuel consumption as well as the hours I saved on the main motor. Seems to max out about 6.5 mph, and will troll below 1 mph, although ran around the 3.5 mark most of the time, for Musky."
929607,leaf4,2015-08-15 03:08:00,2466,Some nice savings there for sure. Glad it worked out for you!
929633,duke01,2015-08-15 14:25:00,20,"Our old boat was a 17 ft Sylvan with a 115 Johnson on it and we never needed the kicker. When we went to the 20 ft Crestliner with the 300 Merc we put a 9.9 Merc Pro Kicker on it. The thing is louder than our 300 and much fussy to start. However, you can adjust speed and save on fuel nicely. If you are doing long off shore trips on the Great Lakes i believe it is an important safety tool in case of main engine problems."
929639,BillM,2015-08-15 14:58:00,17367,"My T8 High thrust Yami is definitely louder then the 115 main.  But she sips fuel, I can deal with the extra noise."
929640,davey buoy,2015-08-15 14:59:00,5505,"That's why I bought a electric for a couple reasons. Moving around,and let me get to shore in case a problem with the main.Maybe not 8 miles or more out in rough conditions."

927796,Sinker,2015-08-05 01:41:00,8692,"What size is your main, and how big is your boat? How much do you troll?  Lots of variables, but in most cases a kicker has more pros than cons.  S."

927813,BillM,2015-08-05 02:54:00,17367,I like knowing that I've got another way back home if the main dies.  Plus it keeps the hours off the big motor when trolling the big lake...
927834,wormdunker,2015-08-05 10:03:00,1711,Most bigger motors (not all) will not slow down enough to troll.  That's one of the reasons guys use a kicker.  My 20 hp Yammy 4 stroke on my 14' Lund will only slow down to 2.4 mph.  For walleye on Erie ideal trolling speed is 1.5 - 2 mph.  Also I have been advised trolling with a bigger motor is hard on the engine.  As stated above it's nice to know you have a back up engine to get you back to the launch if your big motor should fail.
927837,G.mech,2015-08-05 10:37:00,830,"I put a 4HP 4 Stroke on my Princecraft 176 for backup and to save hours on the 115.  I didn't want to go too big to keep the weight down so I thought this was the answer.  Although it works fine and will push the boat at 6 mph, I wish I had gone larger just to keep the RPM's down since it is actually noisier and vibrates more than the 115 when trolling so I often end up running the 115 anyway.  A speed control (such as trollmaster or iTroll) is very nice to fine tune the speed and a high thrust prop is essential to push a larger boat at low speeds."

927846,doubleheader,2015-08-05 12:07:00,497,"A kicker is a good investment if your style of fishing is trolling at 1 mph and above, or, if you fish waters where a 2nd motor is simply a good idea from a safety perspective. I typically use my electric motor up to 1.2 mph, then my kicker to troll above those speeds. Consider a 2 cylinder 4 stroke, it will run with much less vibration than a single."
927853,KraTToR,2015-08-05 12:58:00,506,"I am considering adding a kicker motor to my rig- save hours on big motor, and better speed control for trolling. What do folks with kickers say- is it a worthwhile investment? Do you actually use the kickers to troll instead of the big motor? I went through the entire kicker process this year.  Except for Muskie trolling, my main is too fast and I don't really like the idea of idling a 150 for hours on end.  I wanted a remote setup but went with the tiller handle because of the cost to rig the remote. Installed it myself, there's a vid on U-Tube that shows the best placement. Bought a cheap tiller ext. handle, upgraded it to the longer helmsmate with the U-Joint which works very well. Still found it hard to control so I started using my bow mount minn kota to steer and I locked in the kicker steering - this works very well but it does deplete the batteries which may not be desirable depending on your situation. Recently added a steering rod (Panther) between the main and the kicker and this works very well.  I still leave the minn kota deployed in case I need it and I use it for the built in sonar - I use a split screen between the bow and stern sonar which helps with steering if you're following a weed line or drop off.  With that being said, I use the kicker a lot.  It sips fuel and as others said, its a backup to get your a$$ home if the main fails.  I plan on adding a planer board mast this fall for further benefit and of course it you have or plan to have down riggers, its a no brain-er.  It would be nice to know what you're boat setup is.  Good luck and PM me if you have any specific questions."
927910,JoePa,2015-08-05 16:04:00,179,Kicker motor - by all means - reasons include having a backup motor in case you have trouble with the main motor - uses less gas - a lot quieter - slower trolling speed - I have a 5 hp Merc 4 stroke and really like it - I have a 12 gal gas container just for the kicker and the extra gas often comes in handy - I have the extra hoses so I can use the gas container for my main motor if needed -  I would never feel safe going out onto a big lake without a backup motor - I have a '91 Bass Tracker 17 ft deep V with a 40 hp main motor -

I mainly fish for Ski so actually run motor at about 850/900 rpm when trolling for them ( which is often) Considering a 20 hp 4 stroke Zuke for the kicker- should troll down enough ( pushing big boat after all) for 'Eyes, but still crank it up for Ski speeds and if I needed her to get back to ramp in emergency.

928168,scugpg,2015-08-06 21:21:00,1373,20 might be lumpier while than the 9.9 as bigger twin cylinders.  9.9 would also be lighter.
928289,fishnsled,2015-08-07 17:08:00,3520,"I'd say the 9.9 will be more than enough for that boat.  If guys are pushing much larger boats on the big water with them, you'll be fine.  The weight of the 20 maybe a concern for that transom, but maybe not.  A few other things to consider I found on a Google search.  There is a great deal to consider when selecting an auxiliary motor. The horsepower of the motor is just one element. Other factors to consider: --weight of motor--size of motor--shaft length--battery charging capability--compatibility with steering gear and linkage to main motor--compatibility with remote control system in place on boat--compatibility with fuel system and type of fuel needed, particularly if pre-mixed oil-fuel is used on main motor."

928329,Old Ironmaker,2015-08-07 22:35:00,8243,"I concur a 20 horse is overkill. A 9.9 is plenty for a 20 foot aluminum. I nabbed a 15 in January 2014 that matched my main by year and make, same graphic and elec. start and throttle/shifter for a steal of a price. The very first time I used it last year the battery died on my boat but there was just enough to crank the 15. It brought us back to the dock from 10 miles out in Erie from the Long Point Elbow to Nanticoke Creek if anyone is familiar. I use it to troll now exclusively and watch my amp meter on the combo closely. I will not leave the slip without it now, or my booster pack. I figure it saves me around 20, 25 bucks in fuel and oil in a day trolling. I used the big motor to troll for 6 years but would have to pull all the lines and give it a run every 45 minutes to cool the 115 and decarbonize it. That was a pain, a good pain because fishing isn't painful really, no complaints here.  I have been out trolling for around 100 hours this year and last and have used maybe 10 litres or so of gas including that 10 mile creep along last year. A kicker is a no brainer on big water.  A side note, we do complain about fishing, no fish, bad weather, snags, cost, all sorts of complaints. But there are worse things, many worse things in life, we have to keep it real, right?"
