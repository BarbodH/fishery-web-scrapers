926550,mherak,2015-07-28 23:10:00,4,So I've never fished the grand before but hear it can hold some really nice browns. From what I've read online the Fergus Elora area is my best bet to hooking up with some of them. Has anyone been there recently? How's the population doing? Any recommendations on flies or other areas of the grand?

926588,Musky or Specks,2015-07-29 11:40:00,2710,"2 post ,intro , gimme gimmie gimmie. I ask once again for a sticky post regarding First post.      (Pinned)BEFORE YOU POST ON OFC FOR THE FIRST TIME PLEASE READ THIS.  We are not in the habit here of just telling strangers where to fish. That said we are a helpful group to those who wish to become part of our community. For your first post we recommend an Intro telling us a bit about yourself and your passion for the sport of fishing. Your Username ,how you fell in love with fishing, maybe the best fishing experience you can remember(fish pics help). You will find if you take the time to do this, members here will take the time to point you in the right direction. The longer you are a member and the more active you are will generally lead to some very specific answers via PM.  Sincerely  Long Time OFC Members      Could we get a mod to sticky that."

If someoene is going to show up and bloodsucker for spots to fish, having to make an intro isn't going to stop them.  It's a pointless endeavour.  Just don't bother feeding them info, and they'll either stay and contribute, or they'll go away.  Having a requirement to post an intro is one of the sillier things I've seen on forums."

Most recent example is Mr. Herak's thread. Shaming people into  introducing themselves is not conducive to building a strong (inclusive) community."

926600,Musky or Specks,2015-07-29 12:53:00,2710," I agree. Most recent example is Mr. Herak's thread. Shaming people into  introducing themselves is not conducive to building a strong (inclusive) community. Where did I say shaming? It is an introductory post to introduce yourself. And by placing it as a sticky it gives first time visitors a idea of what we expect. I suggest you make a visit to Reddit Roy and look at every sub-reddit which gives RULES sometime quite extensive before you can place a topic or post and if they are not followed the MODS remove the post. But if you don't place the rule or guideline  how are first time visitors to know. Get off your butt Mods and actually be proactive instead of just running things the way they have always been. What can it hurt to sticky(PIN) this Roy? Is it to much work to copy and paste my idea?How bout you discuss it with the site owner? Then when a newbie comes here (who may become a valuable member of this community(and I can think of several who started with a ""shaming"" first post) members can just ignore a first  post like this and mods can remove it.Instead right know I feel obligated to inform a first time poster how to get a good response so that we don't lose someone who may bring something to the table here at OFC."
926613,porkpie,2015-07-29 13:41:00,2521,I think Roy co-owns the site with a few others.  Could be wrong.

926625,netminder,2015-07-29 14:21:00,514,"I see people fishing the grand around Fergus and Elora pretty much every day. catch and release, singe barbless hook, artificial bait only. As to what exactly they're using, I couldn't tell you. not a fly fisherman."
926628,Spiel,2015-07-29 14:28:00,9065,I think Roy co-owns the site with a few others. Could be wrong.  You are correct.
926632,crappieperchhunter,2015-07-29 14:44:00,2582,"Through Fergus Elora used to be awesome for browns.  Might still be...I have not fished it for over 10 years, maybe 20. I grew up within walking distance of the river between Fergus and Belwood but moved away in 1982. They didn't stock the Browns until after I moved    Used to be areas that allowed live bait but most of it was artificial baits and barbless hooks...not sure about present day. Make sure you know the regs before you go."
926646,CRUD150,2015-07-29 16:54:00,87,"Some great replies. One, rather childish and whiny. Good luck on the Grand!"
926650,mherak,2015-07-29 17:16:00,4,Thank you all for the replies. Ill update you all when I head over there should be next week. Been way too hot I feel for anything good. I'm just gonna bring whatever hatch charts tell me is good for this time of the year and pray lol.  Will most likely try just under the Elora Gorge and then head up to the dam at Bellwood later in the day
926666,fishnsled,2015-07-29 19:15:00,3520,"There are a few shops up that way that maybe worth stopping in to see what is working and grab a few flies to support them.  There are also a couple of websites that have the river conditions and what hatches are going on.  Don't know them off of the top of my head but a Google search should point you in the right direction.  As Bill said, a guide can be well worth the money spent."
926667,manitoubass2,2015-07-29 19:18:00,11391,"Many members here expect introductions.  There was a thread not so long ago about the topic.  It helps if a new member introves themselves and maybe posts some older pics etc  Its not asking for alot.  I know I for one prefer it, but Im not gonna lose any sleep over it either.  Good luck chasing browns!"
926728,Old Ironmaker,2015-07-30 03:23:00,8243,"I believe giving a little bio as a first post is a great idea. I didn't here because I hadn't been on a fishing forum for years, almost 15 in fact. When I join a new forum regardless what ever the topic I give a little intro and it seems to be very well received. I don't think it's asking to much, if a new member doesn't do it well it's their choice, deleting posts because they didn't  is going too far though."

I can sympathize with that, but it's not forum policy. Nor is it communicated anywhere that an introduction is expected. If the site leaders expect/recommend an introduction, there's a few ways to ensure that happens;  1. The ""welcome to OFC"" email you receive when registering could include a link to pertinent resources for the site, including a link to an introduction thread, or forum. 2. The general forum could remain locked (for posting) until a post is made in the introduction thread/forum. 3. A sticky could explain that it's polite/expected to introduced oneself.  Those are just ideas by the way - by no means am I telling people how to run things. On my forums members have to read the ""site survival guide"" before proceeding and it works great. Introduces people to site functionality too.  As for Musky's initial response... there's always a more diplomatic method to express a valid message ."
926803,manitoubass2,2015-07-30 17:42:00,11391,"Oh for sure!  But its just awesome when someone says ""hey guys, look at my fish porn! Im so and so from so and so and lets get to making some friends on the board""!  If ya dont, no big deal.  But i prefer it. But im not gonna blast anyone for not doing it.  But if i have no idea who you are and you ask for techniques on the lakes I fish, im for less likely to respond"
926806,crappieperchhunter,2015-07-30 18:05:00,2582,Been on here a long time. I never posted an intro when I joined and to this day I have never posted a picture.  Guess I slid in under the radar somehow
926809,manitoubass2,2015-07-30 18:08:00,11391,Instant ban???
926819,mherak,2015-07-30 18:56:00,4,dam this got wild I was just curious about trout lol. I dont even see an intro sub forum. I only see General Discussion so I assumed intro threads weren't a normal thing to do. Sorry if I offended anyone lol wasn't my intention
926832,manitoubass2,2015-07-30 20:44:00,11391,"Thats the problem, you asked about trout????  Welcome aboard!"
929029,wildeye rainbow,2015-08-11 21:55:00,123,"just go to the Grand River Conservation Authority website and look at their online brochure.  A heads up, there are specific fishing regs on the Grand - read up on them too before you go.  WR"
929304,chrisdrumz,2015-08-13 06:24:00,2,went fly fishing below the dam at elora gorge with a couple buddies last weekend and three of us got skunked.. None of us had deep/heavy enough flies on in hindsight.. Gotta fish above the thousands of people drifting down in tubes though
