While out fishing this past Friday, I was fortunate to spot this one. It would fly 50 feet down the shoreline each time it spotted me, eventually settling in a spot for a shallow water stalk and stealth hunt.After taking a few dozen images, I set the camera to video in hopes of catching some action. The little bird didn't disappoint! Pretty impressive to watch how quickly and accurately it strikes - then manipulating the fish to swallow it whole.Rideau River, Merrickville - August 7, 2015(watch in 1080p HD for best quality)  Cheers, Justin "

929004,Brettiop,2015-08-11 20:27:00,279,That was wicked!  Well done getting that shot

929052,Beavertail,2015-08-11 23:21:00,331,Cool footage! You were in the right place at the right time. Amazing the patience Herons possess while waiting for a fish to swim by.
929069,Jds63,2015-08-12 00:12:00,1365,Very cool video !
929214,JustinHoffman,2015-08-12 18:30:00,482,"Beavertail - Once I took some still shots, then turned the camera to video, I began to wonder how long I might have to wait for it to strike prey - if it even decided to. Luckily, I only had to wait 2.5 minutes until it made the catch. Good thing - I can only shoot about 20 minutes before the battery dies! lol  Cheers, Justin"
929219,KraTToR,2015-08-12 19:15:00,506,"Holy Mackinaw!  What amazing footage. And the picture quality.. wowza.  What equipment do you use?  Also, you can probably remove the NF from your post's title...."
929220,JustinHoffman,2015-08-12 19:20:00,482,"KraTTor - Thanks! This was shot with a Canon 70D DSLR w/ a Sigma 150-500mm Telephoto lens - all on a tripod.  Haha! You're right - guess it is fishing after all! haha!  Cheers,  Justin"
