926360,Slayingm,2015-07-27 21:24:00,204,I had 2 guide trips on Balsam lake this weekend and like the weather the action was hot!  In fact on Sunday we boated 15 nice Walleye and lots of Smallies and a nice Pike. Sat. we also boated good numbers of Walleye and smallmouth.  The Walleye were all caught jigging grubs and minnow style plastics on deep weedlines throughout the lake.  Here is a typical Walleye one of my customers caught on Sunday.   On the Sat. trip I had 4 guys out and they all caught a few fish including this pig smallmouth that crushed a jerkbait.  We were catching our bass on tube jigs and jerkbaits in 4- 10ft of water with rocks and scattered weed clumps.   Aside from all the fish we caught the highlight for me was the gourmet lunch my customers brought in a monster cooler.... even ate on china plates!!   Stay safe and Good Fish'n.... Greg.

928895,joeybacala,2015-08-11 03:04:00,63,I too fished Balsam with the advice of a board member. First of all his info was very accurate and with that we had a lot of good fish too. I will say no walleyes but the smallies loved those crank baits.

929079,joeybacala,2015-08-12 00:51:00,63,We were fishing on a sunny day and found the bright colours worked pretty good. The retrieve wasn't too fast and focused in the 10-15FOW along weed edges.
