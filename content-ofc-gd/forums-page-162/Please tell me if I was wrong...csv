Years ago my buddy and I were walking along the sidewalk and this guy going the other way yelled at us for hogging the sidewalk. So my buddy yells back at him and we keep walking. Two minutes later that same guy catches up to us and apologizes. Says he has had the week from hell. We took him for a beer and let him tell us all about it. Super nice guy.

I think some people get really aggressive when a child is around because they know that the odds are that the adult will hold back.  Its kind of like the internet.  I think there are a lot of tough guys out there hding behing a keyboard (or behind a parent's kid).  Take the high road and use it as a learning opportunity for the kid to let hem know that hose kind of people are out there.  That said, I would leave any marker out there, especially if its on a shoal.  Those things are used to mark structure for future refence so they are ALWAYS left when the boat is not around."
929264,Old Ironmaker,2015-08-13 00:52:00,8243,"Thinking about it that thing could have been a hazard marker or marking a sunken vessel, snow machine or whatever. If I see a marker in the future I will leave it where I found it. It might be a structure marker which was the only thing on board to mark it with. I don't carry MT jugs onboard my boat but have a few orange markers. But the guys in the boat upsetting any youngster will still get a well placed flare between the eyes."

It is not a matter of you doing anything wrong (IMHO I don't think you did) but rather the stupidity of the verbal abuse that is questionable.  I find that as I grow older that the behaviour of a lot of people in public is , ""it's all about me and I'm gonna let you know it"", attitude.  Your story has been repeated countless of times in many different forms and it is now accepted as a norm.  Intimidation and entitlement to intimidation is common place.  Good on ya for setting a fine example for for your bud and his son and keeping your cool.  If you want to see this behaviour again watch the steelhead season go into full chaos in October. Your incident will look minor. The post ""Am I close enough"" as just another example as is yours of the me,me,me,me attitude.  You can't fix stupid.  muddler"

This is just one of the reasons I gave up all tournament fishing years ago. It's too serious and sucks the fun out of it and I was one of those sucking the fun out of it....now I REALLY enjoy fishing with the same partner as I fished tournaments with as he feels the same way. We laugh and have a good old time while even catching a fish or two

928764,KraTToR,2015-08-10 19:52:00,506,"Looking for some outside perspective on an indecent i experienced out on LSC yesterday.  I took out a bud and his 7 yr old son (who happens to be a fishing maniac!) on LSC yesterday in an attempt to boat their first Muskie.  It was very busy at the Belle River hump as it was day 2 of a Muskie Tournament.  During the late afternoon, after most of the boats had left for the day, we were trolling along and found yellow floating marker.  You know, the old school way of marking a location where you caught fish or mark stucture.  I picked it out of the water and it was broken in the middle so I assumed that someone just left it there.. I decided to bring it aboard and dispose of it properly.  About an hour later we're making our way back to the Marina and this boat with 3 guys pull up and they start to question if we've picked up a marker.. Of course I say yes and explain that I thought is was left behind because it was broken.  What followed was incessant stream of verbal abuse (with excessive profanity) causing my bud's boy to start crying.  Apparently they had used this devise to mark a spot they caught fish and all 3 tore into us.  When we asked them to calm down because they're upsetting the little guy, the response was that we shouldn't have brought him along...  I tossed the marker back towards them into the water (making sure not to hit their nice new aluminum ranger) which brought on more abuse.  We started to leave and one of the guys told us that if we ever come back to this water we should be more aware of other people's property.  Now I can understand marking structure....but LSC is devoid of structure?!?  Not to mention bass and muskie in this area do not hold to any one specific spot.  Maybe a specific area but not a specific spot as they do cruise and roam for forage.  Why use such antiquated means when almost every boat (and this wasn't a 12' tinner by any stretch) when you have GPS?  Why use something like this is such a busy area?  I imagine not being to impressed with that getting caught up in my prop (maybe that's why it was broken??)  I believe that the 3 men represented 3 generations of the same family based on looks/attitude.  How can one get so angry about something so insignificant?  Especially with a young angler in their midst.   Thoughts?    "

That said if i did pick it up and that was the reaction id be pretty upset, where these people get the nerve to yell and scream obscenities in front of a child is beyond me. Sometimes you cant win the world is full of mindless a holes who do and say stupid stuff for little to no reason or with little to no provoking. As i get older its easier for me to walk away but if someone pulled that in front of my daughter i cant imagine it ending well. I hope you can let it go and continue to enjoy your time on the water.
