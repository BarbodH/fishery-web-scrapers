927785,richyb,2015-08-05 00:49:00,774,My grandparents are the same on canal lake. Grandpa spends about an hour a day just keeping the weeds away from his boat enough so that he can take it out.
927844,fishindevil,2015-08-05 11:54:00,6254,Well it would help if the people who own the million dollar homes don't fertilize their lawns 10 feet from the waters edge !!! See it all the time on all the kawarthas not just sturgeon .... Lots of reasons why including the insane boat traffic
927860,AKRISONER,2015-08-05 13:22:00,5558,"the chopped weeds problem is ridiculous on the kawarthas, I literally could not throw top water lures  at all simply due to the amount of crap floating absolutely everywhere.  I think the only real solution is to cut back on boat traffic, which is never going to happen."
927864,Steve,2015-08-05 13:26:00,2075,"or as the article said, cut back on phosphates....  but that isn't going to happen either....  my fear is all the kawartha's are going to be like the ""bog"" soon enough....or at least the mid and lower Kawartha's."
929071,Beans,2015-08-12 00:22:00,3339,"""The City of Kawartha Lakes should either pay to have the weeds removed or reduce our taxes""  REDUCE TAXES !!!  Cliff...Have you been smokin' some of that wacky tabacky ???  Drove by 313 after our lunch at St Dave's Diner today but, nobody home..."
929115,206,2015-08-12 11:45:00,563,I'd like to see the contract you signed saying your water front would be weed free lmao.....I don't think this is a township issue?
