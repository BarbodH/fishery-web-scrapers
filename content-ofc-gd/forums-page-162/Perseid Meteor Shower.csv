928827,spincast,2015-08-10 22:29:00,3279,The annual meteor shower show is on this week  -  Looks like tomorrow night's sky maybe the perfect opportunity for viewing / capturing on film (at least down here) http://www.timeanddate.com/astronomy/meteor-shower/perseid.html  
928829,Fisherman,2015-08-10 22:38:00,7201,"Never fails, it's cloudy with showers."
928830,woodenboater,2015-08-10 22:41:00,2277,hoping for clear skies this week and that it can match the shower from a few years ago. this is also a good link with great information.  http://meteorshowersonline.com/perseids.html
928832,fishindevil,2015-08-10 22:46:00,6254,Seen a few decent ones last night in bobcaygeon  at 10pm northeast direction ... They are really moving fast too .....
928838,netminder,2015-08-10 23:02:00,514,"This stuff fascinates me. Basically proves the solar system isn't even done forming yet, after billions of years. Had a good show over the weekend when I was at my parent's cottage"
929102,lunkerbasshunter,2015-08-12 04:05:00,2585,Sunday night at about 11pm I kept my 9 year old son up to lay on a dock and watch the show.  We saw about 15 in 15 minutes or so before cloud cover came in.  It was pretty awesome.  Guess the time is now to see even more.  Cheers
929105,Old Ironmaker,2015-08-12 04:52:00,8243,"What are you talking about Netminder?  A few of my very religious in laws tell me the earth is a few thousand years old.  Dinosaurs is just a hoax started by people that wanted to make a museum popular in the 1800""s.  I was just outside looking up, nada. My wife was on the phone at the same time in the Muskoka's, clear there but no action either (better not be!!!!) We will look tomorrow night at same time."
929107,Bondar,2015-08-12 06:28:00,817,"Going pretty good out there right now, I saw 8 in about 20-25 mins over st.catharines"
929109,fishindevil,2015-08-12 08:53:00,6254,Ya it's a good show tonight in bobcaygeon !!! Been up since 3am as usual and have seen at least a few dozen !!!! Awesome to see when you are in total darkness

Had a good show over the weekend when I was at my parent's cottage  The meteor shower is not really so much about the universe still growing but that we pass through the debris field of Comet Swift-Tuttle. EVERY year. Most media reports overblow the event and build up expectations but some years can be unbelievably spectacular.  I'll be heading up north to my cabin today and 2 am or so should be the best time for the Persieds tonight so try and stay awake till then. The waning crescent moon will make this year better than others as it comes up around sunrise."
929131,AKRISONER,2015-08-12 12:40:00,5558,"this all makes sense now, i saw 2 shooting stars this past weekend without even paying attention and 1 was a pretty intense and slow moving.  Now i know why!"

The waning crescent moon will make this year better than others as it comes up around sunrise. didn't say anything about the universe... . But based on our knowledge of how the SOLAR SYSTEM formed, this is still kind of like accretion, where all the small stuff gets eaten up by the big stuff. The fact that there's still small stuff out here to be eaten up is really cool.   What are you talking about Netminder?

It's OK, you can tell them continue to think that meteors are chunks of heaven blazing through the sky (whatever that means). But don't look directly at them. It's a bad omen (or good? who knows...).   I actually forgot about this last night... I think the sky was pretty clouded over anyway,"
929154,manitoubass2,2015-08-12 14:39:00,11391,"We seen hundreds last night in NW ontario.  Perfect clear skies, what a show!!!"
929155,mr blizzard,2015-08-12 14:41:00,1589,"With so many clear nights up here in the summer, just luck of the draw we have had 3 nights of showers, would be cool to see"
929161,woodenboater,2015-08-12 14:49:00,2277,"@netminder.  yea, we're but one of who knows how many solar systems out there. Makes one feel less than a grain of sand on all the beaches in the world when you think about it. Would be cool to have a Tardis to see how things look in a billion years or so or to see our sun go supernova"

Not big enough. But I do have a hard time fathoming the other stars not having planets orbiting them. The universe is such an awesome thing.  As Otto would say, ""I don't need drugs to enjoy this, just to enhance it."" lol"
929290,woodenboater,2015-08-13 03:25:00,2277,"skies are looking great after a low bank moved out. meteor acidity is picking up with a couple of spectacular ones to the east and north (heading towards the big dipper), also some faint auroral activity on the north horizon.  supposed to peak at around 2 am so if you can, get outside while the skies are clear !"
929292,manitoubass2,2015-08-13 03:29:00,11391,And now we have t storms lol.  Last night was awesome though! Wish I had a good lens for some pics
929294,Old Ironmaker,2015-08-13 03:39:00,8243,"I'm outside looking up. Clear skies no moon, no meteors and a sore neck. Later maybe. Set the alarm for 03:00."
929299,manitoubass2,2015-08-13 04:00:00,11391,Storm past  Awesome sights right now! Lightening to the east and meteors up above!  OI put your glasses on and look near the big dipper
929329,fishindevil,2015-08-13 12:57:00,6254,it was awesome last night !!!!! a great show at 3:00am !!!!
929331,4x4bassin,2015-08-13 13:47:00,1025,"I agree , absolutely spectacular"
