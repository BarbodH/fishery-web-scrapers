928694,darsky,2015-08-10 15:38:00,586,I remember way back when the mandetory card was first implemented. If the card was lost they would not issue replacements and you would have to pay and pass it online again. Is that still the case? Has anyone gone through this process?
928701,kickingfrog,2015-08-10 16:20:00,8333,Not sure it ever was like that. I believe if you contact the company that issued your card you can pay a fee for a replacement card. Some people get 2 cards (for a extra fee) so that they have a backup.
928703,Craigson,2015-08-10 16:26:00,117,Ya i got a replacement card 2 yrs ago n i originally wrote the test like 15 yrs ago
928704,Ralph Field,2015-08-10 16:28:00,1018,"I agree with KF you do not have to start over, simply contact the issuer and , for a fee, they will replace it."
928713,KLINKER,2015-08-10 17:04:00,256,"Depends on who you got it from, some early outfits didn't keep a registry. My card from CPS is printed on a laminated card so when the laminate comes off so does the print so its history. I carry a copy of my cps diploma. If you know where you got it they should be able to replace it for around $15."
928715,Cast-Away,2015-08-10 17:08:00,790,Your original receipt should have the information on a replacement card.

Has anyone gone through this process?  you can always get a replacement  and if you still have the old paper one call up who did your test and get a new one because they are credit card type now
928758,Mister G,2015-08-10 19:40:00,1429,"Your original receipt should have the information on a replacement card. If he lost the ""CARD"" what are the chances he has the original receipt......I say zero to nothing."
928879,darsky,2015-08-11 02:15:00,586,Yup-was just being lazy. I called Boater Exam and they do replacements. 20 bux for 1 or 35 bux for 3.   I was pretty sure they did not do replacements in the beginning-I could be wrong... 
928957,4x4bassin,2015-08-11 15:43:00,1025,"I have wondered the same thing over the years but now I know . I have always kept my original at home in a ""safe place"" and have photo copies that I carry with me . Wonder if the photo copied card in paper form is even valid ?"
929130,Woodsman,2015-08-12 12:40:00,1286,The regulations state you must carry the card & do not mention anything about a copy being acceptable. I wouldn't chance it.
929185,Dara,2015-08-12 16:23:00,3052,Do they even still ask for a card?  I thought this was something that went the way of kids under 16 having to wear a helmet on a bike
929198,irishfield,2015-08-12 17:11:00,26272,$300 fine.. you bet your ass they ask for this worthless piece of paper or plastic!
929281,manitoubass2,2015-08-13 02:39:00,11391,Up here its the first thing they ask for 100% of the time!  And yes it has to be original not a photocopy lol(imagine doing that with your drivers liscense????)
929285,Old Ironmaker,2015-08-13 02:59:00,8243,"They ask to see the card before they ask for a fishing licence, for sure. I still keep my original temp card with my Passport if I loose mine. I should be able to show that until a replacement comes. How I can loose it in the boat who knows but I know I will someday, 100% guaranteed."
929342,KLINKER,2015-08-13 14:48:00,256,"A boating card is not a license, if you can buy 3 cards you should be able to use a photocopy. I can use a photocopy of my CPS diploma."
