925215,captpierre,2015-07-18 18:40:00,2521,Finally back on the lake. Gonna give the new worm harnesses a go. The word from the neighbours is the walleye bite on North Pigeon is still off. Need a feed of eyes Will keep you posted.
925256,wormdunker,2015-07-19 08:40:00,1711,I was in Bobcaygeon last week end.  The resort owner we stayed at states - weed growth this year is behind schedule - so the fishing has been slow.  Good luck!
925271,captpierre,2015-07-19 13:00:00,2521,Update. Started with a bucktail. Caught 2 18 inch sistas in 2 hrs For the last 2 hrs of the evening trolled a harness with a 6 inch Gulp worm. 3 under slot eyes and 3 panfish. Not bad for a first effort. Gotta increase the size though. Water temps 77. Lots of boat traffic
925282,67ZL1,2015-07-19 15:16:00,51,Water temp is pretty warm. How fast are you trolling? I would be tempted to start at 1.5 to 1.8 MPH and go from there.
925285,Walleye72,2015-07-19 15:53:00,156,"Something I do when I fish Gulp Twister Tails is to tip it with a worm as well.  I know it sounds weird, but I saw a guy doing at the cottage we stay at every year and he was doing well, so I tried it and it worked.    Also, I found stinger hooks were helpful with this setup."
925290,Sinker,2015-07-19 16:33:00,8692,"Yep, 1.5-1.8, right along the weed edge. If your not hitting weeds, you need to get closer. Use a real worm!  S."
925304,67ZL1,2015-07-19 19:19:00,51,"Exactly, live bait out produces plastics most of the time. The bigger the worm the better. If you're still having trouble you might want to try Lindy rigging along the deep weed edges. I usually Lindy on clear hot sunny days."
925306,netminder,2015-07-19 19:20:00,514,"Real worms is the key. I usually pinch the worm in half and hang the outside part of the worm behind, especially if the bite is slow you don't want to show them too much. The stinger only slows the action on the worm too. Basically half worm on single hooks."
925310,Sinker,2015-07-19 19:28:00,8692,Same here.
925316,captpierre,2015-07-19 19:52:00,2521,"I noticed when I hook the Gulp worm nose thru the first hook and body the second, if it's perfectly straight there is little action/spin. If I bend the worm it spins nicely. Is this preferred? Would make sense to me."
925326,67ZL1,2015-07-19 22:08:00,51,"I rig mine to run as straight as possible, less chance of your harness balling up on itself."
925347,Sinker,2015-07-20 01:39:00,8692,"Yep,^...."
925359,Joeytier,2015-07-20 03:46:00,3990,I would use a real worm!
925362,wormdunker,2015-07-20 06:26:00,1711,"Big, fat juicy dew worms is my favourite bait on a harness.  A nice long presentation works best for me.  Last Monday on Erie I couldn't get the walleye to commit to my live bait. So, I hooked on a 5"" Gulp Alive leech.  5 minutes later - wham! - a nice 6.4 lber.  The only fish of the day!"
929031,wildeye rainbow,2015-08-11 22:04:00,123,"speed with a worm harness is very important.  1.5mph should be the target speed.  I was on the French using rental boats with a 15hp motor - if you forward trolled, you would be at 2.1mph.  If you backtrolled, you would get to 1.5mph.  It should helps using a fishfinder with GPS to help with speed.  WR"
