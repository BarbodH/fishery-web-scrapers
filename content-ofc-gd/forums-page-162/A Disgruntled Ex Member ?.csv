929078,ketchenany,2015-08-12 00:47:00,3229,You can't have an * on a  plate!  OFC should have a registered trademark or TM after it to protect the name.  I do a lot of R and TM stuff. TJ must have it covered right?  Hope he is a member and named NOT (North of Cumberland)  Good spot Beans!

929092,Beans,2015-08-12 02:18:00,3339,I only used an * to separate the letters...none on the plate (maybe a crown?)
929093,woodenboater,2015-08-12 02:51:00,2277,I see it as NOT OFteN
