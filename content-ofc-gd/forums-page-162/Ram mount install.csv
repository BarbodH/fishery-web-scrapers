928536,jjcanoe,2015-08-09 14:33:00,744,So I am pimping out the new Crestliner and am wondering if I need a backing plate under the dash for my Ram mount. Typical fiberglass dashboard and I'm installing a Lowrance Elite 7. Is it OK to just drill the holes and regular old SS bolt and washer combo or do I need some extra strength back there?
928537,porkpie,2015-08-09 14:35:00,2521,I have a 7 inch sonar mounted with the larger ram ball mount.  All I have are stainless steel washers back there.  No problems.
928538,Gerritt,2015-08-09 14:39:00,6129,It wouldn't hurt to add a chunk of 1/2-5/8 ply under the dash and bolt through it...  Would probably help prevent flexing and possible spider cracking of the gel coat etc in rough weather. It's added insurance for a chunk of scrap wood.  My opinion anyways.  G

928551,jjcanoe,2015-08-09 16:17:00,744,So 2-1 for backing! I've got plenty of old wood lying around so going to get out the saw...
928553,2 tone z71,2015-08-09 16:30:00,1311,Piece of starboard or big fender washers

928556,Garnet,2015-08-09 16:42:00,2056,It would be how extreme conditions you will face. Eire and St Clair I would be putting the backing on. Larger size stainless steel bolts and nuts.
928559,Dan668,2015-08-09 16:49:00,1120,"I wouldnt even go as far as saying extreme conditions,  both my consoles on my newer lund cracked and were replaced under warranty,  one was untouched, the other cracked far away from the mount.  Could have been the cold,  but for safe measures id highly recommend some sort of backing that doesnt rot. Quality on most boats just isnt there anymore."
928566,jjcanoe,2015-08-09 18:25:00,744,Mostly going to be smaller lakes but the odd trip to Erie BoQ etc. Best to be on the safe side
928620,sauce,2015-08-10 02:17:00,219,"Grab some 1/8 x 2"" aluminum from princess auto or Canadian tire. It comes in 3 foot lengths. Easy to drill through and cut with a hacksaw. Works great as backing and won't rot. Add stainless hardware and a couple drops of loktite and you will have a permanent mount that won't budge."
928642,wormdunker,2015-08-10 07:57:00,1711,I'm with sauce.  Use a piece of aluminum for backing.
928913,Mister G,2015-08-11 10:12:00,1429,"I had used backing on my old boat (30 years) and it was just 1/4"" underlayment so don't fret on what you use.....it never rotted or even looked used when I stripped the depth finder/GPS and VHF radio off this past May.....it was a open boat with a side console with a small windshield.....so whatever you got laying around will work just fine......it's really completely protected under there."
928927,BillM,2015-08-11 12:25:00,17367,I used a big square chunk of 3/4in marine plywood when installing the ram mount on the Lund.  Hasn't ripped off yet
928930,jjcanoe,2015-08-11 12:28:00,744,"Thanks for all the input, I went with a 1/2"" piece of PT plywood. Seems pretty sturdy to me"
928933,KraTToR,2015-08-11 12:51:00,506,A bit more effort that you'll never regret.  Spreading the load over a larger area is never a bad thing.  It may save your console in the unlikely event of an accident as well.
928936,jtracc,2015-08-11 13:13:00,97,"I have a 2012 crestliner fish hawk with 2 rams on the dash. A 5 and a 7 inch unit. The newer crestliners have a reinforced dash. All I did was add extra large washers. Solid as a rock. Accually, the ram up front mounded on the deck came loosed before the one on the dash, so did on of my tm bolts."
