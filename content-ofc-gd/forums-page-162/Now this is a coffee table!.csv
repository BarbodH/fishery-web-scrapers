929126,Joey,2015-08-12 12:18:00,9122,Sweet
929157,mr blizzard,2015-08-12 14:44:00,1589,Even my wife would approve of one in the living room
929168,irishfield,2015-08-12 15:09:00,26272,"Funny John, mine said "" single guy eh ""  !"
929186,Cast-Away,2015-08-12 16:25:00,790,"Very cool, better than the trout stream table I saw at Cabela's Michigan store about 10 years ago."
929191,grimsbylander,2015-08-12 16:37:00,3016,I like the 2hp stir stick!
929197,Mike Pike,2015-08-12 17:08:00,1332,"Hey, what about the couch!???"
929213,Walleye72,2015-08-12 18:22:00,156,That thing is sweet!!  I wonder if the motor is battery operated and spins that little propeller?
929218,Spiel,2015-08-12 18:44:00,9065,That is cool.
929221,solopaddler,2015-08-12 19:25:00,8605,"The table and the couch would be cool in my cottage, definitely not the house.  Neat but kind of kitschy."
929228,CRUD150,2015-08-12 20:18:00,87,Pretty neat!  Make blender drinks from the couch?
929232,wormdunker,2015-08-12 20:34:00,1711,Yah I was thinking the same thing!  The motor is to stir your rum & coke!  LOL!
929247,Old Ironmaker,2015-08-12 22:37:00,8243,"Maybe for the man cave but other then that I'm not so sure. The owner of that ""outdoor"" furniture has a very understanding partner or single. Kitschy to the nines."
929248,kickingfrog,2015-08-12 22:48:00,8333,"Meh, tiller."
929308,Yellow Fever,2015-08-13 10:47:00,139,Table and couch don't really fit do they? But nice job on the table for sure
929313,BillM,2015-08-13 11:39:00,17367,"I hope that's in a cottage (Along with the couches, lol)"
929319,Fish Farmer,2015-08-13 12:22:00,2234,"Hey now thats a nice table. Gives me an idea. Garage door into rec room, back boat into rec room, sit in boat watching game on the big screen, get tackle in boat ready for next fishin venture. Wife says, I have a problem  , I said to wife, yes, can't get on water today, too rough."
