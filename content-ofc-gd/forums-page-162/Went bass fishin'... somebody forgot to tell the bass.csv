Ryan was the first one with a fish in the boat...    His biggest yet, although he was accused of cheating because he switched to a crankbait.    ""Black"" bass for my brother   I found some pike as well     We even got some pike back in the slop with the rubber frogs..  My first though was I had a really solid bass, then i figured it might be a bowfin but once we got it out of the weeds it was another pike.    In the end we caught a few more bass than pike but considering we hadn't caught/seen any pike in these spots for 6 weeks it was a bit of a surprise."
