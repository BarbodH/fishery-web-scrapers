Any recommendations on a shop or  fabric i should consider? I keep the boat outside when in season,  and from dec-apr its stored indoors. So it does see sun and the elements for half a year."

Excellent durability,does not rip or get damaged by the sun and has excellent water repellency qualities and does not need to be retreated for it."
