927998,Locnar,2015-08-05 22:39:00,645,"Spent the weekend up on the north end of Pigeon Lake, and for the most part the fishing was a little slow this year. A few bass were caught, all around 1lb... even the panfish were slow fishing.  After the rain had stopped on Monday morning, I decided we'd try trolling for walleye... as the water was choppy, the skies were gloomy. After only 15-20 minutes, fish on! First muskie landed, not a monster... A little shy of 3ft. Definitely made my weekend. "

928986,mistyriver1,2015-08-11 18:39:00,600,Nice going ! Be careful they are very addictive.  ; )
929013,Locnar,2015-08-11 20:44:00,645,"Hahaha, highly addictive eh? I just need myself a boat first, then I can start trying to target them regularly. Man the fight difference between a muskie and a pike are quite astounding."
