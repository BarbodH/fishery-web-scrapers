928541,GrandRiverWill,2015-08-09 15:06:00,3,Hello Everyone  Looking for some feed back on the Lake Temagami area for cottage and boat rentals. Myself and some friends/family are looking to plan a rustic trip for 4/5 nights in the end of August.  I am hoping to get some recommendations on where to stay. We are looking for more of a cabin than a cottage and would be 6 of us. Thanks in advance!  Will
