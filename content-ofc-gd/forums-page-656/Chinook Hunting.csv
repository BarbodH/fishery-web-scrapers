I won't bore you with details, so here's a quick photo summary of my solo salmon hunting adventures.                                                  My brother decided to get a ticket and join me when he can which is great news.  He was able to land his new PB show above at 28.2 lbs his first night fishing the derby with me.  It's going to take a lot more than that to place though, like 33lbs +!  Bring on Week 2!  Tony"

485889,ccmtcanada,2010-07-16 22:27:00,7971,Solo? If you need a deck hand/photographer give me a call!  Or do I need a ticket even if I'm not fishing?  Some nice fish there Tony!
