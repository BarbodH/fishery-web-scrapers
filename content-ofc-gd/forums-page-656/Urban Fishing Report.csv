Sorry no pics but being solo with my dog just didn't make taking pictures easy.  I was impressed that I was able to battle a few small pike, lose a bass all within a few minutes of downtown guelph. Something about being able to catch fish in the middle of the city was really satisfying. The one pike had a good sized gash out of it, my hope is that it was caused by an even bigger pike.  Came home after a little over and hour after my dog fell/jumped in the water twice! She is obsessed with fishing lures (I am careful to keep her away from the lures) and sometimes gets a little carried away. Thankfully she doesn't like getting wet or I don't think I would be able to take her.  I am looking forward to trying a few more spots in town."

486504,Sketty55,2010-07-19 16:10:00,52,I just drove past the speed river this weekend and was wondering how the bite was as I've read reports in the last couple of years that it hasnt been so hot. Good for you and thanks for posting the report.

I think I'll reward myself after a morning full of boredom @ the courthouse with an afternoon full of awesomeness @ the river.  Mark, if you can PM me a decent spot in town, that'd be sweet.  I'm @ the courthouse which is @ 74 Woolwich St.  Ryan"
