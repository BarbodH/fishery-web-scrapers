486110,streamerstripper,2010-07-17 22:22:00,28, I used to live in Utah and if you hit it right you could have some killer days fishing HUGE cicada dry flies on certain rivers in the summer...tons of fun!
486132,Grimace,2010-07-18 00:02:00,2020,I hate to get all technical on you Dozer but you won't be living underground when you die.  :-p
486145,Handlebarz,2010-07-18 01:14:00,3790,We have always had them as kids here in the SW Ontario we would find there shells by the 100's all of us boys would head home with them covered on our shirts daily and you would always have to place them on your sister or mom just because we were boys.  I did find that they liked maple trees best as my house would have lots but a friend would have none on his tree I dont know what kind maybe oak.  I still here them but we dont have a maple tree so I dont find the shells I guess if I were to head to my neighbours house where I here them from I could get some shells for my son but then again the wife would kill me
486195,esoxansteel,2010-07-18 12:56:00,1307,"  Heard the ol heat bug the last 3 days in a row, and he or she has likely been heard daily since the heat wave started, a welcome noise in the summer, unlike Joe the Crow who sits on the lite pole outside a 6 oclock every morning and caws and caws until we wake up, must be the city version of the farmers rooster"
486377,ehg,2010-07-19 02:40:00,2666,"Have heard them buzzing during the heat of summer since being a child. Many times have found them, even as chrysalis coming out of ground. Tonight my daughter saw this one climbing a tree before it came out of its shell.  "
485634,vinnimon,2010-07-16 00:19:00,2593,"Chatting with a coworker today,I noticed a bug on the shop floor on the other side of him.One Ive never seen before and it was big.It was crawling around and very active.Would not fly away at all. I put it in a cup to show the others and one blurted out its name,gave us a story on its life span as well. Its a fair size fly,transparent wings,eyes on top of its head as well.Apparently it lives under groung until its ready to mate.After a 17 or 18 yr life. Has anyone seen or know about this bug.Sorry I cant recall the name nor have any pics. Do fish eat them? Thanks in advance Vin"
485636,kickingfrog,2010-07-16 00:23:00,8333,"Sounds like a cicada (sp?) Most of us have heard them, less have seen one."
485637,Burtess,2010-07-16 00:27:00,901, Yup... sounds like a cicada....http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cicada  Burt
485642,Grimace,2010-07-16 00:36:00,2020,Funny.  I saw one of those on my deck the day before yesterday.  For the first time ever.  None of us had ever seen one.  Interesting.  He was also acting the same.
485656,spincast,2010-07-16 01:01:00,3279,Defintely Cicada. welcome climate change. When I lived in Wva they would hatch and make one heck of a racket for a couple days - then gone. Once when I was a kid one landed on me while I was on the swings.  I think that patch of grass beneath that swing is still the greenest in the state.
485664,Burtess,2010-07-16 01:23:00,901," What does that have to do with climate change??  I have been listening to cicadas since I was a little kid, and they were around before me!  Burt"
485667,Jewelbee,2010-07-16 01:26:00,422,"I've seen this bug before, but didn't know anything about it...very interesting info !"
485670,fishing n autograph,2010-07-16 01:31:00,2540,"Haven't heard them in a while, but I did see one when I was 10 or so...my brother and I didn't know when it was....so he tapped it with his foot....damn those things are loud up close!"
485677,irishfield,2010-07-16 01:41:00,26272,"Ah... the old ""heat bug"" !"
485684,alexcba,2010-07-16 02:04:00,634,lol those things were good alarms in the am when they would start buzz sawing.
485693,GBW,2010-07-16 02:43:00,8460,So THAT's what it look like....  Thanks.
485718,OhioFisherman,2010-07-16 06:07:00,6623,"We seem to get them to a degree every summer, although some years are far worse than others. I took my kids to a small lake near me about 10 years ago and there were so many the noise they were making was disturbing.  Enough of them together and they give off a low humming that is far worse than the loud noise they make. If they land in the water fish eat them."
485837,Bob,2010-07-16 20:02:00,370,"Anytime I've been lucky enough to find one when I'm fishing, it goes right on the hook. Trout love them."
485839,BillsTheBassMan,2010-07-16 20:15:00,932,"Very cool V, thanks for sharing.  I've been hearing these bugs since I was born, but have yet to see one.  At least now I'll know what I am looking at."
485840,Cookslav,2010-07-16 20:16:00,1457, Was thinking the same thing LOL...
485842,muskeybugged,2010-07-16 20:19:00,282,"I was in Mason Ohio last summer and we were plagued with them buggers on the golf course...never knew they could fly such distance after only hearing them in tree's around these parts, it was neat to finally see them in action."
485843,kickingfrog,2010-07-16 20:26:00,8333," I was a kid the first time I saw one, thinking it was a house fly, I thought ""How big was the pile of dung that that thing came off of?""  Second thought was that it was a horse fly and ""I don't want that thing to bite me!"""
485844,ketchenany,2010-07-16 20:27:00,3229,Put a few hundred in a box and take them to a soccer game!  In Europe as kid saw them bey the thousands.
485849,bigugli,2010-07-16 20:39:00,6138,"I can't remember where in the eastern states we were visiting, but we happened to be there when a major brood emerged. The sidewalks and streets were covered with them every morning."
485865,Joey,2010-07-16 21:48:00,9122,"Well I've been lucky enough to see lots of them.  They were around since I was a kid too.  Kinda ugly, big buggers.  Love their noise.  Joey"
485894,Twocoda,2010-07-16 22:33:00,4130,they are actually buzzing right now as i type this ....i always thought of them as the August bug ....but they are out in full swing right now and its only mid July
485907,OhioFisherman,2010-07-16 23:01:00,6623,"They actually shed their shell-skin when they come above ground, they don`t have wings until it`s shed. You can see them once in a while stuck to trees."
486073,Dozer,2010-07-17 17:45:00,896,"Its a crazy life cycle, they had this bug on one of David Attenbroughs nature flicks.  Its not for me though, I'll live under ground when I die, thank you very much"
486074,siwash,2010-07-17 17:54:00,683,"i've seen (and heard) lots of them.. very common  mot often, I come across expired ones..."
486075,Guest Johnny Bass,2010-07-17 17:55:00,0,I've seen many.They sound like the electric wires above are buzzing.
