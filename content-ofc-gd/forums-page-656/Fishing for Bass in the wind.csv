Slight chop on the water and I am wondering how I am gonna keep the canoe in line for fishing the shores. Good thing I always have my Blackberry with me. Lol checked a couple of sites and not only found out how I was gonna control the canoe(tied a 2gallon pale to the tail to slow the drift) but I also saw a tip or two for fishing the windy conditions. Well, it paid off! I had the lake all to my self until 7pm tonite(started at 8:30 am). Got a dozen decent bass and one with an MNR tag in it too.It was a great day(pics tomorrow when I get home) out there ""meditating with the fish about stuff and thins"" lol. I am sleepin in the van tonite and gonna try to add some inches to our team(one) with some pike on a river that is known to have some monsters in it tomorrow mornin. I figured I may as well stay in the van as my university daughter and her friends are having a sleep over and I just don't need those visions in my head tonite. Lol. See ya all tomorrow and good luck out there.  Splashhopper"
