486113,Fisherpete,2010-07-17 22:33:00,1814,Couldn't find it at Canadian Tire... anyone know where to grab some in the GTA? I want to add some to the tank next time out.
486114,Grimace,2010-07-17 22:35:00,2020,Napa uap carries it.
486116,Woodsman,2010-07-17 22:54:00,1286,Yup what Grimace said.I just picked up a bottle at my local UAP/NAPA in St.Marys today.
486129,NANUK,2010-07-17 23:55:00,797,CARQUEST also sells the stuff
486140,Muskieman,2010-07-18 00:51:00,2472,Buy more than one can... You're gonna want to use in everything that burns gas that you may own.  SF-16  is the part # @ any Uni-Select member.   Randy 
486148,siwash,2010-07-18 01:27:00,683,Is it that good??? I've heard of this stuff but seems a bit gimicky
486151,Muskieman,2010-07-18 01:43:00,2472," I've used it now for 20 years and haven't looked at any other additive.  I used to sell it when I worked as a parts man...many garages swear by it enough so to buy 150+ cans a month .... In July of 2009 I personally sold more than 400 cans... not Including the spray ""Deep Creep"" Dt-14.  I swear by it and so do many other board members.  Randy "

486170,HTHM,2010-07-18 03:54:00,4082,I have seen it at Parts source in Hamilton.
486188,Guest Johnny Bass,2010-07-18 11:51:00,0,I'm pretty sure I bought mine at CT. Maybe not all CT carry it.
486247,mbac31,2010-07-18 16:21:00,904,"I have been a long time user of Seafoam in everything I own, Truck, Boat, Bike,etc. But I have done of research on this topic and have found a better one and its sold at CT as well. Starbrite (Startron)  Much better and will break down enzymes in the fuel for you much better and has more advanced cleaning adjents. Dont run this stuff in every tank as its does build up in the injectors and valves. Usually every 8-10 tanks is best."
