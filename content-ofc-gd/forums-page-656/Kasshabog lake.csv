486064,Paully,2010-07-17 16:25:00,712,"Im renting a cottage on kasshabog for the end of august and have never been on this lake. I know there are walleye musky and bass in the lake. Can anyone give me some general information on places to try on the lake? Is it a shallow lake ? If anyone got a map for it, that would be good too. I heard that there is a dam at the south end of the lake.. is it worth a try?"
486084,alexcba,2010-07-17 19:21:00,634,did a little bit of searching for you. theres some general info of the lake. other sources speculate its max depth is around 115 feet.. average runs at about 15.  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kasshabog_Lake_%28Ontario%29

486250,Black_Blade,2010-07-18 16:29:00,258,"A couple years ago now, a buddy and I set up camp and fished for the weekend.  We put in at the landing off Peninsula Road and travelled by boat north east(??)to set up camp.  We didn't have any luck for walleye, but the bass fishing was pretty good.  We used mostly jig worms, wacky worm rigs, drop shot and deadsticking.  Few pics of some of the nice ones we got.  "
