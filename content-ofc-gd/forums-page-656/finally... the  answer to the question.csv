The short answer: the chicken.  The long answer is contained in the analysis called Structural Control of Crystal Nuclei by Eggshell Protein by British scientists Colin Freeman and John Harding of the University of Sheffield and David Quigley and P. Mark Rodger of the University of Warwick, published in the current journal Angewandte Chemie.  “It had long been suspected that the egg came first, but now we have the scientific proof that shows in fact the chicken came first,” said Freeman.  Sort of.  What came first was a particular chicken protein found in the bird’s ovaries that governs crystal growth and how it spawns an eggshell overnight.  The protein ovocledidin-17 (OC-17) is found only in the hard part of the shell, but scientists have long wondered what its role has been in the creation of calcite crystals and an eggshell.  Using the U.K. national supercomputer in Edinburgh to simulate how the protein clamps on to a surface, the researchers also noticed that OC-17 sometimes just falls off on its own.  The research took 5 million core hours of computer simulations using a tool called metadynamics, the team reported.  What evolves is “an incredibly elegant process” of formation, detaching and more formation that manages to produce an eggshell within 24 hours.  That knowledge, said Harding, “can also give clues towards designing new materials and processes.”  Whether the Warwich-Sheffield solution definitively answers the age-old conundrum remains to be seen.  A few years ago, a British geneticist, a philosopher and a chicken farmer pooled their resources and concluded that the egg came first. The first egg to have the DNA of a chicken would hatch into a chicken, said professor John Brookfield of the University of Nottingham in 2006.  Chimed in scientific philosophy professor David Papineau of King’s College London:  “If a kangaroo laid an egg from which an ostrich hatched, that would surely be an ostrich egg, not a kangaroo egg.”  Brookfield and Papineau were speaking at the behest of Disney as a promotion for the film Chicken Little. But their theory has been the prevailing one.  According to How Stuff Works, “Two non-chickens mated and the DNA in their new zygote contained the mutation(s) that produced the first true chicken. Prior to that first true chicken zygote, there were only non-chickens.”  Alice Shirrell Kaswell took a different tack in her 2003 experiment. Using the U.S. Postal Service, she separately mailed a chicken and an egg.  The chicken arrived first."

In evolutionary terms the egg always comes first. The random mutation that causes a new trait to develop in offspring (and then be naturally selected, or not, for survival) occurs in the DNA of the parent animal, but that animal itself does not change. The effects of the mutation show up once the egg begins to develop, and a new species is born. Evolutionary biologists are currently tearing their hair out over yet another journalistic mangling of basic science."

485741,Cudz,2010-07-16 11:36:00,2652,Chicken was created first. Done.  Easy answer.
485761,Fisherman,2010-07-16 14:02:00,7201,Well I'd sure like to meet the dumbazz who stuck the drumsticks that close to the butt.
485767,Dave Bailey,2010-07-16 14:27:00,1641, 
485956,Cudz,2010-07-17 02:02:00,2652,yep
485982,HTHM,2010-07-17 03:22:00,4082,You will
486179,Jewelbee,2010-07-18 07:23:00,422,Oh God help me.....chickens....I can tell you a laying hen is A LOT nastier than an egg
486186,Fisherman,2010-07-18 11:45:00,7201,I always figured it was easier to lay an egg than a chicken.
486200,kickingfrog,2010-07-18 13:46:00,8333, You've spent a lot of time thinking about this???
486204,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2010-07-18 14:00:00,0," Man, I sure wish I was around 6000 years ago to meet the dinosaurs!"
486206,Cudz,2010-07-18 14:05:00,2652,Lol.  Guess you need to read it all. A year in the life is but a blink of his eye.
486207,Twocoda,2010-07-18 14:06:00,4130,"with every answer comes more questions  what do you think they ate for breakfast before eggs materialized??? as far as the ""Adam and Eve"" spawning from his rib scenario....hmmmmmmmm ....now thats not something you see everyday now ....is it   ...almost as funny as immaculate conception...lol...imagine that one ...if it was your daughter that came home pregnant.."
486211,Fisherman,2010-07-18 14:08:00,7201," 6000,    I think you're a few years short"
486214,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2010-07-18 14:11:00,0,5970 to be exact!
486215,kickingfrog,2010-07-18 14:13:00,8333,Anybody read Carl Sagans book Billions and Billions?
486217,Twocoda,2010-07-18 14:15:00,4130," not to be morbid but... define ""lay""  some how i predict this thread to flame in record time !!!!"
486243,Paully,2010-07-18 15:55:00,712,What came first Oranges or the color Orange?
486245,Twocoda,2010-07-18 16:16:00,4130, side note .....NOTHING rhymes with orange..or is there ??? its all about perception...
