486192,Dave Bailey,2010-07-18 12:15:00,1641," They're pretty good in my experience. Let's look at the job - you are granted a lot of power over other people, you are given a firearm, a club, handcuffs, and a high-powered vehicle with all sorts of bells and whistles. Face it, that job is tailor made to attract every whack-job jack-booted fascist with an overbearing ego. I think the various police forces around are doing a fairly good job of weeding those types out during the application and selection process, the training process, and then the first few weeks on the street. A few will slip through, but most are good people."
486194,Big Cliff,2010-07-18 12:46:00,6899," What I am finding interesting about this thread is that some guys only ever seem to hit the bad ones while some others only ever seem to hit the good ones   Do you think it might be attitude, body language, just the way we react to being stopped?  I'd like to hear it from a cops perspective. What is it (apart from being cute, blond, big headlights, and a short skirt) that makes you let one guy/gal go with a warning and throw the book at the next one? How big a factor do WE play in your decision and what do you really look for? Wouldn't it be nice if we could all learn something from this!"
486197,Cudz,2010-07-18 13:33:00,2652,No hate toward cops here.  I have 3 friends on the city force and my next door neighbour is on the South Simcoe squad. I do pay over $4500 in taxes though.  Barrie taxes are bad.  Too much snow removal in the winter.
486199,dave524,2010-07-18 13:44:00,4508," Wise words from some one with a a life's worth of experience, curiously most of the younger generation are also figuring this out quite a bit later in life than in our day, if at all sometimes."
486203,kickingfrog,2010-07-18 14:00:00,8333," Hey, weren't you whining about three inches of snow on your street this past winter that wasn't plowed until the next day???  None of us likes paying taxes, and we would think $300 is too much if we had been paying $250 last year. The boat is insured so the direct cost to the force, and in the end to us, is reality small. Although the $25000 total price tag divided by the 130 thousand people in the city works out to less than 20 cents for ever man, woman and child; I don't wonder if it would be cheaper to just pay the bill instead of the increased premium going forward."

There's a few things, previous record, run you on the system and it shows, some just don't learn and have to have an audience with the Judge..repeatedly. 3.  How did your actions affect other traffic around you, did you cause a hundred car pile up or are you day dreaming with your hand in your pants. 4.  Attitude..oh it's not my fault, if you were at the donut shop you never would have caught me speeding in the first place, or don't you have some more important crime to resolve.  Cellphone, what cellphone, I was just reprogramming my head by placing my communication device close to the hearing access port. 5.

Like I said in last years post. Try walking a mile in their shoes and you will understand why some are the way that they are.""   while it does appear this way (there has certainly been alot of heated debates!) the majority of these posts are asking to share your experience.  one can share a story (good or bad) and the reader is to decide whether to hate cops or not.  you're not a pariah for sharing the story is what im trying to say. if the bulk of your experience on or off the water with police is negative you're not a 'police hater', you're just a guy responding to the post.  now half the OFC community wants to take you on for 'attacking' ontario's finest, but you didn't, you just told a story.   what would be intersting is to post a 'dumb electrician gets zapped' story. we'd all respond with funny stories of getting electrocuted.  do you think all kinds of electricians would get their backs up and start telling us to walk a mile in their shoes and calling us names? probably not. any way another post about as far off the trailer as a barrie police boat....."

Asking for a break doesn't work. Telling me I'm just filling my quota isn't going to work either. 3) If you have an extensive criminal record you can count on getting one or more tickets...I'm sorry that's the way it is...especially if you've been charged with assault police.  All in all, if you're polite, take your lumps and not give dumb excuses then you should be okay....unless you are over 70...I don't really ticket people that could be my grand mother.  For example...stopped a guy today for going 106 in a 50...his excuse...oh its my wifes car and I just touched the gas to get up the hill...uhh no you didn't lol...  I can't speak for the opp but with the guys I work with you're most likely going to get a 10 over if you're nice. But I mean, if you don't do anything wrong then you won't get a ticket right? I'm not saying I'm perfect and I have gotten tickets before too...but seriously...most people don't pay attention to how fast they're going, don't carry the proper documentation, don't come to a complete stop at stop signs or red lights...  Anyway, if you want more advice then feel free to ask but if you're going to jump all over this post then don't waste your time lol"

486270,Big Cliff,2010-07-18 18:47:00,6899,"  Thanks FFA, perhaps that is why I have never had an issue. Yes, I did get a few tickets when I was much younger but I deserved every one of them and I can't ever remember the cop not giving me a break even though they didn't need to. I actually had one tell me he was sorry he had to ticket me (still gave me the ticket though LOL but I really did deserve it).  I've gotten many breaks too. Driving on the sholder of the road; we were in a traffic jam on the QEW for over an hour, the next exit was in sight, Sue had been telling me for about an hour and 10 minutes that she had to get to a washroom NOW!!! So I drove down the sholder to the exit where I got stopped. Explained to the officer, he asked for my license, took it, directed me to the nearest place with a washroom and told me he would meet me there. When he got there Sue was just coming out of the washroom with a huge smile of reliefe on her face, he took one look at her and laughed, told me he had a wife too and totally understood, gave me back my license and told us to have a nice day! crap, I thought Sue was going to kiss him LOL!  The last ticket I got was 30 years ago, I was driving down Hwy 69, bright red camero, windows down, tunes cranked and driving much faster than I should have been. (man that car could GO!)Never even saw the cruser until he was right behind me.  Nice young cop, asked me if I had a good story to tell him LOL. I just laughed and told him the truth, it was my wife's car, she wasn't there, it was only the second or third time she had ever let me drive it, I was on my way back down to TO with my son, the sun was shining, traffic was light, I was just in a good mood and it just felt right but if I had known he was there I'd have slowed down. He laughed told me that at least I was honest about it gave me a ticket for 10 over and told me to slow it down a bit.  Perhaps my early years in the army taught me to respect authority, might just be that my parents taught me to try to respect everyone until they proved they didn't deserve respect. Could just be that when I show respect, I seem to get respect in return! Whatever the reason, I like it just the way it is (and it's saved me a lot of money over the years LOL).  I guess the lesson to be learned here is: you have to plant a seed to get a crop, the seeds you plant usually determine the kind of crop you'll get. In this case, the seed seems to be called attitude!"

485890,spincast,2010-07-16 22:27:00,3279,"Under the highway traffic act an insecure load is a minimum 6 points on the driver's license. NSC 10 , which is the regulation for load securement, clearly outlines the minimum requirements for a secure load. Any load must have a minimum working load limit of 0.8g to resist forward movement, .5 g backward, .2 g upward and .5 g side to side (1 g = the weight of the load). The operator is requiired to check and verify load securement at the time the do their pre trip inspection, and every 3 hours or 50 km thereafter.  A secondary means of securement is required on several types of load securement.  Cleary these guys didn't do any of the above, and from a guy who has been in the provincial court defending due diligence cases - I'd like to see them defend this one. Charges under the Police Services Act may be more punishing from an employment perspective, but IMO charges should be laid under the HTA, and, assuming this vehicle was over 4500 kg GVW, against the CVOR  of the Police Force, as it is a CMV. Most transport companies would terminate a driver who was so negligent.  I remember a few years ago when flying wheels were an issue and the MTO's sanding truck lost a set of duals while out on duty. Didn't hear much fall out after that one either  As a guy who has spent the last 30 years ensuring my vehicles and drivers are safe and exceed the requirements, I'm fed up with seeing OPP and local police put on lights and sirens as a way to get back to the office at 150  K + so they can clock out, ignore the rules of the road because it is inconvenient and then blast someone who makes a rolling stop at an interection when no one -- other than them hiding in a bush 200 meters away -- was around. I'm not saying that all officers are like this - but I see enough of them that I feel its an issue. And these guys in Barrie - well they need to be hung out to dry -- cause they sure can't handle something that goes in the water  OK soap box,  down 1 step, 2 step.... going to have a beer now and rest, well vented....."

I will try and make this a short story.  Two seasons ago I was up at Lakair with a bunch of ONFers we were heading for shore lunch with Kevin (he was in his own boat) and had just talked to the MNR and OPP they were in a boat just ahead of us the boat I was in was Brand new well the OPP boat comes right over to use at a high rate of speed he could not stop we had my self my daughter My VERY OLD friend and his young wife on his boat I had to lean way out over the boat to try and stop this OPP from bashing us it did not stop them all the way I did hurt my back and yes it was stupid to try and stop them but they turned around and came in to us very fast again I was not pleased at all WTH were they trying to prove? I could under stand if they saw us breaking the law or trying to run away we were stopped to wait for them to pass by in a narrow section of the lake.  Sorry for the rant I like to see them out there but feel that they need to have some major training before getting out on the water.
486009,Big Cliff,2010-07-17 09:29:00,6899," Guess we have the last of the good ones here then, in the ten years we've lived here I haven't had any issues. I have always been treated in a polite friendly manner. Even when Sue got a ticket just after we moved here (she was doing 85 in what she thought was an 80 zone), turned out she was actually in a 60 zone, they reduced it to 10 over.  Last spring I had an incident with my ATV: Riding two up, (not allowed) Riding on a public road (not allowed), my helmit was sitting on my front rack, (my bad) my wallet was sitting on my dresser in the house with my license, insurance, and registration in it. I got stopped not 20 yards from my driveway, I hate to think what those fines could have totled but instead, we had a nice chat and I was told not to do it again!

Makes no sense and again our law makers making laws that say do as I say not as I do. I have always had a problem with that, believing in lead by example."

I tried to stop their boat but it was too heavy.  I bit my tongue and they were super nice guys it was just that they did not respect my boat.  I must also add that that is the first time the MNR has ever not been perfect around me and my boat.  We have been checked a billion times and they are always nice friendly and good with taking care of the boats."

They were very courteous and just wanted to make sure my paperwork was in order and that we had lifejackets that FIT. I had my 11 yr old nephew with me. I didn't have my vessell registration with me and played dumb and handed him my trailer registration. He explained what I needed and where to get it if I didn't have it. While the cop doing the talking was explaining things one of the others was writing like crazy. I asked him what he was writing and he said just general information. I was going to ask why there was for full time cops on board but thought I better not press my luck. We were drifting towards a submerged rock pile that I was about to fish when they rolled in and I told them and they were not aware of it and thanked me for telling them and they backed out and were gone. They didn't even mention the fine for not having my vessell registration but I have it in my boat now.

Robert Allan.  Officers in the larger police boat, a 27-foot Stanley, were forced to intentionally ram the smaller vessel to bring it to a stop, he said, adding that both craft sustained ""significant"" damage as a result.  Around 5 p. m. Saturday, both the boats were out on Kempenfelt Bay, checking the engine on the larger vessel.  ""They thought everything was OK and were coming in when the pontoon boat hit a large wave, knocking the officer out of the boat. The boat run on manual unmanned in a circular pattern,"" Allan said, adding it could have possibly struck the officer.  ""Because he was wearing a personal flotation device, it's very difficult to dive under the water below the propeller. It was certainly a life-threatening situation,"" he said. ""The bigger boat had to ram the smaller boat to prevent harm to the officer.""  Allan said there were no injuries, but that both officers were shaken up. The cost to repair both boats was unknown yesterday, but city police will utilize the services of boats from other area police agencies to continue monitoring the bay.  "

Next time they stop me and ask for safety equipment I'm gonna tell them, only if I get to check you guys too."
485823,JohnF,2010-07-16 18:56:00,3494,  Let us know how that works out for you.  JF
485828,kickingfrog,2010-07-16 19:33:00,8333,"Upside down is not completely accurate. It was flipped over, with the console and the gunwale on the ground. If upside down is 180 degrees and on its side is 90 degrees then it was 120-150 degrees. I would agree that it must have happened turning from Cundles onto Livingstone or swerving to avoid something. I don't know where the boat was coming from, but if it was going to launch in Simcoe (as was stated in the article) it seems like they were taking an odd route."
485835,Abraxus,2010-07-16 19:58:00,104," I fully agree with the above.  There is absolutely no way that all three securing methods failed at once!  Maybe if they maintained it like they themselves owned it instead of the tax payer, this sort of nonsense would not occur.  I have never had, nor have seen any ONE of those straps fail on any of my boats over the years.  Let alone all of them!  Ab"
485841,fishing n autograph,2010-07-16 20:19:00,2540,Its possible...but its more of a punishment to get charged under the police services act
485852,Fisherman,2010-07-16 21:05:00,7201,"Oh it's possible, but then they were using equipment (straps) that are not up to snuff, hmmm..ya right. Along with a secondary tie down.  No use trying to prop these guys up, been there, haven't done that."
485856,Billy Bob,2010-07-16 21:33:00,5865,"Yo'all are looking at this the wrong way.....it seems to me that there are some lakes out there that will be much safer without these clowns on them....  As Forest Gump once said ""just one less thing to worry about""...."
485857,Whitespinnerbait,2010-07-16 21:35:00,2038, Here Here ........   Lets tell it the way it is.
485858,fishing n autograph,2010-07-16 21:36:00,2540,i meant it's possible that they got charged....often times the ones in charge go for the more severe because the HTA tickets aren't going to send a message
485859,misfish,2010-07-16 21:40:00,29133,  Enough said right there.
485861,fishing n autograph,2010-07-16 21:44:00,2540, Same thing that would happen if they wrote off a cruiser
