486296,pike slayer,2010-07-18 20:06:00,1177,"i was down at the mouth of the goulais river 20min north of sault ste. marie. I was casting on shore for smallies and pike and i hooked into this guy. He was my first ever musky. i didnt weigh or measure the fish, just took a picture and threw him backtheres not to much musky water around here so it was definitely a treat getting this guy and considering the amount i've been out this year. i also got out yesterday to my favorite pike lake, it was windy and rough and hard to control the boat, it was a nice day but kind of slowww, my buddy and i only caught 22 pike(40-50 is usually you're average) we got some decent 4-5pounders but nothing big on this trip, nothing worth taking pics of, we brought 6 home for a meal. <a href=""http://s167.photobucket.com/albums/u137/gavinpee/?action=view&current=DSCF0037.jpg"" target=""_blank""><img src=""http://i167.photobucket.com/albums/u137/gavinpee/DSCF0037.jpg"" border=""0"" alt=""Photobucket""></a>"
