485678,jediangler,2010-07-16 01:42:00,1923,Glad everyone involved is OK and the runaway boat didn't cause any bodily harm to other nearby competitors. I've never heard of this happening at a kayak fishing tournament though  .
485755,mart,2010-07-16 13:35:00,93,Good to hear JP and Greg weren't injured. Must of been a scary moment when it happened. It can happen to anyone so safe boating everyone...
485764,irishfield,2010-07-16 14:16:00,26272,Hey JP... there are better ways to try and get your pilots licence!!!  Glad everyone is okay.. and the boat survived as well.
485768,TJQ,2010-07-16 14:38:00,7806,Glad no one got hurt!! I'd be the pot calling the kettle black if I was gonna preach.
485899,Twocoda,2010-07-16 22:46:00,4130, thats funny.....i suppose it could though ....if you didnt secure your kayak to the roof of your vehicle ....it would probably fly off on the way to the tournament...

486527,davis,2010-07-19 17:59:00,128,"  My little 25hp outboard doesn't have a kill switch. In light of this event/thread, I'm thinking again that I should seriously look into installing one, if possible. Before I hit up the search engines, does anyone know of a method or means by which I can do this? Are there kill-switch kits that I can purchase and wire in?"
486531,Twocoda,2010-07-19 18:13:00,4130," no no no ...according to my wife its ""dont pinch or your gonna get throttled""  im going to start a group called Throttled Hubbies...lol...."
485034,Harrison,2010-07-13 19:10:00,2202, Hopefully 8 lbs...
485048,aniceguy,2010-07-13 19:44:00,1094,"  Charles break 8 lb with 5 fish, I never knew pink senko's can get you that sorta weight  I hear though he has trouble climbin on trailers though"
485051,charlesn,2010-07-13 19:45:00,551," Ouch...  lol, good one Phill, I'm gonna be down on the ground clutching my groin area for a bit after that low blow...  Nicely done.  I did manage more than my usual 8 lbs for this event.  As for the event, I was in a bit of shock when I heard about it as I doubt many people have had as good of a view as I have in terms of what a boat driver JP really is.  We have been in some hairy situations yet I've never doubted and would fish again with him tomorrow.  I'm happy he and Greg were okay.  They came over during the event and if he hadn't mentioned it, you hardly would've known anything had happened.  The heat had already dried them off and they were both just fishing hard and joking around like usual.  Very grateful that someone as quick thinking and experienced as Doug was there as well as Blake from OFC who I heard used his boat to make sure nobody ran thru the area occupied by the ""swimmers"".  Just goes to show the kind of guys they are that they instantly put JP and Greg's welfare first.  Doug rescued a few fellows that had pretty much the exact same thing happen last year where there was boat damage and some injuries.  As I recall Doug won that tournament, good karma I guess."
485052,charlesn,2010-07-13 19:46:00,551, I get up on them fine - climbing down in wet flip flops is something I could use a refresher course on...
485058,archie_james_c,2010-07-13 20:17:00,618,"  Good point Spiel.  For the last few years I have grown accustomed to not wearing a life jacket on the boat, this summer I've made it my personal goal to get in the habit of having the jacket and tether on whenever the boat is on plane.  The tether is on my wrist at all time besides trolling, as my uncles friend almost went overboard on his tiller this year when he fell off his seat and the tiller bucked sideways on him as he was coming up on plane...no tether attached.  The sled guys have got this tether thing down pat, why boaters don't is beyond me!"
485060,BUSTER,2010-07-13 20:24:00,1336,Glad to hear Jp and company are ok  Now I want to know the exact spot this happened so i can go diving for all that Wicked gear that flew out of the boat!
485064,lookinforwalleye,2010-07-13 20:36:00,4399,Thanks for sharing the real story JP and I like the rest of the OFC members are glad you survived the dunking and will fish another day.
485095,Harrison,2010-07-13 22:16:00,2202,"Ah Charles, most know you can get 8lbs with your eyes closed..............on Simcoe lol"

485100,Dutch,2010-07-13 22:32:00,831,Glad to hear everyone is OK.  Must have been an eye opener.
485118,Terry,2010-07-13 23:08:00,14456,"well I am not one of the guys that hate bass boat people,, I hate that I sold mine  some people do have a very narrow view of what fishing means and look down on and complain about all other type of fishing and bass tourneys falls outside their narrow view....I think there is a place for all types of fishing  and it was real standup of you to come on and post......."
485233,fish_fishburn,2010-07-14 12:37:00,1311,"Thank god you had a gas pedal J.P. The same thing happened on White lake about 5 years ago to a couple of brothers during a bass tourney. They didn't have a gas pedal and were ejected only to have the boat do circles around them at w.o.t. Both were killed from the boat running over them when they were trying to swim away. A gas pedal is the most important safety feature in any high performance boat and every bassboat should have one. This also happened to a buddy a few years ago during a tourney, he is like 6'4 240 and said he felt like a bag of groceries flying out of the boat he was driving. He tore the shifter off his boat and was badly bruised from armpit to arse on the side that went over the shifter. Glad your both okay."
485491,BillsTheBassMan,2010-07-15 14:54:00,932, That's great advice Spiel that I've never considered - thanks for sharing!
485496,BillsTheBassMan,2010-07-15 15:04:00,932," Glad to hear you're both safe JP.  I agree that this is no joking matter.  The same people joking about this now are the ones who'd be offering their ""condolences"" if there was a worse outcome, which there very well could have been.  Point 4 - It's funny how the human psyche reacts to these situations - you laughed it off and fished - that sounds crazy, but it isn't.  I barrel-rolled down a hill off a highway with my buddy in a freak frost, tools were flying around in his truck, we flipped 5-6 times, nobody stopped to help us, and the truck took about 5K worth of damage.  We were in good moods, laughing, and later we went and played some poker - elated.  There were consistent jokes about ""I don't want to see you with a lawyer and whiplash next week"" etc.  After the shock clears, you're really just thrilled to be completely uninjured and you're amazed at the luck of it all.  Thanks for clearing these things up, and thanks for whoever changed the title to this thread - it was a little classless before.  Ryan"
485566,POLLIWOGG,2010-07-15 20:23:00,835,Was the accident reported? Any charges laid? Cause if he's trying to keep it under wraps that ship has sailed.
485568,Terry,2010-07-15 20:26:00,14456,ok
485569,irishfield,2010-07-15 20:28:00,26272,"Yah,, I typed that Terry and hit the back button! I think he's talking about the truck incident in the post above his! .. and I think you missed a ""don't"" in your second line. If you DON'T cause..."
485573,misfish,2010-07-15 20:58:00,29133,"Sorry Wayne,but thats, DIDNT."
485575,BillsTheBassMan,2010-07-15 21:03:00,932,"Well if he is referring to the truck incident (which I don't think he is) the accident was reported, no charges were laid, and it took OPP 4 hours to respond (again, freak frost that caused many o' accident).  If you're referring to the boat accident then he doesn't have to report it to anybody as you've been told.  Regardless Polli, I don't see how police reports are your business in either case."
485576,bigbuck,2010-07-15 21:05:00,2449,"JP, good to hear you are OK!! That would scare the bejeezus outta me. I had a big cruiser blasting along putting out a 5-6ft wake a coupla weeks ago on the way to Giants Tomb to hit the beach with the kids, I turned into it quick and killed the throttle, it still made me have air under my butt and rattled the girls and for the first time, water came over the front of my boat (19ft Larson Fish 'N Ski). What happened to me was different but could have had a similar outcome. Needless to say, thankfully I always wear my inflatable PFD and have the kill cord attached when I'm out on the big water of GBay."
485577,Tybo,2010-07-15 21:20:00,1373,JP. Glad your good. Great to hear you got back on the hoarse. Just don't become over cautious on that steering wheel now. After one of my big hits.(seat torn from the floor.)I was being to tight with the wheel. I started over steering going straight and letting  the boat slide in corners. It took a bit too relax behind the wheel again.But it happened. You hold the steering wheel in a boat like you hold a beautiful woman. Firmly.But not over controlling.
485578,irishfield,2010-07-15 21:25:00,26272, Is that like cup the curves...  but don't squeeze the throttle.  (don't worry Spiel.. I'll be gone by morning! lol)
485632,camillj,2010-07-16 00:13:00,1988,No Wayne .. don't pinch the throttle
485658,Handlebarz,2010-07-16 01:05:00,3790,Dang Jp that sure sound like on hell of a ride glad to here you and Greg are Ok I guess that means I should get my teather out I keep putting off the self inflating life jacket but maybe its time to get one.
485665,Radnine,2010-07-16 01:23:00,1538,"I know that it is blasphemy to say so, but I thought the original title of this thread was clever. This isn't like Gretzky getting traded people, come on. Jim"
484765,SBCregal,2010-07-12 21:05:00,688,"  if thats the case, maybe you shouldnt be traveling as fast as you possibly can.  glad everybody turned out okay.  ryan"
484768,HTHM,2010-07-12 21:22:00,4082,"Heck, I got schooled by JP's misfortune, what about you? So maybe JP is schoolin' all of us???"
484792,SRT8 smoker craft,2010-07-12 22:54:00,1107,Just curious how you know he wasn't wearing his killswitch I got tossed off a seadoo and the teather ripped off my lifejacket and the machine circled me untill I was able to swim to it with a busted up lifejacket slowing me down.J.P hope your OK
484794,Toronto_Angler,2010-07-12 23:21:00,698,I don't see anything funny about this at all. Its actually quite a serious situation and shouldnt be taken lightly in lieu of all the unfortuante incidents from this weekend. I'm glad he's ok.
484796,spinnerbaitking,2010-07-12 23:22:00,1622,"My partner & I were fishing & JP & Greg came along & we mentioned that the water was like 84 degrees & JP said that they knew they'd been swimming then he told us what happened & we both thought I don't think I'd be fishing the rest of the day but wow, there was a comment made later it was Greg's 1st tourney & maybe his 1st ride in a bass boat, one he'll never forget, JP can tell you the rest if he wants too, very glad every body seemed OK Richard"
484805,jedimaster,2010-07-12 23:45:00,3472,"Not a great weekend on the water at all. Having been in many Bass tournaments myself maybe its time for the bigger tourneys to consider  breaking the fields down and doing staggered starts, one off at a time like most clubs do. Its one thing to follow a wake its another thing to try and straddle a wake. Its very dangerous, for those that haven't been over 70 or 80 on the water its very hard to explain, but you are not only driving a boat you are flying a plane partially attatched to the water.  I too am surprised this doesn't happen more often. As for those of you who think just go slower. Thats never gonna happen. 50 boats idling with 200+HP under the hand, first to the best spot... Big money on the line... adrenaline etc.... this is one of those things where the organizers will need to take control, like manditory life jackets etc... There are rules in auto racin and essentially none in Bass Tourney's.  As long as more than one boat guns it at once off the line this will always be possible.  If you read this JP, hope you and Greg are ok. I would love to hear more about this and your reaction on your show or on a website one day once you shake the cob webs."
484814,spinnerbaitking,2010-07-13 00:10:00,1622," There was 3 flights of boats that were called out one boat at a time 1st 7am 2nd 7:15 & ours at 7:30 & you must have your life jacket on if the big motor is running or be dq'd, the boats that will go quicker obviously will catch & pass other boats & that will happen if your in a tourney or not, just watch the jet ski's, boats pulling skier or wake boards & throw in the wind to make things interesting, it was very unfortunate but at least they were OK, good lesson learned for many hopefully Richard"
484821,jedimaster,2010-07-13 00:24:00,3472,"Thats good to hear, not much more you can do than that. I have no idea even what series it is, but it sounds like they are doing well. Just gotta be careful. at high speeds or even moderate speeds crossing wakes, wind and everything involved boating is dangerous. Good to hear that they were ok. "
484823,mbac31,2010-07-13 00:42:00,904,I have been on boats since I was around 2 years old. I have taken courses and have a Captains licence as well from Commercial fishing. Yet I still got tossed out once on my bass boat. It does happen and it was from a rouge wave that was impossible to see. Not a fun  experience. Good to see that JP and his partner got out safe. Shows it can happen to the best of us. Basscats are not known for good slicing through water wakes.  By the sounds of it he seemed to handle it very well. Good on him. From what I can understand he had his tether switch attached and thats what stopped the boat quick.  This shows what type of character he has as well. To laugh and go fishing for the rest of the day tells me that he has schooled and tamed that boat. LMAO. He is at Icast I would assume and thats why he is not on here. He is about just as big as me and we hit the water like a sack full of sand. Lol.

484935,JPD,2010-07-13 13:12:00,296,"Hi everyone, I just arrived in Vegas yesterday afternoon and unfortunately had to receive several emails regarding this post. Thanks you to those who were concerned, everyone involved is doing great with the exception of a few bruises to the legs.. here is a post I made on the CBAF board yesterday before leaving:   I already know how much resentment there can be on this board for people with bass boats so I think I should explain the situation even though I shouldn't have to. Here are the facts from the horses mouth regarding the occurrence, not ""hear say"" from someone who never witnessed the incident at all...  1. I was passing my friend Doug when this occurred but not at full speed by any means... my boat is fully capable of running high 70's for speed and was only doing low 60's while crossing as I always do. 2. The boat hooking was the direct result of a rogue wave broadsiding us while crossing a series of 3 wakes left by another competitor, when we hit that wave it picked the nose of the boat up and we came down a bit off skew throwing the boat into a full hard left turn instantly... I have done this thousands of times in my life and never ended up with this result, ever! I have fished 2 tournaments with the Puma and passed probably 50 guys with no problems... just a freak occurrence is how I'm treating it. 3. Anyone who can joke about being whipped across the water at over 60 mph should think about the correlation of jumping out a car while on the 400 hwy series and think how much fun that would be... thankfully Greg and I landed well so we can joke about this. 4. This did not shatter either of us, we were in good spirits all day, fished the event and had a great day... what I did take from the day was a new respect of stuff that we can't control and realize that there is more of it out there than I thought when on the water. 5. Life jackets were on and I had forgot the kill switch on the motor but thankfully I have a Hotfoot in the boat which brings the boat to idle speed immediately when there is no pressure on it.  Again, thanks for all the well wishes from those who asked.. I'm in a meeting in 45 minutes... then busy filming all week, I'll try to pop in.  JP"
484939,Spiel,2010-07-13 13:24:00,9065,Thanks for taking the time JP to give us the facts. I'm pleased to know that both you and Greg have come out of this intact and in good spirits.  
484940,LucG,2010-07-13 13:26:00,779,"Glad to hear you OK JP!  Keep on fishing, and keep on filming!"
484942,Roy,2010-07-13 13:34:00,13728,Thanks JP.
484946,Spiel,2010-07-13 13:38:00,9065,"Just thought I might add for those that run big tillers like me that wearing your kill tether attatched to your life vest  does little good when you fall backwards towards the motor. I learned the hard way with what could have been fatal for me, I now strap the kill tether to my left wrist so that if my hand comes off the throttle the motor will (hopefully) cut out."
484959,hirk,2010-07-13 14:06:00,571,"Well put JP,I was gonna post on this yesterday and take the same tack as you.Many people on this board that don't run boats capable of 50mph + may assume that you were careless running your boat balls to the wall and got bit,this would be WRONG to assume as it can happen to a guy in a tinny with a 115hp just as easy.Accidents will always happen regardless of the amount of care taken to avoid them,thats why they are called accidents.What happened to JP has nothing to do with being reckless (I'm assuming JP:)) or the fact his boat runs fast so any tone in this thread implying he caused it or it shouldn't have happened because he's JP etc. is crap,anyone anytime can get wet."

484616,tightline,2010-07-12 13:32:00,322,"Was just chatting up a few friends of mine who were in the Dog Lake CBAF tourny on the weekend and heard a pretty interesting little tale.  Turns out JP Derose and the new BassCat weren't getting along to well!!!  The way I heard it is he was trying to pass another angler on the water, when the BassCat bounced sideways throwing him and his co-angler out of the boat at top speed!!!  My roomate who was there says everybody came out unharmed (by the grace of God) and the boat was recovered...guess JP wasn't wearing his kill switch tether  I just want to remind everybody to be safe out there it can happen to any of us anytime, I mean JP spends hours and hours on the water every week and wether it was bad luck or bad choices him and his co angler sure got lucky.

484697,BITEME,2010-07-12 17:58:00,1968,"  Dude I dont know what to say to this, I can tell you that a kill switch(tether) wouldnt have kept him in the boat. Im glad no one was hurt and they can fight another day. coming down sideways is like hitting a brick wall im glad they ejected clear  Peter"
484702,Lunkerhunter,2010-07-12 18:13:00,455,"yikes, that doesnt sound like much fun, i hope you are alright JP! same goes for your partner."
484707,Twocoda,2010-07-12 18:24:00,4130, Wonder where the second place dudes partner is ??
484708,tightline,2010-07-12 18:24:00,322," I wasn't calling out anyone, I was just saying if a guy like JP can have it happen it can happen to anyone. I wasn't at all making it personal nor do I feel the need to continue to rant about it."
484709,ohhenrygsr,2010-07-12 18:25:00,947,"Yes, As long as they are both ok that's what matters the most.  We are all human and make mistakes."
484710,tightline,2010-07-12 18:28:00,322, Same thing...wasn't calling out anyone...if it were Bob Iszumi or Chronzy or anyone else I would have posted as well
484716,mikeh,2010-07-12 18:51:00,824,"I agree, also I think using the title that you chose is a little tacky , I guess you thought it was funny when you typed it."
484717,SlowPoke,2010-07-12 18:53:00,2984," Bob and Daryl have a much lower center of gravity; not likely to be thrown out I think the important question that hasn't been asked is, is the boat okay? It surprises me that this doesn't happen more often. It's become as much of a race as it is a fishing derby! Let's go all the way with it; a Le Mans start with racers fishermen sprinting to thier tow vehicles and launching the boats (like Bronte at the begining of the GOSD only with better parking!). Hopefully this becomes a memory JP and Greg can laugh about and not a malady they'll be moaning about for years to come.  "
484734,ld17,2010-07-12 19:33:00,319,JP I hope your friend and you are ok.  We love what you do.  We all need to be careful out there.
484735,bassman,2010-07-12 19:33:00,384," It's a suiting and humorous title, and nobody got hurt. Tightline, thanks for reminding us about being safe and smart out on the water."
484738,danbouck,2010-07-12 19:40:00,4380,Glad nobody got hurt. J.P. will be able to use this experience to teach a lot of people about safety on the water.
484739,BillM,2010-07-12 19:43:00,17367,"Nothing wrong with having a laugh at someone else's expense once in a while  As long as JP and his partner are ok, I'm sure they'll be laughing at this also."
484744,misfish,2010-07-12 20:01:00,29133,"Wow hope your doing ok JP,and your partner aswell.  That must of been a scary ordeal. I hit a wake the wrong way on a blast off.Didnt go completely sideways,but close enough.Managed to save it. I had to regain my composure before heading off again.  Again, hope your both doing well."
484757,aniceguy,2010-07-12 20:38:00,1094,if someone can find humour in something very similiar to this then hey I dont get the joke  While Im sure it was no where as severe as  the video I ll wager it wasnt far off either  still funny?  
484759,misfish,2010-07-12 20:45:00,29133,  That was the vid that came to me right off the bat Milo.
484762,Fang,2010-07-12 20:50:00,1330,Anyone that has done a serious bass tourney or two can attest that even with a rolling start it's not always a smooth take off and clean water. Coming out of Hastings on Rice Lake was always my least favourite place and I'd be white knuckling it all the way. You never know how the water will react when boat wakes meet and you're caught between them.  Hope everything is all right for them.
