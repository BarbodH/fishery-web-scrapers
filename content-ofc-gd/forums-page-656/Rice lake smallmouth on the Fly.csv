485460,FlyGuy5,2010-07-15 12:35:00,101,Went out yesterday morning on Rice Lake.  I got on the water by 5:30am and was hoping to get a few fish on my fly rod as well I was gonna do some dropshotting and casts a few cranks.  I headed to the North shore and started throwning cranks in hope for some bass and walleye it was maybe 20 minutes before I boated my first walleye of the day.  Then after that I grabed my fly rod and start to work a top water mouse patteren.  I worked along the shore line for about 10 minutes and laid down a long cast which put my mouse right in front of a dock then stripped it in once making it pop in the water and bamm a smallmouth inhales it and the fight is on.  It was by far the best fight I've had this year with a bass.  I tell ya you haven't fought a bass till you do it on a fly rod!  After that I headed to the South shore to throw cranks in the chop and I was able to get a few more walleye one largemouth and a few bluegills...   Here are some pic's enjoy

485484,BillsTheBassMan,2010-07-15 14:26:00,932,"Awesome report Flyguy!  Thanks for sharing and thanks for all the pics!  I recently caught my first SMB on my first fly rod as well and despite the fact he was just a little pond bass, he put up an amazing battle.  I can't wait to hook into a 2-3lb river SMB, fighting him and the current, should be fun.  Do you use traditional bass bugs when you're flying for SMB?  How often do you nymph or use dries?  I have some mice as well and they do seem to get a lot of interest from both big browns and SMB.  Cheers, Ryan"
485500,FlyGuy5,2010-07-15 15:23:00,101,I mostly use poppers as well with crayfish patterns and minnow pattrens I don't use nymphs or dries but I should cause I know they would work as well with wolley buggers bass love leaches as well with walleye. here are some pics of flies I use.. The mouse pattren is tied on 2 hooks but the first hook is cut and braided line is attached to both hooks so now it swivels sorta walk the dog action.   
485506,BillsTheBassMan,2010-07-15 15:57:00,932,"I agree, buggers are definitely a good ticket with SMB.  Thanks for sharing again, I need to bolster my popper box and this should help.  Cheers"

I have pickerel in my freezer and can't even fillet them, because of my injured thumb!  Thanks for sharing."
