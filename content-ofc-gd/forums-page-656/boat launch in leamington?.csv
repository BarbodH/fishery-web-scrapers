486551,Bob Devine,2010-07-19 19:25:00,251," Leamington is a great port to fish and visit. Walleye fishing has been very good lately but it is a lot of water to cover for someone new to the area. Not sure where you are coming from but exit HWY #77 Leamington Exit head south all the way to Robson Road turn left(east) and you will find the marina located about 1/4 of a mile. Wheatley is another great location at this time for perch, walleye and rainbow trout. Fishing has been very goo there too with a short trip out on Lake Erie about 5-7 miles and you are in walleye and bow fishing country. Perch fishing has been very good close to shore.  http://www.leamington.ca/visitors/marina.asp Wheatley fishing reports: http://www.swoc.ca/forums/index.php"
