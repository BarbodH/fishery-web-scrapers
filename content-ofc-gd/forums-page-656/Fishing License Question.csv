486529,Zib,2010-07-19 18:05:00,369,I fish both Michigan & Ontario waters of Lake St. Clair & the Detroit River. I wanted to know if I had my wife on my boat but she wasn’t fishing (reading her book & getting some sun) do I need an Ontario fishing license for her? I would think she probably would need to have one but couldn’t find any info on the MNR website. Does anyone know or have a link to this info?  Thanks
