This is a custom smoker box I bought at the local delli. works great with chps or pellets. Good invstment for 25 bucks! Had it for 3 years now. Best part about them is, there is no cooking with aluminum foil.      "

486319,misfish,2010-07-18 22:33:00,29133,"Looking at that smoker box again,I could make that at the shop.I also need to have a drip tray, as the bottom of my BBQ is getting nasty."
486322,tb4me,2010-07-18 22:47:00,3295,yes they would be easy to make. the box itself is steel and the lid is stainless..you woudnt know it..I bet they would be easy to make.As for the pellets I only use them. I also use wood chips on top of the pellets.They seem provide enough heat in that box to smoke for a couple of hours. As I said earlier the foil pouches are not a good idea. When the aluminum burns the smoke sticks to the meat. I have heard that aluminum isint that good for cooking food
486390,Gerritt,2010-07-19 03:12:00,6129,Then dont burn the aluminum lol
486393,alexcba,2010-07-19 03:19:00,634,lol damn you all! these threads always leave me hungry..
486457,tb4me,2010-07-19 13:39:00,3295,That would be kinda hard considering the burning pellets or wood chips in the foil. Ill be doing a turkey next weekend that im looking forward too.
