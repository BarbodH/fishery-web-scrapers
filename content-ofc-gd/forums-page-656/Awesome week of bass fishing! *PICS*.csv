Something I havent done too much of for the past couple of years believe it or not.  I was supposed to have a guide in the afternoon but the group was concerned about weather with thunderstorms approaching.  The thunderstorms never came, but I got out anyways as I had a few groups out there this week and the largies were on fire!  Fished a 1/2oz Booyah Boo Jig in 14-26 feet of water and landed about 20 fish, mostly in the 3-4 pound range, great average size!!!  I tried to get a pic by myself but it turned out almost white (should have checked before I let them go).  I adjusted the settings the best I could to get this pic.   Tuesday, I had a group out for some largie fishing and we picked up where we left off.  This time, dropshot slammers and senkos on a splitshot rig did the trick.  It was actually a pretty slow day overall but we had a 2 hour period where the dinner bell rang and the fish were gorging!  Here's some happy clients!   Wednesday I fished a 17 boat club tournament on Gloucester Pool.  Our club has a 4 fish limit per angler (8 per boat).  I flipped a Strike King Rodent the entire day and managed 12.45lbs for my 4 which placed me 1st overall with big fish as well with a 4.45 pounder.  No complaints!  But then I got home and found out my bank card had been copied and someone withdrew just under 600 bucks in 3 seperate increments at 2:30am.  YAY!  Off to the bank to get that figured out!   Thursday I had a group doing an alcohol free bachelor party for their buddy.  They had driven up from Nova Scotia and wanted some nice Ontario bass!  I did what I could and put them onto a few.  The bite was much tougher than it had been the past few days out there, but throwing crankbaits around deeper weed/sand transitions put a few good fish in the boat.  Managed a couple smaller fish on stickworms as well.      Friday I took a couple up to Couchiching in search of some good bass, but the fishing was very tough!  It was only a 4 hour trip and although the perch were biting ferociously, the bass werent so hungry.  We managed 5 in the 1-2 pound range, nothing bigger.  Had smallies following the shadow from the boat but wouldnt touch a thing.  Such is life.  That's why they call it fishing, not catching! They were much happier than I was with the day, and I guess thats what counts!   Thanks for reading, hope you enjoyed!"

486056,Cudz,2010-07-17 14:38:00,2652,Good job steve. Nice job on the Glouster. Busy times for you.  Glad to see the guiding is working out.
486058,asdve23rveavwa,2010-07-17 14:44:00,2690,"Nice going Steve, some really chunky bass there!!!  The bank card thing really sucks, hope all got straightened out.  Take care, man!"
486082,Guest Johnny Bass,2010-07-17 19:02:00,0,Very nice. There must be alot of pressure on guides. But it looks like all your clients left with smiles!  I was expecting your next tournament to have better results after all the bad luck. Congrats.
486128,Leecher,2010-07-17 23:51:00,7832,Nice Steve     Congrats on the first place finish
486373,Dutch,2010-07-19 02:08:00,831,Good report - thanks a lot for sharing.
486414,steverowbotham,2010-07-19 11:23:00,1800, I was praying for better results after the string of bad luck.  Makes a big difference when you can fish confidently in your own boat haha.  Thanks for the kind words everyone!
486421,motion,2010-07-19 11:54:00,403,"Hey Steve. Too bad you didn’t repeat yesterday in the Juniors Mentor tournament out in Gloucester! LOL. Seriously though, thank-you for offering your boat, your time and your knowledge to the boys. It means a great deal these juniors (including my son).  It’s too bad that the Juniors may miss next week’s qualifier due to lack of boats. Let’s hope some others will step up to the plate and offer their help. (I've offered mine to help)  Thanks again!"
486440,solopaddler,2010-07-19 12:32:00,8605,"That's some good fishin' Steve. I'm not overly surprised, this long stretch of hot stable weather is just the ticket.  Hope you get your money back from the bank. The same thing happened to me a few years back and it was a bit of a hassle."
486456,steverowbotham,2010-07-19 13:36:00,1800," I think we'll get the number of boats out.  It's really important to get these kids out fishing, and I'm surprised by the lack of support.  I've been offering my boat for the past 6 years now, and will continue to do so.  Great program."
486463,motion,2010-07-19 13:59:00,403," As I said, I'm offering up my boat (and time) for this great cause. Let's face it, the kids are our future. I know you were a junior not long ago and certainly benefited from others helping out. Nice to see you return the favour.  My son (fishman2202) will be posting a request for boats on this forum. I hope some OFC members can help them prevent the cancellation of the qualifier next Sunday.  Cheers."
