485603,Cudz,2010-07-15 22:34:00,2652,I did not weigh this fish but I have caught several 5 pound smallies and this was everybit as big as some of those.  This is a big georgian bay specimen.  Incredible fishery there and there is so much good water it would take a lifetime just to fish a fraction of it. 
485608,Radnine,2010-07-15 22:56:00,1538,"Cudzy man, you should change your name to ""the Chameleon"", I have never seen a guy that changes his look as much as you do. You're not running are you? Smallies are unreal and I love them in big water. We caught five the other day on Erie (Tecumseh Reef) and the average weight was down a bit (less than four lbs) but we got a couple of slabs (no pictures = no report). Jim"
485610,Devious,2010-07-15 23:01:00,49,Beauty smallmouth! Id give it every bit of 5lbs and then some....
485615,Roy,2010-07-15 23:09:00,13728,"A beautiful smallie, Cudz! Congrats to you."
485618,camillj,2010-07-15 23:14:00,1988,Nice fatty ! (the Bass I mean )
485653,BillsTheBassMan,2010-07-16 00:59:00,932," You said it about G-Bay.  I know where I'm buying my cottage . . . that's for sure.  I was at Frying Pan Island all last week and there were some monster Bass . . .nothing smaller than 2lbs, average about 3lbs, and I saw twin 5lb SMB on a double header.  It's epic up there.  Nice fish and thanks for sharing"
485703,alexcba,2010-07-16 03:09:00,634,nice fish cudz!
485758,MCTFisher9120,2010-07-16 13:58:00,3761,"Nice bass man, beats my PB smallie for sure haha"
485765,Fishnwire,2010-07-16 14:23:00,983,  I hope you have a really good career going or are an heir to a good chunk of change because the property on the bay is out of the reach of most working people.
485771,BillM,2010-07-16 14:43:00,17367,I need to fish GBay a lot more
485931,Cudz,2010-07-17 00:54:00,2652,Me too Bill.  Only problem is I don't know it really well.  There are so many shoals and big bombs just below the surface that you really have to be careful.  In this pic we are about a mile from any shore but there were huge unmarked boulders literally 1-2ft under the surface.  Very cool but very scary if you don't know where they are and I don't have a gps
485948,OhioFisherman,2010-07-17 01:53:00,6623,"Nice fish cudz, they call that region the 30 thousand islands? they didn`t bother to count the 30 million rocks. 25 years or so of going to just one small area of the G/B, and it seemed every trip you could find new smallie spots."
485958,Guest Johnny Bass,2010-07-17 02:16:00,0,Nice! That smallie looks over 5lbs! GB has some monster bass. In the fall I used to smash some real monsters on the biggest husky jerks you can find.
485977,The Urban Fisherman,2010-07-17 03:10:00,2050,Beaty small man! I wish you didn't need such a big damn boat to get out to the toads we have out here on Erie! You guys are killin me with the small reports!
486121,Leecher,2010-07-17 23:24:00,7832,Nice hog Chris
