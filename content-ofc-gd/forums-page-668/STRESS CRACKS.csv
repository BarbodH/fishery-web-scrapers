477836,canadian_copper,2010-06-21 20:32:00,925,JUST LOOKIN AROUND AT THE MOMENT IN BASS BOATS. MY FRIENDS SELLIN A BEAUTY 21FT WITH A 250 ON IT. IN MINT CON AND ALL HE SAID IS IT HAS A FEW STRESS CRACKS ON IT??? NOW KNOWING NOTHING ABOUT BOATS IS THIS A NORMAL THING OR SOMETHIN TO BE CONCERNED ABOUT? TX FOR ANY INPUT.
477839,SlowPoke,2010-06-21 20:41:00,2984,A crack in the gel coat means the hull has flexed. Not uncommon. The downside is that moisture can enter and over time cause rot within the fibers. Every glass boat will have cracks in it; location and severity will determine the level of concern.
477840,aniceguy,2010-06-21 20:43:00,1094,scott what make and year is the boat?
477851,canadian_copper,2010-06-21 21:13:00,925,JUST SEEN PICS BUT GOIN OUT IN IT SOON. ITS A 2000 SPRINT I BELIEVE. 2000 FOR SURE I REMEMBER THAT PART  LOL
477876,fish_fishburn,2010-06-21 22:04:00,1311,Sprint bassboats are junk. Stay away from them is all I'm gonna say.
477878,Drew_10,2010-06-21 22:09:00,111," I wouldn't go as far to say their junk.  I've been in a lot of different types of bass boats, and to be honest, I found the ride in a 21 foot sprint with a 225 envinrude to be great and that was on Lake Erie.  Maybe not as smooth as my champion, but pretty good.  Just because they don't cost as much as a ranger or basscat or champion doesn't mean they're junk.  Just do your research and check out the forums on bassboatcentral.com for info."

477946,Garnet,2010-06-22 01:00:00,2056,I have a 1999 207 Sprint it's a work horse. Been in lot's of big water always got back. Doesn't like super skinny water. If you need any info pm me.
478032,RudeBuoy,2010-06-22 03:19:00,28,"As posted above, they're somewhat normal. The hull flexes and the gel coat will crack where it has been laid on too thick."
