So for my first muskie of 2010 I catch a pretty looking  cracker on a topwater bass lure.After a few hours of bass fishing I tell my buddy I want a real muskie so we try one of our spots and not even 5 minute(probably 5 casts )I catch my first fifty of 2010. Also caught the action on my hatcam. Ask buddy if he wants to keep muskie fishing ,he says no lets go back to bass,as he will get his muskie later.  "
