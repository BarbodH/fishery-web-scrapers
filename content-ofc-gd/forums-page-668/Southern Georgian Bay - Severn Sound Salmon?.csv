477476,myot,2010-06-20 14:36:00,131,Next to no salmon around but you can catch small lakers all day long Lack of bait is the big reason there are no salmon left Dan
477631,Canuck,2010-06-21 01:18:00,491,Are the lakers still the fin clipped stocked fish?  I used to catch them a lot in the same area and would keep one or two for the pan. I caught a few that were 10lbs plus and they were released.  100% all were fin clipped.
