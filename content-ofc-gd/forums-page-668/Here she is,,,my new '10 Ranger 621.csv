477696,JohnF,2010-06-21 13:23:00,3494,"Nice!  I'm struggling to come to terms with the new power to hull ratio standards. Back in the day when I played with boats 5 1/2 Johnsons were the norm for fishing and us kids and a 35 HP was a big deal, something we used for skiing. Obviously that was long ago.  I believe it was back in the late 80's I saw a kid with a 75 Horse tiller on an oversized rowboat rippin' & snortin' down in Ft.Myers and I thought that was pretty awesome. This whole 300 HP concept is a very bad thing for a guy who never outgrew his speed fixation. There's a reason my wife only lets me have normal vehicles these days. She says I act very undignified when I get near powertoys.  Again - very very nice. I doubt I'd ever shut it down to fish.  JF"
477805,linweir,2010-06-21 18:29:00,202,"Sweet ride! Although I prefer Lund type aluminum boat, Ranger 620/621 is only one of two fiberglass boats i will look for (another one is Boston Whaler). I think 57 mph makes sense if motor is 4 stroke, especially on choppy water."
471977,capt bruce,2010-06-02 20:21:00,820,"nice ride dude but you should be getting more speed , change of prop is in order but great ride , to quote my friend brian DROOL and double drool with a little ""why did I have 5 kids"" lol if you ever get lonely and need some company CALL ME ...."
471979,fishfarmer2,2010-06-02 20:22:00,76,Hey (Bud) did you win the {Loto} aaaaa

472007,Rich Clemens,2010-06-02 22:22:00,3131,That's simply awesome.
472010,spincast,2010-06-02 22:26:00,3279,ouch. Nice boat. Nice motor ... nice.......
472013,basskicker09,2010-06-02 22:33:00,144,nice boat just a little to slow for me
472029,MCTFisher9120,2010-06-02 23:20:00,3761,"wow...is that still considered a bass boat lol, 300hp man...incredable, how fast will it go?"
472031,irishfield,2010-06-02 23:24:00,26272,Did it come with belts Gav ???  
472059,Whitespinnerbait,2010-06-03 00:22:00,2038,  I'd say around 57 mph
472106,Gman,2010-06-03 02:42:00,126,"Thanks for the kind words guys. We're really excited to get out fishing in it.  Like others have also stated, Greg and his team @ DT Powersports along with Ranger were a pleasure to deal with, questions about whatever you could ask answered within 48 hours either by email or direct phone call - nothing short of impressive  Just working on putting the finishing touches on it over the next week or so, such as putting on the big clear plastic condom   aka chipguarding.  This is the same clear pressure sensitive adhesive which is applied to the front of your vehicle to protect & prevent stone chips; I'm having the hull from the water line up to and just over the inside of the gunnel done as well as both sides of the 300 cowling.  Then I've got some rod holders, Bert's tracks for the riggers at the back to install along with the wiring for riggers and last but not least both the HDS8's along with structure scan. The backbone of the network including shoot thru hull transducer has already been installed by Ranger @ the factory.  Also have a few more hours of break in to do.  Got a 14.5""x21P Pro Series on the way which from a friends experience in the US should allow us to hit approx 63 mph in the peak power range 5800-6000, which is quite impressive for essentially a 22' fiberglass hull.  It is very possible there will be an opportunity or two with an open seat for someone to join me/us for a fish either on Lake Ontario for kings or Erie for walleyes  .  I'll be sure to post back here under a separate thread.  I'll post more detailed pics once she's fulled rigged and fish ready to keep ya'll in the loop.  Cheers G."
472111,Dusky,2010-06-03 03:02:00,310,This is one sleek boat!! Congratulations!!
472156,canadadude,2010-06-03 13:25:00,769,"Thats the sweetest ride I've seen ever on any web site. Congrats, I just keep looking at the pics and drooling on my keyboard hahahahhaha"
477304,F_ast,2010-06-19 12:35:00,154,i saw you pulling that think through uxbridge the other day.  if it wasn't for seeing your big blue truck I would not have know.  Pretty sure I saw you on Tuedays this week though???  Nice rig
477310,Michael_Brown,2010-06-19 13:00:00,411,Great new ride.  Hopefully it has a large fuel tank so you can stop and top up your dodge between gas stations.
477311,lunkerbasshunter,2010-06-19 13:03:00,2585,wow a dream boat for sure!!!  enjoy her!
477320,pikehunter,2010-06-19 14:06:00,1659,"Sweet! What a shame to get it wet. Even more of a shame to get it slimed! Have some great tmes in it and catch many, many fish."
477337,Garnet,2010-06-19 15:23:00,2056,No way that boat was born and bread to go fishn. Got to go need to check my MAX ticket I NEED 2 SKEETERS one like yours and a bad a......s bass boat.
477346,rocket09,2010-06-19 15:59:00,18,
477480,thalweg,2010-06-20 15:05:00,112,What a beautiful boat.  Congratulations.  The 57m seems very slow to me for a 300hp.  I know guys with rangers and 250's and they top out around 75.  Yours looks heavier and maybe the deeper hull design offsets speed with a better rough water ride.  I would suspect with proper setup you should be able to at least touch 70 with that rig. I couldn't tell if it had a manual or auto jack plate?  Not that speed really matters when you're already in the 50's but I suspect that you're putting a lot of load on the engine.
477494,kickingfrog,2010-06-20 17:10:00,8333,Beautiful!!! I guess this was posted while I was on my mini fishing trip... in a 14ft tinny.
477503,spinnerbaitking,2010-06-20 18:07:00,1622,Sweet look'n ride there Gman have fun Richard
477507,Rattletrap2,2010-06-20 18:25:00,1652,Holy crap Gavin! This is my first time seeing your new baby! Almost too sweet for words!
477637,Gman,2010-06-21 01:51:00,126,"Thanks guys, it's been fun rigging her up to!  Want to make sure I get it right the first time.  Also been doing some testing with props - try to keep in mind this is a walleye style multi-species hull design for smooth rides on the big water no matter what you're chasing as opposed to a bass boat design.  Got her out for a shakedown fish this weekend, all went well.  Report of the rigging pics and shakedown fish to follow.  Cheers G."
477638,irishfield,2010-06-21 01:59:00,26272,Remember to take your Father for a spin.. .don't forget he taught you everything you know about fishing!!  Best boat partner I ever had... In the pissin down rain while you wimps was watching TV!  
477658,Cudz,2010-06-21 03:12:00,2652,"Hey Gman, Your rig is sweet! Were you driving southbound on the 400 today (sunday) at around 4 o'clock?  I saw a boat that looked very similar to yours."
471841,Gman,2010-06-02 13:01:00,126,"It's been a long anxious wait and when everyone was starting to hit the water this spring I thought I was really going to miss out - well it's been just the opposite!  The weather and wind were nuts on the big water till about 2 weeks ago. Actually, if there was a year to have any boat or motor arrive late this year would be it I would believe!  My boat arrived in early March, we’ve just been waiting on the newly redisgned 4.2L V6 Yamaha 300.  This motor went on a serious diet over the winter and shed something like 248 pounds and now weighs in @ 558#, where it previously came in at 806#.  It’s the lightest in it’s class.  Headed up to DT Powersports last weekend with dad and saw'er sitting there,  the newly re-designed 2010 Ranger 621, notice the deep V in the front of the hull, that's new for the '10 Ranger 621 this year and one of the reasons why I went with it.  On top of the wide gunnels specifically designed to accommodate a modular track system such as Bert’s Custome Tackle accessories.         Did what I needed to do and go the once over on everything then proudly trailered her home where she belongs, Milton   This is one well set-up rig, perfectly balanced, dual torsion axles, with oil bath hubs and 4 disc brakes makes trailering a breeze   Believe it or not even thou the complete set-up is almost double my previous set-up in weight I'm using 5L/100kms less in gas!  Yeah sure there's few difference as 4 tires are easier to roll than the previous 2, no windshield and the whole unit actually tucks in below the truck drastically reducing wind resistance.  Here she is parked at home attached to truck -    A shot of her big ass end -      The winch set-up, and convenient access step mounted to trailer for easy bow access, notice the trailer is essentially LINEX'd the with spray on ""truck bedliner"" -     Here's some a bunch of interior shots, some of which just don't do it justice -  The helm - if you ever have a chance to add in one of these trim swtiches, DO IT.  Never had one before there now I can' leave without it!    Down beside the helm, notice all the little creature comforts -    Port console -    The kicker pre-rig connection to main motor hydraulic steering.  This has got to be the slickest, sickest set-ups I've seen made of stainless, top notch all the way. It's on all the time, no more damn bar to put on and remove which eventually calcifies and rusts or rattles and drives you nuts -    The ""dance floor"" aka the trolling ""workstation"", all that is storage except for the horizontal area which is the livewell with Oxygenator system.  I've already removed the 2 extra seats as well as the removable casting platform and stored them in the basement    If you notice the rectangle in the floor of the last pic this is what it is, all 4 batters are placed in the center of the hull in efforts to balance out the boat, lower the center of gravity and make for smoother re-entry in to big water - just plain smart and frees up a load of storage space not to mention easy to access  The master power switch is mounted in there as well as the the switch to turn on the bow mount. This is same idea has been used in the 620 for the past couple of years, just smart!    The bow, all dry storage is sealed with a lip and a rubber gasket What we've got here is the large port and starboard storage spaces, the rod locker, live bait well on the starboard side and built in cooler on port side, all storage compartments contain white LED lights.     Got'er wet saturday around noon and put 5 hours on'er already, topped out @ 57mph @ 5200rpm with hammer down running a 14 7/8"" x 23 prop, gonna move down to a 14.5""x 21P  to increase rpm's as I should be pushing 5900 as redline is 6000. I was really impressed with the solid once piece feel of the boat as well as the responsiveness of the hull; never though I could pull as tight of a 180 switch back going 40mph that I did  That front keel just carves thru the water and makes it feel as if you’re on rails.  Took the boat in to get chipguarded this Monday morn so should be bring'er home again Thursday or Friday night, then it'll be time to mount both the HDS 8's and get started on the mounting of the riggers.  Main focus over the next week+ is going to be to get the boat rigged and ""fish ready"".  I’ll keep you updated with pics and the rigging progresses.  On a separate note, the knowledge and service I rec’d from Greg & his staff at DT Powersports was excellent.  They know all the in’s and out’s of these specialized fishing machines and know how to walk you thru the process and keep you informed every step of the way.  Cheers G."

471844,ecmilley,2010-06-02 13:11:00,2163,I' ve dealt with dt for some parts for my ranger and my yammy sled great people.  awesome boat the 6 series have been on my mind a while great all around boat. so need a fishing partner to help break it in? 
471846,Raf,2010-06-02 13:15:00,3495,Congrats Gavin!!  Really well designed/thought out.  I'm still going to pick your brain about a few things.. if I can tear you away from your new baby.
471847,CCM,2010-06-02 13:16:00,5,Nice Boat!  That'll be amazing for summer salmon on Lake O and fall eyes on Quinte.  I bought a bass boat from Greg at DT Powersports and the service has been great.
471850,lookinforwalleye,2010-06-02 13:20:00,4399,"Nice rig there bud I am sure your gonna love the way it fishes, the Yammy does looked trimmed down the first 300`s looked like a volkswagen.  I have found towing the same with my Stratos versus the Alumacraft the Stratos is far easier to launch and load and I get around 20-25% better fuel mileage with the tow vehicle.  Enjoy"

471976,darsky,2010-06-02 20:14:00,586,awesome boat but a 15 hp kicker may have been a better choice. You will have to throttle it some in current.
