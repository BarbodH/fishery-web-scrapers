475965,The Birdfish,2010-06-15 14:51:00,73,"Power Pro mossey green all the way. Used the product for the past 5 years with many different tests, spend a few extra bucks and go with the PP it will be worth it."
476020,Burning Babies,2010-06-15 17:28:00,150,"I've used original Fireline for years on my spinning tackle, with a lot of success.  I switched to Fireline Crystal a couple years ago, and so far, I'm finding it more durable.  I like Power Pro on my baitcasters, although I usually stick with mono or copolymer on those.  I had problems with breakoffs with Spiderwire Invisibraid, and Spiderwire Stealth doesn't seem to get along with the reels I'm using now (although it was fine with an Ambassador C4)."
476865,RudeBuoy,2010-06-17 23:23:00,28,"I'm not a huge fan of Power Pro, I find it hold too much water and your hands end up like Prunes. I like the Suffix Performance stuff and the Spiderthread is good too.  Most braids are made in the same plant - just treated differently."
476906,archie_james_c,2010-06-18 01:59:00,618,"Power Pro....nothing else compares. No memory, and tough as nails. I find 15 pound PP works well in pike territory (unless theres big gators around). No need for steel leaders and what not.  Fireline Crystal Fused is ok I suppose...tough and very easy to cut as opposed to PP, but as people said it's flat which makes it feel bulkier than Power Pro. a 125 yard 10 pound spool fills my Daiwa Tierra 2000 full...a 150 yard 10 pound spool of PP has room to spare...things to think about I guess."
476938,Fishnwire,2010-06-18 04:29:00,983,"Fireline Crystal is the only mainline I have used since I discovered it.  It's amazing...8 lb test bends hooks stuck in logs, but you need gloves to free snagged line because that stuff will cut your hands before it breaks. - I like a flouro leader about 150% the strength of my mainline (8lb test Firelire = 12lb test Seagar InvisX) and generally join the two with a good quality (that is important) ball-bearing swivel.  A double uni-knot works well if you need to forego the swivel. - The only thing I really don't like about Fireline is the price.  It's pretty freakin' expensive as far as I'm concerned.  $25 for a 125 yard spool?...that's borderline ridiculous.  I ordered a 1500 yard spool and it works out to half price.  Even still, I backfill my reels about a third with whatever crappy mono I have laying around before I fill 'em with the good stuff."
476944,ohhenrygsr,2010-06-18 04:47:00,947,Power Pro with Seagar leader is how i roll
477182,goteeboy,2010-06-18 23:12:00,175, Use the Double Uni Knot. Not two way swivel.  You'll chip your guides.
477186,JohnF,2010-06-18 23:32:00,3494, Yes. You will.  JF
477335,NANUK,2010-06-19 15:06:00,797,"Daiwa Samurai Braid, cost a lot more then Power pro but by for the best and smoothest braid available around here."
477347,canadadude,2010-06-19 16:02:00,769,Power pro red or green......I get it for $5.00 a 150 yd spool off a guy (I don't ask questions) so at that price I don't try other brands. Besides I really like the performance of Power pro it dosn't wind knot very often.
477392,[emailÂ protected],2010-06-19 20:15:00,15,"dyneema fiber braids are lengthy and straighter. They're also less slick then spectra fibers = better knot holds. Spectra fiber are spiraled and more round, most are made from combinations of kevlar and threads. Dyneema is made for spinning reels, and spectra braids are for bait casters. Fused braids are just dyneema fibers heated and made into a more uniform line, so that they are more line spectra fibre braids where there is a coating that smooths out the line. Fireline original on all my spinning reels Spiderwire moss green on baitcasting. Power Pro hi vis yellow is good for line watching - colour the first 8 feet green/black and its less visible."
477403,Fishnwire,2010-06-19 22:22:00,983,"  How long a leader do you use?  I like mine about two feet...I never reel in that much.  When I'm throwing casts I want at least that much line between my top eye and bait, when I store or transport my rods I use the hook keeper (5 to 6 feet of line), and even when landing a fish (with a net or by lip-locking) I don't reel that swivel in."
477420,lew,2010-06-20 00:22:00,12766,"If you like to use a 2 way swivel, like I do on my musky rods, you can get small plastic beads with a hole thru them that you can slide on your line before the swivel. When the  the plastic bead hits your guide insert it won't do any damage."
477467,eyefish,2010-06-20 12:22:00,135,  Spider Thread here (not spiderwire) no problems and seaguar red label for my leaders
477651,BillsTheBassMan,2010-06-21 02:56:00,932,"I've found that Power Pro and Spiderwire are both good braids and have served me well.  Power Pro says that their phantom red is the most invisible (even over their other colours), but as someone else said, if I'm worried about line visibility I tie on a leader.  You can practice the knots at home while relaxing or watching TV with old line from old reels of whatever you have laying around.  Don't turn your back completely on other lines.  Mono and Fluoro all have their purposes.  Sometimes a little stretch is a good thing, sometimes a more buoyant line is a good thing.  When I first started using braid, I was BRAID BRAID BRAID all the time, now I've learned to be a little more versatile.  Hope that helps, Ryan"
477661,GBW,2010-06-21 03:57:00,8460,huh? Just messing with ya. I just put 8lb triline xl on my wife's reel today from the 10lb power pro she had on and she loves it and can cast a lot farther.
475817,addymark,2010-06-15 00:41:00,69,"are the brands pretty even?  do the colours make a difference, or is it personal preference?"
475824,GBW,2010-06-15 00:52:00,8460,my vote is for Spiderwire as it's round and strong.  I use moss green but if it came in red (for a deep troll) then I would use red as well.
475825,backbay,2010-06-15 00:52:00,773,"If you fish real deep, then red can be a good choice. Apart from that, the rest of my line is ""Moss Green"" or somemthing like that, except for a blue spool of Sufix Fuse I've been using. Certainly, if you're using flouro leaders, it doesn't seem to make any difference; at least, not in my experience. "
475826,Syn,2010-06-15 00:56:00,519,"The colour wears off somewhat anyhow on most braided lines. If you have trouble seeing your line, yellow is a good choice. I like the green braid with a few feet of flourocarbon. There are ""clearish white"" braided siperlines such as Stren Microfuse, Spiderwire Invisibraid, and Berkley Fireline. Tempted to try them but my suffix braid has not been used yet this season (oh boy does the green wash off so easily)."
475828,ckrb2007,2010-06-15 00:57:00,449,"My preference is red power pro. Red is the first colour to ""disappear"" in the water column, followed by orange and yellow.....I believe at around 12-15ft."
475832,bronze_back,2010-06-15 01:03:00,17,The brands vary a lot in quality. I've tried many and IMO found that Sufix outperforms them all.
475836,alexcba,2010-06-15 01:06:00,634,"i just go with green. its awesome. 0 stretch, rip jigging machine lol"
475837,GBW,2010-06-15 01:07:00,8460,Garbage line!  like using dental floss...
475838,addymark,2010-06-15 01:07:00,69,"thanks for the quick replies. I was thinking mossy green colour but the red sounds like a good idea as well.  One more thing, when using the flourocarbon leaders, what knot do you use when tying to your line?  or can you tie it to a 2 way swivel?"
475840,BFSC Kevin,2010-06-15 01:15:00,1351,What happened to stren super braid?
475842,houski,2010-06-15 01:19:00,61,Why they stopped making it I'll never know. The new Sonic Braid sucks.
475848,Syn,2010-06-15 01:26:00,519," A nice ballbearing (my preference) swivel is a necessity especially if you are trolling inline spinners for pike/muskie, or worming for bass. Hell I pretty much use a swivel all the time except for some crankbaits and ultralight fishing with a cricket top water. Even spinner baits I am forced to use a swivel, because if it fouls up, the whole spinnerbait starts spinning.  The modified albright is a great knot for flouro to braid or the uni knot too. tying to swivel I'd use the doubled uni knot for the braid and the floro but I'm going to try the triple loop for the flouro because there is proof its a really strong for floro and it wastes less line when tying it.  Tying to the lure with flouro is another story. Looped knot for wobbling cranktbait, snell knot flipping in heavy cover punchbaits, triple loop knot worming. So it depends on the lure you are using imo."
475852,kickingfrog,2010-06-15 01:34:00,8333,"I haven't used dental floss for fishing, but I have used fireline. If you use it right, fire line is works fine. Newer versions of all the super lines are better than the previous generations.  As depth increases, the colour red ""disappears"" and the line shows black instead. Is that better??? No matter the colour of my braided line if I am worried about the line being visible I use a leader.  A swivel for joining a leader works but can be a pain if you're not careful (real it up to your tiptop guide and crack the guide). Two uni knots work very well. Many of the braids will have a guide inside the box for joining lines."
475865,fish-miester,2010-06-15 02:16:00,864,  I find it to work just as good as the Super braid. but normally just go with Power Pro
475868,LegitFish,2010-06-15 02:22:00,69,"I just recently picked up Spiderwire Camo, looks pretty cool, have yet to try it yet though."
475878,Syn,2010-06-15 02:43:00,519,btw remember to put some electrical tape (not on the inner arbor walls) or the foam tape they include in the braid line box or else your line may slip on the spool when you hook a good size fish.
475883,Sudzy,2010-06-15 02:53:00,88,"I just switched from all mono to the Spiderwire Invisibraid.  Great line, dont think I will going back to mono anytime soon, big difference."
475891,EC1,2010-06-15 03:49:00,930,"One line that seems to never get the mention is Tuf Line XP. I love that stuff, and it's a fair bit cheaper than PowerPro.  Then, you can even go on to trying Daiwa Samurai Braid, and Fireline Braid. For Fireline Braid, buy 30#+, from that weight and above, it is super  smooth. Only problem was that they did knot easy when fishing it on a windy day.  I just got some InvisiBraid too. And don't listen to the package about it being translucent...I don't buy it a single bit. But anyone who buys braid knows that they are sacrificing visibility for strength. The white braid looks awesome though"
475904,pigless,2010-06-15 05:52:00,22,"You'll probably also want to look into flat braids vs. round braids and ""fused"" vs. ""braided"". I find that the flat braids (Fireline I believe is flat) don't work as well on baitcasters. I tried Fireline crystal on one of my baitcasters one time and it kept digging into the spool and then breaking off. Switched over to a round braid and haven't had an issue since. Also, I find the ""fused"" lines are usually the ones that end up like dental floss as each strand begins to separate after a while."
475918,Garnet,2010-06-15 10:39:00,2056,Spider Thread it's round no wax coat and very compact. Also Canadian Company.
475926,mbosh1980,2010-06-15 11:32:00,349,I thought the sufix was garbage! 30# was thicker than #50 fireline and very stiff.  I like powerpro now a lot better than when it first came out. If you are looking for a supple line try the camo braid! I also like the alternating colours as it makes it easy to spot if a fish it taking line if I have wandered away from my setup while carping.
475936,lew,2010-06-15 12:24:00,12766,I've been using Power Pro on all my rods for quite a few years now and have never found a reason to switch to anything else.  It's never failed me or caused any problems.
475939,GBW,2010-06-15 12:46:00,8460,"It's okay line but the main ""stealth"" braided line is better IMO."
475946,Raf,2010-06-15 13:31:00,3495,"power pro and tuff line for me  the red lines are nothing but a gimmick - they don't disappear, they are just the first to turn grey/black.   suckers."
475951,Toddyc20,2010-06-15 13:50:00,141,I use Spiderwire stealth on almost all of my rods.  From 15 lb on some of my bass gear all the way up to 80lb on my muskie gear.  All of it is very very strong and i've never had a problem with it.  I recently put some invisibraid on my newest reel and have been catching fish at a good rate with no problems.  I find that everyone will have a different opinion.  Just try two or three kinds out over the years and you will find one you like best.  My brother always uses powerpro and i don't think he'll ever change to anything else.  All personal preference.
