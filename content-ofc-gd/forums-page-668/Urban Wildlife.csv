477281,laszlo,2010-06-19 11:06:00,487,"As I'm drinking my morning coffee, sitting at my computer before I go to work, I look out the window facing the ravine (Humber) behind my house.  Out of the corner of my eye I see some movement. What do I see...a doe grazing on the hill with her tiny fawn running all around her. Awesome! And this is just 20 minutes from downtown Toronto (HWY 27 / Rexdale).  After 3 years here, that's the first fawn I've seen."

He's having a tough time maintaining a lodge because some of the shore 'fishermen' (I use that term loosely   ) steal wood from it to build fires in the wintertime:    And a little explorer near the beaver lodge, mama wasn't around but I'm sure she found him later:  "
477324,DRIFTER_016,2010-06-19 14:30:00,10439,"Well my city has tons of wild life. In the three years I have been here I've had Black Bears, Grizzly Bears, Cougar, Lynx, Wolverine, Coyotes and Foxes in my neighbourhood. There's a fox den at the foot of my driveway that had ma, pa and 10 kits in it this spring. They moved out during the thaw due to flooding and have moved to a drier spot two doors down."

477406,BillsTheBassMan,2010-06-19 22:33:00,932,"Yep, an old pair of shoes and a warm coat for the bum might go a long way to helping somebody out.  Great pictures Dave Bailey!  Wildlife is one of fishing's greatest compliments.  Always a treat to see something ""different.""  Plus, the beaver jokes (when you're talking about an actual beaver) can throw your women into fits:  ""She was just down by the river, au naturale.""  ""She was mostly just trolling for wood.""  It gets worse, so I'll stop before I go into the unshaven quotes"
477414,bassman87,2010-06-19 23:57:00,586,"please stop calling the homeless ""bums"". i volunteer at a shelter and when you get to know them and hear what they have gone through that name for them really gets under your skin. thanks"

477460,gdelongchamp,2010-06-20 09:23:00,199,I live in downtown Sudbury. A few years ago while my wife and I are sitting in the back yard a mallard duck landed on the middle of the lawn. The nearest lake is Ramsey about 1/2 mile away.  Three years ago two bears were in the tree across the street from our house. One climbed down and ran away the other was put to sleep and moved out of the area.  Three nights ago two adult moose trotted by the front of our house while my two girls were standing outside wondering why there were police cars and roadblocks all over the place.
477463,laszlo,2010-06-20 10:55:00,487," I take my dog for a walk almost everyday back in the ravine. I know exactly where your talking about. In the winter they are everywhere! A few months back I saw a group of 9.  I see coyote scat back there all the time but have yet to see or hear one. With the million rabbits, groudhogs and squirrels back there you think you'd see them from time to time.  Less common species I've seen back there are:  Green Heron Great Horned Owl Mink Orioles"
477479,alexcba,2010-06-20 15:05:00,634, a horned owl? thats awesome i havent seen one of those in years.. you live in one of the nicest places in the city bro.
