473793,pikeguy,2010-06-08 21:25:00,195,"Hi every body. If there is any of yous who would like bait but do not wish to haul it up with you.  I will be there on Thursday and i set it up with my friend who owns a bait and tackle shop, Just call him or e-mail him and he will get it ready and i will pick it up and bring it for payment you can ether pay for it when you order or we can make some kind of arrangement,just let me know  phon #(705)674-6113 	fax # (705)674-7915  e-mail,- [email protected] 	or [email protected]   it is only 45 min for me so it will not be a problem"
474748,Big Cliff,2010-06-11 09:29:00,6899," I was wondering how that worked out for you? Did you get the starter fixed? I got thinking after you left that we should have pulled it apart, it might have only needed a new set of brushes. Also, was I right about the output from the charging coil? A schematic would have sure simplified things.  Lastly, where I told you to put that grommet. If you are having trouble finding one to fit, just take a piece of fuel line, cut it lengthways down one side and that will do the trick. Let me know if you need some, I'll bring it up to Lakair and drop it off when I make my quick appearance on the Saturday."
474751,Big Cliff,2010-06-11 09:40:00,6899," Saddly work is getting in the way and Sue and I can't make it for the weekend. I am going to drive up on the Friday right after I get off work, spend the night at my daughters Friday night, be at the camp bright and early Saturday morning but I'll have to leave early Saturday afternoon."
