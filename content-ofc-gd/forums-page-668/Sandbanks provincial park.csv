477768,BFSC Kevin,2010-06-21 16:58:00,1351,Later on this week I will be camping at sandbanks and I'm looking for some help... How are the boat ramps there? good solid concrete? dirt? I only have a caravan.... How is the fishing? East vs West Lake? Probably will try for some eyes/pike before bass opener. Any tips in general?  Thanks

477818,PERCHER,2010-06-21 19:31:00,787,Kevin the river gonefishn is reffering to is the outlet.If you need any info on east Lake send me a p.m.I fished that lake for 10 years. Dan
477877,Rizzo,2010-06-21 22:07:00,4754,"east lake for numbers. when you get bored of that, try west lake where the numbers are still very good but fish tend to be a bit bigger"
477879,BFSC Kevin,2010-06-21 22:14:00,1351,Walleye? pike? bass?  How are the ramps? nice and solid concrete?  thanks!

You'll pass it on the way to Sandbanks. I'm sure there are places much closer to the park to launch into west lake as there are several private campgrounds in the area. 15 years ago lots of places to launch for east lake too. Several along the outlet river, including 2 that were in the provincial park. As I recall, the ones in the park weren't great but that's a long time ago"
