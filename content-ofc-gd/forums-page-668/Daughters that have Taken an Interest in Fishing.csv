476728,laszlo,2010-06-17 11:31:00,487,5 months ago my wife Anna and I had our first baby. I'm really looking forward to teaching her about the outdoors and fishing. I know girls generally don't have as much of an interest in angling as boys do.  Which of you moms and dads have daughters that love to fish???   Eliana 'Poops' Csordas...      
476730,bridge,2010-06-17 11:39:00,54,My Daughters three now and she loves fishing.  I've been taking her out for minnows and sunfish and such since last spring summer.  She also loves camping(probably more then I do).  She is always asking if we're going camping.  She has also done quit well at catching snakes and frogs and now has a pet turtle.  The only thing she doesn't seem to like is worms.  She does all this with me but is still the girlie girl when she's hanging out with mommy.
476731,splashhopper,2010-06-17 11:42:00,2931,"GREAT pics of your daughter.  Excellent topic to start the summer off with too btw.   Started my daughter fishing at age 10 (wish I had started the year before when I got back in to it)  She loves bringing her friends with her too.   It doesn't matter what kind of fish she catches,, as long as she ""beats dad"" in numbers ...lol   The following was THE fish that got her hooked on fishing. It was her first 5 minutes of fishing ever. The real pressure came when her hand was being hurt( note splint on her left hand) from the weight of this brute and she says: ""don't lose it daddy, it's my first fish""   This summer we are planning her first canoe fishing expedition on my favourite ""lake X""."

476741,bow slayer,2010-06-17 12:40:00,1074,My daughter is 13 now and loves fishing. On our yearly camping trips to Restoule she gets up early in the mornings to wade out from the back of our site and throw top waters for bass while I sit in my chair and drink my morning tea.
476752,Handlebarz,2010-06-17 13:14:00,3790,my daughter loves to fish and she has become a musky addict here are a couple shots of us with her musky's and yes she brings them in on her own she also likes to cast for them but has not had one hit when casting.              and she is not afraid to fish for others also 
476757,bigbuck,2010-06-17 13:39:00,2449,"MikeP, nice to see your daughter fishes for some bait too....LOL My 2 daughters love to fish off the dock for sunfish and perch. They fill up a bucket with water and fill it with fish that they can spend hours amusing themselves. My oldest who is 5 was my little fishing partner up on LOTW 2years ago on some musky hunting expeditions. We'd go out for a couple of hours and wouldn't spend too much time fishing, she had eyes like a hawk and saw deer, bear, foxes, wolves, eagles...... Fishing with your kids is a great way to spend quality time, I'd argue the best way but that's just me. Don't be too serious and just enjoy the time on the water."
476761,uglyfish,2010-06-17 13:47:00,981,"i have a 5 year old daughter that loves fishing. always asks me to go. my gf is due with another girl july 5th. i promise by the time summer is over, she'll have had her first fishing trip! haha"

476855,mbac31,2010-06-17 22:51:00,904,"My 16 month old Daughter (Rylea) is in training. I love being a Dad, its awesome. Tought at first but will love it hopefully. 6 monts old they kinda give you the same stare back as the fish"
476870,irishfield,2010-06-17 23:38:00,26272,Our daughters have always been my fishing partners. When camping... the night before we'd decide who was going out first thing in the am and we would set our clothes outside the door so we didn't wake up the others. A daughter and I would get out for about 4 hours before coming in for breakfast.. then I'd go back out with both daughters. Son (oldest) would still be in bed when we came back for lunch. I think I've had him fishing about 5 times in his life... the gals... 100's and 100's of times.  Sometime in the mid '90's.. Martin River PPark. Both girls in the boat..    Last summer.. not afraid of a bit of slim and blood.. lol    Kristal freaking out her young cousins..    Man.. look how high that water is and that was July 31st !!  ..and cleaning her boyfriends catch..  
476897,paulyboy83,2010-06-18 01:33:00,54,"Great topic!  My first child is due the end of July.  Just happens to be a little girl coming our way.  I have already told my wife, as soon as the baby is old enough to hold up her head on her own I'm sticking her in the carrier and taking her to the river to do some casting!  She thinks I'm a bit nuts but knows there is no stopping me.  I figure I can inundate her with the smells, sounds and sights at an early age and have a great fishing partner for a long time!  PB"
476926,spinnerbaitking,2010-06-18 02:46:00,1622,Can't wait to get her out this year for bass they'll be home for the long weekend in July My 3 yr old Grand daughter showing her cousin how it's done
476953,Teressa,2010-06-18 10:30:00,55,"I've been taking my daughter fishing with me since she could walk. One way my Mom & I got her interested was when it was time to clean the fish, she would get to check what the fish ate. She always felt sorry for the worms when we put them on the hooks, but the curiosity of what was in their stomach over came that. She is going to be 15 years old next month and she has told me that any boyfriend she has will have to like fishing and camping as much as she does.  "
477135,bigugli,2010-06-18 20:55:00,6138,Love having the apple of my eye as a fishing partner. She's also good at putting her boyfriends to shame on a regular basis.   Seems she got the knack from her Baba. 
477511,Leecher,2010-06-20 18:36:00,7832,"Great topic Laszlo I got my daughter hooked on fishing when she was 5..... Back at my sister's cottage.... she caught her biggest small mouth bass on my ultra light 4 1/2' rod.... live bait was the ticket for that one..... leeches that is    setup wacky style...    We don't go out often but the times spent together are priceless   and truly enjoy them..... she usually kicks my butt too  A couple of pics on the hard stuff  14"" Perch    Another jumbo    I think little girls are just as much interested in fishing then boys..... just got to expose them to fishing at an early age Heck now when I come home with some fish for the pan.... she wants to know what is the stomach content and show her Leechman"
