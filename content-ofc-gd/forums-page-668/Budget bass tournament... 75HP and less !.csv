So I was thinking of organizing a small 75HP and under bass tourney. Open to any age group... I dont know if it should be a single angler entry or a team entry ??? what do you think ? I only wanted to make it a $50 entry to keep it in the budget for most people !!! It can be any style of boat, just a max of 75 horse power. 3 fish limit / Big fish pot ($10)... Bass only Fish must be alive at weigh in which means your boat has to have some sort of livewell rigged up... a bucket with an aeroater would make a good livewell... and with only a 3 fish limit... it doesnt have to be huge  We can do a 7am-noon or....3pm-dark.. time limit ??? or even a full day, 7am-2/3 PM ??? Im not sure.. I guess i need feedback on that. I dont want to make this a PRO style tournament.... just something for the smaller boat guys and girls to get out and enjoy some competitive fishing. I wanted to make this on opening day in Rondeau Bay, I do not think there is any other tournaments going on in Rondeau opening weekend !  Well what does everyone think ????? any comments suggestions are welcome....  My phone number is 519-365-0127 ...shoot me a txt or give me a call for information.   Thanks .....Tyler"

478146,troutologist,2010-06-22 14:58:00,951, Agreed and also I believe you require a permit from MNR (not certain of the details)
