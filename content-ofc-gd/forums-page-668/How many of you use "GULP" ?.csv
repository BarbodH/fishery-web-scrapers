477130,fish_fishburn,2010-06-18 20:43:00,1311,"I get minnows at my local tackle shop for free, only thing is there dead.  So I take em home and salt them put 2 or 3 dozen in a ziplock sandwich bag and away I go. Works just as good as GULP. But GULP is an awesome product use it all the time. Salted minnows on a jig and twister tail fool those walters all the time. By the way the minnows I get are free."
477138,bigugli,2010-06-18 21:06:00,6138,"Gulp fry have been deadly with panfish, but I've not had great success with their minnows. My garlic salties work better."
477164,JohnF,2010-06-18 22:23:00,3494, Jeez. They've figgered out to breed 'em now. How's that for really lifelike?  JF

477193,backbay,2010-06-19 00:24:00,773,Love the stuff for bass. I use the 5 inch leeches.
477211,fish-miester,2010-06-19 01:52:00,864,HAHAHA ! thats funny!   5'' Leeches work great for Walleye too skin hooked on a jig head/nuckel ball jig
477216,vinnimon,2010-06-19 02:03:00,2593,you didnt know? can be done very easily at home!pm me and i will send you the recipe.
477220,SRT8 smoker craft,2010-06-19 02:18:00,1107," Yeah I hear people complaining about them leaking all the time but have never had a problem and then I realized it was because I left the foam/foil stuff attached and only peeled it back half way seals the lid completly I have a tub of 5"" jerk shads that have been bouncing around in the boat for a couple years without leaking a drop I only use them for a trailer on buck tails for pike when the bite slows down so I don't go through very many but it's getting low so I have bought some packages and tossed them in the sauce so now I have a assorted bucket can't wait to toss some leeches to the smallies on LPB next weekend."
477230,Bondar,2010-06-19 02:56:00,817,   hate the stuff never use it
477234,bassman87,2010-06-19 03:09:00,586, cool mardi gras beads bro
477237,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2010-06-19 03:13:00,0,"in certain applications they are unbeatable.  i have used them for walleye, lake trout and atlantics with success and see no reason why they wouldn't be equally as effective on any piscivorous predator."
477238,Bondar,2010-06-19 03:14:00,817,   actually i use em for tying bunny jigs and stuff but yea hahahah ya cuaght me been walking the streets flashing people
477249,fish-miester,2010-06-19 04:32:00,864,   ya I can really tell! it hasnt even been opened.. jeez.. I guess if ya want I can take it off your hands..
477262,pikehunter,2010-06-19 08:36:00,1659," Get a battery operated air pump and your live minnows will stay that way although 12 hours is a stretch. As for Gulp Alive, haven't tried it. Gulp in the bag does work that I know."
477272,wormdunker,2010-06-19 10:35:00,1711,"I use gulp alive for perch & crappies, very successful.  I must admit I always buy minnows.  If the bite is good I'll switch to gulp alive, the bite may slow down a bit, but, I still catch fish.  If the bite is slow I'll use live minnows & gulp alive to see what is working.  They do have a problem of leaking smelly juice in the boat so I store the small bottles of 1"" & 2"" minnows in a sealed tupperware container.  Also put some of my other small plastics in the jar of gulp juice."
477307,Fishnwire,2010-06-19 12:48:00,983,"How are you handling/storing your live bait?  You probably are doing everything right, but just to be sure...Leave your minnows sealed up with oxygen in the bag from the baitstore until the last possible minute.  Keep it out of the sun and cool until you get to the lake.  Once there, transfer your minnows into a decent trolling bucket and keep them in the lake as much as possible.  When the bite is on and you're in there every few minutes, it's tempting to leave them on the deck of the boat.  A half an hour in the hot sun is all it takes sometimes to start killing 'em. - Sorry if I'm telling you stuff you already know."
477492,fish-miester,2010-06-20 17:03:00,864,If and when I use minnows whether its ice fishing or walleye fishing and I dont have an airator 90% of the time I throw a 2''layer of Snow or multiple packed snow balls in the bag/ bucket. Ice works. and as the snow/ice melts it releases oxygen.. a good fishing partner taught me that (my Grandpa) and well I'll be honest when I show up to the fishin hole with my 1-2 dozen minnows in my little garbage pail they are all still alive.. where as my buddies who have a minnow bucket/airator theres are all half dead! and well thats why I prefer to buy the minnows !  but now that I have learned and experienced the gulp products I normally dont buy to many minnows.. mostly for ice fishing (tip ups/and simcoe pin heads) and the odd trip up north just north of Sudbury. just so that the local boys dont chirp me to much on using gulp over live bait
477664,SlowPoke,2010-06-21 05:01:00,2984,"I don't use soft plastics often but when I do, it's Gulp Alive. My biggest complaint is storing them but it seems Berkley has comme up with a solution. A Gulp Alive storage tray that will fit into tackle bags/boxes much like a Plano 3700. It has a double seal and just survived 1100KM trip in the car and a boat ride without losing a drop while being store on end. It does work.    Two tips for you; Just when you think it's closed, it's not. It has a double seal. Snap the lid closed firmly all the way around and really push hard to make that second seal. If you just want one of the compartments, the snap out from the back of the tray.  They're not cheap at $18 but neither is Gulp Alive. Protect your investment."
477666,alexcba,2010-06-21 05:05:00,634,thats awesome. lol the warnings about the leaking paid off. had some plastic jars i dumped them in there with the juice.
477680,lookinforwalleye,2010-06-21 12:20:00,4399, Be nice if they provided a non leaking container for the product in the first place!
477684,JohnF,2010-06-21 12:42:00,3494, So how long from breeding to breading. I'd think you'd want to grow 'em up a bit to make the eating worthwhile?  JF
477707,canadadude,2010-06-21 13:56:00,769,"Thats a sweet box for your gulps, worth every cent if you ask me,not only does it protect your baits but you have a nice seletion all in one convient box.It sure beats having to tote around multiple jars and tubs"
477714,fish-miester,2010-06-21 14:33:00,864,  agreed ! I have been eye-balling these for a while now.. and Im thinking its about time to pick one up
476866,alexcba,2010-06-17 23:31:00,634,i've used it once with some success and im thinking about loading up on some. i fished it vertical in about 20FOW on a jig. what are your opinions if any on it? i know i can check out vids on youtube about it but id rather hear it from this community.
476869,Guest Johnny Bass,2010-06-17 23:33:00,0,My opinion is that it is the closest thing to live bait. The only thing is that if left out for too long they get really hard and they can get expensive.
476871,Handlebarz,2010-06-17 23:42:00,3790,I LOVE GULP there I said it again if I am fishing for anything other then musky I will use gulp as it works and has helped me out fish many boat partners I have also lost a few pails over the years leaving them in others boats and when I get them back they are empty or I just don't get them back but I know they were well used.
476872,Fisherman,2010-06-17 23:45:00,7201,"Tried it a couple times in the winter and spring, I might as well be throwing a smoked ham in front of a chicken. Zero bites."
476873,alexcba,2010-06-17 23:47:00,634,lol awesome.. looks like bass pro here i come AGAIN!  does the spray on attractant have decent penetration on hard baits? i used to use the squeeze based thick viscosity ones but found i was reapplying alot of the time.
476874,fish_finder,2010-06-17 23:47:00,370,I use gulp on whiskey and beer.....
476875,alexcba,2010-06-17 23:48:00,634,LOL! or do you GULP whiskey and beer?
476881,Paully,2010-06-18 00:27:00,712,I bought 2 dozen minnows last weekend and they all died on me within 12 hours. I changed the water a few times but it did not help any. I would also like to hear others input on gulp..Its the same price as 2 dozen minnows
476882,Handlebarz,2010-06-18 00:28:00,3790,m ygulp minnows from two years ago still look as good as the day I bought them
476886,Toddyc20,2010-06-18 00:48:00,141,I have a pail of leeches and used one so far and it was last summer.  I put an octopus hook through one end and threw it out weightless.  Within 2 minutes my line started moving.  Ended up being a decent 3-3.5 lb largemouth.  In my opinion it works.
476889,fish-miester,2010-06-18 01:05:00,864,"the styles I have used have worked great for me, (Leeches, minnows, jerk shads, minnow grubs)  .. and lets just say i baught my gf a tub of the minnow grubs cuz thats one of the only baits she likes to use.. cuz well it normally always produces"
476899,troutboy,2010-06-18 01:36:00,125,"Gulp or power bait leeches work great for eye's.I still prefer live bait,but I keep a few packs around incase of bait shortage.I found out last summer that white scented grubs on a walleye lindy spinner work amazing."
476909,kickingfrog,2010-06-18 02:04:00,8333,"Gulp and Gulp alive are my first choices when I'm using soft plastics, and I haven't bothered with live bait for years."
476929,alexcba,2010-06-18 03:23:00,634,thanks for all the input guys. i'll be headin out to bass pro in the morning to pick up the alive ones.
476934,timmeh,2010-06-18 03:55:00,609,"IMO it's the action that the angler puts on the bait that is much more important than what brand it is. I've caught fish on gulp and will include it in my arsenal for bass this year, but it's not my preferred choice and I've done just as well on other brands of soft plastics.  I know they say it outfishes live bait but I'll never believe that. No matter how much scent or attractant you put on a bait you can never reproduce the behavior of live bait. I still very rarely use live bait, but that is for different reasons."
476942,Fishnwire,2010-06-18 04:44:00,983,"I'll probably always want live bait when I'm ice fishing...but in the summer, I have no use for it.  I haven't really used GULP! but I know that my Power Bait lizards, worms, chiggers and tubes get hammered by the smallies I go after.  Also soft plastic doesn't die, it doesn't have to be kept cool, it doesn't require water changes and takes up way less space.  Live bait is an enormous pain in the butt, compared to soft plastic."
476946,BillsTheBassMan,2010-06-18 04:58:00,932,"Yep, fish see more than they smell and action is more important than attractant most certainly.  You can do fine with power bait, gulp, other brands of tubes, yum, bass magnet - any form of soft plastic like that.  Where I like added attractant is in Senkos - the Yamasenkos are the best because of their obscenely high density of salt impregnation which gives them that ""drop"" action that causes so many strikes.  The scent does come into play in one regard - I feel it helps the fish hold onto the bait for a little bit longer than an unscented bait.  Gulp definitely has a good organic scent about it.  I've had decent success with it on the occasions that I have fished it, but I don't really find it outfishes other soft plastics, and definitely not live bait (but live bait is more of an inconvenience).  Id pick up a few, but I wouldn't go overboard.  Spread it out over a few brands and see what you like."
476973,Fishmaster,2010-06-18 13:02:00,920,Im not a fan of leaky buckets and a bait that goes hard in the sun ...Live Bait for me works much better then the Gulp crap
476982,canadadude,2010-06-18 13:26:00,769,"I agree with leaky buckets and jars,I know the stuff works but it drives me nuts with the stinky leaky containers.......still live bait works better for me aswell"
476987,BillsTheBassMan,2010-06-18 13:33:00,932,"Yep, a leaky bucket of gulp can make any surrounding tackle a mess in a hurry.  It can be pretty disgusting."
476991,southpaw24,2010-06-18 13:38:00,32,"im not a fan of gulps, live bait is so much better IMO. i go down to shore and outfish the americans that come up with their fancy lures with my minnows."
477008,mepps,2010-06-18 14:41:00,1301,GULP sinking minnows are one of my all time favorites! Great for bass all season long IMO.
477033,fish-miester,2010-06-18 16:06:00,864,as for the leaky containers I normally cut out a small X on the seal just big enough for me to pull a bait or two out.. and then put an elastic band around the bottom of the threads on the container seems to work well.. havnt really had any problems since! or you could store them In containers such as small peanut butter jars.. that dont leak. thats another thing I do  but hey.. what would I know ? haha
477075,canadadude,2010-06-18 18:41:00,769,"Thanks, I'll try that....normally the smaller jars I use ice fishing were leaking. I like the baits the mess was upsetting"
477088,Syn,2010-06-18 19:03:00,519," Man that is a good tip . You are like that smart velociraptor in Jurassic Park that outwits the hunter who says ""clever girl"" before he gets eaten alive. Except you're a guy and human."
