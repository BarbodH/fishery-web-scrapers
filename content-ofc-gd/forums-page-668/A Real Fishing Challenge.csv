477473,Fish Farmer,2010-06-20 14:04:00,2234,With all the White Fish in lake Erie. You don't hear anyone catching them by angling. Would be nice to hear that some have been caught by rod and reel. Would take the pressure off L. Simcoe. Are they possible to catch? Would you jig for them as Simcoe? Who would target them? Anyone have some thoughts on this?
