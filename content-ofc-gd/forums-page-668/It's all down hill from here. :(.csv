Unfortunately it also signals a time when the days are going to get shorter until there is way more dark than light and temps drop to -60. Today 3 hours and 59 minutes of dark, December 21st, 3 hours and 59 minutes of light.    But there is good news. With every passing day the time until my yearly Alaskan vacation is that much closer. T minus 76 days and counting!!!"

477955,Slop,2010-06-22 01:22:00,151,I  could'nt be happier. Bring on Fall and Winter.
477967,canuckjack,2010-06-22 01:50:00,121, Blasphemer    You take that back!!
477972,BillM,2010-06-22 01:55:00,17367,"Dave, I think we saw run rise just after 5am and sunset at just past 10pm while up at the camp a week ago.  Pretty cool to have that much daylight...  More time for fishing!"
478033,Slop,2010-06-22 03:20:00,151,Dave I've seen the same thing when I've fished the Attawapiskat in the past. I'll be up that way in a few weeks to be tortured with long days. So much night fishing is ahead in the fall and winter months. Could'nt be happier.

478077,Tarzan's Jane,2010-06-22 10:27:00,1183,  why thank you  I wouldn't mind experiencing that much daylight - but I would be outta there with that much darkness.
478090,Bill Shearer,2010-06-22 12:04:00,456,I'm with you Dave! C'mon September
