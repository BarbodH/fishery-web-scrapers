So if anyone is interested in something like this for their basements, it works GREAT and not too much of a effort to install  http://store.waterpumpsupply.com/watersumppump.html  Bob"

It will not work if you are on a well and have no power. it will work if you are on a Municipal water sytem and have no power. A nieghbour of mine (I'm not friendly with)had one of those systems. Last winter for about 3 months there was a ton of water (ice) flowing out of the side of his house and down the street. His system malfunctioned and he recieved a $3500 water bill. No break for him, as the meter turned out to be correct. Looked good on him. I know when there is water running in my house and I would seek the source."

478005,a.cortellessa,2010-06-22 02:38:00,142,Just had renovations done and put a sump pump in for the first time. Only problems we've had was it kept backing up with water and flooding the back yard. Simple solution though.. goodluck with yours!  
478016,Rattletrap2,2010-06-22 02:56:00,1652,"I am on a well and as was mentioned, the water ""powered"" system would be of no use to me. I did however install a 12 volt back-up system to my sump. It works well and I keep my deep cycle batteries from my boat in the basement beside the pump system in case I need prolonged battery power during the Winter / early Spring season.  Like Joe said. any back-up plan is better than none!"
478078,Billy Bob,2010-06-22 10:50:00,5865," Joe, these newer water back up systems are a huge improvement over previous systems. This Liberty water driven system pumps out 2 gallons of water for every gallon used to drive the pump at 40 psi and the efficiency improves with more water pressure (we have over 50 psi here). Once installed I tested this unit and it PUMPS at a VERY GOOD rate lifting the water without a problem...almost as good as my electric sump pump.  I found the pump here at a local dealer for $125 and with another $65 for plumping parts I did the whole job for less than $200. I looked at the battery back up systems and they start at 3X that amount and UP plus you have to replace batteries every so often. It was a no brainer in my case.  Why didn't I replace the 29 year old pump....GOOD QUESTION...I researched my present Wayne pump and it's no longer produced in it's present form....you see, mine is a BRASS pump and now you can only get plastic or cast iron. So I thought about replacing it along with installing the water driven back up system but just decided to do the back up system for now. This way I am covered if I'm away and the power goes out which in most storms it does. I have a generator but that doesn't help if I'm out of town. So for now I'm protected and sometime in the future I will replace Old Faithful with a cast iron pump.  Bob"
