476993,Raf,2010-06-18 13:42:00,3495,all this talk about props & rpms has me curious about my rig.  i know what the WOT rpms should be but my ear isn't that trained.  what is involved in installing a tach on my 30 4-stroke merc tiller (2001)?  is this something better left to a professional?  i am somewhat mechanically inclined -- at least when it comes to automobile engines.
476995,Terry,2010-06-18 13:45:00,14456,these guys make a simple one that is easy to install  http://www.tinytach.com/tinytach/index.php
477000,Harrison,2010-06-18 14:00:00,2202,"I have one you can have Raf, let me know.  Got mine replaced when I had the Nitro, but found out later the tach is good.  Let me know."
477002,Raf,2010-06-18 14:05:00,3495,"I'll take it Phil  The one Terry suggested works by wrapping around a plug wire.. which would work fine but not as clean as I'd like.  From reading on the net, the 'factory' ones connect into the charging circuit and my motor may already have a connector for it."
477003,raysfish2005,2010-06-18 14:12:00,163,Hey raf keep an eye on your fuel consumption....im thinking of going to a 30 fourstroke....now a 5gallon lasts me the weekend with all the travel and trolling.....i see basspro has 25 fourstrokes for $4000.00 How long does your 5 gallong last as we do about the same travel when fishing but i dont carries Jp's wieght...lol  
477005,Raf,2010-06-18 14:21:00,3495,"I sent you a PM Ray.  The 30 sips fuel, mine's EFI which makes a bit of a difference compared to carb as well."
477027,Harrison,2010-06-18 15:32:00,2202,"Ok, it's yours.  It's in Nigeria right now, so send me a money transfer for shipping and we're good to go!  Ok ok, it's really in Pickering, but can bring it next week to downtown TO, let me know.  Actually, how would I explain a tach in my pocket at the G 20 security gates."
477038,irishfield,2010-06-18 16:21:00,26272,"Tell them you wanted to be ""up to speed"" on their security measures Phil !!"
477040,blue pickeral,2010-06-18 16:22:00,267,I have a 2001 Merc 4 stroke 40 hp. Was pretty easy to hook up following directions with the unit. Unfortunately don't have access to part number etc. but will look up this weekend if still interested.
477043,Raf,2010-06-18 16:27:00,3495,"Thanks Blue Pickeral, the 30 & 40 are essentially the same motor for those years.  I'd appreciate it!"
477128,Harrison,2010-06-18 20:34:00,2202,The way things are looking down here Wayne not sure I should  carry a pen in the security zone.
477793,blue pickeral,2010-06-21 17:55:00,267," Was not able to get away this past weekend, however, did some internet digging which might help you find a tach. The tach I used was the Quicksilver International II series - part number 79-825348A1. You can get a look at one here: (sorry for the long url)  http://www.marinepowerservice.com/BoatingStore/browse_parts3_kel.cf m/the_start/17/sort_mfg/0/sort_price_from/0/sort_price_to/0/sort_pr oducts/0/parent_cat/443085/parent_cat1/454915/parent_cat2/451425/pa rent_cat3/454052/parent_cat4/454221/layout/detail/display/16.cfm  (search www.marinepowerservice.com if url doesn't work)  Unfortunately, an application chart is not on this site, but a Mercury dealer could help you out with the right model. There were four wires on it - +12 volt for power, a ground, +12 volt for gauge backlighting, and the wire that ran to where it picked up signals from the outboard. I can't remember where it hooked up, but it was a simple spice/connection to an existing connector.  The directions that come with the tach also have a list of engine types and which 'settings' are used....you use a small screwdriver to choose the correct pulse.  Hope this will be of help. I have a side console model with throttle/gear box, but should be similar to the wiring harness/outputs of a tiller."
