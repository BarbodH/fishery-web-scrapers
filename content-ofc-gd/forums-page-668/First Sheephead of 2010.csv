477484,Duckie,2010-06-20 16:31:00,305,"yeah, they are ugly, but they fight pretty hard."
477486,BillsTheBassMan,2010-06-20 16:42:00,932,Sounds like he was a hungry bugger.  Was the battle a good one?
477489,Marko,2010-06-20 16:51:00,854,Nice fish! What other fish can be had there in the summer? I fish that harbor in the fall quite often but other then salmon and an odd trout here and there i have not seen anything else caught.
477514,Duckie,2010-06-20 18:43:00,305,"well, I have caught pretty much everything in the lake off this pier at one time or another:  carp pike trout (brown and rainbows, although the rainbow was never landed. long distance release lol) smallmouth sheephead white bass salmon in the fall  sometimes the action is slow, other times it can be good. My father, my uncle and I caught 2 browns and 2 sheephead one time in the span of 15 minutes - had to go due to rain, but boy, did it turn them ON!  you just never know."
