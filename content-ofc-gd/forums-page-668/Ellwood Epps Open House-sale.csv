477242,oxcowboy,2010-06-19 03:40:00,544,It is a shame that people have to think so much into a simple heads up post. I love going to epps each year.  we have been known to catch a few z's in the parking lot just waiting for them to open. We never buy much but its been part of our yearly trip since I started going many years ago.  Wish I could attend the sale. Jason
477246,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2010-06-19 04:01:00,0,"LOL!  Why are people so grumpy lately?  Maybe OFC needs to get out fishing a little more, and spend a little less time at the keyboard."
477256,archie_james_c,2010-06-19 06:09:00,618," I wouldnbt say anythinhg because im not a dipstick with no life...i'd say ""thank you for the heads up"" and move along if I wasn't interested. You need to join Bill The Bass Fisherman in the game of ""getting a life""...i'D HATE TO SEE THE GOSSEP YOU GUYS SPREAD ABOUT YOUR FRIENDS AND FAMILY."
477261,pikehunter,2010-06-19 08:09:00,1659,"Give it a break guys. Christ if a guy can't pass on info like this then OFC is really getting petty. This is exactly the reason I don't pass on the deals I see every once in a while when there is a clearout at work. I have seen some impressive deals that some members would appreciate but I just zip it up and say nothing because of the narrow minded thinking around here by a few members.  Thank you for the news on Epps, even though it will not do me any good as I have to work and will be nowhere close to the area.  Here's something that will make somebody drool. We let a brand new 9x7 slightly dented garage door go yesterday for a hundred bucks! I mention that only so I can see you squirm!"

477268,wormdunker,2010-06-19 10:05:00,1711,Thanx for the info at Elwood Epps.  When I was a youngster my father always stopped to browse while on our way further north.  Unfortunately I won't be in the area.  Bills you r losing 8 - 1!!
477273,Fisherman,2010-06-19 10:53:00,7201,"Well it's understandable that Bill the Bass Man is upset, you have to take into account that bass anglers have a shorter fishing season(not open yet) and therefore a higher level of frustration, often trying to relieve themselves by taking stabs at others when they should be giving themselves the rapid handshake. If you read the OP thread, it sure looks like an add and if you were a bit trigger happy then BtBM fires off a    whereas in good taste, should have just hit the ""wake up a mod"" button, and had them look at it."
477339,BillsTheBassMan,2010-06-19 15:27:00,932,"Hmmmm, I wonder what's worse.  1 guy saying don't advertise in the area where we're not supposed to advertise or 9 guys taking their ""moral"" high road and trying to flame him for it.  I guess we should just tell all the tackle shops to advertise in general discussion, so we'll have to wade through 100 ads whenever we're looking to talk about actual fishing.  I love how you respond to threads like this more than threads about actual fishing.  It kind of shows where your heads are at I guess."
477342,kickingfrog,2010-06-19 15:35:00,8333,I know what is worse.  It is easy to jump to conclusions sometimes.
477350,lew,2010-06-19 16:12:00,12766," If the OWNER of a tackle shop used this page to advertise his products it would be considered SPAM and is against the rules of the forum, but when a member informs us that Joe Schmucks Tackle Store is having a sale, or whatever, that's a whole nuther thing and is just an FYI for the rest of us and is perfectly with-in the rules.  It's something that we've done around here for many years and is normally helpful to the members who are looking to save a few $$$$.  One of the problems we have around here is too many folks deciding on their own what's right and what's wrong with a post and then taking it on themselves to tell others what to do.  If someone thinks there's a problem with a post, inform the moderators thru the appropriate channels and let them deal with it the way they want."
477355,vance,2010-06-19 16:32:00,719,  YES this the right way do do things and now that we know lets let this post go as a learning experience.  vance
477376,BillsTheBassMan,2010-06-19 18:08:00,932," Point Taken.  I was a little harsh with the initial response.  There's definitely a difference between a customer and a tackle shop owner announcing these things, I just thought there was already a forum for such announcements."
477381,lew,2010-06-19 18:33:00,12766, Not a problem at all Bill.....Group hug for everybody !!
477383,Mattones,2010-06-19 18:45:00,587,Thanks for the scoop  I was up that way yesterday! daMNN!
477388,discophish,2010-06-19 20:04:00,392," Umm, I don't think you understood what I wrote.  But I will forgive you because I'm a nice guy and finished 18 holes of golf today without getting rained on!  And i am here for all the right reasons, don't you worry about that."
477407,spooner_jr,2010-06-19 22:33:00,193, and number one was?
477409,BillsTheBassMan,2010-06-19 22:36:00,932, If you hadn't ever beat a dead horse before today you just did now.
477482,bassman87,2010-06-20 16:05:00,586,when is shoppers have a sale on maxi pads? some of us sure need some
477485,BillsTheBassMan,2010-06-20 16:38:00,932,I'd imagine it's around the same time the local middle school is offering basic English courses.
477509,BillM,2010-06-20 18:26:00,17367,This forum is going downhill fast.  Now a guy can't even post up a sales event at a local tackleshop to hopefully save a few people here some $$$?  The rubes should just shut up and say thank you or say nothing at all.
477530,bassman87,2010-06-20 19:24:00,586, you gonna tell them they cant do that too?
477695,Guest Johnny Bass,2010-06-21 13:19:00,0,"Thanks for the heads up. They must be doing something right. They bought out Pete's place down the street too.  Bill made a mistake, he was called for it, he apologized, and that should be the end of that.  I think its the moderators that should determine what is spam and what is not."
477059,ColdH20guy,2010-06-18 17:51:00,312,Hi guys Open House and fishing sale on Saturday for those that might be near Orillia..few reps on hand..barbque..fishing stories....
477063,BillsTheBassMan,2010-06-18 18:01:00,932,"You must have decided to wait for all the Admins to go to Lakair before posting this.  This would make me LESS likely to come to your event, as it is kind of ignorant advertising in a non-advertising forum."
477064,ColdH20guy,2010-06-18 18:06:00,312,glad your not my fishing partner..no harm was meant it was just a general statement..sheesh go back to bed....oh and glad you wont be there with an attitude like that
477066,ColdH20guy,2010-06-18 18:12:00,312,"i wasnt even mentioning any specific brand names ( unlike the dropshotting thread)..it was just a statement...man, I was in a good mood too... and I dont even work there..."
477067,FLEX ROD,2010-06-18 18:19:00,394,"Very well stated BillsTheBassMan!!  ColdH20guy, Bill just stated the facts.  FLEX"
477068,ColdH20guy,2010-06-18 18:20:00,312,somebody please delete the thread then..omg
477079,Terry,2010-06-18 18:54:00,14456,Hey you don't work there and you were giving the heads up of a sale and a chance to talk to some reps.....I see nothing wrong with that at all thanks  if you worked there then you would put it in the announcements spot. but you don't....
477080,Raf,2010-06-18 18:55:00,3495,the mods are gone?? wooohoo!!
477092,Chugger,2010-06-18 19:18:00,109,"Why is it a problem to tell someone about a sale?  Give it a rest dude.   I'm in the area that day and had no idea it was going on, I found the post helpful ColdH2O.  Some people on this board have nothing better to do than whine."
477107,glen,2010-06-18 19:51:00,2641,ColdH2Oguy.  Thanks for the heads up.
477109,davew3,2010-06-18 19:55:00,430,Holy jeez.  Does someone not like Elwood ?   If I was in the area I would stop in.  Great people there.
477116,lew,2010-06-18 20:02:00,12766,"It's pretty darned sad when a member takes the time to tell us about a sale on fishing gear and somebody jumps on him for doing it.  I wonder where this board is going sometimes.  Goodonya for passing on the info ColdH20guy, I'm not in the area to take advantage of the sale, but I'm sure others will appreciate your efforts."
477122,discophish,2010-06-18 20:17:00,392,"Yes, that's a little weird.  If I were to mention ""Come on down to the 'Taste Of Italy' fest this weekend for some great food, I hope that I wouldn't be stirring the pot ... unless you are a New Zealander!  hehe.  BTW, come on down ... but of course, after you go and check out the fishing sale"
477129,fish_fishburn,2010-06-18 20:34:00,1311,Thanks for the info Coldh20. Hey Bills whats up buddy? You fall out of bed this morning.
477133,fishindude,2010-06-18 20:51:00,220,"If anything, this is a good heads up for those who havn't left from the GTA yet as Orillia is on the way to Lakair!"
477136,otter649,2010-06-18 20:56:00,118,People post about sales at Lebaron/Basspro & Canadian Tire etc from time to time so how is this any different.......
477137,NAW,2010-06-18 20:58:00,4022,Thanks for the info man.  As for Bills reply..  What up your  man.  There's no need for that kind of talk.
477139,ColdH20guy,2010-06-18 21:07:00,312,thanks for your support guys..thats all I was trying to do..pass the message along of a fishing store with a sale/open house that they have every year a week before bass opens... appreciate it....
477140,bigugli,2010-06-18 21:15:00,6138,"Mr.Epps place was the Muskoka Mecca when I grew up. It was a big deal to get to go with the men to the ""shop"" to pick up tackle and check out the new stuff on the shelves. The stories that would be told there  Last time there he must have been in his 90's and still coming out to chat at the store. Glad to hear the store is still open for business."
477141,ColdH20guy,2010-06-18 21:25:00,312,they have actually 'split' the store into 2..the main store is the hunting/camping/general outdoors/firearms store and the fishing store is about half mile south from the main store...
477152,HTHM,2010-06-18 21:57:00,4082,
477163,Fisherman,2010-06-18 22:22:00,7201, I didn't think you were supposed to stir Lasagna or Pizza
477197,Tdel,2010-06-19 00:53:00,393," Lew, seems to be more and more people posting replies like this on this board.  What is wrong with these people anyway?  ColdH2Oguy, thanks for the heads up on the sale.  I live in the general area and just might have to drop in and see what they have available. I might even buy something or two.  Tom."
477202,ctdd2006,2010-06-19 01:13:00,531,I too am finding the mood on this board a little tiresome lately!  Too bad...I love coming here!
477204,archie_james_c,2010-06-19 01:26:00,618,"Bill the Bass Fisherman...get a life. Epps is one of the best sporting goods stores around. If the guy cant even come on here and say ""Hey guys we're having a sale this week and BBQ, come on out"" than thats just danmed sad. Get a life Bill...go fishing or something."
