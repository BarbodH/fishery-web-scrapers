Humans are filthy so try not to go off on a rant like I usually do because it won't help a thing. Get involved, teach your kids and others and hope it catches on some day."
57969,bigbuck,2007-04-10 16:46:00,2449,"I know this is an older thread but I'm killing a bit of time here at the office and came across this. Lew, it's disgusting what people do. Load your garbage and take it to the nearest transfer station, for 5-10 bucks at least it gets disposed of semi-properly instead of being dumped in a creek. For a left winger, Miller doesn't seem too interested in the environment (considering he was first elected for his opposition to the island airport which is still there). In the east end of Scarborough, there's a new subdivision going in on formerly city-owned greenspace (bush). Miller was asked about it and said it's no big deal, it's only scrub brush in there (lots of trees, not just scrub brush). I don't want to start a political firestorm on this site but come on, I guess Mayor Miller is succombing to big business like everyone else for the graft that they supply to politicians. Either that or he doesn't care."
57994,valerie,2007-04-10 17:34:00,83,Living in toronto i can see alot more people dumping their garbage if they have to pay $2 a bag after the second bag. Soon we are going to pay to walk and breath when we leave our homes.
58001,Handlebarz,2007-04-10 17:54:00,3790,Lew I here ya its very sad that our places are turing into dumps. We get alot of it here and I have no answer on how to stop it education seems to not work but then again jail time might not work either maybe humilitaion (or how ever ya spell it will work) try taking people if caught and put there picture on signs along the road ways with warnings of LITTER BUG under there face or make them pick up the areas and play the video on a 60 min special right after the super bowl or daytona 500. I guess its still up to the 10% to clean up after the slobs.  This past winter the OPP did a blitz here for booze and people leaving junk on LSC I was happy to here they were out at 7am checking people and then again at the end of the day but was sshocked to here all the people crying on a local board that they were harrassing them on the lake so I guess were damnd if we do or dont.
56894,Whopper,2007-04-08 14:30:00,2174,"I know we have kicked this topic around a few times and yes Lew it a shame. We have the same problem here.  Let's look at the bigger picture, If a person can take another human being's life and not be held accountable how in the world are we going to eliminate victimless crime like littering. Not saying that the two crimes are the same but I think it starts at the top and filters all the way down.  All we can do is try to educate the people around us and play nursemaid to those who don't care.  My office is on the same street as a county collection center and a land fill and people will dump stuff along the road right out in front of both places just so they don't have to pay. The county then will bring the jail birds out about once every six weeks to clean up the mess. Now I personally think that using the jail birds is great and they should probably have them out and about everyday, but no we wouldn't be able to do any thing like that it would violate ""their rights"" as prisoners.  Whopper"
56904,Deano,2007-04-08 15:14:00,767,"A big problem is too much of our tax money is in administration and less and less is in action. We pay more taxes, have a bigger population, and yet we get so much less services than ever. Also goverment is wasting so much money on Global Warming, something that man has about maybe 5% impact on. Wasting money when that money could be used for a real polution problem. There's no reason to charge people to dispose of garbage, and most garbage can be recycled and even a profit made on it.  My biggest beef is with broken beer bottles, these are refundable, yet they can be found all around shorelines and at most crown land campsites. These pose a danger to our kids, pets as well as us. So many beautiful places I've been to, couldn't spend any time to enjoy, because I didn't want my dogs or kids to hurt themselves.  I've even thought of talking to the city and see if they would pay me to go out and clean up all the trash with truck and trailer, and not charge me to put it in the dump. As for just picking up other garbage, it would cost you money to bring others junk to the dump.  Many people don't have any respect for themselves, so they sure aren't gonna have respect for nature."
56908,mattyk,2007-04-08 15:22:00,2110,Some people just have no respect for anything these days especially mother nature.  It makes me so MAD! When will people learn that we can't treat the environment like a garbage can.
56910,Clampet,2007-04-08 15:25:00,1947," 10 Percent of the population are great human beings. 90 percent are useless trash. Sad, but a reality.  It doesn't matter where you go. I work in an office environment, where people where suits, white shirts, and ties. Very professional ambience/atmosphere,however;when you visit the washroom, you get to see how wearing dress clothes does not guarantee quality people, as some leave the facility in a disgusting mess."
56922,fliptheslop,2007-04-08 15:47:00,112,"Saw the same thing at Port Hope yesterday more garbage flowing down the river than you cam imagine and than some morons thought it would be a good idea to fill balloons with water and throw them in the river must have been more than 100 float past me, top it off with some great outdoor folk feeding the swan and ducks there, once they have every shithawk for miles around running into our fishing lines, they leave, but low and behold they dont take their garbage with them just throw the empty bags from the bread and their coffee cups beside the car and drive away"
56932,tjsa,2007-04-08 16:06:00,1578,"Same thing up here, but in remote locations where people do not have walking trails and such, just bush roads. We often find trash dumped, shingles and refrigerators are the big ones, but couches and chairs, truck bed liners even, etc. etc. The bad thing about the refrigerators, or freezers is, if the perp is not caught, the MNR has to remove them, at cost. They are mandated to have them removed, or pay someone to have it done, to recover the gas in them, so, ultimately, we all pay for it as taxpayers, and the MNR budget gets smaller, and smaller, for enforcement, or other duties."

56990,ch312,2007-04-08 17:58:00,1590,"the major problem would be that you have to pay tipping fees at the landfill to get rid of junk. $5 minimum and then $60/ton around here. $5 per tire as well. i know it isnt alot of money but people having to pay to dump their garbage definatly makes alot of people throw their garbage in ditches. im not trying to defend people that throw their garbage anywhere, i just think it would make a huge difference if it wasnt so pricey to dump garbage at the landfill.  ive taken a few loads to the dump from my house renovations and im up to about $170 just in tipping fees so i can understand why some people throw their garbage anywhere."
57005,ryanheritage,2007-04-08 18:30:00,180,"How about we (OFC COMMUNITY) put together ""A CLEANUP DAY"" with some schools? Like a day in june? It can be a volunteer thing for an extra mark. This is something I have been thinking of doing since I saw The ""float you fanny down the ganny"" devistaion. We could maybe get some sponsors? City approval and help? maybe some media attention? I dunno but it is soo sad to see what people are doing to the rivers and creeks.."
