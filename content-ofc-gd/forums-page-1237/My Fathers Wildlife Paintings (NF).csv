57934,taper,2007-04-10 16:05:00,611,That is a very nice collection of pieces.
57952,Terry,2007-04-10 16:27:00,14456,"they are great painting, it would be real cool if you could finish the unfinished ones yourself"
57959,wayne gatt,2007-04-10 16:33:00,7,They are very nice indeed. Best of luck to you in either completing what you feel should be done or having someone else doing it for you.
57963,outdoorguy61,2007-04-10 16:39:00,220,Perhaps someone like the lady that posts here (Pam Dallaire?) could advise. Just a thought as the work looks very nice.  outdoorguy61

58267,Rattletrap2,2007-04-11 01:44:00,1652,WOW!!! Nice work indeed! You should be very proud of those pieces.
58311,RobHall,2007-04-11 02:47:00,261,Thanks for all the nice compliments.  It means alot.  I can just see my father smiling now.  I'm proud of my father in so many ways.  It just too bad he didn't get the chance to finish what he started and i'm sure he would have painted so much more.  I am going to finish his unfinished artwork...no matter how long it takes me.  Check out the unfinished artwork here.   FOTB
