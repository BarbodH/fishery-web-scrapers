58442,Golfisher,2007-04-11 13:27:00,586,"I was flipping through this month's In-Fisherman magazine and came across this little interesting bit of info:  ""The Texas Parks and Wildlife Department maintains lists of 50 largest largemouth, smallmouth, and striped bass caught in public waters.  Researchers at Texas Tech University used these catch records to estimate the likelihood that fish qualifying for these lists would be caught in any given year.  Based on the number of days fished for each species, the odds for an angler to catch a fish big enough for the top-50 lists on a single day are less than 1 in 120 million angling days for largemouth, 1 in 38 million days for smallmouth, and 1 in 30 million days for striped bass.""  Well, I think I've spent about 40 days fishing for largies so far, so that's 40 days down, 119,999,960 more days to go.  Pretty good odds, eh?"
