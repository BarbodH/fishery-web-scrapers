Especially because the credit is almost in my backyard now!  Headed out sunday night just before dark - it was tough because my eyelets were icing up, but it was nice to get out on the water... I love new the felt bottom waders...  I was stickin' to the rocks like spiderman!  Thanks again for all the tips from everybody on the board....  Now down to the fishing.  I only stayed out for an hour or so, but I did manage my first fish of 2007 - a 2lb sucker! haha It's better than nothing - and at least I can say I caught a fish on my new steelhead combo!  Here's the fish of the day!   Cheers - and good fishin' UF"
