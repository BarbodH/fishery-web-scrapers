58029,Bob,2007-04-10 18:43:00,370,"Yeah, I remember the plastic ""colourizers"" for the tv screen.  Speaking of backfires, Dad's old Hudson had a habit of not starting in the mornings and he hated to use the crank because it sometimes backfired and would snap the crank backwards.  The solution was to roll it down the driveway and get a bunch of us neighbourhood kids to push it to the hill at the corner so he could roll start it.  Chuck, chuck k'Pow! and away he'd go. Yeah, transistor radios except mine was usually on CFGM, not CHUM.  I was country when it wasn't cool yet.  I wasn't too stuck on that new Elvis guy but I didn't mind Bill Hailey.  Mostly I listened to Don Gibson, Marty Robbins, Eddy Arnold etc. OX..ford 9724. Did my driving test in a '58 Pontiac wagon, that was really uncool and I remember the swing-arm turn signals on the Austin, my buddy had one. My first car was a '50 Pontiac that had the business end of a 9 iron for a gear shift handle, L-head in-line 6 cylinder that would make todays sixes look like they came out of a Singer but lots of room under the hood to work on them. I think the best car I ever owned was a '57 Pontiac, prettier than the Chevies in my opinion. I get the notion you and I are pretty close to same age Lew.  I have just a couple of years to Old Age Pension."
58043,JFR,2007-04-10 19:04:00,498,"Thanks Moe, and everyone for stirring the memories.  I wonder what the current generation will have as memories."
58078,TAH,2007-04-10 20:36:00,133,"memories for sure, all food was made from scratch nothing boxed or prepacked, the old glass scrubbing board, the Outhouse  to add a few more"
58086,Bob,2007-04-10 20:49:00,370,"I think when we got our first tv, there were 4 available channels, one each in Toronto and Hamilton and two in Buffalo and I remember climbing on the roof to turn the antenna until you got the best reception.  It was a three person operation, one to watch the set and yell instructions to the one at the door who relayed them to the guy on the roof. I remember rope swings over the swimming hole in the east branch of the Don River.  Check the colour of the river before you grab the rope though, there was a paint plant up the river and sometimes the water had some strange colour to it.  Polio was a big issue then but not to us, we were indestructable.  We were forbidden to swim in the river but that didn't make much difference either. I lived near Warden and Danforth and used to tie my fishing rod on the crossbar of my bike and ride out to Pickering to fish Duffins Creek.  Used to be some nice pan sized trout in there, I guess it has a salmon run today. Flat top haircuts!  Used to call it a boogie cut, brush on top and long and combed back at the sides.  I had one like that when I started high school."
58093,Heybud_e,2007-04-10 20:56:00,208,or how about..  when you old timers used to walk 4 miles to get to school in the snow with no boots??? LoL

58169,Bob,2007-04-10 23:40:00,370,"8 trck cassettes, yeah they were from more modern times.  I had a '65 Fairlane that had a 4 track cassette machine in it.  Sound was great but after the 8 track units came out, I couldn't find tapes for it.  My '69 Mustang had an 8 track. Sound wasn't as good. I also remember in-dash record players that played the 45 rpm records.  They were a big hit with the girls around 1960 or so. You only played them when you were parked.  Roads were too bumpy and the record would skip all over the place. 2 mile walk to school, always had boots and the road was up and down but always seemed more downhill on the way home. PF Flyers were running shoes, also Keds. Brush cut was a butch haircut and butch wax was to make it stand up straight. Green stamps were a premium thing at some stores, you got them according to how much you spent and stuck them in a book and after you got a zillion of them, you could trade them for merchandise.  All computerised now, you get bonus points on your card at Zeller's, Shopper's Drug Mart etc.  Same idea and you still need a zillion of them to be worth anything."
58181,tjsa,2007-04-10 23:57:00,1578,"OOOHHHHH YEEAAHHH, now I remember PF Flyers, and Keds of course, with the big white leather circle on the outside ankle bone. I wore those for years fishing speck creeks, wading wet in pants or shorts.  Come to think of it, those were probably the original ""wading shoes"""
58224,ryanheritage,2007-04-11 00:50:00,180,LMBO!!!! I was wondering about the Black jack gum thing so I checked it out and I am wrong.... The black jack gum you guys are talking about and the stuff I thought it was are two different brands....So yeah my young years made my mouth write a check my butt couldn't cash...  
58240,camillj,2007-04-11 01:11:00,1988,Wow ... I think I got 100% +++ .... scarey .. and some memories that just didnt need to be re-awakened  ....  anyhow ... some that really 'sprang back' .... and caused a smile included ...   The button on the floor boards of our '70 Valiant .. which .. yes .... controlled the high beams  The glass coke bottles .... and the paper straws which never seemed to make it till the end of the bottle  My 45 collection which got stolen in first year University (after a party I supplied the music for)... and has never been replaced .... cassettes had already made it unnecessary to have 45's ith just your favourite songs on them for parties  Tinfoil balls - the special additions to the rabbit ears specially designed to last at least three periods on a wednesday (or Saturday) night  Jawbreakers - not mentioned but in the same league as the paper straws and rockets...  The milk-box ... which in our first apartment was where the milkman would pick up our empties and leave the milk .... it actually opened right from the inside of the apartment out to the outside (two separate doors) ... dont think our front door locked in those days .. or else the milkman used to 'buzz' the super to get in .... who would have to come out to let him in anyways ...  rollerskates that actually needed a key... to fasten them to your runners  Superslider snow skates .... for those of us who couldnt afford fancy wooden skis  Close and play - fancy new technology to play your records (practically idiot proof)  pinpall ... that actually had pins (nails and springs) and no wires or lights  Corvettes .... the first cars that had aything other than real metal in their bodies ...  Car tires that actually had tubes (and needed them)  Coke floats  Drive ins which only worked if you hung the speaker inside the drivers side window  When you knew everyone ever invited to Scuttlebut lodge  When you knew everyone in the NHL (all six teams)  Girls only played hockey in a field with a funny looking curved stick  Goalies didnt wear masks  And nobody wore helmets  Hamburger Fries and a coke .. and change back from a buck was the slogan for the worlds newest franchise ... which quickly had a sign that said 'over a million served'
58255,danc,2007-04-11 01:32:00,4677,"I remember Black Cat gum, but not Black Jack. I also remember when doctors made house calls."
58259,Bob,2007-04-11 01:37:00,370,I'm sure some will remember the old cars that had the little shiny chrome push button on the dash that activated the starter but do you remember the early 50s Buicks that had the starter button under the gas pedal?  You had to turn on the key and push the gas pedal right to the floor to engage the starter.  These dumb things just keep coming to me ever since this thread started.
58265,camillj,2007-04-11 01:42:00,1988,My '69 Camaro had no 'button' or latch to pop the trunk .. but you could take the keys out with the car still running to get at the trunk .... and if you locked the keys in the trunk you were fine as long as you didnt turn the ignition all the way to 'lock' ... just drive home for the other set

I made it all the way down before doing a huge face plant ... the next day I got skis and skiing lessons .... imagine that
58336,ryanheritage,2007-04-11 03:42:00,180,I don't know if anyone remembers the mechano sets? but thats pretty much what I sell for a living but on a much larger scale.... It's funny cause when I tell my customers thats what its like to put up one of my buildings I hear all about the things you guys keep talking about. I also always hear about the days when you could go for a burger and it was served to your car window by some little hottie on roller skates.. Does anyone have a picture of a mechano set? I don't even know what one looks like I just know its a lot of nuts and bolts. lol.
58350,Nemo,2007-04-11 05:20:00,727,"Meccano set  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meccano    Also what about the old white plastic milk jugs with the red handle and carboard top. Must have weighed 20 pounds each. I remember those being delivered through the milk door at the side of the house.  Also what about the Liquor Store. Go in with my Dad fills out the paper with a little pencil. Goes to the wicket and the guys goes back and gets a bottle of Rum in a brown paper bag???  Guys throwing real pizza pies in the air.  The guy at the rink who sharpened your skates with all the sparks.  Smoking in the office, airplanes, bars....... Smoke $2.85 a pack and good for you, gas 35c a litre, .. House in Toronto $35k.  Brown box with all the buttons to change channels connected to the TV with a long cable. TV from Buffalo Commander Tom   and Irv Weinstein    The Brewers Retail (not the Beer Store) where a square would set you back $14.00 at the most.  Yellow garbage trucks in T.O. with three guys. The driver, two guys on the back. A cool case of Red Cap Ale in the cab for those hot days. They'd pick up anything.    Getting Ex Tickets with your report card.  Candies - Sherbert Fountains, wax lips and teeth, Ton of Gum, foil packaged hostess chips 10 cents a bag. Hockey Cards 10 cents with that crap strip of pink gum (O pee Chee).

TV - Charlies Angel,  Bionic Man, Wild Kingdom, Tiny Talent Time CHCH in Hamilton, Disney on Sunday Night with a TV Dinner.     I could go on and on.....LOL  Great thread."
57820,Bob,2007-04-10 11:07:00,370,"I remember.  Not only milk delivery but ice for the icebox too.  Deliveries made with horse-drawn wagons and this was Scarborough.  Believe the dairy was Acme Farmers.  The corner store had a pop cooler with racks that the bottles hung from and you had to slide the bottle to the end of the rack to get it out. Bottle of pop was 7 cents and you got 2 back for the bottle.  Bought my first bike delivering the Globe & Mail, dollar down and a dollar a week.  Cigarettes at 33 cents for a small pack and 41 for large and if Mom sent me to the store to buy some for her, no questions were asked.  I remember the first tv set we had, 21"" Admiral that had doors that closed over the screen.  I think that was about '54 and one of the first in the neighbourhood.  All the local kids wanted to come over on Saturday mornings to watch cartoons and the serials (Remember those? The hero was certainly dead at the end of the show but when they replayed the final scenes the next week, he miraculously escaped.) Ah, my brother and I were likely the most popular kids in the 'hood then, all because of a tv. 78 rpm records before the 45s,  Dad's first car that I remember was a 1929 Hudson.  I remember Packards too and Henry Js.  Jeeps were made by Willys Motors.  I could probably keep adding to this forever."
57841,hawkeye,2007-04-10 12:20:00,162,"Ouch, now I really feel old. What about radio, the Lone Ranger, the Shadow, the Fat Man, Sky King. And what about the Ash men. These were the old version of trash collectors that actually came into your basement and hauled away the ashes from your coal furnace. Stuff musta weighed a ton. Beat cops that actually walked a beat, and enforced the law in their own special way, the list goes on............................."
57843,Eddyk,2007-04-10 12:23:00,195,I can remember the breadman coming to the front door every morning with his big tray of cakes and cookies and we would bugg our mother to but the good stuff. I can also remembering paying 30.9 a GALLON for gas.
57848,Alumacraft,2007-04-10 12:43:00,139,"Blackjack gum is still around I see it in a local store every day. I also remember laying in the back of the station wagon while traveling on the family vacations. Also remember the oil truck coming too fill up the oil tank for the winter.And how about the guy that would drive around the neighborhood real slow ringing his bell offering his services too sharpen scirrors ,knives,or whatever.(maybe that one was just a local thing).Damn I'm getting old."

57870,valerie,2007-04-10 14:04:00,83,How about those silver bullet gums that made your lips and teeth silver or when it costed $2.50 for a pack of smokes or those huge glass coke bottles. I even had my grade 5 teacher make me go buy ciggarets for her wow that goes back 20 years.
57876,Bob,2007-04-10 14:15:00,370,"Grinding wheel on a stand with a pair of wheels on the bottom and a foot pedal to drive the grinding wheel.  I remember teachers calling students to class with the same kind of bell.  How about the sheeney or rag & bone man who used to tour the neighbourhoods with a horse and wagon picking up anything that could possibly be recycled?  I remember the coal man coming to deliver sacks of coal which he opened and dumped down the chute to fill the coal bin.  Carrying ashes out to spread on the ice in the driveway to give some traction for usually bald tires.  Tires got replaced when you couldn't patch them anymore.  Oh yeah, no such thing as a tubeless tire and you had to be so careful not to get a wrinkle in the tube when you put it back in after a repair."
57907,lew,2007-04-10 15:04:00,12767,"Yeah I remember all that stuff Bob and also remember the day the milk man was stopped in front of our house and a car went by and backfired and scared the daylights outta the horse. He took off down the street pulling the milk wagon and when he turned a corner the wagon rolled over and spilled everything all over the road  Our 1st TV around 1950 had about an 8"" screen and somebody came out with a way to make it a color set......it was a piece of colored plastic that you hung over the screen, but sure didn't work too well  Don't know how, but I still remember our phone # from back then.....RI....verdale 3331  I bought my 1st pack of smokes in 1960....Parlaiments for 39 ¢  Who had a transistor radio when you were a kid in the late 50's ?? Once you were able to afford  the best available, a radio with 10 transistors, you were the king of the neighborhood and  you'd reached the BIG TIMES. You were the one everybody hung around cause you got the best sound from CHUM  Canvas running shoes, ducktailed hair cuts, tucking your smokes into the sleeve of your T-shirts, hockey cards fastened to the spoke on your bike so it sounded like a motor cycle, thinking you'd won the lottery if you got a green ""American"" coke bottle from the vending maching........  Playing King of the Castle & cops and robbers & cowboys and indians. The cowboys always won because political correctness hadn't been invented yet.  Every kid in the neighborhood wore a gun on his hip and as far as I know, none of us grew up to be murderers  I took my drivers test in a 1955 Austin A-35 and for turn signals, you turned a manual switch on the dash board and lighted plastic arms would flip out from the side of the car. I pretty nearly failed my test cause the guy giving it to me had never seen those before  Great times back then !!!!!"
57914,Whopper,2007-04-10 15:27:00,2174,"LOL Lew  I'm not as old as Lew    but this story is told about once a year by my mother, I was about four years old and we had a milkman that delivered to our house everday and I hid in the back of his truck and went for a ride one day, I was probabaly missing for only about 15 minutes and I can still remember the smell from inside the truck.  Lew your ciggs must have been expensive because I bought my first pack out of a vending machine at the local bowling alley at fourteen and they were 28 cents. You inserted 30 cents and pulled the knob and there was two pennies taped to the pack and a patch of matches to boot.   Whopper"
