58187,tjsa,2007-04-11 00:06:00,1578,"I was reading all the responses, and may have missed someone mentioning it. The tire weight lead is good for jigs, and bottom bouncer molds, stuff you do not need to crimp with pliers. Not great for egg sinker, split shot, and such molds. It is a much harder lead alloy. You can crimp it, but it takes much effort. If you use it for split shot, it usually breaks at the joint."
58241,Heybud_e,2007-04-11 01:15:00,208,"awesome, you guys are great!  i also got a jigging mold, looks like stingray in a way,  pure lead is good, nice and clean.."
58247,Roy,2007-04-11 01:27:00,13728,"I get all of my powder paints from luremaking.com. They're in Ontario and provide super service. You can get lead almost anywhere. Not that many folks want the stuff laying around anymore. My garage  gives me all the wheel weights I want but recently, a friend who works for a utility company brings me a 30-40 pound box when he visits...I have way more than I can use."
58383,aplumma,2007-04-11 10:34:00,6896,If you are looking for good lead you can get cakes of it from plumbing supply houses we use it to join cast iron together in some now rare applications.  Art
57589,Heybud_e,2007-04-09 23:18:00,208,"i recently inherited some egg sinker molds as well as jigging molds, where is a good place to get some lead? i know of tire shops, any other ideas? help and suggestions are greatly appreciated....Bud"
57597,topraider,2007-04-09 23:46:00,30,"There are metal dealers around who buy scrap metal from the public and resell it to larger dealers/and or smelters. Look in the phone book yellow pages under ""scrap metal"" and make a few calls."

57618,easton13th,2007-04-10 00:13:00,371,My Dad work on the water dept...and they gave away the lead from the hydrants....not sure if they still do it BUT it was 10 - 15lbs pieces. Call the local water dept. worth a try?
57627,fliptheslop,2007-04-10 00:20:00,112,"you have to watch the lead you use as some has a lot of other elements in it and whenyou melt it, it not good lead, but if you cook enough of it you will get the good stuff, sorry its hard to explain but once you start melting it you will see what I mean"
57637,Heybud_e,2007-04-10 00:27:00,208,"yep, used to melt down quite a bit of lead, you can tell that there is impurities in it, ....  but thanks guys, i will open the phone book tomorrow after work.... i figure its something i can do to kill time..from time to time.. might even paint em"
57676,fliptheslop,2007-04-10 01:00:00,112,"sorry I didnt really answer your question, if you are looking to buy lead Bass Pro Shop sells it, or im sure you can go to any tire shop or Can. Tire and they should give you some old tire wieghts"
57739,Heybud_e,2007-04-10 02:02:00,208,"cool...  i will try the tire shops,  i should have enuff to make due for the summer, but not a bad idea to stock pile  any idea as to what good paints would go best, seeing as they are going to be submerged??"
57743,Bernie,2007-04-10 02:07:00,3190,Powder paint is all I  use. Takes a few tries to get it right but its the easiest and it outlasts paint. If you want lead tire shops will likely be glad to give you some. ....Bernie
57750,Heybud_e,2007-04-10 02:17:00,208,"can i get the powder paint at like walmart, or michaels or something like that??"
57760,Bernie,2007-04-10 02:46:00,3190,A small amount of powder paint will last a long time. Living in the north my supply is limited.The last time I bought some was 2 years ago at the fishing show. Perhaps some other folks on the board have seen it in their local fishing supply stores. Several different colours are available. Personally I like to start with a base coat of white or lumesent white and add the colour coat after.

57767,Bernie,2007-04-10 02:55:00,3190,Have about 4 or 5 glow colours (I will say glow because I cant spell lumescent  )
57773,Heybud_e,2007-04-10 03:15:00,208,"ahhh gotcha, id like to get my hands on some for a few spoons, got a bucket of spoons which the paint had peeled off and some i found snorkelling... may as well use em for something...."

57799,Northhunter,2007-04-10 06:12:00,214,"Nipissing - Ramakko's in Sudbury sells the paint you use if you're ever in the city. They might charge a little more than down south? but seemed to have a good selection last time I was there.  HeyBud - for paint I would check any tackle shops that sell lure making stuff (wire, spinner blades, etc.)."
57874,Bernie,2007-04-10 14:14:00,3190,Thanks for the info Northhunter. Probably in Toronto more often than Sudbury. My present supply should last a few more years anyway.
57897,sirfish,2007-04-10 14:49:00,175,"Best way to get it is to visit the scrap yards and go for a walkabout with a pair of pliers in tow. There are still many in the niagara area that let you walk around to look for your own parts. Millers is one, frontier is another and I'm sure there are more. I'ts not to hard to find a couple of pounds in a walk that fit nicely into the pocket."
58080,Heybud_e,2007-04-10 20:41:00,208,"thanks northhunter, im actually heading to Elliot Lake in July, im sure i can manage to hit Sudbury if i dont find any here...."

58176,Gerritt,2007-04-10 23:47:00,6129,All the lead you could ever want.....   http://www.marsmetal.com/newpages/specasthome.html  We have used  them for their Lead Sheets as a maluable flashing on high end custom homes that use quarried stone vs. brick..  I am sure they have a ton of scrap laying around you may be able to get your hands on. 99.94% pure lead?? will that do the trick?  Hope this helps!  Gerritt.
