58129,Rich Clemens,2007-04-10 22:17:00,3131,I think the cure for cabin fever is just around the corner ... if not already here.  Everyone's too dang busy getting ready for openers.  Mods won't have much to do if we keep this up.
58150,Golfisher,2007-04-10 23:15:00,586,"Well, we've hand plenty of diehard fans of a certain sports franchise, which shall remain unnamed, manifesting all the symptoms of an acute cabin fever.  Wait, that wasn't cabin fever; it's closer to a heart condition, like a broken heart."

57877,Tootsie II,2007-04-10 14:16:00,162,"For some of us who remember 99% of that "" Older Than Dirt"" thread, melting down just accelerates the inevitable. With the "" golden years"", yah, right, we come to realize that with all that we've survived, remembering the ones that we knew who didn't make it this far, life is far too short and you should carefully pick the issues that are worth blowing a gasket over."
57880,Bob,2007-04-10 14:23:00,370,"Nah, it's not that life is short, it's the longest thing you're going to do but dang, you're a long time dead after.  Enjoy while you can."

57942,Hookset,2007-04-10 16:15:00,367,"I think secretly T.J. and the moderators put in an ""Instigator Penalty"" rule just like the N.H.L. We are all now a ""kinder and gentler"" crowd highlighting our speed and skills. I draw the line at group hugs tho....  Hookset."
