I am going to try and spend more time on Simcoe to see if I can get into some of those monster smallies and of course some fall perch action did that once last year and it was a blast.  I would like to fish Sturgeon and Pigeon and perhaps Rice since they are close by.  I would love to try the BOQ for some monster eyes this fall.
