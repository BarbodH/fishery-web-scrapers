58157,lew,2007-04-10 23:31:00,12767,Looks like Mother Nature still wants to show us who's the boss around here.  Sposed to be getting around 4 inches of snow Wednesday night and into Thursday in the Toronto area and varying amounts everywhere else.  Doncha just luv springtime in Ontario ??
58162,Gerritt,2007-04-10 23:34:00,6129,I dont think Love is the word I would use Lew..  Loathe? perhaps...  Gerritt.
58165,huntervasili,2007-04-10 23:38:00,1604,Shoot.. I thought that was supposed to be a joke and you were kidding... Who knows maybe we'll be ice fishing come july...
58175,lew,2007-04-10 23:47:00,12767,"We were all pretty smug when winter didn't arrive till February this year, but it looks like were making up for it now  It was the coldest February in 27 years in this area, and so far it's been the coldest April in the last decade."
58180,Golfisher,2007-04-10 23:50:00,586,Back to hibernation.  Dang.
58186,douG,2007-04-11 00:04:00,2693,Watcha call yer climate change there.  Or maybe just unusual.
58191,Nanook,2007-04-11 00:08:00,565,"Hah !!! They are even calling it a WINTER storm, they dont even remember it's Spring LOL! What make's ya think they will be right THIS time............."
58196,tjsa,2007-04-11 00:13:00,1578,"DARN IT ALL!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Why do you guys down south get all the fun??  WE NEED IT, WE WANT IT,  lots of dry wells up here, along with parched forests, and no runoff expected for steelhead season.  Our forecast is a 30-40 percent chance of flurries on wednesday into thursday, and a 60 percent chance of rain on saturday.  I would prefer a 70-80 percent chance on both occasions."
58197,bucktail,2007-04-11 00:15:00,1857,Kill me now!!!!
58210,pikehunter,2007-04-11 00:32:00,1659,Crap! I just emptied the remainder of the snowblower's gas into the car! The snow should be quick to melt anyway.
58270,camillj,2007-04-11 01:47:00,1988,So much for global warming ....right now I'd settle for a little local warming
58272,Heybud_e,2007-04-11 01:51:00,208,"where is the storm? it flurried for a small bit here, but nothing major... it was actually nice out today..."
58296,GbayGiant,2007-04-11 02:23:00,1780,"Must be coming from up here, last two days it was snowing pretty good, but it's going to warm up.  Start of the season everyone was complaining that there was no ice, now the dang stuff won't go away fast enough."
58299,BryceBurzynski,2007-04-11 02:34:00,181,I will be the one shoveling at my house!
58319,urbanangler1990,2007-04-11 03:04:00,933," its coming, from the west, 2 low pressure systems may collide just below us"
58402,ccmtcanada,2007-04-11 11:34:00,7971,Phew!! North of the 401 from London to GTA should get the wet snow...maybe 10cm or more.  At least Toronto and areas surrounding should only get rain/wet snow mix with little or no accumulation.  That's what they are saying now...this may change 50 times between now and when it's supposed to get here later today...LOL
58409,Eddyk,2007-04-11 11:55:00,195,Just yesterday I noticed the ice was all gone from a lake behind me.
58415,hawkeye,2007-04-11 12:23:00,162,"what a rotten way to start the day, but as others have said same thing year in and year out"
58497,easton13th,2007-04-11 14:32:00,371,"If we ignore it maybe it won't happen. I to have put away the snowblower and the shovels for the season, I am planning on leaving them there. PLEASE. with fingers crossed."
58505,rickster,2007-04-11 14:48:00,495,forcasting +10 to +14 celcius for the weekend up here in sunset country anybody down there need to borrow a shovel you can have mine ..lol just kidding we'll probably get a dump yet it warms up for good
58522,Bitsmith2k,2007-04-11 15:04:00,396," clampet with your track record of influencing the weather, could you please, for the love of god, not predict snow next year?"
58526,Puckhead,2007-04-11 15:07:00,377,no... nooooo...nooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
58533,lew,2007-04-11 15:12:00,12767,"I remember driving to the musky Odyssee 4 years ago this weekend and it was one of the worst freezing rain days I've ever seen. Took about twice as long to get to St. Catherines as usual and there were cars crashed all along the QEW.  Guys driving 80 KPH when 30 was too fast....  I never count on spring being here till May, and then it's sometimes doubtful too."
