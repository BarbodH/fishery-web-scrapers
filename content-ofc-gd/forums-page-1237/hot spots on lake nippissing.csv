58374,Marc Thorpe,2007-04-11 10:15:00,621,"Dont have any hot spots,but I would recommend you and your dad or mom spend a day on the water with Rob Hyatt or Dany Columby if you regularly visit the area. They are very familliar with Nippising,I suspect you would learn alot from both these guys and enjoy your day  Rob Hyatt http://www.robsfishingcharters.com/  Dany Columby http://www.nipissingmuskies.com/  Might be others on the board which may provide further help"

Smallmouth fishing can be excellent at certain times when they come in fairly shallow! Spinnerbaits, Crankbaits, Grubs, Tubes, WHATEVER! Have fun because fishing there can be absolutely silly."
