58313,Jen,2007-04-11 02:50:00,833,"I had the same problem for a  while as well and found this works just as well as using photo  bucket.  Select the pictures you want to post. Send them to yourself in an email...xp will ask if you want to make pictures smaller say yes. Then open your email, copy the pictures to your desktop, Hit browse button in the area below the screen you type in on here Choose to go to desktop, pick the picture you want Hit the upload button The program will put the photos in your attachements file (there is a box right above the browse button that says attachments) If you click on the drop down menu in that box it will show you what pictures you have up loaded You will see a green + beside the picture on top of a page and a red x , click on the green + and the link to your picture will appear in text in the box above.  To check that you have done it all right , choose preview message."

This is NOT the page that the image is on...it is found in the properties of the picture by right clicking on the image and selecting 'properties'. The correct URL will end in a file type like .jpg (or alternatively .jpeg, .png or .gif). You all have very easy to use photo albums right here and they are available to you in your My Controls area."
