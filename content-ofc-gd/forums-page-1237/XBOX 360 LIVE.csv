57861,Terry,2007-04-10 13:39:00,14456,I'm still playing with the xbox..maybe when I get a HDTV I will switch to the xbox 360  I hope the new ghost recon comes out on the regular xbox..I like my modd chip and big hard drive
57878,LeXXington,2007-04-10 14:20:00,1928,"No such luck Terry, you want the new games have to get the X360..  I prefer Ghost Recon on the computer, the Xbox version was very crappy..  Go HALO II"
57895,Abberz,2007-04-10 14:48:00,140,"Mines AbBoTtRoS.  I play Tiger 07, NHL 07 and a few others on LIVE.  360 is a great system!"
57899,tonyb,2007-04-10 14:55:00,1637," Booo! NHL 07, you should have bought NHL 2K7, it's a better hockey sim than NHL 07, plus you get Harry Neale as a commentator  Those darn yanks can't call a hockey game for the life of them.  Tony"
57910,LeXXington,2007-04-10 15:19:00,1928,Does the US version have the puck that comes with the red streak so they can see it..
57913,blaque,2007-04-10 15:24:00,2419,Hey what about Rick Jeanerette.......that guy even gets Cherry and Mcleans' attention
58067,GbayGiant,2007-04-10 20:17:00,1780,"I'm surprised more people don't play the PC games, you can get controllers just like Xbox, play the same games with better graphics and you don't have to buy a Xbox ?"
58075,charlied,2007-04-10 20:28:00,584,I doubt a computer game has better graphice than xbox360....but you never know! Guys my gamertag is  steelhead7845...add me as a friend if you want!
58087,tonyb,2007-04-10 20:50:00,1637,"GB, I can sit my lazy ass on the couch and enjoy the explosions on a 42"" T.V. when I play, instead of being hunched over a keyboard and 19"" monitor.  Also, I never have to worry about upgrading my graphics card, or RAM to play the latest game.  Don't even get me started on installation times, driver searces, and updates/patches  I used to play Counterstrike tons on the PC, but it is much more enjoyable playing games on the surround sound set-up.  Tony"
58122,GbayGiant,2007-04-10 21:58:00,1780," Yes, I can see the advantages on the 360, but the PC definitely has better graphics if you have a good graphics card and tons of ram. You can hook you PC to a big screen TV to if you wanted with a wireless keyboard and controller, lol.  I've played the 360 and have compared graphics . The 360 will eventually just be a PC anyway,lol, every year it just gets closer to a computer, with more ram, Internet capabilities etc..  I guess Bill just wanted something a little different to sell.  Oh, and my PC is hooked up to a sterio system to for the surround sound."
