57299,bigfish1965,2007-04-09 05:05:00,3382,"One of my pet project web sites won a Golden Web Award as one of the top sites on the internet for March/April '07. From the award presentation certificate....    My business site has been shut out two years in a row, but this one won first try. Clearly I am doing something very wrong and very right at the same time. The award is for design and not traffic, obviously, since the site has a very narrow potential readership."

I won one a few years ago (Back before CSS was the mainstay) and I remember the joy I felt as well to be recognized, which is difficult amongst 1,000,000,000,000,000? other websites out there... it was for a dss site I ran.. I was pleased with the award as well... and there is noone as deserving as you to receive one. Do you still get to display the Golden Cup on your site?  keep me in the loop! it has been a few years!
