56266,Bob Devine,2007-04-06 22:59:00,251,"Despite COLD weather the fishing is heating up on the Detroit River. Earlier in the week with a full moon, a gentle breeze and warm temps walleye fishing was doing very well. Strong winds and cold temps have not slowed the bite much. Went out today Arpil 6 and was greeted with a wind chill of 14 degrees and water temps cooling to 38 degrees, but it did not stop the walleyes from co-operating. It seems many of the larger fish are currently on the Ontario side of the Detroit River with smaller eaters thrown in. While on the Mich side many of those 18""-20"" fish are being caught. Most are using chartruese colored jigs with a plastic minnow as a trailer. "

56349,taper,2007-04-07 02:07:00,611,Nice catch. I want to try my luck on the Detroit river one of these days.
56393,terzaghi,2007-04-07 03:17:00,12,"with this cold weather the fish are near warm water discharges from power plants.  I was out this morning as well.  I was at the north end, were the fish must of been hiding.  It was so cold, everything was covered in ice including me.    Gulp minnows and finn-s minnows are working wonders with heavy jigs.  "
56497,Smokey,2007-04-07 14:21:00,1278,Nice fish. Congrats.

56541,BLACKFISH88,2007-04-07 16:59:00,191,Yummy! nice eyes bud I also like the fact that it's not a white bucket LOL!
56542,ryanheritage,2007-04-07 17:07:00,180,Great job!! nice eyes! Thats so weird that you fished the detroit river recently... last night I was watching pete bowman fishin the detriot for eyes on TV. He explained the 24 fishing license for michigan and everything... I guess its a good river for them there eyes...  I always thought that the detroit river was a nasty river that three eyed scaless fish swam in? I gota make my way now and try out that river (and some windsor casino's) lol
56553,Zib,2007-04-07 17:33:00,369,"Bob,  Not sure who you heard your report of the Michigan side giving up only the small ones but they are wrong. Plenty of big ones being caught in the Trenton Channel last weekend when I was out there. Biggest one caught was in an FLW tourney at over 12 LB female. I seen a few boats pulling in 7 & 8 pounders. Even had one guy pull in a 6 Lb male. My biggest was only 19.5 inches but I did catch a Master Angler White Sucker.  For those thinking of fishing the Detroit River next weekend, keep this in mind. There will be 2 tournaments going on & the week after that there will be a Cabela's tourney going on as well. For those fishing the Ontario side you won't have to worry about the tourney guys because they are limited to only Michigan waters due to the VHS disease.  Here's a pic of last weeks tourney caught on the Michigan side of the river:  "
56658,muskiebobsr,2007-04-07 23:21:00,49,"Bob I haven't had a chance to listen to your interview with Dave ""Hoggie"" Hoggard yet but I will this week.  Leaving a week from Tuesday for a Muskie trip to Kentucky's Green River.  Oh nice fish by the way.  Bob"
57000,lunkerbasshunter,2007-04-08 18:20:00,2585,"man its going to be a long wait till may opener thanks for rubbing it in,  lol nice catch though!"
57146,Joey,2007-04-08 23:32:00,9122,"Mmmmmmm, looks good.  We had some guys on the Niagara tell us they were catching pickerel today.  They said bows and pickerel at the same time in the same place.  Joey"
57293,terzaghi,2007-04-09 04:30:00,12,fish were biting at peche island last i heard.  The wind has made it near impossible to fish the last 4 days.  there has  been fish taken on the american side near alter rd.
57338,Zib,2007-04-09 12:37:00,369, Ya I know a guy that caught a few off of Peach & some other guys that did good out of Alter Rd this past Friday & Saturday. Some real die hard guys to go out in that cold. They said they had to chip some ice off the boat.  Also heard guys caught a few by the salt hills & Trenton channel.
57344,Chrispy,2007-04-09 13:04:00,168,Me and CastMaster went out of LaSalle on Friday for a couple hours....it was really cold out there!!!!  Only managed one nice male around 2.5 pounds but if we would have stayed there we would have picked up more.....they are all over the river right now and it is going to really heat up in the next couple weeks!!!!  Come on down to the area and get into some walleye!!!!   Chrispy!
57501,bucktail,2007-04-09 20:23:00,1857,Thinking opf coming down to Windsor in the next few weeks. Where is the best place to launch. Have only visited the casino before ;-)
57845,Chrispy,2007-04-10 12:30:00,168,"Bucktail, the best would be City Marina  http://www.citywindsor.ca/002001.asp  You can google it for directions.....from there just look to see where the boats are.....you have to have an electric trolling motor or a kicker.....When you are jigging you MUST stay as vertical as possible or you won't catch walleye!!  You can shoot me an e-mail when you are coming and I will let you  know where we are catching fish.....   Chrispy!"
