57867,Terry,2007-04-10 14:01:00,14456,review on the Olympus SP-550 Ultra Zoom  I think it's a real nice one
57873,LeXXington,2007-04-10 14:12:00,1928,For a point and shoot can't go wrong with the Canon A640 10mp.  Bigger the zoom the bigger the camera. I like something that fits in a pocket and takes movies..  The only real reason I went for the big MP is when zooming in digitally makes a big difference. When printing out on paper no difference at all
57902,glirw,2007-04-10 14:59:00,200,"Alot of good information here already !  To the OP , you say you want alot of zoom and a large LCD . Are you going with the assumption that bigger is better ? Alot of people make the mistake these days of underestimating the cameras that are small and fit into your pocket . The smaller cameras these days take awesome shots , and usually have quite large LCDs !  I don't know what your purposes are with this new camera , but if they are day to day photography of fish , family , scenery, and other random objects then a large sized cam with alot of zoom might end up being nothing more than a nuisance and a headache to carry ! I have seen it first hand .  Just something to keep in mind."
57905,Headhunter,2007-04-10 15:01:00,5703,"Here's my take on the point and shoots. I'd choose a few models that I'm interested in, perhaps some of the suggestions you've laready received. I'd then go to a store that sells them and try each one out! My biggest beef with point and shoot cameras is the speed of the processor. In other words, the time it takes between me pushing the ""shoot"" button, and the camera actually doing it's thing and taking the shot! I find my target has already left, before the camera takes it shot! I'm hoping that the newer ones are much faster than my two year old Nikon. HH PS... Blacks has all of their digital cameras on sale right now and they will price match for three months after purchase."
57936,bassmaster4,2007-04-10 16:10:00,801,http://www.imaging-resource.com/PRODS/FE180/FE180A.HTM  OLYMPUS FE-180 got it in November 2006 works great never gone fishign with it yet becuase i forgot it each time but it works great for me looks pretty good too lol bought it at Costco in ancaster for 200 bones
57938,taper,2007-04-10 16:11:00,611,"In response to KTFO i wanted the same type of camera, not because it was better I just found the larger viewer much easier to review pictures. We take a lot of wildlife shots and the zoom makes a huge difference when trying to get a picture of a moose on shore from your boat 200 ft away. I was going to get a smaller camera for the fish pictures in the boat but then I would lose out on the farther away shots."
58199,mepps,2007-04-11 00:18:00,1301,"Got a Canon G5 and an S2 here, love em both.  Take a look at Olympus rugged outdoor line up - they have cameras that function under water..."
58200,bucktail,2007-04-11 00:21:00,1857,"You might want to look at the Olympus 720. Its waterproof to 10 feet and shockproof, perfect for in the boat!"
57719,Pigeontroller,2007-04-10 01:45:00,2793,"I plan on buying my first Digital camera soon. I want a point and shoot, lots of zoom and a 2.5 "" LCD.  Anyone have anything to recomend?"
57726,Dondorfish,2007-04-10 01:54:00,1000,Love my canon - It has 10 times optical zoom - but the new ones have 12 times.  I also see that olympus has a 18 times zoom out   Don
57728,BFSC Kevin,2007-04-10 01:54:00,1351,i don't know an exact model but i highly recommend canon products. helped me win a few photographer awards.
57730,taper,2007-04-10 01:56:00,611,"I just purchased the Sony Cybershot DSC-H5 and absolutely love it. 12 times zoom,7.2 mega pixel, 3 inch LCD screen and image stabilization."
57734,Roy,2007-04-10 01:57:00,13728,I now use a Sony DSC-H2  12X. I'm happy with it.
57735,Roy,2007-04-10 01:58:00,13728,I now use a Sony DSC-H2  12X. I'm happy with it.
57747,Ron,2007-04-10 02:11:00,1683,We heard you the first time Roy. Try and keep this one out of the ice hole though!
57749,TennesseeGuy,2007-04-10 02:16:00,957,"Yep, Roy, you're getting just like me.  Doing things twice except for the one thing you'd really like to do twice."
57754,irishfield,2007-04-10 02:26:00,26272,"Dax...my wife bought me the Canon Powershot A540 for Christmas. I really like it and a BIG step up from my Kodax 210Plus. It's 6 megapixal and 4 x optical zoom. I'd love some more zoom on it...but it's simple to operate in auto. Has appature and speed priority, manual settings, portrait, landscape, night setting etc. that I still need to figure out. Also does short video clips (1 minute on high definition and longer on lower settings)."
57756,Joey,2007-04-10 02:32:00,9122,"I just got the Canon Powershot A430, 4 megapixels, 4x optical zoom and I love it.  I got it with 1800 airmiles reward miles so didn't really cost me a thing.  Takes great pics, but like Wayne, I need to learn alot more about all the functions.  But it takes good fish pics so that's all I care about  Joey"
57766,danc,2007-04-10 02:50:00,4677,"Sony's newest ""H"" series camera is due out soon, the H9. 15x optical zoom amongst other bells and whistles."
57768,Roy,2007-04-10 02:57:00,13728,You're skeerin' me Dan.
57769,bigfish1965,2007-04-10 03:02:00,3382,Canon S2IS  and S3 IS are great cameras. Get a tripod if you are using huge zoom like 10X or more. You need the hands of a brain surgeon and that level of zoom.
57776,danc,2007-04-10 03:19:00,4677,  I won't be getting an H9 anytime soon Roy. I've got my mind set on a rather expensive GPS at the moment. I like my electronic toys. Darn microchips anyways!!
57779,Roy,2007-04-10 03:20:00,13728,Which are you getting Dan?
57780,Heybud_e,2007-04-10 03:22:00,208,i have a fujifilm finepix A400... not bad for the money i spent....
57788,danc,2007-04-10 03:40:00,4677, I'll be getting a Garmin GPSMAP 60CSx. I've done my research and this is the one that I want. I have to wait to see how our contract vote goes first though. April 21st. I don't want to spend that kind of money and then find myself on the picket line a week later. We'll see how it goes.
57789,Forester,2007-04-10 04:15:00,46,"canon is pretty good! I got the A700IS for 400 bucks!It uses two AA batteries,so you don't need to worry about recharge the battery. I got a 2G SD Card at TigerDirect for about 25 bucks! BTW,I don't like SONY!"
57790,Forester,2007-04-10 04:17:00,46,"Here is a good website for reviews ,lots of info.  http://www.imaging-resource.com/MFR1.HTM"
57797,Northhunter,2007-04-10 05:41:00,214,"I got dis one    Casio Exilim. 6.0 megapixels, 2.5"" screen. About the size of a credit card and half an inch thick. I have big hands but the size doesn't make it hard to use.  I know some people are probably thinking Casio? but it's an awesome camera. My model only has 3x optical zoom, but the newer ones go higher. Has image stabilization, all kinds of colour/brightness/contrast settings as well as a ""Best Shot"" button for ""point and click"". Definetly go with lithium batteries. I put a 2gig memory card in mine and can take close to 30mins of HQ video without swapping for the spare. They charge in under an hour.  I picked it up last June and think it was about 300 bones or a bit more? But it came with a bunch of throw-ins so was a pretty good deal."
57829,Bob,2007-04-10 11:26:00,370,"Whatever you decide on, look for the new models to come out and buy last year's model.  I have a Fuji S5200 and I love it, 5MP and 10x zoom but if I had waited a few months, I would have saved $150.00."
57834,pigeonfisher,2007-04-10 12:01:00,696,Sony Cybershot...Choose your options and spend whatever you want.  $250-$$$$  They take great photos and are very easy to use.
57835,Mike the Pike,2007-04-10 12:06:00,3421,"Canon, easy to use and no distortion.My friend and my sister have cameras that cost $100 more than my Canon A-530 they have well known brands yet have to often deal with fuzzy pictures out of focus.Canon is user friendly for those people who do not have a steady hand.Costco had some good deals.Good Luck with the purchase."
57842,Raf,2007-04-10 12:21:00,3495,"Panasonic DMC-FZ7 is what I recently bought.  Leica lens, 12x opti-zoom, IS.  My jittery hands can take pics with the IS at max zoom easily and the IS helps in low-light conditions too.  "
57863,David Chong,2007-04-10 13:49:00,836,"Glad to see that you're enjoying your new camera, Raf! Pigeon Troller & all OFNers out there looking for any type of camera equipment, I've been in this business for almost 30 years I will get you the best price possible. Feel free to contact me at [emailÂ protected] The Canon S3IS and Panasonic FZ7 are both great cameras and you couldn't go wrong with either one!
