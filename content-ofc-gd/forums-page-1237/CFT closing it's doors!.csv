58135,finfan,2007-04-10 22:31:00,44,Just found out the CFT will be closing it's doors. They claim there's not enough angler support and it's just not financially viable to continue with running the circuit. Any comments from fellow OFNers?  I'd like to properly make my introduction to the OFC family I'm the finfan and a newby to this site. I've been reading some of the discussions and it's really nice to see such a tightly knit group on OFC. I know I'm going to enjoy this alot and make new friends in the process! This is my first posting and I want to say hello to everyone out there.
