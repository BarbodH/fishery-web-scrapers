57918,Whopper,2007-04-10 15:32:00,2174, I'll second that!
57930,taper,2007-04-10 16:01:00,611,I'll take them but I told Fins I couldn't get there until the weekend. I forgot to say FinS that I could send an email money transfer if you will hold them for me to pick up or we can see about shipping. If you are looking for a face to face sale before the weekend then by all means do so. I am on my way to work but if you reply to this or PM me I will get it when I get home. If you wish to do the money transfer leave me a contact number for the evenings and I will call from work.
