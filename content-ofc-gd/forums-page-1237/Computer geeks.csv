57906,Terry,2007-04-10 15:02:00,14456,"sender would block a guy at say, rogers.com domain would block everyone at rogers.com"
57908,OhioFisherman,2007-04-10 15:05:00,6623,"Thanks Terry, I don`t even open them to see what domain they are from so I probably don`t want to do that. Want to see some viagra ads?"

57911,bigfish1965,2007-04-10 15:20:00,3382,"You're better off with an email client that has a 'smart' filtering system for spam. These filters scan the headers, senders and content of email and assign it as spam if it meets your criteria and sends it to the spam folder. Spammers often use spoofed email addresses or dynamic IP addies, so trying to block by sender is often a waste of time."
