58011,Headhunter,2007-04-10 18:10:00,5703,"Hey folks, lookin for some advice here. I know I have to change the venting system on my clothes dryer. I currently have a flexible plastic hose connecting the dryer to the outside. I understand I require a metal pipe these days, just wondering if it must be a ridgid metal pipe or can I use the flexible metal piping I've found at Candian Tire? Thanks all! HH"
58014,Joey,2007-04-10 18:15:00,9122,Why do you have to change it?  You need a metal pipe now?  Joey
58016,Headhunter,2007-04-10 18:18:00,5703,"Joey, I believe that in order to pass a ""home inspection"", I must have the dryer vented, to code and I believe that you are not allowed to use the plastic piping anymore because of fire hazard? HH"
58017,BITEME,2007-04-10 18:19:00,1969,i use rigid i find the flexable gathers to much lint and crap im not even sure about the flex any more
58021,Joey,2007-04-10 18:33:00,9122,"Hmmm, interesting Joe.  Thanks.  God, soon they'll be telling us what kind of toilet paper we have to use in order that we don't chaffe ourselves, as that would add to the health care costs.  Okay, I'm done.  Joey"
58022,Bitsmith2k,2007-04-10 18:33:00,396,just had my home inspected and the inspector said i need to replace the plastic vent as well.. i asked him and he did say that the flex pipe is sufficient for code..
58031,Headhunter,2007-04-10 18:45:00,5703,Thanks Mike! That will certainly say me some installation time! LOL Joey! Cheers all! HH
58038,Rob,2007-04-10 18:59:00,467,"Aluminum pipe (so it won't rust) no more than 3 - 90 degree elbows and a styrofoam wraped exhaust vent. I just replaced mine and a buddy of mine who is a tinbanger, recommended this to me and is what I did! Seems to work great so far. So I hope this helps,  Rob C"
58115,danc,2007-04-10 21:35:00,4677,"Definitely go with solid pipe over flex, but going aluminum is an unnecessary expense. Galvanized pipe will last a couple of decades at least at a much cheaper cost. I took apart and cleaned the lint out of my galvanized dryer vent last summer and after 18 years, it's as good as new. A tinbanger friend of mine told me to do this."
58121,troutologist,2007-04-10 21:55:00,951,go with the galvenized.  then if they change the regs you are still fine. the flex pipe accumulates lint way faster anyways.
58124,Gerritt,2007-04-10 22:03:00,6129,"Stick with the Alum Flex pipe... it will pass, dont go through the added expense of rigid... your selling the place anyways!  Gerritt."
