474091,Rawbb,2010-06-09 17:05:00,1,"Hi Everyone,  Im going up to Lake Nipissing next week (West Arm) - Cache Bay area, and was wondering how the fishing is? Does anyone know what the water levels are like, and what I can try and catch over there?   Also, what lures/techniques should I try and use to target Pike and/or Walleye.  Any assistance would be greatly appreciated."
