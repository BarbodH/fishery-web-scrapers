473417,Devious,2010-06-07 23:08:00,49,"Got out fishing with a couple buddies for the opener on Saturday. Bite was pretty good in the morning, managed to land one fish and lost another on a massive jump (highest ive ever seen a fish jump out of the water...3+ft easy).  Other then that I had one other fish follow but couldn't get him to bite. After that the wind picked up and the fishing slowed down considerably.  All fish hooked were on the Sebile stick shad, my new favorite lure now I should add  Heres a pic of the one fish we landed, a 35 incher.  Hope every one had a fun time fishing this weekend!  "
