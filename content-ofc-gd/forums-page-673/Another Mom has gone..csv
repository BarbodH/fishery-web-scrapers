473500,Fisherman,2010-06-08 02:03:00,7201,"Well today was the day, like many before, I got that call that pretty much emotionally cripples you.  After almost 93 years on this globe, nature has taken our mother.  In the last couple weeks her physical condition was deteriorating and the fine nurses at the old folks home gave my brother and I the nod that it was coming.  Fortunately, she still had her wits about her and quite coherent.  My thanks for making it a pleasant stay at the Guildwood Nursing home go to the fine staff and, to my only and older brother who for many, many years and countless hours, took care of Mom both at home and gave her the extra quality of life in her last years at the nursing home.  Mothers aren't forever, go visit yours soon."
473504,irishfield,2010-06-08 02:06:00,26272,"God Speed to your Mother Fisherman! She lived a nice long life, with a couple of lads to be proud of I'm sure!  The last line's the truth!"

473514,splashhopper,2010-06-08 02:21:00,2931,"93 years is a pretty amazing journey... I am sure you will have many memories of her tales to share with the great grandchildren some day.  And a little reminder prayer for the next few days to think about for you:  ""Lord make me a channel of thy peace -- that where there is hatred, I may bring love -- that where there is wrong, I may bring the spirit of forgiveness -- that where there is discord, I may bring harmony -- that where there is error, I may bring truth -- that where there is doubt, I may bring faith -- that where there is despair, I may bring hope -- that where there are shadows, I may bring light -- that where there is sadness, I may bring joy.  Lord, grant that I may seek rather to comfort than to be comforted -- to understand, than to be understood -- to love, than to be loved.  For it is by self-forgetting that one finds. It is by forgiving that one is forgiven. It is by dying that one awakens to Eternal Life...  AMEN"
