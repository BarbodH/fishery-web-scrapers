474034,NAW,2010-06-09 13:53:00,4022,  DANG.  I just changed my name!  Add one more thing to my long list of new documents required..
474039,Viking,2010-06-09 14:04:00,39, My experience with both MTO for trailer registration and Service Canada for boat registration was real simple. I was amazed at how easy they made it. The people I dealt with were great. I bought a boat motor and trailer off a friend who passed away before everything got changed over to my name. His wife couldn't find any paper work for anything. MTO called the trailer homemade and gave me a VIN# to stamp on it (couldn't locate the # on the trailer) and an ownership. Put my plate on it and that was it. Service Canada couldn't find the boat in their system with the registration number I gave them off the boat so they just issued me a registration with that # and that was that. Neither office could find anything listed in the previous owners name but went ahead and transfered it to me anyway. I did have a copy of his death cert and bill of sale from his wife. Under the circumstances I was amazed at how easy they made it. I thought I was going to need a notorized affidavit and fight with them over it but they didn't even flinch. I'd just go an try to register it with as much info on the boat and trailer as you can get.
474045,fish-miester,2010-06-09 14:18:00,864, awesome thanks!

474267,pikehunter,2010-06-10 01:20:00,1659,"Life is getting to be a real pain in the   We're being regulated to death!  So lets see, we need proof of registration, proof of purchase, a boat operator license, a fishing license, a drivers license for photo ID, a passport if fishing along the border, a health card, a credit card just in case, a Pioneer gas card to collect your points, s Sobey's grocery card in case we get hungry, a AAA/CAA card, and oh ya, a Casino Rama players card if we happen to be fishing on Couchching or Lake St. John so we can pop in and give a donation to the 1 armed bandit.  Did I forget any?"
474277,Viking,2010-06-10 01:32:00,39,Air Miles card. Don't want to miss out.
474283,ctdd2006,2010-06-10 01:42:00,531," Here's an interesting twist!  A buddy of mine with no license (dui) wrote the test(while under suspension) and passed, and is now the ""proud"" holder of an operators card (still under drivers suspension)!  I'm assuming...he operating his boat in possession of his new card, birth certificate and health card keeps him legal?  I can't find where it says driver's license must accompany the ""operator's"" card but the judge clearly stated not to operate any ""motorized"" vehicles when he was sentenced....i'm guessing if he gets pulled over on the water here where the mnr and opp are without radios he walks???  What do you think?  This has been a brown bottle discussion for two months now!"
474288,Rattletrap2,2010-06-10 02:05:00,1652,"A few years back, I scanned a copy of my vessel registration and printed it out on a colour printer. I had it laminated at Staples to keep it waterproof. I now carry this document, my pleasure craft operators card, and fishing licenses! I carry the trailer ownership with the tow vehicle.  Starting to be a real pain on a hot summers day when all you want to do is jump in the boat with a bathing suit on to go fishing! I have very limited dry storage space."
474290,John Bacon,2010-06-10 02:13:00,3277, It wouldn't make sense to require a boater to carry their driver's license when they are boating because you don't need a drivers license to operate a boat.  People under 16 can get a boaters card even though they are too young to drive a car.  That doesn't necessarily make it legal for your buddy to drive a boat... I am sure there is a law against disobeying a court order.  I am not sure if the OPP would normally check that.
474332,ctdd2006,2010-06-10 04:18:00,531,  My point exactly!  We all make mistakes and trust this guy fully to take my kid fishing with him tomorrow....but the question remains if it's legal!?
474336,Sinker,2010-06-10 04:32:00,8692,"Try going hunting, with your boat in tow. Pretty soon I'm going to have a big folder to carry all my crap to be legal.  Wanna know the worste part about it?? I've never been asked for any of it!!  Been stopped many, many times. Never asked for boat registration, or gun registration. Never even been asked to see my gun license for god sakes. They look at my outdoors card, and check my safety gear, and have a nice day.  Over regulated, under enforced.......such a crock of crap!!!  S."
474350,TroutnMuskieHunter,2010-06-10 10:57:00,1362,I'm confused as well after reading this thread....we bought a pontoon boat back in 1994 and got it registered...how the hell would anyone know that you need to renew it now every 10 years
474361,Fisherman,2010-06-10 12:22:00,7201,"Well it's all the nice people here that find things for you on the internet and post them just to see your colour change to red and blood pressure go up.    Once a year or so I go to the MNR website and check for any updates, then Transport Canada Marine for any boating rule/safety updates, you get the picture.."
474369,TroutnMuskieHunter,2010-06-10 12:39:00,1362, I always check the MNR website for updates because MNR constantly have changes in fishing dates and other regulations.....But I remember asking the clerk at Transport Canada back in 1994 if we had to renew the vessel permit and he said it's good for as long as you own the vessel...  ....very similar to my ATV plate which is good for the duration of me owning it without having to renew
474386,Viking,2010-06-10 14:11:00,39,"until this thread I didn't know you needed to renew registration either. As far as proof of ownership does anyone really care unless they think you stole the boat? I think we can all relax though, soon enough we'll get notices in the mail to renew boaters cards, boat registration etc.....of course it will come with instructions on how to pay the new fees as well. I'm sure its just matter of time. As far as the guy with the suspended license. I don't know. I'm kinda of the opinion that you don't need a drivers license to drive a boat so why should it affect your boat license. But I don't know. If you were impaired operating your boat I'd bet they would take your drivers license though."
474388,asdve23rveavwa,2010-06-10 14:35:00,2690,One of the reasons I asked the original question.  Why need proof of ownership if your name is on the license form???????
474394,Viking,2010-06-10 14:50:00,39,Oh I completely agree. If there was a question of who owns the boat why would they let you register it in your name? It really seems like a stupid system but at least we're not being charged for it. If or maybe when they change it guaranteed it will cost us money
473904,asdve23rveavwa,2010-06-09 01:29:00,2690,"Okay, guys...somebody clear this one up, please.  When boating is it necessary to have a proof of ownership, as well as your pleasure craft license and boaters card? Thanks!"
473905,Lostchild,2010-06-09 01:33:00,153,Never used to be but yes you need both now.
473907,tdotfisherman,2010-06-09 01:34:00,317,"Ya.. I should probably know the answer to this.. I always carry my fishing license with me, and boating license.. but I have no ownership or anything for the boat I bought a year ago.  It was a cash deal with a buddy's uncle.. and I didn't get a bill of sale or anything..  anyone wanna advise me on the legal thing to do.. thx!"
473908,asdve23rveavwa,2010-06-09 01:38:00,2690,That is what I thought as well...is a bill of sale proof enough?
473910,irishfield,2010-06-09 01:39:00,26272,If the boat has more than 10HP on it.. it is a requirement to be carrying a copy of the matching paper vessel registration for the numbers on the boat. $300 fine for failure to show ! Under 10 HP.. no registration.. no need to carry proof of ownership.
473911,Guest gbfisher,2010-06-09 01:39:00,0,Yes you need your ownership with you. I carry two.   I ask first which they would rather see....a photo copy of the original or the real McCoy. Why you may ask?...  ..cause the OPP like the MNR can't seem to get on track about what you need. Some OPP say you need a photo copy while the others...  say different. So I ask first and give them what they want....
473912,NANUK,2010-06-09 01:40:00,797,"Proof of ownership is required, You don't have to carry the orignal, a photo copy is acceptable."
473913,irishfield,2010-06-09 01:42:00,26272, I hear you Andy.. but if they can tell the difference between an original and a photocopy off my HP 3390 I'll eat my hat! Besides... all Service Canada is doing now is printing them off what ever tax payers printer they have at hand!
473915,Guest gbfisher,2010-06-09 01:45:00,0, I guess if ya trim the paper down to size.......I'll have three now...lol How much ya wanna bet I get a ticket for having more than one.
473916,irishfield,2010-06-09 01:49:00,26272,"LOL.. like I said, all the new ones are just a full sheet of 8.5 x 11 folded in half! They don't use the old forms they had to hand write on anymore.  Hell.. change the spacing in your address and get a brand new one!"
473919,spinnerbaitking,2010-06-09 01:57:00,1622,"Went to Service Canada in Walkerton a couple weeks ago, about 10 minutes & no cash it's free, I'm legal now & need to renew in 10 years, bill of sale & Registration numbers was all I needed Richard"
473920,Fisherman,2010-06-09 01:57:00,7201,"Not to wander off the original question but, darned if you don't find something new that's going to bite some people in the wallet. Got it from the Transport Canada/Marine Division site, I think you may have to renew regardless if there's an info amendment,  here goes: Recent amendments to the Small Vessel Regulations have resulted in the following changes to the Pleasure Craft Licensing Process:  *  Owners of licensed pleasure craft now have up to 90 days from the date of purchase to transfer a pleasure craft licence. During which time you may continue to operate your pleasure craft with the existing licence and a copy of the transfer documents onboard. *  Pleasure craft licences are valid for a period of 10 years. If there are changes to your name or address in that time, you must update your licence by applying to Service Canada.  Service Canada delivers Pleasure Craft Licensing at all of their offices across Canada"
473922,irishfield,2010-06-09 02:00:00,26272,Yep.. they claim the 10 year requirement to renew is to keep updated information in the event of finding an overturned boat or the likes! But you know it's really a plan to start charging for transfers.. kinda like that FREE gun registry started out!
473924,Fisherman,2010-06-09 02:03:00,7201,Well I guess I'll print off the PDF version and go to town to get my new one.
473926,kyle7273,2010-06-09 02:10:00,65,So what kinda trouble are they going to give me when I bring an old boat from our camp in New Brunswick with no papers and want to register it? Can I go in and say I have an old boat that was never registered but I would like to bring it all up to date now?
473930,asdve23rveavwa,2010-06-09 02:15:00,2690,"In my case my motor is 15 hp...so definitely the pleasure craft license permit, but, I could have swore I read that the ownership was necessary as well.  Now I'm looking closely at this document and it does have the hull ID # of the boat, the length and description plus my name on it...however it also states that it is not a title document."
473931,irishfield,2010-06-09 02:18:00,26272,"You will have to print their document and go to a Notary to have stamped/signed to swear you own the boat, before they will issue registration for it. Mind you.. if it has numbers on it now, then they should be able to search the registration and print you a new one anyhow!"
473937,irishfield,2010-06-09 02:26:00,26272," In most of our cases.. we are actually licencing out boats, not registering them. Registering is when you register a name for the vessel and generally done on much larger vessels.. like the HMS Tom Coffin etc. The licence 29E23456 etc is not a ""title"", but is all that is needed to show ""ownership"" to the OPP when being spot checked.  Service Canada website for those that need the declarion under oath to get things legal.  http://www.servicecanada.gc.ca/eng/sc/boats/pcl.shtml  Also note that when trailering, it's a good idea to have a copy of the trailer ownership and pleasure craft licence in the tow vehicle... as the OPP are asking to see both now when you get pulled over. A great effort to try and curb theft! (and it will save you from undoing that trailering cover and trying to find the glove box!)"
473939,asdve23rveavwa,2010-06-09 02:29:00,2690,"Thanks, Wayne!  Was second guessing myself on this one.  Now I've got to dig up my trailer ownership...think it is buried in my glovebox somewhere."
473941,Viking,2010-06-09 02:33:00,39,I was told real recently by Service Canada that proof of registration was not proof of ownership. You need your bill of sale to prove ownership. They advised carrying both. Plus your pleasure craft card. Seems kinda silly to me. Almost need a filing cabinet on board to carry all the documentation.
473944,asdve23rveavwa,2010-06-09 02:38:00,2690,"ARRRRRRRRRRRRGHHHHH   Maybe we need to contact the OPP, or Ministry to try and get a straight answer...the pleasure craft license document seems to have all the necessary information.  If they are checking to see if a boat is stolen."
474007,fish-miester,2010-06-09 13:04:00,864,"Now Im confused what to do, I inherited my boat from my grandfather who past away about 3 years ago. the boat is a 14' with a 9.9 and well I heard I dont need any paper work for the boat as its under 10hp but what about the trailer that was given with the boat? what do I need to do with that. as well as what do I do as I am looking at getting a used 25hp for my boat because I would then be over the 10hp no paper limit.  any information would be appreciated"
474009,Raf,2010-06-09 13:08:00,3495,you need a ownership (and plate obviously) for the trailer -- from the MTO.  you'll need a vessel license if you stick the 25 on it -- from Service Canada.
474013,davew3,2010-06-09 13:21:00,430,"Just to be safe have boating license, fishing license, ownership, insurance, registration, and one piece of photo id. If that does not satisfy them then there is not much that would."
474027,smally21,2010-06-09 13:43:00,993,"the word ownership keeps coming up.  there is no such thing as an ownership for a boat, while there are registration and licensing documents.  a bill of sale signed and dated by you and the seller is about the closest thing that qualifies.  a big hole in the process if you ask me."
