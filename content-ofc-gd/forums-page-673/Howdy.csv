I live in the Ottawa area and fish mainly bass around Ottawa and on the Quebec side. We have our camp on a small Quebec lake loaded with huge SMB so I will be posting lots of pics and reports during bass season. My fishing buddy is my son who's 7 and he also handles the camera since he doesn't like to hold the fish just yet. Also fish for Walleye, pike and the occasional Musky trip up the Rideau river which is 10 minutes from my home. You have a great site here and I look forward to contributing. thanks, Brufan"
