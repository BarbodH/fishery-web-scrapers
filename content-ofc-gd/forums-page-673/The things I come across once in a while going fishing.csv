Pics are from river view,oooooouch!I hope he got out of it ok!  "
474270,pikehunter,2010-06-10 01:26:00,1659,That must have hurt. Looks like a familiar lower Grand River location. Wouldn't feel too bad about not assisting as it would have jeopardized your own safety and vehicle.
474274,vinnimon,2010-06-10 01:30:00,2593,  Exactly!And your right as well!
474449,alexcba,2010-06-10 17:05:00,634,"deffinetly dont feel bad. thats a crown vic! its just as heavy as some trucks, and the way its sitting there when you hook up to it you would have just cut the ground up from underneath him and then you both woulda needed the marine unit. feel bad for the guy but maybe he should have watched where he was going."
474474,TC1OZ,2010-06-10 17:50:00,987,"Damn.. Looks like he already tried gunning it out of there!!!   This is why I don't mind walking to my fishing spot, and I park in PARKING lots!"
474477,BillsTheBassMan,2010-06-10 17:55:00,932,"""The things I come across while Fishing.  Kinda funny, but not really pics.""  Reminds me of spot-checking trip with user Timmeh a few years back near his cottage.  We walk up to the bridge.  ""Anything?""  I ask.  ""Just some dude getting _ _________,"" Tim says.  I laugh it off and go to check the spot.  Yep, just some dude getting _ _________."
474478,fish-miester,2010-06-10 17:56:00,864,now I'm not familiar with the area.. but why would you park so close to the edge !?
474561,mbosh1980,2010-06-10 21:38:00,349,and that's why we have tow trucks
