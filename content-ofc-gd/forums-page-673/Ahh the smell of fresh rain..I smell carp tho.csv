474005,dsn,2010-06-09 13:02:00,1018,Woke up this morning and went out to balcony saw the rain coming down thought I'd smell the fresh scent of rain. Instead I smell carp. Guess its time to go carp fishing tomorrow. They are calling me by sending thier perfume my way.  And I'm no where close to a lake.  dsn
