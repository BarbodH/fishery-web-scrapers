Last year though I got hooked on muskie fishing for when I was trolling a 3 inch Husky Jerk I hooked a 55inch muskie.  I was able to land it and release it safely.  That exhilaration that came with hooking a fish that immense has never really left me all year and as I am about to make my way up to the French river I was wondering if anyone could provide me with some Muskie fishing tips for spring/early summer, recommend some lures and information on everything to do with muskie fishing  Thanks"

474153,BillsTheBassMan,2010-06-09 20:12:00,932,"Make sure you read up on how to handle and release Musky properly.  They're big, but very delicate.  Sometimes you need to allow a lot of time for revival.  I've been a big supporter of having a proper Catch-and-Release topic pinned to these boards for musky and all other species of fish, so please do your research before you end up on the water.

474190,trapshooter,2010-06-09 22:00:00,1234,Make sure you have the proper equipment to handle these fish too.  Stout rods and powerful reels.  I use 80lb no-stretch superline.  This ensures a quicker fight and hence less harm to the fish.  The long fights on light tackle is what will kill a muskie.  THey get tired out from a long fight then pulled out of the water and they're done for after that.  I've never fished the french so I can't help much with baits etc. but good luck and have fun.
