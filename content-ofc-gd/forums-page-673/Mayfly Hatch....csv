472862,JimC,2010-06-06 01:23:00,86,"I just returned from our annual week's vacation, fishing mostly the North West Hardwoods,  Pickerel Rock area of Lake Nipissing.   In many places, the water was thick with shadfly larvae; and there were lots of adults on the outside of our cottage.  We fished hard from Sat (May 29th) thru yesterday (Fri June 4th) ... two boats,  five fisherman,  and we didn't see our first Walleye till Wed. ... but what a beautiful 11 inch specimen she was! we got blanked on Thursday, then things seemed to start picking up yesterday, with a 13in,  15in,  and one 20in beauty that would have made enough for at least a decent dinner on our last night of vacation.   Missed at least two other solid Walleye hits, one right at the boat (I can still see that darn white tipped tail, as she spit the hook).  ...  BUT, despite being tempted to 'cheat' on that 20inch'er, especially, after seeing gill nets spread wide in one of our favourite spots around Umbrella Is.,  our buddies in the 2nd boat returned our ONE and only 'slot' Walleye for the week,  to swim another day ... probably right into that damn gill net we saw between the two orange-red marker buoys.   We were hoping for one more 15in 'keeper' but it wasn't to be.   So the five of us got a 'taste' but not a very filling one.  For the record, we were using that same chartreuse go-getter,  mentioned earlier in this thread among some pictures that I am very envious of. ;-)   We used gold ones too,  bottom bounced with jigs when there was a drift,  had some nice lively worms to tempt those Walleye, but I digress ... this thread is about 'Mayflys on Nipissing'  and we saw plenty.   I was born in North Bay,  living in S.Ont. now,  so I know 'plenty of shads'  when I see them.   I also know that the July 1st weekend is when the big hatch historically happens ... you didn't need a calender to tell what the date was over many years in The Bay.   The big heat of the last full week of May, shot the temps up and the little bug*ers came early (unlucky for us).  oh, we did get plenty of Pike action (and the usual sheephead, mudcats, a few bass (large, small, silver ... no rock), surprisingly only 'a few' Perch,  and we had the best weather we've seen in 15 years going to the same place this time of year.   Sure would have been nice to latch onto some nice 'eyes' but it wasn't to be ... I guess, we'll have to wait till next year."
473957,crosshairs,2010-06-09 03:31:00,55,"The orange floats you are refering to were probably from the cache bay pike derby that happened recently. They were run from the sturgeon river along the south side of pickerel rock. I also seen some around the bald rocks area.  At the depths around that area the floats from the nets would be all across the top. The nets generally are 6 feet wide, and are made to be suspended not sit on the bottom. Odds are there were no nets there. The only commercial fishing done is by Nipissing first nation, who have a their own management plan, biologist, enforcement, and assessment teams.  If I can fiqure out how to put pictures on here, I\ll post the pictures of the sturgeon we tagged last week in the sturgeon river. We inserted radio tags into 12 mature sturgeon, and will be tracking them for the next 5-6 years to establish patterns and areas of the lake they use. We have also pit tagged 300 plus juvenile sturgeon in the past couple years.  Anyhow I'm off topic, but good luck fishing to all."
474028,canadadude,2010-06-09 13:43:00,769,"An old nippising favorite is a yellow sally fly trolled or drifted behind a small spinner or june bug tipped with a piece of worm,use to be goto bait during the shadfly hatch."
474030,JimC,2010-06-09 13:45:00,86,"crosshairs ... thanks for clarifying the 'orange floats' (are they gill nets) question.   Now that I think about it,  we heard they had expanded the area for the Pike Derby due to extreme low water this year,  so it all makes sense now.  Also, since only the very occasional Walleye was being caught in the Pickerel Rock over to Hardwoods and beyond,  it wouldn't make sense for the First Nations to waste their netting time in those areas.   It seemed to us that Walleye in any numbers had long since left the shallow waters for their summer habitat (wherever that may be) by the time we got there (May 29th).  Cool comments regarding the Sturgeon ... I hope you start a new thread about that and post pictures.   Appears to be lots of folks willing to help with the technical aspects of posting pictures if you need it (I haven't tried it myself, being a relatively new poster)."
474033,JimC,2010-06-09 13:52:00,86," I trolled a red and white one with a dewey for a couple of hours,  no hits,  but maybe should have given it more time in the water during our week on NW Nipissing.    Since Walleye are usually right on the bottom,  I had sufficient weight to get it down there,  but is it possible during the 'shad hatch'  Walleye feed while suspended or even surface-feed at times? My buddy wasn't convinced the Walleye even feed on shads?   I dunno,  do they?  ... if I had caught one,  I guess I could have checked the stomach?"

471908,Gerritt,2010-06-02 16:31:00,6129,Anyone know if the Mayfly Hatch has begun on Nipissing yet? Heading up to the OFC Get Together in a couple weeks.. and was wondering if the fish will be full up on Larvae etc..  I can remember fishing during the hatch with millions of dead Mayflies on the water and the fishing was tough...
471909,BillM,2010-06-02 16:35:00,17367,If that's the case bring a flyrod..  You'll clean up at night time with the whities
471910,Spiel,2010-06-02 16:35:00,9065,"I noticed a few mayfly nymph sheds on the water at Bernies while we were there Gerritt. I'm guessing it'll be in full swing by the Lakair weekend. No worries though, there are ways to get 'em."
471916,Bernie,2010-06-02 16:41:00,3190,Starting to come out. But no great numbers at the South Bay yet.
471918,Gerritt,2010-06-02 16:43:00,6129,"Bernie, will you be making an appearance this year?  Thanks Spiel"
471919,LucG,2010-06-02 16:44:00,779,"I was on the North Bay shore last night before the wind picked up, and there seem to be quite a few.  Is there a difference between the mayfly & shadfly? I allways thought the mayflies came before the shads and were a little smaller?"
471921,Spiel,2010-06-02 16:47:00,9065,"  The ""shadfly"" is a mayfly. Not sure where the shadfly term comes from but I can assure you it is a mayfly, specifically the ""Hexagenia""   http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mayfly"
471925,Guest gbfisher,2010-06-02 16:58:00,0,It's one of the best bites goin. Don't listen to the ones who say different.
471930,Bernie,2010-06-02 17:11:00,3190," Probably not Gerritt, but if the weather is right I may go for the ride to say hello to everyone."
471933,Spiel,2010-06-02 17:20:00,9065,"  That would be terrific Bernie, I hope you can swing it as it would be great to see you!  "
471952,doubleheader,2010-06-02 18:43:00,497,"Just curious, Spiel or anyone else, have you had any success nymphing for walleyes on Nipissing? Just curious, maybe I should pack a flyrod. Last year on thw west arm in early July so many dead mayflies on the water there was a rotting smell. But I think last year was pretty late."
472063,Spiel,2010-06-03 00:32:00,9065,"   On Nipissing, no. I have however caught a few incidental walleye on sub surface nymphs fishing a floating line while targeting whitefish. I'm certain that had I switched to a sinking line to get down closer to the bottom that I may have tagged more walleye.   One of these days (years) I would like to bring the fly rod up to Lakair and try for walleye during the big hatch."
472077,solopaddler,2010-06-03 01:15:00,8605," No, but that's an interesting thought.  When the hatch is on full bore I've had my best luck with brown or brown and orange twister tails tipped with a worm.  The last couple of years a tiny chunk of crawler pulled slowly behind the boat on a slow death hook has been deadly as well.  (Specifically on mud flats where the fish are keying on emerging nymphs)"
472081,Spiel,2010-06-03 01:27:00,9065," If I'm not mistaken Mike the slow death technique was inspired by mayfly feeding walleye.  Even if not, it is a proven method for wallies during the hatch."
472089,solopaddler,2010-06-03 01:47:00,8605," Really? I had no idea, just stumbled onto it.  Definitely works."
472095,sandybay,2010-06-03 02:08:00,64,"This is my theory from observing for a few years. First in South bay area in the shallows where the water warms sooner then the main part of the lake. The shadfly likes to hatch in about 67 degree temps. Hunters bay and Fish bay normally see hatch's around the middle of June about 2 weeks before the main lake hatch in the deeper water, but they seem to be starting now because of the early season. What I have learned is that to be successful with walleye during the shadfly season is to fish the areas of the lake that are not experiencing a hatch. Hope this helps Jeff."
472118,pikeguy,2010-06-03 03:41:00,195,I went out on Nipissing went to fish pike point on the map caught a couple pike but there was some mayfly on the  water floating dead not a carpet like i have seen before but allot
472134,Billy Bob,2010-06-03 12:16:00,5865,"One technique that has worked for me during a hatch is to use a Lindy rig (3-3.5' leader) with a worm (crawler) but you have to blow some air in the worm so it will stay off the bottom....simple but effective.  Bob  Relish these days because before you know it, that white puke will be landing upon us again."
472417,doubleheader,2010-06-04 01:56:00,497,"As I mentioned above, last year we hit the west arm hatch bad. we pulled harnesses and our numbers were way down but we caught some big girls so that lessoned the pain. Good ideas though on the slow death,blown up crawler, and the small grub presentations. I watched a show over the winter where these guys were fishing sink tip line with nymphs and catching quite a few walleyes. I've never tried it. I would think panfish size grubs tipped with maggots might also be productive."
472477,Nipfisher,2010-06-04 12:12:00,2449,"No Shad Flies on the water last night.  I was out on Callander Bay and we managed 7 walleye. All keepers. 4 were small but these 3 were all between 14 and 15 inches. They were all caught on chartruse go-getters and worms. I had the most success when i put a small piece of power bait on my hook before the worm.         We also caught a few sheepshead, rock bass and about 12 dink perch.  Was sure nice to get my Starcraft out on the water. It has been sitting in my driveway taunting me since opening weekend."
472582,tipupesox,2010-06-04 19:06:00,167,Just returned from the West Bay area yesterday.  South Muskrat and the outer portion of German's Bay had a decent hatch going.  We did catch walleyes in both of these areas.  Hope this helps.  Tom.
472592,kickingfrog,2010-06-04 19:58:00,8333,"Was just there from Monday night to Thursday night. South Shore. There were mayflies on the wing, but the peek is not here yet. As someone who grew-up in North Bay and had a family cottage on the south shore at the same time. The hatch was/is much heaver in the city. I always assumed that the large sandy shore that runs most of the length of the city, prevailing winds and the higher concentration of lights had a lot to do with the prevalence of mayflies on in the city.  BTW there was no evidence that the mayflies had any negative impact on my trip... Photos to come."
472624,pikeguy,2010-06-04 21:50:00,195,nice fish!! But i think you cheated some how lol.. I only say that because i did not catch them and you did lol
472633,Sharkbait22,2010-06-04 22:48:00,297,Big mayfly hatches in the south. Trout were unavailable for comment.  http://minnesota.publicradio.org/collections/special/columns/updraft/archive/2010/06/mayfly_hatch_visible_on_dopple.shtml  I wonder if we could see them on radar around North Bay?
472664,Billy Bob,2010-06-05 01:32:00,5865, I concur...........lol
