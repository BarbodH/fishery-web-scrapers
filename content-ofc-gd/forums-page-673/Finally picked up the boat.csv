473909,Banger68,2010-06-09 01:39:00,157," Yeah, been looking there?"
473918,Banger68,2010-06-09 01:51:00,157, I fish for anything that swims (mostly Smallies). Just that the Perch are in 15 mins from home.    They were tasty
473958,moparhawk,2010-06-09 03:34:00,146,That is a beautiful boat! I own a smokercraft so maybe we're cousins? (lol)
474139,brufan,2010-06-09 19:45:00,13,sweet ride man. I hope you have many years of enjoyment out of it. Brufan
474142,Terry,2010-06-09 19:52:00,14456,nice boat
474156,BUSTER,2010-06-09 20:15:00,1336,nice color choice!
474656,Banger68,2010-06-11 01:52:00,157,Thanks guys. Tell you ... it's way more comfy fishing out of this then my canoe.
473151,Banger68,2010-06-07 01:57:00,157,"I finally picked up the new boat Sat.      Waited about a month for a couple things, but it was worth the wait. Boy was I wired for the drive up Sat morning.  Took it it out on Lake Simcoe for a test run. Fun having a boat with a bit of get-up-and-go. Lot more boat then my past ones. Hope to get it out this week for some Perch and see how it fishes."
473154,Nipfisher,2010-06-07 02:04:00,2449,Looks nice. Good luck with the perch.
473156,tizfun,2010-06-07 02:08:00,292,Congrats... Very nice looking boat...  Tiz

473195,irishfield,2010-06-07 03:11:00,26272,VERY nice! Like that high ski rope hook up. Remember nobody stands when pulling someone.. being up there if the rope recoils it will go over everyone's head!

473220,lew,2010-06-07 11:34:00,12766,"I always enjoy  the posts when someone buys a new boat !!  Congrats on the new ride, that's a real beaut and should serve you well for a long time. My bro-in-law has had a Sylvan for many years and has always been very happy with it."
473227,Grimace,2010-06-07 12:29:00,2020,Nice looking rig.  I remember the day I picked up my new boat.  It made the top ten of the best days of my life.
473228,wankerjohn123,2010-06-07 12:41:00,117,Nice ride.
473230,Flappn,2010-06-07 12:43:00,245,Beauty Vessel. Congrats!!
473243,walleyemen,2010-06-07 13:06:00,316,"Nice rig! You'll be greatful you opted for the extra h.p, to many boats are purchased under power, now get out there and get fishing!!!!"
473542,Banger68,2010-06-08 02:48:00,157, It's also so that I can fold up the rear bench while pulling a skier.
473545,Banger68,2010-06-08 02:52:00,157," Yeah, there a several things that are ""family"" oriented on this boat. But I hope to get riggers on it next year."
473546,Dara,2010-06-08 02:54:00,3052,Sweet. I got a new Sylvan last year...they are nice boats
473547,Banger68,2010-06-08 02:55:00,157, I was pretty pumped. Even the guys at the marina commented on how excited I was.  I was a big kid ... what can I say.
473549,Banger68,2010-06-08 02:57:00,157, I definitely wanted to avoid being underpowered. Then they came out with the 125 Optimax based on the same block just after I ordered it.  Planning to do a little Perch fishing tomorrow.
473551,ohhenrygsr,2010-06-08 03:00:00,947, LOL it is funny seeing the reaction when they first receive there brand new boat.  Kinda makes me jealous and feel like a kid in a Candy store kinda look.  Congrats
473552,NANUK,2010-06-08 03:02:00,797,Very nice!!! Congrats and many many years of safe boating.
473554,Banger68,2010-06-08 03:06:00,157," Yeah, I'm pretty sure I was wearing that goofy grin all day."
