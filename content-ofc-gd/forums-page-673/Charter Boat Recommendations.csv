472146,torco,2010-06-03 13:04:00,656,"Hi,  I just opened my email this morning and apparently the charter boat operator I booked with for August(the day before my bro's wedding) has doubled booked my morning. He is hoping I can reschedule for the afternoon but my brother also has his rehearsal that day. I'm a little pissed off as can be expected because this was suppose to be a boys trip with me, my brother, dad, uncle and cousins most of who are from Northern Ontario and can't reschedule any earlier as they are already taking time off to come down for the wedding.  So I am hoping my fellow OFC'ers can give me some suggestions on charter's I can call as I feel like with it being June its already late in the game to be trying find one.  Thanks, Mark"
472148,Headhunter,2010-06-03 13:08:00,5703,"Well, we have a number of charter captains here, but I think we need to know where you are hoping to leave from, west end of the lake, central basin etc... Or, you could PM Fishhunter! HH"
472162,torco,2010-06-03 13:52:00,656,"Good point. I am out guelph way, so would prefer to leave from port credit to bronte area. That said would be willing to go as far east as durham region."
472174,bigbuck,2010-06-03 14:10:00,2449,Try Eddie with Square Tail charters out of Port Credit. He's a good guy and will get you on some fish. 416-527-5318. I'd have said Fishunter but he's in Port Hope and that would be a long trek from Guelph especially since he has his wedding rehearsal that day and it would not be good to start off the marriage by being late for the rehearsal.
472197,tonyb,2010-06-03 14:57:00,1637,"Dave Sullivan of Hot Reels fishing team.  He recently took ownership of a beautiful 31 Tiara Open, rigged to the hilt and is one of the most consistent salmon tournament winners on the lake.  http://www.hotreelsf...m/charters.html  Also, the other recommendations previously mentioned in this thread are reputable.  One thing to consider is finding an charter operator who is registered in the Great Ontario Salmon Derby that will be running in August.  Charter operations that are registered with the derby, will include a one-day ticket for the derby, ensuring that any monster you catch will be eligible for entry into the derby.  In my opinion, it would be foolish to NOT have tickets for the derby when you are fishing on the lake.  How many times have you heard of someone catching a derby winning fish, but they didn't have a ticket!?  More info on the derby at http://www.greatontariosalmonderby.ca/ and also a list of registered charter boats so far http://www.greatonta...derby.ca/boats/  Good luck! Tony"
