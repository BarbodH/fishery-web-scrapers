473328,Bernie,2010-06-07 18:02:00,3190,Glad to see you caught some fish KF.  A friend stopped by today and reported catching a lot of pickerel in the Callander Bay area. He was pretty excited about it.  Still pretty quiet catching at the South Bay area.
473331,MJL,2010-06-07 18:10:00,2427,Great report KF...Must be totally awesome to get to fish with your brother.  Do you fish together often?  Love the markings on that pike. Thanks for sharing
473334,doubleheader,2010-06-07 18:13:00,497,great report
473356,curlrap,2010-06-07 20:06:00,58,"Nice catch, have you ever thought about guiding. You would make millions i'm sure!! Not too many people can show off a catch like that on nipissing."
473411,walleyemaster,2010-06-07 22:54:00,325,excelent repot guys and awsome walleye..nothin better than catching walleye
473622,TJQ,2010-06-08 12:28:00,7806,Im glad you guys did well!!
473626,mr blizzard,2010-06-08 12:44:00,1589,Great pics and information as usual. Glad to see you had some great family time together.   Congratulations and thanks for the computer help.
474086,kickingfrog,2010-06-09 16:52:00,8333,"My uncle will still use one sometimes, 30 plus years ago it was all we used. Shiners early in the year and worms in mid june. That was the extent of our repertoire and if we didn't catch fish it was someone else's fault. Now a crawler harness is the go-to option if I'm searching for fish on flats.  Trout ""opener"" and this trip in early June is about the extent of regular trips right now. We try to do some fall steelhead and maybe trip or two on the ice.  Ha, Ha. Guiding is hard work, and I love fishing for myself too much to try to make a living at it."
474206,Guest Johnny Bass,2010-06-09 22:57:00,0,My friend was watching the weather network and they were talking about how the water levels were low and the fishermen were complaining about the lack of fish in Nipissing this year.
474230,kickingfrog,2010-06-10 00:07:00,8333,Here are some photos from my brother's camera. Most/ all are fish that were already posted but there are a few different angles.                  
474249,Nipfisher,2010-06-10 00:46:00,2449,Ahhhh after seeing the last picture now I know it's not the crank baits it the GULP spray!. That awesome sunset pic shows how beautiful Nipissing is.
473017,kickingfrog,2010-06-06 15:26:00,8333,"My brother and I were up to our uncle's place from Monday night until Thursday afternoon. We hit our usual areas and found some new spots on spots this time. Only ended up with 8 fish under the slot.  Here are most of the rest:                                              My brother has a bunch on his camera as well. If I get 'em, I'll post a few more.  Most of those fish were caught in the middle of the day trolling and casting crank baits (that was a golden 3 hours).  All were released including the 2 or 3 that were just out the other side of the slot."
473020,sandmann,2010-06-06 15:39:00,51,Congrats on a successful walleye hunt
473022,wankerjohn123,2010-06-06 15:47:00,117,NICE!!!!  Thanks for sharing.
473052,b2kptbo,2010-06-06 17:17:00,1505,"Thats some good fishin Rob, thanks for the report..."
473057,Joey,2010-06-06 17:30:00,9122,Awesome report and pics!  Can't wait to get up there myself soon.  Joey
473060,irishfield,2010-06-06 18:07:00,26272,Some GREAT shots (and fishing) there Rob !!! I see your brother even caught a Terry Fish...
473062,Roy,2010-06-06 18:21:00,13728,"Thanks for that report, Rob. It must be so good to have time with your brother fishing...even sweeter when the bite is on."
473065,Rich Clemens,2010-06-06 18:34:00,3131,Great times Rob.
473089,Grimace,2010-06-06 20:33:00,2020,Nicely done. Great photos as well.
473106,Guest Johnny Bass,2010-06-06 23:15:00,0,WOW! You guys really cleaned house.
473109,JimC,2010-06-06 23:24:00,86,"man, those are some Great pictures !!   My buddies and I were fishing last week in North West Arm and did terrible in the Walleye dept.    Used half worms on spinners,  trolling most of the time.   Lots of 'shads' in the water there.  If I may ask,  what part of Nipissing (in general) were you in?"
473110,walleyemen,2010-06-06 23:24:00,316,"Nice job Rob glad to see you had a great time, and no one feel out of a boat LOL! WAyne"
473119,cpguy29,2010-06-06 23:58:00,148,Nice! You guys really nailed em!
473121,Black_Blade,2010-06-07 00:02:00,258,Awesome fishing!  I'm hoping to get in on some of that action soon as well!
473123,Handlebarz,2010-06-07 00:05:00,3790,Dang that's some good shootin congrats guys heck I have not caught a thing on my Polish perch WTH.
473189,Nipfisher,2010-06-07 02:53:00,2449,I find these posts so interesting. I have fished Nipissing 1000s of times and I have a box full of crankbaits yet I have never trolled for walleye with crankbaits on Nipissing before. Live bait is so successful I always start with it. There were some nice big ones you caut and kudos to you for releasing the ones outside the slot.
473193,corvette1,2010-06-07 03:07:00,1765,awesome trip congrats nice eyes and pike
473198,scuro2,2010-06-07 03:18:00,904,Nice report and I thought the news was that walleye were fished out.
473199,wankerjohn123,2010-06-07 03:25:00,117,13 more days and I'll be there......
473251,Headhunter,2010-06-07 13:55:00,5703,"Good shooting Lads! Did I spot the ""Polish Perch"" hangin out of one of those Pickereye's mouth? Nice to see that someone can catch a fish on that thing! HH"
473277,JimC,2010-06-07 15:06:00,86," again,  Congrats on your fine catch and thanks for sharing the pictures.   Rob,  I am rather new here so not sure if I should expect a response when I ask a question (per my earlier post)?  My buddies and I come up for one week every year, so we are done on Nipissing till 2011.  We go to the same area,  and fish the same way.  ie. spinners and worms,  trolling,  and weighted to stay on the bottom.   I am guessing you were catching those Walleye's in a different part of the Lake than we were?   Calender Bay?   I am not interested if finding out where your 'honey holes' are,  but would appreciate knowing the general area.   I am also interested to know what depth you were fishing in, as we were stuck in pretty consistent 7-8 ft of water, where normally it is around 10ft.  Maybe the NW area is being over fished commercially?    We saw nets strung in one of our fav spots for the first time.   Not sure if this is First Nations nets or if there is other commercial fishing allowed on the Lake?  thanks"
473297,kickingfrog,2010-06-07 16:42:00,8333,"My uncle's place is about half way between Calander bay and hunter's bay, and we didn't go far to find the fish.  My brother caught that pike, 3 walleye and a smallie on that thing.  We usually don't troll either because my uncle's boat is not suitable, but this year with the low water we had to use my cousin's 14ft aluminum. The one day we fished one spot in the morning jigging and drifting like the other boats. We got a few nice ones. When the other boats left for lunch we decided to troll the spot a bit. We caught 10 fish between 20 and 25 inches in two hours. We went back the next day and picked off 3 more casting.  They are shhhhhh!   See above. The pike cracked the top of the lure though."
473298,kickingfrog,2010-06-07 16:47:00,8333, We were in the same areas we usually fish and ya the water is 2 and a half feet shallower than most years. The areas we fish there is a fast transition from one depth to another (shoals and points) so it did not appear to make a difference to the fish if there was 12ft of water over their heads or 10ft. The structure was the key.
473304,JimC,2010-06-07 17:07:00,86,"Thanks for the feedback, Rob.  I have a few similar looking lures in my box,  and almost put one on in desperation to drag around for awhile when nothing was hitting our spinner / worm combo.   Wish I had at least tried it.  I will for sure next year.  Does anyone use those Red and White June Bugs (by Lucky Strike, I think) any more?   When I was a kid in North Bay,  my Dad and Uncles fished the Goose Islands,  and limited each time out.   That's all they used,  tipped with a shiner or sometimes a fat dew worm.   Of course, there were way more pickerel back then (45-50 years ago) than there are now,  so probably most anything would get clobbered?   just curious."
473305,smally21,2010-06-07 17:08:00,993,"we fished the west arm the weekend before - jigging worms, trolling harnesses, casting crankbaits til our arms fell off.  scored a few eyes butmostly pike.  the whole area is 5-7 feet deep and endless searching yields almost no structure, just a big flat bowl.  travelled out a couple of times past the hardwoods and found some deeper water but very difficult to find shoals or dropoffs.  nice scenery, had a great shore lunch.  id probably fish nipissing again from a different area, although with normal water depths the endless bays and islands look great for bass.  nice post, great pics."
