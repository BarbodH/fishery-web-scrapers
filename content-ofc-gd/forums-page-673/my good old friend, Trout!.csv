Some caught on the fly with little drys and others with little spinners.  Heres a few, alot i didnt take a picture due to help catch and release.    "

474215,BillsTheBassMan,2010-06-09 23:27:00,932,"Very Very Nice.  I, also, love the elusive brown.  I've really had a good season and am sad to see the best days of the season behind us.  Hopefully from here until July I can get into some bigger fellas before I write it off until September.  Ryan"
