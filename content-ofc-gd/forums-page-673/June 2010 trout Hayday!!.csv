474712,fish_finder,2010-06-11 03:27:00,370," Yes, I got quite a few specks.  The size on the specks were smaller than previous years.  Usually I manage a couple over 14 or 15 inches this particular week, but the speck size was smaller this year.  I wish more people would practice C&R in these parts.  The population is dropping quickly (sizable spawning fish that is)  It used to be several in the 14 to 15 inch range, but not these days."
474560,fish_finder,2010-06-10 21:37:00,370,"I finally had a few minutes since getting back to sort through some of the pictures I had from last week.  It was an excellent week, even though it rained just about every day.  Luckily, while all of the rivers in the area were blown big time, the river we always fish was high, but clear.  There was a bit of a stain to the water, but just enough to turn on some of the bigger fish out there.  A small branch of the river:    Lots of hatches were going on, and I did hit a couple of good spinnerfalls earlier in the week before it cooled off too much.  The main bugs out and about were these dudes:                 And then there were the feesh!  There were lots of them!                                    Didn't manage to hit the green drake hatch this season, but we'll see what the next couple of weeks brings.  Probably the best moment I had out there came on the tuesday evening.  I had been out for a few hours late afternoon and caught a few decent fish.  I had just about hiked back to camp when a boil in the river caught my eye, so I stopped and watched for a few minutes.  About 5 minutes later or so, another boil in the same spot.  This time I saw what he was eating.    He was grabbing big stoneflys as they were bouncing and skittering on the surface dislodging their eggsacs.  They're well over an inch long to give some perspective to their size.  And their double wings make them look even bigger in flight.  Anyways, I watched for a while longer and figured he'd be there when I came back later.  So I headed back to camp, had a couple of beers and probably a scotch or two while I tied up some of these.    I walked back to that same spot....which was only about a 200 foot walk from the site and watched again.  Sure enough, he rose again.  I cast about 25 or 30 feet to him, twitch the stimulator carefully as it comes right down his feeding lane and BOOM!  There were a number of very interesting words spoken to myself as I chased the bugger downstream.  He had me into my backing in about 10 seconds.  After a long battle, you wouldn't believe what happened!!   I Landed him!  Definitely my biggest resident brown to date on the fly!  (I can't really count the fish in the grand as accomplishments)    I don't like having fish out of the water, but I wanted a shot of this dude!        It was a great week that ended with the Midwestern Ontario Sportsmans Show in walkerton."
474564,jonc,2010-06-10 21:51:00,7,Great report dude! Absolute gorgeous fish you got yourself there!! Well done!
474565,fish-miester,2010-06-10 21:53:00,864,well.. Im jealous !
474566,Roy,2010-06-10 21:54:00,13728,Congrats to you! What a great report and pics! Thank you.
474567,fish_finder,2010-06-10 21:56:00,370,"Thanks guys.  Its definitely that time of year when the trout in streams are very active with all the bug activity.  It actually got really tough later in the week to not set the hook on some of the ""smaller"" fish."
474570,frozen-fire,2010-06-10 22:04:00,542,That is a stunning resident brown! I've been looking for one of those myself!
474580,Musky or Specks,2010-06-10 22:33:00,2710,!!   I Landed him!  Definitely my biggest resident brown to date on the fly!  (I can't really count the fish in the grand as accomplishments)    Good for you over hyped fish farm
474586,timmeh,2010-06-10 22:38:00,609,Very nice
474590,MJL,2010-06-10 22:45:00,2427,Gorgeous fish all around.  Well done!  Fantastic bug shots too...Saving them to my hard drive in the hopes that they will come in handy in the near future
474592,solopaddler,2010-06-10 22:50:00,8605,"It takes a lot to truly impress me, and man you did it.  That is beyond outstanding, Gierach-esque in fact.  "
474594,Bill Shearer,2010-06-10 23:04:00,456,"Mike.... Not exactly sure who that was you were referring to, but if you think it's a positive, then I do too! At any rate, great post, that surely makes me envious of his abilities. Far beyond mine,......"
474595,wallacio,2010-06-10 23:08:00,475,"Thanks for sharing your accomplishment with us!   That's an amazing fish and even more impressive that it was taken on a dry!   Did you happen to get a measurement on him?  I'm guessing 21"" or so?"
474597,wallacio,2010-06-10 23:12:00,475, A great author esp. if you like Fly Fishing.  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Gierach  I can't believe that there are Iso's out already...all of this year's hatches are 2-4 weeks ahead of schedule!
474600,Duckie,2010-06-10 23:31:00,305,amazing shots. looks like you had an awesome day!
474604,FlyGuy5,2010-06-10 23:38:00,101,"Well done great looking fish, that just inspired me to tie some flies and gonna hit the water tomorrow."
474663,rock34,2010-06-11 02:07:00,215,"Sickness! Thanks for sharing. I just got back from the river having lost an 18"" + brown......i really needed this little pick me up  Seriously though, that looks like a hell of a week!"
474678,laszlo,2010-06-11 02:28:00,487,O.K.  Now I have no choice but to finally get my first fly set up. Very inspiring!  Wicked report.
474679,Nemo,2010-06-11 02:30:00,727,A couple of them were specks??? Yes or no?
474681,craigdritchie,2010-06-11 02:34:00,1586,"Gorgeous fishies, and lovely photos. Nice."
474684,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2010-06-11 02:40:00,0,Killer stream report bud.  Well done! 
474686,alexcba,2010-06-11 02:41:00,634, specks and rainbow.
474704,fish_finder,2010-06-11 03:15:00,370, The only way dude!!
474705,fish_finder,2010-06-11 03:17:00,370," Well....you know EXACTLY what I'm saying.  That sewer is in my front yard, and I fish it about 3 times a year.  Honestly, those 12 inch fish fight like the 22s out of the sewer!!"
474707,fish_finder,2010-06-11 03:21:00,370, 20 1/4 to be exact.  I had to measure him as its pretty hard to find natural fish that large.  My wife says she heard me moaning as it dragged me downstream...I think she was jealous....
474710,fish_finder,2010-06-11 03:24:00,370," Buddy.......do it.  I hear so many people say how ""elusive""  ""elitist"" whatever....  It aint that hard at all.  Of course, I started when I was about 5, but even still,  if you can fish, you can fish on the fly."
