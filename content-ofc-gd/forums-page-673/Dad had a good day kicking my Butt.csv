474211,Guest Johnny Bass,2010-06-09 23:06:00,0, Very nice. Those swim baits can really catch fish! Nothing like father and son spending quality time together. Good for you.
474212,Handlebarz,2010-06-09 23:14:00,3790,next to kids fishing pics I love to see father and son days as many know here time is short great to see you let him kick you butt for the day LOL.  I have not used the bass magnets but do really like there water wolf musky sized lures not to mention that they are great people I always look forward to seeing them at the shows.
