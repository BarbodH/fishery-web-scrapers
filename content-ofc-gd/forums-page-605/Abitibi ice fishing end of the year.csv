We'll do some skiing in QC and would love to try for some walleye on the Abitibi ice. Was counting on a guy to take me out but he needs to travel and will not be available at those dates. Does anyone know of good fishing guide I can talk to and see if we can work something out.  Cheers, Ice Fisherman"
526054,solopaddler,2010-12-07 02:55:00,8605,Emil I read your post and realized I never did get back to you.  Very sorry.  This is the only outfitter I'm aware of  http://icefishbigab.com/
526063,icefisherman,2010-12-07 03:10:00,952,"No problem Mike. My understanding is (read it somewhere)those guys have been out of business for a while...looks at the last update on their web site is from 2007.  Hope someone knows of a good guide in the area... I read how Abitibi is the hot spot for fishing eyes on the ice so there has to be people familiar with the area who do well there. Not much time left but hope I can get ahold of someone like that  Cheers, Ice Fisherman"
526098,bare foot wader,2010-12-07 08:37:00,1354,"confirmed he's out of business...we stayed with him for a few years...there was another operation, think more of a sled/adventure operation or somethign like that offered ice fishing on the side...but haven't heard anything about them for a few  years as well  i think your best bet would to get a hold of a local to take you out, or some research for access points and wing it...not sure when it froze over but probably late nov, so a power auger would be clutch to have"
526135,icefisherman,2010-12-07 13:53:00,952,"Got the power auger and pretty much everything else but the snowmobile....I understand I can rent one from these guys:  http://www.rentsnowmobile.com/rentals.htm  But was warned not to attempt Abitibi by myself and without someone local who knows the area/ice well....so the search for a local guide is still ON  Cheers, Ice Fisherman"
