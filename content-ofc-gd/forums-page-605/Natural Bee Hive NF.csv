I have never seen anything like it before, and thought it was worth a post. Some of the steelhead guys do a lot of river walking through the bush and might come across them from time to time. The bees were inside it moving verrrrrry slow.

525899,Rod Caster,2010-12-06 17:27:00,5784,I've only seen wasp nests...never anything like this. Usually they build them in holes in trees don't they? This one is right out in the open. Very cool how you can clearly see the wax. Did you collect any honey for your toast???
525998,stubbex1,2010-12-06 22:57:00,164,"Nope, not a big fan of honey...plus i'm not too sure i could outrun a couple hundred bees, even though they might be a slow haha"
526030,Joey,2010-12-07 01:00:00,9122,That is freaky looking.  Very interesting compared to other ones I've seen!!
526094,Dozer,2010-12-07 05:43:00,896,Something to do with an Atlantic?
526107,Marc Thorpe,2010-12-07 11:36:00,621,"Very interesting,I did quite allot of bee keeping when I was younger with my dad ,up to 50 hives. I suspect this maybe a domesticated swarm that established itself in this manner during later summer. Generally wild bees build nests/hives in hollow trees and laid down tree tree trunks or non exposed areas although they can if swarming occurs in the late season create such a nest but not a common occurrence,given the size,I suspect a domesticated swarm Chances are it will freeze over winter due to lack of weather protection  very cool picture and find"
526133,johnnyb,2010-12-07 13:46:00,3413,"Saw one big hive like that stuck to the side of a tree once....got to close as I was admiring it, and a couple ""warning bees"" just zipped right out and pelted me....didn't seem like they were trying to sting....just back me up a bit.  Came at me like they were shot out of a gun and literally bounced off of me.  I heeded the warning and backed up, and that was good enough for them. The one you saw is pretty cool though, in the branches like that.  Nice find!"
