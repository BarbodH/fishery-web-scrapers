524843,irishfield,2010-12-03 01:54:00,26272,LLoyd swears by ColdFX.. keeps him on the high seas chartering
524845,Dutchy,2010-12-03 02:02:00,416,Contact C. Best stuff ever  :thumbsup_anim:
524849,Fisherman,2010-12-03 02:05:00,7201, Quit watching the Leafs loose again..that should ease most of the pain.
524851,Grimace,2010-12-03 02:07:00,2020,Cold fx.  Works wonders.
524852,vinnimon,2010-12-03 02:09:00,2593,Good old fashioned chicken soup!Pluck it and boil! The others that has been mentioned works as well!
524853,walleyejack,2010-12-03 02:10:00,358,Cold FX all the way !!!
524856,walleyejack,2010-12-03 02:15:00,358," Not sure how they call themselves a hockey team, Oilers played 3 games in four nights and they still out hustle them and beat them to the puck, heads will roll this week,hopefully Wilsons,I think they laid down on him cause of public tactics,calling indiviuals out in the media,that is for his office or the dressing room at the most. They get a new coach and they will shine,lots of fast young talent on the team,but, they do have a good farm team for Boston and other teams."
524857,mercman,2010-12-03 02:17:00,7054,"buckleys warmed for 10sec in the m/w.tastes like scat, but it works."
524858,irishfield,2010-12-03 02:19:00,26272,Hot Rum toddies... It'll help the cold and more importantly your won't notice how bad the leafs are !!
524864,Beans,2010-12-03 02:41:00,3339, Yep...Hot rum toddies...won't cure your cold but...drink enough of them and you won't care if you got a cold...  Cold FX is good if you start taking it early in the fall to build up your immune system...does nada if you already got a cold...   
524875,cram,2010-12-03 03:51:00,1733,Eat lots of garlic or onions -- stimulates the immune system. Gargle listerine or salt water to kill stuff in your throat. Drink warm fluids. Get sleep.
524882,tb4me,2010-12-03 04:13:00,3295,Thanks guys! I never get sick so of course when I do im a big baby...lol Ya leafs are a shame. Long time fan. The nice thing about a young team is they have lots to work with..Remain Positive leafers!
524936,bigbuck,2010-12-03 14:12:00,2449,"Eat lots of garlic and chicken soup (laced with some cayenne pepper to keep the mucous flowing), gargle with warm salt water, hot tea with honey and like Bing Crosby used to say 'Have a hot toddie for your body' Oh yeah, try to get as much sleep as possible."
524949,Fish Farmer,2010-12-03 14:49:00,2234,"If all of the above doesn't work, just go fishin, catching something takes your mind off your cold. What's in that Cold FX, my kids tell me I should take it because I'm always getting colds this time of year. Could be the cold beer"
525298,Beans,2010-12-04 17:45:00,3339,"This thread reminds me of back in my drinking days...my first wife was always on me about drinking too much...  ""wadda ya mean, I'm drinking too much...It's not me that keeps getting colds all the time"""
525309,misfish,2010-12-04 18:46:00,29133,I got one coming on now.  Be going out for some PHO and HOT sauce.Always works.
525376,Gerritt,2010-12-04 23:28:00,6129,Mmmmmmm pho! love it... that right there sealed the deal for supper...  heading over to the local Vietnamese restaurant!  Mmmmmm...  G
