When I first moved to the neighbourhood the green space was loaded with birds, which are not gone for some reason.  When you walk the trail, you pass a small pond. Well, when I first got there I heard a loud splash and passed it off as a muskrat and kept going. Well on the way back to my car I noticed what had made the splash.    Sorry for some reason I couldn't post the pic. Anyway, a pair of minks had taken up residence at this pond. They were fun to watch but I suddenly realised that my lens was not very compatible with my new camera so I just had to got get an new one....so tomorrow I'll hopefully have better pics of the pair  Cheers,   Dave"

525706,OhioFisherman,2010-12-06 01:33:00,6623,I actually had a pair of them wander through my back yard earlier this year. It was the first time I had ever seen any here in Ohio. They are cool to watch.
525751,Rod Caster,2010-12-06 02:49:00,5784,I've seen a few of them in the rocks on Simcoe's shores. Cute animals
525771,JohnF,2010-12-06 08:48:00,3494, Mink are vicious and stinky. The town where I grew up was big into mink and fox ranching. As kids we made a bit of cash live trapping escaped mink and selling them to the ranchers. We used those old heavy gauge plastic fertilizer bags to hold them when we took them out of the box traps. The mink were not in the least cooperative. If you spend any time wading the Thames near St.Marys you'll see lots of wild mink today. They're interesting to watch. They're pretty animals that don't show the attitude till you mess with them.  JF
525806,Rod Caster,2010-12-06 13:41:00,5784," Interesting...I guess most of these ""ferret"" type animals (Fisher, weasel, mink) are nasty and good predators. ..And I thought cats were bad."
525825,fishing n autograph,2010-12-06 14:20:00,2540,aparantly they have taken over Toronto Island too
