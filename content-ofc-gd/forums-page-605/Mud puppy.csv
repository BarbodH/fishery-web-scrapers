525095,Rod Caster,2010-12-03 21:51:00,5784,I'm hoping to catch lots of these this winter  We caught it in around 25 fow.  
525097,misfish,2010-12-03 22:02:00,29133,AHHHHHHHHH aint he cute. Looks alittle cold.
525100,bare foot wader,2010-12-03 22:18:00,1354,"I think they're pretty cool, caught my fair share of them...slightly annoying at times..lol  would make a sweet pet"
525102,Guest gbfisher,2010-12-03 22:23:00,0,Mudpuupy races are the best. Each player catches one. Put them all in a bucket. Spin it around once. Dump the bucket gingerly and the first one to make it back to the hole WINS.... I can garantee each one will go straight back to the nearest hole...I don't know how they know where the hole is but they do.
525112,misfish,2010-12-03 22:57:00,29133," They feel the force,just like Luke Skywalker.  Great pic,I put it on my desk top."
525113,tb4me,2010-12-03 22:59:00,3295,what are they anywy? I caught one on calendar bay and on erie. Each time I was Ice fishin.They squeal when you unhook em. I think thier gross

525123,Gerritt,2010-12-03 23:28:00,6129,"They are a type of Salamander, and are Native to Ontario fresh water lakes.  Here is a link to more info.. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mudpuppy"

525167,limeyangler,2010-12-04 01:47:00,5204,Thats freekin' awesome...what a cool looking beastie!
525186,love2fishhave2work,2010-12-04 02:42:00,212,"Never forget catching one as a kid in the Detroit river.  While trying the get the hook out, the thing bit my finger and latched on with a death grip.  Needed to pry it off.  Scared the @%@$% out of me."
525230,Rod Caster,2010-12-04 04:31:00,5784," Ling are nearly as bad....minus the legs.  Newboykool: Mud puppies will eat anything off bottom. The secret is to fish often  Other than that, it's just been luck for me.  Merc: I'm quite sure they are native to the lakes up here.... we don't hate 'em like we hate gobies.  GB: Mudpuppyracing is my new favorite sport. Thanks for idea."
525270,sauce,2010-12-04 14:06:00,219,"Keep in mind they are a protected species. So anyone thinking of eating one... think again. Catch n release, although racing them could liven up a slow day."
525275,perchslayer666,2010-12-04 14:43:00,280,"Kill them with fire. I hate these things, super gross, and stink. I wonder if fish eat these things???"
525277,tknohpy,2010-12-04 14:48:00,162,If you fish nippissing leave your bait on the bottom at night and you will get one
525282,JohnF,2010-12-04 15:25:00,3494,"We used to come across them when we were playing on the river as kids. They made me squirm. They looked too lizardy and yes, they would bite. I'm ashamed to admit that we often crushed them with big rocks.  JF"
525285,mbac31,2010-12-04 16:05:00,904,When I first moved here from Newfoundland I was Ice Fishing up north. I started dozing off in the portable hut looking at the hole and woke up to one of these little freaks looking at me. Scared the Jeebers out of me for sure. Someone must have caught it and released it and it decided it wanted something in my hut. I never saw something like that and thought  it was a mutant of some sort. Kinda scared me at first but realized it wasnt harmfull other than the fact that the little buggers do bite.
525347,Rod Caster,2010-12-04 21:22:00,5784, Sounds like they need to be protected from all the scaredey- cat fishermen here. hehehe.
