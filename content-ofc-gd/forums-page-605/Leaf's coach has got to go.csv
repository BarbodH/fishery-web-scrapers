525449,lookinforwalleye,2010-12-05 03:45:00,4399,  What attack was that?
525452,Guest Johnny Bass,2010-12-05 03:56:00,0," True enough!First game back and He came to play! With him on the team we are 6-1-2!!!  I'm proud of the leafs. We beat a really tough goaltender! All the sceptics that were laughing when I said we were a center away from a good team, and a another guy away from a great team. A simple guy like Armstrong back in the line up, made a significant impact. Guigere played well. We're no Stanley cup team but we we have potential."
525462,Grimace,2010-12-05 04:18:00,2020,"  He is confusing him with that other guy.  I forget his name.  Bad stick swinging incident.  Ahl suspended him for a good while.  Was not Plekanec, the name started with a P though, but a russian.  Tip of my tongue.  Damn."
525464,Grimace,2010-12-05 04:21:00,2020,Alexander Perezhogin.   Thats it.
525468,tb4me,2010-12-05 04:30:00,3295,Wow I just looked up on youtube. Thats just gross.Did he end up getting charged?

525482,lookinforwalleye,2010-12-05 05:53:00,4399,"  Ya I knew it was  Perezhogin he thinking about,he`s often confused."
525484,lookinforwalleye,2010-12-05 06:08:00,4399," While I do not condone what Perezhogin did the facts include Stafford cross checking Perezhogin in the face and taking a wild two handed swing at Perezhogins head, Stafford was suspended as well."
521560,misfish,2010-11-19 20:44:00,29133,"Phaneuf has not impressed me since he came over IMO. As for Kaberle,I thought when he was good,he was a Salming,but his game has taken a few steps back. He,s not a tough guy defenceman. On defence,you need toughness.IMO Clear the screener and get the puck out past the blue line."
521890,lookinforwalleye,2010-11-21 03:01:00,4399,"  As predicted a good game,the Monster was great as was Price.  Did poor Komi think he was back playing for the Habs?"
521891,irishfield,2010-11-21 03:02:00,26272,I was a real nice pass... lol
521894,Guest Johnny Bass,2010-11-21 03:28:00,0," Good game for sure. The better team won. Montreal played a great defensive game(I really like Jacques Martin's coaching style and wanted him to coach the leafs). The monster played great and it was not his fault on either goal. First goal was a fluke and second goal was a giveaway by our own player.....  Price only made two good saves in my opinion, and was saved by Spacek with 3 minutes left in the game. His defense makes him look good and gives him all kinds of confidence.  With that said....The monster made the better saves because Montreal had the better scoring chances.  The refs let them play it out, with the habs having more shots shorthanded then us on the power play.....  The habs killed us on the faceoffs. I think Zigomanis was a good face off guy, wasn't he? I liked him. But he drew crappy penalties.  The biggest problem was the leafs were fanning on the puck and giveaway the puck constantly. This has been happening for a while.  Oh well. Congrats to the Montreal fans for a win well deserved. I noticed right from the start, their fans are more pumped then the leaf fans."
521896,SBCregal,2010-11-21 03:36:00,688,"the fans there are more pumped up than the ""fans"" at acc for sure.  the ""fans"" at the acc cant cheer too loudly or they'll spill their champagne and caviar."

522427,Guest Johnny Bass,2010-11-23 02:48:00,0,"Great game!!! Leafs dominated!Jonas Gustavsson played great. I've been saying this from the beginning of the season. He's the better goalie. The Kulimen line is still the best line. Like I said before. Not too many Russians that cant find the back of the net.  Our checking line has to forecheck more agressivly. They caused a few turn overs today doing so. Give the fans something to cheer about!  This thing about defensemen shooting wide to get rebounds is not working. Put it on net and anything can happen. Especially with traffic in front.  Now I know what they mean by Kessel being one dimensional. He has to try something new. He comes in and shoots. If he is going to do that? At least get closer to the net!He has a good shot. He is shooting from the top of the circle!! Kadri played well, but he has to bulk up. Against the boards he's weak.  That's Johnny Bass's hockey talk for tonight."
522437,Guest Johnny Bass,2010-11-23 03:03:00,0,"Montreal lost and Ottawa is winning 3-2 but LA scored the tie breaker with 3 seconds!!It is going to review, but it looks like a goal!!!!  Dang!They didn't count it! LA got robbed two goals!!!"
525002,Pikeslayer,2010-12-03 17:30:00,1443,"For the record (per my original post), I 'm sticking with my prediction that Wilson is gone on Sunday Dec 5th.  Pikeslayer  BTW, Whoever's in first, that's my team!!"
525041,Guest Johnny Bass,2010-12-03 19:19:00,0,What I dont get is Kaberle has been the worst player on the ice for the longest time and Wilson is giving him more ice time.  I guess he is trying to spark our offense but watching Kaberle play is annoying. On that first goal he should have wallpaper Eberle to the boards! We had many good chances and we even hit a post. But their goalie outplayed ours.....  I hope the boos wake up Kessel in Boston and he scores a hatrick!!
525077,misfish,2010-12-03 20:40:00,29133,"It would seem we the fans know nothing about coaching and what a bad coached team looks like to us,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,   Ron Wilson won't be fired.  Leafs GM Brian Burke backed his coach — yet again — despite boos raining down from the Air Canada Centre during a 5-0 loss to Edmonton and fans chanting “Fire Wilson.”  “No coaching change,” Burke told TSN, which repeated the comment on Twitter.  The whole Twitter universe seemed to be talking about Wilson — the topic was trending in Canada — with fans weighing in on their opinion.  “If it was ANY other team in the NHL, the coach would be gone. Because his name is Ron Wilson, he stays,” tweeted @andrewrizzi.  “So if it isn't Ron Wilson's fault, then it's Brian Burkes. No ifs, ands, or buts about it,” said @BrianHuddle.  Wilson had his defenders.  “We're not big Ron Wilson fans. Still, how can fans say #Leafs have no talent, then say fire Wilson. If he's given no talent, he can't win,” tweeted @theSportsJesters.  Twitter only echoed Toronto’s angry fans wallowing in hopelessness.  Up next, the Boston Bruins are here Saturday with Tyler Seguin — the No. 2 overall pick the Leafs could have had last season if not for the Kessel deal. The booing was vociferous against the Oilers but imagine the soundtrack to Saturday’s game if the Bruins win and Seguin pops a goal or two.  After that, the Leafs face Sidney Crosby and Alexander Ovechkin in consecutive games on a road trip through Pittsburgh and Washington. Then they’re home to face Philadelphia and Montreal."
525084,jediangler,2010-12-03 21:06:00,1923,"Saturday's game is in Toronto, Johnny, so any boos Ke$$el hears will be coming from the Leaf fans."

525296,Guest Johnny Bass,2010-12-04 17:31:00,0,"Latest news? According to Beauchemin? It isn't the coaches fault. They are told what to do and they dont do it. This coming from the only solid stay at home defensemen we have.  Can you blame injuries? Before the injuries, we were 5-2-1. Apparently in regards to giving away draft picks? In Burke's defense? He said he never expected to finish so low in the standings. He figured he was giving Boston a 10th rounder at best. And this year, he certainly did not expect for the leafs to do this poorly......  Apparently His starting line will consist of Kessel at center, with Versteeg(He has earned it), and Armstrong. Maybe he can alternate Kadri in there if Armstrong is still a bit rusty and plays poorly. He is also bringing up Rosehill. I hope they wallpaper whoever it is playing along side of Chara! Cause some turnovers and draw some retaliation penalties.  Maybe we should boo Seguin. But the leafs have more class then that. He is a Torontonian and it will be a special game for him. Hopefully not too special.LOL"
525299,jediangler,2010-12-04 17:48:00,1923,I'm so looking forward to seeing Ke$$el at center. He is afraid of contact and doesn't play defence. Kadri is on the 4th line with Orr and either Mitchell or Rosehill. Watch how long it takes Wilson to swap them and put Kadri up and Ke$$el down to the 4th line. There will definately be some scraps tonight. Has Komi come down with Lucic flu yet?

525422,ctranter,2010-12-05 02:39:00,543," Plekanec is a stick swinging coward.  I will never forget his dangerous attack in the minor leagues, and somebody needs to show this fool a good ol fashion hip check."

525433,Guest Johnny Bass,2010-12-05 03:03:00,0," Ke$$el scores the game winner!!! He had Thomas so scared he put the puck AND the goalie in the net!!!!!!!  :rofl2:  :rofl2:  I thought Seguin was a healthy scratch, since there was no sign of him. At least he showed up for the shootout!  Star of the game? Thomas. He makes that over rated Boston team look alot better then they really are! Still, when Thomas was making those saves, He was smiling like it was an easy win against the leafs. When Beauchamin almost buried it? He wasn't smiling anymore!  I like his mask. Its similar to Hasek's and you get good vision.  No word of a lie. I was saying how Verseeg was by far the best player on the ice, and if he keeps going at it, he will bury a goal and he did! Kuleiman was a distant second.  Over all, leafs played well. If it wasn't for Thomas we would have buried the Bruins.  Rosehill(sp?) played awesome at the beginning. Caused a couple of turnovers, like I said he would. Caused a retaliation, but he shouldn't have fought and drew the penalty! He got manhandled in that scrap. After that, he was almost invisible.  We came out swinging, bombarding the net, caused one turnover and the Bruins capitalized. I'm sure the Bruin fans were all excited.LOL  Well there goes the Bruins streak of winning when they score first!!! Now you will excuse me as I go celebrate!"
520837,Chance,2010-11-17 03:36:00,420,  As soon as burke traded for Kessel everyone semed to think that was the end of the rebuilding process.Yet look at the average age of the players on the roster.
520838,lookinforwalleye,2010-11-17 03:37:00,4399,  That should have read 80 assists and not points!

The only thing Montreal has better then the leafs is a coach. They play a great defensive game because of him, and they have some chemistry going. Our players are all new.  Price has been playing great but I think he is going to fall apart come playoff time!!!Looking forward to playing Montreal on Saturday!!!  Canadadude. The montreal/philidelphia game was riddled with penalties also. With Montreal Scoring 2 power play goals."

We have a chance to get back in the playoff run. I just dont know what Giguere will say. He doesn't want to be a back up goalie. He said he would rather retire but we have another rookie goalie. Oh well, Guigere used to be a good goalie......  When Armstrong comes back we will have 3 solid lines.Like I said. We trade Kaberle for a forward, pick up a free agent and we are on our way to the playoffs!"

520686,Guest Johnny Bass,2010-11-16 23:31:00,0,Like I said. Trade Kaberle for a forward and use the money we have in the coffers for a top scoring free agent. And we will have a first line.

520794,Guest Johnny Bass,2010-11-17 02:33:00,0," WOOOHOOOOOOO!! What a game!!!!  Do you even watch the games? He has been setting up players, they haven't been putting the puck in the net. He's no Yzerman or Gretxky, but he is a good player. You notice his speed draws alot of penalties, because they cant keep up with him. He had alot of shots on net tonight, but he only had one truly great scoring chance in front and he missed(I was surprised).  We will see at the end of the season what Kessel is all about. Right now? Talk is cheap."
520801,lookinforwalleye,2010-11-17 02:40:00,4399, The only problem with that is truly good free agents or top scoring free agents are becoming a rare commodity with team locking up their good players long term i.e Jeff Carter and David Backes recently. Not much in the way of top quality free agents next year excluding Semin of course.
520807,Guest Johnny Bass,2010-11-17 02:46:00,0,"Its funny. When we were loosing 3 to 0, I was going to post this. Dont worry guys, all we need is a goal and a couple of power play goals.No word of a lie.  But when it was 4 to 1? I admit I was losing hope. Then they scored not only 2 power play goals but 4!!!!Our power play has really picked up! One timers, traffic in front of the net and everything. Guigere let in 3 weak goals! Win or lose I was going to say and everyone knows that I think that The monster has been the better goalie. And what do you know? The monster comes in and makes some HUGE saves with all that pressure on him, but I think there was much more pressure on Guigere.  That call was Bull on goalie interference I think! That goalie tried to save it and he missed the puck! We've lost some games(and won one) this year on bad calls, and soft penalties!  Good move putting Versteeg on the point for sure!Hopefully our scoring starts to pick up from here on!!!  Go leafs Go!!!"
520811,lookinforwalleye,2010-11-17 02:56:00,4399, Your obviously convinced that Kessel is a great player and Burke is convinced seeing he mortgaged the Leafs short term prospects but as you so eloquently stated talk is cheap!

520817,Guest Johnny Bass,2010-11-17 03:08:00,0, He's better then anyone on the Montreal Canadian's team. That's for sure! Big deal. He gave up a few players that may have or may have not panned out. But I am suspicious about who he gave them to. That is why my brother doesn't want any American GMs!
520820,lookinforwalleye,2010-11-17 03:11:00,4399, Jason Blake is available in 2012!

520824,Chance,2010-11-17 03:17:00,420,"  Semin seems a bit soft,no? I know he puts in the goals and really that is all that matters but come playoff time he doesnt seem to do alot.I think what is needed are BIG forwards who can score and unfortunately they are rarely available."
520827,Grimace,2010-11-17 03:24:00,2020,"This is getting dumb.  Kessel is what he is, and that is fine.  Everyone calls him a forty goal scorer yet he has not scored forty goals in a season.  35 and 30 last year.  Funny if you score 35 goals and 25 assists your a sniper (kessel), if you score 35 goals every year and 45-50 assists your a play maker (sundin).  There is absolutely no point in bringing Sakic, Yzerman and the like into this conversation.  That is just silliness.   Sakic could bang in 50 in between setting up his linemates.  As a leaf fan and more importantly a hockey fan I at least try to keep a little bit of a level head when comparing players."
520829,Guest Johnny Bass,2010-11-17 03:26:00,0, We need scoring and he can score. We'll worry about the playoffs when we make it. Like you said. Our options are limited.
520830,Bernie,2010-11-17 03:29:00,3190,The NHL needs to put a team in Hamilton.
520832,Guest Johnny Bass,2010-11-17 03:31:00,0, Like seriously. Who does Kessel have to pass the puck to? He scored 30 goals and 25 assists playing 70 games and coming off an injury. He scored 36 goals and 24 assists in 70 games in the previous year. I think his numbers will improve with the right team mates.
520833,Grimace,2010-11-17 03:32:00,2020,We are one the worst teams on the league and you guys think semin is going to sign here?   Or Selanne will waive his no trade to come here when  he absolutely loves the city of Anaheim.   This is dreaming.   Burke has overestimated the talent here.  If he thought the leafs were this bad he could not have ever pulled the trigger in the kessel deal.   We are in a real pickle here in Toronto.
520834,Chance,2010-11-17 03:33:00,420,  I haven't really watched semin enough to really comment but he looks like the kind of player that needs a good set up man.I think we need a good power forward AND a set up man for kessel.
520835,Grimace,2010-11-17 03:34:00,2020,Kessel is the guy that gets passed to.  You think he is a playmaker?   Well he isn't.
520439,Pikeslayer,2010-11-16 13:49:00,1443,"Just thought I'd post this poll for fun. I personally don't think that Burke can't hang on to his buddy for much longer. There is no one else to blame at this point because this is Burke's team now (I think the only pre-Burke players are Kaberle and maybe Schenn??) For the record, I'm calling Sunday Dec 5th, after the Boston game."
520451,bucktail,2010-11-16 14:04:00,1857,Can i request you add the rest of the management and scouting staff to that......oh and the teachers Pension fund too!
520458,blaque,2010-11-16 14:29:00,2419,Keep him till seasons end. One less team for my sabres to have to crawl over on their quest out of the basement
520476,Aaron Shirley,2010-11-16 15:38:00,655,"Hahaha, too funny Blaque.  I am a realist, and even 5 games into the season, I thought they would go into their typical mid-season slump, then come out on fire as the regular season winds down. They would be fighting to try and make the last playoff spot and be a little better than last year. I thought they would finish somewhere between 8th to 10th in the eastern conference. I didn't think they would be fighting to get out of last place again and give Boston another top player.  As it's looking now, Boston will be a big force in a few years with excellent building blocks in key young players with Toronto's picks (what Toronto should have done to rebuild). The Kessel trade will be what Burke is known for in Leafs land in the future. This will be his Leafs mark and what everyone will remember that stands out when they remember the Burke era. I think he is leaps and bounds better than Ferguson overall, but got on the wrong side of the NHL trade of the decade.  Kessel is a good 30 plus goal scorer, but that is the extent of his game. Sundin was more of a well rounded player and VERY strong on the puck. Sundin was more of a franchise player than Kessel, and he still didn't have a chance for a cup with Toronto.  I hate to say this as a Leafs fan, but I believe that until the Leafs start to rebuild from the ground up with the type of picks they traded to Boston, they will never be competitive enough for a serious run to see Stanley. Burke has set the rebuilding of Toronto back a few years IMO. Yes, I know it's a lottery in the draft, but to have the top draft pick (or close to it) for a few years in this salary cap era, it is the smartest way to have a good foundation for rebuilding a solid team.  Just a thought... maybe Burke is getting paid secretly by Boston's top brass LOL"
520486,torco,2010-11-16 16:04:00,656,"I can't see a coaching change making much of a difference.  Burke made some mistakes trying to rebuild this team and I'm sure he knows it. He'll need to hatch a new plan sooner than later but giving up 2 first rounders and a 2nd for kessel has to hurt.  Anyways not much Wilson can do.  The leafs lack a real #1 and #2 centre although maybe grabovski can be a #2  And if you look at the wingers they lack size and skill. By that I mean they have guys with size on the 3rd and 4th line like brown, and orr.  But in terms of guys with skill and size, maybe kulemin?  Anyways poorly constructed team that not even Scotty Bowman could make better if he was behind the bench."
520501,lookinforwalleye,2010-11-16 16:50:00,4399,"You guys just don`t get it this is a great team with great players,they just need time for the chemistry to gel!!!"
520504,Chance,2010-11-16 17:02:00,420," Too bad really I was enjoying the intelligent hockey talk.You claimed to be a wealth of hockey knowledge,it would be refreshing to see it displayed."
520540,Grimace,2010-11-16 18:53:00,2020,Leafs everything has to go.   Ugh.
520554,Guest Johnny Bass,2010-11-16 19:21:00,0," People think that coach changes rarely make a difference, though If I recall correctly? Bringing Ted Nolan to coach the Sabres, turned that team right around. And they didn't have much talent either.  He's got to go, and so does the goalie coaches...."
520557,jedimaster,2010-11-16 19:22:00,3472,"I am banking on theleafs edging out the 74/75 caps. 8-67-5 Well if they play the rest of the season like this, you never know.  Honestly You could put the top 10 coaches behind the bench and it won't make much of a difference. they are what everyone said. A basement dweller again.I was hoping with solid goal tending they could hver around the 50-50 mark but they are going to have to average better then 2 goals per game. They are 11th in the league in goals against but second last in goals for. They do have decent defense, and decent goal tending. The only way to measure that is goals against. The offense obviously needs a boost big time. I hope Kadri can light a fire somehow. Perhaps we can make a deal for center.  Its gonna take a player aquisistion to turn this around not a coaching change and burke knows that."
520606,Grimace,2010-11-16 21:07:00,2020,There is no one to deal and we have no draft picks.   By the time my son is old enough to root for a team he might look elsewhere.   The leafs are losing a whole generation of fans.
520607,jediangler,2010-11-16 21:09:00,1923,"Burke won't get rid of Wilson. Remember he is trying to win the cup...for his hometown team. Wilson will go when Burke goes and as long as the money rolls in, that won't happen. The Leafs are lucky that a few other teams have really tanked this year or else they would be at the bottom already."
520615,ADB,2010-11-16 21:37:00,444," Do you honestly think Wilson will last another three years (how much longer Burke has on his deal) if they continue at this pace?  The money rolling in has nothing to do with it, either.  The Leafs are worth more than any other NHL team, and that has never stopped them from firing coaches in the past..."
520622,canadadude,2010-11-16 21:47:00,769,Brian Burke has money and he's out shopping right now.........maybe he can pull a rabbit outa the hat yet
520631,blaque,2010-11-16 21:58:00,2419," Bingo......They were known to be referred to as the hardest working team in hockey at that time.  They had to work hard based on some of the middle of the road talent on the ice.  FYI, ruff seems to have lit a bit of a fire under them somehow. They've grabbed 9 of their last available 10 points. Beating washington and vancouver in OT the last two.  Ya know ya'll are free to adopt our hockey team down here if things are that bad up in TO. Just watch em' on the tube, dont be snatchin up all our tickets."
520634,asdve23rveavwa,2010-11-16 22:03:00,2690,"I am, and, always have been a Leafs fan...but seriously...MAKE THE PAIN GO AWAY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  I'm starting to think we just need to blow up the whole franchise and start new. I've said in the past few years, the last time they won the cup...I was in diapers, AND, the next time they win...I'll probably be in diapers again!!!!!  Although that might be optimistic"
520663,Guest Johnny Bass,2010-11-16 23:05:00,0," That's right. Time to ship Kaberle NOW for a consistent forward! If he continues to play the way he has been playing? No one will want him. Is he doing it on purpose so he doesn't get traded?  And yes, Burke still has enough money to pick up a top Goal scoring free agent.  I just dont know what to do with Phaneuf? He's an expensive liability. And like I said. When Johnson comes back, he better be producing at $3 mil.  All the bad mouthing about Kessel?I was looking at Kessel's stats. He has 8 goals and 2 assists, but if you look at all the times he perfectly fed his team mates and they screwed up? You would know that his points should be higher. Kessel will evolve into Toronto's francise player. Especially when he gets some support."
520666,Chance,2010-11-16 23:12:00,420,Unfortunately I think Phaneuf will be around for years to come.At times he seems to try too hard to contribute offensively which leads to struggles defensively.If he could get rid of this part of his game he would be fine. Kessel as everyone points out is very one dimensional.Fortunately that one dimension is goal scoring.As you mentioned with a good supporting cast he will start scoring on a regular basis.Not sure if he will be a franchise player but he will find the back of the net plenty of times.
520669,misfish,2010-11-16 23:15:00,29133,"LISTENING TO THE RADIO,THERES RUMBLINGS THAT THE PLAYERS ARE SHUTTING WILSON OUT.  PLAYERS MAY HAVE HAD ENOUGH."
520670,Guest Johnny Bass,2010-11-16 23:17:00,0," I disagree. Kessel's got speed and is a really great play maker also. I also like it when he rushes up the ice, slams on the breaks, waits for support to come in and makes great plays. He's the only leaf player that does that. He got spooked in the Boston game and he let them get under his skin. Once he picks himself up, he will be racking up the points."
520672,Chance,2010-11-16 23:21:00,420,"  Cant really blame them,there is only so much you can take.Combine that with their current downward spiral and Ghandi would be pissed!"
520676,Chance,2010-11-16 23:23:00,420,"  True....I think MacArthur is alot like Stempniak,trouble scoring until a team change.Still seems like a flash in the pan though."
520677,Guest Johnny Bass,2010-11-16 23:24:00,0," A center, winger or both! He definitely needs help!"
520679,Chance,2010-11-16 23:24:00,420,"  You have a good point.Hopefully he keeps improvingb that part of his game,we need all the up ice rushes we can get."
520681,F7Firecat,2010-11-16 23:25:00,347,"I thought a few weeks ago you guys were planning the parade?  Sellout another one, sell them all out,  no one upsatirs cares, show em the money, thats what its all about."
