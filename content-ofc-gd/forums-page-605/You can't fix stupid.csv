Barrie police say one man was charged after he drove up to the RIDE check, while consuming a beer.  Another was charged after he tried to avoid the check.  Both lost their vehicles for seven days.  A third man was handed a three day suspension after blowing a warning. Police say he also had attempted to avoid the check.  In total, officers checked 300 vehicles."

525393,Joey,2010-12-05 01:07:00,9122,"Well I was disgruntled to drive beside a police officer all the way up 16th Avenue this morning while he chatted on his cell phone, even making several calls.  Looked like some nice casual conversation with laughing etc."
525394,mercman,2010-12-05 01:10:00,7054,  and thats all i have to say about that.

525458,danc,2010-12-05 04:10:00,4677,Went through a ride check tonight in Red Lake. I thanked the guys for doing their job. Tis the season I guess..
525465,tb4me,2010-12-05 04:23:00,3295,"Yes I have Big respect for our officers. But the other day I seen a lady opp officer,in her car talking on a cell phone, I was not impressed."
525473,kickingfrog,2010-12-05 04:41:00,8333,ONE: It is NOT against the law for police to drive while using a cell phone. Understand the law.  TWO: Some drunk bozo goes through a ride check with a beer and we're worried about a cop on the phone? Get some perspective please.  Good night.
525477,irishfield,2010-12-05 04:48:00,26272,"I guess people get tired of it's not fine for you.. but we'll do as we please Rob. I can pay attention as well as a police officer can while talking on my phone... but they can do it legally. I can probably outdrive most of them too.. but they take my truck away for doing the speeds they like to cruise the 400 at WITHOUT their lights on...  As for the open beer while pulling up to a ride check.. at least he made it easy for them to stick him in the cruiser. Some may pull up with their witts about them at 1am and say ""yes officer, I've had 7 beer since 6pm... to have them say ""thanks.. we've got bigger problems than that""! And YES.. that is an actual conversation.. after 18 beer! ( I won't say who)"
525499,fishing n autograph,2010-12-05 14:56:00,2540," Joey, read the HTA, emergency service workers including hydro, gas, utilities etc are exempt from the cell phone law while on duty....bad guys have scanners so we have to communicate another way"
525500,fishing n autograph,2010-12-05 14:59:00,2540,And why I can't something that wasy while doing RIDE...we did a joint task force with South Simcoe on Friday night in Bradford...and of all places I got screamed at by 4 elderly asian women for stopping their car lol....
525503,fishing n autograph,2010-12-05 15:05:00,2540, Wow...I could see a drunk getting through a spot check because it's hard sometimes to tell because you get a 15 second interaction with no observation of their driving...but after being told that you had that much to drink and not give a road side...well that's just lazy
525526,irishfield,2010-12-05 16:15:00,26272,I guess if you are able to talk directly to the officer with your head out the window.. not hide.. not slur.. calculate in your head how many beer you could have had in that many hours and still be legal.. well.. maybe the person isn't a risk.

525530,Terry,2010-12-05 16:24:00,14456," and I guess cops can't figure out how to use bluetooth  they may be exempt..but it does not make it right........do as I say not as I do, gets tired real soon"
525532,Dondorfish,2010-12-05 16:29:00,1000,   What ever happened to lead by example?   Tracker ( Don )
525535,fishing n autograph,2010-12-05 16:39:00,2540,"Yeah, I agree we're told that if you're gonna use your phone use a blue tooth, or just get off the road...lead by example I guess...I avoid my cell...gives ne a reason not to answer when the wife calls lol  Or irish...it could be what's called functional alcoholism...when you drink a lot, your body gets used to functioning drunk so when an alcoholic is confronted either on the street or in his car, he may seem fine because he or she is used to having ahigh BAC...makes it tough to spot unless you give them a lot of divided attention questions or a divided attention test battery that's when they'll fall apart"
525537,Joey,2010-12-05 16:44:00,9122," My point exactly!!!  I was not trying to take away from the idiot at the ride check which was the point of your thread Kickingfrog, I was replying to a thread entited ""You can't fix stupid."""
525539,fishing n autograph,2010-12-05 16:50:00,2540,Its even more fun when you find drivers passed out behind the wheel with a beer in their hand....
525541,misfish,2010-12-05 16:53:00,29133,"I remember when they asked you to walk a stright line.If you could,on yerway.  That guy was pretty dumb.  And yes,lead by example.   If you can afford to go out drinking,you can afford a cab to get ya home."
525816,skeeter,2010-12-06 14:04:00,1907,"fishNautographs, have you ever stopped a guy like this???????????  "
525824,fishing n autograph,2010-12-06 14:19:00,2540,"haha i wish, would make it more interesting.....last guy i caught was begging to be kept in jail because he wife was gonna kill him lol"
