524551,jimmer,2010-12-02 14:17:00,2730,"Yes, I agree!  It won't be long before I have nothing left from my weekly pay cheque, which never goes up! I guess I'm lucky that I live on a lake and can paddle out to go fishing once the gas prices go too high or gas is no longer available. Sorry to say it, but playing fishing games takes hydro :-("
524555,bow slayer,2010-12-02 14:33:00,1074," well if you are talking st.thomas the price here is 109.5 everywhere,the website seems to be not up to date in prices."
524705,bigbuck,2010-12-02 20:05:00,2449,"Oh the joy of having a PM from Alberta. You have to think who finances Mr Harper's campaign. So, that said, we won't be getting any sort of a break on fuel any time soon. BTW, I am Conservative in my political views, I'm just calling it like I see it in my little world."
524935,Steve Piggott,2010-12-03 14:04:00,196,I switch my F150 over to propane two years a go and don't care about gas prices anymore.I have been paying anywhere From 55 to 65 cents per litre since. I save 30 to 40 dallars per fill up.
524943,Fish Farmer,2010-12-03 14:33:00,2234,"I can see were this is going, lots of trucks, boats and resorts for sale. Economy going down the pipe.  and they want us to take concessions and tax us to death, HMMMM smart people we have running the country. Lets give more money away Blood pressure going up again  , got to go down and polish some lures for Quinte next week."
524951,Twocoda,2010-12-03 14:53:00,4130,"And now for something .....completely different!!!   'Mom, may I take the dog for a walk around the block?'  Mom replies, 'No, because she is in heat.  'What's that mean?' asked the child.  'Go ask your father. I think he's in the garage.'  The little girl goes to the garage and says, 'Dad, may I take Belle for a walk around the block? I asked Mom, but she said the dog was in heat, and to come to you.'  Dad said, 'Bring Belle over here.' He took a rag, soaked it with gasoline, and scrubbed the dog's backside with it to disguise the scent, and said 'OK, you can go now, but keep Belle on the leash and only go one time round the block.'  The little girl left and returned a few minutes later with no dog on the leash. Surprised, Dad asked, 'Where's Belle?'  The little girl said, 'She ran out of gas about halfway down the block, so another dog is pushing her home.'  If you ain't laffin'... You ain't livin'"

525025,irishfield,2010-12-03 18:22:00,26272,113.9 in Midland this morning (with no choice but to fill up).. only to find it @ 109.9 in Waverly. Guess the rotary crank phone operators call got delayed to way out there in the sticks! lol That station is usually the most expensive around..
525074,Snowball,2010-12-03 20:39:00,167,"$1.219 in Thunder Bay......to-day. Merry Christmas!  Regards, Snowball"
525328,ketchenany,2010-12-04 20:20:00,3229," At Jane/Dundas/St Clair/ (independents outlets) area gas is ALWAY 3-4 cents below what we pay in Weston and the 401/Woodbridge area; my last fill up was 1.06.  Our government (a bunch of idiots and that is just me) really knows how to discourage visitors; taxing everything that keeps them from coming here. Gas, HST etc. I'm NO economist but if you tax people to death they have no disposable income, which slows down the economy.  Do you not think that the transportation industry will not pass on these fuel cost? Prices will go up and they collect more taxes . . . and we fall farther behind.  I hope that our next governors will realize that taxing us to death is not the solution; we have to have the $s to spend and keep everyone else going; from food stores to recreational activities/tourism.  The more we have to spend the more they get, but if you take it up front!  I'd like to know how many of our American friends have decided not to come because of the transportation/HST costs . . ."
525350,fishfarmer2,2010-12-04 21:34:00,76, K looks like have to park the (Truck) the (Boat) cant afford to Fish getting to expensive sorry hope this does not offend any one aaaa
524353,ketchenany,2010-12-01 23:23:00,3229,"We are getting it up the  again after midnight, an increase of 4.5 cents!"
524357,DRIFTER_016,2010-12-01 23:29:00,10439,"Last week ours went up 83 cents a liter, due to enviromental reasons. The ferry was shut down due to low water and fuel had to be flown in. But now the ferry is running again and gas is back to normal #1.169 a liter. I love how our gas prices stay unchanged for months or even longer up here. None of the price fluctuation Bull like in Onatrio."
524375,bigugli,2010-12-01 23:48:00,6138,Guess I'll just have to stay home and drink. It's cheaper than driving  The economy can never get rolling as long as the consumer has neery a penny left to spend.
524377,irishfield,2010-12-01 23:50:00,26272,"The gas is the cheap part of the day it seems. Between parking and meals in, or just outside, the hospital we're going thru about $130 a day for every day Jen is in Sinai. Thank God we don't have a $150 to $200 hotel bill as well. Can't imagine how many get thru this experience with a family member in a downtown hospital, that don't live there."

524388,bigugli,2010-12-01 23:57:00,6138,"If it's a child in hospital, they can often hook you up with McDonald House. Otherwise, Ive spent a few nights sleeping in lobbies and waiting rooms. Hotels just weren't an option."

Get your son-in-law to buy you a tank of gas for Christmas.. will cover the anal rise in price for a bit from your pocket! lol  Bruce.. we can sleep in the hospital room on the chemo floor if she is in the ICU style room.. but not my cup-a-tea to have a nurse see me spooning with Leah in the night! They also have a deal with Weston Harbour Castle (just for the 6 chemo patient rooms)... if you ask.. and if they have room the weston will put you up for FREE. An option we may take at some point to get off Jen's pull out couch. Ronald McD house is building a new facility on McCaul.. right behind Sinai.

524438,mike rousseau,2010-12-02 02:18:00,4661,I'm lucky I guess... 10 minutes to a reservation... Gas is cheaper there... Under $3 a gallon... I save $40 per fill up when I also bring a tank my boat...
524439,Nipfisher,2010-12-02 02:23:00,2449, Why would you spoon when you can fork?

524505,irishfield,2010-12-02 05:05:00,26272,They'd be really good if they took the other 24.7 cents of provincal and federal road taxes off before they added the HST as well Raf !!
524506,Raf,2010-12-02 05:08:00,3495,i thought taxes on taxes were illeg...
524507,irishfield,2010-12-02 05:15:00,26272,"..but they're not really a ""tax"".. lol Same crap with AV gas.. not supposed to be any road tax on it.. so they slapped a 2.7% excise tax on it decades ago to pay for the Flight Service network (that most of us never use). Said system was sold out and privatized about 10 years ago now, and they refuse to remove the excise tax.. that then has HST charged on top of the total."
524510,Carp,2010-12-02 05:28:00,1488,  I'm fed up with all the fuel price Bull too. I was in the market for a new vehicle. Rising fuel prices made my decision easier. Just leased a 2011 VW Jetta with a 2.0 litre turbo diesel engine. (torque 236 lbs.- ft. ) Should be picking it up in the next few days.
524531,Fish Farmer,2010-12-02 12:36:00,2234,Just killing the country. Soon we'll be sitting at home playing fishing games. Maybe that's their game plan for thinking GREEN.
