The wife and daughter have serious health problems, and the relationship with the son has been anything but easy. With one piece of bad news after another, and my wife's condition getting progressively worse, I figgered Christmas was going to be another horrible experience. This morning the son asked me to run him to the tackle shop ( police pulled the plates on his rust bucket) Nothing new in browsing there. I can do that every week. Any how my son tells me it's time for something better than the backpack, so I'm getting a new ice hut for an early Christmas present. Of course it also means that he will have to get out with me every weekend.  http://www.icefish.com/catalog/item.php  It certainly is more than my broken body can handle by myself. He didn't have to, and he should not have, but I am still a little off guard, and certainly as tickled as a school boy with a new toy. Like the Grinch, I'm feeling ""all tingly inside"", and I may just have sprung a leak."

Get that leak you sprung fixed before you get out in your new portable hut"
