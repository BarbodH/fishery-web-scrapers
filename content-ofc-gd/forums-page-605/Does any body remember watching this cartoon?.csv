525941,bigugli,2010-12-06 19:41:00,6138,The Canajun answer to Commander Tom was Uncle Bobby.   Every once in a while we used to get the signal for Capt. Kangaroo and Mr Greenjeans.  
525955,Rod Caster,2010-12-06 20:33:00,5784,That cartoon (one randy posted) was one of my favs as well...I used to try and draw them in flipbooks as a kid.
