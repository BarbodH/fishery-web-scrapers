But is means the ice is super thin.  The ice was making that noise in Bancroft a few weeks back.  We sat there for 30 minutes tossing rocks."
525485,hockeyplayerz_14,2010-12-05 06:09:00,160," Ya thats what I also thought. But as you can see, I was there for a good 20 mins. tossing rocks"

525573,Woodsman,2010-12-05 19:51:00,1286,"Big, Middle or Little Doe. I have stayed on Little Doe many times but always had better luck on Big Doe during open water. Only icefished once on Doe & it was on Little Doe. Mostly small to medium perch & some small to medium walleye. Without a fishfinder I would have never caught the suspended walleye.  Rick"
