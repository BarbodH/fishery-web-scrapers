Im sure a lot of you guys have been here fishing. I dont know what happened,but whatever did, I hope their safe! At this time of year belwwood, conestoga and all the rest of the resevoirs open up their dams to lower the water levels. Dont be a fool or a static. Be safe! I recall a while back(20 yrs or so)taking my little cousin out to caledonia in early spring for some fishing. Low and behold there were firemen,grapling hooks and a hovercraft in search of three men the were tossed into the river. The water was high, and they were fishing out of a tinner at the face of the Dam in early spring. Be Safe Folks, the river is fast and furious!"
525923,misfish,2010-12-06 18:18:00,29133,Worth a call to the authoritys.Give them the boat number.
525926,vinnimon,2010-12-06 18:25:00,2593,"  Theres probably no need, Im sure they know already! Theres an old age apartment complex there, and all the balconies and windows face the dam."
525932,Fish4Eyes,2010-12-06 18:35:00,1022,"Very dangerous near that dam. I often pull up and let the motor idle in neutral to see what the current is doing before I toss out the anchor. I have had several snagged anchors and as you keep tugging on the rope to try to free it, you only pull closer to the dam. My rule is start the motor and prepare something to cut the anchor rope with prior to pulling in an anchor. Problem is, the closer you are the better the walter fishing is"
525947,vinnimon,2010-12-06 20:07:00,2593,"  You are absolutely correct! I lucked out this summer, after a 1/2 hour of tugging and to drag something down stream. A log from what I felt! The tug was done by my engine! Next time I will cut the rope!A persons life is worth more than saving an anchor and rope. I always has the engine running and my hand on the throttle. I have also been that close in a canoe with some fear in the back of my mind! But not much worries."
525960,tb4me,2010-12-06 21:01:00,3295,Wow and Yikes. where was that? Looks like dunville but im not sure..

526013,bigugli,2010-12-06 23:54:00,6138,"Also possible that the boat washed off someone's  shoreline with all the rain and wind just recently, and drifted downstream. Happens every year."
526031,BiggFish,2010-12-07 01:07:00,40,"Hey Vinimon,  Any fish at the dam?  What were you targeting? CHad"
526044,vinnimon,2010-12-07 01:43:00,2593,"Received a call back! It was reported on the 4rth, no tragedies! Washed down river! Thank God!  "
