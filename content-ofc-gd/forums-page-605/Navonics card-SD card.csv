525176,Pigeontroller,2010-12-04 02:05:00,2793,Try Jocelyn at Angling Outfitters in Woodstock.
525190,Handlebarz,2010-12-04 02:50:00,3790,2nd Angling outfitters call them and see what they have as I bought mine there used for $50 or so.
525197,walleyejack,2010-12-04 03:16:00,358,"right on,was just reading reviews on the cards, are they in meters or feet, one guy bought one and was unhappy cause it was in meters,am not interested if it is. thanks"
525356,jjcanoe,2010-12-04 22:10:00,744,your gps or finder should be able to switch the setting on it.....
525371,Gerritt,2010-12-04 23:17:00,6129,"#3 on Jos at Angling outfitters, he is top notch"
525372,smally21,2010-12-04 23:23:00,993,i bought mine of ebay pretty cheap but it was a coupe of years old.  2010 cards are 200+ but you can get a 2008 for around 60.  still the same lake you know?
525378,irishfield,2010-12-04 23:38:00,26272,Exactly smally.. unless you need one of the lakes that is on the latest and greatest.. the older SD's work just fine. My Great Lakes and 2007 Navonics cards cover everything I fish..
525383,Bernie,2010-12-04 23:55:00,3190,"To be honest I am not pleased with the Navionics for Nipissing. There are Islands completely missing and shoals not marked. I will be looking for something else to use for next summer. More than pleased with the sonar, but the gps sucks. I'm thinking of looking at a Garmin setup. The map I have on my handheld Rhino is right on. It uses the actual lake chart."
525389,mike rousseau,2010-12-05 00:49:00,4661,If you have an iPhone... Navionics great lakes map is only 10 bucks!!!  And your iPhone is a gps... I tested it and it was bang on...  $10  I was a little upset because I paid over $200 for my navionics map!
525403,walleyejack,2010-12-05 01:36:00,358,"Well i need the card that is a few years old, so im told, my 502c is 4yrs old and won't read the new cards, is what they told me at Lebarons,he could have just sold me one anyway and i take it and it doesn t work,then im out 200,so i guess i look around for something a few yrs old."
525988,smally21,2010-12-06 22:26:00,993,some one mentioned nipissing not sure if original poster but lake maps premium shows nothing of that area
