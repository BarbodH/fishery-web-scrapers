526037,ctranter,2010-12-07 01:15:00,543,"Im looking to grab 1 (maybe several) Tica Cetus for the upcoming hardwater season.  Does anyone know if there is a retailed in the GTA (willing to trek across the golden horseshoe) that carries them?  I didn't see any at Gagnon's or Bass pro, but I wasn't really focused on finding them at that time.  Any help is much appreciated.  Looking for Tica Cetus SB500"
