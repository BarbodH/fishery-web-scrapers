525352,Dondorfish,2010-12-04 21:50:00,1000,A freind of mine has two of these things - those dogs are NUTS!!! - they never get tired and never stop - even the one that has to be close to 10 years old - more energy then most 10 week old pups of most other breeds. I never stop laughing at them!   Tracker ( Don )
