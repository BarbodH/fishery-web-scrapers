525303,Grimace,2010-12-04 18:05:00,2020,"Crosby's first couple of years in Pittsburgh did not help there standings either, nor Ovechkin in Washington, nor Teows and Kanes in Chicago, nor Stamkos in Tampa Bay.  It takes a few years.  Don't worry, Hall and Seguin will be just fine.  2 more years.  Again, you can not compare 18 year olds to 23 year olds.  Like I said before Kessel only potted 11 goals in his first year and you seem to think he is amazing.  Well Hall already has that and Seguin is sneaking up on that and you shrug it off.  Face it man, it was a bad trade."
525357,Rod Caster,2010-12-04 22:12:00,5784,  Watch tonight...Seguin facing the leafs
525427,ctranter,2010-12-05 02:53:00,543,"Do you like apples Boston?  Kessel just scored the game winner in the shootout.  How do ya like them apples?  Leafs problems are FAR FROM OVER, but tonight's win felt really, really, good."
525431,tb4me,2010-12-05 02:58:00,3295,THANK YOU BOSTON THANK YOU BOSTON THANK YOU BOSTON
525434,uglyfish,2010-12-05 03:05:00,981,"Forget kessel's winner.... Did u see that goal by kadri?!? Or how about thomas' OT save on beauchemin!!  Prolly the best game the leafs played all season. Forecheck was strong, short passes kept them moving up ice with speed, and lots of shots to the net. Only reason that game wasn't over long before was tim thomas and his outstanding play. Leafs deserved that win. Giguere played great too, 2 goals on 2 bad giveaways.  Kessel played his best game in a couple weeks."
525437,Roy,2010-12-05 03:12:00,13728,I just rented an office atop the old MacLean-Hunter building for some good shots on the parade route.
525439,irishfield,2010-12-05 03:16:00,26272,What the hell you do that for Roy. Joe has window seats for free and has Geoff storing the barracades in the basement at Queen and University!  I actually drove the route (well at least the block) three times last night making sure everything was ready to go!!!  (...looking for a parking spot for supper with my sweetheart!)
525442,Roy,2010-12-05 03:27:00,13728,"I just enjoy being a little closer to Queen's Park, Wayne."
525445,sconceptor,2010-12-05 03:29:00,146,"As a who ever is playing the Leafs fan, a few things I didn't like tonight:  1) Don Cherry saying it's wrong to boo these guys.  Sure Brown plays hard, but the whole dam team is losing 5-0 to a team that they should compete with, and it's their 6th time being shut out all season(1/4 of their games).  Fans pay huge money to be there, and if they're lifer leafs fans, or casual fans of hockey, it's in their rite to boo the Leafs for their poor play!!!!!  2) The whole ""Leafs win, Leafs win"" attitude at the end.  Players jumping around like they won the cup, and the annoucer doing his best to sound like they just won it all.  They should skate of the ice with there heads up for winning, but act they've been there, done it before and will do it again, not like this meant something."
525447,tb4me,2010-12-05 03:39:00,3295,This was a deserving win and the post game reaction was just fine. They had lots to celebrate. The end os a slump. Good for them. Now lets see if they can carry on with it!!! Go Leafs go!!

525463,John Bacon,2010-12-05 04:19:00,3277, Maybe they don't remember being there before (it's been awhile) and who knows when they will do it again
525483,jediangler,2010-12-05 06:07:00,1923,"Congrats to the Leafs for ending Timmy's 9 game, NHL all-time record streak, of wins on the road from the start of the season.  Why don't the Leafs play like that every night?"
525487,Guest Johnny Bass,2010-12-05 12:44:00,0," First? Thanks for showing some class. Second? I think they have played well all season, with some bad breaks, like poor last minute penalties, last second goals in Tampa and Buffalo.  We should have at least 3 extra wins(6 extra points)."
525494,Chance,2010-12-05 14:36:00,420,"I actually thoguht the Leafs played a terrible game.With the exception of some flashes of brilliance and good goal tending they were not very good.Numerous give aways that result from very poor positional play.Simple breakouts were being botched time and time again.Centers weren't swinging defence men were not shifting leterally and wingers looking over their shoulders.Every breakout is a finely tuned play with everyone having their role.When it doesnt work you move and adapt. No movement ,no adaptation. Beauchamin needs to go back to the basics,he is making minor league mistakes.Skating to the weak side and dumping a three foot pass to your flat footed partner is unexceptable.As is his poor timing on the winger along the boards.How many times does the winger needs to squeeeze by before he takes a chance and leans in to him early.That is a sign of a guy who is scared fo getting beat to the inside so delays the hit.  However a win is a win and maybe things will change."
525507,lookinforwalleye,2010-12-05 15:13:00,4399,  Chance knows his hockey! Take the points and move on!
525513,Chance,2010-12-05 15:38:00,420,  Thanks....I can handle a team that sucks but pros that dont get the basics I just cant fathom.Hal Gil has bothered me for years as he always turns the wrong way when he pivots.It works for him but every now and then he gets beat because of it.
525522,Rod Caster,2010-12-05 16:09:00,5784,  Hal Gill is one of the worst defencemen in the league. His best skill is having a 7 foot stick.
525523,Dondorfish,2010-12-05 16:13:00,1000,Leafs suck - always have - always will - nothing will change till they stop selling out all the seats - end of story  Last night they sucked a little less!   Tracker ( Don )
525549,misfish,2010-12-05 17:10:00,29133,  You noticed that too eh.
525613,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2010-12-05 22:46:00,0,"I watched the game.  Very entertaining.  Leafs played well.  Thomas was incredible.  He made half a dozen HUGE saves including ""the SAVE""...  As far as Cherry's comments, when has he NOT has his nose up the ass of MLSE?  At least he doesn't hide the fan that he's an obvious leafs fan, unlike the rest of the Toronto based sports media figures(tsn, cbc, sportsnet).  Every time I hear Joe Bowen call a game I want to vomit."
525639,uglyfish,2010-12-06 00:06:00,981,  sure bests the hell outta listening to buffalo's announcer... that guy is about as enjoyable as heartburn.
525691,Daplumma,2010-12-06 01:00:00,1961,Guess I'll get to see these Leafs in my house tomorrow nite playing my Caps. Joe
525713,jediangler,2010-12-06 01:42:00,1923,They love RJ (Rick Jenerette) in Buffalo but I can't stand him either. Lalalalalalalafontaine or Mayday mayday mayday.
524920,craigdritchie,2010-12-03 13:01:00,1586,I thought that was Mats Sundin?  Or Wendel Clarke?  Or Darryl Sittler?  Or Borje Salming?  How far do you want to go back?
524925,Chance,2010-12-03 13:25:00,420," Not sure when the last time you watched a hockey game was or sports in general but those players are all retired.Hence the statement ""we need a franchise player""."
524926,Grimace,2010-12-03 13:30:00,2020,I think he is trying to suggest that a franchise player will not make much of a difference giving the results of the last 30 years plus.
524931,jediangler,2010-12-03 13:52:00,1923,How many goals did Ke$$el get last night?
524944,Guest Johnny Bass,2010-12-03 14:33:00,0," Thats right. I always make the sure bets. I dont bet on the long shots. Some times they come through but its rare. There were alot of players that were supposed to be the next Gretxky and end up fizzling out.  But I do suspect that Burke had Boston's best interest on this trade.   That is right. They are all retired.  Clarke, Sundin and Sitler were very great players to say the least.  We had Sitler and McDonald.  We had Sundin and Mogilney.  We had Clarke, Gilmour and Andrechuk.  And we have Kessel and nobody.  And you think Seguin and nobody would have faired better?  Bottom line? Kessel needs some team mates.  I doubt Seguin will ever reach Kessel's talent but only time will tell.  I remember people telling me that Potvin was the best goalie in the world and I said he would flop and guess what happened...."
524945,Guest Johnny Bass,2010-12-03 14:37:00,0, How many did Seguin score? Did he even play?
524950,Rod Caster,2010-12-03 14:50:00,5784,"  13;17 TOI. Boston won 8-1 yesterday. Seguin is part of a team with great depth....exactly as you are saying J.B., is what Toronto is missing. Seguin will be a top notch player. Considering he is playing on a checking line as a rookie, his stats are pretty good. Toronto has depth in the minors, time will tell people, time will tell....Burke likes to give players an opportunity to mature before bringing them to the big leagues...just look at Getzlaf...one of the best players in the league spent almost 5 years in the minors."
524955,craigdritchie,2010-12-03 15:03:00,1586,"The kids don't get it, Grimace. They haven't been disappointed by this team for as many decades. Nor do they appreciate how many ""franchise players"" have come and gone since 1967 .... all without results.  Chance - yes, those guys are all grandfathers now. That's my point. Heck, I still remember Dave Keon being the guy who would bring the cup back to Toronto. He was a great player too.  Sittler played on teams WITH Lanny McDonald, Borje Salming, Ian Turnbull and Mike Palmateer. And yet? No cup. If that team couldn't win (playing against weak, post-expansion teams in the 70s) then this bunch of amateurs hasn't got a snowball's chance."
524965,Chance,2010-12-03 15:32:00,420," Appreciate being called a kid,haven't been called that for many years.  Anyhow as leaf fans we know the machine is broken and has been for many decades.Bring in big name players,spend huge dollars on them,keep the fans happy and all to no end.We get it ,we honestly do.But when you grow up supporting a team you just stick with it.I dont buy hats or shirts or anything else you mentioned earlier.In fact I dont buy any NHL paraphernalia,wearing a shirt with another guys name on the back seems silly to me. Every year we hope for a different result but dont expect it.This year seems a bit different than those of past.They are the youngest team in ther league and I dont remember that happening for a long time. They do have some very promising young players in the system so they are heading in the right direction.They ARE rebuilding regardless of how many times the mindless critics want to throw the Kessel trade around. Seguin and Hall are very good players and will be for years to com.Sure one of them could of been playing for the Leafs but they are not,get over it citics it is said done and sealed and delivered.Anyone claiming Kessel is not a good player is either a fool or just doesnt watch the game at all.I also find it quite humorous how all these critics come out of the woodwork yet fail to realize their team of choice did not win the cup last year either.Which is worse a team that struggles every year to make it over 500 and just doesnt or a team that is built to win the cup but doesn't?every year I watch the playoffs in hopes a Canadian team wins the cup.I really dont care who and of course the Leafs would be nice but I would like it back in Canada regardless."
524967,lhousesoccer,2010-12-03 15:51:00,442,
525036,Guest Johnny Bass,2010-12-03 19:10:00,0," You dont get it. Every team needs at least one franchise player. And it isn't Seguin.  So your saying they should have never got Keon?lol  We have a pretty good team, but we need more offense, and so far, Kessel has provided more offense then Seguin.  Best team was Burns(defensive coach) Gilmour, Andrechuk and Clark and a solid stay at home defense core."
525048,jbailey,2010-12-03 19:46:00,866,"i wouldn't expect a franchise player for a while.. in my opinion, atleast with Seguin the leafs had the CHANCE of following up with another solid draft pick - kind of like edmonton with eberle (drafted 22nd overall, Luke Schenn went 5th) and hall. Now they're stuck fishing for a ""franchise"" player to compliment Kessel, instead of being able to focus more on the team development. I personally believe in building from scratch, not little touch up patch work.  Anyway, the toronto rock's season starts in jan, now there is a team everyone should get behind!! GO ROCK GO!!!"
525049,Guest Johnny Bass,2010-12-03 19:49:00,0,"What I cant believe is how much we sucked Yesterday. Here we are playing a tired team that just played back to back, with the worst penalty kill in the league and we couldn't score a goal.  Is it me or do all players and goalies get out of their slumps when they play the leafs? I am hearing the same thing. Ohhh he wasn't supposed to play tonight, and he ends up scoring the game winner.  We need a longgggg winning streak!  I'm expecting a few player to pick up their game. Whether it will be this year or next, I dont know."
525054,jediangler,2010-12-03 20:13:00,1923,"If you don't bet on long shots, you've picked the wrong team to cheer for Johnny."
525081,craigdritchie,2010-12-03 20:58:00,1586,Where did I say that?  Did you even read my post?  I give up. This is like talking to a plant.
525083,misfish,2010-12-03 21:04:00,29133, Ya got that right. We have a couple of home grown boys here that play for them.
525089,Roy,2010-12-03 21:36:00,13728, Isn't a leaf part of a plant?
525107,muskymatt,2010-12-03 22:40:00,2608, Stink plant maybe
525154,Guest Johnny Bass,2010-12-04 01:06:00,0," Yes, I read it. Sorry we cant all have your stuperior intelligence!   You were basically saying that franchise players have not brought us a cup(to cover up your first dumb post). Right here. I asked, we need a Franchise player. A face for the team.  You said:I thought that was Mats Sundin?  Or Wendel Clarke?  Or Darryl Sittler?  Or Borje Salming?  How far do you want to go back?  Then we mentioned they were retired and then Grimace tried to save you by suggesting that Franchise players have done nothing for the leafs.  Does that mean we shouldn't get any franchise players? Franchise players sell shirts and tickets. Should we have a team of nobodies? Like we've had since Sundin left?  Who here owns a leaf shirt of anyone on this current team? I seen Phaneuf shirts at the store. Thats about it.  I can understand if this was years after the fact. We haven't even given the trade a chance and already the critics are   :blahblah1: .  Give it a couple of years and we will see!"
525175,uglyfish,2010-12-04 02:02:00,981,Sundin was not a franchise player! Am I the only one who noticed the leafs went downhill after they traded for sundin??
525181,Grimace,2010-12-04 02:31:00,2020,"I disagree.  I really liked Sundin.  Good work ethic, never complained, a good role model to the younger players. I think he was a franchise player.  I agree with Johnny that we need a franchise player.  However you do not get them by trading draft picks away for 1 dimensional 60 point guys.  I would much rather watch Edmonton lose every night and know help is on the way than watch my beloved Leafs get crushed every night and realize there is nothing in the farm, and we have no first round draft pick this year.  I am sorry but I am not drinking the Brian Burke Kool Aid.  I thought they might finish this year with a 40-32-8 record for 88 points and tenth in the conference but they would have to play some awefully good hockey for the rest of the year for that even.  There is no evidence to suggest that this is attainable."
525188,Chance,2010-12-04 02:48:00,420,  There are good players in the system.Jussi Rynnas and McKegg are a couple.
525198,wildeye rainbow,2010-12-04 03:16:00,123,"I'm glad that I can still remember (but barely) the last time that the Leafs won the Stanley Cup.  I was in Grade 7 and in a month and a half I am retiring.  Hmmm,..., nuff said.  The Leafs did a lot better with Pat Quinn as coach and GM - wasn't that the last time that they were in the playoffs??  Losing to the Oilers 5-0 - boy that is a real low point!"
525294,Guest Johnny Bass,2010-12-04 17:22:00,0," Agreed. Sundin was one of the most talent players in the NHL at the time. Anyone that has seen him play on Sweden's national team will tell you. They REALLY went down when Mogilney left, and Sundin had to carry the entire burden, just like Kessel.....   As far as Edmonton? Their first round draft pick(Taylor Hall) hasn't done much for the team's standings. They are still at the bottom of the barrel. But you can blame that on defense and goal-tending. For Toronto?We cant put the puck in the net. Edmonton needs some goaltending and we need a goal scorer/play maker. Only time will tell, which team will be more successful in the near future."
525297,jediangler,2010-12-04 17:41:00,1923,"The Oilers have won 3 in a row and will be better because they are rebuilding the right way, through the draft.  Last year the NorthEast division put 4 teams into the playoffs, more than any other division in the NHL. Only Toronto missed out. This year it looks like both Boston and Montreal are going to make it. What has happened to Buffalo and Ottawa?"
524262,tb4me,2010-12-01 17:30:00,3295,no band wagon jumping here..Im a leaf fan true and true. Always will be and to the haters all I can read is BLA BLA BLA..it will be our turn soon enough..I just hope you all can take it as much as ya all dish er out!  GO LEAFS GO!!!!

524275,addy79,2010-12-01 18:25:00,573,"  Come up with something new, better yet, go look for some walleye..."
524286,jedimaster,2010-12-01 18:54:00,3472,"The leafs get bad bounces the same as every other team. Out of 82 games, you are going to lose some on bad bounces. You can't blame every loss on bad bounces. They certainly got a few bounces their way last night.  They need to start scoring on a regular basis.If they scored 3 goals every game they would have won alot more games th would have won 6 more games outright so far, and tied 3 or 4, and we wouldn't be having this conversation as the leafs would have 15 more points putting them in second behind Detroit. Even just half of those points puts them in a play off spot and we are all planning the parade route. You can't score you can't win. Plain and simple.  The leafs goaltending has been good enough to gather points. They need to put the puck in the net without making stupid plays like last nights OT  game. If your a defensemen on a rush, shoot it and get back. Thats kinda the montra for defensemen in 4 on 4 hockey.   I don't blame this on the coach. I blame this on Burke. He needs to get a few more goal scorers and obviously a number 1 Center. Without a second line threat, Kessle is gonna have a rough time scoring.   I am not saying get rid of Burke. I think he has done a good job so far, but its his job to put the players on the ice. It may not be able to happen this year or next year even, but eitherway its on him to make deals or draft some talent. Blame whoever you want to but the fact is we need more talent up front. In the end thats the GM's job."
524288,jedimaster,2010-12-01 19:09:00,3472,The Leafs are 27th in Points 28th in Goals per Game 2.22 (not good at all) 16th in Goals Allowed per game 2.83(Should be good enough) 26th in Goal Differential per game at -0.61
524291,Stoty,2010-12-01 19:26:00,2910, LOL... nuff said!
524297,Rod Caster,2010-12-01 19:56:00,5784,"At least they are better than the oilers...talk about a team that has trouble rebuilding.  Remember the oilers cup run a couple years ago? They sucked all season, then BAM! they are in the playoffs and picking off teams...reminds me of how the Habs sucked last year then managed, some friggen how, to beat good teams. They still suck in my opinion but Gionta is doing  a great job as a leader and Price, to the relief or disgust or the Habs fans (who knows with them), is playing all star hockey.

524302,craigdritchie,2010-12-01 20:07:00,1586,I agree. I am confident they will soon be tied with the Islanders.

524467,jediangler,2010-12-02 03:17:00,1923,It wouldn't matter if the Leafs had all the draft picks in the first round. They would pick bad players or pick good players and make them bad by forcing that jersey on them. You know they passed on Tyler Myers for Luke Schenn? They passed twice on Milan Lucic and picked Tlusty and Kulemin instead. Lucic has more goals and points than Ke$$el by the way. Seguin scored tonight in Boston's 3-0 win over the Flyers and Thomas set an NHL record by being the first goalie in history to win his first 9 road games. Thanks again for that lottery pick in June 2011.
524478,Chance,2010-12-02 03:41:00,420,  The Leafs could win a cup and I am sure you would find fault somewhere.I just find myself wondering why you care so much?? Listing who teams have passed on is silly as EVERY team has made bad choices in the past. Lidstrom 53rd..Datsyuk 171st...Zetterberg 210th..
524490,John Bacon,2010-12-02 04:20:00,3277, That would be an improvement... the Jays aren't that bad.
524631,jedimaster,2010-12-02 17:47:00,3472,Whens the last time the Jays made the playoffs?
524826,John Bacon,2010-12-03 01:35:00,3277, 1993 - but that is not a fair comparison; the Jays have finished in the top 16 since then; unlike hockey that doesn't get you in the play offs.  The Jays do have season where they win more games then the lose.  The Leafs haven't done that in a while.
524829,daryl0815,2010-12-03 01:45:00,225,"Clearly the Leafs are back at it again tonight, 3-0 now, after Edmonton scored with like 2 seconds left!  It is really unbeleafable how bad this team is playing right now, they have a few half decent players, they shouldnt be this bad.  I think at some point you have to look to the coaching staff and start to ask the tough questions!"
524836,craigdritchie,2010-12-03 01:51:00,1586,Keep buying those jerseys and hats .......
524865,muddler,2010-12-03 02:43:00,623,"I agree with Dr. Salvelinus. He's pretty accurate. The Toronto media is also at fault here. They NEVER stop trying to fix a Toronto team. Virtually every sports team in Toronto gets way too much negative press. They (the press) always want to air lift a star to Toronto to ""fix"" the team. I read some of that in this thread too. What do you think the other teams are trying to do to improve thier teams? Give away their star player for nothing? The only way to get better is through the draft and gamble on your picks, then fill in some specialty spots (like a defensive specialist) later. Pressure to improve right away is the Leafs major downfall. Edmonton is doing it right. They are rebuilding and it will pay off in a couple years. It takes time for a team to jell and improve. In Toronto you always have a promise of a winner with the Leafs every fall. We know what happens every year.  Edmonto beat Toronto 5-0 today by the way. They must be doing something right.  Until the Toronto fans and media accept that it will take time to improve (assuming that the other teams aren't) nothing much will change. They will sell out the games and the die heart Toronto fans will keep cheering. The sweater and stuff will sell by the millions and the owners will make a lot of money. The media will all have those instant solutions and always someone to blame. I lived in Toronto for 33 years and I have heard this every year.  The Leafs just don't have the horses to run this race to the finish line. Accept it. Build for 5 years down the road. Look for a positive chage in the years to come not in the days to come. then they'll produce a winner and not a whiner.   muddler (Boston Fan)"
524866,jediangler,2010-12-03 02:48:00,1923,"Our Bruins looked good again tonight Muddler, 8-1 win over Tampa Bay."
524868,Guest Johnny Bass,2010-12-03 02:53:00,0," We need a Franchise player and Suguin for sure is not it. Give Kessel the right line mates and watch him go.  Seguin is not doin so great. 5 goals? Big deal. How many players in the NHL have 5 goals or more? Plus, like you said? Whose to say we would have picked Seguin? Even if seguin end up scoring 100 goals. Doesn't mean we would have picked them.  Maybe we should get the Detroit scouts.Either that or Detroit has a good steroids program. What do you think Stoty?  A team that seems to get all these average players that turn out to be stars? Strange hey?"
524869,anders,2010-12-03 03:07:00,1168," Really...wow....  You are comparing Kessel to a rookie that hasnt even played 30 games yet, and gets maybe 10min/game and plays on some nights with Scott Thornton....Really?  I garantee you, if Toronto had the second pick they would have picked Seguin...garanteed, if of course Edmonton didn't take him, and we all know they didn't.  You have to give the rookies time to adjust, grow and mature, which is something that looks like Toronto will not be seeing for sometime know, because, like most pro teams they build through the draft...just like Detroit!  Toronto is going to be euchered for some time,as they dont have the picks to build a team....muddler said it best!  Oh...and its looking like we are getting a top 3 pick again if this keeps up...GO B's!"
524872,Grimace,2010-12-03 03:42:00,2020,"You are off comparing Kessel to an eighteen year old in his first year. Kessel's first year he went 11 goals 18 assists for 29 points, all the time playing the wing with no defensive responsibilities.  Come on Mr Bass, get a grip. I know you can not blame Kessel for this trade. You can only evaluate him on what he has done compared to what he can do and he is falling short a tad with no line mates. No biggy. It is Burkes failure to evaluate talent and his team that has dug us into this hole."
524874,Grimace,2010-12-03 03:50:00,2020,Let's also not forget Knight who will be a fine NHLer. And of course next years first round pick.   This is a brutal time to be a Leafs fan.  You say you skipped the last few years watching Johnny?  I would wait a few more.
524126,Stoty,2010-12-01 02:39:00,2910,WOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOW!!!!
524128,Cudz,2010-12-01 02:43:00,2652,I almost expected that.  too bad
524131,Guest Johnny Bass,2010-12-01 02:48:00,0,"WOW! Is right. The leafs have been getting nothing but bad breaks......We deserved that win. I feel sorry for the monster. The guy is a good goalie. Shen is a great defensemen but offensively he sucks big time. He has to stop pretending to be a goal scorer.  Kulieman line seems to be the only line producing. Kuliemen has to be more disciplined. Drawing crappy penalties, and he has to watch that boarding.   I am still in disbelief. Its like the leafs are cursed......."
524132,Stoty,2010-12-01 02:49:00,2910,"It's true about the monster. Poor guy, man!"
524133,ontariofisherman,2010-12-01 02:52:00,52,"they suck, plain and simple"
524135,Stoty,2010-12-01 02:58:00,2910,"I was at the game on Friday night in Buffalo, and honestly, it was the WORST game I've ever seen an NHL team play in a very long time.  They couldn't score, hit, fight, shoot or even get the puck out of their own end! It was very sad!  Mr. Burke needs to make some HUGE moves..."
524136,lookinforwalleye,2010-12-01 02:59:00,4399,  I am in dis-be-leaf as well
524139,Guest Johnny Bass,2010-12-01 03:18:00,0," That was disgusting. Now I remember why I stopped watching the leafs for so many years. Reminds me of my luck on the river in poker I have been having lately!  That was definitely a coaching error. Not a team error.Putting Brown in the last minute of play was a smart move. He blocked two good shots. Its just bad luck!  I was cheering and then I said I better not jinx them. And they scored. My brother that stopped watching the leafs, finally watched tonight. And he was laughing, as he ran, really really fast, up the stairs.  Oh well. I still like our team, but there needs to be some changes for sure."
524142,Grimace,2010-12-01 03:33:00,2020,It comes down to this.  Does Brian Burke feel this team is good enough to make the playoffs?  He has said he does.  So that would mean he thinks they are not performong up to potential.  Meaning they are not being coached well.  Or  Does Brian Burke feel that the coach is doing the best he can with what he has to work with?  If so that would incriminate himself.   I am sick of hearing Burke talk out of both sides of his mouth.   I am also sick of our smug little coach.  I am sick of not having any draft picks.  I would have eagerly watched a rebuild.  Brian Burke is building a Stanley Cup champion.     In Boston.
524150,danc,2010-12-01 04:02:00,4677," He doesn't care. As long as you guys keep paying the bills and the result is a huge net profit, nothing will change. I quit watching hockey after the last strike. Don't miss it one bit."
524155,Bernie,2010-12-01 04:33:00,3190,With ya on that one Dan. I refuse to support a team that is there for only one reason....to make money....to heck with the fans.
524160,canadadude,2010-12-01 08:40:00,769,"If it wasn't for the Monster it would have been 10-3 .....like I said the Leafs are brutal,the goalie at least kept them in this one"
524177,Harrison,2010-12-01 12:30:00,2202,"I dunno Johnny, that 3rd goal was a pretty good break. Burke's a smart dude.  Making deals in haste or from media pressure is like being on ""tilt"" in poker. I am sure he wants to make a move but why go all in if you don't have to. From my past experience when a team isn't gelling, its usually the coaching team who are to blame.  Not only the head coach. Sometimes change is good."
524178,muskymatt,2010-12-01 12:32:00,2608,    Now that's funny
524185,craigdritchie,2010-12-01 13:16:00,1586,"Once again ... is this the sound of people jumping off a bandwagon that I hear?  I said it back at the beginning of the season, when the rest of the city was busy planning the parade route. The Loafs are awful, and as long as guys keep buying hats and jerseys and stupid car flags, pumping record profits into the team year after year, nothing will change."
524186,Guest gbfisher,2010-12-01 13:32:00,0,You all should know better by now eh?!?!
524190,bigbuck,2010-12-01 13:51:00,2449,"We will see what is going to happen if Rogers buys the Leafs. The Teachers aren't able to milk any more profits out of the team so they are losing interest. So for 1.3 billion samoleeans we may have a winning team in the next couple of years. I think this year may be another foregone conclusion. I however, remain faithful and hopeful that one day we may relive the glory days of the early '90s with Dougie Gilmour and Wendy Clark et al. where we actually had a chance at the cup."
524198,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2010-12-01 14:35:00,0,"Brian Burke has destroyed your franchise Leaf Nation and the true rebuild can't begin until him and Peddie are gone...  By trying to rush a rebuild into a year and a half rather than building through the draft for sustainable success like Chicago, Pittsburgh, and the Red Wings, Burke has insured that no matter how poorly the leafs do, they won't improve.  Part of being a GM these days is fiscal management.  The way you get a good deal on players?  Get'em young.  For example, Stamkos, the league's leading scorer is still on an entry level contract earning something like 3.5 million.  Sign him as a free agent this summer, and it will be like 7.  For those of you who defend the Kessel trade, JUST STOP IT !  IT WAS IRRESPONSIBLE AND HAS SET YOUR REBUILD BACK 2 YEARS!  The leafs now have ZERO depth at centre... do you know who is a centre?  Tyler Seguin...  Burke did nothing but ensure the sustainability of the Boston Bruins, likely making them a force in the east for at least the next 3 years.  Like everyone says, until Toronto fans stop blindly following the rebuild its not going to improve."

524232,Jds63,2010-12-01 15:56:00,1365,"  Ahhh yes 93 and 94 playoffs , we came close and the leafs should have won if not for Gretzky in 93 , we have made it to the playoffs 9 more years since then with 2004 our last , it really hurts to see them in the bottom of the league but we gotta keep the faith. Not sure if the Rogers deal will really change anything in their business model, after all TML is a money machine and will always be. Scouting and good management is the key, look at Detroit RW they rarely ever get great draft picks but they build great teams year after year with good scouting and great management decisions.  If TML can figure out the right pieces of the puzzle we will get all the Leaf defectors back again. It worked for Chicago now its our turn ... lets hope Burke can make it happen."
524234,Stoty,2010-12-01 16:11:00,2910,All this chaos....makes me proud to be a Wings fan!
524245,Guest Johnny Bass,2010-12-01 16:45:00,0," Chaos?  We're talking about hockey. Win or lose it doesn't change anything.  I think this team has potential. Get rid of Giguere, the monster to start,bring up the rookie goaltender, get some fresh coaching, teach our defensemen to be more disciplined a few trades and we're good.  Everyone is talking about rebuilding. What do you think Burke has done? We have the youngest team in the league.  Leafs have to get used to each other. The only line with chemistry now is the Kuleiman line. They need at least one more line. We are one center away from a decent team, and two guys away from a great team."
524255,Chance,2010-12-01 16:58:00,420,Those who are quick to dismiss the rebuild you take a look in the minors and see who the Leafs have drafted.All the bashers seem to draw back to the kessel deal as an indicator of a non rebuild.So lets say we kept those picks and Seguin is skating on our first line right now.Do we automatically make a run for the cup?Do we at least start winning games?No but there is hope for the future you say......Once again we are the youngest team in the league and look at who we HAVE drafted. Burke cleared out a mess of a team and has been rebuilding.
524256,addy79,2010-12-01 17:05:00,573,"I bet once Phaneuf is off the IR Burke will move Kaberle. Question remains, which centre will fit into our cap?"
524259,Grimace,2010-12-01 17:13:00,2020,I am a Leaf fan but you guys are dreamers.  Dr Sal hit it right on the head.
