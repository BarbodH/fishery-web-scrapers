525591,Canadave,2010-12-05 21:19:00,62," Hi DouG!!! How the hell are ya? Are you still Honeywelling?  Once in a long while I take a peek at what's happening on OFC but I started to post looking for input on a new fishfinder since my 9 year old Lowrance X85 bit the dust.  I stopped posting way back when, when some anal blowholes starting whining about rants and wanted to only talk about stupid fishing.  I mean get a life eh? Maybe sometime I'll do a rant about my two favourite topics these days ... global warming, the biggest scientific scam in history and that scumbag Hussein Obama, the biggest political con job on the American public let alone the world by the Democratic Party which isn't even the Democratic Party anymore since it was high-jacked by a bunch of extreme leftist radical revolutionary psychopaths."

Perhaps Jos @ Angling outfitters can offer you assistance, he is the number one Lowrance/Eagle dealer in Canukistan. Tell him you're budget.. he will work with you.

521463,perchslayer666,2010-11-19 13:55:00,280,"What the hell is Furuno? Never heard of it ever. When you incorporate the exchange, duty, and taxes you add another $60-$80 to the purchase price - if you want to buy new, make your purchase from a Canadian retailer, and buy a recognized brand that has a warranty, and customer service that is easily accessible. like Lowrance - my best customer service experience ever -  If that is still too much, buy used from Kajiji or Craigslist - time to time there are lots of good units for sale - lots of time until next season to look for one...."
521464,Canadave,2010-11-19 13:57:00,62,"Through the Furano site I found a place in Toronto called Radioworld that sells it for the same price and shipping through Canada Post is only $10.  The only difference then between Gander Mountain in Watertown NY is the exchange which is about 2% and our 13% HST vs whatever NY State taxes are which I think is about 7% for a difference of 5%.  If I end up getting this sucker I might as well get it here for maybe $20 more than in the U.S. with no hassles and customs headaches. UPS from the U.S. would likely wipe out that difference.  I didn't ask but warranty service might be better if I bought it here in Canada. If I decide on something else it looks like i can get it from Radioworld.  The guy I spoke to there was knowledgable and helpful and whatever they don't have in stock, they can order."
521465,Canadave,2010-11-19 14:06:00,62, CHANCHO ...All I know about Furuno is they're very common on large boats and yachts as well as commercial fishing boats in fresh and salt water which to me says a lot but I'll keep looking on the net for reviews and comparisons.  If I don't get one I'll likely go for a Lowrance or Humminbird. Rightly or wrongly commments I've been getting so far makes me a tad nervous about Garmin although they are the nicest looking ones.
521473,SmokestackLightnin,2010-11-19 14:43:00,390,Radioworld will look after you.
521489,4x4bassin,2010-11-19 16:14:00,1025,"Agree , Radio World is the place to go . Prices are usually the best there is and great service as well. I would go with a lowrance ! Good luck"
521490,Whopper,2010-11-19 16:18:00,2174,"Canadave, a lot of the bigger charters on Western Basin of Lake Erie use Furuno units and have for years."
521497,TennesseeGuy,2010-11-19 16:42:00,957,"COLOR IS IMPORTANT WHEN CHOOSING A SONAR.  Canadave, do you want it to match your black rod or would it better to match the red one?"
521754,Canadave,2010-11-20 15:05:00,62,"Geez Tennessee you've got a good memory, especially for an old fart.  Actually The Furunos are gray which would go quite smartly with my gray Stanfield gotchies that I've had for about 25 years now."

521756,Canadave,2010-11-20 15:08:00,62,Geez I must be getting old too.  I couldn't remember that I'd already hit the send button or whatever it's called.  I can't remember that either.
521915,adempsey,2010-11-21 09:58:00,1498,"Based on researching the web when I was looking around I got the impression that Furuno made some of the best electronics.   However, they didn't seem very common around here.  As mentioned above it's most likely due to them focusing on the marine market.  Anyway, there is also something to be said that most inland lake fishermen are not likely to own one.    So personally I'd do some in depth research before I went that route.  I'd also recommend Radioworld.   Good prices and service.  I love that store."
521997,Canadave,2010-11-21 17:43:00,62,I called Furuno in Washington State and they referred me to a boating website called www.thehulltruth.com.  I searched Furuno on the site and there were lots of testimonials about Furuno which were all superlative.  I couldn't find any negative comments whatsoever on Furuno but quite a few negatives on Garvin.  at this point I'm heading for Furuno but firsta I want tio find out if they display fish symbols in different sizes lioke my now dead X 65 Lowrance.  I hate those stupid archy things.
522024,John Bacon,2010-11-21 19:11:00,3277," If you see one of those ""stupid archy things"" on your fish finder you can be confident that it is a fish.  I have seen a graph display 6 or 7 fish symbols when the boat is tide to the dock in 3 feet of clear water without a fish in sight.  Not displaying the fish symbols is a plus in my opinion."
524609,Canadave,2010-12-02 16:38:00,62, It looks like I'll probably go with Lowrance or Humminbird since Furano doesn't have the fish symbols. I find it hard to believe that I could get used to those archy things especially since they (as far as I know) don't give a good representation of fish size.  Any redcommendations in the $200 to $300 range (plus a smidge if necessary)?
524646,johnnyb,2010-12-02 18:17:00,3413,"I always thought I'd like the fish symbols too....but after a short while, I much prefer operating with that feature turned off.  With only a few sizes of fish displayed on your screen....you don't get any idea of what you're looking at down there....but when you're in ""arch"" mode....you see a couple dots...you see a small line....you see a larger line....big fat arch....so much more variety and it gives you a better idea (I think) of what's going on ""down there"". I paid $169 USD for my Lowrance x67c....rigged it up in a nice little cooler bag to be a portable unit, and use it all year round.  Absolutely love it   Shipped it to some American relatives, and avoided any border shipping shenanigans."
524651,Guest gbfisher,2010-12-02 18:26:00,0,"  Turn the fish ID off!!! That way you will be able to tell the difference between bait, thermo clines, bubbles, weeds or floating junk. Yes bubbles will look like fish. Weeds will look like fish. Bait fish will look like a large pile of fish and so on. Even interference will lok like fish when there's nothing under you. You'll never be able to read what is really under you unless you have a better understanding of you should be looking for. So get a good finder and you will see what is what. Spend 500 and get maps as well."
524692,Canadave,2010-12-02 19:43:00,62, I spoke to a guy today at Angling Outfitters that Gerritt recommended.  He was obviously quite knowledgable and did a good selling job on the Lowrance Mark 5X for around $170 and the Mark 5X DSI for around $320 but may be worth the difference considering what it can do.
524696,Canadave,2010-12-02 19:47:00,62, gbfisher ... He also did a good job convincing me about all the disadvantages of fish symbols and that the images on the Lowrance Mark 5X DSI are even better than the symbols.
