524994,Eazy,2010-12-03 17:08:00,260,"I've got a few of these in my ice-box, but don't think they've ever hit the water, good customer reviews and such, but have a hard time trying something new when the old stand-bys are producing?"
524996,cram,2010-12-03 17:10:00,1733, What size/colours?   Want to sell them?
525011,Fish Farmer,2010-12-03 17:53:00,2234,"I had good luck with the small one at St. Williams for Perch. It's very light, OK for shallow water."
525045,Uncle Buck,2010-12-03 19:32:00,1000,i've thrown it in a bunch of times... never a sniff..
525091,Steel28,2010-12-03 21:41:00,160," same here..tried it on many lakes lol  cram, I might sell some"

525193,swiftability,2010-12-04 02:58:00,14,"I have couple, one is yellow perch and another one a little smaller colored as a shiner. They were doing pretty well on pike but it is true they are far not a first weapon I use  Jigging Rapalas are #1 for sure I'll give the perch Salmo another try tomorrow while jigging for walleye at BOQ."
525242,crappieperchhunter,2010-12-04 04:54:00,2582,"Watched a fellow fisherman ""Kill"" crappies through the ice on Scugog with Salmo,s 2 or 3 winters ago. Bought a few...but have never produced with them the way I do with my tried and true stuff"
525246,Eazy,2010-12-04 05:03:00,260," Hmm, maybe they'll be stayin' where they are.....funny the tackle you accumulate over the years and never actually use!"
525271,tjsa,2010-12-04 14:14:00,1578,"We have had success with them, Lakers love them along with stocked rainbows. Have caught walleye and stocked brook trout with them also. Mainly steel blue color with orange or chartreuse bellys and a little red color mixed in."
525348,EC1,2010-12-04 21:24:00,930,"Can someone explain how you work these things?  I have a Lindy Darter, and I've never gotten a single fish to hit these at all. I've had times where I fish were very interested according to the fishfinder, but they never seem to commit."
525351,trapshooter,2010-12-04 21:39:00,1234,"I use the Lindy Darter a lot for walleye and lake trout up here in NW Ontario.  Jigging should bring fish in.... they usually hit on the pause.  When I mark one on the flasher I'll hold still and wait for the hit.  Another technique to get hits is to slooowly raise the bait up, up and up trying to invoke a chase from the fish.  They are great for aggressive fish, more difficult to entice a strike from a neutral/negative fish.  Hard to beat live bait for those situations.  Bottom line is confidence.... get confidence and the bait spends a lot more time in the water and consequently catches more fish."
525361,OhioFisherman,2010-12-04 22:35:00,6623,"Can someone explain how you work these things? I have never used the Salmo, but the jigging rapala can produce even in the summer, a jigging action makes them swim in a circle, like a schooling baitfish . I have even caught catfish on them."
525387,kickingfrog,2010-12-05 00:19:00,8333,"The best advise I could give someone would be to get inside a hut on some clear water. I had a slow afternoon on simcoe a few years ago and pulled just about everything out of my ""icebox"". Watching how each bait reacted to my rod movements was invaluable.  I like the darter and so do the perch on softwater."
525399,buckster,2010-12-05 01:24:00,530,  Sounds like a fishing story to me Steve!  You cant even catch a cold with those things   If anyone wants to get rid of them send them over this way and i will make sure i destroy them asap
525405,tjsa,2010-12-05 01:40:00,1578,"Chubby Darters are jigged fast. Rip them up a couple of feet, then let them fall. You can feel them wiggle on the jig up, then they just go whatever direction on the fall, wiggling all the way. They do make a lot of ""noise"" in the water column."
525667,cram,2010-12-06 00:30:00,1733,what colours and sizes guys?

525847,johnnyb,2010-12-06 15:33:00,3413,"I never had much confidence in the chubby darter...tried it a few times...then got a Lindy Darter and bing bang boom I was catchin' fish!  They're very similar baits...so I'm sure confidence is the main difference for me.  But just do what Ben mentioned above....great for bringing fish in, and getting those aggressive ones out of the way quickly."
525856,cram,2010-12-06 15:52:00,1733, Curious - do the lindy and salmo lures have different action?  I know they have rattles but otherwise thought they were exactly the same.  (and quite a knock-off job)
