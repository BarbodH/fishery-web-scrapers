525288,ccmtcanada,2010-12-04 16:32:00,7971,"After all the rains early this week, I knew I had to make some time to fish a local creek or two.  Water is still up about 8"" more than normal, and running fast.  It was stained a bit more than I hoped, but there was about 10"" of visibility.  It was chilly out....about -5C when I hit creekside.   When the sun began to come up over the trees, the fish started biting!  As expected, there were lots of people out, and all my favourite spots were taken, so I concentrated on lead in and tail outs that are normally too shallow for me to fish, but had a little depth because of the water levels.  I caught a few smaller steelhead early on....about this size...   I kept close to my favourite spot...and when it finally vacated, I headed over to it.  First cast...the wind took it and I had a tangle that was too much to even think about trying to deal with, so I cut the line and had to rig all over again.  The waters looked great here....and as my fingers began to get numb, I was finally able to drift again.  It didn't take long....my float went down hard...set the hook and I see the boil...and white belly of a nice steelie!  About 15 minutes later it goes down again, this time the fish is hooked nicely!  I felt the weight and it was a nice sized fish!  I thought it strange that it wasn't fighting all that hard, until I saw it as it got close.  I got a nice female brown!   A few quick pics and back into the creek she went!     Not bad for a few hours out on a chilly Saturday morning....I think I'll be out again tomorrow morning!!!"
