525511,Keenan,2010-12-05 15:35:00,59,"Wondering if some of you can tell me a spot or two where I can walk out on simcoe for some lake trout and white fish, not looking for spots just where to get on the lake from shore, any help would be great. Thanks"
525519,Dondorfish,2010-12-05 16:06:00,1000,Innisfil Beach Road - from the park at the end. Walk out to around the 70 - 80 foot mark - or look for the crowds! lol   Tracker ( Don )
525520,Spiel,2010-12-05 16:08:00,9065,"The shortest walk to deep water on Simcoe is from the west side, look for access points anywhere from the north end of Cooks Bay northward to Oro Station. Innisfil would be a good place to start."
525521,Dondorfish,2010-12-05 16:08:00,1000,Just noticed that you were from Lindsay area - probably the closest to you would be Beaverton area - but its a long long walk.   Tracker ( Don )
525527,Keenan,2010-12-05 16:18:00,59," I started fishing simcoe last year and walked out from beaverton. All i could catch was perch I walked out to the island, it took forever."
525529,Dondorfish,2010-12-05 16:23:00,1000, You have to go out past the island to get to the laker/whitie waters - as was mentioned above - you would probably be better off heading to the west side of the lake - alot less walking.  Tracker ( Don ) - we head out from LeFroy or Innisfil as mentioned
525531,Keenan,2010-12-05 16:26:00,59," Well thanks for the info, I'll have to try heading out from Innisfil."
525534,misfish,2010-12-05 16:37:00,29133,"Once the ice is good and safe,you can drive to the grounds(there will be a road out.LOL.Just look for the large group.Wont be hard to find.  On this side, walking out to deep water is not hard.5 minute walk out and yer in 70-100 fow."
525561,Swan_Dive,2010-12-05 17:55:00,46," So now that it is finally getting a little colder out, when do you think the ice is going to be strong enough to venture out?  Iam not talking first crazies on the ice but safe enough where your mom would let you walk out there without freaking out?"
525566,Terry,2010-12-05 18:20:00,14456,"Jan 16, 2 thousand and never  my mother wouldn't go on the ice even if it was 8ft thick"
525567,misfish,2010-12-05 18:22:00,29133,Jan 15th
525577,Keenan,2010-12-05 20:02:00,59," If we get as much snow this year as they are calling for, driving my car out won't be an option lol, I drive a 2008 Chevy Aveo lol."
525676,Keenan,2010-12-06 00:43:00,59,Say theres 5 or 6 inches on scugog before december 15 when bass and muskie close. Can you still ice fish for those species?
525684,irishfield,2010-12-06 00:54:00,26272,Yes... there is nothing that says you have to be in a boat.
525693,Keenan,2010-12-06 01:01:00,59," Perfect, just making sure, it's starting to freeze up pretty good out there.   Hope the pictures work."
