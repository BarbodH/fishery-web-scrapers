828611,pidge,2014-01-05 07:25:00,438,Can't wait to get out for some Simcoe fishing. Got a date booked for the 16th and 17th. I'm going to use my brand new never used new to me fish finder and rig an arm or something for the transducer. For the the guys and gals that use there finder on the ice do you submerge the transducer down the hole until its completely under the ice and if so by how much?  Pidge
828612,mike rousseau,2014-01-05 07:56:00,4661,The transducer just needs to get to the bottom of the ice..
