I was trying to show a local boy how to drill holes, and unfortunately he gave the cord a tug, lost his grip and dropped it.  The switch broke maybe a 1/4"", just to where it is a pain to turn the machine on, especially with gloves. What our your expert thoughts on repairing this? My first idea was very ""redkneck"" lol, gorilla glue a key to the switch for an easy solution. Problem is, if i break that heaven forbid, itll break the switch right off more than likely ill be left with a bigger problem. Second thought was remove the cover, drill a small hole through the switch, then tie some wire to it to pull up or down. I think this way might reduce the chance of further damage??? Thoughts? Its an eskimo 52"" shark btw, and it was purchased used, no warranty"
829394,aplumma,2014-01-09 00:30:00,6896,Without a picture here is my idea. Drill a hole into the switch and put a piece of 1/8 inch brass dowel in it and glue it with a 2 part epoxy. Keep the dowel just long enough to flip with your gloves on.   Art
829395,irishfield,2014-01-09 00:31:00,26272,Piece of mechanics wire... form one end round..  the other end tweek into a slight wave. Heat red and melt it into the existing switch. Let cool and add some Krazy glue around the wire.

I have one of the CT rebranded Makos and it broke before I even got to use it!!! Way too much plastic on those augers.  Anyway, I called customer service and told them the issue and they immediately sent me 2 replacements in case I had another problem. Good customer service from them.  http://www.ardisam.com/contactUs/  If I remember correctly the lady you want to talk to is Eva."
829414,bare foot wader,2014-01-09 01:37:00,1354,"like I just posted on another thread (and probably spammed some other threads a while back) ardisam has great customer service....service like that deserves recognition, they shipped express to me and even followed up with a voicemail to make sure I received and had no troubles installing  hard to beat service like that, I'd try calling them but in the short term just use pliers to adjust the switch  or you could just trim the plastic cover to allow easier finger access too?"
829513,manitoubass2,2014-01-09 17:16:00,11391,Thanks for the help guys! Ill let ya know how it turns out
829530,Headhunter,2014-01-09 20:04:00,5703,"If it's the plastic choke switch you are talking about, I feel your pain! At some point last year, mine snapped of as well. Fortunately there is just enough of the lever left, that I can move it with gloves on, but it's still a pain in the rear! Good luck and do let us know how it worked out. HH"
