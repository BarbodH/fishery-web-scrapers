829401,Handlebarz,2014-01-09 00:53:00,3790,Is anyone else going to the Musky Sunday at the Spring Fishing show in Toronto on Feb 16th?  Muskies Canada is hosting it again this year I am going along with my wife I know a lot of musky guys are going just wondering if anyone from the OFC family will be there? it was on the Monday of this show years back but it has been switched to Sunday again which is great.  I will have freebees for the first 100-200 people through the door Sunday morning. We (my wife and I) don't have a booth and are not selling anything just volunteering our time to MCI for a few hours and then checking out the show for the afternoon.  Come out and talk musky to help pass along the winternet blues.  I don't have all the details but will post them when I know what the times are
