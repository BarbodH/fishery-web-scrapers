828339,Sandbag,2014-01-03 21:44:00,533,Thx tb4me  Good News  Cheers  Craig
828355,mistaredone,2014-01-03 23:19:00,913,Thanks!  I'll look them up
828421,Rich,2014-01-04 10:11:00,3927,"Spots are pushing 10"" now and the least i've heard of anyone finding is 6""... The huts are out today! Finally we're getting a full season (knock on wood) of ice on the bay!!"
828430,Renegade67,2014-01-04 13:34:00,86,Never ice fished Erie..would the operators be on perch grounds?  Maybe walleye?
828431,F7Firecat,2014-01-04 13:39:00,347,"Perch grounds and some pike, walleye are far off from Long Point Bay unfortunately."
828447,Rich,2014-01-04 16:11:00,3927,"I'm surprised you never hear of the odd walleye caught through the ice there. The bay is pretty much all perch grounds end to end though, similar to cooks but shallower."
828451,pics,2014-01-04 16:27:00,1268,It's like fishing in an aquarium when the water clears. You can travel for miles and never get deeper than 6 feet of water. And I've never seen a wormy perch out of there..
828492,ch312,2014-01-04 19:05:00,1590,"It's like fishing in an aquarium when the water clears. You can travel for miles and never get deeper than 6 feet of water. And I've never seen a wormy perch out of there..  It's awesome sight fishing for the perch, especially when the pike come to play. But, I've had the best luck catching pike when the water was murky with 2ft or less visibility.  I've been on LPB a few times where the ice was crystal clear with just the odd drift of snow so you could see the bottom and fish cruising around. Very cool, but it's definitely a weird sensation walking on snow and then stepping onto what appears to be water."
828510,SBCregal,2014-01-04 19:29:00,688,"Are there people out on atvs/sleds?  I'M hoping to get out there either tomorrow or wednesday.  Made the trip down there 3 times last year only to find no fishable ice, can't wait to get out there.  Ryan"
828512,Steve,2014-01-04 19:36:00,2075,"it'll be interesting to see the size caught.  most of erie perch are now caught in 40' - 60' of water...including in the winter.  lpb's perch have seen major declines (as with their bass).  however, not much ice fishing has gone on in the last four or five years due to warm winters.  lets see if any remotely close to jumbo's are caught this year."
828515,danbouck,2014-01-04 19:53:00,4380, lets see if any remotely close to jumbo's are caught this year.  there have been some already caught and there will be a ton more
828516,Steve,2014-01-04 19:56:00,2075,"lets hope so.  i was at the local tackle shop today and a group of four anglers returned from lpb.  they brought back approx 75 perch, but the biggest was only 9"".  average was 7""."

828676,Steve,2014-01-05 18:28:00,2075,some folks want a perch dinner - no matter the size (i guess).  i hope the fishing is good in lpb.  it helps the minnow sales in Hamilton here.
828769,Rich,2014-01-06 00:41:00,3927,"It's always been hit and miss. You can and often do hit perch anywhere, but big ones take more searching. When you find them, they're usually all in one group in one little area. I'm content looking down one hole all day and hoping they'll come to me. Lol"
