828988,super dave,2014-01-07 15:03:00,323,Well I tried lake Simcoe last week with the help of some members advice. It was a fun time even though the fishing was pretty slow.  2 perch in the dying minutes saved the day from a skunking. But I think Im hooked.  I was thinking of hitting Scugog this weekend since I’ll be in Lindsay visiting the inlaws.  I found a township of scugog for parking spots but none for the east side.   Does anyone know if there is access on the east side of the lake?  Any tips would be appreciated.  I’ll be taking my nephews again so size doesn’t really matter.  Thanks in advance.
