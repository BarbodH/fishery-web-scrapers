I hadn't been back home in a decade or more and was looking forward to getting into some of theseTasty sea insects.We timed it perfectly for the opening of recreational cod fishing opener  If i had to guess that giant cod was around 75 LBS. I really have no idea. It was the biggest anyone had ever seen, except in photographs from like the 50's or whatever. It was talked about on the cbc radio while we were there by some old timers who thought the fishery was so good that the season should be all summer as evidenced by that giant cod caught up by bay of exploits. It was even in the newspaper. As a reference, the next biggest one which I'm holding is a big fish. Its looks like a minnow in comparison."
827621,highdrifter,2013-12-31 14:29:00,2534,Wow what a fish!!!  Looks like the fishery is on the rebound..    Is the commercial fishery still closed?  Very cool!  cheers HD
827622,frodobuggins,2013-12-31 14:36:00,127,"As far as i know there is a commercial ground fish season, but not per say for cod. They open up cod a couple times a year for rod and reel angling and i think limit of 5 per person. (don't quote me) Ocean fishing is awesome. You literally, at times, have no clue about what your about to reel up."

827626,frodobuggins,2013-12-31 14:45:00,127,"HUGE fish, musta been quite a tussle getting that big boy into the boat !!  I wish i could say i caught it but it was my mother in law. It took like 15 minutes and we were convinced it was some massive flat fish because she was struggling so bad.  When it broke the surface we all laughed so hard because it was so unimaginable that this could be real. And it was 5 minutes into the first day of fishing the opener"
827646,Rich Clemens,2013-12-31 16:05:00,3131,Awesome.   Thanks for sharing.
827652,Sinker,2013-12-31 16:14:00,8692,"Wow.....ive seen millions and millions of codfish, but never one that big!!! WOW!!!  Ive seen 50lbers a few times, but good lord, that thing is massive!!  My old man was saying that the fall rec. Fishery this year had the biggest fish he'd seen since he was a kid, and lots of them. I know when I was there 2 summers ago, we'd have one every drop, and sometimes your jig wouldnt hit bottom.  You're right about the limit. 5 per person. Maximum 15 per boat per day. No possesion limit.  The best fish in the world right there!  Thanks for the report!!  S."
827658,frodobuggins,2013-12-31 16:27:00,127, The trip reports are my favourite part of this board so I thought I would add something a little different.
828058,pidge,2014-01-02 01:06:00,438,"That's a pretty sweet sized cod your mom in law caught there wow. Looks like you had a feast there to boot which is always nice. I have fond memory's of fishing there as a kid catching Tom cod, flat fish, trout and the odd eel. Where abouts were the pics taken? My mother is from Carbonear and dads from the opposite side. St.Georges area."

828068,captpierre,2014-01-02 02:16:00,2521,"Any attempt at Atlantics in the rivers?  I tried it near Cornerbrook about 10 yrs ago but no luck.  Have to hire a licensed guide and barbless fly fishing only  Best bet is Labrador, I hear  peter"
828133,frodobuggins,2014-01-02 18:55:00,127,"I haven't fished for Atlantics for at least  20 yrs.  We grew up around Lewisporte and that's where these pics are from. Lots of ""trouting"" to do as well. When we used to fish them you are right, fly rod only."
828208,Sinker,2014-01-03 02:32:00,8692,"Some pretty good atlantic fishing on the island, but same as any river fishing, timing is everything. When I was home 2 summers ago, it was pretty much a drought, and the salmon were stale, and real hard to catch, so I didnt waste my time. Id rather fish the saltwater anyways. Sounds like you and I were there at the same time frodo. I was there for the rec fishery in 2012. Beautiful weather the whole time, and tons of fish!  S."
828215,limeyangler,2014-01-03 02:46:00,5204,NICE! Love sea fishing.
828219,Moosebunk,2014-01-03 03:26:00,3970,OMC... Oh My Cod!!! lol.  Cool pics Frodo of the Shire!
828438,spinnerdoc,2014-01-04 14:56:00,556,Thats a heck of a codfish. One of our suppliers built a house the and he just flies baxk and forth....now I know why he loves being back.
