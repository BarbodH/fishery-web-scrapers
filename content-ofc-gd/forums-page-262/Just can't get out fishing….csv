828601,limeyangler,2014-01-05 03:47:00,5204,"Hi all,  Had it all planned. Was going to go trout fishing today. Only one chore to do, easy….front porch area needed snow blowing…then gone!  Hmmmmmm, what i forgot was that the guy who plows our yard after heavy snow IS ON HOLIDAY  3 hours later at 1pm i'm just about done with the snow removal, only problem is the wind is up to around 25kmh and temps have dipped to minus 20c and dropping.  Seems to be the pattern here this year, gets warm enough to snow then too cold to go out and play in it. Well i was not going to let that stop me. With fishing off the radar (again) I took the opportunity to clear out the garage…then jumped on the snow machine for an evening stroll round the block.    "

I had drifts today well over 20"" and man o man, what i had to shovel by hand was tough. I went and checked the ice after work today, 30-35""!!!!! Howah!  Might need an extension this year lol. Forecast is looking BRUTALLy cold till next friday:(. GNARLY"

It's either record setting cold, or mild and snowing. I remember the entire month of January waking up to -20f and lower temps. Welcome to the north my friend."
