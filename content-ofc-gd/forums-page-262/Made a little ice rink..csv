826735,limeyangler,2013-12-26 14:03:00,5204,"Made a little ice rink out front yesterday, mum and kid helped, hope to try it out today.  "
826741,Roy,2013-12-26 14:36:00,13728,"Absolutely beautiful, Simon. Jack is blessed to have you both as parents."
826742,Snowball,2013-12-26 14:40:00,167,"You and your family will certainly get a lot of enjoyment out of your rink. When my brothers and I were young, every winter we build an ice rink in the back yard. Enjoyed every minute of the rink except the snow shovelling. We used to get many times the snow we do now and they had not invented snow blowers yet. Enjoy the rink!  Regards, Snowball"
826743,danc,2013-12-26 14:45:00,4677,Little? Looks like the world jrs. could be playing on there. Great job Simon.
826744,frodobuggins,2013-12-26 15:00:00,127,Amazing! is this where you live or a cottage? Seems like a good life either way
826748,kickingfrog,2013-12-26 15:13:00,8333,"OK, so now you start looking on ebay for a slightly used zamboni and then a kit to paint the ice.  We'll have to have a OFC shinny game… shirts versus skins is how we do it here you know eh."
826749,Handlebarz,2013-12-26 15:13:00,3790,Awesome you have a great life up there thanks for sharing with us
826754,Nipfisher,2013-12-26 15:29:00,2449,All that in 3 and a half minutes? Man you work fast Simon. LOL Great job. We have one in our back yard but it is a kit from Canadian Tire. It is called EZ Rink if anyone is interested.
826755,limeyangler,2013-12-26 15:47:00,5204,Not a bad job eh? If the OFC game happens i'm wimping out and want to play on 'shirts' team…..lol. Its gonna be touch and go whether jack wants to skate as he was put off when he took a tumble on a smaller one i made with him a week ago. He seemed a little more enthusiastic when i said I would lace up my skates….so we will see.
826758,kickingfrog,2013-12-26 16:03:00,8333,Nothin' wrong with boot hockey on ice.
826760,limeyangler,2013-12-26 16:13:00,5204,Nothin' wrong with boot hockey on ice.  Brilliant! I need to 'think outside the rink' like that.
826782,fish_fishburn,2013-12-26 19:42:00,1311,let the young lad push a chair when he is skating. After a few days he will be leaving the chair behind.
826789,irishfield,2013-12-26 20:11:00,26272,Man Simon.. the wife is gonna be tired after sweeping that off every day !!
826798,limeyangler,2013-12-26 22:25:00,5204,let the young lad push a chair when he is skating. After a few days he will be leaving the chair behind.  Yeah…we have tried that…he spooked himself pretty good and does not want to know for the moment…but knowing jack he'll be back on the horse soon enough.
828063,atvaholic,2014-01-02 01:54:00,271,Great idea using the auger to flood! I remember learning to play hockey on a pond by my house...some great memories...and every new years we would rent a cottage on pigeon lake and used to play our own winter classic.
828066,leaf4,2014-01-02 02:03:00,2466,"I intend to do something similar for some weekend pond hockey up in haliburton except with a sump pump up at a buddies cottage, not sure if he has an auger cause that seemed to be pretty effective"
828067,kickingfrog,2014-01-02 02:13:00,8333,Try it with a hand auger. Just make sure the 9 and the 1 are already dialled.
828108,Jds63,2014-01-02 15:09:00,1365,Great stuff Simon !
828176,limeyangler,2014-01-02 23:59:00,5204,"Still have to try it out, it got cold enough to snow….dumped a foot then went back to minus -30s again"
828892,johnnybo1,2014-01-06 23:12:00,42,I always wanted one of these in my backyard but I grew up in the city and there was no room. Great video your kids gonna love it!
828923,bigugli,2014-01-07 02:35:00,6138,"Loved pond hockey. The neighbour would come out with his tractor to plow us a rink every winter, and occasionally  drag out his PTO pump to flood the rink. Sad to think I can't even stand up on a pair of skates any more."

Sad to think I can't even stand up on a pair of skates any more.   I played a game called bandy when we lived in Sweden…its like a cross between european field hockey and ice hockey, played on a rink the size of a soccer field….now that took some flooding. Awesome game by the way….also play with a ball not a puck.   "
