828267,super dave,2014-01-03 15:29:00,323,"Hey Guys.  I think I might give ice fishing for perch on simcoe a go.  I've never been and want to take my two nephews out for a couple of hours.  I just don't know where to park.  Looking at google maps, looks like a lot of private property.  I'm in pickering so the south east end is where I'll probably go.  Not looking for hotspots, but can someone let me know where I can park in the virginia beach, pefferlaw, or jackson's point area and not pi$$ anyone off?  If you got tips, I welcome those as well.  Doesn't worms work for perch in the winter?  They def. do in the summer.  Thanks a lot in advance."
828269,Christopheraaron,2014-01-03 15:38:00,3525,"End of Hadden Rd, takes you straight out to virginia. Worms will work but minnows, simcoe bugs and marabou jigs are best IMO."

828286,adempsey,2014-01-03 17:02:00,1498,"Plenty of parking on the streets near Gilford.  It's also a very busy entry point, so you need to plan to get there early or late if you don't want to walk too far.  http://www.iceshanty.com/ice_fishing/index.php?topic=215919.0.  I haven't been there in a couple of seasons, so make sure to pay attention to the NO parking signs because the townships around Simcoe love to change things that aren't usually in the favor of people going ice fishing.  Other access points with some parking information can be found on this map:  http://www.timeonthewater.ca/simcoe_winter_access.html"
828297,super dave,2014-01-03 17:54:00,323,thanks everyone!!
828311,Acountdeleted,2014-01-03 19:56:00,2562,"Best thing to do in Gilford IMO is if you are with a buddy or if your kids are old enough, drop them off at the boat launch with the gear, park the car and walk back. Then when you pick them up, go get the car first while they wait with the gear. Saves a lot of time and sore legs (I run marathons so the extra walking is good for me)"

828984,super dave,2014-01-07 14:52:00,323,"i ended up at virginia beach mainly because it was the closest to my house.  I was a tough day, only 2 perch and it didn't seem like anyone else was catching.  But a great experience non the less.  Thanks again for the help everyone."
828986,BillM,2014-01-07 14:54:00,17367,"If you're not getting into the fish, make sure you move around until you find them."
828994,super dave,2014-01-07 15:16:00,323,hey bill.  did that.  we moved about 4 times spending about 10-20 minutes at each spot.  I guess it was just a bad day?  or I don't even have skills to fool a perch.
829003,Headhunter,2014-01-07 15:45:00,5703,"What were you using as bait? How deep were you fishing. Those silly perch can be a pain to find, but trying 10-15ft of water, then moving deeper if they are not there is a good starting point. Jiggin Raps tipped with power grubs always work on those little brats! HH"
829004,super dave,2014-01-07 15:53:00,323,i just used a jig head with a small live minnow.  I was in about 12 feet.  started at around 8-10.

I guess it was just a bad day?  or I don't even have skills to fool a perch.  It happens.  What I like for perch are those small Rapala jiggin raps with a few wax worms on the bottom treble hook.    Might wanna give that a shot next time, works great for crappie as well (or any pan fish)"
829015,Christopheraaron,2014-01-07 16:26:00,3525,Might want to try moving more often. If using a hut drill until you find fish then pitch it.
829107,davey buoy,2014-01-07 21:57:00,5505,"I fish far deeper waters,and it always takes about 20 mins or so with minnows,usually 3-4 guys,then all hell breaks loose.From the time they get a sniff,and call the their friends it's a frenzy.Even hooked into lakers with larger 4"" minnows to try and get away from those pesky  perch. lol."
