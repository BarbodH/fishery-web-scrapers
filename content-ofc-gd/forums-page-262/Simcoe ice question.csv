Just wondering if anyone has any input on what rain can do to the ice. Should I stay home? Thanks"

829431,Joeytier,2014-01-09 02:43:00,3990,"Wont do much to the ice, but conditions will be awesome once things firm back up.  I wish we were getting some of that up here.  We need a good thaw to knock down the slush"
829450,Sinker,2014-01-09 04:31:00,8692,The ice will be fine. It will just be wet. This is just what we need. It will only make it better once it firms back up.  S.
829452,irishfield,2014-01-09 04:34:00,26272,Rain won't do anything to the ice.. just pray it REALLY REALLY rains! We could use at least 10 days of rain and then -40c up North. Wife and I just about left my 500 Skidoo as lake structure on Sunday. 2 miles with throttle pegged to the bar to find high ground to stop and fish.. same thing back with slush banging off the back of her head rebounding off the hut behind us.
