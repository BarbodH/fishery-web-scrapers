Once you get the debt controlled you can budget painless fun money and not feel guilty.    Art"
827291,Loonietoon,2013-12-30 01:24:00,1450,It is definatly a go for sure hope to see all there cheap drinks and good food at a reasonable price supporting our veterans for sure.  Iron maker we won't keep you up to late we promise

827553,Loonietoon,2013-12-31 02:19:00,1450,That will be good Bruce.. now where is Albert
827563,HTHM,2013-12-31 03:31:00,4082,About 2.5 kms away from where the GTG is going to be.
827852,Loonietoon,2014-01-01 01:49:00,1450,good you might just beat me there or maybe not we will see
828065,Loonietoon,2014-01-02 02:03:00,1450,Is this all we are going to have What about Fish Farmer and some of the newbies Johnybot a chance to meet others from the area come on where is every one that says we do not do anything
828071,HTHM,2014-01-02 03:15:00,4082,Is this all we are going to have What about Fish Farmer and some of the newbies Johnybot a chance to meet others from the area come on where is every one that says we do not do anything Think back ~4 - 5 years ago Kelvin. At least you and I had fun.
828076,Loonietoon,2014-01-02 03:34:00,1450,This is so true Albert and then they say we don't do any thing But like you said We had fun with the waitresses keeping her busy
828122,bass_man,2014-01-02 17:57:00,43,If newbies are OK I'd like to come. I'm working in Toronto tomorrow and its on my way back to Brantford.  Jim

828130,Roy,2014-01-02 18:42:00,13728,I wish more people would join in..especially newer members.  It's what makes the community strong. It'll be a fun time for sure. I've thought about it but I'm pushin' 70 and it's a 1300 KLM return trip for me so I guess I'll miss this one. Have a great time guys. Glad you're doing this.
828136,lew,2014-01-02 19:35:00,12766,For anyone who's never been to a GTG your missing alot of fun and the chance to meet some great folks. If your close to Hamilton it'd definitely be worth your while to join in.  We used to do them quite a bit years ago but they seem to have petered out for some reason.  If I was 100 odd miles closer I'd be going for sure.  
828142,Steve,2014-01-02 20:24:00,2075,so tomorrow night eh.  hmmm.....
828151,HTHM,2014-01-02 21:39:00,4082,"Free pool, the best wings in Mount Hope, and the place is friendly. Except for me that is..."
