828813,myot,2014-01-06 14:12:00,131,"The game against the Fins was plain and simply a poorly coached game by Sutter when you are 3"" taller and 25lbs heavier then each player you might not want to into a speed game and no matter how the refs are calling the game good clean body checks still make a point  even if you get a minor penalty for it  Dan"
828816,jedimaster,2014-01-06 14:52:00,3472,A lot of people were critical of the team that was put together from the very beginning. Lots of great players were left off the roster. Its unfortunate.

828722,woodenboater,2014-01-05 20:38:00,2277,"This is a Globe and Mail piece (from November) that talks about this exact issue facing hockey in Canada. Never played competitive hockey as there was no way my parents could afford it back then (70's), heck, I didn't even go to summer camp either (I know, boo hoo).  http://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/national/time-to-lead/the-great-offside-how-canadian-hockey-is-becoming-a-game-strictly-for-the-rich/article15349723/#dashboard/follows/  There are probably a bunch of Gretzkys or Crosbys out there but they're not in leagues so likely going un-noticed.  I'm not too fussed about importing players. If we promoted skills vs toughness, we'd see more home growns imo."
828723,DRIFTER_016,2014-01-05 20:47:00,10439,WOW!!! Nice game by Finland.
828724,jbailey,2014-01-05 20:49:00,866,"Rep hockey is far too expensive and it forces some kids who have the talent to play at higher levels to play in house league. All kids are different and some prefer the competitive nature of rep hockey and have no interest in playing in lower levels. It can be very frustrating for some. This problem is being addressed by some, such as Subban and his organization to help under privileged children. House league hockey isn't even cheap anymore, not too mention all the equipment."

Very proud right now.  (still would have been MUCH MORE PROUD if it was Canada - let me keep that clear. I am Canadian)  But man, this is huge for Finland.  It would be like us beating the States, in the States.  Big stuff in Finland right now. Great job boys."
828728,manitoubass2,2014-01-05 20:57:00,11391,"Its a funny topic. I think its alot of things that need to add up for kids to take it to a superior level. Some children our groomed and have influential mentors supporting them and i think thats a weird thing.  I played with some wicked good hockey players, someof them never made it anywere. One has a stanley cup(duncan keith). No ifea whatever happened to duncans older brother but at that level he was FAR above duncan skill wise. There was one other guy i thought wouldbe the next gretsky for sure, scored like ten goals game playing 10-15 minutes a game. He was benched most the time cause anytime he had a shift he scored numerous times, and no kid could even touch him. He went to college and i never heard his name again??? Maybe he discovered fishing lol. Maybe an idea would be to eliminate rep teams in the early years. Players in house league would certainly benefit playing better opponents???? Hockey is expensive these days and that doesnt help. Also it ""seems"" parents arent as involved as generations ago. My grampa did stuff for us kids i dont really see or here of today. Flooding a rink in the bush for shinny(sounds retarded but playing hockey in the bush is wicked fun), he also got the arena operator to open the rink for us at 5-6am on friday saturday and sunday. We would play for the whole morning. Anyhow, book written, point of it? Im not sure haha"
828729,misfish,2014-01-05 21:02:00,29133,"  Oh stop that.  If Newfoundland would of had a team,I be as proud as a peacock."
828731,Steve,2014-01-05 21:09:00,2075,"if your kid is THAT good, but you cannot afford double A or triple A, you have to at least get your kid in A hockey. That will be enough to build skills so when they get to major peewee or minor bantam, you can then have them try out for the AA or AAA teams.  At that age they'll get scouted enough to get drafted (if good enough).  As parents you only had to shell out coin for one or two years of AA / AAA hockey.  In Hamilton we have only had a few kids make it to the big leagues lately....all three of them played A level (used to be called Hub Hockey in Hamilton) until they were PeeWee, or minor Bantom in one case.  You don't need to play AA / AAA all your years to make it to the big house."
828732,Steve,2014-01-05 21:11:00,2075,"Brian, I just want to be clear that my first team, every time, is Canada.  We have this little battle in our household for every international event.  My mother always cheers for Finland, while my dad, myself, and my brother cheer for Canada.  I've always been clear with my family that Canada comes first.  But second will always be Finland.  (I'm fifth generation Canadian on dad's side. German background there)"

828739,Pickeral eater,2014-01-05 21:36:00,155,Unfortunately our boys just haven't been able to grow as the rest of the world.   At one point in time we were the team to beat but now we are just as good as the Europeans.  Lets face it we have great hockey players but our years of sending big strong teams are coming to the end. Hockey Canada needs to start to develops a faster skill based team.  I love our juniors but the world is catching up!!!! Be safe Bill  Ps good on the Finns!! They deserved it this year
828742,woodenboater,2014-01-05 21:58:00,2277,"the NHL should have mandated larger ice when rinks were being rebuilt. But no, they would lose space for the club boxesâ€¦this is why NA will always have a difficult time in international tournaments overseas."
828667,muskymatt,2014-01-05 18:14:00,2608,"So the Canadian Juniors fell to disgrace again.Here's my take on why!Minor hockey is too expensive in Canada and only the well off can afford to put their kids in it. This is eliminating a huge population from ever being able to have a chance. This gets worse with the higher level the kid plays, I know, I've had 2 in competitive for years and now my youngest is playing Midget AA (the highest level she can play) and the fees are insane. When a family has to pay in excess of $10,000 and as much as $15,000 for 2 kids to play hockey, that fact alone rules hockey for many families. Bring down the cost and have more government programs for the kids, other countries do this and it works.Stop opening the door to out of country players for Junior hockey, period! It's taking spots and development away from Canadian kids. Let alone the money put out to bring these kids over. Developing foreign players to compete against you????? In war time, this would be treason!!Sutter did it wrong. By only bringing 26 kids to camp and cutting 2, essentially they told the kids you don't have to compete for this position. So the silver spoon, rich parent kids got coddled again. No compete attitude was instilled in them for this tournament. Sad!Smarten up Canada! We have been losing for too long!"
828668,BillM,2014-01-05 18:18:00,17367,"Disgrace?  Wow man, really?   They lost, big deal.   You're not one of those fans that expects them to win all the time, every time are you?"

828670,misfish,2014-01-05 18:21:00,29133,"All I can ad to that is,,  Not all great hockey players play rep hockey. There are some real good players in the house league level. It,s due to like you said. COST to the parents..  Im glad my paying days are behind me. Two was hard. When the youngest dropped out,the oldest one went on to play double /triple A. til midget.  Ya,a goalie of all things."
828671,tb4me,2014-01-05 18:23:00,3295,"Ha ha ha I have to agree with Matt to some extent..Its far too expense but disgrace.. nah....That game against the Fins was a disgrace, The Refs called very lousy penalties to favor the Fins and in turn cost us 2 early goals. I clearly seen the boys in Red and White gave up, I honestly dont blame them..How the heck do you play a system that's all about diving and dirty play.. we cant compete with that and thank god were Canadians and refuse..I honestly think its time for a coaching change and new management as well.. Till next year Go Canada Go!"

828674,Steve,2014-01-05 18:26:00,2075,"what is the split of players that are currently in the NHL, that were eligible for the juniors?  were the majority Canadian?  a split?  that's what I'm curious about.  I mean if all the teams had players in the NHL, then its more even. But if it was a vast majority of Canadians that stayed in the NHL, instead of playing junior, then that could really swing things."

Am I supposed to hold them back so they don't have an opportunity to get even better and they come to dislike the game? To be that one or two kids on the ice all the other parents hate because they clearly are not playing at their level. I would love to see my kids with a scholarship or play for the country, who wouldn't? But to not have that opportunity because of inflated costs is just wrong on every level to me. My kids or someone elses.  Fortunately my wife and I are able to put our kids in hockey for as long as we have and at the levels they deserve to be at. I consider us some of the more fortunate."
828683,BillM,2014-01-05 18:45:00,17367,Thanks for proving my point.   You choose to pay in order for your kids to play a higher level of hockey.   So stop complaining about it being too expensive and being the downfall to our junior program (How you ever made a correlation between the two is beyond me)
