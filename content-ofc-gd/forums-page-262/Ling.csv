828647,Pickeral eater,2014-01-05 16:12:00,155,Hey All!  I am on my way up to nip next week and was wondering if any of u target ling?  I've been hearing good things in terms if size and eating ling.  what's the best way to fish for them?  Or are they something one doesn't target but hits them while jigging for walleye? Thanks in advance... Bill P.s. Looks like another disappointing world jrs.
828648,DRIFTER_016,2014-01-05 16:17:00,10439,Best fishing for ling is at night. Dead bait on bottom and jigging spoons tipped with bait are the best producers.
828650,manitoubass2,2014-01-05 16:32:00,11391,"Yeah i second the night comment. Deadbait just sitting there. I prefer to hold the rod as much as possible, sometime they take a bait so lightly youd think it would be impossible. They also love to tangle the crap outta your line lol"
828651,DRIFTER_016,2014-01-05 16:43:00,10439,"Almost forgot, the best spoons are glow in the dark."
828659,Pickeral eater,2014-01-05 17:35:00,155,Awesome!  Thanks guys.  I usually use 4 and 6lb line... Too light?
828661,manitoubass2,2014-01-05 17:40:00,11391,"I dont see why 6lb wouldnt work? When i catch em its usually on 8lb and ive never had an issue. Keep in mind the ones i catch are pretty small, about 25"". I think there much bigger south"
828740,Pickeral eater,2014-01-05 21:45:00,155,Cool  thanks again for the input.  I'll post my recap of next week.  Thanks again
828749,Rod Caster,2014-01-05 22:44:00,5784,"I've caught quite a few ling on Nip in past years.  6lbs test is fine.  Find deep water (25-35fow) in shoal-y areas. A large minnow (4-6"") on a hook or mid-sized spoons will work. It's difficult to 'target' them, but I've noticed that they will crowd an area if you provide a lot of bait. They'll stick around for a couple or more days.... I know this because I've found hooks and/or lures in their bellies from the preceeding day.  I haven't targetted them specifically, but if I were to, I would look for areas with a lot of perch, keep a few perch, fillet them and throw some carcass down the hole. Also, I would pop and drop all my remaining minnows down the hole.  We've caught many ling during the day, but generally it's better at late dusk. I don't fish at night typically, so I have no idea if it's any better at night.  Good luck!"
828759,Joeytier,2014-01-06 00:02:00,3990,"Ling are awesome,and super aggressive in the winter.  I've seen them rifle up off the bottom like a laker to smash a big buckshot, and they fight great too.  Cubed, boiled, and dipped in garlic butter...mmmm"
828771,Cosmos,2014-01-06 00:50:00,588,Came from Nipissing yesterday. Caught only one ling at 2 am Friday morning on huge dead minnow right on the bottom. Was using regular tip up inside hut. Second night brought me a nice mud puppet on the same setup.

Last year my nephew caught a ling on Wabakimi, first ling ever caught on this lake by our party.  If it were not for this fine site, I wouldn't have known what it was.  Saw em posted up on some of the Nip threads.  Very cool pic!  This is our little one. "

You can tell its spent most winter on the couch drinking beer and watching the hockey games."
