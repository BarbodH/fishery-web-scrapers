828185,Joey,2014-01-03 00:38:00,9122,"Ralphie was just outside doing his business and came running back into the house with this in his mouth.  What the heck is it from.  It was frozen but thawed almost immediately and blood starting coming out of the ""flesh"" end.  I can't be a cat, and seems to small for a dog.  I put the lighter for size reference and it is in the ziploc bag.  Anyone???              "
828186,Christopheraaron,2014-01-03 00:40:00,3525,Squirrel tail. Very nice squirrel tail I may add.
828187,fishnsled,2014-01-03 00:40:00,3520,Squirrel tail?  Just a guess.
828188,Joey,2014-01-03 00:43:00,9122,"Well how the heck did a squirrel lose it's tail?  Do they fall off or should I be worried about something that can bite a squirrel tail off.  I don't think it was Ralphie, but hey, he does chase them."
828189,Joey,2014-01-03 00:44:00,9122,Maybe it froze and broke off?
828190,Bernie,2014-01-03 00:53:00,3190,Looks like a worm with it's winter fur on.Probably catch a big one with that Joey

I don't think it was Ralphie, but hey, he does chase them. Cats and dogs sometimes catch the squirrels they chase. If it was frozen then it's likely someone else removed it and Ralph just found it."
828192,Joey,2014-01-03 00:58:00,9122,"Looks like a worm with it's winter fur on. Probably catch a big one with that Joey  Ya, no doubt Bernie, maybe I should put it in the freezer and save it for musky season"
828193,limeyangler,2014-01-03 01:06:00,5204,That dog would never get to lick me again!
828194,manitoubass2,2014-01-03 01:12:00,11391,Muskie bait?
828199,NAW,2014-01-03 01:40:00,4022,"Maybe it froze and broke off?  A victem of the ice storm?  Kidding.,.  Their tails don't stay on very well.  If Ralphie got a tail in his mouth, it would pop off easily..  I've been carrying them by their tails before and had the tail snap off, just from the weight from the squirel."
828200,Christopheraaron,2014-01-03 01:41:00,3525," Ya, no doubt Bernie, maybe I should put it in the freezer and save it for musky season Do it! Take the bone out, borax it, freeze it, then use it to make a couple bucktails"
828202,Whopper,2014-01-03 02:18:00,2174,So if Ralphie didn't do it can you account for Paul's whereabouts at said time?  
828206,woodenboater,2014-01-03 02:26:00,2277," Ya, no doubt Bernie, maybe I should put it in the freezer and save it for musky season  yup burn it across the surface, that'll get them feeding lol"
828212,Joey,2014-01-03 02:44:00,9122,"Hahaha, lovin the responses here.  Christopher, I think I will do that and Phil, Paul is ""supposedly"" at work  Woodenboater, a nice big hook in there and she'll burn right across the surface for sure"
828224,HTHM,2014-01-03 03:52:00,4082,"Squirrel tail for sure, fly tying material if you are so inclined."
828226,Steelheadphycho,2014-01-03 03:57:00,470,Don't ask..............    Just give it back......

828250,Christopheraaron,2014-01-03 13:53:00,3525,"Squirrel tail for sure, fly tying material if you are so inclined. And better than you will find in any store too."
828277,aplumma,2014-01-03 16:37:00,6896,Pop goes the weasel comes to mind. Good Job Ralphie boy.
828494,ch312,2014-01-04 19:08:00,1590,"Squirrel tail for sure, fly tying material if you are so inclined.  Yep, squirrel tail!  I have 3 grays and 1 black here if anyone wants them..."
