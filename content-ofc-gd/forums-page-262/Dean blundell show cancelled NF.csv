828836,leaf4,2014-01-06 19:01:00,2466,"Can't say I'm surprised!  http://m.thestar.com/#!/gta/redirect/f886e2702dab9b1578579d38bc8c01b6  also I'm pretty excited to hear what Todd has to say. http://www.torontomike.com/2014/01/dean_blundell_show_cancelled.html  if you read the last paragraph of the article referring to the shows cancellation it says he'll be in a tell all interview, hopefully it's a juicy one! haha."
828837,BillM,2014-01-06 19:02:00,17367,Should have been canceled after Jason Barr left.
828838,leaf4,2014-01-06 19:04:00,2466,"I did enjoy the back and forth between dean and Todd as childish as it sometimes could be it was at least entertaining, but without Todd they had to try extra hard he was the ying to the yang and without him it wasn't the same"
828839,BillM,2014-01-06 19:06:00,17367,"I think Barr kept those guys in check, once he left it just got really stupid."
828849,DRIFTER_016,2014-01-06 20:01:00,10439,The show was tolerable when Jason was there but sucked after he left. I miss the Humble and Fred days. Those guys were fun.
828858,woodenboater,2014-01-06 20:41:00,2277,"Humble and Fred yes. They were probably living on borrowed time and the stupidity of Derek mocking the sex assault trial that he was foreman of was the perfect excuse to can these idiots. Imo, Derek should have been punished severely for that. *The Edge* lost it's edge years agoâ€¦Give me Q107 or CBC any day"
828863,DRIFTER_016,2014-01-06 21:24:00,10439,Can't forget Pete & Geets either. Probably the best morning drive show Toronto ever had.
828865,frodobuggins,2014-01-06 21:27:00,127,I used to be long time listener back in 102.1 cfny days. 4 years ago I turned onto CBC radio 2 for morning and afternoon drives and haven't looked back.
828867,Acountdeleted,2014-01-06 21:35:00,2562,"I'm glad and I wish this has happened sooner, Dean was sexist, racist and homophobic.  Despite the fact that he claimed he was all for gay rights he would often comment on new reports or stories with ""If you ______ then you're gay."" In an derogatory tone.  After Jason Barr left I started listening to him and Chris Biggs on 97.7. Their self depreciation humor is much more enjoyable."
828873,Steve,2014-01-06 21:53:00,2075,"same here.  I was a ""fan"" (sorta, I did listen every morning for five years or so), then they kicked Jason out....so I followed.  Been listening to Biggs and Barr since 2011'ish.  Dean was always such a tool."
828880,jbailey,2014-01-06 22:22:00,866,couldn't stand the show anyway
828886,SirCranksalot,2014-01-06 22:41:00,3291,"I can't hit the radio buttons fast enough when I hear those yackety yahoo types with their ""banter"". Usually quite moronic."
828901,GBW,2014-01-07 00:05:00,8460,After Jason Barr left I started listening to him and Chris Biggs on 97.7. Their self depreciation humor is much more enjoyable. I would bounce from 97.7 to 102.1 all the time BUT I too left listening to 102.1 when the B&B show started @ 97.7.  I don't get the station anymore in the truck But the second I'm sitting at the PC I'm streaming the station.
828904,DRIFTER_016,2014-01-07 00:21:00,10439,"I would bounce from 97.7 to 102.1 all the time BUT I too left listening to 102.1 when the B&B show started @ 97.7.  I don't get the station anymore in the truck But the second I'm sitting at the PC I'm streaming the station.  Yep, I stream at work too. Been listening to CFNY since the ""Spirit Of Radio"" days back in the late 70's. The Late 70's through the 80's were definitely the best. IMHO"
828913,d_paluch,2014-01-07 01:32:00,343,"I admit I miss the show mainly for the 'what happened' and the awkward male/female questions segments.  Now I bounce between 97.7 and 107.9 for the morning shows. Jason Barr was the best part of the Blundell show, and Todd second. Don't get me wrong Dean had his moments, but he was such a hypocrite it actually made me mad at times.  Oh, and the music on the Edge sucks hard; minus a few gems"
828918,leaf4,2014-01-07 02:09:00,2466,"totally agree with the music being in the wrong direction, it's supposed to be new rock, it's practically a dance station!  also instant answer question time is hilarious some days, you just text 977977 and they'll read the question on the air but mainly they answer the questions pertaining to themselves so I usually just make fun of them and they end up reading it, or come up with a complete fabrication of a funny stir and they like those too haha"
828919,Cast-Away,2014-01-07 02:10:00,790,I got so sick of all of the chatter that I went to Sirius XM a year ago and never looked back. The only radio that I listen to now is 680 News
828921,GBW,2014-01-07 02:28:00,8460,94.9 in Durham now has Joe Cahill I understand formerly from 97.7.  He's a good sports guy IMO.  Even if I can tune into 102.1 I WON'T because of the music now played.  Rather listen to 99.9 or something like it than 102.1.  97.7 is the best station I have found for the past 20+ years by far.  94.9 is a close second.
828926,GBW,2014-01-07 02:41:00,8460,for those that need it: http://player.htzfm.com/
828993,cityfisher,2014-01-07 15:14:00,959,Nail in the cofin was when they brought it BILLIE to join Dean... what the hell?? talk about horrible move...shes as exciting as paint drying
829006,moxie,2014-01-07 15:55:00,1566,Should have been canceled after Jason Barr left. X2.  It does leave me with one question though. What the hell can we talk about and poke fun at without offending a single soul? Vanilla anyone?
829506,SmokestackLightnin,2014-01-09 16:51:00,390,"94.9 also has the Marsden Theatre on Saturday and Sunday nights.  For those, like myself, who enjoyed ""The Spirit of Radio"" back in the day listening to David Marsden on 94.9 is a trip down memory lane with lots of great music and the usual Marsden banter.  Shows are recorded and available for download."
