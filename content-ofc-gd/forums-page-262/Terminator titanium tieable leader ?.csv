( tried 40 # and found it really hard to tie ) Im looking for the Terminator brand in 25 -30 # Does anyone know where I can purchase this leader material, either in the GTA or on line ? Thanks in advance"

I only ever use it for fishing super light floating baits like Husky Jerks as the thin single strand is so light it allows the really light baits to fish much more effectively.  Have never been bitten off using the 20lb either, and I caught a good number of toothy fish using it.  For everything else (casting bucktails, spinnerbaits, trolling) I'm still partial to heavy fluoro."
829243,adempsey,2014-01-08 04:32:00,1498,The TyGer and Cortland tieable leader materials worked well enough for me.   I only have used it on my pike flies.  Haven't caught any trophy's with either yet though.
