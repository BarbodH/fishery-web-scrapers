828700,muskymatt,2014-01-05 19:21:00,2608,"I just bought a tow bar for my frabill hut and a couple folks have said they had front end damage to their huts from towing over uneven ground and impact with ice or debris.  Is this a common thing? Has anyone installed a ""skid plate"" on the front of their hut for protection? I was thinking of custom fitting an aluminum plate to the initial point of contact but didn't really want more hole in it.  "

Great job ya did too!  I have a couple pcs of left over aluminum from when I rebuilt my transom, they will work perfect!"

828797,Moosebunk,2014-01-06 03:48:00,3970,Dave... it's a mobile tank pop-up.  Wicked.
828806,wormdunker,2014-01-06 09:01:00,1711,Awesome Drifter -  Thanx for the pix.  I have a brand new clam - never used it yet.  I will be purchasing some aluminum today & installing it ASAP.
828823,Sinker,2014-01-06 17:12:00,8692,Make sure you put runners on the bottom. Thats where mine always gets punctured. Never had an issue with the tow bar causing damage.  S.
828878,wormdunker,2014-01-06 22:17:00,1711,Thanx Sinker I did install the runners.  I do see Drifter's point where damage can occur to the front of the sled.
828995,cityfisher,2014-01-07 15:18:00,959,+1 runners and reinforcing the front area... I learned my lesson once  Now mines a beast!
