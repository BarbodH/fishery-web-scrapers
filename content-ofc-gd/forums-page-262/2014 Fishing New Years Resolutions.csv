Build more on the fishing I have done last 5 years since coming home, maybe try and fit a new species or two into the summer season if not working or travelling much.  Leave ungrateful, delusional, freeloading drunks on shore, away from any fishing and out of my life.

Expand on smallie stuff I learnt last year... Drop shot is soooooo fun... Lol  Tighten up daily fishing areas... Currently I cover up to 20 miles of river some days... I'd like to learn smaller areas better close to my various launches to both reduce gas costs and slow down and try different colors... Lures... And techniques to get my fish...."
