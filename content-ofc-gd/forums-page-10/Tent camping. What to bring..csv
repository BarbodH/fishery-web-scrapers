1080538,Headhunter,2022-06-06 13:28:00,5703,"One of the first things we do is to bury our coolers up to the lid. Then cover them with moss to keep any sunlight off of them. You can't bring enough tarps and rope. Tie rocks to the tarp lines and throw the rocks up into nearby trees, wind the ropes around the tree truck to hold the tarps in place. If you have room, a fold out table can be really helpful. HH "

1080558,CrowMan,2022-06-06 22:35:00,413,You can have it shipped to you. https://www.dryiceexpress.ca/
1080560,CrowMan,2022-06-06 22:49:00,413,"Back in the day...some ""ganja gardeners"" would use dry ice in their grow ops. Dry ice is frozen carbon dioxide, when it ""melts"" it becomes CO2 gas, which super-charges plant growth. The fact that as it ""melts"" it becomes a gas and not a liquid makes it great for storing food in a cooler...nothing ever gets soggy."
1080564,Canuck,2022-06-07 15:36:00,491,Depending on where you are camping: 1. A folding grill for cooking over an open fire.  Those park ones are nasty and you can lay these over the nasty grills or use them on their own. 2. Lots of aluminum foil for cooking things on and in 3. Extra tent pegs and those screw in dog leash holders are great for anchoring a tarp in wind when the trees are not where you need them. 4. You can get those little battery powered LED lights that are cheap and are great for nice subtle lighting under tarps or over your picnic table.   https://www.amazon.ca/Lyhope-Battery-Operated-Waterproof-Decoration/dp/B07DL531D9/ref=sr_1_52?crid=2L5RDQKUHEIDC&keywords=battery+led+lights&qid=1654616042&sprefix=battery+led+lights%2Caps%2C167&sr=8-52

1080489,LostAnotherOne,2022-06-02 18:07:00,956,We are coming upon our second year camping off the grid and we are still learning as we go.  Just purchased a new Yeti cooler ($400) to keep our meats cold for the week.  If you like fires bring a saw or bring your own wood with a tarp.  I like using disposable plates and bowls.  You'll probably forget some things like most people.  Disposable wipes is an important one too.  Have fun and good luck Glen.

A recite showing the seller's name, address, and contact info. I used to repair the CFIA's vehicles here in London and Brian Hamilton (Enforcement officer) said the fines depending on severity of the offence can reach into the ten's of thousands of dollars and or possible jail time. I understand the wood would only be for a couple of camp fires, but the CFIA is worried about what may crawl out of the wood waiting to be burned. They also work with the OPP and the MNR to help find offenders. Just a heads up. Dan..."

People can come and go without the zipper ritual. Shelter from shade and rain, and can be placed over the firepit, if high enough. and ropes/lines. bring way more than you think you'll need. you'll regret not having more when you can't tie things down haha "

The meal cooler only gets opened once a day and stays in the shade. pack your food tightly with ice to reduce air. It can be tough to keep your food frozen for long enough. Dont rely on fish to eat...You certainly will end up with some act of god that prevents you from having food.  Rope, mosquito coils for the evening as the sun sets surround your campfire where you hand out with them and you will be comfortable during the most brutal time of the day."

1080520,DanD,2022-06-04 20:05:00,2223,What we've been using at the trailer is an oil burning lantern filled with a citronella based oil. It gives off a decent amount of light and it does help with the bugs. What I've been doing is to light the lantern (outside) about a half-hour before we go to sit out on the deck. Leaving the wick set a little high to produce some extra smoke. Once outside I turn the wick down to get a nice flame. I agree that the green coils work well; but my wife can't stand the smell of? Dan... 
1080521,16 Footer,2022-06-04 20:32:00,191,New tents can leak especially if the tent fly ( cheap tents) does not go to the ground level. Spray fly and floor seams with silicon on the outside. Get a warm sleeping bag good to 0C or lower. I would not use a cot just a good thermacell under the bag.
1080524,DanD,2022-06-04 22:04:00,2223,"I agree 100% with the thermacell underlay, keeps you warm and dry while laying down. I'd still like a cot, I'll be off the ground (incase of a tent rain flood) or accidentally picking the ONLY lump/rock or whatever under the sleeping bag, that jabs you not matter how you move. A thermacell will still work on top of a cot; it'll keep the dew off the underside of your sleeping bag. Speaking of lumps under a tent; we set up a new tent in out backyard, just to see how it went up. The kids and I were going to sleep in it that night. While Cathy (my wife) was laying out the sleeping bags, she finds this lump under the tent's floor about the size of a small pinecone. So I'm asked (told) to go under the tent and remove it. So I did and when I came out from under, I found myself holding a petrified piece of dog crap!!! LOL Dan.."
1080528,akaShag,2022-06-05 00:31:00,2073,"That would get a bit warm, I think they are powered by a butane flame.  😲 But a Thermarest is a good piece of kit.  The long version, that fits your whole body, not the short one!  😉 Doug"
1080533,Weeds,2022-06-05 22:49:00,782,At least a couple of lighters as your guaranteed to lose the first one before you even use it. A hatchet. Some kind of camp knife. Couple pairs of cheap cheater glasses. Something to read on rainy days or if the kids ever give you a moments peace. Aspirin because they probably won’t.
