1080854,Dan668,2022-06-22 23:32:00,1120,"I use the Graph Glass ""Clear"" on my Live and Carbon 12. Pricey but I am sure it adds a bit of protection. Cheap insurance versus a broken screen which at one point, no option existed to repair. Wish the coverage was better, has a fair amount of space between the edge to the border of the screen. Otherwise, no issues. Works fine with polarized sunglasses. I have heard that the anti glare washes out the image. "
