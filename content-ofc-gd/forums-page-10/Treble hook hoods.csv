1080748,SirCranksalot,2022-06-18 00:34:00,3291,"Finally found a solution to stop treble hooks from becoming entangled. Like most(all?) fishermen I carry too many lures, too many for each to have its own little compartment. So I put 2 or 3 in the same comp and they inevitably become entangled.   I have tried various 'solutions' over the years incl a few DIY ones such as wrapping the hooks in foil. I have also bought hoods similar to those shown but w/o the little ring for removal. The ring makes all the diff. Those w/o it were hard to remove to the point of becoming a hazard. These are from aliexpress. I have never bought anything from them until very recently. I know many have an aversion to Chinese gear, though. "
1080753,BillM,2022-06-18 12:11:00,17367,Ever thought of simply taking your lures off before transport?
1080755,SirCranksalot,2022-06-18 12:45:00,3291,"sorry, I think you misunderstood my post. I am talking about getting them tangled in the tackle boxes."
1080839,BillM,2022-06-22 12:26:00,17367,Gotcha.  I think we've all done the shake and pray before lol!

1080872,SirCranksalot,2022-06-24 02:57:00,3291,"I have never seen the hoods with a little ring on them for sale locally. That ring, IMO, makes all the diff for safe and easy removal.

1080876,AKRISONER,2022-06-24 14:35:00,5558,"what ""model"" number did you choose. There's no reference to what that means. Im assuming doing something in the middle fits your standard treble hook?"
1080877,SirCranksalot,2022-06-24 14:45:00,3291,If you dig deep enough I think you'll find some ref to sizes. I didn't----just took a stab at it and they fit most of mine.
1080878,AKRISONER,2022-06-24 14:58:00,5558,thanks for the link I placed an order for 2 20 packs. I recently paid $8 for I think 6 of these or something outrageous. One of those things where you know you are getting taken.
