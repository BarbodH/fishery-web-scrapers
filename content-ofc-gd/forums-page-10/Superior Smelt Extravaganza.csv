Having been there before, I loved the area and it was a quick yes. We planned to head up the dates of April 28th to May 1st which is one of my most favorite times of the year to be north. Longer days, potential for nice weather, and no bugs! The drive up was eventful and arriving at camp was as well... everything was exactly how he had left it in November. He is right on the shore of the big lake and the last of the ice caves that form every winter were still there. About 10 feet of ice still formed on the break wall. We had also timed the smelt run perfectly so that was something we had to participate in. The weather was perfect... little wind and 15-18 degrees. All in all it was an excellent trip. The drive sure is long  but the area is just spectacular. Can't wait to get up again. Cheers! BassMan                "

We used to camp late April/early May at the mouth of Speckled Trout Creek in Lake Superior Provincial Park. During the day we would chase Steelhead in the local tribs...Chippewa, Pancake, Sand, Agawa, Old Woman, Michipicoten...and at night we would dip for Smelt at the stream mouths. Nothing like a feed of fresh Smelt fried in Ritz cracker crumbs over an open fire on the shores Gitcha Gumee."

Thanks for the report! Doug"
