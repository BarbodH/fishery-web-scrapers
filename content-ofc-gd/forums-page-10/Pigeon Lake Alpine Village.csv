1080376,Raycaster,2022-05-25 23:04:00,528,We have been looking at possible houses in the Kawarthas now that the kids are gone and time to downsize. There are several properties for sale in Alpine Village on Pigeon Lake. How does the community sharing work? What are the pros and cons and why are so many properties up all at once? We rent every year on Balsam but never see anything close to our budgetâ€¦  Any info appreciated.
