We won't have a boat, just canoes. Thanks! Richard"

1032586,Reef Runner,2018-08-13 20:16:00,980,Both Largemouth and Smallmouth as well as perch in the lake.  If you're fishing with the kiddos bring worms and set them up under a float so it's a more interactive experience watching the float go down.
1032590,Snidley,2018-08-13 21:12:00,620,If you can get on Crooked Lake in the Minden area that lake is killer. There used to be a fly in fishing lodge there that has boats etc. I did a fly in with a pilot buddy and we hammered them bigtime. I think boat/canoe access is difficult however.

1033146,cuzza,2018-08-27 18:49:00,467,Thanks Chris - can confirm the walleye as we got into a few along with plenty of smallies. A good time was had by all - thanks again for the tips guys
