1080057,crappieperchhunter,2022-05-05 16:19:00,2582,Looks like a great outing. Enjoy the many fish fries.
1080252,akaShag,2022-05-15 13:49:00,2073,"There are some real hawgs there!  Do you guys jig for them, or fish minnows, or ??? Doug"
1080264,huey graphite,2022-05-16 13:25:00,362,Fish the bottom with pickerel rigs/minnows in 45-70FOW.
1080272,akaShag,2022-05-16 18:56:00,2073,"Very interesting indeed, that they are so deep.  I imagine you must catch the odd walleye when perch fishing?  That would be a bonus!  (assuming walleye are open)"
1080279,dave524,2022-05-16 21:33:00,4508,"I've seen pics of a few Lakers coming off those perch grounds this spring , one was a real huge slob edit for pic :"
1080286,pics,2022-05-17 07:47:00,1268,I did alright on Friday but I didn't stick with the crowd of boats.. I watched the electronics and only put a line down when I saw them on the graph..    
1080346,huey graphite,2022-05-22 14:13:00,362,"Wow! Haven't seen many, if any lakers come out of Erie! Nice fish!"
1080347,huey graphite,2022-05-22 14:16:00,362,It's not uncommon to get walleye while perch fishing on Erie. A couple years ago I landed a 13lb channel cat on perch gear.
1080348,huey graphite,2022-05-22 14:17:00,362,Nice haul!
1080378,Slingfisher,2022-05-26 13:00:00,8,Are you fishing out of Ft Erie?
1080431,pics,2022-05-30 12:37:00,1268, Most of the boats were concentrated near crystal beach.. it would seem the the fish have now scattered so it's a guessing game as to where they are...
