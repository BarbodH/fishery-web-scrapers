1081028,akaShag,2022-07-03 14:44:00,2073,"That is VERY interesting indeed.  I bought this rig months ago and the dealer was having lots of issues getting the warranty registered.  I still do not have the warranty paperwork,  But I kind of assumed that the dealer was at fault, they are a small business and boats are only a minor sideline..........  Thanks for the heads-up. Doug"
1081031,porkpie,2022-07-03 20:33:00,2521,"Doug, Your unlikely to have any problems with that yamaha.  I unfortunately had a one off bad Yamaha 2 stroke on my duck boat bought new up at the old Thomboy power sports in Owen sound. They didn’t do me wrong, but Yamaha Canada sure did.  Like I said, most all of their product is solid as rock.  It’s those one offs you have to worry about!  I hope your paperwork gets sorted out quickly!"
1080820,siwash,2022-06-21 14:27:00,683,It's an 18 HP mid-80s Merc. We're those good engines?
1080831,porkpie,2022-06-22 01:30:00,2521,"Not especially no, and I owned a merc small motor from that generation at one time.  I paddled home from several duck hunts, and I generally keep my equipment well tuned and regularly serviced.  It would rank among my last choices of old motors from the 80’s, second only to a Chrysler.  My first choice would be a 2 cylinder Johnston/evinrude from the late 80’s to mid 90’s."
1080836,siwash,2022-06-22 03:04:00,683,"h that's too bad!  I just put in a conditional offer... going tomorrow.. the boat is mine as long as I like what I see in person...  Motor will be started for me... and it runs well - at least now it does.  I like the boat.. 16.5 x 67"" I'll post pics when I get it home!"
1080837,porkpie,2022-06-22 04:06:00,2521,"Well, if the motor runs and the boat doesn’t leak an old motor can be replaced down the road should it give you grief!"
1080962,GYPSY400,2022-06-29 15:58:00,191,"Personally I have no problems with the 18 merc, although Johnnyrudes have a better reputation. I believe the weak point is the ignition system,  but every motor has its shortcomings.    keep in mind Johnson and evinrudes will be harder to get parts for in the coming years as manufacturing has stopped. My issue is that an 18 is pretty small for a 16ft boat.. that should have at least a 25, if not a 30hp on it.. but you can always upgrade the motor in a few years."
1080963,siwash,2022-06-29 16:58:00,683,Yes the motor is small.  Boat is rated for up to 40. Johnsons are not being made anymore or you mean the parts aren't? 
1080966,GYPSY400,2022-06-29 18:11:00,191,"Yes Johnsons haven't been made since early 2000's, and evinrude shut down in 2020.. I'm not sure if they are still making parts, but when I went to the dealer 2 months ago he said parts are going to be harder and harder to get as production of motors has stopped.. I'm guessing once their stockpile of parts is gone, they're gone.  OEMs ( all oems) have a commitment to supply parts 10 years after the production date of the unit."
1080967,siwash,2022-06-29 18:22:00,683,Oh wow. Had no idea that such an iconic name brand is not longer manufacturing. What happened?
1080970,GYPSY400,2022-06-29 20:29:00,191,"BRP ( skidoo, Can-am) bought OMC, phased out Johnson and developed E-TEC.. decent motor, but they have their issues. once covid hit they felt they didn't have market share to compete with mercury and Yamaha.. so the bean counters shut down evinrude.  Eventually,  if not already, they will stop making parts for all evinrudes"
1080974,siwash,2022-06-29 22:28:00,683,You'd think there would continue to be an after market industry for parts. I just bought a fuel filter off Amazon for the merc and the name was Siera
1080975,akaShag,2022-06-29 23:35:00,2073,don't count on it..............
1080987,GYPSY400,2022-06-30 19:50:00,191,"Yes Sierra builds almost anything other than engine blocks and chassis etc.  But the quality isn't the same and some parts ( ignition) you shouldn't cheap out on.  I use Sierra gaskets and stuff like that, but most of the time oem parts aren't that much more money and they have stock, vs. having to order it and making a second trip.. 2 bucks a litre wipes out the money saved."
1080992,siwash,2022-07-01 12:08:00,683,"The Merc is running much better after I switched out lower unit oil, plugs, fuel filter, fresh gas and sprayed carb with gunk remover...  Idles well, too that was the main issue. I might just list it and look for a bigger johnson/evinrude... Thanks you all your advice guys..."
1080993,siwash,2022-07-01 12:09:00,683,What are your thoughts on the 1960s Johsons/Evinrudes?  
1080994,Terry,2022-07-01 12:53:00,14456,Like all of them hard on fuel and could be 24:1 mix. So lots of oil to mix
1080995,GYPSY400,2022-07-01 12:58:00,191,"1960's vintage is too old and hard to get parts for.  The oldest I'd go is early 80's if you don't want to wrench on it ALL the time.  Personally I'd run what you have for the season and look for something in the fall.  The prices goes down slightly as people don't want to store them for the winter, then they shoot back up around May 24 weekend.   But since Covid, and now supply chain issues prices are higher than normal on everything. "
1080997,AKRISONER,2022-07-01 13:25:00,5558,I don’t know how old you are…but try to put in perspective how long ago the 1960’s actually were. I personally wouldn’t buy a 60 year old motor and hope that it gets me off of the lake when a storm roles in. 
1081002,siwash,2022-07-01 17:25:00,683,One of the best motors (most reliable) I've ever owned was a 1960 envinrude fastwin. That was 15 years ago so that motor was close to 50 years old.
1081004,GYPSY400,2022-07-01 18:51:00,191,"Agreed.. I won't buy a motor that's older than a year I can remember.. and I'm 45.  I couldn't be bothered with old junk anymore. 10 years ago I got fed up with everything, it was getting to the point where I'd troubleshoot Tuesday,  order parts and install by Thursday so i can fish friday and Saturday.. just so i can do the same thing next week! got sick of it and bought a brand new BMT package.  So far its been 2 impellers and other routine stuff, but I can guarantee that boat will run all weekend without issue. Everyone has their own budgets, but it gets to a point where time with family and friends outweigh working on an old motor to save a few hundred bucks.  Some guys love the vintage stuff and enjoy fixing and tinkering with it.  I do that 40hrs a week so when it's time to go fishing,  the last thing I want to see is a wrench! LoL  but to each their own, as everyone has a different situation and ""toy"" budget."
1081012,AKRISONER,2022-07-02 02:44:00,5558,"Owned two Yamahas so far, both completely flawless…and good thing because between the trailers and then 22 and now new to me 15 year old boat respectively they gave/give me enough work to do to keep my schedule full of tinkering…never mind the arsenal of reels that need maintenance every year. anyone else a trailer warrior like me? lol welds and wiring something is always causing me a pita"
1081021,porkpie,2022-07-02 22:00:00,2521,"My thoughts are that boating on the ultra cheap usually yields disappointment.  If you have a running 18hp merc at the moment, and a serviceable used 16 foot tin boat, then I’d be saving my money for a newer 30hp 4 stroke Honda or Suzuki.  There is not a whole lot that can go wrong with a 16 foot tinner.  If the transom goes, you can generally replace it quite easily if your handy.  A small leak?  Tip it over and get a buddy to help you bang some rivets tight.  Flooring shot?  Rip it out and replace.  It the boats in decent shape it will last you for years.  The motors have a finite lifespan.  And while that old Johnny may run well, it will break down eventually or as someone else said, it’ll smoke like mad.  If you buy once and cry once on a newer motor, you’ll be on the water trouble free for years."
1081023,akaShag,2022-07-02 23:54:00,2073,"I switched to Yamaha this year after many rave reviews from folks whose opinions I respect.  I drove only Hondas for over 30 years, but where I live in Kingston, ON there is nobody to service them and I can't do diddly squat by myself.  So for me it's Yamaha from this point forward.  And yes, newer motors for sure.  Never had a Suzuki, don't have any buddies who have Suzukis, but their reputation is good also. Doug"
1081024,GYPSY400,2022-07-03 00:17:00,191,"Words of wisdom ^^^^^^ Buy once, cry once.  The nice thing about new outboards is that you'll get 10 to 15, maybe even 20 years of trouble free service with only routine maintenance.   Yeah there are horror stories, but for the most part any outboard is pretty reliable nowadays."
1081025,AKRISONER,2022-07-03 01:12:00,5558,"Except those evinrude G2 motors, holy cow the horror stories.  every manufacturer has had its issues in some particular powers. for example the 2006 yamaha vmax engines, the 200 was flawless but the 225 and 250 were time bombs due to an oil starvation issue on cylinder 6. Lucky for anyone buying a used outboard you can typically google the motor and year you are looking at and figure out which ones are good vs bad. there were Johnson motors that were flawless, there were mercury ones too…the difference is that bad Yamaha’s and Hondas and Suzukis are typically the exception instead of the rule. almost all of the 2020+ four stroke motors these days are really really good. They are running reasonably older technology now with all of the kinks worked out."
1081026,porkpie,2022-07-03 02:29:00,2521,"While I’d agree with you that Yamaha generally makes a good motor, and the majority are trouble free, if you ever have to deal with Yamaha Canada on a real warranty issue you might find yourself having an interesting time.  I have a good used running 9.9 Yamaha 4 stroke on  my tinner, and I’d probably buy a good running used one again.  I’d never buy one under warranty as the warranty is useless paper in my mind and I won’t pay for that privilege again!"
1080682,siwash,2022-06-15 03:34:00,683,"Would like to hear your pros/cons for both! I am considering an aluminum and FG both 16' for fishing and a bit of putting around with the kids/wife... both are tillers. Lakes will vary, some with rocks and logs. I am nervous about hitting something with a glass boat.. on the other had, glass is more stable/solid on the water... what about maintenance ? Other things I'm not considering? Fuel costs?  thanks!"
1080683,AKRISONER,2022-06-15 11:18:00,5558,"Basically every single aspect of an aluminum boat wins over a glass boat except for perhaps the most important aspect, and that’s ride quality. Ask yourself this, owning a glass boat is like a sacrifice, if you are willing to wash the boat after every use and ceramic coat it every year and baby it? As my boss said yesterday when I was talking about how much I baby my boat, “you obviously don’t have 3 kids!” no matter how solid the hull, I’ve fished in those ultimate heavy duty aluminum boats everything from a lund tyee, kingfishers and alumacrafts, right down to the entry level smokercraft, and StarCraft and the middle range crestliner etc and you will just never ever get honestly anywhere near the ride of a glass boat. and then each glass boat will ride differently than the other, ask a bass guy about the ride difference between a ranger and a skeeter, or even crazier a nitro and a champion or gambler. The hull designs on glass boats matter a lot, with each company somewhat owning their own hull design, it’s not a standard “Deep V shape  one size fits all solution” personally I’m thinking you will want to try and take a ride in a variety of aluminum boats and feel the difference between their hulls because it’s noticeable by brand. Then go take a ride in a glass boat, you may or may not fall in love. i wouldn’t worry too much about this “put a hole in a glass boat” thing unless you fish a hell of a lot of lakes without any charts in them? I’ve been boating 15 years now and have yet to hit a rock with my boat. I also drive with a big graph in front of my face at all times. To my it’s the only truly safe way to navigate on the water."
1080688,siwash,2022-06-15 13:10:00,683,"Interesting and informative post. Thanks! I will mostly fish smallish lakes so I won't be in big swells. I will hit simcoe though a few times a year as that is my closest body of water. In that lake a FG would probably come in handy for comfort reasons. However I am basically looking at what would be considered ""utility"" boats (I.e. boats  with three benches across with a tiller configuration). I won't be ""cruising"" with this boat much but the family might come out a couple times per year. It'll primarily be a fishing boat hitting lakes/areas like Balsam/kawarthas, port Severn, cooks bay, sparrow, and some haliburton lakes on occasion... I do like the layout out of the FG and the person I am dealing with has been a gentleman. Both boats seem pretty good at least based on the online ads.  I am looking at the aluminum first and he's willing to let me take it out for a spin. An issue the aluminum boat has is that the ""motor has difficulty in reverse as it drops out of reverse"". Apparently he has to hold his hand on the lever so the boat stays in reverse.  Not being mechanically inclined I'm not sure how serious this is but he says it hasn't stopped him from using the boat. "
1080690,BillM,2022-06-15 14:40:00,17367,You'll want an aluminum after reading your use case.
1080697,AKRISONER,2022-06-15 19:53:00,5558,"Yup, sounds like you want an aluminum tiller. Save you some $ towing around too"
1080702,HTHM,2022-06-16 10:33:00,4082,"That is the best policy, always do a lake test before buying a boat.  The falling out of reverse MAY be a simple fix of adjusting the shift linkage, or it could mean that the lower unit needs major gear repairs. Make sure you budget for ""improvements"" when you buy a boat."
1080705,AKRISONER,2022-06-16 11:53:00,5558,"Hthm is 1000% correct, do not buy a used boat without a budget to work and fix the problems that you will inherit. It’s a normal reality, boats break…a lot lol they are a life of tinkering if over 7 years old effectively. If that’s not your thing then go new."
1080706,siwash,2022-06-16 12:05:00,683,New is ridiculously expensive. I want to keep this to a utility boat so that it should minimize the things to fix. I have kept the extra costs along the way in mind.
1080707,siwash,2022-06-16 12:06:00,683,Thanks for the contributions folks!
1080708,siwash,2022-06-16 12:07:00,683,Was supposed to see a boat very early this morning up in parry sound. But there was high risk of severe t storms. the glass boat I was looking at sold.
1080711,akaShag,2022-06-16 15:47:00,2073,"I asked that same question of a man with a PhD in materials science (or something like that).  He said to me, ""would you ever pull this boat up on a sandy beach?""  Indeed I would says I, and he says, ""buy aluminum."" That was three boats ago, all aluminum of course.  The second one I bought new in 1998, and sold it this spring for 75% of what I paid for it 24 years ago.  And even though I did beach it, and bumped into the odd rock and the odd stump, etc, it was still water-tight, no leaks. BTW most of my fishing is like the OP. Doug"
1080713,AKRISONER,2022-06-16 18:12:00,5558,"thats another thing...the right boat will not last. Ive bought two boats now and Ive seen a total of 3 including the two boats I bought in all of my searching for boats. When you are ready to buy, you will know when you have hit the right deal. The due dilligence is the test drive, leak check and compression test. From there if its priced right, bring your money with you because if it is, it wont last."
1080790,siwash,2022-06-20 10:19:00,683,Update on the boat buying experience - in a word - frustrating!! i went to see one on mill lake (Parry Sound). Boat was decent but the reverse had issue (as I stated in previous post). Thought for the money too high considering the fix required. Otherwise I liked the boat. I left and the guy messages be back later when I got home and offers it for quite bit less - 30% less. So I message him back and he sold it in the few minutes (to someone who didn't even see it) that passed between messaging. I thought that was pretty classless.  He had my number. He could have at least called me since I drove almost 4 hours back and forth. I told him as much. What can you do... 	then yesterday a boat popped up on Facebook marketplace- called him up and agreed to see the boat today. Looked real nice. I go back to check the ad and it was sold - literally 45 min later. not a great time ti buy... seems like market is very tight for decent boats. They go fast! People buying unseen! Obviously I'd rather see it first but it's hard to get out to these places that fast.. does the market get better in the latter half of summer and fall? I might just wait as this is frustrating!
1080791,kshick91,2022-06-20 11:48:00,3,There has been a shortage of boats since the start of covid. Anything that is half decent sells very very fast. I experienced this 2 years ago. You really have to act fairly quickly.
1080792,siwash,2022-06-20 12:33:00,683,"Yea, I have learned that now. In the case of the boat with the wonky reverse though, that was the seller not being honourable. He should have had the decency to call me.  This boat sat for a long time because he had it listed initially at a very high price. He even apologized to me for having driven all the way there because the ad listed the boat as a 16' and not was actually 14' when we measured it. That was an honest mistake I believe. anyhow ultimately you can sell to whom ever you want but there are codes/rules that we should follow."
1080793,AKRISONER,2022-06-20 13:39:00,5558,"Siwash speaking from my own personal experience, you will probably have a pretty good feeling that you are buying the boat prior to even seeing it. Both times in my experience, the communication from the seller was perfect leading up to the transaction, I basically knew everything about the boat before even meeting them. I showed up and within 5 minutes I knew I was buying it. I just then went through the process of confirming that the compression was correct and that the boat didnt leak. Good sellers are typically guys that are only selling this boat because they upgraded to a better boat. That a lot of the time means that the guy was fishing out of the boat you are buying and simply went bigger/newer. One boat I test drove, the other i started from cold in the driveway and revved it up. On an aluminum boat I probably wouldnt buy it without seeing it sit in the lake for half an hour just to make sure the rivets aren't blown right from the get go. An honest seller will probably start the conversation by telling you everything wrong with the boat lol. My newest boat the seller outright told me, yup I hit a rock and had to replace the lower end. He then even gave me the receipts for the work. Pointed out a few chips in the glass and told me about getting a recall done from yamaha. Its pretty obvious the guy isnt hiding anything when they do that. Remember no used boat is perfect, even ones that say ""immaculate"" they essentially never are. Its a matter of the fundamentals being in check. A bad engine or hull is a problem. A few nicks and bangs or wear spots give the boat character and a lot of things can be cleaned up or fixed with a bit of elbow grease, silicone and PC 11 "
1080794,siwash,2022-06-20 14:11:00,683,"And this is exactly what happened. Sellers were honest and very forthcoming. I had a great feeling about both. I think both boats would have served me well. Your advice is solid and something I've followed with anything I've bought over the years.  You know,, generally, who are the suspicious ones.  A guy in the Kawartha area has a 16' since May. Fishy guy. You can tell. He never used the boat. They put in a floor and spruced it up a bit. I doubt they had any idea if it was leaking. He claimed it didn't but how could he know? I walked away from it after talking to him on the phone."
1080795,siwash,2022-06-20 14:13:00,683,"And both of the two sellers I've dealt with were older, retired men. Not to generalize but I get better feeling from these types of sellers. They both owned the boats for many years."
1080797,siwash,2022-06-20 15:24:00,683,Another seller said said motor needs a new impeller. What is the approximate cost to replace one on an 80s 20 HP Johnson? And is this something that I can do myself?  thanks.
1080798,Terry,2022-06-20 15:48:00,14456,"Somewhere between 15 and 50 bucks and on a small motor you should have no problem ,you can find YouTube videos to help"
1080804,AKRISONER,2022-06-20 20:52:00,5558,Impeller is easy if you can get the kit. I’d make sure you can still get one. im also curious as to how this guy knows that a new impeller is all it needs? It’s so easy and reasonably priced to do it seems strange that he would sell it without it done? Could be larger issues at play?
1080811,porkpie,2022-06-21 01:02:00,2521,"A marina will charge you about $200 tax in.  Their shop rates are $125 an hour most places these days.  Terry is right it’s not hard on a small motor to do it yourself if your handy!  Whenever I’ve sold a boat in the past I’ve always told the guy to replace the impeller.  That said, I’ve never sold one without a functioning impeller either!"
1080814,AKRISONER,2022-06-21 12:17:00,5558,"As a rule, when you buy a used boat even if the impeller is working, you change the impeller. unless of course the owner tells you that he literally just had it done. i did an impeller on my 130 on my front lawn having never done one in my life and I found it very straight forward. Hardest part was realizing how to twist the housing down on the rubber so that it would actually go into the housing. It’s one of those jobs that because everything is intact to begin with and typically nothing is broken, you simply disassemble and then just reassemble in the exact same order with your new parts (gaskets, the impeller) the hard part on a big motor can be re-aligning the gearshaft and that’s just because it’s heavy as hell. On a small motor, easy Peazy can be done by yourself.  youtube is your friend for sure!"
1080816,siwash,2022-06-21 14:01:00,683,Ok. Thanks. another seller just sent me a video of his motor running. Switched gears too. Noticed water was coming out steadily and strong. Would this be an good indicator that the water pump/ impeller are still working well? thanks! 
1080818,HTHM,2022-06-21 14:21:00,4082,Yes.
