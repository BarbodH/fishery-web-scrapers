I’m really all over the place so a slip in one marina is a waste of money basically. I have contacted a few storage places just waiting for replies. Jordon Harbour seemed to have a lower parking lot off to the side with several boats on trailers but replied “they have no slips available”… Indicated in email that I don’t require a slip but… whatever. Don’t need a enclosed area or anything fancy as it basically just gets covered in the winter… Any suggestions welcome, thank you."
