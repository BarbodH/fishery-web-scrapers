I wonder how many products from the original thread from 2010 have now out sourced off shore now ?. Many I believe if they are in the business to make money which ultimately the goal of every business, well most businesses.  Would you feel any Steel coming from Arcelor Mittal or US Steel here in Ontario not considered Canadian? I would, 99% of the staff are Canucks as well as the ancillary suppliers employees.

They now focus on there deeper diver sales, good product but also not made in canada. Just distributed by a canadian company.. They also have a hunting division quigley bows and scopes I believe.   I know Scotty down riggers is already listed but they are one of the best examples of a pure canadian business there is. Every part that is on a Scotty rigger is made in Canada. In fact almost every part on the rigger is made directly in the Scotty Plastics factory. With the exception of the new digital counters ( made in Canada however) and the stainless bolts ( also made in canada) In 60 years they have never sold out or out sourced to China... Its actually amazing.  Beyond downriggers Scotty also makes many other products. The egg incubators they make are used all over north america to help keep producing fish for the future.

575559,aplumma,2011-04-23 20:17:00,6896,I think with all of the blending of the worlds resources and the spreading of manufacturers names few products can pass the made in Canada litmus test. Most of the ones that can are either use resources that are local to the area or the craftsman are partial to the area. To take it further what is the difference between a Canadian made boat built with parts from another nation and a Canadian store with made in China lures? My thought is when you get past the grass roots shops then it becomes immaterial as to were it is hailed from if the money is going outside of Canada back to corporate or to purchase material from abroad. If you look at the company called Moen it is a USA company that has spent millions to bring jobs to Canada and to also bring a good product name for the average consumer. Teleflex is a company that hails from Canada but has factories in both the USA and Canada and the USA accounts for 65% of its sales. It produces a fine product for both sides to enjoy and brings home a nice profit in jobs and money but it falls short of your requirements to be listed as a Canadian made company.   Art
575763,Dave Bailey,2011-04-24 13:48:00,1641," What I would like is to have the entries as 'Canadian' as possible. I realise that it's very difficult (at least for me) to find out where the metal was mined, smelted into steel, and turned into the hook dangling on a Lucky Strike lure, but if the company is based here and the bulk of the manufacturing is done here then I'll include it. If it's based elsewhere, or if they manufacture off-shore, then no, I wouldn't consider it Canadian made. There are some things that are unavoidable, for instance if a bass plug was made from balsa, a wood that doesn't grow in Canada, then I'll make allowances."

503342,ColdH20guy,2010-09-12 21:22:00,312,"yes, I am proud to be Canadian but who cares where they are made as long as the product is a good one and you like to use it to catch fish. They could be from USA to Australia to Canada..as long as they make a product that you like...who cares. I'm sure there is something in your house that you will use tonight..whether it be for supper, sitting on after supper to watch a televsion, or whatever..that is not 100% Canadian. dumb thread...jmho"
503346,stasbrute,2010-09-12 22:08:00,206,"Many disagree with you coldh20guy, I for one think if a Canadian product is as good or close to as good as one that is made off shore I will buy the Canadian one for sure. In fact I would even pay a little more for the ""Home made"" product, I have to admit it is hard to buy Canadian all the time but I do try. I am thankful for the information in this thread good going everyone."
503383,ColdH20guy,2010-09-13 00:11:00,312," like I said, its just my opinion...cheers"
503388,mercman,2010-09-13 00:38:00,7054, Well said This whole thread has been a wonderful reminder that we as Canadians are able to contribute some very useful and well recognized products. I for one try my best to purchase Canadian.Price isn't everything and i believe you get what you pay for and we make quality stuff worth the few dollars more.
503403,Dave Bailey,2010-09-13 01:45:00,1641," I care, and it's not just about buying Canadian, it's as much about not buying from countries which should not be supported. The main offender is China which has a human rights record that is frightening. Minor non-violent crimes like business fraud can get you a death sentence, it has even been used on people for simply belonging to organisations like Falun Gong. You could be a young mother with a family, but if your tissue matches that of a rich westerner who wants your kidney you are strapped to a bed and cut up for spare parts. Brazil is another example. Police death squads have been known to walk the streets of Rio de Janeiro and Sao Paulo at night killing children for the 'crimes' of being homeless and orphaned. They treat them as vermin who scare away tourists. Canada is not perfect, we have our own injustices, but we are better than most countries in this world.  I care."

This company has grown to huge success in under a year. Best thing and reason I use them is that they are Canadian made. Nothing goes outside. The ownwr is a person who beleives in keeping everything here. Anything to do with the business stays here. Thats why I support them as well as I love the product.  http://www.therodglove.com/
527716,Dave Bailey,2010-12-12 13:45:00,1641," The contact page says ""JIM VAN RYN - OWNER/USA RETAILER SALES"" Are you sure they're Canadian? I guess I could contact Dave Chong and ask him."

On a side note, interesting thread Mr. Bailey. In your initial post though, Gatti fly rods aren't Canadian made, they come from Italy."
527718,Handlebarz,2010-12-12 14:15:00,3790,  Lew and yourself are right these are some of the best I have ever seen Tony had started making them again just before his wife got sicker then passed this year I dont know if he is going to give it another try or just stop for good I have not heard what he is doing I hope he keeps going.
527727,mbac31,2010-12-12 15:04:00,904,"Sorry, should have rephrased it. Nothing goes outside meant that its all made here. Sales are all over North America. They are all made and packaged here. Dave is in charge of Canadian sales and Jim takes care of the international sales."

503124,Dave Bailey,2010-09-12 00:58:00,1641,"When I started this I had no idea that there were so many manufacturers in Canada, and I find it gratifying. Many are small 'cottage industries', but that's fine, I would rather see my money go directly to a small business than some international conglomerate.  Now, I realise that it isn't possible for many of these to be 100% Canadian from start to finish, but I don't have the time and resources to determine where the iron was mined and smelted into steel, and where that steel was turned into a hook or a sheet from which a spoon pattern was cut. As long as the end product was basically manufactured here that's okay with me. Some, like Legend boats, I have left off because I am led to understand that it is only the assembly that is done here - that might be acceptable for a small garage operation but a major manufacturer has to do better than that for inclusion on my list. In the end it will often be a judgment call, and I am open to discussion. Thanks to all who have contributed so far, and keep supporting Canada!"
