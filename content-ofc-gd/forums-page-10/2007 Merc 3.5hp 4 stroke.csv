1080737,FLEX ROD,2022-06-17 20:00:00,394,"So I found a mer 3.5hp 4 stroke , it's a 2007 what would be a fair price? I  have a 18' square back is this a over kill? All suggestions are welcomed and appreciated. Thanks FLEX"
1080740,porkpie,2022-06-17 22:03:00,2521,"No, I ran one on a 16 foot sportspal wide transom and it was fine.  I had the Tohatsu version, but the Merc 3.5 is the same motor.  I think it will be fine on an 18 foot square back in my opinion, and it will go like hell too LOL.  The only concern I could see is if you have one of those really narrow little square sterns, and even then I’d guess it’d be ok as they aren’t very heavy."
1080749,FLEX ROD,2022-06-18 01:00:00,394,"Thanks for the info porkpie, I have a 1 year old sportpal with a nice wide stern. You are correct that it should go like he'll, I may actually get a chance to see the whole lake finally after 5 years. It's not a big lake but I was using my minkota  electric so speed was not really a option. Any clue what it's worth? FLEX"
1080750,Weeds,2022-06-18 02:10:00,782,"I picked up a like new 2018 Suzuki 2.5 for 500 for my sportspal, which I figured was a good deal. You might be  somewhere around that price point. I have the narrower flat back sportspal and actually managed to fall out when I stood up and leaned over the motor to check that it was pumping water out. Thought I was gonna tip the canoe so flopped out. Ruined my cell phone. Some weight up front would’ve really helped. Other than that it was good."
1080751,porkpie,2022-06-18 02:31:00,2521,I really don’t know.  I think I paid $650 for mine at the time in good used condition.  With the sportspal wide transom you’ll have no issues.  It will be a real nice rig to tour around in!

1080770,FLEX ROD,2022-06-19 12:47:00,394,"Thank you both, I was thinking around 750, so I hope to land somewhere in the middle. FLEX"
1080771,FLEX ROD,2022-06-19 12:50:00,394,"Thank you Weeds, I can't seem to find it,  must be gone. I looked for it last night because I would have bought that immediately. Many thanks, FLEX"
