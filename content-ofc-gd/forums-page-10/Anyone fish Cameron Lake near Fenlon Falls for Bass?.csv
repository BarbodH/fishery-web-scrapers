1080583,BillM,2022-06-08 16:40:00,17367,Check fish online and go explore?   I'm sure Google maps would be helpful as well.
1080599,Rizzo,2022-06-09 13:07:00,4754,I have never fished Cameron but there are several launches on Balsam. I think there is at least one launch in the narrows between the 2 lakes if I remember correctly

1080651,SlipperyVic,2022-06-12 12:04:00,11,"Haven't fished Cameron yet, but I do get my ass handed to me on Balsam on a semi regular basis.  I know a good launch on the west side of Balsam if you can't find anything on Cameron."
1080656,Raycaster,2022-06-12 14:22:00,528,"SlipperyVic don’t feel bad about Balsam, I have been fishing there yearly for many years and many hours and still go home empty many days. Every year seems different and I will stubbornly hit the “go to” spots 3 days straight for zero. And then I will lazely troll a walleye harness on the way back and hook in to a beautiful musky… It just seems to be that type of a lake. I do remember having a pretty successful day on Cameron right after the locks leaving Balsam with all those weed areas. I also see a charter guy posting weekly shots of big musky catches. "
1080671,AKRISONER,2022-06-13 21:38:00,5558,If you want to catch bass throw a whacky rig basically in any sparse weeds in 7-15 fow in southern Ontario and you are going to catch bass
1080677,Musky Plug,2022-06-14 16:57:00,398,"Friend of mine has a cottage down the river from Cameron. Fishes there regularly. Says there’s lots of bass there, and has managed to catch a few decent musky as well."
