Just prior to Covid I reconnected with my childhood friend and neighbour and now post Covid we finally managed to go fishing together, again after a 45 year gap. The fishing post cold front was not stellar but the day, the memories, the conversation.....well in short everything was quite special for both of us.  	While the post cold front Walleye would not come out to play with us, the Sheephead finally showed mid morning when the water warmed one full degree F*  	The post fishing trip ended with my usual stop at the Country Chip Wagon where my friend (Chris) was happy to treat me to a late lunch.  	For me it's never the fish count, it's the memories created and those revisited. 🙂  	Here's a few pictures from the day ending with my boy Gordie's second ever boat trip, exhausted as he was still wagging his tail with joy.
