1080399,Toronto_Angler,2022-05-27 20:36:00,698,  Finally did my bucket list trip this week and hit up Clearwater for the Tarpon run. My friend who runs charters told me to prepare for an A*s Kicking but I had no idea that he meant that literally! We went 2-6 bagging a 110 and 184 pound Tarpon that took 1 and 2.5 hours to haul in. Incredible runs and jumps from these beasts! After the 184 my back and hands had nothing left so we spent an hour casting for trout in the back channels lol. Incredible experience and cant wait to do it again when I recover lol https://youtu.be/zWiykLdbcNI
