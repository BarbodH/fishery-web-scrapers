1080775,Raycaster,2022-06-19 15:15:00,528,"I’m on Lake Ontario weekly now chasing Salmon/trout and have been bring a big cooler with me filled with ice to bring home the goods. Its fine but I only have a 16ft aluminum and it takes up space. I was babbling to my wife that a collapsible long cooler bag would be great and save space… well be careful what you wish for as guess what arrived for Father Day, yes the kids and her are awesome.  Anyways, just wondering if anyone else uses them and pros/cons etc. Im hyper about keeping the fish fresh so hopefully a bag of ice with this will keep everything good a few hours. Also, would you guys bleed them before or gut them etc? I could filet them quick on the boat and bring xl freezer bags to put the slabs in… As mentioned Im always thinking about bacteria etc. I’m only ever bringing home 1 or 2 fish… "
1080777,Terry,2022-06-19 17:23:00,14456,"If the fish is dead, I like to bleed them out"
1080778,Raycaster,2022-06-19 18:07:00,528,"So Terry, you would clip the gills while still in the water/net and then ice bag it? I have a livewell but its small and useless for salmon/trout."
1080779,Terry,2022-06-19 18:16:00,14456,"Yeah I would do it in the net and let it hang over the side for a while , it would make a mess if you did it in the bag or just put it’s head in the livewell with water in it. I find they bleed quicker in water"
1080780,Raycaster,2022-06-19 18:37:00,528,I usually do it in net/water. Boat would look like a murder scene if I did onboard.
1080781,CrowMan,2022-06-19 19:26:00,413,I bleed them out in a bucket with water...head first. Just a slit behind the gills. That seems to get it done quickly. Then immediately on ice.
1080782,porkpie,2022-06-19 20:41:00,2521,Your on the right track.  I’ve been bleeding my fish for 30 years.  Always better quality meat no matter the species!  Can you post a link to this cooler you got?  Even in an 18 footer the giant fish cooler gets in the way!

1080784,Raycaster,2022-06-19 21:22:00,528,Not a super expensive one but should do the job. on amazon.ca 
1080785,Terry,2022-06-19 21:34:00,14456,If it holds fish and ice it will do the job and I. time will tell you know long it will keep it cold.
1080786,dave524,2022-06-19 22:36:00,4508,I got a couple of cooler bags real cheap at Costco if you don't mind the Costco emblem on them
1080787,porkpie,2022-06-19 22:55:00,2521,Thanks for both suggestions.  Love that Costco logo too!
1080800,Raycaster,2022-06-20 16:42:00,528,"Ok, opened the package and… its huge, actually too big!!! 	I think this is good for the Wicked Tuna guys! I should of checked measurements as something maybe 2/3 the size would be good. Maybe if I fold the last flap in…Not sure what I will do with this, probably return.  Great quality doesnt feel cheap, just too friggin big. "
1080815,Raycaster,2022-06-21 13:27:00,528,"Returned, Amazon makes it pretty easy to return. Ordered this: 48” but hopefully manageable. Like the idea of a drain plug. If it comes early enough I will test out Thursday or Friday with any luck.    "

1080865,Raycaster,2022-06-23 19:57:00,528,"This looks way more manageable, again feels heavy duty so I will give it a try tomorrow! Not sure why first image upside down…"
1080890,Raycaster,2022-06-25 14:39:00,528,Not a super day but something for the freezer is always good. Bag was perfect.
