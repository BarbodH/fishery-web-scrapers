1080435,AKRISONER,2022-05-30 18:39:00,5558,ive always said the fish fly hatch is the end of the spring fishing bonanza. Its usually ok though because bass opens in a few weeks.
1080436,BillM,2022-05-30 19:18:00,17367,Time to break out the slow death hooks and small pieces of worm.
1080438,captpierre,2022-05-30 20:04:00,2521,I catch way too many panfish dragging a harness.
1080439,BillM,2022-05-30 21:16:00,17367,It's not a worm harness.   It's slow death.  Absolutely the presentation you want when the mayflies are hatching.
1080440,Terry,2022-05-30 21:39:00,14456,  Yup it seems to work when nothing else will during the hatch
1080441,Dara,2022-05-30 23:45:00,3052,OOD magazine just had an article saying the mayfly hatch is the bonanza if you know how to fish it and detailed how. It works for me. Feed them what they want and they will eat it  Slow death after a storm too.
1080453,TJQ,2022-05-31 14:38:00,7806,I would imagine they are coming soon to Nipissing then!
1080458,Dara,2022-05-31 20:58:00,3052,You know it TJQ  My daughter used to have to shovel them from the sidewalk
