1080395,limeyangler,2022-05-27 14:28:00,5204,My favourite time of year! I finish work at 8pm which gives me a good half hour to unwind at my dock. This time of year the walleyes are on in my bay for a couple of weeks. Nothing better than grabbing a bucket of minnows and a slip bobber and watching the sun go down.

1080467,akaShag,2022-06-01 16:17:00,2073,"They seem to be quite a pale colour, and I think I recall some summer pictures you posted, same thing.Â  Is it my eyes, or are those walleye a paler colour than elsewhere?  Doug"
1080468,Headhunter,2022-06-01 17:21:00,5703,I'd quit workin if that was my backyard! HH
1080477,limeyangler,2022-06-02 07:44:00,5204,"A good job too, I spend most of my time repairing the thing.  I donâ€™t take it for granted! Yes Doug, they are pale. The Goon(Wabigoon Lake) is the Color of chocolate milk, I guess it creates low light penetration and like cave dwelling creatures they have no pigment, same thing happens to gamer teenagersâ€¦ lol If only."
1080479,akaShag,2022-06-02 12:56:00,2073,as suspected.Â  I have seen this before with walleye and perch. Doug
