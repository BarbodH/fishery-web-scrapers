1077921,glen,2022-01-03 19:40:00,2641,Great looking fish.  I’ve caught a few but no where near that size.   	Now I want to get the boat out.
1077924,Rizzo,2022-01-04 02:14:00,4754,"wow super gross. No offense, just have never been able to get my head wrapped around catfish. Thankful that I never catch them myself, just have to unhook the odd one my kids deep hook. Either way, you do have some nice specimens there...just not my cup of tea!"

1077932,misfish,2022-01-05 14:30:00,29133,You eat them that big Art? Blacken catfish. Yum.
1080515,yakpiker,2022-06-04 14:02:00,160,"The cat bite has been been active on the Lower Mad this year since the opener...nothing bigger than last year's monsters, most of them between 7 and 10 pounds with a few exceptions.  This one was about 18 lbs unofficially, based on a 16 lber that was weighed.
