1077823,misfish,2021-12-26 16:17:00,29133,to me  Going to be a game changer when ever we get some ice. 
1077824,Terry,2021-12-26 16:40:00,14456,"Great, Does it  record "
1077825,misfish,2021-12-26 16:49:00,29133,"No,it,s a cheap model. LOL I will put my camera in front and record.LOL"
1077826,misfish,2021-12-26 16:50:00,29133,"It,s more for structure then fish watching. "
1077827,GBW,2021-12-26 17:35:00,8460,"Nice, I have an off-shore one for seeing what's below too. My new this year, an FXR float suit for me, FXR pants for the Mrs (her jacket was still a good floater), new CKX boots for all and a new Pelican 68 with cover and trailer bar. BRING ON THE ICE!"
1077828,porkpie,2021-12-26 17:46:00,2521,Best used for locating rocks and gobies!
1077829,misfish,2021-12-26 19:00:00,29133,Zebra muscle patches as well.
1077840,DanD,2021-12-27 20:43:00,2223,I'm jealous of the new camera! Had a cheap one off of Amazon that was supposedly rated for 100 feet. Worked great perch fishing in 15-20 feet. Was able to keep the drinks off the bait and bring the bait to the larger fish. The first time on Simcoe in 40+ FOW the camera lasted about a minute before flooding and burning out.  You'll enjoy the camera; I know I did as long as it lasted. Dan.
1077841,aplumma,2021-12-27 21:55:00,6896,Very cool that is a game changer up North where the water is clear enough to see stuff. Down South we have way to much silt and sediment for them to be viable. Art
1077842,Fisherman,2021-12-27 22:38:00,7201,"Same in some of the more northern ""tea stained"" lakes, might get to see 12 inches at 20 feet down."
1077846,Tjames09,2021-12-28 13:39:00,664,Cool. I had a marcum before. Really only worked on clear lakes like Simcoe. Was useless on northern lakes that are deep and dirty.
1080493,JasonHall,2022-06-02 22:48:00,1,"looks nice! I'm a huge fan of playing a variety of various games. Casino games were the last thing on my mind when I first started playing dota 2. Since I've earned the right to call myself a professional player, I've begun writing reviews of the greatest online casinos. Check out my reviews at Steeves250 and I'm sure you'll find them useful."
1080514,Rizzo,2022-06-04 13:16:00,4754,I used to have a camera...problem was I spent more time floating down the niagara looking for musky than actually fishing. Was quite fascinating.
