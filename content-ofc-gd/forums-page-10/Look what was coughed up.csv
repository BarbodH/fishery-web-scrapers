1080803,kickingfrog,2022-06-20 20:09:00,8333,Always neat to see what in their stomachs. In-fisherman magazine had piece recently about the size of prey that walleye eat and the gist of it was we're (walleye anglers) aren't using big enough baits even for 4 pounders let alone 8-10 lbs.
1080805,captpierre,2022-06-20 21:22:00,2521,Yeah. I always check. Of the 7 I’ve kept this year all stomachs were empty.
1080806,CrowMan,2022-06-20 21:35:00,413,For those who think a foot long bait is too big for Muskie... https://northernontario.ctvnews.ca/video-shows-northern-ontario-angler-catching-a-pike-just-as-a-50-inch-muskie-eats-the-pike-1.5759093 The thing I found most interesting was that he was using Lamprey for bait..
1080807,captpierre,2022-06-20 21:37:00,2521,I caught an big eye dragging a 10 inch Believer once. But typically fish small to medium crank baits and bucktail jigs.  	This one mid day today
1080808,Garnet,2022-06-20 23:23:00,2056,Never understood stomach contents. This Wally likes black and red buck tails. All the info nessary.
1080809,Rizzo,2022-06-21 00:52:00,4754,"I have caught many walleye on 8 to 12 inch musky baits. Most of the walleye have been in the 6 to 8 lb range, but the occasional smaller one"
1080823,misfish,2022-06-21 17:38:00,29133,I once counted 46 shiners and 7 gobies from one whitie fish. Eating machines. Then there are the ones that have nadda. Just mush from ground up zebras. Depends on the area I am fishing.
1080884,Barry Willis,2022-06-24 19:05:00,180,I'll never forget fishing for Splake on Georgian Bay. Most times we were catching them every cast at a depth of 40ft.  Almost every one was so full of smelt and not just one but several smelt were hanging out of their mouth as they didn't have room for them and still took our lures. Didn't matter what we threw at them. It's a shame they couldn't reproduce. One of the nicest eating fish I have ever had. Happy Days.
