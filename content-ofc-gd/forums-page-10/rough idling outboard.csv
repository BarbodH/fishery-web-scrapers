Seller started it after multiple tries. Seemed to work after it warmed up.  At home, started after about 5 pulls or so.. not bad.  In forward acceleration, the engine seems to perform well. In reverse as well... But, in neutral it idles poorly and dies after e few moments. It seems to shake and vibrate then almost backfires (if that's a thing with outboards?) I should try to post a video (if possible?).  Is this a carb issue?  BTW, I changed out the gas and bought Shell Premium and added Seafoam. Maybe if I leave it overnight, the seafoam will break down some of the guck? Should I change out the plug and clean the carb?             Thoughts?"

1080904,pics,2022-06-26 05:42:00,1268,Seafoam will only do so much.  The carb will probably have to be removed and cleaned.. one tiny piece of gunk will cause a poor running condition
1080908,siwash,2022-06-26 11:15:00,683,"okay, thanks... and what about spark plugs?"
1080909,Fisherman,2022-06-26 12:38:00,7201,"2 stroke, yes change the plugs."
1080920,AKRISONER,2022-06-27 02:19:00,5558,"New plugs, pull the carb and clean it right out with carb cleaner. good luck"
