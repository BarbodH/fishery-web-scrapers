1080407,lew,2022-05-28 18:33:00,12766,"Just got our power back on yesterday (Friday) and internet & landline (phone) finally got hooked up today. I've also got a cell phone but reception was poor. I've said it may times but my GENERAC standby generator is by far the best money I've ever spent. Just a few seconds after the storm hit and everything went out, the generator fired up and ran everything I needed in the house for 7 days and never hiccuped once. I shut it down a couple times just to check the oil but other than that it ran constantly & flawlessly. I've been around a long time and been thru plenty of bad storms but never saw anything hit that fast and nasty before. Wife and I took a walk when it was all over and I couldn't believe the number of massive trees snapped in half or torn right outta the ground and sadly a fella was killed by a falling tree just south of me. Hopefully all you boys made it through without too many issues.        "
1080408,ketchenany,2022-05-28 19:49:00,3229,Glad you are safe Lew. It came quick for sure. We lost power for a few hours. Never bothered starting the genny. Lots of roof and fence damage our way. My daughter in Brooklin lost her 10x10 gazebo and furniture at the bottom of the pool. The last storm 3 years ago the shed went in the pool!!!
1080409,lew,2022-05-28 20:37:00,12766,I just recently installed 2 steel roofed gazebos on my back deck and didn't remember till after the storm that I forgot to screw them down. I guess if they didn't go into orbit during that storm they never willÂ  LOL
1080410,Spiel,2022-05-28 20:45:00,9065,I'm happy that you and the Diane were prepared and of course both well in the afterwards Lew.
1080413,lew,2022-05-29 07:35:00,12766,"Thanks Chris, how'd you guys make out down your way ?"
1080414,Spiel,2022-05-29 11:09:00,9065,"Hamilton dodged the bullet Lew, we were at the very southern edge of the storm. 	It was a non event here."
1080415,Garnet,2022-05-29 11:36:00,2056,"http://Bowmanville very little damage. It was blowing rain so hard I could see my back fence 50-60 ft away. I've joked with wife we are on the same line as restaurants,CT,Wal Mart , main fire department ,police station. So hydro out for 2 hours no shingles lost no trees down.  Moving in couple months to Port Hope will miss this place."
1080416,ketchenany,2022-05-29 13:08:00,3229,My son in law is the GM at the CT and he suffered more damage up in Brooklin. 
1080430,pics,2022-05-30 12:34:00,1268,It sure came in quickly.. I was on break in our downstairs lunchroom so I missed the chaos ðŸ˜….Â  Everything turned black with coal dust before the rain started.. 
1080433,captpierre,2022-05-30 14:50:00,2521,Lucky here on north Pigeon. Minimal damage. Power out 3 days. Our son on the south edge of Ottawa just got his power back now.
1080454,TJQ,2022-05-31 14:39:00,7806,My buddy sells Generacs.. he cant keep up with demand.
1080482,MJIG,2022-06-02 14:27:00,227,"Iâ€™ll bet. In contrast to a Generac, it wasnâ€™t much fun filling a small generator every 8 hours around the clock from Saturday afternoon until Thursday for the fridge and freezer, but I will certainly take that inconvenience over the extensive damage that some others suffered. I heard that winds hit 120 to 130 km per hour in some spots close by. I donâ€™t think Iâ€™ve ever heard of winds at speeds that high in the Kawartha Lakes area before."
1080483,Terry,2022-06-02 16:05:00,14456,generacs are mostly natural gas or propane fueled
1080488,Whopper,2022-06-02 18:03:00,2174,"Lew good to hear your back up worked well. We are a Kohler and Generac Dealer both sell well. We could have used one last week in NWO, camp went down for a day but the catching made up for it"
1080494,Rizzo,2022-06-03 00:39:00,4754,Wow glad you guys are alright. Lots of damage for sure. Luckily no issues here in Guelph just power out a couple days
