1080821,georginaisle,2022-06-21 15:56:00,42,I    havs a trailer at happy holiday campground for the season and there are so many lakes around here! If anyone has fishing experience in the area id truly appreciate a pm and some specirs info for the lakes close by. I dont want to name any lakes cause i think its against the rules to ask info on small lakes on the general discussion Any info would be invaluable

1080851,the spirit of fishing,2022-06-22 20:29:00,141,Sorry to hear about your purchase falling through. I'm sure besides being painful financially you were extremely disappointed. Unfortunately I can't help with fishing info around Temagami. There are others on the board who I think are familiar with that area and hopefully they see your post and help you out.
