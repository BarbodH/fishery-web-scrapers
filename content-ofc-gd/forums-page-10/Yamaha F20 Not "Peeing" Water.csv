1080451,lew,2022-05-31 14:02:00,12766,Could be a spider nest in the tube which is very common. Take a piece of stiff mono leader and push it into the hole and that will quite likely fix your issue.
1080452,BillM,2022-05-31 14:08:00,17367,Thick mono or trimmer line up the pilot hole would be the first thing I do.
1080455,misfish,2022-05-31 15:24:00,29133,What they both said. I had this a few times and it was always a wasp buried in it.
1080456,sneak_e_pete,2022-05-31 15:43:00,540,Will give that a try tonight.  Thank you!
1080459,SlipperyVic,2022-06-01 00:08:00,11,My 30hp Johnson would constantly get a spider in the tube and I'd have to clear it out with a bottom bouncer. I started putting a golf tee into the tube every time I'm done with the boat and problem solved. 
1080464,tomO,2022-06-01 13:31:00,363,Thermostat? 
1080495,Rizzo,2022-06-03 00:43:00,4754,"some of these motors also have a thermostat. I thought I had a problem once because mine wasn't peeing out either...waited around 30 seconds and it started. That was in some cold conditions, gotta admit I was very nervous letting it run those 30 seconds!"
1080513,rockin-steelhead,2022-06-04 12:22:00,19,As others have said could be thermostat think there is a way to test the impeller if pull the lower end and are able to turn the shaft at a good speed.
