Water levels are higher than they've been since 1940 or something like that. The two docks that I put in last year are toast...as is the case for many people. Roads washed out, communities cut off...pretty savage. Ice was out late, two weeks late give or take a day, 15th of May. It went quick once it went (taking my docks with it) and the walleye are starting to appear in our bay and i got half an hour in after work on season opener this past Saturday from my broken dock/deck, keep mentioning the docks...lol...but its peeing me off.
