1080363,kickingfrog,2022-05-25 02:30:00,8333,Quick trip to Nipissing for the Saturday of the long weekend with my brother and son. Started calm and still and we got into a few fish. A few bass were found in the afternoon. We got into more fish at 5pm when it was still calm and then the wind picked up and we had some faster action. We were able to get our 6 fish limit and had a nice feed. Sunday was wet and we had to head back south for other obligations but some more bass were caught off the dock.

1080365,AKRISONER,2022-05-25 13:00:00,5558,i forgot about nip's whacky bass season. Catching them off of the dock? They are geared up and ready to go. That full moon mid june is going to be a firecracker with the cold spring weve had. Water temps were far too low up north to get things going on the last full moon.

1080368,kickingfrog,2022-05-25 19:41:00,8333,We can cast to 12 feet of water from the dock. Surface temps were 13.5-15.0 Celsius. We had a lot of talk about whether or not we'd keep any bass if the walleye bite was off. In the end we didn't have to make that choice.
