Just beautiful for fishing ( not so for catching   ) What a difference, we were few minutes late to catch the sunrise, but still it was worth to take a picture   I should not complain about fishing, because we still managed to land few pikes, but we were chased from one spot to another by very aggresive bass. For the first time on this lake I've hooked ( what I consider trophy for myself) approx. 5 lb SM. Released itself on the slack line about 3-4' from the boat. Some pike pictures:      The lake was very busy at times. Few more boats in 100 meters radius      On the end it was a pleasure to ( comparing last weekend ) be on the water.  Following the tradition two of the smaller pikes we've landed ( 7 in total ) were invited for fish fry contest  .  It is only four more days for the next weekend"
