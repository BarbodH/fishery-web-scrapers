206071,bow slayer,2008-05-25 18:53:00,1074,I am looking at buying a tent trailer from a private sale in Michigan. Does anyone know what cost is to import back here. I am guessing GST and a trailer permit. Is there any duty? If so how much(%). thanks for any help
206078,SlowPoke,2008-05-25 19:12:00,2984,Duty is only applied to merchandise made outside of North America and some categories are exempt. I would expect this tent trailer to be North American made so duty would not be applied. I'm not sure about GST but probably have to pay. Trailer inspection/registration is probably the same as importing a boat with a trailer. -Brian
