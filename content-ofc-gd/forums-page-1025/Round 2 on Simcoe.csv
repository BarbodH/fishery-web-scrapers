We tried all the spots that we hauled them in yesterday but the action was SLOW.  2 fish caught and we only had a few bumps.  So out we went in search!  We broke away from the pack and found some fish holding in about 80fow.  williams put most of our fish in the boat but the bad boy did well too.   It wasnt as good as yesterday but we did get our limit and also live released a few others!   back at my cleaning station "
