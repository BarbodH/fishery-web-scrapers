206013,Clampet,2008-05-25 16:52:00,1947,"Wall, my neighbour Niaz, began asking me all kinds of questions about fishing, in Canada as he is from Bangladesh.  He purchased a fishing license last long-weekend , and never fished here b4, so I thought, what the heck, let's go an try an accessible shore spot, mentioned here.  We got a line in the water by 3:50 P.M., and within 5 minutes fish on! A nice jumbo Perch.  Niaz became quite excited, at this, and soon after he caught one too.  The rest is history, we caught a total of 24, nice sized keepers, with a few double headers caught on our two hook pickerel rigs!      "

206287,mdniaz,2008-05-26 02:29:00,1,"Guys, this is Niaz. You know what? We did actually try some fish fries at a restaurant near our spot, but I must admit that Paul is the greatest. A meal with some roast potatoes and cooked veges; even my brother wants to go for fishing now  By the way, may be I was quite a bit lucky for my first day, but the credit goes to Paul too; he is a patient and a great teacher. Cheers Paul  what's our next plan??"
