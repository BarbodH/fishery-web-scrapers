206743,Pinch,2008-05-27 00:10:00,231, Where abouts are you?  I MAY have a spare one in my garage that you can have.  I will have to check when I get home.
206754,Billy Bob,2008-05-27 00:22:00,5865,"You also have to consider if you need a starting marine battery or a deep cycle marine battery. The deep cycle is used to power a electric trolling motor. Then you need to decide on what size you require. Most boats unless you have a very large outboard (100 hp and up) you should only need a group 24 starting battery. When it comes to deep cycle batteries get the largest you can fit in the battery compartment, there are Group 24, 27, 29 and Group 31 being the very largest battery.  Bob"
