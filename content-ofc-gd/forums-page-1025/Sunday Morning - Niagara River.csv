206512,dobee,2008-05-26 16:16:00,301,"Got out fishing Sunday morning hit the niagara river. From 7:30 to 10  we had no luck, ran into Paul from Cast Adventures around 10:30 , having time to kill before his afternoon appointment , the nice guy he is invited me and my friend Brian aboard for a good hour or so.  Brian and I have been out with Paul before so it was nice to get the chance to catch up while dropping a line in the water with him. We bought in 2 steelies, a sheephead, and lost 2 other steelies all within an hour.  From shore, the afternoon proved more productive then the morning, we landed 2 steelies and lost 2 . we landed the exact same steelie that we caught earlier (same missing pectoral fin and stubby tail) nabbed a nice 27â€ laker, A nice 4lb OOS smallie, sheepshead, and a pretty big sucker. All caught on minnows.  Getting on the boat for an hour made our day Paul…thanks again..  For anyone who wants to hit the Niagara, I highly recommend Paul at cast adventures , he’s a great guy, knows his stuff and gets you onto fish.  camera died as i turned it on... go figure...  heres a pic from home and one for team 2!      dobee"
