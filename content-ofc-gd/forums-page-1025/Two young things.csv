Had my line set up and sat down on my chair to watch the float for a few minutes in an isolated hole off Lake Huron when i hear this noise at my feet..  These little Canada geese gosling's had nestled up to my boot.    After looking around for their parents for a while, I picked em up and put em inside my raincoat,  shivering their little brains out. Within a few minutes they were fast asleep.  A short while later a guy i fished with a few times shows up. I show him the goslings in my jacket and he asks what I am gonna do with them. I was thinking of taking them to my friends farm just down the road when he said his wife is an animal rescue volunteer and if i was OK with it, he would take them to her.  No problem for me. They were all his. ( his wife called me later that day to reassure me that they would be looked after.) So much for the raccoons and fox's dinner this time.  splashhopper"
