206576,douG,2008-05-26 18:08:00,2693,"Dad, Warren, Marc and I, leave tomorrow for Wawa.  We will be flying into some remote lake outside of Pukaskwa on Wednesday morning for four nights at a one room cabin on a tiny brookie lake.  We will have boats and motors on two adjoining lakes as well.  We expect that since this is the only cabin in the area, we will find complete solitude, and lots of those pretty little feesh. I hope the 11  hour drive will be worth it.  Pictures and lies on my return.  douG"
