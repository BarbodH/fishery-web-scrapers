So we ended up fishing the eastern end of Twelve Mile Bay with zero results..  Had a follow from a big pike near the end of the bay but that was about it..  Called it quits at 12 and made a run to Severn River to finish off the day.  First cast on the Severn landed me a small pike, maybe 3-4lbs..  That was about it for the day..  Sunday, got up and hit Gloucester for a try at crappies(First time fishing specifically for Crappie) That didn't work out either, one small perch for our efforts.  I'm really sick of this crap weather, can we please have a week straight of warm weather?  Pretty please with sugar on top?  June 7th will not come soon enough!"
