205980,jwl,2008-05-25 14:22:00,1056,"good see to something like this turn out to be on the side of the boat owner..really 4 years is not that long of a time for cracks to start to appear on that part of a boat, they should back it up..and it is easy for someone to tell if you take care of a boat or beat on it even if you use it alot, my Legend is almost 5 years old and besides a bit of dock rash and fish slime on the carpet from winter steelie fishin..still looks pretty much new out of the box after a quick wipe down."
205986,Gerritt,2008-05-25 14:40:00,6129,Now that is what I would call service! Thank you for sharing this with the community!  Kudos to Alumacraft!!  G
205991,walleyedreamer,2008-05-25 15:04:00,101,"I tend to baby my boat every year. wash and waxed with premium marine polish with Teflon. if you seen the boat you think its one or two years old. and why not, you pay big buck for it, why not take care of it. just glad am not doing the work, windshield coming off all the gauges, marine radio i installed. and the bracket for the fish finder. "
205998,jwl,2008-05-25 15:58:00,1056,"nice ride  , I hear ya about taking care of a boat and the price, and average priced decent boat costs at least as much as a car. Hope everything works out good for ya at the dealership, great to see they are backing ya up on this one"

206179,Gerritt,2008-05-25 23:21:00,6129,"She is a good old motor, and was VERY lightly used, as you can tell!.. glad she pushes your 12'r around... but get on you're dealer to get the right boat to you!  PS.. I expect a full report w/ pictures containing some fish porn! LOL  G"
206653,Alumacraft,2008-05-26 20:47:00,139,They are the best boats on the market bar none. I've had my 165sc Magnum 5 years now and have never had one problem with it. I will be an Alumacraft owner for life.
206733,bigcreekdad,2008-05-26 23:53:00,546,I'm on my 10th season with my Magnum 165 tiller. Looking forward to another 10......great fishing boat!!

206770,Billy Bob,2008-05-27 01:03:00,5865,"There are a lot of good boats out there. With that said I am and plan on many more years on my 16' 4"" - 84"" beam - 39"" deep Grumman that is 23 years young this year.  I just realized I need a better picture of my boat"
