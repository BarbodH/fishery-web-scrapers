206689,fatherof3,2008-05-26 22:16:00,1769,congrats on your first
206694,splashhopper,2008-05-26 22:28:00,2931," I thought the same thing Kevin... now I KNOW what these guys ""see"" in em..  great fight... not as tough as a big rainbow,, but one helluva tug on the 10.5ft rod and 6lb test line !  No special skills required either  I caught this one and two more same size on a # 10 hook and bread ball Kneeded up real tight on a weightless line. I remembered the others here saying to let the carp take the bait and go with it for a bit before setting the hook. GOOD ADVICE as i got a little excited    on the first three hits I had.  lol  Give it a try man,,, they are FUN !"

Had two on.. one wrapped me right around a log.. had to cut the line... as he wasn't moving back second one ran straight under some brush on the opposite bank... got me all tangled up in them  How big were they?  i  But i do know, my daughter wants her own pole now and she thinks this was ""fun daddy"". when can we go again daddy ?  cool"
