We worked hard through the night, trying everything in our arsenal.  We fished skinny, we fished deep - we used copper, dipseys on wire, dipseys on braid, mono off the riggers, SWR off the riggers, 2 core, 5 core, 10 core, 18 core....spoons, flashers and flies, meat.......   Well, when the sun came up, it smiled on us - and we were rewarded for our hard work.   Going 6/8 by 10am, with a couple of teens....one is below.          Then, we started to get some weight with this lovely....complete with the 'Lew' smile!         Not to be outdone, Iceguy landed this 22lb hog.         Overall, a great time was had by all.....now we keep our fingers crossed for the $500!   :-)"
206084,Guest Johnny Bass,2008-05-25 19:22:00,0,Those are some nice Salmon. Great workout for the arms!
206095,walleyemaster,2008-05-25 19:39:00,325,very nice fish boys...how long did your arms strectch ...did they peel off a ton of line?
206144,iceguy,2008-05-25 22:17:00,341,The double header today had both fish with over 500 ft of line out. Couldn't believe they didn't cross the lines out there.
206156,Gerritt,2008-05-25 22:46:00,6129,Rod... I have got to get out there with you one day... sheesh.. all this salmon talk make me want to open a tin!  G
206257,fishindevil,2008-05-26 01:34:00,6254,"Glad to see your hard work payed off guys !!!!.  ..well done man...great looking salmon,i love the fight of those spring kings,in that cold water,theres nothing like it!!!!!....cheers nice pics too"
206261,jace,2008-05-26 01:41:00,472,"How about the different glow in the dark, light stick, etc lures.  did you have any of those in the water?"
206284,jediangler,2008-05-26 02:20:00,1923,"Nice job SS, congrats on the fish. You are really hardcore fishing all night."
206318,Mike the Pike,2008-05-26 03:28:00,3421,That last pic sure shows one very fat salmon.  So what happened all night until the bite turned on in the wee hours of the morning.  Maybe next just hit the water at 4am.  
206389,silveradosheriff,2008-05-26 12:19:00,1025," We ran a bunch of glow in the dark spoons, but no takers.     Just wanted to try it once, next time I'll sleep in to 3:30.  :-)"
206390,ccmtcanada,2008-05-26 12:19:00,7971,Great stuff!  Some great pics and real nice fish.  Staying out all night....I suppose you took shifts sleeping?
206499,silveradosheriff,2008-05-26 15:43:00,1025," Well, that was the plan - but it didn't play out exactly that way.....we discovered that Lake Ontario Salmon fishing and sleeping aren't very compatible!"
206528,Reef Runner,2008-05-26 16:48:00,981,Nice work out there.  At least you didn't wake up to rocking up against some guys shoreline. lol. Thanks for sharing.
206586,SlowPoke,2008-05-26 18:23:00,2984,"I've done a few ""all nighters"" and found it to be much better later in the season... late August into September. I never had to go too far from shore.. over 60-80 FOW. Even the great nights still had thier lulls between 2ish and 5ish. -Brian"
