First fish of the season, my first time catching a trout. my first time using waders. and this is my first time writing a report lol. Lets hope i get the picture thing down.  So i headed up north on the 115 a bit on saturday and my uncle has got some property. Im pretty sure its a stream off wilmot creek that runs through it, but it was beautiful. He happens to have a sweet lil honey hole sitting there, and i had it all to myself. I was surprised the fish were still there but it did go pretty deep. SO i slipped on the waders, and walked in...using an eagle claw hook, mono line, and worms with a splitshot...no float...the water was crystal clear. So it takes me an hour or two to feel the fish out and get my strategy down. tried a few things and lost 1 fish, due to trying to tighten the drag and it jumped (newb)...so i changed up to a small spinner and this was the first fish of the season :   She was a beaut...as i didnt have net, i landed it bare handed, and had to bring it up on the bank to get my camera : i wanted this one for the team. Unfortunately...didnt get a measurement...thinking maybe 21 -22 inchs? maybe 4 lbs dont know   but i did manage to get the team logo in. Next one i caught was a bit smaller, and i caught using worms. What a great fight he gave   After him i caught the monster. Probably 10 or 12 lbs...absolute beauty...fought her about 10 minutes...she did some insane aerial moves...and one good headbash, and she was free   (i love how they always swim back in full view to mock you lol) That was that for saturday and i went home and cooked the smaller trout up...so pumped didnt get any shots or weights  allwell  Sunday hit up Frenchmans for Pike > Nothing. Then the bluffs...Nothing. Did see a massive rainbow do a follow up on my buddies huge pike lure, but nothing else. Skunked, but a good lure wash and day outside...Licks burgers made it better And that was that... Im going to ALGONQUIN on Wednesday, and ill bring back a hefty report for yall!  Pachone"
