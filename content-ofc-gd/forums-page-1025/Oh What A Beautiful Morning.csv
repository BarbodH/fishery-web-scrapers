205999,Tarzan's Jane,2008-05-25 16:03:00,1183,"Well...I finally got my nerve up and went out on my own.  This is where I went...view from my balcony.  As I'm walking to the water I hear ""haha Nancy...what do you think you're doing"".  I responded with ...  ""getting breakfast"".    So there I am fishing...I can feel nibbles...lost one lure to a snag...more nibbles...lost a lure to the darn fish...I'm thinking it must be real BIG.  I sit...re-tie...can hear more hassling from my friend Erika...""no luck Nance""  ""haha"".   I'm thinking...just wait...I'll show ya.  30 minutes later...after a few more nibbles...""Fish On"".   Geeezzz instant heart race.    So I yell..""Hey Erika, I got one!! come give me a hand"".  So happy she did come...I had never taken a fish off the hook...then I'm getting nervous about the time the fish is out of the water...have to take pictures...don't forget the OFC sign...oh crap the measuring tape...now I have to hold it too...and then the release.     Erica does the release...come on fishy, breathe...   My friend Erica...say what girl...haha  I hear a male tenant say...""did she really get one""  haha....Yeppers I really did...an 18.5"" pike...my first pike"

And seriously this woman has a chest on her bigger than dolly herself......LOL.......wears a very very low v necked leather top and likes to stand with one leg up wearing white leather thigh high boots on her seat, bent over and basically polishes her tank all day.......LOL......  I get such a larf watching the men all standing around like little puppy dogs with there tounges all hanging out and i am sure they're tails are wagging too.....LOL.  Gotta love FRIDAY THE 13TH........lol"
