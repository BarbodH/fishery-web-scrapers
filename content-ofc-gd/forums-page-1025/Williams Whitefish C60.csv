This is the common vertical jigging spoon for Simcoe whitefish.  I use it for lead core trolling for lake trout.  I cant find it in any of the large retailers eg BP, Can Tire, LB.  They have the larger C70 and wablers.  Some smaller stores have them but seem to sell out fast.  Anyone see these spoons for sale in the GTA-GTA north area?  BTW -Haliburton area water was 9-10C, lots of black files and the trout I caught were down 40-50 feet.  Dont know if they were shallow already or havent come up yet."
