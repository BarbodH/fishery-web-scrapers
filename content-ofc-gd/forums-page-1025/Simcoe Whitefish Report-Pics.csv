206230,spoonman,2008-05-26 00:45:00,103,"The weather was perfect, and I think anyone who owned a boat today was on the water. There was a huge fleet of boats out there today.   The crowds did not bother us a bit, we managed to finally get on to some good whitefish and limit out in no time. The Eagle Graph today was key to finding the fish. The Whitefish put up a great fight at this time of year. The action was fast and furious for us with most the action in the am.   Fish On     Derek fighting fish  My limit for the day   Cheers Al"
206234,Cudz,2008-05-26 00:51:00,2652,Where were you? Not far from the alcona launch?  I think I saw you out there last saturday when it was windy and crappy out.  Your boat and my boat were pretty much the only ones around late in the day. Nice fish.  What were you using?
206239,Sebastian,2008-05-26 01:02:00,208,haha Darek gets em again   Nice work. Darek you missed some good stuff with us today though. We learned a few new things lol
206248,fishindevil,2008-05-26 01:17:00,6254,Nice catch guys !!!!!!..  .great day to be on the water too.....cheers
206253,iceguy,2008-05-26 01:21:00,341,Whitefish are for the winter when you can't get the kings Al.   Nice fish glad you got in to some.
206254,limeyangler,2008-05-26 01:21:00,5204,"wow...looks like a perfect day in those pics, glassy water, bit of swell, and fish!!! some nice size to those whities too.

206277,tbayboy,2008-05-26 02:05:00,1497,"Congrats Al, nice job out there.  We were in that crowd somewhere as well but didn't fare quite as well (electronics problem - I'm sticking that excuse)"
206290,Mike the Pike,2008-05-26 02:41:00,3421,Wow can't believe the crowds on the lake hope tha launch wasn't like that.  Nice whitie pics
206295,spoonman,2008-05-26 02:47:00,103,There were a few boats to say the least. I've never fished anywhere with that many boats but I would love to line up at BOCA GRAND for the TARPON.  Good to see people out enjoying the nice weather. Cheers AL
206345,Chuck Best,2008-05-26 08:05:00,308,We stayed at the west end of the crowd till we got ours also......TC and tight lines....Chuck.... 
206357,TroutnMuskieHunter,2008-05-26 11:20:00,1362,Those are some nice lookin' whities
206360,ccmtcanada,2008-05-26 11:22:00,7971,Great report and pics!  I have yet to get into a whitefish...heard they smell like cucumbers....LOL.
206382,Spiel,2008-05-26 12:06:00,9065,"....Good stuff Al and Chuck. I didn't fare as well, man I marked steady fish all day but only had four hits and landed two. Julie, my GF being a rookie said she felt something (?) on a half a dozen occasions but never connected. I did venture to the west of the pack Chuck thinking you'd be in that area but never saw you. Al you were anchored fairly close to me at one point.   Did you all notice the boats out there....LOL"
