Did an hour long drift across the lake in 10-15km/h breeze. Picked up 5 pike on drift and two fishing the bay out of the wind. All were caught on Blue Fox spinner #4 in firetiger. This one was the last of the 7 fish and was 28"" long. Sadly, the biggest of three trips for pike.  Of course the wind picked up to 20-25km/h for my paddle back across the lake. If I catch any more pike it will be accidental as I'll now target crappies next week and then Musky opener the following weekend. Add a walleye trip or two and the next thing you know, Bass will be open."
206379,Victor,2008-05-26 12:01:00,1609,Nice pike! It looks like a storm's rolling in or something ... the sky's so dark for that time of the day.
206385,lew,2008-05-26 12:10:00,12767,"Thanks jedi, that's a great picture & I always enjoy reading about your ""yak"" adventures  Good luck with the upcoming musky season."

Make sure the Gadget gets at least one OK? The weeds are definately on the rise now. Had most of my luck near where we were last time in the dead heads. Good luck Bro."
