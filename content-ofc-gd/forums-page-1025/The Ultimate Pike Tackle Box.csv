Mid way on the page there are the other catagories of lures highlited in blue.
206136,jwl,2008-05-25 21:50:00,1056,"Well um let's see...all kinds of stuff works for me depending on location, time of year, water clarity, temps ect...  Xraps   Husky Jerks   Walleyedivers      spinnerbaits   and of course spoons     So it's hard to pick just one thing, these are just examples of a few fish I caught over the last year, as you can see....all these lures work for me"
206163,HTHM,2008-05-25 22:57:00,4082,"Red devils, the real ones ."
206203,MCTFisher9120,2008-05-26 00:06:00,3761,Where can i get the real ones?
206205,danbo,2008-05-26 00:11:00,2646,Black buzzbait.
206231,bucktail,2008-05-26 00:45:00,1857,"Large husky Jerk in Tennessee Shad has been the hot bait this spring. Have got 3 fish over 36"" on it....it's now toast so I had to buy 2 more. Xrap in perch a close second. Water is so cold this spring you need a neutral suspending bait that can stay in there face for a bit to trigger strikes."
206244,mepps,2008-05-26 01:11:00,1301,"my favs are Rapala X-rap, Johnson Silver Minnow, Mepps Black Fury #5 with chartruse dots, Mepps Aglia (green/yellow/orange)any frog like surface lure, and Rockstar spinner baits!     "
206291,holdfast,2008-05-26 02:42:00,1813,My choice for Back lakes and my trunk      
206311,Mike the Pike,2008-05-26 03:11:00,3421,Mike use.  Mepps Gold or Silver and Red.  X-Raps Pink is amazing as well as the perch pattern.  Husky jerks  Red or charteuse spinner baits.  Try a pause and retrieve method with the Rapalas.  Good Luck.
206316,danc,2008-05-26 03:26:00,4677,You can catch a Pike on anything. I'd be more interested in a tackle box of stuff that you can't catch Pike on.  
206322,Cudz,2008-05-26 03:33:00,2652,You can add big swimbait to the list (soft or hard) I was in Alberta last summer and was crushing pike on black Booyah Boogie baits (chatterbait). Lipless cranks work as well.  i remember a couple of times in Manitoba I outfished some local using a really long rattling spot.  They don't make them anymoer I think it was called a rattlin spot minnow or something. Pike will go after anything.  I caught one the other day on a spinner worm harness with a juicy crawler trailing. I have also caught several by accident on twin tail mister twisters.
206332,jace,2008-05-26 04:05:00,472,"the only consistent performers for me have been spoons.  I fished pike more than anything else up to the end of highschool because the were close to where I lived.  eppinger ""daredevles"" in either red or black.. they have long slender body rather than the rounder more oval shape that imitations have  Lucky Strike or Eppinger ""redeyes"" spoons with the 2 plastic ruby eyes,  standard silver Williams,  5 of diamonds from either Len Thompson or Eppinger"
206397,cranks bait,2008-05-26 12:38:00,721,I can't help you.  Alll the lures that I used last year to catch big pike are not producing this year.  I've only caught one and it was on a teeny little white spinner bait.   Although they are working great at catching bass right now
