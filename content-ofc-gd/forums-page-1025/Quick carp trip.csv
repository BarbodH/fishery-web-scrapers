205962,Marko,2008-05-25 13:31:00,854,"After i was done replacing my brakes and rotors on my car, decided to test them. Thats why i wasnt able to go to up to Credit and meet up some with some ofners, sorry guys. Decided to go to a local spot on Conesotogo river, havent fished Conestogo in ages but decided to try anyways. Needed to catch a carp and a sucker for team 6 so we can get some inches. I managed one of them. When i first got there, i was standing on the bridge and it was nice to see fish swimming around.   There were buncha carp and suckers swimming around and a lone pike, wasnt very big about 20-23 inches, wouldnt bite my corn lol. Some more snapshots off the bridge  Also there was a huge and really fat mirror carp that i tried to get to bite but wouldnt for the life of it. Its funny the fish would go up to suckers and attack them when they were just sitting there, never seen anything like that before. I`ll get him next time tho, i did manage couple of others tho. here is a first one:  27 inches long, 16 inches thick in grith, not a bad fish to start the day. I hooked him of the bridge and my friend had to help me land it while i went down to the river with the net for quick couple of pics and a quick measurement, and back in the water it went.  Couple of casts later i had the second and the third fish on and managed to pull them out myself. They were  smaller ones, as i had them on the shore I realized that the batteries in my camera had died, so had to use my cellphone to snap couple of pics.   Missed two more good hits and as we were getting ready to go home, I drop my appartment keys right in the water, friend was laughing thinking i have to go for a swim lol. I had some other ideas. it wasnt very deep so i tied on a trebble hook and after about 10 tries manage to snag them, curious fairly big small mouth swam by to see what i was doing. As i am trying to snag my keys i wondered what if CO came by and saw me fishing with a treble hook, would i get in trouble? I am prety sure if he saw the keys on the bottom he`d understand but you never know. And yes my car is stopping ok again and there is no more shaking when trying to stop on higher speeds. Thank you guys for reading."
205965,Mike the Pike,2008-05-25 13:42:00,3421,WTG Marko more inches for the team 27 inches that is a nice sized carp  Now you need to find a place to keep your keys safe.  All right I think we have 4 fish registered now  Keep up the good work.
206024,MJL,2008-05-25 17:16:00,2427,"Great work Marko.  Loving the pics.  That river looks prime for some decent carp.  In the first few pics, how deep is the water?  Do you have any polarizing lens on your camera?"
