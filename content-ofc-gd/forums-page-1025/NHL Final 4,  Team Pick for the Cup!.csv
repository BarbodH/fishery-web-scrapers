202832,Stoty,2008-05-17 10:41:00,2910,Still a little bitter about your pictures being modded I see. LOL  And to answer your question....shoulder injury stopped me from playing. I was being scouted by a number of OHL teams at the time.
202836,danbo,2008-05-17 10:46:00,2646,Actually I kinda like ya!     Just don't get why you criticize these athletes with such loathe? Survivor's guilt maybe?
202862,lickmyarmpit,2008-05-17 13:21:00,359,The wing and the wheel !!!!!!!!!!!!!! 
202877,Stoty,2008-05-17 14:37:00,2910,"I am just giving my opinion, which I am entitled to. I dont sugarcoat anything.  I like Crosby..he is one of the best players in the game, no doubt about it. Very skilled. He just needs to stop his whining every time he gets hit. Its sickening to watch. Hitting is part of the game, especially in Canada. Why does he think he should get special treatment? Look at Ovechkin...highly skilled, and throws his weight around and NEVER yaps after getting hit.  GO WINGS GO!!!!!"
202879,lickmyarmpit,2008-05-17 14:52:00,359," Same with malkin and iginla, i couldn't agree more crosby is a wicked skilled hockey player but someone should get him a pacifier."
202884,danbo,2008-05-17 15:42:00,2646,Stoty I feel the same about  Jagr!
202892,Stoty,2008-05-17 17:43:00,2910,Jagr you mean? I agree. Big time panzy.
202912,xrap,2008-05-17 21:14:00,683,stars 2-1 game 5 gg.
203820,MCTFisher9120,2008-05-20 18:32:00,3761,"Yup the final is about to start(Saturday). As before im sticking with the Pens, my call is going to be 6 games with the Pens on top. Any other opinions on the FINAL"
203825,Stoty,2008-05-20 18:35:00,2910,I am sticking with my prediction before the playoffs even started....DET/PIT Final = DET in 6  Gonna be a heck of a series!
203826,danbo,2008-05-20 18:36:00,2646,Any Wagers?
204223,Chris,2008-05-21 10:56:00,405," Yup, what he said.  Go Pens Go"
204258,Stoty,2008-05-21 12:30:00,2910,"Believe it or not, I read in the paper today the Pens are actually quite the underdog according to all the oddsmakers.  Det to win the cup - $1.60 Pit to win the cup - $2.40  Most of the ""professional"" analysts are taking Det in 6 or 7. Mind you....they also said ANA or SJ would win the cup."
204354,lookinforwalleye,2008-05-21 16:45:00,4399, Habs in six!!!!!
204360,danbo,2008-05-21 17:02:00,2646,
206356,MCTFisher9120,2008-05-26 11:14:00,3761,Uh oh Pittsburgh is down a game. I guess Detroit should get their 2 wins now so we can come back with 4
206378,Stoty,2008-05-26 12:00:00,2910,"Pittsburgh better show up tonight, or else they might be in trouble. I didnt get to see the game Saturday, but from the highlights I saw, they were totally dominated.  Det even had yet another goal called back for ""apparent"" goalie interference. What a bunch of crap the refs are this season.  Lets hope they dont ruin the series like they have a few times this year.  Gonna be a great game tonight I reckon."
201782,MCTFisher9120,2008-05-14 22:15:00,3761,So what are you waiting for pick your team.
201783,nancur373,2008-05-14 22:17:00,1211,But it will all come down to goaltending.
201795,workwear,2008-05-14 22:29:00,592,go pens go!!!  but it will be a good final....wings and the pens.....a tough call between them both......heart is with the pens....but money is on the wings.....
201796,danbo,2008-05-14 22:31:00,2646,Momma says PENS all the way!!
201980,Stoty,2008-05-15 02:25:00,2910,Momma is wrong!
201998,danbo,2008-05-15 03:10:00,2646,
202036,MCTFisher9120,2008-05-15 10:54:00,3761,"Why would people vote for Phili, it'sot gonna happen for them. They might.....""MIGHT"" win on more but the round is over tonight."
202173,danbo,2008-05-15 15:53:00,2646,I loved the Flyers back in the 70's..The Broadstreet Bullies ruled!
202175,danbo,2008-05-15 15:56:00,2646,
202176,danbo,2008-05-15 15:59:00,2646, Dang  I'm gettin' old already!
202177,Stoty,2008-05-15 16:01:00,2910," How can they win one, if the series is over tonight??"
202178,danbo,2008-05-15 16:03:00,2646,How old are ya Stoty?
202188,Stoty,2008-05-15 16:14:00,2910,26
202194,danbo,2008-05-15 16:19:00,2646,Shucks you weren't born when they were kings!  You prolly never knew Mr.Bill either..  
202201,Stoty,2008-05-15 16:26:00,2910,"I just asked how he thinks PHI might win one game, yet says the series will be over tonight as well. Doesnt make a whole lotta sense.....  P.S - I know about the ""Broadstreet Bullies""."
202207,Pinch,2008-05-15 16:35:00,231,  Because YOU gave them that option in the vote!  lol
202231,blaque,2008-05-15 17:11:00,2419," Bang on, i was scratchin my head over that one too"
202233,blaque,2008-05-15 17:12:00,2419," Also, Bang On......didnt get that either........whut Duh?"
202313,MCTFisher9120,2008-05-15 19:48:00,3761,"Ya there is a chance Phili can win the series...is it likely no. But as thet are still a part of the final four i thought i would include them...Look at The toronto maple leafs they came back from a 3-0 series and won, same goes for vancouver."
202332,steve_paul,2008-05-15 20:37:00,658,"OK, did the person who voted for Dallas do it just to pi$$ of Stoty"
202350,JohnF,2008-05-15 21:17:00,3494,Looks like the Detroit voters (like me) are coming out of the woodwork. Perhaps still shellshocked from last night.  One of them musta voted for Dallas in error?  JF
202463,Stoty,2008-05-16 01:27:00,2910," hahahah  Naw, I got a good laugh over it actually. Anyone who thought Dallas had a chance against DET needs their noodle checked!"
202703,MCTFisher9120,2008-05-16 19:59:00,3761,"Ya that was pretty dumb...but hey it has happened, I don't Detroit is overly good anyway, i mean they are almost always top 3 in their confernce but never really make it through. Not starting anything but they could do better in the playoffs if they really wanted to. Looks like there not gonna win the cup this year either. Lets go Pens!"
202734,Stoty,2008-05-16 22:35:00,2910,lol.....we'll see what happens.  Crosby needs to stop crying about every little thing though. wow. Everytime someone touches him he gets all pissy and complains to the refs. Give me a break.  And just what was Therrien thinking last night to put Crosby's line out (after the fight) with about 30 seconds left?????? Meanwhile he has Laraque and Ruutu sitting on the bench. He is stupid?? Look what happened!! Man oh man....give your head a shake man.
202735,danbo,2008-05-16 22:43:00,2646,"Yo Stoty,How come you aren't in the NHL?"
