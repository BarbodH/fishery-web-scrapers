310948,T.Barry,2009-02-26 00:27:00,24,"I second the Fox M alarms.  I've had mine for 5 or 6 years and still going strong.  I also built my own pod out of copper tubing and bank sticks and it works just fine.  Carp are a great filler between trout and bass season.  Once you learn to get them on the pod try the fly rod 100 times more exciting, and I've got my biggest (mid 30's) sight casting big leech patterns to these tailing ""golden bones""."
310984,Fang,2009-02-26 01:31:00,1330,Scorpion Tackle on the web has all of their pods in stock. From $39.99 up to $180  I bought my bite alarms off ebay. Paid $30 for 2 and they've worked great. Adjustable alarm and volume control. Take 9V battery and have never changed since they went in.
311110,Victor,2009-02-26 13:41:00,1609,"I'm not really sure whether you will see alot of carp stuff at the sportsman show. I went to the Spring Fishing Show 3 weeks ago and there was litttle to none ... only Natural sport (it was either Natural sport or JB, not exactly sure) had a couple of Technium rods (2.5-3lb TC) there for $150.  It's probably a better idea to pay a visit to the Hamilton area."
311119,MJL,2009-02-26 14:19:00,2427,"If you have no reservations on buying something without seeing it, most House of Hardy dealers (Like Natural Sports in Kitchener or Withafly in Mississauga) can order you Chub or Greys rods – They use the same supplier out in B.C. (Highfields).  Greys and Chub are subsidiary companies owned by House of Hardy http://www.chubfishing.com/en-gb/home/ http://carp.greysfishing.com/en-gb/home/  I personally don’t know any Hardy sales reps or store sales guys in Ontario who know much about the carp product line.  If you have any technical carping questions, you’ll probably have to search for the answers yourself on the net.  The Chub Outkast carp rods offer brilliant performance for the price of around $125…I might even say the ones I used had an even smoother action than my Shimano Technium."
311373,web-fisherman,2009-02-27 09:38:00,54,  Does it really? I have to give that a shot
311413,love2fishhave2work,2009-02-27 13:27:00,212, http://www.canpages.ca/page/ON/milton/lobl...re/4343238.html  You can't go wrong with simple off the shelf corn ath Loblaws (Peaches and Cream is the secret brand).
311939,pxtyson,2009-02-28 18:34:00,21,I went to Bronte outdoors last night and picked up some carp things. I got a pack of hair rigs that where so tangled I had to cut the hooks and swivels off to make my own My fault I am a clumsy man  Now I just have to wait for the ice to clear  Says the die hard ice fisher  I went thru the ice last saturday so now am just looking forward to the bank fishing
312258,spinnerdoc,2009-03-01 15:59:00,556,"in terms of carp bait have you tried making your own? i get my stuff at bulk barn. they have all sorts of corn meal and flour and brans that you can kinda experiment on, just be creative and think like a fish... oils and essences they have as wel. dunno what your budget is but i use a 9' trollong rod ugly stick with a baitrunner on. rod is 45 bucks i think. i got my strike indicator at angling specialties in mississauga...39 bucks i think the rod pod i am making myself, i am just lucky bec i work at a machine shop i am currently making it. i'll post it when i am done,  i only get to it when i have time.  there you go bud...carp fishing is addictive. best of luck to you and tight lines"
312273,BillM,2009-03-01 16:18:00,17367,"A little off topic question for the carp guys...  Do any of your fav shops carry Drennan mono?  I've noticed that it's quite popular across the pond for carp.  I'd love to rig up my centerpin with it, but have had zero luck finding any..."
312280,Photoz,2009-03-01 16:30:00,792,"About the only chance I think you MIGHT have would be at Fishing World in Hamilton. Jeff Vaughn at Long Sault apparently is 'carp central,' but I don't have his information."
312284,MJL,2009-03-01 16:47:00,2427," I think Tightlines in Pickering and FishOnline in Toronto might have carried a few spools of Drennan a while back.  It's worth a shot to call them to see if they might have some in stock.  Looking at the Top Mix Baits carp and match fishing catalogue as well as the Anglers International web-site, it doesn't look like stores in the GTA have access to the Drennan mono (only the fluoro leaders).  I know Jeff at the Long Sault motel carries products from ESP.  Drennan and ESP are pretty much the same company.  You might have luck getting a few spools through him.  It's best to contact him soon, the shipment of carpy goodies leaves England later this month."
312285,BillM,2009-03-01 16:48:00,17367,"Thanks guys, I appreciate it!"
312297,bassjnkie,2009-03-01 17:31:00,1101," Mike, bad news. FishOnline is no longer open or even there. The store was gutted a couple months ago. But Fish Ontario on hwy 400 (905.832.4566) has some ground bait and don't quote on this, a few Drennan items.  Jeff will be the best person to contact, 1.613.534.2546 as mentioned.  Another option for Drennan items is Ebay.co.uk, the exchange rate is in our favor, I mean a lot lower than what it was. Make sure the seller ships to Canada, not all of them do."
310755,pxtyson,2009-02-25 17:39:00,21,I am looking for a store as close to milton that I can buy some carp bait from. I have searched the net and have come up with nothing.  Any ideas? I am looking for boilies and other items. I have never carped before and really want to try it.
310759,T.Barry,2009-02-25 17:48:00,24,Bill's Bait Hamilton (Upper James St.) Fishing World Hamilton (Barton St.) Burn's Tackle Burlington (Plains Rd.)  All 3 sell carp stuff Boilies etc...
310760,pxtyson,2009-02-25 17:55:00,21,thank you very much for the info I will make sure to check them out.  Who would be the best to talk to at the sportsman show about carp rods? I am looking at picking one up but need some advice.
310763,Fang,2009-02-25 18:10:00,1330,"Bronte Outdoors, just south of Bronte and QEW increased his line up of carp gear and should be adding as summer comes through. He has ground and boilies there too. Fishing world has the best selection and has brought in some European corn - all kinds of flavors."
310772,MJL,2009-02-25 18:23:00,2427," In terms of carp rods at the show, Fishing World (if they are there) usually has a small selection of Shimano carp rods in their booth.  If Peter is there, he'd probably be the best person to walk you through your options if you're looking for a sales guy.  Bill's Bait and Tackle was mentioned as a place to get stuff but also have a look at: www.wackerbaits.com  Bill's can get you stuff from wacker baits without the shipping or customs if you ask.  Angling Specialties carries the Shimano Alivio carp rods for around $55-$60.  If you don't mind doing mail order, you can order stuff from the Long Sault motel.  Jeff Vaughan is a great guy to deal with if you're looking for specialty carp items from the UK - You also don't have to pay additional customs.  He's offered me great service in the past and he also smuggled over my bait to the States when we fished a tourney together last year."
310776,The Urban Fisherman,2009-02-25 18:32:00,2050,"if you just want to try it out first, go to the grocery store and buy a can of corn for under a buck and you're good to go for bait!    I've tried boilies and making my own corn mix from cows corn but a plain hook covered with sweet corn has always been the best bait for me... I've always fished water that was loaded with hungry, non-pressured fish though...  cheers, UF"
310780,pxtyson,2009-02-25 18:40:00,21,thank you very much for the great info I have a 10 foot noodle rod I was gonna try out first for carp but it is pretty light compared to what I have seen on the internet The rods for carp make my noodle rod look like a coat hanger
310783,nautifish,2009-02-25 18:47:00,1416,Yup if you do a Google search For carp recipie baits you will find lots of great info on how to make your own....Or as someone suggest just buy a can corn....How ever i like to use old stinky garlic sausage works a treat for me. The carp you see me holding on my avatar was caught with Garlic sausage.
310786,Photoz,2009-02-25 18:58:00,792,"A good limber 'noodle rod' is great for carp . .    with 6 pound line, as long as ya have half a day to get 'im in!! If you can't find an actual 'carp' rod . . .    a 10' to 12' rod . .     10 to 25 pound line rating will do nicely. Good choice of fish to go after . . .    a great place to start is down at the mouth of the Credit, west side, in about 5 to 6 weeks! See ya there!  This 34 pounder at the Credit in early April 06 is my best yet!  Hey Nauti . . .    when you kiss a carp, doesn't that garlic breathe turn you right off? (Heh . .   heh!)    "
310787,MJL,2009-02-25 18:58:00,2427,"My dad and I used noodle rods, steelhead/salmon rods, steelhead float rods for years for carp.  I still use my 10' salmon/steelhead rods for stalking carp.  Play the angles right and you can land a pretty hefty sized fish within 10-15 minutes.  They are obviously not the best choice for casting heavy weights, feeders or for landing fish in fast flowing or snaggy water.  Here's my dad reefing back with my old noodle rod. "

310817,diggyj,2009-02-25 19:42:00,548,"Wondering if anyone has ever tried this and if it works?  I was watching Jimmy Houston Outdoors recently and he said that the best carp bait in the world is Wheaties and Strawberry Soda Pop. He said to soak a bunch of Wheaties with Strawberry Soda Pop in a bowl and then once moist, make a ball and bait the hook.  I have never fished for carp, so I have no clue about bait, I have heard of using canned corn.  Dirk"
310821,hammercarp,2009-02-25 19:48:00,964,That's a popular bait in the southern states.
310874,web-fisherman,2009-02-25 21:16:00,54,"OK - I have a carp / Catfish bait that works in every lake, pond, river etc.  Its a little expensive but works. Buy a dozen RAW shrimp and a jar of chopped garlic and oil. Take another jar and mix the shrimp and garlic oil togather and put in the refrigerator until used. When you go fishing, Remove the shrimp with a fork and put them in a baggie. Sprinkle a good amount of garlic salt on them and your off.  Im telling you, It works like an absolute charm.  The catfish are addicted to this and so are the carp."
310888,sandybay,2009-02-25 21:45:00,64,I used to work with a guy from North Carolina and they made balls from flour and kechup for carp.

310920,hammercarp,2009-02-25 23:09:00,964,They're called bite alarms. Check out the stores I listed for them. Give'm a call.
310923,rbaquial,2009-02-25 23:14:00,968, Thanks Hammer! Any idea what the price ranges are? cheapest? most expensive?
310933,MJL,2009-02-25 23:34:00,2427," In Toronto, tackle shops supplied by KTL should be able to get you an alarm made by Wychwood – You’d probably have to ask them first if they are.  Angling Specialties in Scarborough had 1 alarm for sale earlier this year.  FishOnline at Jane and Lawrence might have alarms and pods in stock – If they don’t, they might be able to order pods for you from FOX (You most likely will have to wait a while for it though)  In Ontario you can get rod pods from (In no particular order) - Long Sault motel - Bill’s bait and tackle - Fishing World"
310938,MJL,2009-02-25 23:46:00,2427," Most Expensive (and most functional + available in the current market) - Delkim TXi plus - $190US each (optional remote receiver = $225US)  Most expensive (for the hell of it) - Nash stainless based on a Parsons/Neville design - I've seen them go for the equivalent of $450 each at auction (rare item today)  Cheapest - I've seen various ones on ebay for $10 (no name brand)  Best value alarm at a value price (IMHO) - FOX M or MX series  ($55 to $85) or the Delkim EV series ($85US)   With that said, my main alarms are FOX EOS-X alarms and I love them."
