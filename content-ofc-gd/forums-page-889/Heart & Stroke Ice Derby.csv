Sadly I was not one of the winners. My spot was where all the dink perch were feeding.  Regardless, it was a great day.  I got a great kick watching 3 young boys in our group, 2 who have never been ice fishing. Those young lads had a blast on the ice. I was glad to help them out and bring a couple of rods for them to use. This young lad had his very first ice caught fish. One of a few today.   This teen got this one as it was dragging the rod down the hole. I was too busy yacking   These will be guests for breakfast being gut hooked or damaged "
