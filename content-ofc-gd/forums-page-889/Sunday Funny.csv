312298,Mike the Pike,2009-03-01 17:34:00,3421,Told you you were becoming more canadian by the minute.  I would have to say the weatherman is preparing you for November Quinte G2G.  Don't let a little baby powder snowfall deter you get out there and show us what a redneck snowman looks like.  BTW do you actually own a snow shovel or you will have to make due with the garden Ho and the spade.  
312304,gotguns,2009-03-01 17:44:00,17,"I live up in Sudbury, trust me I would kill for that. We're burried deep and it is way too cold for the start of March."
