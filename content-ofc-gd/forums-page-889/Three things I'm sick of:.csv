312306,Mike the Pike,2009-03-01 17:48:00,3421,Come onnnnnnnnnn spriiiiiiiiinnnngggggg.
312331,Sinker,2009-03-01 18:54:00,8692,"One of my biggest pet peeves is whiners.  Next is people who complain about winter being so long.........gimme a break!! Its like 4 months of the year, get off your arse and make the best of it. Its always the people who sit inside all winter who complain.........get some gear and get out of the house.......its the best time of year!! If your out, and not dressed for cold........of course your going to get cold.......pretty simple fact!!  The leafs, no comment.  Curling.......people actually watch curling?? Like I said.......get off your arse and get outside!!  Sinker"
312388,Whitespinnerbait,2009-03-01 21:56:00,2038,"Just to change pace for a second here..............   Pull into the Gas station to get some Gas ,Fill up and Go inside to pay .......ya know what , I don't want to be asked if I want any lottery tickets today sir   :wallbash:   If I wanted some lottery tickets I would have asked for them on my own   As far as the snow and the cold ............happens every year   :canadian:"
312437,John Bacon,2009-03-01 23:11:00,3277," Yes, they have sucked for no reason in the other years.  It still remains to be seen whether this is a rebuilding year or a year that they suck for nothing.  With a new general manager, hopefully they can turn a poor year into an oportunity to someone that will help them in the future."
312459,Radnine,2009-03-01 23:55:00,1538, It's the best time of the year? Your brain must be frozen. I am not sure that anyone that thinks this way is fit for team 8. When it gets warmer I am going to talk to Bernie about trading you to another squad (perhaps for a set of proper winter clothes for me). Jim
312474,irishfield,2009-03-02 00:06:00,26272,Can't do that Jim... we're doomed without Shayne!
312477,Sinker,2009-03-02 00:09:00,8692," I've got a spare floater suit, 2 man portable, and lots of gear. If you ever wanted to go out icefishing, just let me know!!  If I leave team 8, my points come with me  S."
312509,Jigger,2009-03-02 00:43:00,1237,Spring is 3 paycheques away and ice out is only 7.
312517,Sinker,2009-03-02 00:51:00,8692, I'll be icefishing for at least 6 more weeks.   Spring ice fishing is killer  Sinker
312552,BassAsin,2009-03-02 01:48:00,806,i'll be ice fishing until i fall throught the ice in mid april then i take a break for a week then break out the canoe or rubber digny
312555,BassAsin,2009-03-02 01:49:00,806,"and just some advice radnine,  cut the cable, turn off the radio  and with the saved money buy some long johns, a sweater, a touque, hockey skates and a stick.   oh and a puck.  Matt!"
312574,Dozer,2009-03-02 02:17:00,896,"Quit complaining, you're 3/4 of the way through winter!  But yea for sure, bring on summer!"
312576,holdfast,2009-03-02 02:21:00,1813,Finally its light past 1830 hrs\ Gad I cant wait for March its still minus 30s
311978,Radnine,2009-02-28 22:15:00,1538,"#1 The yelling during a curling match. Man it is starting to annoy me. I've curled, I get that you have to communicate but it's getting stupid. Half the time you've got the shooter yelling ""hurry hard!!"" and the skip yelling No!! on the same rock. Shut up already (same goes for tennis with the grunting). #2 People (media types mostly) saying that it's OK for the Leafs to suck this year because it's a rebuilding year. I mean what have all of the other years been, years that they sucked for no reason whatsoever? Do you remember the year after the lock out, with the new rules and all the league was going to be better and faster etc.? The Leafs first signing in the new era, Ackie Burg and Wade Belak. I remember the announcement like it was yesterday. It is the moment I became a Habs fan (honestly, it's one of those where were you when moments). #3 Being cold. I stepped out the door this morning to drive my son to a buddy's house and was immediately cold through. Bless all of you that make a go of it in winter (fishing, sledding, etc.) But I'm bloody fed up with it. Thanks for listening. Jim"
311979,purekgw,2009-02-28 22:17:00,585,i agree with #3 i am SO tired of winter i want it gone RIGHT NOW!
311996,misfish,2009-02-28 22:44:00,29133,#3 YA GOT THAT RIGHT   ANYTIME
311998,JeffBornFishin,2009-02-28 22:53:00,260,#1 Yes.  If I hear haaaaaaaaaaaaaarrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrddddddddddd on one more tv commerical I am gonna snap   The way some of the women carry on during a tennis match I expect a baby to be born  #2 Not a huge hockey fan but everyone should face reality...how long since a cup was won in T.O.  #3 Yes I am looking forward to short sleeve weather.  Tomorrow would be just fine
312002,Burtess,2009-02-28 22:59:00,901,"#3...  Are you kidding me???  I wish winter would run 8 months of the year, with spring and autumn takeing the other 4...  Summer sucks...  Burt"
312006,MCTFisher9120,2009-02-28 23:13:00,3761,"It's winter get over it lol, who would think Canada would be soo cold"
312009,bigugli,2009-02-28 23:20:00,6138,"On #2. I'm also a realist. The Leafs are hopeless, and NHL hockey isn't much better. Watch the juniors instead.  #3  I love winters cold and snowy. Far better than the mushy an dull grey winters we have seen much of the past few years. There is something very wrong in being able to work my garden the first week of March"
312017,TJQ,2009-02-28 23:42:00,7806,LOL...  #1... I guess you wouldnt want to curl with me.. I yell at the other sheets....
312018,Radnine,2009-02-28 23:47:00,1538, Just long enough for Cactus Fest eh.
312064,brkygetr,2009-03-01 02:00:00,425,"#3..it's  -30:somethin' here right now...I could use a day on the ice with no gloves, coat, ect....way to friggin cold for late Feb!"
312066,Billy Bob,2009-03-01 02:07:00,5865,I could send you the Sabres
312073,crappieperchhunter,2009-03-01 02:12:00,2582,"#3 is a problem??? Is this CANADA or the beach at Club Med?  I'm with Burtess...summer is actually my least favourite 2-3 months of the year.  Spring, Fall, Winter.....yeah Baby.  Smelt fishing through the ice tomorrow. What could be better then sitting on a BIG HUNK of ice with a fishing rod in your hands????"
312082,Joey,2009-03-01 02:30:00,9122,"Okay, I wanna rant too  What bugs me is when you go and buy something with cash and then when they give you your change, they balance the silver on the paper currency.  Most times is falls all over or is just awkard to hold.  Remember when they used to hand you your silver change first and you put it in your change purse or pocket and then they handed you the paper currency?  Okay, rant over.  Joey"
312098,Burtess,2009-03-01 02:59:00,901, Cactus Fest rocks....
312116,theRJ,2009-03-01 03:57:00,55,Sorry to break it to ya but the grunting isn't going away. The grunt tenses the core muscles increasing power. LOL you can try that when your going for a long cast!  RJ
312123,HTHM,2009-03-01 04:15:00,4082,"Why do you all quit your belly achin' huh! ha! huuuuuuuunnnnnnnnnnnnnttttt!!!!!!!!!! And ya jokes over, this past week was great! Bring on spring!"

312144,Moosebunk,2009-03-01 04:57:00,3970,"Joey, that was good.  And so on point too. lol.  Pet peeve fer sure."
312159,danc,2009-03-01 05:38:00,4677, How about this one Moosebunk? A wind out of the north on Lake Nipigon?? One of my pet peeves for sure. You know why..
312160,Moosebunk,2009-03-01 05:41:00,3970,Ahhhhh for sure Dan.  But then again... is any day while on that lake really all that bad?
312164,OhioFisherman,2009-03-01 06:07:00,6623,"I know little or nothing about the first two, but worked on an unheated truck dock for 30+ years, no love for the cold. Drove an 18 wheeler around in traffic during the same time period, no love for the snow. LOL now I can`t handle heat."
312214,pikehunter,2009-03-01 13:59:00,1659,Gotta agree with ya Rad.  You too Joey  There is a good reason humans have little body hair or insulation such as a whale or walrus has...we were not meant to live in this climate!
312220,Fishnwire,2009-03-01 14:28:00,983,"My Mother-in-law was watching curling last weekend and I told her the same thing.  If I was playing I'd lose it, I'd snap and I'd tell the guy to settle down and stop yelling at me.  I'm busting my ass out there trying to sweep or whatever, and some guy is screaming at me that I'm not doing it hard enough?  No thanks.  I get plenty of that at work, I don't need it when I'm playing some game.  Sorry, but I don't care about the Leafs or any other team.  They don't care about me.  It is way too cold and has been that way for way too long.  The snow is going to take forever to melt at this rate.  I hate it.   You hit two out of three totally out of the park.  Nice job!"
312223,Billy Bob,2009-03-01 14:37:00,5865,"I think many will agree that fall and WINTER are nice until about March and then winter gets OLD on everyone. Winter is toooooooooooooo long and summer is toooooooo short. If we had spring by March 21st like most of the country (US) then winter would be more tolerable. But it seems to stretch sometime into mid May.  Got to go, the fire needs ANOTHER log on it.  Bob"
312227,lew,2009-03-01 14:56:00,12766,1. I think the curlers have to scream to keep the spectators from falling asleep   2. Maple Laffs........no comment   3. I think winter would be nice if it was only here for Christmas Eve then got nice again
