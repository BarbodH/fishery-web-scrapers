311991,lew,2009-02-28 22:37:00,12766,"Excellent video Pete & thanks to you and the rest of your guys who take the time to look after those of us who may get into trouble out there.  I hadn't worn a life jacket in probably 40 years, but last spring I was fishing alone on the West Bay of Nippissing on a very rough day when it suddently dawned on me how stupid I was being. There are very few cottages in that area and there wasn't another boat in sight.  I dug out a jacket and put it on and instantly felt safer and have worn it ever since when I'm alone in the boat.  Bad stuff happens way too quick."
312015,GBW,2009-02-28 23:40:00,8460,"Since my outing with 2 friends when the water was real bad I didn't wear a life jacket while fishing.  Since that day I have and I will when solo fishing no matter wwhat the weater is like.  I want to go home to my wife and kids.  I agree that this link to the video should be a stuck thread. Pete, I thank you from my family for this video and I hope many others pay attention to this too. Geoff"
312178,musky_man,2009-03-01 11:21:00,159,Two thumbs up -- well done!  
312179,jakey420,2009-03-01 11:38:00,4,"I wear mine always in a boat and mostly on land. It adds so much warmth on a cool summer night, fishing. I bought a fisherman jacket style pfd just for that reason. If you hit your head off a rock from the shore and your alone you better hope you wore a pfd of some type! Great job good post.  Cheers"
312809,BITEME,2009-03-02 16:16:00,1968, Just keep in mind a PFD is not a life jacket a life jacket in theory will bring you around mouth up in case you go black a PFD could but is not designed to do so
312817,brifishrgy,2009-03-02 16:36:00,559,I am going to have to show my son this video .. the next time he complains about wearing his jacket I can remind him of it .. great job
311424,BITEME,2009-02-27 13:58:00,1968,Good Morning there was a thread posted about Boats and your towing vehicle and i didnt want to hijack it .This is the second time I have had a vehicle used in a commercial. but by far most proud of this occurance . The video is for the CCGA this is our in house version but there is a general consumption video as well just not sure where the link is anyway here is my boat and ride http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=-3213663943097023108  Cheers Peter
311431,Roy,2009-02-27 14:21:00,13728,WOW!  That really deserves its own thread Peter. Thanks for posting  this and thank you so much for being a part of those people who are part of the solution. A very touching video as well.
311436,BITEME,2009-02-27 14:40:00,1968,THANKS ROY!!!!!!!!!!!!!
311439,irishfield,2009-02-27 14:50:00,26272,Very well put together Peter... from the Rabbit.. to the tear... oh that was me! lol  So easy to do when you get careless and even worse when you have hydraulic steering... the boat ain't comin back.
311443,John,2009-02-27 15:00:00,2956,Thank you so much for posting that Peter. Thank you to all of the volunteers and the Town of Oakville.
311447,brkygetr,2009-02-27 15:10:00,425,"That goes to show you how easy it would be to end in the drink for an extended period of time. I can honestly say I do not wear my jacket that often, mind you I am always within 2-300 yds of some sort of land mass (lots of islands, bays, and points on the lakes I fish), though it is vislible in the boat. Now I am not so sure that cuts it.  Many times with the vastness of lakes and bays out here I will take off and tell my GF where I am planning on going and an expected return time. I feel this is a necessary action for the exact reasoning of this video.  I know at some point, even with all precautions and unintentional errors I WILL get stuck out there for a night or 2, hopefully on land, but possibly in the drink. If that happens it makes me feel releived that there are people out there that are good at their job and will but forth the effort to get me back to my home and friends.  6000 lives over 30 years, is a lot of souls that got their feet back on dry land...hands down to you all that keep us safe out there. An exceptional job and keep it up, you have my support."
311451,BITEME,2009-02-27 15:22:00,1968,Thanks
311457,b2kptbo,2009-02-27 15:26:00,1505,"Very well done, thanks Peter..."
311459,BITEME,2009-02-27 15:32:00,1968,  HEY  hows the retired life buddy!!!! Eddie retired the other day they hung his jacket(49ers over the catwalk in RFS
311465,GeorgeJ,2009-02-27 15:53:00,207,"EXCELLENT I hope ever boater and fisherman take the time to watch it. I had a very close call last summer 200 ft from shore fishing out of a canoe, no life jacket on one in the canoe, flip over no sign of life jack, my golden Lab sees me in the water he swims out and almost takes me under, he thinks its play time, my future son in law hears us, swims out and saves the day. Now for me and anyone in my boat= LIFE JACKET ON!"
311467,Marty,2009-02-27 15:56:00,873,Thanks.   Boy does that really make me rethink my confidence level while fishing.   I usually only wear the life jacket when moving.
311471,TroutnMuskieHunter,2009-02-27 16:00:00,1362,What a great video   ....kudos to you and the auxillary members that risk their lives for others!....very impressive
311758,theRJ,2009-02-28 02:05:00,55,Great Video. Should make everyone who fishes without a jacket think about how quick the ish can hit the fan. I hate wearing a life jacket while fishing so my first purchase after getting a boat will be a CO2 inflatable jacket. I won't wear a normal jacket otherwise and IMHO my life is worth the extra dough to make sure I'm safe.  RJ
311769,Cudz,2009-02-28 02:27:00,2652,Good vid.  I need to wear my pfd more often as well.
311782,SlowPoke,2009-02-28 02:59:00,2984,I didn't know what to expect when I clicked on the link! The message is clear; DON NOT LEND YOUR BOAT AND TRUCK TO FRIENDS! Great video Peter. I bought an inflatable PFD just for those occasions... I just have to start wearing it all the time.
311785,Fisherman,2009-02-28 03:06:00,7201,"And hook up the kill switch, that's what it's there for."
311788,Joey,2009-02-28 03:10:00,9122,"Very well done Peter.  You guys are worth your weight in gold     A great service you do for society.  So I almost had to laugh when the wife says her husband was supposed to be back 3 hours ago tho.  When have you ever known a fisherman to come home on time  All kidding aside, great video.  Joey"
311807,aniceguy,2009-02-28 03:58:00,1094,Peter that is a great video explaining exactly what canhappen....ohhhh you have one slick boat there too   thanks for the video its in the favorites now
311808,Leecher,2009-02-28 04:09:00,7832,Thanks for sharing that video Peter Luckily the guy had a PFD on.... but just imagine the same scenario without one.... dont think he could of survive that long.  Leechman
311816,PERCHER,2009-02-28 04:34:00,787,Great vid Pete.I remember you telling about it.I Seen you guys in action a couple times out there.We both Know how bad that lake can get.And the part of the boat just driving away is now a huge reminder to use my bail out cord.Again great vid and way to go lending your boat to make a fantastic saftey video.By the way nice roof rack on the truck .  . Dan
311818,Sinker,2009-02-28 04:39:00,8692,Great video!  A real eye opener....  Sinker
311891,sonny,2009-02-28 15:46:00,511,"As fishermen and boaters we don't think of this kind of thing happening enough,,as the soft water season draws closer will you promise your loved ones to  be safer this year?"
311906,DT10Sam,2009-02-28 16:34:00,480,"Great video self explanatory.....the mods should maybe make this a sticky on the site somewhere (just me thoughts)  Regards, Sam"
311950,lunkerbasshunter,2009-02-28 19:20:00,2585,"that is a great video.  i wear my life jacket almost all the time.  the only time i really dont if i am catching a nap, anhored in some back bay  cheers!"
