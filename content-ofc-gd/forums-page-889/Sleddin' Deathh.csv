This is the second serious injury my son has witnessed this season- one on Simcoe- the Cook bay racetrack, where a fellow lost it on a Yamaha RX 1, and now this- Pretty sure it keeps him a better rider knowing how quickly a wonderful sport can turn deadly. My condolences to the family of the poor lad in Haliburton. Too many things to end sweet life out there."

312247,darsky,2009-03-01 15:35:00,586,who says recklessness and carelessness were factors? Why comment like that?
312248,BillM,2009-03-01 15:37:00,17367, I wouldn't say that...  A moment of not paying attention can have very bad effects.
312262,Greencoachdog,2009-03-01 16:02:00,8163, This is the portin of the main post I was replying to!

Three years ago my friend was riding (not fast and not carelessly) and due to flat light accidentally drove his sled off a 30 foot cliff!!! He ended up with a broken hip and ribs as well as other injuries, but could have just as easily died in the accident. Even riding 20 mph I have had issues with flat light and not being able to see dip and bumps that could easily cause a person to get kicked off the trail."
