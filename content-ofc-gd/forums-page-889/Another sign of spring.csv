312453,HTHM,2009-03-01 23:42:00,4082,How are you guys doing with roll up the rim so far? I am 3 wins (coffees) for 6
312456,irishfield,2009-03-01 23:48:00,26272,Guess I'll have to buy my prize... don't patronize the place.
312458,Leecher,2009-03-01 23:53:00,7832,"I don't buy coffee there that often, but from the ones I bought recently,  It's a big zero for me"
312462,Whitespinnerbait,2009-03-01 23:59:00,2038,I'm zero for twelve...............
312464,MCTFisher9120,2009-03-02 00:01:00,3761,I'm 1 for 5...i won a donut this morning.
312468,Radnine,2009-03-02 00:02:00,1538,"If you've won three times already you are spending too much on coffee. An extra large a day will cost about $45.00/month, put that money in an index fund (low MER, safe) and when the TSX is back up around 14000 points you will have almost doubled your money. Buy a dividend fund that holds lots of bank stocks and you might do even better. Jim"
312473,EC1,2009-03-02 00:06:00,930,0 for 2 here. I gave up on this already. Might as well save the money and buy myself a few more crankbaits this coming season
312493,BillM,2009-03-02 00:25:00,17367,"I've had 4-5 cups since it started, haven't won a thing."
312499,tdotfisherman,2009-03-02 00:33:00,317,"I'm 1 for 2 (free coffee). I'm hoping to win one of those $10,000 prizes.. that would buy a hell of a lot of fishing tackle.."
312504,love2fishhave2work,2009-03-02 00:37:00,212,I am a 2 cups a day guy.  12-14/week - 52 weeks a year - every year.  Don't care to do the math but I  have never won even a dang muffin at that contest.  I think I am due.
312566,steelhead hunter,2009-03-02 02:07:00,152,2 for 12 both donuts but 10g's would be nice
312601,Mattones,2009-03-02 02:53:00,587,1 out of maybe 3 or 4?
312622,nautifish,2009-03-02 03:18:00,1416,2 out of 3 so far....Its the only time i order an XL....LOL...When i win a freebie...My son bought my 1st one when it started which was a winner then i got another three days later and another winner......Used that today and won...Please play again....
312628,danc,2009-03-02 03:27:00,4677,I haven't bought a coffee there ever. My $4.99 tub of Folgers from Walmart nets me about 300 cups or so. 300 cups from Timmies = $500.00??? Just doesn't make sense to me.
312636,xeon,2009-03-02 03:53:00,350, $625-725 a year in coffee.   I like the Folgers idea. Hell they even sell the coffee cans at tim hortons too. You can play online now aswell.
312655,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2009-03-02 05:33:00,0,1 for 5.
312690,Spiel,2009-03-02 11:53:00,9065," Ditto, though I don't shop Walmart.  I actually have a $25 Timmies gift card in my wallet (Christmas gift) that I haven't used and Lord knows if I ever will? Praps on some wayward trip to Nipigon or something."
312714,corvette1,2009-03-02 13:28:00,1765,now 1 for 6 and i don't even drink coffee
312716,Governator,2009-03-02 13:33:00,879," lol... I agree, huge waste of money (I use to do it everyday).  Since I work from home, I started drinking maxwell to save money but I actually now buy the tins of Tim Hortons coffee, I just like the taste better but I'm still saving a ton of money."
312718,ChrisK,2009-03-02 13:37:00,2772,"1 free coffee so far..That makes it 1 fer 2...My wife won the ""Coleman Camper"" prize couple years back...."
