311853,Big Cliff,2009-02-28 13:13:00,6899,"We are having a bit of a party tonight and the theam is Mexican, I would like to down load some Mexican music. I looked at Lime Wire but they want you to pay for a membership, heck, I only want a few songs. Can anyone point me in the right direction?"
311855,Roy,2009-02-28 13:28:00,13728,"Yeah, I could use that info too please. I need to pick up an MP3 player today. J will be in the hospital soon getting knee replacement and they suggested that she use an MP3 player to listen to tunes so as not to hear the sound of saws and such going through her bones.  Cliff, you and Sue go easy on the fajitas and have a great time!"
311856,lunkerbasshunter,2009-02-28 13:31:00,2585,there is a free version of limewire i use.  cheers!

311866,Big Cliff,2009-02-28 14:00:00,6899,"Me too, I really appreciate it!"
311869,crappieperchhunter,2009-02-28 14:22:00,2582, Get some tequila into everybody and they will be doing the chicken dance to whatever you play  I have been using Limewire for years Cliff....no problems so far.
311871,packrat,2009-02-28 14:24:00,93,winmx is still around----some files wont play for some reason but there are usually enough other files of the same tune that you'll get one to play on the puter.  they check the download for content but wouldnt hurt to scan with an antivirus just in case.
311872,ccmtcanada,2009-02-28 14:26:00,7971,"Make sure when using Limewire to look to the right side...make sure there is a number under ""bitrate"".  (Don't download anything under 128kb/s).  The files can be called songname.mp3, but can actually be malicious files.  The bitrate tells you they are actual music files."
311878,ccmtcanada,2009-02-28 14:55:00,7971,"Standard bit rates for MP3s are 128, 160, 192, 256 and 360.  Avoid downloading ones with other bitrates."
311916,Big Cliff,2009-02-28 17:22:00,6899,"Thank you so much for all the help! ccmt, thank you so much for the PMs and the phone call, that really helped. I now have what I need, the decorations are in place, the food is cooking, the music is playing..... Feels, looks, and smells just like I'm in Tijuana. Now if I could only find my speedo  Thanks again everyone."
311941,douG,2009-02-28 18:42:00,2693,"Now  there's a happy thought, Big Cliff in a speedo and a sombrero.  Just to put you in the mood...  http://www.abeautifulviolin.com/funnystuff...ielitoLindo.wmv  Good info from Cliff ccmt on the bitrate thingy, pay attention - he knows whereof he speakth."
311955,Burtess,2009-02-28 20:47:00,901, This is good info... stay away from others and you should aviod most virus etc...  Burt
311958,motv8tr,2009-02-28 21:09:00,2587,"I know nothing of the music but if there's tequila, I wanna go to the party  Maureen"
311959,tizfun,2009-02-28 21:19:00,292,Ares.. I use it all the time... Great and easy to work with...  Tiz
311976,Governator,2009-02-28 22:12:00,879,"whatever u use, I highly suggest you have some antivirus installed prior to downloading anything from peer 2 peer networks (remember you are downloading from other people's computers here).  Be very careful of what you download as well, if you're new to using P2P networks like limewire, than definitely stay within your limits of knowledge, stick with mp3s and don't download any suspicious files."
312037,soggey,2009-03-01 00:50:00,20,"I also use limewire, great program. Like everyone else said watch the bitrate, there is some junk on there. Another one is Bearshare, but I am not even sure if it is still around."
312145,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2009-03-01 04:58:00,0,"i download torrent downloading.  once you start using it, you'll never use limewire again. download a simple torrent program like  utorrent, visit a site like mininova.org to find what you want, and download. as the guys suggested earlier, pay attention to what you're downloading."
312150,Guest skeeter99,2009-03-01 05:04:00,0,"please do yourself a favour and stay away from limewire, too many viruses   but a good one is the blubster free, practically virus free!!   anyhow  this thread make me laugh cause I posted maps and got in trouble for copyrighted material?  and here mods etc. are looking for sites to download copyrighted material  so it's not okay to share copyrighted maps but not music?  just a observation"
312154,danc,2009-03-01 05:23:00,4677," Like everyone else on the planet, mods like free music too."
312169,buckster,2009-03-01 06:52:00,530,  I dunno i kinda like free maps too!
312174,Roy,2009-03-01 10:46:00,13728," You're right 99, that was clumsily worded. Yesterday morning I got out and got her an IPOD and was able to figure out how to put her favourite CDs on there. Anyhow, you have a great day Bubba."
