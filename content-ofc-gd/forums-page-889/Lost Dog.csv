312626,mbac31,2009-03-02 03:25:00,904,Just came back. Guess he decided he wanted to go for a solo walk. Thanks
312635,ohhenrygsr,2009-03-02 03:48:00,947,haha i goo stuff dont you ever want to put a cam on them and just see where they go
312641,cram,2009-03-02 04:11:00,1733,"Beagles love to go for their own personal tours :-).  Glad he came back.  I was worried he turned into coyote chow.  Great looking dog, btw.   Its not pure beagle, is it?"
312652,hammercarp,2009-03-02 05:10:00,964,Glad you got him back. Beagles are the best escape artists going.
312653,Maverick,2009-03-02 05:12:00,371,"Nice lookin' hound. Great to hear he came back. I have a Beagle/Collie myself, I think my gf would kill me if he ever took off haha."
312657,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2009-03-02 05:39:00,0,"great to hear the puppers came back. my dog is my best bud, especially in the bush!"
312672,Big Cliff,2009-03-02 10:29:00,6899,"I have had to do a few ""search and find"" missions for my guy, he loves to take off and visit every chance he gets. We have the invisable fence but if you forget to put his collar on him he seems to know and the second you get distracted he is gone. Fortunatly we have always been able to find him and bring him home. Glad things worked out for you and your guy came home safe and sound!"
312687,mbac31,2009-03-02 11:49:00,904,"Weirdly enough he is a pure bread. I have 2 friends that breed them/ He has just turned out looking weird. He is Tattooed and registered as well. He was also suposed to be larger, that did not work out either. Third whammy is that he is one of my best trained dogs for Rabbits but turned out to be gunshy, go figure. The other one that I have is a Mix beagle. A little kid let him out yesterday, thats how he got out. They know when they are free to roam boy. They sure take advantage of it as well."
312727,corvette1,2009-03-02 13:43:00,1765,i know how you must have felt i have 16 buds
312737,JohnF,2009-03-02 14:07:00,3494,"Friend of mine used to have a beagle. He just assumed that whenever he took the beasty into the bush on a bird hunt he wasn't gonna see him for a few days. They hunted a lot at the back of our farm and the little guy would just show up at my door one morning, looking pretty exhausted, ready to go home. We could actually hear him sometimes, chasing rabbits or whatever he was doing, making a helluva racket back there. His name was Rammy. Great name for his personality.  JF"
