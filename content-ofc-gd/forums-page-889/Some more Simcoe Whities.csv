312485,Joey,2009-03-02 00:16:00,9122,"After our great day on Friday you couldn't keep us away from our ""spot"" again today.  It was productive once again.  We weren't there 10 minutes and Paul had the first fish on.    He outfished me once again             Our anniversary was last weekend so Paul got me this nice new fishfinder.  I had never used one for icefishing before and found it was pretty handy to figure out what depth to fish.    At times, the fish were in THICK!!  No time to have a smoke when the fishfinder looks like this    I also found out why the whities were keen to hang out here  These schools went by about every hour.    It got a bit cold outside for Paul so I let him join me in the hut.  Even gave him the hole I was using      I did manager a few, only took a pic of this one tho.    So it was another great day.  Paul went 8 for 15 and I went 2 for 6.  They really do smell like cucumber eh!!  Cheers,  Joey"
