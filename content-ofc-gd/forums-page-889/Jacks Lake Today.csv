Stopped into Stone's Live Bait on 28 and picked up some minnows...all the pinheads are gone so I took what they had.  A little big for the job but they will work.  I want to send a big thank you to Big Cliff who kindly let me borrow his Vexilar!    Wow what a difference a unit like that makes  The walk out was tricky as there is no snow cover and with friday's rain and the overnight deep freeze it was slick.  Walked out onto the ice and drilled my first hole at 7am.  Was a beautiful morning even with the -20c temp.  Holes keep freezing up fast and it was a battle with the guides and line until the sun started beating down.   Looking around I could see tons of holes had been recently drilled.  Plenty of people out today in trucks, atv's & snowmobiles.      Not long after starting on my first hole I was rewarded to ice a nice 11 inch Crappie  Finally a respectable fish for Team 2  Was marking more fish but the bite was lite and the fish were quick at stealing minnows.      Moved around and drilled a bunch of holes.  Took some time but I iced another nice but smaller Crappie.    Around lunchtime people starting showing up to remove ice huts.  This part of the lake closes today.  A few more minnows lost and I called it a day.  A beautiful day to be out and enjoy some ice time even if the fishing was slow  Now for the money shots      I think it will be a nice tasty brunch for Sunday am  Thanks again Big Cliff for letting me borrow the Vexilar"
311999,Greencoachdog,2009-02-28 22:55:00,8163,Congrats on the fish and entry Jeff!  I think you really need the Ad. woman out there to show you how it's done though!
312001,JeffBornFishin,2009-02-28 22:59:00,260," Thanks Glen  Fat chance...She hates winter, especially ice!  Bring on the softwater season"
312003,Greencoachdog,2009-02-28 23:05:00,8163, Buy her some warm clothes Jeff!  ... she should know better than to try and run around in the hot pants and tube top in the winter  !!!
312012,Beans,2009-02-28 23:32:00,3339,Way to go Jeff...I was thinking of you while I was outside this morning bringing in some wood for the fire...Brrrrrrr  Sure was some kind of chilly day...  Glad you managed to ice a few without my help...
312025,JeffBornFishin,2009-02-28 23:58:00,260," Thanks for the kind words Beans  When I started walking out there this am I thought of you and wondered if your back could handle it. I managed to fall down once, and it was a good one! Wham  feeling it now.  A set of cleats is on my wish list for the next ice season  We will get together another time for sure...I like to take a run up to north pigeon in the boat once in a while"
