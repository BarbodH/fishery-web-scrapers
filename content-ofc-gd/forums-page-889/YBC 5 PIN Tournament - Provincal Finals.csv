She played 5 games and had a 190 average.  Not bad for a 13 year old   She was able to finish 3rd and got a bronze medal.   I'm real proud of her accomplishment  and could not ask for anything better.   She had a good time and that's what counts.  Here's a pic of my champion    Thought I'd share this moment with you Leechman"
