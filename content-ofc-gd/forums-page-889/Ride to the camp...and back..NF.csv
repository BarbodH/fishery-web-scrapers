Seen probably a dozen deer on the way out and a bald eagle. Here's a couple of pictures along the way out.    This guy was hanging out at the Restoule landfill site.    Good friend Al unloading his sled.    Here's me driving without a mitt freezing my hand. Wasn't sure whether this would turn out or not. Click on it to play the video.    This is the sled I used on the weekend on the right.    On the way home today the weather was the same. It was a little chilly this morning -26c. This guy wasn't afraid at all, just watched me as I took the shot.    This is the river between Commanda and Restoule Lakes    And that was the journey of the weekend."
312419,Leecher,2009-03-01 22:50:00,7832,Right on Bernie Beautiful scenery and perfect weather condition.... can't ask for more  Thanks for sharing your journey Jacques
312422,Bernie,2009-03-01 22:57:00,3190,Thanks Jacques. It was my first ride of the year and was fun to get out there. Was good to spend the weekend with my dad and a couple of good friends. We took out a refrigerator and I brought out an old generator to overhaul and install at the cottage. Watched the hockey game for a while but the bunk was calling early after the fresh air day and a little CC    .

312439,Bernie,2009-03-01 23:15:00,3190,Right on Wayne. Keep busy and winter will pass faster. This was the first winter in a few years I didn't have a winter project at the cottage. It sure has made the winter drag. But getting out does revitalize you. I do feel great today.
312466,Sinker,2009-03-02 00:01:00,8692,"Ahhh.......this is a refreshing post!  Gotta love outside activities in the winter!!  Your right, sitting inside whining about it just makes it worse, and you feel much better after a good day out in the fresh air!!  Thanks for posting Bernie! Any pics of the camp?? I'd bet its a nice place you guys have set up! Good area, that's for sure!!  Sinker"
312469,Joey,2009-03-02 00:03:00,9122,Great pics Bernie.  Looks like it was a great ride  Joey
312487,Bernie,2009-03-02 00:20:00,3190,"It's a pretty good camp Sinker. This is the third one of a long line of tradition built in 1960. Bunks 16 and lots of room. Hot and cold running water, shower, generator, propane grill, 6 burner propane stove, satellite TV, solar panel to run 12vdc lights in the morning and many other innovative ideas. But the best part is all the guys get along and contribute their skills to make it all work.  Here is unpacking the groceries for the 2 week hunt.    My dad in the foreground and my son on the right. Friends and relatives on the left.    Shooting the breeze. You can see the bunkhouse through the doorway.  "
312488,Bernie,2009-03-02 00:22:00,3190,Thanks Joey. The ride was fun. Getting out with dad and the guys was the best part though.
312736,Gerritt,2009-03-02 14:07:00,6129,Awesome report Bernie!! damn I am envious of that hunt camp! Looks like a TON of stories have been shared there.... man if those walls could talk!!  Thanks for sharing  G
