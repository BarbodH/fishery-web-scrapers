312425,glen,2009-03-01 22:57:00,2641,I am thinking about trying Waubaushene for pickerel pike crappie or whatever will bite.  I will go to one of the groups of huts that are in the channel close to the highway.  Has anyone been out there?  How is the fishing? Thankyou for any replies.
312428,irishfield,2009-03-01 23:00:00,26272,Don't know Glen... but by quick count there is about 150 huts out there... someone's gotta be catchin something.
312433,glen,2009-03-01 23:08:00,2641,Either that or they dont like it at home.  Hi Wayne.
312435,irishfield,2009-03-01 23:09:00,26272,LOL Glen. Ice looks real good out there... traffic on it almost up to the open area on the Port Severn outflow. NO snow !
