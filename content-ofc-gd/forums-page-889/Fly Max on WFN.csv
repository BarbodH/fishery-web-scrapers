312441,OntarioFlyFisher,2009-03-01 23:19:00,1,"Hi KelfuN, Paul,  Thanks very much for the positive feedback!  We are very excited to finally be airing on WFN in Canada.  Now that the series has begun, you can expect to catch new episodes every week on Thursdays at 9pm EST, then again on Fridays at 9am and 3pm and on Sunday at 6pm.  All times are EST.  There are 13 episodes in total, with 5 shot in 2007 and 7 shot in 2008.  Personally, I hope the difference in production quality from 2007 stuff to 2008 stuff is clear.  We knew very little about what we were doing when we first started, but we eventually got better and better.  I hope the viewers agree.  I would urge any anglers who have not yet fly fished to watch the show. Thanks again and keep the feedback coming.  Truly,  Nick Pujic"
