312631,holdfast,2009-03-02 03:35:00,1813,"     At the start of the year 1812, the regular army had a few less than 7,000 enlisted men in it It’, as Peter Bud Porter had said, the standing army was the sword of the Republic and the militia its shield, the sword was little more than a dagger, totally inadequate to invade Canada. For this reason, the Madison administration made the mistake of trying to use the shield for cutting and thrusting, a function it could not perform, since it was a defense mechanism only. For its first thrust, the strategy makers sent Brigadier General William Hull to invade Canada from Detroit with a small army of mixed components. The Ohio militia with Hull refused, on statutory grounds, to cross into Canada Hull had developed a deep distrust of militia during his service as an officer in the American Revolution, and militia action once again shook his confidence. For this and other reasons he surrendered his force to an inferior one on August 17, 1812. When tried many months later for cowardice and other military crimes, he testified that his failure had been due in large part to the rawness, lack of discipline, and insubordination of the militia. 25   Quote from the History of the Militia   Truth be told they were afraid of the Indians  That militia was completely unsuitable for invasion was illustrated also at the other (eastern) end of the Ontario Peninsula. There, Major General Stephen Van Rensselaer, New York militia, led 350 regulars and 250 volunteers across the Niagara River on October 12, 1812, making a defendable lodgment on high ground at Queenstown, Canada. He had three men to the British one, but most of his force was still on the United States side of the river. It only remained to bring them into the fight to win the action, but the militia refused to cross into foreign territory. No more regulars were available to cross because their commander was unwilling to be subordinate to a militia officer. The senior militia officer over the men who had crossed, General Wadsworth, turned the command over to Colonel Winfield Scott, U. S. Army, but nothing could rescue that detachment from surrender save reinforcements, which did not come. 26"

After two years of warfare, the major causes of the war had disappeared. Neither side had any reason to continue or any chance of gaining a decisive success which would compel their opponents to cede territory or advantageous peace terms. As a result of this stalemate, the two nations(Briton and US) signed the Treaty of Ghent on 24 December 1814. I think becase of no cell phones or internet back than it took a few months for the americans to get the news of the treaty signing , so the fighting continued and the americans won a major victory at the battle of New Orleans but that occured after the treaty was signed so it dont count , NO ONE REALLY WON  no reason to continue"

The United States failed in its objective of invading and conquering Canada.  The British failed in its efforts to impose its mastery of the seas, and its rules, on American seafaring and commerce.  The Battle of New Orleans was an accident that occurred after the war was over."
311517,capt bruce,2009-02-27 17:54:00,820,"Thank you Big , A guy with the name BRUCE must know his history lol  The war was ended by the Treaty of Ghent, signed on December 24, 1814 and taking effect February 18, 1815. The terms stated that fighting between the United States and Britain would cease, all conquered territory was to be returned to the prewar claimant, the Americans were to gain fishing rights in the Gulf of Saint Lawrence, and that both the United States and Britain agreed to recognize the prewar boundary between Canada and the United States.  The Treaty of Ghent, which was promptly ratified by the Senate in 1815, ignored the grievances that led to war. Britain made no concessions concerning impressment, blockades, or other maritime differences; the treaty proved to be merely an expedient to end the fighting. Mobile and parts of western Florida remained permanently in American possession, despite objections by Spain, and Britain was unwilling to enforce treaty provisions regarding their claim to the territories.Thus, the war ended in a stalemate with no gain for either side.So the only loser, if ya want to call it that  was Spain , because the US didnt return their territory as promised (guess the had their fingers crossed or some such thing)and Brition didnt care enough to make them live up to the treaty provisions ."

Here is the Wikipedia opinion, disputed for neutrality for some reason:  The majority of the inhabitants of Upper Canada (Ontario) were either exiles from the United States (United Empire Loyalists) or postwar immigrants. The Loyalists were hostile to union with the U.S., while the other settlers seem to have been uninterested. The Canadian colonies were thinly populated and only lightly defended by the British Army. Americans then believed that many in Upper Canada would rise up and greet a United States invading army as liberators, a now-discredited belief. The combination suggested an easy conquest, as former President Thomas Jefferson seemed to believe in 1812: ""The acquisition of Canada this year, as far as the neighbourhood of Quebec, will be a mere matter of marching, and will give us the experience for the attack on Halifax, the next and final expulsion of England from the American continent."""

311409,holdfast,2009-02-27 13:17:00,1813,"Dawg, what a great Question.  Thankyou for giving me a platform to enlighten some Canadian History.  I know not your intention but here it goes.  http://www.battleoflundyslane.com/ This Battle is a controversy.  The Americans seized the British/Canadian Cannon ( so they won the Battle) But the Americans had to go back to the States as they had no supplies.  The British/Canadians recaptured their cannon.  We figure we won.  Tidbit.... The French settlers were considered Canadians back then  Sadly the grave yard is a little fenced in area surrounded by infrastructure.  A neat place to visit.  I know one thing, the Yanks lost at Queensto Heights because the American Militia found something in their clause that stated they couldn't fight off American Territory when ordered by the Regulars across the river..  That was when The Americans invaded crossing the Niagara River fighting Brock.  Thing was they were afraid of the Indians (Tecumseh) that were screaming across the River.  True story.  We done the war following the Battlefields as our Military Professional Development.  Of note, there is a huge statue of General Brock looking across the River to the States and depending what angle your looking at it from.  Hes giving you guys the Finger. (Actually I think hes pointing) Somewhere around Queenston heights.  No slag there, but it was the tour Guide ( Historian that brought it to our attention).  Unless its changed.  Tecumsehs memorial is a little ole rock, but without him we'd be American."
311417,johnnyb,2009-02-27 13:43:00,3413,Yep..the statue was still there the last time I was in Queenston...looks pretty cool.  Tecumseh could sure use a little more recognition though.

Brock’s monument is still there and yes it appears he is giving the finger to our neighbours to the south. Actually, it is a sword he is holding. There is a winding cement staircase inside the monument you can climb that is extremely narrow and steep. When passing someone on the way down or up, you have to stop and hug the wall to make room. The 360 degree view from the top is incredible, miles of vineyards, the Lower Niagara where many OFC members fish… etc. It’s a stones throw from the Queenston launch.  Laura Secord a local farmer’s wife played an important role in winning this battle. When the Americans were spotted crossing the river, she hiked several miles through forested areas to warn Brock. The Laura Secord House is also a stone’s throw from the Queenston boat launch."

311461,Ramble,2009-02-27 15:45:00,713,"So much history about the war. My grade 8 teacher's great great grand mother (i think thats the right number of greats) was the Lundy's lane land owner. Brock was distant cousin to my ancestors. My own ancestors were in the milita and loyalists. 3 or 4 of them got sizable land grants from the government for their service. 2 brothers....one of my direct descendants ran raids over the boarder with the natives around the St. Lawrance area.  The history of the native involvements is amazing. They are  the most interesting sidesof the war of 1812 history i think.  One of my favourite sotries...  I believe it was the Battle of Detroit...and I think, in total, there were only maybe between 500 and 800 dudes under Brock and Tecumseh. The were up against an american force with superior numbers. So they marched the natives around a patch of trees a bunch of times to make their numbers look like 5000. The Americans surrendered or retreated...i dont remember which. But it is one of my favourite stories....one of the best bluff's i've ever heard off lol.

A colonel's regimentals shine, and women call them fair. I am Alexander MacIntosh, a nephew to the Laird And I do distain men who are vain, the men with powdered hair.  I command the Nancy Schooner from the Moy on Lake St. Claire. On the third day of October, boys, I did set sail from there. To the garrison at Amherstburg I quickly would repair With Captain Maxwell and his wife and kids and powdered hair.  Aboard the Nancy In regimentals bright. Aboard the Nancy With all his pomp and bluster there, aboard the Nancy-o.  Below the St. Clair rapids I sent scouts unto the shore To ask a friendly Whyandot to say what lay before. ""Amherstburg has fallen, with the same for you in store! And militia sent to take you there, fifty horse or more.""  Up spoke Captain Maxwell then, ""Surrender, now, I say! Give them your Nancy schooner and make off without delay! Set me ashore, I do implore. I will not die this way!"" Says I, ""You go, or get below, for I'll be on my way!""  Aboard the Nancy! ""Surrender, Hell!"" I say. Aboard the Nancy ""It's back to Mackinac I'll fight, aboard the Nancy-o.""  Well up comes Colonel Beaubien, then, who shouts as he comes near. ""Surrender up your schooner and I swear you've naught to fear. We've got your Captain Maxwell, sir, so spare yourself his tears."" Says I, ""I'll not but send you shot to buzz about your ears.""  Well, they fired as we hove anchor, boys, and we got under way, But scarce a dozen broadsides, boys, the Nancy they did pay Before the business sickened them. They bravely ran away. All sail we made, and reached the Lake before the close of day.  Aboard the Nancy! We sent them shot and cheers. Aboard the Nancy! We watched them running through the trees, aboard the Nancy-o.  Oh, military gentlemen, they bluster, roar and pray. Nine sailors and the Nancy, boys, made fifty run away. The powder in their hair that day was powder sent their way By poor and ragged sailor men, who swore that they would stay.  Aboard the Nancy! Six pence and pound a day Aboard the Nancy!
