The last place I look was tackle shop in Guelph but they no longer carry them as most of loomis rod factory moved to China.  I am looking for one that is made in USA not from China.  Help would be much appreciated."

312168,ADB,2009-03-01 06:45:00,444,"Ace -  As Silvio said, Loomis does not make a 17' rod.  The longest trout-specific spinning rod Loomis makes would be 7'2"" - part of their new trout-spinning series.  The longest overall would be 15', however, those rods are center pins and fly-rods.  Le Baron - in Markham and Mississauga - carries the trout-specific rods, as well as the 15' center pin rod. http://lebaron.ca/pdf_files_sp09/fishing/gloomis_species.pdf http://lebaron.ca/pdf_files_sp09/fishing/gloomis_gl2.pdf  You can browse Loomis' whole line at: http://www.gloomis.com/publish/content/glo...e/products.html  Also, as far I know, Loomis does still make all of their rods in the States.  Hope this helps."
