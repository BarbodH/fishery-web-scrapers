56702,OhioFisherman,2007-04-08 00:50:00,6623,I didn`t get one!
56703,taper,2007-04-08 00:50:00,611,Johnny I'm not sure but I think they said you have to save the sent message or you wont see it.
56704,Guest Johnny Bass,2007-04-08 00:51:00,0,Oh I see... I had to check the box to show I sent them. Thanks. I guess we can delete this thread.
