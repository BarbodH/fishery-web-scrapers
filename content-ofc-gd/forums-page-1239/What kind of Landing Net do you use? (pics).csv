56476,muskymatt,2007-04-07 13:39:00,2608,"Beckman, as a pen , works great    Matt"
55880,98Fahrenheit,2007-04-06 00:47:00,108,Just curious as to what landing nets do you guys use?  I have a collapsable net (2 Sections)  Material:  Green Ethene Mesh* Length in cm (full extended):  180 Dimensions in cm (LxWxH):  60x60x60  *ETHENE used is for DEEP SEA FISHING. WILL NEVER BREAK. EXTREMELY DURABLE. Way STRONGER than RUBBER!  Folded:  Fully Extended:  Deep Pocket: 
56114,PatrickGG,2007-04-06 16:15:00,562,I fish from the shore so my hands make all the landings when bringing fish in.
56125,Heybud_e,2007-04-06 16:39:00,208,"yep, my hands work just fine as well, but iff`n i do need a net, i use a cradle.."
56134,Whopper,2007-04-06 17:00:00,2174,Thumb and forefinger or I swing em to the boat   just ask Wayne!  I did catch a couple fish last year that made thier way into other peoples nets  Whopper
56135,Roy,2007-04-06 17:01:00,13728,Under which circumstances would you use a cradle?
56141,Whopper,2007-04-06 17:08:00,2174, Only reason I can think of is if the Mrs and I had a little accident  Whopper
56145,misfish,2007-04-06 17:15:00,29133,Ya topped Roy on that one Whopper.LOL   I like the crane style.LOL
56151,Rich Clemens,2007-04-06 17:28:00,3131,"I don't have a pic, but I use the Frabill Big Game Net.   Should seen the look on the wife's face when it arrived and pulled it from the box.   After using it on my first ski ... she understood it's value."
56154,Dano,2007-04-06 17:34:00,719,Havent really found a need for one yet. My boat is low enough to the water for me to unhook and revive (if necessary) by hand. No problem man.
56162,irishfield,2007-04-06 18:00:00,26272,"Didn't have any issues with that rubber telescopic plucking your fish at BOQ though did yah Dano??  And Whopper ...       ...and it would also be great if your ""swinging"" fish actually made it to the boat! LOL  98F...I use a rubber telescopic for the medium stuff (bass/pickeral)   and I have a BIG stowmaster folding net that needs to be slimed this season. Pike I generally hand land."
56164,Whopper,2007-04-06 18:06:00,2174," Only lost one that way with you Wayne, That's my part of C&R ""Quick Release"" method.  Whopper"
56234,Dano,2007-04-06 20:39:00,719," No, but that wasnt my boat or my usual way to fish Wayne, and I'm not usually fishing in 100km winds and 4 foot waves."
56236,bpcbear2000,2007-04-06 20:44:00,25,I fell for the Cabela's Pro Series Landing Net  with the knotless bag
56237,irishfield,2007-04-06 20:45:00,26272,You saying you didn't want to lean over the side in that Dano....  98F...any issues with that net collapsing on you...since the hoop doesn't go all the way around. Looks like a fork with the net just stretched across.
56240,fishindevil,2007-04-06 20:56:00,6254,"i use a bass pro shops net,it has a large diameter with a telescopic handle,and has rubberized coating that prevents hooks from being caught in the mesh...its a great net and works well for salmon too,and it only cost about $45 bucks...thats a great price for the quality and its netted lots of salmon and has stood up to the abuse ...cheers"
56245,Mike the Pike,2007-04-06 21:30:00,3421,"  I use rubber myself it keeps me from having a little baby end up in a cradle.  Yes like Wayne I prefer the extendable rubber net,no more tangles more time fishing and much more gentle for releasing fish.  Whopper"
56246,Roy,2007-04-06 21:39:00,13728,"I usually land them by hand but if it's unsafe (pun intended) I use a 3804 26""x30"" Tru-Trax Landing Net. For muskies I now use the 8465 28""x50"" PowerCatch Kwik Kradle.  All Frabill."
56259,pikehunter,2007-04-06 22:38:00,1659, Seen them used for pike and musky.
56269,Roy,2007-04-06 23:09:00,13728,I hear ya pikehunter but I fish alone a lot of the time and they're pretty well useless for a lone fisherman. They are good for measuring fish in the water though.
56277,fishboy,2007-04-06 23:39:00,550,rubber-more gentle on the fish & doesn't snag your hooks
56284,lew,2007-04-06 23:47:00,12767,Frabill Big Game for me  
56285,Dondorfish,2007-04-06 23:49:00,1000,Lew - that net is bigger then my boat!!!   Don
56289,Greencoachdog,2007-04-06 23:56:00,8163,It's not really a landing net persay... but this is how I landed this Tiger Musky on Lake Seminole: 
56304,OhioFisherman,2007-04-07 00:48:00,6623,LOL Redneck! Tiger Muskie? are you sure it isn`t a walleye? Spring gaff or spear for me if they got teeth! Just kidding! LOL I like lipping fish!
56456,Guest Trophymuskie,2007-04-07 12:33:00,0,"You know what they say about men and their toys. I use a Frabill Big Kahuna, it large wide and deep. It's basically used as a pen to hold fish while unhooking."
