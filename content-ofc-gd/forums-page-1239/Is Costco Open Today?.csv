I watched a 'territorial' fight between 2 mink . . . .  musta been 'territorial, mating was over months ago. Those critters have to be the most vicious l'il animals I've ever seen . . . .     the loser finally retreated into the rocks under the bridge, but the 'winner' still tried to go after him for a good 5 minutes before heading into the underbrush along the creek. I never saw the loser come out? But . . .   nary even a line bump . ...   except for the ice pans. I had several people stop by, going home . . .    outta about 6 people, by 10:00, not one fish! Anybody going out today? CANADIAN COPPER? Is there gonna be trout available today?"
