56186,Jen,2007-04-06 18:44:00,833,I just wanted to say a special thank you to all the people that helped me in the last week.  I was in a three day course Tuesday -Thursday to obtain my Hunting Licence.  I would also like to make note that Tim Green was an awesome instructor!  There were several times where I found I needed help with the content or the slang in the conversations the guys were having during the course and found my answers through people here.  Thank you again to everyone for your help.  What a great group of people and an amazing resourse.  Couldn't have done it without you... 100% on exam!  Cheers Jen!!
