56668,Roy,2007-04-07 23:43:00,13728,"J went shopping (again) this morning. I was in the midst of finishing some bathroom renovations and was apprehensive as to what she was out shopping for. Anyhow I heard her arrive and winced as I yelled out ""what did you get?"". She didn't answer and just brought me two boxes and said ""happy Easter"". You just gotta love a 65 year old sweetie who goes to the trouble of finding an old prop in the garage and driving out to the marine dealer to get you some boat stuff. Bless her pointy little ears.....  "
