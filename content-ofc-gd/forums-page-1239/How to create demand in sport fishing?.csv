55839,iMetal,2007-04-05 22:26:00,11,"Well said Mark....thats what its all about ...get out and enjoy it...whatever course you may take.  The water is there for all of us to enjoy.  Be it doing 10 mph in my aluminum with my 9.9 hp or doing 74 mph in a Ranger of just cruising with the family on a pontoon boat catchin panfish.  There is something for all.  I just can't figure out why some people see tournament anglers as such bad people or as hurting the sport we all love????    Well I better stop now, someone may think I'm trying to sell something.  LOL"
55851,fliptheslop,2007-04-05 23:06:00,112,"Everyone asks whats wrong with the fishing industry, well heres my take on it. What is happening in this post is exactly what I have seen on so many other sites, CLUB BASHING CLUB< SERIES BASHING SERIES<, now  its ANGLER BASHING ANGLER   I love both aspects of what is being said here I love to go fishing with the family with no goal but to get away from every thing, I love to compete against others in tournys, which one is better, well that depends what day it is, when im in my small boat I love to see guys racing around in their big bass boats and wish I was racing against them to the honey hole, when im in my bass boat I see the guys huddled in their small boat, laughing or just sitting there enjoying what their doing flipin crappies in the boat, and I wish I was there. My point here is that if we all love to fish as much as we claim, why does there seem to be so much anger towards another group. I do get envolved with as many of the fishing for kids events as I can, and what I love most is the smiles and the happiness these kids get when they catch a fish, do they care what size my boat is, when they hold up that 4 inch perch they are at that moment the greatest fisherperson that ever lived, thats what fishing is about, so if you what to be in a club be in one if not dont, but I for one still want you tell me the story of your fishing trip"
55862,PatrickGG,2007-04-05 23:45:00,562,"Very well said Mark, I know where your coming from i grew up in the heart of Toronto ""Christie and Bloor"" i lost a few friends to drugs and other ways uncalled for but after having my first child i geared up and chose a better path i have 3 kids now a 12 year old daughter 7 year old daughter and a 5 year old son when we go to our bro-in laws cottage we do alot of fishing my older daughter loves it so does my second daughter as for my son he couldn't care less especially if we rent a boat he just looks foward to sleeping in it rather than fishing and it dont bother me one bit as long as hes chillin he seems to show more intrest if we are fishing on the dock i think hes kinda scared of being in a boat but i am really sure as he gets older he will enjoy it as a past time thing and if things change maybe its for the better if i see any of my kids wanting to pursue a sport fishing career i think i will back them up 100 percent whether it being a pro angler or any other job on the face of this planet."
55885,Moosebunk,2007-04-06 01:03:00,3970,I'm just totally blown away by all the posters here whose names I've never seen posting here before. lol.
55998,Marc Thorpe,2007-04-06 11:11:00,621,"Well if your heart is really into getting kids fishing  Start by looking at what www.takemefishing.org/  does http://www.fishingworks.com/kids_fishing/index.cfm http://www.aa-fishing.com/kids-fishing-trips.html (read each states value in creating intrigue) lots of tips  Set your club aside,use it as a collective assembly of aid only  Second,I think to innitiate kids in a competitive enviroment is not needed,As Chris S Stated it will naturally come  You really want to get kids fishing its simple,take them along the banks,fish a little,walk along the banks turn over rocks ,look for crayfish,frogs,tad poles,insects,bring them back home ,place them in an aquarium so the kids can observe em and nurture them,even put some local tiny fish caught or trap minnows Basicaily ya want to get kids into fishing,get em going the same we did as kids  We will not get kids into fishing trying to interest them into adult ways of fishing Its actually pretty simplistic  Too much focus on the ""fishing "" part of it You need the peak their interest in fishings entire surroundings  Anyone ever approach Hagens or any other aquarium manifacture to aid in such activities  JPD,great effort and works on your part with the kids in your local area schools"
56231,Loonietoon,2007-04-06 20:30:00,1450,"As some of you know, myself and family have been running a Fishing Derby for Kids now for 5 years for the kids at our trailer park and take great pride in helping kids with the fun part of fishing. Many of these kids when we started this derby did not own a fishing rod, now thanks to the sponsors we have (check out signature) this has all been made possible.. A couple of years ago I approached a Big name pro to show up to hand out prizes for the kids.. his response was seeing as it was going so good that he could help me with prizes only if he could incorporate it in with his company.  needless to say.. NO thanks We don't need you.. We have support from  another Big name that does not want to be recognized for what he is doing for this cause, but I think he is GREAT and he knows about this board also. This is all I have to say apart from the fact that we can all help kids by doing our part. I know that Rick (bigfish) also does 1 for people on Mothers Day weekend and I will be there to help out"
56252,Mike Pike,2007-04-06 22:16:00,1332,"Hey Marc Thorpe, what a terrific post and a great reminder!  Ya know, I've taken my daughter and nephews fishing many times in the past and I usually don't take my own rod so I can just concentrate on the little ones.  But my emphasis has always been on the 'fishing.'   I really haven't thought about the other aspects of taking children out to the great outdoors like you mentioned in your post.  The fun of collecting fish and just enjoying the wonders of a stream or lake is something that I think we as adults forget sometime.  I've got my niece and nephew coming up for a visit next month and you bet that I'll also include lots of fun nature time along with our fishing time.  Funny thing is, I think I'll enjoy it as much as the kids will!"
56585,POLLIWOGG,2007-04-07 19:45:00,835,I considered a tourny once but the rules disqualified my boat. I've done some engine mods that I estimate to put the motor around 250hp that gives me a terrifying 32mph on a good day.
56589,Jigger,2007-04-07 20:15:00,1237,"I agree with the ""Just take a kid fishing"" stance. Some of my earliest memories are of catching chub and small trout from small creeks. Along with that came the crayfish hunting, wildlife spotting, fort building... If you live in a newer suburb, maybe those things aren't readily available to your youngones. I think that all the catchbasins that are built around new suburbs should be stocked with fish to allow our young'uns access to fishing opportunities that may not be close by. If a child doesn't understand the joy of angling, they wont be as inclined to get into the competitive side later on in life.  As far as what can the tourney scene do to improve attendance, Make them affordable. If you can get boats out for $10-$20 a boat you'll get much bigger fields. And for those who do well in these formats, the bigger circuit would then have some appeal. For me, if I wanted to test my skills, I don't want to pay $250 for a days fishing. The entry money alone is intimidating. I'd be happy to walk away with a trophy saying ""Best Team"" and the gas money to cover the days cost. Just that the prize money is nice, but it would be easier for a dad to take his kid out for a day and have fun at a low cost."
56839,Marc Thorpe,2007-04-08 11:25:00,621,"Hey Mike it all comes down to thinking like kids,too many times we think like adults and try to get kids involved in adult ways Fishing is more than angling,more than catching Its everything in the surroundings of fishing that makes the experience what it is Watching your son on the ice that day quickly brought out what it is they seek in fishing  BTW,I got your minnow net"
55828,Mark Kulik,2007-04-05 21:44:00,348,"Well I wasn't going to post but here it goes, first off my engine is 200hp. why would calling me an idiot make someone feel good I don't know-I find jetski's really annoying , but guess what it's their right to run around on them! I have fished for everything in Ont. I've flyfished, steelheaded-pretty much for every specie, currently I fish competitevly, its my choice, but I certainly respect someone who chooses not to, I have 2 boys 5 and 7who love to fish with me , if they follow in my footsteps I'll support them if not thats great too, I participate in Daves Big Brothers /Sisters event and I really enjoy the look on the little guy's faces when they catch a fish, I grew up in rough area , and had a couple of freinds who died drug-related deaths, I chose to go the river instead, so any way to get new anglers young and old into fishing -competitevly or just for fun is a good thing!"
55833,Bernie,2007-04-05 22:18:00,3190,"To respond to the original question, in all organizations this issue raises its head. Our local gun club and Lions International ( I belong to both) can see the writing on the wall as well. A lot of the young folk have their interests elsewhere today. What is the answer? I cant say for sure but it is a question that is constantly asked I'm sure in all clubs and organizations. TV and internet/computing I'm sure have a big effect and personally cant see it improving in any manner. Sad really. There are more reasons people dont want to get involved in organizations too-lawsuits and risk can keep people away as well. Look at Boyscouts, to be a leader you need to go through personal background checks. Im not saying it's wrong to to that , I'm just saying it does discourage good people from doing it. Just keep plugging away at keeping interested people involved and it will continue, but doubt it will grow in any manner. Congratulations to those that do try!!!"
55374,POLLIWOGG,2007-04-04 21:09:00,835,"The # 1 thing to get more people into fishing is to drop the license because that wiped out a lot of occasional fishers.  In the late 80's salmon fishing was the hot ticket and a lot of fisherman invested heavily into offshore boats that might not be suitable for bass and eye tournies so that might have taken a chunk out of the # of fishers that might have gotten into them.  As for the big HP high speed thing, I had a guy go 3 miles out of his way so he could blast by me in a deep v offshore racer and rock my boat. It wasn't illegal just ignorant. On the other hand I've had a 1200 hp racing cat pass within 50' and not even rock our boat at all and that was way cool cause we were there to check out the boats. My point is that the faster most boats go the less wake they make so most guys aren't trying to pizz you off, they're trying not to rock your boat and unless they are reckless you should not be offended.  As one here stated guys buy these fast boats because of a short appendage, if this is so when someone complains about them are they truly offended or is it appendage envy."
55408,misfish,2007-04-04 22:25:00,29133,"WOW..............There has been some great responses.  JPD and David really put the hammer on the nail in thier responses.  I started out fishing just because I liked it,the whole family did it,heck, being a east coaster, if ya didnt like fish,n,you might as well be a blue noser.LOL . I like the competitiveness and meeting of new people during the tournies. I guess I did the cycle,was being a kid,fished for fun and enjoyed the sport and Im now like I said before,living a dream of just fishing in bass tournys. I still like those lazy days out there with my sons,friends and family,just keeps thing in perspective."
55422,mart,2007-04-04 23:23:00,93,"Just wondering what the chances are of getting funding from the government to start some kind of organization for involving kids and fishing? Probably the odds are pretty slim.For those that are dedicating their time and efforts for this cause, GREAT JOB!!!!! Kudos to Dave for his event that gives kids a chance to experience this great sport.I was part of the Big Brothers Organization growing up and will definitally be taking part in your event in the near future."
55427,Ben_Daniels,2007-04-04 23:43:00,435,People Like Mike Iaaconelli bring o much attention......just like in happy gilmore. I think people and personalities like him are what are going to get younger people fishing.
55439,hawg_hauler,2007-04-05 00:21:00,69,"As said before the sport of fishing here in Ontario is thriving and doing well. I have to assume that Frank is referring to generating more interest in the competitive side of sport fishing. In my opinion Canada will never achieve what the U.S. has shown us in competitive fishing tournaments. For starters, Canada has to cram all (lets use Bass for arguments sake) of it's seasons tourneys in a few months, compared to 12 months that the U.S. can. Second, you have to generate interest with the public, without spectators it would be very hard to move forward and honestly it is very hard to get crowds to wait all day just to see a couple of guys hold up fish for twenty seconds(in fact, it is hard enough to keep the contestants interested to stay if they know they wont be cashing a cheque and that in my opinion is poor sportsmanship). This is especially true in Canada where our summers are short enough to try to enjoy. This is also why sponsorship in Canada is much more difficult to attain, no spectators=no one there to advertise too=poor marketing decision.  As a tournament director myself, I am for the most part content with the scene in Canadian competitive fishing, as the most I can hope for anyone is the ability to have fun and enjoy the decisions that they have made, whether it be competitive or not.  Later, Jamie Busby"
55222,Terry,2007-04-04 14:33:00,14456,"I agree Brian we should have as big crowds as in the states...  except Bob and maybe Rocky, I don't think many non tourney guys know any top fishermen....and look how many we have on this board alone..most members don't even know the great pros we have here..I wonder how many know who Hank Gibson was and what he was the first to do.........."
55228,Bigfish,2007-04-04 14:46:00,19,"I will raise my kids with a competive and winning attitude, I want them to be the best! This is a big probelem today kids are not competive enough! Maybe this a reflection of one's upbring but that's the way I have been raised, and I would like to think that this attitude makes me who I am today! Its very competitve out in the real world, don't make them affraid of competion you should embrass it!"
