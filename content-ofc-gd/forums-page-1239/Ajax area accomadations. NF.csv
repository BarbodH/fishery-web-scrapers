56084,Woodsman,2007-04-06 15:14:00,1286,My brother inlaw will be working a  job in Ajax starting mid April for about a month. He is looking for a cottage or campground or motel with kitchenette within 45 mins from Ajax. Anyone have any sugestions?  Thanks: Rick

Moodie's Moter Inn 401 to Brock Road, not Brock Street in Whitby...........North 1/4 mile to Kingston Road (Hwy 2) East approx. 1/2 mile on the North Side of Hwy 2 just before the bridge over Duffins Creek. Your brother-in law  can chase Steelhead in the creek anywhere south of the CN railway when not at work."

There is a motel 6 even in whitby, quality in aswell stay clear of moodys though... Its the town joke!!! He can look on the website www.durhamregion.com  but god forbid he goes to moodies. Its old, dirty, and filled with people that will steal the pennies from a dead man. Check Port perry, Its right on Lake Scugog, Or find something close to Bomaville marina, pickering's frenchmans bay, or even the rouge river in Scarborough, there are lots of fish in these area's about to head up river to spawn,,"
