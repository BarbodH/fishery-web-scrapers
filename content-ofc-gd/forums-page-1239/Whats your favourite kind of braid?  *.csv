54904,BFSC Kevin,2007-04-03 19:41:00,1351,Also.. anyone tried or seen the stren sinking braid?? comments on that?
54911,xrap,2007-04-03 19:49:00,683,power pro is the only braided line i use.
54926,GbayGiant,2007-04-03 20:25:00,1780,"I picked PP, but different braids can be better at times. The spider-wire cuts through weeds better, and the Cortland super line is a lot thicker and almost floats like fly line, it's good for top waters or any time you want a high presentation.  Haven't herd of the sinking stren, but if it works it would be good at times for sure."
54949,ecxstriper,2007-04-03 21:53:00,343,I prefer the spider-wire  I fish mostly salt water  and it doesn't  seem to absorb the salt very much.

54955,Rich Clemens,2007-04-03 22:08:00,3131,I guess I can only pick one.  I use two kinds.  I use PP for musky and pike.  Stren superbraid for bass.  I hope to learn how to Walleye fish this year at our Lakair GTG with someone ... I'll have the Stren on those rods.
54989,Garyv,2007-04-04 00:00:00,547,I really like my Berkley trilene mono but do use Power Pro for conditions where braid is needed/necessary.  I have been having a lot of trouble hooking up while drifting for Walleye near the water treatment plant in Point Edward.  I was told to stop using the mono and change to a bait caster with braided line and a stiffer rod and you'll soon be catching fish.  Gave it a try and it works as you feel the light hit and can set the hook immediately without any stretch.  It may look and sound like overkill but it was great advice.

55027,Dutch,2007-04-04 01:16:00,831,As Roy indicated.  Check other thread.  I can't spend anymore time reading about this topic...lol.
55029,Northhunter,2007-04-04 01:22:00,214,Why the poll??  Gave my opinion already on the first thread.

55218,Fishmaster,2007-04-04 14:22:00,920,Stealth has allways been my Fav ..ive used Power Pro but don't like how it Fades white after alote of use ..3 years now my stealth is still green ..
56462,misfish,2007-04-07 12:53:00,29133,"Not to wory,some have no sense of humor  For you Power Pro users,check it out  Phantom Red"
56487,pigeonfisher,2007-04-07 13:58:00,696,corn rows like Allen Iverson.  I don't like what Chris Bosch has done with his braids.  If I recall at times Princess Leah had braids as well.  And don't forget the Spice Girls & Britney!
56571,mattyk,2007-04-07 18:47:00,2110,i dont leave home without power pro.
56634,Hank Jr,2007-04-07 22:11:00,146,My son and I have used power pro for the last 15 years with good results . I just purchased some of the newer Sufix braid and from what I seen so far it may be even better then the Power Pro. It cast farther and it is rounder and doesn't dig in on the spool as much as other braids.  Tight Lines Hank Jr
