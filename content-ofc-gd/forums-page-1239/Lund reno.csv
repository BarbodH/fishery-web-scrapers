56309,Jigger,2007-04-07 01:00:00,1237,"Well, got around to working on the old girl today. Started out by finishing some braces and small knick-knacky stuff that didn't warrant any pics, one brace that was bugging me got fixed...  Once the small stuff was out of the way, we got to cutting some plywood. Marking the doors to match the aluminum tubes was tricky but manageable. Also, I had to change plans midway due to a possible weakness if I constructed the rear platform by just adding another panel to the existing ones. So I had to remove all the existing bench panels that were there and decided to cut a full piece for the back...    Heres some pics of the front section...    I nixed the spinnerbait tray in the front as well, there was barely enough room for a spinnerbait by itself. If I put a trailer and hook on there they really bunched up and got caught on each other. A little dissapointing, but no big deal.  I brought all the plywood inside to get it ready for carpeting tomorrow. all I have to do beforehand is cut the hinges and were off to the races! Well, there IS still a bilge pump to install before the rear platform goes on, but I can still carpet the decking and doors.  Thanks for reading. Take it easy."
56314,Greencoachdog,2007-04-07 01:07:00,8163,"Good craftsmanship there, but i'd have chosen a different grade of plywood... but that's prolly just me."
56321,Jigger,2007-04-07 01:10:00,1237,"No better grade than free, GCD!   What grade would you use, just for future referance? Think maybe I should give it a seal before putting the carpet on? Thanks."
56322,GbayGiant,2007-04-07 01:11:00,1780,"Looks like a whole new boat, nice job.  Yup if it's not marine grade, slap some sealer on the wood and use marine carpet. Unless you really like building the deck and installing carpet, than you can build a new one every 3 or 4 years  ."
56339,Pigeontroller,2007-04-07 01:44:00,2793,Looking good!
56345,taper,2007-04-07 01:57:00,611,Very nice work.
56353,Greencoachdog,2007-04-07 02:14:00,8163, This is the stuff I used to redo my boat with: http://www.pontoonstuff.com/pontoon-boat/1...ine-plywood.asp
56390,ryanheritage,2007-04-07 03:12:00,180,Nice job I go back to work on my reno on sunday.. But you gotta admit how expensive is the aluminum??!!
56398,Jigger,2007-04-07 03:23:00,1237,"Thanks guys. Bookoo, its expensive stuff. But its there forever. No rust, no flex. I saved on plywood and carpet, and they can be dealt with at any time if they need to be replaced.  The frame will hopefully last as long as the boat does."
56399,ryanheritage,2007-04-07 03:25:00,180,Yeah I know its expensive I got mine at princess auto... You should thompson water seal or urathene that ply wood though.. It would hlep alot. Good luck and good job.. Looking forward to seeing the end result.
56418,BryceBurzynski,2007-04-07 03:56:00,181,Nice job!
56437,lew,2007-04-07 08:56:00,12767,"The job's coming along great Jigger, and thanks for letting us follow the progress.  Lookin forward to seeing the finished product."
56438,misfish,2007-04-07 10:24:00,29133,Good call on changing the back section. Much more support the way you did it.  Nice progress.
56464,glen,2007-04-07 13:14:00,2641,Nice work.  I was looking at some hatch covers and they sure are expensive.  Are you going to use wood for covers???
56477,b2kptbo,2007-04-07 13:41:00,1505,Loooooking goooood....
56478,Smokey,2007-04-07 13:45:00,1278,"Looks great so far, your doing a fine job that should be solid. Keep the updates coming."
56524,Jigger,2007-04-07 15:47:00,1237,"Thanks for the kind words guys. Glen, I don't think I'm going to get aluminum for the doors. Too expensive at this point. If/when I redo the deck in a couple of yrs, I will probably get the 3/4 marine grade ply. In that case I'd think about aluminum hatches due to the extra weight of the ply. But not this time. GCD thanks for the link. Some good info on lesser quality ply degrading marine grade carpet. That'll come in handy in the future. Take it easy."
