56465,solopaddler,2007-04-07 13:14:00,8605,"Well, I had it in my mind to head north on Friday to fish some Huron tribs, but the cold weather forecast forced me to look elsewhere. It was still pretty darn frigid though! Here's my buddy fishing the mouth area of one of my favourite spots. The wind and snow were howling in right off the lake and the cold overnight temps. created large packs of floating slush which we had to fish around...    Here's a decent fish caught by my bud          A chubby little hen that I caught further upstream      Another very decent fish I managed in the upstream sections    Near the end of the day we tried another rivermouth area. The wind chill was unreal and we were chilled to the bone in short order, but did manage a couple of chrome bullets before we packed it in and retreated to the car.        All in all a pretty good day despite the cold temperatures. We caught fish pretty consistently all day in pretty much every spot we tried. I think if the weather was a bit warmer it would have been an epic day, but no complaints!  BTW, for all those other fans of the Blue and White, big, big game tonight!  GO LEAFS GO!"

56592,solopaddler,2007-04-07 20:30:00,8605,"Thank's boys, appreciate it! Just to add to the story, when we arrived at the first spot to start the day my bud almost immediately hooked into a quality a fish and while fumbling to take pic's in the cold, the contact lens in my right eye popped out and fell in the river Needless to say I'm blind without either contacts or glasses, so I was ticked Anyone ever try concentrating on a float all day with one good eye and one bad eye? Not much fun let me tell ya! (I managed though  )"

Am I correct in assuming this is still the same place - I'm not sure I ""get it""...  However I see familiar names.  Cheers, Pete"
