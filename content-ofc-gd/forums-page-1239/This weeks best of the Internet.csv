I got to level 35 or something like that. http://www.handdrawngames.com/DesktopTD/DesktopTD12c.swf   Computer Stuff...  Ever wondered how to create special characters in your posts?

55982,SlowPoke,2007-04-06 07:54:00,2984,Level 46 and I have a plan... so much for sleeping. Thanks Rick   edit..... I completed all 50 EASY levels. Guess I know what I'm doing this weekend.

56492,OhioFisherman,2007-04-07 14:11:00,6623,LOL Rick build a maze it concentrates firepower.

56550,GbayGiant,2007-04-07 17:26:00,1780,"Yup,I got to level 50 on hard level. The key is using the cheap $5 shooters as a fence to control their movement with the fast shooting water towers positioned accordingly to pepper them as much as possible and upgrade the towers to full every time you get money, don't upgrade the fence, there's no need."
56576,Dutch,2007-04-07 19:06:00,831,"I have not tried the harder levels yet.  Finished it on easy.  After beating it my goal was to finish it on easy without losing any lives.  Very difficult task!  I have not been able to do it.  My PB so far is a score of 5391 with 17 lives left. My PB so far is a score of 5380 with 18 lives left. My PB so far is a score of 4507 with 19 lives left.  My strategy was to use the cheap towers and create a zig-zag maze all the way from top to bottom.  I would then level up 13 of the cheap towers (less money and they hit for more damage than the squirters).  This is how I got the 19 lives PB.  The only thing I couldn't kill with this strategy was the boss flyer at level 49.  It is by far the hardest thing to kill.  The missle launchers are the only way to do it that I have found and you need to level one all the way to the top and have another one leveled to the second highest level.  That takes a lot of gold though and by forgoing the shooters (missle launchers only work on planes) the boss on level 48 gets through.  If someone can determine a strategy to beat the easy level with 0 lives lost, let me know!  Great game Rick - thanks for making my long weekend one where I sit in front of the computer!"
56584,SlowPoke,2007-04-07 19:40:00,2984,I have done it with 19 lives as well with similar stratagy but I haven't broke 5000 pts. The boss flyer gets me too.
