When I position the motor (8HP Yamaha) on the left hand side of my main motor the tiller handle hits the left hand interior on the boat, in order to make a sharp right using the kicker I would have to elevate the handle on it's pivot. Is this normal? For info the tiller handle is on the left side of the kicker(looking from the back of the motor) and I cannot locate the kicker on the right side of the boat as this is where my swim platform is located."
