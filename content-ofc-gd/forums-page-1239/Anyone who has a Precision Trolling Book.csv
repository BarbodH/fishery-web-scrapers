It being a jerk bait, I'm thinking those depths are for casting only.  I was wondering if someone knows for sure, or has a Precision Trolling Book, can check the trolling depth of it?  I'll be using 30lb PP and SpiderWire with it.  Also looking into the trolling depth of the Lucky Craft Pointer if the DD goes deeper than I am looking for."
