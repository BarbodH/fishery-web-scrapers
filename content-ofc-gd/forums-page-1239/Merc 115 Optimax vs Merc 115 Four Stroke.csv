56555,Gerry,2007-04-07 17:43:00,257,"I agree with Lew, those old, carburator 2 strokes, spewed a lot of smoke and it wasn't pleasant to troll with them. The new 2 strokes (DFI) are entirely different and emit 'no smoke'. And I don't believe that the plugs get as fowled as they used to because the new DFIs' get little lubrication at low RPMs. I can't be absolutely sure about this however, because I don't run mine like that (i.e. at idle)."
56611,Fang,2007-04-07 21:18:00,1330,"Pooch  I run a 1750 Crestliner and a 115 HP Mers 2 stroke and have compared my performasnce tro alot of similar boats (Lund, Princecraft,...) and I get a few more MPH top speed than any four stroke. Gas consumption is pretty much similar and depends so much more on how you drive the boat that any statistics on paper.  Trophy Muskie said it best. If you plan to troll most of the time then go 4 stroke. If your gonna run and gun and spend more time of the trolling motor go Optimax.  If it was me I'd go Optimax and spend the extra $1000 and pick up a used 6HP four stroke and use it as a kicker. Better on the 115 HP down the road to keep the hours down. I troll salmon with my 115 2 stroke and by GPS I can hit 0.9 MPH slow troll."
56643,bassassin,2007-04-07 22:45:00,152,"Ive got a 90 opti on my Fisher hawk 170 sport, and for the first season going out at least twice a week i only used a bottle and a half of opti oil (5L).  It doesnt smoke at all and is quiet as a whisper, It has a 3star carb emmisions rating which is darn impressive.  Im a firm believer motors of that size perhaps arnt best for trolling at low speeds, we ended up purchasing a 9.9 merc 4stroke long shaft for trolling 2006 and our oprti is a 06.  Next step is purchasing a 22 pitch ss prop for the opti, for higher top end.  Just take the opti out for a test run and itll make the decision for you the best hole shot on the market, on plane in mere seconds."
56688,bigb,2007-04-08 00:04:00,5,Fang has the right idea get the opti and put the extra money towards a kicker. Saves miles on the big motor and you also have a second motor if a problem occurs. I just brought my new boat home the other day and have this arrangement.
56849,hawg_hauler,2007-04-08 12:17:00,69,"I believe Pooch said that a kicker wasn't an option. As for the point about keeping the hours off an engine, this point is only valid if your main concern is resale of the engine. the worst time for anything mechanical is down time. This is why the biggest phrase that a technician heres is ""I've hardly used it"". For the application I still have to recommend the Opti."
56064,pooch,2007-04-06 14:41:00,139,"Great info guys, very helpful. Most of the info you guys are talking about backs up what the dealer is saying. When I originally started looking for a boat, I just assumed I would put a 4 stroke on it. I was very surprised when the dealer explained an opti has BETTER gas consumption than the merc 4 stroke. 2 stroke technology is indeed improving rapidly.  I wanted to read all the replies on a straight up comparison, truth is I am a caster foremost and troller a distant second. From May-October I'm casting 90% of the time. I will also be in about a dozen fishing tournaments this year, no trolling there either. I troll for eyes on the BOQ at the end of the season, but don't think I should buy a motor just for that. A kicker is not really an option on this boat. I'd probably struggle with sock or trolling plate to slow the boat down for an occasional trolling outing.  Can you switch up props to slow down an opti? Would that screw up the WOT operation, I'm thinking it would.  Quietness is a great feature, that's for sure. I'll have to think more about that benefit."
56068,lew,2007-04-06 14:49:00,12767,"In 2001, I traded in a 90 Johnson 2 stroke, for a 90 Merc 4 stroke. The Merc weighed  85 pounds more but I only lost about 1 MPH which isn't even enough to worry about, at least not to me anyways.  Alot of folks seem really concerned about a slower hole shot with 4 stroke, but I honestly didn't notice any  difference, and besides, I'm going fishing, not drag racing. Maybe there's a noticible difference on hole shot speed as the HP increases, but I spose it's all what you find important.  I have friends with 2 strokes in the 90-135 HP range and can't honestly see where their hole shots are any faster than mine, comparatively speaking.  I do like the quietness of 4 strokes and the fact that I can troll all day long without it fouling the plugs, and even after 8 hours trolling and I hit the throttle, it's instantaneous with no sluggishness till it ""clears"" itself and the lack of blue smoke is a definate plus.  Plenty of power and excellent fuel economy, specially at slower speeds.  I do agree with Nippissing though, the old 2 strokes had a bad rep, and it was certainly warranted, but things definetely seem to have changed in the last few years as the technology improves and many folks prefer newer 2 stroke over  the 4.  I've heard it said that any Merc 90 HP and under your better with 4 stroke and over 90 HP go with Opti.  Good luck with whatever you decide on Pooch, I think either one will be a good choice for you."
56449,Guest Trophymuskie,2007-04-07 12:14:00,0,"It's a simple choice it you plan on using the motor to troll then get the 4 stroke and if not then get the Optimax. And you should get better gas mileage with the Opti as well as power, weight.  I would suggest with any of the bigger motors like Lew mentioned, anything under 90 should be 4 stroke but the power difference in the bigger motors is significant."
56496,Gerry,2007-04-07 14:20:00,257,"Pooch, changing to a smaller prop isn't the answer because, yes, you will lose some top end speed. But more importantly, you'll risk over revving the engine which can cause it to detonate. As for a trolling plate, I'm just not sold on those things. When trolling for walleye, sometimes you need to slow to a crawl (i.e. 1.0 mph or less) and a 115 will probably not go any slower than 1.8 to 2.0 mph. That lack of flexibility will, in all likelyhood, see your catch rate go down. I now when I'm fishing for walleye up north I use my electric motor to pull me along at speeds as low as 0.2 mph. Obviously, I can't put a kicker on my bassboat so when I go to Quinte I jump in with a buddy who is properly equiped, Ranger Fisherman, 200 Opti & 9.9 Merc 4 stroke kicker.  Hope this helps."
56510,eye-tracker,2007-04-07 15:12:00,89,"Just as an option for trolling with the optimax you may want to look at a 5 blade High Five prop and the SmartCraft Tach and Speedo gauges so you can control RPM with the troll control features. If you do lots of trolling, you may have to change or clean plugs a little more than normal if you notice a decrease in the performance of the opti  during the fishing season.  I guess with the recent invention of 4 strokes people started trolling, not sure what we did when all we had was 2 stroke motors.  I think you will be fine with either motor, just prop it right for trolling.  Enjoy your new rig.  -s"
56512,irishfield,2007-04-07 15:13:00,26272,My 115 Johnson 2 stroke on my Glastron idled at over 3mph. Two buckets out and two rigger balls in the water for extra drag just got us down to 1.8 to 2.1 mph.
56547,lew,2007-04-07 17:19:00,12767," Well, when all we had was 2 strokes, we sucked in alot of stinking blue exhaust smoke all day for one thing, plus we either cleaned or changed our spark plugs every few trips.  The good ole days weren't always that good"
56554,eye-tracker,2007-04-07 17:39:00,89,You are right there Lew... I remember when I use to back-troll on purpose into the exhaust fog to stop the bugs from eating me alive. Now days most of the DFI 2 strokes burn pretty clean.  -s
