The Canadians are wearing their toques and drinking and carrying on having a good time. Satan is surprised to see they're not in misery so he cranks up the heat.  Satan comes back again to see if the Canadians are suffering. Again he finds them drinking and partying, having a great time. So Satan asks them, ""What's wrong with you guys? Isn't it hot enough for you? Everyone else here is in misery and you guys are happy."" The Canadian reply, ""We come from the land of ice and snow, we're happy to warm up a bit.""  So next day Satan cranks up the heat to full. All the minions of Hell are gasping for breath, sweating and in total misery. Satan comes back to check on the Canadians. Stunned, he finds them again laughing and drinking and barbecuing some hamburgers and asks why they're so happy. ""After so many long cold winters, we love the heat, bring it on!!"" say the Canadians.  So Satan, totally furious, thinks about ways to punish the Canadians. ""Aha! If they're enjoying the heat so much, I'll take it away from them."" So Satan turns off the Hellfires.  Next day, icicles are forming in the cavernous depths of hell. All the condemned souls of Hell are shivering and suffering in the cold. So Satan checks in on the Canadians. He finds them happier than ever, wearing their toques, jumping up and down laughing and hollering, empty beer bottles strewn all about. He asks them, "" What is your problem? I turn up the heat all the way you don't suffer. I turn off the heat, you don't suffer. What the hell is wrong with you guys? Why are you always so happy?""  The Canadians reply, ""Don't you know, Hell froze over, it means the Leafs must have won the Cup!"""
