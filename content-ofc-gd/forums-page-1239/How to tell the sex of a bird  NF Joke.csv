I always thought it had to be determined surgically or that they were different colours.  Until Now.  Which of The Two Birds Is a Female?  Below are Two Birds. Study them closely... See If You Can Spot Which of The Two Is The Female. * It can be done even by one with limited bird watching skills. * * * * * * * * * * *  * Send this to all of the men you know, who could do with a good laugh and to all women who have a great sense of humor....
