56343,taper,2007-04-07 01:55:00,611,"I got these with a bunch of tackle I bought second hand, does any one know what they are and what type of presentation I would use with them.  "
56348,Bob,2007-04-07 02:04:00,370,They look like Mepps minnows.
56365,irishfield,2007-04-07 02:32:00,26272,"I'll dispose of them for you Taper, if you'd like! LOL  I think they'd work well on the end of cow bells / christmas trees for lakers."
56370,OhioFisherman,2007-04-07 02:35:00,6623,Ya some of the mepps spinners came with minnows on them that looked like those.
56374,Greencoachdog,2007-04-07 02:38:00,8163,"Them there is ""Stump Snaggers""!!!  Made for trollin' thru stump fields, to check the smoothness of the drag system on your reel."
56381,GbayGiant,2007-04-07 02:49:00,1780,"How big are they ? where are the weighted ? they look the swim baits/jerk baits try casting them out with little downward twitches. It's hard to say from the pics, not sure what they are."
56383,Dondorfish,2007-04-07 02:52:00,1000,I think that I once had a Mepps Cyclops with a minnow on it that looked like that - till a big pike took it away from me!   Don
56507,walleyejigger,2007-04-07 14:57:00,876,they look almost like the jigging raps for ice fishing
56511,Cookslav,2007-04-07 15:12:00,1457,I'll second the mepps minnow... I have one from days past n My box.  I've never seen them sold seperate from the Spinner though?
56515,musky66,2007-04-07 15:28:00,273,Either make your own or rig them up behind existing Mepps style spinners- should be deadly for Pike?Musky etc...
56516,misfish,2007-04-07 15:28:00,29133," I would say you could almost dropshot them puppys. I did see something very simular to these a guy in the states was using,his only had the front treble hang,n off it.  Want to sell or trade a couple   I think the minnow is to well defined to be for/from those mepps spinners."
56549,ryanheritage,2007-04-07 17:23:00,180,dropp shot them... If you put them behind a spinner or your planning on pulling them through the water you gota do it real slow.. They will just turn without looking like a minnow. I would put a bit of weight on the front of them a pull them along bottom.. Or give to the kids to use off the dock. I remember having a blue fox set up with those minnows behind a spinner and when I checked the action I chucked the lure. Too bad they didn't have single hooks thought them instead they would be good to throw into weed poeckets....
