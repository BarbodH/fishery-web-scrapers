When I opened it was a rock hard lump rather than the mouldable ""puddy"" type of stuff i expected. Is this normal? I can hardly figure out how to get it on a hook looking reasonable. When in the store I noticed that the non-floating stuff was already in individual chunks but all of the floating seemed to be in one big chunk so i thought nothing of it.  So should i be taking it back to ""Crappy"" Tire or is there some way to use this stuff. While on the topic, any opinions about how well the Trout Powerbait works?  Thanks for the advice and good luck out there on this long weekend!!"

If they are all solid it could mean it don't work and nobody wants to buy it, I use the bublegum stuff for fishing a stocked quarry for trout."
56280,express168,2007-04-06 23:43:00,327,Take it back it is supposed to be soft  and moldalbe. It has probably been on the shelf for a while.
56287,bassmaster4,2007-04-06 23:51:00,801,does that stuff even work i bought a jar and used half all i got was panfish on it
56354,charlied,2007-04-07 02:15:00,584,then it works...you caught fish...LOL
56400,cwood,2007-04-07 03:25:00,16,Thanks everyone. I'll be at the front of the returns line tomorrow morning and hopefully have some new stock for tomorrow's fishing.  Anymore reviews of the trout powerbait itself is still appreciated!  Cheers
56407,xrap,2007-04-07 03:40:00,683,"I wouldn't even buy that stuff from the jars. If I use you and I was looking for steelhead stuff, I'd take the berkley powerbait trout worms in pink (3""). Good stuff for trout."
56490,bassmaster4,2007-04-07 14:05:00,801, lol i meant for trout should have been more specific
