56709,Heybud_e,2007-04-08 00:52:00,208,"ok was cleaning out my garage a little bit, hanging in the rafters i found a 7ft St. Croix Premiere / PM70MHF Med Heavy Action 1 pc pole, did some research and turns out it is a musky rod???  i would like to find a reel to fit???  any suggestions?? thanks....Bud"
56714,SlowPoke,2007-04-08 00:56:00,2984,"Be careful, when stored in rafters those St. Croix's become unstable and could blow apart at any moment leaving you scared for life. I'll come by and pick it up for you.  How much would you like to spend for a reel?"
56721,Heybud_e,2007-04-08 01:01:00,208,"well i wouldnt want to a rediculous amount but i am open to a price range of $20 - $150,"
56723,OhioFisherman,2007-04-08 01:02:00,6623,"Just depends on your spare change, Abu 6500- 6501 will do on a budget, like 80 bucks stateside. Curado 300 might be a good reel like 250 bucks here. Depends on your cash flow."
56728,Zib,2007-04-08 01:12:00,369,An Abu Garcia C3 or C4 is a great reel for muskies. A Shimano Calcutta is also good. If you're going to be throwing a lot of bucktails go with a high speed reel.
56730,Heybud_e,2007-04-08 01:18:00,208,"well i have never caughten or tried fishing for musky before, so i have no slight clue heh, gonna look again tomorrow in the rafters, cause i faintly seen a what looked like a tackle bag, so... i may have struck gold perhaps..."
56731,fishdawg,2007-04-08 01:23:00,912,"sure wish i was able to ""just find"" stuff like that in my garage"
56734,Heybud_e,2007-04-08 01:37:00,208,is there some kind of value to this pole i dont know about? lol
56735,SlowPoke,2007-04-08 01:40:00,2984,It's a very nice Muskie rod worth about $140 new. Cast or troll it do both well.
56738,Heybud_e,2007-04-08 01:42:00,208,"ahhh, it looks really clean, feels clean, cork handle is dirty,  i just need a truck to put it in"
56739,SlowPoke,2007-04-08 01:44:00,2984,"I have a truck, you're welcome to leave it in there."
56749,Heybud_e,2007-04-08 01:52:00,208,lol... may just end up on ebay.. ya never know... i actually want to get into Salmon/steelhead fishing...
