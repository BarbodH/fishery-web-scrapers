56031,krawler,2007-04-06 13:51:00,167,"Just needed to share my news with somebody.  its been a dream of mine for a couple of years and finally coming true.  the boat is a 1600 Alaskan SS with a 75hp yamaha 4 stroke!!!  boat being delivered in early june.  called every marina in ontario and found a price $3 g's less than everyone else.  really happy.  Been asking a lot of boat related questions on the board recently and would like to thank everyone for there thoughts and opinions.  a lot of knowledgeable folks on here and i value your opinions.  now saving for some dipsy equipment for lake o, already have the riggers, additional transducers for fish finder and im all set.  camping with a lund on northern lakes should be awesome too ... oh and need a bow mounted trolling motor too ... that will be my next question coming up.  thanks again   krawler"
