Seriously though, if you have ever walked along a river bed and looked up at the 'clay-banks' you will see strata of inches or more separated by feet (so I am guessing at least thousands of years) and a few good really dark bands in there ... maybe meteors .. who knows ... But I figure the REAL concern for global weather (based on all the pockmarks you can see on every other heavenly body) is when the next meteor will hit and where .... or when the next Mt St Helen will happen .. thats much more likely to effect the weather me thinks .... and in a fast meaningful (not likely to be good) way  By the way ... if anyone wants to see Dinosaur tracks they are there all the way up the creek in my back yard"
56468,John Bacon,2007-04-07 13:19:00,3277,"I saw this posted on the rogers site today.  It contains some interesting opinions on the global warming debate.  http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20070407/ap_on_...MNejDlV5pNxieAA     Just in case the link doesn't work...  By CAIN BURDEAU, Associated Press Writer Sat Apr 7, 2:55 AM ET  NEW ORLEANS - A top hurricane forecaster called Al Gore ""a gross alarmist"" Friday for making an Oscar-winning documentary about global warming. ADVERTISEMENT  ""He's one of these guys that preaches the end of the world type of things. I think he's doing a great disservice and he doesn't know what he's talking about,"" Dr. William Gray said in an interview with The Associated Press at the National Hurricane Conference in New Orleans, where he delivered the closing speech.  A spokeswoman said Gore was on a flight from Washington, D.C., to Nashville Friday; he did not immediately respond to Gray's comments.  Gray, an emeritus professor at the atmospheric science department at Colorado State University, has long railed against the theory that heat-trapping gases generated by human activity are causing the world to warm.  Over the past 24 years, Gray, 77, has become known as America's most reliable hurricane forecaster; recently, his mentee, Philip Klotzbach, has begun doing the bulk of the forecasting work.  Gray's statements came the same day the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change approved a report that concludes the world will face dire consequences to food and water supplies, along with increased flooding and other dramatic weather events, unless nations adapt to climate change.  Rather than global warming, Gray believes a recent uptick in strong hurricanes is part of a multi-decade trend of alternating busy and slow periods related to ocean circulation patterns. Contrary to mainstream thinking, Gray believes ocean temperatures are going to drop in the next five to 10 years.  Gore's documentary, ""An Inconvenient Truth,"" has helped fuel media attention on global warming.  Kerry Emanuel, an MIT professor who had feuded with Gray over global warming, said Gray has wrongly ""dug (his) heels in"" even though there is ample evidence that the world is getting hotter."

Has anybody just heard about the 24+ hours spent discussing GW at a un summit? 2300-2500 scientists have done their homework and have informed the UN that GW is real, 30% of the worlds animals and fauna are looking at extinction with a 2degree increase. And we are talking by the year 2050. The GW has been proven hands down without a doubt now... The reason we are having this type of weather is a direct effect of GW. It will be causing alot more strange weather... So hold on... I know this debate and thread has been going on for awile , Im tired of it too... BUT they have (the UN) have come to the agreement GW is real and it is a serious problem. The fact that we keep talking about how crazy the weather is lately should be enough for us to realize that their is something behind all the talk on GW. Any how I am done.... THe only thing I can do now is update with links.. So to all in this debate..... Keep your parka, umbrella,sunscreen, hats, ice skates, skis, life jackets, fresh water, at the door that way you will be prepared for any day comming... lol"

56619,John Bacon,2007-04-07 21:39:00,3277," Even the UN scientists are not as certain as you about the cause of global warming.  I beleive the term they was was ""Basically Certain"", which translates to 90% certainty.  Thus even the scientists who support the human cause of global warming have allowed for a 10% chance that they are wrong, or 10% of doubt that humans are the cause of global warming.  So, no, it has not been proven beyond a doubt.  Debate is good, opposing view points should not be silenced.  A majority opinion is not proof.  It is important that all view points, not just the popular ones, are heard."

56691,ryanheritage,2007-04-08 00:10:00,180,"An international panel of climate scientists said yesterday that there is an overwhelming probability that human activities are warming the planet at a dangerous rate, with consequences that could soon take decades or centuries to reverse.  The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, made up of hundreds of scientists from 113 countries, said that based on new research over the last six years, it is 90 percent certain that human-generated greenhouse gases account for most of the global rise in temperatures over the past half-century.  Declaring that ""warming of the climate system is unequivocal,"" the authors said in their ""Summary for Policymakers"" that even in the best-case scenario, temperatures are on track to cross a threshold to an unsustainable level. A rise of more than 3.6 degrees Fahrenheit above pre-industrial levels would cause global effects -- such as massive species extinctions and melting of ice sheets -- that could be irreversible within a human lifetime. Under the most conservative IPCC scenario, the increase will be 4.5 degrees by 2100.  MORE:::::: Sat Mar 31, 6:34 PM ET    From the micro to the macro, from plankton in the oceans to polar bears in the far north and seals in the far south, global warming has begun changing life on Earth, international scientists will report next Friday.  Changes in climate are now affecting physical and biological systems on every continent,"" says a draft obtained by The Associated Press of a report on warming's impacts, to be issued by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), the authoritative U.N. network of 2,000 scientists and more than 100 governments.  In February the panel declared it ""very likely"" most global warming has been caused by manmade emissions of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases.  Animal and plant life in the Arctic and Antarctic is undergoing substantial change, scientists say. Rising sea levels elsewhere are damaging coastal wetlands. Warmer waters are bleaching and killing coral reefs, pushing marine species toward the poles, reducing fish populations in African lakes, research finds.  ""Hundreds of species have already changed their ranges, and ecosystems are being disrupted,"" said University of Michigan ecologist Rosina Bierbaum, former head of the U.S. IPCC delegation. ""It is clear that a number of species are going to be lost.""  The IPCC draft estimates that if temperatures rise approximately 2 to 4 degrees Fahrenheit more, one-third of species will be lost from their current range, either moved elsewhere or vanished."
56692,ryanheritage,2007-04-08 00:12:00,180,"UN to issue bleak global warming report Global warming could cause more hunger in Africa and melt most Himalayan glaciers by the 2030s, according to a draft UN report due out on Friday.  The report will also warn that the poorest nations are likely to suffer most.  The UN climate panel, giving the most authoritative study on the regional impact of climate change since 2001, also predicts more heatwaves in countries such as the United States, and damage to coral including Australia's Great Barrier Reef.  ""We are talking about a potentially catastrophic set of developments,"" said UN Environment Program head Achim Steiner.  ""Even a half-metre rise in sea levels would have catastrophic effects in Bangladesh and some island states.""  Scientists and officials from more than 100 countries meet in Belgium from Monday to review and approve a 21-page summary for policy-makers in the report amid disputes on some findings, including on how far rising temperatures may contribute to spreading disease.  Among the gloomy forecasts, the report predicts that glaciers in the Himalayas, the world's highest mountain range, will melt away, affecting hundreds of millions of people.  ""If current warming rates are maintained, Himalayan glaciers could decay at very rapid rates, shrinking from the present 500,000 square kilometres to 100,000 square kilometres by 2030s,"" according to a draft technical summary.  And disruptions are likely to be felt hardest in poor nations, such as sub-Saharan Africa and Asia where millions more could go hungry because of damage to farming and water supplies.  But some nations will see some benefits, according to the draft by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) which draws on work by 2,500 scientists.  Global farm potential might increase with a rise of 3 degrees Celsius in temperatures, before sinking worldwide, it says.  Crops might grow better in nations far from the tropics such as Canada, Russia, New Zealand or Scandinavia."

What, a new 25 year world wide patent. great news"
56160,Bob,2007-04-06 17:56:00,370,"Ozone is funny stuff.  In the upper atmosphere, it's wonderful stuff but at ground level, it's pollution.  I don't know if CFCs made the holes at the poles in the ozone layer but it strikes me that the ozone layer thins and thickens pretty regularly.  Maybe it's something that's been going on forever?  I was born a redhead and sunburn has been something I lived with all my life.  From about 1950, I've seen many cycles where for a few years I've had to be real careful and then for a few years it was no problem.  Been back and forth like that since I was a little kid.  In the late 40s and early 50s, every country with the capacity was testing atom bombs and hydrogen bombs.  All looking for the biggest stick.  Megatons of radioactive dust were pumped into the atmosphere and it spread worldwide.  Suddenly certain diseases were spiking, the most noticable being lung cancer but diabetes was in there too.  Into the early 60s, there was a mad scramble of scientists looking for something (other than radiation which we KNOW causes cancer) to blame it on and they chose tobacco.  Now, since about 1990 the US is testing and using ""depleted"" uranium ammunition and atmospheric radiation is rising again. Once again, there's a big push to demonise tobacco in the last 10 or 15 years.  Now this depleted uranium is great stuff, it penetrates stuff real well, specifically tank armour and underground bunkers.  The only problem is, it puts radioactive dust into the atmosphere and has a half life of about 4 billion years.  Bees are disappearing worldwide and there's fear that soon there won't be enough of them to pollinate crops.  Some folks think this has something to do with genetically modified crops with the built in pesticide.  Pollen from these gm crops blows around and it's spreading these genetics everywhere.  Farmers in the western provinces are being sued by Monsanto because their GM crap has been found growing in ditches beside their fences and they aren't licensed to grow the stuff.  Who'd want to?  Forgive me for being a cynic but I saw the coming ice age headlines 30 years ago and I think there are far bigger problems today than what's coming out of my tailpipe."
51983,Golfisher,2007-03-26 15:58:00,586,"The consensus view IS precisely what I said, that climate change is not only real but also anthropogenic.  Read the Science article yourself, and then tell me that there is no scientific consensus on the role of human activities on climate change:  ""The Scientific Consensus on Climate Change""  Naomi Oreskes*  Policy-makers and the media, particularly in the United States, frequently assert that climate science is highly uncertain. Some have used this as an argument against adopting strong measures to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. For example, while discussing a major U.S. Environmental Protection Agency report on the risks of climate change, then-EPA administrator Christine Whitman argued, ""As [the report] went through review, there was less consensus on the science and conclusions on climate change"" (1). Some corporations whose revenues might be adversely affected by controls on carbon dioxide emissions have also alleged major uncertainties in the science (2). Such statements suggest that there might be substantive disagreement in the scientific community about the reality of anthropogenic climate change. This is not the case.  The scientific consensus is clearly expressed in the reports of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). Created in 1988 by the World Meteorological Organization and the United Nations Environmental Programme, IPCC's purpose is to evaluate the state of climate science as a basis for informed policy action, primarily on the basis of peer-reviewed and published scientific literature (3). In its most recent assessment, IPCC states unequivocally that the consensus of scientific opinion is that Earth's climate is being affected by human activities: ""Human activities ... are modifying the concentration of atmospheric constituents ... that absorb or scatter radiant energy. ... [M]ost of the observed warming over the last 50 years is likely to have been due to the increase in greenhouse gas concentrations"" [p. 21 in (4)].  IPCC is not alone in its conclusions. In recent years, all major scientific bodies in the United States whose members' expertise bears directly on the matter have issued similar statements. For example, the National Academy of Sciences report, Climate Change Science: An Analysis of Some Key Questions, begins: ""Greenhouse gases are accumulating in Earth's atmosphere as a result of human activities, causing surface air temperatures and subsurface ocean temperatures to rise"" [p. 1 in (5)]. The report explicitly asks whether the IPCC assessment is a fair summary of professional scientific thinking, and answers yes: ""The IPCC's conclusion that most of the observed warming of the last 50 years is likely to have been due to the increase in greenhouse gas concentrations accurately reflects the current thinking of the scientific community on this issue"" [p. 3 in (5)].  Others agree. The American Meteorological Society (6), the American Geophysical Union (7), and the American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS) all have issued statements in recent years concluding that the evidence for human modification of climate is compelling (8).  The drafting of such reports and statements involves many opportunities for comment, criticism, and revision, and it is not likely that they would diverge greatly from the opinions of the societies' members. Nevertheless, they might downplay legitimate dissenting opinions. That hypothesis was tested by analyzing 928 abstracts, published in refereed scientific journals between 1993 and 2003, and listed in the ISI database with the keywords ""climate change"" (9).  The 928 papers were divided into six categories: explicit endorsement of the consensus position, evaluation of impacts, mitigation proposals, methods, paleoclimate analysis, and rejection of the consensus position. Of all the papers, 75% fell into the first three categories, either explicitly or implicitly accepting the consensus view; 25% dealt with methods or paleoclimate, taking no position on current anthropogenic climate change. Remarkably, none of the papers disagreed with the consensus position.  Admittedly, authors evaluating impacts, developing methods, or studying paleoclimatic change might believe that current climate change is natural. However, none of these papers argued that point.  This analysis shows that scientists publishing in the peer-reviewed literature agree with IPCC, the National Academy of Sciences, and the public statements of their professional societies. Politicians, economists, journalists, and others may have the impression of confusion, disagreement, or discord among climate scientists, but that impression is incorrect.  The scientific consensus might, of course, be wrong. If the history of science teaches anything, it is humility, and no one can be faulted for failing to act on what is not known. But our grandchildren will surely blame us if they find that we understood the reality of anthropogenic climate change and failed to do anything about it.  Many details about climate interactions are not well understood, and there are ample grounds for continued research to provide a better basis for understanding climate dynamics. The question of what to do about climate change is also still open. But there is a scientific consensus on the reality of anthropogenic climate change. Climate scientists have repeatedly tried to make this clear. It is time for the rest of us to listen.  References and Notes   A. C. Revkin, K. Q. Seelye, New York Times, 19 June 2003, A1.

51602,tleriche,2007-03-25 16:11:00,1,"I agree with bucktail when he said:  ""Global warming is irrelevant in the fact that all programs that would reduce greenhouse gas emissions benefit humanity by reducing air and water pollution. Something that with 6.5 billion humans cannot be argued against.""  The people who try to find the opposite side of the global warming debate really have their priorities mixed up.  Even if you don't believe that humans are part of the cause of this problem, what issue do you have with cleaning up the environment in which we live?  Cleaner air, cleaner water foster the wilderness that most of hold so dear.  Pollution destroys fish and waterfowl habitat.  I could go on for days, but whats the point.  I think it really comes down to the 'Who Moved my Cheese Syndrome'.  People always resist change.  The older generation are comfortable with their gas guzzling SUVs and their high powered homes.  People who resist change are simply defending their way of life.  It will take a generation or two before humans change the way we live, but unfortunately it'll probably be too late.  All we can do is try.  BTW - Here is a good example of what can be done.  There was a big debate about CFC's back in the 70's and 80's with regard to its effects on the Ozone layer.  After much debate most countries banned the use of CFC's.  In 1975, the US state of Oregon enacted the world's first ban of CFCs (legislation introduced by Walter F. Brown). The United States and several European countries banned the use of CFCs in aerosol spray cans in 1978, but continued to use them in refrigeration, foam blowing, and as solvents for cleaning electronic equipment. By 1985, scientists observed a dramatic seasonal depletion of the ozone layer over Antarctica. International attention to CFCs resulted in a meeting of world diplomats in Montreal in 1987. They forged a treaty, the Montreal Protocol, which called for drastic reductions in the production of CFCs. On March 2, 1989, 12 European Community nations agreed to ban the production of all CFCs by the end of the century. In 1990, diplomats met in London and voted to significantly strengthen the Montreal Protocol by calling for a complete elimination of CFCs by the year 2000. By the year 2010 CFCs should be completely eliminated from developing countries as well."

Here is the 1st grade definition   Photosynthesis (photo=light, synthesis=putting together), generally, is the synthesis of sugar from light, carbon dioxide and water, with oxygen as a waste product. It is arguably the most important biochemical pathway known; nearly all life depends on it. It is an extremely complex process, comprised of many coordinated biochemical reactions. It occurs in higher plants, algae, some bacteria, and some protists, organisms collectively referred to as photoautotrophs.

Since it is 1st grade level stuff, how is it so hard to see each and every one of us should being doing our part for the environment.The thing about global warming isn't that we as humans are creating more C02 but in fact we are the reason that it is not being filtered properly, which in turn makes it human error that's causes the excess in C02."

Then , one day many years down the road, when there are few of us left, and all the ingenuity that has ever been created is destroyed , we will start from the beginning , as hunters and gatherers . Maybe we will have three legs , maybe three arms , but one thing's for sure , we can't destroy a planet , we can only alter it . Be glad knowing that you won't be around to experience all the long term effects ."
