56657,fishindevil,2007-04-07 23:19:00,6254,"Thats a great little rigger for walleyes or lake trout.for sure and $50 bucks is a steal,its not a heavy duty boom and would be ok for a 7-10lb ball no problem and its a manual rigger as well,but for someone fishing for those species as well as rainbow trout its great because it has a short boom and one pulley it would be very difficult to get the boom over the side of even a medium sized boat it would more suit a boat with narrower sides i have also seen these small riggers on the transome of smaller boats in lakes where guys use them for lakers,they work really well and are made of tough plastic and will last forever .for a place like quinte and to run a 4lb ball for walleyes its PERFECT....maybe lew would be interested    cheers"
