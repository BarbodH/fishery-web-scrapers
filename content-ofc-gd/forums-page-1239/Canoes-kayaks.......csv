56422,danbo,2007-04-07 04:10:00,2646,Here's a cool link too...  paddling link here-
56425,ryanheritage,2007-04-07 04:43:00,180,nice one dano... this will be my first one.. I kayaked a couple times in banff when I used to live out west. Ever since then I have always been thinking about doing it again.. Are you from Ontario? where do you paddle?
56426,Pinch,2007-04-07 04:59:00,231," Nice Yak, now all you have to do is pimp it out with a fishfinder and a couple of rod holders and your all set."
56431,danbo,2007-04-07 05:23:00,2646,"Heck I use it everywhere, mouth of the Credit River surfing the waves or paddle upstream for smallies. Great on any small lakes too. Back bays for bass & pike or even carp. Get yourself a good 2 piece wooden paddle, their super light for a long day fishin! Keep your arms stretched out over your shins when you paddle..then push forward on the paddle that's in the air while ya pull on the one in the water,& turn your upper body with each stroke. Practice swishing your paddle side-to-side with the blade flat on top of the water, its how you save yourself from falling in! Think of the water's surface like its a table top that you can balance on. Wiggle your butt & lean over to see how far you can get while bracing with that technique! If you ever do tip over, just exit the boat..don't try to roll it. That's only for tight cockpit boats. I carry a nylon bag that I fill with rocks to use as an anchor. Great fun!!"
56822,ryanheritage,2007-04-08 05:42:00,180,"So i got my kayaks, and I was impressed... I didn't think I would be getting a great boat but they turned out better then expected. His brand name is upper canada paddle company. I suggest anyone that is intrested give him a shout Had some nice canoes and kayaks.. he gave me two, two piece aluminum handle day tripper paddles, two kayaks, two spray skirts, all for 750.00.. It was a bit of a drive to tweed but it was worth it I saved over 400 total."
56996,lunkerbasshunter,2007-04-08 18:16:00,2585,that is a great deal!!!
57015,glirw,2007-04-08 18:57:00,200,"Looks great man ! Congrats !  Now all you gotta do is attach two rod holders , one to the front one to the back , and find space for a tackle box !"
