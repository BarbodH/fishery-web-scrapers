Drfited the same pool for about 20 mintues then I made my lead a bit longer and first drift boom I had her on an the line snapped imdiatley when she started to pull. I forgot to change my drag early because I had a snag so i tightened it to brake it off and didn't change. Oh well my fault"

56435,Photoz,2007-04-07 08:12:00,792,"WATER CLEARED UP ALREADY? HM M M M  M  .   .   .     ONLY ONE TRIB I KNOW CLEARS THAT FAST!! NOT SURE WHERE TO GO . . . .    ANY PLACE WITH RELATIVELY EASY ACCESS WILL BE PACKED! I MIGHT TRY MY LUCK ALONG A 'NO STOPPING' ZONE . . . .    ONLY ONE SPOT YOU CAN GET FAR ENOUGH OFF THE ROADWAY THAT YOU MIGHT NOT GET A $60.00 TAG . . . .     BUT EVEN THIS SPOT MIGHT BE LESS THAN 33' FROM THE CENTER LINE? ALL IT TAKES IS A FEW PARKING PARTIALLY ON THE PAVEMENT, AND AN IRATE CITIZEN CALLING IN . . . .     EVERYBODY GETS TAGGED, AND IF THE COPPERS ARE IN A BAD MOOD . . . .   TOWED! I JUST HOPE IT ISN'T QUITE COLD ENOUGH TO ICE MY LINE UP . . . .    ALL I WANT IS A COUPLE FOR MY TABLE WHILE I WAIT FOR THE OL' CARP TO WAKE UP!"
