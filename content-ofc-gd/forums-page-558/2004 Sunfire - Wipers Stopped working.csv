565850,BillM,2011-03-25 15:03:00,17367, In your case it was the linkage that was seized.  Common problem on the later year VW's.  I've taken mine apart a few times and greased them.  Added zerks the last time
565859,Stoty,2011-03-25 15:21:00,2910,"I just took another look, and I CAN hear the motor running, so I'm betting it's the linkage. I'm gonna tear some pieces off to see if I can get it figured out... mind you, I know NOTHING about cars! Glad it's HER car!!! LOL"
565861,Headhunter,2011-03-25 15:26:00,5703,"Remove the wiper blades, place gently in a safe place... dispose of the car, you now have a perfectly good set of blades for when she buys her next bic. HH ***sorry, I simply can't help myself!!!***"
565864,Billy Bob,2011-03-25 15:32:00,5865,LOL...good one...  Stoty.....for now you can coat her windshield RainEx until repaired.
565866,Stoty,2011-03-25 15:34:00,2910,"Believe me.... I've been trying to get her to buy something new for a while now! She's a highschool teacher, so she can afford it... but as we all know... Teacher's are very ""thrifty"" (to keep things politically correct)."
565867,Stoty,2011-03-25 15:35:00,2910, Only problem with that is the bottle of RainEx is worth more than the car....

566123,ketchenany,2011-03-26 14:08:00,3229, There you go taking things apart and greasing it!
566315,pikehunter,2011-03-27 00:21:00,1659, Guess you could say that if 40 grand sounds like a cheap car to you. A demo at the Ford dealer in Burlington was 38 g's a couple of months ago. To me that isn't cheap.

566496,skeeter,2011-03-27 15:39:00,1907,"I had the same problem with the wife's van on Friday. When i took the plastic cap off the top of the motor there is a torx head screw there, holding the linkage down to the top of the motor. I went to undo that screw and found it slightly loose, like a 1/4 turn loose. Tightened it up and the wipers worked, but the linkage on the top of the motor had moved so i just had to re align it."
566778,fishinguypat,2011-03-28 05:33:00,547, LOL
565554,Stoty,2011-03-24 18:38:00,2910,"My girlfriend has a 2004 Sunfire, and her wipers just literally stopped working, mid-sweep. I checked the fuse, and checked to see if something got lodged, preventing the wipers from going.  Any ideas as to what might be causing this?  Also, not sure if this is normal or not, but while the car is off, I am able to literally move the wipers manually.  Any help is much appreciated!"
565555,BillM,2011-03-24 18:40:00,17367,Wiper relay or the wiper motor itself.
565557,irishfield,2011-03-24 18:43:00,26272,"  Did you do that before or after they stopped working..  Wiper ""park"" switch is stuck open and the motor thinks they're home.  It can also be the multi switch on the signal light actuator if her car has one. My '98 GMC was $560+ for that dang thing + labour."
565569,ecmilley,2011-03-24 19:09:00,2163,"if you can move the arms without much resistence chances are the wiper transmission is broken, this isn't uncommon, also the motor may have burned out or lost its ground all are common issues"
565571,cuzza,2011-03-24 19:10:00,467,"If you can move them by hand, I'd be checking the linkage between the motor and the wipers, I'm not familiar with the Sunfire but alot of them are ball and socket or shaft and circlip type arrangements and you may just be able to pop it back together."
565574,Fisherman,2011-03-24 19:22:00,7201,"Jeez it's only a Sunfire and a girlfriend, take out the windshield, give her a helmet and goggles, she'll be the cool one on the road.  Might also be the small circuit board that the trucks had issues with."
565583,Stoty,2011-03-24 19:53:00,2910,"Wow, thanks guys!  I moved them AFTER try stopped working, LOL"
565588,bdox,2011-03-24 20:04:00,329,You should get her to activate them and see if you can hear the motor making any kind of noise. that should narrow it down to a couple options.
565600,pidge,2011-03-24 20:32:00,438,"Can you hear the motor working??? If so I'd check what ""Cuzza"" has said. Pop the hood and start looking around the winshield area for screws that hold the cowl. The hood may have to be lowered again to fully remove the cowl, but once its removed you'll get acess to the linkages. Like Cuzzy said it may just need to be poped back on. My old truck did this a few times and I finally had to replace the linkage. Cheap part, cheaper if you can do it yourself. Good luck."
565610,fishcrisp,2011-03-24 20:46:00,17,turn the wipers to the on psoition.. take a hammer and hit the wiper motor.. i bet u it will start working again. I had a truck back in the day and from time to time thats what i had to do
565617,Billy Bob,2011-03-24 21:16:00,5865,"Just tell her to drive it on SUNNY DAYS....like a motorcycle...LOL  Consider yourself luck if that's all it is for NOW....my son had a 2002 Sunfire and the head gasket went and the fuel pump was going...(had given him problems before)....one repair shop where he went to college offered him $1000.00 for it...LOL.......  Good Luck, you're going to need it in the future...  Edited to add: Try what FishCrip said...  Bob"
565628,Pikeslayer,2011-03-24 21:47:00,1443,I think the car is broken. You may want get a new girlfriend.  Slayer
565631,dhickey,2011-03-24 22:00:00,1038,my jetta did that about a month ago. i could hear the wipper moter. no movement with the wipers. there are several linkages in there . it only takes one of the main ones close to the wiper moter to wear out . my mechanic got the right part from the auto wrecker ant the whole deal only cost 90 bucks. and no agrivation.

565655,pics,2011-03-25 00:39:00,1268,"This happened to our old cavalier. Try to find the ground wire from the motor then check where it is grounded to the firewall. Unscrew it , sand the metal parts that are rusty, then put it back together. If that doesn't work, well....... If it has one of those circuit boards,(I doubt it does) they can be fixed as well. Remove the board and use a dollar store magnifying glass to find small cracks in the solder. Get a small soldering gun and re-melt the affected areas. The full size chev trucks had these and many people were stuck buying new parts when they could be fixed in 10 minutes.........."
565658,Daplumma,2011-03-25 00:47:00,1961,  Ditto.The old Astro vans had this issue.If the linkage moves freely It may be a toasted linkage.Either way a new girlfriend is in order. Joe
565757,Tarzan's Jane,2011-03-25 10:32:00,1183,"And if you don't get it fixed for her ASAP...then a new boyfriend is in order.   (Just sticking it back to the ones that suggested a new girlfriend)   Seriously though, this is a test to see just how handy you are.  If you really want to keep her you got until tomorrow to get r done."
565758,Fisherman,2011-03-25 10:56:00,7201," Why would he get it fixed for his girlfriend, her car, her problem.  Besides, being a good girlfriend leads to being a good future wife and we all know that means spending time in the kitchen away from the phone and computer.  Time away from the stove leads to potential burning of supper, a.k.a. unhappy husband syndrome.   Now get back to your stove and no texting between stirring."
565804,bigbuck,2011-03-25 13:26:00,2449,"It's either the motor or the dreaded multi function switch. Get a circuit tester and see if there is any current to the wiper motor itself, try different positions on the switch. If you are real handy, you can replace the motor, the switch is a different matter, the steering wheel needs to come off along with the airbag so that's better left for a qualified shop to handle. Try rockauto.com for the parts, they ship to Canada and are much cheaper than anywhere here. I have a shipment of parts coming in today and including shipping and taxes, I'm saving 30-40% over what the shop price is nevermind what Canadian Tire or Partsource or any of the other parts stores would charge for them. The only issue is that it takes about a week to get the parts."
565818,pikehunter,2011-03-25 14:10:00,1659,"Problem's not the car or the wiper motor...problem is you need to dump her and find a mechanically inclined girl so she can fix her own car, then when you have a problem with yours then she can fix it too!  Oh yeah, make sure she likes fishing and if she has a boat even better!"
