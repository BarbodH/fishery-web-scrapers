566721,danbouck,2011-03-28 01:24:00,4380,"Agree, I usually hate the juno's but this year it has been great."
566727,muskymike,2011-03-28 01:33:00,772," I was thinking the same thing Dan. Usually dont even bother, but I have watched the entire thing so far this year. Odd. I didn't even know some of these artists were Canadian."
566732,Rod Caster,2011-03-28 01:43:00,5784,I forgot the juno's were on...I actually wanted to check it out. Canadian music is better than ever imo. Arcade Fire in particular are an incredible band.
566737,danc,2011-03-28 01:55:00,4677,"Know why they're called the Junos? Cuz when someboby wins an award, you simply elbow the guy sitting next to you and say ""Hey. Juno who that guy is""?"

566792,SlowPoke,2011-03-28 11:47:00,2984,"""Holy ^%$#, this doesn't look Canadian"" is what I said when Drake took the stage. ""Never before have the Juno's left me wanting more"" is what I said when the credits rolled.  I will admit that throughout the show there was quite a few ""Who's that?"" comments but fortunately I was watching the show with a couple musicians that knew many of the artists personally or knew people that played with them.  I probably wouldn't have watched the show this year but a friend of mine was nominated. Sadly, he wasn't chosen for Blues Album of the Year. (The Johnny Max Band - It's a long Road)  It was a great show for me and an even greater experience for my friend Wayne. He enjoyed a week of Juno festivities, met a few icons in the industry and is looking forward to going back! He said a lot has changed since his last nomination ten years ago."
