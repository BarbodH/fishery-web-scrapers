Never ran ever before. Would, I have problems with this outboard and if so what should I be looking for?? I am worried about the gaskets being brittle and maybe have some corrosion around the pistons. Or maybe, I will be surprised and she would run just as new. Thanks ."
566449,SRT8 smoker craft,2011-03-27 14:00:00,1107,They ship with a oil to prevent corrosion but I don't know how long that would last   I would take it to get looked at before handing over the $$$ might cost a few bucks but it's better than having a brand new 140hp anchor
566456,Billy Bob,2011-03-27 14:08:00,5865,I would be interested in WHY there is a 19 year old motor still in it's crate.......something sounds FISHY here...
566462,skeeter,2011-03-27 14:15:00,1907,Is it a private sale or from a dealer? If its from a dealer then they should have no problem with a warranty.
566513,FishOn,2011-03-27 16:43:00,136,"I don't know where they got these outboards. I saw the advertisement and in the pictures it looks as if the unit was a marina that had closed and left the engines behind. They have the two engines in a crate and all controls for them. Who knows!! I am going to get the engine checked before I give them the money. $4,500 for one is the asking price."
566514,FishOn,2011-03-27 16:46:00,136,Here are some pictures of the outboards.

566598,Bernie,2011-03-27 20:00:00,3190,This one looks like it would be a lot more fun. Might be a dollar or two more though.  http://www.seven-marine.com/
566790,Billy Bob,2011-03-28 11:45:00,5865, As long as they troll down I say get one......
566799,skeeter,2011-03-28 12:08:00,1907,"Hey Bernie, do they come in a tiller version??"
