She's not even getting 80 votes a day (and I know over 25 of those are coming from family). Guess I should have said she was trying to build a shelter...

564366,dhickey,2011-03-22 02:09:00,1038,would you lend your support? it would be for sick kids hospital .. when your daughter feels better in the fall she can do the  presentation?(if she wants to?)  this is just a thought. something i would be willing to persue. /i owe a great deal to sick kids.  looking for grass root support.  salty i hope this helps you to understand ps   i have one that she can have./brand new. pm me
564376,The Urban Fisherman,2011-03-22 02:37:00,2050,done and shall continue to do so. Good Luck!
564380,irishfield,2011-03-22 02:43:00,26272,  Like I said Salty... it's something that needs it's own thread and see where the members take it. Anything to make a better stay in the hospital for kids is no doubt a great idea. You'll probably need clearance from sick kids to make a donation of such devices though. So check into that and then spark up a new thread to see if it can be done. I've been waiting 3 months to find out if I can buy a $100 microwave for the 11th floor pantry of Mount Sinai to no avail.. yet I know someone put a $50 one from Walmart in the nurses station ..instead of the pantry where they blew it up!
