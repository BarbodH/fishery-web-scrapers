562922,hawk-eye,2011-03-18 04:30:00,141,"Similar problem here, just havnt made the phone call yet. A friend of myne bought his licence last June (this is the first time for him) still have not recived the card. Now he wants to renew but where to you put the sticker?  Hes gonna make the call soon and by the sounds of it I should record the conversation."
562924,BillM,2011-03-18 04:47:00,17367,"Did my renewal by phone, got the card in 3 weeks."
562934,Twocoda,2011-03-18 11:12:00,4130,did mine through snail mail and received it 3 weeks later...  years ago i didnt receive my card before they went on strike ...so i bought another license through CT to have something to produce and actually got charged for having two licenses...they dropped the charge but didnt refund my money for the second license
563096,LeXXington,2011-03-18 19:16:00,1928,"LOL, that was the best,,,"
563103,aplumma,2011-03-18 19:32:00,6896,I presented a check made to ART MELANCON at my bank the new teller did not know me so she asked for my License to confirm the name. She said she could not cash it because it was made out to ART and my license said ARTHUR. She had been instructed to not cash checks made out to nick names. Sigh.....We had a discussion about the difference between nicknames and first names. It took the teller next to her to pull her aside and assure her it was O.K. to cash mt check. It is a good thing she did not see my Driving Record it has an alias on it McLancon due to a bad E somewhere in the records. Got to love the system.   Art

563251,dhickey,2011-03-19 01:27:00,1038,checked again today. still not here?  what do i do with this????
563279,vinnimon,2011-03-19 02:20:00,2593,I called the 1 800 # today and asked if mine has been sent out. She only asked for the licence # and NO the card wasnt issued yet. Because I purchased it at a local bait shop. She assured me that within a month they will receive it and issue it. They are dealing with the direct purchases so far. She was very Kind and quick to respond with all my questions Know to call the MNR as see if my licence# is registered to my name for 2011
563298,Handlebarz,2011-03-19 03:33:00,3790,Well thanks to this thread I have now started my waiting process I wonder if Mike Parker can get it before who ever  Obanion or O'Banion or what ever they last came up with LOL. Heck I dont think I will need mine before you Rick but I do think they will get me hooked up first.

563321,bubbles,2011-03-19 12:09:00,591,"Online is the only way to go, print out the temp card and you are all set."

563330,spincast,2011-03-19 13:14:00,3279,"Wow, not surprising but disappointing - you're just lucky the supervisor hadn't been promoted yet, cause then the person you spoke with will no doubt gets his job for following the protocols so well. A perfect example of bureaucratic training.  I can't imagine what would happen to Hubert if I had to call and ask; probably fry what few circuits he has - I go by my second name; and a contraction at that - Rick instead of Richard. My given name is a Welsh one, and man does that cause some confusion with North American pronounciation..  My drivers license is completely different than my outdoors card.  "
563332,Billy Bob,2011-03-19 13:25:00,5865, Sounds like if caught you will be on the deportation list...
563405,Oggie,2011-03-19 18:22:00,588,"Well that explains why I had trouble renewing on line. My last name has a ""'"" in it!  It's a conspiracy against the Irish I tell you!  I think the first request I'll make when I call will be, "" Can I speak to your supervisor please?"".     That ought'a cut the time for renewal in half.  Funny story Rick.... uh Richard....uh Dick!  Dan O."
563411,Billy Bob,2011-03-19 18:40:00,5865, Yep......we've been slowly working on that for about 200 year now...and only now are we seeing the results....
563505,spincast,2011-03-19 23:53:00,3279,  You could be right - any good fishing spots down your way?
563632,Billy Bob,2011-03-20 10:09:00,5865, I think we are only accepting Mexicans at the present time...

567249,bigfish1965,2011-03-29 15:55:00,3382,I received my card today...my name has NO apostrophe..lol. Sigh...

567252,irishfield,2011-03-29 16:04:00,26272,"LOL Rick.. what were our ancestors thinking when they did that damn ""son of"" apostrophe...  Hopefully your never there, nor have to put up with it.. but Jen's a daily nightmare. Scans in TGeneral her name has the apostrophe.. Sinai has her with NO apostrophe.. OHIP card has one. They misplace her files/scans on a per visit bases because of that darn ""tick""."
567294,Fish4Eyes,2011-03-29 18:58:00,1022,Who cares if you got the card or not if you have the temporary one which should have the correct spelling of your name as you are the one that fills it out? As long as you pay thats all that matters to them in the end
562692,bigfish1965,2011-03-17 15:45:00,3382,"Me: Hi, I paid for a new outdoors card last year but never received it. MNR: Can I have your name please. Me; Sure, it is Rick O'Banion MNR: I am sorry but we don't have a Rick O'Banion on file here. Have you ever purchased a license before? Me: Uh...yeah. Lots of them MNR: We have a Richard O'Banion, but no Rick Me: ..... Really? MNR: Yes sir, that is what the file says. Me: But that is me... MNR: Didn't you say your name was Rick? Me: It is. MNR: so are you Rick or Richard? Me: Really??? MNR: I just need to know your name. Me: It is both... MNR: Both? Me: Yes..Rick and Richard are the same thing... MNR: Not according to this sir. Me: Seriously? Rick is a short version for Richard. MNR: Well we have a Richard on file....but no Rick. Me: (Seeing I am getting no where) I am Richard. MNR: Oh, I thought you said Rick earlier... ME: No...that's probably just my bad cell connection. MNR: Ok, I can see we need to update your file, thats why the card wasn't mailed. Sir, we have your name spelled two different ways..one with an apostrophe, one without. Me: Yes, that is because your computers would not accept special characters in names back when the card first came out. MNR: special characters? Me: Apostrophes...your computers could not use apostrophes in names before. MNR: So is it spelled with an apostrophe? Me: I don't really care... MNR: What is it on your drivers license? Me: With an apostrophe.. MNR: Well it has to be the same. ME: OK, so can you change it? MNR: I don't really know., sir. ME: You know, how about I just go buy a new one and save this aggravation. MNR: No sir, having two cards is an offense. Me: But I don't have one now..so how can I be in violation? MNR: Well, I think you do have one..its just in someone elses name. Me: You mean Rick OBanion MNR: Yes. Me: I hate that guy. MNR: Pause... Ok sir, I am going to put you through to my supervisor. Me: Sigh...sure. MNR Supervisor: Hi, Rick. ME: Hi..look this is pretty simple actually MNR Supervisor: No sweat Rick, I see the problem and I have fixed it. Me: Really...cause it seemed like and issue for awhile MNR Supervisor: No, I just think that some people can't...well, it is taken care of, it will be in the mail today. You will need a new sticker though. Me: Yeah..thats good, thanks! MNR Supervisor: Anything else I can do for you? Me: No..thats about all I can take for one day...Ciao."

562695,Guest gbfisher,2011-03-17 16:13:00,0,Hey Rick....lol I guess nobody told you that the MNR was put in place to make it almost impossible for an average person to fish.

562698,dhickey,2011-03-17 16:21:00,1038,same thing is happening to me! cant get any where with them? getting a little ticked off with them i have had to buy 3 in the past 7 months so i could at least show current paper work showing that im legaly fishing. 1st time there was no record of me purchasing my renewall. 2nd time my address was wrong. when he read it back to me it was the sme as it had been for the past 10 years?  he also said that it had been sent back /returne to sender? that was back in january before going to nosbonsing. this forced me to buy a third time. still havent recieved it. whats up with that????  frustrated/ getting there!!!
562699,Harrison,2011-03-17 16:23:00,2202,"Wow, that's crazy Dick, I never knew you were Italian, Ciao"
562704,Nipfisher,2011-03-17 16:38:00,2449,"Ricky, I didn't know you spelled your name with an apostrophe. Like this Obannio'n?"
562706,Michael_Brown,2011-03-17 16:46:00,411,"What are the odds the card shows up for'Dick Obanion.  Next season you will need several licenses, could get expensive.  Richard, Rick, Dick, Rich if you get the three year regular license for everyone should be around $1000.00"

562751,Dara,2011-03-17 19:20:00,3052,"Why do you keep changing your name?   When you get the cards you will be able to take what, 3 or 4 limits per day...just stick one card on each pile and tell the CO you are watching the fish for the other guys"

562773,Dara,2011-03-17 20:23:00,3052,"I was heading out fishing and stopped to buy my license. I wanted a combo with 3 years fish and 3 years hunting. They said they couldn't sell that to me. I don't want to mess with buying them every year and taking a chance on forgetting so I said skip it. I'll fish without it this weekend and buy it online next week. Came to me within geez...I think 2 weeks, so things worked out ok"

I called in, did some paper work they requested I complete, and sent the card back. 6wks later, I get an envelope in the mail, I open it and it's a new card with the same spelling mistake...Go figure"
562786,GBW,2011-03-17 21:39:00,8460,now that was funny I guess the summer students have already started...
562787,irishfield,2011-03-17 21:45:00,26272,Summer students.. don't give them that!  The apostrophe has been a long standing issue. We can't renew on line as their server crashes your application with a sytax error.
562851,camillj,2011-03-17 23:31:00,1988,I always do it online and print my own temp one till the other arrives ...
