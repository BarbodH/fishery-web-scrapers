The Credit river needs Anglers help and support to keep this good fishing going. This Saturday is a presentation and discussion to help the credit river gain National Heritage River status. Achieving this status would benefit all anglers who visit this awesome river. So far anglers support is low, we have a lot to gain by showing our support. Hope to see you there.  Admission is free and lunch is included.  What more could you ask for.

This is from an email I received from Dave Beaton, our Community Stewardship Specialist.   CVC is working with a number of community groups that have been interested in having the Credit recognized as a National Heritage River…   This is pretty exciting as it would recognize the value of the Credit and could have fantastic spinoff benfits to the community.    CVC is hosting a meeting this Saturday April 2nd with support from the Mississauga’s of the New Credit and the Credit River Heritage Society.  It is vital that we have a broad cross section of the community represented from the beginning of this process.  I’d ask that you come and that you pass on the invite to others that you know that see the Credit as special and worth celebrating.    I don’t make claims like this often but I can assure you that it will be well worth your time.  If this is the first you’re  hearing about this, I apologize for the short notice.  We’ve had some issues with compiling our lists which has led to some oversights.  I hope to see you on Saturday.
