566738,skinny,2011-03-28 01:58:00,442,I have been thinking of picking up a BPS microlite rod to use for perch fishing I have wanted something a bit more sensitive than my other rods
566788,danbouck,2011-03-28 11:28:00,4380,I bought one a while back for that reason and don't like it. IMO it is too sensitive. It's now one of the kids rods.
566791,skeeter,2011-03-28 11:46:00,1907,"Too sensitive???? I love my ultra and micro lites. Combined with a 2-6 LB braid. If a fish even licks the bait you can feel it. If a walleye hits , it's pure fun ! Just make sure you have the drag set properly."
566794,rbaquial,2011-03-28 11:52:00,968,"I like them. I got the 7'6"" version. I use it for Panfish also. My only issue with it is that the tip is a little fragile. I think I've gone through 2 now?  1st one broke just cause I wasn't paying attention to what I was doing. 2nd time, broke because I leaned it up against a tree.. when I went to grab it, it somehow got wedged and busted the tip.  I'm now looking into getting the Daiwa Spinmatic-C Ultra-Light Series. Its roughly in the same price range I believe.  http://lebaron.ca/pdf_files_sp11/daiwa_procaster.pdf"

566820,OhioFisherman,2011-03-28 13:25:00,6623,"I bought an ultra light rod, 20-30 years ago, it quickly became my rod to catch bait with!"
567024,alexmedic,2011-03-28 23:55:00,186,"I bought a 7'0 Micro Lite a few years ago.  I got a small jig caught in some weeds and yanked it up to break free and crack!  The rod broke at the fist taper in the rod, just past the cork handle.  I then watched 6 1/2 feet of it slide down the line into 30 feet of water, never to be seen again!  Took the little piece of rod I had left (and receipt) back to BPS the next week and got a new one - no questions asked!  That break must have been a weak spot.  Since then, I have never had any issues with the rod.  I think they are great.."
