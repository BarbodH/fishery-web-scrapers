566645,cheaptackle,2011-03-27 21:55:00,849,Just got home and saw a guy dragging his sled out front (really!) - want me to run out and see if he can use them? Dying to know what happened to your day....  Michael
566650,dhickey,2011-03-27 22:04:00,1038,know how ya feel   better luck next time.
566670,Rod Caster,2011-03-27 22:58:00,5784,"  Get your binoculars on him! If he is catching fish, we should try that exact same spot next time haha.  Perfectly good minnows for all you spec/splake fishermen in the Bay area."
566690,Rizzo,2011-03-28 00:12:00,4754,"Nuts, the wife just told me I'm not allowed to drive 5 hours round trip for $3.00 worth of minnows...the woman just doesn't understand a good deal"
566694,Rod Caster,2011-03-28 00:23:00,5784,I can ship them out with a fragile sticker. its around 30 for shipping but the minnows are FREE!
566699,danbouck,2011-03-28 00:29:00,4380,I can pick them up in June.
566705,HTHM,2011-03-28 00:53:00,4082,Throw 'em in salt and freeze em
566713,Nipfisher,2011-03-28 01:14:00,2449,Fry 'em up and enjoy.
566730,Rod Caster,2011-03-28 01:41:00,5784,  I'll wait for smelt season before I eat minnows.     Probably that's what I'll do if I can't give 'em away. I have a fresh bag of pickling salt in the cupboard....
566789,Billy Bob,2011-03-28 11:35:00,5865,Dry good....salt and refrigerate ....freezing makes them mushy...they keep a LONG time.
