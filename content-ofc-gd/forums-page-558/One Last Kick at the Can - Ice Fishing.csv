566301,Leecher,2011-03-26 23:44:00,7832,"Ice fishing season is coming to an end up here (March 31st) and today Whitespinnerbait and I planned to target one of our local lake one last time for whities  When I woke up this morning, temps was -9C, clear skies with a slight westerly at around 7KM/H..... well that was all we needed to know and head out.   Upon arriving at destination, the winds had double in strength and stayed present throughout our stay    Suffice to say, we all got wind burned but was a real good time out there  Not 5 minutes after setting up my jigging rod with a MR. Champ tipped with a white fish fry, I got a small hit..... jigged a couple of times and got another   continued jigging and then WHAM!!! FISH ON!!!! The fight was not long since I was in about 25 fow but this fish gave some big head shakes   I really thought it was a laker but to my surprise this beauty whitie made it's way up the hole    I didn't take any other pics cause that was the only fish I landed today    but still it was great to be out with friends  Paul got to land a few OOS lakers which made it's way back ASAP!!! Not sure if he has any other pics but want to say thank you Paul for a great time Now time to go bowling ""rock & bowl"" style to raise funds for my daugther's YBC National tournament Hope you enjoy!!! Leechman  ***** Update *****  Here's a couple of pics of the beaut and me that a friend took with his blackberry:    "
566306,Rod Caster,2011-03-26 23:57:00,5784,yeah! go team 8.  Nice fish ... way to get one more outing
566320,bigugli,2011-03-27 00:29:00,6138,"Good job Jacques.  We had started open water season here, but everything has iced back up the past 2 nights."
566321,GBW,2011-03-27 00:34:00,8460,I tried to get a panfish upgrade for Team 8 today to find there was no safe way on the ice where we wanted to go (unless you laid a 20' ladder down from shore to ice).  It's a NICE fish Jacques for sure!
566323,Pikeslayer,2011-03-27 00:39:00,1443,"Thank you for risking your life for team 8 jacques  Slayer,"
566331,Slop,2011-03-27 01:17:00,151,Nice job Leechman!  Did you see any trucks or Sunfires out on the ice today?
566377,Cudz,2011-03-27 03:46:00,2652,nice fish.
566409,TroutnMuskieHunter,2011-03-27 12:39:00,1362," Good good job Jacques....  Hey Grant....not only did he see a Sunfire, he was in one"
566411,Leecher,2011-03-27 12:40:00,7832," Thanks Chad!!!   Thanks Bruce!!!  The Ottawa and Gatineau rivers are wide open but the lakes have a good 20""+ of solid black ice on them   Were back in the deep freeze now today -17C with windchill   Thanks Geoff!!!  Better be safe than sorry.... I guess you guys will have open water sooner than us.... Trout opener is just around the corner and I'm sure we'll have iceberg's floating for opening day   Thanks Simon!!!  I wasn't in any danger since I was standing on 20""+ of black ice but the rumbling sure happen frequently yesterday   Thanks Slop!!!  We saw 5 or 6 trucks go by yesterday.... and the Sunfire was part of the contigent.... Were you in one of them trucks???   Thanks Chris!!!"

566431,cram,2011-03-27 13:23:00,1733,Really nice fish.  I have never caught a whitey .   How do they taste relative to a lake trout?
566437,Leecher,2011-03-27 13:37:00,7832," Thanks Terry!!!   We certainly did.... Thanks Frankie!!!   Thanks Kevin!!!  No not yet.... after this long wonderful day, had to prep it (filet it) and then get ready for bowling.  I still have to remove the middle bones and then it's good to go in the pan   Thanks cram!!! I never eat lake trout so I can't give you a comparison but whities taste relatively close to walleyes, only better"
566748,ehg,2011-03-28 02:31:00,2666,Nice fish Jacques That one fish probably made your day.
