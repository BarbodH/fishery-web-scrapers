But I cannot, for the life of me, find out how to list the threads I've subscribed to.  It doesn't seem to appear under my profile or my private messages, nor anywhere else I've looked.  I'm sure its bloody obvious, but can someone please help...  Bryan"
566857,irishfield,2011-03-28 16:19:00,26272,I believe all that subscribing does.. is it sends you an email everytime someone responds to that thread. At least that's what it's for on an airplane forum I belong to.
566866,Garry2Rs,2011-03-28 16:50:00,1425,"I'm sure that you know that if you want to save something, you can high-light it by holding the left mouse button down as you scroll over it. Then Copy be pressing Ctrl and ""C"" at the same time. Now you can e-mail it to yourself, or put it into word pad etc. To Paste it into the form press Ctrl ""V"""

Many users find this useful to keep up to date on topics without the need to view the board to check for new messages.  There are three ways to subscribe to a topic: Please note that there are four different types of subscriptions:  Immediate Email Notification This option will send out a notification immediately after a new topic or reply has been made regardless of your activity.  Delayed Emailed Notification This option will send out a notification if a new topic or reply has been made and you're not active on the board.  Daily Email Digest This option will send out a daily digest showing all new replies or topics for that day.  Weekly Email Digest This option will send out a weekly digest showing all new replies or topics for that week.   You are also able to subscribe to each individual forum on the board, to be notified when a new topic is created in that particular forum. To enable this, click 'Forum Options' menu at the top forum you wish to subscribe to, and click the 'Subscribe to this forum' link.  To unsubscribe from any forums or topics that you are subscribed to - just go to the 'Subscriptions' section of 'My Controls' and you can do this from there."
566881,Warthaug,2011-03-28 17:24:00,30,"Its nice to know I wasn't missing anything obvious.  Many of the other forums I frequent maintain a list of the threads you've subscribed to in your profile.  I've always used that to keep track of threads I want to come back to.  I didn't realise that subscribing here was simply e-mail notifications...  Unfortunately, some of the threads I ""bookmarked"" via subscribing are unlikely to be replied to, as they're rather old.  Guess my on-computer bookmark folders going to get a little bigger...  Thanx for the replies everyone  B"
