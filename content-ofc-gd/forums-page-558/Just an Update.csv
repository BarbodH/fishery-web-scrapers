566816,BITEME,2011-03-28 13:16:00,1968,Well it is over my first stand up in front of everyone my legs were shaking so i jabbed myself in the rear with a push pin and got on with the grunt next one was better and the last one was great. Now I can pass my bad habits on to those that wish to know. I learned a lot it was a good crew and the whole thing was very enjoyable.  Onward and Upward  Peter
