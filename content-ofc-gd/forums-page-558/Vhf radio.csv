566932,walleyejack,2011-03-28 19:47:00,358,"Am looking to buy a vhf radio to keep an eye on lake O and updates,I am looking for any input or advice on the purchase of any particular unit,I see lots of different brands out there for $99.I am thinking they are just as good as anything,appreciate any input"
566953,DRIFTER_016,2011-03-28 21:01:00,10439,  I have an Icom IC-M304. Great little radio and will integrate with an onboard GPS to broadcast your location during an emergency. Keep in mind that the cheper models don't have this feature. One of the main reaons I purchased this model was it's tiny size. I wanted to flush mount it in my console to keep the area neat and tidy.  Icom IC-M304  A couple of shots with it mounted in the boat to get an idea of it's size.  Front   Back   Mounted in the boat 
566959,Fisherman,2011-03-28 21:33:00,7201,"VHF radios along with other types must pass an industry standard to be allowed to be licenced.  Most all brands fall well within, some slightly better.   Some have more ""features"" but that doesn't make them a technically better radio.  For the few dollars more I would pay the extra for DSC.  That's automatic GPS transmission when your butts drinking lakewater and the SS Minnow is sinking."
566967,walleyejack,2011-03-28 21:56:00,358," nice job there for sure,I have been looking at a couple of those modles and the Lowrance LVR250 all the ones i looked at had 25 w min, and dsc thanks"
566995,LeXXington,2011-03-28 22:48:00,1928,"One feature I had with my old radio that I really miss with my new one was the ability to scan preset channels.  For example I would program 16,68,72 and it would just scan all these so I could hear friends calling me.  My new one only scan's 16 and one other preset.  It also has a feature to scan all channels but in the Toronto you pic up everything and this feature is a waste of time.  My 2 cents"
567048,vinnimon,2011-03-29 00:28:00,2593,I purchased a  hummingbird handheld radio a while back. Its been very useful for me. And for a few others.
567058,BITEME,2011-03-29 00:39:00,1968,"For the course call your local power boat squadron or call The Coast Guard Station  Whatever radio you buy, you would be wise to have a DSC radio and register the MMSI number(Maritime Mobile Service Identity)  http://www.ccg-gcc.g...g/CCG/MCTS_Mmsi  Like lew said you need to do a course. The radio I use and it stays attached to me at all times on the water is a Standard Horizon HX850S it floats is water proof has excellent range a GPS and DSC. I also have a Standard Horizon fixed unit in the boat that i have tied to the chartplotter with the same capabilities (this is good assuming I dont fall out of the boat or lose power)hand held backup I fish alone quite a bit  MMSI and DSC in a nut shell if you hit the panic button the GPS will lock your position and send an emergency alert this will be packaged with your Lat and Long and MMSI# which has some very specific information about you your boat emergency contacts and and most important your position.YOU ARE A VERY SMALL SPEC ON A LARGE BODY OF WATER worse when its rough an exact point in the water is very usful to others if needed. Is this a smart choice I truly believe it is the service is in place its free and TIME COUNTS  Sorry I posted this before it was long I can't edit it but you get the idea Peter  Good luck"
567106,walleyejack,2011-03-29 01:44:00,358," thanks Peter, usefull info for sure"
567130,Dara,2011-03-29 02:30:00,3052,A decent antenae will cost more than the radio
567162,camillj,2011-03-29 04:12:00,1988,And the Antenna is what determines your range (xmit and receive)
567213,walleyejack,2011-03-29 13:16:00,358,"Any suggestions on a good antenna ? I have a fiberglass 5ft,but I am sure that won't cut it.Or just go to my local marine radio/gps guy in town here?"
567227,Fisherman,2011-03-29 14:16:00,7201,"8 foot fibreglass, go see the guys at Durham Radio, they're in Whitby."
