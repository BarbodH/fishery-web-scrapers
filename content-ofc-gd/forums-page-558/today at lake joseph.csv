Saw few people fishin, few ATV's and snowmobile. Anyway I fished for about 4hrs today and got few hits and lost 2 while reeling in...

566852,moose,2011-03-28 15:51:00,266,What part of lake were you fishing we only saw two groups out there
566862,beginner,2011-03-28 16:47:00,542,I was at the middle of playfair island and birch island... It was sunday when I went... only few people I saw... it feels like nobody do ice fish that lake... lol  lucky for us lol
566868,moose,2011-03-28 16:56:00,266,It can be busy on saturdays We saw three groups wear we were We got on at Gordon bay marine
566876,beginner,2011-03-28 17:11:00,542,I checked gordon bay but I dont know where to park so I came back to the same place where I went last yr... Not far from where you are... you planing to go back this weekend?? you think still good??
566896,johnnyb,2011-03-28 18:11:00,3413,"If you were between Playfair and Birch Islands, my guess is that you were parking at the CNIB camp....just wondering if you have been there a lot this year?  I've heard of people's cars getting ticketed/towed from there the last couple of years, and have been reluctant to park there myself."
566936,beginner,2011-03-28 19:54:00,542,"  last year I went there twice and this year only once... I didnt know that they ticket/towed car there, saw some cars last yr so I park there, then again this sunday.. well good to the hear news.. I would be very careful next time... I heard Gordon bay marine charge 10d for parking..."
566942,moose,2011-03-28 20:24:00,266,Ten dollars to park is alot cheaper than calling a taxi to go to pound and pay for car to be let go plus ticket
566943,moose,2011-03-28 20:25:00,266,Depending on weather we might go back up saturday
566955,beginner,2011-03-28 21:01:00,542,planning to go back sunday... I hope it gets colder...  sorry guys.. I love soft water too but I kindly enjoy ice this yr... lol
567065,Skud,2011-03-29 00:52:00,739,"I was also out there yesterday in Foot's Bay. My buddy landed two and lost a couple and I got skunked. We fished from 2-7pm. Lots of chasers but light biters, hard to get a good hook set. Will be out next weekend. The ice will hold up for sure. I seen over a dozen trucks driving around out there still. 12 to 16 inches of ice. Lake Joe has been unkind to me this season. Need to have a good outing for closure."
