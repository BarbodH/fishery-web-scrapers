566058,alphaalpha,2011-03-26 02:32:00,475,sounds like fun.  If I get my new boat the weekend before I may come out for it
566424,mistaredone,2011-03-27 13:02:00,913,Do you need boat insurance to enter?
566483,SRT8 smoker craft,2011-03-27 15:15:00,1107, Rules are on their sites
566601,mistaredone,2011-03-27 20:17:00,913,  Thanks!  I read the rules on the first link YOU posted and it says nothing about insurance. I've never done a tournament but I thought most require a special type of insurance.
566604,fishdawg,2011-03-27 20:21:00,912, No different then any other day on the water. We wont be checking for insurance. Hoping to draw a good field for the event!
566606,mistaredone,2011-03-27 20:25:00,913,Thank you
566609,grt1,2011-03-27 20:29:00,638,"since there are no stupid questions , i'll ask  What the heck is straight line angling?"
566613,fishdawg,2011-03-27 20:32:00,912,"Strait Line Anglers  ""The most common question about the club is the name and it's spelling ""Strait"" rather then ""Straight"". It's simply a play-on-words. Strait is a name of a long, large size water-body, such as the Davis Strait. This is somewhat descriptive to the waters that our club members typically fish- Lake Ontario and Lake Erie."""
566704,SRT8 smoker craft,2011-03-28 00:53:00,1107," Thats all the info I had. I am not a member of the club, so all I can tell you is what is on their site.I have never been checked for insurance at a tourney"
