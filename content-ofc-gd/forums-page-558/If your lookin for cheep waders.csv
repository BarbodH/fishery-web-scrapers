566467,JohnF,2011-03-27 14:22:00,3494, I got my wife a pair at w'mart a year ago. The ones she got were identical to the green ones I bought a few years ago at CTC. I didn't like them at all. They were too tight in my butt making it tough to climb up riverbanks etc but for $30 they'd be great backups. If you're really skinny I guess they might be ok too.  HTHM borrowed them last year for a while. He might have some comment on them. I don't wear them at all now.  JF
