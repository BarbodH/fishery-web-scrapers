566621,darsky,2011-03-27 20:56:00,586,Life is like a trip to the butcher shop-you never know what you are gonna get.  http://au.todaytonight.yahoo.com/article/8989315/consumer/meat-glue
566627,misfish,2011-03-27 21:11:00,29133,WOW. Thats just crazy.  TFS.
566628,pikehunter,2011-03-27 21:12:00,1659,"Must be the stuff they use to glue together those breaded chicken cutlets that are made from chunks of meat and pressed into steak shape glob of meat and those weiner shnitchels that are chopped up pieces stuck together that some restaurants are trying to pass off as the real thing. Even had chicken balls in a chineses restaurant that were made from 1/4"" size chunks rolled up, battered and fried. Not very appealing."
566630,irishfield,2011-03-27 21:12:00,26272,What.. you never wondered how M & M's etc make every piece of meat fit their preformed packaging!!
566631,Spiel,2011-03-27 21:13:00,9065,An amazing waste of good glue....
566634,misfish,2011-03-27 21:21:00,29133," All I know is,salt beef is safe from that."
566636,Joey,2011-03-27 21:26:00,9122,Well isn't that lovely
566644,bigugli,2011-03-27 21:53:00,6138,"This practice, like many others, has been around for quite some time. Truth is most people don't know their cuts of meat so it becomes easier to get away with the mock cut. I know that most breaded meats are cut and paste product. It's the fancy cuts like wrapped filet mignon or london broils and ""boneless steaks"" that you have to watch. Just like people passing off mutton for lamb. The average consumer does not know any better"
566647,mercman,2011-03-27 21:58:00,7054,"Why !!!!!!!!!!!!!!Why do i read these things.........First Pangasius fish from Vietman, now crazy glue holding my steak together Whats left....."

567158,Pikeslayer,2011-03-29 03:49:00,1443, Hit the nail on the head there Wayne. Last time (a long time ago) I checked the filet mignon box from M&M's; 'Product of Australia'. That was the last time I ever bought again.  Slayer
567159,camillj,2011-03-29 03:53:00,1988,Wow .. thats scary ... especially for us 'med-rare' folks ... oh well ... now I guess you just gotta go for the MEGA Steaks ... with the fat still on and cut em up yourself
