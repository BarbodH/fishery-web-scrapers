Wind from the west and bone chilling cold. Washed my lures in the beautiful sun. Awesome.  Below falls - ice free. Sign says fish santuary until May 21. Locks still frozen.  There is a restaurant sitting right next to the falls. It will open April 1st. I will go back just to enjoy lunch by the falls.  SJ     original post:  Hi will be at Fenelon Falls, ON on Saturday all day. Wonder if it is possible to fish that area? Is there still ice? Open water? I know that below the falls (for 1km) is a fish santuary until May.  Anyone going out?  Thanks in advance."

Food quality isn't 5-star, but it's still good, and the selection is quite varied, Greek food, Italian, English/North American, basic burgers, I can't see anyone going here and not being able to find something they like. And the view is terrific!"
