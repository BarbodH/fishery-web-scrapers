567045,misfish,2011-03-29 00:26:00,29133,I see a new cast member for the remake of HR Pufnstuf .  Truely enjoyed Pete.
567054,Pete Maina,2011-03-29 00:32:00,213,"Great stuff. Gosh, I hadn't heard of HR in ages"
567278,Spiel,2011-03-29 17:32:00,9065," And sometimes (try as you may) you can't please anyone.....where's my prep ""H""....   Hope your'e trip is (was) a good'n Pete!"
567285,johnnyb,2011-03-29 18:11:00,3413,Great video!  Almost equal parts hilarious monologue and vicious rock-out session
567375,OhioFisherman,2011-03-29 23:16:00,6623,"LOL, I wish Bill Dance or KVD had competed in our local events... not! they were hard enough as is."
566181,NateFollmer,2011-03-26 17:25:00,19,Pete lays down the ultimate challenge to KVD and shares some advice on how to beat KVD once and for all! Listen up bass anglers because this may be your only chance to stop this monster. This is the first of many - 'The Maina Vent'!  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CvN6n1WZRzc
566186,HTHM,2011-03-26 17:43:00,4082,"Pete, you may want to have a chat with your video editor. The title screen at the end was a bit long....."
566196,adempsey,2011-03-26 18:24:00,1498,"That was kinda creepy actually, lol!"
566286,Garry2Rs,2011-03-26 23:09:00,1425,I liked the song...
566287,solopaddler,2011-03-26 23:14:00,8605,Wayne's World pops to mind. Pete needs his own version of Garth and he'd be set.
566382,landry,2011-03-27 04:44:00,1005,that was lame
566389,OhioFisherman,2011-03-27 10:09:00,6623,KVD seems kind of focused on his sport? Is it wise to challenge some one with that talent to focus on yours? You get to count follows? Sort of like counting your chickens before they hatch?
566395,silveradosheriff,2011-03-27 11:17:00,1025,I'm with Landry.......LAME!
566402,Terry,2011-03-27 12:19:00,14456,you know it was meant as humor ..right
566405,mercman,2011-03-27 12:29:00,7054,"Those who Know Pete can appreciate the humor in this Vid. This is someone who enjoys what he does, and has a ton of fun doing it.Lame, no way, funny, you bet"
566406,TroutnMuskieHunter,2011-03-27 12:33:00,1362,Nice bell bottom jeans Pete has...
566420,Roy,2011-03-27 12:54:00,13728,"Pete's is one of the most honest people I know. Loves to make people laugh. Has a super sense of humour. Knowing what kind of a dude Pete is, I thought the clip was hilarious."
566440,aplumma,2011-03-27 13:43:00,6896,Between his sense of humor and the vast knowledge he has amassed he is on my bucket list of people I want to fish with some day. I hope he continues to sell the pink hats and laughing with himself because it is what makes him special to all that know him.   Art
566481,landry,2011-03-27 15:05:00,1005,I have chatted with him and he does seem like a great guy. Down to earth and humble. I know it was supposed to be funny - it just wasn't really that funny I like his show musky shows a lot. Landry
566494,spinnerbaitking,2011-03-27 15:38:00,1622,"The Main A Vent, KVD vs Maina one day Bass & one day Musky, that would be cool to watch, Pete's maybe looking for show ideas lol SBK"
566503,tb4me,2011-03-27 16:12:00,3295,I wasnt all that impressed with his show. It was almost like he was trying to copy mercer a little with the humor. I wont watch another unless he changes it up a tad.. I will however watch any show that involves him fishing. That man can fish with me ANY time..
566676,NateFollmer,2011-03-27 23:28:00,19,"Glad most of you enjoyed it! Pete obviously likes to keep things fun and interesting, thats why you either love him or you don't."
566686,Roy,2011-03-28 00:02:00,13728,Pete copy Mercer???? I don't think so Bud. I guess you haven't been around that long. Mercer is his own dude. So is Pete. Neither of them have a mean bone in their body.
566928,Pete Maina,2011-03-28 19:39:00,213,"Hi,  Heard some comments on Vent here. As others as have mentioned, this is all in fun. (FYI I don't dare complain to or at video editor, as it's my wife ... if so   ) My humor isn't funny to all, I expect  No worries ... wasn't really intended as any challenge (and frankly don't really want Kevin getting all competitivey with muskies) ... actually be nice if we could just find time to fish together. If he's retired be easier. Anyway, all meant to be fun and generally unprofessional (who wants to be serious all the time). Kristen Landahl had a good idea and we're rolling with it. Esther takes part in the next vent, coming soon.  Heading to Ontario for one more shot at the hard water  Be well all!"
566935,Guest gbfisher,2011-03-28 19:53:00,0,  Can't Please em all Pete and......Bass are incidental...  
566941,Terry,2011-03-28 20:12:00,14456," yeah, real fish have teeth........  everything else is bait.............................LOL......"
567014,Radnine,2011-03-28 23:36:00,1538,If you listen very carefully you can actually hear this site jumping the shark. Jim
567015,Terry,2011-03-28 23:38:00,14456,sure Fonzie..........
567019,HTHM,2011-03-28 23:44:00,4082,"  He does have a point, winternet has been veeeeerrrrrrrryyyyyyy long this year."
567034,mercman,2011-03-29 00:18:00,7054,No it hasn't.Been a reel experience though
