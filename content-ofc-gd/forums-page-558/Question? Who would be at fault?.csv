567100,fishing n autograph,2011-03-29 01:34:00,2540,In terms of careless its usually lay the careless and let the courts give the break...when its careless there isn't much we can do at the side of the road
567118,HTHM,2011-03-29 02:14:00,4082,"Oh come on, you can always FIDO....."
567135,Dara,2011-03-29 02:39:00,3052,Personally...I don't rely on somebodys brake lights coming on before I slow down.
567138,irishfield,2011-03-29 02:51:00,26272,"With Dara stating that.. Cliff, didn't you recently have laser surgery for cats or was that someone else. Did they check your depth perception afterwards??"
567168,Big Cliff,2011-03-29 09:05:00,6899," I was traveling at the speed limit, it was an open section of road and I was a safe distance behind him (I did manage to avoid hitting him) If his brake lights had been working there wouldn't have even been an issue.  In in the last 40 years I have never had an ""at fault""  accident although I guy did run a red light about three years ago and T-Boned me and I almost managed to get out of his way. Hell I haven't even had a parking ticket in something like 35+ years so I'd say I'm probably a fairly safe driver LOL.   Yes I did Wayne, and yes they did check my vision and it is 20/20. I got a clean bill of health to drive without glasses. In fact it is probably better now than it has been in the last 20 years.   Anyway, there was no harm done, I just wondered who would have been at fault, I guess I have my answer now."
567234,Oggie,2011-03-29 14:51:00,588,"Not to be too irritating but maybe the guy was trying to get rear-ended.  If you use your e-brake to stop I don't think your brake lights ever come on.  A friend of mine was charged when he rear-ended a guy that was completely stopped in the middle of a highway on a blind corner.  Not sure if his brake lights were on but it wouldn't have mattered except maybe for the speed of the impact. Cam Wooley, the retired OPP, says ""it's never road conditions"", it's about care and control of your vehicle.   Don't think so Cam!  Dan O."
567248,Governator,2011-03-29 15:53:00,879,"I've driven twice behind vehicles with no brake lights.  One was an old van and the other an old pick up truck.  If you haven't been behind one of them you have absolutely no idea what you are talking about and can't comment that he has bad depth perception.  It's unbelievably difficult to tell when the vehicle slows down let a lone braking hard in front of you.  Mine were both on regular streets (Mapleview Drive, barrie), not a 400 highway and it was a real eye opener."
567250,irishfield,2011-03-29 15:58:00,26272,"33 years of, legally, being on the streets.. A good few years before that driving as well...  I couldn't possibly count how many brake lightless vehicles I've driven behind in that time frame.  As for"
567253,Governator,2011-03-29 16:13:00,879,"  Sorry I didn't realize that, I wasn't actually trying to single anyone out although I see it came off that way, my apologies.  I just get worked up over this topic after seeing it first hand and that it's pretty scary even on 50km/hr streets.  Pretty remarkable that someone can fly a plane with one eye, must feel good for him.  Curious, can he legally drive a car with one eye?"
567256,irishfield,2011-03-29 16:22:00,26272,"Took a lot of hoop jumping to get Transport Canada medical examiners to allow him to fly. But since they did.... simply based on the fact TC gave him an aviation medical I can't imagine the provincial authorities could stop him from driving. He has to stay sharp to spot land, that's for sure, but he stays on it and lands on his own tree surrounded VERY short airstrip. I won't even land there.. it's that short."
567266,Bernie,2011-03-29 16:42:00,3190,Years ago in my truck driving days I worked with a guy that drove tractor trailer with one eye. He was one of the better drivers too.
567276,Headhunter,2011-03-29 17:30:00,5703,Was that a cyclops truck Bernie?! HH
567286,Fish4Eyes,2011-03-29 18:16:00,1022,"Whenever you hit somebody from behind it is automatically your fault, regardless of what happened. In this case the officer would probably also ticket the motorist who did not have functioning brake lights as well. HTA states you must have full control of your car at all times, regardless of conditiions. People that end up in ditches due to bad weather all get pinned with Careless. Their throwing that careless charge at people like its nothing. A 6 point offence will ruin your life for a while.  FishNAutographs: If I were to get cut off, and in an attempt to swerve out of the way I lost control, would I still get pinned for careless? PS this did not happen to me, i'm just wondering."
567316,bdox,2011-03-29 20:09:00,329, I'm sure it's self explanatory but would you mind elaborating on this?
567353,irishfield,2011-03-29 22:22:00,26272," What I always thought as well... but it's not true. Daughter (Jen) totalled the rear of a Honda CRV and the entire front of my '98 GMC on the main drag in Collingwood one night after skiing Blue. Damn spare tire carriers on those CRV's or it would have been simple bumper damage and not $5300 in aftermarket parts going on my truck. Guy she ""rear ended"" was in the left lane.. she was in the curb lane and he decided to turn right into the gas station just after he passed her front bumper.. then slammed on the brakes and she tagged him right into the station. Office that responded charged him with improper lane change and also went to court with Jennifer when the guys father had him try to beat the charge.    Rare... but they get it right from time to time."
567438,Cookslav,2011-03-30 01:38:00,1457,Wow...I gotta say I always thought not having working brake lights would be a violation? It just seems wrong not to be?
566949,Big Cliff,2011-03-28 20:52:00,6899,"Was driving along today and suddenly the van in front of me was stopped, I hit the brakes and managed to pull to the shoulder without hitting him but thought to myself ""I never even saw his break lights come on, crap, I have to pay more attention!"" A few blocks later he stops again but this time I am watching and his brake lights aren't working at all. If I had hit him, who would be charged?  I managed to get up beside him and got him to roll down his window and told him he had no brake lights, he just laughed and said thanks then drove off. I probably should have reported it to the OPP but I hadn't written down his plate number or anything and he and I went different directions at the lights so I wouldn't have been much asssistance in helping them find him.  Would I have been charged with following too close or careless if I had hit him? It was a full sized van so I know I wouldn't have taken out his tail lights but I wouldn't have had anyway to prove that they weren't working before the accident."
566951,misfish,2011-03-28 20:59:00,29133,You both would of been charged.You following to close(since you already admit to knowing his lights were not working) and him for not having proper brake lights.IMO
566952,BillM,2011-03-28 20:59:00,17367,"You would have most likely been charged with failure to observe, or following to closely, etc.  It's a very rare circumstance when the person doing the hitting isn't the one with the ticket, even though this bozo deserved one, lol."
566954,spinnerbaitking,2011-03-28 21:01:00,1622,Sad to say but ya you likely would get charged for not having control of your vehicle & if it was me maybe Assault after I talked to him & we both loss our cool & I end up hitting him LOL ROAD RAGE lol SBK
566958,Big Cliff,2011-03-28 21:32:00,6899," I didn't know his brake lights wern't working when I almost hit him, I just thought I must have missed seeing them. There was no problem with me stopping the second time he did, that is when I realized that his brake lights were not working!"
566964,misfish,2011-03-28 21:50:00,29133," I stand corrected,you mentioned that you noticed it later. Still Cliff,you both get nailed."
566965,irishfield,2011-03-28 21:54:00,26272,"Careless for you Cliff.. nothing for him. He'd just tell them he had his arm out the window.. hand down. Still a legal means of showing he's stopping (if he was that smart at least). Only requirement, unfortuntely, is one white light front.. one red light (rear) after sunset, or to pass a safety check."
566983,Canuck2fan,2011-03-28 22:23:00,1444,"The guy probably watched a rerun of the show Wings and is trying to do what Roy Biggins did....  One of Roy's best stunts to make a few extra bucks. ""Everytime I see a Mercedes Benz in my rear view mirror I have switch that shuts off my brake lights... They hit me and the insurance company cuts me a cheque."""
566988,Pikeslayer,2011-03-28 22:30:00,1443,"Hi There Cliff, I was involved in a similar situation which resulted in an accident about 20 yrs ago. Long story short; It all came down to convincing/demanding that the OPP officer inspect the truck drivers signal/brake lights. They were not working and the truck driver was charged. My Integra was pinned underneath the trailer with me in it and I was able to get out of the car without a scratch. It all came down to the officers discretion (on checking the brake lights) as it seemed that he was very sympathetic to the truck driver and was reluctant to ticket him.  On the insurance side, Mrs. Slayer, all knowing insurance babe/love of my life says; Without an officer issuing a charge/ticket against the offending driver, you would be considered at fault and both claims for damages would go against your insurance. I'm seriously thinking of installing a camera in my car. Too many shenanigans going on on GTA roads that make the good drivers vulnerable for liability.  Regards, Simon  p.s. a big hello to Sue too."
566991,Whitespinnerbait,2011-03-28 22:37:00,2038, Really !!!!
566993,bdox,2011-03-28 22:38:00,329,"For anyone interested, here are the Fault Determination Rules. They are Government regulated and all insurance companies apply them to determine fault. Also, a quote from the IBC on how charges affect fault.  http://www.ibc.ca/en...ation-Rules.pdf "
566996,Big Cliff,2011-03-28 22:48:00,6899," Thanks for posting that! Doesn't seem fair some how, you don't expect someone to suddenly stop in front of you and their brake lights not come on. Isn't there a charge for having defective tail lights or something; Failure to signal???"
567003,LeXXington,2011-03-28 23:13:00,1928,My lights were working just fine until you ran into me
567020,umKthxbye,2011-03-28 23:48:00,247,He would have been charges since he is responsible to hav his light working. If a cop asked him to hit his breaks and they didn't work he wod be in deep poop. You could get away with saying you didn't notice him stop due to brake lights. But if there are witnesses you would also be charged for tailgating.
567026,vinnimon,2011-03-29 00:00:00,2593,"   2 white or amber lights in front and on red at the rear of the vehicle. Part VI section 62.(1) for minimal lighting on a vehicle. For conspiciousy. My rule of thumb, if its there, it must work regardless. Esp at the commercial level on an annual safety inspection.  I do recal inspecting and older vehicle from head to toe, only 3 lights were factory installed and mandatory at that time. Still legal to this day."
567027,didoban,2011-03-29 00:01:00,65,"don't matter if the brake lights are not working, u will be charged with following too close if you hit him.  You hit him, it's an at-fault to your record."
567028,Billy Bob,2011-03-29 00:04:00,5865," When it comes to insurance and vehicle accidents, most times your screwed 6 ways to the boat launch...LOL...but pretty much true.  Your Ontario laws might vary a bit to ours but what someone once told me is you MUST have control of your vehicle at ALL TIMES...just replace whatever vehicle you would of hit with a child and you will see in your mind that you would of been at fault....not saying the other van driver wasn't at fault also. Here he would receive a ticket for brake lights not working.  As far as vehicle inspection laws in NYS (held that license) ALL lights on vehicle MUST be in working order or removed including all said wiring. However there is a minimum light requirement which is basically all OEM lights. But if you have add on's like custom fog lights and only 1 works, your vehicle will fail the NYS yearly safety inspection. So you would have to remove those lights and all wiring to them....then it would pass.....unless you know someone who just sells stickers....LOL"
567059,Bernie,2011-03-29 00:39:00,3190,"The only legal requirement when I do a safety on vehicles is a licence plate light on the the rear and one tail light. Larger trucks and buses regulations are different. Brake or signals is not a requirement because hand signals use can make the vehicle legal. I can actually be charged by the ministry for forcing those to be repaired. On the front, both headlights must work and be properly aligned.  I know it doesn't make sense, but what government regulations do?"

567074,vinnimon,2011-03-29 01:05:00,2593, Not to bump this thread in any manner or butt heads. But A question for ya bernie. How can you/we be charged by the ministry? The customer can go elsewhere for a certificate if they are not happy with all the findings on the set vehicle.
567081,fishing n autograph,2011-03-29 01:15:00,2540," You got a raw deal....you can't follow a stopped vehicle...even then, the crown needs the other driver to specifically say that he saw you following to close. We're told always to lay careless instead  I woulda asked for fail to turn out to avoid a collision"
567085,Bernie,2011-03-29 01:18:00,3190, If you lead the consumer to believe it is required for the safety it is fraud and you can be charged if you bill them.  I just let the customer know what is or isn't a safety related item and let them make the decision on the non safety items. They almost always want the repairs recommended.
