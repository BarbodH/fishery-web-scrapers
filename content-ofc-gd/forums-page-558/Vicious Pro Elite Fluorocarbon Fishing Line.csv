566682,GBW,2011-03-27 23:42:00,8460,I have never soaked a reel to try that.  I always use the method I spoke about.  Time for a drink tho...  Why were there 5 cars out front today waiting for me to get home?
566695,danc,2011-03-28 00:23:00,4677,"I use mono exclusively. In fact I've never taken a cast with braid ever. I've heard of the ""soak your line in hot water"" thing many times. I've never done it and have never had a problem with line ""memory"". My go to line is Cabelas pro line mono. It's like six bucks for 2000 yards. I guess I'm getting old, but I still catch fish the old fashioned way with decades old methods. Braid?? Flouro?? Super lines?? They catch more fishermen than fish imho."
566700,SRT8 smoker craft,2011-03-28 00:32:00,1107, I take the spool off and just soak it although I have stopped using flouro main line and use braid with a flouro leader I have braid on all my reels now .
566806,rbaquial,2011-03-28 12:24:00,968," Me neither! I would imagine after soaking it, it'll loosen it up. but once it cools down again, I would imagine the line would conform to the spool again?? Anyone??"
566808,johnnyb,2011-03-28 12:37:00,3413,"It's a tip that's been around for a long time....I first came across it in one of Bob Izumi's books...he mentioned lukewarm water, not too hot.  The idea is to take the memory out of the line, as the diameter of the spool it's packaged on is likely different than that of your reel.  Of course it's going to conform to your reel eventually....if the line has sat for some time, you can always pop the spool off and soak it before you head out."
566304,GBW,2011-03-26 23:54:00,8460,So I wanted to try a new floro line and BPS had the Vicious Pro Elite Fluorocarbon Fishing Line on sale so I picked up a spool.  Anyone here use it?  Good/bad reviews?  The main use for this is to cast crank and jerk baits in a very clear lake as well as troll from time to time.  Thanks. Geoff  
566314,SRT8 smoker craft,2011-03-27 00:17:00,1107,Hey Geoff I haven't tried this kind but when you spool it up take your spool off and soak it in hot water takes alot of the memory out of it
566318,GBW,2011-03-27 00:28:00,8460,"Anytime I put a mono or floro line on I do this, but thanks.  Others may not know this."
566340,mercman,2011-03-27 01:53:00,7054,"   I for one,did not know this.Line memory is one of the reasons i switched to braid.Maybe now i will load mono on one of my reels and give it another go. I loaded my musky reel up with some of the new SpiderWire Flouro Braid, i picked up at Sail today.Looks and feels really nice. Cant wait to try it."
566344,GBW,2011-03-27 02:01:00,8460,"I get a bucket off one of my kids and fill it with HOT water and lay the spool in it, works like a charm."
566345,mercman,2011-03-27 02:06:00,7054,do i have to use one of your kids buckets or can i use a tupperware conatiner Just so i know..
566349,SRT8 smoker craft,2011-03-27 02:14:00,1107,LOL smart
566351,mercman,2011-03-27 02:18:00,7054,33 days till i get my new boat though !!!!!
566355,SRT8 smoker craft,2011-03-27 02:23:00,1107, 6 for me
566358,mercman,2011-03-27 02:31:00,7054,"Sorry Geoff I think i will go soak my `LINE` in a bucket of hot water. SRT8...in 33 days my boat will be new, and yours will be used!!"
566359,GBW,2011-03-27 02:37:00,8460,"Don't care as I'm going on hour 20 or so now so off to bed... FYI, it's use is as a main line if I didn't say it.  now time for bed..."
566361,mercman,2011-03-27 02:38:00,7054,Nite Geoff......sleep well
566369,SRT8 smoker craft,2011-03-27 03:00:00,1107,I prefer broken in over used
566370,mercman,2011-03-27 03:03:00,7054, nite buddy
566404,danbouck,2011-03-27 12:28:00,4380,You could use a sink... just sayin'
566407,mercman,2011-03-27 12:33:00,7054,Mornin Dan This really is a great tip.I dont know how many spools i went through last year because of tangles and knots. Never occured to me to warm it up while spooling Chalk it up to experience.
566413,Roy,2011-03-27 12:43:00,13728,"Also, when spooling a spinning reel, always lay the spool down with the label side up. When spooling a baitcaster, you can get someone to hold the spool with a dowel or pencil through it...keep the ling taut going on the reel.  I don't like fluorocarbon as a mainline at all. They make excellent leaders and tippets though."
566573,EC1,2011-03-27 19:13:00,930,"Let us know how you like the line. I wanted to try it too, but will be holding off for a short while before trying it out. It looks very good in terms of specs on paper though."
566574,Marko,2011-03-27 19:14:00,854,Great tip indeed...i have a question though. Would you soak the line in hot water before you spool it or after?  Hey Roy i recently purchased some Maxima fluorocarbon that i planned on using as my main line on one of my reels this year. I was looking forward to it....what didn't you like about using flouro as a main line??
566576,lookinforwalleye,2011-03-27 19:19:00,4399,soaking mono in hot water does what exactly?  I have never heard of this tip!
566588,SRT8 smoker craft,2011-03-27 19:39:00,1107,You soak the line after it's on the reel it reduces the memory from the manufacturers spool and the line doesn't fall off the spool as bad works the same for flouro or mono although it's less evident on mono it does help prevent tangles with new line .
566591,GBW,2011-03-27 19:44:00,8460,"before you spool it, takes out some of the memory from sitting on a shelf for a while."
566611,Marko,2011-03-27 20:29:00,854,"I did have couple of drinks but are you guys contradicting yourselves hahah ??   I am going to assume it would work both ways, i mean it makes sense.  Thanks!"
566626,Cudz,2011-03-27 21:09:00,2652,"True. But, for best results, use one of Geoff's kids' buckets."
566640,spinnerbaitking,2011-03-27 21:36:00,1622,"I bought 3 spools last weekend, 10, 14 & 20lb, Tubes, Crank Bait & Flip'n for sure, then we'll see what happens, SBK"
