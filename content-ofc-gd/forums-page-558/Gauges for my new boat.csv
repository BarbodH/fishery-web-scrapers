567149,Bernie,2011-03-29 03:04:00,3190,"I use the compass more than the GPS. Get a good one too, not one that spins in circles when hitting waves.  I don't trust my GPS. Especially when the chart doesn't show some islands on Nipissing.  Tach and voltmeter most important gauges."
567150,irishfield,2011-03-29 03:04:00,26272,I will follow anything I need at times. Ask DanC how I got to Marathon sometime...
567155,DRIFTER_016,2011-03-29 03:28:00,10439, Until the day you're out and your GPS breaks down in the fog.
567156,DRIFTER_016,2011-03-29 03:30:00,10439,  Refer back to my picture.  Richie Angler surface mount compass beside my finder/gps combo.
567157,Pikeslayer,2011-03-29 03:42:00,1443,What about a sktr gauge????
567211,Lungelarry,2011-03-29 13:07:00,294,"You don,t need a compass were you fish,just follow the steeples"
567318,mercman,2011-03-29 20:20:00,7054,"   You know the Area i see.!! It does have some beautiful scenery, especially at nite during the fireworks competition"
567340,Fisherman,2011-03-29 21:40:00,7201,"For those that poopoo the compass, ya better read the new boating regs.  I look over the back of my boat, water is whizzing out of the whizzer hole, I look at my gas tank and see a fuel gauge, I look at my GPS and it tells me how fast I'm going.  I look at my oil light and it tells me there's acceptable pressure."
567069,mercman,2011-03-29 00:58:00,7054,"Picking up my new boat at the end of april.Its a Princecraft Starfish DLX SC.40HP Merc 4ST. Its a basic boat, nothing fancy, and comes with no instrumentation.There are 4 spaces on the console for gauges.I was thinking of getting a trim gauge and a voltage gauge.My brother tells me that a water pressure gauge would be a better investment,than the voltage gauge.If you were me, which would you choose.  Thanks for any advice  Paul"
567077,danbouck,2011-03-29 01:10:00,4380,"definitely voltage, rpm, and fuel"
567079,FishAbout,2011-03-29 01:14:00,106,"Voltage gauge is better then a trim gauge.  When I trim I go by rpm and how the boat is running.  I drive a lot of boats where I work.   Water pressure gauge will tell you if your motor is pumping water, so you wont over heat it.  Speedo,rpm,volt and water pressure gauges."
567082,HTHM,2011-03-29 01:17:00,4082,"I have a water pressure gauge that you can have. BNIB. Black bezel, white face. Made by quicksilver so it is for a mercury motor. I would want to be hosted for dinner in Montreal as a price. So you're clear already."
567093,mercman,2011-03-29 01:25:00,7054,  WOW!!!!Thats perfect. Thanks Albert You gonna drop it off.We could do dinner again
567098,HTHM,2011-03-29 01:30:00,4082,"It might be cheaper for me to ship it, although with the jetta.... Dang your shipping address isn't on the screwdriver, PM me with it please."
567104,SlowPoke,2011-03-29 01:44:00,2984,"not all motors will have a trim sending unit... that might make your decision easy. I would go Tach, Speedo, Fuel, Volt. Most 4 gauge packages come with those; I paid $129 for mine."
567105,DRIFTER_016,2011-03-29 01:44:00,10439,"Here is my guage setup (I get to recycle this pic yet again    ) Speedo, volts, fuel, Rpm    The speedo and Rpm guages will be replaced with Merc Smartcraft guages when I repower the boat in a couple of years."
567114,mercman,2011-03-29 02:05:00,7054,"Thanks for all the help Guys Its a portable fuel tank, so that takes care of that.I will go with Tach, pressure(thanks Albert) and Voltage.I will have GPS so speed is taken care of also.  Paul"
567116,HTHM,2011-03-29 02:07:00,4082,"Not to brag, but.....i have tach, water pressure, gal/h, fuel left, volt, oil pressure and lots of other stuff in one. Smartcraft is kinda neat."
567123,Dara,2011-03-29 02:20:00,3052,"If you put a Yamaha on it and get a Lowrance HDS7 all the guages you will ever ned are built in. The moter plugs directly to the ""fish finder"" and gives you speed, rpm, temp, fuel level, comsumption, range left in the tank, and a bunch of other stuff I can't even remember."
567124,mercman,2011-03-29 02:21:00,7054,"  My Bro has that too on his Ranger.Being a Ranger owner yourself, You know nothing but the best is good enough for a Ranger"
567125,skeeter,2011-03-29 02:22:00,1907,What about a 12V power outlet? A good compass?
567129,Dara,2011-03-29 02:25:00,3052,It will also link with your marine radio and connect you with buddies that have the same setup. You can see their position on your GPS screen
567131,mercman,2011-03-29 02:30:00,7054,  wont need a compass with a GPS will i  The battery box is a Minn Kota power centre with 2 fused 12V outlets.
567132,irishfield,2011-03-29 02:31:00,26272,You never leave home without a compass do you Paul????
567136,mercman,2011-03-29 02:40:00,7054,  NEVER Should i get one.I don`t fish on any huge bodys of water.At least not yet.
567137,skeeter,2011-03-29 02:40:00,1907," No Paul you wont need a compass as long as you have that GPS, cause everybody knows that a gps can never die or quit working."
567140,HTHM,2011-03-29 02:52:00,4082,"Think of your compass as your back-up GPS, just like a pen is your back-up printer."
567141,irishfield,2011-03-29 02:52:00,26272,Always in my back pack Paul ! As well as one on the Lund's dash when I'm in it.
567142,mercman,2011-03-29 02:55:00,7054,ok ok !!! I will get a compass....Sheesh didn't know ya cared that much Any particular brand
567143,HTHM,2011-03-29 02:57:00,4082,"The one that works by magnetic attraction, not the one for drawing round circles......."
567144,irishfield,2011-03-29 02:58:00,26272,"LOL.. I have GPS in the plane, I still fly cross country with a map on my lap and compass for headings. It's called stayin alive when crap happens..... same works in a boat."
567147,mercman,2011-03-29 03:00:00,7054,  Nite Boys. Thanks
567148,HTHM,2011-03-29 03:01:00,4082,"Wayne, don't you hve your IFR? (I follow roads?)"
