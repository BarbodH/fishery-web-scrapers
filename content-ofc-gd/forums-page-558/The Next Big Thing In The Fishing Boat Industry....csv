566702,jediangler,2011-03-28 00:47:00,1923,This one is the Grand river version.  This one was called the SS Dumb & Dumber.
564805,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2011-03-23 01:20:00,0,Lund? Ranger?  Princecraft?  He's taking offers on his design! 
564807,HTHM,2011-03-23 01:21:00,4082,I thought winternet was over......
564813,BillM,2011-03-23 01:27:00,17367,That kinda looks like my pontoon when the Minn Kota is strapped on the back
564815,mercman,2011-03-23 01:28:00,7054,"what !!!!!!No cup holders  If that lawnchair falls across the battery terminal, Houston will have a real problem."
564820,ctranter,2011-03-23 01:33:00,543,The University of Alabama logos are icing on the cake!!!
564825,Muskieman,2011-03-23 01:35:00,2472,"Gonna build me one!!! sept no fome just some whit buckits an a folden chare,,,   No really... I'm probably gonna attempt building sumphin' like it this summer I have an old 28lb Minn Kota ..pedal drive kickin' around.. and a Muskoka Chair."
564836,BassAsin,2011-03-23 01:40:00,806,"I have troubles trying to make fun of  him. its very clever, inexpensive, gets him off shore and shows he has a huge passion for fishing.   Kudos to him."
564837,irishfield,2011-03-23 01:41:00,26272,It's not for fishin Matt.. the Beer store is on the other side of the river...
564851,BassAsin,2011-03-23 01:51:00,806,i praise him even more then!
564927,MillerPhoto,2011-03-23 06:33:00,147,"He needs to cut a slope to the front of those pontoons, get a little more speed on that thing.. lol"
564933,spincast,2011-03-23 09:08:00,3279,needs a litlle more room between the cross members to hold the cooler. the cardboard case will fall apart and then he will be bottonm fishin for his beer.
564934,pikehunter,2011-03-23 09:23:00,1659, Was thinking the same. Not much to do to improve on that either. Lot cheaper than a canoe or a store bought pontoon...Red Green has a fan from 'Bama
564974,fishindevil,2011-03-23 12:38:00,6254,"a few years ago,online i seen a pic of a guy that made one similar out of a picnic table,and 4 blue barrels...it was priceless!!!  and he had a foot pedal trolling motor on it as well..."
564977,Harrison,2011-03-23 12:40:00,2202, If you look really close I think you can see an engineer ring on his pinky!
564982,Billy Bob,2011-03-23 12:48:00,5865,I don't think it's nice to make fun of my family....
564993,Roy,2011-03-23 13:18:00,13728,"I hate shopping on Saturday mornings. Legs aren't what they used to be either. It's been easier since I got one of these. This week I'm working on a hitch attachment for a trailer cart.  <iframe title=""YouTube video player"" width=""480"" height=""390"" src=""http://www.youtube.com/embed/3x0M4-9EtAg"" frameborder=""0"" allowfullscreen></iframe>"
565000,mercman,2011-03-23 13:52:00,7054," Ya better be grounded Roy !!! Metal, rain and battery dont mix well."
565025,perchslayer666,2011-03-23 14:58:00,280,"You guys do know the Alabama logo's are shopped in right? This guy is actually from Barrie, and this pic was taken during the orillia perch festival a couple years back."
565046,ctranter,2011-03-23 15:34:00,543, Pretty sure they could have added Barrie Colts logos and achieved the desired effect as well   Just kidding
565077,mbosh1980,2011-03-23 17:23:00,349,And poorly shopped at that...
565084,Headhunter,2011-03-23 17:48:00,5703,It's to bad that there isn't a pic of his tow vehicle... with the 18in cutting blade! HH
566534,Tootsie II,2011-03-27 17:28:00,162,"Ok, laughingly playing part of typical Canadian bureaucrat: Is that thing considered a small vessel? Do you neeed an Operator's Card ? Does it have to have all the required safety equipment? Looks to me like it might have a high centre of gravity, so is it safe in high winds? Can you imagine trying to paddle it in high winds if the battery runs out. You'd probably be turning in circles! Only in Canada, AA"
566539,Drew_10,2011-03-27 17:46:00,111,"   Not to hi-jack this post, but this is one of my all-time favorites."
566556,Black_Blade,2011-03-27 18:43:00,258,We should start up a little design contest and have some voting on the entries by September...wouldn't that be a hoot!
566622,Cudz,2011-03-27 20:57:00,2652,That is not from Barrie. This one is though.  THE DIRTY SANCHEZ seen on the 400 leaving Barrie.  Had to snap a pic.
