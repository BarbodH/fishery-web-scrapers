The Pope leans towards Mr. Harper and said, ""Do you know that with one little wave of my hand I can make every person in this crowd go wild with joy?  This joy will not be a momentary display, but will go deep into their hearts and they'll forever speak of this day and rejoice!""  Harper replied, ""I seriously doubt that!  With one little wave of your hand....Show me!""     So the Pope backhanded him and knocked him off the stage!  AND THE CROWD ROARED & CHEERED WILDLY!  Kind of brings a tear to your eye, doesn't it?"
