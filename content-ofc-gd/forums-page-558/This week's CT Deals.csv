565979,Cudz,2011-03-25 22:41:00,2652,Talked to a buddy of mine who works for and is sponsored by live target and he told me the retail price of the frog should be $9.99 so that $10.99 deal must be regular ctc price.
565984,asdve23rveavwa,2011-03-25 22:47:00,2690,"Ended up doing the price match at Walmart, and, got a spool of 20 and a spool of 30.  Come on softwater!!!!!!!!"
566000,ADB,2011-03-25 23:30:00,444," Le Baron is $10.13, so your friend is right."
566008,BillM,2011-03-25 23:50:00,17367, Regular price at the Mapleview store was $13.  I was looking at them last week.
566012,spincast,2011-03-25 23:56:00,3279,"any opinions on the spooler? I See its on sale, wonder if its worth the money?"
566014,d_paluch,2011-03-26 00:01:00,343,"To answer the question on the live target frogs;  Canadian Tire adjusted their pricing, so they were 13.99 or something like that, and are now 10.99 regular price, everyday. The quantum rod/reel combo feels good! Can't remember for the life of me what model it was. I believe the reel is a 5 or 6 ball bearing. Like I said, it feels nice in the hands..."
566024,Nipfisher,2011-03-26 00:32:00,2449, Ihave had the spooling station for about 5 years now and I bought it used.It works well. It was even used in the truck on a fishing trip to Manitoulin Island.
566028,Nipfisher,2011-03-26 00:43:00,2449,  I went to Walmart in New Liskeard today on my way North and I could not believe how good the fishing section was. They had good sales on the soft water gear but the clearance deals on the winter stuff were amazing. All the Live forage stuff was on for $2. I had the boss looking over my shoulder so I'm gonna check out the deals in North Bay.
566415,ld17,2011-03-27 12:46:00,319,My buddy went to CT to get the line and they were sold out which is usual for CT.  But he got rain-checks so It's all good.
566451,Kawartha Kev,2011-03-27 14:03:00,281,Tried 2 Canadian Tire stores in Scarb. and East York both sold out of the Suffix anybody know of a store with a good stock don't want to bother with another trip for nothing!!
566457,Cudz,2011-03-27 14:11:00,2652,Take the flyer to walmart and they will price match.  done. easy.
566696,commie,2011-03-28 00:24:00,29," The Bayview/Sheppard CT had plenty of the Suffix's, in all sizes."
566714,BillM,2011-03-28 01:16:00,17367,Picked up the last spools of 10 and 20lb at the Barrie south store yesterday.
566716,ckrb2007,2011-03-28 01:21:00,449, So you're the culprit Bill. lol I stopped in there this morning while I was waiting for the propane station to open. I was hoping to grab another spool of 10lb test but they were all gone.....only 50lb left.  Colin
566723,BillM,2011-03-28 01:29:00,17367,Only 50lb left?  They had a rack full of 30lb the other night!  I got 1 spool of 10 and 2 spools of 20..  that's all I could find.. I didn't want 30lb.
566726,KGuppy,2011-03-28 01:32:00,18,"nothing here in markham, everything still Reg. prices"
566743,GoneFishin,2011-03-28 02:21:00,349,"I got to one in Oshawa at 9:45 and they only had one spool of 20lb left... wish I could have stocked up but it's still nice saving a bit of money. FYI This is nice line and is more water resistant then power pro and fire-line which helped a lot the other day with the ice build up from cold temps.. I'm also thinking about trying some on the pin, nice and supple plus it should just about float."
566753,BillM,2011-03-28 02:47:00,17367,I was thinking about replacing the 14lb Fireline on my pin with some 20lb Suffix.  I might give it a go and see how it works out.
566925,frozen-fire,2011-03-28 19:33:00,542,"Baitmaker roe tying material is also on sale at $1 each pack (100 pre-cut sheets) Regular price is $2.99. I just cleared out the CTC I checked out...only saw chartreuse though.  Also picked up one of the filet knives, but could not find any of the frogs... and only 1 spool of Suffix 832 left."
565538,niagarasteelheader,2011-03-24 17:01:00,12,Its in the flyer for the Niagara area too!
565587,Cudz,2011-03-24 20:03:00,2652,"Hey everyone, I am going to let you in on a little secret.  CTC (at least in Barrie) does something called one day before and one day after.  This means you can go into the store the day before the sale starts and get the product at the sale price and also if the sale ends you can go in one day late and still get the sale price. I always seem to get the product on sale before it sells out. Let's keep this between us. lol"
565589,irishfield,2011-03-24 20:08:00,26272,LOL.. Cudz.. how I got Terry his 3HP Jiffy @ 50% off.. the night before around 7pm and the price was already changed in the computer. Even if it wasn't you just bring it back the next day with their price guarantee and get your refund. (which was my original plan)
565591,Cudz,2011-03-24 20:13:00,2652,"Nice. The suffix line saving is pretty funny because walmart sells the 832 for $19.99 so it is 40% off the ctc price, not the price everywhere else. By the way walmart will pricematch anything as well so you cn just take in the flyer and get the line there too."
565592,adempsey,2011-03-24 20:16:00,1498,"I just saw this in my flyer as well.  Will have to see if my local CT carries it.   I just picked up three spools of Power pro too....but the 150yard spools were on sale at Le Baron for $12, so I am still happy =)"
565593,asdve23rveavwa,2011-03-24 20:17:00,2690," I didn't know that about Walmart. One way or another, I'm getting a few spools tomorrow. My new Citica, is looking naked without any line on it"
565594,toca,2011-03-24 20:18:00,274, Thats Sounds Kinda Klepto.....  Just Kidding Cudz Thanks For The Tip
565640,Twocoda,2011-03-24 22:39:00,4130, Save your money on the Suffix or bury it deep in the reel...IMO
565662,Bernie66,2011-03-25 01:01:00,123,Just got back from C.T. and picked up a couple of spools of suffix 832.  I went to the manager and he wrote me a slip to give to the casher for tomorrow's sales price. There were also other deals at this C.T. in Scarborough.  Picked up some Canadian Wigglers for $3 and Lyman lures for $2.  Great deals.
565707,asdve23rveavwa,2011-03-25 02:47:00,2690," Lyman's for $2!!!!!!!!  Man, I live in the wrong city"
565737,GoneFishin,2011-03-25 04:26:00,349," Actually, They will honor this, weeks after the sale! If I miss a sale or something is just really expensive I go to customer service and ask if it will be coming on sale. Sometimes they say they can't tell you if it will be on sale but they can tell you if it has recently, and chances are it has and they will always give you the sale price, 2 weeks after even. I know a lot of people don't want to be bothered but it can save you quite a bit just by asking a simple question."
565785,johnnyb,2011-03-25 12:32:00,3413,The CTC at Mavis & Britannia regularly has the weekend sale prices available on the Friday before.
565802,cynmar,2011-03-25 13:11:00,169,"I'm not a pro so opinion is ???? however, went to BPS during the sale and looked at the Sufix 832. Seemed awful stiff to me and would have some memory. Then again, I'm in love with Spider Thread as stays limp and holds up well. Did buy some Seaguar Abrazix though to put on the reel I use for float fishing. We'll see.  Bill"
565809,bigbuck,2011-03-25 13:35:00,2449,Braid isn't supposed to have memory so we'll see how this stuff is. $3 for Canadian Wigglers????? That's a great price for a great lure to either slow crank or troll. I've caught plenty of fish using them.
565847,addy79,2011-03-25 14:57:00,573,"went to the CTC at Dixie & Dundas. Got two spools of Suffix and two Live Target Frogs, for $50.76, just enough to get a $10 gift card from CTC as well (They have a promo where you spend $50 and get $10gift card back)  WHat a STEAL!!"
565853,johnnyb,2011-03-25 15:13:00,3413,"Nice play, capitalizing on the $10 gift card  "
565875,misfish,2011-03-25 15:49:00,29133,"Stopped and grabbed a spool.10 lb, equal to 4 lb mono dia."
565879,asdve23rveavwa,2011-03-25 15:52:00,2690,"Just checked the CT around the corner from where I work...nothing...no Suffix 832 AND no Live Target frogs Next stop at home in Woodstock, tonight."
565895,Nipfisher,2011-03-25 17:00:00,2449,I grabbed 2 Suffix 50# and 10# for $30.52. Live Target frogs were regular price?
565899,danbouck,2011-03-25 17:05:00,4380,grabbed 2 spools of 50lb suffix and a lot of spinnerbaits from BPS
565916,addy79,2011-03-25 18:49:00,573, I thought they were more than $10? The larger frogs I got were reg. 12.99 and I got em for $10.
565930,fisher12,2011-03-25 19:45:00,81,"If anyone saw the Quantum combo yet, Can you please tell me the information on the rod and reel combo(line capacity etc.)? Thank you"
565953,Banger68,2011-03-25 21:00:00,157,If anybody is looking for the Sufix in London go to the east store on Dundas. The line is hidden under the display. They had several spools still.
565970,salmon,2011-03-25 22:09:00,334,"Brampton stores have no Sufix braid, at least the ones I have been to. Figures the only time I go to CTC stores for fishing stuff and they have nothing I want"
565976,bigbuck,2011-03-25 22:35:00,2449,"One of my local stores had 50, 30 and 20lb test line in  the Suffix. I picked up some 50 for one of my baitcasters, a frog, a fillet knife (can't have too many of those), some hooks, jigs and odds and ends."
565103,MSBruno,2011-03-23 18:14:00,369,"FYI, some good deals here.  Check your local flyer for more deals.    "
565113,beginner,2011-03-23 18:35:00,542,thnx for the info... I go get one of the fillet knife.... Its a good deal..
565121,skinny,2011-03-23 18:42:00,442,I have one of those knifes and I find it a bit stiff for doing perch
565122,PikeMolester,2011-03-23 18:42:00,428,what the hell Here CT don't even have live target OR Suffix. The Filet knives are 30$. Just went today
565124,MSBruno,2011-03-23 18:48:00,369, Deals start Friday
565127,BillM,2011-03-23 18:50:00,17367,Thanks for the heads up!  I might try some of that Suffix on the pin.  Definitely going to pick up a LiveTarget Frog for the oldman
565128,PikeMolester,2011-03-23 18:50:00,428,I was a little hasty lol but still the only thing we even have in Montreal West Island Canadian tires is the knife
565143,d_paluch,2011-03-23 19:21:00,343,"wow, and the CT i work at this saturday has a $10 giftcard when you spend $50 before tax. The suffix n livetarget are in my sights"
565147,misfish,2011-03-23 19:30:00,29133, Was thinking the same.A couple of spools.
565179,bubbles,2011-03-23 20:31:00,591,"Ofcourse the Suffix is on sale this week, I spooled up LAST WEEK!"
565183,asdve23rveavwa,2011-03-23 20:42:00,2690,Thanks for the heads up!!
565204,Lunatic,2011-03-23 21:24:00,536,Just checked the hamilton area online flyer and not one fishing related item was listed.
565206,SBCregal,2011-03-23 21:29:00,688,"bubbles, go in and ask for a refund for the difference.  ive done it in the past with no problems"
565209,cram,2011-03-23 21:32:00,1733,Is Sufix good?  I have never tried it....
565215,GBW,2011-03-23 21:43:00,8460,it's brand new.  do a search on sufix and you will see a review that is a few pages long from garry2rs
565216,Garry2Rs,2011-03-23 21:46:00,1425,"  I have been using Sufix 832 #10 on plastics and #30 on cranks all winter, down here in the sunny south.  I think it's the best braid I have ever used. Garry2R's"
565218,GBW,2011-03-23 21:50:00,8460,and there you have it...
565220,asdve23rveavwa,2011-03-23 21:52:00,2690, You won't see it until Friday.
565292,Rattletrap2,2011-03-24 00:25:00,1652,"This is very interesting regarding the Suffix line. I tried a few of the braided lines years ago and was not impressed at all. This year, I was thinking of giving them a try again and I have been bombarded with reviews of Suffix Line. Seems like this is the one to go with for a renewed try? I spoke to a fellow today that absolutely loves it!  Now if Garry says it is good stuff, I'm sold!"
565308,lookinforwalleye,2011-03-24 00:55:00,4399," Same here Brian I have tried several brands of braid and really haven`t liked any of them, but like you I think I will try the new Suffix line due to the reviews. We`ll see how it goes!"
565309,danbouck,2011-03-24 00:57:00,4380,Maybe it's time I tried a switch from power pro to Suffix. Can't beat that price
565313,solopaddler,2011-03-24 01:02:00,8605,"    I've currently got all my reels spooled with Suffix 832.  It's great braid, but at least imo, not vastly different than my old Power Pro."
565445,umKthxbye,2011-03-24 12:36:00,247,"I just bought a 300yard spool of the neon lime 50lb for my baitcaster and it feels and looks nice and strong. Ill probably pick up some 10lb for my spinning rod. To bad they only have the moss green in Canada. I'm lucky enough to have the new CT in Kingston. It VERY fining oriented. They got a huge fish tank with bass and other fish in it and sooooooo many other products I've never seen in a CT. And the best part is, i don't have to walk to the back to get to it. Its the first thing when you walk in the store. The manager is sponsored and fishes tournaments i think."
565468,bigbuck,2011-03-24 13:22:00,2449,I'm going to try frogging this year and I've heard good things about the Koppers frog. That's a decent price on braid too so I'll see what they have at my local CTs.
565499,perchslayer666,2011-03-24 15:00:00,280,Wow good deal on the suffix....Leave some for me will ya!!!!
