566687,Rizzo,2011-03-28 00:04:00,4754,"Is this the stretch between Big Chute and Swift rapids? If so, the fishing is ok, I just don't care for the boat traffic. I make it my first trip of the year, before everyone has their boats in the water! If you're down one of the bays/channels I guess it would be a bit more peaceful but that stretch around severn falls is a bit of a bottleneck at times."
566691,Rizzo,2011-03-28 00:15:00,4754,"oops sorry, just read the title again. I guess you mean between swift rapids and sparrow, unfortunately I've never been that way so can't help you out"

567272,fisherman7,2011-03-29 17:05:00,325,"Thanks for the info so far, much apprecaited. Just to clarify, the location were looking at is on the river, downstream from Couch Lock 42, to where it feeds into Sparrow, near Lauderdale Marina.  Just curious about fishing and people's general thougths about living on the river."
