566547,lew,2011-03-27 18:23:00,12766,"I had a bunch of maple kitchen cabinet doors to sell and posted them in the OFC classifieds last week as I wanted to give  OFNers 1st crack at them if there was any interest, which unfortunately there wasn't.  I posted them on kijiji at 9:00 this morning and had 3 replies within 30 minutes. The 1st guy that replied showed up here at 1:30 with cash in hand for the full price and the deal was done and the doors were on their way to a new home.  4 1/2 hours from placing the add till the $$$$ changed hands is pretty good service in my books  Now what am I gonna do with all this extra moolah ??"

566559,Joey,2011-03-27 18:45:00,9122,"Ya, I've sold many things on Kijiji that went in a flash Lew.  The snowmobile was the fastest, followed by the boat.  Both went within 24 hours.  Great place and mostly honest people.  Now I think you should go buy Diane something nice"
566561,lew,2011-03-27 18:49:00,12766, shhhhhhhh
566594,MCTFisher9120,2011-03-27 19:50:00,3761,"Definitely a good resource. I'm always scanning for a nice used boat trailer for my 12'...want to find one for a project late this summer to fix up.  That's a fast sell, nice job!"
566607,SlowPoke,2011-03-27 20:27:00,2984,kijiji is great and bizcaf is gaining momentum too. Use the bonus bucks for all the new black and white counter appliances LOL
566615,Moosebunk,2011-03-27 20:33:00,3970,You just can't be fast enough many times with that site Lew.  Good quick sale for ya.
566655,adempsey,2011-03-27 22:21:00,1498,Your wife might want some new doors to replace the ones you took off and sold? Lol =)  It's amazing what you can sell.   It's always a good idea to take a look at what your workplace is throwing out.  Some workmates have made some good $$ salvaging parts to sell on those sites.
566678,Pigeontroller,2011-03-27 23:35:00,2793,  Odyssey?
566681,lew,2011-03-27 23:41:00,12766, It's a good idea Dax but I'm not gonna make the Odyssey this year. Gonna be the 1st one I've ever missed.
566685,Rizzo,2011-03-27 23:57:00,4754,"We'll miss you there Lew! Have to agree about Kijiji. I've sold my boat, winter tires and some furniture really fast. Bought a canoe on it as well"
