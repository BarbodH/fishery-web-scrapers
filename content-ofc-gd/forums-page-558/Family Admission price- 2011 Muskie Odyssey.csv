566347,skeeter,2011-03-27 02:08:00,1907,To drive down to st.catherines for a muskie show?  You would have to be a MUSKIOT !!!!!
566356,Pigeontroller,2011-03-27 02:26:00,2793,Hey thanks for the bump!  Lots of Muskiots coming from all over Ontario!  I bet some of them will stop at Tims!
566423,Handlebarz,2011-03-27 13:00:00,3790,You dont just have to be a muskiot to come out to this show as there will be pike sized lures also along with rods/reels that are right for both musky and salmon use.  There is also Joscelin from Angling outfitters who will have great deals on his electronics and doing presentations on them all day I hear he is also doing upgrades at his booth but have not talked to him to confirm this maybe Dax knows.  Trojan tackle will be there with all there great boat products on display to help get your boat set up for everything from Walleye trolling to down rigging for salmon with multi rods on the big water to even have stuff for your boat to pull the tubes behind and of coarse musky rigs also.  Yes this show is geared to Muskiot's but there is enough other stuff that if you need something to do on the Saturday stop in for a while then take the kids to the falls to watch the water.
