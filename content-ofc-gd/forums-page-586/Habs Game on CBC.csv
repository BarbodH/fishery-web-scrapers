542536,Gregoire,2011-01-23 01:45:00,1397,How many power plays are the Ducks going to get? This is Bull!
542537,Leecher,2011-01-23 01:47:00,7832,Another goal for the Ducks..... Man they are really getting me mad right now
542538,solopaddler,2011-01-23 01:53:00,8605, Pretty much the truth. If more viewers actually wanted to see the Habs then they'd show it in HD.
