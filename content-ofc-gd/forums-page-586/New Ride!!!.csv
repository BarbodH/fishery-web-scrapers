Good on ya!. - Hard, but stick with it, its worth it!  then you can get a fishfinder / plotter, trolling motor, new set up, custom canvas....... last pack I bought was at a Mac's Milk. said for years I would quit when it was a buck a pack, remember those days? Paid $1.05 for a 20 pack then quit - cold turkey  Tough, but paid off. good luck and stick with it"

540290,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2011-01-17 01:52:00,0,that's just about the best reason to quit smoking i've ever seen!  the patch wouldn't be necessary if all wives were as cool as yours!  (can you talk to my wife by chance?)
540304,Grimace,2011-01-17 02:27:00,2020,In a couple of weeks I will be at a year without smokes.  I smoked 2 packs a day.  You can do it.  First couple of weeks is really rough.  Now I do not even crave anymore. You will be fine.  You better be or your old lady will kill you.  You can't go back on it now you have the boat.  Good luck
