542542,danc,2011-01-23 02:06:00,4677,Lots of class from both of you guys. Well done.
542569,silveradosheriff,2011-01-23 02:45:00,1025,"Thanks for the great day guys, and Justin it was a pleasure meeting you!"
542582,silveradosheriff,2011-01-23 03:03:00,1025,Forgot to thank Barry....the Laker was yummy!     
542599,FishAbout,2011-01-23 03:26:00,106,"Rod I heard the day didn't get any better on the way home with the trailer. The day started of bad when barry got the van stuck, then we couldn't get the big hut out with all the slush.  At least you weren't cold with the portable hut.  We did get the big hut of johns out the next day.  Everything went much better. You guys will have to come up again sometime."
542617,siwash,2011-01-23 03:59:00,683,Where can one access Lake Muskoka to ice fish? I hve never ice fished it but have considered doing so..  Thanks
542618,siwash,2011-01-23 04:00:00,683,"  By S. Ontario standards that is a big fish.. a brood stock for sure.. still, it's in his right to keep it!  I would have, too.."
542626,Grimace,2011-01-23 04:09:00,2020,  They were fishing Rosseau.
542628,siwash,2011-01-23 04:17:00,683,"  Oops, missed that! Where can  Rosseau be accessed?  Thanks!"
542632,Grimace,2011-01-23 04:24:00,2020,  Windermere is no secret.  Other than that I would have to kill you.  The undertapped fishery would be the monster pike.  Rosseau is funny fishery.  You can fish Rosseau for a long time before you catch a thing but that thing might be a 12 pound walleye.  Strange scary ice will be a deterrant as well.
542635,siwash,2011-01-23 04:33:00,683,"  Hahahaha!! Thanks bud! Please don't kill me!  Well, I might stick to Simcoe then.. even if it's mostly inaccessible these days, according to the latest rant on Inisfil bylaws!  Guess I'll just drive around until I find a legal spot to park...  thanks"
542642,FishAbout,2011-01-23 04:49:00,106,"Rosseau and Lake Muskoka have very few spots to access the ice.  Windermere has good parking and a short walk. Lots of small lakers not even worth eating though.  Almost need a machine to get around the lakes.  Need to know the lakes and what areas freeze first, some areas never get anymore then 8 inchs of ice all winter.  There are big fish to be caught though, Have to put your time in and you will catch them.  Some spots just seem to hold bigger fish."
542657,siwash,2011-01-23 06:04:00,683,"  Thanks! 12"" are good for the pan!!!"
542690,MCTFisher9120,2011-01-23 14:15:00,3761,Awesome catch buddy and great video!
542181,iceguy,2011-01-22 03:04:00,341,Watch in HD 
542184,Muskieman,2011-01-22 03:16:00,2472, Are you in the Video?  Is that you?  Nice Fish!!  Randy 
542185,4x4bassin,2011-01-22 03:19:00,1025,"That is a very nice,laker but....... I can see where this is going to go !!"
542199,mbac31,2011-01-22 03:47:00,904,Thats a nice fish man. I see my good friend there with you as well. Tell FB I said hi next time.
542207,danc,2011-01-22 04:13:00,4677, The dinner table??
542209,irishfield,2011-01-22 04:15:00,26272,LOL Dan! I don't see the issue. Lakers are open in 15.. unless it's the swearing! lol
542211,Grimace,2011-01-22 04:20:00,2020,What a beauty.   Great video.  I must be missing something as well as I don't see the problem.  Great Laker lads.  Nice colour on her as well.
542217,discophish,2011-01-22 04:51:00,392,"Congrats!  Really nice laker, impressive colour.  Looks like a really good time out there with the boys.  Great job handling the technical difficulties.  I can't wait until next weekend to do the same."
542220,DRIFTER_016,2011-01-22 05:17:00,10439,"Yep, that's a perfect BBQing sized laker."
542229,4x4bassin,2011-01-22 06:13:00,1025,"All i'm saying guys is that in ""my"" opinion that fish would be better off in the lake then on the table. I'm all for keeping some for the bbq but not this size (smaller ones taste better) Anyways I guess i'm the minority on this one !"
542231,Grimace,2011-01-22 06:25:00,2020,"  So I guess that the statement ""I know where this is going"" has now been changed to ""I know where I am going to try to put it.""  How about this?  He kept a legal fish.  Your not a minority on this one.  I would rather keep a smaller fish as well. BUT. It is not like it is an enormous laker.  What is it? maybe 7 pounds, maybe 9.  A beauty, but not one of a kind.  Cut the dude some slack, I beg you.  Especially after that fight with all the lines.  Prolly a good idea to keep it.  Nice fish dude."
542232,BillM,2011-01-22 06:34:00,17367,"It's not a monster, no reason not to BBQ that one.  Now if it was like 30lbs, then I'd have a different opinion."
542264,Rod Caster,2011-01-22 14:07:00,5784,What a beauty. That rod was keeled right over...sweet.  
542267,Gregoire,2011-01-22 14:37:00,1397, Gotta agree with Grimace on this one. No need to give the guy flak over a fish of that size. I love it when people post pics and videos. Giving them a hard time gives them a reason not to post.
542268,solopaddler,2011-01-22 14:37:00,8605,"Nice laker, thanks for posting the vid.  As far as eating it goes, why not if you want to.  I lived in the area for a few years and would never eat lakers caught from lake Muskoka. They're loaded with mercury."
542281,DRIFTER_016,2011-01-22 15:20:00,10439,"  Exactly, it's only in the 6-8 pound range. Far from big. I wouldn't keep any fish over 28"" and this fish looks to be in that size range.  For instance this guy> Released    These guys> BBQ'd    "
542412,Leecher,2011-01-22 21:11:00,7832,Awesome video iceguy    Love it Congrats to the guy that fought & land it Leechman
542480,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2011-01-22 23:06:00,0,Quite the fuss to get it in! Nice fish.
542482,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2011-01-22 23:09:00,0,"  You're not in the minority necessarily because many of us would put it back for various reasons (like eating smaller fish, maintaining brood) inc  The difference is that ""many"" of us also know when something isn't really our business."
542486,FishAbout,2011-01-22 23:44:00,106,"I was the one that caught that laker. I have caught many bigger then that one.  I do not usually keep them that big but the wife's parents wanted fish and fishing was tough that day so i decided to keep it. Sorry if some feel that it should be released.  I like to eat the small ones also.  There are lots of big lake trout in Lake Rosseau.  Posts like this is why I do not post here.  That lake trout hit when I went into the hut, I left the drag really lose so if one hit it would not pull the rod down the hole. It has happened to me before.  After being in the hut for 10 mins, Rob(iceguy) hooked into a fish so he thought.  I thought I better check my line outside to make sure it was ok. The fish had taken all of the line out right to the knot on the reel.  While taking all my line out it circled and caught 5 of the other lines. It was a disaster.  I wish I could of set the hooks on it and fought it on the rod the hole time."
542487,Grimace,2011-01-22 23:46:00,2020,Well done.  She is a beauty.
542516,4x4bassin,2011-01-23 01:06:00,1025,"You are exactly right it is not my business and I was under the impression that this fish was alot bigger than it was , Sorry guys !!!! Fishabout/Iceguy , I really hope comments like mine do not stop you from posting other vids. because I truly enjoy reports like yours , honestly , keep it up . I couldn't believe you actually got that fish in with that mess , well done !"
542524,Joey,2011-01-23 01:23:00,9122,Great video and nice laker.  I just might have kept her for the BBQ aswell  Joey
542525,Grimace,2011-01-23 01:23:00,2020, Right on man.
542530,Gregoire,2011-01-23 01:27:00,1397, Anyone can make a mistake...it takes a big man to admit when he has made one. Well played sir.
