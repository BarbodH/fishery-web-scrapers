So I went and drilled a bunch of holes and each spot kept the water on top instead of running back into the hole and ""drying"" up. Does this mean that the snow is just melting from on top of the ice or could it be a spring that constantly puts water on top..I don't recall seeing water like this before here.  Thanks"
542345,BillM,2011-01-22 18:41:00,17367,Sounds like the snow is insulating the water that accumulated during that small warm spell we had last week.  That's most likely the run off you are seeing.
542348,walleyejigger,2011-01-22 18:46:00,876,"the snow weighing down the ice a little so some water has surfaced maybe, i know we see this alot close to the end of the season around here,  once you drill you're hole water comes up and doesn't go back down sometimes flooding ur area,  just a theory"
542354,livinisfishin,2011-01-22 18:55:00,661,I think you could both be right..its a spring fed lake and nobody ever fishes on it so there is nobody else to really talk to about it and very few sled seem to cross it.
542400,limeyangler,2011-01-22 20:50:00,5204,For sure i would say its the pressure of the snow on the ice...seen it lots at early ice here. Especially this year cuz we had lots of snow.
542403,irishfield,2011-01-22 20:57:00,26272,If you want lots of water/slush on the ice... just invite Ron fishing with you and try to use the same spot the next day! Something about swiss cheese...  The weight of the snow has the ice at or below the true water level.. you drilling a hole lets said water out.
542406,Leecher,2011-01-22 21:04:00,7832,"That's just the weight of the snow pushing down on the ice and until the ice thickens, it will be that way Leechman"
