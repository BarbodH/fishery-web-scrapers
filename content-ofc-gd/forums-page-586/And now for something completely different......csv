Actually he owned many of the buildings on Yonge, between Dundas and Gerrard street. Including I beleive, the old A&A records building. Sam made most of his money distributing records to his franchised stores across the country... not much if any at the flagship store. Actually, the flagship store was intended to be a tax right off for his distribution company, Roblans. Roblans is/was located on Church street, just north of Dundas. As a tax shelter, he would sell his records to his stores at the suggested retail price, then sell them at the retail level, to the customers at a lower price. The stores showed a loss, the distributor, a profit. The lion's share of profit at the retail level was garnered from what were called ""catalogue"" releases, stuff that was not a ""new release"". These items were almost always sold at full price. Funny, go for a walk up Yonge street today and most of the old building has been torn down, making way for the new Ryerson building.
