Punched a few holes and set up a couple huts, even got his brother out for a while. Fishing was tough, not sure if it was a rough zone or the bite wasnt on today. Cal managed a couple fish, I lost my only one on the way up because I stopped reeling to grab the camera.  Ah well, its the way she goes... Tomorrows looking too cold for my blood, but I'll be back atter shortly...  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4a4_qbQyqUY"
