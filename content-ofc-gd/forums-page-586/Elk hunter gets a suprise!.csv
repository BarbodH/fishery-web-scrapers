541911,mercman,2011-01-21 15:35:00,7054,"NOPE.... not photoshopped.if you look carefully, branches and leaves appear in front of the cougar.this appears to be a real photo."
541912,Muskieman,2011-01-21 15:38:00,2472,"Looks real... tell ya one thing, he sure won't need his binoculars to get a close look at that Puma.."
541914,Roy,2011-01-21 15:43:00,13728,It's a composite photo. The mountain lion shot was taken by a California biologist.

541917,thatleetboy,2011-01-21 15:49:00,143," Definitely. Look at the shadows being cast from the flash....  On the hunter, the light is high, slightly camera left.... on the cat, the light comes from the right.  As well as the evidence photo above...   Fun though."
