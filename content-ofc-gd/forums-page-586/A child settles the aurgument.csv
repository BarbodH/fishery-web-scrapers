Sitting in the front seat of the fire truck was a Dalmatian dog.  The children started discussing the dog's duties.  ""They use him to keep crowds back,"" said one child.  ""No,"" said another. ""He's just for good luck.""  A third child brought the argument to a close....  ""They use the dogs,"" she said firmly, ""to find the fire hydrants."""
