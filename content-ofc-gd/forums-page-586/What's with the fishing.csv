542485,2advanced,2011-01-22 23:35:00,53,Can't catch a break today.  Out at IBP today around 85fow sonar is going off all morning marking tonnes of fish  No takers all morning  Hearing others rant where is all the whitefish all day lol  Time to hit the supermarket
542489,mercman,2011-01-23 00:00:00,7054,i'm wondering if it has something to do with the dry summer we just went through.Even the softwater fishing was no h-ell this year. low water levels put stress on the fish maybe
542490,NAW,2011-01-23 00:01:00,4022,"It's been a weird start to the season.  That's for sure.  We managed 2 today between my fishing buddy and I.  Once we get a bit more ice, and can move out into the middle a little more, things will get better."
542494,FishAbout,2011-01-23 00:13:00,106,Could it be more people fishing and stocking less fish.
542499,2advanced,2011-01-23 00:26:00,53,Stocking less.  It seems like they vanished lol  I remember a couple of years ago you setup and you're off the ice in the car within 2 hours cause you've got your limit lol  This is the case for perch lol
542503,misfish,2011-01-23 00:33:00,29133,"Stocking is at the norm,but look at the opening weekend catches in the spring and the 2 months to follow.Lots of whities being taken in this time as they seem to concentrated in this one area."

542591,2advanced,2011-01-23 03:19:00,53,Big bay point seemed to have a ton of people..I'm not sure where people are finding parking there??
542594,2advanced,2011-01-23 03:20:00,53,It almost looked like a mini city lol
542658,siwash,2011-01-23 06:28:00,683,"   We didn't have a dry summer here.. actually, we got a fair amount of rain, especially June and August. It's a put n take fishery so I doubt that would factor in anyway.."
