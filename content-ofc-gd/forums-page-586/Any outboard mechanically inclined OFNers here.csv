541446,DRIFTER_016,2011-01-20 00:56:00,10439,I'm looking at an OB online and was hoping someone with some mech experience local could check it out for me. Looking to purchase and get it handed over to a friend in the Hammer and I will pick it up in May when I come to Ontario for my trip to Attawapiskat. The motor is in Whitby. I still need to contact the seller to see if it's still available but wanted to see if someone would check it out for me.  What says yooze guyz.
541451,solopaddler,2011-01-20 01:12:00,8605,I asked Dave to post this 'cause I'm a bit too far away to go for a look.  It'd be great if someone could have a look at it.  If it pans out I can pick it up for him when I have the time.
541476,greenfshrmn,2011-01-20 03:18:00,65,"Hi Guys, I live in Whitby and would be able to go check out the motor for you.  Just let me know the particulars when you're ready."
541480,GBW,2011-01-20 03:26:00,8460,"and solo, I can pick up and hold it for you if needed as I'm in Brooklin, just a bit North of Whitby.  as for looking at it, can't offer to much help there."
541486,HTHM,2011-01-20 04:14:00,4082,"I'm headed out to Quebec soon, can grab it on the way back, depending on size..."
541487,solopaddler,2011-01-20 04:28:00,8605,"Thanks a bunch everyone!  Albert it's a 4 horse 2 stroke with an integrated tank, so not big at all.  If Dave buys the motor that would save me a trip out there and back.  Dave you'd best start pm'ing these fine gents and making arrangements.   OFC is great"
541488,DRIFTER_016,2011-01-20 04:56:00,10439,Thanks everyone. I am waiting to hear back from the guy that has the motor and will let y'all know when he will be available. Hopefully this weekend. So if you can let me know who's available this weekend I'll try and set things up tomorrow.
541504,GBW,2011-01-20 13:31:00,8460,I'm open Sat afternoon to pick up if needed.
541891,GBW,2011-01-21 15:01:00,8460,"Dave, I'll PM you my email addy too.  I can either get it on my way home from my kids skiing lessons or after 1:00PM on Sat."
541893,solopaddler,2011-01-21 15:05:00,8605,Albert (HTHM) can pick the motor up next Thursday from Whitby and deliver it to me.  Dave have you bought the thing yet?
