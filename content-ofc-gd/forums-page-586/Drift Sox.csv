541963,Billy Bob,2011-01-21 17:36:00,5865,"Cabela's has them on sale......looking for those who have experience in using them, particularly in what size I should get for my 16'4"" Grumman that has a 84"" beam and is 39"" deep....here is the choices.  Thanks for your time,  Bob  http://www.cabelas.com/product/Home/New-for-2011-Marine-Accessories%7C/pc/105625080/c/106991280/Cabelas-Advanced-Angler-Pro-Series-Drift-Socks/700074.uts?destination=/browse.cmd%3FcategoryId%3D106991280%26WT.tsrc%3DEML%26WT.mc_id%3Demail-nl%26eid%3D39774%26cmp%3DI110119A%26seg%3DFI1%26cnt%3D6547%26ctb%3Dbrowse.cmd"
541965,mercman,2011-01-21 17:50:00,7054,"Generally, sock size should match shoe size.  "
541966,SmokestackLightnin,2011-01-21 17:55:00,390,Depends on what your needs are.  I keep 3 on my Nitro and depending  on the wind and how slow I want presentation I will use all three if needed.  Does the Cabela brand come with a storage pouch?  I noticed that these ones are the same price as the XL Minn Kota at its regular price and I think the Minn Kota comes with a storage pouch.  The pouch is handy so the straps don't get in the way as they tend to unravel in my storage comparments.  My personal recomendation for your boat is buy two of the XL size.  You may think it's a bit of overkill but that should prepare you for just about anything.
541969,Roy,2011-01-21 18:01:00,13728,"I would have suggested two 38 inchers, Bob. Don't get the small nor medium as they have no collapse cord."
541992,Pikeslayer,2011-01-21 18:40:00,1443, What Roy said You definitely want to have the collapse cord to retrieve the sox.
541995,Grimace,2011-01-21 18:53:00,2020,Collapse cord is a MUST.  Also the adjustment on the back of the bag as well so you can let more water through when the wind is a bit lighter.
541996,Bob Devine,2011-01-21 18:57:00,251,I have 2 XL's in my boat 21' Ranger Fisherman. These are much better and durable than the MK brand.
541998,Drew_10,2011-01-21 19:06:00,111,"Get the biggest ones you can afford.  I have 2 Lindy's Drift Control socks, 48'' models. They work great on my 19' 3'' bass boat.  Bigger is better, especially if you have a boat that sits high in the water, like a deep V.   You can probably use something a little smaller though.  Use strong rope that isn't frayed (don't ask how I know) and you may want to consider using a couple carribeaners with a swivel to attach to your cleats to prevent the ropes from twisting."
542248,Billy Bob,2011-01-22 12:02:00,5865," The MK sox doesn't say anything about a storage bag but I have plastic bags that I can store the Cabela's Advanced Angler Pro Sox and the Cabela's has a better customer rating.  I'm leaning towards XL size....maybe 2 sox's....waiting for my Cabela's CC Points to be credited before the end of the month......I also want to get a Nikon scope for my shotgun plus rings....If I spend $150 I get $20 off so that makes the shipping FREE and NO SALES TAX....  :clapping:  Thanks for everyone's help and time, Bob"
542273,Cudz,2011-01-22 15:04:00,2652,"I have a lindy 48"" but to tell you the truth, my IKEA bags work just as well and they cost me $1.00 each. That is just my opinion anyway."
542283,Fish Farmer,2011-01-22 15:24:00,2234,"Billy go big, 2 is better than 1. especially if you like to fish Erie."
542315,walleyemen,2011-01-22 17:25:00,316,"What fish farmer said, i fish erie lots."
542377,Billy Bob,2011-01-22 19:44:00,5865, YES....it would be used on Lake Erie while drifting for Walleye (yellow pike)...  I'll have to consider two then.
