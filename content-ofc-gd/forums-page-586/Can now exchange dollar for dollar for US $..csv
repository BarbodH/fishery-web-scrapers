539375,irishfield,2011-01-14 18:09:00,26272,  As I originally stated.. I got a $300 cheque (and one for even more at .5% of gross sales).. for every Ontario Corp # that I own. Has nothing to do with personal HST/GST help cheques that people get.. These $300 cheques were sent to every business in Ontario(with no fanfair or announcement) to help offset the costs of upgrading electronics and invoices etc to reflect HST vs Gst and Pst.
539382,Governator,2011-01-14 18:23:00,879,  I have an Ontario Corp # and received it as well.
539662,moemoe,2011-01-15 05:47:00,352,"I am enlightened, I didn't realize the hst scmoozle was written to businesses as well, you can my $300 back in heartbeat to get rid of the tax"
539672,Handlebarz,2011-01-15 10:38:00,3790,For shopping its a good thing but we just lost another 30 drivers here where I work as our company opened another yard in the Detroit area just to save $$$ last year we had over 100 drivers here in Chatham but were at 69 now  a couple years ago we were at 120 in Chatham and around 40 in Barrie/Aliston but they are all gone the rising $$$ sucks to keep us working in Canada the longer it stays high the more jobs head south.

Take it from a guy thats brought hundreds of vehicles over. I will NEVER bring another mercedes across the border.....,mercedes customer service in canada are a bunch of aholes to deal with if you never bought it from a canadian dealer."
541614,dave524,2011-01-20 20:31:00,4508," 135 is the max rating , from test reports I would think 40mph, fine for what I want. Most I've seen have 90's or 115's, the bigger motor was a plus for this listing."

538444,Harrison,2011-01-12 17:19:00,2202,Wish I had the money to invest in some property down south.  Know a few guys that are.  Just a heads up.  Bendix in Toronto is exchanging at par.

Guess I'll close the doors and go on vacation...'till armageddon hits.  Dollar at par won't help our Ontario Manufactures get contracts either..

539296,irishfield,2011-01-14 15:06:00,26272,Is that for personal returns moemoe??.. or business??  I guess when it comes right down to it it will go in the HST refund ledger to offset HST paid out... but either way you look at it.. it becomes income for a business.
539355,moemoe,2011-01-14 17:10:00,352,"The hst cheque is written to individuals not businesses, so I guess this is for your personal income and wouldn't be sent to business ie Irishfield Aviation, Therefore it would not be a claimed expense. I am not a business owner but wouldn't your business claim be separate from your personal or family income tax?"
