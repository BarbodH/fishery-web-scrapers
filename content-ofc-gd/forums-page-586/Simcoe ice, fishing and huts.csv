BRUINEMAN BARRIE EXAMINER  Updated 11:00am Jan 21, 2010   Mark Wanzel photo Jay Munshaw of Grizzly By The Bay Ice Hut Rentals heads onto Lake Simcoe, Thursday, taking with him clients who are looking to experience ice fishing.  Joye Canning hasn't put an ice hut on Kempenfelt Bay in a couple of years, but she still has a handle on winter fishing and ice conditions.  ""The ice this year is very variable,"" says Canning, who still runs a bait and tackle business where fishing licences are also sold across from Minet's Point Park on the south side of Kempenfelt Bay.   She's noticed there haven't yet been any snowmobile-riding visitors coming off the lake, which tells her there's reason for caution. But clearly, the ice fishing season is well underway.  Right along the shore at Minet's Point, Trish Wise and James Phillips run Phillips Hut Rentals. From that point, they rent out 16 huts.  ""Last weekend we were booked solid,"" said a delighted Wise.  The season was slow to come on. Just as the lake trout and whitefish season opened Jan. 1, it rained.  But it quickly cooled down the following day and remained cold. After that, ice quickly formed on the bay.  Wise reports between eight and 10 inches of ice on top of the 80 to 90 feet of water where the Phillips huts are lined into the centre of the bay.  The Weather Network's outlook for the remainder of winter is close to normal for Ontario, possibly slightly colder, separated by moderate spells with the chance of more snow.  Certainly the week-long forecast looks promising for those wanting to venture out onto the ice, particularly this weekend, with temperatures dipping to -14C Saturday and -12C Sunday, accompanied by flurries both days.  A lot of people renting huts come from Toronto and Southern Ontario, but many of the huts booked for the coming weekend are local fishers, said Wise.  This year the Phillips have partnered exclusively with Comfort Inn, providing packages for visitors wanting to spend a couple of days fishing in the comfort of an ice hut by day and relaxing in the hotel overnight.  The cold weather has sparked interest in Lake Simcoe's winter recreational activity, said Pam Bothwright, a tourism development officer with Tourism Barrie.  ""We see a lot of phone calls come in from the States,"" she said.  ""We've definitely seen an increase in phone calls.""  Lake Simcoe is one of Ontario's most popular winter fishing destinations, with ice hut rental operators dotting its shores.  Just south of Barrie, Jay Munshaw helped develop Grizzly By the Bay Fish Hut Rentals.  The newest hut operator is located at Big Bay Point -- where Kempenfelt Bay opens into Lake Simcoe.  ""There's a good eight to 10 inches of black, solid ice where the huts are,"" said Munshaw.  Grizzly started business last year and launched this season with eight huts, with plans to quickly increase the count.  ""They're all brand new huts and their insulated,"" he said.  The largest boasts 144 square feet of space. It is equipped with a kitchen and bathroom and three bunk beds.  The business has been targeting communities all around Ontario, drawing quite a few visitors from the Hamilton and Oshawa areas.  Allen Carriere headed out onto the field of ice that offers a forever view Thursday just to get away from it all and relax. By chance he also caught a fish.  ""The bonus is always catching the fish,"" he said.  ""Once you get one, you get hooked,"" added Munshaw.  mbruineman @ thebarrieexaminer.com  - - -  Preferred ice fishing equipment list:  Fish Finder, bear in mind these are not fish catchers Ice Fishing Shelter Propane heater  Spud bar (for checking ice thickness)  Camera, to verify your tall fishing tales  Ice cleats  Ice Anchoring System Flashlight Lantern  Matches or Lighter, how else are you going to light your heater?
