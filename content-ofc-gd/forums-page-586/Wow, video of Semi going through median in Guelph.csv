542046,splashhopper,2011-01-21 21:09:00,2931,""" yes, holy  "" !   That was close for the guy shooting the video.   And as the report says :  The highway (400) is closed between 8th and 9th Lines until further notice."
542048,spincast,2011-01-21 21:13:00,3279,"wow that is scary close- right through and over the barriers. lucky there was no one to their right, they JUST missed that. Talk about needing Depends I saw another bad one this morning at the 403 and rest acres road -cab of the unit was ripped right  off the frame and the tow truck was recovering when I went by."
542049,Joey,2011-01-21 21:16:00,9122,  I think its Highway 11 not 400 that's closed!
542053,kickingfrog,2011-01-21 21:31:00,8333,Nice piece of driving.  I was watching the transport on the right.
542054,spincast,2011-01-21 21:32:00,3279,Yeah - itshighway 11  My link couple news shots on the right hand side   this is the one I saw this morning - looks like he hit the bridge broadside
542064,GBW,2011-01-21 22:13:00,8460,"oh, I know what he said during that beep... great driving on his part!"
542065,danjang,2011-01-21 22:14:00,148,I would have crapped my pants. Did his windshield break or was that something else?
542066,Grimace,2011-01-21 22:14:00,2020,It is highway 401 at Guelph line.  This is different than the pile up on 11.  Wild video

542109,Shelley Cooper,2011-01-21 23:52:00,394,"This kind of thing IS so scary Joey... I see a lot of it on the northern roads.. sends chill's thro me every time..

542117,Rich Clemens,2011-01-22 00:05:00,3131,Don't think I'd need to go to the bathroom for a month if I say that coming at me.   Geeeez.
542124,Joey,2011-01-22 00:16:00,9122,That's brutal Shelley.  I saw on the news he had a dash cam.  Had it installed after a previous accident that had no witnesses or something like that and wanted it to be there just in case!!
542492,jim,2011-01-23 00:08:00,124," I dunno man, that would get rid of my semi, in a heart beat!!!!"
542501,vinnimon,2011-01-23 00:31:00,2593,"Unbeleivably lucky for the truck/trailer and the camera man. Not for the other.  I remind our drivers on a daily basis, be careful out there. And I ask them about their kids after. 2 thank yous already  Dont ask, it works!"
542510,Jewelbee,2011-01-23 00:53:00,422,"I used to make the drive to Sutton every 2nd weekend. I guess I was lucky never to have a close call like that, Those people had horseshoes up thier"
542692,JohnF,2011-01-23 14:29:00,3494,  Doesn't work that way. You're too busy reacting to be scared. I witnessed exactly the same thing not far from there on the 401 17 years ago. That truck crushed my van. Mine was the first of 11 vehicles to be hit. I was so high on adenalin I felt nothing. I had 4 18 year kids with me.  JF
542701,Dave Bailey,2011-01-23 14:57:00,1641," Quite true, the shakes don't set in until the work is done."
542745,jjcanoe,2011-01-23 16:24:00,744,"I'm really glad I was running a bit early (15 mins ) on friday!  I was pulling into the Guelph service center when it happened, fueled up and hit the hwy again, all I heard on the CB as I was pulling back onto the hwy was Holy Crap!, can't believe that!, did you see that!, etc.....What happened I asked? Big truck just came through the wall past the 312 exit!  took me 15 mins to pull off, fuel both sides and pull back on, so if I was 15 mins slower I hope I would have still missed it! but not by much.... That stretch down the hill was super icy that morning. I came out of Mississauga with an empty trailer and was breaking traction all the way up the escarpment, Started at 101 kmph(what my truck is limited at, at hit the top of the hill at around 65kmph.  Every time I put power to the pedal the wheels would start to break free.... not a salt truck in sight!"
