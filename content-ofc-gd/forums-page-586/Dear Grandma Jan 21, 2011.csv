Its okay if you have to, you had a good life. I’m sure Grandpa is standing there waiting for his wife. Take good care and go in peace. I know you both will be beside me next time I hook into a real big beast...  Love Geoff  I write this in memory of Eleanore Stewart who passed away this evening just after 10:00PM EST"
