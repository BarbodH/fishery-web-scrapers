541737,chris.brock,2011-01-21 01:09:00,4053,"On the way home from work today, on the QEW near Trafalgar, I saw a micro truck, the type you might see in the Carribean, pretty sure it had Ontario plates, couldn't see what manufacturer was, it had a small, 2 person cab and a flat bed (not a box), it was white  anyone know what I saw? I'd be interested in researching them if they are sold in Canada"
541740,Gerritt,2011-01-21 01:16:00,6129,Haldimand motors used to have a ton of em.. I know the type you talking about.. this is what a quick google search turned up..  http://www.alcandistributors.com/index.php?option=com_easygallery&act=categories&cid=29&Itemid=91  G
541744,BUSTER,2011-01-21 01:24:00,1336,"Couple running around here in Guelph, even 4x4,,...I wonder how it does on the trails?"
541747,chris.brock,2011-01-21 01:27:00,4053,"yeah, pretty sure that's it"
541752,bigugli,2011-01-21 01:45:00,6138,"A lot more European vans are showing up here in Canada. Much better suited to the urban landscape than a lot of North American product. Mitsubishi, Daihatsu, Saab, BMC, Suzuki, etc..."
541753,chris.brock,2011-01-21 01:47:00,4053,"I can't find any forsale, what were they going for at Haldiman? They don't have any right now."
541754,daryl0815,2011-01-21 01:49:00,225,"I saw a few of them for sale in Bowmanville a while back, but the guy wanted a ridiculous amount of money for them I think like 8-10 grand, and they were all 1992-95 with about 100,000km on them.  They are right hand drive, and imported from Japan, he had ones made by honda, subaru, and mitsubishi, most of them 4X4 and they looked like fun, but he said that they top out around 80 km/hr so its kind of just a toy, still looks like fun though!     it would make an interesting ice fishing machine!   I found a cool site as well   http://centralminitrucks.com/    Daryl"
541759,Steve_R,2011-01-21 02:03:00,81,Yes l seen a van today like that.l had to look twice lol
541760,BillM,2011-01-21 02:13:00,17367,"Yup, it's definitely Japanese.  A neighbour of mine has a friend that drops by with one every once in a while.  I always do a double take."

541822,Afraz,2011-01-21 09:02:00,250,"They are referred to as Kai class cars in Japan, and they are far from toys.  They are used all over Asia as mini pick ups with actual 4x4's they are put through punishment unimaginable by American trucks. These are work horses for the developing world. They aren't meant to be comfy but they sure as heck are utilitarian, i have seen Cows and bulls put in the back of these lil trucks.  I have seen them loaded with 12 + people (they place a sort of cap on the back - and place bench seats). With a 1.3 Litre gas engine they sip fuel and since they are almost always standard you get lots of low gearing.  Light enough to be lifted by two adults from the back. But string enough to carry 3 times their actual load capacities.  I don't sell these trucks, i actually wanted to import a few had it not been for annoying import laws where these things have to be 90 or older etc etc..  But as some others mentioned the ones sold here often found on kijiji are ridiculously priced often well over 7000 which is simply not worth it. Because they can be purchased brand new for 3000 U.S. in Japan."
541826,pikehunter,2011-01-21 10:30:00,1659,"Seen them around, interesting. Would have a role in an urban invironment but I sure wouldn't want to be in a head on  My brother once drove a cabover transport truck, that was his biggest fear."
541967,SBCregal,2011-01-21 17:56:00,688,theres a guy along plains road in burlington that used to have them.  north side...somewhere past solid gold   not sure if theres any there right now.  ryan
541968,Muskieman,2011-01-21 18:00:00,2472,we have 3 here in Sturgeon... 2 of them have 4 wheeler wheels and tires on them... they go anywhere... right hand drive... apparently very good little machines.
541990,Raf,2011-01-21 18:37:00,3495, wut?  say all you want about domestic vehicles but not too many touch their trucks.  especially not these little poop boxes.  
542135,Gerritt,2011-01-22 01:07:00,6129,JEEP... Just Empty Every Pocket....

542167,bigugli,2011-01-22 02:33:00,6138,A couple of the companies were at the horticulture and farm trade shows a couple of years back. I know a couple of landscape firms that bought units for urban contracts.
542175,irishfield,2011-01-22 02:44:00,26272,Come'on Randy.. I could drive my wifes '64 vette convert thru that dirty water.. .(just because I hate plastic junk!).. but I sure would love that yellow truck above with tracks... if I was living at the lake!
542178,Muskieman,2011-01-22 02:50:00,2472,"True... Wayne.  But for a TOY .. man It's kinda like a four wheeler .. but it has a cab and heat ...  You'd never see me with that thing at the drive in.  Yep .. that Yellow one looks pretty good... I'd put a plow on it and attach a few pool noodles to keep it a float .. just in case.  Useless, but yet.. Useful  I wouldn't want to hit one with my Expedition."
542238,Jewelbee,2011-01-22 09:26:00,422,"Don't know what it's called or who makes it, but I see them all the time down here in the fruit belt. They are used on the farms for carrying the workers and product to and from the orchards."
