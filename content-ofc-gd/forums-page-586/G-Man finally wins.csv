542702,The Urban Fisherman,2011-01-23 14:57:00,2050," Yeah it's fishing news, but people always post on the main forum about how much the leafs suck and nobody says anything about that so I don't see a problem with somebody posting the results of a Fishing tournament on the main discussion page of this wonderful fishing forum!  Good for G - he deserves it, and now he can swing for the fences the rest of the season because he's in the classic no matter what!  Cheers, Ryan"
