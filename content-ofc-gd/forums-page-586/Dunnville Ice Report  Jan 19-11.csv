541433,T Fisher,2011-01-19 23:47:00,139, Nice report thanks fishmaster. I've been to Dunville many time to vist family but never fished the big lake.  Can you steer me in a general direction of where your fishing? I'm heading down on Saturday for a birthday.  Question for you what's the story with the big catfish mount?
