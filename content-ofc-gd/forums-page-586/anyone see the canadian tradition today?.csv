For some reason  the name Scuba Steve popped into my head. Then they called him Steve, what a coincidence? Then it hit me, i think he used to be here on OFC, way back when (or maybe still is). His name was Steve and he had a BIG black bushy moustache. Ring a bell to anyone?  Anyway not sure, but if he is, I thought some older members might be interested."

542347,walleyejigger,2011-01-22 18:42:00,876,Yes. Looked like this man. Could it be? Don't know him myself so was just going by looks.
542500,Ron,2011-01-23 00:28:00,1683,Here is another picture of him. Anyone remember the card in the background?   
542667,Spiel,2011-01-23 12:39:00,9065,"Yes, it was Crappiesteve. He's been working as a guide up there for a few years now."
