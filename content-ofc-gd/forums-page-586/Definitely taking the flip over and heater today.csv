541844,limeyangler,2011-01-21 12:51:00,5204,"I guess you could say we're making ice here at the moment, i'm gonna go trout fishing in 2 hours to celebrate!   MY THERMOMETER THIS MORNING......BRRRRRRRRRRR.     Well....dunno if it was wise but for some reason my urge to trout fish was slowly overtaken by the urge to harras some walters. Tossed a coin and fate decided the trout would wait.  Turned out i'd have to wait on the walters too.....lost one at the hole right at the end that was it....loads of fish on screen for the whole 3 hours i was there...lookers....no takers.  Shack was nice and warm....left the lake in a near whiteout...wind really picked up...must've been touching -50C with the wind chill.....and thank god for heated grips on my snowmachine!"
541845,Spiel,2011-01-21 12:55:00,9065,"That's too cold, hell my beer would freeze.  But you go right ahead and have a great day Simon!"
541847,Old Man,2011-01-21 13:01:00,822,I'm staying put in my permanent shack today with a big pile of fire wood.
541856,limeyangler,2011-01-21 13:39:00,5204, Sure you dont want to meet at the twin towers at 10am.....hit Thunder?
541861,Old Man,2011-01-21 13:49:00,822, The wife want's to do some walleye fishing today. I'm going to head down and get a fire going in the shack.
541868,Blue Lk,2011-01-21 14:02:00,337,"-35 in Eagle River too,u gotta be nuts,Simon. Have a GR8 day."
541874,Rod Caster,2011-01-21 14:20:00,5784,Son of a pike that's cold.
541883,limeyangler,2011-01-21 14:45:00,5204,"I'll have to head down that way soon so i know where you guys are at, i'd drop by and say hi today but i'm on a time limit, curse you night shifts! Anyway....see ya Tuesday, cant wait to try that lake...it was on my ""new Lake"" list for this year.   I'm fighting common sense as hard as i can Rick!    Did you know that in Turkey to call someone a ""son of a donkey"" (Eshek oglu eshek)is highly offensive...but i guess 'Pike"" is ok."
541919,Old Man,2011-01-21 15:55:00,822,Hopefully it's as good as last year. See you Tuesday.
541934,troutologist,2011-01-21 16:16:00,951,"Yup its brisk out there today, but it looks like sunday and into next week we're getting a reprieve....minus single digits!  Good luck today!"
541970,lew,2011-01-21 18:02:00,12766,"Good onya for getting out fishing in those temps Simon.  We had -32 down here last week and although it wasn't a record it was pretty darned close to it.  My dad grew up in Saskatchewan where -30 to -40 were/are somewhat the norm but he always said it wasn't bad cause it was a dry cold. I dunno, but -40 is pretty darned cold no matter how you slice it"
541972,kickingfrog,2011-01-21 18:07:00,8333,At minus forty you only need one scale.
541983,lew,2011-01-21 18:25:00,12766," And no matter which one you use Rob, you still freeze yer butt off"
541987,Roy,2011-01-21 18:30:00,13728,Yeah but it's a DRY cold. Just sayin'.
