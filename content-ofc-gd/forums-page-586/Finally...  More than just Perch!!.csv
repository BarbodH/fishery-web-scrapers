We didn't mark much in the way of white fish schools.  the odd loner cruising through.  Lots of perch.  I decided to take a coffee break.  So I sat my rod down, and poured a cup.  Halfway through my cup of joe, I notice a single whitie on bottom.  Put down the cup down.  Jig jig.... Bang.  Gotta love it.    Here's my rig, with the new Strikemaster..     Here's a shot of last weekend.  My sled hasn't run right since.  Engine compartment is full of snow..    Made for a nice photo though!    It was a cold day on the ice.  But worth it.  Good luck to anyone out there this weekend!"

542557,Nipfisher,2011-01-23 02:16:00,2449,"Way to go Nick. Is that a Bravo ""Trapper"". Nice light sled that isn't fast but works hard."
542619,NAW,2011-01-23 04:01:00,4022," Good eye.  It's actually an bravo Transporter, short track.  I just build a storage box for the back, so it looks like a trapper.  I wish it was a trapper!  Good working sled, until you fill the engine compartment with snow, then.. Not so much.."
