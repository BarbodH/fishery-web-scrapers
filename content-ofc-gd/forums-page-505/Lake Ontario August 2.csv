With in 5 mins of having the lines in the water we had one on for a quick second but was gone before we got it out of the rod holder. About a half hour 45 mins went on with out any action then the rod starts going, I jump up grab it and the fights starts. The best fight I have had from a bow and it was awesome took a few good runs and finally got it to the boat and netted him. We measured him quick got a quick pic and back he went to swim another day.  My PB bow 11.5 lbs and 33"" 3/4 inches   So we get the lines back in and then not long after that we get another one well this time it's my friends turn. It was by far the best acrobatic show I have seen yet from a bow none stop jumping and some big leaps he jumped a good 4 feet clear out of the water if not more and then we landed him got a quick pic and back in he went. Then we went for at least an hour and had no action, switched up a few thing and with in a few minutes fish on. I grabbed the rod and start reeling it wasn't a huge one but a decent one get it right up beside the boat and I realized it was my first salmon that I was going to land, so I thought my buddy grabs the net goes to get the fish and the fish bolts down and back up and gone spit the lure out right beside the boat lol. Oh well I'll get one eventually. We went one to get a bunch of hits setting the dipsy but no takers. We did have one hit real hard you could her the rod just smack real hard and it was gone reled in to find it snapped the leader from the dipsy to the lure. After that my buddy went on to get his pb bow and it was a 8.5lbs bow and about 27 inches. After that we had no action at all so called it a day around 1:30pm. All in all it was a good day on the water, sure beats the heck out of sitting on the couch.  Thanks for reading, hope you enjoy."

608798,Live2fish85,2011-08-03 01:04:00,1633,Thanks alot guys. I appreciate it.  Frankie65 your right I said the same thing when I got him in lol. Thought if this had the girth that my 27 inch just shy of 10lbs it would have been a real nice one but none the less still better then the other.  Spincast thanks. I am still fairly new to the salmon/rainbow trolling mostly rainbow lol. But when I get out next with my friend I will keep that in mind and try it out for sure.  Thanks again guys.  Chris

608834,Gregoire,2011-08-03 03:06:00,1397,Congrats on the PB. I second easing off on the drag. When using Dipsy's your drag should be as loose as it can be...you may have to play with it to get it just right.
608914,Live2fish85,2011-08-03 15:14:00,1633,Thanks Joey and Fishgreg. I will be loosening the drag next time we go out. Hopefully I will actually land my first salmon to lol.
608917,adolson,2011-08-03 15:20:00,783,Congrats!
608942,Leecher,2011-08-03 16:39:00,7832,Nice bow!!!  Congrats
608945,Gregoire,2011-08-03 16:46:00,1397,also if you are having trouble getting the drag set properly try adjusting the spool tension instead of the drag.
608949,Live2fish85,2011-08-03 17:05:00,1633,Thanks guys and fishgreg thanks I wouldnt have thought of that so I will keep that in mind. I am hoping to get out soon again.
