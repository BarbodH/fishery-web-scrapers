608727,Jer,2011-08-02 21:52:00,1426,Ennismore Inn & Resort closed and was sold a few (or more) years ago. It is now a some of kind teen leadership training centre.

I don't think that the new owner followed Gary and Judy's advice on doing the show circuit in the states to keep it full. I get saddened everytime I go by the place in my boat. It used to be a hopping place full of tourists that had visited for generations."
609090,Jer,2011-08-04 10:44:00,1426,"The guy who bought the property from Gary & Judy was originally gonna subdivide the property and build houses. He ran the resort into the ground for a couple of seasons and is now leasing it out to the teen leadership people. How much it gets used I don't know, I usually only pass by at the end of the road, there is a nice new shiny sign.  It's a shame really, as Jimmer said, the place used to be hopping, full of fishermen from as far as Colorado."
609153,adempsey,2011-08-04 15:30:00,1498,"Yes, the new owner made a BIG mistake.  That lodge had a great reputation and what appeared to be a relatively large American client base.  It's too bad.  I rented a boat from there after the new owner took over several years ago, and wow, what a mess.  I guess he just got in over his head.  I imagine it's probably going to be up for sale again in the near future."
609407,jimmer,2011-08-05 14:13:00,2730,"It would be nice if a new owner took over, but that place is worth over a million bucks and with tourism being a tough go, it's hard to sell something like that. It might eventually go to a developer."
