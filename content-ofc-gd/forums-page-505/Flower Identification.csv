609151,jimmer,2011-08-04 15:24:00,2730,That is an invisible flower in my books!
609152,GreenCanada,2011-08-04 15:28:00,375,"  Haha, good call!  I'm in the process of getting the photo up, I thought I could using my blackberry but turns out I can't!  lol"

609156,John,2011-08-04 15:36:00,2956, E Send it to Photobucket and post it from there...
609157,SmokestackLightnin,2011-08-04 15:44:00,390,It's a Gaillardia or Arizona Sun or Blanket Flower
609159,John,2011-08-04 15:47:00,2956,Could be a Zinnia or hybrid Chrysanthemum?
609174,GreenCanada,2011-08-04 16:18:00,375,"Wow! Thanks for the responses. I definitely believe it is a yellow flame zinnia, though, SmokestackLightnin had a good suggestion. The only real big difference was the number and style of petals.  Thanks again, that helped a lot!"
609205,HTHM,2011-08-04 17:22:00,4082,Zinnia here is a link to more info: http://www.galagarden.com/the-year-of-the-zinnia.html
609297,bigugli,2011-08-04 23:20:00,6138,Not enough pink in the petals to be Gaillardia grandiflora/ Arizona Sun. Not sure of the specific variety but looks to be some form of Zinnia subvariant. The actual flavour escapes  me.
