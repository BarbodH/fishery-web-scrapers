608207,ehg,2011-08-01 02:13:00,2666,A 50 incher is a rare feat but more so in the Kawarthas. After about 25 yrs. i am still searching for a 50 incher on Pigeon maybe i need to know where this D.S.I is located?  Nice going there Crazyhook.
609021,Cynosure,2011-08-04 00:03:00,2,Nice Muskie Jamie. You will have to show me where DSI is this summer.
609098,grimsbylander,2011-08-04 12:08:00,3016,"Wow! What a beautiful fish...you must still be smiling.  I HAVE to go and target muskie soon. After 20+ years of fishing bass and walleye I hate to admit it but I've never caught a muskie. Yep, never. I see a fish like that and I think it's time I get some basic muskie tackle and lake tips from some of the masters on the forum.  Congrats again.  Dave"
