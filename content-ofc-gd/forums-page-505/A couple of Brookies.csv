Like most of the country, it's been hot hot hot up here as well and finding suitable water temps for Brookies was nearly impossible. Between 3 boats we landed about 20 Brook Trout for the weekend. Biggest was a 24"" girthy male that probably went 6 lbs. Unfortunately it wasn't caught in my boat and I don't have pics of that one.  Here's a couple of my best fish for the weekend. 20"" and 21 1/2"". The 21 1/2"" fish was spitting up smelts like crazy at boatside during the fight.      Check out the photo section for some scenery shots from the weekend as well."

608487,BillM,2011-08-02 00:55:00,17367,Awesome fish Dan!  Let's hope those temps drop over the next couple of weeks.

608617,Rod Caster,2011-08-02 14:48:00,5784,Picture perfect fish. Brookies that size are hard or maybe impossible to come by in our area anymore.

609296,danc,2011-08-04 23:15:00,4677," lol Ron. If anything, I'm planning a trip the week after labor day weekend. I just started a new job with a new company so I don't know if I can swing the time off so early. With any luck I'll get to taste one of your world famous ceasars sometime late this summer one way or another. Cheers Bud."
