608544,pikeguy,2011-08-02 02:42:00,195,"Went out fishing to day and Shorty got snagged. when i came to help her i took the rod and gave it a wank  and SNAP it went. Now to replace it, It was a Berkley select, the pulse med/hev 6' spinning rod one piece since they do not make these any more i'm looking for some opinions on the same style rod that would be similar.and with a full cork handel."
608546,Joey,2011-08-02 02:46:00,9122,Get Spiel to make you one
608550,BillM,2011-08-02 02:57:00,17367,6'6 2pc Shimano Clarus should fit the bill.
608557,irishfield,2011-08-02 04:31:00,26272,Just give her your rod and I'm sure she'll be happy !
608588,corvette1,2011-08-02 12:16:00,1765,play with your own rod and go buy shorty a new one
608602,Roy,2011-08-02 13:27:00,13728,"Don't get her a 2 piece. You already did that to her one piece and she didn't like it. Get her a St. Croix Premier PS60MF. It's the only 6', one piece, medium rod with a full cork handle at a reasonable price. My first choice for her would have been a Compre but they now all have split grips that she might not like. Oh and in the future, let her get her own snags out."
608605,Shorty,2011-08-02 13:46:00,16,    He tried to give me his - I don't want it... I don't like it!
