605903,Joeytier,2011-07-24 23:53:00,3990,"Looks awesome, aside from the lack of weight."
605923,ChrisK,2011-07-25 01:49:00,2772,Its a good start Curtis. Now you just got to feed it some steroids and show us the end results. Have a good look around at this link and it will give you the jist of what your shootin for... http://www.grimreaperlures.com/about.htm
606352,Curtis,2011-07-26 13:03:00,83,the weights behind the tail bud thats why u cant see it.. there is an oz n a half bell sinker infront of the hook>>>
606353,Curtis,2011-07-26 13:04:00,83,  This got enough blades for ya   I shud have added something to show size of the first bait that last blade is about a size 12/14 thats why there is only two on the bait
606578,ChrisK,2011-07-27 02:14:00,2772,Gettin there Curtis. Can you put a couple of willow leaf blades on the last two and leave the rest of the colorado blades. That will give it some serious thump. Also run silver beads up the wire to the eyelet to give it even more bling....
608920,Curtis,2011-08-03 15:34:00,83,Heres a bucktail for yal to check out just finished it for a customer..    Sorry for the poor quality pic it will get larger if u click just a bit pixelled
