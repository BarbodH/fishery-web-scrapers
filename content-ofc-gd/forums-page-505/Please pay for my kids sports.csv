All through growing up I did farm work to pay for my sports.  Worked on turkey farms, pig farms, picked apples at an orchard. Best gig I ever had though was liming & raking the diamonds and putting the bases out for baseball games at our school where the house league teams played. That was easy money compared to some of the farm chores I did. I learned alot of skills and work ethic doing all these things and I am thankful for it.  40 years from now I can't imagine those boys out in front of the LCBO this past weekend will be looking back on the experience and thinking "" Boy am I glad my folks made me do that cause I'm a better man for it"".  Oh and I played junior as well. It was SWEEEEEET. They paid everything...even my skate sharpening  :thumbsup_anim:"

I then asked where they were from and said they were from Mississauga and not Oakville so I said good luck but did not contribute to their cause but I would not have donated even if the girls were from Oakville since that type of fundraising is something I do not agree with.......

My other son will play here AAA and in a loop in western NY called the boys of summer, we figure conservative 4000 Ball costs us out of pocket 12k plus we figure an additional 3k in hidden expenses and 10k in lost income opportunities BETTER THEN SITTING BEHIND A PLAZA SMOKING POT, PLAYING X BOX ALL DAY AND HAVING THE ODD SMOKE if thats the cost we as parents make to teach them team play physically challenge themselves learn ethtics and a sport Im ok with that, so when you see amateur sports asking for a donation in part you are subsidizing thier play and maybe keeping a kid out of trouble, do we really need the 5 bucks we would donate?  The big caviate offered these days is scholerships, and for a good athelete and poor student its an opportunity, many of the baseball ones sadly are to junior CO's and amount to nadda, unless your a stud.  For us its about playing at a competative level where the boys are challanged, we dont have the visions of the pro's although it was seriously nice to have a dialogue about my kid from an ohio state buckeye recruiter and one from miami and Penn."

Nobody is giving me toonies or loonies to buy diapers and formula for him... So why the heck  should I donate to unessasary sports...  The big problem is parent that are in denial about their kids skills... They all think their son is the next Crosby... They probably aren't... Put your kids in house league... They learn about teamwork... You don't travel... They get exercise... And have fun... And it's a fraction if the cost... What some people spend on their kids athletics in their lifetime would be a retirement fund for some people...  Makes me sick to think the kid got to play aaa hockey for 10 years but as for university... Well sorry son... We spent all our money on hockey ...

Its not about the ""free "" education as those generally dont exist, you really need to be a stud to go there.  What it is is in most cases a parent wanting to see the child succeed, once making an advanced team the rose glasses usually come off and they want and the kids want to play at a more competative level, after all who wants a kid pitching 90 in house league.."
608657,GreenCanada,2011-08-02 17:25:00,375,"  I played a variety of sports growing up, with most of them being Rep level while a couple were just house league. I learned how to function effectively as a member of a team, I learned how to communicate better, but the one thing I didn't learn from sports was ethics. I learned what is right and wrong from my parents. I often learned ways to ""get around the rules"" from my coaches and the ridiculous parents (not all) that sometimes were ""overzealous"" in their screaming and support of their child. Oh, and I noticed that you said a sport you were ok with... What if your child had preferred another sport that you didn't enjoy? Would you force your child to go into that sport?  My last comment is this. If I have a couple extra bucks I'll give it to someone who I feel is deserving. Oh, and I would have definitely said something to the parents sitting idly while their children panhandled in front of a store."

On the other side of this debate, I grew up in a family of five....yes FIVE boys and we all played hockey. Single income...Dad was a plummer, mom was a stay at home housewife. Christmas, and birthdays were tight but we made it work because it was important to us.  on a 3rd side...I also Coached hockey for 6 years, We ALWAYS made the parents aware that when it came to travel or equipment needs there was a fund made available through the city league to help underprivilaged familys, and that I would personally set them up if they needed to apply for it. We always fundraised with the usual chocolate bars, and cookies to compensate for tourney costs.... only once did I ever have a parent need assistance, and they recieved it. I imagine most city leagues have a similar releif fund...the coaches and parents just need to do a bit of research.  My point being this...  A trip to Cuba??? Gimmee a break"

But I totally see where you are coming from CPH.  I played competitive sports, my parents couldn't afford it so I started working at Burger King at the ripe age of 13.  Saved my sheckles and I could buy a new stick or used pair of skates when I needed it.  I remember when my skates, gloves, helmet and pants were supplied for me, I felt like I won the lottery.  Before Junior our coaches organized many bottle drives, car washes, auctions, BBQs to help raise funds for extra practice ice and tournaments.  We busted our humps off the ice as much as on the ice to become better players.  My Nephew is a natural talent, playing AAA hockey at 9, and it costs my brother a fortune. I went to one practice and was blown away with the core skills these kids are taught nowadays.  They are learning stuff I didn't in AAA until I was 12.  I am coaching my 5 yr old in hockey next year, looking forward to it."
608918,DanD,2011-08-03 15:23:00,2223,"I don’t like it either but the panhandling is going on a lot more these days because some of the other means of raising money have been taken away. Or the kids are not being supported by the parents; as in helping in a supervisory position, of a fund raising event; some parents are using the team(s) as a baby sitting service. Here are a couple of examples I’ve run into. I ran a Sunoco gas station for approx 20 years, at a fairly busy intersection here in London. I always allowed one group or other too hold car washes on the weekends, on my lot. That was until the city came in and told me we were no longer allowed; I thought here we go; I’ll need to get a permit for these kids to wash a few cars. As it turned out it wasn’t them groping for a permit fee; it was to stop a commercial place of business from allowing soapy water to enter the storm sewers. That was the end of washing cars outside the shop and the liability on my part of allowing the cars inside to be washed was way too high. As for the lack of support from parents; I went too the coaches of the two soccer teams I sponsor and asked if they were willing to deliver advertizing flyers for my shop. That I would pay the team eight cents a copy and there would be 5000 copies. Plus if it worked out I would ask them for a second 5000 at a later date. Neither of the coaches could get enough parents to volunteer as supervisors to get this done; so panhandling it is????  Dan."
608921,blarg,2011-08-03 15:38:00,289,"  This is exactly right,  and I feel that it is this type of attitude that has lead to kids sports becoming more and more organized and more expensive ehich ultimately only excludes the kids of parents who don't have money to burn.  It was getting like this 20 years ago, I can only imagine what it is like now, my kids played soccer, now they do a lot of swimming, close to home and cheap."
608922,NAW,2011-08-03 15:47:00,4022,"I don't give money to anyone, for any reason.  I give my time and effort to my community in several ways.  I take time off work to search for lost people all over Ontario, that's a enough lost money for me.  Probably gave up a few grand last year.  When ever people ask me for donations, I politely decline.  If all of these kids begging for money went out a got part time jobs, they would make a lot more money in the long run."
608928,adolson,2011-08-03 16:07:00,783,"Like Mike, I lost my job and couldn't find one for about 5 months and was planning to move cities in hopes of finding work. Nobody gave me a cent - not even my own parents. All I got was EI, which came too late to really help and I paid into to begin with.  The parents and coaches should be organizing fundraisers to - gosh - fund this kind of thing, if they have to do it.  Wash my car - it costs what, a penny per car? I'll pay for that. Cut my lawn - that costs you nothing, I've got a lawnmower you can use. I'll pay for that. Shovel my driveway in the winter - I've got shovels you can use. I'll pay for that.  Begging is not fundraising. This is teaching these kids that the world owes them something, when it's actually the opposite."

I have grandkids playing AAA and AA (not goalies) and they are outfitted very well for $500 a season. It's a little like fishing really, a $500 rod and $300 reel doesn't generally catch more fish than a $100 combo. I have seen kids (10-12 year olds) with more talent then my grandkids playing AAA in used skates and hand-me-down pads 'cause that's all that their parents can afford...................you know what, they can skate circles around most kids in that ""cheap"" equipment.  It's not fundraising that I have a problem with Brian it's the panhandling outside the store while their well dressed parents look on and sneer if you choose not to shell out to their kids, for nothing, who could care less about being there.........."

So when kids approach me for baseball or football I always buy the candy bar or two and then give it back to the kid for him to eat.....but not soccer since I don't consider it a real sport and don't support it.  Bob
608085,Familyfisherman,2011-07-31 17:35:00,188,"I played ""AAA"" hockey all through and rep baseball and lacrosse, etc -- did TONNES of fundraising.  We did bottle drives, and a huge garage sale, but never sold almonds or cheese or any of that.  The best thing we ever did was work the local bingo parlour -- kids had to go around bringing cards and dabbers, drinks, whatever -- our entire team did it for 3 months, and we raised $10k MORE than we needed to go to Europe.  Happy to give if people are earning the money.  But don't like to give when they just ask for it so their (often) spoiled kids just get to go to a few more tournaments that they don't appreciate or get fancy coats and matching pants to wear so they can make fun of kids who don't get such things.  Kids today are terribly spoiled for the most part in my opinion -- they get far too much -- I don't think it'll end well.  My 2 cents."

It was always with the express understanding that the kids  earn their way and take ownership of a special event. In scouting, we fundraised heavily so that 25 youth and leaders could spend 4 days in Ottawa to participate in Remembrance week. The local Lions Club ( their sponsors ) agreed to cover the cost of a chartered school bus. The rest of the funds came from 2+ tons of recycled aluminum cans. My home looked like a mini scrap yard. With funds left over they also purchased tents and chartered 2 buses for a day trip to the Science Centre. They earned and deserved the rewards, and learned some valuable lessons.

We never thought in our wildest dreams when she started in the sport at 5 years old would she stick with or be as accomplished as she is.  Our family has had to make some pretyy serious financial adjustments to help her realize her fullest potential in this sport.  The club does fundraisers, prizes, raffles, car washes.... all of it.  The families with more money particpate equally in the fundraisers and don;t come across with holier than thou attitudes just because they drive expensive vehicles and live in big homes. They are in it for ALL of the kids in the club.  A child that may not come from a privileged family should not limit that kids chances to achieve their best.  My childs success in her sport is not your financial burden. But if a kid is standing out there asking for some help, maybe step back a moment and think about THEM, instead of what you think their parents "" parenting style"" should be.  There are many stories in the sports arena's of how  kids worked their tails off to get to where they are.  And there are just as many stories of what the parents go through to help their child, no matter what it costs their Pride and Ego.  I can say this, my daughter has just qualified to go to Russia to represent the Junior Canadian Taekwondo team and I will be doing whateve I have to do to help her get there.  She is doing her part with straight A's and volunteering in school etc.  I can suck up some FALSE pride  and do my part.   As for the comment that the kids are arriving at the liquor store in their parents $50 k vehicles.  Rememebr this, not EVERY SINGLE KID there is.  Not mine. And how do you know which one of those kids is in the same boat as mine?  Count your blessings if you have a privileged lifestyle. And count your blessings even more when you help that one kid realize their dream because you decided to drop a WHOLE LOONEY in the basket while walking in to the liquor store to buy your fourty dollar bottle."

It was needing an infusion of funding to carry on. We virtually had nothing. No tents or equipment or a place to gather. So to keep the young fellows busy we built a canoe and raffled it off. It was a great way to teach them some skills and make a few bucks in the process. We earned enough to keep us going for three years. The next year we built a motorized go-kart.

And a group of parents chatting 10 feet away keeping an eye on things I guess.  Maybe it's just me but it really rubbed me the wrong way. I did my share of selling tickets,chocolate covered almonds, casino nights etc etc for my sons sports, but any team he was on never asked for money without something for the donator in return. And to top it off making the poor kids beg in front of the LCBO on a beautiful summer long weekend when they should be out enjoying the long weekend with them.

607879,cram,2011-07-30 15:22:00,1733,"I don't mind that stuff, and without chocolate bars/almonds whatever WAY more of the $$ actually goes to their cause."
607880,landry,2011-07-30 15:27:00,1005,"I never donate money to middle class Canadians to ""support"" them as they drive their son to sports games in their 50,000$ SUV with 700$ of hockey equip in the back. I give to real charities. I refuse to do team fundraisers for my kids hockey - I just throw in $ instead - I am too embarrassed to ask for $$$ to support my family's lifestyle choices. Landry"
607882,Gregoire,2011-07-30 15:34:00,1397,"Being a coach I understand how hard it can be to pay for everything, and see why someone may take the easy way out when looking for fundraising. However, I agree that kids should have to work for the money. It may create more work for me as well in terms of coordinating delivery, tracking money and inventory, but the lessons learned are worth it. Personally I would not just donate money to a sports organization. Donating to a charity is a different story."
607885,Roy,2011-07-30 15:45:00,13728, Good luck with that. I got lambasted 2 years ago for saying the same thing.
607892,crappieperchhunter,2011-07-30 15:58:00,2582, I agree 100%   I wouldn't be in the kitchen here flipping burgers if I couldn't take the heat Roy
607899,John,2011-07-30 16:51:00,2956,"I coached competitive soccer for 15 years and we fund raised for everything other than basic registration. It involved sponsorship in return for advertising on uniforms etc., running bingo's in smoke filled rooms at midnight to 3.00am, car washes, bottle drives, garage sales.........you get the idea.  My Grandson plays competitive hockey, (very expensive), they are not allowed to fund raise at all, I guess different clubs look at it in different ways.  I just can't figure clubs, coaches and parents allowing players to scrounge money outside liquor stores, beer stores and grocery stores without offering anything or any effort in return, to me it's a form of panhandling......just my .002!"
607902,smally21,2011-07-30 17:02:00,993,"a dude at work is always selling stuff for his kids rep hockey team. fundraiser for a week long trip to florida. a weekend in new york city. these 9 year olds have matching track suits to wear on the bus to the game. each one has a custom embroidered hockey bag with name and number  - i helped him pick them up they were over 200$ each. they have mmore custom bling than an NBA franchise. they are 9 years old.  all these kids live in half million dollar homes and go to school in  navigators and lexus suvs.  around here you are not sending inner city kids to camp, you are sponsoring jackets and bling to go to expensive tournaments and stay for a week at fancy hotels with giant swimming pools.  im with ya. lets get blasted together.  if a homeless guy with a coffee cup stands in front of the LCBO he is guilty of a crime called panhandling and subject to arrest or at least given the boot for tresspassing. maybe the homeless guy should get himself a baseball uniform....."
607906,Carp,2011-07-30 17:43:00,1488,"CPH, I agree with your thinking on the subject. There should be something in return for people's money.  My daughter is on a rep hockey team this coming season. It will cost about 10 times what house league hockey would have cost. One of the dads is a doctor, but most of the parents have average incomes. To offset the financial burden for some of the player's families, the team is selling tickets for a draw. Prize is $1500. They're calling it ""Beer for a Year"", but the prize can be spent anywhere. For some on this board, it would be more like ""beer for a week""."
607909,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2011-07-30 18:05:00,0,talk about a bunch of fuddy duddies.  hockey (or any sport really) can cost a family 15000 a year and without this fundraising many simply wouldn't be there.  i'm very glad that there was fundraising when i played hockey as it wasn't something that was easy for my single mother to afford growing up.  want something in return?  how about the knowledge that you're helping out a kid and there might be a few kids on that team too poor to afford what others take for granted.
607910,ketchenany,2011-07-30 18:08:00,3229,Didn't you get asked for a donation by the cashier when checking out your purchase? What is that all about.  I tell them to lower the taxes and I may.
607911,Skud,2011-07-30 18:14:00,739,I have no problem donating money for kids to play sports here in Ontario. They can spend their own money to fly and play in Cuba.
607915,Gregoire,2011-07-30 18:52:00,1397," I don't think that the general feeling is not to donate to kids sports, rather it is that if they want to fundraise they shouldn't just sit outside a business and ask for it; they should do some type of fundraising. In my experience there are many things that an organization can do to raise a decent amount of  money. The sad part is that it is probably the parents who are too lazy to organize it so they just decided to ask for handouts. I take issue with the lesson that this type of request teaches our young people. As was pointed out a lot of this stuff is not for essential things, but rather for luxuries, like matching track suits, or numerous tournaments. I would sooner buy a kid a pari of skates that give them money outside a LCBO so that they can buy a team tracksuit. I could go on a longer rant right now, but I will just end with the fact that sometimes it seems that kids are most interested in how good they look, rather than how well they play."
607919,John,2011-07-30 19:22:00,2956," No fuddy duddy here, just asking for some effort for the reward, that's all. Don't expect me when I am headed into the grocery store to drop money into the hands of a few kids yawning away at the entrance with their parents sat under an umbrella drinking lemonade! By the way these are usually soccer teams or gymnastic clubs looking for funds to buy fancy track suits or offset a trip to Texas to play a tournament, not kids who can't afford to play........sorry......  Not sure where you get your numbers but $15k is not it. Rep hockey one of the more expensive kids sports here in Burlington costs about $2,000 for registration, jerseys, ice time, refs, etc, etc.....Tournaments can add up to another $2-3,000 depending on the distance. Equipment around $500. It's cheaper in other cities like Oakville for example as they are allowed to fund raise and accept team sponsorship from affluent Mom's and Dad's.  As a rep club, if the kid is talented enough and the parent(s) can not afford it there are sponsored players. If the kid wants to play hockey (house league) and parent(s) can't afford it there are many programs offered to allow the child to play either free or partially sponsored.  Just sayin'."
607921,irishfield,2011-07-30 19:27:00,26272,"I've never seen winternet go right through the summer! I thought I was the only one not getting out fishing, but I see that ain't so...  I'm no stranger to helping out those in need, but at some point they have to find their own dignity ! Many seem to have none left!  As for the LCBO check out.. would you like to donate $2 to ......... I have a burr about that, as they won't allow the Crohn's and Colitis foundation of Canada to get in on that windfall. I still however gladly cough up $2 if they say ""Sick Kids""... and I hate to say it but that's been a lot of toonies over the last 2 years!"
607927,John,2011-07-30 20:29:00,2956," Yup, we have donated a lot of loonies and toonies to great causes at the liquor store too..........."
607929,misfish,2011-07-30 20:46:00,29133,"  That was the cost of just my sons last chest protector John.   Betty and I were both middle class workers and my son was playing AA and AAA as a goalie.The last pair of pads I bought him were 1200 bucks.  We fund raised,draw tickets,the circus would come to town and give a percentage to the team for selling tickets.  Now I see the kids at the beer store collecting donations and empties. Nothing for it,but you know what,they could be doing worse things and have no issues with leaving them my empties. It,s not a cheap sport. Hockey that is.   The one year,he got to go and play in Denver, at the army base."
607933,crappieperchhunter,2011-07-30 21:01:00,2582," I never had an issue with fund raising. It's the ""panhandling"" outside the LCBO that I take offense with.  And perhaps I am a fuddy duddy for expecting some form of a thank you with regards to giving my $$$ to a total stranger to help support there extra curricular activities. I can live with that."
607949,Dontcryformejanhrdina,2011-07-30 23:00:00,535,"  I agree 100%. To take it a step further, I hate when some amateur athletes in Canada complain about lack of funding from the government, and I've seen stories about these poor, poor athletes who actually have to work real jobs in order to pay to go skiiing or whatever. Oh no! Heaven forbid adults have to support their own hobbies. I don't ask anyone to buy me new fishing gear to support my dreams. Kids are one thing, adults are even worse.  Also, I'm not going to feel sorry for any kids who can't afford to play hockey. There are bigger tragedies in life.  Charity is good. Spoiling people with something they absolutely don't NEED is something different."
607952,fishinmortician,2011-07-30 23:29:00,100,"Im sure we could round up 9 Cubans and save them the trip.  Baseballs baseball.  I played rep all through ball and never did we travel outside of Ontario.  Pay for our kids to go to Cuba...... well mom and dad drink umbrella drinks for a week.  My parents would even stop at McDonald's on the odd trip, sounds like the Dr. would stop at Red Lobster with the team after every game.  My opinion, get off your butts and earn it!!"
607968,RyanT,2011-07-31 00:23:00,72,Have had the exact same thing happen here at the local Ottawa liquor/ store.  I don't donate for things like trips to Cuba when there's homeless guys begging for change right bedside the kids in their team's uniforms.
607969,RyanT,2011-07-31 00:25:00,72, x2  Well said!   
607970,RyanT,2011-07-31 00:30:00,72,   They don't need to go take a trip to Cuba to play baseball then... that's excessive.
608062,Musky or Specks,2011-07-31 14:10:00,2710,My son was an elite travel baseball player from 16 to 18 yrs old Base cost $7500. My choice to pay it. So yes sports can be expensive. I can't imagine what the same type of program for hockey might cost. But panhandling just doesn't cut it. Car Wash is very little dollar layout and heck whenever I see kids doing it I always give them a couple of bucks without getting my car washed because they are trying to pay their own way.
