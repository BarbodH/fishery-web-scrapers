604062,Fisherman,2011-07-18 20:13:00,7201,"I've got an older galvanized rim with about the same runout, that was done free for me at XXX Tire Shop on Anne St in Barrie, couple of numbnutz that couldn't mount new rubber on the rim and seat the bead without warping the rim on the machine.  Try to prove that.  You can get a good idea of the runout by slowly spinning the rim, with or without rubber on the hub.  Place a piece of 4x4 or brick on its side beside the tire with two thin rulers on top pointing toward the rim, one ruler on top of the other. Rotate and find the spot on the rim closest to the ruler, slide the bottom one to touch it.  Continue to rotate slowly until you find the furthest away spot. slide the top ruler over without disturbing the bottom one.  Lift both rulers together without disturbing the distance between the two, you'll then see approximately how much the rim is out. Now there is another remote possibility. If there was some crud in the jig when they mate the outer rim and inner face of the wheel for welding and everything is not 100% aligned when they weld it, you'll end up with a wobble.  Who knows how many ""escaped"" quality control."
604103,scugpg,2011-07-18 22:03:00,1373, Went over to DanD's shop this afternoon and sure enough the new rims are also out at least 1/8 of an inch. tested the dial gauge on one hub and it was 2000th of an inch out so I think its safe to say I got 4 bad rims. At this point I'm tempted to go to ct or pa and buy a few....whatever ones are truest I'll keep.
608868,scugpg,2011-08-03 12:09:00,1373, Update: Went to PA and found a set that had a different design to them. They are much better. One has just a slight wobble and the other is almost perfect. They took half as much weight to balance as the original ones I had....which were over 3oz. From what I can tell the quality of trailer rims just isn't 100% true. I suspect if most took a close look at their wheels they would see this.    Thanks again DanD for all your help!
608899,Fisherman,2011-08-03 14:14:00,7201,"Thanks for the update, good info to know."
608957,scugpg,2011-08-03 17:56:00,1373, No problem. I actually found some Aluminum rims on sale today at a good price...those would probably be better as they are cast instead of stamp/welded. Oh well they are working well now.
608959,DanD,2011-08-03 18:10:00,2223,I know you’ve worked at getting this rim thing figured out; but like I told you the other day. Go get a set of mud flaps and I’ll hang them on the front of the fenders; that's so you can’t see the tires & rims in your mirrors and you’re good to go. The one's we hung on there last night will be fine; now go fishing.  Dan.
603363,scugpg,2011-07-16 17:29:00,1373,"Seems trailer questions are appearing lots around here lately  I recently picked up a set of new trailer tires and rims and I notice that they both have a slight wobble to them. DanD and I looked at them and I had them balanced but they are still not running true as we saw on the balancer. I've since got a replacement set of rims to go on and returning the others, however I notice a bit of a wobble with these as well when I put them on the trailer and spin them up.  Is it normal for these smaller rims to not be 100% true? Also is there actually a place to get Canada/US made rims anymore? Everything I see is offshore.  I know the rims are out a bit, but in addition to the rims could the axle/spindle be out a bit? Just wondering if I should take it to a trailer shop to have that checked as well.  Thanks in advance guys!"
603368,Terry,2011-07-16 17:51:00,14456,"are they 12"" or smaller  seems they don't put the same quality into the smaller tires"
603370,scugpg,2011-07-16 17:52:00,1373,Hey Terry - they are 13's with Marathons
603373,Terry,2011-07-16 18:17:00,14456,"are the bearings loose, that would amplify any wobble..  if you think the axle has a little bend/misalignment in it, just run it on the side of the road in the gravel, if the trailer tires kick up a lot more dust then your truck tires, then it could be bent/misaligned"
603379,smally21,2011-07-16 18:57:00,993,"elevate the trailer and push/pull on the tire like you were checking ball joints. tire shouldn't wobble much at all. spin it and see if it runs true. id guess a bearing issue for lack of any other idea.  all axles are bent, it makes the camber on the tire proper and run straight.  marathons are good tires, and no matter where they are made, the wheel was balanced. ived installed hundreds of the offshore rims you are talking about, but never had a wobbly wheel.  now, how much were you drinking before all the wobbling started...."
603381,scugpg,2011-07-16 19:03:00,1373,Rims are torqued and hubs are new  just got 12 notch castle nuts instead of 8 to get them in perfect spot very little play
603383,Terry,2011-07-16 19:08:00,14456," some axles are bent upward for camber and all that does is compensates for the deflection under load  however if bent forward or back, it will make it run untrue trust me, I ripped 3 tires apart trying to get my trailer home with a bend in it but if that is the case you should notice a wear pattern on the leading side of the tire"
603386,scugpg,2011-07-16 19:14:00,1373,Its not a crazy wobble like its going to fall off but noticeable in rear view mirror maybe 1/8 to 1/4 inch out
603394,Rich Clemens,2011-07-16 20:36:00,3131," Now that's very interesting.  Checking out something very similar on my trailer right now.  The outside edge of tread, just on one side, is really wearing down.   Rest of the tread and the other tire is wearing normally.  Less than 4000 miles on them.   BPS thinks it's just the tire, but I'm having a hard-time believing that.  No wobble on the tires and they seem to be running true.   Interesting thread."
603397,Terry,2011-07-16 21:10:00,14456,"easy to check  measure form trailer to inside of tire front and back, they should be the same, if there is a big difference..that's your problem"
603407,scugpg,2011-07-16 21:58:00,1373,"For ""fun"" this afternoon I took one of the rims and hub off to make sure the races are in tight...which they were. Put the old hubs on and noticed similar behavior. Repacked the bearings and put the new hub back on.  Here's a video of the Rim & Tire (which we verified is way out on the balancer), and one of just the new rim. You can see a noticeable wobble. Like I said the hubs are tight but they wheels also spin very smoothly.  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N9sThmkQGy8 http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wyQKFG1ohI4"
603437,zeeter,2011-07-17 00:57:00,92,"Is it possible that the rim is bent from hitting a pot hole really hard?   I've got the same problem.  I replace the bearings and repacked everything with grease, but the tire still wobbles."
603447,scugpg,2011-07-17 01:15:00,1373,  The ones without tires are brand new though and still wobbling. Either rim isn't true or something up with spindle etc. any ideas?
603523,SlowPoke,2011-07-17 12:47:00,2984," Yep, right here in London. I forget the name of the place but its on Firestone Blvd. at Clark and Gore. I'm not sure if they sell to the public though. Those rims are wayyy out; I think you'd blow a tire from flexing/heat in the sidewalls before they wear out prematurely. That would get you to Fanshaw and back without much trouble but I'd get it cured before heading out to the Kawartha's."
603537,glen,2011-07-17 13:41:00,2641,"Great post and vids Scugog.  ""Here's a video of the Rim & Tire (which we verified is way out on the balancer)"" So the rims are no good on the spindle or the balancer?  It must be the rim then right?"
603541,Terry,2011-07-17 13:56:00,14456,I would put a different rim on and spin.. or just the hub and look for wobble.......that rim sure does wobble
603542,scugpg,2011-07-17 14:01:00,1373,Wer could see the wobble on the balancer after the rim and tire were balanced. Haven't put the new rims on the balancer yet. I'll check the hubs.
603543,Terry,2011-07-17 14:10:00,14456,"it is scarey ...13"" rims should be better then that..."
603546,scugpg,2011-07-17 14:18:00,1373,I put a straight edge against just the hub  and spun it around several times and it seems consistent around the outside hub face.  Maybe just a bad batch? New rims are the same design just galvanized.
603558,scugpg,2011-07-17 15:21:00,1373,I put the spare on today (which has been sitting for several years) on to see what it looked like. That one had a bit of wobble but seemed to be signifigantly less than the new ones. Not bad considering its been sitting for so long.  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJAL_J5NJ5Y
603559,SlowPoke,2011-07-17 15:25:00,2984,Maybe we should go get them wet at Fanshaw and see if that makes a difference.
603627,scugpg,2011-07-17 18:50:00,1373,Yes we need to get out sometime its been a while!  So what do you guys think? Just some bad luck with a batch of wheels?
603657,SlowPoke,2011-07-17 19:33:00,2984,"Yeah. Check the bolt pattern, rim width and back spacing and visit the wrecker for some car rims. They'll probably run you $15 ea. + some paint and effort to make 'em look spiffy."
604028,scugpg,2011-07-18 18:57:00,1373,Verified with vendor today that I'm running the correct bearings and races to be sure. Going to put the new rims on the balancer tonight and also check the hubs again to see what the culprit(s) is and get this figured out.
604043,irishfield,2011-07-18 19:17:00,26272,Anyone near you have a dial indicator that you can clamp on to something and put against the face of the hub and turn to see runout?? I have a magnetic base mount in my shop... but I'm not there and you're not close.
