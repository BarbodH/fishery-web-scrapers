609066,BillM,2011-08-04 02:06:00,17367, A few won't do anything to ya..  Just keep it in mind for next time.
609069,chris.brock,2011-08-04 02:39:00,4053,"We only keep/ eat lakers if they have been fataly hooked. Most of ours are natural, and less than 2 lbs, but they aren't the best tasting anyway (compared to other species). They are slow growing and don't sustain fishing pressure that well too. I'm assuming the Lake Michigan Lakers are stocked fish, without natural reproduction, but the bio-accumulated toxins of lakers that size from the great lakes makes them best for catch and release."
609076,wallacio,2011-08-04 03:16:00,475, A dishonest charter boat captain???  No way!!!!
609101,10point,2011-08-04 12:17:00,165,My son is going next week with my Dad with the same guy further up into Michigan for King Salmon. No warning on those.
609126,Fish Farmer,2011-08-04 13:23:00,2234,"Very small if you must. If you want to eat big, you can find a few in dumpsters, ditches around the Hamilton and Toronto area because the big derby is on now. Let them big fish go, take picture, have fun. Release for someone else to have fun."
609136,BillM,2011-08-04 14:14:00,17367, You don't wanna be eating big kings either...   Keep the shakers.
609137,addy79,2011-08-04 14:19:00,573, hahaha
609139,10point,2011-08-04 14:25:00,165, According to the Michigan fish consumption guidelines Pink Salmon of any size are ok to eat. Most lakers are not.  Look at the pictures here from Manistee.  http://www.lakemichigansportfishing.com/photos.html
609143,BillM,2011-08-04 14:46:00,17367,Pink salmon don't grow to 30lbs.  I thought you were fishing for Kings?
609146,10point,2011-08-04 14:57:00,165, Dude I don't know. It's not me fishing. Do they fall under chinook salmon?
609149,troutologist,2011-08-04 15:10:00,951,"  Generally the higher the fat content of a fish, the greater potential to accumulate the aforementioned toxins. These are fat soluble and thus stored in the fat reserves of fishes. By practicing selective harvest of smaller, eating size fish you limit the amount of time the fish (meal) has been in the ecosystem and thus limit the potential for it to accumulate toxins. Further, fish that are eating a steady diet of oily baitfish, (read: smelt, alewives, cisco) will accumulate toxins to a greater extent that a fish that eats aqautic inverts or plankton. Each step up the food chain causes what is referred to as biomagnification of contaminants, essentially the highest order consumer (you in this case) will be eating the lake trout's meals, the smelt's meals, etc. for the entire lifespan of each.  Again, selective harvest.  Lake trout fried is awesome by the way. Smaller fish from inland lakes or those further north typically have more orange or red flesh which is a good indicator of good tasting trout."
609256,Pickeral eater,2011-08-04 20:54:00,155,Have eaten a few while camping both fried and over the fire in the 3lb range and theyre great.  Would think a 2-3 lb laker from lake o ok.  Hasn't been around too long.
609413,Rich,2011-08-05 14:31:00,3927,I wouldn't do it with a great lakes fish.
609417,Roy,2011-08-05 14:40:00,13728,"No worries.....apparently, if you load it up with garlic butter you'll have poor man's lobster."
608697,10point,2011-08-02 20:29:00,165,Are lake trout like the one below good fried? I have been cooking them on the grill but I am in the mood for a fish fry.  
608699,DRIFTER_016,2011-08-02 20:35:00,10439,"Depends where they are coming from. If it came from any of the Great Lakes I would say ""NO"" as they are way to greasy. If it came from any lake near me in the NWT I would say ""Hell Yeah!!!!"" The trout up here are damn fine when fried."
608701,10point,2011-08-02 20:36:00,165, All mine are from Lake Michigan
608702,grt1,2011-08-02 20:38:00,638,"yup, there really good, but it looks like you'll need a REALLY big frying pan!!!"
608703,ckrb2007,2011-08-02 20:40:00,449,I would say a nice 2-3lb'er maybe......but not a big greaser like the one you're holding......blah!
608711,10point,2011-08-02 21:00:00,165, They have been good on the grill!
608715,ckrb2007,2011-08-02 21:04:00,449," lol....true, I guess enough butter, garlic and spices would kill any taste. heehee"
608716,DRIFTER_016,2011-08-02 21:07:00,10439,"Grilling enables all the fat to burn off, not so with frying as it just holds it in."
608718,mark02,2011-08-02 21:15:00,27,"Smoked trout/char is my favourite.  Takes a lot of work but it's worth it.  Easiest way to cook would be to cut into steaks and grill in the oven (400 degrees for 10 minutes) with a little lemon, salt and pepper.  Make sure you remove the belly fat."
608720,craigdritchie,2011-08-02 21:29:00,1586,"As Drifter notes, lakers are comparatively oily fish, so they are best when grilled, broiled, smoked or prepared any other way that allows the grease to run off. They're not the best choice for frying or deep frying.  Ever try them on the BBQ on a cedar plank? Go buy a cedar plank at the grocery store (or use a one-eighth to one-quarter inch thick red cedar plank) that's been pre-soaked in water for several hours. Set the BBQ to medium heat (400 degrees), rub a little olive oil on the top side of the plank, and lay the fillet on it skin side down. Put it on the grill, then baste with this glaze: one-half cup of pure maple syrup (not Aunt Jemima or synthetic junk like that) mixed with three tablespoons of Soy Sauce and a teaspoon of minced garlic. Pour it on and give the fish approx 15 minutes. Test for doneness by twisting a fork in it - if it flakes easily, it's done.  It's really a salmon recipe, but it works great with lake trout as well. Serve with garlic mashed potatoes and some steamed green beans or carrots. Beer works, or a chilled white wine (Riesling, in particular) is even better.  You can also prepare this in the oven, but be advised it's pretty messy."
608731,irishfield,2011-08-02 22:08:00,26272,MMMMMM Lake Trout  Deep fried    BBQ'd  
608735,hendrix,2011-08-02 22:45:00,61,some fish tastes amazing no matter how you cook it
608736,canadadude,2011-08-02 22:46:00,769,Easiest way to cook a greasy laker is to drop the ugly freak back in the lake hahaha
608737,bushart,2011-08-02 22:53:00,2628,That big---I would'nt  Be like eatin a pail of raw smelts in July sun
608742,danc,2011-08-02 23:12:00,4677,"Not surprising you're getting lots of different answers on this one. I've had deep fried Lake Trout that was both the best and the worst fish that I've ever eaten. Quality of the fish (what forage base the lake has) is the key, and determines how fatty the fish are. Lake Superior smelt eaters are the worst I've had. I used to fish Dryberry Lake, just south of Kenora, and the shore lunch Lakers from there were fit for a king. I'm not sure what the forage base was there (certainly not smelts) but the meat on those fish were bright orange and there wasn't an ounce of fat on them."
608748,canadadude,2011-08-02 23:33:00,769,"I agree I'v eat'en laker from hell, but I have also had laker prepared ok from the great lakes.but like Dan has said if you had Lakers from there natural enviroment forgetabout it.....it is what is"
608753,Fish Farmer,2011-08-02 23:45:00,2234,"If that L.Trout is from Lake O, I don't think the dump wants them because their contaminated waste. The only thing I'd eat from Lake O would be a ""SMALL"" Coho, Rainbow or Atlantic and then in moderation. A Lake Trout that big belongs back in the lake or if dead,Raccoon food. Fun to catch, nice fish. Keep the small ones, safer for you. Eat if you must, but I have a few friends that are Great Lakes Biologist's, and believe me, they wouldn't touch them."
608761,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2011-08-03 00:02:00,0,i enjoy lakers from smaller inland lakes up to about 3lbs.  anything bigger than that and i don't like the flavour (or the contamination).
608762,Fish Farmer,2011-08-03 00:03:00,2234,"I just noticed, was that a charter you were on? Lots of times they want to get you a fish so you don't go back to shore empty. The bottom of Lake O is covered with them like Gobies in curtain spots. Draging a lure and ball on the bottom will produce big #'s. Still a nice fish to catch and have fun."
608871,Fish4Eyes,2011-08-03 12:37:00,1022,Do you guys think 2-3lb laker from Lake O is ok for eating?
608902,RyanT,2011-08-03 14:24:00,72,I know someone who fries his Lake Trout and says it's good.  They're only about 5lbs though from a small Quebec lake... not beasts like in that pic.  I would never do it though... trout tastes great and it seems like a waste to fry it.  Like it would overpower the great taste of trout.
608946,10point,2011-08-03 16:47:00,165," Yes, it was a charter on Lake Michigan. We didn't go back empty!  "
609006,wallacio,2011-08-03 22:23:00,475,"Lake Trout are long-lived, slow growing fish that really concentrate environmental contaminants such as PCBs and Methyl Mercury.   You might serious want to think twice about eating any of those fish pictured with the exception of the smallest ones.  Here is Indiana's guide to eating fish - see page 40 for Lake Michigan...they do not recommend eating ANY Lake Trout over 27"" and only a limited amount of fish under that length.  http://www.in.gov/isdh/files/2010_FCA.pdf"
609007,BillM,2011-08-03 22:26:00,17367, Famous last words!!  lol
609050,10point,2011-08-04 01:19:00,165, Thanks for the info and for ruining my day. Of course our captain told us they were all fine up to 30 lbs or something.
