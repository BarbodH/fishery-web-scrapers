606928,misfish,2011-07-27 21:26:00,29133," You can bet that draw was done, along time ago.   Just saying.   Im going buck all the way this year. Both for the bow and rifle. Done with the controlled bull."
606984,bucktail,2011-07-27 23:25:00,1857,Me too Brian. I have 2 large bucks on the property I am hunting. I might apply for the elk hunt next year since I know a fair amount of farmers north of Belleville and I have a few years of Elk under my belt. Great deal on game cams at BPS next week.   Darren

608751,richyb,2011-08-02 23:42:00,774,Just calf tags for our group this year. I have been applying for 10 years and have never got an adult! Maybe this is the year I see momma with TWINS.

608936,cityfisher,2011-08-03 16:30:00,959,no luck for our group in either the elk or the moose draw... BOOO

608954,anders,2011-08-03 17:34:00,1168,Bull and Cow tag for us this year at least havent heard the other guy but 2 is plenty for us
608955,Court R,2011-08-03 17:36:00,213,Bull tag for me!
609013,Skud,2011-08-03 23:06:00,739,I struck out with the moose draw.
609027,bassjnkie,2011-08-04 00:24:00,1101,Cow tag for us!!
609043,Billy Bob,2011-08-04 01:14:00,5865,"Ontario needs to look how NYS does it anterless deer drawings and maybe apply it to all it's drawings......at the time we purchase our big game license we put in for our ""doe"" tag(s)....the computer gives you a instant tag or NOT.....  I had my doubts about this system when it first started about 6-7 years ago....but it works VERY WELL.....we had the old system where we had to get a party of 2-4 hunters, send in by snail mail and the wait and HOPE to see if we selected while more government workers that I don't trust decided on my fate.....I'll trust a computer any day of the week over the old system.... Ontario needs to get with it...."
609073,jedimaster,2011-08-04 03:07:00,3472,Does anyone know anyone that got an elk tag? I have talked to 5 guys each with groups of 6 and none got an elk tag. That 33 people I know that went in and didn't get one.
609282,richyb,2011-08-04 22:31:00,774,A guy on another ontario board that im a member of got an elk tag. That would be one hack of a rush !
609294,Billy Bob,2011-08-04 23:04:00,5865,"The ""rush"" comes after you can say ""elk down""....anyone can hunt elk (with or without the proper license)...it's bagging a ELK (legally) that completes the hunt...IMHO....but others not so much.."
