608641,DRIFTER_016,2011-08-02 16:24:00,10439,It always saddens me when I read about true trophies that end up in a fisherman's net. I know there isn't a lot of pressure on our fish up here but it takes too long to replace a fish like this. I clipped this article from yesterdays paper.
608652,BillM,2011-08-02 16:50:00,17367,"That thing looks like a triploid, lol!!"
608654,markiemark70,2011-08-02 16:55:00,158,"Look at it this way, that thing just made way for like 6 good eaters. And if like the expert said it may not be reproducing, it really was just taking up space.  Sad day perhaps for people who want to hang something on the wall, great day for the ecosystem of GSL."
608681,Lunker777,2011-08-02 19:10:00,866,CHEESE AND RICE !!!!! The fish looks like its going to die anyways.... HUGE fish though
608691,eman,2011-08-02 20:13:00,101,"thats a tough call.  If I caught a fish over 50 lbs, potentially being a record......I'd like to think I would release her.  The scales most people carry usually only go to 50lbs, so you couldn't even get an accurate #. A fish with such a disproportionate belly will most likely estimate accurately with girth & length measurements."
608693,irishfield,2011-08-02 20:16:00,26272,I think some are missing this was caught in a net... it was D>O>A !
608695,mercman,2011-08-02 20:18:00,7054,That thing looks like a living cartoon. Man thats one ugly monster  
608706,Spiel,2011-08-02 20:50:00,9065,  Exactly!  I'd like to see the scientists have at her to determine the particulars and history of this beast.   
608740,Bob,2011-08-02 23:04:00,370,"The one they mentioned from Athabaska was 102 lbs. The mount hung in the ROM for years but that was a long time ago. I saw it way back when, last time probably more than 40 years ago. Apparently, it had no gonads so it was technically sexless."
608777,Rizzo,2011-08-03 00:23:00,4754,"wow, that fish is just plain ugly"
608790,Whitespinnerbait,2011-08-03 00:46:00,2038,Looks to me like it was soon to be Snapping Turtle Food anyways
608972,jimmer,2011-08-03 19:52:00,2730,"It's tough to lose a fish like that, but there are no survivors when it comes to commercial fishing. It doesn't have to breed to be someone's trophy, that fish could have provided a few anglers with the PB laker over the next decade. Why does everything have to be biological when placing value on wildlife? I hear you Drifter!"
