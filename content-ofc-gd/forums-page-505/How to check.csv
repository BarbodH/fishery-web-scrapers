609310,misfish,2011-08-04 23:57:00,29133,Pretty simple question. How can one check to find out if a lean is on a boat?  If I spelt it wrong oh well.LOL
609315,Roy,2011-08-05 00:31:00,13728,"Brian, to the best of my knowledge, you can search all of Canada for liens on real estate, vehicles etc... Unfortunately, Ontario, Alberta and BC don't have a classification for boat serial numbers. You might have to search by name of the original owner. I'd be interested in a definitive answer out of curiosity."
609317,workwear,2011-08-05 00:46:00,592,my wife works for a lawyer...and she says to do a ppsa search.....brian...why dont you give me your serial numbers and info and she can get it done....let me know
609323,irishfield,2011-08-05 00:56:00,26272,"You can use a PPSA mediary to do the search for you... it'll just cost you an extra $10 or more.  Search costs $8 Brian.. $8 more if you want a certified document sent to you. You'll need their full name as registered on the vessel registration, their date of birth and address they live at/document is issued to.  Be prepared for.. ""they owe the brick $XXXX, GMC $XXXX, mortgage to TD finance $XXX. If nothing comes up on the boat.. nobody has claim to it even if he owes money privately to someone. "
