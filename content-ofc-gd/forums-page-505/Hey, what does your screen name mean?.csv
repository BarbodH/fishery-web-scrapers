There was one spot where the trees overhung the bank and I would try to put my lure under the branches.  What usually happened was me throwing my lure up into the trees. I also did that on the Coldwater river, Sturgeon River, etc etc etc.  Thus I chose ""Overcast""  Tom."

I needed to relieve myself so went out of the hut and into the ""heated"" bathroom, warmest bathroom I have ever used while ice fishing. When I returned my buddies were all snickering and said that I had a fish on. Sure enough when I pulled the line in there was a squid at the end of the line, dead of course. I was like "" nice try guys"" and threw the squid on a plate and it began to leak ink so I tossed it out into the night. Next morning the hut owner comes by to collect the $$ for the weekend and my buddy is standing behind me telling the owner that I caught a fresh water squid!! The owner said no way it was probably a mud puppy!! I figure that at this point my buddy gave the owner several winks and the owner caught on. All of a sudden he says "" well maybe it was!! there has not been on caught here in 100 yrs.""!! I was like what the hell!! He asks me to show it to him. I grab the squid and sure enough the owner is praising the lord!! Jesus I can't believe it!! This is so rare!! We need a picture for the North Bay Nugget!! At this point I was totally confused. I have to say here that it is very difficult if not impossible to suck me into believing a prank like this. Anyways pictures were taken and one of the guys told me that there was a 500 dollar fin for keeping it so I tossed it down an ice fishing hole. I did no find out until the next day that it was all a joke.."
