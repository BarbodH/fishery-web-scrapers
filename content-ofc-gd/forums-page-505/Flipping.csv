608322,ld17,2011-08-01 18:25:00,319,Hey guys anyone out there still flipping with heavy mono or fluoro?  I have a heavy rod with 50lb braid but was thinking of using 20lb test on my med heavy rod.  Reason being is I think it will help with line tangle from short pitches and flips on my casting reel with the thicker diameter mono vs braid?

I can,t understand how it can be used as a main line .Seems to me that because it is so stiff, it would have the tendancy to 'jump' off the spool and end up a tangled mess,but then again, i'm a complete newb with this line ."
608375,ecmilley,2011-08-01 21:07:00,2163,I only use braid on all my heavy flippin/pitchen equipment ranging from 40lb to 80lb line

608590,Gregoire,2011-08-02 12:18:00,1397,I would think for flipping and pitching Fluoro would be a better choice as is sinks vs mono which floats. Also the stretch in mono may make it harder to pull fish out of cover.
608592,Fang,2011-08-02 12:21:00,1330,25 or 30 lb XT goes on my heavy worm rod. Running a 3/4 - 1.5 oz weight for punching through heavy mats. Never really liked the way braid worked in these situations. On my regular worm and jig rod though I run 20-50 lb braid and tied direct to hook.

608778,Garry2Rs,2011-08-03 00:25:00,1425,I have 20# Trilene Big Game on a reel that I use on a medium 7ft. rod for flippin & pitchin.  I find the traditional heavy action 7.5ft telescopic rods too stiff for the smaller jigs that I prefer.  I also use 40# braid on one 6.5ft rod.  Go with what you like...there are no rules...grin.
608948,beagle dad,2011-08-03 17:04:00,224,FOR WHAT ITS WORTH I SPOOL MY REELS WITH BRAID. WHEN SHORT FLIPS I PULL OFF 50 FT OF LINE COVER THE REST OF SPOOL WITH ELECTRICAL TAPE THEN WIND LINE BACK IN FIND IT REDUCES TANGLE GREATLY  CAN DO THE SAME JOINING MONO OR FLORO TO BRAID COVER KNOT IN SPOOL WITH TAPE WIND ON WHAT U NEED  AND GOOD TO GO  
609162,Rich,2011-08-04 15:51:00,3927,I have one flippin' stick with 14lb test mono. Works just fine.
609320,dada2727,2011-08-05 00:53:00,108,"50 lb braid all the way.  Tried flouro a few years ago....then tried it again this year....and keep going back to braid.  If the water is clear I'll tied on a 20 lb flouro leader material (seagar) and have never had a problem with it yet.  Don't use 17 lb flouro as a leader when flippin docks and stuff, I learned the hard way....."
609331,ld17,2011-08-05 01:37:00,319, You said you tried fluoro a few years ago and then again this year.  What did you find and why did you try again?
