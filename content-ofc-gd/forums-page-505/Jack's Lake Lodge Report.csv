609026,saspirilli,2011-08-04 00:16:00,27,"Back in the city after a great weekend fishing Jack's Lake and staying with the amazing folks at Jack's Lake Lodge (http://www.jackslakelodge.com/).  While the blazing hot afternoon weather made for slow daytime fishing, we did have success in the mornings and early evenings fishing smallmouth with texas-rigged worms and weedless plastic jigs. Fish were all caught in the log-filled bays or over the extended, submerged weed beds. We didn't get into any huge fish and topped out at a two pounder.  We also managed to get into some very nice 3/4 pound crappie on crankbaits off of the resort dock.  A big thank you to resort owner Joe for giving us a great bait and presentation tutorial. It was a valuable and much appreciated lesson from a master for this group of fisherman still learning the craft.  I wouldn't hesitate to recommend this lake and this resort.  Thanks to board member Hank. Jr. for the suggestion and advance lake tips."
609220,Hank Jr,2011-08-04 18:36:00,146,Sounds like you had a good week . I'am glad the tips I gave you helped . Sounds like the weather was a little hot but nothing you can do about the weather. We still have to wait another 6 weeks until our trip .

609328,Dave Bailey,2011-08-05 01:21:00,1641,"Stayed there in '08, had fun. Joe and Nancy are nice people. How's Nancy doing by the way? She had that 'liberation therapy' for her MS last year. I'm skeptical of it myself, but it would be interesting to see if she shows any change."
609336,ckrb2007,2011-08-05 01:50:00,449,Glad you guys had fun on a great lake. I've been going up there since I was 4yrs old. I have a trailer over at Jacks Lake TRailer park and fish there and ATV there every weekend.  Lot's of awesome spots to fish.
609345,scugpg,2011-08-05 02:46:00,1373,"Looks like a nice place I'll give them a shout would like to stay there this fall.  They have walleye, muskie, and lake trout in that lake as well correct?"
609347,ckrb2007,2011-08-05 02:56:00,449,"Yes.....walleye, musky, small and largies, crappy and lakers.......although the lakers are few and far btwn. I personally saw a 14lb'er caught there this year."
609374,cityfisher,2011-08-05 12:07:00,959,How is the atving in the area ? Joe told me no ATv trails around them ......when I get there I see quads and bikes zipping all over the place 
609478,ckrb2007,2011-08-05 17:01:00,449," I was probably one of those ATV's zipping by the lodge on the weekend. lol There are tons of trails just past the lodge. You can ATV right around the entire lake, head to the petroglyphs(spelling) near Stoney Lake, or just cruise around on many other trails. If you keep driving past the lodge....maybe 15 mins or so, you'll notice some main hydro lines crossing the road. Turn onto the hydro right of way and you're onto some awesome trails."
609527,cityfisher,2011-08-05 19:35:00,959,Thanks! ill know for next time ... I assume Joe doesn't have a sweat spot for atvers!
609556,ckrb2007,2011-08-05 20:59:00,449,No problem. I'm guessing 99% of them don't obey the max 40km/hr sign on the road there.
609611,adempsey,2011-08-05 23:39:00,1498,One of my favorite Kawartha Lakes.   Was hoping to get back this year and maybe even hit it up for some ice fishing someday.  Thanks for sharing!
609681,pinerider,2011-08-06 04:28:00,8,"Nice to see that others appreciate my favourite spot in the universe!  Joe certainly knows fish and fishing and is more than willing to share his knowledge! By the way, a friend of mine is selling his trailer @ The Anchorage next door to Jacks Lake Lodge, PM me for details if you're interested."
