609564,crappieperchhunter,2011-08-05 21:16:00,2582,I have always thought they where entitled to take the conservation limit...but I'm not 100% on this one.
609566,irishfield,2011-08-05 21:17:00,26272,They are entitled to the full sport limit if they're a Canadian citizen ! Non-residents count against an adults limit holding a licence.  Remember they need a birth certificate or similar to prove their age and residency and this constitutes their fishing licence.
609568,solopaddler,2011-08-05 21:18:00,8605, No one I've talked to is either.
609569,solopaddler,2011-08-05 21:19:00,8605, Thanks Wayne! Can I find that somewhere on the MNR's site? I looked but could find no mention of it.
609571,irishfield,2011-08-05 21:23:00,26272,"I'm looking, but I am 100% positive that is gospel. Just be sure you have ID for the kidlets with you to show they are Cdn citizens. Applicable in Ontario anyhow... In QC one licence does the whole famdamly!"
