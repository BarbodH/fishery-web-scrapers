608969,Cudz,2011-08-03 19:46:00,2652,I have been using my few swammers from the autumn season and I used them ice fishing too.  I only had 3 and I lost one so I only had 2 left and they were badly worn but still work.  Anyway I made a side trip to rack and reel today and they have a great selection there.  If you are in the barrie area and are looking for swammers they finally have them.  I will be trying them this week.  I will let you know how they work.
