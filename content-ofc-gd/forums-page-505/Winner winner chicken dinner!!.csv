Apparently the odds are 1 in 3. Tickets are $100.00 each, or 3 for $250.00. We bought 3. Today we were informed that we are the proud owners of a shiny new Hamilton Beach Panini Grill!! Value is 60 bucks. I have it reserved the week of November 19th to the 25th. All kidding aside, we are proud to support such a foundation. Chances are most of us will need their help sooner or later. Anyone else here win anything??"
