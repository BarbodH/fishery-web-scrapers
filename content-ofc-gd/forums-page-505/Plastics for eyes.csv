609112,bubbles,2011-08-04 12:43:00,591,"Headed up north in a about a month or so and came across this on their site  Scented baits do not work well in the north. Actually, Walleyes will avoid lures that have had scent put on them so make sure you wash your lures and if you are going to buy twistertails for jigs, get unscented. Twistertails do not work that well either. Green, pink and white jig heads with just a worm works best.  Really? no gulp, no plastic.....I read so much about poeple saying they do the exact opposite and use no live bait! Thoughts?"
609119,Fish Farmer,2011-08-04 13:06:00,2234,"I've had great luck with Chompers Garlic worms 4"" Pumpkinseed, up north used on a single blade harness and split shot. Works great when small pan fish that rob you before Walleye get a chance. I'm a big fan of Live worms also, but sometime you have to brake down and use what works. But I tell you. they stink  , some of my buds hate when I dig them out. I ordered mine from the states, Bass Pro carries them here."
609120,BillM,2011-08-04 13:07:00,17367,It sounds like they are rubes to be honest.
609125,fishindevil,2011-08-04 13:19:00,6254,"thats what i was thinking ,they just want you to buy their live bait !!!! plastics work dont worry,i suppose trolling rapalas,and reef runners dont work either.!!! lol...lol..dont listen to them please....cheers"
609128,bushart,2011-08-04 13:31:00,2628,Good One  Wonder do they think you should cut the points off the hooks  Gramma knots are best  fish with bobbers at noon 1 foot down in 100 feet of water  Troll at 25 mph  anyone else?
609133,mike rousseau,2011-08-04 13:54:00,4661,"I've seen Darel  Cronzy doing ""Up North""  tv shows with gulp and doing pretty damn good...  And if you dont catch on plastics... Then pay for their bait"
609134,mike rousseau,2011-08-04 13:57:00,4661,  Actually... My best walleye fishing is high noon... I don't catch anything before 10am... Usually things get going around 11am...
609138,Jigs,2011-08-04 14:21:00,136," Hum....Not true for any of the walleyes I've met in my life. To me a walleye is a walleye north or south I don't know.  I used to pull spinners with nightcrawlers a lot and since the Gobies took over I switched to 4 inch gulp minnows. Now I probably wouldn't go back to worms even if the Gobies were gone. I took a trip up to Nipissing a couple years back and hammered walleyes on quarter ounce jigs and gulp minnows so it works ""up north"" too. Like others mentioned if I were a betting man I'd say they don't want you using them up there for whatever reason."
609223,mark02,2011-08-04 18:56:00,27,"GULP denitely works up north.  Given what they've said, however, I'd bring along a flat of worms just to be on the safe side."
609227,Fish4Eyes,2011-08-04 19:19:00,1022,"For me it comes down to what I have confidence in. When i'm up north I use jig and worms all weekenend with a 90% success rate. On those slow days, I try to experiment using artificial and they don't seem to want that either."
609228,mike rousseau,2011-08-04 19:21:00,4661, probably because you tried it on a slow day...  you have to try new tactics and locations when they are biting
609259,Pickeral eater,2011-08-04 20:57:00,155,"Have heard same thing that plastics don't work, however, started throwing raps and had lots of success once I found fish using worms.   Doesn't hurt to try something new"
