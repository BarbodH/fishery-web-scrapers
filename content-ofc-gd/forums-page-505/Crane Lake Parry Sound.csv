608893,hookerdown,2011-08-03 13:36:00,110,"I am renting a cottage on Crane Lake near Parry Sound at the end of the month for 5 days with my GF and my Brother.  Its owned by a friend of my GF.  The cottage comes with a 14ft Tinner with an older Outboard.  The cottage is near Crane Lake Resort.  Seen a few pictures and the bay the cottage is in looks promising for SM bass.  Talking to the owner, there is also good fishing off the dock for Smallies (good for the kids).  Has anyone fished that end of the lake and what can be caught in the area? Keeping in mind I don't think we would be able to venture to far from the cottage due to the boat.  As well are there any slot limits that we need to keep in mind.  Thanks  James"

We did ok (not great)for pike, and caught a decent pickerel by accident. Kind of a so so lake, one of the few with musky out there but they are pretty hard to come by"
