608901,ufish2,2011-08-03 14:19:00,15,Was driving through Hagersville to get to Port Dover and noticed some large ponds in the area.  Is anybody familiar with these ponds?  Looks like they might be a good fishing spot ??  Thanks in advance
608911,tb4me,2011-08-03 15:01:00,3295,I have never fished there but by the posted signs and considering what land they sit on Id stay out of there..Perhaps you can get permission to fish there from a land owner? I dont know for sure. I belive they are owned by natives that dont want anyone in there. Keep us posted if you decide to persue this further..Those lakes look real deep..
