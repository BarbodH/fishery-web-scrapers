609368,Roy,2011-08-05 11:33:00,13728,"Where did you find one of those, Brian? As far as I know they're a re-branded big name boat but very basic/entry level."
609369,misfish,2011-08-05 11:39:00,29133,Here in Barrie. I have seen this boat around for a few years and is now for sale for a reasonable price.
609370,Roy,2011-08-05 12:00:00,13728,"Well if it's sound and offered at a reasonable price, check it out."
609375,misfish,2011-08-05 12:08:00,29133,"As soon as the new owners of my boat put cash in my hand this morning, I will."
609389,BillM,2011-08-05 13:08:00,17367,"Brian, I thought for you'd be buying one of those boats off of hwy69 that tease me everytime I drive by, lol!!!!"
609390,SmokestackLightnin,2011-08-05 13:09:00,390,"Further to what Roy said, Northwoods were originally manufactured by Smoker/Sylvan with different specs that would fit a budget conscious purchaser. They started in the Minnesota/Wisconsin markets and then expanded from there. Some people may say they were factory seconds but that is not entirely true. You will find them to be a lot lighter than comparable sized big name boats and therefore have a lower max hp rating. If you are interested in one look at it with a fine tooth comb and make sure you check the transom for signs of seam splitting and/or pitting. The boats also had a lighter load rating then comparable units which will restrict the amount of tackle you bring."
609418,ssminnow,2011-08-05 14:41:00,48,I have a little 14' Northwood that is about 18 years old.  It has been a good boat and still does not leak although it has not been used alot. It sits on the ramp most of the time more of a backup although I used to use it quite a bit for the first 6 or 7 years.
