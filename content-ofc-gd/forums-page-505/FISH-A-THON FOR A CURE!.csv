605755,Lake Ranger,2011-07-24 13:07:00,70,Just a quick note to thank Ryan and Dan and everyone involved with the Fish-A-Thon yesterday for putting on an incredibly amazing event. Alot of hard work and dedication was put forth by a ton of people and everyone should be proud of all their efforts in helping to make the day a huge success! A special thanks again to everyone for their support with Off The Dock Toons and for all the great exposure it received yesterday. It was great to see fisherfolk friends again and meet a great bunch of new ones! Already looking forward to providing new and exciting OTD products for donation to next year's 'Casting for a Cure'! Here's one of our happy little customers from yesterday making a real statement! 
605786,Leecher,2011-07-24 15:35:00,7832, Excellence at it's best   CONGRATS TO ALL
605818,tightline,2011-07-24 18:50:00,322,"Had a great time out there yesterday , the bite was tough but a fun time was had!!  10600 is a super number and were all proud to have reached it..Way to go OFC'rs and everybody else involved it was one heck of a show!"
606022,danbouck,2011-07-25 12:50:00,4380,"I just wanted to thank EVERYONE for the help. Every single person from this board stepped up and helped out with everything. Frank, Juli and the kids basically set up the prize table, HTHM and Loonietoon for BBQing, Kickingfrog for helping to unload my truck, MikeP for my new secret weapon and to everyone else that helped  I'm starting to work on next years event stuff after my vacation next week at the cottage"
606039,The Urban Fisherman,2011-07-25 13:26:00,2050," Thanks for that post Dano!  Everything is all cleaned up as of yesterday afternoon and the park was more than happy with the way everything went.  They wanted me to thank you guys for being such a great group in the park! Went off without a hitch, and they're proud to have been able to host us and our event!  Cheers, Ryan"
609594,ohhenrygsr,2011-08-05 22:12:00,947,It was a pleasure being able to help out fellow OFC Members and also the fish a thon event. Hope the memories where bigger than the fish
609666,Rich,2011-08-06 03:19:00,3927,I pounded 'er as hard as I could that day but just couldn't make it happen. Still one of the most well-memoried trips of the year though. Thanks to all involved!
605387,asdve23rveavwa,2011-07-22 14:36:00,2690," Yeah, things are tough for alot of people.  That news article on the Canadian Cancer Society a few weeks back didn't help either...actually had a couple people mention that while getting a few of our pledges. However, anything helps!! It's great to see what can be done with ""modern medicine""...ask Wayne!"
605439,danbouck,2011-07-22 18:30:00,4380,"I'm off boys and girls, see you in the am"
605459,Handlebarz,2011-07-22 19:39:00,3790,"  Frank I here ya on that as my Grandfather lost his battle a short time after they found his cancer back in the 80's, but my father has been giving a great battle for 5 years now and is 2 years past his expiry date that they gave him.( he still sais he has 5 years left in him) I dont post alot of updates but he did get good news on Monday he gets to take the summer off and not start up until October so we plan to get a bunch of fishing in before October comes around."
605469,asdve23rveavwa,2011-07-22 20:18:00,2690,"Quick weather update for Langton area...chance of t-storms...60% AM, 30% afternoon, 40 % PM. Ryan does have the pavilion rented out, so we definitely have a dry spot if necessary.  The lake is relatively small for those that don't know it, so, if we do have thunder and/or lightning rolling in, we can get back to the launch area quickly. If you're using mono line and it starts to float...get the heck off the water (speaking from experience on this one!!). Let's ALL have a fantastic time, and be safe!! Looking forward to seeing some of you that I haven't seen in awhile, as well as, meeting a bunch of others"
605496,d_paluch,2011-07-22 22:37:00,343,"The girlfriend and I are pumped for this!  I have been counting down the days since I originally heard about it! Only got $90 in pledges, but every penny counts! Hope everyone has a good time tomorrow and we stay dry, I would hate for it to rain hard as my poor dinghy wouldn't survive very well  If anyone knows any hotspots pm me, I'll take any tips that are being given  Good Luck all!"
605510,vinnimon,2011-07-23 00:10:00,2593,"Sorry Folks, we cant make it there this year"
605515,asdve23rveavwa,2011-07-23 00:15:00,2690, Sorry to hear that Vince.

Now I have to push 3 days of work into 2 at home . I told my girls this as well and a chance thunderstorms as well. They took it well. My youngest made me promise a morning of fishing on sunday Best of luck to all of you that are attending"

604646,skinny,2011-07-20 10:06:00,442,hey all heard a ad on the radio promoting the fish a thon it was on CD98.9 as a comming event
604655,danbouck,2011-07-20 11:02:00,4380,"Yep, 98.9 will be there  3 more sleeps"
604695,The Urban Fisherman,2011-07-20 13:18:00,2050," You wish Geoff! haha   If you can't make it we'll fair out ok but will miss you dude - If you decide to come last minute I will be glad to launch your boat for you, or let you use my truck to launch!   Yepp - anything from a canoe to a 21 foot bass boat can launch in there... NO GAS MOTORS ARE ALLOWED TO BE USED THOUGH... just a reminder for the rest of the gang..   We'll figure it out - always do!   THANKS TO LEGEND BOATS! What an awesome prize pack!   I'll be there early to as will Dan so we'll find some place to put the boats while we launch... we talked about doing a group photo in the evening instead so we might be able to treat it like a regular tournament if we want... if the launch area get's to jammed up people can just hop in their boats and float around the launch chatting until go-time.... but we'll see how many actual boats show up and figure it out... it'll all be good!   Yepp - fantastic -  thank you to everybody involved!   Kick 'em in the butt Frank!  Tell them if they want to win a cool prize they'll want to get there early!   Thank you so much Lew! It's a group effort so the thank you's certainly shouldn't all be thrown my way, there's myself, Dan, Shawn and everybody else here on OFC but there's also all kinds of other people behind the scenes!  Your pledge is a HUGE help, and we can't thank you enough!!! JohnF used to make an anonymous $100.00 pledge, to help kick things off... this early pledge reminds me of John, and sort of makes me feel like that void has been filled...  Thank you so much! I'll fire you my address VIA PM."

604387,SRT8 smoker craft,2011-07-19 15:53:00,1107,  I am going early and will take my boat over to the front docks there's a big area between the docks that is all sand & clay that we can beach a bunch of boats because there isn't enough room at the launch for us all to hang around and I think it would be a good spot to get a pic of this great bunch of people.
604391,tightline,2011-07-19 16:05:00,322,81 participants...this is AWESOME!!!!!

604083,Handlebarz,2011-07-18 21:15:00,3790,Is there a count for how many boats will be there? I think we might bring ours after all it will be to hot to have the kids sit on the dock all day or in a canoe.  I think I might rig up some extra canopy for the back of the boat as our top covers the driver and passenger maybe a blanket from front to back of the boat right over my top that is on it I think a 14' canopy will do the trick.
600861,The Urban Fisherman,2011-07-09 02:49:00,2050,My mother in law saw hot dogs on sale and bought 168 of them! lol now we just need to find buns on Sale!
