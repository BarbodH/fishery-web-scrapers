608710,Bernie,2011-08-02 20:57:00,3190,"It's been pretty hard to pick a week this summer with poor weather, around here anyway. No major projects around the cottage to do during this weeks holidays so taking the time with Karen and son Alex to relax and enjoy. We have been out fishing a few times already and while we are not filling the boat with fish each time we have had some respectable catches. The pickerel are in deeper water it seems but have heard though the grapevine some guys have been doing well catching limits of pickerel in the weeds. I haven't the patience to pull the weeds off my hook each cast so I hit the deeper shoals and put up with the odd rock snag. Fishing between 30 and 40 feet of water seems to be the preferred depth. On the sonar I am looking for signs of baitfish and activity on the bottom.  This is an example of what we have been picking up in an hour or two.   Karen and I both had a smallmouth hit in 35 ft of water. Mine made it into the net but Karens did a surface tail dance and flipped off. She did have the fun of winding it up. These are great sport fish, no wonder guys like to catch them.     We just got back about an hour ago trying out the fishing on calm waters and baking sunshine. It was my turn to catch a couple of nice pickerel. The first one was just shy of going over the slot size, 23"". The second measured out at 22.5"". Both put up a good fight making the drag sing. Thought I had a sheepshead but was thrilled to see it wasn't.     We will probably use up a few more worms this week. I'm glad Karen and Alex enjoy fishing as much or more than me!"
