My family and friends will be staying on the lake this upcoming week and hoping to get into some nice sized fish and get some pics up myself.  You guys are making me jealous with the beauties you all post lol!! Any who, any info helps. Thanks Bill"

609272,Rod Caster,2011-08-04 21:42:00,5784,It has decent fish. Typical bass and walleye tricks will work. You'll get something! I guarantee (disclosure: I do not guarantee)
