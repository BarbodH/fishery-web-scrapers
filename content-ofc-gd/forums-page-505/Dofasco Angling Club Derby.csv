Tickets are available at most of the local bait and tackle stores around Hamilton, and from any of the club executive. Tickets must be purchased prior to midnight on Friday, they will not be available for sale during the Derby period (starts midnight on Friday, and ends at 5:00pm on Sunday). Tournament headquarters is at the Austin Park boat launch (east of Knight's Beach) The other weigh-in station is at Hoovers Marina in Nanticoke. The Derby takes place in Ontario waters within the Haldimand County boarders. We made a decision to increase the payout this year and in order to cover that, we increased the entry fee to $10.00 1st place (largest bass by weight) - $750.00 2nd place ( 2nd largest by weight) - $500.00 3rd place ( 3rd largest by weight) - $250.00 See the reverse side of ticket for all the derby rules. All Ontario Fishing Regulations are to be followed as well. There is also a draw at the end of the derby (5:00pm Sunday - Austin Park) for all ticket holders, for a number of prizes. Attendance is not necessary.  Hope to see you on the lake this weekend.  cheers, Steve"
