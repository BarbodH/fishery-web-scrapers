Also wondering what price  point I would be in? As the london boat show is this weekend and was thinking of picking up something up if it is a fair deal.  CHEERS Matt "
769065,BucktownAngler,2013-02-20 17:22:00,582,"pretty sure all current boat seats are made to last, and not rot/stink  BPS has a lot  also pretty sure this falls under fishing related topic"
769072,Loonietoon,2013-02-20 17:51:00,1450,"Hi  Matt, I have 2 that are plastic with bench mounts that I am going to sell for $60.00 for the pair if interested.."
769140,Jer,2013-02-20 22:09:00,1426,"I just picked up a couple of these http://www.basspro.com/Tempress-Navistyle-Boat-Seat-HiBack-or-LoBack/product/30333/ , the low-back version, at Bass Pro a couple months ago. Looked to be the best built and most comfy of what they had there. I think they were $115 each. I don't have them in the boat yet obviously, so I can't comment any further."
