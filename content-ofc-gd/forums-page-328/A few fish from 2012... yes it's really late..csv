768670,Locnar,2013-02-18 23:04:00,645,"Thanks fellas. Tayzak, I try to change it up as much as possible... However, there are no trouts... I caught 2 13inch rainbows from a little pond... but no pics... and I don't really consider it ""Trout"" fishing. I'd like to catch some from the creeks n rivers... but have had no luck ever."
768672,Tayzak15,2013-02-18 23:14:00,318,"Ahh thats unfortunate haha, Im from up north so we get all kinds of different trout, sturgeon, walleye, pike perch, and smallmouths. Id love it if we had largies, bullheads and musky where i was from."
