Son and daughter were moving into a new place this weekend. All was planned, arranged, etc....  Daughter winds up back in hospital for treatment.. Being a stubborn child ( don't know where she gets it  ), she never let on she was in difficulties again.  Got a message on moving day  that she had been admitted the day before.  Needless to say, all was chaos, much of the daughter's stuff had not been packed yet. 10 pm Friday night, and 100+ round trips on 4 flights of steps we vacate the old apartment. At the other end , the young fellas just piled everything into the middle of her bedroom and the kitchen. Yesterday was used to recover from overdoing things and the 2 spills.   Apparently I'm not supposed to be climbing all them stairs. Today was the start of sorting out my daughters furniture and things, a mercy run to the hospital with some necessities, and 5 loads of the daughter's laundry. Tommorrow I'll tackle some more of the mountain and some repairs. The Mrs tries to help, but the right arm is tied to a sling for the next 6 weeks to recover from surgery. What else could go wrong?  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zgx3TCnIH80    "
