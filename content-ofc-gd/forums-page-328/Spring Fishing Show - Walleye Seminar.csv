I learned a lot at the Seminar.  It was much better than any tank seminar - in fact the best seminar I've ever been too.  There was a brief introduction, but most of the seminar was based specifically around questions from the audience.  We got to ask specific questions and get responses from three Walleye Masters.  Just writing that, I almost can't believe I got to do it.  It was almost like watching a fishing show, but being able to ask them anything you would like to know.  Afterward, they made themselves available for 1:1 discussion.  The show was worth the entrance fee just for this seminar alone.  I was on the fence between going to the Walleye vs. Bass.  Chose Walleye to get a chance to speak with Gord and I'm glad I did.  I would be interested to hear how the Bass Seminar went."

768976,Rattletrap2,2013-02-20 02:10:00,1652,I attended a general seminar with James Lindner and it was very good as well. He was on for a whole hour and answered a lot of questions at this one as well. I too felt this was worth my admission price. Gord Pyzers level of knowledge is also hard to beat.
