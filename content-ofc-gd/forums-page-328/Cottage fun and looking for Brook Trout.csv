768656,chris.brock,2013-02-18 22:08:00,4053,"No trail pass required on Family Day weekend. We hit the trails for 3 hours on Saturday, me, my wife, Jeff and Crissy. The Bravo left something to be desired on the faster, rail line trail. My wife rode the Phazer, I was stylin' on the trapper    Sunday, me and my Dad went looking for brookies. We had to do alot of monkeying around to get to the lake. I had never fished this lake before, through the ice, or in a canoe.    fire in a dead tree    My Dad did catch 1 brookie (no picture), but the effort needed to get to the lake wasn't justified. We should have brought snow shoes, but didn't. After getting the snowmobile as close as possible,the almost 1 km of crawling through waist deep snow and soft bogs nearly killed us, the cold wind didn't help either. I always say, even after only a 1 fish day, I always have to try/ explore new lakes, always looking for that diamond in the rough, still a great day  .  We did some snow shoeing on Sunday.    The Queen Eliz. Wildlands PP is a great area for snow shoeing, lots of animal tracks in the fresh snow    Another fun weekend in Haliburton. February is one of my favorite months. Longer days, lots of sun, and good snow and ice.  "

768687,chris.brock,2013-02-19 01:00:00,4053," we didn't have much slush, just a little, although I did hear from a guy in the same area that did have trouble with deep slush"
768689,chris.brock,2013-02-19 01:02:00,4053," yeah, the sweaty clothes from getting into the lake, really kill ya when you're standing around, watching tip-ups in - 12 temps and wind"
768969,Moosebunk,2013-02-20 01:57:00,3970,"Lacking a few fish, the pics still did that winter wonderland some justice.  Fun playing over the weekend... and yes, the Trapper Bravo is the most stylin' and reliable of all machines."
