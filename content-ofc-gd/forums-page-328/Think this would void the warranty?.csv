768793,TJQ,2013-02-19 15:14:00,7806,I didn't know sharks had warranties??
768862,SirCranksalot,2013-02-19 20:04:00,3291,"Don't see why, unless catching certain types of fish(e.g. sharks) are excluded from warranty. No a killer whale would be a different story!!"
768876,Rod Caster,2013-02-19 21:07:00,5784,does the warranty cover Act of Shark?
