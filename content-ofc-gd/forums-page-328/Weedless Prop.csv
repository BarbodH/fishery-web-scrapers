I fish on Pigeon lake where there is a lot of wild rice and it wraps around the prop so much that I  contemplate giving up for the day. Do the 2 blade weedless prop make that much of a difference keeping in mind that it is grassy wild rice that is the problem...not cabbage.
767649,Jer,2013-02-14 00:24:00,1426,The two blade will help...but it really comes down to power.
767652,workwear,2013-02-14 00:48:00,592,i have a 101 lbs thrust and still get all bound up on occasion....ive tried 2 blade and 3 blade...2 is not that much better...
767656,nancur373,2013-02-14 01:04:00,1211,Don`t think I have to worry there. It`s only a 15` tinny. On max setting it will almost twist off the bow of the boat.lol. always be sure to remember to have the arrow pointing forward when starting or you get wet...lol
767662,workwear,2013-02-14 01:18:00,592,ya ive had a few laughs with my motor...totally by accident hitting the thrust button while the motor is pointing the wrong way....lol...a few guys have gone over board...
767700,Nipfisher,2013-02-14 02:55:00,2449,Helps a bit if you raise the prop to just under the surface. You lose control and power but keeps some of the weeds off.
767701,nancur373,2013-02-14 03:00:00,1211,that's where it is
767707,fish_fishburn,2013-02-14 03:16:00,1311,"Raising the prop helps a bit, but not to much that it cavitiates and scares the fish. If I remember, the night before that I am going to be fishing slop, I will get a small flat file and sharpen the prop edge. Suprisingly how sharp you can get it as well as filing any nicks off the edge. This helps until you wack a big stick or a stone. I have found the 2 blade to be pretty useless. Not worth the pull you lose. If i'm not mistaken the prop I am using on my Motorguide is a Ninja prop."

Last year i bought a fortrex 80lb with the gen2 weedless blade, thats the one with the little winglets on the blade to push the weeds away from the prop, and WOW WHAT A DIFFERENCE!!! i dont think i honestly got cought up once. And i pushed it through some serious grass. I would recommend that prop to every bass fisherman. Never looked into it but i already heard of guys somehow rigging these props on a motorguide... Its quite a bit of work but must be worth it if the guys are going through all that trouble to get it on."
