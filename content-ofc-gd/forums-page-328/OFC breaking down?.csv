768221,TJQ,2013-02-16 15:31:00,7806,I havent noticed any 404 issues... anyone????
768224,danbouck,2013-02-16 15:36:00,4380,Nope
768225,ccmtcanada,2013-02-16 15:40:00,7971,All fine on my pc and iPhone.  Never received the page not found error.
768226,misfish,2013-02-16 15:42:00,29133,"You got trouble. Last time I had that,it was new pc time. Huge virus."
768231,Rich Clemens,2013-02-16 15:51:00,3131,Nope - nothing down here.
768232,Christopheraaron,2013-02-16 16:01:00,3525,"Nope, runs fine on the iphone and mac"

768237,esoxansteel,2013-02-16 16:22:00,1307,"Alls fine here, did see some 404s previous to the last updates, but none since"
768239,Hooked,2013-02-16 16:25:00,891,All fine here as well.  You might want to clear your Internet cache and\or try a different browser.  Wouldn't hurt to run a virus\malware check either.
768241,lew,2013-02-16 16:28:00,12766," Jeez, I hope my mini rant didn't bust OFC"
768246,BillM,2013-02-16 16:37:00,17367,"BigUgli, you can probably blame your ISP's DNS servers for the 404 errors.  I know that I was having issues with Rogers a few weeks back.  If you know how, add the Google DNS servers to your routers Primary and Secondary DNS lookup list.  DNS #1 8.8.8.8 DNS #2 8.8.4.4"
