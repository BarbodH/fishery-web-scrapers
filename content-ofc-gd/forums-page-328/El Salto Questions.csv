If you can tell me if a canoe can be rented by the day? If it is safe?  Also, does someone know if you can take a few rods and tackle on a plane?  I am going to call my travel agent but I think it may be a good idea to ask fisherman as well.   Thank you,   "

I've  taken fly gear so the rod, reel and all gear fit into my checked luggage fine. I've never had an issue. However fly rods break down small enough to do this, most others will not, unless you've got a travel spinning rod.  For larger gear I'd call the agent or airline you'd be flying with to find out the specifics. I'm sure you'll be allowed to take them, but likely have to pay for a second piece of checked luggage, same as when guys take golf clubs. And you'll want to make sure you've got a strong rod case to pack them in."
