768690,boombap,2013-02-19 01:07:00,310,"So I was organizing some tackle tonight and realized that quite a few of my heddon top waters (zara spook, jitterbug, hula popper) are rusted out at the hooks. Most of these were purchased last summer and saw the water a max of 5 times.  Am I the only one having bad luck with heddon?"
768695,kickingfrog,2013-02-19 01:12:00,8333,I haven't noticed a particular brand but more just rust in general on hooks and what not. I try to always open up my lure cases after each trip and if it was raining I'll even run a fan over the open trays to help with air circulation.
768696,Roy,2013-02-19 01:15:00,13728,What happens to a lot of topwaters is that water gets inside of them and when they appear to be dry are thrown in the tackle box and that's where they stay to rust out.

768762,mike rousseau,2013-02-19 05:29:00,4661,I hang my lures in the boat at the end of the day... The 10-15 minute drive home dries em off pretty well.... Then they go in the box..
768783,kemper,2013-02-19 14:31:00,2232,"I have a whole box of spooks in various sizes, none of them are rusted at all and I don't do anything special with them. They get used hard and chucked back into the box after use with no special treatment."
769031,boombap,2013-02-20 13:11:00,310,"So im doing something wrong then.. its weird tho, it only happens with my heddons.  Is there anything I can add to a plano tray that might help absorb some moisture? Besides paper towels."
769061,richyb,2013-02-20 16:54:00,774,you didnt happen to put a salted tube jig in the tray with them? I left one in my ice box beside a williams over the summer.
769196,Sinker,2013-02-21 00:24:00,8692,"Rust sucks!  I hang all my gear after using it, and all my tackle trays sit open in the garage. I'm tired of wasting big money on tackle, only to let it rust. I also replace most of my hooks with red ones, they don't rust.  S."
