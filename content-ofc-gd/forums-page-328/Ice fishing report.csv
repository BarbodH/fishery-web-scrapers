768070,Garfisher,2013-02-15 19:34:00,229,"Just came back from 3rd Year Fish and Wildlife Field Camp, and plenty of ice fishing was to be had at the hunt camp we stayed at for the week. I only fished the main lake, which is stocked with Rainbows and has a small self-sustaining population of Brookies, however other classmates also fished another smaller lake on the property that were stocked with Brookies. Managed to catch 5 Rainbows and a bonus/rare 17"" Brookie (totally unexpected considering we only caught one during sampling at fall camp using Fyke nets), and managed to catch the biggest Brook Trout of the week. I held big fish honours for all of 5 minutes with my biggest Rainbow (2nd fish in the pics below, 20.75"" long) before my friend caught one that we estimated at approximately 22"". All fish were caught on a light power ice rod with 4lb Fireline Crystal, and the lure of choice was a Powerbait Micro Nymph on a 1/8oz Lunker City Fin-S Fish Head (or whatever those jigheads are called).

768187,Acountdeleted,2013-02-16 09:20:00,2562,"Heh. Yep, I do recognize that lake. Same one as when I took 3rd year fish. Does fleming still stock the back ponds with brookies? Also did Dave Preslie tell you any interesting stories about poop?"
768216,Garfisher,2013-02-16 15:12:00,229,"Yes and yes. Preslie also tried ice fishing but John Knight's dogs decided to play keep away with his gloves, worms, and his ice stick or whatever he was using lol"
