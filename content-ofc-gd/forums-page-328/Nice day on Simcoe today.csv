768494,Joey,2013-02-17 22:17:00,9122,"Had a nice day on Simcoe today.  Terry met us this morning and we headed out to a few fave spots.  The travel was the pits with lots of ruts from 4 wheelers in the slush that had frozen up.  Made for slow going and took the sliders off of Paul's hut  Here's Terry's set up:        Here's Paul's new hut.  Very roomy inside, wish I had taken a pic of the inside        I was nice and comfy in my little hut        Had lots of action, but hardly any takers.  I finally landed a nice one, and it was the only one landed of the day.  I was pretty happy        And I caught it using one of TJ's jigheads from his store, so I bet he will be happy.  Too bad my camera decided to freeze up on me.      Anyhow, we fished til 2 p.m. and had several on and off, but just the one for the day.  Looking forward to next weekend out there.  Hope the ice conditions are a bit better, but it was at least thick enough now!  Great company once again Terry, hope to see you next weekend"

768499,davey buoy,2013-02-17 22:27:00,5505,Still looked like a fun day!Nice fish and that hut of yours is nice. After yesterday a portable hut is defineatly in the near future.
768500,irishfield,2013-02-17 22:37:00,26272,Terry was with you.. something got broken.. and you're surprised???
768502,Terry,2013-02-17 22:43:00,14456,"   hey, I resemble that ...  was a good time but one heck of a ride....my back needs a little R&R....  oh and no dead whitefish were seen on my underwater camera...some people are saying hundreds of dead whities from vhs..."
768503,Joey,2013-02-17 22:53:00,9122,"Yes, trout for supper Roy  Davey buoy, they are a lifesaver on days like today.  I used to love fishing outside, but you can stay out much longer in a heated hut.  We use our walkie talkies to converse.  Wayne, I never thought of that   Ya, my back is done too Terry, time for a nap I think"
768504,RickOnt,2013-02-17 22:56:00,669,"The perfect size Laker for the B- B- Q, right there,  Looks like the Slush has tightened up!!  I guess you can blame me for some of those 4 wheeler ruts!!!  Pauls hut looks fantastic!! He should try some UHMW Plastic for runners.  Terry aka 'Columbo' Good news re no dead Whities"
768506,Joey,2013-02-17 23:01:00,9122,"Came in at 25 inches Rick.  I'm sure Paul will read your comment on the sliders, thanks!!  Oh, and yes, thanks for the ruts  #&$@"
