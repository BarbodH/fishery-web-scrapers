769176,Dan668,2013-02-20 23:47:00,1120,Looking to purchase my first flasher. Was going to make my hds portable but decided to scrap that idea. Has anyone here had any experience with this model? Ideally the lx6 would be a better fit. But it's not upgradable. Reedsports in the states has an awesome price on the unit. Just have to figure out how I'm going to get it.  Thanks
