768841,icefisherman,2013-02-19 18:42:00,952,Where can I find a replacement battery for my MarCum flasher. The original one was 7Ah but I'd like to replace it with 9Ah this time. It is 12V batery. Somewhere locally in West GTA would be great so I can pick it up. Thanks.

768849,icefisherman,2013-02-19 19:06:00,952,Thanks Roy. Actually those guys would be perfect for pick up...but when I called them a minute ago they told me they only have the 7.5Ah and the 12Ah....not the 9Ah... 12Ah would be too big size wise and it will not fit at the back of the flasher ...and I want to move up from the 7.5Ah....so no luck with them.... Thanks.
768851,Meegs,2013-02-19 19:27:00,249,"Emil, you should have said something last week.  I think its total battery on dunlop st barrie had afew in stock, just  mine for 25 bucks. I can always pick.one up for you when I fly home in afew weeks, cant do much here in manitoba "
768853,Cosmos,2013-02-19 19:35:00,588,I picked up mine from Radioworld. Was around $45 for 9 amp/hours.
768855,icefisherman,2013-02-19 19:44:00,952," Thanks James. Yes I've read somewhere about some place in Barrie and I guess this is the one...I was trying up until last night to figure out is it the battery or the charger...spoke to MarCum and when they heard it is my original battery and my unit is probably the first LX5 that came to Canada the guy immediately said it is the battery. Found few places selling them cheap but when you add shipping it kills the deal. If I don't find anything until your next trip back home I'll let you know and get one from Barrie. Stay warm up there  Cheers, Ice Fisherman"
768857,davey buoy,2013-02-19 19:48:00,5505,That's where I bought my 7.5. Great people and good pricing.
768863,pics,2013-02-19 20:05:00,1268,Acme battery in Hamilton also has decent prices..... My marcum has issues with the battery gauge not allowing a charge through it. When I hook the battery directly to the charger it works fine...

768869,icefisherman,2013-02-19 20:34:00,952,"OK,  spoke to the place in Barrie....they quoted me $32.80 for the 9Ah...James probably got the 7Ah for $25... Also spoke to the place in Hamilton (Acme) - thanks pics....they quoted me $28 + $6 shipping to me (not bad)...and also told me I can get it closer to home from a place in Mississauga called Battery Boys (close to Dixie and 401). Called them and they quoted me $32.95 but when I mentioned that Acme has referred me to them they agreed to sell it to me for the same $28 same as Acme, if I stop by...very good service from all places by the way...so I'll stop by in the next couple days and get it from Battery Boys in Mississauga so I can charge it fully and be ready for my next ice trip.  http://bbmbattery.com/ps-series-general-purpose-batteries/2654-ps-1290-12v-9ah-battery-canada.html  Thanks again to all for the info. Hope what I found helps others as well.  Cheers, Ice Fisherman"
768874,davey buoy,2013-02-19 21:01:00,5505,Battery should be fully charged when you get it. If you don't have a proper charger you'll need one as well.
768921,Fang,2013-02-19 23:23:00,1330,Magnacharge in misissauga sells them to. I run a 12ah from them no problems
768923,porkpie,2013-02-19 23:26:00,2521,"I bought my marcum in December 2005.  The battery still functions great and holds a charge.  I can't believe it myself!  I don't know what kind of battery they shipped them with, but they are awesome.  I thought mine was an anomaly until hearing that your just replacing your battery now."
768940,icefisherman,2013-02-20 00:33:00,952,"Yep mine was great as well from new until now...but there is an end to everything I guess ;-) So the time has come to replace mine...and decided to do it with a 9Ah one instead of 7Ah that came with the unit. Hope you get some extra time out of yours.  Cheers, Ice Fisherman"
768991,nancur373,2013-02-20 02:51:00,1211,What Roy said...Check out the store he said in person as they have a ton of stuff and also there is another store in the same plaza. Go check them out.
768992,irishfield,2013-02-20 02:52:00,26272,..and here I thought you were in the security biz Emil... do you not have any batteries??
768999,icefisherman,2013-02-20 03:18:00,952,"Not that kind of security and not that kind of batteries Wayne ;-)  Cheers, Ice Fisherman"
