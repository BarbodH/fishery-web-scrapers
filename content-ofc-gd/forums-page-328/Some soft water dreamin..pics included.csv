Its only a small bunch mostly of my little lakex and Wellers Bay. In the summer I fish Stoney, Buckhorn, LoveSick (havent had much luck), BuckHorn, Jack and a few others quite a bit from a friends boat. I like that group of lakes up there  Hope you guys and gals enjoy. p.s if anyone reconizes the non Wellers Bay pics could you please keep the whereabouts to youselfs. 2 pics of Piggy I caught last summer:  Average Largie:  another:  The lightning rod..ok maybe not. 5hp Nissan 2 stroke bolted to a portabote.

769077,Tim Mills,2013-02-20 18:01:00,476,"Pidge- enjoyed the pics,  How heavy was piggy and what are your thoughts on the portaboat?"
769087,pidge,2013-02-20 19:16:00,438,"Just for you T.J. lol (Wellers Bay) Thanks Mercman and FinesseFan. Left the scale at home so no weight or lenght  But I can tell you that is now my PB. Actually about a miniut earlier I caught his smaller brother which was a hair smaller than the pictured one. On the PortaBote its not bad I guess, actually bought it used off a member on this board in 2008 (Thanks Nel if read this and are still a member). I wouldnt take it out on Simcoe or big bodies like that, but for my little back lake spots its great I find. I use to have a trolling motor, but decided to buy a used Nissan 5hp with the tank built into the top of the motor. Its weird cause id say most times it seems like the nose of the boat wants to dive at full throttle, and then sometimes it dosent, but havent figured it out yet..Any ideas? Ive played with the angle and I swear I had it fixed. Another time out it did it again and just left well alone. Its not exactly a speed boat I just enjoy the slower pace. But yeah back to the boat Its comfotable for two for sure and thats all I've had on it, and has decent room for a small cooler, extra rods, tackle bags so on and so on. Setup isnt to bad. It helps to have two people, but it can be done with one. I cant think of any thing else to say about it, but if youve got any other questions feel free to ask."

769161,Locnar,2013-02-20 23:09:00,645,"That bass is a friggin hog! Very impressive. I, too, am dying for some soft water summer fishin! I do enjoy ice fishing, but winter is becoming tiresome."
769175,NAW,2013-02-20 23:46:00,4022,Nice pics man!  But I'm still in hard water mode.  I'm no where near ready for soft water yet!!
769213,Rod Caster,2013-02-21 01:06:00,5784,"x2. Still, that top bass stirs up some good emotions! Amazing fish."
769243,pidge,2013-02-21 02:31:00,438,Thanks guys. Took all summer to catch that one.
