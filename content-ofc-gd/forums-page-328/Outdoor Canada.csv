768904,BillM,2013-02-19 22:31:00,17367,Is it still the ice fishing issue or did a new spring one hit the shelves?
768909,kickingfrog,2013-02-19 22:51:00,8333,"It's the ""Special Fishing Issue"" with the usual stuff: ""X"" number of hotspots. Catch big fish. Top secret spots. Fishing show host on cover. Et cetera."
768910,BillM,2013-02-19 22:52:00,17367,I think I saw that one in Zehrs the other day..
768960,Moosebunk,2013-02-20 01:46:00,3970,"Just finished it.  Time to renew... or not..?  The article on Henry was interesting.  Fins & Skins, not me... but Fishing the Flats I'll enjoy from time to time.  He's done well to continue on in the industry, whether liked or not, he does have determination."
768980,reelinrolly,2013-02-20 02:16:00,281,Just read the article on Henry. Really enjoyed it. Firm believer in second chances. Says something about his work ethic coming back from such a bad public relations fiasco.  I like how the article showed the business end of things as well

769049,torco,2013-02-20 14:58:00,656,Yes determied but I have on good account that from a business relationship best to steer clear of him and his show.
