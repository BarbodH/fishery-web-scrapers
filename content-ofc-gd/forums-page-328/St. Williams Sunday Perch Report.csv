Used a micro jig with a Perch eye and also used a Buckshot that caught some of the bigger ones. Ice was bare and made pulling the clam out a breeze."
768771,Nipfisher,2013-02-19 13:25:00,2449,Some well fed perch right there.

768906,Spiel,2013-02-19 22:36:00,9065,Where's my whitefish?
769081,rob v,2013-02-20 18:26:00,535,Like someone else posted earlier - how long a walk would that be ?
769198,FisherJuli,2013-02-21 00:27:00,125,Maybe next time I can catch something more like that on LPB!! They look delicious!!!

769272,Fish Farmer,2013-02-21 13:10:00,2234,"Rob, I would say about 1 KM and the ice was good for walking, cleats were a must. Good luck if you get out."
769281,Roy,2013-02-21 13:53:00,13728,"A great day out for you, Dave. Congrats and thanks for sharing."
