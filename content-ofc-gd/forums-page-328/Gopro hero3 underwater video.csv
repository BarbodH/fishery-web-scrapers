768881,Terry,2013-02-19 21:31:00,14456,"this is a video from the same spot at the same time as the others, but with my regular  underwater camera and recorded on my monitor/recorder  "
768892,misfish,2013-02-19 22:15:00,29133,"At 59 sec. I seen da wabbit.LOL  This is why you dont catch fish bud.LOL  Real cool vids,and I cant beleive the clearness at those depths. Guess those zebras are doing this."
768894,misfish,2013-02-19 22:17:00,29133,We need to get something rigged up for the pools at the river. Now that would be cool to see. Would help avoiding those snags you get.
768895,kickingfrog,2013-02-19 22:18:00,8333,Maybe the two of you could team up and host a show.
768899,misfish,2013-02-19 22:27:00,29133," Na,Terrys to serious."
768907,kickingfrog,2013-02-19 22:46:00,8333,And Johnny had Ed.  Yin and Yang.
768919,Terry,2013-02-19 23:19:00,14456,"no, I sweep and wash the bottom before I do a video..I like it to look nice  just like wearing the right shirt while fishing"
768569,Terry,2013-02-18 12:14:00,14456,I was surprised how bright and clearly I could see at 104ft with a ft of ice and snow cover on lake simcoe  you can see the clumps of zebra mussels half way through I turned the lights on for a  second but it doesn't help in any way  gopro hero3 works pretty well.   
768570,fishindevil,2013-02-18 12:23:00,6254,Looks pretty good actually !!!! Thanks for sharing !!! I'm gonna try mine this spring in the Ottawa river !!!! Cheers
768574,Roy,2013-02-18 12:42:00,13728,Very impressive Terry.
768575,Jimmay,2013-02-18 12:49:00,4,That is very good.  What hero 3 model are you using?
768577,Terry,2013-02-18 13:02:00,14456,black
768579,Jimmay,2013-02-18 13:07:00,4,thanks. great quality.  I want one now.
768587,Handlebarz,2013-02-18 13:40:00,3790,Nice Terry I am looking into getting one or two of them for this year I like the wifi feature and that is the thing I want them for the most.
768591,chris f.,2013-02-18 14:03:00,95,"hey guys, i've been having issue's with my polaroid underwater camcorder ( sound sucks after being immersed and had to put tape over the mic to stop it )  now i'm looking at the gopro's, and it tooks like the white, silver and black all have WiFi ?  does one have better WiFi than the others? the website doesn't give much info... thanks for any input"
768592,limeyangler,2013-02-18 14:12:00,5204,"Hey Terry, any chance we get a pic/detail  of your set up?   Cuz that is awesome!   Were you able to control it with the wifi at that depth?  Were you using the phone app so you can watch live?   Thanks Simon."
768599,Terry,2013-02-18 14:48:00,14456,"all 3 hero3s have wifi,I think only the black comes with the remote   I can not control it with the wifi underwater, I hve not tried shallow it might work I just turn it on and record I can see what I am recording on my monitor for the other camera  here is my regular  underwater  camera  with pan and lights and lots of cable     and here is it with my hero3 mounted on it   "
768601,Handlebarz,2013-02-18 14:58:00,3790,Hey terry if you could please try the remote with the camera about 2'-3' under the water as I want to remotely turn mine in and off beside the boat that would be awesome.  What light did you use gopro or the other camera?  Thanks mike
768602,Terry,2013-02-18 15:05:00,14456,I will the next time I'm out   My regular underwater camera has a bank of lights I can turn on and off but the water around here has so much zoo plantation and what not the lights don't help
768608,BFSC Kevin,2013-02-18 15:52:00,1351,The wifi doesn't work when the camera is in water.
768609,Handlebarz,2013-02-18 15:56:00,3790,Dang Kevin that sucks as I had plans for that to d ounderwater footage and not have it running all day. On the bright side I can just get the hero 2 for underwater shots and leave it on all day I guess. Thanks for the info the same.
768610,BFSC Kevin,2013-02-18 15:59:00,1351,I wanted to use my gopro as a underwater camera in conjunction with my iPhone as the screen. I was really bummed when I found out that wifi doesn't work through water.
768611,kickingfrog,2013-02-18 16:04:00,8333,"Ya, just like trying the highbeams when it is snowing.  Thanks for taking the time to shoot and post these Terry."
768612,kickingfrog,2013-02-18 16:06:00,8333,But have you tried sticking your phone in the water at the same time?
768614,Luke V.,2013-02-18 16:34:00,286,Surprisingly the iPhone takes pretty good under water footage All u need is a life proof case. Well worth the investment for me
768615,Joey,2013-02-18 16:36:00,9122,"Wow, very cool video Terry.  I'm surprised how much light is down there too at that depth.  I'm also surprised how calm it looks.   Doesn't seem to have as much current as I thought!"
768621,limeyangler,2013-02-18 17:13:00,5204,Thanks Terry.....that is wicked.  So the footage you have has no lights on whatsoever?  I'm with Joey.....that's amazing how much light there is down that deep....you sure the infra red lights on your regular cmera are not on???   Thanks for taking the time to show us that.
768628,Terry,2013-02-18 17:55:00,14456,"no lights in 104 ft of water if you pause the first video at 50 seconds you will see what the lights do, only had them on for a second or 2"
768808,Terry,2013-02-19 16:11:00,14456,I rechecked and all lights including ir were off
768812,BillM,2013-02-19 16:20:00,17367,"Terry, that's crazy for 104ft!!  Awesome video man!"
768829,Jon,2013-02-19 17:43:00,209,"Terry:  What do you use for your monitor on your other camera? Does it have a recording option?  Thanks in advance,  Jon"
768854,Terry,2013-02-19 19:42:00,14456,yes it records jxd990 http://www.dhgate.com/portable-jxd-990-720p-tv-in-dv-dc-tv-out/p-ff808081374f8c8701375de7e51b27ef.html
