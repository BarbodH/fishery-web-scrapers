769113,BillM,2013-02-20 20:29:00,17367,Looks like the Sabres fired Ruff.  Bring back Teddy Nolan!  lol  http://www.cbssports.com/nhl/blog/eye-on-hockey/21736782/struggling-buffalo-sabres-fire-lindy-ruff-longesttenured-coach-in-nhl
769114,davey buoy,2013-02-20 20:34:00,5505,I never really new why he (Ted) never made it as a respected coach?. Trying to remember why that didn't happen.
769117,BillM,2013-02-20 20:44:00,17367,"Blame Muckler and the fact that he's native (ie people didn't want him him that position).  Some might not like my answer, but if someone has a better answer, feel free to post it.  I'd love to see him back behind the bench for any NHL team."
769121,solopaddler,2013-02-20 20:58:00,8605,"I'm sure he won't be unemployed for long. Smacks of desperation to me, but then sometimes change for the sake of change can be good.  The bigger question with that team is Miller. He needs to keep his mouth shut and play the game or he'll be the next one gone."
769122,davey buoy,2013-02-20 21:00:00,5505,"He's far to vocal,and calling out the team can't be good for the long term I would think."
769123,fish_fishburn,2013-02-20 21:07:00,1311,"I think Nolan was a great coach, and was well respected by his players. Miller is a goof."
769124,BillM,2013-02-20 21:07:00,17367,"Agreed, Miller whines more then any other goalie in the NHL."
769133,kickingfrog,2013-02-20 21:45:00,8333,"The sports talk radio today was suggesting that the Leafs/Sabres game Thursday was a make or break game for Lindy.  Sometimes a coach just has to be changed because you can't fire the whole team, or half. Lindy has been, and still will be, paid well so no need for a tag day for him either. He'll be working again very soon."
769135,blaque,2013-02-20 21:49:00,2419,"Alot of people here were soured on millers verbal diarreah last season and prior. But i can tell you that after his rant post penguins game this past weekend,,,,,,alot of fans actually took it for what it was worth and supported his comments. Feeling it was good to see a player actually showing frustration and quite frankly, i agree. It was good to see him call some guys out. i get sick and tired of the same old pominville robot post game comments. ""We gotta be better"" or ""thats just not good enough"".  Im sad to see lindy go as i wanted a"" buffalo guy"" to win it here someday, but it was loooooooong overdue and proven that he wasnt going to be that guy. Glad they let him go, but sorry it had to come to that  As far as Nolan......this city LOVED that guy. Dominik Hasek however........didnt exactly have a warm and fuzzy relationship with him. His wife on the other hand..........that may or may not be a different story lol"
769137,otter649,2013-02-20 22:03:00,118,Since Lindy Ruff was hired as Buffalo's head coach - 170 NHL head coaches were changed/fired.....
769138,DRIFTER_016,2013-02-20 22:06:00,10439,They offered me the position but said I had to move to Buffalo and that was a deal breaker!!!!
769145,kickingfrog,2013-02-20 22:18:00,8333,I guess I haven't been paying attention. Someone hasn't been around here for a while it seems?
769203,bow slayer,2013-02-21 00:41:00,1074,"Well the story I have heard a few times about Nolan was he went behind Muckler's back to higher  management over a issue he and muckler did not agree on. There is a reason why no one else(other then the islanders) have gave him a another shot,and it has nothing to do with him being native."
