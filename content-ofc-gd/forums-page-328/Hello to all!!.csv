769018,mcdougy,2013-02-20 04:46:00,274,"I believe it is important to introduce myself and say hello to everyone!!  I am a country boy living in london ontario with a wife and 3 kids(16 f, 10 m, 5 m).  I am a carpenter by trade and selfemployed  for  the last 18yrs  as a smallcontractor.I have  always been  a outdoor person. I like to hunt deer and moose, atv, sled, white water canoe, camp, and obviously have a interest  to fish. Most fishinghappens in a 5acre family owned pond with bass and perch.  Last fall I decided that the 2 boys and wife were showing enough interest and really enjoying the fishing enough to buy a small boat. i had purchased a 15  2stroke yamaha earlier in the summer because of a few hunt camp mishaps of the boys"" rolling the dice"" on old unreliable junk motors they find for $200 and  leave you strandedfor hours on shore. I cannot and will not ""roll"" like that. so kijji found me this 1999 15h.p. that was at least 20yrs newer than anything they  were willing to supply. (whew...glad I got that off my chest)So anyways, i bought of kijji again, a 2007 14ft starcaft with a sweet layout and floor and live well.  The size of boat and set-up i had always dreamed of owning one day.  I plan on learning alot about fishing here, because I truly only know the basics. (pole, bait, and laughter).  I appreciate all info provided from most people and have a good sense of humour.  I'm not sure how I can contribute for others but will offer my opinion on  something that I believe to be accurate.  Thanks and  CHEERS Matt"
