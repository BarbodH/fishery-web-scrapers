1081195,akaShag,2022-07-18 19:25:00,2073,"My wife can hear a mouse fart.  I can hear jet engines and 12 gauge shells firing perfectly fine.  So the ""CLICK"" probably happened, but I certainly did not hear it.  But (using the cheaters) I could see that it stuck where it was supposed to stick.  I think. We'll see tomorrow if this gizmo works like it is designed to do...........please wish me luck! Doug"
1081196,BillM,2022-07-18 19:34:00,17367,"You can power the unit up without being in the water, once it's on hit the power button, scroll up to 'sonar' and make sure it's off.  Then you can mess around with the unit without worrying about your transducer heating up from being out of the water.    This way you can test everything beforehand."
1081197,akaShag,2022-07-18 19:40:00,2073,"I REALLY appreciate this advice, and THANKS so much!"
1081215,akaShag,2022-07-20 15:14:00,2073,"So, on day 32 of bass season (yesterday) I finally got out for bass for the first time this year.  A BC trip, and then covid, played hell with the first 31 days....  I love my new Alumacraft, I love my Yamaha, and I am happy I decided to sell my old boat and buy a new rig.  The Terrova motor has plenty of power for my needs, and the deploy/stow assist gizmo is a back saver for sure.  The foot pedal, however, is not at all intuitive.  Press down at the toe, it turns the head right, down on the heel turns it left.  More pressure is needed on the heel than the toe.  The ""gas pedal"" is top left and fairly small.  So pretty near every time I just wanted power, the motor head would turn to the right and I might or not get power.  No question of watching where I am fishing and just using the pedal by feel (as in my old boat).  I have to LOOK AT the pedal every single time, and ignore my line.  Much of my fishing is watching my line for any signs of a bite, since most bass takes are pretty subtle (on jigs, plastic worms, etc which I use 95% of the time) so I probably missed some fish because of farting around with the foot pedal. And what about that graph, to get back on topic.........it seems to work just fine but I definitely need more time playing with it to get the best use out of it.  And it is mounted at the stern of my tiller boat, not at the bow where I spent most of my time yesterday morning. And I landed nine bass, all largemouth, in a bit less than 3 hours, so the fishing was pretty decent too! Thanks for all the advice, folks, it is much appreciated!"
1081217,AKRISONER,2022-07-20 15:21:00,5558,"You will learn to use the pedal, do not give up on it. eventually it will become such an extension of your body that the speed of the terrova electric steering won’t be fast enough for you. Well that is unless you experience the feeling of a “cable steer feel” motor like a Garmin force. Once you go with that style you can never go back IMO.  "
1081218,akaShag,2022-07-20 16:02:00,2073,"Yes, my old foot pedal was completely ""an extension of my body"" and maybe this one will eventually be that as well.  But this electric will be the last one I buy, unless I have a catastrophic failure/accident with it.  Same for the boat, motor, graph, etc, this rig should do me until I hang up my fishing gear.  And hopefully that will be many a year from now!"
1081235,Freshtrax,2022-07-21 00:07:00,2215,Did you get ipiot?  Assuming you did.   I generaly use mine in auto pilot mode  where it will maintain a heading  helps cut down on the fiddling with the footpedal when working a section of shorline I find the standard a.p.  works better than the advanced for this.
1081236,akaShag,2022-07-21 00:15:00,2073,"Indeed I do, and thanks for this idea.  Some of the shorelines I fish are pretty straight and I think this will work.  Some are pretty irregular.  But yes, anything that keeps my eye on my line is a great idea. Doug"
1081241,AKRISONER,2022-07-21 11:41:00,5558,"Fresh trax’s point is actually so true I just forgot because it’s been a while since I’ve used an electric steer. but truthfully when I had a terrova I spent 90% of my time pointing my boat into the wind, hitting “constant” and then hitting “heading” effectively once you’ve aimed the boat and put the setting on a speed that gets you to crawl into the wind, the boat will literally drive itself.  on really windy days fishing open water I still use this functionality like crazy rather than dancing around on the trolling motor as the wind attempts to throw the boat everywhere. Keeping the boat under power stop the boat from swinging sideways while rolling forward."
1081250,porkpie,2022-07-21 22:42:00,2521,Hold down on the N button until the circle goes away.  Otherwise the motor will jog and occasionally steer in another direction.
1081251,akaShag,2022-07-21 22:56:00,2073,"Is that with the remote?  I have not used it yet, still trying to figure out the foot pedal..."
1081255,porkpie,2022-07-22 02:07:00,2521,Yep on the remote.  Give it a try you’ll like it!
1079343,akaShag,2022-03-23 01:32:00,2073,"I have a new boat coming and will put a new graph on it.  I am NOT a competitive angler, so I don't need all the bells and whistles, PLUS I am an old fart and not a technically-inclined sort of fellow.  🙄 I was following a discussion on here a year or two ago but did not archive it (foolish me!) and so here I am asking for advice that some of you have no doubt provided before.  I have been very much a Lowrance fan for ever (and Eagle, but that's like Chev/GM = same/same), BUT some people whose opinions I value are died-in-the-wool Humminbird fans. I NEED good, accurate depth.  I LIKE a reasonable idea about fish and bait.  Everything else is gravy.  It looks like the HELIX 5 CHIRP GPS G2 is a very decent rig and is priced right at $440 plus tax.  Is that a good choice?  I am thinking GPS and ""CHIRP"" are both useful features, and that appears to be the lowest-end model that has both of those. I would very much value your opinions, and even more your own experiences with relatively new models of graphs.  THANKS! Doug"
1079347,AKRISONER,2022-03-23 02:15:00,5558,"Shag, I’d save yourself a few extra Pennies and get the 7 over the 5. The difference in screen size between the 5 and 7 is about as noticeable as the difference between a 7 and a 12. i found the 5 very difficult the read the GPS off of especially since screens are now always in landscape format. i wish I could sell you my helix 7 g2 chirp gps at a stupid deal but I just realized today that for some reason I can no longer get the transducer to connect to it. if you simply want water temp, gps, and depth you cannot go wrong with a helix 7 chirp gps G2. It’s the lowest price with some of the best imaging on the market. For a guy that’s also looking for a simple unit to use it’s right up there with the best for that application. An added bonus they are extremely simple to convert to and ice fishing flasher if you buy a xi 9 ice transducer! ill add, if you are looking for any help with wiring/getting it set up and dialed, as per my other thread let me know id love to help!"
1079351,akaShag,2022-03-23 11:55:00,2073,THANKS for the advice!  But this unit appears to be discontinued.  And any prices I see for Helix 7 graphs as opposed to Helix 5 graphs appear to cost hundreds of dollars more.  What am I missing here?
1079354,BillM,2022-03-23 13:31:00,17367,Find a used Helix 7/9 G2N.
1079355,Terry,2022-03-23 13:44:00,14456,The older the eyes the bigger the screen needs to be
1079356,AKRISONER,2022-03-23 13:54:00,5558,"You will have a heck of a time reading that 5 inch screen when you are out in the boat. Especially for navigating.   	the 7 will allow you to navigate no problem, I was using a 7 up until last year at my console purely for the gps and had no issues running around the lake at 50mph and reading it."

1079369,BillM,2022-03-23 16:57:00,17367,Awesome!  Super easy to use out of the box.  You'll have fun with it.
1079434,Sinker,2022-03-25 14:37:00,8692,Just turn it on and go. Easy peasy. S.
1081177,akaShag,2022-07-17 19:51:00,2073,"OK so I had the boat in the water back in May for crappies, and not since then.  A trip to BC, and then covid, got in my way.  So far I love the Yamaha, I love the boat, I love spotlock, I HATE the foot pedal, and the graph has been mildly useful but mostly confusing. So packaged with the graph was an SD card from Navionics, and a link to download the charts etc.  I did get that accomplished without too much cussing.  But when I went to stick the SD card into the graph, first of all it took me forever to find the slot (and its chintzy cover) but the freakin hole is for a micro SD card.  Will that itty bitty wafer that come out of the bottom of the SD card work?  It is about 1/2"" by 3/16"" and as thin as a playing card. I have exactly zero idea what to do now.  Can one of you more technical guys please help me out here?  I hope to finally get out for bass this week........ Doug"
1081178,porkpie,2022-07-17 20:03:00,2521,Yes the small card inside the big card will work just fine.  Pop it into the micro SD card slot and you should be good to go!
1081179,akaShag,2022-07-17 20:15:00,2073,"Thanks!  It's so small I hope it only goes in one way, if I put it in backwards it's never coming out of there............ Any idea WHY they would choose to use the micro instead of a standard size SD card?  Trail cameras are a quarter the size of this graph, and they use full-size cards........ Doug"
1081180,porkpie,2022-07-17 20:23:00,2521,Half of my trail cams use micro SD. It should only fit one way.  If you have issues grab the tweezers!
1081181,akaShag,2022-07-17 20:52:00,2073,"I learn something new here just about every time I log in!  I have a dozen trail cams, some of which I leave up year round, and I have had another 8 or maybe 10 over the years.  None of them used the micro cards.  That must be ""interesting"" swapping out those tiny cards in the woods!!!!  I have a hard enough time not dropping the regular cards into the snow or leaves and stuff. Anyways I am going to try to put this little card into the graph tomorrow, stay tuned for more cries for help........😉"
1081182,BillM,2022-07-17 22:10:00,17367,Goes in this way...  
1081183,akaShag,2022-07-17 22:12:00,2073,THANKS!!!
1081186,AKRISONER,2022-07-18 01:14:00,5558,"To get the cards out I’ve honestly resorted to using a knife to poke the ridge on them. The card will actually make an audible click noise when it gets pushed into the slot. Don’t push too hard, just nice enough to feel and hear that little click. to remove you will once again push on the card to hear that click and it will release the card from the slot."
1081187,akaShag,2022-07-18 01:24:00,2073,Thanks again for good advice!  I was wondering if I would ever have to remove the card once I get it in there.  Why would one need to remove it? Doug
1081188,DaddyMac,2022-07-18 01:55:00,1,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8O5UoM4o0s I found this video very helpful when setting up my Helix for optimal performance.  I use it for mostly lake trout fishing but I'm sure it could help in any scenario. Good luck. Mac
1081189,porkpie,2022-07-18 04:25:00,2521,The only time I've ever removed a card is if I'm swapping sonar units and the new one didn't come with a card. Your mileage may vary!
1081190,AKRISONER,2022-07-18 11:57:00,5558,I was autocharting a bunch with a helix 7 for a time so that required swapping cards. Then I acquired a helix 9 and it had two slots so I didn’t need to swap anymore. Now I’ve gone totally Garmin so I don’t touch cards what so ever because they own navionics.
1081193,akaShag,2022-07-18 19:18:00,2073,"We had a saying in my old work place, TMFI.  Too Much ""freakin"" information........  I will have to look at that video another ten times to absorb all of it.  Thanks!"
1081194,akaShag,2022-07-18 19:22:00,2073,"OK I put on the cheaters, got the itty bitty disk out of the SD card, and successfully seated it in the unit.  I think! When I wore a younger man's clothes I could tie a #16 hook onto 2 lb test without glasses...................🙄 Thanks again Bill, that was MOST useful! Doug"
