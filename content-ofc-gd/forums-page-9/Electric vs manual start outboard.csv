1081298,siwash,2022-07-27 10:19:00,683,I'm looking at two engines. Both early 80s models and both OMCs and equal hp. The electric start is $250 more (without tank and hose). The manual comes with tank/hose. Is the electric start worth the extra money? Do they tend to break down and require more repair? Less reliable? I'm just thinking manual might be more reliable because there's less to break down. Electric is nice and convenient though. Â Thoughts?  Thanks
