1080010,huey graphite,2022-05-03 22:22:00,362,Booked a cabin for our annual spring trip for the last weekend in May. Looking for tips for walleye as well as where I can find a depth chart/map. TIA.
1080015,BillM,2022-05-04 04:04:00,17367,Have you tried Google?  Lots of information.
1080016,huey graphite,2022-05-04 12:48:00,362,What is this Google thing you speak of?
1080017,Terry,2022-05-04 13:14:00,14456,google click here
1080021,irishfield,2022-05-04 17:13:00,26272,"Search function here works as well.. just type in Tomiko and you'll see over a dozen threads on it. Here's one with my pictures of the lake, so you know what you're on.... "
1080023,huey graphite,2022-05-04 18:23:00,362,"Prior to posting my question I had done an extensive search of OFC and found some good info. but much of it from several years ago including several comments stating to the OP ""I'll PM you"".  This will be my 1st time fishing the lake so hoping to get some new input."
1080030,irishfield,2022-05-04 21:56:00,26272,Well I can promise you that the outlay of the lake hasn't changed!
1080043,aplumma,2022-05-05 12:28:00,6896,The reason you see the P.M. me response is in the rules of the site we do not allow specific spots to be shared. In the past sharing fishing spots created more issues than it solved. I am sure that once you see the lake you will be able to talk to the locals or the owners of the lodge and they can direct you in the right direction. Good luck and happy fishing Art
1080044,huey graphite,2022-05-05 12:48:00,362,"I can understand that policy. I've been a member here for 20 years or more. Not as active as I used to be for various reasons. I'm not looking for fishing spots. Moreso, any particular tackle I should bring with me. Do most jig for them( as we do on  (Nipissing) or troll harnesses? Worms? Minnows? Bodybaits? etc Dusk or dawn better than daytime?"
1080058,aplumma,2022-05-05 16:22:00,6896,When I fish the Nip most of the time I troll a manns plus 25 deep diving lure in the chrome and blue. This seems to work along the rock walls and ledges. I am not much of a walleye fisherman though but most of the folks go out just before the mosquitos attack at dusk and use worm rigs on the edges of the weed lines that have deep water nearby. Art
1080081,Chrispy,2022-05-06 17:27:00,168,"Hey Huey, where are you staying?  I have been to the lake twice, once in the spring and once in the fall.  Great bass fishery for sure, walleyes are hard to come by you really have to work for them. I sent you a PM with maps and spots.  Good luck and tight lines!!"
1080084,huey graphite,2022-05-06 23:41:00,362,Staying at Tomiko Lake Lodge. Thank you for the pm!!
1080124,Chrispy,2022-05-09 18:05:00,168,No problem!!  A member from here helped me when I started going there so I just wanted to pay it forward. Hope you have a great time!
1081116,Dave11,2022-07-11 13:00:00,1,I have a place on Tomiko. I would like some help in finding some good fishing spots. Tough to catch walleye. Thanks
1081118,BillM,2022-07-11 13:36:00,17367,Weed/rock edges.
1081119,Chrispy,2022-07-11 13:43:00,168,The walleye fishing is tough in the summer.  I will PM you with some spots and maps of the lake to try out.
