1081266,glen,2022-07-23 12:16:00,2641,I’m going to GB for salmon and rainbow. What place is the best to launch out of to catch salmon or rainbow?   Meaford.  Owensound wasaga? thanks for any help.   	I’ll report when I get back
1081267,Fisherman,2022-07-23 14:12:00,7201,"Owen Sound east side launch.  However, I would take note of the wind forecast tomorrow.  https://www.ventusky.com/?p=44.47;-79.85;7&l=wind-100m&t=20220724/0900"
1081268,glen,2022-07-23 14:55:00,2641,Ok maybe I’ll wait a day.   	thanks.
1081270,misfish,2022-07-23 22:59:00,29133,Thornbury would be my choice once they get close. 
1081271,misfish,2022-07-24 00:08:00,29133,
1081272,glen,2022-07-24 11:53:00,2641,Going this week sometime.(weather). great pic.
1081273,Rizzo,2022-07-24 12:56:00,4754,is the summer fishing pretty reliable up there? I started in to the salmon/trout thing a few years back (4?) but have only done Lake O. By no means an expert but have had success of some sort almost every time on the water. Lake O as it turns out is a great fishery. Is GB/Huron as reliable? My guess is it would be a tougher spot to try and figure things out.
1081274,BillM,2022-07-24 14:00:00,17367,Gbay is much harder then Lake O.
1081275,glen,2022-07-24 14:41:00,2641,That’s why I’m asking. I’ll take all the help I can get.  I haven’t been for about ten years but I’m going.  Fish are in there somewhere.  If the salmon are too far out/deep then I’ll try rainbows. I have a few things to try. I’m not going to lake O I don’t like the drive/towing.

1081277,glen,2022-07-24 14:58:00,2641,That pic is from about 1998
1081282,Rizzo,2022-07-25 21:42:00,4754,since lake o is a shorter drive for me will just stick with that! Good luck out there let us know how you do
1081284,CrowMan,2022-07-26 00:10:00,413,If you want some for the smoker...GB is definitely worth the drive !
1081289,Rizzo,2022-07-26 12:09:00,4754,not for me. Don't eat fish (or have a smoker)
1081292,DRIFTER_016,2022-07-26 16:54:00,10439,I used to go out of Meaford and Owen Sound when I lived in Ontario.
1081337,muskeybugged,2022-07-28 13:29:00,282,"I'd add Wiarton for a windy day. Colpoy’s bay,  pretty narrow and protected by most wind directions."
1081358,glen,2022-07-28 23:49:00,2641,Already went. Check my other post.
