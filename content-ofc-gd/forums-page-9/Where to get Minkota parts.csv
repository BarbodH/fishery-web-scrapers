1081199,DRIFTER_016,2022-07-19 15:13:00,10439,When I had an issue with my original bow mounted TM I got in touch with Minn Kota and when I was talking to the tech and told him what I was looking for he said he had one and what's my address. Sent it to me no charge!!! Worth a call as they may have some used parts like they sent me.
1081200,skinny,2022-07-19 15:31:00,442,Do you know who/where you called if you can send me msg with info and I will try it
1081203,Fang,2022-07-19 18:52:00,1330,My last issue with Minn Kota was a long time ago (finger crossed) but the electronic and mechanical parts were fixed by Aikmans in Mississauga I think they still are listed on minn kota web site for service outlet

Rockey's Tackle Service 10 Kitchener St..  Building B Orilla, ON  l3v 6z9 705 325-3525 "
1081228,pikeyminnow,2022-07-20 20:40:00,18,I have used Rockey’s in Orillia as well and would highly recommend them. Also there is an ad on Kijiji from a guy from Bridgenorth that has some parts and says he knows the motors quite well and will do repairs. However I can’t vouch for him. The ad ID is 1620380175. Good luck!
