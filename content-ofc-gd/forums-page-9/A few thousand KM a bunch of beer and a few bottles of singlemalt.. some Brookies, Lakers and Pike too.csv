1080900,Freshtrax,2022-06-26 03:17:00,2215,"After a few years off  we trecked north on our pilgrimage for monster Brookies.  Fuel prices be dammed.   Arrived to find Temps and weather about  week ahead of when we usualy arrive  I have never seen Temps in the 50's while fishing here.  Water was also up a foot or two . No monsters this year but lots of good  fish to keep us busy all species were fairly cooperative throughout the week.  The brookies were off a little with the warmer Temps realy had to work for em compared to water Temps in the in the 30's and 40's  .  The Lakers were unlimited in supply and a blast in 6-10 fow on lighter spinning gear, couldn't hookup with the big ones were we have had luck in the past down deeper.  Pike were in super skinny water and super aggressive on top water at times making fishing fun but resulting in more dropped fish than hookups. 24"" Brookie 44"" Pike and  32"" Laketrout being the best for the week.   Great week to disconnect and recharge with 3 of my best friends and my Dad Pretty sure we took a 14 ft boat where no 14 ft boat has ever been on this trip for those who know the lake we had 3 days of glass and made the most of it with some runs up to 30km each way. However the small boat was never out of sight from the big boat when too far from camp. Enough of me talking here's some pics .                           "

1080922,ROOK,2022-06-27 10:52:00,55,WOW- that was some trip you were on !!!!  Was wondering if the brookies that far away still hit EGB spoons and Panther Martins or do they prefer something else ???  Rook

1080936,Freshtrax,2022-06-27 21:44:00,2215,Yep go to tactic in the spring up there bombing the shoreline with spinners  think 2-5 fow.     Spoons work too.     I tried some crazy stuff after having a 24 inch brookie smoke a 6 inch swim bait while pike fishing on the firs day this year and found when they are hungry they do enjoy lager baits.  Now have some new tricks up my sleeve
