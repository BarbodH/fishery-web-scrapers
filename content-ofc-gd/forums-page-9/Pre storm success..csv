1081238,Fisherman,2022-07-21 01:44:00,7201,I've found that the fish can go on a crazy feeding frenzy pre storm.
1081242,mamona,2022-07-21 13:38:00,597,"Nicely done, enjoy your fish ðŸ™‚"
1081246,misfish,2022-07-21 18:01:00,29133,"One morning on Simcoe, they were calling for showers. I made it out early and caught fish like crazy for 2 hours. I had my limit of whities in 10 minutes, played for lakers after. Nailed 7 of them in 45 min. Then the cracking and booming started,rain came down like hell raising waters. Found shelter til it was over. Went out after it had passed. Not a single bite after that storm. Nice pickeral there. "
1081249,BillM,2022-07-21 20:05:00,17367,Pressure changes can really get fish moving.Â  My fav time to fish is right before a big storm.

1081257,Fisherman,2022-07-22 16:30:00,7201,"Pickles, no, they're baby cucumbers.Â  I'm sure a lot would misidentify pickeral. "
