1081416,Terry,2022-08-01 01:40:00,14456,"You have water in the oil ,drain it  and put in fresh gear oil and you should be good for a day or two "
1081427,porkpie,2022-08-01 16:47:00,2521,"Yep you can run that for a couple days, fill her back up and go.  Upper seal somewhere is shot.  I have the same problem with my kicker and had to use my tin boat motor as a Kicker for my 2 week vacation.  I’ve got some work to do when I get back, looks like you do too!"
