1081308,Raycaster,2022-07-27 15:01:00,528,"Got out from Jordan Harbour yesterday hoping to fill my fancy fish bag. Filled bag with ice and was on water by 7am. I have a small 16ft not deep hull so weather is a huge factor on getting out. Water was perfect, bimini up and rods ready. Zig zagged 75ft to 150ft back and forth with a dipsey/flasher/fly on one side and downrigger spoon off the other. Dipsey probably 30-40’ down and downrigger at 60 or so. Downrigger grabbed 3 or 4 decent size lakers and dipsey handled a nice salmon. A couple small guys were handled by the dipsey and a few shook off. Think I went 5-9 on the day and out by noon. This is my 3rd year on Lake Ontario after 30 years chasing Kawartha fish in 4-20ft of water so big learning curve. I’m getting more comfortable and successful and feel like I’m 75% along the way. I think I caught 2 fish my first year putting in many many hours on the water and watching youtube instructions. My second year was an equipment adjustment with proper rods and a used decent downrigger. This year I’m tuning in to location and depth, speed (at the ball) and lure presentation. I still love Kawarthas and Lake St. Clair but Lake Ontario is pretty incredible.     "
