1081165,A cacher,2022-07-16 02:47:00,12,Will be up at duck lake soon and last time i was there fishing was EXTREMLY tough. Just wondering if anyone has any tips to catch fish either there or on the connecting maple lake as I can access it also. It took about 3 days last time i was up there to get the first fish in the boat and i really don't want to go through that again. Thanks for any help.

Last year we vacationed on a small lake near Burk's Falls called Jack's Lake and the fishing was very tough. UGGG the family enjoyed the resort and scenery so we are going back this year. Not looking forward to the fishing. Hope someone can give you some help
