1081523,Snidley,2022-08-06 22:37:00,620,My buddy who is a car/boat dealer and is involved in importing boats from the US and exporting trucks and cars to the US tells me there is a massive fallout coming for dealers in Canada. He says truck deliveries in the US are picking¬† up steam and the market is softening¬†for export pickups here in response.¬† He believes that many dealers (and customers who are paying over MSRP) are going to get caught holding the bag for overpriced inventory. My considered advice would be to hold off buying a truck or car till fall if you are in the market. Same goes for a house I would say too.

Should be even better."

Go in near the end of the month and you might get a deal that is BELOW dealer cost. They make it up with factory incentives that is a murky world of it's own.

He still gets great deals on used boats he buys in the southern US but shipping them to Canada has gone from $700 to $2000. He always has to recondition the boats he sells and not only is that more expensive it's also unbelievably time consuming. Marine mechanics and all of the people that can actually do reconditioning are rare¬† skilled tradesmen and if qualified to do the work properly, they are booked to the max.

1080613,kickingfrog,2022-06-10 01:36:00,8333,Supply and demand. Supply of new boats/engines is not back to 2019 levels so more demand for used boats.
1080617,craigdritchie,2022-06-10 14:03:00,1586,"There are three main issues driving up the cost of new boats. That, in turn, is driving up the cost of used ones. First, supply chain issues remain a huge problem for pretty well every boat builder on the planet. Semiconductors, aluminum, plywood, stainless steel, resin, gelcoat, foam for seat cushions, and a whole bunch of other parts and pieces remain in tight supply. As a result, the cost of components and raw materials has skyrocketed. Shipping costs have also increased massively. The cost to ship a container of parts here from China is now 10x what it cost in 2019. Part of that is higher fuel costs, part of it is higher demand, and a big part of it is extra safety protocols to satisfy covid measures in ports, which are all government controlled. Finally, demand for boats since 2020 has gone through the roof. Dealers have very little inventory, pretty well all boat builders sold out their entire 2022 production runs long ago, and most of them are now well into 2023 meaning if you buy your boat today, it will be some time next summer before you see it.¬†No one wants to wait, so that is driving up the cost of used boats. I don't see prices coming down. The reality is that we're going to see a lot of new, wealthy buyers coming into the market over the next several years as aging baby boomers die off and leave their assets to their kids. In the US, they're expecting millennials to inherit more than US$68 trillion from their baby boomer parents over the next 20 years. Canada's economy is around 1/10th of the US, so reasonable to think that here we're talking about $6.8 trillion changing hands over the same period. Even if only a fraction of these suddenly wealthy millennials become boat buyers, it's still going to be a huge number, and that will hold prices high."

Until supply chain issues clear the prices will remain high.  however what we are seeing right now this spring‚Ä¶I can‚Äôt stress enough this is within the past three months, there is a pause of sorts occurring in the used boat market. Not that boats that are priced ‚Äúfairly‚Äù ( I say that word very lightly ) but boats that aren‚Äôt asking astronomical prices are finally in a price freeze of sorts. guys that ask for that top covid dollar for their boats are not getting it. Which is all fine and dandy because the a ‚Äúgood price‚Äù right now is still astronomically high.
