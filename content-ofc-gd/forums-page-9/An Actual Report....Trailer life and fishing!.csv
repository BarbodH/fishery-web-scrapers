Well, we bought a different trailer in our park and now we are waterfront....it fell into our laps and we just couldn't say no!  I also bought a crimping tool from Amazon and customized my own boat cover since it stays slipped all season and my bilge pump had to work overtime.  This new cover works great! I love the sunrises on this lake, so I added a few pics of that time of day and some of the fish I've caught this year.... Hard to believe we are in August already!! Hope everyone is staying well!      "
