1080923,Raycaster,2022-06-27 13:28:00,528,Just wondering how the lake is doing as Im heading up for a week July 1st. Usually have a ton of luck in South Bay but last few years I been there in August and the fish seemed to move out by then. Im chasing the bass and pike and will hit the usual spots of Ant Island and the narrows to Coboconk. Any “Heads Up” appreciated.

1081122,Raycaster,2022-07-11 14:49:00,528,Well just a quick summary. Pretty slow week. A few average pike and bass but last day pulled a 4lbs. bass off Grand Island. Hitting Canal in a month to chase pike again. Lake Ontario time right now so everything is good…
1081131,Rizzo,2022-07-11 23:13:00,4754,Thanks for the update. We had friends at Balsam last week they also found the fishing very slow.

Friday it was cloudy with a chop and had the best day of fishing I’ve ever had in my life on the tri lakes, Fished a tournament Saturday didn’t have a limit until 1:30 in the afternoon. Cooler water temperatures than is standard for this time of year and the weed growth is behind as well."
1081167,Rizzo,2022-07-16 12:32:00,4754,cool nights keeping water temps down I guess. Means my AC is getting a break though!
