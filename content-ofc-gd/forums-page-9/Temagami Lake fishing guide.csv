I'm looking for any information on fishing guides on Lake Temagami.  We have a trip planned for Crown Land camping and fishing from July 15th to the 24th. It will be a group of 4-5 people with 2 boats, 14 and 16 footer. We're hoping to find a spot in the Northern Arm of the lake and looking to target Lake Trout, Walleye and Whitefish. We spent some time in Cross Lake last year and eventually found productive spots for downrigging Lake Trout but all were smaller in size. Never found any Whitefish and only a few Walleye from one area of the lake. I have had great success in jigging for Whitefish and Lake Trout on other lakes but that's after many trips to those waters and lots of exploration. Temagami is a huge body of water in comparison and with our limited time there we hope to find someone local to the lake that could point us in the right direction.  To cut down on the time spent looking for fish.  Also to share productive techniques. If anyone is aware of guide, professional or amateur or a resident of the area with knowledge of the lake that would be willing to spend a day showing us around either on their boat or ours please let me know. Thanks"
