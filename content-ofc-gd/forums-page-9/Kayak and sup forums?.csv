Looking for that and southern ontario sup forums.  Also looking for a suitable and secure 17"" wide cooler for a yak that wont have the wife grill me over what it costs.  Thank you! "
1081347,Podric,2022-07-28 19:01:00,46,So I did have the URL right: yakfisher.net  that was was a great forum. 	Now it is run by some nameless face running BOQ charters on a 25ftx10ft kayak with 200HP on the back.  Weird. Maybe one day I will find out what happened in 2019.  So that is it for local yak and SUP forums?
