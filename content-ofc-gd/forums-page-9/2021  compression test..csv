1080889,chessy,2022-06-25 13:47:00,610,does anyone here know what compression should be on a 2021 mercury pro kicker 4 stroke  carbarator . I can't find specks on this 
1080892,glen,2022-06-25 15:13:00,2641,I don’t know.  	but it should be similar to any other engine.   	what reading are you getting?
1080893,Fisherman,2022-06-25 17:24:00,7201,"Found this on Walleye Central, I have problems believing it though. Good results for Four-Strokes should be 180-210 PSI, and Two-Strokes should be around 110-130 PSI."
1080895,Terry,2022-06-25 19:21:00,14456,Yeah I think 180 is a great number for a 4stroke. But if both cylinders are the same 125 or more it would still be an ok motor
1080913,chessy,2022-06-26 14:31:00,610,the dealer is getting 115 and 121 on a 2021 with 20 hours on it ruffly ... there is a long story behind this motor...
1080914,Terry,2022-06-26 14:49:00,14456,It’s not a good motor anymore needs work
1080915,chessy,2022-06-26 14:58:00,610,that's what dealer is saying but Mercury says not till below 60.... I think mercury is trying to see if it goes after warrantee ... I will no more on Monday afternoon.... ps this thing has already had 4 carbs on it ...   and from talking to people I am not even certified to hold a screw driver lol.  if carbs sucked air during break-in then that means it ran lean and can burn your pistons ?? 
1080917,Fisherman,2022-06-26 17:44:00,7201,"Being a 4 stroke it should still have enough oil lubing it. Burning the top of the piston, entirely possible.  Unfortunately it's a Merc and we all know they make good anchors."
1080956,chessy,2022-06-29 14:32:00,610,there saying that seeing I have had 4 new carbs that it could be a carbon build up causing low compression ... does this make sense ?? 
1080957,Terry,2022-06-29 14:44:00,14456,"Well if carbon builds up on the rings or ring groves it can cause lower compression So it is possible ,but I am no expert. Just been around long enough to have seen a few things"
1080958,glen,2022-06-29 14:48:00,2641,Someone needs to Pull the head and see what’s in there.   	I hope they fix it for you.  Make them.
1080996,GYPSY400,2022-07-01 13:04:00,191,Sounds like a dealer warranty problem to me.. A mercury 4 stroke should run for at least 10 years before even worrying about the compression.
1081090,ecmilley,2022-07-08 22:11:00,2163,"A bad breakin can cause this from ring sticking, need to.verify valve lash before continuing overtight clearances will.cause issues, especially worn"
