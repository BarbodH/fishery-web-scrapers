1081412,glen,2022-08-01 01:23:00,2641,What a beauty.  I’ll check your report later.
1081421,AKRISONER,2022-08-01 13:17:00,5558,Bunks still the goat! Great stuff as always
1081426,Moosebunk,2022-08-01 16:02:00,3970,"Baaaaahahaha! Thanks baaaahhhdddy!  For making me feel all warm and fuzzy, and tingling in my horn.  Baaahhhem I mean, horns."
1081428,AKRISONER,2022-08-01 21:42:00,5558,"I need to pick your brain about gar fishing some time, I’ve got a couple of spots where I know some giants live and I just have no real clue what it takes to make the big ones bite and stay on."
1081429,siwash,2022-08-01 22:03:00,683,such a strange looking beast... any of you watch YouTube vids of those dudes down in the US SE taking in those monster gar?  they are massive...
1081430,glen,2022-08-01 23:38:00,2641,I’ve land a couple of gar.  That was before we took pictures though.    	nice story thanks.
1081451,Moosebunk,2022-08-03 05:55:00,3970,"AK see your inbox. Alligator gar would be a hoot to reel in and knock of the bucky Siwash.  I'd think bottom baiting for something like that would be much the same as our sturgeon fishing up here... except a whole muddier and sweatier down there in that stanky Texas heat.  That keeps it kinda lower on this pasty white ginger's priority list, the sunstroke and skin cancer and all. lol. Thanks for reading dudes."
1081500,AKRISONER,2022-08-04 17:55:00,5558,Or throw an evergreen jackhammer was fishing santee Cooper a few years back and one followed my jackhammer boatside and was up against the length of my boat. I couldn’t believe my friggin eyes while also being extremely terrified of the 8 foot long monster swimming after my bait. At least the big gators down there don’t chase your baits!
