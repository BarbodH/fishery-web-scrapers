1081243,captpierre,2022-07-21 14:36:00,2521,Getting around to renewing my license. The Transport Canada site says only boats bought after 2010.  	So my 2007 doesn’t require renewal then?
1081245,206,2022-07-21 16:33:00,563,if you are the owner since 2007 or last person to update it before 2010 you should be good. I got my boat in 2011 and have had to update mine once already. they sent me a notice in the mail
