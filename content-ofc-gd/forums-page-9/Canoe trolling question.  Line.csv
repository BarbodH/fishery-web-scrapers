1081381,Ralph Field,2022-07-30 13:37:00,1018,"I would run your power pro to a ball bearing swivel , then attach a 10 lb. flurocarbon leader to the barrel swivel and attach your lure to the leader. I'd use about 4 feet for your leader."
1081382,porkpie,2022-07-30 15:30:00,2521,"Buy torpedo snap swivels, the smallest size they have.  They are remarkably strong.  Run one in front of your lure when trolling if you use spinny lures. Power pro won’t cause line twist.  You won’t regret it!"
1081387,OhioFisherman,2022-07-31 04:09:00,6623,Type of lure?
1081388,gordy28,2022-07-31 10:26:00,638,Thanks all Used both a spoon and a diving crankbait.  Vibration mainly when using the crank bait cheers Andrew
1081389,CrowMan,2022-07-31 11:34:00,413,"A spoon will definitely twist your line...vibration won't. Use a good quality ball bearing swivel...in either combination with your snap or between your leader and main line, and you should be fine."
1081390,dave524,2022-07-31 11:52:00,4508,"Crankbait shouldn't twist , if the spoon is too fast it will spin instead of roll back and forth, slow down."
1081402,OhioFisherman,2022-07-31 18:51:00,6623,"Never trolled out of a canoe, but that, the rod holders or line shouldn't have much effect on line twist, line type, diameter can affect trolling depth. Some crank baits need to be tuned to get them to run well, and some seem more susceptible to damage that affects their running properly. The old storm hot n tots metal bill could break loose from the plastic and get water inside making them spin, and if you have 100 - 150 feet of line out? by the time you notice you have line twist."
