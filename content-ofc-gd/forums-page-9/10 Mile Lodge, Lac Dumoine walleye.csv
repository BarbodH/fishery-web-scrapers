1080326,Iggy,2022-05-19 15:45:00,19,Decided to make 2 trips this year 4 of us in June at the main lodge and our regular outpost trip with 10 guys in August. Looking forward to slaying the Blue Walleye 
1080327,Tomcat,2022-05-19 17:18:00,395,Can you please share what the walleye harvest length limit is at 10 mile lodge?
1080331,Iggy,2022-05-19 17:54:00,19,Anything over 12 inches but we don't keep them that small anyway
1080333,akaShag,2022-05-19 18:44:00,2073,Bring your bug juice!Â  ðŸ˜‰
1080337,Iggy,2022-05-19 22:47:00,19,"Yup, bug juice is required.Â  We are going late June. I flew in back in the day before a road, on the 11th of June, and it was wicked,Â  but late June not sure. Doesn't matter, in the camp and in the boat the blackflies leave you alone.  In August, there are no bug issues except just at sunset with mosquitoes,Â  and they don't bother me much."
1080342,akaShag,2022-05-20 12:36:00,2073,"It was early June I was thinking of, but yes late June you will be swarmed by mosquitoes at sunset I am sure...."
1080343,Iggy,2022-05-20 12:38:00,19,Our first trip up is June 27 Thermocells all fired up
1081103,Iggy,2022-07-09 19:13:00,19,"Well we made it, brought out our limit and had a big fish fry. Fishing was a little tougher than usual. I'm not sure if high water levels affect fishing but they were extremely high. I'd say we caught between 150 and 175 between the 4 of us. Going back in August."
1081105,akaShag,2022-07-09 20:04:00,2073,"150 plus fish for four guys for a week strikes me as pretty darned good!Â  And yes, I am guessing that high water would affect the fishing pretty much anywhere."
1081106,Iggy,2022-07-09 20:43:00,19,"It's not bad but last year, although later in the summer, we did a little better"
