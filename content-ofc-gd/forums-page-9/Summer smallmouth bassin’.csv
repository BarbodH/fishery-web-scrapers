1081527,kickingfrog,2022-08-07 14:18:00,8333,Had a few days at a cottage south of North Bay and was able to land a nice number of topwater smallmouth. My son is a solid angler for 13 while my daughter is a more typical 10 year old so any fish she catches is a big deal for me and her. Besides my daughter’s fish which were caught on a whopper plopper style lure most of mine and my son’s fish were on various walk-the-dog style lures with a few poppers or crazy crawlers in the mix.
