Might have a problem with the livewell and it would be alot easier to remove a few floor panels. They seem to be screwed in but caulked to transom, not sure. If anyone has taken this on, tips would be appreciated. Looks like the most important tool needed will be a bottle of Baileys for my coffeeâ€¦"
