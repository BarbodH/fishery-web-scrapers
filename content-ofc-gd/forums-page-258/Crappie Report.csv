Both new to ice fishing (his first time, my 3rd) we didn't get much for the first hour, a couple takes but nothing to show for it, moved spots and bingo, he's got his first fish through the ice, and the picture basically shows it all..  http://i1135.photobucket.com/albums/m639/Ratz2/fisjhin/503C3F9C-52F3-4104-8666-8D187A1B07BF.jpg"

832515,LesCulpJr,2014-01-25 03:00:00,75,The link works! nice fish:)
832518,Acountdeleted,2014-01-25 03:15:00,2562,Very nice slab.
832522,bigugli,2014-01-25 03:32:00,6138,That's a fine looking specimen.
832524,BillM,2014-01-25 03:44:00,17367,"I'd probably remove the name of the lake from your post, unless you want 100 of your best friends besides you the next time you go out"
832526,irishfield,2014-01-25 03:48:00,26272,Sorry Bill.. but Binbrook Conservation is no secret...
832527,Broker,2014-01-25 03:59:00,482,"However haven't seen as many people out this year as last year, could be the colder temps though haha."
832533,pics,2014-01-25 05:29:00,1268,I fished it on Wednesday.. caught and released a 4-5 lb pike and lost another. Saw a crappie on the camera as well as a bass and some perch.. there seems to be a good year class of pike all around the 5 lb range. Two years ago we caught a lot in the 2 lb range...
832547,moxie,2014-01-25 13:17:00,1566,Nice slab indeed.
832645,pics,2014-01-25 22:39:00,1268,There aren't as many crappies as before due to increased predation from the pike but the ones that are there seem to be getting bigger... Should be interesting at the derby on feb 9th
