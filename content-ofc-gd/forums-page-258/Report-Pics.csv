833175,TDunn,2014-01-28 17:16:00,680,"Well, it has been sometime since I have posted a report on the board. Thought I'd drop in and do a little update!   Spring Last year’s winter would just not leave……It seemed like 3 or 4 times it was finally over but it just kept coming back. The steelhead season this spring on the shores north of the Soo benefited from the weather. Although on a whole, angling pressure on Superior tribs has increased in the last few seasons. This past spring, I saw a decline. April was just plain nasty…..River conditions were great (lots of water)but the weather conditions were hard to fish through; cold and snowy. I had a descent start to the year with one amazing day with my uncle. This was one of the first trips of the season and the numbers weren’t huge for us that day. It was the size of the fish that will stick in my mind for some time. Both of us put our best Superior fish of the spring on the bank on this outing.  This pic was on my phone thankfully….it was my best Superior fish of the spring.   The rest of my spring Superior action was lost when my computer crashed…I was pretty bummed out to say the least since I have an external hard drive and didn’t copy them over but it was the only pictures I lost. As April went on and spring finally sprung, anglers hit the rivers hard during the last week of April into the first week of May but all vanished when walleye opened May long weekend. I stayed home and fished steelhead and hit the best numbers of the year. Chuckin minnow baits was by far the best approach but fish were also taken on spinners, spoons, roe and beads. A few Superior walleye even graced my presence on two different tribs including one nice fish that measured in at 26”. But these are all fish stories with no pictures…..lol   Next up was kayak fishin! Jeff Wall from NoMad Fishing Adventures who runs the Ontario Kayak Fishing Series (OKFS) brought an event to Northern Ontario. Not only was in the first tourney in North for the series but it was a trout/pike tourney which was unique. I had fished the lake last winter and didn’t do too bad with about a dozen lakers caught in our group over two days. The fishing at the tourney wasn’t as hot, or even close. I did horrible not landing a single lake trout and wasting a ton of time on them. I think only 3 lakers were landed over the entire 2 day tourney. I believe the biggest laker was 28” and the best pike was 37” which wasn’t too shabby. The weather was horrible to say the least, I think it rained, pretty much the entire tourney but the yakers toughed it out. This year it's looking like Bay of Quinte for an OKFS event for me.    Next up was the St. Marys River; my home. I did venture into the rapids this spring maybe half a dozen times or so but I spent most of my time out in the boat. We had a blast out there fishing both Canadian and American waters. Insane numbers and we weren’t complaining about the size of the fish coming up from Huron.             I ended the spring with a week-long guide trip with my cousin and fishing buddy Ted. We headed back up to the big town of Oba for some walleye and pike action at Ontario North Fishing Adventures. Last year I was up there in Auguest for a two week gig and were primarily spinner rigging in the warm water. I was excited to be able to still get in on the jig bite before the water warmed up again. The first day up, Ted and I took a rip up the Oba river to check some of the fishing grounds on the lake and do some scouting. We found out quick the fishing was on…             Over the next few days we were spoiled with countless walleye and pike throughout the days with our guests…. Not to mention some good eats!!!       Had these two hanging around the entire time. They would come by for a bite to eat and snooze each  evening.           Before leaving we had the chance to try a small lake about half hour from the lodge. The fishing was slow compared to previous years but we still managed a few.       Summer We catch Atlantic salmon YEAR ROUND on the river but the big, silver, lake run fish start to roll in early summer hang around in the main river for a few weeks gorging on bait fish then head into the rapids searching for cooler water.  We had a few days with some great numbers but we really didn’t get out for Atlantics much this year. Once the boat pressure picks up, we tend to move onto other things…..         Next up was Superior Summer Kings.  We launched and within fifteen minutes of trolling we were hooked up. First few fish of the day took green spoons deep on the riggers but as the day went on the cheaters with black and silver spoons began to fire.        (no pics of this trip, cameraman hasn't sent me over any pics yet!!) A few weeks later, I took a trip up to Lake Nipigon to fish for brookies. We fished hard 12+ hours a day and really didn’t get on a pattern this year unlike last. Fishing on this trip was ok, compared to last year’s pounding. I would say we caught more fish one a few single days last year than we did on our whole trip this year!! What can ya do! Unfortunately fish turn off even on the best lakes in the world! With all this said we still caught some beautiful fish and explored some new areas that will benefit us on trips to come. I caught my best speck only a few minutes in at the first spot we tried! A coloured up 23 1/2"" male took my jigfly boatside! Mid trip my buddy noticed a flat tired (roofing nail) so we had to make an appointment at Canadian Tire in Nipigon. Since we had to go to town we brought the boats and launched at Alexander Dam and tried our luck out. Last year we fished the dam for 3-4 hours on our way out and we caught specks, lakers, rainbow, walleye and whitefish. It was quite remarkable. This year we had some brookies follow to the boat but no takers. What we did catch was Chinooksand Pink salmon. Not what we were after but fun none the least, especially for my partner on the trip who had never caught a king. Next year looks like we are going to head further north on Nipigon and try Onamans on labour day weekend. Man, I can't wait!!  Fall  Work then became extremely busy and I wasn’t on the water very much until the coho and steelhead started running up the rivers in September. I spent the majority of my time on the tribs north fishing solo and also mixed in some guiding with some good guys from Ohio and Michigan. Coho numbers were tremendous in late sept/early October and the rivers were loaded with cookie cutter steelies munching out. My last trip north was mid-November this year as our winter set in very early.               Hit some kings on the river downtown but didn't put much time into them this year.    The rapids was blown until early Nov. A few of the gates were fully open turning the rapids into pretty well, unfishable water for most of the fall. The salmon were virtually untouched this season while they did their business! I like that! Once the gates were closed, I did wade out on a few occassions with a buddy.   Only one trip out in the boat for Nov, which turned out to be the last trip of the open water year. Conditions on this day were insane with a blizzard to start the day out and we finished the day wet from rain. We still managed a few fish but nothing much for big steel. Ted did end the year with a beauty late fall Atlantic.       I stayed off first ice this year because of a busy schedule again but I did manage to get out to my favourite weed bed two/three weeks after lock up. The panfish bite was ok but the 38” pike on the 24” ml jig rod made for an entertaining battle. Oddly enough, I didn’t have a flag all afternoon.     Decided to head back out two days later.Just for the afternoon again, expecting some more pannies. Well, the pannies did come out to play but a few nice gators hit my dead bait too!       Lately, Ive also been landing some beauty open water Lake Trout!!         I hope everyone enjoyed this quick update and hopefully I can get some ice reports up over the next few months with some more detail. I havent been on the ice much but with the long winter we still have ahead, I'm thinking I still have a ton of time! It seems like it snows everyday!!! That said.....I better go shovel the driveway   TDunn"
