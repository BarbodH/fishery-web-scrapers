832288,skdds,2014-01-24 01:25:00,195,Located in the adjacent shops beside the v mills parking lot on the north side
832294,BillM,2014-01-24 01:52:00,17367,Why not get them in Lefroy or in Barrie?

If he hears it enough times, he might finally figure out the adventure of finding his business is likely costing him money. Good, healthy live bait though."

Because you're upset about some parking fees?  In a place that's not even near the laker/whitie/perch grounds?  Seriously man, don't come if the parking fees upset you that much.  I'm sure the city of Barrie won't give a lick.  I can't believe the people whining about that, it's pretty funny."
832328,Pikeslayer,2014-01-24 03:40:00,1443,For the OP; Where's the bait shop in Lefroy? Are they open early?
832331,Pikeslayer,2014-01-24 04:03:00,1443,Apologies to Redpearl for the hijack.
832372,BillM,2014-01-24 15:22:00,17367,"redpearl, are you fishing lakers/whities or perch?   Depending on which one, it will dictate which shop you go to"
