833208,LesCulpJr,2014-01-28 20:14:00,75,"max capacity= 4people or 1100lbs.....usually the 4 people are my wife and 2 younger sons (11,5) definetly not overloaded.. Do any of the so far naysayers have experience with smart tabs?  A little bit of common sense tells me that if and when I may be overloaded that I am not too worried if I am up on plane or not. That would be just plain stupid. The boat is a StarCraft sf dlx for those who are interested. Cheers again M.M.  Yes I have a little experience. LOL. Ok so you maybe your not over weight or so you think based on what you can see, however your common sense should tell you if the boat performs fine with 2 guys and too much gear yet performs like crap with two more people, that you are carrying significant weight in the vessel.  Lets do some math using average weight of persons on board. You can put in actual weights if you like. Your Cap. plate states 4 persons or 1100lbs. Motor - 120lbs, Gas (full tank) 50lbs, Kids (2xage)+10 = weight/kgs x 2.2 =114lbs, Mom 150lb, Dad 200lbs, Battery 100lbs (1only), Bowmount motor 30lbs. Totalled up so far we are at 764lbs. We have not accounted for gear, food or drinks for the day. 1100-765 = 335lbs to go  Now the floor in your vessel will have 1/2 inch plywood that will no doubt absorb some water and will have a bank of injected foam flotation running from bow to stern on the port and starboard side. This injected foam absorbs an ENORMOUS amount of water even with a dry hull and never dries out. I'm not sure anyone has actually ever figured out how much this stuff weighs water logged but any one that has ever removed it from a boat can tell you its very heavy. That said you also need to account for any water in the bilge and live well at 10 lbs/gal.  Long story short you are, at the very least, at capacity for your vessel. But based on my experience you are prob a couple hundred lbs or more over capacity with 4 people on board. It is a big mistake to judge the load of your vessel based on where the water line rests on the outside of the hull or by simply eyeballing the items it contains. Many have found that out the hard way.  Now consider your 25hp motor (brand new) puts out 1875 lbs of thrust (estimated. 1hp=75lbs thrust) and your trying to push around at least 1100lbs with that. Now factor in wind and wave action and friction of water on the hull... Doesn't sound very good from a get up and go perspective does it:) A properly set up vessel (which yours sounds to me is) of your type, operating within its LIMITS should not need any aids.  Will you notice a difference with tabs? No doubt.  Are they worth the trouble and investment? IMO and experience. No  They simply keep the bow of the boat down while providing transom lift during take off to aid planing and aid with keeping heavy boats on plane at lower speeds. However if your motor is already pushing all it can push, the results would be minimal. Their purpose is more to help out vessels that are moderately under powered. Not to help vessels that are maxed out on power and possibly over weight They also may create an unsafe condition while travelling light by possibly providing too much transom lift which could cause the stern to slide or skip while cornering.  Sorry everyone for the long post. Do with the information what you wish and have a great season:)"

833213,LeXXington,2014-01-28 21:01:00,1928,I had a 25hp on my boat 3 people great could just get on the plane 4 people not a chance. I had to upgrade to a 40. Still I would recommend the smart tab.  Adds stability. Slows down a drift more control in waves  I even got one for my 40hp just because I liked the control so much.  enjoy

832874,mike rousseau,2014-01-27 04:38:00,4661,I'd be very surprised to hear that tabs allowed you to plane out a 14 footer with 4 people in it... That's a lot if weight for a small boat and 25hp.... I'd imagine that's over your weight limit on that boat as well.....   ...
832882,LesCulpJr,2014-01-27 05:36:00,75,I agree with the above. your getting the best out of your boat and you're over the weight rating. Tabs will not work.

832887,Terry,2014-01-27 09:55:00,14456,they should help
832892,scugpg,2014-01-27 12:21:00,1373,I would check to see where your cavitation plate is to in relation to the bottom of your hull. should be level or no more than 1 inch below the hull else it will cause drag. also consider an se sport 200 hydrofoil if your motor is compatible. I had similar issues on a small boat and raising the motor to right height off the transom and adding the hydrofoil fixed the issue. only lost about 1-2 mph off the top end by adding the foil but planes at lower speed now. smart tabs could be another option but not sure how they would fit or look on such a small narrow boat. sounds like they work well though.
832895,Muskieman,2014-01-27 12:31:00,2472,"I had a set , they worked great to help get to plane , they worked even better to stop porpoising when I was alone ."
832902,scugpg,2014-01-27 14:11:00,1373,also is your transom exactly 20in high? check your motors manual I think you had a sea pro 25? the european version is 22.1in long for transom height. the us version may be that length too so it could be dragging a bit below the boat. if the motor is bolted on maybe you can raise it up a hole or two. if its clamped you would need to safely/securely find a way to raise the transom height. its a bit of a trial and error to find opitimum height. too high and the prop can cavitate especially on turns.
832911,mcdougy,2014-01-27 15:12:00,274,"Thanks for the info. The motor is actually a ss and clamped on for reasons needed. Im sure your experience is accurate spooled since it is something you have experimented with. I think I will take a good look and see if there is room for the smart tabs, your opinion of minimal room is accurate."
832915,wallyboss,2014-01-27 15:19:00,1095,Before adding anything you have to make sure that the motor is at the right height on the transom. It made all the difference in the world on my setup.  Do you have to fight with the tiller to keep your boat straight? That was another problem I had with mine that got fixed by raising the motor to the right height.
832916,scugpg,2014-01-27 15:28:00,1373,so the boat is a short shaft transom height then? the ss sea pro looks to be around 17.1in so still dealing with possible drag below the boat.
832932,Sinker,2014-01-27 16:56:00,8692,"If the motor is too low, a 1"" high piece of hardwood on the transom will make a world of difference. I have to do that with mine, and it improves handling and performance a lot. I have a longshaft transom with a 40 tiller on a 16 ft widebody starcraft.  S."
832934,Bernie,2014-01-27 16:59:00,3190,I am surprised no one has mentioned that the engine may be overpropped for a load in the boat.
832936,Garnet,2014-01-27 17:15:00,2056,Weight distribution is always issue.
832979,aplumma,2014-01-27 20:04:00,6896,Smart tabs are calibrated for a normal load they are not like a manual or pump hydraulic systems that you can adjust the angle of attack for a load condition. I run hydraulic tabs with a computer system to adjust for various loads of people moving from side to side or front to back on a 28ft boat. It works well but is not economical for smaller boats. If you are with in the limits of the tabs they will help plane quicker but if you are over weight the deflection angle will not be enough to cure your issue.    Art
833036,mcdougy,2014-01-27 23:40:00,274,"Wooo-hee    .........Ive had lady friends tell me to add an inch before   and I couldn't,     but never heard I've got an inch too much I understand what you fellas are trying to tell me. Is this a case where too much shaft   is really exaggerated while under heavy load, and the unability to achieve plane while approaching maximum capacity? Cause as earlier stated, under light loads the boat pops up on plane in a jiffy and have never had issues with handling IMO?  Again, I appreciate all the helpful information that I receive from this forum. Cheers M.M.  p.s.  next post will have a much cleaner tone....sorry to some."

Prop hub drilling(Free if you do it right) and a doel-fin($50?). A lot less money and just as effective in your case."
833072,scugpg,2014-01-28 00:59:00,1373,In your case just having the motor at correct height may fix it. Otherwise a hydrofoil or smart tabs should get you the stern lift to plane it out under heavy load. You will likely gain some top end by having the motor at right height as well.  edit: You could also play with different props but you would need a tach and would only make sense after the motor is setup correctly on the transom.
833105,mcdougy,2014-01-28 03:06:00,274,"I found a fairly detailed and interesting read on this conversation.  Im sorry I couldn't copy and paste it here. I googled ""correct height to mount engine on transom"" and a pdf was there.  It had a bit of conflicting answers to what I am trying to solve."
833119,BillM,2014-01-28 04:52:00,17367,I don't think smart tabs are going to help plane a 14ft tiller when it's loaded up with 4 guys + gear.   You're simply running out of omph.
833166,DRIFTER_016,2014-01-28 16:12:00,10439,"May not help it get on step Bill, but it will help lift the stern and most likely be able to get more speed out of it."
