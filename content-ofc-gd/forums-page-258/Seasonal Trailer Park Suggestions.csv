However were having a hard time finding a good park, some of the websites don't have info etc. We have found that a lot of the nicer quiter parks don't even have a website. Anyway back to the point were looking for suggestion for a campground, preferably have waterfront sites, water/sewage/electricity, and personally one that has GREAT fishing haha. If you have any suggestions you can on me or post on here. Any tips are greatly appreciated thanks!"

I'll agree on this one.  One of the guys from work stayed there until last year when he moved further north, he liked the place."

832837,KawarthaGuy,2014-01-27 01:12:00,46,"Hey Shasta,  In 2012 I did a lap around Rice Lake in Southern On and stopped in on every resport/ trailer park.  Checked out pricing, amenities, owners, park layout, septic, proximity to good fishing, etc.  At the high end was $5,000+/season incl waterfront site ($3,500 for non), conference facilities, restaurant, store, pool, etc.  Large park (need a golf cart), lots to do, well run, nice owner, profitable.  Trailer parking was in a field way out-of-view.  Mid-range was $3,000+ for non-waterfront site, some amenities like pool, store, fish cleaning hut, freezer facilities.  Each site was big enough to park your boat trailer - bonus!  Nice owner - family run.  Low-range was $2,500 for non-waterfront, no amenities, very small property - afterthought for trailers.  Few trees, family run.  Kawartha Guy  "

833073,sofabed,2014-01-28 01:09:00,119,You could try Springrock on Lower Buckhorn. One lock gets you to the tri lakes and 2 puts you in Stoney Lake. Lower buckhorn is a great lake as well

Fishing was good for smallies, some big largies and apparently a decent lake trout lake.  www.homesteadpark.com"
