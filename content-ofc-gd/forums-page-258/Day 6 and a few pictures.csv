We spent the day visiting friends in Clearwater Beach and found a nice motel right on the beach so we are going to move there tomorrow. I'll try to get some pictures of the sun and sand to send back up North, perhaps that will help!  "
832320,Moosebunk,2014-01-24 03:24:00,3970,"Fun and sun.  Man, that'd be nice.  Enjoy it Cliff... cause even if ya come home in June it'll likely be -30C."
832322,bigugli,2014-01-24 03:28:00,6138,Enjoy every minute and take your time.  Ice out won't be til the May two four weekend.
832327,Entropy,2014-01-24 03:38:00,747,who's that with the bare bum in your photo bucket?
832343,Big Cliff,2014-01-24 10:11:00,6899,"who's that with the bare bum in your photo bucket? Didn't realize you could see all the photo's in my library. That was from last fall when I wanted to show some guys what a real ""White Tail"" looked like LOL"
832345,ketchenany,2014-01-24 11:38:00,3229,man that pier sure looks good compared to what we are having! That sure is a nice white tail.
832371,TennesseeGuy,2014-01-24 15:20:00,957,"Hope the sun heats up so it can warm your bones.  Best to stay away from all those old folks down there with all their bad knees, bad backs and worn out hips.   Might be contagious.    Don't want you to catch anything from them."
832373,Musky or Specks,2014-01-24 15:34:00,2710,Finally some fish porn. Add a drink on the rocks to that photo and that's my idea of ice fishing.
832387,Beans,2014-01-24 16:54:00,3339,Oh how I envy you...Enjoy my friend...Enjoy !
832411,fishnsled,2014-01-24 19:05:00,3520,"Looks like you are having a great time!  Don't worry about missing out on any ice fishing, we should be good till at least June if these temps keep up.   Bunk is being very pessimistic with the temps at -30 in June, I'd say we'll be topped out at -20 by then.   lol!"
832467,Ron,2014-01-24 23:36:00,1683,"No need to send the pics of teh white sand on the beach Cliff. We got lots of it here only it melts away instead of going up the crack of yer ......  Glad to see the pair of you are enjoying your holiday!  Cheers, Ron..."
832469,Ron,2014-01-24 23:38:00,1683,HEY!  Who is showing their tan line?  http://s896.photobucket.com/user/cbignell/media/WhiteTail_zpsbde41ea9.jpg.html
832562,Squid,2014-01-25 15:56:00,1656,LOL Ron!
