831505,Fisherpete,2014-01-19 21:30:00,1814,"A few fishies from the first few trips on the ice this year…  Quinte – Andrew and I caught 5 each – my first 5 eyes thru the ice.            My new digs for this winter. 3 man Eskimo pop up. Love all the room inside.    Mmmmmmm propane flavoured weeeeeeeiners… nice to have something hot to eat while out there!    Simcoe Sketchy first ice… was 5” in one spot, then this 50ft away!    Nice one by Andrew    Beauty by Scott – top secret lure (not really) sworn to secrecy LOL    Took my brother out for lakers for the first time – and he catches this on the first drop after I tutor him on how to catch one using the sonar… 33.5” that he fought to the hole, then had it run all the way back to the bottom in 110’! I got skunked that day while rassling with my sonar. Also got to meet two legends of the lake for the first time out on the ice – Brian and Terry – great to meet you!       Next trip – my sonar issues now solved – I hooked 4 lakers, landed one 5-6 pounder, lost another at the hole and two halfway up. Probably had around 20 chasers throughout the day. Only marked what I am pretty sure was whities a few times throughout the day and could not get one to bite. It was my brother’s turn to get skunked, although he had 15+ chasers as well. Walking through the slushfest was a good workout on this day. Beauty day out there, very mild – I never went in the hut once thru the day.  Lovin’ the ice this year! Can't wait for one of those banner days when the chasers are all hungry!"

832138,Pikeslayer,2014-01-23 01:40:00,1443,Nice fishies. Putting newbies on firsts or PB's is very rewarding
832319,Moosebunk,2014-01-24 03:22:00,3970,"Wicked Pete.  You're slayin' em as usual.  Eyes and lakers like that, best of both worlds."
832506,Fisherpete,2014-01-25 01:33:00,1814,"JBailey - sorry for the late reply, missed your question. There was at least 9 or 10"" of ice on my last trip to Simcoe - 6 or 7 black and 3 white. I'm sure even more after the cold weather in the past two weeks. If you are talking about that thin ice pic - my buddy said it was less than 2"" in that spot with 5"" less than 50 feet away! Scary stuff. Quinte had around 5 or 6 inches but that was almost a month ago."
832520,LesCulpJr,2014-01-25 03:22:00,75,Nice fish! haven't made it to quinte yet...
