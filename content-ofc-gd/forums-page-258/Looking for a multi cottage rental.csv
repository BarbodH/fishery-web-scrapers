The fishing is fantastic..3 lift locks from rice lake but you wont need to go that far up for awesome fishing...I have a seasonal trailer there for the last 5 years now. Love it there. Lots for the kids to do and lots for the big kids to do too. Darts, horse shoes and most importantly the Fishing! The scenery  is amazing and the hiking is even better.. Call and ask for rates for multiple bookings. Tell him Ron Ritchie (thats me) told you to call and you want a good dealhttp://www.colespoint.ca/en/"
