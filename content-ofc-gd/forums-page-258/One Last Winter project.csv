The blanks is an ISJ782-M Rainshadow for 1/8 - 3/8 baits. We used Micro-Wave guides, a size #17 Fuji VSS reel-seat, a factory grip and one of my hand made butts.   The heart of the Microwave guide system is this double guide that removes all the loops from the line coming off the spinning reel to reduce line-slap and give you longer, more accurate casts...You can trust me...It works.   Details of the Fore-end wrap...      And the Butt wrap...     It threw a 1/4 ounce sinker over 100ft. on a test cast...I think the client will be pleased...Grin. Garry"
