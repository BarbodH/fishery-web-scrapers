833221,BillM,2014-01-28 21:56:00,17367,"First you need the Navionics card reader (They've encrypted all their SD cards) then a program like NavPlanner should do the trick.  Sucks you've gotta pay even more to read the map you've already bought, lol.  I've heard some guys have had luck using the Lowrance emulator, but that's nothing I've ever looked into."
833228,lookinforwalleye,2014-01-28 22:10:00,4399,Don`t think the reader is required for the newer cards or so I was told.
833232,BillM,2014-01-28 22:14:00,17367,Don`t think the reader is required for the newer cards or so I was told.  That would be nice.  Being required to buy a reader to read a card you've already purchased is a joke.
833233,Roy,2014-01-28 22:15:00,13728,Thanks Bill. I've had and still have a few Navionics chips and I should be replacing some soon but I've never needed to read them other than off the GPS units. (Lowrance) Today I was planning on doing some map scouting for the spring and summer and got hung up on the chip reading. I'll see what I can find. Thanks again.
