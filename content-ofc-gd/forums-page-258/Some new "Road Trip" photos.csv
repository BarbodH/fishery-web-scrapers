833364,bigugli,2014-01-29 13:51:00,6138,You are in the right place. Judy wants you to adopt her next winter
833374,BillM,2014-01-29 14:33:00,17367,"Nice Cliff!  I don't think that second fish is a whiting though, they don't have teeth...   Whitings  (to me at least) look like a combination of a drum/red fish/cod, lol!.   That thing almost looks like a weird variation of a sea trout (With the two fangs sticking down)..     We caught a bunch of bonnethead sharks as well up to just under 40inches!  Wicked fighters!     Have you fished Honeymoon Island State Park yet?"
833386,Beans,2014-01-29 16:43:00,3339,Hey Cliff...  You forgot to post this picture:    You can hide but it will find you...  
833389,crappieperchhunter,2014-01-29 16:51:00,2582,Nice shots Cliff. Where did the white tail one go? It was my favourite
833399,Freshtrax,2014-01-29 17:43:00,2215,"Looks like a blast,  I lived 2 hours from myrtle as a youth and have had some great times there over the years."
833412,Big Cliff,2014-01-29 19:24:00,6899,"Great pics Cliff.  Looks like a nice place to be, especially right now  Thanks Joey, I can only imagine how spectacular they would be if you were here to take them. I've been called a lot of things over the years but photographer isn't one of them. You are in the right place. Judy wants you to adopt her next winter Don't know if Sue would go along with that LOL  Nice Cliff!  I don't think that second fish is a whiting though, they don't have teeth...   Whitings  (to me at least) look like a combination of a drum/red fish/cod, lol!.   That thing almost looks like a weird variation of a sea trout (With the two fangs sticking down)..     We caught a bunch of bonnethead sharks as well up to just under 40inches!  Wicked fighters!     Have you fished Honeymoon Island State Park yet? It is really hard to figure out what is what down here, so many of the fish are very similar in color. If I ask five people on the pier, I get five different opinions. Whatever they are those teath sure look like they could do some serious damage.  Hey Cliff...  You forgot to post this picture:  Florida Snow....jpg  You can hide but it will find you...   That's why I just kept heading South my friend, so far so good at least here in Clearwater, high here today is only +12 but by Friday we are supposed to be back up into the low 20s. Lets see it snow then!  Nice shots Cliff. Where did the white tail one go? It was my favourite  Sue saw it, does that explain everything? Looks like a blast, I lived 2 hours from myrtle as a youth and have had some great times there over the years. I really like Myrtle Beach but it was getting too cold so we ended up coming over to Clearwater Beach. I am glad we did now."
