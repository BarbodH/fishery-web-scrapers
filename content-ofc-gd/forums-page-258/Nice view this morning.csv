832857,Christopheraaron,2014-01-27 02:50:00,3525,"Great pic Joey!  Sounds like today was just a bad one for fishing all around, we went to an amazing crappie lake (in the spring at least) and only managed a pumpkinseed, then we went to a perch pond where I have never gotten skunked at and didn't mark more than one fish!"
832858,NAW,2014-01-27 02:55:00,4022,Marked 40+ fish.  Not a kiss.  No schools.  All single fish.  Anyone got them figured out?  Piss-poor conditions just made it worse.
832859,Joey,2014-01-27 02:58:00,9122,"Ya, it was a hard sell today.  You'd think you'd at least get a perch Chris   We had tons of chasers Nick, and I saw a large school, but no commitment."
832860,BillM,2014-01-27 02:59:00,17367,Been a hard sell all season it seems.
832876,Nipfisher,2014-01-27 04:41:00,2449,"You all have to come visit us on Nipissing. I iced 4 walleye today and 2 perch without even trying. I was pissing around in the hut and lost at least another 5 fish. Just a set line and minnow.  I only fished from 3-5:30. One nice one at 21"" went back in along with a little guy. Kept 2 jumbos and 1 eye."
832889,ketchenany,2014-01-27 11:10:00,3229, I was pissing around in the hut  Marking the territory were we! Lol
832894,Locnar,2014-01-27 12:31:00,645,"I got skunked for Whities yesterday... and according to the COs, so did everyone in the area."
832897,Fish Farmer,2014-01-27 13:12:00,2234,"Nice picture Joey, looks like a lot of snow on the lake. Could make for hard travel for the ATV. Still haven't been to suicide hill Bear Pt. yet for Whities."
832906,DanD,2014-01-27 14:47:00,2223,"Yea same for us, St Williams (Long Point Bay); 5 people, 7 hours & 2 perch. But man did we had a good time, I don't think I've laughed as much in a long time; the perch would just have been a bonus. LOL  Dan."
832921,Joey,2014-01-27 16:01:00,9122,"Nice picture Joey, looks like a lot of snow on the lake. Could make for hard travel for the ATV. Still haven't been to suicide hill Bear Pt. yet for Whities.  Thanks, just a cell phone pic, the camera was still packed up at that point.  As for the snow, the wind came up so strong yesterday that the lake did not look like that when we left.  It had snow patches and sheer ice patches, about a 50/50 split of both."
