832946,mike rousseau,2014-01-27 18:06:00,4661,Cool video...  Most deep diving cranks with long lips are good for avoiding snags as well...  I started off trolling 30 foot taildancers slamming bottom in 15 feet of water..... Successfully....
832947,mike rousseau,2014-01-27 18:08:00,4661,"One piece of advice tho.... If you plan on trolling like this making bottom contact regularity.... Then troll ""rod in hand""..... Even the smallest weed or piece of moss can throw your lure out of tune and out of the strike zone..."
