I am trying to find something fun (we wont be fishing this trip unless from a dock) and I am single dad, so somewhere with a variety of fun activities to keep them busy (and control my sanity)....thanks in advance!!!!"
833239,fishing n autograph,2014-01-28 22:23:00,2540,MacGregor Point in Port Elgin is nice. I took my daughters there the weekend after may 24 for their first camping experience and it was awesome
833275,mcdougy,2014-01-29 00:49:00,274,"My favourite Provincial Park is Awenda within your travel distance, with very small kids.  Beauty hardwood forest, very large spread out sites, town not too far, sites away from water for wondering kids, decent playgrounds. Just a very nice park IMO and Ive been to a bunch with the family."

Kid's activities, playground , good bass,pike panfish small lake so a canoe or small boat works fine."
833315,Tim Mills,2014-01-29 03:32:00,476,A couple of options close to the GTA:  We did a father/son group camping trip at Earl Rowe PP is near Alliston about 10yrs ago.  Close by and a nice beach.  There is a trailer park on Lake Bellwoodn near Fergus that has camping spots and probably trailers to rent as well.  Community Pool too.
833325,adempsey,2014-01-29 05:38:00,1498,"Lovesick Lake Park  Large campground/RV park with a gift shop, restaurant, beach and close to Burleigh Falls.  Should be a lot of kids around.  "
833340,lew,2014-01-29 11:41:00,12766,Lovesick Lake Park   Lovesick Lake Park really is a nice place and we used to camp there when I was  kid way back in the late 50's.  I now live just 10 minutes down the road from there and although we don't camp there we often go to their restaurant for breakfast or dinner.  Beautiful camp in a beautiful location with great fishing.  I'd 2nd the recommendation.
833348,jedimaster,2014-01-29 12:39:00,3472,"My kids really enjoy balsam. Has a nice beach to play, lots of rentals, and plenty of camp sites. Not so private but kids don't care about that."
833356,Muskieman,2014-01-29 13:25:00,2472,"We went to "" Camp Hillbilly "" a few years ago to meet up with some friends from Oakville , despite being right beside the highway , I was impressed with the facility and lack of traffic noise .. lots for kids to do ."
833427,pylon,2014-01-29 20:22:00,68,Rock wood conservation area just east of Guelph is a very we'll run spot with loads of pumpkin fish and some bass. Canoe rentals and a nice beach / trails playground
