Nothing big but it was awesome getting out there close to a month earlier then previous years.......on the ATV too! I know you guys like to hear the reel peeling line but I use the waterproof case for the GoPro so you'll have to listen to a little bit of RUSH instead!  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZELaSJaLgrQ  Cheers, Colin"
