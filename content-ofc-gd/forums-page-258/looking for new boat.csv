817196,anders,2013-11-07 05:12:00,1168,"where you talking about my alumacraft pyro, if so i will email you, if not disregard.  http://ontariofishingcommunity.com/forums/index.php?showtopic=71633   thanks"
817197,Old Ironmaker,2013-11-07 08:01:00,8243,"Yes I couldn't agree more. I'm assuming that Pyro is shopping smart and taking into consideration what a good solid well kept boat looks like. I've seen 5 year old boats that look like they have never seen a fender. I looked at many, many when I got back into boating a five years ago . If the thing is a mess and the guy is trying to sell it with old Tim cups and crushed beers cans on the floor, mildew on everything, rips in the seats and the list goes on I bet the engine hasn't seen much maintenance either. Here's where I generally judge a book by the cover.  Pyro  If your buying used you must put it in the water. It's going to be tough doing this in the winter. you can always do a leak test by filling the bilge with a garden hose and look under the hull. No big deal to run the motor with the garden hose. Pull the plugs, check all the accessories, all of them. Yes it will have to be rewinterized, if the guys not willing to do it don't consider the boat in my opinion. And a well maintained trailer as well. it's $125,00 a tire. You want greaseable bearings, with grease in them. No rust, good carpets on the bunks, side guides. A transom saver. I haven't done a poll on this thread but I think the majority here is saying buy used. I can't remember your budget but I think you are going to have some sticker shock at the boat show. As well those add-ons aren't cheap. A good GPS, trolling motor, VHF, compass, will be up to 2 grand or more for entry level products, another 500 min for lifejackets, fenders, Fire extinguisher, anchor etc. at least."

817982,Steve,2013-11-12 00:37:00,2075,"if you have the coin, buy new, absolutely.  but don't buy a lesser quality boat because its new (and you can afford it) when you can get a three/four year old top quality boat for same price.  if you can buy a top quality boat, and still have it ""new"", then go for it!"
818033,Old Ironmaker,2013-11-12 04:55:00,8243,"A tip I heard years ago is pick out a boat, get his best price, go back and buy that boat from a dealer hopefully as far from TO that you can find. Buy the boat on the showroom floor on the last day of the show. With your best price, not his. He doesn't want to haul it back to kingdom come. Labor alone will be at least $200.00 plus fuel. Hopefully they have the boat that suits your needs at the show? Those boats not at the show will still be for sale after the show, don't let the "" show special prices "" sway you.  I know the frustration of finding a good used boat. Yes there are deals out there but there are dogs for sale too. Some guys are nuts if they think they are going to get what they ask. I could write a book."

818144,Steve,2013-11-13 00:33:00,2075,"it is tough to find a ""good"" used boat.  when you find one, you need to buy it IMMEDIATELY!  i found my lund/yammy tiller combo in the boat trader....the day the issue was released.  i went directly to the house of the private sale and put a deposit on it, which was agreed to be refundable if the boat had leaks...in march we put it in bronte harbour, did a quick tour of the harbour, and completed the sale....  no issues.  i was lucky.  but i JUMPED on it...you can't wait....."

It gets used to store the boat on site at the marina it's at.. nothing else. If he wants new and the ""assumed"" perfect boat that goes with that then we can't sway him.  I can tell you though.. if I had the chance to buy a 2150 Baron second hand, I'd be buying it from me after I worked out all the Bull in deficiencies that Lund put into their prepackage work on my 2007.... let alone setting it up for tracks and everything else.

If one cares for their boat, or anything for that matter there is no problem flogging it when the time comes. I know I'll get what I paid for mine after 4 years of using it, maybe more with the upgrades I've added.  This year I got everyone going when the first time out one of the guys dropped some worm dirt on the carpet, out came the Dust Buster I stuck in a bag on board and I started vacuuming the rug!  I wouldn't want to be around the first time I kissed the dock if I had a new boat, it would kill me. Someone has to buy it new first might as well be Pyro."

816913,grimsbylander,2013-11-05 17:51:00,3016,"I would be very careful buying a boat farther south than Ohio. Just as I wouldn't buy a snowmobile from north country where they have snow and use it almost daily, on the other end a boat from the southern climes may have more than 20 times more the use that a normal family boat might have been used here in our relatively short Ontario summers.<br /><br />Never buy a boat from Florida unless you know the boat and owner personally, yea there are many what appear to be deals there but I know people in Florida that actually take their boats to work everyday on the inter coastal waterways. Coupled with the use in brackish and saltwater it is something to stay away from.  Other than the Florida comment, I don't really agree with this as it's not that cut and dried. You have to be smart regardless of where you buy. I see far too many people in the ""winter"" areas that do not properly winterize their boats. I 'm referring to the motor, lower end, fuel tanks, bilge area, livewells, etc. I'll take a boat out of Kentucky with 100 hours on the motor(easily confirmed) over the same boat here that got a tarp thrown over it until spring. Especially at thousands less money. Also, the guys in the northern states aren't dummies. They buy up deals out of the south and trailer them up to Michigan, New York, Ohio and Pennsylvania and sell them there. They know Canadians would rather not drive to Alabama and a without border crossing, its a cheap flip for them. Regardless of where you buy, you have to do your homework."
816917,grimsbylander,2013-11-05 18:04:00,3016,"Exactly we run Georgian Bay in 16 fters all the time  A 16 foot aluminum is a good boat for Georgian Bay for a couple reasons. Even though it can blow up big time, if you are smart enough to watch the weather forecasts, you're never too far from a shoreline. There's a million places to tuck into and get out of the wind. I fished it for ten years with a 14 foot boat. Even days that had 5 footers in the gap you could launch in Severn, Honey Harbour, etc. and fish back bays. The other reason is mobility...the shallower draft can get you into some awesome spots you just can't fish in a bigger boat and I remember a few great ones. Not as many places to ""hide"" on the western end of Ontario or Erie."
816955,irishfield,2013-11-05 20:41:00,26272,".. and I fished Georgian Bay regularly in a 12' Springbok (car topper!) with a 7.5 Elgin (closepin on choke) for many years with my father in law... the point was he said he and his wife wanted a boat large enough to take their GRANDCHILDREN out on Lake Ontario. That's a whole different game and responsibility.  ..oh and btw my 2150 will go through 11"" of skinny water with the 9.9 running!"

817067,lew,2013-11-06 12:33:00,12766,My brother fished Quinte for 20 years in a 12' tinnie with no issues and that's a place that can also get very nasty. It's all in knowing what your doing and when not to venture out.  There's also guys with 20 footers that aren't qualified to drive a boat on  Grenadier Pond on a quiet summer evening.

804131,sneak_e_pete,2013-08-20 21:31:00,540,I know this is post is a lot of information to absorb...but....sit in the boat...play with it.  I bought a SmokerCraft ProMag 182 which I just sold (awesome boat btw) but the rod compartment didnt fit spinning rods well (guides to big for the tubes).  I never even considered that when I bought it.
804159,fishindevil,2013-08-20 23:14:00,6254,A Lund with a Yamaha four stroke outboard !!!!! And you are set forever !!!!!! Simple as that
804164,hutch4113,2013-08-20 23:25:00,374, Hahahahahaaha.  I have the same problem...never even thought to try a rod in the tube.  However we had what thought was a water leak in my Pro Mag - turned out the speedo hose had popped off and was spraying water up through the front of the boat.  My Dad took the rod tubes out to let the front hull dry off - and I never put them back in.
804178,irishfield,2013-08-21 00:02:00,26272,"  I guess every manufacture can have it's issues... or the owner drilled a hole where it didn't belong. My Lund has been sitting at my dock in Temagami since Mothers day and I've yet to take it out, as we've been elsewhere since June 11th. Full cover is on.. there's not a drop of water in the hull 3 months later as my neighbour checks on it weekly.  Anyone notice the OP hasn't been back?... first post.. no response.. gone elsewhere? What boat is he looking for, a tinny.. a 24' r? Maybe we should wait 'till he tells us. I could use some more Naden dollars, buy one of those!"

804206,Old Ironmaker,2013-08-21 01:32:00,8243,"Angler management,  I really am happy for you with the experience you've had with the legend.  For every consumer product there will be a bad one for the same product. My Starcraft which will be 20 years old soon does take on a bit of water after 8 hours on the lake. My used Lund had a crack in it from stem to stern. Luckily I had the dealer write a short term leak warranty into the sales contract.  Yes it looks like the original OP bought a boat and hasn't returned to shore. Many a new OP post all over the place the same question and forget the original site or username and passwords."
804257,wormdunker,2013-08-21 10:56:00,1711,Lund is an excellent boat.  I bought my first Lund last June - love it!

805390,MrSimon,2013-08-28 21:12:00,217,"Great advice so far.  But you should also check out the G3 V1777.  Its just shy of 18', has lots of great storage, comes in tiller or console, and will be cheaper than Starcraft, Lund and the other top brands."

805682,wannabefisherman,2013-08-30 15:30:00,19,"As I understand, Legend gets their hulls from Smokercraft, but assembles the boats in Sudbury. In most models you can see similarities in the hulls."
805683,wannabefisherman,2013-08-30 15:37:00,19,"My boat is for sale at the end of the season.  it's a 2012 so only used for 2 seasons (from july to October 2012, june to now 2013).  Garage stored in the winter.  It's a Crestliner 1850 Raptor with a 200 hp Optimax.  The boat is loaded up for fishing, with family features - a requirement by the other investor - such as fold up bench seat, swim platform, snap in carpet, full stand up cover.  Tournament ready fishing that easily handles water sports and cruising.  It's a rocket if you want it to be - 57 mph  The boat is in  mint condition.  Crestliner warranty is transferrable.  Motor has a 5 year warranty on it, also transferrable.  So you can get a practically new boat without the price, with full coverage.

806682,mike rousseau,2013-09-07 00:33:00,4661, Warranties are a weird topic for me...   I think it's great they'll fix you boat if it leaks.... But who's gunna get your boat off the bottom if lake O if your boat splits open...?  I may be exaggerating but I think my point is clear...  I like a product that doesn't need warranty work... Then I don't have to worry about my equipment failing me during peak season and being in the shop for 2 months... And fighting with warranty loopholes....  If you go 2-5 years old you'll save so much money you can pretty well fix anything and still save... You can get a great outfit for 15-25k...  My brother got a 20 foot ranger fisherman 620T deep v with a 115hp tiller for 21000... Only 3-4 years old... No issues...  Other perk to buying used... You usually get a fully rigged boat... Sonar/GPS... Trolling motors... Etc...

I have heard about hull cracking. on jan 2014 we r going to Toronto boat show to pick out a new boat just need a little help thanks pyro aka mike"
803916,Roy,2013-08-19 22:46:00,13728,Which style/size are you looking at?
803922,kickingfrog,2013-08-19 23:22:00,8333,"Lots to think about. Good to start now and narrow your search a little before the winter boat show.   Things that most of us work through:   In no particular order (and subject to additions).  Budget Type of fishing you plan to do and the type and size of water Number of people that you plan to have in the boat most of the time Size of tow vehicle (if applicable) New or used Project boat or ready to get wet   And yes, the always heated debate issues (Some of which are partially dependent on the above considerations):  Tiller, side console or full windshield Welded or riveted Fibreglass or Aluminum       "
803929,coolwater,2013-08-20 00:05:00,43," kickingfrog makes some good points, always consider your priorities.  I've had two boats, both based on price, turned out to be junk. Just my opinion."
803936,RickOnt,2013-08-20 00:50:00,669,Yes!!  Budget is usually the #1 determining factor!!  After that Ya can go Nuts!!
803940,mattp33,2013-08-20 01:04:00,290,"I think legend has a lot to offer for the money but i saw some hydro-formed stuff, looks awesome and rides like a glass in big water. I think tracker makes or made it. For some reason I can't see anything on their web site. Do they not make it anymore?"
803941,Richie Razor,2013-08-20 01:04:00,536,"Just be prepared to spend, spend, spend!!!! All boats new or used are money pits. Unless you are goin to be using your boat for commercial fishing, you will never justify the money put in lol. But hey they're fun and from the advertising it seems like chicks in bikinis are attracted to them like moths to a light. You can't lose!"
803942,vance,2013-08-20 01:11:00,719,B.O.A.T acronym for break out another thousand. Just make sure that what ever you buy will fit into where you will park it for the winter.I shopped with a tape measure to make sure it would fit in the garage..  vance
803963,krixxer,2013-08-20 02:22:00,274,how much of your money are we spending?
803988,sneak_e_pete,2013-08-20 04:31:00,540,"I am on my 4th boat.  I have owned 12-18ft, used and brand spanking new.  IMO...used is the way to go.  I literally felt like crying the first time my new boat got its first dock rub, slimed, muddy etc.  I spent more time cleaning it than fishing with it.  Aluminums are tough...if the motor is decent, you can get a great used package that will last forever, retain value better and be a LOT less maintenance.  Feel free to PM with any questions."
804007,fishindevil,2013-08-20 12:56:00,6254,we need to know this ?? as well as tiller or console !!!!!!
804008,davew3,2013-08-20 13:06:00,430,"Take a look at StarCraft.   Well made, deep V style.  Depending on what size you buy, easy to trailer around and handles deep water well.  "
804012,John Bacon,2013-08-20 13:51:00,3277,"I would avoid Tracker boats.  I have heard too many stories about cracked hulls.  They are often nicknamed ""Cracker"" boats.  Sylvan was mentioned; I believe that Sylvan, Smokercraft, and Legend hulls are made in the same factory.  Legend adds their own trip.  I currently own a Princecraft Holiday SC DLX (side console).  It is a little short on internal storage, but it does handle the rough water quite well for a 16 footer.  The boat is also available in double console and tiller models."
804021,hutch4113,2013-08-20 14:15:00,374,"Budget Budget Budget.  And FYI it will probably start creeping up.  As an example, I bought my first boat last year.  My Budget started at 15K - and before I knew it, was up to 20K.  I don't regret what I bought (Smoker Craft Pro Mag 182) - love the boat and love how it handles.  I also had some things that I needed to have in a boat - biggest one being stability.  My wife was hurt in an accident a few years ago, that has many lingering effects.  Needed something that would be stable, etc.  I pretty much started by narrowing down the models I wanted - Full Windshield/walkthrough.  And the brands - Legend, Smokercraft, Princecraft, Sylvan.  (Lund of course - but they were always above my price point).  It was funny how it changed though.  I started looking at 15/16 foot boats, and they all were about what I wanted to spend.  Actually had a line on a nice Princecraft, but could not get the owner to get the boat out so I could look at it (don't really think he wanted to sell).  Then I was pointed to a Marina by a friend, who advised on the boat I did buy.  I saw it beside another boat, that was in the 15/16ft range - and realized that I did not want a 15/16ft boat - I wanted a 18ft - with a 8 foot beam. Hence the budget increase.  Be prepared for that to happen.  But as stated above, I don't regret it at all.  I have been out in Simcoe twice now, where the weather went from calm, to 4/5 foot waves in the blink of an eye - boy was I glad I had the extra size/width.  So I guess the other question to ask is where are you going to fish?  If Big water - buy a big boat. "
804024,Oryx,2013-08-20 14:22:00,186,"Has Tracker not fixed the issue?  I believe, around 2005/6 they bought Fisher boats for their welding technology."
804033,Old Ironmaker,2013-08-20 14:54:00,8243,"I shopped 4 years ago for mine. I hadn't had 1 since divorcing more than 20 years before.  My list for deciding what to buy,  * budget, no sence looking at 45K boats if I only have 15 to spend, other than to see what you get for 45K, you might be surprised how little.  * purpose, hard to take the family out for a day boating on a 14' aluminum if it's important for the whole family to share. If you are fishing slop and back bays, a 20' deep V might not be what you need.  Towabilty* if you have the family mini van and not a 4x4 a heavier glass or aluminum deep V is useless when you can't get it out of a steep ramp. If the closest ramp that will handle your boat is 20 miles from the cottage and is 18 bucks per launch you might think about something you can launch from a neighbours locally.  * Annual cost  Buying the boat is least expensive part of ownership. Without any breakdowns I can tell you that between dockage , a slip for 2 years, fuel for tow vehicle which really goes up on my truck when pulling a 19 footer, fuel for the boat, gas treatment, batteries, 2 stroke oil, $72.00 a gallon approx. Electronic upgrades, rod holders, downriggers, it will happen. Basic annual maintenance, plugs, wires, fogging agent, and, and, and. I spend about $4000.00 a season using the boat once a week from May 1st to October 1st. Use the boat more then more than 4 grand. That's $200.00 per week, or per day for 5 months. I am being conservative here, it's really closer to 300 a week without repairs and using it more than once a week.  I purchased used because I could get the same boat for 30% of what they wanted for the same boat new. It was very difficult to find mine. Great condition and all the bells and whistles.  I guess what I'm saying here is the expense of boat ownership goes far beyond plopping down cash at a dealer. It's cost afterward per every dollar of original purchase price is the highest per dollar for a vehicle other than an airplane or race car.  Edit, and if you think you're buddies are going to chip in for gas you are nuts. Maybe at the beginning. They will think because you own new boat your rich. Splitting on gas sure isn't splitting on cost. If you make it clear this is what it will cost you will find many are too busy to fish anylonger. As they say, been there done that."
804036,John Bacon,2013-08-20 15:09:00,3277," That is possible, but I would still be reluctant to chance it.  I did a quick web search on Fisher boats and they seem to have a bad reputation too.  I would stick to riveted hulls."
804055,fishnsled,2013-08-20 16:25:00,3520,"x2   I would not chance them either after what my buddy went through.  Now I personally would not avoid a welded hull as I have a Crestliner.  Now I've heard stories about them having problems as well but after having mine for 12 seasons, I have no complaints about the hull leaking.  I've had the front livewell pump crack in the first year I had it (do to a hose that was putting to much strain on the pump) and put water in the boat (fixed under warranty and still working today) and the rear livewell that had the switch bumped while out of the water and melted the pump a bit and opened up the top seal allowing water to come in.  Replaced the pump myself and all was good again.  There's a lot of good info here and most of it will come down to your budget."
804068,JoshS,2013-08-20 16:57:00,729,"Some pretty good used deals out there especially south of the border if you're into saving money! That's what I'd do. Just make sure you do a diligent inspection, get the engine checked out, make sure there's no rot/mold, carpets good etc. You'll get a lot more for your money and have more for all the accessories you're gonna want!  Sylvan/starcraft/smokercraft are made in the same factory I believe, not legends. I think Sylvan stopped making fishing boats however  Crestliner, Princecraft and of course Lunds all are up there in the top and have some really nice new models. It all comes down to budget and your needs.  But if budget is any issue, there is way more value in a used package!"
804069,davew3,2013-08-20 17:04:00,430,Another item to think about is what type of trailer do you want.   Bunks or rollers or a combination.   How high off the ground does the trailer have the boat? I have an e-z load where I do not need much water to load and unload.  Regards
804072,BillM,2013-08-20 17:34:00,17367,"Buy used, so much more bang for the buck, especially from the US."
804074,Old Ironmaker,2013-08-20 17:41:00,8243,"I would be very careful buying a boat farther south than Ohio. Just as I wouldn't buy a snowmobile from north country where they have snow and use it almost daily, on the other end a boat from the southern climes may have more than 20 times more the use that a normal family boat might have been used here in our relatively short Ontario summers.<br /><br />Never buy a boat from Florida unless you know the boat and owner personally, yea there are many what appear to be deals there but I know people in Florida that actually take their boats to work everyday on the inter coastal waterways. Coupled with the use in brackish and saltwater it is something to stay away from. There is a dealer here in Norfolk that gets many of his boats at southern auctions, cheap. Cleans them up, does some interior repairs and sells them at our Ontario prices. I almost bought one before I made him show me where it came from. He was reluctant to do so, when he did I found it was from Ft. Myers where there is only brackish water and saltwater. He said it didn't matter, I say it does, no deal.<br /><br />I would also, stay away from Legend boats. They sure look like all the others but just aren't. One of those Miata's or any Pontiac convertibles look like sportscars, they aren't.<br /><br />Lund, Starcraft, Crestliner, Princecraft. For quality aluminum choose one, you can't go wrong and will have confidence in them 15 miles out on Lake Erie in 2 meter waves if you get caught one day, and you will if you frequent big water.<br /><br />I've heard the stories of new Legends talking on water after a bout with big waves on Erie.<br /><br />One thing I would want is an auto bilge on anything other than a small tin can. A bilge on anything with a covered floor minimum.<br /><br />If you can afford it, I'd buy a smaller boat with a 4 stroke than a bigger boat with a 2 stroke in the future if I was shopping today.<br /><br />You will get 2 footitis, we all get it, fight it off, there isn't any prescription for it. You are probably already afflicted with this awful disease."
804079,Angler management,2013-08-20 17:58:00,280,"Absolutely love my Legend... 2001 and i have never had an issue. No clie how their welded new models are but the trim work quality in mine is still flawless and have never had a drop of water leak into the boat. Also the layout and storage i still have not come across any other aluminum that i liked better. They all seem much cheaper built, and craftsmanship is unmatched. A month or so ago, we launched our boat at the same time as a couple of fishing show hosts did, brand new Lund predator with massive merc and all the toys... We both also pulled out of water at the same time after about 8hrs, and watched him pull the plug. He was in shock when he saw about a hundred gallons of water bursting out. When we pulled out our plug and didnt have a drop come out, he laughed and said "" guess they just dont make them like they used to eh?"" On the drive home we followed his trail of water for about 5km. Lol"
804098,craigdritchie,2013-08-20 20:09:00,1586," Absolutely agree. Starcraft makes a great boat that is well known for its ability to handle rough water.    Sylvan, Starcraft, SmokerCraft and at least some Legend models are all built in the same factory in New Paris, Indiana. I've taken the tour of the production lines, and seen all four brands in various stages of production.  Although these different brands are all built at the same factory, it's important to note that manufacturing techniques are quite different for each. Starcraft boats, for example, use an internal framework that is partially assembled before it is installed into the empty hull, where SmokerCrafts have the framing constructed inside the hull from the start. There are different advantages to each method, and the result is that each brand rides a bit differently in the water. You can click here to read an article I wrote for Boatguide magazine in 2012  that shows exactly how they're made.  Josh is correct ... Sylvan no longer sells aluminum fishing boats. Their pontoons are very popular - to the point they seriously can't build them fast enough and simply needed more manufacturing space, so the fishing boats (which were a small part of Sylvan's business) got the boot."
804114,Angler management,2013-08-20 20:54:00,280,My Legend actually has a stamp that says smokercraft. And the serial number starts with SMK.
