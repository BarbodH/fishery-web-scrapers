832796,Photoz,2014-01-26 21:14:00,792,"Dumb question time . . .   I bought a Vexilar FL-20 back in 2009, only got to use it about 6 times, then mothballed it for the last 5 years, only taking it out around Thanksgiving, throwing it on the charger, the little green light comes on, showing 'full charge?' I know the RED light should come on if it isn't fully charged, and I thought it only came on green when fully charged? Could this battery have held a full charge FOR 5 YEARS?? I figured the life of one of these 9 volt batteries would be 3 or 4  years max . . . . but 5 YEARS . . . . .    is this possible?"
832798,buckster,2014-01-26 21:29:00,530,I have went through a few batteries with my vex over the years.    A few times the green light would come on right away when in fact the battery was dead.   Usually my cue to get a new battery.
832799,BillM,2014-01-26 21:30:00,17367,"Sounds like the battery is toast, time to get a new one."

832812,adempsey,2014-01-26 23:16:00,1498,"Best way is to measure the voltage of the battery.  I assume it's a 12V SLA AGM battery?  It should read 12.6V+ fully charged , and usually 13V+ immediately after fully charged."

You can test the battery with a light bulb from a car or simply with the vexilar"
832903,icefisher,2014-01-27 14:13:00,5,"Should likely be able to use the one of those trouble lights with the alligotor clips on the vexilar battery to see if it has any life.  I am thinking yours is pooched.  When I bought mine the shop must have used it as a demo and the battery was dead because they didn't keep it charged up.  I brought it back and they gave me a new battery.  I always bring it in after a day on ice let it warm up overnight then charge it back to full the next day.  Even in the summer I will charge it a couple of times to keep it charged.  It's 5years old and I ice fish for 7hrs yesterday and it only went down to 75% charge.   Sorry hope it isn't, but remember is you get a new one to keep it charged after every use."
832905,Photoz,2014-01-27 14:45:00,792,"A rather simple solution . . . .    HOOK THE THING UP PROPERLY. I had forgot I have to turn it on to charge it!! Oh yeah . . . .   .  .  surprise, surprise, the battery WAS toast! Does anyone know if you can get a small van on the ice at Gilford, or Roches Point?  P. S.  Misfish . . . .   because of weather conditions, it could be a while before I get up there, and I don't wish to have  you running all over hell's half acre, trying to find me. I do appreciate the offer, and I thank you very much."
