It was full of large fish, but even with so many the net was not torn. 12 Jesus said to them, “Come and have breakfast.” None of the disciples dared ask him, “Who are you?” They knew it was the Lord.13 Jesus came, took the bread and gave it to them, and did the same with the fish. 14 This was now the third time Jesus appeared to his disciples after he was raised from the dead."

Online they are there over and over being as insulting as possible with closed minds and rants though, and I have had one guy go into a 15 minute rant at a company lunch just seeing the small cross I wear sometimes.  I have never had any religious person (and I have discussed religion with many different religions) even the ones that show up at the door be as insulting and arrogant and intollerant of discussion as the atheists.  Ask an atheist why they won't believe and they mutter something about fairy tales (ignoring the empirical), look here and we see a father above actually proud of his daughter or being rude and insulting....  years ago I might not have agreed but its seems to me that many atheists are so blindly sure of their faith Josh McDowell's comments about some of the hard core atheist is very true that they would choose Hell over God and in the end it is more a moral choice not the evidence.   When some can look at the origin of the Universe that the Bible had more correct than scientists 60 years ago, that cell membranes, enzymes, proteins, and DNA can for by chance.... seems to me it takes more faith to be an atheist and they cannot stand it questioned so end up insulting and mocking rather than thinking and discussing.  Now before someone goes off an their next insult, chew on this if you are willing to let any light in.  ""If I had no other data than the early chapters of Genesis, some of the Psalms and other passages of Scripture, I would have arrived at essentially the same picture of the origin of the universe, as is indicated by the scientific data."" Nobel Prize-winning physicist Arno Penzias (Big Bang Theorist)  ""The principle of [divine] purpose ... stares the biologist in the face wherever he looks ... . The probability for such an event as the origin of DNA molecules to have occurred by sheer chance is just too small to be seriously considered ... .""Ernst Boris Chain - Nobel Prize in medicine"

The one guy I knew said clearly in an agruement about the values of respect and human life that only those that were of use to him were of value, reminded me of the story of Corrie Ten Boom at Ravensbruck....  then there was the guy at the company lunch (drunk every weekend and sleeping with anything in a skirt) who spent 15 minutes ranting just seeing the cross I wear.....    atheists like Richard Dawkins says he doesn't think religions people deserve respect and I see that from many more and more, I can see more and more how men like Hitler, Stalin and Mao were able to impose their agendas, devalue human life and make your followers think only their ""superiority"" and of ""the others"" as somehow subhuman.

830700,MrSimon,2014-01-15 17:37:00,217,"I don't understand why those who oppose the Bible do so in such a vehement and insulting way.  Basically, the Bible says:  1.  God created us, loves us, and gave us free will to make our own decisions in life 2.  We choose poorly and made a bid dang mess of things 3.  God provided a way out of the big dang mess through His Son, Jesus 4.  If we accept that gift, we are then called to live a moral, responsible life and to love others and to love truth  You certainly don't have to believe the story ... that's totally your right.  But I just don't understand all the Bible bashing that goes on (even on this site).  Its a book about sacrifice, responsibility, accountability, and unconditional love.  You can't go wrong with that stuff.  Granted ... there are a lot of people out there claiming to be ""Christians"" that sure don't live their lives according to the Bible.  Shame on them.

It was also curious because Al selectively heralds quotes from other Scientists (Einstein recently) when it conforms to his point of view and he is looking for greater credibility.  The phrase ""in for a penny, in for a pound"" is not on his or Bible literalists radar(with thanks to Grimace). I also agree that it is his show, but I don't agree that he is free to do as he pleases.  He is at the mercy and discretion of his sponsors.  Rehashing the old arguments is pointless.

God created us, loves us, and gave us free will to make our own decisions in life 2.  We choose poorly and made a bid dang mess of things 3.  God provided a way out of the big dang mess through His Son, Jesus 4.  If we accept that gift, we are then called to live a moral, responsible life and to love others and to love truth  You certainly don't have to believe the story ... that's totally your right.  But I just don't understand all the Bible bashing that goes on (even on this site).  Its a book about sacrifice, responsibility, accountability, and unconditional love.  You can't go wrong with that stuff.  Granted ... there are a lot of people out there claiming to be ""Christians"" that sure don't live their lives according to the Bible.  Shame on them.  So before you start bashing the Bible, Christians, or religion as a whole .... I'd encourage you to use that ""open mind"" I keep reading about and do some actual research.   have you read the bible, cover to cover? it is not a book about love IMO, it's a book about control  most Christians have not even read the bible, which I find truly mind blowing, believing in something they've never read...blind faith  I grew up in a Christian household, by grade 7 I had read enough to make my own decision and I do NOT believe....I've lost friends I grew up with because I don't believe, never had an argument or threw insults at each other, but because I don't believe, I'm going to hell, and they don't want my devil influences in their life  when my grandfather passed away, it took my grandmother 7 yrs before she met another man...after less than 1 month of both of them attending our Baptist church together, they were asked not to return unless they planned on having the pastor marry them  I believe in faith and spirituality, but not religion...religion is written by man, to control man...nothing more and nothing less"

Very true, it takes an honest and open mind to be willing to search but at an emotional level many don't want to know.  The actual reality is they are slaves to self and want to serve self only, pride is what the ex-atheist C.S. Lewis calls the worst sin as it is a sin of the heart rather than the flesh.   ""I did it my way"" is the theme song for many today... ""and not as one that kneels"" being a line I remember in there, humblinlg themselves, kneeling, accepting responsibilty/repentance  and the reality even with all the suffering in the world there is hope, meaning and mercy is truly a hated idea especially that part that comes with it, responsibility (blame someone/thing else is prefered).  Grimace's out of context texts would be completely laughable if it wasn't for the sad fact it shows a search for excuses and mockery.   It is interesting to see some of the ex-atheist Christian speakers today, Josh McDowell was an atheist and was challenged and spent two years writing the ""The evidence that requires a verdict"" that ended up being his book about how he became a Christian, he actually says it is a moral not an evidential decision. Lee Strobel started out writing a book attacking Christianity and ended up writing ""The Case for Christ"" and many more since his conversion. Even Christopher Hitchen's brother Peter grew up an atheist and with one of the most out spoken atheist brothers when he decided to search became a Christian..... like C.S. Lewis, Alister McGrath, Malcolmm Muggridge and many other ex-atheists there is a hope for them but given the viseral and emotional reactions they look for any excuse to not look at all because most really, really do not want there to be a God and especially Jesus."
830433,captpierre,2014-01-14 15:51:00,2521,"Guys.  We are all seeking Truth.  Why are we here?  Is there a God?  If there is, what does this God want of me?  Am I accountable to God?  Is there an eternity or do we just rot after we die and that's the end of us.  If there is eternity,  what happens after I die?  The Christian, Jewish and Islamic faiths teach that there is a God, and an eternity.  A Godless one, Hell.  And one in which God dwells,  Heaven.  After much study, I have come to the conclusion that God is real, and there is more to us than just this body and life. As a Christian, I have found ample evidence in the historical accuaracy of the Bible.  The clear fulfilment of prophecy (predictions) made centuries before they came to pass.  Lots of heavy duty scientists, after pursueing the meaning of their existance, have come to the same conclusion.  Many have not. But IMO it takes as much faith to believe in Evolutionary Theory, and that we are all here by chance, than  it does to believe in a Creator.  I think it is important for all of us to sort this stuff out.  There may be eternal consequences.  It's easy to blow this stuff off.   But, intellectual laziness and following the crowd is not an excuse when you stand before God one day and have to answer for your life.  For those that want to learn more, start with reading Lee Strobel's   ""Evidence for God""  Written by a former atheist.  We are all students of,   and love,   nature.   I choose to believe it was created- not sure how, exactly.    You can certainly believe otherwise.  Nuff said,   Peter"

As evidenced by this thread, its an un-popular stance and he risks loosing viewers, which could cost him money.  I am impressed by his boldness.  We could all use more of it.  Al and Ron both led pretty rough lives for a long time and got themselves into some pretty big trouble.  Alcoholism and more.  Now they lead good clean lives, run a successful business, and have good family values.  According to them, the big turn-around was a direct result of their acceptance of Jesus Christ as the son of God.  So apparently religion had a very large and very good impact on their lives.  And they are telling other people about it in hopes their lives can change too.  Good for them!!  As to Al dissing evolution ..... well, he believes in the Bible, and the Bible clearly states that the Earth and humans were created by God, and that evolution is false.  Those are his beliefs.

""He could not answer the strongest argument against it, which had been made nearly two thousand years earlier by Aristotle: If heliocentrism were true, then there would be observable parallax shifts in the stars’ positions as the earth moved in its orbit around the sun. However, given the technology of Galileo’s time, no such shifts in their positions could be observed. It would require more sensitive measuring equipment than was available in Galileo’s day to document the existence of these shifts, given the stars’ great distance. Until then, the available evidence suggested that the stars were fixed in their positions relative to the earth, and, thus, that the earth and the stars were not moving in space—only the sun, moon, and planets were.""  The Heliocentric theory required many more years and larger telescopes to allow for measurement of the plants motions.  It wasn't until Hubble that the red shift was identifiable and this is what led to the Big Bang theory, which contravened with the constant state universe and even Einstein came out against the redshift at first until he actually sat down and reviewed it with Hubble.

You may also purchase the children of such resident foreigners, including those who have been born in your land.  You may treat them as your property, passing them on to your children as a permanent inheritance.  You may treat your slaves like this, but the people of Israel, your relatives, must never be treated this way.  (Leviticus 25:44-46 NLT)  If you buy a Hebrew slave, he is to serve for only six years.  Set him free in the seventh year, and he will owe you nothing for his freedom.  If he was single when he became your slave and then married afterward, only he will go free in the seventh year.  But if he was married before he became a slave, then his wife will be freed with him.  If his master gave him a wife while he was a slave, and they had sons or daughters, then the man will be free in the seventh year, but his wife and children will still belong to his master.  But the slave may plainly declare, 'I love my master, my wife, and my children.  I would rather not go free.'  If he does this, his master must present him before God.  Then his master must take him to the door and publicly pierce his ear with an awl.  After that, the slave will belong to his master forever.  (Exodus 21:2-6 NLT)  When a man sells his daughter as a slave, she will not be freed at the end of six years as the men are.  If she does not please the man who bought her, he may allow her to be bought back again.  But he is not allowed to sell her to foreigners, since he is the one who broke the contract with her.  And if the slave girl's owner arranges for her to marry his son, he may no longer treat her as a slave girl, but he must treat her as his daughter.  If he himself marries her and then takes another wife, he may not reduce her food or clothing or fail to sleep with her as his wife.  If he fails in any of these three ways, she may leave as a free woman without making any payment.  (Exodus 21:7-11 NLT)  When a man strikes his male or female slave with a rod so hard that the slave dies under his hand, he shall be punished.  If, however, the slave survives for a day or two, he is not to be punished, since the slave is his own property.  (Exodus 21:20-21 NAB)  Christians who are slaves should give their masters full respect so that the name of God and his teaching will not be shamed.  If your master is a Christian, that is no excuse for being disrespectful.  You should work all the harder because you are helping another believer by your efforts.  Teach these truths, Timothy, and encourage everyone to obey them.  (1 Timothy 6:1-2 NLT) Slaves, obey your earthly masters with deep respect and fear.  Serve them sincerely as you would serve Christ.  (Ephesians 6:5 NLT)  So they sent twelve thousand warriors to Jabesh-gilead with orders to kill everyone there, including women and children.  ""This is what you are to do,"" they said. ""Completely destroy all the males and every woman who is not a virgin.""  Among the residents of Jabesh-gilead they found four hundred young virgins who had never slept with a man, and they brought them to the camp at Shiloh in the land of Canaan.  The Israelite assembly sent a peace delegation to the little remnant of Benjamin who were living at the rock of Rimmon. Then the men of Benjamin returned to their homes, and the four hundred women of Jabesh-gilead who were spared were given to them as wives.  But there were not enough women for all of them.  The people felt sorry for Benjamin because the LORD had left this gap in the tribes of Israel.  So the Israelite leaders asked, ""How can we find wives for the few who remain, since all the women of the tribe of Benjamin are dead?  There must be heirs for the survivors so that an entire tribe of Israel will not be lost forever.  But we cannot give them our own daughters in marriage because we have sworn with a solemn oath that anyone who does this will fall under God's curse.""  Then they thought of the annual festival of the LORD held in Shiloh, between Lebonah and Bethel, along the east side of the road that goes from Bethel to Shechem.  They told the men of Benjamin who still needed wives, ""Go and hide in the vineyards.  When the women of Shiloh come out for their dances, rush out from the vineyards, and each of you can take one of them home to be your wife!  And when their fathers and brothers come to us in protest, we will tell them, 'Please be understanding.  Let them have your daughters, for we didn't find enough wives for them when we destroyed Jabesh-gilead. And you are not guilty of breaking the vow since you did not give your daughters in marriage to them.'""  So the men of Benjamin did as they were told.  They kidnapped the women who took part in the celebration and carried them off to the land of their own inheritance.  Then they rebuilt their towns and lived in them.  So the assembly of Israel departed by tribes and families, and they returned to their own homes.  They attacked Midian just as the LORD had commanded Moses, and they killed all the men.  All five of the Midianite kings – Evi, Rekem, Zur, Hur, and Reba – died in the battle.  They also killed Balaam son of Beor with the sword.  Then the Israelite army captured the Midianite women and children and seized their cattle and flocks and all their wealth as plunder.  They burned all the towns and villages where the Midianites had lived.  After they had gathered the plunder and captives, both people and animals, they brought them all to Moses and Eleazar the priest, and to the whole community of Israel, which was camped on the plains of Moab beside the Jordan River, across from Jericho.  Moses, Eleazar the priest, and all the leaders of the people went to meet them outside the camp.  But Moses was furious with all the military commanders who had returned from the battle.  ""Why have you let all the women live?"" he demanded.  ""These are the very ones who followed Balaam's advice and caused the people of Israel to rebel against the LORD at Mount Peor.  They are the ones who caused the plague to strike the LORD's people.  Now kill all the boys and all the women who have slept with a man.  Only the young girls who are virgins may live; you may keep them for yourselves.  As you approach a town to attack it, first offer its people terms for peace.  If they accept your terms and open the gates to you, then all the people inside will serve you in forced labor.  But if they refuse to make peace and prepare to fight, you must attack the town.  When the LORD your God hands it over to you, kill every man in the town.  But you may keep for yourselves all the women, children, livestock, and other plunder.  You may enjoy the spoils of your enemies that the LORD your God has given you.  If a man is caught in the act of raping a young woman who is not engaged, he must pay fifty pieces of silver to her father.  Then he must marry the young woman because he violated her, and he will never be allowed to divorce her.  2 Samuel 12:11-14 NAB Thus says the Lord: 'I will bring evil upon you out of your own house.  I will take your wives [plural] while you live to see it, and will give them to your neighbor.  He shall lie with your wives in broad daylight.  You have done this deed in secret, but I will bring it about in the presence of all Israel, and with the sun looking down.' Then David said to Nathan, ""I have sinned against the Lord.""  Nathan answered David: ""The Lord on his part has forgiven your sin: you shall not die.  But since you have utterly spurned the Lord by this deed, the child born to you must surely die.""  Deuteronomy 21:10-14 NAB ""When you go out to war against your enemies and the LORD, your God, delivers them into your hand, so that you take captives, if you see a comely woman among the captives and become so enamored of her that you wish to have her as wife, you may take her home to your house.  But before she may live there, she must shave her head and pare her nails and lay aside her captive's garb.  After she has mourned her father and mother for a full month, you may have relations with her, and you shall be her husband and she shall be your wife.  However, if later on you lose your liking for her, you shall give her her freedom, if she wishes it; but you shall not sell her or enslave her, since she was married to you under compulsion.""  Great book.  Worship it."

830415,NAW,2014-01-14 13:59:00,4022,"I saw this on OFC (of all places) a few years back.  On a thread, just minutes before it was locked down...  Something that stuck with me.   ""If you are hungry, I will offer you food If you are thirsty, I will offer you water If you are Cold, I will offer you warmth If you are in need, ask and I will give If you are in trouble, ask and I will help  I do not do these things in hopes of being rewarded, or in fear of being punished. I do these things because I know them to be right. I set my own standards, and I alone enforce them.""  Kind of sums up how a feel about being a slave to religion.  I don't need a book to tell me to be a good person, to have morals, and family values."
830053,farsider,2014-01-12 20:17:00,456,"On todays Angling Edge, at the end when he gives his sermon, Al Lindner questioned the veracity of evolution.  Personally, I have always hated this part of his ""fishing"" show and think it is out of place for a fishing show.  Usually, it is a somewhat benign recitation of verse or parable.  He was making a glib comment about peoples family trees and whether some more branches should include apes, chipmunks, mosquito, goo, etc.  (Well reasoned Al )  I found it particularly off-putting.

Making claims that evolutionary theory is flawed and believing in creationism are two different things. One is asking questions based on the scientific method, the other is denying scientific theory for a leap of faith.  Don't get me wrong, I have no problem with faith, only with people who use faith as a reason to deny logical reasoning."
830123,mosquito,2014-01-13 01:31:00,111,"Good for him, so are many scientists questioning the standard evolutionary theory, Stephen Gould talks about sporadic bursts of evolution rather than the standard model and to go further for that matter, even Richard Dawkins in his book call the blind watchmaker on the first page says that there is the appearance of design in the cells.  Science was built on questioning but for so many to question one of the legs so many unquestioningly stand on obviously has a very emotional response, to question their faith in it is not allowed and Linder is right there is no tolerance of a Biblical world view and on and on those intolerant of it will rant unquestioningly without actually being willing to investigate what is true.  Sadly most of them probably still think the Haekle embryo images (admitted fraud before 1900, in science text for decades and listed in Science mag. as one of the top 10 frauds along with Nebraska man etc.) were real and haven't learned more than they knew in grade 9, but for those interested in looking I like the book  ""Dawkins' GOD: Genes, Memes, and the Meaning of Life"" but the science is probably above most who ""trust"" in science, it is written by Alister McGrath (Phd Molecluar Biophysics), in the review of the book by Francis Collins, Director of the Human Genome Project he said: ""Wielding evolutionary arguments and carefully chosen metaphors like sharp swords, Richard Dawkins has emerged over three decades as this generation's most aggressive promoter of atheism. In his view, science, and science alone, provides the only rock worth standing on. In this remarkable book, Alister McGrath challenges Dawkins on the very ground he holds most sacred - rational argument - and McGrath disarms the master. It becomes readily apparent that Dawkins has aimed his attack at a naive version of faith that most serious believers would not recognize. After reading this carefully constructed and eloquently written book, Dawkins' choice of atheism emerges as the most irrational of the available choices about God's existence."" Universe popping into existence, cell membranes with DNA and protein synthesis all by chance.....  all in the realities of entropic principals, instability of complex molecules etc......seems to be more of a moral choice to reject God and takes alot more faith it seems to be an atheist.  ""The principle of [divine] purpose ... stares the biologist in the face wherever he looks ... . The probability for such an event as the origin of DNA molecules to have occurred by sheer chance is just too small to be seriously considered ... .""Ernst Boris Chain - Nobel Prize in medicine"
