832232,JoshS,2014-01-23 19:36:00,729,"Whatever you use seal it well with an epoxy resin or spar urethane. Don't need marine grade plywood. I did a lot of research on it last year when I decided to redo my boat interior, did 4 coats of spar urethane on my existing wood and it's glassed over nicely, seems invincible. You also don't need to replace everything, if your wood's not rotten (you'll know after it dries out and you sand off the glue), just seal the crap out of it and reuse it. Maybe you only need to redo the transom if you're lucky."
832238,davew3,2014-01-23 20:43:00,430,PT plywood is not the answer eh?   well maybe just plain 3/4 inch with  a sealant coating. we will see in a couple of months. Thanks for the info.  Regards

Beware when you mix the foam it expands like CRAZY and you have to work fast to get it spread correctly or you will have a mess!  http://www.noahsmarine.com/  I did my floor a few years ago and I see they have some new 3M products that look like a good floor replacement too. http://www.noahsmarine.com/items.asp?Cc=33  They also ship if that is your only option.

832552,moxie,2014-01-25 13:48:00,1566,"I thought treated and marine ply are two different things. Buy the thickness you need, coat the entire piece of wood and as someone stated a dab of silicone any screw or bolt hole. Will last years."
832557,mosquito,2014-01-25 15:17:00,111,It all depends on how long you want it to last and the skills you have and the type/age of boat.  You can go cheap on a tinny and replace it in 5 years or if you have a better boat and want to use it for decades more the other end of the spectrum is the 3M products.  I would say stay away from exterior grade plywood unless it is a tinny and a beater and anything pressure treated is just asking for problems.  If it is a wood boat or if you need to replace the foam under the floor (the foam in mine had got old enought it was more a sponge) or more complicated repairs and have a good boat then talking to several of the guys at boat repair shops and stores that sell and work on the boats is a good idea. This time of year you might even get a deal on them doing the work for you.

484013,SlowPoke,2010-07-10 03:39:00,2984, Home Depot doesn't carry marine grade plywood. You may be confusing it with exterior grade. Hamilton Plywood is where I got mine.... $120 for 4x8x3/4 iirc.
484015,OhioFisherman,2010-07-10 04:00:00,6623,"""Wood used in boats-teak very expensive,south american mahogany a little less expensive than teak""  Ya but you are going to be hard pressed these days to find a boat with teak or mahogany on it for anything other than trim. They aren`t using it for filler in transoms or for decks on boats, well maybe if the boat has a million dollar price tag.  My 75 SeaRay Sundancer had some small pieces of teak trim on it, and I bought a 4x8 sheet of teak faced marine plywood and rebuilt the cockpit seat, it was like $128.00 back in the early 80`s.  Glue a couple of pieces of plywood together to get the right thickness, use water proof glue cut it, varnish the heck out of it and you should be good for 10 years."

484068,smally21,2010-07-10 12:24:00,993,"8 inches times 48 inches times 1 inches + waste = about 3.5 board feet of lumber. i pay about 2$ a board foot so its a 7-8 dollar board. i can buy an inch and a quarter board at about 6 places within 15 minutes of my house, plane it to one inch in about 5 minutes, cover it in spar varnish and the boat will fall apart around it. all im getting at is lets not overcomplicate it, if you have a buddy with a planer find a local mill or lumber supply and pick out a piece you like - if you're anywhere near hamilton pm me and we'll set you up in the lumber of your choice. of course it may be easier just to laminate some ply and be prepared to repeat ovber the years. good luck."
484076,Dutch,2010-07-10 13:36:00,831,"The ""correct"" way to do it is to use marine grade and cover it in resin/fiberglass although what most guys are saying will probably work as well, just won't last or be as permanent.  The advantage mg has is that it is very dense - there aren't voids in the various layers of wood which can create a spot for water to hold if it does get wet at some point.  The layers are put together with water proof glue that won't let go if it does get wet and those layers are also thinner so there are more of them than in a standard 3/4"" sheet.  I rebuilt the transom in an older bass boat - 2 1/4"" thick - 3 courses of marine grade ply offset.  Took about 1.5 sheets.  When all assembled, it weighed maybe 125 pounds.  It is heavy stuff."

832208,dave524,2014-01-23 16:43:00,4508,"The difference between marine plywood and exterior grade fir plywood is in the quality of the plys put together to make the plywood, no knots or voids, the weather resistance and glues are  the same. The only application where a marine plywood is required is if the actual hull is made of plywood, like those Sea Fleas that were built from plans in Mechanics Illustrated back in the 50's, especially where there is bending of the sheet going on. For a transon the regular exterior grade fir ( not fur  ) will be fine. Don't use pressure treated plywood if the hull is aluminum, electrolysis is nasty."
