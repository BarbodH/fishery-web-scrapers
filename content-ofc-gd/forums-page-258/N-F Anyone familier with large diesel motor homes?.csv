833324,OhioFisherman,2014-01-29 05:16:00,6623,Are engine block heaters a standard item on them?
833341,Whopper,2014-01-29 12:15:00,2174,"Paul it may depend on where it was made. For you and your area it's a must have. We bought a bucket truck here awhile back that came from out west and it didn't have one, needless to say the company had to get one installed"
833342,Fisherman,2014-01-29 12:16:00,7201,"It should be there, some install them but cheap out an don't install the power cord, check the frost plugs."
833352,aplumma,2014-01-29 13:10:00,6896,Nope not standard all of the diesels I have bought have it listed in the options section.    Art
833354,Muskieman,2014-01-29 13:22:00,2472,"Probably not , I sold auto parts for many years and have seldom seen a diesel come stock with a block heater , oil pan heater yes , block heater no ."
833365,Musky or Specks,2014-01-29 14:03:00,2710,I work for Freightiner and not a standard item. What kind of engine is in it Detroit  or Cummins?
833407,OhioFisherman,2014-01-29 18:40:00,6623,"Thanks guys, it is not mine and is not in my area. A friend outside my area bought it new in 2006, can't drive it, and is thinking about unloading it. My experience has been with heavy trucks in my area, most had block heaters or perhaps oil heaters.  Just from looking at the specs for 2006 models like it I don't see any mention of block or oil heaters standard. It was purchased in South Carolina, so I am guessing there isn't a big demand for them there?  Engine? again from the specs, a 350 HP cat diesel, I have no idea if other engines were optional.  LOL, women should stick to buying shoes and purses, or other less expensive things they don't use? I am not much help to her with this and the concept is a bit beyond me. You spent 180k for something you can't drive and don't use?"
833409,BillM,2014-01-29 18:59:00,17367,"If you decided to buy it, get a Temro Zerostart Coolant heater (Or even better a Espar)"
833419,OhioFisherman,2014-01-29 19:44:00,6623,"No, not me Bill, I have about as much use for one now as I do for a boat. Just trying to help her figure out options for unloading it."
833420,BillM,2014-01-29 19:47:00,17367,Gotcha
833445,Musky or Specks,2014-01-29 22:13:00,2710,Espar preheater is the way to go.
