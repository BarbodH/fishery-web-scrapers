833102,GBW,2014-01-28 02:59:00,8460,Hey all  Anyone have access to parts for a Samsung heat pump model # aqv24nsdx (that is the outdoor unit # on the manual) and it needs a new motherboard. S/N y0zapaeb300022w. My fathers heat pump is pooched and his current service provider cannot give him an answer about the part time frame or anything.  He's now thinking of just ordering it and replacing it on his own even though it should be covered under warranty.  Thanks!!!  G

I can get it for you, but honestly, you can order online at Repair Clinic for less, and they have it in stock. Just be sure that that is what is defective because they do not accept installed parts for credit."
