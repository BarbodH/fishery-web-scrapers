I remember playing hockey at both of these spots as a little kid but that was like 10 years ago and for the most part I remember both being pretty shallow. Has anybody ever tried fishing at these spots before?  On a side note i was fishing at bayfront in hamilton a few weeks ago and caught 8 perch on a minnow and split shot rig. I havent been back but i could probably walk out farther now to the deeper water"
833136,Broker,2014-01-28 12:31:00,482,"I'm not 100% sure, but I don't think cootes is worth fishing as it is too shallow, If you were catchin fishing a couple weeks ago, I would head back to where you had success instead of cootes. Or try Binbrook for some crappie."
833156,chris.brock,2014-01-28 15:15:00,4053,"like Shasta said, I wouldn't bother with Cootes, unless you know a spot that's a deeper hole  trying around the high level bridge or Valley Inn Rd sounds like a better plan, these are current areas though so be super careful  let us know how you do, if you go"
833190,Mike Pike,2014-01-28 18:47:00,1332,Cootes is a uniformly shallow bay with few features and few fish.  There are so many other places where you'd have much better luck and much better shot at fish that I wouldn't bother.
833385,northernpike56,2014-01-29 16:05:00,717,"Thanks guys, sounds like I may be best to stick with bayfront then because its pretty well known, and safe too. Plus a nice variety of fish to catch"
