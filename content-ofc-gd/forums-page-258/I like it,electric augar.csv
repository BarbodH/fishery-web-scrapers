831005,ch312,2014-01-17 04:04:00,1590,"My 8in Fin-Bore III cuts through the ice like butter, no need to stop and clear anything no matter how thick the ice.  The entire point of the auger is to clear all that cut ice up and away from the blades.  Removing debris from the hole as you drill deeper puts less strain on whatever (electric drill, gas engine, person) is drilling the hole whether it's ice, dirt, concrete, thick wood, etc. There is no need in most cases, but it makes it easier on you and whatever tool you're using."

829990,crappieperchhunter,2014-01-12 04:08:00,2582,I'm still waiting for the day where an electric drill on a hand auger really makes any sense and saves any time or energy. Cause when that day comes I will be 1st in line to buy one.  Edit to add. Not meaning to Hijack your post Brian. It looks like you did an awesome job on the adaptor. I always enjoy posts where someone shows some of there McGyverism. My frustration with the electric drill option is based solely with the limited number of holes you can drill before your battery is dead. Some days running and gunning for perch/crappie I cut lots of holes and one battery would not last the full day and I don't want the extra weight of taking 2 batteries as I am a walker. If the batteries get to the point where they would last a full day....I'll be a very happy camper.

830057,ch312,2014-01-12 21:18:00,1590,"Two days ago my friend fried his new (34 day old) 20v dewalt drill with the 6"" auger. Just barely past the warranty from the depot.  The drill was used just a couple times and was new, started smoking after a few holes and stopped working. There was no need to push on the drill and there was no misuse. I own tons of dewalt tools in 12v, 18v and 20v. And i have never had problems with them, which is why i buy them. However i have not used them in -20C temps to drill holes in ice before. Clearly that is not what are intended for.  Your buddy was likely drilling straight through the ice without lifting it a few times to clear the ice and slush which puts a heck of a lot more strain on whatever motor and gears are turning the auger, even gas units.  There has been a few times where I was in a pinch and used 18 volt drills with a mixing paddle to mix 5 gallon buckets of concrete, grout, or thinset without burning up the motors and they sure aren't meant to be used for mixing such materials. Cold has no effect on anything in the drill except for the batteries and the cold air would help keep the motor cooler.   If you're going to buy a cordless for this purpose, I say go with Ridgid for their lifetime warranty."

I was surprised to hear the drill worked so well because, when I use my auger, I need to put quite a bit of torque on it---sometimes baking up (CCW) and going again. I don't remember exactly what I do, but I think  I lift it up when the going gets too hard. I guess  n when using a drill. ."

Haven't needed one either because ice around here has been very rare the past few years or longer.  I was concerned with the torque if the auger got hung up. Even a 18 volt can give you a jolt drilling through doug fir with a 1"" bit.  Keep the drill and batteries warm and you should be good for the day.  I'll take 2. If they work I'll take 100. If the price is right. Then I'll take 1000. See you on Dragon's Den. A local guy hit it big with a gizmo that attached to a cordless to roll up the straps on big rig trailers. He got the investment from one of the Dragon's."

I just started using my drill this winter and love it but am a little concerned about loosing the auger down a hole. Thought about the rope idea but how would you stop it from catching on the auger and winding the rope around the auger. A slip ring might work but you'd have to make sure the rope didn't catch on the wing nut, that plate is by far the best idea! Pattent it!  BTW, 8"" hole vs 6"" hole = a big differance in the number of holes you can drill on one charge. You will only get about 1/3 as many 8"" holes through the same thickness of ice as you will 6"" holes."

This is the cats   .  Ya I know I could buy an adapter for the drill,but I want something I know will last.  Took me a half hour to machine it out,used my last 15 minute break to weld it together and paint.  Grabbed the drill from work for the test run and headed to the ice after work.  Finbor 3 cuts like a hot knife through budda by hand,but he weight alone from the drill is enough to make it cut with ease. Boy theres lots of ice out at Minets now.  One thing I will add. I,ll be buying a new cordless,but it will have the key locking chuck. The hand tight ones are not for this.  The plate you see is for if for any reason the auger were to seperate from the drill,it wont go through the hole. Seen that on youtube.
