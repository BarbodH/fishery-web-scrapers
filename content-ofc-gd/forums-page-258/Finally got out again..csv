While it wasn't a whole lot warmer (-35C windchill) I am feeling better. Hit my favorite pike lake today for a little fishing. Got a late start as it took me longer to get my gear set than I would have liked and when I got to the lake the snow was 18"" or better deep. Got my holes drilled and set a big dead bait outside the shack and jigged inside. Managed to land close to 20 with a couple of decent ones and one big girl in the 40""- 41"" range. Took quite a while to revive her due to the cold and I am still feeling the effects of frost bitten fingers from the release. Supposed to be -45 - -50 windchills over night so I will be hunkering down again. Gonna be warm and toasty on Monday @ -16 of course.  "

832703,davey buoy,2014-01-26 11:08:00,5505,Good fish Dave!!!!Those temps are nasty though.  .
832704,Roy,2014-01-26 11:25:00,13728,"A beauty for sure, Dave! You're thinning out and here I thought you were sposed to heavy up for the winter. Now I'm gunna get spat upon for this and I know that we should all do our best to safely release our fish but I really don't think that in those temps you should be taking a chance on losing your fingers. Maybe I'm just getting old....can't take extreme cold or heat as well as I once could.   A great fish though Dave, and I enjoy all of your reports.,"
