Lots of chasers,but no takers this morning.     It was so cold and windy,I went through 2 green bottles today. Next year,I get the thermo hub. "
832738,tb4me,2014-01-26 17:43:00,3295,Hey that looks cool. Those huts look light and easy to blow away thou. Do they have floors in them?
832741,davey buoy,2014-01-26 17:49:00,5505,I saw them out there as well.They are kinda cool looking
832745,NAW,2014-01-26 17:57:00,4022,It was cold and heck out on the main lake today.  Wind was just cutting through me.  Teach me for not layering up properly....
832750,irishfield,2014-01-26 18:10:00,26272,You would think they'd have gone with any colour but White! Both for visibility safety and free warmth from the sun with a colour.
832752,kickingfrog,2014-01-26 18:18:00,8333,"Understand what you're saying Irish, I guess the flip-side is the light that the white ones would let in."
832762,misfish,2014-01-26 18:46:00,29133,"The teepee is a basic set up. The guy used what look like 12ft 4x4 for the set up. Wood stove in the middle and no floors. Just holes and buckets to sit on. Opening had a flap over it. If it was an east wind,well,the wind would be coming in. I didnt noticed how he had the teepee anchored I did ask what he was charging. 140 dollars for 4 hours.  Seems to be ok with others,as he was at 2/3rds full."
832765,kickingfrog,2014-01-26 18:53:00,8333,"Wow. I wouldn't pay that, but I don't set the market."

Thats insane money..Especially once the ice gets slushy The only times I rent huts is when I want to get up out of the slop.To each their own  suppose.."

832775,Steve,2014-01-26 19:19:00,2075,"does a hut operator have to pay taxes (property taxes)?  ie, can i set up 15 huts, rent them to my hearts content, then at the end of the season, take my money and run (without paying taxes)?"

You first have to have insurance.(that I know for sure) Im not sure if this guy does or not. He was running it out of his pu truck   I also did not see any numbers on the teepee,s. If my memory serves me right,Cannings had numbers on all his rental huts.  I guess when the MNR make their way by,he will find out."
832791,Joey,2014-01-26 20:37:00,9122,"Different for sure B.  We had alot of chaser too today, but no takers.  Picky little..........."
832792,Tim Mills,2014-01-26 20:48:00,476,Feel the same way here in Mississauga sometimes.

832807,porkpie,2014-01-26 22:48:00,2521,"Your not alone.  If I'm renting a hut, it better have a wood floor, and walls and a serious heater/cook stove!"
