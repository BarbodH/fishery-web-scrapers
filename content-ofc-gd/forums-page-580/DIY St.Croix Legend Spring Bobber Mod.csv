547605,BFSC Kevin,2011-02-04 05:06:00,1351,"Haha! Good job Will! Looks pretty good.  but the spring should be more parallel with the rod, it should bend down to that position when you got the lure/line through"
547606,BFSC Kevin,2011-02-04 05:07:00,1351,just bend a bit to make it parallel    (2) position is the best angle for bite detection/sensitivity
547607,thebigcatch,2011-02-04 05:17:00,138,Not bad !
547609,highdrifter,2011-02-04 06:16:00,2534,Nice!
547630,2advanced,2011-02-04 13:07:00,53,Where did you pick up the spring for 10$?
547664,frozen-fire,2011-02-04 14:32:00,542,LOL Will...I guess you couldn't resist after Kevin and myself using them that day.
