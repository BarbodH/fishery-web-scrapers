547415,mike rousseau,2011-02-03 20:40:00,4661,Anybody out there with an iPhone... You need to get this app!  Fish calendar  It uses the sun and moon phases in a formula or something and it shows you all the times if day for bite windows... It also gas a general estimated efficiency for the day... I've been testing this app since about October and it is incredible how accurate it is...  Keep in mind this is a guidline... Local weather can still trump a full moon or a sunset... But I highly decibels this app... I think it's 5 bucks... It's worth it guys...  And if you pair this app with the navionics app you'll be unstoppable...$15
547425,cityfisher,2011-02-03 21:37:00,959,Ill look into it !  The navionics map is awesome for the iphone.... no need for a seperate GPS and a 150 map for it !
547429,mike rousseau,2011-02-03 21:48:00,4661,Trust me ... I'm a serious angler... And I tested this app for several months over wich I landed 20 or so walleye over 25 inches... At the end of each day I compared my fish catch times to the app... Perfect match!
547430,tb4me,2011-02-03 21:49:00,3295,doe anyone know if these are avaiable for the blackberry or window phones?

547432,jedimaster,2011-02-03 21:51:00,3472,Keep in mind that the function of the Iphone GPS doesn't work unless you have a cell phone signal...
547434,mike rousseau,2011-02-03 22:10:00,4661,True...
547436,irishfield,2011-02-03 22:13:00,26272,I just print them out here http://www.solunarforecast.com/solunarcalendar.aspx for the month and throw it in the boat/tackle box/hut.  DANG.. well I use to.. it won't let you print anymore!!
547447,Terry,2011-02-03 22:48:00,14456, what zip code do you use
547452,irishfield,2011-02-03 22:57:00,26272,Home.. or the lake.. needs a space. L9M 2C1
547730,Homer Is King,2011-02-04 17:00:00,305,"That is a great app.  I'm a strong beliver in moon / sun cycles.  This app will even let you store info about each catch such as weather, temp, pressure, bait / lure, GPS co-ords and a pic.  Here are a couple more fishing related apps that I like  Boat Ramps Cost: $0.99 It lets you search for boat ramps and marinas by current location, Zip code, or city. It will even let you add boat ramps to the data base. It has a limited amount of boat ramps but it will get you started in a new location.  Flick Fishing Cost: $0.99 This is a cool little fishing game. It has several different fishing locations, species, tournaments, etc. A good time killer.  Proknot Cost: $1.99 It has detailed step-by-step instructions on a wide range of fishing and rope knots. WFN Fishing Log Cost: $2.99 This is a good log. It lets you track alot of info including weather, pics, bait and tackle. The 2 shortcomings are that it doesn't support GPS and I can't figure out how to switch units from imperial to metric.  If you have the fishing calendar this app is redundant."
