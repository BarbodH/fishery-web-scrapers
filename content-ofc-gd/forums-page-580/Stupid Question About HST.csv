I know if I buy a used boat from the US, that customs will collect the taxes on the boat and trailer when you cross the border. Then the remaining taxes on the trailer are collected when you register the trailer with the Ministry of Transportation. But, if I buy a used boat from a someone in Canada do I pay HST on the price of the boat. If so, when do you pay the HST and where do they collect it and is there any way around paying the taxes.  I figure there is an obvious answer, but just don't know it. Thanks."
