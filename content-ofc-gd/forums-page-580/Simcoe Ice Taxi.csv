He used to fish it years ago, through the ice, but, hasn't been up there for a long time. The two of us are going on foot with the hut and gear, but, I was wondering if anyone offers a taxi service out on the ice?  Thanks, Frank"

I know theres a bunch in gilford and a bunch at killarney beach. best bet is to give them a call and see.
