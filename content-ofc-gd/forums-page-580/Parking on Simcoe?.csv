545132,jedimaster,2011-01-29 18:31:00,3472,Anyone know if there is any free parking and place not to far of a walk out for some perch fishing?
545214,hawkeye,2011-01-29 21:20:00,162,There's limited (very) parking along Lake Drive South and some have been parking on the ice at the foot of Glenwoods.
545222,Grimace,2011-01-29 21:33:00,2020,Jackson Point.  Park down by Bonnie Boats.  Newfie bait shop opens at 6 or 630 (nice folks).  Gazillion minnows for 5 bucks.  Whitefish skunked me out there yesterday.
545224,Grimace,2011-01-29 21:35:00,2020,I should of mentioned that it is just another 10 minute drive or so.
547418,jedimaster,2011-02-03 21:09:00,3472,"Funny, I have moved to Keswick almost a year now and I have no idea where anything is. Where is Bonnie Boats and is it a fairly short walk to decent perching?"
547423,Terry,2011-02-03 21:25:00,14456,"Bonnie Boats is Jacksons Point  at Glenwoods you have lake access, most times lot park on the ice there and on one side of Glenwoods Beach road"
