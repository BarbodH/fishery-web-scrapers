Service: EXCELLENT - People there are VERY friendly, especially ""MOM"" (I forgot what her name was? hahaha - but people told me to call her Mom!)  Guides: Terry was who took me out. Funny Dude!  Give him a few beers, he'll treat ya well! LOL!  Overall Rating: 10/10 Reason: Just had a great experience overall - VERY relaxing and no troubles with anything while I was there!  PS: BRING A CAMERA!  Lots of Photo-Opportunities around!"
