546212,bigmac1984,2011-02-01 03:43:00,193,I am curious to know if anyone uses these and do they actually work and not leak?  http://www.berkley-fishing.com/products/tools-equipment/classics/bait-management-center-6-container  Thanks

546217,solopaddler,2011-02-01 04:03:00,8605,I wish they'd just sell the stuff in non leaking containers.  I transfer all my Gulp to a suitable sized rubbermaid container with a screw on lid. They come in all sizes and they're cheap.

546363,scugpg,2011-02-01 17:48:00,1373,"You should be able to pickup the plastic ""pee sample containers"" with the yellow lid at a craft shop etc. Tight seal and inexpensive to buy. I used them for Jensen eggs as well as their container tends to leak."
546383,bassjnkie,2011-02-01 18:26:00,1101,"I use the same containers Solo mentioned, much cheaper, durable and never leaks."
546385,s2k4mee,2011-02-01 18:29:00,73,I've been using the Plano liquid bait locker and have been quite please with it.
546409,CRAPPIE,2011-02-01 19:51:00,213,"To be honest, one word to say ""LEAK"" no matter what container(I have the container from Berkly but still leak"" you use. I give up to use the juicy one but I am still one of Berkley loyal customer but I switch back to the dry lure."
546541,buckhorn250,2011-02-01 22:54:00,85,Picked up the Gulp management system last year...it leaks!...but still alot better then the original containers.
546555,SlowPoke,2011-02-01 23:05:00,2984,"I like this thing; used it over a year and still no leaks. It has a double seal and you have to press very hard to close it. If you don't and only get to the first seal, it will leak a little bit. Best of all the shape conforms to my tackle bags/totes. No more messing with bottles and jars."
546565,SRT8 smoker craft,2011-02-01 23:19:00,1107,"I have never had a gulp container leak once out of 6-8 I have bought I always leave the foam seal on it that is glued to the container only open it half way and it won't leak. I have given up on the tubs the packages are way softer and it seems to me that there's A LOT of old tubs kicking around with hard unuseable baits in them it's a bit pricey to buy the bags but I like the feel of the baits better. I also only use the 3-4"" minnows for drop shotting ."
547397,rbaquial,2011-02-03 19:47:00,968,"Never used it. Why bother, when there are cheaper methods that can resolve this?  When I but the smaller containers (2"" Minnow) from Gulp!Alive, I just go visit my local Walk-In Clinic and take a few piss sample jars!  Hahaha... Not filled of course!"
547815,PikeMolester,2011-02-04 20:27:00,428,I use lidlock from Canadian Tire and they are like 4 bucks. Not paying 20 bucks for Berkleys. THese work perfectly.
