You've got to earn your fish right now with knee deep drifts everywhere and slush pockets over our boots in some spots, but we made it.  Almost 2 kilometers and 17 panting, please find me an inhaler air breaks later, we set up shop in 78 fow.  Marked fish immediately, but they didnt bite for about 30 mins.  Then, they turned on. We were fishing by 9am, off the water by 2:30pm and we landed 16 whiteys and 2 lakers.  Lost about the same number within the first few feet of the fight, tiny mouths on those things haha. I also caught the fattest little laker I've ever seen.  I said when I got it, I'll bet theres 20 smelt in that thing... final tally? 16 smelt, 1 goby Stopped filming most of them, but I do have some clips I added and some pics as well.  Enjoy!       http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ETXCF6wO70"
