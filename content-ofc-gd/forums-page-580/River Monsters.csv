547261,danc,2011-02-03 04:17:00,4677,Great memories!!
547510,spinnerdoc,2011-02-04 01:53:00,556,"i think so too, but a fair question don't you think?"
547596,BillM,2011-02-04 04:26:00,17367," Sure it's a fair question, but come on man you actually thought I'd say ALL people fishing Erindale are flossers?  That's a bit of a stretch!!!"
547597,spinnerdoc,2011-02-04 04:33:00,556,Maybe it was.Now we know what you meant.
547604,DRIFTER_016,2011-02-04 05:02:00,10439,"  Nope, just 98.435% and only during the month of September!!!"
546737,kemper,2011-02-02 03:37:00,2232,"Did anyone else just watch as the guide on Discovery's River Monsters explained how to line spawning sockeye...?  ""Lead shot two feet from the hook - trying to get the line into their open mouths...""  Interesting  Kemper"
546738,irishfield,2011-02-02 03:42:00,26272,Yep.. and legal where they're doing it. We had that arguement around here about 3 weeks ago..
546740,fishcrisp,2011-02-02 03:42:00,17,:jerry:
546742,kemper,2011-02-02 03:44:00,2232, I wasn't sure about the legality...and I'm not surprised to hear that it is in fact legal but I am surprised that they would explicitly explain that is how they were doing it.
546760,DRIFTER_016,2011-02-02 04:10:00,10439,"Yep, that's the way they fish them. Sockeye are plankton feeders and don't hit baits. They can be caught on beads though, but only when they are long past their prime in the rivers. The other 4 pacific salmon however are willing biters."
546767,kemper,2011-02-02 04:28:00,2232, I didn't know that about Sockeye - maybe something that they should have explained while they were explaining the technique
546819,Richard S.,2011-02-02 13:16:00,75,"My wife had to pick my jaw up off the ground after seeing that. What was funny was seeing him demonstrate how lining works.......  What he should have done was explain that the ""technique"" they were using is legal where they were fishing.   Rich."
546870,Rich,2011-02-02 14:59:00,3927,Not sure why he'd have to explain it's legality.. in other countries it's illegal to release fish. here it's common practice. I'm glad every fishing show that C&R's doesn't sit there explaining it's legality everytime a fish goes back. haha
546886,ADB,2011-02-02 15:17:00,444,"I've watched quite a few episodes, and from what I can see, Jeremy Wade is a pretty ethical angler.  He always holds the fish horizontally, and usually keeps it in the water while he talks to the camera, unlike most fishing shows on WFN.  I've only ever seen him keep 1 fish, and that was because it couldn't be revived.  So, I wouldn't hold this one against him."
546896,John,2011-02-02 15:33:00,2956,Haven't we bashed this to death ad nauseum?
546914,bigugli,2011-02-02 16:01:00,6138,But where would we be without armchair critics?
546925,BillM,2011-02-02 16:29:00,17367,"Go down to Erindale park in Sept, the pro's down there will teach you all you need to know!"
547029,kemper,2011-02-02 19:53:00,2232,"Wasn't looking to open the lining can (bucket?) of worms - glad it stayed civil. Nothing against the host either, he does run an entertaining show and from what I can see treats the fish properly."
547062,Dutchy,2011-02-02 21:17:00,416,What was funny was the bear taking the fish
547068,perchslayer666,2011-02-02 21:31:00,280,"Have any of yous seen how they ""catch"" Paddlefish????? You'll probably have to wear your diapers for that one."
547080,irishfield,2011-02-02 22:15:00,26272,"Or ""Dumb fish"" in Alaska... I'll have to find that video..

547104,fishing n autograph,2011-02-02 23:11:00,2540,No more disturbing the the alligator harvesting on Swamp People
547126,aplumma,2011-02-03 00:21:00,6896,Well kind of the same the alligators are by the tag so their is a limit of how many are harvested. Very few of the gators are snagged most are baited. Snagging was done by few and only to kill time till they checked the lines.   Art
547221,spinnerdoc,2011-02-03 03:10:00,556,I hope you are not implying that all of the guys fishing there are flossers.
547239,Pigeontroller,2011-02-03 03:40:00,2793,"I saw it tonight, definately was a bit surprised at the lining...I've watched a half a dozen shows now and I am very impressed with Jeremy Wade's fish handling and the ethics he displays."
547243,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2011-02-03 03:47:00,0, I think he's just saying there's lots of flossers down there.
547250,danc,2011-02-03 03:57:00,4677, Kinda reminds me of you catching Pike on Nipigon Wayne.
547253,irishfield,2011-02-03 04:04:00,26272,LOL.. Specks one day along that shore.. Pike the next with the wind in the opposite direction!
547254,danc,2011-02-03 04:06:00,4677," So you got it all figured out now, huh Bud? Been fishing there 20 years or more and I still don't have it figured out. LOL"
