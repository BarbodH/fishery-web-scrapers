We talked fishing, played around with my HDS5 trying to figure out how to do some fine tuning that I wanted to do, went over some maps and arial views, and had a nice fish fry.  This is one of those young men that anyone would be proud to introduce as their son! You done a good job pikeslayer!  One of the nicest evenings I can remember in a very long time! We are already looking forward to seeing him again soon!"
