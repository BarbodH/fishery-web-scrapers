546821,mr blizzard,2011-02-02 13:24:00,1589,My son and I wre scanning some other sites regarding fishing.  This is why we are so proud to be a member of this board. It is like night and day.

546986,Rattletrap2,2011-02-02 18:11:00,1652,"This site has always been the best for solid fishing info, but the sense of ""family"" that you get here is unmatched anywhere. I don't bother much with other fishing boards anymore, but for things like welding and such, I do go to other forums. They are radically different. You can get info, but the warm fuzzy feeling just isn't there.  This board has helped so many of us through tough times and we have celebrated good times! Nothing else quite like it that I have found! ""Fishing"" is just the common bond that brings us here."
