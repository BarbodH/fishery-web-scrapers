545530,jedimaster,2011-01-30 22:47:00,3472,"this stuff always comes up for tracker boats yet for some reason people still buy trackers... Honestly people would be so much better off with a used lund or used princecraft than a new tracker. Love my SV16 2000 doesn't leak a drop and is rock solid. Bets of luck dude, I hope you get your boat fixed.  Umm I didn't manage to go through every page but what every happened?"
545943,walleyemen,2011-01-31 17:59:00,316,"On a final note i sold the boat as it was, i was very honest with the buyer and the boats issues, he was happy i was sorta happy to be rid of a second boat payment but i lost my shirt i basically sold it for what was left owing on it, i have since talked with many other folks with similiar tracker marine problems, hopelyfully with lots of exsposer the message will get out how bad these boats really are!Had i had some better finicial means i would have fought this tooth and nail but it wasn't in the cards, the big corperate guy wins agains!"

545980,irishfield,2011-01-31 19:10:00,26272,I hope they do TEE.. but why is an insurance company covering manufacturing defects?  That said... I wonder how many guys with Trackers have considered asking the Barrie police to trailer their boats home for them... if you know what I mean!
545981,Grimace,2011-01-31 19:11:00,2020," Sorry to hear that Wayne.  At least you can be glad that it is over, not that it is any consolation to losing your shirt on the boat.  This whole thing is disgraceful.  Just disgraceful."
545986,Roy,2011-01-31 19:17:00,13728, hahahahaha Epic transom damage right there eh?  I've never owned a Tracker but never thought they were that bad. Every company has a less stellar product from time to time. The difference is what kind of after sales service you will get. Sorry you guys didn't do so well with your purchases.
547365,tee,2011-02-03 17:34:00,5,Well....I just found out the ins. co. denied my claim on hitting something.....no physical damage to the hull at the crack! Looks like I'll be tearing mine apart again to fix it...this will be fun Friggin' Cracker Marine anyway.  TEE
547379,irishfield,2011-02-03 18:35:00,26272,"I hope all the other Tracker owners here are learning something...  ...when the hull cracks on you....just forget to strap it to the trailer and drop it somewhere HARD. Then call the insurance company. Yah.. you're probably gonna get charged under the Highway traffic act for an insecure load.. but that'll be a cheap price to pay. Better yet, drop it right in the parking lot at the ramp and the HTA won't apply..."

What do you think Tracker would do if a majority of OFC'ers went to the following web site and took their survey My link? - like I just did.

Through some postings on this website it has come to my attention that at least one Tracker boat customer has been unfailty treated, in my opinion. In the discussions around this particluar issue it appears that neither Tracker, nor the Marine who sold this individual a boat is accepting responsibilty for what is, from the information provided, a manufacturing defect and poor workmanship.  Further the cavalier and uncaring manner with which this individual has been dealt is concerning to me as a consumer: if it can happen to this person, it is fair to extrapolate that this is the manner of dealing with product defects. If you are interested in discovering the details, simply google OFC.com Tracker boats.  If we can get Drifter an award, i woudl think we can get Tracker's attention, no?"

Buddy bought a Crestliner welded hull 20 years ago, 16 foot open with a tiller 40, in 2 years it had developed multiple cracks in the material immediately adjacent to the welds. Welds themselves didn't crack but the material cracked lengthwise along the edge of the welds. He was a welder at one of the steel companies in Hamilton with tickets out the yingyang, too much heat if I recall is what he blamed."

545137,AverageJoeFishing,2011-01-29 18:51:00,70,"I'm a welder and have welded several of them... The problem is that they are not meant for big waters, if you go in big waves with them you can't bang them at all just coast the waves... I owned a tracker for 3 years without any leaking problems because I am not hard at on my boats I slow down in big waters.. Takes a little more time but alot less hard on yr boats. Now to fix your problem take the whole boat apart, get a good aluminum welder to mig weld the boat at more points than stock ( there are not welded enough thats their main problem ) It might warp a bit but it rather be a little bit warped than leaking right?? Then get a somebody who is good with a Tig to tig weld all the cracks from outside the boat ( yes u will see the welds but who cares its in the water ) If u want it to last this is what u gotta do... if u mig weld the cracks it wont last just mig weld the braces inside and install new or more braces as needed...

I let him go into details why welded was more efficient than riveted, and how Tracker offered one of the best warranties of any aluminum boat on the market. I had this thread clearly in my mind from reading the first couple of pages this morning.I could feel my ears getting warmer with each praise he spoke of his product and company. It came to a point where i could hear him talking, but nothing was registering in my brain.All i could think of was all the crap that you and others have gone through, and how he was Bull ing me with his speach. I finally took him aside, wife looking at me like a deer in headlites at this point, and began. I told him that i always do alot of research,before making such an expensive and hopefully lifetime commitment to a product, and asked him to honestly explain to me all of the negative feedback that i had encountered on the internet from owners all over north america.I love eye contact, and all this time i was looking him right in his baby blues.I told him that the biggest problems were cracking around welds, and poor finishing and nightmarish accounts of people trying to get help from customer service. I told him i had first hand knowledge of someone having these problems,and told him that i had just purchased a PrinceCraft product because of its riveted design. His jaw dropped, and he was having trouble finding words to say. All he said,was that i should move along. On parting, he touched my shoulder and said ""tell your friend to keep pushing, and stay in thier face until he gets compensation,and he will get compenstated"" He then turned and walked back into the booth and sat down. I left at this point.  so stay in thier faces until they get so fed up, they will take responisbilty."

477762,charbonez,2010-06-21 16:52:00,1," I know exactly how you feel Wayne. My tracker pro guide 16 SC has 52 hours on it and it has cracks all over just like yours. I drove 9 hours to bring the boat to the repair shop that they told me i HAD to use (grumpy's marine) in Newmarket. Now, 3 weeks later, they tell me that they don't use them as a warranty repair centre anymore so i have to drive back out there and bring the boat somewhere else. I explained to them that i traveled 9 hours to bring it to grumpy's and they said that there is nothing they can do. This company is unbelievable, I have no clue how they are still selling boats."
477778,BillsTheBassMan,2010-06-21 17:19:00,932," You don't need a lawyer.  Take them to Small Claims Court (the limit is 25K now - not 10K like it used to be).  It will cost you $75 to file the claim and you'll have a few other expenses along the way.  Small Claims Court works quick and in my history it works well!  You have a serious case here as you've been seriously screwed and the ignoramuses at Tracker are just delaying and delaying and keeping their wallets tucked away.  Here's a general outline of what a SCC case would entail:  1)  You file a claim - $75 2)  You serve tracker with the claim 3)  They have 20 clear calendar days to file a defense, if they don't, you file for default judgment and win on the spot.  In my history of taking people to SCC for unpaid accounts at work, everyone has paid and not filed a defense.  If you go to trial, you'll have settlement conferences and the whole shabang.  I can help you out with it if you choose to go that route.  It's a good route to go and they'll probably call offering to fix your boat as soon as the claim lands on their desk.  They won't want to invest that kind of time.  THE IDEA OF THE BOAT AND THE LEMONS WAS SWEET TOO!  Best of Luck (and remember, I can help you, free of charge, with the SCC process if you feel inclined to go that route).  Ryan"

Spoke with my insurance company on monday, they are going to try put it threw but at not sure how i will make out, as it was not hit or impacted, looks like i'm screwed again, but we'll see, as far as i am concerned, hard loading as they say it would come under impact, but we'll see, here are some pics from today of the boat and the cracks, if you look at the first pics i posted you'll see the damage as it was before tracker got it, these pics showw where they scratched the hull and banged the cracks inward, also notice the angles of pics i took of the hull to prove of no impacts by me to the boat, the hull is straight and dent free.            "
478159,fisher,2010-06-22 15:33:00,451,"If it were me (but then again I take things way overboard sometimes to prove a point when I feel like I have been wronged), I would spray paint the side of the boat with neon paint saying ""Buying a Tracker? Hear my story.""  (using removable paint of course) and park it outside bass pro while handing out flyers with your story on it.  I would also spend a few dollars and create a web page with your story on it and paint your web address on the boat.  As far as I know, there is nothing illegal/malicious in doing this.  You are merely trying to share your story with the world.  No need to bad mouth Tracker - just tell it like it is.  Heck, I would even drive the boat right down to the heart of Toronto during the G20 this weekend and try to get world wide coverage.  No doubt some media down here will pick up your boat story just to show that the G20 covers a wide range of issues and protests.  Call every news media to tell them what you are doing - I guarantee some will show up - especially if you tell them you want to bring it down to the G20.  And make sure one of the news media you call is A-Channel news - these stories are right up their alley since their market encompasses a lot of boaters and copy Tracker Boats with your planned date of protest.  If they are smart, Tracker will take care of your problem before you move forward with your plan."
478161,walleyemen,2010-06-22 15:50:00,316,"Before i do anything i'm going to let the insurance access the boat, they assured me they have the experts to check it over and then at least i have a documented accessment of the damages,and of course this means traveling to toronto and the risk of getting arrested and not to mention the exspense,I've e-mailed several news media places, as of yet no responses, been weeks, i'm getting all my ducks in place, ,All i can do is wait! Time costs nothing!I was thinking of putting a poster on it when i picked it up but thought better of it!"
478163,Grimace,2010-06-22 15:55:00,2020,That is horrible Wayne.  Sorry to hear they did not come clean.  That is just brutal.
478164,bigfish1965,2010-06-22 16:00:00,3382,"It seems odd that the dealer doesn't mind the manufacturer calling them liars. That pretty much would end any relationship I would have with a boat maker. I understand every maker is going to put out a clunker from time to time, but it is how you handle your mistakes. not your successes, that shows your credibility. It would seem at face value, Tracker has none."
478192,JohnF,2010-06-22 16:36:00,3494,"Here's a thought. I've been following this thread and think I have a sense of the timelines. I wonder if it was made clear enough to Tracker that this damage was clearly done before you received the ""new demo"" boat from them. It seems obvious to me that someone did some repairs, evidently before you took delivery, and whoever was responsible for selling you the boat (Tracker or a dealer) owes you an explanation and service, not just buck passing.  As long as you're convinced that the timelines have been made abundantly clear to Tracker and the dealer involved then I think you should give them fair warning that you're taking this to the next step. That next step could be litigation, small claims court, or trying to involve either a national tv/newspaper (Dale Goldhawk style) or the Consumer Protection people. Heaven knows there's enough legislation out there designed to protect the consumer against unethical business practices. Frankly I think the tv/newspaper route is a great alternative. I wouldn't think Tracker or their dealers would be too happy about having the story on tv or in the Star with the Tracker name splashed all over it. It becomes a relatively cheap problem to solve compared to a load of bad publicity in a highly visible medium.  All the best with it. JF"
478205,POLLIWOGG,2010-06-22 17:03:00,835,"Another option would be to get a copy of the construction standards for boats for the time it was built and see if they cheaped out somewhere. If you can show it doesn't meet the standards and you can collect some support from others with the same problem then petition for a recall on all of them. If it doesn't meet construction standards it doesn't matter if it was ""hard trailed"" or not."
478206,John,2010-06-22 17:07:00,2956," I'm with JF here. The most expeditious route IMHO is the media, TV, Newspaper, maybe even Outdoor/Fishing Mags. You still have the legal route if all else fails. Sounds like you have pretty darn good documentation of the facts."
478208,JohnF,2010-06-22 17:12:00,3494, It might be tough to get industry specific mags to jump on this as they probably have substantial revenues from the Tracker name. OTOH I don't recall seeing Tracker spending big bux in Ontario news media. That makes it a perfect target of opportunity for them.  JF
478209,irishfield,2010-06-22 17:13:00,26272,Wayne.. you know very well they are not trailering cracks..  none of them even line up with a bunk boards!!  Was so nice of them to take a hammer and smash in the damaged area some more...
478210,bigfish1965,2010-06-22 17:13:00,3382,"So if you go on rough roads, or rough waters or if you ever powerload, the Trackers will fall apart? And thats okay with them? A boat should be designed for the LIKELY uses it will receive. A fishing boat will be trailered on crappy roads, it will take nasty waves, it will rub docks, knock the occasional rock and be power loaded...none of those things are outside the reasonable use of a fishing craft. Its not a tea pot...its a boat..made of metal. All the boats I have had endured all that and more and never leaked....but then again, mine were all riveted hulls. I still see 40 yr old Springboks out there with more war wounds than a Navy ship."
478226,walleyemen,2010-06-22 18:01:00,316,"Wayne my insurance guy said the same thing LOL, I'm going to for now leave it up to the adjuster and boat damage investigator, i was told i will receive any and all findings from his/her reports. The insurances findings should be all i need to take this to the next step,i really hate to put it threw insurance, and believe me i have told them nothing but the truth, tracker says it's hard loading that caused the damage, then the insurance has the option of proving them wrong, as well as telling me if in fact it has bondo in it,then i'll procede from there. It really is a shame, i did very much like the boat."
478246,craigdritchie,2010-06-22 19:06:00,1586,"I wouldn't hold out a lot of hope for media coverage. TV stations and newspapers get bombarded with stories like this - and much worse - pretty much every week. Like it or not, boats are considered luxury items and there isn't a whole lot of sympathy for problems with so-called luxury goods, especially when some people out there can't even buy food.  Fishing magazines aren't likely to print this kind of story either because (1) they don't want to alienate Tracker as an advertiser or prospective advertiser, and (2) it's just not the kind of content readers are willing to pay for. I won't even go into the potential legal ramifications.  Sorry to be a wet blanket, but after 25 years in the publishing business I have to tell you that's reality.  If neither the dealer nor Tracker corporately are willing to fix your boat, your only real option is to either call the insurance company or pursue it through the courts. Good luck."
478280,BillsTheBassMan,2010-06-22 19:57:00,932,The lemons thing in front of BPS with your boat out front is your best publicity I guess.  It will let you tell your story a few times and start getting reactions from the store too.
478294,Syn,2010-06-22 20:17:00,519," Well...except BPS will just call Vaughn mall security and they would tell him to get off their private property and possibly bar him for 6 months-1 year+. Online media could reach many more people.

478326,JohnF,2010-06-22 21:24:00,3494,This has my attention now: The first step is to read this site thoroughly. http://www.settlement.org/sys/faqs_detail.asp?faq_id=4001257 You’ve got lots of material for this.  The Consumer Protection Branch takes this stuff seriously. Use them. There might be some help here: http://consumerinformation.ca/app/oca/ccig/main.do?language=eng  Then check this out.  Interesting reading about Tracker Marine.  Is this the company you’re dealing with? http://www.bbb.org/southwestern-missouri/business-reviews/boat-builders/tracker-marine-group-in-springfield-mo-10611 Some interesting stories there.  Sure looks to me that with the story you've got to tell there's gotta be someone there who'll listen.  But failing that I wouldn't give up totally on the media. They just need a story with people appeal. And people love stories in which the little guy gets justice from the big bully corps.  I'm gonna check out some possible sympathetic ears in the media.  This is kinda interesting. Obviously I can't promise anything but it can't hurt to make a little noise. Someone with a concern for what's best for the boat company may get wind of it and decide to stop the bleeding.  JF

Every company makes a bad product once in a while - it's life. the difference between a good company and a bad company is the one that stands behind their product.  The problem these days is companies don't focus on the right things - they focus on today's bottom line not product quality. They forget that quality will produce a strong bottom line. Today they are here - tomorrow, although it may be along time coming, those companies that fail to recognise the power of customer satisfaction will not be here. Don't stop till you get what you deserve Wayne. I had a similar fight with my new home builder. I peed off a lot of people getting what the Tarion program said I was entitled to - but now I have what I paid for and my neighbours who were too shy to stand up for their rights - well they don't - and never will."

464780,cisco,2010-05-10 04:57:00,597,"Such large are4as to repair would be crazy re rivet patching. Epoxy resin properly mixed for over three minutes with a kevlar composite fabric top and bottom will stop leaks forever. I did it on an 18ft crestliner that had cracks due to flex from age. Boat doesn't flex at all when hitting the small waves nor does the area leak at all. Been 4 years and zero signs of problems. Fix it and keep or sell it. But selling a Tracker/Cracker is easier when you show the kevlar you used to make the hull bulletproof. Selling a Tracker with a whole buncha rivet patches or selling it as a leaker isn't a very good move financially IMO. Cost is maybe $400. for the kevlar and epoxy resin. But then you have a strong boat again. Come check mine out if you want. The hull is way stronger than any new boat. In fact, maufacturers should offer an epoxy/kevlar option to add as an extra thing for $$$ and I bet many smart folks would go for it for their new tinny."
464803,F7Firecat,2010-05-10 12:01:00,347,"cisco  agreed  prep that hull properly (sandblast it), apply the right primer (flexible primer), fiberglass it and it will be bullet proof  really sux you have to do it, id be parked outside wherever I bought it the boat, a few nice signs every weekend and evening until the manufacturer made it right"
464829,walleyemen,2010-05-10 13:01:00,316,"It would be a option if i lived closer, If they do not repair the said damage ,I will be going to the canadian coast guard safety standards to have the boat accessed, and if need be right it off threw insurance, if they refuse to replace or repair it, who knows still playing the waiting game!"
464864,bigbuck,2010-05-10 14:48:00,2449,"Go to the Coast Guard. Don't listen to the dealer that they will 'get to the bottom of this'. They don't want the headache of dealing with the coast guard. Go after them and go hard. The economy in the U.S. is for the dumps. If this is how American built products are put together, I'll take my chances with a cheap Chinese built boat, that way, I know what I am getting, junk (pardon the pun). They should fess up and fix or replace the boat. Keep after them and contact a lawyer and let them know that."
465016,wkrp,2010-05-10 23:11:00,656,Sorry gents but i can no longer stay out of this debate. I have been working in the aviation industry with a major canadian airline for 30 years in the structures end of it and I have to agree with Wayne. If welding aluminium was better and more  structurally sound the aviation industry certainly would have gone that direction. There is no way that an aircraft can hurl  through the air at 500 miles plus an hour   with a welded hull and structure.Welded aluminium boat hulls are no where near  as strong as riveted . And by the way I am one of those trained Monkeys that can rivet and wouldn`t have it any other way.
465068,irishfield,2010-05-11 01:06:00,26272,I was gonna do the stress calculations of a welded fillet vs a riveted attachment for them wkrp.. . but decided it was pointless!  Cisco's glass solution has merit.. for his situation... ie it worked for Chris and he's happy with it. All that matters.  In Wayne's Cracker case... his boat reinforcements are cracked off INSIDE the hull... causing the hull to crack beside said welds. Adding kevlar/glass overtop will not return the structual integrity to his boat. The inside bulkheads need to be repaired and tied back into the hull skin properly.. (with aluminum as required.. and RIVETS!)
465073,nofish4me,2010-05-11 01:15:00,404," Isn't all this, just simple metallurgy. Steel bends, aluminium breaks. Heating a metal causes it to get brittle. No?"
465170,cisco,2010-05-11 09:52:00,597,"Wayne, my hull has a very long portion without stringers which was why over the years the flexing caused cracks where the console attached to the hull. At that place which acted as a stringer the crack occurred. Now with virtually no flexing in the hull it seems the issue of not enough stringers is compensated for by the aramid laid down.  Fibreglass boats do not have stringers in many parts of their hull no doubt due to the strength and flexibility features of the aramid stuff. Sure they have stuff like wood layed over in places like for the motor mounts, but for sure the Tracker/Cracker in question isn't that huge a boat so using epoxy and kevlar has merits.  IMO this boat has way too many cracks and broken stringers going on. I'm saying that the cost-effective/financially feasible solution to get this angler back on the water is what I suggest. Properly applying the kevlar to both top and bottom would compensate for the broken stringers, but for sure also use it on the stringers to repair/reattach them. Maybe I wasn't specific enough.  By the way, my old boat wasn't sandblasted. Cleaned, sanded a bit, deoiled/wiped with the epoxy reducer. Composites are a different kinda thing than aluminum which is why jet fighters are made of it instead of aluminum.  For many small areas it would be faster and wayyy less expensive than using aluminum patches. Wayne you perhaps misunderstand what I advised. I said top and bottom application. And most certainly use the material to repair the stringers also.  I expect that boat owner Wayne has the resources to chase Tracker around to get justice and I hope you're successful. All I'm suggesting is a way for a guy to fix his own boat properly if he has to do it himself. Oh, and I forgot to mention that with my boat I applied carbon fibre, then kevlar on top of that. The carbon doesn't like to flex but the thicker kevlar does. Zero signs of delamination or failure of any kind so far. The properties of epoxy resin may be unfamiliar to many here, but I invite anyone to join me for a ride to see how the boat handles the small waves that are like driving over rocks.  Maybe give a cost estimate on an aluminum patch repair to so mush damage Wayne (plane Wayne) (sorry, have to differentiate between Wayne/boat owner and Wayne the plane expert). My guess is several thousand dollars and then other similar areas which haven't been similarly treated will likely erupt. Sure sounds like Tracker if anything will toss the hull.  That's why best repair is to lay strips down between each keel underneath, then after removing the wood floor lay repairs on the stringers then tie this together with strips laid between the stringers on the floor. Do the whole belly this way then paint.  My advice is simply to get a financially strapped angler back onto the water in a safe boat at a cost far less than an aluminum patch procedure. Sure, if you want also include some aluminum patches via rivet. Have to see the hull to determine how the repair would be done. But to assume aluminum patches or epoxy/aramid wouldn't work is kinda foolish with all the boats and airplanes around made of both."

As for the motor a 40hp Tracker Force, I had to replace the lower gears, because I hit the submerge rail embankment on Rice. And last fall the Starter bushings went and needed replacing.

464163,Roe Bag,2010-05-07 23:49:00,246,"When Crestliner first started manufacturing all welded hulls they experienced serious growing pains as well. It seems that the heat range of the welding equipment must be very accurate when dealing with aluminium. If not, the material in close proximity to the weld is damaged. It becomes brittle and less plyable and it will crack under stress."
464168,Gerritt,2010-05-08 00:06:00,6129,"I think I will just trust Wayne in this regard... as he is 100% correct! if we trust planes that are riveted, why should we not trust boats! not to mention the FACT that when aluminum is welded, it is not the weld itself that will fail... it is the area around the weld..  perhaps manufactures will someday just stick the basics...  I dunno and I am sure I am alone in this! Sure rivets may need to be rebucked.... certainly it beats a cracked Hull!!!  G."
464250,Billy Bob,2010-05-08 12:52:00,5865, Aren't the pontoons on the bush planes welded not to mention the pontoons on pontoon boats ?  ?  ?
464257,walleyemen,2010-05-08 13:12:00,316,"They may very well be, but are probally a very much higher guage of metal, making them less likely to flex around the welds.

464351,Radnine,2010-05-08 18:46:00,1538," Planes don't have to be water proof (they don't have to be air tight either). Aircraft floats use to have to be ""sloshed"" to be made water tight (I don't claim to be an expert on this, but I remember doing it for a guy once when I was a kid, it blew). Floats also don't spend all of their working life bashing through rough waters. For the most part they are either parked or in the air. I guess my point is that Gerritt's statement is a little misleading. Has every riveted boat been water tight out of the factory and stayed that way it's working life? Wayne got a crap boat and crap service. If the boats are as bad as everyone makes out (or as often) then people should boycott the product or the place that sells it. Jim"
464403,irishfield,2010-05-08 21:13:00,26272,"You might wanna rethink that through Jim !!  ""Not air tight""... try being pressurized so the passengers can breath and not pass out at 35,000 feet.  As for floats having to be sloshed to be water tight..... in my books that's right up there with the guys that coat their old leaking tinny with fiberglass or box liner crap! Do it right the first time... or go home.  I have 4 amphibs in the hangar right now... there will be 5 come Wednesday. Not one of them leaks a drop (and they can sit in the water for 5 months at a time) and there ain't no slosh in any of them, I can guarantee that as I built all 5 sets of floats!  ...oh and as Bunk and DanC can tell ya.. mine have landed is some ROUGH waters! Not that I wanna try that little Lake Nipigon in 4 footers ever again...but I did and survived to fish another day. (on float skins that are less than 1/2 the thickness of any aluminum boat an OFC'r owns!).. I also land and take off faster than any Aluminum boat here.. including mine.  Welding vs riveting is an argument that will live on and on and on here. Ask a supercub owner to look in the logs and see how many times in the aircrafts life that they've pulled the welded fuel tanks out to be fixed... because they crack beside the welds from wing flexing. My riveted wing tanks have not, nor do I expect them to ever, leak a drop. I know.. I just jinked myself...  As for Wayne getting a crap boat... like many others before him. I've had more than one Tracker in my shop for patches. Can't imagine the total number of them out there..."

Any way, you are right this argument will live on forever, and I am already sorry I was a part of it. It reminds me of how I had to have the baseball vs. Rounders argument in every pub I went to in England. The minute someone heard me order a beer it would be ""America eh? 'Ow bout that baseball then, girls play it over 'ere it's called rounders. And you have gloves right? In cricket it's bare 'anded........bla, bla, bla. I digress. All of your points are of course valid Wayne. But I still think that comparing an aircraft to a fishing boat, based only on the fact that both are riveted, is for the most part, bogus. I know first hand that welding aluminium is a bugger, where as you could train a chimp to pound a good rivet (no offence ) but I assume that some boat companies have it right and some do not. I guess as the owner of a fine welded boat, I get weird when generalizations start to rule the day (or the thread). Jim"
463770,walleyemen,2010-05-06 23:57:00,316,"By posting this statement i understand it may be removed or worse i may be banned from the site, i feel it's only fair to my fellow fishermen and women to advise them of how tracker marine deals with there customers and honor there lifetime warranty, , i purchased my boat from tracker marine in 05, it was a show room model used at ontario place as a demo, upon receiving the boat it had several paint and decal issues that took forever to have fixed but in fact were fixed, 1 year and 2 months after the carpet rotted out, so tracker only being the only manufacture to offer a 1 year warranty , screwed me there, no big deal i just replaced the carpet, last year the boat started to take on water, and not alittle ,alot!If it was left in over nite it would fill to the gunnels, took the boat in for a acessement, they tell be hard trailering, bull pucky!Never once has this boat been driven onto a trailer, what has happened is were the inside strakes are welded to the hull ,it has cracked around the welds and even in places started to tear the hull, cracks are pushed outwards, so if in fact i had hit somethingthe crack would be pushed in, there are in total 7 cracks in the hull and tonite the manager of tracker marine in Vaughn calls me and says his hands are tied and tracker marine says the boats been fixed before, , i've never touched this boat and the only time since new it was touched was by there guy when the first repairs were done, i am completely disgusted with this company, did some research and found this is a ongoing problem, i,m calling the head tracker complaint office in the morning and then i will be contacting the canadian coast guardds safety council to see if the can give me a fair assement and opinion of the damage. Buyer beware, any body owning a tracker all welded aluminium hull should be warned and if you have any questions on where to look for the damage ,give me a p.m, again i apoligize if this post affends anyone but i feel things like this should spoken out otherwise more and more will get the shaft! Thanks for listening Wayne proud owner of a CRACKER!!"
463773,irishfield,2010-05-07 00:02:00,26272,It's been a LONG battle Wayne and you have every reason to be pissed and to vent. I've seen the pictures.... and offered advise many months ago!  They only guarantee their welded HULL... but not the internal bracing that when being welded weakens the parent material OF THE HULL around said bracing. This to them is not considered welds on the hull. It's Bull and a class action suit should be brought together..
463775,Terry,2010-05-07 00:04:00,14456,I always feel people have the right to express their like of dislike of a product....  you got any photos
463776,Dutch,2010-05-07 00:05:00,831,"Sorry for your troubles, must be really frustrating.  It is no secret Tracker (and Nitro) don't have the best made boats, or the best customer service.  The boats are made to adhere to a price point, that's it, and they sell lots of them because of it.  Unfortunately, many people have to deal with poor quality and bad service after saving some bucks up front.  Great for those that don't get a lemon, bad for those that do."
463780,John Bacon,2010-05-07 00:16:00,3277,It always seems that when I hear about someone with a cracked hull that it is a Tracker boat.  I refer to them as Cracker boats.  I have seen others do the same.  I hope that you do some restitution.
463782,Daplumma,2010-05-07 00:22:00,1961,I looked at the welded Crackers but got a tip about the transoms having issues after being towed over rough roads.Went with a much better brand.Funny y'all came up with the same nickname for them.Bass Tracker=Ass cracker. Joe
463786,FISHINGNUT,2010-05-07 00:29:00,253,"My buddy has had nothing but problems with his tracker since the first day he put it in the water LEAKS, ELECTRICAL,and has even had to replace the MOTOR    .Ended up having to take it to an independent marina to get it fixed at his own expense just so he could get some use out it nothing but a run around from BPS where he bought it.He has owned the boat for four years and it has only been in the water maybe 8 times because its always in for repairs"
463788,misfish,2010-05-07 00:33:00,29133,This complaint has been made several times here.Like Wayne said.class action suit.  Sry to hear about your troubles.

463792,irishfield,2010-05-07 00:39:00,26272,Just looked back in my PM's and Wayne has been waiting for Trackers decission for over FOURTEEN MONTHS!
463796,bigugli,2010-05-07 00:44:00,6138,"Looks like some serious lack of hull integrity. Get a lawyer and keep hounding TC. IF this hull problem is widespread, TC needs to pull their approval and stop sales of this class of hull."
463798,walleyemen,2010-05-07 00:46:00,316,"LOL ya ! Good thing is folks i did go out and purchase a real boat, but am paying for 2, worse of it all is after 20 years i,ve been laid off for 5 weeks, not good timing!I just want this one fixed/replaced what ever so i can get out of it, dam my arse is sore."
463813,Gerritt,2010-05-07 01:25:00,6129,I would be posting this on every fishing forum in North America!.. this is pure bull..  your next stop should be Walleye Central.  G
463824,Grimace,2010-05-07 01:35:00,2020,"Over the weekend we had a couple of talks about this.  I feel for you Wayne.  You are a much classier man than I for waiting so long and giving them over a year.  They guarantee the welds, but as we know it is never the welds that crack, it is the metal around the welds that crack as the hard weld stays put and the aluminum around it flexes.  Much can be said about service, when my boat (different manufacturer) cracked, the man that sold me the boat went to the wall for me, jumped up and down, made demands, threatened to send all of their boats back and sell another brand.   They gave me a new hull, and threw a new galvanized trailer in to boot.  Wayne's sales guy is shrugging his shoulders and saying ""sorry sir, wish we could help, but head office blah blah blah blah""  Terrible.  I sure hope something positive comes out of this for you Wayne.  You do not deserve this, no one does."
463825,fish-miester,2010-05-07 01:36:00,864,all I can say is WOW.. that is NOT cool! my buddy just got a Tracker last year or the year before.. I will be sending him this Post!
463828,Grimace,2010-05-07 01:40:00,2020,On a side note.  My boat had 1 little tiny crack.  Wayne's boat is riddled with them.  Rough trailering my arse.
463853,walleyemen,2010-05-07 02:26:00,316,"And just for the record, i loved the boat, wide deep, road like a champ, i caught 1000's of fish out of it, honestly i'm not hating the boat just the construction and company itself! Wayne"
463873,lookinforwalleye,2010-05-07 03:12:00,4399,"Wow that`s quite a story and have read many more stories of cracking Tracker hulls and the lack of customer service,it`s amazing that Tracker can still find people to buy their product.  In my recent search for a boat Tracker was the first one scratched from the list."
463887,walleyemen,2010-05-07 03:51:00,316,You bought a stratos didn't you?Thats what i bought to replace mine.
463892,lookinforwalleye,2010-05-07 04:13:00,4399,"yep bought a Stratos, too busy to put it in the water maybe next weekend!  I hope you get some satisfaction in your battle with Tracker when I read stories like yours it makes me want to boycott Bass Pro all together.I wonder how some of the pro`s that are sponsored by Bass Pro feel about how they screw their customers???"
463899,fishnsled,2010-05-07 04:39:00,3520,Well that just sucks.  I too have a buddy that went through all the same crap.  Several trips to a local repair shop with no success.  Finally Tracker agreed to have the boat shipped back to them and they did the repairs just before the warrenty ran out.  Seems to be fine now but what a pain in the  to have to go through all that.  I hope your issue gets resolved to your satisfaction.
463905,mbac31,2010-05-07 09:10:00,904,You can PM me if you wish or call me. I'm about to go through a Lawyer about Tracker. Just getting all my ducks in line. My problem has been going on for 4 years now. They have changed 3 managers since. They are a very crafty group. Even drilled a hole in my block once. I wont say anything further. Here is my cell # b647-206-6278
463907,spincast,2010-05-07 09:35:00,3279,"Go park it outside Bass Pro on the weekends with big lemons all over it and red paint marks circling those metal deteriorations. Print out flyers with the history of your efforts to come to a fair and just settlement, and the shoddy service and support from both BPS and Tracker. Hand em out as people walk by. Boats are big bucks -- if this was a car such safety hazards would not be acceptable. Maybe invite a newspaper or two to come along. The Star has Ellen Grossman who gets involved on things like this, and Global news also has a reporter. Neither Bas Pro nor Tracker are going to want that kind of publicity. Heck, maybe you and smalliefisher can park side by side if he still has his - that would really pack a statement  You've been jerked, IMO, and waaaaaay more patient and understanding that I would have been. Good luck."
463913,fishindevil,2010-05-07 10:33:00,6254,"well i feel for you as well in 2000 i bought a new tracker pro-guide 16ft and within the first few times of having it in the water the paint started to lift off the hull,and it just kept getting worse,and the paint was literally floating off the side of the hull,well after almost a year of being on the phone and complaining to tracker in missisippi,they took my boat back to get it repainted,werll the problem was it wasnt etched properly,and i had it to two specialists in the marine painting area to verify this before tracker would take it back,well it was gone for over 4 months,and they left it sitting with the cover off,and the scorching sun down there bleached the whole one side of my boat seats as well and cracked all the tires beyond belief....long story short all they did was repaint it and sent it back...get this they did not re-etch the paint so after 2 fishing trips it started to peel paint again.....i called a lawyer and paid for him to send a letter of intent to sue.and they gave me my money back and i promptly sold it....i had also spent about 50 bucks on my phone bill as well...they treated me like crap too,i will never ever deal with them again,so best of luck,and call a layer but first get a profesional estimate or call a marine insurance surveyer and im sure they will deem it unsafe and write it off then sue...good luck    shawn"
463919,Blake,2010-05-07 11:10:00,418,Hope all get resolved and sorry about what you are going through.  I looked at them years ago when I bought my Lund.  Glad I did.
