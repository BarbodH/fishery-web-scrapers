We want to peg it down and I only want to bring my cordless drill and one bit if possible. Should I bring a bit for wood or for metal? My guess is wood. One of the hut operators is taxiing us out there and don't know if they would do that, and maybe even drill some fishing holes too. I think it is Grangers that we are using for the taxi and minnows. Thanks. Splashhopper."
