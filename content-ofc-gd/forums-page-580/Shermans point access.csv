547147,mike rousseau,2011-02-03 00:51:00,4661,Looking for directions or the name of a road that will get me the closest to shermans point to walk out... Last year a buddy took me to a boat ramp in hay bay... But that was quite a hike... Any help Wouk be great fellas... Please
547151,kevin booth,2011-02-03 00:58:00,57,theres only one launch and its a long way out to the point.
547154,kevin booth,2011-02-03 01:00:00,57,its on bayveiw rd or shermins point rd will take you there as well.
547235,mike rousseau,2011-02-03 03:35:00,4661,Is there anywhere closer to the point tho?
547280,tknohpy,2011-02-03 11:45:00,162,none that I know of other than private access
547287,superdad,2011-02-03 13:04:00,353,"That Ramp off Bayview is the sole access to the ice near Shermans Pt. Anything else closer would be through private property, it's great if you know someone who'll let you park.  There is NO parkingon Shermans Point Road.  It sure is a 'bit' of a walk if you want to fish near the Red marker at Shermans or in the Reach.  Lotsa Luck  David  aka  Superdad"
547407,mike rousseau,2011-02-03 20:21:00,4661,I walked it before and I'm nit too pumped about doing it again... But it was worth it last time... We caught   fish and had a couple pigs on as  well... Maybe I should spread my wings and try another area till I buy a toy to help get me out there... Any ideas on an area with a shorter walk...
547528,tknohpy,2011-02-04 02:37:00,162,Huffs is not too far of a walk
