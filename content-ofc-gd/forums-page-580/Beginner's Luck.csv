547480,Guidofisherman,2011-02-04 00:45:00,206,"I waited til there was a nice winter storm to post this abbreviated story from early September (2010). The pop-out photos of several fish were created using Photoshop Elements 9.  Beginner's Luck Don't you just hate it when someone blindly succeeds the very first time when you have been toiling for eons. Now, I'm not jealous of their initial accomplishment, just amazed at how luck plays a part in success. Case in point...I admit to being a brook trout fanatic and while not particularly skilled, I have had a modicum of success. However, on this trip into Brook Trout Heaven, skill had nothing to do with success, just blind luck.    For years, I have been trying to arrange a trip for one of my buddies who has never really been fishing for those famous Nipigon brookies. He doesn't have the commitment to fishing like I do, yet it was an opportunity to spend a few days reminiscing and possibly catching a few. I had been telling my buddy about the brook trout fishing whenever we met at various family functions. Now it was time to ""put my money where my mouth was"" and take him for his first Nipigon brook trout. So the trip was set for the first week of September when the fall weather was still nice and the pesky mosquitoes all but gone. My hope was to time it so the transient brook trout would be schooling up, in anticipation of the spawning season. After all, this was John's first trip and I wanted it to be successful. It turns out, I now seem to be getting a greater kick out of seeing the expression of sheer joy on someone else's face as they catch a crimson brookie for the first time, than catching one myself. Mind you, I still have the competitive drive to catch my fair share.    ""I think I got a fish!"" he casually stated, as if it was routine. I was more surprised and elated than he, but it soon turned to disbelief. How could he catch a fish, on his second cast, with my rod, right where I told him NOT to cast? Pissed me right off!    I don't think he really knew what he had achieved. A 24"" beauty that weighed almost 7 pounds, on his second cast, with my rod, right where I told him NOT to cast. I'm not jealous, really...but I do have land for sale in Florida. To my way of thinking, it was now time to return it to Brook Trout Heaven, when he shocked me with this statement. ""I think I'll keep it!"" My mind began to race as I conjured up my strategy to politely, yet decisively say to return it. Torn between telling him the truth and lying to protect the fish, I chose an alternate path. ""Yes, ...it is a legal keeper of over 22"". ""You can keep it,"" I said, ""but it will be a long swim back to the trailer!"" I did feel a little guilty putting the pressure on him to release the fish. Mind you, he did agree it was the right thing to do.  Enough of that beginner's luck. Alan  "
547481,kickingfrog,2011-02-04 00:48:00,8333,Great story. Beautiful fish.
547485,danc,2011-02-04 00:57:00,4677,"Great read Al. And beautiful photos with awesome post processing.  Although I never saw the fish, I'm happy to say that I was there to congratulate John that day. That was the day before the storm of the century hit, and the first time in about twenty years that I went fishless on Nipigon.  With any luck, ice out is only 3 short months away.."

547611,Ron,2011-02-04 07:48:00,1683,"yup, same as DanC,  First time in years where we drove for a total of 30 some odd hours for the weekend only to have predicted wind speeds go from 10km/hr to be changed to wind gusts up to 90/km!  Thanks Environment Canada, you hit that weather forecast right on the head.  Ended up breaking into someones trailer for the night cause our tent was left to be a mere 16 inches off the ground. All but one tent pole was broken.  Left the owner a note with my email address on it plus a full tank of Propane, explaining the situation and the dire straights we were in. Low and behold it was Guidofisherman's trailer we had to crash in for the night.  Long story short, he saved our backside was happy we made a wise decision. Once again, I thank you for that Al.  The fishing can get real serious up there though.  <object style=""height: 390px; width: 640px""><param name=""movie"" value=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ux3YfEr7dPo?version=3""><param'>http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ux3YfEr7dPo?version=3""><param name=""allowFullScreen"" value=""true""><param name=""allowScriptAccess"" value=""always""><embed src=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ux3YfEr7dPo?version=3"" type=""application/x-shockwave-flash"" allowfullscreen=""true"" allowScriptAccess=""always"" width=""640"" height=""390""></object>  <object style=""height: 390px; width: 640px""><param name=""movie"" value=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5wZOzhaXDo?version=3""><param'>http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5wZOzhaXDo?version=3""><param name=""allowFullScreen"" value=""true""><param name=""allowScriptAccess"" value=""always""><embed src=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5wZOzhaXDo?version=3"" type=""application/x-shockwave-flash"" allowfullscreen=""true"" allowScriptAccess=""always"" width=""640"" height=""390""></object>"
