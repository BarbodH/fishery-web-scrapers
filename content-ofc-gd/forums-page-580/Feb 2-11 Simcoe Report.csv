Throughout the day I marked some great schools, but not all seemed hungry. I called in most fish with the jigging rap and sealed the deal with a Williams half and half. The bottom one in the pic was 5lbs and the top one was 4 lbs 11 oz; both fought like absolute champs! Lots of fish out there, just have to get on them! Darcy "
