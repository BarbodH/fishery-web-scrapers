545999,Raf,2011-01-31 19:36:00,3495, Haha  but unless they are duratracs they'd be better off recycled into condoms.
546000,Spiel,2011-01-31 19:36:00,9065, Hahahahahaha....
546002,misfish,2011-01-31 19:41:00,29133,"LOL Wayne  G,I run coopers on my truck.Been on there 2 years.Good tire IMO."
546012,kickingfrog,2011-01-31 19:51:00,8333," Tires, truck or GF?"
546022,solopaddler,2011-01-31 20:10:00,8605,  All three.
546128,vinnimon,2011-02-01 00:43:00,2593,"Ford f150s and also the larger ones are famous for center links, tie rod ends, steering shock etc. Esp when used for commercial purposes. The e and f 350 series were the worst.  I had an issue with my jeep a little while back, The death wobble. I replaced all the necesary components and the wobble came back. I had the wheels balanced as well. The problem persisted. At 90 to 105 kph it shook enough to scare even a stunt driver.  I switch over to my winter rims a tires, problem went away I split up the old tires and rims to find a litre of water in one tire. The same tire that kept leaking down and using a certain shops air supply  Only to find out that they never drain their air compressor tank.  If the tire shop ran my tire at a higher speed while balancing it, it would of saved a lot of grief for me."
546179,taper,2011-02-01 02:34:00,611,"Gerrit Cooper makes some very good tires, especially when comparing them along side the premier brands. I have always felt that the Michelin LTX was the best light truck tire ever made and still believe that but they come with a very heavy price tag as well. I run the LTX on my truck but mostly because the wife works for a tire company and I got a great deal. I have put Coopers on a lot of my families vehicles and have not regretted one yet."
546186,Sinker,2011-02-01 02:44:00,8692,"Ya, I've ran coopers too. They were fine.  S."
546270,Fish4Eyes,2011-02-01 13:29:00,1022,I have Coopers on my 4Runner. Their not that great.  Check your PM Gerritt.
546272,Uncle Buck,2011-02-01 13:37:00,1000,Michelin LTX Gerritt... things will last forever...
546281,Raf,2011-02-01 14:00:00,3495,ltx's are great if y0u never leave the pavement
546389,jedimaster,2011-02-01 18:40:00,3472,Price out some BFG AT KO's They have the best mix of rugged performance and streetability. These are used extensivly by offroaders that need to run the same tires on the road and have a GF or Wife that hates the MT grumble....
546390,misfish,2011-02-01 18:48:00,29133,"  Atleast they,ll out last yer truck Goran."
546495,bubbles,2011-02-01 21:55:00,591, What he said
546516,Gerritt,2011-02-01 22:32:00,6129,Thanks guys much appreciated.  G
547404,Uncle Buck,2011-02-03 20:05:00,1000," Ha!!  Changed the head gasket, intake gasket, exhaust manifold gaskets, tie-rods, ball joints, sleeves, idler arm, pitman arm, rad, water pump, front brakes, tires, alignment, pcv, switched out the death-cool...  we'll see who outlasts who, me the truck or the truck me..."
545864,Gerritt,2011-01-31 16:02:00,6129,"This truck has been bullet proof, Ford F150.  Today I noticed a shaking in the front end, it is slow and consistant, and I can see the steering wheel move back and forth left to right.. it even seems the front of the trucks is swaying back and forth..(maybe an optical illusion?) it only seems to do this @ slow speeds.. on  the Highway it seems to disappear? any thoughts before I take it in fellas? and approx cost to repair?  Thanks!  G"
545867,irishfield,2011-01-31 16:04:00,26272,Warped brake disk..
545874,chessy,2011-01-31 16:11:00,610,might be a bad tire .. feel for any buldges.. some times a belt just lets go  and the slow speed makes me think thats what it is .. i had one in the van in the back end ... felt like you were in a milkshake blender but once got up to speed it dissapeard ..
545876,SmokestackLightnin,2011-01-31 16:14:00,390,Most likely a tire or rim causing the issue.  Typically warped discs won't rear their ugly head until brake application when they will pulsate.  
545878,Gerritt,2011-01-31 16:15:00,6129,Just so happens my girlfriend hit 2 curbs in a Tim Hortons drive through... all in one day! wonder if it is related   :wallbash:
545881,irishfield,2011-01-31 16:17:00,26272,LOL.. and she admitted it! Rim or side wall then...
545882,cityfisher,2011-01-31 16:18:00,959,"Id bet on a bent rim, seen it before"
545885,SmokestackLightnin,2011-01-31 16:19:00,390,"  Ladies and Gentlemen, I think we have a winner."
545886,Gerritt,2011-01-31 16:19:00,6129,I was in  the truck when she did it LOL! just did not put two and two together till now!... She'll pay.... ohhhh yes she will pay!
545889,Raf,2011-01-31 16:22:00,3495,have you snow packed in your wheels?
545901,SmokestackLightnin,2011-01-31 16:37:00,390,"  Another good suggestion, the thing about snow/ice packing is usually it will make noise at slow speeds but not cause vibrations until higher speeds."
545903,mercman,2011-01-31 16:41:00,7054,  Ya right !! ya better back that up with pictures
545908,misfish,2011-01-31 16:45:00,29133," Was going to say the same. I just went through this.Dont ask how it got there. Lets just say,I drive like Dale."
545916,Raf,2011-01-31 16:58:00,3495,life's more fun sideways misfish
545919,irishfield,2011-01-31 17:01:00,26272,The 2003 F150 steel wheels are terrible water/ice holders as well..
545920,Bernie,2011-01-31 17:01:00,3190,Bad tire most likely Gerritt. Every time the bump in the tire hits the road it pushes on the wheel. It may be a bent rim but it would have to be bent quite a lot.
545924,bigbuck,2011-01-31 17:08:00,2449,Could just be a bad tire. Best take it in and have the front end inspected as well.
545925,skeeter,2011-01-31 17:11:00,1907,I think it's just a loose nut behind the steering wheel!
545928,solopaddler,2011-01-31 17:17:00,8605,We're taking mine in September.
545941,Sinker,2011-01-31 17:54:00,8692,I had the same deal with mine yesterday. It was snow/ice/slush in the backside of my rims. Doesn't help that I was driving all over scugog thru a foot of snow/slush in -20 temps  S.
545961,DRIFTER_016,2011-01-31 18:44:00,10439,I have the same issues when I power wash my wheels after running down dirt roads in the wet. The dirt builds up on the back sied of the wheel and if you don't wash real well there are sections left behind that really throw off the balance of the wheel. Sometimes so bad your vision blurs.
545988,Gerritt,2011-01-31 19:23:00,6129,Thanks for the advice every one. I took it in and was a bad tire. I had them throw on my snow tires and will look for a good set of all seasonals come the spring. They recommended a set of Cooper LT's for 180 a piece. Not too sure on the Cooper brand however..  Thanks again guys!  G
545990,Raf,2011-01-31 19:26:00,3495,"Cooper's aren't too bad.  Firestone Destination are an excellent tire for the price if I may make a recommendation.  I run the All Terrain version and I paid quite a bit less than 180/tire for my Jeep.  They rate as good or better than the Bridgestone Dueler ATs.  Check their ratings out on tirerack.com.  There's a less agressive Long Trail, LE, highway or all season version too"
545993,Spiel,2011-01-31 19:29:00,9065, Think I mentioned that.  The trouble is not so much with the tire as it is with who you let drive the truck....
545995,irishfield,2011-01-31 19:33:00,26272,You can buy an expensive new set of Goodyear Wrangler's at 0% financing over 6 years.. comes with a free 2011 F150
