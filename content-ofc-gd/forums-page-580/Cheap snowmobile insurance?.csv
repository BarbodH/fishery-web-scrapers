545238,mike rousseau,2011-01-29 22:09:00,4661,Looking for the cheapest snowmobile insurance to make me legal... Looking to buy a 1992 arctic cat 700cc to try some long distance ice fishing... Any help fellas?  Please!
545242,misfish,2011-01-29 22:16:00,29133,Give RBC a call.
545246,Dondorfish,2011-01-29 22:23:00,1000,Just switched mine to TD - saved approx $110.00 per year.   Tracker (Don)
545252,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2011-01-29 22:34:00,0,"i have mine through intact. if you have other accounts somewhere, you can use those as leverage to get a good price.  my insurance isn't that bad."
545268,Old Man,2011-01-29 23:04:00,822,"Depends on what you want. All you need to be legal in Ontario is 3rd Party Liability. I got one million coverage through RBC for $105/year. Comprehensive (theft, fire, vandalism) was an extra $83/year for a 2007 Arctic Cat Panther with a $500 deductible. Of course, if your talking All Perils, that will cost more."
545310,porkpie,2011-01-30 00:29:00,2521,"I have one million 3rd party liability on my quad and nothing else. It's an older machine, and I see no need to pay for theft/fire etc.  I pay $100 a year, for four season coverage.  If you have an older machine don't let them suck you into full coverage, it will double your costs!  Make sure to lump it in with your house, car etc, as was mentioned and you'll get the better deal.  I deal with the personal, but we get a discount through our employer.  I've found them very competitive!"
545314,mike rousseau,2011-01-30 00:41:00,4661,Thanks guys... This is great stuff
545454,duckdog,2011-01-30 17:59:00,162,TD for sure over $150 cheaper then anywhere for me and that equalled half price
545504,F7Firecat,2011-01-30 21:46:00,347,Td is the cheapest you can usually get
545784,cityfisher,2011-01-31 13:41:00,959,166 for my 99 polaris Indy classic
545837,bigbuck,2011-01-31 15:06:00,2449,Just be careful when lumping all of your insurance under one carrier. Any claims affect everything so it can be very expensive if something ever happens. Just shop around.
547386,irishfield,2011-02-03 18:52:00,26272,Just did it this morning for a '98 Skidoo 500 Touring SLE.. bare minimum for PLPD $157 + tax... $180.
547387,BillM,2011-02-03 19:03:00,17367,My sled was $176 + tax.  Watch out Lake Simcoe!  Although it looks like I'm going to need a trailer... Wayne you wanna whip me up a single tilt trailer?  lol
547475,steelhedrmatt,2011-02-04 00:13:00,278,"I also have ins. with TD. 160 For a 99 indy 500.  Cityfisher, is that the classic touring?"
