Watched her cruise by under our portable a few times then finally grabbed my minnow. snapped at the knot on one of those davidson perch rigs.  Nice catch man."

547369,trophypikehunter,2011-02-03 17:49:00,89, Thanks everybody!!   I make my own rig similar to the Quick Strike Rig except mine is a horizontal hold I call it the Dead Strike Rig.. The red light was the reflection from my camera and I would say that pike weighed between 7-10 pounds maybe..
