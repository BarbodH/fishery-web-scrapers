547839,irishfield,2011-02-04 21:52:00,26272,"Yep.. go out and say hello and ask if they mind if they fish with them, or close to them, since you're solo. It might go a long way to making it an enjoyable day.  It also might get you told off.. you never know, but at least you know where you stand.  We have ""grumpy Dave"" up at camp. We starting fishing HIS point one day, only to have him and son come ripping out on sleds (from 1000 feet away) to state ""We're fishing here"".. yah in iced over holes. Ron had fun with that one.. can you say Swiss cheese. lol !  Lloyd and I fish with Dave now every time we come in off the main lake.. (whether he likes it or not)."
