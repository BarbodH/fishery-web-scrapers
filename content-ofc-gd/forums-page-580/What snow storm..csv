547000,Rattletrap2,2011-02-02 18:36:00,1652,"My Wife and I stayed in Brampton last night rather than risk heading home and having to struggle back in this morning. She suggested that we get a motel room and call it an early Valentines! I agreed! We went out for dinner, shared a bottle of wine, and....... who is complaining about the media hype? Not me!"
547007,lookinforwalleye,2011-02-02 18:47:00,4399,  Didn`t realize you were such a romantic Brian!!!

547031,Phranchise,2011-02-02 20:01:00,10,Shoveled about 15-20 cm this morning in St. Catharines. Heard lots of wind last night but whenever I rolled over and looked outside it never seemed too bad. For the last hour or two it has been coming down good tho. Winter wonderland. Gotta love media hype..they closed Brock University at 6 am this morning.
547041,misfish,2011-02-02 20:18:00,29133," Hey J. When ya get home,go rippen the streets with the sled. Ye,ll freak them all out.LOL"

547047,express168,2011-02-02 20:34:00,327,I had 3 foot drifts in my driveway this morning on Upper Stoney Creek. I still got my truck out and to the office a little late but none of the co-workers made it so I am reading the OFC board because not alot of guys calling for construction materials today.
547049,Joey,2011-02-02 20:37:00,9122,"  I am home B, worked from home today like the rest of my co-workers.  I've been wanting to ride the sled down the streets all day"
547052,Handlebarz,2011-02-02 20:41:00,3790,  LOL I was supposed to head to Fleetwood today and pick up two loads I called the office and let them know I was not driving in this stuff that was at 4am. I waited until 8am and ran the snow blower for 3 hours doing all the side walks and ends of the neighbours driveways. I did get a small break when i went to get some more gas.  I hope things are better tomorrow we will be back at work for sure.  Anyone who has a sled in the chatham area please pass by my house I love to here them it brings back great memories
547119,SRT8 smoker craft,2011-02-03 00:01:00,1107, Would have been tough to get there they had hwy WC and 59 closed at the 401 lots if drifting and the clear spots were icy.
547135,mercman,2011-02-03 00:35:00,7054,  We will have a few less drivers on the road here tomorrow.Huge pile up on the 20 to Quebec today.I heard 50 cars and trucks.
547286,fish_fishburn,2011-02-03 13:02:00,1311,We got about 6 or 7 inches here yesterday.  The roads were good all day.  Plows kept everything open and everything moving normal.  We didnt have any wind so no drifting. Of course the schools were all open but no buses running.  Heard on the news at 6 am there would be no buses running yesterday and it didnt start snowing here till 8am.  The kids had a P.D. day on monday anad no school yesterday.  I was wondering why are all P.D. days on friday and monday's only? Nice for a long weekend once a month for teachers plus all the other days they get off. They wonder why they get a bad rap from alot of parents.  I'm not picking on teachers here...just saying.
546856,Guest gbfisher,2011-02-02 14:23:00,0,Not sure what it's doing around town but they've closed schools and cancelled just about everything and for what? What's it doing where you live? I think we've had about 3 inches of snow. They've even plowed the roads which they don't normally do until we get at least six inches and it usually don't plow for a good day or two after the fact. You'd think we lived way down south where they never see snow.
546857,misfish,2011-02-02 14:27:00,29133,"Enjoy that Andy,cause ya aint going to enjoy the walking on Simcoe.Insert huff and puff."
546858,fishing n autograph,2011-02-02 14:27:00,2540,"Yeah, other than the drifts around my van and the 3 foot pile of snow the plow left there wasn't really anything to shovel"
546859,Harrison,2011-02-02 14:27:00,2202,"We got it somewhat good in Clarington, but the wife still loaded the van and drove the girls to school.  Took me an extra 20mins to get into downtown TO.  Total media hype.  Kind of annoying really, you can't help but anticipate something ""big"" to happen.  I like true snow days.  Although, I think the biggest disapointment is for the kids who's schools are open.  Probably more snow in the Motley Crue dressing room."
546863,FishAbout,2011-02-02 14:42:00,106,We are getting it here in Bracebridge. Over a foot of fresh stuff on the ground so far and still falling. Wont be good for the lakes here.  Going to be hard going for any machine now.
546867,bubbles,2011-02-02 14:58:00,591,"Just shoveled about a foot, can't wait for the plow to go by!"
546876,SRT8 smoker craft,2011-02-02 15:04:00,1107,  it's pretty crappy here both major roads to the 401 are closed I tried to go to work but got turned around at a road block apparently there's a 100 meter snow drift thats atleast 5' deep blocking the hiway.
546882,cityfisher,2011-02-02 15:14:00,959,"we got like 5-6 cms in richmond hill, I drove into the office. The news was WAYYYYYYY OFF"
546888,ADB,2011-02-02 15:21:00,444," Yeah, I measured 8cms in my driveway in Richmond Hill.  Nowhere near the 20-25cm they were predicting."
546891,fishing n autograph,2011-02-02 15:26:00,2540,There's about 6 inches on my deck and I cleared it off the day before
546898,mercman,2011-02-02 15:34:00,7054,"Montreal is like a walk in the park. Around about 6 inches, and small drifts on side streets, about a foot or so.Still snowing and winds around 40 clicks.  "
546902,stubbex1,2011-02-02 15:41:00,164," I live in mt elgin, and work in Tillsonburg, i have no idea why they closed #19 it was clear all the way to t-burg.  In town is pretty bad though, like you said big drifts.   "
546933,tb4me,2011-02-02 16:41:00,3295,we got a good 8 to 10 inches here in Brantford..the drift are packed solid and very hard to shovel.I finally got to use the snows on the big red ram...4x4 is fun...That 5 footer would have been fun to get thru...where is ti I want to go play..
546943,Sinker,2011-02-02 16:53:00,8692,"Well, all i want to say is "" I told ya so"". Christ, they CLOSED my kids school, with about 5"" of snow on the ground. And you wonder why poeple freak out with a bit of snow.........they're taught it in school!!! What a JOKE!!  S."
546944,BillM,2011-02-02 16:54:00,17367,Still snowing here in Barrie.  Nothing out of the ordinary though.
546948,Rizzo,2011-02-02 16:58:00,4754,"agree with Bill...typical day in Barrie, wake up to 6-8 inches in the driveway but the roads are great (other than my own which must be last one the route)"
546952,fishing n autograph,2011-02-02 17:02:00,2540,The CKCO noon news were showing road closures ...Hwy 21 in Godrich is closed but it was hilarious to see sleds rippin down the closed roads
546953,mercman,2011-02-02 17:03:00,7054,"  i HEAR YA S !!! When i was a kid, i'd walk to school 5 miles.Only had 2 left boots, casue my brother only had a right leg.We'd have to share mits and hats on different days.Dad got paid once a month, so bologna sangwiches only had bologna in them 2 or 3 times a month.The resy of the time it was mustard only. AND WE WERE HAPPY !!! Today, i have a huge snowblower,a AWD vehicule, never eat bologna, and have 60 pairs of winter boots MAN AM I HAPPY !!!!!"
546955,bigbuck,2011-02-02 17:08:00,2449,"About 6 inches in Oakville. Nothing too bad. We got a call from the school board at 6:45am to let us know that the school is closed. GREAT, only problem, my girls go on Tuesdays and Thursdays and alternating Fridays. DUH!!!"
546959,RickOnt,2011-02-02 17:23:00,669,"Still Snowing here Big Time and looking at thr Radar it does not appear to be finished any time soon  Looks like the Storm may have tracked further North than predicted  I was wishing for 2-4"" not 10"" plus   rick"
546960,fishing n autograph,2011-02-02 17:25:00,2540,Snow has picked up here too... They called off the winter storm warning but from what I saw this morning the snow is worse now
546961,Joey,2011-02-02 17:26:00,9122,"Well Richmond Hill is getting it good now!!!  Coming down pretty good for the last little while, and lots of it fast!"
546967,4x4bassin,2011-02-02 17:46:00,1025,It is snowing really hard for the last couple hours here in northern dufferin !
546981,SRT8 smoker craft,2011-02-02 18:02:00,1107,The cop told me that it was really bad north of mt elgin he told me to stay home if I could the drifting was the worst part around here.
546985,stubbex1,2011-02-02 18:11:00,164," yup the cop was right   I just talked to my dad, he lives on Mcbeth and it sounds like its alot worse there.  I know there's a stretch north of salford on the first bend that gets drifted over really bad....i'm assuming thats where the 100 meter drift was."
