547043,express168,2011-02-02 20:27:00,327,"Hi guys I am back after a while but had to add to this post, I cleared half my drive this morning to get the work truck out, but cleared all the sidewalk up the neighbourhood with my snowblower. We have a guy around the corner with a landscape and plowing company that plowed a lane down the street and through the big plow drift at the end of the street so we could get on the main road. I called the wife this afternoon and she told me that my neighbour ( retired firefighter) cleaned the rest of our drive because he feels guilty that we get most of the snow drifts as opposed to him ( great guy)! There are 4 of us with snowblowers and we will always helpthe other neighbours and clear as much of the sidewalks as we can, hell I already started the machine whats anothers 2 bucks of gas to help my neighbours out and they do the same in return."
547051,solopaddler,2011-02-02 20:40:00,8605," No, they're friendly but they keep to themselves."
547053,solopaddler,2011-02-02 20:43:00,8605,From reading everyone's replies I think I may have stumbled onto something here.  Tangible proof that there's hope for mankind.  Sounds as though you'd ALL make great neighbours.
547059,DRIFTER_016,2011-02-02 20:57:00,10439,  Then their wives place clear plastic over their driveways so they don't get dirty again.
547060,SlowPoke,2011-02-02 21:02:00,2984,Where we used to live there was an elderly couple beside us. At first it was a little annoying but you have to have some compassion and patiance for our elders. I showed them how to bend at the knees to releive some back strain and it wasn't long before they mastered the technique; they could have my driveway done in under an hour  Today was spent patroling the neighbourhood after dropping my wife off at work. We haven't seen a plow yet and I don't think we will for a couple of days (that's the norm). I ended up towing/pushing or driving 11 vehicles out of snow drifts and trail grooming with the Suburban so the other vehicles in the neighbourhood could get in and out.  Ironic that I should be maintaining the road and hauling my garbage back to the house because it wasen't picked up on the same day that I get my invoice for 5 easy payments of $900 for property taxes.
547065,crappieperchhunter,2011-02-02 21:22:00,2582,"Our old neighbor used to really look after Debbe. If I was gone in the spring on a fly in fishing trip he would always cut the grass for her. And in the winter I swore he sat at his window and if he saw her out shoveling snow he would be out immediately with his snowblower to do it for her. If he saw me out there he would just come out to talk  :blahblah1:  So it became a little game we played at our house if it snowed. Debbe would go out first and start shoveling. If Ben never showed up I would go out and finish it.  He blew  alot of snow for us over the years with his snow blower so I made sure he always got lotsa goodies from my vegetable garden in the summer. And he was always happy to get the 2 or 3 hens I kept every year for roe. We have been blessed with alot of great neighbors really, I'm glad we moved here in 1988."
547073,Big Cliff,2011-02-02 21:51:00,6899,"What goes around, comes around!  Really makes me feel good to hear stories like this!"
547076,lew,2011-02-02 22:11:00,12766,"Well, since I posted 2 hours ago about doing everybodies driveways plus the road, we've had another 3-4"" of snow and it's still coming down hard and looks like I did nuthin all day.  Oh well, at least now I've got something to do tomorrow"
547078,Rich Clemens,2011-02-02 22:13:00,3131,"We do the very same thing around here.  First one out and about - takes care of the other.  I try to get out first, as my neighbor (and fishing buddy) has some heart concerns - so I'd rather take care of his walks and driveway.   Out new snow-blower is coming in handy."
547091,GBW,2011-02-02 22:38:00,8460,I hear ya Lew!  But I have to work tomorrow so I guess one last go around 10PM and then the rest are to fend for themselves and do it.
547099,DRIFTER_016,2011-02-02 22:56:00,10439,When I was living out in the country near Luther Marsh our neighbour would come and do our driveway after a big storm. Two passes and our 220 foot driveway would be clear. Gotta like the old John Dear tracter with the 8' double auger bolwer mounted on the back.  When my dad had his heart attack in the middle of winter a few years ago and the ambulance couldn't get up the driveway the neighbours were there in a pinch to blow the driveway.
547116,NAW,2011-02-02 23:54:00,4022,"There.  2.5 driveways done.  1 tank of gas.  Dinners in the oven.  A little break on the couch, then back to work to burn it at both ends.."
547118,Mattones,2011-02-02 23:56:00,587,I was out from 530am-10pm snow blowing almost my entire street it felt like. I enjoy it
547163,vinnimon,2011-02-03 01:16:00,2593,"My neighbours are awesome, 3 of them watch the kids until I get home, without hesitation. Both neighbour on either side of me are older, and likewise, I help them as much as possible. I use the neighbours snow blower and do everyones driveway, leaving mine for last."
547181,Handlebarz,2011-02-03 01:54:00,3790,This is Canada guys what do you expect for most cases the only time we see our neighbors is when some one yells out there front door FREE BEER  MY HOUSE TONIGHT or when  we get heavy snow. That is how my neighborhood is I just met Frank today we have both lived on the street over 11 years and never met always said Hi when passing or waved but never stopped to chat until he caught me doing his driveway today LOL.  I will always do the sidewalks here and end of driveways after MR. Plow comes by just to help out.  It is sad that there is a lady living next door to me with twin 20 year old boys in great shape but they will not get out to do there side walks or back driveway to lazy or cant get the long pipe from there mouths   to help her out. But across the street his son drives over to do there place after doing all other family members houses I try and get there first.  Cu-does to all who help out after all that is what were supposed to do I guess.
547222,rob v,2011-02-03 03:16:00,535,One of my favourite things to do - clear several of the neighbours drives around me. Takes me about 10 minutes to clear my little drive most of the time - the blower barely gets warmed up - so off i go to find more to do.  Everyone is grateful and that's all that matters. I can't stand to see any of my older neighbours out there struggling with a bloody shovel.  Some day if I'm lucky enough to get old - maybe someone will think of me.  In the mean time it's great to help out my  neighbours and be part of the neighbourhood.
547327,TJQ,2011-02-03 15:33:00,7806,I guess I shouldn't shoot at my neighbors.... they may be more friendly... whodathunkit??
547328,mercman,2011-02-03 15:37:00,7054,I love mine too. Too bad the police wont let me within 100 metres of thier house anymore
547334,ketchenany,2011-02-03 15:42:00,3229,"  Went home early yesterday to clean up and my driveway was done! tat was treat and had a good idea who did it with the lunch they had! What the heck everyone else had also cleaned up except for my next door. Had started the blower for a why so away I went at it. As I brushed off the blower he pull up, loved the look on his face! Anytime I need stainless steel he is my man."
547368,Fish4Eyes,2011-02-03 17:47:00,1022,"I was shovelling the snow the plow had left at the bottom of my driveway last night, when one of my female 35yrs old ish neighbours appears and asks me if I need some help. Needless to say I was rather suprised, considering i'm 25 and not exactly a spring chicken. Something tells me she wanted something else  ..... . The wife was indoors, and the nice guy that I am I didn't want her feeling guilty for not helping me, so I declined the offer."
547422,Jewelbee,2011-02-03 21:21:00,422,I have an awesome neighbor also....his son has a four wheeler with a plow and my driveway is done by the time I roll in from work  Kudos to great neighbors
546935,solopaddler,2011-02-02 16:44:00,8605,Just made it home from work and my neighbour cleaned out my entire driveway and walkway with his snowblower.  Some of the drifts were waist deep.  There is a God.
546937,fishing n autograph,2011-02-02 16:46:00,2540,"That's awesome...  My neighbour has a 12 year old son....when he wants to make easy money he knocks on my door and asks if he could shovel my drive way. Anytime there's been snow there he is...except for today, i guess there was too much for him lol"
546938,tb4me,2011-02-02 16:47:00,3295,nice!! im that neighbour here.. i love to clear now usually but thoe drift were brutal.. packed solid! we have a snowblower in the shed that hasnt run in 3 years..good thng for the 18 yr old in our house  ...
546945,Rizzo,2011-02-02 16:54:00,4754,where we used to live I had an older lady next door...gave me more time to play with my snowblower! Was a win win situation.
546947,msp,2011-02-02 16:57:00,1336,How was the snow out your way ?
546949,bigbuck,2011-02-02 16:58:00,2449,"I'm the pretty good neighbour too. I do the sidewalk for about 4-5 houses on either side of me. I don't do the driveways though, if someone wants to use my snowblower, no problem. I'll be out later cleaning the windrows after the plow comes by for a few of the neighbours."
546950,BillM,2011-02-02 16:59:00,17367,"My neighbour is an older gentlemen (probably 70-75 years old) when he first moved in he came over with a $50 bill and asked if I minded taking care of his driveway for the winter.  I told him to keep the $50 and that I'd be glad to.  So now he's smartened up and buys me $50 gift certificates to the LCBO every year, lol.   Those are hard to say no to"
546957,solopaddler,2011-02-02 17:18:00,8605,"I love having great neighbours. It's such a nice change from our two previous places.  All the guys love to fish, big parties all over the street in the summer, everyone helps each other out. It's a dead end street with tons of kids...best move we ever made."
546987,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2011-02-02 18:12:00,0,"and after a real long shift no less...  i have a lot of older italian gents in my neighborhood so i don't get much help, but it is amusing to see them have their driveway perfectly scraped to concrete at all times.  some of these old retired guys are so vigilant, i wonder if they catch the snowflakes before they even hit the drive way.  the same guys water their driveways all summer to ensure no dirt/dust is ever present..."
546990,solopaddler,2011-02-02 18:15:00,8605,"  You just described me.   Pretty much every one of my neighbours is Italian too, they're fantastic."
546999,ketchenany,2011-02-02 18:33:00,3229, Do you live on my street? I have two guys (italian) in their 70s that practically wash theirs. I seen one guy when I moved in wash his driveway after a rain storm.
547002,Spiel,2011-02-02 18:42:00,9065,Hey my neighbour is out there helping my 15 year old son do our drive and sidewalk after she finished doing her own. Sadly though her own 15 year old son is sleeping while his Mom does all the work.....  Oh and how is Zoey liking all this snow Mike?
547003,lookinforwalleye,2011-02-02 18:43:00,4399,"I don`t mind helping out the elderly couple next to me, not fun watching a couple seniors dry humping a shovel trying to move that 3 foot x 3 foot snow bank that the town dumps in front of their driveway. Sometime I think these plowdrivers get a kick out of it!"
547004,JoshS,2011-02-02 18:43:00,729," I live in the ""little italy"" of toronto and have a lot of elder neighbours... I help a lot out with the shoveling but my neighbour directly next door to me must be 80+ and will not let me touch his walkway. He says it's his only excuse to get away from his wife and her mouth hahaha. All year his walkway is the cleanest on the block all the way to the alleyway in the back. Also nice to have someone to dish some steelhead fillets too time to time!"
547005,SRT8 smoker craft,2011-02-02 18:44:00,1107,My nieghbor came to the rescue to after the plow pushed that big drift the cop got stuck in right into our driveways
547006,GBW,2011-02-02 18:46:00,8460,"well, I guess I'm that guy too.  I have 2 houses beside me with retired people in them so I fire up the snowblower and do them and mine.  as well as the sidewalk on the other side as my wife needs to use it to take the kids' from her homedaycare (and my kids') to school and back."
547010,solopaddler,2011-02-02 18:50:00,8605," She loves the snow but she's been regressing the last 3 days. My mother's been holding down the fort while I'm at work this week and she's been giving Zoey free rein of the house.  There's been a number of ""accidents"" since Monday.  Ah well, back to hardcore crate training.   (Counting the hours 'till Joanne gets home on Sunday  )"
547012,Spiel,2011-02-02 19:00:00,9065," Sounds like your typical Mom, spoil the Grandkids, spoil the dog."
547018,cityfisher,2011-02-02 19:18:00,959,I store my quad for the winter in my grandmas garage....Its a pleasure to visit her and do her driveway for her... Even though she doesn't drive
547021,blaque,2011-02-02 19:34:00,2419,"Got the same neighborhood situation goin on here as well. When the snow flies.......everyones out helping everyone clear out. We havent had any bad apple neighbors for as long as i can remember. Not just snow either........if someone gets a chord of wood dumped in the the driveway, ill be there to help stack it. If someones doin a roof, ya see neighbors stoppin over to swing a hammer. Hear a chainsaw stallin out across the street, ill go get mine out of the garage and bring it over.  Its amazing how society as a whole gets painted with that ""Me first"" brush when really i witness alot different than that on alot of occasions.  Think the closer ya get to the city life the more accurate that may be. I actually do hear of some horror stories from time to time.  Case in point, i know someone who was painting their house a couple years back and thier neighbor didnt like the color (""they had to look at it too"") So the lady kept spraying the house with the hose while the paint was wet to ruin the paint. Of course she was doing it by accident while watering her shrubs. Police had to be brought in to let the paint dry lol. I couldnt even imagine having to live next to that."
547028,HTHM,2011-02-02 19:53:00,4082,"So, Mike was the neighbour our mutual aquaintence?"
547032,lew,2011-02-02 20:01:00,12766,"I just came in awhile ago after spending nearly 3 hours with the snowblower cleaning up my place plus three of the neighbors drives too.  The plow hasn't come by yet so once I finished all the driveways I cleaned off 500' off the dirt  road too. It's only about 12' wide but no sense leaving the snow there for the plow dood to fill in all the driveways again.  I luv working outside and a day like this is a good excuse to get out there and help a few folks.  Course now, I'm looking out the window and it's snowing like crazy again"
547035,NAW,2011-02-02 20:07:00,4022,"We're all just a bunch of generous winter lovin canucks here eh!  As soon as I'm done work, I'm gunna blow my driveway, and the elderly ladies beside me.  This is her second Ontario winter.  Moved here from Kelowna BC.  She tells me this year she's going to get me a bottle of wine from an Okanagan winery..  Sounds tasty.  Didn't think you could get it in Ontario, but she says she's found a place in Barrie.."
547039,GBW,2011-02-02 20:14:00,8460,"I'm now back from doing the base of 5 driveways now that the plow has gone by.  another family was out doing a few by them too, just a few houses down.  and I know I'll have to get out there again because it's still snowing like a bugger here."
