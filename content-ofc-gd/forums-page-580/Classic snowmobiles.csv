546817,ketchenany,2011-02-02 13:09:00,3229,had this on the lake a few times.1969 Massey Ferguson! 
546823,NAW,2011-02-02 13:26:00,4022,1987 Bravo.  With some Mods fir ice fishin.  Our first sled up in Pickle Lake was a ski doo olympique.  It would start in -50Â° (sometimes..)      
546861,BUSTER,2011-02-02 14:37:00,1336,"LOL  Cant believe you gave me a ride on that sled all the way to the Falcon hotel one very cold sudbury night lonnng ago,...."
546862,stubbex1,2011-02-02 14:42:00,164," Wow that brought back some memories!  I'll have to dig some old photos of my '71 ""bang whiz"" i bought it when i was 12 and still have it.  Its in the haymow though, not much left of it."
546872,Jonny,2011-02-02 15:01:00,1380,A couple more - my father's machine in 1972 --- a Mercury...  
546884,youngvedder,2011-02-02 15:14:00,72, the sled my grandfather had...spent a lot of time on it! thanks for sharing.  yv
546899,Rod Caster,2011-02-02 15:35:00,5784,"  Bravo...same one my bro still has. He refuses to get rid of it even though it's falling apart. hehehe  Some of these sleds are incredible, like the Merc."
546915,Rattletrap2,2011-02-02 16:02:00,1652,"All of the old pictures are fantastic, but Bernie, yours are really amazing. They certainly rekindle some good memories of another time! Thanks for sharing!"
546929,BillM,2011-02-02 16:32:00,17367,I remember seeing those Phazers as a young teen and was blown away by them.  I saw one out a few days ago in Bracebridge as I was driving through and getting some diesel.  Still looks as awesome as it did 15 years ago.
546932,Sinker,2011-02-02 16:41:00,8692,"anyone run an Alpine?? We have an '84, and '85. I'll take some pics. They will go anywhere, and pull anything. We use them for packing deep snow on the X-country ski trails. They are unstopable!  S."
546969,12footspringbok,2011-02-02 17:48:00,459, I definatly seen you go tootin' by me a couple time last year on your way to long shoal?... Can't mistake the sound of the old bravo for anything.
546980,wallyboss,2011-02-02 18:00:00,1095, Unless you got them stuck in a foot and a half of slush on the way to a camp party and decided to come back the next day to get it out.  It went down to -30 overnight. took us 2 days to get it out of there. They were heavy especially with a full tank of gas.
546998,NAW,2011-02-02 18:33:00,4022, That's where the top pic is from!  Give me a wave next time you see me.
547036,12footspringbok,2011-02-02 20:11:00,459, Will do for sure.
547055,Sinker,2011-02-02 20:49:00,8692," yeah, if you get them stuck, you may as well laeave them there till spring LOL. They don't get stuck often though. Ours are going to get a workout tomorrow!! I'll get some action pics while I'm out there grooming!  S."
547103,BUSTER,2011-02-02 23:07:00,1336," Now that's Style. The 250 had a more conventional timing advance mechanism, a large chrome automotive-type air cleaner, twin headlights, a rear mounted gas tank, and a large muffler under the seat with the tailpipe exiting at the rear of the sled, under the fuel tank. Louvers ventilated the aluminum tunnel around the muffler to aid in cooling and keep the rider's legs warm. This exhaust system was also handy for cooking hot dogs wrapped in aluminum foil and tossed under the seat! The track was reinforced with steel cable because of the 250's weight, which is wisely not listed in the owner's manual but is massive. This steel cable tended to make the track as stiff as wood whenever the sled sat unused for a few hours under cold conditions. To free up the track before use, one would have to remove the hood, put the rear up on it's kickstand, and manually turn the driven sheaves backwards a few turns, to give the motor a ""running start"" at loosening up the stiffened track without burning the drive belt to shreds. The engine was a 436cc 25hp twin, with a Tillotson carb featuring a fixed, ""Mikuni-style"" high speed jet."
547127,Rod Caster,2011-02-03 00:21:00,5784,  from rc-trucks.org  They built these in over 30 years ago. Minnesota was like the Motown of snowmobiles back then and Polaris is keeping that tradition.
547134,Old Man,2011-02-03 00:34:00,822, Scorpion sold a pile of sleds back then. It's easy to see why.
547155,Jonny,2011-02-03 01:00:00,1380," Thanks, Buster! I didn't know all that. I was on my own (and living far away) by the time my Dad got this machine so I never saw much of it. I remember being impressed by the looks and the handling though. I also remember thinking that my younger brother and sister were lucky, because my parents used to like to ice fish a lot, and when I was a kid and we couldn't go out by car, we would walk or ski, dragging a toboggan.   "
547394,JohnF,2011-02-03 19:35:00,3494," I suspect you were referring to the mullti-cylinder models cuz they were definitely cooler looking but I trail rode a 292 single for a couple of years. I usually ran with the expansion chamber cuz I loved the snarl but i had a can rigged up just in case. As I recollect the lighting was a bit of a problem but we came up with a solution although for the life of me I can't remember what it was. Wish I had pics because it looked mint. Of course it was only about 3 years old but had been raced since new. I gave it a new hood, windshield and seat.  JF"
546647,Rod Caster,2011-02-02 01:47:00,5784,"1970 Blizzard is one of the coolest sleds ever in my opinion.  I also have a soft spot (and a sore back) for the 1985 Polaris SS 440. At 13 I drove one from North Bay to Huntsville, return. I couldn't play hockey or other sports for almost 2 weeks...horrible rear suspension on those things, but great memories!!     "
546649,Nipfisher,2011-02-02 01:49:00,2449,I love my tank. 1993 Skidoo Skandic II 503R. She aint pretty but if you're stuck she'll pull you out. If I'm stuck I'm walking out.
546653,Old Man,2011-02-02 01:53:00,822,Just posted this in the other thread. Great looking classic.  
546655,LefroyFisherman,2011-02-02 01:53:00,602,"I've got a 1986 Skidoo Safari runs great, good sled. I also have a 1970 OMC Snowcruiser in almost mint condition I am in the process of getting working again, original paint and the seat is perfect!"
546656,Rod Caster,2011-02-02 01:54:00,5784,"Oldman: I was just gonna repost that for you here because it's so nice.... I've never seen that before but I'm blown away!!  Is that a ""high beam"" as the second light??"
546659,Twocoda,2011-02-02 01:58:00,4130,heres a video of the first machine i had ...this isnt me i jacked it off the internet...but same machine...they came with steel tracks and when you hit some ice....it was like a balerina spinning out of control...lol... 
546663,Old Man,2011-02-02 02:06:00,822," No, the only light was the one on the left side. The vents in the top of the cowling are for the small rad. The heat exchanger was in the front bumper. As I said , my cousin rode one for a number of years. Extremely fast and probably one of the best riding sleds in it's day. 440 liquid cooled Xenoah engine, came original with an Arctic Cat Hex clutch which everyone soon replace with a Comet 102. Although you can't really see it in this picture, the chrome ski's were hot looking."
546666,Old Man,2011-02-02 02:09:00,822,The two best looking sleds Cat ever made. IMO    
546672,BUSTER,2011-02-02 02:16:00,1336,1971 800 King Cat about $15 000.00 restored.
546675,Bernie,2011-02-02 02:24:00,3190,"This is when they made a sled. Kinda hard to hurt yourself on this one. I'm the little guy on the seat ahead of my mom.   And my dads old 68 Snow Crusher in the background.   An old Moto Ski, not sure what year. An old family friend with a few pickerel. "
546678,Old Man,2011-02-02 02:27:00,822, The 650 King Kat with the JLO triple is a rare sled. The 800 Quad even more so. Only 124 of them made.  
546694,Old Man,2011-02-02 02:51:00,822,"The sled that most of us old guys started with. The first I ever drove. 1966 Ski Doo Olympique 250. Only 247cc, but she could go through a ton of powder.    "
546696,Rod Caster,2011-02-02 02:53:00,5784,Beautiful sleds Bernie. And great old photos.
546699,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2011-02-02 02:57:00,0,this could turn into one of the coolest threads i've ever seen on OFC.  keep posting the vintage sleds if you got'em!
546708,Old Man,2011-02-02 03:08:00,822, I've got tons. Here are just a few.     
546713,Pigeontroller,2011-02-02 03:09:00,2793,"Here's a oldie, spent a few nights driving my cousins around when I was a teenager, it was the coolest looking thing I thought at the time...  "
546717,trapshooter,2011-02-02 03:12:00,1234,"Bernie, your old pictures are priceless!!  Thanks for posting."
546718,Old Man,2011-02-02 03:13:00,822, Late 70s (77 or 78) Deere 440 Cyclone. Nice sled.
546721,Nipfisher,2011-02-02 03:20:00,2449,The first sled I drove as a kid. 1980 ET340. I was probaly about 8 years old and couldn't handle it wide open. Was such a light sled.  Not my picture. Stole it off the net.
546727,The Urban Fisherman,2011-02-02 03:27:00,2050,"Not all that vintage but the sled I've wanted since I was a kid is a late 80's to early 90' phazer!!!!  Maybe next year!    Cheers, Ryan"
546729,Nipfisher,2011-02-02 03:29:00,2449,Beautiful pictures on these 2 sites.  http://www.mwvss.com/gallery/2004/index.php  http://www.oldrupps.com/SnowmobileShows/Kasson/Kasson06.html
546758,Rod Caster,2011-02-02 04:04:00,5784," Chrome belly pan shows every dent. I don't think we'll ever see chrome belly pans again. Talk about low center of gravity, Yamaha figured it out years ago!"
546775,bigugli,2011-02-02 04:48:00,6138,Steered like a tank on a packed surface. Lean over til your helmet almost touches ground if you wanted to make a tight turn. They were near indestructible
546786,Jonny,2011-02-02 05:44:00,1380,"A few pictures...  The Ski-Doo is an Olympique (I think it was 18 HP). Very ""tippy"" until I eventually put extension plates on the ski pivots.  The lead machine in the multiple sled picture is an old single-ski Snow Bug (made in Sudbury).    "
546791,Handlebarz,2011-02-02 09:16:00,3790,"Hey Ryan I had that same Phazer II back when it was just out what a great sled a buddy had the other model which was reverse paint we switched side covers and she sure did look wicked all white. One of the best pasts about this sled was she NEVER got stuck I was always the one to break new trails one of the best sleds I have owned.  I also loved my 650 INDY but she was not any good in very deep snow if you stopped it was fun to try and get going again but she was great for trail ridding and also lake racing which we did daily in Sudbury, all kids of people would show up to moonlight beach on Lake Ramsey in Sudbury and race out to the first island all day no rules just great times.  I like the look`s of some of the old girls but would never want my elan or olimpic back."
