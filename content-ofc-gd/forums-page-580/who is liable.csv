546731,chessy,2011-02-02 03:30:00,610,just wondering if someone hits your hut in the dark seeing you placed it there are you liable for placing something on crown land . Now if you put markers on it with even a solar light are you still responsible??
546733,irishfield,2011-02-02 03:35:00,26272,"Catch 22 eh... you mark it clearly.. then you know it's a hazard. You don't mark it....  It's like putting up a sign.. ""beware of dog"".. makes you liable as you know it's dangerous. Where'as ""Guard dog on duty"" does not!"

546808,Fisherman,2011-02-02 12:28:00,7201,"If I'm reading this correctly, I'm betting you are wondering if nimblenuts is going warp drive on a snowmobile at night and at the last second crashes into an ice hut that was beyond the light and his reaction time. Too bad, so sad, for him, unfortunate loss for the hut owner.  If you're anticipating this, I'd make the walls out of 4x4 (oak), it hurts more."

546847,skeeter,2011-02-02 14:09:00,1907,"I would think that since the hut was not moving, the sled driver would be liable for all damages."
546905,bigugli,2011-02-02 15:50:00,6138,You can ask a dozen different lawyers and get a dozen different answers. All depends on how mush you want to spend on fees.
546979,uglyfish,2011-02-02 17:58:00,981,I would think its the sledder that is liable. Not really any different then having a car parked on the street and another motorist hitting it. U have to be aware of ur surroundings and in complete control at all times when operating any motor vehicle. How is him hitting ur hut that u placed on the ice any different then him running through u sitting beside a hole fishing with no hut there? Are u liable for his carelessness because u were standing on the ice?
546997,fishing n autograph,2011-02-02 18:33:00,2540,"I'm not sure and have never come across this, but since the sled is a motor vehicle, I'd say the driver is responsible. I mean if a guy is flying around and hits a buried utility box and hits it, then he's responsible...I think the same thing goes. If anyone wants a real answer I can ask a buddy of mine in the marine unit who works most winter days on simcoe"
547296,blue pickeral,2011-02-03 13:42:00,267,"Would just parallel the scenario - ""What if it had been a large rock that was hit?"""
547301,Harrison,2011-02-03 13:58:00,2202,"I don't see how you would be chessy.  Same I would assume for folks that have permanent docks.  My huts are covered in reflecting tape, there is really not much more you can do."
547374,Billy Bob,2011-02-03 18:14:00,5865,What if said driver hit a tree on Crown Land.....driver would be responsible either way I would think...
547393,BillM,2011-02-03 19:34:00,17367,It's not like the hut jumped out and smashed into the snowmobile.  Driver is at fault.
