547900,Gerritt,2011-02-05 00:37:00,6129,"Finally got an answer from the MOL.   The Occupational Health and Safety Act (OHS Act) requires an employer to take every precaution reasonable in the circumstances for the protection of any worker, whether it be through policies, training, enforcement and/or supervision.    This means that an employer is responsible to ensure the safety of employees when they drive as part of their work duties, even if the employee is using his or her own vehicle. The employer must make employees aware of the hazards related to driving, and provide information, instruction and supervision to protect the health and safety of the employees. An employer has an obligation to have a Road Safety Program and develop policies and procedures on driver licensing requirements, safe driving practices (including when it is safe to be on the roads), vehicle maintenance, and collision/injury investigations.    A worker can refuse to work if he or she has reason to believe that one or more of the following is true:    - Any machine, equipment or tool that the worker is using or is told to use is likely to endanger himself or herself or another worker [section 43(3)(a)].    - The physical condition of the workplace or workstation is likely to endanger the worker [section 43(3)(].    - Any machine, equipment or tool that the worker is using, or the physical condition of the workplace, contravenes the Act or regulations and is likely to endanger himself or herself or another worker [section 43(3)©].    In order for the legislation to apply; for the worker to have the right to refuse, they must be working (getting paid) at the time they feel they may be endangered in order to be able to exercise their rights.    In other situations this issue may be covered under a collective agreement with the employer, or an employee may wish to contact legal counsel to determine their rights under other legislation.    The actual legal requirements for a work refusal are outlined in Part V of the OHS Act:    http://www.e-laws.gov.on.ca/html/statutes/english/elaws_statutes_90o01_e.htm#BK45    A plain-language guide to this can be found here:    http://www.labour.gov.on.ca/english/hs/pubs/ohsa/ohsag_7.php    For external assistance in the development of occupational health and safety policies and programs, you may contact the appropriate workplace safety association:    http://www.healthandsafetyontario.ca/    The Ministry of Transportation provides Winter Road Conditions Reports that are made available during the winter months from the end of October to April each year. It is very important to view the Description of Road Conditions and Visibility to better understand the terms used in the reports. Enjoy a safe trip.

I've currently got N/E winds at 25 knots gusting to 36. Reduced vis in blowing snow..  Going outside for a smoke break is an ordeal.  In all probability I'll be here for a while. Supposed to get off at 6am tomorrow morning, but I can't leave 'till my relief shows up and he drives a '92 Caravan with pieces of baloney instead of actual tires.

546681,Bernie,2011-02-02 02:30:00,3190, It does close to 90 k on tires and on tracks on hard surface about 75. Works pretty good. I'm impressed so far. Still not a sled though.
546683,irishfield,2011-02-02 02:33:00,26272,Yah.. but a tad more versitility for some areas. Overall width still 4'... that it would fit sled trails on portages?
546690,Bernie,2011-02-02 02:46:00,3190,"Hmmm, not sure how wide it is? Didn't measure it. I'd say more than 4. The tracks stick out at least 4 inches more than the tires on the front to allow steering clearance.  I wouldn't use it on the trails anyway, I'd just use a sled. I use this for a workhorse."
546693,Gerritt,2011-02-02 02:50:00,6129,Still allows clearance for the plow B?

I grew up in London, snow is mainly just an inconvenience for me! I love driving in it, heck, I even like shovelling the stuff as it is a time I get to share with my neighbours as we all clean up. My main reason for ""planning"" to stay home is the fact that I take the Go Train to work and well, they don't actually have the best record of service during any snow, much less what they are calling for here tomorrow. So, I'll likely be home Wednesday, good time to get some things done and enjoy the peacefulness that an empty house brings. HH"
546435,moxie,2011-02-01 20:26:00,1566,"I'm probably going to be seen as a bit of an ass but here goes. I, as many others, can appreciate how far we've come with health and safety in many aspect of our lives. But really now. When my parents and hoards of immigrants came to Canada in the 50s and 60s they had to Shelter, feed and clothe themselves and their brood and to do that they endured many a storm, hardship and even heartache of many kinds but still managed to get the job done. Because they had to. Danger is Danger and it varies in Degrees whether factual or as a product of convenience whether you stand on the side of the Employer or the Employee. Another matter is how the sentiment has changed towards Employers both Big and Small as well as our ""Take care of ""#1"" view that has become more prevalent over the years. If we choose not to take on a task because of perils that are obvious or otherwise it is our right to do so. But we must remember that an Employer has invested and risked to follow Endeavours and goals of their own and it is also their right to refuse to hire or maintain an individual based on the Dangers and risks associated with them. Its a means to an end for both sides and rather unfortunate that what should have grown into a limited but viable partnership over the last few Decades has degenerated to become a nest of confrontation. Just my 2 cents."

546190,LeXXington,2011-02-01 03:06:00,1928,If upon inspection a MTO / OPP officer deemed the tires do not meet the requirement for road worthy.. There is no snow tire requirement. Depending on the tires there should be a marker where they need replacing The MTO or OPP states the vehicle is not road worthy  or  If the OPP / MTO closed the roads due to unsafe conditions.  Other than that a refusal to work would be grounds for termination.  Make the personal choice to not go / not go and deal with the fall out.

546196,danc,2011-02-01 03:14:00,4677, I wouldn't and haven't done either. I was just stating a few facts. Have a looky at my profile and see where I live and work. On Wednesday I'll be driving over 350 miles to go to my job on roads that you probably have never or will ever drive on. I spent a grand today on tires just to get me there. Your turn.
546197,solopaddler,2011-02-01 03:17:00,8605,"Depends on where you live. In this area you take your life in your hands when you get behind the wheel after a major dump of snow.  You're at the mercy of every reckless idiot who doesn't know how to drive.  We had a minor dump recently, nothing major, but the roads were snow covered.  It was 7am and I think to myself, perfect time to head over to Home Depot and brouse around, there won't be a soul on the road.  I put the truck in 4 wheel, sip my coffee, and leisurely drive over to the store. Totally enjoying the snow covered roads and blowing snow.  I get to the main road where the entrance to HD is. There's one vehicle in front of me also turning left to go in.  I'm keeping my distance leaving about 2 car lengths between us.  Just as both of us are about to start turning left on an advanced green I see a red Honda approaching rapidly in the right lane, doing at least 80km.  I figured he was going to blast right through the intersection but when he came abreast of me he put his left indicator on, swung wide, and tried to squeeze in front of me right in the middle of the intersection.  I laid on the horn and was afraid to brake and start sliding all over the place.  I would've absolutely hit him if he had pulled off his stupid manouver.  He swings even wider, his back end fishtailing all over the place and pulls in behind me.  It was like a scene out of Dukes Of Hazzard  I'm trying to stay calm but it's hard since he's flashing his lights at me non stop and blaring his horn inches from my rear bumper.  My blood pressure rose even higher when he followed me into the empty Home Depot parking lot, pulled in right behind me and jumped out of his car.  He looked to be 19 or 20 to me, driving one of those uber gay souped up Honda Civics.  There's more to the story but I'll end it here.  I HATE driving here when there's snow on the roads."

I do not want them to travel in such conditions  I will consider my options when I see what happens during the evening; no fun driving to King and Dufferin from Klienburg.

546218,sconceptor,2011-02-01 04:04:00,146,"The employee can call in sick(stress), or be honest and say they don't feel comfortable, which, I wouldn't think the employer wouldn't have to pay the employee, unless roads are actually closed.  So it's either a sick day, a day without pay or different job duty, a vacation day, or take the risks(any accident is covered by the employers insurance though).  My company is good. Living up here in Bruce County, each year staff gets stuck at work for 2-3days.  Everybody gets double time after their first shift is over, untill they leave.  If we are on company business, and roads are closed up in B.C. We are allowed to book hotels and have meals on the company in a safer area till it clears up.  If roads are just bad, and we don't want to come to work, it's either banked time or vacation time.  If we're late 2hours due to weather we don't have to make up the time.  Driving a new truck, it's not worth the risk to get caught up in accidents and have to deal with insurance.  Also, getting stuck on some closed road since you weren't listening to the radio, and risking fines or no insurance in an accident, is not worth it.  If getting somewhere can be delayed, it's not worth the risk, so hotels, or cancelling plans is the best bet!"

Combine that with the blowing wind and white out conditions and you have a recipe for disaster.  I love driving in snowstorms. I like thunderstorms and all natures acts of irregularity.  Our jobsite is shut down until thursday and I can not wait to bomb around in the snow.  I do not live in the city though.  I would hate the idea of slogging my arse into the city with all those other yahoos on the road that can't drive in good weather let alone bad.  And yes, if my boss told me to dart about the city in a snow storm in a 2 wheel drive truck with no snow tires, I would decline."

546362,fish_fishburn,2011-02-01 17:47:00,1311,"We live in Canada, get used to it.  Sounds like a bunch of Americans that get a snow storm once every few years. For them I can understand their uncertianty.  The news makes everything sound worse then it usually is, including the weather. Drama get's our attention I guess.  Make your own decision, and plan your day accordingly. Give yourself extra time to get to your destinations and carry on, life goes on in the Great White North. In a few months we will be advised to stay indoors because it's to hot out."
546069,Gerritt,2011-01-31 22:07:00,6129,"With the upcoming snow storm I have a quick question in regards to Health and Safety Laws...  A good friend called me up asking if his employer can force him to drive a company vehicle in inclimate weather, especially if the vehicle does not have proper equipment.. ie. Snow Tires etc..  I know in the OHSA there is a clause for refusal to work... but does this apply in this situation? and if it does is there any law pertaining to weather specifically?  I have searched the MOL with no answers, I have also emailed without reply..  So I was wondering if you guys knew anything.  G"
546070,HTHM,2011-01-31 22:14:00,4082,"As I understand it, under the act, if a worker FEELS that the work is unsafe, he has the right to call in an inspector to make a judgement. He better have his butt covered for when the inspector leaves though.... Yes the act would apply here as well, driving is part of the job at hand."
546071,bigugli,2011-01-31 22:15:00,6138,It is a grey area.  There are exceptions if you work for an essential service. You have to be able to clearly define how the work vehicle was unsafe for the weather conditions. Snow tires are not mandatory in Ontario so that is not sufficient grounds.  An easy out is if the police or MTO issue an advisory to stay off the roads.

Better question is ...why would an employer want to put his equipment/employee at unnessasary risk of being damaged or lost...  Hope it helps..."

546076,Gerritt,2011-01-31 22:25:00,6129,  I suppose for the all mighty dollar?  I am not really too sure... my buddy is not hired as a fulltime driver.. but some driving is needed as part of his job... I figured he could refuse work if he felt unsafe.. however there are unsaid repercussions to this... as we all know. It seems to be a grey area and that is why I thought I would ask.  I k now of a few situations where I refused to work...ie. Trenches without shoring  But driving is a different animal all together.  thanks guys
546080,Twocoda,2011-01-31 22:32:00,4130,if its a question of snow tires...although its an inconvenience to put on ....they are alot cheaper then a compansation claim....if the employeee in question is truly concerned for his safety ...then all he has to do is call in sick...he wont be lying

546127,spincast,2011-02-01 00:43:00,3279,"It is unfortunate that such situations occur - but over the years I have made the call many times both ways. I remember at one trucking firm in a snow storm I arrived in the yard and all the drivers were freaking out becuase of the weather reports. Now these guys are all pros with A licenses. A couple said "" I can't even get my truck to move from the parking spot"". Yes there was snow - quite a few inches, but the hype was worse than the reality and they had all driven in worse. I had driven in from out of town and they all lived locally. I explained that really, the roads weren't that bad.  Plows and salters had been out - in town and the parking lot were worse than the roads out of town. I said - If I can move that truck - dressed in my office clothes, and hook to your trailer, are you willing to go out and try? If you feel unsafe at anytime once you're on the road, just tell me and we'll  let you pull over and or come back"". They all agreed. I hopped in, diff lock on, put it in 5th and with a couple quick pops of the clutch and a rock or two - hey presto - line up the pin, hook and we're golden. They all went out. No-one  got in an accident, no one turned around, no one pulled over. On the other hand, many is the time I have had guys call me and say they have freezing rain and or blizzards and don't feel safe continuing. Shut down - because once your confidence is gone, you are too much at risk. You aren't focusing on what you need to be.  All that being said - your friend needs to assess the situation when faced with it. He maybe able to go out, or he may not. Look to the MTO road closures and delays (website) before departing, heck - even see if where he is being sent is going to be open, because if it is really bad many companies will send staff home rather than have them stranded.  Your friend is able to make the decision himself without any repercussions or sanctions if he feels the work he is being requested to do is unsafe above the normal job requirements -  if his job description calls for him to drive the vehicle he is assigned to and he is qualified to do so. If it isn;t part of his regular job description then he has a lot more littitude in what represents a hazard. But as Art mentioned;  depending on how this is handled the actions may have some undesirable results in the longer term. And no job is worth harming yourself or others....   "

A foot of snow is nothing, driving in it isn't a problem, just take your time and be careful.  If I refused to work because of a snow storm, my co workers would laugh thier asses off at me. I'd be quite embarrassed even thinking of calling in.  What has this world come to. Its Canada for god sakes, we're supposed to like cold and snow. What a bunch of wussies!!!

Seems like anything is an excuse to get the easy way out nowadays. I wasn't brought up that way, and my kids won't be either.
