547274,misfish,2011-02-03 10:15:00,29133,Could just be an O ring .Give Bigcliff a pm. Im sure he can help ya out.
547275,Big Cliff,2011-02-03 10:33:00,6899," The item on the left is just a drain valve, it could be leaking because the seal is gone or because there is a bit of dirt in it. Either way, it is an easy fix.  The other one is your fuel adjustment. Don't turn the screw but you can undo the nut and the whole jet will come out as one piece. I would pull the bowl off and check to see if there is any dirt in there, if so give the carb a good cleaning. Getting a carb kit might not be a bad idea, you might need a new bowl gasket anyway depending on how old yours is. If you have any problems, let me know, I can walk you through it.  Where are you located? If you are anywhere near Lindsay bring it over I'll do it for you."
