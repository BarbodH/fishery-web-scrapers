546895,cuzza,2011-02-02 15:33:00,467," I was wondering the same thing - 25GB is a LOT of data, unless you're on torrent sites morning noon and night (in which case you should get out more) I can't see how people can need such huge limits - who, as a private customer needs 300GB?  I stream 4 or 5 rugby matches a month plus some football (soccer) games and never get over 10 of my 20GB quota. If you really need to access the internet that much then you should be paying more."
546907,cram,2011-02-02 15:52:00,1733," There are services like Netflix which are legitimate paid-for streaming TV and movies.  Apple recently launched a TV service as well.  Good alternative to renting movies through Rogers, Bell, or Blockbuster.  Netflix HD movies stream at about 1.5-2 gigs per hr (i think).  So, what Bell and Rogers are really doing is pushing out content competition.  This is not about infrastructure costs."
546916,Jonny,2011-02-02 16:03:00,1380," You're entitled to your opinion, and if your usage is low that's fine, but I wonder why you care so much about what other people use the internet for?  The ""problem"" isn't one of capacity. The problem is the big telecoms finding another way to vacuum money out of people's pockets.  Be aware that it may not be your problem but it is a problem for others.  I've written to both my local MP and to the federal government to ask them to reverse the CRTC decision.     "

EDIT --- There's one thing that really shows the greed of the big carriers : It costs them about a penny to transmit a gig of data, yet they want to charge people over a dollar per gig when they go over the new ""cap"".  That's not a justifiable profit, that's a ""Pay through the nose, Sucka"" obscene rip-off.   "

546372,Old Man,2011-02-01 18:14:00,822," A study done a couple of years ago showed that out of all the G20 countries, Canada had the most expensive and worst telecommunication services.

By enabling Bell and Rogers to cap our use, they are in effect enabling them to monopolize the content-delivery business as well."

546500,Big Cliff,2011-02-01 22:06:00,6899,"I just talked to Xplornet the other day and they told me there is a new ""Fair Use Policy"" coming into effect and that I would be getting a letter about it. Seems they are blaming it on CRTC. You won't pay extra but they will reduce your upload/download speed if you go over your limit.  This is from their site. Hope you can read all of this, it is the best I could do.;  Fixed Wireless    There are different Fair Access Policies that apply to our regular and enhanced services.   These two policies are below.  Please reference the policy that applies to your specific service.  If you are on our regular fixed-wireless service:  Our goal is to ensure that each Xplornet customer receives fair and consistent access to the Internet. A small percentage of customers are responsible for a disproportionate share of data usage on our network. To minimize the impact that heavier users might have on the experience of other Xplornet customers, we have implemented a Fair Access Policy. Our intent with this policy is to affect the fewest customers while helping maintain the best speeds for the majority of customers.  The Fair Access Policy on your service operates only during peak hours (between 8am and 1am local time). During this time, we subject traffic related to applications that are considered non time-sensitive (such as peer-to-peer file sharing, news groups, and online data storage) to a peak transfer speed of 300kbps download and 100kbps upload.  Outside of the Fair Access Policy, the speed you experience on your service is influenced by the design of the equipment. The equipment on your service is designed so that the speed you experience varies on a “per transaction” basis. Each time you begin a new “usage transaction”, such as clicking a link on the web, sending an e-mail, or uploading a file, the initial speed you experience will be the “burst” speed associated with your particular package.  You will continue to experience this burst speed until you reach the “burst limit” for your package. If the transaction isn’t finished when you reach the burst limit, the transaction will be completed at the “Sustained” speed for your package. (Click here for an example).  Each new usage transaction begins with the burst rate.  During normal web browsing, you will likely find that your transactions are at the burst rate. With larger file downloads/uploads, your transactions will be at a mix of the burst and sustained rates.  The table below illustrates the burst speed, burst limits, and sustained speed on each package.  Service Package Burst Speed Burst Limit Sustained Speed Zip Down Up to 300 kbps 36 KB Up to 100 Kbps Up Up to 100 kbps 12 KB Up to 50 Kbps Zoom Down Up to 1.5 Mbps 1.5 MB Up to 600 Kbps Up Up to 500 kbps 600 KB Up to 150 Kbps Xpress Down Up to 3.0 Mbps 3.5 MB Up to 700 Kbps Up Up to 600 kbps 600 KB Up to 300 Kbps Xtreme Down Up to 5.0 Mbps 6.0 MB Up to 900 Kbps Up Up to 800 kbps 6.0 MB Up to 600 Kbps Small Biz Down Up to 3.0 Mbps 3.5 MB Up to 800 Kbps Up Up to 600 kbps 600 KB Up to 800 Kbps Medium Biz Down Up to 5.0 Mbps 6.0 MB Up to 1.0 Mbps Up Up to 800 kbps 6.0 MB Up to 750 Kbps Big Biz Down Up to 5.0 Mbps 6.0 MB Up to 1.0 Mbps Up Up to 1.2 Mbps 6.0 MB Up to 1.0 Mbps  *Note: The listed packages are Xplornet’s standard offers. Depending upon your region, your package may have a different name. However, your equipment will be consistent with the service packages of the same speed configurations above."
546553,cram,2011-02-01 23:04:00,1733, No one is stopping them from charging more for their services.    Its that they are making it mandatory for EVERYONE to cap it.  It also has little to do with infrastructure costs and everything to do with loss of content delivery revenue.  In many ways this will slow innovation (or the adoption of innovation) here.
