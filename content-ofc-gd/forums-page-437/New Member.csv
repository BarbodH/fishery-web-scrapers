Most of the time I practice catch and release, except when it comes to pike in the Kawarthas. I tie my own bucktails and spinnerbaits to cut down on the cost of fishing, especially with muskie gear. Hopefully this year I'll be able to afford a gas motor for my 12' aluminum although my 74lb. trolling motor has been pushing me around all right. Here's a few pictures from last year in the Kawarthas.   "
