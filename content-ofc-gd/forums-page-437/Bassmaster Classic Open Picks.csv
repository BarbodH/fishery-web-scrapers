Water is still colder then normal so I have a feeling it will play out alot like last yeaars classic with guys trying to stay on a spot all day where active fish move by. Crankbaits to get the larger fish to bite. Its all aboout fishing first not second!  That is my strategy, I wonder if I will be close!!LOL   Darren"
669286,Roy,2012-02-23 23:13:00,13728,I think your strategy should be to look after your own team in the tourney.
669308,spinnerbaitking,2012-02-24 00:18:00,1622,"KVD also, lots of talk about Edwin Evers & Ott Defoe though   "
669320,bucktail,2012-02-24 00:38:00,1857,I am sneaking KVD on too my team shhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
669350,Dan668,2012-02-24 01:30:00,1120,Kvd
669419,cl_fishin,2012-02-24 04:13:00,138,Aaron Martens
669629,HTHM,2012-02-24 20:38:00,4082,The guy with the most big fish.
669648,capt bruce,2012-02-24 21:21:00,820,"Aaron is one of my favorites. I hope he wins , but KVD is just so good , its a river , anyones guess .. GO AaRon go ... Shaw Grigsby is my ALL TIME fav .. If you get a chance read his book , great fisherman great family man ,just a person you should pattern your life after , after reading his book had a great influence on my life as a pro fishermen , but he is not a river guy !!! Sorry Shaw not your year ..."
