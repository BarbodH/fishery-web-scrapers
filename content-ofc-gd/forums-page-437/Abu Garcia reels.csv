669061,walleye wanderer,2012-02-23 03:13:00,64," Hey Darren, I would love to grab one or two of those, I have an older 5500 and in my quest to find some info on it I stumbled onto a great tutorial for the 6600 mag, hope it helps. 6600 C5 tutorial "
669066,bucktail,2012-02-23 03:32:00,1857,thanks walleye! I think I'll try to get them  I'll tell you how I do   darren
669080,Roy,2012-02-23 11:16:00,13728,"Good find Bucktail. The 6600 C5 Mag x is the best Abu reel I own. I don't know how much they are but if they are in decent condition, snap them up."
669083,lew,2012-02-23 11:41:00,12766,I used to have a couple C-5s and their a pretty decent reel for the price.
669084,Roy,2012-02-23 11:43:00,13728,"Ha! And Lew, that purchase was another ""Lew"" recommendation which I again thank you for."
669086,lew,2012-02-23 11:47:00,12766,Good to hear somebody listens to me Roy
669095,mercman,2012-02-23 12:47:00,7054," I pick your brain every time you post Lew And i bet you never feel a thing  Just got a St Croix Premier Musky rod, and waiting to find a deal on a Calcutta."
669329,Snidley,2012-02-24 01:00:00,620,Think Daiwa Luna or Millionaire CVZ as much superior to a  regular Calcutta (the spool is much better especially for big fish like Musky). On the other hands a Calcutta TE is the best there is in a Musky reel. I never thought much of round Abu's myself.
669430,RSF,2012-02-24 05:25:00,47,"Once used an Abu Garcia reel, that was so long ago they came in a plastic and carboard stretch wrap thing with a a rod. Used it for a couple of years then gave it to my Son. Cheap and well made. For the last 25 yrs, I have been using the same two reels, Daiwa SGA1355 SR and a Penn 209 for large game fish."
