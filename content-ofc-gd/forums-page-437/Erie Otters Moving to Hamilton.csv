669702,pikehunters,2012-02-24 23:53:00,40,Just on the news the buzz is that The Erie Otters may be making a move to Hamilton. Any news on your end??
669704,Grimace,2012-02-24 23:55:00,2020,Great news for Hamilton but what a shame.  Erie is one of the loudest buildings in the league.  I had not heard anything about it.
669724,Garfisher,2012-02-25 00:55:00,229,"They should move Mississauga there instead, almost no one there seems to care for them (for example, last year I was able to buy a ticket for the semi's of the Memorial Cup a couple hours before puck drop)."
669749,Frank,2012-02-25 02:43:00,74,"Sucks for the fans of Erie, and if this does happen I hope the residents of the Steel City will support them, considering the fact that if they do move to Hamilton, this will be the 6th time the same franchise will be in the Hamilton.  Franchise history 1946–53	Windsor Spitfires 1953–60	Hamilton Tiger Cubs 1960–74	Hamilton Red Wings 1974–76	Hamilton Fincups 1976–77	St. Catharines Fincups 1977–78	Hamilton Fincups 1978–84	Brantford Alexanders 1984–88	Hamilton Steelhawks 1988–96	Niagara Falls Thunder 1996–present	Erie Otters"
669791,Woodsman,2012-02-25 10:36:00,1286,One could argue that 53-76 would only be one time with 2 name changes.
669797,pikehunters,2012-02-25 11:59:00,40," Here is the link on the news last night. Should have posted originally but I made a stupid move & listend to the weather man. 6""-8"" of snow overnight 3"" - 5"" on Sat. So i got the truck & plow already to go anticipating a 20 hr push. Woke up this morning to green grass.  http://yourerie.com/...t?nxd_id=218542"

669898,esoxansteel,2012-02-25 21:46:00,1307,"Shucks i read it to quickly, i thought it said Erie Outfitters"
669901,Frank,2012-02-25 21:57:00,74," Correct, I should of said 4th time in Hamilton since they stayed in the Hammer through those years.  I LOVE having the Niagara IceDogs in St. Catharines and if Hamilton does get an OHL team I would gladly go to a bunch of games every year like I do for the AHL Bulldogs, mind you it would be nice to keep the Bulldogs in Hamilton also, sadly the attendance just isn't there."
669925,express168,2012-02-26 01:00:00,327,"The Bulldog situation should be interesting to watch, their lease at Copps expires at the end of the 2012-2013 season and so does their affiliation agreement with Montreal. Same thing happened when the Oilers decided to move the original Bulldogs franchise( formerly Cape Breton) to Toronto as the Roadrunners in 2002 and the Quebec Citadelles were brought in to Hamilton to carry on as the Bulldogs as the Montreal affiliate. That was the one season when the Bulldogs played as a combo affiliate for the Habs and Oilers in 2002 and in 2003  they became the Habs affilaite alone.I hope the Bulldogs hang around but can't blame them if they move, we have seen plenty of teams come and go here. Remember the other AHL team the Hamilton Canucks and or last OHL team The Dukes of Hamilton, I sure did like the Steelhawks when they were around though."
