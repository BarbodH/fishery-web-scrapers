669258,tb4me,2012-02-23 21:53:00,3295,"Man Nascar sure has these cars messed up, dont they. If they cant go 60 laps without destroying the motors in the cars imagine what 500 miles will do to them...Good thing Nascar is allowing motor swaps between now and sunday without punnishment...lol  Way to go Kenseth...a good ol atta boy to you!"

669421,spud7378,2012-02-24 04:26:00,68,"the new aro package sucks, one little tap and bye bye, i think nascars goal of making the cars safer is going backwards again? the 500 should be full of lots of wrecked racecars! i think its going to come down to staying on the lead lap, stay out of trouble and sit and wait!"
669559,DRIFTER_016,2012-02-24 17:35:00,10439, The aero pkg. was changed to get rid of the 2 car draft of the last couple of years as it made the race pretty boring to watch. NASCAR want's exciting competitive racing for the fans as well as safety for the drivers. Every year they make small cahnges to the pkg. some things work some don't. I think you will see changes to the spoiler and or rear springs again next year to plant the rear of the cars but don't be surprised if they change something else to retain the pack draft and get rid of the 2 car draft.
669614,misfish,2012-02-24 19:56:00,29133,How about that Waltrip blunder?   Is he NEW?
669615,DRIFTER_016,2012-02-24 19:58:00,10439, Lost too many brain cells from sucking Earnhart Sr's exhaust for too many years.
