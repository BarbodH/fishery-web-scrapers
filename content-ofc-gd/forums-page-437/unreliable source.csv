669893,misfish,2012-02-25 21:30:00,29133,Good ole mom.
669904,kickingfrog,2012-02-25 22:21:00,8333,"I don't have a clue, but the staff would be the last to know."
669911,woodenboater,2012-02-25 22:59:00,2277,"  Yup, often is the case. Hope not for the sake of the employees, well maybe except for a few who couldn't be bothered, but most in the fishing dept were pretty decent.  "
669914,otter649,2012-02-25 23:28:00,118,Not a BPS or Cabelos store but Outdoor Journal Radio Show (Fan590) mentioned a few weeks ago a Sail Store is coming to Burlington in Spring 2012 as well as another store set to go somewhere in The GTA - Four new stores in less than a year appears to be abit much but the market will decide.....
669920,pikehunter,2012-02-26 00:37:00,1659, Ya! What's up with that eh? So much talk not too long ago about BPS coming to the waterfront and then nothing
669420,spud7378,2012-02-24 04:23:00,68,I heard that they are thinking of adding a second ontario store in sudbury?
669426,Lunatic,2012-02-24 05:06:00,536,thats me. i have 3 and im waiting for the spring sale.that place is not allowed to leave.i can think of one or 2 local places that can tho
669436,misfish,2012-02-24 09:41:00,29133, YEP Coming to Barrie. Lets start that rumor again.LMAO
669439,Billy Bob,2012-02-24 10:42:00,5865,"BPS is a checkout girl when it comes to just about anything.....  Here in Buffalo they promised to build a store on the waterfront for NINE YEARS....the city knocked down the old Aud to make room for them......and all the city got in return was more and more and more promises and design photos of what it was going to look like when finished from BPS....BPS kept trying to milk MORE and MORE public tax dollars from the state, county and City of Buffalo....over 127 MILLION dollars was promised to BPS but they never did sign on the dotted line....to me that's a lot of public dollars to build a bait shop...  BPS is known to do this all around the country with different states and cities.......it could be possible that they are working the Providence of Ontario for tax shelters or even free tax money to stay open....it would not surprise me.  Now for those who wish they had a Gander Mountain....better known as Expensive Mountain around here.....watch what you wish for.....they are the WORST I have ever seen.....the store is quite big but nowhere as big as a BPS or Cabela's.....but they don't have any employees working there to speak of......they don't even keep 1 cash register open now....if you want to cash out you have to go to the customer service desk where the 2 out of maybe 4 employees are in the whole store....it's a real joke in there....drug stores have more people working in them then our Gander Mountain Store.  Cabela's would be a great assets but I hope they NEVER come to NYS....then I would have to pay sales tax on everything I purchase from them and that's at 8.75% right now....they always have free shipping or some other kind of deal so I don't pay for shipping and their BARGAIN CAVE is to die for.... ....and Cabela's customer service is second to none.   Bob"
669440,fishindevil,2012-02-24 11:21:00,6254,"bring a cabelas to ontario !!!! and BPS ,would be taking a backseat for sure...."
669448,Bondy,2012-02-24 12:50:00,40,Cabela's is great....for clothes.
669453,Rod Caster,2012-02-24 13:06:00,5784," Even the Canadian Bargain Cave is a real gem! Unfortunately they have fewer items in the Canadian Cabelas Online. For example, I can't get Saskatchewan boots inserts here grrr.  Between cabelas.ca and wholesale sports, which is the BEST online store, I wouldn't be sad to see BPS go ""poof"", although it seems unlikely."
669462,Lip-ripper,2012-02-24 13:42:00,228,I was at BPS and LeBarons last weekend. I picked up a spool of steel trolling line at LeBaron's for $20. Same thing at BPS was $30. I was actually surprised to see that. If it did close... meh... I like LeBarons better anyways. Would suck for Vaughan to lose those jobs though.
669465,Bondy,2012-02-24 13:49:00,40,Where has BPS closed one? This isn't 'Halloween Headquarters' where they open a store front for 2 weeks. BPS is a strong company especially in that location. I am a vendor to them.
669467,BillM,2012-02-24 13:53:00,17367,"Why would anyone build a store in Buffalo, lol.   I don't blame BPS at all.   Also Gander Mountain isn't bad at all, everytime I'm in there the employees are more then helpful."
669473,bare foot wader,2012-02-24 14:01:00,1354,"I've only been to the cabelas in edmonton....nothing but a massive disappointment...everything from clothing, fishing, lure selection, guns and customer service was horrible....the PRICES were insane....the st. croix premier ice rods are usualy 20-25 bucks, 36.99 for a 24' ML   lebaron should expand with bigger stores and better customer service..."
669474,Billy Bob,2012-02-24 14:04:00,5865, Canada doesn't have a monopoly on incompetent elected officials.
669476,blaque,2012-02-24 14:07:00,2419, So canadians can come down and x-mas shop?
669480,BillM,2012-02-24 14:10:00,17367,"  In downtown Buffalo? Have you been there recently?  It's hardly a place any business is going to set up shop, unless you're selling crack."
669503,pikehunter,2012-02-24 15:04:00,1659," Have to agree with ya there Dave, and that's from one who works for the yanks.  If BPS closes up the mall can contact this outfit for a replacement "
669509,hirk,2012-02-24 15:16:00,571,"The bps here according to gossip is in the top 3 in sales among ALL bps locations, chances of it closing are between zero and something less than that."
669525,Billy Bob,2012-02-24 16:15:00,5865," I believe the people in the Buffalo area are upset of losing 9 years while negotiating with BPS and even now another year has passed and nothing is being done there or anywhere else on the waterfront because BPS held thing up. Had BPS not signed a ""letter of intent"" to build there, there might well be something there now as a great opportunity was lost during some of the BEST economy times during all these negotiations with BPS.  It would be like me saying I going to buy your house and I keep putting it off until the real estate market crashes and then say GOODBYE to you."
669538,blaque,2012-02-24 16:58:00,2419, Ill be down there tonite for the Boston/Buffalo game.....I dont expect to see anything being sold on the streets other than hockey tickets
669539,blaque,2012-02-24 17:01:00,2419,Wouldnt have to go too far west to find the crack however......You should visit a little section called the Fruit Belt when your down next time Bill lmao. Billy Bob can probably attest
669541,BillM,2012-02-24 17:01:00,17367, PLEASE BE CAREFUL!!!!   LOL!!!!
669542,blaque,2012-02-24 17:06:00,2419, lol.........always
669637,jimmer,2012-02-24 21:02:00,2730,Our Provincial Government is broke!
669642,bramptonjerry,2012-02-24 21:11:00,132,"yeah I was thinking that myself, maybe we threatened to take some secret tax dollars off the table or something like that"
669643,Billy Bob,2012-02-24 21:14:00,5865, Welcome to the CLUB.....and another tax increase in the near future...
669874,Joey,2012-02-25 20:29:00,9122,Well my mom was at Vaughan Mills Mall today and I told her about this thread.  She asked them if the rumours were true and they said absolutely not!!!!  Store is not closing.
669324,bramptonjerry,2012-02-24 00:50:00,132,just heard from very unreliable source (my wife) that BPS might be closing...if anyone would know you folks would?
669326,skeeter,2012-02-24 00:52:00,1907,Did your wife say where she heard this?
669327,bramptonjerry,2012-02-24 00:58:00,132,a friend of hers from work brought it up today
669328,workwear,2012-02-24 01:00:00,592,please say it isnt sooo....not my candy store...noooooooooooooooooooooo
669330,jedimaster,2012-02-24 01:04:00,3472, Well it serves bass pro right for treating so many of its customers so poorly.
669332,bramptonjerry,2012-02-24 01:08:00,132,"I kinda think the location, believe it or not, is not that great, only time people go by there is on their way up north, and I hate having to stop on a Friday night on my way up"
669339,cheaptackle,2012-02-24 01:16:00,849,Tried google & google news - only items there are about new stores opening in the states along with the usual pro-fishing & nascar sponsorships (and a bit about the store in Airdrie AB)  Michael
669343,BillM,2012-02-24 01:27:00,17367,I doubt BPS will be closing anytime soon.
669344,bigugli,2012-02-24 01:28:00,6138,Sounds like the wife is landing a big one
669346,Ice_ice,2012-02-24 01:29:00,18,"well there's your problem. Lol last time I checked, BPS was a company operating in States as well as in Canada. Don't remember a lot of places selling fishing hooks that went out of business...."
669347,Tom McCutcheon,2012-02-24 01:29:00,627,Probably at the hairdressers while she was making up the summer HONEY DOOO LIST
669348,jedimaster,2012-02-24 01:30:00,3472,"only thing i could find on bass pro is this..   Charges of racial discrimination by the EEOC  On September 21, 2011, the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) filed suit against Bass Pro. According to the EEOC’s suit filed in U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Texas, Houston Division (Civil Action No. 4:11-CV-3425), Bass Pro has been discriminating in its hiring since at least November 2005. The EEOC’s suit alleges that qualified African Americans and Hispanics were routinely denied retail positions such as cashier, sales associate, team leader, supervisor, manager and other positions at many Bass Pro stores nationwide.  The lawsuit alleges that managers at Bass Pro stores in the Houston area, in Louisiana, and elsewhere made overtly racially derogatory remarks acknowledging the discriminatory practices, including that hiring black candidates did not fit the corporate profile or customer demographics.[44]  The EEOC also alleges that managers at some stores retaliated against employees who expressed opposition to discriminatory practices and may have either fired or forced the resignation of others.[45]  Bass Pro Shops issued a statement denying the allegations and maintaining that the company had cooperated fully with an EEOC investigation.[45]"
669349,Raf,2012-02-24 01:30:00,3495,"with any luck, bps out, cabelas in."
669351,jedimaster,2012-02-24 01:32:00,3472,cabelas and a gander mountain would be nice.
669356,bramptonjerry,2012-02-24 01:38:00,132,"I guess she could be trying to scare me but, but I asked her again and she says it originates from a part time employee there, I'm not saying it's true but if anyone would have heard something you guys would be the ones I figure"
669374,DRIFTER_016,2012-02-24 02:15:00,10439,  Yup!!!
669377,cheaptackle,2012-02-24 02:22:00,849,"I also heard from an employee an unusual item - apparently the Vaughn store was having a bit of cash flow trouble in this first quarter caused by the amount of gift card redemption due to high sales of same before Christmas - isn't that a bad place to be in!  He was really worried about it too, my pointing out that they already had the money in hand didn't seem to calm him down one little bit.  I didn't have the heart to ask him what he did there, too many variables in that answer for me!  Oh to have millions in hand months before delivery....what a predicament!  And the big spring sale hasn't started yet to boot!  Wonder how many are holding their gift cards to use on that event!  That'll drive the poor guy over the edge for sure.  Personally I think they're here for the long haul - too much corporate backing to pack it in yet.  Michael"
669381,Fish Farmer,2012-02-24 02:42:00,2234,"Don't let the door hit you in the ass on the way out. Good bye to good rubbish. Last time I was there, I think there was only 3 people in the hole place. Maybe our money will stay here in Canada now. We've lost to much to the south."
669383,Meely,2012-02-24 02:50:00,282,Never heard of too many gift card sales equating to Cash flow problems........
669385,Sinker,2012-02-24 02:51:00,8692,"I've left there empty handed more times than I've found what i needed. No loss to me whatsoever. If I never set foot inside the doors there again, It wouldn't hurt my feelings one bit!  S."
669386,Pikeslayer,2012-02-24 02:52:00,1443,"I just heard from a very unreliable source (The Weather Network), that the GTA is going to get 10-15 cm of snow.  LMAO"
669391,bramptonjerry,2012-02-24 03:01:00,132,"the more I think about it, ice fishing season has been a total bust, so they could very well be under some pressure"
669402,ecmilley,2012-02-24 03:38:00,2163,and they sell boats tiller or console?
669409,Snidley,2012-02-24 03:56:00,620,"I think the Vaughn store is a pale shadow of the majority of US stores. I think that Canadians can actually get a better deal from the online BPS operation than our retail store. This is especially true since they lowered their shipping to Canada. Basically the Vaughn store does not carry most of the stuff I would want from Bass Pro Shops and really, their prices are out of line. That whole mall basically sucks IMO. Sail coming to Southern Ontario with 3 stores doesn't help either."
669410,John Bacon,2012-02-24 03:56:00,3277,Confirmed! That is already closed! . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . there are rumors that it will re-open in the morning.
