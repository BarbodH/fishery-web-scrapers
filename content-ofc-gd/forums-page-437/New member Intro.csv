669700,limeyangler,2012-02-24 23:48:00,5204,Sounds like you have bought a little piece of heaven!  Welcome to the board!
668898,whiskywizard,2012-02-22 18:42:00,305,"Hello folks, I should introduce myself...  I recently moved onto Sturgeon Lake (the southern Ontario one). I have been a hobby nagler for years, fished when on vacation, and a few bass tourneys. Now that I live on the lake I will be getting more serious about it.  I enjoy fishing for just about any species, but I think walleye and smallies are my favourite, followed by perch.  My wife and I have started exploring Sturgeon's hard waters by ATV, and I'm anxiously awaiting ice-out so I can get the boat in the water.  This past weekend we had the pleasure of meeting Big Cliff and Pikeslayer. Nice guys; they welcomed us to the area and offered up some good advice to help keep us safe on the quads. Thanks guys!"
668902,mercman,2012-02-22 18:45:00,7054,"Welcome WW !!! Any friend of Cliff and Simon, is a friend of mine  We like fish porn, so will us up"
668907,whiskywizard,2012-02-22 18:56:00,305," Cliff and Simon seemed like normal, decent guys, so I'm gonna assume this means pics of the fish we catch...  (thanks for the warm welcome. I look forward to a face-to-face handshake)"
668927,mercman,2012-02-22 19:42:00,7054," If all goes well, and plans stay the same, i may be up that way in Sept this year with a couple of other members"
668932,Joeytier,2012-02-22 19:55:00,3990,Welcome board.  You definitely have one of the best usernames. I wish I would've been as creative...
668933,Pikeslayer,2012-02-22 19:57:00,1443," Fooled Ya  With your handle, you'll fit right in. Welcome aboard Whiskey  BTW, sorry to tell you that there's no fish in Sturgeon. Zero, nada, zippo. Nice sunsets though. We were just drilling through the ice to harvest some greens to go with the frozen fish dinner."
668945,Big Cliff,2012-02-22 20:43:00,6899,"Well a very big welcome (again) to the area and to OFC. It was a real pleasure to meet you both this weekend.

668974,whiskywizard,2012-02-22 22:39:00,305,Thanks everybody. Very gracious bunch here!  The name Whiskywizard comes from something I love; single malt Scotch whisky. It seems to go well with a warm ice fishing hut too.
668975,Big Cliff,2012-02-22 22:41:00,6899,"OK, your twin is Simon!"
668981,Pikeslayer,2012-02-22 22:57:00,1443, Highland or lowland?

669008,pikehunter,2012-02-23 00:24:00,1659,"Welcome! Now tell us, how many whiskey shots does it take to look like your avatar?"
669032,whiskywizard,2012-02-23 01:44:00,305," They're all good. And everybody knows that good whisky cures all illnesses.  Of the Highlands, hard to pick a favourite. Highland Park is one. Also Glen Rothes. Of the Islays, my favourite might be Laphroiag. Maybe Ardbeg 21 year old. Or maybe Bunnahabhain. Of the Lowlands, it's definitely Rosebank.  I can't be the only guy here who like whisky, can I?"
669033,whiskywizard,2012-02-23 01:45:00,305, Hey! My mother said I was special.
669035,whiskywizard,2012-02-23 01:46:00,305, Great song. Never heard the Metallica version before . Thanks.
669291,camillj,2012-02-23 23:24:00,1988,"Welcome aboard ... and no you are definitely not the only one .. in fact I am savouring my ""daily medication"" even as I type this .... Bell's is my 5 O'clock special nothing fancy but does the trick ... and I will confess that I do have a particular fondness of The Glen Livet ... especially once it is at least old enough to vote"
669307,Joey,2012-02-24 00:17:00,9122,  We LOVE Naglers!!!   Especially Hobby ones  Welcome aboard!
669438,spincast,2012-02-24 10:35:00,3279,"Welcome aboard - naglers who appreciate single malts are a fine breed. Of course, if you were a real wizard, you would be able to make it appear, as well as disappear."
669599,fishindevil,2012-02-24 18:52:00,6254,"well i live on sturgeon lake just up from big cliff,so if you want we can hook up when the softwater comes and i can show you around the lake !!!! just send me a pm,i am at work right now,but we can chat some more ...guess we are niegbours now !!! lol..lol"
