669340,livinisfishin,2012-02-24 01:18:00,661,Hey guys I have an older aluminum boat that i have to replace the floor and the transom. I have done some research on the net about it but would like some first hand experience from those of you who have done it before.  thanks

669469,krixxer,2012-02-24 13:56:00,274,When I got my boat I needed to fix the floor transom and give 'er a general paint job. Materials were around 1k a few cases of beer and 3 months of weekend work at the shop.  If i had to pay someone to do the work (I have a paint shop) I think it would have been better to buy a newer boat. I think I have around 100 hours on her.  Now that she is done and ready I think she will be good for another 10 years +

If the boat model has much interior furniture, consoles, etc, the floor is more effort than the transom, however the transom work is more critical to the final function and safety of the boat.  Mine was a Sea Nymph FM161. Mid-70s vintage.  I didn't use marine grade plywood, but I was careful to completely encapsulate and seal the new transom, including through-hulls and all holes I drilled for fasteners.   It's been more than a few years - I think I remembered the important bits. The floor is similar, and the most important thing is sealing it properly. Anything you do will be better than what the factory did!"

669913,livinisfishin,2012-02-25 23:09:00,661,Seems like im going to be putting some serious work into my boat aswell as putting my carpentry skills to the test. Atleast in the end ill have something that should last me 10 years or more if i do it right. Thanks for the replies so far!
