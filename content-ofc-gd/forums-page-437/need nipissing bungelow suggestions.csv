665654,SirWhite,2012-02-11 22:43:00,210,I am in the South Bay now. SKUNKED. With IceBungalows.
665659,fishinmortician,2012-02-11 23:16:00,100,"stayed at idle tyme last year, great time. This year stayed off ice with Bear Creek Cottages.  Wasn't tripping over rods all night and steping all over dead shinners."
665663,Rod Caster,2012-02-11 23:53:00,5784," Tough fishing the past few days. The sharp weather changes must have an effect. I was off the lake 300pm, one huge herring, one walleye and several perch. Did you guys remain skunked?"
665756,SirWhite,2012-02-12 04:10:00,210, 13 perch in 36 hours (and one salamander) between 6 guys. Of that six only 2 have caught anything. I spent about two and a half hours outside as well. And nothing. Sux
665815,Nipfisher,2012-02-12 14:58:00,2449, Rod Caster just texted me this morning and he is KILLING the walleye out on South Shore right now. Can't controll the weather.
666004,registerfly,2012-02-13 04:30:00,198,"We used Nipissing Ice huts/bungalows during the GTG. Derek and Mike were great. Took us out to a couple locations and go us into some decent fish, when there were none at the huts. Would love to have been on south shore again and get the walleyes  we got some that weekend an some whitefish. They tasted as good as the walleyes"
668866,brixtonbeat,2012-02-22 17:02:00,11, Yup. Angler's Haven is great!
668889,Thrilla,2012-02-22 18:25:00,164,"Went on my first bungalow experience this year, Chilly Will's ... It was ok, expected better fishing from the huts but he did take us out ddep and we had some great action, kind of a strange duck. Prob try someone else next year"
668949,tightline,2012-02-22 20:48:00,322,Had a great time at Idle Tymes 2 years ago..would definitely go again
668953,bdox,2012-02-22 20:55:00,329,"Had an awesome day at Idyl Tymes 3 weeks ago, so we went back on our own this past weekend. While the fishing wasnt the best this time it was just fun to bomb around the lake in the truck and drill holes!"
668970,bubbles,2012-02-22 22:29:00,591,"SSIC - fantastic outfir, will put you on fish."
669019,duramax20,2012-02-23 01:16:00,1,"I did snowfari this year, the service was awful and the fishing no better... No fish out of the bungalows that were just off shore and if we wanted to catch fish we had to drive way out and pay extra for another hut, and the outfitters didn't come out or give us any help,  only thing supplied was propane. I'm glad I had my own auger cause they made holes at 10 then didn't come back out till almost 4 in the afternoon if u are thinking of planning a trip snowfari is a bad choice"
