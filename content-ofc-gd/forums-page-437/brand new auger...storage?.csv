It has never been out . Is it okay staying like this until i use  it or should i take it out,and start it up,then summerize it. really thought this was the year I get to use it."
669123,whiskywizard,2012-02-23 15:25:00,305,"Normally, a manufacturer doesn't properly lay-up an engine before it's sold. They don't plan on the equipment sitting un-used for years. Often, they are not even test-run first.  The only Jiffy I'm familiar with has a Techumseth 2-cycle engine. If your's is the same, I'd suggest that you not fuel it up. If you do, you'll have to drain the tank and carb. Instead, I'd pull out the spark plug and fog it. Pull it over a few times gently and re-install the plug.  "
669124,Fisherman,2012-02-23 15:26:00,7201, Why would you put gas in it and then have to do storage maintenance...
669125,bow slayer,2012-02-23 15:31:00,1074,with it sitting for so long i thought maybe a good idea to run it so it gets some lube in the cylinders.But i guess just spraying in some storage spray and turning it over would work
669130,Old Man,2012-02-23 15:39:00,822,"Pull the plug and fog the cylinder, put the plug back and you should be good for another year or two."
