669303,CRAPPIE,2012-02-24 00:01:00,213,"Hi,  Just want to ask where can I buy a kayak which can fit into a medium size car's trunk? I live in an apartment and no storage space. Any company made short size kayak?  Thanks in advance!"
669365,Dave Bailey,2012-02-24 01:52:00,1641," I would suggest a decent inflatable, Sevylor products come to mind. I don't have any experience with them but I'm certain someone will chime in."
669373,DRIFTER_016,2012-02-24 02:14:00,10439,"An inflatable is the way to go. If you have the $$$$ look at good quality boats such as Aire, Sea Eagle, Innova or Advanced Elements."
669390,Sharkbait22,2012-02-24 03:00:00,297,Don't know what you are using it for but check out the OSG Commander http://www.outcastboats.com/outcast/products/?id=43
669532,CRAPPIE,2012-02-24 16:43:00,213,Thanks for advise. Inflatable is not the one I want. I still interested in the Kayak.
