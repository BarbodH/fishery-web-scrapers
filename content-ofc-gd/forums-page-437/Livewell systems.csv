Plus I think one or more of the hoses may be leaking. Regardless I cannot risk livewell failure so an once of pervention...My boat is a Ranger 487vs and it has the dual, rear positioned livewells. I can simply reinstall the same system that is there with new parts but I'd thought I'd get some advise on potential upgrades. Oxygenators? Pumpouts? I have ""Empty"" and ""Auto"" controls. Is ""Empty"", ""Fill"" and ""Recirc"" a better setup?  Thanks!  "
668560,ecmilley,2012-02-21 18:45:00,2163,"i suggest you check out www.bassboatcentral.com for advice on upgrades  on my ranger i replaced all the hoses, rebuilt the valves and installed 800 gph livewell pumps instead of the 500gph they came with"
668573,grimsbylander,2012-02-21 20:00:00,3016,"  Those valves you rebuilt, were they the cable operated FlowRite valves? I was not aware they can be rebuilt. I've looked at pumps as well and the ones made by Rule seem to be popular."
668694,ecmilley,2012-02-22 00:49:00,2163,"you can rebuild the flowrite valves cost is about 20 bux for both valves rubber flappers, you can also buy the new valves for 30 bux each. i put the rule pumps in ss well, takes up a little more space in the bilge but they have replace main pump bodys so when they do burn out it's a quick change, they also have a extra port so you can attach a wash pump if desired, (my next project) good to quickly flush the cooling system on an engine when i suck up more lily pads and crap or cleaning livewells"
668957,aplumma,2012-02-22 21:26:00,6896, I did the same thing and adjusted the hoses for more room to mount my transducer on a 1989 Ranger.   Art
669028,grimsbylander,2012-02-23 01:36:00,3016,"The hoses in my boat are getting hard from age and no doubt leaking. I can replace the parts but I was just wondering if there are any ""must haves"" I should install while I'm at it. I've read about pump outs, aerators, etc. even dual bilge pumps maybe? Any opinions from the group would be appreciated. Thx!"
