So far the answers gotten are to go Greyhound and a place called AutoBus contact Roy(Les0 807-329-5831, don't know if this is a bus to Nakina or Limo.

If I find any other options I will post them here"
667753,DanD,2012-02-18 21:55:00,2223,"Larry. I really appreciate the leg work you’ve done for us and it won’t be forgotten; just ask if I can do for you. Right or wrong expense wise, I think we’re going to rent a car and be done with it. That way we’ll be on our own schedule and not commercial providers (after the flight to Thunder Bay); I’m just trying to take a few bends out of the road getting to Nakina. That doesn’t mean I’m not willing too look at other suggestions; so far we like the idea of the freedom of our own wheels.  Thanks again.  Dan."
667773,Larry in Nevada,2012-02-19 00:35:00,8,"  Dan, No problem,I'm glad I could try and help.  If renting a car is the best solution for getting your brother to Nakina with a minimum of problems,Do It!  You will have a great time at Eddie's. I have never been to his camp,but have fished in that area with Northern Outposts at several different lakes.  I'm going to the Pickle Lake Area this year,I'm not sure yet,but maybe to North Caribou Lake. Went there in 2007 and caught a Ton of fish  Have a great time planning your trip,and post a report with pictures when you get back  If any thing else on an alternative way to Nakina comes up,I will send you details 	Take Care Larry S"
667979,SlowPoke,2012-02-19 22:07:00,2984,"I can lend you a Lowrance 522 GPS/SONAR and can probably figure something out for a transducer. I just have the ice-ducer for the portable. By the way, drive or fly? How long do you want to leave the boys at the shop unattended? LOL"
667986,walleye wanderer,2012-02-19 22:50:00,64,"Dan, Given your brothers health I think flying is the best option. As for getting from TB to Nakina, Nakina Air can take care of that but it is quite pricey. Option two is a rental that will sit at the float plane base for a week. I am looking into another option which will involve a shuttle from Nakina, I hope to have some more info in the next 2 weeks and I'll be sure to let you know whatever I find out. Remember positive thinking can make powerful things happen.  I am sure all of the members of OFC are hoping positive good things happen for your brother and maybe combined with the magic of the Attawapiskat things will turn around."
667989,DanD,2012-02-19 23:03:00,2223,"Hey Brian. Thanks for the offer and I may take you up on it. I have a transducer from an old portable that might work, with your unit? I was looking at a portable (can’t remember what breed right now) it came with a carrying case, jell battery, charger and suction cup for the transducer. It went for something like $250; I know not the best of units but it’ll give us depths and structure. Morris would likely go half on the unit and I was thinking of giving it to Eddie at the end of the trip. He’s done so much for us that I feel I owe him something extra. I’ll give you the details on that the next time you’re at the shop; quit being a stranger. You know you’re always welcome for a Bull session; even if you haven’t broken one of your vehicles. As far as the guys looking after the shop; it’s not a worry; I think? Besides, they know I have friends like you   and that I’ll hear about it if they’re butt warming the benches; instead of cleaning my shop when there’s little work. I know you’re also busy with the trucking and everything; but stop in when you get a chance.  Dan."
667990,DanD,2012-02-19 23:07:00,2223, Thanks that seems like all I'm saying; everyone's been so helpful.  Promise I'll give back wherever I can.  Dan.

As soon as I confirm our flights; then the rest should fall in place. You’ve done so much already with the dates at your camp; that it’s time we stepped up ourselves and get things done.

669093,DanD,2012-02-23 12:29:00,2223,"May 25th was the date that Eddie first offered us; but regretfully had to ask for another. I'm still kicking myself for not being able to go that week; not that there's anything special that week But my daughters law school graduation is being held on June 3rd at 9:30 in the morning in Ottawa There was no way wed be able to get from the camp, back to TB for a flight to Ottawa and make it in time.  Can you imagine pissing off a 26 year old female lawyer and then try living with her; I'd have to walk around like one of these guys.   Joking aside there's no way I would even think of missing that; shes worked so hard for it and shes the first in our family to become a Laywer; can ya tell Im proud Most of the arrangements have been booked for our July 14th trip. WestJet from TO to TB, a rental car at the airport, pick up our fishing gear and dry goods at Fedex, the nights stay in Nakina at Twin Lakes and then were in Eddies hands for the week. A room for the Saturday night at Best Western on our return to TB; where they have agreed  to hold our fishing gear for Fedex pick up on the Monday; Fedex is not open on the weekends. Then we fly out Sunday at 3:45.pm back to TO. Why Fedex, were only allowed 50lbs weight on the WestJet flight; so were sending the gear ahead of time; they have a pick up terminal right at the airport. Cheaper then paying extra weight or over sized luggage rates (rod cases) to the airlines and my wife gets a discount rate from her work for Fedex. Would have been an extra $200 each to fly out of London and then still have a stop and change planes in Toronto; one of our wives will drive us to YYZ. The car rental will be around $200. for the week (before taxes); saving about $125. by using my vehicles insurance company, rather then taking the rental companies insurance. Just need to get a letter from my insurance company stating they know what were doing.  Can anyone copy this map, mark where Eddies camp is and then repost it for me?  Dan. "

667146,DanD,2012-02-16 19:02:00,2223,"Just confirmed our trip with Eddie, for our week up at Beteau Lake this July; I can’t believe we’re actually going. My one brother and I have always talked about a fly-in and with him being diagnosed with terminal cancer; which has for now gone into a form of remission; it’s now or possibly never. My reason for posting is; I’d like to hear the pros and cons of driving all the way to Nakina or flying to Thunder Bay, renting an econo-box and driving the last 4 hours? Here’s my thinking; it’s a 32-34 hours round trip drive for us; that’s allowing for pit stops. My brother’s health will likely only allow us 8 hours max at a time; meaning 2 motel rooms along the way @ approx $75-90 each. I drive an Avalanche and figure it’ll take 5-6 tanks of fuel @ approx $130 each. Add that up and it comes to around 950 bucks. If we fly into Thunder Bay, the round trip flight is $320. each; a rental car for the week is approx $350 with 1920Klm included, gas maybe a $80-100, these prices are tax in. This adds up to around $1100. 150 bucks more, but less then ¼ of the traveling time. The flights that I checked we’d land in Thunder Bay at 10:30am; we’d pick up the car at the airport. Head to the nearest Crappy tire or wherever and grab a couple of disposable coolers, hit up a grocery store for our supplies (only allowed 50lbs with Air Canada or West jet meaning cloths and fishing gear only) and then off to Nikina for a nights stay, before we fly out Saturday morning for Eddie’s camp? So tell me what have I missed and why I should or should not fly?  Dan."
667148,BillM,2012-02-16 19:05:00,17367,"A 2hr flight beats that drive any day of the week!  If it wasn't for your brothers health I'd say drive, but he'll be a lot more comfortable with plan B."
667179,adempsey,2012-02-16 20:31:00,1498,"I figure it cuts the trip in half time wise - 10 hours driving between Nakina and Thunderbay, 4 hours driving to Toronto (assuming that's where you are flying from), 4 hours waiting at the airport both flights (yes this will happen), flight time is 2 hours?  add another 1-2 hours to that for taxiing.  It's probably still worth it though, I just think your numbers might be a bit off.  I am not sure, but maybe you could catch a flight from Thunderbay to Geraldton on Wasaya Airways?   Not sure if that helps that much though.  Wonder if you could fly to the outpost from Geraldton?  Train is another option, but I am sure it's not that much cheaper than flying these days.  Personally I don't mind driving, especially with a stop over or two. I find flying very grueling.  I always feel nauseous when I fly - nothing to do with nerves or the actual flight, just all the waiting and sitting around.  Ultimately, I would leave it up to your brother to decide.  Maybe a couple nights sleep during the trip might actually be better for him?"
667182,Bondar,2012-02-16 20:41:00,817,"What is your weight restriction to fly into camp with?  I'm assuming you'll need to have some coolers and stuff like that? I'm pretty sure if I was flying in for a week I'd need more than 50lbs worth of gear , but I've never done it so I'm just guessing"
667200,BillM,2012-02-16 21:34:00,17367," 50lbs per person, Eddie is good about flying in beer beforehand (he did with us)"
667208,solopaddler,2012-02-16 21:45:00,8605,"Dan I'm so glad to hear you're going to make the trip with your brother. Great news!  Anything I can do to assist in the planning don't hesitate to ask.  Based on what you've outlined there's no question: fly to Thunder Bay.  Before I commited to a rental car for the last leg I'd check first with Eddie to see if pick up/drop off could be arranged.  He knows lots of people in Nakina and that may end up being cheaper for you than renting.  As far as the weight restrictions go you'll be bringing just your clothing and fishing gear on the flight to Thunder Bay.  You can buy your groceries, beverages, ice, etc, etc, once you get there. Consider buying cheap throwaway styrofoam coolers rather than spending money on proper ones.  Also there's an excellent possibility that Eddie may be able to have much of the food you'll need pre flown in. I know he mentioned offering that service last time we spoke, so ask him about that as well.  Congrat's, you've got much to look forward to!"
667332,DanD,2012-02-17 01:59:00,2223,"Thanks for the replies; I'm not going to do the quote thing with responses to the posts; all great replies, they will help.  -	Yes we would be flying out of TO but that’s just a little over an hour and ¼ from my home. Non international flights, you only need too check in an hour before take off. Yea the flight leaves at 8:45 and lands at 10:30; but I do agree there will be wait times before and after the actual flights. -	West Jet or Air Canada only allows 50lbs free luggage; Eddie allows 100lbs on the flight to the camp. -	Yea Eddie will pre fly extra weight (with in reason); pop, beer or whatever; if there is room on flights before yours. -	Mike, Eddie has done so much in trying to accommodate us the only extra thing I may ask, is to pre-fly our hooch in. Well my hooch and my brother’s pop. Yea the cheap styrofoam coolers idea I got from you the last time we talked, on another thread.  Thanks and don’t worry I’ll PM you if there are any of those oh crap questions that might pop up.                                                                             When I go too book our Friday night stay in Nakina; I was going to ask the owners of the motel, if they were willing or knew someone that would drive us for some sort of cash deal?  Thanks guys and please, anyone feel free too comment on the idea of drive or fly. The only thing I can think of that I cannot prepare for is if Mother Nature grounds us? It’s mid July when we’re going so I’m hoping she won’t kick up to much of a fuss at that time of year?  Dan."
667340,irishfield,2012-02-17 02:10:00,26272,"Not a big chance of AC or WJ getting grounded by weather Dan. Instrument approaches at both ends of the trip to Thunder Bay. Into Eddies camp could be another story.  Your brother's not up for that drive Dan, but you know that or you wouldn't be askin."
667342,solopaddler,2012-02-17 02:10:00,8605,"Dan you mentioned asking the motel owners in Nakina about a lift.  Pennocks motel in Nakina is frankly disgusting LOL!  What many guys have been doing myself included is staying overnight at Lower Twin Lakes Lodge a couple km's outside of town.  The owners John and Karen are truly great people and their cabins are 10X nicer than staying in the motel. Cost is about the same as well.  There's also a good chance that they could arrange a shuttle for you.  I was staying at their place last fall and I know for an absolute fact they arranged pickup at the airport for a young German couple who stayed overnight in one of their cabins then flew into Eddies the next day.  If you call John tell him I sent you and he ""should"" take care of you.  https://lowertwinlakes.com/"
667366,Pikeslayer8,2012-02-17 03:01:00,336,"Dan, I used to always fly from Denver to Minneapolis where my bil would pick us up and drive the rest of the way with him.  I quit doing that primarily because I hated leaving the fate of my trip in their hands.  Each year it got worse.  Between me and my two boys, we are allowed 3 checked bags.  Rod case is considered oversize and the airlines are charging as much as 75$.  That left two duffels for three of us containing all gear and tackle boxes, fish finders etc.  The duffels have to weigh 50# or less.  Very tricky to say the least.  I would have to just bring 1 tray of jigs and a few cranks and harnesses.  I felt a bit naked having to pare my tackle so drastic.    The boys would carry on overnight bags that we would stash a few extra camp items in and I would take my soft-side boat cooler as my carry on.  Lol. Now I drive.  I really enjoy the drive.  Great bonding time.  There is nothing better than spending this time with the trip anticipation getting more intense the closer we get to the destination.  All part of the adventure soon to be undertaken. Your trip with your brother is so very cool.  Don't rush it!  Spend this extra time with him and hash out the brother talk on your drive.  Save the boat time for nothing but great memories of this awesome adventure to Beteau. My .02 cents."
667393,DanD,2012-02-17 03:46:00,2223,"Shows you what I know I thought Twin Lakes was the motel? I didn’t actually check; I saw a phone number on Eddie’s site as recommended accommodations, assuming that it was the motel. What’s the saying, making assumptions makes a something something????? Glad you posted Mike.  Wayne yea your right; I wanted to see if anyone had a good reason for not flying. And I guess I’m still old school, with the mind set that if you can drive there why fly; but this time it’s making more and more sense too?  Pikeslayer. I know what you’re saying; but this isn’t our first trip together. We been going for years; but never so far and he hasn’t been ill. We thought last year was our last trip (Temagami); but the Doc says go for it while he’s in remission. Morris my brother says he doesn’t care how we get there, as long as we’re going. But I know him, by the 6th or 7th hour in the truck; he’ll be half stoned from the perc’s that he’s popped for the pain.  Dan."
667401,craigdritchie,2012-02-17 04:06:00,1586,"Pikeslayer,  As someone who flies a lot (4x-5x/month, 80,000 to 100,000 miles/year) I have to say there's a world of difference between US-based and Canadian-based airlines. Our guys aren't perfect by any means, but I've found that they're usually a lot more accommodating toward oversized or overweight baggage (which for me is often a trade show display) than US-based airlines. Perhaps because they get a LOT of it? In any case, I've found they're fairly accommodating provided you call them in advance to arrange things - just show up at the airport and you'll pay through the snoot every time.  Just my .02 cents as well.  Hey - between us, we have 4 cents!"
667404,irishfield,2012-02-17 04:12:00,26272, Didn't wanna stick my nose there Dan.. but I know how beat he was just getting to Temagami last year. Watching Jen fight a 1.75 hour drive from TO to home everytime during treatment was no fun for anyone.. her especially and I'd hate to see you get all the way up there by driving and have Morris so beat he just crashes in the cabin.
667411,DanD,2012-02-17 04:30:00,2223,Your input is always welcome Wayne.  I’ve pretty much made my mind up; one more talk with Morris and I’ll try and get actual bookings and see how much info/costs are not shown on the airline’s Web sites?  Thanks everybody!!!!  Dan.

There is train service to Nakina but Via hasnt been going to Thunder Bay since 1989; something about a right of way dispute with CP rail and Via said were out of here? Morris is coming over tonight and were going to sit down and hash out what were doing. I like nofish4mes attitude and hes right, weve blown more then the rental cars cost on things and never thought twice about it. It is a bit of a kick in the pants to have a rental car for a week and only actually use it for 10  12 hours; but the ease of having it will likely make up for the costs.  Tjsa very generous offer; talk to you over in the PM area.  Mike or anyone else thats been to Edies camp; is there graphs in his boats or should I bring a portable if I wanted the use of one?
