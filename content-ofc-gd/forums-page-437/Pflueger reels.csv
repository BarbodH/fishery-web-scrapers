668602,dylan21,2012-02-21 21:30:00,22,what are you guys thoughts on the pflueger president reel?  I've read a bunch of good reviews on this reel. There are guys that say that they were all shimano before until they picked up one of these  So i would like to hear all of your opinions.  Thx

668613,bigugli,2012-02-21 21:56:00,6138,My president lasted almost 5 years before scrapping this winter. For the dollar paid the reel was exceptional as I was using it primarily as my cat and carp reel. Certainly did better than a number of Stradics I have seen.
668617,adempsey,2012-02-21 22:12:00,1498,"Don't own one, but they have been an extremely popular reel for a long time.  Known for being a really good ""bang for your buck"", so to speak.  If you search the net for some reviews you will see what I mean.   I'd probably own a President or Supreme if I didn't dislike the feel of the handle so much."
668618,Lunatic,2012-02-21 22:13:00,536,"I bought one last year as a back up to my shimano setup and love it.I now use them both equally I'm not sure I like it better than my shimano, but I don't think I like it any less either"
668641,Joeytier,2012-02-21 22:54:00,3990,"President's are an excellent bargain.  I've been using mine year round for the past 3 years and it's yet to let to me down.  The drag and anti-reverse have been 100% flawless, even in the absolute coldest of conditions.  It's seen braid, mono, and even fluoro and handled them all fine."
668661,dylan21,2012-02-21 23:49:00,22,"Thanks guys, ive been looking in investing in one for this season."
668670,grt1,2012-02-22 00:03:00,638,"i got one for the wife, i liked it so much i got one for myself. lots of ball bearings and smooth action. for the money it is hard to beat, i think i paid about 69 dollars for it at cabelas in owatanna"
668671,Live2fish85,2012-02-22 00:07:00,1633,Awesome reel. For the buck you can't beat it. I also haven't had any problems with them and they have seen cold days and no problems.
668771,Mike the Pike,2012-02-22 04:42:00,3421,love my Shimanos especially my Stradic 4000 but I bought a Pflueger President 3500 2 summers ago and I absolutely love it.  My favorite for sure so light and smooth.  Great bang for the buck.
668798,asdve23rveavwa,2012-02-22 12:53:00,2690,"Buy it, you won't be sorry."
668799,DoubleDigits,2012-02-22 12:59:00,140,"I am on my second president, and love it. The first one died after a year of heavy abuse fishing in saltwater (used it for 2-3 years before that with no problems)"
668978,hurraylien,2012-02-22 22:47:00,95,"Got one this fall for steelhead and it has preformed great so far, even dropped it in the drink and it still worked well right after"
669260,dylan21,2012-02-23 21:54:00,22,Thanks guys for your inputs. Gonna get one for sure soon.
669284,kickingfrog,2012-02-23 23:00:00,8333,"bps will have the supreme on sale for $30 off plus you can save another $25 if you bring in a reel during their trade-in sale. Check their web site for details and flyer.  BTW I really like my supreme that I picked up last year but, I also have a stradic that is 20 years old that works just as well as the day I bought it."
669398,Canuck2fan,2012-02-24 03:15:00,1444,"I like the 3 I have.... for the money I don't think they can be beat. If you put them up against any other manufacturers reel at the same price, you won't go wrong with the President. Two of mine are 6yrs old I used to steelhead 4 times a week with them all winter long for two years using one to bottom fish and one to float.  I like that they are tough as nails and cheap enough you don't have to baby them."
