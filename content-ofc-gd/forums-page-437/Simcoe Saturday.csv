668940,danbouck,2012-02-22 20:27:00,4380,"So I am able to come up to Simcoe for The Fishing For Tyler Event. I need to know the best spot to take my 5 year old out on the ice.  I am a little paranoid when I take him on the ice, this year multiply that by 1000   So I need to know where the best spot is and I don't really care how good the fishing is (But it would be nice to ice a perch this winter)  Any help is appreciated."
668941,asdve23rveavwa,2012-02-22 20:30:00,2690,"Still plenty of spots for perch with good ice, Dan.  The ""Simcoe boys"" on the board will point you in the right direction.  We will be over at Port Bolster area."

669057,Sinker,2012-02-23 03:06:00,8692,"I'd say the east side has the best ice, and best fishing right now. Drilled thru 16"" today, and got some nice perch"
