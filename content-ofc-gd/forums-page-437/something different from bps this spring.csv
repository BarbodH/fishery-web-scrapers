669173,kickingfrog,2012-02-23 17:48:00,8333,This year bps has a rod trade-in deal similar to the reel trade-in.  Don't remember them doing that in the past in Canada.
669182,captpierre,2012-02-23 18:14:00,2521,Cool.  Busted rods?
669184,Spiel,2012-02-23 18:21:00,9065,"I don't trade in used or new rods, I give 'em away to kids."
669187,adempsey,2012-02-23 18:34:00,1498," Actually, the rods have to be in working condition and they are donated to children's programs =)"
669194,Spiel,2012-02-23 19:03:00,9065, Well that's a plus.  Guess I'm just eliminating the middle man and the long drive to BPS.
669195,jedimaster,2012-02-23 19:06:00,3472,Anyone have the details on the rod trade in?
669207,kickingfrog,2012-02-23 19:29:00,8333,Yep
669225,jedimaster,2012-02-23 19:59:00,3472,and...
669231,BucktownAngler,2012-02-23 20:16:00,582," Next time ask, ""Can anybody provide additional information?"" lol   "
669236,jedimaster,2012-02-23 20:23:00,3472,pullin teeth sometimes. rofl thanks man.  Is it only one trade in coupon per new rod?
669248,misfish,2012-02-23 21:09:00,29133,    Me too. I have 3 grandchildren now.
669456,Fang,2012-02-24 13:27:00,1330,Looks like the reel trade in is March 9th-14th and then the rod trade in is the 16th to 20th - 2 trips Yikes!  The Ontario store site is starting to post the sale details by day and programs but as yet has not released the actual flyer as far as I can see.  Check out the Auburn store and that should be close if you want a sneak peak at the flyer
