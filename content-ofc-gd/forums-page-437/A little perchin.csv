This being my first official trip with my flasher, I couldn't believe the difference it made in understanding the mood of fish.  Given that I spent most of the day on the ice, I was even able to see how the reaction to certain cadances changed throughout the day according to sunlight.  Even with the perch, the difference was very noticeable.  I hooked an easy mid 20's inch walleye after having to raise him nearly 3 feet off bottom before he committed.  He got off at the hole, but that was a fish I certainly wouldn't have coaxed into hitting had I not had my underwater eyes.  Anyone know why the screen shows up like this on video?  The solid lines seem to disappear on film. My link"

669045,bubbles,2012-02-23 02:22:00,591,"I find all the talking very distracting, takes away from the action."
669046,Joeytier,2012-02-23 02:23:00,3990,Yeah yeah...I was hoping the video would've illustrated the flasher a little more.
669205,Rod Caster,2012-02-23 19:21:00,5784,"sweet, now you have a flasher and a video camera? I have no idea what that flasher was telling you, looks like a random light generator to me."
669229,limeyangler,2012-02-23 20:14:00,5204,Awesome. You will not want to fish 'blind' again.
669232,Joeytier,2012-02-23 20:17:00,3990,"I always used to laugh when people would say that, but in many instances it's not far from the truth."
669265,OrangePeal,2012-02-23 22:02:00,37,"OK how do I explain the flasher on your video. The flasher is turning at a certain rpm. your video camera is at a certain fps (frames per second). Depending apon when your camera captures a frame the flasher might be a any location. That is why sometimes you see a red line and sometimes the green and sometimes nothing.  Did that explain it?  Have you evernoticed that when recording a video of your tv the line seems to scan down the tv. Same problem.....they are not sync'd.  Safe Fishing First, Jack"
669282,Leecher,2012-02-23 22:59:00,7832, Says who     I fish blind and I like it   Don't laugh cause it ain't funny     Just kidding
669748,bramptonjerry,2012-02-25 02:40:00,132,"it's obviously some sort of mind control device, I've watched that video 4 times, learned nothing, but I MUST GO FISHING"
