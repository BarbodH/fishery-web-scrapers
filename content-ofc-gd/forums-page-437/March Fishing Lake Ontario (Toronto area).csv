Any info about city fishing would be greatly appreciated"

667649,Franzo,2012-02-18 01:30:00,5,Thanks I'll check it out
667724,Acountdeleted,2012-02-18 16:57:00,2562," In terms of harbour fishing you can't go wrong with the Toronto islands. We always manage to pull lots of Bass, Pike, Bowfin and the occasional Walleye out of there. If you don't feel like going that far I know there is a killer weedbed in...... I wanna say the Bathurst slip. I can't remember the name but its the harbour to the west of the huge ship from Thunder Bay (its always there).  Lastly, if you don't mind leaving the outer harbour, just slightly to the east is Tommy Tompson Park (or the Leslie street Spit to some of you) the pike fishing in the spring there is always good.  Hope these keep you busy. Let me know how you do."
667754,Franzo,2012-02-18 22:21:00,5, hey thanks alot! ill check these spots out for sure and keep everyone posted!
667759,captpierre,2012-02-18 23:47:00,2521,I would consider trolling off the Pickering Nuclear Plant.  Browns and Bows.  Maybe a salmon.  Or go right into the east outflow to catch browns for sure that time of year.  Best to use a floater suit in water that cold.  peter
667968,Franzo,2012-02-19 21:35:00,5,Are there boat launches near Pickering power plant?
668128,Acountdeleted,2012-02-20 03:51:00,2562,Frenchmans bay is your best bet for the boat launch. While you are there you need to for sure fish the bay. Largemouth Bass and Pike are a plenty and very large in there. Check the east side around the docks. (course only target bass after the last saturday in June)
668292,captpierre,2012-02-20 22:11:00,2521,You  can launch into the bay from the sandy spit near  the end of the road from the west side..  You may need 4X4 if you have a larger boat.  May be ice at the launch now.  There is a marina on the east side of the bay but not sure the launch would be open now.  There is a great public launch in Whitby Harbour on the west side.  it's a 15-20 run west to the Nuke Plant.  Minnows work best by far.  Treat Lake O with great respect.  Especially this time of year.  Deadly cold water and likely nobody out there if you get into trouble.  Pick a calm day or stay home.  Wear a floatation suit.
