86251,brifishrgy,2007-06-21 03:20:00,559,tube and a spinner bait ... I love the 2 rod rule on Erie ... will set my sons rod up with a minnow on 1 and a crayfish on the other ... he will prob get a bigger bass then me again
86269,pikeie,2007-06-21 03:58:00,380,"green pumkin senko for sure, i will be picking apart the many weed pockets, then i cant wait to try out some of the bever tail soft plastics they look real interesting!"
86272,xrap,2007-06-21 04:10:00,683,"Topwater frog, buzz/spinner bait, clown coulor xrap, shad raps. Good luck everyone!!"
86329,Seaweed,2007-06-21 13:30:00,135,I will be throwing a nice mix of things.  One rod will be rigged with a plastic frog.  One rod will be rigged with a spinnerbait.  One rod will be rigged with a Senko for those missed follow-up casts on the topwater action.  One rod will be rigged with the Drop-shot ... a new thing for me... I think a lot of big fish will be deeper than we think in the post spawn.  One rod will have a crankbait that I have to remind myself to throw.  One rod will be rigged with a jignpig  One rod will be rigged with a nice tube offering.  Did I miss anything?  Honestly though... I spend a lot of time working shallow action so the frog will see a ton of action and the spinnerbait might come on later after I try a buzzbait early in the day near weedlines.
86361,mikeymikey,2007-06-21 14:34:00,376,"I'll be tossing Skum Frog.    -------- I have a question to those using Senko style plastics, what type of rod, reel & line do you use ?"
86364,Fishnfiend,2007-06-21 14:38:00,357,"Spinnerbait for sure, looking for active fish.  Then, some soft plastic offering for following up any missed hits."
86372,Maida_gc,2007-06-21 15:03:00,5,"Think I'll go:  Early - Would love to land one on a Buzz Bait. After that just move to plasitcs. Bleeding Tube, Grubs and worms. Going to give the floating worm a try as well - bubblegum hot pink."
86378,Aaron Shirley,2007-06-21 15:11:00,655,"I plan to go for largies, so it will be a spinnerbait and Skitterwalk first thing in the morning.  When that bite slows, I'll be tossing an Exude Comida (Senko style) bait and jig and pig.  I will also try shallow crank baits as well.  Good bass openers!  Aaron"
86380,Guest lundboy,2007-06-21 15:14:00,0,"I'll start with a tube for small mouth and see what I get.  Then probably spinner baits, and then 3""-4"" green pumpkin grubs"
86386,mattyk,2007-06-21 15:38:00,2110,spinner bait or buzzbait.
86424,Whitemikeca,2007-06-21 17:31:00,138,I am heading up to Buckhorn this weekend and I plan on starting with Topwater if the water is calm.  I recently bought a Lucky Craft Sammy topwater and given its $20 price tag it better catch a few.  I will probably move on to a Slop Master after that and I might throw a few tubes and senkos as well.
86428,huntervasili,2007-06-21 17:35:00,1604,Nice big topwater bait... Maybe one of those spro frogs... Something like that though... I only have one day for the next 8 weeks to bass fish and its on the opening day sop I better get me a couple!!! Good luck to all you too
86429,keram,2007-06-21 17:37:00,585,"Looks like all the basics are covered. First at daybreak topwaters, then spinnerbaits, then plastics, then about 11 am few prayers   , and if by noon I'm still skunked I cast my secret weapon with the wind ( farther is safer )    . It is just ""stick bait""  impregnated with TNT, works everytime, never skunked on bass opener  :thumbsup_anim:  :lol:"
86452,OhioFisherman,2007-06-21 18:59:00,6623,First lure for me for largemouth is usually a 4 inch ring worm rigged weedless or not depending on the cover. Hard to beat top water but I w
86455,OhioFisherman,2007-06-21 19:07:00,6623,"First lure for me for largemouth is usually a 4 inch ring worm rigged weedless or not depending on the cover. Hard to beat top water but I want to catch and see what is hitting. If the lake has a mix of bass, L/M and S/M the 4 inch worm will take both with out the misses on smallies you get from a bigger worm."
86594,Rich,2007-06-22 02:01:00,3927,I rarely start the day with anything but my trusty black buzzbait.
86598,tedley,2007-06-22 02:30:00,36,doesn't bass season start the last saturday of june which is the 30th. if not a topwater hula popper

86683,gregger27,2007-06-22 14:09:00,14,Well while your all out FISHING I will be working this Saturday at BPS. But on Wednesday the 27th I think I will start with Spro Frog and see how that goes.  Enjoy the opener this weekend.
86785,kennyman,2007-06-22 19:27:00,737,"I bought two Northam Fishing  spinnerbaits ( I think ""perch"" and ""green bass"" patterns)  at the Spring Fishing Show and have been saving them for this weekend. They sure are ""perdy"". Hope they catch some fish."
86808,kemper,2007-06-22 22:27:00,2232,"I still havent decided if Im going out for opener yet, have to work 1-10 tomorrow but if I head out before work its gonna have to be the topwater in the early morning and going to soft plastics/spinnerbaits depending on how active they are."
86115,wask,2007-06-20 20:51:00,174,I'll start with a texas rigged shad colored senko... what about you?
86118,lunkerbasshunter,2007-06-20 20:53:00,2585,im leaning toward a tube bait for smallies right off the bat.  maybe switch to a jig and pig for largies.  Cheers!
86119,Stoty,2007-06-20 20:54:00,2910,TOPWATER for me!!!!!!!! Nothing like that explosion to get your heart pumping a little faster!
86121,ADC,2007-06-20 20:57:00,82,Ive had the best luck with the Mepps Black Fury w/tail and vibrax minnow spin's.  I love my spinners!  which of the 2 I will start with depends on a coin toss I guess! hahaha
86127,misfish,2007-06-20 21:29:00,29133,"Well ,being that saturday it will be all about the kids,I,ll be concentrating on them having fun with what ever were using.Sunday will be spinnerbaits and wizzle worms and craw tubes and jig and pigs and jerk baits."

86129,BabyHerc,2007-06-20 21:35:00,285,Depends on conditions!  Stay versatile!
86131,Tacklebuster,2007-06-20 21:40:00,303,"prob start with my go to:spinner, and then tubes  will be moving around a lot, going for the qaud.: bass pike whities lakers, all within 6-7 hrs.  going to be starting from a somewhat new location so it should be interesting.  Going to have my son with, and he likes it when we move a lot, FASTER dad."
86132,setomonkey,2007-06-20 21:57:00,872,"Spinnerbait to start, and then plastics once we find some good spots...  Mike"
86134,spanky,2007-06-20 21:59:00,195,"just poured up some unsalted senko type baits in a laminate watermelon w/black flake top with a flourescent yellow w/orange flake bottom (perch pattern like), they will be thrown with a weighted weedless mustad ultrapoint hook, from northland lures... with my new stradic and crucial... sadly it will be done from shore as i don't have a boat, but hey i'll catch a few bass i'm sure"

86163,The Urban Fisherman,2007-06-20 22:49:00,2050,"TOPWATER!  As the sun rises over the horizon I'll be chuckin' topwater lures, then I'll switch to my favourite x-rap for a while, then once it starts to warm up a little I'm going to keep the presentation nice and slow, maybe wakey rigged sinking minnow, or a tube for them lazy buckets!  Good Luck! Urban"

86177,Guest Johnny Bass,2007-06-20 23:25:00,0, NICE!!! Thats a really neat looking magazine.
86182,Hookset,2007-06-20 23:35:00,367,"Chug Bug,  then a Sluggo type bait like a Yum Dinger in watermelon or dark smoke. Starting off in a 6"" and moving smaller if need be.  If that don't work, it'll be a 3"" tube in smoke,or salt & pepper, Texas rigged with a small worm weight 1/4 to 1/8 oz.  If they're turned on maybe a spinnerbait in white or firetiger (Sunfish) colour.  It's supposed to be a cold day up here this Saturday so small and slow may be the way to go.  Either way, I can't freakin wait.....   Hookset."
86187,Beans,2007-06-20 23:44:00,3339,I've never fished for bass at Lakair before so Saturday will be interesting...  Torn between throwing a Baby Torpedo or my favorite Phenix tube...  Decisions...decisions !
86208,ecmilley,2007-06-21 00:56:00,2163,"hmmm, spinner baits, texas style worms,senko, x-raps fat raps, tubes, twisters then fishcrisp and beer whose coming?"
86209,mikeh,2007-06-21 01:03:00,824,"topwater frog will be the first bait I throw, can't wait."
86210,JerseyDog,2007-06-21 01:07:00,190,"Some Budweiser.  Well, OK, thats for me.  But then maybe I'll work the lily pads with my plastic frogs & rats or if I get too much Bud in me, I might just try some worms for that 18"" that's been hangng out all spring under my dock."
86213,Canuck2fan,2007-06-21 01:16:00,1444,"I am going to be using real bait. Crayfish if they aren't totally illegal yet. A nice soft shell that I will catch myself making it OK to use as far as I read the regulations will be on my first cast. Hopefully to get the illusive smallie checked off my list of types of fish caught this year in about 20 seconds after I hit the water, if things follow the same pattern as every other year. Since some idiot decided it would be a good idea to introduce large mouth bass into my favorite fishing spot 2 yrs ago after moving about 10 ft I am fairly sure I can switch to a leech for the second cast to get large mouth struck off my list. After that is accomplished I will probably work on using some different techniques by using a modified drop shop type rig with a worm...... Work on trying a minnow under a slip float."
86223,Jigger,2007-06-21 01:46:00,1237,"I'll have a topwater walker on one rod, a spinnerbait on another, a senko on one, a jig and pig on one, a tube rod and a jerkbait rod. I think the first thing I'll pitch will be before daybreak,though, and it'll be a skunk marabou. Theres some Muskie I have to say hello to."
