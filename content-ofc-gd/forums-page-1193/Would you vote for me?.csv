86408,Canada Goose,2007-06-21 17:04:00,6,"The World Fishing Network has the Adopt an Angler contest (lots of Ontario fishers on there) and thought I would ask for a vote from ya. Im a B.C girl and could you imagine the gas I would have to fork out to come get the first prize boat and drag it back here.  So if I won it, I would just sell it to some unsuspecting Ontarioan for $5000 or less   :whistling:  You can vote here - http://www.wfn.tv/rogers/archives.php?page=2 Im currently orphan #15, but with your help, I'll be moving on up in the ranks!

86539,Canada Goose,2007-06-22 00:10:00,6,"  Actually I have been a lurker here and there - mainly when I realized that some of our lakes here were polluted with Bass. I had to come over to an Eastern fishing board to get some tips on how to eradicate them. And thanks to you bass 'tards, I was able to slay alot. So thanks for that.  Do you guys know that other girl from Ontario thats on there? Shes pretty hot and I'd like her phone number, thanks."

86590,RobHall,2007-06-22 01:52:00,261,"I think i'll pass on that.  I'm more needy then you, so i think i'll vote for myself.  I need to get out    more and what a better way then to win an awesome bass boat, a couple of grand to spend at BPS and lessons from a WFN angler like K-Dawg.  Go here to vote for me.  I'm the one with the pic of the tiny perch.  Currently on page 1 (number 11) and living in Ottawa.  http://www.wfn.tv/rogers/archives.php?page=1  My Blog Entry  FOTB "

86660,RobHall,2007-06-22 12:51:00,261,"  Pick me!!  Pick me!!  I am hoping to be adopted by WFN and Rogers Personal TV as a truly deprived angler.  Just imagine how many reports i would be posting if i won a 17' Tracker Boat with Trailer, 2 grand to spend at BPS and a lessons from a WFN Pro angler.  I've never posted a report that actually had a pic of a fish in it.      That must say alot right there.  I need your votes fellow OFNers, to put me over the top.  Read my essay and vote today and every day from now until the end of July.  I'm currently number 36 on page 4 and hoping to move up fast.  Vote Now and Vote Often.  With your help i can finally be cured of DAD.  Help me turn this    into this  http://www.wfn.tv/rogers/archives.php?page=4  -End shamless plug-  Cheers,  FOTB "
