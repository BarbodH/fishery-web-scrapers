86492,dsn,2007-06-21 21:35:00,1018,Met up with urbanangler today again and decided to try for some more carp action. We got alot of hits and misses. But just couldn't get into the big fish. So I took some pics above water and underwater life. Most of the carp we caught were like 3-5 pounds. So we felt it wasn't worth taking pictures of.  Here's some interesting shots of sunfish and bluegills. And ducklings bathing in the sun.               I saw this guy swim by. Hey urbanangler this was the bass I saw swim by.        Good luck to everyone for the bass opener this weekend 23rd?. Always thought it was the last weekend of June. But I was told this weekend. But then again can't remember when fished for bass last time anyways. Always been after carp since I can remember.  dsn
86494,Roy,2007-06-21 21:42:00,13728,"Great pics DSN, thanks for sharing. Can't help but notice the junk people throw in the water thinking it will mysteriously disappear.  Thanks again."
86497,setomonkey,2007-06-21 21:48:00,872,"Yeah, I noticed that too, a coffee cup top, pop can, and ?  Bums me out to see garbage in the water.  Mike"
86498,TJQ,2007-06-21 21:56:00,7806,Coffee tops...  Last winter (some of you may recall) I met two guys walking accross canada.  They said that fully 1/3 of the garbage on the side of the raod was TH coffee cups....
86500,Whopper,2007-06-21 22:00:00,2174,Good pics!  The bluegill just couldn't fan the cup top and the can away.  After a second look I think that a redear sunfish  Whopper
86503,dsn,2007-06-21 22:06:00,1018,Yeah sorry for the garbage. I'll photoshop it next time. But hey if you like the grabage I can always take more shots of garbage. LOL Just kidding. I know its pathetic.  Think of what the sunfish has to do just to make some space. Push all our garabge aside to make room for her eggs.  She must be peeved too. Only if she could talk.  We'd all get it in her eyes.   dsn
86505,Jacques,2007-06-21 22:20:00,97,I think the Bluegill was trying to rrroll up the rrim to win.
86507,mattyk,2007-06-21 22:23:00,2110,why do people throw their junk into the water
86508,fishindevil,2007-06-21 22:25:00,6254,"People just think that the world is their personal garbage dump..  ....it pisses me off to see all that garbage,and where im going for bass opener i will prob be picking up garbage at the government boat launch too....rrrrrrrrrrrrrrr   well thanks for the interesting pics,at least they can overcome all that garbage & crap there and still spawn...cheers"
86513,urbanangler1990,2007-06-21 22:41:00,933,"pretty cool pix, man when did u manage to take soo many pix, lol, thats one nice sized bass!"
86520,dsn,2007-06-21 23:07:00,1018,  I got there before any other body was around and the fish weren't spooked. It was around 7:30am.  dsn
86528,jediangler,2007-06-21 23:44:00,1923,"Nice pics. Tim Horton's should be doing more to show their customers the impact that littering has on the environment. Maybe some of dsn's pics with wildlife and Timmy's garbage in the backround. Hey, that sounds like an idea for a gallery show. Why is it coffee drinkers and smokers can't get their act together?"
86546,Victor,2007-06-22 00:34:00,1609,"Great pics dsn! a fish is still a fish! i don't think you ever get skunked in your neck of the woods eh ..  the garbage is also the first thing i noticed, pathetic indeed ..."
86576,urbanangler1990,2007-06-22 01:23:00,933," hmmm what else r u holding back that i dont know, maybe u caught all the big mamas before i got there huh? LOL"
86607,addict,2007-06-22 02:52:00,475,timmies got the bluegills hooked to eh.damn caffiene
86612,lazybum,2007-06-22 02:59:00,142,Interesting pics and educational too (proliferation of garbage in fish habitat).  Were you using one of those new cameras that are water proof?
86616,Mike the Pike,2007-06-22 03:18:00,3421, No actually thats DSN's new way to chum the fish .Get um hooked on Java pump them up on Caffeine hook em on the line and hang on.  Thanks for the pics DSN .Great shots.  MTP
86668,tonyb,2007-06-22 13:06:00,1637,"$1 deposit on Timmies cups.  I've said it before and I'll keep saying it  If 1/3 of the garbage is TH cups, and there is probably over 10 million pieces of garbage littered in the GTA.  That's at least $3 million dollars worth of refunds waiting to be scooped.  Garbage picking would be a profitable business  Bah! Who am I kidding? Why would TH worry about having to deal with coffee cup returns?  They only thing they want to take in is $$$"
86671,Guest mistyriver1,2007-06-22 13:28:00,0,Nice pics dsn. It is sad to see the garbage.
86680,Bassman27,2007-06-22 13:50:00,98,The duck pics are great.Shame to see the garbage for sure.  BM
