86409,Fishn Technishn,2007-06-21 17:06:00,198,"Judging by the Licence on the side, it is from New Hampshire ? Need to be careful with U.S. boats as some states do not title boats, so would be a nightmare to get it across without proper clear title. I was looking into bringing one across & was told to be careful of this exact problem. Other than that, looks like a great boat! My call would be $16-17 K.  FT"
