86399,Bassman27,2007-06-21 16:46:00,98,That's unreal and would be a little surprizing to say the least.  BM
86406,yellowboat,2007-06-21 17:00:00,211,"Aaron how about a Greenland Shark, heard of the going into Baie Comeau.  Similar colour to what you discribed."
86423,Whopper,2007-06-21 17:31:00,2174,I was on a date a few years back and caught................. oh never mind
86468,Jen,2007-06-21 19:48:00,833,"  That is not a really good one to advertize... I can assure you that your catch when fishing on shore will decrease substantially after a post like that...  (so sorry, I couldn't resist!... )"
86471,cityfisher,2007-06-21 19:59:00,959,great stories guys !! >. that bear pic is insane... you must have tried to get that close.... NO THANKS ! lol
86472,Jen,2007-06-21 20:00:00,833,"I was sitting talking with a group of people last night and the topic of Mud Puppies came up... has anyone caught one, where and do you have pictures?  Cheers  Jen"
86475,tonyb,2007-06-21 20:09:00,1637,Here is a picture of one caught from Nipissing  
86482,Aaron Shirley,2007-06-21 20:51:00,655,"Hey Roy, believe me brother, I know exactly what a sturgeon looks like, and the fish that swam 3-feet from my boat on the Larry was not a sturgeon... this fish was much larger than how big a lake sturgeon can get at maturity.  It was more like the size of a big white sturgeon from the West Coast.  My boat was 16' long, and the fish was longer than half my boat!  Hey Yellowboat,  Thanks for the suggestion on the Greenland Shark.  I just did a bunch of on-line research on the Greenland Shark, and what I learned is amazing.  These sharks are a mystery to scientists and they migrate into the St.Lawrence River every summer!  The Greenland Shark looks very much like the fish we saw several years ago on the St.Lawrence... so much so, that I believe that you helped solve my question on what the heck we witnessed swim by my boat on the Larry.  The Greenland Shark is the best explanation for what we witnessed I have heard.  For years I thought we were both just nuts  That was by far the most rare sighting I will more than likely ever witness in my life.  Greenland Sharks can reach over 20-feet long and over 2000 pounds, and are a brownish colouration. A carabou carcass was found in one shark.  Damn, I'm sure glad I didn't go for a swim!  Here are a few links on the Greenland Shark if anyone is interested to know more about them.  One outfit in Greenland even takes out trips to go ice fishing for them!

86490,Roy,2007-06-21 21:31:00,13728,"""Greenland Sharks can reach over 20-feet long and over 2000 pounds""  Aaron it's even worse, the site says 2 tons... that's more like  4,000 pounds.  Do you remember the story last winter of the woman who caught one ice fishing on the Saguenay here and the press dang near crucified her."
86493,Whopper,2007-06-21 21:41:00,2174," No need to be sorry Jen I deserved that LOL  My sick sense of humor  Shouldn't have made that comment, hasn't been a good day, and for the record I was just kidding.  Whopper"
86512,Clampet,2007-06-21 22:34:00,1947," Yeah, they're partyers on the BOQ.  I caught a fully cooked rack o' ribs while ice fishing on the Rush bar, close to Snake Island."
86529,live2fish,2007-06-21 23:44:00,70,I was salmon fishing in port once and couldnt catch one that day i was almost ready to pack it in when i thought i got snagged untill it slowly sstarted coming in.....I got it up and it was a rod and reel with a salmon on it. I reeled in the salmon and kept the rod:) two in One
86580,John Bacon,2007-06-22 01:32:00,3277,"I have caught rocks, snails, lures, and an anchor.  Twice, I have caught flies; they land on the spool and get trapped when the line wraps around them after I begin realling in.  As for things that I have seen: a mink on shore jumped into the water swam right up to the boat as if it was going to climb into the boat; we stared at each other while I began reaching for a paddle   ... after a few seconds it turned around and swam back to shore."
86644,yellowboat,2007-06-22 11:28:00,211,  Hey Aaron no prob don't thank me though thank the National Geographic Cannel hahaha.
86695,addy79,2007-06-22 14:42:00,573,EEEEEEEWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWW
86698,addy79,2007-06-22 14:48:00,573,"We were fishing Sparrow lake a few years back (maybe 12years) and had a pretty strange thing take place. We were driving (fast) through the middle when we noticed another wake parallel to the boat about 15feet out running alongside us (not behind us enough to be considered runoff from our wake) we stopped the boat and whatever it was kept motoring ahead at a little faster than trolling speed. SCARY STUFF!! no idea what the hell it could've been   ***correction, it was not sparrow lake it was BIG DOE LAKE***"
86783,hydro,2007-06-22 19:07:00,24,"Was out fishing kawarthas last year and my friend hooked, fought and landed a metal twin bed frame!  I'll post the pics later."
86827,Guest Trophymuskie,2007-06-23 00:38:00,0,"Wow some great stories. Been a full time guide on the Ottawa river I'll probably be able to write a book on the stuff I've pulled in off the bottom.  My best one yet was when I was fishing with my son and we trolled by a peer as I was doing a U turn. Well as some know believers like to marry on turns at times so I checked my lines to see if they were ok before they become a tangled mess. I proceeded to check my son's line and it was fine and then when I checked mine there was some weight to it. So I carefully reeled it in to see I had caught some fishing line and some weight. I carefully reeled it all in and grabbed the line to find out it had weight at both ends. I decided to bring in the heavier of the two first and it was a 3-4 pound catfish and the other end was a zebco rod and reel.  Now there was a guy fishing the peer and I looked to see if he looked like someone who'd lost a rod, and even though I saw his rod i decided to go ask as you never know. Well I asked if he'd lost a rod and he said no but that guy has and he points out to the other side of the peer. I am puzzled as I wait for the guy to walk across and i asked if he's lost a rod and he said yes I was fishing the end of the peer at lunchtime and went to get something in my car and when I came back it was gone. Well holy crap it was 5:30 and that poor catfish swam around with that rod for over 5 hours before i rescued it somewhat.  LOL  As a side note we had an incredible day of muskie fishing with 5 fish including a couple of 50+ and when we got home my son could not wait to tell mom we caught a catfish."
86096,muskymax,2007-06-20 19:59:00,21,"Hey guys,  What is the weirdest catch or weirdest thing you have ever seen while fishing?  My weird thing i saw while fishing was a huge bear swimming right next to my boat. It was scary and surreal at the same time.  "
86102,wask,2007-06-20 20:20:00,174,"Wow, that is weird.  That is an awesome pic though. thanks!"
86107,Rizzo,2007-06-20 20:28:00,4754,"yipes, I would be so far gone if I saw a bear swimming out to me.  Bears are bad for fishing don't you know"
86110,Puckhead,2007-06-20 20:40:00,377,"Wow -  I second Rizzo, I would be a little farther back then that...  I imagine it could have pulled itself up on the side of the boat in a hurry..."
86124,walleyedreamer,2007-06-20 21:08:00,101,"this was taken on round lake near fenelon falls. my six little friends when i had my 14 foot mirrocraft. happy fishing, see you on the water, walleyedreamer. IMG_1134.jpg___Image___Photobucket___Video_and_Image_Hosting.htm "
86126,Fang,2007-06-20 21:22:00,1330,Fishing a top water frog in BOQ years ago I had a 4ft water snake strike at the bait and get hooked.  Had to grab hold of the head and work the hook out while the thing is squirming and hissing.
86137,Mattitude,2007-06-20 22:07:00,155,A seagull.  Went right after my Senko and got hooked.  Good times!
86138,gussser,2007-06-20 22:09:00,85,Once hooked a decomposed corpse that some hubby tried to dispose of.  Police had been looking for her several counties away for 5 weeks.   No I didn't take pics.
86140,Motorhead,2007-06-20 22:15:00,163,  that`s just gruesome...  talk about nightmares
86141,Mattitude,2007-06-20 22:19:00,155,I think we got a winner!
86152,steverowbotham,2007-06-20 22:35:00,1800,ummm... gross
86153,mattyk,2007-06-20 22:36:00,2110,that bear would have me freaked out if i saw it. The weirdest thing i ever caught was a huge bull frog. I caught it using a scum frog on some lilly pads.
86184,ccmtcanada,2007-06-20 23:40:00,7971,Caught a seagull with Wolfville manning the net a week or two ago! Was a little disappointed though...didn't put up much of a fight.
86186,fishindevil,2007-06-20 23:43:00,6254,"Well i have had a few weird catches..  ..the best was i acually caught a rock with a hole in it..  ..[it was a piece of shale] from the ottawa river,as well as the rock there was a big freshwater clam latched on to it....anothertime  i caught a rusty boat steering wheel....and man did that ever put up a great fight....it was covered in zebra muscles and pro weighed 15lbs   .....and i once snagged a anchor rope and after getting the rope to just below the surface,i pulled,and pulled and finally it broke free,and i got a nice 7lb anchor,after i cleaned it up it was like brand new...  ...so some of my catches were good.....cheers"
86188,BFSC Kevin,2007-06-20 23:44:00,1351,i would never get so close to a bear.. what if it had tried to climb on.. oh god!
86212,JerseyDog,2007-06-21 01:11:00,190,"Yah, so, I once caught a corpse with a seagull and water snake and an anchor and a '57 Chevy attached while I had a bear riding in my boat and 100 of my buddies swimming beside me.  Forget to add, while my boat was hanging from the bottom of a helicopter with two hands tied behind my back and my eyes taped shut - in Antartica using dental floss and a pencil as a fishing rod."
86232,blairwill,2007-06-21 02:36:00,10,Jersey dog I almost coughed to death. good one.bw
86240,stasbrute,2007-06-21 02:45:00,206,I have posted this picture before old outboard caught with the anchor line on the Ottawa river  
86305,blaque,2007-06-21 11:58:00,2419,"Also had a bear swim by us, but he definitely avoided us, your bear doesnt look at all timid lol. You either were in an area that the bears affiliate humans with food and he wanted a meal, or he was rabid or something lol  Dunno but thats an awesome experience, great pic    "
86341,duber,2007-06-21 14:04:00,220,Caught 3 full cans of Lakeport on the BoQ last Monday.Not as exciting as a bear or a dead body but more refreshing.
86369,Patches,2007-06-21 14:54:00,48,"The only problem with letting a bear on your boat...... They'll drink all your beer and they never chip in on the gas.  Also they always want to change spots, even if you are catching fish, they know somewhere else to try.  ;-)"
86377,Maida_gc,2007-06-21 15:10:00,5," Same here. It was a slow day for me, and I didn't see the giant bull frog as he was under the pads/scum. But I watched as the pads all shook, and the scum started to part and this giant tunnel (scene from Tremors) approached my lure. Then SMASH! I landed it, but thank GOD it spit the hook before I had to touch it.  I'll tell you though, after a slow day like I was having, it was about the most exciting hit I've ever had."
86383,Bigworm,2007-06-21 15:28:00,119,I caught a brand new Shimano rod and real combo this spring at Port Dover. Still had the tape on the handle. I figure someone left their rod unattended and got spooled. I initially thoght I was snagged untill it started to come up. Funny.  Mark
86387,Aaron Shirley,2007-06-21 15:45:00,655,"Wow, that is pretty cool... to be that close to a swimming bear! That would definitely be a wild experience.  The freakiest thing that I ever saw while fishing is something I cannot explain or haven't been able to get a good answer to...  I was fishing on a calm day in the St.Lawrence River close to Lake Ontario in 11-feet of water for perch.  The water was crystal clear and we could see the perch along the bottom.  Then a massive fish swam right beside my 16' boat right near the surface of the water. The fish was so large my girlfriend at the time was shrieking in horror.. and she had hooked and played a 50"" class  musky before.  When I tried to make a cast to it after my initial shock, she started yelling at me (almost crying) to stop trying to catch it, she was so scared.  The fish was shark-like in appearance, approximately 8- to 10-feet in length and a brownish greyish colouration.  It looked similar to a sand shark from 3-feet away.  It's difficult to say just how large it really was as it was in the water, but it was scary big, I know that much.  I wouldn't have wanted to jump in the water!  The only thing I can think of, is that is was some type of saltwater fish or shark that was lost.  I have heard all kinds of suggestions as to what it may have been without any good answer.  I am pretty good at identifying freshwater fish species, and I can say it was not:  - a paddlefish, gar, sturgeon, catfish, musky or any other game fish from freshwater.  Any suggestions?  Aaron"
86394,Roy,2007-06-21 16:14:00,13728,"Dang....I know you know your fish, Aaron but I would still bet on a sturgeon. They swim like a shark and  have a shark-like tail. It's also probably the only fish in the Larry that can grow that long  and could be seen in shallow waters at times."
