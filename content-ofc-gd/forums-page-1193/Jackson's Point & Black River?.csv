86558,John Bacon,2007-06-22 00:55:00,3277,I have a corporate function to attend tomorrow at the Briars resort located near Jackon's point and the mouth of the Black River.  I plan to bring the inflatable kayak and do a little fishing after the event.  What is the fishing like there?  What species can I expect to catch the day before bass season opens   ??
