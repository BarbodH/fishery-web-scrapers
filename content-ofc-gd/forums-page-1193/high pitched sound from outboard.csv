86844,tomkat,2007-06-23 01:53:00,246,My 1999 merc 50 hp 4 stroke is making a high pitch sound at low rpm it seems to go away at higher rpm but it could be getting drowned out by the sound of the motor. The belt looks in good shape so I don't think that is it but hard to tell. Thanks in advance for any thoughts.
