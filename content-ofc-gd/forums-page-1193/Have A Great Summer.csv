I am getting ready to leave on Sunday to go to a summer Job in Quebec... doesn't look like I Will be able to do too much fishing but the rod will be packed just in case  Maybe If I am lucky I will have access to a computer at some point and I might make my presence known lol Either way though I hope every one has a good, safe, and fishing filled summer, good luck to all tomorrow on Bass opener (It will be my last day fishing for 7 weeks lol) and wherever and whatever you may go for in the future... Have a good one guys  Bill"

I will try to get hold of a computer up there... lol but It wont be very predictable as I will be and out of the bush all the time... Ohh and I jsut packed my fly rod, spinning reel and some universal sort of tackle and my fly tying equipment... so if theres water i guess it will be considered fished"
