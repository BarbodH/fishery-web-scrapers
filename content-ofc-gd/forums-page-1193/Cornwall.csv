86333,Seaweed,2007-06-21 13:52:00,135,Work the weedy shorelines for largies.  Try the submerged humps for smallies.  St. Lawrence is a fish factory... great fishing.  Best check some local maps for spots where the old hwy2 runs under the water so that you don't bang up a rental prop.  But close to this shallow shoal is some of the best fishing.  It was flooded when the put in the St. Lawrence Seaway and the various dams.  Once you check out the maps you will be able to find the good fishing and honestly there are only a few spots to watch for the shallow areas... but in choppy water you can get on top of them quickly if you don't know they are there.

86448,wolfville,2007-06-21 18:40:00,396, Exactly !  At least try it at night when you don't fish for other species. Still remember the feelings of my first carp.
