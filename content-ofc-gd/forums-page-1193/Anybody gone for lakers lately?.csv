He caught his first on wire line last year and he's looking forward to spending some time with uncles and cousins. I like to use Williams Wobblers.... any other suggestions? I'll post a report on Monday, Brian"
86338,evster,2007-06-21 13:56:00,367,"I went up to Temagami for the may long weekend and we found the lakers their liked mepps cyclops spoons.  I was using a silver and yellow one and they seemed to always want to take mine over everyone else's (I wasn't complaining).  We had a few caught on medium sized wobblers as well.  We were just trolling with normal line as slow as we could, but the fish weren't more than 20 feet deep so it wasn't an issue."
86357,douG,2007-06-21 14:28:00,2693,Try minnow baits like rebels or rapalas in natural colours.  Smaller cleos and phoebes can be killer too.
86373,Nemo,2007-06-21 15:04:00,727,  Dartees are one of my favs.     Where in Haliburton are you heading to? I will be up on Kashag this weekend trying my luck for LM Bass.
