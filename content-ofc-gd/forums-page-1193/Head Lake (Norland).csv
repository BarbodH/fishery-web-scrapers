Head Lake should be a decent consolation...I've heard good things. I understand the S.East section near the boat launch is good. Muskies, walleye, panfish, etc...   Can anyone confirm this? Any recent visitors to the lake? I'd appreciate any tips...  Hope to post a successful report!   PP"

86740,FishHeadRic,2007-06-22 16:45:00,226,Seriously! Watch out for those rock out croppings! They'll just pop out of no where in that lake. Not really marked at all either.  FHR
