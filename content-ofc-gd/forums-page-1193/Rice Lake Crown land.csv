86534,Stoty,2007-06-22 00:00:00,2910,"No, there is no crown land on Rice Lake. All the islands are owned by someone. Most are owned by the people who's cottage are on them"
86538,Clampet,2007-06-22 00:09:00,1947, Good god man! Think of all those Sssssssserpants! I'd need a heapin' helpin' a granny's shine to face them critters!! 
86540,Lostchild,2007-06-22 00:11:00,153,Lovesick Lake would be a crown land option.
86587,Zamboni,2007-06-22 01:48:00,235,"I have the Rice lake chart scanned in if you want it....no crown land that I've seen. Wonder who owns Tick Island, Railroad ran right over it....that may be Gov't owned.  Interested in camp sites you can boat to myself-my son would consider that a real adventure. Heard some of the islands on Stony Lake are crown land-someone mentioned it here last year."
86593,addict,2007-06-22 02:00:00,475,"cordova lake has a few crown land islands nice lake.fishing is good at times,lots of hammer handles to keep the young uns happy and entertained.lake is located north of havelock its in the road map books."
86717,Aaron Shirley,2007-06-22 15:16:00,655,"If you don't mind driving a little further, Crotch Lake is a camping/wilderness lake that has no cottages, good fishing and many campsites.  There are walleye, pike, smallmouth and perch in the lake to keep you busy, and the landscape is beautiful.  Good fishing!  Aaron"
86737,graftongal,2007-06-22 16:37:00,145,"Both the Hiawatha and Alderville First Nations are located on Rice Lake, so some of the land/islands may be Native owned. I believe in those cases the land would be private property, not crown land.  There are a ton of resorts on the lake, I am sure quite a few of them that offer tent camping. Here are a couple of sites to check out if you decide to go with that option.  www.ricelaketoday.ca  www.ricelakecanada.com"
86741,ADC,2007-06-22 16:46:00,82,"On my way back from Campellford I drove the entire shore on the East side of rice lake and couldnt find a single spot to fish or camp. Its all cottages and private property. On that side it was anyways.  Here is a list of 30+ options... as for which ones have camping... I have no idea but if you find out, please let me know as I havent called around yet to find out.   http://www.ricelakecanada.com/resort_finder.htm   You can also try Catch-More Cottages which is close - its on the Trent. I went there a few weeks ago. Lots of nice people, families and other kids for your son to play with. They have 3 campsites and boat rentals w/plenty of fishing. (but the 3 sites are close to each other and not very private) As well the owners are extremely nice.  Also, you can fish the river right in town on a great cement shore line. You have to drive by it on the way there and back so you cant miss it. We fished there as well, no biggies but after the 40th rock bass I stopped counting.  Between my girlfriend and I, Im sure we caught over 100 of the little critters!  That would be great for the little one.  http://www.catch-more.com/   good luck and please let us know if you find a camping spot on rice lake  cheers"
86855,Pinch,2007-06-23 03:36:00,231,Thanks for all the info everone.  I booked a site for the night at Serpent Mounds Park on Tuesday.  Im sure it will turn out just fine.  Hopefuly I will finally get some fishing in as well!  I'll keep you posted!  Pinch
