I'm hoping it is on the server side somewhere, cause all looks good from here. If we can't find the issue, we do have a total back-up and a new system already on the server ( lucky we were playing with new software, huh?). If this isn't on the server (hosting issue) we'll have it back online next week cause everyone is going to be gone for the weekend. It will take alot of time and coffee to transfer the accounts if we have to, but we will get it done."
