72861,snag,2007-05-18 02:23:00,1932,"Bump (ish)  I had to go to Fort Erie on biz, so thanks to Rick; I made a detour.  I went to Gills for the first and maybe the last time.  I entered the store and felt a heaviness.  Behind the counter was the nicest guy who anyone would call a friend.  During the 45 min. I spent there, I witnessed customers come and make purchases they did not need to make.  Myself included.  (Talk about respect: a parking authority officer even came into the shop and asked if any customers had a van outside that had an expired meter, just so one of Reg's customers wouldn't get ticketed!! I got a laugh when I said that you won't get that in T.O.!!)  You would never know this store was closing for good with such a viberant soul.  I told him who I was and that Rick had posted this thread.  I also promised a bump  There are great deals there from an exceptional person.  I would go for the history."
72897,Photoz,2007-05-18 09:29:00,792,"Personally I have nothing against BPS, but I will never set foot in their store, just because of the lack of personal service & knowledge that these huge 'super-stores' have. I live 10 minutes away from Lebaron's (whose service seems to have improved noticeably lately) so the day to day things I need are bought there, for convenience. When fishing out east, Tightlines or Gagnons, and of course, if I have a large 'need' list, I spend $20.00 on gas & invest a couple hours in the drive to Fishing World in Hamilton. It may cost me a little more, but I know I have a good guarantee on everything I buy, plus up to date & accurate info on what's hitting, and what they're hitting on in the area! I rarely argue prices with any of these places, and I find little need to squabble about a buck or 2 here & there. Just like I wouldn't think of arguing prices of cuts of meat from my butcher, or ask for a discount at my favorite restaraunt! Plus . . . .    to the best of my knowledge, the profits (if any) these smaller stores make, stay in Canada!  P. S.  For you carper guys . . . .    I think Mike at Fishing World MIGHT have a few of the discontinued Technium & Nexave carp rods at DEEPLY discounted prices left from last summer. I saw a VERY few last time I was there! EXCELLENT rods for carp!!"
72937,Shaky,2007-05-18 13:52:00,25,Sad news but I guess thats the way things are going.  I really only go to two places for fishing stuff.  One a small guy and the other LeBarons.  Funny I was so happy when I heard that BPS was coming to the area because I was sick of dealing with LeBarons.  Then the store opened and they didn't carry Excalibur crossbows after making a big point of being in Canada and selling Canadian products.  Glad they carry Excalibur now though.  Anyway that sent me back to Lebarons.  Funny thing happened.  Once BPS was open the service at LeBarons got a lot better.  I avoid BPS if I can and try and give my bussiness to Lebaron or Fishing Depot.  If you fish for muskie BPS isn't much use to you anyway.
73068,fishdawg,2007-05-18 23:31:00,912,I also stopped in briefly yesterday to grab a few salmon items & to wish Reg well in their new venture
73170,cplummer,2007-05-19 16:41:00,165,was in there recently during the sale and picked up some wicked stuff at  VERY reasonable prices..  can't best his prices  right now thats for sure!!  get it before it's all gone i always say!!! cliff...
73235,cplummer,2007-05-19 22:56:00,165,gonna miss the personal service and smiles while in there as well... The big stores  are hard to  shop at compared to the small city guys trying to make a living.. BPS are nowhere near as helpfull nor are any of the big chains ..Sad to see another local business fall.... cliff...
73280,seeking54,2007-05-20 02:18:00,11,"I wonder if the Ma and Pa shops deal with distributors? If so, would it not be possible to bypass them altogheter, and pass on the savings to the consumer? Last year I bought a CMC power tilt and trim unit for my boat . Everyone I contacted quoted me $700 + tax + shipping.  It was a Ma and Pa shop that came through for me! I saved close to $200!!!!!  But what blowed me away, was when I went to pick it up, I noticed the bill was $ 20 less then the price we had agreed. I asked why? He said it came in cheaper than what he quoted me so he passed on the savings to me!!!"
73934,Reg,2007-05-22 13:53:00,2,Thanks to everyone that stopped in during the first week of the close-out. It was nice meeting a few new faces this week like Snog. The biggest loss of closing will be all the great people we have met over the past years. I'll really miss just having a few guys in and telling our fishing tales. We plan on continuing the sale through June (weds-sat) so if your in the Niagara area stop in for a chat and some deals.
80780,Reg,2007-06-07 15:57:00,2,Everything is now 30% OFF the lowest sticker price. Plenty of good stock left.
80788,Terry,2007-06-07 16:25:00,14456,hey would they have a Shimano Calais DC at 30% off I would buy one in a minute
86366,spanky,2007-06-21 14:41:00,195,"welp... they're down to 40% off now with 2 weeks to go... bass guys gotta get in there, lots of good plastics left, including GY senko's... still rods and reels left... tonnes 'o good stuff left still!!"
71812,Sherriff,2007-05-15 13:10:00,252,"Well, this is sad news for sure.  It's really too bad.  The big box stores sure do kill the little guys but this is not only in the tackle industry.  I am sure everyone here has shopped at Zeller's, Can-Tire, Walmart, Price Chopper or The Barn before and these stores have also killed the little guy in the food industry, auto parts, furnature, clothing industry and almost anything else you can think of.  This seems to me to be just the way it goes.  It is terrible for the little guy but we are all guilty of going to the big box stores of some kind!  I do miss the smaller hardware stores since they had better one on one service but most of us rush to Home Depot for hardware.  Couple reasons.  Selection and price.  I try to support the little guy at times but with gas prices the way they are, I NEED to save every cent I can just to keep fishing so if a small shop has something for $100 and the big box store has it for $80, sorry to say, that's where I am going.  The big box store!  Sad but true.  Good luck to all the little guys out there.  I wish you all the best and will support when I can.....  Sherriff"
71823,misfish,2007-05-15 13:22:00,29133,"Well that is sad to hear like everyone else has said,but here theres a local store that is making off the big store.Bad Boyz lures,which is the owner of Simcoe Bait and Tackle as well has his baits in BPS.I can say I dont really shop there that often anymore,personal reasons ,but I give him and his partner credit for keeping the store going."
71844,Fishmaster,2007-05-15 14:22:00,920,90% of your mom & pop shops will match prices ...if they don't have what your looking for they will go outa there way to get it for you to keep the loyal costumers happy my orders can be here within 1 to 2 days ....atleast i no i will try to make my costumers happy guess thats why im still in bussiness after 5 long years of hell but i keep pluggin away and the store is getting fuller and fuller every week ...thanks to loyal people that stay away from BPS
72018,spanky,2007-05-15 22:49:00,195," Thanks for the post Steve, i knew you were heading to see Reg and grab some stuff from him to help out, i know you know your stuff and Reg says the same, i think now that Gill Finigans is gone i will come see you for my big purchases... i've been saying i'm gonna come and see you for a longtime now (i go by Spanky on NFN) and i did when you were in transition but i couldn't find you cause you were in the middle of moving, but i'm hoping i'm about to find some time this weekend (saturday afternoon) to stop by- 1 week before i get married, so i need a fishing/sanity check from all the matrimonial related madness!! lol"
72062,Flywire,2007-05-16 00:31:00,3,I have to say 90% of the gear I have now other than maybe some line here and a lure there have been purchased from Reg. Without his store and the help I recieved from him I would not be fishing like I am today. I enjoy being 19 years old and owning around 3k worth of fishing gear most of it from Reg's store...its definitly a sad thing to watch it go. At least I know I'll be keeping him as a friend and fishing partner for life.
72089,bigbuck,2007-05-16 01:05:00,2449,"I'm guilty of buying stuff at BPS, BUT, I have spent a small fortune at JB's, Tightlines and LeBaron's as well over the past year and a bit. I'm a believer in spreading it around, it's not always about price. I tend to be an impulse shopper and if I'm in the area of a tackle shop, chances are whoever it is will make some sort of a sale. Service is very important, I know that if I buy something at the small guy, he'll take care of any problems without a question. On some items, it's about price. A fishfinder is a fishfinder, if you know which one you want, you go to whoever gives you the best price. It's a big ticket item and price is very important. Help out the small guy, but if he is trying to hose you, he loses. I know that in retail the margins can be quite slim on certain items and on others it is pretty big. You have to be paid for your time, I'm a very firm believer in that. I'll stop now."
72098,Daplumma,2007-05-16 01:22:00,1961,"Honestly,with the internet and the big box stores the little guy is in trouble.As a small business owner(and I do mean small)the only advantage I have over the big guys is service and accountability.I can provide a better service because I am held accountable for every thing my business does and every customer knows me,the owner.My prices are better than most but I cant supply and install a water heater for what Home Depot can but I dont compete with them over those type of price shopping customers.Maybe tackle shops that make thier own lures or have a location that is right where the fish are would do better.Trying to undersell a company that has the buying power of a BP will not succeed.Retail is harsh but it is what it is,buy cheap and sell dear,not exactly a service industry.Dont know the answer and I'm sorry about the place going out of business but the consumer has spoken....and its too bad. Joe"
72676,pigeonfisher,2007-05-17 16:41:00,696,"Sometimes a sad reality.  I work for a medium sized business and own a small business as well.  Keep in mind, being in business of any type that you have to sell what the customer wants.  The products and services that you offer CAN NOT be your choice.  I will rephrase, if you plan to stay in business you must sell what the customer wants.  Some industries sell primarily on quality and service.  Dry Cleaning is a good example of that style of business where people will certainly pay more for different conveniences.  If in the tackle industry the customer says they want to buy at best price 80% of the time and the other 20% of the time they will buy on convenience then you better be making a lot of dough on that last 20%.  Life is full of choices.  Common perception is that when an ideally located business that is offering what you need and selling it a higher price than other stores is ""Gouging the consumer"".  I would tend to disagree, they are located where you need them to be, have what you want to buy and are open the hours that you require to make your purchase.  That is a value.  The tackle store owner should know that the reality of the situation is that you are going to give the majority of your dollars to the company with the lowest price, which he can't afford to be.  Knowing this he needs to make MORE money off you for the luxury or convenience items for which you are stopping to buy.  You and I all work hard to earn a buck.  So does said tackle store owner.  I am not suggesting that you go out of your way to ONLY shop at a local store but for heavens sake, don't cry bloody murder and beg the small business owner to lower his price because you have seen it elsewhere for lower.  Sorry to hear about Gil Finigans going under.  Sam, I wish you much continued success with Cara Outdoors.  Listen to your customer.  If they are using your shop as a convenience store then I would suggest you charge $2.75 for Kraft Dinner and $6.50 for a box of cereal.  I hope that analogy works for you.  Nothing wrong with making money!!!"
