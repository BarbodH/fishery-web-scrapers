86263,hydro,2007-06-21 03:48:00,24,Great fish!  What do you figure on the weight of that one?
86267,[email protected],2007-06-21 03:56:00,25,"It was thick (check out that head...not Mike's head, the musky's) so we were guessing somewhere between 22 - 25 lbs.  She is big but if the one that took that bite out of her tail is still swimming around watch out! "
86271,Whitemikeca,2007-06-21 04:09:00,138,Nice kawartha ski!  Congrats.  You don't it yet but you are about to have a lot less disposable cash.  Once the muskie bug hits you will wonder how you just dropped $400 on lures.
