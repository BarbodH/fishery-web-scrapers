I was thinking of heading out to rice lake on saturday for bass opener. Just wondering if anyone knew where i can go rent a boat. thanks ahead and and goodluck to everyone!"
86430,yellowboat,2007-06-21 17:39:00,211,Bewdely(sp.) docks has a boat rental if I recall correctly  http://ricelakeboatrentals.com/
86431,Dutch,2007-06-21 17:44:00,831,"Try calling and reserving one - there will be many, many people out on the lake.  You don't want to be disappointed in not getting a boat, especially if you are travelling a long way.  Do a search on google - many hits come up."
86446,Stoty,2007-06-21 18:32:00,2910,"Golden Beach Resort (Harwood) has them, as does Harrie Boat Works, and there are  a few places in Bewdley that rent them as well. A couple of the campsites along the Otonobee river (by Benson Bridge) do as well."
86478,Jonaton,2007-06-21 20:38:00,72,"We went out 2 weeks ago without making a reservation. In Bewdley alone there are 5 places we checked out. You can call, but if you don't you can still easily find a boat. We ended up at a place called ""the chip truck"" I think. Weird name but 89$ for a full day in a 16' flat bottom with a 15 isnt a bad price. They had a boat for 69 as well I beleive."
