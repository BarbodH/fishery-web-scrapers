86216,Guidofisherman,2007-06-21 01:26:00,206,"I have been fishing the Nipigon river a few times this year and had the good fortune to catch and release a few each trip. This year I am tagging the brook trout for the MNR as part of an ongoing  study of catch rates, size, location, etc. Already this year several fish have been recaptured and returned to enjoy another time.

86228,Guidofisherman,2007-06-21 02:25:00,206,"Nothing big by Nipigon standards.  I'm heading back there Thursday so ""you never know"".   Actually the MNR is more interested in tagging the smaller, younger fish so they can get a longer history on their growth and movements. Here's a photo of a recaptured fish. "
86229,danc,2007-06-21 02:26:00,4677,"Simply incredible photos Al. Unfortunately I haven't found the time to get out lately, but I'm sure I'll bump into you in August or September some time. In the meantime, keep the photos coming."

86523,Guidofisherman,2007-06-21 23:12:00,206,"After reading a few replies to my original post, I was misleading. When I said I ""worked' for the MNR, I actually volunteer my tagging services. I'm fortunate enough to be retired and get to fish when I want...after the house jobs are done and gas prices drop. I did get out again today. We got 9, missed another half dozen and had numerous follow-ups. Plus the weather was great! Here is an average one on a 5wt. fly rod caught with  a Nipigon strip leech. Alan "
86525,tbayboy,2007-06-21 23:25:00,1497,Loved the photo effects Al - very cool (really love that first one).  Thanks for sharing.
86634,Dano,2007-06-22 10:35:00,719,Nice stuff Guido. I would love to fish that area and actually plan to!
