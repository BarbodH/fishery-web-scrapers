I'm only taking three reels and two rods, but can't deal with the whole bait thing.  I know I only need one lure, but I'm still bringing 50.  That's cause I don't know which lure I need.  Usually,  on the way home, I realize that I never did find out which lure I needed.  Any special instructions or advice before I shut down?"
