86722,silveradosheriff,2007-06-22 15:51:00,1025,Yikes!!!  
86725,douG,2007-06-22 15:55:00,2693,Looks like he might need hydraulic assist to open the lid.
86726,Fishnfiend,2007-06-22 15:57:00,357,"I wouldn't want to feed that thing propane.  Now, if were talking charcoal...  I doubt that would fit on my tailgate though!"
86735,ADC,2007-06-22 16:29:00,82,"Man,  you could cook a Buffalo on that thing!   I wonder how funny it would look when just cooking 1 dog or burger on such a big grill.   Just out of curiosity... how many burgers can you cook on that thing at once?  We should have a contest to see who guesses right. (kinda like the jelly bean jar game)  My Guess would be 65 burgers or 120 dogs or 45 10oz Steaks."
86739,mattyk,2007-06-22 16:44:00,2110,thats one serious bbq.
86746,Kirk,2007-06-22 17:14:00,347,you could barbeque 6 or 7 muskies at once on that grill (assuming 36 inchers [best eating size]) or 4 in the 50 inch class
86747,Terry,2007-06-22 17:19:00,14456,"I wonder how many lawyers you could cook on that          I have never tried eating a burbot  but if I was to, that would be the BBQ to cook them on    Lawyer fish...burbot..eelpout freshwater cods"
86749,wolfville,2007-06-22 17:23:00,396,
86750,Kirk,2007-06-22 17:27:00,347,"I can't believe they'd name a fish as a lawyer but on the bright side at least it's not carp  Cod family...good tasting, another plus"
86752,wolfville,2007-06-22 17:35:00,396," Yeah, thank God ! I might not have liked carp as much, and live release would be a struggle too."
86755,misfish,2007-06-22 17:42:00,29133,"That is one SWEET BBQ. I am a BBQ fanaitic,cook on it when ever I can. Boy I could do a nice indirect heat lemon,dill lamb on that thing and still do all me veggie kabobs and my roasted plum with Italian vanailla ice cream for desert. Now how many will be over for dinner"
86758,Headhunter,2007-06-22 17:51:00,5703,"Saw one similar at the home show, it was around $12,000.00! Really sweet unit, but man for that price... just to cook at carp/turbot? HH"
86806,kemper,2007-06-22 22:24:00,2232,"now THAT, is a grill. I barbeque everything, due party to the fast that its quick and easy to clean up (clean kitchen, happy mom), and also that i find everything just tastes better grilled. Quick grilling tip, try out the new PC Tequila Habenero BBQ sauce, it comes in a huge size for cheap and is VERY good."
86807,silveradosheriff,2007-06-22 22:26:00,1025,Well 2000+ square inches should put you well over 5 dozen burgers.
86812,Clampet,2007-06-22 22:54:00,1947,Chip-Stand!
86813,aniceguy,2007-06-22 23:04:00,1094,dunno how much it can cook but it sure is funny seeing the guy with socks under his sandals.....
86815,Jigger,2007-06-22 23:45:00,1237,Maybe hes compensating for something .
86816,wallyboss,2007-06-22 23:46:00,1095,Good eye Aniceguy!!!!   Socks in sandals  what a DUFUS It's probably his Mom's  BBQ.
86817,aniceguy,2007-06-22 23:57:00,1094,naw more then likely a southern california guy who's idea of a good cook out is some mahi mahi with an articoke glaze seared to perfection on the right side grill  Personally Id like to see a hind of beef on that thing slow cooked for a day !!!!!!
86846,live2fish,2007-06-23 02:05:00,70,thats reality for me guys. When you catch fish as big as i do you need something like that.  Bowen
86853,Hooked,2007-06-23 03:31:00,891,"Man alive, thats is one huge bbq.  My buddy actually has one very similar, just not quite as long, but big enough where it took 3 guys to lift it to his deck.  Needless to say, he chains his down.  I believe they are called 'Silver Bullet' bbq's."
86883,Bassman27,2007-06-23 14:09:00,98,"Holy crap ,that's crazy  BM"
