86681,Bassman27,2007-06-22 13:57:00,98,"I'll be out on my home waters,Bay of Quinte,can't wait although it's goin to be real busy with 2 derby's going on and upwards of 80 boats out there and most should be stayin in the bay and not goin out to the lake as no smallies can be weighed in the first quinte fishing series derby.We'll see if they are near my honey holes  BM  Good Luck all"
86686,duber,2007-06-22 14:15:00,220,I also will be out on the bay .I'm sure it will be a zoo at the launches.  Ya since they got rid of the Lake Ontario smallmouth factor it should mix things up a bit.It will be neat to see what the winning weights will be compared to other years.  Good luck to all!
86713,Golfisher,2007-06-22 15:06:00,586,"My fishing buddy just bailed out on me over work.     It's inhumane, I tell you, a crime against humanity.  Good luck to everyone going out, but leave some bass for the rest of poor saps."
86766,Nemo,2007-06-22 18:06:00,727,I'll be in Haliburton let me know how you do on Kenissis. I sposed to have trout in it too.
86771,addict,2007-06-22 18:13:00,475,have to work opening day.but will be out sunday starting in the wee hrs hope to be on the water by 4am to avoid the boat launch fiascal.hope the heavy sat pressure and cold front dont affect them to much.
86776,misfish,2007-06-22 18:21:00,29133," Thats the trick,get out early and get off early,so you dont have to put up with the afternoon ruckus."
85709,CX-9,2007-06-19 22:02:00,13,"Cant wait for the Bass opener this coming Saturday. Im heading to a Lake around the Haliburton area, i believe its call Kennisis Lake, anyone ever fish there???  And also which Lake are you guyz/gals planning to go for Bass opener   this weekend???"

85719,Hookset,2007-06-19 22:28:00,367,"Oh ya Baby, Been waiting on this day all year. Like every year I suppose... Hitting a bunch of Lakes in the Muskoka's for Smallies and Buckets. This will be the 22nd year in a row that one of my best friends and I have spent the opener together. He's had some health issues lately so this year should be something special. 22nd year....man that's like 5 girlfriends ago and 2 old dogs ago, worth in time.  Good luck all, and be safe.  Hookset."
85794,sunfish,2007-06-20 01:26:00,57,was really looking forward to bass season.  had plans with some buddies to head out to rice lake and rent a boat.  it turns out they might bail out.  good luck to the rest of you!

86005,urbanangler1990,2007-06-20 15:39:00,933,"right in my backyard, whoooohooo cant wait!!"
86012,Stoty,2007-06-20 15:56:00,2910,The best day of the year!!! Can't wait. I already have everything packed up and ready to to!  I will be hitting up my cottage on L/S/C this weekend!!!!  Can't wait to surface fish at 5am....  Good luck everyone! Looking forward to all the posts with the bass reports!! Hopefully I will have one of them!
86027,Kev,2007-06-20 16:58:00,54,I'm going to be fishing Nipissing for smallies.  I can't wait.
86052,walleyedreamer,2007-06-20 18:20:00,101,"catch one for me, as i will be working on my live well again this coming weekend. lol happy fishing, see you on the water, walleyedreamer."
86093,brifishrgy,2007-06-20 19:48:00,559,Lk Erie ... Great Bass Hunt week .... might even get one to enter for team 1
86116,ADC,2007-06-20 20:52:00,82,"oh ya!  I will be going to Lake Eugenia which apparently is known for monster bass ?  However, we will have to see about that.  Ive never been there before so its great to just go somewhere new and explore. I hope its not too busy there.   P.S. - if anyone is going to 12 mile lake and finds a huge bass with a red blue fox #3 vibrax spinner in its mouth..... please let me know as I want my lure back!  Nothing worse than catching a huge bass, grabbing it for a pic and having it jump, slap you in the face and losing it and your lure before the pic is taken."
86130,BabyHerc,2007-06-20 21:39:00,285,"This will be the third bass opener in a row that I'm missing.  Yes, I'm bitter LOL!"
86527,Jigger,2007-06-21 23:42:00,1237," If I catch it, I'm gonna keep it. When did you lose it? I'll be up on 12 Mile this weekend. Ayone else up that way this weekend?"
86531,jediangler,2007-06-21 23:50:00,1923,"Hey ADC, there are some good bass at Eugenia, but it will be crazy at the launch on Saturday. The opener is the only day of the year that they collect cash for using the boat ramp. Once you're on the water there is plenty of room for everyone. I'll be waiting till Sunday to try my luck at home here on the Grand river. When it comes to smallie fishing, why travel when some of the best is in my backyard."
86545,Canuck2fan,2007-06-22 00:31:00,1444,I am going to my favorite bassing hole..... should get done work around noon and head out there at 1 or 2 pm and I know I will most probably limit out before 4 pm at the latest.... I would tell you where it is but then it wouldn't be a secret anymore!!!!
86566,huntervasili,2007-06-22 01:09:00,1604,"Yup welcome to the board... i will be out for sure, at a secret hole not too many know about  OHH I CANT WAIT!!! but only one day then off to quebec for 7 weeks, and i will be fishiong deprived I think"
86646,yellowboat,2007-06-22 11:40:00,211,"Have to go to my Nephew's 1st b-day, we may stop at Island lake for some shore fishing though."
86651,aniceguy,2007-06-22 12:10:00,1094,I ll be flippin some of my favorite laydowns and looking to see if I can find that 7 lb'er that seems to like chompin my jigs but shakin loose
86653,Seaweed,2007-06-22 12:33:00,135,Thanks to the MNR for changing the opening day to Saturday on the Ottawa River I will be fishing it.  Hopefully have a nice report for the board here on Monday.  Best of luck to everyone out there... be safe and tight lines.
