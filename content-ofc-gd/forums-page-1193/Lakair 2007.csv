85418,thecraftyprince,2007-06-19 12:22:00,37,"I finished up all the work I had yesterday so today I'm packing and leaving first thing tomorrow morning for Lakair, it's finally here !! Sadly I have to be back in the big smoke for friday evening but I plan on making the most of my three days. Looking forward to seeing all the regulars and some new faces as well.  If anyone needs a ride up let me know, I know, kinda last minute but I wasn't sure of my departure date til now."
85431,Whopper,2007-06-19 12:50:00,2174,Good Luck Graham!
86434,Shawnow,2007-06-21 17:51:00,1,Big Dumb Cook Allan Rainville no cabin or tent ( live here already ) have boat  Hope everyone ejoyed the food! Have a great time
86496,Roy,2007-06-21 21:45:00,13728,"Allan, shouldn't you be doing dishes or planning supper around this time?   (After that comment I think I'll let someone taste my food for me while I'm up there.)"
86687,Headhunter,2007-06-22 14:22:00,5703,FYI - Salad is not food... it's simply a promissory note of food to come! HH
80577,tjsa,2007-06-07 02:43:00,1578,
80735,Beans,2007-06-07 14:32:00,3339,Nope !  We can talk about happenings but not name names...
80746,John,2007-06-07 15:03:00,2956,"  Tom, Tom............real names are not important. Everything becomes a blurr after the first sip or two...   You won't feel a thing!"
80935,tjsa,2007-06-07 22:27:00,1578," Absolutely no way, is there going to be much of that stuff passing down my gullet!!!!!!!!!   If any. I drink beer, thats it, thats all. I don't drink champagne at new years, hate hard liquor, don't drink shooters bought for me on my birthday(subsequently, no one buys them for me any more, lol), and only occasionally drink wine at family dinners, special events, or weddings.  Ahhhhhhhh, the old ""what happens at Lakair, stays at Lakair"" routine,  I just might need that after my first trip there. Hope not though.  And, I think I already know who that ""lad"" is anyways."
80939,Greencoachdog,2007-06-07 23:02:00,8163," That ""Get Out of Jail Free Card"" may come in very handy!!!  It's all aboot fun!!! and there's no shortage of that there!!!"
80945,tjsa,2007-06-07 23:15:00,1578," Yes, I know that the prime meaning of this event is to have fun, and lots of it. Fishing is the reason for the event, but not the ultimate reason. It's a g2g of ONFC members in one place, at one time, to be able to have fun, get to know new, and old members face to face who will in all likelyhood not ever get the chance to again, at least many of them. Some will be lifers at this event, others, it will be their one and only time.  Still concerned that you somehow know about ""fuzzy handcuffs"" though?????????  And, the ""New Meat"" comment a page or so back is STILL in the forefront of my mind.  (darned banjo music is still there also)."
80960,Roy,2007-06-08 00:06:00,13728,"The trick, Tom, is to learn the attendees real names first. PM them if you have to. There's nothing worse than meeting people a few at a time....you see three guys coming up the trail, you extend your hand and with a smile say ""Hi, I'm Tom, you must be Sammy Smooth Balls and Lick My Armpit, Phat Bassturd."""
80978,tjsa,2007-06-08 01:02:00,1578," Ya, OK, but I would extend my hand and say ""Hi, I am tjsa""  to anyone down there, OFC'r or not, then they would be in the same boat as I am, knowing only board names.  But, thats OK, who cares. I will be on holidays, if Lew isn't really Lew, or Sammy Smoothballs isn't all that smooth, wherever,  it's just a board name, like yours is Roy, even if it is not your real first name, who the heck cares.   You are fishing me right, to find out what my board handle ""tjsa"" exactly means. You came close once, in chat, I will reveal it to you when I meet you, face to face. That is a promise."
81350,John,2007-06-08 17:38:00,2956, Haven't seen SSB around for a while. Is he (oops sorry she) coming up to Lakair?
81480,Canadave,2007-06-08 21:25:00,62,"It's been close to forever since I checked out the site.  I thought I might as well since the Lakair gig must be coming up. Holy sheet !!!  Everything's new and all fancy schmancy.  Hell, it's taking forever for a technopeasant like me just to figure out how to work the damn thing.   I'll bet ol' TJ must be hauling in the loot from showing Sea Doo videos and stuff.  I'll bet these days he's driving around in a V 12 Masarati SUV and out trolling with two of those spiffy new 300 HP Yamaha 4 strokes on the back of his 16 footer.  I can't believe all the newbies who by now must mostly be oldbies.  I thought by now that maybe most of the oldbies would be bored yacking about stupid fish every night and moved on to check out more important things like the hot new porn sites out there or the latest interesting postings on www.rotten.com.  It's good to see that Roy's still around.  He looks so old I thought he'd probably be dead by now.  Living out in the boonies north of the 1,000 islands I still can't get high speed so I'm stuck with snail speed until Sympatico gets caught bribing the CRTC   to not forcing them to provide modern service to this area.  In the meantime it takes forever to download OFC so unless I fork over a bundle to Ripnet, a local wireless ISP in Brockville to bring me into the 21st century there's no point in dropping in to say hello too often.  I might just sign up with them even though by the time they've hooked up all the necessary hardware onto the roof, my house will look like the USS Ronald Reagan aircraft carrier in the middle of the woods.  Hey GaryV!!!  Is that your black lab in the picture?"

First let me say that the blackflies were biting well this last weekend.  Just ask Ruth.  They are getting ready for the tender southern meat.  Tom ... glad to see you are coming this year, looking forward to finally getting to meet you. Just read who you are  bunking with.  My deepest sympathy!  I noticed they forgot to tell you to bring a white shirt.  Joe and Art can explain it.  Don't ask GCD about it, he doesn't own a shirt. lol  13 days to go for us.  Can't wait.  Looking forward to seeing everyone.  Gary, I guess I will just have to stop in and see you and Amy on our way south.  Deg"

79551,aplumma,2007-06-05 11:16:00,6896,  Tom is some pretty stout material but if we finish him off before we leave I guess we can look up our old buddy The Craftyprince.  Hey Glen bring 2 bottles of shine I think we got us another volunteer to amuse us if the fishin is slow.   Art

76568,irishfield,2007-05-29 16:56:00,26272,Based on what I saw on the Smart Craft gauge at WOT...that should last me about 10 minutes. Guess I'd better use the kicker....
76672,BITEME,2007-05-29 21:13:00,1969,Okay Wayne I changed my impeller and got a new prop I should be good for an extra 60mph Pink Slips

77736,Garyv,2007-05-31 20:08:00,547,"Sometimes in life we just have to take the bad with the good. After seeing my surgeon yesterday and my GP today I won't be able to make Lakair this year.  With all the setbacks I've had with infections as well as the drains I still have in me ( and will for the next few weeks yet ) it's not worth the risk.  When you look forward to a trip all fall winter and spring and then can't go it's a bummer.  I wish all of the OFC'RS going the best, have lots of fun, catch lots of fish and with any luck I'll see you all next year."

Guess we'll have to arrange something else on that Sealine reel I promised I'd buy off you when you arrived. NO big deal...I surely don't need it to get thru the season and I don't wanna bother you with it now...just concentrate on getting healthy!"

77857,Greencoachdog,2007-06-01 01:08:00,8163," Twin MOPARS, a fridge with beer, and a ships head!!!.. life don't get much better than that!!!... unless somebody gave ya the boat for free because they felt sorry for ya 'cause ya got's a ""nanorod"" thinggy!"
78094,Garyv,2007-06-01 15:05:00,547,Thanks for all the kind words...I asked Amy if she wanted to go up alone but her drivers license requires a licensed driver to be with her and without me going she's kind of stuck at home.  She's also afraid no one will be able to make her homemade dog food the way I do.

Nothin better than a man with a shine hangover when he thought he only drank a pepsi. That stuff is clear as water and tasteless tom so you will never know when you have been spiked by the Southern Contingincy.   I aint sure whats going to be more fun Tom or the fishin.

But we have been deprived of the real joy that happens and that is the next mornin when they wake up lookin like they had run thru a wringer and put away wet. The bonus is when they don't know that they are drunk because they had a beer or two and decided to switch to Pepsi because they did not want to get to messed up. Well thats were I come in because I will distract you while Glen pours a big old slug of liquid hangover into your can when you ain't seeing it and bang you are on the way to being our favorite comedian.

Dang this hobby is getting expensive  ... now to go tell the better half.    Ha Ha ... she's great.  Letting me come up a couple days earlier ...  hope to get there on Sunday now."

I am happy to report that, as the start of fishing here on May 19, the walleyes have been on a good bite and so the pike... some really nice chunky pike have been caught the last few days...  some pike 30+"" and thick all the way through.... only last evening a crew came in with four walleyes, lined up on the dock, all 25-inches+... that's an unusal event here as our fish are generally much smaller... and they're hitting on worms already... erie-dearies...  Just a note to help us out... when you arrive in camp.. please come up and register so we know who's all here (helps when the wife calls looking for the key to the car).....  Also: we have a 4-bdrm cottage, sitting empty, that can sleep up to eight.  If anyone is interested in bunking in with new (OFC) friends... give me a call....  Please call ahead or email, if you are interested in evening meals to help us plan our food inventory...  Leslie and I are looking forward to seeing everyone once again (and it sounds like there'll be a few new faces too)............  its going to be fun!  the capt"

Tjsa, the rednecks and coonasses are great folks to fish with, and to share a refreshing, sparkling beverage, too.  Dawg's gramma's medicine is a caution, however."
76199,tonyb,2007-05-28 18:22:00,1637," I hear ya douG, I've been missing this trip ever since I knew it existed as it falls on my wife's birthday, we should get a petition going to move it earlier or later by 1 weekend.  I keep harassing her to spend her birthday there but she says 'it's just a bunch of old men going fishing and drinking'  I respond with...'and your point...?'  Oh and Capt...I'll see you the weekend of Sept 22/23  Tony"

70671,tjsa,2007-05-12 00:03:00,1578," WHY, lol  give me sum info, I am gonna be spending time wit dem in a cabin, I need all the ammo I can get, lol"
70674,Daplumma,2007-05-12 00:07:00,1961,"Its gonna be more of the same ol' in that cabin Tom.....you will figger it out! Joe Edited to read:  Reminds me of a joke about a Yuppie (Tom) who made a ton of money in the stock market in the city.  One day he cashed out and moved way out into the sticks. It was a 10-mile drive to the gas station and 15 to the post office and grocers. He lived on 150 acres, went into town once a week, and was at peace with his world.  After a few months there was a knock at his door. He looked out and there was a fat, scruffy-bearded redneck in sweats on his porch.  The Yuppie was happy to see someone and invited him in. The redneck said ""Howdy neighbor, my name is Art and I'm from just up the road and I would like to invite you to a party."" The Yuppie was happy to meet a neighbor and said, ""I'd love to attend.""  Art said, ""I got to warn you that there may be some drinkin' going on at this party.""  Tom thought back to his power three-martini lunches and figured that he could hold his liquor as well as any man and said, ""no problem.""  Art said ""I got to warn you that there might be some fightin' at the party.""  Tom thought to himself that he has never had a problem getting along with people and if push come to shove he had spent a lot of time at the gym making deals and was in pretty good shape so he said, ""no problem.""  Art then said, ""I got to tell you that there may be some sex there too.""  Tom perked up at this statement cause he had been in the country for a while without a woman's touch and said, ""I will be there! What should I bring and what should I wear?""  Art replied, ""Nothin fancy, just gonna be you and me!"" +++ Looking forward to meeting you, Tom."
70681,tjsa,2007-05-12 00:27:00,1578," Uh, Oh, ..........yeah, more of the ""same ol"" but since this is my first time, what exactly is the ""same ol'""  I wanna figger it out ""WELL BEFORE"" I get there,"
70685,crappiesteve,2007-05-12 00:41:00,220,"Guess you will have to wait an see Tom,once up there.  But I would watch out for the REDNECKS:D  Steve"
70702,irishfield,2007-05-12 01:29:00,26272,"Come to think of it, there was some strange sounds comin out of that cabin last year... as it was Dawgs first year. Guess you'z the new meat this year Tom."
70704,bigfish1965,2007-05-12 01:31:00,3382,Why you think douG won't come this year???
70831,Garyv,2007-05-12 16:02:00,547,"  Because he doesn't want to win the ""Deliverance"" trophy two years in a row?"
71122,tjsa,2007-05-13 18:33:00,1578,"  NEW MEAT!!!!! Whadda ya mean ""NEW MEAT"", explain please????"
71152,Greencoachdog,2007-05-13 20:02:00,8163," Relax Tom, ya won't feel a thing after we get a few liquid tranquilizers in ya... er ... uh... I mean ya won't remember a thing... no that's not right either... we're gonna have a real good time... yeah that's it!  We're gonna have a real good time Tom!"
71264,crappiesteve,2007-05-14 02:06:00,220,"Tom.this is only on a need to know  and you will know once you arrive Bud,,,and after the few dats up..you will know  Steve"
71385,Joey,2007-05-14 14:47:00,9122,Just make sure you bring your banjo Tom  And a steel cup so the moonshine doesn't eat through the plastic  Joey

71425,motv8tr,2007-05-14 17:34:00,2587,"Anyone hear from Bcanuck or Ruth and Deg, hopefully they'll be able to make the trip as well.  Maureen"
71456,Daplumma,2007-05-14 18:28:00,1961,Brian has started a new career and doesn't think he can make it but you know how he is...he may just show up anyway!Last I heard Ruth and Don were in but haven't heard from him in a while.He still reads the board so he may reply. Joe
71464,Whopper,2007-05-14 18:35:00,2174,I talked to Don awhile back and he said that him and Ruth had made reservations so I'm pretty sure they will be there. Heck someone needs to stay sober Opps did I say that out loud
71475,motv8tr,2007-05-14 18:45:00,2587,"Thanks guys, I hope Brian is doing well...kinda miss seeing him post...Don and Ruth too...it'll be good to see them...  Maureen"
71630,tjsa,2007-05-14 23:48:00,1578," Well, THAT clears things up,..................NOT!!!!!!!!!!    I think the ""banjo"" would be provided by the southern contingent, regretfully, lol. And the closest that shine is gonna get to me, is if someone asks me to top up ""their"" cup.    T'all depends on what I am being ""tickled"" with. I am sharing a bedroom with the redneck after all, lol.  Thank the Lord Almighty above, that there is a couch there.   p.s.: I am still ""concerned"" about that ""NEW MEAT"" comment. I appeal to everyone who was there last year.................................HELP!!!!!"
71650,Daplumma,2007-05-15 00:14:00,1961,"No worries Tom, Art and I snore but the redneck sleepwalks..and talks. Joe"

67146,Whopper,2007-05-02 21:09:00,2174,   That's just not right

67656,irishfield,2007-05-04 02:01:00,26272,Beats what he caught out of the same boat...but I guess that was the guides fault. 
67884,ccmtcanada,2007-05-04 19:33:00,7971,Cant wait!  Bly and I have our campsite booked.  We'll be there Friday afternoon and leaving Sunday afternoon.

I'm really looking forward to seeing everybody again and meeting new OFNCers. I often daydream about this at work.... being out on beautiful Lake Nippissing... not catching any fish... and coming back in and partying with all the great people of this board!!! Who could ask for anything more???... except to maybe catch a fish  , but the fishin' is only part of it."
