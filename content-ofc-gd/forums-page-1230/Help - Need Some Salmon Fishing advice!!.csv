Despite getting out last year with Steve from Hamilton and Jello for a couple of great outings, at my age, I've only remembered a fraction of all the great stuff they showed me. I'd appreciate some help if somebody has the time. Here's my questions: I've been slowly accumulating Salmon equipment over the last couple of years.  I currently have 3 TDR rods, a 9'6"" MH, a 9' MH, and an 8' ML. I am using a Shimano Tekota 600 LC (new, no line on it at the moment), a Daiwa Accudepth 47LC with 30# mono, an Ambassadeur 6500C4 with 50# PP (Musky Reel), and an Ambassadeur 6500C3 with 30# Mono.  I plan to flatline two rods and run the other two off planer boards on Sunday.  I will probably be using dipseys in the next few weeks, plus I bought an electric Big Jon at a garage Sale a couple of years ago and will run a couple of rods off it later on.  I plan on buying another TDR at BPS tomorrow.  What should I buy? What line should I put on my Tekota?  What lines should I ultimately put on my other reels?  I have a good selection of Smithwicks and Reef Runners and thought I would use those on Sunday.  What colours work best this time of year? Finally, what speed should I be running?  How much line should I let out? Thanks in advance guys.   Its very much appreciated."
