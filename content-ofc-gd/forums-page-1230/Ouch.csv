63251,Roy,2007-04-22 12:18:00,13728,This showed up on the board a few months ago. Don't everyone go getting your knickers in a knot. Think of it as educational. Everything is good for something. Even the town drunk can be used as a bad example for others.
63254,Greencoachdog,2007-04-22 12:38:00,8163,"  FYI, my knickers STAY inna wad!"
