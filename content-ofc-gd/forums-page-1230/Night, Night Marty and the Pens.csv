62506,pigeonfisher,2007-04-20 01:27:00,696,"do we have to cheer for the sens?  They are good enough, nasty enough, fast enough and strong enough.  I have/had a number of signed leafs stuff, they are my boys...but how good are these guys in black and red?"
62522,Dano,2007-04-20 01:45:00,719,It may come to pass. I sat next to a Ottawa season ticket holder at a Leaf-Sabre game who was a true believer that actually argued a strong case for it.
62528,finfan,2007-04-20 01:58:00,44,I'm a real leaf fan at heart as well. But! I do think that the Sens have the team to do it and I hope they go all the way. I actually work for Mr. Melnyk and he really deserves the Stanley Cup. He's been able to keep the team very competitive and he's a great guy too boot! I sometimes think Toronto fans are upset to see that Ottawa can continue to do so well and wish that our leafs could be more like them.
62530,bucktail,2007-04-20 02:02:00,1857,Emery has been fantastic. Great overall team effort. Go Sens...Canada's best chance I think.
62537,brandon,2007-04-20 02:09:00,857,I'm a diehard wings fan but I'm thinkin Buffalo/Vancouver for the final series
62744,blaque,2007-04-20 17:54:00,2419,My Sabres are sputterin too much to go past second round. Thats my opinion
62763,Kirk,2007-04-20 19:28:00,347,Out of habit I'm still going to hope for Sens being eliminated.  The only reason they have for hope is they didn't have to face the Leafs.
62767,muskymatt,2007-04-20 19:40:00,2608,"Great talent , lots of depth and a fast team, very entertaining and I believe they have the heart now.  Sens all the way  Matt the sens fan"
