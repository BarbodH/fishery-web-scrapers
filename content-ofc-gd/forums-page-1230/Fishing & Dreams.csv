62399,dsn,2007-04-19 23:06:00,1018,Do you ever have dreams of your favorite fish? I had a dream recenty that carp where in the areas I fish. And that there is a warm spill coming. I decided to check and see if the carp where in .. and they were!! As for the warm spill well....  . I think I fish carp so much that I'm spiritually connected to them.  I know when they are coming into the lakes. ha ha and where they will be going first.   dsn  Nah the truth is I Got a vision from heaven
62421,Victor,2007-04-19 23:38:00,1609,lol i actually had a dream the other night ... i heard my bite alarm go crazy ... picked up my rod and fish on ... but i woke up not too long after that ....
62432,MJL,2007-04-20 00:04:00,2427,"DSN I'm thinking back to all those times I caught you spawning with the female (or male?) carp in June...NASTY! (j/k)  As far as dreams go, I used to dream about saltwater fly fishing for coho salmon until I punched the wall next to my bed.  Dreaming about double hauling and shooting 90ft of fly line can be dangerous.  I had to bandage my wrist for a good 2 weeks.  THE CARP ARE COMING, THE CARP ARE COMING!"
62464,little angler,2007-04-20 00:47:00,128,i had a dream not to long ago where i caught this huge fish it was at lake Nipissing  i think it was carp and then i woke up not to long after...

62550,007,2007-04-20 02:24:00,537,I always dream about catching that prize fish the night before I go fishing.......  Funny how the night after actually going fishing I always seem to be dreaming about the prize fish that got away!

62731,Zib,2007-04-20 17:13:00,369,"I don't have any fishing dreams that I can remember but this past Sunday night my wife said I was yelling ""Get the Net"" & she looked to see if I was awake & of course I wasn't."
