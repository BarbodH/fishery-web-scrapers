62954,ccmtcanada,2007-04-21 05:23:00,7971,"Well, with the steel in very low numbers in my area, I decided that I still wanted to catch something...anything...as long as it swam!!  Bly and I headed out to do some sucker fishing, since the creeks are filled with them.  A few drifts after we got there, I landed this one.....   Then I had a nice surprise and landed this AWESOME STEEL!!! LOL   Finally, to end the night, I hooked into this one....   It's kind of surprising how much of a fight these suckers put up....they do a pretty good job trying to get away....oh well...until the trout opener, I figure this is what I'll be catching!!  Now...I'm tired...gotta get some sleep...."
