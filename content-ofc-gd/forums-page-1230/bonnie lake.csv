63059,SBCregal,2007-04-21 19:51:00,688,"WOW, that takes me back.... one of my best friends growing up and his family had a trailer there.  spent many weekends up there growing up.  I remember fishing there a little bit, caught a few bass (smallies i think) if you look through the pictures they have on the site there, it looks like theres a few lakers caught there too I havent been there in.... *gulp* 20 yrs probably (wow...that hurts to even think of) but i think the last time i was there, they had a trout pond as well.  let us know how you do there.  I may even book a site up there this summer... for old times sake  Ryan"
