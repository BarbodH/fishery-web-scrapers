What's the closest area with a decent spring sucker population?  No honey holes needed, but something where we wouldn't have to wade or walk through bog (for her sake not mine).  Thanks."

Did a little night fishing tonite (see report)....the waters were so clear, when you got up on the bank to take a look, you could literally see 30 of them in one pool.  Take em all!!! haha."
