Hardly have a clue what I'm doing, but should be a good day anyway.  We launch at 6:00 am and are off the water by noon.  Looking to put the first fish into the new boat! PM me if you're interested.  I work at BPS tomorrow, so if I haven't heard by morning I will have to contact you tomorrow night. "

63086,Corey,2007-04-21 22:05:00,355,So who got busted?  Was at turkey school today and we had a brief visit from the local CO for a few quick words. He mentioned that he had just come from Jordan harbour in regards to a tip from TIPS-MNR there. He wouldn't give details obviously as sometimes in Canada people are innocent until proven guilty.  cd.
