62720,Terry,2007-04-20 16:45:00,14456,"I have seen this many times before and as much as I laughed, I still think it's wrong to have a link to it here if someone has a problem with tree rats I say kill them but many people will say that this is animal torture cruelty to animals and hurting animals for sport...............I hate tree rats and would be happy if they all died, but these were only hurt badly... and we ( this website) should be above that  IMHO...keep this stuff to emails ans PMs"
