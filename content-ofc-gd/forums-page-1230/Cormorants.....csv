I think I read a thread back in the day that said they were going to open a hunting season for them?  at any rate, sucks that they're around!  Cheers, UF"
62227,Terry,2007-04-19 17:06:00,14456,kill'em kill them all
62234,Headhunter,2007-04-19 17:29:00,5703,"There is a huge nesting population living on a and destroying the Leslie Spit. Probably the same flock you saw. They are always out on the hunt for food and nesting material. Kill 'em, kill'em all! HH"
62237,ricoboxing,2007-04-19 17:39:00,398,"would be good to use them for target practice till duck hunting season comes along. doubt they'll have an open season on them though, dam tree huggers and P3TA lovers would throw a fit!"
62262,highdrifter,2007-04-19 19:13:00,2534,"I've my own methods...  MUAH HAHAAH (ringing hands)..  I second that notion.  Migratory bird laws asside, something needs to be done.  Not only are the trees and fishes in geopardy; the local nesting colony of Black Crested Night Herons, one of the largest in North America, are on the verge of having their nesting sites taken right out from under them.  Death to all cormorants!"
62308,lew,2007-04-19 20:38:00,12767,"I only saw about a dozen at Ashbridges this morning, but I spose I was too early to see anymore, but some days the place is loaded with them.  I forget the exact numbers, but it's something like 6000 that were culled down near Quinte a couple years ago, then I remember watching the news about a year ago and they were trying another cull in the same area, but the P3TA groups were in the water near the birds with canoes and nobody could do any shooting with them there.  Never did hear if the cull went ahead after that."
62359,passthepitonspete,2007-04-19 22:22:00,64,"Last spring I was quite distraught to see an island in Algonquin's Opeongo Lake completely taken over by the buggers.  All the trees were killed, of course.  I can't stand the things.  I'd love to see a lot fewer.  But how?"
62440,Pete Maina,2007-04-20 00:16:00,213,"Wow! And I thought I didn't care for cormorants.  Well, on the serious side, I can't say I wish 'em well. They should be culled a little heavier than they are. I'm counting on you folks, cuz I can't."
62448,GbayGiant,2007-04-20 00:27:00,1780,"Well my grandfather is passed away now, so I can say with no worries that he use to shoot them almost every day once they started eating the fish under his dock many years ago.  I'm still young, but I know things were different back then because the neighbours would call the cops and they would show up and have a drink with my grandfather (lemonade of course) and that's about it."
62525,pikehunter,2007-04-20 01:47:00,1659, Ahhh the good old days. Sounds like we have grandfathers cut from the same cloth.
62551,Motorhead,2007-04-20 02:25:00,163,"The only reason there is not a season on cormorants,  is because they taste like SH!^ ..... Had a couple show up at the hunt camp this past summer... Suffice to say, they won`t be showing up this summer....   Doug"
62607,kennyman,2007-04-20 04:22:00,737,Cormorants for muskie bait???????
62696,lilkynan,2007-04-20 15:13:00,173,The Skyway in Hamilton Harbour would be a nice place to start. Lots of open area and lots of targets!!
63040,dsn,2007-04-21 18:05:00,1018,Victoria day is coming lets tie some fireworks to there homes and nesting grounds and light them up like a christmas tree.
