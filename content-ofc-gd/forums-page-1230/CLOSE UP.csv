63101,DMASSE,2007-04-21 23:01:00,420,"How is that Spam  Peole catch fish on Riverside jigs and they mention it in there post....  Peole mention brands of musky baits and thats not spam..what about Berkley, Quantum, Shimano etc etc..  people need to relax....   I bet half the floaters here use some kind of Raven or anglers international products,  they post pics of them, is that spam too    GERRITT  right out of the camera, I dont have photoshop...  Dave"
63109,Gerritt,2007-04-21 23:46:00,6129,"DMasse, I wasnt trying to insult, it is a great pic! Looks cool!  Sorry figured you woulda known I was kidding  Gerritt."
63113,huntervasili,2007-04-21 23:51:00,1604,From the context it seems as if he is actually trying to help out people... would you really rather he kept everything to himself? I know I wouldnt... its as if you tell someone that you caught a bunch of walleye yesterday on an X-rap in clown or something... seems to me he's passing on a tip may of us would be glad to recieve and hopefully would do the same...
63135,DMASSE,2007-04-22 00:39:00,420,GERRITT  wasnt talking to you...  Just tired of saying that everything I post is SPAM   anyway the photo is right out of the macro on the camera...  sounds like team 3 is jealous  LOL  DAVE
63255,Jen,2007-04-22 12:45:00,833,"Way to Go Dave!! Great fish!  Hope you are feeling better soon, very much looking forward to getting together with all of Team ""Up Scalers""  Cheers,  Jen"
