Thinking about staying at Wassi Lodge for 2 weeks - there's supposed to be pickerel, bass & perch in the lake, but I haven't been able to come up with anything on the Internet, so any info would be much appreciated. Thanks, DebS"

63131,DebS,2007-04-22 00:34:00,56,"Thanks njm, You're right, I checked the ON map & it IS spelled ""Wasi"" ( on the guy's website, he spelled it as ""Wassi ).... I see that you're from Powassan. Have you fished Wasi Lake? Just wondered how plentiful the pickerel are & if you can recommend any presentations that worked for you? Thanks for any advice you can give. DebS"
