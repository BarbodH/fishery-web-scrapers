Lake O was nice and calm, these returning birds were a nice sight.      Rob landed the only fish of the day, a nice bright spring Chinook! It was a pleasant surprise as we were only expecting to boat some Brown Trout, thinking it was abit early for Kings!    We had the Yamy trimmed up to try and slow our troll down abit...    A nice view of the old Hotel from the water...    We had another fish on briefly, but alas it ended up being a one fish day...The action will heat up out there soon as the Salmon move in!"

63158,SlowPoke,2007-04-22 01:38:00,2984,"Hey Dax, pretty nice day out there eh?   Shorts and a tee-shirt on ""O"" in April, I was lovin' it. I think we saw you guys near Jordan.... JJ pointed out a boat going by all trimmed up. You guys were still going pretty quick 3.5-4 mph? We had 1 rip each but nothing to the boat. We launched at around 8:30-9 from Port D then went over to Jordan, down to Weller and back to Port D. We didn't see much action around us, glad you were able to get one! -Brian"

63183,Pigeontroller,2007-04-22 02:34:00,2793,"A pleasure as always Rob!   Brian, we did have the motor trimmed up abit, but we weren't doin' no 3.5-4 mph, at times 2.8 maybe, with the motor churning we got it down to 2.2."
