62526,urbanangler1990,2007-04-20 01:48:00,933,"this saturday against the foe of all foes new jersey nets, first round, oh cant wait! im gonna be getting tickets hopefully for the 5th game, it shuld be fun! i have a question about the broadcasting tho, where will all games be aired on?  seaaa of reddd!"
62531,young_one,2007-04-20 02:02:00,620,"lets go Raps! Carter, I'd be scared coming to Toronto!  Possible channel to be aired on. 100% Raptor's TV/ Raptor's HD definitely - Sportsnet East highly likely - Score maybe - TSN Check NBA.com, on the side it usually says which channel will broadcast."
62539,GbayGiant,2007-04-20 02:13:00,1780,"The playoffs are usually covered by the big guys NBC, ABC I think. Man I hope Carter breaks his ankle the first game, and I'm being serious."
62540,urbanangler1990,2007-04-20 02:15:00,933,"yea it says ESPN, but thats national, cant find out what channel local, well i think im just gonna order RAPSTV, altho i think its a big scam and disrespect to fans, just for 1 month, anyway to follow them   hahaha carter, or should i say quitter! cry baby"
62542,xrap,2007-04-20 02:18:00,683,Yea he was a waste of time money and space. They got nothing out of him anyways but it doesn't matter anymore. The raps are finally playing as a team. They play like they did in the regular season then they should have a greta run at the playoffs.
62549,GbayGiant,2007-04-20 02:22:00,1780,"Usually the games are on quite a few channels for playoffs, so we'll be O.K.  You know the funny thing about the actual RapsTV, they don't even show the live games. WEIRD, I use to have the channel and they never aired the live games."
62557,Hooked,2007-04-20 02:30:00,891,"Awesome seeing them in the playoffs again.  They have a very good chance of making the conference finals too!  Who knows, maybe the finals!      GO RAPS!!!!"
62568,fish4me,2007-04-20 02:45:00,59,"The Raptos can beat the Nets, but the Nets can beat the Raptors as well, this is not going to be cake walk,  VC is going to be pumped for this and so will the whole team.  If we lose it will be very disappointing , if they lose you will see that team being rebuilt I think.  This is a BIG and exciting series to watch for those additional reasons."
62606,kennyman,2007-04-20 04:17:00,737,"I can't wait to see CB4 slamming a dunk on VC! Like ""fish4me"" said,it's not going to be easy.This matchup has me both excited and scared. I think they'll be okay if they can hit a few shots,get the first one under their belt and settle down. That way all the young guys can get rid of the playoff jitters and get over the ""admiration and awe factor of Jason Kidd"" (I mean who doesn't respect this guy?). I think in the end they'll win if Bargnani is healthy enough to play like he can and when it comes down to it .... who on the Nets can stop Bosh?"
62614,ecxstriper,2007-04-20 07:38:00,343,I live in New Jersey an d I say kill the nets besides it is HOCKEY TIME .  Come on Wings
62670,Victor,2007-04-20 13:51:00,1609,urbanangler: who told you that there's going to be a 5th game? lol  it's not possible to shut down VC .. but if we are able to hold down the other Nets scorers then it should be okay ... VC isn't kobe after all  ... with bargnani back out i'm sure we'll do fine
62690,cityfisher,2007-04-20 14:59:00,959,Its gonna be a great series.. I say they brake Vinces legs early or stub his toe ...  makes it easier
62692,lilkynan,2007-04-20 15:08:00,173,Rap  tor s - ?????   What is that?
62694,troutologist,2007-04-20 15:13:00,951,check out the top ten list on tsn sportscenter today. A refresher course in why Carter's a joke. Go Raps!!
62697,misfish,2007-04-20 15:13:00,29133,"Ok what is this basketball,is it played with a stick?LOL  Wagon jumping has caused my brian to freeze up. First the leafs,then the pens and next will be the islanders,then it will be the wings,then it will be the sabers.  Then if the raps are still playing,I,ll jump on thier wagon.  All kidding aside,I hope them well. I have enjoyed watching thier games this season.  Sure wish MO would smile more.LOL"
62708,Puckhead,2007-04-20 15:43:00,377,I think someone here said that basketball is that thing that hockey guys sometimes do when their season is over.  So I guess Mats is the center?  Antropov the point guard?  Let's go craptors!
62740,familyguy2005,2007-04-20 17:39:00,1,"Here is the schedule so far. The first game will be on TSN.  The Raps will win, as long as they can get by the zone defence. And the team doesn't forget about passing the ball to CB4.  (3) RAPTORS vs. (6) NETS Gm 1: Sat., Apr. 21 @ TOR, 12:30, ESPN Gm 2: Tue., Apr. 24 @ TOR, 7:00, NBATV Gm 3: Fri., Apr. 27 @ NJN, 7:00, ESPN2 Gm 4: Sun., Apr. 29 @ NJN, 7:30, TNT Gm 5: Tue., May 1 @ TOR, TBD Gm 6: Fri., May 4 @ NJN, TBD Gm 7: Sun., May 6 @ TOR, TBD"
62754,walleyejigger,2007-04-20 18:42:00,876,"not much of a basketball fan but looks like i'll be leaping towards the bandwagon,  can someone tell me what.....  ""onions baby! onions"" means, i hear it pretty often during the games and have seen lots of signs but i have no clue"
62766,urbanangler1990,2007-04-20 19:39:00,933," lol, as the first 2 games all tickects have been sold, im hoping for a game 5, so i can watch them at the ACC, but hey a sweep would be just as good"
62769,urbanangler1990,2007-04-20 19:42:00,933," lol, he means like in end of game situations, or crunch time, and a raptor makes a big play or shot to either tie em, or break the game open or take the lead late, onions meaning like a heartbreaker for the oposing team, makes em cry haha"
62782,tbayboy,2007-04-20 20:26:00,1497,Here you go Chuck Swirski  - all the details you'd ever need on his saying and more
62797,GbayGiant,2007-04-20 21:37:00,1780,"Anyone see the SUN today.      He did have the best in game dunk of all time though during the Olympics when he went over top of this 7'2"" Frenchman and he gave him the Arabian Goggles at the same time.   "
62840,Rizzo,2007-04-20 23:31:00,4754,"Could it be more dramatic??  Would have been nice to cakewalk over the Wizards into round 2 but a victory over ""Wince"" would be just soooo much sweeter (although a loss would truly suck).  I attended 2 Raps playoff games against Philly in round 2 a few years ago and the atmosphere was unbelievabld.  Can't imagine how it will be with whiny #15 back in town...pandamonium I'm sure.  Boo his sissy donkey all the way to the golf course."
