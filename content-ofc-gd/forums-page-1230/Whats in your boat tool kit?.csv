62977,Handlebarz,2007-04-21 11:40:00,3790,I was just going through my tool kit from my last boat it gave me many problems so I had everyting but the kitchen sink now I am down sizing to just the things I feel I need. So I was wondering what everyone else keeps on there boat just in case they might need it maybe I forget something or it may just help someone else out.  I have not finished my new kit yet but will see what I have after and hope that there are many helpful replys before I get done. Yes I understand its Saturay and not many around but still there has tobe some of us not fishing just getting ready today.
