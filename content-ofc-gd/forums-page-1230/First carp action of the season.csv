Cause they weren't feeding agressively. I used the hair rig at the start and just got a quick tug and that was it. The corn was still on my rig. Thats when I went back to the oldfashion corn on a hook method. And it worked.     Even saw some messed up pike from the spawn. Sure hope its tail grows back!! Looks like mold had set in already.   The pike and carp are both swimming together in most places I saw today. Friends  dsn
62857,fish4me,2007-04-21 00:11:00,59,"Nice going and great pics, you showed us whose the carp master.  The bigguns should be coming soon and the action picking up.  Wait for that water to heat up a bit more."
62869,Crazyhook,2007-04-21 00:45:00,1154,"Saw some movement today, should be out some time this weekend!!"
62876,dsn,2007-04-21 00:54:00,1018, If you want to take on the carp at the island let me know. I'll see when I'm available.    dsn
62878,xrap,2007-04-21 00:56:00,683,"Nice shots, thanks for the report"
62879,dsn,2007-04-21 00:57:00,1018,  Feed them bro. Give them some sweets to open up!!  Lets hear those funny reports again. The ones I found weren't inhailing the entire rig today. I guess they are just starting up. So a smaller hook and corn ( as much as you can fit ) directly on the hook did the trick.  dsn
62884,Victor,2007-04-21 01:04:00,1609,wow! seeing these pics are getting me excited!! so they have started eating after the long winter months  i'll have to give it another shot tomorrow or sunday ... thanks for the report!
