62646,Guest mistyriver1,2007-04-20 12:49:00,0,"On our way down to Tennessee, we stopped in at the Cabelas store in Dundee Michigan.  It is quite the place.  The store is huge but to be honest I wish there was more room in the aisle ways.  If you met someone in the aisles with a cart you would have to back up to let them through.  Still a very cool place and well worth a visit.        I think they own the town....   The aquarium was very impressive...     There were some huge catfish...     This one turned out awesome....my new avatar ...   Some more pics from around the store....           A couple of shots from the 2nd floor restaurant...             "
62665,pikehunter,2007-04-20 13:41:00,1659,"kinda looks just like BPS. Nice bunch of pictures, glad to hear you had a good time."
62666,mattyk,2007-04-20 13:45:00,2110,"nice pics, the one of the pike is pretty cool!"
62668,Terry,2007-04-20 13:46:00,14456,another place on my list of things to see very nice thanks
62701,Guest lundboy,2007-04-20 15:21:00,0,"I remember they used to have a live bait room that was about 50'x50', and had the walls lined with Northland Jig heads in bulk bins.  You could pickup a baggie and fill it up with your choice mix and match and it was charged by the weight.  Is that still there?"
62721,Zib,2007-04-20 16:51:00,369," Yes the live bait room is still there.  It's a nice store to visit but they rarely ever have any good deals like BPS does at their Spring Classic. If you go to Cabela's, stay out of the so called ""Bargin Cave"" because there are no bargins to be found in there."
62783,Handlebarz,2007-04-20 20:31:00,3790,  I love the Bargin Cave it depends on what you are looking for I have found some great deals through the years at caballas not just the Dundee one.  I love the Caballas stores over the BPS that I have been to there is another BPS opening in 2008 in Toledo OH right on HWy 75 they just brought in there trailer this week it has COMMING SOON on the side with there logo I can not wait it will be nice to stop in and just pick up a couple things when ever I want with passing by everyday it might be hard to not get into there.  The Dundee store is great and very helpful people there. the tank is alot bigger then BPS in T.O. you can walk through it like a cave. it is worth the visit if your passing by.   Jim had I known you were heading past it I could have let you know where Gander Mountain was and also Jans Net Craft you would have passed both of them. Glad you had a blast there
62796,Zib,2007-04-20 21:21:00,369, Yes the guys at Cabela's are a lot more helpful than BPS. The guys at BPS always want to push the BPS brand stuff on you.Their fish tank is great especially the salmon tank & the Steelhead stream.
62799,misfish,2007-04-20 21:40:00,29133,"I like this pic.   Terry are you thinking maybe a ROAD TRIP???????  I have to agree,it looks like a PBS but to the nines.  Thanks for the report Misty   Hey look out theres a wild beast after you.LOL "
62802,GbayGiant,2007-04-20 21:51:00,1780,"Cool, I like the Rhino VS. L  ion, but the Lion looks to be in a little trouble."
62932,fishindevil,2007-04-21 02:49:00,6254,"Wow very nice ,looks like a great place to blow a grand....   and yes it looks alot like bass pro shops,man i would love to visit there sometime,thanks for sharing those pics and your report...cheers"
