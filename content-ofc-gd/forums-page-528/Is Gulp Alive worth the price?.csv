591528,crossover,2011-06-10 01:20:00,172,"$15 to $20 seems like a steep price from some plastics, wondering if it's worth it as I've never used them before. I picked up a small container $6 for pan fish."
591530,uglyfish,2011-06-10 01:30:00,981,"Depends on who u ask. Some guys swear by them, I personally haven't had much success using it. I like the small minnows for perch and crappie, and know lots of guys who use them for bass on a dropshot, and leeches for walleye."
591533,bushart,2011-06-10 01:35:00,2628,yes
591548,ld17,2011-06-10 02:48:00,319,"I doubt they will work for you cause you seem like their not worth it, and therefore would have no confindence using gulp.  Fishing is all confidence."
591550,Grimace,2011-06-10 02:58:00,2020,"""Fishing is all confidence"" is a statement we hear all the time.  I would like to remind you that the fish do not give half a crap if you are confident or not.  Let's put away this silly statement.  The only thing confidence does is make you feel better using a particular lure as your not getting bit.  Fishing is complicated.  Sometimes it's simple.  As for the gulp, some people swear by it and some people swear at it.   I do a little of both."
591554,dhickey,2011-06-10 03:14:00,1038,Nope. I will never spend another dime on it. 100 bucks and 0 fish.
591556,timmeh,2011-06-10 03:19:00,609,"I don't find it to be very durable. Sometimes 1 fish and it's torn apart and time for a new one. So you can go through it rather quickly.  It's worked for me, but for bass I've done just aa well with other plastics."
591557,GBW,2011-06-10 03:26:00,8460,I have a tub with 4 different ones in it you can have for a good deal.  I have other baits I would much rather use and the Mega Strike sent is GREAT in my mind.  To each thier own...
591559,landry,2011-06-10 03:34:00,1005,It is deadly on crappies Never found it all that great on perch or bass I have tested it against regular plastics for crappies many times when the bite was going strong and it outfished plastics every time. Landry  
591560,2jack2,2011-06-10 03:35:00,92,"I like the bait, I use them all year long, for pan fish, trout, walleye and bass. caught some good fish with them."
591563,radar,2011-06-10 03:58:00,138,"Gotta say I agree with the confidence statement.  I killed bass with it last year.  By far my best year ever.  It gave me confidence to go and try new things when I actually don't have a lot of chances on the water. I think it was actually the ""new things"" that were responsible for the quantity and quality but I sure will invest again this year - actually just bought a small pack of 4"" minnows for some walleye tomorrow.  They go bad fast in temp changes so I think I'll stick to the smaller packs."
591568,adempsey,2011-06-10 04:26:00,1498,"Gulp works for me.  Is it that much better than other comparable plastics, well, I have my doubts.   I like the Gulp minnows, Fry and various panfish baits.  Some of the products have no equivalent that I have come across as well.  So, if you are looking for some type of artificial minnow, the Gulp does work for a lot of anglers based on what I have read on the internet.   However, I am sure there are other products that work just as well and cost less."
591596,mike rousseau,2011-06-10 11:58:00,4661,Gulp works as good as live bait in some cases... Jig head and a worm/ gulp worm... You'll get the same number of hits... But I found they want hold on as long as the real thing...  I keep a tub of 3 inch gulp minnows in my boat for tipping worm harnesses... This works better than live bait cause you get just as many hits but you don't have to re-bait as often ... And tge fish have a hard time tearing the 3 inch gulp...  And last season I landed 2    10lb walleye jigging with a 4inch gulp twister tail...  My 2 cents
591602,backbay,2011-06-10 12:08:00,773,"I use the 5"" leeches, bass love 'em: worth it!"
591630,tributaryhunter,2011-06-10 14:05:00,108," the emerald shinners, black shad, shaky shad and smelts are excellent producers, caught pretty much everything on them, great for steelheading most days aswell, u can fish them anywhich way u want, personally it's all about your presentation."
591646,addy79,2011-06-10 14:48:00,573,"if you can find the 5"" floating leeches, grab em! They work better than any other plastics I've used on a drop shot."
591654,Joeytier,2011-06-10 15:22:00,3990,"If you're willing to put more effort into your presentation than live bait fishing, they work just as well as far as I'm concered."
591660,EC1,2011-06-10 15:43:00,930,"I don't like to buy the tubs, just because they're so damn expensive. Crappies love the 2.5"" minnows though. Can never go wrong with them!  Keep in mind that no matter what, IT'S NOT LIVE BAIT. You will need to impart action to it."
591678,manitoubass2,2011-06-10 16:41:00,11391,"It's worth the cost once you find out what works for what species on what lake, lol.  I usually just buy the packaged version though, and put in a resealable zip lock to prevent leakage.  I love the 3"" and 5"" shad in a few colours for walleye. The leeches and crawlers work well also.  The Chart. 5""minnows work well for me on 3/8 oz. jigs for bass and pike.  A few of the products haven't produced too well for me, but you gotta give em a chance to find out.  Now, if only they made the 3"" minnows with a paddle tail, those would be absolute killer on Rainy river."
591684,SilverCreek,2011-06-10 17:02:00,3,"Not sure about the ALIVE, but regular gulp is fantastic. Floating some 2.5"" Emerald Shiners have got me some VERY nice Steelies and Browns this year."
