591716,adempsey,2011-06-10 18:21:00,1498,"I figured, if canned beans were worthy of their own thread that I might as well pick some up for my upcoming trip.  Never had them before.  $1.27 at my local Wally world."
591722,ketchenany,2011-06-10 18:30:00,3229,  Nothing special! But then that was my FIRST can prepared beans ever.

591742,misfish,2011-06-10 19:18:00,29133, A good 3/4 inch slice of Maple leaf balogna.

She (wife) looked at me kind of, what the  . . . Do you want with those, hey since I'm paying don't ask, OFC thing I hope . . . Us and canned stuff don't go hand in hand but I'll try them eventually and will report the findings.  BTW they were $1.57 a can."

With tomorrow being Good Friday Bush beans will be on the plate with some tasty Crappie fillets...."
575160,pikehunter,2011-04-22 11:25:00,1659,"Why all the fuss over bush beans?  Take some chopped onion, sweet pepper, bbq sauce, brown sugar a splash of hot sauce and a can of any brand of beans you like or what ever was on sale at the store and you will have the best ever. Use your own judgement on the quantities.  Brown half the onion in a spoon of oil, add the rest and the pepper and cook till the onions are near clear. Add the garlic and cook a few seconds, oops forgot to mention garlic, dump in the beans brown sugar and bbq plus the hot sauce. That's it! Guaranteed to set of the the stink alarm anywhere and takes only a few minutes longer than just opening a can.  My son used to call it Dad's special beans when he was small"
