588749,Headhunter,2011-06-01 13:00:00,5703,My family and I stayed there three summers ago for a week. It's under new management since then. What specifically would you like to know? HH
588795,Nipfisher,2011-06-01 15:02:00,2449,I think T.J. knows the owners?
588804,Headhunter,2011-06-01 15:21:00,5703,"Yup, TJ does know the owners... he actually stopped by when I was there on his way to Camp Jiggy. HH"
591888,oxcowboy,2011-06-11 03:01:00,544,"i have been there several times,what kind of info are you looking for?"
591924,vinnimon,2011-06-11 10:07:00,2593,fishing info mainly
591933,Handlebarz,2011-06-11 11:02:00,3790,"There is some good pike fishing there Lots of eye's if you know what your doing and SM are everywhere. My friend owned it years ago but it has since switched owners from what TJ has said the new owners are great.  As for having to go far for fish you don't even have to leave the ""creek"" that they are one its about 2 miles from the Montreal river but it big and there are tons of fish in it I had always thought it was the river its self until Gary told me different.  You can fish from the docks and get pike,bass I don't remember if the eye's stayed there all summer or not but in the spring you can get them from the docks also.  For eye's a jig and chub was all it took If you go there I can give you some detailed spots that were always good for me."
591968,TJQ,2011-06-11 14:40:00,7806,"New owners are great, they are bringing 18 atvr's in to camp today for a ride and a fish fry. Oh and theres no fish up here.. at all.. I wouldnt bother coming up here for the fishing, really, there's none... really.  "
