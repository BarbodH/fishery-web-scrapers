We fish the King of the Lake series, Great Toronto Salmon Hunt, Tightline Tournament(Bluffer's), three Whitby Derbies(lots of fun)and the payeverydayderby. In between tournaments there is lots of pre-fishing. I have all the gear including boat. We are based out of Whitby Harbour where the fishing is fantastic. If this sounds like you, drop me an e-mail and let's talk."
