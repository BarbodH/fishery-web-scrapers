Space is limited, so I'm considering purchasing a travel rod, 6' or 6'6"", medium action, 3 or 4 piece.  Will probably just tack one of my existing reels onto it.  You folks know of any rods I should take a close look at, or have suggestions regarding rods I should waste my time with?  This strikes me as a topic that may have come up before, but when searching for ""travel rod"", 20 pages came up!  I figured that starting a new thread would be the best use of my time.  Thanks for any help!"
