With a front moving through, and a powerful storm hitting the area the previous day, hopes were high that conditions were ripe for a feeding frenzy.  We set off for Carleton Place and launched into Mississippi Lake at 9am. The air temperature was warm (but cooler than the day before) and winds were 10 to 15 clicks. A short boat ride and we were at a favourite spot of mine – a deep, rock strewn shoreline. A few casts in and Christine hoists the first fish of the day in – a jumbo ‘gill. Came on a crankbait. I was working an orange nuckle ball jig and a white, four-inch grub. Working the jig in 8 to 12-feet of water, I scored the first walleye of the day as we passed over a slight hump. It was a small, 14-inch fish. Felt good to get that first walleye in the boat of 2011!  Here is Christine's first of 2011...    For the rest of the report and more pics, check out my blog/website:  http://www.justinhoffmanoutdoors.wordpress.com  Thanks for reading...  Good Fishing,  Justin"

592039,Terry,2011-06-11 21:31:00,14456,good report I have only caught them there after dark on that lake so you must be doing something right
592042,JustinHoffman,2011-06-11 21:36:00,482,"Terry - I really struggle on this lake, especially on the walleye. You get one or two and think you've hit paydirt, then not another fish. Was like this this week. From what I have heard, a lot of the fish suspend in the main basin come summer - trolling with small cranks and planer boards does the trick. Going to head back this coming week. Might fish the afternoon/evening period - see if they turn on more towards dark.  Good Fishing, Justin"
592051,Terry,2011-06-11 22:02:00,14456,"I always came from Perth , so I put in, in a creek on the south west end of the lake, so that's the area I fished most and did very well at night...oh well I don't get down that way much anymore, but I really like the lake"
592073,JustinHoffman,2011-06-11 23:05:00,482,"I know the exact spot, Terry...launch there myself quite a bit. The weedline directly out from that creek is a great spot come fall for largies, walleye and crappie. And a ""free"" launch always beats paying at the municipal ramp.."
