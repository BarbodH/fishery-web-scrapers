591641,fishindevil,2011-06-10 14:37:00,6254,"coboconk was hit very hard,and so was the general area,so you might want someone to check for you..."
591649,fishermccann,2011-06-10 15:10:00,655,"Thanks, a great site for info."
591775,Big Cliff,2011-06-10 22:12:00,6899,"Ok gang, I have to go over to Bean's on Sunday and try to get that tree off his shed, I have a chainsaw but could really use a bit of help. Anyone available for an hour or two? Ok, Ok, might take 3 but we have to get it off his shed before it causes any serious damage and I know Beans can't do it."
591776,Big Cliff,2011-06-10 22:16:00,6899," Simon, as I told you, that bottle will be saved for your next visit. It is far too special for one to enjoy without good company! It is a treasure I will enjoy with he that brought it!"
591795,Beans,2011-06-10 23:06:00,3339," Just got off the phone from talking with both Meely and Cliff  Meely couldn't stand the not knowing so he and a friend took a run up last evening just before dark to find that the ""Manor"" was fine , no power so he lost stuff in the fridge and freezer but other than that ""alls well""...  I thanked Cliff for his kind offer for the generator...at least we could alternate the power from the stand-up freezer and the other fridge in the garage so hopefully our food loss will be minimal...  Quite a 48 hours...cooking and boiling water for coffee on the bbq...watching some old dvds ""The Best of Johnie Carson"" and ""The Best of The Beverly Hillbillies"" on the TV...listening to the ball games and news on radio (battery powered)...  We don't realize how much we rely on electricity, cable and phones until they are not available...  See ya on Sunday Cliff...I threw a tarp over the generator as they are calling for rain tonight...    "
591852,Pikeslayer,2011-06-11 01:25:00,1443, I'm in Cliff. I'll see if I can round up Sean & Troy. I'll call you tomorrow afternoon to confirm details.
591920,Big Cliff,2011-06-11 08:42:00,6899," Thanks Simon but that is a long way to come just for a couple of hours, you'd spend more time getting here than it will take to do the job. Young Brad, the fellow that apprentices with me has offered to come and help if I need him."
591922,Pikeslayer,2011-06-11 09:55:00,1443, But then I wouldn't get a chance to meet another legend. I'll call you this afternoon.  Any Mississauga members here have a chainsaw they can lend out for a day?
591930,Big Cliff,2011-06-11 10:33:00,6899,I have a chain saw Simon
591967,Beans,2011-06-11 14:36:00,3339," I got a chainsaw also...only problem is it is electric and useless in a ""blackout""...  Like Cliff sez...""it is a long way to come just to remove half of a very tall spruce tree"" that snapped off and is sitting on top of my shed...Nice of you to offer...     "
591969,lew,2011-06-11 14:43:00,12766,"I lost a 50' maple in the same storm Norm and just took the final load of it to the local dump this morning. The dumps have been really busy since Wednesday with all the clean-up, but at least their not charging to drop off anything storm related. Don't know if that'll apply to your area or not but I would think so  I figured today would be very busy so I purposely arrived 30 minutes early and there were already a dozen trucks lined up ahead of me. By the time the gates opened at 9:00 there were probably another 15 or 20 behind me."
591972,Beans,2011-06-11 14:55:00,3339,"  I was wonderin"" how you survived the storm...  Lots of good firewood in a maple tree Lew...  Could hear several chainsaws buzzing when I was out taking the pictures...  "
591973,lew,2011-06-11 15:02:00,12766, We actually got lucky this time Norm cause it seems like the powers still out all around us and alot of folks won't get it back till maybe tomorrow morning. Ours flickered a few times but we never lost it for more than 5 minutes at a time.  Good to hear your back up and running again now.  When the big storm came thru here last time we lost  power for 50 hours but I'm wired for a generator so it wasn't a problem.
591974,Beans,2011-06-11 15:05:00,3339, Michael...In the eight years I have lived here I have yet to find a good pickerel spot and as far as our crappie honeyhole...I would have to suffer the wrath of Vinnie (The Chin) and Guido if I divulged it...  I had to take Cliff into it blindfolded and he was driving...   
591460,Big Cliff,2011-06-09 20:38:00,6899,"Talked to Beans last night, his power was out but he was OK. He called me back today to let me know he might not have power back until Sunday. I took my generator over and got him hooked up enough so his fridges and freezer will be OK, he has running water from their pump house on the hill so he is good there. He has phone but no TV or internet right now, the generator can do it but we are trying to run everything off extension cords and don't want to overload things. I left him with enough gas to keep things going for a couple of days but will check on him again tomorrow when i get off work. He could probably use the help of some young guy with a chain saw though, he does have the top of a tree laying across one of his sheads, Anyone want to help? I can supply the chainsaw, gas and oil!  Stopped by CPH's place, no damage to his place but no power either. His mom was there taking stuff out of the freezer to her place so it should be OK. Huge tree right across the road from CPH's looks like it took a direct lightning strike, fortunatly it didn't take out the power lines or hit any houses, it was a big one.  Anyone else in the Kawarthas need me to check on their place or family?"
591465,mercman,2011-06-09 20:50:00,7054,"Cliff, you are one heck of a stand up guy Makes me want to move next door. I hope everyone affected by this crazy weather will be ok.Good on you Cliff   Paul  "
591467,Big Cliff,2011-06-09 20:56:00,6899," Well Paul, the place next door is for sale  Paul in all fairness I don't do anything that most of the OFNrs on this board wouldn't do. Anytime I have ever asked for help of any kind, I have been flooded with generous offers. The best I can do is to try to pay it forward!"
591468,crappieperchhunter,2011-06-09 20:58:00,2582,Thx for checking on our little place for us Cliff. I just got home to find a message from Mom saying she rescued our food supplies.  No power so I guess it's red wine this weekend instead of white when we get up there   The sacrifices we are forced to make to have a good weekend  BTW what big tree? One of those  huge dirty poplars right near the hydro pole? Or one of the nice Oaks across on the neighbors property. I hope it was a poplar.
591470,Joey,2011-06-09 21:02:00,9122,"You're an angel Cliff  Glad everyone is okay, and now they are better because of you"
591471,Big Cliff,2011-06-09 21:04:00,6899,"Steve I'm not sure, I think it was a poplar but I really didn't look that closley, I was busy talking with your mom. Whatever it was it was all blackened near where it broke off, that is why I figured a lightning strike. If you need a generator for the weekend let me know I might be able to borrow one for you to use."
591473,crappieperchhunter,2011-06-09 21:14:00,2582," Very generous Cliff...but we will be fine.  Cook on the BBQ, swim in the lake. It will be just like camping again accept for a nice comfy bed to sleep on instead of the ground.  I might have to pack my coleman stove though. Things might get ugly if Debbe can't have a coffee in the morning"
591475,ccmtcanada,2011-06-09 21:20:00,7971,You are a good man Cliff!!!  So your place fared well I take it?  Do I need to bring work gloves on Sunday??? Lol.
591476,Big Cliff,2011-06-09 21:20:00,6899," No problem Steve but if you are planning on a BBQ for this weekend you might want to bring extra food. I think your mom was getting ready to post a big sign about ""free BBQ"" (or something) LOL."
591477,Meely,2011-06-09 21:23:00,282,Hmmmmmm................ Sent Beans an email last night asking if all was well. It explains why I havent heard back from him yet.....  I cant make it up to the Manor until Saturday....... Now I'm nervous after reading all the news reports.....  Meely
591479,LefroyFisherman,2011-06-09 21:27:00,602,"My parents on Chemong Lake, had about half of a 150 foot willow come down... fun"
591483,Big Cliff,2011-06-09 21:35:00,6899," No, I think we are fine Cliff but thanks for the offer (unless you want to go over to Beans with me and try to remove that tree)."
591486,Garry2Rs,2011-06-09 21:46:00,1425,The power just came back on here in Apsley. It was off for twenty three hours this time. I have learned to keep a few cans of sardines on hand...grin.
591487,motv8tr,2011-06-09 22:00:00,2587,"Cliff, thanks for checking on my folks, I'll give them a call tonight and see how they are.  I lost power last night but had it back by the time I got home from work.  If you don't get enough help let me know and I'll take whatever day off that you are going to be there, and will bring my chainsaw with me.  Maureen"
591492,Handlebarz,2011-06-09 22:31:00,3790,thats awesome of you Clif and like Paul said I would consider myself lucky to live near you.
591495,motv8tr,2011-06-09 23:13:00,2587,"I tried to call them but their line is giving me a busy signal, this usually means they are having problems with their line due to the wetness....happens from time to time, I will keep trying but if you talk to them first, ask them to call me please, I will also let my brother know...  Thanks again Maureen"
591496,Twocoda,2011-06-09 23:18:00,4130,
591518,Big Cliff,2011-06-10 00:59:00,6899, Talked to him a few minutes ago (before I read this) He called me on his cell phone so I think his land line must be out too. I know his cable isn't working. Your mom was out with the girls but he seemed to be doing OK. Don't worry I'll check on him again tomorrow.
591529,Michael_Brown,2011-06-10 01:23:00,411,Nice work Cliff.  I think Beans was planning on posting the locations of all of his best walleye and crappie spots today on OFC.  Maybe you could help him out by doing that for him as well.
591599,fishindevil,2011-06-10 12:04:00,6254,"we got hit hard just up the lake from you cliff,the nieghbors 17ft bayliner was ripped off the boatlift and flipped upside down,and in the lake 100ft from where the boatlift was,it is also upside down in the lake ,there was also several small boats sank as well..lots of dock damage trees down and of course the power was out for almost 24hrs !!! the outboard was a 90 i think its somewhere out in the lake,there was also a few small fires caused by the trees leaning on the wires the fire department hung around all night making sue nobodys cottage caught on fire during the night!! most of the fallen trees are off the roads and stuff,but when the cottagers come up this weekend they will have some work to do for sure...lots of docks are wrote off,and shoreline damage as well...it was bad,but not as bad as the minden area and coboconk,at least nobody was hurt....cheers"
591625,Carp,2011-06-10 13:44:00,1488,"Hope everyone got through the storm without injuries. You're a good man Cliff. If I was in the market for a cottage/home on the lake, I'd scoop the place next door to you in a heartbeat."
591634,fishermccann,2011-06-10 14:17:00,655,"Does anyone know how the town of  Rosedale faired, I have a place on Deweys island and just wondered if the Rosedale area ( west Cameron Lake), has power?"
591636,Pikeslayer,2011-06-10 14:22:00,1443,"Hey Cliff,  I hereby insist that you reward yourself for your outstanding efforts by consuming the balance of that fine Dalwhinnie. I would come up to personally supervise you (and of course help out Beans) but as you know, we are moving Mom this weekend   . to our house for 3 weeks  Cheers, Simon"
