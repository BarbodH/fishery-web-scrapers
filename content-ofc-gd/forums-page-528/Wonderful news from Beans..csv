591780,Big Cliff,2011-06-10 22:37:00,6899,He got hydro and phone back late this afternoon so all is good there. I am still going over Sunday to get that tree off his shed for him so if anyone can give me a hand it would be appreciated! Anyone else need a generator?

591978,Beans,2011-06-11 15:37:00,3339,DANG!!!...I thought I might have spoken too soon as the lights went out again at 09:00pm last night but thanks to whoever or whatever they were back on a half hour later...(PHEW***)  I spoke to my step-son Michael and told him to come around 10:00am on Sunday...Is that good with you Cliff ?
