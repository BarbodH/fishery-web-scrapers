Cheers to both of ya for getting out

592263,mercman,2011-06-12 20:52:00,7054,  Absolutely right My wife and i have had the pleasure of breaking bread with Roy and J on a few occasions.Always treated like royalty.
592041,mercman,2011-06-11 21:34:00,7054,"Met up with Roy at 7AM, and with a couple of Tims in hand, we set out.It was new waters for him, and new technic for me.Bottom bouncing. I have seen the rigs in bait shops, but had no idea what they were or how to use them. Thanks to Roy, now i do. Weather held off just nicely, and we trolled for Walleye along the edge of the shipping channel. I have spoken to alot of the locals in the area, and the walleye bite has been very slow this year. No ones getting the big ones, and they are hard to find.Water temps have been really cool this year and weather fronts have been moving through on a daily basis, causeing the fish to be in unpredictable locations. As it turns out, we spent most of the morning trolling here and there, talking about everything under the sun, and only catching an OOS smallie and a rock bass who seemed to like coming on to lures as big as itself. I enjoyed the time fishing with this experienced angler, and good friend, and i look forward to it again.I dont often get a chance to spend time with experienced anglers Like Roy, and i am grateful for the chance to do that today.  Thanks Roy You are a scholar and a true gentleman.  Paul"
592045,Rattletrap2,2011-06-11 21:44:00,1652,"""Catching"" anything would be a sheer bonus. I think just getting to spend a few hours with Roy in a boat would be a great experience in itself. Sounds like you had that good fortune and then some."
592059,Joey,2011-06-11 22:38:00,9122,"Yep, a day fishing with Roy and it doesn't really matter if you catch anything.  The company alone is what really counts.  Sounds like a great day"
