What we anglers can not agree upon is exactly how they are impacted. Some days the fishing is great so in retrospect you can apply that weather pattern and claim it positively impacted the fish, but then try and duplicate that success on a similar weather day and you will often find yourself scratching your head in frustration. The truth is fish are impacted by weather PLUS a myriad of other influences from weed cover, water temperatures, current, wind and wave action, bait movements etc. So instead of dwelling on the weather good or bad, just go fishing and find out for yourself.  The day after numerous storms rolled through our county, I was able to get out fishing for a few hours with a couple friends. With no power at the cottage we had to “MacGyver” an electric winch to launch the boat, but we were fishing without much delay. The plan was to cycle through my “milk-run” of known musky spots and see if we could coax a musky to bite. We had to wait a couple hours and not until spot number five, before the over sized Beckman landing net got some action. After a couple high-flying leaps, we quickly landed a spunky low 30” fish and promptly released it to go and grow. We fished another few hours, but never had another hit, nor did we see any follows on this slow day. No complaints from the crowd; we were all just happy to be on the water for what turned out to be a pleasant day weather wise.    Tight lines, Andrew  Reds' Fishin' Blog  Pattern: The lone musky was caught casting a jerkbait in six feet of water on the outside edge of a weed line adjacent to a main lake point. All day we focused our efforts on outside weed lines and mid lake rock shoals.  What worked?
