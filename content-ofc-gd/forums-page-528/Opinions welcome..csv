591759,dhickey,2011-06-10 20:44:00,1038,20 horse Merc  1975 This engine runs very well ONCE it starts. Getting it started after a few days of sitting is a challange. No electric start but it would be nice to add it on. My cuzz and I dont have the physical stamina to pull on it as we both have problems with backs and shoulders.  So Im looking for a good marine mechanic that can fix the hard to start problem?  Any sudgestions??  GTA area.  Fishing rod. Im looking to get a decent light -med to add to my collection .   Any sudgustions? 80.00$  MAX..  ??????? Thanks. saltydawg.
591762,Carp,2011-06-10 21:01:00,1488,"I had a 1975 - 20 hp. Merc from about 1985 to 1995. Ran like a clock. Took 2 or 3 pulls of the starter cord to get it going after it had been sitting for a while. If it was warmed up, it would usually start on the first pull.  There's a marine mechanic in the west end of Toronto that worked on outboards for my friend & I. He used to do quite a bit of work from home, but I'm not sure if he still does.  Check your pm's for his name & number."

BTW, if you're considering any marine mechanics in Burlington, pm me. There is a specific company that you need to be aware of."
591940,docknocker,2011-06-11 11:37:00,36,"  Old trick I've used for years on small engines,Give a couple squirts of Ronsons lighter fluid into carb 1st Give her a pull, she will probably start right up. This will work in a pinch,But will not ""fix"" whatever the true problem is. Regards SteveO"
591950,fishnsled,2011-06-11 12:09:00,3520,If you are looking for someone in the northern GTA area then Discount Marine would be a good place to go.
591954,Billy Bob,2011-06-11 12:37:00,5865, I would recommend this as it will wash the cylinder walls of oil that a 2 cycle needs for lubrication.
591997,docknocker,2011-06-11 18:32:00,36,"  Thanks for the back up BB I have actually found this to ""Cure"" the problem but was reluctant to state it. Glad to see someone else on the same page! SteveO"
591999,docknocker,2011-06-11 18:43:00,36,Salt Dog I'm almost too embarrassed to ask BUT? Have you pulled the plug/s checkeg gap?? and made sure there are no carbon deposits? I'm sure you already have so please disregard these suggestions...........? Steveo
592002,docknocker,2011-06-11 18:58:00,36,"  Lube will be replenished as soon as engine running on supplied fuel(mix) Before that only spark plug fouling and flooding will occur. Lighter fluid will clean out fouling and supply PURE gas/naptha. No added ingredients. Worked for me for years And made me the ""Wizard"" Give it a try and let us know/ SteveO"
592077,dhickey,2011-06-11 23:09:00,1038,Thanks for your replies.  Call me old school but a properly set up engine should not need to be tamppered with in order to start?  Unless your standing in -40 degrese..
