Was a pretty good day, just fishing for crappie and such with worms as bass seasons are not yet open in my region. But boy was I surprised when that bobber sunk under and I reeled into in a 4 pound largemouth on the other end!( Which I promptly released of course). Anyways, good fishing to all of you"
