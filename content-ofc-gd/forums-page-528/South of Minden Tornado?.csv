591256,chris.brock,2011-06-09 00:54:00,4053,Does anyone know any details about the tornado south of Minden?
591257,GBW,2011-06-09 00:57:00,8460,was it close to Coby?
591258,chris.brock,2011-06-09 01:01:00,4053,"no, just south of Minden, from Hunter Creek to the south end of Bob Lake"
591259,GBW,2011-06-09 01:03:00,8460,My dad lost 4 tree's and has no power on 4 mile lake right now.
591263,JeffBornFishin,2011-06-09 01:12:00,260,Local news said they expect hydro crews in the area to restore power within 4 to 5 days  they showed a few shots of the bridge area..a lot of damage.  I suspect that the Minden through Irondale area got about the same.
591271,Terry,2011-06-09 01:43:00,14456, I don't think he lost them  he knows where they are   they are now just vertically challenged.......    :rofl2:  sorry  I do hope they didn't hit anything
591280,GBW,2011-06-09 02:14:00,8460,true.  the 1 fell and blocked the road and the others fell in the yard.  the 1 was cleaned up ASAP so they could get in and the others are going to be cleand up tomorrow.
591354,irishfield,2011-06-09 12:34:00,26272,From what I saw on the news... none of those trees came down from a tornado.
591407,fishindevil,2011-06-09 15:57:00,6254,"we got hit hard on sturgeon lake in dunsford,the nieghbors 17ft bayliner with a 90hp is upside down in the lake,lots of docks ruined trees down too,we might have power by late tonight....dam this is the second time this year alone !!!!! grrrrrr"
591635,ehg,2011-06-10 14:20:00,2666,"Yup, saw on news yesterday that the wind damage in the area is from a microburst not tornadoes after Enviroment Canada sent teams to survey damage. Still sounds like lots of trees down right through the Kawarthas etc..."
591915,Sinker,2011-06-11 04:56:00,8692,"I got to see it from the water. Let me tell ya, I've never seen a storm appear that quick. She was dirty. I was lucky to make it to shore in time. I wish I could have taken pictures of the boat ride to shore. Just crazy!!  S."
591918,dhickey,2011-06-11 05:26:00,1038,  A valuable learning expierance. Happy to hear every thing is ok.  I hit 8 to 10 ft with rouge waves a few years ago. Scared the hell out of me. Kilarny.
