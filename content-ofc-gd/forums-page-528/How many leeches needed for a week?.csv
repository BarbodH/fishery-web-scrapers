591712,10point,2011-06-10 18:14:00,165,How many leeches would you buy for a week of walleye fishing?
591717,manitoubass2,2011-06-10 18:23:00,11391," Depends on where and how your fishing them?  If the lake is full of good size eating walleye, I'd buy lots. If your targeting larger fish, well, I'd still buy lots, lol.  Buggers are expensive though, at least in my neck of the woods.  Maybe a mix between real leeches and some Gulp Alive leeches?"

591724,John,2011-06-10 18:33:00,2956,I know a couple of places where you can stand chest deep for an hour or so and you will get as many of the little buggers as you need...
591732,Michael_Brown,2011-06-10 18:45:00,411,One Chuck Norris leech will deplete the walleye population in any lake otherwise go with Roy's guess.
591740,manitoubass2,2011-06-10 19:08:00,11391," This had me laughing  I can see it now, Chuck Norris signature lures, ""spinkicking fish into submission since 1983"""

591751,ChrisK,2011-06-10 19:47:00,2772,I'd go with about 4 dozen leeches but then again I  drag worms when it comes to northern walleye so I'm into about a dozen worms per evening due to the little nibblers...Sirloin of the north always seems to work for us better than leeches in June and July.
591794,misfish,2011-06-10 23:03:00,29133," That reminds me of the movie""Stand by me"""
591796,irishfield,2011-06-10 23:06:00,26272,Wouldn't need any in my boat....
