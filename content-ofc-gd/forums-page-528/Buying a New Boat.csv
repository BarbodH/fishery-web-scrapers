590970,lookinforwalleye,2011-06-08 13:01:00,4399,Rivets!Rivets!  another good reason to check out Alumacraft I had one and it was a solid boat!  I believe a wise OFC`er once said there is a reason why they don`t weld aircraft...now who said that?
590979,Fish4Eyes,2011-06-08 13:27:00,1022,Get a Lund or Princecraft and be done with it. Why even risk your safety and hard earned money on a brand that has been known to create problems.
590982,bigbuck,2011-06-08 13:31:00,2449,"Alumacraft makes a nice hull and boat. Comparing apples to apples, I found the Alumacraft a bit nicer inside than a price comparable LUND. Go take a look at them and see if it compares to the Legend. And, don't get less than 75% of the rated power for the hull. Max it out if it's in the budget. If you plan on going out into big water, get a kicker, if your main engine breaks down, you will be in trouble especially if a weather front moves in. Safety comes first. Get a smaller boat with a kicker if your budget does not allow for it in a bigger boat."
590987,doubleheader,2011-06-08 13:42:00,497," No question, an Alumacraft would be a better built boat but I'd check the deadrise for sure because many of them are pretty shallow and it sounds like you want to fish the big water. Between your choices I would lean to the Fishmaster. That boat is designed for big water. Now I don't know about the Canadian market but a 150 Verado in the US is very competitively priced to a 2 stroke, especially when you consider the additional benefit of the digital throttle which is really sweet. That said, I wouldn't plan to troll extensively with any big 4 stroke any more than I would a 2 stroke. Pick up a kicker motor. I know, more bucks but if you fish the big water enough you'll be glad for the back-up motor plus lots of other reasons to avoid using your big motor. Fuel economy between the 2 and 4 stroke is essentially a wash. I'm running a 200HP Verado now, my first was a 135HP, both are great motors, and I would highly recommend them if you have a trained Verado mechanic nearby. Not that you will need one, but every motor experiences some proble sooner or later."
590991,dave524,2011-06-08 13:54:00,4508," I'd get a 2 stroke for a main and a kicker. You need to watch the total weight hung on the transon with some hulls. Slightly less cost for a 2 stroker will help pay for the kicker, the fuel saving of trolling with it will pay for the rest, total weight of that combo will be close to a large 4 stroke. I came in once on the kicker from way offshore, teleflex steering cable broke while trolling on the kicker, disconnect the ez steer, 8 mph on the tiller of the kicker sure beat any other option alone out there"
591039,jedimaster,2011-06-08 16:23:00,3472,"Alumacraft, Princecraft, Lund are the top 3 brands imo. And whoever said the thing about aircraft welding and rivets is a smart man. It is not possible to cnosistently weld alluminum without weakening the material around it. Especially in a factory stamp em out scenario."
591044,Billy Bob,2011-06-08 16:39:00,5865,"I don't agree with a kicker...my fishing buddy had a 18.5 Lund with a 115 hp Yammy for the last 15 years and we always fished Erie and Ontario with it without every having any issues....he just traded in that boat and his smaller 16' Lund for 17' Polarcraft but kept the 115 hp Yammy for the back of it...it's quite and dependable plus it sips fuel like a 2 stroke kicker...  I see no reason for two outboards to fish the so called ""Big Lakes""...my 50 hp Johnson has never failed me in 26 years of fishing Erie and Ontario...and I had fished the NYS walleye tournaments every year when I was younger....so yes I did a LOT of offshore fishing...10 - 12 miles out or more."
591049,Fish4Eyes,2011-06-08 16:54:00,1022," You should be thankful you or your friend never had a problem. But in the event you did have a problem with the motor, you could be in for some trouble seeing as conditions can change in an instant on the big water.  I agree with the kicker as a back up incase the big motor dies, and for the simple fact that its easier on the wallet to replace a kicker that has been used mainly to troll, rather than wearing out the big motor from trolling and having to replace it. This especially holds true if your buying brand new and don't have intentions of upgrading anytime soon."
591057,Billy Bob,2011-06-08 17:15:00,5865," I do see your point....but with a 20' boat with 3 or 4 guys and gear, not much a 6 or 9 hp kicker is going to do anyways....you're going to be out there a LONG time....I would rather depend on my GPS and VHF radio, not to mention a cell phone...TONS of guys are out fishing the ""Big Waters"" without kickers....I wouldn't get too hung up on that option...IMHO...  You also have a good point saving wear and tear on the big motor...but as said...my buddies 115 hp Yammy is now 18 year old and he only used that boat for trolling the Great Lakes because he also had the smaller boat...but now that motor will do double duty as he got the in-between-er boat so he only has to deal with one boat now."
591059,Cast-Away,2011-06-08 17:22:00,790,"It is funny how people are so quick to throw certain companies such as Legend under the bus.    Their hull issues were back in the early 1990's and they changed vendors for their hulls after all of the problems. I own a 2000 17 foot riveted Legend that was built by Smoker Craft who also make Starcraft and Sylvan. To the best of my knowledge these are all quality boats as is mine.  Jedimaster, i did Google your two searches and came up blank, so perhaps more research is relevant in the future before giving a company a bad name in a public forum?"
591071,troutologist,2011-06-08 17:53:00,951,"Take a close look at the hull design and thickness if you are planning on fishing big water. Sooner or later you will get caught out in it, also its nice to not have to limit your days fishing.  I can tell you that the Lund IPS hulls are about the best on the market, they keep you dry and handle big water very well. Have a close look at the 1950 Tyee and the 1875 Impact Sport. They are a lot of boat for the $ and are finished well inside.  Just got back from a tournament this weekend and we ran 22km north into a north wind that was 30-40km. Glad I was in a Lund.  When comparing motors, take into account the cost of servicing a Verado, which, if I'm not mistaken needs to be done at the dealership for warrantly (not certain). This brings down the cost of the Opti further. On a side note the new verado pros are nice....and fast!"
591101,irishfield,2011-06-08 18:52:00,26272," Absolutely not. I let them do the first oil change to look for metal. There is nothing mysterious about looking after the Verado compared to any other engine. Now if you have any computer issues, you're gonna be looking for a facility with the required computer and program to scan and set limits. If it's running fine... it needs nothing but oil/filter changes upper, oil change lower and fuel filter inspect and replacements when necessary. There are two.. ones a water seperator and the other the fine filter. Check the alternator belt and you're good to go."
591106,Terry,2011-06-08 19:13:00,14456, I was real glad I had my kicker on Saturday as it got me most of the way back to the ramp before the big motor started working again.....thank you 5 hp honda
591198,Billy Bob,2011-06-08 22:31:00,5865, That's good....but I would rather keep one outboard maintained then 2...everyone is different....nice you had something to keep you going in the right direction....
591203,danbouck,2011-06-08 22:43:00,4380,I guess I should sell my legend....
591270,Terry,2011-06-09 01:39:00,14456," just got it out of the shop on thursday, so you can't get more maintained then that   shistuff happens  and a kicker is a great thing to have...(for me) and I am glad I had it even to my main motor was just maintained by arguably the best outboard mechanic in Ontario.....  I see lots of brand new cars broken on the side of the road and new boats being towed in"
591282,ctdd2006,2011-06-09 02:20:00,531, How much?
591333,Billy Bob,2011-06-09 10:37:00,5865, Yep....you pay anywhere from 20K to 50K for a new car or truck and not one of them comes with a kicker.....  Just having a bit of fun at your expense Terry.....
591411,Another Canadian,2011-06-09 17:05:00,41,"If you like the Legend hull, but not the motor, look for something else.  When I bought my boat back in 2001, I liked the Princecraft but it was owned by OMC then and I did not want the OMC motor (FICHT) that it came with.  I ended up buying a Smokercraft with a Honda 115 on it.  It is 18' feet long and rated for a 150.  Boat was OK powered, but best was 42mph with a low pitch prop to help it get out of the hole.  Insurance was used to buy a new Honda 150 and the boat is far better with the Max hp.  A 20' boat with a 175 rating needs a 135/150/175 class of outboard on it.  By my quick calculation, you are looking at $35k+ for a new boat.  Don't compromise on the Legend, and get the boat/motor/trailer and accessories you want, not what they are willing to sell you.  If you start comparing apples to apples, the Legend is not always cheaper when you shop around.  There are dealers that will sell you want you want and will negotiate on price to make the sale.  PS- Legend also had the length of my boat as 18'8"" where Smokercraft had it at 17'8"".  Depends on if you measure the centreline of the boat, or the gunwale length.  Somehow my boat also is 18'8""."
591482,jedimaster,2011-06-09 21:32:00,3472,"There are all kinds of people happy with there trackers as well, but you throw that brand under the bus. No offense to anyon that owns either. Speaking from my personal experience and people I know. A Legend is not a brand I would consider or recommend. It comes as much from the the fact that I would never touch a welded alluminum hull as it does a particular vendor. I am very glad that your rivetted Legend that as made by another company is good, as I understand the boat he is looking at has a welded Hull and I would steer as far away from that as possible."
591509,RickOnt,2011-06-10 00:16:00,669,"Hey Jedi  Right On!!  I had a '94 Legend 17'8"" with a 115 Mariner. The Hull was made by Smokercraft and was riveted.  It was a great boat and the only issue I had, was the front livewell, that was welded, split on a run up in the Verendyre Doswere to get away from a storm.   As for the OP I would go with the Opti!!!  Very little noise or fuel consumption difference to the 4 Stroke and Lighter and Less $$$$.   On a 20' boat you need a 150HP.   Rick"
591572,OutdoorDan,2011-06-10 05:38:00,325,"All,  I wanted to thank you for input. I'm in the process of digesting everything, there are many opinions and factors I have to weigh here. I'm definitely taking my time because I want to get it just right.  Also thank you to those who have been kind enough to PM me and help me out!  Dan"
590730,OutdoorDan,2011-06-07 22:33:00,325,"Hi all,  I recently made a thread about towing the new boat that I am planning to get. Thanks everyone for the help! I've made the decision to dock the boat at a marina for at least this year, then later on either keep it docked someplace if that suits me, or upgrade vehicles.  Right now I am deciding on a boat and I am somewhat stuck at crossroads, mostly because of outboard decisions. It's between a Legend 20 Extreme and a Starcraft 196 Fishmaster. I like the 20 Extreme more and it comes with a smaller price tag even with an upgraded motor, but things turned out to be very complicated.  As far as I understand, the 90 Merc ELPTO which the boat comes withis way too underpowered for the 20 Extreme. So, I can upgrade to either the 115 Merc 4 stroke, or the 150 Optimax. I want a four stroke so that I can troll for salmon and not use a kicker, because it's quieter, less maintenance and I will be burning less gas and won't be burning oil. However, I think the 115 4 stroke might be underpowered for this boat. With the 150 Optimax, I'm sure I will get enough power, but I assume it will be much louder, less smooth, and I won't be able to troll with it. Legend won't put a non Merc on the boat, and the Verado series seems way expensive.  The Fishmaster comes with a 150 Suzuki four stroke. This suits me fine, but I like the Legend boat more aesthetically, and it's about 6k cheaper even with an upgrade to the 150 Optimax. It also comes with more features and is more of a complete package.  Can you guys give me some opinion and input? I feel a little lost. If I could confirm that the 115 4 stroke isn't underpowering the 20 Extreme, I would go for it, but I don't have experience in the area. Most of the time it will just be a few small guys in the boat, but sometimes the boat will be packed full with people and equipment. I'll be using it on Georgian Bay.  Thanks a lot,  Dan"
590735,DRIFTER_016,2011-06-07 22:53:00,10439,Dan Talk with the Ledgend people and see if they will put a 4 stroke 150HP on it. They are pretty easy to deal with. I bought my boat off them in '91 and had them change a few things and had no issues.
590736,lookinforwalleye,2011-06-07 22:58:00,4399,"90 is way underpowered for any 20 footer unless it`s a canoe, 115 still underpowered in my opinion 150 just about right!!!  If you go for the 150 you will be needing a kicker for trolling especially with an Optimax, I have read trolling with an Opti is not good for it. As far as noise goes my Opti is only slightly if at all loader than a four stroke and fuel efficency is on par or better than a 4 stroke."
590743,OutdoorDan,2011-06-07 23:15:00,325,"Drifter,  115 is the highest HP that Merc makes in 4 strokes. Except the Verado series, but those are very expensive: a 150 Opti with a Pro Kicker would be cheaper than a 150 Verado.  lookinforwalleye,  Thanks for your input! my thoughts were much on par with yours in terms of power, unfortunately. I had no idea that and Opti would be up there if not beyond a four stroke in fuel consumption though. I guess that will be made up with the oil I will need to put into it though."
590754,smally21,2011-06-07 23:30:00,993,"a new 4 stroke isnt going to get much, if any, fuel savings over a new 2 stroke. that may have been true when 4 strokes first came out but a modern 2 stroke is remarkably fuel efficient. same problems with noise and trolling however. the 20 legend wouldn't be a dog with a 115, but might not light the world on fire. i like the idea of the biggest motor you can afford with a kicker...."
590761,Bernie,2011-06-07 23:44:00,3190,"A 20 footer with a 115 will be a dog. Loaded up with people, fuel and gear will need a smaller prop to get it to plane within a reasonable time. This can sometimes lead to more fuel consumption. IMHO the 150 would be the minimum."
590773,Dutch,2011-06-08 00:17:00,831,"I know I'm not spending my money on this, but that boat is rated for a 175.  Anything less than a 150 would be a problem.  I question the ethics and logic of any boat manufacturer that sells that outfit standard with a 90HP motor.  It is in no way adequate and I would even suggest it is dangerous.  I hate to rain on your parade, but I don't like legend boats at all for crap like selling boats underpowered.  Cheers to the guys that have them and like them, just wouldn't find me in one."
590777,OutdoorDan,2011-06-08 00:24:00,325,"I agree that it is ridiculous that they sell their boat underpowered, however in terms of overall quality they seem fine and as a few dealers told me are made by Smokecraft anyways. Clearly it's their angle (selling underpowered boats to create the illusion of huge savings) but as far as I'm concerned they can do whatever as long as I'm aware of all the issues and can solve them.  As for raining on my parade, I welcome that. I'd rather hear a lot of criticism an make changes while I still can!  Thanks,  Dan"
590782,Bernie,2011-06-08 00:40:00,3190,"You may find that if you really do some comparisons with different boat company's with all things being equal with HP, aluminum thickness and options you will find a better boat for the same price."
590783,irishfield,2011-06-08 00:41:00,26272,I think I just heard someone say Crestliner.....
590785,Pigeontroller,2011-06-08 00:46:00,2793,"Seriously, go to Bay City Marine in Hamilton. Price out an similar Alumacraft with a 4-stroke Yamaha..."
590786,Bernie,2011-06-08 00:46:00,3190,No ads Wayne. Just trying to help the guy. Notice I said nothing about an E-Tec.... :
590790,irishfield,2011-06-08 00:49:00,26272,"Bernie!  I was surprised to see that they dropped the 150 Merc from the ""normal"" 4 stroke line... as my F-in-law has one on the back of his pontoon boat."
590793,Bernie,2011-06-08 00:52:00,3190,"Yes, may have had something to do with emissions standards. Although we did end up with a bunch of new 2 stroke 20 Mercs this year. They went like hotcakes."
590797,dave524,2011-06-08 01:00:00,4508,I'd really rethink the kicker if you are going out offshore on big water
590851,OutdoorDan,2011-06-08 01:59:00,325,"Hey guys,  I'm really appreciating all the input. As you can understand, I have a lot to take into consideration and am extremely confused by the amount of information I have to process. Irish, I took the Crestliner hint and will research those boats, as well as Alumacraft as suggested by Pigeon.  To help everyone help me, what I need is a 19-20 foot boat with a full windshield, a full height rear splashboard, and it has to been deep inside. One of the reasons I was looking at the Starcraft Fisherman and the legend 20 Extreme was because they are 31"" deep inside. Having a full top would also be good, but not a necessity.  I'm likely not being open minded enough considering all my options, but I am taking my time with this and I am certainly not locked into one of the two boats I mentioned in the OP. They are just ones that I am considering strongly at the time because they seem suitable, if I come across something better through your suggestions I won't have trouble changing my mind. By the sounds of the general consensus of this board, Legend isn't the greatest way to go. Please don't think that by saying this you are ruining ""my parade"". On the contrary, I would like alternate suggestions so I can make the best choice.  Thanks everyone for the input so far,  Dan"
590882,danbouck,2011-06-08 02:46:00,4380,You will be happy with a legend
590895,jedimaster,2011-06-08 03:21:00,3472,"I am surprised anyone would recomend a Legend with all of the well known hull problems and warranty issues people have had with them. I won't receommend a brand, of either boat or motor because I don't think you asked for it. What I will say is this. What ever the boat is rated for is what is should have. Otherwise you will end up wishing you had a bit more juice. Put it this way. If you want to run 50 mph. This is the only way you wil be satisfied by throttling down and cruising in it. What you will end up doing is running WOT most of the time if your not maxxed out. Also for safety sake if your fishing big water, get a kicker. Also with big water if you need to get up and off the lake in a hurry  you wil appreciate the extra few MPH you will get out of a bigger motor. I can't recall every seeing a thread where someone wanted to downgrade the size of there main motor do to it being too powerful or too fast.  P.S. Lund with a Yammy is a nice combo."
590909,ld17,2011-06-08 04:16:00,319," Where is this info well know?  I bought a small legend and have had no problems with it.  For that matter I see lots of them while fishing and some of them are old models and they seem to be working fine.  If the legend boat is the boat you like and it has what you need then half the battle is over.  As for what motor to get?  As others have stated get the max or close to the max you can afford.  You can never have to much power.  Good luck with what ever you end up with.  One last thing I will add is, make sure your happy with the dealer. I've talked to some and they don't seem to know much about the boats they sell or have an attitude that is not very appealing.  If you don't get the service you want then go else where."
590915,jedimaster,2011-06-08 04:57:00,3472,"Just google legend cracked hull. Or legend class action or even search on here, lots of people have had issues with them. One of my good freinds also had a legend and it split right down the keel while out on simcoe. And 18 footer. It got fixed and he sold it. Thankfully he was close to shore perching. He was able to beach it. I don't think it would have actually sunk, but when water started gushing in it was a bit of panic time. The problem with the welded hulls is area beside the weld can get weak if the weld is done too hot or something. Maybe they have worked out these issue but I wouldn't ever touch one."
590917,irishfield,2011-06-08 04:59:00,26272,Are you confusing C(T)racker with Legend Jedi???
590918,OutdoorDan,2011-06-08 05:07:00,325,Those I know for a fact I need to avoid - I've read up on that.  As for brand recommendations I'm all ears as long as they make a boat that meets my specifications... Although I am getting the feeling that it's against forum rules to mention specific brands?
590922,BFSC Kevin,2011-06-08 06:11:00,1351, I agree. You should look into getting a kicker motor to save the hours off your main engine and the kicker can be a back up to get back to shore if anything happens to the main!
590960,Uncle Buck,2011-06-08 12:33:00,1000, Ditto!!
590963,jedimaster,2011-06-08 12:42:00,3472,"Tracker is even worse, but the legend welded hulls have also had some real bad reviews."
