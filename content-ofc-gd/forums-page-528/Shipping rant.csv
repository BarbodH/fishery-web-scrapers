I don't ship much and when I do I use Canada Post.  It's easy, it's inexpensive and I have never had a problem with it.  I am now trying o send a 20 lbs box to Quebec.  I've done the online quote with the big companies (four of them).  By using Canada Post my parcel would be around $15.00.  UPS is $40.00, Puro $35.00, FedEx and Canpar are both $19.00.  Try Fed Ex first, 10 minutes on the phone as I do not have an account.  They then give me an account number and tell me I have to go online to do a pickup.  I'm already talking to you, lets get this done?  Nope online only, plus a $6.00 a week surcharge fee.  Pass.  Try Canpar.  On the phone for another 10 minutes with them, once I figure a way to talk to a human without having an account number.  Online only is the responce I get from them.  So I go and start an account online.  My computer is slow as molasis, so I am getting frustrated quickly.  Get my info entered.  Next page says an agent will call me in 48 hours.  what the hell, I just talked to them on the phone.  I cannot get an account without talking to them, but I have to do it online.  I'm not even going to try with the other two, as they are too expensive.  I cannot wait till I can trust that I can waddle across the street, put stamps on my box and have it delivered.  GRRR, talk about frustrated."

591744,cranks bait,2011-06-10 19:28:00,721,"Just talked to my mail delivery person.  She said there should be no problem sending it Canada Post.  Might just take a few days longer.  Especially now that they have been told that they are going to be locked out on Tuesdays and Thursdays.  She has not heard of a complete hault yet, so I am risking it.  As for going to the hub.  Wish I could.  I work longer hours than they are open so getting there is a problem, hence the need for pickup.  Plus they are on the other end of town.  For now though I am glad to be able to just cross the street."
591787,irishfield,2011-06-10 22:54:00,26272,Dicom Express.. cheaper than Canada Post ! I use it for all my aircraft part orders out of Brantford. $11.70 for Canada Post and I have to go chase the damn package at the postal outlet with a 3 day delay. Dicom Express gets handed off to Orillia Messenger service up here and Paul brings it right to my shop door the NEXT morning for $8.40 !!!
