I tried to get a hold of a friend for a day out for chinnies, well there was no answer, Fine. So instead I went to price out canvas for the bow of my boat, ouch!!! After that I decided I will check out an antique shop that advertisized fishing lures. So off I went across the street not knowing what I would find. I searched the first Ilse, and theres wasnt much there Then I spoke to the clerk, he took me back where they all the were  I didnt have the time to go through it So I figured I would recheck the first Isle before leaving and I seen these two penn boxs hidden. I opened them up and tested them, made a deal with the clerk And now their mine A very nice fellow by the name of Tom, Thanks a ton Mint shape, all the paper work and orig reel wrap with penn logo, tools, grease, boxs in pristine shape Spooled with steel wire on each of them. Its so shiny, im afraid to use them."
