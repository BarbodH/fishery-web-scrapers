591856,Lionized,2011-06-11 01:31:00,19,I feel like I'm cheating when using regular worms. I'm definitely cheating when the worms glow in the dark!  Whatever they're feeding them to turn florescent Green must not be good for them?  Maybe I should call P3TA or Pamela Anderson? : )
591858,mercman,2011-06-11 01:33:00,7054,"what in the name of all thats holy, are you talking about"
591859,Roy,2011-06-11 01:38:00,13728,I didn't know they still sold them. They made a heck of a mess on everything they touched.
591860,irishfield,2011-06-11 01:40:00,26272,It's just Kryptonite in the soil of Blue Mountain's worm farm... nothing to get alarmed about!
591871,Rod Caster,2011-06-11 02:08:00,5784,Maybe the worms are getting sick.  haha I haven't seen them yet this year.  
591899,PikeMolester,2011-06-11 03:32:00,428,That stuff is pretty old. I forget what its called but I found a can of it (stuff turns the worms glow in the dark) here at the lodge I'm working at. Looks messy
591901,BFSC Kevin,2011-06-11 03:44:00,1351,nitro worms they were called
591902,Handlebarz,2011-06-11 03:49:00,3790,Heck about 8 years or so ago they were on clearance  at WM for about 50 cents I bought them all 10-20 packs they did turn the worms green but I did not see any difference in catching walleye. I did sell them for $1 per pack years later at a yard sale so it was not a loss LOL
591917,adempsey,2011-06-11 05:12:00,1498,"Lol, I just saw a bunch of this worm food on clearance at my local Canadian Tire.  The one I saw was made by Lindy.  I bought green worms in the past just for kicks and I really don't think it makes any difference .  Just another gimmick."
591925,Rich Clemens,2011-06-11 10:08:00,3131,You can still but them down this way - never used them though.
591927,limeyangler,2011-06-11 10:14:00,5204,"Nitro worms...they still sell them up here...agree with the holy mess they make. I tried them last year on my idiot bass lake (i.e. the bass are so easy to catch, even from shore with a slip bobber and worm, even an 'Idiot' can catch 'em......lol...that would be me) and they did make a huge difference. The difference being even when it was a fish a cast as soon as i offered up the nitro worms not a bite to be had!"
591982,EC1,2011-06-11 16:24:00,930,I actually feel that they were pretty good! It's like having the colours from an artificial bait and putting it onto live bait! Haven't used them since I was 12-13...so it might have just been a kid's logic. Lol.
592033,Muskieman,2011-06-11 21:01:00,2472,"Gimmick..  I tried the ""Nitro""  same difference... My wife hated them....  She knew when I used them... cause when I'd get home.. I walked straight into the laundry room anNITROed everything I wore into the washing machine..  I agree with the messy part as well.. the carpet in my boat is still stained after 2 seasons.   Randy "
592148,PikeMolester,2011-06-12 03:18:00,428,"please refer me to this ""Idiot Lake"" you speak of"
