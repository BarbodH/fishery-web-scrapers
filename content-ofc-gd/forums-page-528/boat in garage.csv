I need to store it in a standard subdivision double car garage with a single door.  must fit on an angle.  Since these garages in suberbia all have similar dimensions I was wondering if anyone on the board owns a boat in excess of 18 feet and parks it on an angle in their garage.  If you do, brand and model would be great to know.  I realize you can get boat dimensions and guess but I am curious what the max length somone on the board has fit?  Last thing I want to do is buy one and realize I missed it by an inch.  Thanks in advance."
590447,muskymike,2011-06-07 01:22:00,772,"A standard garage on the new houses is typically 20' x 10' for a single and 19'-11"" x 20' for a double car. That should get you started. Swing away tongue on a 19' may fit, 20' boat you are pushing it."
590458,dave524,2011-06-07 01:33:00,4508,"Don't forget a bigger boat is higher too, my 18 ( actually 18' 5"") Sylvan is a squeaker in height , centre console with a grab rail around the windshield. I don't know if you will really gain much in size. A Starcraft 196 Fishmaster is one of the biggest aluminums without breaking the 20 foot barrier , might be a thought with a folding tongue on the trailer.  http://www.starcraftmarine.com/Showroom/Specifications.aspx?TypeId=37&SeriesId=130&ModelId=969&Type=Fishing%20Boats&Series=Fishmaster&Model=196"

590975,ryansusanna,2011-06-08 13:23:00,27,"Just do what i did.  build your house and garage around your boat   19'8, fits straight in with the transom saver off.....(24 feet all said)   In all seriousness you can likely go a tad bigger, but i think the single door is going to be your biggest pain in that equation."
590977,smally21,2011-06-08 13:24:00,993,"if the boat fits the trailer properly a swing tongue does little for you. my 18'boat is 24' tip to tail on the trailer and doesn't stand a chance of going in the garage. at over 8 feet wide the angle doesn't do much either, its not like it tucks into the corner. and with the console windshields on its over seven feet tall and wouldn't fit undet the door. i guess in my experience the standard garage just wont take alot of boat. others experienmce may vary. good luck!"
590981,rob v,2011-06-08 13:29:00,535,And if your double car garage has a partition like mine (two garage doors) you're really euchered - won't even get in the door !
591136,workwear,2011-06-08 20:03:00,592,before i bought my boat i laid out a floor plan right in the garage....it fits on an angle with bout 4 inches to spare...i have a single door double garage....my boat is a 1900 pro v with a fold away tounge...its just a pita to get the right angle when storing it....has to be pushed by hand....i think my next boat will be a 17' ft'er....ive been looking at the 1750 tyee...what a sweet looking boat...oh and by the way check the height....i have to take my windsheild off when i park it...grrrrrrr
591144,OutdoorDan,2011-06-08 20:17:00,325,"Is the garage door 92""? A lot of the 19-20 foot boats I have looked at are 96-100"" at the beam."

591416,jedimaster,2011-06-09 17:18:00,3472,My 16'f lund fits in my garage end to end. I just need to take the motor cowl off and tile the motor all the way forward and turned fully to one side.

591567,love2fishhave2work,2011-06-10 04:18:00,212,some helpfull pointers.  I like the idea of a 19 foot pro v.  Exactly what I want.  Just need to take proper measurements.
