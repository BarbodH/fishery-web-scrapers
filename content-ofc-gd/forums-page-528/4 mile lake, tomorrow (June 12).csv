So I'm going to my folks place on 4 mile lake tomorrow and I should be there just before lunch.  So if anyone that hasn't fished the lake and has a boat and would like to follow me around in my boat feel free to PM me with your info.  I'll show you where to go and try.  Sinclair already stole the one seat in my boat when he noticed my status update, but I can fit a 3rd in a tight space if you want to come too.  Let me know if you are interested.  Geoff"
