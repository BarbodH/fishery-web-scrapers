I have never fished the lake and I have heard mixed opinions on the quality of fishing in the lake.  I have heard some people tell me there is musky in lake Joe. Is this true?  I have had other people tell me there is no musky in the lake but that there is pike.  I want to know if its worthwhile bringing my musky gear or not.  Also is the pike fishing any good?  Just looking online I dont see much re pike in the lake, just bass and lake trout info.  Thanks in advance guys!  Mike"
591656,goteeboy,2011-06-10 15:30:00,175,"Yes, there are musky in Joseph as well as medium to large pike.  I had a beast follow this past Monday.  My guess it was a musky and not a pike as the back was more brown than black.  Last year, landed a very long, but very skinny muskie.  My partner landed a 9 lb pike and lost one close to 12 or more lbs this Monday.  If you need more info PM me.   "

591673,Whitemikeca,2011-06-10 16:29:00,138,Thanks for the info guys.  I received a few PMs as well.  Seems the consensus is that musky are not worth it on Lake Joe.  I will try and focus most my efforts on laker fishing (which I suck at) and if I get bored with that I will probably throw a few musky baits to get some exercise.
