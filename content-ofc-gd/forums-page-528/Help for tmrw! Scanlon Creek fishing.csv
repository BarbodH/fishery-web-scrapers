Doing a birthday for a friend tomorrow (June 11) at Scanlon Creek and no one going has ever been there before. How is the fishing there? No one going is a hardcore angler or anything, so even if its okay fishing, and everyone can possibly catch a fish, that'd be nice. Also, the weather reports says its raining, is that going to hinder my chances of catching anything?  Would appreciate any and all comments  Thanks in advance  Andy"
