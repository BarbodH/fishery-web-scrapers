591341,Homer Is King,2011-06-09 11:41:00,305,It nice to see some fines being handed out. Conservation through enforcement is the answer.  Here is a link to the MNR website with a bunch of other charges that have been handed out. http://www.mnr.gov.o...L02_164545.html  There are some good ones! $1 000 for a having a spawning walleye $6 000 and loss of license for over limit on rainbow and salmon $50 000 for importing Asian Carp

591381,fishindevil,2011-06-09 13:56:00,6254,"i as well was there the same day fishing when they got nailed !!! im sooo glad...and i know the boat,the color,so i will be watching...i live right on the lake as well..."

591424,ehg,2011-06-09 17:58:00,2666,Finally evidence that a call to MNR TIPS line is followed up. Have heard too often of people calling and there being no response. Think that the offenders have to be quite blatant for anything to be done.
591453,coreyhkh,2011-06-09 20:14:00,163,What happens to the fish? does the MNR take them?
591457,jedimaster,2011-06-09 20:33:00,3472,"Just a reminder to people that when you do catch fish you need to package them so they can be redily identified and counted, as well you need to leave a patch of skin on....  This is a good one. http://www.mnr.gov.on.ca/en/Business/Enforcement/2ColumnSubPage/273935.html"
591484,pics,2011-06-09 21:41:00,1268,"Go to Caledonia or Cayuga before the walleye season opens and you'll see lots of them taken home....There's no particular race doing it...just a bunch of guys who poach and seem to get away with it......I still don't have much faith in the CO's ability to police the huge areas they have with such small budgets...More political pressure is needed....Government workers keep growing in numbers except at the MNR, which is shrinking...."
591574,OutdoorDan,2011-06-10 06:11:00,325,"I don't really buy the whole low budget thing. Stand by a creek in October > Fine 15 snaggers > Get money > Make more enforcement. Rinse and repeat. It's not hard. A CO could easily accumulate over $1000 every day in fines just by giving out 200$ snagging tickets in the fall. But they don't. They are not stupid, it's obvious where to go. I think it's just a general flaw of approach/mentality in the MNR, possibly the approach that there are ""bigger things to deal with""."
591738,Michael_Brown,2011-06-10 18:54:00,411,"I'm pretty sure they are not on a commission basis. I sure a few of them wish they were, it would be tickets for everyone. Maybe we want to supply a couple of microwaves to help encourage more great enforcement of our resources."
591760,Carp,2011-06-10 20:52:00,1488,"Doesn't matter what nationality the poachers are. I'm just glad they got caught. I hope they lose their fishing licenses permanently if they get caught again, which I doubt will take long. Guys like this don't learn their lesson easily.  They have nerve going out there the next day and doing the same thing."
591857,pics,2011-06-11 01:33:00,1268,"The fines levied by the CO's goes to the province as general revenue, not to the MNR....They have limits on how far they can travel and with the offices spaced so far apart, they patrol the hotspots nearest to the home base......"
591872,Rod Caster,2011-06-11 02:13:00,5784,  Increased fines and enforcement from the MNR would increase non tax-based revenue for the province.... we really need a fisherman in politics.
591879,timmeh,2011-06-11 02:38:00,609,"Should have been $900 per fish over the limit, then they'd think twice. Good work MNR. Great to know the tips line is being followed through on.  Also very good to hear that we've got some good OFNers looking out for our waters. The MNR can't be everywhere so we need to keep helping them out."

591111,Michael_Brown,2011-06-08 19:22:00,411,"I always love to see the results from our hard working CO's in the province. Our resources are there for all to share but you must follow the rules.   Over Limit Of Black Crappie Costs Anglers $2,700 NEWS June 6, 2011  Three anglers have been fined a total of $2,700 for catching and keeping more Black Crappie than allowed with an Ontario Sport Fishing Licence. Zhong Dong Ye, Xiang Rong Huang and Ke Yong Yang of Markham pleaded guilty and were fined $900 each for possessing a total of 54 more than the permitted limit of fish. The court heard that on April 15, 2011, a Ministry of Natural Resources conservation officer inspected the anglers as they were leaving Sturgeon Lake, just north of the town of Lindsay, after a day of fishing. The officer was following up on a call to the MNR TIPS line. The anglers had 144 Black Crappie between them, while the legal limit was 30 fish each. Justice of the Peace Dianne J. Ballam heard the case in the Ontario Court of Justice, Lindsay, on May 27, 2011.

591112,OutdoorDan,2011-06-08 19:26:00,325,"Good to hear, although I'm curious about the technical implications. The 3 of them were all fined for 54 fish over the 3 person limit, which kind of implies party fishing is OK (ie if the 3 of them were caught with 90 crappie in one bucket, it would have been ok)."
591117,Terry,2011-06-08 19:31:00,14456, well they really are not saying that as in most cases they go after the biggest crime and drop the rest of the charges...  but whatever I am glad to see them charging them
591119,OutdoorDan,2011-06-08 19:38:00,325,"Yeah, I guess since they pled guilty party fishing or whatnot was likely dropped."

591131,crappieperchhunter,2011-06-08 19:50:00,2582,Glad to hear it   And Kudos to whoever called it in as well  I would have loved to see the fine be $2700 EACH though with a loss of there fishing license. Really make them pay and maybe a few other possible offenders might actually give it some thought before they try to rape our resources.
591137,kickingfrog,2011-06-08 20:05:00,8333,"Good to see the tips line played a role. They can't get 'em all but, we can help."

591172,Big Cliff,2011-06-08 21:32:00,6899,Oh do I ever hope that was one of the calls I made.  Believe me I will be watching and calling every time I see that sort of thing going on. KUDOS to our CO's.
591179,GBW,2011-06-08 21:40:00,8460,I'm glad they got busted!  add the tips line to your cell phones people cause it does work.
591188,Michael_Brown,2011-06-08 21:53:00,411,"  Restaurant? Did you want to explain this comment?  Nothing but a post about a few jerks being caught and fined. Poachers come in all shapes, sizes and colours. Poor taste jokes are not appreciated."
591192,glen,2011-06-08 22:03:00,2641,I think they should be made to replace the fish too.
591193,Big Cliff,2011-06-08 22:07:00,6899," Perhaps the ""JOKE"" is based on the fact that many have seen crappie being sold at markets etc.. Truly, there is little  or no reason to take 30+ crappie per person other than if you were going to sell them and unless you have a comercial license in which case you wouldn't be limited to only 30, selling them is a violation!  I have seen way too much abuse going on and it is about time some of these ""JERKS"" got caught and fined. These are only the tip of the iceberg."
591215,Michael_Brown,2011-06-08 23:01:00,411,Hey Cliff I agree. I have a very big issue with the fact that the sale of live crappie is allowed under a very limited number of commercial licenses in this province. This is a whole different issue and something I would love to discuss sometime with whoever makes these decisions. I have big issues with the pet trade imports as well but don't get me started. Place big restrictions on the bait industry but allow these other forms of invasive fish introductions to go unchecked.  A limit of 30 is very fair but some will always break the rules. With this kind of issue it is far to easy to pass the buck and say it was some other group. Fact is poaching is a problem all anglers oppose and I'm glad some took the time to call in the complaints to put an end to the abuse.  Credit paid where credit is due and the CO's earn the respect we have for them.

591234,coreyhkh,2011-06-09 00:06:00,163,Bucket fisherman I am glad the CO got them. I think we need more as I hardly see them. I have seen them at Tims more then I have on the water.
591252,toca,2011-06-09 00:45:00,274,you know that these people are going to give people like us a hard time. i already got harrassed last year by some rude white trash IQ challenged. I dont blame him since every morning its all littered with garbage and he doesnt see me cleaning them up.  Oh well time to get a boat.
591305,baal,2011-06-09 03:10:00,16,Great! So glad to see they got the punishment!
591306,Sinker,2011-06-09 03:13:00,8692,"  I was thinking the same thing. I think I might have even been there that day. I'm going to check my log and  see for sure. There were 3 guys, and they kept every fish that came over the gunnels. I left a detailed message with detailed discriptions of people, boat and where they launched on an answering machine. I remember being upset that i couldn`t get thru to a real person.....maybe it did work??  The sad thing is, they were right back there the very next day, and every other time i fished up there!!!!! I guess its worth it when they sell for $8.99/lb!!  EDIT: Just checked, I called on the 13th and 14th. I hope it was the same, ignorant, pathetic guys I called on that got nailed. Looks good on them. They deserve a lot more than what they got too. Shouldn`t be allowed to fish in this country again. These guys blatently sat there and poached fish in front of a crowd of people, who were telling them it was illegal to do what they were doing, and told them what the limit was. They just didn`t give a rats ass. Then to see the same goofs there the next day, doing the exact same thing, in front of a crowd of anglers AGAIN!! Man, I can`t even say what i wanted to do!!! Its quite clear they don`t care, they were back there fishing on the 16th!! Shouldn`t have a license ever again IMO!!!!     S."

591315,Sinker,2011-06-09 03:37:00,8692,"its got nothing to do with ethnicity, its got everything to do with ignorant poachers. Sure, these guys were of asian decent, but I`ve seen my share of redneck `roundeye` poachers as well. I call them in too : )  I can almost guarantee these bozo`s are out there keeping under/over slot walleyes, and keeping more than thier limit of them too!! They don`t care, and apparently have lots of money to keep paying the fines!!!  S."
