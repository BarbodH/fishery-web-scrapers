We are staying on the west end of the lake, we heard the walleye are big there but hard to find, mostly looking for some pike, and panfish, but certainly wouldn't pass on the 'eyes.  Also how is the lake for hidden rocks or other hazards, I don't really want to find out how challenging it is to change props on the water.  Thanks for your help"
