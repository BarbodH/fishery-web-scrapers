591624,GreenCanada,2011-06-10 13:40:00,375,"So after reading another post on the forum, I was left with a rather odd but reasonable question. If an angler is required to forfeit their fishing equipment to the Crown, what is done with it? Is it put on auction like the police occasionally do, so other may bid on it?  Any information on this would be appreciated, as it's left me scratching my head."
591718,HTHM,2011-06-10 18:23:00,4082,"Yes it is auctioned off, and no I do not know when."
591719,manitoubass2,2011-06-10 18:24:00,11391,"I don't want to find out, lol.  Maybe make a phone call in your area and see if you can find out that way?  Might be a great way to save some big bucks"

591730,Roy,2011-06-10 18:43:00,13728,"Very little of it goes to auction. Firearms seized from poachers are given to police to be destroyed. Fishing equipment is usually made available to organizations such as ""Take a Kid Fishing"". A lot of the time, seized gear will be returned to the to the owner if he's not known to be a repeat offender."

591788,Handlebarz,2011-06-10 22:56:00,3790,From what I have been told first hand by our local CO's is if you pay the fine they will return the equipment I had tried to buy the lures from some of the 6 or 8 rods they had in the boat one day they laughed and said that would go over good when the owner paid the fine and found the $30 lures were gone.
