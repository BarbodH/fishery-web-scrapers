I'll be opening up a buddy's cottage for him on Friday and then I'll wet a line for the first time in 2010 starting Saturday. Couldn't happen any sooner! It'll be interesting to see what the water levels are like on Georgian Bay, and where the pike are, what with the early spring and all. Anyone else heading north this weekend? Chris"

460836,Guest gbfisher,2010-04-28 15:31:00,0,Water levels are what they were three years ago. The fishing should still be good though if you know where to go.
460838,backbay,2010-04-28 15:42:00,773,"gb, I know the area well, I'll be interested to see if the fish are where they usually are this time of year, looking forward to finding them that's for sure!"
