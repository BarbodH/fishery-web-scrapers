460119,irishfield,2010-04-26 22:56:00,26272,Season opened and they all went into hiding !!! You know how that works...........
460121,misfish,2010-04-26 22:59:00,29133," Wayne,are you hearing the toms during the morning?"
460122,irishfield,2010-04-26 23:01:00,26272,"Yahh.. they're still out there somewhere. Making noise, but not doing their usual march down the runway at 11am !"
460124,lew,2010-04-26 23:02:00,12766, Their not hiding very well Wayne cause I had them all in my back yard this morning.   In fact I think we've got more gobblers around here than Robins
460125,Guest gbfisher,2010-04-26 23:02:00,0,  I told Marty to get the Wife's schedule and hunt the bird feeder when she wasn't home...

460202,Moosebunk,2010-04-27 01:01:00,3970," Come hunt my backyard. lol.  I'm learning that these ""turkeys"" are no ""turkeys.""  Skittish and mindful as all heck.  I just have to open the front door of the house and the ones two acres back seem to know and take off. lol.  Some big beauty Toms kicking around out there though... Too bad they taste like game. lol."
460220,Guest gbfisher,2010-04-27 01:40:00,0, geee...the ones out your way seem smart. The ones in Cobourg where my mother in-law lives are stupid. They sit by her feeder and wait till she comes out to fill it up. I think it's her voice that attracts them or the fact that well.... She's short.....tiny and .....looks kinda like a turkey  .
460290,Stern Rules,2010-04-27 04:03:00,342,I don't hunt yet but I saw 4 wild turkeys in a field Saturday just off the 403 towards Paris. Did a double take and checked the binoculars and they were turkeys.
460318,Musky or Specks,2010-04-27 11:40:00,2710,Report  My boss is a turkey
460451,AzuluSpookd,2010-04-27 17:38:00,348,"I have nothing to hold out for. The Shhhhh was in reference to GB's comment.  Yesterday, there were no birds in the first spot. Went out to Moonstone and had gobblers all around us, but wouldn't come out of the hardwood.  Decided to take 3 hours off of work this morning and head back out there by myself.  Set up a Hen Decoy, and the birds started gobblin' around 0605 hours. I tried a few different calls and the one they responded to the most was my mouth call, that I had been practicing on for quite a while.  After about 10 minutes going back and forth, the group of them came up on my left about 20 yards...4 Jakes and 2 Hens...going right for my decoy....no Tom, but I was looking for a Jake to go up on the wall...so I picked the biggest bugger and took him out. Nice bird, weighed in at 18.2 pounds at Wolf's Den (needed a weigh to enter contest)   All 3 other jakes started kicking and jumping on my dead bird, made me laugh.  Here it is. Pressure is over, now I can relax and get my big bird later.   "
460458,misfish,2010-04-27 17:59:00,29133,Well done bud.   Northing wrong with taking a jake. I have to wait til I get home to se the pic.They dont work here at work.      I still think yer holding out.   LOL
460460,Guest gbfisher,2010-04-27 18:04:00,0,Nice shootin....I think. ..It still has it's head. Where did ya shoot it?          Im kidding.  ...Now ya gotta get the deep fryer to cook it in.
460495,misfish,2010-04-27 20:16:00,29133,  DA NUTZ YA SAY.
460501,AzuluSpookd,2010-04-27 20:32:00,348,Are you freakin' kidding me? 
460530,Big Cliff,2010-04-27 21:22:00,6899,"A friend called me yesterday evening asked me to go over and have a look at his lawn tractor. I was going to go out to my blind so I figured I'd stop at his place on my way. When I pulled into his yard I saw what I thought was a turkey about 250 yards behind his house in his field. Pulled out the glasses and sure enough, a nice tom. Alex came out and I commented that there was a nice tom down back. Alex insisted I take his truck and drive down there. I wasn't going to bother figuring it would just run off but Alex was very insistant so to shut him up I drove down to where I had seen the bird, parked the truck, got out and loaded my gun, and sat on the tail gate. I let go with my gobbler call and within seconds he answered me from just inside the cedars about 30' away. I called again and he came running out of the bush with me sitting right there in the open. He stopped, for a second and looked at me like ""what the heck are you"". I didn't like the look he gave me so I shot him!  I sure don't see what the big deal is with turkey hunting, drive out into a field, sit in plain sight, total elapsed time about 10 minutes.  I use to go sit in my blind at 5 am all dressed in camo, haul my decoys out, call and watch careful to not make any movement that might tip them off that I was in the area. All I'd ever see was hens. To heck with it, from now on I'm going to drive out to the field in broad day light, honk the horn and wait for some dumb tom to challange me!"
460532,misfish,2010-04-27 21:35:00,29133, LOL Marty.
460574,musky66,2010-04-27 23:21:00,273,"Very funny story, I am not a hunter but appreciate the fact that I have no doubt hunters were partially responsible for the re-introduction of Turkey to Ontario. I really enjoy seeing them around."
460598,richyb,2010-04-28 00:08:00,774,Smoked this one at 30 yards. Didnt even flop. 
460629,walleyejigger,2010-04-28 00:50:00,876,"awesome turkeys guys,  finally dedided a few days ago to take the turkey course, (although i have no clue as to where to hunt)I looked it up for this area and it was that same day, i missed it, anyone know if it's only the ofah that does these courses, i looked it up but thats all i could find, the dates on ofah website"
460635,misfish,2010-04-28 00:54:00,29133, I was waiting for your report Rich.  Nice shooting bud and nice looking bird.  TFS
