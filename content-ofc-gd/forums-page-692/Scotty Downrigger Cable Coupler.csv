460556,bluesky1713,2010-04-27 22:45:00,107,Just wondering whether anyone has used the Scotty Cable Coupler product as the terminal kit for their downrigger cable?  Is it any good?  Am I better off with the conventional metal terminal kit?  No. 1038 Cable Coupler http://www.scotty.com/fishing-gear-equipment/downrigger-accessories/terminal-kits-stopper-beads.htm
460565,glen,2010-04-27 23:00:00,2641,I have not tried those ones.  I have used just a heavy snap swivel (300lb or so) without any problems.
460569,irishfield,2010-04-27 23:05:00,26272,I like Cannon's swagless ends myself.    http://store.cannondownriggers.com/products/324727/Terminator_Single
460580,NANUK,2010-04-27 23:37:00,797,"Another vote for Cannon, very good & strong connection. no sleeves, no crimping, no loose cable strands to poke your hands."
460581,Fisherman,2010-04-27 23:42:00,7201,"I use the #1151 Scottys, double crimped with the tag end doubled back and hidden inn the second crimp, no stabbing with fine wire."
460590,bluesky1713,2010-04-27 23:52:00,107,Thanks for the advice everyone!
460605,bluesky1713,2010-04-28 00:15:00,107,Any idea where I could pick up one of those Cannon Singles? (Parry Sound)  Canadian Tire here has nothing like that.  Maybe Barrie?
460648,Fisherman,2010-04-28 01:16:00,7201,Give Tromblys Tackle in Orillia or Epps north of Orillia a call.
460661,irishfield,2010-04-28 01:31:00,26272,"Do you just need one?? or two?  Send me a PM with your name and address. I've gotta hit the post office tomorrow anyhow! .. already photocopied the ""how to"" diagram from inside the kit lid for you.  Wayne"
460667,Fang,2010-04-28 01:37:00,1330,"cannon's good, also try the walker clincher."
460670,desship,2010-04-28 01:41:00,96,I switched to the Klincher . Can be bought at Le Baron or Shortwave no tools required under 4 bucks similar to cannon.
460671,Raf,2010-04-28 01:41:00,3495, Have you tried Diver's Nook on Bowes?  He has some tackle in there.
460692,irishfield,2010-04-28 02:18:00,26272,In the mail in the morning Josh!
460708,Guest gbfisher,2010-04-28 02:35:00,0, Gordon Bay Marina may have them. I know they sell riggers.
460713,irishfield,2010-04-28 02:41:00,26272,I've got him covered Andy. Had a full Cannon kit in the boat..
460720,Guest gbfisher,2010-04-28 02:50:00,0,  I see that.    He knows now for next time.... I keep a couple around.
460724,bluesky1713,2010-04-28 02:53:00,107,"Awesome, Wayne!  Thanks again."
