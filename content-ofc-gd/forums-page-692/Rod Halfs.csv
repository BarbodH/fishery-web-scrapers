Does anybody know of a site or place that has the upper part of the rods in stock or for sale, or better yet, does anybody have them kicking around  the are  1 shimano izumi series mh 7ft spinning 1 shimano izumi series 10 6 spinning 1 berkely lighting rod 6 6 spinning  not the greatest rods but if i can find the tops for these then they are good backups.  thanks  Anders"
