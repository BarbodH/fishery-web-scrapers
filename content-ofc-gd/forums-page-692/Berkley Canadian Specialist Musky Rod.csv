460719,Rizzo,2010-04-28 02:48:00,4754,Just wondering if anyone has an idea on the value of this rod? I bought it a few years back at LeB's but don't see it on their website anymore. I had told a friend who's just starting into musky fishing he could have it for half price but I can't figure out what this thing is worth. Anyone recall what they paid for theirs? If I had to guess I'd say its a $70.00-$80.00 rod??
460787,Andy,2010-04-28 13:08:00,330,"If I'm not mistaken, you are referring to a Fenwick Canadian Specialties rod. Still on the LeBaron's site, goes for $65.00. I had one in excellent condition and I sold it about two months ago for $30.00. It went quick at that price."
460803,asdve23rveavwa,2010-04-28 13:53:00,2690,"Yup, and, I can't wait to use it!!!!!!!!"
460832,linweir,2010-04-28 14:59:00,202,"I have two Berkley Canadian Specialist muskie rods, one casting one spinning, 5/8~3 oz lure weight. I bought them used several years back, $30~ $40 each. They are not high profile but they are good."
460835,Andy,2010-04-28 15:29:00,330," There ya go, I'm the one whose got the wrong rod. Either way, you get an idea on value."
460930,Rizzo,2010-04-28 20:44:00,4754,"Definitely wasn't $30-40 (is there such a thing as a $30 baitcaster musky rod?) maybe linweir got his used or its probably not the same rod. I bought 2 rods at the same time, one was a lower cost rod which was a Daiwa Heartland S which was 50 something dollars, and the other was the Canadian Specialist which I'm pretty sure was more like $70.00."
460948,asdve23rveavwa,2010-04-28 21:39:00,2690,"Think you mis-read the other statements...$30-40 was the used price.  So, if you want to sell it to your friend, that is the going rate."
460962,buckster,2010-04-28 22:44:00,530,  The rods went for 70 bucks...
460971,Rizzo,2010-04-28 23:19:00,4754," indeed I did. That all works out then, I was thinking around $35-40. Somehow i missed the word ""used"" in linweir's reply. Thanks all for the info"
