It was a great day to be on the bay.  Temps in the bay were 49'F in the main lake and up to 53'F in the shallows.  Lots of turtles, beavers, and woodpeckers were busy enjoying the weather.  We landed many blugils, pumpkins, perch and chunky rock bass on the floats, and of course a few bass and pike wanted to taste our tiny tubes.  The carp were starting to hurd up also, so its going to be time to get out the corn.  Thanks Mike for the good times.  Cheers  9 inch Bluegil   Chunky Rocky       "
