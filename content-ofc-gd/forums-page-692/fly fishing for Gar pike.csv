460918,justin s,2010-04-28 19:26:00,16,Im from oshawa ont and i was wondering where a good spot to hammer Gar i herd lock 1 is good if so whet time of year is prime??
460921,torco,2010-04-28 19:42:00,656," Hey,  If you can get a copy of Canadian Fly fisher magazine from July 2007. They did a feature on it.  also try the following link. I believe she has an old article from the magazine on her blog.  http://flyaddicts.com/flygal/  From what I remember out Belleville way is good."
460947,laszlo,2010-04-28 21:29:00,487,I've seen them spawning as late as the last week of June. Prime months are July and August when the sun is high and the temps are HOT!
460977,landry,2010-04-28 23:49:00,1005,you will be disappointed on their strength. They jump and move quick but they have very little weight/pull. I bored of it in no time and went back to a real flyfishing challenge - carp:)
461110,gone_fishin,2010-04-29 02:49:00,481," agreed! no strength at all. cool looking fish, and a challenge to catch, but no fight. as soon as you get their nose out of the water they are done!"
461145,Afraz,2010-04-29 09:21:00,250,"Tonnes of Gar pike at the first lock in Trenton, i tried throing everything their way to entice a bite. but nothing ever worked a buddy of mine suggested i use live frogs maybe you can use frog imitations on a fly and work em slow."
461154,OhioFisherman,2010-04-29 11:35:00,6623,"I have never tried fly fishing for them, but I have caught a number of them on spinning and casting tackle. Like mentioned for their size they are a disappointment. A better fight from a sheephead or walleye."
461155,justin s,2010-04-29 11:40:00,16,Thanks for the info guys !!!
