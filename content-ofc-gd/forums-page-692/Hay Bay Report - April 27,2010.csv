The water is LOW!!!!!, Shermans Point Launch Ramp has the dock in and it sticks out in the water past the end of the cement pad. I was able to launch my boat on Monday and dock it, nothwithstanding the SE winds.  The water temp on the Lowrance was 55.5 Degs F - that's really wam for the end of April......  The Superdad is all loaded with fuel and ready for the Saturday blast off to the fishing gounds.  If you have a radio - channel 71 will be monitored... Say hello  Tuesday Morning brought a surprise awakening with white precipitation falling.    It all disappeared by 0900 but it was an eye opener.  C U on the water.  Cheers  David  aka  Superdad"
