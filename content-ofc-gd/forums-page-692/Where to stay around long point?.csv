We're thinking of heading to the long point area and would like to get out onto the water for some perch fishing.  We wanted to stay at the provincial park, but they arent open until the 14th.  Are there any campgrounds in the area that would be open yet, and would have a place to dock a boat (i'll have the 12' tinny on the roof of the trailer and will be putting it in by hand).  We may have to wait until the weekend of the 14th when long point prov. park opens (there are still plenty of sites available) even if there IS a liquor ban until after the long weekend   ryan"
460180,danbouck,2010-04-27 00:23:00,4380,I think you will have to wait.
460236,johndox,2010-04-27 02:13:00,54,I think there is a trailer park right in St. Williams dont know if they would be open that early or not
460242,tb4me,2010-04-27 02:24:00,3295,ya Bacus mill in st willies..Im not to sure if they would be open or not..no water acess thou..
460244,vinnimon,2010-04-27 02:26:00,2593,I was thinking st williams as well.
460516,SBCregal,2010-04-27 20:59:00,688,water access would be pretty important as i will have to hand launch the boat. i guess we'll have to wait a few more weekends to head that way.  now to figure out somewhere else to head to.  ryan
460715,Banger68,2010-04-28 02:43:00,157,Hidden Valley in Normandale is opening this weekend I think. But it is well away from the lake (not dragging the boat by hand).
