HERE'S THE VID  <object width=""480"" height=""385""><param name=""movie"" value=""    AND SOME PICS FROM THIS EVENINGS JAUNT                                   "
460292,Syn,2010-04-27 04:37:00,519,"Great report. Very entertaining. Loved the video. ha ha watched it a few times.  Three turtle pic is icing on the cake.  Looked like you had a great day. Don't give up on the crappies. Keep trying and you'll eventually hit the jackpot if they exist on that body of water.  Where I shore fish for them they are usually schooled up and easy to catch with a thill bobber and yellow/black 1/2"" fly or 1/16oz jig yellow micro tube."
460296,sirfish,2010-04-27 05:55:00,175,Looks like you had a great day.Love the turtle sunning.
460300,ibefishin,2010-04-27 07:15:00,5,"nice report, Last weekend I too noticed bass in areas they are not usually at till end of May or so,  Everything is way ahead of normal this year.  sirfish, bass are open all year in that neck of the woods as I'm sure limeyangler will confirm."
460314,Jer,2010-04-27 10:46:00,1426,  You should really check the location and the regs before making such accusations. Bass is open year round in most of northern Ontario.

460331,bushart,2010-04-27 12:28:00,2628,I tried Crappies on the weekend too Simon---zippo  Think the water is still too cold---I started at 44 degrees---best I found all day was 50  Watch for those big snappin turtles in the Goon---there's some biggies (Realizing those are not in your pic)
460366,limeyangler,2010-04-27 13:54:00,5204,"  Thanks syn.....they definitely exist on this body of water....and yup...slip bobber is the way to go too....here's a vid from last year...albeit around June   <embed width=""600"" height=""361"" type=""application/x-shockwave-flash"" allowFullscreen=""true"" allowNetworking=""all"" wmode=""transparent"" src=""http://static.photobucket.com/player.swf?file=http://vid263.photobucket.com/albums/ii158/vishuscirquel/crappie.flv"">    And i mananged to find one whilst icefishing this year too....again it was a bit odd as general rule seems to be where you find one you find another...but this one was travelling solo...lol         No problem sirfish, i get this every year when i post my first bass sessions.     I think your'e right on the water temps, mind you i got into a bay....shallow...and surface temp was 60, some of the deeper bays were 55, and then some spots showing 40 - 45.  I've tried everything in the crappy textbook in terms of presentations, depths, locations etc...etc...lol...zip...nada. I did find out a couple guys got 10 crappie where i was fishing...but i never saw a thing...or even got a bite at that location.....oh well...lol.  and yes...there certainly are some monster snapping T's on the goon...saw one 2 years ago sat on our shore (rock) its shell was the size of a large garbage can lid!"
460369,MCTFisher9120,2010-04-27 13:58:00,3761,"Thanks for the report, must be nice to be catching some smallies so soon  Great job with the camera as always, MTBF"
460577,Leecher,2010-04-27 23:30:00,7832,"Great report, pics and video Simon Might want to try medium spinnerbaits for them crappies.... I remember catching them on the Ottawa O a couple of years ago with the full size ones  Never know, just might trigger them to react Got to love hooking into some bronze backs at this time of year!!!! Beauties  Keep at it.... I'm sure sooner or later some will commit Thanks for sharing Jacques"
460698,limeyangler,2010-04-28 02:23:00,5204, Thanks Mike...when does bass open for you?     I dont own any spinnerbaits come to think of it....i was using beetlespins though....with mini tubes and white/chart 1/8 jigs and minnows......i'm gonna give it another shot on thursday morning with a buddy....will pick up a spinner bait. However i only have a couple of hours out there...and so far the amount of time i'm spending changing up gear to try different things to trigger a bite is not paying any dividends so far.  Anyway Jacques...thanks for the reply....you always do
460709,tibbs,2010-04-28 02:36:00,650,Nice Job!  Can't wait to go bass fishing myself once the season opens.
460722,Cudz,2010-04-28 02:53:00,2652,"I am surprised you caught a smallie on a crayfish coloured wiggle wart. You must have caught that fish on another lure and then stuck the ww in its mouth. Pay attention people:  Crayfish coloured wiggle warts do not catch smallmouth bass.      Now that you all know this, pm me and I will send you my mailing address.  Just pack them up and send them to me and I will dispose of them.  By doing this, you free yourselves of valuable tackle box space."
460774,Toddyc20,2010-04-28 12:33:00,141,Seeing those pics of such nice looking bass makes me want to pack up the boat and start driving north till i get far enough that i can start bass fishing.  June 26th seems so far away.
