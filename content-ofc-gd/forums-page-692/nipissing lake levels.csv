460726,Nipfisher,2010-04-28 02:55:00,2449,We are scheduled to rent 2 houseboats from Bruce at Tamar Island for the long weekend. He told us last night that all the boats are beached right now. Would cause too muuch damage to drag them so they'll have to be lifeted and rolled to the water.

460759,Bernie,2010-04-28 10:53:00,3190,Nipissing is still well over 2 ft low and not coming up in the last couple of weeks. We need some serious rainfall.
