460110,TJQ,2010-04-26 22:47:00,7806,"Went into Jiggy this weekend for the first time to open up the camp and cut down some really big pines that were hanging the wrong way and were a danger if they came down.  Good weekend for animal viewing 2 swamp donkeys, 9 bush chickens, 3 beavers, 1 otter, and a cute porky pick.  North enough for there to still be snow on the ground from the last squall.  Did a bit of fishing to no avail.. the rivers pretty low... July levels really. Fishing never good early anyway.. lol.. ya thats it.  I was pretty impressed we managed to take these monsters down, right next to and in between the two camps and put them right where I wanted them. Lots of cord wood for sure now.  <object width=""660"" height=""405""><param name=""movie"" value=""                      Didnt even need the cooler!!       "
