460955,Roy,2010-04-28 22:14:00,13728,Does anyone know where the best price/service is? I need one for May. In the 2500 size. Thanks.
460981,bigbuck,2010-04-29 00:00:00,2449,"Roy, I'd check JB's Fishing Depot. I'm sure Brian would price match anyone else out there and you'll end up buying a bunch of other stuff, his selection of gear is unmatched."
460984,darsky,2010-04-29 00:05:00,586,Roy with the Can/US dollar I would look for buying online in US
460998,scugpg,2010-04-29 00:41:00,1373,Could try Jos at Angling outfitters I think he has some 2500's in stock.  I've played with one a bit and I'd recommend the Stradic MGFB before I would the CI4. The can be had pretty cheap if you can track them down still.
461066,darsky,2010-04-29 01:52:00,586,199 seems the best advertised price
461096,MCTFisher9120,2010-04-29 02:20:00,3761,This is all I came up with Roy.  $210 Canadian on Cabelas's site...not sure on how long shipping takes.  Best of luck. http://www.cabelas.com/cabelas/en/templates/links/link.jsp?id=0071853124748a&type=product&cmCat=SEARCH_all_NYR&returnPage=search-results1.jsp&Ntk=Products&sort=all&Go.y=0&selectedPerPage=72&Nty=1&hasJS=true&Ne=2510&nyr=1&Ntt=spinning+reels&Ns=SEL_LOW_PRICE|0&N=3367&Go.x=0&_DARGS=/cabelas/en/common/search/search-box.jsp.form1&_dyncharset=ISO-8859-1
461138,archie_james_c,2010-04-29 04:50:00,618,Might get lucky and find one on FleaBay for 180$USD. Might as well just buck up and pay 199.99$ for one and get it right away rather than waiting for Ebay to pop one up for 10$ cheaper. I was gunna run them on my rods this year but I think I'll suck up the extra 3 oz's (and 80$) and run Daiwa Advantage-A's or Tierra's.
