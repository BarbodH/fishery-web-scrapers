460953,MCTFisher9120,2010-04-28 22:06:00,3761,A few months ago they hired 2 CO's now there getting another 2. Nice to see.
460956,Michael_Brown,2010-04-28 22:19:00,411, I'm not quite sure but I think this would make about 6 posting since the new year. One had a native requirement but it is nice to see.
460960,Terry,2010-04-28 22:35:00,14456,yeah but are they new jobs or through attrition
460963,Ben_Daniels,2010-04-28 22:50:00,435, That's whats I was wondering.  -Ben

460970,Michael_Brown,2010-04-28 23:16:00,411," I have no idea but I have been hearing of more CO sightings recently. They used to be like meeting sasquatch.  I just post these in case any of the board members may be interested. A few OFC friendly CO's could be helpful someday, besides I think most outdoor minded people think a CO position would be interesting.  Regardless new or replacement positions at least they are hiring."
461183,radar,2010-04-29 13:17:00,138,The gov't is on a pretty tight hiring freeze. It appears there are no new hires. They do Bull tactics like waiting until the last minute to hire someone when an opening happens to save a few months pay. I work in a different Ministry but it appears to be that way everywhere.
461319,chilli,2010-04-29 18:46:00,199,I wouldn't want a CO's job. Sure you get to bust the degenerate poachers who abuse the resources I want to protect but it's gotta take it's toll on your respect for society in general. There are so many who abuse the resources; the CO's must just be discusted by the end of every working day.
