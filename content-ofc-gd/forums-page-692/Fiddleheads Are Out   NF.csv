459468,Stern Rules,2010-04-25 06:44:00,342,"Managed to get a couple lbs worth Saturday. Some spots are out while others are not. Wasn't expecting them to be out 'til next week. Anybody else getting any or were you concentrating on the trout opener? Speaking of the opener, ran into a gentleman that got a nice brookie about 10 inches right where I was looking last year. Now I know where I'm going. Love those brookies."
459474,aniceguy,2010-04-25 09:37:00,1094,"  saw them yesterday but didnt have a bag, wont mae that mistake today though"
459500,brifishrgy,2010-04-25 12:52:00,559,"I have never had them but seen people out collecting them, do you just pick the curled end or the whole ""stock"" .. my son want to go pick some and I wouldn't mind trying them .. if I get some I am going to need a way to cook em? (I imagine the same as any veggie, steam em)"
459725,luv2drift,2010-04-26 01:15:00,147,   pick them withing 3 inches of the ground and cook well.  best in a pan cooked with a couple of pieces of bacon on the side with trout.
459738,Stern Rules,2010-04-26 01:42:00,342,Usually you just pick the curled end. I don't usually pick them with much of the stem. Make sure you cook them well and do not eat raw. Definately read the article from the link. I didn't know about the toxins until I read it. Good to know.  http://www.hc-sc.gc.ca/fn-an/securit/kitchen-cuisine/fiddlehead-fougere-eng.php
459742,tightline,2010-04-26 01:48:00,322,"Was out on Friday for a walk and found loads...Anyone in the Guelph region looking, head down to the walking trails at the end of Watson Rd and the Eramosa river...there everywhere...happy hunting"

459775,tb4me,2010-04-26 05:07:00,3295,lots of fiddle heads and asparagus round here...yummy!!
459988,ehg,2010-04-26 18:15:00,2666,"Adding morels to those fiddleheads, with a serving of fresh caught fish, cannot be beat at this time of year. "
461144,Afraz,2010-04-29 09:16:00,250,What are fiddleheads used for ? salads ?
461196,torco,2010-04-29 13:55:00,656,I noticed that they were out walking the dog through the woods the other night. I am going to bring an extra bag with me tonight and pick some.
461201,NAW,2010-04-29 14:11:00,4022, Make sure you don't get your two bags mixed up
461211,Brettiop,2010-04-29 15:02:00,279,"Found a whole bunch after a failed day of trout fishing. First time Ive been picking them, and eating them last night. They were fantastic."
461230,POLLIWOGG,2010-04-29 15:50:00,835,"Make sure to leave a few stalks on each plant, if you pick them clean it kills the plant."
461234,ehg,2010-04-29 15:57:00,2666,You need to thouroughly clean then cook that stuff.
461240,capt bruce,2010-04-29 16:08:00,820,"AFRAZ ,You can eat them raw in salads or fry up some in garlic butter etc. , any recipe you use for asparagus will work ."
461244,ehg,2010-04-29 16:15:00,2666,You could eat them in salads but it is best discouraged due to misidentification.
461258,Headhunter,2010-04-29 16:43:00,5703,"My recipe: Clean and thoroughly wash them. I semi-boil them in salted water. I drain them, then spread them out evenly on a slightly greased cookie sheet. I add garlic, salt and pepper, then cover them with some grated Parmesian (sp) cheese. Put them under the broiler until the cheese is fully melted. Enjoy! HH"
461264,Stern Rules,2010-04-29 16:48:00,342,Exactly. It's recommended that you only pick 3 or 4 from each plant. Don't pick the whole plant or it'll die.
461266,Stern Rules,2010-04-29 16:50:00,342,FALSE. Under no circumstances should fiddleheads be eaten raw. Read this:  http://www.hc-sc.gc.ca/fn-an/securit/kitchen-cuisine/fiddlehead-fougere-eng.php
461278,TJQ,2010-04-29 17:09:00,7806, That sounds awesome!!
461283,Spiel,2010-04-29 17:16:00,9065,"Fish Farmer just left here with directions to where I saw lots of fiddle heads last Saturday on the opener, I hope he finds them."
461284,Afraz,2010-04-29 17:16:00,250,"Wow some of u guys just tried to poison me ahhahahah. No worries, i guess i'll just stick to store bought greens. No bush tucker for me XD"
