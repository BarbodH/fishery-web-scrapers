460861,capt bruce,2010-04-28 16:27:00,820,"I think you got it right Cram , I got this from the The Ministry of Natural Resources website.. Question Re: Fishing From the Water Near the Shore or close to a Dock Some of the best places to find fish are in the near-shore areas, especially where there are undercut banks and docks that provide shade. Can I fish in these areas?  Answer: The Ministry of Natural Resources recognizes the interests of private land owners and recreational fishing enthusiasts and encourages respect and cooperation between them.  Generally, naturally occurring and man-made watercourses that are navigable, and that have legal access points, are open to the public for boating regardless of ownership of the bed of the water body. Most docks, marinas and lagoons constructed on lakes and rivers would fit this description.    Ontario's fish resources are managed by the government for the benefit of the public and as such are not the property of individual landowners whose property they may associate with while near the shoreline, in lagoons or under the docks of marinas.    Equally important is the landowner's right to control access to, and the use of, private property. A person with control of a property may allow or exclude access to that property, or put conditions on the entry to the property. In the case of a dock, while a fisher may cast from a boat for fish under the dock he or she may need to consult the dock owner before standing on the dock to angle for the same fish.    Likewise property owners have the right to use their property without unusual interference. A person owning property on a water body expects a reasonable amount of boating and fishing activity near-by, however they do not expect someone to fish persistently on their shoreline for long uninterrupted periods of time.    Both landowners and the outdoors public must be reasonable and respectful in exercising their rights and obligations.  The  last sentence says it all to me , BOTH should respect each other , and even if this guy has had damage to his boat ,his children, whatever in the past , in no way was a father in a small boat with a very young child pan fishing gonna cause any problems and if he was worried he should have just asked if they were haveing any luck (after seeing what was going on and ensureing his property was safe) and went about his way,enjoying the outdoors and seeing a father and son out together bonding should have made his day so much the better  ..."
460863,bigfish1965,2010-04-28 16:37:00,3382,"Both landowners and the outdoors public must be reasonable and respectful in exercising their rights and obligations.   Lets end it with that line, shall we??"
460496,bigfish1965,2010-04-27 20:17:00,3382,"I've not ever left a hook in a dock nor been unfortunate enough to get into someones canvas. That doesn't mean I have never got snagged on a dock anchor, I just use strong enough line to straighten the hook out. Fish live near structure. 99% of structure on most lakes is some kind of shoreline. Losing lures happens. I never cast near dock ladders..that is a bit too risky to me.  However we all own the water and we must not let anyone push us out.... ( I am starting to sound like the NRA here, so I will stop)"
460518,DRIFTER_016,2010-04-27 21:02:00,10439,"  FYI A marina is not a place to be swimming. Marinas are for boats, beaches are for swimming."
460522,cram,2010-04-27 21:11:00,1733,  Wanted to add.....i don't think this applies to crappie fishing off of an absent marina.  Moreso around inhabited docks.
460523,cram,2010-04-27 21:13:00,1733," Pretty sure he's referring to his own personal dock.  I know i swim off of mine all the time.  And, have taken more than one fugitive lure off the swimming ladder."
460537,Big Cliff,2010-04-27 21:50:00,6899,"OK, as always there are two sides to every story.  My property is assessed at $1200.00 for every linear foot of shore line that I own and I have to pay taxes on that. I do believe that I should have the right to enjoy my waterfront without interfearance from people who don't live here or pay the taxes on my property or shore line.  Now, that being said anyone in a boat does have the right to fish in front of my place and I never object to that when it happens, in fact I will often go down and say hi to them but if my family want to fish off the dock or swim I would expect the people in the boat to move off and allow me to use that area as a common courticy. I can't move my shore line!  I have also seen some land owners getting very frustrated lately. they like to go down to their dock with their kids and catch a few fish. One very small bay in particular has been getting pounded lately by boat loads of people who move in like a swarm of black flies (last saturday five boats with 3-5 people on each boat)and they don't leave until there are no fish left in the bay. Do they deserve respect? Not if they don't respect that the land owner should be able to enjoy the water too.  If you were out in the middle of the lake anchored and catching fish and all of a sudden 5 boat loads of people moved in on you to the point where you couldn't continue fishing would you be upset? I expect you would! Same differance except you could move, the land owners can't! (or at least shouldn't have to).  That being said, no one has the right to be an A hole and make a little kid cry! If he had asked you nicely, would you have moved off?"
460544,DRIFTER_016,2010-04-27 22:16:00,10439, Possibly but the OP said he was fishing in an empty marina not in front of a cottage owners dock. It's comparing apples to oranges.
460559,Terry,2010-04-27 22:50:00,14456," well if truth be known, there are always 3 sides to every story...yours, his and the truth...LOL  I agree with what you say, however I have had on or then one occasion when I was fishing an empty dock the owners run down to the dock yelling and making noise and trying to get their dog or kids to jump in the water to stop the evil fisherman from raping the fish that hang near his god given dock.. in over 30 years of flipping I have never chipped a boat on a dock or left a hook behind..however I have caught a dock but always stop and remove the hook"
460620,cram,2010-04-28 00:43:00,1733," Many of us are pretty good fishermen (and fisherwomen) who can likely cast to and around a dock and not leave a mess behind....but i bet we're the exception more than the rule. I bet 3/4 of my friends couldn't cast near a dock or boat without hitting it.  While land and dock owners don't own the water, and its in our legal right to fish wherever we want....do we REALLY need to go fishing around someone's dock?  I *get* that they hold bass....but so do a million other types of structure.   Fishing for me is larely about being out in nature...the last thing i want to do after driving 3 hrs north is park myself in front of someone's dock when there's miles and miles of relatively pristine wilderness to take advantage of."
460631,Dave Bailey,2010-04-28 00:52:00,1641,  Sounds logical.
460752,Terry,2010-04-28 09:05:00,14456," I know people that have won thousands of dollars in tourneys fishing docks..on some lakes it is the best structure on some lake the only structure on the lake..and crappie it's the number on place to catch them in the spring........what do you like to fish, rivers maybe....lots of people don't like everyone on the rivers fishing, why no wait till the fish make it to the lake and fish it there after all do you really need to walk the river for steelies and browns and .the others ..I am kidding.. but same thing in my eyes......"
460754,fish_fishburn,2010-04-28 09:43:00,1311,"I'm a bass fisherman and I fish docks quite often. I usually wait till mid-day when the sun is high and the docks provide good shade. Up here in my area I have never had a landowner come out and give me heck for fishing his dock. They sometimes come out and ask questions about my bassboat or what bait i'm using and there very pleasant. I love skipping tubes under docks or boats. In the event of getting snagged on a dock and it happens once in a while I get out of the boat and go on the dock and get my hook, no problems. Lots of times they are watcing me from there cottage or deck and I just wave to them and they wave back. Maybe were just a little more civilized up here.haha. P.s. if they are sitting on there docks or people are swimming there I don't want to fish there dock anyways and just exchange pleasantries and move on."
460756,singingdog,2010-04-28 10:23:00,1047," On one hand I hear what you are saying. On the other hand, you knowingly bought land that shares a border (the lakefront) with public space (the lake). It's a little like buying a place that borders a public park, then getting upset that folks are playing baseball right outside your yard. My property borders a snowmobile trail on an old railbed. I really wish that those folks would stop snowmobiling right past my place at all hours of the night, but I knew what I was getting into when I bought the place."
460784,solopaddler,2010-04-28 13:00:00,8605,I agree completely with DanD and Cliff's sentiments.  I could easily see how a steady stream of anglers flipping at ones dock would drive someone around the bend.  If it was that much of a problem I wouldn't confront anybody though.  I'd sell and buy a place further north where I never get bothered.  Which is exactly what I did.
460791,cram,2010-04-28 13:22:00,1733," The day our moral fabric comes from what happens in fishing tournaments is a sad day.  I have been sitting on my dock, fishing, and a boat comes along the shore and starts casting to my dock while i'm on it casting out.  My cottage is on a lake that's 10 miles long and 3/4 of the shoreline is uninhabited....no need to cast to my dock while i'm using it.  And, no need to leave lures and hooks in my swimming ladder just because there's good fishing beneath it.  Just because they do it on tv, or in tournaments....doesn't make it polite."
460792,Harrison,2010-04-28 13:26:00,2202,"I fish docks almost exclusively on certain lakes and won a few sheckles doing so.  I have run into all types of land owners.  Some nice, some not so nice, and some plain evil.  I try 110% to be as careful as I can and if I do snag up, I WILL get it.  Even if I have to jump on the dock to do so.  I always have an extra bag of plastics on the deck to throw incase I run into kids on shore or a half decent owner who comes down for a chat.  Then there is ethics and simple manners too, unfortunately this can be lacking on both sides. If someone is fishing on their dock, you swing way wide, wish them luck and move on.  There are no style/kind/depth of dock that won't be fished by someone.  I know some owners rap there docks in rope and others snags to deter guys. I actually look for those docks to fish, more structure for them.  Cliff, it is frustrating, and I pretty sure I know your dock if your just up from the mouth of GB, there is no fish in the area! lol  One owner had a sign on his dock that said something along the lines of ""hook free zone, Kids Swimming""  I thought it was a good idea.  May not stop people, but maybe make them a little more conscience."
460794,jimmer,2010-04-28 13:32:00,2730,"I'm with you on that.  Nothing like getting away from it all and enjoying nature.  As much as I believe anglers should be able to fish docks, it's definitely not for me, I avoid them like the plague in most cases.  I have found myself trailering the boat to less populated lakes lately to enjoy the serenity of being one of the few boats on the lake.  I avoid them in tournaments also, so many other places to fish and yes, I have seen many tourneys won on docks, but I still can't bring myself to having an audience when fishing someone's dock.  Too many strange experiences like someone all of sudden starting to throw a frisbee in the water for their dog to retrieve.  They weren't being mouthy or rude, but it was their choice if they wanted to use the water.  I just moved on with a laugh and fished a different area."
460801,capt bruce,2010-04-28 13:49:00,820,"Sorry guys but who or what gave you guys(landowners) the right to put a dock out into water YOU DO NOT OWN and now you think you can tie your boat up to it (further extending what you think are your rights into water YOU DO NOT OWN) and than because you have done this , my family is not allowed to go near there. My house backs onto a city park why cant I extend a long picknic table out from my fence into the park and than tell everyone you cant play ball there as my children eat  their lunch at my table.Sounds crazy right , but most if not all shore line landowners think they can extend docks, tie boats up etc.Take your boat out of the water everynight like us poor taxpayers without docks , than you will not have to worry about people scratching them , take your kids swimming at a beach no fish hooks there ..You own the land the water is everyones get used to it , just beceause you are lucky enough to own shoreline gives you NO RIGHT to everyones WATER ..."

460837,DanD,2010-04-28 15:31:00,2223,"In theory any structure built on or over navigable water, would have required the approval of the Canadian Coast Guard under the Navigable Waters Protection Act. I don’t think anyone is going to give a permit for your planks or your car’s hitching post; nor would they give anyone a permit for a dock; if it’s purposed location and construction didn’t meet the requirements set out in the regulations. The Superintendent of Navigable Waters Protection is in  Sarnia at 201 North Front St., Ste. 703, Sarnia, ON N7T 8B1. or at least it was.  Dan"
460845,cram,2010-04-28 15:55:00,1733," Pretty sure you don't need approval if the dock fits under the standard guidelines in their regs, which are admittedly hard to find.  In short, the gov't enables landowners to extend docks from their properties (as long as they fit those guidelines, which i think have both standard size restrictions and overall restrictions on obstructing navigable waterways), but that is not ownership of the land beneath the water or the water itself.  It is within your legal rights to troll alongside or cast to any dock that you wish, whether there are people on it or not.  It is also within your legal rights to pull your boat up alongside another fisherman and drop a line.  Or, within your legal rights to cast your line towards another boat as long as you're not endangering anyone.  I guess it all comes down to common sense, right?  We all have different values on what we feel is fair/right....but i see it being pretty unanimous that the cottage/dock owners are irritated by fishermen infringing on their space when they're out on their own dock. So, even if you're legally entitled...why be a nuisance?  Like Cliff said, its no different from you being on your boat and another pulling up alongside or casting to the shade under your boat. Kind of tastes the same to me."
460848,cram,2010-04-28 16:03:00,1733," Interestingly there's a lawyer in town who has gone to court several times with the argument that parking tickets in toronto are illegal....that you have the legal right to park your car on ontario roads, and the municipality is illegally collecting revenue from you.  I don't think he's been very successful, but it is an interesting argument.  As for your question about the park....look at it another way.  Imagine that the park is 1000 acres, but instead of finding an open spot somewhere in the park, people often park right behind your fence....for whatever reason.    You're sitting there in your backyard, looking out at the people who are sitting on the other side of hte fence looking in at you....and behind them is 1000 acres of parkland to enjoy.  They're legally entitled...but doesn't it make you kind of go ""why?""."

The owner told us that it was ""man made"" and we were tresspassing.  I thought that as long as I wasn't tied to his docks or bumbing into them that I was okay, no?  There was absolutely nobody at the park, and he made my little guy bawl his eyes out when I told him we had to leave because the action was hot, so the guy was a total idiot.  Even if it is tresspassing I'm pretty sure if I seen a dad and his little 3 year old fishing in late april just before dark I wouldn't tell them to leave.  I'm sure others have encountered this and was wondering how you guys dealt with it?  I'm not big on confrontations, especially with my son, so I just left and asked him if he was happy that he made my son cry. Haha, throw a little guilt his way, why not?"
460267,John Bacon,2010-04-27 02:52:00,3277,Generally speaking navigable waterways are public.  There are some exceptions such as Long Point and the south end of Scugog.  I doubt that he had the right to kick you out but wouldn't be 100% certain.
460270,DRIFTER_016,2010-04-27 02:55:00,10439," I gather you were fishing from a boat, right? If so you were not tresspassing. You would have been tresspassing if you had been on the shore or docks though (if it was private property). If it happens again just pull out your cell phone and call the police right in front of him to complain about being harrassed while legally fishing. The only way people like this will learn is if they are instructed by a person in a position of power. If the police refuse to do anything dial up the MNR and lodge a complaint with them."

The owner came out of the cottage yelling at the top of his lungs for us to get out of there we were fishing in his back yard, his water.

I was fishing prior to boats being placed and they told me to leave or they would call the police. I offered my phone...and then told him to look up the Fish and Wildlife Conservation Act online while he was waiting for the police and see what it says about harassing anglers. I waited almost an hour for the police to show, good thing the pike were biting. Him and i talked...the officer was aware of the law for waterways...he asked if I would leave to keep the peace...I said no...that I had a duty now to stay, if I left it was a loss to all anglers. He said..""Okay, how about in a half hour you go then at least it looks like you left on your own and this idiot will leave me alone."" I agreed as long as he reminded the marina manager he did not own the water. We talked fishing for a bit..I think he was trying to make it look like we were having a serious discussion..lol.

It's the same way with man-made lakes - you can't float on the water above the land that is owned by someone else, otherwise you're trespassing. (e.g. old quarries that have been allowed to fill with water).  I know of a small lake close to me that's been artificially flooded so is deeper than it once was.  This ended up creating a back bay that is privately owned because the lot lines didn't move when the lake was flooded.  It's a moot point, though, because the guy is clearly a jerk.

There is one park on Chemong where the owner will basically threaten to jump in your boat and beat you if you don't leave his docks alone.  A complete lunatic. Came up during a bass tourney last year.  The docks probably take up a 1/2 acre of water. This is the first I have heard of it on Pigeon, other that Victoria Estates.  I would like to know the name of the park. Maybe next time, take the opportunity to instruct your child about jerks and that you hope they will never become like the park owner.

Maybe I should start by asking everyone take a couple of minutes and have a look at the land or dock owner’s side of this. The only example I have; that can maybe explain some of their attitude towards fishing their docks; is the damage and or the injuries they have occurred by allowing fishing to happen that close. My brother’s boat; while at dock, has had the top torn a number of times by someone’s wild casts; which lodged hooks into the canvas top. The boat itself scratched and banged up against by fishers trying to free a snag. My brother has been woken up in the morning while sleeping in the cuddy of his boat, by a fisherman standing on the swim platform; trying to release their snagged line. His grand kids on two separate occasions had to be taken into the hospital to have hooks removed; due to unseen hooks that were stuck to the dock; under the water line. Now these people fishing at or around his dock; for the most part, were not there being idiots or uncaring. If there is/was an issue they; for the most part, would always apologized; but apologies don’t fix the damage or cure injuries they caused. What would you do if this was your dock or boat and there was a fisher, trying to get the snagged hook out of it; just to break off the line and then leave? Or every time that your kids wanted to go swimming off the dock; you have to go check and hopefully find the hooks stuck in the wood frame or the ladder? All I’m saying is that yea maybe we have the right to fish there but is it the right thing to do? No I’m not a dock owner; I fish out of my 16 foot tinny and I tow everywhere; but I have seen the results of allowing strangers to close to your stuff. I don’t think anyone here that has fished docks can honestly say that they’ve never been snagged and had to break off. I also think fishing docks from your boat; regardless of how good the fishing might be; is the same as dropping anchor, right beside the only other boat on the lake; give everybody their space. Ok guys let me have it; I know I’m on the wrong side of this thread; but wouldn’t you be a little concerned if it was your dock, boat or family?   Dan."

The exception is on rivers and constrained waterways where you're fishing off of docks regardless of where you are.  Also agree that its no excuse for the guy to fly off the handle, especially with a young kid in the boat.  That is ridiculous."
460482,Jer,2010-04-27 19:33:00,1426,"   One thing to remember...it's still only April...the marinas (especially at trailer parks) are for the most part, totally empty. There are no boats to damage right now."
460486,jimmer,2010-04-27 20:00:00,2730,"I wouldn't condone any angler damaging or destroying property and yes people should be aware of the dangers of leaving hooks around where there are swimmers.  And by no means should a boater tie up or stand on someone's dock unless in an emergency.  My biggest concern is that waterfront owners are beginning to have the attitude that they own the lake and if this continues we will start seeing a lake simcoe attitude in the kawarthas with diminshing water access.  Yes I own lakefront. It is a privileage to put a dock in the lake, not a right by the landowner.  Next thing you know the Gov will want to tax the docks we have in the lake (they did try this once already)if we demand that it is a private area. Can't people just speak respectfully to each other and work things out."
460491,DanD,2010-04-27 20:09:00,2223," True enough but there are still hooks to set in waiting for the summer's swimmers. My brothers personal best at his dock was about an eighty pound grandchild. The way he's been trying to handle this; is by explainning about the kids swimming and then try and point the fishers to another spot, where they may have some luck; his neighbor’s dock. LOL   Dan."
