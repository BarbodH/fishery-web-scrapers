460675,Paully,2010-04-28 01:47:00,712,  I watched one of his shows a few weeks ago and he was at some resort where they practice catch and release.. They were jiggin' for walleye when suddenly cronzy gets one on..  Cronzy: Well this looks like a great one for shore lunch!  Guide: actually we here at Blah Blah Blah like to practice catch and release..  Cronzy: you know how i love fresh fish  Guide: we release them so other guests can experience the great fishing for years to come  Cronzy: Ahh.. we're gonna keep this one thou.. i cant pass up a good meal  Guide: ???
460693,otter649,2010-04-28 02:20:00,118,    Actually at Jakes there is a menu item called Cronzy Shoreline Meal featuring walleye in his mix when I chatted with him I said pickeral (I'm from quebec I usually say Dore) so he corrected me said Walleye but was joking around......

460802,bigbuck,2010-04-28 13:51:00,2449,"I met Cronzy at the fishing show a couple of years ago and had a chat with him, he really is one of the most easy going down to earth guys out there. A spade is a spade with him, what you see is what you get. It was nice of him to give you guys a package each. I like his stuff and original FishCrisp. Good on him!! How does he look, he had a heart attack a few months ago??"
460856,fish-miester,2010-04-28 16:20:00,864,jeeeze i want some fish and chips now
460872,keiths,2010-04-28 17:17:00,30,"Good old Cronzy. Like he says, fish keep him thin. I say, more fish please. Never tried his coating, but this year for sure."
460900,otter649,2010-04-28 18:09:00,118,  He looked OK to me & might have lost a bit of weight (compared to being on TV) but he definitely has colourful language that you would never hear on his TV show. Wish I could have spent a bit more time with him but had to leave cause when we were in the parking lot he noticed some guy went into the restaurant & he said how did that guy know I was here (a charter boat skipper on Lake Ontario).........
