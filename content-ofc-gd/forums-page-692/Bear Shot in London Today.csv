461136,Jonny,2010-04-29 04:12:00,1380," The people who set this up have rocks in their heads. Densely populated areas are no place for wildlife larger than a rabbit, and sometimes not even those. Deer are cute until they start eating stuff they're not supposed to and causing car accidents. Beavers are cute until they start cutting trees off people's properties and plugging culverts with their dams. And a bear habituated to humans? That's a threat that people don't want to deal with at all. Wildlife in populated areas simply causes headaches.   I think what is needed is wildlife management; otherwise whatever benefit is seen from having these animals around is lost in the controversy of animals being nuisance animals.   The ""comeback"" is artificial. It needs to be controlled or halted altogether. The vast majority of people haven't got time to worry about the problems animals cause when they're not used to it."
461139,bigfish1965,2010-04-29 05:00:00,3382," Wow...what planet did that response come from?? First, wildlife management plans are not killing plans, they are plans to deal with the inevitable. Lets break this down a bit further...I will relate this all to St Catharines since thats where I am.  The beavers first came back about 12 years ago in very small numbers. Then successive years of heavy rain created a massive population increase, not only here, but province wide. You CANNOT GET RID OF BEAVERS. You can adapt. Niagara beavers do not make dams. They are bank beavers. Yes, they eat trees but since we don't have a forest management plan in place and since we artificially suppress forest fires here, the beaver may actually improve the over all tree health. The natural ecosystem is always the best manager. They do not eat trees more than 50 meters from the waters edge, so we can plot their likely movements and population threshold.  The coyotes-- the same rainy seasons brought an exponential increase in rodent and prey populations. We have few predators here. The hawks have probably increased their numbers by 4 times. But it was not enough. This opened the door for the formerly rural coyote to move in. Since St Catharines has a nearly perfectly aligned connection of green spaces and parks, the coyotes marched through. They adapted by going nocturnal. They multiplied rapidly due to the huge food source of rabbits and beaver and other rodentia. The coyotes in southern Ontario are all wold/coyote hybrids (or more accurately descendants of same). They habe the genetic code for greater adaptation and size. A cull is a total waste of time. It simply creates larger litters and since the mating pair rarely put themselves in harms way, does nothing to stop reproduction. Now, if people do not stop doing things like feeding pets outdoors, not cleaning up dog feces in parks, not using animal proof garbage containers, etc, there will be a big problem should the natural foods die off. They are already getting accustomed to us. If we do not ready the people for this, there will be problems.  The badger is a VERY recent returnee. It is endangered and may not be meddled with in any way shape or form.  The return of these animals is NOT artificial. It is adaptation and new found habitat and we 'green' more areas. They are simply coming back to where they were and are reacting to climate change as well.  BTW...if you don't think we have a big ecological and climate shift here, walk through a conservation area in your shorts this weekend. You will be picking out ticks for a week. Ten years ago there were almost none here...now they are every where."
461029,cram,2010-04-29 01:28:00,1733," I totally agree with you that its Bull....but, should the cops who aren't prepared for bears (and maybe had never seen one) have not err'd on the side of caution?  Wouldn't they have looked more idiotic if someone got hurt?  And i don't care waht anyone says.....a bear walking down the street in london is weird."
461031,misfish,2010-04-29 01:29:00,29133, You maybe on to something Cram.
461033,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2010-04-29 01:30:00,0," actually yes.  as i said, in both my personal and professional life.  what is your experience with bears?"
461037,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2010-04-29 01:33:00,0," also, i didn't say this. but if you think a bear should be shot simply because it was in a city, then yes, you are a moron."

461042,cram,2010-04-29 01:38:00,1733," If the local MNR was unequipped to deal with the bear, then.....?????"

461046,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2010-04-29 01:40:00,0," so when bears roam into dryden, are they shot?"
461053,Jonny,2010-04-29 01:43:00,1380, When they roam into Timmins they're shot. I was present once to witness it.
461056,FisherMike,2010-04-29 01:47:00,108,"Dr. Sal if you read ahead its been mentioned that london, ontario is not equipped to deal with bears.  there probably hasnt been a bear in town in 40 years.  so to answer your question, no a bear probably isnt shot if it wanders into dryden.  im guessing the MNR would use one of their many bear traps, but you should know that.  my buddy from school worked in manitouwadge as a bear trapper.  towns that have bears have ways to deal with bears.  towns that dont have bears typically dont have ways to deal with bears."
461060,cram,2010-04-29 01:49:00,1733," Lots of them near our cottage, and while i would say that they are totally harmless i have seen them (or one many times?) stomp its feet a bunch of times when bothered.  And my experience with bears is pretty limited (probably seen <25 in my life, aside from the garbage dump)"
461064,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2010-04-29 01:50:00,0, Oh really?
461072,Dara,2010-04-29 01:56:00,3052," You're not listening. I said they roam the school yards. You know, the same places as where the bear in london was shot. And you know what....it was right to shoot it. It should also be right to shoot them here. And don't give me this stuff about being prepared to deal with bears. if you call about a bear sighting you are told to stay inside till it goes away. We have all of 2 traps. Bears aren't supposed to be in cities. And city people with no bear problem shouldn't write the laws on how city people with bears handle them. But they do, and thats what gets us northerners upset. So we rag on you when you deal with the problem the way that we want to but you won't let us...cause we have to learn to live with the bears that you don't want shot"
461075,cram,2010-04-29 01:58:00,1733," Yes.  There was one that obviously learned some bad habits somewhere and was trying to bust into our shed for the garbage inside it.  I was trying to scare it away.  Your point???   That i shouldn't have bothered it, or that you don't believe it happened?  My friend had one come to his cottage and false charge (or charge and stop) his window - many times.  The dog was on the other side going bananas.   They called the ministry who i believe removed or shot the bear.  So, what's your point again...?"
461080,cram,2010-04-29 02:04:00,1733," I'm pretty sure 99% of us southerners don't know or care either way (not that we don't ""care"", but most people here have no idea TO care.  I am outdoorsy compared to 90% of the people i know, and even I didn't know that you have bears walking through the schoolyards)..  You guys are blaming the wrong people.  Plus, just guessing...does your city gov't decide how to deal with bears inside the city, or is it the MNR?"
461083,Muskieman,2010-04-29 02:05:00,2472,I heard that Bears can't run downhill... but this one certainly is. Looks like it's going pretty fast.  RFS

The problem I have is they are never held responsible for their actions. Case in point firing 19 bullets in a residential area at a suspect running away. Also firing bullets at a animal in an area close to schools that was posing no threats(unless of course you believe the released statement ""charged at a officer"")again in all my years of encountering bears one has never charged me. Believe what you want ,the world does need lemmings."
461092,bow slayer,2010-04-29 02:15:00,1074,  lets call the London Police to shoot them all and save the  rainbows.

461106,danc,2010-04-29 02:46:00,4677,"Bottom line here is that those of us that live in bear country have had many encounters with them and aren't afraid of them at all. Those of you that don't live in bear coutry are influenced by the media and beleive that a bear sighting might be the last thing you see before you die. Nonsense. I've seen hundreds of bears in my day. At most I consider them a nuscience, but never a threat."
461111,Dara,2010-04-29 02:49:00,3052,"   MNR, that is controlled by the same government that decided to take a payoff and cancel the spring bear hunt, which is basically the root of this whole problem. We went from 3 or 4 bears around in a year to something around 50. The police won't take bear calls any more."

The one that chased myself, and two gals, was in Banff between the Hoodo park campground and the river. They can run down hill... they just can't stop !!! (but we could) She rolled right down into the river and then we ran up hill.. passing the cubs she was protecting on the way up. That was 1976.. oh the memories!"
461122,bigfish1965,2010-04-29 03:02:00,3382,"There has been a massive shift in the last ten years in S. Ontario. First the beavers, then the coyotes, badgers and now bears. The moose are as far south as Guelph.  We have to get used to it and know that we just can't kill them as they show up. Dogs kill more people every year than bears. We are setting ourselves up by ignoring the fact that we are creating the problem, not the animals. We are still acting like the animals are not here and are now creating coyotes with little fear of man living right in major urban centers. Municipalities do nothing.  I am in the midst of a big Urban Wildlife program for Niagara. We have coyotes, badgers and beavers. We didnt have them 10 years ago....but as their population increases we are becoming a food source. This is setting us up for confrontation. It is very simple. We must adapt before the animals do...if the coyotes and bears see us as food suppliers, things will get bad very fast.  The growth of these animals is far beyond anything seen before. A Niagara coyote at 75 lbs is not unusual.  There really needs to be a massive education campaign to teach people who don't see these animals other than on TV what to do.  I don't know enough about what happened in London, but I do hope the cop gets a reprimand for the trophy pose. It was a terrible kill according to the report, taking several hours. There is a difference between a hunt and having to dispatch an animal for safety. The latter should never be celebrated....ever!  The animals are coming back...so we might as well get used to it."
460898,anders,2010-04-28 18:07:00,1168,"How often do bears attack people???  I think people are really quick to hit a panic button and become a hero...everyone is used to living in a bubble. What ever happened to just leaving it alone or just monitor it...the police were probably doing just that then had a pool, to see who will get to shoot it first.  And given the size of the bear....hardly a threat to a blueberry"
460926,DRIFTER_016,2010-04-28 20:15:00,10439," I haven't had a dangerous encounter with a bear yet. But at some point it will happen, it has to in the areas I frequent. I have been as close as 12"" to a 600# grizz and have been woofed, jaw popped and glared at by black and grizzly bears. I have had them sniffing at my tent in the middle of the night and fighting in a ravine in the camp ground and I have come face to face with a 1000# sow at 10 yards. It is very easy to determine a bears intentions within seconds. That big old sow ignored us completely and hug out right in front of me for almost a minute before ambling off into the woods (my hand was on my spray but I never felt the need to unholster it). Another time 2 cubs came out of the high grass 60 yards away, followed by mom!!!      It took her all of 2 seconds to see me and charge 1/2 way across the back channel and make it known that I wasn't welcome there. I backed off down the gravel bar and fished with my head on a swivel until ma and the kids left. I have had a couple of friends charged by grizzlies and it is a frightening thing for sure. My one buddy was out hiking with a buddy in the mountains in the Yukon. A grizz appeared 80 yards away as it crested a ridge. As soon as it saw my buddy it flat out charged looking to kill them!!!     He difused the situation with a .458 slug to the vitals!! His buddy who was unarmed and standing behind him got a gret picture of the charging bear at about 20 or 30 yards just befor it was shot. I have also seen a small black bear beat the living snot out of some idiot that was harassing it in a campground in Alberta. This was a small 2 year old blackie about 200#. The idiot had a bull whip and whipped the bear when it entered the camp ground. The bear didn't like this much and ran over, jumped on the moron and slapped him, then left. He deserved it and it was most amuzing to watch as the bear had him on his back and slapped him left and right with open paws. So yes bears can be dangerous and unpredictable and this little London bear could very well have advanced on the cop and just because it was little does not mean ""harmless"".  Most people are afraid of the unknown and a bear in their community is something to be feared because they don't know about bears or how to act in bear country."
460929,Dara,2010-04-28 20:41:00,3052,"I know people that have been attacked by black bears. Its not something you want to experience.  The government really needs to decide what comes first. people or bears. I guess they will leave that decision to when some kid is killed needlesly. So far we have been pretty lucky, but its only a matter of time."
460935,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2010-04-28 20:51:00,0,"what a joke. i have bear encounters yearly both in my personal and professional life. shooting this animal was a knee jerk reaction to an animal that posed very little threat to the public, by a public who are misinformed as to the dangers of black bears."

460964,bow slayer,2010-04-28 23:02:00,1074,"  the biggest problem here is believing any of the garbage that is spewed out of the mouths of the London Police Service. I have been around bears many times over my years and several were with in meters and have never been charged,they run away as fast as they can. Remember this is the same police department than ran through a neighbourhood firing 19 shots never hitting their target. If anything the people were at more of a risk from the cops firing away and then wounding a bear which ran off,from the bear itself.Another fine example of the LPD and their spin job."

460973,Jewelbee,2010-04-28 23:30:00,422,Well said!!! I have to agree. You hear of cases of deer being hit by cars and local humane societies picking them up to try to save them.(Not that i agree with it)  So it's ok to save Bambi.. but not Smokey???  My point is ..Why wasn't relocation even considered? Maybe it's time to reconsider the hunt? I for one would rather NOT have the bears relocate to Southern Ontario. (I live here) I like walking in the woods with my dogs and don't have to worry about encountering bears....(YET)

This is the first bear sighting in more than 40 years in London,  I guess tomorrow there will be 40 bears coming in from the north to invade our town, Once it's a daily occurence here (next week by some of your predictions) we'll be ready for them.  I'm guessing Bowslayer has had a few ""problems"" with the London Police by the sounds of it.  The point here is, there are VERY FEW bear problems in the south.  When they start to be more frequent there will be gear and people properly in place to deal with things in a more orderly fashion.  Until then there won't be, so deal with it.  Is this what we need?

The deal is that we live in our own city. i am in a city of 80,000 people. We have schools and children too. What we have is ""bear wise"" shoved down our throats. The bears walk around our school yards constantly. We have to keep the children inside. Our garbage gets ripped apart and we get told to keep it in the house. We are not allowed to shoot the bears. We are told to live with them. Then one single bear shows up in your town and the cops run out and shoot it. they take the easy way out that we would go to jail for, and pose for pictures like heroes. Come up here and deal with avoiding bears every day. Have one of your best friends spend 6 months in a hospital bed after being ripped apart by one of them while taking her kids out for a walk in the vacant lot behind the house."

I run after them with my camera for a photo op when I see one in the wild but they're always too fast for me. One of these days I'll catch up to one though. I was face to face with a huge male a few years ago but didn't have a camera with me. Literally 3 feet away. Face to face. Man I hope to get that chance again.

460796,FisherMike,2010-04-28 13:33:00,108,its not just that theres a private school there.  there is also a high school and a childrens mental health hospital all very close to eachother.  its a shame that the bear was shot but bears in london is extremely rare and its not something that probably any london police officer has ever had to deal with.
460804,bigugli,2010-04-28 13:54:00,6138,"So again, if the officer was not qualified to deal with the situation, where was animal control and the MNR? Who cares if it was near one school or a university., A hospital or a nursing home? What is the difference between a community up north and in the south. The only difference is 10X the voting power.  Bears are cute up north but a menace in the south. Hypocritical period."
460816,FisherMike,2010-04-28 14:23:00,108,"the difference between a community up north compared to down south is up north is bear country.  police, animal control and the MNR up north live with and deal with bears on a regular occasion.  like i said with the london police,  even if animal control was called, i guarantee there is not an animal control officer in london capable of dealing with bears.  im not at all saying that human safety is more important down south compared to up north whatsoever.  the simple way to put it is people up north are more educated on bears and bear safety compared to people in southern ontario.  i deal with bears almost daily on my job up north.  if i see a bear up north im typically not too concerned.  that bear is doing its daily routine in its typical habitat.  if i was fishing in london and saw a bear it would be a completely different story."
460818,troutologist,2010-04-28 14:26:00,951,"That ""hero shot"" they are publishing is dispicable.   NIMBY....welcome to a common occurence in a large portion of ON, here's hoping misguided political activists are shown the consequences of resource management in the absence of science.  Imagine the funding cuts for CO's if the MNR had to start implementing Bear Wise in Southern Ontario...."
460821,danbouck,2010-04-28 14:32:00,4380, In case you missed it
460823,Dara,2010-04-28 14:34:00,3052,"  My daughter was walking to school with some friends and had to turn back because of a bear. Why can't they just keep the kids in school till the bear leaves the area. No need to kill a poor bear just because the kids want to play in the school yard. You will just have to learn to live together. Stay out of the bears way. A tip for you, bears smell bad. It can be a good warning that they are around. Your children should be taught this at an early age if you want them to get to an old one.  PS Have your local MNR and police get some bear traps. Sounds like you are gonna need em"
460826,Dara,2010-04-28 14:39:00,3052,  The bear was near 3 schools. Possibly they should educate them about bears in the school while they wait for the animal control officer to show up. Or would the kids rather watch the cop shoot it?
460827,cityfisher,2010-04-28 14:42:00,959,classic one of the pics shows the cops on a bridge with a sniper and a spotter .. Im sure the bear was ATTACKING them from 500 yards...
460828,FisherMike,2010-04-28 14:43:00,108,im sure they will educate the kids about bear safety now.  my main point here is that there hasnt been a bear in london in many many many years.  this is not the norm.  im sure bear education/control is about to change in southern ontario.
460844,jjcanoe,2010-04-28 15:47:00,744," Why does no one understand that this is NOT a daily occurence here in the south?  Should we get hire a lion tamer just in case one shows up?  How about some depth charges just in case there is a rogue Nuclear sub in the river? Are you going to pay for the traps.  How about all the people walking around in Springbank Park should we have locked them up so the bear could just wander away? I guess you haven't heard yet about the MNR funding cut that have been happening for the past 10 years or so    Again, the animal control around here doesn't have equipment to deal with anything larger than a pitbull around here, that would be many hours spent waiting for a control officer from the appearently ""bear infested"" north to arrive    The officer who was charged was about 40 ft away from the bear. I guess you've never played any computer war games where a sniper covers the troops on the ground!  jjcanoe"

460849,DRIFTER_016,2010-04-28 16:07:00,10439,"  Oh ,but it will be the way they are expanding their numbers and range."
460853,Dara,2010-04-28 16:13:00,3052,"  EXactly. It was never a common occurence here 10 years ago either. We were told to adapt to it. It is becoming a daily occurence in the south. You must adapt, you can't just be killing all the bears.  And I am not being sarcastic. If you want sarcastic, wait till you get a few more bears down there and all of a sudden there is a spring hunt again."
460857,misfish,2010-04-28 16:20:00,29133," One of the main reasons they are popping up where you wouldnt expect them.  Also,if you think thats the only bear you got,think again.Where theres one,there are more.London and surounding area has lots of forest and bush.Dont kid yourself that they aint moving in."
460889,shane,2010-04-28 17:57:00,652,I don't know why everybody seems to be afraid of these bears so much.  I've had quite a few bear encounters over the years and usually all I see is their back-end as it's running away from me.  A couple times I've had them look at me.  And then they turn and run away. I actually look forward to the bears moving down here.  Maybe they will keep some of the people away from my fishing spots.
460543,FisherMike,2010-04-27 22:07:00,108,i just heard on the radio that police just shot a bear in west london today.  thats pretty shocking news for london.  i guess a lot of the boars from the bruce peninsula are moving further south to establish their own territories.  pretty crazy!!
460547,DRIFTER_016,2010-04-27 22:23:00,10439,"  Yep, that's what happens when you stop hunting and the population expands unchecked. FYI it was weak knee'd polititcians down in South Western Ontario that brought about the demise of the spring bear hunt, so all bears that show up down there should be forwarded to your local politician so that they can take care of the cuddly little teddy bears."
460550,misfish,2010-04-27 22:28:00,29133,"Just watched this. They say the bear was going,I say going, to attack a police officer.  Yeah ok.  Where was the MNR on this one? Couldnt tranquilize/trap the bear and replace it somewhere? JOKE.  Can you believe the cop even posed with the kill.SICK.  Well said Drift."
460592,Muskieman,2010-04-28 00:01:00,2472,That's funny ... I just looked it up and apparently it's a passer-by from Alberta that shot it.  here's the picture.    RFS

460609,Muskieman,2010-04-28 00:25:00,2472,"a ""Bear"" is also a Cop...  so the Bear could be following a Boar or a Bear... technically a Boar is also a Pig...  so this could mean that the Pig is following the Boar It's 'kinda like the Son of a Birch or Son of a Beach thing. RFS "

460616,walleyejigger,2010-04-28 00:37:00,876,"AT LAST!!!!! our plan is working....mmwwwwwaahahahaha  if i had my way many more would be heading south, see how they like it, lookin at the size of it calling it a boar isn't deserving, just call it a bear or male bear, or kitten, just wait till the actuall big boars start roamin around your neighbourhoods and schoolyards, then be told its your fault for having bird seed out or not keeping a weeks worth of garbage indoors"
460617,bigugli,2010-04-28 00:37:00,6138,"I think it's a good thing that bears are returning to Southern Ontario. They were native down here as well. Seeing as urban folk don't want to see them hunted, they should learn to adapt to having bars and yotes in their backyards. Waiting to see if some urban survivalist type will try to pull a Crockett and ""grin a Bar to death"""
460627,Dave Bailey,2010-04-28 00:48:00,1641,"I highly doubt that a bear is going to get that far without being spotted earlier, same as with the one a few blocks away from me last year in Pickering, and the one a couple of years ago in Newmarket. To me a more likely explanation is that disgruntled hunters are capturing and releasing them near urban areas. People like these for instance."
460632,DRIFTER_016,2010-04-28 00:53:00,10439,  That's true!!!! There are hardly any in downtown Toronto. If there were there wouldn't be so many homeless people and pan handlers there.

460652,misfish,2010-04-28 01:19:00,29133, enlighten us DanC.  I would think a bear walking down yer down street would the norm.
460653,Dara,2010-04-28 01:20:00,3052,"  A bear could never survive in downtown Toronto. Too many people are armed and would shoot it on sight.  As far as the London bear goes, I see no need to have shot it. They could have just watched it and it would have wandered away sooner or later. just don't feed it. Thats how they tell us to do it here."
460656,Dara,2010-04-28 01:22:00,3052,  I see them just about every day going to work. I work on an Indian Reserve though. It may be different in your neck of the woods

460695,Jonny,2010-04-28 02:21:00,1380," Right on.  We keep being told how to 'bear-proof"" ourselves. Time to start applying that kind of public education in Southern Ontario instead of shooting the poor critters.  Some people are fond of quoting to us here in the North, ""The bears were there before you were."" Well the bears were in S. Ont. before the big crush of people too.  (Or, as they are also fond of telling us, the cormorant explosion on Nipissing is just a case of a species reclaiming its traditional range)  Personally I think every nuisance bear trapped in Northern Ontario should be distributed by a lottery system to a Southern Ontario county."
