449909,kgeary,2010-03-30 16:10:00,82,We had a pretty good weekend First at Haydens hockey wind up he won the biggest trophy ( its all about the size of the trophy when you are a kid) then went to camp - arrived about 6pm Don Vanderweyst and his brothers were up to camp doing some ice fishing as well. they had the holes already drilled and were actually just heading back to camp. they weren't more than 200 yards away when we caught our first walleye. within the hour Hayden had a 36 inch pike.  the next day we went out about noon and the first fish was a 46 Pike Hayden has caught a lot of 40 plus pike but I think that is his largest pike to date. sorry if the pics are too big not sure how to make smaller    we had to leave early to attend Seannas figure skating windup where she won the biggest trophy for artistic talent and dedication.    the weather was perfect the fish cooperated and Seanna and Hayden finished off one great season and started the next.  If your thinking of ice fishing Nungesser you probably have about 2 maybe 3 weeks of good ice. contact me for current conditions.
449915,TJQ,2010-03-30 16:21:00,7806,That picture of him putting oit back is pretty awesome.
449924,AzuluSpookd,2010-03-30 16:45:00,348,"Awesome pictures, that is monster pike!! I'm still seriously considering going up there this year...  "
450049,Jer,2010-03-30 21:35:00,1426,You should add that first pic to your signature.  Awesome fish for the little guy.
450052,splashhopper,2010-03-30 21:41:00,2931," That pike looked like it was ""sad"" leaving the lad behind  Nice looking fish.... it looks like they had great fun too."

450146,Rizzo,2010-03-31 00:16:00,4754,and most kids get excited with a sunfish off the dock! I think this young man will have some higher expectations. Some great fish you're getting into
450230,TennesseeGuy,2010-03-31 02:07:00,957,Hayden took me out on the lake back in 2007 when he was still a bit reluctant to handle pike.  I guess having a seventh birthday allows a guy to man up.  Nice fish Little Man.  When cousin Mason was about the same age he insisted that he be allowed to shoot a merganser and Hayden's uncle insisted that Mason was going to eat what he killed.  Mason's plate was filled with fried duck that night and Mason was struggling to get it down.  Eventually he handed it to me under the table and I hid it.  We did it a few more times until Uncle thought he'd had enough.  Later I gave it to Jetson and he scarfed it down in a couple of gulps.  No harm.  No foul.  RE:  Seanna's trophy.  Too much emphasis on artistic talent.  Should let them hit.
450380,mepps,2010-03-31 14:48:00,1301,awesome stuff as usual Kevin!
450627,kgeary,2010-04-01 02:51:00,82,LOL Tennessee guy Your right they should allow a little body contact into figure skating.  I'll bet the fish will have a few memories to share as well.   Yah I snapped the release just in time. and she went straight on in - just perfect.  I forgot to mention One 36 inch pike we caught was quite thin so I thought it was an older female not in good health so we kept it. It turned out to be a male. It's not often you see a 36' male pike. pretty wild.  saw a few caribou but didn't go over to get close for pics.  it was a good weekend.  kg
451249,kgeary,2010-04-03 03:46:00,82,I was out to Nungesser this afternoon. Ice was in pretty good shape but it's been raining heavy for about 5 hours. will really knock the ice down.  Came up on some Caribou on the trail.  kg

460382,kgeary,2010-04-27 14:42:00,82,Just a little update the ice is out on Nungesser it went out friday the 16th earliest ice out anyone can recall.  took the kids sucker fishing on sunday and of course Hayden had to go check out the snake nesting site.  then we went to watch the walleye spawn last evening. it sure is fun watching those big girls Hayden tickled a few bellies His eyes were wide open at the size of a few One of them had to be 15 lbs at least.
