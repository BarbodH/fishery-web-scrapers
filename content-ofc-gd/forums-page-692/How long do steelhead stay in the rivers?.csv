460877,Mykester,2010-04-28 17:21:00,241,"Or do they just die, like most/all salmon?"
460882,Kinger,2010-04-28 17:34:00,351,"not all salmon die, the leaper goes back to the ocean/lake."
460883,SRT8 smoker craft,2010-04-28 17:35:00,1107,it depends on a bunch of things but most important is the weather conditions this year I would be willing to bet you will get drop backs into early june in some systems at their lower reaches a freind if mines GF caught her first rainbow on opener and it was still tight the anal vent was not even sticking out yet and it was a nice 7-8lb chrome hen definately a spawner .rainbow don't die off like salmon unless they are at the end of their life cycle they spawn a few times during their life I don't know exactly how many times they spawn .do a google search for a more in depth explanation.
460887,Mykester,2010-04-28 17:42:00,241,"Cool, so would I still have a shot around mid may? That's when my exams end and I'm willing to hit up a local river."
460903,SRT8 smoker craft,2010-04-28 18:38:00,1107,for sure and if there's no bows in the lower streches you could try for browns in the head waters .
460937,aniceguy,2010-04-28 20:55:00,1094,"they can live 7 years, in some southern streams they have been there into july, for the most part first good rain event any time now will push the vast majority out"
460961,Musky or Specks,2010-04-28 22:38:00,2710,I know some huge logjams that the backwater above them will hold steelies all summer until the high water comes back in the fall. They look like snakes by mid august and I don't bother them although I have been tempted when I see them sipping caddis flies in the evening
460975,Mykester,2010-04-28 23:34:00,241,"This part of the river receives virtually no fishing pressure, hoping to see some action within the next few weeks."
460986,justin s,2010-04-29 00:06:00,16,All depends on the rain but i have caught bows in late july!!
