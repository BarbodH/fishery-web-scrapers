Fish may not have been overly cooperative, but no white stripes. First, Lorne up at bat.    Now for Rob.    Also learnt a lot of new neat stuff over the course of the day. Thank You for a most enjoyable and informative day Lorne."

459459,hammercarp,2010-04-25 03:59:00,964,Bruce it was a pleasure. I thoroughly enjoyed myself. Bruce with one on.   Bruces dog peanuts was a lively addition to our group. Here she is helping herd the fish into the net.   Here is a chunky carp about to get released.

459578,Beans,2010-04-25 18:33:00,3339,"Great reports guys...Carp should be starting in the Kawarthas shortly...  Question for Lorne:  Noticed you landed yours using a baitcaster...can you use it on an alarm set-up like we do with our bait runners? Pressing the release button to ""free spool""?  Enquiring minds want to know..."
460450,wolfville,2010-04-27 17:29:00,396,"I'm pretty sure Lorne fished ""paylake style"" so he wasn't using a buzzer."
