460048,FlyGuy5,2010-04-26 20:24:00,101,Went back to the same spot on sunday. The bite was a bit slower than saturday but still hooked into 5 fish in 2 hours and I got myself another native brown again on the hairs ear!  
460049,FlyGuy5,2010-04-26 20:25:00,101,here is the brown!  
460052,Roy,2010-04-26 20:28:00,13728,I always thought the Ganny was a shoulder to shoulder spot at opening! Nice fish.
460057,FlyGuy5,2010-04-26 20:33:00,101,its is Roy but I'm able to access private property in which very few people are able to fish on this property so i'm very lucky!!
460316,rock34,2010-04-27 11:34:00,215,Nicely done man.  Sounds like you have a great spot there.  I have yet to bust out the fly rod for steelhead but one of these years its going to happen.
460323,Aaron Shirley,2010-04-27 12:08:00,655,"Very nice, love steel on the fly."
460438,FlyGuy5,2010-04-27 17:04:00,101,On Saturday I got my buddy who has never caught a steelhead on a fly rod hook into his first one. He has caught a lot of fish on his float rod but never a fly rod till saturday and I think it changed him as he wants to learn more about fly fishing for steelhead and do more of it! I've been doing it for 15 years of course not much else to do when you grow up in Port Hope!
