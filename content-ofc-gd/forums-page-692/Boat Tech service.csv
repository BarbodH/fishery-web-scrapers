461133,John Bacon,2010-04-29 03:46:00,3277,I dropped off a Minn Kota motor for repairs at Boat Tech in Pickering.  I showed up to pick the motor yesterday morning as it was supposted to be ready.  Unfortunately they motor was ready.  So the owner dropped the motor off at my house early this morning before I left for work.  It is nice to see that some places are still willing to go the extra mile to help the customer.
