459893,FlyGuy5,2010-04-26 15:36:00,101,Myself and a buddy were on the River at 5:30am. I've got access to private property on the Ganny and when we got there we were the only 2 people there. I've been fishing this spot for about 8 years now and it just keeps getting better and better. We fished 14 hours and hooked into 60+ fish between the both of us plus he got 1 navtie brown trout and I got 3. Here are some pic's enjoy!!

460441,FlyGuy5,2010-04-27 17:08:00,101,Its great to have a spot in which is private! hard to come by these days. Even still we get the same guy who comes every year and pretends to know the land owners. When he really doesn't. I've had to kick him off serval times you think he would get the hint.
