460994,fish-miester,2010-04-29 00:19:00,864,Hey guys and girls.. was just window shopping for rods online.. and well I came across the Cabelas MagTouch.. and well I have read reviews etc.. but was wondering if any one on here has ever used them ? or know any one with / thats used one.. Im tempted to order one of the 7'6 Flippin sticks as i like the idea of the handle.. or maybe even pick one up and test it the next time im down in the states.. (not sure when that will be yet)  thanks for any input guys  A fellow angler
