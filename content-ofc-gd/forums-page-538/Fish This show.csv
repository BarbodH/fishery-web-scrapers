We filmed a segment about the festival in the Boathouse Restaurant at Golden Beach Resort, awesome fish dinner. Nothing like fresh crappie and walleye done by a quality chef.  They are out on the lake tomorrow hunting down a prize tagged fish and enjoying the amazing spring bite for walleye and panfish on Rice Lake. "
