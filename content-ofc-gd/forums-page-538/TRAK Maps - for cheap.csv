I got a Trent Severn Canal (Chemong Lake to Trenton) Chartbook --- reg. price $130  They still had a good selection of Kawartha Lakes, Simcoe, Rice, Haliburton, etc.  Maps and chartbooks.  The flat maps and chartbooks are on the bottom shelf of the bookcase.  The rolled maps are standing up in a box next to the gov't map station.  They are located at 901 oxford St, in Toronto.  You can see them from the QEW on the southside between Kipling and Islington.  Fogh Marine  Cheers, Mark"
