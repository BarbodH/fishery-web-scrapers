I have had both the motors (4hp and 8hp) running and I now have $60 worth of fuel in my big boat. I am ready for whatever the spring/summer throws at me. Now I just have to ask my wife if I can go fishing. (I surrendered my man card 5 years ago on my wedding day).  Here is the step by step set up of the inflatable.  It all fits into a canvas bag (except the floor)  With a 28 lbs. thrust trolling motor. Stealth approach.  Paddles and all.  After partially inflating it I put in the floor.   Then pump it ""drum tight"" with the foot pump.   20 minute set up time.  Here is my 1984 Evinrude 8hp. The inflatable is rated fopr 10hp.   Here is the punt boat.   It is light but I added bar-b-que wheels to make it easier to move around.   And here is the 1986 4hp with integrated tank I use on the punt. I have re-built the transom on it but I think it is only rated for a 5hp. I will try the 8 on it this year.   Anyone want to go fishing? You have to ask my wife though lol."
