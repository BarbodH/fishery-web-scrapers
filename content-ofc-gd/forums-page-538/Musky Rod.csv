583986,mike rousseau,2011-05-17 04:35:00,4661,I currently have a St.Croix trolling rod for musky and I'm looking fir a second trolling outfit for the wife...  I'm wondering if anybody has positive feedback on any other brand rods...  I like St.Croix for bass and walleye... But there musky stuff seems to be crap... Everyone I know who fishes musky with them has had the eyes fall apart...  Anyway... I'm looking for an 8 foot rod... Heavy or x heavy... Looking to spend about 200 bucks...  Lets here those opinions fellas... I know you got em...

584034,outllaw,2011-05-17 12:42:00,1232,for 200 bucks you can buy 2 ugly sticks. one for trolling smaller baits the other a dipsey rod 10ft for fall big baits. these rods have foam handles which hold up better in rod holders trolling.
584037,Raf,2011-05-17 12:47:00,3495,"the 8' st. croix glass trolling rod is the best trolling specific rod i've found.  sometimes i wish it were 9'.  but outlaw is right, if you wanna save a few bucks get a heavy dipsey rod, it'll work for 95% of the baits out there."
