If any one has some ideas as where to go I would appreciate the help we have a boat so aren't looking to rent just some where that has good pike fishing we will even stay in a camp ground.  Thanks Chris"
584407,solopaddler,2011-05-18 08:43:00,8605,In that limited drive range your best bet at least for trophy fish imo is Georgian Bay Fishing Camp.  http://www.georgianbayfishing.com/

North Bay is about 3.5 - 4 hours from you. Kevin from LakAir may be willing to help you out. It would be about 5 hours for you."
584475,Live2fish85,2011-05-18 13:50:00,1633,Yea I was looking at a place right near Corbel which was right near Lake Nipissing. I would like to get up that way. Nothing like the North. I haven't done a whole lot of pic fishing before so if any one has some tips for this time of year it would be great. Thanks Nipfisher I was thinkinh of around that area as well.  Chris
