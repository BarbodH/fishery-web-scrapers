583979,Nipfisher,2011-05-17 03:41:00,2449,"Come to North Bay. Lots of good areas to fishj and camp. Talon Lake, Nosbonsing, Nipissing (maybe not in a canoe) Marten River. Provincial parks should have tent spots open. Where ever you go add some inches to Team 2. Don't forget to print off a logo and put the necessary info. on it. Welcome aboard."
