581671,Afraz,2011-05-11 04:49:00,250,"Them ""tomato"" plants look more like strawberries to me"
581674,fishinguypat,2011-05-11 06:30:00,547,"""tomato plants"" or marijuana?"
581761,l2p,2011-05-11 14:46:00,346,"Ive also bumped into my fair share of Tomato plots, one even had spent shotgun shells littering the place... needless to say we walked out of there really fast, maybe even ran as we got closer to the car haha."
581768,kemper,2011-05-11 15:07:00,2232," But wasn't it worth it? I mean where else can you find those fish that ""don't exist""..."
581804,l2p,2011-05-11 19:04:00,346,"So very true my friend, those fish are deffinatly well guarded hah."

584006,siwash,2011-05-17 10:44:00,683,  Call the cops.
584105,Billy Bob,2011-05-17 15:03:00,5865, Let them find their own weed....
584359,chris.brock,2011-05-18 01:53:00,4053,"Up in Haliburton, while bushwacking, in October last year, we found a similar old tomato plantation. I was thinking this August, I'd grab my tilley hat, binoculars and ""Birds of Ontario"" book (not to look suspicious) and wander back through there"
584362,Dozer,2011-05-18 02:05:00,896,"Ddn't you hear what happened up in Haliburton some 5 years ago?  5 cotaggers were walking around in the forest when two guys apporached them with guns and held them hostage, only to let them go a day or two later, they called the cops and a huge plantation was found.  Careful with your footing Brock, these folks dont mess around."

580833,Whitespinnerbait,2011-05-09 01:29:00,2038,"The plan was to seek out and Discover a new Trout lake .............After climbing what seemd like Mount Everest , we spot a small stream ( all streams lead to Lake X )and follow it for a kilometer or so        Arrival at the new lake..        Just missed out on a Pileated Wood Pecker in action     As we make our way around the shoreline ......A couple of Specks got a little to close to my hooks       E A P....Extended Arm Pose       Heres were the Disturbing finds unfold....At the opposite end of the lake , theres a marsh in the distance as we near it...............TOMATO PLANTS were once Grow-Op there  Man what an Operation '' They  '' had going , once upon a time               Fertilizer pails 24 of them    Watering cans,jugs,bins Absolutely littered the place       This marsh was completely covered in Tomato Plants at one time.The only thing remaining was the Black Pots they were Growing-Op in .     Seemed like a lot of trouble and High Risk just to grow-op 500 or so Tomato Plants"
580842,Rod Caster,2011-05-09 01:36:00,5784,Nice fish. Yours trump mine.  That's funny about your special find...on our walk today we saw a few soil bags and some containers laying around as well.
580845,Roy,2011-05-09 01:37:00,13728,WOW! Fantastic fish though.
580852,irishfield,2011-05-09 01:45:00,26272,"I wouldn't be walkin up there in late August. They're not done growin them ""tomato"" plants!!"

580861,purekgw,2011-05-09 02:13:00,585,"yah if that stuff is around i dont think i would be messing around there to much people with ""Tomato Plants "" are very protective of there ""Tomato Plants ""  lol  nice fish tho!"
580862,spinnerbaitking,2011-05-09 02:14:00,1622,"Report it & maybe they'll get caught or move on, there's always next year SBK"
580863,Nipfisher,2011-05-09 02:16:00,2449,Is the market for tomatoes that good? Does the risky nature in which they are grown make them taste better?    Great post. Looks like some nice specks.
580871,Joey,2011-05-09 02:27:00,9122,"Beautiful fish and love the stream shots.  Total shame about the mess left behind.  Very disrespectful, tsk tsk.  They should be ashamed.  Joey"
580873,tb4me,2011-05-09 02:28:00,3295,"I can almost gaurentee they wont be back...if they wanted to return there, they wouldnt have left all that junk lying around...Dont ask how I know that either...lol. Its a long story..."
580886,splashhopper,2011-05-09 02:59:00,2931, was thinking the same t  hing
580892,Handlebarz,2011-05-09 03:19:00,3790,Nice specs and report. I wonder why they would go through all that trouble for tomatoes heck there are the new hanging tomato plants that come in the green bag just hang them and for get about them until they are ripe sounds alot easier then driving and hiking to grow a garden.
581018,addy79,2011-05-09 15:59:00,573, lol
581022,johnnyb,2011-05-09 16:08:00,3413,Nice walk....nice fish....too bad about the mess

581071,Cast-Away,2011-05-09 18:27:00,790,"That was quite the weekend adventure that you had! Why would anyone grow ""potted"" tomato plants?   ;)  :D"
581072,bubbles,2011-05-09 18:37:00,591,  For resale of course.........
581079,Rob,2011-05-09 18:50:00,467,1000 bucks a tomato plant is a good haul for 500 plants Rob C
581086,mbosh1980,2011-05-09 19:09:00,349,What did the cops say when you reported it?
581088,Headhunter,2011-05-09 19:18:00,5703,"On the up side, you have an endless supply of white buckets to choose from, when and if you need them! HH"

581115,eman,2011-05-09 20:40:00,101,beauty specs!  too bad those entrepreneurs couldn't clean up their trash. All that plastic and mess will take way beyond our years to decompose.
