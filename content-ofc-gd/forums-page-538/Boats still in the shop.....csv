This might be the first time I've missed the walleye opener on Nipissing in, well, I can't remember...."

584078,Mike01,2011-05-17 14:19:00,378,"My boat thats in the shop is a starcraft to, thats kind of ironic.  I might have to take you up on that offer.  I may just take my kayak out from my mom's, she lives right down from sunset point directly on the lake."
