584145,Mike01,2011-05-17 16:16:00,378,"haha, that's pretty funny, I don't think the yanks could handle us!"
584153,redskullz,2011-05-17 16:38:00,55, Yep...ebay rules for tackle! I am patient and bid on lures i want. Sometimes the prices are incredible. I bought 14 mepps Xtra deep #2 spinners this year for trout fishing for $24 shipped....also bought many rapalas for less than $3 each shipped. Some of the hard to find older lures though....rapala HJ-14 in orange crawfish seller wanting $30 for example....LOL
584157,redskullz,2011-05-17 16:43:00,55,"OH yeah...about cross border fees. If a package is stopped in customs(seems to be random...out of 500 packages from the US i have had maybe 10 that i had to pay customs fees on) you will be subject to customs fee if delivered by USPS. The amount of fees depends on a percentage of the declared value of the goods.(somehwere around 15%) If UPS is the carrier and the package is stopped in customs, there is a $30 handling fee in addition to the customs fees.(i wont bid on an auction if UPS is the only way they'll ship)"
584170,DRIFTER_016,2011-05-17 17:29:00,10439,In Canada there are several good choices. As stated there is The Fishin' Hole and LeBarons (although their online ordering is a PIA) and Cabelas Canada. There are a bunch of specialty stores across the country doing business online as well ie. Centerpin Angling
584244,Mike01,2011-05-17 21:33:00,378,"Well, the order came in today.  From California to North Bay in about 24 hours, I couldn't believe it.  Got dinged with an $18 ""brokerage fee"" but all in all I'd certainly order from them again."
584266,glen,2011-05-17 22:37:00,2641,$18 you got off lucky.  I had two lures cost me $44 at the door.
583150,Mike01,2011-05-15 13:16:00,378,"I'm looking to order some new tackle and hopefully save a few bucks!  I know we used to have a deal with All American Outdoors, but unfortunately they are no longer in operation.  So what is your favourite site, preferably tax free.  I know this has been talked about a couple times but could't seem to find any threads.  Thanks Mike"
583165,hawkeye,2011-05-15 14:15:00,162,"Bass Pro will skin you alive with shipping and their ""brokerage"" charges.  Cabelas is no free ride either see the following Merchandise = $44.99 Fee = $3.50 Postage = $13.95 Tax = $16.82 ORDER TOTAL = $79.26 almost eighty bucks for a pair of sandals, but they were exactly what I needed so I eat the costs  Neither are tax free, sorry I couldn't be more helpful"
583167,Handlebarz,2011-05-15 14:18:00,3790,Four musky inline baits I would suggest http://www.handlebarzmuskylures.com/Welcome.html  They might have excellent pricing for OFC members  I would suggest that you look up http://www.anglerschoice.ca/ Dave is a good guy and has just bought a store in Wallaceburg Ontario and has alot more then what is on his site.He makes the Angler choice baits.  Also http://www.waterwolflures.com/musky/ Mike makes some amazing plastic baits for musky fishing as well as Bass these are tops in my books for musky tubes and simm baits. his Bass site is http://www.bassmagnetlures.com/
583170,MCTFisher9120,2011-05-15 14:31:00,3761,Tackle Warehouse  http://www.tacklewarehouse.com/  Also I plan to use Tackle Direct  http://www.tackledirect.com/
583172,Cudz,2011-05-15 14:33:00,2652,Really depends what you are looking for.  Crankbaits such as big os or warts and lipless is a no brainer.  Toplak's is by far the best.  Keep orders under $40 and there is no duty and shipping is only $3.99. It gets here fast tyoo.
583175,danc,2011-05-15 14:41:00,4677,This might be of some interest to you.  Cabelas $5.00 shipping
583176,Mike01,2011-05-15 14:45:00,378,I'm looking to buy a couple of reels as well as some larger musky type baits.  The $5 flat rate is US only.
583178,danc,2011-05-15 14:49:00,4677," Didn't notice that. I get my Cabelas orders shipped to a Minnesota address at the border and go pick it up from there. It saves me a few bucks. Well, perhaps not with the gas prices today."
583198,Mike01,2011-05-15 15:17:00,378,"I just ordered a Shimano Cardiff 400a and a 300yd spool of 65lbs power pro from tackle warehouse, shipping was only $15. And best of all NO TAX!!!"
583218,irishfield,2011-05-15 16:02:00,26272,".. don't worry, they'll get the taxes and another $5 for handling out of you, when you have to go to the post office to pick up the parcel!"
583227,Mike01,2011-05-15 16:15:00,378,"buggers!!  it's coming UPS so hopefully they'll drop it off at the house and I should be good to g   haha...buggers, thanks OFC for the filter"
583228,irishfield,2011-05-15 16:16:00,26272,UPS... you're a real glutten for punishment !
583229,Mike01,2011-05-15 16:19:00,378,we don't actually have UPS up here so it will be someone else who delivers it
583231,SlowPoke,2011-05-15 16:26:00,2984, UPS eh? Start stretching your jaw muscles; you may avoid an injury when your jaw hits the floor when Mr. UPS asks you for brokerage fees and taxes.
583233,irishfield,2011-05-15 16:27:00,26272,"What do you mean there's no UPS in North Bay... One of their x-drivers lives in Temagami.  If it comes across the border UPS.. they'll add brokerage to it, pay the taxes on your behalf and expect to collect them at your door unless it was shipped via their premium service that includes brokerage to get it quickly to your door. Then they mail you a tax collection notice afterwards. Fedex does that as well.... unless you get lucky and they consider it of so low a value it's not worth processing."
583240,g_clot,2011-05-15 16:43:00,104,"Doesn't Cabela's have a Canadian site now without all the same duties, taxes etc?  Haven't ordered from there from I assumed that it wasn't a pocket killer anymore."
583259,Cudz,2011-05-15 17:32:00,2652,Don't expect to get off that easy.  I bought from them a $69 reel once and when all was said and done it cost me $94 despite only being quoted $10 for shipping.  Our border adds a handling fee(like $7.50 to open the box I guess)??? and some duty.
583283,crossover,2011-05-15 18:22:00,172,I'd like to know too. The aforementioned places don't carry HJs and seperate Mepps.
583293,crossover,2011-05-15 18:48:00,172,Through some googling I found this site. Since it's Canadian you don't need to deal with all the extra fees.
583313,Mike01,2011-05-15 20:24:00,378,"i think its kind of luck of the draw, there have been times where i've had to pay extra and times when i've just signed and said have a nice day."
583324,PikeMolester,2011-05-15 20:54:00,428,Ebay FTW! Ebay stores are usually so fast and minimal to no fees n stuff from my experiences.
583634,Keenan,2011-05-16 14:50:00,59,
583982,crossover,2011-05-17 04:13:00,172,"I placed an order on some spoons and spinners yesterday on the Le Baron website. On the plus side, their prices are pretty good, and have a huge selection. On the downside, it's a pain in the ass needing to fill out all the information for each item rather than an ""add to cart"" feature, especially since my computer doesn't load pdf files online. They also don't give you shipping estimates up front, and I didn't get a confirmation email, leaving me in the dark. If all goes well I'll have no problem ordering again, but they need to improve their online shopping."
583995,solopaddler,2011-05-17 09:23:00,8605,In general Cabelas is where I buy a lot of my stuff.  If you live close enough to a border you can have your stuff shipped to the closest UPS depot in the States. Or alternatively maintain a mailbox at one of those commercial outlets. It's inexpensive and a real cost saver if you order a lot of stuff online.  Besides Cabelas Outlet Bait and Tackle always has some unreal prices on stuff. Very dangerous website for me.  http://www.overstockbait.com/default.asp  Sierra Trading Post is also good. Lots of good deals there and a great company to deal with.  http://www.sierratradingpost.ca/
584018,Mike01,2011-05-17 11:38:00,378,"The overstock bait site looks pretty good, definitely some excellent deals to be had.  There was UPS in NB a while back but I think they just contract it out now, I haven't seen any big brown trucks driving around these parts for years.  The UPS website says that my order is supposed to come in today so I'll give you all a report on what happens."
