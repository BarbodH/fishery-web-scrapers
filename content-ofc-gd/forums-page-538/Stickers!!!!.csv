584025,The Urban Fisherman,2011-05-17 12:15:00,2050,"Hey Gang - My dad has a small home business doing everything from custom wooden furniture to stickers, decals and trophies.  He donated a whole bunch of car decal/stickers for the Fish-A-Thon.  All of our participants will get one automatically, as will our sponsors and those who make prize table donations!  We'd love to get the word out so if you'd like one please feel free to contact me.  A small pledge donation would be GREATLY appreciated, even a dollar or two helps reach our goal!  The ball is rolling and things are coming along well for the 2011 Season!    Averie made a pledge and got one on her bedroom mirror!    Thanks again for all the solid support - you guys rock!  Cheers, Ryan"
