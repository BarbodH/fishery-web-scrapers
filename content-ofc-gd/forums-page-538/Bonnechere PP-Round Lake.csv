The park is located where the Bonnechere River enters the lake. The river had lots of smallish pike and there is a marshy delta at the mouth where I got some largemouth, The lake produced smallmouth, some walleye but good sized ones in the evenings and dad got a couple of lakers wire lining and I believe a whitefish as well. Dad liked using good sized chub minnows for walleye and in looking for small creeks to place the traps we hit on several small feeder creeks with excellent spec fishing for pan sized 10/12 inchers. If it is still much the same the women will love the great beach, take a canoe the river is a great paddle and the fishing in the lake is fairly tough but some good sized ones."
