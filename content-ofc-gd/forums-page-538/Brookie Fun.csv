583177,hammercarp,2011-05-15 14:45:00,964,Thanks Mike You brought back many good memories of fishing for those little gems.

583194,Mike01,2011-05-15 15:12:00,378,absolutely beautiful
583197,MJIG,2011-05-15 15:17:00,227,"Like others, I'm suddenly yearning to walk the creeks again after seeing this. Great shots!    --"
583210,Mike Pike,2011-05-15 15:38:00,1332,"I have never seen small stream brookie shots like that before!  That's quite a talent you have, Mike, first to catch 'em and then catch 'em with the lens.  Terrific stuff.  Sounds like a lot of effort but boy, was it ever worth it!"
583213,Victor,2011-05-15 15:43:00,1609,Looks like you are getting the hang of those underwater shots. You definitely had a better morning compared to us haha.
583217,Joey,2011-05-15 15:59:00,9122,"Really great shots, I love the first one the best.  I'd also like to know what camera you are using!  Joey"
583383,highdrifter,2011-05-15 23:07:00,2534,I'm sick with jealousy...  disgusted actually..  Well done Mike!!

583406,Dusky,2011-05-15 23:57:00,310,Truly amazing!! treat to watch
583481,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2011-05-16 02:21:00,0,sweet shots!  nice to see fish pics where such great care is taken in handling such a fragile species as opposed to rolling them in dirt etc. keep 'em coming!
583613,baitrummer,2011-05-16 14:10:00,24,Excellent session Mike. Some great photo's. Your inspiring me to do some brookie hiking
583625,Homer Is King,2011-05-16 14:28:00,305,Great report.  Those are very unique photos!!!
583666,ctranter,2011-05-16 16:23:00,543,"a fantastic report as always, Mike.  Your underwater shots from the DSLR really tempt me to invest in an underwater case.  I can't imaging how weird it feels to intentionally dunk a 2000$ camera haha.  Great report, great fish, great pics.  Glad to see you are healthy as well"

583792,BillsTheBassMan,2011-05-16 21:00:00,932,"Mike,  This is my big fishing passion too - it's an amazing way to fish.  You either get it or you don't . . . if you hear ""those fish are only 8 inches!"" then that person definitely doesn't get it.  I've managed to pound a few rivers and a fair amount of streams this year and it has only renewed it as my favourite kind of fishing.  Amazing.  Do you fish anything lighter than a 5ft to 5'6"" ultralight with 4lb test?  Thanks for all the great shots and taking the time to post this.  I will have one coming up soon (though my pictures have been pre-trumped by you!).  Cheers, Ryan"
583860,MJL,2011-05-16 23:41:00,2427,"Thank guys   Lorne, I'm hoping to get the camera working underwater for the carp...Hopefully it doesn't involve snorkeling in Hamilton harbour   Hey Joey, I'm using a Canon 40D. Glad you liked the pics   Chris, the only thing more awesome than dunking a $2,000 camera underwater is dunking one costing $10,000+  For me it's a toss up between the Nikon D3S and the Canon 1D Mark IV for my next camera...Obviously you'd need 2 just for a backup   Ryan, I actually used to be a lot like that. I figured anything that didn’t grow 10+lbs wasn’t worth fishing for which is probably the reason why I never really fished for anything other than steelhead or carp.  After taking up small stream fishing a couple years ago, it really opened up my eyes to things I never really knew or thought about.  It has enhanced some aspects in my other fishing as well - Like stalking carp in the shallows or fishing water I’d never normally think to fish for steelhead. You pay closer attention to stealth and the smaller details in finding the fish.  I find fishing for those tiny trout more difficult than steelhead in many respects.  For me, the journey involving research, recon, hiking in thick bush, dealing with blood-sucking insects and snagging up on something almost every cast adds a whole new dimension to my fishing.  For tackle I'm currently using an old 5’ Shimano stimula rod I got for $20 at the fishing show more than 10yrs ago.  The reel is spooled up with 4lb mono...I figure I’d have a better shot at getting my lure back if I snag up than with 2lb line. One day I'd like to get a 3-4wt fly rod and try for them that way.  Can't wait for your report.  Mike"
583971,LefroyFisherman,2011-05-17 03:04:00,602,Incredible shots! Beautiful fish
584054,Jds63,2011-05-17 13:19:00,1365,"It is now almost 40 yrs ago that my Dad would take me with him to the local streams for specks, i really miss it ... those are some great photos ... thanks for sharing"
584081,ehg,2011-05-17 14:31:00,2666,"Again an incredible post MJL!  The thing about this headwater fishing is that brookies are all over the province wherever an underground spring trickles out to start some creek or river. Getting to these spots usually involves brutal trekking through thick, overgrown bush, loaded with bugs, just to flick your spinner into a lil' pool to get that beauty fish. Being able to get those amazing underwater photos adds a whole new dimension to capturing those gems. Very worth the effort.  I remember last year you did a post and mentioned my past reports over the years of headwater brookies kinda inspired you to give it a shot. That is why i will always post a report if i go fishing (seldom these days). Would be hoping someone would notice the lures or locations and reap the rewards as well. No use being selfish.  One of the best all-time fish reports here. Thanks, Mike!"
583031,MJL,2011-05-15 03:00:00,2427,"I personally can’t think of any other fish prettier than a brook trout...Resident browns rank a fairly close second.  Brookies also live in some of the most beautiful pristine streams and lakes you can find.  The last little while I’ve become possessed in ‘mining’ for these little jewels in gin clear streams.  Last Sunday I loaded up my hiking pack with food, water, camera gear, waders + boots and my rod, and traveled the roads on my mountain bike.  With the bike, I could find the small ditches and streams impossible to see from a car.  The fishing wasn’t as great as I hoped but there were a few gems at the end of the trek to make the cramping legs worth it.        With rain in the forecast, I left home today at 6am for a full frontal assault on as many streams as I could fish before they blew out and turned to mud.  From medium-sized rivers to small ditches no more than 3ft wide and less than a foot deep, I scouted and fished whatever new spots I could find. There was no real plan or schedule to follow. It was just a day of reconnaissance and discovery and getting lost on dirt backroads - My compass really was screwed up  The brookies from one of the streams were amazingly coloured with fiery red bellies – They looked as though they were in full spawn mode    In one stream I caught a dozen or so small brookies that were a beautiful dark blue/purple colour.      The ditch they came from – Stealth was paramount   A silvery one I pulled from a hidden culvert...After landing PB chub after PB chub, I definitely wasn’t expecting it   A nicely coloured one   Some fish-eye view pics  I missed the shot but those red fins and spots are stunning   Smashed the spinner           Hope you enjoyed"
583043,irishfield,2011-05-15 03:11:00,26272,Jesus Mike... don't make me go back to walking the cricks. Haven't done that in 25 years.. but you keep posting these and I'm out the door!
583047,BillM,2011-05-15 03:15:00,17367,"Mike, awesome pics man! Are you using a DSLR in a underwater case by chance?  I've gotten a Aquapac for my DSLR, haven't had the nerve to dunk it yet though"
583050,danc,2011-05-15 03:19:00,4677,Awesome Mike. The photos are spectacular.
583055,Sinker,2011-05-15 03:23:00,8692,"Hey!! Leave my fish alone  I'm not sure if  you stopped by or not, I was out most of the day today.  Looks like ya had a good one!  S."

583080,ehg,2011-05-15 03:59:00,2666,Incredible underwater photos!  25 yrs. ago i remember catching little brookies in a ditch on the side of hwy. 115. Turned out they fed into Cavan River a trib of the Otanabee R.  Go figure?

583085,gil,2011-05-15 04:15:00,41,Brookies have always been my fave fish ....Bar none! They are absolutely the prettiest fish on the planet! Not only that but until you've had a speck  fried in a cast pan with potatoes and beans!!!....... You have not lived!!!   thanx a million

583104,solopaddler,2011-05-15 09:46:00,8605,Very nicely done and truly beautiful pic's Mike.
583121,Handlebarz,2011-05-15 11:44:00,3790,dang them are some amazing underwater shots.  I am with Wayne its been many years since I have done that and sure do miss it.  Great report
583125,The Urban Fisherman,2011-05-15 11:50:00,2050,Buddy these are awesome!  I might have to pack up the kids and take them for a walk in search of some of these little guys in the creeks around here.... Tanks for the post as usual - always love reading them!
583127,MJL,2011-05-15 11:54:00,2427," Wayne, there’s a few of the medium sized rivers I fish where you can comfortably float down them in a canoe...It’s great if you don’t mind hopping over a few hundred beaver dams along the way   Hey Bill, I was using my Canon 40D for the underwater shots – Above water I was using my Panasonic FZ18. I have an Ewa Marine U-B housing and got a 67mm adapter for the lens.  Without the adapter, you get strange reflections off the front glass port or you get tunnel vision   ...This is what it looks like when the adapter pops out of the front lens port...It's always heartbreaking when you flip through the pics on the computer and see these    If I had to do it over again, I’d probably get one of the EWA Marine housings with the flash compartment so I can stick a remote receiver inside for easier shooting.  Overall the outfit is fairly hefty and is generally a pain in ass to carry around on the streams…It’s also fairly hard to use and almost impossible to change settings for a lot of things.  For the price over a professional hard-case style housing, I can’t complain.  It's the most awesome feeling dunking $1200 worth of camera equipment in the drink   Shayne, I cannot confirm or deny that it might have been me...   Panther Martins have been my go-to lure for specks since I started fishing for them a couple years ago.  Funny thing is I’ve never caught anything on that particular one in the pics (silver with the orange dressing) until yesterday."
583128,12footspringbok,2011-05-15 12:00:00,459,Great report man! Theres some small creeks around my area that rumour has it hold some decent specs i just have to get off my butt and try it one day. Thanks for sharing!
583138,Stern Rules,2011-05-15 12:32:00,342,Nice pics. I always fish for brookies every year when I'm in New Brunswick. Can't wait to try my underwater camera for those this year. Now if I could just find the brookie spots around here.
583157,laszlo,2011-05-15 13:51:00,487,I'm hoping to get my first brookies on the fly this year. Nice job Mike!
583159,fishnsled,2011-05-15 14:02:00,3520,"  Fantastic shots and great report!!  If you need someone to lug equipment one day, shoot me PM. I use to take a $40, 000 video camera and stick it in the water, doesn't feel as bad when it's not yours. Never had a problem though."
