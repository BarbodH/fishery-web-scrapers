583351,Victor,2011-05-15 22:08:00,1609,all the lures look amazing Mike. Just like the others I can't wait to see the report of your trip.  Good luck!
583360,WeedLine,2011-05-15 22:19:00,322,Those baits look great! One of my go-to baits are the black Reaper tails too. I'm having trouble finding them lately. Thank god I have a pack and half left. Good luck on catching some giant gators. I'm sure those will get a few.
583385,solopaddler,2011-05-15 23:10:00,8605, They look great!    I bought all my reapers and cobra head jigs at ebait.com
583405,BillM,2011-05-15 23:56:00,17367,"Can't wait for the report Mikey, I'm sure you guys are going to lay an absolute beating on them (especially with the weather they've had up there this week).  Looking forward to the report bud!!"
583418,workwear,2011-05-16 00:14:00,592,hey mike yesterday we were fishing sparrow...i was using a three jointed silver belly storm lure......jerk jerk pause...nailed 5 of them before the rains came.....8 in top water baits ....might want to consider them..... good luck and all the best!!!
583496,Skud,2011-05-16 04:00:00,739,I'm just going to use a 4 inch Daredevil spoon the entire trip.
583497,irishfield,2011-05-16 04:06:00,26272,"Probably all you need Doug. Take a 6"" williams ""whitefish"" spoon as well (yellow design on silver). Mine worked really well for early pike a couple weeks back until I flung it into the bay !"
583499,corvette1,2011-05-16 04:18:00,1765,mike they look awesome can't wait for the pictures you guy's have a great trip
583612,Skud,2011-05-16 14:08:00,739,Don't you love those casts. For a second you think you made an awesome throw until you realize the line is hanging only two feet from your rod tip. Lost more than a few lures that way.
583990,spinnerdoc,2011-05-17 05:55:00,556,"Good luck on you trip Mike, as everyone has demanded already....the report after , really lookin forward to it.  Stay safe and tight lines"
583992,solopaddler,2011-05-17 08:46:00,8605," You should be coming yourself!!  You will be missed. I'll drink my first real beer since Christmas in your honour.    Never had any luck at all with anything made by Storm.  Maybe they deserve another look.  There's not much doubt subtle baits will work well.       Doug, we're going to have some fun up there buddy."
584030,lookinforwalleye,2011-05-17 12:34:00,4399,"I wish I was going with you Mike I had the chance but dang Gordon Lightfoot got in the way , can`t wait to see the report!!!  Come on September!!!"
584116,flash67,2011-05-17 15:22:00,28,Can I buy some off you?? Too lazy to make my own.
584130,redskullz,2011-05-17 15:46:00,55,Very nice!! Thos johnson silver minnows work great for pike. A similar spoon that has caught me a ton of bass and pike is the Tony Acetta Weed Dodger...great old lure!
584507,farsider,2011-05-18 15:22:00,456,"Hey Mike,  Those look great.  Thanks for sharing.  I add a small piece of chartreuse reflective foil tape to the gold JSM.  I find it especially effective in tea-stained waters.     Have you tried glow-in-the-dark grubs as a trailer?  Some days that seems to make the difference for me.  I really like the strong glow of the Phenixcanada.com brand.  Also, regarding the Reapers, have you tried throwing it weightless on a plain straight-shank worm hook or a EWG.  It drops incredibly slow...similar to a slug-o.  Cheers,  Mark"
584518,solopaddler,2011-05-18 15:42:00,8605,  Very nice Mark! I do have a variety of prism tape as well.  To run the reapers and grubs virtually weightless I prefer to use large resin jig heads. They weigh almost nothing and I really like the way I can fish them.
583196,solopaddler,2011-05-15 15:16:00,8605,"I've been readying my arsenal for our assault on the Attawapiskat's pike population next week and thought I'd show you guys a couple things I did.  The bread and butter lure up there seems to be the larger 11/8oz weedless Johnson Silver Minnow spoon.  I had wanted a black nickel finish on the standard chrome spoons as I believe it'll be deadly.  Looking around for paint options I settled on a 2 step black chrome finish made by Dupli-Color. A translucent black paint followed by a clear coat. It's made for vehicle bumpers so it should stand up well on the lures I think.  After painting them I added silicone skirts, essentially creating monster sized ""Moss Boss"" spoons for pike.  I'll tip the spoons later with some kind of plastic trailer as well.  The skirt and trailer will bulk the spoon up creating a larger profile and allow me to work it through the shallows dead slow as the sink rate will be slowed...  Here's an unpainted chrome finish spoon with a skirt:    And a variety of other's painted with the translucent black chrome finish:        I'm also partial to 8"" Reapers and oversized musky sized twister tails. I'll have a bag of silicone skirts with me to dress these as well. Again the added bulk and flash of color will make these already effective baits even more deadly.  Here's a handful I've already dressed:         I'm just about packed and ready to roll. Look out pike, here I come."
583207,alphaalpha,2011-05-15 15:29:00,475,"Awesome looking baits, looking forward to your report when you get back!  Have fun!"
583208,4x4bassin,2011-05-15 15:34:00,1025,Looks good !
583209,msp,2011-05-15 15:36:00,1336,Those baits look sweet. Are you taking orders ? If so I will take a couple of the large black spoons. Good luck on your trip up north. I am looking forward to the report.
583219,fishindude,2011-05-15 16:03:00,220,"I can smell the slime already  Those all look VERY enticing. If I may ask Solo, how does one fish a weedless spoon?  Can't wait for the report. Cheers"
583220,lakerguy,2011-05-15 16:06:00,224,Nice! Have fun eh
583225,highdrifter,2011-05-15 16:14:00,2534,"Great holly...  lure porn!!  I see we have the same exacting standards...  If only I wouldn't have flunked OAC Biology..  Ya need some leaders to go with them baits?!  I've got what you need here dude.  Otherwise, have a most epic trip.  I hope to join you someday..  HD"
583232,addymark,2011-05-15 16:26:00,69,these are pretty sweet!   I should to to find my creative self and apply it to lure making!  probably save some money as well
583237,BillM,2011-05-15 16:37:00,17367," Slowly  We slammed them on Johnson Silver Minnows with big grubs on the end last year.  Really slows the drop as well, which helps when you are fishing in 2ft of water."
583239,Handlebarz,2011-05-15 16:39:00,3790,They look nice Mike had I known you were fixing up some baits I would have made you a couple flashabou skirts up for them.  Have a blast up there is should be amazing
583241,Sinker,2011-05-15 16:47:00,8692,"Those look good. If your in a pinch for the black spoons, just take a bic lighter to them. They will change colour pretty good.  I do it with williams jigging spoons to get that copper look. Some days its the cats meow!!  S."
583271,solopaddler,2011-05-15 17:50:00,8605," That's genius, thanks!"
583273,solopaddler,2011-05-15 17:51:00,8605, Actually yeah I could use some leaders. May not have time to grab them from you though.
583282,Tomcat,2011-05-15 18:20:00,395,"Just returned Thurs afternoon from a trip to Cabela's in Scarborough, Maine. Amongst other things, I picked up some Johnston Silver Minnows, some Dardevles, some Terminator titanium leaders and some Spro fluorocarbon leaders. Just wondering whether you would mind sharing your rationale for colouring your Johnston Silver Minnows black. Thanks in advance. Have a great trip."
583288,Roy,2011-05-15 18:32:00,13728,"Good job on the baits, Mike. I'm really stoked about the forthcoming report! If I was running those baits near or at the surface, like a Moss Boss, I'd prefer black to silver as well. Good stuff."
583289,PikeMolester,2011-05-15 18:33:00,428,Looks awesome. Can't wait to see the report when the damage is done.
583290,Spiel,2011-05-15 18:34:00,9065,  I can still recall the smell of paint fumes when he gave me a demo in the basement.....
583291,singingdog,2011-05-15 18:43:00,1047,"If you have access to big black zonker strips, try tying a magnum leech pattern on some of those jigheads: it can be a killer pattern on pike. The zonker strips are, IMHO, the best leech imitation going: much more action at slower speeds than plastics. Have a great trip."
583296,ADB,2011-05-15 19:07:00,444,Cool stuff Mike.  Go get 'em!
583300,solopaddler,2011-05-15 19:17:00,8605," Like any other lure fished at or near the surface it's all about silhouette. Black is best.    Thanks Roy, if the weather cooperates it should be a productive trip.    Naw, that was just a head rush from funneling down a beer.    I have to agree they're deadly.  I've got a bunch of these tied up with a couple different heads. All between 8 and 9"" long.    Also a variety of magnum sized chatter baits:    "
583303,4x4bassin,2011-05-15 19:29:00,1025,"I was fishing for pike in the Chapleau Game Reserve a couple years ago and used chatter baits like yours almost all the time I was there , couldn't keep the pike off of them . Really like that bottom one Mike , I think thats the ""one"""
583319,spinnerdoc,2011-05-15 20:45:00,556,"Awesome mike, you make me wanna start making spoons and spinners again, a question for you, did you have to soder the hooks on the spoon yourself, if you did do you mind sharing as to how? Again they look really good  Mike."
583322,solopaddler,2011-05-15 20:53:00,8605," So far I havn't caught a thing on chatter baits.  They do look good though. Maybe this'll be the trip.    No no, I just bought regular Silver Minnow spoons and painted them. Nothing that complicated."
583327,Whopper,2011-05-15 20:59:00,2174,Mike it's almost like you've been peaking in my tackle bag. Been packed since last weekend with the identical baits with the exception of the special finish on the JSM's  I can't hardly stand the wait
583347,singingdog,2011-05-15 21:52:00,1047,Nice looking jigs and chatterbaits. I use zonker jigs for everything from trout to musky with good results. These are tied on 7/0 hooks: musky like 'em.
