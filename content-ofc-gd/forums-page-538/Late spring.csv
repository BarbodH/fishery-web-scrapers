I hear that the farmers are a good 3-5 weeks behind their normal planting for this time of year. I'm wondering what you folks think about this and in turn, how this late spring will relate to fishing and how you would change your normal spring fishing patterns, to deal with mother natures cruel joke?

584164,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2011-05-17 17:11:00,0,up here the ice went out about 1.5 weeks later than i'm used to but on land trees budding and stuff seems to be not too far off normal.

584169,myot,2011-05-17 17:27:00,131,depends on what kind of lake your fishing on I know from personal experence Lake Ontario is about 2-3 weeks behind but things can change reel fast with warm stable weather  Dan

584271,irishfield,2011-05-17 22:42:00,26272,Ice out is right back on historical average on Lake Temagami. Average is about 8 days into May.. it went out totally on the 9th.  Not that it matters to me this year anyhow..
