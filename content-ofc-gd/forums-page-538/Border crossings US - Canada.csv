583994,pikehunter,2011-05-17 09:15:00,1659,"Not really so far off base BB. I am referencing certain particular media people and politicians who pointed their finger at the North and made a big fuss to stir up the kettle. The ones who caused all the trouble on 911 did not enter from Canada and as a matter of fact didn't some of them take flying lessons in the States?  Sure the States has the right to let who they choose in and in defence a tightening up of security is a good idea but they are focusing the attention on the wrong people. For God's sake the poster had more than a good enough reason to be crossing the border and the paperwork too. What he had happen to him was harasement. He was doing nothing illegal or made any motion as to an alternative reason to be going to a place he really had no desire to go to in the first place. And yes the Canadian Custom folks can be a P.I.T.A too!  Guess I'm also tired of those same people I am talking about making your friendly northern neighbours out as the bad guys, remember we lost citizens on that day too and life here has had some changes. I had a relative who luckily was not there that particular week as he worked in and around the Trade Centre every other week and stayed at the hotel across from there which also was also destroyed. Your homeland is not the only country having to deal with terrorists, Britain and Europe has had a dose of it and remember the Canadian plane bombed over Scotland. Do I watch CNN anymore? No.  Suppose that I am offended by some of the thoughts and the results thereof from some of the politicians and media type as I had always considered myself (in particular in my younger years) as much an American as a Canadian due to my background, upbringing, time spent south of the border and a brief spell living in Fla many years ago.  I suppose Rattletrap2 could consider himself lucky as they never told him to drop his pants and bend over as the guard slipped on a pair of latex gloves  jmho, hope that you don't take my thoughts personally B.Bob, and I wish I could get back to sleep after waking up at 3AM to have a pee!!!  See Wayne's link"
583999,singingdog,2011-05-17 09:48:00,1047,"Still sounds to me like border guards doing their job. Imagine that; you told them you were harmless and they didn't just enter that into the computer and wave you through with a smile every subsequent time that you showed up.   I'm sure that the folks that they are trying to catch never thought to try that same tactic; ""Hey, let's pretend that we are going down for 'training' then they won't hassle us at the border.""  I imagine this thread would have a very different tone if we were talking about the smuggler or terrorist that got through the border using exactly the same story that you are describing: letter from employer, story about frequent training in the states, harmless looking middle-aged guy with no visible ties to a criminal group. Folks would be ranting about how stupid the border guards were for falling for such a transparent ploy."
584005,Billy Bob,2011-05-17 10:40:00,5865," PikeHunter, nothing personal here...we are all discussing current events that effect all of us....  As you mentioned the OP had papers but you have to remember some of the terrorist also did....I thinking (not sure) they had papers to ""STUDY"" here in the USA...  NOTE: all the terrorist had passports....  I think I biggest problem now is we were (Americans/Canadians) so use to traveling back and forth all these years over the boarder in basic unrestricted way that we were spoiled. I remember just months before 9/11 I was traveling to Fort Erie Raceway in Ontario (30 minutes from home) and the couple we were traveling with had a NEXUS pass but could not use it because my wife and I were in the back seat.....I made the comment that maybe they should just have a open boarder.....since the free trade act went through and the basic questions of where were you born and where were you going were basically meaningless these days. BOY DID THAT CHANGE QUICK...  BTW....how do we really know if Rattletrap2 got the old prostate exam without a doctor present...."
584036,pikehunter,2011-05-17 12:46:00,1659," Many of us had the same thoughts at that time. Seemed like the border was going the way of the iron curtain.  Prostate exam  But not so funny when I go to the urologist next month...Going to be in trouble, he was expecting me to go for a biopsy last year. Gee wonder why I procrastinated about it?  Iv'e had it twce before...the last test they shot 11 needles into my prostate for samples. Afer the 6th KAZING  I was totally numb and that made the remaining 5 a humiliating memory.  Then urinating blood for 2 days after  please noooooooo......  Those who have only had a colonoscopy don't realize how easy that is until they go for a prostate biopsy.  How did I get onto this topic????"
584047,jjcanoe,2011-05-17 13:08:00,744,"My Father-in-law has the same problems more often than not when crossing.  he sells and services hi-tech computer and and mechanical control systems for the greenhouse industry. He designs and installs them acording to each indivdual site.  basically no two systems are the same and he is considered a specialist.  Anytime one of his systems malfunctions through wear or incompetance (someone who has not been properly trained to use the equipment decides to operate things) he needs to trouble shoot over the phone (camera phones are great for this) If the problem can't be remedied then it's off to Detroit Airport to hop the next plane to somewhere.  He knows all the crossing rules regarding his situation (probably better than many of the border guards he deals with) Before he leaves for the border he has all the proper documentaion for himself, any gear he has to take (diagnostic tools, fault code readers, electircal stuff etc.) plenty of paperwork also.  He's been turned back plenty of times for many reasons, all of which are 100% at the discression of the guard in the booth.  If he doesn't like the way you hand him your passport he can deny you entry, if he doesn't like your equipment he can deny you entry, if he doesn't like the colour of your shirt, he can deny you entry.  You can have everything in 100% perfect order and still be denied entry.  It's all based on their interpretation of the rules...  Just like driving, crossing into another country is a privledge not a right. It must be earned and can be taken away.  Myself, I've probably crossed thousands of times in the truck (I'm a truck driver) and probably close to 500 times in my personal vehicle (easy to do growing up in a border town and having a US girlfriend for 3 years LOL)  I've only ever been searched about 4 or 5 times, all on the Canadian side in my own vehicle and probably a dozen times in the truck (split equally between the Canadian and US sides)"
584209,Rattletrap2,2011-05-17 19:53:00,1652," Thanks Wayne. Interesting read!   ""BTW....how do we really know if Rattletrap2 got the old prostate exam without a doctor present.... ""  Bob, I'm actually in need of one of those exams, but to date, non of the Guards look my type! The only female I have dealt with looked like she had bigger hands than the men.They probably would withhold the findings anyways!  Singingdog, I am not pretending anything! I was up front and honest. I offered them anything I could and was prepared to comply with whatever they asked of me. I stayed calm and was always polite despite their rudeness.  I just don't understand the purpose of a valid passport? They have all the time in the world at our Immigration Authority to check us out and make sure we are who we say we are before they issue us one. How can the US disregard these documents and worse yet, our  Government pardons? Believe me, Canada is not the enemy here!"
584311,SlowPoke,2011-05-18 00:24:00,2984,"Rattletrap2, did you look into the DHS-TRIP link I posted?"
584366,NBR,2011-05-18 02:12:00,163,"All I can do is say I'm sorry for the way you were treated. Every organization has some jerks and sadly you ran into some. They can do there job and still be polite. Some people when pressed into a job with a little clout have there hats blown apart by an over inflated ego.   [irst let me state, that ever since I was a kid, I have been in awe of the US of A and fascinated by this country! Over my career, I have absolutely seen more of the United States than I have of Canada. That's quote name=Rattletrap2' date='16 May 2011 - 12:38 AM' timestamp='1305520694' post='583503] Okay, Just got in from another ordeal at the longest undefended border!  Fjust the way it is. My occupation required me to partake in technical training that was almost always somewhere in the US. I was fortunate enough to come here a lot.  Back at the end of March, I was given 2 days notice that I would be spending 10 weeks in Cleveland, Ohio. Now this ain't Palm Beach or anything, just another industrial city where a major manufacturer is located and has their training school.  I love my job and am thankful to have the opportunity to be here and learn something new that will make me more valuable at home. The part I wasn't thrilled about, was that I didn't have time to get my home in order for me to be away this long. I already feel like a dolt for not being home when there is so much work to be done around the house this time of year. Fortunately, I have a very supportive and understanding Wife that has always supported me when I had to travel over the last 31 years. She never complains, but I sure don't like leaving her with all the work.  The fun started on March 27th. Everyone says ""just tell em' you are visiting friends"". I say, no way! I am going there for legitimate reasons, I have nothing to hide, and I don't have so much as an outstanding parking ticket against me! Everything went relatively smoothly the first Sunday I crossed. I have a Passport like they want, and I had a letter to the company that I was going to. They let me through with only a few stupid questions! Don't get me wrong here, I am polite as can be and answer everything they ask. They didn't ask for any documentation or anything. I decided that I would make the 6 hour trip home every second week-end and even told the guard this.  A few weeks later, I am heading back on a Sunday evening and the Guard says"" No! I don't think you have any right to be coming down here for training. Why don't you get this at home? I explain that although the company has offices in Canada, that the training is only offered here. Well he does not like this and says I need a Visa to come down here. I said that i understood that I could not work in the US and that I was being paid by my employer at home. He tells me to hand him my keys and goes off to talk with someone else at another booth. He comes back and says again that I have no right to be doing what I'm doing and that I need to pull into the compound and go inside to speak with Immigration officers. They herd me like cattle into the building and interrogated me for 45 minutes to 1 hour! I again answered the same questions over and over, and listened to what they had to say. In the end, they said I needed to have a letter from my employer and the company that is offering the training. He tells me what the letter has to contain and sends me on my way. I then get yelled at by a female officer for not walking on the correct hatch marks back to my vehicle. No problem, just glad to be on my way! Oh, when they asked for any documentation, I told them I had it the first week, but did not have it with me. He says that every time i come here, I am knocking on the door and asking for permission to enter, and need to have it. I said okay and said I understood and would comply asap.  I went home for Mothers Day last week and when i get back to the border Sunday night. I run into one of the  guards that i had previously dealt with, but he had eventually let me go. He is all set to start into me about going in to speak with Immigration again, when i said that I was in there already and that a specific Immigration officer (I remembered his name) had told me to get these two letters and that was all I needed. He backs down and says Okay, go on through.  Tonight, ( I had to go back home again this week for a graduation function) the guard says he couldn't read my plate and asks me if I know the numbers. No problem Sir, and I tell him. The camera flashed on my front plate like always. There is nothing obstructing either of my plates. He asks me if I come to the States a lot, and of course i explain everything again, and tell him that in 3 weeks iI will be finished and that I will go home once more on Memorial Day week-end.(I get to miss our Victoria Day long week-end!) He again asks me what my citizenship is? I thought perhaps that my Canadian passport and Ontario tags were a dead giveaway, but answer politely.  I had already offered him my Passport and the two letters. He says great,, and takes them from me! He then tells me to put the vehicle in park, shut the engine off, step out of the vehicle and hand him the keys. The engine was already off, but I comply. A second guard escorts me inside after telling me to empty my pockets on the front seat. I asked for my wallet and he says you are not going anywhere near the vehicle again and to walk this way. He says the computer randomly selected me for a vehicle search. i am asked to sit in a room out of sight and they drove my car into a garage and searched it for about a 1/2 hour! He comes back inside and says that he saw my new PAL certificate in my wallet and is there any weapons in the car? I don't even own one yet! I politely tell him this and he gives me back my stuff and send me on my way!  Sorry for the long winded rant, but I am thoroughly PO'd about this and the lustre is really starting to wear off this fine country that I admired so much!!  I guess I was so naive that I thought they would be thankful I was coming down here to spend tens of thousands of dollars! After all this is done, I will have to come back to the US in August for two more weeks. I can hardly wait! I think I will just park my car, bend over and place my elbows on the hood, and let them all have a turn with me!  I can't imagine trying to bring a boat load of fishing gear across the border! Do our guards treat all of our Southern friends this way when you come up here in June? Is this normal procedure? It is a sad state of affairs if this is what things are coming to with our closest allies and neighbours.  I'm hoping someone on here has some inside knowledge of these matters and can shed some light for me! I'm an honest guy who plays by and follows the rules. What the heck do they do with criminals?  Thanks (Maybe when the 3 gallons of coffee I drank to get me here wears off,I can get to sleep!) LOL "
584377,Dara,2011-05-18 02:34:00,3052,US border guards are basically idiots and try to see who can be the worst each shift. There is a law against being a smart ass to US border guards and they try to make you break it.
584383,Rattletrap2,2011-05-18 02:55:00,1652," Slowpoke, Yes, and I am still reading the info on their site. I worry that once I make a complaint, will it affect my travel even more?  Thanks for the link!"
584432,SlowPoke,2011-05-18 11:21:00,2984," I wouldn't think so; an officer at Lewiston brought it to my attention and urged me to apply. I cross everyday and haven't been back to immigration since. The redress inquiry gives the experts time to look into your situation; ponder, debate, investigate and authorize a green light. A customs officer at a booth has about 30 seconds to decide and will ALWAYS err on the side of caution. With a redress number on your profile I would think the folks in the booth would have to be pretty darn suspicious to override and detain. It's a pre-screening process and it really does make their job easier; not unlike a nexxus or fast card, enhanced drivers licence etc."
583635,irishfield,2011-05-16 14:53:00,26272,"You've handled it well Brian! And for anyone else here that crosses regularily I'd follow Brian's example of tolerance. All it takes is pissing off one customs officer... and him typing in the computer DENIED ! Nobody, other than that specific officer can reverse that decission. He is prosecuter, judge and jury and if you ever want back into the USA again be prepared to spend 10's of thousands of dollars on lawyers. There are examples of many that have had to sell their vacation properties on either side of the border, as they can't get to them anymore!"
583639,Handlebarz,2011-05-16 15:03:00,3790,I can say that they will have you on file no matter what crossing you go to the plate is in there and they know the info when the plate is read.  They ask the same questions over and over to see if you slip up. They will also inspect you if you are heading over and staying for periods of time like you are it just looks fishy. They will also do random inspections when the computer said so and you might have been unlucky one time. From past visits if some one flagged your license plate then it will come up that way every time.  I cross with my company every week 3-5 times a week each way and they know every time. They will ask me when the last time I was Xrayed if I don't know they will send me in for a reminder. If I know I tell them and if it was in a different truck I let them know that as they already know its on the computer. I have a different card from NEXUS but same idea.  Sounds to me like some guard liked you and flagged you. just be polite every time and have your papers in order.  They also act stern and mad to through you off or make nervous people mess up.  Hope things get better for you.
583643,blaque,2011-05-16 15:12:00,2419,"I do remember now thinking back, as a child coming back with the family from a vacation up in canada being brought aside at customs and my father having his new 78 thunderbird searched thoroughly by US customs. And i mean thoroughly......seats taken out etc. From what i understand, it was because his vehicle matched the description of one they were on the lookout for. DOnt remember why it was. Didnt seem to matter that he had identification of who he was......a wife and 3 kids in the car etc."
583645,blaque,2011-05-16 15:19:00,2419,"Just had a canadian truck deliver minutes ago to our dock on the US side. First thing he said as i asked how his day was going was.......""Well, the bridge was a mess, but other than that im doin fine"" lol. I asked if it was a longer than normal wait and he said ""yeah, there scouring the trucks ever since they got bin laden"". He also mentioned that he's fine with the diligance at the border and understands the reasoning behind it."
583677,Garry2Rs,2011-05-16 16:35:00,1425,"I have hauled a boat both ways for the last five years. Occasionally they want to look inside, going down, not coming back, so far.  Frankly it's harder to get out of Yuma Az.  There is a check point on the highway about 50 miles into the desert.  They have dogs, at the check point, looking for illegal's.  On the morning I'm heading home I pack yesterdays laundry and my sleeping bag inside the boat...This always causes the dogs to act-up."
583685,Terry,2011-05-16 16:48:00,14456, you do need to apologize you had nothing to do with it  or did you....  it has happened to me and was even more of a hassle then you had..made the first couple of days in FLD lousy just thinking about how hard it was getting into the USA..I have not been back..so there...2 years later they were having financial troubles..that will teach them..LOL  I think it is the beard
583694,Dutchy,2011-05-16 17:11:00,416,"For everyones info, single male travelling alone is no 1 on their list. Race/ethnic background is ""largely"" irrelevant. This is because they are scared if they racially profile, terrorist groups will find people that don't fit the profile to do their deeds.  I know this because I used to get dragged in all the time as well. I had one immigration officer who was quite chatty (And he was reading Ontario outdoors) and I simply asked why I was being pulled in all the time. Answer: Single male travelling alone.  I'm sorry you had to go through it, I can totally relate, but if I moan about it, it won't change. Your approach works the best, suck it up and smile.  :whistling:"

583702,craigdritchie,2011-05-16 17:38:00,1586,I would venture a guess that single males traveling alone represent the vast majority of people crossing the border every single day.
583705,Dutchy,2011-05-16 17:57:00,416," I would guess so too, but that is what the guy told me. I am sure there are other red flags on top of that. I have heard the same info from other people at airport check in before when the TSA was first brought online in the early 2000's. I always got searched and that was why. I am sure the frequency with which you cross the border also plays in to it as well."
583709,Twocoda,2011-05-16 18:03:00,4130,"im with Terry on this one ...after many years of crossing issue free (normal crap) they decided to interrogate me and my plane flew away without me on it ...that was their first and last opportunity to do so....other countries welcome visitors with open arms and appreciate my visits...holidays are not supposed to be started off with Bull...who needs it ..  I was once comming back from down south and there was a dude ( he looked and sounded like Boomhower) that was comming to canada to train canadians on a factory machine because his company relocated to Toronto...the canadians denied him and this is why we no longer have two dollar bills  side note...Canada is filled with people with funny accents to make a canadian vacation feel foreign..  i guess in your situation the beard might be a ""flag"" but if you shave it off...whatever you do ....DONT wear an ""Orange County Chopper"" shirt"

583742,aplumma,2011-05-16 19:12:00,6896, The apology was that he has to be treated like a criminal because of the actions of a few. In a way I did have something to do with it I voted the government in (well some of them) and told them to make me feel safe and this is their attempt. I would rather apologize to 1000 people if it will stop one person from getting thru and causing act of terrorism. If I apologize to you too will you come see the good side of the USA?

Like a lot of you, I am thankful that they are doing their jobs.The Canadian Guards are very polite to me and maybe, just maybe, they should be checking things out in a little more detail?  The part that gets me is that they now have loads of info on me. I have complied with all their requests. They have had their fun. It is now time to move on to bigger fish!  They have looked at my wallet, passport, letters from the school, letters from my employer, been given reference numbers to contact, checked out my record if they desire, and found i am squeaky clean. I am born and raised in Canada, like my parents and grandparents before me. I do not have any flags (or should not have any!).  I too am doing my job. i would think that a few questions would suffice at this point to confirm I am the same individual.  The Nexus option is a good one, but unfortunately won't help me with this situation.  My beard has been the source of jokes for years. If I was to shave it off now, it would look like I am trying to hide! LOL I have had it for over 20 years!  Wayne, I know what you are saying all too well. All it takes is one wrong comment or remark and I am done! That would be a real tragedy!  I just had to vent last night and see if anyone had any inside info or similar experiences.  In regards to my frequent trips back and forth. This is why I was upfront and honest with them at the very first crossing. The letters explain in detail when and why I am going back and forth.

I said that i understood that I could not work in the US and that I was being paid by my employer at home. He tells me to hand him my keys and goes off to talk with someone else at another booth. He comes back and says again that I have no right to be doing what I'm doing and that I need to pull into the compound and go inside to speak with Immigration officers. They herd me like cattle into the building and interrogated me for 45 minutes to 1 hour! I again answered the same questions over and over, and listened to what they had to say. In the end, they said I needed to have a letter from my employer and the company that is offering the training. He tells me what the letter has to contain and sends me on my way. I then get yelled at by a female officer for not walking on the correct hatch marks back to my vehicle. No problem, just glad to be on my way! Oh, when they asked for any documentation, I told them I had it the first week, but did not have it with me. He says that every time i come here, I am knocking on the door and asking for permission to enter, and need to have it. I said okay and said I understood and would comply asap.  I went home for Mothers Day last week and when i get back to the border Sunday night. I run into one of the  guards that i had previously dealt with, but he had eventually let me go. He is all set to start into me about going in to speak with Immigration again, when i said that I was in there already and that a specific Immigration officer (I remembered his name) had told me to get these two letters and that was all I needed. He backs down and says Okay, go on through.  Tonight, ( I had to go back home again this week for a graduation function) the guard says he couldn't read my plate and asks me if I know the numbers. No problem Sir, and I tell him. The camera flashed on my front plate like always. There is nothing obstructing either of my plates. He asks me if I come to the States a lot, and of course i explain everything again, and tell him that in 3 weeks iI will be finished and that I will go home once more on Memorial Day week-end.(I get to miss our Victoria Day long week-end!) He again asks me what my citizenship is? I thought perhaps that my Canadian passport and Ontario tags were a dead giveaway, but answer politely.  I had already offered him my Passport and the two letters. He says great,, and takes them from me! He then tells me to put the vehicle in park, shut the engine off, step out of the vehicle and hand him the keys. The engine was already off, but I comply. A second guard escorts me inside after telling me to empty my pockets on the front seat. I asked for my wallet and he says you are not going anywhere near the vehicle again and to walk this way. He says the computer randomly selected me for a vehicle search. i am asked to sit in a room out of sight and they drove my car into a garage and searched it for about a 1/2 hour! He comes back inside and says that he saw my new PAL certificate in my wallet and is there any weapons in the car? I don't even own one yet! I politely tell him this and he gives me back my stuff and send me on my way!  Sorry for the long winded rant, but I am thoroughly PO'd about this and the lustre is really starting to wear off this fine country that I admired so much!!  I guess I was so naive that I thought they would be thankful I was coming down here to spend tens of thousands of dollars! After all this is done, I will have to come back to the US in August for two more weeks. I can hardly wait! I think I will just park my car, bend over and place my elbows on the hood, and let them all have a turn with me!  I can't imagine trying to bring a boat load of fishing gear across the border! Do our guards treat all of our Southern friends this way when you come up here in June? Is this normal procedure? It is a sad state of affairs if this is what things are coming to with our closest allies and neighbours.  I'm hoping someone on here has some inside knowledge of these matters and can shed some light for me! I'm an honest guy who plays by and follows the rules. What the heck do they do with criminals?  Thanks (Maybe when the 3 gallons of coffee I drank to get me here wears off,I can get to sleep!) LOL"
583508,Gerry,2011-05-16 06:55:00,257,Get yourself a NEXUS card and your problems will be over.
583514,singingdog,2011-05-16 09:38:00,1047,Sounds to me like border guards doing their job .
583516,spincast,2011-05-16 09:43:00,3279,"A Nexus card can make crossing easier for visits - but they may still ask why you are coming to the USA and if they do, going to school is something that (in some ciircumstances) requires Visas for foriegn students (Canada has this requirement too from some countries I believe). You may want to consider crossing at a different Port (but be aware Lewiston and Fort Erie are the same Port from a  management perspective). Your info (name, plate # etc)  is now likely registered in the computer at the current Port. You can speak to the Port director and try to get this reversed, but it can be a lengthy exercise, and depending on how busy they are you may have some difficulties. If your employer is a large US firm however, they will have some pull through their association, and can probably help in this matter.  You can drop me a PM if you want, I do have some contacts at various US Ports and have had dealings with many of the Ports through my work.  If you pursue the Nexus option they will also ask why you need a card / reasons for your visits. Not sure how things would pan out if you told them schooling - you may want to enquire in that before you fork out all the money for background checks and time for interviews."
583521,Billy Bob,2011-05-16 10:20:00,5865,Sorry about the boarder interrogations you have had to tolerate recently.  I believe that boarder security has been stepped up because of the Bin Dead character we finally killed in Pakistan...  You probably fit a profile that they are concerned with and that's just the way it's going to be for a while....Please don't blame us but rather the wacko's that are trying to destroy our country and yours because of how good we have it and how bad they have it.  Hopefully someday our boarders will revert back to the old days of just saying I'm Canadian or American and get that friendly smile with OK go ahead...but I don't think that's going to happen in our life time.

583527,bubbles,2011-05-16 11:34:00,591,"1 - I think they were doing their Job, the more you cross on a regular basis the more likely you are to be chosen for the random search, and the more suspisious you look. 2 - Do you think the guy running drugs across tells them so, nope, he is going for training too. 3 - there are ways to make things easier, Nexus, letters from employers etc.. and all this knowledge comes with experience, which you now have. 4 - This year will be out 11th crossing with a loaded boat,(knock on wood), a five minute chat about fishing and we are on our way.  I'm sure it's not what you wanted to hear but it's just my 2 1/2 cents.  OH and I almost forgot, did you try fishing the Detroit river since you were down this way?"
583528,blaque,2011-05-16 11:35:00,2419, Dont let a few employees at the entrance ruin your opinion of a country. Continue to mold your opinion based on your experiences once you get in

583532,aplumma,2011-05-16 11:38:00,6896,I am floored by this. I am sorry that that happened to not only you personally but anyone that wants to come to the USA. I understand the first time request for the papers but after that it would seem you are in the computer notes. I can only think that you may have tripped one of the profiles in our heightened state of security we are in. We have had troubles with people flying into a bordering country and crossing by land because our airport security is now really amped up and has a lot more resources to catch terrorists. It is a shame that they do not know you personally I am sure if they did they would pass you thru like you should be treated.  The answer to your question as far as how I am treated as I cross over into your country very well a few questions and a have a nice trip. It is in fact harder for me to get back into the USA than it is to leave it.....  So accept my apology with my explanation Brian.    Art
583533,Hud,2011-05-16 11:38:00,140,"as a person from the states living here, I feel your pain.  This happens to me about 30-40% of the time I come back into Canada.  I'm sure there is some ""randomness"" to it all but it doesn't feel like it.  Where did you cross?"
583546,Harrison,2011-05-16 12:16:00,2202,It's the beard.
583550,Mike01,2011-05-16 12:27:00,378,"I have traveled to the States on a regular basis for 15 years, mostly air travel though.  I often find that boarder guards are rude, plain and simple.  I know they are doing their job and I fully support that but they should at least require some person interaction skills."
583552,Canadave,2011-05-16 12:35:00,62,"From my experience, the secret to entering the U.S. without any hassle is to drive an old beige Buick LeSabre.  Have you ever noticed that only old harmless looking dudes drive a beige LeSabre.  Also when you talk to the guy at the booth always wear glasses and look over the top of them so you look even older.  Be sure to wear a dorky looking hat and a plaid shirt buttoned up at the top.  This way you look old, dorky and stupid and therefore non-threatening.  I think border guards are trained to understand that no self-respecting Taliban terrorist would ever drive an old beige LeSabre and dress like a dork. They always smell bad and look and act really really stupid but they never look over their glasses mainly because they can't afford glasses at least not until the Canadian government sends them huge cheques on a regular basis which takes at least two days from when they enter Canada claiming refugee status."
583557,Roy,2011-05-16 12:54:00,13728,HAHAHAHAHA Welcome back you ol' dork! Have you traded in the LeSabre yet?
583569,craigdritchie,2011-05-16 13:10:00,1586,"I travel to the States frequently on business, mostly by air, but also by car, and have never had an issue.  Only thing I can suggest is that either your name or your vehicle match to another person or vehicle that the US Customs guys have on a watch list. It's the only way to explain it.  One of my new co-workers had an issue at the Toronto airport last year when he arrived to travel on business and found himself on the no-fly list! It turns out some other guy with the same name, same age and same ethnic background is on Homeland Security's no-fly list, so my colleague had to spend two hours answering questions in a little room before they concluded he wasn't the dude they were looking for. Of course he missed his flight, which was a major pain, and he went through the exact same ordeal on the return trip. He has since got a NEXUS card and had no further problems."
583578,Rich Clemens,2011-05-16 13:20:00,3131,"  Yeah.  You'd think they would have all this info in the system so as to not put your through all of this ... time after time.  I cross the border several times a year. I have the same experience as Art shared, it takes longer for me to get back into the states than it does for me coming into Canada.  I only ever had one problem and that was getting turned around for having a bag of potates in the truck - for which I was specifically asked about.  I had to turn around, go back to customs in the states, turn over the potatoes, give a form signed, and come back through. Thank goodness, this was after midnight, so there was not much of a line.    Funny ... I used to take a sack of potatoes all the time and my Dad had just gone through the same border crossing not 24 hours before me ... and they never asked him about his potatoes.   Overall, I've never had any problems crossing the border ... must be our dogs they like."

583587,Canadave,2011-05-16 13:24:00,62,"Hi Roy ... Actually I traded in the old 98 LeSabre in Florida a few years ago for a 2005 Buick Century with only 4,800 miles on it.  Turns out it was owned by the Canadian TV sports announcer Don Chevrier who now lives on the brown side of the grass.  Now whenever I go to the U.S. I get a cavity search by some ape named Igor."
583590,pikehunter,2011-05-16 13:26:00,1659,The paranoia continues. Just think of all the cross border shoppers who endure this just for the privilege of spending their pretty colourful canadian cash over there.  Sorry to say but the Yanks have created a border nightmare. All because a couple of idiotic politicians and if I'm correct a particular CNN commentator were shooting their mouths off.  Hope your next trip to my Grandfather's native soil doesn't result in your detainment over this sort of stupidity.
583597,Joey,2011-05-16 13:39:00,9122,"Jeez Brian, that's not a fun way to spend your time.  I had an experience with the border once similar to yours.  It was not fun and wasted a whole bunch of everybody's time.  That was many, many years ago so had nothing to do with today's amped up security.  Sometimes the officer just wants to be a jerk (they can be one on both sides so no offence to our beautiful neighbours)."

583602,blaque,2011-05-16 13:48:00,2419,"Living on the US side......Ive never had a problem going into canada or coming back into the states.  Whether its with a fully packed vehicle and boat for a week long trek into quebec, or if its just going up to crystal beach for the day, or even back in the day going to toronto to hit the clubs for the night. GOing to the casino, even going up for work and bringing materials for store installations. Its been nothing more than a ""citizenship?, where ya headed? How long ya stayin? and go on through"". On the way back its a ""citizenship?, where ya been? bringin anything back? and go on through?""  Only time i had questions beyond that posed to me was when i was taking my niece and nephews from differnet parents up to a family gathering at crystal beach. I agreed to pick them up and take them with notes from each parent for the border patrol basicaly giving permission for me to take them across. I expected this might get hairy but it wasnt much more than a review of the written letters and asking each child what their relationship was with me and that they were in the vehicle voluntarily and on our way we went.  Ive been crossing the border at either the peace bridge, or rainbow bridge, also lewiston .....for many many years, ....and havent had an inkling of an issue.  Just my experience."
583630,Billy Bob,2011-05-16 14:37:00,5865," Sorry but I really think your WAY off base here....our country was attacked by foreigners on 9/11/01 with THOUSANDS of innocent people killed by terrorist and it's now our duty to protect our country and it's citizens to the fullest extent. So, it takes a bit longer to get in or out of the USA, but at least you or a love one is not blow up.  I can't make this any simpler to understand, even though it makes traveling over the bridges just a bit inconvenient for all of us going in both directions. I have had hold ups on the Canadian side as well as the American side of customs and know it's better to wait a few more minutes then have a re-acurrance of 9/11..  PLEASE remember we did not ask for this, but we will NEVER forget it."
