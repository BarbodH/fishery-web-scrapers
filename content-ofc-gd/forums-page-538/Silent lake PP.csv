I think the provincial park only rents out canoes, you cant use a motorized boat on Silent Lake, hence the name.  If you're looking to fish, i'd find a better lake..."

There are some monster bass in that lake, but a challenge to catch at times if you don't know the waters. Fish around weed and rock and you should do fine. Use tube jigs and senkos. There is a marina and a couple of resorts on the lake that you can check out for boat rentals."

If you camping to go fishing then you may want to search around, if your camping and are gonna go fishing then you should be ok."
584325,Lunatic,2011-05-18 00:49:00,536,"right on, thanks.  its more of a camping having fun deal with days spent on the lake fishing,hopefully i can pull up a few bass.i havent caught or fished for small mouth in a few years,been mostly LM and pike,with a few walleye here n there."
