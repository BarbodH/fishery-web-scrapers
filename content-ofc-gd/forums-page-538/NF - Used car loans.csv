584336,scugpg,2011-05-18 01:17:00,1373,"I'm considering getting a used vehicle and have been shopping around for loans with good interest rates. Best I've seen is around 5.6% fixed.  Is there banks or other financial firms that might offer a better rate?  Interest cost of borrowing sucks, so trying to find the best rate out there. No credit issues etc so figured I could find something better than what I've seen so far.  Thanks!"
584339,asdve23rveavwa,2011-05-18 01:23:00,2690,"One piece of advice I can give is know your credit report/score.  Better score=better rates, usually."
584342,kickingfrog,2011-05-18 01:23:00,8333,"If you are buying from a dealer they may have better rates. Read the fine print though, the lowest rates offered are usually for 2 or 3 year term."
584343,SRT8 smoker craft,2011-05-18 01:25:00,1107,Pay cash    That's prime right now gonna be hard to find a better rate unless you buy new with a 0% incentive .
584344,scugpg,2011-05-18 01:26:00,1373, The 5.6 is what I was told based on 5yrs. I'll see what is offered on shorter terms but the payment starts getting pretty big at that point
584345,scugpg,2011-05-18 01:27:00,1373, LOL yes wouldn't that be easier! Prime is 3% right now I believe.
584349,SRT8 smoker craft,2011-05-18 01:35:00,1107,just looked BOC rate is 5.69 on a 5 year morgage vehicles are usually a bit higher so your not doing to bad at 5.6%
584352,DRIFTER_016,2011-05-18 01:44:00,10439,  This is true. My current vehicle I bought used from a Honda dealer when they had one of their financing deals on. The rate was 0.9% on new vehicles and 3.9% on used.  FYI 5.6% is a pretty decent rate on a used vehicle. You will be hard pressed to get better than about 8% through a bank.
584356,BillM,2011-05-18 01:51:00,17367,"Get a line of credit and pay for the vehicle that way.  If you have a house, then make it a secure line of credit which will have an even lower interest rate."
584357,rob v,2011-05-18 01:53:00,535,"If you're getting quoted that rate from the dealer make sure you find out what if any discount on the purchase price you can get if you pay cash - then arrange a personal loan or personal line of credit with your lender/banker. 5.6% for 5years does look like a pretty good rate though. If you've got some equity in your home, home owner credit lines are usually the cheapest way to borrow.  what you're basically doing is arranging a secured (mortgage on your home) line of credit - in return for a good rate.  takes a little bit of time at the outset to get set up - but then you've got it for as long as you own your home."
584361,scugpg,2011-05-18 02:01:00,1373, I have heard folk do this as well. I'll check that out last time I asked it was a 500 setup fee. I've  of heard some folks getting a 2% variable which is great.
584368,SlowPoke,2011-05-18 02:18:00,2984,"Yup. Some banks have different names for it but it's essentially an equity line of credit. Had I not just bought the house, I could have paid for my new truck within my equity LOC and would have a 2.25% interest rate. Instead, I used a portion of it and put the rest on an unsecured (normal) line of credit which will yield a combined rate near 3.5%. Still damn good compared to the 12% dealer financing!  An equity line works like this... 200,000 property value 160,000 eligible equity (80% of value) -130,000 balance owing ======== 30,000 available credit  Depending on the amount borrowed, the $500 registration fee (reappraisal etc.) can be realized easily in interest savings. Having said all that; if your mortgage term is nearing renewal (within 6-7months), you have a little leverage and they may waive the $500 fee to keep you at bank x."
584370,BillM,2011-05-18 02:20:00,17367,This is how I paid for my truck.  They also waived the setup fee as I just signed with them for my house.  No dealer can get you a rate like that.
584446,kemper,2011-05-18 12:22:00,2232,"  I pay 5% on my LOC, but I am a student (read: unsecured). Line of credit is probably the way to go."
584602,torco,2011-05-18 20:35:00,656,Definitely agree with Bill if you have equity your best rate is likely going to be a secured line of credit.  That said 5.6% is not a terrible rate for a used vehicle.
584615,scugpg,2011-05-18 21:06:00,1373,Thanks guys going to look at those options. I appreciate all the responses!
584616,ohhenrygsr,2011-05-18 21:13:00,947,Make sure to ask them where the financing is coming from.  Try to use banks not 3rd party lenders
584625,bigbuck,2011-05-18 21:36:00,2449,I'd jump on 5.6%. You probably will not find a better rate than that.
