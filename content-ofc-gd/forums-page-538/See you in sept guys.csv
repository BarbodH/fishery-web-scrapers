583944,Ron,2011-05-17 01:56:00,1683,"Hey,  Was Solo paddler there? Seems like he's got the look....  "
583947,solopaddler,2011-05-17 02:00:00,8605,"    C'mon man my pike are waaay bigger than that!   Ah to be young again. Have a great summer up there, I'm very envious."
583949,irishfield,2011-05-17 02:10:00,26272,I think Ron was suggesting the facial features of the lad more than the pike.....

584026,lookinforwalleye,2011-05-17 12:18:00,4399,"Nice place, but at a whopping 1000 bucks a nite for two I`ll have to win a lottery to afford that!"
584052,pics,2011-05-17 13:15:00,1268,"  While it looks like a great place, the price of almost $600 for the flight and $495pp per night is a little beyond my budget... for that price you could go to BC for salmon..."
