583722,Lostchild,2011-05-16 18:36:00,153,"You don't access the reel thru the drag system to pull the body apart. Undo the handle, then undo the three little screws on the one side of the reel. Pull the cover off and all your gears will be there, becareful not to lose any little washers/parts."
583751,jimmer,2011-05-16 19:30:00,2730,"I hear you, but there is only two screws on the side and you do have to take the drag off to get this one apart. I have a few shimanos and this is the only one like this. I have no idea why they designed this one like that. All the others have 3 screws and even a screw on the end of the drag for removal if required. I just talked to a buddy who repaired shimano reels and he says there is a special tool to remove the drag, but also said I shouldn't have to grease the thing. I guess I'll just keep using it until it unbearable. Thanks for replying though."
