223869,Greencoachdog,2008-07-06 17:09:00,8163,I inflate all my tires to max pressure. I feel the vehicle handles better and the tires wear/last longer.
223910,forrest,2008-07-06 20:25:00,1032,"Well, the tire will read 2 different cold pressures: one with boat on the other with boat off.  Higher pressure means less tire wear but less grip on the road. Less pressure means more tire wear and it will be harder to tow.  I am pretty sure that you don't need the extra grip for cornering (unless you drive extra fast with the boat on or on dirt roads a lot.  forrest"
223911,Billy Bob,2008-07-06 20:26:00,5865,"Trailer tires should be inflated to MAX no matter what the load is, that way you will not forget to add PSI when you do have a full load. But remember to check the tire pressure in the morning before driving on them. Most blow outs occur because of under inflated tires.  Bob"
223951,Rich Clemens,2008-07-06 22:11:00,3131,"I fill my trailer tires to the max specified.  Also, be sure to check your spare ... ya just never know."
223985,Bernie,2008-07-06 23:59:00,3190,Fully inflated tires run cooler. The reason is because of less flexing of the sidewalls. Always run them at max pressure. As stated previously check them cold.
223993,Fisherman,2008-07-07 00:11:00,7201,"I double dare you to find a difference in tire pressure with the boat on or off the trailer. I mounted my car tires on the rim, inflated them to 32 psi, then put the new tires/rims on the car and guess what, yup, still 32 psi."
