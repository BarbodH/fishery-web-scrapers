223341,jwl,2008-07-04 20:50:00,1056,"that's cuz American beer doesn't have any alcohol in it   reminds me of many years ago, I worked as a kitchen supervisor/sous chef at a Yuk- Yuks night club, and at the time there was no such thing as all the different beers with 6-7 % alcohol in them, I think there was only one brand at the time and it was Molson Brador or somehting, and it had 6% alcohol which atthe time was the strogest beer you could buy. Being in Niagara Falls at the time and a border town alot of American tourists would come over and some of the comedians there would poke little jokes at them about being able to have 3 beers and getting hammed  On a side note though, when me and some of my party friends where teenagers, if we got someones older brother or something to go over the border and get booze we had a few good days of drinking 151 proof rum which you couldn't buy here and still can't...and also the 90 proof JD as opposed to our 80 proof.  But I still say we Canajun's can out drink ya's in beer no prob"
