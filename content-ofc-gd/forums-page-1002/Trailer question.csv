Yesterday after arriving home from the lake, I noticed that the coupler on the trailer was pivoted at a 30 degree angle.  I was unable to unlock the coupler from the hitch ball, it was clamped on.  After reviewing the situation, I removed the nut on the hitch ball and raised the trailer up.  Once the boat was released from the truck, I was able to manually rotate the coupler back to its normal position and was able to raise the coupler lock to release the ball.  The brake fluid seemed a little low so I filled it up to the fill line.  Could there be a problem with the acuator?  Thanks, Tom"
