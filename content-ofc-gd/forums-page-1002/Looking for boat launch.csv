Theres another at Ferris Provincial Park which is below the lock. and a third further south of C'ford just off percy boom rd, this one is also below the lock."

If you launch there go upstream to the island and fish the right side where the weeds grow next to deep water. I've caught smallies, walleyes, carp and a musky there."
