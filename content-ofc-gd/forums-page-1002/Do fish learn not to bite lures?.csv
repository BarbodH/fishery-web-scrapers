223538,jace,2008-07-05 08:56:00,472,"  sounds like an urban legend to me.  Without any muscles for swimming or fins for control, the fish would not be able to get to the lure.  I heard a similar story about pike when i was younger and I did the same to see if it would move in the water.  My friend and i were so disappointed when it sunk to the bottom like any other fish carcass.   I don't doubt the fish still has some functions left if is cleaned quickly, sorta like that guy on youtube with his leg shredded by a shark in 2' of water.  Okay, it's nothing like that guy's leg..."
223572,Tinman,2008-07-05 14:42:00,376,I think i saw that class offered in Algonquin's course calender
223672,Greencoachdog,2008-07-05 23:06:00,8163," I can't believe that one Dan!  If his knife never penetrated the rib cage, that would leave the swim bladder intact with no flesh for balast and no muscles to swim with... I'm pretty sure the remains would've floated and not sunk to the bottom.  ... and that someone that started fishing is a SNAGGER!!!   ... don't try to B.B. us Bubba."
223685,danc,2008-07-05 23:39:00,4677, LOL... What can I say Glen. I read that story in North American Fisherman when I was a member some time ago. Take it for what it's worth.
223688,Greencoachdog,2008-07-05 23:45:00,8163, I can't even take that one with a grain of salt Dan.
223693,misfish,2008-07-05 23:57:00,29133,"This is so true. Buddy broke off,I casted and wham,the same smallie,with a tube in it,s mouth. Fish are stupid,just like us that buy every friggn lure that is out there,LOL."
223340,JohnF,2008-07-04 20:46:00,3494," If a Great White or a few other flavours of shark came snooping around, I'd be outa the water pdq. Fortunately, we don't see them regularly where I've done most of my diving.  Diving is a great way to see the fish in their natural environment unstressed by a fisherman stalking them or tempting them with flashy fishy delicacies. I think it helps to imagine what's going on down below the boat when you're in the boat targeting the little guys. In a sense you learn to almost think like a fish - at least a pretty stupid fish.  As for the panic attacks, that's kinda s.o.p. for most new divers. I think we all have them to some degree at first. I can still remember when the realization hit me that I was swimming along the bottom of Georgian Bay all by myself about 80' from the surface. I became very determined to find my buddy. A bigger one was when it sunk in, very suddenly, that I was about 1,000' back in a limestone cave under the Yucatan jungle with about 20' of rock between me and air if I could go the short way. The long way was to swim back those 1,000' to open water. It's very very very black in those caves. That was a moment I remember clearly. It was one of those ""give yer head a serious shake"" times. After that it was all good. There's nothing wrong with a diver having a healthy respect for the situation. Only a fool doesn't do that. The trick is to not let the panic take control.  Try diving if you ever get the chance. It's a lot of fun.  JF"
223399,Greencoachdog,2008-07-04 22:36:00,8163,They don't get big and fat by being stupid!
223440,fishboy,2008-07-05 00:15:00,550, I caught the same smallie (MNR tagged) Saturday and Monday of the opening weekend using the same bait and within 20 yards of the same spot.
223473,MoriaRiverMan,2008-07-05 01:28:00,314,Ill go out on a limb on my own and say no......  I dont think they have jugdement skills.......  I cant believe a fish will sit there and make a decision whether a bait is real or not based on a passed experience .......  I dont see people buying fish and teaching them tricks........       Shows me they dont hold learning abilities.......  I think they work on a instinct bases.   Very simple creature that works on needs based funtions.  Probally wrong.......   but worth the post
223488,Greencoachdog,2008-07-05 02:25:00,8163, You don't think these fish have learned that there is food here and how to take it? 
223489,danc,2008-07-05 02:26:00,4677,"Fish are instinctive creatures. As far as I know they don't process any thoughts. If it looks like food, and they're hungry, they'll hit it. They don't have the option of opening the fridge and having a look around when they're hungry. They take what they can get. I don't believe that they get conditioned to certain lures."
223490,Greencoachdog,2008-07-05 02:30:00,8163,"  That's because you don't live where the fishing pressure is heavy enough Dan, how many other boats do you see out on the water on an average day?"
223497,danc,2008-07-05 02:52:00,4677," That's a good point Glen. I see very few, if any other boats on the waters that I fish. But apparently we're talking about intelligence here. Are fish intelligent? I'm not sure. Are humans? Supposedly they (we) are.  Yet few of us  think nothing of eating fatty foods, smoking cigarettes, drinking alcohol etc. Some do, but you and I don't.   Temptation is a dangerous thing. Doesn't matter how smart you are. If you want it bad enough, you'll go and get it. Even if you happen to be a fish."
223503,JohnF,2008-07-05 03:25:00,3494," Then why do we try to ""match the hatch""?  JF"
223509,danc,2008-07-05 03:41:00,4677, I use jigs for Brook Trout and Rapala Countdowns for practically everything else. No hatch matching for me. Sometimes simpler is better.
223510,timmeh,2008-07-05 03:43:00,609,"Personally i do not believe they become conditioned to certain lures. The reason you match the hatch is that they instinctively search out certain foods, and if you can match that your odds are better. Fish instinctively know what food looks like and behaves like. So for example if you use a tube to imitate a crayfish but present it wrong (in a way a crayfish would not act) that fish will instinctively know that somethings not right. But if the next person presents the bait in a more natural way that fish will hit.  I suspect the reason that fish appear more finicky on pressured lakes are due to a combination of factors. 1. there may be fewer fish in high pressure lakes, so of course you'll get fewer fish there. 2. heavy fishing pressure also creates negative stimuli that makes fish wary, like high boat traffic. So no matter what lure you use if boats and jetskis are tearing up the water fishing will be tough. As mentioned before when a trout senses your presence, it's very tough to catch. In high pressure areas fish certainly sense something unnatural is occuring It may not be your lure that looks unnatural to them, it may simply be your presence or that of the other hundred boats on the lake.  I've caught fish with hooks in their mouths, i've had fish that have got off only to turn around and re-hit the lure a second time. If they don't remember that quickly I would think it's unlikely they remember over being caught over time. Like Dan said fish can't really select what they want to eat, they make instant decisions.

223523,danc,2008-07-05 04:20:00,4677,"I read an article in a fishing mag a few years back about a guy that had caught a limit of Walleye. He kept them in his live well until he reached the dock. The guy was very proficient in cleaning fish and could do so without penetrating the rib cage. So he proceeded to clean his live fish and threw the carcasses back into the lake. Not long after, someone came down to the dock and started to fish. Soon after he had a fish on the line. What he had caught was one of the still alive filleted fish with no flesh attached to it. Tell me that fish had a memory and didn't bite out of instinct???"
223532,jimvanm,2008-07-05 06:27:00,27," Well, that fish had obviously lost a lot of weight and was probably just trying to build back the lost muscle mass ;-)  That is a whole new method of fishing. We should call that catch-fillet-and-release."
