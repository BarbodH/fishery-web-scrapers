223760,Handlebarz,2008-07-06 11:02:00,3790,we to would be heading out right now but we have the Kids fishing clinic here in Belle river so another day on shore it should be a great day as the temps will be nice for everyone. Good luck chasing slime but then again you should already have 2 hours in by now.
