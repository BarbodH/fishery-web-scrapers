223825,Greencoachdog,2008-07-06 14:56:00,8163,I'm not a big fan of noodling/grabbling Steve. They're taking the big breaders from our waters!  Tourney rules state hook and line caught only!  Would like to see a noodlers facial expression when he comes up with a large Snappin' turtle or Cottonmouth latched onto his hand!!!
223826,TroutnMuskieHunter,2008-07-06 15:00:00,1362,  ....you wouldn't even catch me close to that mud pit  ....man does that look dirty and I HATE SNAKES!!!!!
223828,oxcowboy,2008-07-06 15:05:00,544,"lots a fellas do it here in southern ohio too,  but i agree with dawg on this.  it ticks me off to see all those big ol gals pulled out of the system.  the big ones dont taste as good anyway.  plus i kinda like my fingers the way they are and not snacks for the snapping turtles.  jason"
