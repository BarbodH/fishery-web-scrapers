223599,bassjnkie,2008-07-05 16:30:00,1101,"""HI, MY NAME IS DANIEL, AND I AM HIGHLY ADDICTED"" Went shopping yesterday and spent my life savings, LOL. I went to LeBaron, bought a 6 of new SRO frogs, tube weight-rattles, some palstics, jigs and so on.... I then went to Fishing Depot (I personally love this store) and bought a bunch of buzzbaits, spinner baits, and my new born, a Daiwa 153HSTLA super tuned, swept handle and all.  I recomend this baitcaster to anyone."
223614,NANUK,2008-07-05 17:48:00,797,"That TD Advantage is a sweet reel, good choice."
223616,Beans,2008-07-05 19:18:00,3339,BUT...will it withstand the run of an angry 30 lb CARP ???
223618,Joeytier,2008-07-05 19:41:00,3990,"I own a high end Daiwa baitcaster, and it is a very nice reel.  I've always been impressed with their stuff."
223633,Greencoachdog,2008-07-05 21:15:00,8163, I believe Beans has got Carp-itis!!!
223664,bassjnkie,2008-07-05 22:52:00,1101,"No way, the drag isn't strong enough. A 30lb will tear it to shreads. It is a sweet reel though, I have 6 Daiwas and this one out performs them all. I like the Daiwa reels so much, I bought 3 carp reels, from the UK.  Anyways, I recommend the Advantage,  Daniel"
223669,kentooley,2008-07-05 23:02:00,208,Get a hold of yourself Daniel!!!!  It's OK!!  You'll be allright.(stroke- stroke)  :lol:  Enjoy!!
223674,BillM,2008-07-05 23:09:00,17367,A 30lb carp won't destroy anything if the drag is set properly..
223694,Greencoachdog,2008-07-05 23:58:00,8163, ... and you have enough line!
223695,Beans,2008-07-06 00:20:00,3339, You're right Dawg...it happens right after my alarm goes off on my bank stick and I feel the rush of of my first carp of the season...
223748,jace,2008-07-06 04:39:00,472,"I've had some TDA's and various TDA based reels and i think the lockdown on them is 9# or 10#, like for most reels around that size.   Since you generally set the drag to about 1/3 the breaking strength of the line, it should be okay for that carp.  If i remember right, the TDA  uses a nice 7 disc drag stack making it one of the smoothest around."
223758,danbo,2008-07-06 10:20:00,2646,"Those Carp fight like a wet towel ! I've landed 24 pounders on 6# mono down at Lakeview. I think Sheephead are more fun with ""headshakes"" & all! YMMV.. By the way, great reel choice."
