223570,Billy - Curtiss,2008-07-05 14:31:00,241,Is anybody clear on the regulations as per fishing here? Is it strictly a no live bait / single barbless hook zone? Or will I be fine tossing Panther Martins around?
223574,kickingfrog,2008-07-05 14:50:00,8333,"The regs are a bite of a pain for that area, and I don't want to mislead you.  On most of my spinners (big and small) I've switched the trebles for single hooks. It helps to keep me legal in different areas, doesn't get snagged as much, gets better hook sets and it's easier to un-hook fish."
