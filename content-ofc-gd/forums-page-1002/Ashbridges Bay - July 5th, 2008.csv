223717,vanillagorilla,2008-07-06 02:09:00,46,Great day on the water!  We went 8 for 10 with the wire dipsey being super hot.  We also caught some fish off the downriggers.  The dipsey rods were 40 and 50 feet down with one rod rigged with a spoon and the other with flasher & meat    Our Cannon probe told us where to set the lines.  We had surface temperatures of 54 and 42 down 50 feet.  We started fishing at 7:00am and this was our first hook up.  A 23 pound pig.    The following fish was caught in the middle of nowhere (3 miles between 2 hot-spot waypoints).  This fish believe it or not peeled off 660 feet of line before we were able to turn its head.  WOW!!!!!!!!!    We even caught a fish on a 4.0 Apex lure.  Most fish were caught at speeds between 2.2 and 2.5 mph at the ball which was usually a 3.0 speed at the surface (for those of you who do not have a Speed & Temp monitor)  Get out there the fish are on BIG TIME!!!!!!!
