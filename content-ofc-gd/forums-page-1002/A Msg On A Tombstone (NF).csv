223139,splashhopper,2008-07-04 14:29:00,2931,I love this one too>>  The Dash:  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPyu4M2di8U
223151,Joey,2008-07-04 14:43:00,9122,"Actually, that's a very uplifting message, for a tombstone.  Thanks for sharing that.  Joey"
223159,douG,2008-07-04 14:52:00,2693,"Thanks for sharing that one, Twilight.  I agree, I found it moving too.  Here is another one, in a different vein, ""I told you I was sick""."
223216,maybe,2008-07-04 16:47:00,307,Very neat pic...I love how the reflection on the outer border seem to fit in with the trees behind the stone.  Have you seen the puzzle tombstone?
223430,smbhunter,2008-07-04 23:48:00,186,That's a neat message.
223485,MoriaRiverMan,2008-07-05 02:09:00,314,I have a graveyard across from my house.......  Very interesting place i must say....  Even one tomb stone that says ..........Murdered by such and such....  It hold its place in history for that saying........  Maybe one day when i feel like taking a walk ill snap a picture........  I really find graveyard walks depressing.........sorry just does that to me........  fishing is so much more uplifting
223501,Cudz,2008-07-05 03:13:00,2652,Good observation.  It looks like the border is opaque.  crazy
223512,Tarzan's Jane,2008-07-05 03:48:00,1183,"The Dash is nice Splashhopper...had seen that one before.  Hadn't noticed the reflection Tangledlines, good eye...and the Puzzle Tombstone is quite different.  A walk in a cemetery can be a bit of a downer...but then again I felt a lot of love reading simple messages left for loved ones."
223522,FinS,2008-07-05 04:11:00,463,very neat
223528,Tinman,2008-07-05 05:19:00,376,"that is such a great message, it was used when my uncle passed away, my grandfather has the following on his, a retired firefighter, one of many in our family  When I am called to duty, God Where ever flames may rage, Give me the strength to save some life Whatever be its age. Help me embrace a little child Before it is to late Or save an older person from The horror of that fate. Enable me to be alert and hear the weakest shout And quickly and efficiently To put the fire out I want to fill my calling and To give the best in me, To guard my every neighbor and Protect his property. And if according to my fate I am to lose my life Please bless with your protecting hand My children and my wife."
