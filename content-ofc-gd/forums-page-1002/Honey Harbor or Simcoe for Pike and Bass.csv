Anyone familiar with both?  Would love to hear your comments on both or either one.  I am familiar with Simcoe but am concerned that the carp die off has affected the pike and bass.  Am I wrong?  Also, if anyone fishes both, which would you choose if you were in my shoes?  Any advice on fishing Georgian bay, honey harbor area would be greatly appreciated.  Any feedback on current action on either body of water and presentation would also be very much appreciated.  As the name dictates this is a rare occurance by me so I want to make it count.  Thanks in advance."
222943,love2fishhave2work,2008-07-04 02:28:00,212,I am surprised no one has any advice for this question.
222945,BillM,2008-07-04 02:34:00,17367,"GBay is good, but you really need to know where you are going.  I would bet you'd have better luck on Simcoe."
223005,bucktail,2008-07-04 11:23:00,1857,Have to agree with Bill on this one.
223212,Guest gbfisher,2008-07-04 16:42:00,0,just read the day you were going...Yer there!...... what ever descision you made anyway.....have fun
223493,love2fishhave2work,2008-07-05 02:32:00,212,Very happy with my choice today.  Perfect day on the water and caught plenty of bass (small and large) as well as several nice pike and an unexpected large Gar Pike.  First one ever for me.   Homework prior to fishing makes the day on the water much more enjoyable.
223500,Cudz,2008-07-05 03:09:00,2652,Gar pike.  you must have hit Gbay  actually not 100% sure.  I have seen gar in simcoe as well but not nearly as many as in Gbay
