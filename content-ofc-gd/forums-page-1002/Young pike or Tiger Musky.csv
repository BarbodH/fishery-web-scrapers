223584,Zubris21,2008-07-05 15:16:00,563,"Hey guys....  I was taking a look at some friends photos and came across this picture...  My initial thought was that it was a pike due to the dark greenish colour, then I started to look at the markings and they look pretty banded, especially at the tail, and I started to wonder if it might be a young tiger musky, altough it does seem like a few spots were developing.  I'm not sure how the colouring of young pike develops, but the banding on this fish almost make it look like a young Tiger musky.   As I've never fished for musky the only way I know how to identify them is by their markings/colour/size.  Two questions are there any other ways to distinguish a pike from a musky ie. fin location/shape or anything else, and second which species is this?  "
223592,Sandbag,2008-07-05 15:40:00,533,I would say Pike   Cheers  Craig
223593,bucktail,2008-07-05 15:44:00,1857,Pike!
223594,highdrifter,2008-07-05 15:45:00,2534,"esox lucius.  or.. northern pike.  Also acceptable are snot rocket, dink, and wee pike.  HD"
223595,Tdel,2008-07-05 15:48:00,393,"The musky is light-colored with dark vertical bars,  no scales on the lower part of its gill plate, and has 6 or more sensory pores on each side of its lower jaw. Muskies also have pointed caudal, pelvic, and pectoral fins.  The northern pike is dark-colored with light spots, has scales on the lower part of its gill plate, and has 6 or less pores on each side of its lower jaw.  Pikes also have rounded caudal, pelvic, and pectoral fins.  The tiger musky has irregular light vertical markings on a dark background, 5-7 pores on each side of its lower jaw, and scales on the lower part of the gill plate.  The picture that you have posted makes me think it is a pike also.  Tom"

223605,Greencoachdog,2008-07-05 17:00:00,8163,"I say Pike too, but I really like the pattern thing it has going there!!!"
223619,Zubris21,2008-07-05 19:42:00,563,"Thanks guys, I was thinking it was a pike, but I just wanted to make sure....  The pattern just looked a lot more organized than most pike I've seen."
223624,jediangler,2008-07-05 20:10:00,1923,That's a hammer handle pike. When they are little their markings are a bit strange.
223629,Burning Babies,2008-07-05 20:41:00,150,"Man, you guys do a lot better than the guys on the big Ohio fishing message board.  People would be calling that everything from a grass pickerel to a barracuda over there."
223631,Greencoachdog,2008-07-05 21:13:00,8163, What do you expect from a Buckeye?
