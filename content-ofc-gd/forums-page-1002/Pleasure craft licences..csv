224224,carp-starter,2008-07-07 09:44:00,253,"Roy, your icon ""THIS"" pointed to item #18 - the $250.00 fine - I think. If this is the case, Not all boats require a licence.  I have a 10 foot Zodiac with a 5 hp motor. As far as I knew, I did not required a ""licence"" and as a result, I did not have to put any numbers on the Zodiac. I was at Service Canada last week because of something else and the lady there informed me that all boats require a licence. I think that this is not the case. For this, read point #3 on the above list everyone. It states -  ""What types of boats need to be licensed?  A licence is mandatory for all pleasure craft equipped with a motor of 10 horsepower (7.5 kilowatts) or more, including personal watercraft.  Pleasure craft of all tonnages and lengths may be licensed as per the Canada Shipping Act. Alternatively, pleasure craft owners may choose to register their vessels in the Canadian Register of Vessels.""  But I will check with Service Canada again.  carp-starter"
