223048,danbo,2008-07-04 12:39:00,2646,Junkyard vs Forrest Griffin..brutal for sure! I'll take the Dog.  http://www.ufc.com/
223053,John,2008-07-04 12:46:00,2956,Not sure what you guy's see in two grown men beating the snot out of each other. I used to date a girl who could make either of those two cry in 30 secs!......
223075,goodtimer,2008-07-04 12:56:00,53, kiiiiiinda doubt that.  i'll take forest
223078,John,2008-07-04 12:59:00,2956, That's what I thought........never underestimate a woman when you are not paying attention.......
223120,Reef Runner,2008-07-04 14:08:00,981,"I don;t think the dawg had been tested much since he won the belt last year.  he kinda looked out of competitive shape during the ""ultimate fighter"" series.  I say its gonna be a full 5round stand up slugfest, with forrest winning in a split.  it's his time man."
223125,MoriaRiverMan,2008-07-04 14:11:00,314,I betting the dawg........    He hasnt proved himself much though but griffen seems to drop easy at times and other times he has a chin of steel  Like to see griffen win though..........He's great for the sport
223136,Bitsmith2k,2008-07-04 14:26:00,396, anyones chin looks like steel when its being hit with wet noodles...
223140,MoriaRiverMan,2008-07-04 14:29:00,314,Yeah man thats what i mean............  He puts on great brawl fights.........  but when a slugger taps him he hits the mat.  I think the dawg has a good snap behind his punch.
223157,danbo,2008-07-04 14:48:00,2646,"Personally, I like Forrest & he's definately Prime now..but Quinton is more of a killer..like Tyson was. Probably manic-depressive but..it works for me!"
223167,Bitsmith2k,2008-07-04 15:04:00,396,i like forrest too.. and after that shogun fight (regardless of shoguns condition pre & post fight) i wont ever bet against forrest..  i think rampage brings too much to the table for him though.. though forrest has an edge in that he's in the best camp around..
223168,richyb,2008-07-04 15:06:00,774,"Ill take forest by submission .,....  Rampage is a machine but i have a feeling about forest on this one !"
223199,Patow,2008-07-04 15:59:00,4,"Forrest by RNC.....  Rampage has been filming a movie + TUF, not in 5-rd fight shape. Forrest will wear him down and submit him.  You heard it here first......  Patow"
223211,danbo,2008-07-04 16:41:00,2646,Well it's 50/50...   I'm glad I'm not the one spitting my teeth at the end of it.
223255,gone_fishin,2008-07-04 17:44:00,481,"My heart is with Forrest, but my brain and my money is with Jackson!"
223310,steverowbotham,2008-07-04 19:57:00,1800, Ummm... Dan Henderson ?
223314,jwl,2008-07-04 20:07:00,1056,will see tommorrow night when I hit a local bar with the wife to go check it out.  My first thought ever since I heard of this match up is that Rampage will crumble Griffin..he walked all over Lidell a couple times and I don;t think that would be a good match up for Griffin either so I say...He mo whup Griffin's mule
223323,misfish,2008-07-04 20:12:00,29133,"I got to take Jackson on this one. Then again I thought Lesner would win too.LOL The real fight I cant wait to see, is the one with Spider and sandman on the 19th. Thats going to be a great fight. Hermes Franca Vs. Frank Edgar  will be another one to watch."
223330,glirw,2008-07-04 20:24:00,200,"I can't believe so many people are picking Forrest for this one. There is no place where Forrest is better than Jackson. On the feet Quinton has knockout power, while Griffin couldn't even rock Tito Ortiz. On the ground, Griffin can play a great defense game off his back, but Quinton will be too much for him. I predict a repeat of Jardine vs. Griffin, unless Forrest goes for a leg!"
223433,Cudz,2008-07-05 00:00:00,2652,If it stays standing Rampage will retain his belt. Both these guys are good guys.  Both have a great sense of humour and can laugh at themselves.
223467,MoriaRiverMan,2008-07-05 01:19:00,314,The wonderfull thing of this sport is it can go either way anytime.......  flash knock outs..............    mistakes causing submissions.......  So .......  Who will win.........  The lucky one !!!!!!!!!!!  The one with more edges than the other..........
223759,danbo,2008-07-06 10:40:00,2646,"Atta Boy,  Forrest!!     I lost the bet but the Coolest dude won!!  http://www.ufc.com/index.cfm?fa=news.detail&gid=13203"
223986,MoriaRiverMan,2008-07-06 23:59:00,314,Jackson did not lose this fight IMO.  Forrest got lucky the judges seen it his way.  They need to go again.........  Jackson was a great sport about it for sure though.........
223988,Terry,2008-07-07 00:04:00,14456,it was a close fight it could have gone either way but I was real happy to see Forrest win  but why did he quit kicking the leg
223990,misfish,2008-07-07 00:06:00,29133,"You try kicking a tree trunk that many times,and you tell me."
223992,MoriaRiverMan,2008-07-07 00:08:00,314,yeah should of stayed on his leg.......   but rampage should have threw a flurry once forrest dropped to the mat first round to............  rampage could have ended it easy right there...........for some reason he didnt throw any.......  cost him the fight !!!!!!
