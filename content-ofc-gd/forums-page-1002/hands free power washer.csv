I thought I would try out this new power washer out,it actually worked pretty good, i barely had to lift a finger to get it to work              These thing work great!!!! inside and out!!!!!    what ya think???? did she do a good job????  , I highly recommend this product and it should keep working just fine until it's starts to get around 12-13 years old        anyone ever try simular cleaning equipment and found it worked just great???"
223468,ccmtcanada,2008-07-05 01:20:00,7971,How much do you rent that washer for?  My boat could use a good cleaning too...LOL.  Very cute daughter jwl!!  My little one is 6 and she makes more of a mess than actual cleaning...guess I got the defective model???
223471,jwl,2008-07-05 01:26:00,1056," that's ok, the other 2 models I have became defective over time too, right about when they got 12-13-14  And you would be surprized, it was pretty cheap to rent actually, only cost me a popsicle"
