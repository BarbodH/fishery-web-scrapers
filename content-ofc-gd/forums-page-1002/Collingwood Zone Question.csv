223630,steve barrett,2008-07-05 20:51:00,142,Pretty sure you are right.Used to fish Huron a lot and as soon as my boat left zone 16 on the bruce the rules changed as soon as I hit the lake.I was now in Zone 13 same as Georgan Bay you are in zone 14.If one fishes the mouth of the rivers there is a small portion that is part of the lakes.Good luck tomorrow.
