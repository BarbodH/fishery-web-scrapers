223183,Dave Mercer,2008-07-04 15:29:00,148,"Hi All, I hope everyone is doing good and getting lot's of time on the water in. I just wanted to let you all know that I will be up in Sudbury on Monday July 7th. If you are free please come out and meet me for a free fishing seminar and meet and greet at The New Sudbury Center 1349 LaSalle Blvd at 7pm. It will be lots of fun and Subway will even have Dave Mercer Bobble Heads there. LOL I can die a happy man now I have my own bobble head!HAHA I would be great to see a bunch of OFNers out there see ya then  Dave Mercer"
223187,Joey,2008-07-04 15:31:00,9122,"Geez, when we were in the Sudbury area, you were down here.  Now we're down here and you're up there.  Make your mind up will ya  OMG, Dave Mercer Bobbleheads, now I've seen everything     I must get one of those  Joey"
223191,kickingfrog,2008-07-04 15:38:00,8333,Are the Dave Mercer bobble heads more suited to castin' or trollin'?
223218,tjsa,2008-07-04 16:49:00,1578,Float fishing or slip bobbering with the right attachments. The bobble head acts as a strike indicator   :D
223220,Roy,2008-07-04 16:50:00,13728,Thanks for the heads up Dave. A Dave Mercer bobblehead sounds cool but I think I'll wait it out for the Dave Mercer Pez dispenser. Good luck to you up there....I know you'll do well and the folks will come away with some fishing knowledge and a smile on their faces.
223223,ccmtcanada,2008-07-04 16:54:00,7971,"Bobble heads and Pez dispensers are cool....  When are the action figures coming out?  I'll wait for the action figure combo...boat, little fishing gear and action figure with movable arms and legs.  Push a button on the back and hear the laugh...."
223226,tjsa,2008-07-04 17:04:00,1578,Probably will be available at McDonald's when purchasing the Family Meal in the near future  :lol:  :lol:
223227,ketchenany,2008-07-04 17:04:00,3229,"The bubble heads will shaking side to side and saying ""No, no little buddy, I'm going to kiss you and put you back, not eat you like the other guy.""  Have a good time and have a wonderful turn out!"
223256,splashhopper,2008-07-04 17:44:00,2931,"does dave actually respond to any of these, or is this his press agent doing some ""Guerrilla marketing""?  We shall see."
223261,tjsa,2008-07-04 17:53:00,1578,"Sure he does, when he gets the time. It's him posting(probably). He has even been in the chat room one time that I can remember."
223312,Dave Mercer,2008-07-04 19:58:00,148,"Sorry dude, No press agent its me. As far as the Pez Dave that sounds good! If they ever come out with an action figure I hope it has the casting arm button.lol Maybe action figure Dave can hook up with Barbie!!! Who am I kidding I think a bobble head is as far as it goes.  Dave Mercer"
223315,GBW,2008-07-04 20:07:00,8460,"Sorry Dave but Barbie is a Vett girl (so I gater from my daughters stuff), not a Tundra lover... Have fun up there and enjoy. Geoff W"
