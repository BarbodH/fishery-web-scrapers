You seem to have picked this down rigg,n thing up pretty quick. Congrats on the 23 pounder.  You need to get a partner down there with you so you dont have to do it yourself. Wheres Sinker?

223617,Joeytier,2008-07-05 19:40:00,3990,"GOOD FISH!  I've been out four times in the past 5 days and hooked at least 7 fish every time.  This morning I was out off of Bowmanville, and went 7 for 9 with 4 rainbows and 3 chinook.  The biggest chinook was about 13 and the biggest bow was about 9.  The biggest chinook I've landed thus far has been 26, but a few more twenty plus fish have been boated as well.  Lake O has been very good to me recently!"
