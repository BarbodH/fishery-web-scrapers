223827,JohnF,2008-07-06 15:05:00,3494," I'm gonna be in Collingwood for most of the last week of July, boatless and in the company of non-fisherpersons, but I'd like to get in a little fishing while I'm there. I was hoping to maybe find some trout streams to play with the flyrod but hey, bass are okay too. Is that causeway down at the south end of the lake and is it worth the drive from Collingwood?  JF"
