222644,bbog,2008-07-03 14:37:00,665,"Given the vast amount of people out on the roads today that CLEARLY cannot drive it is refreshing that at least some people are failing the test. For far too long drivers licenses were handed out as a right. The MTO was too worried about ""offending"" anyone attempting the test. And what about the Scarborough office scandal (many years ago) where you could BUY a license without taking the test.  Our first priority should be for the safety of those that use our highways and if that means failing a few then great. I'd also be in favour of making the test MUCH more difficult and higher standards on the quality and safety of the vehicles on the road.  If you have the time - seek out the book ""High and Mighty: SUVs--The World's Most Dangerous Vehicles and How They Got That Way"" It's a great read with references to inexperienced drivers, vehicles that instill an invincible mentality, etc. Should be mandatory driver education"
222650,Dave Bailey,2008-07-03 14:50:00,1641,"Believe me, we would love to see that. The standards for instructors should be very high, and their are some people working to try to bring about those sorts of changes, but there are too many people standing in the way, people who don't want to see their livelihood jeapordized, those who don't want to have to actually learn something, and those who genuinely don't see a problem with the status quo.  I could name names, but the last thing any board needs is a lawsuit."
222684,Fisherman,2008-07-03 16:08:00,7201,Amen to that one!
222822,misfish,2008-07-03 21:22:00,29133,"Well I,ll tell ya two stories here. First one. Past my 365 with ease. Next was the test. I show up with an old beater my boss lent me from the garage. It was a shifter on the floor. Heres the kicker,I never used one,only the one on the steering colum. To add to this,all the letters were gone. I knew park was at the top but no idea where the others were. 16 and stupid,well not stupid but,anyhoo. I go for my test,doing ok til I make a turn and cut a guy off,after that it was parallel parking. Ok which way for reverse,up or down,guess where I stuck it? 2nd low. FAIL. I excepted that as I knew I screwed up.Lesson learned My second attemped I got my own car,shifter on the colume,69 dodge correnet. I have been practicing alot and was ready for the test again. Well I get to the place and theres this over wieght guy. Guess what,my seat belt does not fit him. He says come back when I get another. So I book it home,undo the bolt that holds in in place and shove a srew driver through the hole and pull it tight up against the seat. There no way this belt was not going to fit him. Do the road course through Brampton,he has a few pointers and a smart remark about driving an older car. Back we get, I pass. Cool,go in get my papers. Just as I am about to leave he,s about to get into another car. This is childish now I know,but I lit them tires up as I left (that car could do a great break stand show. I could see him shaking his head in my rear view.LOL Chill little one,it will come."
222826,Canuck2fan,2008-07-03 21:31:00,1444," I know lots of people on the farms around here who got their A rating with a pickup and a 5th wheel. The law allowed it and they took advantage of it. Now the sad part came when they went for jobs driving real tractor trailers to get off the farm, and they bent up some equipment.... One owner of a fleet around here soon learned that just because someone had a AZ for 4 years it didn't mean they were experienced..."
222827,Terry,2008-07-03 21:31:00,14456,"I passed my car license, then buy bike license, then my A class  license all on the  first try.....really    guess leaving 500 bucks on the passenger seat pays off....     kidding"
222847,danbo,2008-07-03 22:00:00,2646,"Gee, even my sister got hers..  "
222872,bigfish1965,2008-07-03 23:00:00,3382,"Failed my first time too. Took my test in a snow storm. Only fish tailed the old '77 Dodge tradesman van once..but that was enough...lol. Then about 19 years later, I get a letter saying I had to do my G test since my five years was almost up. No one cared that I had been licensed since 1984, they just knew the computer said I had to do the test. Long story short..I did the test while waiting for them to sort out the mess. I failed!  I didn't apparently slow down while driving past a school in July (never went over the speed limit)  or 'take precautions' while driving through an intersection while I HAD THE GREEN LIGHT! and 'paralell parked too quickly' and failed to look left/right while driving past 'dangerous areas'. So by the time we get back and the instructor tells me i have failed and have to keep my G2 (which I didn't have!) a supervisor comes out and says they found the computer error and tears up my failing test. They refunded my money and I didn't know whether to laugh or cry at the whole thing. I did manage to look at the testing parameters and what they look for before it got tossed..they do look for the dumbest stuff. Alot of it requiring drivers to not be looking straight ahead. The supervisor agreed with me the new standards were quite stupid since most accidents are caused by people not looking where they are going or what is in their path ahead of them."

222880,allbusiness,2008-07-03 23:15:00,23,"Take your test in Guelph, they pass everyone  I was doing 60 in a 50 zone and I kept palming the wheel instead of the 10 and 2 thing and I still passed  make sure you take it on a friday afternoon too, they'll be in a better mood and maybe a little more leniant than if you do it on a monday morning"
222888,addict,2008-07-03 23:43:00,475,dont feel bad its just another system scam pay the man some more and they will eventually give it to ya.
222922,Mattones,2008-07-04 01:31:00,587,here is a story for ya.  Last year or the year before my buddy was taking his G test. He was on the highway and someone was tailing him like crazy. Got off the highway and the examiner told him he should have sped up and was driving dangerous. He was going the speed limit in the slow lane as I was told. I guess they were having a little fight so he pulled over and told him to get the F out. and drove away.  haha  I booked my G test for the 17th but my car went belly up so I gotta cancel.
222962,Lostchild,2008-07-04 03:50:00,153,"The funny thing about it all is, that I bet you still got to drive your car home!!! Failed a driving test but still get to drive, now that makes sense!"
223007,pikehunter,2008-07-04 11:30:00,1659," Ironic, isn't it?!   Misfish, '69 Dodge Coronet! Nice!   Betcha wish you could have that car again."
223054,lew,2008-07-04 12:46:00,12767,"I got my license in 1961 up in Agincourt and used my Mom's little 1955 Austin A-35.  A funny little English car not much bigger that your kitchen table with a 4 speed floor shift and for turn signals, there was a big knob on the dashboard. When you turned it either direction, a lighted plastic arm would swing out from the side of the car pointing in the direction you were gonna turn  In order to swing the arm back inside the car you simply turned the knob back to center.  I was making a left turn and switched the arm back in before I completed the turn and lost a point for that. The driving tester had never seen a contraption like that before and I don't think he knew how to penalize me properly so he said he'd let me off easy  Crazy little car but me & my buds sure had some laffs in it for the next couple years.  "
223060,John,2008-07-04 12:49:00,2956,Not wanting to hijack the thread but I grew up in an A-35 Lew. Believe it or not at 5 years old I used to stand in the front between Mom and Dad and turn the signals (indicators) when Dad said he was turning right or left. Try letting your 5 year old do that today..........
223062,Roy,2008-07-04 12:51:00,13728,"Hell Lew, I got mine the same year in the same place! You musta been that big happy guy in front of me in line!"
223076,lew,2008-07-04 12:57:00,12767,"John, that's hilarious that your folks had an A-35 too, I just added a picture that I found on the net. Your right about the different rules today, you'd be tossed in the clink now if you let your kids do what we did.  And Roy, do you remember how Agincourt was waaaaaaay out in the boonies back then, man that was an expedition just getting out there.......today it practically downtown"
223273,Zubris21,2008-07-04 18:37:00,563,"I failed my first G test as well.  The evaluator said I had a ""rolling stop"" at a stop sign.  He asked me just after I made the turn if I though it was a complete stop, and I said ""Ya I'm pretty sure it was""  I guess he didn't like that response so he failed me.  Took the test again and passed with flying colours.  Just get out there and take it again as soon as you can.  I wouldn't go through the whole complaint, just seems like too big of a hassle, just swallow your pride and take it again!"
223278,ch312,2008-07-04 18:53:00,1590,"in order for you to fail a driving test you have to be a really bad driver (many people fail to admit this) or the instructor had it out for you. id choose the first option in most cases.  when i did my road test to get my G2 i had to merge onto the highway, drive around a few blocks, and park in a parking lot.  for my road test to get my G it was pretty much just a cruise around town until my left front caliper locked up so tight that id lay a patch every time i tried to move. flicked on the 4-ways to find the problem and then proceeded to the nearest parking lot doing what you should do in that situation. i passed with flying colors.  the bottom line is instructors can tell if you are very nervous or just a bad driver. if you know how to drive properly then its impossible to fail. ya always hear stories about ""perfect drivers"" failing, when its really just bad drivers blaming the instructors for not giving them the license they arent ready for yet.  my dad would have a new story everyday about what happened at truck driving school. sounds brutally easy to get your AZ"
223322,glirw,2008-07-04 20:12:00,200,"I passed my G test in Aurora less than 2 months ago 1st try, and my driving instructor wasn't a jackass. Nevertheless, go back there, take the test again, and show them what you can do! You will only become a better driver for it."
223667,Dave Bailey,2008-07-05 22:56:00,1641, He makes a powerful statement in favour of the re-institution of public floggings.
223714,BillM,2008-07-06 01:44:00,17367, Sounds like another candidate for a Darwin award
222436,wallyboss,2008-07-03 02:59:00,1095,"Good old drivers ed teachers.   I remember mine when i was a teenager. He had a cottage at the same lake as our cottage, my course was given on Sundays. So he would pick me up at the cottage, to drive into the city and I would get my driving hours this way.  Well what do most people do at a cottage on a Saturday night. They drink , so every Sunday morning he was hung over so he would sit in the passenger seat and as soon as we were on the highway he would fall asleep. And I was passing cars doing 120km/hr with Drivers Ed signs all over the car.  To say that a lot of drivers Ed teachers are in it just for the money , would be right.  If at first you don't succeed try and try again.!!!   If that tester thinks that you are not ready for your G2's then I am glad that she didn't pass you. Because I drive on those roads also."
222438,fishing n autograph,2008-07-03 03:00:00,2540,"honestly though, driving is a skill that everyone learns differently...me it took a few years to learn...others take to it like a duck in water.....  just do it again"
222533,1Harringtona,2008-07-03 11:48:00,77,"I wasnt making this thread to cry about my failed attempt on the G test. I was just voicing my opinion about what happend on my test and hoping that if anyone else had a bad experience with the Drive test so when I have a meeting with the supervisor I will have some backup on how terrible their examiners really are. Also since there are so many people who get licenses then total their car a few years after while killing a couple of people, maybe they should not just have the 5 week college course but maybe have a 1 -2 year course so they can actually find the bad drivers and pass the good ones."
222539,BillM,2008-07-03 12:00:00,17367,Suck it up and take the test again.  Having a meeting with the Supervisor is a waste of time...  I wouldn't consider anyone with no driving experience a good driver.
222544,danbouck,2008-07-03 12:05:00,4380,"Go to Brantford. I took the test the day after I bought my truck. I was use to driving a small car NOT a truck. I couldn't parallel park, do a 3 point turn and spun my tires by accident. I still passed. A guy i knew (DON""T DO THIS EVER) drank a 26er in his car before going in and ended up passing."

222557,4thgen,2008-07-03 12:30:00,157,"That sounds like the exact response that I got when I showed up in my 1990 civic si! Just try it again, hopefully you'll get a different instructer they all test differently.... BTW I passed. You don't really have to worry until you're on your third try or at the end of your five years like a number of my friends."
222563,Stoty,2008-07-03 12:36:00,2910,"Wow, this thread is going downhill fast.  Am I the only one that passed all three of my tests on the first try...??"
222564,pikehunter,2008-07-03 12:37:00,1659,"Although I should keep my mouth shut I got to step in and say a couple things.  This is a good learning experience for you and will make you a better driver. When you do finally get your ""G"" you will appreciate it and realize that a drivers license is not a right but something you earn and work hard to keep. I just wish that so many other drivers would make this realization and then perhaps the roads will be a safer place to be.  On behalf of PH Jr I must say that he is a decent driver who has been driving pretty much daily from Hamilton to Burlington since he got his first level of drivers license (G1 ? G2? I can't figure this new system out) You probably did make some of the little errors which resulted in the failure and don't realize it because as we all get more time behind the wheel we do become more complacent and get a little too relaxed at safety, if this weren't true then there wouldn't be any accidents. That also said I must say that I feel more comfortable as a passenger with PHJR behind the wheel then his mother  (now I went and did it  )  The important thing to remember about this life lesson is that every once in a while we all get pulled down from our high horse and it helps one become stronger.  Now that you've just turned 18 get out there and get your fishing license so you can go fishing! To heck with the car!!!! so we can read a fishing report!!!"
222567,Stoty,2008-07-03 12:45:00,2910,Well said dad! Lets just hope Mrs. Pikehunter doesnt read the post!
222591,Tarzan's Jane,2008-07-03 13:25:00,1183,"It's a disappointment for you...a bit of a hit to your pride...especially as guys will raz the heck out of each other...you no doubt did everything right in your mind but like your Dad said, you may have missed a signal or two...I passed mine on the first try many years ago but I certainly thought at the time that I failed...he would tell me to go right, I would go left....he would tell me to go left, I would go right...at one point he asked me if I had a problem, I just laughed. I would suggest that you cancel your meeting with the supervisor...re-do the test and maybe wear some cologne next time...just teasing.  Good Luck to you on your next attempt."
