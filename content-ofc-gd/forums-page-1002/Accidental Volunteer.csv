(i just  thought to myself: its a good thing this wasn't national hunting week) anyways, i went around and helped some kids with their setups,  gave some jigs, hooks, floats, bait. etc., by the time i checked my watch it was already 1pm and i only had done like 5 casts myself.  i left shortly after and anyways it was a really enjoyable experience watching kids and parents fishing for the first time."
