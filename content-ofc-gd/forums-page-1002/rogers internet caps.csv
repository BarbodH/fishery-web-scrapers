I had a bit of a shock when i opened the last bill and saw the $400 overage charge and forgot it didn't apply this month but this is the last month it'll be waived.  With bell set up to do the same thing, there's no way around it this time and it won't surprise me if we see all the broadband resellers  will do it soon."

222998,carp-starter,2008-07-04 11:04:00,253,I am confused. I am not understanding something.  You mean to tell me that there is a max in minutes per month use of the internet and if you exceed those minutes that there is/should be extra charges for using the net too much?  Thank you - carp-starter
223001,Beats,2008-07-04 11:10:00,543,"its not a minutes thing , its bandwidth.  You get charged now if you use over 60 gb a month.  For the average perosn that is way more than enough but for some pp, like myself, who use torrents and download movies and tv shows frequently, I can use 60 gb in a few days easily.I just use the log in feature on the Rogers website to check how much of the 60 gb I've used so far."

The base price is higher than residential, but I've never been capped and I don't get nasty little surprises on the bill.  You'll wind up with a static IP, if you've ever wanted to host a server of your own.  When I say non-Bell, I mean any other company that's small enough to keep your account straight.  If I listed everything Bell screwed up before I turfed them, and tried to pull AFTER I got rid of them, it'd take pages."

It might be 24/7 fetish porn downloads.      okay, only 1 of these is true.  I know a few people who used to have roger's business lines at home to get the extra speed but this was a few years ago when they were 5Mbps lines, i think, now i'm happy with the 10Mbps.   I don't understand why they keep increasing the speed without significant increases in bandwidth limits especially when everything on the internet is such high bandwidth now. ..like youtube and all those tv show websites where you can watch entire episodes of shows you missed.  I'm not sure what Bell's limits are now but Rogers broadband limits are 60 and 95gigs.  depending on which service you have.  I think some early adopters of ""extreme"" have 100G.    I'm like the other poster..i can use 10+Gigs on a good day so even 100G isn't enough."

Rogers/Bell even advertise to better enjoy higher quality video stream and all that fun things... yet bandwidth cap is becoming lower and lower than before.  No cable competition for them in there area so they do whatever the heck they want.  best bet is to shop around for new ISP (likely DSL)"
