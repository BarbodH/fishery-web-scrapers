223442,modny,2008-07-05 00:20:00,502,since my old man is working tomorrow i have no other way to tow my boat to hit the river..  so i was thinking of doing some sweet shore fishing somewhere..  its also family fish weekend so i was hoping somewhere maybe a lil remote so there aren't too many people around..   on a side note: is there anyone on the board who uses float tubes or pontoon boats? i'm thinking of gettin one and it'd be col to get a group of guys together and fish outta them
223444,Greencoachdog,2008-07-05 00:22:00,8163,Try a spot close to the water!
223449,fishboy,2008-07-05 00:37:00,550,Pier 4 (where the boat ramps are) might be busy but may be worthwhile as I think there's some sort of perch derby running.
223451,modny,2008-07-05 00:40:00,502,  thanks for the advice. goodluck with the poop smell.    ya bills bait and tackle is having a derby or something..... i've never really fished down there mostly because i dont wanna catch kife hammer handles or carp or anything..  i might hit the upper grand for some smallies or something
223453,Greencoachdog,2008-07-05 00:50:00,8163,  Take losta pics so we can see who smells like what eh?
223495,modny,2008-07-05 02:41:00,502,was thinkin of hittin the grand somewhere along #54 looking for nice structure to fish smallies

223566,modny,2008-07-05 13:50:00,502,do i need a boat?
223626,CLofchik,2008-07-05 20:15:00,854," Pssssst, there's a ton of bass down there.  I live around the block and just walking the dog with glasses you can see a ton sunning themselves in the afternoon.  Don't tell anybody though okay, just between us."
223628,Greencoachdog,2008-07-05 20:37:00,8163, Why would you need a boat to go shore fishing???
223638,modny,2008-07-05 21:49:00,502,"ended up going to binbrook. fished from teh boat ramp area  landed about 15 8-10 inch crappie, and kept 3 big ones for dinner. tasted nice and fresh  also landed 2 catfish.  on the way home i stopped off at a pond on the side of the road  caught about 6 LMB, not too big.. but about 12-14 inches maybe. considering the pond is chemical treated i think.  i was hoping for a toxic mutant bass "
