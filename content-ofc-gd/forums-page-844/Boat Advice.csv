Prices I found  Ultracraft on sale in town 2195 made by misty harbour Legend 2599 Wc 14 2400"
344605,Garry2Rs,2009-05-25 09:23:00,1425,"Take a look at the Horse Power and Load ratings.  In general, the higher they are the stronger and more seaworthy the boat. Check the actual widths and depth.  In general the longest, deepest, widest boat will be the most stable. The Lund is 14'6"" The Legend is 14'3"" The Ultracraft is 14'1"" Lund has a good reputation, that might mean a higher resale price when you're ready to move up.  I haven't looked at small boats in a long time, but Legend's used to be roughly finished...lots of sloppy grinding on the cast corners etc.  That might be okay if you are getting a better price, but in this case it's the most costly... I like the corner seats in the Ultracraft, it makes sense to make the rear seat sideways in a tiller boat. Some more opinions on small boats in general... Used is good, also ""non-current"" year boats are cheaper than this years models.   Boats with flat floors are nicer to fish out of.  Bench seats are the work of the Devil.  They are designed to be uncomfortable and they are too low to allow adults to stand up easily...pedestals are much better. There won't be much room to negotiation price wise, so you might be better off to accept their price, but ask them to throw in things like a safety kit, anchor and rope, PFD's etc. that you will have to buy anyway. Good Luck."

It handles rough water very well, has a high weight capacity, and overall is very well made. It can also take a 30hp motor. You might want to spend the few extra bucks and get the 14 Prosport, it has flat floors and a livewell built in. I have been seriously looking at the 16 Prosport recently, you will likely see me in one by the end of the summer! (Still working on the wife...  )"
