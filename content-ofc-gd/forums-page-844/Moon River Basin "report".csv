344520,siwash,2009-05-24 23:57:00,683,  First time posting a pic here so here goes.. Didn't make it to the Musquash as I planned so choose the Moon River basin instead... I couldn't find an exit area and parking spot for the Musquash...  Anyhow launch at Arnolds Bay... really nice area... but fish weren't cooperating... lots of sun and wind so it made my canoe ride somewhat uncomfortable and labour-intensive.. took a pic or two of some wildlife.. the pic I'm attempting to post is a fox.. but saw a ruffed grouse  and some beautiful waterfowl as well...  thanks to the folks who  helped me with my previous post...

344547,Rizzo,2009-05-25 01:11:00,4754,too bad about the fishing. There are all kinds of small lakes up that way. If canoe is your means of transportation you might want to explore a few smaller bodies of water. Those little out of the way lakes the fish are almost always cooperating
