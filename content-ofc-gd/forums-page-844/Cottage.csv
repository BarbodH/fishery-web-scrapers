Prefer a private cottage to a resort, haven't had a alot of luck searching the net, and it's geting a bit late. Any help would be much appreciated. Thought I'd add a pic of my biggest small stream speck of the year a real beauty for the size of streams I fish. Cheers ldub http://i168.photobucket.com/albums/u161/ld.../Picture597.jpg"
