About 20 minutes in I hooked a log or something and lost my favourite Mepp's Cyclops. I happened to see a pike sitting between some rocks just a few feet of the rocks and tried to get it to bite using a perch X-rap I had. I practically delivered the lure to the fish repeatedly and it would not bite.  After a few minutes of trying another, bigger pike came swimming up and I figured for sure one of the pikes will go for the lure. When the original pike saw the new pike show up it decided to head for deeper water with the new pike right on it's tail. About 20 minutes later the original pike returned and went right back to the rocks it was sitting in before. I tried a few other lures and finally the pike got annoyed and left. This area was fairly shallow for pike I thought so I moved to the mouth of the marina and other than some carp and one tern that thought my lure was a fish and took a dive at it, I didn't see anything of note.  I am still trying for my first pike. I am heading up to Kirkland lake in late June so maybe I will have some luck with those there country pike, because the city pike are just too sophisticated for my meager fishing skills."

Or if you've got one of DAVE MERCER's ""MERCER MAGIC""... those work great too... caught all my pike off those lures @ The Bluffs....    Good luck man!! Don't forget to post a report once you hook into your 1st!"
