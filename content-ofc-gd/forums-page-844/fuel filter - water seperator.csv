In trying to kill two birds with one stone I was thinking of adding a fuel filter/water seperator which would help to filter my fuel further and seperate any water while at the same time giving me a convenient way to tie into the main fuel system.   The unit I was looking at was made by a company called  seasense.  Will the extra filtering cause undue straing on my fuel system/fuel pump and potential damage/poor performance ?  Should I remove the existing fuel filter systems on my motors if I put this system in ? Any suggestions from anyone who uses them would be appreciated.  thx."

344481,ohhenrygsr,2009-05-24 19:41:00,947,don't tamper with the filtering system on the motor itself just install the fuel water separator and your good to go look at my post i did on your  other thread you made http://www.ofncommunity.com/forums/index.p...c=31401&hl=
344498,rob v,2009-05-24 23:02:00,535,"Thanks Henry -  I did refer to that info on the other post but it didn't really get into my question as to whether you needed to modify the engine's original filtering system - looks like you don't have to. \ When mounting these things do you ususally just find the most convenient place or should it be protected from the elements ?   I looks pretty ""weather resistant"" ."
