343616,CLofchik,2009-05-21 17:24:00,854,"Last year I did pretty good on pike in Hamilton Bay, three or four every time I go out.  This year......I've lost my mojo.  Nothing, nada, zip.  Been hitting it a few times every week since opener and NOTHING.  No strikes, not even a follow, I suck.  High water, so they should be shallow right?  Wrong.  A few whistletrout but the toothy critters have eluded me.  Tried everything, confidence baits, no confidence baits, baits I've never taken out of the package in five years after I've bought them, hard baits, soft baits, even soaked bloody smelt without a take (except for the damn sheepshead.....aaargh).  Anybody catch a pike in the 'Bay this season?  Have the cormorants eaten them all? Heh, atleast the pre-spawn carp are biting, only thing I can get on my line this year."
343633,Raf,2009-05-21 18:25:00,3495,"a good general rule is.. if warm water species like carp and gar have moved in, the water's warm and the pike are long gone."
343643,SBCregal,2009-05-21 19:04:00,688,"Clofchik  im with ya man, ive been out at lasalle, bayfront and the bridge by the RBG with ZERO luck.  glad im not the only one not catching fish out there!  ryan"
343704,Garry2Rs,2009-05-21 20:52:00,1425,"Did you-guys ""catch and keep""...maybe you ate them all last year...grin."
343829,Radnine,2009-05-22 01:42:00,1538,You know they didn't eat them out of the bay last year Garry 'cause they're still alive to make this post. Jim
343830,bigugli,2009-05-22 01:45:00,6138,The pike bite seems to be off in some Niagara spots as well.
343834,Greencoachdog,2009-05-22 01:58:00,8163,"Poike!... who wants to mess with those things eh?... target a more desirable species, like Rock Bass, Sheepshead or Steelhead or something!!!"
343850,CLofchik,2009-05-22 02:52:00,854," Actually the thing I noted most about the pike last year, was although they weren't giants they were all thick with good colour.  They were definitely in good shape.   Aaaargh I've been getting the sheepshead, and every decent one I tangle with I think is a pike at first.  Fun for a few minutes but a whistletrout ain't no 40"" northern.  And I know there's a few decent ones around........just not where I'm at!"
344179,fishboy,2009-05-23 14:16:00,550,  ahhh the much-maligned beautiful and elusive freshwater drum....natures equivalent of catching a boot
344189,shane,2009-05-23 15:07:00,652,This is the time of year that the pike shed their teeth to grow new ones.  They won't bite anything.
344190,limeyangler,2009-05-23 15:27:00,5204,"I feel your pain Clofchik, this time last year i was catching 35""ers every cast almost, this year its been much quieter."
344202,CLofchik,2009-05-23 17:21:00,854," Heh atleast down here there's carp that are always biting......maybe you should think about importing them, it seems to be the only fish you can't catch out of your backyard  Pummeled the carpio's this morn, have some errands to do then I'll give a final whack at Hammy hammer handles.  Being from Hamilton I just can't lower my self to fish for Toronto's stylish metrosexual pike, might give a few places around Niagara a shot this week.  I'm suffering from pike withdrawal."
