344368,Badger Shark,2009-05-24 04:26:00,291,Now that is scary!  Great pics!  Wish I could find my old fishing pics.
344091,Cudz,2009-05-23 02:02:00,2652,"Was going through a few photo albums and came across a few old fishing pics.  Thought I would share.  I have a bunch more but I can't find them. Most of these fish were caught with my dad.  Still one of my favourite things to do, fish with my pops.  Wish he didn't live in Alberta so we could do it more often. Hope you enjoy my little trip down memory lane.  Lake Trout - Lake Simcoe, 1985.  Check out my Miller Beer hat.  lol!   Lake Trout - Lake Simcoe, 1986    Drop Back Rainbow - trolling Wasaga Beach 1986    Smallmouth bass  4lb Lake Manitou, Manitoulin Island, 1988    Chinook (Father's fish)- Lake Ontario 30+lb, 1988   Smallmouth Bass - Lake Simcoe, 1989   Chinook - Nottawasaga River, 15lb, 1989.  (Note my mullet and my buddy's sweet tank top and EX hat)    Carp - Red River near Winnipeg, 1993.  Caught some huge channel cats that day but can't find the pics    Tarpon - Cairns Australia estuary fishing.  1995   Lake Trout - Lady Simcoe, 1999   Hamour (local name for grouper) Abu Dhabi, UAE, 2000.  I caught many more bigger ones than this but I can't find the pics.  It is not uncommon to get 20 - 50 lb specimans. "
344092,rbaquial,2009-05-23 02:04:00,968,Always nice to find old fishing trips and catches!  Brings back old memories! Thanks for sharing!
344097,Greencoachdog,2009-05-23 02:11:00,8163,I really like the way you could only find the pics of the smaller fish!  I've got underwear that're older than you are!!!
344100,Joey,2009-05-23 02:16:00,9122,Those are great pics.  Thanks for sharing them.  I love seeing the old clothes.  Joey
344101,limeyangler,2009-05-23 02:19:00,5204,Really enjoyed that.   I have to admit THE FRST THING I NOTICED WAS THE 'MULLET'   ..good one.   That Chinook your dad is holding is a beaut...he's grimacing trying to hold it up.   Thanks for sharing.   Simon
344104,kickingfrog,2009-05-23 02:29:00,8333,"  Hey Dawg in the days of film you didn't waste an exposer on regular sized fish, or has it been too long for you?"
344105,kickingfrog,2009-05-23 02:29:00,8333,DP=double post
344108,Cudz,2009-05-23 02:32:00,2652,"Yep, pretty sure I am wearing rugby pants in one of those pics.  Anyone remember those? I am not sure what I was doing wearing that hat and pink polo top fishing.  I blame Duran Duran for that."
344109,Greencoachdog,2009-05-23 02:36:00,8163,    ... if I want any crap out of you... I'll beat it out of you!... boy!!!
344112,rbaquial,2009-05-23 02:37:00,968,  Whoa boy!! FIGHT!! FIGHT!! FIGHT!! *Flickers lights on/off* Someone hasn't gone fishing today!
344113,Cudz,2009-05-23 02:39:00,2652,"Wow! lol! I want to see this. Rob is a very strong guy, but Dawg has experience on his side (and hopefully a big bat). lol"
344114,kickingfrog,2009-05-23 02:41:00,8333,"  You can't scare me Dawg, I've seen you in person."
344120,Greencoachdog,2009-05-23 02:58:00,8163,"  ... did I say that outloud???... what I meant, was after I sedated you with the Corn Drippin's...  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KsM_K1sChi4  It's a multi-purpose elixir yanno!  "
344122,kickingfrog,2009-05-23 03:04:00,8333,"Hee Haw was great. Right after it was Hockey Night in Canada.  And without Hee Haw I wouldn't understand a darn thing Dawg says, or types."
344123,bigugli,2009-05-23 03:08:00,6138," And the stains to prove it, too, I'll bet  "
344128,Sinker,2009-05-23 03:23:00,8692, Ya beat me to it!!   The pink shirt and ghey hat gotta go dude!! My old man woulda kicked my ass if I wore that outfit
344130,Greencoachdog,2009-05-23 03:29:00,8163,"  ... actually, they're like new... I only wear them when I go to the doctor yanno!"
344132,Cudz,2009-05-23 03:31:00,2652,"LOL.  WHat are you talking about??  That hat is the shnitz!!.  Mhy dad is/was hardcore.  He was 30 years in the military and I did not step out of line.  He told me that if I came home with an earing he would tear it out of my ear.  I believe he would do that.  My old man wrestled in college and was 33 and 1.  He is 65 today and I am pretty sure I would struggle against him now.   Once a boy came to pick up my sister and he was riding a motor bike.  My dad told him if anything happens to her, that he would kill him.  THe kid laughed nervously and my dad said it again, ""son I will kill you.""  The kid and my sister ended up just going for a walk that night. lol. The kid nealy pooped himself and I actually felt bad for him. My dad was fine with the pink shirt and I am pretty sure I bought the hat as a joke.  Wish I still had some sweet swag like that.  I would wear it fishing all the time."
344137,Sinker,2009-05-23 03:38:00,8692,"Well, it might keep the crowds at bay...... LOL.  Whatever your into man, I have an open mind  Sinker"
344143,jediangler,2009-05-23 04:29:00,1923,"Great old pics Cudz. I've wanted to do some scanning of some of my old pics as well.  Hats are to fishermen what pants are to golfers, you really have no limits as to how you express yourself.   Take this one for example, looks bad enough sitting still.  Add some speed and it really looks funny."
344160,Cudz,2009-05-23 11:53:00,2652,THat cat in the hat number is special.  I would definately wear that!
344286,Sandbag,2009-05-23 23:47:00,533,Those old pics are great Cudz  UAE....would love to see it and fish it...How long were you there?...visit or working?  Cheers  Craig
344309,Cudz,2009-05-24 00:49:00,2652,Lived in Abu Dhabi for 6 years and 2 years in Dubai. I have some really good sailfish pics.
344327,Leecher,2009-05-24 01:29:00,7832,Awesome Cudz Thanks for taking us down to memory lane Leechman
344359,ccmtcanada,2009-05-24 03:36:00,7971,Great bunch of pics!  I love seeing the older ones...looks like a full life of fishing for you!  Lots of great times and memories with each one I'm sure.
