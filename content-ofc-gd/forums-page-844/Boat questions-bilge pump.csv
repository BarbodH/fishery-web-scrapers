I just got my first boat, an old fibreglass 14 footer (Peterborough Boat) and I've got a few questions. At least I'm sure I'll have more than a few questions but I'll start with this one.  The boat is equiped with an Attwood v625 bilge pump. Is this thing automatic? I can see it's hooked up to an outlet hose and into the wiring but I don't see an on/off switch anywhere. I've got another question but I've got to pick up the wife. Back in a second. Thanks for any input. Rossco"

344482,Sinker,2009-05-24 19:42:00,8692,"Yeah, there could be a float switch in the bilge somewhere, or it could be attached right to the pump. Take another look, or even take a picture and you'll get the right answer here.  Sinker"
