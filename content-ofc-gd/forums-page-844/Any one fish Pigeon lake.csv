343795,jediangler,2009-05-22 00:39:00,1923,Sounds like you have the north end of the lake figured out. Just keep the same approach in different locations.
343978,Jeff Wiles,2009-05-22 18:17:00,55,Is there any other good spots to try and is there any place to set up a tent along the lake.  Jeff
343985,jediangler,2009-05-22 18:47:00,1923,"There are many private campgrounds as well as Emily Provincial park in the south near Omemee. No place that you can camp for free unless you want to take your chances with trespassing charges. All of Pigeon is good, some spots are just better than others."
343995,muskeybugged,2009-05-22 20:02:00,282,On the long weekend I seen a group of people camping out on an small Island on Little Bald - legally or not I'm not sure.
344035,Pigeontroller,2009-05-22 22:36:00,2793,"The back side of Boyd Island has many established campsites, might be tough to beat the Houseboats to them...And they leave their mess behind...As far as asking for help on the fishing, what is it you want to catch?"
344139,Sinker,2009-05-23 03:40:00,8692,"  Just a heads up, those sites are COVERED in poison ivy. And I mean COVERED!!!  Sinker"
344222,Jeff Wiles,2009-05-23 19:01:00,55,MUSKY      Why there is other fish in this world worth catching  :D   Jeff
