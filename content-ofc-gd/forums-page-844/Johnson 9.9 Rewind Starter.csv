I've been able to get the link back into the cam but it's not an easy task. Is there a proper way to reconnect the link? I basically had to force it back in place with needle nose pliers and yet it still came out. I'm wondering if I'm missing something that is allowing the link to come loose so easy? I'd appreciate any advise on this.  Thanks  Mark"
