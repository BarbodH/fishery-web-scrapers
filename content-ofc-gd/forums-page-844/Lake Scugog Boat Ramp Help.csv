344474,fish-miester,2009-05-24 18:18:00,864,was wondering the same thing .. I know for a fact theres a launch in View lake.. tho you basically have to beach your boat. but look on the plus side.. its free..

344483,fish-miester,2009-05-24 19:44:00,864,its where i launch most of the time as i find ceserea to be hectic with the nice weather
