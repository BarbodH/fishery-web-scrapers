344088,Dutch,2009-05-23 01:59:00,831,"Looking to get out to a few dealers to see some boats on display.  Mainly looking at Lunds, Sylvans, Crestliners in aluminums and Triton, Nitro and Stratos in glass boats.  Have looked at a number of pictures on-line, but it doesn't give you the real picture of climbing up in and moving around in one.  I've gone to a few local places, but they only have 1-2 boats on display.  Any dealers between Peterborough and BPS that would have a few different models on display to get an idea about set-ups?  Anyone seen any local boats for sale that are in good shape - Looking at Kijiji hour after hour is starting to wear on me, especially after missing out on a few boats so far.  Ideally, I would go to the boat show - but my time machine is broke.....  Thanks for the info."

Joey and Tybo were looking for a boat recently and couldn't find a selection anywhere, the dealers claim that it's the economy these days. You have to order with a 12 week wait!  They ended up buying what they wanted from a U.S. dealer that met them at the border with the boat."
344162,cranks bait,2009-05-23 12:01:00,721,I too had this problem when looking for boats.  When ever I was out and saw a boat in my list I would ask the owner if I could take a look.  i ended up buying my boat unseen from a local dealer.  If you come down here there is a Lund Alaskan 18' and Explorer SS 17' that you can look around at.  I also saw in the paper last night that the car dealer in Belleville had a used Nitro for sale.  The one on Hwy 2 and Wallbridge road.  My boa took two months to come in.  Hastings Marine looks like they have a few boats on the web page as well.

344175,BUSTER,2009-05-23 13:40:00,1336,"http://www.repodepo.ca/Boats/ i'd take a look here and save yourself some cash, lots of people lost jobs and couldnt pay for their toy's!!  I was also  told never pay their asking price offer 20-30% less than they are asking you have to register(no cost) get a log in name and password like a chat forum then it'll show the asking price  good luck"
344187,Bigfisherman,2009-05-23 15:02:00,100,"I had the same problem too, plus had my old boat to sell. But I did find old 08 stock had to drive 3hrs away. I was only looking at 16ft boats that would fit in my garage. I would say the US is the best bet especially if you can get the dealer to bring the boat over for you even better!"
344198,ecmilley,2009-05-23 17:09:00,2163,"drive stright down the 115 to boatland canada they have tracker, triton, nitro, fisher ect then after you chect all that out you can head over to d.t powersports in uxbridge and check out the newer rangers and lunds"
