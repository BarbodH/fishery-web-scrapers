I was 14 and he told me to play it cool when it comes to the ladies and not to take any crap from anyone.  Hmmm.   He said that, or maybe he said; ""Cook's Bay has some good largemouth in it.""  Can't remember exactly what was said but he was my idol at the time and he is still a great fisherman and a great Canadian.  ""To Chris Real Fishing! Bob Izumi""   I am so stoked about this pic.  I forgot I even had it. "
344129,Sinker,2009-05-23 03:24:00,8692,I ran into Bob yesterday on simcoe. Good guy to shoot the bull with for sure.  Sinker
344134,Cudz,2009-05-23 03:33:00,2652,"What were you fishing?  Whities, lakers or pike?  Was he filming or just fishing?"
344136,Sinker,2009-05-23 03:36:00,8692,"He was out for whities. I talked to him at the launch first, then he pulled up right beside us and started fishing. They had 2 boats, 5 guys, 2 cameras filming. Bob nailed one almost instantly. He's just a little guy in person eh...... LOL.  Sinker"

344363,ccmtcanada,2009-05-24 03:52:00,7971,Great pic!!!  My dad used to play golf with Bob before he became a fishing celebrity....LOL

344503,crappieperchhunter,2009-05-24 23:12:00,2582,When our kids where small our babysitter was Bob's wifes sister.  I always hinted to Nancy's 2 girls that I would LOVE   to go out fishing with there Uncle Bob.  Met him once but never did get out fishing with him  Everyone from our sitter family said that whenever they got together with Bob... which wasn't often...he always spent more time playing with the kids then socializing with the adults. Sounds like a good man to me.
