343773,holdfast,2009-05-21 23:50:00,1813," Careful now, let me tell you a little story in Chilliwack BC.  My kids used to go to school just outside the Base called Watson.  For some Reason there are a lot of Creeps in that area.  Clifford Olsen being one and another guy I heard Personally as he was in the same Trade as me but I never personally met him.  We as parents used to get quit often Predator alerts in the mail from the school.  Basically who to watch for.  Anyways one day I was picking up my kids and I noticed a van parked on the Road outside the school with a guy casing the place.  He even went into the school yard and obviously was eyeballing all the kids around him.  I thought nothing of it since there were many Parents and staff milling around.  I guess this mother called the cops and the cops picked up the guy for questioning.  Two hours later when he could prove who he was, RCMP released him as he was a Father looking for his Kid.  My Point is.  Thanks to these predators, I always felt it uncomfortable to be affectionate with my Daughter in Public because of Paranoia.  TID BIT----  There was one time that I was heading up towards Chilliwack Lake and the Mountains with my four year old Daughter when I got stopped by an RCMP at a surprise Road side check Point.  He asked how I was, Where I was going, and who is with me.  Heres what impressed me about this smart Cop.  Awesome Questioning techniques.  He looks at my daughter asks her  Whats your name? So your going with your Dad  to fish?      Once he got her Talking  So where is your Mom? How is your Mom?  Obviously the Cop was being mindful of a kidnapped child.  So off I went with a Bag of Beer and one opened."

344421,Radnine,2009-05-24 13:22:00,1538," I couldn't agree more. I have personally pulled over at least three times and asked people if that is their kid they just picked up. I mean actually pulled in front of a car that stopped to pick a kid up off the road. Once I followed a car to get the licence number, which I called in to the police to check out. It just looked dodgey, like the kid had to be talked into the vehicle. On that one the coppers even got back to me to tell me that all was good. I'm am not self back-patting here (no doubt there are many reading this that may think I'm a pain in the ass) but I wanted to say that in every case the person I talked to thanked me for stopping. Every time. In my school (high school) there is not an adult that comes close to the building without being approached by someone (can I help you, who are you here to see? etc.). And I know from going into other schools for various things that it is usually the same way. I often have to tell more than one person who I am and why I am there and am happy to do it. As far as I am concerned there is no down side to being aware of your surroundings. Think of how differently things might have turned out in Woodstock if someone would have engaged Tori's abductor, if only to talk about the weather. Jim"

People need to follow the news and watch timestamps before they jump on a comment..  In a way.. death penalty is good... but I would prefer to see them in jail for life with no chance of parole.. a long slow painful death is what it is.. let it eat them away inside for what they did..   let people inside the jail take care of them..  but the jails need to cut back on the ""amenities"" that they give inside those places!"
