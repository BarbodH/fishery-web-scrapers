Marked fish fairly steady all morning, switched things around until the rods started firing and it was steady for the 4 hours we fished. Warrior  and dreamweaver Firecracker was hot and took most fish. Couldnt get the wire to go, all fish off riggers from 60-100 ft down. Nothing very big, but we did manage to pick up an atlantic with a hair lip, quick pic and back it went.  tightlines  Ryan  "
