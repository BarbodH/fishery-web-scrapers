344457,fish-miester,2009-05-24 16:21:00,864,"Good luck ! caught one last night on an X-rap fishing for walleye.. beauty fish !  though defenetly look into bucktails.. and a good rod and reel, i preffer more of a low profile baitcast reel, such as the curado 200-300s, or the revo's.  but the other guys defenetly said it, check out musky canada, go to the meetings etc, you can learn so much !"
344459,fisherfellow,2009-05-24 16:27:00,4,"thats awesome meister, were you in scugog?"
344460,fish-miester,2009-05-24 16:29:00,864,"yes Sir,  just aiming for walleye .. but through out the summer and fall they can sure be a blast to fish for!   ps. where are you looking  to fish for them ?"
344461,jediangler,2009-05-24 16:33:00,1923,"Remember guys, they don't open for 2 more weeks yet."
344463,fisherfellow,2009-05-24 16:35:00,4,"anywhere in southern ontario, drivin distance of toronto basically......."
344464,fish-miester,2009-05-24 16:38:00,864,"yes sir, and cant wait ! though if you do run into them before open season, say fishing for walleye you should release them immediately, or cut your line !   if you can make it out to Kawartha lakes, such as Scugog, or Rice, you can normally find them all over.."
