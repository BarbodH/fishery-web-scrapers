We could not have picked a better day to go fishing.  The weather was amazing and Lake Erie was glass for most onf the morning.  We were targeting bass but we happen to fall upon a huge Sheephead and Walleye bite first thing in the morning around 6:30am.  Barry with the first fish of the day!    Barry with my two fish.  He always wants to be in the pictures with the biggest fish.    After that bite died off Barry went on to put on a clinic on Smallmouth.  He caught at least a dozen fish before I even caught my first.  Barry with the first Smallmouth of the day.    Barry caught this SOW (Another word for HOG!!!!!!!!!!!!!) near the end of the day.  This fish was probabaly 6 3/4 pounds and measured just over 22"".    In total we caught over 50 Bass, 12 Sheephead & 4 Walleye.  What a great day on the water."
