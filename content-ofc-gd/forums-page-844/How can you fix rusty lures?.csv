344216,BillsTheBassMan,2009-05-23 18:40:00,932,"Hello All,  I've recently been buying up old stocked tackle boxes from random places for good prices and making new lures and salvaging any gems that I may find.  I guess my main question would be this:  Is there an inexpensive way that I can get the rust off of some of these old lures?  Are there any do-it-yourself solutions to de-rust tackle?  I certainly don't mind replacing rusty treble hooks or O-Rings, I mostly want to salvage the spoons, spinnerbaits, and other interesting metal oddities that I have found.  Also - it is important that whatever format is used to derust lures does not leave them with a long-lasting scent that could potentially scare away fish!  Any help is appreciated!"

344221,Jeff Wiles,2009-05-23 18:58:00,55,WD40 works Some old guys will say it helps you catch more fish  Jeff
344223,MillerPhoto,2009-05-23 19:07:00,147,"Sandblasting..  Depending on how much your willing to spend, and how often you need to use it..  I would reccommend the Cabinet one, but if you don't have a compressor or don't want to spend that much, go with the Ez Blaster Kit..  Canadian Tire - Sand Blasters"
344226,BillsTheBassMan,2009-05-23 19:40:00,932,Thanks for the responses fellas.  I will definitely try the WD40 today at some point (you've got to listen to those old guys!)  Here are some other things that I came up with on my search for general knowledge:  1) Pencil Erasers will remove tarnish on lures 2) Soaking rusty lures in lemon juice for 5 minutes 3) Gently rub rusty lures with AJAX  I would suspect that vinegar and baking soda work as well.  I'm going to start with the inexpensive methods.

344257,Guest gbfisher,2009-05-23 22:02:00,0,If they are jst sppons with no paint. Use an SOS pad.....
344568,holdfast,2009-05-25 02:06:00,1813,"Not sure about rust, but to put the shine on them, boil Patatoes and scrub the lures with the water.  it really works."
344580,tschirk,2009-05-25 02:32:00,261,Braso or Silvo polish
344602,Garry2Rs,2009-05-25 07:38:00,1425,"Tooth paste is basically baking soda in an easy to use format. A stronger cleaning product is called something like Dentu-Cream. It's a tooth paste for false teeth, and since it's used outside the mouth, it can have much stronger stain removers and coarser polishing ingredients. I have used it to clean-up rusty looking lures and it works quite well. By-the-way, don't trust rusty hooks, even when they seem to clean-up okay. It doesn't take much rust to severely weaken old hooks."
344610,Whitespinnerbait,2009-05-25 11:03:00,2038,Gather up all rusty lures....Then lop them   in the Garbage........    Unless you want to keep them as Collectables or for Show ...
