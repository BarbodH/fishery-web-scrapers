344352,dada2727,2009-05-24 03:18:00,108,I think I read somewhere on this forum that you could get shimano reels repaired in peterborough.  Can someone please point me in the right direction?
344374,rbaquial,2009-05-24 04:51:00,968,"Check out their website - they SHOULD have a ""Authorized Dealers"" or ""REPAIRS"" type section.... and you should be able to find locations in ONTARIO.  I know of one in Mississauga... I think its called ""AIKMAN SPORTS""... near DUNDAS & HURONTARIO (HWY10)... I think its just WEST of HURONTARIO... on the NORTH SIDE of DUNDAS. Not too sure they deal with SHIMANO tho... I know they do for DAIWA... May want to call them...  Here's the INFO...  Aikman A Sporting Goods Repair 3010 Novar Road Mississauga, ON L5B1S4 P#: (905) 277-3595  PS: Here's the  MAP  EDIT: I forgot to mention... its in a very small MALL STRIP literally about 4-5 stores wide...I don't think they have any visible ""ADVERTISEMENTS"" or anything visible from the street..... and its the LAST BUILDING on the NORTH SIDE (Strip runs NORTH/SOUTH)"

The guy to talk to there is named Bud. When you find the building the repair door is located through the gates at the back of the building.  Sorry I don't have an exact address or last name for Bud, but he is a whiz at repairing rods and reels.  Tom."

344585,Garry2Rs,2009-05-25 02:50:00,1425,"Shimano Canada Ltd. 427 Pido Road Peterborough 705-745-3232 The strip mall location has been gone for a year or two. Since they moved to the new building, everything is handled out of the one spot. Bud Benwell is still the man to see."
344661,Tom McCutcheon,2009-05-25 14:52:00,627,That's the place and Bud's last name. Thanks Gary. My mind is not the same since I became a senior.......  Tom
