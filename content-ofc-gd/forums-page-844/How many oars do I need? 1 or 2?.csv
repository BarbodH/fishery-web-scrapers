344017,Fisherman,2009-05-22 21:29:00,7201,Did you actually pass the safe boater course?
344027,Sinker,2009-05-22 22:02:00,8692,You don't need any if you have an anchor on board.  Sinker
344046,Fisherman,2009-05-22 23:32:00,7201,"Ya, you don't need oars if you have an anchor, however I think the jist of it is ""motion"", kinda hard paddling or rowing with an anchor."
344072,DRIFTER_016,2009-05-23 01:05:00,10439,"  Well I LOSE it!!!!!!!   Last time I heard the Champ was driving through Thunder Bay, he still losing it there?"
344111,nancur373,2009-05-23 02:37:00,1211,I did actually. With a 94% grade. Why do you see fit to bash a guy for making sure he is legal and safe.  Curt
344200,POLLIWOGG,2009-05-23 17:11:00,835,"Where did you do your coarse Bobby Zummi  grad or internet?  How much you pay for it.  If you got your money's worth and you don't know you should at least know how to find out, thats why he's bashin you, but I guess this is one way to find out."

344214,Fisherman,2009-05-23 18:39:00,7201,"Well it seems that a litle bit of sarcasm didn't fit the bill so I'll explain a bit further. Like others said, you can go to the Safety Site and find out the answer.  Although it says you only need one oar or paddle on board, I could sacastically say that there's nothing illegal about paddling or rowing around in circles. Furthermore it also says, you may need an anchor with chain or rope, but it doesn't give any specs on the rope or chain so I suppose you could use your other halfs gold neck chain or some flimsy rope.  When the occassion happens that you need to save your bacon, I would suggest that it's a bit more efficient to row with 2 oars, or having a sturdy piece of rope or chain for the anchor to keep from drifting away.  It appears there's still a bit of distance between legal and safe.  The end."
344253,POLLIWOGG,2009-05-23 21:45:00,835,"I think its called sculling ,when you propel the boat with one oar but its a bit of a lost art and I sure wouldn't want to start to learn it in a hurry in bad weather.  Anchor or oar is just another dumb thing, anchor should be mandatory.  I guess the answer is do you want to use it or hold it up for the cops to look at."
