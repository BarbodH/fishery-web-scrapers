My chauffeur dropped me off at the pond by 7 and my good friend, Bill/Smerchly, joined me at 8. We had us another one of those  50+ fish days for each of us. White and yellow perch, drum, cats, crappie, pike, and some OOS stuff. The only thing not biting were the carp and sunfish. This was my wake up call.   Didn't take too many pics. Too busy setting and resetting lines all day.     The first sighting of the season.   Despite the fact I look, and feel, like a cooked lobster now, it was an excellent day."
