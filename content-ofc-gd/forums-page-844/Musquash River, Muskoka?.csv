Was thinking of putting around in my canoe in that area... is it accessible from the highway? Can you park there w/o issue? Is the water flat and calm or should I expect strong currents or rapids? I was thinking of paddling up to or beyond Gray Lake.  Any other alternative rivers/lakes in that area that might hold a walleye or 2 or some pike?  Thanks much in advance!  "
