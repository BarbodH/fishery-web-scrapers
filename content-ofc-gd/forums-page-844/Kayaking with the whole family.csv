My daughter took the dog with her but it jumped out and swam over to my wife in my kayak. More room for it in there anyway. After they paddled around awhile I got a chance to get out and caught this pike on my first cast.  It wasn't big but it was too big for a butterfly net. That didn't stop my daughter from trying though.  She tried for awhile after that, we only had one pole between us, but resumed her frog hunting after 5 or 6 casts. I caught an even smaller one half an hour later but that was all. More of an adventure, less of a fishing trip. The dog still smells like pond scum   ."
