38445,The Urban Fisherman,2007-02-22 22:09:00,2050,"Hey all,  Sorry to start another non-fishing thread but I'm really starting to get frustrated.  My GF and I have been searching for an apartment for nearly FIVE MONTHS now without any success.  The problem is that we have two dogs (a yorkie and a beagle) and NOBODY wants pets.  We also have a 4-month-old daughter (Averie).  I'm working full time as an assistant film editor and doing some side work to help save some extra cash.  Ginny's studying psychology through correspondence to finish her undergrad, then starting her post grad @ U of T next year.  We have a limited budget of around $900.00 a month just because we'd like to put some money away.  Our dogs are currently living with our parents until we find somewhere new to live.  We even had one place say the dogs were ok but they didn't want a baby living in the basement!!!  We'd like to rent part of a house, either the main floor of a tiny house or a basement apartment that allows access to the yard.  If anyone knows of any available apartments please let me know!  We'd prefer the west side of the GTA because of family being near by, but are open to anything that would suit our needs.  Thanks for your time!  Cheers, Ryan"

38550,irishfield,2007-02-23 00:56:00,26272,"Ryan, you'd be close enough for her to walk to U of T and not sure about their pet policy...but I've definitely watched people walk there LARGE dogs out of there. My daughter is at 280 Wellesley (corner of Wellesley and Parliment) and the two bedroom with large living room/dining room is $1050/month. Pretty sure the sign said vacancies when I was there last. They have three buildings, underground parking, pool etc and at least some grass (to walk the dog) around in the complex. I can get contact info if you are interested...when she comes back from skiing at Blue tonight."
38558,The Urban Fisherman,2007-02-23 01:17:00,2050,"Fishergirl: thanks - she's a cutie to..check out the website I made her if ya want www.freewebs.com/averiebonin  IRISH: REALLY appreciate the response, unfortunatly 1050 is a little out of our price range... but again thank you very much for the response!!!!"
38560,irishfield,2007-02-23 01:22:00,26272,One bedrooms would probably be $100 or so cheaper. Guess that would be tough with a baby and the dogs. A simple curtain on tracks changes the dining area to a bedroom. Did that when ours were babies and we lived in an apartment.
38564,PatrickGG,2007-02-23 01:29:00,562,"Theres a unit available in my building and most tenants have pets here p.m me if you want some info.  P.S I live in the Parkdale area, 10 minutes from the downtown core."
38651,fishergirl72,2007-02-23 03:17:00,455,"Hey Ryan, I tried to check out the website and for some reason it would not work out for me."
38704,ccmtcanada,2007-02-23 04:05:00,7971,That is one cute little girl!!!! Great site you have set up for her.
38753,verno,2007-02-23 10:53:00,178,"Find an apt you like and can afford.  Don't tell them about the dogs.  They can't kick you out for having a pet.  The only time they can do something is if they can prove that your pets interfere with other peoples reasonable enjoyment of their property.  So if your dogs bark or you dont clean up after them, then they can do something.  14. A provision in a tenancy agreement prohibiting the presence of animals in or about the residential complex is void.  2006, c. 17, s. 14. http://www.ontariotenants.ca/law/act02.phtml#RTA14  To contact the Landlord and Tenant Board (the Board) by phone you can call us at 416-645-8080 from within the Toronto calling area, or toll-free at 1-888-332-3234 from outside Toronto. Hope this helps.  And Wayne you have a PM"
38770,Greencoachdog,2007-02-23 11:37:00,8163,"Dogs are ok, but keep those pesky babies away... you know how those babies are, always getting into the garbage, chasing the cats, chewing up the furniture, and lifting thier leg on everything!!!"
38890,fishnsled,2007-02-23 15:53:00,3520,Great to see you getting some help here Ryan.  Hopefully something comes up for you and the family soon.  Fishnsled
38902,The Urban Fisherman,2007-02-23 16:28:00,2050,"Thanks for all the replies guys!!! muchly appreciated - hopefully something comes of it!
