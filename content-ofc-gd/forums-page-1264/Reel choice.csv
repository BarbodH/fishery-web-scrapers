38746,taper,2007-02-23 07:15:00,611,I just bought a new jerk bait rod and am now looking for a reel to pair it with. I think I have narrowed it down to 2. the Shimano Solstice 100 or the Quantum Energy E10PTI. I really like the Quantum but the Shimano has the rear fighting drag. Any opinions on either.

38812,JFR,2007-02-23 13:54:00,498,"I have several Quantum spinning reels, and really like them, never had a problem with them.  Quantum/Zebco has been building reels for many, many years, and until a couple of years ago were made in the US.  Now because of stiff competition from off shore, they now come from off shore, but they are maintaining their quality control."

38836,danbo,2007-02-23 14:43:00,2646,Daiwa Tierra!     tackle review here  check it out here!  
38853,David Chong,2007-02-23 15:05:00,836,"Good choice on going with a spinning outfit for jerkbaiting! When fishing with jerkbaits a smooth drag is essential and the suggestion of a Daiwa Tierra by danbo is a great choice. Daiwa has the best drag bar none! A front drag is also smoother than a rear drag, rear drag is great for convenience! Good luck! Dave"
38876,taper,2007-02-23 15:27:00,611,Oh sure just when I thought I had it narrowed down to 2.  :wallbash:
38887,bigbuck,2007-02-23 15:44:00,2449,"I'd go with the Quantum, it's a nice reel but go with the 20 size, it's a bit bigger and tougher to deal with the toothy monsters of the deep."
38909,Tacklebuster,2007-02-23 16:46:00,303,"I have about 12 reel, all Shimano and Daiwa from $70 - $300.  The Shimano are nice and I have no complaints, but there is no doubt in my mind that Daiwa makes a superior reel.  My best rods get the Daiwa's, and then I go down the line...so to speak."
