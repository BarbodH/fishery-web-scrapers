38488,Bernie,2007-02-22 23:24:00,3190,"Geez Wayne, hope those precious MOPAR parts are still OK. Like to see a pic of your car sometime too."
38509,irishfield,2007-02-22 23:46:00,26272,"Gurrty is our resident lonely Grouse... that Misfish will never forget as long as he lives! I think it was love at first sight....  Art/Nipp...I'm just gonna let the snow melt and worry about the parts later. I've survived a perfectly good 3 story building collapsing, in Cabbagetown, onto me in 1980. I'm not going to temp fait crawling into something that's 80% of the way to a pancake already...as I know what will happen when I move the first object!"
38584,fishindevil,2007-02-23 01:59:00,6254,"that sucks wayne,i hope alot of your parts and things are still salvageable??? well good luck and you are right about not going in there till you can asses the situation with the snow,its amazing what snow can weigh...."
38760,cisco,2007-02-23 11:18:00,597,Glad your OK Wayne. Wise move leavin it alone till Spring.
38868,bigbuck,2007-02-23 15:21:00,2449,Good idea to wait until it melts. Having that thing come down on top of you will definitely leave a mark. Hopefully the contents are not too badly munched.
37871,irishfield,2007-02-22 00:45:00,26272,"So much for my 40' storage trailer and some of it's contents.    I'll have to wait to spring to see how much of my '68 to 70 MOPAR spare parts are toast. The oil furnace I had in there that I was getting around to installing in my shop, boxes of stuff from previous moves, spare old stock aircraft seats and frames etc. Looks like my aluminum bar stock and tubing survived...it's just on it's side now and a little hard to browse the shelves or to get any of it out to use. I've had the trailer beside the hangar and 8 feet out from the wall for 14 years without the snow making it that far out. Guess it got a little better run at it ths time!      "
37874,Motorhead,2007-02-22 00:49:00,163,That sucks..... but it`s amazing to see what a big pile of snow will do...  Be glad you weren`t standing there or in it at the time....
37876,Smokey,2007-02-22 00:49:00,1278,Sorry for the loss but cool pics.
37878,tinbanger,2007-02-22 00:51:00,1028,Oh geeezz !
37880,Joey,2007-02-22 00:53:00,9122,Ouch!!  Good thing you weren't walking near there when it happened.  An Avalanche in Ontario burying you would be some news story.  Joey
37886,Rich Clemens,2007-02-22 00:58:00,3131,Man that does stink.  Hope you can get a lot of your stuff outta there in good shape.  Dang glad nobody was around when she came crashing down.
37902,camillj,2007-02-22 01:14:00,1988,Ouch ... just be glad that fancy new boat of yours wasnt parked there (mental note for next year ... boat note safe beside hangar)
37907,Daplumma,2007-02-22 01:21:00,1961,Wayne you must feel like you went thru a redneck divorce..or a tornado..Sorry bout the trailer hopefully the contents faired better than the shell. Joe
37915,Eddyk,2007-02-22 01:24:00,195,Thats to bad Wayne. I hope your insurance will cover some of your loss.
37921,irishfield,2007-02-22 01:30:00,26272," Insurance companies aren't worth calling unless u've burnt something to the ground! $1000 deductible, loss of our 15% claims free discount for 5 years minimum would = at least another $1500. Trailer isn't worth that much and I have another out in the back field that can take it's place in the spring. My main concerns are my spare Mopar parts...like complete spare NOS instrument clusters for my '69 Bee, and many parts like it."
37934,GbayGiant,2007-02-22 01:44:00,1780,Hopefully you can salvage those parts once you can find your way in.
37975,Bly,2007-02-22 02:27:00,1556,ouch!  Got my fingers crossed for you that you can salvage at least the most important things!!   bly
38139,Whopper,2007-02-22 11:53:00,2174,Ouch!
38144,Big Cliff,2007-02-22 11:58:00,6899,That is sad to see. There are some things that insurance just can't replace. I hope that when you have a chance to get in there most of it will have survived.
38145,misfish,2007-02-22 12:01:00,29133,"Man what a mess wayne.   Hope gurtty is ok........................  Sorry,just trying to make light of the situation bud ."
38147,motv8tr,2007-02-22 12:20:00,2587,"Yup, that hurts, but be glad it wasn't the trailer with the car in it...that would really hurt.  Maureen"
38152,tjsa,2007-02-22 12:45:00,1578,OUCH!!  Hopefully you can recover those items Wayne.
38167,dustink,2007-02-22 13:25:00,526,"Yuck!  Sorry to hear about that Wayne, but glad no one was hurt!!  dk"
38175,Headhunter,2007-02-22 13:56:00,5703,"Doh! Sorry to hear that Wayne... looks like mother nature forgot her sense of humour! As already mentioned, just really glad no one was standing near it when it came down! A good opportunity for an ""inventory check!"" HH"
38177,Beans,2007-02-22 13:57:00,3339,DANG !!!...if it ain't one damn thing it's an udder  I hope you can salvage most of it...  :wallbash:
38244,fishnsled,2007-02-22 15:40:00,3520,DOUBLE DANG!!  At least no one was hurt and hopefully you'll be able to salvage most of your inventory.  Fishnsled
38246,irishfield,2007-02-22 15:42:00,26272, Yah...she was standing there with her wing tips on her hips...shaking her head back and forth staring at the mess when I arrived. She liked to hide under the trailer..
38305,JFR,2007-02-22 17:23:00,498,"Holy Sh!t, material things can be replaced, glad you are safe  John"
38427,aplumma,2007-02-22 21:37:00,6896,Get out the shovel and go get them NOS parts they are worth the diggin. You could also rent a few small kids and force them in their too just tell them to pick up anything that looks cool.  Art
38486,carll2,2007-02-22 23:17:00,443,"wow..snow can really do some damage..hope you were able to salvage some stuff, btw is gurrty  one of them turkeys you have around your house?"
