Lot F at the boat ramp is closed off as there is a midway set up there ,so looks like the lot next to it (G?) will have to suffice .As most will be there early hopefully parking won't be an issue .Late arrivals ( my wife and daughter) may have a tougher time of it. TB  I'd pay money to see a bunch of floater suits on the Tilt and Whirl !!"
39139,Joey,2007-02-23 22:38:00,9122, I'll double what you pay  Thanks for the heads up on the parking.  Joey

39181,Clampet,2007-02-23 23:51:00,1947,Thanks fer the heads up.
39186,Terry,2007-02-23 23:58:00,14456,so where will the chitter I mean porta potty  and the food and the prize table be and does anyone know if we can get down to the ramp with atvs and whatnot.... if anyone know....dang..life is tough
39189,glen,2007-02-24 00:05:00,2641,The chitter is at the ramp 4or 5 of them.  They are sitting up a midway.  There is a no ATV sign at the ramp.  but there is a trail through the park just before the ramp parking lot.
39196,Terry,2007-02-24 00:18:00,14456,"as long as we can get  the ATV to the ice, we are good thanks"
39200,tinbanger,2007-02-24 00:29:00,1028,Terry You should have no trouble getting on the lake from the other lot .Maybe 100yds max and nice and flat. We should try a grab the parking spots closest to the lake and perhaps haul a couple of picnic tables over for bbq and prizes  TB
