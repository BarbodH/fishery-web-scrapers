TB  btw I'll throw a garbage can and bags into the trailer tonight . I can dispose of our garbage on Monday at work ."
33690,Loonietoon,2007-02-12 21:02:00,1450,let me see what I can do for the buns Cliff
33752,irishfield,2007-02-12 23:16:00,26272,Calvin...you do the foot work to go buy the buns/bring them to the G2G and I'll reimburse you for their cost when I see you at the G2G'r. How's that sound?

Sometimes we all work at fishing, sometimes we all work at another goal, like Motiv8tr's Tyler program.  One person  really can make a difference; you are a great model for us all, Maureen.  I am looking forward to meeting all youse folks, fer sure.  Shame on the no shows, like Roy, for e.g."

27733,Beans,2007-01-28 19:59:00,3339,"I know this was mentioned on another thread but as our M&G is on the Saturday of license free family weekend it might be a good time to bring a friend who has expressed an interest in icefishing but needs a license...I'm sure most of us will have extra equipment that we could lend them to get a ""hands on"" feel of what it is all about..."
27744,Woodsman,2007-01-28 20:45:00,1286,Maureen: With the Winterfest will we still be able to drive to the parking lot by the ramp within the park or will they shut the park down to vechicle traffic? It would really s*ck if we had to walk & pull all our equipment from god knows where. Beans: I can not agree more. I'll bring some extra equipment just in case.  Best Wishes: Rick
27859,motv8tr,2007-01-29 01:05:00,2587,"Hey Rick, the road to the parking lots including the one near the ramp are open, but it is first come first server for a spot .  Winterfest was held on the same weekend as our first G2G and we had no problems.  Maureen"

If anyone from the east end needs a ride, let me know, I have room for one person and their gear. HH PS... I'm for the moment assuming that the cold weather of late, will have added some inches to the existing ice. Can we drive out from there, ie the ramp, assuming the ice is thick enough?"
32621,Big Cliff,2007-02-09 11:05:00,6899,"Sausages, sausages, sausages.  They were by far the most popular item last year.  Mild & medium.  Anyone got a lead on some?  Tonyb, sorry you may have posted on the # of chicken breasts you will be bringing and I've missed it. Do you know yet how many?"
32679,tonyb,2007-02-09 14:40:00,1637,"  Hey guys!  I picked up the desert bars and chicken breasts last night.  I'll be getting the BBQ sauce and Ketchup this weekend as well so you can scratch those items off the list.  Chicken breasts are big, full size actually and there are between 100-125.  I think a regular hamburger bun will be too small for these, so keep that in mind.  Probably a larger Kaiser style bun will work better.  Desert bars - WOW!  They gave me a sampler of their products, here is what is listed on their website:  Traditional Nanaimo Bars, Rich Deep Dutch Brownies, Tripleberry Crumble, Lemonburst Macaroon and the innovative tiger striped Triple Chocolate Chunk Brownie  Sauces - BBQ Sauce and Ketchup enough for the day (I will confirm the quantity when I pick it up to make sure it will last the whole day)  Getting excited now, only 14 more sleeps!  Tony"

Actually I will try to give a call this afternoon.  They did say that if I needed more than they were able to donate, they would provide it at cost, so that will help.  Maureen"
32948,Big Cliff,2007-02-10 10:50:00,6899,"Thanks Tony, that's a BIG help.  Buns, anyone got a lead on where we might be able to get some buns donated?"

33491,Big Cliff,2007-02-12 11:37:00,6899,I think we are still waiting on Moe to find out what Sobye's is going to donate so we can figure out what else is still needed.

They will give us the hotdogs and buns for free, and will give us everything else we need at cost.  I think that's a good deal and we should take advantage of it.  I am on vacation next week and am able to go down there, or it can be picked up the morning of the G2G.  All I need to do is give him a call a couple of days ahead of my going down with a list of what I will be getting so he can have it all together when I get there.  So, what do we need?  Hamburgers, buns, Kaiser type buns for Chicken breasts, sausages and buns and condiments...now Cliff is this too much?  maybe leave the sausages out in place of the chicken???  I dunno, that's why I left the BBQ to you  , you make the tough calls ...lol  Let me know and we'll go from there  Maureen"

33680,Big Cliff,2007-02-12 20:48:00,6899,"How is this for a deal Moe. You get the sausages 100 ea. and what ever doesen't sell I'll buy for cost + 10%. You (Tyler) can't loose! I do remember when we started last year thinking ""Sausages?"" but they were the biggest hit! so now we need buns!"

22008,motv8tr,2007-01-13 18:27:00,2587,"Well it's beginning to look like we might get some ice after all, not that I would have cancelled this great event  .  I think this year will be bigger and better, I can feel it in my bones....or is that the cold  3rd annual Fishing for Tyler Get together.  Tyler French is ten years old, lives in Alcona ON and is autistic.  We are holding our third annual ice fishing fund raiser/G2G on Sat February 24th, 2007 at the Innisfil Beach Park boat launch, to help raise money for Tyler’s much needed ABA, speech, and other therapies. This year we are hoping to raise enough money to help Tyler get a special bike so that he can develop more physically as well as share in a family activity of riding bikes together for the first time.   Time: 7:00am check in, last fish measured at 1:00pm, prizes to follow . Cost: 16 and over, $10.00min., under 16 no charge, but donations gratefully accepted.  Pizes: 1st, 2nd and 3rd for the longest Perch, and the same for the longest Whitefish/Laker , with a draw following.  To get there, take Hwy 400, or Yonge St. to the 8th line (Innisfil Beach Rd.), Go East on Innisfil Beach Rd, to the end, turn left into the park, follow the rd. to the right, past the snack bar to the boat launch.  Once again we will have the BBQ going at full steam, and hot drinks available, and hopefully a return of the Port-a-Potty. This year it looks like we will have a couple of special guests as well, but I'll wait until I get more info on that  i can't find my copy of the map, but it is on the earlier thread.  I will create another thread regarding the prize table.  Looking forward to seeing all of you this year.  Maureen"
