38664,huntervasili,2007-02-23 03:24:00,1604,There are some really good tyers out there... definately wouldn't fish with one of those pieces of art... I like these too though...   
38668,MJL,2007-02-23 03:25:00,2427,Totally awesome flies  I've seen the site before but I still get the same feeling of amazement each time.  It would be bittersweet to hook a fish on those flies only to have it mangled or snagged on a log.  Most of the flies I tie can be done in 5-10 minutes at most.  After that I just don't have the patience to tie something that would potentially be destroyed.  Thanks for the link
