However . . . .     as I went to mark this on my callendar, I discovered April 15 is a Sunday. Since I thought this a little odd, I mentioned it in a reply . . . . .      checked again about 11:30 . . . .      couldn't find the post? I suspect quite a few people may have seen this . . . .     and I'm surprised no one has asked? Just curious . . . .     what is the story . . . .     unfounded or (mistakenly) erronius info?"
