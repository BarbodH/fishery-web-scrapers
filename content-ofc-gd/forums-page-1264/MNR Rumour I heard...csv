38614,TJQ,2007-02-23 02:37:00,7806,I was told tonite that some oragnization in Sudbury was holding a bake sale this weekend in Sudbury so the MNR would have gas for thier CO's... and that the MNR refused to take the $$$ that they said they cant accept funds from the public...  (not like my taxes lol)  Like I said this is hersay.. but apparently it was on the news... anybody else see it??
38617,TJQ,2007-02-23 02:39:00,7806,Oh... I know what happened .. they spent all the MNR's money on CBC's special on serial rapists...
38620,ccmtcanada,2007-02-23 02:41:00,7971, LOL...still on that are ya TJ?
38623,bigfish1965,2007-02-23 02:45:00,3382,"There was an article in the current OOD isue about the bake sale in Sudbury (?). It was more of a protest over the current situation than a genuine fund raiser. If they wanted to raise cash for gas, they should sell beer."
38632,fishindevil,2007-02-23 02:50:00,6254,"well how bout they hold a fishing derby...lol..lol,its a sad day when the public have to give them gas money so that they can do their jobs.  ..we should all remeber this on the next election aand let our MP's know what we think...like they will care anyway...but its still a crappy mess the M.N.R is in and there doesnt seem to be a way out .  ..due to the buget cuts they just keep cutting,and cutting...rrrrrrr it makes me mad"
38633,camillj,2007-02-23 02:52:00,1988,No that wouldnt work Rick .. then they'd have to deal with the liquor licencing people ... and that's a whole different kettle of fish
38636,bigfish1965,2007-02-23 02:55:00,3382,In Sudbury I think licensing is not really an option.
38641,camillj,2007-02-23 03:03:00,1988,Doh ... what was I thinking !
38685,Garyv,2007-02-23 03:40:00,547,Let's all remember this when the Ontario elections come up this fall. The Provence has lots of money to build smoking rooms for the casinos ( but won't allow private businesses do so ) but no money for the MNR.  I guess you got to spend money to make money!
38696,outdoorguy61,2007-02-23 03:55:00,220,"The business and operations model for MNR has been substantially ""gutted"". If it was a wakeup call, hopefully the workers and powers that be got the message and that the current government does a pre election cash infusion.  The actual day to day operation could and can be better.  Just a message from a long distance tax payer that has seen many ways of conducting the business.....of the outdoors.  outdoorguy61"
38710,fishforfun,2007-02-23 04:19:00,105,"TJ in the Bruce peninsula we had a CO named Tost hard nosed nonforgiving guy. He took early retirement why? So he can now defend all conservation law breakers and deny his bosses all monies they were receiving from fines, sad state of affairs."
38759,SlowPoke,2007-02-23 11:09:00,2984,.... on the water.
38774,Handlebarz,2007-02-23 11:55:00,3790,Well we had a nice boat in dry dock all summer last year here no gas money I did not see the MNR out until the fall whe nthey were targeting Duck hunters. They have had many cutback and I just found out that at the end of the month the Chatham Office is closing to the public the desk girl was already gone and you can not get a licence there either. if you want to see someone you have to call and make a appointment. I had gotten luckey and bought my licence that last day they were selling them and found the info out when I asked wehere the cute blond girl was.
38792,Corey,2007-02-23 13:01:00,355,"Without trying to start any arguements, for the last month or so I have seen MNR trucks driving up and down the QEW quite a bit. At least twice aweek and I am on the highway between 3 and 4 times a  day from various places to places, all between Hamilton and Niagara.  cd."
38834,fishnsled,2007-02-23 14:40:00,3520,When the MNR stopped in to visit us on the weekend up in Temagami (the report is coming although not much to report) the guy told us that they had been office restricted for the last month+ do to gas restrictions.  Last week was the the first week out for them up there.  Apparently they should be fine up till the end of their fiscal year.
38850,danbo,2007-02-23 15:00:00,2646,I figure all the Big $$ Fishing Tournament Organizations should be paying to Re-stock the lakes they hammer every year...jmho  Our MNR  needs to have a complete overhaul & learn from successful neighbours like our American friends in New York State.
38894,Handlebarz,2007-02-23 16:07:00,3790,corey they do get out in the winter here its does not cost much to run the quads on the ice and the ice fishermen are usually in big groups so they can get to them they are out here daily in the winter and do quite well. I just dont understand where the money goes from the fines myabe ther should be more of it going to the MNR gor things like gas and wages.
38895,Guest lundboy,2007-02-23 16:10:00,0,"The Sudbury issue is absolutely true.  The bake sale was held at the Brockdan Hotel on Highway 69, just south of Highway 17.  As mentioned earlier there is an article in the Feb. 2007 of Ontario Out Doors that talks about the embarrassing situation.  I suspect with the rearranging (consolidating) of zones, that there will be less MNR offices as well.  Probably this redirection of MNR funds by the McGuinty government has also led to the delay in publishing the 2007 regs guide."
38996,The Urban Fisherman,2007-02-23 19:11:00,2050,well looks like i'm going to have to step up and start voting... UF
