37990,John Bacon,2007-02-22 02:43:00,3277,I saw this at the Fishing Show.  Did anybody else check it out.  I would be a neat toy.  http://www.admiraldrive.com/float_overview.html
38015,BFSC Kevin,2007-02-22 03:13:00,1351,"not bad! but the design has some faults. like when you need to tow the boat out of the water, but the bar is on the motor side, which is the deeper side and you will need to flip the boat around in order to tow it out."
38111,BFSC Kevin,2007-02-22 05:30:00,1351,"even so, you must turn the boat/trailer around so you can get to the tow bar, which is wehre the motor is, unless you plan on backing in at the ramp, and in that case, you will need to pull the motor out of the water and then there must be a dock so you can get out and pull it backwards manually to the truck.."
38608,John Bacon,2007-02-23 02:27:00,3277,"Yes, it would be kind of awkward to pull the boat into the ramp backwards... especially if you are going to tow it with the ATV that is in the boat.  However, I think it would be difficult to have both the gate and the trailer tongue at the front of the boat.  By the way, it is available with a cover and removable floor plugs so that it can serve as an ice fishing hut too.  It is kind of heavy to tow out onto the lake in camparison to a portable ice hut though."
