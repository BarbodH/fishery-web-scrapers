38536,fishergirl72,2007-02-23 00:39:00,455,"Thank you smokey! And Jen, thank you for you very kind words. And Bly, Thank you so much for calling me this afternoon, it was good to have someone to talk to and knew what I was talking about and helping me understand why she suffered like she did, you were great to talk to, it was a real comfort, and you are a good friend, I might just take you up on that offer on going out for a coffee."
38538,Roy,2007-02-23 00:41:00,13728,"I'm not much of a condolence person, Julie. It's life...it's how it works. It is a strange situation that the more family and friends you have, the more likely you are to be 'hurt' more often. It's also strange that should you have but very little family and friends, a loss will (should) hurt you more.  Everyone has conveyed the important message....be strong and remember the good times. Remember also that wherever she is, she will remember you as a person who cared.  Be well...."
38583,Bly,2007-02-23 01:55:00,1556,   Anytime Julie

37980,fishergirl72,2007-02-22 02:34:00,455,"It is so strange that I just made a post on who you would love to spend 2 days with and my mom called tonight with the sad news that my cousin just passed away this evening. We have no clue on how she passed away which is the fustrating part of the whole situation. A family member thought it was weird that they did not hear from her as she called everyday,(she was always quite lonely) and she went to check on her and she found my cousin semi concesious barely breathing so she was rushed to the hospital and just when the paramedics got her to the hospital, she stopped breathing and they revived her but she passed away very shortly. The family is requesting an autopsy which will be done tomorrow. We are thinking that since she had so many problems and was on so many meds, that somehow she got confused somewhere along the lines and possibly overdosed by accident but we will not no for sure until the autopsy is complete. She had a very hard life but was a good and kind woman and I am just glad that last summer and the last holiday that we were there I often vistited her, to sit and chat and have coffee. She always loved company. When this happens it often makes you realize and think that anyone can go at any time and it is so important to always be kind to your loved ones and to let them know that you love them and they are important to you because you will never know when they can be taken away from you at any given day or moment and you don't want them to leave this world thinking or feeling differently on how you felt or how you thought of them . I really don't have any friends but I know that I have some friends here, that is why I came here for comfort. I am going to miss her."
