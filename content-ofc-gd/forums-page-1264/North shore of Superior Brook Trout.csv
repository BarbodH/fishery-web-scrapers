38312,solopaddler,2007-02-22 17:30:00,8605,"Well, it's the dead of winter and I'm bored, so figured I'd share another trip with you guys. In the spirit of Lew's great thread about fishing with your father,  these trip photos depict the one and only time my dad as well as my uncle accompanied me on a canoe trip. They were both in their late sixties at the time and used to their creature comforts. I really wasn't sure how they'd handle it 'cause it's not a cakewalk, but they did just fine! In fact they loved it! We did this trip 3 years ago in May, once again to my secret honeyhole lakes north of Superior.... (sorry again about the poor pic quality, but hey they're better than nothing right?  )  If these pictures look familiar, I posted a similar series of shots a while back crossing the same river with my old Suzuki Samurai. This time we beat the crap outta my uncles Jeep      There's my dad on the left, uncle on the right (they were pumped after we made it over  )    While walking along a portage, my uncle found this little Brookie trapped in a pool of water    The old boys walked the shoreline and I donned my waders and lined our boat and gear upstream (the bush is way too thick to portage)      My dad taking a break on a beaver dam    Eventually you come to this awesome spot where the water flows over the bedrock into a lake. Trout stack up here and it's an easy spot to fish...          From that point it's a bushwhack into our final destination. Here's my dad geared up and ready to go    This is a tough portage. About 1200m with bush so thick you've got to drag the canoe (no trails either...)    Here's our destination. Beautiful beach campsite overlooking the lake        Eating around the campfire    Here's me along with my uncle cooking up some trout under the tarp. (forgot to mention it was freezing cold the entire time we were there)      My dad never goes anywhere without his brandy and cigars    My uncle landing one    Me with an decent one    My uncle with a stringer of small eaters    My uncle      My dad    Landing another    My favourite cleaning rock    I've posted pic's of this spot before...It's a waterfall you pass on your way in. We usually spend the first night here, but opted to camp here on the way back out. This is one of my favourite pictures.....Absolutely gorgeous spot!    My dad and uncle relaxing at the same spot      Well, that's about it....hope you enjoyed the pic's!"
