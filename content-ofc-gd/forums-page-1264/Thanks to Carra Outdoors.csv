38576,charlied,2007-02-23 01:44:00,584,"Thanks to Sam and the other guy at Carra for helping me out last week...even thou I got skunked at Quinte they offered some great info and had some real hardy minnows that lasted like 6 days I think.  It was my first time there and I travelled far and they were very helpful and even said I could callhim anytime if I had an emergency.  It made me feel good to know that someone I have never met before would be concerned about me cause I was by myself on quinte over night when it was -29 with the wind. Thanks again guys...this comes alittle late, sorry!"

On a similar note, Moon's Bait in Deseronto hooked us up this week as we landed many walleye with some size to them as well, our first time on the BOQ.  Glad to hear there are still people out there willing to help strangers catch some fish.  Good luck to everyone the rest of the Hard Water season!"
