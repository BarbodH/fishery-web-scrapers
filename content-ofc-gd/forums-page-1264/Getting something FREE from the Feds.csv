When they did away with the old system (Firearm Acquision Certificate)  a few years ago I needed to take and pay for a course send them over $130.  If anyone has received the papers in the mail as well, you should have a look at them because you may be able to get you PAL compliments of the Federal Government  Now that don't happen everyday."
