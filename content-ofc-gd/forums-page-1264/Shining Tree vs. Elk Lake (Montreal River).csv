They both look great, but I haven't been to either place.  I'm hoping some of you have been to one or both of these places and can offer some thoughts on your experience.  I'm planning to arrive for Walleye opening and stay for a week targeting mostly pike and walleye.  The two lodges I have in mind are the Bay Wolf Camp in Shining Tree, and the Twin Bears Resort in the Montreal River.  My last year's trip to Gowganda was not as productive as I had hoped, though the lodge itself was just fine and I did have plenty of fun.  This is basically my only fishing trip for the whole year, away from everything to be lost for a week, and so I'd like get the most out of this opportunity.  Any and all input will be greatly appreciated; thanks in advance."
