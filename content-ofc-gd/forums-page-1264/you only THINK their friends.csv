38216,Guest gbfisher,2007-02-22 14:58:00,0,Friends are one thing Lew.   Aquaintances are another.  My friends don't know what a fishing site is....  
38264,misfish,2007-02-22 16:15:00,29133,"Just to prove my point,I had a BUD/DUCKY drop by work today and drop off a gift. To me thats a bud/ducky even if we havent fished together yet. LOL   Thanks TB.  "
38276,Davis Battah,2007-02-22 16:27:00,31,10-4 Lew  Chin up.
38761,Handlebarz,2007-02-23 11:21:00,3790,Dang Lew I did not know that hurt you so much for me to change our date in July   JK I still want to get a make up date maybe for the first week if we get up there if not I will have to just bite the big one and take a day off from work to get out that would suck maybe I will be sick that day  I hope what ever it was that hurt ya heals quick for ya Lew. I know I have met some great people from the internet and hope that I keep them as friends for life and others can just be released back into the internet fish pond.  Big Cliff well said that about sums it up. I have one and only one BEST FRIEND he is my Bro From out in B.C. I know no matter what he will be there for me like ya said cliff we can go weeks or even a couple months and not talk but no matter what I will always be there its funny like that.
38787,OhioFisherman,2007-02-23 12:49:00,6623,"Sort of a standing joke between me and one of my best friends"" why are you calling me? it`s not fishing season"" We keep in touch, for 30 years, do stuff together besides fish, but not often, I know I can count on him if I need help, I try to avoid that. I am there for him! Just the way it is sometimes.  Cliff said it well!"
38790,tinbanger,2007-02-23 12:58:00,1028,"Looks like you got lots of 'friends' here Lew , Enjoy your mini holiday.  Misfish ...just wanted to shut you up  TB"
38818,PatrickGG,2007-02-23 14:10:00,562,"I know how you feel Lew, I myself gave up a lifestyle for my family and lost a lot of friends in the process and as of today my family is all i have."
38849,bigbuck,2007-02-23 14:59:00,2449,"Lew, Big Cliff said it very nicely, I'd like to add that if you make one good solid friend who you can count on to be there for you, you are lucky, any more than that, consider yourself rich. I have 2 such friends and consider myself very fortunate, we don't see each other that often any more because of family, work, distance, etc... but when we get together, it's like no time has passed since we saw each other last. I hope things work out for you, you seem like a stand up guy and I don't like seeing people down. Musky season needs to get here quick, a good workout with a 50+incher should perk you up."
38863,danbo,2007-02-23 15:16:00,2646,We all luv ya Big Guy..your worries will pass!
38971,kennyman,2007-02-23 18:24:00,737,"I feel, being a newbie here that I almost shouldn't comment on a subject like this,because I don't really know you Lew, but it seems to me the timing is awfully close to your daughters mishap. Somehow events like this are sometimes eye openers. Seems like we go through life coasting alot and every once in a while you get slammed into a wall and you are forced to open your eyes. Sometimes we don't like what we see. Anyway,I could be way off base here. If I am disregard what I've said. You know, you seem like a real nice guy Lew. You go out of your way to help others. I'm sure your handshake is as good as gold too.  Whatever it is that driving you nuts,just give it a few days and I'm sure it won't seem quite as bad. Take care there big guy."
37766,lew,2007-02-21 22:23:00,12767,"It's interesting how over the years we each gather a circle of friends on  message boards, or at least we THINK their friends anyways, and then sometimes things happen in our lives, and we realise that unfortunately, maybe we didn't have quite as many board friends as we originally thought we had.  It's strange actually, cause sometimes,  old friends really aren't, yet strangers actually are.....  I spose it's good to re-evaluate stuff from time to time  anyways though, and just put everything in it's proper perspective so it's easier to understand where things and people belong.  This should make sense to some, and will mean nothing to most, but I'm done now anyways and no further reponse to this thread is required.  Thanks, that's all I wanted to say......."
37773,Joey,2007-02-21 22:33:00,9122,"Lew, everything okay bud?  Speak your mind if you want to, we're here for you.  Joey"
37779,Bernie,2007-02-21 22:40:00,3190,I dont know you too well Lew but from what I have read and from what others say about you I would have to say you are a stand up guy.
37782,Gerritt,2007-02-21 22:45:00,6129,Uhmmmmm..... Everything ok big guy?   Gerritt.
37786,mukluk,2007-02-21 22:51:00,196,Hey Lew; You are a class act.  You do have a lot of friends and respect on this board.  Anyways muskie fishing is just around the corner!
37788,Squid,2007-02-21 22:57:00,1656,06-15-07 cannot come soon enough.
37813,Guest Trophymuskie,2007-02-21 23:30:00,0,Some of us understand way to well. I've learned not to trust anyone and I mean anyone. As some people will stoop to any level to use you in the worse of ways. One can be a best friend for a long time and in a flash become the worst of enemies.
37814,Puckhead,2007-02-21 23:30:00,377,"I hear ya.  Some folks tend to be who they want to be online, not who they actually are in real life... don't sweat it.  As Clampet said, if you've got one really good mate, you are doing better than most - and I'm sure this message made it's point to whom it was intended."
37819,pigeonfisher,2007-02-21 23:40:00,696,"Interesting point, I don't know from where?"
37829,TJQ,2007-02-21 23:57:00,7806,What did i do this time?? LOL  Chin up Lew!!
37835,camillj,2007-02-22 00:02:00,1988,Ya what did TJ do this time Lew ?  
37843,GbayGiant,2007-02-22 00:12:00,1780,"I don't think it's healthy to have no trust in others, but a back up plan is a good idea because you really never truly know who to rely on, including family sometimes. A man of his word goes a long way, if I shake someones hand it's a contract in my book.  As far as forum friends, I think it's a good way to meet people, but I wouldn't rely on them in need. I do believe there are class act people on this site however that are willing to help complete strangers and it says a lot of your character and I like to think I fit in that category if I have the ability to help others."
37844,Eddyk,2007-02-22 00:15:00,195,I know your not upset with me because I netted your 53 inch Musky last fall at Nippissing.
37854,aplumma,2007-02-22 00:22:00,6896,Give a holler if I can help you out bud. I am sorry that someting is not makin you happy.  Art
37896,glirw,2007-02-22 01:07:00,200, No it Can't !
37899,camillj,2007-02-22 01:11:00,1988,Easy fellas ... lets not turn that clock ahead too fast (Im getting old and wanna actually enjoy the little time I got left) ... besides the 16th is my birthday  so Im in no rush
37950,DT10Sam,2007-02-22 02:03:00,480,"I'll always be in your corner Lew and with a few others we can lick them all  .  Regards, Sam"
37957,TJQ,2007-02-22 02:11:00,7806,I can take you too Sam... well  maybe not... but my WIFE can!!!!  LOL
37966,camillj,2007-02-22 02:16:00,1988, What ? Lick em all ? COUNT ME IN !
38124,Big Cliff,2007-02-22 08:52:00,6899,"I think the word ""Friend"" is often missused and I believe there are different levels of friendship.  A casual friend; someone who you are happy to see and spend some time with, you may not have a lot in common but you are comfortable with them. I have a lot of people that I enjoy spending time with but they don't hunt or fish. They are just fun to be with.  Close friends; people that I know I could count on to go out of their way to help me if I was to ask for help and I would do the same for them. That doesn't mean we talk every day or anything, sometimes we might only see each other a few times a year but if we ever need each other..... As an example Lew, if I called you and asked you to come up here as soon as you could because I really needed you, would you come? I'd bet you would as quickly as you know I would for you.  A close friend is a person on whom you can confidently rely on to help pull you through the hard times, and hold you accountable for your actions. A friend is loyal.  A friend will not judge you for who you are, but they will help you to grow in life.  Best friends; Well, there are a lot of people that I like and respect very much but to say that any one of them is ""My Best Friend""! I think I would have to reserve that for my wife, my kids, and my dog Andy.  Then there are those other people that call you friend but will stab you in the back the second they get the chance. It's too bad that things like that have to happen but they do. In the end, they are the big loosers. I tend to trust everyone until they show me that they can't be trusted, I've taken a few in the back but compaired to the number of close friends I've made.... it was worth it.  Well, that's my perspective anyway."
38126,Rich,2007-02-22 09:11:00,3927, Well said Cliff.
38138,aplumma,2007-02-22 11:49:00,6896,Dang no point in expressing my beliefs when Cliff has done such a nice job......but then it is what I expect from my close friend cliff. Well said bud and I hope it helps Lew see some prospective in his troubled time.  Art
38143,misfish,2007-02-22 11:57:00,29133,"To me I just call ya ""hey bud hows things"",everyone is ""bud"",or hey d.....k head, what you looking at, if yer not a ""bud"". Then theres the ones I call me ducky,thats just a bit better then a bud.  Friends are what you make them,best friend is someone like Cliff said,wife and kids,there til the end. I had a good friend,but seems to have taken a walk without a word.   If Igo fishing with someone here dosent mean yer my friend or fo,just a fishing companion for the day that gets the name bud,unless you piss me off then you get called d...k head. LOL   Anyhoo smile Lew,if theres one thing I have learned the last 6 months,ya cant sweat the petty stuff. What ever you do,dont pet the sweaty stuff. SMILE LEW."
38151,bpsbassman,2007-02-22 12:45:00,941,"Wow Cliff, I've never heard it said any better than that. Keep your chin up Lew.  Whoever is bothering you is not worth the time you're giving it. Move on and be thankful for all your casual, close and BEST friends. Take care bud."
38161,Deano,2007-02-22 13:11:00,767,"Man's best friend is dogs. I have two too bad people don't learn from them. Take it easy, Lew, life gives us trying times to appreciate the good times."
