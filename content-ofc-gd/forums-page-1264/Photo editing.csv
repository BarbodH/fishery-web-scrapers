36603,huey graphite,2007-02-20 00:28:00,362,I have one of my favorite fishing pics from the mid-1980's that I recently scanned but it is in Adobe Acrobat format. The quality is poor. I'd like to change the format and perhaps email it to a volunteer to try to improve the quality.  Any takers?

36616,bigfish1965,2007-02-20 00:52:00,3382,Change the output on your scanner to save it in .jpg format. I would guess you are using a Canon scanner and the included software?
36620,FishFinder,2007-02-20 01:08:00,481,"it is impossible to improve the quality of an image, its either your scanner, the output or the original picture itself."
36679,ccmtcanada,2007-02-20 02:44:00,7971,"When you scan it, try to do it at a higher resolution....maybe 3 or 4 times the original size.  Printing quality will be better and editing is easier when using large scans."
36684,Frankypro,2007-02-20 02:46:00,63,"If the quality of the original is good...there is hope.  rescan the snapshot using the best resolution your scanner has.  Should be a better scan and something you can then ""edit"" ie: enhance colours brighten etc.   The copy stores (the UPS and Mail Boxes etc.) have decent equipment to scan adn they can help you if your scanner just isn't working for you,  I don't think they would charge more than a few dollars.  Good luck, hopefully it's something you can share!"
36693,vanillagorilla,2007-02-20 02:54:00,46,I would suggest going to a Wal-Mart Photocenter as I have had a similar need to have an older picture scanned into digital.  You can either use a Kodak Picture Maker Kiosk yourself or ask a lab technician to use their lab scanner.  If your picture is poor quality to begin with then you are probably out of luck. I hope this helps.  Vanilla Gorilla
36807,huey graphite,2007-02-20 13:11:00,362,  I was able to change the output to a jpeg. Thanks for the suggestion.
38953,huey graphite,2007-02-23 17:46:00,362,Here is the pic I needed help with. Not a great pic by any standards. It's more the memory for me. I was about 15 years old and had just started Salmon fishing. I caught this in the Niagara Whirlpool around October of 1984 or '85.  It weighed 28lbs and measured 44 inches. It took about 40 minutes to land after several runs. Thrill of a lifetime.  Thanks again to Terry for editing the pic for me.
