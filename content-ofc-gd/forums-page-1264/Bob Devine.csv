38727,Bob Devine,2007-02-23 05:04:00,251,"For those who don't know Robert ""Bob"" Brunner you are missing a pioneer in the fishing industry. If he were Canadian he would be ""Red Fisher"". At 82 yrs young Bob is still guide on the US side of Lake St. Clair. Casting on Lake St. Clair no less. He has been inducted into the Fresh Water Hall of Fame and one great guy with a sense of humour. I am pleased to know this man and hope to share a boat with him this yr.  Glad to have you on board OFC,"
