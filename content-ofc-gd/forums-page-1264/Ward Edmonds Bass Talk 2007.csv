37771,David Chong,2007-02-21 22:27:00,836,"Bob, Everyone who was there took something away from it! Rookies, pros, intermediates & kids all learned something! Like I had said previously unless your name is Kevin Van Dam or Rick Clunn then this is a great opportunity for anyone who is remotely interested in bass fishing to go and better themselves. As an added bonus with Ward Edmonds hosting the event the lunch alone might be worth the $75.00! Cheers, Dave"

Should we give everyone that attends a free hat and how about the first 25 enrolments a GM cooler bag and a free Berkley Crankbait? Hmmmmmmmmmmmmmm just the fact it wont be a cheap lunch should should be enough but thought I would ask your opinion anyway. Let me know, Ward  Ward, that would be awesome! There will be all kinds of door prizes on top of what Ward has generously donated! And knowing Ward, I believe that the lunch itself will be worth the $75.00 never mind all the knowledge that you can obtain at this great event! This is WIN, WIN, WIN! Get your registrations in, remember the first 25 are already winners! For all those who don't have chequing accounts we will accept credit card payments both through fax or at Ward Edmonds GM!  Ward, thanks for all your support! Dave"
