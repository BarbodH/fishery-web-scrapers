The Computer Help Center was so very popular it now has its own forum rather than being a sub-forum to this one. Also we have placed a fishing announcements area as a new subforum. This is for announcments from fishing organizations and shows. We've yet to really set the parameters for that forum, so bear with us as we figure out how much to allow in there."
