38859,Big Cliff,2007-02-23 15:12:00,6899,Kudos to Bill's bait and Tackle!  No one prize or controbution may seem like a lot by itself but together........ Kind of like grains of sand; put enough of them together and you have one heck of a nice beach!  We have to remember to let all of the people that have supported us know that we really appreciate it!
