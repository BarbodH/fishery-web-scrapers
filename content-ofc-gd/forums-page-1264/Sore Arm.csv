38456,dsn,2007-02-22 22:17:00,1018,Interesting report. I was hoping as I was reading it hear what it was.   Pike? Laker? Carp? Piek I have never caught through the ice don't know what it feels like. Laker I have lost many this year I know what they do. Carp I have never caught in hardwater season but know what they can do in the summer. I wonder if they are slower fishters during the ice season.   dsn
38630,Master of Bait,2007-02-23 02:49:00,196,"DANG Clamp!  Good read, great report.  Too bad not to at least get a look at it!  Still fun I'm sure...  I'd be willing to bet it was a big northern too.  Seen pics of some huge ones coming out of Simcoe.  If I snag one with a hook in his mouth during my next trip I will dedicate it to you."
37764,Clampet,2007-02-21 22:21:00,1947,"Well, decided to head out today to a different spot. Got there around 10:45 AM, walked fer about 20 minutes, beautiful day, did not need to wear heavy clothing while walking just too warm.  I avoided setting up around a huge conglomeration of Ice Shanties.  Elected to stay away from the crowd.  Did not need Tarp today, very nice.  Made my first hole.  Tipped offering with a nice lively shiner. Caught a small Perch, and put it back down the hole.  There were some green weeds there.  Every now and then I would snag them and bring them up and throw them beside the hole.  After about 15 minutes decided to move about 20 paces. Caught another 3 Perch, then nothing for about 10 minutes.  Decided to move again about 40 paces. Drill the hole, use the scoop to remove the ice from hole.  Bait the lure, lower it to the bottom, crank a half turn on the reel handle to raise the lure slightly off bottom.....then......tick...I feel something, could be a weed, but I just hold the rod steady, neither pulling nor giving any slack.  Then I notice a slight pulling, very slowly.  I say to myself this is a fish.  I know from the way it is pulling it is not one of those dinky Perch.  So I pull very slowly and steadily upwards.  Now I get the full gist of what is happening.  It feels like a pail full of cement. There is a large fish on.  I am exited. Anyway I take my anti-reverse off my spinning reel, as I do not trust drags, especially in colder temps.  So for the next 15 minutes I am engaging this fish.  I pump it up about 5 feet, it pulls back, I back reel just enough to keep the line from parting, and keep enough tension so that the hook doesn't come out.  I tell ya, my arm was getting sore.  I tried to give it a break by holding the rod with my left hand but just for a few seconds.  What a fight.  This thing was heavy.  I could feel the weight when I pulled on it.  I don't think I had it foul hooked sideways, as I felt it bite initialy, suggesting I had it hooked in the mouth. So, I'm thinking, if I can get this thing up to the hole, will it fit? Visions of a gaff hook come to mind, but I don't have one.  I begin considering hollering to the nearby anglers fishing out of the rental huts, but dismiss that idea, as I don't want to be beholding to any strangers.  I start to think that this thing, whatever it is, prolly won't fit thru my 6 inch ice hole. But no time fer that, I am still reefing on this thing, and it it is pulling back too. So after about 15 minutes I notice that there is no longer any give.  I figure that the fish has reached the hole.  I try pulling, nope it is solid.  I try to give a bit of slack, but none is taken.  I figure the damn fish is crossways under the ice, so I reach fer one of my tarp poles un my sleigh.  I manage to get a pole loose from the velcro, and with one hand I hold the rod, and with the other I carefully push the pole down the hole.  I try swishing the pole around, trying to feel the fish.  But I feel nothing.  The line is angled (there's that word angle) down the hole and probably hooked to the edge of the hole, I reason cause there is no longer any pulling from the fish, and I cannot get the line to budge. I break it off after a few minute of trying, and pack everything up and begin the walk back to shore.  I make it to the car at 2:59 Pm. I landed a 19 lb Pike in the French River some time ago, and this fish that I lost today felt considerably heavier."
37783,Greencoachdog,2007-02-21 22:45:00,8163,I HATE IT when the big'un gets away!!!
37795,urbanangler1990,2007-02-21 23:04:00,933,"aww and the big one that got away, that sux."
37799,Bernie,2007-02-21 23:07:00,3190,Good post Clampet. Too bad the results didnt .   Gets your heart pumping though!
37824,Mike the Pike,2007-02-21 23:50:00,3421,"Paul once again I enjoyed that.I could just imagine the adrealine pumping today ,your heart must have been pumping fast.Now you need to add a gaff hook to your list of wants .I put tape on the end of mine when I want to release the fish.I am glad I bought the 8 inch Fin bore.I can always learn a little from you older guys.  MTP. I posted a few skunks but its nice to hear about the one that got away>>>>>>>>>>>>>"
37830,Bassman27,2007-02-21 23:58:00,98,Where were ya fishin today Clampet???Too bad you didn't get him.  Bassman
37838,Joey,2007-02-22 00:09:00,9122,"Well crap Paul, what a bummer.  You sure you didn't just have the side of the ice hooked and your drag loose  Joey"
37847,Greencoachdog,2007-02-22 00:17:00,8163,  Well that narrows it down ALOT!!!   I was thinkin' limber tree limb Joey.
37848,Rich Clemens,2007-02-22 00:18:00,3131,"Great report Clampet.  So today you were using the 'tarpis leftonsledus'.  Rest that arm buddy, you're sure to need it again one of these days."
37855,GbayGiant,2007-02-22 00:23:00,1780," Oh man, that's just wrong."
37861,Puckhead,2007-02-22 00:30:00,377, Big laker?  Or was it ........      Igopogo  
37873,bucktail,2007-02-22 00:48:00,1857,That sucks when you don't get a look at it!
37881,xrap,2007-02-22 00:53:00,683,"Man that sucks I know how you feel the same thing happened to me but not ice fishing. The crappie fishing was hot then it stopped for 10 mintues not a bite, then bang bobber went flying under and after a 10 mintue fight it broke off. We got a glimpse of it and it was also a pike. But hey, atleast you got a decent fight out of it. Nice report btw, It was exciting not like my plain report  went fishing caught this... haha lol"
37917,ccmtcanada,2007-02-22 01:27:00,7971,Awesome report Paul!! Wow...I felt the anticipation as I read it....and then felt your disappointment!
37946,Eddyk,2007-02-22 01:59:00,195,Paul. That was as exciting as reading the Old Man and The Sea. I enjoyed it. Thanks.
38112,steverowbotham,2007-02-22 05:31:00,1800,"There are some TANK pike down in Cook's Bay, wouldnt be surprised if you were tangling with a 20+ they are in there !"
38125,Rich,2007-02-22 08:56:00,3927,Too bad you lost that carp!
38130,Greencoachdog,2007-02-22 11:26:00,8163,"I still think it was a TROPHY tree branch!  One species that noone has mentioned it could have been is a Burbot, it's getting about that time of year for them to come in shallow and breed under the ice... but it was prolly an ol' ill tempered Pike or vicious Carp."
38192,glen,2007-02-22 14:24:00,2641,I liked the report Clampet.  I guess thats how big fish get bigger.  Go back down there and catch him.
38219,bassassin,2007-02-22 15:03:00,152,Thats why its key to set the hook!!!!
38235,fishnsled,2007-02-22 15:31:00,3520,One of the best reads I've seen here in a long time.    I could agree more.  Thanks for the report and better luck next time.  Fishnsled
38271,lovetofish,2007-02-22 16:22:00,500,nice report Clampet!  Too bad you couldn't at least get a look at it!  At least you got a good fight out of it.  Better luck next time!  lovetofish
38281,Guest mistyriver1,2007-02-22 16:36:00,0,Great read Clampet.  I was thinking the same as Rich.....Carp.  My son and I were out on Simcoe last year and we hooked a carp that we would have not got through a 10 inch hole.  We fought him for a bit and tried to get him to the hole for a pic but he snapped the line.
38283,tonyb,2007-02-22 16:48:00,1637,CARP!
38288,glen,2007-02-22 16:56:00,2641,clampet your camera takes small pics.
