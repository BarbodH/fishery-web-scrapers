37949,Gerritt,2007-02-22 02:02:00,6129,"How did I miss this post?!?? Sorry again about your daughter Lew, get her to wrap her ribs in Tensor bandages, they may be uncomfortable but they will help.  Gerritt."
37977,bigfish1965,2007-02-22 02:28:00,3382,"Dang..broken ribs suck. Can't cough, laugh or sneeze. Done it a few times. But any accident you walk away from is a not-so-bad event. Hope she is on the mend soon."
37979,Bly,2007-02-22 02:33:00,1556,Lew and Sheri..sorry to hear about all of this and I hope you recover quickly!
37985,Garyv,2007-02-22 02:36:00,547,"Lew...as long as the injuries can heal the outcome will have a happy ending.  The guy who cut her off could care less but he has to live with himself and some day he may regret being a jerk, however only time will tell."
37987,GbayGiant,2007-02-22 02:41:00,1780,"Keep us posted on how shes doing Lew, I'm sure she'll be 100% physically in no time. The mental issue of feeling safe on the roads in another thing.  Living on hwy #69 I've seen some bad things, it's a death trap, but they have been working on the new highway for some time, it's a slow process. Anything can happen I use to laugh at those moose signs you see up north, until my sister and her best friend hit one 4 years ago and were lucky to walk away with bumps and bruises, lost teeth, and a hoof print on her forehead."
38047,musky_man,2007-02-22 03:43:00,159,"Lew,   Sorry to hear the news.  Please give Sheri my best."
38140,canadian_copper,2007-02-22 11:55:00,925,STILL ALIVE IS THE MAIN THING!!! HOPE YOUR DAUGHTER HAS A SPEEDY RECOVERY (PERKS HELP  LOL)  IT NEVER SEEMS TO AMAZE ME HOW MANY PEOPLE GET HURT AT THE EXPENSE OF OTHERS AND ARE SUCH COWARDS TO RUN!!!  WHAT GOES AROUND COMES AROUND BRO!!! HE'LL GET HIS!!!
38773,Handlebarz,2007-02-23 11:48:00,3790,Dang Lew that realy sucks I hope she recovers fast what the hell are some people thinking about I see that crap out there everyday and just dont understand why they are acting that way. Wish Sherry the best from me and the family Lew.  Mike
38777,lew,2007-02-23 12:02:00,12767,"Thanks again everyone and Sheri also sends her thanks and certainly appreciates all your ""get well wishes""  It means alot to her......and me !!"
38848,caper,2007-02-23 14:59:00,210,That bites Lew. Sure makes it harder to get over it when your crawling around in pain.. All the best to her.. If there's anything I can do from my end just let me know..Craig
37114,lew,2007-02-20 23:18:00,12767,"I posted the other day about some punk forcing my daughter off the road and into the guardrail.  She has a broken hand and alot of scrapes, swelling and bruising, but she's also been having severe pains in her back, so she went back to the hospital today for more testing and X-rays, and this time it shows she also has a couple broken ribs that didn't show up before because of the swelling.  She just called to tell us, but the trouble is, there isn't too much they can do for her, so that's just one more thing she has to suffer thru.  I hope that punk finds himself in a car crash one of these days !!"
37120,camillj,2007-02-20 23:26:00,1988,"Sorry to hear Lew, hope Sheri has a speedy recovery.  As for the punk, well, things have a way of taking care of themselves ..."
37126,Daplumma,2007-02-20 23:31:00,1961,"Broken ribs are no fun Lew,I broke a couple boxing in the Navy.Not much they can do for them.I'd like to spend a few minutes alone with the punk,he would find out just how a few broken ribs feel. Joe"
37155,tjsa,2007-02-20 23:54:00,1578,"Sorry to hear that Lew, but she will get better. She will need time to rest for sure. I tried to break a couple of ribs almost a month ago(don't ask) and I am still feeling it."
37158,bigbuck,2007-02-20 23:56:00,2449,"He'll get his Lew, what comes around goes around. I feel for your daughter, the road to recovery just became a bit longer and more difficult but thank god, she'll heal, she's still around."
37165,lunkerbasshunter,2007-02-21 00:01:00,2585,hey lew that sucks!  Hope she can recover quickly and with as little pain as possible!  As for the punk that did it.  try to be at ease with the fact that what goes around comes around!
37514,lew,2007-02-21 16:30:00,12767,I'm just bumping this up because I'm receiving alot of PM's from friends asking for any update on Sheri.  Thanks folks !!
37516,ccmtcanada,2007-02-21 16:32:00,7971,Lew...just read the update on the ribs...OUCH!  It was nice to hear from her on the other thread.  I hope she mends quickly.  As for the other driver...well...I think it's all been said.
37528,snag,2007-02-21 16:42:00,1932,Unbelievable.  Still glad she's O.k
37553,Cookslav,2007-02-21 17:17:00,1457,"Man that sucks,  I've been there and its no fun. I hope the docs gave her some good Pain killers...  Hard to sleep with the pain yet the best releif is to slow your breathing and relax... I reeeeley feel for her.  I found a body wrap compress hurts at first but once I got used to it...it was my savour. I wish her a speedy recovery"
37558,Squid,2007-02-21 17:22:00,1656, Wow that sucks Lew. Wish Sheri the best for me.
37561,Spiel,2007-02-21 17:35:00,9065,....I can certainly understand your frustrations Lew but fortunately Sheri's injuries will heal in time. It's truly sad though that she has to go through this because of the inconsiderate actions of another!
37632,JPD,2007-02-21 20:04:00,296,Wish her all the best Lew and a speedy recovery. They (broken ribs) are no fun but luckily mend themselves.  Short breaths will help ease the discomfort.  JP
37636,Joey,2007-02-21 20:11:00,9122,"Lew, I broke my ribs in a car accident once, hurt like heck.  Tell Sheri I sympathize and hope she feels better soon.  Joey"
37639,JFR,2007-02-21 20:15:00,498,"Sorry to hear about the additional injurie to Sheri, Lew.  You know Lew, the rectums get what is coming to them eventually, they don't fly under the radar for very long  I hope she feels better soon   John"
37645,Crazyhook,2007-02-21 20:21:00,1154,"thats aweful Lew, I hope she gets better really soon. Ribs take a long while to heal"
37665,Guest mistyriver1,2007-02-21 20:38:00,0,"Lew, I just saw this now.  I hope Sheri is taking some time off work to heal.  Tell her Sue, Corey, Ben and I are thinking of her.  Jim"
37780,irishfield,2007-02-21 22:41:00,26272,"Life's full of curves for sure Lew and we both know that all tooooo well unfortunately. I know that her father will seek the utmost care for her and Sheri will recover fully in due time.  As for the ""point and swerve"", he'll/she'll get theirs sooner or later. Just hopefully they don't kill anyone in the mean time."
37796,Woodsman,2007-02-21 23:04:00,1286,"Lew: Sorry to here the bad news. My best wishes for a quick recovery for your daughter. Sometimes with broken ribs, it's not the ribs but the pulled & torn muscles that take the longest to heal. Get well soon Sheri.  Best Wishes: Rick"
37802,Greencoachdog,2007-02-21 23:16:00,8163,"This whole ordeal is just terrible, not only for your daughter but for the whole family. Have y'all considered an MRI to make sure there are no other injuries? I wish her a speedy recovery and everyone else peace of mind.  The little snot nosed punk will get his one day, karma has a way of catching up."
37806,OhioFisherman,2007-02-21 23:18:00,6623,"I hope Sheri gets to feeling better! Never broke any ribs myself, but pulled some muscles in them, nothing like a jab with each deep breath. Always sad to see that stuff happen Lew, a changing society."
37816,1leggedangler,2007-02-21 23:36:00,364,"Man that sucks, I know how sore broken ribs can be. Hope Sheri is pain free sooner than later. As for buddy with no regard for safety life has a funny way of evening things out and he'll get his just dues!"
37885,Smokey,2007-02-22 00:58:00,1278,"Wish Sheri all the best Lew. I hope she has a speedy recovery, broken ribs can be one of the toughest injuries to get over. She had better get over it and ready for muskie opener with you."
37928,Eddyk,2007-02-22 01:38:00,195,"Sheri, you will have to come down to the Rideau lakes this summer and ill take you canoeing for bass. It,s a much slower life style. From what Ive seen nobody drives over 25 Km. an hour no matter what the speed limit is. It,s going to take me a while to slow down to their life style. It will be a great place for you to unwind."
37947,DT10Sam,2007-02-22 02:00:00,480,"Hi Lew,  Hope that Sheri is coming along well and she will heal quickly being a young lady it seems they heal alot quicker than young men do.  As for the punk that run her off the road I know a good taxidermist that can take care of him and just let me know what pose you would like him in  .  Best regards, Sam"
