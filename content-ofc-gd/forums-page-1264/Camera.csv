So on my trip to Florida the first day we open up the camera bag to take some picturesand come to realize that the camera has lost its focus mechanism, I just used it 3 days before. So it's Sunday late evening and I think the only thing open will be Wally World so off I go. On the way I pass a Sony store and the open sign is still on, can't be, I check the clock 9:37 pm. I pull in it's open. Out I come with the Sony Cybershot DSC-H5. 7.2 megapixel  12 times optical zoom and a 3 inch screen.  I love the new camera, What do you guys that know cameras think of this model. I'm pretty sure I paid a lot more than I could have got it for here in Canada but I needed one NOW. On a side note because I am a Canadian and bought it in the US I can't purchase the extended warranty. I am going to have a discussion about this with Sony.   Part 2 My old camera was an HP photosmart 945, it was a pretty good camera. It is 5.3 megapixel and either  7 or 8 times optical zoom (can't remember). I contacted several repair facilities and by far the best seems to be dealing directly with HP. They want $200 including the cast of shipping to them and back for the repair. My question is should I get it repaired. I know I can buy a 5 megapixel camera for about $200 but not with that much zoom (I don't think). I thought it might be worth it and keep this as my boat camera."

38311,Headhunter,2007-02-22 17:27:00,5703,"Jsut a suggestion re the HP camera. Have you tried removing the batteries and letting it sit for about 1/2 an hour, then reloading the batteries and starting up? It should then default to brand new/initial status. I had a similar problem with my Nikon point and shoot, called Nikon and that was their suggestion... and it worked. Hope this helps? HH"

I forgot to mention in my post that I specifically asked the salesman about warranty and he said it was North America wide. Talking to Sony they will honor the original 1 year here in Canada but will not allow the purchase of the extended warranty. Just doesn't make a lot of sense.  Also thanks for the tip Headhunter I tried it last night , unfortunately it didn't fix it. It was worth a shot."
