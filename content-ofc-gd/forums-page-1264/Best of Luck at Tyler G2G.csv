I would like to extend my best wishes to everyone that is attending the tourney. I know that there has been an extremely tremendous amount of work gone into the organization of the event and I am confident that it will again be a great success.  I am also anxious to see who will de-throne Terry this year with the biggest fish.  Best of luck to all and I will be waiting for the results.  Kind regards, Sam and Laurie"
