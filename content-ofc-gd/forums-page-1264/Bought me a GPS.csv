38697,douG,2007-02-23 03:56:00,2693,I hate that when that happens.
38699,irishfield,2007-02-23 04:00:00,26272,Will be easier than searching for their tobogan tracks again....
38705,Nemo,2007-02-23 04:07:00,727,Congrats nice GPS  
38709,icefisherman,2007-02-23 04:14:00,952,"Congrats on the new toy Doug. No more fog problems for you ;-) And color screen with lots of memory...now get the Blue charts for it and you are all set.  Cheers, Ice Fisherman"
38729,Joey,2007-02-23 05:06:00,9122,"So that other deal didn't work out for ya DouG?  Nice unit you got tho.  Now if someone ""tells ya where to go"" you'll be able to find your way there faster  Joey"
38767,motv8tr,2007-02-23 11:31:00,2587,"Looks good Doug, one of these days I'm gonna get me one of those....maybe when I get my boat  Maureen"
38771,Big Cliff,2007-02-23 11:38:00,6899,"Excellent unit, now spend a bit of time learning how to use it before you go off somewhere and get lost and HAVE to find your way back LOL."
38775,aplumma,2007-02-23 11:55:00,6896,I once went into the woods with my labrador and to make sure I could get home I left a trail of crumbs. I got 2 things from that trip 1 is lost and 2 a very fat labrador. Good to hear you got a GPS I have one in the car and another on the boat they are invaluable. One piece of advise is always set a start point in the GPS before you go into the woods that way if your batteries are getting low you can turn it off which erases your path but still have a return point when you turn it back on.

38801,Raf,2007-02-23 13:23:00,3495,"congrats douG, you'll lvoe that unit."
38803,Deano,2007-02-23 13:32:00,767,"Congrats, that's a great unit, you may have thought it expensive now, but in a couple of weeks you'll be thinking ""how did I ever go without"". It is an awesome tool which will give you so much freedom, things that limited you before are gone. Piece of mind and the freedom to just explore. I would recomend getting the Topo Canada maps also, they can autoroute you to most places and show most island, rivers and trails. The GPS is gonna revolutionize the world like the lightbulb and computers."
38879,tonyb,2007-02-23 15:30:00,1637,That's a pretty good deal with the 1GB card.  Thanks for sharing the info...now I just need to get the funds together.  I think 2 bluecharts would add about another $400 to the purchase  Tony
38917,POLLIWOGG,2007-02-23 17:01:00,835,"I was at a district meeting of the Canadian Power Squadron a few weeks ago and it was reported that 50% of those that take our GPS coarse fail the exam. The gps coarse is starting to get requested more often but our squadron hasn't done one yet and I haven't seen it.  I would guess that at least 90% of those that have gps don't know how to use all of the features of the unit.  I'm one of that 90%, I use a cheep gps and link it to a laptop, everything is done on the laptop and all I know about the gps is how to turn it on and off. One of these days I'll dig up the manuel and figure it out."
38999,douG,2007-02-23 19:14:00,2693,"I've had a few pms asking where I bought it.  It's http://www.gpscity.ca/.  If you are thinking about buying a gps, give these folks in Alberta a look.  Order online or call 1-800-957-3454 Monday - Friday 9:00AM - 5:30PM MT"
