37604,snag,2007-02-21 19:02:00,1932," Oh heck,  I just saw that it is for the weekend.  If you are available Mon.-Fri. let me know."
37605,Crazyhook,2007-02-21 19:03:00,1154,working on getting there Thursday night so I will be good to go on Friday...
37611,snag,2007-02-21 19:25:00,1932, It's a date!  Bring the fly rods  I'll bring extra gear for you too.  Ashbridges bay could be good too (5 min. from beaches)
37612,BFSC Kevin,2007-02-21 19:30:00,1351,fly fishing at ashbridges.. really? i cant really imagine where...that'd be interesting.
37613,snag,2007-02-21 19:35:00,1932, Check this out:  PIKE ON THE FLY  I love experimenting........
37614,lew,2007-02-21 19:35:00,12767,I'm 15 minutes from Ashbridges Bay.....count me in.
37615,Crazyhook,2007-02-21 19:36:00,1154,I will bring a bulldawg for you Lew!! Lew you still coming to Ottawa this weekend?
37616,Crazyhook,2007-02-21 19:37:00,1154,"I will br bringing 2 fly rods if someone wants to throw a fly around. Have some big fly's from Europe coming oer, hope I get them in time!"
37617,MJL,2007-02-21 19:40:00,2427,"You can always try fly fishing the islands for pike.  Ample room for back casts in a lot of the places and if it gets windy, you can move to another sheltered canal.  The problem with fly fishing around Toronto is the pedestrian traffic although in March, I'd imagine it would be lighter than in summer.  The spit is another option - Kilometers of shoreline to fish and open if you have waders.  Humber for steelhead and suckers is another option."
37618,MJL,2007-02-21 19:42:00,2427,Double post
37620,lew,2007-02-21 19:44:00,12767," Bulldawgs on a flyrod....perfect !!  We'll be arriving about 5:00 Friday afternoon Jamie, are you guys in for supper Saturday night ??"
37621,BFSC Kevin,2007-02-21 19:46:00,1351,"hey lew, whereabouts are you? im at jones and gerrard."
37623,Headhunter,2007-02-21 19:51:00,5703,"Hey Kevin, I'm at Dundas and Greenwood, puts me close to you and Lew! Sounds like the beginnings of a GTG! Perhaps we could bring this topic up again, as we get closer? Wouldn't mind hooking up if I can get away for a few hours. HH"
37624,Crazyhook,2007-02-21 19:51:00,1154,can't do dinner... have one of the little ones friends B day party's to go to ( and it starts!..) I hope I can come out and at least say hello and have a drink with you guys   The Humber eh... I am opretty new to fly fishing.. that may be an option as well
37629,BFSC Kevin,2007-02-21 19:57:00,1351,"yeah, maybe when we get closer to the time we should bring this topic back up. i never tried fly fishing before, never touched a fly rod in my life. Usually when i stay to fish in toronto, i go down to the spits, and conviently, now they are opening a CTC there. awesome! do you guys know when it's opening?"
37631,Crazyhook,2007-02-21 20:03:00,1154,have no idea what the spits are
37647,urbanangler1990,2007-02-21 20:22:00,933,"  spits r at the south end of leslie street, i believe..."
37659,MJL,2007-02-21 20:34:00,2427," The spit is a piece of land that juts out into lake Ontario.  Pack light because it's a long hike end to end.  Better yet, hire DSN for the day as that's around his home turf.  He accepts donuts and cookies as payment for a half a day trip and dinner for a full days guiding...Of which I have yet to pay for last seasons adventures..."
37663,BFSC Kevin,2007-02-21 20:38:00,1351,"yup, quite a walk from the entrance, probably around a 20 min walk but i normally rollerblade or bike there."
37679,Headhunter,2007-02-21 20:51:00,5703,"I believe it's around 10 k to the Lighthouse and back. There are numerous places to fish along the various shore lines, most however would require waders/tubes or a boat to get out to fishable waters. HH"
37960,majorlifts,2007-02-22 02:13:00,171,"The Humber sound good. Dude!! I just scored a new fly jacket today at the second hand store with the tags still on it $12 bucks. I love fly fishing, only I would be looking for a quiet little corner away from all the hustle and bustle of the city."
39154,Rodel Misa,2007-02-23 23:05:00,6,Hey Crazyhook.. a lot good tribs within 30 minutes. I usually start for steelies in march. pm and we can hook up ...I'm just north of the beaches.. Rodel  ps. Do you have access to RD spinner baits? running low.
