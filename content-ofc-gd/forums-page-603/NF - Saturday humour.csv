The woman perks up and says, ""How about that? I just ordered a glass of champagne, too!"" He turned to her and said, ""What a coincidence. This is a special day for me; I'm celebrating."" ""This is a special day for me, too, and I'm also celebrating!,"" says the woman. ""What a coincidence,"" says the man. They clinked glasses and he asked, ""What are you celebrating?"" ""My husband and I have been trying to have a child,"" she replied. ""Today, my gynaecologist told me I'm pregnant!"" ""What a coincidence,"" says the man. ""I'm a chicken farmer. For years all my hens were infertile, but today they're finally fertile."" ""That's great!"" says the woman, ""how did your chickens become fertile?"" ""I switched cocks,"" he replied. ""What a coincidence,"" she said."
