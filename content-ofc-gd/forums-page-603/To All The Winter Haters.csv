526658,Dave Bailey,2010-12-09 01:29:00,1641,"I don't begrudge anyone having fun in the winter, but some of us have very good reasons for disliking it. Thanks to a run in with some bad water back around 1972 I have irritable bowel syndrome, and one of the many things that sets it off is my abdomen getting cold. I take Imodium like Smarties to keep some semblance of normality in my life, but it doesn't always help.  But one of these days I may actually go ice fishing. I always used to think that it was nothing but beer, dirty jokes, and flatulence, but then it struck me - what's the downside of that?!"
527029,skeeter,2010-12-10 03:36:00,1907,"so the skeeter is the one getting wacked off! and this is a bad thing, how ???"
527030,mercman,2010-12-10 03:48:00,7054,"good point Speaking of wacked off,spent the morning with the wife at the IVF clinic.You shoulda seen all these guys in the waiting room looking like deer in a head light Hillarious. One would get up and leave, back in 5. This one guy, a big dude, was gone for 20 minutes.He was having a 'hard' time until the doctor told him of the alternate method of collection Something like a cattle prod and large sharp needle"
527034,skeeter,2010-12-10 03:57:00,1907, cattle prod & needle

527087,Pikeslayer,2010-12-10 13:45:00,1443," Hey Mercman, I think this scene from the movie 'Road Trip' is very fitting http://www.youtube.c...h?v=AZ93JG4xiwQ and could make your 'job' a lot easier  Regards, Pikeslayer"
527141,mercman,2010-12-10 16:38:00,7054,"  only problem is the nurses at THIS clinic looked like they came from Jurasic park, if you get my drift"
527185,Twocoda,2010-12-10 18:20:00,4130,  oh that red head from the movie was smokin hot!!! your lucky dude  i wonder if it would be rude to ask for a hand
