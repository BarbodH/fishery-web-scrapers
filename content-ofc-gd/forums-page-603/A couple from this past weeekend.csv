It was the first trip back for MJL since his surgery, and let me say... he's still got it! He managed to pull off something that can never be mentioned I was devastated... but eventually landed a fresh chrome hen and a bonus brown with a monster kype.  Victor schooled us both with his secret super power that he can keep to himself LOL   "

526432,Roy,2010-12-08 13:48:00,13728,"Great report and beauty fish. Y'know, I really regret not having met guys like you when I was younger....just to learn some of the finer points of fishing. I don't know if I would have been able to keep up with the $$$ aspect of it all though. Anyhow, thanks for sharing that with us."
