About a month ago I noticed he had all kinds of empty brake fluid containers in his garage, him being a mechanic it struck me as no big deal...but then the other day as I dropped in unexpectedly, I caught him talking a drink of brake fluid!!!  I didn't know what to think about it so I just brushed it off the first time. He became a little more casual with his problem and when I caught him several times doing this, I finally approached him and said that this is a REAL problem that he needs help.  All he said to me was...  Don't worry I can stop at any time.              "
