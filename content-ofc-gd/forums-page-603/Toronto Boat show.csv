Find your ideal boat -- and everything to go with it -- at Canada's largest and most popular marine marketplace January 8 to 16, 2011, at the Direct Energy Centre, Exhibition Place.  Celebrating 53 years as the best place to see and buy boats, Canada's premiere boat show boasts more than 1,200 boats and hundreds of booths showcasing the latest in engines, electronics, marine gifts and accessories.  The Great Canadian Fish Tank is a must-see for both experienced and novice anglers. A 40-foot long aquarium filled with 5,000 gallons of water and stocked with native Ontario marine life, it is a unique teaching tool for pros to share their tips with anglers of all ages. The Great Canadian Fish Tank literally provides the fish-eye's view of how fish react to different lures and techniques.  This year's line-up of Fish Tank speakers and topics presents a wide range of tips and tricks for perfecting techniques on waters near and far (see TorontoBoatShow.com for dates and times):   Elsewhere at the show you'll find the latest products and services to enhance your fishing experience - boats, engines, electronics and navigation instruments, fishing tackle, foul weather gear, insurance, and more.  When you find that ideal new boat, be sure to take proof of your purchase to the Show Office to enter the ""Buy a Boat & Win"" contest. The lucky winner of a random draw will receive $10,000 towards the purchase of his or her boat, courtesy of Skippers' Plan, Robertson & Robertson Yacht Insurance.  One lucky winner at this year's show will also take home a $29,000 Princecraft Sport 164!  The Sport 164 is powered by a Mercury 75ELPT EFI four-stroke outboard engine and comes complete with a custom-painted, black bunk-style trailer. The bow area showcases an electric-fill aerated SportFloTM livewell 39L with overflow, thru-hull drain, anti-spill cover and insulated lid. The helm console features an optional Lowrance X-50 DS fish/depth finder on a swivelling bracket. Other features include a Motorguide W55 wireless 54-inch 12V trolling motor, two fold-down jump seats in the stern that convert to a casting deck, a trailer cover, coaming pads at the bow, a stern boarding ladder, and a removable deck insert that easily converts the bow from a casting deck into a V-Berth seating area.  For details on the Princecraft Prize Package, listen to Newstalk 1010. Entry forms will be available in the Toronto Star and at boat show entrances, where ballots can also be dropped off. The prize boat will be on display in Galleria Lobby, outside Hall A.  When you are ready to take a break from shopping and browsing the hundreds of exhibitor displays at this year's show, Henry's Fish House is a great rendezvous point for you and your friends. Here you can enjoy Henry's freshly prepared, world-famous fish dishes. A favourite destination for thousands of boaters looking for a taste of summer, Henry's permanent location is on an island in Georgian Bay, open only in summer with access by boat or seaplane. With its licensed bar featuring Muskoka Brewery, vibrant atmosphere, plenty of seating, and great food, Henry's is always a popular destination at the Toronto Boat Show.  If you haven't yet acquired your Pleasure Craft Operator Card (PCOC), before leaving the show, be sure to pick up information on educational programs to help gain the knowledge needed to write the PCOC test, or you can actually write the test at the Toronto Boat Show to earn your card. In 2009 it became law that ALL operators of power-driven pleasure craft must carry proof of competency onboard at all times; a PCOC is considered proof of competency, and is good for life.  Mark your calendar now, and go online to get advance tickets at a discount rate (kids 16 and under are free when accompanied by an adult; and special ticket prices are available for repeat visitors).
