527173,irishfield,2010-12-10 18:06:00,26272,A rendition on last years holders... I lost one somewhere on Kokoko last year and unfortunately didn't have another shoe rack around to destroy.. but I did still have a few cut offs from it.. welded them to some velco attach coat hangers and ....   
527184,Jds63,2010-12-10 18:19:00,1365,"very functional piece of work, there !  just picked up the Clam Base Camp Thermal today and set it up in the basement in 60 seconds, hope it goes that easy on the ice, then i'll need some of those rod holders to ... LOL"
527189,Terry,2010-12-10 18:38:00,14456,I guess I need to get my things ready to go soon too  first thing I need is a new battery for my ski-doo..they are not cheap..and I see they don't sell batteries by the pound
527217,kickingfrog,2010-12-10 20:02:00,8333," It is a good thing they don't. Watch batteries are $10 and the price would go UP from there, not down from car battery price. The consumer always gets it in the end."
527221,irishfield,2010-12-10 20:12:00,26272,  You didn't charge it or some myth like that over the summer did you?? I parked mine after our last trip and hit the key yesterday !! Fired right up...
527222,asdve23rveavwa,2010-12-10 20:14:00,2690,"Nice, Wayne!!!  Think I'm going to set up the hut in the backyard this weekend, fire up the heater, see if everything is ready to go.  Maybe I'll dig a hole in the ground"

527231,irishfield,2010-12-10 21:04:00,26272,I'll still be in the city on Saturday Lloyd.. probably Sunday as well as we have to wait for the VON Nurse to come by and give Jen her anti-infection needle before coming home with her. We don't know yet if that happens Sat or Sunday... has to be 24 hrs after chemo ends. Hopefully we can plan something for between Christmas and New Years for that lake over yonder! Next Chemo is the 3rd..

527245,camillj,2010-12-10 21:33:00,1988,"NIce Wayne ... I normally use my old faithfuls (inside or out) from a 30"" piece of welding rod with a ribberized pinch clip off a Zellers skirt holder hanger with a little bell on the tip to wake me up if I happen to nod off  it wiggles just BEFORE the strike as the minnow tries to avoid being eaten"
527249,irishfield,2010-12-10 21:37:00,26272,With the rod just resting there balanced Jon.. it allows the fish to pull the line down with minimal effort and if you're paying attention you can grab the rod and set the hook vs the static holders that swing out on the hut where the fish hits.. feels the tension and lets go without you even seeing it.
527282,Leecher,2010-12-10 23:43:00,7832,That'll work    Great job Wayne Now you just need to get a patten for it Jacques
527294,Fang,2010-12-11 00:10:00,1330,"don't know why the bother, there's no fish in Temagami!!!"
527298,irishfield,2010-12-11 00:17:00,26272,You've got that right Paul ! ... and you even put me on to some of those fishless spots!!
527361,fishhunter,2010-12-11 02:25:00,604,everyone knows no fish in Temagami. I dont know who ever started that thing about that lake having any fish  :whistling:
527368,lunkerbasshunter,2010-12-11 02:51:00,2585,wow great little set up there!  cheers!
527369,misfish,2010-12-11 02:52:00,29133,I would say yer fishing small game. Like how strong is yer velcro?  Can I give s bit of input to this bud?
527370,irishfield,2010-12-11 02:56:00,26272,That 2 inch wide velcro isn't going anywhere Brian... it only has to balance a rod.. you're supposed to grab it when they bite! lol
527376,bigugli,2010-12-11 03:13:00,6138,"In the words of Hannibal ""Don't you just love when a plan comes together?""  It's fun to tinker. Even better when an idea becomes reality. Well done."
527379,misfish,2010-12-11 03:22:00,29133,"   OK, since you asked so nice and all.  You did a great job on the fabrication of yer rod holder bud. Now if you drilled a hole in the tube and made your holder a ,slip inside the hole and turn and clinch,you wouldnt need the velcrow and it would be a more sturdy holder. Just say,n."
