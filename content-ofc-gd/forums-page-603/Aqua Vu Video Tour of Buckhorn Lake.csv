527526,pooch,2010-12-11 21:58:00,139,"Thanks for the positive feedback guys. I was using an Aqua Vu MAV unit, worked great all year.   I still can't believe how many fish I don't catch, but they are right beneath the boat. It can be frustrating at times, but hopefully with some more practice I'll get a few more hook-ups.  Cheers, Andrew"
