527010,Rod Caster,2010-12-10 02:33:00,5784,awwww I've never seen a grown man hug a steelhead before.  Nice fish...I'd embrace it as well.
527056,steelie hunter,2010-12-10 06:02:00,55,"I enjoy reading your threads, as I love steelheading myself, and glad you're also releasing your fish, something that is too rare these days, but perhaps try holding the fish better? Holding them like that, as well as laying them on the bank out of the water does a lot of harm to their slime coating, as well as just being out of the water longer. Just a thought, not trying to engage in anything. Keep the reports coming though buddy."

527069,spincast,2010-12-10 10:00:00,3279,"so did you ""curl"" him back to the hole in the ice to release? Nice fish."
