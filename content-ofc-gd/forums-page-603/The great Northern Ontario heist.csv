527334,limeyangler,2010-12-11 01:28:00,5204,"his was on a local news site today   Someone in Dryden managed to steal 63-cases of Labatt's beer from a Transport parked at Husky early Wednesday morning. City Police say the driver stopped for a rest and the culprits walked away with 22-hundred dollars worth of beer. The suspects walked the beer roughly 2-kilometres before driving off on a snowmachine. The culprits left behind one case of suds on the trail. Police say entry was gained by cutting the lock. Officers also located a box containing a fax machine, which was reported stolen from a military transport the same night. Anyone with information is asked to contact Dryden Police or Crimestoppers.   Someone is gonna be having a very 'merry' xmas"
527339,mercman,2010-12-11 01:34:00,7054,"lets see.....63 cases of beer and a fax machine.......Back in the ole days, i could""ve had a lot of fun with that kinda thing."
527340,irishfield,2010-12-11 01:34:00,26272,"That's a lot of ""portaging"".. hope if it was one person that they had a heart attack later and died from the 240KM of walking. Can't stand a thief.. no matter the bounty..  ..also can't see them carrying that many cases 2km.."
527343,kickingfrog,2010-12-11 01:36:00,8333, In the snow no less. There may be another shoe to drop.
527348,limeyangler,2010-12-11 01:49:00,5204,They actually did a search of a property here and found the beer.  But carrying that amount of beer 2 kms is hard to fathom.
527349,BUSTER,2010-12-11 01:52:00,1336,Inside job.
527352,Handlebarz,2010-12-11 01:54:00,3790,Bob and Doug
527359,Nipfisher,2010-12-11 02:18:00,2449, Bet you they were wearing toques and ear-muffs.Hosers!
527382,skeeter,2010-12-11 03:55:00,1907,63 cases of beer on a snowmachine????????
527387,ctranter,2010-12-11 04:03:00,543,Round them parts the fax machine is worth as much as the beer.  Word is the internet is coming through in '15
527389,mercman,2010-12-11 04:07:00,7054,  and a fax machine !!! Ya Baby!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
527394,Joey,2010-12-11 04:47:00,9122,Now that's something I'd like to see  A roo koo koo!!
527417,IndySKS,2010-12-11 13:28:00,134,Hold on folks your ready too much modern day stuff into this.This is Dryden......snow machine more than likely means dog sled in their language. 63 cases could be doable
527420,mercman,2010-12-11 13:40:00,7054,"it musta been a magical site to see. If they each carried 3 cases, that would have been 21 people trudging through the snow loaded with Labatts, followed by a guy with a fax machine.All following a bright star shining in the sky. How Christmasy is that !!!!"
527423,solopaddler,2010-12-11 13:56:00,8605,  I would like to know how they pulled that off.
527426,mercman,2010-12-11 14:04:00,7054,it was divine intervention
527427,Roy,2010-12-11 14:07:00,13728,That's like 1500 lbs of beer. I wonder if they show that much dedication at their jobs.
527429,Spiel,2010-12-11 14:10:00,9065,"  Perhaps that is their job Roy. At $25.00 a case, nothing but profit.  "
527430,bigugli,2010-12-11 14:11:00,6138,"25 years back,before GPS and satellite tracking, entire trailer loads of smokes and beer would go missing in and around the GTA. There were a number of stores just around the Yonge st. strip that had a line on cheap smokes and beer for their ""regulars"". Usually became available a couple of weeks after the latest hijacking 63 cases just would not seem to be worth the effort and risk"
527448,grt1,2010-12-11 16:08:00,638,"If you read the article it says the fax machine was stolen from a MILITARY truck, obviously the theft of the beer was just to throw the cops off the real target, the fax.  it was probably one of our militarys top secret weapons and had great monetary value on the black market, but having just spent 3 days in dryden, waiting out the snow storm courtesy of an alberta clipper, it would have to be a white market."
