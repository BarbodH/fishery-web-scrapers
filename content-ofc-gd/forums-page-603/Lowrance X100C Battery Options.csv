Anyways, my question is, which is my best/lightest battery option for it?  I could get one of the little lawn and garden tractor batteries, but, even they weigh quite a bit for their size.  I'm lugging everything on the ice (no sled or atv) so weight is a factor.  Any suggestions, would be appreciated!"

527171,skeeter,2010-12-10 18:05:00,1907,princess auto has gell batteries that are perfect for that.  http://www.princessauto.com/trailer/truck/truck-accessories/truck-electrical/8224834-sealed-12v-dc-rechargeable-battery
527174,asdve23rveavwa,2010-12-10 18:07:00,2690,Sweet!  Thanks guys!!  Much better option than lugging the other one out.
527181,irishfield,2010-12-10 18:16:00,26272,Skeeter.. that is one thing I will never buy from PA.. they are always old removed stock bought surplus and usually pretty much toast. For the same money you can get them on ebay including postage or walk into your local alarm place or the battery store in Barrie
