527671,Tom McCutcheon,2010-12-12 03:47:00,627,I'm waiting for his reply. When I talked to him earlier this week he was planning on hitting Rice today. (2 to 2-1/2 inches) The mild weather may have changed his plans. If you know the lake and use caution by spudding your way out it is fishable.  There is about 5 inches on the bay where I live and the kids are playing hockey already.  Tom
527729,Harrison,2010-12-12 15:07:00,2202,I was thinking of going today as well to Rice but the temps the last couple days and with the rain last night and this morning I have other thoughts...... to the Riva.
527753,Ron,2010-12-12 15:58:00,1683,"I was gonna go out, but decided on getting the outside choirs done around the house in anticipation of winter. (Ya I know, winter is here already). Ended up putting the boat to rest, (easily get out in hopes of fishing the Niagara this year). Ice hut out, gear tuned up, Muskie and spinning rods put away. There is over 5 inches of ice in some areas and then there is as little as 2 in others. Next weekend will mark the start of my Ice fishing season.  Cheers, Ron..."
