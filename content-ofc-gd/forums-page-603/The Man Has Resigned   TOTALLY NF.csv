527002,irishfield,2010-12-10 02:16:00,26272,Did you catch Dean on the crossbow killer G ???
527005,Gerritt,2010-12-10 02:21:00,6129,you mean the crossbro killing? you know as gang bangers do!
527007,irishfield,2010-12-10 02:23:00,26272,"Never bring a sheet to a bow fight...  Damn near pissed my pants while driving down Black Creek drive last Friday am... unfortunate at the expense of a dead father bowed down at the library, but it was hillarious although bordering on over the edge.."
527094,Flappn,2010-12-10 14:16:00,245,"It seems your either a Fan or not and no in between....none the less even my in-laws criticized my paid Satelite service...guess who now has a life time subscription to Serius.....the in-laws...they can't get enough of the old tunes with no commercials. Plus when we are up north we have perfect clear radio on land or in the boat.  There must be a reason they have 20 Million subscribers. When stern started 5 years ago they had 600,000."
527098,solopaddler,2010-12-10 14:34:00,8605,My camp is off the grid that's what I use Sirius for.
527146,jjcanoe,2010-12-10 16:51:00,744,"if you just listen for the pornstars etc..... real interviews in the last Month or so that I can remember... Billy Joel, Jayzee, David Arquette, Sandra Burnhard, Adam Carolla, Chris Rock, Tracy Morgan, Mike Sorrentino, Ozzy Ozbourne, Dr. Drew, Al Roker, Gilbert Gottfried, Paul Giamotti. Now, I haven't seen any porn from any of these  (mostly) A-list celebs.  The guests are similar to the line-up Letterman, Kimmel, Conan, Larry King, Oprah, The View, etc would have except there aren't the same recycled questions over and over. Here part of the Billy Joel interview. worth every penny I pay for my subscription Billy Joel http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dxw1WV_qmVk George Takai was a special guest all week in Studio. Priceless!!   He's got to.... Even Al Bundy had cable TV.......   jjcanoe"
527149,BUSTER,2010-12-10 16:53:00,1336,
526749,Stern Rules,2010-12-09 12:16:00,342,It's official. Howard has resigned for another five years. I was getting worried but our prayers have been answered.
526760,blaque,2010-12-09 13:23:00,2419,kind of a strange play on a word isnt it?
526763,BUSTER,2010-12-09 13:43:00,1336,I'AM SUPER HAPPY  :worthy:  :worthy:  :clapping:
526773,Rod Caster,2010-12-09 14:23:00,5784,  Took me a sec to understand.
526784,Flappn,2010-12-09 14:45:00,245,I am super excited. Stern rules
526795,Terry,2010-12-09 15:41:00,14456,funny I just checked 2 days ago and could find anything execpt the 600 milliom buck itunes hoax  but this is the news I was waiting for I will now buy sirus
526856,bucktail,2010-12-09 18:59:00,1857,Thank god...I was worried I would have to listen to normal radio again in the mornings. Now i pray that Scotty Farrell is signed loing term.......chhhecck it ouuuut!!!!
526861,solopaddler,2010-12-09 19:08:00,8605,Each to their own. To me he's a pimple on the   of society.
526862,bigugli,2010-12-09 19:12:00,6138,  You beat me to it.
526877,Flappn,2010-12-09 19:46:00,245,It's a good thing you have the option to not listen then.
526880,solopaddler,2010-12-09 19:52:00,8605, Definitely. If I was forced to listen I'd end up in a clocktower with a high powered rifle.
526910,BUSTER,2010-12-09 20:59:00,1336,OH GOOD FOR YOU
526911,kickingfrog,2010-12-09 21:12:00,8333,One more reason why I can't believe people pay money for radio.  Two incredible facts: After convincing people to pay for water when it is already in your house for pennies a bath tub. You can then get them to pay to listen to the radio.  :rofl2:  :rofl2:  P.T. Barnum knew what he was talkin' 'bout.
526918,bigugli,2010-12-09 21:42:00,6138,Was forced to listen to the   twice in someone else's car.   Never since.
526923,Terry,2010-12-09 21:50:00,14456,  I take it you don't have cable or satellite tv......................LOL and why pay for high speed internet when you can get dial-up for almost free
526933,Fishnwire,2010-12-09 22:31:00,983,"First of all...YESSSSSSS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!      Have you ever had the service?  My buddy couldn't believe I paid for satelite radio.  Then he bought a new car with a six month free subscription.  He came to me at the end of the six months and told me he had just bought a two-year extension.  Most people who try it really like it.  If you live in a town like Sudbury, you appreciate having the option of more than 3 or 4 really crudy channels.  My radio was stolen a few months back and I've been eagerly waiting to hear this news before I committed to new hardware.  I've really missed it in the time I haven't had it.  I'm buying a new radio and getting a subsciption in the next day or two."
526943,HTHM,2010-12-09 23:03:00,4082,"IMHO a lot of his ""games"" border on criminal behavior."
526945,kickingfrog,2010-12-09 23:04:00,8333,First ones always free.
526947,kickingfrog,2010-12-09 23:09:00,8333," I also have a car... not a horse, and I just up graded to a house from a cave that my ancestors had lived in for generations."
526953,BUSTER,2010-12-09 23:18:00,1336,wow
526963,solopaddler,2010-12-09 23:44:00,8605,"  Not really. He was funny for 5 minutes then his act wore thin.  He's the Diceman that just won't go away.  But hey whatever  , if you're a fan then thumbs up!"
526967,BUSTER,2010-12-09 23:56:00,1336, slight change if heart!    Did you have wine with dinner
526970,Twocoda,2010-12-10 00:18:00,4130,hey when the Diceman first came on the scene i was in his demographic of appreciation...now....not at all ....same goes for Stern...satelite radio is still awesome for the music without the commercials and blathering djs....
526980,solopaddler,2010-12-10 00:46:00,8605," Nope not really, he's still a canker. (Or maybe a wanker?  )"
527001,Gerritt,2010-12-10 02:14:00,6129,"If I dont get my fix of Dean on 102.1 in the morning I can be a cranky Mudder... the guy gets me laughing when I wake up miserable due to lack of sleep. Just wished they did not get rid of Jason....  Anyways, I had sirius for 2 years.. I listened to Stern a few times... but I can handle only so many porn star riding the Sybian only so many times.. I find his ""Shtick"" outdated and over done... he used to be considered a shock jock, not anymore.  Nor do I find him funny at all.. I went back to regular radio and haven't looked back since.  I have a Sirius receiver that will hook up to a Pioneer head unit if anyone wants it. paid 300+ sell it for a couple beers and a friendly handshake.  G"
