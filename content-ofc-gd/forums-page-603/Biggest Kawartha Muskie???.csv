526571,pooch,2010-12-08 21:59:00,139,Just wondering what is the biggest muskie caught in the Kawartha's? (By weight using a length and girth calculation)  Have any 50+ lb muskies been verified?  Thanks!
526598,Gregoire,2010-12-08 23:13:00,1397,"I'm sure other members of the board will be able to expand on this, but to my knowledge the biggest kawartha musky came out of head lake, I think it was around 35 pounds. According to what I have read and seen 35 pounds and maybe 55 inches seems to be the upper limit of musky in the kawarthas"

526677,Ron,2010-12-09 02:16:00,1683,"You would be hard pressed to find a muskie in the 50 lb class on any of the Kawartha Lakes.  This is my biggest on the Kawarthas. No where near 50lbs, lucky if it went 30lbs.    This is my PB overall, still no where near 50lbs. Somewhere between 30-40 lbs though.  "
526683,pooch,2010-12-09 02:25:00,139,"Thanks guys.  Thank you Ben for that link I had missed that post.  Ron, What were the measurements on her? Nice fish and great pics."
526792,Keenan,2010-12-09 15:19:00,59,"I caught a 40"" muskie that went 20lbs and my friend caught a 47"" that was 15lbs huge head but really skinny both caught in the scugog river."
526794,DRIFTER_016,2010-12-09 15:39:00,10439,I got a 50 incher out of Pigeon one year. No weight but probably in the low to mid 30's. My biggest is a 53 1/2 incher out of the West arm of Nippissing that weighed in at 42#'s
527106,jimmer,2010-12-10 14:55:00,2730,"I have fished in the kawarthas for at least 40 years and would be hard pressed to say that I have ever seen a muskie go over 30lbs out of any of these lakes. I would say that Balsam has the heaviest fish. They seem to lose girth in most of our lakes once they get over 50"". However, they seem to be healthier lately though, maybe eating more crappie. I would want measurements that include the girth before I believe the estimated weight of any fish. :-)"
527112,Dan668,2010-12-10 15:09:00,1120,"Uncle caught a nice one, weighed @ 37 pounds, 5 years ago. Ill see if I can get the pic for you guys. On pigeon lake."
