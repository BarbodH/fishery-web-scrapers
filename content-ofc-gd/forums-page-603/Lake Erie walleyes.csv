527196,Bob Devine,2010-12-10 19:03:00,251,Well it looks like the open water season is officially over for me. Last wknd I hit Leamington for what was the last trip of the yr. Met up with friends who were headed out perching and my boat would search for walleyes. The water was very muddy for the first 10 miles out until we got closer to Pelee Island. I decided to hit a shoal at the south end of Pelee about 20 miles from the launch with no luck and very little action on the graph we headed another 8 miles to another shoal in OH waters. The action started right away in 35fow and continued as were trolled to the end of the spot picking up 6 eyes and missing 1. Next troll we set up and sure enough the first GPS marker we hit a double and completed the troll with another 4 but missed 2. The next pass was our final as we hooked up a double but missed one and shorter there after picked up our final fish. We were runninig Rapala HJ and Reef Runners with some custom colours working well. A cool 30 mile ride back to Leamington and that is all she wrote for the open water season as everything has started to freeze over. I hope everyone had a great season and look forward to another great yr starting in April.
