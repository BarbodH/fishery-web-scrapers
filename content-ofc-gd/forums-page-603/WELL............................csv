527489,skeeter,2010-12-11 20:29:00,1907,"Well i guess its time for the report.  Picked Canadian copper up at 6am. arrived in port hopeless at 6:30. there was about 12 guys already there ahead of us. no problem there's plenty of room, so we pick our spot , get tied up and start fishing. the conga line keeps growing. spent an hour there and nobody even gets a hit. we move around to a different spot. 2 hours there a not a sniff. decided we would get back in the truck and try another place. walking back, there was about 40 people there now fishing, and not 1 single fish caught. get to the next place, people are already there fishing, we fished there for awhile and not even 1 hit for anybody. we move to the next location, same thing, people fishing and not 1 fish. we move on to yet another location,stayed there for about an hour and the same as the last 3 locations, no hits, no signs of life under the water.  well i still have my perfect record 0 for 0 for 0 for 0. Scott's reputation has been flushed down the toilet and his copper is now tarnished!!  on the positive side: IT'S NOT ME, nobody was getting anything, there's just no damn fish left in the water."

527493,mercman,2010-12-11 20:36:00,7054,"it may have been you skeets. Maybe, just maybe, if you hadnt gone to that spot, everyone else may have caught fish. BUT, ya know what......I for one, believe you, cause its happened to me too. Sometimes we get nothing but a good time on the water. Thanks for the honesty Skeets The slow bite is probably the changing weather conditions and pressure fronts moving through the areas lately."
527494,skeeter,2010-12-11 20:40:00,1907,"i knew you would say that, that is why i made sure i said that there was people ALREADY there!!!!!!!"
