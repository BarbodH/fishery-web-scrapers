Does anyone know the value or the line weight of this rod? Couldn't find any information on google. This is the 3 piece one and i also have a 2 piece one. Wonder if it's possible to use a spinning reel instead of a fly reel and fish for walleye? Any information provide will be greatly appreciated.  Thanks for reading, J. Fisher"

Some guys took the Butt cap off, and put in a 7"" fighting butt, others just fished them 'as is' If you aren't a ""fly guy""sometimes the nice slow action of a fly rod is very welcome when using light line tactics for finicky pickerel, or Rainbows."
