526987,Guest gbfisher,2010-12-10 01:30:00,0,  add it to the bothered me post.
526990,Joey,2010-12-10 01:41:00,9122,"""DISAPPOINTING DAY with Skeeter""  Isn't that what his wife always says"
526992,GBW,2010-12-10 01:47:00,8460,Mrs K is going to LOL if she reads that!  Oh so    you are Joey...
527006,Rod Caster,2010-12-10 02:21:00,5784,"i agree, cap locks are very annoying.  sorrry u didnt catch fish"
527051,young_one,2010-12-10 05:34:00,620,"Dan... its not me either But then again, my first Steelheading on the river was with CC. I didn't catch anything but a cold, Scott was putting a show! When I left around noon, later he told me he was slamming them when I was gone.  Don't worry about the caps, at my work place, the manager tells us to do any reports and written down notes in capital letters. I think its neat and easier to read.  I'll try to get up Friday morning for some steelheading, may the force be with me."
527095,skeeter,2010-12-10 14:17:00,1907,"Disappointing Day, not really. i got to go out fishing. made a new friend. found a new fishing spot(with no fish in it)LOL  with every situation i try to find the positive side & figure out what i can do about it. after long and hard thinking i have come up with mission for me. so far i have RUINED the reputation of GBW,Yonge_one & Canadian copper, as the go to steel head fishermen. my hit list is growing, but i need more victim's to help me complete my mission. LOL  Solopaddler, want to go fishing???????  how about joey, but YOU should wear a float suit"
527097,torco,2010-12-10 14:30:00,656,Pretty sure Copper has explained before that he uses caps locks because of an issue with his eye sight.  Its not to be annoying.
527099,Roy,2010-12-10 14:34:00,13728,"I find it rather exciting. Akin to reading a ransom note, eh?"
527100,GBW,2010-12-10 14:36:00,8460,LOL!!!!  I didn't know I had a reputation
527102,skeeter,2010-12-10 14:40:00,1907,"if after the G2G you didnt, well you do now geoff..."
