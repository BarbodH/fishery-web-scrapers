As I walked towards the shore I found a 2X4 to use as a spud stick. I started banging the wood against the ice and it was not breaking so I stepped on. I got off the ice and saw somebody walked and drilled some holes in the middle. My neighbour walked out, put on his boots and took me out and showed me itâ€™s about 3"" of ice! After that he got his metal ice pick and he made a hole for me to fish, sure enough I had a 2-piece rod and took the top and made my rod.  Now its time to fish!   "

527557,Jer,2010-12-11 23:00:00,1426,"I drilled a few holes in my bay today, but didn't fish. It's really too shallow to bother.  5"" of good black ice though...I'm sure the main lake has less, but some good cold weather this week should make a few inches. We have very little snow and only a couple inches forecast for tomorrow."
