526684,alexmedic,2010-12-09 02:25:00,186,"I was surfing You Tube earlier today and came upon this video:  Video Here  I have to say, it bothered me a bit..  First at around 3:12 into the video, it appears he catches a fish that has another line/ hook stuck in it's mouth and then releases it back with the hook still in.  Then at 4:32 he catches another and kicks it across the ice.  Sure it is going to be dinner, but is it just me, or does this seem uncalled for??  Don't get me wrong, I'm not trying to slam this dude personally, I have no idea who he is..."
526690,ctranter,2010-12-09 02:42:00,543,"It bothers me too, but put this in perspective dude.  There's a million more offensive things on the internet to be bothered about.  All you can do is get out there and set a good example.  There will always be idiots."

526739,alexmedic,2010-12-09 11:38:00,186,Good point. That's a good way to explain it to my daughter. Thanks
526740,alexmedic,2010-12-09 11:40:00,186,"You seem pretty upset over such a little insignificant picture!  Perhaps if you catch a fish in the near future and beat the hell out of it, you will feel much better! :-D"
526742,alexmedic,2010-12-09 11:42:00,186,I guess I can't expect everyone on this board to have decent ethics.
526766,Headhunter,2010-12-09 14:02:00,5703,"That seems a little harsh, don't yah think? If we as a group, got our underware in knots with every single thing we found offensive, well this would not be a very nice place to visit. Come to think of it, where did you get that pic of my brother, in your avatar? HH"

526839,Roy,2010-12-09 18:12:00,13728,How do they raise boneless chickens? Do they just hang'em up everywhere around the farm?
