Unless he's a big kid you might want to think about something a little shorter as 13'6"" is quite big and unweildy for someone smaller."

I have my 13' G.Loomis Frontier in 3 pieces and man, every time I'm fishing I'm asking myself why I didn't get 2 pieces rod... When my buddies are ready to fish in seconds it takes up to a minute to me to get all the line where it suppose to be and connect the three pieces together  Same when I'm packing the rod. And all of the benefits are that my rod is just a foot shorter when I put it into my car. The rod always travels in the car's saloon, not in the trunk anyways so there are usually 2-3 rods in the car when we are going fishing. And all my friends have 13' 2-pieces rods.  I would recommend Shimano Convergence close to that money, you'll get limited lifetime warranty with their good service centre in Mississauga, not somewhere in the States."
