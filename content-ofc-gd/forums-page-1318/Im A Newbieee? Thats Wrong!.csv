879,urbanangler1990,2006-11-17 02:30:00,933,"Rick told me to go back to the old board, but it redirects me to this one. The hompage is the same, the old one, then im here???"
913,Rizzo,2006-11-17 03:10:00,4754,does it really matter?  Not like # of posts will catch you more fish.  Gives you incentive to provide lots of reports if you're looking to increase your #'s
930,urbanangler1990,2006-11-17 03:20:00,933,"well sure it matters to me, i wanna have a fishing icon or all know angler on my name. yea of course it doesnt catch me more fish, but still..."
937,Rizzo,2006-11-17 03:29:00,4754,"all in time grasshopper...before you know it you'll have some ridiculous title that means squat.  I didn't even know what you meant by ""fishing icon"" at first.  To me, post count and some bestowed title don't mean a thing.  A good report is a good report regardless of how many posts you have. Now go out, catch a beauty and tell us about it."
