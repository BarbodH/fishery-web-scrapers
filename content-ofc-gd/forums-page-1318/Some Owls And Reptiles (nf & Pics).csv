55,Guest mistyriver1,2006-11-15 16:59:00,0,"My wife took my son to a bird of prey/ reptile show somewhere in Hamilton this past weekend.  She took some pics and I wanted to try posting some pics on the new new   board.  Firstly the owls, Ron, thought you might like these....      This little guy I believe is called a Screech Owl....   My youngest son Ben (7 years old) seems to have no fear of anything......       YOU WOULDN'T CATCH ME A HUNDRED FEET NEAR A SNAKE  These guys, maybe I could do......   This turned out kind of cool...     Finally, finish off with a tarantula..    A close up....  "

286,ccmtcanada,2006-11-16 14:16:00,7971,Hmmm....brave kid.  The snakes and owls I could handle....Try to put a scorpion or spider that big on me and umm...let's just say I'd scream like a little school girl.....
296,dustink,2006-11-16 14:25:00,526,Yeah...still just as scary as when it was on the old board!  nice post....  dk

567,kemper,2006-11-16 20:45:00,2232,Cool...but I could do without the snakes...spiders....scorpions....oh and anything else that crawls!

912,nautifish,2006-11-17 03:07:00,1416,Have allways been a lover of the birds of prey and all birds which is why i probably am currently owned by eight parrots....lol   Whilst living in Europe i had a barn owl had her for five yrs......She was an awesome bird   There latin name is Tyto alba  so i named her Amber . Was not so much of a mouth full....lol  When i left Europe i gave her to a guy who raised and showed these birds just like AT the event you attended.  This is just one of my many FIDS.......Autum  she is a green winged macaw.   the second picture is my U-2   Pumpkin.
