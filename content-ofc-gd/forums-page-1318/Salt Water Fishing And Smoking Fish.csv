559,verno,2006-11-16 20:39:00,178,I think it has to do with mackeral being so oily.  I have had smoked mackeral before and it was pretty good.  Maybe you have to salt it first to draw some of the oil out?
563,Fisherman,2006-11-16 20:43:00,7201,"I can't understand why they would fall apart, I buy the whole frozen ones, thaw them out, lightly salt them and keep them in the fridge overnight, trinse the next morning and directly into the smoker for 8-12 hours. I don't take the skin off or fillet them, they go in whole."
577,misfish,2006-11-16 20:53:00,29133,What happen to my response?
586,verno,2006-11-16 21:06:00,178,its right there ^
710,misfish,2006-11-16 23:09:00,29133,"Verno your just too funny  Ok my post was that I have only salted the fish from the ocean. We use to dry out the cod fillets on a mesh screen in the sun with lots of salt.Made for great fish cakes come the winter months.  Oh yeah,Simcoe Bob does make a great smoked white fish.Sampled,well devoured some at the Oro 7 G2G a couple years back.   BTW wheres that spell checky thingy?"
760,Greencoachdog,2006-11-16 23:57:00,8163,"IMO Mackeral is best Grilled, and very good when smoked while still fresh... leave the skin on and smoke whole or in large pieces... and only fit for bait or cat food after being frozen.. but that's just me."
