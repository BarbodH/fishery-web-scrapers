562,Cast-Away,2006-11-16 20:43:00,790,"Troutslayer, is there an outboard on the back of that sauna?  Sturgman, you stole my dog!"
580,TroutSlayer,2006-11-16 20:56:00,64, LOL!  I would be tempted to put it on pontoons as well as use it as an Ice Shack! It is a nice bit of carpentry.  It's in Joe's yard up in Manitouwadge!
