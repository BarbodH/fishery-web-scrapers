I had my line in the water when all of a sudden, I felt a tug on my line, of course I got excited and started to reel in, to my surprise and disappointment might I add   I caught a rock, clams, a power worm and a worm harness, bottom bouncer and line all in one, but the funny thing was, is that it was Fishindevil's line and harness that he lost 2 months earlier! If you ask me I would have rather caught a fish instead.LOL"
893,fishergirl72,2006-11-17 02:40:00,455,"I know what you mean, this is the first time that it has ever happend to me, what are my chances of that ever happening again, I hope not very good.LOL"

959,Rizzo,2006-11-17 03:52:00,4754,best part is when you reel in that found line and there is a fish still attached.  Whose would it be?
963,fishergirl72,2006-11-17 03:55:00,455,"LOL, I would say it would be mine Rizzo because that means that Fishindevil would have lost the fish to begin with.LOL"
969,Rizzo,2006-11-17 03:57:00,4754,agreed...I'd say the tackle is yours too!

978,fishergirl72,2006-11-17 04:06:00,455,"Thanks Rizzo, I agree 100% LOL  Tell me about it X-rap, that is exactly what I did when I got it home, I even clean up after him out on the water, never mind at home.LOL"
