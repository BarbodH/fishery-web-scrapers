322,Garyv,2006-11-16 14:55:00,547,Looks like a Border collie am I correct? Amy ( my dog ) has been the best traveling companion and fishing buddy for me over the last 5 years you won't regret this.

467,Bly,2006-11-16 18:33:00,1556,Nice puppy!   Many happy fishing years together!!  bly
469,steve_paul,2006-11-16 18:34:00,658,Cute looking fishing partner.  We will begin looking for one after getting back from holidays in January.
579,verno,2006-11-16 20:55:00,178,Nothing like having a dog following you everywhere.  I take mine wherever I go.  I used to have a LabXsheppard that I couldnt take fishing because without fail everytime I casted he was off and swimming for the lure before it hit the water.
587,Sherriff,2006-11-16 21:06:00,252,Nice pup. Sherriff
