553,kemper,2006-11-16 20:37:00,2232,"yep, im back.  Decided to throw a thread in and make it my first in the new forum!  Looks good so far, glad to see the members are filing in.  How do I go about getting my posts back? I was around 750 if it helps.    Heres to some more good times!"
575,wuchikubo,2006-11-16 20:51:00,1114,"Hey Kemper,  there was a thread about getting your posts count back, if I remember correctly, you have to PM Rick or one of the other admins for it.  Stan"
596,kemper,2006-11-16 21:15:00,2232,Yep I found it about 30 seconds after I posted that.  Thanks

608,kemper,2006-11-16 21:25:00,2232," Well Ive been here through a few changes, I remember the second board, then when we went to the third everyone was a little weary, after a while everyone loved it. Im sure this one will be the same, takes a little getting used to but it will be better in the long run.  By the way, has anyone else noticed how rediculously fast it is?"
612,trapshooter,2006-11-16 21:29:00,1234,"This board is much better, in many respects and must faster.  You'll get used to it in no time.   Thanks to everyone who helped to create and test it out.  Well worth the wait."
