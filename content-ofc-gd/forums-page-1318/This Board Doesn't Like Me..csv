632,bucktail,2006-11-16 21:49:00,1857,Ok this is weird.  I signed up for the new board with my old handle Bucktail. No problems I log in as bucktail with my password ... no problem. 1 problem...it displays my handle as buckail! So I thought I maybe did a typo when i signed up.... nope .. tried signing up again as bucktail and the board says its already taken....by me!!!!!!! Maybe it doesnt like T's?? Very strange indeed.  Buckail... I mean bucktail!!!!
