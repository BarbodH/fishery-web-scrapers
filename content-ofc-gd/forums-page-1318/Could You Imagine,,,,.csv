512,Pinch,2006-11-16 19:30:00,231,Great picture.  How much will Bass Pro charge for shipping and duty to Ontario?
513,setomonkey,2006-11-16 19:31:00,872,"Looks like overkill to me, how fast do they really need to go???    Mike"
514,RangerGuy,2006-11-16 19:32:00,564,WOW!  I wonder what the top end speed is...  I can't imagine they would get very far on a tank of gas with those 4 big boys on the back LOL!
536,verno,2006-11-16 20:23:00,178,Are they tied into that boat?
838,Ron,2006-11-17 01:27:00,1683,"Well, that would be a fun ride, probably better than any roller coaster. AS for paying for a portion of gas, sure no problem, just as long as there is 45 people in the boat with me."
849,lunkerbasshunter,2006-11-17 01:48:00,2585,Wow what a ride that woud be!

863,fishindevil,2006-11-17 02:17:00,6254,"wow,very nice could you imagine how much gas that machine will eat in 1 day?????"
951,DT10Sam,2006-11-17 03:44:00,480,They are only trolling right now wait until they open it up.  Sam
953,trapshooter,2006-11-17 03:47:00,1234,That rig would be a b*tch to backtroll!
960,Fisherman,2006-11-17 03:53:00,7201,"That is an outright waste of a resource, regardless if you have the money to blow on it."
965,Rizzo,2006-11-17 03:56:00,4754,with weather like that on the horizon give me as many motors as the boat can hold!
972,nautifish,2006-11-17 03:59:00,1416,I just want the boat.....  would be happy with just one of the moters...But man i bet that would be one hell of a ride......
989,kemper,2006-11-17 04:21:00,2232,you wouldnt want to crank the wheel too fast in that baby...
