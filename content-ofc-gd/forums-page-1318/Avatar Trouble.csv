926,xrap,2006-11-17 03:19:00,683,Maybe because of the program your using is down or the site. I'm using photobucket and I never had a problem with it once.
944,kennyman,2006-11-17 03:38:00,737,I just copied my avatar from the other site. Right click and save as that size and it should post no problem. Then it shouldn't have to be resized or anything. Worked for me anyway.
