157185,Hooked,2008-02-04 16:35:00,891,"A friend of mine has an Ariens snow blower.  This past weekend his motor seized on it, ownly 3 years old.  So he is in the market for a new engine for it.  I figure with all the knowledgeable people here, someone might be able to point me in the right direction to locate a new one for him.  Preferably in Canada.  Here are the specs on his snowblower:  Aarons Engine: Tecumseh Model: TH139SP 7HP - 139cc's 2 cycle Horizontal shaft  Any help would be appreciated."
157186,douG,2008-02-04 16:47:00,2693,Big Cliff should be your first contact.
157187,Fisherman,2008-02-04 16:50:00,7201,"2  cycle...I doubt that, unless your buddy has thrown the manuals and warranty papers away, it will give a list of all the repair facilities. ""Seized the motor"", that's why they have a dipstick."
157190,Hooked,2008-02-04 16:55:00,891," My buddy said for sure its a 2-cycle, and there is no dipstick with it.  He said its a 50:1 ratio for oil:gas.  He said other things, but I won't mention that."

157193,Spiel,2008-02-04 17:05:00,9065,....I mentioned this before when BigCliff was hunting down stuff but I threw away a perfect running 5 horse Tecumseh (horizontal shaft) after years of not being able to give away. Go figure!
157194,Bernie,2008-02-04 17:10:00,3190,"I have an old Iron-Horse with a kick start that Grandma used on her washing machine  A 2 stroke on a snowblower? Hmmmm. Maybe, but it seems unusual."
157201,lazybum,2008-02-04 17:39:00,142,I get my snowblower and chainsaw parts from Alpine in Scarborough.  Not cheap but convenient for me.  http://www.alpinelawn.ca/index.htm
157204,PERCHER,2008-02-04 18:07:00,787,Yup its a 2 stroke single stage blower.And its probably cheaper to fix what you have than replace the motor. Here is a link to the owners manual. http://publications.ariens.com/manuals/00447600_fra.pdf
157208,Big Cliff,2008-02-04 18:16:00,6899,See your PM
157254,Fisherman,2008-02-04 21:11:00,7201,"Well by gawd it is a 2 stroke, didn't think Ariens would fool around with 2 stroke stuff, almost looks like a rebadged Toro."
157424,JohnF,2008-02-05 02:16:00,3494, Probably explains why it seized. He's been putting the oil in the gas instead of the crankcase.  I can't say I've ever heard of a 2-stroke blower.  JF
157433,JohnF,2008-02-05 02:23:00,3494," Okeydokey. I take that back. I have now seen a 2-stroke blower. I suspect it's not really Ariens built, as someone else suggested. I don't think I've ever seen a single stage Ariens before, and I used to sell 'em. They show two models on their website now.  JF"
