Remember to introduce yourselves when you come into the shop... Nice putting a face to all the names here.  Cheers and happy fishing, I know it was tough this weekend, but all I saw even though few fish were caught was smiles...  Jen"
156968,irishfield,2008-02-03 23:30:00,26272,"WHAT>..  Spiel got out fishing, or was he lost on a dead end street?  "
156981,tjsa,2008-02-04 00:00:00,1578,"LOL, I was of the same thought pattern, Spiel, out fishing, cannot compute, lol. Chris, care to comment??????????"
156992,douG,2008-02-04 00:19:00,2693,"That was Spiel's Evil Twin, Skippy."
157113,Spiel,2008-02-04 11:10:00,9065,"....Me out fishing, don't think so. I did however take the dog out for a walk and she insisted I bring my gear along so as not to stand out among the crowd. I wanted to take the dog again this morning but the cold slushy water and ice crystals were a little tough on her wee paws.  Was nice to meet you Jen and Steve too. Sorry I didn't get to see yous on my way in but I was running late and things were rather dark around the shop. I'll be back before the season's over."
157174,Jen,2008-02-04 15:19:00,833,"Maybe we will all get out on the ice later in the season and I can see how it is you get that beautiful dog to behave so well ...  Cheers,  Jen"
157240,Joey,2008-02-04 20:36:00,9122,"I notice you said Spiel was fishing, not catching  I'd like to see pics of this Spiel fishing event.  I'm skeptical.  Joey"
