156879,forrest,2008-02-03 17:38:00,1032,Whats the downside of keeping a spare battery on board instead of one of these devices?  forrest
156881,BFSC Kevin,2008-02-03 17:43:00,1351,"well.. i would assume... extra battery = more weight, more expensive then that device, and what if that battery goes dead too? the spare battery you gotta maintain too. device = $40 in comparison to $100+ for a battery, makes sure you got enough juice to start your motor, small and light...    kevin"
156896,Mike the Pike,2008-02-03 19:32:00,3421,Kevin when I first got my Lund SSV in 2004 on my very first outing the battery went dead at the launch.luckily I had cables in my car and boosted my boat with the trolling deep cycle battery .I now carry cables on board as back up .You can always count on your trolling battery as back up just in case.A set of jumper cables are light weight and don't take up alot of space.I am sure this might not be good for your deep cycle battery but hell if your stuck it does work.

156954,irishfield,2008-02-03 23:00:00,26272,I know a few PWC's I'd like to install them on... provided I keep the remote !

157024,cisco,2008-02-04 01:06:00,597,Also read the consumer reviews on the bottom of the Cndn Tire page. Seems they may be cheap and break so the car won't start at all. I'd assume the marine one isn't better designed... so maybe the mark down to rid the stores of junk before new improved inventory arrives?
157033,Blue_Axela,2008-02-04 01:15:00,88,Pretty neat device and I've been waiting for it to go on sale as well.  However I wished it was only $20 like the auto one.  For $20 its worth a shot.
