157451,radar,2008-02-05 02:42:00,138,Anyone know of any of cottages on Stoney Lake near Burleigh Falls for early June? Also looking to hire a couple of guides (4 or 5 of us going) for my Dad's birthday present.  The pickins are pretty slim on-line.  Any help is appreciated.

Then further north and go left along north shore is Viamede Resort with cottages as well as main lodge rooms. For a cheap traditional cabin Burleigh Bait just south of the bridge has a cabin they rent that holds several but they aren't on the water or rent boats.  As for guides there are a few locals that these outfits can probably hook you up with depending on species.  Bass or walleye I suppose is your target.
