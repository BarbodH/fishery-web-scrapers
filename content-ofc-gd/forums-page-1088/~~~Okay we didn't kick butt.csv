We met up with Kris at the Carra Tackle shop, ran into Hawg Hunter, who let us know what was working, and an area we should try with a very short walk. So away we went Uncle Ben was coming from Waterloo, and was running 45min. behind, so we baited up and headed out, and only got lost twice, but we did make it, wasn't to sure for a while, plow hadn't been down the road yet. The walk was very short, about 150' from shore with 5"" of powered snow on top, we stay apart on the walk out Slug punched thr first hole, 4 turns on the auger and he was through, 2.5"" over 17'Hummmmmm, okay lets spread out. We got down to phishen, maker phish tight, and off the bottom. Kris put his camera down and said there were some weed clumps, gravel bottom, and he spotted a Perch. That was straight down , our problem there was a strong current dragging our bait away from our holes. I put down a static line with a minnow, and the other line I had a green Pimple, with a stinger, and a minnow, and I sorry Kris and Slug, I caught the first phish again, a 7"" Perch, still it's a Phish. Then at 9:00""PHISH ON"" a very nice 2.5 Walleye. I took hold of it and dropped it right on the hole, guys you never seen me move as fast as i did to grab it again before he knew he was free, got Slug to take a fast pic, and out the door it went  About 20min. later UB shows up with his buddy, and after a quick hello spread out we're sinking, they got down to some phishen  Things slowed down to a crawl Kris decide to pack it in and head for his trailer, he mention something about a back lake he was going to try later. A couple of shot of our holes   UB, and his bud also decided to move to a spot he had on his GPS he want to try, and 5 hours after I got mind I hear a very strange noise I seldom hear ""PHISH ON"", come out a see it, open the door a there he was  wouldn't shut up for the next half hour. We tried most of our lures, but nothing happen. Slug had 1 hit on his static, and that was it, by 2:30 we packed it in and headed to home, but first let take a break, Slug say  and haul for the day. I think some shrinkage happen to mine "
