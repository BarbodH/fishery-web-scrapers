157026,fishing n autograph,2008-02-04 01:08:00,2540,Why in the world did they get Tom Petty to do the show????  When in the last decade did he come out with a new album or song??? i'd rather have another Janet Jackson woopsie than hear him sing lol!!!
157029,brandon,2008-02-04 01:09:00,857,by far the worst/most boring halftime show i've ever seen.......he looks like he's going to drop dead at any second
157030,Mike Pike,2008-02-04 01:13:00,1332,I love all the 'beautiful people' they hire to surround the stage area to jump and cheer and dance.  I'll bet most don't even know who's playing...
157035,Pigeontroller,2008-02-04 01:16:00,2793,TOM PETTY ROCKS!!!   Just not at the 2008 Superbowl...
157038,pigeonfisher,2008-02-04 01:18:00,696,"room at the top...Tom Petty.  If you aren't familiar with it, you should download it.  Twas my wedding song!"
157040,irishfield,2008-02-04 01:20:00,26272,"Aww.... come on.. go easy on the lad he is getting a tad old looking, but saying that I realize I'm getting there to. Think his was the first album I bought when I went off to school in TO.... back in 79 LOL. Did he put an album out since then?  Mind you he was an ""upbeat"" from the boring game itself. Excitement was the Montreal/NY game earlier in the day! Best game of hockey I'd seen in a LONG while."
157042,urbanangler1990,2008-02-04 01:21:00,933,yea what a boring show hahaha
157046,fishindevil,2008-02-04 01:25:00,6254,I seen him in concert in 1988 i think...and he was rocking big time it was a great concert !!!! of course hes slowing down man hes been at it along time almost 30yrs..  ..its not like it was a concert it was only a half time show...i still like him
157064,SBCregal,2008-02-04 02:00:00,688,he's going on tour. gonna be in toronto later on this yr. i'm sure it'll be more exciting
157091,Bernie,2008-02-04 03:53:00,3190,I must be getting old.   I enjoyed it. But have always enjoyed Tom Petty tunes. By the way the Boston-Detroit game was a good one too Wayne.
157093,kennyman,2008-02-04 03:54:00,737,"Tom Petty was great. What did you want, Spice Girls?"
157097,mistyriver1,2008-02-04 04:16:00,600,"Actually I thought he was pretty good too...  Could have been worse, could of had a rapper out there with their three word lyrics."
157100,brandon,2008-02-04 04:25:00,857,I'd sooner stare at the spice girls then Tom Petty......I have nothing against Tom Petty.......I just don't think hes right for a superbowl halftime
157107,chickenhawk,2008-02-04 05:24:00,612,i thought tom petty rocked! i like when they bring in the older guys...good music and i thought he sounded good live.....just my 2 cents  Hawk
157118,fishdawg,2008-02-04 11:34:00,912,no complaints  - Petty is allright!  much better then any of the pop/hip hop garbage thats out these days
157147,Hookset,2008-02-04 13:29:00,367,"Was my favorite half time show yet.  Music that you could actually enjoy. Who cares what the hell he looks like? He's a GUY !!! You want the Spice girls or Janet Jackson ???  Good music is just that, good music. No matter how old.  You wanna see boobies? You got the internet.  Tom Petty Rocks.   Hookset."
157159,JohnF,2008-02-04 14:31:00,3494," Any bets the producers have a demographic study that says the average football viewer likes Tom Petty's music? Think about the market for the NFL's product. All us boomers (and I'm right on the front edge of that group) grew up with tv football and now control a large share of disposable consumer dollars. Given the amount of advertising money that's spent on the show don't you think they're looking at who's watching and tailoring the product to the market.  As a young guy I was far more interested in playing the violent games than watching 'em on tv. Nowadays I'm a watcher of violent sports and settle for fishing, diving, golf & curling as my ""contact"" sports. I often leave the tv during the halftime extravaganza because I don't usually relate to what's happening, but this time I stuck around and kinda enjoyed it's lowkeyness. But then I also enjoyed the game, so what do I know?   8)  JF"
157167,ccmtcanada,2008-02-04 14:47:00,7971,I loved the halftime show.  I thought he did a great job!
157173,danbouck,2008-02-04 15:05:00,4380,  I agree!
157214,TroutnMuskieHunter,2008-02-04 18:32:00,1362,I agree as well....petty was great....he sang in tune and had the crowd singin along as well!!  What/who are spice girls
157219,Roy,2008-02-04 18:50:00,13728,"Knocking a member of the ""Trembling Wheelbarrows"" is outrageous!"
157227,Whopper,2008-02-04 19:49:00,2174," Yep I liked it, although I didn't see it I listen to it.  Wayne you must be an offensive type of guy  , being a defensive coach for years with the young men I found it was a good game. A lot better than the usual blowouts."
157228,Terry,2008-02-04 19:54:00,14456,yo wazz up should da had 50cent  or maybe a few of these guys A.W.O.L. AMG ATC AZ Above the Law Ace Deuce Acres Home Players Ad Money African Identity Against the Grain Agent Hook Ak-D Al Kapone Already Riders Amar Pep    petty did just fine
157244,Stoty,2008-02-04 20:42:00,2910,"I am 25 yrs old, and I thought the show was great. I enjoy Tom's music. Sure he isn't as ""energetic"" as some people might like, but he did exactly what he was there to do: entertain. How often do you get to hear 70,000ish people sing along with a song?  Mind you, if I had the choice I would take a Shania Twain or Carrie Underwood in a heartbeat. Maybe if Dallas would have made it, they would have had Jessica Simpson play. I guarantee you Dallas would have lost then!  All in all, I really enjoyed the show, and good for him for still ""having it""."
