156714,Guest gbfisher,2008-02-02 22:06:00,0,You bought an Nfusion  did you Pocoyo?....  Should be an interesting fight.
156715,Gerritt,2008-02-02 22:08:00,6129,Nope... I would not touch Nfusion if it was given to me...  My pansat is down.. so I paid for it.  Gerritt.
156716,Gerritt,2008-02-02 22:09:00,6129,PS.... full EMU in a couple days  G.
156718,Terry,2008-02-02 22:14:00,14456,Had a Nfusion for about a year now and would be without it  not to mention the ONLY game in town......I will be watching it
156722,Guest gbfisher,2008-02-02 22:40:00,0,I'm just glad that Dish has it....
156726,Gerritt,2008-02-02 22:59:00,6129,"Terry,  we need to talk about your STB...  G"
156727,irishfield,2008-02-02 23:01:00,26272,Was that a B or a D Gerritt ?
156729,Gerritt,2008-02-02 23:03:00,6129,  LOL! STB = Set top box..  His sat receiver.  G.
156734,Guest gbfisher,2008-02-02 23:12:00,0,"  I had a router and Nfusion in my hand the other day. Thought twice and put it back.  Thinking back now, I should have kept it......"
156737,Gerritt,2008-02-02 23:25:00,6129,GB fisher..... you do not want Nfusion... willing to do federal time? go ahead..... IKS is/will be the downfall for Nfusion.  You made a smart choice.  G
156768,Guest gbfisher,2008-02-03 01:08:00,0,It's OK Pocoya. There will be no Federal time spent with an Nfusion up and running. That'd Be like going after the criminals with hand guns........lol.....   I'll wait and see what happens in the next few weeks relating to full Emu. I'm not holding my breath.
156776,danc,2008-02-03 01:15:00,4677," Oh man, we think alike Gerritt. If only I was closer..."
156794,Terry,2008-02-03 03:08:00,14456,I don't think he was in the movie hearthbreak ridge he would have been about 11 years old when that movie was made  if I am thinking about the right guy
156812,jdmls,2008-02-03 05:59:00,575,he slugged Mir a few times and had the first round in points until experience took over and Mir set him up for the kill with the knee lock....would love to see Lesnar battle it out toe to toe with another stand up fighter
156830,Deano,2008-02-03 12:20:00,767,"Yeah Lesnar and Silvia would of been a better fight, as would Nogera and Mir. These big guys need to learn to finish a fight, they know how to hit, but if the guys not out, there lost to figure a way to finish. Need to work on there ground game more. Still was a pretty good night of fights."
156857,misfish,2008-02-03 15:28:00,29133," I could of swore it was him,the guys name is Peter Koch .  Thought it was over early.Dam"
156867,bucktail,2008-02-03 16:24:00,1857,"Just like I thought, It takes MANY years to become a good submission technician. If it was Royce in his prime the result would have been faster and Lesnar would have been without an arm or leg for the next 6-8 weeks. They should have put him in with Kimbo Slice....now that would have been entertaining!"
156903,douG,2008-02-03 19:57:00,2693,Kyra is amazing too.
156928,jat,2008-02-03 21:38:00,138,I just gotta say this -  Lesnar is either going to eat his opponent alive or he's gonna lose so fast it'll make your head spin.
156941,Terry,2008-02-03 22:09:00,14456,I enjoyed the card  some interesting fights  I love the way Tim (The Barbarian) Boetsch  fights
157077,sharper,2008-02-04 02:50:00,279, I predicted the fight!
156425,misfish,2008-02-01 22:13:00,29133,Im looking forward to this one. This guy is built to DESTROY.
156429,Gerritt,2008-02-01 22:15:00,6129,I was waiting for this post.....  He is a NATIONAL champion wrestler. The real deal.  Yes he paid his bills being in the WWE/WWF  This man is a serious threat in the Heavy Weight class...  Wrestlers have traditionally done well in MMA...  Mir is about to get his big mouth shutup  G.
156431,Riparian,2008-02-01 22:16:00,269,I just hope UFC dosent turn into WWE.
156434,rhare,2008-02-01 22:19:00,387,"Lesnar isnt the first ""pro wrestler"" to fight MMA  most dont make out well but he will definatly be different. His NCAA record was 163-3 I believe  guy is a freak, his first fight is on youtube check it out if you havent already"
156435,rhare,2008-02-01 22:22:00,387,"    could never happen, its real fighting."
156439,misfish,2008-02-01 22:27:00,29133,"And dont forget,he is a movie star,Heart Break Ridge. THE SWEED."
156440,dobee,2008-02-01 22:33:00,301,"frank mirs big mouth? Mir is a champion, he doesnt talk smack, atch inside the UFC 81..... mir is a gent... lesnar on the other hand is a muscle head who cant put a full sentence together..... lesnar is gonna get a reality check this weekend, just because you can wrestle does not mean you can be sucessful in MMA.   go mir..."
156449,Burtess,2008-02-01 22:42:00,901, Mir is going to prevail....  Burt
156469,bassmaster4,2008-02-01 23:20:00,801,Lesnar is a joke sure he can dish out some major @$$ kickings but he goes from WWE to Pro Football to UFC who knows whats next after he gets bored of the UFC.     P.S for those who like him please take no offence i just said my opinion.
156482,sharper,2008-02-01 23:39:00,279,"I'm rooting for Mir. Mir has good submission skills for a heavyweight. Let's not forget he was the heavyweight champ after he broke 6'8"" gaint Tim's forearm. If Mir's conditioning is good he should be able to pull off a submission win over inexperience Lesnar."
156500,Rich,2008-02-02 00:24:00,3927,Send him back to WWE.
156504,pigeonfisher,2008-02-02 00:28:00,696,Anyone else planning to go to Montreal?
156509,Riparian,2008-02-02 00:32:00,269,"Im not refering to his wrestling skills. Your right, wrestlers do well in the MMA. Just look at Kevin Randleman. What I hate seeing is the scripted drama that you see between fighters, like Tito Ortiz and Ken Shamrock."
156526,Crazyhook,2008-02-02 01:30:00,1154,"LOL @ Mir not trash talking...  I hope Brock Wins, Mir has been really unimpressive in his last few fights."
156548,glirw,2008-02-02 02:10:00,200,"Neither of these guys is known for their endurance, so they will probably both get fatigued before the fight ends, which will make for a somewhat borefest.  I expect Brock to catch Mir with a punch and take him down, where he will control the fight until he gets caught in a submission.  I don't think he is as good at avoiding submissions as Mir is at applying them, then again Mir might be able to catch Brock with a sloppy punch or something."
156602,Deano,2008-02-02 13:13:00,767,"Not really sure how it's gonna play out, but I really wanna see this fight, should be interesting."
156650,bucktail,2008-02-02 15:14:00,1857,Too bad Gracie wasnt in his prime.....nothing funnier then seeing a 400 pound roid monster pound on a little guy for 5 minutes then start crying like a baby and tapping out. UFC used to be so much better. Now everyone fights with the exact style...all very good fighters but not as intriguing!
156659,charlesn,2008-02-02 15:59:00,551,"My prediction is Brock by GnP.  First off, you can't choke him out because he wasn't born with a neck.  lol  You might be able to arm bar him.  I think he might especially be susceptible to ankle and knee bars.  But the guy is a freak, he will be CUTTING to the 265 weight limit, and not a whole lot of that is fat...  He has a high pain threshold since most pro rasslers have a ridiculous pain threshold to be able to put on a good show.  The tomato can he beat up was an Olympic silver medalist in Judo.  He was ridiculously overmatched and succumbed to hammer fists from the half-guard I think.  I think it was just from being overwhelmed by a physical specimen like no other.  Not sure if you guys saw the latest quip from Hendo, but he pretty much revealed why the Pride FC guys are getting smoked in fights in jurisdictions with steroid testing.  They don't test over there so why not use them?  It does explain a lot.  Charles"
156663,Guest gbfisher,2008-02-02 16:20:00,0,  It's been going that way since it started.  Rules or rounds for UFC?????  ..........................
156684,misfish,2008-02-02 18:13:00,29133," No neck,thats for sure.   It should be just rounds if anything. ULTIMATE FIGHTING. NO RULES.  Gracie was an AWESOME fighter,but Im sure if one got a good shot at that chin,LIGHTS OUT.   griwl,you hit it,but IMO,if Brook hits him,it,s over.No chance for submission.  Just a side note,I think Mirko Cro Cop and Brook would be a better fight. Two monsters."
156686,misfish,2008-02-02 18:19:00,29133,Anyone know when Shamrock is going to make a come back.
156691,highdrifter,2008-02-02 19:10:00,2534, No kidding!  That's a nice little tidbit there.  That was the best part of that movie ahaah!
156693,Gerritt,2008-02-02 19:24:00,6129,"Well, all I know is I will have it on here in High Def.. and playing a little poker. If your local to Hamilton your more then welcome to stop by, have a drink and plop your butt at the poker table, while watching some MMA.  We play for loonies so no big deal...  Gerritt"
156701,Crazyhook,2008-02-02 21:08:00,1154, actually I think he just signed with Strikeforce...
156705,misfish,2008-02-02 21:33:00,29133, Hey G If I was closer I would be there brother.
