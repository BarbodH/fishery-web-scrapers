156483,jat,2008-02-01 23:49:00,138,"I wonder if anyone's using these things, any success with it? Also, Chubby darters, I hear they work good but you can't find them anywhere."
156485,troutologist,2008-02-01 23:53:00,951,The glow and blue/pink buckshot in 3/4oz has been the undoing of quite a few lakers through the ice this winter. The smaller size in chartreuse has also been a good perch bait.
156491,buckster,2008-02-02 00:11:00,530,"Ive had great luck using these spoons for pics,perch,crappie and also lakers and whities.  Try the gold ones they seem to do the trick aswell"
156492,Sinker,2008-02-02 00:13:00,8692,I always have a rod with a buckshot tied on it. I use it for everything. The silver one is my favourite....1/2 oz. size  Sinker
156493,jat,2008-02-02 00:18:00,138,"I hate bringing minnows with me, I hear that if you don't tip it your catch percentage is cut by half. What's the technique for jigging it properly? Thanks"
156495,jat,2008-02-02 00:20:00,138,forgot to ask if anyone has been out to Roches point on Simcoe
156496,Rich,2008-02-02 00:22:00,3927,"Most of the time the best way to jig is give it a tiny twitch and wait 30 seconds to a minute before giving it another twitch. Great baits. Always been more of a ""Kastmaster' man myself though."
156502,jat,2008-02-02 00:25:00,138,So Rich do you think its vital to tip with minnows or is it fine by itself?
156507,jat,2008-02-02 00:31:00,138,"I'm also looking at the Lil Foxee Jigging Minnow from Bluefox. So much to buy, so little cash lol."
156511,Mark Kulik,2008-02-02 00:34:00,348,"Great spoon! works great on just about everything, I do well in the fall on smallmouth with the gold 1/2 oz."
156529,Jen,2008-02-02 01:32:00,833,Buckshots are the Hottest Bait on the Grand River for walleye  ..always tipped with minnows or spikes...
156554,jat,2008-02-02 02:43:00,138,So is it the scent that puts them over the edge or do they need to feel some meat on the hook to get them to hang on?
156562,Blake,2008-02-02 03:33:00,418,We have both baits and the new Flyer spoons at Fishing World if you are looking to purchase.  Tip the trebles with maggaot 2 per hook or just the head of a minnow.  Sometimes a full minnow on the spoon actually will throw off the proper action where just a head on the trebles increase hook ups.
156567,fishinggeek,2008-02-02 03:41:00,325,"I haven't used them either, but they do look good.  One thing you might want to note is that this is one of the very few items that is actually cheaper at Bass Pro than Le Baron, at least the last time I checked."
156584,Joeytier,2008-02-02 04:44:00,3990,"I've been only been out on the ice twice this season, but the buckshot has already popped a huge perch a good sized eye (glow in the dark/green colour).  I already have confidence in the buckshot"
156620,Rich,2008-02-02 14:16:00,3927, Depends what you're fishing for.  Walleye & Perch I always tip with a minnow or waxie.  Crappie - I might throw a waxie on or some maggots.  Pike and other fish I usually won't tip unless it's a really slow bite and I do it as a last resort.
156622,ecmilley,2008-02-02 14:23:00,2163,I use them on my windlass tip-ups let the wind jig them with a big fat minnow on the bottom get pretty good success for eyes
156912,jat,2008-02-03 20:44:00,138,I used the glow perch on Simcoe today and did ok...nothing big but it was fun - next time walleyes.
156913,jat,2008-02-03 20:44:00,138,and I tipped the lure with some power maggots....worked out well.
157068,bramptonjerry,2008-02-04 02:19:00,132,"I'm no pro but I read in one of the 50 or so fishings mags that I subscribe to recently an article were the guy was talking about rattle spoons and the great success he was having wally fishing thru the ice.  So much so that he tried an experiment where he glued some rattles to one of his regular spoons....great success also....then the rattles fell off and the success continued, he then came up with the conclusion that it wasn't the rattles so much as the action he was imposing on them to activate the rattles,  that was resulting in his success......just thought I'd throw that in there"
157089,troutologist,2008-02-04 03:46:00,951,Chalk up another success for the 3/4 oz buckshot. Tipped with a minnow it was the only bait i found this weekend that worked. accounted for 6 or 10 lakers and specks. 20fow and less. jigged subtlety.
