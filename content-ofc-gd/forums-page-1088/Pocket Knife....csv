156724,huntervasili,2008-02-02 22:45:00,1604,"Hey all... Just looking at getting a new pocket knife... I have Alot of em right now with 4 of em being swiss army, and several gerbers and others. I have been looking at the Case Knives and really like the look and feel of em. I want a simple one with 1-3 blades max, no tools. Palm Sizes so a 3.5 min inch handle up to maybe 5"" or so. I like Stag handle but would consider anything except synthetic. So if anyone has any input and quality reports on what you have used, it would be much appreciated. Thanks in advance"
156731,Daplumma,2008-02-02 23:08:00,1961,"Bill,I carry this one sometimes.Very fine blades,good craftsmanship,holds and edge well.I prefer a lockblade for what I use it for but its a nice Sunday go to meeting knife.http://www.wrcase.com/knives/view_all/browseview2.php?Family=""Amber%20Bone""&View=1&Item=0262 Take a look at this thread.http://www.ofncommunity.com/forums/index.php?showtopic=15230&hl=knives Joe"
156736,Greencoachdog,2008-02-02 23:25:00,8163,"I tote a Case knife Bill. Like anything else, you get what you pay for. Stay away from the Case CV (chrome vanadium) they WILL rust. Go with the 6.5 stainless, much better knife!"
156740,huntervasili,2008-02-02 23:32:00,1604,"Thanks boys... Funny thing Joe... I was looking at that same knife, except in medium, not two days ago and asked the guy to pull a new one out after I saw the display, ready to buy it, and he looked for 30 mins with no success, so I figured maybe I should ask here before I get one... looks like I am looking in the right direction."
156744,Daplumma,2008-02-02 23:47:00,1961,"I reckon that the Case is redneck approved to be sure.I like a small pocket knife,if I need bigger I have one in the work truck or boat.I think Dawg has the same one in a larger size. Joe"
156755,bassjnkie,2008-02-03 00:41:00,1101,"All I have to say is ""BENCHMADE"". Awsome knives."
156763,irishfield,2008-02-03 01:00:00,26272,"My ""pocket"" knife... a free advertising hand out from Dupont Plastic Resins division that actually cuts pretty good, but I don't care if I use for a screw driver. The knife I depended on, to get me out of a bind... top end Leatherman that now resides on the bottom of Spawning Lake, Temagami, in it's leather case.  That reminds me what to ask for.. for me birthday ! Scuba tanks...... or a new leatherman !"
156834,ChrisK,2008-02-03 12:54:00,2772,I'll second the Boker made knives. Ive had a lock back for about 15 years now and its as good as the day I bought it. Very well put together....
156863,OhioFisherman,2008-02-03 16:06:00,6623,"Personal choice item, very hard to say that what would suit me would be good for you. I have some case, boker, victor inox, but wind up carrying a cheap Japanese made pocket knife most of the time. Loss or breakage? No real loss, dang thing won`t break though, like 25 years.  Real hard to find quality in some styles, like to find a out the front with a 2 1/2 inch blade."
156889,Burtess,2008-02-03 18:59:00,901," My edc's are either Benchmade or Spyderco.  These two companies really lead the pack with respect to design and materials used.  Superior steel than that used by Case, Victorinox, etc...  Burt"
156902,douG,2008-02-03 19:53:00,2693,"I haven't tried a  Benchmade or Spyderco, but that Gerber you've seen me with suits me very well."

157509,TroutnMuskieHunter,2008-02-05 11:37:00,1362,I carry the Spyderco Bryd knife which I find is a nice light knife for your pocket. I bought my son-in-law 2 different models and he loves them!!  http://www.spyderco.com/catalog/list.php?category=14
