157423,moosehead,2008-02-05 02:16:00,90,"Young Jason Vorhees was drowned in Crystal Lake way back in 1957. A subsequent fire and spate of murders resulted in the camp being shut down. Years later Steve Christy decides to reopen Camp Crystal Lake and hires a new group of councillors to have the place ready for the summer. Ignoring warnings from the local lunatic, they go ahead with the reopening regardless. Things seem to be going as planned until the killings begin again ~  camp was shut down in 1957 so 20 years later would be 1977???"
157425,irishfield,2008-02-05 02:18:00,26272,TJ is gonna have to give two prizes this time... first he asked when did the camp reopen so you have to go by the script timeline date and next he said when was it released and you have to give it to Bernie.
157426,ccmtcanada,2008-02-05 02:19:00,7971,"Check out Maureen's answer...she edited hers at 9:08, Bernie posted at 9:09...so if it's 1980 then I think she'll win...."
