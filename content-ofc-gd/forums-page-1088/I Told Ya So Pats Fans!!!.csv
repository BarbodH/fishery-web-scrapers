157274,Woodsman,2008-02-04 22:52:00,1286,"I tried telling the same thing to people last week. No one would believe me.   Go figure they should know I'm never wrong. Once I thought I was wrong, but I was mistaken. I figured if the could beat my team the Packers they were unstoppable."
157290,Rizzo,2008-02-04 23:37:00,4754,..and naturally you guys were so confident in your predictions you placed huge wagers and today you're rich!
157297,danc,2008-02-04 23:46:00,4677," That's nothing. I predicted last weekends 649 numbers. But like you, I forgot to bet."
157510,steve_paul,2008-02-05 11:51:00,658,Where were all you genius prognosticators before my first wedding?
157511,Roy,2008-02-05 11:56:00,13728,"I'm not a betting person but had someone put $1,000. on the Giants 5 games away from the bowl and let it ride, they'd be up $32,000. today."
