157131,lunkerbasshunter,2008-02-04 12:55:00,2585,great report!  looks like a fun day!  Cheers!
157139,Spiel,2008-02-04 13:06:00,9065, It's always good to have a second option if the lakers are off. I've always wanted to take a winter trip up that way and Superior whities would be high on my target list.
157145,ccmtcanada,2008-02-04 13:17:00,7971,"Hey Tom!! Great to hear from you again and one heck of a report as well.  Congrats on a great day out there.  I've been fishless for more weeks than I care to admit, so I'm living thru all of you guys who get out there on the ice."
157161,solopaddler,2008-02-04 14:34:00,8605,"Nice report, thanks for taking the time to post!"
157222,Smokey,2008-02-04 19:12:00,1278,Great report Tom and it's about time. Been a long time since you've putting up some fish for us to see.  Thanks  Mike
157235,wuchikubo,2008-02-04 20:31:00,1114,"Great to see a report again Tom, almost thought you might have forgotten that you're suppose to do some fishing while maintaining this awesome community board.  Now, I'd better do my part soon and get on some fish too. BTW do you still need the help you mentioned about in the fall? If so, let me know, as I may be able to get something tonight.  Stan"
157237,highdrifter,2008-02-04 20:35:00,2534,Great stuff Tom.  Glad one of us made it out this weekend.   How did they taste?!  cheers HD
157299,tjsa,2008-02-05 00:00:00,1578," NO, no, no, you made the mistake others have made. I am tjsa, from the Great White North, Thunder Bay,  TJQ is the guy who owns OFC."
157301,tjsa,2008-02-05 00:08:00,1578," I was going to find out today, but yesterday I decided to give both of them to my neighbor, since he has cleaned my driveway 3 times this year when I have been at work, getting home at 7:30 pm or later. He also accepted of a couple of packages that were delivered to me when I was at work. Gotta tell ya, its nice to come home to a cleaned driveway at that time of night in the dark hours from late fall to mid winter, and nice to have a neighbor like him, our driveways are basically shared, no divider. Sometimes I do his and mine by myself also, but he usually gets it done before I get the chance. And, he is 78 yrs. old, so he deserves it."
157307,TroutnMuskieHunter,2008-02-05 00:28:00,1362,Great report lads!!  ....nice eatin' trout and good pics too!!...thanks for sharing
157116,Spiel,2008-02-04 11:32:00,9065,....Sweet fishing there Tom. I love icing north country lakers and they're just fine in the pan too. Curious though do you ever target whities in those trout lakes up there?
157123,Whopper,2008-02-04 12:21:00,2174,Well done!  Glad to see you get out and have some fun!  Thanks for sharing Tom
157125,b2kptbo,2008-02-04 12:35:00,1505,"Good one, thanks..."
157127,tjsa,2008-02-04 12:42:00,1578,"No we don't, not many people up here do on the inland lakes, mostly and incidental catch. But they are targeted on lake superior in 3 or 4 places. We keep saying we should try for them, but haven't gotten around to it yet."
