157007,rhare,2008-02-04 00:44:00,387,Well after yesterday how could I not head back out! Simcoe didnt fail me again. Fished the same area with GBaysteel (Dan) and it was none stop action. we stopped counting at 13 lakers!! And lost at least that many more. The fish were so aggressive all but 3 came on spoons. It was almost like perch fishing.Today started slow but a couple lure changes and jigging variation and they turned right on. So in total almost 50 lakers in 2 days!!! wow only kept a couple that seemed like they might not survive. heres some more pics enjoy Dan starting the day off right   me lookin happy         hard to see but look at the fish on bottom and suspended   Dan with a nice one
