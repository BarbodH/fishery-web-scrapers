156589,GbayGiant,2008-02-02 05:43:00,1780,"I'm guessing 45-10 for the Pats, not much of a game, but the Pats are going down as the best team ever or the Giants can take the biggest upset ever, so it's interesting either way."
156618,Dano,2008-02-02 14:10:00,719," Cheaters deserve to win? Oh well.....  I hope the Giants win, but I cant see it happening."
156633,Canuck2fan,2008-02-02 14:48:00,1444, I have a feeling the scalpers will make more money than the league on ticket sales. I just wish I had the 77 grand to toss around on a club seat... who I am kidding that kind of coin woulld just about get half me the fishing gear I want to add to my collection LOL  I don't care about the game at all really but it would be cool to see an upset and have another Manning win it.
156635,lunkerbasshunter,2008-02-02 14:53:00,2585,the pts havent covered the spread in a while.  i will take the pats to win but the giants will beat the spread.  cheers!
157079,brifishrgy,2008-02-04 03:03:00,559,  I was close ... but they still won
157080,Daplumma,2008-02-04 03:06:00,1961,One of the best Super Bowls I've seen! Congrats to the Giants! Joe
157094,mistyriver1,2008-02-04 04:04:00,600, :clapping:  Now if only I had bet on it  18 - 1  Sorry Moss  Great football game !!!
157102,GbayGiant,2008-02-04 04:49:00,1780,"Insane, somebody got rich from a bet."
157239,Kirk,2008-02-04 20:36:00,347,"That was an easy 100 for me...the happy intersection of sports and money.  Aside from being an underdog fan, I hate to point out the obvious, but Pats never had a shot at a 'perfect' season...my definition of perfect doesn't include getting written up for having a Dishonest coach.  Or have refs steering a game or two, nothing too outrageous, towards a high ratings season finale.  So it looks like the only D that counts is Defence.  Belichek should have gone for a b&e and stolen the playbook if he wanted the Superbowl, and Brady the drama queen waltzing thru NYC in a cast...best comedy is real life.  LOL"
157252,mistyjr1,2008-02-04 21:04:00,97,Great Game it was!!  How are you feeling Cliff
157256,HTHM,2008-02-04 21:15:00,4082,WOOO HOOOOO I was right!
156395,mistyriver1,2008-02-01 19:48:00,600,"Who do you think is gonna win.  Myself, I'd take the points and the Giants.  If the Giants ""D"" can pressure Brady like they did against Dallas and Green Bay, it might be interesting."
156396,irishfield,2008-02-01 19:51:00,26272,The ticket sales office !
156397,danbouck,2008-02-01 19:54:00,4380,After being at the Bills game when the Bills lost to the Pats 56 - 10    The Pats better win!
156399,ccmtcanada,2008-02-01 20:18:00,7971,"I don't even know who's in it.  I just go to my buddy's place, eat chili, drink and hang out.  Isn't that what the Superbowl is about?"
156401,Puckhead,2008-02-01 20:31:00,377,It isn't even going to be close...  I'd love to see a good game or maybe even an upset but the bottom line is I think we will be watching history come Sunday.  Pats by 21.
156412,Gerritt,2008-02-01 21:08:00,6129,Simple.....   GIANTS!  G.
156416,misfish,2008-02-01 21:15:00,29133, 
156418,OhioFisherman,2008-02-01 21:31:00,6623,Pats! People that coached for Cleveland always try harder elsewhere so they don`t have to go back!  Really? Pats! Just so them old dudes from Miami can cut back on the booze! No party this year!
156433,Kirk,2008-02-01 22:19:00,347,"Take the points, I think its up to 14 now, and the Giants and enjoy rooting for the underdog spoiler.  I think the Giants getting a second look at the Pats so early after their loss will take advantage of it."
156436,lookinforwalleye,2008-02-01 22:24:00,4399,If I was betting I would take the points!
156445,Rich Clemens,2008-02-01 22:40:00,3131,I'll go for the underdog ... Giants.
156453,PAZE,2008-02-01 22:49:00,132,"No team deserves to win other then the Pat's, the dominated this season and deseve a perfect season, but if I was a betting man I would take the Giants"
156459,bassmaster4,2008-02-01 23:11:00,801,Giants! Peyton last year Eli this year!  P.S GO REDSKINS!!!
156460,Want,2008-02-01 23:11:00,39,"  Good point. But I think it will be the other way. The Pats have had a second look at the Giants and will, as always, adjust. Pats have it."
156462,mistyjr1,2008-02-01 23:15:00,97, Actually Cliff thats not true... SuperBowl  Dont eat and drink to much chilli and beer...    Mistyjr1
156465,brifishrgy,2008-02-01 23:16:00,559,Giants by 6
156466,silveradosheriff,2008-02-01 23:18:00,1025,Just hoping for a close game.....
156477,tjsa,2008-02-01 23:30:00,1578," I am in agreement with Cliff on this one, lol. I do know who is playing, and will watch it, but I remember a few parties with buds where the Chili and drinks, along with cards ahead of the actual game was way more enjoyable. Sure, we watched the game, and some of the guys were rooting for one side or the other, but the food was probably more important. And, it was always someone's rooten' tooten' super hot, gastrointestinal attacking, type of chili, with hot peppers added on top, just for the heck of it, lol.  Oh, and beer, to wash it down nicely."
156518,Beats,2008-02-02 01:02:00,543,"  That's what it's all about.  The Super Bowl is the only football game I watch each year.  Sometimes the Grey Cup game as well.  I, more often than not, can't even tell you the teams involved most years until the game starts or I hear it mentioned on American Tv in the days before the game.  I don't even really watch the game seeing as I still to this day can't tell you what 1/2 the positions in football are supposed to be doing.  It's just a gathering of friends hanging around eating and drinking and sitting in front of a screen for hours on end but always turns out to be a good night, football or not."
156525,Terry,2008-02-02 01:27:00,14456,don't care who wins I bet on the spread
156530,OhioFisherman,2008-02-02 01:33:00,6623,
156532,HTHM,2008-02-02 01:35:00,4082,The team with the most points at the end of the game.
156533,mistyjr1,2008-02-02 01:37:00,97, Its actually a painted senators helmet
156573,kennyman,2008-02-02 03:58:00,737,I've got a buddy that's a huge Giants fan and he's going through some tough times right now so I'll be pulling for the Giants. Go Eli !
156575,jjcanoe,2008-02-02 04:06:00,744,"Super what???  I'm going fishing, Walleye are on fire right now......So I guess I'll try and land a Giant walleye and then get a few Pats on the back.  jjcanoe"
