156055,snag,2008-01-31 17:26:00,1932,"Greetings,  Please see below:  Meant to post this in September. oops  This is my niece with her first pike. I took her on a multi-dockside fishing trip to reconnect (hadn't seen her for awhile) SHE WAS SOOOOO EXCITED! It was a great day. She still brings it up every time we talk now. She is a natural at fishing. She landed and released the pike with minimal help from me. A crowd quickly assembled on the dock while she worked it.  Watch the video, the pike freaks and wacks my camera within mm of the water!  VIDEO:  Total crowd pleaser. There's even more people back there. The other kids there thought she was a goddess for catching a pike!  Here is a small bass caught after dinner  aaaaaaand the release  She's caught some lunker bass since the age of 3!  Here's a mini pike. No she's not smokin' it's a sucker. love the glasses! She thought they were magic water glasses!    Filler,  Poor pic of musky skull but you can see why they hurt other critters    buh bye  S."
156066,ccmtcanada,2008-01-31 17:55:00,7971,Priceless...just priceless Grant.  She handled that fish like a pro!  She had a good coach as well.  Looks like your camera got slimed too...LOL.  Ok...fess up now....you started catching more pike AFTER fishing with her....I think we know who taught who in the art of pike fishing....
156071,Headhunter,2008-01-31 18:15:00,5703,"After looking at her pics and the video, I concur... she is a goddess!  Absolute sweetie! You must be very proud! HH"
156079,snag,2008-01-31 18:53:00,1932," Yes, yes, I admit it; She's taught me everything I know.   She was the first grandchild in the family. She is extremely smart and mature. Her behaviour is exemplary. I am proud"

156408,kennyman,2008-02-01 21:00:00,737,"She's really cute. She was very cool in the video, almost nonchalant. I think the glasses suit her  . Nice job uncle Snag! Maybe she'll follow in your footsteps. Next you can teach her to dump her bike and cell phone in the water   . Sorry, had to throw that in there   ."
