156970,steverowbotham,2008-02-03 23:34:00,1800,"I headed up to Nipissing this weekend with the company of my girlfriend Kelli and my dad.  We spent Friday to Sunday in a bungalow with Grump and Grumpy's.  We've been going there for three years, these guys are great, and the fishing is usually just as good.  minnows worked well as always, but I dropped to light line (3 lbs) and 1/16 oz jigs to test out my new ultralight ice rod and new vexilar unit, good choice, because big whities are fun on 3lbs test.  We ended up with 7 whities, 3 returned.  Lots of perch and herring, 2 pike and 1 walleye, plus a smelt.  Good variety to say the least.  Great Weekend overall   First whitie of the night, 8:48 pm   Kelli with a little pike on 4 lbs line and my crappie rod, lots of fun   Going light, perch fishin   Goin light for whities   double whites   Kelli with her evening whitie   During an intense game of crazy eight countdown, the tipup .... went up   Final haul for starving college students"

157158,solopaddler,2008-02-04 14:30:00,8605,"Nice report Steve! Question for ya though... Over the years I've caught a whack of whitefish in Nippissing, it really is a great and underutilized fishery.. Anyhow, the few I have kept to eat have always been infested with worms, really grossed me out. How were the ones you guys kept? Just curious..  Cheers,  Mike"
