147340,tip-up,2008-01-02 16:37:00,94,"Well, I would like to start off by throwing out a big Happy New Year to everyone at OFC!  07' was a great year..  It was nice to get out on the ice a bit earlier this season compared to the last where we had to go through the phases of watching it come and go a few times  :roll: As soon as I got word that a few local haunts were locked up, I was out there. Had the chance to fish with many faces I usually don't see that often until this season. On top of that many buddies and of coarse  my bro Jig Head.  Heres a little bit of how she went...                   Wishing everyone a fresh start and best of luck in 2008  Tip-up"
