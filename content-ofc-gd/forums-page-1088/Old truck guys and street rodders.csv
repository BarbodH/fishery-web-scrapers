156883,kennyman,2008-02-03 17:54:00,737,"You gotta admit it's a cool truck, but I agree with you OhioFisherman, 66/7 Dueces are sweet. Our family has owned a performance shop for the last 33 years and although I appreciate pretty much all of the North American muscle, the bowtie will always be my first love."
156936,Daplumma,2008-02-03 22:01:00,1961,"I had a few 65 and 64 Chevy 2's and loved them.I now have a 65 Ford truck with a 390,headers,Holly double pumper,C-6 power disc brakes and power steering.The Ford power that they are using is rock solid but ford power is expensive to make.63K is way out of my price range. Joe"

Like Kennyman, I have a soft spot in my heart for the GM stuff but have realized they are not the only player in town. My favorite fun car was my 78 Camaro 350 4 speed. But for a cruiser my Mom has a 95 Buick Roadmaster with the LT1 engine that gets incredible fuel economy along with a great ride and power. What a beautiful car!"
157001,irishfield,2008-02-04 00:36:00,26272,I think you should buy at least one Joe... and show us how well it hauls a boat come June !
