157229,Pigeontroller,2008-02-04 20:00:00,2793,I just got quoted a good price on an Apollo Stainless prop for my Yamaha F90. Just curious if anyone has one?

157238,lookinforwalleye,2008-02-04 20:36:00,4399,Hey Dax just wondering since we are running the same Yammy what are the pro`s and con`s of SS versus the stock prop?  Thanks
157255,Pigeontroller,2008-02-04 21:15:00,2793,"I have always been in favour of Alum. over SS for the usual reasons, I fish and frequent shallow water alot. A friend who has a bigger boat and an Yamaha F150 recently stated that his boat felt gutless with an Alum. prop the one time he put one on...Got me wondering what my boat would be like with a SS prop!?"
