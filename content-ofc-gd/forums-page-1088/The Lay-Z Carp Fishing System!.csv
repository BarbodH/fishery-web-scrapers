157466,Victor,2008-02-05 03:34:00,1609,how much is shipping? ... i live in toronto.  can i get it in pink?
157469,irishfield,2008-02-05 03:45:00,26272,Hey Rich... grab the garbage while you're down there would yah!!  Nice couch SP !
157475,Rich,2008-02-05 04:07:00,3927,"Ha, I got the display version. It came with the model.  Was a fun day out on the Mighty Lynn! I am addicted to winter carp. Next thing to look forward to is spring channel cats!"
157481,HTHM,2008-02-05 04:39:00,4082,I don't think I want the yellow model   The invention is
157522,ccmtcanada,2008-02-05 12:38:00,7971,"LOL...great little invention there Sugarpacket!  Great to see you guys out there getting some winter carp.  My usual carp spot is too low right now, gotta hope the spring melt/rains makes it fishable in the spring.  Thanks for the report....you have a gift for writing them!"
157551,lazybum,2008-02-05 14:10:00,142,You are funny.      Make sure you filed your patent on it.  If you sell 1 million through those infomercials with Billy the Oxy clean guy and you get $5 profit for each then that's a cool $5 mill for you.  No more work - just sit back and catch carp everyday   . Rich could be the butler bringing drinks.  Nice post to start the day.
157556,fatherof3,2008-02-05 14:40:00,1769,great report and congrats on the fish
157562,Headhunter,2008-02-05 15:19:00,5703,"Wow, great idea!    Looks like a very good system you have there, however, I'm not to sure about the ""installer"" you have there, not really the ""trusting look"" most buyers are lookin for! HH"
157610,wolfville,2008-02-05 17:08:00,396,"I try not to think about carp at this moment, otherwise two more months will seem like a century.  Nice report and thanks for sharing."
157630,Jen,2008-02-05 17:51:00,833,You both look like you have an amazing time while out and about... either fishing or just enjoying the outdoors... there is nothing like making those smiles happen.  Nice fish too!  Cheers  Jen
