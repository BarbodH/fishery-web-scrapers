158622,wmshaw,2008-02-08 19:07:00,42,"I have called several operators on Lake Nipissing and Simcoe looking for a weekend booking for 2 people but cannot find anyone who will do less than 4 people for a weekend.  Does anyone know of an operator who will rent an ice bungalow on a per person basis for 2 people on a weekend?  Thanking you in advance,  Bill"
158624,tonyb,2008-02-08 19:17:00,1637,"I'm sure they will rent a bungalow to the two of you, but you'll be paying for 4.  Otherwise, why not just spend a night in a motel and fish 2 days renting huts?  Tony"
158625,wmshaw,2008-02-08 19:20:00,42,"Most of the operators do not even want four people but want 6 to 8 people.  I wanted to be on the lake ice fishing for the two days, otherwise I could rent a motel and shack."
158632,tonyb,2008-02-08 19:27:00,1637,Yeah I hear ya...I wanted to do the same thing before but it wasn't feasible.  Some of them said it might be possible if I booked during mid-week as opposed to the weekend...have you asked them about a mid-week option?
158633,steverowbotham,2008-02-08 19:30:00,1800,"Grump and Grumpy's on Nipissing has 4 man huts, we went up with 3 last weekend.  Although 4 is defneitely preferred, and a group of 4 would probably take priority"
