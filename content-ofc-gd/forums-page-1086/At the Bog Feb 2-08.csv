156904,joonmoon,2008-02-03 20:00:00,528,"My wife and I had booked a hut with Kerry (Scugog ice huts) for Sat. After the storm we had Fri wasn't sure if we were gonna make it or not but it finished and blew across Ont with just enuff time to clean it up before we left Sat morn. Got to Scugog and loaded up his sled and taxi'd to our home for the day by 1pm. A warm four-man hut to ourselves...sweet. Within minutes we were icing dink perch with the odd keeper.    Warmin up to the eve bite for walleye. When the sun set and the witching hour was upon us we were ready. The eye bite was slow, at one point I noticed my line and minnow twitched differently then it had been, I slowly lifted the rod out of the holder and felt weight, gave it a few seconds more and slammed the hook home. We were fishing in 6-8' right on top of a weedbed so I wanted to get it up quik so as not to wrap in the weeds and lose em as I did earlier with a decent perch. Just as it popped out of the hole the hook let go with a panic and a lightning quik reflex I had my first Scugog Walleye on the ice...Yippeee.  A couple more hours of nothing and we called it a day. Plan to eat em up yum for snaks later today....yummmmm. "
156907,tjsa,2008-02-03 20:19:00,1578,"Nice perch, walleye is good also, makes for a nice feed for sure, congrats on you're first Scucog walleye."
