158654,goby,2008-02-08 20:16:00,18,"Fish Story  A guy who lives at Round Lake, Sask.  (50 miles South of Yorkton ) saw a ball bouncing  around kind of strangely in the lake and went to  investigate.  It turned out to be a flathead catfish who had  obviously tried to swallow a basketball which  became stuck in its mouth!!  The fish was totally exhausted from trying to  dive, but unable to because the ball would  always bring him back up to the surface.  The guy tried numerous times to get the ball out,  but was unsuccessful. He finally had his wife cut  the ball in order to deflate it and release the hungry  catfish.  You probably wouldn't have believed this,  if you hadn't seen the following pictures...    "
