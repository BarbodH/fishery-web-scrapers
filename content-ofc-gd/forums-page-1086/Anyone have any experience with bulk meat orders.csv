158847,foggy,2008-02-09 14:01:00,38,"the hamilton NO FRILLS flyer has strip loin on for $3.99 lb (cut it yourself). it doesnt get much better than that. quality is AA or higher same as all large supermarkets. i usually buy a loin or 2 when this deal is on. their meat can be hit miss,but the same goes for most supermarkets"
158539,Gerritt,2008-02-08 13:26:00,6129,I purchase all my beef directly from the farmer. I order a animal and usually keep 1/4 - 1/2 for myself. I have done this for years as did my family. Always from the same farmer. I have yet to have a bad animal. His animals are free range for the most part and are not pumped full of the crap that you normally see in the grocery stores (Did you know the grocery stores add chemicals to the meat to make it look red and fresh? they do).. Once the animal is about 1-2 months away from slaughter the animal is fed corn. I believe this makes all the difference. I have yet to have a tough steak or roast.  I know it is good as my son can eat it with no allergy concerns... I cant feed him chicken and it is not because he is allergic to chicken he is allergic to the chemicals the commercial farmers inject into them.  It is good for my family and the family of the farmer. As we cut out the middle man (The Packer) I pay the farmer 2.00 per pound and the butcher gets .40 cents a pound. A packer would pay a farmer nowhere near to 2.00 a pound.  I support the farmer that supports my family with a quality product. He has people as far away as toronto coming to purchase his animals they are that good.  I would be hard pressed to even buy decent extra lean Ground Beef @ 2.40 a pound in the grocery store. So I save money and the farmer gets to put food on his table and support his.  Win Win.  G
158548,aniceguy,2008-02-08 14:02:00,1094,2.40 is a great price  Is the beef organic?  If so at that price its a steal
158552,Gerritt,2008-02-08 14:10:00,6129,"Yes, as far as I know there is nothing added to animal. Their feed is natural grasses etc.. I am unsure if antibiotics are used however I highly doubt it unless the animal is ill.. All I know is my son has no issues with it and average animal from him has a hanging weight of 500-700lbs. I pay 2.00 a lb on the hanging weight. The butcher then gets .40 a pound and a 70.00 kill fee.  I cant go wrong with the end product (better then anything I can buy) and the price suits my budget. I have another animal coming in the spring (End of May)  All animals are government inspected and stamped.  The butcher does a great job too.  G.  PS.. I may have a 1/4 left to sell......"
158584,The Provider,2008-02-08 16:15:00,11,"I agree totally with Gerritt, I just grabbed two whole strip loins and about 40 chicken breasts from a farmer buddy of mine and the steaks are outstanding and the chicken breats are huge and tender. I have been buying from him for about two years and the quality has been nothing less than 100%. It is all in the feed and the quality of the animal, I always know what I am getting and the price is amazing as well. this last bunch bunch I bought, the steaks were $2.20lb and the chicken breasts were $1.20lb. Two weeks ago I bought 7 top sirloin  steaks (Black Angus) about 2 inches thick from the Barn in Hamilton, cost me $78.00 and they were really disappointing, chewy was not the word. Worst part is I even marinated them for about 6 hours before cooking and they were still brutal.  Find yourself a farmer, you will not be disappointed!"
158594,bigbuck,2008-02-08 17:12:00,2449,"OOOOOOOOOOOO............ A topic close to my heart. I was a butcher working part time at Knob Hill Farms (remember the blue collar grocery chain??) going through high school and university. The biggest problem buying a bulk order of beef like that is whether or not you will use everything and how long it will take you to use it all. If you've got a big family, it might be worth it depending on whether or not they package everything exactly how you want it. The problem going directly to a farmer to get your beef is that it's not federally inspected (as opposed to provincially) when the butcher takes down the carcass? Is the butcher inspected??? I can tell you horror stories about provincially inspected packing plants. Federally inspected plants have to meet a much higher standard that provincially inspected plants. A lot can happen from the time your cow gets slaughtered till it gets packaged. My dad was the meat buyer for Knob Hill and part of his job was to inspect the packing plants the Knob used for suppliers. He was very picky on who he did business with. Too bad, since Knob Hill closed the doors, the price of beef has more than doubled in the grocery stores but on the production level (farmer's side), the price hasn't changed all that much. Knob Hill kept the big chains honest on their pricing."
158603,TroutnMuskieHunter,2008-02-08 17:44:00,1362,"We do the same as Gerritt does and buy a full side of beef from a buddy of mine that's a full-time farmer.....no complaints whatsoever!!  Most farmers will ask you what size of animal do you want...We prefer the younger animals because the steaks are smaller in size and we find the meat a little more tender.  The other beauty of ordering your own beef is that you get to choose the cuts that you want. My buddy gives me a printout with all the cuts of beef and also has a column to right down how thick you want your steaks cut, how many lbs you want your roasts to be, etc... and it's up to you to fill it out.....we don't like Blade steaks or Blade roasts so we get them to grind them into hamburg...it's amazing how many different cuts there are to choose from!!.....I have to go grab lunch, all this talk about beef is making me hungry!!  Support your local farmer and buy Canadian Beef"
158605,Badger Shark,2008-02-08 17:49:00,291,MMMMMMMMMMMMM STEAK!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  Thanks for making me extremely hungry : :  If I had the room I would be looking into this.
158608,douG,2008-02-08 18:17:00,2693,"I went shopping a few months ago for some fine steak.  I chose AAA Angus steaks from Longo's.  These were very nicely marbled, and delicious.  Cut em with a fork."
158609,Pinch,2008-02-08 18:21:00,231," I did a meat order from this place  http://www.blackangusmeat.com/index.php a couple of months ago and the meat is excellent.  It cost $700 and filled my entire full sized stand up freezer with steaks, roasts, chickens. ground beef, stir fry beef.....and on and on.  You get whatever cuts that you want, so you arent left with something you wont use.  Once I called them up and went to collect it, they threw in an extra 60lbs of goods for free.  Anything from the store that I wanted!  I though that their service and the quality of food was excellent.  Everything was double wrapped to save from freezer burn.  Pinch"
158668,Big Cliff,2008-02-08 21:06:00,6899,"Well, I fully believe in supporting our local farmers, got a few of them that I hunt with but buying a 1/4 side of beef (typically 150 or so lbs) is a lot for us since there are only the two of us. We don't do a lot of roasts so most of what we use are steaks, the odd pot roast, ground beef and occasionally in the summer some nice beef ribs. The butcher that we deal with (the guy that helps us with the saussages for the Tyler event) only deals with local farmers so we are supporting them indirectly. based on what some of you are saying, he sure is expensive though, strip loins for $4.99 a lb, I wouldn't even think of making any kind of a change, his quality is excellent but I pay a lot more than that!"
158683,bigbuck,2008-02-08 21:50:00,2449,"Cliff, 4.99/lb for strips, that's a pretty good price, they are in excess of 10 bucks/lb in the big chain stores. If you are happy with your butcher, AND his shop and cutting room are CLEAN, stick with him."
