158807,Mike the Pike,2008-02-09 05:25:00,3421,Yup I here ya Lew it seems they are staring to compete for ratings .I enjoy the shows that give you tips on how to improve your fishing.  Not the music.  Although my new boat comes with a stereo it will be played when the boat is wide open.When I am fishin yes it will be turned off or be very low if I am trolling.  If the electric motor is on I will be listening to just mother nature.
158858,Crazyhook,2008-02-09 15:24:00,1154," Sounds like a plan, you make sure to bring your favorite big rubber bait"
158919,Clampet,2008-02-09 21:22:00,1947,"How about Shania, Lew? Would you tend to turn it up, just a tad?"
158923,lew,2008-02-09 21:41:00,12767,"There are exceptions to every rule Jed, and there will always be a spot in my boat for Shania, even if I have to toss Crazyhook out"
158993,Crazyhook,2008-02-10 01:44:00,1154,I would dive out of the boat for that Lew...

158684,irishfield,2008-02-08 21:51:00,26272, I've got a long way to go yet Rich !  Note my choice of music..... got a spare hat?
158234,Moosebunk,2008-02-07 16:34:00,3970,"I turn the channel when I see people fishing bass.  Funny thing is, a number of shows that seem to have the loud music have guys fishing bass.  Perfect.  I actually really like fishing bass though, just not watching it on TV.  I don't mind so much any loud music in shows... what's a turn-off is if the whole thing reeks of WWE/WWF attitude with show hosts coming across as fish slaying thugs who fish like it's all for the world title or sumthin.'  But whatever."
