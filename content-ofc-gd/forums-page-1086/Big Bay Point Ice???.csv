159026,tapout,2008-02-10 03:34:00,166,Just wondering if the conditions around big bay point are safe.  I will be walking out.  tapout
159027,Joey,2008-02-10 03:35:00,9122,I don't think that's a very good idea Tony.  Joey
159028,tapout,2008-02-10 03:38:00,166,"thanks Joey.  Any other ideas for lakers, whities?   I've still to catch my first ever  either one of them.  If not then I guess its perch."
159035,Joey,2008-02-10 03:52:00,9122,"Ya, another week or two of cold weather, otherwise, Haliburton is your best bet right now.  Joey"
159058,Big Cliff,2008-02-10 09:04:00,6899,"Be careful even if you are heading up to Haliburton, I heard on the news last night that there are three snowmobliers missing. they were saying that there are still many dangerous areas. Be safe!"
159062,Vanselena,2008-02-10 10:37:00,269,A couple of guys from another board I frequent mentioned they walked out of Oro and both broke through. Good thing for them they were only in 5 feet of water.
159065,Shelley Cooper,2008-02-10 10:45:00,394,Hey Tabout... Bigchev and I took a trip to BBP yesterday.... The ice is good but the slush an snow amounts for walking are just crazy... Very tough walking.. and sinking into the slush made keeping your balance very difficult...  Only seen or heard of herring being caught in the area....  You won't see me out there again till it all freeze's up....
159071,rhare,2008-02-10 12:04:00,387,Lots of ice on BBP ppl driving sleds and Buggys. SLUSH is too deep to ride anything right now untill it freezes. Even hard to walk out for the most fit. Watch those northern lakes they have had lots of snow very inconsistant up there.
159078,dheitzner,2008-02-10 13:23:00,314,"echoing troutguy, lots of ice in that area(8-10""); it's the slush that makes it tough.  few huts out, lots of sleds and quads.  caught tons of lakers and a few whities this year.  people are catching herring but they are waayyy up in the water column between 10' & 30'.  all of my fish have came within 15' of bottom so far."
