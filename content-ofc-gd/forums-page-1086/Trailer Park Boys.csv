158757,richyb,2008-02-09 01:40:00,774,Hey .. i watch it on showcase and no bleeping ... but anytime i watch it is after 9 pm .. maybe they have to beep it before a certain time .. incase the kids happen to see it
158758,bassman,2008-02-09 01:40:00,384,It's bleeped in the afternoon and uncut after 9:00pm.  I hope that answers your bleeping question.

Ricky: By tasting, you moron. Regular tastes sour, supremium tastes a little tangy and diesel actually tastes pretty good."
158765,holdfast,2008-02-09 01:49:00,1813,Hey that makes sense here since I saw it a 7.  I guess Ill toon in after 9 if that the case as it was bleeping painful to watch.  After a layoff from the show I figure Ill catch up.  Awesome show especially being Canadian.  love that J ROCK.
