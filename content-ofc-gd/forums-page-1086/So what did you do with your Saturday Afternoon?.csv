159009,Dondorfish,2008-02-10 02:43:00,1000,   I was just gonna ask the same question.  Don
159017,irishfield,2008-02-10 03:16:00,26272, From my materials pile along the East wall of my shop!  * * * *  Seriously... I buy my sheet UHMW from P&A plastics in Hamilton.  Another spot is in vineland.. Polyzone  http://www.polyzone.com
159019,Garyv,2008-02-10 03:21:00,547,"Had a wonderful day that started last night.  Put some new ball valves and junctions on a hot water heater in one of our apts. as the old valve was leaking and water was dripping down to the first floor commercial business.  While in the apt unclogged all the drains, new washers in the taps, and lastly and bled all the air ( the unit only had about 20% water in it ) off one of the 2 radiators.  Still have one more but may call a plumber as the previous tenant did me a favour and reefed the flow through valve off so tightly that the stem snapped at the knob."
159030,Landlocked,2008-02-10 03:41:00,171,"COME ON FOLKS!!  NOBODY NOTICED THE ""AIR AMERICA"" POSTER IN THE FIRST PIC??!?!  bwah, ha, ha, ha, ha.....only a fellow pilot would have the cojones to bring that up eh?"
159032,irishfield,2008-02-10 03:46:00,26272,"My all time favourite Andy... I can watch that over and over again. ""You're gonna land WHERE?.. Please don't do this!"""
159034,Landlocked,2008-02-10 03:49:00,171,I completely get it
159036,irishfield,2008-02-10 03:53:00,26272,"""Anything higher than 3600 feet around here?""... ""Give me the orange crayon""...""Guys...is there anything higher than 3600 feet around here....."""
159055,OhioFisherman,2008-02-10 06:25:00,6623,"LOL Wayne, nice work, nice tools! Here is a link http://www.hgrindustrialsurplus.com/ dream on?  With all the companies that have closed, moved out of this area there is a lot of cool stuff sitting around!"
159056,Garry2Rs,2008-02-10 07:51:00,1425,"Hooked up the air conditioner, it's starting to go above 80F inside the trailer in the afternoons. Stayed home because there was a Bass tournament on the lake today. Did some laundry, and watched fishing shows that I had recorded on the DVR. It's great to be able to fast forward through the commercials...grin I really like the new ""Bass Pros"" show sponsored by Bass Pro Shop...I hope you guys are getting it up north."
159068,solopaddler,2008-02-10 11:38:00,8605,"WTG MacGyverfield, nice job!"
159085,Beans,2008-02-10 13:59:00,3339,"Great work Wayne...If I may make a suggestion:  A third tent pole in the other back end corner would allow you to wrap the tarp around a bit more and give you a bit more protection from the wind...  but, then again...what do I know..."
158925,irishfield,2008-02-09 21:51:00,26272,"I got out of my wife's hair.. went out to the shop and turned a fishing show on.    I then got to thinking that part of the issue with Ron having to pull me around thru the slush last year was that my cutter was freezing in...so I went to work on fixing that problem. Cut some UHMW....    Bent it to fit the shape of the cutter's skis...    Checked it for fit..    and then got down to work attaching it to the skis..        Then after I'd checked what the weather looks like for this coming Friday... -28C and 10k wind.. BURRR..... with a little ""Jed"" inspiration I got to work on that as well. I had grabbed a bundle of tent bars from the garbage a few years back... as you never know when you're gonna need a spare.. and amongst them were the perfect parts to make the posts and a self locking spreader bar. Total cost of this ""upgrade"".... $6 for the tarp at Home Depot. It's not going to withstand a gale... but it should cut down on the wind chill and give a spot to pitch the chair out of the wind if I park in the right spot!  Drilled holes in the cutter deck so the posts go down and sit in the ski channels.      Drilled holes in each end of the self locking ""spreader bar"" so it not only tightens the tarp... it hold the tarp down on the post pegs as well.    A few bungee cords here and there and we're good to go...      Ohhh.. and just to make it a fishing post... we'll be after these..  "
158926,trapshooter,2008-02-09 21:56:00,1234,Jeez Wayen... I went skiing and I thought I was productive.  Nice work!
158927,irishfield,2008-02-09 21:58:00,26272,That's what I should be doing... still haven't used my ski pass this season.
158928,Joeytier,2008-02-09 22:00:00,3990,"I spent my afternoon on here. Good forum, but still depressing."
158929,trapshooter,2008-02-09 22:01:00,1234,Today I hit 43 days on the mountain.  Not too bad for a fishing guide!  Sorry to take this OT
158932,lew,2008-02-09 22:04:00,12767,"I built a pair of extension arms for my mitre saw today Wayne, but their not near as snazzy as your new ski's & Jed Tent."
158937,Spiel,2008-02-09 22:32:00,9065,"....Sheeesh it sure would be nice to have a big work shop at my disposal. Looks like you'll be all set for Temagami Wayne.  I spent my afternoon shopping at Fishing World for a few new things I wanted for tomorrows trip. I'm taking the young lads and the GF up to Simcoes east shore for some perch and whitefish action, I hope. Rented a 6 man hut and we'll get chauffeured out in the ole ""bambadier"". I think they'll all enjoy that.  "
158938,ecxstriper,2008-02-09 22:34:00,343,"I put sheet rock up  in a friends basement, but I like your day better Wayne"
158939,Rizzo,2008-02-09 22:35:00,4754,I went fishing!  Went to the Barrie marina and caught absolutely nothing for an hour and a half of trying.  Spoke to some people who had been there much longer with nothing or 1 or 2 dinks to show for it.
158941,danc,2008-02-09 22:37:00,4677,Geez. A Brown Boggs shear and is that a Tennsmith break? I make my living with those things. Nice work Wayne.
158943,irishfield,2008-02-09 22:51:00,26272,"Na.. it's a good 'ol made in Hamilton Brown Boggs as well Dan. Also have a 12' Wysong 18 gauge shear and a 12' Chicago brake. You can never have too many ""right"" tools !"
158946,danc,2008-02-09 23:01:00,4677,"Actually Wayne, the shear that I use at work these days will cut 3/8 inch mild steel and the press will break 3/4 inch hard plate. Cool stuff.."
158947,Bernie,2008-02-09 23:01:00,3190,Looks like a great way to pass a day Wayne. Better than sitting on yer butt. Went with my cousin Jim today to remove a large poplar that the beavers had chewed(likely before freeze up) and toppled over on the roof of his cottage. Caused quite a bit of damage. Figure it will be well over 10K. A rafter split but held. After a quickkie patch over several holes branches had put through we headed over to my place. Patched up a broken window. Wind and nature is hard on places out there.
158950,Hookset,2008-02-09 23:18:00,367,Moving in 3 weeks...packing...wanna go fishing...packing...checking out OFC...packing...getting yelled at 'cuz I ain't doing enough...packing.  God someone please save me. I have too much crap...packing...packing.  I think I just packed my beer   Hookset.
158951,irishfield,2008-02-09 23:21:00,26272,LOL Hookset.. not good.  Bernie.. thanks for the reminder.. almost forgot to pack the chain saw for the trip North. Got 5 guys to push...so time for a tree to come down before it ends up on our roof.
158953,ccmtcanada,2008-02-09 23:26:00,7971,"Sweet work Wayne!  I brought a new treadmill up the stairs (that I put together last night), loaded into the CRV, and returned it to the store because the incline feature wasn't working.  I then brought a new unit home, pu it together and did a quick 15 minute workout to try it all out.  Oh yeah...jammed for 2 hours this morning with the band too."
158954,danbouck,2008-02-09 23:32:00,4380,Cleaned out the work truck... OFC.... followed by an extrememly good dinner at the keg for the wife's birthday!

158978,Whopper,2008-02-10 00:54:00,2174,"I did a side job today to pad the fishing account, got enough back log to pay for the first few months of the new season.  Even earned some brownie points hanging some new curtains   Nice work Wayne."
