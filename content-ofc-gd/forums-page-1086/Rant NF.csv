158362,JustinHoffman,2008-02-07 22:40:00,482,"One thing we probably have to ask ourselves is why a ""rant"" thread receives 2,371 views and 103 responses? Don't think a fishing report has ever garnered that much interest in this sites existence...hey, I guess we all like to rant.  Sadly, the official ""Fishing for Tyler"" thread has only received 4 responses and 572 views - go figure...  Don't worry, Cliff - there will be a new ""rant"" of some sort posted tomorrow, whether it be about a lousy fishing store, loud music, rod warranties, or the weather. Perhaps we need a ""rant"" section on this site, so we don't have to wade through them all...(tongue in cheek comment there.)  Good Fishing, Justin"

158387,Gerritt,2008-02-07 23:38:00,6129,"While I made a post on this subject expressing my opinion, I think publicly attacking Roy is/was uncalled for.... as for charity... I know all too well the level to which OFC'rs give... it is unbelievable to say the least... I know it as do Shelly and Cliff etc etc etc...  To sit there and publicly attack Roy is wrong in my opinion... as I know first hand he has helped so many here. He did not need too, but he did what he could for what he though was right.  for those of you attacking him shame on you.  G."
158471,holdfast,2008-02-08 02:42:00,1813,"Click Click Click, This is really amusing.  I don't know anybody from a hole in the ground, although Roy has moderated me a few times, even Gag ordered, But at Least the Last Time he had the decency to give me a good PM when a Wuss( no names-no pack drill) called me a name but cowardly never answered my Pm after it got locked.  As long as I have lived, kids for all kinds of Organizations went door to door or stood at key locations to bring in money that public funds wont pay.  You name it, from hockey excursions to boy scouts and girl guide cookies.  But call it Panhandling, I think not.  I thought Roy was going to talk about Squeegee kids or some young guy with 2 legs and 2 arms asking for money.  Loved it two weeks ago when I went to the Liquor store and two Losers asked me for Money.  I unloaded on them like a Drill Sgt and told them that I worked hard for my money and I wasn't giving any to anybody especially them.  That's a Panhandler.  But Kids, I'm not sorry by saying that I don't agree with Roy or others on his original thread.  I agree with what Kirk has said, including the St Roy comment, because it sure looks like it.  Just say no to the kids, give out Mcdonalds applications to the lazy non disabled, or unload on the Welfare Bums that hang out near the liquor store.  I hope this thread never ends because, really, its amusing.  I really like the Mcdonalds applications.  Good one. Can anybody tell me how to get rid of the telemarketers because I dont have time to individually go through Cyber space to cancel, especially if I keep getting new ones."
158489,Joey,2008-02-08 03:28:00,9122,"Now this is exactly why I rarely get involved in threads that go this way.  Things get taken way out of context.  What I was trying to say Kirk, was that I believe the general rule is that if you have something unkind to say about another member of this board, you should take it to PM instead of openly flaming someone. I know you say you were not flaming, but it certainly seems like a personal attack on Roy.  You say it is not, but as they say, if it looks like a duck.... well, you know the rest.  It should have gone to PM long ago.  Joey"
158493,Vanselena,2008-02-08 03:41:00,269,"Personally I like the idea that the kids have to go out and earn a trip or whatever it is they want to be involved in. I think kids today get too easily a free pass and if it means selling chocolates or whatever then it helps them build character.  There are also alot of kids out there that have parents that cannot afford to pay for their childs sports, does that mean a child should suffer? Let them sell chocolates and learn what it means to work for what they want."
158495,douG,2008-02-08 04:00:00,2693,"OK, it sounds like it is time for me to stand and be counted.  Alright, I agree with some of you, but not everybody.  OK?  We ALL HATE ROY, but we all have our own reasons, and we can never agree on exactly what those reasons are.  I think we should all just decide amongst ourslefs that we don't like him, and leave it at that. I won't be talking to him any time soon, that's for sure."
158505,Cookslav,2008-02-08 04:50:00,1457,"...nice You know the the only thing I hate more then Roy....kids! They are all money grubbing PANHANDLERS  looking for a free ride! EVERY Single one of them.  Think about it.... First they expect you to feed them & Wipe their butt for a few years then next thing you know its sports, clothes, tuition and trips to Europe! And then if that wasn't enough they want more money towards their wedding, and they might even ask you to buy their own bratty kids gifts on their birthday... Its no wonder these other parents send the kids out onto the street to begg for cash donations. They have to save for retierment some how right?  mmmm...wait a minute! I have kids too! Better pick out a good spot at the mall now before the other parents get it first LOL!!!!  Hey? Do I have to buy the other kids chocolate bars if I'm asked while I'm supervising my Kids selling theirs?  And if the other Kids are rude, do I still need to be polite? mmmm....to many rules, think I'll just stay home"
158509,Tybo,2008-02-08 06:55:00,1373,"Only thing I disagree about,is the fact how many people are rich. Do to  white collar society givings in charitable donations."
158523,brickNblock,2008-02-08 12:15:00,598,"Exellent..... Didnt think I was going to get in my .02 before the lock down. If a child showed up at my door with a box or some other money holding object asking for a donation for sports, education or a school event/trip....... I'd pretty much say NO thanks and shake my head in disgust... perhaps even a ""..If I gave you money ...I wouldnt be able to go"" On the other hand...If they, when finished their sales spiel then told me. they would be willing to shovel my driveway or cut my grass or wash my truck for any donation towards their cause I would have no problem throwing them a $20...maybe even a $50. We've successfully raised 6 of our own children who all know the value of a buck... There are far too many of other peoples children out there who expect something for nothing.......and they havent been taught the value of work=earnings.......No work, No earnings....including at home. Firefighters.........on their international fundraising day sometimes I feel swarmed and it can be bloody inconvienient but It does put a smile on my face when my turn to roll the window down and give because of the respect I hold for what the firefighters do for a living and their great cause for MD. Roy is not a saint.......neither is any one else here.....But I do know that Roy is a charitable fella to a HUGE extent and that (IMO) most likely wouldnt have said what he did that seems to have upset you Kirk, Matt etc.... if the child had something to offer instead of just asking......something for nothing.......... Im sorry....but a sports event or school reason doesnt cut it. I believe you have made an error by comment and are showing Ill colours of a personality and most on this board are jumping in as protection of another OFC'r.  I wouldnt reply either again if i were Roy because it has become quite apparent it does not matter what he says to you it will be deemed incorrect/arogant/nasty or other. Dont include me in no parade because that comment is not warranted.....Not to anyone. The only saints i know are my parents and my wife....... OK...Lock'r down now captain!"
158526,Spiel,2008-02-08 12:25:00,9065,"  ....Okay, but only cause there's far to much for me to read before going to bed, it's been a long night."
158288,Joey,2008-02-07 19:10:00,9122," Well I don't think you're being accurate at all.  I thought flamers got banned?  I see absolutely no need for the insults you are throwing Kirk.  Roy wasn't rude to anyone as you stated, he simply asked if anyone had noticed a rise in the number of children/youths looking for handouts at popular stores and on city streets/intersections.  Joey"
158293,muskymatt,2008-02-07 19:23:00,2608,"  I'm not critizing Roy, he has a right to his own opinion and as voiced here some agree some do not.  But to clarify.....he was rude, as he admitted himself.  Maybe he was just having a bad day, we all have them."
158308,Hookset,2008-02-07 19:52:00,367,"  See,... whether we all agree or not, each person has something worthwhile to add. I loved the above quote and I plan on stopping at McD's on the way home. Even though I've never seen a Squeegie Kid up here I wanna be ready.  Now if we can all just add our opinions, while keeping things civil, all should be well in our wee fishing world.  By the way...have you ever heard the one about the Midget with a hair lip that goes to buy a horse ?    Hookset."
158310,shane,2008-02-07 20:00:00,652, oooooh.............that was a low blow.   but a good one
158345,Kirk,2008-02-07 21:58:00,347,"Wasn't flaming Joey, I suggest contacting TJ, maybe he can ban anyone you disagree with.  Does this mean I am kicked out of the St. Roy parade committee?  :)  Thanks Muskymatt, why let facts spoil an excellent argument LOL"
158349,Cory,2008-02-07 22:12:00,170,"Some people on this board think Roy is a saint and can do no wrong.  Others think he may be the biggest flamer going here.  Some people think Roy adds a lot to the board experience, others feel he is nothing but a shill for certain muskie guides and those associated with them.  Some people think Roy is unbiased and fair, other feel he plays favorites all of the time.  This is a message board.  This rant is no different than the volume of music or type of music on a fishing show, price of a GPS at a fishing store, service at a Crappy Tire…..garbage left by fisherman….Leafs suck…etc.  Everyone has there own point of view on things.  I won’t get into mine on this one."
158351,cisco,2008-02-07 22:20:00,597,"I agree with Kirk. Can't believe I said that! Old Apel is bang on in my view. I think it's easy to say 'no thank you' instead of saying something that widens the 'generation gap' to foster disrespect.  We oldsters and our system is what shaped the 'me' society of today, and youngsters are salespersons as we were and we are alla time!!!  Everything we do is sales-related.... job hunting... searching for bargains, sex, fame, fortune, fish, friendships... it all involves sales. Selling ourselves is what humans do to GET THEIR WAY.  I don't for sure know what Roy does involving kids, but a pal up north runs a community home and he gets money from gov't to do it. He's always shopping for food deals to maximize profits as any good business does. If Roy does that same kinda thing, fine, but I'm not sure what pedestal he'd sit on. I never hear Roy tooting his own horn or showing us pics of him standing on a pedistal, so anybody doing it for him shouldn't unless you know he doesn't run a community home as a business.  Roy may very well be embarrassed by folks trying to be his spokespersons incorrectly.   Let him explain himself his work/job/business/? to help the underprivileged.... don't be a self-appointed spokesperson promoting what you don't understand. Roy's a nice guy. So is the head of the Red Cross who gets hundreds of thousands of $$$ per year salary. But I don't think anyone sees the Red Cross money maker as God's gift to people needing blood.  Roy has a valid point about not enjoying youngsters frequently asking for donations/sales for their causes. It surely can be bothersome/uncomfortable for us oldsters at times. But we should always treat others with respect regardless of their age or social status.  We oldsters should really be doing something productive instead of picking on youngsters. Maybe get on Gov'ts case for breaking their promise years ago.... REMEMBER FOLKS?????   Gov't was gonna use lottery loot to improve social programs... ice arenas, wheelchair ramps, etc..  They started lotteries and did some good stuff, then changed things so the loot became part of the tax base. Think of what that money coulda done to help youth and sports and disadvantaged/disabled Canadians?  If lottery $$ was used to help the disadvantaged and youth sports, we'd have a great nation of sports opportunities where youngsters had sports to pursue instead of other activities we oldsters don't cotton to.  We oldsters created the shape of youngsters so let's not complain... let's enjoy the fruits of our collective failures and broke gov't promises... enjoy when youngsters ask you for money or to buy a candy bar."
158355,Big Cliff,2008-02-07 22:28:00,6899,"I'd really like to ask that this thread be locked. I truly think it has run it's course, everyone that has wanted to contribute has had their chance to do so and express their opinion. I doubt that anymore good can come from it and before it gets totally out of hand I feel it's time to put it to bed.  Please!"
157968,Kirk,2008-02-06 17:17:00,347,"Hey Terry,  I buy my kids stuff as well, only because he's not at the age yet that he can sell stuff on his own and when that time comes, I'll buy the chocolates as well, cause I wouldn't want some ______ to bad mouth him,  BUT like I said, a smile and no thanks works just as well, as opposed to getting off on 'winning' an argument with a child or insulting and name calling kids with slurs like 'panhandler', thats classless, makes you wonder who has the brains, the kid or the 'adult'.  And I don't see the difference between a kid asking for you to buy a chocolate bar and posting the same sort of request on a message board.  Same sentiment and it might result in the same 'panhandling' slur by other's.  I guess what it comes down to is being able to politely interact with children...and if ya can't...just smile and nod (most anyone should be able to do that without ranting LOL)  This threads a joke anyway based on the initial content...  FYI I'm a proud conservative party member, I just don't feel the need to put down kids to make myself feel superior."
157975,Terry,2008-02-06 17:30:00,14456,LOL ..I don't bad mouth the kids....as most don't and I see that as part of the problem I believe it is why the Jehovah witness  now bring kids with them most times when knocking at doors...because people will restrain themselves when kids are around.......... but when I say no thanks and the kid gives the pouty look and says ah come on don't you like kids and what not..that is too much and it is that kind of begging I don't like.....  and it's not just kids in my books  here in Bradford the fire department bocked off the main road and had big firemen boots held out to the cars to get a donation....I was 15 minutes late for an appointment because of them.....how dare they......................
157978,lew,2008-02-06 17:45:00,12767," Terry, Fire Fighters across North America have been raising funds to fight musclar dystrophy for decades and have raised millions upon millions of dollars to fight the disease and are historically the largest fund raiser of any other organization.  It's something the firemen across the continent  took on a long time ago and they will  go on soliciting funds until the disease is conquered.  Sorry you were late for work because of it, but I figured if you knew the probable reason for the delay, you wouldn't feel so angry.  Now if they were raising money for a hocky game, that's a different story  And BTW, I agree with you about the Jehovas Witnessess and their tag-along kids !!"

157982,capt bruce,2008-02-06 18:19:00,820,"Kirk I never said I call the kids panhandlers (tho I agree  that what this amounts to )I am allways polite when I turn down their requests . When my children got older I did incourge them to earn their own money , BY WORKING FOR IT . I dont think this selling of things AS WORK and would NEVER ALLOW my child to do it . Why do you think its so easy for some kids today to just park them selves on the sidewalk and beg . Matbe Its because I work at KING and JOHN streets and have to step over people to get into the building to go to work that makes me so jaded . but its like we have become a society of BEGGERS everyone has his hand out for this for that me me me give me some give me some , buy my newspaper its for a good cause buy my choclate , give give give. HOw is it that i raised four children and lived these 57 years WITHOUT ASKING ANYONE TO buy give whatever !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"

157985,Kirk,2008-02-06 18:24:00,347,"If you can dish it out you should be able to take it.  I stand by the accuracy of my opinion.  There's just too many 'adults' trashing kids these days, without justification.  And why would you think I'm in a bad mood when I'm just enjoying what I'm doing???

That is one reason that schools are sending out the troops to canvass.  If you ever remember doing this sort of thing as a kid, you know that they are working hard for all money that they raise.  I choose to support them and encourage the things they are doing with the small amount of money they raise."
157994,Jason Vernooy,2008-02-06 19:23:00,25,"There is nothing wrong with a hockey team doing something civic minded...raking leaves, shovelling snow... when they have these chocolate drives the only winner is the orginal chocolate maker.  Many ""charitiable organization have executive directors making big momney for little effort. The school system is a joke......the  education system thinks that they need to provide a program for special needs students.  These programs are often based in core schools, where parenting is suspect at best and home discpline is never thought of.   If the education system where to clean up its act, and have the guts to place some of the accountablilty back on the parents, several, not all, of these programs could be discontinued, resulting in extra gov't funding for other organizations By the way, many call centres, ie. Shirner, Firefighters, Police services, Circus telemarketers are able to retain 45% of any thing they sell.  Always be careful with them"

157686,Kirk,2008-02-05 20:56:00,347,"Everyone has a cause Roy...  Surprised to see you ranting on this because OFC (and you in particular) have your causes that you don't mind promoting.  Kids sports is just as worthy as some of the other causes I've seen here, without getting into it further. (Tyler's event being a separate event as it is extremely worthy)  I see a kid fundraising and I give whatever change I got...or more of a donation for groups I am familiar with...calling kids panhandlers is totally uncalled for, especially when it could be applied to some 'cause of the day' who are adults, which you might take offense to as its your pet project.  Whats a 7 year old supposed to do, incorporate a company and sell shares...they sell chocolate.  If a kids sports tournament is in a remote location, there will be kids in the group that may not be able to afford the trip, or there may be adult volunteers that donate their time and should not be expected to also dip into their own funds to supervise these kids.  A smile and a no thanks also works.  Yours truly,  Dad"

My children MY RESPONSEABLITY , they do and go where we can afford and Im sorry Matt but they dont hang around malls , and its not because someone bought a cholate bar . Its because I make sure they have an interesting life and NO ONE HAS TO DONATE crap so I can do this . SORRY but thats the way I see it .."

I  never had the gov. pay for daycare or give money back for it..now that my kids are gone they do and I am paying for it..thats bull too..
157696,muskymatt,2008-02-05 21:19:00,2608,Kids should be given every opportunity to be involved in as much in their short childhood as they can.  And as long as I 've been on this earth fundraising has been a part of being a kid...bottle drives...carwashes....chocolate bars...etc.  Wheather it be because of lack of funding or no money at home they should still get the opportunity to be involved who cares what the reason is.  It's beyond me the comment about someone else raising/supporting having responsibitily for someone elses kids....come on were talking about a couple bucks now and then so a kid can do something constructive and be involved.  I went in Macdonalds and got a bunch of job applications that I hand out to squeegee kids and you should see the sneers I get.  Sometimes I offer them a job cleaning up at my job site and they say no....these people will never get a dime from me ...but a kid who wants to have a couple bucks for a group endevor...I'll give every time.  And I never once think I'm raising someone elses kids

I play on this multi-player game where there is alot of age 10-15 year olds who play.....I have never seen such a disrespectful bunch of kids, my daughter who is 26 plays on there and she will say, Mom if i ever did that you would have stunted my growth.....  The point is these kids think you need to just give it to them, and furthermore my Husband has an onsite computer business and he said that he hears kids cussing and screaming at there parents alot....whoaaaaaaaaaa.......China bound when I dug the hole for you @#$%!!!!!

Being a small business owner sure gives you lots of perspective on this as we are bombarded with charity requests, sponsorships etc. We've decided to keep the $$ local and have the same outlook with our personal contributions.  Ask some of those ""volunteers"" where they're from and you'll be surprised with the answers."
157706,ecmilley,2008-02-05 21:52:00,2163,"The only charity i give to is the salvation army, as far as i am concerned they actually help people. As for school fundraising that's a tough call, i do get tired of the door knockers and getting hasseled outside the beer/liqour store, ct and the grocery store, but i am an adult an simple NO suffices without causing me any problems. I remember doing skate-a-thons and run-o-thons and various other charitable events as a kid for heart and stroke, terry fox and such and they were good causes to get involved in, but for the most part i don't remember having to fund raise for the school to play hockey or go on a trip, usualy paid out of my own pockets (ok my parents pockets) to do these activities. I pay enough taxes now, where does all the money go? it just seems like everytime the goverment increases funding the teachers then the caretakers go on strike to claim the extra funds anyway."
157793,fishforfun,2008-02-06 02:20:00,105,"Good topic Roy and I hear you! Having been a volunteer in minor sports for over 32 yrs now I see a different side. A 10 yr old player who has what it takes to be there but the parents don't, do I cut him? Sports, hockey in particular are very expensive the kids good, the parents are broke? My teams fundraise but I find garage sales and dances etc more  appropriate. When you watch Canada at the world juniors believe me 1or 2 have been helped along the way. So the kid with $200 Nikes may think he's helping himself but really he's helping his team mate, a reality that we don't want kids to know, rich and poor are adult problems not something that kids need to be reminded of the ones with no money are struggling enough."

I almost never give to kids knocking on my door or those who are waiting for me at the entrance of what seems like nearly every store I approach.  You just have to pick & choose who or what you want to support and then basically cut it off after that point or you'll have your hand in your pocket most of the day....in Toronto anyways.  As for squeegee kids, street people, whiners, beggers and bums.....nope, nada, ziltch"

Don't get me wrong I contribute what I can to my charities of choice, but out and out begging I have a problem with.  My kids are grown and gone and we now ""contibute"" to our grandkids sports funds etc., but, for many years we were involved in competitive soccer for both my daughter and my son. We raised funds for tournaments, bags, tracksuits etc by running bingo's in smoke choked halls from midnight Saturday until 4.00am Sunday.  I do buy apples from cub scouts and cookies from girl guides and I buy a $10 poppy every November.  Last year I was fed up of not only the store entrance brigade, but the constant telephone and door to door canvasing. I decided to keep track of what I ran into day to day. It is February 4th and I have already had 8 door to door and over a dozen on the phone.

Apparently the kids are discouraged from going door to door because of abduction fears but this just forces then to go from shop to shop in my town. All these kids just gaggle up by mall entrances and home depot exits... The other day one of the kids handed me a piece of paper and it said that our school district was raising money for new classroom maps! Apparently some of them still have East and West Germany on them!!! The Democratic party has already spent over 100 million dollars on their election campaigns and the kids in my school district have to sell chocolate raisins to figure out why Russia doesn't look the same when they look it up on the Internet.  Allocation of funds seems to be misdirected on both sides of the border :/ It's not always a bad thing these kids are doing.  Ric"
157512,Big Cliff,2008-02-05 11:57:00,6899,"Sue and I have a simple solution: Every year we sit down and work out a budget and part of that budget includes what we feel we can comfortably afford to give to worthy causes. We have a few that always make the top of the list. One of our favorites is that every year at Christmas time we go to the local womens shelter and adopt a family for Christmas. They supply us with the number of people and gender of any kids and approxamate ages. We then go shopping and pick up everything they need to have a full blown Christmas dinner and a gift for each of the kids We usually put a gift card in for mom too and always include a card with a bit of cash just in case we missed something.  We deliver it to the shelter a day or two before Christmas and they arrange to get it to the family. We never know who the family is, and they never know who we are but there is no better feeling (for us anyway) than when we sit down to our christmas dinner someone else is going to have a much better Christmas than they might have.  The Salvation Army is another one that always gets something. Many years ago I found myself stranded in Sudbury with no money and no job. They fed me and gave me a place to sleep. A few days later I found work but money was still tight; they rented me a room for $10.00 a week and gave me my meals (even packed me a lunch) until I could get back on my feet. All I needed was a hand and they were there for me (I'll never forget it)!  We have a few others that we always try to help and if anyone else asks we just tell them ""we have already donated what we can afford this year"". As for kids coming to the door selling things..... well I'm all for kids putting some effort into trying to do things so if we can and want to; we do support them.  Works for us anyway!"
157514,Rich Clemens,2008-02-05 12:13:00,3131,Very admiral Big Cliff on your Christmas giving.  The world needs a lot more like you and I'll bet you get back far more than you give.

During that time between school events and sports fundraiser's we always had our hands in our pockets for something.  To each his own but I have always thought that getting your kids to beg for money was a classless thing to do, and it does put people on the spot. So mine NEVER EVER did it. If they where selling tickets we would buy a whole book ourselves...and never won a dang thing...chocolates...buy a whole dang box of bars...at least you got something outta that. Whatever extra we had to pony up came from our pockets, we never ever asked strangers...or co workers for money to support our kids."
