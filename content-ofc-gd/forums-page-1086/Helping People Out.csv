I think a fly in trip will give you and your dad all the serenity and peace of mind that you need. Ill tell ya its absolutely breathtaking up there. Ive got a couple of maps from lee with a couple of his honey hole lakes on them. Ill look for them and let ya know the names of the lakes. One of the lakes has monster pike the other is great for walleye. I wanted to tell ya make sure your prepared. Guys get stranded on them lakes alot. Everytime our group goes guys are stranded. Im not saying that it will happen but take plenty of provisions in case. Yeah Lee is a huckster but he has given my group all the respect that he can give. Best of luck like i said. If i can help make your trip better let me know."
