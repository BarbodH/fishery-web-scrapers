My self I had one light pick up, and when I set the hook, I got two turns of the reel and it was gone. Got baited up again, when one of the local, arrive to phish for a while, as we talked for a while, he told us of one he lost during the week, at the hole, says it was a very large Trout, and when he tried to gaff it the hook snapped on him. As we were talking I noticed my left rod waving in the air, looked to the right and just gabbed my right rod just before, it went down the hole, thought it was a biggie, line was peeling out, and it wasn't coming in, then I realized, my drag was too loose, so I tighten it up and put this sweet 161/4"" on ice    Not to be out done by us visitors, our old buddy, Warren, lands this feisty fella  That seem to be it for us, I had 2 more hits during the day, marked bait phish up and down the water columns, marked other phish either on bottom or just off, but the bite was off, by 9:30 nothing more all day"
