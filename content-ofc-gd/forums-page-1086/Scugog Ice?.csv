Not so bad out on the lake for walking.  Fish are there, iced 2 eyes, snapped one off in the hole, and lost another. 2 bass, 1 LM, 1 SM, and one bluegill......first gill I've caught out there.  I was set up for crappies and didnt' get any......  ........I usually set up for eyes.......and get crappies....  .....go figure  Sinker"
