158466,ilario11,2008-02-08 02:19:00,41,Disgusting dispaly...i never heard fans booing an injured player...poor Colaiacovo bangs his head into the glass and is almost knocked out - must be part of their distink society
158468,gone_fishin,2008-02-08 02:34:00,481,"i agree! that was awful! it wasn't much of an injury, but still, most places will cheer for a guy when he gets up off the ice."
158469,danc,2008-02-08 02:36:00,4677,   lol. Now that's funny right there...
158473,irishfield,2008-02-08 02:44:00,26272,
158477,gone_fishin,2008-02-08 02:50:00,481," maybe, but immediately after he got up, they started chanting ""leafs suck""...  the building was pretty quiet after they scored in the empty net though... Bahahaha"
158490,darsky,2008-02-08 03:30:00,586,did you see what he tried to do to Koivu? Penalty for attempt to injure or boarding would have been the cherry
158498,carll2,2008-02-08 04:18:00,443,that had to be the worst check ive ever seen but shame on habs fans for booing him  tskk tskk
158500,carll2,2008-02-08 04:21:00,443,
158507,bow slayer,2008-02-08 06:32:00,1074,the fans were booing because of the  non call by the refs and the cheap shot by Carlo on the habs captain. Justice was served thou by injuring himself on the attempted cheapshot. I see no problem with the booing.
158616,walleyejigger,2008-02-08 18:39:00,876,"i was watching at home and was booing, and some cuss words came out as well, guess i'm classless  i've been called worse  go habs go"
158645,EVINRUDE-DUDE,2008-02-08 19:53:00,39, No class ??? Come on now if you are going to throw rocks don't live in a glass house.The leafs were voted the most hated team in Sports Illustrated a few years ago.   go sens go
158646,irishfield,2008-02-08 19:55:00,26272, Yah.. but that's only because their Zamboni is powered by Mercury!
158650,EVINRUDE-DUDE,2008-02-08 20:07:00,39,LOL even an evinrude couldn't help the leafs
158809,Mike the Pike,2008-02-09 05:37:00,3421, Don't forget the Habs are right behind the Sens in points.  Just didn't like the comment about distinked society.Someone always has to drag politics into hockey.  Another who thinks that ALL Quebecers think the same way.Another cheap shot.If it wasn't for people like me Quebec would have seperated.Just wish we could here about hockey and not those snarky comments about Quebec.Just trash I tell ya.  BTW when the Habs are down I stick behind my team.I don't bash them cause i am truly 100% a Habs fan . I don't jump on and off the band wagon.  Keep the political trash out of hockey.  MTP
