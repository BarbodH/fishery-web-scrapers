157859,Woodsman,2008-02-06 07:33:00,1286,Considering booking there next summer. Has any one stayed there before. Also hows the fishing in the area. I know summer is not always the best time of the year but plant shutdown decides when my holidays are.  Best Wishes: Rick

I'd drive a bit further and stay at one of the lodges on Lake Temagami or even better IMO, one of the camps on Lady Evelyn Lake. Bigger, more interesting water and in the case of Lady Evelyn much more remote.."
157867,bowshep,2008-02-06 10:13:00,378,I would have to agree with Solopaddler. Martin River area is nice on the eye's but Nothing like Lady Evelyn. The fishing prospects are alot better as well. l have recomended this place to a few people on this board and have never had anyone complain. Go the extra mile it will be worth it.  Peace Ken.  If you need info send me a pm.

If you want to rough it, try Lake Wichstead that flows into the Martin River, only has a rough ramp. Load your boat, and head up the lake to an island and set up camp."
