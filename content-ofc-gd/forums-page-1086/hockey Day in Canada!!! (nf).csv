One of my favorite days of the year is here and under way!  over 12 hours of coverage including the 3 hours from 12-3 before the pros play where cbc tours towns across Canada talking about hockey with real players.  There is no whining millionare players here, no billionare owners raising ticket prices, its real canadian kids playing the game all over the country.  To me this is Hockey!!!!!!!  I love it!!!!  happy hockey day!  cheers!"

Apparently he is a successful Businessman who he owes his success from the Experiences that hockey gave him. When I heard his stats I was amazed at his hockey accomplishments.  A warrior indeed with rings including Stanley Cup, Juniors ( he was initially involved in the Famous Russia/ Canada Brawl World Juniors) etc, six Rings in total.  An all star many times.  Possibly Hall of fame but I doubt it considering his bad Boy image.  Whats the most amazing thing is he was only 5'6.  He opened doors for small players like Martin St Louis"
