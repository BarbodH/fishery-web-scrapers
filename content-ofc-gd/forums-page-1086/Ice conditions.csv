158369,Shelley Cooper,2008-02-07 22:51:00,394,"Last night while looking outside.. we didn't think we did to bad with the snow fall amount, but this morning, we awoke to this.....   I later took a trip to the Park and things did not look good... Ski doo's were even having a hard time.... Talked with a few people just coming in, and they said it was not good out there… They said they didn’t know if they were stepping in a slush hole or an ice hole… the slush is sooooo bad….They were going out to bring their huts in, but didn't feel it was safe////  Here’s what the entrance onto the ice looked like this afternoon….   A close up……   Don’t go out alone….."
158378,Big Cliff,2008-02-07 23:29:00,6899,"We are going to need some really cold weather before that firms up! Thanks for the report and pictures, I was hoping to get out this weekend but I think I might just wait a while longer."
158384,buckster,2008-02-07 23:35:00,530,was gonna head out there in the morning but i think im gonna pass lol
158385,Terry,2008-02-07 23:37:00,14456,"with all the snow, the slush may not freeze.....like last year"
158386,Meely,2008-02-07 23:38:00,282,BC.....I concur !  May be just the weekend to get all those odd errands/chores  dun !!   Meely
158392,irishfield,2008-02-07 23:49:00,26272,"Thanks for the report Shelley !  The good thing is, Terry... no snow fall up North."
158566,Garyv,2008-02-08 15:05:00,547,"Yesterday on the dirt roads I do, the snow made plowing a pain as the ground underneath was thawed causing the blade to dig in.  The snow acted like insulation and it would be as bad if not worse ( as shown in the pictures ) if it was covering an already slushy section of ice.  Be Careful!!!!!"
158567,ccmtcanada,2008-02-08 15:08:00,7971,"My backyard rink turned to slush after that last snowfall as well.  I was going to try it out, but didn't want to fall thru the ice.  I do have a float suit now...maybe I'll try it.  Oh wait...the thickness of the ice was only at 4 inches anyways...pretty sure if I fell thru, the water wouldnt' go higher than my boots...LOL."
158571,lew,2008-02-08 15:14:00,12767,"Shelley, the loooooong range forecast for 2 weeks from now is calling for some pretty cold temps with highs about -15 even down here, so hopefully you'll get some decent ice then, if not before.  And we all know the wetherman is NEVER wrong......."
158576,Joey,2008-02-08 15:39:00,9122,Thanks for the pic and update Shelley.  Guess we'll have to change our plans for this weekend  Joey
