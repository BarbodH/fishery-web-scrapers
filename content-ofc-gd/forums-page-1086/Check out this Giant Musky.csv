158581,ccmtcanada,2008-02-08 15:54:00,7971,"Whoa!  Must be one of those European Pike angler who caught that one...either that or it's photoshop....LOL.  Actually, I think my uncle caught that fish.  It is a cool pic...would be cool to visit there one day."
158582,irishfield,2008-02-08 15:55:00,26272,You'll get one like that next year Hun.... don't get in too big a rush!
158583,Roy,2008-02-08 16:07:00,13728,I had heard that that fish was caught on Lake of the Woods.
158586,Whopper,2008-02-08 16:29:00,2174, Yes heard the same thing Roy and a bunch of people are challenging the authenticity of the catch. Some say it was foul hooked.

158593,bigbuck,2008-02-08 16:47:00,2449,"Jeez, that's bigger than Husky the Musky in Kenora!!! But, the next record will come from Georgian Bay or the Larry according to Dr. Casselman, the fellow studying Muskies, the combination of the warmer water and more food leads to a bigger ultimate size."
158614,walleyejigger,2008-02-08 18:35:00,876,heard it was a new 4lbs line weight class record
