158878,Joeytier,2008-02-09 18:13:00,3990,"There's lots and lots of ice on Scugog. I've been 3 times, and gotten 3 eyes, a jumbo perch and a muskie. So far, I've done decent, but not great. I've heard good reports though."
158880,Guest skeeter99,2008-02-09 18:19:00,0,"was out thursday night  a little slushy nothing the bike could not handle, 13 to 14 inches of ice give or take, put it this way all the pickups going by and the ice made no noise!!   2 walleye 1 small musky 7 crappie 2 perch  not bad for 3 hours of fishing LOL!!!  the deep bite is turning on lately 9 to 11 feet of water  **deep is relative for scugog**"
158882,Joeytier,2008-02-09 18:23:00,3990,"Thanks for the info! I hear of so many crappie getting caught out there, but I still haven't gotten any."
158885,Guest skeeter99,2008-02-09 18:28:00,0,"tonnes have been caught now for 3 to 4 winters, the only reason you are hearing about it is because you are now allowed to keep them   bring your simcoe perch gear  smoke tubes and trout craws(natural) or orange work awsome for perch on simcoe and the crappie on the bog love em even more"
158889,Joeytier,2008-02-09 18:34:00,3990,1‚Äù Berkley Trout Craw's?
158890,Guest skeeter99,2008-02-09 18:39:00,0,"yep!!!  berkley trout craws  secret bait for about 5 years now alot of guys use them on simcoe now after they were featured for perch on al linders show last year   bite a little bit of the craws tail off and put on a 1/32 or 1/16 green or chartreuse jighead and just shake it about a foot or two off bottom let the fish tell you how high up in the water column they are experiment at different heights   dont jig them, just shake, same for simcoe just shake way more action and way more bites  and to boot the walleye will smash them"
158893,Joeytier,2008-02-09 18:45:00,3990,Awesome! Thanks a bunch!
