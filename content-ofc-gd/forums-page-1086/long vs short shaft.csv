158270,ilario11,2008-02-07 18:19:00,41,Hi folks:  Does it make much difference? I have a short shaft currently but I may buy a motor that is long shaft... I have a 14' boat and it doesn't have a very high tansom - about avg. Is there a concern that I could damgae the prop if it bottoms out while driving or boating? Should I stick to the short?   thanks!  PP
158276,Sinker,2008-02-07 18:24:00,8692,"Well, if it is a short transom, you want a short shaft motor.  You can run a long shaft on a short transom, but you won't get the same performance, and you wont be able to go as shallow.....obviously.....won't hurt the engine though.  Sinker"
158277,irishfield,2008-02-07 18:25:00,26272,My wife has always wished she picked up the long shaft model... but at least she got a tiller !  Performance will suck PP if you go long shaft on a short transom boat.

158306,linweir,2008-02-07 19:48:00,202,"I will say it should be OK as long as it's NOT an extra long shaft one. say, if your old motor length is 15 "", and your new motor shaft is 20 "", performance will be affected a bit, but it should be OK in many environments."
158372,ilario11,2008-02-07 23:05:00,41,"You guys are pigs!! LOL!  I'm satisfied with the current length of my shaft (the motor, that is)..."
158375,2 tone z71,2008-02-07 23:26:00,1311, other than a HUGH spray from the gearcase being way too deep not to mention you will need arms and shoulders like Popeye if its a tiller version to hang on to it when the props biting
158379,Burning Babies,2008-02-07 23:31:00,150,"I've got a long shaft 15 hp tiller on my 14' tinny, and a short transom (hey, I only payed $100 for the motor).  It hauls, and is physically easy to operate.  I'm sure I would be better off with a short shaft, but I get along fine with it.  No excessive spray either."
158453,tomO,2008-02-08 01:50:00,363,you can get an attachment to fit on your transom to raise the motor. I'm brain dead at the moment and can't remeber what it's called.
158482,Sinker,2008-02-08 03:13:00,8692,  Jackplate......google it.  Sinker
158555,2 tone z71,2008-02-08 14:17:00,1311, ohh I was talking 25 hp and greater havent had a 9.9-15 since I was 8
158558,2 tone z71,2008-02-08 14:23:00,1311," ive got a CMC 5.5 jackplate on my boat not for differance in shaft length,its a 20 inch on a 20 inch transom,the  jackplate does put a fair amount of stress on the transom they are rated to 300 hp thou,lifts/lowers 5 inchs either way"
