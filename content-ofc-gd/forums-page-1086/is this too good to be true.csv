158783,irishfield,2008-02-09 02:44:00,26272,He thinks he's on ebay and going to start accepting bids at that price!
158785,Vanselena,2008-02-09 02:48:00,269,Someone was doing this on ebay befor and it was a huge scam. They would tell people to send a huge deposit to hold it and the boat was never there. Be careful with these too good to be true deals.
158786,Dondorfish,2008-02-09 02:50:00,1000,Alot of those adds are fake - send him an email and see if he responds - don't cost nothin' to ask.  If a deal sounds to good to be true - it usually is!!!   Don
158787,darsky,2008-02-09 02:51:00,586,just noticed it on Toronto Kijiji. Definitely NOT kosher
158789,bassboy,2008-02-09 02:56:00,161,"Hmmm.....if he is in Montreal,, why does it look like it has Oklahoma registration numbers on it??? And if he actually is in Oklahoma, why is he trying to sell it in Montreal?  Call me skittish but something just does not seem right there.....  Bill"
158816,forrest,2008-02-09 07:38:00,1032,"Nothing in the add shows that it it certainly a scam.  Very strange?  Yes.  Be suspicious?  Yes.  Send an email and get details, the ad does not say where the boat is or how the auction would take place.  Maybe the seller lives in Oklahoma and he heard that Canadians are on a spending spree due to the good dollar. Maybe he is desperate to sell and things are selling so fast where he is. Maybe the boat is close than you think.  forrest"
158860,bassman,2008-02-09 16:00:00,384,Scam. It will probably be removed in 1-2 days.
158874,OhioFisherman,2008-02-09 17:54:00,6623,"Some thing doesn`t seem right with the info, like mentioned the OK registration numbers also cause concerns. 17 foot boat with a 90, basically a bare bones package, but like 1/3 the price of new for a 3 year old? Strange?  http://www.boattrader.com/listing/2005-SKE...-SX170-91561981  http://www.strikebass.com/ccboat7.htm"
158877,Guest skeeter99,2008-02-09 18:13:00,0,"christ my 2000 skeeter ss90 with a 90 hp is worth $10 grand right now  and this boat has the full options on it other than max h.p. in dash finders upgrade, glovebox, underseat cooler, upgraded rims   something aint right!!!  other than he is caught up in the mortgage scandal in the u.s. and needs a quick few dollars now than later!!!!  send email I bet you wont get a reply, but hey who knows  I picked up a 3 year old 670 ski-doo in oshawa for $1000 from a guy who lost his job at GM turn around and sold it for $3200 2 days later  !!"
158903,Blue_Axela,2008-02-09 19:35:00,88,Here is another great deal!  http://london.kijiji.ca/c-cars-vehicles-bo...QQAdIdZ37692983
158904,Blue_Axela,2008-02-09 19:36:00,88,If you notice the pics the seller put up.  They are from Ebay.  They have the little camera watermark at the bottom right corner.  Ebay usually puts that watermark on images uploaded to their server.
158906,aniceguy,2008-02-09 19:44:00,1094,just saw one of these scams sell on ebay...... I noticed the guy wanted 500 s a deposit and then go from there
158910,cranks bait,2008-02-09 20:05:00,721,"Wow.  My boat that is 20 years older and a lot less power/toys cost more than that.  It's deals like these that make me wonder how long this thing sat at the bottom of a lake?  If you can see it in person and it is what it says, my guess is that it is already sold."
159022,Garyv,2008-02-10 03:29:00,547,If it sounds to good to be true than it probably is...I highly doubt it's for real and if it is make sure he has paid all the Canadian taxes on the Oklahoma boat as you will be when you go to register it....Naw ain't gonna happen because the deals a fake.
159046,Badger Shark,2008-02-10 04:40:00,291,Definitely a scam.  Friends of ours almost got rooked on a similar scam involving a 24 ft trailor. They were going to put 3 grand down to hold it but at the last minute did some checking and found it to be a fraud scam.
159064,Vanselena,2008-02-10 10:43:00,269, I live in London and I can tell you with a certainty the grass isn't that tall in April as shown in the pics.
