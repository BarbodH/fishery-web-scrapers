Well we finally got out Thursday on Moira Lake. We launched at 8am and we were both confident this day would produce. I've only caught 2 musky so far after trying all summer so I am still looking for some pointers and experience. Well the day started off slow, I had a follow but not what I was looking for, a smallmouth bass following a sledge that was almost as big as he was. Stacy caught a couple of pike in the mid to high 20 inch range on a topwater but still no sign of a musky. Suddenly he see's a follow! As he's reeling closer to the boat, turns out to be just another smallmouth. Very nice sized but not what we were looking for. While using a bucktail I hooked into something, my first hit of the day. First it didn't feel that big, then it felt pretty heavy and I got a little excited. Well it turns out it was just a 5-6lb pike that ran into a bunch of weeds after I caught it. We were starting to get hungry so we went into town for lunch for a bit of a break. He had more confidence in the afternoon bite despite not seeing any fish in the morning.  We started fishing bulldawgs which I've used very little so far. Still nothing for about 2 hours until shortly after 2pm I'm popping the bulldawg up in deeper water when it feels like I snag on a log, I set the hook just to be sure and it starts to move! I yelled ""Got one!"" and Stacy tells me to hit it again! So I set the hook hard into it again and the fight was on, it stayed deep until I got it to boatside then Stacy netted it. What a rush! I could tell right away it's a new personal best, measured 42"". She swam off strong too, nothing better to see while fishing then that. My link My link Shortly afterwards Stacy hooks into a musky on a bulldawg but he says it's fighting weird. Well it jumps a few times and then we see the lure is actually hooked on it's gill plate with part of it in it's gills. Looked real bad when I netted her but when we got looking a little closer somehow her gills were untouched and just the gill plate was hooked. After I cut the hooks out he released her (guessed about 36"") and she swam off strong. Whew.  A while later after a couple of guys he knows pointed us in the direction of where they had just spent half an hour trying to get a couple of really big fish they raised to bite, Stacy caught another musky on a topwater and it's head was massive....but that was about it. This was by far the UGLIEST fish I have ever seen. It was 45"" long but it's body could not have been bigger than my forearm (and I'm not a big guy), it couldn't have weighed 10lbs. It had scars on it's head, a jaw that looked like it had been broken in the past, it never even put up a fight. I called it a Pep Boys musky because it was all head and no body. It was literally shaped like an arrow. After releasing it she stayed at the surface for about a minute or so before finally swimming off slowly. I kind of wish I got a picture of it just because it was so bizarre. This was 1 really old/sick fish WAY past it's prime. He drove over to the guys afterwards and said ""You can keep you're ugly musky!""  Shortly before we were about to leave I got a really hard hit on a jerkbait, I set the hook HARD into the fish, had it on for about a second or two and then nothing! I looked at my leader afterwards and the 150lb flourocarbon was frayed pretty badly in a few spots. It hit the leader, not the lure! So frustrating!  All in all I had a pretty awesome day, got my biggest fish so far and learned some new techniques. Now I have a new personal best to beat when I go with Musky Mike in October!"
624658,Rizzo,2011-09-25 01:02:00,4754,great stuff! no wonder my musky days aren't as good...I'm always off the water by 2:00. Sounds like that's when the fun started for you guys
624665,Dontcryformejanhrdina,2011-09-25 01:14:00,535,"Also, how can I get pics to show in this thread? It doesn't seem to let me insert photobucket photos. Yeah....I'm not very computer savvy.       "
624672,mercman,2011-09-25 01:28:00,7054,Nice Musky !!! Mike'll help ya git a nice Ski for sure Congrats my friend  Paul

624768,ehg,2011-09-25 14:41:00,2666,"Congrats on a very successful day! Going out with a guide must have really shortened the learning curve. Enjoyed the reading,"
624864,moxie,2011-09-26 00:04:00,1566,"Congrats on the fish. I've dealt with Stacey a few times. Knowledgeable, professional, and helpful."
625470,marine5068,2011-09-27 19:14:00,26,"Nice fish and a GREAT lake to fish on. Although I am a bit biased seeing as I live a stone-throw from Moira and have fished it for Musky, Bass and Pike for years now. Stacey is a good fellow for sure. He's always got that smiley face on and has lots of experience fishing Musky on many of our local waters here. I see him on the water and at the ramps a lot and who can miss that big boat with ""PRO_TACKLE"" on it. His shop seems to be doing well too. Good luck out there on the water. ~Stan (Madoc)"
625473,mike rousseau,2011-09-27 19:28:00,4661,"nice catch...  hopefully they are ""ON"" when you come down here..."
625680,Dontcryformejanhrdina,2011-09-28 03:00:00,535," I hope so too. I  think I'll be more excited if my brother catches one since he's never fished for musky before.  I caught another musky in Head lake in Haliburton yesterday. Only 33"" but it still fought pretty hard, felt bigger than it was and still had tons of energy when I let her go. That was my first musky while trolling (literally hit about 5 seconds after I started trolling, in open water). I also had another one hit trolling (both on soft plastics) but spit my lure, one blew up on my bucktail at boatside but never stuck, and 2 more followed to boatside but never hit.  I'm gaining more confidence in different techniques and trolling too. After going all summer without getting much of anything other than 2 hits I've caught a musky the last 3 days I've went out.   Thanks everybody."
