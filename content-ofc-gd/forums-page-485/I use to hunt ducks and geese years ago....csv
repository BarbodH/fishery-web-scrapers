Needless to say I found myself another spot to fish didn`t feel like getting shot by one of the  The local co would have had a field day if he had parked his butt by the weed bed by the park."
625151,jedimaster,2011-09-26 22:19:00,3472,"The thing I never understood about bird hunting is why its not ok to shoot at a goose after its in the water, but its not ethical to shoot at a deer running. Anyway, just one of those things I guess."
625152,misfish,2011-09-26 22:21:00,29133,"What r you talking about sir,thats not a horse,thats a moose.   No, no, no, those are not snow geese,they are seagulls."
625156,lew,2011-09-26 22:35:00,12766,"Ten years ago me and buddy were casting a nice little bay one evening when a hunter in his camo boat came into the bay, pulled up beside me and told me to get out of ""his"" bay because he wanted to kill some birds from there and I was in his way.  I told him it wasn't polite to order folks around and seeing as he was such a jerk we may just hang around till the sun went down, which we did.  He got mad and left but as he was going past me I told him that next time he wanted to hunt an area and someone was already there before him,  a change in attitude and maybe a ""please"" may get him a bit more co-operation.  Folks with attitude problems shouldn't own guns."
625186,Rustic-Fisher,2011-09-26 23:57:00,826,Exactly why I mainly stick with the upland hunting LOL. even that gets crazy in spots. Heres a few from today.
625189,misfish,2011-09-27 00:01:00,29133,Nice firearm.

625225,Rattletrap2,2011-09-27 01:33:00,1652,"Gord, A few years ago, I was fishing in the swampy area just South of the boat canal with a Buddy and his young son. We had just noticed some decoys and even a few motorized ones bobbing around with a few real geese, when all of a sudden three yahoos come blasting their way into the area in a 12 foot tinny. The boat was still under full power when they all started shooting horizontally across the water!! I couldn't believe it! If anyone had of been on the other side of some tall rice there, they would have been shot!   That was enough to keep me out of that area! I hardly ever fished in there anyways, but never after that during hunting season!  Sportsmen, huh? LOL"
625259,Sinker,2011-09-27 02:49:00,8692,"You can expect all the yahoos out on opening weekend. I'm as hardcore as they come when it comes to waterfowl, but I skip opening day. I will be in the marsh mid week, when I have it all to myself, and the birds aren't scared to death by all the shooting!!  Give it a week or two, and you will only see the more hardcore waterfowlers out there.   S."
625297,fishindevil,2011-09-27 11:25:00,6254,"wow on pigeon lake they were shotting big time on the weekend,some on my lake but when i went fishing to pigeon they were blasting alot !!!"
625300,Billy Bob,2011-09-27 11:48:00,5865, These waterfowl are bad bad birds and need to be punished and shot before sunset....
625308,Jer,2011-09-27 12:36:00,1426,  Most of the shootin around here seems to be well after sunset...
625312,NAW,2011-09-27 12:43:00,4022,"There is always going to be idiots in every sport.  The idiot hunters are just more noticable cuz they make a lot of noise.  I've come into my hunting spots and have had fisherman there.  I have no problem waiting for them to finish casting that bay, or I'll set up in another spot and wait for them to leave.."
625317,ricoboxing,2011-09-27 12:52:00,398,"Just give it another month. Once the weather gets really cold, the sky blasters will be gone.  My duck hunting season won't start till next month anyways."
625459,cityfisher,2011-09-27 18:35:00,959,i remember hunting public land .... no fun!  Private Marsh filled with ducks... awesome
625471,NAW,2011-09-27 19:17:00,4022,"Hunting on public land close to a city =  Hunting on public land, as in northern ontario crown land ="
625509,jedimaster,2011-09-27 21:25:00,3472,I enjoy setting up my duck blind about 20 feet off shore from the park in Port Perry. When all the kids come to the park after school at 3:30 and chase all the gees off the shore is ablast fest.
