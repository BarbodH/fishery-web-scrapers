625556,Gutpile,2011-09-27 23:24:00,27,Are firearms included in the tax free sale?
625564,cranks bait,2011-09-27 23:38:00,721,They were when I bought my shotgun about three years ago.
625598,registerfly,2011-09-28 00:41:00,198,"should be one soon as there were quite a few earlier in the year. I say October. and will apply to most items not on ""special"" and lately not applicable to CanGoose, but was at one point not too long ago."
625639,whitbyboatguy,2011-09-28 01:38:00,130," They have way too many items marked ""special"". What a load of $%#!!"
625652,Rizzo,2011-09-28 01:59:00,4754," I guess the popular items they could knock a few bucks off so that the 13% discount wouldn't apply. Not sure if they do that, just a thought, especially on big ticket items where the tax might be $75"
625688,young_one,2011-09-28 03:46:00,620,"They just got a bunch of new Shimano and Daiwa rods, I doubt they'll have any special soon."
