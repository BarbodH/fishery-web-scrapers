625262,kickingfrog,2011-09-27 02:53:00,8333,Going down to a bills game next month. Last time it took us longer to get out of the parking lot then it did to cross the boarder. Don't want to hoof it for 5kms but I don't want to spend an hour and a half moving at the speed of Rob Johnson's progressions.  Send me a pm if you have a spot that you are willing to share.  Thanks.

625295,danbouck,2011-09-27 11:15:00,4380,I think you either deal with the traffic or walk for 5k and still deal with traffic. Best advise I have is to park so you can go straight off the curb onto the road.
