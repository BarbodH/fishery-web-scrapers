625496,northernpike56,2011-09-27 20:53:00,717,I went up and caught some walleye and bass so I know they are in there. Are there pike as well? Speck lakes nearby by any chance?  Matt.
625530,camillj,2011-09-27 22:14:00,1988,Three Mile is good for Bass and Walleye ... so you got it covered ... if you do find out about the 'Speck lakes' and need company PM me ... I am not far from there and definitely willing to bishwack a wee bit
625531,mercman,2011-09-27 22:18:00,7054, I havent BISHwacked in years Camil Not sure i remember how its done.
625769,Lunkerhunter,2011-09-28 13:39:00,455,"first which three mile are you referring to, unfortunately there are a few. Is it the one close to the town of Windermere or Rosseau?  if so, there is no pike in the lake, good sunfish, perch and rockbass populations. bass and walleye are the 2 main species in the lake most people target. i have a cottage up there but never seem to venture into any of the backlakes. i probably should start to."
625787,cityfisher,2011-09-28 14:38:00,959,defiantly bass and walleye and lots of weeds .. except for the bay to the north
