625026,bigbuck,2011-09-26 16:40:00,2449,Nice Fish!!! Looks like you had a wonderful trip. Congrats on the PB's!!!!
625030,mpt,2011-09-26 16:45:00,158,"Great report, wish I was there."
625033,F_ast,2011-09-26 16:55:00,154,"Hey Rich... Wolseley Bay?  I saw a a couple on the 9th with 2 dogs in the boat at the 5 Finger rapids.  It was the last day of my trip.  I know one of the dogs was a yellow lab, but I cannot remember if the other dog was an Airedale or a German Sheppard.  Was that you guys?  You are lucky you went when you did.  I headed up to Wolseley (Bryer Lodge) on Labor day and fishing was tough... real tough until the Thursday (the 8th) when we landed 4 skis (48, 46, 45 and a 43)... non of out fish were that thick though.  Congrates on the new PBs."
625035,F_ast,2011-09-26 16:58:00,154,Never mind Rich... Guess it wasnt you.  I now see where the camp is.
625042,Rich Clemens,2011-09-26 17:14:00,3131,"  Change of plans for this year.  Most likely I'll be back to Wolseley next year.  Last year, a guy from Ohio was in camp the same week were there and landed 6 - largest 50"".  So, you don't have to go far from camp to get one."
625045,NateFollmer,2011-09-26 17:18:00,19,Those fish are awesome and those pics... WOW! Great scenery - wouldn't mind going there and not catching with a view like that!
625050,Spiel,2011-09-26 17:23:00,9065,"I'm extremely happy (and excited) for the both of you, what a great trip for yous!"
625056,asdve23rveavwa,2011-09-26 17:34:00,2690,Congrats to Patsy!!!  Some really nice skis!!
625096,fishnsled,2011-09-26 19:23:00,3520,"Awesome!!  Some great fish caught by both of you, congrats!!"
625185,msp,2011-09-26 23:56:00,1336,"Very well done to the both of you. I love the picture of the Airedale Terrier. I grew up with one for 12 years. The dumbest dog I ever knew but a true heart of gold. Congrats on the GIANT musky. Good luck next year on that 50""er"
625224,captpierre,2011-09-27 01:33:00,2521,"A report like that gets the heart beating!  BTW with the hooks all falling out on their own, does that mean you go barbless?"
625285,Rich Clemens,2011-09-27 09:30:00,3131,"  Not at this point, although I do have some that are.  Thought about it for a time and started to go that way, but all the new stuff still has the barbs."
625352,F_ast,2011-09-27 13:55:00,154,"Muskie can thrash in the net big time.  It is not uncommon for a hooks to lodge in the netting and the fish literally pulls them out of their face.  Since there is not pressure on the hooks either, they do tend to pop out."
624741,Rich Clemens,2011-09-25 13:05:00,3131,"Well, our annual September two-week fishing trip has come and gone already.  Typically we spend two weeks on the French River.  One week at Rainbow Camp on the North Channel and a second week at Wolseley Lodge.  Due to my Dad's scare with open heart surgery last September, we decided to skip our second week on the French and head over to the Rideau System to spend a week with them.  Probably back to our normal routine next year - especially after the week we had.  We arrived on Friday Sept. 9 to a pretty warm day.   3:00pm temp in my truck was reading 87F.  After an 11 1/2 hour drive, unpacking, and getting everything ready, we just rested Friday night.  Up at 3:00am and the drive, warm weather, we were pretty much wiped out.  (Getting old sticks).  Anyway, the first several days were really touch fishing.  I had only managed 2 pike, but one was a nice 33 incher.   Talking with the owners, it has been a tough fish this year and the water levels are down about 2 feet.   Been like this all year and many folks that stayed there this year were finding things tough as well.   I guess that's why the locals call this place ... ""starvation alley"".  Even the number of this year's catches in the lodge are not as many as part years.  Never been there and only see one mucky pic on the wall.  We kinda figured that the local name would persist for us as well.  Couple sunset shots we took.   For a small digital camera, they didn't come out have bad.    Since the fish weren't biting, you gotta take some pictures of something.        Quick shot of the 33"" pike I was able to land early in the week.  Bleeding from the tail a bit as she started flopping around pretty bad while trying to get the hooks out and the idiot ended up with one set of trebles in her mouth and the other set in her back end.    We were surprised that all the times we have been in the area, we have never seen a moose.  In the back of one of the bays we were fishing, something moving caught Patsy's eye and here it was an entire family.   Male, female, and a little guy.   Never did get too good of shots as they were away from us and they kept the youngster between them.  Of course, once the dogs saw them, the barking drove them away.   Here's one of the better shots we got.     And, of course, after a hard day of fishing, the girls get worn out and ready for a good night's sleep.    Alright, all of that stuff out of the way ... LETS TALK FISH.  Ok, so Wednesday morning rolls around and rain is expected this morning.  We take a look outside and see the dark clouds off in the horizon.  So, the front is coming in.  What better time to fish .. eh ?   So we head off to a little bay not far from camp, just in case we have to make a bee-line back.  I've seen musky in this bay before and have had numerous follows over the years, but never got one to bite.  So, we start here.   We're fishing for a bit and as I am bringing in my double cowgirl (black with silver blades), HERE SHE COMES.  A nice musky following the bait in.   I go into the figure 8 and she passes the bait and make a turn and comes back.  Again, she makes a pass at the front of the boat and keeps going.  I keep the 8 going and she comes back and passed it up once again and heads to the back of the boat where Patsy is fishing.   I yell back ""Look Down"", hoping Patsy can see it.  All I hear is ""Oh my God"" as she sees the fishing coming past.   Patsy had just finished reeling in from one of her casts and the lure was still dangling in the water.   The first turns and comes back to Patsy's bait ... and smashes it.   Then, all Heck breaks out at the back of the boat.  Poor Patsy is standing there, legs apart for balance, both hands on the rod, and the fishing splashing about like crazy.   Talk about an adrenaline rush for her.  I just drop my rod and head back for the net.   After a short fight, she is in the net flopping around.  I just kept her in the net and down in the water while Patsy laid out my release tools next to me.   While flopping in the net, she threw the lure, so this was a good thing.   Patsy got the camera all ready and we lifted her out.    A beautiful thick 49"" musky.   What a fantastic FIRST MUSKY.   After a couple pics and a quick measurement, we laid her back in the water and off she went.  Afterward, Patsy said that she didn't think she really wanted to catch another one like that.  But, that thought was short lived.  Now, like the rest of us, she's hooked.     Here she is ...    SPECIAL NOTE:  Patsy caught her musky on one of Joey's custom-made musky baits.  We have several of them and look .... they do work  About then, the rain started and we headed back in to camp.  Went over to the lodge to have the picture downloaded and be put up on the ""wall of fame"".  The rain quickly stopped and we thought we could head out again as it may have just been a band passing through.   So, off we go to another little bay near by for a little more pre-frontal fishing.  This particular bay, I've never seen a musky before, but it was close and we could fish for something.  We were fishing for about 15 minutes and I had a good hit.   At first, I thought it was a nice pike, until I saw her turn sideways and I knew it was a big fish.  Called back to Patsy to get the net.   This one didn't fight quite as much, so we were able to net her pretty quickly.   Same routine as before, Patsy lays out the release tools.  Like Patsy's musky, mine also threw the hooks while still in the net ... GREAT !!!   Pulled her out, couple quick pics and a measurement.  Laid her in the water and she was off like a shot.   And here she is, another 49"" ... beating the one I caught in Lakair this past June by 1 1/2 inches.    So, in less than 2 hours Patsy and I were each able to land a 49"" musky and set new PB's for both of us.   This ended the day, as we just made it back to camp when the heaven's opened up.  Thursday, post frontal conditions, I figured we would be back to normal now and not catch much.   Fished the entire day and nothing.  We went out again in the evening, back to the same bay where Patsy had caught her 49"".   We we fishing around and I got another hit - another big fish.  This one fought the hardest and took me around the boat for a tour.   Eventually we got her tired out enough to land her.  Once in the net and still down in the water, this one also threw the hooks.   Three big fish and I didn't have to worry about the un-hooking on any of them.  Sure does make the release time faster.   We lifted her out and she was a very nice solid 45"".  Back in the water and off she goes.  Sure looks like our fishing handling skills are getting better as none of the three required much revival - all were off as soon as they hit the water.   Here she is ...    That was it for the week and we moved on to Rideau Ferry.   The fishing was really touch over there.  Worst year ever for us and catching bass.  We only managed a few bass during the entire week.  Not a whole lot to report from here, as the catching was way down.  We spent the week with my Dad and Step-mom and did some running around sight-seeing as well.  We had a great week there with Dad and the Maple Crest Motel and Cabins owners are fantastic folks and very good friends.  So, this was more that just a fishing trip to us.  Couple of the nicer bass we caught.      [One of sight-seeing trips was to Lanark County to see a marble mine.  We were able to pick up a few samples to bring back for our garden.    Now - Next year, we break the 50"" mark at Lakair and we're already booked in cabin 9 for the annual OFC GTG."

624758,Joey,2011-09-25 14:17:00,9122,"Now there is the report I was waiting for.  I am so happy for you guys, and especially Patsy for landing her first monster     I mean look at the smile on her face, it tells the story right there.  Congrats to you both for your new PB's, they are beauties!!!!!  Looks like a really nice vacation and your pics are great  See you in June  p.s.  Should I bring up some more homemade Joey lures in June LOL!"
624765,Rich Clemens,2011-09-25 14:36:00,3131,"  She was using your bait religiously all week.  I'm realy glad she caught one - finally.   Now she's hooked as well.  Patsy tried casting the DC-10's I was using, but just a bit much for her.  I'll have to ask if she wants any more ... or if she'll stick to the purple one you made for her."
624766,Rich Clemens,2011-09-25 14:38:00,3131,  You'll have to get in line.   Two other couples that stay at Rainbow Camp already said the same thing - or it's gonna be one crowded boat.   Better yet - we'll all cram into yours.
624810,Moosebunk,2011-09-25 18:28:00,3970,"My GOD man!!!  Best Rich and Patsy report ever.  Congrats to you, but more importantly, congrats to Patsy for an incredible first muskie.  Very cool!"
