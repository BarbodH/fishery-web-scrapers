625260,Moosebunk,2011-09-27 02:50:00,3970,"Lew.  Your legend is the word, and your word is the image.  I'm picturing you in pictures holding 3 different muskies caught on St. Francis.  There's you, the muskie, the inside of a boat, the water around you and some shoreline in the distance under a blue sky because it was nice weather like you said.  In my mind, it's awesome.  Just how you know it to be.  Good stuff dood!"
625274,Skipper D,2011-09-27 03:34:00,1970,LEW i bet the food was good too.............
625288,lew,2011-09-27 10:33:00,12766,"Thanks folks, it was indeed a great weekend.  Next trip is a few days on Lake St. Clair next month.  I forgot about it, but I actually did take a picture and it's of the cormorants on the Larry. An absolute HUGE flock of them that we saw. Tough to guess numbers but there must have been literally hundreds of birds grouped together sitting on the water. Lotsa seagulls but the majority were cormorants. There's only a few here but many many more outside of the camera lens.  Maybe they were all grouped together out in the middle to avoid the many goose hunters in the reed beds on the weekend  "
625307,mattyk,2011-09-27 12:32:00,2110,"thanks for the report, Lew sounds like fun!"
625309,lew,2011-09-27 12:37:00,12766,"Hey Matt, lemme know if your gonna be back in Ontario next year, be good to hook up again."
625357,outllaw,2011-09-27 14:24:00,1232,we take your word lew. reality is guys. a picture mighta caught lew smiling lol.
625362,lew,2011-09-27 14:40:00,12766," And we couldn't have that, could we George"
625508,DT10Sam,2011-09-27 21:18:00,480,"Hi Lew,  Sounds like you had a great time but I still would have taken a pic of Pete losing one at the boat. Great to hear you and Pete are enjoying the trips, great friends and great memories.  Sam"
624970,lew,2011-09-26 13:44:00,12766,"Like we do every September, Squid and I headed down to look for a musky on the St. Lawrence River (Lake St. Francis) near Cornwall.  The weather was fantastic all 3 days and we were able to fish in shorts & T-shirts which is pretty darned good for the end of September.  I landed 3 muskies  and Pete lost one near the boat, then I had another one blow up on my bait beside the boat but couldn't stick her.  We met Musky Mike and his bud on the water yesterday morning and shot the bull with them for awhile.  Got home last night after a fun couple days.  I seldom take musky pics anymore so you'll just have to take my word for it"
624972,Joey,2011-09-26 13:49:00,9122,"Well I'll take your word for it Lew  Pictures would have been nice tho, even of scenery, you and Pete, etc.  Just so we could live vicariously through your story of your trip  Glad you had a good time bud!  Looking forward to seeing you soon"
624974,lew,2011-09-26 14:12:00,12766,I was actually thinking about you yesterday Joey as we had a pair of Golden Eagles flying around us all morning and I was imagining the great pictures you coulda got with that camera of yours.
624975,ccmtcanada,2011-09-26 14:13:00,7971,I believe you Lew!! LOL  Gotta love short sleeve weather this late in September!
624976,lew,2011-09-26 14:15:00,12766,  Thanks Cliff
624979,bigbuck,2011-09-26 14:18:00,2449,NICE!! I've wanted to fish the Larry for a while. It's on my bucket list.
624989,Rich Clemens,2011-09-26 14:46:00,3131,"I started checking into a possible ""guided"" musky trip on the Larry last year.   I would love to fish that stretch at some point - but a guide would be in order to get started up there.    (I've already developed the pictures in my own  mind - there's some monsters there)."
624990,Roy,2011-09-26 14:46:00,13728,Two Buds having a good time on the Larry. It's one of the best ways to spend a few days. Glad you boys did well.
624991,Terry,2011-09-26 14:48:00,14456,sounds like a good time and great weather too
624992,mercman,2011-09-26 14:52:00,7054,"I DEFINATELY believe you Lew, i been there Glad you guys had fun.   Paul  "
625023,Marty,2011-09-26 16:31:00,873,Love it.   Good job Lew.   I can't wait till I take my son on his first Larry/Ottawa trip.
625024,corvette1,2011-09-26 16:36:00,1765,sounds like you guys had a great couple days congrats on the skis
625029,Squid,2011-09-26 16:43:00,1656,"Lew and I had an awesome time!!! Can't say enough about the weather we had, just amazing. Another successful fishing trip. Couple of scrapes but all in all a great trip. Now off to Lake St.Clair to catch me a big lady."
625057,mike rousseau,2011-09-26 17:39:00,4661,"it was nice meeting you boys out there on sunday...  it was a real hit and miss bite lately...we had a really hard time this weekend...

625087,Handlebarz,2011-09-26 19:10:00,3790,Glad to here you guys had a great time again maybe next time Pete will get a better guide to get some fish in the boat for him  We had some nice weather down here this weekend and I managed to get out with Slow Poke and another buddy as a good guide I let Terry catch the fish  Looking forward to seeing the crew here again
625093,fishnsled,2011-09-26 19:14:00,3520,"Sounds like a great trip Lew. Great weather, friends and fishing. Always nice to meet up with a fellow OFC member too."
625098,Lungelarry,2011-09-26 19:30:00,294,"I,ll bet you saw a couple of bassboats.............."
625104,Squid,2011-09-26 19:39:00,1656,"Yes we did!!  Nice to meet you too Mike. Like you said, muskies are hit and miss"
625112,lew,2011-09-26 20:14:00,12766, Like a swarm of hornets at times Larry
625125,Lungelarry,2011-09-26 20:48:00,294,"Well Lew,it was the B1 weekend...next year watch for that ,and go another weekend and have the river all to yourselves............"
625130,lew,2011-09-26 21:10:00,12766,"It's a massive body of water Larry and I've got no problem sharing it with everyone else. I just wish when their flying down the lake at 75 MPH and I'm trolling, they give me more than 50' clearance when the lake is several miles wide."
625136,mike rousseau,2011-09-26 21:35:00,4661, X2
625161,Rizzo,2011-09-26 22:55:00,4754,"thanks for the update Lew, sounds like you got into a few fish (and sounds like Pete got to enjoy your company!)It'll be your turn next Pete, always seems to be like that in my boat too. If I'm getting them my buddy won't, and if he's on I'm usually off. Funny thing this musky fishing"
625195,monsterfish,2011-09-27 00:07:00,48,"Good on ya Lew!  I love the Larry, but she has been very cruel to me in regards to Muskies. All I have to show for my efforts there is a small 27"" near Gananoque.  Keep your hooks sharp!"
625222,cranks bait,2011-09-27 01:23:00,721,I'll take your word for it.  While I was waterfowl hunting on the Larry this weekend coming back we saw a couple of muskies close to our boat feeding or whatever on the surface.  Pretty cool sight to see.  You're lucky you got to wear shorts.  I was dying of heat having to be camoed up.
