There's a guy I know from England here on a 1 year visa who had never been fishing before in his life. We happened to be in Rockwood 3 weeks ago and he caught a tiny rockbass for his first fish ever. We were gonna go to Guelph Lake right afterwards and do some real fishing but it poured rain.  Since he lives downtown and has no car he can't get out fishing too often.  On the weekend we went to Etobicoke Creek for salmon but only had half an hour to spare and that's too little time to find success.   So to let him catch something that weighs more than an ounce and have a pretty good chance at it, are the suckers around in the fall or where do they go?"
