625327,Roy,2011-09-27 13:22:00,13728,"I have the same motor and I too hear mine do that sometimes. I convinced myself that it's like the rear wheel on a bicycle. When you stop pedaling, it clicks."
625335,Spiel,2011-09-27 13:33:00,9065,"   Exactly, perfectly normal."
625339,vance,2011-09-27 13:36:00,719,"The forward gear on mercury's work on a ratchet principle when you throttle down the boat is going faster than the prop and it will free wheel. With the boat out of the water put it in forward gear and by hand spin the prop backwards and you will hear your clicking,it is suppose to do that.When towing I always put the motor in reverse(no ratcheting) so the prop in the wind doesn't free wheel.I found this out from the dealer when I complained about the same thing.  vance"
625401,LucG,2011-09-27 15:35:00,779, Are there any negative effects if your props spins in the wind?
625407,scugpg,2011-09-27 15:54:00,1373,I leave mine in reverse when trailering and in neutral when using electric
625424,hirk,2011-09-27 16:54:00,571,"Vance is right, engineered to ratchet. How are things Vance?"
625507,vance,2011-09-27 21:18:00,719,"Your prop seals are designed to be in the water and COOLED by that water,if you are going down the 401 or any high way and your prop is spinning there is no cooling and friction will wear the seals out prematurely.I watched a tech spend 1/2 an hour buffing melted rubber off a prop shaft so he could install a new one.  AND it wasn't mine   vance"
625700,blue pickeral,2011-09-28 09:36:00,267," This sounds like very good advice. I usually fasten the prop with a rubber bungy while towing to keep from spinning. With the outboard in gear, your throttle linkage is engaged, freeing fuel flow to carbs or injectors, and perhaps placing undue wear on linkages, springs, accelerator pumps, etc."
625734,bobkayla,2011-09-28 12:29:00,148," thanks for all the info to all,,,the dealer told me not to engage the motor when not running for this reason,,,,having the motor not under a load when in gear will cause the internals,linkage,valves etc. to move against each other"
625782,irishfield,2011-09-28 14:03:00,26272,"Sorry guys, but a properly set up remote helm does not engage throttle as soon as you click it in forward or reverse... and a tiller gets shifted without touching the throttle at all. Fuel can not flow if the pump isn't sucking it up out of  your tank."
