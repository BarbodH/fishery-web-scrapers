624590,mercman,2011-09-24 21:30:00,7054,"I have asked my neighbor at least 5 times this summer, if he wanted to come fishing with me, but he always found a reason not to go.He has never fished in his life, but whenever i brought fish home, he always came over to see them. I asked him again yesterday, when i came back from fishing with the wife, and was surprised when he answered YES. We left the house at noon, and were on the water by 12.25pm.He has never been in a boat either, so when i pulled away from the dock and got on plane, he was grinning ear to ear.10 mins later we were on a spot that has produced for me this summer, and i got him set up with worm and inline spinners i made last nite for the occassion. He only caught 3 small perch, but you tell me by the look on his face if he enjoyed it  We fished for 4 hours altogether and i really wish i could have gotten him a Bass or Walleye, but maybe next time. I caught 2 pike, one of which had huge teeth marks on each side if its body Now i know for sure there are Musky in there also. I also caught a very nice small mouth.It jumped at least 4 times before i got it into the boat, and i thought Serge, my neighbour, was going to flip out.He kept saying how his adrenaline was pumping His eyes were wide open and so was his mouth     I have to admit, i had a really good time introducing him to fishing.He said''Now i know why you guys go fishing so often. It's awesome being on the water, and a rush catching fish'' He also asked if he could come with me again real soon Ahhhh......another one bites the dust.............  Tite Lines everyone !!!  Paul"

624622,Roy,2011-09-24 23:24:00,13728,"Good job, Paul. Hope you didn't show him the secret handshake."
624641,danc,2011-09-25 00:12:00,4677,"That's great Paul.  I just have to mention though that your $150.00 life jacket isn't going to do you much good if it's not buckled up. I bought the same one recently, and I found that it took a little getting used to, but after a few days I didn't even know that it was there. Buckle up my friend. You never know what might happen out there."
624643,mercman,2011-09-25 00:17:00,7054,"  Good advice, thanks Dan . I find when its buckled, the back of the collar scratches the heck outta my neck. I may try re folding it before i go out next time."
624645,danc,2011-09-25 00:21:00,4677," Agreed Paul. It can be a little rough on the neck. But it's better than the alternative.  Next time I see a report from you I want to see it buckled up, or I'll delete it! Deal??"
624647,mercman,2011-09-25 00:23:00,7054,  Aye Aye Captain. You gotta deal
624653,Joey,2011-09-25 00:53:00,9122,"That's great Paul, I bet he'll be wanting to go out with you more often now.  Maybe a new friendship has formed"
