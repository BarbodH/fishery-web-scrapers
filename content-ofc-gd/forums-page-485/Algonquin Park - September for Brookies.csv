624884,mirogak,2011-09-26 01:03:00,387,Ok just got back with a broken heart. Feels worst than grade 10 heartbreak ... I guess that's why theses fish are so prized. Not for your average newbie. But spring is not far.  Full report on Tuesday .... Gotta unpack. Ciao. Miro

624917,mirogak,2011-09-26 02:36:00,387,"Man - I was at Rock lake and what beauty.  Musky! I am happy for you. Ofcourse, must be the experience. Were u there this very weekend I was there?  Did u eat one? If so, how was it?"
624920,Musky or Specks,2011-09-26 02:58:00,2710,"Yes I was there from 2 pm Saturday till 1 PM Today. I let natural specks go for the most part but did keep one very small fish(12"") for the young boy(7 yr old) who was with me cuz he begged me that he wanted to try one."
624921,mirogak,2011-09-26 03:04:00,387,Good for him ... Did he enjoy it. I see he is getting head start.
625001,mirogak,2011-09-26 15:35:00,387,"Here is my report on my novice brook trip to AP:  Was there for 3 days (Fri, Sat and half-day Sunday); stayed at Rock lake due to close proximity to some of the stocked lakes and also for the leaf colours.  Friday - I hit one of the stocked lakes just east of where I was; involved a 2 km easy portage; beautiful isolated lake with nice views; trolled the shores with little cleos and williams wobbler but no hits; tried the rocky shoals, bays and near the eastern spring. Then I changed strategy and tried casting off shore with worms, floats, spinners but nothing except 4 smallies. These guys are everywhere and attracted to me. By the way it was pouring down hard the entire 4 hours I was there. On my way back on the portage saw a mother deer with her two fawns .. nice !!! At least I got something out of the day's adventure.  Saturday - woke up early to take some beautiful shots in the misty morning, even drove to another stocked lake with huge steep cliffs (picture below), tried a few casts but the spot was not ideal for casting, but did hear 3 fish splash in the distance. I knew they were specks because that lake is only stocked with specks. I had to come back to this lake with a canoe when it got darker. But in the meantime I had another lake in mind (that is not stocked) in the Tea lake vicinity. After a heavy breakfast, unfortunately my buddy lit up a spliff (the green stuff) and gave me a few drags. I usually don't smoke that stuff for good reason - because it knocked me out and I went to sleep for a solid 3 hours. So my plans got ruined for that day and we decided to go to the lake where I had seen the fish splash early in the morning. Canoed that lake for a good 4 hours; tried different depths, shorelines, near an awesome beaver damn (just mind blowing), in the marshes but nothing. What happened to those fish that were splashing? But did see lots and lots of baby trouts (or so I think), they could have been minows.  Sunday morning - before breakfast decided to try another stocked lake right off of the highway; there were good casting spots and you could tell others had fished from here because they left garbage and bottles behind (aholes) .... lots of small baby trouts and minnows (I think) but no big bites.  Sunday afternoon - after packing decided to hit the Oxtongue river on my way home. Found a couple of nice holes, had a few small bites and caught two small trouts - 10 incher and 7 incher. Too small and felt bad; so let them go. I only got the photo for the smaller one, see below.  In summary - I shall come back in Spring (mid May) and give it another go. I was not all that disappointed because I came back with some good memories and some new lessons learned. I think the water was still not cold enough for them to surface. I fished the surface; I should have gone deeper with a 3 way setup. No more spliffs  ... and next time I buy a canoe cart. The sights were gorgeous.  Adios, Miro  PS: back to the real world now.   "
625002,mirogak,2011-09-26 15:37:00,387,Here is that baby speck 
625006,mirogak,2011-09-26 15:43:00,387," Thanks Jayess - wish I had read your post on time, it would have triggered me to fish deeper which I didn't and I think that would have made a big difference."
625016,Rod Caster,2011-09-26 16:23:00,5784,Too bad you didn't have Terry's avatar with you on that one morning.  I'm glad you caught a couple speckies... At least you know your not chasing ghosts.  Great report!
625066,Jds63,2011-09-26 18:11:00,1365,"I have had more skunked outings for specks than successful, thats what makes it worth while when you get one ... its always nice just to be in the park for sure ....better luck next time"
625076,singingdog,2011-09-26 18:38:00,1047,"Don't be too discouraged. Chasing specks can be a frustrating past time. Even when you find them, they can turn on and off like a light switch. I have hiked kilometers through thick stuff to get to stocked speck lakes, done everything ""right"" and would have sworn that the lake was deserted. Other times I have done the same thing and had 20 good fish in a one hour period, with long stretches of nothing in between. Good on ya for getting out."
621513,mirogak,2011-09-14 19:15:00,387, Hahahah ... in that case I am going to try the lake that is stocked with both.
621631,singingdog,2011-09-15 09:45:00,1047,"I rarely troll for brookies. I find it much more productive to cast for them. They are often holding very tight to cover that is impossible to get a lure to while trolling. I wouldn't go onto a brookie or splake lake without; 1. a ""5 of diamonds"" pattern little cleo 2. a bucktail jig  No difference between splake and specks when they are in the pan....or on the end of your line."
621901,Cookslav,2011-09-15 21:43:00,1457," Hmmmm didn't realize they closed in September, that seems early???? Its just the areas you identified have no camp sites, so I just assumed you were staying in the Tea lake camp ground but I guess thats why we don't assume"
621902,Musky or Specks,2011-09-15 21:54:00,2710,Yeah since the campsites went private the only one that 's near the west gate that you can be sure is open is Cannis Bay. Not to far of a drive back though.
621938,Minnow,2011-09-15 23:21:00,177,Please be sure to post a report! I have never tried going after algonquin brookies and would definately want to give it a go before sept 30!
621981,northernpike56,2011-09-16 01:31:00,717,"  I always have an assortment of mepps #0,1,2, panther martin #1,2, small williams wablers, small cleo spoons, and 1-3"" rapala plugs with me when im fishing alonquin. If your trolling, try tying a 3 way swivel to the main line, attach a bell sinker on a dropper line to another eye of the swivel, then tie a flourocarbon leader from the 3rd eye of the swivel to the lure you are using. I mostly use this technique when trolling spinners and floating plugs, because the spoons already have some weight so they get you down deep when trolling. If you could buy a few lures I would reccomend you buy a tiny rapala original floater and a mepps XD or black fury #0."
622004,mirogak,2011-09-16 03:13:00,387,"I will post a full report upon return. Believe me ... I told u I have been dreaming about catching specks. So I think I will. And thanks for the tips guys, wish me luck."
622006,mirogak,2011-09-16 03:17:00,387, What is a floating plug?
622014,northernpike56,2011-09-16 03:50:00,717,"  most plugs float, so what happens is that when your not reeling in, the plug is buoyent so it floats to the surface. almost any plug rapala makes is buoyant/floats at a rest, but dosent really matter because youll be trolling it all the time so it wont get a chance to float to the surface"
622046,johnnyb,2011-09-16 12:58:00,3413,"when he says ""plug"" he means a body bait aka crankbait aka minnowbait."
622123,bandito,2011-09-16 18:40:00,16,My first post... Glad to meet y'all.  Here's a little something I found:  http://www.cottagecountrynow.ca/what's%20on/article/1081463--film-north-doc-pleads-case-for-algonquin-brook-trout
622158,mirogak,2011-09-16 21:36:00,387," Got it! re plug ....  thanks, Miro"
622827,mirogak,2011-09-19 15:19:00,387,"Okay .. count down begins 3 days to go before I hit AP.  I hope there is no frost that weekend like this past weekend.  Thinking about these Specks - what is your favourite method of cooking one (Grill, Bake (foil paper), or pan fry)."
622834,adempsey,2011-09-19 15:34:00,1498,"Hope you have better luck than we did!  Went up this past weekend and tried a few corridor lakes for Splake from shore, but only managed some small perch and smallmouth bass.    I think it was just too sunny out for fishing (it was a gorgeous weekend!) and perhaps the water hasn't cooled enough for them to be close to shore.   I'll probably head back up in 2-3 weeks and try again.  Good luck!!"
622837,BillM,2011-09-19 15:42:00,17367,"1,450 views, 38 replies.  ....and people wonder why no one gives out any information on the Internet.  "
622838,mirogak,2011-09-19 15:44:00,387, Yeah - agreed.  I catch the drift now.
622839,Musky or Specks,2011-09-19 15:52:00,2710,
622843,ehg,2011-09-19 16:09:00,2666," Ya, the season closes in about 11 days. Forget about going back and fishing out of season.   Most of the page views are probably repeat visits maybe 3 or 4 groups of anglers will visit a lake mentioned. More than likely they will catch a few smallies and perch (like FishLogic), maybe a couple of splake. No reason to alarm. Never seen an increase in fishing pressure from a post. Then again i don't fish tribs. Hard work and time catches fish. Those that do well are usually good fishermen that are respectful. No needless worries."
623032,adempsey,2011-09-20 00:53:00,1498,"I can fish for Splake in the park until November 30, unless something has changed.  http://www.mnr.gov.on.ca/en/Business/LetsFish/2ColumnSubPage/STDPROD_081310.html"
623900,mirogak,2011-09-22 17:19:00,387,"Okay the time is near and I think I am all set.  For lures I have: - 2 inch Williams wobbler - Little Cleos 1/4 oz and 2/5 oz (sliver/green and silver/blue) - 5 diamonds yellow spoons (various sizes) - Mepps #0, #1 - Blue fox #2 - don't have those minnow/perch type of plugs (cost was adding up fast) I have some top surface plugs and really deep diving ones for bass and walleye  For bait - nightcrawlers, - mini marshmallows marinated with garlic and salt (my recipe ) - my own dough bait (cheese, dough, cornmeal, garlic, and sugar) ... ))  - fresh salmon rowe I got from a Jack I (correction: someone) caught two days ago (no time to cure it)  Spots I'll be hitting (and I don't mean lake names) For specks concentrate on shoreline structure like large fallen trees, beaver huts, inflows and outflows. Windswept shorelines are also good to key on as well as obvious neckdowns and narrows, especially if they contain shoreline structure.Find granite drops....very steep drops, shoals, and shoreline structure with adjacent deeper water When that light starts to fade...cast and cast and cast.Work the shoreline and cast to any downed timber. (these are accumulations of what I gathered from some of you on OFC)  Man, if I don't catch a speck or two, I'd be more heartbroken than I was in grade 10  I hope to provide a full report when I am back in office on Tuesday.  Ciao, Miro signing off."
623908,solopaddler,2011-09-22 17:34:00,8605,Leave the marshmallows and fish eggs at home. Everything else sounds just fine.  A few jigs in a variety of sizes wouldn't hurt either.  Good luck
624005,northernpike56,2011-09-22 22:18:00,717,"ya you will do fine without the plugs, usaully I catch more fish on inline spinners thaN plugs and they're only half the price, but if you really get in to brook trout fishing you should invest in some of the small ones cause they can be great. I think i have 4 right now!"
624087,camillj,2011-09-23 03:25:00,1988,Might consider a black woolley buggar ... or a micky finn as well ... with just a teaser of worm (to sweaten the offering)
624089,danc,2011-09-23 03:56:00,4677,"I'd put some Rapala Countdowns size 3 (cd-3) as well as some small Canadian Wrigglers on my list. Look for agressive first with lures such as this, and then downsize and slow down your presentation if these don't produce. Leave the live bait at home."
624406,jayess,2011-09-24 01:48:00,187,"good on you for pursuing a first speckled catch!  don't forget to prepare for some deeper fishing just in case... in one particular spring-fed lake in the park, my buddies and i had to use 2oz weights to get our panther martins to the right depth for the specks. once we did, it was some good action.  Splake are delicious and put for the purpose of taking. Try Ryan Lake for some good fun.  Cheers!"
621143,mirogak,2011-09-13 18:41:00,387,"Hi all,  I am not new to Algonquin park but I am new to fishing in Algonquin park.  Lately I have become obsessed with Brook trouts - and I have heard and researched that Algonquin has world class brook trout fishing.  Last time I went there on Labour day weekend and tried the Oxtongue river but with no luck.  I think it was the temperature - it was very hot and humid.  I came back to work and have become obsessed with going back and trying my luck again.  I actually have dreams about catching these babies.  Anyways, I am going again on the last weekend of September 23-25.  Since I don't have a lot of time I won't be doing back country.  I want to try the Oxtongue river, a couple of small water bodies just north of Tea Lake and maybe a couple of water bodies just west of Cannisbay Lake.  Please see attached pictures.  I need your help in prioritizing my options.  I usually catch and release but I  definitely want to taste these fish that I have heard so much about. I have researched on this site about lures and how the interior offers much better fishing.  For now I want to try around the Hwy corridor, plus I am not yet ready for the interior (don't have the right gear, next year in Spring for sure)  Also, if the brooks are in spawning mode, do they die shortly afterwards - and would they still taste good.  PS: I found out that the Westward Lake just north of the Oxtonque river between the Whiskey Rapids and Tea Lake offers great views and great brook fishing.  But I think the regulations in that Lake are pretty tight when it comes to keeping it.  I wonder if you guys have fished there and comment on the views and fishing.  Thanks guys,  Appreciate the help.  Miro "
621150,adempsey,2011-09-13 19:15:00,1498,These may help:  http://www.algonquinpark.on.ca/pdf/fish_survey_2010_final.pdf  http://www.algonquinpark.on.ca/pdf/fishstocking.pdf  Good luck!
621158,Musky or Specks,2011-09-13 19:34:00,2710,"Algonquin is a pretty pressured spot. I don't think your going to get a lot of help. Your going to have to go through all the hit and miss that the rest of us have. The stuff that Fishlogic posted is a good place to start. Your going to need a canoe,some effort,and time to dig out the good stuff."
621165,Jds63,2011-09-13 19:58:00,1365,"Algonquin as you already know does have some world class brook trout opportunities. I think most anglers would be hardpressed to tell you where they go but AP publishes a book of their interior lakes and what they hold. The older version if you can get your hands on one even rated each lake, that version was discontinued for obvious reasons.  I have been going on interior trips to Algonquin for many years and most of the big lakes hold brookies, you just need to troll the shorelines in early spring and you will be rewarded. (ie, Dickson, Lavielle)  Along hwy 60 they have stocked many lakes with brookies and splake ,you can find the stocking lists online. I have caught 5lb  brookies in these stocked lakes so you know they are thriving and doing well. Just make sure you read the regs carefully. You also cannot use and live bait in AP.  Good Luck"
621192,mirogak,2011-09-13 21:22:00,387," Thanks jds63 - you mentioned early Spring, what about now.  Isn't now a good time too."
621194,mirogak,2011-09-13 21:24:00,387,"Gents, I totally understand the prized knowledge of secrets spots in AP and I am willing to find mine the hard way.  That is precisely why I am starting out on this journey with these spots.  I just need help from you experts in prioritizing these spots for me, for this one trip.  Thanks, Miro"
621233,BillM,2011-09-13 22:40:00,17367,"You're still asking guys to tell you the best lakes to fish, lol.  There is a reason why it's called fishing and not catching.  Go give it a shot, make some notes and if it doesn't work out do something different next year."
621241,solopaddler,2011-09-13 23:04:00,8605," That book was discontinued because it was spectacularly inaccurate LOL!  To the original poster, none of the waters you're contemplating are what I'd consider quality brook trout waters."
621258,the spirit of fishing,2011-09-13 23:46:00,141,You asked if they die after spawning and they do not;so no need of worrying about them being like the pacific salmon.

621277,mirogak,2011-09-14 00:11:00,387," Hey solopaddler,  I was hoping you'd join in on this thread. Its my last go at it for this year before the season closes down - and I am not ready just yet for the interior waters. It looks like I may just have to stick to bass again for the 4th time this year.  Ok tell me this then - have you guys seen that map by Jeffery. How accurate is that mapping as a fishing guide?  Thanks, Miro"
621282,solopaddler,2011-09-14 00:23:00,8605,"  I have the map, it's a truly beautiful piece of work.  As a navigational tool it's the best I've ever seen.  As a fishing guide, not so much.  Bear in mind most of the traditionally good trout waters in Algonquin are no secret and quite well known.  The best waters are in the interior.  The lakes adjacent to or close to the hwy 60 corridor are just not that good.  Notable exceptions being stocked lakes. I believe someone already posted a link to stocking lists for Algonquin.  It's really not that hard to figure out which corridor lake to hit after studying those lists.  There's a couple of lakes that are HEAVILY stocked. Way more than the others.  If it's wild brookies you're after you're going to have to fish the interior though.  Bear in mind you don't need that much time to do a quality interior trip.  I've accessed Dickson a bunch of times in half a day from the landing at Opeongo.  This obviously includes the use of a water taxi up and down the lake."
621284,Musky or Specks,2011-09-14 00:29:00,2710,"And a lot of the info the park has is deliberately misleading. Every angler I know that is a regular there, when creel surveyed lies thru their teeth as to how the fishing was and where they caught fish"
621306,Cookslav,2011-09-14 01:14:00,1457," Ain't that the truth LOL!!!  Where your trip is focused ""has"" specs I gaurentee...BUT Not in great numbers mainly because of the easy access off the coridor.  But enjoy the views as they ARE beautifull that time of year all along the west gate. But be forwarned you can hear the highway from there....if its a back country experience your after, its not the spot.  If your hell bent on a spec for the frying pan I suggest a stocked lake...there are plenty in the area. BTW...where are you planning to camp at the Tea lake Camp grounds??? If you are, then to be blunt...I'd switch to targeting Bass. Don't overlook smoke creek, and coot L. You might even get lucky and get a spec working the stumps....pray for colder temps though  Cheers,"

621354,northernpike56,2011-09-14 04:04:00,717,I would fish some of the stocked lakes
621412,Jds63,2011-09-14 13:05:00,1365,"The old AP map that actually rated the lakes did have some good info at the time of publication, but those ratings probably don't refelect current situation.  I also have jeffrey's Algonquin map, its the best detailed map of Algonquin for interior tripping. I don't use it as a fishing guide. Since you mentioned fishing the corridor lakes, I think if you get the list of stocked lakes and spend a some time checking them out you  will find that there are some real gems. I agree that they can be hit and miss but you should be successful if you put in the time to perfect your techniques. As mentioned try late September and mid may trolling and casting spinners and small cleos. Algonquin is a beautiful place and I prefer interior trips when i can get the time."
621490,mirogak,2011-09-14 18:15:00,387,"   Yep, I did my homework, studied the lists, and cross-referenced with Jeffrey's map.  I think I have a different set of spots to try now.  Thanks for the tips guys."
621493,mirogak,2011-09-14 18:19:00,387," Nah my friend, Tea Lake is closed for the season as of Labour Day.  And yes I did fish those spots for bass and they were great.  But I only have one thing in my mind - and that is Brookies."
621497,mirogak,2011-09-14 18:29:00,387,"All right folk,  After more due diligence I have new spots and it contains the stocked lakes.  But still have some questions:    Thx, Miro"
621498,mirogak,2011-09-14 18:32:00,387,One last question for those of you who have had privilege of enjoying a speck and splake - do Splake also taste good?
621501,Nemo,2011-09-14 18:34:00,727,"Sounds good Miro,  I would buy an EGB and some Cleos. I like the green and silver.  BTW what spots have you targetted?  Nemo"
621502,solopaddler,2011-09-14 18:38:00,8605, They're fantastic! I don't mind giving up this info...Ermine lake right at the border of the park near the west gate has very good splake fishing.  How you access the lake is an entirely different matter though LOL!
621511,Freshtrax,2011-09-14 19:13:00,2215,"I like near the park not in it..in most cases you will still need a canoe.  Meps, blue fox, ect are my favourites"
621512,mirogak,2011-09-14 19:13:00,387, I am thinking of these spots:  Day 1 - Bluff Lake and Lake St. Anthony Day 2 - Myra Lake and Little Minnow Lake Day 3 - on my way back I will stop by the Oxtongue river between the Whiskey rapids and the Tea Lake Dam  Might be a bit ambitious but will try.
