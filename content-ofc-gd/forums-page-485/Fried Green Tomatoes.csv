624818,aplumma,2011-09-25 19:24:00,6896,O Bob one of the worst dinners I had as a kid was fried green tomatoes. I sat at the dinner table from 6:30 till 9:30 and went to bed. To this day I can't even smell them with out getting green.   Art

624825,dave524,2011-09-25 20:31:00,4508,swap out the flour for Italian seasoned bread crumbs and a sprinkle of parm cheese
624826,misfish,2011-09-25 20:37:00,29133,  Now stop that.I can smell the ribs outside and dont want to spoil my hunger.You can also try Panko as a coating.Nice an crispy.
624842,Billy Bob,2011-09-25 21:46:00,5865,THANKS Gentlemen...and I use that term very loosely...LOL...  Tomorrow is Fried Green Tomatoes using a couple different recipes listed here...
624847,bigugli,2011-09-25 22:31:00,6138,Pickled green tomatoes are also right tasty. Just prepare a standard pickle brine. Instead of dill add a hot pepper or season with oregano
624857,misfish,2011-09-25 23:17:00,29133,"  Knew I was missing something with me dinner. Oh well,have them Monday."
625054,Homer Is King,2011-09-26 17:33:00,305,We slice them and fry them in butter with a little pepper and salt. Awesome!! One of my favorite summer treats!
625060,Headhunter,2011-09-26 17:46:00,5703,"BOb, toss the green tomatos in a paper bag, with a ripe apple. Close the bag and leave it on the counter for a couple of days... you now have ripe tomatos. HH"
625074,misfish,2011-09-26 18:31:00,29133,  Thier not as good though Joe when you want green fried tomatoes.
625100,Headhunter,2011-09-26 19:32:00,5703,"Yah, but why have them green, when you can have 'em red!? HH"
625101,misfish,2011-09-26 19:34:00,29133, Too soft an muchy then.
625194,Fish Farmer,2011-09-27 00:07:00,2234,"I do the same except I fry onions with the tomatoes and when done I Scramble a few eggs and mix in. Stand back, man a work, sparks coming off the fork"
625204,pikehunter,2011-09-27 00:29:00,1659,"Thanks, now I know how to use up some of the green toamatoes from the garden, and I was just thinking about fried green tomatoes the other day...you been reading my mail B,Bob?"
