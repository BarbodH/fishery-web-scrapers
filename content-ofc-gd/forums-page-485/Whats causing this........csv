624608,esoxansteel,2011-09-24 22:34:00,1307,"  My company truck which is the same as yours and same engine, is going in for service on monday for the same thing, will let you know what the problem is, it studders and chugs for 5 minutes and is fine, im assuming an engine miss of some sort either bad wire plug or coil etc"
624617,NAW,2011-09-24 23:01:00,4022,"Same thing happened to a friend, worked fine once the motor warmed up.  It was a leak in a vacuum line as someone stated above.  Once the motor warmed up, it was fine.  Only effected it at a lower RPM."
624640,mercman,2011-09-25 00:11:00,7054,"  too many ditz, not enough dash"
624769,misfish,2011-09-25 14:41:00,29133,"Well it would seem it was the gas cap.  Up early this AM damp out,no studdering or anything.Just zoom zoom zoom.  Thanks again everyone,well almost everyone."
624791,Terry,2011-09-25 16:05:00,14456, I thought maybe where he left the spaces he meant dash.......  as a ham radio operator ..I had to try to make sense of it....LOL
624805,irishfield,2011-09-25 18:05:00,26272, Week of rain coming... you'll get to test that theory I'm sure!
624809,misfish,2011-09-25 18:28:00,29133," Same rain we were to get all weekend aswell.LOL   It was doing it Wayne even after running for an couple of hours.Would of been dried by then.Only when I took the cap off and put it back on,it never happened again.   Ready to do some wood there bud?"
625078,fish_fishburn,2011-09-26 18:47:00,1311,My Ford truck was doing the exact same thing. I changed the plugs and wires and also the inline fuel filter and the problem is solved. So one of those three things did the trick.
625081,misfish,2011-09-26 18:57:00,29133,"  Have done the same the past year. I think though,I may have a punched plug.Getting looked at this week."
625099,Headhunter,2011-09-26 19:30:00,5703,"Brian, my Jimmy was acting in a similar way... so I did what every good OFC'er would... I asked Bernie! He described my problem for me! LOL The engine would run fine, at start up and at pretty much any other time, unless and until I put the engine in a low RPM, high torque situation. It would chug and try and die and only after giving it more gas would it even out... Bernie's answer, sight un-seen... ""Joe, your coils gone"". Sure enough, new coil, wires etc... running like brand new. Just a thought, heck, I am entitled to one a day! HH"
624486,misfish,2011-09-24 14:59:00,29133,"As I was heading out to go fishing,the truck ran normal.Stopped at timmies,get back in and start it up.It,s got a bit of a putting sound.Go to drive away and it,s like it was running on 5 cylinders.As I keep going and shifting gears,it,s still doing it.Then all of a sudden it,s running normal.I stop again,shut it off.Check the oil and it,s fine.Check for a loose plug wire,thier fine.Start it up again and it,s acting up again.Drive back home,and I feel it jug abit then it,s running normal again. Am I looking at maybe a oil pump? All the gauges seemed fine.Bad plug is what Im hopeing."
624487,Skipper D,2011-09-24 15:02:00,1970,"  Its up set that your the only one who ever gets the Tims Brian ....lol , sounds like maybe the fuel pump is starting to let go ."
624488,BillM,2011-09-24 15:10:00,17367,Vacuum leak?
624489,vance,2011-09-24 15:13:00,719,sounds more like a malfunctioning fuel injector to me. My buddies van use to do this all the time.  vance
624490,kickingfrog,2011-09-24 15:14:00,8333,Tighten the gas cap.
624492,misfish,2011-09-24 15:15:00,29133,"Once it gets to running normal,it runs fine until I shut it down and restart it.It,s got balls once it gets past this studdering thing.Starts up like norm aswell."
624493,jat,2011-09-24 15:16:00,138,go to part source and use the diagnostic scanner and see if it throws any codes...................google your problem and see if someone else has run into the same thing.
624494,Skipper D,2011-09-24 15:19:00,1970,  All good answers Brian from the above that are simple to check .
624495,danbouck,2011-09-24 15:24:00,4380,Had 3 fuel pumps go and that happened every time
624496,Muskieman,2011-09-24 15:24:00,2472,I had the same thing happen to my Expedition last month it's a 5.4 V8 the PCV hose had collapsed .. it cost me all of 5$ to fix the problem.  Randy 
624497,misfish,2011-09-24 15:24:00,29133," Went out and unsrewed the cap and snapped it back on.Start up and it was noraml.Drove around the lot and it didnt putter at all  Thanks Rob   Vance I just had the ejectors and throttle body cleaned out.  I,ll hit part sourse later today and see whats up."
624498,misfish,2011-09-24 15:26:00,29133," Yer just full of good news Dan.LOL  Thanks guys for the quick responses.  I,ll go check that as well Randy."
624512,Terry,2011-09-24 15:50:00,14456,I will trade you for my dodge dakota sitting in my driveway
624519,misfish,2011-09-24 15:57:00,29133,"Let me think,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,NOPE."
624520,Spiel,2011-09-24 16:07:00,9065,Could be water in your fuel.  
624522,Tybo,2011-09-24 16:13:00,1373,...  .  .  .  ...  .  .  .  ...  .  .  .  ...
624524,Spiel,2011-09-24 16:21:00,9065, What are you trying to say Paul?
624525,Mike the Pike,2011-09-24 16:26:00,3421,Perhaps its time to change the wiring going to the Distributer cap Brian.
624528,glen,2011-09-24 16:50:00,2641,Try changing drivers and see if that helps.   I just blew the valve stem out of my rim. But at least i know where my problem is.  Hope it works out for ya.
624530,Terry,2011-09-24 16:58:00,14456, thought it might be morse code  ...---...
624532,Roy,2011-09-24 17:02:00,13728,"-.-- .-  Paul, morse only has two characters. It can't be that difficult to spell?"
624533,misfish,2011-09-24 17:12:00,29133,"  Smart  I know where you keep the keys to that ride.LOL  Well since I did the cap,and checked for colapsed hoses,it been starting and running fine.   Thanks again all"
624546,Ron,2011-09-24 17:58:00,1683,"If it happens again next morning, chances are the plugs and wires may need attention. Does this have separate coils for each plug?"
624548,Rob,2011-09-24 18:03:00,467,"Brian check the the coil pack, Ford uses a sealed six wire pack. With the heat in the summer they expand and get small cracks in them, once the moisture gets in there and it then freezes in the winter they split open and more moisture gets in there. The engine will run fine, then like crap. As soon as the moisture evaporates from it it will run fine until it rains again, then it starts all over again. I replaced mine myself and bought the O.E.M part and solved all the problems. You wouldn't believe how cracked that unit was. This problem occurs on most Ford vehicles, but is an easy and quick fix as it only takes about a half hour (takes almost as much time to find the damn thing!).  Hope this helps,  Rob"
624552,misfish,2011-09-24 18:31:00,29133,"Thanks again guys.  Like I said,once I did the gas cap it was gone.Rob Im out yer way Sunday.Looking at some new hunting property.I,ll drop by and you can have a look.   Not sure Ron, on the coils."
