624100,taper,2011-09-23 08:11:00,611,So I bit the bullet and bought a HDS 8 with structure scan. Jocelyn is sold out right now so in his normal fashion he gave me the unit off his boat ( cant ask for better service). My question is when they come in I don't know if I should buy the base unit or the one with insight. What does insight give me and should I get it?
624101,Terry,2011-09-23 09:23:00,14456,it is a mapping option but I have not seen anywhere that is says they have Canadian lake in the insight format
624117,scugpg,2011-09-23 11:58:00,1373,"I think the Insight only goes into high detail for the great lakes. For inland Canada lakes you may need hotmaps.  The base models come with great lakes mapping, just not in high detail like the insight or another chip."
624140,Rae,2011-09-23 13:19:00,21,"I have two HDS 5's that came with my boat (US boat) One of the units has Insight, and from what I've seen the base map itself is identical. The insight has these little icons on the popular lakes (US lakes and great lakes) that when you cursor over them they will give you information on the area and some tips.  I was on Erie in the spring and I was near Windmill point, and there was an icon on the map that explained the sanctuary area that was closed at the time and what the popular presentations are when the area is open. It's a neat feature for sure but if I was buying a new unit I would not be worried about getting it.  Jocelyn would be able to tell you all the differences for sure... Rae"
624160,grimsbylander,2011-09-23 14:13:00,3016,I really have to get over and get a HDS lesson from Joselyn. I need to completely set up my boat with bow and console electronics and I've pretty much decided to go with the Lowrance HDS series. So many options and variables!
625108,taper,2011-09-26 19:55:00,611,Thanks guys just got home. I am on my way to Angling outfitters and see what Jocelyn has to say about it.
