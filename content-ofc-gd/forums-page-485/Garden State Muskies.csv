Water temps down here are around 68-69 degrees right now. This lake is crazy busy with pleasure boaters all over the place and we figured the cloud cover and chance of rain might hold them off (It did, but only for a little bit). Anyways there are some big fish in this lake, and this is my second time fishing here. I have seen pictures of several 50's out of this lake. The locals who fish it told us that you can only catch them trolling and not casting. My friend and I didn't believe them, so we gave casting a try. Ended up catching a nice little piggie that measured 40"".It was my first fish on a suick. Not a very big fish by ontario standards but not bad down here being very close to New York City.Anyways let her go after a quick picture and she took off after she hit the water."

625354,Musky or Specks,2011-09-27 14:03:00,2710,Pretty sure that's a tiger. Nice fish man. A lot of tigers stocked in the states because they are cheaper and easier to raise.
625361,Roy,2011-09-27 14:32:00,13728,Could be a tiger or a stripe phase. I'd guess tiger.

625372,LucG,2011-09-27 14:55:00,779,"Nice fish Matt, great pattern on it too!"
625386,fishindevil,2011-09-27 15:09:00,6254,nice color ski !!! cheers
625415,mattyk,2011-09-27 16:37:00,2110,Im pretty sure its a barred musky. I have caught several tigers and this does not resemble them.
625430,Spiel,2011-09-27 17:07:00,9065, Either way a beauty fish Matt.
625708,ehg,2011-09-28 11:33:00,2666,For a lake so close to New York City it is fairly empty that day. That is a real fine New Jersey musky. Congrats
