624738,monsterfish,2011-09-25 12:45:00,48,Very nice!  Both boat and fish!
624739,bigbuck,2011-09-25 12:55:00,2449,Nice! You're back on the water and you slimed her first time out! There is definitely a good bunch of folks here. Great little rig for the Kawarthas! Enjoy it!
624740,ccmtcanada,2011-09-25 12:55:00,7971, And that was with 2 adults and all our gear...it did 50 km/h when I took it for a spin with just me in it...without the floors etc...  We'll hit one of those secret spots in it for sure Mike!!!
624743,Rich Clemens,2011-09-25 13:12:00,3131,Now that's a great way to break in a new boat.
624746,Beans,2011-09-25 13:26:00,3339,FYI...I believe Crappy Tire sells those gas lines...  Nice ride !!!
624798,fishnsled,2011-09-25 17:08:00,3520,"It certainly was a great day on the water Cliff. Good friends, good fishing, good times. Nice to have slimmed up the new ride with you. Very impressed with how that boat runs fully loaded and the comfort of the seats, awesome! I'm guessing you took the day off from fishing today? That one fish wore you out did it?"
624799,Dutch,2011-09-25 17:12:00,831,Nice looking rig - thanks for the report.
624807,Moosebunk,2011-09-25 18:21:00,3970,"Perfect Cliff.  The fishing good, the boat great.  The additions and help from buds to make it sea worthy, awesome.  Enjoy it man, it'll serve ya well."
624808,BFSC Kevin,2011-09-25 18:22:00,1351,Awesome vessel there cliff. Only issue.. It's a tiller.
624904,Mike the Pike,2011-09-26 01:51:00,3421,  Now Kevin we could debate the Tiller thing lol
624909,ccmtcanada,2011-09-26 02:01:00,7971,Thanks guys!  Will...that one fish didn't tire me out.  Have you been told yet today? Lol  Tiller/console....not going there in this thread Kevin...maybe you could start another thread asking about that lol!
624916,Leecher,2011-09-26 02:13:00,7832,Sweet ride Cliff   Looks in perfect condition Awesome you got her slimmed
625121,lew,2011-09-26 20:35:00,12766,"Nice looking fishing rig you picked up  there  Cliff, infact VERY nice, you'll be set for a long time now !!"
625129,Victor,2011-09-26 21:07:00,1609,"Congrats on the sweet ride old guy! (I'm younger than Mike  ) Being a console owner I also had to shake my head when I saw the pics  Make sure you inspect the package closely if you are buying the fuel line from CTC. Some of them has kinks in it, and I found out the hard way."
625139,GBW,2011-09-26 21:38:00,8460,so now I can say nice boat...  haha  is it BOQ bound?
625154,limeyangler,2011-09-26 22:33:00,5204,That there is the bestest little boat!  I'd love a neat set up like that.   Nice Mushkaays too Cliff.
624578,ccmtcanada,2011-09-24 20:16:00,7971,"I have been boatless for a little bit but always had that itch to get one again.  With money extremely tight, it didn't look like it was in the cards for me for this summer.  That is, until I went up to visit my cousin up on Paudash Lake in July!  He mentioned to me that he had a little 14 ft tinny that he'd sell me cheap.  He got it for his kids about 10 years ago and they hardly ever used it.  For the past few years he said it had only seen water maybe 2 or 3 times a year.  He went and got the boat to show me and this is what I saw...    I thought to myself...wow...it looks great!  It's a 14 foot tinny...wide 68"" beam, and he said he had some home made removable flooring made for it.  The 30hp engine on it is more than enough power to make it boot right along in the water!  Since I got the boat for a great deal, there were a few things I could now afford to get...a fishfinder and if possible, a used bowmount trolling motor.  A fellow OFNer was selling a never before used motorguide 46lb thrust foot control model that I could not pass up on!  It was a great deal and included a heavy duty deep cycle battery.  First order of business was to install that!   I then went up to Bernie's place with a bunch of guys and stopped in at the family business.  I asked Bernie's brother about boat seats and bases and he brought out a bunch of stuff.  He then proceeded to knock over 50% off the price...a deal I couldn't refuse!  Bernie had an old seat and base laying around the cottage and he graciously donated that to my cause.  Then Fishnsled came out to the house to help me with placement and to install them.  He also brought a few bases with him to see if they'd work...and they did.  He also wouldn't accept any money for them!  Here are some pics of the boat ready for the water.  I can't thank Fishnsled, Bernie and his brother enough!       Now that it was all ready to go, I just needed to get out on the water.  Fishnsled would be my passenger on my maiden voyage!  He got here at 545am this morning...we still hadn't decided on what lake we would go to.  Here it is...waiting to get on the road!   We made plans in the car to go to Scugog to see about fishing the north end...but 2 minutes before we were to turn, we decide to keep on going! LOL.  We ended up a little further north and launched the boat.  Ahhh..it felt so good to get her in the water!  I had a little trouble starting up the engine, but finally got it going.  As I was priming the bulb, I noticed a pin hole leak in it...we figure an air bubble worked it's way inside and it took a little bit of work to get it through.  Once it did, it fired right up and there were no issues at all for the rest of the day.  On my shopping list is a new fuel line from the tank to the engine!  We were finally on our way...the 30hp motor pushed the boat along at 40km/hr.  Plenty of power for a 14 foot tinny!  It was overcast and cool, but a nice day to fish!  There were NO other boats on this lake!  Fishnsled throws a jig and twister tail on and I'm throwing some weightless presentations for bass.  He caught the first fish in the new boat...this little perch!  He was a little excited! LOL   Because this was my boat, I warned him that it would take a little getting used to me using the trolling motor...and he complained the whole time LOL.  See what it's like not being at the front of the boat???  A little bit later, Fishnsled notices a cloud in the distance and says ""I better put on my GORETEX rainsuit on that I got from Cabelas"".  I roll my eyes...look to the sky...and don't bother with my frog toggs.  He then hooks into a little bass.  This fish was almost lunch it seems to something big and toothy!  Take a look at the scars on the side of this fish!   We didn't have a lot of time out there today as my fishing partner had to leave early, so we decided to cast for some muskie.  We hit the spot a few minutes later and on the first cast, I hear ""Fish on!! Hit 10 feet from the boat!"".  A quick fight and he lands the first muskie of the day!   Just as we were packing up for head back to the launch, I'm casting out a husky jerk...a last ditch effort of sorts, when suddenly I feel something pull back!  It wasn't a big fish, but I was very happy to see my first muskie in the new boat!!  The colours and markings on this fish were great!   Well, with a successful day of fishing in the books, we headed back to the boat launch.  Fishnsled silently took off his GORETEX rainsuit remarking ""see how dry it kept me?"" as the sun came out! "
624582,Joeytier,2011-09-24 20:35:00,3990,Awesome rig!  That thing is set up perfect.
624583,adolson,2011-09-24 20:38:00,783,"Nice boat, and nice fish!"

624597,spincast,2011-09-24 21:52:00,3279,"great report - sweet job on the boat, and congrats on slimin her first time out"
624606,cranks bait,2011-09-24 22:29:00,721,I used a buddy of mines boat that is the same thing.  I was very impressed with how stable it was.  Great setup.  Nice to see it teased and slimed!!!!!
624657,Rizzo,2011-09-25 00:59:00,4754,"that was a great read. Beauty boat too! If I saw a bass with scars like that I would DEFINITELY be pulling out the musky gear. Looks like the first musky might have hit a ""bobby""?"
624661,Terry,2011-09-25 01:10:00,14456,nice boat
624662,ccmtcanada,2011-09-25 01:12:00,7971,Thanks everyone!  I'm pretty excited about the boat...loving the trolling motor I have to say!  MTP...of course it's a tiller!  Rizzo...you are correct on the lure  I was bound and determined that the first fish wasn't going to be a panfish...so I threw bigger baits all day long.  It was literally the last cast of the day on a smaller husky jerk that hooked that little guy!
624663,ccmtcanada,2011-09-25 01:13:00,7971, (Staring at your avatar) ........... ........... ........... ........... ...........  I am at your command...

624703,ccmtcanada,2011-09-25 03:04:00,7971, Hey...I think you are right!  Take me to a brook trout stream and all is forgiven MJL.
624705,ccmtcanada,2011-09-25 03:06:00,7971," There are scratches on the paint of the boat from my cousins kids scraping it along docks, but there are no leaks at all.  He made the trailer himself and it's SOLID!  The motor has maybe 10 hours on it!  Thanks for the post Roy...I do have it ""happening""...dude"
624706,ccmtcanada,2011-09-25 03:08:00,7971,"Yep!  Couldn't have done it without all involved!   Thanks Joey!  Will and Bernie are great friends   Thanks!  Was a great day!
