Its been a long wait and even longer (well not really) since I got back to the Fort. Southern Ontario has its attributes but holds nothing on the magesty of NWO. 9 working days and counting!!!!  SEE YA!!!

622025,DT10Sam,2011-09-16 11:09:00,480,"Yes it is that time of year when all hunters are anxiously waiting to go on a moose hunt. This morning I see that we got hit with our first good frost here in Eastern Ontario and that will sent everything into hunting mode and feeling good for all hunters. The joy of the fall season are about to begin. Enjoy your scouting and hunting adventure and return home safe with some good pics and hunting stories to tell.  Regards, Sam"
