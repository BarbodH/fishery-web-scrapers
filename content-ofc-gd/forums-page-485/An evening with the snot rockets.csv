Did get the opportunity to play with the underwater camera housing again. Got a good clip of a crayfish too from yesterday afternoon when playing with my boy on our shoreline.   Just jigs and spinners with minnows, a couple of minutes with a crankbait got another pike.   Anyway...here's the vids.

625257,Moosebunk,2011-09-27 02:44:00,3970,Odd you posted that crayfish underwater. Out fishing tonight with a buddy and he was getting walleye on a crayfish immitation while we were bass fishing.  Cool camera fun Simon.
625320,johnnyb,2011-09-27 13:03:00,3413,Easy to see why they call them rockets.....man that first pike just disappeared in an instant!  Fun times
625334,limeyangler,2011-09-27 13:31:00,5204," I should get better at this underwater stuff...hopefully get some good shots. I need to get out with a buddy though as trying to film underwater on your own is not so easy.  By the way Terry...that Avatar has melted part of my left eyeball    Thanks Dave    Lol...the bloody thing cost more than the camera Paul!   LOL...soon...patience young Skywalker.    The weather has been crazy good up here...been at work mostly...but when i do get out the walleye are in a funny mood.    Hey Corvy, i enjoyed it too. The walleye have been in a funny mood so i made the concious decision not to stress if they did not come out to play and just enjoy non stop pike fun on a gorgeous evening if need be,    Thanks doood.   Thanks Northern!   Thanks Drew, sounds like you are having more success with the walleye than me...lol.   The thing flew eh?"
