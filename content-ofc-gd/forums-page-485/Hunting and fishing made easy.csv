625594,registerfly,2011-09-28 00:38:00,198,ok I'm slow and had to listen to it mute but why is the deer wearing a vest??
625600,Roy,2011-09-28 00:43:00,13728, Be cause it's someone's pet and somewhat domesticated.  Also it was written into Jane Doe's script for the clip.
625614,jedimaster,2011-09-28 00:55:00,3472,He shoulda carved it up and wrapped up a bacstrap in the vest and mailed it back to the owner. Haha
