625037,mike rousseau,2011-09-26 17:05:00,4661,ive been told 16-18 bucks per foot...  so  320-360... per boat...  this is why i suggest a boat cover... you can get a good one for around 250-500 bucks...  that way you get to reuse it...  why pay the same amount or more for something you throw in the trash every year...?
