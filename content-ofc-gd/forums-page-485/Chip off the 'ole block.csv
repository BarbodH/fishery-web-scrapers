They are weird and funny and become the 'in' joke at work for a while until another one is discovered . At the moment the video we laugh about is a weird kid singing his own song....""Chocolate Rain"".....   <iframe width=""420"" height=""315"" src=""http://www.youtube.com/embed/EwTZ2xpQwpA"" frameborder=""0"" allowfullscreen></iframe>     I guess i sing it more often than i realise, and make a silly face while doing it...cuz my wife got Jack singing it on video for me last night .....sooooo funny....tooo cute...if not a little weird.   <iframe width=""560"" height=""315"" src=""http://www.youtube.com/embed/apgMIK30PZs"" frameborder=""0"" allowfullscreen></iframe>"
