625827,Rod Caster,2011-09-28 15:54:00,5784,I know where that wasp nest is located  
625830,whitbyboatguy,2011-09-28 16:00:00,130," When I was a kid there was a guy on my street with an estimated IQ of 80-90. He was a big guy. He thought it was hilarious to blow up frogs, fish and just about any other animal with firecrackers. I know that others find doing the firecracker thing to animals to be funny too.  I read that Wikipedia quote you posted.....recreational drollery sounds right. Time to leave the bar for better company   Yep....GBW has caused a stir in WBG"
625832,Headhunter,2011-09-28 16:02:00,5703,"  You're gonna be fun to be around in January, aren't you? HH"
625833,GBW,2011-09-28 16:02:00,8460,i hope he comes to a G2G
625834,whitbyboatguy,2011-09-28 16:05:00,130, I have seen evidence that with many posters on this board the IQ drops with the temperature. I certainly won't be around for that. I already know that the internet can't cure stupid so there is no use it me pointing stupid out.
625837,Spiel,2011-09-28 16:06:00,9065,Internet detention......
625547,GBW,2011-09-27 23:01:00,8460,more to follow later if the Mrs finds out...
625548,irishfield,2011-09-27 23:03:00,26272,Generally the paper wasps make a big ass nest and attach to the holes in the vented soffit.. not on the facia. Might be worth looking in the attic as I bet they're crawling thru the crack at the eve and are inside as well....
625550,GBW,2011-09-27 23:09:00,8460,this is how I know the Mrs will find out.  missfire in the laundry room...    *edit to fix image*
625551,irishfield,2011-09-27 23:15:00,26272,Dreaded red x... looks like she's already marked her spot.
625552,OhioFisherman,2011-09-27 23:16:00,6623,"Cable tie a can of raid flea fogger to a pole that will reach the nest, the can will lock in an on position and it kills yellow jackets too. You might need to do it twice, but in the evening just before dark when most are in the  nest.  A paintball gun, bb gun, soft pellet gun, slingshot with break or crack vinyl siding if you miss."
625555,GBW,2011-09-27 23:21:00,8460,now you tell me...      either way I got rid of it.
625557,mercman,2011-09-27 23:26:00,7054," Oh man Geoff......you have been a naughty,naughty boy. Love to be a fly on the wall in the GBW house when the wife saw that Its i thing of beauty !!  I cant stop starring at that pic"
625635,wallyboss,2011-09-28 01:35:00,1095,Like some said.  All you need is a cold morning and knock it off the house with a pole.  A propane torch is handy when it falls  The flames burns their wings and they drop instantly.  I used to be the crazy guy at work who would get rid of all the nests.
625672,GBW,2011-09-28 02:33:00,8460,I did manage to survive the evening/night but not to sure about the morning.  I'll let you know if I make it.  that and if the house has/had a fire burning in the roof that we didn't know about.
625675,mercman,2011-09-28 02:39:00,7054,Reminds me of the time i got all sauced up and went pigeon hunting in my my ex father in laws barn.I didnt notice the nice holes i blew through the roof with the 12ga. untill i sobered up. He always watched me like a hawk after that. Never let me in his barn again
625676,GBW,2011-09-28 02:43:00,8460,well this was/is my 'barn' and I'm sober so go figure...
625678,Mike Gray,2011-09-28 02:45:00,3,Should of called me Geoff.....remember the guy that bought the rod and reels from you last year (me) i'm an exterminator......
625679,GBW,2011-09-28 02:47:00,8460,D'OH! Yeah Mike I should have! But I'll PM ya later...
625690,young_one,2011-09-28 03:53:00,620,LOL   Good aim!
625786,GBW,2011-09-28 14:37:00,8460,"well, the Mrs wasn't mad at all...  in fact she's happy I got rid of it.                 to bad all the pic's are a joke because I got up on a ladder with an extension pole and knocked it down..."
625790,whitbyboatguy,2011-09-28 14:46:00,130, I think you are kidding us right? -you shot gasoline at your house? -you misfired a ball in the house and caused that damage to vent inside? <--I can't see a paintball doing that to plastic. -your plan was to light it on fire after it hit the ground? -a powerwasher was a far safer and less dramatic way to do this but you chose to use gasoline in paintballs?
625792,GBW,2011-09-28 14:48:00,8460,I think you missed the bottom of page 2...
625794,whitbyboatguy,2011-09-28 14:53:00,130,"  yes. I missed that one liner at the bottom of page 2 where you said you were fact full of it. thanks for pointing it out, was there even a nest? Other of your posts seem to be made up....care to point out which ones?"
625795,Flappn,2011-09-28 14:54:00,245,"The fake wasp nests you can buy to replace with the real one you knocked down don't work. I live in the country and deal with these buggers all the time. I had a wasp nest inside my daughters play house. I sprayed at night, knocked it down and hung up the fake wasp nest right beside where the real nest was. Well guess what, they built another. Blew that theory right out the window.  I have stocks in CIL Wasp and Hornet Spray. It works amazingly because it sends a foam spray a good distance in a straight line. I have had to hit nests at least 15 - 20 feet in the air (Top of the barn) and got them. The foam completely seals the nest, kills them and then you knock down the nest. DO IT AT NIGHT THOUGHT!! You have to knock down the nest though as another bunch of wasps will take it over and rebuild. I knocked one down and left it on top of a pile of wood...and the wasps re built the nest right where I left it."
625797,GBW,2011-09-28 15:00:00,8460,yes there was a nest 40' off the ground. that's for me to know and you to keep on guessing...
625800,whitbyboatguy,2011-09-28 15:05:00,130, Actually I wont guess. I will just assume you are full of it and not worth your word at all.  I will probably call you on things quite a bit. As I have already said many of your posts are suspect.  Nice going confessed liar. Make sure you put that fact in your sig so others don't have to waste time with advice you give posts you start.  WBG  PS....I don't believe you had a wasp nest up there. No reason for me or anyone else to believe it was anything more than you trying to get attention.
625808,GBW,2011-09-28 15:25:00,8460,"you can ASSume all you want to.  show me where I have lied in the past?  I did have a nest 40' up and was not able to find a pole long enough online a home depot or other stores close to me.  would you want to be 20' off the ground on a ladder with a nest 20' from you?  I think not.  However I was able to borrow a 20' pole and I used a 8' rod tube taped together so all I needed to be was on a 12' ladder so if I needed to jump I could.  so please o wise one, where on other posts have I lied?"
625809,Headhunter,2011-09-28 15:26:00,5703,"Humour or humor (see spelling differences) is the tendency of particular cognitive experiences to provoke laughter and provide amusement. The term derives from the humoral medicine of the ancient Greeks, which taught that the balance of fluids in the human body, known as humors (Latin: humor, ""body fluid""), control human health and emotion.  People of all ages and cultures respond to humour. The majority of people are able to experience humour, i.e., to be amused, to laugh or smile at something funny, and thus they are considered to have a sense of humour. The hypothetical person lacking a sense of humour would likely find the behaviour induced by humour to be inexplicable, strange, or even irrational. Though ultimately decided by personal taste, the extent to which an individual will find something humorous depends upon a host of variables, including geographical location, culture, maturity, level of education, intelligence and context. For example, young children may favour slapstick, such as Punch and Judy puppet shows or cartoons such as Tom and Jerry. Satire may rely more on understanding the target of the humour and thus tends to appeal to more mature audiences. Nonsatirical humour can be specifically termed ""recreational drollery"".[  Just so yah know... HH"
625811,GBW,2011-09-28 15:29:00,8460,"And just to add, do you think anyone would take the 'burn it' posts for real?  come on!  who in the world would be so dumb to take a torch to a house that they didn't intend on burning down?  I think I like my house thank you..."
625825,whitbyboatguy,2011-09-28 15:52:00,130," I have read some of your other posts on here and elsewhere. So yes. Yes I do believe that you might think it is a good idea to burn a wasp nest that is attached to you house. I am being sincere, I can all but guarantee some idiot has burned their house down in a similar scenario.  I even have doubts that those are pictures of your house. Your credibility sucks.  And before you go on calling me an ASS. Some assumptions are good assumptions to go on. Assuming the content of your posts are false is a good one. You yourself stated that people will not know when you are lying and would have to keep on guessing if your posts were true.  It is a fishing board....why don't you tell some fish stories about fish and keep the other stuff real? The other stuff is not funny or amusing."
625411,GBW,2011-09-27 16:17:00,8460,Hey all.  I need some ideas on how to get a wasp nest down from the peak of my house that is 40' off the ground.  I don't have a ladder to get up that high and I don't want to go out the door on the 2nd floor (it's now ready for winter).    Are there any telescopic poles that long out there?  Thanks.  G
625412,smally21,2011-09-27 16:20:00,993,there are painting poles and hydro switching poles that are very long - you could just bash it with one.  another idea is a hoseline or pressure washer....  i was gonna say 12 guage with some 8or 9 shot but its tough on the soffet...
625413,ketchenany,2011-09-27 16:22:00,3229,"Power washer!  GBW, you have thing for wildlife!"
625417,GBW,2011-09-27 16:42:00,8460,I was even thinking of my paintball gun or an air gun with the new plastic bb's.  I tried the PW from on top a 12' ladder and no luck.  how did you know my wife was/is like that?!?!?  you been talking to Wayne?!?!??!
625418,mercman,2011-09-27 16:42:00,7054,"Where do you live!!?? In the middle of the bush ??? Geese, hornets....Sheesh X2 for the power washer.Set to full stream.Make sure no one is around, and you have a clear escape route planned out. When they are pissed, they can follow you for a mile.  "
625419,strakey,2011-09-27 16:44:00,78,I was thinking the same thing.......BB gun with some good aim.  Good luck with that situation
625420,GBW,2011-09-27 16:45:00,8460,"let's not forget the Yote's, the rainbow & brook trout and and the other crazy amount of other birds.  I don't live in the bush either but I would love too..."
625422,LucG,2011-09-27 16:51:00,779,Use a slingshot  Good luck!
625423,mercman,2011-09-27 16:53:00,7054,"only other thing i tried once Geoff, I had Wasps once, took a very long painters pole, tied a big wad of newspaper to the end.Lite the paper and let burn for a couple of seconds. Snuff out the flame and place the smoking newsparer directly below the nest.It will flush them out, but be carefull they dont come after you.I had a friend with me riding shotgun with the power washer, picking them off as they came at me. Other option is the Orkin Man."
625428,otter649,2011-09-27 17:03:00,118,If possible try & remove after dark less activity by the wasps than during daylight hours.....
625429,Dozer,2011-09-27 17:03:00,896,How about getting it from on top of the roof rather then from the ground?
625434,DanD,2011-09-27 17:22:00,2223,12 gauge and a shell filled with course table salt; we use to do that when we found nests in the tobacco kilns. It would mar the paint a bit but not hurt the wood soffit of the building. I know it’s your house; so make up two shells and take a pot shot at something you don’t care about first and check it out?  Dan.
625435,ccmtcanada,2011-09-27 17:25:00,7971,"Wasps become dormant at around 50F (10C).  Can you wait until the weekend?  Forecast temps are supposed to go down to 4C on Sunday morning.  That way you can get on the roof and knock it off the house without having to worry about them coming out an attacking you!  BTW...if you try that, give me a call...I want to videotape it...LOL"
625436,ketchenany,2011-09-27 17:32:00,3229,
625438,Roy,2011-09-27 17:45:00,13728,"You'll only have another take its place. Cliff is right about the temperature though. When the temps get to the low 40's/high 30's, wasps get lethargic. They'll stay in the nest and won't move. If you don't want another nest being built there next year, they sell plastic nests that you hang in the place of the one you're removing. Wasps are territorial and will not populate an area where other wasps have settled. Oh and regardless of the temperature, the best time to be handling a wasp's nest is after dark."
625440,Joey,2011-09-27 17:49:00,9122,Blow torch duct taped to a long pole would be my choice  Remember to light it first
625441,cram,2011-09-27 17:50:00,1733,Good opp to test out your casting skills. Hook your favorite bait into it and pull it down.  Even more impressive if you can do it with a fly rod.
625447,davey buoy,2011-09-27 17:58:00,5505,"I like hornet blaster at dusk,pick it up anywhere.It has a long saturated direct spray.Next day take a long pole and knock it down. Worked for me several times.(except the time I ran my lawn mower over a ground nest,that hurt,maybe 10 stings,did not see it)"
625453,Cookslav,2011-09-27 18:21:00,1457,"Being its attached to your house I highly recommend against any flaming options and from the roof is not a great idea incase you miss and they get pissed off....good luck scambling down a latter with 100 hornets on your trail.  Painters pole has my vote...plenty of distance between you and the next and it will be effective, not to mention you can re-use the pole next year when they re build LOL..."
625458,Harrison,2011-09-27 18:27:00,2202,I'd move.
625461,mercman,2011-09-27 18:36:00,7054,   good thing you said that......
625462,BCLT,2011-09-27 18:42:00,86,"spray it with a hose until its soaked, at about 6 oclock, on a night its going to be close to freezing overnight - then throw tennis balls at it until it falls down - put a garbage can right under it and let it fall right in! tie up the bag and off she goes!  "
625537,pikehunter,2011-09-27 22:30:00,1659,Sounds like a job for  Billy  
625538,woodenboater,2011-09-27 22:37:00,2277,"It's kinda taking the long, roundabout route and more work but if you have attic crawl space behind the nest, drill a hole, stick a straightened coat hanger through it and whack away. Like I said, not the simplest or easiest way but that's me  or buy an RC helicopter, buzz it close to the nest and chop away with the blades, might as well have some fun no ?"
625545,GBW,2011-09-27 23:01:00,8460,"ok, so I took all the advise here with a grain of salt and decided to do what I figured was best.  took some older paintballs and put some gas in.  had a buddy hold up a lit blowtorch while I pulled the trigger.  I got it in one shot, yeah baby!!!  Here is the final result.  "
