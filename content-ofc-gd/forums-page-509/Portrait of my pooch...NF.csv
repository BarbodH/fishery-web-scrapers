Besides the cartoons she is also  extremely talented at drawing animals, especially horses, but she does an incredible job on dog portraits also.  I talked to Maureen awhile back about doing a portrait of my little buddy Marvin. I sent her a favorite photograph of him and she took it from there. I picked it up a couple days ago and thought some of you dog lovers may be interested in seeing it.  The picture is 20"" X 25"" and is in a portrait shop in Lakefield right now having a custom frame made for it. It'll then hang in the living room.  It looks even better in person than this photograph but you'll get a pretty good idea of the talent involved in doing this.  "

605759,Lake Ranger,2011-07-24 13:29:00,70,"Gee, thanks everyone for such inspiring comments! I really don't know what to say other than thanks Lew for posting this, I'm really happy to hear there is a likeness and that you're happy with the pooch portrait! Marvin was a fun guy to draw so that always makes the job easier! Sorry about missing out on the touque though, I figured since it's summer he would be fine without it."
605779,Rattletrap2,2011-07-24 15:16:00,1652,"What a beautiful portrait of Marvin. something to keep for a lifetime! Maureen, that is some awesome talent you got going there! The life in his eyes is fantastic!"
605782,John,2011-07-24 15:25:00,2956,"I posted this a while ago, but just to give you another perspective of Maureen's talent.  My beloved Benson who we lost a year and a half ago and his best buddy Chloe.  "
605783,markiemark70,2011-07-24 15:28:00,158,You have a really great talent. Also I am amazed that you got them to sit still for that long!!
605796,Beans,2011-07-24 16:39:00,3339,"That's just marvelous of Marvin...  Thanks for posting Lew...  I'll be adding it to my ""animals"" screen saver..."

605893,lew,2011-07-24 23:15:00,12766,"Thanks for all the positive replies about the picture folks, I'm really looking forward to getting it back from the framer & hung up in the living room."
605944,TennesseeGuy,2011-07-25 02:26:00,957,Circulating Marvin's portrait might help get him a little action in the neighborhood.  Shouldn't hurt any.
