I had very little confidence in this technique and it would take some convincing to keep at it. Well after a few depth and colour tweeks we got onto something. After lighting up the fish last week Lindy rigging and jigging, we found out what some bigger fish wanted....cranks.  They crushed them!    Sure, I've got a lot to learn before dialing this right in, but its a very good start.  Next time your out fishing, pick a technique you want to learn and stick with it...its all about expanding your arsenal as an angler to consistently improve your odds of catching more and bigger fish."

606424,troutologist,2011-07-26 19:14:00,951,"  All about crashing bottom and pulling the cranks off structure, notice which hook the fish in the pic came on....hitting it from below, this was consistent."
