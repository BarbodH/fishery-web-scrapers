606223,nroadrunner,2011-07-25 23:28:00,113,"Hey Guys and Gals  I am trying to locate a battery box.  I have been borrowing my neighbours time to get my own, trouble is i can not locate one.  The one I am looking for has terminals on the outside with wingnuts so I do not have to open the battery box to hook up my trolling motor.  I have tried a couple marinas locally with no luck so any help is appreciated.  I am located in Baysville would drive to barrie or north bay if I had to or purchase online.    Thanks    Ian"
606225,mercman,2011-07-25 23:35:00,7054,like this one?  http://store.minnkotamotors.com/products/418930/Trolling_Motor_Power_Center
606229,nroadrunner,2011-07-25 23:44:00,113,Yes sir exactly like that one.   And that is why I posted it here I knew someone would know where to look.  I feel like an idiot as my motor is minkota and I never thought to check their site.  Luckily for me its not the first time and probably won't be the last. LOL    Thanks
606264,206,2011-07-26 01:16:00,563,Not to promote them but walmart carry's these....just sayin' cause there seems to be walmarts everywhere now
606265,mercman,2011-07-26 01:19:00,7054,"Got mine at Sail.64bucks. Has 2 12volt outlets(handy) and a battery charge tester integrated, and 2 overload protectors, resetable."
606290,nroadrunner,2011-07-26 02:20:00,113,"206  yes there are walmarts everywhere but unfortunately they do not all carry the same stock and the 2 near me do not have any.  Thanks for the help mercman, I have sent an email to Tromblys Tackle box which is about 50 min from me to see if they have any as they are a minkota dealer.    Ian"
606294,skeeter,2011-07-26 02:38:00,1907,"Wow, I didnt realize they were that expensive. I found one sitting beside the dumpster in march. Tested it and it works perfectly. It is now sitting in my boat with my battery in it, guess I better lock it down."
606301,mercman,2011-07-26 02:49:00,7054, Ah Shut up
606302,nroadrunner,2011-07-26 02:52:00,113,YEAH what he said  LOL
606304,irishfield,2011-07-26 02:55:00,26272,
606305,skeeter,2011-07-26 02:56:00,1907,"Seriously, I did. It has 2 outlets on the front that I cant figure out what they are for. They are the same as headphone cord plugs."
606306,mercman,2011-07-26 03:00:00,7054,  thats were the resets are sposed to go.circuit breakers
606308,skeeter,2011-07-26 03:07:00,1907,"It has a fuse built in , but these are two headphone jacks, and the 2 jacks were still in the box, ready to hook something up to them?"
606318,adolson,2011-07-26 03:42:00,783," Did you try plugging in some headphones? Maybe there's a secret message recorded inside the box! Perhaps a clue as to why it was thrown away? Maybe the box is cursed! You will never know until you plug in some phones and giver a listen!   ---  I never even considered a box for my battery before. Is there any reason I *should* have one? I only use my battery for my trolling motor, which has a battery gauge built right in, which seems like the best feature on a box. And a handle, of course, which my battery already has."
606335,Jer,2011-07-26 11:07:00,1426,  You'll figger it out when the holes start appearing in your pants...
606374,mercman,2011-07-26 15:11:00,7054, It prevents accidentally dropping something metalic between the terminals.or accidental spillage of acid in your boat.
