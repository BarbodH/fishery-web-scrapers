605962,DRIFTER_016,2011-07-25 03:44:00,10439,Just when I thought I was done spending $$ on big ticket items for my ice fishing obsession this comes along.  
606117,Uncle Buck,2011-07-25 18:24:00,1000,Sweet...  anyone want to buy my LX5 and FL20?
606123,mercman,2011-07-25 19:06:00,7054,THAT is awesome. Do you think it will be the future for all Sonar units? The price would drop if it did.
606136,mike rousseau,2011-07-25 20:03:00,4661,Why did you have to show me that....  Damn toys!!!!!
606142,Terry,2011-07-25 20:16:00,14456,I see nothing over my HDS5..except on screen showing how far your signal goes out on bottom  the only real-time color LCD sonar unit ..bull what modern unit isn't real time on mine when I lift my jig it goes up the very nanosecond I start to lift it and same going down...can get more real time then that  it's a nice unit but I don't like flashers
606144,johnnyb,2011-07-25 20:19:00,3413,That's why I love fishing with Terry....he has all the necessary hardware....including a timer that measures to the nanosecond
606149,DRIFTER_016,2011-07-25 20:26:00,10439, Even a broken down old boat/trailer too!!!
606271,Fisherman,2011-07-26 01:37:00,7201,"Strange, nobody standing around this guy, I think it's the smell he's exuding, Called Eau de full of ______. I'm with Terry on this one."
606322,landry,2011-07-26 04:27:00,1005,"Terry is right - I use my elite 5 unit and compared to my buddies Marcum, I think it is better. Real-time, picks up jig well, and I put it back on the boat in March:) I love watching that gradual ski-slope line as the fish move up towards my jig from the bottom.  "
606344,canadadude,2011-07-26 12:21:00,769,"Wow, I gotta say this is one sweet unit, it covers all the bases, Flasher mode, chart mode or a colum type unit. This unit can be used as either type or a combination of the three, it's not just a flasher,it has all the bells and whistles anyone could ask for. A great unit for the high tech fishers who like to play with there electronics. The only things I don't like is the tranducer arm set-up, a floater is 100x better and easier, and I hate the interference that Marcum units give off, other then that it is one impressive machine."
606362,DRIFTER_016,2011-07-26 14:29:00,10439," I don't notice any interference, but then again I have an LX-5 Maybe if I had one of those VEX things I would have a problem with it. The issue is caused by the high power of the Marcum units. More power=better target separation."
