605894,BFSC Kevin,2011-07-24 23:17:00,1351,Depends on the application. But I use braided for all my baitcasters
605897,ecmilley,2011-07-24 23:22:00,2163,"depends on application, use mono on crankbait rods, use  braid for everything else with a flouro leader when tossing worms"
605925,Fang,2011-07-25 01:55:00,1330,"flouro on the crankbait/xrap rod braid for frog, pitching jigs 25 mono for worm in heavy mats and I like mono still on my spinnerbait, buzz bait rods"
605926,mike rousseau,2011-07-25 01:58:00,4661,I run braid on everything... Even crankbait rods... I helps for feel as well as depth... Only rods I put mono on are one of my musky trolling rods for trolling long lines in shallow water and my perch and bullhead rod
605935,umKthxbye,2011-07-25 02:09:00,247,I use braid on everything then tie a fluoro leader on. Better sensitivity with the no stretch and I don't feel like it will break off nearly as often as mono did for me.
605939,ChrisK,2011-07-25 02:14:00,2772,I have a light action combo that I use mono on.  . Mostly toss spinner baits and smaller crankbaits with it but all the other heavier action combo's have braid on them.
605955,DRIFTER_016,2011-07-25 03:01:00,10439,For most of my bait casters it's braid. I do use mono on a couple that I use for river fishing trout and char though. The mono holds up better around rocks. Braid tends to fray too easily and mono has more stretch which lessens the probability of pulling the lure away from the fish. Generally I'm bouncing heavy spoons along the bottom with this system.
605970,Cudz,2011-07-25 04:36:00,2652,30# pp for most applications 50# pp for frogin/pitchin/flippin in clear water I just tie on a 8' - 12' 8# fluoro leader.
