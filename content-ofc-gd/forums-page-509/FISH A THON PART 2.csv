605842,Spiel,2011-07-24 20:38:00,9065, 
605844,danbouck,2011-07-24 20:40:00,4380,meant to quote HTHM's post. Apparently they are bad luck
605846,asdve23rveavwa,2011-07-24 20:46:00,2690," I thought he was referring to the pic of you trying to kiss him! I like a good burger as much as the rest of us, but, really Dan..."
605852,bigugli,2011-07-24 21:19:00,6138,I'm glad the event turned out so well. My hat's off to you all.
605901,Handlebarz,2011-07-24 23:40:00,3790,I don't know if this will work but here is a video that I took sorry I did not get the thanks to everyone on it but the best part is there.  http://s157.photobucket.com/albums/t73/bellerivermci/?action=view&current=86c03e49.mp4  Here are a couple pics also.  Before everyone packed in.     Juli doing what she does best herding the crowd of 80+ before the two great shots above        And the long drive home the boy passed out chewing on some Dixie Tackle for the ride home  
605906,SRT8 smoker craft,2011-07-25 00:05:00,1107,Yep he's very happy with the rod and keeps reminding me about winning big fish LOL
605938,The Urban Fisherman,2011-07-25 02:14:00,2050,"Absolutely awesome photo gallery!  You guys are all unbelievably awesome!!!!! We have some serious thank you's to throw out there which I'll touch on tomorrow for sure - just got in from cleaning up bringing all the borrowed gear back to where we got it and then enjoying an evening back at the park with my family...even managed to spend about an hour on the water and bring some decent fish in the boat!!!  Thank you all - Juli, the pictures are awesome... gotta go deal with overtired kids who need to get to sleep...  Cheers, Ryan"
605941,asdve23rveavwa,2011-07-25 02:22:00,2690," Thanks, Ryan! It was the least Juli, and, I could do!  Working on getting ALL the photos downloaded onto a link that anyone who was there and wants pics, can access."
606020,The Urban Fisherman,2011-07-25 12:50:00,2050,bump!
606031,Spiel,2011-07-25 13:08:00,9065, I'm sure you'll being hearing about for some time Shawn.
606032,asdve23rveavwa,2011-07-25 13:12:00,2690,   That prize was well deserved. Big fish on a hard day of fishing!  Had it not been so skinny it definitely would have hit 6 lbs!!
606041,The Urban Fisherman,2011-07-25 13:28:00,2050,"SPIEL - here's the fish that won your rod! Third prize off the table... It was 22 inches which could have easily gone 6+ pounds but she was skinny.... still a great fish with a huge head... I'll post more pix tonight guys - got some catching up to do in the office!    Cheers, Ryan"
606048,fishnsled,2011-07-25 13:45:00,3520,Just awesome!!!  Congrats to all involved.
