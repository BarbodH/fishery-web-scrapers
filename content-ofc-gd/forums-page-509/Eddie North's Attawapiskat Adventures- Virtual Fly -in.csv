602943,Grimace,2011-07-15 03:11:00,2020,I would say so.  There is no such thing as a 41 inch Zander let alone Walleye.
602945,ChrisK,2011-07-15 03:23:00,2772,If there is I wanna do this trip for sure now
603046,BillM,2011-07-15 14:48:00,17367,"Come on boys, there are bigger gators in there then that!  Go get 'em!"
603484,Bassive,2011-07-17 03:02:00,58, YUP!
605416,Bassive,2011-07-22 17:39:00,58,"Very sorry for the delay in posting gents...I've beening trying all week and can't seem to get the pics to post. Can anybody help? I've added them to a Flickr account too and no dice.  thanks  Here are some tips of the crew's heading up to Eddie's soon.  1) Drink lots of water and/or sport drinks, with electrolytes. You can make your own by adding a pinch of salt to a juice bottle/water bottle.  I learned this one the hard way, the heat can be a killer. 2) GO SLOW!! The water level was way down low last week, and it's NOT a place you can go full open. 3) Johnson SILVER MINNOWS in Silver and gold!! Take a few of each size. (I lost my only big gold one to monster the first day) 4) Bring some coils to burn at night, as the skeeters can get bad. I hate them so i have a Thermacell I use at night. 5) The Y was excellent for walleye, but FULL of boulders. 6) Have fun, it was hot as heck when we where there but we all stayed cool with a few 'pops' from the 'fridge.   Thanks to Eddie, James and Solo for all of the help before and during the trip. The camp looks great!!  PM me if you'd like to chat. Ciao! Bassive  PS. Tons of walleye were caught, and a bunch of pike in the 40's and high 30's. The biggest for the week was a 45 incher. More to come when the pics get posted."
605417,BillM,2011-07-22 17:47:00,17367,"The Y is a great spot for walters.  It's not like you'd be going through there WOT anyhow, lol."
605429,Bassive,2011-07-22 18:17:00,58,    LOL...some tried and failed!
605436,BillM,2011-07-22 18:27:00,17367," Oh man, the giant boulders sticking out of the water should have given them a hint that more hid below the surface, lol."
606218,Bassive,2011-07-25 23:00:00,58,Check out the NEW POST WITH PICS!!! (finally!!)  http://ontariofishin...showtopic=55652
599068,Bassive,2011-07-04 00:58:00,58,"Here it is buds!!  What you've been waiting for My tackle selection for next week's trip to Eddie's. My spinners, spoons, raps, and jigs.  I've also got lots of trailers/plastics in all the fav colours..white, black, chartreuse, and yellow.  What do you think?? (the Coke can is for ref purposes, it's not a lure...yet) (Excuse the blur on the left side of the pics...my iphone camera is on not working so well)"
599093,DRIFTER_016,2011-07-04 01:57:00,10439, I don't see any silver or gold Johnsons Silver Minnows in there. Do not go up there without at least 1/2 a dozen in 3/4 oz and 1 1/4 oz sizes. Along with 4-5 inch twister tails or split double tails in white. Just sayin'
599140,Bassive,2011-07-04 03:26:00,58,"  Hey D! I've got 2, they're on the second pic. 1 1/4 oz gold and silver. I'll look into a few more.thanks!"
599144,DRIFTER_016,2011-07-04 03:36:00,10439, They were hiding in the corner.  LOL Make sure to pick up some 3/4 oz ones as well. I used more of them than I did the bigger ones.
599147,BillM,2011-07-04 03:40:00,17367,"Smaller ones with a big twister tail attached don't sink as fast and are easier to bring through the weeds.  If I only had one bait to bring up there, that's what it would be."
599152,danc,2011-07-04 03:58:00,4677,"Geez. We're talking about pike here guys. I've caught a bunch of them with my line not even in the water hanging over the side of the boat, having shore lunch. Bring an old boot, put some hooks on it and you'll be fine. Id like to see some tips on how not to catch them in this thread."
599153,solopaddler,2011-07-04 04:11:00,8605," There's a whole world of difference between small pike which I have no interest whatsoever in catching, and larger fish 40"" and up.  They're not all that common, and are a true apex predator and trophy. Especially anything 45"" and larger.  Rob you sure can talk buddy.  Nice chatting with you and all the best on your trip!"
599157,danc,2011-07-04 04:35:00,4677," Ive caught my share of 40""+ pike over the years, by accident. Nobody that I know that lives up here targets pike simply because they are everywhere and are considered a nuisance fish. Once in a while we even take a photo or two just for fun.  "
599187,aplumma,2011-07-04 12:12:00,6896,Thats too funny A friend of mine is an avid bassman and when we go fishing if he hooks into a big blue Catfish he cusses and tries his best to shake them off instead of enjoying the fight with a 20 lb or better fish. When I fish with other on the big boat we taylor the day to fish for those big beautiful fish.   Art
599199,Bassive,2011-07-04 13:19:00,58,"  HA..Yes I've been known to yap. Thanks again Solo, your avalanche of advice and tips will serve me well.  I agree with your comment, BIG pike are a different game. Small ones will hit anything I've found."
599200,BillM,2011-07-04 13:20:00,17367,"Dan, I'll try and take care of all those pike up there for you"
599374,Bassive,2011-07-04 23:44:00,58,I'm off to Bass Pro for some smaller Silver Minnows...anything else? Times a ticking away...
599602,Bassive,2011-07-05 17:10:00,58,3 more sleeps!!!
599604,Roy,2011-07-05 17:13:00,13728,Savour the anticipation as well. Looking forward to your report.
599768,danc,2011-07-06 00:58:00,4677," Bill. You're biggest was only 48"". And I haven't even told you where the big ones hang out yet."
599785,bucktail,2011-07-06 01:23:00,1857,"Some bigfish lures , big husky jerks, big muskie bucks, super shad raps, sebile magic swimmer, giant spinnerbaits and an extra pair of pliers and bandaids!!!"
599787,danc,2011-07-06 01:28:00,4677, Don't forget 1/4 oz. deer hair jigs on that list. That's what works for me. They really like them in any color that you can think of. So bring lots of those.
601050,Bassive,2011-07-10 02:48:00,58,"Here we are !! Day 1 Got here safe, sound and ready to fish!  Got out on the water just after noon for abit Wow, was the water level low. As the Beteau is part of a river system, it's highly prone to fluctuations. Lack of recent rain has lower it a fair bit. We had to reevaluate our game plan on the fly.  Yakpiker and I were fishing together for big pike and we found a decent spot.  The wind was stiff which made it challenging, however we decided to keep working it by drifting over with Johnson Silver Minnow (Gold). It worked quite well.  The hour produced several big hits. I landed one that was about 37 and another that was 35. They were FAT and hit like freight trains. Yak did well too, a 30 and 26. I had one hit so hard it snapped my 20LB PowerPro like it was 4lb mono. I did see it and it was in the 40s. We're going to try to him and my lure/leader tomorrow.  In all the haste i forgot my camera but will post some pics tomorrow.  Having had not more then 9 hours of sleep sleep in the past 3 days, I'm feeling dead tired to say the least.     I'll get some rest and post a more robust tomorrow.  ciao all and see ya soon. Bassive!!"
601055,BillM,2011-07-10 03:08:00,17367, I'll patiently await for that PM  :)
601079,Terry,2011-07-10 10:12:00,14456,hope to see some photos tomorrow  you should start a new thread for each day so we know you have new stuff posted
601154,walleye wanderer,2011-07-10 15:42:00,64," Hey Dan, I'm looking for the 50""er so do tell...lol. Rob"
601271,Bassive,2011-07-11 00:01:00,58,"quck post... The sun and heat got the best of me today.    (just kidding, just abit dehydrated. DRINK WATER BOYS!!! I caught a 27 then packed it in. Yakpiker is the man..Took care of me and caught a nice one today. 42! A bigger is out there waiting for us tomorrow. I'm feeling much better. Ciao"
602307,Bassive,2011-07-13 18:44:00,58,"And we're back!!!  Day 2.  I was still not 100% back to normal so I took it easy in the morning and YakPiker did well. A few in the high 30s. He's got determination.  The conditions were about to change... As the after noon began, the weather turned stormy, we took cover for abit and sat out the light show...after that the rain turn on and we packed it up for the day.  The other folks here did well too.   Day 3  It was a good day...  Two 34s, a 35 and a 38 and a 40....  As the bandwidth is limited using a satellite connection I'll have to post pics after i get back.  Stay tuned.. more to come.  Bassive,"
602920,Bassive,2011-07-15 02:19:00,58,"Fishing was good today!  We focused on walleye, and just smashed them....(and a 41 and 31 inchers)"
602935,ChrisK,2011-07-15 02:44:00,2772,Your talkin 41 inch pike right ?
598367,fishnsled,2011-06-30 21:30:00,3520,  I'll agree with that. Mike has helped out way more then one could ask. Really quite amazing what he has done for others and myself.
598382,Guest gbfisher,2011-06-30 22:41:00,0,  What's with the feeble threats....flip it up ya simp.
598408,EddieNorth,2011-07-01 00:43:00,64,"Ok get along girls,,,,,"
598413,Grimace,2011-07-01 00:56:00,2020,"With all do respect Eddie, the longer this went the better Mike looked.  Moderation is not in question here I do not think.   I think the intent to disrupt was pretty self evident here.  Your camp has looked better than fine here.  Has gotten rave reviews before and after your advertising.   It is safe to say you guys are looking pretty sharp and benefitting from this site.  As far as Mike goes, I think his reputation for helping people speaks for itself.   Whoever this dude is with the problem it would seem pretty obvious he us just punching people in the dark.  Don't sweat it.  I hope to get up your way one day.  Sounds awesome."
598415,Terry,2011-07-01 01:01:00,14456,I don't think it is quite like that  the thread was about a guy going to your camp but not about your camp   if the mods shut down every thread that someone said something that someone else doesn't like there wouldn't be many post and even less people visiting the site  I never say it but I think the mods here do a hell of a job balancing what should be removed or locked of left on the board  I read the thread and what doak did didn't take away anything about Bassive intentions in my eyes  and I didn't relate anything doak as to your camp in any way..IMHO  [/url]

598421,Terry,2011-07-01 01:12:00,14456, true  most of us learn to filter out the crap...or have fun with it .   but everyone here still drools over posts and pictures of your camp including me..... so no harm was really done .

598450,EddieNorth,2011-07-01 02:21:00,64,"On a side note we had a walleye caught last week that was 28 inches with a just under 24 inch girth,  It was a monster,,,,,Kinda looked like Daves bald head with a touque on it,,Hahaha "
598458,Roy,2011-07-01 02:39:00,13728,"A 24 girth on a 28 walleye? That's obscene! What's the forage in there Eddie, Twinkies and Big Macs?"

598518,donovac,2011-07-01 14:37:00,11,"  Yep, me and my buds are going up the first weekend.  Looking forward to Bassive's post to get me thru the end of July.  Don't know if I'll get to post before you go, but will definitely let you know what was working while we were there.  I got your PM today and will reach out to your somehow.  Solo, I haven't commented on any of this thread since doack's comments, but I have no doubt that you would help me out if I reach out to you.  You've done enough with your blogging about Eddie's place.  I've re-read your entries many times and it has kept me stoked for my first trip coming up.  Thanks for your posts.  I hope to add more great posts about Beteau and Eddie North.  GFTA (Good fishing to all)"
598524,Bassive,2011-07-01 15:23:00,58,"Thanks for the well wishes boys...My crew and I have great great plans to land many monsters and give Eddie a new camp record.  Stay tuned as I'll post a few pics over the weekend of my ""Eddie's"" tackle box. Any feedback would be appreciated.  HAPPY CANADA DAY!!"
598577,Jds63,2011-07-01 20:53:00,1365,oh how I look forward to reading the reports from Eddie's camps ... just hope I can make it next summer ..
598750,bronzeback,2011-07-02 17:04:00,30,"I'd like to echo the comments most have made about how helpful Mike has been when asked for advice.  My wife and I did our first fly-in trip last year to a lake in the Wawa area.  I sent Mike a message asking for a couple of tips on what might work best up there.  I wasn't sure if he would even have the time to respond as he seemed very busy at the time.  Much to my surprise, he replied with a detailed report of what should work and what to try if it didn't, as well as a host of other tips that we found invaluable. I happen to be Canadian but I'm sure his response would of have been the same whatever my nationality.  I don't want to keep this post going any longer than it should but I believe Mike to be one of the most helpful guys on this board and it's obvious most feel the same."

598292,solopaddler,2011-06-30 15:11:00,8605, What are you implying?
598303,tooski,2011-06-30 16:03:00,12,Not sure what he is implying. I'm from Ohio and Solo sent me a very complete and detailed summary of his previous fishing trip to Beteau. It was certainly more than I expected. Maybe it was meant in a joking manner?
598309,doack,2011-06-30 16:48:00,46, He Knows what I am implying...
598312,Guest gbfisher,2011-06-30 16:54:00,0,  Please elaborate.
598313,Terry,2011-06-30 16:54:00,14456,Solo is one of the most giving people on this site   So I don't think you are winning any friends today throwing crap like that out here...
598314,asdve23rveavwa,2011-06-30 16:58:00,2690," I have to agree with Terry.  Mike has never hesitated to send info/tips/suggestions. In fact I put a post on here earlier this year asking for info on a certain area from anyone that had been.  Not only did he answer, he sent me a long detailed PM on the area."
598315,Guest gbfisher,2011-06-30 16:58:00,0,  Terry....I'd like to read what the guy has to say.....    
598317,Grimace,2011-06-30 17:13:00,2020," Don't be a weiner.  It is a cowardly act to imply something without coming right out and saying it.  I am not saying you should air any laundry here, what I am saying is that you should probably take this up privately.  I asked the guy about my parents trip to Alaska and he took a great deal of time to let me know of plenty of options for them. As it turned out my parents didn't fish the Kenai River but did some camping in the area. They went after Halibut.  I still always appreciated the time he took.  I am sure there are plenty on the board with similar stories.  So there you have it."
598318,solopaddler,2011-06-30 17:21:00,8605,  I don't have a clue what you're implying and if I did I wouldn't hesitate to elaborate believe me.  I get countless inquiries from people on both sides of the border about Eddie's camp and otherwise.  I always try and help everyone.  Did you ask for help and I didn't come through? If so it was an oversight and I'm sorry.
598332,Bassive,2011-06-30 18:10:00,58,  Hey Doack.. Are you part of the Ohio crew that's going up on the 9th?

598352,doack,2011-06-30 19:38:00,46," Well, I can certaily start posting the pm's between us the last couple of years, just say the word.  I put it behind me,and even quit coming to the board, but I will tell you this, he is not a very truthful fella all the time..."
598353,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2011-06-30 19:42:00,0,save the drama for your mama.
598356,solopaddler,2011-06-30 19:51:00,8605,"  My friend I don't remember any conversation with you. Honestly I answer inquiries from people on a daily basis, sometimes VERY lengthy. Most times with a thank you for my time, many, many times without. Either way I'm fine with it.  I have a full time job, 2 young kids, pretty busy lifestyle but I do try my best.  I seriously don't have a clue what you're referring to and I mean that.  First you say I don't help Americans, now you're calling me a liar?  I have nothing to hide 'cause I know I've done nothing wrong. If you have something to say then by all means don't beat around the bash, SAY IT.  Feel free to pm me if you'd care to discuss your issue. If you want to continue this publicly I'm okay with that too."
