I'm not going to write alot here, just going to basically let the photos tell the story of the day.  Would love to put up a caption for each shot, but, unfortunately I still don't know everyone's names.  Thanks to Juli for doing a great job as our unofficial photographer for the day as chosen by Ryan!!  She was moving around like a ""whirling dervish"" in the heat, snapping these shots, way to go honey!!  What I will say is considering how much this event grew this year, it was amazing how well everything went.  It was great to see so many smiling faces on such a hot, muggy day!!  I also want to apologise to anyone whose picture isn't in this post, as well as any sponsors that don't appear here too.  Ryan will fill in the blanks on names, sponsors, and details.  We are also going to post a link to all the photos, so anyone that wants to copy/save photos of them and their friends and family can do so.  As of yesterday evening the total amount raised was $10 600 with, possibly, more to come!!!!  Anyways, enough of my yapping...here's the ""pics""                                                               Ryan's girls!!                                                            See part 2 for more pics and ""wrap-up"""

605822,asdve23rveavwa,2011-07-24 19:30:00,2690,"Thanks, Brian, Lew, Jacques and Joey.  The only regret I have for the day, is not getting everyone's names (probably would have forgot a bunch anyways, lol) and the fact that we had to cut the photos down to about sixty or so...out of over 300!!!!!!! Ryan will be chiming in when he gets a chance."
