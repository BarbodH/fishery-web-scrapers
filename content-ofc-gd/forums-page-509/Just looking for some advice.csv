What species are in the lake ??? Any tips on baits or techniques would be really appreciated haven't done much fishing this year and would like to catch something ...lol"
605507,danc,2011-07-22 23:44:00,4677,"You'd probably get some advice if you just introduced yourself first and eased into OFC rather than jumping right in and asking for fishing pointers. It's more or less an unwritten rule.  Welcome to OFC by the way. There's lots of good people here that are willing to help out. So, tell us a little about yourself."
605508,HTHM,2011-07-22 23:46:00,4082,The fishing is good just don't know about the catching though

605566,Gregoire,2011-07-23 04:54:00,1397,"Not a great start. Try listening to what people are saying. Introduce yourself, maybe outline what species you target, and if possible include a picture of a fish. We love fish porn."
605567,RyanT,2011-07-23 08:15:00,72,"I've heard it's a nice lake with good fishing.  i think you'll enjoy it... I've heard good stories about it.  I think it's funny that you call Golden Lake, ""going up North""!    My buddy from Belleville says the same when he comes up here to Ottawa.  I find it hilarious.  This area, Ottawa, Golden Lake, isn't ""up North""...  hahaha  Doesn't seem like The North to me at all.  Maybe drive for another 15 hours..."

605618,splashhopper,2011-07-23 18:53:00,2931," Welcome aboard George.  I don't think  you were ""fishing for info""  but just merely trying to start a conversation.  Post some pics if u have them of previous fish u caught.... A lot of us use www.photobucket.com to post our pics here.  Good luck on your trip too."
605620,wallyboss,2011-07-23 19:22:00,1095,Just find the small island with a cormorant colony and anchor on the West side of it and you will be on one of the best walleye spot on that lake.
605986,steelcitysoldier,2011-07-25 09:08:00,12,Hopefully i will have some pics to post when i get back ...I have some old pics just gotta find my memory stick. Thanks for the welcome.
605987,steelcitysoldier,2011-07-25 09:11:00,12,Thanks for the info wally. Any idea of any other species in the lake ??? I pretty much fish for anything that swims but given the choice I like to target game fish.
606247,wallyboss,2011-07-26 00:36:00,1095,I have only targetted walleyes on that lake.
606438,steelcitysoldier,2011-07-26 20:01:00,12,Thanks wally. I found this site http://www.web2.mnr.gov.on.ca/fish_online/fishing/fishingExplorer_en.html its pretty good. I heard some info is not so accurate though.
