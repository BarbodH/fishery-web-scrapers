605707,Grimace,2011-07-24 03:25:00,2020,Well done man.  We Hammered them the last night.  Sd:fly's spoons they did not care.  Highlight of the night was buying a guys parking ticket for 5 bones.  Woo Hoo we saved 12 bucks.  I forgot to give mine away this afternoon after our blue zone run.  Trade those tickets out folks.  Best way to get back at Oakville is to resell those tickets or just give  em away.
605711,icefisherman,2011-07-24 03:33:00,952," I would have done it no problem, but there was no one willing to launch at 9pm ;-) The stupid machine signed me up until 11:59 pm....what a waste of money...\ You idea is a good one...let's pass on those parking tickets...this is what the gready folks at Oakville town hall deserve.  Cheers, Ice Fisherman"
605713,Grimace,2011-07-24 03:46:00,2020,"  I am always so impressed when I go to other Ports and see the set ups they have and the difference in the feel you get when you use them.  Bronte is straight down 25 for me so that is where I launch.  No weigh station anymore with Bronte Outdoor Sports moving to that horrible location in Mississauga.  I drive by his empty store on the way home and it is troubling to see.  He had to move though, I heard they jacked the rent up on him pretty bad and would not let him downsize the store to a half unit.  Oh well.   Good Luck out there."

605874,DRIFTER_016,2011-07-24 22:34:00,10439,Emil I always used the launch at Lakeside Promanade Pk. at the Lakeview Gen Stn. Don't know what it's like now but it had 2 very nice ramps and lots of free parking. Plus it was 3 minutes from my house.
605875,misfish,2011-07-24 22:39:00,29133," When the tournys are running,thier there to collect yer cash Dave. Yes the launchs are nice.  Great report Emil.  TFS"
