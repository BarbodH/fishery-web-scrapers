605630,ld17,2011-07-23 21:20:00,319,"Hey guys, Im running P line fluoro coated line and im getting line twist.  What do you guys do to stop this? Thanks"
605633,Gregoire,2011-07-23 21:46:00,1397,Are you using a swivel? I have sworn off fluoro as a main line because of line twist problems.
605648,uglyfish,2011-07-23 22:59:00,981,"I only run straight 8lb flouro. Trilene 100%. Pretty sure the p line is a bit stiffer line. Line twist is unavoidable with drop shotting.  As mentioned a small swivel can help with it, but I believe u lose a little feel with that, and u add a knot that creates a weak point.  Also, learning to back reel will help eliminate the most twist."
605678,zeeter,2011-07-24 00:45:00,92,"This will solve your problem for line twist from drop-shotting.  Just came out at iCast.  It's called the ""spin-shot"" by VMC.  http://www.worldfishingnetwork.com/news/vmc-spin-shot-wins-best-terminal-tackle-117997.aspx"
605697,ld17,2011-07-24 02:06:00,319,thanks guys.  That vmc hook looks great.  Should stop all the line twist.  In the mean time I guess I will use a swivel and hope that helps the problem.
605717,Cudz,2011-07-24 04:32:00,2652,"tiny swivel about 12"" above hook.  Done"
605735,singingdog,2011-07-24 11:03:00,1047, Yep. Doesn't cut down on feel at all. Slowing down your retrieve when you bring it in for another cast will help as well. That's when most line twist occurs....I think.
605756,Garnet,2011-07-24 13:13:00,2056,Get Blackbird Accessory Swivels super tiny 30lb swivel and kiss the twist good bye. Look in the steelhead area.
605883,misfish,2011-07-24 22:51:00,29133,"  I use the same line, love it. At the end of my day,I just take all the tackle off,let out 100ft of line out in the water while moving ,for about 5 minutes.Reel back in ,and alls good."
605887,Terry,2011-07-24 23:00:00,14456,use a small baitcaster will help too
605889,misfish,2011-07-24 23:08:00,29133," Hey bud,tried that aswell.It does lessen the amount of twist,it still happens. I did try a swivel aswell,but still get it."
605898,ecmilley,2011-07-24 23:29:00,2163,"i use a small swivel out of my steelhead gear 15 lb power pro main line ans 8 -12 lb seagar leader line with phoenix or owner drop shot weights with the swivels as well matched with a drop shottin carrot stix and a shimano stella reel mostly perfect now, but tangled like crazy when i used flouro main line, best thing to reduce line twist is to stop catching little smallies"
605910,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2011-07-25 00:22:00,0,"it's a personal choice (and perhaps old fashioned) but over the years i've deemed fluoro mainline as garbage and not worth the hassle.  personally i'd prefer a traditional mainline with a 100% fluoro leader from 12"" to 3' in length and a micro swivel depending on the conditions."
605913,Terry,2011-07-25 00:38:00,14456, yeah doesn't rally stop line twist but bait casters handle twisted line much better
