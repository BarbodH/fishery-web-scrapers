605798,peter23,2011-07-24 16:51:00,95,"hey guys planning on going muskie fishing tomorrow and dont know where to go. im stuck between 2 lakes, pigeon and scugog. which one do you think i should go to? has anyone been having any luck latly?  thanks"
605803,lew,2011-07-24 17:30:00,12766,"Not much in Scugog other than little dink muskies, so if your looking for anything decent hit Pigeon or Upper Buck."
605808,ld17,2011-07-24 17:54:00,319,Pigeon would be my choice.  If you strike out on the muskie the smallies should cooperate.
605899,ecmilley,2011-07-24 23:33:00,2163,"tons of 30 inch skis in the bog if you want size though pigeon is my choice, some fat girls hanging off red rock and grandfather shoal"
605927,irishfield,2011-07-25 01:58:00,26272,Yep.. just dinks in the Bog...    
605932,Pigeontroller,2011-07-25 02:05:00,2793,That first guy looks angry...
605936,Grimace,2011-07-25 02:10:00,2020,"It would have been funny if pigeontroller said the bog.  Honestly though, go put the bloody hours in and you tell us.  Lol.   Good luck wherever you go.  Cheers."
605983,lew,2011-07-25 08:48:00,12766,That was a fun day Wayne..... until we had to retrieve your boat from the crooked ramp
605984,Gregoire,2011-07-25 08:53:00,1397, The fisherman or the fish?
605985,lew,2011-07-25 09:07:00,12766, Must be the fish cause I'M never angry when I'm fish'n
606074,ehg,2011-07-25 15:20:00,2666," I remember this post from Scugog it seemed like it was 4-5 yrs. ago. Think a few other musky were caught on this successful outing. Wow, time flies.  I would go to Pigeon though. The weeds at Scugog drive me nuts."
606081,irishfield,2011-07-25 15:41:00,26272,Yes Erik... I've just gotta say it one more time... FIVE for me.. one for Lew !
606112,mattybculp,2011-07-25 17:47:00,388,Pigeon in mho! Found that the north end of the lake is the way to go !
606295,Rizzo,2011-07-26 02:39:00,4754, ...somebody told him to pose with a 35 inch fish
606313,Uncle Buck,2011-07-26 03:27:00,1000,Quantity - Scugog Quality - Pigeon
606314,HTHM,2011-07-26 03:34:00,4082,"Well, look who he's fishing with....."
606428,linweir,2011-07-26 19:26:00,202,Totally different lake. They both have good size muskie. This time I probably go the Bog. In Fall I will try Pigeon and Buckhorn.
