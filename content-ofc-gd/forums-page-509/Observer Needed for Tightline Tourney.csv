606057,Aaron Shirley,2011-07-25 14:25:00,655,We need an observer for the Tightline tourney this weekend. PM me if interested. We will be able to take out our observer fishing.
606091,cranks bait,2011-07-25 16:35:00,721,When and where????  I might be able to be convinced?
606128,Aaron Shirley,2011-07-25 19:46:00,655,"It is this Saturday I think at 5am till 3:30pm at Bluffers Marina in Scarborough. The observer will need to be at the captains meeting at 6pm on Friday same place.  The observer would need to make the Friday night meeting, and show up early and observe in a tournament boat on Saturday. I believe the meeting is Friday at 6pm, not sure how long. Sat I think is at 5am to I think 3:30pm by the time it's finished. The loot bag typically goes to the observer and a free day out will be given by one of us to our observer. It's a chance to meet a bunch of great salmon anglers, get out for a day of pre-fishing (or whatever day works best for observer another time) and see first hand what a tourney boat does to try and win a big money tourney. A lot of great information on salmon fishing should be taken in by observers.  Here is the link to the tourney: Tightline Tournament  Bluffers  Let me know if anyone is interested, thanks!
