605623,davew3,2011-07-23 19:50:00,430,Good day folks.  My godson is coming down from Elliot Lake 2nd weekend in August and I plan on taking him out.  My question is what would be better odds?   Lake Ont out of Dalhousie or Lake Erie out of Port Colborne? I will be running dipsy's with assorted outfits.  I haven't been out of either and am not sure where the schools are right now.   It will also depend on the winds when we decide.  Any tips would be great.  Thanks
