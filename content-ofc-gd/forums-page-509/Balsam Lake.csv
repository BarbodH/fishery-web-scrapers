605608,Lakeshore,2011-07-23 18:09:00,56,"Just wondering if anyone can give me some advice on what the fishing is like on the lake, what I can expect. We will be there cottaging the second week of August, place called Hearts Landing, Coboconk. Any advice would be greatly appreciated!!"
605615,Gregoire,2011-07-23 18:39:00,1397,What are you looking to catch. Balsam has a lot of species.
605619,Lakeshore,2011-07-23 19:12:00,56,"I am up for anything really, I like fishing for Smallmouth/lLargemouth Bass, Walleye, Panfish, I have a couple of inexperienced anglers comping along and we will probably have to rent a boat, may have access to a fish finder.  I will be the one most responsible for doing fish finding research and scoping out opportunities. I would like to just make the week enjoyable as far as fishing goes, any help I could get would be very appreciative.  Personally I would like to get at a musky as I have never caught one of those."
605632,Gregoire,2011-07-23 21:44:00,1397,"I have only targeted Musky on Balsam. If you have all the proper gear, including landing and releasing gear, someone should be able to offer some advice. Apparently there is good bass fishing and some walleye as well. If you are going to be fishing with inexperienced anglers I would recommend targeting bass. I can't help you on that one though."

Good to keep some pike if you connect and eat them- they are really delicious and may help in the fight against pike- the thought is they will have a detrimental effect on Musky in time."
605660,sirfish,2011-07-23 23:41:00,175,ind the channel that goes through the lake for the bigger boats and fish the breaks. Always holding something..maybe even a ski !!
605754,Lakeshore,2011-07-24 13:05:00,56,Does anyoen know where I can buy or find on the internet a decent topo map for Balsam Lake??
