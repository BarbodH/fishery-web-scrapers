Last Saturday I volunteered for a Junior Bassmasters event on Gloucester Pool, we had a fun day despite the blistering heat.  We caught a lot of fish on flippin jigs and dropshots, but nothing of any real size. Still, we enjoyed it and I hope Nick learned a lot. Sunday the Barrie Bassmasters had a club tournament on Lake Simcoe out of Monto Reno in Lefroy.  I made a pretty long run and was immediately on fish, though my choice to target shallow fish kind bit me in the ass.  The fish were really spooky and I had a hard time getting bit.  I caught some fish and lost a couple of key fish then decided to go fish largies to at least put some fish in the boat. I ended up with just under 13lbs for a 4 fish limit which is dissappointing, but what can you do? Cant win em all. The excitement on Sunday came when my dad and his partner, Bill Walker came to the scales.  While everyone else struggled with the heat, they found a deeper honey hole and had a day that fishermen can only dream of.  The had all of their success dropshotting XZone slammers.  With a 4 fish limit each, they weighed 8 fish for 42.25lbs with their biggest 5 going over 31 lbs!!! Insane day with the big fish of the tourney going 7.55lbs a giant for July!!! This Friday I went to Couchiching to fish some new water and water I havent fished in years as the lake is always changing.  I had a good day fishing largemouth and got some good fish on film too, most success throwing crankbaits and LC Crankbaits.            And the video from Couchiching!  "
606009,Roy,2011-07-25 11:50:00,13728,WOW! That's a bowfin and a half! Excellent fish. And that's one heck of a day for your dad! Thanks for sharing.
606015,Harrison,2011-07-25 12:43:00,2202," Great report, Awesome!  I call the fish on the left a ""Procol Harum""  Cheers!"
606016,aniceguy,2011-07-25 12:43:00,1094,"your saying thier biggest 5 were 31, that means that there is an new record holder on Simcoe and the recent 30 lb bag from last year is no longer the simcoe record?"
606019,lookinforwalleye,2011-07-25 12:50:00,4399,"Nice bass for sure, Bill Walker sure has those big Simcoe smallies dialed in!  BTW some   stole your windshield!"
606021,Roy,2011-07-25 12:50:00,13728,Here we go....
606023,beginner,2011-07-25 12:52:00,542,always a great report as usual...
606025,Lunker777,2011-07-25 12:52:00,866,Thats what I was thinking
606034,steverowbotham,2011-07-25 13:15:00,1800," The bag from last year was 31.55 lbs for 5 fish. The way our club works is that each member weighs a 4 fish limit for 8 fish total per boat. Don and Bill had a 6.65, 6.50, 7.55 that were weighed individually for big fish. Bill had an appriximate 5.5 and a 5 in his bag... So their combined 5 (if our tournament ran that way) would have been a little over 31 pounds. Theres no one claiming a new record, just another unreal bag produced by lake simcoe."
606047,Roy,2011-07-25 13:44:00,13728, Thank you Steve.
