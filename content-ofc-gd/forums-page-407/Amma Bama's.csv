696767,Gregoire,2012-05-16 10:46:00,1397,"I was wondering if anyone has any experience using Amma Bama's or other hand made wood jerk baits for musky fishing. I recently had a chance to by some at a decent price, and I pulled the trigger. I was wondering if any one has these lures, and if they do, what the action is supposed to be like with them. I have head that they are worth the price due to the fact that the glide over almost on to their belly on the jerk, which can be a trigger for a strike. If you would be willing to share any experiences you have I would really appreciate it."
696773,Roy,2012-05-16 11:19:00,13728,"They're glide baits. Which size did you find? I think they run from 4 to 8""?"
696775,mike rousseau,2012-05-16 11:33:00,4661,My buddy has one... It has yet to catch him a fish....  But that's him...  For what they cost I sure hope you catch well on em...
696780,Gregoire,2012-05-16 11:50:00,1397," I got 2 8"" and 1 7"""
696784,kickingfrog,2012-05-16 11:59:00,8333,I used Rapala's gliding bait during my fly-in last September. The pike and walleye loved it. For a bait that size it trolled fairly easy hand held. Haven't used them for musky's.
696785,lew,2012-05-16 12:02:00,12766,That style of bait is often very good Greg as it has an erratic wobble that can be very enticing to a prowling fish.
697076,marine5068,2012-05-17 02:24:00,26,Lew's right. They are great baits to get unwilling chasing Muskies or some of the larger Muskies to bite. We Muskie hunters always have plenty of different glide baits in our boxes. Try different retrieves starting with fast and then move down to slower. Good luck.
