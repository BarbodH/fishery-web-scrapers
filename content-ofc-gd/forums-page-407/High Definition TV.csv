696553,Raf,2012-05-15 18:02:00,3495," If I didn't have a wife that needs to watch toddlers & tiaras, I'd have kissed cable/satellite goodbye and gone OTA a long time ago.  As it is though, there'd be a bounty placed on my head / WWIII would erupt.  The specialty channels are no big deal to me -- couldn't care less about swamp people or recving hockey feeds from across the country.."
696595,Beans,2012-05-15 20:19:00,3339,WOW ! Sure is a lot of input as food for thought...Many thanks Mates...  Gonna have to see HD in action before we make up our minds...
696604,Dusky,2012-05-15 20:53:00,310,"In Markham I am getting around 15 channels on OTA, around six/seven of them are HD. Total set-up cost me less then $70 as I did it myself and now no monthly bill. I second the suggestion to add OTA with your existing service."
696621,dave524,2012-05-15 21:31:00,4508,"Bought the HD receiver for Expess-Vue at Futureshop with no contract a few years ago, it was just a receiver but you could add an external Hard Drive to it and make it a PVR. Pretty sure it was just 10 dollars a month to add the HD channels to my existing package. Had an old 200 gig external kicking around , works good. Must be some hd receivers/cable boxes on Kijiji/ebay."
696628,Freshtrax,2012-05-15 21:46:00,2215, Haha no worries I don't make the rules.   I figured take the year free box rental then make decision from there.    I get a bill too ya know. ( although it's 50% off  ).      OP. if you have any questions you can send me an email at [emailÂ protected] with your needs and I will see if we have a solution for you.   (hope this is allowed)
696630,irishfield,2012-05-15 21:50:00,26272," But I do that all the time Phil !!!  As for HD.. I have an HD1080 Panasonic Tau 40"" flat tube TV. Personally I see no difference between the Xpressview HD channels and watching the same thing on the normal 200 series channel."

Somethings up with your TV or setup/installation or maybe you need to go through the menues on your TV or receiver again. Got ExpressVue too and a mid quality LG TV."
696642,irishfield,2012-05-15 22:16:00,26272, I'll take the $3000 tube over the cheap stuff anyday...nothing wrong with my eyes.. and people wonder why they're broke!!
696643,Roy,2012-05-15 22:17:00,13728,Or maybe he's just not interested in sitting in front of a TV. There are so many other things to do.
696646,irishfield,2012-05-15 22:22:00,26272,"There's that too Roy! I'd say I average about 10 minutes a day,, tops. When I get to the lake with one good channel being 66 CBC and maybe 5 MCTV (but only if the wind and moon aligns correctly) I'll be happy with a show or two a night.  Norm... there's an HD show every night on the deck!"
696651,Billy Bob,2012-05-15 22:42:00,5865,"I all honesty I did NOT read every post........but I do a ""little"" about HDTV......make sure you get at LEAST a 120hz refresher rate if you into sports........the cheaper TV's are at 60hz or whatever they are called......that makes the picture FUZZY when watching fast action....like football and hockey."
696653,DRIFTER_016,2012-05-15 22:45:00,10439, Or if you're really into sports ignore the LCD/LED TV's and get Plasma!!!!!     :tease:
696686,Canuck2fan,2012-05-16 00:27:00,1444,"Go digital at least as mentioned...  If you want to go with an HD receiver there are deals from EVERY provider who will let you have the receiver rental free for six months to a year available most of the time so pick when you sign up. After the trial period it is very easy to continue to get similar savings from whoever your provider is. I have personally had no problem getting bills reduced from 200.00 for top tv/phone/internet packages per month to 130.00 taxes included just by calling and asking what specials are offered to keep me as a customer? It is such a scam that you have to ask, suggest you will move to another provider if nothing cheaper is available but 70 bucks a month savings for a 15 minute phone call once a year is time well spent to me.  The www.redflagdeals.com forums ongoingdeals section will have all the info on all the providers and what they are offering currently. Some of these deals are even ""secret"" from contract sellers who can give a better price for new customers than you can get from calling directly (especially true for Shaw direct!!!)"
696704,SirCranksalot,2012-05-16 00:55:00,3291,"I know this is a minority opinion here, but most of the 'stuff' on our TV is hard enough to watch on regular TV.

696761,Billy Bob,2012-05-16 09:42:00,5865, There is really no such thing as a HD antenna.....HD is just simply UHF frequency.....any antenna works fine....just don't use a UHF-VHF combinder....instead use a splitter if you want more then one antenna hooked up and pointing in different directions.....I have one UHF and one VHF antenna hooked together by a splitter with each antenna pointing in almost completely different directions.....this way I get all my HD channels FREE.

697646,Raf,2012-05-18 18:47:00,3495, I have a hard time justifying the extra channels and I'm working with a decent income.  Wife just calls me cheap.  I'd have a talk with someone in Bobcaygeon and see just how many OTA channels you'd be able to pickup.  You'd get peterboro easily but I am not sure if you'd get the feeds from the CN Tower reliably or Ottawa if you pointed in that direction.
697670,Billy Bob,2012-05-18 21:57:00,5865, SIR: you are NOT cheap.....frugal is the word I use....
696444,Beans,2012-05-15 11:45:00,3339,We got a 40 inch LCD 1080P HD TV for Mother's Day and my cable company wants $250 for a set-up box or $15/mo. rental and $32/mo for the basic HD package (250 channels) or $44/mo for 300 channels...  Is having high definition worth the extra cost...we don't use all the channels we get now...(70) ?  Can we purchase the set-up box elsewhere and cheaper ?

696449,doubleheader,2012-05-15 11:59:00,497,"Beans, do yourself a favor and investigate Dish or DirectTV, personally I like Dish, but to each his own. Usually with a 1 year contract installation is free (around our area anyhow). The thing about HD is it spoils you. Sports are amazing on HD, and after trying it you won't want to watch a good movie on anything but HD. Value is in the eye of the beholder, but to me it's definitely worth it. We don't have all the movie channels like HBO, but we have the next package down, and for us we spend less than we spent on cable for a vastly superior product."
696452,lew,2012-05-15 12:00:00,12766,We've got 5 of them Norm and their fantastic.  I don't watch too much of the regular programming but for anything with alot of scenery or outdoors type of things they really are worth the extra $$$$
696454,mike rousseau,2012-05-15 12:12:00,4661,I'm wondering the same... I just got a 51 inch 1080 plasma smart tv...but still have regular cable... It sounds like a lot more money per month for hd box and programming....
696455,Fish4Eyes,2012-05-15 12:12:00,1022,"Every provider charges for the HD receiver so you certainly can't avoid that. Is the above mentioned price for a PVR receiver? Judging by the price, I would say no as they are even more money. Don't be afraid to haggle with them on the price of receivers, especially if you have been a customer for a while. I got a 200$ receiver for 50$.  Give Shaw Direct satellite a ring, I have a decent package for 55$/month. If you have a cottage or trailer, you can also set up a dish there for no extra charge other than the additional hardware required. Up to 5 or 6 receivers allowed."
696458,bubbles,2012-05-15 12:24:00,591,"Just for the record, Cable can only provide an image in 720 definition, not 1080.  They do not have the infrastucture in place to broadcast in 1080.  If you are shopping there is no sense paying the extra for 1080 over 720."
696459,Harrison,2012-05-15 12:25:00,2202,HD for sure.  Powering a TV like that with basic cable is like runing a 9.9 on a 20ft lund.
696460,Joey,2012-05-15 12:30:00,9122,"Instead of renting per month, go buy an HD box at Costco.  Will be about $500 but you won't need to rent each month, then get a package and bargain, bargain, bargain with your cable company.  they usually will give tons of discounts of you tell them you might just consider another company if their prices are too high."
696462,Oryx,2012-05-15 12:39:00,186,"I'll preface this by being a home theatre junkie....on a budget.  Cable will depend on the providor.  They will send the signal in either 720p or 1080i. P = Progressive, meaning that ALL lines of the signal will be displayed on the screen at once. I = Interlaced, meaning that the information is being broadcast as 2 images, but flickering so fast it looks like a solid pic. For a 1080P television, the pixels are 1920 x 1080.  Just like a fishfinder, Go with the best resolution you can get.  your TV's software will 'enhance' the pic.  If you have a Bluray player, get a 1080P.  The pic on these is amazing.  Try the BBC Earth series.  Also, do not forget the HDMI cables.(monoprice.com) least expensive place by far, and good quality."
696467,Pikeslayer,2012-05-15 12:53:00,1443,"My 'somewhat expert' general opinion:  You will want at minimum a 'digital' cable box/package (I think these are now standard?). Quality of digital channels on your HD LCD will vary according to the source/channel. Some are noticably better than others. With lower quality digitial channels, you may see small vertical red/green lines intemittingly during some parts of the program (they come and go based on signal strength/interference). Your 40"" has the same number of pixels as a 60"" (on mid range HD tv's). So the good news is that a 40"" tv will definitely give you a better digital picture than a bigger tv. Lower quality digital channels will look a lot more grainy on larger tv's. Like Lew, I also have 5 HD tv's in the house/garage. Ranging from 26"" to 52"". I only run HD converters on 2 of them (46 & 52). The 42 in my man cave is on a digital box and this is where I watch most. I have no complaints about the picture quality when watching my favourite programming (A&E, NatGeo, History etc). Some 'secondary sports' channels (TSN 2, sportsnet) are not great for watching on digital, but CBC is okay.  My advice based on your tv size, would be to start with the digital package. You will never 'miss' HD programming if you never had it to start with (but you will have visitors who tell you how much better HD is). Also, the further the tv is from your sofa/lazy boy will also improve your viewing. Ideally, you would want at least 6 ft between you and your tv. At any time, you could upgrade to HD but HD packages are significantly way more expensive than digital.  That's my nickel,  Simon"
696468,danbouck,2012-05-15 12:57:00,4380,"Personally I wouldn't pay that amount for HD. I have HD and it's great but I only pay $10/month extra  I had no HD for years on my 50"" and it worked just fine"
696474,gino,2012-05-15 13:15:00,400,"best thing is to buy any used HD box from Kijiji...whatever it is Dish, Bell, Rogers...whatever is cheaper in the area you live for programs."

696537,smally21,2012-05-15 16:51:00,993,"upgrading my digital package to HD was something like 8$ a month. buy a couple of kijiji receivers (check the serial's with provider beofre buying) and you are off. or the 'pace' unit at future shop for 150$.  great increase in picture quality. dont know where the hundreds of dollars a year is coming from. its not that much.  what is a better use of money, buying HD tvs and not using them to their potential or paying a little extra for HD?  if a better image is worth it, spend it. its no one else's business how you 'operate'."
696546,Raf,2012-05-15 17:24:00,3495," Just to be clear Norm, you will not get 250 or 300 HD Channels.  I'm speculating a little but the package pricing they gave you is likely for a digital package which includes a mix of SD / HD channels.  The actual number of HD channels is less (depends on the provider).  If you are already getting a digital package and wish to add HD content, it's typically $8-20 extra.  Shaw Direct (satellite) is actually one of the worst providers in terms of quantity of HD channels -- though that's supposed to improve this fall when they launch their new bird into space.  Where they excel IMO is in customer service.  Their support staff is knowledgeable and prompt.  I suspect Rogers, Cogeco (cable), Shaw Cable and Bell (satellite) are the best in terms of quantity.  Also remember that there are other sources for FREE HD content (ie. Over the Air antenna) that the telcos don't want you to know about.  Yes.. a form of rabbit ears that receives a digital HD signal.  There are many options and I'd advise you to look at your viewing habits.. if you watch specialty channels (I suspect you don't since you currently have a basic cable package), an OTA antennae will not work for you. If however, you're mostly interested in picking up local (southern ontario, WNY) HD feeds, OTA may be the ticket. Did I mention free?  You may find that keeping your existing cable plan and supplementing it with a OTA HD antenna will be enough or, you may ditch cable altogether and be fine with OTA."
