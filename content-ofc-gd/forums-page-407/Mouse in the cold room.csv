We had a family of mice move in and nest in the cab filter compartment of our combine one winter and by the time we discovered it late that summer when servicing it for harvest, it was a stinking mess. The chewed up a $100 cab filter an pissed and crapped every where. We cleaned it up the best we could and replaced the filter, but that cab stunk of mouse piss until the day we traded it off. I got stuck running that combine all harvest and hence developed a real hatred for all types of rodents. I say. kill em all."

After all they are just looking for warmth and food like most animals. No need to kill everything we humans touch is there? I put a small piece of stale bread or cracker in them with some peanut butter or soft cheese smeared into it. Set the live trap with the opening pushed up against the wall and in line with it. Mice like to follow along walls and will be enticed by the dark hole of the trap and smell of something good inside. Check it twice a day or more. After a successful capture and release, wash everything with mild dish soap and a few drops of bleach and wash your hands a couple times after handling them, the traps and bait and after cleaning their droppings. Of course you need to find where they are getting in and block it. Ours got in the dryer vent screen(chewed through the plastic grate) and then through the plastic discharge tube. I replaced the plastic dryer vent hood with a metal one that closed properly and also replaced the flimsy plastic tube with a thick aluminum one. No more mice."

696493,Headhunter,2012-05-15 14:11:00,5703,"Emil, try this... As I know you have kids, you probably have some of those fruit roll ups that kids like as a snack. Take a piece of the roll up and roll it in your fingers until it gets soft. Jam it onto the business end of the trap and set the trap. Mice love this stuff and it will harden soon after the heat of your fingers is gone. They will actually tug on the fruit rollup to get it off the trap. It also emits a pungent fruit odor that they can't resist... and it can be used over and over as the little buggers can't get it off the trap. HH"

696549,DanD,2012-05-15 17:31:00,2223,If the mice are clearing the bait without tripping the trap; go get some of those sheets or tray sticky traps. If a mouse even slightly touches the sticky surface it won’t be going anywhere. A couple of things I don’t like about the sticky traps are; they don’t kill the mouse you usually have the honor of doing that. Or when you find a mouse stuck to it they’ll have chewed through one of their appendages trying to get away; not the most humane thing; but these traps work when you have mice that have figured out the spring traps.

696622,Big Cliff,2012-05-15 21:36:00,6899,"I've tried all sorts of mouse traps and the old style cheep wooden work the best. Make sure you get the peanut butter inside the little loop on the trigger so it has to work to get it all out, place them along a wall as suggested. You will get them (yes, there is likely more than one). Once you are sure there are no more mice in there, spray the whole area with a mixture of bleach and water (10:1 ratio seems to work well) to disinfect it.  Give everything a really good cleaning and disinfect again. Then always leave a trap set for the future just in case they ever find their way back again. Mice leave a scent trail that others can follow."

The mice have found a way in and the only way to stop them from using it is to plug the leak. If you find a small hole or gap between the rim joist and foundation plug it with some steel wool (available at the hardware store), this will keep them from coming in."

Place the mousetrap with the peanut butter side towards the wall.  If you set it in the middle of the room, there's a chance the mouse will come in from the wrong side, trip the flipper and end up getting tossed in the air and escape.  I've seen it in action, funny as hell."
696352,kickingfrog,2012-05-15 00:57:00,8333, It's only funny if yer not the mouse.  Definitely put them perpendicular and right against the walls.
696362,35Wailin,2012-05-15 01:48:00,59,"  Spend a few more dollars and get this trap, CTC 59-1924-8.  It has a larger trigger pan, and more likely to trap it.  Use peanut butter as advised and place it along the walls do that the pan is facing the wall.  That way when they run along the wall as they are wont to do, they will trigger the trap, even if they weren't after the bait.  I use this trap all the time and they can be set to be rather sensitive.  I very rarely have an escapee.  Sometimes though, they are not killed immediately and can/will drag the trap into a hidey hole while they expire.  You will find out in a few days that they have expired by the smell.  I usually attach the trap with a piece of wire to a heavy object if possible.  Even a 12"" stick tied in the middle to the wire would work.  Good luck."
