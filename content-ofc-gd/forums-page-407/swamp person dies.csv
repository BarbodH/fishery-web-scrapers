696375,chessy,2012-05-15 02:12:00,610,"""Swamp People"" star Mitchell Guist died on the bayou.     Guist, the grizzled and bearded costar of the History reality series about Cajun alligator hunters, died Monday after suffering a fall while loading items into his boat in Assumption Parish, Louisiana, according to the network and news reports. He was four days short of his 48th birthday.     He appeared on ""Swamp People"" with his brother Glenn; the two resembled each other so strongly that many people mistook them for twins.     In a statement, History wrote in part: ""Mitchell passed on the swamp, doing what he loved.""     ""Swamp People"" has become an important part of History's swing toward docu-reality series about people doing tough jobs whose inner workings are seldom seen by outsiders. The Season 2 finale last year drew a record 5.5 million total viewers, according to Nielsen.   "
