696356,kickingfrog,2012-05-15 01:31:00,8333,Ya the picture is not the best but there is no doubt what that is.
696361,DRIFTER_016,2012-05-15 01:47:00,10439,OMG!!!! When did the sun go super nova? Did I miss something?   :rofl2:
696376,Moosebunk,2012-05-15 02:13:00,3970,"You're right, it can be a tough task.  Great job on your first this year.  You can tell it's a good solid fish."
696394,hammercarp,2012-05-15 02:44:00,964,I still think it's a cool pic.
696399,mercman,2012-05-15 02:54:00,7054,Man thats on ugly ass monster !!! Must be a blast to catch though.
696472,Rod Caster,2012-05-15 13:09:00,5784,Very cool pic. Looks huge!
696501,Headhunter,2012-05-15 14:31:00,5703,"Nice big Gar! I've only caught them in the 2-3 ft range... care to comment on their fighting ability? Interested to know if the bigger one's put up more of a tussle then the small one's I've caught. Thanks, HH"
696623,FisherJuli,2012-05-15 21:36:00,125,"Cool pic, neat fish!!"
696636,SirCranksalot,2012-05-15 22:02:00,3291,"Now, be gar, that's quite the fish. It isn't the ass that's ugly, its the snout! I've only seen one alive and have never caught one. I wouldn't want to have 1 charge me in my canoe. How big was it? How big do they get?"
696675,Trevor0179,2012-05-15 23:28:00,65,"Here's a little snap shot of what it says on wikipedia about the longnose gar  The longnose gar ranges in length from 60–182 cm (24–72 in) and weighs 0.5–3.5 kg (1.1–7.7 lb); The world record is 50.31 pounds, caught in Trinity River, Texas in 1954; FishBase reports a maximum size of 2 m (6.6 ft). Average life span is 17- 20 years.  Tight lines Trevor"
696703,esoxansteel,2012-05-16 00:54:00,1307,"Nice fish Larry, a thing of pre-historic beauty,"
696710,spincast,2012-05-16 01:12:00,3279,"v cool fish, congrats. Still gotta get me one of them"
696716,Snidley,2012-05-16 01:35:00,620,"Our Gars are actually quite attractive fish. Alligator Gars like found in the Trinity, not so much."
696750,Mike the Pike,2012-05-16 03:52:00,3421,Thanks for the pic Larry.  Now if I only had as much time as you.
696946,Garfisher,2012-05-16 21:17:00,229,"How big is that? (I'm thinking high 40's-50"" long). Nicely done on the giant"
696958,jigsnreels,2012-05-16 22:04:00,133," I think the pic looks pretty cool.  Nice fish. Never caught one myself, but I've seen a couple of people pull them out of the forks of the Thames in London..."
697073,marine5068,2012-05-17 02:19:00,26,"Nice one. We have HUGE Gars here in the rivers near me and on Moira Lake. I saw one swirl at my Muskie bait once that was at least 50"" long. I only saw the back section and thought that it was a giant Northern Pike at first. I know all the spots where they breed nearby and you can see a hundred of them a day staking out their own open spots in weeds there. Pretty neat looking fish. Look a bit like dinosaurs to me."
697129,hoby5,2012-05-17 03:36:00,42,Better pic than i could manage trying to hold a big gar and taking the crap well done!
697181,Lungelarry,2012-05-17 12:27:00,294,"Thanks alot guys, this fish was 48in. and right now they don,t fight that good a few good runs and thats it. I think they are the best looking fish out there."
697204,RJackson,2012-05-17 13:07:00,113,"Nice fish Larry!  Get yourself a tripod, though I do like that shot.  This past week has been the best stretch of weather for it I've seen.  Oh and I happen to have been on holidays for it!  RJ"
