697005,Ron,2012-05-16 23:51:00,1683,"I had problems with one of my HDS5 finders, took the drive to Lowrance, discovered they moved to a new location. I finally get to their new office. I forgot my receipt so I was going to have to drive an hour and a half back to Cobourg. I told him to hang onto the unit and I will fax the receipt to him. They take down all my info, including cell phone number. I am not 3 minutes away from their parking lot and the phone rings, ""Hello sir, I contacted head office with the serial number and determined yes in fact it is still under warrenty, your new unit is ready for pick up at the front desk"".   SWEET!!!! Now that is customer service.  And people wonder why I stick to certain makes and brands.   Cheers, Ron..."
