694553,Mike Pike,2012-05-09 14:49:00,1332,"Hey Wantabigone, I'm wondering if you've tried using the famous 'hair rig' for carp.  It's a staple for many situations.  Look it up on-line.  It's pretty simple to tie and might help you with your hook up percentage."
694872,Beans,2012-05-10 15:03:00,3339," A straightened out jig makes an ok baiting needle to put the bait on the ""hair"" and a bit of a blade of grass can be a ""stopper""...   "
694873,Beans,2012-05-10 15:05:00,3339, Amen Lew !!!   
696542,wantabigone,2012-05-15 17:03:00,97,"I tried the hair rig with little success. I am guessing my bait was not being held securely below the hook. After my 3 boys with me caught 5 fish I switched over to my treble hook. Now that I have thought more about my experience I have a new idea to attach the bait below the single hook. I am thinking of tieing a small amount of styrofoam below the hook and to use that to anchor and float the bait off the ground. I may try this on the weekend. My boys are already asking when we can go again. Now to decide do we go back to the place in London for the numbers or do we try other areas for bigger carp? decisions decisions.  Oh, I need to find out where to buy real grits (not cornmeal)"
696912,Warthaug,2012-05-16 19:17:00,30," Sounds awesome - SWMBO'd and I were hoping to do a bit of fishing on Monday (the holiday) in London.  We're new (to London), so we're not 100% what to try.  I don't suppose you' care to share what you use to catch carp?  I've never tried before, and have no clue as how to do it...I was planning on just dragging some spinners through the water, but considering pickerel are off-season (and apparently in the Thames - I never would have expected that), I'm thinking that may not be such a good idea...  Bryan"
696917,wildeye rainbow,2012-05-16 19:28:00,123,"Hey Warthaug,  the pickeral and pike season opens up again on the London Thames on the second Saturday in May - that was last Saturday.  There are resident walleye and pike throughout this part of the Thames.  There should be silver bass coming up the Thames soon - you can nail them with silver Mepps.  WR"
696990,Warthaug,2012-05-16 22:56:00,30,"Oops, mis-read the regs; its bass that are still off-limits.  I've got a few mepps-style spinners in my kit; we'll definitely give them a go.  I'd still like to try carp though; sounds like they're a good fight..  Bryan"
697250,jigsnreels,2012-05-17 15:17:00,133, A bit of bread on a hook works fine for me.  Throw on a split shot for weight and a bobber and you're good to go.
697258,Warthaug,2012-05-17 15:49:00,30,"That sounds easy - I'll give it a go.  I've been reading some older posts here and it sounds like a lot of people throw some corn onto the water around their line - corn + bread...if I don't catch fish, at least I'l have lunch!  Bryan"
697283,Dontcryformejanhrdina,2012-05-17 17:10:00,535,"I saw lots of carp swimming around while fishing mon and yesterday, very spooky fish, would like to give them a try eventually for the fight.    I was throwing a husky jerk for pike, and I caught a few pike (and a tiny tiger musky), a walleye, and quite a few bass, both LM and SM. I caught more bass than pike because, well, there's more of them. Does that mean I can't be throwing baits shallow among rocks/weeds because I could very likely catch a bass too?   Before monday I caught all of my pike on a musky rod. I fished zone 17 for pike earlier this year while bass, musky and walleye were closed, so I used small musky baits that have done well for me in the past for pike, not wanting to catch walleye or bass plus I have confidence in catching pike on musky gear. I had 2 pike follow but caught a musky instead, so I stopped using musky gear until June, especially since the lake I just fished in has a large population of musky. But now using smaller ""bass"" lures, I caught many bass and even a tiger musky, in the same areas I caught pike and walleye. Damned if you do, damned if you don't, I guess."
697346,wantabigone,2012-05-17 20:33:00,97,waurthog- I sent you a PM.
697435,Warthaug,2012-05-17 23:57:00,30,"This is one part of the regs I've never been clear on - I know you're not allowed to target out-of-season fish, but quite often methods for targeting one species of fish are identical to that for another (i.e. bass & pike).  Assuming one species is in season, would MNR still nail me for ""targeting"" the off-season species?  Hell, up at the in-laws cottage you'll catch pickerel, pike, smallies, lakers (if you're lucky) and even whitefish dragging a worm through the same damned channel...  Bryan  PS: thanx everyone who PM'd me about the carp.  I'm super-excited now!"
697588,Beans,2012-05-18 15:30:00,3339,"  If you think you are excited now, just wait until you hook-up with 20 lbs of angry carp on the end of your line !!!  I still shake like a leaf afterwards...  One of the reasons I usually have half a dozen hair rigs tied in advance in case I break the hair during the unhooking procedure...  "
697609,jigsnreels,2012-05-18 16:20:00,133," I haven't spoken to many MNR officers (never even seen one in the London area, although I have heard of them doing checks up at Fanshawe occasionally), but the few I have chatted with seemed pretty reasonable - and also very knowledgable about their ""beats.""  I'm sure they'll have a pretty good idea about what you're going for just by the location you're fishing in and the setup you're using.  For example, if you're fishing Pond Mills for ""crappie"" and you just happen to pull out a fat bucketmouth on a 7"" plastic worm, you might get a talking-to..."
693932,wantabigone,2012-05-07 19:19:00,97,"Finally wet a line this warm season with my 2 boys. We fished for carp in London and had a blast. We caught dozens in the 5-12 pound range. My youngest son (age 7) and I stayed upriver and caught 5 but lost at least 12 due to poor hookups. We had many hits only to see them steal my bait which was evident by the bare hook when I reeled in.  My oldest boy(17) was more adventurous strolling downstream and catching dozens of carp in the various small pools.  Weather was perfect and the boys were excited. PERFECT day with my boys.  I have a new idea on baiting my hook and am looking forward to trying it out in a few weeks to see if I can get a better hook up percentage.  The only thing I regret is that my oldest said he saw 2 walleye on a stringer and he was going to release them when he was confronted by an ""older"" guy yelling at him to leave them alone. As they were not in season in the area they never should have been on the stringer. Unfortunately he did not say anything to me until we were half an hour away heading home. I would have gladly released the fish!"
693988,Victor,2012-05-07 21:34:00,1609,"Sounds like a great day minus the walleye on a stringer.  They may be coarse fish to some people but hey, they put up a heck of a fight!"
693991,misfish,2012-05-07 21:42:00,29133,"Im trying to figure out where I can fish carp around here. I know theres some in the Barrie marina,but it,s a P3TA dealing with the robcops.  May need to make plans to visit my ole friend Beans."
694327,wantabigone,2012-05-08 19:07:00,97,  They sure do put up a good fight! Now I need to find where the big ones are hanging out.
694329,davey buoy,2012-05-08 19:13:00,5505,"I know a southern part of Simcoe that is full of them,boat access only."
694336,hammercarp,2012-05-08 19:44:00,964,"What a great day you had. Too bad about the walleye. I had the same experience where I was fishing carp. This boat came along. They were obviously fishing for bass as they covered the shore throwing spinnerbaits. As they motored over my line one idiot looked at me and said "" Carp"" in an all knowing kind of way. I replied ""Yup"" and then said "" I would probably be fishing for bass but the season doesn't open for another six or seven weeks."" A few seconds later the idiot replied "" Ya right "" . They then sped off to go poach some where else.   Anybody know these two?"
694338,Christopheraaron,2012-05-08 19:48:00,3525, Just hope they aren't on this board.
694339,Raf,2012-05-08 19:49:00,3495,"  So get this..  given that pike season opened on the great lakes this past wknd, we were fishing pike this wknd in hammy harbour and this idiot carp fishing on shore accuses us of bass fishing."
694341,davey buoy,2012-05-08 19:53:00,5505," Ohhhhhh!,spinner baits ,awesome for pike,again people are far to quick to judge again..Think before you type !,everyone. Just sayin."
694371,Rod Caster,2012-05-08 21:35:00,5784," Sounds like a GREAT family outing!  Brian, robocops stopped me a few times down there looking for carp a couple years ago. I was not sure if the marina actually had them or not; I fished with corn and apparently rock bass have a natural aggressive tendancy towards bits of corn."
694386,Beans,2012-05-08 23:15:00,3339," Brian...There are tons of carp in Simcoe but like the pickerel...Where are they ???  A couple of guys harvest them for some restaurants in New York city...they catch them by nets in Cookes Bay  I'd love to have you out for carp...it is still a bit early but we are getting the odd one (or two, like yesterday)...I have two complete outfits...bait running reels, long carp rods bank stix and two alarms...Had Meely and his girl out last year with me and my  missus...his girlfriend landed a twenty pounder like a pro but she had been practising on three shoal carp (musky) over the weekend before...Maribeth knew what happened to CPH's wife (bad bruise) so Meely gave me the rod to land the second one...We then had two hook pull-outs then left to do a bit of sight seeing...If the action is slow it can get quite boring but one big boy/girl makes up for it..."
694441,hammercarp,2012-05-09 01:51:00,964, Fishing for pike in less that 3 ft of water with a rocky bottom . Huggiing the shore . Ya sure. Those guys were targeting OOS smallies. Plain as the nose on your face.
694453,mike rousseau,2012-05-09 02:25:00,4661, Actually a lot of fish are mixed together right now due to some common attractants....  Good food....warm water...spawning habitat...  I have a spot right now where the next hit I get could be a smallie...largie...walleye...pike...with pretty equal odds...As well as a few other species ive caught there...  Well that's here anyways...
694455,irishfield,2012-05-09 02:38:00,26272, Guess you don't pike fish much... Them rocks get warmed by the sun and well Pike like to suntan in the spring! If you can't fish for pike with a spinner bait.. what should we use to appease?
694457,hammercarp,2012-05-09 02:42:00,964,"Come on. I could imagine the conversation when these guys set out"" I'll show you a spot where I've some monster smallies fishing for pike."" When they left they headed across the bay to fish off of Eastport Dr. That is pike habitat. Big weed beds with drop offs into deep water."
694458,irishfield,2012-05-09 02:43:00,26272,I think that's the problem... you're imagining! Don't judge what folks are fishing for based on their boat design.
694459,hammercarp,2012-05-09 02:45:00,964,I have fished for pike before. I can tell you the area they were fishing is loaded with pre spawn small mouth. I know guys that that target pike in the harbour and they weren't fishing that kind of water on the  weekend.
694463,hammercarp,2012-05-09 02:54:00,964,Sorry but I was not doing that I was judging based on what they were throwing and where they were throwing it.
694466,irishfield,2012-05-09 02:56:00,26272,Spinner baits? Maybe they were poaching Muskie...
694470,hammercarp,2012-05-09 03:00:00,964,If they were fishing pike why did they leave after I confronted them? I didn't say anything more. They could have just kept doing what they were doing or even corrected my mistake. They knew I had one picture of them and knew I would take more if they pulled in more bass.
694472,hammercarp,2012-05-09 03:05:00,964,I apologize to wantobegone for taking this too far. I'll keep my fingers off the keyboard on this one.
694473,irishfield,2012-05-09 03:05:00,26272, So which is it   Obviously fishing for.. or actually catching them.. the story has now changed!
694526,Raf,2012-05-09 13:17:00,3495,P.S.  We left before the ensuing boilie salvo from this lunatic could begin.
694535,lew,2012-05-09 13:34:00,12766,And another fishing report gets ruined.  So sad.
694550,chuckymcd,2012-05-09 14:40:00,144,oh my    Sounds like a good outing! glad you had fun.
