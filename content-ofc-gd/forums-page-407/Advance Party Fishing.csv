Same as last fall, the water level is way down, shutting us off from several spring hot spots.  We're not able to fish any moving water or most river mouths.  Fish haven't left the lake, but they're hanging in different places.  Tuesday we had 18 mph wind with gusts to 25 mph.  We hit the shore line at the mouth of Bull Whip Creek.  Wraparound waves pounded the shore and a north wind moved our boat parallel to the shore, pretty quickly.  Our boat stayed in less than 2 fow and we threw 1 1/8 oz JSM, tipped with a red, 5 1/2"" Uncle Josh pork rind.  We boated dozens of 35"" - 41"" pike, stinging most in about a foot of water.  No huge fish, but the ones we caught were really heavy and great fighters.  There was enough oxygen in the water to pump them up for battle.  The spot was good to us for drift after drift after drift.  We're finding good pike by fishing in shallow bays, although I had expected to find them on the corners and humps by now. Pike are making long, strong runs and doing their best to stretch our line.  We'll be having walleyes for lunch Saturday.  Whopper is on the road somewhere, bringing along his homemade pasta sauce for our Wednesday meal."
