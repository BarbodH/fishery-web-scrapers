697224,sleded,2012-05-17 14:01:00,96,hey guys i just got a good deal on a long shaft and i need to raise the transom up. My transom is 16 inches how many inches do i need to raise it?? If anyone has any ideas let me know thanks
697227,jedimaster,2012-05-17 14:25:00,3472,"20inches, if the transom has a dip like a U shape to it then just build it straight across. If not I can't see a super good way to rais it without having your motor end up in the lake without using a jack plate."
697228,fishindevil,2012-05-17 14:25:00,6254,"transoms are usually 15 or 20 inches,so your longshaft engine is probly fit for a 20 inch transom,i have seen some guys bolt a plate on the outside of the back transom and up and square it off back down to the inside of the transome so i guess you would have to lift if 5 inches or so up i have seen it a few times so it is do-able,but i think you would have to make sure its very strong as it would be disater if it was not done right and your motor would be gone,or worse split the back of the transome and sink ???"

697245,jedimaster,2012-05-17 14:58:00,3472,One of these more specifically works well as long as your transom is currntly rock solid. It will place extra stress on your transom.  http://www.thmarine.com/products/Outboard-Jack-Plates/Static-Height-Plates/CMC-Static-Jack-Plate-5-inch-vertical-extension
697269,NAW,2012-05-17 16:22:00,4022,What Jedi Said.  I have a buddy who did the exact same thing.  He bought a commercially available jack plate.  No complaints.
