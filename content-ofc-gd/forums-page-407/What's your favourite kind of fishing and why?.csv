I used to do all the other stuff but 10 minutes of standing and casting and my back starts saying ""OUCH""...Now I can still go out in the boat and troll and drift or anchor and still fish...  I like the idea of carp fishing because once you get all set-up and casted out you just sit back and wait on a comfortable chair...we tend to repack our feeders with ground bait every half hour then it is back to waiting some more and telling each other tall tales...  I love to hear my alarm go off...my ears are not as good as Steve's ...I never hear his baitrunner  Ice-fishing doesn't have much appeal for me anymore...   "

695113,Gregoire,2012-05-11 01:37:00,1397,"My favorite fish to target is musky, and love the violence of the strike. The few times I have seen them take to the air was exilerating and when you are trolling for them rod in hand, as I prefer to do in one lake that has a large amount of vegetation, the strike jars you. You feel it throughout your entire body, and the strongest one wins. A hungry musky commits hits a bait so hard, and you have to counter that strike with your own strength. I guess I love it because it takes me back to my football days, and the thrill of delivering a big hit, without the pain and aches after a game. I can still feel some of the violent strikes in my bones, just like I still feel some of my hardest hits. I also love how hard a salmon fights, taking 20+ minutes to land a fish and feeling the burn in your arms from the runs. And just when you think the fish is spent, it peels off 100ft of line. If I had to choose it would be musky, but Luckily I don't Oh yeah...if I couldn't fish for musky or salmon I would be perfectly happy with topwater bass action, and could live with shore fishing for pike. Luckily I don't need to choose."

Takes a bit of time but hugely rewarding when the line starts peeling off the bail.  The one in my avatar was actually taken in Ketchikan, Alaska on a blue and white 1/4 oz. Buzz Bomb, and took me a good half hour to land...  Pinks are a lot of fun too, they're easily the most aggressive of the Pacific species.  Throw a simple little pink or yellow feather jig in front of them and you can spend a whole afternoon getting strike after strike after strike.  As far as Ontario goes, though, I've really enjoyed just fishing for bass and panfish.  There's a few places around London that are easily accessible and give pretty good sport.  I really do want to get after some lake salmon/steelhead sometime...  "

Others like to troll because it's a nice slow cruise around the lake WHILE catching fish, bass fishing is appealing because of the almost constant action at times. What is your go to technique/species that you target, and why do you like it more than anything else?  Casting for musky is what I love most. I like moving around and throwing baits more than jigging/trolling. I guess it's a combination of the chase, the difficulty in finding the fish and the sudden strike that can come out of nowhere after hours of nothing. Plus I'm not a patient person so being able to overpower a fish with a tight drag and get it in the net as quickly as possible appeals to me."

694889,mike rousseau,2012-05-10 16:13:00,4661,Structure trolling walleye...  Walleye on structure are very aggressive and hit hard... And it's a run and gun style of fishing.... Lots of small spots...as fast as you can... Till you hit a fish... Then work em...  Also this is rod in hand trolling... So you feel the hit... And whoever adds the better action to their bait WILL catch more fish...holding your rod still all day won't get you many fish... You gotta add twitches and sweeps and drop backs... Oh yeah... And drop back strikes.... Sometimes the walleye just bump a bait... But if you let out 5-10 feet right after the bump... Engage you reel...then give it a twitch... More often then not you'll get slammed!!!   Love it...

My girls out grew going to the cottage we rented and my wife really isn't into fishing. I never used the boat for fishing near my home in London. I'm back to shore fishing now and spend most of my fishing time pursuing steelhead. I love the simplicity and the complexity of fishing for steelhead. I love walking the rivers in search of them , then trying to find the bait that they will hit. Some days it seems simple while at other times it is a complex process to find what they are interested in. Since I fish alone most of the time I can go river fishing with little preparation needed and can return when I want if nothing is happening."

That split second of anticipation while you are reacting to set the hook before you even know what is on the end of your line...that's what it's all about for me.

694924,manitoubass2,2012-05-10 17:04:00,11391," Right before spawn in the evenings, when they chase shiners to the shoreline.  Again in fall when the shiner run begins again, same scenario.  This is on a river system though where the walleye/baitfish migrate into LOTW for the summer. I'm not sure if it happens on other lakes or not?  They hit top water frogs and x-rap popper style baits in 3FOW to 6"" of water. It's super fun because it's not ""typical"" walleye behaviour, or most would say/think that.  But they would be wrong, lol"
