697103,SirCranksalot,2012-05-17 02:50:00,3291,Are you sure that's not an OOS walleye??
697106,Nipfisher,2012-05-17 02:51:00,2449,9 or 10 walleye?
697110,Pipefighter,2012-05-17 02:56:00,29,  No trip was last September just posting it now
697112,Pipefighter,2012-05-17 02:57:00,29, ??
697121,Nipfisher,2012-05-17 03:18:00,2449,"  You have 4 fingers showing and your dad (I'm guressing) has 5 fingers (actually 4 and a thumb) + you are holding a walleye.   So I was guessing that you caught 4 and he caught 5? Or you both caught 5?    Anyways, as you are just posting a test pic we were having some fun. The OOS comment was also a joke.  BTW I am a huge Giants fan. Can't strand the cry baby Habs though."
