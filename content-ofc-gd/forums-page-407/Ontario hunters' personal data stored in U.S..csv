697451,Grimace,2012-05-18 00:43:00,2020,"Some of the anti US commentary that has invaded this thread is ridiculous.  I am not going to waste any time apologizing for it.  This is not what this thread is about.  I am not a paranoid gun owner (I know the type), in fact I do not even own a gun nor do I hunt.  I do fish however and the same bunch are doing the fishing licenses. My beef is with the information sharing in general.  It doesn't sit well with me that if I purchase a hunting or fishing license in my country that a foreign country's federal anti terrorist agency could obtain it.  It is not the American company that is handling this contract that is at fault.  They would only turn over the information to Homeland Security if asked (which they certainly would be).  It is not Homeland Security's fault (I think the citizenry of the USA have lost many freedoms after the inception of this organization but that doesn't matter here), they would be just doing what they do, gathering every piece of intelligence on every little thing.  It is our MNR's fault for giving this contract out to a foreign company.  That is where my annoyance lies.  More than likely the real problem with this situation may lie not with the American company handing our information to Homeland Security but with the fact that a private company (American or Canadian) is doing it in the first place.  More than likely the info will be sold to marketing interests and that is another pet peeve of mine.  Our provincial government has been doing a fine job for years taking care of our licensing.  The only real problems that have taken place have occurred this year under the new set up.  There was no need to privatize it.  Anyways, that is my 30 cents.  I hope that I have made it clear that in no way did I start this thread so people could bash on the States."
697457,aplumma,2012-05-18 00:54:00,6896,Lets hope it will stay on track I like to see what people think on many of the issues that effects both Nations but have very little tolerance from either Nationality on loud statements with NO substance.

At the same time, if you've ""never worked"", then you can't expect very much.  But what about the millions and millions of people that can be described as the ""working poor""?  There are a lot of individuals that work as long and hard as you and can barely afford rent, let alone medical insurance.  What about people who find themselves suddenly laid off and without insurance?  For these people, a trip to the doctor...even the ER...is at best a severe financial hardship, and at worst simply out of their budget.  Whether or not your health care system is the best in the world is totally irrelevant to them, because they can't afford to access it.  So like I said, IF you can afford it..."

What could happen?  How might your life be impacted?  Also, why would Homeland Security conceivably want a list of Ontario residents that applied for a fishing license?  Even if they did, what would they do with it?  Why do I need to keep secret from ""a foreign country's federal anti terrorist agency"" the fact that I fish?  Why would H.S. care that I fish, and why would I care that they know I fish?  I don't like seeing government services privatized either...and if they are, you'd think they could find a Canadian company (with Canadian employees) to do the job...the fact that Homeland Security might compile a list of Ontario residents that fish though, is not a valid argument against it, or (that I can see) a reason to get upset, worry, or feel ""unsettled""."

697057,Grimace,2012-05-17 01:44:00,2020,"I just came across this article and found it a little unsettling.  http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/toronto/story/2012/05/16/hunters-gun-us-patriot-act.html  Ontario hunters' personal data stored in U.S. The Canadian Press Posted: May 16, 2012 6:35 PM ET Last Updated: May 16, 2012 6:34 PM ET  The personal information of Ontario residents who apply for hunting and fishing licences is being stored in the United States, where it is subject to the American Patriot Act.  A Tennessee-based company won the contract to implement an automated licensing system for Ontario for hunters and fishers, and stores the personal data it collects in the United States.  The Ontario Federation of Anglers and Hunters says its 100,000 members are ""deeply concerned"" about the potential loss of privacy inherent in having their personal data stored in the U.S. Natural Resources Minister Michael Gravelle says the firm, Active Outdoors, signed a contract with very specific terms on abiding by Ontario law to protect personal information.  However, the anglers and hunters worry Homeland Security will use the Patriot Act to access the personal data of Ontarians that is stored in the U.S.  The Progressive Conservatives say the data should be stored in Ontario, while the NDP say the issue is another reason why they flatly oppose privatization of government services."

I find it odd that a bunch of people that absolutely loathe the gun registry would now be okay with the MNR allowing an American company to document this information and turn it over to homeland security when asked.  I can see Canadians on vacation in the USA running into problems with the law because of it.  Those are the reasons for my concern.  I do not see the Kia comment as a valud comparison.  I do not think that Kia, upon sale of a car in Ontario, documents specific personal information, sends it off to head office in Korea, who then hand it over to their federal anti terrorist agency.  But hey, I could be wrong.  :-)  This can be a perfectly intelligent thread if it can endure the silly anti USA rants and the inflammatory ""Jerry Jerry"" signs from the peanut gallery."

Name & address (which they usually record when you enter anyways) and what fishing/hunting license you may have? It just doesn't seem there would be any so-called ""private information"" in the data-bank.  That being said, I do think it's ridiculous the MNR would hire a company from Tennessee to administer the whole thing.

There's no evidence to suggest that that is what happened with the personal information of Canadian firearm owners either...this is no more than a matter of some paranoid individuals suspecting it may happen.  Even if they're right...what's the difference?  I'd love for someone to explain to me how their freedom, privacy or any other aspect of their lives can be impinged upon by the mere existence of their name documented as a legal firearm owner in a foreign database.  Do naturally paranoid people tend to be gun owners...or does the act of firearm ownership make one paranoid?
