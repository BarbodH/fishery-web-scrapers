697527,Skipper D,2012-05-18 10:36:00,1970,"By the way it reads on the main section of the board , it looks like its Roy who put the fire ban in place  and i was thinking how thoughtful , but where did he get that kind of power ......... lol"
697550,jedimaster,2012-05-18 12:33:00,3472," I don't think algonquin is part of the fireban, from the links I see the fireban doesn't start until north of the park. Has anyone confirmed this to be the case, some people were saying they heard of the fireban starting at barrie."
696655,Muskieman,2012-05-15 22:50:00,2472,For all of us heading North this weekend.  http://www.mnr.gov.on.ca/en/Business/AFFM/2ColumnSubPage/240351.html  Just in time for the long weekend ... Gas prices are probably gonna spike too...  Randy
696657,irishfield,2012-05-15 22:54:00,26272,Looks like folks can still cook at least... a far cry from the previous all out ban on any fires a few years ago. Tinder dry folks.. so don't be sending smoke signals that you can't put out.
696658,Muskieman,2012-05-15 22:57:00,2472,"I'm driving into Gull (Hwy 805) on Friday , I wanna be able to come home on Monday ( not really ) , play safe gang ."
696674,Rod Caster,2012-05-15 23:28:00,5784,Thanks for posting this Randy. Our friend Matt (bassassin) will either be on high alert or dealing with fires this weekend.
696676,irishfield,2012-05-15 23:30:00,26272, Hell.. he'll probably be sitting in Orient Gardens ordering chinese!
696691,Rod Caster,2012-05-16 00:34:00,5784," ....just like Matt, you might even catch me doing that this summer."
696805,johnnyb,2012-05-16 13:19:00,3413,"  Wayne, do you mean cook with a bbq or camp stove only?  From what I'm reading that appears to be the only way...."
696807,irishfield,2012-05-16 13:28:00,26272,"This was what Randy pulled up ........... Fires in restricted fire zones  12. No person shall start a fire outdoors in a restricted fire zone,  (a) except in accordance with a permit issued under the regulations; or  b ) unless the fire is for the purpose of cooking or obtaining warmth and the fire is in a stove or installation of a kind prescribed by the regulations. 1999, c. 12, Sched. N, s. 3 (1). ........... Guess you need to find that ""regulation"". Would hope a firepit is legal... but I know one year you weren't even allowed cooking and warmth. To be absolutely sure... I'd make a call maybe?"
696828,hoby5,2012-05-16 14:42:00,42,Looks like the ban has been lifted in my neck of the woods. Has been raining for 2 straight days so its under caution status now but we will be able to have a nice fire on the weekend.
696832,johnnyb,2012-05-16 14:50:00,3413," Hmmm....might have to call.  Looking around the website I got when clicking on the link above said that you would have to use a stove for cooking.  Doesn't bother me....if we can't sit around the campfire at night, it just means we go try to find some shallow roaming walleye  bold added by me:  Can I Still Go Camping in a Restricted Fire Zone?  Yes, by all means, go camping, hiking, fishing, have fun and enjoy our most precious natural resource, but if you need heat for cooking and warmth, youâ€™ll have to take along a portable gas or propane stove.    When travelling in a Restricted Fire Zone, exercise extreme caution. Watch your propane or gas equipment carefully. Smoke only when stationary, never while walking or working in the bush, and make sure that all matches or cigarettes are dead out before disposing of them.    When an area has been designated a Restricted Fire Zone, you know the situation must be serious. Use your bush sense and act accordingly. Be careful with anything capable of starting a fire.  "
696933,irishfield,2012-05-16 20:34:00,26272,"Lookin like a coleman lantern is gonna be the only mood lighting you boys have out there. Better bring a stove or you'll be eating sushi! ALL of Ontario, that lies North of Barrie, is now a TOTAL ban on open fires."
696945,jedimaster,2012-05-16 21:14:00,3472,"From the map on the MnR wesbite it shows north of algonquin park, not barrie....  Page http://www.mnr.gov.on.ca/en/Business/AFFM/2ColumnSubPage/240351.html  Map link http://forest.lrc.gov.on.ca/AFFM/fire/interactivemap/RFZ/map.html"
696948,irishfield,2012-05-16 21:26:00,26272,Okay.. interesting.. this map was presented today online by a news agency..  http://local2.ca/ssm/viewarticle.php?id=5884
697193,johnnyb,2012-05-17 12:49:00,3413,"Yeah, we have a handy little cookstove....but coals provide such a better cooking experience.  BBQ's technically okay....so maybe we bring a metal tub and fill it with ""coals"" Just in case though....what's it cost to deliver some Chinese food to outhouse island, Wayne?"
697246,jedimaster,2012-05-17 15:00:00,3472,  Hmm... interesting indeed. Sounds like the old Bait and switch manouver.
697292,capt_hooked,2012-05-17 17:30:00,212,"The MNR just called us via telephone. This is pretty unuaual for them to make a special call out to us on this.  All fire permits are cancelled and no open burning is allowed whatsoever.  Cooking on gas or propane is allowed only.  It is promising to be a warm dry weekend, so I do not see the fireban being lifted.  The Ministry's fire fighting resources are already stretched to the limit.   the capt."
697308,Squid,2012-05-17 18:33:00,1656,I was planning on a weekend up north of north bay. No campfires kind puts a damper   on the whole experience. I guess that I will have to decide on whether to take the chance and have an open fire when I get there. Maybe have a pail of water ready if the fire gets out of hand ( doubt it).
697310,davey buoy,2012-05-17 18:39:00,5505,"What a great weekend for camping,but the fire ban sucks,have a good one anyways!."
697319,Rod Caster,2012-05-17 18:52:00,5784,  or don't start a fire at all
697455,woodenboater,2012-05-18 00:49:00,2277," Indeed it does take away *some* of the experience but I sure as hell wouldn't want to be nailed with a huge bill because a stray spark lit up the near north. One would also probably face charges as well if it could be proven where the fire started. As well, a pail of water would most likely be a bit inadequate if a conflagration started.  You'll have a better weekend up north sans fire, than me stuck in the city working on Monday."
697463,Christopheraaron,2012-05-18 01:01:00,3525,"What about solo up there in the bush, think he knows about this?"
697512,capt_hooked,2012-05-18 03:42:00,212,C.O. stopped in this evening with more info on the fire ban and posters to set out.  They are really showing a great deal of concern this time around.  I have never seen this much attention from the MNR regarding fires.  Evidently we now have help from as far away as Newfoundland supplementing our fire crews with water bombers.   Also no fireworks are allowed while fire ban is in effect.  Please respect and follow the rules as many folk in this part of the country base their livelihood on healthy green forests. A major fire would be devastating.   the capt.
697521,lew,2012-05-18 10:14:00,12766,"I sometimes watch Breakfast Television from Toronto for the news in the morning and tuned into the show a few minutes ago.  Turns out their doing an outdoor broadcast from Lake Rosseau in Muskoka today and they've got a bunch of the locals there and everyone is sitting around a big roaring bonfire.  You'd think at least one person would have heard about the fireban, specially those working for a large news channel"
697525,Roy,2012-05-18 10:21:00,13728,That IS weird isn't it Lew?
697526,Roy,2012-05-18 10:24:00,13728," With Mike's experience in the bush and knowing what he does for a living, I'm sure he's way ahead of us on this.  edited to add: The fact that you even brought this up shows that you're a thoughtful human being. Thanks."
