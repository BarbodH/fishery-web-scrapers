695437,mercman,2012-05-12 03:25:00,7054,"Just a quick one, then i am off to bed and will check in, in the morning.  I have an 8ft XH fast action St Croix Musky rod and a 7ft H fast action Compre. Which of the 2 should i rig as a trolling rod, and which as a casting rod? I have heard longer is better for casting Musky, and i have heard that longer is better for trolling Musky. I will expect an answer by morning...Nite everyone   "
695440,Fisherpete,2012-05-12 03:43:00,1814,"I used to troll with my 7' Compres and did OK, but was always worried about the rod snapping when a big one would hit. Last year I picked up an 8' Okuma EVx musky rod that has fiberglass in it - absorbs a bit of that initial impact, especially when the weather gets cold in the fall - and it is now my go-to rod for trolling. As for the length aspect - if you only had the two rods to choose from, I would make the 7' the trolling rod and the 8' the casting rod - the 8' should give you better casting distance, hooksets, figure 8's, etc."

695454,mike rousseau,2012-05-12 06:18:00,4661,I'd make the your...8.5 footer(...uh uhm...you don't even know your own rods...) your troller... Then if either doesnt feel right... Try switching em up... Cause in the end it's personal preference...
695455,Twocoda,2012-05-12 06:25:00,4130,have to have confidence before you can apply it...he is on team 2...whats that tell ya
695474,Roy,2012-05-12 10:36:00,13728,"I'd be using the 8'5"" for both applications. The extra fast tip isn't ideal but it'll do the job. Your back will thank you if casting heavy baits for more than an hour or two. The disadvantage to long rods for casting muskie baits is that they make doing figure eights more tedious especially if you're vertically challenged such as myself and even worse when your on a low boat. Another thing to consider is two guys on a short boat swinging 8'6"" rods armed with lethal weapons on the end is a recipe for disaster....be careful. For trolling I prefer a longer, slow action rod. Even more so if you're using it as a down rod."
695481,mercman,2012-05-12 11:22:00,7054,"Other than Roy and Pete, WTH are you guys doing up in the wee hours of the AM ? I appreciate your views. I was playng Rod Roulette this week, changeing reels and trying to find the perfect combinations with the equipment i own. For now you have helped me enormously, but i can see at least one more rod and reel in my future.Wish me luck wit da wife on that.  Now off to spend the day with Mom in Ottawa."
695485,Gregoire,2012-05-12 11:30:00,1397,"I would also want to know what reel you have on both rods and what baits you plan on casting. If I had to choose one for each application I would use the compre for trolling and the St croix for casting, escpecially if you plan on throwing a lot of blades or bulldogs, as the added length of the rod will allow you to make wider turns on the figure 8 and speed up the bait. If you are throwing glide baits  and jerk baits I would think that you would be ok with the compre."
695501,SlowPoke,2012-05-12 12:11:00,2984,"You're all wrong! Keep them both for casting and add another setup to the arsenal for trolling. Put a nice linecounter reel on a downrigger rod for trolling. The glass content in a DR rod is much more forgiving and the flex will show you when those big baits are thumping. When they stop thumping, your hook is fouled or you have speared a bait fish."
695523,Gregoire,2012-05-12 13:30:00,1397,Agreed on the trolling set up. It would only set you back a bout 150-200$ depending on the rod and reel choice.
695524,Harrison,2012-05-12 13:36:00,2202,"Hey Paul, the Muskie Canada guys grabbed up my first order of these I brought up here for trolling.  Just got a few more in if you'd like to have an eye..  http://www.etackle.ca/tackle-industries-8-musky-pike-trolling-rod-xh-eva-handle/"

695549,Big Cliff,2012-05-12 14:45:00,6899,I'd cut em both down to the same size then you wouldn't have to choose!
695610,Dontcryformejanhrdina,2012-05-12 18:36:00,535," Wouldn't longer rods make figure 8's easier? Certainly takes strain off your lower back. I like casting rods to be as long as possible. I have a 7'6"" jerkbait rod and I had an 8' MH for everything else but found it was too weak throwing big soft plastics so I picked up a 9' extra heavy and it adds distance to my casts and I feel I can really load up on it more with heavy baits."
695690,Billy Bob,2012-05-13 00:46:00,5865,Get a nice 6.5' rod for jigging and you will never use the other 2 rods again.......not really but trolling the boat catches the fish.....jigging YOU catch the fish.......
