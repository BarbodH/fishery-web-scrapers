With limited time want to make sure we maximize high percentage areas for this time of year Cheers Gordy"
696523,jimmer,2012-05-15 15:52:00,2730,"Sounds like you're planning everything right. The weeds do seem ahead of last year, so It's tough to find the emerging weeds to troll over. Stick to the weed edges and the lower the light conditions the better. You might want to try shallow weeds also if the clarity of the water is a little stained."

Balsam was super windy and rough.  We have an 18.5 foot deep hull boat and coming in we could only manage half throttle and still got a sore but and soaked. 1 eye about 17 inches or so, caught trolling with a flicker shad (Gary parsons doesn't lie lol) Couple of small perch as well No pics - forgot good camera in the car and cell phones were locked in the glove box to avoid ruining them Cheers Gordy"
697044,chris.brock,2012-05-17 01:20:00,4053,"I'd say you did pretty well getting one decent fish in that short time and windy conditions on Balsam, nice job"
697122,gordy28,2012-05-17 03:18:00,638,"Thanks It was fun The boat has a 150 optimal on it.  Typically you can't get it to troll at less than 3 mph.  Today with the wind, when heading straight into the chop she hit 0 mph and blew backwards. It was tough boat control lol we didn't even bother with the bowmount Balsam can get nasty Cheers Gordy"
