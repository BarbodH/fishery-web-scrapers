696966,mike rousseau,2012-05-16 22:14:00,4661,Well for anyone that cares... Or remembers my previous threads about issues I was having with my motor...  While I was fixing problems with the work I was doing... Little did I know there was another problem developing...  My head gasket went...  This is part of the reason I was having such a hard time diagnosing all the issues... Because there was multiple problems...  So in the end I took my motor to a mechanic and he found my compression was out of whack... And water in my oil.... So it should be the head gasket... Wich is a pricy fix...  Good news is the mechanic is a friend of my brother and is putting a rush on it for me... I dropped it off Sunday and they were  working on it Monday morning....  I'm hoping it's ready for the this weekend... Long weekend and I have to prefish for a tourney next weekend...

696984,mike rousseau,2012-05-16 22:43:00,4661,It's a father/son operation... And I'm pretty sure the old man used to teach the small engine course at the college... And the son is a race car driver... So combined they know their stuff...
