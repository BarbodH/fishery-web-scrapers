It's been kinda noisy on the cast and the drag was getting sticky.  Less than 24 hours later I have my reel back with new drive gear, new pinion gear, new drag washer, new yoke (whatever that is) and they replaced the bushing on the side plate with a bearing.  All for 25 bucks + HST.  I haven't had a chance to try it yet, but the reel owes me nothing. I was half expecting them to tell me it wasn't worth fixing at all."

In all honesty, if a fishing rod is going to break, it will happen within the first dozen times you use it. If a rod breaks 5 years down the road, generally it's got boat rash or beaten up and abused.  As for the reels, it's a good thing they don't have a ""cast counter"" on them. I think I put well over 2 years of wear and tear on a reel in one season and still don't have any issues.  FYI, I run Sahara's ice fishing, Stradics for bass and walleye, Curados for bass and Muskie along with a Calcutta TE, just to name a few.  Cheers, Ron..."
