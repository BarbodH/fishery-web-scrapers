My outdoors card expires Dec31/2013, the last time I renewed (2010) I also purchased a 3 year sport fishing; so I think I’m all set as far a licensing goes until the end of 2013. A was just talking to a guy that is saying no I must now have the yellow card to accompany my still valid outdoors card with the 3 year (imprinted) sticker? Is this right or am I ok until I need to renew?  Dan."
696584,davey buoy,2012-05-15 19:52:00,5505," Your sticker/card was paid for and done before all this new stuff,as long as it says 2013 on your card with the original sticker,your good to go!!"
696589,DanD,2012-05-15 20:01:00,2223,That’s what I thought but this guy had a petty convincing argument and got me thinking.  Thanks for the reply.  Dan.

696613,irishfield,2012-05-15 21:12:00,26272,Look on the back of the card.. says 3 year FISHING correct?! You're good to go.. and they still come that way if you buy 3 years at a time to skip that one year card crap.
696660,DanD,2012-05-15 23:01:00,2223, Good to know; I've always bought the three year anyway so I won't have to deal with this yellow card thing.  Thanks everybody!  Dan.
696834,cuzza,2012-05-16 14:58:00,467,"Just under the magnetic strip on mine it says ""Three year licenses expire with this card. All other tags are validonly for the year stated on the tag"" - so you're good til next year"
697061,marine5068,2012-05-17 01:58:00,26,"Yes, with any three-year fishing license, the tag is on the back and printed right into the card."
697215,zenon11,2012-05-17 13:35:00,75,"I have a 3 year card as well that says ""3 years FISHING "" on the back, but it does not indicate whether it is a conservation or sport licence. So are you guys sure you don't have to keep the yellow piece of paper?"
697281,Warthaug,2012-05-17 17:08:00,30,"Mine says ""3 Years conservation"", so perhaps the sport simply says ""Fishing""?  Bryan"
697304,davey buoy,2012-05-17 18:15:00,5505,"I'm thinking since this just started for 2012,if your still valid for this or the next year and you bought it before 2012,you are good to go.It's only this years licenses that are affected now.I don't think it can be explained any clearer:clapping:"
697313,cuzza,2012-05-17 18:44:00,467,What's the yellow card/paper people are talking about? I renewed my card online with a 3yr Conservation license and I don't think I ever got a yellow piece of paper.
697315,davey buoy,2012-05-17 18:49:00,5505, 3 year never changed.
697327,Woodsman,2012-05-17 19:24:00,1286,"The yellow card mentioned can be one of three things. They are issued at the ministry office or an approved license issuer. Online you print off a paper equivalent. 1. Is your temporary Outdoors card until your permanent one arrives in the mail. 2. Is you temporary 3 year license/licenses if purchased at the time you bought your Outdoors card. Both of these are not required after your permanent Outdoors card arrives with the imprinted 3 year fishing and/or small game tag. 3. Is your other tags bought as add on's to your outdoor card. For example one year fishing licenses, hunting licences ect. These you are required to carry with you when doing the activity they authorize."
