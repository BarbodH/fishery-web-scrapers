696932,bigugli,2012-05-16 20:26:00,6138,That will be the newest craze on the salmon tribs come the fall.
696978,hoby5,2012-05-16 22:39:00,42,Perfect photo of pushing the envelope ....
696981,mike rousseau,2012-05-16 22:41:00,4661, LOL
696983,Dutch,2012-05-16 22:42:00,831,That's a good photo shop.  No way that rod could throw over a pound of weight without bending right in half.
696993,mike rousseau,2012-05-16 23:02:00,4661, Looks like a big stick to me...
696997,rocheleauc,2012-05-16 23:22:00,205, LOLLL
697024,manitoubass2,2012-05-17 00:40:00,11391,"lol, that lure will hit em right in the back of the head on the cast, he should be wearing a life jacket!!!"
697177,blaque,2012-05-17 12:14:00,2419," I assumed its a photoshop job as well....(although the rig would be closer to 1/4 lb)....still thought it was funny though. I find the actual alabama rig ridiculous.......so this was hilarious.  And actually if you look, each rig has 5 wires for 5 baits........and the first 3 he uses 4 baits and ties the next rig to the 5th wire until the last one where he uses 5 baits. Its a well thought out photoshop if it is lol"
697183,Harrison,2012-05-17 12:31:00,2202,Randall Tharp proving a point with photoshop.
697255,blaque,2012-05-17 15:36:00,2419,"more i look at it, the more i think its a legit image......but its being used jokingly. LIke i said....u can just take one of the five wires and hook the next rig to it on down the line"
697488,Rod Caster,2012-05-18 01:49:00,5784,hahaha that would be a pain in the  with live bait.
697493,mercman,2012-05-18 02:17:00,7054," Ya, all them squirming mice would make a heck of a tangled mess for sure."
697499,bucktail,2012-05-18 02:31:00,1857,Im going to try one next week when i am up north. Wish me luck!      Darren
697502,mercman,2012-05-18 02:44:00,7054,  It must be a pain in the unhooking a fish from that rig.Especially if it gets hooked by all 10 of the trebles from 5 lures.
697545,Harrison,2012-05-18 12:09:00,2202," Actually it is no problem at all. Pike love this thing, I used swimbaits (4 hooks), but I plan on trying some inline spinners on the rig this weekend."
697556,mercman,2012-05-18 12:52:00,7054," Well...you dont know me First time i would use one, you would have to take me to the hospital emergency, where they would laff thier off at me."
697563,targaboy175,2012-05-18 13:27:00,76,lol . dude i got to give this a try LOL
697571,ehg,2012-05-18 14:43:00,2666, Maybe GreenCoachDog will chime in on the finer qualities of this setup.
