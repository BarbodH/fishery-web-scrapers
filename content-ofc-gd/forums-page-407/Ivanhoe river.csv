697126,hoby5,2012-05-17 03:27:00,42,Yea nice area for sure but much better fishing all around the river and its free access if your ever coming up this way again msg me and ill put you into some lakes where you can blow those numbers and size out of the water and best part is  not terribly difficult to access and its FREE to stay and fish aside from the usually camping costs.

697335,Pipefighter,2012-05-17 19:56:00,29,Ya sorry we did have one day of some nice jumbos I just didn't put any pics up we were pretty determined to get the wallys so didn't want to spend to much time on the perch
697414,Billy Bob,2012-05-17 23:11:00,5865,The wife and I did a trip back around 2008 and did very well out of Air Ivanhoe......we flew into his American plan lake....Nemogosonda Lake (spelling)......the food was none stop and VERY good......I caught LOTS of nice size walleyes but my wife caught the only pike......about a 8-9 pounder...great for her....  They run a first class operation from what we experienced......talked to a guy that has been flying out of his camp Monday and they have been killing the walleye out of the lake he mentioned to me......if you want the name of it PM me.
