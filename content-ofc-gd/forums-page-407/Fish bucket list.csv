I've landed one per year, all around 25-27"". Then a few days ago I landed two back to back at 27"". Then the next day, I had one turn on me a few times, that was 40+. Made me go nuts, I tried for that one fish all day, to no avail.  The good news is the river always changes, and it's looking like we might have a swing of muskies this year, for whatever reason. I really want to take advantage of that.  The other goal is a 50"" Pike. Biggest to date was a 47"" last year. This goal might take years and years, but I'm hopeful, lol"

696737,manitoubass2,2012-05-16 02:42:00,11391," I doubt I'll ever beat that, but I will try  BillM had one bigger, lol.  My 47"" was the best fishing story ever though, totally retarded the circumstances in which I caught it.  I was shore fishing with one other guy that I don't really know. But he was about 20 feet from me, so throughout the day we started chatting. We were fishing a drop off with a current break downside of the rapids. After an hour of so, I said "" I'm gonna put on a Berkley Ripple Shad, and I actually rigged it on a 3/8oz round jig head. Then I said "" I'm gonna cast it shallow on that sand, the big fish is gonna be there sunning"". I cast out towards the shallow shore, and the bait never even had a chance to sink, instant hook set. I think I actually casted the bait right into the fishes mouth, or so it seemed. Took both of us to land it on shore, it was very cool.    "

696744,manitoubass2,2012-05-16 03:15:00,11391," lol, no doubt!  My 47"" was quite the experience. Alot of the locals (who rarely fish) wouldn't even believe it. But I had my kids and one partner to witness it, good enough for me. I really wanted a pic, but that fish needed a quick release. I felt good about reviving it/releasing it quick. The way it peeled line on me is forever etched in my mind.   "

Buried herself in the weeds and I just brought her in nice and slow.  No fuss at the side of the boat either..  Popped the hooks, took some pics and back she went.   I've never seen a pike with a back as thick as that, an absolute monster for sure."

The spot is just a hop, skip and a jump from my place, so going back in the evening is a def. go when the girlfriend gets back home.  I'm just hoping that seeing muskies here becomes more normal, because its a very rare thing. Some locals actually lived here for 40-50 years and never even seen a musky on these waters.
