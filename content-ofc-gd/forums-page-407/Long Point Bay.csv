According to the regs, the boundry is stated as ""Lake Erie (eastern portion of the Inner Bay) - Walsingham and Norfolk Twps."" After a quick google search, I found a map showing the boundry on Stamp's Long point page.  My question is: are there physical buoys marking this area on the water? It's been years since I fished the bay.  We were considering trying our luck for some pike this weekend, but being unfamiliar with the area, I don't want to be anywhere near the sanctuary.  I also don't want to be gettting into any OOS bass during the spawn. Don't want to ruffle any feathers here, just looking for some advice.  Would it be better to avoid the bay altogether until bass opener?  We're just looking to get into a few C&R pike locally, since we can't get up north this weekend. Thanks."
