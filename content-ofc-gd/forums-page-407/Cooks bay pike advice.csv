697438,workwear,2012-05-18 00:07:00,592,cooks bay really isnt that big....might wanna try the south west side....you could prolly troll the whole bay in less than a few hrs...
697462,Freshtrax,2012-05-18 01:01:00,2215,Will probably focus on weed lines in the south end of the bay around the mouth of the holland. 7-10 ft.    I am just not shure if the might be in shallower baskin in that 26 degree sun on Sunday.
697472,LefroyFisherman,2012-05-18 01:15:00,602,You'll do alright in the 7-10 foot range  I'll be out Saturday

697516,sleepjigging,2012-05-18 04:12:00,207,Careful! Using mice might get you wacked by other fishman (while you are at the side of your boat with your fly down)

697655,Freshtrax,2012-05-18 19:38:00,2215,All stocked up on spinnerbaits after last weeks topic.
697660,mercman,2012-05-18 20:12:00,7054,"  I was blown away how well they work, and how snag proof they are.We were casting into dead cattails and floating branches and not one snag. My new favorite lure"
