697047,SirCranksalot,2012-05-17 01:30:00,3291,"Anybody try these. Would seem to be useful for steelhead, for e.g, in changing from roe bag to worm. Also would work as well as a normal snap when fishing with spoons. "
697086,Ralph Field,2012-05-17 02:32:00,1018," I have used these for flies under a float. Whenever I have tried these with spoons I usually loose the spoon, but I buy the smallest size and perhaps the larger size will work for spoons."
697155,cheaptackle,2012-05-17 10:51:00,849,I've used them for lead jigs successfully.  They're also the standard for stinger hook attachment.  Michael
697189,johnnyb,2012-05-17 12:39:00,3413,"Yep...have used them under the ice....very handy for stinger hooks, or finess presentations.  I like a swivel when using spoons though"
697259,Fishing yoda,2012-05-17 15:55:00,29,"Used these last year( heavy duty ones) got into it with a big pike about 40"" or soo and he bent it straight... don't know what happen but that and the leader were torn up realy bad. might be the huge weed bed he went into could have caused this be cause i heaved him out of there but they do work well!! i uses these when bass fishing beiliev it or not!"
697265,troutologist,2012-05-17 16:16:00,951,Stringease Fast Tach snaps are a similar product that are a bit more robust.  Awesome to replace a treble on a spoon and thread on a minnow head.
697574,jigsnreels,2012-05-18 15:00:00,133," I had a look at these and they seem to be very well reviewed.  I'm not sure I would completely trust a non-locking snap swivel (both for a fish making short work of it, as mentioned above, or for losing an expensive lure - as also mentioned above), but I'm getting my gear ready for bass season opener next month so I might give these a shot.  I do like the low profile and the convenience of these snaps."
697583,lew,2012-05-18 15:14:00,12766," I find all Stringeze products to be top quality, at least in my experience anyways."
697598,steel&chrome,2012-05-18 15:48:00,46,"I've seen some fly fisherman use tiny ones (dont know the brand name), very fast and efficient. As mentioned above, stringease makes some good ones."
