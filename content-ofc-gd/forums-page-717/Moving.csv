440555,crappieperchhunter,2010-03-06 04:17:00,2582,Welcome back Bruce. Get a goods nights rest and tackle your mountain in the morning. Send us a perch or smelt post just so we know you didn't lose you fishing equipment in the move.

Glad you didn't misplace the IMPORTANT STUFF and got out on the hardwater. Enjoy your brekkie.  BTW I just got a bag of them smelt out for tomorrow night. Son's 21's B-day and the family is coming over for cake. Those smelts are a favourite snack before supper while we are playing cards.
