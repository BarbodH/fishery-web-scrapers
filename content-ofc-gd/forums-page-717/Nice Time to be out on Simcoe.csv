Jaydub and I managed to ice some nice laker and we took a couple home each as well. Big thanks to Steve who taught us a thing or two about fishing on the hardwater.  Nothing huge (biggeest was right around 5 pounds)  but it was great to be out on such a nice day. I also have a video somewhere as well. Jaydub, feel free to add pics.  Now I need a Vex!!!! Those things are amazing. What we were after    "
