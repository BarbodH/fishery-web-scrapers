440539,Nanook,2010-03-06 03:58:00,565,"./   Nearly missed this one, gotta get on more often. Way to go Lew, and welcome to the 'hood, heck we're almost neighbors. I'm just East of Buckhorn [where's that.] I hope you and Diane have many memorable years ahead of you. Sounds like you got the perfect 'Paradice' there.  Are ya gonna teach the local Vol. Firemen a few tricks in your 'spare' time"
440560,cisco,2010-03-06 04:39:00,597,Beautiful spot there!!!  All the best to you and the missus Lew!  Hope ya ding some of the really big musky that're living thereabouts!
440597,pikehunter,2010-03-06 11:26:00,1659, Great looking place Lew. Glad to hear he move was a success. Those deer are just waiting for you to plant a nice little veggie garden come spring  Wishing you and your wife many happy years in the new digs.
440609,TroutnMuskieHunter,2010-03-06 12:36:00,1362,Beauty spot Lew...your own paradise!!....I'm really happy for you and your wife
440646,SlowPoke,2010-03-06 15:38:00,2984,"Nice Lew! We're still settling in at our new place but I've yet to see any deer and the neighbours are pretty tight lipped. Oh well, I guess they won't be asking to borrow tools!  Your post reminds me of a joke going around in email a bunch of years ago. It starts off much like your post; Day 1, peace and tranquility. By day 5.. ""it's still snowing and the plow driver accidently plowed in my driveway"". Day 12... ""when will this bleeping snow stop and if I see that plow today I'll bleeeping bleep him!"" I wish I could find it online, funny stuff."
440656,bigfish1965,2010-03-06 16:00:00,3382,Congrats Lew! Thats my old stomping grounds. Grew up on Clear Lake in the summers. Just down from Kawartha Park Marina. Lotsa nice fishing very close to you. Awesome stuff!!
441229,DT10Sam,2010-03-08 00:42:00,480,"Well Lew that is certainly paradise and glad your at peace with your surroundings, I know you will love there.  There seems to be a bit of a problem with your second image, the 3 deer that came up your driveway have either multiplied to more very quickly or you are now at the age where you need to get an eye exam  All the best to you and your family.  Kind regards, Sam"
441324,Chris,2010-03-08 11:35:00,405,"Congrats Lew, enjoy yer new digs!!!"
441330,lew,2010-03-08 12:11:00,12766,"Mornin boyz and thanks once again for all the nice comments. I'm just sitting here watching 3 piliated woodpeckers in the tree outside the window and 12 deer in the backyard, infact 3 of them are only 50' from the back deck.  Funny thing though as I never thought of deer as being aggresive or nasty before, but these guys are like a bunch of kids fighting over the last chocolate bar. The neighbor puts out 5 gallons of some sort of seed mixture a couple times a day and the critters pass thru my place on their way to the feast, but rather than everyone picking their own pile of goodies they'll fight over the same one. They get right up on their hind legs, nearly standing up-right and almost box with each other. Once the vittles are all gone though, their all buddy buddy again and wander back into the bush to digest their grub"
439929,lew,2010-03-04 23:29:00,12766,"Hiya guys, haven't been around lately while we've been getting settled in our new home in the country. We moved in over the weekend and things have been pretty hectic for the last few days as anyone who has moved knows all too well.  Hard to explain how fantastic it feels to finally be living in the country after a lifetime in the city. Were about 15 miles north of Peterboro and a mile down at the end of a dirt road and maybe 100 yards from Clear Lake. The only sounds I hear are the trees rustling in the wind.  Here's the view from the front veranda with the sun rising over Clear Lake this morning    And every morning & evening the neighbors wander into the backyard for a chat. This is from the back deck this morning. Right at the back of my property is a mile of bush with a trail leading right past my place that the critters use as a pathway.  Just as I'm typing this right now and looking out the window, 3 deer walked down the road, up the driveway and into the yard  Were gonna luv living here and it's a huge change in our life style.    Anyways, I just stopped by to say hey and test my new Rogers Rocket Hub. This thing is just as fast as Hi-Speed which is great as I was afraid I'd be stuck on dial-up.  I don't think I'll be around too much as I'm gonna be enjoying the great outdoors for everything it's worth.  Have a good evening everyone"
439935,Rich Clemens,2010-03-04 23:37:00,3131,You got yourself a great place there Lew.  Good to see your dreams coming true.

439939,Ron,2010-03-04 23:39:00,1683,"Looking forward to more pictures from out of your windows Lew. Perhaps we can all pitch in and get you to install a web cam! Seeing those deer in your back yard gave me that idea, what a piece of Heaven you got there!  Cheers, Ron..."

439973,Bernie,2010-03-05 00:39:00,3190,I am so glad for you Lew. It only gets better.
439976,Radnine,2010-03-05 00:42:00,1538," A tall fence will take care of those neighbours Lew, and you can shoot the deer. Don't get the two mixed up 'kay? Jim"
439978,Dutch,2010-03-05 00:46:00,831,"I know that place!  Just kidding, of course, but we're practically neighbours now.  Good luck and congrats on getting settled in.  Hope the kitchen reno goes really well."
439981,msp,2010-03-05 00:46:00,1336,Ha Ha  Good luck to you and yours in paradise.  I can bet that you will love it.
440000,tjsa,2010-03-05 01:15:00,1578,"BANG!!!!  Ooops, did I just say that?? I hear their tails make some nice musky baits. Lifetime supply there.  I know you won't do that, but do enjoy your new place Lew.  BTW, how far is it to any musky bait store????"
440001,Fisherman,2010-03-05 01:15:00,7201,I'm sure they are probably waiting for you to put out the table and have breakfast with them like these folks do: http://video.google.ca/videoplay?docid=196...ient=firefox-a#
440005,brkygetr,2010-03-05 01:29:00,425,"Enjoy Lew...can't say as we know each other but a man who takes and enjoys the fact that he moved from concrete to gravel is a champion in my books buddy!!!! Have at er', never look back...concrete ain't worth it."
440007,BillM,2010-03-05 01:31:00,17367,"Lew, wait until you have a few dozen Hummingbirds buzz around you this summer   My oldman who wasn't much of a bird person, is now the savior of the hummingbirds around my parents place, lol.   Has the feeders topped up with sugar water, oranges out for the Orioles, feed out in the winter for the turkeys  To funny..."
440013,Loonietoon,2010-03-05 01:42:00,1450,Looks real nice Lew... wait till you see soft water.......
440044,Pigeontroller,2010-03-05 02:38:00,2793,Glad you are settled in Lew! A well derserved destination. Enjoy the peaceful neighborhood.
440046,Beans,2010-03-05 02:49:00,3339,Not to worry Lew...You are not losing your hearing...  All that non-noise you hear at night is the sound of silence...rarely will you hear any sirens from ambulances or fire engines up this way...takes a bit of getting used to...  Just be careful driving during a snowstorm...we don't have lights and curbs on the roads to guide you like in the city...
440051,Daplumma,2010-03-05 02:54:00,1961,"Welcome to the country Lew,Is your place on my way to Lakair this summer? Joe"
