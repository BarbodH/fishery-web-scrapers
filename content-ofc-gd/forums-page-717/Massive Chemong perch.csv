441212,Ron,2010-03-08 00:20:00,1683,"Ah ha!  I know who you are now! ha ha ha!!!  Just so we don't give away the spot, I remember you moving your truck a few times to help block the wind. That rechargeable drill certainly did a great job on that 30 inches of ice too! I was the guy on the sled pulling a portable hut. Had I of known it was you Jer, I would have introduced myself.  We buggerred off in search of new areas to fish. Them there Crappies sure are tough to find. I got a few of those lunkers on Chemong, but believe you me.... I caught bigger ones on Rice.  Cheers, Ron..."
441216,mbosh1980,2010-03-08 00:23:00,349,nice to see zone17 producing quality fish through the ice. good job
441222,Leecher,2010-03-08 00:36:00,7832,"That is a big perch for sure Jer congrats to your buddy  Up here, the biggest perch I've ever seen was a 14""er caught by my daugther..... here's a pic of it    Leechman"
441244,Jer,2010-03-08 01:08:00,1426,"  Hey Ron, that must've been yesterday we were fishing near you. We haven't been doing so well down there lately.  Today we stayed north of the causeway. We caught a few nice perch every spot we tried, but the bite was never really on. The lunker was one of the last fish for the day.  The cordless doesn't really do as well as we had hoped. Only about 4 holes per battery. We had two batteries so at least that was 8 less holes we had to hand crank both yesterday and today. I think a 5"" auger would be much easier on the drill than my 6"". Today we fished alot of holes we had been at earlier in the week, we could just break them out with a crowbar. A power auger is definitely in need before next season. Hand cranking holes through 18 or 20 inches is just no fun at all."

441259,MCTFisher9120,2010-03-08 01:48:00,3761,"Congratulations dude...those 12""+ perch do circles around the hole...there fun for sure!"
441300,Dutch,2010-03-08 03:39:00,831,"Good job there, Jer.  I've seen longer perch out of the Kawartha Lakes, but none of them as fat as that beast."
