441012,oates,2010-03-07 16:09:00,151,"Hi all,  Just wondering, once the ice clears on the lakes, if I wanted to do some shore fishing for pan fish, when is the best time (soon as the ice clears or later in to the spring). wanted to bring a friend and do some perch fishing. Is it as simple as just go out when the ice is gone?  Will likely hit Simcoe on the innisfil/barrie side.   Thanks"
441018,Beans,2010-03-07 16:21:00,3339,You might have to wait a few days for the water to warm up a bit but not very many days...  One year off the pier at Orillia Beach Park after ice-out we got skunked but one week later the perch were in thick as thieves...
441034,musky66,2010-03-07 17:02:00,273,I know it would take a while for the Rock Bass to move back into the docks in the spring. I think they school up over deeper water in the winter and dont come back in until the water warms somewhat. Perch will move in sooner I think- they like to spawn around pilings and cribs.
