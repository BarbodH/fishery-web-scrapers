441155,icefisherman,2010-03-07 21:48:00,952,"Well,  We've started early trying to find some lakers...no luck in that department again...so Brian/Slowpoke made the executive decision of going after the white fish instead of wasting more time...lots of driving on the ice and we found them after checking few different areas.... Meegs and Willimas spoons both produced in 75 fow.... Done with both limits by 11am...missed and let go bunch more....played a bit with the perch (just dinks today) and Brian had to go back to work....great day out there...started with survival suits on finished in short sleeves Hope the shore line holds for one more trip before season close but it is a bit iffy at this point...pray for couple cold nights... Cannot be happier when I take someone fishing with me and he has such a great day out there...  Few shots from the day...                 Cheers, Ice Fisherman"

441237,asdve23rveavwa,2010-03-08 00:58:00,2690,"Way to go...Simcoe truly is amazing as Terry says...blows me away how many great reports come from that lake considering how close it is to major metro areas.  Really nice ""whities"", enjoy!"
