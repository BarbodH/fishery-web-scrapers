441220,kickingfrog,2010-03-08 00:33:00,8333,Man. I thought the lake was for sale.
441227,vinnimon,2010-03-08 00:41:00,2593,"I wouldnt doubt it.3 attempt in with no luck.the 4rth finally made a trek in until the rd was so bad that my cherokee wanted to turn around.I went in with a 79 impala,a little toyota tercel 5 speed hatchbck, and a 79 mustang 4 banger.I finally had a true 4 by 4 and had a blast.Oh and my impala made it through the first water over the rd pass, If you know the area, about a click in."

Once you get down to the lake and in your boat, head straight through the narrows , you have to go left once through and start trolling. Caught some decent lakers. You can access Orley lake just up to the right from the landing and Silver buck and Silver doe from the end where I told you to troll for lakers."
441407,troutologist,2010-03-08 16:43:00,951,"Pretty cool lake, went winter camping in on one of the smaller portage lakes once, nice weather and poor fishing.  Checked it out in the spring at ice out too, caught a nice laker and a couple of OOS bass on Sherborne...seems like a busy spot on the weekends.  When I went about 5 years ago everyone told me the road was horrible, but it was smooth sailing in a 2WD??"
441413,rfmcrx,2010-03-08 17:39:00,42,"i was in there last summer, Best to take a 4x4 in there in early spring as the road floods out. we took my jeep and my brothers toyota pickup. we had lost of car come past the campsite. Good bass fishing and laketrout fishing. If you go in with a boat or a canoe, take atrip into the hawk lakes and 3 brother lake. 3 brothers is full of large and small mouth bass. The best campsite  is at the boat launch it has a mile long sand beech."
