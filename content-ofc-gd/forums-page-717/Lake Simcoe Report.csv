Risti and myself made the trek from guelph to barrie this morn leaving at 5am on the button, I woke to hear Risti whistling for me downstairs in my kitchen at 4:35am because i slept thru the 430am wake up call from ...well.... no-one!  I forgot to set the alarm...he he.. We arrived on time to lake simcoe north of barrie(6th line) at 06:45 just in time as we where meeting up with someone else..  Got on the ice set up and ready to fishing in no time at all.. By 07:40 the first fish from Risti was iced!!!  nice laker 5.2lbs 24,1/2in long His First lake trout EVER!!!   Congrats on that one bud Within short time it was my turn!!  Before we knew it, we was heading home by 1030am with our limit and some great memories........"
