441235,kgeary,2010-03-08 00:57:00,82,"  My 9 year old daughter Seanna caught this beauty of a walleye in 27 feet of water in mid day on  the hottest day of August. She has caught 28 and 29 inch walleye in the past. Hayden even caught a 30 incher on a slip bobber. This one was 32 inches very thick , even the fins were thick. Until 2009 she and Hayden used slip bobbers. However she suddenly became more interested in jigging. I think the slip bobbers were getting boring. even though they caught lots of fish on them.  we typically fish for 2-3 hours on an outing. Seanna had been using a jig for the third time As soon as she set the hook on this big girl she and I both knew it was a good one.  We were fishing a large mid lake hump that topped out at about 5 feet there is a flat about 12 feet deep near the southern most end the flat is maybe 30 yards by 80 yards. the flat points toward 30 plus feet of water. a classic ridge dropping of into that deep water held fish on both sides. This one was about 20 feet off the ridge suspended about 10 feet off the bottom.  Seanna had been watching the graph and lifted her jig off the bottom to see what those big arcs were. well she found out pretty quick.  Just thought I'd share Waiting for spring getting a bit a anxious. been a wonderful winter. melting quickly the past 4 days."

441594,kgeary,2010-03-09 01:36:00,82,thanks frankie and archie  Sorry about the tease but we'll all be on the water soon. What amazes me is how quick the kids pick up on stuff. I only had to explain once - how to feel the jig touching bottom and to feel for the bite. and we were fishing in 16 -28 feet of water. I explained how the boat would move away from the jig and the line would lift the jig off the bottom etc etc.  That is why fishing is fun. you never stop learning and never stop teaching.  fun fun fun. kg
