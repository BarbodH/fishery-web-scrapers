I was wondering if anyone out there has fish pictures, any species, taken on Lake Nipissing (summer or winter) that they would like to donate to the cause, I'd be greatful.  Any other interesting pictures would be a great help too.  Please PM me.  Thanks in advance."

Even though they were caught on Nip. As I said ,I wish you all the best. I know you have to start somewhere, Start with the previous owners,they might have some pics"
