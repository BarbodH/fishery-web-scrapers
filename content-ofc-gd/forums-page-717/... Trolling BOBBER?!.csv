435809,rbaquial,2010-02-22 23:57:00,968,"Hey Folks,  Just wanted to know if anyone's EVER tried this out before...  I came across it by accident on the internet...  hahaha... looks interesting enough....  http://www.trollingbobber.com/  Your Thoughts?"
435816,muddler,2010-02-23 00:05:00,623,"looks like it's way to clubersome for practical use. Another fishing gimmik. The best allround bobber for lakes is a slip bobber 99% of the time.  Steelhead type fixed bobbers are good for depths less than the rod length you are fishing.  Light, sensitive and quiet bobbers are always best. All else is a conpromise.  Muddler"
435817,solopaddler,2010-02-23 00:13:00,8605,It'll go down in infamy just like the Bass-O-Matic 5000.  MMMMM.....delicious Bass milkshakes!

435823,Raf,2010-02-23 00:20:00,3495,"if you think about it, planer boards = trolling ""bobbers"" and they have the added bonus of putting your baits out to the side.  never mind, i just had a look at what this thing really does."
435824,Twocoda,2010-02-23 00:23:00,4130, except you release a planer board  should get the Sham Wow dude on this product....is there stock options?
435827,solopaddler,2010-02-23 00:28:00,8605, Ron Popeil has the market cornered.
435841,DRIFTER_016,2010-02-23 00:50:00,10439,Here's another directional bobber for flowing water.  .bulletbobber.com
435860,smitter,2010-02-23 01:19:00,106,"Yeah, I don't think I'll be buying one of those."
435990,Chrispy,2010-02-23 13:09:00,168,"Bought one as a joke last year in Florida.....Brought it up North with me on our annual trip with the boys.....I pulled it out, hooked it up and we all had a really good laugh.....that's all it was good for, broke after the second or third cast but was funny as all heck while it lasted......one of the best laughs I got on $3.00 bucks!!!  LOL!!   Chrispy!"
435994,rbaquial,2010-02-23 13:17:00,968, LOL!!!  Did you guys manage to catch anything?! hahahah... at least it was good for something! I was NEVER planning on buying this... I just wanted to hear others inputs..

436044,Chrispy,2010-02-23 15:52:00,168,"never caught anything but it did go down once and everyone on the dock stopped for a second and then started laughing again at it.....it was just going around in circles....I try to bring something stupid every year.....the year before I brought up this HUGE hook and a HUGE bobber, baited it with about 30 worms and threw it in the drink.....I got a nice eater walleye on it!!!  I thought some were going to laugh so hard they were going to fall of the dock.....I am sure the numerous beers helped in the fun!!!!  LOL!!!  Chrispy!"
436048,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2010-02-23 16:00:00,0,"hey bud, i got a fish whistle for sale.  all you do is put your head under the water and blow... and they come swimming! it's a steal of a deal at 9.99 + shipping and handling.  and after that, i got some magic beans for sale."

441283,John Bacon,2010-03-08 02:57:00,3277,Here is the go big or go home version; it is a little heavy to cast but does come with its own trailer.  http://www.seahorse.net.nz/
441327,BulBob,2010-03-08 11:54:00,6,This one is my favorite.
