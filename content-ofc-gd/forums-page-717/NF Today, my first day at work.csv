Well I had an awesome day today,all jobs went perfect.Except for the last job,it was going to be sent back into service with an oil leak.I was told to put it back together and send it on its way.Well,while putting it back together I found this little something that was causing the problem, I put 2 & 2 together and some of the right stuff on it(sealant),the boss aproached me and I told him the problem was fixed.His face dropped and it was 15 min to quiting time.  Hows that for a first day,I couldnt be more happier impressing the new boss.  Thanks to all, and have an awesome fishing season Cheers Vince"
