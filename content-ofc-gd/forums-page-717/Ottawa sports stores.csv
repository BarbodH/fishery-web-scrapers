Or am I stuck with BPS or heading stateside to Cabelas/GanderM?  cheers,  scugog"

They were just opening up when i last visited but they had kayaking gear and wetsuits so I wouldnt be surprised if they had rainsuits as well. Will see if I can find the name/contact numero of the place for ya.  Cheers, Fishingitis"
