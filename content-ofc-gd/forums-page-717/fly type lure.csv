440476,kgeary,2010-03-06 01:53:00,82,does anyone know the name of the yellow fly type of lure this guy is using near the end of this video.  he is using a spinning rod and it seems to cast well.    thanks kg
440486,vinnimon,2010-03-06 02:13:00,2593,I goto get one of those.Looks like a semi boyant frog imitation.Easy enough to make one.
440496,adempsey,2010-03-06 02:28:00,1498,"It looks like a typical pike fly to me.  I just picked one up today to play around with on my next fishing trip using my spinning gear and a bubble float.  It may or may not have a specific name, really.  Maybe a Bunny Leach?  Couldn't tell if it was made with rabbit fur or not.  Can check here:  http://www.pikeonthefly.com/Flies.html http://www.thefriendlyfisherman.co.uk/sect...pike-flies.html  There are some videos on Youtube on how to make simple pike flies as well.  Pike don't seem to be that picky."
440502,Syn,2010-03-06 02:37:00,519,That looked pretty cool. Saw it again in this video at 4:30  Its the red worm like thing that fluffs out underwater. Its cool how you can cast it out with spinning gear and it jut suspends. I will try to build one if I understand the weighting and boyancy system. Maybe cork and lead weight? Looked like wire going to the rear hook. ANyhow we need a name and some close up pics of it.  Looks like marabou type.  I'm suspecting it has something to do with BFT  big fish tackle? I can clearly see a larger treble  on the rear with a split ring and possibly wire. Wonder whats on the front for buoyancy/weight? Looks like painted green wood with eyes on it.
440544,kgeary,2010-03-06 04:03:00,82,It sounds like he says it has cork and lead I like that it has the weight to cast with a spinning rig and still nuetrally bouyant.
440549,kgeary,2010-03-06 04:09:00,82,dragon wobbler bunny looks pretty close. but not exact   http://www.thefriendlyfisherman.co.uk/s_pr..._wobbunny_Y.jpg
440551,Syn,2010-03-06 04:13:00,519,"   I'm gonna try making one with a wood head. I'll see what home depot has in the way of small wooden drawer knobs. IMO wood would be more sturdy to use than cork for pike teeth and will cast further. I could use cork on the wire near the rear to keep it horizontal. Don't know. It will take some playing around with for sure. Some clear epoxy over a painted wood head. It will have to be a neutrally buoyant wood, or slightly sinking, I think the epoxy might make it more bouyant, not sure.  I tried googling BFT european/scndinavian, and strike pro, can't quite find that fly though."
440553,vinnimon,2010-03-06 04:14:00,2593,I have a couple of them for bottom bouncing baits.I peice of wood and lead.If I dress it up it will look nice and purdy for dee pikies.Now I need to find kermit.Here Kermie I have a treat for you.
440884,kgeary,2010-03-07 04:07:00,82,JOHN GLYNN FOUND IT FOR ME. THANKS JOHN OH YEAH CAN'T WAIT.  http://www.tradetalk.com/Abu-Garcia-Hairy-.../p/272786/82/en  http://www.tradetalk.com/ProductImages.aspx?ProductID=272786
440885,irishfield,2010-03-07 04:09:00,26272,Looks like Rod Stewart's stage outfit.. circa 1976 !! lol.  Glad you found what you wanted Kevin!
440902,Syn,2010-03-07 04:49:00,519,"Awesome we finally got a name for it. I was thinking of doing Zonker strips on the wire and first 4/0 trailer hook. That rear treble could use a bit of shrink hose too.  Another picture of it. http://mariau.fr/phpBB_peche/viewtopic.php?f=22&t=98     edit: wanted to edit not add new post doh.  After doing lots of research I thnk I'm going to buy HARELINE magnum rabbit strips from bass pro or online. Crosscut for the body and lengthwise cuts for the twin tails I think. http://vodpod.com/watch/3157784-fly-tying-...disfly&mp=1 Cool catalogue--> http://www.epaperflip.com/aglaia/viewer.as...mp;page=1   edit, another hairy killer video http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xm_jWr-ZhRc&feature=player_embedded"
440923,dave524,2010-03-07 09:42:00,4508,"Except for the colors and the twin tails, it is not unlike the baby muskrat lures that were sold by both Webber and Marathon tackle companies 50 years ago. I'm guessing you would want to get it waterlogged before using as a lot of the casting weight would be water. Searching  ""Marathon ""or ""Webber "" muskrat lure will get a few examples of the vintage version for sale by collectors on eBay, for those looking to roll your own."
