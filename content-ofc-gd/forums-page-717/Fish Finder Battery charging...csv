It died about 2pm yesterday.... after using it at full screen intensity in the sunlight. This was about the time I was ready to move, for about 20 minutes, South down the lake to where Joey and Terry were. Thought to myself.. If I could just plug the batteries into my helmut visor heat cord! So today I added an RCA female plug to the finder box.. beside the existing plug I use for the wall transformer charger. Now when I move I can plug my helmut cord into the case and add some juice to my finder batteries while doing so."
