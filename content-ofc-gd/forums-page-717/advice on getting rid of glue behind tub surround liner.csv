That is what the OFC is supposed to be about, people helping people.

440412,tb4me,2010-03-06 00:45:00,3295,Home Renovator here..welcome to 2010 boys n girls..throw the cement board in the garbage.its heavy its nasty to cut and I wouldnt use it..Like everyone else says rip er down to the studs. Go get yourself some densshield or wonderboard and a Schluter shower or bathtub kit from home depot. http://www.schluter.com/6430.aspx follow the directions on thier website and I gaurentee you the best water tight shower that will last the rest of the life of the hiuse..BTW im a certified Schluter installer if you want to hire a pro!! The Schluter system will run you an extra 400 for a tub and up to $700 for a shower kit. Like I said if you follow the directions on the site it will never leak as long as the house stands. That will cut back on honey do list's of the future! The web site has tutorial video's on how to install. Just my opinion take from that what you will Happy Renovating!
440440,Radnine,2010-03-06 01:16:00,1538,"Bathtub Fitters did the surround in my old house. Top notch job and done in a day. My honey do list says ""get to work so you can pay people to do it right"". Good luck! Jim On another note, I am terribly sorry for your loss."
440449,tb4me,2010-03-06 01:26:00,3295,what did they charge you? I love it when Bath fitter is in a customers home before me..They make my job as a salesman soo easy..$4200 for a 3x3 shower..Pfft gimmie a break
440467,Radnine,2010-03-06 01:40:00,1538," Why, yes, for my full size shower it was a qwadrillion bazzillion dollars, what a dummy I was If your sales technique is to make everyone that bought something from someone other than you sound like a moron, you are going to need more than bathtub fitters to bolster your sales. The job that I had done was fantastic (as originally stated) and the price was very reasonable as I recall. I mean honestly, it was around 15 years ago but I remember being thrilled with the out come and the cost. I went to work and came home and it was done. Mind you, I have always been payed good money for good work and never begrudged returning in kind. We'll check back with your customers in 15 years and see how they feel. Jim (okay, maybe I'm over reacting)"
440492,tb4me,2010-03-06 02:23:00,3295," Not trying to make anyone look like a moron, sorry if you took it that way man..I have been self employed since High school. My work and satisfied customers speak for themselves. 25 yrs later and still no complaints. My sales technique's involve many years of skill and an amazing portfolio nothing more..I was just saying I love it when potential customers tell me on the phone (before estimate) that Bathfitter was just there..I know when I show them my smile, price , work and references its a sgood as sold. For what they offer the price is insane."
440607,mr blizzard,2010-03-06 12:25:00,1589,Thanks tb4me and Radnine for your help also.
440615,gdelongchamp,2010-03-06 13:06:00,199,I'm sorry but I couldn't resist this one. Tb4me I have been in the property management business for thirty years and I have hired a lot of contractors. Every once in a while I come across contractor gods like yourself.  I learned many years ago to stay away from them.  Enough time spent on this posting.
440642,Twocoda,2010-03-06 15:23:00,4130,"im just going to throw this out there for an option...If you choose to tear down to the studs ( which i would recommend) i would stay away from drywall /wonderboard around the area ....drywall in moist areas isnt a good idea  regardless of their coverings......cement board is very solid but is expensive and a little harder to work with ...should you go with cement board just score and snap it ....dont try to cut it with power tools (wear safety glasses if you do).... Dri-ply is basically plywood treated to withstand the conditions of the ever changing climate in a shower/tub area .....is solid to adhere to for a tub surround and supplies more then ample support.easy as plywood to work with and down the road when/if you decide to tile ...your base is already there ...its more expensive then drywall but not as expensive as cement board  Good Luck on your"" Honey Do"" list....if you have any questions feel free to PM me  i too am sorry for your loss"
440720,smally21,2010-03-06 21:46:00,993,"radnine you're not overreacting at all. excellent reply.  if the guy isn't trying to say you're a moron for going with bathfitters than why quote you?  i'm sure you could have taken a shot at bathfitters without quoting someone? i guess the thousands of bathfitter customers are all idiots for not going with some no name guy that might or not be around for warranty repair or have any insurance, or have a contractors lisence, or pay all his incometax, etc."

440818,moparhawk,2010-03-07 02:04:00,146,You might try a can of MEK. It will cut about anything but wear gloves or it takes all the oil out of your hands. Not gurt.

440931,gdelongchamp,2010-03-07 12:09:00,199,"Do not use a wood base for tiling in bathrooms. You will get rotting wood in a couple years.  I had it done twice ten years ago in two bathrooms and we had to remove all of the tile and wood as it absormed moisture through the grout lines. Yes of course the tiles were sealed several times. USE CEMENT BOARD. As for new products on the market such as denshield, it has not been time proven."
440932,gdelongchamp,2010-03-07 12:15:00,199,"Further to my last post about plywood, if you are using it as backing for a surround, one of the most common reasons to replace a surround is due to it cracking, holes in it or water bleeding through the caulklines. Then it immediately begins to decay the wood for a couple years and then when you decide to remove the surround and tile are you really going to tile on wood that has been affected by mildew and rot?"

441052,Twocoda,2010-03-07 17:52:00,4130,"  plytanium Dri - Ply......i stand behind my recommendation....i have two scrap pieces sitting out back that have been exposed to three years of midwestern ontario weather ...they look/ feel and are as structurally sound as the day i bought them..  furthermore...if you do choose to remove the PL and go from there ....a"" multi tool"" provides several different blades/scrapers that will literally cut the glue flush to the surface"
441233,moparhawk,2010-03-08 00:50:00,146,Not to add fuel to the fire but my company does over a million in bath remodels every year and has for a long time  so hopefully I have some credentials. Bath fitter has its place but I will say I can have my crews demo a shower/tub down to bare studs and subfloor and install a high quality shower from the Onyx Collection for an average of $800.00 less per bath. It takes two men two days. We elimate the mold we often find in the various substrates also replace damaged subfloors. I've always felt their cost of marketing and producing custom showers even when the majority are standard sizes adds greatly to their cost. When completed both are an upgrade from the origional thus meeting the ultimate goal.http://www.onyxcollection.com/
441263,splashhopper,2010-03-08 02:06:00,2931,"Lifetime warranties against mold and mildew are available by one of our suppliers on tiled walls and floors.   I personally prefer the Laticrete system because we are always called in for ""Sick, Tired Ugly Grout"" situations.  Grout failure and lack of upkeep on the caulking around the tub are a couple of the big reasons for water behind the tiles.  Whenever we do a makeover we will always suggest Laticrete epoxy grout for wet areas.  No stains and less than .1% moisture absorption( the same as porcelain tiles  .  By using  a CERTIFIED installer with the Laticrete thin set and the Laticrete epoxy grouts, a lifetime warranty can be given. ( labour and materials)  We only install over cement board or dense shield.... why.. because we are comfortable with it and believe in the products.  We were also involved with filed testing in a workout facility where the Laticrete system was compared to the Schluter system... from install to ongoing maintenance by the gym staff.  Laticrete won hands down... ease of maintenance and installation was simpler and more cost effective.  I can and will install Schluter if specified...  but cannot offer the lifetime warranty.

I have peeled our tub surround liner off only to find mounds of PL glue left on the tiles which are sound. I have been busting my    trying to get rid of glue, sanding scraping etc. I had surgery on my hand in the fall and it can only take so much. Any ideas appreciated. Tight lines."
439715,splashhopper,2010-03-04 16:37:00,2931,what are u putting back up ?

439723,splashhopper,2010-03-04 16:46:00,2931,  I agree whole wholehearted and I am a tile setter
439737,irishfield,2010-03-04 17:23:00,26272,"6"" grinder with 20 or 40 grit paper on the wheel !"
439739,splashhopper,2010-03-04 17:27:00,2931," what if he is ""saving the tiles""  we need more info please"
439742,irishfield,2010-03-04 17:33:00,26272,Yah we do.. but if it had a tub surround glued over the tiles he's trying to clean the glue off.. they're useless. If he wants to retile.. knock the drywall off the studs.. cement board it and have at 'er. New tub surround... grind the glue blobs down as smooth as you can and install the new surround.
439749,camillj,2010-03-04 17:43:00,1988,Yep .. I agree with Wayne .. sometimes we think we are saving time by spending a hundred hours 'cleaning up' something that would just be easier and better if was replaced... I know .. I am guilty as charged ... more than once
439750,tightline,2010-03-04 17:43:00,322,"That is exactly what I would do..if your trying to take grout off tile forget it...you haven't mentioned tile though so not sure where thats coming from...but if its just glued to drywall and you don't have a 6 inch grinder<---I suggest safety glasses and a dust mask for this method...cut the drywall rip'r down...its about 20 bucks for 2 sheets of watergrade drywall...no need to cement the cracks if your putting tub surround or tile back up...all you need is a olfa knife, a drill, a hammer and a caulking gun and you've got the making of a new tub surround my friend"
439758,mikeh,2010-03-04 18:05:00,824,"I'd suggest getting one of these scrapers, the handle is 12 inches long and the blades are 2 1/2 inches long and are pretty durable. I think it will come off with one of these scrapers and some elbow grease.  "
439759,pike slayer,2010-03-04 18:08:00,1177,"i agree!! grind the glue off or just rip the sucker down, i know i wouldnt not be playing with trying to take the PL off with a scraper or sand paper or whatever."
439767,Guest gbfisher,2010-03-04 18:19:00,0,I'd be faster to take it down to the studs. Re do drywall or sheetrock for a nice flat surface........patching sucks!!! Sometimes cutting corners only makes for more work later.
439771,Dara,2010-03-04 18:26:00,3052,"The wife wants it done...tell her to do it,,,you're going fishing.   But seriously...rip it down.  I redid my kitchen and had to take just the tiles down...it was easier to take the drywall down and put new up."
439773,Spiel,2010-03-04 18:32:00,9065,"I agree with those who said take her down to the studs. Then replace with cement board as Irishfield mentioned.  If this tub is on an outside wall it's also a good opportunity to check the insulation and vapour barrier as well, assuming there is a vapour barrier."
439775,gdelongchamp,2010-03-04 18:34:00,199,"If and when you get all the glue off and the tiles are sound and you plan on installing another tub surround put a susbstrate on the tiles first then use your new glue. Some glues will react to hot water once the new surround is installed and begin to swell leaving bumps all over your surround. Use a good quality surround and refasten using contact cement instead of glue. If you have never worked with contact cement talk to someone who has. It can be very tricky. One mistake any your new surround is toast.  The proper way would be to remove all the tiles to the stud walls, install cement board (stay away from drywall or water resistane drywall) and reinstall your new and beautifull surround and   you know it will last you twenty five years no matter how much you use it."
439776,splashhopper,2010-03-04 18:37:00,2931,i think we are all in agreement here..... hope the original poster sees this.
439811,HTHM,2010-03-04 19:58:00,4082,"Except for me, yes do use cement board, but tape the corners and joints, with fiberglass tape and Durabond. The joints only need one coat and the return on wall strength is incredible."
439814,Spiel,2010-03-04 20:04:00,9065,  Solid advice.  Thanks Albert.
439905,splashhopper,2010-03-04 23:02:00,2931,"  now we are telling him HOW to do it.... geesh... lol ( i do the same and use durabond 45-- git er dunnnn quick though)  and while we are on it.. if he is gonna put tiles back up.... use epoxy grout... no mold.. no stains...equals no ""honey due list""  and he still hasn't popped in to get all the help asked for ..."
439907,canuckjack,2010-03-04 23:03:00,121,"I agree with all the posters saying rip er down to the studs.  I redid a bathroom here, 30 yr old home, and after all the issues I found behind the walls and under the floor I was glad I didn't cover it up with another layer.  The cement board recommendations are good, I went with Dens Shield for the walls, great product, I found it easier to work with.   I used Cement board for building the threshold for extra strength and found the easiest way to cut it was with a circular saw.  Did a full stand up shower with tiled walls over Dens Shield about a year ago and she looks as good as she did the day I finished grouting."
439908,irishfield,2010-03-04 23:05:00,26272,  He's too busy scrapping !!!  ..and why wouldn't we try to tell him how to do it??? Are you hoping he calls..
