439984,lookinforwalleye,2010-03-05 00:49:00,4399,Never thought I would be cheering on Orr!!!  Nice job on re-arranging Lucic`s nose!LOL
439986,southpaw24,2010-03-05 00:51:00,32,I was just getting some salmon done up for supper and just caught the tail end of it. pretty good tilt. Orr is one of the best fighters in the show
439991,Radnine,2010-03-05 01:01:00,1538,"You forgot to say ""NF"". I thought you were going to say that Colton Orr had been given his own fishing show. Jim"
440008,uglyfish,2010-03-05 01:32:00,981,it was a good bout between the 2!!

440055,radar,2010-03-05 03:09:00,138,More likely to be an early golf show this season
440083,GBW,2010-03-05 04:27:00,8460,"hey, Ken H has a show so you never know...  and wasn't Nick A a guest on fish tv all the time when Owen wasn't around?  LOL"
440091,GBW,2010-03-05 04:49:00,8460,for those that missed it like me...  http://www.hockeyfights.com/fights/93016
440109,TerryC,2010-03-05 06:24:00,196,"Thanks for posting the scrap GBW.  Lucic is brave mixin it up with a big boy like Orr, although I don't think he would do it again.  Clarence"
440172,jediangler,2010-03-05 13:59:00,1923,All that matters was Miroslav's EVIL deke on Giggy to end the game. Go Bruins.
440202,MooseMerch,2010-03-05 15:14:00,68,  not a bad tilt
440218,JohnF,2010-03-05 15:53:00,3494,I'm afeared NHL hockey all looks pretty pedestrian after those Olympic games. Perhaps it'll pick up once the top teams settle down to the playoffs. Even tried watching Major Junior play last night. In the meantime I might have to watch something else. Fortunately there should be some great curling in the next few weeks.  Hopefully I'll be back in the mood next fall.  JF
440224,uglyfish,2010-03-05 16:25:00,981,"i thought last nites game was great. up tempo play, great goaltending, hard hits, some nice goals and a couple good fights. thats how hockey should be! that was a better game then most of the olympic games.  the canada/usa game would get higher praise because of the national rivalry. but as far as the game itself, both were equally entertaining to watch."
441097,yakpiker,2010-03-07 19:33:00,160,"I agree with JohnF on this one...comparing last night's Leafs vs Senators game with Canada vs USA doesn't make any sense to me...no offence, just stating my opinion.  Maybe the NHL is just like the Olympics, except for the fighting and the skill levels.  Can't wait for the playoffs!"
