441153,Twocoda,2010-03-07 21:39:00,4130,its a man made lake that isnt very deep....if there is ice on it ....i wouldnt trust it ...
441156,FisherMike,2010-03-07 21:49:00,108,"it is a man made lake.  the deepest part is about 40 feet.  ive ice fished there mulitiple times.  last i heard there is still a good 12 inches, however with these warm temps forecasted you'll definitely want to be be careful around the edges.  the lake gets very good ice, just stay away from the dam.  as for fish, there are walleye, pike, perch, LM and SM bass as  well as carp and sunnies etc.  be careful out there."
441165,FisherMike,2010-03-07 22:15:00,108,i should also mention that the temps in london for the next few days are well above zero.  if you do decide to go id definitely bring a spud to check the ice and i wouldnt recommend going alone.
441215,Laker272,2010-03-08 00:23:00,45,"Sounds like my best bet would be to skip it. Oh, that hurts. It will be after dark before I would get there so I think it may be wiser to stay off. Thanks for the input guys, you may have just saved me a soaker."
441217,scugpg,2010-03-08 00:30:00,1373,Not sure what you're after but there's lots of opportunity in the river around London as well. Hopefully we don't get a huge rain though as it'll blow everything out for quite a while.
441228,rob v,2010-03-08 00:42:00,535,Hey Scuqoq - I'm relatively new to the fishing scene here in london also.   You meniton lots of opportunity in London on the thames -  without giving away your honey holes - would there be any specific areas you would recommend - and for what species ?   thx.
441251,shane,2010-03-08 01:21:00,652,Walleyes come up the river from Lake Erie and should be showing up in the London area by now.  Any where downstream from the city is good.  But you better check the regulations because I think there is a ban on walleye fishing in some sections now.
441321,scugpg,2010-03-08 11:05:00,1373, It closes up on the 15th.....used to be open all year.
441342,The Urban Fisherman,2010-03-08 13:26:00,2050," are you right in the city Rob? or on the outskirts?  I wen to school in london and fished hte downtown section pretty hard... Shoot me a PM if you think you'll ever be fishing the downtown stretch of the river...  cheers, Ryan"
441438,rob v,2010-03-08 18:43:00,535,"hey Ryan,  p.m.'d you .  thanks."
