440753,lew,2010-03-07 00:03:00,12766,"Many of you will remember this picture, and for those of you who aren't familiar with it, my only brother was a member of this board for a few years but sadly died of cancer a couple years back.  Ed and I were extremely close and fished together all the time and his death really hit me hard.  After his death and totally unknown to me, Joey from this board got hold of a favorite photograph of mine of Ed and I fishing the BOQ,  then got a group of OFNers to VERY generously donate some of their hard earned $$$$, and then they contacted another board member, the very talented artist, Pamela Dallaire, to paint the portrait.  As I said previously, I knew absolutely nothing about any of this until one evening Joey & her husband Paul (Tybo) showed up at my house in Toronto and presented me with the painting. I was totally floored by the gesture and to this day can't believe the kindness and generosity of the members of OFC  This is the painting    And I just wanted to show those generous friends that I've now got the painting hanging in the  den of my new home for everyone who comes to visit to see as they walk into the room.  The kindness of OFC will never be forgotten.  Thank you once again to everyone involved  "
