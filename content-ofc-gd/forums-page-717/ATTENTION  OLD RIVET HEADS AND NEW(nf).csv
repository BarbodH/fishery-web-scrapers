Not sure if it's going to be a ""one of""  as everyone involved has day jobs, but I expect it to be the premier rock CD of this year. At 60 years old, I grew up with Clapton, Page and Beck as guitar heroes, Bonamassa is every bit as good IMHO, probably technically better.  http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermo...wsitemID=135451  Have fun at the show and play it LOUD."
