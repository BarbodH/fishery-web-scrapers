441043,Terry,2010-03-07 17:26:00,14456,yeah I have been checking out the video and will have to give it a try but there is still a set of bones in the meat
441049,Twocoda,2010-03-07 17:42:00,4130,yummy ....nice shooting ...kewl video too
441054,fish-miester,2010-03-07 17:56:00,864,"  same, i'll try it but theres still the ribs in the meat"
441056,MCTFisher9120,2010-03-07 18:07:00,3761,I can do it in 9seconds flat....just sayin
441059,tjsa,2010-03-07 18:14:00,1578,"Neat, I do clean some larger fish that basic way at the start(walleye and bass) but never thought about doing it that way with a perch. I am sure because of the smaller size of the perch it will work on them other than larger walleye or bass. If I catch a few perch, I am gonna have to try cleaning them that way. It seems too easy, but with practice, who knows.   Terry, I agree there will still be some bones in the meat, the lateral bones, but after cooking them they are basically not an issue, unless you are thinking about the bones while eating them. My mom was that way, always thinking about possible bones in fish. I just ate them. Never an issue for me."
441069,Mykester,2010-03-07 18:36:00,241,Old but still cool.
441136,brifishrgy,2010-03-07 20:58:00,559,gonna have to give that a try .. all I have to do now is catch some darn fish
441163,Bill Shearer,2010-03-07 21:58:00,456,First time I've seen it! Impressed the hell out of me! Thanks!
441169,yakpiker,2010-03-07 22:20:00,160,Anyone else notice the timer shows 1:10 when the cleaning is done?  Sure hope I don't come back as a perch in my next life.
441172,Bill Shearer,2010-03-07 22:39:00,456,"Probably think that the upload time had something to do with it,but at any rate a much better option from what I'd been using! I love Perch, as one of the better 'food groups' of marine life!!  This just fills-in the catch-to-eat- ratio!!"
441184,Mike Pike,2010-03-07 23:11:00,1332,"Tried it a few weeks ago and wow, what an easy, fast way to clean a mess of perch!  I still can't do it in 10 seconds, but waaaaaay faster than my usual fillet method.  Sure you have still have the bones in but the ribs just pull right out when you grab the back bone and pull the meat away.  Looks great on the plate and very little meat is wasted on a very little fish.  Love it!"
