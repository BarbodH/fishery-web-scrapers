760964,karmatt317,2013-01-20 17:46:00,3,Hahaha that's awesome . See these in martindale sometimes
761263,Mike Pike,2013-01-21 19:13:00,1332,"Hey Mike, are you saying the fish you are pictured with there is a hybrid?  Either way, it's a real beauty!"
761421,T Dot,2013-01-22 01:19:00,18,wow!
761425,MJL,2013-01-22 01:25:00,2427," Mike, I believe that fish was a koi/carp hybrid. I have caught goldfish/carp hybrids as seen below. Notice the long fins and tail  "
761451,Mike Pike,2013-01-22 02:59:00,1332,Gotcha Mike.  It's a gorgeous fish as is that hybrid you got yourself there.  Some exotic stuff!
760438,adempsey,2013-01-18 20:40:00,1498,Some guy was ice fishing for perch and pulled this up.  Good grief!    Watch the video on CNN here
760443,danbouck,2013-01-18 21:06:00,4380,They don't put up a fight  
760445,grimsbylander,2013-01-18 21:10:00,3016,How that fish eluded St. Clair musky is a miracle! Fat and bright orange are a bad combination.
760450,Twocoda,2013-01-18 21:28:00,4130,seen that on the news last night ...i caught one of the multi coloured gold fish in a Sparta quarry years ago...Agreed....not much of a fish
760465,hammercarp,2013-01-18 22:06:00,964,There are lots around here. We catch them all the time. When I was a kid the harbour here was loaded with them. I caught my first one back in the 60's at Valley Inn.  They were even along the shore of Lake Ontario. I can remember swimming amongst them where Cofederation Park is now. There were imported to north america even before common carp were. I caught two in one day.  This one is a little fancier.   They are not coloured common carp but are a different species carassius auratus.
760472,OhioFisherman,2013-01-18 22:17:00,6623,"A fairly common sight here on the south side of Lake Erie since I was a kid. Funny though, you never saw small ones, even in the back bays. A red flag in front of a bull? I think their color made most of them easy targets."
760480,hammercarp,2013-01-18 22:38:00,964,I saw an osprey get one .
760484,BillM,2013-01-18 22:50:00,17367,"Are you guys killing them or putting them back in the lake?  Looks like some great muskie bait like already mentioned, lol"
760486,outllaw,2013-01-18 22:53:00,1232,i wish i could say i am amazed. they have been around for a looong time. we have fresh water jellyfish also plus throw in the odd piranha lol.
760510,MJL,2013-01-19 00:15:00,2427,"I see lots along the Toronto harbourfront. I remember one summer I tried catching a nice big one but it eluded the hook.  On that note, gold fish often join spawning carp with mating festivities and you can get some nifty hybrids  "
760512,hammercarp,2013-01-19 00:21:00,964,Neat looking fish Mike.
760515,hammercarp,2013-01-19 00:24:00,964,I just wanted to clarify for others. Didn't mean to imply anything else.
760525,superdad,2013-01-19 01:11:00,353,Must have been flushed down the loo!!!!!!!!!!!!  David  aka  Superdad
760527,Christopheraaron,2013-01-19 01:22:00,3525,Rudd...
760530,kemper,2013-01-19 01:26:00,2232,"When I was a kid I used to catch a ton of them in  the local flood retention pond. Awful fighters, but a fun way to kill an afternoon when you're 8."
760536,buick14,2013-01-19 01:34:00,741, That looks like the whirlpool in niagara.  That fish is Nasty and awesome at the same time !
760541,Handlebarz,2013-01-19 01:52:00,3790,Well if that lasted to get that fat with all our skinny lsc musky around I will not run orange baits this season
760591,outllaw,2013-01-19 11:24:00,1232,most guys use the hotdogs that come 10 in a pack.excellent under a red/white boober
760593,Handlebarz,2013-01-19 12:17:00,3790,Oh sure you had to go there again
760594,outllaw,2013-01-19 12:23:00,1232,lmao mike. those brenners wood choke that carp waaaagh
760596,Rich,2013-01-19 12:52:00,3927,And nobody said you did..
760612,Handlebarz,2013-01-19 14:01:00,3790,Yes that is our summer time dog Mikey does not care and I would think after the nuker they all taste the same
760621,outllaw,2013-01-19 14:38:00,1232,mikeys priceless lol.. this chuckle has made my mornin.
760643,Handlebarz,2013-01-19 16:53:00,3790,What because he shows up to your house in his swimming trunks to swimm in the dogs water dish?
760820,hammercarp,2013-01-20 03:01:00,964,Some part of us never grows up. Your right about the fight though.
