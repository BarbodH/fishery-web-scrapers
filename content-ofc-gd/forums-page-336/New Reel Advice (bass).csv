761105,moxie,2013-01-21 00:42:00,1566," revo sx; Rario 7:1:1,  12lb Drag"
761122,Luke V.,2013-01-21 02:16:00,286,Moxie  The sx is on my list of reels to look for
761129,OhioFisherman,2013-01-21 02:49:00,6623,"Those drag numbers only seemed to have become an issue since they made it one? How many of us fish for bass in an area where 15 - 20 pounders are present? Just my view? It is a marketing ploy. Granted you are in an area where bigger fish are present, muskie, pike and such, just my experience fishing up north? If your not using a steel leader, floro or whatever it might not matter much anyway?  LOL, I competed in bass tournaments here for 30 years or so, locating them was always more of an issue that the tackle I was using. Once I stuck them? loosing them was never an issue unless I made a poor hook choice for the water, light wire hooks aren`t the way to go in slop, or where bigger than average fish are common."
761133,Luke V.,2013-01-21 03:01:00,286,"You bring up a very good point.  Yes there are bigger fish in the areas that I fish in. However running into one or two would not be a deciding factor for my reel choice.  No I don't live in an area where there are bass even close to 15 lbs. but it was just a compassion. I don't muscle my fish to the boat. I tend to play them out and let them come to me. How ever fighting fish in heavy cover, around docks, pilings, etc it seems to me that the goal is to get the fish away from the cover as quickly as possible. So if it has a higher drag, it won't be able to pull any line, and if I were hauling a big clump of weed with it I would not be under powered."
761136,moxie,2013-01-21 03:13:00,1566,"  Understood but the concern is the slop and junk that comes into play when flipping cover so its nice to know you have the drag power to rip through and haul in when the need arises.   Just a side note, BPS carries some great reels at an affordable price. Just because a major brand name isn't stamped onto the side plate doesn't mean they aren't worthy of a look. It doesn't always have to cost $200+ to purchase a well made reel that can be functional, reliable and be so for years.  All that glitters is not gold."
761145,uglyfish,2013-01-21 03:32:00,981,"i would grab a shimano chronarch 51E small and light weight 6.3 to 1 gear ratio power and speed in one! can usually find one on sale for a good price. fishing world usually has a great spring sale each season with amazing prices. i would bump up the 50lb line though. use 65lb power pro super slick, or 25lb flouro. better to have more line power and not need it then less and break off. and it happens lol.  i know u mentioned the chronarch was at the top of ur price range, but it is well worth the money. i own 2 for flipping, and 4 other chronarchs with more coming this year!"
761146,ah_long,2013-01-21 03:34:00,354,"drag # would be the least of my concerns, my chronarch D7 has less drag power than an Abu but I never had issues hauling fish out of junk.  I'd be more concerned about gear material and design as that would directly impact the reliability and smoothness of the reel. Say if you get a used Zillion, you can always get a set of carbontex drag for about $10."
761162,OhioFisherman,2013-01-21 05:10:00,6623,"I have used everything from 60`s and 70`s era Abu`s and Shimano`s from the late 70`s on up, even some spin casting reels at times, I usually had the drag as tight as I could get it for flipping, and it was never an issue.  If you ever saw Bassmasters from the 1970`s? all you saw was a lot of round red reels, they seemed to be able to do everything with them? but that doesn`t sell new more expensive products? Not implying that today`s tackle doesn`t have some advantages."
761170,TrippyJai,2013-01-21 11:36:00,28,"Just pick a reel that is comfortable. It doesn't matter which reel you end up choosing, almost every reel is capable of getting the job done. The reason why people prefer a fast gear ratio is to pick up slack line quickly to make the next cast. In reality, a 6:0 vs. 7:0 is like 3 inches per turn and in close distances, you won't notice a thing. Don't use a cranking reel (5:0) because you don't need the torch from the reel, once you set the hook, it's all about your rod moving fish out of cover. If you don't have enough power, then you need another rod that will give you that power. As for drag, I've never had an issue with that for bass fishing, the guys down south are using the same gear we are and they catching bass 2x our size."
761180,Court R,2013-01-21 13:25:00,213,Brand new $100
761188,bigmac1984,2013-01-21 14:07:00,193,"My vote is also for either the Shimano Curado 200E7 (7:1 gear ratio), or the new shimano chronarch 200E7 (basically the same reel as the old 200E curados)... I have 7 of the curados and do alot of slop fishing, frogs and flipping, and NEVER had a problem getting 4's and 5's out of the grass, so as someone mentioned earlier, I wouldn't worry too much about the drag. As you mentioned, you already picked out a rod, so when you go buy a reel, take the rod with you and try potential reels out on it, see how it feels, because at the end of the day, you have to be flipping with it all day and an unbalanced setup won't be fun.  Good luck"
761196,Luke V.,2013-01-21 14:57:00,286,"Thanks for all of the replies everyone.  Ah_long, brings up another great point. The gears will see a high amount of shear stress on the teeth, leading me towards a reel with better material for the gear set.  From all of the posts about drag, and drag pressure its leading me away from need a high drag pressure for this.  I would love to be able to put a chronarch on the rod. New ones are too much for what I am willing to spend, finding a used one isnt the easiest as people like to hold onto good gear.  Lighter weight will make a difference after a long day and making a couple 100 casts/pitches. Ballance will also play a large roll in the reel I choose.  Once I get the rod, we will see what reel I end up choosing."
761208,Ainsley,2013-01-21 15:41:00,142,I just got a flipping stick at the end of the season but I plan on putting my curado E7 on it.  I decided on a dobyns champion 765c and it seems like a very nice rod. The chronarch D7 or core 100mg7 would be my top choices but availability and price (respectively) are limiting factors.
761213,Harrison,2013-01-21 16:10:00,2202,"Buy a used superfree curado or cronarch off ebay.  All you will need for flipping/pitching.  As for darg, there should be none.  So as long as it holds, all that matters,  Spending lots of money on a flipping/pitching reel is a complete waste of moola IMO.  that money s better spent on spinning gear.  edit to add...  AS for line.  Straight braid, 50 to 65lb is perfect.  As for 'kind""... for this technique you need basic braid.  Cheap(fray, lose colour - who cares. Strip 20 ft, continue).  Colour.. whatever floats your boat.  I use bright yellow as do most my buds now. Colour the end with a sharpie."
761437,Luke V.,2013-01-22 02:09:00,286,Thanks for the tips about the line Harrison!
761460,T Dot,2013-01-22 03:47:00,18,"I'm a Shimano Curado fan too.  High speed reel is a must.  Think about how many presentations you will be making - now think about how much line you will be pulling in each time.  If you already picked out a rod, I say go into your local shop and put on a reel.  Make sure the reel feels comfortable and doesn't cause your hand to cramp.  Ergonomics will play a huge factor on how long you will fish...  GL"
761770,Rich,2013-01-23 11:29:00,3927,"You're talking about a casting method where casts are rarely longer than 10 feet away. Use any baitcaster you like, I think the line you put on it is far more important."
761783,Luke V.,2013-01-23 12:35:00,286,Thanks for everyone's replys. I ended up grabbing the Quantum off of Court R.  Good deal and a decent reel. Threw some 65# power pro on it yesterday. Tested it out in the garage for an hour or so. Seems like it will work really good
760943,Luke V.,2013-01-20 17:10:00,286,"Flipping and pitching are new techniques to me. This year I would like to explore them more and am designating a combo towards those two techniques. Yes I know that they are different techniques but I think I can get one combo that can do both.  As some of you may have noticed I have posted as add for a used Flipping.pitching stick. To witch I have had some great replys. (you never really know what is out there until you ask)With that being said I have set my eyes on a Powell Max 734c. This rod is 7'3"" has a heavy power and a fast tip. I think this will be a great starting point for learning this new to me technique. (thanks again Vince)  With the rod choice out of the way, my question is which reel?  Mainly I will be fishing here in the Niagara Region, Upper and Lower Niagara River, Lake O, Lake Erie.  I have done a bunch of reading and it is all leading me towards a lower gear ratio reel. Something 5:1:1-5:3:1  my price range would be around $150-200  This leaves me with lots of options. Currently I am running lots of different manufactures equipment. Have Shimano, Okuma, Abu for reels rangining for 80-300 bucks.  I will not add any Bias Error here and leave my ideas out.  Sorry for the long read. Let the discussion  begin "
760946,GBW,2013-01-20 17:19:00,8460,what about Ardent reels?  I hear they are very good for that and a good pricepoint too.
760955,Luke V.,2013-01-20 17:38:00,286,Those are definitely in contention. Do you have any experience with them?  (Bonus the Flip N Pitch are currently on sale!)
760957,rocket09,2013-01-20 17:41:00,18,"Hello Luke, I think you might want to look at a high speed reel for flipping or pitching. You want to be able to pick up the slack line as quickly as possible. I use a 7:1 ratio reel for both applications. If you can wait you can get a great deal on a reel at the Hamilton fishing swap meet, I believe it is in April and there is a tonne of bass guys there selling mostly bass tackle. Hope this helps, chris."
760965,Luke V.,2013-01-20 17:48:00,286,"Chris,  I get that the higher line reteive speed will be good for qucik hook sets. However do they have enough power to winch/pull a 6-7 pound bass through thick slop? That is why I was think the lower gear ratio."
760983,rocket09,2013-01-20 18:28:00,18,"Hi Luke, I haven't caught that many 6-7lb. fish but the higher gear ratio has handled 5lb. fish pretty well. Most of the time you don't have much line out of your reel, and most people flip with heavy braid 50-65lb. or heavy flurocarbon 20-25lb. They also use heavy action flipping sticks with a great deal of backbone and not much tip flex. Just make sure your drag is cranked tight. chris."
760997,Luke V.,2013-01-20 19:15:00,286,"Thanks Chris,  My plan is 50# Power Pro Braid  I Think that you put out a good point, 20-30 feet of line, 60 at max is what will be off the spool. Heavy drag is very important, the higher gear ratio is looking like a better choice"
761005,Pigeontroller,2013-01-20 19:48:00,2793,"Peter's in St.Catharines has a few lefty Shimano Castaic's with the Insta-ingage feature. And Fishing World in Hamilton has a few righty's, in fact on sale for $149 I think. These are discontinued so if this feature interests you move quickly.  http://www.tackledirect.com/shimano-castaic-sf-reels.html"
761006,Tayzak15,2013-01-20 19:51:00,318,"The  Shimano Chronarch. Best reel I've ever used. I also have the 350$ Abu Garcia revo mgx and I like this one much more just feels right, and extremely easy to cast a country mile. http://www.basspro.com/Shimano-Chronarch-Baitcast-Reels/product/10215337/"
761013,Luke V.,2013-01-20 20:16:00,286,"The castaic looks like a really  nice reel. However at only 9.2lbs of drag it might me a limiting factor  I have used a chronarch before. They are very nice reels, but out of my price range.(right on the edge)"
761014,MCTFisher9120,2013-01-20 20:18:00,3761,nvm core is too much moola  fast gear ratio the core 50mg7's are really nice.MTBF

761028,BillM,2013-01-20 21:18:00,17367, LOL!!!!!!!!!
761029,ah_long,2013-01-20 21:19:00,354,"definitely a higher gear ratio for flipping and pitching to pull the hawg out of the slop quick, lower gear ratios are for bigger moving baits such as cranks, swimbaits, big blades... etc  for your price brand new Shimano Chronarch E series New Abu Garcia Revo STX Daiwa T3 Ballistic  buying used would be a better option Daiwa Zillion variations except the crazy cranker Shimano Curado E7 Shimano Chronarch D7 (best choice IMO)  As for line choice, I'd look into the new Sunline FX2 and the 832, I have used both of these line as well as the power pro, FX2 would be my first choice. The rod you chose is great and although it's a middle entry level price tag, the performance is pretty good."
761033,Luke V.,2013-01-20 21:29:00,286,What do people think of the Revo SX http://abugarcia.com/products/reels/low-profile-baitcast-reels/revo/revo-sx  compared to the Okuma Serrano https://www.okumafishing.com/product/view/reels/baitcast-reels-low-profile/serrano  Compared to the Shimano Curado http://fish.shimano.com/publish/content/global_fish/en/us/index/products/reels/low_profile_baitcasting/Curado_E.html  compared to the Quantum Energy PT http://www.quantumfishing.com/products/1743/Energy-PT.aspx  Here is a chart i threw together for some easy comparison Not in any specific order 
761037,ah_long,2013-01-20 21:42:00,354,"skip the quantum and the okuma..  the SX is not a bad reel but I would go with the Shimano as a proven workhorse  http://www.tackletour.com/reviewshimanocuradog.html  the number of bearings is not as important as the location and quality of the bearings  personally for $40 difference, I'll go with the new STX...  SAIL in etobicoke is having 25% off all reels, you can score the new STX for about $150"
761046,Luke V.,2013-01-20 21:58:00,286,"Thanks for your input Ah-long.  For line, I was thinking superslick power pro. I will have a look at the sunline and the 832. Attached to blue label seaguar 25# leader I will look into the sale at Sail. Seems tempting.  Would you by chance have any used reels that would fit the bill for me?"
761050,ah_long,2013-01-20 22:11:00,354,"from your reel choices, seems like you're a righty and I'm a lefty, so I don't think I have anything that will fit your bill. I've never seen reels go for a steep discount in both fishing shows, more than often, you get a free hat or something like that. My suggestion would be to grab the rod from Vince and bring to rod to SAIL and try out the reels yourself. There are some things about reels that we can't put on paper, e.g. how it palms and how it balances with the rod of your choice.  25# leader seems to be too excessive, a 12~16# leader should be more than enough.. if you're flipping in slop and weedy areas, I would just forget the leader. Flipping and pitching is more of a power technique with a touch of finesse (how and where you place the bait), but most of the time the fish would hit on the first fall so the leader doesn't matter so much."
761051,Luke V.,2013-01-20 22:17:00,286,As far as reeling goes I can use both hands. With a caster reel I like to reel right. But with a spinning reel I reel with my left hand.  Very good idea about grabbing the rod then going from there with the reel  Last year at the sportsman show I picked up a Helios for 185 no tax. He had it on for 220. :$
761052,GBW,2013-01-20 22:24:00,8460,No I don't use one right now but I know many a bass toury guy that does.  Based on your list I would be looking at the ABU's a tad more than the Shimano's as I know the ABU's are a work horse even for musky
761053,msp,2013-01-20 22:24:00,1336,"Personally I love the Curados. Stick with the high speed ( 7:1 ) reels. Pigeontroller had a great suggestion with the Castaic. My buddy has an old one and loves it. Dont bother with a leader, its just one more point that can fail when setting the hook or hauling big bass from cover. Straight braid is the way to go. good luck with your choice"
761054,GBW,2013-01-20 22:26:00,8460,"""With a caster reel I like to reel right. But with a spinning reel I reel with my left hand.""  Funny you say that as when it comes to flipping I like to use a right hand reel but everything else it's a lefty."
761085,musky_hunter,2013-01-20 23:56:00,328,"For $150-$200 new i would look at the Gen 3 Revo STX. I prefer the light weight and drag power of the Abu's in the sub $200 price range. In fact, i just got 2 new Gen3 STX's as punching and frogging reels.  If you are looking to spend about $300 look at a T3 Ballistic or better yet a Core.  As for line...50lb FX2 or 20lb Sniper."
761087,BillM,2013-01-20 23:57:00,17367,In that price range I'd buy used and get a way better reel then anything you could buy new.
761091,Luke V.,2013-01-21 00:09:00,286,I will be keeping my eyes open in the classifieds for a used reel.  I am not afraid of buying used.  The title should have read New To Me reel advice.
