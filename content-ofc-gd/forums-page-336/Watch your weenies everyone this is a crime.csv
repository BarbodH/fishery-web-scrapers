760176,Handlebarz,2013-01-17 22:56:00,3790,Well the other day I went to the food basics store to get some bread milk ect. Well I saw red hots on sale so I grabbed two packs my son loves them (yes George I know there not the good ones but get he nukes em not BBQ)  Oh yeah my point here I just opened the pack and see I lost two wieners what is this world coming to selling packs of 10 hotdogs that's uncalled for So be warned they have figured out how to raise the price on wieners I guess it could have been worse they could have chopped the tip off all 12.
760177,Handlebarz,2013-01-17 22:57:00,3790,Sorry I'm on my phone the title should of had NF My bad
760233,Burtess,2013-01-18 01:52:00,901,"Bought a pack of Red Hots as well tonight, but mine have 12 ????  Burt"
760240,mercman,2013-01-18 02:09:00,7054,Its a travesty of justice Mike !Maybe Burt could spare one of his.
760244,jim,2013-01-18 02:30:00,124,"Food manufactures have been reducing the size of their packaging for years, so the price doesn't seem to go up.  Go and research it., Are you still getting what you paid for 5 yrs. ago?"
760248,registerfly,2013-01-18 02:46:00,198,"everything has been reduced ever so slightly with no or very little price increases. Ice cream for example now comes in strange sizes like 1.6L but you're paying for what was 2L pricing. Same with OJ, it's rampant practice in the food industries.  maybe the weeners are just trying to catch up with the deficient bag of buns..."
760252,Handlebarz,2013-01-18 02:53:00,3790,I hear you guys there my father was a sales rep for Lipton for years and we saw alot if that but it got worse in the 90's packaging stays the same size for shelf space but the quantity was reduced. This is the first time I have seen it on hotdogs unless they were 8's
760256,Whopper,2013-01-18 02:59:00,2174,Well now ...let me get this straight.....Mike was shorted in the weeny department  
760258,kemper,2013-01-18 03:01:00,2232,"In a few years, the weenies might finally catch up to the 8 pack of buns..."
760261,jedimaster,2013-01-18 03:15:00,3472,What about the cans of pop? Remember when they were the small cans? They used to go on sale for 3.99 per 24 case.... yah a whol 24 cans for 3.99 then they went to the 355ml cans and jumped in price. now the 355's are double what the 24 packs were. The other day I saw that they brought the small cans back in 12 packs for 3.99 per case of 12.
760272,irishfield,2013-01-18 03:52:00,26272,I always scratch my head... when the two packs stuck together are $5.00 and the single pack beside them is $3.49!
760295,mistaredone,2013-01-18 06:16:00,913,"The problem is beyond food, instead of shrinking quantity to increase profit the quality in everything we buy is poorer and poorer."
760300,Rich,2013-01-18 09:51:00,3927,"It was a pack size trick to get around other stores price matching and conceivably take their sales. Everyone else carries 12 packs, they sold 10 packs for their ad so every cheap bargain shopper couldnt run to walmart or superstore and price match. This happens a lot. The item has to be identical for us to price match.  Personally, i love having to tell customers who just piled two cases of hot dogs in their cart that they cant price match. I hate couponers and price matchers. People of walmart = them!!"
760304,Marc Thorpe,2013-01-18 11:07:00,621," Mike ,there goes the neighbourhood"
760307,outllaw,2013-01-18 11:59:00,1232,mike dont worry those type of weeenies are like twinkies. they can stand a nuke blast. great to catch up on your sodium intake lol.
760315,bobowski,2013-01-18 13:02:00,360,Thats weird. I bought the same red hots on sale at Basics the other day and mine had 12 in the package.
760320,ecmilley,2013-01-18 13:20:00,2163,well i thought i had died and gone to heaven when the 28 pack of beer was introduced that makes up for being short two weinnys
760325,jedimaster,2013-01-18 13:42:00,3472,I bought a 30 pack. It ended up being two 15 packs.
760340,ccmtcanada,2013-01-18 14:37:00,7971,Is it just me or are Wagon Wheels a LOT smaller?  Or maybe it was because I was a lot smaller as a kid and they just seemed bigger??
760352,Bernie,2013-01-18 15:27:00,3190,AT the end of the summer when cleaning out the cottage freezer there are always leftover buns because they don't match the weenie packs. Definite deliberate design.
760376,Rich,2013-01-18 16:48:00,3927,"Check the gram weight. 450g is a regular 12 pack. The 'sale' ones at basica were a 398g pack. It was to get around price matching, trust me. Im a manager for loblaws. The real crime is that it costs the store about $.34 per unit ... And people rush to the ""steal"" of a deal when they're 1.88 - only to find out they were gipped two weiners."
760388,Beans,2013-01-18 17:36:00,3339,"This is not new...back in the 50s and 60s in my waiter/bartending years beer was 10 cents a glass, then they increased the size of the glass and charged 15 cents, then they reduced the size of the glass, but still charged 15 cents...not sure what happened when they charged 20 cents a glass but I had to stop drinking early 70s...cripes knows what it cost for a glass of draught beer nowadays...I couldn't believe what it cost for a case of 24 cans of Old Milwackies that I bought for Roy's B-Day 10 years ago Only to find out he only drinks it from bottles...  We used it up making beer batter for fish fries..."
760414,shane,2013-01-18 18:48:00,652,And Subways 'foot-long' sub is only eleven inches!
760420,davey buoy,2013-01-18 19:10:00,5505,"Remember the Big Mac of 15 years ago?,it took two hands to hold,anyone had one recently?,and the price now."
760631,bigbuck,2013-01-19 15:34:00,2449,"PriceClub/Costco started playing games with packaging 20yrs ago. Pop came in 24 can cases. Along they come and demand 18 packs from the pop cos. We would sell a case for 4.99, they would sell the short case for 4.49 and people thought they were getting a deal. If you want to be a smart shopper, you need to know your Unit Costs. It kills me every time i see these games being played."
