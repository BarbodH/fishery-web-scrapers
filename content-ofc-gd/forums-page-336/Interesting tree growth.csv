761266,Roy,2013-01-21 19:32:00,13728,The city worker might even still be in there doing the installation of the sign.
761273,BillM,2013-01-21 19:45:00,17367,"I have a feeling someone put the sign inside the tree.   Think about how long that would take, lol."
761280,Lip-ripper,2013-01-21 19:55:00,228,I'd like to see the look on the guys face that tries to cut it down with a chainsaw--If he doesn't notice it.
761289,ch312,2013-01-21 20:17:00,1590," on the right of the tree you can see a crease which goes from the ground straight up to where the top of the sign is and then stops. i'm thinking this is the ""scar"" from growing around the post. i examined it for a good 5 minutes and would bet my boat that the sign was there before the tree.   chop it down and put it on ebay? if people have spent hundreds on an air guitar, this tree should do pretty good"
761334,HTHM,2013-01-21 22:38:00,4082,That looks to be a 20 - 25 year old Silver Maple.
761340,Locnar,2013-01-21 22:48:00,645,I'm thinking it's a good ol' Manitoba Maple. Weed tree is what it is. I've seen them grow around/through a 10ft Chainlink fence. Useless trees.
761346,chris.brock,2013-01-21 22:57:00,4053,"I've seen a tree grow around a steel post before, didn't even know the post was in there until the chainsaw hit it, that was the end of that chain  very cool picture though"
761383,spincast,2013-01-22 00:23:00,3279,little high up for the dogs to read it though isnt it?
761435,Muskieman,2013-01-22 02:08:00,2472,"It's evolution, the tree knows nobody is supposed to park there ! Is the post in there too ?  That's pretty cool !"
761438,Twocoda,2013-01-22 02:10:00,4130,lmao....that right there was clever and funny
761477,HTHM,2013-01-22 04:41:00,4082,"You are correct, the barks are similar, and the small sucker branch at the bottom of the bole is a good clue."
761549,mpt,2013-01-22 17:23:00,158,Do you count the rings or the rust to age this tree?
761598,capt_hooked,2013-01-22 20:30:00,212,NP = means No Pruning...!
