760125,capt_hooked,2013-01-17 20:04:00,212,"Ha...! good post kickingfrog...!  We actually have many satified customers who have no problems catching nice size walleyes every year (their most common complaint is too many slot size (40-60 cm fish).  For walleyes, instead of the tradional minnows / then nightcrawlers off points, I started using double twisters tails, years ago, drifting the cabbage. Then last couple years back to the points using tube baits... all with good success. It's good to mix things up..!      We actually have many satified customers who have no problems catching nice numbers of walleyes each year. Their biggest complaint is too many slot size fish.  Other customers catch good numbers of small-mouth and large-mouth bass, pike and good size muskies (average musky is often near 45 inches).  I have been more concern about the northern pike popluation over walleys the last few years... but walleyes get all the attention  Give me two walleyes and a couple or just one 20"" northern for a shore lunch and I will have some great eating and probably more than I can eat!

760129,aplumma,2013-01-17 20:18:00,6896,"Cap. thanks for chiming in. I as you know have been fishing with you all for 6 years plus. I fish for pike most of the time and rarely go for Walleye but there are some big Walleye in the weeds. I do think that it should be billed as a multi species place because of the strong catches of Bass,Muskie,Perch and Pike. The Walleye I can't speak for since to me it is a by catch species in my style of fishing.  Art"
760137,kickingfrog,2013-01-17 20:46:00,8333, Good point on the worms last year. Remember the heat wave in March? Early spring.

I wish they took it more seriously but they have nothing to lose by cutting the $$$. We as anglers need to be more vocal with mpp's as we are often portrayed as a nuicance rather than a benefit. Policy seems to be based on cost, not what's best for the fishery...."
760301,Rich,2013-01-18 10:03:00,3927,Want me to mail you some fishing licenses? They're like 30 bucks here..?
760337,doubleheader,2013-01-18 14:19:00,497,"Truth is, for many years the vast majority of serious walleye fishermen have passed on Nipissing, Personally after 3 consecutive declining years for us, each year being 2 week ""hunts"", and given that walleye are our primary target, we'll probably pass on the lake this year. First time in more than 10 years we won't be enjoying this beautiful lake, but in the end it is a fishing vacation, so we'll move to more productive water. If I were interested in bass, musky, or pike, however, the arm remains an excellent fishery. As for restocking, I find it inconceivable that stocking works so many places but won't work here. Especially if the brood stock is taken from the lake. I think what's going on is a little cat and mouse game, Your MNR not willing to invest in restocking walleye without agreements to restrict commercial fishing. One would think that at some point as the populations continue to decline the commercial fishermen will find other productive employment. No one can stay in business without a profit, and as that occurs the lake will likely rebound if efforts are in place to wipe out those cormorants. In the meantime though, I would agree, the lake should be billed as a multi-species lake."
760339,Headhunter,2013-01-18 14:34:00,5703,Maybe we should make up our own Idle No More posters and blockade the fish processing plant on Nip... since the depletion of all species in the lake due to gill netting is not conducive to mother nature's continued well being.. HH
760362,ecmilley,2013-01-18 15:48:00,2163,"Can't help but wonder how long the nets have been there and all of a sudden the fishery is suffering, If the lake cannot handle the harvest on it as it was for years then looking at other enviromental issues is a must, I am going to say that with all communities around this amazing lake growing we have a pollution issue like silting in of gravel beds, zebra/quagga mussels and water clarity change predator/prey relation ships do to water clarity, unstabe water levels these are the biggest challenges facing kawartha lakes as well"
760750,Rob Hyatt,2013-01-20 00:29:00,1,"Hello everyone.I don't post very often,but I have to throw out my 2 cents on this.Great post T.J.Q!!!I have been fishing this lake since I was a young boy and have made my living fishing for the last 25 years.I have seen many changes to this lake over the years,some good ,some not so good!I sat on the PAC committee as an ""Angler at Large(along with Kevin and many other wonderful knowledgeable people)The 2 walleye limit was the lease painful of the 37(i believe)options that were put forth by the M.N.R and some of the PAC members.I've had to answer many questions and reply to many comments about these new rules,and  most people will tell me how my business is going to suffer and then complain about the natives gill netting.My business may suffer,I don't know.I survived the limit going from 6 to 4 then the slot limit,shorter seasons,and now 4-2.Fishing success for me is not measured by getting my limit.I enjoy getting out  on the water,its an investment in yourself,its a social event.The best part of fishing for me is SETTING THE HOOK.I have never had a hook set that I didn't enjoy,and I don't care if its a pike,perch,bass,herring or walleye,everyone is awesome! As far as gill netting is concerned,everyone needs to understand that the natives will always be able to gill net Lake Nipissing.The M.N.R could close this lake for recreational fishing and the native people will still be able to gill net.Its a fact of life , and the finger pointing analegy has to stop!I can tell you that the N.F.N and Dokis First Nations are on side and have made and will continue to make positive changes to the way they fish.Having said that, we as recreciational anglers,must change our ways also.Slot sizes and limits are in place for a reason and EVERYONE should be following the rules!We will only be able to have a properous fishery if we ALL work together!I am personnally disappointed with the way the M.N.R has managed the lake over the last 15-20 years,and with shrinking budgets and less staff I really don't see things improving in the future.The Lake Nipissing Stakeholders Assoc.is trying to ramp up our Walleye Restocking efforts and the M.N.R can't even make a decision in a timely fashion to let us proceed.I had the opportunity to visit a Walleye Aquacultural Facility on Manitoulin Island this summer,they successfully are raising Walleyes from egg form to 7.5"" fish  within 6 months,bypassing the critical period for them to become food for other preditors.The M.N.R has granted us a license to take 2 million eggs a year for as long as I remember.We would like to take 6 million this year and release them at different stages throughout the spring,summer and fall.If you are interested in  what we are trying to do,please visit www.lnsa.com. This is my 2 cents for what it's worth.Happy Fishing and BASS Regards.  Rob Hyatt."
760752,TJQ,2013-01-20 00:37:00,7806,Great post Rob!  Its your winning personality that keeps your clients coming back!
760975,GreenCanada,2013-01-20 18:12:00,375," Yea, I'm pretty sure there are a lot of people in the GTA that care about fishing. Soooo, I'm not really sure where you're going with that."
760984,capt_hooked,2013-01-20 18:29:00,212,Good post Rob....  
761000,adempsey,2013-01-20 19:34:00,1498,"Personally, I would be fine with a 2 walleye possession limit.   As long as I can keep fishing, I am good."
761023,Nipfisher,2013-01-20 20:58:00,2449,Yep. My buddy caught 40 walleye and 100 perch over 3 days and only kept 2 eater walleye (under the slot) and 3 or 4 perch. He had a blast.
759501,TJQ,2013-01-15 18:54:00,7806,"So.. after digesting a bit more on the lake and talking to alot of people here.  I've had some interesting points brought to my attention, that I thought would make an interesting conversation.  I may be off base here, so please set me straight if I'm missing something.  ( Please no native bashing here.. not what this thread is about - ill just delete your comments )  #1  From everyone I talk to the halving of the limit was on the very bottom of the list of MNR options.  The MNR themselves have told stakeholders that it would not have much if ANY effect on the fishery.  So why would they do that??  #2 Alot of the tourists that come up, especially out of province ones, buy a week long conservation license and stay at a lodge or cottage resort.  So they would get to keep 2 pickeral for shore lunch, as believe it or not, most tourists are not interested in dragging much fish home.  #3 So now that the Conservation License will be 1, most people will be forced to buy a regular license if they want to have a shorelunch (2 under the slot fish each) raising the license fee from. 29.40 to 51.28.  Basically raising the $ value of licenses sold on Lake Nipissing by 40%, which goes into the general fund and will not be spent on Lake Nipissing cause the MNR is vehemently against stocking. They assure me it doesn't work. Personally I don't know that it does or doesn't, what I do know is that it cannot hurt.  And it sure as hell can't hurt tourism, which for our area is one of the biggest sources of jobs, property taxes and general taxes up here.  #4 Historically regulations that have been pushed on Nipissing first have managed to make there way across the province.  If I'm not mistaken (and I may be.. once again set me straight) we were the first to have a limit of 4, and the first to have slot sizes.  So is a walleye limit of two only a matter of time for the rest of the province??  Even if you don't fish Nipissing that alone ought to give you something to think about.  Just my thoughts...please keep the comments civil... please."
759508,Joey,2013-01-15 19:39:00,9122,"So in the end, it's all about money $$$$$$ for the Gov't and not the public or tourism, figures"

759515,Tayzak15,2013-01-15 19:56:00,318,Urgh....remember the days when the limit was 6
759604,dhickey,2013-01-15 23:20:00,1038,Something some may want to look at is .   Lake Nipissing Data Review . I found it on google and it is from the MNR.  After reading it a couple times it would seem to me that the problem is with youth mortality and the fish are growing into the slot size before they have a chance to regenorate the population.  So this would suggest to me that the fish are very heathy and have lots of food with very little competition?  So hear is somthing to ponder. What if the slot size was changed? Nothing can be kept under 50 cm? This would alow the youth to mature and spawn while not hurting tourisim.  This may be a case of MNR not wanting to admit that the slot size program didnt work?  Regardless Nipissing is in trouble.  If you alow the smaller fish to grow and spawn there will be tonns of fish it may take 6-7 years but I dont see what the alternative is?  Just my thoughts..
759606,chris.brock,2013-01-15 23:37:00,4053,"in point #3, you mention stocking couldn't hurt  there is some science that says stocking into a naturally reproducing population can hurt, it can distort the genetics if they were stocking from Lk Nip fish (I assume they would), some science argues that the stocking by-passes the natural selection process and can hurt the population  I know in Haliburton the MNR doesn't stock natural lake trout lakes with lakers even if the population is low and struggling"
759608,Kingsalmon,2013-01-15 23:38:00,107," I am almost sure that this will come to fruition in the rest of the province.  As TJ mentioned, Nipissing has always been the testing grounds for regulation changes, and I feel this time around its going to be no different.  In the next decade this whole province with have the same limits as Nipissing.  Pretty soon no one will know what a pickerel/walleye tastes like"
759610,Joeytier,2013-01-15 23:41:00,3990,"I, as well as many others, wouldn't be keeping hardly any fish that's for sure if that were the case."
759611,Cookslav,2013-01-15 23:42:00,1457,"I'm no Biologist but, I'm fairly certain the Commercial netting has a hell of a lot more to do with low fish numbers then the angling does. I can't speak for the area toursim industry as I'm not familiar with the levels of dependancy on price sensitivity vs. available fish that fit into the slot sizes and limits but I'm guessing it will have some impact. And long term if that money isn't translated into a stocking program that actually works....its not helping a thing.  So to me it just seems the decisions made are a bandaid solution. Limiting the anglers (tourist or local) and their catch numbers seems is a simple drop of water in a big puddle. The only way to get Fish numbers up IMO is to police, limit, or stop the commercial fishing, increase stocking programs and potentially look into adding some sanctuary waters... Admitedly this would also effect the local economy, but IMO its a more sustainable long term plan."
759616,dhickey,2013-01-16 00:00:00,1038,You would be catching fish... You would need to adoped catch and release practices.?

759626,LeXXington,2013-01-16 01:11:00,1928,Fishing is not something the GTA really care’s about. This is a trend that will continue as more kids grow up not experiencing the outdoors. Why the MNR did this. It was an easy way out.  Personal thoughts for fixing… A tourist fishing licence for people outside Ontario Allow local groups to stock. Fix the netting issue so all parties are happy All money collected by MNR stays in MNR
759630,Whopper,2013-01-16 01:35:00,2174,"TJ a lot of people from my area use to vist Nip back in the day, they were casual fishermen, with most the only week they fished all year. Nip at times can humble a good fisherman and a novice isn't going to spend the kind of money to go there and not catch fish let alone agree to a one fish limit, just ain't going to happen.  Paul I don't understand the ""tourist fishing license""'  now I'm not complaining but I paid almost $70 last year for my license and will do the same this year, how much more should I pay?"
759840,LeXXington,2013-01-17 00:58:00,1928, Sorry to be clear a tourist fishing license should be cheaper and the same as a sportsman.  We need to encourage other people outside of canada to come to the area.  Like you said you payed $70 last year add that to the cost of travel no wonder people are going elsewhere.  
759846,Whopper,2013-01-17 01:36:00,2174," Glad you cleared that up, actually the license fee is a bit more than we pay state to state here but I think it's worth it. I made three trips to Ontario last season and probably spent more than a casual local fishermen, but then again it's what I enjoying doing and one of the reasons I work"
759943,huntinnut,2013-01-17 12:38:00,3,"Hi all, I've been following along and thought i'd weigh in.  I work in forestry in BC, and we're constantly dealing with, and trying to find creative solutions to similar policy problems.  This is probably a bit heavy for a first post here.  I was fishing at Nippissing a week ago, and from what I could see the pikerel I caught were quite young and growing very fast.  It seems to me that any policy decisions made by the MNR, with respect to sport fishing in the context of lake Nippissing, are meaningless unless the variables affecting sustainability of the lake are all addressed together.  With the way things are now it seems that any actions taken by the MNR to improve the fishery on Nippissing will be counteracted by increased, or at least continued, commercial fishing.  There doesn't seem to be any desire on the part of the government to test the boundaries of the Sparrow case, which could result in a more regulated commercial fishery, which then could allow the lake to be managed sustainably.  This would require another court case which would take years to decide, but would possibly offer a  useful framework when deciding 'how much' of a resource can be taken.  Failing the government doing something then the best option may be one of advocacy (although it might be extremely difficult).  At this point the data i've seen shows that the commercial catch is also declining, and it would be in the best interests of those doing the fishing to reduce their catch or adopt more selective fishing practices that allowed the lake to recover, so that the catch could be done at a more sustainable level.   In BC, native groups at least partially listen to DFO recomendations regarding native cerimonial and sustinance fishing because nobody wants to see the salmon dissapear.  Maybe sport fishing groups should engage in a dialouge over the level of fishing in Nippissing for everyones benefit.  This would have to be done in a non-confrontational way so as to not become a fight over fishing or fishing rights, which this is not about.  It would simply be about the sustainable management of Nippissing.  Karl"

759969,TJQ,2013-01-17 14:27:00,7806, Thats a fact.  And thats the real problem.  Only one of the 5 or 6 things that are hurting or could help are actually being addressed in any way with real action.
759974,Fish Farmer,2013-01-17 14:56:00,2234,"I think they have to go to the root of the problem and fix it. Dropping the limit is going to hurt tourism. Spending hundreds of dollars to go to Nip and only being able to keep 2 Pickerel the size of a Perch, is not going to cut-it. It's a darn shame because I always looked forward to our yearly trip to Nip. and it doesn't happen anymore. I feel sorry what's about to happen, not good."
759975,TJQ,2013-01-17 15:00:00,7806,"Well the other thing that needs to be done is the lake has to loose its sygma as a walleye lake.  Thats what alot of tourists come from, but theres also fantastc pike small & largemouth bass fishng and more perch than can be consumed.  Ive already had clients tell me they are going to promote the place as a veritable grab bag of great multi species fishing.

760086,Lunkerhunter,2013-01-17 18:21:00,455,"every year i usually go on 3-4 week long fishing trips to many of the our wonderful lodges across ontario. i have never been and most likely will never go to nipissing for any of my trips for many of the reasons that are being discussed here.  I know the lake has an abundance of other species that are not walleye but it just seems like its getting worse and worse as a whole. i drive right by it and even fish some of its surrounding lakes with much success but i just dont see myself booking a week trip to a lodge on nippissing.  i have to agree lowering the walleye limit to 2 dink fish cannot help tourism and bringing people from out of province/country to the lake. that said a majority of the guests at the lodges i have stayed at across ontario are from the states and very few canadians actually spend money and stay at the lodges that we have right here in our province. its pretty sad really when you go on a lodges website that is based in canada and the prices are in american dollars as thats 90% of there customers.  im sure glad there are as many lakes in this country as there are. makes it easy to ""skip"" over the ones like nipissing. sorry to say it but its true  good thread TJ. should make for an interesting read  cheers"
760103,kickingfrog,2013-01-17 19:03:00,8333,"Lots of issues and factors at work on a big lake but one aspect that hasn't been mention is that general make-up of the lake has changed.  water chemistry (""cleaner"" then past decades) introduced species (Spiny water flees et al) resurgence of species (Cormorants) types of bait fish (Smelt) availability of bait fish (see above cormorants) etc  One thing that has hardly changed one bit from the 70's is the way many of the anglers try to catch the walleye on Nipissing.  Early season: Soak minnows on points and if that doesn't work soak minnows in bays. If you want to be cutting edge you use worms early.  ""Later"" in the season (second weekend after opener) soak worms on points and if that doesn't work drag crawler harnesses if there is enough wind.  And when you don't catch as many fish as you remember ""you used to catch"" blame it on: early spring, late spring, spring interrupted, minnows were too big, minnows were too small, minnows died too easily, tourist kept too many, locals kept too many and finally ""I should have been here yesterday"".  This, of course, does not apply to all but I hear this every year from people fishing walleye on Nipissing. And yes, some are family."
