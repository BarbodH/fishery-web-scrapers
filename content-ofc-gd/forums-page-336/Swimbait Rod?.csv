I am not targeting any one species as yet. The rig I am using right now is a little to light for swimbaits. I have picked out the reel I want to use for this new rig and it will be the Curado 300E. I haven’t a clue what to pick for the rod. I guess most of the time I will be using lures up to ~3 ounces. I rarely have access to a boat so fishing from the shore will be the norm. I would like to get a two piece rod as it would be easier to transport.  Any thoughts or suggestions would be greatly appreciated.  Thanks,  Bill"
421627,fish-miester,2010-01-12 21:17:00,864,"first off I'd just like to clear this up are you using ""real"" swimbaits.. or hollow belly / soft swimbaits"
421636,wellis1840,2010-01-12 21:37:00,18,"I plan to use ""real"" hard plastic and wooden swimbaits.  Now, what two piece rod would you recommend?  Cheers,  Bill"
421861,mbac31,2010-01-13 14:56:00,904,"Hey Ellis, I will send you a PM after on that Swimbait setup. You may want to rethink that reel. Not really a great swimbait reel. Great reel but hard on the wrists afterthrowing them al day. You need the proper rod/reel setup if not you will abandon the technique very quickly. I'm 270 lbs and if fishing the wrong  combo i even wind up having a terrible pain in the shoulder and neck. Give me some idea on what you are deciding to fish, suck as TT baits, Matts, Castaic, etc."
421962,wellis1840,2010-01-13 18:27:00,18,"G'day ""smalliefisher""  Thanks for replying.  Right now I am just thinking of bass and pike.  Might try for muskie if given the chance.  What set up would you recommend.  Cheers,  Bill"
422202,Dabluz,2010-01-14 06:07:00,701,"Well....first off....I wouldn't target bass and then muskie with the same rod and reel.  You usually don't want to use a fast action rod for crank baits.  You want a little bit more ""give"" so the hooks don't rip out of the fish's mouth.  I have always loved very fast action rods but I have to admit that the slightly slower action has improved the number of fish captured.  Since you will be fishing from shore, how about an 8 foot rod.  I use a Berkley Series One (salmon-steelhead) rod for cranking from shore.  Use one of those Shimano Citica 200E.  I don't have the budget for one so I use a  Procaster Z H103 or a Procaster X H103."
