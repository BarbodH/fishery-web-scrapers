761612,bowj,2013-01-22 21:01:00,8,any idea what the ice is like now?  with thise cold snap I was hoping to try Puslinch or Little this weeekend. any tips appreciated.
761613,Rich,2013-01-22 21:03:00,3927,I think they'll both be alright by the weekend. Be aware of puslinch though its bigger so wind may be a factor in unsafe ice.
