760390,NAW,2013-01-18 17:54:00,4022,"I am in the process of converting my homemade portable in to a solid walled hut.  It is 4 x 8 base, 7' tall in the center.  Barn still roof.  I have the walls and roof up.  Purchased all of my sealants, and paint.  Gunna get that part done this weekend.  Next step is to install some insulation.  Anyone have any opinions for insulating a hut on a budget?  The best I can find right now are the 0.5"" blue foam sheets you can get from Rona.  I need 12 @ $7 each.  $84 plus tax.  I also thought about spray foam.  Something like Froth-Pak.  But I think you need some special gas tanks, or something along those lines.  Then if you need to replace a board in the future, you have to re-foam...  I would like to install the blue foam boards.  But I am already over budget.  Anyone know a place where I can get them for dirt cheap?  or have any better ideas on how to insulate on a budget?"
760393,NAW,2013-01-18 18:02:00,4022,"I work for a manufacturing company.  But all of our stuff usually comes with custom formed foam packaging.  Or other stuff i can't use.  I did manage to score a sheet and a half of Pink 1"" think foam board.  But I would prefer the thin 0.5"" stuff over 1"".  And pink...  No way."

760412,davey buoy,2013-01-18 18:43:00,5505,Very nice offer!!
760417,NAW,2013-01-18 18:57:00,4022,"Wow.  That's a great offer!  I will consider that for sure!  2"" is much thicker then what I am looking for.  But as a back up, that would work OK.  The white stuff tends to flake away into those little styrafoam balls.  I was hoping to get the foam typle panel, because they are more durable.  Thanks very much eh!  I will PM you if I can't find anything in the next few weeks,"
