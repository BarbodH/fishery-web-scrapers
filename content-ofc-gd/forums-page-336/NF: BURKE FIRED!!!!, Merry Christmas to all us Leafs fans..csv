761481,Cudz,2013-01-22 05:22:00,2652,Lol! I guess when the GM of the Leafs has a baby with a local sportscaster you no longer are allowed to be GM of the Leafs.

761622,Cudz,2013-01-22 21:32:00,2652,I got an email about this over a week ago.  I was in a wedding party with Hazel about 15 years ago. Lol.  Interesting
757886,Guest,2013-01-09 20:04:00,0,Thank god.  If Burke never came to Toronto they would be in the same position Edmonton is in.  Low draft choices and a possible cup contender in a few years.  Suck it Burke
757887,davey buoy,2013-01-09 20:07:00,5505,"I think nobody really expected a stanley cup,but at least a contender in the last couple of years would of been nice."
757888,moxie,2013-01-09 20:10:00,1566,This is just another example of how absolute a joke the whole organization is. Round and round it goes and where the bottom is no one really knows. Have fun Leaf fans. LMAO!!!!!!!!!!
757892,blaque,2013-01-09 20:44:00,2419,"Nobody ever buys that, everyone in that meeting knows what your doing lmao"

I crack me up!!!!!!         Note to self ; I'd best refrain from anymore responses to this thread for fear disgruntled Leaf Fans converging on my front lawn brandishing pitch forks while chanting feverishly for my head. At least it will give them something meaningful to chant for."
757900,jedimaster,2013-01-09 21:37:00,3472,Sens Suck!!!  oh how I missed hockey talk.  I can hardly wait to see the sens fall on there faces again.
757925,creekman,2013-01-09 23:01:00,18,Ottawa is one team you canlove to hate  Fans are only there when they win
758170,kickingfrog,2013-01-10 22:09:00,8333," No doubt BB has a style that would not sit well with some/many, but that style hasn't changes since the new owners took over in August. Only a fool would not know what type of personality BB had beforehand.  I can see both sides of the fire him/keep him argument, in particular for a new ownership group, but to fire him now looks like a gong show."
758193,wildeye rainbow,2013-01-10 23:30:00,123,"I'm glad that I can still remember the Leaf's last cup - the last year of the original 6 league.  hmmm,..., let's go back to 6 teams.  who now is going to lead the Leafs to the promised land - Burkie was a dud."
758196,jedimaster,2013-01-10 23:40:00,3472,Hopefully its a player leading the team and not a GM.
758378,Oggie,2013-01-11 18:02:00,588,"Burke is an embarassment as a spokesperson for an NHL team. Rogers and Bell won't put up with his huge ego and his lack of polish. I couldn't stand watching him spit into that cup everytime they panned the Team press box. Embarrassing that a spokesperson for the leafs is caught on camera with DIP!  I liked and bought into his idea of building the team with draft picks. ""You don't trade away your future"". Yeah right then he dumps three major picks for Kessel!  Totally inconsistent and he lost all credibility with me.  Let's trade Kessel and get the albatrose off of his neck. Let the kid go some where so he isn't haunted by a trade for which he has no responsibilty.  I am absolutely sick of watching a Canadian team with so many Americans on the team.  The NCAA doesn't play an NHL style. They don't play enough games to make them capable of playing an NHL style hockey.  Burke totally dismissed the OHL, WHL and QHL because he was intent on drafting Americans. Let's draft players with some grit!!!  Dan O."
758383,jedimaster,2013-01-11 18:10:00,3472,I think Burke is going to eventually take over the coach's corner spot when Cherry retires.  This firing sets him up for that.
758393,davey buoy,2013-01-11 18:42:00,5505,That's another issue with him I forgot about!
758398,Oggie,2013-01-11 18:54:00,588,"Boy I'd love to be in the hall when those two pass each other as they hand off the ""batton"". UFC would look like a picnic!   I wonder how much Cherry's dislike of Burke and Wilson had to do with their ultimate firing. Dan O."
758406,glen,2013-01-11 19:11:00,2641,"""I wonder how much Cherry's dislike of Burke and Wilson had to do with their ultimate firing.""  Cherry not liking Burke should tell you something.  He didnt manage the player we had very well."
758446,sturgman,2013-01-11 21:03:00,249,"Just wondering, if burkie was the former gm and president of the club, and nonis is hired as the g.m and senior vice president. Who is the president of the leafs?"
758451,kickingfrog,2013-01-11 21:14:00,8333," The three headed monster that is now the board didn't like BB's title. Poof, you're fired. Now we can expect all trades to be vetted by Larry, Bell and Rogers. AKA the three stooges."
758475,lookinforwalleye,2013-01-11 23:28:00,4399,Rob your always welcome to come over to the dark side because as you know my team has run so perfectly the last 20 years!!!! Lol
758488,kickingfrog,2013-01-12 00:25:00,8333,If that were ever to be considered the bigger concern would have to be the imminent and horrible end of the earth.
758514,Oggie,2013-01-12 02:26:00,588,American players obviously should be a part of the team as should Europeans but I don't believe either should make up most of any team. When the going gets tough they aren't going to lead the charge to the net.  It's what they do in the playoffs that count not the regular season which is mostly non-body contact (except for this year).  Burke had blinders on. He spend too much time scouting the NCAA to the exclusion of Canadian Juniors.  Dan O.
758516,mr blizzard,2013-01-12 02:30:00,1589,Thats why I watch the CFL. Its growing in popularity.
758518,Guest,2013-01-12 02:33:00,0,"With the Olympics coming next year im putting my money on the Americans taking it.  I know im Canadian, but my gut says Quick is going to steal the show."
758633,kickingfrog,2013-01-12 16:58:00,8333,BB conference starting in a few. Since he's still getting paid by the team not much might be said publicly by him.
758636,davey buoy,2013-01-12 17:15:00,5505,Any idea what channel?
757819,lhousesoccer,2013-01-09 17:34:00,442,"CBC News Alerts  Wednesday, January 09, 2013  Leafs president and GM Brian Burke fired: media reports  For the latest on this breaking story, visit http://links.cbc.ca/a/l.x?t=jncickfnnncpgkdohdeell&M=1&v=4  Edited:  Some Other LInks  http://aol.sportingnews.com/nhl/story/2013-01-09/brian-burke-fired-maple-leafs-roberto-luongo-trade-rumors  http://blogs.thescore.com/nhl/2013/01/09/brian-burke-has-been-fired-from-his-position-as-leafs-general-manager/?utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=Feed%3A+HousesOfTheHockey+(Houses+of+the+Hockey+(Blog))"

757824,anders,2013-01-09 17:42:00,1168,"I think its good timing.  Management are probably worried about the trade rumours regarding Luongo, and are stopping any damage being done.  Proactive, rather than reactive.  Can Toronto really afford him in trade?  Alex Anthopolous is rumoured to have the upper hand as his replacement"
757827,Jds63,2013-01-09 17:52:00,1365,finally ... its about time ... 4 years at the helm and nothing to show
757828,Headhunter,2013-01-09 17:59:00,5703,Rumours on TV state they they think they will replace within the organization... Carlton the Bear has the same playoff record with the Leafs as Burkey... food for thought! HH
757836,glen,2013-01-09 18:28:00,2641,I like that.  Can Bettman get the boot now too
757837,davey buoy,2013-01-09 18:35:00,5505,"After two years and he said he wasn't going to give away the farm?,What farm? Giver I say,but four years,sorry Brian.They are barely different than when he began IMO."
757838,jedimaster,2013-01-09 18:40:00,3472,Wow. Thats crazy. I am really mixed on this. I think Burke really dropped the ball a few times by not doing offer sheets and signing the big contracts to try and lure Richards etc.. I think that was a big time mistake. I do like a few of the deals he did make though.
757840,jedimaster,2013-01-09 18:42:00,3472,And btw tsn is reporting Nonis was named GM... not sure if its interim though.
757842,jedimaster,2013-01-09 18:43:00,3472,"Actually they are completly different in terms of personel but the same results with the same flaws, Weak defense, no goaltend solution, no top line center. That is why he has been fired. a complete overhaul and still the same flaws."
757843,davey buoy,2013-01-09 18:47:00,5505,Same thing is what I was saying.Outcome the same in different words  .
757845,Squid,2013-01-09 18:50:00,1656,I hear the waffle guys are in the running for the post
757849,lhousesoccer,2013-01-09 18:53:00,442,David Norris it is.
757850,glen,2013-01-09 18:55:00,2641,He didn't manage the players he had.
757851,jedimaster,2013-01-09 18:59:00,3472,"So the next question, Does Nonis have the stones to go and scoop up Luongo and throw a sheet a Suban... and who does he buy out?"
757853,davey buoy,2013-01-09 19:02:00,5505,"I don't know if that is true?,wouldn't surprise me,typical leafs. Don't spend any more than you have to."
757855,davey buoy,2013-01-09 19:04:00,5505,Any change imo would be good. Something to look forward too.
757857,jedimaster,2013-01-09 19:12:00,3472,They can't get worse by losing a pair of guys and opening some space.  Nonis is on TSN now and looks totally stunned like a deer in the headlights... http://www.tsn.ca/live/player.aspx#v=835987&i=835987
757860,tb4me,2013-01-09 19:17:00,3295,"Im shocked at the timing of this move.Brian was a great future builder. The Marlies have had a unreal run in the AHL and we have players all over the CHL and OHL including the ECHL. The people that say he has done nothing, and we have no future..I guess there is just no pleasing some people..The future is very bright and im impressed with his work done here. Thank-you Mr. Brian Burke."
757862,jedimaster,2013-01-09 19:20:00,3472,"The timing is insane imo. a week before they drop the puck? Clearly some big deals can be made in the next couple weeks and I think this is going to be a huge setback towards making some deals. They said they have been thinking about this for months, Why not just do it months ago and give nonis a running start."
757866,davey buoy,2013-01-09 19:25:00,5505,"I obviously don't agree.The future may look nice in the ""minors"",but 3 plus years imo has not shown the city he is out to make a true stanley cup contender.In the future sure,But he had long enough to put a contender on the ice. Again IMO."
757868,davey buoy,2013-01-09 19:26:00,5505,Your watching the same channel as I am lol.
757877,Headhunter,2013-01-09 19:42:00,5703,"Reading between the lines from what Amseli (sp) said, it seems to me that new ownership did not like Burkes style of leadership. His gruff style, shooting from the hip is not what corporations want in their leadership. Nonis is preceived as being more ""professional"". That was my take on it. HH"
757879,davey buoy,2013-01-09 19:50:00,5505,Been hearing that as well.
757881,jedimaster,2013-01-09 19:51:00,3472,"Thats my take too. Bell and Rogers don't like burke. But still why today, seems so stupid to me."
