For the last couple weekends my wife has been off doing things with her sister so I've had a free fishing pass.  So of course the weather last week had to jump to 15 or whatever and melt all the ice on Simcoe  . I thought it was going to be the same for today but checking around it looked like things had solidified pretty well up to this morning so I threw the clam in the truck and headed out to get some fresh air.  Man it felt nice to be on the ice again. The ice was fine when I went out, 4 to 5 inches once you got past the broken up stuff at shore but I gotta say coming off at 1pm there was a lot of water on top and I'm glad I didn't stick around longer.  Anyhow, there was lots of guys out though no one using sleds or atvs which was good to see.  The bite was great for the first couple hours (I got on the ice around 8:30) but really died off around 11 or so. Mostly dinks but luckily I managed enough for tonights dinner.  Of course being the first trip of the year I forgot to bring a bucket/minnow pail so I just went artificials today. Typical mix of dinks to keepers - probably 10 to 1 or so with one really nice girl. Pretty much all came on a perch pattern jigging rap (see the pic below).  Great to get out, weather looks like it should lock everything up this week so hopefully there's a few more trips to be made - really looking forward to the Tyler event again this year and going after some whities.  Here's some pics from the phone - have a great weekend everyone.  "
