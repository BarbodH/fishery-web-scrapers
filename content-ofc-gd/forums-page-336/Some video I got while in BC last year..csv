GoPro was only used for 2 days out of the entire trip, but got quite a bit of footage. I'll work on uploading the rest later.  Note: audio is very low due to sealed waterproof case, but there is some swearing.  "

761469,MJL,2013-01-22 04:17:00,2427,You should've tested how waterproof the GoPro was without the housing  Definitely the most awesome trip I've ever been on. A couple days ago I watched a few of the vids we took and realized that a good portion of them were of us losing fish.LOL
