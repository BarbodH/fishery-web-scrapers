761553,Pangle,2013-01-22 17:50:00,64,"Got out perching for the first time....ever......last saturday.  We found 7-8"" of solid black ice.  Lots of people out with sleds and four wheelers.  At the first spot we used a large spoon to attact some fish.  Managed a few good eaters with lots of dinks.  After a couple hrs my buddy goes for a trek and finds his friend about 200 yds away and comes back with a huge jumbo and asks if I want to move spots......Lets go I say. We quickly tear down, and set up in the new location.  For the rest of the day it was ON! It was so much fun watching the jumbo's cruise in and eat the bait!  Between four of us we managed a few dozen HUGE perch plus a bonus pike (tons of dinks to weed through).  The pike was caught by accident as my friend unhooked a dink perch and tossed his spoon back down the hole.  As the bait dangles about 1ft under the ice, the pike smashes the spoon. Anyhow my PB perch was 12.5"".......Good times and very good eats!      My best bait was a small green buckshot spoon tipped with a 2-3"" minnow.  I pretty much used this all day. Thanks for reading."
