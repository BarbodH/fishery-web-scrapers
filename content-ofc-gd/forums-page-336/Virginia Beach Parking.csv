761083,Fish Farmer,2013-01-20 23:55:00,2234,"Go to PB, free parking at the soccer field. VB a truck went through."
761090,nancur373,2013-01-21 00:07:00,1211,might just be PB for us
761184,Court R,2013-01-21 13:42:00,213,"Parked at VB yesterday on the road and no ticket, if everyone parks as far over on the right and if no one complains you should be fine, there is no parking anymore at the end where it was 8 bucks or so, some jackass parked on the ice and his truck went through thats not a good plan yet, oh and the fishing was good for dinks 200-300 between 3 of us with only a handful of jumbo's."
