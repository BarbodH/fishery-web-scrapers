761125,Walleye Guy,2013-01-21 02:24:00,3,"I live in peterborough ont, I'm a family man. I joined this site to meet new friends, swap some tips and too possibly meet some new fishing buddy's. I enjoy fishing for all species of fish. I fish rainbows, salmon, walleye, musky and Panfish. and so on! My wife says that I have 366 calender days in my year because I always manage to find that extra day to fish!! Lol.   I also flyfish, and tye my own flies, not an expert by no means but I enjoy it.  I own my own boat so I fish big water, but still enjoy the shore fishing as well.!!  Thanks for taking the time in reading my post.   Dwayne."
