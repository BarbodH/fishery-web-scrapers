759836,phatpelkey,2013-01-17 00:45:00,78,"im looking into buying a shimano tranx used from a friend, ratio 4.6.1 and the reel is mint, my only thing is what do you all think the reel is worth used?(but mint shape)  i want to make sure i am making the rigth deal here!!  thanks in advance"
759841,kickingfrog,2013-01-17 01:00:00,8333,Well new ones are over $500 before taxes. And I don't think they've been out for a year yet so I don't know if there is much of an established used market at this point. Personally I'm not sure if this would be the right reel if you don't already have a couple of other solid musky reels.
759853,mistaredone,2013-01-17 01:50:00,913,I'd pay $275 all day. Why is your buddy selling?  I thought when the tranx first came out it was going to be a staple for Muskie fishing.
759857,phatpelkey,2013-01-17 02:04:00,78,i currently dont have a musky reel and he is selling cause he wants the money for other fishing tackle
759884,SlowPoke,2013-01-17 03:35:00,2984,"I think to be fair, you're looking $$350-$400 I've never used the tranx but I've held it and played around with it. There's nothing wrong with it but I think I'd be happier with my 1st Gen Curado 300 (silver) for much less money. The Toro Winch is a nice reel too.  If you have your heart set on a SERIOUS reel like the Tranx, keep an eye out for a Trinidad. They've been around a while, they're bullet proof and a little cheaper."
759907,Nipfisher,2013-01-17 04:56:00,2449,I have used a Tranx this fall and LOVED it. It only comes in right hand from what I understand. It is a beautiful reel and is $600 (after taxes) so I think if you got it used for $400 - $425 it would be a great deal.
759946,Rich,2013-01-17 12:52:00,3927,Your buddy must have a lot of extra money to blow if he bought a tranx for one season! Low ball him with $275 !!
760439,phatpelkey,2013-01-18 20:40:00,78,"i ended up buying the tranx this morning, man i cant wait for the season to start lol"
760460,Pigeontroller,2013-01-18 21:58:00,2793,I think its only fair that you tell us what you paid?
760463,kickingfrog,2013-01-18 22:04:00,8333,That reel will likely last longer then most of us.
760573,phatpelkey,2013-01-19 04:06:00,78,"it was a part trade part cash deal, so no real dollar amount can be had"
760607,buick14,2013-01-19 13:35:00,741,"$400 from buddy, up to $435 used mint in box fair"
760613,MCTFisher9120,2013-01-19 14:01:00,3761,"Nice buy, was going to say $350/$400 used. We sell them for 495 so yes very expensive"
760666,T Dot,2013-01-19 17:58:00,18,sounds like a great deal!
