It was -15'C when I arrived at Casey's, Clear skies and zero wind  The access to the Lake was good a little rough but no slush or water. The area that was broken/busted up ice has been smoothed out with the warm temps and rain.  I drilled holes in 3 spots and all were 6-7""  The water today was not very clear and you could only see down about 8' So I ended up catching a lot of dinks but there were plenty of quality fish mixed in. The Pan Slammer on a drop shot, the Slab Grabber, and the Buckshot Forage Minnow put the bigger fish on the Ice.   I am trying to figure out how to load some pics.  I see in PB my pics are 4000w X 3000H  What size should I make them to upload?  Until then!!  Have Fun See Ya on the Hard Stuff  Rick"

760717,Spiel,2013-01-19 21:46:00,9065,Good stuff Rick.  I'm itching to get up there but given that I have limited opportunities I'm going to wait for safe ice over deep water.
