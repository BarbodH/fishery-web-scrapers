I managed only one little Splake about 7"" which barely saw the light of day before being reunited with it's year class..  Didi manage several hits and the megadump of snow made for some interesting driving .... next time ... I am thinking Widgeon or perhaps Emsdale ... any tips from my Burks Falls/Sundridge/South River brethren ?"
760826,Jet,2013-01-20 03:17:00,364,I recently drove 7 hours for Steelhead and spent 3 days on the river only to come home with a skunk  At least you got something!  Hopefully Rosseau will freeze up for you soon!
760999,camillj,2013-01-20 19:30:00,1988,Oh .. Rosseau is frozen (at least where I go)... about 6 inches of decent ice down towards Port Carling.  Was on my spot for about 3 minutes before Icing the season's first laker (a nice 3 pounder) ... didnt bother with the pics (derby doesnt start for another week or so
