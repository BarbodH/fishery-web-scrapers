761117,hotsky,2013-01-21 01:59:00,400,I'm looking to rent a cottage for a weekend in May or June for 4 people. I friend of mine suggested Honey Harbour. I've never fished or been there or anywhere on Geordan bay. I like the idea because it's reletively close to Hamilton but I supposed it can any anywhere else with in same distance. The cottage would have to be private and include a boat. Can anyone suggest a cottage/location?

761296,captpierre,2013-01-21 20:38:00,2521,Might be tough to find a private rental with a boat.  Too much at stake for the owner.  Better to rent/insure from a marina
