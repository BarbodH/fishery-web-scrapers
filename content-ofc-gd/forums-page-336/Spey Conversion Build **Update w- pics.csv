760707,kemper,2013-01-19 21:11:00,2232,"That's exactly how I would do it, I saw a thread about that rod somewhere when it was built"
760724,jim,2013-01-19 22:14:00,124,I'm kinda rustic.  Got old wood too!!
760860,jace,2013-01-20 08:30:00,472,"you can also measure the butt diameter for a gimbal cover, the type made for covering aluminum gimbals on saltwater stand-up rods.  Basic vinyl and pvc covers are usually $1-3. "
761462,MJL,2013-01-22 03:52:00,2427,It turned out great Brady  I'll definitely have to give the 6wt Rainshadow blank a good look over. I'd like a light spey rod for medium sized rivers with a bit of pace.
761496,Spiel,2013-01-22 13:10:00,9065," Agreed, nicely done Sir."
761521,kemper,2013-01-22 14:51:00,2232," Thanks Mike  It's an awesome rod built as intended as well, I've fished it on water as big as the saugeen and as small as the credit, and didn't find it out of place in either scenario. Chucks all but the heaviest iron, unless you feel the need to fish 5 inch weighted intruders you'll be fine..."
761524,kemper,2013-01-22 15:09:00,2232,Here's the same blank in it's spey clothes Mike...        
761525,kemper,2013-01-22 15:09:00,2232, Thanks Chris
761528,TJQ,2013-01-22 15:58:00,7806,Wow... nice work.

753233,kemper,2012-12-19 18:32:00,2232,"Update At bottom of page 1.  I recently built a 6wt spey rod on a Batson blank, and its been an absolutely pleasure to fish with. Light, crisp, powerful enough for small/medium size flows.  This got me thinking - it would make an awesome conversion for smaller water.  So, I give you the Batson IF1266-4 spey conversion. For this one I turned all the wood myself, and I'm really diggin' the walnut against the burgundy blank.  Length - 12'6"" (4 piece) Weight - 4.03oz (blank)  Nothing is glued up yet, that will happen this afternoon.     Cheers, Kemper"

753435,GBW,2012-12-20 18:30:00,8460,it looks great AND I like the look of the table its on too.

753509,Christopheraaron,2012-12-20 23:46:00,3525," Agreed, very nice piece."
753511,GBW,2012-12-20 23:50:00,8460,"just don't say you like old wood as there are too many jokes that can happen there.  Me, I just like old rustic furniture."
753512,Christopheraaron,2012-12-20 23:52:00,3525, LOL. How many can you think of? Cause I'm just getting one.
753513,GBW,2012-12-20 23:54:00,8460,no comment and let's not derail this post...
753554,kemper,2012-12-21 03:30:00,2232," If you guys would stop talking about my wood for a minute we could talk about my rod... Wait, that's no better.."
753571,solopaddler,2012-12-21 10:39:00,8605,Nice job Brady!! Are you willing to pick up the slack when Spiel gets swamped?
753621,kemper,2012-12-21 15:34:00,2232," Of course Mike, assuming you don't want a 7 colour chevron wrap that would take me 14 years to create..."
760528,kemper,2013-01-19 01:23:00,2232,"Update on the build:  Rod is going for a final thin coat of flexcoat this evening, and it will be ready to fish.  Still debating whether to add some rubberized cork to the butt cap - I like the all wood look but it makes it somewhat impractical for leaning the rod up against a tree etc. Don't want to wreck the wood...  Some pictures:                  Can't wait to put a bend in it!"
760529,kemper,2013-01-19 01:25:00,2232,"Apologies for the focus issues, I was using my sister's DSLR and I don't have the first idea how to make it work."
760533,MCTFisher9120,2013-01-19 01:29:00,3761,Very nice build
760576,kemper,2013-01-19 04:13:00,2232,Thanks Mike
760635,esoxansteel,2013-01-19 16:13:00,1307,"Save the wood add some rubberized cork to the cap Brady, just addded 2.50 oz of lead to the ass end of my 13.6 RV9 was a little tip heavy, but not now, very nice build by the way."
760641,kemper,2013-01-19 16:49:00,2232," I think that's probably what I'm going to do. I had to counter weight this build a touch as well, the Spey blank is a little front end heavy."
760690,Canuck2fan,2013-01-19 19:08:00,1444,Incredible looking rod. Can't wait to see the fish it gets you.
760692,bare foot wader,2013-01-19 19:18:00,1354," Spiel built my last float rod for me, I asked him to include a BPS weight kit, turned out very nicely...the brass adds a nice touch  the butt cap is removable and you adjust how many weights you want for your preference, ie changing reels or I prefer my rod tip to balance lower when I'm in a drift boat vs wading  http://www.basspro.com/Bass-Pro-Shops-XPS-Weight-Balance-Kits/product/15083/  "
