761064,TJQ,2013-01-20 23:03:00,7806,"OK.. so I've been spending a bunch of time putting stuff together for my new store launch (sometimes in the next couple of weeks)  I'm concentrating on ice fishing stuff to start, so here is my question...  Where would you put the treble hook.. with the eyes up or down???  LOL  "
761072,paul_614,2013-01-20 23:25:00,168,"my experiance shows prey taking bait head first, thinking that it so that dorsal fins don't jab them. smaller trebles at the eyes might be the ticket"
761073,BillM,2013-01-20 23:26:00,17367,Eyes down.
761078,irishfield,2013-01-20 23:36:00,26272,Eye's down.. and man that's a big treble hook...
761081,mr blizzard,2013-01-20 23:52:00,1589,
761089,TJQ,2013-01-21 00:01:00,7806,im hearing smaller treble as well??
761092,kickingfrog,2013-01-21 00:10:00,8333,"Eye's up, or you won't even catch a cold.  The only reason we are used to smaller hooks is because they are cheaper so the lure company saves money... Oh? Er, um, I guess that's you, Go ahead and make them smaller then.   Seriously though, the eyes matter more to the fisherman. Either way about half the people will tell you: ""You put the eyes on the wrong end"". You best line is to say: ""No, the hook was put on the wrong end."""
761098,TJQ,2013-01-21 00:29:00,7806, ah  as always words of wisdom... ... thanks .. now I gotta buy a bunch of tad small er trebles..
761099,Fisherman,2013-01-21 00:30:00,7201,What happens if the fish is coming from the other direction...
761103,TJQ,2013-01-21 00:36:00,7806,"Maybe I could market them as having ""Oversized hooks.. so bigger fish will bite!"""
761112,DRIFTER_016,2013-01-21 01:24:00,10439,"  Extra Strong, Arctic Tested and Big Fish Approved!!!"
761116,kickingfrog,2013-01-21 01:33:00,8333,â€¦ and extra $$$.
761123,Leecher,2013-01-21 02:21:00,7832,Paint over the eyes and you won't have to decide which end to put the hooks
761124,anders,2013-01-21 02:23:00,1168,I alway preferred eyes up...found that even when using only a minnow if the bite was light the fish would always be taking the tail part of my minnow.  I like the bigger trebles as well.
761134,TJQ,2013-01-21 03:05:00,7806,Maybe bigger trebles would be good... who wants to test them??
761137,Roy,2013-01-21 03:17:00,13728,"Do you really think it matters? How many times have you read here and everywhere else, "" I always buy such and such lures, they're a little pricey at $21.95 + tax and I always swap out the 3 trebles on all my new baits because I prefer brand X hooks in a different size."" It doesn't matter. Everyone has their own 'secret"" recipe for lure modifications. IMHO"
761147,anders,2013-01-21 03:34:00,1168,I know exactly what fish i would use them for!
761150,John Bacon,2013-01-21 03:40:00,3277, I would be happy to test them  p.s. eyes down with the treble on top
761165,mike rousseau,2013-01-21 08:01:00,4661,When I minnow fish most fish seem to hit the tail of the minnow tho... Not head first... Then turn the bait before swallowing it... So me personally... I like eyes up because thats what experience has shown me... When fish are biting like crazy  it probably doesn't matter...  Nice jigs by the way....
761471,Uncle Buck,2013-01-22 04:21:00,1000,Eyes down as you're dropping the jig Eyes up as it's going up...  as usual i have nothing useful to add... LOL  i've never paid attention to this to tell you the truth
761520,TJQ,2013-01-22 14:49:00,7806,"LOL.. Thanks guys... I ordered in a slightly smaller treble,"
