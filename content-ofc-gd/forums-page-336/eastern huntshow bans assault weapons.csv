761512,doubleheader,2013-01-22 14:35:00,497,"The nature of man hasn't changed. This issue is being highlited by a morally bankrupt governement and elitist types looking to place blame on the shoulders of law abiding gun owners. Why? They truly believe they are superior human beings, while we average Americans are nothing but country pumpkins, nothing but a revenue source. The fact that collectively we represent the largest standing army in the world is is a very real barrier to them furthering their agenda. Two they are completely inneffectual at understanding and dealing with the real root causes of violence in our society, and in fact many of these heretics profit from the culture of violence our children are bombarded with on a daily basis in the form or music, movies, romanticized gang culture, and video games, It's a far better soundbite to just blame ""assault weapons"" and it serves their purpose. The truth is, what we're seing today is a pretty good analogy as to what occurred in this country while under the thumb of England, the main difference being the government is taxing future generations visa vie out of control deficit spending and quantum easing vs levying unbearable taxes upon the current generation which they know would get them thrown out of office. So no, there can be no ""bargaining"" with these misquided nincumpoops, they are only demonstrating the wisdom of the founding fathers."

One side of this debate is advocating banning certain types of weapons (the other is taking and absolutist, hardline stance that argues the red herring of elite liberals taking the first steps in taking away all the guns. Art said above about this is a 'gray issue' that will not require black and white solutions...Well, only side is talking in black and white terms here, and that is the side saying 'Outta my cold dead hands...' Sinclair, you're repeated talk about fully automatic is just another red herring, and a favorite of the NRA types. No one here is talking about fully auto assault weapons. Try to follow along."

761526,TJQ,2013-01-22 15:14:00,7806,"I've always run my ""family"": with the same question.  ""Does that seem reasonable to you??""   I own a good 15 rifles for hunting.  I love guns and I love hunting.  Does it seem reasonable for me to own a gun that's specifically made for war?? Not to me.  Would it be cool to have one.. sure, is it reasonable.. no.  Not in Canada.. I can drop a deer on the run (lol at least I used to...)  with my hunting rifle, so anyone that needs a m-16 type rifle, really just needs more practice..lol.  Our US friends in my opinion are a different matter altogether.  We hear the stats that there are more guns in the US than citizens, so its easy for us to judge that they should be more like us, when clearly the situation is very different.  I don't know what the solution's are, but Im pretty sure its not MORE guns.  There is a huge US subculture out there that's VERY paranoid about the government taking away their rights and them not being able to defend themselves.  In Canada were are very lucky, we can sweep one government out and another in in a landslide in about 6 weeks. Happens all the time.. and i mean landslides sometimes.  Their system is not set up to do that (I'm not saying our system is any better)  The number of guns already available makes the whole situation difficult.  BUT there's no point in not trying.. Under the republicans there already was a ban on the sales of these firearms.  Anyway BACK to the topic of this thread...  The show is a private event so Kudos to the organizers for taking a stand against something they obviously do not believe in and kudos to the vendors who disagree and will not attend.  Just like this board, you can CHOOSE not to be a part of the community if it doesn't fill your needs.  And arguing about it...  well, if your arguing with someone whose mind you will never change, you're just yelling."
761527,nlpaintballer,2013-01-22 15:18:00,122,"As the OP keeps pointing out, this isn't about assault weapons, it's about customization.  If i put a pistol grip on my shotgun, it's an assault weapon. I'm teaching my kid to shoot so I put a collapible stock on my .22 so he can adjust where the butt sits and all of a sudden that .22 is an assault weapon.  Come on, any semi-intelligent person knows the action makes the firearm, not the accessories.  On a side note I wonder how many people still hunt, or own, Enfields or M-1 Garands, battle rifles desinged with a specific purpose in mind, killing people. The Garand is even semi-auto and would do a lot more damage with it's larger calibre, but since it doesn't have a collapsibe stock or pistol grip, and isn't black polymer, I guess it's not dangerous."

761542,ch312,2013-01-22 17:06:00,1590," i'm someone who poses ZERO risk to the public, yet i'm considered and treated as a criminal (yes, in canada, you're technically a criminal) and am constantly defending my right to own and shoot firearms. what these people that know NOTHING about firearms don't understand is that making thing's harder for law abiding citizens does absolutely NOTHING to lower firearm's related crimes. something bad happens somewhere and these people somehow think that banning law abiding citizens from owning a certain firearm is somehow going to make the world a better place. a criminal is going to get a gun if he wants one whether the anti gun folks think so or not.  i'd say alcohol causes far more heartache than firearms. go annoy drinkers instead of shooters for a change   NO!!!!!! it is a SEMI AUTOMATIC firearm. the EXACT same as ANY SEMI AUTOMATIC firearm traditional hunters would use, with a ""scary"" costume on...   funny. many grew up with a pen and paper. i guess you better stop using the computer and internet?   i really suggest people learn about the topic before commenting. SEMI AUTOMATIC firearms are one of the most common actions that HUNTERS use. in the eyes of ""them"", all semi automatic firearms should be banned. that means no more semi auto centerfires or shotguns for hunters too.   are any of those 15 rifles you use for hunting a semi automatic? if so, you're the proud owner of an ""assault rifle"". this is the HUGE thing many hunters who are against ""black rifles"" are missing. by supporting the ban of ""black"" semi automatic firearms you're basically setting yourself up for heartache. you may not like those mean looking black guns, but as firearms owners we ALL need to stand together to protect all of our rights.  that said, i have zero black guns and only one semi auto that is a .22lr i inherited. but, i realize that fighting for someone else benefits us all in the end..."
761543,blarg,2013-01-22 17:12:00,289," There is a lot of truth in that statement.  If the government wanted to reduce the overall number of firearms homicides, and a ban was the only way, they would choose to ban bolt actions and shotguns before 'assault rifles' (every rifle you own is a variant of an assault rifle), more people are killed with hunting rifles and shotguns than with AR's.  But since this is more about optics than actual effective legistlation we let emotions drive the bus.  The point is, ban what you like, people are still going to be shot in droves in the US, oh perhpas a ban will reduce the 5 percent of homicides involving an AR by 10 percent, maybe there will be one less sensationlized story on CNN, and while they cover the next shooting far more people will be shot with a hang gun, and they aren't going anywhere, and more people will be shot with the twelve guage.  Ask yourself, would it have mattered less if those kids, or anyone else, was shot alone or in a group, with a shotgun or an AR, by a guy carrying one gun or four?  Does any of that really matter?  You don't have to look far to find examples of mass shootings with shot guns, hunting rifles, or hand guns.  Do you believe it would have been impossible to shoot those kids, or those firemen if AR's didn't exist?  Blaming the type of gun is just a silly emotional argument, i dont really care if they are banned, i dont want to own one, but it isnt going to prevent this from happening again."

The only reason that plug is even there is to make the gun legal for migratory bird hunting. Even so, I like the ability to remove it so I can fill it with slugs for bear defence. Those extra couple of rounds could make the difference between life and death. One of the firearms they want to ban in the US are the defence type shotguns with the large mags. If I didn't already have my 870 and needed a 12 guage for defence I would get Remmingtons Marine Magnum which is one of those pistol gripped large mag shot guns.  If it were legal in canada I would be carrying a S&W .500 pistol when in the bush for bear defence just because of the portability and ease of carrying.

Again, legitimate. I personally don't think that any of those things are in danger at all, but I will grant that some could. But I also see a hell of a lot of people who seem to be scared simply because they will be without a gun. If you are scared because you don't have a gun, there is something seriously wrong with you, and/or your society. And more guns will not solve those problems."

761333,DoubleDigits,2013-01-21 22:36:00,140,"Actually, they were assault rifles. As in, assault rifles as defined by US law, in the previous Assault Weapons Ban, and the NY laws. They are defined as semi-auto weapons with 'tactical' combat features such as flash suppressors, detachable mags, etc. These are the types of weapons used in Newton and Aurora. To my knowledge, the media, nor anyone here have confused semi-auto and full auto, or .22 with .30..."

761367,aplumma,2013-01-21 23:49:00,6896,Canada has there own gun laws that the citizens voted and approved. The US has a set of gun laws that they voted and approved. It is 2 entirely different mind sets here. You did not have a cultural background that allowed you to grow up with certain types of weapons so they seem evil to you. Examples are pistols and semi automatic weapons that resemble military arms. The M16 was the first rifle I was trained on in the SeaBees along with the M60 both are Full Automatic rifles that are ILLEGAL for any civilian to own without a very special and hard to obtain license. The AR 15 is a semi auto rifle that a trained gunsmith can alter to go full auto how ever he has committed a FELONY and risks some serious jail time. We are not  trying to get full auto rifles into civilian hands but we are trying to keep the CHOICE of what we can have. I can't tell you why a gun collector needs an AR15 in his collection but I defend his right to have that. Realize that no one has ever been killed by a gun they have been killed by the person who aimed the gun. Better background checks  will  be ineffective  some of the worst subhumans in  history went undiscovered. I really don't know how to convince any of the Canadians why this is an important fight but it is. While nothing is black and white nor cut and dry but here on OFC  it will continue to be debated both in wisdom and ignorance with the end result of a few smiles and a few hurt feelings. The final votes will still be cast by the people that it affects the citizens of the United States. Which if passed I hope it is not contagious and inflicts itself on Canada.   Art

At no time was I comparing firearms to fishing.  Merely describing the art of divide and conquer, as it seems to have escaped everyone.  The example of the bait fisherman and the fly fisherman was merely to point you in the direction of how antis use the technique by pitting those within the same community against each other.  In our case, the hunters where left alone with their hunting arms, and told ""we only want those nasty ""assault style guns"".  When they had them either restricted or prohibited, they then began campaigning to have semi auto duck guns and beloved semi auto deer guns like the remington 11-87 and the 7400 restricted or banned.  One only has to look to Australia if you want examples.  Here we have managed to beat them back, and set their confiscation plans back, by hunters and sport shooters ( you know the black gun guys) combining efforts, funds and political will.  The lesson has been learned in ""our"" community, except apparently by a few, who probably never put any time or money into the fight anyway.  For the most part, it's unlikely divide and conquer will work again with the gun guys, because we know once they have the black guns, they will be comig for the wood and blued ones too!  That is all the reference of bait fishing/ fly fishing was getting at.  Because mark my words, P3TA would try to use that against the fisherman.

The bottom one just has different accessories added to it. They are both just target/squirrel guns. Can you kill someone with it, sure you can but there are much better choices.
