760868,lew,2013-01-20 12:10:00,12766,"3:00 this morning it was +5 and raining  5:00 it was like a blizzard and winds strong enough it sounded like a hurricane.  6:00 it was calm and the stars were visible.  Right now it's snowing so hard again I can't see across the road, the winds are howling and the temps have dropped to -6, that's an 11 degree drop in a couple hours.  Good day to stay in the house & work on the honey-do list"
760869,Terry,2013-01-20 12:20:00,14456,"yeah, we had thunder storms over night and now it's like living in a wind tunnel  and snow"
760873,Rich Clemens,2013-01-20 12:29:00,3131,"And it must be coming our way. Low 50's here yesterday and got the vehicles washed.  By tomorrow, the high is 12F.  You guys can keep those temps up there - for the ice fisher-folks."
760874,wormdunker,2013-01-20 12:39:00,1711,"Insane weather here in Niagara.  Plus 2C, winds at 50 km gusting to 90!!  Good thing it's too mild for snow!"
760876,Handlebarz,2013-01-20 12:55:00,3790,Sounds like winter to me glad you guys are having all the fun. Down here in the SW corner I had to attach 8 more tie downs to the house as its been blowing since yesterday. I got to be rocked to sleep and listen to the branches fall from the trees.  I miss the snow but sure love the dry winters we have had around here with just a couple times breaking out the shovel.
760878,outllaw,2013-01-20 13:07:00,1232,winds were up to 100k. last nite. i knew theres advantages to baldness

760902,kickingfrog,2013-01-20 15:06:00,8333,At first when I heard it I though it was the plows. Then the sharp CRACK came and I knew it was thunder and lightning.
761049,esoxansteel,2013-01-20 22:10:00,1307,"Drove carefully to a trib today, hoping that most would stay home due to the weather, which was a good call, as most stayed home, went 4 for 7 on steelhead, ironically with the cold weather those big dark males just dont give up, and the fresh silvers still took to the air."
761120,Walleye Guy,2013-01-21 02:08:00,3,that is a sweet looking run!!
761127,NAW,2013-01-21 02:36:00,4022,"2 trees down on my property.  Luckily, one of the trees was going to be a bit of a technical drop this spring.  But the wind blew it down in the perfect spot.  Saved me a headache."
761135,moxie,2013-01-21 03:07:00,1566,"Headed to parry Sound from Whitby yesterday morning  and tracked snow all the way up, the whole time there and on the way back. Get back home to dry pavement and was serenaded by  January Thunderstorm overnight ? WOW!!!!"
