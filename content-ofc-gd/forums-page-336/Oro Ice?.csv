761368,Cudz,2013-01-21 23:56:00,2652,I know we have an ice report thread but I don't really include Oro in Kbay.  Any one from Oro know what things are like there?  I want to get out there Saturday but I don't want to be that guy.
761370,richyb,2013-01-21 23:58:00,774,At noon it was frozen at the 11th line . But i have seen pics of the 9th line with open water at 5pm.
761373,BillM,2013-01-21 23:59:00,17367,"Chris, definitely don't be that guy, lol!  I'll be very surprised if people are walking out on any part of KBay on the weekend.  Winds aren't very conducive for ice making."
761375,Cudz,2013-01-22 00:04:00,2652,True.  But once ice covers (enough so that it does not move too much) wind does not have much affect.  I thought maybe there was a thin layer already.  If so then it shoudl go quickly.  Looks like I will hit up a smaller lake somewhere.
761377,BillM,2013-01-22 00:06:00,17367,"Yeah, I was hoping the winds wouldn't rip apart the ice we had in Kemp last week, but it didn't stand a chance against those crazy winds we had."
761378,misfish,2013-01-22 00:07:00,29133,"How do you figure? 1st line Oro up to the 7th of ORO,is KBay.LOL  You tie the rope around you,and I will follow,,,,,,,,,,,,100 ft behind ya.LOL"
761381,Terry,2013-01-22 00:15:00,14456,"I always thought the 5th line was the end, but what do I know. I was a Keswick boy"
761395,Rob,2013-01-22 00:39:00,467,"Well being from Oro I would say Terry is right. Sorry Brian the wick guy rules!  I was down at the the 7th around 6pm and it is frozen, but looks like open water about 1/2 mile out for about 1/2 mile wide, it was getting dark so a little hard to see.  I think it will freeze up again tonight as it is already -13c. I'll keep you guys up to date if anyone goes out.  Rob C"
761401,Cudz,2013-01-22 00:44:00,2652,"I count after the 5th too.  2nd and 3rd def in Kbay.  100ft rope in 90ft of water, just enough not to pull you in. lol"
761402,Cudz,2013-01-22 00:45:00,2652,Thanks for the replies guys
