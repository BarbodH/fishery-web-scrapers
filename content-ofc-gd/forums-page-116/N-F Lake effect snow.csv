We could have used some of those Canadian cold fronts this summer!"

Before that, they were hit hard in 1978 which was also a time when we had cooler weather."

I can no longer drive, but need to check my snow plowing contacts to keep the drive cleared.  John, I remember those winters of the later 70's well, I drove a truck and worked on an unheated truck dock. It's pretty rare to see snow here piled up alongside the road as high as the windows on an 18 wheeler. A lot of fish kills here in shallow lakes and ponds in those years."
