980165,NAW,2016-08-22 15:27:00,4022,"We spent the weekend at my hunting partners cottage this past weekend.  Up on 6-mile lake. It's always nice when you see the weather reports all week, and they are predicting rain, thunder and lightening, and winds all weekend.  So you plan for the worst, bring movies, games, rain gear, back up plans in case your stuck in a small cottage with 3 kids!!  BUT....  when it came down to it, there was very little rain, and LOTS of sunshine and fun!!! We spent hours jumping off the dock, swimming, boat rides, and 4 wheeler rides. Saturday night we sat in a gazebo on the water, with the full moon rising behind scattered clouds, and listened to Gord sing his heart out with the radio cranked. I have to admit, I was holding back tears several times through the show.Saturday morning, we let Mom sleep in, and I took the 3 kids out for an early morning fish and boat ride.  I know a few good spots on 6-mile for pan fish.  So we went there (after trying trolling for a while unsuccessfully).  We plowed through a dozen worms in about 30 minutes. All the kids where catching seeds and gills steady, fish after fish.  I was scrambling to keep worms on their hooks!  Payton was using a Barbie rod, and Alex was using a Lightening Mcqueen rod.  Poor Tia (she's 9) got a bad tangle in her rod, and I had no time to fix it, so she ended up helping her little sister land fish after fish.  It was a hoot.  The poor cottagers in the area had a rude awakening by our screams of joy!!Near the end of our fishing, Alex starts screaming at me!!  I look over to see his little rod doubled over, and the tension is flying out..  I was worried he was going to drop the rod, so I took it from him and helped him land a nice little large mouth bass.  The kids wanted to eat it for breakfast, so we did!  And they loved it!!  A true 6-Mile breakfast of eggs, bacon, English muffins, and fresh fried fish (and a Caesar for mom!!)I'll stop typing now, and let the smiles in these pictures show you how happy they where to boat some fish!!Payton didn't want to hold a fish for a picture. But she was totally OK with kissing it!! Crazy kid!"
