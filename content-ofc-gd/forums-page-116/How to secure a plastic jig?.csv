979262,asmodan,2016-08-12 02:59:00,7,"you tube is yr friend  :worthy: just search ""bait keeper"" couple of really interesting option/ideas are there one that worked for me is"
979263,Old Ironmaker,2016-08-12 03:03:00,8243,A little dab will do ya. But I don't like using any chemicals on my tackle. How about a mini plastic band or the smallest electrical tie.
979264,Dutch,2016-08-12 03:13:00,831,"I use dollar store crazy glue with texas rigged senkos. Dont see why that wouldnt work with grubs.  Rig the grub, pull it down from the head a bit, couple of drops of glue, then thread the grub back up. Glue cures real fast.  Added benefit is using the pill type bottle the tubes of glue come in the store hooks.  I use the glue that comes 3-4 small tubes to a bottle."
979267,Old Ironmaker,2016-08-12 04:18:00,8243,That would work Dutch. A small dab won't be harsh enough chemical smell.
979268,manitoubass2,2016-08-12 04:24:00,11391,Just a dab works great. I use gorilla glue however.  The smell doesnt seem to effect anything at all
979269,GBW,2016-08-12 04:59:00,8460,"time to also consider a different jig head, one with a wire keeper works great!  "
979279,wormdunker,2016-08-12 09:34:00,1711,Lottsa god ideas here!  Thanx guys.
979289,mike rousseau,2016-08-12 12:29:00,4661,I kinda like the plastic slipping on hits... Confirms hits over rocks for me... Drifting jigs at 1mph down the st Lawrence I've felt some fishy rocks lol
979291,OhioFisherman,2016-08-12 13:01:00,6623,http://www.gophertackle.com/mushroomjig.html  This brand of jig head worked well for me in the past.
979297,Garnet,2016-08-12 13:31:00,2056,You can make those jigs using shrink tubing. Just cut tubing on acute angle take a lighter and shrink it then pull the small tab out.  If you want it even more secure run a tooth pick thru plastic just in front of tap. Nip both sides off.
979340,misfish,2016-08-12 19:59:00,29133,http://www.gophertackle.com/mushroomjig.html  This brand of jig head worked well for me in the past.  Yup. those work well Paul.
979356,OhioFisherman,2016-08-13 01:38:00,6623," Yup. those work well Paul. I would fish a 6 inch plastic worm or lizard on a jig head a lot, so the choices of hooks was nice, a bit longer hook for them. Heavier wire hook for tournament day!"
979364,singingdog,2016-08-13 11:07:00,1047,"If you really want a grub (or any plastic) to last, put a small drop of glue on two spots: where the grub touches the jig head, and where the hook exits the grub body. Pre-rig a few before you hit the water, so you don't get all messy with the glue when the bite is hot."
979371,manitoubass2,2016-08-13 16:44:00,11391,Exactly what I do.  I have 6 or 8 that I fish heavely and always have them pre rigged
979404,fishindevil,2016-08-13 23:32:00,6254,Yup dollar store crazy glue I use that sh#t on everything !!!! Lol ....
979408,206,2016-08-13 23:48:00,563,I kinda like the plastic slipping on hits... Confirms hits over rocks for me... Drifting jigs at 1mph down the st Lawrence I've felt some fishy rocks lol I find the tail bitten off confirms the eye are munching lol

If it's not the panfish, it's the weeds that pull it halfway off every second cast. I've heard crazy glue. How exactly do you use it? I used to do the glue routine....then I  discovered lunkercity lunker grip jigheads. Have not used glue since 2002. Do a google search and check out there jigheads. Marks wormwarehouse in Caygeon has been ordering what I want for years. I use unpainted 1/32 heads for all my panfishing and whatever colours I choose for larger size heads. Besides the grub/plastic  holding properties of these heads which is excellent...I dare   you to find a better hook sharpness or quality then these products.  Seriously have a look and forget about using glue...cause you won't need it with these jigheads."
979440,mike rousseau,2016-08-14 08:22:00,4661,Haven't used big ones but these are the best panfish jigs I have used
979473,captpierre,2016-08-14 17:44:00,2521,Hey. These look great. Weedless types too. Will check them out. Thanks!!
979953,Beans,2016-08-19 15:14:00,3339,I agree with CPH...Fin-S jigs by Lunker City...Their plastics work well also...
979958,adempsey,2016-08-19 18:19:00,1498,I saw this mentioned in a thread about barbless hooks.  Guy suggested using a hole punch to punch out little plastic discs from a milk bottle to keep the bait on.   Not sure if that would work in this situation or not though.
