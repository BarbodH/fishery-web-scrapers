980475,aplumma,2016-08-26 20:28:00,6896,The price of the water seems to be offensive to some but it really is just the first in amount of money that Canada reaps. The $3.75 per Million liters is money coming into the Canadian monetary system from an external source. It then supplies an income for the workers. The second party consumer that sells it to the stores will make money and the retailer as well. The taxes paid by the consumer then goes into the government for other projects. For the water that goes to the US the initial price paid as well as the jobs supported and export fees all stay in Canada. The importing of water is not a practice that is economical when the water is available from closer sources at a lesser cost. Unless it can be sold at a higher price such as FIJI bottled water ( great marketing same H2O) canadian water for bottled resale in the US is minimum.  Art

Over many, many beers we've talked about how Nestlé is viewed by the public vs. how Nestlé really is. At the plant I toured most recently, Nestlé's waste water gets re-processed and piped back to the local municipality where it joins the municipal water supply. They have aggressive targets for reducing environmental impact and helping their communities. They account for something like <0.0004% of water taken in Canada.  And maybe most importantly, Nestlé Waters has said publicly at numerous hearings that they are prepared to pay whatever the proper fee is, as long as other for-profit water-takers pay too.  G.mech posted some good data. We need to clean this issue up but we need to manage by facts, and that means starting with waste by municipalities, mines, golf courses, etc."

The other permits you described do not show up on the Ontario list anywhere that I can find.  They have 2 plants in Canada, the Aberfoyle plant and one in Hope BC.  The Aberfoyle plant bottles most of it's water from it's source well at the plant and also draws about 25% (or less) from it's well in Erin township, no other source wells are presently used.  The actual bottling capacity of the Aberfoyle plant is under 4 million LPD flat out at 100% efficiency (4 high speed lines that run 1200 1/2 liter bottles per minute, and one slower line that does around 800 or so) .  The Hope BC plant is about 1/3 of that capacity.  The plants do not run at full capacity for other then a couple of months in the Spring, the rest of the year they idle some of their bottling lines as sales are much higher in the summer months.   Also, the water from Aberfoyle is bottled for the Canadian market and is not normally shipped to the US but there are some rare instances where it is including that flavoured 'Splash' garbage they bottle.  The Hope BC plant does routinely ship to the US however.    As you suggest, they do use a ton of electricity and plastic in bottle making which itself is an environmental concern far greater than the water as far as I'm concerned.  Anyway, it's kind of a moot point but there sure is a lot of misinformation floating around in the media these days and much of it seems to spring forth from the WWW (pardon the pun ).    It's groups like this with their half baked hype who were responsible for the all the witch burnings back in the middle ages.  I would just like to reiterate that I am not a supporter of Nestle or their water business and have no skin in the game I just don't like some of the tactics these special interest groups use and wanted to try and keep the facts as straight as possible (I do have some inside knowledge of the plants in question).  If it wasn't for the 300 jobs and all the spinoffs in trucking, construction, etc from the plant I'd be leading the parade to have them shut down.

The US based company bottles the water in Canada for Canada for the most part saves on trucking costs import fees and taxes. The less they pay for water the cheaper the end product is. Now double the purchase price of the raw water and the end product will be less desirable due to the cost point of business. Now Nestles will be branded as gouging and ripping off Canadians. If the end product remains in Canada then you get money from the water sale and also the taxes and 2nd person sales profit. It is money staying in Canada as well as money from Nestles. Now look at the other major consumers of water with the detrimental byproduct that are returning to the environment that have to be either cleaned up or left to damage the water and land.

However it doesn't take a crystal ball to see the future of resource consumption in the world.  It is easier to pollute water than it is to remove the pollution.  It is easier to run a well dry than to fill it back up.  Desalination is still too expensive to be a viable option from everything I have read.  According to the UN (I know there are better sources but this isn't a career for me, I don't have time to dig deeper right now), ""There is enough freshwater on the planet for seven billion people but it is distributed unevenly and too much of it is wasted, polluted and unsustainably managed."" (source link: http://www.un.org/waterforlifedecade/scarcity.shtml). If you look at the attached picture, you can see that Canada and even the USA are looking pretty good compared to a wide swath of the planet along the equator:   This is good news, of course. It means we are in good shape right now.  This is all the more reason to stress conservation right now.  It is far easier to not use it up/pollute it in the first place.  It's not fear-mongering for me to say we should be conserving the resource now before we actually do face a crisis.  Also from the same link ""Water use has been growing at more than twice the rate of population increase in the last century, and, although there is no global water scarcity as such, an increasing number of regions are chronically short of water.""  So there is not currently a global water shortage. If we continue to give it away for free and pollute it for another hundred years because anytime someone brings up conservation they are labelled as a conspiracy theorist, my prediction is only more certain to come true.  It's never a bad time to start conserving water.  That is only my opinion, but I stand by it."

It is an agenda that is being touted as a  grave issue that it really isn't. The cost to desalination a gallon of water is 28 cents on a commercial scale and that includes equipment cost and overhead. The bottle water is just a drop in the bucket when you think about a flush of a toilet (water saver) is 6 bottles of water each time you push the lever. A faucet running is for 1 minute is 10 bottles and a shower can be as high as 20 bottles a minute. (1 bottle equals a liter)These are items that we actually waste water meaning it is not being drunk to keep ourselves alive. Now nature has it's own way to purify water and if it is allowed to do so then the rain water will return to the earth uncontaminated and be reused. When we pollute the basins that the water returns to (think mining run off and chemical on golf courses) the water returns to a contaminated basin. This is the where the water becomes an issue. This is no longer free water that can be drunk. This is water that has to be treated over and over to make it drinkable. This is one of the reason desalination is not a good answer. To go after Nestle is not solving the issue some say it is a start but if you want to see a result you go after the big perpetrator not the little ones. Curing 5% of the offenders will leave 95% still active. It is like saying I want to lose weight so I will no longer eat lobster instead of cutting out bread. Nestle is doing nothing wrong they are taking water to be drunk same as tap water and selling it to the public just like your local municipalities.

980314,G.mech,2016-08-24 09:32:00,830,"A bottle deposit would certainly help get rid of the waste created by the bottles..  To me, the bottles are a far bigger concern than the water in them (be it pure water or soda or whatever) and I think you're right that a deposit would help get them into the recycling stream.. I'm not really a fan of more rules or regulations but in this case, maybe it would be an idea.  I don't think we should model our province after BC in most cases but they have a deposit on all containers that seems pretty effective.  One of the challenges that comes with it however is people raiding blue boxes in search of bottles on garbage day.  Apparently some of them get a little territorial and some dump the boxes on people's lawns and leave a mess to be cleaned up.  The US does very, very little to attempt to recycle plastic containers which is a huge problem given the amount they consume, it would be nice to see them step up the efforts a bit too."

You must sort your trash into garbage, paper, plastic and the trash companies take it and dump/ recycle. If you hand carry to the dump again you must sort it out. We also have deposits on bottles and cans depending on where you live. We still have room to improve and it is slowly heading towards being greener here.

The golf course up the road does have permits to take a lot of water, but it's only about half as much (totalling three separate wells) as Nestle.  To be frank, I agree that there must be some sort of ""hidden agenda"" here or conspiracy against Nestle.

I grew up on well water from a 200' drilled well and the water in Fergus is just as good.

It is a map showing all the Water Taking Permits in Ontario.  If you click on the dots, it tells you the company and the permitted volume/day.  Interestingly, Nestle is permitted at 3,600,000 liters/day and right next door the old Dufferin Aggregates (now called CRH Group) plant is permitted over 8,000,000 per day and St Mary's Cement is permitted for 23,000,000.  The Victoria Park Golf Club has 3 permits totaling almost 3,000,000 lpd.  These are just a couple of examples of the hundreds of permits on the map to look through, I'm sure you'll be surprised how many industries are pulling water from that watershed in huge quantities.  This is why I don't understand WWW's focus on only one mid sized user/abuser.  Edit: I just noticed that a large vegetable farm just down the road from me has 7 different permits each over 7,000,000 lpd (total 14 times that of Nestle's) and has been irrigating continuously all summer (for profit) which may have something to do with my well being dry.....hmmm.  https://www.ontario.ca/environment-and-energy/map-permits-take-water"
