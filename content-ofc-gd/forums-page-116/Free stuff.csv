980693,Big Cliff,2016-08-29 20:37:00,6899,"The one in the basement is pretty old, quite usable but you'd want to throw a cover on the seat part or recover the cushions.  The other one is sitting in my living room, mind you I'm not a big fan of SHOW stuff so it might not be to every ones taste, we're kind of casual."
980696,GBW,2016-08-29 21:59:00,8460,I have a friend that might be able to use the cabinet.  Have any pic's so I can see the size and to show her?  I can make it tomorrow during the day to get it if it fits in her place.

980699,GBW,2016-08-29 22:57:00,8460,Thanks Cliff and it looks very nice but it's too big for her.  Next person needing this should be very happy with it.  If I can get the pic off my phone and one to the PC to post it for you I will.
980700,GBW,2016-08-29 22:58:00,8460,The pic Cliff sent of the hutch... 
980701,Big Cliff,2016-08-29 23:18:00,6899,"Thanks Geoff It's a beautiful piece of furniture and probably worth several hundred $ to the right person, it was my mother-in-laws so old school solid wood. Our new place is just too small for it."
980704,manitoubass2,2016-08-30 00:06:00,11391,I can wire it to ya!
980705,Tom McCutcheon,2016-08-30 00:13:00,627,"Wonderful gesture Cliff...  If you can't find a home for it, I am sure Habitat for Humanity or some other worthy cause could find a suitable family."
980707,ketchenany,2016-08-30 00:27:00,3229,Yes call people and they will collect it. When my mom passed we gave her stuff away and we still do when we no longer need it. It's a shame how much good stuff lands Ina landfill!
980809,Beans,2016-08-31 15:03:00,3339,I just knew I had a picture of the cabinet...  
980819,Tom McCutcheon,2016-08-31 18:03:00,627,Looks like mugs of A&W root beer on the table......
980823,GBW,2016-08-31 18:36:00,8460,"Looks like mugs of A&W root beer on the table...... And that's why the Lindsay A&W now has a sign ""no glass outside"""
980826,manitoubass2,2016-08-31 19:15:00,11391,Lol  My guess is those are old.  I used to have some from like 20 years ago. Top notch mugs
980828,Tom McCutcheon,2016-08-31 19:19:00,627,I had a whack of them 10 or 15 from the 60's both sizes large and small. They were great to keep in the freezer in order to serve cold beer to company.  My wife made the decision to donate them to the church yard sale.......
980833,Big Cliff,2016-08-31 20:38:00,6899,"Hey, that's where I got them, a church yard sale, $5.00 a piece. Still have two left."
