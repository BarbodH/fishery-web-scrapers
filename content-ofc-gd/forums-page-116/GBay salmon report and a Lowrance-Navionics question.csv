979978,fishnguy,2016-08-19 20:59:00,96,"Finally started finding some nice salmon around Owen Sound.  70-80 feet of water running anchovies has been the ticket.  Would love to attach an inline image of my little guy with a nice salmon but cant figure out how to compress to 250kb. Any tips?  Separately, wondering if anyone else has had this problem with their chartplotter/fishfinder.  I've got the Navionics Sonar Charts, which are amazing.  BUT the GPS is off by at least 100M.  So when it's showing the boat over a nice reef or dropoff, I'm actually more than 100M away, which is kind of frustrating and a bit useless.  It's fine for following a specific break line, but makes it hard to find smaller pieces of structure.  Anyone had this problem?  My finder is a Lowrance if that matters.  Thanks "

Otherwise, I've found some maps to be pretty wrong in some areas. If you have a setup that will make your own maps, just re-chart everything."
