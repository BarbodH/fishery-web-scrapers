980331,Steve,2016-08-24 13:52:00,2075,"powerdrives don't hold their value as well as the cable drive models, as the pedals and other electrical often goes for a crap.  Likely can still get $400 or so, depending on condition.  Maxxums of the same age and power will bring a better return."
980336,AKRISONER,2016-08-24 14:44:00,5558,"...you dont wanna know what i paid for my old PD1  its good to have good friends lol...from what ive seen pete, that model would probably go for about 400 bucks.  As mentioned the pedals break easily."
980338,captpierre,2016-08-24 15:36:00,2521,Been looking at the new high end ones with anchor feature etc. ??? Ain't cheap. $2.5k +
980345,Bass Tard,2016-08-24 17:35:00,128,I've been waiting on a used Maxxum!  The powerdrives seem to be all over Kijiji..
980346,Dan668,2016-08-24 17:40:00,1120,I sold my terrova for what i paid after 4 years use lol.  Power drives take a pretty big hit.
980360,Steve,2016-08-24 21:41:00,2075,"anchor feature is slick....in deep water.  the sound, vibration, and general commotion that the anchor feature uses trying to stay anchored in windy conditions is horrible in shallow water (<10')"
980362,tizfun,2016-08-24 22:20:00,292,My buddy just bought a new-take off Powerdrive V2 70 lbs 24 volt 60 inch shaft with US2 and auto pilot for 900.00... You'll get more than 400.00 for it..  I'll bet my LAST DOLLAR on it !!!!  I sold a Powerdrive 55 lbs 12 volt 4 months ago for $350.00..  Look around at what's out there and what's selling.. Look at the price of a new one and go from there..  Just be patient.. It'll sell
980364,boombap,2016-08-24 22:24:00,310,"Letting my 6 month old power drive v2 go at the end of the season, I miss having a cable driven tm.  I would think I could get $350-$400 for it."
980365,landry,2016-08-24 22:48:00,1005,There's a guy on here named Josh who was looking for one a while back. Maybe send him a PM.
980370,porkpie,2016-08-25 01:10:00,2521,"My buddy got $500 easy, no bargaining at the start of summer for exact same motor."
980374,Fisherpete,2016-08-25 10:32:00,1814,"Cool, thanks guys. Will pass the info along. If I hadn't picked up a Terrova this year I would probably grab it!  Cheers Pete"
980381,Sinker,2016-08-25 13:30:00,8692,I might be interested if/when he decides to sell it.  S.
980433,Mister G,2016-08-26 09:34:00,1429,I might be interested if/when he decides to sell it.  S. And then upgrade it to a iPilot and fish away.
980461,Fisherpete,2016-08-26 18:54:00,1814,I'll let you know Shayne - he's just started looking into a Terrova or similar.
