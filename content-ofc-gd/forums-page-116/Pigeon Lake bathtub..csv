980000,Old Ironmaker,2016-08-20 04:43:00,8243,"Great Bass Chris. I have found Large Mouth don't seem to be affected by warm water as other fish are. I've caught them in Cuba in bath water shallows.  My not so favorite Bro-in-law stopped who started fishing 5 years ago and he can now have his own show, that guy. He was bragging how he caught a 42"" Musky this year on a ultra light and played her out for well over 30 minutes and took 10 minutes to release it. He was so proud of himself. After listening to this Jim Saric wanna be I told him he should have run the boat up to it and cut the line when he knew it was a big Musky. Why? Because you killed it and explained why I thought so. You might as well shot it. Am I wrong? I'm not a Musky guy but know that much."
980006,manitoubass2,2016-08-20 06:16:00,11391,"Thats true with bass. Ive caught smallies too in sick hot water and im not even sure how the fish are alive? They feel like jello  Was you not so favorite fishing 600ft behind the boat?  Me thinks hes fibbing you.  Ive caught a few mid forties fiah on rainy lake on 4lb test crappie fishing and unfortunately I did kill a good pike with what id estimate was more like an 8 minute fight. My bad, shoulda cut the line.  My pb pike(47"") took less then 4 minutes with 20lb braid.  Longest fight id ever had is with an 8 foot 100lb sturgeon and that legit took an hour(I know, we filmed it).  And just being honest, pike and musky are like a perch fight compared to sturgeon"
980007,Old Ironmaker,2016-08-20 08:21:00,8243,"A 100 lb Surgeon can take an hour for sure. That must have been a blast. I have seen them but never caught one. Years back a 7.5 footer washed up on shore down the road. A beast. I took a pic and they put it and my report in the weekly rag we have out here. The local had it hanging on his back hoe. It weighed in over 100 lbs. I still have the pic I need to find it. All the kids in the area said there was a monster in the lake that summer swimming, they were right.  See a PM from me. Kirsten must be up playing with Pops."
980008,manitoubass2,2016-08-20 08:33:00,11391,"Yep sturgeon are nutso. And these are just lake sturgeon, nevermind those beasts in BC! I couldnt imagine!!!  Kar is sleeping. Daddy just forgot why you dont hit the gym at 930pm???"
980023,huzzsaba,2016-08-20 16:18:00,884,Visited Lake belwood a couple of days to take the kids trout fishing in the trout ponds.  Was told the main lake had toxic blue and green algae growing.  Fish are not safe for eating.  Is this the issue with most smaller lakes?
980024,huzzsaba,2016-08-20 16:42:00,884,"I call this the season that never was. Levels here on Erie are high. We have 2 feet of beach where we normally have 20'. I have caught a grand total of 3 pics. Not 1 Erie jumbo, not 1 this year. Get this, water temp at 75 feet deep is 75F. Not even the Pic gurus are catching fish.  I have caught more fish when I lived in downtown Hamilton and didn't have a boat or a clue. This year definitely worst than last year especially for shore fishing.  I was at rock point PP a few weeks ago and I may have and lots of dead fish washed up on the beach. Same report I got from my friends who camped at turkey point. Lots of dead fish."
979252,captpierre,2016-08-12 01:43:00,2521,Water levels are low. Surface temps at the NE end this afternoon 82.5F Has turned fairly green since a week ago Lots of algae. Might get a bloom soon if weather doesn't change soon.
979292,Rizzo,2016-08-12 13:04:00,4754,We have been staying down near Gannon's....the water is certainly no cooler over here. The bazillion bluegill my kids catch off the dock are literally warm to the touch
979296,DanD,2016-08-12 13:27:00,2223,The water is warm all over. We were in Elk Lake a week or so ago and the river temp was in the high 70s - low 80s; that's the warmest I've seen the Montreal river.  Dan
979299,Dontcryformejanhrdina,2016-08-12 13:54:00,535,High temps have kept me from musky fishing for well over a month now. Well at least I'm getting lots of firewood cut...
979302,AKRISONER,2016-08-12 14:17:00,5558,High temps have kept me from musky fishing for well over a month now. Well at least I'm getting lots of firewood cut...  eww  my buddy with a place on buckhorn just east of the ganny is pretty much done with it..says the water is just gross  with water temps that high maybe we will end up with florida 10lb bass
979305,Rizzo,2016-08-12 14:32:00,4754,...yes that is a good reason for me to sit at lakeside with a beer rather than head out for muskies
979307,captpierre,2016-08-12 15:01:00,2521,"Caught a 36 incher last evening jigging for eyes. Most fight I've seen in a Muskie in a long time. Diving, jumping. Wouldn't give up. Swam away strong after unhooking too. Hope it survives"
979312,AKRISONER,2016-08-12 15:42:00,5558,"Caught a 36 incher last evening jigging for eyes. Most fight I've seen in a Muskie in a long time. Diving, jumping. Wouldn't give up. Swam away strong after unhooking too. Hope it survives  smaller one definitely has a way better chance than the old brutes. I dont think a mid 40 musky would survive being caught in that temperature no matter how fast the fight, and how perfectly and fast you release it."
979313,fishnsled,2016-08-12 16:07:00,3520,Even Lake Ontario is a bath tub.  Temps were over 80 for a few miles out before dropping to 78 on the surface.
979315,Tom McCutcheon,2016-08-12 16:27:00,627,"I'm glad someone other than me mentioned the warm water and high mortality rate of Muskies... Personally, I put my Muskie gear away three weeks ago. I don't have a problem with folks who catch one at this time of year so long as they realize the fragile nature of the beast and release it in the water without the obligatory out of water photo op. Most will recover, however as Akrisoner stated some won't no matter what we do.  A few years ago, in mid summer, I personally spent about an hour with a fish wading in shallow water holding it up right, until it swam off on it's own."
979316,lew,2016-08-12 16:29:00,12766,I'm leaving tomorrow morning for a 2 week musky trip to the West Arm of Nippissing and aren't liking the conditions I'm hearing with these crazy hot water temps. Air temps are sposed to drop into the 70's up there starting in a day or 2 so hopefully that'll bring the water temps down too.
979322,Tom McCutcheon,2016-08-12 16:43:00,627,"Do you want to borrow a couple of Bass and Walleye rods Lew?  Just kidding, I know you have the utmost respect for your targeted species."
979324,lew,2016-08-12 16:46:00,12766,What's a bass & walleye Tom ? LOL

Saw a floating musky last weekend on Sturgeon. No boat marks on it, figured it was a poor release. Sad to see. Tried to revive it but it was to late."
979328,Dontcryformejanhrdina,2016-08-12 17:25:00,535,"Yeah the smaller ones almost always seem to revive quicker, if they even need reviving at all."
979329,Tom McCutcheon,2016-08-12 17:25:00,627,"What's a bass & walleye Tom ? LOL  Bait......  Have a great trip Lew. and say hello to your old boat.. We will be heading up to the French (Wolsley Bay) just after Thanksgiving for a week and the temps should be good again by then. In fact each year for the past 4, we have had at least one day with snow and sleet during our stay."
979331,lew,2016-08-12 17:32:00,12766,"Thanks Tom, and best of luck to you too when you head north, chances are you'll do well up there that time of year."
979407,fishindevil,2016-08-13 23:40:00,6254,The Muskie pros are telling people not to fish for Muskies now as its death temps for them ..... And even the cold clear deep lakes of northern Haliburton where I fish are getting warm a lot warmer than I have seen in many years .... Even with all the high cold water they had all spring and early summer a lake I fished the other day was 79  no gross water up there yet but yes here in the Kawarthas it's gross ...... A lot of algae
979568,msp,2016-08-15 18:30:00,1336,These warmer temps sure make for great largemouth fishing ! Stellar season so far. 3 fish over 6 and multiple over 5 boated this year for us
979572,manitoubass2,2016-08-15 18:44:00,11391,I wonder if thats why im seeing musky in the river all of a sudden? Chasing the cooler water
979622,chris.brock,2016-08-16 00:01:00,4053,"no pictures, it didn't happen  yeah, LMB fishing has been good.    If I see a dead fish or a seagull pecking at something floating, I always boat over and check it out. Lots of common white suckers belly up in my area, I don't know what that's about.  The walleye in my area aren't coming in shallow at all, even after dark. It's all 18 FOW or more. If that's the case on Pigeon Captain, that should help you eliminate a lot of water."
979626,misfish,2016-08-16 00:13:00,29133,Is that a colts menthol? LOL  Nice fish dude.
979628,manitoubass2,2016-08-16 00:17:00,11391,Nice fish Chris!!!!

979635,chris.brock,2016-08-16 00:44:00,4053," Menthol ultra uber light.  If you come up and bring your toon we can fish that private lake. If you tried to get back in yourself later, the gatekeeper Crazy Bob and his 12 gauge are known for causing trouble.  "
