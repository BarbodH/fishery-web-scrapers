980071,mattyk,2016-08-21 12:49:00,2110,"I was lucky to get a chance to fish a lot this summer. We spent two week on lake nipissing in ontario at Callender Bay. We stayed at Glen Echo Cottages and had a lovely time. They have great fishing boats with brand new 30hp 4 stroke engines with new fish finders. The fishing was pretty good despite the very hot temperatures. We caught lots of walleye and smallmouth bass and some sheephead and pike too. I fished a few times for muskies and had a fish follow my bucktail twice, with no luck. Most of our fish were caught in the 20-25 ft range. We fished for about 2 hours in the morning and 2 hours at sunset. It was too hot to fish during the day. Most of our fish were on live bait and the kids caught a lot of fish and had a good time. We did catch a s few on lures too. We also spent a week in vermont on Lake Champlain about 40 minutes south of montreal. We fished for about an hour in the mornings off the dock and at sunset. We caught a lot of bass both largemouth and smallmouth. We also caught a lot of perch which kept the kids happy. We also caught some bowfin and a pike too which was a nice surprise. We also spent a week at the ocean in Delaware. We caught floudner, weakfish and striped bass. All the fish were caught on berkley gulp on jig heads. This one day we caught about 20 flounder in about 1 hours of fishing and the action was non stop. Kids had a lot of fun. I'll let the pictures do the talking.

980145,Joeytier,2016-08-22 10:10:00,3990,"Always love your reports man.  I recognize a few of those Callander bay spots, you were definitely over good water, my ice fishing haunts from when I used to fish there far more often.  Your kids have already caught and landed more toad largies than most adults!"
980148,Sterling,2016-08-22 11:49:00,477,"Nice report!  Regarding Nipissing, too hot for the fish or for you guys?  I'm asking because I had tremendous success in the afternoon (all day in fact) on Nip, the fish are out there and they're biting!"
980242,mattyk,2016-08-23 01:17:00,2110,It was too hot for us. It was 28-31 degrees most days sunny and humid. Water was 77 degrees on the fish finder.
980273,Cast-Away,2016-08-23 17:15:00,790,"Very cool report, I love the smiles on the kids faces and that they are holding fish at such a young age! The Jays hat and Canada hat are nice to see guessing you relocated to Pennsylvania?"
