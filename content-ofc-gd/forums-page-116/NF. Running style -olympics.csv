979987,captpierre,2016-08-19 23:53:00,2521,Watching the relay. Noticed they run on the balls( front ) of their feet. Heels  hardly touch the track. Is this the way you're supposed to run!
979988,DRIFTER_016,2016-08-20 00:03:00,10439,NAH!!! â€‹They're women!!!! Their feet are stuck that way from wearing high heels!!!!!
979990,chris.brock,2016-08-20 01:02:00,4053, i don't run on my balls

979998,Old Ironmaker,2016-08-20 04:17:00,8243,"If your balls can touch the ground you should be making movies.  If someone knows how to run fast the heels never touch the ground unless making a cut. The insteps should never  touch the ground again unless making a turn then it's the outside, maybe. Look at runners spikes, hardly anything behind the balls of the feet."
