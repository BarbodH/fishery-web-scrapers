980749,captpierre,2016-08-30 15:43:00,2521,"Wow. You have a lot of success with figure 8s. I'm watching every retrieve for follows with polarized sunglasses. Certainly will do a figure 8 then, for at least a minute. Otherwise just an L with every cast. Have caught some by a short cast in the direction they spook off after a follow."
980761,Rich Clemens,2016-08-30 17:26:00,3131,"I would have to say that most of my hits are very close to the boat.  Much higher percentage than the ski taking the bait during the actual retrieve.   Even after the 8, when it seems the fish has moved on, I will continue the 8 for a little while, as she may just still be hanging around, just our of site.  This has proved fruitful on a few occasions."
980775,Pigeontroller,2016-08-30 21:15:00,2793,"Same as using a Bass sized baitcaster over a spinning rod. Most prefer it, but its an individual thing."
980777,landry,2016-08-30 21:35:00,1005,On super clear water where I can see bottom then an L turn is what I would do but I have been surprised in super clear deep water where a fish was obviously following really deep a few times. St Clair fish seem less boat shy than Kawarthas fish.
980779,DaveRoach,2016-08-30 21:41:00,202,"I find I can cast a baitcaster much quicker without having to open the bail in between casts, and I have better control over the fight, the spinning reel certainly has it's place but for Muskie it's a no brainer for me."
980783,FloatnFly,2016-08-30 23:03:00,1640,"ok, so basically boils down to what you're more comfortable with. I've never gone musky fishing, so not sure of the gear used and whatnot.  maybe someday."
980784,Fisherpete,2016-08-30 23:41:00,1814,Try retrieving a twin ten inline with a spinning reel and you will instantly have your answer!
980785,FloatnFly,2016-08-30 23:55:00,1640,"Try retrieving a twin ten inline with a spinning reel and you will instantly have your answer!  musky lures are lost on me.  never been, don't know them. biggest lure i cast is a j12"
980791,Steelheadphycho,2016-08-31 02:15:00,470,.......... WAKE UP!!!  LOL!!!
980802,Dontcryformejanhrdina,2016-08-31 10:53:00,535,It's like reeling in a small ceiling fan. It will literally pull your boat in the direction of the cast. Great lures though.
980821,Crazy Ivan,2016-08-31 18:30:00,184,"I have found that figure 8s are more successful in stained water. In the video, he didnt see that fish till it was on his lure."
980622,FloatnFly,2016-08-29 03:34:00,1640,http://www.outdoorhub.com/news/2016/08/19/video-violent-muskie-strike-see-believe/
980627,Hank Jr,2016-08-29 11:21:00,146,Funny video and how true when you lease expect it
980628,lew,2016-08-29 11:53:00,12766,"I've said it a hundred times before, but nothing gets the old heart pounding better that a big musky hammering your bait 2' from the boat.  Great video."
980629,captpierre,2016-08-29 12:29:00,2521,So you don't even need to push your rod tip way under the surface  to do the figure 8. Mind you this was a top water lure.
980637,Rizzo,2016-08-29 13:34:00,4754,too funny.
980639,FloatnFly,2016-08-29 13:50:00,1640,"i've had walleye strike with less than 2ft of line out, makes a pretty good shock, could not imagine a 30lb fish striking with that much line out"
980640,Tom McCutcheon,2016-08-29 14:18:00,627,I like the grin on the guides face as he walks back to straighten out the mess on the floor....
980641,Smokercrafty,2016-08-29 14:27:00,227,"Hahaaa. That is just plain awesome! Didn't appear to be a fish of great size, but just goes to show what happens when you're not ready."
980642,Tjames09,2016-08-29 14:30:00,664,"The guy was barely holding onto the rod, no wonder it ripped right out of his hand. I love the ""that was a musky?!""...""yeah that was a musky"" lol."
980653,mattyk,2016-08-29 16:11:00,2110,"Very cool! I was at the French River with a couple of guys when my buddy catches a small walleye. He brings it up and as he's lifting it out of the water this musky grabs the walleye (while about 6"" in the air) and takes the fish and snaps the 6lb line. We were all in shock!"
980659,manitoubass2,2016-08-29 16:35:00,11391,"Hahaha ive had similar happen lots but its always pike.  Just a few weeks back I was about to fish off this dock with my kids and I hadnt even casted my crawfish out and a 20"" pike launched and grabbed it about 2ft in the air!  We were just laughing as I reeled the fished in. No hookset needed he just engullfed the lure hahaha"
980663,Rich Clemens,2016-08-29 16:56:00,3131,"And all the times you perform your figure-8, see nothing.  Then as soon as you lift the lure out of the water ....  she swims right on by.    :wallbash:"
980667,Pigeontroller,2016-08-29 17:35:00,2793,THAT'S why Muskie fishing is so awesome!
980674,Dontcryformejanhrdina,2016-08-29 18:38:00,535, Or you turn to make another cast and just hear a big splash...
980686,lew,2016-08-29 19:58:00,12766,"For any of you newer musky guys who aren't doing a figure 8 after EVERY cast your guaranteed to be missing a huge amount of fish. Here's just a couple examples of many many muskies I've boated over the past 4 decades on figure 8's.  Just something to think about if your not fully completing your cast.  Even if you don't see a fish following your bait, do a figure 8 anyways and you'll be very happy with the results.....over and over and over ....    "
980708,Rich Clemens,2016-08-30 00:43:00,3131,"Or, you are doing a nice figure 8 at the front of the boat.  She is a little interested and makes a couple passes by your lure.   Then she leaves your bait, swims to the back of the boat and smashes your wife's bait.   That's how Patsy caught her 49 some years back.  Thanks Honey .....  Sure, no problem."
980709,FloatnFly,2016-08-30 01:12:00,1640,"question for the experienced, why do musky fisherman prefer baitcasters over spinning gear?"
980710,landry,2016-08-30 01:45:00,1005,Spinning feels do not handle big heavy baits well and a baitcaster can be thumbed as the bait lands to ensure instant retrieval or blades spinning and u can also hit free-spool and thumb the spool if u hook up on the figure eight.
980712,captpierre,2016-08-30 01:46:00,2521,"I get the usefulness of a figure 8. But after a day of casting,  the frequent figure 8s have cut the total number  your casts down by maybe 10-20%. How many other fish could have been caught. Just sayin."
980715,leaf4,2016-08-30 01:54:00,2466,That would be quite the surprise if you've never gotten one on a figure 8 before lol
980717,Kerry,2016-08-30 02:05:00,383,"I get the usefulness of a figure 8. But after a day of casting, the frequent figure 8s have cut the total number your casts down by maybe 10-20%. How many other fish could have been caught. Just sayin. But with musky being notorious for following baits the figure 8 or L turn or even a circle at boatside can turn that follower into a biter and may even increase your hookup rate by 10 or 20%. With the limited time I get to go out I want to use the most efficient way for a hook up.A lure in the water is better than one in the air. Kerry"
980718,FloatnFly,2016-08-30 02:10:00,1640,"Spinning feels do not handle big heavy baits well and a baitcaster can be thumbed as the bait lands to ensure instant retrieval or blades spinning and u can also hit free-spool and thumb the spool if u hook up on the figure eight. the figure 8 i can see, but wouldn't the heavy duty salt water reels stand up to tossing big baits?"
980719,bare foot wader,2016-08-30 02:30:00,1354," I think they shine for shore fishers who need the casting distance, and also those who don't favour baitcasters  That was a good video lol"
980721,landry,2016-08-30 03:43:00,1005,"Captpierre,  I see what u r saying and I used to think that way when I started musky fishing maniacally 10 years ago. But, I can tell u that it is better and more productive than the extra 10-20% in casts u could get - especially on certain lakes like St Clair. Last year, 80% of my fish on that lake came on figure eights. That is much higher than typical but that's no exaggeration. And I fish a fair bit last year so that was a good number sample to work from. This year - I have hardly been fishing:("
980723,Rich Clemens,2016-08-30 09:11:00,3131,"I used the open faced reels for many years.  Couple years ago I bought my first baitcaster.  Since, then, I have purchased a second set-up.   To me, it seems that I have much better control over my bait with the baitcaster during the retrieve and figure 8"
