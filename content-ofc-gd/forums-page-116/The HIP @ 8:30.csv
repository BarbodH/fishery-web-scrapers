980169,fishindevil,2016-08-22 16:28:00,6254,having seen them 2 times in the past as well as watching them on tv and streaming all of their other shows the last few weeks I did not have a dry eye either.....they are awesome .....and I hope gord is around along time and wish them well
980193,crappieperchhunter,2016-08-22 19:24:00,2582,Walked up from the cottage to the main drag...Bolton St...in Bobcaygeon. The street was closed and they had big screens set up to watch. The main street was completely full of people and lots of people up on store front roof tops taking the show in. Didn't stay long as we thought the sound quality was garbage....which was expected...but was glad we made it over to experience it.
980199,dave524,2016-08-22 19:58:00,4508,They did the main street thing here as well and we don't even have a song named after us   
980272,RDR,2016-08-23 16:41:00,125,"Who knows Dave? Maybe they will dedicate a song to us ""Peach Pickers""  A festive atmosphere for sure!!! Kudos to those who put it on. Decent sound and visual had Main St. rocking pretty good! Nice to see the community come out and enjoy the event!!!"
980277,DRIFTER_016,2016-08-23 17:33:00,10439,"The Hip has quite a hold on us Buffalonians as well........saw them a few times. Last one was out in the pouring rain on the shores of Lake Erie. Little did i know that would be the last time.  I watched the CBC show, and many around me were welled up quite a few times. I was hoping to hear pigeon camera, but knew that probably wasnt going to happen with all the  other songs they had to get in. Hopefully he gets an extended stay with us and is one of the 10%'ers that can make it 5 years vs a number of months  A friend of mine in Alaska who is originally from Buffalo flew in to see one of the TO shows. I'm pretty sure he visited his family too."
980283,blaque,2016-08-23 19:20:00,2419," A friend of mine in Alaska who is originally from Buffalo flew in to see one of the TO shows. I'm pretty sure he visited his family too.  After flying cross country, I spose ya might as well take the hop, skip, and a jump down to poke ur head in the door while ur in the neighborhood lol"
980284,AKRISONER,2016-08-23 19:29:00,5558,would have loved to see them perform we'll go too...but whatever I still have fully completely to get me by.

980319,crappieperchhunter,2016-08-24 11:41:00,2582, Was that your drone flying around after 8:30 but before 9:30.?We saw the blue and red lights on it as we where walking up to check things out...but just before we got up to the street we stopped seeing it.
980619,Henricus,2016-08-29 03:04:00,118,"No, not mine but we also noticed it and just found it through Google."
980633,dave524,2016-08-29 12:59:00,4508,"If you want to put it on your Ipod , phone or portable device  http://bigozine2.com/roio/?p=3036"
980043,GBW,2016-08-20 23:20:00,8460,So tonight is the night that The Tragically Hip play one last set.  Live for all to see from Kingston!  I have seen them perform 3x in the past and I'm far from a fan but I think I'll be watching it in some way tonight. 
980044,SirCranksalot,2016-08-20 23:22:00,3291,The neighbor is having a 'concert party' tonite---I'll wander over with a beer in hand a little later.
980046,porkpie,2016-08-20 23:37:00,2521,"I'm not a music guy, but I've always liked the hip.  My shift ends at 8 and it's straight home for a rum and coke and the Hip!"
980047,GBW,2016-08-20 23:37:00,8460,The neighbor is having a 'concert party' tonite---I'll wander over with a beer in hand a little later. I bet many are having a 'concert party' across Canada
980048,SirCranksalot,2016-08-20 23:55:00,3291,I bet many are having a 'concert party' across Canada I bet there will be thousands of such parties. I would be interesting to hear a good guess as to the number tomorrow.
980050,Pigeontroller,2016-08-20 23:59:00,2793,I regret not ever having seen them perform...I bet I'm not the only one. Definitely watching tonight!

980062,leaf4,2016-08-21 02:58:00,2466,"Saw them once years ago, in Wiarton of all places. Never appreciated it then as much as I should've, went down to gage park in Hamilton to watch it with a couple thousand others, screens weren't as big as I expected they'd be so I shot home to continue it lol"
980076,FloatnFly,2016-08-21 14:06:00,1640,"its one thing to walk away on your own, its another to walk away because you are forced to, sad day in the music world.  wish i could have watched them live in person, but seeing them live on tv is the next best thing.  i've got recorded on pvr to watch again.  a good read http://www.cbcmusic.ca/posts/11589/the-true-tragic-and-inspiring-canadian-stories-beh"
980080,leaf4,2016-08-21 14:47:00,2466,"Good list, but where's 38 years old on it?"
980083,Jds63,2016-08-21 15:27:00,1365,It was  a great concert for sure ... Truly iconic Canadian band ... 35 songs last night ! Lots of memories playing their music on many canoe and fishing trips .
980087,Sinker,2016-08-21 15:44:00,8692,We played it in a buddies yard on big screen through our P.A System. 1800 watts of hip blasting. It was amazing!! When the show was over we broke out the guitars and jammed another 20 or so hip songs around the fire. Amazing night. Im surprised you couldnt hear us at your place GBW. It was LOUD!!!
980091,tb4me,2016-08-21 16:23:00,3295,"Great show..Wow just wow..Gordo was pushing real hard the first couple of songs, but after he relaxed his voice BOOM there it was. Not gonna lie I did shed a tear or 2. Man he sure likes Mr.Trudeau doesn't he..that was the best 3 hours of my summer right there.."
980099,GBW,2016-08-21 18:33:00,8460,"Amazing night. Im surprised you couldnt hear us at your place GBW. It was LOUD!!! I think I did!!!  Well, someone was having a 'show' last night close by"
980109,Beavertail,2016-08-21 20:49:00,331,"Watched the show at home with my wife and we were glued to the tv. Soaked up every moment, and loved it. We passed up some invites from friends for backyard viewings, I just didn't want any distractions to actually watching the performance. We were also lucky enough to see them at the London show, just 6 rows from the stage - I feel so lucky for the chance to see them one last time. For me last night, 'Boots or Hearts' really stood out, it sounds great live, and always gets the crowd bumping...I get goose bumps thinking about it."
980116,GBW,2016-08-21 21:43:00,8460,Here's a classy move! 
980117,muskymatt,2016-08-21 21:54:00,2608,"So lucky to have seen them 8 times. Went to the Ottawa show last Thursday as well. It was unbelievable!! It was without a doubt the best concert I have ever seen, emotions were through the roof."
980127,Spanky80,2016-08-21 22:42:00,152,"I tuned in after failing to get tickets to the Ottawa show, heard it was great, unfortunately I turned it off once the political crap began, ruined it for me."
980133,Pigeontroller,2016-08-22 00:19:00,2793,Lets not let the political crap ruin this thread...
980139,backbay,2016-08-22 01:54:00,773,"I went down to the Horseshoe Tavern here in Toronto to watch the show. They couldn't have fit another person in the place. It felt really special and I was floored that he could get through Fiddler's Green. The night ran the full gamut of emotions, for sure."
980141,GBW,2016-08-22 02:19:00,8460,"CBC says 11.7 million Canadians watched, listened to, or streamed at least part of last night's Tragically Hip concert in Kingston.  And don't think that counts all the people at the ""parties"" that took place.  I bet more than 11.7M people..."

980152,Ronzo,2016-08-22 12:30:00,124,"Also turned down a couple of invites to stay at home and watch it with my wife - Maybe I should've gone out, seemed to be a LOT of dust in my house getting in my eyes at various points. Very bittersweet. What an amazing gift to Canada from the band. What impressed me most was Gord's defiance whenever the subject of death came up in his lyrics. Watch him in 'Nautical Disaster' when he hits the 'it's not a deal nor a test nor a love....' line.  Like everyone, hoping that he gets to live another bunch of years, not just months. Also loved his message - be compassionate and care about all Canadians..."
980158,AKRISONER,2016-08-22 14:34:00,5558,"what a show...was even more cool because my best friend and the captain of my hockey team were constantly featured dancing, and at the very very end of the broadcast crying on national TV ahhaa. cant say i didnt get stuff in my eyes and a weird unexplainable clump in my own throat sitting in my living room.  Gord's a friggin legend."
