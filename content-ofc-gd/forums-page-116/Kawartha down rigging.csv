980564,captpierre,2016-08-28 14:48:00,2521,Saw a guy with scottys downrigging for walleye. Ever hear of that?
980566,leaf4,2016-08-28 14:57:00,2466,Maybe they didn't feel like spending on some deep swim baits? Lol seems odd...
980569,misfish,2016-08-28 16:10:00,29133,"They do it on Erie, in not so deep waters."
980577,Rizzo,2016-08-28 17:29:00,4754,sure. Gets you right to the depth you want...without having the guesswork of in-line weights! I was debating using dipsey divers for musky fishing when we were there a few weeks back but I never made it to the north end
980608,fishindevil,2016-08-28 22:44:00,6254,Yes I have downrigged many times for walleyes !!!! And in lakes other than the Great Lakes or quinte !!!!
980618,i2cool2fool,2016-08-29 02:43:00,349,I used walleye boards in July while at Stoney Lake and got interesting looks from the locals. ...and walleye.
980634,Sterling,2016-08-29 13:05:00,477,"I downrig Nipissing on the regular now, works great."
980692,Roy,2016-08-29 20:23:00,13728,"You're right, Roger (Rizzo). A lot of folks think that down riggers are only used to fish deep. But pros use them to get their offerings to the proper depths no matter how shallow or deep they want to go."
