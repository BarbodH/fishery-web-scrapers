980052,Dutch01,2016-08-21 00:36:00,1431,Who's watching? Who ya got? I'm hoping Diaz takes it again.
980054,Dan668,2016-08-21 01:04:00,1120,Diaz
980055,Dutch01,2016-08-21 01:17:00,1431,I sure hope so. Connor's head is too big already. He'll be insufferable if he wins!
980056,manitoubass2,2016-08-21 01:20:00,11391,Diaz  Great card all around!
980059,GBW,2016-08-21 01:50:00,8460,any web feeds for it?
980060,Dan668,2016-08-21 01:55:00,1120,"Through acestreams,  yes."
980063,leaf4,2016-08-21 03:00:00,2466,"I'm thinking Conor takes this one, he had the upper hand last match but gave up the choke, I think he'll be a bit more guarded with his offense this time and not go all out like he did before"
980065,Dutch01,2016-08-21 04:34:00,1431,"That was a pretty good fight, I have to hand it to Connor (even if it pains me),he backed up all his trash talk.  Anthony Johnson's KO was insane, looks like he'll get another shot at Cormier"
980070,leaf4,2016-08-21 11:55:00,2466,"Definitely a close one, great fight to watch though, both guys are relentless"
980166,FrankTheRabbit,2016-08-22 15:28:00,479,"Rumble Johnson has always been a classy guy and so fun to watch. Never puts another guy down, always stays professional and when he gets into the ring, it's all business. The dude is a beast! It was funny that they were able to do a replay of the entire fight lol.  Diaz & McGregor both have big heads. lol Despite the damage on Diaz's face, I thought he fought the better fight. That guy never stops, always moving forward. His cardio is top notch and the way he trains, no wonder he can easily go 5 rounds without getting tired. Connor just faded and resulted to running away. Despite fading away near the end of the 2nd round, gotta give him props for the take down defense.  Can't wait to see the next match to finish off the trilogy.  And to see that many bouncers in the beginning to keep them away from each other and then at the end of the fight, giving each other mutual respect...sounds kinda fishy. lol I'm wondering if the top brass at UFC told them to make the fight last 5 rounds to take away the bad press it's been getting lately...particularly with the Lesnar baggage and the lacklustre events of UFC 200. The DC vs Silva match was a joke! lol"
980167,Sterling,2016-08-22 15:46:00,477,I scored it the same as the judges. McG rounds 1-2-4. Could have easily gone to Nate had he taken it to the ground I think.
