Its been hot/humid as well, thats usually indicitive of an early and substantial hatch.  Kinda weird, just one of many things Ive noticed this year.  Also in cool/disturbing news, we stumbled across a massive collection of small jellyfish on a small lake near the lower manitou. Be interesting to find out what type, why and how they suddenly emerged?"

Be interesting to find out what type, why and how they suddenly emerged? the jellys my guess came from an aquarium...eek   less mayflys...more hungry fish...i aint complaining! To be honest though manitou, down on GB the mayflies basically explode around the end of June and then vanish. I never see them in the summer...maybe im just not observant enough? But usually i try pay close attention to this stuff, even more now since ive started fly fishing."

As for the jellies, possibly aqarium but it be from quite some diatance away lol.  The lake is 3 hours+ down bushroads and isnt heavely fished as its fairly hard to get into.  With the lakes we have not alot of anglers tourist or not are interested in portaging 3 times to get there lol.  Its a puddle of a lake too (some of these lakes you can paddle a 14"" tinny one side to the other in 15 or 20 mins"
