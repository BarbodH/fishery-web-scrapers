980325,canoecarrier,2016-08-24 12:49:00,54,"Just recently bought a nice little 300 fourtrax, the dealer wants $91 for front brake pads. Does that sound right? $85 each for front bearings. Considering ordering off of ebay and waiting for them as the prices as just crazy.  Any help is much appreciated,  Thanks in Advance."
980326,Fisherman,2016-08-24 12:53:00,7201,You can get a lot of aftermarket parts that work just as well. Bearing can be had through places like Canada Bearing. Pads can be had at Royal distributing for $23. http://www.royaldistributing.com/Catalogues/Main/2016-Spring-Fall/#196/z

You have aftermarket, but the prices aren't much better I found and I'd prefer the genuine Honda qualify for a bike that age.  This bike had been through hell and back, and still runs like a champ. I can't get over how well built they are. Plus their resale is amazing."
