979884,Dara,2016-08-18 13:36:00,3052,Finally got out with my daughter for a couple days of fishing last week.    In 3 days we fished 11 hours and picked up about 75 of these babies. Including 13 double headers.  my daughter got the biggest of the trip at 18 lbs    And I ran into this old OFNer sitting across the dinner table from me.    Seems I ended up there at the same time as he was doing his free trip

979892,SirCranksalot,2016-08-18 14:23:00,3291,"Who is that guy with the Canadian flag?? Looks familiar somehow!!  ( ""got into some lake trout"" he said Well, that's a classic understatement. 75 trout---that's about 25 years worth on Simcoe! )"
979894,Dara,2016-08-18 14:50:00,3052,It seems Great Slave Lake has as good a fishing as they say it does

979900,Dara,2016-08-18 16:56:00,3052,Just don't ever recommend North Star Adventures...what a bunch of losers.  http://northstaradventures.ca/
979903,jimmer,2016-08-18 17:34:00,2730,So many of us dream for a trip like that. Thanks for sharing.
979905,Joeytier,2016-08-18 17:46:00,3990,"Amazing!  I was gonna say, if you were getting that many in that size range close to home you're doing something right lol"
979911,misfish,2016-08-18 20:55:00,29133,Those are real nice lakers dude.  Looks like someones gained a few pounds.LOL  Great pics.
979933,chris.brock,2016-08-19 02:11:00,4053, Very cool father/ daughter get away. Probably some good bonding time up there on that legendary lake.  Did you guys fish pike at all? Is that Borger guy an A hole or is he alright? Pretty small world.
979949,Dara,2016-08-19 12:28:00,3052,"Mike seems like a pretty decent guy...sure likes to fish.  The trip was actually a 30/60 birthday thing for us...4 days apart and they made her a cake while we were there Thanks to the staff at Frontier Lodge  And no, we didn't go for pike...eewwww"
979960,SirCranksalot,2016-08-19 18:46:00,3291,"Is that Borger guy an A hole or is he alright?   Udunno. Waddya tink?? Maybe we should vote on it, or do a poll??"
979997,Freshtrax,2016-08-20 03:49:00,2215,"Those fish look so slender and muscular,   Not like the gross blobs of laker we get down on Lake Ontario.   Nice going."
980009,Old Ironmaker,2016-08-20 09:31:00,8243,Hammer time! That lake is on my bucket list. Way to go CPP member.
