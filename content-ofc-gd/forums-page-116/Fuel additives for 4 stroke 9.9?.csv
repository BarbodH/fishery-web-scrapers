Remove and discard the fuel filter, take a new filter and fill with fogging mixture and install filter on the fuel pump. Disconnect the fuel line at the engine fuel pump (or both if you have two containers of the mixture). Run engines on the storage mixture for approximately 10 minutes at 1500 RPM. This will ensure that all fuel system and internal engine components are thoroughly protected. Shut off engine before the storage mixture is used up.  cheers peter"

979957,Big Cliff,2016-08-19 18:14:00,6899,"Isn't it funny; people go buy fuel with ethanol in it then go buy Sea Foam to counter the effects of the ethanol. Seafoam contains 10-20% IPA (Isopropyl Alcohol) which absorbs water allowing your engine to burn the water out of your fuel (simpler solution don't put water in your fuel)!  Seafoam is most noted for removing/reducing carbon deposits; Simpler solution make sure your engine is properly tuned up and you won't have to keep adding Seafoam to remove carbon deposits that shouldn't be there.  Seafoam will help to dissolve the varnish deposits left behind by ethanol (if it can get to them); Simpler solution, don't use ethanol products!"
979961,Old Ironmaker,2016-08-19 18:46:00,8243,"I have to laugh when someone buys Sea Foam or some other ""tune up in a bottle"" and expects it will make an engine that has mechanical problems to run like new."

979985,ecmilley,2016-08-19 23:13:00,2163,What fuel u running in your new motor tj? If your running the cheap stuff i recommend using startron fuel treatment great stuff for corn fuel. the non corn fuelnstuff then seafoam or a.good stabilizer boats tend to sit most of the time and stabilizers are the first line of defence. Picking up a motor tomorrow for a rebuild thought usingnlast years fuel untreated was a good idea scorched 2 pistons
979828,Tjames09,2016-08-18 00:40:00,664,I was able to locate a good price on a newer 4 stroke 9.9. I was wondering if you guys use any fuel additives for your 4 strokes.
979830,Tom McCutcheon,2016-08-18 00:51:00,627,"The only additive I use is Stabill.  1/ Stabill marine all season long to combat the ethanol in most regular octane gasolines. I know I could use Shell Gold or whatever it is without the ethanol, but there is still a chance of moisture gaining access to the fuel at some point.  2/ Stabill marine storage additive for the winter layup."
979831,Joeytier,2016-08-18 01:05:00,3990,"Always high test!  I will also add Stabil in any tank that I think I won't use up in a week, as well as seafoam every few tanks."
979832,Old Ironmaker,2016-08-18 01:07:00,8243,When you are talking about a minimal amount of fuel for the year on a 9.9 won't break the bank so use hi octane fuel only. Most if not all hi test fuel does not contain Ethanol. Adding an additive like Stabil or 2 plus 4 will not harm anything. We are talking a few bucks a tank. 2 bucks difference for a 29 litre tank at 10 cents more a litre for the good stuff. A Tim Hortons coffee.
979834,DRIFTER_016,2016-08-18 01:30:00,10439,Stabil goes in all my marine and small engine equipment every time. I also use Mercury Quickleen Engine and Fuel System Cleaner a couple of times a year in my marine engines.
979836,Raf,2016-08-18 01:58:00,3495,"on a 9.9, unless the motor is layed up for extended periods of time (stabil) i wouldn't bother.  go fishing then dump the remaining fuel in your portable tank into your vehicle.  even on my 40, i only use stabil for the winter layup to stabilize any fuel in the engine. any unused fuel in the tank after a trip goes into a vehicle."
979838,chris.brock,2016-08-18 02:13:00,4053, I don't bother with an additive until it's the last run of the season.  I do buy ethanol free premium gas for everything except my daily driving vehicle. I also squirt the first couple liters of premium into my vehicle before filling the tank for toys and tools.
979840,Fisherman,2016-08-18 02:32:00,7201,"Nothing but Seafoam, end of the season, the tank, the fuel line and fuel lines under the cowl get drained along with either the carbs or FI system.  Had a bad experience with Stabil one year, it turned into jello at the bottom of the gerry can, never used it since and I've never had to get any of the engine fuel systems worked on.  No ethanol gas is also on my list.  There are a handful of stations that still have regular no ethanol available."
979843,Old Ironmaker,2016-08-18 02:48:00,8243,Not good. I use 2 plus 4. I have Seafoam but the writing on the bottle is so small I can't read the instructions. How much per litre do we use Fisherman?

979855,glen,2016-08-18 04:11:00,2641,Had my boat at the dock.  First few days it starts good. Then hard to start.  Next trip stabili in gas now start good all the time.  What's a new starter cost or being stuck on the lake.  I use stabil all the time now.  Funny how we got away from mixing oil in the gas and now we have to use stabil.
979861,Old Ironmaker,2016-08-18 05:48:00,8243,"Shell's V Power= zero ethanol.  We have to use a phase separator now because gas never had ethanol in the old days, just lead. We always used Sunoco  because we pretended our 1.8 litre MGB's were British Ferrari's. A 2000 pound car that went over 100MPH felt like it too. With twin ANSA or Peko exhausts it just sounded like it. A little over 130 HP I think.  I found a list of ethanol free gas in Ont  Shell Pro V Canadian Tire 91 Costco 91 Ultramar 91"

979871,porkpie,2016-08-18 10:42:00,2521,"I like seafoam, I use it a couple times a season, but mostly I just buy shell premium and I don't have any problems."

Ive used it on my lawn mower, I didnt find it did anything. My lawn mower doesnt run the greatest anymore, so I tried to help it out with some seafoam, but I found it made no difference. I even sprayed it in the intake while it was running, got those nice clouds of smoke."
979874,DanD,2016-08-18 11:27:00,2223,"Seafoam is a cleaner, conditioner and a stabilizer; it cannot fix a mechanical or carburetion issue. If there is some form of dirt in a carb's fuel passageway, then a lot of times the seafoam will clean it out. But if an air bleed is plugged with dirt, seafoam won't help you because the treated fuel doesn't go through an air bleed; only in coming air does. Been a mechanic for close to 40 years now and have never believed in the snake oil fuel and engine treatments; but seafoam does seem to do all it claims it can. I always have at least one case of the stuff on the shelf here at the shop; we go through a lot of it.  Dan."
979875,Big Cliff,2016-08-18 11:29:00,6899,"Simple, use hi test and no additives at all! Drain your tank and lines at the end of the season and put them away in a clean dry place, you'll never have a problem!  As for spraying Sea Foam or anything else into the intake while an engine is running; it might help clean out a bit of carbon but it isn't going to do any good at all as far as solving a carb problem."
979878,fishindevil,2016-08-18 12:16:00,6254,"well its a no brainer it will not fix mechanical problems like dan said,but it does what its supposed to do,and yes always run good gas"

I was totally skeptical about how well seafoam works, but on my old 91 suzuki it literally changed the motor from one that misfired and didnt idle well even after cleaning the carb, to a brand new smoothly running one pull motor.  Im a believer"
979882,LeXXington,2016-08-18 13:32:00,1928,Seafoam and only Shell Vpower if I can.  You never know when life gets busy put that stuff in and no worries.

No need for stabil, just use seafoam.  The only 4 stroke I have is my riding mower, and I don't do anything, just turn key and go.....same with my vehicle.  S."
