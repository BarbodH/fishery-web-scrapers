Then up to Stratford to hang out for a bit since I've never been there either.  Pretty much anywhere I go I have to do a little fishing. I'm targeting bass and pike.  This is the route I'm taking:  https://www.google.ca/maps/dir/Oakville,+ON/Saint+Marys,+ON/Stratford,+ON/@43.2402325,-80.5225289,10.13z/data=!4m22!4m21!1m5!1m1!1s0x882b5b8b8f729979:0x5037b28c7231bd0!2m2!1d-79.6876659!2d43.467517!1m5!1m1!1s0x882eb8f546f42cc7:0xc938a742f71d92d5!2m2!1d-81.140653!2d43.2595868!1m5!1m1!1s0x882eadf991b497b3:0x5037b28c7231dd0!2m2!1d-80.9822286!2d43.3700007!2m1!2b1!3e0   I once fished and trolled on the Grand out of Brant CA. Any other put-ins on the Grand north of Brantford you would recommend at this time of the year, especially after this hot, dry summer?  Never been to the Nith. Would anywhere on there be worth fishing at all right now by boat? Or would I have to settle for shore fishing?  I have been to Pittock in Woodstock and Fanshawe in London. Don't like those reservoirs and it seems like Wildwood is much the same based on google satellite view. I actually wouldn't have minded checking Wildwood out but I'd want to be at the east end where it's quieter but doesn't look like there's a launch there.  As for shore fishing, how productive could the Thames in St. Marys, ""Lake Victoria"" in Stratford or Nith in New Hamburg be?  Hell I might even be open to fishing for carp.  If PM would be better, I'd appreciate a message. Thanks for any suggestions. "
