980740,Can_38,2016-08-30 14:29:00,152,I'll be in NS in a few weeks to visit family.  The cottage sits on a unique piece of property where the ocean is 200 yards from the back door and a fresh water lake is 200 yards from the front door.  I know no license is required for ocean fishing (doubtful to catch anything anyways) but how do I go about obtaining a week pass for the fresh water?

980743,AKRISONER,2016-08-30 14:45:00,5558,i would double check your claim about not requiring a license for ocean fishing...in British Columbia licenses are required for all salt water fishing. They are issued by the federal government.

They are issued by the federal government. Cut / Pasted directly from the link provided above from Drifter_016  Salt-water fishing:  You do not need a licence to fish in tidal or salt water in Nova Scotia.  However, you must respect Canadian federal fishing seasons and bag limits. See  Additional Information,  below."

980855,Sinker,2016-09-01 05:17:00,8692,"I wouldnt even bother with fresh water if your that close to the salt. Salt water is always better. Any local wharf will have something to catch. Lots of mackeral, and maybe even a striper if your in the rifht area. Salt rules!"
