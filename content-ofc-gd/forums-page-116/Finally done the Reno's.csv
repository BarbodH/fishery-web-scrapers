Rondec is what it's called Im a tile setter by trade. I have been using the full line of Schluter products for almost 15 years now. I remember having to wait for my supplier to get stuff in from Germany, now the stuff is made in Montreal.  They have singe handedly reinvented the tile industry. Now everyone else has copied their products cause they work so well."
