792500,big guy,2013-06-13 23:47:00,414,"Oh yes, the white one Misfish is talking about, perch, fire tiger, they are all good, but the best one I have personally used is the crawdad, followed by the white one"
792519,Rich Nelson,2013-06-14 02:14:00,332," I wasn't referring to Big O. Simply saying that I'm willing to pay a bit more for something that I know produces, and have confidence in."
792523,big guy,2013-06-14 02:27:00,414,"My apologies then, I obviously read your post the wrong way, or it could have been my many reminders to my kids to get ready for school."
792530,Tim Mills,2013-06-14 03:36:00,476,"Agree that Cotton Cordell crank baits  are good value.  Big o crayfish is the most productive lure when we fish the bass openner around gananoque, perch pattern also very effective.  Big o 3 pack for $9.99 at SAIL 1 white, 1 crayfish, 1 perch.   I don't see very competitve prices at the CTC,s in my area."
792554,wkimwes,2013-06-14 14:03:00,76,"I find that it is cheaper to get most of my tackle or lures at the three local tackles shops I frequent.  CDN Tire and even Wal Mart I find the prices to be usually .50 to 2 more, not everything though, I can get Power Pro Braid Super Slick at Wal Mart for 3 dollar cheaper, but thats the only good deal I see."
792555,wkimwes,2013-06-14 14:05:00,76,"Cotton Cordell is a quality lure company.  I use the Big O crankbaits in a few colors and like the super spots too.  Never tried a live target craw, thanks for the tip."
792558,jbailey,2013-06-14 14:33:00,866,"how about rick clunn lures haha $22+ although i don't mind because a specific lure i picked up turned out to be probably the most productive lure i've owned over the last 5-6 years. Even after being annihilated by pike it stays in tact for future use and have quality hooks.. i find xraps puncture easy and become waterlogged or do not swim correctly, although i still like them. I used to be furious that the lure cost so much but it was definitely worth it.. but it is now off the market unfortunately as of last year.."
792275,davey buoy,2013-06-12 19:48:00,5505,"Checking stock at canadian tire,looks like these crayfish are now $13.99,with tax $15.80 WOW. This lure has caught a lot of fish and really do want to replace it. Anyone no of another brand that may work just as well/better in there experiance?.If so wouldn't mind getting one/two. Live target is getting expensive.It caught large Pike,Bass,crappie,perch etc.Will bite the bullet if needed,just curious about alternatives?.Thanks."
792279,lew,2013-06-12 20:00:00,12766, You better stay away from musky fish'n
792281,bare foot wader,2013-06-12 20:08:00,1354,"can't say I've ever tossed the live target crawfish, but their jerkbaits work great for me  I've always done well for smallmouth on the rebel crawfish  http://www.basspro.com/Rebel-Crawfish/product/2952/"
792282,davey buoy,2013-06-12 20:14:00,5505,"Lew I have bought /own 9 musky baits lol. This crayfish is only 2-3"" long.I can by a musky killer for that price or bulldog.Just trying to justify.  .The prices have gone through the roof.Argueably,the best all around lure though for me."
792285,aplumma,2013-06-12 20:32:00,6896,I have tried others but they don't have the same wiggle. Sorry to say.   Art
792289,Fang,2013-06-12 20:52:00,1330,"Fill up at the CDN Tire gas bar when they give out 10X CT money as a reward. After a few fill ups you'll be able to walk in and get a free one with CT money.  They've ""given"" me a ton of free lures over the last few years just for gassing up my truck"
792290,davey buoy,2013-06-12 20:59:00,5505,"That's how I buy most of my fishing stuff.I fill everyday,so the multipler is great. Might cost me three bucks this week out of my own pocket,but looking to see if anything else is close to or as good?"
792291,davey buoy,2013-06-12 21:03:00,5505,"Thanks Art,that's what I'm thinking as well.Will not be without one though if they are the best."
792295,aplumma,2013-06-12 21:47:00,6896,Dave I have used lots of lures over the years and some are left forgotten in the stack of boxes never to fulfill the promises they lured me in with. I have assembled a bag that is my grab and go bag and it has lures that are time proven for different styles of fishing. The bass bag has an assortment of lures from topwater to dragging worms    that will produce all year long at a local private lake. The topwater lures are the green frog and the mouse from live target. The crawfish lure is very productive used in a jigging manner and it has a vertical fall that drives the fish nuts. I recently added a new lure made by mega bass that is a topwater that has an action that is awesome. It is expensive though but check Ebay some of the sellers seem to get them at a reduced price. My spinnerbait selection is mainly white and chrome since it seems to be the prefered color. I round out the mid level of the water column with the white bandit 4-6ft model. The bottom is shakey rigs with senco's and 10 inch worms. While there are many different lures to fall in love with you will find the few ones that are must haves and the live target is one of them in my book.  Art
792297,davey buoy,2013-06-12 21:52:00,5505,"Thanks again,i can see a replacement tomorrow, What can you do. You are right about the money we all spend on tackle,but really there is only a handfull or so that seem to work most times for most of us."
792298,misfish,2013-06-12 21:52:00,29133,"You see it,s true. Lures dont only catch fish,but catch the fisherman. LOL  THESE DAYS,YA GOT TO TAKE A MORTGAGE OUT TO BUY A BAG OF TACKLE."
792299,davey buoy,2013-06-12 21:56:00,5505,"Your right as well,have you seen the rapala prices lately?.Fathers day is coming  ."
792300,spincast,2013-06-12 21:58:00,3279,"I've had a lot of success with the Rebel crayfish. A real deal at 7.99 for a few inches of plastic with hooks  , but I can't say how it fishes compared to the live target one.  I struggle to pay their prices, even with the CTC cash"
792305,misfish,2013-06-12 22:17:00,29133,Dew worms are FREE.
792329,big guy,2013-06-13 00:59:00,414,"Big O crawdad, damn killer lure and quite cheap"
792332,Rich Nelson,2013-06-13 01:42:00,332,"I would rather spend the extra few bucks on a quality lure that has proven itself, that try to replace it with cheaper crap."

792379,big guy,2013-06-13 11:42:00,414,"Is this post an intended shot at purchasing a Big O? If so, have you ever tried one? They are by Cotton Cordell, who make quality lures.  The big O crawdad has caught me countless bass, many walleye and even a couple of Muskie."
792380,fish_fishburn,2013-06-13 11:43:00,1311,"Was in crappy tire yesterday checking out the crankbaits. Your right the prices are bordering ridiculous. I guess as long as we keep buying them the prices will keep increasing. My issue with the higher prices is were not getting a better made product most of the time to justify the cost. One of my favorite trolling cranks is the Rapala Taildancer. I probably have ten and half of them the finish is coming off in chunks the size of a dime after being used only a few times.  Over the last two years I have been using Reef Runner cranks and have about  twenty five different ones. There only eight bucks each and I have had zero issues with the finish staying on them. The problem with them is that probably half of them dont run properly out of the box and have to be hand tuned to get them working right. I guess thats the price you pay for a cheaper lure. But I will tell you that they catch big eyes and Northerns for me on the Ottawa River and BOQ where I use them the most. Needless to say I left Crappy empty handed yesterday, I can get more for my money at my local independent tackle shop. Crappy Tire is definitely not passing their buying power back to the customer. I would say they are twenty percent more expensive then anywhere else in my area at least."
792453,davey buoy,2013-06-13 19:02:00,5505,"Even my smokin joe is losing paint,great bait in the 3/8 size.Ridiculous is right.If I'm buying a bulldog,musky Killer etc for a couple bucks more at best,the 2"" crayfish,I don't get it."
792454,davey buoy,2013-06-13 19:03:00,5505,"Will grab one,what colour works for you best.Thanks"

792463,big guy,2013-06-13 20:22:00,414,"Crawdad, it looks likes a crayfish"
792464,davey buoy,2013-06-13 20:23:00,5505,Is there not different colors?
