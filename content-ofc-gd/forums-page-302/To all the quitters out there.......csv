791954,jbailey,2013-06-11 13:41:00,866,"Good stuff! I quit smoking a year ago yesterday! Fishing is a good alternative, but possibly more expensive  haha"
791955,Rod Caster,2013-06-11 13:50:00,5784,"I'm in limbo right now. Don't smoke during the week (which is difficult) but still go back to old ways on weekends...beer, canoes, fishing, it's just such a part of who/what i am. Since I consider myself of low-willpower when it comes to quitting, I'm quite happy that I can go 4 or 5 days at time and not smash everything I own. Its a good start. Best I've done in any of my ""attempts"""
791966,motv8tr,2013-06-11 14:33:00,2587,"Good on all of you....I think I've been smoke free for about three years now...but honestly, can't say for sure...could be 2 or could be 4...i wasn't really paying attention  Maureen"
791967,BITEME,2013-06-11 14:33:00,1968,Well I guess I will get in on this I didnt want to jinx myself before but I have been smoke free for a 100 days as of Saturday WOHOO!!!!!!!!  Its paying for Max  Cheers Peter
791972,lew,2013-06-11 14:59:00,12766,"22 years ago I went on a health kick and gave up smoking, booze, coffee and sugar, all cold turkey, then got seriously into mountain biking and ended up with nearly $3000 invested in a bike and rode 5-40 miles everyday for years, spring, summer, fall & winter  I was lucky and never gave a 2nd thought to the booze, smokes or sugar, but giving up coffee really bothered me. I went to see my doctor about it and she said not to worry about it, because the smokes were the big one and go back to coffee if I wanted.  And 2 years ago I also gave up salt.  Still off all the bad stuff, but no longer riding and still loving my coffee.  "
792022,TJQ,2013-06-11 18:11:00,7806,"  LOL.. I'm glad I never started smoking, but i know how hard it can be from watching friends and family, not being able to quit.  It took my mother from us 17 years ago this July.  Comgrats! to all quitters."
792063,bubbles,2013-06-11 20:04:00,591,"The wife tells me it's been 4 years, I will believe her.  Best decision I made, to be honest it was easy once the prices got out of control."

790788,limeyangler,2013-06-06 11:18:00,5204,"Morning all,  2yrs ago today i quit cigarettes and today also marks the day 18 years ago that drugs and alcohol ceased to control my life.  I have a much healthier addiction these days (fishing) which, the gods permitting....i will enjoy for longer than i would have if i'd continued with my more destructive, compulsive behaviours.  So....if you are also proud to be a quitter...give yourself a standing ovation and a shout out on this post....who knows....it might just encourage someone else to be a quitter too   Have a great day   Simon."

Coming up on 10 years smoke free living.  Tough, tough habit to quit... and quit... and quit... and make stick."
791173,manitoubass2,2013-06-07 22:42:00,11391,"Time for me to put on my big boy undies and become a quitter.  I always hated smoking. Made fun of all my friends etc that smoked...  Then, being the genius that I am, decided to light up at the early age of 25 (I'm now 33).  The second worst decision I've made in my life."
