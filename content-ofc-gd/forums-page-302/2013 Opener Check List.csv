792077,esoxansteel,2013-06-11 20:19:00,1307,"Plug and tetherswitch installed or you wont be going to far, bring double 10s, glides, topwaters, sledges, jakes cause who would want to fish for bait anyways, unless its walleye which taste soooo damn good."
792083,Freshtrax,2013-06-11 20:35:00,2215,Put plug in transom
792091,JoshS,2013-06-11 20:56:00,729," Ha! When I first got my boat less than two seasons ago, my first trip I packed everything but my new boat keys! Now I keep a few sets of spares in my car and tackle."
792098,Old Ironmaker,2013-06-11 21:18:00,8243,"Keys are very important and putting in the plug would be good. I found out this year my spare key does not work, try the spare key."
792105,lew,2013-06-11 22:28:00,12766,"Be sure the lug wrench for your truck wheels will also fit the lug nuts on your boat trailer, cause their not all the same size.  And before the season starts, also be sure the lug nuts aren't seized on so tight you can't loosen them."
792140,Sinker,2013-06-12 01:00:00,8692,Such an important thing that many overlook!  S.
792171,Pigeontroller,2013-06-12 03:24:00,2793,Glad I live near the Empire state! Been fishng them since early May!  
792192,fishindevil,2013-06-12 07:24:00,6254,Another thing that gets overlooked guys is your fire extinguisher !!!!!!! Make sure the powder inside has not gone hard and make sure the gauge is still saying full !!!!!! They do only have a limited life !!!!!!!!!! I know that not all boats are requires to have one but I have always had in in all my boats .......as well always have a few spare fuses for electronics like graphs livewells and marine radios ....... Great list guys.    Cheers
792193,Stoty,2013-06-12 08:11:00,2910," Absolutely!!! Came in handy a few season back when (during a tournament) we noticed a cruising yacht was SMOKING.... pulled up the Minn Kota and shot over to the boat.... he couldnt get his working, so I grabbed mine, jumped into his boat and put it out for him. I can only imagine how that might have gone if there wasn't a working extinguisher around....."
792194,fishindevil,2013-06-12 08:12:00,6254,Nice spring smallie by the way Dax !!!!
792210,Sinker,2013-06-12 12:46:00,8692,Btw......opener was weeks ago. You should all have this sorted out by now
792377,pike slayer,2013-06-13 11:26:00,1177,"ya keys are always good.that reminds me 5-6 years ago my buddy and i were going to head out ice fishing so the night before i brought my sled over and loaded the sleds in the trailer so we can just jump in the truck and go the next day. so we got up early and took off. did the hour and a half drive and we parked where we unload the sleds. i asked my buddy for the key and he goes digging all thru his truck looking for it and he goes ooooo i forgot your keys on my nightstand......do you know how to hot wire your sled!??! and i was like ummmm no i cant say i've ever tried to steal my own sled before. so long story short, i pulled my dash apart and disconnected the wires and got it going."
