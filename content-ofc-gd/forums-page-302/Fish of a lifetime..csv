791574,Freshtrax,2013-06-10 02:41:00,2215,"Well for everyone that says you need to spend tons of money to have fun fishing I proved you wrong.  My new boat    Hull: 150$ New transom floor and carpet: 150$ Motor, waterpump thermostat : 300$ Rod holders 50$ Stainless hardware 100$  Total cost 750$  Clocked on GPS at 28 mph before it got squirlley with lots of throttle left.  Need a prop change to get the bow up a little while on plane.  We hit  kempenfelt on on sat. For lakers to no avail. But did a nice tour from line 2 oro into downtown barrie and back to test the boat.   Sunday I took my brother and sister out for perch and had a blast.      I know it's just a perch but what a tank . The pics don't seem to do it justice it had been in the cooler for 3 hours.  I have never caught one this big and probably won't again."
791581,Musky or Specks,2013-06-10 03:02:00,2710,That wee lad makes that perch look gargantuan
791585,kickingfrog,2013-06-10 03:39:00,8333,That is a great perch.
791608,HTHM,2013-06-10 11:28:00,4082,"Nice rig! You may want to move the trailer licence plate over, the cops may ticket you for a plate not being visible as the motor is ""blocking""it."
791614,solopaddler,2013-06-10 11:56:00,8605,"Nothing wrong with that boat all, I'm sure it'll serve your purposes well. And yeah, that's a huge perch alright!"
791618,mattyk,2013-06-10 12:06:00,2110,That is a big perch!
791647,Rich,2013-06-10 13:58:00,3927,"Beauty, a truest of true jumbo!"
791653,Dave Bailey,2013-06-10 14:14:00,1641,"If it floats, it's a boat! Nice job on those perch, looks like you and the young ones had a blast."
791656,fishnsled,2013-06-10 14:24:00,3520,Nice perch!!   Nothing wrong with that boat and nice to see the fish like it too.
791676,Old Ironmaker,2013-06-10 15:36:00,8243,"I love the boat, after all it's a Starcraft! I'll give you a pass on the F 150."
791834,Freshtrax,2013-06-11 00:45:00,2215,Thanks guys I was just having fun with the topic title.  I wish it was a PB trout or pike but I will take what I can get.
791836,grt1,2013-06-11 00:50:00,638,nice job every inch counts for team 7
792539,Stoty,2013-06-14 09:56:00,2910,"Holy TANK of a perch! That's a beauty! Looks dont matter, if it does the job that's all that counts.    "
792545,kipdouglas,2013-06-14 12:09:00,18,looks like a great day.
792548,BLOO KANOO,2013-06-14 12:51:00,20,The perfect boat is the one that works best for you. Nice Perch! I bet the kids had a great day.
792550,jedimaster,2013-06-14 12:58:00,3472,I would take the boat over the ford. Haha. Nice perch.
792551,TJQ,2013-06-14 13:00:00,7806,  That gigantic perch makes that little man look small!  hahahahahahaha
792569,mistaredone,2013-06-14 17:16:00,913,Not sure if it's your first boat but trailer bearings are critical if your towing it around. Definatly something to look at and cheap to replace if you DIY.  I came close to learning the hard way on my first year of boat ownership.  Congrats on the new rig and nice fish.
792585,The Urban Fisherman,2013-06-14 19:20:00,2050,"Awesome boat!  Sure beats my first rig - awesome fish to, congrats on the PB!"
792606,Dave Bailey,2013-06-14 21:52:00,1641, A buddy and I have a running joke that the first sure sign of spring is when you see a vehicle on the side of the highway with a wheel missing off the boat trailer.
792618,Freshtrax,2013-06-14 22:52:00,2215,Learned my lesson with the snowmobile trailer when I was younger....now I carry a spare trailer tire for all my trailers.  The upfront 100 dollars or so is nothing compared to the agrivation of leaving a trailer full of snow machines on the side of the highway while you head 1.5 hours each way to the closest tire shoppe
