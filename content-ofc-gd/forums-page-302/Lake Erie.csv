791485,Pickeral eater,2013-06-09 21:30:00,155,"Hey guys!! just wondering how other members are making out on Lake Erie for walleye?? Spent a few evenings trolling, bottom bouncing with crawler harnesses and have been skunked every time out. Just wondering if anyone else has had any luck? I'm fishing 40-50 fow out from pt abino. Thanks Bill"
791496,krixxer,2013-06-09 22:03:00,274,"I'd also like to know the secret to Erie walleye, the have managed to elude me for the last few years."
791511,HTHM,2013-06-09 22:53:00,4082,As far as I'm concerned there are NO pickereyes in Lake Erie or the Grand.
791544,outllaw,2013-06-10 00:28:00,1232,western basin. if ya do it right you can have 50 fish days.
791561,monterey guy,2013-06-10 01:40:00,12,had good luck at port maitland also mohawk point 40 to 60 fow 30 ft down using flicker shads with snap on weights
791572,krixxer,2013-06-10 02:28:00,274,I trolled around Crystal for a few hours today but again no luck.  We were in 40 to 50 ft speed was around 2kmh. We dragged a worm rig and near the bottom and various baits in the 20-30 ft range.  It’s been 3 years that I pulled a walleye out of Erie. I have no problem with bass or perch even the odd pike but walleye? If it were not for all the pictures I wouldn’t believe they are in there.
791607,F7Firecat,2013-06-10 11:27:00,347,"little early yet for walleyes out there.....maybe not, I know come july aug and sept they are very plentiful out there"
791610,Rich,2013-06-10 11:48:00,3927,40-50 ft is perch water..
791621,krixxer,2013-06-10 12:28:00,274,keep it in the 20-30 ft range?
791626,Freshtrax,2013-06-10 12:36:00,2215,.
791627,Rich,2013-06-10 12:37:00,3927,"More like 70-80, at least on long point bay. Only successful times were when we marked them thick in 70+ and drifted harnesses through... Its tough to find a calm enough day to do that. Most guys are running dipsys and riggers to get em out there.  Different parts of the lake may vary, I know they are much shallower in the western basin..."
791633,Pickeral eater,2013-06-10 12:52:00,155,"Thanks guys. I was wondering if I was doing something wrong. With the boat docked in the upper Niagara, western basin isn't an option at the moment. Keep on trying I guess! Thanks for everyones input.  Bill"
791636,Roy,2013-06-10 13:06:00,13728,"Bear in mind that if you'll be taking fish from deeper than about 35', be prepared to keep them."
791664,OhioFisherman,2013-06-10 14:56:00,6623,"It seems a bit early in the year to have to fish deeper than that for walleye. It's been a long time since I fished, and it was restricted mostly to the western basin of Lake Erie for Walleye which supposedly warms faster, but before the 4th of July 30 feet or less was where they were.  I would catch them burning a rattle trap or Sonar in 3 - 6 feet of water searching for smallies near rocky shores of the western erie islands."
791671,Old Ironmaker,2013-06-10 15:23:00,8243,"A very serious walleye guy that lives here on the north shore won't think about going out for them until the end of July at the earliest. Then it's downriggers and planner boards and occasionally dipsys. And they go deep, 80 feet. I have been told they are in the western basin and migrate to this end in July. Ted says looking for them now is going for a ride in the boat.  The odd Grand River fish can be had this time of year, and when lucky can limit out when everything is perfect. There are definitely walleye in the Grand, catching them is another story. Just this past April I personally saw a container full of 5 pounders at Riverside Marina taken from below the dam at Dunnville that were being relocated to above the dam by a local fish club."
791917,Rich,2013-06-11 10:12:00,3927,They must go shallow at night. This is the first year I've heard in a long time the pier fishermen are getting the odd one at dawn while perch fishing.
791924,Pickeral eater,2013-06-11 11:21:00,155,Was wondering the same.  Warmer waters and chasing bait fish possibly?
791989,Sinker,2013-06-11 16:05:00,8692,"I know nothing about erie, but I heard there were some eyes getting caught off point peelee.  S."
792117,krixxer,2013-06-11 23:07:00,274,I wish I was better at fishing walleye.
