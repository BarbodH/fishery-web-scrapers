792011,Scott S,2013-06-11 17:43:00,203,"I need help with my boat. It's a 2007 crestliner fishhawk with side console. Just recently I have noticed that my toggle switches that run my livewell, bilge etc are coming on in the off position. Does anyone know what I can do to fix this problem. Right now I'm  just unhooking my battery so I don't drain the battery. Any information is greatly appreciated. Thanks Scott"

792286,Scott S,2013-06-12 20:33:00,203,Thanks Davey Buoy. I had it apart there is a lot of wires!!. Been looking where I could get the toggles replaced that will fit the same?
792301,aplumma,2013-06-12 22:02:00,6896,You have a hot wire touching a circuit that is in a loop ground configuration. Unplug the wires after marking them from one switch at a time and isolate the terminals with tape. Use an amp meter between the positive terminal inline with the power feedline and when you disconnect the fault the amp draw will drop to zero. Isolate the circuit and test for a grounded wire. Any false grounds need to be repaired and then the circuit retested after being hooked up again for amp draw. Switches are the place to start so ohm them out before going after the wire harness.
