Lady said my ""front end is falling off""... Whatever that means... Lol  Took it for a second opinion.... $1500 total work needed....  Call autozone in NY state.... $877 in Ontario for parts... $350 in NY state!!!!!!!  So I went from $3000+ at a ""big name"" garage to about $1000 at a small no name family owned garage that's been in town for 42 years...  I'm glad I got a second opinion... And glad NY state is a 5 minute drive...  Pays to shop around..."

792591,Ainsley,2013-06-14 19:46:00,142,I pick up car parts from the US pretty often.  I have a 2004 subaru forester and do all my own work on it.  In the past two months I've spent about 300 on parts and fluids that would have been quite a bit more if I'd purchased here. Mobil 1 full synthetic is ridiculously more expensive here.
