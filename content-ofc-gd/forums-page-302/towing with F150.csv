791949,ld17,2013-06-11 13:30:00,319,"Hi Guys, I recently bought a used 2005 F150 4x4.  I will be towing a 19.5 foot bass boat.  Should I tow with overdrive off or on.  Just wondering what other do?  Thanks"
791953,jedimaster,2013-06-11 13:40:00,3472,"More than likely od off will be the best on your transmission, Whats your truck rated for and what is the weight of the boat? I find if I am near half of the towing capacity the od stays off. Most manuals will tell you to shut the od off. Actually most newer trucks will have a tow/haul button that will change the shift points and keep the od disabled."
791960,bdox,2013-06-11 14:10:00,329,"Unless you're on flat terrain at highway speeds, it's best to keep it out of OD. Not sure if you have a tow/haul button, but if you do and you're exceeding 50% of the GCWR it helps to use it, otherwise the longer shifts are annoying."
791964,fish_fishburn,2013-06-11 14:24:00,1311,"I have a 2000 f150 4x4, and tow a bassboat. On any hills I hit the button to turn od off and when on flat terrain or going down hills I turn it back on."
791973,Rich Clemens,2013-06-11 15:00:00,3131,"I've had a couple F-150's and have always trailered with OD OFF. Even once I get up into Canada, where the terrain is failry level, I still leave it off. I think my owners manually recommends this any time I am pulling a trailer."
791978,BillM,2013-06-11 15:15:00,17367,"If it's fairly flat, leaving it in OD isn't a big deal (Just keep an eye on the tach, any rpm wandering take it out of OD)..  If it's hilly, OD off for sure."
791995,Muskieman,2013-06-11 16:14:00,2472,"I tow a 9000lb 30' RV with my 2000 Expedition , OD off while climbing , and OD on flat terrain , transmission still works like new ( and I have a performance tuner ) ."
791996,BillM,2013-06-11 16:27:00,17367,"I just put the Duramax into D and it does the rest.. 5th wheel, 5th wheel + boat, doesn't matter, lol."
791999,Luke V.,2013-06-11 16:32:00,286,Bill we do the same! DMAX all the way.  Hauled 12000 lbs with her last week lol  But like others have said. If tow/haul is an option in your truck. Use it while hauling the boat. Does the truck have the 5.4 triton? Or 5.0? Either way. Truck will handle the boat no problem. Turn OD off before hills  Increasing your speed 5-10 km/hr at the bottom of a hill will also help you.  Have fun fishing!  Luke
792233,ld17,2013-06-12 14:45:00,319,"Thanks guys, I'll keep an eye on the rpms and see how it hauls with OD on and off.  Definetly off on hills."
792261,aplumma,2013-06-12 18:21:00,6896,The secret to the question is what is the transmission temperature. Keeping it below 210 degrees will prevent the fluids from becoming acidic/breaking down and damaging the transmission. A truck with the tow package has a tran and oil cooler along with a few other goodies to keep the load in check. I run a 2012 ecoboost 12 hours straight doing 75 mph with a 20ft Ranger and a weeks worth of gear without an issue reaching 198 F degrees in the mountains. My Titan was at 210 and I had to lock out overdrive before I even got close to the mountains and it did not have a tow package.   Art
792263,Sinker,2013-06-12 18:38:00,8692,"If your tranny is constantly searching for gears, drop it into OD.  S."
792306,bdox,2013-06-12 22:21:00,329,"When a transmission is ""searching"" for gears, it's because the RPMs are too low for the current gear and road speed, so it downshifts looking for higher RPMs. Putting it into D (also known as OD, the highest gear, lowest RPMs while cruising) doesn't solve that, it causes it."
792323,Sinker,2013-06-12 23:42:00,8692,"Oops, that's what I meant. That should have read drop it into D.  If its searching for gears, drop down a gear.  S."
792330,Fisherman,2013-06-13 01:10:00,7201,"Now if you drove a Cummins with an oar, you just put it in 6th and forgetaboutdit, mickey mouse exlax"
792343,Old Ironmaker,2013-06-13 03:01:00,8243,"I got into the habit as soon as I start the truck while hauling I hit the tow button, switching OD off. I will hit it again if merging onto traffic if need be, but off when Towing, always. I had 500K on the old GMC with original tranny and that beast towed car trailers for years and always had it on D2, hills or no hills. I watched my RPM closely and saw no difference on the highway. I think selecting OD off is a good habit to get in."
