792229,SirCranksalot,2013-06-12 14:29:00,3291,"Nice fish and nice pix. Congrats on getting published. So I guess we could say that Bill took the pic but Mike...er...um....had a hand in it.    I read the OC article. Out of curiosity, did you travel and fish with Ken. B and Dave K, or did they just happen to be on the river at the same time?"
792230,LeXXington,2013-06-12 14:33:00,1928,excellent
792347,farsider,2013-06-13 03:11:00,456,"Nice shots. Well done sir! Hope this translates into more opportunities for you. Cheers, Mark"
792362,Cudz,2013-06-13 05:38:00,2652,That is a nice pic for sure. One thing I can't figure out though.  Maybe you can help me Bill.  I went to the Shoppers' drug mart on Essa to get a copy of Outdoor Canada and they were all sold out. Weird

792481,davey buoy,2013-06-13 21:42:00,5505,That's a side of Bill i didn't want to know lolol.That just aint right!
791867,BillM,2013-06-11 02:08:00,17367,After our Sutton trip last  year I have been in contact with Ken Bailey the senior hunting editor of Outdoor Canada about the possibility of a few of my pics making it into his article.  Well got a nice surprise while in Shoppers Drugmart tonight!  I thought maybe a small pic etc but didn't expect a page and a half spread!  To say I'm excited is an understatement!   There's also a pic on the inside cover and 2 other pics in the article itself...  Hopefully I can sneak into a few other magazine as well.    Here's the original.
