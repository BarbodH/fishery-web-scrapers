792219,shimano19,2013-06-12 13:35:00,196,How do you guys find these back lakes? are they just hit and miss or word of mouth?
792253,Lunkerhunter,2013-06-12 16:50:00,455,rich im pretty certain the OP lives in quebec. not haliburton
792292,Rich,2013-06-12 21:05:00,3927,Lol. I dont even know where I got haliburton from. Wow. Just knocked down a whole nother level of stupid.
792324,Freshtrax,2013-06-13 00:03:00,2215,There's a lake  near massey same story ..some idiot brought a cooler full of live pike in... Used to be a trophy speck. Lake.     He got drunk and running at the mouth around the campfire about it my buddy almost killed him that night.
792371,Stoty,2013-06-13 09:38:00,2910," I can def vouch for that, first hand! Some TANKS in there..."
792402,Gallie,2013-06-13 13:17:00,1215,Nice gator man!
791510,Fishing 24/7,2013-06-09 22:51:00,709,Explored many new lakes this year for trout.   rumours had it locals put in some pike in a speckled trout lake.   fished it for specks and got my line cut off a couple of times.   went back today with the big guns.   landed tons of pike they took over the lake.  and i landed this brute had a head of a MULE!  
791513,Joey,2013-06-09 22:58:00,9122,"Yup, that's a mule alright.  Wonder why someone would introduce Pike to that lake??  Probably not many specs left"
791515,Dontcryformejanhrdina,2013-06-09 23:03:00,535,Some people are idiots.  Great catch though!
791523,MCTFisher9120,2013-06-09 23:28:00,3761,"Very nice gator, sucks when other species take over but when they do catch em!"
791525,SirCranksalot,2013-06-09 23:30:00,3291,Must have eaten lots of specks to get that big!
791531,kickingfrog,2013-06-09 23:40:00,8333,"I am not a fan of people taking wildlife management into their own hands, but sometimes some pike can help a lake that has a stunted population of fish. Don't know if this is the case here, but if you do end up finding the brookies they might average bigger then they used to."
791547,Walleye'm Fishing,2013-06-10 00:45:00,310,"Wow, wasting a speck lake on pike. Now that's not too swift. So... did you throw that gator in the bush?"
791548,Rizzo,2013-06-10 00:54:00,4754,"aren't there enough lakes with pike in them already? Sheesh (big fish though, nice catch)"
791565,Tim Mills,2013-06-10 01:46:00,476,"Too bad about the specs but hell of a pike, I'd be interested to hear some details on the catch, lure water depth etc"
791617,solopaddler,2013-06-10 12:05:00,8605,"Huge snake man, awesome! Along a similar note in the last 15 years or so pike have infiltrated Booth lake in Algonquin Park, a deep cold lake trout/brook trout lake. Biologists have studied these pike and have determined they're among the fastest growing ever on record. Fatty soft finned forage makes for some big pike."
791619,Rich,2013-06-10 12:07:00,3927,There was never specks there. The locals dont know a rock bass from a laker.
791628,msp,2013-06-10 12:39:00,1336,Nice fish That is a DONKEY !
791771,Fishing 24/7,2013-06-10 21:30:00,709,yeah man it was a speck lake they used to pay to stock them everyyear.   more info about the pike ?   i was fishing the bay where the wind was pushing. and i found a hump passed a point. shallow about 7 FPW in rocks .  there no weeds in the lake becasue its a speck lake.  crystal clear lake. i was fishing with huge lures . m/g     swim baits.   1  1/4 onze spnner bait.  then i swtiched to a crank bait. silver bleu.  i said to my self if there not goign to hit this i dont know what to do. second cast. aimming toward the middle of the lake.  he took it deep . but didnt hit any vital organs. his gills were mint. fought like a boss.  lasted 2-3 minutes then he was netted.  kept him in the water removed the hook took somwe quick pictures.  revived the fish a little bit . no back a forth motion just holding it slightly by the tail .  it kicked hard a fooded us both and we laughed hard then i started to cast again.  the end
791785,bigbuck,2013-06-10 22:21:00,2449,Nice gator!!!
791788,mattyk,2013-06-10 22:23:00,2110,Nice looking fish!
791794,Fisherpete,2013-06-10 22:41:00,1814,Beauty of a pike!
791835,buick14,2013-06-11 00:47:00,741,Cut that thing open and fish its stomach for brookies  Nice fish btw
791840,Fishing 24/7,2013-06-11 00:59:00,709,  DUDE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  youv got a strange mind and i love it i actually took 2 minutes and imagined that scenerio.  i was awesome thanks!
791852,SirCranksalot,2013-06-11 01:27:00,3291,1 reason not to do that and let him go free is the hope that maybe whoever put the pike in there would go skinny dipping there 1 day when the pike are hitting on worms!
791856,Rich,2013-06-11 01:43:00,3927,"Pretty sure my grandfather's cottage is directly to your right about a half klick. Could be wrong but it sure looks like a familiar shoreline.  If so, yes they paid to stock all sorts of things, collectively, over the years. Lakers, specks, bows, walleye.. the only fish that ever stuck were rock bass, LM and SM. til Chester put the pike in.  Everyone knows Chester did it. just ask the cottagers."
791859,Rich,2013-06-11 01:46:00,3927,PS: That is a BEAST!!
791862,glen,2013-06-11 01:51:00,2641,Nice pike dood.  If rich is right he sure knows his shoreline.
791987,Joeytier,2013-06-11 15:54:00,3990,Hahaha no kidding.  I can think of about 400 similar looking shorelines
792053,Fishing 24/7,2013-06-11 19:42:00,709,  impossible for a couple of reason...  0 cottage  0 eyes  only pike n maybe some rare specks  i dont know chester  its cot a collective thing.  on the right in more shore with 2 FOW  and theres no grandpa within 45 miles!
792070,Rich,2013-06-11 20:13:00,3927,"Okay.  Said I could be wrong.  The story sounds identical to the haliburton lake I'm thinking of, as does that shoreline. I honestly pulled a pic out of an album last night of me holding a smallie in what looks like the exact same spot, to a freakin tee! But, shorelines can obviously look quite similar in haliburton back lakes.  Either way, as I said, thats a BEAST!  Chester's a fat american who loves pike, and is responsible for their introduction/destruction of a few Haliburton lakes. Biggest one being Kushog.  I wish I knew that arse's last name. He moved a few years back. Never seen him since."
