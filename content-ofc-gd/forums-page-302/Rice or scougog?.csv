791278,shimano19,2013-06-08 17:41:00,196,"Went up to buckhorn lake today to do some musky fishing, slow day..had 1 follow and that's it. Talked to other anglers and nothing at all. I want to go to rice or scougog for skis and fish some walleye aswell. any news on those lakes this season?"
791314,linweir,2013-06-08 22:28:00,202,"Go north to Lower buckhorn lake. Tones of Muskie.  Between Rice and Scugog, I think you have better chance to catch muskie on Scugog."
791411,leaf4,2013-06-09 14:53:00,2466,"Scugog for muskie, I was there the long weekend, out near the red buoy I heard there was walleye (very weedy only about 8-12 feet of water) and I ended up pulling in 2 muskie 40"" and 52"" too bad it was before they were open! regardless it was a fun day."
791431,Rich Nelson,2013-06-09 17:19:00,332,Definately Scugog. Way better numbers of Musky.
791437,BLOO KANOO,2013-06-09 17:55:00,20,If your looking for Pickeral. Rice lake has been producing very well so far this year. I don't know about the Muskie fishing.
791577,Stoty,2013-06-10 02:51:00,2910,Rice Lake for both. The Otonabee River is FULL of Musky and the lake has been on fire for Walleye for the past 3 weeks. Always a few break offs from Musky each time I'm out on Rice while Walleye/Bass fishing.
791584,Dan668,2013-06-10 03:13:00,1120,"I was out today on Rice, action was pretty slow. Managed a few walleye all in the slot. Musky id hit scugog instead."
791652,shimano19,2013-06-10 14:13:00,196,"So I ended up going to rice to fish some walleye, it was pretty slow for us, we were ripping bucktail jigs on the weed lines, tossing jerk baits and did some drifting with jigs and minnow. Only caught on bucktail jigs. Fun day on the water but no impressive numbers."
791668,nexstar,2013-06-10 15:09:00,63,Better than Scugog.. The walleyes are far and few there but I have seen lots of musky being caught at Scugog  .  I know people are catching their limits of walleye on Rice this year. They all catch them at the weed edge
791905,Stoty,2013-06-11 09:03:00,2910,"Scugog is a waste of time for Walleye compared to Rice. This past weekend was the slowest of the season so far, but still managed to get a limit of nice 16-19"" eaters!"
791988,Sinker,2013-06-11 16:03:00,8692,"Eyes were on fire on friday evening on rice, but saturday it was tough. We still managed a 2 man limit of keepers, but had to work for them.  I haven't seen a musky there yet though.  S."
792151,Dutch,2013-06-12 01:36:00,831,"Stoty hit the nail on the head.  Fish the O for muskies, then make a run down to Rice for some eyes at the mouth of the river."
