Happy with that, he next started to hand line the hook end of the outfit and found himself in a battle with a huge pike. He did manage to hand line it. 46"", and released."

792320,BassMan11,2013-06-12 23:25:00,583,2 odd ones.  A telephone line off the bottom of the lake. Was able to pull it up to the boat and unhook it.  In Florida last December I was fishing for bass in a small pond I accidentally snagged about a 3 foot gator. Thankfully he got off after about 30 seconds. Not sure what would have happened if I would of got her in.

792345,Cudz,2013-06-13 03:08:00,2652,When I lived in Australia I caught a lobster in a river (maybe it was a huge crayfish) I hae a picture of it somewhere I caught several knot eels (these things tie themselves in a knot when you bring them onboard.. really weird!) I caught a 7-8ft marlin on a 5 inch frozen pilchard.  I obvioulsly did not land it on my 7ft medium action spinning rod rigged with 12 pound test. I also caught a duck.  That was a good fight as it went airborn. The duck atually broke me off so I never landed it. My buddy also hooked a Merganser while fishing topwater at night.  Crazy fight but I managed to get the hook free.

792536,fishindevil,2013-06-14 07:59:00,6254,Yes I have also caught carp while trolling worm harnesses as well as lots of big channel cats in the Ottawa !!!!!! Have even caught whitefish while trolling harnesses as well and once when I was running a salmon charter boat I had a big planner board out about 100ft off the side and didn't know it then but there was a picnic table floating right side up about 6inches under the surface and the board went right overtop of it and all the line and lure got tangled up in the table !!!!! what the hell.   That was fun .... But we got everything back !!!!! Good job it was just trolling would not have wanted to hit that at speed !!!!!!! Always lots of things to watch out for .....
792580,JoshS,2013-06-14 18:50:00,729,"A garbage bag puts up a great fight on a windy day!  When I was young fishing with my Dad one night I was casting off minnows like crazy. I was going through our bait stash fast and my dad was getting a little ticked off so the last minnow I cast off, I acted like nothing happened and left the hook out there empty. I reeled in awhile later and found a small fish around 4in hooked through the top lip perfectly which stayed on the hook forever after that. Thought that was crazy when I was younger, still find it funny.  Other than that hooked a few anchors, one or two old rods, snagged line with salmon and trout on them and released them, snapping turtle, loon chasing baits to the boat (still fretting the day one eats it), seagulls on topwater, once broke off a little crazy pike on a husky jerk and caught it the next day. One year in the spring I started hitting a few bullheads on gliding raps over this weed bed which I found a bit weird considering the size of the lure, and didn't know the lake had them."
792181,northernpike56,2013-06-12 05:55:00,717,"Laying in bed playing on my phone right now and thought this would be a funny question to ask on here: What are some of your 'weird' incidental catches while fishing that you basically reel them in and think how in the hell..? They can be anything, weird fish, other animals, or garbage/stuff that was thrown into the water. Here are my top 5: 1. I caught a cheap fishing rod combo one time fishing in hamilton harbor. 2. Snapping turtle. (Multiple times) 3. Canada goose that went suicidal and actually ate my lure 4. 3 ft long watersnake 5. 10 inch long smallmouth bass that ate an 8 inch long sucker minnow rigged for pike.  I have also caught quite a few seagulls as those things are completely stupid and will actually divebomb into the lake to grab lures like rapalas and livetarget."
792187,fishindevil,2013-06-12 06:44:00,6254,My best catch was on one of my homemade worm harnesses I caught a small 16inch walleye on the first hook and about a 3 lb pike on the second hook !!!!! The pike was trying to snatch the walleye off the hook and he got hooked himself. As well !!!! I have caught a few boat anchors as well as an old net and my gf caught a rock with a hole in it !!!!!! Yes it's true !!!!! And we both have trolled our lures along the bottom and caught many big fresh water clams ..... She also caught a Canadian flag at the bottom of the Ottawa river and while casting her new lure from the dock I'm about 3feet of water snagged a baby sturgeon by the end of the tail about a 5lb  it was not harmed !!!!!! And that's just the ones I can think about. !!!!!!! There is more......
792190,John Bacon,2013-06-12 06:59:00,3277,"I have caught flies while fishing (not fly fishing though).  They landed on my spool and got wrapped up in line when I reeled in... happened twice.  I caught a half digested dead perch once.  I figure it must have been in the throat of another fish that hit and got away leaving the perch behind.  I did feel a definite hit so I didn't just snag it off the bottom.  I have also caught snails, rocks, fishing lures, anchors, etc.  I had double header with a large mouth and a small mouth on a Rat'l Spot.  I almost had a salmon on two rods earlier this year.  I hooked in on an inline planer board.  I reeled in right up to the boat before it broke my line, the line tangle on my dipsy rod and I was able reel right back to the boat before it finally got free."

This one flies away. Happy ending though, finally brought him in and unhooked it's beak. 2) Hooked a water snake... hard to unhook that one as well. 3) got an old boot in frenchman's bay. 4) hooked a bag of dog poop in frenchman's bay (they really like to throw things in there eh)"
792211,Sinker,2013-06-12 12:48:00,8692,Caught a condom in oshawa creek one time. It must have been caught up in one of the shopping carts. I cut the line quick on that one!  S.
792216,craigdritchie,2013-06-12 13:22:00,1586," I know a guy who caught a condom off the mouth of the Humber River one day, while casting Cleos for salmon. He cut the line too, and I think I would do the same. Yech.  Many years ago I saw a guy at the Old Mill Dam hook a dog. The dog wasn't hurt, fortunately, as the hook just got wrapped in its tail fur while the guy was trying to cast. But it was funny watching this guy in floppy rubber waders chasing a golden retriever down the river bank yelling ""dog on!""  Strange catches for myself ....  1. Turtle, on a jerkbait while muskie fishing. 2. Dead, badly decomposed salmon that I somehow lined with a float and roe bag while fishing off the pier at Port Hope. 3. Gull, which hit a topwater while I was picking out a backlash. 4. Landing net (nice one, I still have it)"

Bowfin dogfish whatever off spinnerbait middle of lake.  Funniest thing happened when I used to work at a bait store in Hamilton and frogs were sellable back then.
