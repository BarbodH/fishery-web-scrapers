792667,lew,2013-06-15 11:56:00,12766,If there's a Metal Supermarket around you they'll have whatever you want in aluminum. Can't offer anything on the plastic though.
792670,aplumma,2013-06-15 12:49:00,6896,The local car stereo installer shop might have what you need. Unfortunately I have what you need but the drive back and forth will cost to much. lol
