792046,Old Ironmaker,2013-06-11 19:29:00,8243,"May I ask what is the difference between 2/ 12 volts in parallel vs. in series? And what is the proper wiring for both. I'm the guy that needs an electrician to change the batteries in my flashlight! I might not have it correctly done. This would be for my 24 volt MotorGuide trolling motor which isn't performing correctly. What is the proper method, parallel or in series?  Installed 2 new deep cycle batteries and the unit isn't responding as it should be. It might be time to put a new hood ornament on the wish list.  While I'm at it what is the proper charging procedure, what battery does the charger hook up to, does it mater ? I have a smart charger set for 5 amps I believe. Don't have the charger with me today to check positively. One of my usual suspects says they should be disconnected and charged individually. I never have."
792051,Angler management,2013-06-11 19:39:00,280,You will probably get the best info from watching it on youtube. Probably easier to understand then reading about it when it comes to wiring diagrams. Series vs. parallel wiring will determine whether you are getting 12v or 24v.

792055,Angler management,2013-06-11 19:44:00,280,"To get the 24v. Run a positive wire from your motor to one battery, and negative to the other battery. Then using a jumper cable, connect the remaining two terminals from both batteries( one positive and one negative) to each-other."
792056,Jigs,2013-06-11 19:47:00,136,"From what I know, and correct me if I'm wrong, but with a parallel connection you basically beef up your 12 volt battery. Giving a higher Amperes per hour outpout. That's two batteries connected negative to negative and positive to positive.  With a series connection you turn 2 12 volts into 1 24 volt battery. That's two batteries connected positive to negative.  You can use 2 12 volts in parallel to run say a 12 volt motor but don't use  2 12 volts in series for a 12 volt motor or you can fry it.  At least that's my basic understanding.  Like Angler M said there are videos on youtube that explain this.  You can also do a google image search for diagrams and such."
792059,davey buoy,2013-06-11 19:51:00,5505,Terry's schematic is bang on!Pretty easy to follow I would think.
792060,Roy,2013-06-11 19:52:00,13728,"Just use Terry's diagram,,,it's correct."
792064,Old Ironmaker,2013-06-11 20:05:00,8243,"Thanks all, I went to do the dishes and bang, 6 replies. You are all the best. I have it wired as in Terry's second diagram. Engine positive to battery 1, engine negative to battery 2. Jumper from battery 1 negative to battery 2 positive. Correct? I charge red charger to red on battery 1 and black charger to black on battery 2, yes?"
792065,Angler management,2013-06-11 20:10:00,280,My smart charger will not work unless i disconnect and charge separately...
792067,Fisherman,2013-06-11 20:11:00,7201,"No, unless you have a 24 volt charger which I doubt you have.  Either use a 2 bank charger which has 2 blacks and 2 reds, one set goes to each battery or use you single 12volt charger one one battery at a time, no need to undo the other wiring."
792086,Lape0019,2013-06-11 20:43:00,647,"Yep, your charging is your problem then. As stated above, either buy a 2 bank charger or charge one at a time. No need to disconnect with most chargers. Just put red to positive and black to negative on the same battery."
792097,Old Ironmaker,2013-06-11 21:15:00,8243,"I do charge each separately without disconnecting, a new hood ornament may be in order when the budget allows.  Thanks all."
792121,beagle dad,2013-06-11 23:31:00,224,you sure straight 24 volt motorguide or 12/24 volt
