792278,maybo,2013-06-12 19:55:00,86,"Want to replace many of my front trebles on my cranks with red ones but do not want to buy the hooks and am hoping I can dye or paint them red instead. Any alternatives to buying new red hooks? How would a red permananet marker work, red nail polish, blade dip dye,,,,has anyone tried any of these alternatives,,,,if so how has the color held up on the hook?"
792284,bare foot wader,2013-06-12 20:20:00,1354,"you can buy an air gun for fairly cheap, home depot probably, look at model building shops  can't really say I've noticed any difference/increase in bits with red hooks"
792287,kickingfrog,2013-06-12 20:37:00,8333,I thought we were done with that red hook thing.
792294,adempsey,2013-06-12 21:33:00,1498,"I've painted jig heads and home made panfishing ice jigs with nail polish + clear coat.  Worked great and stands up quite well.  Not sure how it would do on a hook, but no harm in trying (as long as you don't cover the points).  Could always try a red piece of plastic, fur, feather or bead instead too."
792296,aplumma,2013-06-12 21:51:00,6896,The paint will cause the barb on the hook to be ineffective. You can try using a red sharpie it is thin enough it would not affect the hook do it's job. Personally I would add a slash of red to the lure before I would tint the hooks.    Art

792353,HTHM,2013-06-13 03:48:00,4082,Don't be so cheap and buy the red hooks....They are made of stronger steel and will last longer. I am a firm believer in spending my money once.
792378,Rich,2013-06-13 11:34:00,3927,"All I know is I painted the front hook on my favourite Jitterbug red with nail polish once. I left the barbs exposed and painted the rest so as not to dull it.  Now it has a red, sharp hook. Oh , and it hasn't caught a fish ever since."
792414,JoshS,2013-06-13 14:12:00,729,"I always take the red hooks off baits that come with them and replace with black. I don't know why, guess it's a confidence thing and I just don't like the look of them haha. Don't think it makes a difference 99% of the time."
792436,grimsbylander,2013-06-13 17:01:00,3016,I've only changed to red hooks twice and both times needed bandaids.
792456,Sinker,2013-06-13 19:17:00,8692,"The only plus to red hooks is they don't rust. The colour makes no difference. Once you catch a pile of fish on them they turn gold, and you still catch fish!  Its nice that they don't rust though!  S."
