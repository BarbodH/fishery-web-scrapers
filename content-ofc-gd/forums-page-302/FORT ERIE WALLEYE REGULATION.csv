792506,Pickeral eater,2013-06-14 00:54:00,155,There are some closed spots along FE  but ud have to check exact dates and locations with mnr. There is no slot and 6 fish limit if that helps
792510,CRAPPIE,2013-06-14 01:23:00,213,Thanks for reply.  What rig should I use since the area I am fishing is a little strange. In front of me is little current but further out is very fast current . What rig should I use?  Thanks again
