792409,fishhard,2013-06-13 13:47:00,6,I just found out I have to work on Saturday. Anybody like to take my spot as observer for bluffers tightlines tournament? Pays $75 or you can go salmon fishing on a charter for free on the Friday with some of best salmon guys around. You have to attend meeting fri night at bluffs and be at bluffs sat mrng 515 am and off water by 3pm. You will learn a lot of salmon info for sure.
