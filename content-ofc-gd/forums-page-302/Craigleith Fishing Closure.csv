There's an access area right off the highway that a lot of rainbow anglers use spring, fall and winter for ""surf casting"" to catch the elusive bows.  During the summer the area is used by swimmers that sometimes can't afford the cost to go for a day pass next over inthe provincial park.  MTO who owns the shorefront has arbitrarily closed this off, citing some things like too much garbage and doing a study for highway improvement.  Baloney.  They just trying to screw the land based or mobility impaired angler out of one of the very few accessable spots.  There's been some noise on TV and calling the local reps.   Ther's also a link that provides access to the generic petition,  we need the support.  Thanks for reading. http://www.change.org/petitions/stop-the-closure-of-shale-beach"
