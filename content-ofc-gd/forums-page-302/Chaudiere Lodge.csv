As for it being easy to catch fish I don't know if I would go as far as to say that. Especially if you haven't been there before. There is a lot of water to cover and with all the back bays it can be easy to get lost. The good news is, is that Steve and his crew want you to catch fish and they usually have ""fish talks"" in the main lodge every night with Steve and there guide. Accommodations were great and boat rentals adequate. I found that a lot of the time Steve and his guides were blowing up to Nip. but unless you have your own boat and a decent size motor that can be a time consuming ride with the boats and motors they rent out. We stuck around the camp within 5 km or so fishing bass. There is no doubt that there are fish there. The difficulty will be finding them, you will be there around prime time muskie season and there are some brutes. Hopefully your there for a week which will allow you more time to learn the water. Good luck !"
