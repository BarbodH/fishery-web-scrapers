792566,Dan668,2013-06-14 16:56:00,1120,Anyone here insure their tackle?
792567,Old Ironmaker,2013-06-14 16:57:00,8243,Mine is covered under my homeowners policy. I have a photo of each tray and all tackle in case of loss.
792570,beagle dad,2013-06-14 17:26:00,224,homeowners covered mine as well make sure you take pic of rods tackle etc of all items unbelieveable how fast it adds up
792576,JoshS,2013-06-14 18:18:00,729,"I got renters insurance which covers it, mainly for that reason!"
792579,jedimaster,2013-06-14 18:50:00,3472,My van got stolen about 10 years ago with a tackle box and a rod in it and it got replaced under the homeowners.
792587,Dan668,2013-06-14 19:32:00,1120,"Ok going to look into it. Is their a company that will insure it outside of home owners insurance? Just wondering because that my parents policy, not that it matters, wouldn't want my claims raising their rates."
792592,Terry,2013-06-14 19:57:00,14456,"I just insured my tackle and rods with the company that is insuring my boat, they wanted me to insure with homeowners . as did all the other companies I contacted, but they agreed to insure for $5000.00  value well I don't have it yet  boat sure be here next week (delayed again) and I don't know the name of the insurance company, can't remember if he told me but this is the broker who quoted the insurance  Tupling Insurance Brokers Ltd198 Holland St. East,Box #10,Bradford Ontario L3Z2A7(905)775-3379"
792608,aplumma,2013-06-14 22:07:00,6896,"I have tackle riders on the boats. It will replace up to $5,000.oo per incident. The company is US Boats so I am not sure it will help you up North.   Art"
792612,bare foot wader,2013-06-14 22:31:00,1354,"yep, insure my tackle among almost everything else too, only takes 1 unfortunate incident to learn ya....my boat policy covers theft from my boat, docked, trailered/parked while on the road or parked at my residence...up to 10K, it was the number i asked for and no questions asked...includes all tackle and electronics  I do keep electronic copies of my receipts for big purchases as well as a photo inventory of almost everything  my boat insurance for the year cost 846 but that includes ocean/fraser river coverage  my tenant insurance covers theft up to 30K from my truck, NOT including my mountain bike, to insure a 5K bike would cost almost 1K alone...LOL  that tenant policy covers laptop, cameras, firearms (as long as legally transported ie restricted only to and from the range) other hunting gear, optics, snowboard, clothing, etc  few buddies think i'm nuts, but considering the one loss i experienced, i feel a bit better now for minimal dollars spent"
792659,fishindevil,2013-06-15 08:30:00,6254,"It's definitely something people only think about after a theft or a loss !!!! And yes it's a great thing to have specially when the average rapala can be $10-15 man in just a few trays I would have $1,000 it's mind boggling that's for sure  !!!! Take pics of everything and documents. Good ideas !!! Tight-lines"
792662,pics,2013-06-15 09:59:00,1268,"Wow, with a mortgage, 2 vehicles on the road, and a daughter, I couldn't possibly afford more insurance than what I have...lol."
792668,Rod Caster,2013-06-15 12:33:00,5784,"Thinking the same thing, Pics. I wouldn't purchase any special ""tackle"" insurance unless you get a fuzzy feeling by being over-insured. Your possessions are covered automatically under homeowners, unless specifically written otherwise ...even if the equipment if off-property, ie, in the boat, in car.  Taking photos are keeping receipts/records is the best approach...and check your possessions limit, basic policy cover around 25,000.00, which adds up quick when you own couch, bed, dressers, fishing gear, guitars, canoes etc etc."
792669,aplumma,2013-06-15 12:45:00,6896,"It is not so much that it is over insured it is making sure you have the correct insurance and enough insurance to cover the situation when you make a claim. In most cases homeowner insurance does not cover tackle stored in the boat or if the boat is stored off site such as a marina. They also do not cover any items removed from a commercial use vehicle. The best way to know if what you have is correct is sit down with the agent till you have answers to all of your questions because knowing ""before"" a claim is the best way to purchase the correct type/amount of insurance.

792674,musky_hunter,2013-06-15 14:04:00,328,Losing a box of my jerkbaits would be about $1500+. Have to start taking some pics of my tackle for insurance.
792678,Dontcryformejanhrdina,2013-06-15 16:02:00,535,This thread has inspired me to finally get around to taking pictures of all my tackle/gear. Did a quick tally in my head.....I should lay off buying new stuff for a while lol. I can't imagine what some of you guys must have invested in tackle. Insurance is pretty necessary.
792681,Dan668,2013-06-15 16:44:00,1120,"When I tallied up all my gear, that made me want to get insurance, Even for some of the cases of lures, shocking how much I spend."
792683,capt_hooked,2013-06-15 17:05:00,212,Too much tackle...!!!
792684,jedimaster,2013-06-15 18:23:00,3472,"Yah, I spent the entire morning to try and consolodate my bass lures. So far its not going well."
