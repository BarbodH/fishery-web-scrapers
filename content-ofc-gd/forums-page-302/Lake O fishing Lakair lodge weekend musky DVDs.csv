788938,Handlebarz,2013-05-28 21:25:00,3790,Hey all the auction has started we dont have alot up but we have  a few new things coming here is the link for the facebook page.  https://www.facebook.com/groups/368150206543129/594334723924675/?notif_t=group_activity  For all you that dont know about this its just a auction my wife and I started last year to help raise money for teh Fish-A-thon for a cure. We had trouble getting people to just donate cash so we thought we would try this last year was a crazy over whelming auction we started with two or three thigns and it went crazy. This year we are late with all our crazy family life taking place but we have got it going now. Please check it out and feel free to bid or donate if you have something there is no such thing as a small donation as 100% goes to the Fish-A-Thon.  I will try and get up all the p[ictures and update the prices here like I did last year.  Thanks for all the support that the OFC comunity has given to Fish-A-Thon for a cure. Big thanks to all that run it there is a long list so im not going to start to name names just show up and see for your self its a great time.
