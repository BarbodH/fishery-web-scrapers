792042,gburdzin,2013-06-11 19:13:00,32,Anyone know of where I could find this onboard battery watering system locally?  http://www.basspro.com/FlowRite-QwikFill-Onboard-Battery-Watering-System/product/52557/  Last time I checked with BassPro here they didn't carry it (which is very annoying actually).  My batteries are a real PITA to get to for keeping the water levels topped up.  Thanks Greg

792136,Fisherman,2013-06-12 00:47:00,7201,Total Battery also carries them.
792141,Dutch,2013-06-12 01:10:00,831,I think a better question might be why do you need to add water so often?  I've litterally had to add water to my batt's once and by that time they were 5 years old and were about to be replaced anyway.  Are they old batteries ?  Might just be time for new ones.
792144,Terry,2013-06-12 01:12:00,14456,I add water twice a year
792152,vance,2013-06-12 01:47:00,719,"We used to have a similar system on our electric lift trucks at work only on a larger scale,every so often one of the fill valves would stick open and over fill the cell .Battery acid does wonderful things to what ever it touches and the smell is enough to make you faint.I cant imagine the damage that can be done to a boat..  vance"
792208,gburdzin,2013-06-12 12:41:00,32,"Thanks for the replies.  I don't have to fill the batteries very often (I check them twice a year, spring and fall and usually only have to add a little bit to each cell), but they are a real pain to get to on my boat, and I was looking to make life easier in the future.  Greg"
792262,aplumma,2013-06-12 18:23:00,6896,The auto fill units asking for a leak and acid damage..... Manual checking will also alert you to an issue before it starts a fire or worse.   Art
