792107,aplumma,2013-06-11 22:36:00,6896,Sorry I installed the rod buckles and after 5 years they are working fine. The cutting is easy and since you are installing a quality product you should not have to worry about what to do with the future holes.   Art
792114,boombap,2013-06-11 22:56:00,310,I use the velcro ones from bass pro.  All they take is four 3/4inch screws that are included.. Screw them down to the deck and no problems.
792122,hirk,2013-06-11 23:38:00,571,"the rod buckles are the best system, they always keep tension on the rods. you can install them flat in the floor or cut into the gunnel, i have done both and liked the floor mount the best but either way is good."
792124,Sebastian,2013-06-11 23:45:00,208,X2 for the bass pro rod straps. I even added a couple of tiny bungee cords(small blue ones from home depot) in between. Secured around 6 downrigging/copper rods down at 40mph without any problems.

792473,Believer,2013-06-13 21:01:00,40,I have two for when i take my rod with me on the seadoo. Greatest investment ever. Especially after losing a rod last year
