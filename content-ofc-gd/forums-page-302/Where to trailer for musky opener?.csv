700576,Pigeontroller,2012-05-28 22:19:00,2793,"Check the regs, as there's 2 opening dates for Muskie, 1st Sat and 3rd Sat in June...Not sure if the near to GB lakes are the 1st Sat."

700637,Rizzo,2012-05-29 00:46:00,4754,Crane lake/Blackstone are pretty much it around Parry Sound as far as inland lakes. Musky fishing is pretty tough from what I hear. What about heading north a bit? I would fish the Magnetewan river at Britt. Might even be closer for you than going to Crane!
700661,trevy727,2012-05-29 01:40:00,351,"Go to the French river, Hartley bay road. It's only about an hour north."
700662,Pigeontroller,2012-05-29 01:42:00,2793,Magnetewan is not open till the 3rd Sat
700663,trevy727,2012-05-29 01:50:00,351,"Sorry, same for the French, 3rd Saturday."
700666,Raf,2012-05-29 01:52:00,3495,double check your regs boys.
700670,Pigeontroller,2012-05-29 02:22:00,2793,"  No need to be sorry, you had better do some research though..."
792462,me2grant,2013-06-13 20:14:00,2,You catch anything at the french there Bawd??
792477,Freshtrax,2013-06-13 21:17:00,2215," There's no fish in the French come on,..........  ....if you decide to go check for yourself bring an extra prop."
