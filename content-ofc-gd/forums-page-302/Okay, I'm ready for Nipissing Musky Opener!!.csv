792099,Joey,2013-06-11 21:23:00,9122," it was a dyed kind of rice paper.  I got it at DeSerres.  They have other colors too and ones with leaves infused in them.  I'll attach a few below to show  you and you can show your boss.  So the first one is a squid on brown, leaf infused paper:     This one is of some small butterfish on cream leaf infused paper:      Tell him to experiment too.  You can get some really neat fish at the T n T Market.  This one was one of my favorites, but it sold.  I wish I had of kept it, but I can make another:  "

792111,Joey,2013-06-11 22:45:00,9122,"  Okay, well when I get back from Nipissing, I'll make up a bunch of orange/black and post a thread for anyone interested.  Thanks Dave!!"

792175,Joey,2013-06-12 04:11:00,9122,Thanks everyone.  I really enjoy doing them.  Only a few more days.  Just ticking off my checklist and slowly packing stuff!!!
791508,Joey,2013-06-09 22:45:00,9122,"Been a busy girl here!!  We're heading to Lakair for musky opener and I thought I'd make a few new lures to entice the beasts.  I think I'm ready now.  The blades are 10's and 12's.   Also, I've been doing artwork called Gyotaku, which is a fish rubbing of a fish on rice paper using printer block ink.  Instead of selling these two, I decided to get them framed for myself.  I don't think I like them together on the wall like that, but I'll decide later where I'm going to put them.  Just put them up to get a feel for where I want them to go.           "
791518,lew,2013-06-09 23:21:00,12766,"Those lures are outstanding Joey, but where's the black with orange ??  Have a great trip and just leave me one 50""er  Hopefully your still there when we arrive on the 22nd."
791534,Joey,2013-06-09 23:43:00,9122,"Well unfortunately they did not have any black and orange left Lew  Oh well, maybe they'll like a new color this year  Yup, looking forward to seeing you!!!"

He has only used white paper so far and was very impressed with the one you did with the black background. Was that black rice paper or was it dyed?  Jon"
