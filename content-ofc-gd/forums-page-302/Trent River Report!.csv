When fishing our usual crappie spot, we caught many crappie (kept 6)We did get some OOS fish that were all released they were bass and a Huge Walleye in the same spot as the crappies.   After a great day of mixed species I decided to use the old tried tested and true method of large sucker minnows and a bobber..Had a good day with lots of smaller pike. On the last minnow I managed get a big one to hit! I must admit I'm new to Pike fishing so this was my PB pike. Had a great weekend! Lots of fish and a huge crappie feast! Does life get any better?        Thanks for looking folks!"

Looks like it took a while to get home and unpacked from the time you posted?  (PS - I should be around tonight if you want to stop by for the rod holders -then maybe your can straighten out the one you were using in the pictures? )

578537,Billy Bob,2011-05-02 12:04:00,5865, I think the crappies died from drinking the Coors Light...
