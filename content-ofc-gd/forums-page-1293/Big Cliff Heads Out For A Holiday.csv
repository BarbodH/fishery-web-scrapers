18575,Big Cliff,2007-01-03 12:48:00,6899,"Well gang, I know I haven't been around much for the last few months, working on a computer for 8-10 hours a day, by the time I get home at night the last thing I want to do is sit down in front of my computer.  Just wanted to let you know, I haven't forgotten about any of you!  I am leaving tomorrow morning early for North Myrtle Beach and won't be back until the end of Jan.. Hope to come back all rested and ready to go again with my batteries recharged.  Take care of each other, play nice, be safe! I'll check in if I get a chance to, otherwise, see you all at the end of the month.  P.S.  I still haven't gotten any offers of food donations for the Tyler G2G so pleas, if you can help out post here or email me at home."
