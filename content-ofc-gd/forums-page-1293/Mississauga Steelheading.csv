When we got there the water was high but atleast today it was more green than brown.  Here are a couple shots of the river when we arrived.   We quickly got to work drifting our bags down the river looking for an unlucky steelhead.  Here are some shots of my buddy and I.   All in all it was a nice hour and a half.  I hooked into two but quickly lost them due to them spitting the hook and we got blown on about 10 bags or so.  We will be back down there tomorrow to try for some before the Canada gold game so I will have another report for everyoen.  Hope you all had a nice day and man do I wish I was ice fishing!"

18883,charlied,2007-01-04 02:05:00,584,Hey shaun...I might be free to come down and fish sunday...I may be in Oshawa...you interested?
18903,Carp,2007-01-04 03:04:00,1488,"Nice to be able to fish the river with these mild temps.  Hey, at least you got out there, even though there wasn't any fish landed."
18905,Rich,2007-01-04 03:09:00,3927,"For some reason I always pictured the Credit as a much larger river.  Nice pics, too bad you didnt get any! Better luck next time."
18915,FishFinder,2007-01-04 03:31:00,481,"Rich that spot is narrow and pretty deep, the river is bigger in most other places, but still a small river "

19094,The Urban Fisherman,2007-01-04 22:41:00,2050,"Nice pix dude!  I hit the credit on monday, walked all the way from dundas to the 403, got snagged on my sixth drift, went to tie on a new hook and realised they had fallen out of my pocket!!!!!! oh well...  I'm hittin' it again on sunday!  Good fishin' UF"
19104,ccmtcanada,2007-01-04 23:07:00,7971,"I'm new at this trib fishing thing, but I'm slowly getting hooked!!! With the cooler weather, shore fishing can get down right CCCCOLD, but the tribs offer some nice shelter from the wind!  I've invested 3 trips and about 13 hours to local tribs...haven't caught anything yet, but I'll be out there after the rains in the next few days."
