18666,crappieperchhunter,2007-01-03 18:55:00,2582,"Last day of holidays today for me. Went to a local Conservation area to walk around and get some fresh air.  I noticed a ton of Goldenrod along one of the trails. I remembered a thread I read on a board somewhere..maybe this one...about using the larvae inside for tipping baits with. Took out the trusty pocket knive on the keychain and sliced a gall open. The larvae inside was about the same length as the maggots you buy around Lake Simcoe all winter that I tip jigging raps with for perch...but it was at least twice as fat. Almost round it was so chubby. So I figured I'm out nothing and in less then 10 minutes I filled the 2 big pockets of my Tough Duck jacket up with 150 galls.  Brought them home and they are now in a bucket out in the garage.   I use maggots alot, but they are hard to come by sometimes, particularily early ice when tackle shops have not started stocking them yet. Also at last ice when tackle shops stop getting them in.  I hope they work, because if they do I have a free unlimited supply.  Anyone out there given them a try? I'd like to have some input from others who have tried them."
18675,yellowboat,2007-01-03 19:10:00,211,I've seen them use for whitefish up north with good success. Ohh and they are Golden Rods
18677,crappieperchhunter,2007-01-03 19:16:00,2582,"Thank you for correcting me yellowboat. I changed the ""marigold"" reference in my message to Goldenrod but could not edit it in the title."
18678,yellowboat,2007-01-03 19:20:00,211,"No prob, I'm glad that $2000 for the first year of college wasn't a waste. FYI they are wasp larva so don't let the hatch in the spring in your garage"
18679,Spiel,2007-01-03 19:21:00,9065,  ....I have no doubt they would work and are available real cheap for those who like to hike about.  Oh and title changed for you CPH.
18683,crappieperchhunter,2007-01-03 19:28:00,2582,"Thxs again Yellowboat and Spiel, much appreciated. I will take all the help I can get when it comes to stopping me looking like a idiot."
18767,Beans,2007-01-03 22:40:00,3339,Geeze...now I'm cornfused...I googled wasps last fall as there was a nest in the crawlspace under the house that I wanted to remove...It said that all but the queens die off (hibernate) each winter so I waited a long time for cold enough weather to do its thing and sure enough...no wasps to be found...I cant believe they ate through the nylon screen to get under there...will use wire screening for replacement...  If what Yellowboat sez is right...what you have is all queens so don't let them get too warm or you will end up with your own private aviary(sp?)...   Where did the spell-check go ???
18798,Rich,2007-01-04 00:01:00,3927,I know they work great for trout! I imagine panfish would gobble them up even quicker
18946,wuchikubo,2007-01-04 06:38:00,1114,Larvae within a Goldenrod Gall is either from the Goldenrod gall fly or the parasidic wasp.  Here check this link out:  http://www.fcps.edu/StratfordLandingES/Eco...od_gall_fly.htm
18959,crappieperchhunter,2007-01-04 11:23:00,2582,Thx for the link HearingFish. Interesting read.
