18655,Smokey,2007-01-03 17:59:00,1278,Man what a game....I'm with you on the edge of the couch the whole overtime and shoot out.  One more to go.
18659,Fishandchips,2007-01-03 18:32:00,72,"tense was not the word for it, i have no finger nails left, now lets get gold on Fri,give me a day to calm down, Brian"

18664,BITEME,2007-01-03 18:48:00,1969,I dont get it  Why so excited
18783,charlied,2007-01-03 23:24:00,584, Because I love hockey and I love team Canada....nothing wrong with strongly supprting your favourite team!!!!!!
18785,Bernie,2007-01-03 23:30:00,3190,I   watched it on my puter at work..Very cool.
18978,Northhunter,2007-01-04 14:04:00,214,"It didn't look like they were gonna be able to tie it, but the shootout was intense!  I don't get it either - someone posts about the laughs (leafs) and there's pages of replies. A team made up of our best players who aren't yet in the NHL beats the U.S. in a shootout with 4 extra rounds to make it to the gold medal game against the Russians and there's 6 posts... :/"
18984,Squid,2007-01-04 14:32:00,1656,Was a great game to say the least.
19038,JFR,2007-01-04 18:47:00,498,"Yes, it was a great game.    BUT  I HATE THE CONCEPT OF A SHOOT OUT TO DETERMINE A WINNER   They have wussified the game.  Back in the day, real men would play to the bitter end.  Sissified, I say, Sissified   John"
19062,jediangler,2007-01-04 21:28:00,1923,"It was a great game. Canada outshot 12-2 in OT. Price slides back into the net during a save in the shootout, may have been a goal. They'll have to give an effort 3 times what they did against the USA if they expect to beat the Russians. With a really good goalie and superior speed the Russians will be twice as hard to beat as the Yanks. Canada will have to dig deep and use our secret weapon, HEART.  Go Canada Go"
