19167,GNODDY,2007-01-05 02:17:00,163,I have to say I was in there the day after boxing day and the bald guy was working and found him to be a bit rude and snotty especially when Gagnons  down the road had everything on for no tax and Tightlines didnt have any specials at all. I still spent money there and when I walked out I said to my buddy who was with me that it would be hard for me to go back there and spend my money with that guy in there
19174,Smokey,2007-01-05 02:39:00,1278,I'm in there all the time. Nothing but great service and huge selection of gear. They actually expanded the back end of the shop early last year.  They do have a large amount of musky gear and lots of gear for the big lake trollers.  Another plus to the shop is right next store is the Black and Decker outlets with lots of deals on tools.
