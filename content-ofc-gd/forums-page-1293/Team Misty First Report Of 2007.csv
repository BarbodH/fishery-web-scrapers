18766,mistyjr1,2007-01-03 22:40:00,97,"My Dad (Mistyriver1) and I were dying to get fishing and since there is no ice   we decided to go try some Simcoe dock fishing, our first bit of fishing for 2007.  We got there around 11:00 and the fish weren't cooperating but when they started, they didn't stop...  Here are a few pictures from the day...  I started the day off with this nice Simcoe perch    A few more..      Then my dad switched to the same bait that I was using and he had success..    The jiggin raps were working really good for us today...      The day went by VERY fast!!!  But time flies when you are having fun We ended up getting 27 nice perch (all released to swim another day  ) No PB's or huge fish, but it was sure good to wet a line.  Thanks for reading. I hope you enjoyed.  Mistyjr1"
18771,pikeie,2007-01-03 22:44:00,380,"good report buddy! we were down there today to too. the fish were biting better today then yesterday. we also caught 7 perch over 9inches, and 2 over 10 that we kept. and released many more. edit- after looking closer at your pics, we seemed to be on the same dock at one point lol."
