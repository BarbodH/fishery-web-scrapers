18469,fishnsled,2007-01-03 02:02:00,3520,"Finally getting around to getting some pics put together and want to share this awesome gift that my girlfriend made for me.  Over the past year she has spent countless hours and a fair amount of money making me a new quilt for the bed.  What kind of quilt would be more appropriate for a fisherman the a fishing quilt!    Each square has a fishing/outdoor theme in the centre and the edges are made up of various fabarics.  The quilting itself looks like ripples on the water, some have said, and others a fly line being cast.  You can judge for yourself.        The edge around the quilt looks like this.    Now it's time to do get rid of the wallpaper and do some painting.  Thank you very much.  Love ya."
18472,Smokey,2007-01-03 02:05:00,1278,That looks awesome. You better hang on to her for a while. Nice work.
18489,pameladallaire,2007-01-03 02:41:00,470,"How sweet is that!  I grew up making quilts with my grandmother and only stopped a few years ago to put in more time painting.  Believe me, it takes longer to make a quilt than for me to paint a painting. Nice present!!  Pam"

Anybody elses fingers hurt? I didn't think so.""  Sorry.. the quilt reminded me of a random scene from Happy Gilmore.  Nice gift!"
