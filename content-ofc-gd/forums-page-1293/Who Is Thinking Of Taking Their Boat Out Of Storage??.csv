19209,ccmtcanada,2007-01-05 04:41:00,7971,"CTV National News said tonight that 2007 is forecasted to be the warmest year on record.  With the help of a now very strong el nino, Southern Ontario should see much warmer than normal temps this winter.  So, with the weather being unbelievably warm this winter, is anyone thinking of taking their boat out of storage?  Fishindevil and I went to the BOQ back in November....this weekend is going to be warmer than when we went hunting for walleye!  Long range forecast is saying back up to 13C in a few weeks...."

19260,Mike the Pike,2007-01-05 14:04:00,3421,"Yes Cliff I am thinking about it bringing her back out.Problem is I don't have a 4X4 so if the ramps are a little slik its going to be alot of work, salt,traction aids and friends pushing.If i take it out and it gets cold like -20 I will have to change the oil in the foot.This weekend I will be using the hip waiders.   This is what I really want to take out.   This is what I keep thinking about taking the tarp off.   Question is should I ?Is the cold weather going to come? I really am not sure yet.Depends on the next 2 months.  ice   ice  ice"
19263,davew3,2007-01-05 14:11:00,430,Hope to get out this weekend. Make sure your license is valid
19264,lew,2007-01-05 14:17:00,12767,"And make sure your boat insurance is in place, as alot of policies don't cover you on the water thru the winter months and it could cost you some serious $$$$ if there's an incident."
19275,oldphart,2007-01-05 14:46:00,665,"~~~I was on the BOQ last Saturday,  and this weekend I'll be on Simcoe"

19300,bucktail,2007-01-05 15:56:00,1857,We might want to get in the boats over the next weekend and take advantage of it because it looks like it is finally coming to an end. You knew it had to!!!!  http://wwwa.accuweather.com/canada-forecas...ic=1&set=99
19305,lovetofish,2007-01-05 16:04:00,500,Still mad about putting my boat in storage!  Wish i didn't have to at all.... hmmm...... don't know if its worth winterizing it again....  decisions decisions  lovetofish
19348,walleyejigger,2007-01-05 18:08:00,876,"nahhh i'm done till spring  as crappy as the weather and ice is, i'm sure the lakes around here will still be covered for awhile"
19370,irishfield,2007-01-05 19:00:00,26272,"Thank goodness that's a decission I don't have to make...as I""m currently boatless! Otherwise yes...it would be back out and we'd be fishin..."
