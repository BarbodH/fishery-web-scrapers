19058,Tdel,2007-01-04 21:02:00,393,"There is  a small program called ""Tiny Spell"" which I find very handy when I need a spell checker.  This page has all the info about it and the download.  Tiny Spell  There is a payware version and a free version.  I have been using the freeware version of Tiny Spell for a long time now. It just sits in your tray and tells you when you make a spelling mistake by changing color and plays a sound. You can disable the sound if you want.  It doesn't matter what program you are using or if you are online or offline, Tiny Spell follows every word you type and notify's you if you make a mistake.  If certain words are not in its dictionary and you know the spelling is correct then you can add them to Tiny Spells dictionary.  You can use Tiny Spell with the spell checker on this site or any other site and just use it as back up if you want.   Tom"
