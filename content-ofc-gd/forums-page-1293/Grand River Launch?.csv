18991,outdoor,2007-01-04 15:14:00,19,Anyone know where I can launch in the Grand Near Erie this weekend?? I usually launch at Maitland but I'm sure the dock is out.
18993,moosehead,2007-01-04 15:26:00,90,There is a ramp behind the arena in Dunnville with a permanent dock that stays in all year (east side of the dam) or you could check out the launch across the river at the Grand Island BBQ. What are you heading out for walleye?
