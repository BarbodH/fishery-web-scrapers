But what I REALLY want to get back to is small business. By far, it's the most rewarding work someone could ask for. Sure, there's tons of stress at times, and some months you don't know how you're gunna pull through... but it all washes away when you have that one on one conversation over the counter with a customer, who you know will come back for that personal touch that big box stores can't deliver.

The projects I work on always provide new challenges and no two jobs are the same.  I have also done lots of home renovation plans and new home plans (architectural drafting), but I can no longer do that as the Ontario Gov't. has come out with new Building Code regulations that prevent me from being able to do those drawings, even tho' I have approx. 35 yrs. drafting experience.    That is unless I want to spend 2K on Bull courses and then pay approx. 6K/yr for Bull insurance. Apparently the Gov't. does not feel I am qualified, yet a home owner with no experience in this field is allowed to provide their own drawings (doesn't this sound like typical government??)  .
