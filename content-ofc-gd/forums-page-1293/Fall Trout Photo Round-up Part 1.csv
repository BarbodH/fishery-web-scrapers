18779,irishfield,2007-01-03 23:11:00,26272," They're actually 80KB to almost 200KB..makes a huge difference when you're on 22,800 ...compared to if they were all below 70KB. I fully understand it's sometimes hard to compress that low of res anymore with todays mega mega pixal cameras. Not complaining....just begging! LOL"

18857,irishfield,2007-01-04 01:28:00,26272,"THANKS Tony! Ya really didn't need to go to that trouble. Really great you did though...I know some of the ""experienced"" fishermen over Buckhorn way were giving up trying to read the forum on dial up.  You've had a busy season! How many more years of washin Aaron's boat before he lets you drive? lol"

19287,tonyb,2007-01-05 15:22:00,1637," W15h1N, you don't need a guide! I've seen your reports...  Most probably don't notice, but all the hooks on my lures are swapped out for Gamakatsu's, including my spinners which I add a small split ring to be able to change the hooks. I also re-sharpen my hooks often.  I didn't lose a single fish on lures for trout this year as a result.  Do sharp, quality hooks matter? YOU BET!  Tony"
