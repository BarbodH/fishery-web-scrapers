19019,Tomcat,2007-01-04 17:22:00,395,"We have a week long walleye trip planned for next August to a very secluded area where there is no access to electricity. We've been researching various power sources to run spotlights (returning to camp in darkness) or other equipment (like a 12 volt electric filleting knife). Although I don't have any problems filleting walleye with a non electric fillet knife, I'm interested in looking at options. I read elsewhere that a portable jump start/power supply was used successfully for a week as the only power source for a 12 volt filleting knife. Research on portable jump start/power supplies indicates that many contain a 20 amp hour battery. Consequently, why not simply take a 20 amp hour deep cycle battery to power a 12 volt filleting knife rather than a portable jump start/power supply?  To facilitate responses, here's an example of a portable jump start/power supply that weighs less than 25 lbs. It contains a 19 amp hour battery. http://www.tylertool.com/blackanddecker44.html Thanks in advance."
