Anyways, I've had a bunch of waders over the years and thought I could help ya out with some info. I've had both neoprene and breathable waders and I've come to the conclusion that neoprene is really the way to go from now on. They're easier to maintain, the holes are really easy to patch up, and they do keep ya warm in the winter months.  There's a lot of companies out there now as compared to when I got my first pair about 10 years ago. Some really good quality stuff for the price. One of the things with waders is that they really are a long term investment unless you beat the crap out em. Buying cheap can be good but you still have to sift through the crap that is out there. As a general rule anything in the ""under 100"" range probably won't get ya thru a heavy season and even if you don't use em much they'll fall apart eventually so just avoid them. There's a few good pairs in the 100-150 range. Especally if you can get a pair on sale at the show or thru a dealer. Bare ( http://www.northernangler.mb.ca/onlinecata...waderindex.html ) makes a great product.  I remember a couple of years ago seeing a pair at the show for 129$ Their regular prices are up there but for the quality it's without a doubt a fair trade. Hodgeman also has a big line of waders. I Purchaced a pair of their breathable waders but the leaks came fast and it was in the nepoprene part of the foot.   I'm not sure if all their neoprene waders were like that but it was enough for me to not go back to them.  Their prices are good but for the one season I got out of them it's just not enough. Here's a link anyways, http://www.eaglesportscenter.com/products/...an/neoprene.htm I've read some good reviews about a company called Snobee. Not sure where they're based ( UK I think) but  the reviews all seemed like this company is on the up and up. Not sure of their avalability here as well going into the higher ends you have companys like orvis http://www.orvis.com/store/home_page.aspx?bhcp=1 or springbrook http://www.springbrook.ca/ or Simms, http://www.simmsfishing.com/za/SIM?PAGE=PR...&CAT=waders. These guys all have high end stuff but you do get what you pay for and a lot of these companies have great return policies and warrenties.  Anyways, sift thru this stuff and if there's anthing else ya wanna know you're definatly in the right place!   FHR"
