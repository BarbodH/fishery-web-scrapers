19331,mrdylan,2007-01-05 17:12:00,111,I have played in bands off and on for years but these days life has been taking over. Mostly heavier stuff.
19345,daisy_girl58,2007-01-05 18:02:00,116,"WoW You guys rock! I have been into music since I was 3 yrs old.. My daughter currently is doing Rock-a-billy in and around Nashville. Before I left the USA, I was doing sultry jazz and blues songs at karaoke and a few Tanya Tucker songs.... Thru the 80's I was doing alot of songs like Pat Benetar and Blondie....  Have you ever heard of a back-up guitarist named Glen Trujillo? Has played with a few big bands...  Lorissa"
19354,Fang,2007-01-05 18:25:00,1330,Lets put a jam night together. I'm too cheap to go for guitar lesson but I've been strumming G-C-D for about a year.  Did anyone else notice that Gman's plastic carpet covers were hung up on the back wall behind the band.  Wow!! dual purpose keeps fish guts off the carpet and the neighbours from calling the cops about the noise.   Next trip should be a shore fish/camp fire/guitar jam
19357,Guest mistyriver1,2007-01-05 18:42:00,0,"When I was 16 my good buddy was in a band and I used to hang around alot with him and decided I would like to play (guitar).  I bought his used one (seen on left) and later picked myself up an acoustic.  I've played on and off for about 20 years never been in a band but just learned my chords and learned songs by ear and sitting around jammin with other players (who are better than me).  Anyways here's my toys...     ps. Note the wallpaper  . This is my rec-room aka ""MANTOWN"""
19358,lilkynan,2007-01-05 18:43:00,173,"Been in bands for years -  Even jammed with Kim M, Mike Woods, The Kings, Destination Unknown and of course - had Mike MacDonald as a drummer in one of my bands back near Ottawa.

The best show I saw was the Shakin into '87 tour at Maple Leafs Gardens....new years eve concert!"
19382,Rich,2007-01-05 19:45:00,3927,"Oh yeah for the record I play guitar.. I taught myself about 3 years ago.. I'm not great at it but always learning. It's almost as addictive as fishing... almost. I can sing too, well... sorta."

19246,Sherriff,2007-01-05 13:42:00,252,"First I would like to say.  FAT CATS ROCK!  CCMTCANADA, awesome stuff.  Great covers.  Really good tunes there.  Not only are you a walleye slayer, your a great performer too.  I feel sorry for you however.  It must be tough to lug all your fishing gear to the cottage and then have to still make room to bring the amps, guitars, drums etc so you can jam out after fishing.  Great work... Sherriff "
19266,setomonkey,2007-01-05 14:21:00,872,"hey ccmt, just took a look at a couple of videos, you guys are good!  Mike"

MY buddys band illScarlett (you may have heard on edge 102) just signed a nice little deal with Sony and are well on their way to the top.  I go to as many of their shows as I can to photograph them... Heres a shot from last sprign in NYC - an acustic set by the lead singer Alex.  "
19269,Bob,2007-01-05 14:28:00,370,I played and sang in a country band briefly and we did some country rock.  Does this count?  I make my living with my own karaoke business now and still sing a few tunes a night.
19272,BITEME,2007-01-05 14:32:00,1969,NICE!!!!   I hack away at it Tried when i was younger it was Frustrating Now again as a Mature adult any way I bought a Marshall MG100hdfx half stack and a Epiphone les paul custom silverburst and have signed up for lessons I WILL TRY AGAIN
19278,Headhunter,2007-01-05 14:58:00,5703,"Back when I was young... about 25 years ago   I attended Fanshawe College in London and took a 2 year course call Music Industry Arts -Recording Production. The course is geared to folks who what to make a living in the music industry, they have two studios and the students record each other on a project basis. All students were musicians/artitist. I played Bass. Was in a number of bands in the 80's, including ""The Cat's Sass"" and ""Amsterdam"". Toured all around Ontario. As our lead guitarist was also a fish head, we would finish playing at 1:00am, then head to the lake/river and fish all night, sleep all day and do it again. Had a great time when playing North Bay, fishin the docks and catchin pike and stuff. Don't really get a chance to play any more, but still dable and enjoy it! HH"
