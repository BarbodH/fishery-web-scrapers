18150,Terry,2007-01-01 22:20:00,14456,"well, I was all set to take my folding boat out from big bay point for some whitefish and trout and to try out my new fishfinder and underwater camera  well way too much wind for that, so I took it down to the holland river to play            there were about 100 of these birds hiding under the bridge and they were not happy to see me      didn't catch a thing... but I had a great time on the water..in a boat..on Jan 1.....  the x67c worked well but didn't show any fish  the camera, well I really didn't think it would work with how dirty the water is but it worked nicely......and even saw a couple of crappie swimming around but the wind was pushing me around so much I couldn't hold the camera still  well back to work tomorrow"
18154,lew,2007-01-01 22:26:00,12767,Good to see your able to get on the water and try out  your new toys Terry.  It feels more like April than January lately.
18159,Chuck Best,2007-01-01 22:32:00,308,"We did the afternoon shift@the top of Cook's bay....Hit some spots and marked fish ,but to no avail.....skunked....no way to start a season......the park is closed at the 8th so no ramp there,we had to go down to lake simcoe marina.....Everyone pray for cold please......we need ice......thx.....Chuck....."
18164,irishfield,2007-01-01 22:43:00,26272,"Who would have thought Terry.....boat fishing in January on the H river! Good to see you got out in the fresh air, while I was sleeping in to start the year off wrong."
18166,Mike the Pike,2007-01-01 22:51:00,3421,Yup hard to believe the boats are out in great numbers.Terry I guess the 4wheeler is resting.Nice to see another die hard get out.  Hey Wayne I think you better speed up delivery on your new boat the ice may arrive in May.  Mike
18170,Smokey,2007-01-01 22:58:00,1278,Terry good see you got out a bit. I got the X67 last year and think its a great machine. Good Luck tomorrow.
18178,urbanangler1990,2007-01-01 23:25:00,933,good to see ya get out! what fish r in the holland? and whats it best known for?
18180,Terry,2007-01-01 23:36:00,14456,"in the spring just as the ice goes out..the crappie move in, some years in big numbers , other years few  pike, perch sunfish bullheads but in the summer bass, big bass flipping the banks of the river  has been known to win bass tourneys did I say snapping turtles..oh yeah big ones........"
18181,fishindevil,2007-01-01 23:39:00,6254,"well like you said terry who would have thought that on jan1 you would be out in a boat,i saw a guy in lake scugog try and get his in to fish only about 1/4 mile of open water ,there is lots of open water now especially after all that rain last night,but to my suprise not all the ice went there is still alot but only about 1-2 inches take care"
18182,urbanangler1990,2007-01-01 23:43:00,933,"thnx Terry! now for bass, is it best at mouth or anywhere really? R pike in there all year?"
18185,Terry,2007-01-01 23:51:00,14456,no pike is spring and fall but never any numbers..bass is everywhere the whole river has undercut banks with bullrushes and bass can be there...the less weeds around them the better
18186,urbanangler1990,2007-01-01 23:52:00,933,"thank u, looks like i may have to try it sometime in the summer then... im looking for more good areas close to toronto, this would be good."
18901,tinbanger,2007-01-04 03:02:00,1028,if I hadn't paid too much to shrink wrap the boat in Dec I would be out there to.  Need to find some heated storage for next year  tinbanger
18904,Rizzo,2007-01-04 03:08:00,4754,"what's the world coming to, saw people boating around on Kempenfelt bay today as well!"
18986,Terry,2007-01-04 14:50:00,14456,"if we get a day with no wind I will be taking my 12ft folding boat out there for some whitefish/laketrout..but this time of year, it needs to be real calm"
19007,fishnsled,2007-01-04 16:19:00,3520,Nice to see you got out even if the fish were not cooperating.     Be safe on the big water if you mange to get out.  Do you find the folding boat stable or is it a bit on the tippy side?
19014,Guest mistyriver1,2007-01-04 16:44:00,0,"Nice report Terry, glad the new toy worked well  A year ago, I was icefishing on Cooks Bay with probably about 10 -11 inches of ice and this year we were softwater fishing at the docks.  WOW."
19016,snag,2007-01-04 17:02:00,1932,"Those boats are awesome. I have been very close to purchasing one.  Never heard a bad thing about them. For what they are, they seem to be the best."
19035,setomonkey,2007-01-04 18:40:00,872,"Amazing, I'm reading boat fishing reports on Jan 4... I know there's the occasional one from the Niagara but the Holland River??  Mike"
19052,Terry,2007-01-04 20:30:00,14456,"strangely  enough these boats are very stable, I can stand and pick up a big muskie over the side of the boat without worries of tipping...if only I could catch a big muskie... and I was on the rideau and 3ft waves came up..I was safe and comfortable on the trip home..but this time of year I am more careful"
19112,Sinker,2007-01-04 23:32:00,8692,How much HP can that little boat handle?  Pretty slick little boat for sure!  Sinker
19138,Terry,2007-01-05 00:48:00,14456,it will take about a 4 hp the new square back ones handle bigger hp better then mine
