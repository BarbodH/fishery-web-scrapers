19474,Garyv,2007-01-05 23:52:00,547,This just amazes me for the end of the first week of January.  I had a friend that took his boat out by the water treatment plant in Pt Edward today.  Surface temp all over the area and in the St Clair river was 42F on average.  He said he did not mark much of anything and never got a hit.  Without the ice it could be a bad season this spring for Salmon and Rainbow around here.
