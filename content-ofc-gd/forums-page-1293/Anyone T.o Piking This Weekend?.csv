18710,snag,2007-01-03 20:46:00,1932," Thanks for the invite brother but I am never certain what days I can escape the salt mines.  I think you'll be very successful though I'm sending good vibes your way.  I think Friday is the day. Overcast, low winds and 10 degrees!  If I fish on Friday and catch anything, I will go topless.  I challenge you to a topless report.  Good luck!!!!!!  p.s. practice like nuts on the new baitcaster, if you haven't already"

18717,Steelcat,2007-01-03 21:07:00,191,I'm thinking to head down to Toronto downtown for some fishing with my dad and/or my bro. Still thinking i we should just head to Ward's Island or just hangout right at the waterfront and fish beside those docks Now all depends on if they are free or not
