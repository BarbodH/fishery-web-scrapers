I think if that happens I'll reach my other goals of catching new spieces, or new personal bests.  I also hope to take my freinds boys fishing a few times and really get 'em ""hooked""  Maureen"
17855,mepps,2007-01-01 00:11:00,1301,50 inch pike and musky are my toughest goals!

18029,Canuck2fan,2007-01-01 13:32:00,1444,For 2007 I just hope to continue to have the physical and financial health to fish as much as I like with the all of the same people I fished with this year. On top of that I would also like to meet twice as many new fishing buds this year as I did in 06. I have one other goal that is the same as last year I hope to watch my father get his first rainbow in long long time because we didn't get it done last year. Now if I could just convince him that at 71 he doesn't need to work 7 days a week it could actually happen too LOL.
18041,Moosebunk,2007-01-01 13:52:00,3970,PB pike.  Keep on getting out.

Hell since I'm dreaming...... If this someone just happens to have a 21' with a 250 verado it wouldn't be all that bad"
18376,TennesseeGuy,2007-01-02 22:38:00,957,I'll be spending time visiting some really nice people in NW Ontario.  We'll spend a lot of time on the water and the catching will take care of itself.  In May I'll share my boat with two special friends on the board that I'll  be meeting for the first time.
18397,Carp,2007-01-02 23:23:00,1488,"I'd like to spend more time on the water this year and go on at least one camping trip with my kids. I've been promising them we'll go, but something always comes up to throw a wrench in the plans. Did the tent in the yard thing, but they want to go fishing, wake up and see the boat waiting for you at the waters' edge kind of camping. I can't argue with that.  "
18409,GbayGiant,2007-01-02 23:40:00,1780,"I'm aiming for the Lockness monster   , if not I'm going for any muskies over 50"" on the bay."

17751,Eddyk,2006-12-31 20:28:00,195,Buying a house in the heart of the Rideau lakes and exploring the fishing. Cant seem to get much information but it sounds like lots of bass and lakers.

17766,tjsa,2006-12-31 21:19:00,1578,"My goal is the same as every year. To catch at least one fish that I am targetting on the day I am fishing, big or small, kept or released, does not matter. Targetting a fish I have never landed before is fine, but if I do not get one, oh well. There is always next time."
17769,Smokey,2006-12-31 21:26:00,1278,My only goal is to get out fishing more. I always have huge dreams about fishing here and there but time never allows it. So next year will hopefully be the year of fishing for me.  Also to conquer downrigger fishing and learn as much as I can about it.
17770,Greencoachdog,2006-12-31 21:27:00,8163,To catch a fish so big... it'll make anybody that see's a pic of it poop their pants!!!

17793,fishdawg,2006-12-31 22:30:00,912,a BIG brown!  looks like I am gonna be doing a lot more open-water trolling for salmon trout & eyes & less time for bass/pike/muskie
17795,lookinforwalleye,2006-12-31 22:32:00,4399,Fish every weekend from the Walleye opener till closing and everyday i am on holidays. Try and fish Simcoe more and hook into a 7 Lbs. Smallie. Try and get out to the BOQ in the fall. Try Trout or Salmon fishing at least once.
17796,lew,2006-12-31 22:33:00,12767,"I guess I'm one of the lucky ones who actually does get to fish as much as I want, and I spend an incredible amount of days on the water over the course of a musky season.  I don't usually set goals, then I'm never disappointed if I don't reach them, but rather just hit the water every day and try to have a good time, and if the fish gods smile on me, well then, it was a good day.    Two years ago I set a goal to help my daughter get her 1st musky, which she did, but setting that goal was an exception for me.  I've been very fortunate in the fact that I've shared my boat with more than 50 different OFNers over the last few years on musky trips and have made alot of good friends around here, and every year I hope to add a few more to the list.  Jamie, I guess the only real goal I've set for next year is to spend a couple days chasing those Ottawa River muskies with you like we've talked about so many times. I'll bring the Suicks and you supply the Dawgs and we'll see about getting that new boat of yours all slimed up"
17812,jordan,2006-12-31 23:11:00,136,My goal for 2007 is to get out and fish more. And catch more fish haha.    jordan

17847,xrap,2007-01-01 00:00:00,683,To get a steelie over 10lbs
17848,nautifish,2007-01-01 00:02:00,1416,Well my goal for 2007 would be to buy a nice log home nothing to big n fancy sat on a small island up north in the middle of  *(&*( no where    No neighbors at all.....Just me and nature  ohhh and a timmys coffe drop twice a week.....Gotta have me timmies...  ....lol..........Some where where i could just walk out my door  and drop a line in the water with out having to hitch up a boat or walk miles.....  But fat chance of that so i guess i will just have to setlle with a muskie.  Never caught one yet because i have never really fished for them. So 2007 i am hoping to catch a real nice one......
