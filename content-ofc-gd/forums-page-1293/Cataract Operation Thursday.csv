18908,pikehunter,2007-01-04 03:19:00,1659,"With my eyesight getting worse and worse I fianally booked my surgery. Tomorrow at 3. I'm just crossing my fingers the surgeon's fear of double vision after the operation doesn't happen. With such poor eyes he warned me of this possibility, that is why I have put the surgery off for a year now.  Night driving has become more troublesome and I can't read addresses on customers homes anymore, not it was very easy to read many of them before. It has just become almost imposible lately. And reading almost anything is a real chore anymore. After tomorrow maybe all will be easier.  I was warned about 2 years ago that I would develope a cataract on my left eye after I had emergency retina surgery for 3 tears and a hemorage, so the time has come.  See ya all later."
18909,ccmtcanada,2007-01-04 03:21:00,7971,Good luck!  They do these operations all the time...I'm sure you'll come out of it just fine...and you'll be spotting fish in the water in no time!!!

18932,OhioFisherman,2007-01-04 04:45:00,6623,Good Luck PikeHunter!

18947,Bob,2007-01-04 09:00:00,370,"I wore fairly thick glasses for most of my life and several years ago, I started going blind with fast developing cataracts. When the doc asked me if I wanted to think about the surgery for a while, I said ""Get 'er done!""  I figured I was going blind anyway so a few months sooner if he messed up made not much difference to me.  I haven't worn glasses since, I guess he hit my prescription pretty close with the implants.  I realise not everyone is as lucky as me but there is hope always.  Technology is a wondrous thing.  I've had laser retinal surgery since as well and milady is currently undergoing a series of retinal laser treatments too.  Those guys are getting good at that stuff.  Look on the bright side."
18950,lew,2007-01-04 09:30:00,12767,Best of luck to you PH. I've known quite a few folks who've had the same operation and every one came out with great results.
18952,Chuck Best,2007-01-04 10:50:00,308,"As others have said ,'They've doing it for years',I remember my Grandma having it done and she's been gone for 25 years.....and I can't remember anyone having any problems after .......Good Luck PH......"
18953,motv8tr,2007-01-04 10:53:00,2587,"Good luck PH, I'm sure everything will go fine and you'll see better than ever soon.  Maureen"
18963,steve_paul,2007-01-04 11:36:00,658,"Good luck PikeHunter, best wishes that all goes well and a quick recovery."
18965,Roy,2007-01-04 11:59:00,13728,I'm sure you'll be better than fine after the surgery. Just a thought though....you fish a lot...have you considered having polarizing lenses put in?  Be well.
18968,Fish Farmer,2007-01-04 12:55:00,2234,"All the best Harry. My wife had both her eyes done a few years ago and she can ""see"" me ""thinking"" about going fishin. You'll be fine Harry, Wait tell you see how big the fish are now that you catch in the river. Take care bud. You'll do fine."
18979,pikehunter,2007-01-04 14:08:00,1659,"Thank you everyone for your suport and confidence. I'm just waiting the clock out now. Technology has made this, as well as other procedures a simple matter. And hopefully I will at least maybe able to see the dock after it's all done!  Everyone I know has also had success, except for my father, but his situation is different then most people.  Polarized lense! Wish I had thought of that!"
18987,jediangler,2007-01-04 14:54:00,1923,My Dad had his torn retinas done in London at St. Jo's last year. They told him that cataracts are inevitable as well. They are a great bunch of talented people down there. Good luck man.
