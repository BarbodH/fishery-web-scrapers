18690,Eddyk,2007-01-03 19:46:00,195,Thanks for the pictures. Took the kids there when they were small and I think I enjoyed it more than them.

18701,Whopper,2007-01-03 20:08:00,2174," I did the same thing, only I'm just thankful that I'll never have to go back. Spent two days there and I don't think I have ever been more miserable.  While we were there they set all time attendance records with record high temps not to mention I think it cost me more than my first house  Glad you had a good time though  Whopper  Sorry for being negative but the pics caused a flash back"

18752,Crazyhook,2007-01-03 22:19:00,1154,welcome home Goran!! I was wondering how you made out
18765,Rich Clemens,2007-01-03 22:38:00,3131,"Used to spend the Christmas holiday in the Orlando area for many a year.  I was a lot younger then, so I didn't get out fishing much.  My grandfather had a house along East Tohopakaliga (sp) in St. Cloud (just south of Orlando).  I spent quite a few evening s taking the bike and hitting the shore lines and docs.  Don't remember catching much though.  I miss those days.  Spent a couple New Year's Eves at Disney World, but it was not the specticle then as it is now.  Sounds like you had a great time."
