18687,ccmtcanada,2007-01-03 19:38:00,7971,"Plane ticket from New Jersey to Toronto: $400  Hiring the Walleye King and Queen for 2 weeks of guiding: $10,000  Finally catching his first Canadian fish:  $14,000  Blyght and I took him back out for another prime night of fishing.  He finally hooked into his first fish.  This monster (and now Canadian personal best) was 9 inches long, 5 inch girth and weighed in at a massive 5 ounces!!!  After doing his happy dance, he finally posed for these two pictures.  The smile says it all.  After a  huge fight that lasted about 4 seconds, the trophy fish came out of the water!!!    Here's another pic....see how big the thing really was??  Now you know why we had to use the lip gripper on the guy!    After spending about $1000 on lures and gear for Canadian fishing, it was all worth it in the end.  He now has an awesome story to tell friends and family for years to come.  The fish was released to get fatter and bigger for another fisherman to get a new Canadian personal best catch!!  What a guy...a true sportsman!!!"

18790,ccmtcanada,2007-01-03 23:41:00,7971," You didn't read the fine print did you???  ""No refunds on deposits...even if we never take you out fishing"".  "
18799,Rich,2007-01-04 00:03:00,3927,Geeze the vertical hold and a lip gripper too! I hope that whopper bullhead survived!  (That is just a joke by the way)

18859,ecxstriper,2007-01-04 01:35:00,343," Thanks for all the help and the loan of the bait machine , and to everyone else, I had a great time reading this board.  I had a great time fiishing with Blyght & Ccmt . I hope to return in the spring for another visit and maybe some fishing. "
18899,Rizzo,2007-01-04 02:59:00,4754,"I won't debate you for using the lip-gripper on that specimen, I wouldn't touch one of those either.  Much like women, fish with whiskers creep me out."
