As you all you, we don't have much chance fishing Sturgeon in Ontario, so I'd say this trip is some what special.  We arrived at the Marina at around 7am in Pittsburg (40mins from downtown San Francisco)   Our captain is Captain Kevin Yost who pilot Lucky Strike.   The weather of the day was sunny with cloudy periods.  Wind was strong at 20 to 30 mph, water temperature was 45F (the temperature shown on the fishing radar was 10F off).   From the fish radar, the Sturgeons were at depths from 50 to 60 feet.   The bait we used were Salmon RoE and Eel  and here is a photo of our gear setting (65lbs test line)  After 5 hours of waiting, we managed to land a 47 inches 30lbs Sturgeon.  The fight was very short due to the cold front and the cold water.   This was the only fish that we've caught, and it's also the only fish caught that day within the delta area.  Overall, it was a fun and memoriable experience since I've never fished Sturgeon before.  Click here for the video that we took when we landed that sturgeon. "
