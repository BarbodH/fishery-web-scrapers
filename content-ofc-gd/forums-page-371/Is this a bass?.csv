727170,BradMc76,2012-09-04 12:18:00,56,"Well, it was caught in Hamilton Harbour in Ontario. So...."
727175,Rich,2012-09-04 12:24:00,3927,I cant believe anyone who fishes could confuse that with a smallmouth.  Obviously a largemouth bass. I have a feeling next year your pictures will feature some much larger fish.  great work!
727177,Harrison,2012-09-04 12:27:00,2202,Looks like a horny chub got a hold of a largie
727188,Rich,2012-09-04 12:47:00,3927,"Spotted bass don't exist in canada, so i really doubt that.  Interestingly though, hamilton harbour is one of the few places in canada with ""wipers"" (white bass/striped bass hybrid) which can grow to 10lbs, and what a fight."
727193,BillM,2012-09-04 12:54:00,17367,"I think Sinclair and I agree, this is 100% an Atlantic.  Case closed, move on people!"
727202,Rich,2012-09-04 13:18:00,3927,"Spotted bass live in freshwater reservoirs in the united states. The ships are coming from foreign seas and through the oceans and dumping ballast water in the canals. Spotted bass would have to be brought up in a bucket or tank and dropped in. It would not survive in lake ontario's cold temperatures, period, without weeks of conditioning, which it would also not survive."
727209,BradMc76,2012-09-04 13:38:00,56,"Well, like I said, I caught it in Hamilton Harbour. The pollution there is enough to mutate anything. So, I'm going to go with a Largemouth Bass with an unusually small mouth. Thank you all for your input."
727213,Rich,2012-09-04 13:43:00,3927,"There is the more likely occurance of a ""mean mouth"" which is a largemouth who spawns with a smallmouth, and happens commonly where the two co-habitate. Good job on the bass, sorry to derail the thread."
726797,BradMc76,2012-09-03 01:21:00,56,  Is it real?
726798,funfishing,2012-09-03 01:24:00,147,That's a small mouthed largemouth.
726799,ttahhan,2012-09-03 01:30:00,191,Brad that's a Small mouth Bass
726802,Christopheraaron,2012-09-03 01:43:00,3525,"Colours say largemouth mouth says smallmouth, but definitely bass."
726803,Rizzo,2012-09-03 01:46:00,4754,yes and no. That is a small large mouth bass
726804,Dontcryformejanhrdina,2012-09-03 01:51:00,535,"The good thing about bass fishing is you can catch big ones even if you don't have a boat, even on those hot sunny days when nothing else seems to be biting. That's a largemouth bass all right. Keep at it and you'll catch ones a lot bigger than that."
726806,kickingfrog,2012-09-03 01:54:00,8333,Your thumb is huge.
726829,BradMc76,2012-09-03 05:03:00,56,"Okay, so it's small (my thumbaside) but that is the biggest Largemouth Bass I have ever caught!!!"
726835,musky_hunter,2012-09-03 07:50:00,328,Lol. Bucket mouth for sure.
726839,eman,2012-09-03 12:26:00,101,Largie!
726840,largemouthtrout,2012-09-03 12:33:00,53,"What the heck , Is that fish wearin lipstick ?"
726845,funfishing,2012-09-03 13:37:00,147,"I feel your excitement, they are a beautiful fish. My first LM was about 13"" and I was excited as hell to have caught it.  Looks like it has a crayfish in its belly."
726882,northernpike56,2012-09-03 15:45:00,717,LMB for sure. nice job.
726900,BradMc76,2012-09-03 17:34:00,56,"So, now I've caught a small Largemouth and a large Smallmouth. I'm not complaining, but that's about standard for how I roll. Irony and comedy all rolled into one."
726905,Cudz,2012-09-03 18:00:00,2652,Body is totally largemouth and marking asre largemouth but I agree that the stipes from the eyes down look smallie. Interesting. Nice job.
726920,Christopheraaron,2012-09-03 19:04:00,3525,"Im most confused about that mouth, I've caught 2 inch largemouth with bigger mouths!"
726948,lunkerbasshunter,2012-09-03 20:30:00,2585,largie
726988,Christopheraaron,2012-09-03 21:50:00,3525, Yup. Now where is garfisher to answer this?
727083,Garfisher,2012-09-04 01:16:00,229,"It's still a largemouth (larger markings concentrated along the middle of the side of the fish), I'm guessing it's just an odd ball that has a smaller mouth, probably just genetic variability. I'm sure we've all caught a smallie or two that has a pretty big maw on it for one of that species. I remember my friend from southern Maryland showing me a pic of a red-eyed largemouth someone managed to catch, no smallmouths around the area (too far onto the coastal plains for smallie habitat)."
727090,Musky or Specks,2012-09-04 01:35:00,2710,It kinda looks like a mean mouth but didn't think we had any hybrids up here. Who knows what the states are stocking though maybe got up here from there
727091,BradMc76,2012-09-04 01:36:00,56,"That's what I was thinking, based on the colourings. But, as I've said, I'm not really sure what I'm talking about, lol.  Thanks for the info, though, Gar!"
727093,Musky or Specks,2012-09-04 01:40:00,2710,Best photo example I could find of a mean mouth thats similar to example of OP  
727100,Musky or Specks,2012-09-04 01:48:00,2710,I agree the mouth is just not right for a largemouth
727118,Garfisher,2012-09-04 02:39:00,229,"Best question is where it was caught (obviously not the actual location, but maybe a county name), spotted's do not occur in Ontario, the only Micropterus species that occur are in fact salmoides (Largies) and dolomieu (Smallies). Hybrid isn't out of the question either. I just think it really is a largemouth (most of the fish screams largemouth, only the mouth/head throws a wrench into that thought)"
727127,BillM,2012-09-04 03:08:00,17367,"Regardless of the mouth, that's a largie no doubt about it."
