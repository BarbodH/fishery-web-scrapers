Because I live in southern Ontario I'll be driving up to and spending time on Kennebec Lake this weekend  and I might or might not test out my silly and absurd practice but that all depends on my mental state.

If you must call the MNR they can reach me at 905-NICE-TRY. Way too funny folks.   Austerity is already here. I sure hope there is this much fight in you when there is no one to watch stocks.

We follow the laws, because its the right thing to do, and because I respect the fishery, as well as all the others that enjoy it.  I spend countless hours teaching the same philosophies to my children as well, for future generations, mine and yours.  To me thats a pretty generalized and offensive comment, and trying to justify your actions towards poaching, all the while lumpsumping humans, is pretty ignorant and downright rude.  I can see where your coming from, but the law is the law, and you are preaching your case to some VERY serious advocates of our ecosystem/fisheries on this site.  Thats just the way I feel...

Lumping all natives into that group is incredibly ignorant, and blaming the ones who were fishing here long before us for the collapse of anything seems very stupid. But then again, so does banking limits from years past.  By the way, with your banking fish ruling, i guess that means next time i visit your kennebic lake, im allowed to take 10,000 walleye and pike?

I can legally catch limit day after day, gift hundreds of them all away and if I stop for lunch and eat one or two I cannot catch  more to fill my bag limit? Are we all living on the same planet? WOW!!! They must be mailing the Kool-Aid now.   Up until a couple of years ago it was a rarity when I kept my catch, let alone limits but as I get older I am enjoying the catch as well as the whole experience more completely than ever before and for that I must follow every single, solitary rule to the absolute letter? Those of you that want to follow each other down the kill chute, can, as well as pile onto guys like me when I pinch ya a lil. Either way, I'm going to enjoy my shore lunch... and y'all can enjoy all day KinderCare , another farce that your sport was sacrificed for.  IMO.

All of us also know that these types would never count a fish caught yesterday against today's limit.  Let's be realistic here.  I've never once heard someone say something like, ""I wish I could keep this otherwise legal fish...but I checked before I left the house and I've got a limit in the freezer already.""  I have heard a few individuals proudly brag about having a ""freezer full"" though.  The likelihood of having your home searched and being charged for breaking the regs over a zippy or two of fillets is practically zero...this fact is not lost on those who ignore the law."

And yes, they are grossly overpaid and compensated when compared to the same private sector positions. They are not perfect but shouldn't they strive to attain it instead of making excuses or writing more rules?  As far as possession limits. I have never(not yet anyway) kept more than my legal limits, but you probably conveniently skipped past that as well just like they have to letter after letter that I've  sent with them with my concerns only to be answered with the usual computer generated hokey pokey bull ""We have received your letter and have acknowledged your concerns blah blah blah.... which really makes me feel like an important part of this deal.   I have decided, like an ever growing number of citizens that I will pick and choose my spots until the puppet masters stop playing fast and loose with my dough and my family's future. Answer me this. Is it right that natives can do what they please at the fisheries expense ? Last time I checked my birth certificate I was still a native of this country as well. Thats just one of my issues but as my posts demonstrate its not the only one.   My proposal would be this: I've been fishing for years and have caught and released many limits and although it would be illegal I will choose to release the odd fish from my banked limits.

If you practice catch and release how many fish do you take the chance in injuring and/or exposing to other predators? Give me a break and stop lying to yourselves.

726315,Rich,2012-08-31 09:57:00,3927,"First off with your mentality, you obviously live in the north where fishing pressure is far less an issue.  And second, i usually do smash 50-60 fish in a day. No need to cull or change species, because it's perfectly legal and safe to keep catching and releasing them. A CHANCE that 10% of what i catch will die with normal c&r practice. So thats 5-6 fish. A limit. And likely only very small fish will be the rare victim of mortality, rather than the breeding fish stuffed to the door of your freezer."
726316,Fishnwire,2012-08-31 10:00:00,983," There's no legal limit to the amount of fish one can catch and release, whereas there is a legal limit to how many of certain species of fish you can keep.  I might ""take a chance [of] injuring"" the fish I catch and release...but I'm fairly certain they have a significantly better chance of survival than the ones (legal or otherwise) that you take home.  I always laugh when a meat fisherman tries to suggest that catch and release is as harmful to the fishery as limiting out.  Your assertion that C&R is not beneficial over ignoring limits though is downright hilarious.  At least it would be if it wasn't kind of sad.  Have fun and good luck walleye fishing this weekend.  Hopefully not too many people with the attitude that they are ""owed"" fish over their limit due to previous less-than-limit outings have fished there before you...otherwise you may very well get skunked."

An angler catches a limit of fish and eats 2 for lunch. Am I to understand that said angler is not allowed to catch 2 more to fill his/her limit?  The fish have been consumed therefore allowing an angler to fill the limit again. Basic math, no?  Illogical to say the least, but nothing new."
725167,Dabluz,2012-08-26 04:53:00,701,"  No....if you catch and keep your daily limit, you cannot catch anymore fish even though you eat 1 or 2 at midday.  However, it would be hard for a conservation officer to be able to prove that you ate some fish during the day."
725169,Woodsman,2012-08-26 10:31:00,1286,You got me there as I also can't figure out the rational. Someone who actually contributes to the system is allowed less of a limit than someone who has not contributed. A conservation possession limit on non license holders makes sense. My guess is that by buying the cheaper license you are agreeing to a smaller catch & possession limit to save a few dollars. If you want to retain the larger possession limit by the sports fishing license.
725170,pikehunter,2012-08-26 10:41:00,1659," I used that argument one time when discussing this with a buddy. His answer was right, but they could have been observing you, see you having a shore lunch and get you that way. Hey who knows?  My feeling is that yes this is possible. But even more likely this would be the situation. They charge you, the case goes to court, it may get tossed out, it may not get tossed out, who knows? What I do know is that your reputation has been compromised, it has been published and the way media presents all cases the public automatically assumes guilt. Then to hurt you even more you just spent a ton of money on legal fees and made your lawyer happier as he spends your money on his next vacation.  Why bother trying to press your luck? It's just not worth it. Follow the rules and if you feel that bad luck is looking for you then keep the grocery store receipts for the sportfish you bought until you eat it. Not all that difficult to understand."

725196,SirCranksalot,2012-08-26 14:00:00,3291," I an relate to that. I thought I made a mistake 1 time last year, but I was wrong!   "
725200,Rich,2012-08-26 14:07:00,3927," Indeed! If i plan to catch and keep fish, i plan to eat them that day. Sooooo much better fresh!"
725225,hooked!,2012-08-26 16:07:00,38,"  16. Subject to sections 19 to 21, no person who is fishing under a sport fishing licence or a conservation fishing licence shall catch and retain in any one day, or possess, fish of a species set out in column 2 of Part 1 of Schedule 3 from the waters set out in column 1,    Provincial Possession Limits 17. Subject to section 18, no person shall possess more fish of a species set out in column 1 of Part 2 of Schedule 3 from the waters of all zones combined than the possession limit set out in column 2. Catch and retain limit refers to the fish that you catch and don't immediately return to the water.  If you catch and retain a fish - including eating it for a shore lunch, or giving to another person, that counts towards your catch and retain limit.  If you are between the ages of 18 and 65, you require a fishing licence to catch and retain fish.  The catch and retain limits are related to the fishery management zone (FMZ) you are fishing in.  So if the limit for walleye in FMZ 10 is 4 and an angler catches and retains four fish, and eats two for shore lunch, he cannot catch and retain two more, because he has filled his limit.  The same angler could go out the next day and catch and retain 2 fish from that FMZ, to reach his possession limit of 4 from that FMZ.  The catch and retain limit is daily, the possession limit applies to all fish from that FMZ regardless of when they were caught.  So in the shore lunch example if the angler went out and caught 2 more fish, he would have caught and retained 6 fish that day, not to mention he would be in ""possession"" of six fish (including the two in his belly - but good luck proving that!)  The provincial possession limits refer to the number of fish any person can have.  It applies to all fish regardless of where they are caught.  For example, the provincial possession limit of walleye is 6.  An angler could catch and retain a limit of 4 fish from FMZ, and catch and retain 2 fish from another FMZ, or accept 2 fish from a friend and still be in compliance with the law.  The fishing regs are somewhat complicated, but you need to understand them!  "
725227,adolson,2012-08-26 16:19:00,783,"It has been done. I saw it posted here, even. MNR busted a few guys, and then pulled carcasses from the lake and charged them for each fish they went over. Like I said before, maybe you should have to take a course before getting a fishing license, since people don't seem to understand the regs.  If you eat fish once a week, OK. I eat fish at least 5 days a week, but usually 7. I don't tend to catch enough trout to fill my limit in a day, let alone fill my plate each day. So I buy."

725464,whiskywizard,2012-08-27 17:05:00,305,"  To paraphrase, you think MNR staff are stupid and overpaid, and have personally tried to produce regulations that confound and confuse you. You don't like this. As a direct result, you will ignore the catch and possession limits and keep more than your daily limit.  And you'll continue to do this until they are paid less or do something more for you.  Did I get that right?  I wonder how many of those ""public sector lightweights"" you spoke of are members here, because they love to fish too.  I'm pretty happy to be here in Ontario, enjoying what we have. I feel the MNR plays a critical role in protecting that. Are they perfect? Nope. Who is? Do I push for continual improvement? Yup. That's how things get better."

Everyone have fun on the water today if you should be so lucky. Ill be bass/pike hunting in less than a half hour!"
724974,jedimaster,2012-08-25 13:19:00,3472,And if your limit is 5 and you eat two for lunch you can't take 5 more home.
724986,Snidley,2012-08-25 14:08:00,620,"This is my favorite law. It applies to my personal nemesis which is bait anglers that employ salmon/rainbow/brown trout roe. Federal law includes roe as caught fish and by extension the roe in your freezer is no different than fillets. Unfortunately the MNR stubbornly refuses to enforce Federal law and, even though their own studies indicate that over harvest for roe collection is endemic in Ontario, they steadfastly refuse to enforce the law or even make mention of it in their publications leaving our pelagics at the mercy of hackers that load the boat and freezer for bait. It's no wonder that pelagic fishing suffers annual decline when turf wars trump good fisheries management and anglers can't accommodate in their minds that you can't slaughter the females of a species before they spawn and still expect that species to thrive. Time to join the rest of Canada and outlaw roe as a legal bait."
725012,Gregoire,2012-08-25 16:18:00,1397,Just being the devils advocate and stiring the pot but what would stop someone from claiming that the fish in their freezer was bought and not angled? In my neighborhood even the Loblaws sells walleye fillets.
725020,SBCregal,2012-08-25 16:56:00,688,im pretty sure if you claim that you need receipts to back it up.
725022,jedimaster,2012-08-25 17:12:00,3472,"They generally don't sell fish in ziplock bags, and if it came down to it they could do biological testing to see what water it came from. ALSO keep in mind. The MnR is highly unlikely to pay you avisit beause of 1 or 2 fillets. I mean we are talking baout horders and poachers that have dozens and hundreds of fish. Yah the caught you red handed 1 or 2 fish over, your gonna get a fine, but investigating where you live,  searching your freezer? They are looking for more than one or two, and if you had say a dozen walleye fillets you would likely have a store reciept or they would be wrapped like from a store."
725048,mercman,2012-08-25 19:06:00,7054,"Its surpriseing how few anglers read and understand the regs  I was fishing with a buddy yesterday, and 2 guys in a boat approached and asked if we wanted a walleye they had caught, because they only got 1 and were leaveing. I asked him if it was within the slot size.He looked at me bewildered and asked what that was He passed it to me, and watched as i showed him the MNR sticker on my boat with the length clearly marked, and showed him where the slot started and stopped.His fish was illegal and very dead   "
725063,Woodsman,2012-08-25 20:17:00,1286,That's true. They would have to have compelling evidence to obtain a search warrant for your home. One or two extra fillets  would not be enough.
725064,Dabluz,2012-08-25 20:20:00,701,"In my region of Quebec, the slot limit is 32 to 47 cm. (13 to 18 1/2 inches).  I doubt very much that someone who catches a 27 or 28 inch walleye would want to put it back into the water.  I'm certain that no one in Quebec would release a record size walleye.  Before the slot limit was instigated, there was no size limit on walleye.  I caught and kept some large walleyes but I did not really enjoy eating those walleye.  The smaller walleye in the 16 to 24 inch range tasted much better so over time, I released all walleye over 6 lbs because I almost always caught as many walleye as I needed to fill my quota anyway.  Ok, I don't give away as many walleye fillets as I used to but the way I figure it, if someone really wants to eat a few walleye fillets, they just might as well do as I do.....go fishing."
725066,Pikeslayer,2012-08-25 20:21:00,1443," You might be surprised at how many anglers actually cannot ""read and understand"" regulations."
725096,adolson,2012-08-25 23:19:00,783,"Almost every week I buy fish. I don't just toss the filets in the freezer how they come packaged, either. I wash them and pack them in ziplocks in some water. The exact same way I do with fish I catch and keep. And I don't keep my receipts for any food I buy, either. That's ridiculous."
725103,mike rousseau,2012-08-25 23:47:00,4661, I buy bulk and repack in ziploc before freezing.... I have 20+ pounds of ground beef... 10-15 steaks... 20 pounds of chicken breast... Etc...  So if I was someone who had to buy fish... I'd buy lots of it on sale and pack it in freezer bags...  Also... What would biological testing prove with store bought walleye...?  Aren't grocery store walleye wild fish caught by commercial fishing?
725105,mercman,2012-08-25 23:55:00,7054,  
725106,mercman,2012-08-25 23:59:00,7054,"  they can test, and determine what body of water the fish came from, but you would have to be a huge problem, before they would spend the money on surveillance and testing of your freezer contents."
725107,mike rousseau,2012-08-26 00:12:00,4661, So guys that fish waters that have commercial fishing could get away with it then....
725110,woodenboater,2012-08-26 00:26:00,2277,for family packs of meat and fish... vacuum bags > zip locs
725111,mercman,2012-08-26 00:47:00,7054, yup
725112,manitoubass2,2012-08-26 00:48:00,11391," ummmm, MNR do not have to obtain a search warrant to inspect your home/vehicle or boat"
725113,Muskieman,2012-08-26 00:49:00,2472,"HOLAY Wow ! I have a few friends that were nailed for "" freezer stocking "" they're not in a "" good situation""right now , one stands to lose a truck an boat , the other has been through the courts and it cost him 6500.00$ ..... Over limit is not to be seen in my freezer... never has , never will . A 4 person multi species limit in my freezer will feed 30 people with left overs ... easy ."
725118,Rich,2012-08-26 01:18:00,3927,"I asked the local CO's the question about the compelling ""grocery store bought"" argument, they said you'd have to provide a receipt, were they to have some compelling evidence to investigate somebody about this."
725119,Woodsman,2012-08-26 01:22:00,1286,I was waiting for someone to make that Bull comment. Although CO's have wide latitude to search without warrant it does not include your home also known as a dwelling under the Ontario Fish & Wildlife Act. Yes they will play off this common misconception to gain entry but they do not have that power. Read the actual Act. My link See: PART VIII - ENFORCEMENT
725122,manitoubass2,2012-08-26 01:26:00,11391,"  Good to know, thanks for the link!  Sorry for my bull"
725125,mercman,2012-08-26 01:30:00,7054,"  Thats ok Rick, we all spew the bull sometimes ......It makes life interesting."
725126,Rich,2012-08-26 01:30:00,3927,"Point of the post is, there are possession limits, not catch limits. Maybe this information was new to some people and they will stop stockpiling from now on, knowing its illegal. Thats better than arrests and enforcement, when people just know the law and abide by it? Maybe not use cheats and hoopla to get around it ""just a little bit""... Maybe just... Abide by it? Whether or not the MNR is gonna kick in your door. Thats the point."
725130,Woodsman,2012-08-26 01:40:00,1286,Also not mentioned is every resident in the house also has a possession limit. A valid license is not required as it is quite legal to gift fish to those without a license. Those with out a license have a possession limit equal to a sport fishing license but do not have a daily catch privileged. Those under 18 or over 64 are considered holders of a sport fishing license. Only one's not allowed a sport fishing license possession limit is those who hold a Conservation License.
