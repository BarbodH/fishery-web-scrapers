I have used www.Muskyshop.com before, and although they have a great selection...There were alot of  Fees that popped up last minute that leaves me looking for another source. Would rather not deal with the border if possible  I see Etackle.ca has alot of positive reviews....but ide like top see if there is anything else you guys use that has some more muskie specific selection  Anyone got any ides?  Thanks alot"
725870,Broker,2012-08-29 14:01:00,482,I'd go with etackle.
725872,Loadman,2012-08-29 14:10:00,63,JBs Fishing Depot has good Musky gear

725903,adempsey,2012-08-29 16:43:00,1498,"1) Used from the OFC classifieds or eBay.  Plenty of musky gear for sale all the time. 2) New, try some of the local guys like Handlebarz or Bondy Baits.  Probably a bunch of others. 3) Make some of your own.  You can make plenty of effective jigs and inline spinners.  Can get parts from places like Luremaking.com."
725912,Brettiop,2012-08-29 17:09:00,279," Bondy baits and Handlebarz are some of the baits im after, just wanna get it all in one swoop online to makes things easier...  Etackle is currently sold of handlebarz, thats another reason i was looking for other sites with lots of selection"
725913,Live2fish85,2012-08-29 17:21:00,1633, Message Mike P. he is the man to talk to about handlebarz as I believe he owns it and makes the baits.
725914,bigcreekdad,2012-08-29 17:22:00,546,Rollie and Helen's.....specializing In muskie tackle for years.

725918,Brettiop,2012-08-29 17:43:00,279," I mentioned that i have used this site before, great selection no doubt but was looking for something like this that is canadian  Pro tackle musky shop looks like a good bet so far..."
725921,Harrison,2012-08-29 17:55:00,2202,"Mike P is Mr Handlebarz, a great guy too.  We have another order going in for eTackle.ca from Mike soon.  Got to us a bit early Brettiop, just getting our Musky gear ordered and stocked up!  We were out on the weekend testing out a new prototype Suick, this and more coming soon."
725922,Roy,2012-08-29 18:00:00,13728,"You can also talk Bondy Baits (Jon Bondy) by PM. He's a member here. Display name here is ""Bondy'."
725928,Handlebarz,2012-08-29 18:25:00,3790,For woodie baits talk to outlaw he is a great friend and will help you out for sure.
725998,Gregoire,2012-08-29 23:06:00,1397,"As was mentioned I would message Mike P for handlebatz. If you are looking for other stuff I would go with pro tackle musky shop. Stacy is a great guy to deal with. Bass pro in Vaughan stocks bondy baits, but only the vertical jigging kind. JB's seems to be stocking less and less musky stuff every time I go in there."
726004,mike rousseau,2012-08-29 23:21:00,4661,I like Rollie and Helen's musky shop.... But I order to a USA address...
726017,Dan668,2012-08-29 23:57:00,1120,"Speaking of musky equipment, anyone know where i can get a stowmaster net? JB never seems to have any in stock"
726020,Gregoire,2012-08-30 00:03:00,1397,I think I saw one at sail in oshawa
726358,Brettiop,2012-08-31 17:38:00,279,"Thanks to everyone who helped out here,  I have an order ready to go for promuskytackleshop.com, and have talked to Mike p about ordering some of his handlebarz..."
