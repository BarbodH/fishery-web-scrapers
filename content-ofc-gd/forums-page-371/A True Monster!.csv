While the lake seemed dead (huge turn around from monday when it was on fire), it was just the calm before the storm. Suddenly while using a 9"" jerkbait the great beast appeared! Be prepared to be blown away everybody!    The ferocity!      The power!!!     THE EXHILARATION!!!!!           The result:      Well....I guess I wasn't skunked afterall! Snagged my first gar/minnow."
726562,Christopheraaron,2012-09-01 19:02:00,3525,It may not be a musky but cool looking fish!
726564,Dontcryformejanhrdina,2012-09-01 19:08:00,535,"Funny, I recently posted in the bucket list fish thread that I wanted to catch a gar. This wasn't exactly what I had in mind."

726569,The JAY,2012-09-01 19:42:00,239,I'm with spincast; what it lacks in size is more than made up for in the colourful pulmage!
726572,kickingfrog,2012-09-01 19:58:00,8333,Plumage?!
