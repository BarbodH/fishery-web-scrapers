726441,The JAY,2012-09-01 01:17:00,239,"Well, with the full moon upon us, I decided I'l go up to the Grand for a little smallie fishing. Short version: 2 and a half hours, 47 fish, the biggest was around the 4 Lb mark...  Longer version: As I've said, I have a trip to Lady Evelyn in...8 more sleeps  . I wanted to try out my light action rod with new line and some new jigs. The line totally sucked, and a big waste of $20, but the white jig and tails were a giant hit with the bass! They couldn't get enough of them. wading across the river I made a few casts into areas I expected a few little guys to be. 5 casts, 4 fish. Looks like I picked a good colour. None of them were huge, but all fought well above their 1Lb weight. Got over to the far shore and started wading my way to a honey hole I know. The fish were on fire, and getting bigger as they went. When I pullled the 3rd bass out of the hole I was working I saw a whole bunch of fish porpoising on the surface a little further up. Waded up to that point and proceeded to haul out a TON of big females. I don't know if female bass school up like that normally, but they were in there thick! Undoubtably it was my best night of smallie fishing, ever. Period. I must remember to charge the camera next time. All I got was 1 picture of a fish as they started to get bigger.  My hat's off to Phenix for their jig heads! Gammy hooks rock! "

726449,The JAY,2012-09-01 01:52:00,239,"It was the additude they gave me when I caught them!    No, I believe bass are like most fish, and the females tend to be larger. I could be wrong there though..."
726450,Live2fish85,2012-09-01 01:54:00,1633,"Yea I wouldn't go by that, not always true.The only way to tell is by there anal lol.  Nice job landing some nice fish."
726525,GBW,2012-09-01 15:13:00,8460,"SHHHHHH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Don't tell them all that...  It's bad enough when I buy in bulk from them I now have to order more as 4 others here want in on it too...  Oh, they know who they are..."

726571,The JAY,2012-09-01 19:44:00,239,"White has been the hot colour up there all year. The bass love 'em, and the 'eyes took them with a bit of a worm trailer.... I'm going to have to stock up... And buy new line again.... Grrr...."
