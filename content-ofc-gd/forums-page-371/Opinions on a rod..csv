726556,Spiel,2012-09-01 18:14:00,9065," Well it's always wise to get your guides as true as possible but as for having a them slightly off making a big difference in casting, I suspect not. Most factory rods I've seen could do a lot more to ensure the guides are straight.  Also popular these days are spiral wrapped rods (bait casting) and I've never had any complaints about them affecting casting."
726568,Oryx,2012-09-01 19:38:00,186,"Tried out the compre this morning. Loved it, also tried out the Veritas... It did not feel right to me.  I did not mind the 2 pc at all, guides were all lined up, and caught a couple of small largies throwing a spinnerbait."
726570,musky_hunter,2012-09-01 19:43:00,328,Spinning shouldn't be a problem. Maybe bc with micro guides.
726669,GBW,2012-09-02 14:33:00,8460,good to know
726794,gogu392,2012-09-03 01:15:00,142,"I did start fishing for a few years with spinning. By curiosity I did tried later casting. Now I am converted 100% The two spinning rods get dust. I got meanwhile 12 casting rods (2 are ice fishing). Even the light setup for perch and pan fish is baitcast. There are rods and reels that cover all the sizes, actions and s.o.   Best rods top:  1) G.Lomis (expensive) 2) St. Croix 3) Rapala 4) Bass Pro Carbon Lite  All rods 1 piece Best way to test a rod - get the hands on it and feel it. Have fun."
726163,Oryx,2012-08-30 17:26:00,186,"Alright, here goes.  I have used a spinning only set up all my life.  I am totally interested in baitcasting, and cant wait to try it! I have the reel already, thank you Gagnon's. A LH shimano Citica.  It was at the right price point, has decent reviews and I like how it reels.  Already spooled up with 30lb powerpro SS8 timber brown.  My dilemma now is which rod to get.  A 2 pc rod is a must, and would like medium heavy action.  So far the choices have been narrowed down to the Shimano Compre, Shimano Clarus and the Abu Garcia Veritas.  I feel I am leaning towards the Compre, as this is what I have holding up my stradic, but would like opinions on which to get. I have held them all, they all feel decent.... :wallbash:  Cheers   J"
726166,lookinforwalleye,2012-08-30 17:35:00,4399,"I don`t think you can go wrong with Shimano, I have several Shimano rods including a few Compre`s with no complaints. Great customer service from Shimano is a bonus!"
726168,GBW,2012-08-30 17:44:00,8460,"bring the reel to the store and test each rod out with the reel on it.  Me, I hated the Abu when I was looking for a new rod."
726171,mercman,2012-08-30 17:53:00,7054,"Bravo on the Citica.I have 2, and they are my Fav reels. Trully bulletproof.I have a number of makes of rods, and i tried a friends Veritas the other day.By far, more sensitive than my comparable Compre."
726173,Gregoire,2012-08-30 17:55:00,1397,"The veritas is a better rod at that price point IMO. The compre has a limited lifetime warranty. I agree with GBW, go to the store and try the reel on both rods and see which one feels better. If they are close decide whether the warranty (shimano) or quality (Abu) are more important."
726174,kickingfrog,2012-08-30 17:59:00,8333,"I'm all for sensitivity, but how much do you need in a baitcaster? In most cases the more sensitive a rod is the more fragile it will be. If I am mostly fishing fast, using cranks and spinerbaits I don't give much though to the sensitivity of the rod."
726177,adempsey,2012-08-30 18:10:00,1498,"I thought I read there were problems with those Veritas rods breaking??? Was I misinformed?    I agree with Kickingfrog on this as well, but I guess it depends on what the OP intends to use it for."
726180,mercman,2012-08-30 18:16:00,7054," I believe the verdict was the one with problems, but i could be wrong. I know i had a verdict and it broke at the ferrule. For me sensitivity is important, because i use bait caters for all my fishing styles, includeing finesse."
726187,Oryx,2012-08-30 19:03:00,186,"Thanks for all the input, I will be using it probably 50% of the time, for pretty much everything. texas to cranks to Spinnerbaits to Top water. As I only have 1 rod, and this will be my second, it will need to be a jack of all trades.   I love my Compre spinning Rod, and am leaning towards that one in the BC version. I know my options would be greatly increased if a 1 pc was doable, unfortunately, not too much in the 2 pc BC."
726198,bigbuck,2012-08-30 19:33:00,2449,What about st croix premier. Its gotta be close on the price point. I have a few and love them.
726234,mercman,2012-08-30 22:18:00,7054,7' MH Fast action is a good all round rod. It covers most applications.
726237,davey buoy,2012-08-30 22:30:00,5505," x2, 6'6' or 7'"
726242,mercman,2012-08-30 23:02:00,7054,"  I sure learned a whole lotta stuff in here in the past 2 years, huh?"
726244,SlowPoke,2012-08-30 23:18:00,2984,I'm partial to St. Croix myself but try the reel on a bunch of different rods. You'll fall in love with the rod that has the best balance for that reel. Another vote for 7' MHF for an all-around rod. I have a first generation Citica on a Compre rod and it's holding up well... combo purchased in '93
726323,DaveMc,2012-08-31 11:53:00,89," brought in a bunch last year and had issues with breaking on 3/4 of them, read some reviews stating the same as well."
726356,Oryx,2012-08-31 17:17:00,186,"thanks for all of the input guys!,  Went to BP at lunch and now own a 6'10 MH 2pc casting Compre.  Used up my Giftcard on this one and get to try her out tomorrow:clapping:"
726368,hotsky,2012-08-31 18:28:00,400,I'd recommend Abu Garcia villain rod.
726399,GBW,2012-08-31 21:33:00,8460,how come a 2pc though?
726402,ah_long,2012-08-31 21:37:00,354,"check out the Rapala R Type.. great warranty (in Oshawa), light rod..  Compre is a great choice as well"
726409,Oryx,2012-08-31 22:26:00,186," Need the 2 pc for space considerations, I drive a car that frequently has 2 small kids, and for storage....I keep my rods in a travel case from Sail."
726527,GBW,2012-09-01 15:17:00,8460,I see the point as I too have a car and kids but my kids know not to touch dad's fishing rods when in the car or van My only concern with a 2pc baitcaster rod is that if it's not alligned 100% then your casting distance will drop big time.  for that reason I still went with a 1pc for all my BC rod's.
726528,Spiel,2012-09-01 15:26:00,9065, Seriously.
726542,musky_hunter,2012-09-01 16:50:00,328,"i started with 2 pcs rods as they were more convenient, after asking aroudn and trying different rods i switched to all 1 pcs.  the best 2 pcs rod i have ever used was a St. Croix Legend Elite."
726549,hungryforpike,2012-09-01 17:17:00,46,"Do NOT buy an Abu Veritas..they are known for breaking. I dare you to google ""veritas broken""..you'll be there for hours. I replaced the veritas that broke on me with a St. Croix premier..very, very nice piece for an ""off the shelf"" rod.  HFP"
726551,GBW,2012-09-01 17:34:00,8460,Yeah.  I make sure my 2pc spinning are in line as best as I can get and if they aren't I can tell from the casting distance.  I wouldn't want a BC one (known for distance) to be hampered by it not being in line
