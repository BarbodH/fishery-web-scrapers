726516,scugpg,2012-09-01 12:40:00,1373,"I'm looking at buying a gas pressure washer for general use. Looks like lots of options in the 4-500 range but not sure where to start looking. Thinking around 2500-3000 psi. Not sure if they vary significantly noise wise so quieter is preferred. Also hoping to find one that has or can have a smaller gun attachment similar to a regular garden hose gun or a bit bigger(maybe this can be purchased separately at PA etc?). Most I've seen have a 2yr warranty.  I figured some folks have them on here, so looking for your recommendation.  Thanks"
