Yup, I fell out of the boat. No biggie but I did get completly soaked was in about 5 feet of water. I am glad I had a spare starter rope in the boat kit I keep, even though mine is an electric start.  So... my word of advice... keep a spare rope in your gear for your trolling motor.  The day went along pretty good and I was able to hook into this big girl. I weighed it on a digital and won't post the weight, cause I know how people love to start crap here for no real good reason. I will say this is my yearly PB for a bucket,and I have caught several 5's this year prior to this one.  "

726743,jedimaster,2012-09-02 19:53:00,3472,"Thanks, and I'll tell yah this, when it broke, I was utterly helpless. I ended up jumping so I could land on my feet, because I knew I was going in. Sorry for the blackout on the pic, but the shoreline is recognizable and I was pre-fishing for a tourney... hopefully she is still around next weekend."
726745,mike rousseau,2012-09-02 19:54:00,4661,I keep extra rope in the boat for just that reason....

726763,jedimaster,2012-09-02 20:49:00,3472,"rofl, the Black Fog of Lost Lake coming to theaters near you. I didn't feel too bad about the rope, because I am almost certain that I am not the only one put in the lake or the keister from a broken one."
