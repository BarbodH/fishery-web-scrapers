724826,kemper,2012-08-24 18:06:00,2232,"My quiver of long sticks continues to grow - although this time in a different method.  My latest project is a 13'6"" Rainshadow RX7 Spey rod (IST1369-4). Its a skagit cannon, grain window 600-650 and I can't wait to tame some Huron chrome with it.  Here's the pictures - will update with more as I get close to finishing up. This morning I managed to get all the guides wrapped, so all that's left is flex coat.             Cheers,"
724828,I'mHooked,2012-08-24 18:12:00,525,"Hey great looking rod, love the cork. Look out Spiel!"
724858,Jet,2012-08-24 19:33:00,364,Very sweet looking design Kemper. You might have to plan a trip out this way to really break it in!
724860,kemper,2012-08-24 19:44:00,2232, Don't have to twist my arm too much one that one...  I think I'll give myself a season to learn how to not snag myself in the ars before getting too ambitious though
724863,bare foot wader,2012-08-24 19:58:00,1354,"nice handle work, well done, what guides did you wrap on?  those are nice reels too...definitley a skagit cannon, when you visit BC make sure you explore squamish/whistler area, well suited stick for those rivers"
724865,misfish,2012-08-24 20:00:00,29133,"Yep,love that handle design.SWEET looking rod."
724878,Broker,2012-08-24 20:55:00,482,That cork looks awesome! Great looking rod
724927,Ralph Field,2012-08-25 00:02:00,1018,That is one impressive rod!
724929,Live2fish85,2012-08-25 00:30:00,1633,"Great work. The cork is nice to.  I can't wait till I get my custom fly rod, only a month or so till then."
724952,kemper,2012-08-25 03:06:00,2232," Stripping guides are zirconium ring with TiCh frame, snake guides are TiCh too."
725026,Spiel,2012-08-25 17:28:00,9065," You could be right.  Great work Kemper, looking forward to some pictures of the finished rod and of course some reports on it's success."
725033,kemper,2012-08-25 18:16:00,2232," Thanks for the input on the wrap color Spiel, it's looking great"
725035,Spiel,2012-08-25 18:21:00,9065, My pleasure Sir.   It'll look awesome finished without CP (or with) I'm sure.
725165,kemper,2012-08-26 04:15:00,2232,"No cp, it's turning nicely on the rack as we speak."
725862,kemper,2012-08-29 13:41:00,2232,"An update - rod is complete now less some detailing (blank info between hook keeper wrap and detail wrap above handle) that I'm going to leave until the deep of winter when I get bored.  Here's a couple pictures - will try to get better ones in the daylight - finding it difficult to get good shots of the threadwraps...      I had a minor problem on the first two sections - something on the new brush polluted my flex coat and left a bit of cloudiness. The thread seems to have mostly soaked it up, and after a second coat it really isn't noticeable unless under direct artificial light.  This is by far my most ""polished"" build, but at the same time still a long way from where I would like to be. I find that I run out of patience quickly for wrapping guides, and make some mistakes on the trim bands that I simply don't care to fix.  Cheers, Kemper"
725865,Spiel,2012-08-29 13:43:00,9065,You done well Kemper.
725867,kemper,2012-08-29 13:53:00,2232,"Maybe a spec sheet would interest some people...  I build almost exclusively on Batson blanks - I've had nothing but excellent experiences and  I have a great supplier with even better prices.  Blank: Rainshadow RX7 IF1369-4 Reel Seat: Heavy Duty Spey, Aluminium, Double locking - Gunsmoke (RA 8.5L2-SG) Winding Check: .453 Aluminium winding check Hook Keeper - Ti Carb keeper Stripper Guides - Batson XTCMXNZG (TiCh, Zirconium ring, chrome gunsmoke finish) (20, 16, 12) Snake Guides - Batson XTCHSNGP (TiCH, Chrome gunsmoke finish) (6,5,5,4,4,4,4,4,4,4) Tip Top - Batson XTCFTL 6.0  Everything but the blank and the cork comes from a great supplier out west.

My last build the shipment was lost somewhere and they sent me out a new order at no extra charge right away.  I'm not sure about forum rules on posting non-sponsor links, so I'll remove if needed."
726006,misfish,2012-08-29 23:23:00,29133,"Funny how OFC gets around eh. Kemp,I fished a local riv on sunday and met up with a riv fella. He had a king pin, and I was asking about it,as I am looking at buying one. Long talk short,he started talking about Spey fishing. I had said there was a member on a site that just built one.He tells me Spey fishing is awesome. I asked about how you fish it.It was a bit like fly fishing,and pining combined.Thats what I took from it. Did some you tube search, and I like this style. (dont tell the mrs,s)More money to spend.LOL  Very nice build."
726010,steel&chrome,2012-08-29 23:31:00,46,Wicked Spey build! Very appealing! Thanks for sparking some interest in spey fishing by the way!!
726035,MJL,2012-08-30 00:52:00,2427,"Nicely done Brady!  I haven’t bit the bullet yet on a spey rod of my own yet but hopefully this fall I can get a spey or switch rod done – Last fall I had a great time swinging flies on one G-bay river using my friend’s spey rods in 5-7wts. It’s hard to beat throwing and swinging half a chicken to large, aggressive steelhead – especially when they’re rising for dries . Eagerly waiting to get both the new 6 and 7wt Sage One spey and switch rods in my hands before I make the final decision."
726058,spinnerdoc,2012-08-30 03:25:00,556,"I really like the rear grip length, actually that is my preferred rear grip on my float rod. I just put together a switch rod set up hoping to give it a try this season, Went out to practice and the flies are whizzing few inches from my ears  Congrats on a job well done bud"
726060,kemper,2012-08-30 03:36:00,2232," Thanks, man.  Next project is a lighter one, for those times when chucking an entire turkey isn't needed. If I really get into this game a sage might be in the cards... But until then I can't turn away the excellent price and product I get from batson."
726061,kemper,2012-08-30 03:38:00,2232,"Thanks!  Length might be a bit deceiving, overall too long for a float rod in my opinion... Tapes out around 24 inches with only a 5.5 rear grip reason for the length is my natural grip width is fairly wide."
726305,spinnerdoc,2012-08-31 04:01:00,556,"Funny you say that I think mine is a tad shorter than 5.5 and I've had a few guys tell me it's too far back to their liking, every one's different. The switch rod I have is a bit too short to my liking, (perhaps i need to learn to cast properly) , it's the wind warrior. Yours would be awesome to cast with all day  Is that a wind warrior reel?"
726334,kemper,2012-08-31 12:53:00,2232," The reel is a Hardy - not exactly the tool for the job but I got a deal I couldn't pass up. Likely I'll end up building a lighter spey rod and swap the Hardy on, and buy a heavier reel for this set-up.  I would really struggle with a rear grip that short on my float rod...I would think it would be really hard on the wrist because there is nothing to anchor under your forearm?"
