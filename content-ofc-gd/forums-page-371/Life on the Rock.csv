726670,Joeytier,2012-09-02 14:34:00,3990,Awesome shots.  First two fish are cod?
726682,pokerdemon4,2012-09-02 15:35:00,135,Yes those are codfish. There were some big fish caught here. They have what's called a food fishery here. It was open for three weeks and is now closed. Its open again for a week at the end of September. Normally the fish are even bigger at that time of year.
726694,Sinker,2012-09-02 16:10:00,8692,"Yes 'bye! Good fish for sure! NICE trout!!  We had a hard time getting big cod like that for the first week I was down, but the second week we hammered them! Lots of fun on a med spinning set up, with 20lb braid  Your living the life my friend! I had a real hard time leaving!! Find me a job, and I will be back in a heartbeat!! Next time your up on the main land, get in touch! Always an open seat for ya buddy!!  S."

726722,misfish,2012-09-02 18:18:00,29133," Yep,I,m all packed Simon. What time are we leaving"
726723,Sinker,2012-09-02 18:25:00,8692,"  I did plenty of that too Brian, no worries. It was more fun on the rod though, and I was getting bigger fish too  I was down there for two weeks, when the food fishery opened. Fished every day but two. I brought home about 70lbs of fresh cod fillets  :) Everything I ate while I was there came from the land or sea as well. No store bought meat the whole trip!!  S."
726731,davey buoy,2012-09-02 18:46:00,5505, Well it doesn't get any better than that does it!!!
726749,Sinker,2012-09-02 20:02:00,8692,"  NOPE! I had a real hard time leaving! I was planning on visiting pokerdemon, but there just isn't enough time in a life to do it all!!  S."

726911,pokerdemon4,2012-09-03 18:12:00,135,This is on the northern peninsula. Out of Canada Bay. I was fishing this morning with nothing to show. I'm am packing away the trout and salmon gear and gettin my shotgun ready for other table fare. Hopefully we can bag a moose next weekend as well. Too bad we couldn't hook up Sinker! When I get back you will have to show me how to shoot those duckies of yours!
726926,Sinker,2012-09-03 19:54:00,8692,I have an open seat for ya anytime bud!!  S.
727013,esoxansteel,2012-09-03 22:55:00,1307,"Hows that fly rod workin, hoping its serving you well der lad"
727027,pokerdemon4,2012-09-03 23:33:00,135,"That rod is a gem! It has a little stiffer action than most fly rods which makes it a great caster. It's a tough rod too, I wasn't babying it. Great for fighting strong fish. It should work great on steelhead too. Thanks for the deal on it! I appreciate it."
