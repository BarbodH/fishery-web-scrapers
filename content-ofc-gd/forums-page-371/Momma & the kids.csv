The lady let out a yell and the 3 cubs scampered up the nearest tree with momma close behind.  She then grabbed the pooch and put him in the house,  got her camera and took this picture of the 4 bears in the tree, although the 3rd cub is hidden behind momma.  Not really big news, but kinda unusual at 2:00 in the afternoon.  Anyhoo, just thought some may find it interesting.  "

In my experience the dog was barking from a short distance, momma bear let out a noise & instantly the 3 cubs scampered up nearby trees.  The momma stayed on the ground to fend off the dog.  Interesting to see mother nature at work.  Don't ever think if u encounter a bear that by climbing a tree you'll be safe.  They r extrememly fast tree climbers.  Maybe false info here.  Whether they would chase u up a tree I'm not sure!!"
