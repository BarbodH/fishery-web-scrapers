726337,bucktail,2012-08-31 13:13:00,1857,Wondering if anyone has been out on Erie's east end for eyes recently. I havnt been out since early July and would appreciate a general area to start in. I assume they have kept moving out and down since then.  Any help would be appreciated.  Darren

A pretty good location east of the weather marker off Port Colborne,don`t have many other details because I was heading to Burwell.With the big wind they might really be scattered again. Good luck if you go!"
