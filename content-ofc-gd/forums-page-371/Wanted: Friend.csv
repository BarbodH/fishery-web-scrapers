726578,misfish,2012-09-01 21:10:00,29133," LOL Brudder   No this was when I first moved to Barrie. I was a fishing crazy guy then. Fished when ever I could. Thats why I moved up here. One day I was fishing the marina,and this older fella was launching his boat. I gave him a hand tieing it up,and watched it for him as he parked the truck and trailer. When he returned,he asked if I would like to join him. Why sure,and the rest is history.  This didnt work all the time,as some would just say thanks and be on their way."
