Police say the men were trolling in the Big Bay Point area when a wave came over the stern of the boat causing it to take on water. The pair did not have time to locate and don their life jackets and were forced to abandon the sinking vessel. Using a set of boat seats and a plastic cooler as a flotation device the pair started to swim the nearly one kilometre to shore. The duo were spotted by a passing boater who took them aboard and drove them the rest of the way to shore. Police say their vessel is a complete loss."
