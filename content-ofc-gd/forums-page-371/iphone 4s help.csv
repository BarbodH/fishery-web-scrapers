726636,mike rousseau,2012-09-02 12:11:00,4661,Email them to your computer...  Of your doing a lot of pics... There IS a better way but I forget how...
726638,Terry,2012-09-02 12:18:00,14456,"plug charging cable into usb port on computer , itunes, syc or transfer....done"
726639,mike rousseau,2012-09-02 12:23:00,4661,  its different with pics terry... its not just a one click thing... if i remember right....
726640,Terry,2012-09-02 12:29:00,14456,ok  click on my computer click on iphone open photo folder could be named DCIM cut paste or drag  I have a ipod not iphone but should be close to the same
726654,woodenboater,2012-09-02 13:37:00,2277,"If yer using Mac...  -connect iPhone to computer via USB  -launch Preview app  -File --> ""Import from <insert name of phone>  -select the ones you want to move  -choose or create a destination folder, then hit ""Import"" or ""Import All""  This still leaves the photos on the iPhone so you'll need to go in and trim them manually if you want to make room on your device"

726675,super dave,2012-09-02 14:39:00,323,Lou.  I do what Terry does.  Works on my 4 so it should with 4s
726713,drwxr,2012-09-02 17:23:00,453,icloud
726754,PAZE,2012-09-02 20:22:00,132,"If you own a Mac photo stream, and you never have to plug anything in. If you have a PC you can Icloud it. or if your grasping at straws LOL plug in your little white cord that came with it into your USB port and hold on tight it pretty much does it for you."
726758,northernpike56,2012-09-02 20:37:00,717,"My little sister uses iCloud with her 4S. I have a blackberry (see POS), and I plug my connector/USB into my PC and can open and view all my files on my PC.. I would think that your 4S would be the same if you don't have iCloud."
726836,aniceguy,2012-09-03 09:34:00,1094,thanks Gents I ll try the methods and let ya know
726843,musky_hunter,2012-09-03 13:02:00,328,iCloud would be the easiest and quickest way. If not email.
726853,Terry,2012-09-03 14:05:00,14456,"just remember that emailing photos and icloud use up data plans ..if you have a good data plan or you transfer when you have wifi connection, then fine  but I find if you have to ask the question then the cheapest and safest way is the best way to tell them to do it and plugging it into the computer seems simple to me...... if he had it set up for cloud and photo stream and had the control panel on his computer, you would think he would already know about all that kiss works best for most"
727198,aniceguy,2012-09-04 13:10:00,1094,the methods mentioned via import dont work........it will sync to a file on my pc but wont download from the phone to the pc grrrr
