726299,STJ,2012-08-31 03:01:00,12,Just wondering if there are any walleye being caught with all this warm weather? I have some time off and I would like to get a bit of practice in before the fall run starts. I have heard they are out deep in Erie but i don't have enough boat for that.  Thanks

726552,STJ,2012-09-01 18:00:00,12,"I am north of Guelph but I travel all over. The GRAC reservoirs are getting pretty low and the fish are boiled with this hot weather. Just looking to get out on some bigger water as I wait for the fall season to begin. I think the walleye and perch in Erie are still pretty far out, thinking of the Kawartha lakes for this week.  "
