726332,ttahhan,2012-08-31 12:45:00,191,So i ventured out to Port Credit this morning casted out my glow in dark and first cast smash 22 lb Chinook Hen (Released) everyone around me had a fish or two during the time i was there. so 6:30am hit i decided to start heading to the car there's a little bay after the mouth. It looked good so i tied on a Zara Spook first cast something came up i through it back same area slow retrieve and smash 3 lb SMB grabbed it. I continued working this area i saw a pike come up for it but did not hit it. Anyhow that was my fun before the masses arrive today. It also puts an extra smile on my face when bass and pike are found within the city limits.... Everybody enjoy your long weekend....Im sure Sunday-Monday theres gonna be echos of pictures from the weekend cant wait to see....
