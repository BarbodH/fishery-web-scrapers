The last few springs have taught me that this is the time of year when there is a true awakening and fish of all species go on an absolute feeding frenzy.  This period of prime time fishing may be shorter in the spring than in the fall but it's definitely way more intense.  My spring fishing season began in early May on a cold, windy, and snowy morning. This nice 20 inch rainbow made it all worth it. "

1004973,Walleye'm Fishing,2017-05-30 14:32:00,310,Thanks again gang. I got out for a couple of hours with my buddy last night. The fishing was a little slower than in recent outings. The highlight of the night was when we landed this nice double header!
