1004559,Tjames09,2017-05-25 21:30:00,664,"The previous condition of the boat should have no bearing on the finished product. If it's a gut job then so be it  More about the guys comment of its worse than when he brought it, which obviously isnt the case.  I understand the previous condition has no bearing on the final product. The guys work is obviously unskilled and a hack job and Im sure he has very little knowledge of how to actually do boat work."
1004564,leaf4,2017-05-25 21:37:00,2466,"Uh that's debatable, it didn't have screws through the hull before he brought it in, and now he's left with garbage that needs to be torn out. If it were me in his shoes, yes it's worse than when he brought it in because the entire thing needs to be gutted AGAIN."
1004572,bare foot wader,2017-05-25 22:15:00,1354,"the way I read the FB post and screenshot of buddy's text message, the client brought trimmed out his boat, trimmed out gutted the boat down bare bones and then sent that picture to the client to show the condition under the flooring before he starts rebuilding...so can't really gauge if the boat is actually in better or worse shape than before, but I sure wouldn't be taking trimmed out opinions for full value......but maybe I've interpreted that wrong?  and that picture doesn't seem all that bad to me...it's a bunch of grime and rotten foam, most older boats look about the same when you get the floor off....I'd seriously question if trimmed out boats re-poured foam, or just left it, or worse ripped it out and now there's no safety floatation  either way buddy didn't get 4k worth of work done, and if that was just a deposit, I'd hate to know how much the rest of the bill was.....that entire boat needs to be gutted and rebuilt again"
1004583,GBW,2017-05-25 22:37:00,8460,"I had seen another customer post a video today on FB of his boat and well, if it didn't have rot before it sure does now...  Trying to find the video..."
1004591,Carp,2017-05-25 23:12:00,1488,"I'm guessing Trimmed Out Boats is too busy and had to hire an inexperienced person to work on this boat. Or, he did a rush job to get the owner off his back. Probably didn't even realize the screws had punctured through the hull.  Definitely not worth $4000. I don't think I'd pay that much for the whole boat."
1004594,moxie,2017-05-26 00:10:00,1566,That's crazy. Hope it all gets figured out. For all parties involved. Wow!
1004610,NANUK,2017-05-26 02:33:00,797,"Horriable work !! I remember years ago a marina hired a summer student, they asked him to install a battery charger in the port side rod locker, young lad screwed it right through the hull in customer's brand new boat."
1004657,206,2017-05-26 15:50:00,563,Hate to say I know the owner of trimmedoutboats and have not got to speak to Jeff yet but have heard the guy posting the video put those screws threw himself?? Hense why he hasn't contacted a lawyer.  I'd like to hear all 3 sides to the story lol
1004662,bare foot wader,2017-05-26 16:32:00,1354,and another video pops up...  https://www.facebook.com/100005402651890/videos/694290700761012/

1004700,leaf4,2017-05-26 22:32:00,2466,"That's brutal....  (Not to you just in general) I really doubt the owner of the boat put 3"" wood screws into his own boat, sure seems like something a crackhead would do though!"
1004713,buick14,2017-05-27 01:36:00,741,"This new video seems suspect to me, 1 week turnaround to redo and beef up that rotted transom? I dunno... However , I feel the original video and person is authentic, and I also believe that the rebuilder is a crack-head!!!"
1004725,Rizzo,2017-05-27 12:13:00,4754,Truly unbelievable...I could do better work and I am useless

1004792,leaf4,2017-05-28 13:27:00,2466,"Yeah I saw that too... That's ridiculous he has no business being in the boat restoration business putting out crap like this,and even ruining the guys comfortrol by using his as a mold for others to sell."
1004952,buick14,2017-05-30 10:39:00,741,"^ he deleted his little statement / post. He will continue with his business, and is expecting this to blow over. When the heat cools down, he will go back to ripping people off."

1004445,boombap,2017-05-25 03:02:00,310,The screws through the hull.... how?!?
1004446,GBW,2017-05-25 03:13:00,8460,Yeah I know eh?!?!!?  Maybe they are a new secret weapon when beaching a boat to attach it to a log on shore...
1004447,porkpie,2017-05-25 03:32:00,2521,Well that's something you don't see every day.

1004453,fishindevil,2017-05-25 10:02:00,6254,:asshat:yes I seen the vid on FB and I would be going ballistic .....that's unreal for sure......
1004455,buick14,2017-05-25 10:34:00,741,How much did u pay? What exactly did u have them do?  I watched the video but with no sound wife's asleep Nice oversized screws for the latches lol
1004456,leaf4,2017-05-25 10:52:00,2466,"Yeah that's brutal... The guy paid 4k up front, it was 7 weeks late as well as the work being terrible. Also he was supposed to be getting vinyl floor not carpet"
1004459,Fishwilly,2017-05-25 11:25:00,206,OMG I'm so anal about babying my rig !! I'd be livid. ??Maybe he's right about the owner being a crackhead lol
1004464,grimsbylander,2017-05-25 11:48:00,3016,"I saw this last night when my friend shared the video on FB. I think I was have called a lawyer as opposed to the commentary in the video but I can certainly see why he was upset. I'm wondering how the exchange went when he picked up the boat? Would you not normally inspect it and then pay the balance? Maybe I missed that part...but yes, I'd loose my mind. This Trimmed Out Boats business advertises on Kijiji all the time."
1004465,buick14,2017-05-25 11:58:00,741,"Ya im interested to hear the story about when you picked it up ?  I assume he was not there, and left it outside for you to pick up  I watched it with sound.  Royal pee off I'm mad for you"

1004480,Musky Plug,2017-05-25 14:05:00,398,"The screws through the hull, how did that happen? They looked like the icing on the cake from all the other work that was done. The guy who did the work sounds like an absolute beauty."
1004484,buick14,2017-05-25 14:18:00,741,Hahahah I wonder how many times this video has been emailed to him through his kijiji ad !

1004493,Headhunter,2017-05-25 14:55:00,5703,"At least he could have used the stainless screws through the hull, so they won't rust! What a buffoon! HH"

Actually don't tell me to do anything, If 4000 meant anything to him he would have asked around, read reviews, seen work that was done bye him at his shop, any other place would have been 6000, he was just horned up to go boating, cheap as possible, if something is to good to be true it probably is, pretty sure he's failing to show the state of the boat before, he says it's worse I highly doubt it,  "
1004511,leaf4,2017-05-25 16:05:00,2466,The previous condition of the boat should have no bearing on the finished product. If it's a gut job then so be it

It was all over my FB feeds yesterday is all.  And yeah if it was a gut it and rebuild then that pic is null and void as the owner was paying for a rebuild the way he wanted it... vinyl and the screws he provided"
1004518,DRIFTER_016,2017-05-25 17:20:00,10439,"Yup, I saw it. If it was my boat his shop would be a smouldering pile of ash today with the owner nicely BBQ'd in the middle of the pile. This is why I'm glad I have the skills to this kind of thing myself and don't need to rely on others."
1004521,mistaredone,2017-05-25 17:41:00,913,That sucks!  ive calmed down over the years but I can't imagine how that pick up would have gone. $4000 hard earned dollars.
1004524,buick14,2017-05-25 17:48:00,741,"Man I'll take the before picture and $4000  What is unexplainable is the screws through the hull.  Even the crappy cuts, how much harder is it to take a little extra to complete the cuts properly ? I mean the boat was junk before, but come on.  Take the extra day towards the quality , and charge him $200 more .  How you could let that leave your shop like that is beyond me.  The screws through the front really give me no sympathy to trimmed out."
1004532,Pigeontroller,2017-05-25 18:15:00,2793,"As bad as that job is, who gives a $4000 deposit for a job that shouldn't exceed...Dare I say $4000! And who doesn't get some references in this day and age??? I would want to see some prior work before I let someone redo my boat. And if that company was anything at all they'd have a real website instead of just a FB page!  Thats why I spent all winter doing mine, I wouldn't trust anyone else!"
