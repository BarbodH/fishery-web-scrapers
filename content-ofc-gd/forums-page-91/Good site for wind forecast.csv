1004767,John Bacon,2017-05-27 23:52:00,3277,Does anyone have any recommended sites for wind forecasts?  I have see forecasts for under 5km and over 20km for tomorrow morning.  That is a pretty big difference for a wind out of east on Lake Ontario.
1004768,spincast,2017-05-27 23:57:00,3279,"I find this one is right about 95% of the time - and when its wrong - so are all the others.   Just be sure to select the super-forecast view, as it is often quite different from the forecast. https://www.windfinder.com/weatherforecast/grimsby_ontario Currently set for the Grimsby Buoy, but you can do a search based on the lake / area you are fishing"
1004785,mike rousseau,2017-05-28 11:16:00,4661,I use Windfinder and they seem to be the most accurate I have found
1004790,mitch seguin,2017-05-28 12:44:00,98,My go to is www.windguru.cz
1004795,dave524,2017-05-28 14:26:00,4508,"https://www.windy.com/?43.632,-79.761,7"
1004797,grimsbylander,2017-05-28 14:31:00,3016,I use sailflow...The map is good for visualizing the change in wind direction.
1004798,4x4bassin,2017-05-28 15:12:00,1025,I use them all but like windguru the best .
1004803,misfish,2017-05-28 16:08:00,29133,"I have been using, www.wunderground.com. It,s been pretty good to me. Today it was bang on."
1004977,fishindevil,2017-05-30 14:53:00,6254,another vote for windguru
1004981,JoshS,2017-05-30 16:21:00,729,"If I need to I'll look at a few of them and take an average. But for a quick fix I like windfinders phone app. Never knew about the windfinder ""superforecast"" however as spincast mentions above."
1005003,John Bacon,2017-05-30 18:40:00,3277,"Thanks, for the info.  I guess I should have got up early on Sunday."
1005017,Tjames09,2017-05-30 19:47:00,664,weather underground is pretty accurate for me.
1005020,misfish,2017-05-30 20:14:00,29133,"Thanks, for the info.  I guess I should have got up early on Sunday.  Im always up early and on the water just at light John. Get my fix in while I can."
