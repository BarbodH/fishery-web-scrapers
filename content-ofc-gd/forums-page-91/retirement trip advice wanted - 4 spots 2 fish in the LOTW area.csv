1005157,scuro2,2017-06-01 03:29:00,904,"Having never been to to LOTW I wondered what those who have been to LOTW area would think of 4 good and different spots to fish to get a feel for both the fishing and the different landscapes of the region. If asked for Southern Ontario I might suggest, the Ottawa river, Kesagami, Lake St. Clair, and Manitoulin.I've heard good things about Pipestone, and Lac Seul. Shoal lake looks less developed. Looking forward to your suggestions"
1005169,Sinker,2017-06-01 13:18:00,8692,You could spend a lifetime on LOTW alone. I'm headed up there in 30 days. Friend of mine just bought a lodge there. I can't wait!!  S.
1005171,manitoubass2,2017-06-01 13:44:00,11391,"Pat Boyd???  Lake of the woods is unreal man.  Pipestone chain is really good too. Lots of good walleye, bass and big pike. Even Lakers  But I'd stick to LOTWs and maybe hit some of the backlake nearby for fun. Kegaki is really fun to visit. Tons of Lakers in there and you can sight fish at 90 feet deep lol"

1005174,Sinker,2017-06-01 13:56:00,8692,Yup. My better half is working there for the summer. She went up on monday. I'm solo for the summer....  S.
1005175,manitoubass2,2017-06-01 14:03:00,11391,"Wow, pretty cool! Looks like he has the camp in fantastic shape too and Pat is a great guy!  I've been thinking about visiting this summer as well.  Your better half is gonna be in heaven lol"
1005176,Sinker,2017-06-01 14:06:00,8692,"Yes, she is in heaven. I'm pretty jealous!  I will be there the first week of July for 10 days. Come by then."
1005179,manitoubass2,2017-06-01 14:18:00,11391,"I can try!  I'll talk to Pat, if it's a no go I'll just pop in possibly lol  (Provided my health is better at the time)"
1005180,manitoubass2,2017-06-01 14:19:00,11391,You'll love it there! One of the best areas of LOTWs IMO
1005186,Acountdeleted,2017-06-01 15:41:00,2562,"Little bit of a trip but when I worked up there I loved Bluffy Lake in Ear Falls. If Keith and his wife are still running the camp there, you will never meet nicer people. I think the lodge and lake were featured on a fishing show a couple of times. The walleye fishing there is unreal with some big pike as well."
1005189,manitoubass2,2017-06-01 15:58:00,11391," I think it's called sleepy dog cabins, about 20mins south or ear falls"
1005250,misfish,2017-06-02 22:05:00,29133,I'm solo for the summer....  S.  Lucky bugger. LOL  Enjoy your trip bye.
