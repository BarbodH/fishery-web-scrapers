1004984,Sterling,2017-05-30 17:06:00,477,How do you like them dipsies?
1004994,Freshtrax,2017-05-30 18:02:00,2215,Red in particular? Or dipsies in general?   We catch more than 50 percent of our fish on dipsies.
1004995,Sterling,2017-05-30 18:07:00,477,"Red in particular? Or dipsies in general? We catch more than 50 percent of our fish on dipsies.  Yeah, dipsies in general. I tend to run them when the water's too rough to mess with riggers."
1005001,Freshtrax,2017-05-30 18:36:00,2215,I always have a dipsie in the water with a paddle and fly.   On sat fish wouldn't touch the riggers dipsies took all 4 fish. Usually run them on a 2 setting with 150- 250 ft of line out
1005007,BillM,2017-05-30 19:03:00,17367,"Same here..  2 dipsies with SD/flies, 2 riggers with spoons + cheaters."
1005013,huzzsaba,2017-05-30 19:31:00,884,I always have a dipsie in the water with a paddle and fly. On sat fish wouldn't touch the riggers dipsies took all 4 fish. Usually run them on a 2 setting with 150- 250 ft of line out that setup was the one that caught both last year when we went.
