I was wondering if any of you have some advice for me? I'm relatively novice when it comes to angling, mostly using worms as bait since lures have never been very effective for me. However I would like to give lures a try, and they seem to be effective with the right techniques. I'll mostly be targeting large mouth bass and small mouth bass. I'll have a boat for some days, other days I'll be relying on a motor less aluminum boat and canoe. Super excited to have a nice little vacation on the lake!  Are there any lures for bass that you could suggest that would be good to get started on? I'll be there for a week, so some variety will be nice to have as I plan to get on the water as much as possible.  Any techniques/strategy you can give would be much appreciated as well.  Thanks in advance!"

Spend $100 on a variety of the mentioned baits and you will have a good start. Bass aren't super picky. Big ones are harder to catch consistently. I've never fished Baptiste but I imagine that working shoreline structure and the edges of weed beds would be your best bet for action. Good luck and have fun on your vacation."

Shallow areas you can use a soft plastic jerk bait  to imitate a minnow.  There are not a lot of weeds in the lake, but work them good when you find them."

That was the plan. Spend about $100-$150 to get started. Appreciate the tips!"

Won't leave those weed beds once I find them haha. I'll have to pick up some soft plastic minnows too then! Thanks!"

I've never targeted Pike, but would be interested in trying! I have no idea where to get started however. I've only caught one once by accident haha. "
1004920,mistaredone,2017-05-29 23:26:00,913,"Use a steel leader even when bass fishing baptiste. Lots of small pike.  White spinner bait around the stumps and logs, Small Zara spook for the shallow rock reefs, silver mepps #2 to cast the shore line and your set. 15-20lb line because you'll find lots of snags.  I'll pm you a map that a guy named John Bacon sent me 16 years ago that got me going. Have a great time!"

Texas rigging a soft plastic lure, it works on worms, lizards, tubes, and others. They make rubber pegs to keep the weight from sliding or a round toothpick can be used. Adjust the weight and hook size to the size of the lure and water depth.    Carolina rigs    Jig and worm, better in areas with less weeds and junk, the hook is exposed and hookup percentages are better.    Jig and craw.    Tube with a tube jig insert."

It's all faily shallow and weedy north that narrows.  The water is pretty deep in your area."
