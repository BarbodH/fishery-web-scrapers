I had been busy with my other passion which is running. Since my last actual fishing trip post. I have ran 3 full marathons which is 42.2 km each and 18 other road races.  However since my last race I decided to finally get back out fishing while I rest up and get ready for the next round. So with that I'm hoping to be more active on the site again and on the waters this year. I just hope I have better luck then how musky opener went where I got skunked.  I was so out of practice  I couldn't even catch the panfish at shore   .  I can say one thing about my fishing in the last two years. 1) I can count on one hand how many times I actually got out fishing and 2) I can count on one finger how many fish I've caught in that time  With that I'm looking forward to getting back to it and hoping there will be some of the "" colorful"" stories that I remember having a chuckle over here and there in the past.
