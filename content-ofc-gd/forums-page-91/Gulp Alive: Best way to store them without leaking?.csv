1004871,PUMP KNOWS,2017-05-29 17:10:00,937,What do you guys use to store Gulp Alive products?  I bought some 3inch grubs and I plan on storing them in urinal containers.  I have some 5inch minnows but I'm not sure how to store them.  I double bagged them before but they would still leak.
1004872,captpierre,2017-05-29 17:32:00,2521,How are they different than the ones you buy in a bag. And keep well as long as the bags are sealed.
1004873,AKRISONER,2017-05-29 17:33:00,5558,"frig gulp alive and their containers...i literally just wrap the hell outta mine in like 3 plastic bags and just deal with it leaking everywhere. I try to store them upright but they are brutal.  You can buy some special scented bait tubs at bass pro..but whatever i just deal with it.  Capt, the juice leaks everywhere."
1004874,BillM,2017-05-29 17:54:00,17367,I dunno how Berkley hasn't figured out to make these containers not leak.

1004880,Musky Plug,2017-05-29 18:54:00,398,"It smells something wonderful too! lolI have a buddy that bought some leak proof containers from walmart and just transferred the stuff into that because they would just leak all over, and also because I used to complain when it would leak into my boat! lol"
1004882,Cosmos,2017-05-29 19:13:00,588,"Plano has special jar for this type of baits. I am using it for 3 years now, no problem. It's cost around $6 in SAIL if i am not wrong."
1004884,Terry,2017-05-29 19:28:00,14456,the only way to stop them from leaking is to drain jars and throw the whole thing in an air tight garbage  bag and put it out to the road i love the stuff but it always leaks
1004886,porkpie,2017-05-29 19:32:00,2521,This is the product you need. I have one in my boat and throw all the gulp in it.  Hasn't leaked yet!

1004903,bare foot wader,2017-05-29 21:11:00,1354,"another vote for the plano container, it works....I'd suspect any number of kitchen containers would work too, but I prefer the screw top lid vs snap top lids  friggin annoying you have to do that but my confidence in gulp outweighs the con of buying a separate container  http://www.basspro.com/Plano-LiquaBait-Locker-Bottle/product/10211186/"

1004940,hunteronwheels,2017-05-30 02:42:00,112,i use the plano http://www.planomolding.com/fishing/stowaway-utility-boxes/liqua-bait-locker-system  they stack nice and never leak and the bottles come with tongs
1004945,adempsey,2017-05-30 04:32:00,1498,"Throw them in the garbage, stop buying Gulp Alive and just buy regular Gulp !! That's what I did.  I hate that stuff.  I tried teflon tape on my Gulp Alive bottles, kinda worked for a while, but some leaked after time.  Probably would have been a wise idea to redo the tape after the day of use.  I didn't do that."
1004968,colin519,2017-05-30 12:53:00,101,"I use 2 Plano containers. One for new baits, and one for used baits. Much stronger, no leaks, no problem.  These things slay, I've fished them for ages and it's too good a bait to drop it out cuz it's a bit messy. Minnows are too inconsistent to purchase reliably. If you can actually buy 10 healthy 4 inch, thick shiners for the price of a Gulp you let me know in a PM......"
1004970,LittleWorm,2017-05-30 14:17:00,122,"I bought two buckets of the Gulp alive minnows 2 years ago at Sail in Ottawa. Was a great deal, reg was $24.99 each  and I got them for $6.99 each on sale. I just make sure the lid is on tight and have never had a problem with them leaking. They sit in my tackle bag, get thrown around and stepped on and have not leaked once."
1005029,PUMP KNOWS,2017-05-30 21:47:00,937,Thanks for the feedback.  I'll update with what I come up with.  I would prefer to stick with Powerbait but I find good deals on Gulp products that I can't pass up on.
