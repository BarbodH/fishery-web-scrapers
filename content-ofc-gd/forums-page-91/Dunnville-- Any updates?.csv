In spite of the cold front and the north west gusty winds there was a good number of decent sized fish and a couple that might hit the scale at 12-13 lbs. There were other guys fishing but most were above the dam."

I do know a guy that was slamming then 3 weeks back until he took out his prop and put a nice crease in his hull when he hit a deadhead. I went out and it was a mess of wood floating around 3 weeks back, no Cats for us. The water is still high and muddy, just take care."
