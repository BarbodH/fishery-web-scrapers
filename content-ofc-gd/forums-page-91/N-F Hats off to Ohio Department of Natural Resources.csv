1005678,smitty55,2017-06-07 02:26:00,928,Good for them. Even the gals were in on it. Seems strange that they knew exactly how many deer were shot and how many were bucks. Maybe they got one of the culprits to turn.Or maybe the poachers were stupid enough to keep records lol. A two year investigation before laying charges seems like a long time. Were they watching them for that long? I guess these investigations can take a good time to gather enough evidence to make sure of convictions. It will be interesting to get more info after the courts are done.  Cheers
