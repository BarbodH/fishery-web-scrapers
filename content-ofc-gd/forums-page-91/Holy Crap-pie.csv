1005741,fisher,2017-06-07 17:49:00,451,"Thanks for your help posting them right side up.  It was hard for me to correct so I just gave up.  They were 13-14 inches.  It was our annual fishing trip with the guys and we decided to go to this lake this year.  I have to say the fishing was really good.  Plan to go back up there again next year.  We got into pike, walleye and accidental large and small mouth bass.  I think it has to do with the lake being very lightly fished...at least while we were there.  The only thing is that it is a prop and bottom end busting lake.  A couple of boats we saw hit their bottom end during our short stay.  Luckily they were not going fast.  I managed to leave unscathed.  That lake will go from 40 feet to 1 foot in less than 20 feet.  And with the higher water this year, the dangers that were previously visible are now just lying under the water."
