My boats not worth a fortune but I'd like to get insurance on it; as I've invested what I feel is a descent amount into it, and had it broken into and things stolen, last week. I talked to my insurance broker and they said they don't deal with boats so I'm trying to figure out who to call next."

1005453,Rattletrap2,2017-06-05 15:26:00,1652,"I deal with Certas (Which was State Farm, and is owned I believe by Desjardins). My insurance is $269 per year on a new boat."

1005468,Old Ironmaker,2017-06-05 18:39:00,8243,"I have mine simply tied in with my Home Owners policy from a local Mutual Ins. Co. I had many options to choose from. I have full replacement of original price when bought as well as a few grand in electronics and accessories. After looking at the cost of my tackle I need to take some photos for them and bring it in in case of theft or loss of it. I added up the stuff that I take out long lining, oh my oh my it is more than a few toonies. The cost is around $450.00 a year. Includes 1 million in liability in case of an accident on the water. I was surprised when I bought the boat to find that not many boaters I know bother to insure them. Not smart."
1005493,AdamS,2017-06-05 21:49:00,161,Thanks for all the replies gentlemen! Always appreciated. I will be looking into this immediately. Cheers.
