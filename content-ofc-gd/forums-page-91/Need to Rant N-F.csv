It's easy to win the battle and lose the war. If you need to blackmail your employer, as opposed to scheduling a meeting and negotiating your position, you're probably working for the wrong company."
1005322,Big Cliff,2017-06-04 08:51:00,6899,"Well it's been a few days and I have cooled off some. 20 years ago in my younger days I would have been arrested for assault the day they told me they hired someone else but I like to think I am older and wiser. I have updated my resume and have a few interviews to go to in the next week and a half. To answer some questions, I did talk to my manager and regional manager and it was a decision they both made to go with someone else for the full time position and their reasoning was I am already there as a pert timer and it's easier to find a person looking for full time work then a pert time position. Now what really grinds my gears , and I can't help but laugh is that I am training the supervisor and full person they hired, i'm not good enough for the position but i'm good enough to train people for the positions! Both seem like really nice guys and I am holding nothing against them as they had nothing to do with me not getting hired but I do find it funny that I have to train both of them on what tools are what and how to use them  ( as well as out computer system ) . Their tool knowledge seems to really be lacking. Like I said, resume is done up and being sent out, I like my job and am very good at it and really wanted the full time position but it's not to be. I held my temper ( and my tongue ) in check to keep my job to bay the bills and buy more fishing gear!!! Hopefully one of my interviews coming up will pan out. Good for you! When you do leave don't burn any bridges behind you, give proper notice, don't bad mouth the company, keep your head held high. It is amazing how often down the road the past comes back to play a role in your future!  If you are asked why you are leaving simply explain that while you loved your job and the company you wanted full time and they just didn't have that opportunity available for you right now.  Lastly; it sounds like one of your best qualities could be working against you. In your OP you mentioned that you went overboard in stepping up every time they asked. Learn to say NO sometimes, coming home in the middle of a shopping trip because they needed you for a part time position..... how did that work out for you?  Keep us posted, I bet things are just going to get bigger and brighter for you from here on in."
1005326,Rizzo,2017-06-04 12:25:00,4754," Never works? Actually, it works quite well for valuable employees who're in high demand. Not so well for those who aren't as valuable as they think they are.  It's a job, not your wife or family. Tell them how you feel and simply move on if you don't like their response/outcome. Far too many people go to work every day hating their jobs and it should never be that way. Bingo"

It is amazing how often down the road the past comes back to play a role in your future!   This is absolutely true. When I finally left my first job to become a GM elsewhere....guess who came calling about 3 years later? You got it. My first employer (whom according to grimsbylander I blackmailed) asked that I come back to join them in a significant role. Apparently they didn't feel my honesty (needing a full-time job) was blackmail! We chose not to go back as I loved where I was working. However, to this day (23 years later), I still have a great relationship with the folks who were wise enough to give me that full-time job they knew I was looking for."
1005064,LittleWorm,2017-05-31 05:34:00,122,"I need to vent some frustration, has nothing to do with fishing. I work at a local tool rental place, I have been here 8 months ( since the store opened ) and even helped set up the store. I am a part time employee and have 4 years experience in tool rental and I am a certified Dewalt tool technician. I work hard and I am very good at my job. There are only ( sorry, were ) only 5 of us at the store. A supervisor, one full time employee and 3 part time employees. The supervisor, the full time and myself were the original 3 with the other 2 part time workers coming later.  My supervisor , the full time and one of the part time employee's  recently gave there notice. I applied for the full time position that is available, I am already doing the job and my first ( and only ) review was excellent. I am more then qualified for the job ( heck, i'm qualified for the supervisors job as I have managed a multi million dollar store in the past ). Since starting this job I have covered many shifts for other who keep calling in sick, One time I left my dad's birthday dinner because they needed someone to come in and cover a shift. Another time I was in the US with my wife doing shopping and going out for supper and to the casino when I got a call they needed someone so once again I came home early to help them out  I have went above and beyond everything they have asked of me to do and guess what? That's right, they decide to hire someone new with next to no experience for the full time position. I'm so pissed right now because you know why they say they did it,,,,because it's easier to find a full time employee then it is to find someone willing to work part time and they need me to stay flexible and be able to cover shifts.  I'm being punished for being dependable and reliable . We work long hours by ourselves, I work 9 hours but get payed for only 8.5 even thought I don't get an actual meal break. We are not allowed to close the store so we have to eat our lunch at the counter and have stop our ""lunch"" when someone comes in. Ever try to reheat food,,,well after 3 or 4 times of having to reheat it because of being interrupted its as hard as a rock and inedible.  Sorry for the rant, I just needed to blow off some steam and it was either this or or nasty letter to my boss and as much as I would like to quit I need my job."
1005065,Big Cliff,2017-05-31 08:43:00,6899,"I have been in the same sort of position a couple of times in my 55 years of working and I feel your pain. My suggestion is ; follow the lead of your full time supervisor and get the heck out of there, go find a place to work where your dedication and loyalty will be appreciated!"
1005067,Whitespinnerbait,2017-05-31 10:24:00,2038,Unfortunately......welcome to the New Generation where employers don't care about LOYALTY anymore !!!!  Hard workers like yourself are a minority.......Slackers rule.

I agree wit DanD its a small world and you do not want to burn any bridges.  My opinion is that ones career must also be a culture fit as well as an equal opportunity environment.  If its not a fit then search for another opportunity, do your due diligence about the new company and move on when you find a new job.  Don't quit first as looking for a new job while unemployed will be a more difficult experience.  Good luck."
1005076,grimsbylander,2017-05-31 12:57:00,3016,"Whenever you're faced with frustration at work, always remember that whatever you do, do it on your terms. People that react on emotion and quit are not punishing the business, just themselves. All you do is first decide if it's time to leave and if so, do it on your terms. Prepare your resume, list all the potential businesses within your acceptable driving radius and decide on a minimum salary/benefits/perks, that suit you. Again....everything on your terms. Leaving a job for a better job is far more satisfying, and rewarding, than doing it from a place of frustration.  And I agree with Dan, there are businesses that appreciate loyalty.  There may be people that don't but generally, they're the ones that have never spent more than a few years with one company and for good reason. Coincidentally, the company I work for just implemented a cash reward system based on years of service."
1005087,Tom S,2017-05-31 14:27:00,362,"Can I ask if you've talked to your employer about how you feel?  It sounds like you want to move up in the company, ask them if there is that possibility. Let them know that if their difficulty in finding part-time help is why you're being held back that you feel like you are then being taken advantage of. Don't write a nasty letter, don't try to solicit advice from a public forum, sit down and have a face-to-face discussion with the person making that decision. Doing that will also show that you have a good head on your shoulders and can communicate, that you can resolve issues. The answers given in that meeting should be what you base your next steps on."
1005088,Headhunter,2017-05-31 14:41:00,5703,"What Cliff said! Polish the resume and get looking for a better gig. Stay employed and find a different job.

Jsut be sure that the next company you work for offers what you are seeking as you don't want to be seen as a job hopper. RE the resume - don't just talk about your roles and or functions, talk about your accomplishments. things that you did that helped save the company you are working for; time, process and money.

If you are happy and confident in your abilities of your current job, then step up and make your voice heard. Do not be stepped on. If thats what you are worried about, then you are just there to be there. I have been with the same company for 22 years. Starting off at the bottom and kept working my way up. It wasnt for what I knew, but my work ethics. Worked hard and always willing to learn. The company I work for, seen this, and always rewarded me. Never asked for a thing. They would offer one job to the next. I was always taking them up on their offers.  Now heres one thing I will tell you about moving on up. ( And Im not talking about the Jeffersons   ) More hours, more responsibilities.  This took it,s toll on me the past 5 years. Stress and health issues. The company never seen the signs, nor did I, as the plant was running fine. Then one day, it hit and I was not the same person I was. The company did get on board and asked that I keep my position, but needed to step back and give up my work load and hours. They brought new people in to help with this. This was a real hard pill to swallow for me, but it was for the best. I now work a normal 40 hour week, but I still care how things go. Im not a leave it for the next guy kinda guy. Before I was doing 50-60 HPW. My longest stretch with 4 days off was 4 months. That was due to me being concerned, and thinking the plant was mine.  Just something to think about if you really want to be the, go to guy.  Good luck"
1005259,Old Ironmaker,2017-06-03 01:17:00,8243,"There is always a method to get what you feel you deserve. On one hand it isn't advisable to go in with emotion and show your cards as ""I'm looking for another job if you don't value me"", the boss can say ""good luck to you, I wish you the best."" Or hold your cards close to your vest. I don't know what business you are in but even if a small shop or big business this too has back fired. People talk and managers in business even competitors are closer than one may think. I remember a young supervisor that was getting jerked around that passed his resume about the industry and within a week our Divisional Manager was asked by a competitor for his opinion of this employee. He was caught off guard and embarrassed. The competitor was probably slighting our Manager in the not so innocent conversation. The guy was gone in 2 weeks without employment. Not as easily done today but management would have made it hell for him to stay and he would have never advanced until the current group of managers were long retired. On the other hand my 2 biggest moves I made in my 30 years was because I basically quit. Once walked out in the middle of the day and never showed up the next morning. I got a call from Industrial Relations, now referred to as Human Resources and was offered a better position in a completely different field. He asked me what took me so long? It was all a test for seeing the big picture. It was a clerical job in a pool of 25 people doing the same thing each and every day and if you hang in you die or retire there. The next time was 5 years latter and I gave my letter of resignation after being scheduled 24 consecutive night shifts. I was a relief foreman and again I found out it was a test. Hopefully management doesn't do this anymore but I suspect they still do. Is it possible you are being tested? The boss and you are the only 2 of the 5, 3 leaving, that is strange plus they flew in a full timer over you, man that is cold. From the outside with the limited information you have shared here you are not as valuable as you think you are or the manager has plans he isn't sharing. I hope it is the latter. Not all managers are good at it, you may have one that isn't and can't see the trees for the forest. The best of luck to you."
