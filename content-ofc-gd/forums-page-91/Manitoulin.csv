Been going up there for a few years and have had some luck with rainbows, pike, and smallmouth.  Anyone provide some information regarding lake trout and walleye/pickerel fishing in the bay.  I know perch are in the bay but they are small.  I mark weedbeds, points, drop offs, etc where you would think there would be walleyes but no luck.  We do have a small boat with a down rigger.  Will be there end of July.  Any advice would be appreciated.  I catch and release."
