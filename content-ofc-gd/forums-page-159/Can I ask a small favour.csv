932075,tender52,2015-08-31 18:29:00,270,I have a new to me boat and trailer. Trailer is almost fixed and I would like to borrow a  troling motor for this weekend if possible. I just want to make sure she floats good. I do have one but its 3hrs north of here. I will not abuse it. I only want to use it for 2hrs or so. I live in Cambridge so close by pls.  Cheers  Colin
