932619,huzzsaba,2015-09-04 00:52:00,884,Aren't these the same I see swimming around at port credit and bronte?  So what if you catch one? What should you do?  I see the one like in the picture all the time and also something that looks Like carp but more of a silver color I have been noticing lately.
932633,chris.brock,2015-09-04 02:50:00,4053,"Probably common carp you're seeing Huzz.  If I caught one of the new invasive carp species, I'd keep it and call the MNR."
932694,Acountdeleted,2015-09-04 17:15:00,2562,Still not good sadly but at least they aren't the jumpy super Mario carp.
