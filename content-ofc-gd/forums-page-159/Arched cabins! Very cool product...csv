The only thing I can think of right now is that they are in Texas, which will certainly add to the cost for people in the Northern USA / Canada.  Interestingly, the cost of the cabins includes labour to construct them.  But not the travel cost for the crew I would imagine."

I would think even including shipping costs these would be pretty inexpensive ""cottages/cabins""  Would certainly be interesting to find out what the shipping costs would be as they have a distributor in Ohio...

I don't think I will be buying a building where they say it's ""about"" this high. Shipping is charged from Texas not the dealer. With the exchange rate and shipping plus duties I don't think it might be a deal at all. Did anyone get a price? I don't think it's anything you can't build here. Interesting though."

No. I said that some liberty's do apply if you build it yourself with your own hands for  personal use. I thought we were talking about building in the bush not Cottage country.

932710,G.mech,2015-09-04 18:36:00,830,"Ontario does everything they can so you can't build anything out of the ""norm""  Well not really.  They do however want to ensure buildings designed in Texas don't collapse under the weight of the snow we get here.  I found this article which kind of clarifies that all buildings built in Ontario are required to conform to the OBC (whether for private use or rental) but you do not have to apply for a permit in unorganized townships.  It states:   Truth is, nobody is watching and most camps and such buildings in these areas would never meet code in a million years so it's kind of up to you. If you are comfortable sleeping under a roof that is not capable of supporting the snow loads which it may see, knock yourself out.   In all honesty, the way snow loads are calculated and given the shape of these things, they aren't likely going to collapse anyway.  Point is, if you need to apply for a permit, this likely won't be approved in areas of heavier snowfall.  http://www.muskokaregion.com/news-story/3573192-pushing-for-new-building-code-regulations/"
