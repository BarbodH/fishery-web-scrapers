932128,huzzsaba,2015-08-31 23:23:00,884,I will likely head out to the southern tip of our province. Plan is to visit wheatley PP and point pelee. Would like to get some fishing done as well. Looking to get into some walleye if this is possible from shore.  The only shore spot I can tell from Google maps is wheatley Harbor as well as Leamington harbor .  Thanks

I don't think they get many walleye in the harbor, we only saw small perch.  Leamington was alot bigger of a harbor and not sure if they allow fishing from there docks or not.  We got a pile of fish out there but had to get to 50 fow to get them."
