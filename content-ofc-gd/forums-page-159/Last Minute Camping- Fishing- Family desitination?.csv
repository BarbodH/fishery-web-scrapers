Looking for a place with camping (powered as a bonus) a beach for the kids to swim and preferably some smaller water for my small 12 foot boat and some fishing.  Parks Ontario is pretty jammed up but I know there is a ton of knowledge around here to I thought you guys might know some campgrounds where I might find some availability.  Thanks in advance as always."

932227,wask,2015-09-01 19:52:00,174,"Ahhh, good question.  Im in Markham 2-3 hours would be good but for the right situation maybe even a little further.  Would also consider good cottage/ trailer deal too.  Thanks!"

932235,Gerritt,2015-09-01 20:21:00,6129,Wouldn't hurt to try presqu'ile provincial park as well.....( just down the road from me ) huge beaches and a boat launch just outside the park.... 5.00 to launch and park.   I see they have several non reservable sites available....  G
932257,huzzsaba,2015-09-01 21:36:00,884,"Point Farms Provincial Park is one of my favorites. Not too far (2.5 hours),nice beach and the friendliest park I have ever camped at.  We were there 2 weeks ago and the watersof lake huron was nice and warm for swimming. Goderich is right around the corner with all the amenities of a bigger city and they have a boat launch there at the marina.  If you leave home early morning like 7 am or so, you should be able to get into their first come first served site.  17-18-34-35 are good sites and the comfort station there is brand new."
