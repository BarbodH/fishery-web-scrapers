I would like to learn more about this area from first hand experiences-fish species, times of year etc. I fish out of a kayak so I am thinking about launching out of Sunnyside beach and paddling along the inner break wall to the east and west perhaps also into the nearby marina's etc. looking to target pike and bass and perhaps carp-although I have never fished for them, it may be a good place to start....be a good place to watch the airshow too come to think of it! ...Thanks,Skdds"
