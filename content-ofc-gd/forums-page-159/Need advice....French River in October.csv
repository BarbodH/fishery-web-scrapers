931495,bigcreekdad,2015-08-27 12:05:00,546,"Has anyone fished the French in October? I tried several years ago....caught one muskie trolling, but could not locate any bass or walleye. They obviously are no longer in their summer spots. Any advice on how/where (in the water column) to fish for them?"
931496,Old Ironmaker,2015-08-27 12:11:00,8243,Go to You tube and The Canadian Sport Fishing Show. They filmed it on the West Arm out of Maskinonje Lodge the time we were there for my Musky charter. Cold front Bass and they did well. Must be close to the same conditions as the French.
931517,Headhunter,2015-08-27 13:36:00,5703,I would concentrate on areas that have deep water access and weed lines that are still green. Fished the French a few years ago during Thanksgiving weekend and finding still green weeds was difficult. HH
931537,Cast-Away,2015-08-27 16:20:00,790,Which part of the river are you going to?
931605,chris.brock,2015-08-27 21:33:00,4053,"Yeah, what lodge/ section are you going to?  Like HH said, you likely have to go deep, 30 plus FOW, fishing slow."
931633,Mister G,2015-08-27 23:19:00,1429,FAST drop off into deep water near feeding flats. Don't worry about weeds at this time of the year.....vertical jigging with jigging Rapala's tip with minnows on the belly hook.
931639,bigcreekdad,2015-08-28 00:01:00,546,I will be heading to Crane's Lochaven Lodge....Wolesey Bay area.

Look for shoals.  10 ft to 40 ft within 50 yards.  Slow troll a worm harness criss crossing the area or anchor in the spot where it drops to 30+ and use a drop shot."

Slow troll a worm harness criss crossing the area or anchor in the spot where it drops to 30+ and use a drop shot. X2 but I'd anchor slightly up stream of that drop off (SLIGHTLY). Cast your drop shot rig down stream and drag it back up the drop off slowly until you find the fish. Hook your minnows by the head so it looks like they are swimming upstream. The walleye will be there but they will probably be lazy with the colder water moving in.  Late evening shallow faster moving water, anchor upstream and cast down with a floating crank bait (I really like fire tiger pattern for fall fishing) VERY slow retrieve, let the current do the work and don't be afraid to get close to shore and shallow. I usually use this method right from shore if I can find a rock that I can stand on and it sticks out a couple of feet into the current."
