931849,HTHM,2015-08-29 22:04:00,4082,"I was out today and having just switched to mono on my downrigging rods, I am finding that the releases on the cannonballs do not release. I was towing my catches rather than fighting my catches. I had a monster sheepshead on the line at the end of the day, ~10 pounds I estimate, and even that did not trigger the release. One will release as I am lowering the cannonball to depth, and I have to start over with the setup, like 4 times in a row.   Then line further back in the clamp, and no release. What am I doing wrong? "
931850,Sinker,2015-08-29 22:07:00,8692,What kind of releases arw you using?
931851,HTHM,2015-08-29 22:08:00,4082,The spring clamp type. You squeeze and put the line into the jaws.
931865,Freshtrax,2015-08-29 23:17:00,2215,Only put it in a 1/4 of the way
931867,Old Ironmaker,2015-08-29 23:23:00,8243,"Many things will effect the release or non release. There are many of those releases available Albert. Speed, type of line, dimples on the release, depth of line into release etc. Go to Bill's Bait and look at releases and talk to them."
931873,John Bacon,2015-08-29 23:37:00,3277,"Some releases are adjustable.  I have some that have a tab that you can pull it out and tightens the release.  Also, if your release is too light you can loop the line around the release to make it hold better."
931874,Spiel,2015-08-29 23:42:00,9065,"I use the clothes pin type releases Albert (offshore) and replace the mono lead with a minimum of 12's, the longer the better. While they don't always release you will visually see the rod tip bouncing even with a small fish."
931891,HTHM,2015-08-30 01:26:00,4082,Twelve feet long off the ball? Or am I mis-reading your post Chris?
931892,Spiel,2015-08-30 01:32:00,9065,"My bad Albert, 12""s or longer. Mine are about 18""s."
931894,Fang,2015-08-30 02:21:00,1330,"What Spiel said  I've run Offshores since the day they came out. Cut the wire leads off and replace with longer leads. I run about 18"" of weed wacker line in bright green and crimp off with small wire crimps from the hardware store designed for the smallest braided outdoor wire.  For salmon and trout I put all lines - mono or braid right at the back. On Erie I played around with 1/2 to all the way and dint really see any difference.  Make sure you get some bend in the rigger rods so any hit or struggle by a hooked fish makes the rod bounce."
931897,HTHM,2015-08-30 02:37:00,4082,"Thanks very much for the advice, I will be trying it out next time I am on the water."
931915,spincast,2015-08-30 10:55:00,3279,"There are a couple brands on the market like the  Blacks or Chamberlain release http://www.downriggerrelease.com/  the release mechanism is adjustable by turning a knob.  With a weigh scale you can set the tension for the type of fish you are targeting - say 4 lbs for walley, 8lbs for kings.  You can also combine this with different weight rubber bands to work with your target species http://www.michigansportsman.com/Tips_n_Trix/rubber_band_releases.htm  ideally, enough resistance to load up the rod into an ""n"" shape, you will see a shaker swimming, (or one of those come-along walleyes) and a real fish will pop it every time."
931931,Gallie,2015-08-30 15:15:00,1215,"One thing i agree with for sure is getting a good bend in the rod, i crank the rod till im all but certain its going to pop out by itself. I can tell if a 10"" shaker is on instantly. I use the scotty rigger clips on the strong setting and bury the line in the clip every time as well."
932048,Fish Farmer,2015-08-31 14:49:00,2234,"Albert I've been using these for years. Knew a few Charter guys and this is all they use now, cheaper and they work great. I have about 30 around now I keep for spares. Bought a bunch from a table at the Ancaster Swap meet. You used to get them in the local tackle shops for about $2.00 No need to spend big money, I still have a few Off-Shore I use, but these work as good. Use them Salmon and Walleye fishin. They came with a curtain ring I through away and made my own hook up swivel with split ring and big snap. Just watch how far back you put your line. Load your rod a little lighter in you rod holder, you could be putting too much load on your releases.   "
932096,HTHM,2015-08-31 20:17:00,4082,Thanks Dave!
932098,Mister G,2015-08-31 20:37:00,1429,With the above releases just make sure you twist the line 4-6 times and put the twisted line in the release or it may slide and not release.
932099,Old Ironmaker,2015-08-31 20:38:00,8243,Albert ask Richard M. to show you how he ties the rubber bands on to use as a release next time you are there.
932124,fishindevil,2015-08-31 22:35:00,6254,Blacks releases are great been using them for many many years !!! Lots of adjustment it pays to have great releases as they are NOT all the same and yes offshore ones work great too and it's good to change the pads sometimes too there is so eh tricks to help depending on line type
