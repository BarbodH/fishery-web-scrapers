931846,leaf4,2015-08-29 21:44:00,2466,"Lol well done, that is some serious skill"
931847,HTHM,2015-08-29 22:00:00,4082,"Lol well done, that is some serious skill I would say that is some serious video editing. It did not show him actually hitting the marks. However it does bring a great point across."
931890,mike rousseau,2015-08-30 01:01:00,4661,That's how I feel most days compared to the other people at the launch...  You know... With a smaller belly if course...
931975,misfish,2015-08-30 20:25:00,29133,I should do one  mooring the toon. LMAO

932101,Mister G,2015-08-31 20:50:00,1429,Not fun to watch........I really like the idiots that bang into everything while the wife and I are at a boat launch killing some time.
932113,mukluk,2015-08-31 21:24:00,196,Always amusing to watch the rented pontoon boats come into the locks at Fenelon Falls when the operator has had a 10 minute crash course on how to operate everything associated with boat.  Kind of makes the owners of those mahogany polished yachts a little nervous when pontoon boat comes into the lock sideways with the wind pushing them.
932164,Dutch,2015-09-01 03:59:00,831,Love the fist pump at the end.....lol.
932302,Meegs,2015-09-02 00:52:00,249,Lmao.... awsome!!
932363,Can_38,2015-09-02 13:36:00,152,"Awesome, and can relate as I watch some folks at the trailer park who constantly come in hot."
932372,Old Ironmaker,2015-09-02 16:01:00,8243,So that's how you dock a boat!  Actually those lake freighters we used to dock at the plant are amazing when they dock. They can put those Iron Islands on a dime.
