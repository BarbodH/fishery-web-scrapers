931840,misfish,2015-08-29 21:07:00,29133,"Do you guys find the bass (smallies ) in this area, long and lean? Compared to the ones I get on couch and simcoe, they are no where near the weight for their lenght. Like the ones this morning were 20""- 23"" but I would put them at most,3.5- 5 lbs. Thats pushing it. Are all the lakes in that area producing the same, or do you get those foot balls like simcoe? I have to say though, they fight better then a Simcoe smallie. Guess when your fat, your lazy.LOL  Just curious.  Thanks  "
931852,Sinker,2015-08-29 22:09:00,8692,"Yep, kawartha fish dont have the feed like simcoe does. Muskies are the same.  S."
931863,KraTToR,2015-08-29 23:05:00,506,"I find the big smallies at long point don't put up much of a fight either.. big fat and happy.... oh, and probably old as well.  Give me a 16 incher over a 20 any day... except for the photo op!  "
931868,esoxansteel,2015-08-29 23:24:00,1307,"On Rice a 20 inch smallie is easily pushing 4 or better, and 21inch is pushing 5 and a 22 or over is easily 6 or better, and those weights are summer fish, gobies definitely helping in that respect, big smallies are almost square from the throat back. And almost always smallies are needing to win a tournament on Rice now a days, which wasn't always the case pre Zebra Mussels. Ive caught smallies in other K Lakes but were slightly less weight then the numbers and lengths in Rice"
931944,ecmilley,2015-08-30 16:50:00,2163,Was hitting lots of fat smallies on sturgeon ttoday gorgeing on crays
931946,misfish,2015-08-30 16:57:00,29133,This was an inland lake. No connection to the lakes that are connected together.  Should of mentioned that.
931950,GBW,2015-08-30 17:19:00,8460,I find SMB to be long and slim out here and few and far between are shaped like a football. But they fight like a tank!
931963,grimsbylander,2015-08-30 19:02:00,3016,"The smallies on the Upper Niagara feed like kings and because they live their lives in current, they're amazing strong. I've had 3lb fish that I was sure were huge."
931964,ONbuckhunter,2015-08-30 19:05:00,39,Then you answered your on question.  Comparing a Simcoe smallie to an inland lake smallie is like comparing apples to oranges.
931973,misfish,2015-08-30 20:09:00,29133,"Well I have to say, I was corrected this morning by a 19 "" simcoe smallie. Guess he heard about my report.LOL  They are starting to feed I guess."
932010,sofabed,2015-08-31 02:14:00,119,"I weight a 19"" SM on Friday 3.9. This was on Balsam lake."
932031,Gregoire,2015-08-31 10:58:00,1397,"The forage base or at least density seems to be changing. The musky are getting much fatter. Noticed this especially on Scugog, where they used to be snakes. Might be due to the dwindling walleye population."
