Not much for action, a decent chunky lil bass and a few sauger landed in about two hours. Pretty boring but hey, nothing wrong with that?  Caught the bass quick, first few casts. Short fish, maybe 17"" but thick as my bloated head!    So you gotta problem with this guy owning a handgun? Meet me here??? byob    Scenery was beautiful, very relaxing.     Odd thing, we've had no mayfly hatch this year then BOOM! Everywhere!!!! Latest hatch I remember... ( pic doesnt do it justice, they are thick with juvies)     Facebook tells me its ""yay you have a dog day"" or something like that? So here is ivy, at my feet as usual waiting for bed.    Miigwich!  Rick"

931478,manitoubass2,2015-08-27 03:02:00,11391,Exactly. Never seen it before.  And their just juvies so its only gonna get worse
931484,OhioFisherman,2015-08-27 05:29:00,6623,"Nice pics by the way, them bugs won't have a chance to grow, don't you usually get snow in the next couple of weeks? LOL"
931490,BillM,2015-08-27 09:52:00,17367,"I've seen late hatches of giant brown drakes up on Nipigon in August, it can be quite the sight!"
931491,Old Ironmaker,2015-08-27 10:13:00,8243,"I'm so glad the kids look like their Mom. I have to tell you that puppy Ivy is absolutely gorgeous, I don't think I've seen him or her before. as for you getting a gun up there you are going to need more than 1 when the boys come a knockin' at your door looking for one of the girls. It won't be long Rick, probably already started.  Football season is a few weeks away, PM me with your predictions for the season. Watch out for the Bills, that is if they get someone to hit the broad side of a barn with a football. Maybe start an NFL thread this year? Has to be more than 2 NFL followers here."
931527,manitoubass2,2015-08-27 15:25:00,11391,"Dood, my daughter just registered for highschool this morning, not looking forward to that at all.
