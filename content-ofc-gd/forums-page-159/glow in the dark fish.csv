931521,jimmer,2015-08-27 14:36:00,2730,"Some one else recently posted about catching a pike with similar features. Not sure what site it was on, but more local to Ontario."
932207,bobowski,2015-09-01 17:07:00,360,I caught this Pike on the weekend out of Georgian Bay. It had a neon tongue and a little around the mouth.  
932228,AKRISONER,2015-09-01 19:57:00,5558,"I caught a pike this weekend with similar colouration, not as neon, but definitely blue approaching light green.  Something is definitely up...? is this just a normal occurance, or is there something causing this?"
932245,dave524,2015-09-01 20:48:00,4508,"Male Bowfin have the exact same coloration during spawning, caught them in the channels and marsh at Long Point like that. Totally unrelated I'm sure , just saying."
