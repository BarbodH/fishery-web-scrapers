931843,Rod Caster,2015-08-29 21:20:00,5784,looks like a pumpkin.  Awesome.  I have a pile of half pound tomatoes...I just need them to rippen
931896,bigugli,2015-08-30 02:36:00,6138,"  When making a toasted tomato sandwich, you slice the mater in 1/2 and put the toast in the middle."
931898,bigugli,2015-08-30 02:39:00,6138,That is a fine looking tomato. We have a lot of beefsteak tomatoes in the 1 1/2 to 1 3/4lb size that we have been harvesting over the past week. We even have a donut that would put Timmies to shame.
931925,ketchenany,2015-08-30 14:41:00,3229,"Bruce for the size there were not a  lot of seeds probably around 60 if that. It was all pulp. I have another coming at 1.5 at the most. I will dry the seeds.  Yeasterday we Jarred 15 bushels, close to 300 jars."
932007,bigugli,2015-08-31 01:57:00,6138,"  Often you will not get that many seeds from the monster tomatoes. How big was the root core?  I remember the days of bottling sugo back in the day. We'd pick 100 bushels,  as a group, on the Saturday. Then Sunday was spent blanching, grinding and bottling. By 4 in the afternoon, all was done, and the men were more than a little ubriaco."
932030,ketchenany,2015-08-31 10:14:00,3229,I planted the seeds but it was cold in the garage and  the plants I did get wern't very big my the end of May.  yes there tends ro be a little bit of drinking when tomato day comes around!
