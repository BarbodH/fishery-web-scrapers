931979,Old Ironmaker,2015-08-30 21:04:00,8243,"In my opinion for the average fisherman there is no reason to spend more than 50 beans for a rod. I have hundreds of $$'s in rods but none of my rods other than the 8' downrigger and trolling rods are worth more than 50 bucks. Maybe a few but who's counting?  Every time Ticha asks how much for that one? I reply the same you paid for the last designer purse you bought, $19.99."
932173,dhickey,2015-09-01 05:32:00,1038,Screw the Ugly stick it's a piece of crap. If you have decent rod than it should be able to talk to you regardless . I have a 7ft  comprey cut down to 5/6  and it's my go to trolling/throwing rod for big game. Mind you the reals have had some work outs.  Don
932198,dave524,2015-09-01 14:36:00,4508,"Sensitivity is confusing , people watching a rod tip for bites like to see movement if a gnat lands on the line on the other hand if you are trying to feel a bite with the hand holding the rod while retrieving , a soft flexible tip is the last thing you want as any movement of the tip dampens the transmission of a bite to the hand, stiffer  is best here. One definition of sensitivity is at odds with the other."

One definition of sensitivity is at odds with the other.  Bingo! A hardened steel rod with wire would transmit vibrations better than most rods, however no one would care to fish it all day. The loss of a few inches of the tip can still be an effective tool, just in a different application (possibly) than before it broke and sometimes better in the desired application."
932264,misfish,2015-09-01 22:07:00,29133,"I always have a finger on the line. Any touch of the bait, you will feel it.  A rod held straight out, line out or down, you will feel the lightest of touch."
932278,huzzsaba,2015-09-01 22:55:00,884,I posted this in my other thread.  I caught this nice smallie on the broken rod.  4 pounder put up a good rod bending drag peeling fight.  I have decided to buy a Shimano FX4000 rod reel combo from Canadian Tire as the combo is cheap and reviews are great.  Good enough for salmon and steelhead fishing.  I will probably put some 15 or 20lb Maxima Ultragreen line on so I dont have to deal with attaching leaders on all the time.  
931534,huzzsaba,2015-08-27 16:12:00,884,"So the tip of my fishing rod broke and not knowing there was a fix for it, I cut it to the next eyelet.  total amount of rod lenght lost if 4 inches so what was 6'6 foot rod is now 6'2.  I would like to contrinue fishing with it as I don't think the additional 4 inches will make too much difference but need your advice.  The rod is a shimano rod with a shimano Zuraca 2500 reel which I really like the feel of and the quality of the reel is great. Surprisingly it has great reviews considering I got it for free with the points on my credit card  .  If I were to switch out the rod and keep the reel, should I go with a Shimano or go with a Ugly stick?  I don't want to spend too much and I am pretty comfortable with the 6'6 rod since I like to cast and retrieve most of the time.  Thanks"
931536,Cast-Away,2015-08-27 16:18:00,790,You can send it in to Shimano to repair or replace for a nominal fee.
931542,huzzsaba,2015-08-27 16:33:00,884,Thanks for the suggestion.  I will look into that.
931617,adam lancia,2015-08-27 22:43:00,234,You could always look in the classified and on Kijiji for a used rod that matches your old one.
931618,FloatnFly,2015-08-27 22:48:00,1640,"send in the tip, they'll match it up and send you a new top piece"
931627,Mister G,2015-08-27 23:13:00,1429,"About 2 week ago I had 2 rods that ""I"" broke (long story) and took the tip sections back to Cabela's as they both were Cabela's rods. I found the fishing dept manager and ask where the repair kits were.....he looked at the rod tips and ask if they were Cabela's rod.......of course I said yes.......he then said you can either purchase rod repair kits or we will replace the rods for free if you have the other sections of the rods. Well, I had them in the car and Bada Boom Bada Bing........ Cabela's replace two rods.....one was over 25 years old ($79.99) and the other was about 5 years old ($49.99).  I walk out....no dance out of there one happy happy happy man ! ! !  CABELA'S is on GREAT store when it comes to customer service . . . ."
931687,adam lancia,2015-08-28 14:00:00,234,"send in the tip, they'll match it up and send you a new top piece  This would definitely be a good option if it's a 2 piece rod."
931688,Lape0019,2015-08-28 14:11:00,647,"I personally would just buy another rod or have it replaced under warranty but this does not sound like a manufacturers defect. I do not know if this is a one or two piece rod but I use all 1 piece rods. The tip of your rod is where a lot of the action that the blank makes. It is also what creates the presentation you are looking for. If 4"" is now missing from the rod, the way it has behaved in the past is now all but gone. With that much of the tip gone, your rod is also going to load up faster. this would drive me nuts so I would just go buy another one rather than trying to fix it."
931697,sneak_e_pete,2015-08-28 15:10:00,540,Its not the length that matters...its how you use it
931704,Bernie,2015-08-28 15:57:00,3190,Broke the tip off of a Shimano in a ceiling fan. Wasn't the same after as it lost sensitivity.
931714,porkpie,2015-08-28 17:20:00,2521,"St. croix sells boxes of warranty return rods.  I buy busted rods from my local tackle shop with anywhere from 2-6 inches missing from them all the time.  I have some $350 rods that I payed $15 for and they work just fine with a new tip guide.  I wouldn't worry about it, you can fish it as is.  Ugly sticks are pretty durable all around rods, and can be had for $35 on sale at Canadian tire often enough, if you want to buy new."
931716,bow slayer,2015-08-28 17:46:00,1074,"check your local tsc store,mine has a couple ulgy sticks left going for 25 bucks."
931719,keswickman,2015-08-28 18:03:00,7,I broke my rod tip a couple weeks ago. Went to Lebaron to buy rod tip repair kit. The kit had size in metric and I had measured in inches. Asked the clerk if he could convert he said no and went behind counter and brought out plastic bin full of tips and guides and said try one. I had the old broken tip with me and found one which fit the rod end. The asked how much he said 2 bucks. Went cashier and she was waiting for customer to come back with a a replacement item clerk saw me waiting came over and asked if I had a tooney. Gave him one and he said ok thanks and I left. Great service and price. Went home mixed some 5 minute expoy and fixed rod.
931720,manitoubass2,2015-08-28 18:21:00,11391,"Get a new rod. 4"" just made your rod into a walleye jigging rod with no sensitivity and way tooo stiff."
931727,Mister G,2015-08-28 18:59:00,1429,"Broke the tip off of a Shimano in a ceiling fan. Wasn't the same after as it lost sensitivity. Oh my, what were you fishing for ? ? ?  LOL...."
931807,huzzsaba,2015-08-29 15:33:00,884,Thanks for all the replies.  I tried fishing with it yesterday and did not notice any difference using it. I will be getting a another rod anyways and will keep the broken one (shorter one lol) as spare or for my daughter or wife to use.
931811,Parnelly,2015-08-29 17:26:00,108,"Sail stores sell a kit with 3 different sized tips, and some contact cement. Have repaired several rods this way and havent had an issue with any of the tips coming off. Bout 4 dollars for the kit."
931815,Old Ironmaker,2015-08-29 19:03:00,8243,Repair the tip. Don't use it broken. And get yourself another of your choice. Can't beat a Ugly Stick for all around fishing. You do not need to spend big money for a fairly good rod.
931818,manitoubass2,2015-08-29 19:10:00,11391,"Those repair kits are good but id say just keep it as a backup.  4"" off a rod makes a HUGE difference.  Funny you mention ugly stiks Oi, i still have like 4 from when i was a kid lol."
931909,adolson,2015-08-30 05:36:00,783,"Seems pointless to suggest buying a new tip when the OP said he cut it off at the next eyelet...  I would also suggest staying far away from an Ugly Stik, unless you really don't care about feeling light or medium hits. I used to be a big Ugly Stik fan, but it was out of sheer ignorance. Sure, they're durable. But so is a steel pole. Even my cheapest Shimanos feel ten times better than any Ugly Stik I've used."
931910,manitoubass2,2015-08-30 05:58:00,11391,Thats true.
931923,Smokercrafty,2015-08-30 13:28:00,227,"I'd have to agree about those ugly sticks. Sure, they're great for the 2-5 time a year user who targets EVERYTHING in one outing, but, I'd be aiming towards a new rod myself, especially with that 4"" loss. Kijjjiji could be your best friend, or better yet, visit the classifieds here! Always a deal to be found.    Good luck."
931930,Old Ironmaker,2015-08-30 15:08:00,8243,"The OP said he used rhe rod with a broken tip and found no difference, I figured an Ugly Stick has to be better than that."
931948,Gallie,2015-08-30 17:01:00,1215,"I have to disagree with the lack of sensitivity with an ugly stick, ive used anything from a medium light to an extra heavy and have had no issue detecting small hits for anything ive fished for. I had a 8'6"" med heavy that i used for carping and i could see when they sucked the bait up no problem. My wife has a 7' medium action that i have used to jig for pics and could feel the tiniest perch nibble. I think the line and the setup and the rod action all play a big role with sensitivity but you simply cannot beat an ugly stick for the price."
931969,porkpie,2015-08-30 19:47:00,2521,"Ugly sticks are fantastic trolling rods, in have 2 that see use almost every outing.  I occasionally pull crawler harnesses with rod in hand and a light bell sinker with an ugly stick as well, and I can even detect perch nibbles no problem.  I don't think I'd call them lacking in sensitivity.  Sure I have high end rods that can feel a mouse fart, but an ugly stick for $35 is pretty decent value in my books."
