932212,msp,2015-09-01 18:55:00,1336,"Been on the forum for a while now. Typically I don't post much information but I try to contribute when I can.Here are a few pics from recent years to celebrate my 1000th postThey say a picture says a thousand words. So here are a few thousand words in picturesPike- Because the pike season in southern and central Ontario is so long, I spend most of my time chasing these guys. I love the visual aspect of big pikechasing and engulfing lures. Relatively easy to catch, but sometimes very finicky.Bass- What can I say, I love bass. Especially largemouth. I do enjoy targeting smallmouth a couple times of year as well.Skiis and Eyes- I really should target both species more often. Once or twice a year for each is usually enough to get my fix or a quick tasty treat.Trout- Most of my trout days happened long before digital cameras. Once I purchased a boat, I started to lose interest in trout. Here are a few pics from recentyears."
