Ontario lakes are an important bellwether for this as they are home to both the northern or southern limits of many freshwater fish species. As the climate changes, these limits shift, making Ontario fish particularly vulnerable. I will discuss how the northward march of the feisty smallmouth bass puts angler-favourites, trout and walleye, at long-term risk in Ontario. Sapna Sharma researches the impact of stressors, such as climate change, invasive species and habitat degradation to refine overall environmental predictions. Sapna’s lab is committed to outreach, producing educational resources for younger learners.
