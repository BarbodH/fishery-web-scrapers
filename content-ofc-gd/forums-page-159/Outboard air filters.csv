931664,captpierre,2015-08-28 03:01:00,2521,Just wondering. All my other engines have air filters Why don't outboards?
931665,Smokercrafty,2015-08-28 03:08:00,227,"Water is usually a dust free environment .......  Outboards will sometimes have an air box in front of the carb though. Acts more like a resonator, than a filter medium. I have two identical outboards, one with, the other, without."
931673,dhickey,2015-08-28 04:21:00,1038,Good question. I would think that the cowling around the engine is for the most part a sealed unit and it pulls air through ports on the back side closer to the prop shaft thus pulling clean damp air into the carbs. That would explain why marine oil is different than other types of engine oils.
931674,irishfield,2015-08-28 04:49:00,26272,Mine does... but really if you're boating in a dust storm you're on the wrong lake!
931775,Mister G,2015-08-29 00:43:00,1429,Lots of bugs that a outboard can suck in.......good question and something to think about.....are there any marine mechanics on this board ? ? ?
931777,Sinker,2015-08-29 01:03:00,8692,Mine has one.  S.

931786,2 tone z71,2015-08-29 03:57:00,1311,Is your cowl not sealed and watertight ...where are the bugs gonna come from ?
931788,glen,2015-08-29 04:44:00,2641,I cover mine on dusty roads.  Bugs won't hurt.  That's just lube.
931789,grimsbylander,2015-08-29 05:08:00,3016,I have a cover on mine 100% of the time when trailering.
931790,John Bacon,2015-08-29 07:27:00,3277,Is your cowl not sealed and watertight ...where are the bugs gonna come from ?  The engine wouldn't work if it was.
