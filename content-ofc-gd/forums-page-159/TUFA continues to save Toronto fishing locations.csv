TUFA (Toronto Urban Fishing Ambassadors) was successful in having the signs quickly removed.  TUFA was formed when city council banned shore fishing in Toronto harbour back in 2012.  We have shore fishing opportunities in Toronto in a large part due to the efforts of the TUFA group; especially one of the founders in particular David Clark.   https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=610558839086419&set=gm.1051864634837746&type=1

Shore angling spots are tougher and tougher to come by, and urban fishing locations seem to be going the way of the dodo.  Nasty to just post no fishing signs with absolutely no authority!  So good work by TUFA."

It's the same reason you see ""No Dogs"" signs in a lot of public parks because people couldn't be bothered to not leave piles of dog dirt everywhere."
932196,John Bacon,2015-09-01 14:26:00,3277,"Yes, unfortunately a lot of fishermen are pigs.  TUFA also organizes shore cleanups.  Hopefull that will help."
