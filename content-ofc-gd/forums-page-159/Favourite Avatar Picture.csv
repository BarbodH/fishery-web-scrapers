931545,LostAnotherOne,2015-08-27 17:00:00,956,"Not talking about the movie even thou that blue chic is pretty hot.  I like them tough and rough haha.  Anyways guys just for fun what profile pic on this forum you think is your favourite?  Myself, I have always liked DRIFTER_16 pic.  Nice laker with the blue water and sky in the background.  Probably BillM is a close second.  Just a nice steelhead and rod."
931546,crappieperchhunter,2015-08-27 17:03:00,2582,"The one I and many others have, is the clear favourite. It's the only duplicate one I see on here"

931686,highdrifter,2015-08-28 13:43:00,2534,"I always thought Fidel's is pretty cool.  Thanks Chris!  bit of a eureka moment...  Predator is high up there on the list of faves but couldn't find a decent still from the movie..  Think Total Recall when Arnie goes off the cliff and his helmet shatters and he starts breathing in the martian air!  Fidel does seem like a pretty laid back dude, and he makes a helluva flouro leader too!  Aaww chucks..  havn't tied them in a while..  they still need some tweakin.  Once I'm confident that they can take real abuse I'll be spinning some up again.  cheers!!    Fidel ROCKS  LOL you my boy B!!"

931702,Acountdeleted,2015-08-28 15:56:00,2562,X2 for Joey Tiers. Makes me laugh all the time.  Jacques is pretty good too. An avatar of an avatar.
