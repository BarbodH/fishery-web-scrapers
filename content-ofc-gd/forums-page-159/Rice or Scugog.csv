931813,KraTToR,2015-08-29 18:06:00,506,Going east of the GTA next week in search of largemount and muskie.  What is your recommendation?  Scugog or Rice?  TIA!
931887,ccmtcanada,2015-08-30 00:49:00,7971,Personally I'd do Scugog for Muskie and bass.  If you said walleye and bass I'd do Rice.  Just my two cents....or I guess a nickel since pennies are gone....
931919,Garnet,2015-08-30 12:20:00,2056,Between the 2 I would pick the best restaurant. Bewdley Pizza or the Hyland.  As for fishing the fish different with same results.
931936,Fisherpete,2015-08-30 15:54:00,1814,Scugog.
931965,ONbuckhunter,2015-08-30 19:07:00,39,Rice by a landslide.  Lotsa smallies and buckets.
931971,ccmtcanada,2015-08-30 20:06:00,7971,Agreed....but he said he wants both Muskie and bass.   That's why I said Scugog.
931977,misfish,2015-08-30 20:43:00,29133, That place is still going?  Never fished the bog. Rice for buckets gets my vote.
931988,KraTToR,2015-08-30 22:20:00,506,"I'm way down in my quota for buckets this year, got lots of smallies...  Maybe Rice in the morning and Scugog in the afternoon.. its on the way home..  Thanks everyone!"
931989,Sinker,2015-08-30 22:29:00,8692,"Yep, best pizza around here. They have another franchise in millbrook now too.  I dont fish bass at all, but the musky part I would pick scugog. If you said eyes it would be rice by a landslide!!  S."
932011,spyder3g,2015-08-31 02:17:00,50,"Good luck! But I think without exact locations (GSP coordinates) the success will be minimal, especially now on Rice. Junk buckets are everywhere on the Rice or Scugog, but not pickerels."

932107,Sinker,2015-08-31 21:14:00,8692,Your doing something wrong. That is all.  S.
932214,Stoty,2015-09-01 19:05:00,2910,"Yup, you're def doing something wrong cause Rice is one of the best producing lakes in Canada and the action is just starting to heat up!"
932215,Stoty,2015-09-01 19:05:00,2910,I would however love to fish with GSP!
932225,Big Cliff,2015-09-01 19:49:00,6899,"Rice by a long shot, if the fish aren't biting you can always harvest enough wild rice to pay for your trip!"
932273,misfish,2015-09-01 22:39:00,29133,I would however love to fish with GSP!  Me as well Jamie. Nice call.
932510,Big Cliff,2015-09-03 17:29:00,6899,"I would however love to fish with GSP! Ya, those GSP's can find anything (wounded ducks, geese, fish, upland game birds.....). Sure miss hunting and fishing with my Andy!"
932546,davew3,2015-09-03 20:16:00,430,"Launch at Wildwood cottages on the Ontonabee river just up from Rice Lake.   Bass, wallyeye and muskie."
