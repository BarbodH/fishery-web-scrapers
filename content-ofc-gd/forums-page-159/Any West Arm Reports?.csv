931794,bigcreekdad,2015-08-29 13:36:00,546,Heading up there to Memquisit Lodge in a couple weeks. Have never fished the West Arm.  Anyone been up there this year with anything of note to report?

We fish out in the east bay a lot and the weeds were not well developed.  Heading up,to,the French for a couple weeks - leaving this Thursday night"

Nice cabins and Frank & Charlene are as good as they come and will go out of their way to make your stay a very enjoyable one.  Cabbage weeds have grown alot since we were up that way in June and although they aren't as thick as usual, their still in good shape. Water levels are down  from normal so be very careful where you go if your not familiar with the area cause those rocks will jump out and grab ya. Franks got some decent maps to give you an idea of the safer routes to travel.  This is the 1st year in quite awhile I didn't come across any big muskies up there, infact nothing over 45"" so no pictures were taken and no fishing report was made.  Enjoy your trip."
