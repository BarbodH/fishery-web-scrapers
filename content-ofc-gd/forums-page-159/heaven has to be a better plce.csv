932248,Old Ironmaker,2015-09-01 20:59:00,8243,"Life can be a  pain, can't use the B word here. Visit your local Children's hospital and then post back. I'm having a great day when I get vertical in the AM, and many others here. If you have your health you have it all. It's good to vent though. Vent away."

932287,irishfield,2015-09-01 23:58:00,26272,"John, you and I know it's not a better place for us at this point in time. Our girls maybe. Trudge forward, head high and it will all work out in the end.  As a good friend kept telling me ""it's all a test"". There are no study notes!"
932296,FloatnFly,2015-09-02 00:19:00,1640,"you know, i used to take everything to heart, and anything that happened to me was in some way an attack on on me, then I watched a movie called Van Wilder, and one quote has stuck with me, and I try to live by it, it's ""Don't take life too seriously, no one gets out alive""  for every up, theres a down, for every down, theres an up. when you fall, land gracefully and build yourself back up, just don't look back"

932390,grimsbylander,2015-09-02 18:42:00,3016,"You and Wayne are in a category that nobody should ever experience. Your ability to endure and succeed in spite of it makes you both stronger men than me. You will be rewarded.  I'm with Gerritt, if things get ugly, shoot me a message. Dave"
932407,Old Ironmaker,2015-09-02 20:34:00,8243,No Mom or Dad should ever have to go what you two did. There has to be a better day and place somewhere down the line. Just because 2 people don't agree with one another or on their points of view has nothing to do with respect.
932409,mr blizzard,2015-09-02 20:45:00,1589,Grimsbylander thx pm you

932428,2 tone z71,2015-09-02 22:44:00,1311,"That's a dark place to be ...I've been in over my head several times ...had it all ..had nothing ..it's a process state of mind is important it's not the weight of the world even thou it feels like it ...think things thru ,think clearly..make wise choices it all comes together"
