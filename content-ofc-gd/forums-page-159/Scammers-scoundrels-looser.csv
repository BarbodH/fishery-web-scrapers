932161,dhickey,2015-09-01 03:52:00,1038,This is a warning to all looking to have renovations on their homes or properties. I have had the displeasure of running into this person. He goes by the name of Mike on the internet but as far as I can find his real name is Lee?  I live and work in this region and have never met him before. He promotes himself as a flooring/finishing contractor/general contractor.  HE IS NOT!! His work is sub standard to say the least.  Lee contacted me in order to help him out for 2 days for a set price . I made the mistake of helping him out on a reno for 2 days outside of Shelburn he now owes me 1000$ and he is past due with no response from him for ten days.  The owner of the house has now taken me on to fix a 4 page deficiency list as well as to finish Lee's contract obligations.  I have put out the word on him and have found info on him . NONE of it is good.  3 Job sites incomplete . He takes a deposit gets the customer to pay for equipment and works for a day or two and gone . I have also found out that he does not pay the labourers as well.  This guy is in need of a lesson in the back field!!!!  Don.
932183,Gerritt,2015-09-01 12:16:00,6129,Crap like that burns my ass... Give good contractors a bad name.... How you find him Don
932188,lookinforwalleye,2015-09-01 13:12:00,4399,Is there a company name
932343,dhickey,2015-09-02 05:17:00,1038,Is there a company name  No company name seems to come up. He runs on cash deals preying on the middle class looking for a low price. His name is Lee I cant seem to get a last name yet.  Crap like that burns my ass... Give good contractors a bad name.... How you find him Don  Found him through Kijiji I know what you are thinking but I have used it on a few occasions  and never had a problem this time I may have let my guard down.  On the bright side after putting the hunt on him I got a call today letting me know where he was plus more .  I payed him a visit and filled him in.  It's still a tight small community up here.  Let him know that he just tried to screw the wrong guy and that I had found out where his sites are/who his customers are as well as other sub trades.  So he ran the same crap in Brampton and probably thinks he is hiding in Mullmer /renting  Said he would come up with half of what he owes me on Friday and the other 5 next week.????
932362,Gerritt,2015-09-02 13:35:00,6129,Did you get a plate number from his vehicle? Easy enough to find an address from the plate.....   G

932412,Old Ironmaker,2015-09-02 20:52:00,8243,"There isn't enough time to tell all the stories of the scammers I have come across in this type of business. The construction business in this Province is too lax. A guy wants money all he has to do is throw a skill Saw in the back of a truck, stick a pencil behind his ear and stick a Blue Tooth behind the other ear and he's a ""contractor"" in Ontario.  One the worse was a guy that couldn't read a tape or calculate square footage and I walk into Homeless Despot and he's giving a seminar one Saturday AM.  I wish you the best of luck with this slime bag. A rock can't bleed."

932445,2 tone z71,2015-09-03 01:02:00,1311,Unfortunately in the construction industry...there is more bad then good ..it's harder for the honest fella trying to make a name or some money ..everyone including this last deadbeat undercuts and takes consumer trust away
932453,Old Ironmaker,2015-09-03 04:54:00,8243,"Contractors today have wrongly been lumped in with the old  "" used car salesman"" warning because of these scammer slime bags. I know some great used car salesmen too that don't deserve the stigma as well. Is it contrary to policy here to name names? I wouldn't have a problem naming names Saltydog. The truth is the truth, bury the goof, not in a hole."
