I fished all of 40 minutes before the heavens opened up, but the bite was constant. 2nd cast   As the rain hit this piggy inhaled the worm.  There was also a generous mix of dink bass, rockies and sunfish to keep me very busy for that short time. I had to call it quits before I soaked the camera. Left the waterproof bag in my jacket at home."
