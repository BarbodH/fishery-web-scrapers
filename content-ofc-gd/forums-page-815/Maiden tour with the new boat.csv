363501,misfish,2009-07-17 22:12:00,29133,"Both Betty and I got off work earlly.The sun was shining,but could see some dark clouds heading.Figured we go for a quick tour of the bay. Launch went well, so so. Turn blower on,and start.Aw wait a minute,dosent sound right.Crapola,didnt lower the out drive.No prob.Turn off lower,lower the drive,turn on blower again,start.Alls good. Now were off.Head right to my fav smallie area to wet a line for awhile.No fish.Must be the big boat.LOL   It was not a fishing day for me,it was a tour for Betty and her boat.     The wind was blowing 20k from the south,so I figured why not head and see how she does,as I knew there would be a good chop in the main lake.And there was.2.5 to 3 foot waves. I was impressed how she handled.Betty on the other hand,her eyes were on the hell hold on handle.LOL     We could see the storm was moving into the Barrie area fast so we head for port.Man did it come down.We were told that some of the stitching leaked and it did,but no worries,have a new top being made in the next couple of weeks.  Heres the next bone head move. Put the boat on the trailer first time perfect.Lock her in and pull away.OH OH,seems hard to pull half way up the ramp.Yep,this time I forgot to raise the out drive.  Stop the truck,say a few words that cant be said here.Get out,raise with no prob.  Oh, Im going to love this new boating.  Back out in the AM."
363503,danbouck,2009-07-17 22:17:00,4380,Looks like she really moves. I decided to get a dock this year because I was sick of doing the bonehead moves at the launch!
363507,fishnsled,2009-07-17 22:22:00,3520,Sweet ride Brian.
363509,Twocoda,2009-07-17 22:24:00,4130,"In the words of the late CHICO "" LOOOOOOOOOKIN GOOOOOOOOD MANG"" ...i didnt notice downriggers in the video ...did i miss something ?  Congrates and enjoy!!"
363536,misfish,2009-07-17 23:39:00,29133,None on yet Twocoda.Looking at one Saturday. Also looking at a kicker mount for her.Hate to have to paddle that girl.The boat that is.
363539,John,2009-07-17 23:46:00,2956,Pretty cool Brian. Looks like she handles the big water well..........(the boat that is).....
363548,misfish,2009-07-18 00:34:00,29133,"118 views.It,s ok you can call me a dumb ars.LOL   John she seen that,LOL"
363551,medmart,2009-07-18 00:47:00,587,Looks like the boat runs good a back up motor would be a good thing to add what are you looking at 15 or 20hp?
363553,misfish,2009-07-18 00:57:00,29133, Nothing big bro.Just maybe a 9.9.  Have you stopped laughing yet? LOL  I have.  Cant believe what I did today.Rushing to much. Much more attenttion is required with these bigger boats.
363585,Sinker,2009-07-18 03:23:00,8692,"No big deal on the gong show Brian. You gotta learn one way or another  I've learned lots of things the hardway. Sometimes thats what it takes to get it thru your skull........well, in my case anyways  You guys are going to have a lot of fun in that boat. Throw a couple riggers on there and your all set. An evening troll on the bay on a nice evening after work........ya can't beat that!!  A kicker would be a great addition for sure.  S."
363598,Cudz,2009-07-18 04:19:00,2652,Hey Brian.  I did the exact same thing with mine getting her out of the water the first time.  I thought I trimmed it up but had a dead battery and with 3 kids talking in the boat I did not hear that the trim was not actually working.  I pulled the boat out slowly and heard a clunk.  Not cool!  Immediatley stopped and managed to hook up a battery booster to get the trim to work.  I did however put a small ding in a brand new prop    Been out 2 times since and have been very good at remembering to lift the outdrive.  My last 3 boats have all been outboards so it was always easy to see if the motor was up or not. Your boat looks good. That storm did dump some rain on us.
363616,Chuck Best,2009-07-18 09:31:00,308,"Hey 'B',If your out again today ,look for the Smokercraft,the outlaws are here for the weekend ,and I'm out for a little bit in the morn......TC and tight lines.....Chuck...."
