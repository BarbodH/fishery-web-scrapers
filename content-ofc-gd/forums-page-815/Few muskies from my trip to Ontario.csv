363053,mattyk,2009-07-16 20:15:00,2110,"Well my trip to Canada ended and it was too short for me. I was able to get out and fish 4 times in the Kawartha area. All 4 times I was able to land a musky, nothing large, but pretty fun to have a fish on the end of the line. I had several large follows on a double cow girl and some big spinner baits, and they followed on the 8 a couple of times but no takers. I trolled, and nothing. I threw suicks, manta's, cow girls, grim reapers, believers, etc with no luck. So I down sized a little bit to a smaller crank bait and all my fish came on the same lure. I also caught a walleye and a nice largemouth on the same bait.      "
363081,Rich Clemens,2009-07-16 21:35:00,3131,4 Times out and a musky each time.   Many on here would love that kind of record (I certainly would). Congrats on a sucessful trip.  As they all are ... the trips end too quickly.
363112,brookie87,2009-07-16 23:23:00,11,"I dunno if you went to pigeon lake or now but ive landed a few nice ones in there. i goto a lake often where you can catch 10 musky on a good day (all under 6-7lbs) a few monsters a year. seems to be the way she goes. its a small lake tho. lots of fun, you see more fish than you catch. topwater is riveting, when you not reelin in the skis its the bass. i hope the musky are hungry next week.  have a great night!   go leafs go."
363151,jediangler,2009-07-17 01:09:00,1923,Nice fish Mattk. I'm going to the Kawarthas for two weeks this Saturday. Any chance you could PM me that secret lure? Have you ever musky fished at home in the cave run lakes in KY? I heard they stock Tigers in those lakes.
363254,solopaddler,2009-07-17 10:55:00,8605,"Nice fish there Matt, looks like you enjoyed your trip!"
363256,Roy,2009-07-17 11:01:00,13728,You look like a pretty happy dude in those pics Matt. Good on ya. Looks like a good time for sure. Secret lure eh?
363266,Whopper,2009-07-17 11:44:00,2174,Only one thing wrong with your report Matt.......you didn't take me with you  Good to see you get back home and catch some fish
363287,cuillerierk,2009-07-17 13:29:00,32,4 for 4  that's pretty darn good.   I wish I had a record like that.   Nice fish.
363297,mattyk,2009-07-17 13:57:00,2110,"We have some musky lakes and rivers here. Cave Run and Green River are the most notable. I have fished both. No tigers, just purebred muskies."
363666,Leecher,2009-07-18 15:35:00,7832,Great report and pics Matt 4 for 4 just doesn't get any better than that    Congratulations and thanks for sharing Leechman
363717,Jonny,2009-07-18 19:04:00,1380,"Never having fished for muskie, and only ever having caught one (incidental), I'm always intrigued by them.  What you call small looks pretty good to me! (by pike standards). "
