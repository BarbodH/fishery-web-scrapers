No need for flaming or hostility. Either the kid knows his stuff, or he's a 'google' angler or a 'cut n paste' artist. I've seen a few who take written opinion and post them, word for word, as their own. Some very blatant, and others less obvious. Do not hold his age against him as there are some amazing young anglers here. Some of us older types also grew up with rod and reel in hand and posessed the experiences many will only dream of in a lifetime. We should remember that. This site also, like many sites, posesses its share of armchair critics. Quick to speak if something displeases, but very quiet when it come to solid contributions and fishing reports.  Lastly, we are talking about fishing. A pastime that should provide endless satisfaction. It is not Polisci 101 so lighten up.  For those self proclaimed fishing gods so full of there superiority over us ""lesser"" anglers, as my uncle would say, stick yer head in a bucket of manure and swallow."

I guess it's the feel of beng in international territory while being on the water ... and even our regs specify the fish size in both Inches and cm ... for me it will always be inches ... jeesh a 50+ if you mean cm is more like a minnow  As for the other garbage .. sorry dudes I'm with Art all the way... suck it up young fella ... people around here (and most places in life) appreciate honesty and respect ... we got enough Bull everywhere else in our lives ... our culture at least around here ensures every one is welcome to share from what we have to offer, but in return for that priveledge we do ask that they have the respect for the rest of us to acknowledge and abide by our culture and rules.

Everyone has a red flag sensor embedded into their heads ....if you dont believe a certain statement ...take it with a grain of salt...chuckle and move on ...  Honestly ...who is to say the character at the center of this debate is even 16 years old and not some ole dude in a wheelchair with a large knowledge base of the area he was discussing in HIS thread ...  From what i read ...he was merely trying to help out ...im surprised no one jumped on him for being too forth comming with his information..granted he started off a little harsh in other threads but ...chalk that up to his age of sixteen ( as stated) and inexperience in social forums or chalk it up to his old age and his anger at the world for putting him a wheel chair and not allowing him to be on the water anymore...  Purely speculative of course ....but who really knows ....  With the powers that be of today ...just ask him what derby/tournaments he won...the internet is a wonderful thing for research

363481,Twocoda,2009-07-17 21:24:00,4130,"i just read this ...thought it might an an interesting addition to this thread ....  copy and pasted  Teen Threatens to Hijack Plane in WoW, FBI Arrests Him People can't be serious    World of Warcraft is the most popular MMORPG in the world, scoring almost 11,5 million paying subscribers every month. Out of all these people, you can definitely imagine that some of them aren't really the brightest tools in the box.  Such is the case with an 18-year-old boy from Johnson County, Indiana, who decided to see just how serious Blizzard was about the discussions in World of Warcraft, and decided to repeat a threat that he “was going to board a plane at 7:30 to Chicago and that he was going to try and kill as many Americans as possible.”  Needless to say, the teen was reported by a facilitator from an online gaming center and the authorities were called in. When confronted with the fact that the FBI seized his computer and were looking seriously into the case, the teen said that his account had been hacked and that he hadn't said any of those things.  The truth surfaced though, and he finally admitted that he was kidding around and wanted to see just how everyone around him would react to such threats. Quite badly it seems, as charges might be filed with the US Attorney's office, but they haven't been made just yet. It definitely seems that the teen has learned his lesson and if he plays WoW in the future he won't make any other wild threats to the homeland security of his own country.  Sadly there are certainly a lot of other people who won't learn anything from this story and will continue to believe that online games, be it World of Warcraft or not, are like a Wild West-like place where everyone can say and threaten whoever they want. Until the next guy or gal reaches the news, be careful about your bragging online."

363672,Fishnwire,2009-07-18 15:56:00,983,"There are a couple of reasons why he got jumped on a little bit.  Think about what went on...   I will say, I've lived in Sudbury for 32 of my 37 years, I can tell you that as far as the fishing info by specific body of water, the kid's info checks out.  I know it's kind of general in nature, but enough accurate little details were included to indicate to me that it wasn't all total Bull.  Based on the actual fishing info provided, I'd have him in my boat.  Some of his other claims, I'm less certain of.  When a 16 year old kid shows up somewhere and says he's won $32K in tournament winnings and already has a scholarship at a top Canadian university, its not surprising that others may question that.  Heck I'll say it...I'm fairly certain both of those claims are lies and it makes me tend to think anything else he says is quite possibly also a lie.  It's a credibility thing...like the boy who cried wolf.  As far as the grammar and typing goes, none of us is perfect.  However, the only thing that bothers me is when somebody commented on it to him, he basically said, ""I know my typing is terrible, but I don't care.""  For someone who spends so much time on a public forum, he should try to care a little.  When I am attempting to communicate with others using the written word, I employ a simple tactic that our young friend obviously is not familiar with...Think about what you'd like to say, type it out, TAKE A MINUTE AND READ IT BACK TO YOURSELF, make corrections as necessary, and only then hit ""Add Reply"".  Spellcheck is a great tool aswell.  I guess I'm trying to say there's a difference between having poor english skills and just being lazy or sloppy.  Lastly, and more troubling, is that he seems to be going for the record for ""most locked threads"".  And it's not like all his threads are about unions, gun control, or whether or not we should be in Afghanistan...they start out pretty innocent, but a page or two in, and everybody's feathers are ruffled.  The OFNers who've speculated that this might be a troll in 16 year old clothing might be on to something.  I asked myself a couple of times, ""Is this guy for real?""  All that said, I'd be lying if I said I'm not curious to see what he comes up with next.  I'm getting a kick out of the kid.  As far as I'm concerned, the locked threads are almost always the most interesting ones...and I've said before I think the mods are a little too quick to shut threads down...if a OFNer finds a thread is going in a distastful direction, he or she is free to go to a different thread.  But hey, I don't run the place, and those that do are doing a fine job.  I spent a good 15 minutes writting this reply, I hope the thread's not locked when I go to post it!"

I learned from this mistake I made last year and here I am, made some friends, met some members and I can't stay off this community forum. This really is a great place but sometimes put yourself in the shoes of the guy defending his self.  In this last scenario, he was sharing info, might of told a few fibs but who are we to judge and say what is right or wrong. As the saying goes, ""don't judge a book by it's cover"".

363392,Jonny,2009-07-17 17:32:00,1380," There's something to be said for reserving judgement.  He was admonished early on to post something useful, and he tried. That's a point in his favour.  I think the responses that have to do with picking apart spelling and grammar are a bit out of line. I'm a stickler for them (that's why you'll often see my posts edited) but I know we're not all like that.  My advice to him would be not to try to defend himself by posting claims that he can't prove, just try to keep posting useful contributions and it might all work itself out.  You have to admit he's got some pluck. I think what he has to realize that there are some pretty knowledgeable guys here who will pick apart something suspect pretty fast.  I wouldn't be surprised if he disappears pretty quickly (and to be frank the situation is to a significant extent of his own making) but I hope he sticks around.  ---  EDIT - I went to put a link to this topic on the other thread so he wouldn't miss it, but it was closed. This topic may suffer the same fate. Might be a good thing, I'm not sure."

363422,Jet,2009-07-17 18:35:00,364,"What I really enjoy about this site is reading about other people's reports and seeing pictures of a good day (or bad day) out on the water. What I've noticed a lot lately that more often than not is someone cannot post a report without someone finding something to point out to flame the reporter for:  -You're holding the fish wrong! -I can't believe you killed it! -You should blur your background! -You shouldn't blur your background! -You're using the wrong kind of net! -Your fish is out of the water!  Sometimes it is warranted, but often someone goes out of their way to take good pictures, spends the time to detail his/her report and gets jumped on by someone that wants to hear themselves type. For example someone will assume and flame a reporter for holding a fish by the gills or laying it on the ground without first establishing if they released the fish or kept it for consumption. It's things like this that prevent people from sharing their experiences here, which is the whole point of this community. I hope this discussion can help create better awareness of how we all communicate with each other."
363423,aplumma,2009-07-17 18:42:00,6896,"  You are correct it is not the age that makes the difference it is the creditability that makes it so.  Here is an example:  Fishing the Niagra Falls area by the Peace Bridge.  First of all I have found that the left side of the bridge on the USA side holds a lot better cover especially the area that leads to the deep holes were the current breaks are by the red buoy. I use a black spinner that has a gold feather body that is trolled fast and just below the surface. I have picked up some good size bass down river were the green buoy is along the edge were the rocks change more to a white color. I also have had great luck with the walleye bottom bouncing a yellow jig tipped with minnows along behind the bridge supports.  While all of this sounds good here is the rub.  The closest I have come to fishing that area is I drive across it on the way to Lake Nipissing. The information that I have given to anyone here is very broad with just enough detail for someone to waste a days fishing looking for the points I have given to back up my fantasy trip.  If I presented this information as my own and professed that it was factual when it isn't then I have not done a service to anyone.  You will find that their are some people that over the years have given information on things that they have proven they know something about. If Bernie says something about a mechanical issue you can Bet I will take it to the bank. If you have a question on metals the you would do well to ask Wayne for an answer. When someone comes on the board and uses it for his personal play toy and continues to laugh at the people to see if they will swallow the next line of Bull then I will step in again and again and call them on their line. If you come on the board and speak the""truth"" and embellish the size of the fish then you are a true fisherman... if you come on the board and make up a pack of lies and present them as factual with no creditability or are proved wrong with people who do have creditability then you deserve to be reminded that your Bulling and it isn't needed nor is it appreciated.
