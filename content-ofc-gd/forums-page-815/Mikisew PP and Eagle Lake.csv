I'm been doing some research but having a tough time as there are a lot of eagle lakes in Ontario and I'm not sure if I'm getting the right info. I will be fishing mostly out a kayak or canoe. I'm assuming it's mostly bass, pike and walleye in there. Does anyone have any experience fishing this Eagle lake they'd be willing to share?  Thanks"
