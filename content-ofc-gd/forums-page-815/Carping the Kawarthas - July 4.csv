According to my friends, I didn’t miss much in terms of action around my local swims in Toronto.  It literally went from deep freeze to instant spawn within a few days and the numbers of big hungry fish that usually school up in the shallow bays and flats never really happened.  2009 so far has been my toughest carping season in a long time with numbers averaging 1-4 fish per session along with a fair number of blanks mixed in.  A couple I caught early last month around Toronto while fishing with DSN      Yesterday my dad and I hit up one spot in the Kawarthas to see what the carping action was like.  When we got to the swim, we were greeted with strong currents that had 5oz of lead bouncing along bottom.  To our surprise Photoz was already there fishing (unfortunately without any luck).  We set up in an area of slack water, baited up the swim with corn and a groundbait mix and waited…And waited…  Around 8am, my alarm goes off and I’m into a fish that strips tons of line off the reel.  I managed to tease it out of the main current and land it.  One around 23lbs – First fish in almost a month   The ducks really like Photoz’s bait   It was a slow day overall.  I think the cold front which passed might’ve had something to do with that. We still had fun fishing with Photoz and chatting with Rodpody who came by to see how things were going.  Rodpody even let me have a few samples of the lead sinkers that he makes along with some cow pellets I could try mixing in with my groundbait – Many thanks Ron.  In the end, my dad lost 2, I landed 1 and lost 1.  Photoz caught a duck that swam into his line and got lassoed – I managed to grab it and unravel it from the line without getting pecked.  Hopefully I’ll be able to get out during the week…Gotta make up for all that time I lost"

Glad that you're feeling all better now, we have to get out together soon."
358741,Badger Shark,2009-07-05 19:07:00,291,"Good to see you got out and caught some fish.  I can relate with the health issues and not getting out much.  I have had two surgeries in the past 4 months.   Next time I need to make sure I have them in the winter months! I really like the second pic, nice colours."
