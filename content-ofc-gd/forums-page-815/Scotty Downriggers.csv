363676,danbouck,2009-07-18 16:10:00,4380,I just purchased 2 scotty manual downriggers off kijiji for a great price. I have never used downriggers before so had no idea what to do.  I decided to go on their website to see if I could find some installation instructions or general info and found all the info that I needed right away. Not too often does that happen.  So for now Scotty gets a big    and we will see how they work.  Dan
