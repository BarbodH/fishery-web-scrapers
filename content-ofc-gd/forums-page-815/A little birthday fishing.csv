While I was waiting for the bus I decided to take a few casts in the Speed River downtown. This is what I got on my 3rd cast.   After heading out to Caledon, I rested up and left bright and early Saturday morning hunting for brown's at a secret location (can't post a pic sorry)  Had a 20"" brown on,  got it close to shore then it spit the rap.. go figure.  Wash, Rinse, Repeat.  Same spot, I cast out under a cedar tree and BLAM fish on... though it turned out to be a nice sized pike. Once again spitting the lure as I get it close to shore... not a real loss like the brown though!  Anyways... As I'm walking back up from another hit and miss from another monster brown. I caught this little guy  Great little 10"" rainbow (but very surprising to find them up this far)  I'll post a pic in a reply"

364059,GreenCanada,2009-07-19 21:41:00,375,"Then I headed out to another little secret location... and caught some more rainbows!!  This one here is about 11-12"""

When I mean low, there is about 2"" in a creek almost, which leads into a series of deep holes (about 2-3 feet deep). So I took my ultralight, barbless hooks, and dew's.  I caught about a dozen of these, this was the biggest rainbow (5"") and I didn't keep any from here.    Hope you enjoyed those, as I enjoyed my birthday weekend greatly...  Cheers"
