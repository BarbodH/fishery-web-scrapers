Once all the boats went in and the waves disappeared i put on my spoon and tossed it over a weedline hoping to find a Musky or two. Well, didn't get into a Musky, but did end up with a Pike which I was hoping was a Musky that didn't know it was hooked, haha.  Heres a pic of the Pike, and some nice shots of the sunset and clouds.          Hopefully we find the Musky and Walleye next time."

363274,BillM,2009-07-17 12:47:00,17367,I hope you didn't release it
363284,cuillerierk,2009-07-17 13:19:00,32,Nice pike man.
363445,ciceri,2009-07-17 19:46:00,535," Nope, I remembered reading on here that everyone kept the ones they caught, so we kept this one as well.  Thanks everyone."
363534,glen,2009-07-17 23:32:00,2641,Nice pike Ciceri.  I hope you catch and eat them all.
363556,angrypigeon,2009-07-18 00:59:00,31,is it safe to eat a pike of that size?  issues with mercury build up?  especially for a teenager - wouldn't want his growth to be stunted
363583,Victor,2009-07-18 03:12:00,1609,"Nice fish, but it's just sad to see... we've received so many confirmations of pike being caught at Balsam, I wonder when they will really take over that lake.   he's probably not going to eat another one like that for at least another month or 2, so it's not going to be a problem."
363650,Leecher,2009-07-18 14:12:00,7832,Great looking gator Ciceri It should give you a couple of nice filets!!!  Good table fare for sure  Leechman
363697,Rich,2009-07-18 17:20:00,3927,"Nice pike! Too bad it was from that location, but good on ya for getting rid of it. Though I think if there's pike swimming around in Balsam that size it may be too late to kill them off.  Bet it was a great tasting fish though. I love fresh pike."
363767,ciceri,2009-07-18 21:16:00,535," I don't eat fish. We gave it to 3 different people. And I'm 6' 3"" and done growing, hopefully, haha."
