363925,Fang,2009-07-19 13:36:00,1330,looks like I'll be in Temagami a week late again!!!
363929,Big Cliff,2009-07-19 14:02:00,6899, You can bet that if it was the other way around he wouldn't be posting it on this board LOL!
363936,Jonny,2009-07-19 14:30:00,1380,Whoa! I just noticed the post count for Irishfield! Is that the record for this board???  
363942,irishfield,2009-07-19 14:47:00,26272,Of course you're correct Spiel !!  We can't thank Carole enough for bringing us food and helping pack and load for a good 6 hours on Friday. (along with taking all the clothes to a worthy facility)  Leah and I left home at 7am and packed stuff from 9 am to 10 PM on Friday... then 9am to 10pm Saturday.. home at 1am this morning.  But at least that is done.. now we just have to unload a 24 ' car carrier and two trucks somewhere...  And Jocko... post count is not a sign of intelligence.. don't worry about it.
