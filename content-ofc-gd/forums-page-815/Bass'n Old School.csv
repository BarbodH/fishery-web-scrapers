363734,bushart,2009-07-18 20:16:00,2628,My son is home this weekend for a visit so it was off to the lake and found the fish in familiar old haunts.  Windblown rocky points ---classic looking smallie territory.  To top off the old school pattern they were hitting tubes --low tech but always a good weapon at times  Bushart

363777,Rich,2009-07-18 21:54:00,3927,Good stuff! I'd hardly say dragging tubes for smallies is a dated tactic though!
