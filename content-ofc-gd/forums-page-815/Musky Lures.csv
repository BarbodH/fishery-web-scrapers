I recently made an online purchase of some Salmo Musky lures from Ken Bellaire at Ottawa Valley Tackle in, you guessed it Ottawa. I did an online deal with Ken and had a great experience. I really enjoyed finding good lures at good prices in Canada, by the way Ken gives OFC members 10% off. Buy local and support those smaller business guys, they really deliver great service as opposed to the big box stores."
363647,Roy,2009-07-18 13:39:00,13728,NICE!  I'd say that ol' Ken would be a prime candidate for an OFC banner. Contact me if you/he's interested.  Why do I feel a Backwoods ad about to happen?
