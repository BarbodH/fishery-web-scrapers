363753,Jonny,2009-07-18 20:51:00,1380,"I look at my post count and for a ""new guy"" it looks pretty high. Too much enthusiasm for a new-to-me forum I guess. I should probably forego some of the enjoyment I've found in posting here. There's a danger that if you post too much, others might conclude that you don't have a life."

363800,alphaalpha,2009-07-18 23:27:00,475,i'm sure lots of people surf alot at work and whatnot to pass the day...   when on breaks and lunch ofcourse.
363801,Greencoachdog,2009-07-18 23:27:00,8163,I love it when folks bash my post count!!!  ... most of the time it shows/tells me they're grasping for straws!  I've heard all about the high post count/ you dano't have a life thing... but if someone has enough time to worry about how many posts you've made on a particular message board... how much of a life do they have??? Hmmm?  Posting is a sign of participation!........................and once you hit 6000 posts you're GOLDEN eh!!!... or so I've been told.  Keep up the good posting Jocko.. it keeps the board from stagnating!
363803,Jonny,2009-07-18 23:29:00,1380, Right on. And the bonus is that this site is PG-13.
363806,Jonny,2009-07-18 23:34:00,1380," I had to SQUINT to see that word.   I use the 'OFC Club' skin for this site.  --  Thanks for the kind words, gents! I'm having an indecent amount of fun at this."
