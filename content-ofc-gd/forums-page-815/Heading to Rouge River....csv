364129,rocheleauc,2009-07-20 01:00:00,205,"I've fished the part right near Lake-O in the rouge-hill area many times.  I've only caught bullheads, but theres always plenty of people carp fishing there and the last few times there I've seen a lot of fairly big ones being pulled out.  Apparently theres pike in there and I remember a small one being pulled from there many years ago.  Good luck."
364131,Weeds,2009-07-20 01:09:00,782,"I fished the Mouth of the Rouge a few times about 7 years back. Didn't have too much luck. I remember there being plenty of Carp and tiny Catfish. A few bass in there too but they were  few and far between.  Some old guy said there were some pike in there too. I remember not being able to walk up the river, fishing spots were kind of limited."
364206,ehg,2009-07-20 03:14:00,2666,"Have fished the Rouge at this time of year just above the 401 and caught lots of smallmouth bass and some perch on small spinners. Actually did this a few times years ago, but  probably still fish in deeper pools around bends. Same thing at Duffins around Hwy 2. Good Luck!"
