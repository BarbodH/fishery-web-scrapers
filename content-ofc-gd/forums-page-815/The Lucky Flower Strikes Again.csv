Soon enough after I put the magic flower behind my ear and instantly was into another brown. This one too was a decent one but was dwarfed by the one I lost. Caught on a Blue Fox spinner, silver blade yellow fur.    Hit a couple spots after that real quick but the little lady wasn't feeling too good so we headed home. Back at 'er today."

Glad to see that the brown fishery is still that good. Maybe I'll take a drive that way with the ultralight before the end of the season."
