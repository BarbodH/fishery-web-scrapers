363823,Twocoda,2009-07-19 00:31:00,4130,"wrong time of year for trout..,bows anyway...im sure some locals will chime in with good info   Good Luck"
363826,castgame,2009-07-19 00:36:00,161,"i was hoping for browns (i hear there are some around), and maybe the odd resident bow or brookie. water looks low though, don't know that it's navigable..."
363879,castgame,2009-07-19 04:27:00,161,guess i'll give it a shot and report back!

Oh and watch out going through the golf courses, they tend to treat anybody in a canoe as a target."
363960,castgame,2009-07-19 16:20:00,161,"i'll remember that about the golf courses. right there at old baseline there's the caledon club, i thought it would be a funny thing to float through it on a canoe. i don't think i'd get as far as norval anyway... likely only float down to terra cotta or so--i'll still have to paddle upstream!"
