But this wasn't your regular looking carp....at least I hope not ALL of them are THIS UGLY!!  To make a long story short... I decided to head out with a buddy (Jip) to our closest body of water...Lake O. I take out my ULTRALIGHT with 6lb Test and about 50 yards of spool left (was too lazy to add more)... Anyway, float fishing with Gulp!Alive stuff... anyway... I notice the bobber going down... but not in its typical ""fast/quick"" action... almost like its ""stuck"" like in a river...so.... I go to set the hook... the fish somehow managed to get the hook wedged in his eye...now, im not 100% sure how it happened... but it did! I'm assuming he somehow cruised into it... but didn't notice the line nor the hook...  Anyway.... Here are the pictures....  If ya look closely.... NO EYE on one side!!   An even close inspection confirms it! DEAR GOD ALL MIGHTY this thing is damn ugly@@   Flipped him on his other side...oh look! at least he has 1 good eye!!   Anyway.. that's my post. Mr. Carp... I'm sorry for the eye!  I hope he's gonna be ok. I still (even to this day) still feel bad about that fish!"

363242,Cudz,2009-07-17 05:56:00,2652,"That carp's good eye certainly makes up for it not having a second one.  So let me get this straight.  You managed to hook the one-eyed carp in his good eye?  Wow, and you thought your day was bad"
363288,cambo,2009-07-17 13:34:00,62,"That carp's only eye sure is ugly now,i magine the next guy that hooks it,lol"
363303,hammercarp,2009-07-17 14:12:00,964,Even with no eyes a carp can still do quite well. They have an incredible array of sensors that help them find food. And just to play devil's advocate. Do foul hooked fish count?
363329,smally21,2009-07-17 15:19:00,993,that fish would lose a beauty contest to an old tire.  congrats on catching the ugliest fish ever!
363331,MCTFisher9120,2009-07-17 15:30:00,3761,"What kind of reel is it?   Nice...well congrads on such a fine....no...  Good job on catching your first carp...there fun to catch, and best of all there easy to catch!  Thanks for sharing, MTBF"
363337,wolfville,2009-07-17 15:36:00,396,"Not too ugly from the picture in my opinion, but that carp does look odd."
363357,Rich,2009-07-17 16:35:00,3927,"Yeesh! And I thought the carp around here were the ugliest around.. that one takes the cake!  Nice fish though, must have been fun on that setup!"
363611,rbaquial,2009-07-18 06:47:00,968,"MTBF - I think its either a QUANTUM OPTIX 20 or the QUANTUM ARRAY 10... not too sure. hahaha... got both reels tho  I feel bad still about the fish - even when I look @ pictures of it!  I hope it survives (which, I'm sure it will be ok). SUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUURE WAS UGLY!!"
363657,Leecher,2009-07-18 14:36:00,7832,Ugly or not... it's still a good size one!!!  Congratulations on your PB A2F Thanks for sharing Leechman
