363606,sneak_e_pete,2009-07-18 05:15:00,540,"Honestly, I have dreamt of this day for years.  I finally bought my first ""real"" boat.  I have had a 12 ft. aluminum with only a old 6hp on it for a few years, but I have always wanted something bigger.  I found this boat on the trader site on Wednesday and drove 2 1/2 hours this morning to buy it.  I will actually pick it up next week.  Here are the details: 1996 Alumacraft Backtroller - 16 ft. tiller 2001 Mercury 40hp ELPT  It has lockable rod storage for up to 7.5 foot rods, comes with 3 pedestal seats, livewell and baitwell, and lots of storage.  I've got a 55lb. Minnkota bowmount that I bought for my 12 footer (with a 16 footer in mind) that I am going to put on it.  I am pumped.  I do have one question though.  I have a 10lb. anchor on my 12 footer.  Will that be fine for this boat?  Thanks for reading."
363609,Twocoda,2009-07-18 05:41:00,4130,Congrates on the new purchase ..post some pics when ya get her home ...  yes a 10 pound anchor is adequate  I have a 10 pounder on my 17 foot glass boat and 15 pounder on the 28 foot glass
363621,Handlebarz,2009-07-18 11:13:00,3790,congatz on the new rig I hope you have many great days on it any pics? it sure is a great feeling to get a new to you boat I know that feeling waiting for the right one to pass by.  As for the 10lbs depending on what kinda weather you will be fishing in it should be fine
363624,Roy,2009-07-18 11:49:00,13728,"Congrats to you on the new boat. Must be nice. Yes, take pics and post them please.  As for the 10lb anchor. Weight of anchor is not as important as type of anchor. I'm sure it'll do fine. My boat is 16'9"" and I use a 5lb anchor on the river (the Larry) and it holds just fine. Just make sure, and this is important, that you have a long anchor line and that in between the line and the anchor you have 4`of good quality chain and you`ll never have a problem."
363635,aplumma,2009-07-18 12:56:00,6896,"Good point Roy the chain makes a big  difference. A lot of people think the chain is for abrasion resistance but it really is what gives the anchor the ability to dig the flukes in. I have a 28 LB plow anchor on a 7,000 lb boat and with the chain I have anchored out in 5ft waves without pulling free.  Art"
