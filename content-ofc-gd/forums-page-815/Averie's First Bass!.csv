363416,The Urban Fisherman,2009-07-17 18:29:00,2050,"My daughter Averie was bugging my wife about fishing all day yesterday, so when I got off work Ginny says "" Ryan, take Averie fishing tonight she's been driving me nuts all day""... God I love that kid!    Anyways, we didn't have much time, so I decided to take her to the ""nursery"", a creek down the road that holds loads of small fish.  Averie's a pro when it comes to crackin' off bluegills, and she wasted no time in catching a handful right away.    After she had her fix it was Daddy's turn to toss around some baits.  Today's a choice, a white spinnerbait.....and first cast produces a little gator... When Averie tell's the story, it was a HUUUUUGGGEEEE pike!    Second cast, same spot - a decent little largie, actually a big bass for this spot.    And the release...    Now that Averie know's there's bass around, she want's a to finally catch her first one...  First she warms up with a few more bluegill, and finally a BIG HIT (for her - she's little) a short battle ensues, and finally her first bass EVER emerges from the slop!    And her first lip hold.    After catching her prized bass she had no interest in fishing anymore and wanted to go home to tell mommy, but I was able to sneak in a couple more casts before leaving and managed another little gator, and a tiny bass on the spinnerbait.      Even though our fish weren't much to brag about, I know the memory of Averie's first bass will stay vivid in our minds for life.  On the way home we enjoyed a nice sunset.    Once arriving home we found out that our well pump was broken, and we had no water, but who cares.  Let's hop in the little pool for a few minutes to clean off the fish slime and end the day on a high note reguardless.    After a long day in the office, it was a great night with the kid.  Cheers, Ryan"
