My question is do I need collision insurance ?  I'll be riding mostly gravel cottage roads with the odd trail ride , the rest will be work use and possibly ice fishing ...  "

1003527,Fisherman,2017-05-15 20:43:00,7201,Collision insurance is directly proportional to the odds of you crashing if you drive like some of the loogans I see on the trails.  It's the ones that run into you I'd be vigilant of.
1003534,Jds63,2017-05-15 21:04:00,1365,"Thanks guys , but I was wondering if you get stopped by police , is there a requirement to have collision insurance? If you have to ride on a road to get to another property or trail what do you guys insure for ?"

If you have to ride on a road to get to another property or trail what do you guys insure for ?  There is no legal requirement to have collision insurance on an automibile; so I doubt that there is one for ATVs.  If you are financing the purchase, you may be required to have collision & comprehensive in addition to liability.  That is way it works with cars & trucks."
1003565,captpierre,2017-05-16 00:39:00,2521,To ride on public roads you need: Helmet License plates Insurance. I suspect only liability is required but not sure.
1003584,Jds63,2017-05-16 01:32:00,1365,"Broker didn't mention liability only fire and theft , she did mention collision if it was being financed . I'll ask them again what is the minimum requirement for insurance coverage , if I do happen to be on a municipal road."

I'll ask them again what is the minimum requirement for insurance coverage , if I do happen to be on a municipal road.  Probably because the liability is mandatory while fire & theft and collision are optional."
1003627,RickOnt,2017-05-16 13:31:00,669,Hey Julian  You will need liability ins to license the bike.   and to ride on any public trails and lakes.  What bike are ya looking at?  Cheers Rick
1003652,gaspumper,2017-05-16 17:10:00,393,You will need liability to ride anywhere off your own property.

1003667,TJQ,2017-05-16 19:32:00,7806,If your financing it they will likely want all in...
1003736,Woodsman,2017-05-17 03:36:00,1286,Just because your insured doesn't mean you can ride on public roads. It will depend if local by-laws allow you to. If you plan on ice fishing inquire if your covered on the ice for liability? Some insurers graciously provide a free rider prohibiting operation on the ice (Intact is one).
