1003193,mistaredone,2017-05-13 12:51:00,913,Looking for a new utility spinning reel.  I'd like to keep the price around $200. I've always bought Shimano stratics but I'm open to other brands
1003214,Sinker,2017-05-13 16:22:00,8692,I wouldn't sway from shimano myself. Hard to beat the stradics.  S.
1003224,GBW,2017-05-13 18:43:00,8460,/\/\/\ same
1003228,bow slayer,2017-05-13 19:14:00,1074,"Check local Canadian tires they had Shimano  Saros 2500 on clearance  for 99 bucks regular 199. I know the Brantford , Cambridge  and Woodstock stores did show some left a coup[le weeks ago. Just check clearance items on website and pick your store."
1003229,manitoubass2,2017-05-13 19:29:00,11391,Yep. Best reel imo
1003233,GBW,2017-05-13 19:50:00,8460,"Check local Canadian tires they had Shimano  Saros 2500 on clearance  for 99 bucks regular 199.

1003238,mistaredone,2017-05-13 20:50:00,913,All gone from CT
1003240,GBW,2017-05-13 21:18:00,8460,"All gone from CT  one in stock in Lindsay and you can have it shipped to your store, clearance $194.99 Stradic FK.  http://www.canadiantire.ca/en/pdp/shimano-stradic-hagane-body-fk-1000-spinning-reel-1784372p.html#Clearance"
1003289,scuro2,2017-05-14 05:09:00,904,"The Quantum Cabo, and it's cheaper cousin Boca, are great reels. Not sure why the love for only Stradics. Cabo at $199 at Basspro"
1003291,manitoubass2,2017-05-14 06:10:00,11391,Function and quality
1003300,MCTFisher9120,2017-05-14 12:42:00,3761,"Check out the new Shimano Ultegra Spinning Reels it's a new line from Japan that has replaced the ""Saros"" line of reels. Price sit's at $209.99 I believe super nice if a Stradic is out of the budget. The Nasci it impressive also at $139.99 Shimano is kicking ass these days in spinning/casting reels. Always have I guess but there mid range stuff if a lot better than it use to be. Check em out and good luck always fun getting a new reel."
1003301,buick14,2017-05-14 12:46:00,741,"^^ I would listen  Stradic has more love than most quantum lineup due to overall reliability, nuff said."
1003309,John Bacon,2017-05-14 13:15:00,3277,The one Quantum reel that I have owned didn't make me want to buy another one.  Shimano reels that I have owned have made me want more Shimano reels.
1003310,scuro2,2017-05-14 13:29:00,904,True...quantum makes many reels of varying quality...but you get what you pay for. Then again I've had a number of crap Shimano reels fall apart on me. Salt fishermen put high end quantum right up there with the best of all reels. No better test of reel than salt fishing. Do check out the Cabo also.
1003312,bow slayer,2017-05-14 14:11:00,1074,"I have 4 stradics,one I bought back in 1991 or2 that still works beautifully,another one that I bought in about 2000 ,same thing still works great and 2 newer 2500 FJs I bought in the last 2 years hopefully they will last as long as the first 2. I also grabbed  Saros on clearance from CT last month,hoping it is in the same quality level. Great reels I would not even consider another brand,although I had a Cardinal Gold Max that lasted about 20 years that was a great reel."
1003316,dintymoore,2017-05-14 14:30:00,62,Daiwa reels have never done me wrong
1003321,Sinker,2017-05-14 14:51:00,8692,"Me neither. I have no issues with any diawa reels.  I also have a couple 1000 size Ardent spinning reels that have been fabulous so far. 3 seasons on them, hardwater and spring panfish. They are great.  I liked pfleugers too until they fell apart. Salt water smoked em! Never again!   S."

I was able to get up here for 270 CDN taxes+shipping all in...not too bad"
