So after about 8 times I kind of smartened up and realized that maybe the new fluorocarbon leader line I just bought was no good so I tried last years floro line ( exact same stuff, 8lb test ) and it also broke. Maybe im just stronger then I thought or was not doing the knot right but once I switched to a much stronger leader it went together ok. Just how easy should 8lb test break when wrapped around your hands, both spools I had seemed to break way more easy then I would have expected. Then I set up my wife's new reel also.

I have seen 30 pound Big Game break by hand after sitting in the sun. Usually especially when stored on the spool in a rod holder left in the Sun.

1003044,Lape0019,2017-05-12 13:43:00,647,"This is truly a chevy vs ford thing but you are missing out by only using mono. I do not use a lot of flouro either though but it does have its purpose.  Flouro does sink while mono floats and it does not absorb water (I don't think mono does either though). As for keeping its strength, that is dependant on what happens to it. Flouro will be more abrasion resistant to things like rocks and teeth but if you get a kink in it, you will lose close to half of the tensile strength listed. It is also more picky with how you tie your knots so make sure to lubricate them well before cinching. The friction of the line rubbing together causes enough heat to reduce the strength of the knot so this is key. Also, use a line conditioner with each use to make it more manageable. it does make a huge difference.  With that out of the way, I tried using more flouro and just can't do it. It's just not as manageable even with conditioners to make it worth while in all circumstances. I use straight flouro for crank baits as it has the sinking advantage and I use a leader for wacky rigs or drop shot. Out of the 10 rods I have, 7 have braid, 2 have mono (spinnerbaits and a topwater/crankbait rod) and 1 has straight flouro (strictly cranking). I will tie on a 5-10 foot flouro leader depending on what I am doing with the braid sometimes though.  The only way to determine what is right for you is to try them out."

Depending on application im either tying the two lines together with a uni knot or most of the time just simply tying both ends to a raven xxxs swivel so that I can tie directly to the lure and avoid line twist.  I really really dislike using snaps at the lure for anything except top waters.
1003050,adempsey,2017-05-12 14:18:00,1498,"Fluorocarbon as a main line is horrible.  Not worth the cost and headache - at least, that's my experience.  There is nothing wrong with mono at all.  Floating and stretching are important for a lot of fishing styles and not that much of disadvantage for most others.  The advantage of a superline is no stretch = more sensitivity.  If you fish jigs, shaky head, drop shot or other finesse methods, it might be an improvement for you.  It also lasts longer.  So, the up front added cost balances out and might end up being cheaper in the long run.  That being said, the really thin diameter lines are a PITA if you ask me.  I don't go below 15lb test braid on spinning gear.   All braid I run to a fluorocarbon leader.  That maintains the no stretch aspect and if I need to, I can break it.  I've also use hybrid lines as leaders.  Also, as someone else mentioned, if you need some stretch it's not a bad choice to stick with mono, which some do for trolling. It's mainly for the shock absorption, which allows a better hook set.   I suppose you could use braid with a long mono leader as well.  Mono to fluorocarbon. leader I don't really see any advantage.  The whole ""invisible under water"" claim is bogus from the ""research"" articles I've read.  Hybrid (fluoro coated mono)  lines are not too bad.  I like them, but they vary a lot and you'd have to experiment to find which one you like. The P-Line Floroclear wasn't too bad, but I didn't like the 5lb test. Yo-Zuri was decent too, but had some memory issues."

1003094,Headhunter,2017-05-12 18:42:00,5703,"Well, I had Floro on my spinning outfit for a couple of years. i used it all year round (Seagar sp) and as cold as -30. I never had a problem with it. It might have been that it was 6lb test and therefore more ""subtle"" then the thicker stuff, but it worked great for me. HH"
1003103,LittleWorm,2017-05-12 19:42:00,122,"So for the ones who are using a braid with a fluoro leader how are you connecting them? Uni knot, surgeon's knot, directly to a swivel? How long of a leader do you use?  Sorry for so many questions, just always looking for advice to try and better my fishing game!"
1003104,BillM,2017-05-12 19:50:00,17367,Depends on what you're fishing for but I like to use XXXS barrel swivels to connect flouro (or mono leader) to braid.

1003109,BillM,2017-05-12 20:07:00,17367,It's good they're cheap

Micro-swivel is good too, but I don't find it any easier or better than the double-uni."
