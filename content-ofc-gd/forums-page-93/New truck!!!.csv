1002504,buick14,2017-05-07 11:56:00,741,"I love the look of the new chevys and fords, but ended up picking the ugliest one out there - ram 1500 ecodiesel because of fuel mileage.  Well, that was a mistake ... live and learn I guess.  All you people with your sexy trucks I had a neighbour growing up who was a hardcore molson ex drinker who drove a blue Dodge Ram-he used to scare me with it and peel up and down the street.  His name was Chester .  Long story short, I had to try one for myself...."
1002509,camb,2017-05-07 14:19:00,3,I just picked up a new Silverado nice truck
1002548,limeyangler,2017-05-08 00:35:00,5204,Cool truck bruvva!
1002549,smithy97,2017-05-08 01:07:00,70,"My 2005 Silverado Z71 5.3L is still going strong, love that thing! Congrats on the new ride!"
1002551,manitoubass2,2017-05-08 01:39:00,11391,"Fun part was teaching the wife today. She's never drove a truck in her life, so that was pretty fun offroading, hill climbing and parking lessons lol  Thanks again guys!"
1003279,tomkat,2017-05-14 03:11:00,246,Ford Raptor kills everything no?

1003327,manitoubass2,2017-05-14 15:40:00,11391,Good read!  Partially explains why it's so hard to find a used one.

1003350,manitoubass2,2017-05-14 17:21:00,11391,"I too tested these in the oilfield.  Best truck ever. But, the one I want is 20 grand over the Silverado, which was our second choice.  It's actually the similar truck my dad wanted, but couldn't get approved for, so he got a fully loaded dodge 2500  He's pissed at me right now lol"
1003361,Mister G,2017-05-14 19:59:00,1429,20 G's more.............O U C H  ! ! !
1003364,Old Ironmaker,2017-05-14 20:12:00,8243,"My next door neighbour bought his new then 2011 F-150, similar to Wormdunkers. I was impressed even thought it was a Ferd. I went to see the dealer he bought his from for a price I liked it so well. Nice interior and a lot of bling, 22 Grand more than I paid 22 grand for some chromed plastic and plastic wood is crazy. GM gave me $3500.00 to retire my 88' Sierra with over 600KMs on it that was worth scrap price plus the newer battery, which they let me take out. Add that to %10,000.00 cash incentive and $2500.00 scratch and win and I'm under 30 grand than the 52 grand Ferd. And he has had nothing but problems including a scored cylinder that happened outside his warrantee date. He had a hell of a time keeping air in the tires because of the not round alloy wheels which he eventually had changed under warranty but Ford put on much cheaper steel wheels and zero cash allowance. Some silly stuff like the plastic wood popping off."
1002387,GBW,2017-05-05 18:27:00,8460,I just got home with the new 2017 Cruze Hatch 6-spd and man it's fun
1002388,manitoubass2,2017-05-05 18:32:00,11391,Sweet dood!!!! Gonna save some mula on gas too!
1002389,GBW,2017-05-05 18:38:00,8460,Sweet dood!!!! Gonna save some mula on gas too! Yes for sure but Ins does cost $400 more a year than the 2007 Ram 1500 cost.
1002390,GBW,2017-05-05 18:40:00,8460,"here it is...  even a custom plate, lol! "
1002392,manitoubass2,2017-05-05 18:41:00,11391," Im shocked, our insurance is ok. Im still jealous of Saskatchewan though lol  Not sure if it's still true but it's used to be like 400 a year, possibly less"
1002393,Mister G,2017-05-05 18:41:00,1429,"And just think, the oil fields ""might"" just keep that truck from rusting away.........LOL  Enjoy the new ride and no speeding for the first month....."
1002395,manitoubass2,2017-05-05 18:45:00,11391,"Hahaha. Don't work out there anymore. I'd never bring my vehicle in the crap we drove through.  Can't speed here either. Super trap on either side of emo because of all the American traffic. Youde be amazed how many people get nabbed going through a town of like 2500  Toronto trip soon though, hell with gas prices, im taking the truck instead of the suv"
1002396,manitoubass2,2017-05-05 18:46:00,11391,Nice!!!!
1002402,manitoubass2,2017-05-05 19:07:00,11391,  And she's home????
1002423,Old Ironmaker,2017-05-05 23:28:00,8243,"You sound like the guys at the Steel Plant that would never drive their good vehicles in there. OK to bring our frail human bodies in there but never our shiny cars and trucks, C'mon Man! If it's good enough foe me my Vette is fine.   That is one nice ride Rick, congrats. A coat of New Finish once every few or 3 years will keep it looking new forever. With the new clear coats out of the GM factories no wax required. Not for the unfortunate, for owners repairing daily (FORD) or the goat trucks. Imagine naming a line of tuff trucks Goats, bhaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa."
1002427,manitoubass2,2017-05-05 23:55:00,11391,"Lol, work trucks mAh man. Not even allowed your own vehicle(insurance related)"
1002430,ecmilley,2017-05-06 00:06:00,2163,"nice truck, much better than the liberty may it serve you well"
1002432,Mister G,2017-05-06 00:18:00,1429,"oh I do, just not for you It's hard when all you have is a parking spot at the local town trailer court, but hey at least you keep trying."
1002442,misfish,2017-05-06 01:35:00,29133,"Yes for sure but Ins does cost $400 more a year than the 2007 Ram 1500 cost.  When I went from the 2012 Avenger, to the 2014 1500, my issuance dropped $400. Interesting."
1002444,muskymatt,2017-05-06 01:46:00,2608,Gotta love a Chevy! My 5.3l Silverado is amazing. Congrats!!

I'm no insurance agent, but these days I think they look more at how likely they'll have to pay out for parts to fix YOU not the vehicle in the event of an accident.  You're less likely to get hurt (or worse) in the RAM than in the Avenger.  Used to be the crappy little 4 bangers were cheapest to insure, not anymore."
1002452,leaf4,2017-05-06 01:57:00,2466,"Similar thing happened to the girlfriends dad, from what he was told if he was in an accident in his f150 vs the Elantra, it was likely the damage would be far worse on the compact car vs the truck"

I'm much safer in a truck vs a car is what they claim and also it's a car that is 10 years newer than the Ram was."
1002468,Old Ironmaker,2017-05-06 15:30:00,8243,"You mean to say it's a company vehicle that is yours to use exclusively? Nice. Usually all the trucks we had inside the plant were OK but zero bling, manual windows, no carpeting not even A/C, yours is bling on bling.  A word to the wise Rick, my good friend was in sales and had a beautiful car that was a company vehicle. Hid daughter borrowed it with his permission and totalled it. In the fine print of his lease agreement she was not covered to drive it, him and him alone or another employee of the company. To his amazement he wasn't even supposed to drive it unless on specific company business. After that happened everyone at his office and others I know that had company vehicles including myself for a time got a rude awakening. Ask and if they say yes get it in writing."
1002471,grimsbylander,2017-05-06 16:00:00,3016,"Wow, he's in sales/executive and didn't know that his daughter would not be covered under the company insurance policy? Letting anyone that is not an employee and generally 21 years old or older, is not covered and cannot drive the vehicle regardless of getting permission."
1002472,manitoubass2,2017-05-06 16:26:00,11391,"No I bought this truck.  I mean when I worked in the oilfield I always had a company truck. No personal vehicles allowed, understandably"

I can attest to this. Professional Engineers hired to test product who need me, the Technologist who does an engineer's work, to set up tests and explain how to interpret real world results.  PS. Nice target... I mean truck. Got to keep a close eye on new trucks around here."
1002484,manitoubass2,2017-05-06 23:54:00,11391,"Thanks!  Not much vehicle theft here, so im not worried about that.  Too small of a town/area"
1002489,Old Ironmaker,2017-05-07 00:31:00,8243,There's enough vehicle theft where Tom S. a I live has the highest percentage of vehicle theft in the country according to a recent Hamilton Spec. article. The Cops know exactly who steals them and where they end up. 5 vehicles have been stolen from the lot at my wife's store this year. I wonder why my phone can take HD videos and store security cameras take grainier pictures than a 1910 silent movie?
1002316,manitoubass2,2017-05-04 19:54:00,11391,"After using basically every truck imaginable in the oilfield/mining, I finally found one I was happy with buying and pulled the trigger.  "

1002318,Old Ironmaker,2017-05-04 21:06:00,8243,"Well at least now I know you have good taste in both women and trucks. I drive a 2011 silver grey Chevy Silverado, crew cab, with the chrome package including running boards. First ""new"" vehicle I ever bought for myself. Actually it was a gift from Tich. Based on the chrome wheels it is close to if not a 011'. Welcome to the F-150 and Ram killers club Richard. I can't give you any advise on what can go wrong because I haven't had to do anything outside normal service every 12000 KMS. Tires, brakes are all normal wear and tear. Changed front pads last week at 110,000 KMS and put new tires on, Cooper Discovery. The Discovery's are more aggressive than the all seasons that came with it new. The only thing hat happened within he first 10,000K was rear brake adjustment and a slight leak in the rear gear case. Don't forget to run her in 4X4 high once and a while as well as low for a few hundred meters.  Congrats on buying a real truck."
1002324,aplumma,2017-05-04 22:43:00,6896,Awww sorry I would have stopped you if you had told me. After all friends don't let friends drive chevys.    Very nice truck though.  Art
1002326,esoxansteel,2017-05-04 23:35:00,1307,"Very nice truck Rick    Im a Dodge man by heart and soul, got it from my dad, but i really like those new Sierras, and Silverados, especially with the after market accessories available, and the front grilles matching the body panels."
1002332,manitoubass2,2017-05-05 00:05:00,11391,Thanks guys!  OI it's a 2016  I've owned many vehicles but never a truck. Pretty excited about it!
1002336,BassMan11,2017-05-05 00:15:00,583,Gteat choice MB2. I made a purchase myself last week. You will be happy with it      Ready for the season. Now if the water levels in Ottawa would just go down a bit we will be all good to go!
1002338,manitoubass2,2017-05-05 00:40:00,11391,^^^ nice ride! Both of em!

1002345,Old Ironmaker,2017-05-05 01:38:00,8243,"Rich a Ford, why oh why, the humanity.  I haven't seen those chromed slot wheels on any Chev after 2012. Interesting. Looking closer yes she is similar but has the rear bumper step up that I really need, actually I need a ladder now to get in the box. I'm really surprised a northern boy like you has never had a pick up. Living on the 36th floor in a downtown apt in 76' I had a pick up.  Nice ride Bassman. My last truck was a 89' Sierra, she went away with 600,000 K's on her. GM gave me 3500 bananas on a GM loyalty trade in. And other than all the body metal gone it ran like new, the frame was solid still."
1002346,leaf4,2017-05-05 01:52:00,2466,"All of our work trucks have this sort of ladder on them, they're awesome! The post on the left is to grab and pull yourself up if you need to lol  "

They all have upsides/downsides  Ideally I was going to buy a tundra, just couldn't find the right deal. $65,000 is alot of mula.  But im more than happy with this purchase, as is the wife. We REALLY needed a second vehicle"

Can't hear them on the long drives, no worry about spilling juice boxes and all you have to do is hammer the brakes to get their attention!! That's some solid family planning!  PS That's the exact truck I'd buy. I have the same model and colour in a 2012 and haven't had a single issue."
