1003333,manitoubass2,2017-05-14 16:03:00,11391,"Awesome!  As if your vids aren't enjoyable enough as it is, now it's about to get EPIC!  im sure it's bound to happen, but I hope you get some really good wildlife shots to include"

As if your vids aren't enjoyable enough as it is, now it's about to get EPIC!  im sure it's bound to happen, but I hope you get some really good wildlife shots to include    That is going to be a challenge with the drone given the new regulations. There were loons, swans, beaver and deer all out there yesterday but 75 meters away from animals, people, vehicles, boats, buildings etc.... (yes, the actual rules state ""etc"" as something you have to avoid) is going make it difficult, there is no zoom on the drone lens and 75 meters away is pretty far away."
1003335,manitoubass2,2017-05-14 16:20:00,11391,"Ah still cool to get say, a moose swimming island to island.  Im not talking about harassing them lol"

1003340,manitoubass2,2017-05-14 16:39:00,11391,"Bummer! I've seen it quit Abit on Mainville and surrounding lakes. Always cool to see  Saw a bear once too  But mainly we see them drinking at waters edge super early on the lake, so cool to watch"

1003344,manitoubass2,2017-05-14 16:56:00,11391,"Oh dood, have you fished wellar? That's another good one for wildlife. And tupman, schotoze,"

1003348,manitoubass2,2017-05-14 17:16:00,11391,"Hahaha, sure. Youll have to help a cripple out though. Pretty tough getting around on a blown out knee"

There is a fine line between guts and stupidity....lol. I have some pontoons installed so at least I can retrieve it and I am insured for 2 crashes, water damage etc....with $100 dollar deductible.     MY MAVIC.  "
1003362,Jds63,2017-05-14 20:05:00,1365,Very nice Simon !
1003367,spincast,2017-05-14 20:18:00,3279,"love it, spectacular. G is in awe too (""You're kidding me, that's where he lives? and he has a drone. He's the only guy on the lake!-"") he has the $100 version of the drone and drools every time we go into Best buy."

I'm bad for following the rules but, up there who is going to call it in or enforce it? I want some close ups lol"
1003400,chris.brock,2017-05-15 01:27:00,4053," Lookin' great Simon. Very cool technology.  Is that ""follow me"" mode when you're boating with speed through the narrows?"
1003406,mj2112,2017-05-15 01:59:00,46,Nice video! I bought a mavic pro for Xmas and I am still learning how to fly it.  I bought it to do the same thing you are doing. Where did you get the floats for the legs and the insurance? I saw some cool vids where the drone is hovering to where the fisherman was casting topwater baits and it captured some cool strikes. Have pred birds attacked it yet?
1003419,LittleWorm,2017-05-15 02:56:00,122,Great video man.
1003422,Old Ironmaker,2017-05-15 03:15:00,8243,Shots anyone can get now that would cost thousands to rent a chopper to get just a few years back. My brother got one for XMAS and after reading the new guidelines I forward to him from here he says there isn't anywhere he can legally and safely fly it. There is an airfield behind his place up north and 2 neighbours have float planes. He was so looking forward to try it out besides in the house chasing his dogs around this weekend at the cottage. What's a hobbyist with too much $$ to do?  More please Simon.  edit: have you figured out how to harness Jack to it yet?
