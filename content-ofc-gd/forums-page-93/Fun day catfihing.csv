1003122,manitoubass2,2017-05-12 21:01:00,11391,Clinic!  Nice edit too  Always pictured cat fishing to be kinda slow. That looks like one heck of a productive day!  Jealous! And great net jobs too btw
1003143,Old Ironmaker,2017-05-12 23:26:00,8243,"Good for you. I was told by a local to stay out of it because of all the debris. I was by there just today and the river below Dunnville looks like chocolate milk, the dark kind. The timbers for the slips at the Dunnville Marina are usually out of the water 3 feet or so and they were peeking out, barely. I am surprised you risked running hat river with all the crud in it now. Buy a Lotto Max ticket for tonight.  That music hurts us old f ers ears. The same 4 cords on each and every Heavy Metal ditty. At least we have Cats in common, right? We did get into a few before it rained. The rule for me is to hit that section of river the week the buds on the trees turn green, it has never failed so far, again good haul. Ever keep a few yellow bellies for the pan Steve? I can tell you they are sweet. 15 bucks a pound US now in the Mississippi River area, and they are muddy not nice and firm like ours in cold water."

1003149,Old Ironmaker,2017-05-12 23:55:00,8243,"Get down here, they will be on the bite for a few more weeks at least."
1003178,LittleWorm,2017-05-13 06:19:00,122,"Great video man, I loved the part when you stopped the music so we could hear the reel screaming."
1003914,Bill Shearer,2017-05-18 21:13:00,456,"I got into a few today, in the same area. Some good ones still around! Thanks Steve!"
