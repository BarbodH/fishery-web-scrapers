1003705,GBW,2017-05-17 00:07:00,8460,Well on the weekend I passed the locks in Fenelon Falls and all the work they were doing on the locks is done and they had the upper section filled up.  I'd hazard a guess they should be open.  Is there no number to call and listen to a recording with info?
1003706,GBW,2017-05-17 00:09:00,8460,Locks open May 19th @ 9AM https://www.trentsevern.com/
1003707,FishFinder17,2017-05-17 00:20:00,139,Locks open May 19th @ 9AM https://www.trentsevern.com/   Would recommend to anyone that uses the locks regularly to go on to the parks Canada website and have them mail you the free Canada 150 parks Pass - Locks are operated by Parks Canada and with the pass you can lock for free all year.  Happy 150th Canada!  FF17
1003753,Sinker,2017-05-17 13:00:00,8692,I heard they weren't 100% sure yet on the radio this morning. High flows are messing things up.  S.
1003780,lew,2017-05-17 15:39:00,12766,I don't know about anywhere else in the system but the water is a couple feet above above normal at both Young's Point and Lakefield Locks and with the dams pretty well wide open the current is very strong and moving unbelievably fast.  Can't really imagine they'd want anybody trying to navigate thru the white water on the downside of the locks.  I'm guessing the entire Otonabee River would be pretty tough too.  The local boat ramps are closed too.  Here's a couple pics I took this morning at the Young's Point lock.

1003812,fisherman7,2017-05-17 18:45:00,325,Just announced they are closed till next Friday. No surprise.
1003813,captpierre,2017-05-17 18:47:00,2521,Wow!
1003838,GBW,2017-05-17 22:56:00,8460,"Just announced they are closed till next Friday. No surprise. Yes, I just heard it on the radio on my way home too."
