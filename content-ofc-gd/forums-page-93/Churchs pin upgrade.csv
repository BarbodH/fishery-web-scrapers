1003687,misfish,2017-05-16 22:28:00,29133,They seem to be cheap to buy online.  http://www.xtackle.com/Church-Tackle-Replacement-parts.aspx   Have them throw in a mail envelope. Send snail mail.
1003693,floater,2017-05-16 23:26:00,220,Ouch. I just tried to order on that site and it's 12 bucks for the parts and 48 bucks to ship! And that is American money! I'm hoping for a store near the GTA thanks
