1003618,KraTToR,2017-05-16 11:54:00,506,Looking to launch on Pigeon this Wednesday and I'm wondering where to launch as many marinas are under water.
1003632,captpierre,2017-05-16 13:49:00,2521,Not sure but Gannon Narrows Marina has a good slope to concrete launch. Maybe call them.

1003653,Hank Jr,2017-05-16 17:12:00,146,We use the public launch on Bass Lake Rd just outside of Bobcaygeon . Not much parking but the launch is Ok we have a 19 1/2 ft Bass tracker and launch no problem . Its also on the north end a couple mins from Big Island

1003767,Sinker,2017-05-17 14:22:00,8692,"Yes, there is a dock, but it may not be there right now.  I usually launch in bobcaygeon. Go over the bridge, first right on anne st, follow to the water. There is usually a dock there too, but the water is so high right now, I don't know if it will be in. I haven't been on pigeon yet.  S."
1003788,fishindevil,2017-05-17 16:37:00,6254,the dock in town in caygeon at the launch is not in yet
1003790,fishindevil,2017-05-17 16:39:00,6254,2 days ago the launch was underwater and the river is almost on the road there in that spot
1003837,moxie,2017-05-17 22:51:00,1566, Maybe the whole Marina is under water!?!?! Oh my!!!
1003841,Hank Jr,2017-05-17 23:36:00,146,The one on Bass Lake Rd has a small dock . A friend from another board used it yesterday said he got his feet wet getting to it so the water is up some there also but he launched OK

1003861,Garnet,2017-05-18 13:01:00,2056,Didn't know why I bought hip boots 5-6 years ago put I do now.  Wore then all day tues in the boat. Very comfortable.
