1003659,PUMP KNOWS,2017-05-16 18:29:00,937,Can you make a vid of setting and collecting your minnows.
1003666,TJQ,2017-05-16 19:30:00,7806,Awesome shots!!!   What a view!
1003671,DanD,2017-05-16 19:42:00,2223,Is the play back slowed down or is that in real time? Regardless great vid!  Dan.
1003680,Rizzo,2017-05-16 21:57:00,4754,pretty big minnow pond you got there!
1003702,spincast,2017-05-17 00:00:00,3279,"what a beautiful evening,"
1003718,limeyangler,2017-05-17 02:08:00,5204,"~~~Great shots from the Drone, but didn't see any minnows ...LOL...takes a little bit longer than 1/2 hour to catch 'em!  Drone footage looks great Simon !!! Did ya check out Uncut Angling's latest video from Palouse Falls for some inspiration ....  Hmmmmmm....I like the show but he kinda bugs me, how dare he catch all those wicked fish and get paid to do it!   Can you make a vid of setting and collecting your minnows.  Ya never know    Awesome shots!!!   What a view!  Thanks T.J.   Is the play back slowed down or is that in real time? Regardless great vid!  Dan.  No, its real time, with the 3 axis gimbal on the drones camera it gives it that liquid smooth feel.    pretty big minnow pond you got there!  Well, its not mine exactly....lol.    what a beautiful evening,   Sure was, what a difference a day makes, today was bloody miserable, and the black flies have hatched!"
1003849,Raf,2017-05-18 02:01:00,3495,man that's cool.  how much flight time out of a charge?
1003850,mikeh,2017-05-18 02:20:00,824,that last location looks like a good crappie spot when they are spawning?
1003857,limeyangler,2017-05-18 11:45:00,5204,"man that's cool. how much flight time out of a charge?  DJI says 27 minutes at 15mph or something like that. I find I get maybe 15 minutes as I don't like flying it once it gets to 30% battery power just because the Return to Home feature on the drone gets triggered when the battery is low.  Because I'm mostly in the bush or over water the idea of the drone trying to land itself (especially when Im in the boat and have moved) freaks me out a bit. You can pause return to home and take over manual control, and set the height for return to home plus the drone has front and down Obstacle avoidance, but for now I'm playing it safe and learning the basics before I get carried away...lol.  that last location looks like a good crappie spot when they are spawning?   I don't think there are any predators in that pond, the reason why it produces good minnows."
