I left the seals on i read you can get better results removing at least 1 side rubber cover?  Did 5 or six reels 3 bearings each for a lil more than the price of 1 set of boca  I'd also liked the hedgehog studio tool it was super easy to use and didn't risk scoring shafts   "
1003848,Tom S,2017-05-18 01:54:00,362,"Buddy has the  ceramics in his float reel. I can hear them standing beside him. Ya smooth as hell, but annoying.  To be totally honest I've never understood people's obsession with 'upgrading' bearings on centerpins. If you're worried about start-up you would be focusing on reducing the weight of the spool to reduce the inertia that needs to be overcome. 'Spin Time' is really a bad measure of how good a reel is, but if you're worried about that increase the weight of the spool to increase momentum and give a longer spin time. Bushings would be smoother than bearings once broken in if you're worried about smoothness.  Just seems like a lot of money to 'improve' things that should have been considered during the design stage. Take a look at aerial centerpin reels - lightweight spools with very minimal bearing systems for what I think is the ideal way to design a centerpin  Baitcasters on the other hand could benefit from improved bearings, as they are lightweight spools running at height speed. I think ceramics are a bit overkill, high-tolerance stainless bearings should be more than sufficient."

Take a look at aerial centerpin reels - lightweight spools with very minimal bearing systems for what I think is the ideal way to design a centerpin   Exactly, I starting with centrepins back in the early 80's with British bushing reels and was taught the trotting method of presenting the bait where you were in constant contact with the spool holding back the float so the bait was presented first. Little do people realize the current at the surface is almost always faster than at the bottom and letting your float run with the current with your super dooper abecs only results in the float dragging your bait at an unnaturally fast speed along the bottom behind the float. I was taught to keep your mainline off the water and the float tilted back towards you, no hero drifts , you lose that control ."

At the time, I was through my apprenticeship as a general machinist by a few years and figured I'd just make one!

Hehe..not that great really. It was my first crack at it and I know I could make one so much better now. But it landed more than a few bows!  that thing looks badass as heck  Funny you say that...I had a guy approach me while standing in Bowmanville Creek and offer to buy it!

Backplate looks like my old knurled rim Stanton but you did your own spool design.  The spool was unique. I didn't have access to high speed machines back in the day so I made copper electrodes and used an EDM machine to burn out the spoke pattern. There are a hundred better ways to do it now!! lol Thanks  That,s a sweet pin bud.  Thanks Brian. When I would catch a fish on it, it was more about the fact ""I made it"" than how it performed.

It's funny, I first figured out bearings through Skateboards, turns out its totally applicable to fishing reels.  You will not beat ceramic bearings, tough as nails and smooth as trunkular trees"
1003755,manjo39,2017-05-17 13:26:00,354,I switched out my stock Shimano bearings on an 201e7 and D101s for ABEC7 Ceramics.  Did a spin test on a stopwatch before and after and did not notice a measurable difference.  On casting couldn't tell either other than now the reels are much noisier on the cast.  They'd probably make a great figit spinner though.
1003763,manitoubass2,2017-05-17 14:15:00,11391,"^^^weird, I've had nothing but the opposite.  You know your stuff too so I believe it.  You did oil them right? Of course you did  Ceramic bearing are almost silent, weird your reel is louder after the switch"
1003764,Lape0019,2017-05-17 14:19:00,647,"Tried a set of Boca Abec 7 Orange seals in an older Revo S and they do make a difference. For what it is worth, you realty only need to change out the spool bearings.  With the revo S, the most noticeable difference was the ease of cast to get just as far of a cast. You don't really have to whip the bait out there which is nice and isn't as hard on your body. I did notice a slight gain in distance.  All in all, Although it was an upgrade, I didn't find it worth it. I got similar results with just flushing the stock bearings and adding a drop of oil.  They are much louder and a drop of oil will both quiet them down as well as slow them down a bit."
