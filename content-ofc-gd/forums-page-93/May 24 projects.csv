Aside from all that we needed to level out the backyard as they had a dog run and a playset along the back and had straight dirt/mud in there... Along with another 40 pavers buried in the ground as their dog must've been a digger!  Here's the before:    Here's what we've accomplished since yesterday, 7 yards of triple mix and 30 bags of mulch! (Shy of 2 yards)       Leveled out a low spot in the front yard:    Seeded and watered ready to go:   Apparently it rained last night, I had no clue I was out like a light at 10 and didn't stir untilâ€‹ 7am lol"
1004058,captpierre,2017-05-21 16:43:00,2521,Nice work. The fish are asking for you.
1004064,Mike Pike,2017-05-21 19:27:00,1332,Nice job creating your own little piece of paradise there Lucas.   Looks like a dandy place to kick back with a few 'pops' and tell fishing stories.
1004070,leaf4,2017-05-21 20:17:00,2466,"Definitely! It's funny, I guess the previous owners didn't do much of anything here so I've basically met most of my neighbors just from being outside so much and everyone just pops by to introduce themselves and express how appreciative they are that someone is actually looking after the corner property leading onto their street haha. Feels good that's for sure!"

1004119,LittleWorm,2017-05-22 02:54:00,122,Looks great. Hard work paying off.
1004127,leaf4,2017-05-22 04:49:00,2466,Always something to do...once the grass grows it's more to cut! Haha
