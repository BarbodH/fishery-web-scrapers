1003875,RAO,2017-05-18 16:35:00,13,"So a couple of years ago I purchased a truck camper that slides into the back of a pickup truck.  The idea is that I can take my two boys and wife fishing with little fuss and a bit more comfortable than a tent.  I also have a 14' aluminium boat that I pull behind the truck.  What I am wondering about is some places to go.  I am not looking for specifics but some place that has a reasonable launch and place to set up camp.  I have for years gone to the Shining Tree area but was looking for something closer to home.  Can anyone help out.  Thanks, RAO"

I use to camp at Govan lake all the time, now I just go in for day traps when I can. You need to buy a road/lot permit to go in and you can buy it online here http://northfrontenacparklands.com. There are to spots on Govan lake you can drive into and camp ( the rest are all on islands ) and each campsite is supplied with a Thunderbox. Some really nice fishing in there especially when there's no one else on the lake."
