1003203,limeyangler,2017-05-13 14:36:00,5204,"Hi all,  just wondering what others think. I have been on Cabelas email mailing list for years now, have bought big ticket items from there in the past so they have my details.  For years now though, everytime I open one of their newsletters announcing a 'sale' it seems like they are just selling off crap that nobody buys anyway ( try finding your size in any apparel they have on sale, always only have Small or 4XL)  and the stuff i would buy remains very expensive even on sale. I appreciate having a Cabelas in Winnipeg just because of the stock, but even trips to the store leave me feeling underwhelmed.  When Canadian Tire or say Princess Auto have a sale, there are always a few items that are super cheap and useful. Anyway, I finally decided that Cabelas newsletters were junk...UNSUBSCRIBED."
1003209,Old Ironmaker,2017-05-13 15:25:00,8243,"I too unsubscribed from them Simon, and Bass Pro and Gander Mountain. I see a good sale at Bass Pro, drive the 3 plus hours to Bass Pro near Newmarket and am told that is a US sale only and US prices on the Canadian site too, why? I have never bought anything from them since. I found Cabela's did have some good prices on tackle once, got 25 worm harnesses shipped here from the US and it was Chinese junk. Gander Mountains website pages are so packed with info you have to find an empty spot on the page to put the curser or it opens the item I don't want to see. Turn off hover and my fingers are so fat scrolling the touch screen opens everything I don't want open. I don't need that kind of useless stress in my life. I go to Mom and Pop stores now, there are no deals for me at Big Box guys."

I have never bought anything from them since.  I can't stand Bass Pro for this reason. They can't even bother to create a website showing Canadian prices. It's like they don't want to bother with the Canadian market and we're a hassle to them. Well, if I feel like I'm a hassle to a shop I just won't shop there."
1003225,G.mech,2017-05-13 18:57:00,830,"I see a good sale at Bass Pro, drive the 3 plus hours to Bass Pro near Newmarket  Is there a Bass Pro is near Newmarket?  There is one in Vaughan (1.5 hours from where you are) and there is the one in St Catherine's which should be under an hour...."

1003262,PUMP KNOWS,2017-05-14 01:39:00,937,I wish we had a Cabelas in Toronto.  I wanna buy something off their tent and tackle sale but shipping would kill the deal.
1003264,moxie,2017-05-14 01:47:00,1566,"I just dont subscribe. Ever. If i want or need something i suss it out and get it. Then im done until i need something else. Last thing i need as an angler is a notification attempting to sell me ""More"" of what i dont need."
1003267,PUMP KNOWS,2017-05-14 02:01:00,937,Me waiting for the next tackle sale...  
1003268,Old Ironmaker,2017-05-14 02:05:00,8243,"G. Mech Sir. That trip was well before the NOTL store opened, 1.5 hours is at 3AM and taking the 407, plus it is much further than 1.5 hrs from us, I only wish. Hell I am a good hour from Hamilton now, it used to be 45 minutes to downtown, not anymore. Now it's 45 minutes to Rymal Rd. since they added no less than 4 new stop lights in Binbrook. 1 lane in 1 lane out, what a joke. The actual town of Selkirk is a good 15 minutes from our shack as well. The day I drove there to BPS took almost 4. I said Newmarket which is 10 minutes further because I couldn't remember the name of Vaughn and don't care to remember it. My sis in law lives in Newmarket, even taking the 407 to the less travelled 404 has taken me 4 hours some days. Some days you just have to go through traffic, no question, like when the family calls at 2PM and says if you want to see your sis before she dies leave now. I know exactly how long it takes to get to BPS and Newmarket my friend, exactly.  My showroom and office was under the Garden City Skyway in St. Kits on Bunting Rd, it was exactly 1 hour and 30 minutes from my shack to there. Add another 10minutes to BPS Niagara On The Lake, that's 2 hours on a bright dry day G.  Don't worry G. Mech, where I live is one thing I am positive of."
1003274,LittleWorm,2017-05-14 02:47:00,122,I find with email blasts from PBS its just focused on trying to sell you a credit card. If you want this deal or that deal you need to get their credit card. I have bought a few things off them and their service has always been good. Just tired of them trying to push another credit card on me
1003285,crappieperchhunter,2017-05-14 03:35:00,2582,"I hear you Simon. Back in the 80""s/ early 90's  I found it worthwhile  to deal with Cabela's....from a Canadian point of view....with regards to service and/ or pricing and/or getting things you just could not get here. Then things started changing and I found no more deals or no better quality or service then I could get locally. Still get there catalogue's and browse through them but haven't given them any of my $$$$ for a long long time."
1003307,wkrp,2017-05-14 13:10:00,656,I find Sail to be a very reasonably priced store especialy when they have their 15% off sales and they are a Canadian  store
1003314,limeyangler,2017-05-14 14:19:00,5204,"lol...good to know I'm not alone in my feeling. I find it difficult to understand how these big box stores with their purchasing power fail to pass on any of the savings to consumers, my local tackle stores are a bit pricey but by the time you add on shipping its pretty much the same, plus, with some of the local stores, and I stress 'SOME' you get personal customer service."
1003320,manitoubass2,2017-05-14 14:51:00,11391,"Simon, I forget the name but there is an AWESOME store in Winnipeg that I hit up when im there.  It's by the casino somewhere  It's a big store but not quite Cabela's or basspro size.  I happened to stumble on it a few years back and now I go a few times a year  I'll try to figure out the name for future trips"

The other good store in Winnipeg is The Fishing' Hole on Regent Avenue West. The other storeI sometimes check out is Pro-Am Tackle on Nairn Avenue, They have knowledgeable staff, but the last time I was there I did not buy anything, their prices were through the ROOOF!"
1003325,manitoubass2,2017-05-14 15:35:00,11391,"Yep that's the one! Wholesale sports. Great store IMO.  They always seem to have everything Im looking for  And yes, great staff"

1003363,mike rousseau,2017-05-14 20:08:00,4661,I'll never talk down about a retailer for not discounting they're merchandise enough for my liking... the price is the price...  Hard to run a successful business giving 50% off top selling products every weekend  They offer free shipping almost all the time on orders of $99 and it's rare I can't find a decent deal in the bargain cave  And can't say enough about their customer service  To each their own

1003413,67ZL1,2017-05-15 02:37:00,51,"Cabela's in Canada is vastly different than the U.S. Cabela's. The U.S. site seems to always be running good sales or promotions. They place their Guide Wear on sale regularly for 25% off, and ontop of that they run a 2-3 day promotion for an extra 20% off the sale price. Need to shop both Canadian and U.S. Sites."
1003417,Old Ironmaker,2017-05-15 02:53:00,8243,"Of course I could have, experience is a lifetime of mistakes."
1003840,PUMP KNOWS,2017-05-17 23:06:00,937,I just received a email for Free Shipping with No Minimum Order.  Ordered some lures on sale.  woot woot
1003851,Duckie,2017-05-18 02:33:00,305,Agreed. Sail is good. The St. Catherine's Bass Pro is good but Bass pro tends to be 80% house brand stuff and not much of the rest. at least with the rods and reels.
