1002927,floater,2017-05-11 15:50:00,220,I'm wondering if anyone knows where the last place to get gas before the turn off for Onaman Resort? We will be taking Highway 11 north and west. The owner told us to bring gas with us as a round trip is about 5 hours from the resort. Thanks
1002931,BillM,2017-05-11 16:06:00,17367,I'd guess Jellicoe.
1002954,pics,2017-05-11 18:08:00,1268,Geraldton is the last gas.. The station in Jellico no longer operates. Just a dumpy variety store left now .. When we moose hunt we bring reserve gas from home and always stop at the Husky to fill up.. It's a long drive to get gas when you are up that far...
1002960,floater,2017-05-11 19:03:00,220,Thanks for the replies. I'm figuring on bringing in an extra 100 litres for the boat on top of the 50 litres in the two boat cans. That should cover us for a 7 day trip. Two stroke motor is thirsty. .
1002962,Freshtrax,2017-05-11 19:09:00,2215,Super jealous right now.
1003001,BillM,2017-05-11 23:45:00,17367,"I think the last time I made a trip up there I filled 17 cans before heading in, lol.  Big runs for big fish."
1003038,floater,2017-05-12 12:42:00,220,I just got a mail from Onaman and he said to fill up before I got any where near there as the price is high. Either way it's half price gas cus the partner has to pay half!
1003080,DRIFTER_016,2017-05-12 17:23:00,10439,"Yeah, fill up all of your gas cans down South before you leave!!!! Most of the time prices up there are higher than they are here in Yellowknife!!!!"
1003085,BillM,2017-05-12 18:04:00,17367,"Now how much are you going to save hauling all that additional weight up there?  If it's a few cents more, it totally makes sense to get it before you head into the bush."
1003108,DRIFTER_016,2017-05-12 20:03:00,10439,"Now how much are you going to save hauling all that additional weight up there?  If it's a few cents more, it totally makes sense to get it before you head into the bush.  Last time I drove back to Ontario from YK the most expensive gas I found was in Northern Ontario. It was 30-35 cents a litre more than it was in Yellowknife."
1003131,Freshtrax,2017-05-12 21:48:00,2215,Last summer 99.99 in Kitchener 135ish from nipigon to timmins
1003154,DRIFTER_016,2017-05-13 00:21:00,10439,Last summer 99.99 in Kitchener 135ish from nipigon to timmins  Exactly. That's my point.
1003290,scuro2,2017-05-14 05:17:00,904,Geraldton is the last gas.. The station in Jellico no longer operates. Just a dumpy variety store left now .. When we moose hunt we bring reserve gas from home and always stop at the Husky to fill up.. It's a long drive to get gas when you are up that far...  You are bringing back memories of those one horse towns on that drive across the 11. Who can forget Longlac...where I had to actually stop and take a close up look at that creepy closed down white church.
1003293,floater,2017-05-14 11:01:00,220,It is on the list to see!! Buddy is a photographer so it's 'stop stop stop' and 'slow down' the whole way!
1003386,chris.brock,2017-05-15 00:46:00,4053," I had a similar situation last year. The day before I left I called the last available gas station. I decided to buy it up there instead of hauling it.  When I called I asked ""what's the price?"" and ""are you fairly confident you will actually have gas tomorrow?"", lol."
1003437,pics,2017-05-15 11:55:00,1268,
1003439,pics,2017-05-15 12:06:00,1268,"Be aware of some sections of the highway that have no cell service. You won't have any between Hearst and Longlac and it will be spotty after that until Geraldton. We found service along the highway near the river past the tractor tire road and near the intersection of hwy 11 and the 801 before you head north into the bush.. Be very careful of the log haulers on the 801, they pretty much have priority on the roads. You will have to slow to almost a stop when one passes due to the dust.. Quite often there will be another following... My buddy is heading up at the end of the month to fish and scout for moose..his brother has a trap line south of the ORR.."
1003532,floater,2017-05-15 20:58:00,220,The owner of Onaman told me they are logging up the 801 this year. He said a grader is going by twice a day so at least the road is in good shape!
