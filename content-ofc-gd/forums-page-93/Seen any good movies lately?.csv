1003278,Old Ironmaker,2017-05-14 03:11:00,8243,"I always say Art must evoke an emotion from those the Artist is trying to reach. Depression and angst are not nice positive emotions most movies try and get from the audience like cute Disney flick. The actor pulled those emotions out of the audience, thus an award from his piers recognizing his Art.  I popped La La Land in at 9, I notice it is over and my wife is sound asleep, must have provoked an artistic emotion, like boredom."
1003283,tomkat,2017-05-14 03:26:00,246,Let's face it the Oscars are a joke. There must have been lots of performances better than Affleck. He moped around for the whole movie.
1003288,scuro2,2017-05-14 05:03:00,904,"From the 2017 Academy nominees that didn't win...Lion, Arrival, and Jackie are all movies well worth seeing. Hell or High Water also saw a nomination for Jeff Bridges...great movie and on Netflixs."

I agree Ironmaker I thought the director and Affleck nailed it....anybody that has experienced trauma in their lives be it death or illness or perhaps a dying relationship surely can relate...."
1003302,SirCranksalot,2017-05-14 12:46:00,3291,Yup! Best movie in a long time!! 3 thumbs up!!
1003326,Cast-Away,2017-05-14 15:40:00,790,I watched The Equalizer last night on Netflix which I haven't seen for a few years. What a great story!
1003328,manitoubass2,2017-05-14 15:43:00,11391,"I watched Martian last night, and although a little over the top, I thought it was entertaining.  A few pretty funny lines in it too! In a dark sense of humour"
1003478,blaque,2017-05-15 15:44:00,2419,"I was just going to post about Split that is out on DVD now. Just watched it last night. Yes James McEvoy's ""beast"" was a bit over the top I think. The real Beasts such as Jeffery Dahmer, Ted Bundy and Charles Manson don't seem to mirror the image that was portrayed in Split. Manson maybe. Makes for a more interesting movie I imagine. I dated a woman once that had multiple personality disorder, I swear, my friends called her Sybil.  Enjoyed this one quite a bit.........but was disappointed with the morphing of the real character into the ""beast"" at the end. Thought it should have been kept in the real world. Although it could have just been the portrayal of the main characters interpretation of the beast. Either way, i would have rather seen things stay in the human realm lol  And the very last scene of the movie went right over my head and really ended up ticking me off. I never saw the previous movie that it referenced"
1003490,Old Ironmaker,2017-05-15 17:37:00,8243,Yes that's was the point I got disappointed as well. I hear what TomCat is saying about over the top. Just like in Boondock Saints when the Willem Defoe character had a nervous breakdown on the front lawn. Almost ruined the entire flick for me. I will watch it once and a while and stop it there.

1000418,Old Ironmaker,2017-04-15 06:43:00,8243,"Rented ""Passengers"" with Chris Pratt, Jennifer Lawrence and Michael Sheen. It was a lot more than I expected. Swiss Family Robinson in 500 years from now, or a good Lost in Space, Michael Sheen plays the robot. I recommend it.  This isn't movie time of year but we don't do much anymore after dark, I didn't say nothing after dark."

Hands down top 5 action franchize in my books.  Saw LIFE and although I dug the 70's-80's low fi vibe, (where in that time we didn't think film characters no matter how smart they were supposed to be, were above making really stupid decisions, unlike today)  but ultimately outside a few slightly gory deaths it lacked tension & fell flat."
1000428,Old Ironmaker,2017-04-15 11:35:00,8243,"Haven't caught John Wick 2. I liked the first one after I stopped yelling at the screen and realized it is only a movie. There is no such human weapon as John Wick. Plus I cried when he smashed up the classic cars, no CG there but the new fake Chargers should all be totalled."
1000430,lookinforwalleye,2017-04-15 12:41:00,4399,the word good and movie is pretty uncommon these days....I rarely pay for a movie these days as my streaming device allows me to watch pretty much everything....Passengers was actually pretty good....I could watch Jennifer Lawrence all day....Kong Skull Island....  seriously another monkey movie....there should be a law to prohibit more monkey movies....I have not seen nor do I plan on watching John Wick 2....3...or 4 saw number 1 and that was enough...Did watch Aftermath with Arnold the other night it was okay.  The best entertainment is on the small screen these days....Billions....Walking Dead...Homeland...Ray Donovan...Outsiders....Designated Survivor to name a few....

These are all well made movies every week.    We need to give Canadian TV a closer look. It's the incessant commercials that stop us from peeking at them. Canuck productions are so much better than they once were."

I won't spoil it, see it Academy Award winner for Casey Affleck and he deserved it.  I can't say I enjoyed Designated Survivor at all. Even with commercials I gave it a shot because I really like Keefer Sutherland. He plays Jack Bower as POTUS, I know he is talking because I hear him but his lips don't move.  We have checked out most all of the Oscar winners over the winter. I fell asleep during BLA BLA Land. The right Oscar winner was announced right the first time. I could watch Jennifer Lawrence recite the phone book.  A great Canadian movie I liked over the winter was the movie about the Canadian Forces fighting the Taliban out of Kandahar Airbase Afghanistan starring Keefer Sutherlands son Rossif Sutherland and Paul Gross. Hyena Road. Excellent flic and well produced."

I didn't sleep that well that night. I read about the inquiry after watching. They really tried to hang the female Control Room operator out to dry, but couldn't. Her boss panicked big time."
1000616,Tom S,2017-04-17 01:12:00,362,"If you like thinking movies to break up some of that action, try The Big Short about the market crash a number of years ago and A Faster Horse about the redesign of the 2015 Mustang for the 50th anniversary.  Based of my impression of you from here I feel you would like Imperium, about the FBI infiltrating a neo-nazi group in the US."
