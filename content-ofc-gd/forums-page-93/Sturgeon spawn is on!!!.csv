1003879,AKRISONER,2017-05-18 17:23:00,5558,whats the biggest one youve seen?  and are they catching them and smoking them up there still or what?
1003881,BillM,2017-05-18 17:40:00,17367,Dive in and hug them.
1003883,manitoubass2,2017-05-18 17:49:00,11391,"Bill, their so chill you can just grab the tail. I haven't done it but I've watched as rrfn collects for the hatchery  Akri, we smoke a few. Maybe 10 per year ish. Again, I don't because it's illegal, but my wife's uncle does.  Biggest I've seen was the one I caught on walleye opener 2014, no official measurements but I'd say 8' around 90-100lbs  I've seen bigger watching the spawn though. Probably around 140lbs free"
1003891,Headhunter,2017-05-18 18:28:00,5703,So cool to see... thanks for sharing. HH
1003894,Acountdeleted,2017-05-18 18:46:00,2562,Wow. Great pics.
1003897,PUMP KNOWS,2017-05-18 20:03:00,937,"Awesome, hows the sturgeon population over there?"
1003902,OhioFisherman,2017-05-18 20:19:00,6623,Cool! they look bigger than the carp here! LOL
1003906,grimsbylander,2017-05-18 20:34:00,3016,That's so cool to see! I get excited when I see a smallie!! lol
1003907,manitoubass2,2017-05-18 20:36:00,11391," If I sit on the patio at night, you can watch them jump, thousands, hours on end  Truly beautiful"
1003908,manitoubass2,2017-05-18 20:39:00,11391,"I wish I could get better, but it seems year after year, the spawn happens in flood waters.  My camera won't catch what my eyes see.  In the second pic, you probably see 3 sturgeon?  Im seeing hundreds"
1003909,manitoubass2,2017-05-18 20:45:00,11391,"Older pics, 2015 I believe. But here is some females we bring up to the sturgeon farm. We release after we get fry, then a few months later we release the fry            "
1003910,LittleWorm,2017-05-18 20:48:00,122,We have them here in the St.Lawrence also but you are not allowed to fish for them or keep them. Last year they found 4 of them locally in the river that had been cut open and the eggs removed then the rest of the fish just thrown back into the river. Last I checked they have not caught the person/persons who did it. They are such an awesome looking fish.
1003911,manitoubass2,2017-05-18 20:59:00,11391," But, we can't fish for them, but mnr will allow a c&r photo.  I still try my hardest to stray from them as they are major nuisance when walleye fishing  I posted a photo years back of I think 4 fish netted and left in like 8"" of water to die, ill see if I can find the pic"

1003915,grimsbylander,2017-05-18 21:19:00,3016,"http://www.news-herald.com/article/HR/20130626/NEWS/306269945  They are in Lake Erie but very rare to see one or even hear of one being caught, that article is from 2013.  Actually, sturgeon hook ups aren't really that rare in the Eastern Basin of Erie at all. The issue is, because 95% of the fishing is bass and walleye on spinning tackle, it's just that...hook ups. A 4 footer will peel you clean in no time."
1003916,manitoubass2,2017-05-18 21:28:00,11391,"A 24"" sturgeon will spool you lol. They can fight like crazy, or just sit on bottom, nothing you can do to make them come up on walleye gear  But.... My biggest one came on 8lb test and a 6'6"" rod. It took an hour but I got her. Although I felt like my rod was gonna snap the whole battle lol  Sturgeon make the most insane runs ever."
1003917,misfish,2017-05-18 21:37:00,29133,Great pics Rick.

I can believe that, even the bigger carp I have caught would have been more of a mystery if I hadn't been in a boat to follow my line."

1003977,esoxansteel,2017-05-19 18:29:00,1307,"It's unreal. I have no scientific numbers but I'd say in 200km of river it's in the millions  If I sit on the patio at night, you can watch them jump, thousands, hours on end  Truly beautiful   That is encouraging Rick evolved through hundreds of thousands of years and still a healthy population,  thanks for the pics"
1004053,Moosebunk,2017-05-21 16:00:00,3970,Cool shots Rick!  Love thems sturgeons!
1004054,buick14,2017-05-21 16:10:00,741,"^correct.  Although rare, I would actually believe 10 reported sightings each year for sure ."
