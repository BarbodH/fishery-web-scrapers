1003265,kickingfrog,2017-05-14 01:56:00,8333,My son has been counting down the days until we could go fishing and today was the day. Early start and we were on the water by 6:30am.... 6 hours later we had the first bite. Four fish landed and one other on and off. There was no sign of life until after 12. The sun came out for a bit and that seemed to make a difference.  3 on husky jerks and one on a swim bait.    
1003266,PUMP KNOWS,2017-05-14 01:59:00,937,Nice ones.  Very clean looking pike.
1003269,OhioFisherman,2017-05-14 02:12:00,6623,Cool!
1003273,LittleWorm,2017-05-14 02:41:00,122,Nice fish. It's great that you are showing your son how to fish and spend time with him. The best memories of my childhood I have is my dad teaching me how to fish and hunt.
1003280,Rizzo,2017-05-14 03:12:00,4754,2 questions...Severn Falls? and how is Princie? still treating you right I hope? (oops I suppose that is three questions)
1003294,spincast,2017-05-14 11:36:00,3279,any day on the water with the kids is a good day - catching fish seals it.
1003308,Hank Jr,2017-05-14 13:14:00,146,Nice report great getting out with the kids the smiles says it all
1003358,kickingfrog,2017-05-14 19:16:00,8333,"2 questions...Severn Falls? and how is Princie? still treating you right I hope? (oops I suppose that is three questions)   I'll only answer two.  First time ever it didn't start properly. I guess I didn't reattach the fuel line to the motor when I cleaned up the engine after starting it in the driveway a few weeks ago. User error, only delayed at the dock for a few minutes. My son had no issues fishing from the dock if it didn't work out.  I'm afraid I'm going to miss her if I ever move on to another."
1003359,misfish,2017-05-14 19:24:00,29133,Awesome Rob.
1003409,Rizzo,2017-05-15 02:28:00,4754, I'm afraid I'm going to miss her if I ever move on to another.  I guess that's where I am at...although I am very happy with my current boat as well. Kinda like when you have a new girlfriend....you may think of the other one from time to time
