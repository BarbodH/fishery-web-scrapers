1003168,kickingfrog,2017-05-13 02:16:00,8333,Thanks Wayne.  Forgot the box calls at home. Thankfully my brother had a mouth call in his pocket.   Edit to add: My brother figures that old mouth call he had in his pocket was about 25 years old. He bought it at the turkey course he took in the early '90's.
1003170,irishfield,2017-05-13 02:21:00,26272,What's that photobombing behind you?? Is that my pet Mallard or another Turkey.. LOL
1003174,Weeds,2017-05-13 03:40:00,782,I'm thinking unrealistic looking decoy perhaps?
1003177,LittleWorm,2017-05-13 04:48:00,122,And here I was thinking Irish Turkey was code for a bottle of scotch!
1003180,Old Ironmaker,2017-05-13 10:42:00,8243,Which is the Turkey? Seriously nice bird there. I have been hearing plenty of gun shots this week close by.
1003181,Canuck,2017-05-13 10:48:00,491,Was driving around Tiny Twp last weekend a bit and saw a lot of turkeys.  Quite the population come back over the last few years. Good to see.  Maybe I'll dust off the 12 guage again some time.  What are they like to eat around Simcoe County? (assuming you are not strictly a C&R guy   )
1003183,Old Ironmaker,2017-05-13 10:56:00,8243,"Buddy was telling me what the cost of a tag is now for a bird, WOWZA!! I think the last time I had a gun in my hand it was 5 bucks."

1003221,Sinker,2017-05-13 18:20:00,8692,Cool. Nice Jake. Congrats. They are the best eating!  S.
1003222,Terry,2017-05-13 18:23:00,14456,nice
1003377,misfish,2017-05-14 21:42:00,29133,Well done Rob.

(assuming you are not strictly a C&R guy   )   I've only eaten ones from here (except for a southern ON bird that was smoked, and delicious) so I can't say. For me they taste like a turkey but with more turkey taste if that makes sense."
1003398,kickingfrog,2017-05-15 01:18:00,8333,"Cool. Nice Jake. Congrats. They are the best eating!  S.  Ruffed grouse is my favourite meat period, but turkey is real good."
1003405,manitoubass2,2017-05-15 01:53:00,11391,"Yep grouse over turkey for sho,  Nice bird though Rob!!!"
1003570,kickingfrog,2017-05-16 01:02:00,8333,My brother went solo today (and didn't have me to forget the box calls). Took him a little longer but he had his choice of 2 bigger jakes and dropped a 20lber.  
1003572,irishfield,2017-05-16 01:08:00,26272,"If they'd sell two tags at a time, he could have hit another. George.. George.. did you trip... are  you alright. Jim shot the bird, I walked out of the hangar and the other Jake was still staring at his buddy! Good size Tom... about an 8"" beard."
1003574,Old Ironmaker,2017-05-16 01:15:00,8243,"LW, you are going to fit right in here."
1003589,kickingfrog,2017-05-16 01:51:00,8333,"My brother in law has not had the luck of the Irish on the land he's been hunting, so I'm trying to see if he and I can get together but he's shift working and timing it a lot tougher."
1003590,irishfield,2017-05-16 01:57:00,26272,"Okay Rob.. you know the rules and as I told Jim just let yourself in and out. Our son that lives right next door knows who's allowed here (he met Jim today), so between him, his wife and the yard cameras all is good...we're hopefully gone North for the Summer by Thur AM."
1003594,OhioFisherman,2017-05-16 02:08:00,6623,"LOL, that picture had me confused Wayne, the scenery looked more like here than as far north as Temagami."
1003597,irishfield,2017-05-16 02:42:00,26272,It's Penetang.... We go North to Temagami..
1003607,OhioFisherman,2017-05-16 03:21:00,6623,"Thank you sir, I sort of guessed that once I noticed the dual locations, nice place!"
