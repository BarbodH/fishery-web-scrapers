250304,chickenhawk,2008-09-16 21:43:00,612,i found this site through word of mouth......first my cousin on the old message board and i gave it up for a couple years and got back into it again last year when it was mentioned to me by DMASSE....anyways sure am glad that i got back into it......  Hawk
250422,John,2008-09-17 03:28:00,2956, There are many John......some actually apply..
249653,Daplumma,2008-09-15 00:34:00,1961,I was looking for info on fishing the upper French many moons ago.Thought it was strange that a big old hairy lawyer from Pittsburg was helpful on a Canadian board.I cant tell you how much fun this place has been over the years.I have been lucky enough to share a wobbly pop and fish stories with a bunch here in person. Joe
249656,Rich,2008-09-15 00:40:00,3927,"I haven't got a clue how I found this place. I think it was through the profile of a member on another board. I found this place, was given a warm welcome and have called it home ever since!"
249702,John Bacon,2008-09-15 02:07:00,3277,"I found it trough a line on the What's Biting in Toronto aka ""Zoo Board"" during its heyday back in 1999."
249704,douG,2008-09-15 02:17:00,2693,"I googled Ontario Fishing in 2001, was thoroughly entranced by Canadave, Mahumba and a few others.  Members come and go, but some of the best stick around.  I've prolly met and fished with a hundred great folks, and call them friends.  Even the short furry one."
249709,Hooked,2008-09-15 02:27:00,891,"Easy for me, it was the summer of 2004, August to be exact, I was on my back deck, my leg in a cast after Achilles tendon surgery, and my wifes friend Julie was there too.  She called her neighbour Spiel to find out what site he belongs too and he mentioned this site.  I had checked it out prior to Spiel mentioning it, and thought, man, they talk alot non-fishing stuff, haha.  Well, I checked it out again and never left.  I think the one thing that really got me was that I posted about Banjo Minnows early in my posting day here, next thing I know, some guy from Pittsburg (Marty) and another guy from Sturgeon Falls (TJ) are sending me Banjo Minnows free O charge!  Now thats class!  And yes, I have caught fish off them too!  I still gotta get that pic of Sheriff to prove it!"
249765,Headhunter,2008-09-15 12:59:00,5703,"I found this place by clicking a link from Superdad's post on the Quinte site. I watched and did not post for a while, got the gears when I did and eventually found my place here. Met up with Fishnsled at a Ashbridges GTG, thanks Fishheadrick! Now include him as one of my friends and have met numerous folks since! A special thanks to Gerritt, for , well, being Gerritt! His kindness has been humbling and he to, has introduced me to some great folks! I have hung around though, mainly because of a rumour about a man in a Tutu! HH"

So I went down to O.P. one day at lunch with no intention of fishing and found a dead pike.  The next day I go back and Lucid, FishheadRic and Highdrifter show up.  Ric tells me about this site.  I told him I've never bothered with any kind of sites (Thought only losers and geeks used them   )  I believe that was early March 2005.  To my amazement, Fidel proceeded to put on a few extra layers of clothes and jumps into the water in his float tube!  To the annoyance of everyone,  I decided to join."
249788,Reef Runner,2008-09-15 13:40:00,980,"I heard about it from addy79 who was already a member of the board. I never really was a computer or discussion board type, so I lurked for about a month just beacuse my friends dont fish or converse on the topic..found some very interesting reads and quite the cast of characters. This is the only webboard I'm a part of. I believe I joined when I came across the Fishing for Tyler event and auction.  The charity and goodwill of the members here inspired me to become part of this community, and I glad I did!"

It was pretty wild and woolly at that time and I got beaten up pretty badly by one or two (former) members. I was about ready to tuck my tail between my legs and tell myself that I didn't need the abuse. Well Roy, douG and a couple of others encouraged me to stick around for a while and take my lumps like a man. I did and learned to like the abuse........"

When i got back from my trip, i typed ""ontario musky"" into google, clicked ""search images"" and came across this pic of some dude holding what looked to be a 50"" + musky...    I noticed that the pick came from this site...  http://www.fishingontario.net/  Then i clicked on the message board link at the bottom of the page and started searching for and reading all of Lew's musky posts.  I lurked for several months, then finally decided to join.  The rest is history as they say.  Thanks Lew!!  Cheers,  FOTB "
249496,bigugli,2008-09-14 17:43:00,6138,Highway #69 is the center of the fishing universe   From the Waubushene flats right up to the waters of Nippissing and the French.
249497,kemper,2008-09-14 17:47:00,2232,"I think I was 12 and was on the Fishin Canada site and there was NO traffic and I saw a post that said ""everyone has left here, they are all over at OFC""  So there I was, and there I went and I havent changed since.  The only other board I visit is FF.net and that is not very often."

So Kev gave me a email addy for this TJ fella and TJ gave me a link to his new board. My thread,the first on OFC was called ""I love muskie fishing"".....and the rest was history.  Things took off quickly with new members showing up every day. I especially remember the braided line verses mono discusions with Garry2r's and the constant ribbing of Mikeo of course all in fun... Then Lew showed up and joined us in our line preference discusions as well.... To this day I still prefer mono by the way    Guess I'm just old school.....There were so many people coming on board back then I can't remember half of them..... Over the years there have been many folks come and go including myself but I like many others couldn't help returning to the best darn fishing site in Ontario....OFC Home sweet home  Cheers !!!"

249509,tjsa,2008-09-14 18:44:00,1578,"It was in June of 2003, was surfing Mahumba's board up here in Thunder Bay. I saw a post by DanC there with a link to this site. Only took me a couple of days to sign up. As it turned out, I joined right in the middle of one of the big dust-ups and then had reservations about this place. It all got sorted out in the end. I used to be on walleyecentral and fishhawknet, but haven't been back to either of those places for 4 or 5 yrs.(fishhawk is where I first saw a few Moosebunk reports, sure glad Drew signed up here 3-4 years ago). I do not post nearly as much as I used to, but visit here every morning before work, and after work(no time during work to do so).  I have met about 5 people from this place, TJQ, his better half Monique, and their 2 kids Avery and Jaden. Also Mahumba(Roger) and DanC, and will probably be talking to them next Thursday as there is a mini meet and greet with one of our local board members who is from Ohio who comes up this way maybe twice a year."

One day I picked up a brain STD.  I didn't know which site was the culprit.  Turns out neither, but I had to do a background check on them, and found out there were other sites.  This was one of them.  I came here.  Thanks to this site and many others I am now a site easy one who has received many treatments for online brain STD's.  I don't plan on seeking any help, I'm not really a one site kind of guy."

I was planning a trip to Ontario, like a break in trip for my kids, some place fairly close, but with some character, Moon River which I had passed over many times came to mind, started looking for info and found this site.  Illness may have kept me from a Moon landing, but OFC is still number 1."
