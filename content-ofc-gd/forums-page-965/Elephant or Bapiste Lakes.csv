249998,B Diddy,2008-09-16 00:11:00,33,Hi all......early in November I'm heading up to a cottage nearby these lakes for a boys weekend.  Does anyone have any info on these lakes to make for a successful trip?  Or any other lakes that you may recommend in the Bancroft area.  Spiecies of fish doesn't matter...just needs to be in season.  Would musky still be open??  Bill

We used to hold our annual boys musky weekend at Elephant lake, until 2002, when we caught nothing but pike. From 1991 to 2001 we never caught a pike in Elephant, only musky and big bass. Texas rigged plastics and spinnerbaits are best for getting through the weeds to the fish."
250112,B Diddy,2008-09-16 10:43:00,33,Thanks  Are pike & musky still open early to mid november??  I think we're going the 1st or 2nd weekend of the month.  Bill

250158,Reef Runner,2008-09-16 13:08:00,980,Musky and bass should be open.  I was just up at the area not too long ago.  The locals swear by frogs up there.  I was using yum dingers in a frog pattern and did ok on bass.  It wasn't on either lake you describe but in close proximity.  Good luck!
