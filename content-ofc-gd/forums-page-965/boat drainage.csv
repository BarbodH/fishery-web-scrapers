249543,forrest,2008-09-14 20:46:00,1032,"I have a 2007 Lund ssv.....my current beef is the way the water drains (or does not drain) from it:  The front of the trailer is elevated so much the license plate is 1"" off of the ground and the water still sits in it!  The drainage holes require water to be  a certain level before water goes through from front to back and I do not know how much water is sitting in the areas of the boat I cannot see.  Having the removable floors helps prevent the water evaporation....If I am not careful I will have mold problem OR a  leaky boat if I let water freeze in the bottom of it!  IT is kind of hard to see the water in the stern picture...its about an inch worth it is shallower at the drainage plug.  Who knows what water is underneath that section its draining from.  Are other boats like this?  forrest  "

I took some pieces of 2x8, nailed them together and took idiot saw and made hole in the top one. Before I take the trailer of the van I put this under the trailer jack for more height. Drains the boat completely."
