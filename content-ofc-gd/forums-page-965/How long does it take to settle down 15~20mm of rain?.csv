248149,Guest Fishing For Life,2008-09-10 02:39:00,0,went to check out one of the eastern trib today and hard to believe it was full blown because of little rain we had last night ...  checked out the weather forecast ... it is calling 15~20mm rain ... what the BEEP?  I have learnt and have experienced that catching trout in murky water is nearly impossible what about salmon?  how long will it take to water to cool down?
248167,Wild,2008-09-10 03:08:00,704,Only about a day or two for the water to clear but the whole weekend has rain in the forcast so far.

248213,ccmtcanada,2008-09-10 11:56:00,7971,"Different tributaries will clear at different times even if their watersheds experience the same amount of rain.  Tribs with a large watershed will take longer than ones with smaller ones as it takes longer for the water to 'drain' into the flow, and thus clear up.  It also depends on how fast the water is moving.  There is no single answer to this question, except to head out and observe how different creeks/rivers react to rain."
248218,super dave,2008-09-10 12:21:00,323,Cliff is right.  But don't be afraid to go out and fish during moderate flood conditions.  The fishing can be outstanding with very little people.  Just drift anywhere where the flow is slower than the main flow.  Just be careful not to fall in.
250077,hurraylien,2008-09-16 03:52:00,95,while fishing dirty water is definatley tougher super dave is right fish slower water and usually closer to shore i have had some great times fishing the choclate also use lighter colours for roe bags like white and bigger size. fish have acute sniffers and can smell bait from a fair distance i still caught fish today on worms and visibility wasnt to great mind you they werent trout but if the shiners smelt it iam sure the trout could too

250124,Bob,2008-09-16 11:18:00,370,Best time in the world to fish browns.  Hint: they'll be looking for worms and other terrestrials that have been washed into the stream and they'll absolutely gorge themselves.
250214,kemper,2008-09-16 16:35:00,2232,"Think BIG in dirty water.  When the water gets 'too muddy to fish' I bring out my hand tied goliath jigs, they somewhat resemble a drowned bright pink or orange mouse in size. BRIGHT colours and BIG size, you have to remember that the fish in these river systems are big predatory fish and will not hesitate to eat other fish that are 6 inches or more in length while in the lake, so they are not scared of a 3 inch jig or a huge roe sack.  Fish the slower water at the inside turn of big pools or toss at the side of the strong current at the top of a pool and let it float down the seamline, the fish will stage right on the current break waiting for food to come to them.  I rarely  go home because of 'blown' conditions, in fact I have had much more success at blown then at gin-clear."
