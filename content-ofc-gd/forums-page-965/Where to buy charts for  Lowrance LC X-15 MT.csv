250000,aniceguy,2008-09-16 00:19:00,1094,your going to be looking for the navionics classic 901 map its the one that the unit reads the chip is designed for the monocromatic screens the chip is no longer avaliable and the current gold ones cant be read by that unit.  Best bet is Ebay sellers
250083,moemoe,2008-09-16 04:14:00,352,"You can still get the classic chips from Navionics, Just talk to any dealer and they should be able to set you up. I got my chip last spring through proctor Marine in Simcoe for something around 115 dollars, Just makle sure that you specify what unit it is for. The classic Chip for lake erie actually includes Lake Ontario to Bowmanville, Lake Erie and Lake St clair, which gives you some more options. Cabelas actually has the Lcx 15 mt units on for $79 but there are sold out... would have been a steal  http://www.cabelas.com/cabelas/en/template...21404-cat601812"
250224,SlowPoke,2008-09-16 16:56:00,2984, The $79 price is actually for the HotMaps chip. The X-15 price is not shown because it's sold out.
250229,linweir,2008-09-16 17:04:00,202,"I have one X15 MT. It has a chip covering all Karwatha lakes, Simcoe/Couch, Lake O, BOQ, and some area of Lake Erie. It's only 16 M though. I wonder if it can be upgraded?"
