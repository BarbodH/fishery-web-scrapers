With Enron, you would have $16.50 left of the original $1,000.00.  With WorldCom, you would have less than $5.00 left.  If you had purchased $1,000.00 of Delta Air Lines stock you would have $49.00 left.  But, if you had purchased $1,000.00 worth of beer one year ago, drank all of it, then turned-in the cans for the aluminum recycling refund, you would have $214.00.  Based on the above information, the best current investment advice is to drink heavily and recycle."
249967,JeffBornFishin,2008-09-15 22:25:00,260,Couldn't agree more.  Especially after the kick in the financial pants in the last couple days.  Seems like every time you regain your losses your dealt another blow.
249968,keram,2008-09-15 22:26:00,585,  I think your numbers (for stocks) are pretty high   Did you include brokerage commision in your calculations ????
