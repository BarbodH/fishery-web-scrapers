Its a pretty isolated place. To own and operate something like that, you have to really like the wilderness, and working your tail off. Rewarding in its own right,. But not for everybody. You can sort of drive there in the summer, but not with a car. It is a gas and lunch stop on the trail catering to ATV's and snowmobiles. Also a B&B type place with hot tub and lounge. I was there for the first time last winter, but lots of friends go that way regularly. The fishing is good, but as with anything, you gotta have time for it."

And Americans just aren't coming up here like they used to. There are several reasons for that. Their economy is poor (just like ours), their dollar is about 30% lower than it was a few years ago compared to ours, and the price of gas is outrageous.  If your friend is willing to bet that these things are going to turn around in the near future, then he might have a steal on his hands. Roll the dice and see what happens I guess. Nobody knows the answer."
