We're launchin the boat at the marina in Mitchelles Bay.... which would be the best spots to hit for a few first timers ?  Thanks for any help

Follow the channel heading south until you hit 8-10 FOW, hand a right turn and start exploring the drop-off while heading west. Keep a close eye out, it can go from 9' to 2' in the blink of an eye. -Brian"

I dont think you will find any clean water maybe one spot but its way down lake for where you will be launching good luck out there.
