250192,TJQ,2008-09-16 15:03:00,7806,Hey!!  Ive misplaced my last issue of Ontario out of doors... I remember seeing an ad in there for a decent gun with a scope... i think it may have been al flarhetys or something..
250203,Wild,2008-09-16 15:50:00,704,I have no Mag T.J. but is it here in the classifieds? http://www.fishontario.com/classifieds/index.jsp?t=6
250216,TJQ,2008-09-16 16:36:00,7806,"Perfect... thats the one... Ive been looking for a nice entry level gun for Monique...  they have a nice Savage 30-06 with scope for $409..  I've read some really good reviews about it compared to the entry level Remington.  I dont have many Savages, but i think ill give it a shot."
250219,kickingfrog,2008-09-16 16:38:00,8333,Do you really want to arm her???
250223,TJQ,2008-09-16 16:54:00,7806,  Its tooo late....  i just feel she deserves a better shot...
250225,kickingfrog,2008-09-16 16:58:00,8333, So a new gun and a bigger target???
250228,TJQ,2008-09-16 17:04:00,7806,I know Ive put on a little weight but geezzzz....

250328,ch312,2008-09-16 23:01:00,1590,"im a member of canadas largest firearms site and the majority say that the scope you get with these combos are complete junk. id say get her a savage model 200 ($309 from wholesale sports). they are well known for being cheap but shooting 3/4"" groups or smaller with factory loads which is very good. then spend $125 on a bushnell banner and you are good to go for around the same price but with a better scope. i own 2 banners and beat the hell outta them and they never lose their zero.  actually, if you are set on that combo it may still be $20 cheaper ordering it from wholesale sports..."
250352,TJQ,2008-09-17 00:19:00,7806,I figured the scope maybe cheap...  we shall see...  I do have an extra bushnell...  I could switch them around...
