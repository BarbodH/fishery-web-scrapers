The wind was blowing 50 mph. I pulled back into the garage, turned on the radio, and discovered that the weather would be bad throughout the day.  I went back into the house, quietly undressed, and slipped back into bed. There I cuddled up to my wife's back, now with a different anticipation, and whispered, 'The weather out there is terrible.'  My loving wife of 20 years replied, 'Can you believe my stupid husband is out fishing in that c ra p?  I still don't know to this day if she was joking, but I've stopped fishing."
