249548,albany_guide,2008-09-14 21:02:00,23,"I was inspired by the thread about the pike with crayfish in its stomach to post a couple pictures from a few years ago.  While I was in school I used to work as a fishing guide on the Albany during my summers.  There was a small First Nation community 20km down river and some members would come up to occasionally net sturgeon, which they would bring back to their community to eat.  I would used to help them empty their nets and clean their fish.  A large pike was once caught in one of these nets, where it unfortunately died.  It was the only pike I ever saw get caught in a sturgeon net.  Anyways, here is a picture of the fish, as well as what was in its stomach (the fillet knife is there for size reference).  As a side note, the fish was eaten.  As a second side note, please don`t hijack this thread and turn it into a 'should they be allowed to net fish' debate.  I'm just sharing a cool pic...that's all!  Enjoy! "

249552,albany_guide,2008-09-14 21:08:00,23,  ...patience my friend....
249556,jwl,2008-09-14 21:15:00,1056,"yahoo, 2 meals in one...that's one fat belly on that pike for the size of it, and seeing the second pic, no wonder"
249561,Rizzo,2008-09-14 21:20:00,4754,wow that was a hungry pike!
249562,GbayGiant,2008-09-14 21:20:00,1780,"Nice little meal there, no wonder she looked so fat in the first pic. I use to have a pic where a guy cleaned a huge pike and found a little Loon in it, can't seem to find it."
249568,glen,2008-09-14 21:41:00,2641,The pike for supper and the sucker for desert.  Thanks for the cool pics.
249784,fishinggeek,2008-09-15 13:28:00,325,Is that a sucker or a whitefish?  My first guess was whitefish but I could very well be wrong.
249789,snag,2008-09-15 13:41:00,1932,Turducken of the sea!
249846,LeXXington,2008-09-15 16:11:00,1928,"Cool pic, thanks for sharing.. Eating sturgeon?? no hijack but did not know you could eat these.. Did you try it ?  Sure that was done for centuries just courious about eating it."
249853,chickenhawk,2008-09-15 16:22:00,612,I remember a while back TJ had pics of a pike that was full of crayfish.....still have that pic TJ???? I mean this was quite a long time ago but hey there still is a chance.....  Hawk
249860,MuskieWannabe,2008-09-15 16:44:00,79,we openned up a smallie a few weeks back and it had 9 crayfish in its belly!  The thing only weighed 2 1/2 or 3 lbs!  And she was still feeding because she nailed the lure!
250008,Marko,2008-09-16 00:41:00,854,Here are couple of videos i found on youtube of pike eating another pike and just attacking a lot of different baits. First here is a video of a pike smacking something that looks like a dog toy http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AD2tZu9u5qE...feature=related video of pike eating another pike  Video of a little musky trying to  eating a trout ( I think this video has been around )  and a video of a pike attacking another fish on the line 
250017,holdfast,2008-09-16 01:04:00,1813,"Never heard of eating or netting sturgeon in my lifetime.  Should of never mentioned the Sturgeon.  Now Im curious.  As far as the Pike, witnessed my Buddy catching a 26lb Pike below the Lachine Rapids in Mtl.  When he cleaned it , it had a 3lb Brown trout.  Imagine the St lawrence River."
250120,Bob,2008-09-16 11:02:00,370,"Sturgeon is quite tasty and very non-fishy.  Whenever I get the chance, I attend local powwows where they frequently serve up wild game buffets that often include sturgeon.  In those cases, a piece of sturgeon is the first thing on my plate.  Commercial fishermen count themselves lucky to catch a big hen sturgeon, even though they can damage nets.  The eggs are worth their weight in gold."
250143,Moosebunk,2008-09-16 12:29:00,3970,"Sturgeon netting goes on right outside my door on the river here all summer long.  I have yet to bother trying it.  The idea of it bothers me.  To each their own I guess.    That is one fatty pike off the Albany for sure, looks like a whitey in the belly with that pointy snout.  Looking forward to one day trying that river, wherabouts were you guiding?"
250160,Mary Penny,2008-09-16 13:10:00,5,Just curious...what time of year was this fish netted?  Mary Penny
250196,bigugli,2008-09-16 15:23:00,6138,Commercial fishermen have always caught sturgeon in their nets. In the old days they were laid out on a farm field and plowed in as fertilizer. During the depression folks would wait for the boats  to come in and hope they had caught a few sturgeon in the nets. One fish put a lot of meat on the table. Just because it isn't pretty doesn't mean it don't taste good
250499,albany_guide,2008-09-17 15:01:00,23," I was guiding out of Miminiska Lake, part of the Albany system.  Amazing spot!    If I remember correctly, it was probably around mid June   Agreed.  Sturgeon is actually great tasting fish.  Very firm, light tasting meat."
250512,fishinggeek,2008-09-17 15:56:00,325,I had smoked sturgeon at a Jewish diner and loved it.  I highly recommend it if you come across it on the menu or keep one and want to try your hand at smoking.
