249514,davis181,2008-09-14 19:06:00,2,"Hello recently moved to innisfil , are there any fishing areas near by?"
249518,lew,2008-09-14 19:15:00,12767,Perhaps Lake Simcoe ??  I haven't fished it in decades but lot's of our members are frequent visitors there and someone will be able to help you out.  Welcome to the board
249523,forrest,2008-09-14 19:30:00,1032,"I remember a dam on the main road through innisfil.  Lake Simcoe is OK, but, there has to be better places than that!"
249577,Cudz,2008-09-14 22:10:00,2652,Is Lake Simcoe near Innisfil/Barrie?  Is it hidden? lol Cooks bay is full of Pike.  Big Bay point is good for smallies.  Whitefish and perch throughout the area. good luck.
249609,misfish,2008-09-14 22:59:00,29133,"Yer nutz.LOL  Welcome to the board, and yes there are many places to fish in your area. Simcoe rocks and dont let anyone tell you elsewise. Great ice fishing,but dont ask Lew.LOL"
249627,Rizzo,2008-09-14 23:41:00,4754,"whatever you do, don't fish cooks bay on pike opener unless you are a fan of crowds and shoulder to shoulder fishing...and I'm talking from a boat! There is also Little lake off of Duckworth in Barrie"
249722,camillj,2008-09-15 03:51:00,1988,if you are a fan of hardwater ... just head offshore from innisfil beach park ... about 500 yards ... lakers and whitefish are for the taking there ... but dont tell anyone
249950,davis181,2008-09-15 21:47:00,2,for cook's bay can you fish from Monto-Reno Marina. or do they rent boats only.
249957,bassjnkie,2008-09-15 21:57:00,1101,I am not sure about that particular marina. But most of them won't let you fish. Something about liability.
249997,Governator,2008-09-16 00:10:00,879,"Boat Launches - Lake Simcoe Marina, Innisfil - Innisfil Beach Rd, Innisfil - Free boat launch in Barrie - near main beach  Lake Simcoe Marina In Innisfil, south east corner.  The Marina has boat rentals for Simcoe and the only one around as there is none in Barrie.  They have a boat launch there and a Government dock for shore fishing, but beware there's no parking at the Marina if you are using the Gov Dock.  There is also space for MAYBE 2 cars to park infront of the dock, otherwise you're getting a parking ticket ($30, got one last month).  http://www.lakesimcoemarine.com  There's lots of perch off the end of that dock.  Innisfil Beach Only been there a couple of times to the dock with little success.  You need to go further out in deeper water from that point.  The boat launch seemed very active when I was around, so it's likely free.  Barrie You can fish all around the shoreline except near beaches or the duck pond.  The shoreline near the downtown area has a lot of spots available.  The parking lot is behind Hooters   I believe it's a $1/hr and there's tons of spots to fish from.  You can also fish from a Gov Dock off of Dock Rd.  I've been there many times, I'd say the best dock around for active bites.  Keep in mind it's basically all panfish; perch, rock bass & sunfish - live bait works best.  Little Lake Tiny lake with a lot of pressure on it, you'll see a lot of boats out there on weekends but on a week night it's a great place to hit.  Take 400 to duckworth and go west and you run in to the lake.  There is 2 campgrounds and both have boat rentals and are usually sold out most weekends.  There is also a boat launch at one of the campgrounds, I believe it's $6 to launch.  You'll find a ton of hammer-handle pike & bass there.  Hope that helps.  Cheers, Gov"
250016,Fisherman,2008-09-16 01:03:00,7201,"Innisfil Beach launch is only free to the residents, they get a township pass, they rest of us pay. But, it's got a humungous parking lot, and in winter it' free for all."
