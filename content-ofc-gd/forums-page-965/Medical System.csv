Its a simple step fill out those cards."

Signing the donor card is very important, however making your wishes known to your family is more important as ultimately it will be one of them that has to convey your wishes if something tragic was ever to happen to you.  Not a pleasant conversation to have with your family but one well worth having.  Cheers  Craig"
