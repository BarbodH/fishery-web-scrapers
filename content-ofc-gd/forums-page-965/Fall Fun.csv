Checked out the mature King action, watched the blast off and then headed out to the blue zone.  Kinda slow in the BZ this morning going 4/5 while dodging a treble from a spitting bow.  Here are a couple of pics of lethargic matures from in tight....      Here is a nice bow from the BZ.    Thanks for a good morning Rob!"
