250331,buckster,2008-09-16 23:16:00,530,  Ive been using the 15 ft Raven im9 for about 5 years now.  Great rod and does a great job with both steelies and chinooks........ i picked mine up at tightlines in pickering...... pretty common rod
250384,Guest Fishing For Life,2008-09-17 01:22:00,0,"it is not like I try to horse them in without playing  it has always come down to the point where those salmons decide to head into snags, in which, force me to pull them back by turning them.  I can assure you that if there were lotsa space at spots I fish at, I could have had 90%+ landing rate by simply letting them run"

250250,solopaddler,2008-09-16 18:19:00,8605," Have no idea bud, but they've been around for awhile and are pretty common. Any retailer that carries Raven products could likely order one in pretty quickly."
250270,Canuck2fan,2008-09-16 20:00:00,1444,"Streamside are making some pretty sweet 13.5 float rods for under 100 bucks lifetime warranty too. I don't know if they make shorter ones however, I have seen guys who know what they are doing stop and turn big fish with them using pins or spinning reels. If you are ever at Angler Outfitter's in Woodstock ask Joshlin about them. I just saw a 3pc 17fter but I didn't even look at the price..... tv blew up last week and Nascar ain't over yet so.... there will go part of this falls fishing equipment budget LOL."
