863602,tb4me,2014-07-17 20:46:00,3295,Man that's a tough one..I would hate to blow a friendship over 180 bucks..What if its just an innocent mistake? Maybe once he picked it up by mistake and not being an avid fisherman just doesn't realize its yours..Was there a combo left at your place recently that's not yours?
863603,davey buoy,2014-07-17 20:54:00,5505,"One thing I have noticed as getting older is I'm not afraid to ask a question.If he is a great friend?,ask or tell him what you think happened. I would in a second.If he gets bent out of shape,you know he may be guilty.I just can't wonder about this kind of thing.If he admits to taking it,It's all over as far as I'm concerned .Personally,no time for that behavior ,again if guilty.What may be next?????????Good luck Don,in whatever route you choose.

863713,BassHunterOttawa,2014-07-18 16:46:00,29,"I think it should be clarified that the sketchy dude was the husband of the long time friend. So is it worth mentioning to your friend that her husband has what appears to be your rod set up ?  I'd let it go and never deal with him again and just stick to her friendship and hopefully she'll understand why you don't want to see her husband. ever.  I'd say that makes a difference, for sure. Doesn't matter as much since you don't know the guy, and you're just doing him a favour taking him and his kid out in the boat - to possibly be stolen from? That's pretty bold, too, to bring it along with him.  There's a saying that if a friend borrows $50 from you, and you never see him again then it was probably worth it."

863770,spincast,2014-07-18 23:16:00,3279,"sometimes, we confuse acquaintances with friends. Sometimes we make assumptions without enough information. You need to find out if that was your rod (question for you - did you notice it was missing before you saw it in this guys hands?) If it was your rod, then he wasn't your friend. If it wasn't your rod, then depending on how you discovered that, he will either be a better bud than before, or a friend no more."
863805,Old Ironmaker,2014-07-19 05:53:00,8243,"If the guy doesn't fish he wouldn't know the difference between a $500.00 saltwater Penn and a 20 buck Zebco. If he does and he stole it he has to be the worst thief around. They steal stuff to sell not to take back and show the guy who he stole it from, think about it.  I don't get the my daughter bought it part.  He may be stupid too and forgot he stole it from you.  I personally would tell him it looks just like the one you misplaced, not was stolen, years ago. Take it, turn the reel over look at it like you are looking for something and say ""yep just like mine, you wouldn't have mixed this up the last time I was with you or one of the kids maybe"". Watch carefully at his reaction.  I was golfing with a lifelong old friend for the first time in years, I saw in his son's bag an old Taylor Made Burner Bubble I paid big for identical to the one I lost. I said where did you get that club Mark? Dad bought it for me Johnny. I was ready to kill someone. For the next 18 holes that's all I did was think of how I was going to beat this guy senseless but not in front of his 14 year old. After golf he said ""I know why your pissed. I told the kid I bought it for him and you know I didn't. Yea because you put the gleep on it. He replied are you smoking stupid stick? You gave it too me the last time I was at your cottage"". Then I remembered I did just that. What if I accused him of stealing it in front of the kid and made a scene. It was bad enough accusing him of stealing my club. a 50 year friendship was never the same afterwards. I'm a jackass. Could it be something similar, tread lightly or just let it go."

Compassion is hard earned . Anger and revenge is wasted energy.  On the bright side I have recently stopped smoking so I have my sights set on something better.  Thank you all. Don.

864368,Wagoneer,2014-07-23 03:55:00,118,Crappy thing is that possession is everything. If he denies it's yours and obviously you can't prove it's not... The law says it's his.
863499,dhickey,2014-07-17 04:52:00,1038,"Last long weekend I went up to the usual spot with life long friends. Go out fishing with the husband of one of my ""life long friends"" and he decides to bring his son. Ok no problem...  His son is fishing with a rod and reel that I couldn't find. I  searched high and low for it.?  To make a long story short. IT'S MY ROD AND REAL......NO QUESTION ...  The rod is a Shimano Clarus  and a good Mitchel reel  180$(rod/reel)  That's the facts. Short version.   So out in the boat I commented on the rod saying that its a good rod for the money. He tells me that they bought it for their daughter???  Here's the kicker. He doesn't own any thing worth more than 60$ rod & reel combined?? His daughter doesn't even like fishing??  180$?  WHAT DO I DO??   I want the reel back...  Could I live without the rod & reel. Sure.  But it's mine and that's what bug's me..  Don."
863500,Kingsalmon,2014-07-17 04:57:00,107,"Steal it back!  Thats what I would do.  They probably wouldnt be able to describe it if it went ""missing""."
863502,glen,2014-07-17 06:26:00,2641,He tells me that they bought it for their daughter??  If your 100% sure it's yours.  So he is confused or a liar.  If confused maybe you can gently help him see that it's your rod. If a liar he will stick to his guns and you ain't getting it back. Plus he will be telling everyone your a tool.  Get it back if you can.  Might as well bring it up with your life long friend. It may ruin your life long friend ship but you don't need that Bull anyway.

863513,woodenboater,2014-07-17 11:37:00,2277,what DanD said. and don't go fishing them them again.  but I'd be tempted to suggest this looks like the combo you thought you lost and see how they react and take that as your lead.

863521,bigmac1984,2014-07-17 12:39:00,193,"Is it possible that someone else stole it from you and he bought it ""second hand""? Maybe do some more digging... If he said he bought it from someone, what I said is a possibility, if he said he bought it from some retailer, then your instinct is likely right.  I don't think stealing it back is the right answer, you become guilty too and for $180 I wouldn't want that hanging over my head, friend or no friend."

863524,kitch,2014-07-17 12:58:00,42,Obviously he doesn't value the friendship much if he is stealing from you.  I'd be asking myself do I need someone around me who steals from me?  I'd be walking away.
863527,lew,2014-07-17 13:10:00,12766,I had a very good friend who stiffed me for $75 one time and even when I asked him about the money he refused to  pay it back which to me is the same as stealing.  I walked away from the friendship and never spoke to or saw him again and figured it was his loss.  Friends don't steal from friends.
863531,bushart,2014-07-17 13:30:00,2628,Tough call....1st and absolute foremost--I would think one must be sure this did indeed happen---absolutely 200% certain---no doubt---otherwise you may not come out of this looking so swell  Me---as I get older I rely more on my wife to jog my memory---Are you sure you did'nt misplace it---I tend to do this occasionally in a hurry  And if it's beyond any doubt he did lift it------why would you wish to associate with someone who would steal from you?  Trust is earned in any relationship----hard to give-----must be maintained
863532,bigcreekdad,2014-07-17 13:40:00,546,"Would your ""friend"" have had access to the rod and reel to enable him to take it? I'm just trying to close the loop on the probability that you are correct in your suspicion.  When I was in college, I used to shoot quite a bit. I had a Browning 12 gauge, a .222 cal Remington 700 with a good Weaver scope, and a lever action Marlin 22. After I married, my wife didn't want the guns in the house (I know, I know....but I was still in love, or a wuss, at the time) so I left them at our old house with my mom. With a career going and kids, I never shot guns again for 20 years. One day, I decided to get them, (screw the old bag). An exhaustive search of my mom's house resulted in no guns. At that time, my mom was in the early stages of Alzheimers so she really couldn't help. I find out later that my mom, thinking the Browning and the Marlin were my deceased brother's guns, gave them to my brother in law some years before. I was very pissed, and my brother in law readily offered to give both back. After cooling off, I took the Marlin for critters at my cabin, and left him the shotgun as I had no interest in duck or pheasant hunting. I also knew I could use it on a hunt if I wanted. A few years later, I am at one of my nephews home to see his new baby, and I look thru his gun rack....lo and behold, there is the Remington 222, with Weaver scope. My Irish blood immediately boiled and I asked where he got this....as it was MY gun. He said he bought it from another of my nephews....the same nephew who I had sold a boat to a few years before. The same nephew who had stopped making payments on the boat due to hard times. However, I later find he sold the boat, never told me, and never made any more payments. So, he had struck again with the Remington. We had a little talk about that, and I recovered some of what was owed. I did not ask my other nephew for the gun back. Hard to believe family and ""Friends"" will act as such.  In any case, if you think your ""friend"" had the access to the rod and reel to take it, then I think you have closed the loop . He is not your friend. Confront him, get the gear back, and turn your back for good."
863534,bushart,2014-07-17 14:04:00,2628,Moral of the story.......Never!!!...Ever!!!....Give up yer guns!!  I could'nt be that much in love
863544,porkpie,2014-07-17 15:09:00,2521,"There is no way short of you having engraved the items, to prove that the rod and reel is yours. If you believe this lifelong friend could steal from you, and did steal from you then move on and don't associate with him.  Accusing him may make waves with other involved friends and cause you more harm than good.  If you really aren't sure, and believe you could be mistaken, then give him a pass and assume that he is ignorant and mistaken, and ended up with your items inadvertently and truly believes they are his. Or maybe he bought them.  Life is short, and $180, while a decent sum, isn't worth going to war over.  Either cut him off or move on from It!"
863548,DOS,2014-07-17 15:22:00,119,"Is it possible that they did purchase a rod and reel combo, and the daughter not really knowing any differently grabbed your rod by mistake one evening and it has just been assumed that is hers?

863553,BassHunterOttawa,2014-07-17 15:35:00,29,"Brutal to hear... If lifelong friend, who is just short cash, you should decide if the friendship is worth more or less than $180... if he actually took it - companies always make more than one - did he know you were missing it? that's the other thing to ask.I'm a straight-up type of person so I would have flat out said ""That's the rod and reel that went missing and I've been searching for"" and the cards would be on the table at that point."

863578,Big Cliff,2014-07-17 18:28:00,6899,"Well, first of all, that sort of thing hurts no matter how it plays out.  I think I would try to resolve it tactfully. I would ask who they purchased it from because yours was stolen and you know this was yours. Tell them you are going to report it to the police and need the information so they can go after the thief and lay charges!  Either they are going to give up the name (if they did in fact buy it from someone in which case they really have not done anything wrong) or they are going to try to bullspit you and you will have your answer.  Life long friendships are a treasure, it would be ashamed to see one ruined if it isn't necessary."
863582,kitch,2014-07-17 19:09:00,42,"I suppose you could ask him where he got it, how much he paid for it etc ( or ask his daughter who should remember being given the rod) and state yours was stolen and you were looking to replace it......watch for a reaction. I know it is ""only"" a fishing rod vs. longtime friendships but the principal of it is that long time friends are just that because we trust and rely on them.  Being the husband of the friend just makes it worse in so many ways though."
863587,cram,2014-07-17 19:39:00,1733,"I wouldn't assume he stole it.  Is there any chance it was just mixed up with his daughter's rod and they didn't know any better?  I have a rod in my garage that isn't mine, and I have no idea who owns it.  I certainly didn't steal it....expect it was left there by a friend after a trip.   I don't use it (assume someone will recognize and claim it one day), but a  kid may not know the difference.Either way, I would do is send him a note or email saying something along the lines of:""I didn't want to mention this in the boat with your son, but I'm 90% sure the rod he was using was one I had misplaced a while ago.  Is there any chance you or your daughter mixed it up with hers?   If you look up that model online you'll find it's likely not the one you bought for $60""."
863588,cram,2014-07-17 19:41:00,1733,"Further, you know your friend. Is he one to steal?  If so, then you can assume that's what happened. But if not, isn't it more likely just a mixup?"
