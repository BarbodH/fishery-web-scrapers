864711,misfish,2014-07-25 20:00:00,29133,"I was looking at how they put the double blades on the large musky baits. I been fooling with the idea of trying it. My brain never stops when I get going on things like this.  So I started off small.  4"" yum tube,  Still have the double hooks. One is close to the body and one acts as a stinger.  A 3/8 oz slip sinker stuffed in the tube.  Added enough beads to get the blades away from the tube so they would spin.   Looking at this bait when done. I can see how I could make a smaller version with micro tubes for pan fish.  Don,t worry HANDLEBARS,  I,m not going into mass production. Although,I might use some of your color combos for personal use...  Any tips you guys can add would be great.  Having fun.  Baby yumyum          B"

864723,Terry,2014-07-25 21:46:00,14456,adding plastic to a bait is like adding bacon to......anything it just makes it better   mmmm       bacon
864772,Raf,2014-07-26 01:53:00,3495,does it spin ok? might need a metal bead just below the blades/clevis'.  nice looking bacon.
864801,misfish,2014-07-26 08:36:00,29133,"does it spin ok? might need a metal bead just below the blades/clevis'.  nice looking bacon.   I,ll know in a couple of hours. Waiting for my fishing partner to wake up.  YUMMY BACON.   Woke up thinking. If I go with trebles,can I still use the snell knot to tie doubles?  See told ya. The brain wont stop.LOL   I,ll gets some under water footage Raf."
864802,Terry,2014-07-26 08:47:00,14456,bacon
864837,misfish,2014-07-26 16:48:00,29133,"Well it works. Had two nice hits on it,but missed them.  "
864838,BillM,2014-07-26 16:50:00,17367,"I'd remove the weight from the tube, it's not running very straight.  Also maybe put a bead between those blades to get a bit more separation."
864839,misfish,2014-07-26 16:58:00,29133,"The blades are together just like the baits I looked at. The weight in the body of the tube is fine. I need to put some beeds in the tube before the weight. Also need to have more beeds before the blades. Thats the only improvements I see,except for using trebles instead of single hooks. This was a real slow troll. I casted this baits for over an hour or more today. It runs straight. The bite was very slow. Even Terry wasnt getting them. LMAO"

864849,misfish,2014-07-26 17:45:00,29133,"Looks good Brian  Thanks Lew.  I,m liking this toying around with homemade baits.  Looking at doing my own spinner baits now for those bait fish you call BASS."

864853,misfish,2014-07-26 17:59:00,29133," I remember the days you were making some pretty nice Suick knock-offs Brian   Ya, those were fun. I gave them to someone on the board years ago."
864883,Gregoire,2014-07-26 21:36:00,1397,I like it. Red October makes a vibe tube with a single blade. The double blades seem like an upgrade.
