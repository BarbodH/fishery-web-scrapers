864408,Handlebarz,2014-07-23 13:08:00,3790,Well yesterday Mikey and I headed out on LSC for some fishing we started off casting for a couple hours I lost one right away and had two other follows Mikey had a few gar pike follow his line but no takers. We switched up to do some trolling and popped this one about 30 min in after the battle and a nice quick release he was ready to head home. Great day out for about 3 hours with my Boy.  http://youtu.be/QxwDYsjRHAE?list=UUcvHTMSDyGr7ABbDFF51nrw

864468,Musky or Specks,2014-07-23 19:08:00,2710,Very nice fish. Is September the best month for casting?
864469,Handlebarz,2014-07-23 19:13:00,3790,"I can't say it's better then August October or November they are all great.  Brian I was shocked when he was standing up fighting it he usually likes to sit for the battle but then again when jade was 9 she landed a 49 1/4"" I wish I had the cameras back then"
864474,davey buoy,2014-07-23 19:24:00,5505,"Great fun for your son!!!,you must be proud!"
864532,spincast,2014-07-24 00:31:00,3279,"nice fish, congrats."
864539,landry,2014-07-24 01:26:00,1005,Nice job Mike. I recognized your boat I thought anyways. Pretty sure I saw you out there casting in the morning. We were the other line boat out in that area. We did well:)
864540,Handlebarz,2014-07-24 01:34:00,3790,Yeah we had fun messing around there then headed around for a boat ride then started some trolling. If he was not with me I would have been there earlier and stayed on the casting program. But that's what you have to do to keep the kids into fishing. I would hate to make him sick of fishing. Glad to hear you did good how hot did it get out there? I know it was already warm when we left.
864547,moxie,2014-07-24 02:26:00,1566,Brings back memories. Congratulations and thanks for sharing.
864559,landry,2014-07-24 04:51:00,1005,I jumped in the lake three times. Lol.
864569,solopaddler,2014-07-24 11:54:00,8605,Heckuva fish!
864650,Handlebarz,2014-07-24 23:51:00,3790,It was warm enough for a good swim and I would think that most should have gone in if they were out for the day.
