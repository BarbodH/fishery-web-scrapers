863754,spincast,2014-07-18 21:36:00,3279,"Out of curiousity how far of a run is it from the resort to the delta and how careful do you have to be rock wise during that run? Depending on the rain, you can get anywhere from a small branch to a whole tree down the river, but there are no rocks, and its up to 22ft deep down the center of the channel.  There's a couple deadheads at the delta (run between 'em unless your fishing the cabbage / pencil reeds), and river channel does end fast - from about 17 to 3 foot in no time at all - but it stays around there so long as you stick to the middle.  The skeg killers - if you are close enough to  cast into 3 foot of water, be aware. Most of the points run well out into the lake, some boulders off the points will give you a big ""OOOOOHHHHHHHH poooooooooop"" if you aren't watching"
863767,Musky or Specks,2014-07-18 23:02:00,2710,Thanks guys we just booked for Aug22 - Aug 29 of next year. If anyone has been there @ that time please let me know any info!!!!
864024,Moosebunk,2014-07-20 22:39:00,3970,"Onaman's is one great place now matter how or what you wanna fish for.  Specks are a trickier start that end of the lake but the eyes and pike are plentiful.  You get a laker, expect it be a tank.  Thoroughly enjoyed this and any report that comes off that lake.  Good fishing guys, thanks for posting."

863545,Rod Caster,2014-07-17 15:10:00,5784,"I’ve driven by the Nipigon River many times in my career. Caught some good fish at the bridge and always praised that waterway as a special destination worthy of any outdoorsman’s/woman’s time. Beyond the bridge, I really knew little else of the water or the area although a dimly-lit light of desire always shone in my brain. The Nipigon reports on OFC made me chuckle in envy. Enter May 2014; after several open invitations from Spincast (Rick) to fish with him on Lake O for some mighty fish he sends me a PM. He needed a last-minute participant for an 8 day trip to Onoman River Resort; a place he had visited last year as well. My exact responding words were “ I don’t know how this physically happened, but I think my tail just wagged”. I’m entering a new and busy phase in my life; new baby and still in my first year of owning an acreage. What would otherwise be a very easy decision turned out not, both at first and throughout the week as I had very little contact with my nursing wife.  I must have the best wife ever because she was not reluctant to let me go, she must have read the Nipigon OFC reports as well  Rick referred to her as “super Mom”, and I think he’s not far off.  We meet for the first time at my house and leave at 7pm on  Friday July 4th, stopping in Matheson for a night of rest. Bright and early we resumed our destination.    This gave Rick and I good time to meet and talk about things. Rick is a hard-working family man with a positive and level view on life. Much enjoyed talking to him about the ways of the world and the lessons we learn. By around 4pm, we met with Linda and Kevin then we launched and headed straight for the water. Rick wasn’t messing around. He wanted to fish. I was ok with that; I think he knew what was next.  We initiate for pike. Follow the contours of the delta that forms the Onoman River/Nipigon confluence. Weeds are sparse compared to last year (Rick was there later in season last year). We both leave the gate with energy, casting all over the place as if there was an exploded bomb on the boat and our lures were shrapnel. A quiet surprise hangs over us as we get but a couple hammer handles. We approach a ‘walleye’ hole, I switch to grubs and Rick continues casting to shore. He gets bit. He gets bit hard and heavy. Not much of a fight as this old girl has had better days, but none-the-less she’s worthy! Rick gets his 40”+ with a 42” FATTY! This may be the thickest pike I’ve ever seen.          We continue for pike and walleye and get into a few nice fish that evening. Rick sleeps well knowing that he has 7 days to best his best. The cabins were satisfactory, if not surprisingly well-appointed for the price of admission. There are a lot of things that say ‘work in progress’ on this property and the sides of the cabins represent that. Nothing comes quick unless you’re rich and near supplies/equipment so you can understand that the owner Robert must have a to-do list the size of Rick’s pike. Regardless, I was expecting less, basically prepared to go camping in the bush and was slightly over-geared. The only thing that I would add to the suggestion box, is to install Micro-screens in the cabins. I got destroyed by no-see-ums (those little  buggers) a couple of nights. Micro-screens are kind of a luxury, so I say that tongue-in-cheek, but seriously, I got destroyed and lost some sleep and probably have deet running through my veins now.        Day 2  On the water by 10 we work new shoreline in Humbolt Bay, casting for pike or whatever else wants to bite; in the back of my mind every bite/tug/nibble is a huge speckled trout. Rick and I discuss where and how we’ll find them and given the amount of pike around, I suspected them to be on deep-breaking shorelines. Storms hang over us and in the distance throughout the day. We end up finding spots of heavy activity, finding very aggressive and shallow pike.        In one spot I basically hung my spoon out of the boat to a visible pike, and another pike came swinging in to smash it. Cool! No walleye were to be found anywhere near the shorelines and this pattern was consistent throughout the week. The walleye were likely in a post-spawn mode and the big girls had moved deep.   After hitting an un-counted amount of pike, we decide on a short troll to Hitchcock Islands for lakers followed by some casting for specks to the sharply vertical rocks that surround Hitchcock. We mark some fish, but nothing stirs up. At around 8pm a good storm rolls in with some cool fog/cloud formations on the lake. We decide to pack-in and journey back.            Day 3  Bad weather. Strong winds and rain. We sip our coffee and eventually hit the water, looking for new spots and trying to find them walleyes. A large shallow flat near the confluence of the river is the target of worm harness, shallow running body baits and flutter spoons. The weeds were just starting to develop and it really looked like prime walleye water, but nothing shows, well, short of a few smallish pike. We journey-on and play in some new areas, testing water, but it’s really quiet out there. Not much we could do considering that anything outside of island shelter was blown-up. After killing several hours we return to the ‘delta’ to fish the fresh weeds. Right away, we start hooking into some good pike. Rick does a great job of manoeuvring the boat and I develop of wolf-like-intuition and just hammer fish after fish; good sized ones too. My biggest being 41” (a few just shy of 41”), with an average of 30-32”. Seriously, my sins were forgiven, I could do no wrong, the planets aligned; pretty much every 3-5 minutes I had a good strike. A 3” red/white Williams Wobbler was my main bait. Rick puts in a good effort, but can’t keep up. I even land a 28” walleye from 3’ of water. I’m red hot like the Wobbler itself. This would be ‘my day’.        Back at the cabin, I get a few minutes of wireless internet and made contact with the wife. Felt good to confirm that things were alright at home.  Day 4  I’m hungover. Not from alcohol, but from catching so many pike. My arms are sore, my legs heavy… yes, yes, suck it up buttercup. It was a cool and calm morning and we start off at the ‘delta’ again. Almost immediately Rick pokes into a huge fish. With rod down and a sign of things to come for the day, I grab the net. “It’s huge Rick, It’s huge”. 42” of northern water wolf enterers and breaks his net. We land it anyway and sew up the mesh. As I’m looking for more big walleye in the shallows, Rick proceeds to catch 4 pike over 40”!! If yesterday was my day, this was Rick’s. Wow! We didn’t bring proper measuring tools (used fishing line lengths and brought them back to camp at the end of the day to measure), and I think the biggest we measured was 43”, but I’m quite sure the one fish was closer to 45”+ on a proper tape.          Things settle down and we prepare a shore lunch of pike. A moose was eating emergent weeds from the shallows which added another dimension of interest to the trip.      At this point, I’m getting antsy to see some trout. I don’t go to Nipigon to not catch trout.  In my mind, I’ve missed several speckled trout bites, in reality they were all pike. The winds are still strong, so we decided to chase lakers instead of manoeuvring the boat close to the rocks. Rick’s home waters are some of the best laker waters around and they compete with Rainbows and Salmon, so his enthusiasm for lakers is not matched to mine…understandably. Being the nice guy he is, he gives me a lesson on down-rigging and we give it a shot anyway. At this point I haven’t told Rick that I have a Lake Trout curse attached to my person.  The curse proves to be alive and well, not just today, but throughout the trip.   After marking lots of fish but teasing none, we head in to the river were the walleye fishing is nearly always on fire. We catch dinner (mostly Rick) and head in for the night. After some talks, we agree on a trooty day tomorrow since the weather is improving. This guy sleeps well knowing that.    Day 5  Morning is cool, mind is sharp, coffee is delicious! We jet to specky-y water.    I cast from the bow and Rick trolls. This type of big-lake speck fishing is unique and not for the faint of heart. Nipigon is loaded with boulders that can show up quickly. I do my best to watch the waters and I’m glad to say that no damage was done to Rick’s beautiful  Starcraft this trip.   I’m focused. My inner wolf returns. I’m casting with a scary amount of accuracy and energy (made me laugh just typing that). A few pike piss me off, but Mr. Troot eventually takes! It was a dramatic fight as he pulls under the boat and near the motor with power I would never have expected from a speck. My eyes nearly requiring socket re-entry surgery as I’m asking Rick to get the net ... it’s in. WOO F’N HOO!!!! I swear, scream, fist pump, dance like a fool, make Rick laugh and basically don’t stop. What is easily my biggest speckled trout to date is a 24” beaut from beaut!       We continue fishing for specks until mid-day approaches then we switch to lakers. Again, my curse kicks-in, all we do is mark tonnes of fish and bait-balls. After the deep-water trolling we return to specks but nothing will take. Kind of disappointing but the word around the camp is that it’s been a hard bite; regardless, I’m happy as all hell. Also got a few nice pike.    We finish things off at the delta and the river. Lots of small pickerel to be found and we have a good fish dinner.     Day 6  It was a slow start for all. I actually stayed behind today to go laker fishing with Robert the resort owner. We got along pretty good; he had a free day to fish without clients and wanted to just have a day to himself to fish. I was more than happy to provide some company/conversation while I get the inside scoop on how to find/fish lakers on Nipigon in his nice big boat. I got some great information from Robert including lots of history of the area and lots of discussions about wildlife. He was a great guy to hang with, even though I may have passed on my Laker curse….sorry Rob, good luck shaking that off.  I can’t believe we didn’t get a single bite over 5-6 hours of prime laker water, but it was still a great opportunity and I appreciated the chance to fish with him.    We exchanged stories upon our return. Rick missed a couple specks and caught some good pike. Again, the walleye were tight-lipped for everyone.      http://i973.photobucket.com/albums/ae214/spincast/2014/Nipigon%202014/DSCF2832_zpsf8a0e16a.jpg[/img][/url]    Day 7  Last day. We got up early and put in our best final efforts. It was a calm morning, but the weather was forecasted to turn nasty later in the afternoon. Because of the weather we stay fairly close to the river and gave one last shot at finding pickerel. We tried a bit deeper, but the sheltered areas were no deeper than 17 feet of water; I was looking for 20-30. The clouds and wind rolled in, so finding the deep structure and outcroppings on a dangerous lake like Nipigon wasn’t much of an option.   We sidled into another nearby river thinking there may be pickerel, but it was slack water and only a few pike were hanging out. As we crept upstream we saw a cool commercial fishing boat. Good luck getting that back in the water boys.   The rain started and the wind really picked up so we made our escape in what were the worst waves of the trip. Being primarily a canoe guy, I don’t much venture into harsh waters, so I was a bit nervous at the return trip, especially when Rick’s Oil Pressure light came on. Turns out it was just an oil change warning, but I was hanging on tightly to my seat the whole way back.   Back at camp, we packed up and prepared for an early morning drive.  Day 8  5:30, we are up and basically ready to leave. 6:30 we hit the road and drive straight to North Bay, splitting the drive. This was easily my best fishing trip; the experience itself as much as the fishing. I have no immediate plans to return to Nipigon, but when I do, I’ll return to Onoman. It suited my style of trip and Robert’s location is perfect… really, other than a fly-in lake, I can’t imagine a better location to operate a resort.     It was nice to meet Linda and Kevin. Those two fished hard out of a smaller boat. They really are hardcore.  Rick deserves big thanks for organizing and being the captain!! He had an extra 5hrs of driving after North Bay, he must have been tired after this trip…. [url=http://s944.photobucket.com/user/guertin/media/IMG_20140712_151917_zpse20fd91e.jpg.html]"

Not tagging the walleye or Lakers this time just gives you one more reason to head back  Each of us had a day when we were the fish machine, our lines blessed by the lady of the great lake. The beauty and power of this lake touch the soul.  here's a few more choice shots                    we'll break that Laker curse when your ready to ply the waters of the Big O in a year or two when Super Mom and Abbey can  share the fun."

863686,Rod Caster,2014-07-18 13:29:00,5784,"The river run is 4.5miles. Rocks no issue, but loose lumber/branches need to be watched for. As Rick said, this run gets boring after a week, although it's fun to watch the eagles/hawks  Rocks were mostly a concern when we fished within 30-50 m of any shoreline. Points and skree rock would jut out in a hurry."
863687,Rod Caster,2014-07-18 13:30:00,5784,"Glad everyone enjoyed the post. Thanks for posting some of Linda's photos, Rick. i didn't have a link to her photos and we never exchanged them at the cabin. She took some awesome photos that week!"
