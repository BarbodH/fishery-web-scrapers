Prior to this I was running the 1.8 version that came pre installed with no issues.I have the Navionics Gold card and now after loading the 4.0 update the Nav charts load very slow when zooming in and eventually freeze the unit, at the same time some of overlay data disappears almost as if the unit is rebooting. When I switch from the Nav card over to the Lowrance mapping everything seems to function normally. I did not have the unit on the water, just loaded it in the garage.Is it possible I should have loaded the previous updates 1st, 2.0, 3.0 prior to the 4.0?Any help would be appreciated. Thanks"
