862304,Handlebarz,2014-07-09 09:42:00,3790,Dang here I thought I would see pics lol looking forward the them. I have not boated any big fish yet but have had the chance just no commitment on their part.
862358,Fisherpete,2014-07-09 18:45:00,1814,"Ok, ok... I'll get the post up tonight lol... The pics of my biggest fish so far will be added after the weekend, John's camera is at his cottage haha!"
862465,Fisherpete,2014-07-10 01:28:00,1814,"So.  My season started off... horribly.  Opening weekend on the tri-lakes - 20+ hours on the water... one follow was all I managed. At least it was a big fish, but that was little consolation for a lot of effort. At least the boys got into a few - Andrew landed the best of opening weekend at 43.75"".          Matt with a couple smaller ones      Andrew with another just before dark    Through the rest of June, Scott and Josh put a few nice fish in the boat as well...            My next two outings were short evening fishes, the first time I hooked into a solid fish - only to lose her at boatside. In the 43-44"" range. The second time was a skunking.  Next time out - 9 hours on the water - finally put one in the boat - a runt that barely pushed 30 inches. Five trips so far, and not feeling very good about my muskie mojo...  June 30th. Fisherpete gets his groove back. Out for a morning fish with Andrew, the two of us go 5/10. Andrew hooked into six fish, but only managed to land two, both low 30's. Just one of those days where they didn't want to stay pinned. One of the lost fish was a good one too. I managed to go 3/4. First thing in the morning hooked into a mid 30's fish on a Handlebarz, she jumped and shook it. Got my next one trolling, a solid 37"" fish that fought hard. Now the real fun started... we headed to a casting area and shortly after I had a hot follower, which I led into an excellent figure 8. Once, twice around... hot on the bucktail... three, four - flashes of gold and green below showed she was still there... five, six turns and BAM! The rod loads! A great boatside battle ensued, and soon she was in the net. My first true figure 8 fish - ever! She measured in at a chunky 39.5"". We resumed casting, and five minutes later my Handlebarz was absolutely crushed by a big fish - another great battle which I won. This big mama came in at 44"" and with a nice girth as well. Maybe 5 minutes after that I had another mid-40's fish come in hot on my bucktail again - which was trailing a big wad of cabbage weeds - she did two turns on the 8 and snapped at my lure - and got nothing but a mouthful of salad!!! The fish were certainly aggressive on this day, it was fun. We both had family commitments in the evening, and packed it in just after lunch.  37""    39.5"" on the figure 8    44""        Canada Day was my next time out - this time with Scott. We hit the water around 7:30am, and immediately began raising fish. 13 muskies showed themselves to us in the short time we were out! I hooked into two, both on Handlebarz and landed one, a 35"". Around 11am, the skies opened up, with plenty of thunder and lightening, so we were forced to pack up and head out. Sitting at home that afternoon, the skies now clear, I made a last minute decision to make the drive up solo (Scott had afternoon plans) for a second time and see if any of the fish we raised in the morning were hungry yet. It turned out to be a good call... In the first three hours I was there, I raised seven more fish, and two of them actually blew up on my lures but missed. 8pm rolled around - and the next hour was spectacular. I hooked and landed four muskies, all in spots where we had raised fish in the morning. 35,36,37 and then capped off with a 42"". The 42"" was something special... I was casting to the end of a long weedbed, when the water absolutely exploded around my twin ten. It was the most violent strike - and miss - of my muskie fishing career. I cast right back to the same spot - and another massive explosion - but this time the hooks found there way home. This fish was absolutely savage, and fought the same way. I could have fished another half hour, but I actually felt content with my day of fishing at this point and headed out before total darkness set in. 5/6 with 20+ fish raised and a half dozen bumps/blow-ups - great day in anyone's books!  35"" from the morning    First of 4 landed between 8 and 9pm    Savage 42"" that capped off a great day    This day also broke a streak of 4 consecutive skunkings since I started fishing this lake last year!  Next up - July 3rd - a quick after work fish with John (cowanjo) to show him around one of my favourite lakes - heavy winds made it a tough go, but I managed to get a great fish on a trolling pass - my best so far this year... but the pics and details will have to wait on this one until I get them from John's camera  July 5th - exploring some new waters with Andrew, this time guided by John - crazy windy again, raised a few nice fish but nothing hooked or landed by anyone on this day. No matter, learned some great new spots that I'm sure will produce a big fish at some point, and picked up a few pointers from John that would pay off the very next day...  July 6th - after getting caught up around the house, decided to do another evening fish. On the water around 5pm. Immediately raised a good fish, then nothing for a few hours. Around 7pm, hooked into a solid fish - around 40"" - which I lost at boatside. A few casts later, I hooked into a heavy fish - which fought hard and gave me a hard time netting by myself. The first glance I had at her my heart went into my throat - it was a tiger, and a really big one! What a beautiful fish, with just ridiculous girth and a massive head. She measured in at 43.5"", a new personal best for me (previous was 41""). It may even be the same fish - it was caught at the exact same waypoint two years ago -  haven't compared the pics yet to confirm. Either way, I was pumped! Tigers may just be the most beautiful freshwater fish out there, and with all the best predatory attributes of both pike and muskies, they are truly at the top of the food chain. It is my 13th tiger overall.      That's all for now... I'll update the post after getting the pics from John.  Teaser for later this month - Andrew and I are returning to LOTW...  Esoxfully yours, Pete  Here's a couple more from the past few weeks...  Josh with a nice one    Andrew with a girthy beauty - 43"" no tail pinch      And my best so far this season, 44.25"" no tail pinch. Good girth too.        The boys have a few more beauties that I will post once they send them.  Andrew and I leave tomorrow for LOTW... stay tuned Esox fans!  Pete"
