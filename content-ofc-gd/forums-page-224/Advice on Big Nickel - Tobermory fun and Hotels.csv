I'm not looking for google responses but places you know of or have stayed at.  Also, any advice on taking the Family to the Big Nickel and the Chi-Cheemaun / Tobermory touristy things.  Thanks, Entorpy"

The super8 is nice but a little more expensive. As for tobermory the only place I stayed there was the harbourside hotel. It's right on the water and very nice, but it's not cheap. Hope this helps  Kuha"
