863929,Spiel,2014-07-20 13:30:00,9065,I came across this this morning and figured I'd share the link. I'm not sure these things do help but I signed.  http://www.change.org/en-CA/petitions/city-of-north-bay-ban-nipissing-commercial-fishing-and-net-fishing?recruiter=129968610&utm_campaign=signature_receipt&utm_medium=email&utm_source=share_petition
864035,Nipfisher,2014-07-21 01:06:00,2449,Being led by some members of the band. Awesome.
864050,Steelheadphycho,2014-07-21 02:16:00,470,Thanks for posting. I signed it and sent it to many others to sign.  Really hope this makes a difference!
864099,Rod Caster,2014-07-21 16:44:00,5784,"They are sending to the City of North Bay?? What the heck is the CNB supposed to do? Should it not be sent to the MNR, fisheries Canada or the Province in General, or the Federal Gov?"
864105,BassHunterOttawa,2014-07-21 18:07:00,29,Conservation is key to the future of angling in Ontario.Thanks for posting. I've shared it too
864120,Steelheadphycho,2014-07-21 19:42:00,470,"This is true. What can they do? Regardless, I signed the petition, and I hope others do too. How many users does this forum have? If everyone on it signed it and passed it on to others who are not on the forum, It might have some kind of impact.  I wouldn't hurt anyway......"
