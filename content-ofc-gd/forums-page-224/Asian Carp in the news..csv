863359,OhioFisherman,2014-07-16 12:34:00,6623,"http://www.michigan.gov/dnr/0,4570,7-153-10364_52261_54896-226898--,00.html  "" How did Asian carp get here?Bighead and silver carp were imported into the southeastern United States in the 1970s to remove algae and suspended matter out of catfish farm ponds and waste water treatment ponds. While the exact manner of their release into the wild is still debated, it is widely believed that during large flood events in the mid-1990s some ponds overflowed their banks and Asian carp were released into local waterways in the Mississippi River Basin.""  I am guessing that none has the resources to pay for a problem they created? If it could even be proven that they were responsible?"
