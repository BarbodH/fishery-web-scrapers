864202,Steve,2014-07-22 13:31:00,2075,"Crap, another agreement with Bill .... I'm digging myself deeper by the day  I use braid on my poppers.  It help with hook sets when ""long distance"" casting.  Flouro sinks and doesn't provide any benefit to top waters...  Mono .... well, mono simply sucks, lol."
864206,BillM,2014-07-22 13:49:00,17367,"Steve, lol!    I also use tiny XXXS barrel swivels (From my steelhead fishing) to attach a mono leader and a small snap. (Usually 20lb Big Game or XT, nothing fancy).  Doesn't pull down the mono so the lure doesn't end up diving under."
864207,fishnsled,2014-07-22 13:56:00,3520,I started using the regular PP years ago and have never had a reason to try anything else as it does exactly what I want it to do.   Me as well.  I've found that I use to be jumping on the new line band wagon in the past only to be disappointed in the product and tearing off the reels. (Wasted so much money on some of that crap.) These days I stick to what has been working over the years and that is all.  Mixed reviews on the slick so I'll stick with the original.
864298,davey buoy,2014-07-22 22:02:00,5505,"Been using 8/30 moss green PP on two baitcasters,and one spinning reel now for a couple years and longer on others.No reason to change for me,no issues at all.Super Slick will have to wait for now.These reports may save me some money.lol."
864310,MCTFisher9120,2014-07-22 23:02:00,3761,"@Billm lol.  Dude you don't use braided line for topwater applications.  The reason your having trouble with the stuff is because you need to learn how to and when to use it. Braid is excellent for topwater…maybe for Spook style baits it's not ideal but I use 12lb Sunline SX1 Braid exclusively for 1/4oz 2"" Poppers…The distance I get is impeccable, maybe it's the way the NRX802S loads up I don't know. Only issue with braid and top waters are if you throw braid that's too thin the line will catch on the treble hooks on a few casts each morning. I don't do it because of my confidence with the line, lure, and rod however it is a time kill once in a while. I also hate a knot that bumps guides in any rod. The solution is to add a 2-3ft chunk of 12lb-20lb Mono, the stiffer mono stops the hang-ups. I still prefer straight braid, as others said your hook set what that bait goes under is important and that no stretch helps.  Slop Frogs and Topwater are part of the same club and for this if your not using Braid your not catching 95% of your bites in the slop…I guarantee it  For the PowerPro, I would always suggest the Spectra Braid vs the Super Slick. Before I found Sunline SX1 and FX2, and there Fluorocarbons MossGreen PowerPro ruled. The SX1 is just a tighter, longer lasting braid. From 12lb to 40lb I've had nothing but success. Read up  MTBF"
864312,solopaddler,2014-07-22 23:11:00,8605,I would probably like the super slick if it wasn't so prone to abrasion and breakage (much like nanofil imo). Yes it casts further but after several failed tries it's regular power pro for me.  I suppose if all you ever used it for was topwater applications it might be okay...
864325,mattaw,2014-07-22 23:56:00,162,"I use a lot of super slick, and some reglar PP too. For my the superslick is my mainline for a lot of what I'm throwing. I have never had an issue with breakage and just like how it casts and feels when I fish it. But hey, each to their own right?"
864341,Lunatic,2014-07-23 01:50:00,536,@Billm lol.  Dude you don't use braided line for topwater applications.  The reason your having trouble with the stuff is because you need to learn how to and when to use it. 
864354,musky_hunter,2014-07-23 02:55:00,328,"Sunline SX1 and FX2 are the best all around braid line avaialbel. Tough, Super Round, and smoother than all braid except Samurai."

863341,Gregoire,2014-07-16 03:40:00,1397,super slick is horrible stuff
863374,Sinker,2014-07-16 14:10:00,8692,"Nope, I can't stand the super slick either.  S."
863403,manitoubass2,2014-07-16 18:48:00,11391,I had to try it. Waste of $. Took it off the spool after a few outings and in the garbage. Nothing but the original these days. I loved 832 for a year or two but the quality seemed to diminish.
863410,sauce,2014-07-16 19:38:00,219,Guys in the local tackle shop said it was great. I tried 10 lb and didn't like it at all. Back to the original for me. Maybe its better in higher pound test??
863448,BowSlayer101,2014-07-16 23:12:00,296,haven't tried it yet but by the sounds of it i just wasted 20 bucks.....

863453,Lunatic,2014-07-16 23:42:00,536,i have them both and i dont see the problem with the super slick? i like them both.
863458,Dan668,2014-07-17 00:16:00,1120,"I use sunline,  but liked super slick when i was using it."
863460,sofabed,2014-07-17 00:35:00,119,I still have a couple of rods with super slick however all new line is the old PP.
863472,porkpie,2014-07-17 01:31:00,2521,"Original powerpro is relatively inexpensive for braid and works excellent.  No need to change for me.  I did pick up a spool, then put it back and bought the regular, by the sounds of it I'm glad I did!"
863485,Sinker,2014-07-17 02:44:00,8692,"I find the slick tangles a lot more, and is harder to untangle. I dont like the colour of it either, the old PP is harder to see in the water. I have one reel spooled with the sslick, and I hardly use it because of the line.  S."
863495,ONbuckhunter,2014-07-17 03:31:00,39,I really like it.  I use both the original and super slick and I like the super slick more.  I actually will only use PP as I really don't like the other braids.  I use the super slick from 20-65 lb and it doesn't tangle much at all.  I use pp red for lighter applications on spinners.
864113,bman32,2014-07-21 18:58:00,27,I only use Super Slick for my musky reels. 65 lbs Timber Brown. Never had any problem with it.
864115,BillM,2014-07-21 19:02:00,17367,Almost as bad as Suffix 832.
864117,misfish,2014-07-21 19:25:00,29133,"Almost as bad as Suffix 832.      I spooled my Diawa bait caster last weekend. Nice smooth casting line. If you have your settings right,you shouldnt be having birds nests..   Welcome back Bill."
864152,Lunkerhunter,2014-07-21 23:31:00,455,I hate the super slick much prefer oringal. I also don't mind the suffix 832. I think it casts further than pp but frays a bit more and loses it's color fast
864154,ecmilley,2014-07-21 23:42:00,2163,Super slick can cast a weightless senko a country mile on a chronarch anyway. Have superslick on 3 reels a stradic with 15lb and it outcasts a stella with original power pro. Also have a core with it Works fine but do notice it gets wind knots much easier
864155,BillM,2014-07-21 23:50:00,17367,"     I spooled my Diawa bait caster last weekend. Nice smooth casting line. If you have your settings right,you shouldnt be having birds nests..   Welcome back Bill.  It's not the bedding that sucks, it's the tip wrap...   Way too limp, especially when fishing topwaters.  I'm not the only one that hates it, lol.  Back to normal 20lb PP for me.  Spinning reels get 6lb Nano or 6lb Fireline Crystal.  No complaints about either of those.  Nano casts further then anything I've used (I also use it on the pin as well)"
864161,Steve,2014-07-22 01:01:00,2075,832 frays. strange.  I have used PP since FINS PRT stopped production.  PP has always been great to me.

Nano casts further then anything I've used (I also use it on the pin as well) Yep The tip wrap drove me crazy. Nothing like a big chinook grabbing you lure when you are tip wrapped. It is original power pro for me but even better is the Sufix performance braid. That is if you can find it anymore  Thanks guys you just save me some coin I was just about to try a spool of power pro slick"

The reason your having trouble with the stuff is because you need to learn how to and when to use it.  Wait, you're not one of those guys that still thinks he needs to run mono for topwaters are you?   I've been running braid for topwaters for ages, zero issues...  Except of course when I decided to spool up some Suffix 832, lol.  Brian, I got tip wrap all the time with 832, especially when fishing topwaters.   If you're bombing spinnerbaits you'll most likely be fine with the new PP stuff...  Just make sure you're not wrapped before you cast or that $10 spinnerbait will be donated to the lake bottom  I run 6lb Nano on the pin but be warned, do not use it when fishing below zero temps..  Ice in your guides will rip it to shreds in no time.   If you want to run braid in the winter, try Fireline instead..   Puts up with way more abuse.   The zero stretch of braid combined with the pin makes a deadly combination... Especially for those hero hooksets"
864201,aznphil,2014-07-22 13:31:00,73,"yes pp slick may be more limp / prone to tangle but people have highlighted the advantage in casting range...i noticed i needed to adjust my techniques a little as well / be a little more attentive to line management.  As said the advantage far outweighs its nuisances...for certain techniques...for other applications there may be no difference using slick vs other braid.  I have 10lb, 20lb, sad they don't have anything under 10lb...i instead use 8lb 832 which suffices"
