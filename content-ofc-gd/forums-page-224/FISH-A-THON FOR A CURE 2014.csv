864579,The Urban Fisherman,2014-07-24 13:50:00,2050," Oooops, I didn't see it Ryan, colour me red faced. Thanks for the kind words and I'm quite honestly humbled and proud to be a small part of such a wonderful event.  Cheers to you and all those who help make it happen.  haha No worries bud - I wish you were able to make it out!  Maybe still a chance?  Sent my donation in and sent the donate link around so hopefully a few more will donate.  We received it on our end MOS!!! THANKS so much for the generous donation!  It will certainly add to our tally!  I am so peeed that I can not make it again this year...   I have to try and schedule this better for next year...  We're gonna miss you Loonie!  See you next year?  WHAT! Kelvin, now I am missing my main helper on the ""Q. *sigh* BTW Ryan, do you have big BBQ for me to use? Or do I manage two again this year?  Hey HTHM - Yep, it's certainly bigger then my Q... almost twice the size... The one we had our eyes on was giant, but then we found out it was a wood BBQ which would have been a pain so we're going with plan B which is Susie's BBQ... newer than mine and like I said, pretty much twice as big.

863224,The Urban Fisherman,2014-07-15 18:04:00,2050,"Hey Gang!  First off, it seems as my kids get older and things get busier & more complicated around here I'm not able to get on OFC as much as I'd like!  That said, since day one our Fish-a-Thon for a Cure couldn't happen without the amazing support from everyone on this great forum!  I have to thank everyone from the bottom of my heart for the ongoing support, from our volunteers, to our sponsors and everyone else involved in the event.  This year's event is ONLY A WEEK AND A HALF AWAY!!!! Boy did that ever creep up fast on me! LOL  We have nearly 100 people singed up so far and are receiving prizes from all of our sponsors daily!  I have to send a huge shout out to Laurie from Dixie Dairy Bar and Tackle in St. Thomas who has once again gone way over and above with prize donations!  She's also offered to pledge anyone who walks into the shop looking for one, so make sure to pop in and see her.  We also have a bunch of other stuff rolling in from various companies and members of OFC who have offered to help out with our cause.  We'll be posting prizes and other information over the next week and a half!  Please, if you're interested in the event pop over to www.fish-a-thon.com to register.  If by chance you're able to offer anything for the prize table that'd be awesome as well.  We have one little boy that I know of who has already raised over $1200.00 all by himself, and many, many more people who are working hard to gain pledges for the cause and we always try to make sure that everyone goes home with a prize and a full belly!  To date we've raised nearly $50,000 and are hoping to crack $60,000 this year - with your support I'm sure we can meet our goal.  Far to many people suffer from this terrible disease, and I can't think of a better way to help fight Cancer and support our family and friends who need it by spending a day on the water!  Here's a few pics that Juli took last year!                                                           More to come very soon - THANK YOU SO MUCH!"

864436,The Urban Fisherman,2014-07-23 15:23:00,2050,"Hey guys!  We sent out an e-mail to all of our registrants but I figured it wouldn't hurt to paste it here as well for anyone who's surfing OFC at work! lol  First off, Iâ€™d like to take a moment to thank you for supporting the Fish-A-Thon For A Cure. If you have attended the Fish-A-Thon in the past welcome back, weâ€™re glad you have decided to participate again. If this is your first Fish-A-Thon, welcome, weâ€™re excited to have you join us.For those participants who are new the Fish-A-Thon For A Cure begins bright and early with registration, continues with a day on the lake, and concludes with a barbecue, awards, and prizes. Itâ€™s a fairly relaxed atmosphere and we leave it up to our participants to decide exactly what theyâ€™d like to take away from the experience. Below is an outline of the dayâ€™s activities as well as a list of items youâ€™ll need for the event.FISH-A-THON FOR A CURE 20147: 30 am to 9:00 am: Arrive At Deer CreekWhen you arrive at Deer Creek Conservation Area you will be greeted by a park official or Fish-A-Thon For A Cure volunteer. This individual will collect your park entrance fee ( $11.00 per car ) and direct you to a parking space. Once you have parked your vehicle make your way to the registration table. Registration for the Fish-A-Thon is between 7:30 am and 9:00 am. Volunteers will be present all day so if youâ€™d like to register earlier or later please feel free to do so.At the registration table you will hand in your pledge sheets and check your name off on the participant list. You will then be given a registration package and a ticket. Your ticket has two purposes. First you will need to show your ticket at dinner time and second you will need your ticket if you would like to participate in the prize draws. DO NOT LOOSE YOUR TICKET.After you have registered the real fun begins. If you are launching a boat volunteers will be present to direct you to the launch and help you should you need it. It is important to remember that there are 100-150 participants. Please be patient, boats will be launched much faster with everyoneâ€™s cooperation.ELECTRIC MOTORS ONLY:  The lake is an electric motor only lake.  The LPRCA has been kind enough to allow boats in for our event with their gas motors on, but they have to be trimmed up and at NO TIME is anyone to use their gas motor for any reason.  A phone number will be provided to all participants should you need assistance.12:00 pm to 1:00 pm: Lunch in the PavilionIf youâ€™re looking for a shady place to eat your lunch feel free to swing by the pavillion. Come chat with other participants, find out what the fish are bitting on, grab a drink, or take a quick break. This year pizza will be available for $1.25 a slice on a first come, first served basis.  Weâ€™ve ordered more than twice what we had last year so there should be plenty but please donâ€™t wait until 1 pm to come in for pizza as you could miss out.4:00 pm: Evening ActivitiesLargest Fish ContestShould you choose to participate, prizes will be awarded to individuals who catch the largest fish of any species ( usually won by carp ), the biggest bass, and the Deer Creek Grand Slam ( bass, bluegill, crappie, perch, trout, carp ). To be eligible for the big fish prizes you must have a photo of your fish placed along a measuring tape. Photo entries must be brought to the judges before 5 pm.Kids ActivitiesFace Painting, water balloons and a bouncy castle will be at the pavilion for any children who would like to take part.BBQHamburgers, hot dogs, salads, drinks and desserts. After a long day on the water come and enjoy a delicious barbecue made possible by our volunteers and our generous sponsors.Awards and PrizesAs in the past we've got a ton of great prizes generously donated by our sponsors.  Literally thousands of dollars worth of shirts, baits, rods, and so on have been donated for this yearâ€™s event. It is very important that we show our sponsors just how much we appreciate their donations by getting as many pledges as possible! Sponsors like to see that their prize donations have helped us to reach our fundraising goals.  At the very least a minimum pledge total of $35 per adult is required if youâ€™d like to receive a prize. Please swing by www.fish-a-thon.com/Fish-A-Thon_For_A_Cure/Sponsors.html for a full list of our supporters!WHAT TO BRINGFishing Gear (Rods, Tackle, Bait, Etc)Fishing LicenseBoating Safety EquipmentAppropriate Clothing (Be prepared for all weather conditions)SunscreenLunch Food - Snacks etc.Water/DrinksDigital Camera/Phone- Something to take photos withMeasuring TapePLEDGE FORMSNote: We will be providing everyone with a map of the lake.Finally if you know anyone who would like to participate in the Fish-A-Thon For A Cure who has not already registered please have them contact me so that I can pass this information along.Once again, thank you so much for your support.
