864049,sleded,2014-07-21 02:08:00,96,Well i finally got to use my Xmas present my wife gave me . Started the day with the smallest sturgeon they have seen  this year lol everyone had a laugh and buddy said it was good luck ! So we move to anther spot and within 5 mins I look over and the rod is getting a hit  run over and set the hook home into the biggest fish I have ever had on. So I land a nice 4 footer and I have a celebration beer and I prob had 2 sips of beer and buddy yells fish fish run back and set the hook hard and this fish is big right away it comes out of the water. Landed a nice 5 footer so beat my PB in 5 mins lol. I had a great day on the water we landed 10 sturgeon lost 3. This is truly a world class fishery and that's why it's catch and release only.  
864051,MJL,2014-07-21 02:17:00,2427,Awesome! I'm hoping to do a day of sturgeon fishing next month. Which guide did you go with? How long did it take you to reel those in?

864106,BassHunterOttawa,2014-07-21 18:13:00,29,Wooo! I'll be looking forward to trying it on my next trip to BC!
864160,sleded,2014-07-22 00:59:00,96,The 5 footer came right out of the air wish it was on video! I also had a 3 footer jump 4 times.

Caught two when I went but one being 230lbs. is still the biggest fish I have ever caught.  Definitely an experience everyone should try

864241,LucG,2014-07-22 16:15:00,779,Nice fish! When it takes more than one person to hold up a fish you know its a trophy!
