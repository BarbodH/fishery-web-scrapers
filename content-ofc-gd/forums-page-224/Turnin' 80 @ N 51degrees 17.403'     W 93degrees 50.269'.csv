Norma and I arrived last Saturday morning, have been pounding walleyes and picking up some nice pike while jigging walleyes.  Norma is having her best ever week of fishing with good numbers and good size on her walleyes.   She's brought in several nice pike, not quite 40"", but just a couple of inches short.  Fishing is great and we're looking forward to three more days of catching, before heading home.    "
