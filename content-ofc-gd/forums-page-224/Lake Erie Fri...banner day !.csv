863787,Rodwrap,2014-07-19 02:16:00,130,We tested out a couple spiral wrapped rigger/planer sticks with outstanding results !       three of them were 33 inches...every day should be at least HALF this good!
863801,Old Ironmaker,2014-07-19 04:37:00,8243,"That's the way it's done. It is getting hot out here. It has been feast or famine. # man limits being reported and then a heavy rain and wind and it seems to take a few days to settle back down. Good on you, we are happy to share them, plenty here for everyone.  Tackle is no big secret nor is location here on Erie so I ask. What did you get them on and how deep. My go to this year are reef runners and Ripplin Redfins on leadcore down 25 to 30 feet anywhere from 55 to 85 feet of water. As the water warms they are going out farther in the lake."
863815,spincast,2014-07-19 10:57:00,3279,"nice shooting. Looking forward to getting out there again soon myself. Winds  blew those plans off the schedule for today,"
863830,Rodwrap,2014-07-19 14:12:00,130,"We were running purple harnesses  100 ft back with 3 oz snapweights...on yellow planer boards. We got 10 fish on the first run   1.. 1,5 mph. The last 2 were stubborn, but we were done by noon We fished 97--102 fow. NO HITS when trolling west...only when heading east~!"

864056,Wagoneer,2014-07-21 03:23:00,118,My dad and I are heading out to the point this week hopefully. He's been hearing reports that it's the best down rigging in 10 years. I guess it's true!
864057,leaf4,2014-07-21 03:50:00,2466,"nice going will have to get out there soon, is there a reason for the spiral wrap? I've never seen that before looks interesting"

864137,dave524,2014-07-21 21:41:00,4508,I've done spiral wraps on rigger rods since the 80's. When loaded heavy in a rigger you don't get the line crossing the blank in between the guides. I've also found that the rod doesn't rotate in the rod holder so that the reel is on the underside as bad.   Putting a lot of pressure on a fish during the fight you don't get the rod wanting to twist in you hand so the guides are on the underside.
864140,misfish,2014-07-21 21:59:00,29133,"  Interesting. What you say,I have seen. The line does seem to be to the side and touching the rod.  Thanks for that Dave."
864148,JerMac,2014-07-21 23:07:00,37,Nice job wow that's some good eatin!
864167,Sinker,2014-07-22 02:20:00,8692,"I have a couple of the walker twistie rods. The do work good.  Nice haul of eyes. Ive never even laid eyes on erie, let alone fish it. Im considering a charter there next month to check it out!  S."
