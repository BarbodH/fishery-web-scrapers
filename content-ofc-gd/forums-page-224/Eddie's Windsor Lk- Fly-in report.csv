864350,chris.brock,2014-07-23 02:36:00,4053,"I left my packing until after dark, the day before we left, not a good idea, panic power packing!    Blueberry Road at 6am    ""Audio, audio, check, 1,2, do you copy?""    I can't complain about the weather, no rain during daylight hours, it did go from warm    then cool, fall like weather mid week    then it got hot at the end of the week  cannibalistic pike      the black flies, skeeters and horse flies were bad, the screened in porch at camp was awesome    if it was pickerel dinner, the first guys awake in the morning would go out and grab the fish, get them cleaned and in the fridge, then just beer drink and enjoy fishing the rest of the day with the dirty work already done    it's a rocky lake, these prop guards are necessary    Teagan, the newest member demonstrates the Leuenberger pickerel hold    my contribution to Eddie's camp, well, Eddie's outhouse actually    huuuge water to explore      a long battle with a pike on a walleye rig    shore lunch    my Dad got the big pike of the trip, 18 lbs, here's the release    it's an awesome lake, we all said we would like to do it again, with Beteau, Windsor, and now Blackbirch, Eddie's options are hard to beat  "

864356,solopaddler,2014-07-23 02:56:00,8605,Glad it went well Chris! Was expecting a call from you to go over the map before you left. Based on the last pic can I assume they still weren't able to dock the plane at the camp?
864357,chris.brock,2014-07-23 03:03:00,4053,"Glad it went well Chris! Was expecting a call from you to go over the map before you left. Based on the last pic can I assume they still weren't able to dock the plane at the camp?  a few times during the week, I said to whoever I was in the boat with ""damn!, I should have called Solo (that's what they know you as) to go over the map!""  good eye, beach drop off and pick up, but it's not a big deal when there's already boats there, unlike your trip"
