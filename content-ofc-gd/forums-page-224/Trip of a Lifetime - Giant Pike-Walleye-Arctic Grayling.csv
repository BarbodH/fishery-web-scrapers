864274,fishnsled,2014-07-22 20:00:00,3520,"One heck of a trip!!  Glad the fires didn't cause any problems for you, sounds like you were pretty lucky there. Hopefully they can get a break with some rain really soon. Loved catching graying many years ago, up that way.  Fun fish to catch.  Those pike and walleye would be a blast as well!  Awesome report!!"
864275,davey buoy,2014-07-22 20:01:00,5505,"Luc great trip,one day I hope to experience it myself.That last pike was huge?,love these reports,thanks for sharing sir!!"
864288,Joeytier,2014-07-22 20:53:00,3990,"Wow, that's incredible Luc.  I'm sure the pictures don't even do justice to those grayling!"
864295,AdamS,2014-07-22 21:46:00,161,That last pike looks like it just ate a pike! Sounds like a great trip. Its a shame about the fires but luckily it didn't ruin your time out there.

864397,LucG,2014-07-23 12:41:00,779,"Thanks for all the comments. Was an EPIC trip no doubt. I've been wanting to make the kind of trip for many years now. I've always seen amazing reports by other board members and though to myself I would never get such opportunities, I am very grateful I had the chance to experience this, and want to pass that feeling around to other. Your times will come!"
864398,LucG,2014-07-23 12:43:00,779,My though are also out there to anyone in the NWT or other provinces that are being affected by forest fires. This was the first time I've experienced fires of this magnitude and my respect for their prevention has greatly increased.
864399,Fisherpete,2014-07-23 12:43:00,1814,"Wow, incredible pike and walleye fishing and those forest fire smoke shots are scary! Grayling are pretty cool looking fish. Thanks for the report!  Pete"

864205,LucG,2014-07-22 13:46:00,779,"I've just returned from my first ever trip to a fly-in fishing lodge and I am left speechless as this had been the best fishing experience I have ever had!  The destination was Brabant Lodge, on the great Mackenzie River in the Northwest Territories.  On my arrival in Yellowknife, I was greeted by a province that was lit up a the time by over 100 forest fires. Simply getting to my float base in Hay River proved difficult as the only highway out of town was closed. After several attempts, we finally made it trough, and as we drove through the charred remains of what use to be a forest, I had no clue what was waiting for me once we got there.      The Lodge  Brabant lodge was perfectly set on the waters edge of this enormous river system and I was very excited upon getting my first look. The main lodge was very roomy and comfortable, their boats were 18' Alaskan Lunds powered by 50 HP Hondas, and their cabins were handcrafted log cabins that were kept just as clean as your standard 5 start hotel room.  The meals were amazing and their complimentary bar didn't go unused.  The guide we were assigned had been working with the lodge for over 30 years, and had even more experience with the waters we were on.  I couldn't wait to wet a line!    The fishing  The quality of fishing and the shear numbers of fish blew me out of the water the very first night out. Some places you could catch pike on one side of the boat and walleye on the other side. At some points it was literally a fish every cast.  During our stay we continuously switched back and forth from walleye to pike and went out occasionally for arctic graying in the evenings. But by far, the most exciting was the pike fishing. The average fish we were catching was in the 36-39"" range with several dozen fish over 40"". This experience has probably ruined my pike fishing here in Ontario haha  There are way to many pics to post so I will choose my favorite.Arctic Grayling  We caught these drifting a #2 mepps spinner in fairly fast current, maybe 4-5 fow with a rock/cobble bottom. It wasn't difficult to catch 10-12 fish per pass. They have amazing colors, especially when they are still in the water, and put up a decent little fight. And of course, look at the dorsal fin!!!         Walleye were abundant with the average size being 4-5 lbs and schooled up by the hundreds. I don't think we caught anything smaller then 3 lbs.      The pike was the highlight of the trip. Never in my life have I been able to pull up to one small weed bed and continuously pull out giant pike after giant pike. I'll let the pics do the talking.                As my week concluded, and as we attempted to get back to Yellowknife, fires again prevented us. After spending the night in a truck at a gas station, the rd opened and this is what it looked like for over 20 km.    I'll never forget this trip. Thanks to Max from Maximum Limit Fishing for bringing me along!

Excellent report. How heavy was that last pike? I'll bet those grayling we're fun to catch in the current. No weight. It measured 44"" and was very girthy haha  Those graying were super fun in the current and on light tackle."

Last week that one you drove through moved 1.5 kms in 10 minutes one day. It melted the road and torched a bunch of signs over a 10km stretch. It's currently about 1500 sq kms in size."

It melted the road and torched a bunch of signs over a 10km stretch. It's currently about 1500 sq kms in size.  You got that right!  We were lucky to have made it by when we did. As we made our way through, the highway patrol was pulled over at a roadside blaze about the size of a house. As we got on the Mackenzie, we look back and saw this and we knew he had shut down the road right behind us.    In about 5 min the same cloud looked like this. As you can also see there are two new fires on either side of it. Driving back I was amazed at the size and destruction. It looked as if a bomb went off.  "
864242,DRIFTER_016,2014-07-22 16:20:00,10439,This is a shot from Ft. Providence last week. ​Pretty apocalyptic looking cloud of smoke.  
864243,LucG,2014-07-22 16:29:00,779,WOW! Amazing. We were stuck in Fort Providence overnight on the 18th. Made it back in Yellowknife just in time to catch my flight!

864253,bushart,2014-07-22 17:31:00,2628,I won't hijack this great thread...just to say------I'll always remember my 1st introduction with grayling  Couple guys took me out where the Fondulac River dumps into Black Lake Sask.......It was like dying and going to heaven  Gin clear water....base of the rapids....water literally black (or blue) with grayling  And man---they were really good to eat (tin foil..butter..onion--toss in fire)  A memory I'll always have  thanks again Luc
864254,AKRISONER,2014-07-22 17:34:00,5558,"this makes me want to go back to my hometown in Northern Manitoba...ughhhh  My most vivid fishing memory now is 10 years old and involves my first cast off of a dock and 3 30""+ pikes following my line in.  Looks like an unbelievable time, for now I will remain envious."
864271,Rich Clemens,2014-07-22 19:50:00,3131,Oh man ... What a heck of a trip.   something I wish I could do some day.   Awesome report and thanks for taking the time to put this up.
