864632,misfish,2014-07-24 21:32:00,29133,"A while back I asked about making worm harness,s. It sure is addicting once you get started.  Getting the hooks to stay straight was a bit of a challenge at first,but when Mike Borger posted a you tube clip,it was pretty simple.   I dismantled all the ones I had previously made and started over. I sit and play poker on line and rig the hooks up first. Once I have a string of 20 or so,I start the beads and blades. Funny how fast I can make them up/  If they don,t catch fish, our Christmas tree will be well decorated this year.  I have been looking for some different beads and blades,but I,m working with what I have for now.  The blades and beads I am interested in, are, diamond sparkle flat black blades and black pearl beads. If anyone has a source,please advise.  Any hoo, a sample of some of what I have created. Ya I know some of you don,t use double blades  . I have a vision for a triple willow leaf harness. Might have some blades this weekend. My buddy is looking to see if he has some.  I really like this one.                . Think I know what to make for the next Tyler fishing event. I should have about 10 bags of 5 or more by then.  "

864634,BillM,2014-07-24 21:41:00,17367,"Do yourself a favour and run a single blade with a few (maybe 2) beads and a nice sturdy hook below a float this fall.   Might be surprised  BTW, I have no doubts a few hungry eyes will chomp down on those things, nice work man."
864637,spincast,2014-07-24 22:03:00,3279,nice work there Brian.

864687,fishnsled,2014-07-25 14:35:00,3520,Nicely done Brian!  They look great!  BTW - I have a double willowleaf in my collection.  It catches fish quite well.
