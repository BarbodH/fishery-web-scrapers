First time I bought a box from a maker other than Plano, should have known better. Got it home, it basically isn't strong enough, so have to take it back. Anyway, emailed Sail last night to ask if I had to return it to the Vaughan store, or could I return it to the Oshawa location as I actually live closer to it. Received a phone call from a kind, young man who works at the Vaughan store to tell me that I can return it to Oshawa if I wish.  Very nice to be able to save some gas and very pleased that they took the time to phone instead of a return email.  Well done Sail"

The first time I walked into the store I was so overwhelmed by the amount of stuff (which I now realize is never a bad thing   ) but the staff was always very helping."
