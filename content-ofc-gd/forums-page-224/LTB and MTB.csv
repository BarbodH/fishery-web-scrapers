Please note that I have no connection with these sites but just wanted to pass along what I found. It looks to me that for a years subscription the price is ONLY $14 bucks each when it is usually $160+. I have personally used both of these sites for 1 month ($5 bucks) then canceled my subscription.  But I can say that both sites work and are legit.  If you are a gear checkout girl like I am, I'm actually licking my chops on this deal.  Over a year, you will get well over $14 worth of lures plus the mystery every month of a surprise box of goodies.  I know there have been past posts on these sites so I just wanted to pass along the info to any others that may be interested.  The only kicker I can see is making sure to cancel your yearly subscription on time so that you do not get dinged by a $165 renewal.  I find its a great way to build up my kids tackle boxes plus maybe a surprise or 2 for me also.  SF"

HAHA, I was gunna say, if thats true.....ide be signing right back up  Just cancelled my subscription, it was fun while it lasted.....the best of the 5 boxes ive gotten so far have deifntely been the Yozuri and LiveTarget cranks....  If i bass fished more, i wouldnt have cancelled, as they also come with discount codes to order more of the baits you got in the box...15-30% off is pretty nice if you actually used/liked some of the baits you got."
