864754,mcdougy,2014-07-26 00:53:00,274,Not sure if it's in the press yet and I am unable to post links. But a extremely tragic accident in the costco parking lot today. The driver will have a tough time getting by this. And the family on the wrong end will never get past it. Absolutely tragic and words cannot display the sorrow that all will feel that know any of these people involved. Situations like these are when you wish you could truly turn back time. Condolences to all family members and friends.  My wife who works at the hospital is very sad to say the least. And she is a complete stranger to all involved.
