864128,Rustic-Fisher,2014-07-21 20:32:00,826,"Here's the deal, I'm looking for a some back lakes within 3 hours of Barrie , lakes with camp sites are preferred . I'm finding that with two kids and a wife back in university I have zero time for exploring/testing new waters. I have some OFC street credit with a few members in regards to back lake fishing LOL. In return I'll see if I can accommodate any back lakes info your searching for, within the same area. As for quality, I'm not looking  for your platinum lakes, we can start trading at the Bronze level LOL. If anyone is interested in sharing some info let me know. Cheers Ryan"

864351,mcdougy,2014-07-23 02:38:00,274, Do you take a small motor with you? And is this what the op is doing?  For the record I'm fine with that (respecting a cached boat  for a day)
864371,Joeytier,2014-07-23 04:16:00,3990,Boat?  Truck camping or water access?  Size of lake?  How rough of a road are you willing to drive down?  I could point you in the direction of some good ones that are likely just over your 3 hour cap.
864376,Freshtrax,2014-07-23 06:07:00,2215,Joeys lakes are good.   Might cost you a leaf spring to get in and back though.   It did me.
