Anybody have a place they know that does installs? I don't want to do it myself, I'd rather get her done right professionally the first time less holes in transom etc  Thanks, and Toronto and surrounding would be a huge plus...."

Grant Mills is very professional when it comes to this stuff. Chances are, the side imaging ducer doesn't even attach to the hull of your boat but rather to the motor bracket."
