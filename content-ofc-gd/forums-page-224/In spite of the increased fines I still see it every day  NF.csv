864009,Jigger,2014-07-20 21:07:00,1237,"Pretty sure the careless and points was discussed earlier. Police can charge after an incident if its found that texting played a role? The heavier fine is lip service. You can walk into court and have the fine halved and payed on the spot. The whole ""distracted"" part is what gets me. Careless driving pretty much encompasses texting already and carries a bigger punishment."
864036,Big Cliff,2014-07-21 01:14:00,6899,"I self imposed no devices while driving for myself long before it became law, drove my office nuts. The only time I would have a close call driving was while I was talking or finding a number on the cell phone.  I see it all the time in the city, mostly by young females. If I remind them about texting etc. when stopped at the light, man some of the language. One didn't recognize me until I pulled up behind her at her house. The daughter of an old pal of mine. Had her in tears and made ME feel bad. Tears seem to work well.  Cliff 2 wrongs don't make a right, you could have hurt someone else pulling around her. Ketchinany I don't think you are an idiot just not the thing to do at the time. Sorry, what would you have me do, sit in the middle of an intersection behind her in a red light? I guess I could have just blown my horn and scared the spit out of a bunch of other cars at the intersection. I cleared the intersection as safely as I could and before the light turned red. Might not have been the right thing to do but I had seconds to decide and getting out of the way seemed like the smart thing to do at the time."

864086,DanD,2014-07-21 15:37:00,2223,"Depends on how serious the collision is. If it's bad then we can get a production order (warrant) from the cell provider. We can seize your phone as well.  But really you'll just get a careless ticket if you cause an accident anyway  You'd think that the police would be using crash data more often along with phone records, to see if the driver is lying or not. The crash data that's stored in the vehicle's computer(s) would give you guys a mlli-second by mili second snap shots of what happened before, during and after. Things like throttle position, brakes applied or not, transmission gear, engine load ect. A whole lot of info that there's no way they could lye and not get caught in it. Or is the warrant that hard to get? I know we in the trade supposedly don't have access to this data; wish we could. It would stop people saying, my little Johnny said that the engine just started to make this noise for no reason. Plug in and be able to ask little Johnny why the speed was 140, engine rpm was bouncing off of 7 grand; but the brakes were applied. Honest dad I don't even know what a burn out is. LOL  Dan."

863849,Big Cliff,2014-07-19 17:16:00,6899,"People talking or texting on their cell phones and it's not just the odd one. The other day, a lady stopped at an intersection to make a left turn, she is so busy texting she doesn't even realize that there are no more cars coming from the oposite direction and sits there for a full 45 seconds.  I finally just went around her but by then the light was turning red, when she finally decided to go she cut off a car coming through the intersection I have no idea how the other car missed her, all I could hear was the tires, looked in my mirror and saw the car screeching to a stop.  My brother-in-law just sent me this and I thought it might be good to share it.  https://www.youtube.com/embed/JHixeIr_6BM?rel=0&autoplay=1&iv_load_policy=3  Pass it on, the life you save might be yours or a loved ones."
863851,kickingfrog,2014-07-19 17:47:00,8333,"I was behind a guy who was older then me (mid 50's maybe) and at 5 consecutive red lights he was staring at his lap. Every time the light turned green there was a long delay. First 2 I gave him the benefit of the doubt. Third one I tried to go around him on the right but there was someone parked in the lane. Fourth and fifth lights he was staring down when the light turned green and I was on the horn the instant it changed. I bet he had a story at work about the ""young"" hothead who was behind him on his way in. Maybe he was even texting people about it as it was happening?"
863853,misfish,2014-07-19 17:52:00,29133,Are you sure he was txting Rob.
863854,kickingfrog,2014-07-19 17:57:00,8333,"Don't worry, it was a small pick-up not a challenger. His head wasn't far enough down to be falling asleep, more likely reading, not sending. The only thing I know for sure is that he was not taking due care."

I was siting there and figure I'd teach Her a lesson!  Revved my car a bit took my foot off the brake and then braked, she took off and relized the light was red oops, I bet she put the phone away!

863893,Salmonidstalker,2014-07-19 22:19:00,265,"So instead of rolling down your window and telling her how unsafe it is to text and drive, you purposely trick her into thinking the light was green so she could run a red a light and potentially kill a driver going through the intersection. Some times a beep beep and a no no is enough."

863942,Roe Bag,2014-07-20 16:29:00,246,Police are only being reactive. If an accident occurs and a cellphone or other device is is implicated then there are charges. Otherwise there is little or no enforcement. Perhaps the odd blitz but that's it. At least that's how things appear in my neck of the woods.
