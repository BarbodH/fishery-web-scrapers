863932,bigcreekdad,2014-07-20 13:52:00,546,"Can anyone recommend a good waterproof fishing bag to take on your boat? I've got one, and keep all my reels in it, but as it is only one large compartment, it's a real pain to dig thru it looking for something besides a reel. Would like to see some compartments.  Any thoughts?"
864021,SirCranksalot,2014-07-20 22:30:00,3291,Could try something like this---maybe put some items inside in tupperware etc. just to keep them a bit more organized  http://www.mec.ca/product/5018-131/mec-transparent-dry-bag/
864108,BassHunterOttawa,2014-07-21 18:16:00,29,I was going to recommend the same thing: MEC has a great selection of quality dry bags.  http://www.mec.ca/shop/watersports-dry-bags/50004+50619/

Any thoughts? Just wondering why you carry loose reels in a bag on your boat?  Anyhow you might want to check out some of the tackle bags made for flyfisherman. Pretty sweet and many are waterproof. Believe Simms and Redington make some but there are many others."
864409,bigcreekdad,2014-07-23 13:12:00,546,"Mike....Most of the reels are spares ( one each ultra light spinning,heavier spinning, and one baitcaster) or fly reels/spools with varying weights and types (sink tip vs floating). All fly reels are in padded cases.  Other stuff includes....camera, two pairs gloves, portable gps, spare cap and stocking cap, spare batteries for cam and GPS, various tippet and bite wire, extra pliers, etc etc....and I'm sure I'm missing more.  I realize that utilizing ziplok bags is a good idea, and I do for some of it, but was just wondering if anyone had come up with a fully waterproof bag with individual compartments."

Had mine for more then 10 years I believe with no issues .  As for a waterproof  container with dividers, a Pelican case is likely your best bet but pretty pricey depending on the size you want.  This site seems to offer some better pricing.  http://www.pelicancasesforless.com/"

If you want to cheap out on a waterproof hard case, get an olive barrel from a local food store. Quite a few people use them for canoeing."
