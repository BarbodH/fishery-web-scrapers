762060,Metisfisherman,2013-01-24 04:44:00,11,"Hi All,  Thought I would give you a view which I hope will create unity. Unity is at the utmost of importance for all of our future generations to survive healthy and be able to enjoy the land and water which we all share. The Harper government recently passed Bill C – 45, a huge omnibus bill (a pile of new laws in one) without any respect for our shared water and land. It passed without any consideration of all elected in the House of Parliament.  Please see the following link for some of the issues of the passing of Bill C – 45 which should concern you.  http://www.anishinabek.ca/uploads/FNFactSheet_uoi.pdf   Please support IDLE NO MORE which is for all of us to be involved in, not only aboriginals. The First Nations have the legal tools(Treaties) to at least amend Bill C-45 which does effect all of us. By supporting IDLE NO MORE your supporting all future generations. Please see the following link.  http://www.chiefs-of-ontario.org/node/484   As far as the media confusing everyone, please read the full content of the following link.  http://pomegranatewomenwriting.wordpress.com/2013/01/17/why-i-support-idle-no-more-by-linda-goyette/   Think with your heart, what is best for all of us and those to come.

So hey, there is this place with stuff in the ground that people want, that gives people work, makes billions for companies and comes with some environmental concerns, welcome to reality, planet earth.  Hey did you notice what appeared to be a black oily subsatnce in the river that borders on this thing they call oil sands? Golly gee, thats pollution, how dare you mother nature, how dare you.  Funny how nobody worried about all of that pollution until someone wanted to turn it into oil (evil), and make money at it (double evil), and then use that oil to make all of the things we use every day.  Or to run our cars, millions of which were built here in Ontario, but starngely few people complained about that, about the manufacturing industry in this province that dominated the countries economy, nobody called it undemocratic, that same industry that got preferrential treatment for decades, the industry that mostly benefitted one province but influenced government policy toward keeping our dollar artificially low.  Starngely enough those same people who worry about climate change and hate the oil sands can often be heard lamenting the loss of our manufacturing base, mostly the automobile industry, last i checked cars used oil, and polluted, but hey i suppose if it's a unionized industry, here in Ontario and it doesn't involve those dirty rednecks from Alberta so the hypocrisy is allowed."

Traffic and border slowdowns by protesting First Nations are expected around the country Wednesday. But disapproval doesn’t mean the public wants police to crack down. Most respondents (59 per cent) said if road and railway shutdowns occur, police shouldn’t arrest protesters; they should back off and let matters be resolved in other ways. “I think it reflects a certain level of sympathy with the (aboriginal) issue,” said Ipsos Reid CEO Darrell Bricker, “but also I think it reflects the legacy of native standoffs.” This cool-down approach is most favoured in British Columbia (where 75 per cent don’t want the police to make arrests) and Atlantic Canada (74 per cent), according to the poll. It’s less favoured in Alberta (where only 45 per cent would suggest the police back off) and Ontario (47 per cent). The poll surveyed 1,000 people online from Jan. 11 to Jan. 14. It is considered accurate to within 3.5 percentage points, 95 per cent of the time."

761130,manitoubass2,2013-01-21 02:52:00,11391," The moneys paid to bands is part of their agreement. Those moneys goes towards basically everything a civilization has, health care, education, social assistance etc. Natives do not pay out of pocket, because the band allocates a certain amount of what they have received to fund their members education.  So in one essence, yes, it seems as if they are receiving free education. But on the other hand, it's being drawn out of funds from other areas. So it IS AT A COST, just not from your monetary viewpoint.  But many bands have tons of requirements to get assistance attending school. Here, drug testing is required frequently, you must be in good financial standing ie. have your rent paid up to date, etc.  I'm not speaking on behalf of every band though, I know, just like everything else, there are good and bad.  But before everyone spouts off about taxes for the umpteenth time, remember, its an agreement made through the Queen, GG, and the Canadian government. Whether you agree or not. And somebody in this thread made an awesome point in regards to taxes...  IF IT WAS FUNDED SOLELY ON TAX DOLLARS, AND THAT WAS REMOVED, DO YOU REALLY BELIEVE YOU WOULD PAY LESS TAXES?"

FREE money from taxpayers. if they get 1 billion dollars to distribute among each band, it's still FREE money no matter what it's used for.  like i said, education for natives IS free.   natives get FREE education and are PAID to goto school. you're telling me that it's fair for a native to get a FREE ride while many non native families are struggling to put their kids through school, if they can even afford it? if so, you really need to give your head a shake.     i wasn't going to say anything, but figure i should before i'm labelled a ""hater"" or ""racist""....  my grandfathers brother was married to a native and lived on the six nations reserve for most of his life and had 4 kids. therefore, i've been visiting the reserve and have been around natives my entire life and continue to go there regularly. my opinion is based on what i've personally seen growing up, not based on media reports.  the majority do not need any financial assistance, they simply take it because it's there. the self entitlement attitude is very strong..."

For those of you who don't know, about 90km from the village, on their native land...there is the only diamond mine in Ontario. I had the chance to go work there for a while. Company that runs the mine is De Beers, probably richest diamont company in the world. The rocks they pull out of there ,they're saying, are the best and most expensive in the world because of clarity and quality. More then half of all workers there are natives from Attawapiskat, that was one of the deals mine had to make with them when they started digging and everybody there gets payed around $30/h or more. Another deal that the mine had to do was pumping millions of dollars from the profit into the village every year. The company I used to work for out of Timmins contracted some of the jobs in the village...first thing building companies were doing when starting a job was to fence the place so natives couldn't get in and steel everything...but they didn't even get the chance to finish the fence cause natives were steeling the fence posts and burn them, obviously easier then going to the forest and chop your own wood So, imao...with all the money that's being pumped there, if those guys live in poverty is because they chose to, and if their roofs are leaking is because they burned the shingles in their bbq's in the summer never thinking the winter will come again  :D"

Because they were born as my child....a 4th generation Canadian and not native. What’s more frustrating is my children will pay for the Native education of the next Generation. And why is that? Because of an agreement made in the 1800's by a queen of a nation we are no longer part of... (Oh and before I'm labelled a queen hater, or Euro hater to...I'm English....5 generations ago)  Sure I believe in honouring your word and holding true to what you've agreed but there is something to be said about what this generation has agreed to with regards to any treaty... Which is absolutely nothing....not in my life time, nor my parents, nor my Grandparents life time have we written any treaties.  But of course there have been new ""interpretations"" on old version of orgional treaties written long, long ago...in essence stretching the meaning to fit modern times. Allowing the lands to be shared is one thing, giving the rights to fish in order to sustain ones self is another. But ""interpreting"" the treaties so that sustaining ones self is now equal to earning a modest living by today’s social economic standard by commercial gill netting lakes in order to seek a profit....that’s stretching things. Living a traditional native way of life from the land in the 1800's didn't involve outboard motors, and mechanical net retrieval etc...Now don't get me wrong I think its perfectly fine to earn a living by modern standards. But how is it fair to get the best of both worlds? Self governance, sovereignty, federal funding, free social services, not having to pay taxes AND....Natives can utilize the lands fruit for profit in modern standard to trade in commerce? How do I sign up for this club?...can I earn my way in? No... Its a given birth right for only natives. A birthright that was granted on the back of decisions made in the 1800's by a queens country that no longer governs us yet the principles stands even today....interesting string of events eh?  Idle no more is about not being complacent....or so I've been told. Well I guess if I had to choose between The evil right empire who ""supposedly"" wants to limit/control/end the FN treaties Or Supporting more of the same missalowcation, and prefered taxation treatment for FN's  I guess I choose to be non complacent....I choose change, I choose the dark empire.

761652,Musky or Specks,2013-01-22 23:23:00,2710,"[Please note that the below opinion piece was NOT written by me. It was written by Canadian-Cree Anthony Sowan and can be found here: http://www.facebook.com/tim.graham.1840/posts/10152413555635652 Since the post requires a Facebook account to view, I am copying pasting the entire piece here.  As a Canadian, I think this is an complex issue and this piece provides a good starting point for discussion]: I've been #IdleTooLong about this whole topic, and I feel like I need to express my point of view without disrupting innocent travelers on highways, and cargo carrying freight trains. First, allow me to clarify that I am a Cree man with full status. I have family in positions of political power in this very province, and should declare that my opinions are my own. While everyone needles over the finite details of the current situation, I'd like to paint my thoughts for you with much broader strokes. I'm so very proud of my culture. The way the plains Indians lived on this land was a fantastic example of community, art, respect for our environment, ingenuity, and spirituality. I'm proud of the native inspired tattoos that I sport permanently on my body. As a father, I'm teaching my son that same respect and understanding of where his blood derives from, in the hopes that his pride will outshine the prejudice he will inevitably experience growing up, or at some point in his life. I'm also very proud to be Canadian. Our vast mosaic of cultures, languages, and beliefs make up this welcoming land of opportunity for all. Whether you like it or not, we all have the same citizenship, but some have a different view on the value of it. I don't pretend to know all the ins and outs of the government bills, documentation, or policy that is driving the current protests, but I've intently watched news stories, read columns, and have regularly monitored the comments being made on facebook. Based on all of this, I feel the need to break my silence on this issue. 1 - It's embarrassing how the #IdleNoMore protest is being handled. Blocking major traffic thoroughfares does nothing good to bring support and awareness to your cause, it creates immediate animosity towards you. Protesting freely in parks or in front of government buildings seems like a much more productive way to attract the attention of those you seek. The politicians. Not the regular welder-Joe who's just trying to get to work. Hold him up and cost him money? See how much support you'll get out of that guy... Clarify what you are protesting for, or against. I've never seen such a passionate group of people go forward in protest in such disarray, and without clearly stating what it's all about. If it's generally about your need to be consulted, respected, justified for being mistreated, or the preservation of your culture, then let's be out with it and start a constructive discussion. Understand that you do not need to be consulted for anything any more than the Canadian citizen next to you does. Your opinion on things doesn't count ""more"" than anyone else's. Respect is earned, not given. There's no question that the native people of yesterday were brutalized, hunted, tortured, and humiliated for decades. It's awful, and no one should ever have to suffer like that. The elders of the time signed those treaties to bring peace, and offer what they hoped would be a leg-up in a new world that they realized couldn't be held at bay. But those days are long over. It defies logic to have the current population pay for the tragedies committed by people that came so long before them. The preservation of your culture is YOUR job, not anyone else's. For example, Polish, Irish, and Ukrainian societies thrive all over the country with very little or no support from government coffers. They celebrate traditional dance, language, and food all by simply passing it down from generation to generation. Native communities can do the very same thing (and generally do), but without financial support. 2 - ""This movement is about the whole environment, it's not just about the treaties....The bill that passed now un-protects the rivers, lakes, forests, land, etc, so we need this bill to further protect our children's futures. Thanks to Harper Govt, rigs and development will pollute the air, waters, etc..."" It's no secret that our Canadian economy is driven by the oil and gas industry. Yes, there have been some awful environmental blunders due to a plethora of different reasons. I heartily agree that we need to protect our natural areas that support wildlife, but I also know that there is aggressive legislation, and powerful government offices in place that already have that very same sentiment at heart. Millions of Canadians support green technology and research, as well as lobby for stronger federal policy. So if that's what this is all about, there's no need to blockade anything, as a majority of people would already agree with you. 3 - ""It is about the 480 page Bill that the government has passed without you knowing about it. It went through the house of commons and the senate in 2 wks. 480 pgs long...do you think that many people had time to read it? It says that under age criminals can be punished as adults. It makes more budget cuts. The librarians at schools are being budget cut. It is about A LOT more than Aboriginals, it's about everyone in Canada. The Aboriginals are the ones who started to realize the Bill was gonna to do irreversible damage!"" Back in the days of copying notes off a blackboard or projector in school, I'm certain I've WRITTEN 480 pages in two weeks, let alone read that many. In a political world where literacy at a high level is demanded, I'm willing to bet that most could plow through that many pages in a very short period of time. I suppose the content would be laden with bureaucratic jargon and would need time to fully interpret...but that's why you have a legal team. Quite frankly, I agree with underage criminals being tried as adults, and I'm willing to bet that a landslide majority of Canadians will agree with me. Budget cuts are a reality of our democratic world. I'm not sure if this means that librarians from schools are being removed, or the library itself, but the fact of the matter is, our schools rely on a healthy economy for funding. When money gets tight, things get sacrificed. I truly hope that the readily available knowledge in a library would be the last to go. 4 - ""It's not about the Aboriginals! That is what they are doing to distract you from what it really is about! It only affects the aboriginals- just like it will effect ALL of us!"" This is very confusing, but seems to sum up the general knowledge about what is going on. Who is ""they""? Are we going into conspiracy theory depths here? Do people not realize that we have an official opposition in place as a natural government watchdog to debate everything that in-power government is trying to enact? If there were truly earth shattering implications in the bill in question, the opposition would be whistle blowing and bleating into any available microphone available so fast it would make your head spin. First and foremost, I'm a human being just like you. I believe in equality. Across the board equality. Our country is so multicultural, that to give any specific group levity over everyone else is completely ridiculous. I'm not familiar with the particulars of old treaties signed, but I get the gist because I have used some of the special privileges provided to me. I do not pay for health care. I did for awhile in my young working life, but then the government discovered my native status and sent me a HUGE apology letter, and a cheque for every dime I had put into the system. Odd. I lived just up the street from my fellow truck driving friends, did the same job, paid the same taxes...yet there I was with this benefit because of my racial background and some papers that were signed all those years ago. I've used it for eye wear. This was particularly handy when I was “up against it” financially, but had broken my glasses welding. Here's the thing though, why should I have an advantage on a co-worker who might be in the same situation? It's not fair, and it needs to stop. I move that Canadians start their own march towards coast to coast equality, or at least the serious discussion of it. Our country should offer no free rides to anyone. No help for those who refuse to help themselves. No quarter for those who would inhibit the lives and success of others. No limit to what anyone can accomplish with a steely resolve, and a great idea. It doesn't matter who built the first camp fires and communities on this land, it's those that work hard to continue to stoke the flames of collective well being that matter. As a man that stands by his word, I pledge to never again use my native status to further myself in a way that isn't available to every other Canadian. I will leave my son unregistered, and will teach him the importance of keeping it that way. I am a proud native man, and a hard working, forward thinking Canadian that believes the opportunities and advantages this country has to offer should be available to everyone equally.  Sure to be called an Apple by the rest of First Nations"

761676,Twocoda,2013-01-23 00:49:00,4130," Before writing about how some of those continuing payment annual sums are spent for the benefit of First Nations peoples, I have to write about the First Nations Trust Fund.   The reason I have to address the First Nations Trust Fund first has to do with some of the comments I received on Twitter after sharing yesterday’s blog article with the Twitterverse.  The comments to which I’m referring are those that allege that any money paid out to First Nations peoples is charity money. Over the past few days, a document by Robofraud has been circulating online that states that the First Nations Trust Fund is over $2 TRILLION and earns an annual interest of over $35 BILLION. A trust is a way to hold property that lets Trustees manage the money so it benefits a defined beneficiary.  The property that makes up the Trust is usually defined by a written trust agreement.  The written trust agreements in this case are the treaties. The Aboriginal Affairs and Northern Development Canada  (AANDC) providedthis information with regards to themonies being held in the First Nations Trust Fund as of March 31, 2009.  Is it possible that the over $2 TRILLION claimed in the Robofraud statement is correct?  Since the only figures I was able to find date back to 2009 when it was at $1.15 BILLION, it’s not likely that the amount in 2013 is $2 TRILLION.  Could it be $2 BILLION? Could be. Still, $2 BILLION is a sizable amount of money as is the interest $2 BILLION generates on a quarterly basis. That being said, the First Nations Trust Fund isn’t the only money that belongs to First Nations peoples that is handled by the AANDC.    According to the website, the Department “may issue licences, permits, and other instruments to individuals and organizations that propose to undertake resource exploration and other types of development projects.”  That money also belongs to First Nations peoples, doesn’t it?  If the resource exploration and development projects weren’t on First Nations property, there wouldn’t be any  need for AANCD to involve itself ergo the revenues generated from “licenses, permits and other instruments to individuals and organizations” is First Nations revenues, is it not? And how about the monies held in accounts that the AANDC identifies as Indian moneys suspense accounts?  An Indian moneys suspense account is meant to hold monies “received for individual Indians and bands pending execution of the related lease, permit or licence, settlement of litigation, registration of the Indian or identification of the recipient.”  The AANDC website goes on to state that “[t]hese moneys are then disbursed to an Indian, credited to an Indian Band Fund or Individual Trust Fund account, or returned to the payer, as appropriate.” What about the Environmental Studies Research Fund Account?  It’s part of the AANDC as well and records levies pursuant to the Canada Petroleum Resources Act.  If it wasn’t part of the First Nations portfolio, AANDC wouldn’t be dealing with it. And how about those Special Accounts as identified under Section 63 of the Indian Act — the accounts where funds such as deposits and payments on leases are held for individuals, held to be split between individuals and bands?  AANDC controls that money as well. Indian Estate Accounts need to be included in the total amount of money AANDC controls since Indian Estate Accounts (pursuant to Sections 42 to 51 and 52.3 of the Indian Act) have funds from the estates of deceased First Nations peoples, those deemed mentally incompetent, and ‘missing’ First Nations peoples.   Factoring in the Indian Savings Accounts that are in keeping with Sections 52 and 52.1 to 52.5 of the Indian Act and pretty soon, that $2 BILLION figure from the First Nations Trust Fund is considerably more. And contrary to popular misconception, Indian Moneys Suspense Accounts aren’t what one might think they are.  In the Public Accounts Of Canada document for 2011-2012, the Indian Moneys Suspense Accounts are described as accounts to “hold moneys received for individual Indians and bands, that cannot be disbursed to an Indian, or credited to an Indian Band Fund or Individual Trust Fund account, pending execution of the related lease, permit or licence, settlement of litigation, registration of the Indian or identification of the recipient.“ In other words, there’s all kinds of money that belongs to First Nations peoples that isn’t part of the First Nations Trust Fund, and AANDC controls all of it. “But wait, there’s more!” as they say on those television infomercials! Have the monies due the First Nations peoples from natural resources been taken into consideration as part of FN revenues?  What natural resources, you ask?  The next thing to look at, then, are the fiduciary duties of the government towards First Nations peoples.  According to the AANDC website, the Trust Fund Management System (TFMS) “is an application used to manage Indian Moneys in Trust. The responsibilities and authorities as outlined by the Indian Act allow the Minister to manage the Indian Moneys as a fiduciary (Statutory obligation of the Minister’s fiduciary responsibilities to collect, receive and hold moneys for the use and benefit of Indians or bands and to manage and expend Indian Moneys in accordance with the Indian Act.) “ The next time someone says that First Nations peoples are getting a free ridefrom taxpayers or that First Nations peoples are mismanaging the money the government gives them, step back and share facts with individuals, corporations and government departments who are riding the slammin’ bandwagon. Education is one of the strongest weapons against ignorance. Elyse Bruce"

Maybe you should go back and read the post again. I never said that all the stolen trucks in the GTA end up on the rez. I said hundreds a year do. Do you know that to be a false statement? Its a fact, deal with it. A few years back, my Chev Silverado was stolen in Hamilton. My first guess/ comment was "" its probably on the rez as we speak"" ( I know, very racist of me right?). 4 months later, I get a call from OPP that they had my truck. I was completely shocked when they told me that six nations police had found it . I went to the tow yard where it was located ( on the rez), the yard had 100 plus Chevy/ GM trucks and SUVs that were either torched, or completely stripped of parts. Weird coincidence eh? My truck was sittin in the gravel on the frame with everything stripped off it. Now Im not dilusional. Im aware that not every stolen vehicle in the GTA is because of a native. But FACT is that a large number of them are.  "" only takes a few bad apples to ruin a batch"" The Idle No More movement is suppossed to be representing all Natives across the nation. Of course not every single one of them agrees with it. BTW, its not 1970 anymore...."
761679,Twocoda,2013-01-23 00:55:00,4130,"since someone posted a opinion of a native as to why he doenst support INM...i feel its only fair to post a report why this lady does support INM...    This article, written by Linda Goyette, was originally published on Facebook on Wednesday, 16 January 2013.  Ms. Goyette is an independent Writer, Editor and Proofreader, and a graduate of Carleton University where she studied Journalism.  ”Why I Support Idle No More” is republished in its entirety on this blog site with written permission from the author. I am no longer a journalist, and I do not seek a bully pulpit on any topic, but tonight I want to explain to my family and friends why I give my unqualified support to the Idle No More movement as a Canadian citizen. I am becoming more and more concerned about the harsh backlash among non-aboriginal Canadians against this peaceful protest movement. I’m not talking exclusively about virulent racial bigotry and hate speech, although it exists in dark places, but more about the willful denial of reality, the blindness to injustice, among many decent people. These are the people I address tonight. I respect their right to a different opinion, but I hope they will hear me out. Four Saskatchewan women — Nina Wilson, Sylvia McAdam, Sheelah McLean and Jessica Gordon — and Chief Theresa Spence of Attawapiskat First Nation in northern Ontario found the courage to say that a change is going to come. Thousands of indigenous people across Canada are demonstrating in peaceful ways to tell the country that they will wait no longer for that change. When I see round dances in shopping malls, peaceful road blockades, or a chief on a hunger strike, I see an opportunity to learn more about the deep frustration of my neighbours. I see no threat at all. The protesters are asking for the country I want for myself, and for my family. Millions of Canadians do respect First Nations, Metis and Inuit legal rights because these rights are guaranteed in our modern Constitution, frequently upheld by our highest courts, entrenched in our historic treaties, and valued in our intermingled family connections, our friendships, our minds and our hearts. Many of us badly want the Canadian government to respect Indigenous land, resources, cultural ways, and most of all their right to self-determination. I feel hopeful — wildly hopeful — that a core demand of the Idle No More movement for stronger protection of our shared natural environment will spread to Canadians of all racial backgrounds and political allegiances. I also hope that the Harper government will think twice in future before it passes omnibus legislation with minimal parliamentary debate or national consultation on the contents. If the Idle No More movement has allies, and it does, we need to be more outspoken. Our silence in 2013 will be interpreted as complicity, and polite agreement, with everything that is wrong with the relationship between Canada and the founding peoples. Firm support for Idle No More could push the whole nation forward in a new and more positive direction. We need to stand beside indigenous peoples when they confront an obtuse federal government that consistently undermines their success while it scolds them about local governance. In our homes and communities, we need to challenge the mockery, the simplistic assumptions, the casual and devastating bigotry that diminish Canada and make it a smaller, narrower place than it deserves to be. As some of you know, I have worked for most of my adult life as a reporter, writer and oral history transcriber with enduring connections to many First Nations and Metis people and their communities in different parts of Canada, primarily in the West. That doesn’t make me an expert in anything, but I have had a rare opportunity to learn from the true experts – the people themselves, their life experiences, their values, their hopes. I have witnessed with my own eyes hardships and injustices that took my breath away, not only in Attawapiskat in 2010, but in almost every province and territory over three decades. To those comfortable Canadians who complain that their hard-earned tax dollars disappear down a huge funnel to places like Attawapiskat, I say: Visit the place yourself, or any other isolated, northern Aboriginal community, and you might notice that most inhabitants, primarily children and old people, endure substandard public services beyond the imagination of southern, urban Canadians. They can’t count on clean drinking water, warm housing, decent elementary schools, safe roads, good fire protection or sewage systems — all services that white Canadians in neighbouring towns and cities take for granted. Other Canadians can rely on fairly capable local and provincial governments while First Nations have to contend with the inept budgeting practices of the federal Department of Aboriginal Affairs and Northern Development, not to mention the restrictive nature of our hideous national antique, the Indian Act. Read it some time. It will change your view of your country. To those Canadians who allege that all chiefs and band councils are robber barons who “make more than the prime minister,” and run a vast northern kleptocracy, I say: I have never heard an Idle No More activist or an Aboriginal person in any community defend overpayment of band officials, padding of expense accounts, or local corruption. Just as I have never heard any Canadian, anywhere, justify the overpayment of local, provincial or federal elected and public employees, although this also happens with depressing regularity. Overpayment happens because we allow it to happen. That can change, too. I would like to hear Canadians ask why the president of the University of Alberta, Indira Samarasekera, received $627,000 in the 2007-2008 fiscal year, which includes house and car allowances, performance bonuses and deferred compensation. Her salary had increased 6 per cent compared to the year before. Folks, she earned more that Prime Minister Stephen Harper and U.S. president Barack Obama that year while Alberta students contended with steady tuition increases. She earned more than any First Nation chief I’ve ever heard of. Yet do we hear waves of public indignation about the continuing high salaries of university and college presidents across Canada? Even a murmur? We do not. We swallow similar bad news about other elected and public officials who receive sky-high salaries, benefits, and sometimes, huge severance payments after dismissal for poor performance. That’s our tax money, too. We could at least apply our indignation evenly across the country, and we might question the national preoccupation with compensation to chiefs, and how and why that obsession came to be. Long ago, when I was reporting for the Edmonton Journal in 1980 or 1981, I received a brown envelope from a Department of Indian Affairs finance officer containing documents on the salary and benefits of an outspoken Cree leader Harold Cardinal who was working at the time to assist the northern Dene Tha’ with poor conditions on their reserve. I was in my early twenties at the time, and inexperienced, and yes, I supplied the news story that brought a good man’s hard work into disrepute, fortunately temporarily. I was a little pawn on a chessboard, pushed forward, to do the government’s bidding. Shut him up. Shut it down. I learned a hard lesson from that experience. I began to watch the situation more carefully. In the following three decades I noticed that each time First Nations and Metis leaders, or activists in the community, demanded their legal rights or a fair share of Canada’s abundant resources, similar official brown envelopes would whiz in the direction of good, bad or indifferent reporters and media commentators. These journalists would dutifully report the news of overpayments — as they should, it is indefensible — but without any context or understanding of how they were being used to silence, ignore and marginalize Aboriginal people in great need. Does the federal government release similar figures to the media about the plump expense accounts of its own senior deputy ministers? No, it does not. The Harper government encourages significant overpayments to a favoured few, on the one hand, and then spins this information to discredit the legitimate claims of an entire group of people. This is not good governance. This is dysfunctional manipulation. I don’t blame many southern Canadians for their singular focus on chiefs’ salaries — that’s just about all they’ve heard from the shills in the conservative media for two decades — but I don’t think people understand that federal transfers to First Nations are often significantly lower than provincial transfers to non-aboriginal communities for the same services. The Auditor General and Parliamentary Budget Officer have confirmed this fact again and again, and conscientious people in provincial and local governments and in the media have complained about it. Try to calculate how much public money your town or city receives for every school and hospital, for all salaries of local public employees, for road and bridge construction, for police and fire departments, for sewer lines, garbage disposal, recycling, public transit and so on. That amounts to many millions of dollars a year, too, even for small communities. Canadians interpret these financial transfers as a right of citizenship, the cost of a civil society. More than one million people in Canada describe themselves as Aboriginal, and more than 700,000 have First Nations status. The Government of Canada will spend about $8 billion this year for the budget of the Department of Aboriginal Affairs and Northern Development, including all transfers to more than 600 communities. About twenty per cent of the total goes to departmental administration expenses, but look at the $8 billion. That’s the same amount that New Brunswick will spend this year on public services for its 751,000 people. To those Canadians who say, “But I pay taxes, and they don’t, so I have earned these services, and they haven’t,” I say in reply: A large majority of First Nations people and all Metis people, now live off-reserve, work for a living, and do pay taxes. It is the Canadian way to provide public services for all citizens, even those without paid employment, such as the elderly, parents caring for children at home, people with disabilities, and people who earn too little in their jobs to pay significant taxes. Some people on reserves, and in neighbouring non-aboriginal communities too, fall into these categories. Why should we resent them? Their gifts to us are beyond the measure of money. More important, this country is affluent and comfortable by international standards because of the rich natural resources it extracts from its northern and western regions, the traditional territory of many First Nations and Metis people. They have paid and paid the rest of Canada—in lost revenue, over generations—for the miserable level of public services they have received through much of the last century. They have received no fair share of the benefits of a rich nation, and it is time they did. To the Canadians who say, “But Idle No More leaders should be more specific, they should define their terms, I don’t know what they want,” I say: Where have you been hiding throughout your lifetime? If you don’t know what they want, you haven’t been listening. The parents and grandparents of Idle No More activists lined up at the microphones at the Mackenzie Valley Pipeline Inquiry after 1974, patiently explaining to the country why their land and sovereignty needed to be respected. Decade after decade, others spoke to parliamentary committee hearings, First Ministers conferences, and every MP and reporter who would listen to them. Year after year, they testified at hearings of the Royal Commission on Aboriginal Peoples and at the Truth and Reconciliation Commission, and at hearings of the United Nations human rights bodies. In case after case, they took the federal government to the Supreme Court of Canada to press for legitimate recognition of their land claims and treaty and Aboriginal rights. They negotiated the Kelowna Accord with the former prime minister, and then saw the deal collapse. Their frustrations found expression at Oka and Burnt Church and Ipperwash, Ont., in the protest marches through the streets of Edmonton and Winnipeg, in the railway blockades in B.C. They celebrated many victories and land claims settlements along the way, and found allies, and achieved significant improvements on their own initiative. If you don’t know about this yet, it is not too late to learn. Rather than demand that other people define their terms immediately in language you are ready to accept, just listen, and remember what you have heard. It shouldn’t be necessary to say that diverse Aboriginal communities have different definitions of sovereignty, and different interpretations of their relationship with the Canadian state. People are different. Communities are different. No single answer is the total or final answer on any public issue. The very least Canadians can do is pay attention with some level of respect and gratitude for a largely peaceful protest movement. Other countries would envy us for Idle No More, and its non-violent core values. Their patience is a great gift to this country. When the percentage of Aboriginal people in schools, colleges, universities, hospitals and jails matches their percentage of the Canadian population, some equality will have been achieved. Equality does not exist now. I think this is a defining moment in Canadian history, a time when each citizen is asked to make a choice. Where do you stand? Where will your children and grandchildren want you to stand? I have made my decision. I leave your decision to you. Thank you for listening."

760916,blarg,2013-01-20 15:53:00,289,"http://www.sunnewsnetwork.ca/sunnews/straighttalk/archives/2013/01/20130119-074514.html  Now I know sun news is part of the evil empire, but only they and the national post ever seem to produce anything near balanced on this issue, in fact the national post has had several good articles, but this stroy from sun news sums up my thoughts about this fairly well.  CHAEL COREN | QMI AGENCY Some random observations from the inflated media circus that is Idle No More and the politicized fitness program and detox diet that is the Chief Theresa Spence fast. The use of the word “chief.” It effectively means “mayor” and those given the title sometimes speak for only a few hundred people, and get to do so for sometimes questionable reasons. Yet they are treated by mainstream media and the authorities with a reverence that borders on the sycophantic. Can we imagine a genuinely democratically elected mayor of a Canadian town being similarly regarded by journalists and the police? When these and other Native activists are interviewed, they frequently speak of prophecies, of seventh-generation warnings, of ancient laws and supernatural predictions. They hold feathers and they recite ideas of pantheistic earth-worship. It’s a confused, confusing, sometimes entirely made-up spirituality and one that is often absurdly ahistorical. Imagine, for a moment, followers of Jesus, for example, holding a crucifix and basing their arguments on an embellished and unreliable interpretation of Christian fundamentalism. They’d be laughed out of the studio, told to separate church and state, ordered to change with the times. And to a large extent the condemnation would be correct. It’s the racism of lowered expectations of course, where Natives are treated like children by white liberals who seldom venture beyond the comfort of the launch-and-lunch party. The same applies to some of the headdresses and costumes worn by Native activists that have no origin in their own tribe, and actually belong to people from 1,000 miles away. It’s cultural misappropriation, like a Belgian dressing up as a Turk and claiming it’s OK because they live somewhere on the same continent. This dressing up, by the way, is troubling. Aboriginal Canadians have valid grievances and must be listened to, but they live in the 21st century and have no need to dress otherwise. Compare this to Scottish nationalists who cringe at the pretend Highland outfits worn by professional Scotsman to appeal to largely North American tourists. We all have cultural identities, but most of us acknowledge that we dress for the contemporary age. Who is actually a Native? Some of the loudest zealots are tenuously so, and one of them appears to be German! Others have some Native blood but in the past have even been denied Indian status, and it’s probably more up to Dr. Freud than a columnist to speculate why they’re sometimes the more aggressive and unreasonable ones. Most ethnic communities in Canada are very careful to guarantee that white extremists do not try to co-opt their struggles and exploit them for their own ends. But the Idle No More groups in urban centres, in particular, are beginning to resemble the Occupy gangs from last year. We’re seeing the identical faces protesting and obstructing. Natives have authentic complaints; white, rich Marxists trying to annoy mommy and daddy do not. Then there are the anti-Tory politicians, who will do pretty much anything to convince people that Stephen Harper is a dictator, a dictator apparently being anyone who defeats them in an election. What a mess all this is, and — tragically — it’ll probably change not one iota of Native pain."
760928,blarg,2013-01-20 16:25:00,289," IM sorry but i've yet to read anything that you have posted in this thread that i wouldn't classify as leftist propaganda.  You are an extremist it seems, just like those people at rabble that you like to reference, you, they and all of the other tin foil hatters live in a make believe world, those of us who live in this reality want to see real improvements, and that doesn't include make believe scenarios where the native bands are on the same footing as the government, or where the country gets given back.  That isn't going to happen.  Sorry, but as soon as you start using catch phrases such as the 'government controlled media' you out yourself for what you are, in fact the most 'government controlled media' is the CBC and no other media outlet has been pushing this story as hard without asking any hard questions of it.  So, if you want to group yourself in with people who are anti development, anti oil, anti gun, anti capitalism anti Isreal, etc etc etc, you have evey right, but what isn't right is telling people the sky is falling and that Canada isn't Canada anymore, or that Harper is dictator/fascist, or that our country side will all turn into the moonscape that is the oil sands, that is what you have allied yourself with.  WIth opinions like that how can anyone think you are a credible source of information?  Im still waiting for anyone anywhere to show me where in law it says that anyone can do anything they please to the water in this country after bill-45, i mean that is what this is all about right?  If you believe that i have got a big lake parked off of North Bay i'd like to sell you.  Here is a video of some fine upstanding prpotestors who expect freedom of speech while demanding others don't.  http://www.sunnewsnetwork.ca/sunnews/canada/archives/2013/01/20130120-103816.html  I know, evil empire, fascist government controlled media."
760966,Musky or Specks,2013-01-20 17:51:00,2710,"Thats because the INM enviromental message is full of crap. Natives just wants to get paid to ruin the enviroment like everybody else does. Natives are not ""noble savages"" like most would like to perceive them. They are human beings first. And in case you haven't noticed we all want our cut."
760970,Musky or Specks,2013-01-20 18:00:00,2710,The Natives were here before us. And they took much better care of the land!  Im so tired of this misconception. The natives raped every resource they were capaple of doing and moved on. Thats what being a nomadic tribe is all about. They weren't industrialized if they were you can bet we would have landed on a much different continent
760988,Musky or Specks,2013-01-20 18:39:00,2710,I would also like to compliment the Deleware nation for showing the way this protest should be conducted. For those who haven't seen it. Damn can't figure out how to imbed anymore . Please take the 2 minutes to watch this  
760989,Twocoda,2013-01-20 18:41:00,4130,"Here is a video i made in December at one of the several rallies i participated in .According to the Myan calander a fire would be lit to cover the earth..Did it become a reality when the 7th Generation lit the fire for the rights of the eighth generation? As you will see Idle No More started off and still remains in the context of peaceful ceremony.The indigenous peoples of Idle No More are waking up Canadians to expose what is going on with our Government and its plans in the Name of Jobs...Plain a Simple...Either you approve or disapprove the choice is yours...With the growing numbers of people worldwide that agree with the Movement as they get educated to the truth. Canada is falling under a microscope of World scrutiny for its dirty little embarrassing secrets. If there was a war then there would be declared a winner...War was averted by a PEACEFUL agreement (Treaties) on both sides between the Crown(European) and the Indigenous People and together they fought off the Americans and later the Germans ....If you suggest the thoughts of Treaties are a ""thing of the past"" then the next time you walk into a Legion or Government Building that has a picture of the Queen on it ...Remember...she is a ""thing of the past"" and you wont have to remove your hat out of respect or abide by the Laws of the Crown..eg licenses for everything enjoyable and necessary to survive in this country. So in essence ...if you disrespect the Treaties ...you also disrespect the Crown of the very foundation we live by TODAY. In my mind the only solution is to honour the past....make amends for the atrocities and move forward in a respectful manner that is beneficial to ALL of us CANADIANS regardless of the colour of skin or tongue we speak...Coolslav....this subject is much larger than your present knowledge and you are obviously bias in your ""research"" for whatever reason....But i hope you continue to read and learn.  http://www.facebook.com/photo.php?v=10152379828855220&set=vb.894675219&type=2&theater"

I'm not saying we don't owe you. I'm just tired of this Nation to Nation crap. Your in or your out. I'd prefer to have you in, your culture and history are rich and diversified and makes us a stronger country in the same way that the Germans, Ukranians, Italians Chinese et al do. If you keep up the way you(FN) are going you are going to alienate those who would be most likely to be on your side.

761079,ch312,2013-01-20 23:40:00,1590," sad, yet very true....  blocking a road and annoying locals is NOT the way to protest as it does nothing but make more people even annoyed and does nothing to help the cause. that said, it would be very interesting to organize a blockade limiting access to the reserve to see just how ""equal"" non natives would be treated for pulling the same crap..."
761080,mr blizzard,2013-01-20 23:44:00,1589,"I have enjoyed reading all the comments and thank the mods for keeping it open.  I live in a subdivision setting up here. I have native neighbours living in homes on either side of me and we get along very well. They both were tired of the dual standards. They decided to go out on their own. The one neighbour told me very clearly, alot of natives up here choose to stay on the reserves because they are afraid they will lose their heritage which he mentioned would mean they might lose some of the extras. He mentioned I have it best, I have benefits given to me for being native, I get to enjoy the freedom of living in Canada and he said what alot of people on the reserves forget is you can actually go out and work to make money to pay for a house, groceries and your bills.  He mentioned that when the diamond and gold mines opened up here and yes they had to dig a few holes and disrupt a bit of dirt, remembering these ventures came about from money from the Canadian govt as well as foreign investores the natives are given funding from these mines and if you care to go and check out BHP Billitons web site preferential hiring is given to 7 or 8 native groups first. And if you are lucky enough to get into one of these mines if a native applies for a job you are doing he can bump u out as per to the hiring practices. As the neighbour mentioned it should be the best qualified gets the position period.  When u look at the size of the 3 territories it encompasses as much land as the rest of Canada with just a trickle of the population. As the neighbour half jokingly mentioned, our ancestors were good on foot but there is no way we could have covered all of this land. We all have ancestors, we all have roots.  Every nationality in this great country can be proud of their background but we should all have to play by the same rules and make this country great not just in properity but also in a rich cultural background. It has been a terrific read with great input."
761093,ch312,2013-01-21 00:11:00,1590," huh? i went to a catholic highschool and IIRC, each native was paid ($40 weekly or monthly?) by the government if they had good attendance and uniforms were also covered every year, which weren't exactly cheap. my parents didn't get any help with the $1000 or so it cost for my uniform for 4 years?  two of my buddies (one is 1/4 and the other is 1/2 native) are currently in school for nursing and neither one has paid anything out of pocket. actually, one of them spent over a year in school to become a cop and dropped out he simply changed his mind. why not, it's free?    treat everyone as equals and get it over with already"

The Author is a little to the left...suggesting the prostests should be allowed to continue.

760700,bushart,2013-01-19 20:28:00,2628,"I have been asked to continue......  I read this article today in the Ottawa Citizen  Stehen Maher---postmedia     In September 1915 the federal government went to the Exchequer Court of Canada to seek an order to force the eviction of the Mi’kmaq from the seaside Kings Road Reserve on the outskirts of Sydney, Cape Breton. Former Sydney mayor W.A. Crowe testified that the Mi’kmaq had to be moved: “They are hardly over the nomad state yet. This is an anomaly in my judgment that in the centre of a city which is the size of Sydney that there should be two acres occupied by Indians in that spot.” Chief Joe Christmas said his people didn’t want to move. He said his people “do not like to live away from that place. It is handy for their work, and they have a good schoolhouse and everything is complete, and we have good doctors and good agents and good teachers and the children go to school every day.” But they were bringing down property values, as William C. Wicken explains in his book, The Colonization of Mi’kmaw Memory and History, so Justice Audette ordered that they be evicted. “No one cares to live in the immediate vicinity of the Indians,” he wrote. “The overwhelming weight of the evidence is to the effect that the reserve retards and is a clog in the development of that part of the city.” The Mi’kmaq were moved inland a few kilometres to Membertou, to a bowl of swampland that nobody wanted, out of sight and mind, where they lived as second-class citizens in a community of tarpaper shacks and outhouses. In 1971 a young man from the community, Donald Marshall Junior, was wrongly convicted of murdering his friend, Sandy Seale, in a Sydney park. Marshall spent 11 years in prison, where he was disciplined for loudly proclaiming his innocence, before he managed to show that another man killed Seale and was released. In the summer of 1993, Marshall went fishing in Pomquet Harbour, caught 210 kilograms of eels, which he sold for $787.10. He was charged with fishing without a licence, but claimed in court that he had a right to fish based on treaties from the 1750s. The case went to the Supreme Court of Canada, which ruled for Marshall in 1999. Mi’kmaq immediately went out on the water to exercise that newly restored right, fishing for lobster, which fetches a better price than eel. This almost set off a shooting war in Burnt Church, N.B. To avert the crisis, the federal government sent officials around to all the Mi’kmaq communities, and the chiefs bargained hard, winning fishing licences, boats, gear, training and money. In Membertou, Chief Terry Paul and band CEO Bernd Christmas were determined that Junior’s legal victory would make a difference for the community, and they were ruthless at the table. They put the money they won from Ottawa with money that they wrested from a pipeline company after winning an injunction against the National Energy Board, which had approved a project crossing their traditional lands without consulting them. “It was like a one-two punch,” Christmas recalled this week. “It was great at the time. We were using the system to get to where we wanted to be.” They used this seed money to develop businesses. Membertou now has a casino, a mall, a fancy restaurant and a convention centre-hotel complex. Nobody in Sydney would now say the reserve retards development, since the band has $112 million in revenue a year and employs 700 people. Cape Breton-Canso MP Rodger Cuzner said Cape Bretoners are proud of Membertou. “I think people are impressed that they are able to find a way through themselves,” he said. “It’s seizing those opportunities and making the best out of those opportunities and not squandering them. I think they’ve developed a certain degree of acumen.” Membertou was able to do these things because it had the power to do so, because the courts forced the federal government to honour the treaties their ancestors signed. First Nations had power when they signed those treaties, but over time the Crown came to ignore them, and aboriginals were powerless. That powerlessness was at the root of the abuse at residential schools. Aboriginals couldn’t say: No, you’re not taking my child from me. They couldn’t travel freely, own property, vote, organize politically or get a fair shake from the courts. Those days are done, thanks to people like Marshall, who used the justice system that wrongly imprisoned him to enforce his people’s rights. People on both sides make a mistake when we think about our relationship with First Nations as a zero-sum game, where the Crown has to yield something that will cause the rest of us hardship. We are better off when our neighbours are prosperous, and they will be prosperous where they have the power to win access to resources and the acumen to use those resources wisely. Across Canada, aboriginals are demanding that the Crown recognize their treaty rights. The prime minister has committed to work with them to do so. We’ll all be better off if they succeed."

760740,blarg,2013-01-19 23:53:00,289,"There is so much silly misinformation in this thread that it is painful to read.  That includes things like links to rabble.ca, i mean it is only the community of the most left wing people in the country, some of them will openly admit to being communists, sure the opinion of people like that wouldn't be tainted by thos extreme beliefs, but then reading some of the posts here it seems some members might want to sign up over there.  O and then there is Pam Palmater, who works out of Ryerson, perhaps the most left wing university in the country that also harbors the likes of Wendy Cukier, the head of the coalition for gun control.  But hey, im sure Pam has no reason other than her desire to imrpove native lives to be a part of this movement, the movement that appears to be apposed to the current grand chief, you know, Sean Atleo, the guy who she was a runnuer up to in that last election..she has more extreme views than he does, and wanted his job.  But hey, it isn't like the far left to be sore losers when they have lost an election to a conservative, my stars no.  So this omnibus bill, yea, i don't really agree with it being done that way, but it's far from the first time, one of the first things Trudeau did was pass an omnibus bill, Chretien did it too, how many of you were alive then and were upset about it?  It couldn't be that when your guy wins you don't mind as much, nah, i mean it isn't as though some of you are aligning yourself with people who legitimately think Harper is a cross between Hitler and Darth Vader.  Go read Rabble if you don't believe that, that is the way some of those people think of him.  So c-45, did you know that there will be no environmental impact assesments and anyone can come on to your land or native land and start mining!  Of course that isn't true at all, now im sure everyone here is capable of googling things like the Ontario environment act, or the same for any province, and if you truly believe that there will be no environmental protection after the bill is law I suggest you call the province and tell them you are going to dump a barrel of oil into your nearest, 'non protected' waterway, im sure you can fight the charges with the 'but i was told on the internet there would be no laws to protect our waters' defense.  Im not saying there isn't going to be changes, but some of the stuff being said here is absolute crap.  O hey, did you know that some of the provisions in the bill, such as allowing reserves to more easily lease their own lands were lobbied for by some of the western chiefs?  Of course it doesn't actually say that they have to, despite what you may have read.  I read a post earlier that said something to the effect of, why do i need a pipeline, what will it do for me, well idk, considering oil makes just about everything in the modern world possible i would say that we all need it to some extent, or do some of you get broad band in you caves on the computer you built from stones?  You do know that the country already has pipelines all over the place, you must, so saying you didn't and still having an opinion on the subject would be pretty sad.  O but we can't have tankers being loaded on the BC coast!  That is just wrong, of course there are super tankers in the bay of fundy all of the time off loading millions of gallons to the refinery in St John, but it seems that the east coast is somehow expendable, but some of you don't need oil, living in your cave and all.  Also, it isnt as though everything we do has some sort of environmental impact, and it isn't as though people need jobs, after all, we will have strong economy if we don't develop our resources and allow our roads and railways to be blocked.  This movement doesn't know where it is going, doesn't really know what it is about, and the people at the bottom, those who actually need help are being lead around by a select few who used disinformation about c-45 as a way to stir up trouble.  Now it's about treaty rights, self governance, taking the country back from the settlers (yes thats most of us, even if you were born here), more money, hunger strikes(that aren't), etc.  If you think that we need to take better care of our natives then you are a paternalist, you deny their own ability to take care of and do for themselves, perpetuating this system is never going to work.  Neither is pie in the sky discussions about getting the country back, the 'settlers' aren't leaving.  The movement has been appropriated by the far left, the eco nuts and the 99%ers(the occupy movement), those who wish to behave more as our enemeies than our countrymen because they think they can get something out of it, caught in the middle are real people who for whatever reason need help, but sometimes helping people is forcing them to help themselves.  One final example, Attawapiskat and the non hunger strike, last year the government tried to bring in a third party manager, the band didn't want it, the left complained of paternalism form the government, the government fought in court and lost, and now there are a lot of problems with accounting on the millions of dollars that goes into the band, and not just from the government.  So what was the first thing the NDP and people like palmater(perhaps not her exactly, though i thought she may have on the cbc) said, well it's the governments fault for not ensuring the money was spent properly, so there you have it, look after us, but don't look after us, we can do it ourselves but when we fail it's your fault.  The government is trying to change that system a little at a time, and some of the people in this movement are worried that at some point the gravy train might not be as lucrative, or the idealistic 'we want our country back' people wont have weapons to fight with, while others are asking for more autonomy, getting it, and then being shut down by their own people under the guise of protecting the water, which will still be proteced, in many cases provincial laws are stricter than federal.  So go ahead, after c-45 is law go pollute your favorite lake or stream, make sure you video tape it and send it to the province, maybe a screw you you can't touch me quote at the end, just to rub their noses in it, i dare ya.  One last thing, I care about the environment as much as anyone, the idea that natives care more is another left wing myth, they are just people like us, equal, the same, isn't that what we all want?  You can't have that when you start from a false pretense about them being more connected to nature than us, that is a farce, all of our ancestors lived closer to the land in our very recent past, and now they for the most part live just like we do, and not only are they not going back to the land, they want more of the convieniences most of us have, no matter how isolated they are, and I don't blame them."

760744,bushart,2013-01-20 00:14:00,2628,Well Blarg  I won't copy your long winded pontification---once is likely enough  No doubt that you hail from The Conservative backbenches  Again as we are discussing Idle No More----You bring up Attawapiskat spending  You may have seen that note I made a few posts back where distractions make it easy for Longshanks to continue digging while diverting attention from his own agenda---it's all good  Nice touch throwing gun control into that rant and communists also---ya got a two fer  But I guess when opposition parties/Environmental Groups/Farmers/Fishermen//Outdoorspeople etc. etc. all say that budget bill will deplete environmental protection---they're ALL WRONG!!!----yes!! Thankfully someone nailed it!!---you can be right---so glad we finally have the answer  Do you live near Caledonia??  I do notice that you chose to just submit opinions though without back-up---it's all good---proof is over-rated  Congrats on being right-------
760753,Twocoda,2013-01-20 00:41:00,4130,So Blarg i suppose you think this is ok treatment for your fellow countrymen so your wife can wear a diamond on her hand...the people affected by this are living not in caves ...but un insulated sheds with a single extention cord to supply power....this is ok with you ? watch the video  http://aptn.ca/pages/news/2011/12/13/de-beers-decision-to-dump-sewage-into-attawapiskat-played-role-in-current-housing-crisis/  Do you disagree with the media of the aptn  and rabble.ca because they dont conform to your opinion?....you and Cheif Therese Spence have something in common then because she has no faith in the misleading Government controlled Media either....Another video for you that didnt make the news because it didnt conform to the bias of the Media...instead they edited her interveiw to conform...

760509,chris.brock,2013-01-19 00:12:00,4053," My wife and me are big taxpayers (too much tax really), I'm pissed about gov't corruption and money wasting, and the link between big business and gov't officials scratching each other's backs, while our planet goes down the toilet  I guess you can't assume all taxpayer's mindset.   right on,  what's a new pipeline do for me? what's a new pipeline do for Enbridge, Trans Can. CEOs?"
760535,Cookslav,2013-01-19 01:34:00,1457,"So after a bit more research on Dr Pam Palmater...  No offence but she's as scambled as the movement? She's speaking out against the governments supposed plan to ""make provisions"" that Would allow the government to remove someones ""status"" and ""remove treaty rights""....but she gives no specifics as to who, or which treaty?  She talkes about the ""offence"" our government commits when addressing the Nation in public by calling the people Canadians....in her oppinion it should be ""First Nations & Canadian peoples""...that pretty much make sick.  I'm just being 100% honest hear but no matter how hard I look and no matter how much I read There is a serious lack of direction for this movement and I do think despite a few vocal folks most of Canada is getting a bit sick of this mix mash of protests that no one seems to understand.  I suppose I could agree with some concerns from an enviromental stand point, but then again....is that the movements objective??? Nope....its only a fraction of the platform.  I think the good Dr. Palmater is far more intersted in running for national chief of the Assembly of First Nations then the movemnet itself if you ask me. Which is ironic....considering her ""anti politcs"" speak. Its just odd that someone so against the system seems to want in so bad  I'm trying...But I just can't get on board with this movement because I think its poorly conceived, poorly planned and VERY poorly communicated.  Maybe I'm bias... I'm not a big Native affairs Backer to be blunt... I'm not a racist heck I don't hate anyone. But where I sit when I watch the news 90% of the people protesting are between the ages of myself, and my parents....I'm sorry but I just don't think anyone in those generations have anything more owed to them then we have currently in place as far as Treaty agreements, and the social benefits we all enjoy(such as healthcare etc.)  ANY financial or social assistance no matter how small....is still a perk. Free schooling, not having to pay taxes...cripes sign me up I'll take it if its offered. If there is a right that was promised that is being taken away then that is a different story. I say lets hear it...in specifics, with easily obtained sources and something substanciated....I'm all ears and my mind is open...sell me on the cause.  I don't know, I guess I'm just kinda frustrated at the whole situation. Call me what you want...I don't mind I just don't think ANYONE in this country deserves any more then what me or my kids are entitled to based on what race, creed or color or age you are.  If it were up to me...No one would pay tax, and we'd all live a happy life in the country doing what we like to do, when we want to do it. But thats a pipe dream.... So given the choice I'd say anyone getting anything from the system should pay taxes, should vote and have a say....and thats that.       "
760553,Jay from North Bay,2013-01-19 02:52:00,7,"Maybe you haven't done enough research?   Then you come up with this? ""most of Canada is getting a bit sick of this mix mash of protest"". Where is your proof of this?  Heck most Canadians are push-overs, that is why our government gets away with everything.Are they angry at the fact that someone actually has the balls to protest their rights?  If you dont beleive that the Natives who got their land stolen from them, should have no extra rights? That is your purogative. But dont speak for all Canadians.  Heck most Canadians weren't too happy when European immigrants came over and changed their lifestyle. And they had a point.  The rest of what you stated are separate issues. Lets not start talking about apples when we are talking about oranges.  I think they just want to keep their way of living intact, just like the quebecors want to be recognized as a distinct society.  By the way. This is Johnny Bass using a buddies account. Over and out."

He is industrious and holds his people accountable.  I liked what I read. Dan O.  Chief Clarence Louie, Osoyoos, BC, speaking in Northern Alberta :Speaking to a large aboriginal conference and some of the attendees, including a few who hold high office, have straggled in.'I can't stand people who are late, he says into the microphone.

He is 44 years old, though he looks like he would have been an infant when he began his remarkable 20-year-run as chief..

The little band contributes $40-million a year to the area economy.Chief Louie is tough. He is as proud of the fact that his band fires its own people as well as hires them. He has his mottos posted throughout the Rez. He believes there is no such thing as consensus, that there will always be those who disagree. And, he says, he is milquetoast compared to his own mother when it comes to how today's lazy aboriginal youth, almost exclusively male, should be dealt with.Rent a plane, she told him, and fly them all to Iraq.

'No more whining about 100-year-old failed experiments.' 'No foolishly looking to the Queen to protect rights.'Louie says aboriginals here and along the Mackenzie Valley should not look at any sharing in development as rocking-chair money but as investment opportunity to create sustainable businesses. He wants them to move beyond entry-level jobs to real jobs they earn all the way to the boardrooms. He wants to see business manners develop: showing up on time, working extra hours. The business lunch, he says, should be drive through, and then right back at it.'You're going to lose your language and culture faster in poverty than you will in economic development', he says to those who say he is ignoring tradition.Tough talk, at times shocking talk given the audience, but on this day in this community, they took it and, judging by the response, they loved it.Eighty per cent like what I have to say, Louie says, twenty per cent don't. I always say to the 20 per cent, 'Get over it.' 'Chances are you're never going to see me again and I'm never going to see you again' 'Get some counseling.'The first step, he says, is all about leadership.

760588,Cookslav,2013-01-19 06:28:00,1457," Oh thats not it at all... I've read way to much which is why its so frustrating. The more I read, and learn the more I realize I'm right LOL... The message of the movment is not clear, and a lot of the mind sets are actually quite upseting to me.  I saw this video along with much more... But I'll give you my commentary LOL...  So she opens the video speaking about The Harper Government....and I quote  ""their solotary objective, their policy objectives for first nations has never changed  from the time they developed it in the 1800's until now on the books, the number one objective is to continue until there is not a single indian left in Canada. And with that goes the treaties and reserve land and everything else.""  She speaks of Provisions the government has made in Bill c-45 in which the Government seeks to eliminate Indians, treaties and reserves as a whole.....thats a big accusation. Where is the proof? Where is the source? Where is this written? Seriously...this is just smoke and mirrors, nothing but smoke and mirrors.   She alledges Indian Affairs is given ""$9 Billion annually"" from the Federal government But 50% pays for the Indian Affair employee salaries. Ok lets just say for the time being that this is true.... You do realize despite the gross misallowcation of funds that even if her stats are correct and Half the $9 billion is spent on office salarys thats still leaves $4.5 billion dollars in funding that Natives are recieving. I hate to burst her buble but lets put some common sence to her comments. $9 Billion= 50% for fat cat salarys =$4.5 Billion divided by 6000 employees(her stats) Well folks that equals $750,000/ year/ employee I think her math a bit unrealistic.  She's a great motivational speaker, but her delivery on Facts is in need of some polishing.  Now here is a quote that got under my skin....  ""We're not on a Nation to Nation Basis""  She's right...100% right If first Nations were on an equal ""NATION"" basis why would we even be arguing about the level, effectiveness or missallowcation of CANADIAN Tax dollar funding The we as CANADA are giving to first Nations people????  Thats like my Neighbor borrowing money for the 5th or 6th time to heat his home and then having him complain that I didn't lend him enough, when he's never paid me back from before, nor does he ever intend to?  The good doctor goes on to say the Average cheif gets Paid only $36K/year (unless your in attawapiskat of course) vs the average ""Canadian"" salary of $46K as if they are somehow hard done by. First I'd point out that I can't verfiy her stats and secondly I'd like to point out the Average Canadian is not paid in Tax dollars and after they pay income tax that cheif will make MORE then the average ""Canadian"" Oh and by the way the Average ""Canadian"" is PAYING that Salary with their taxes.  She goes on to talk about how apparently the Cheifs and senior community leaders have ""Absolutley no control of the funding models"" and no say in how the money is spent and claims their budgets will be slashed if they complain out of spite.... She then admits there are probematic leaders in the community but thats Their business, and they have methods to deal with them. She finishes with a bomb shell....and I quote ""We don't need Canada interfearing""  So let me get this strait.....She's complaining that they have no control over how much or where they spend the $9 billion dollars of CANADIAN FUNDING they recieve, but in the same sentence says Canada should mind their own business???  She then critiques the media as a whole for painting the cheifs as being corrupt and wasting money, and blames the Government for setting up a smear campaign, but neglects to mention how Indian Affairs has also used the Media's Cameras in places like Attawapiskat to point out poor living conditions....and how they plastered smear campaigns on TV's across Canada with accusations of government corruption and neglect. But then when the government decides to step in and investigate the accusations the good Doctor has the audacity to say ""We don't need Canada interfearing""  Here is a simple question for the supporters of this movement... Are First Nations people Canadian Citizens or not? Are they enjoying the roads, healthcare, education etc... I don't care if you want to revoke citizenship....just don't complain that you're not getting your fair share of my tax dollars if your not even willing to be called a Canadian Citizen. Thats a huge disconnect in my books.  I also love the saber rattleing... ""We didn't sign treaties with harper, we signed them with the queen"" Firstly...what Treaty are we talking about, what proposed changes is the Harper government attempting and more importently if she's going to get pushy. I'd like to remind her that actually.....SHE didn't sign any treaty. Perhaps her Great, Great, Great....Great grandparents did some signing. Back that was also back when the Queen ran this land, which she no longer does. So her saber rattleing quarel is irrelevant.  Then there is this Navigable water act change, and the referance to strip mining.... I guess she'd have us beleive the change to the act is directly related to strip mining. WHERE....how is this applicable? WHY....where is the corelation? I neither agree nor disagree with her concern here....I simply don't understand her concern. She'd get a bit more suport with some examples, or actual facts. Right now she's simply lumping in another topic to argue with out any sunstanciall proof of intent or examples.   Are we though...are we talking different issues? Thats kinda my point??? Are the protests just about Dr. Palmater's movment and her many oppinions? Is that all The natives are protesting? It just seems the protest has become about pretty much any issue that could contain the word native, or Indian, and its lacking direction and leadership. And alienating the First Nations people from ""Canadians"" reeeeeely does not seem like a smart move to me....  I'll give her the nod of approval on one point.... I share her beleif that all governments are corupt, be it a Native chief, Liberal, conservative, NDP provincal, municiple or Federal cronny. They are all crooks and need to be watched, so fo those who are in this protest as a watch dog I Applaud you, but the Movment it's self is not well thought out. I stand behind my earlier statement that there are ALOT of people out there who are not understanding this movement, not supporting it and sick of it. I'm not speaking for all Canadians, but I know the protest is not as well recieved as you might think....you want proof....I can't give it, but then again can you prove me wrong....nope.  Funny thing about oppinions....everyone has one."

760615,Lunker Larry,2013-01-19 14:12:00,122,"When you read this, please do so as if it is a calm, casual conversation. The tone of intent is often lost in an e-mail. Cudos to the first nation guys who have not been baited and have discussed and argued their points very well. However, something that comes up regularly in the media is how native issues are presented by many first nations and how it may come across to the non native populace. I personally find it hard to take someone seriously when they are talking about spirits, mother earth, eagles, crows, ancestors and such and do it to the beat of annoying drums. It seems everyone wants to talk like Chief Dan George in a Clint Eastwood movie. Join the 21st century. If someone is going to speak in the news, tailor it the modern era and maybe someone will take it seriously. Good or bad the past is past. Yes, treaties were signed hundreds of years ago when no one knew how this country was going to form, but there is no way in hell the population of CANADA is going to step aside and hand it over.Things are coming to a head but the major issues are getting lost. Chief Spencer is doing one thing, Idle no more another, and the militant western crowd another.  Get rid of the infighting. Find someone who can stand up and speak, not dressed like they are from the 1700s, and maybe more people will stop and take a second serious look at what is being said and not gaff it off as just another complaining indian. Sad to say, image is key in these modern times. You have to influence more than the hippies and free spirits. Blockades and public violence just makes people automatically dig in their heals. I wish I had the answers. I wish it was as simple as both sides getting together to retune expectations to the modern age. I have been a supporter of the Harper govt. Anything was better than the liberal goofballs of the previous govt, but, I have to say Harper has pissed in the pickles this time with the new bill and his handling of Atawapiskat and such. They've gotten too pompous patting themselves on the back for surviving the financial crash and are too myopic in their view of where the country should go financially."

Seriously, I'm shocked at alot of the comments in this thread. A fishing site, where little to nobody has mentioned anything in relation to the protection of the earth.  Free money this, taxes that, education this.  Yet nearly every comment is uneducated, and ignorance at best.  Irishfield, perhaps we should chat sometime via pm, and see if we can understand each others viewpoints better.

Use it to it's full capacity while you can and have these children make a mark on the world. You said education isn't fee for status folks... it absolutely is, even for off reserve status holders, and as pointed out by others they sometimes get bonuses after the fact as well when they graduate. I didn't make the ""decision"" to pay that money for my children.. I had no choice in the matter as they sure couldn't make that money over the summers themselves to get their education.#1 - Five years in engineering... #2 - 4 years for a New media degree.. and #3 - 4 years + 2 more years in her masters to be an Architect. Can't imagine the tally for the number of kids your fishing posts always show.  ..and Yes.. Sorry, I was at work and got behind on this thread.

Irishfield, thats a much better post, and I can understand it in a different light than the other post.   We all do bad things and things that aren't agreeable with everyone. But I truly believe this movement is a chance for the past to be set aside, and a way for all Canadians to understand each other, help each other, and most importantly, protect our lands/environment. The way things are going, nobody can justify the actions we have taken or allowed to happen to our lands/resources.

As a former municipal councillor, I can tell you the time involved in representing your constituents and various committee meetings easily take up 25 hours a week. A mayor up in our area makes under 15,000 and a councillor makes under 10,000.  What the chief of Attiwapiskat makes is sickening when you look at the size of the community and the number of people on the municipal payroll, (and yes, i have been to Attawapiskat, I was the telephone guy along the James Bay coast for 2 years).  As far as the Idle no more movement, If we attempted to block a driveway let alone a major highway, international port of entry, or mail line we would have our asses hauled off to jail so fast you'd be stunned.  I got some more 3 word slogans for the people doing the blockades,  ""get a job""  ""no more handouts""  ""start paying taxes""  maybe this would make the majority of Canadians be more sympathetic to the cause."

My $0.02 The attawapiskat Scandal IMO is a misappropriation of funds that was handled by the Natives in this case...its pretty plain to see if your asking me The Algonquin land claim is bogus...there never was any treaty to begin with, only the age old arguement of ""this was once my land"" when in reality its not. Its Canadian land, and had been since the day Canada was conceived. Its been to long to re-open that debate....unless of course I can lay some claim to the lands once owned by my great, great, great grandparents and expect to have it given to me. And really....unless I'm missing something I've read, read and re-read Bill C-45 and I personally don't see what the issue is here....Its there to speed up some proccess time and cut some red tape on Native Land leases options which still require the approval of the Minister of Aboriginal Affairs.

Yours are all going to go to College or University for free, if they so chose, and you won't be forking out $100,000 per child like I did because they didn't qualify for OSAP!  My mother always gave me an evil eye..... the numerous times my kids where burning thru $20 grand a year in University to a finally tally of $325,000 as of last week.... and I kept asking her, ""are you sure... Gramma never had a native over in the cold North of Gooderham..., not even one night... so I can claim status""?  Now that said... for anyone that wants to get on a level playing field.. .go get your Teachers degree or become a professor... all their kids get to attend the institution they teach at for FREE as well, on the tax payers backs. A much kept quiet secret that I didn't learn about until I witnessed a whole slew of staff handing there own kids diplomas/degrees at Ryerson graduation ceremonies!  I'd also like to ask those that live on the reserves... is anyone actually keeping you there, in what people are complaining are appauling circumstances? Is it the fact that purchase and earned income are non-taxable that keeps folks there, or is it the lack of desire to advance into regular society. We have a few here, on the board, that have broken that barrier and I applaud them."

If there was good things in either of these Bills there would be champagne and caviar partyies celebrating what a great job the PCs are doing for us Canadians....Fact is ....these bills are designed to support other controlling Omnibus Indian Act for control over the Indigenous Peoples for what Gov see is in the best interest of a very small percentage of the population(Corporate Oil and Minerals that fund their elections) Harper has flipped from his flop of what he thought was ""anti Canadian"" He counts on Canadians to be passive and NOT to pay attention until its over and done with....Respect the Natives for standing up for you and your rights from a Government that does what ever it feels it can make the most money from in the interests of the ONLY people that matter....and if you think you matter????

First Nations has won 137 claims of injustice and crimes against them as a Nation as seen by the United Nations Courts which Canada belongs to but doesnt abide by because of the attempts to lumber forward to oppress them. Did you know OUR government has spent 30 million of our Tax Dollars to stave off the charges against them cited by the UN...but only come up with a public apology to the first Nations as a resolution....oh im sorry we killed and raped the children of residential schools now shut up and get back on your reserve so we can continue to rape just your land... For economic growth do we need to harvest resources?... absolutely but in a controlled manner that will benefit ALL of us as two nations sharing the land...Diamonds Gold Oil And Forestry Fish and Water in their respected Territories...Give the First Nations their share of the harvest and then let them pull themselves out of the situation we put them in....If you think we cant afford it ...Simply STOP paying the Queen her share but i dont think the First Nations would never go for that as they respect the Queen and honour the treaties that were formed by the Crown to live in harmony with the settlers....After everything that has been done to them...im surprised they are as tolerant as they are.....Everytime the First Nations vent Olka, Ole Man Dam, Ipperwash,Caledonia. Burnt Church etc....I feel the future is going to look back and see it was a small price to pay and rather peaceful considering what could happen in a revolution.. .First Nations had a Law of the Land prior to our arrival....they weren't running around naked in the bush hoping for us to come and save them. With the treaties their Laws of the Land were precedent over our Laws   and were to have consent to change....we didnt seek to inform of changes we were making...we just made the changes and made up our own Laws and since we were doing our best to exterminate them....our Laws became the RULE of the land in OUR minds but not theirs (hence the lost Law Suits Canada has encountered over the past decade with Indian Affairs)... The best thing you can do is read read read ...talk to some First Nation peoples and learn the truth instead of buying into the the Government controlled Media spin.... When/ if you do want to understand and take it upon yourself to actually talk to some indigenous people ....do NOT confuse their vocabulary or communication skills as being any less intelligent that you...English is a second launguage and as im finding out with learning the Ojibwa launguage some translations from theirs to ours is a bit difficult"

Because Idle No More represents a strong voice against the destruction and continued privatization of our natural resources3. Because Idle No More represents a sovereign call to defend traditional governance and real participatory democracy4. Because Idle No More represents a legitimate voice against governmental racist and assimilationist policies that perpetuate neo-colonial relations"

760131,Lunker Larry,2013-01-17 20:28:00,122,"There is one very strong argument for supporting first nations at this time. That is the defeat of C45. Hidden in C-45 is the makings to remove all the environmental protection agreements so strongly promoted in the 70s for the protection of our lakes, land and waterways and basically trash treaties. C-45 protects about 5% of lakes/rivers for some reason and regarding fish, it only refers to those that are economically beneficial. So basically a mining, drilling, oil or gas industry can do whatever they want to the remaining 95% of your waterways. It used to be the industries had to provide an environmental plan for any proposed projects. That will no longer be the case as it has been turned around and it is up to us to argue against those projects. C45 is the worst bill to come out of our govt yet and was developed specifically to simplify and remove what the oil, mining and gas industries state as impediments to development. It's all about money. At present first nations and us share the resources that many of us take for granted. The first nations and us are having the rug pulled out from under us. Idle no More has turned into a hodge podge of issues for first nations. They originally stood up against the implications of C45. I strongly back their defiance of this bill. I don't back Chief Spence (?). I think that's idiotic. It's like a child holding their breath until they get what they want. The govt can't give into something like that.

Twocoda has done a marvelous job of presenting facts and Is to be applauded for understanding the issues without bias.  But first, a few more points to ponder in regards to Aboriginals and the land. Some of the examples being given are not being viewed as an overall picture, but rather pointing out one extreme to the next. Not all Natives live their lives by the 7 teachings, just like not all whites are catholic. So in areas where the people are not following the 7 teachings, plus other factors, you may see reservations with absolute horrid living conditions, no jobs and the like. But you will also see reserves that are thriving, and following the 7 teachings as best they can. Take this into consideration.  Also, many reserves are in horrible situations because of assimilation and the mental, long term effects these conditions. Just step back and think about the mental/physical and psychological toll many of these horrible situations have had on indigenious peoples. It's not like Natives have drinking or drug issues just because. It's because many of them are damaged and can't cope with the situations that were put upon them."

I'm glad they are there----standing up against this regime .  Here's an article off the idle website-------Western farmers-----did'nt see that coming  National Farmers Union in Solidarity with Idle No More Written by Sheelah McLean  Saskatoon: “The NFU is proud to declare its solidarity with Idle No More, which is bringing people together from across Canada to stop the Harper government from riding roughshod over our collective rights,” says Glenn Tait, NFU National Board member. “We want a better Canada.” The NFU is calling for the federal government to fulfill its Constitutional duty to consult and accommodate Aboriginal and Treaty rights and urges the Crown to respect and fulfill the obligations of its Treaties with First Nations. We are all Treaty people. The NFU gratefully acknowledges the leadership that First Nations people - the first farmers, fisher people, and hunters of this land - have provided in catalyzing a public call to action for environmental and social justice. The NFU, in solidarity with Idle No More and its allies, looks forward to building a society in which our forests, waters, land, and people live and produce in harmony. In response, Sheelah McLean, one of the founding organizers of the Idle No More movement, says “We are so grateful for the support of groups such as the NFU. This alliance is essential for educating people about how critical it is to have healthy land, food and water.” “Idle No More is not solely about First Nations’ concerns,” says Tait. “We share common commitments to protecting our precious natural resources - water, earth, air, and people - today and for future generations. Like First Nations, farmers put land at the center of our lives, but none of us will be able to work, grow, and produce if our government abandons its role as protector of our land and water. Nor will Canadians have sovereignty if investment corporations own our farmland.” “Bill C-45 and the omnibus approach to legislation is fundamentally undemocratic and an insult to all Canadians. It is no example of how to accomplish these goals,” says Tait. “There has been no broad-based consultation about what is being changed, or whether changes are needed or wanted. Diverse voices and opinions are systematically excluded, committee reviews minimized, and debate quashed. The Harper government talks only to those who agree with its vision for Canada.” Tait believes that Bill C-45, Bill C-38 and other bills are threatening farmers’ rights to own the seeds they plant, grow and re-use. Legislative changes are making it harder for farmers to receive the full value of their grain. As evidence, he points to the Harper government’s destruction of the Canadian Wheat Board single desk and changes to the authority, structure and budget of the Canadian Grain Commission that have crippled its power to ensure fair grading and measuring. Tait cites Harper’s secretive negotiations of trade deals like CETA and TPP as further evidence of the government’s exclusion of not only First Nations, but all Canadians from democratic processes. “The Harper government is handing Canadian sovereignty over to corporations that are not rooted in or committed to anything but capital. It if has its way, these entities will have free reign to pry our lakes and rivers, minerals, forests, soils and seeds out from under us whether we are farmers or First Nations. We will stand together to stop this from happening.”"

They should have been part of the consultation process as we all should have. I have attended many consultations at Municipal, Provincial and Federal over the years. However for the last decade there have been many changes at all levels of governments which are nothing more that a photo opportunity where they only go through the motions after decisions have been made. A lot of Canadians have given up voting at election time and a majority only get out at election time to support their favourite party but do little in between other than to complain. There is a lot of damage being done by our complacency, whether or not you agree with me or not I still have the right to protest against what I think is wrong.

759989,Tayzak15,2013-01-17 15:28:00,318,Wheres the section for caucasian people? or asian people? The aboriginals shouldn't get any benefit whatsoever compared to any other Canadian.
759990,Headhunter,2013-01-17 15:30:00,5703,"I don't see my group anywhere in that list... opps, yes I do, at the very top where it indicates how much tax payers give annually. HH"
759995,Rich,2013-01-17 15:38:00,3927,"So, what did it cost his Native friend then, if it wasn't free?  We pay taxes for our health care. But it's called free health care.  We pay taxes on educational institutes.. yet also pay for school? So tell me how it was not free?"
759999,Twocoda,2013-01-17 15:44:00,4130,This trek by Cree youth from Whapmagoostui to Ottawa (1100km) is an amazing feat and is a peacful protest that doesnt get any media because well....its boring ....but to those that made the trek it was more inconvenient then having to wait a few minutes for a round dance to complete itself on a highway while one sits iin the comfort of their vehicle 
760003,Rich Nelson,2013-01-17 15:51:00,332,"Caledonia set the precedent for Natives all over the country to do pretty much whatever they want... Legal or not. The police and governments lack of action, and double standard is now starting to backfire. In Caledonia, natives got away with everything but murder... Unfortunately, thats what it would have taken for the situation to be properly rectified. The solution there, was for the government to buy the land, and the natives are still there to this day. Police and OPP didnt have the balls to uphold the law, because they didnt want another Ipperwash incident. Im sorry, but regardless of your color or race, if you chooseto break the law, then be prepared to suffer the consequences. Im not saying I disagree with some of the  ""environmental"" points the natives are protesting. But I believe in the end, it boils down to them wanting another handout, and more money. How can you take them seriously when one of their leaders (Theresa Spence) and husband make $300 000 a year, while ""her people"" live in some of the wost condition in the country. ( and who do you think designated such a high paying ""job"" to the husband? Thats right, Theresa Spence. Convenient eh?  Her "" hunger strike"" is a joke as well. Guess she just likes being the center of attention. No doubt, natives in this country were badly mistreated in the past, and in some areas, maybe still are today. I dont think anything is owed to them today, other than treaties that havent been fulfilled. Throwing billions of dollars at them doesnt change what happened to their ancestors in the past, and it is obviously is very mismanaged. This is supposedly a free country, where all people have equal opportunities. Well then , a good solution would be some education, so that everyone in the country can be self sufficient, and have the opportunity to work hard and make life what you want it. This is going to get worse before it gets better...."
760007,ecmilley,2013-01-17 15:56:00,2163,"i have been watching this for several days and listening to all the native's interviewed seems the same thing keeps coming up about resources and protection of the enviroment, though it really seems to be about getting paid."
760010,Twocoda,2013-01-17 15:58:00,4130,Tayzak if you rent a house from someone and sign a lease....its your obligation to pay the rent ...(read between the lines) If your a Euro Canadian then respect your Queen and her decision to honour the Aboriginals Soverignty for as long as she gets to keep drawing from the pot of gold
760014,Jigs,2013-01-17 16:09:00,136,"I usually tend to stay away from political discussion online, but I have to say I am really impressed with the quality with which ManitouBass2 has presented his points in this thread and it encouraged me to share some thoughts. I agree wholeheartedly with him.  As a hunter and fisherman and as someone who is deeply concerned about the endless pit that is Industry growth and bill C-45 among others I have to say I am favourable to the Idle no more movement.  I also think that the disappearance of Traditional Native Culture and in particular that of Ecological Knowledge that has been passed down from generations over thousands of years is a loss not only to them but to all Canadians. Their connection to the land and water and their devotion to protect it is something I have always admired. To see that disappear, I think,  would be a shame for everyone not only to Indigenous people. I do support and understand the need for Economic growth and job creation, however I think the balance is skewed and it is an illusion to think that its rewards go back to the people. In my opinion that growth profits big-wigs in Industry and government more than it does the average Joe.  I also empathize with those who's routine was disrupted by the protests, but unfortunately to get your point across in today's world you need to make some sort of small impact. I would never however, condone violent protesting of any kind.  I have to say in this case, they have my support because I am concerned about the government's attempt to revoke laws that protect Natural Resources in this country and I am concerned about the disappearance of traditional Native culture.  My two cents anyway."
760016,LeXXington,2013-01-17 16:11:00,1928,"These are intresting post and great to read.  I have to agree with both sides have points in this issue but I don't think the idle no more is clear on what they want, also on what can be fixed.  If the goverment gave a billion more but it went to the select few and then was gone. We would not solve the issues.  Both parties need to figure out what can be fixed."
760020,Headhunter,2013-01-17 16:19:00,5703,Aboringal Sovernty would mean self sufficiency to me… and we all know that aint gonna happen. HH ..
760026,Tayzak15,2013-01-17 16:28:00,318,Is that the best you can come up with? The aboriginals are undeserving and they know it. Not one race of person deserves more tax dollars over another in this country. No reason for you guys to be mad at Harper. You should be questioning Spence. The government gives you the money its the decision of the chiefs on how it is spent. Its time to get rid of the Indian Act
760031,F7Firecat,2013-01-17 16:30:00,347,"Natives are not being mistreated by our government, they are being mistreated by their OWN CHIEFS. The money is there and lots of it, it just gets distributed to a select few while the rest live in poverty."
760037,Tayzak15,2013-01-17 16:41:00,318,This is exactly it.
760041,fishindevil,2013-01-17 16:44:00,6254,ya pretty much says it all....
760044,Twocoda,2013-01-17 16:45:00,4130,Sorry i was trying to simplify at my perception of your level of understanding....allow me to fill in the lines for you...but it will require your reading the article rather then my short sited paragraph http://rabble.ca/news/2013/01/message-canadians-dont-let-ignorant-and-uniformed-speak-loudest#.UPgd9jc8EL4.twitter
760047,capt_hooked,2013-01-17 16:54:00,212,"The protest on Hwy.17, between Sturgeon Falls and North Bay, was very polite and they only hell up my ambulance until the driver flashed his lights and siren.  Here is an interesting review by Adrienne Arsenault of CBC:  https://www.youtube.com/embed/1ynaC8f5ues  Manitoubass2,  RRFN  (Emo, Ontario, near the U.S. border) this looks like a nice civilized and warm part of the country. Although I have never been there I suspect it would be a great place to visit.    But I am curious if you have ever visited Attawapiskat?  Attatwpiskat is cold, very cold in the winter.  But I would recommend visiting it in July, after the snow melts and uncovers the real mess.  My experience, living and working with native people, in far northern communities, for many years has been very rewarding.  However I have found Natives to be no more environmentally conscious than the average Canadian and (in local areas) perhaps less so?  The great illusion that our Native people are proud keepers of the land and wildlife .. is often only that.  When all is said and done, I have found us/we to be very much the same, no better and no worse.  So lets try and work together to solve our problems.  Thisi is a great country.  "
759914,kemper,2013-01-17 05:31:00,2232,Never mind... Need to know more about the issues at hand
759915,manitoubass2,2013-01-17 05:39:00,11391," Always good to be informed!  Feel free to ask me any questions if ya have any for me, or looking for sources   Misinformation is causing more issues in this country then #INM"
759917,kemper,2013-01-17 05:56:00,2232,As always there is misinformation on both sides of this one...
759918,irishfield,2013-01-17 06:13:00,26272,"Of course there is misinformation on both sides ... it makes for ""good"" news reporting!  In todays age, there is no reason to be misinformed on any of this..... even Clayton Kennedy (Chief Spence's boyfriend) doesn't deny he got paid $850/day(TAX FREE) while his fellow citzens live in unheated homes with little or no food. More money than my daughters neurosurgeon gets paid/day by OHIP!"
759921,Twocoda,2013-01-17 07:36:00,4130,Chiefs are equivalent to mayors....On average a mayor is paid 95 K a year....on average a chief is paid 36k a year (there are cheifs that do it for nothing)....Spence is paid 69 k a year what her boyfriend makes isnt relative like it isnt relative what Rob Fords wife makes per year....Spences boyfriend may make 850 a day ...but may only work one day a month for his services to the band so in essence ....he would make 850 a month and the only reason he is employed by the band is because of the stringent reports that have to be submitted to our Gov justifying the money that is released to the band with full disclosure for transparency...On the other hand ...our government claims they give 90 million to the band when in essence they havent given them a fraction of that money...Where is the money????Harper says he doesnt know and he cant disclose where the money actually is...(I would expect someone to be held accountable....but it will get swept under the rug) Now lets look at the issue of starving waterless people living in a town/rez while the Chief is makeing 69k a year and now putting her life on the line for them....Rob Ford makes in excess of 100k a year and walks right past people living under bridges in toronto....but interesting enough ...do you think Ford would put his life on the line for the homeless people in Toronto?...i hardly think so....It just wouldnt happen from a politician ....but he will scream to the Federal Government for money to build parks under bridges and get it .....so ...if we are all equal Canadians ....what is more important drinking water that doesnt light on fire or ensuring your city kids have a bridge to play under in style...
759922,pics,2013-01-17 08:02:00,1268,Rob Ford is the mayor of a city with 2.6 million people and thousands of employees. Spence is chief of 300 or so members!!! Plus she has band council members(21?).... Maybe her pay should be cut to jus a few hundred bucks and Ford should get a big raise.....

759937,Tayzak15,2013-01-17 12:13:00,318,  This video right here should clear up some stuff for people wondering its a quick 5 mins video but shows the flaws of this protest. feel free to comment.
759938,F7Firecat,2013-01-17 12:14:00,347,"Hey buddy,  If your not native you go close the bridge down and see how long you last. If your native you can squat as long as you like with OPP protection. Give your head a shake........  We put up with enogh of this in Caledonia, time for the people to do their jobs and clear them out."
759939,lew,2013-01-17 12:19:00,12766," One incident that always sticks in my mind was the blockade in Caledonia when the police van was driving through the crowd and a person smashed out the rear window with a bat. The police could be seen in the van but they never even got out, let alone arrest the bat wielder.  Can't imagine I'd ever get away with that.  I don't pretend to understand all their issues, but blockading highways & rail lines and destroying public properties doesn't seem to me to be a way of getting public support....but that's just my opinion.  This is a topic that's important to everyone in this country and it'd be nice to hear the opinions of those that actually understand the issues without this thread going down the drain and getting locked up like usual."
759940,Live2fish85,2013-01-17 12:24:00,1633,"I have nothing but respect for Natives, always have.  This is just stupid though. I hear a lot of complaining of what the government has done to them lol. What is that given them free schooling, health care, assistance. I mean if things aren't all great on the reserve no one is making you stay there."
759949,moxie,2013-01-17 12:58:00,1566,"Your implications are bang on Wayne. They don't have to work, They don't pay taxes, Their chiefs are given boat loads of our money every wrong word year. But lets turn this on its head this time. If you have time, join them. This could be a great cause for all Canadians to get behind. After all its called ""Idle No More"". Just a thought. I like a lot of what Harpers' done but lets be frank, politicians don't work for us they appease us enough so we don't light the store on fire."

759951,John,2013-01-17 13:24:00,2956,"I have absolutely no issues with peaceful demonstration, whatever your cause. But, when lives are disrupted, laws are broken, property is damaged or destroyed,  and violence against others occurs it can not be tolerated. ALL offenders regardless of race, creed, religion or status need to be dealt with as the law requires.........no exceptions. I think that this is the problem that most of us have. If I want to stand on the sidewalk and preach about my cause to all that will listen, all is well with the world. If I decide that I want to kick things up a notch and set fire to my neighbours car or throw rocks at windows, I will and should be arrested......"
759952,moxie,2013-01-17 13:25:00,1566,"  Our household, as many others pay over 50% of our take to Governments every damn year and we are getting less and less in return. Aren't we all CANADIANS here? Look at this as a CALL TO ACTION.  We could hijack this protest and let the rats in every governmental institution from coast to coast realize that its time to pay the dealer his due. Its not about how much anyone makes but what we expect in exchange. They love it when their social engineering stamp divides us because it pits us against each other instead of them. But alas, it will probably end up as another opportunity lost. Say what we will about the Indians and how they conduct themselves but at least they have the nuts to stand up and be counted."
759953,manitoubass2,2013-01-17 13:29:00,11391," Why give my head a shake?  There was 3 blockades near my house yesterday alone. I've spoken with officers at the rallies, and never had an issue. The police are being informed before these rallies happen, so they can react accordingly.  And to those worries about certain routes being blocked, most of that can be fixed with a quick google search to see where rallies are being held.  Many Natives pay taxes just like everyone else. Bands are given a lump sump of money by the government to be divided amongst all of First Nations. Sounds like alot, but not so much when divided up.  Natives DO NOT get free schooling. And what they do receive is far less then average in this country.  Moneys payed to bands in this country are AS PER THE NEGOTIATED TREATY RIGHTS.  A huge part of this movement is environmental concern, another part is for the Canadian government to respect and honour the negotiated treaty rights of indigenous people. Also to be included in these types of decisions"

759958,Live2fish85,2013-01-17 13:44:00,1633,That is funny because a good friend of mine went to Trent  University for free so was his schooling at Fleming college.  
759960,manitoubass2,2013-01-17 13:47:00,11391," Money is allocated from what the bands receive as per the treaty negotiations etc. So education takes up a pretty big percentage of the overall monies a band has to operate with.  That my friend, is not ""free schooling"""
759961,SirCranksalot,2013-01-17 13:48:00,3291,"  Double standard indeed. Why are folks so interested in have the cops crack down on what is a relatively minor offence, but no such interest when major crimes up to and incl murder are committed against First Nations people? High profile cases in BC and Sask spring to mind but there have been lots more.  You bet we have a double standard!!"

759852,Rich,2013-01-17 01:49:00,3927,What are you referring to ?

759863,Rich Nelson,2013-01-17 02:24:00,332," I think the double standard is ridiculous. Government and OPP are deathly afraid that someone might get hurt or killed if they step in and do their job.  Its getting out of hand, and its only going to get a lot worse before it gets better."
759866,manitoubass2,2013-01-17 02:34:00,11391,"Just what is the double standard you are referring too? Its my understanding that every Canadian has a right to protest peacefully.  A minor inconvenience is just that, and considerably more enjoyable then some things indigenous people have suffered through because of the Canadian Government.  I applaud the movement and it's cause.  I also think it's a great way to voice our concerns over these omnibus legislations and the protection, or lacktherof, of nature in this country.

Those  actions also had serious consequences. Some communities polarized between native and non-native, forcing people to chose sides along racial lines. Both sides being equally guilty.  Some communities were hurt by the disruptions, and those people retaliated economically. I fear this will again bring about a similar polarization."

759901,kemper,2013-01-17 04:26:00,2232,"Maybe it's because I've never had much to protest about, but I have an extreme lack of patience for any type of protest that interferes with the daily responsibilities of other people.  Demonstrating at the side of the road is one thing...demonstrating ON the road is entirely different.  The race, nationality, occupation, sexual orientation, or favourite fishing lure of said protesting individuals matters not to me. Protest or demonstrate for your cause all you want, just don't stop other people from doing the things they are responsible  for doing."
759903,irishfield,2013-01-17 04:29:00,26272,"Exactly Kemp.. they are breaking the law by blocking highways, railways and every other mode in between. Anyone else would be handcuffed and drug off to the clink."
759905,SlowPoke,2013-01-17 04:48:00,2984,"Well said. A blockade is not a peaceful protest. At best, its an attempt to draw attention to the cause by creating an annoyance. At worst, (and much too often) its an attempt to provoke an incident."
759906,Twocoda,2013-01-17 04:53:00,4130,ANY LAWS that are passed in government without debate or neglect to experts advice is Bad law....Bad policy and Bull....McGuilty got his due for doing it ....now Harper is going to get his due....Democracy has educated debates and votes.....Omnibus bills have no place in our government....just to accommodate the corporate status quo    ( it becomes dictatorship) Interesting times indeed....history in the making for hopefully a new horizon
759910,Twocoda,2013-01-17 05:25:00,4130,Wayne your daughter will not even notice a loss of her pay for the time she was in convenience by the blockade but the government WILL notice the loss of revenue they collect off her cheque....any longer then 4 hours of loss /40hr wk then she will notice.....The only way to get the attention of the PM is to get the people aware of what truly is going on. Then once they/we all realize the entire situation then we can either complain or support the revolution.....personally ...i support it and stand in solidarity with Idle No More issues( protecting our waterways and resources) as well as Chief Theresa Spences issues of not living in third world conditions in one of the richest countrys in the world....
759912,manitoubass2,2013-01-17 05:26:00,11391,"In protest, you have to draw attention. When money controls everything, well, you basically disrupt the flow to have your issues addressed.  I must say I'm saddened by a few of these comments.  Out of any board, I would expect this one to be concerned and thoroughly active on issues regarding the environment.  Sorry your daughter was late to work irishfield.  Much bigger concerns here if you look at the bigger picture."
759913,manitoubass2,2013-01-17 05:28:00,11391, much respect...  same to a few others here for realizing the real issues at hand
