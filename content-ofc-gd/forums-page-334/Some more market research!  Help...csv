762963,TJQ,2013-01-27 16:55:00,7806,"Thanks guys... I think I'm going to go with some better quality ones.. They have a real variety of different ones.. Ill get the standard colours in for now and some samples of the funkier stuff to look at..  I had a bit of a setback this weekend, but im really hoping to go live by next weekend."
762969,Ralph Field,2013-01-27 17:42:00,1018,I'd add motor oil to your list and I use the more expensive ones.
762972,manitoubass2,2013-01-27 18:12:00,11391,"Kalins single tail are by far my favorite, in bluegill  I use alot of Yum grubs to, but my fave it black with a sliver, single tail"
762980,Steve,2013-01-27 19:29:00,2075,"the original ""bill"" from bills bait and tackle explained to me what gives the tail the best action.  where the body meets the tail, the narrower the connection, the better the action on the tail.  in the photo above, the connection point is almost as thick as the grub part - likely not great action.  narrower and thinner the connection point, better the action."
763414,jedimaster,2013-01-29 14:56:00,3472,If you can get a variety of deep blood red single tails I would buy a some. I keep looking but can never find the right color.
763492,JoshS,2013-01-29 18:46:00,729,I don't use them a ton but when I do it's generally a white or salt'n pepper single tail for walleye. Sometimes pumpkin/chatruese tail or smoke during the day. The key to a good grub is nimbleness!
762475,TJQ,2013-01-25 17:24:00,7806,So I'm getting inventory in  for the store.  Grubs for the jigs..  help me out here I don't want to order in stuff nobody will use...  If I missed a color lemme know.       
762477,adempsey,2013-01-25 17:29:00,1498,You should mention that you can choose more than one option.
762478,Acountdeleted,2013-01-25 17:29:00,2562,"I've heard it before and the more I fish the more I believe it, all you ever need is a chartruse jig."
762483,DRIFTER_016,2013-01-25 17:39:00,10439,I actually like the split double tails the best. With white being my best option and yellow second.  
762488,TJQ,2013-01-25 17:50:00,7806,Yes... you can choose more than one colour.
762489,John,2013-01-25 17:50:00,2956,"Single tail white, Single tail yellow. I probably have 2 or 3 hundred of every colour imaginable but these are the two that I'm always replacing."
762567,aplumma,2013-01-25 21:41:00,6896,I would add smoke too T.J.  Art
762572,John Bacon,2013-01-25 22:09:00,3277, That would be my favourite too.
762580,misfish,2013-01-25 23:10:00,29133,Pumpkin with gold flek..With what Dave posted.
762585,Leecher,2013-01-25 23:22:00,7832,"Single tail, chartreuse, black, yellow and white for this padr√©"
762589,bigugli,2013-01-25 23:34:00,6138,Gotta love smoke
762623,bigbuck,2013-01-26 00:28:00,2449,Chartreuse single tail and smoke single tail.
762624,irishfield,2013-01-26 00:30:00,26272,I've been ordering double tail for many many years... but always seem to get delivered singles! Oh well... it seems to work well!
762625,TJQ,2013-01-26 00:40:00,7806,Ok... I think ive got my answer... NOW  do you use cheap ones or expensive ones.....
762639,DRIFTER_016,2013-01-26 01:23:00,10439,I use inexpensive Cabelas ones when I get single tails and the Mr. Twister ones for my split double tails.  Now I tend to spend more $$$ when buying my tubes.
762640,Ron,2013-01-26 01:23:00,1683,I've been asking for a piece of tail for many many years and all i ever get is the end of the stick
762643,Joeytier,2013-01-26 01:28:00,3990,Single tail white...though I've never used the double tail versions before.  I almost always use Mister Twisters...great price for a high quality product.
762647,Rod Caster,2013-01-26 01:34:00,5784,"As long as its soft and gives good action,... Too many grubs have crappy action to them."
762653,adempsey,2013-01-26 01:41:00,1498,"I used to primarily use Gary Yamamoto and Kinami single tail grubs.  Slowly I've migrated over to Yum and Kalins.   They are cheaper and effective.  Even so, I really like the Yamamoto's a lot and still pick up a couple of my favorite colors - when I can find them.  Also, I stocked up on the Yum just before they reduced the package count down to 15 from 25.  So I have a ton of them, lol.  If I were to make grubs for sale, I'd make some unique colors.  Otherwise it's going to be hard to stand out."
762654,irishfield,2013-01-26 01:42:00,26272,I'm glad you clarified Chad...
762655,Muskieman,2013-01-26 01:50:00,2472,"You aren't missing a beat TJ ... quite the soldier you are , great job man !"
762656,mike rousseau,2013-01-26 01:54:00,4661,Scent is a must.... I've seen walleye reject un scented jigs over and over on the sonar.... Switch to a grub with some stink (Gulp) and those same fish are now biters....
762659,irishfield,2013-01-26 02:11:00,26272,I think he tried too hard with that one Art!
762663,Muskieman,2013-01-26 02:25:00,2472,Yep .. gonna lend a hand tomorrow .
762710,moxie,2013-01-26 05:23:00,1566,White or smoke single tail with silver or gold flake.
