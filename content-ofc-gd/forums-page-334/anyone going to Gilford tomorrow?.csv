762701,nancur373,2013-01-26 04:39:00,1211,Me and 2 buddies are heading up in the morning.  If you see this hut stop by and say hello. 
762708,moxie,2013-01-26 05:19:00,1566,Was thinking of heading out there but plans have changed as The Bay of Quinte calls. Looking forward to reading about how you guys fare. Good luck.
762816,d_paluch,2013-01-26 22:28:00,343,"haha figures, we (my girlfriend and I) were maybe 30 feet from you all day. Bite was tough but still a good day out, how was the fishing for you guys?"
762818,Christopheraaron,2013-01-26 22:33:00,3525,"How was it? (also, if anyone will be up tomorrow I'll be at VB towards Duclos)"
762825,d_paluch,2013-01-26 22:45:00,343,"bite was tough. Lots of bites but they were lite, we were using pan slammers and they were effective, but 2 guys beside us were catching non-stop with live minnows. Nothing big though. After talking to a few people, no one was getting the jumbos. Still a good day out there but it would have been nice to get some keepers"
762834,hombres4,2013-01-26 23:27:00,10,I have never fished Simcoe befores and have no hut. Are huts a must? Strong winds there??Thanks guys.
762838,Christopheraaron,2013-01-26 23:29:00,3525,"I'll be in the open tomorrow, most people go with huts but it's definitely not a must. there are some winds but nothing a good jacket won't fix"
762841,nancur373,2013-01-26 23:33:00,1211,"Lots of fish here too but all small. we caught probably 200 between 3 of us, not one jumbo. Mostly on live minnow. slab grabber got a few too"
762842,hombres4,2013-01-26 23:36:00,10,Thanks for the info. We are thinking of it giving it a try this winter very  soon. Can you bring salted minnows there?
762844,tbayboy,2013-01-26 23:51:00,1497,"Ditto here - LOADS of small ones only a few keepers (maybe a dozen between Lexxington and myself).  3 herring as well - those were kind of neat but I've seen enough 4"" perch to last me the rest of the winter  Certainly was a zoo out there today though - looked like the whole town of innisfil had been moved onto the ice and parking was nuts.  Also some great booming ice noises - got to watch a crack appear under my feet - that'll wake you up! (But ice was just building up - were on a solid 6 inches)  Ah well - beats sitting at home."
762848,nancur373,2013-01-26 23:58:00,1211,"we had a solid 11"""
762850,nancur373,2013-01-26 23:59:00,1211,heading out  again tomorrow or monday
762864,LeXXington,2013-01-27 01:20:00,1928,Non- stop action ok 98 % dinks... Minnows were hot but all the bigger ones I got came on artificials.  
762878,NAW,2013-01-27 02:04:00,4022,"We had some slow action for perch first thing in the morning.  Caught 8 in a our 30 minutes.  All 10 to 12"".  Headed out deep for white fish after that.  Few schools came buy.  Rolled one.  Nothing on the ice.  G-bay tomorrow."
762885,tapout,2013-01-27 02:57:00,166,I was out at Virginia Beach today.  Really thinking about heading there again tomorrow.   I found the jumbos.  I had consistent action all day and landed about 90 perch and at least 1/2 of them were jumbos. Maybe 10  - 15 of the total were under 8 inches.  Also 1 herring about 2 lb.  Everyone else I talked to said they were getting mostly dinks. Anyone else heading there tomorrow!
762889,Christopheraaron,2013-01-27 03:33:00,3525," Hey tapout, ill be at VB tomorrow if you wanted to hook up?"
762890,Christopheraaron,2013-01-27 03:34:00,3525,If your going text me: 647 328 9834
762924,Guest,2013-01-27 10:54:00,0,Just wondering how deep were you fishing.  Been out twice and the first time was at 20 feet and had about 20 keepers and the second time was around 23 feet and had 15 keepers.  I always like to stay on the outside of everyone not in the middle.  Good luck and that hut of yours is sweet.  Mines a whine setting it up in the wind.
762929,Rich,2013-01-27 12:22:00,3927,Heading to cooks Monday out of Gilford if anyone wants to meet up. First time out there.
762974,nancur373,2013-01-27 18:23:00,1211,"Rich, I'm taking my son there tomorrow.  Pm me your cell and we can hook up"
