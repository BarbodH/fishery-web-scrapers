763129,tomO,2013-01-28 14:39:00,363,Has any one ever shortened the wire running from your fish finder to the transducer and if so how?  thx.
763145,HTHM,2013-01-28 15:21:00,4082,By coiling it up and using 3 zip-ties to hold the coil. I don't think it can be done without causing problems with the readings.
763160,Fisherman,2013-01-28 15:43:00,7201,"It can be done.  If you're handy with a small soldering iron, get some shrink tube with internal glue.  Cut the cable about a foot from the connector to keep the joint above the waterline.   Trim back the out cable about 3/4 inch from each piece, don't cut the braid, next trim back about 1/4 inch of the center insulator.  Pre tin the wires,  slide the shrink tube over the center wire and slide a larger diameter piece over the outer sleeve.  Then solder the inner wire, shrink tube it, then solder the outer braid and shrink tube that.  I've done a couple for the boat about 5-6 years ago, still works fine."
763284,tomO,2013-01-28 23:31:00,363,Not sure if I feel that brave. Thought you might be able to cut the wire and just put plugs on both ends. Thx for your response I may try that.
763285,Terry,2013-01-28 23:42:00,14456,you can use metal insulated rca plugs to shorten the wire
763293,tomO,2013-01-29 00:15:00,363,"K thx Terry can i use the ones off the extra plugs from my tv  or vcr or stereo? Duh, I  just thought their sealed plugs already. I guess I can go to radio shack."
763295,Terry,2013-01-29 00:23:00,14456,the casing has to be all metal to maintain the shielded wire on both the male and female ends I would not use the cheaper plastic case ones
763669,camillj,2013-01-30 03:45:00,1988,ok ... the real question is .... why ?
