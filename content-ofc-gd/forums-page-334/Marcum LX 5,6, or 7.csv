763080,Sebastian,2013-01-28 04:02:00,208,Anyone have the LX 6 or 7? How is it? I've seen the 5 in action and its good but with a $200 difference im thinking of going all out with the 7. Any thoughts?
763200,Loadman,2013-01-28 17:44:00,63,I have the 7 and love it... used all top end models... I have had one problem with it and they fixed and sent back asap.... great unit and they constantly update it. Only issue is that it doesnt fit in a bucket
763211,Sebastian,2013-01-28 18:44:00,208,Thanks. I already bought the 7. The 6 looked like a nice size but i didnt like the handle. 7 has a nicer handle but its huge. Oh well. I cant wait to test it out.
