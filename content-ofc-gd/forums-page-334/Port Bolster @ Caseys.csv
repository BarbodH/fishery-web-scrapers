Called Caseys ( http://www.timeonthewater.ca/caseys_popup.html )on Simcoe Monday and had zero issues getting a hut for this past Saturday (26th). Went out with a buddy from work and his uncle. Between the 3 of us we landed about 70 perch a 3 hearing. Havent been to Simcoe in many moons, but will be heading back hopefully before ice out. Aprox 8-10"" of ice about a kilometer or so straight out from Port Bolster. To be honest alot of dinks 6"" or so and some keepers 8-9"". My I was able to land a 12"" jumbo which was cool. Conservation Officers were out in full force as well. They stoped in and asked us for licenese and what not..all was cool. We got great servic from Caseys and would use them again. Argo ride out and back as well as a few checks throughout the day. I recomende them. hopefully the pics come out as Im computer stupid. Thanks for looking Pidge.        "

763327,pidge,2013-01-29 01:41:00,438,"Thanks guys for lookin! Beans I'd be lying if I told you what it was. He told us it was 20 years old or so and had only use it a few times before. I've seen them at crapp tire and fishing stores before, but dont know what they call it. I could of sworn he was reeling in reverse to what you'd normally reel and it had 2 sensativity (what I'd call it) guides. Good eye Beans lol."
