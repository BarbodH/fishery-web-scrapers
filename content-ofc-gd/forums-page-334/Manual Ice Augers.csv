762565,BillM,2013-01-25 21:32:00,17367,"I make sure once the hole is drilled the guard goes back on the Fin-Bore III.   It's so easy to dull/destroy those blades.  I'm on my third season with a lot of holes drilled, still cuts through ice like butter!"
762586,misfish,2013-01-25 23:23:00,29133," Exactly. Drill the hole and put the guard back on. Dont drill a half hole for it to stand in. Thats KILLER to the blades. On those colder days,dont just lay it down. The water will freeze on the blades and do the same damage."
762602,Leecher,2013-01-25 23:48:00,7832,"I'm the odd ball here... purchased a Walmart special 4 - 5 years ago (Sub Zero 6"") may be more, can't remember and it still going strong    Like others mention... don't bang the blades or you're looking for a workout  I used to own an 8"" one, can't remember the make... was a CTC special, blue shaft with red handles and didn't last long    now with the 6"" find it much easier and really don't need bigger for the species of fish I target"
762823,Acountdeleted,2013-01-26 22:42:00,2562,Bought a 6 inch finbore III today. Thanks for all the advice everyone. Now I just need some free time to get out and use it.
762912,porkpie,2013-01-27 04:41:00,2521,"I am surprised to hear that folks have had such poor luck with the Nils cutting head.  I have had mine for many seasons now, with thousands of holes cut and it is running strong!  It is a 6 inch.  I don't let others use it though, and the guard goes on as soon as I am done drilling!  It is actually the auger that caused me to give up my gas auger.  I find I can fit most anything I need to through a 6 inch hole, although I don't fish lakers a whole lot anymore, I am sure a real hog would give me trouble!  Anyway... Different strokes!  At $50 I am going to see if my local Costco has any on sale!  I could always use a backup!!"
759865,Rod Caster,2013-01-17 02:34:00,5784,Try calling the manufacturer: Also the best place to get blades.  Normark 
759874,pike slayer,2013-01-17 02:49:00,1177,"i have the normark auger that rod caster posted. 3-4years ago i was looking for that auger and couldnt find it anywhere. one day i was in the local tackle shop and there was one sitting on the desk. i asked the if it was for sale and he said sure but it was the last one of his stock and it was bought and returned and the guy said it didnt work. the blades were all chewed up, the guy must have drilled into a rock first hole and returned it. The guy at the tackle shop called the manufacture and said there is zero left and its a discontinued item but they do still sell replacement blades for it and sent me a free set. so i bought it for a discounted price put the new blades on it and works amazing! so good luck finding one unless some store in Florida accidently got one sent to them and its been sitting there for years. i wouldnt sell mine for $1000!the old mora swede bore are bullet proof augers. before the normark i used one for years and its fallen off the back of my sled and taken a beating. i even lost a blade and it still cut with one blade!ohhh and if anyone would like a folding 10"" mora manual auger from the early 90's i got one. that beast will keep you warm all day out on the ice!"
760079,castgame,2013-01-17 18:13:00,161,"the bass pro cheap-o is a terrible machine... everything's falling apart after a dozen or so uses. plastic wing nut snapped in the cold (seriously guys? couldn't use a less temperature sensitive material?), the blade guard cracked immediately, and the blades themselves are a very cheap steel. you get what you pay for i know, but this is still a very disappointing piece of gear. good luck getting bps to take it back though!"
760122,Acountdeleted,2013-01-17 20:00:00,2562,"Meh, it lasted me a season, and got me into ice fishing. Now with all the other gear I have bought this just seems like the next natural progression........ or a Quad."
760134,buick14,2013-01-17 20:38:00,741,"Wow I didnt know it was a Nils available.....  I have absolutely no experience with this new orange nils, (I have the blue shaft with the red blade), but if its the same auger, Id buy a few if I had a costco membership.....again not sure if its the same as the the blue one I have, but if it is?........WHAT A STEAL BUY MANY"
760135,buick14,2013-01-17 20:44:00,741," lol good auger is one of the most important components..... Dont waste your money on a quad, buy a 3 wheeler for next to nothing, and drive it only in a straight line or you will die.  Love you bud."
760151,manjo39,2013-01-17 21:34:00,354,Are replacement blades easy to find for the NILS?
760366,buick14,2013-01-18 16:14:00,741,"lololololololololololololololololololololololololololololololololololololololololololololololololo  Sorry about that.  As of 2 years ago, lololol no wayyyyy.  Maybe things have changed with their new augers etc, but the blue body and red head were very tough (impossible locally).  Anything can be sourced online, but obviously at a price."
760374,BassAsin,2013-01-18 16:42:00,806,"augers are on sale at ct right now, either fin or swede bore normark augers. been using one for years no issues.    either way  do yourself a favour and put vaseline on the blades during the off season.   and often wal mart will have major clear out sales on ice fishing stuff come spring, blades go on as cheap as 10 bucks a set. keep a spare set handy incase you find a rock or stone just under the ice."
760386,manjo39,2013-01-18 17:27:00,354,"I search CT online, but did not see any augers on sale.  Their flyer states ice fishing stuff is on sale but doesn't mention specifics."

760458,misfish,2013-01-18 21:55:00,29133,"Ok heres the facts on that auger at Costco.  Ya it,s a Nils. BUT,It is marked Nils/Usa. The drill attachment,is built right on the auger. Now for the blade part. It is the one piece insert,BUT,very primitive looking. I see no good coming from that blade. It,s nothing like the ones made before. LAZER sharp it aint. Looks like it was sharpen with a hand grinder. There is an advert on the box that says, made in Sweden since 1950.  For some reason I cant down load the pics on my cell."
760562,Dabluz,2013-01-19 03:26:00,701,"I've got an 8 or 9 inch manual auger.  I don't know the manufacturer.  It is the model where only one handle turns, the other is in direct line with the auger.  I've been using it for over 30 years.  I bought a second pair of blades for it a couple of years after buying the auger.  I have been sharpening the blades myself ever since then.  Don't use it much anymore because the ice where I do most of my icefishing rises and falls with the tides and picks up sand from the bottom at low tide.  Just one grain of sand and the auger is finished for the day.  I mostly use an ice chisel and when the ice gets thick, I re-open old holes to save work because the ice gets over 2 feet thick."

760590,porkpie,2013-01-19 10:59:00,2521,"Me too.  I think the Newmarket Costco was selling them before Christmas with a drill adapter included for something around $100.  Truly an awesome auger.  I got mine shortly after they hit the market, and have zero regrets!"
760865,welderman44,2013-01-20 11:41:00,3,"If possible buy an auger with a replaceable tip as it's the tip that will get damaged make drilling near impossible, you can have sharp new blades but a bent tip gets you no where."
760893,buick14,2013-01-20 14:27:00,741,"Aside from the old ghetto spoon type augers, I think all have replaceable heads or blades... But some at a cost..."
761140,GYPSY400,2013-01-21 03:25:00,191,"I just bought one today at the Costco in Sudbury for $49.97 ( it was $99.99 before Christmas ) tried it out in 12"" ice.. Took less than 20 seconds, and no jamming when breaking through.. I've never used an auger so easy and quick!! Once I charge my drill up, I'll see how that works too, but it's not needed."
761872,Sinker,2013-01-23 18:57:00,8692,"I've had them all. Nils, more, swedebore, and fin-bore.  I use the fin bore.  The nils was great for 3 seasons, then needed blades, and I couldn't find them anywhere. When I did find them, buying a new fin bore was cheaper. I haven't looked back.  S."
761873,Sinker,2013-01-23 18:59:00,8692,"Oh, I have an 8"" mora here if anyone wants it. Needs blades, but its yours if you want to come get it. I'm 15mins south of ptbo, just off hwy 115.  S."
762084,GYPSY400,2013-01-24 11:21:00,191,"I have to agree on the nils blades.. If I'm lucky I can buy from their website, but I think I will have to sharpen them myself.. It still works awesome when it's new though!!"
762209,Sinker,2013-01-24 20:23:00,8692,"^ So does the fin bore 3. Good luck getting blades that are supposed to be lifetime.....that's another story.  My Nils was a 6"", and my finbore is an 8"". I find no difference. I had a hard time changing from a mora/swedebore style auger to the nils/finbore, only because I was used to that design for over 20 years, and could drill holes like a machine. The finbore is the same now though, just cuts like butter.  Most guys problems with augers are their own fault. They damage them without even knowing it. They have to be razor sharp, and turned properly in order to work the best. Taking care of them once the holes are drilled is equally important. I don't let many people use mine, but I will drill anyone a hole with it, no problem.  S."
762210,davey buoy,2013-01-24 20:29:00,5505,"That sounds just like me,treat it right,last a lifetime. I use to drill holes for anyone as well.Wasn't so much the cost,kinda,but one wrong careless bit of handling it's toast.When they cut well,hardly any work at all.!"
762531,chris f.,2013-01-25 19:44:00,95,"lol..i'm the same way.. i have 2 - 8"" hand augers, one is a swede-bore and the other is a normark. both worked great for the first 3 seasons, then the normark took the lead because of the blade issue. then i got new blades, and they were equal again til one of my buddy's horsed it too much and bent the tip on the swede-bore  now i drill all the holes lol  nothing beats the old 10"" jiffy tho, but the fact remains the same.. take good care of your gear, and it will last a lifetime. i'm still using my dads tip ups with the same line on them from 20 years ago"
762533,Acountdeleted,2013-01-25 19:50:00,2562,"I'm using my same tip ups too and probably will be for the rest of my life, but thats because they don't catch fish."
759541,Acountdeleted,2013-01-15 20:50:00,2562,"Last year, when I was first getting into ice fishing I went out and bought a bass pro brand ice auger, figuring the 8 inch was only a few bucks more I decide to go with that (oops). In my second year, the handles have been falling apart, last week I lost one of the screws holding the blades and have noiced its been off and on for cutting.  Today when picking up replacement blades I was looking at the fancy $100 finebore III lazer sharp 'cuts the hole for you and even catches the fish for you' ice auger and was wondering, is this all a ploy to get you to spend more money or is it really worth saving up my extra pennies and buying a top of the line manual auguer?  I'm not going to get a gas powered auger because I don't have the room to hold it or bring it out on the ice and to be honest, I kinda like the exercise. But has anyone noticed a difference in the manual ones?"
759544,moxie,2013-01-15 20:55:00,1566,"Upgraded from an 8"" SwedeBore to a 6"" Finbore. As soon as I find the 8"" on sale I'm buying the 8"" as well. 14"" of ice like butter."
759545,davey buoy,2013-01-15 20:56:00,5505,"Not sure about the finbore,but my mora sweden 8"",has cut loads and loads of holes over the past 25 years. Still cuts like a knife through butter. The key is to put the guard right back on when hole is done Any brand name should work well."
759551,Reelaction,2013-01-15 21:04:00,33,Absolute biggest thing with a manual auger. Never ever bang them on the ice. Damage the blade or the angle they cut at and it's game over. You will melt the ice faster than you cut it.  Finbore has also been a great auger for me.
759561,adempsey,2013-01-15 21:14:00,1498,"I have a Finbore III 6"" as well.  Works great for me.  My buddy has some 8"" models as well, both the collapsible and the standard one (might be Mora, not sure).   They all work great.   However, it's really all about taking care of your blades.  I dry mine off after every trip and spray them with some cooking oil.   Definitely try not to bang them around as mentioned.  I prefer fishing out of 8"" (or even 12"") holes, but I prefer cutting 6"" holes =)"
759564,misfish,2013-01-15 21:18:00,29133,And dont leave them in a partially drilled hole..   Finbor 3 all the way.
759567,Acountdeleted,2013-01-15 21:20:00,2562,"The blades are still holding out well for the unit, for the most part, its more so all the other stuff thats falling apart. I read online that I should put some locktite around the bolts holding the blades on for the BP auger so that doesn't happen again. Makes sense but then it will be hard to get the blades off when I need to replace them.  I like the idea of the cooking oil to keep the water off. I'll have to remember that...... or maybe turtle wax."
759569,SylvanOwner,2013-01-15 21:23:00,266,"What Sinclair said, the offset handles make a HUGE difference."
759577,davey buoy,2013-01-15 21:33:00,5505,"Get yourself a small tube of removeable loctite. Vibration will not loosen them,but a good crank on the bolt will ."
759581,misfish,2013-01-15 21:45:00,29133," And all you have to do is just turn the auger. No down force required. Like he said,cuts the ice like butter"
759583,Court R,2013-01-15 21:48:00,213,Best auger I have ever used
759588,Rod Caster,2013-01-15 22:22:00,5784,"Only hand auger I'll need to own; I've had it for over 6 years and beat the heck out of it. I found a cheap supply of blades (manufacturer in Oshawa) so I'm set for a while.    Your auger shouldn't fall apart like that Jer. For the cost it'll take to fix it, maybe consider buying a different unit. The Finbore Micro 6' above sells for about $100 in stores."
759593,Joeytier,2013-01-15 22:54:00,3990,Finbores...like everyone else has mentioned above is definitely the way to go.
759600,Acountdeleted,2013-01-15 23:06:00,2562,I just found my other bass pro gift cards. Looks like I have some shopping to do later this week.
759644,chefboi17,2013-01-16 03:22:00,128,"If anyone actually finda a place that has a finbore micro I would love to get another one, word is they are discontinued by normark."

759672,Guest,2013-01-16 10:38:00,0,Good advice guys.  Thanks for the tips on how to maintain my auger.  I used to use it as a spud.  Just joking
759677,phatpelkey,2013-01-16 11:37:00,78,nils master hands down the best auger iv ever used or tried
759679,misfish,2013-01-16 12:20:00,29133,The Nils and Finbor. Same design.Big spooned blades.
759682,buick14,2013-01-16 12:52:00,741,"Nils master is THE BEST HANDS DOWN manual ice auger you can get.  The price will also reflect that.  Its a self sharpening blade so long as you take care of it itll last forever.  Pretty much no downward pressure needed: itll walk through the hole like a 4X4 in low climbing a small hill.  Man I am telling you, they are hands down the best fastest easiest (and most expensive) manual.  Worth the extra $$, but damn hard to find locally.  If you slam it down and detune the blades, youre in trouble.  I found a guy in the US off iceshanty who was actually able to sharpen and retune my cutting bit.....but apparently its rare to find someone who will guarantee their work.  BUY A NILS MASTER"
759683,Jer,2013-01-16 12:54:00,1426,"I saw this one at the local Costco the other day:  http://www.costco.ca/NILSUSA-Convertible-Hand-Auger.product.100002405.html  Was only $100 in the store, looks like a nice unit, easily converts for power drill."
759686,Rod Caster,2013-01-16 12:56:00,5784,"Never used a Nils Master but they sound like a good unit.  As far as sharpening goes, for the finbore blades, just throw them out and buy new. First off it's not worth sharpening, as new blades can be bought just as cheap, and secondly, sharpening will never bring them to new quality."
759687,buick14,2013-01-16 13:00:00,741,nils isnt supposed to need sharpening...its supposed to be selfsharpening lifetime...but incase you detune it on the ice........
759774,davey buoy,2013-01-16 20:52:00,5505,I also think the rough abuse after the holes done is what hurts most augers.Take a little bit of care they'll last for years!
759864,nancur373,2013-01-17 02:25:00,1211,"I got a 8"" finbore at a garage sale 5 years ago for $0.50. Put a new set of blades on it and good to go. I must say...the off-set handles are the cats   . Does anyone have an 8"" guard they can get rid of?"
