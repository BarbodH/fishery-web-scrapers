763259,manjo39,2013-01-28 21:37:00,354,"Hi All,  I'm considering a Loomis 6'6 SJR782 IMX (new, waiting for the rod trade in at BPS) or the Bronzeback SMR 752S-SP 6'3"" (BPS does not have this in stock). Would be using the rod for Walleye (jerkbaits, jigs) and Bass (jerkbaits, skipping, shakey-head, dropshotting).  I'm a short guy and want a shorter rod (vs. 7' and above).  I like the bronzeback foregrip/handle better than the IMX, but am not convinced in the blank quality/sensitity vs the IMX and would be able to get the IMX at the rod trade in.  I'm also considering a Dobyns based on reviews, but they are very hard to find in a brick and mortar store and I haven't felt one in my hand, which is mandatory for me before I buy.  Does anyone have any suggestions/comments of a similar rod to the Loomis IMX? (I am not a St. Croix guy).  "
763261,jedimaster,2013-01-28 21:41:00,3472,"I have found all of my loomis rods to feel tip heavy, so if you like to keep your tip low they are good. All of the expensive rods will provide good feedback, I would highly suggest you go to a shot that will let you put a spooled reel onto the rod and feel how it feels for balance."
763265,Guest,2013-01-28 21:56:00,0,"Im a short guy too and I prefer a 6'6"" spinning rod.  Also if I were you I would grab a medium light action rod if you are mostly using it for walleye and bass."
763267,jedimaster,2013-01-28 21:58:00,3472,I would take a look at the cumulus rods they are super light and very very sensitive.
763272,musky_hunter,2013-01-28 22:09:00,328,"Checkout the Rapala Concept Ti. I have the 6'8"" and it's sweet.  I've use many expensive rods and this spinning rod is great deal. I'm comparing to NRX, GLX, Zbone, DX, and Steez."
763277,young_one,2013-01-28 22:57:00,620,"the 783, a version heavier than the 782 has been my go to rod for many years!"
763290,bare foot wader,2013-01-29 00:05:00,1354," I have 3 culumuls rods and love them, Ti guides and I hear they are built on a loomis glx blank....but you are paying about 150 bucks just for the Ti guides  take a look at the 2013 cumara rods, designed for bass, a few shorter models for work fishing, built on the same blank as the discontiued cumulas minus the Ti guides, it has K concept guides which I'm interested to try out  on par price with the other rods you're looking at"
763404,manjo39,2013-01-29 14:26:00,354,"  Thanks for the feedback.  That is why I am considering the Dobyns.  The review compared similar rods including Loomis and stated that it was the most balanced.  Just don't know where I can feel one in my hand with a reel attached before buying.    Thanks, I'm on the fence between buying a 6'3"" MH and a 6'8"" M or ML vs. just one 6'6""   I was also considering the cumulus and cumara, but basspro doesn't carry them.  Do you know where I can find them?   I also agree with this, but I would have to get two rods MH for jerkbaits and a M or ML for lighter applications.  Trying to get away with just one rod.  Maybe I will have come down in price range and get two rods.   I do have a Rapala Shift Baitcast rod and like it.  Haven't seen the Concept Ti in the store.   Do you know who carry's them?   What do you use the 783 rod for?  I think it may be a little too heavy for Walleye jigging.   Do you know who in the GTA carries the cumara?"
763411,jedimaster,2013-01-29 14:51:00,3472,"I also have a cumara and a cumulus. The cumara are reall great buys, sensitive, good warrranty and wow are they ever light. I like it far above my loomis gl2, but I think a heavier reel on the loomis would make a big difference. They used to sell them at JB's Fishing Depot near martin grove and 401, not too sure where else I have seen them. I think the cumara's shortest setup is 6'8"" a very good overall length. I use a 6' st.croix for skipping or when I am working in tight cover, a 6'6"" for jerk baits, otherwise all of my other rods are all 7' or longer. The longer rods take some getting used to but they do offer some benefits. More power setting the hook, a bit more casting distance, I find them easier to control a big fish near the boat and big bass(the 5+ pounders) don't run under the boat as far as they do with a shorter rod.  I think over all I would say I am a shimano guy but the warranty issues I have had in previous years hae started to push me away to St.Croix There was a time when all I had was Loomis or Shimano, but now my St.Croix's outnumber my shimano's"
763412,bigmac1984,2013-01-29 14:52:00,193,"I believe fishing world in Hamilton has some good stock on Dobyns rods that you can see at a store, check out their website and give the store a call just to make sure."
763467,musky_hunter,2013-01-29 17:40:00,328,Pro j carries dobyns. For rapala concept ti checkout sail.
763676,2jack2,2013-01-30 05:05:00,92,"Sail carries a few model of Concept Ti rod. the new Cumara is not in yet but should be in stock very soon. You should also check out the old style Cumara, they should go on Clearance soon."
763703,Rich,2013-01-30 13:05:00,3927,That's certainly a matter of opinion.
763709,esoxcrazy,2013-01-30 13:34:00,22,"I have been using the Crucial 6'8"" Med with x-fast tip for Jigging and jerkbaits for the last 3 years and have yet to find a suitable replacement."
763713,Rich,2013-01-30 13:51:00,3927,"Lol, I hope that was a pun cuz thats certainly how I read it.  In truth, I personally find a stiff rod can rip the three trebles out more than help.. but my dad is the opposite and has used a telephone pole for jerkbaiting for years. We both catch fish."
763722,Rich,2013-01-30 14:16:00,3927,Jerkbaiting for smallies is so 1998
763734,Rich,2013-01-30 14:45:00,3927,I hear ya man. Senkos are like using live worms. I was jk.. i just dont fish smallies that often. When a largie hits a jerk they usually nip the side or roll on it and the hooks can and will pull out. I was more referring to largies. Pike too. Pike tend to miss a lot.
763792,young_one,2013-01-30 17:54:00,620,I use the rod for Kawartha eyes in the spring and Quinte eyes in the fall. - ripping bucktails - jerkbait - lipless crank - slow retrieve swimbaits - weeded area for senko bass fishing
