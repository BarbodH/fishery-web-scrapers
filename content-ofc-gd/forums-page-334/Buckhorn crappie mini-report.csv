Funny thing about this pic...my wife took it from our dock at about 300 yards with a 24x zoom lens. The far shoreline is probably at least a mile and a half beyond us, well beyond any safe ice for my truck, but it looks like we're only a few hundred yards in front of it.  The day was a bust fish-wise, with only enough dink perch to keep us occupied.  Sunday afternoon we gave Chemong a try for a few hours with even worse results.  The winter crappie bite seems to be an evening thing around here, with usually only a short window at dusk. I got out tonight, but not until almost 5:30 when it was almost dark. I got one hole set-up and was busy with my second line when I looked back and had a fish on the first...    Unfortunately, it was my only bite of the night...I musta just caught the end of the window. I really need to get home from work earlier.  Anyways, it bodes well for the next 5 or 6 weeks...lotsa ice and every day getting longer... "

763374,Jer,2013-01-29 10:54:00,1426,"Thanks for your concern regarding my truck, but it's hardly at risk. The ice we were on has been a consistant sheet since mid-December and is now over 12"" of black, clear ice.  Both myself and my fishing partner don't walk particularly well, so being able to take the truck is a blessing. We also have a wooden floor made up for the pop-up that's a little bit heavy to be dragging by hand but fits right in the bed of the truck."
763379,moxie,2013-01-29 12:34:00,1566,Good  to hear you got out. The Crappie will bite long after the sun has gone down as long as you move around and work them a little more than usual.
763383,fishindevil,2013-01-29 12:52:00,6254,great report thanks for sharing !!! you will get into them big time sooner or later...
