762587,4x4bassin,2013-01-25 23:25:00,1025,"On my way into Alliston today I spotted 2 bald eagles in a tree , went back home to grab the camera and to my surprise they were still there . Couldn't get close at all but managed a couple pictures .          I'm not to sure if you can spot them but there are two bald eagles in this picture below , surprisingly they are quite easy to spot in the wild due to there size and colour     They were pretty big with a wing span of at least 6 feet , a real beautiful creature to say the least . Location was 20km NW of Alliston in Dufferin county , I will keep my eyes open for the next couple months and try to get more pictures. "
762591,Kawartha Kev,2013-01-25 23:35:00,281,Nice pics and beautiful birds. Is the last pic a kind of where's Waldo game? LOL!!
762594,Christopheraaron,2013-01-25 23:36:00,3525,Nice! I think I can see them in the last one
762611,jedimaster,2013-01-26 00:07:00,3472,Gotcha!!!  
762622,Burtess,2013-01-26 00:24:00,901,"Nice!  Back in the summer I spotted one flying over York Rd. in Dundas and almost crashed the van... all I could say was ""bald eagle"" over and over again... the kids and wife were not as impressed as I  I had never seen one in the ""wild"" before so it was quite exciting for me (and in Dundas as well!!).  Burt"
762631,Christopheraaron,2013-01-26 01:05:00,3525,"Good, wasn't sure if that was the second one on the left or not."
762649,NAW,2013-01-26 01:37:00,4022,"Nice!  Last fall I saw two together across from my house.  Thought it was so amazing.  30 seconds later, my wife phones me and told me she just got a positive reading on a pregnancy test (after trying for over 2 years).  Very cool day."
762661,johndox,2013-01-26 02:18:00,54,A couple of weeks ago the MNR gave permission to have one of their nest removed to make room for the windmills that are going in around Fisherville.  What a shame!
762699,danc,2013-01-26 04:38:00,4677,I saw about 20 or 30 of them in the past week. Ho hum....
762717,lew,2013-01-26 09:09:00,12766," Bald Eagles are common in some parts of Ontario but rare in other parts Dan, so sometimes seeing them is a big deal.  Don't really think comments such as ""Ho hum"" are really called for, specially from a moderator, when someone takes the time to share something with the members."
762719,davey buoy,2013-01-26 11:08:00,5505,"I don'y know if the predatory bird populations are up,but I have noticed it's not uncommon to see at least 5 hawks or more in the bare trees on the Toronto to Barrie run in the afternoons.Nice pics 4x4bassin!!!!!!!!!!!!"
762745,mr blizzard,2013-01-26 14:55:00,1589,"X2 People who are on this board enjoy  any or all aspects of fishing hunting and photography. I believe we all enjoy nature and the outdoors. When someone takes the time to share some of their experiences it should be encouraged, thats what makes this board  what it is.  . Blizz"
762784,4x4bassin,2013-01-26 18:05:00,1025,"Thanks guys , I knew you guys would find them  ."
762788,Twocoda,2013-01-26 19:17:00,4130,For anyone wanting the opportunity to capture images of Bald Eagles ....Bae Du Dore just north of the Bruce Nuclear plant is great spot to see them....there are about 30 birds that will be living there for the duration of the winter as they can fish from the warm outflow of the Nuke Plant...at the boat launch just off to the left is an elevated Bird Watching Platform....Dress Warm because of the west winds comming off the lake and bring a large lens and youll grab some amazing shots ....If you dont have a large lens you can put in the foot work and get some shots....kinda like fishing where you just might get lucky and capture a prize.. Cheers! edit to add...nice shots 4x4....thanks for sharing
762790,Rod Caster,2013-01-26 19:26:00,5784,Go to the Wolf Lake landfill in Nipissing Township.... it's littered with....litter. And typically a few bald eagles too
762799,Lukasaurus,2013-01-26 21:00:00,19,"I saw my first ones last summer while camping on the french river. This morning I saw one in a tree close to Drayton. Way cool. Last winter I saw a snowy owl, near Drayton as well. I didn't know they would come this far south, but this one did."
762813,ChrisK,2013-01-26 22:23:00,2772,"A juvenile bald eagle almost made off with my dog two years ago at camp. He swooped down to snag my dog but my wife got herself close enough to scare him off in the nick of time.  My dogs name is Waldo,go figure"
762899,ehg,2013-01-27 03:56:00,2666,Great to see Bald Eagles making a big comeback into southern Ontario. Thanks for the pictures.
762966,SirWhite,2013-01-27 17:27:00,210,"That is fantastic, I've never seen a Bald Eagle in Ontario!"
762975,BruceCfisher86,2013-01-27 18:26:00,49,"I agree, seeing a bald eagle(especially for your first time) is a surreal sight! I worked at bruce nuclear and would see 6 to 12 a day, sometimes in full on wars over the outflow feeding on shad, so the excitement isn't there as much. But still seeing a bald eagle is something you'll always remember and a pretty special moment in my opinion!"
762976,BruceCfisher86,2013-01-27 18:27:00,49,Cool Pics!
763032,Rizzo,2013-01-28 00:45:00,4754,beauty shots. When we moved to KW last month I saw one flying over the grand river...couldn't believe it. Same thing as someone else has posted...my wife was far less impressed
