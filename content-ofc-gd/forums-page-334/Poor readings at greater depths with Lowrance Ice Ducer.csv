So much more convenient than ""the stick"", however, I was a bit disappointed with my depth readings below 40 feet. I tried increasing the sensitivity, and, although the jig showed up better...the interference, background noise negated any positives. Any tips or suggestions would be appreciated. I was fishing 62-65 feet of water, and, the unit is a Lowrance X100C.  Cheers, Frank"
763210,bare foot wader,2013-01-28 18:39:00,1354,not familiar with that model for ice fishing....can you adjust your target separation?
763231,farsider,2013-01-28 20:11:00,456,"Were you fishing nearby someone else with a fishfinder?  The deeper you fish, the further apart fellow anglers have to fish to eliminate interference.  Cheers, Mark"
763233,irishfield,2013-01-28 20:15:00,26272,Frank.. I use my 102C and it was a nightmare to get set up correctly. Anything above about 90% sensitivity and my screen will actually go solid black.  Turn the sensitivity down.. ping speed to 25% (you're not moving.. unless you're on Erie maybe...). And just keep playing with settings 'till it gets better.  Considering ice this year (other than for NWT Dave)... I probably don't have to say make sure the transducer is below the ice..
763242,asdve23rveavwa,2013-01-28 20:50:00,2690,"Thanks, guys.  I had another suggestion from someone that asked if I had noise reduction on the unit.  I downloaded the old manual for it, and, looks like I do.  Has three settings, low, medium and high...as well as off....so hoping that with some more playing around/fine tuning, she should be reading the way I want it to. Just need this mild weather to take a hike so I can get back out there."
763279,irishfield,2013-01-28 23:09:00,26272,"Yes Frank... noise reduction.. mine has an upper .. generally set to medium or high.. and a  lower, generally set to low or medium"
763320,Sinker,2013-01-29 01:10:00,8692,Noise reduction off  It sounds like you were getting interference from another unit. Were there other fisherman nearby?  I set my upper/lower limits to see the water I'm fishing as well. Clears the picture up. Then split screen it so you can see the whole water column.  S.
763324,asdve23rveavwa,2013-01-29 01:25:00,2690,"Was just checking it out. Found all the settings and the surface reduction was off, the noise was on low.  Set them both to medium. Ready for some fine tuning out on the ice!!"
763328,Slop,2013-01-29 01:46:00,151,"I'm not 100% sure that unit has an 'upper and lower limits' feature in the menu/pages but if it does you may solve your issue there. If for instance, you are fishing 65' then set the lower to 65' and the upper to say 30'. Your lure should mark in that bottom 35' like a charm but you will lose the top 30' feet of the water column for viewing your lure and fish.  I use this feature often when fishing in 100' feet of water with smaller baits. I'll set the upper limits to 70' and the lower to 100' The lure and fish are easily visible on the screen."
763330,Sinker,2013-01-29 01:56:00,8692,"Yeah, what slop said. Mine will split screen as well, so I can watch the bottom depth I choose, and also the wgole water column.  S."
763332,Sinker,2013-01-29 01:59:00,8692,"Also keep in mind the ice ducer has a much narrower cone, so of there was any current, or your spoon fluttered off to the side of your hole, you will lose it Out of the cone.  S."
763335,asdve23rveavwa,2013-01-29 02:03:00,2690,All good points guys. Thanks!
763338,Moosebunk,2013-01-29 02:24:00,3970,Was gonna say it... but then Slop did... and then Sinker did too. lol.
