Already have a couple of rods...Excited to get out there! Anyways we're deciding between 3 spots close to home (Hamilton) - Binbrook (back of the lake), Harbour/Pier 4 or Coots Paradise. I was driving on 403 today and saw people scating on Coots so thats a good sign. Ice safety is number one concern; would ice thinkness be the same everwhere? Would also like to catch something but dont want to risk out lives.  So safety and best potential catch in mind where would you go?"
762908,dhickey,2013-01-27 04:23:00,1038,If there is any question DONT GO... ice fishing is a brutal game of knowlage and patience.  Stay safe. Saltydawg.
762911,Guest,2013-01-27 04:40:00,0,Stay around other guys that are ice fishing
762922,pics,2013-01-27 10:38:00,1268,Binbrook is still closed to all ice fishing and coots freezes right to the bottom because it's so shallow.....your only option appears to be bayfront park provided the ice is safe. If it is safe there will be others there to learn from...
762925,Rich,2013-01-27 11:51:00,3927,"I'd do bayfront, for the simple fact that it's your best chance at a fish. Provided it's safe. It should be, but obviously be cautious."
762936,Christopheraaron,2013-01-27 13:50:00,3525,"ice is NOT the same everywhere, any variances in the water below can change the quality of ice. If you're unsure drill lots of holes and at least wear a life jacket. I would probably say your best shot would be little lake in cambridge."
762946,hotsky,2013-01-27 14:42:00,400,  I was thinking back of the lake which is not part of the the concervation area but it's pretty shalow there...
763075,pics,2013-01-28 03:36:00,1268,Even the back part is owned by the conservation authority but it's very shallow.....I've never seen much caught from there....
763079,hotsky,2013-01-28 03:54:00,400,"I ended up going to the Pier 4 today for a couple of hours, would've stayed longer but my friend started complaining he was cold lol. Didn't catch anything but still had fun standing on top of (23ft of) water for the first time. Ice was about 5"" where I was. Saw people skating way out there and a couple of people ice saling hundreds of meters from shore - I wouldn't go that far if you paid me!"
763081,Guest,2013-01-28 04:10:00,0,I wonder if you can troll with an ice sail.  You might have to drill a few holes.
