763591,tb4me,2013-01-29 23:48:00,3295,"/\ /\ /\ /\ Lol never a dull moment. Anyway I'm not going to bother with the restricted as I'm not a fan of hand guns.. Also promised the wife I wouldn't get into them. She wasn't a big fan of guns in the house to begin with. I had to promise that not only will trigger locks be used but all guns will be locked away in a safe and Ammo stored in a locked box separate from the guns. I have no problem with that what so ever. I take the federal minimum as a just that , a minimum. One can never be to safe with kids around.."
763680,2jack2,2013-01-30 05:13:00,92,Congrats! I am going for the PAL course this weekend.
763705,BillM,2013-01-30 13:16:00,17367," Enjoy it! Perfect way to spend 2 days especially with this weather..   I had some characters in my course, the kind that would make you think shouldn't be allowed to carry a firearm, lol!"
763768,tb4me,2013-01-30 15:53:00,3295,"Funny you should mention that Bill..There were 2 in my class that scared the hell out of me..One was a female Police officer here in town.. She was ""Prove""ing a loaded 12 gauge stared right down the barrel..Also she couldn't figure out the safety on the lever action rifles without actually firing off the dummy round. I was surprised that a Police officer doesn't have to have their non restricted licences. Thank god for dummy rounds eh..The other guy couldn't learn to keep his finger off the trigger..He ironically enough was the only person to fail the course.."
763770,tb4me,2013-01-30 15:57:00,3295,"Awesome, go learn..You will do good and enjoy it.. My instructor is also the local gun smith here in town. Very smart man and an exellent teacher..His name is Wayne Miller his comany name in shurefire gun repair here in Brantford for anyone looking to sign up around here"
763818,ch312,2013-01-30 19:18:00,1590,"  lol...kinda like you were doing to me last year for a short time?  besides, that was supposed to say ""why?"" rather than ""and?"". you can thank the new phone and T9 for that one.   just an FYI...a restricted license is not only for handguns, but other restricted long guns as well.   i agree that you can never be too safe with firearms.  PM me if you'd like to go hunting or shooting sometime. i'm taking another newly licensed guy next week (IF we have snow) to show him the ropes if you'd like to tag along for some rabbits and some skeet shooting"
763819,BillM,2013-01-30 19:23:00,17367,"lol...kinda like you were doing to me last year for a short time?   Huh?  Sorry man, I've got better things to do with my time then follow someone around on a fishing forum..   As for why?  I just don't see myself using or purchasing a handgun..    I'm happy with my rifles and shotguns."
763820,ch312,2013-01-30 19:23:00,1590," good thing too, i'd hate to be sharing the bush with someone like that! some people just don't understand how easily accidents can happen and you need to be on your ""A game"" when handling firearms."
763822,ch312,2013-01-30 19:31:00,1590," fair enough. i just like to learn and understand the different views other firearms owners have, as well as those who are against firearms all together. and yes, i did ask ""why"" a lot when i was a kid and still do...  PS...there are many rifles and shotguns classified as restricted. there's a big misconception out there that restricted = only handguns."
762982,tb4me,2013-01-27 19:55:00,3295,Have some good news I wanted to share with you all... Finally went and finished the Canadian Firearms Safety course 2 weeks ago and just finished up my hunter Ed course today. I'm done and Legit now.. After 4 days of in class over 2 weekends I am good to go now..Just waiting on my Papers to come in the mail to get it all finalized..Now to find some land to hunt on..Any offers? lol
762984,Leecher,2013-01-27 20:19:00,7832,"Awesome Ron    Congrats and welcome to the club  Hunting is a lot of fun, as long as it's practiced in safety  Again, congratulations mon ami!!! TJunkie"
762986,TJQ,2013-01-27 20:26:00,7806,Good for you!!
762987,rmarentette,2013-01-27 20:41:00,124,Congratulations! I haven't hunted in years and I miss it. Good for you!
762988,bigbuck,2013-01-27 20:42:00,2449,Good for you. I'm hoping to do mine later this spring and get out deer hunting this fall.
763005,porkpie,2013-01-27 22:36:00,2521,Good luck man!  Prepare to open your wallet!!
763015,tb4me,2013-01-27 23:08:00,3295,Ya thats what im afraid of.. Thanks to all for the best wishes.. I had to share
763020,Sinker,2013-01-27 23:48:00,8692,"Right on! Congrats!  You may as well forget about fishing from sept till Jan now, and yeah, blow the dust off the wallet!  What do you want to hunting first?  S."
763029,tb4me,2013-01-28 00:37:00,3295,"I have been invited by a friend to go deal with some cyotes on his farm. He has well over 30 guns.. Going to go have at a few of them to see wich ones I like best. I suppose thats a good start. Im most looking forward to deer season next year.. I have already been invited to join a group. I was supposed to be ready for this years hunt and I got lazy and didnt do it. Missed out on a great hunt this year. The group filled out all thier tags. Including 2 , 8 point bucks..Lets hope next year is just as good.."
763033,NAW,2013-01-28 00:52:00,4022,"Good on ya man!  The PAL papers can take a while to get in the mail.  Mine took a few months.  Are you going to stick to the guns, or get in to bow hunting at all?  Hunting can be a lifestyle for some people.  More then just a week long deer hunt once a year.  Enjoy it!"
763102,BillM,2013-01-28 12:40:00,17367,PAL will definitely take some time...  Took probably a month and a half to get mine after it was submitted.  Congrats!
763104,bushart,2013-01-28 13:06:00,2628,Congrats and my PAL renewal also took 2 mos  my advice on the hunting/shooting  Practice...practice...practice-----moving targets as well once you get your gun dialed in  & Always try to make that 1st shot count  Good luck---it's a great time being in the woods
763132,jedimaster,2013-01-28 14:54:00,3472,"Yep, it'll take about 2 months, plenty of time for you to list some fishing stuff for sale and start putting money away for the new shotgun, rifle and muzzle loader."
763188,farsider,2013-01-28 17:24:00,456,"Go to the Canadian Gun Nutz forum.  They have an excellent pinned thread on how to speed up your Pal approval process.  The biggest thing is to go online to the CFC site after you have submitted your application and monitor the progress.  Call in for your interview and have your references call in for their interviews as well.  I did my non and restricted and hunting this past year.   They are mandated to hold your application for a min. of 28days.  I followed the advice from CGN and it was sent right out after the 28 days even with restricted.  The hard part is finding land to hunt on.  I am looking forward to my first turkey hunt this spring.  Cheers,  Mark"
763195,tb4me,2013-01-28 17:34:00,3295,Thanks for the info Mark. I had no idea there were interviews involved here. Im not worried as all my references are good and I have never been divorced. That got me thinking here. Am I allowed to fre any non restricted gun without the PAL process completed? My friend says he is sure im allowed as long as he is there with me. I know I can bow hunt any time I want now that I completed the hunter Ed course. The last thing I want to do is get caught with a gun in my havd before the process is completed (card in hand) and ruin it all fo rme.
763197,BillM,2013-01-28 17:37:00,17367,If he's got a PAL you can fire his gun if he's there with you.
763205,musky_hunter,2013-01-28 18:20:00,328,congrats..i;ve had my license for 10 years now and love blasting.
763207,Steel28,2013-01-28 18:27:00,160,^^ Bill is correct. Enjoy the sport.
763222,ch312,2013-01-28 19:25:00,1590,"congrats! i'm always glad to see another person join ""us""."
763275,BruceCfisher86,2013-01-28 22:36:00,49,"Don't be afraid to check out County Forest Tracts, I started hunting 7 years ago and Have had more success on public land then anywhere! They are my go to spots for me to take my daughter for an outing because there is usually a descent consentration of animals(during bow season that is), unfortunatly when the pushers come for gun week...This usually  all comes to an end!  Good luck!"
763352,hotsky,2013-01-29 03:17:00,400,"Congrats, hope you got your restricted too. I did mine 8 years ago."
763386,BillM,2013-01-29 13:00:00,17367," I didn't bother with my restricted, really didn't see the point."
763496,ch312,2013-01-29 18:59:00,1590, and?
763498,BillM,2013-01-29 19:04:00,17367, Are you following me around like a lost puppy?    Go ride someone else's nuts.
763499,Spiel,2013-01-29 19:07:00,9065," I've noticed it since I came up from the shop 20 minutes ago and if it doesn't stop, well......"
