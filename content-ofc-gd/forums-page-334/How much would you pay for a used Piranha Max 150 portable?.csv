763471,hotsky,2013-01-29 17:48:00,400,I have a chance to pick up few years old Hummingbird PirhanaMax 150 Portable fishfinder. Guy says he never used it. Weather it's true or not assuming it works ok how much would you pay if you can get one new for $130+tax?
763475,BillM,2013-01-29 18:03:00,17367,$80.

763483,Rich,2013-01-29 18:29:00,3927,"Yeah definitely, more expensive gear always brings success"
763487,Rich,2013-01-29 18:33:00,3927,Imagine how much more money I'd have if I had a heroin addiction to quit!

763505,moxie,2013-01-29 19:16:00,1566,hehehe. No but it often amazes me how a little patience can often provide other opportunities and better options.
763576,Burtess,2013-01-29 23:08:00,901,"I price matched the 160 portable at CT (with LeBaron price) for $119 + tax.  I bought it with the thought that since the portable pack with battery is around $140 by itself so if the actual unit didn't work well I would just sell it cheap, keep the portable pack, and upgrade to a better sonar.  I tried it out this past weekend.  Works great and can clearly see a 1/64oz tear drop with 2 maggots on it in 20ft of water.  It even marks a half dozen maggots slowly sinking to the bottom after chumming the hole!  How much better are the more expensive units?  Burt"
763580,asdve23rveavwa,2013-01-29 23:19:00,2690,"$80 tops, considering Juli picked one up at Walmart three years ago for $99."
