761894,Freshtrax,2013-01-23 21:07:00,2215,"Battery for my fish finder, just picked one up in kw area for 24.99 good price for 12 v   7.5 Ah ?  Is it enough to run finder?  I have no clue but I'm tired of lugging my garden tractor battery around all winter lol."
761902,Terry,2013-01-23 21:15:00,14456,that is the size most people use and will run most fishfinders for a weekend but hds 5 and above will not last a day with background light on full
761905,fishnsled,2013-01-23 21:19:00,3520,"Price is not bad, my Dad use to run his finder on one of those all day with no problems.  Most are running a larger battery (12V / 9amps) I would believe.  All depends on which unit you have and the draw it needs to run.  My Dad's was an older Humminbird with a monochromatic screen.  Edit -  Terry said     I thought it was the higher amps one.  lol!  Pretty sure that is what I have (9amps)"
761909,East Luther,2013-01-23 21:31:00,9,"Not bad, but there is an electronic store in Mississauga, on Matheson Blvd. just South of 401 West of Dixie, actually there is 3 electronic shops, but the one I can't remember it's name but it is beside the place below. Same battery for 15.99!! AA Electronics1350 Matheson Blvd E., Unit 8Mississauga, Ontario L4W 4M1Canada  Cheers,  EL"
761910,Freshtrax,2013-01-23 21:32:00,2215,I'm not using anything fancy.  Hummingbird something or other.  Works for me I can see the lure and the fish in 100fow.  Thanks guys.
761913,Terry,2013-01-23 21:37:00,14456,"yeah that will work well, it's the same amps as the one that came with my x67c ice"
761920,BillM,2013-01-23 21:52:00,17367,Perfect battery for you finder!  Goodluck bud!
761925,adempsey,2013-01-23 22:04:00,1498,That's 7.5 Amp Hours not 7 Amps.   It indicates how much energy your battery can store and deliver over a period of time.  I bought a 9 Amp hour battery for my sonar so it operates for a longer period of time.   All my finders have come with the 7.5Ah batteries.  Vexilar flashers (and maybe others) I believe come with 9Ah batteries.
761927,nancur373,2013-01-23 22:15:00,1211,I second that
761942,Nipfisher,2013-01-23 23:05:00,2449,Only 4-5 hours on full charge with my HDS5 IF I have the GPS on and back light. With satalite tracking off I get 8-9 hours.
761943,Terry,2013-01-23 23:10:00,14456,I never thought to turn off satellite tracking..... I have a gps on my ski doo so I really don't need it on the hds..good tip
761945,misfish,2013-01-23 23:20:00,29133," If you do that,how will I find you? LOL  I get a full day out of my battery. No back light on,(unless I,m in the flip hut,with the window flaps closed). ."
761948,Terry,2013-01-23 23:27:00,14456,outside you can;t see a hds without back light in a hut you can turn the back light way down
761951,nancur373,2013-01-23 23:32:00,1211,Just take your trolling motor battery and you won't run out of juice
762881,Terry,2013-01-27 02:20:00,14456,"ok, how do you shut off satellite tracking on hds5"
