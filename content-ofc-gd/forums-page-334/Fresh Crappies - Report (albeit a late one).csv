We rarely keep any during a season, but when we got into consistent eaters we decided it was time for our annual fish fry. We caught close to 50 eating size crappies and brought home 9. Salted minnows on micro heads were the ticket for me and Eric, Rob was nailing just as many on a Whatsit jig. Great times, and a great meal. These were chipotle/mango/garlic breaded.. amazing. What's your favourite breading or batter?     (Yes that is a gluten free beer lol)  "

763718,Christopheraaron,2013-01-30 14:02:00,3525,Very nice catch!
