763429,ckrb2007,2013-01-29 15:53:00,449,"Well I'm sure all of you know it was complete mayhem out there this weekend so I figured I'd put in my 2 cents worth. I went out the entire weekend, met some board members out there and fished with my ""normal"" fishin' buddy, Todd. Had a blast as always hooking into lots-o-lakers. Todd managed one whitey for table fare and I went 0-4 on the buggers. I know all of you like looking at the fish porn so here ya go. It's pic heavy and in no particular order. I also threw in a little video. It's my first attempt with Sony Vegas or any other editing software so be gentle!       Cheers,Colin"

763607,Locnar,2013-01-30 00:34:00,645,Beauties! That is an awesome day of fishing. I've never be able to go out for lakers on Simcoe... as I'm always heel-toeing my gear around. What kind of fishfinder are you using? Is it a humminbird?
763639,adempsey,2013-01-30 01:56:00,1498,Beauty Lakers!   Thanks for posting.   Think I'll wait for 2 more inches though =)
