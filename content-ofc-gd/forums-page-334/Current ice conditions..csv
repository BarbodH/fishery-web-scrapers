762704,dhickey,2013-01-26 05:01:00,1038,I have 3 days off for the first time since Labour Day. Next weekend (Feb 1 2 3} Origionaly I was planing on Simcoe but with the warm wheather and rain possibly coming Im scrambling for a contingency plan?  I know the lakes out there in the summer but havent fished the hard water in 10yrs. Any info on ice and snow conditions would be very mutch appreciated.  Saltydawg/Don  
762782,RickOnt,2013-01-26 18:00:00,669,"SD  9"" of ice at Gilford yesterday. Light snow cover.  If we get some rain it will take the snow away. But a little rain won't kill 9"" of Ice!!  Rick"
762789,dhickey,2013-01-26 19:18:00,1038,Thanks Rick. Im not a big fan of Gillford I usally start out of lefroy and according to todays reports its only 4 inches. Warm day time temps and rain along with night time temps just below freezing doesnt look good for Whiteys or lakers next weekend? Although I am  hoping for the best. Failing that I think Im gona go take a poke at pike amd maby pics in Hastings.  I wish I put a ? mark in the title..  Thanks Saltydawg.
