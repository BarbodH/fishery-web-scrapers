763594,Ron,2013-01-30 00:05:00,1683,"Small world Aaron.  We were set up closer to shore than you guys. Had I've known it was you and Tony, I would have popped out to say ""Hi"". Some of those pressure cracks opened up and shifting when we got off the ice. The scariest moment was when my buddy was ahead of me by about 60 ft. The ice cracked and shifted about 14 inches. I should have taken a picture of it as you could see the shift by his sled tracks and foot prints. we got a late start but did put a hurten on lakers and a few whities.  When did you start doning the beard and stache?  Cheers, Ron...."
