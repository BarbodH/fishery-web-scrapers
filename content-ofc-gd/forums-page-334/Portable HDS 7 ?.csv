763229,Terry,2013-01-28 20:05:00,14456,mine has internal antenna I found in navigation I can tell it to get gps info from different unit..but it doesn't say if that turns it off. I saw no change in voltage...will keep looking
763241,SlowPoke,2013-01-28 20:43:00,2984,"I'm finding the same result. Menu/Settings/System/Satellites... Even when you remove the source, the iGPS is still searching for satellites. I tried entering demo mode which will turn off GPS but it also puts sonar into demo mode. I'm shocked they would drop that capability from the LMS units, I hope we're just missing something."
763253,Sinker,2013-01-28 21:16:00,8692,"I use an old lowrance X-96. The thing works mint thru the ice. I use the skimmer transducer, and it marks any jig you want down to 100ft easily in real time.  I really don't see the need for a fancy, colour, gps combo on the ice. Your really just beating up your nicer units for nothing. The cheap lowrance I use marks the exact same fish as the nicer colour units, and mine will run for days on a single battery.  Just sayin....  S."
763266,SlowPoke,2013-01-28 21:57:00,2984,"The colour unit is nice in flasher mode but the real reason most of us use ""fancy"" machines is because we already have them."
763316,Sinker,2013-01-29 01:03:00,8692,"I have fancy ones too, but I'd rather beat up a $200 unit that does the EXACT same thing. Do people really use the flasher mode on their graphs? I. Use a graph, because I prefer a graph lol......  To each their own I guess.  S."
763337,Moosebunk,2013-01-29 02:22:00,3970," I do Shane.  The X67 gives either option and since moving down here and beginning to use a sonar for ice fishing, that's just simply what I chose to start out with.  Now again though I'll flip to the graph for the heck of it.  People just get used to relating to familiarity right.  No right or wrong way... but I do kind of agree, you don't need to get ""fancy,"" unless you want to."
763391,Lunker777,2013-01-29 13:24:00,866,"      The only reason is because I already have the HDS units. I have two of them I bought for the boat last year. I bought them used, so I don't have a whole lot of money invested. I only used one for the MAJORITY of the season.... so I figured I could use the other as a unit for on the ice..... the 3-4 times a year I get out.  I have invested enough in ice fishing this year so far :/.... I don't want to go out and spend another $2-300 on another F/F. lol Especially with this warm spell that just rolled through..... I don't think we are going to see ice in southern Ontario the rest of this season."
762439,Lunker777,2013-01-25 14:41:00,866,Hey everyone  I was just wondering if it is possible to make my HDS7 portable for ice ? What would it require ? Thanks ?  
762456,BillM,2013-01-25 15:38:00,17367,Does Lowrance make a portable pack for it?
762462,Roy,2013-01-25 16:17:00,13728,It would probably cost you almost as much to modify it as it would to buy a small reliable ice unit...plus you wouldn't be banging the HDS7 around all winter. IMHO
762468,Terry,2013-01-25 16:51:00,14456,lots of people do it  it can be done cheap......buy a 5 buck tool box at walmart and a 7.5 amp hour battery you attach your transducer to a stick  and it is portable or you can buy their portable kit that gives you power cable battery ice ducer  and a soft pack to put it all in
762667,Nipfisher,2013-01-26 02:44:00,2449,"Yes, you can. I bought the PP-1 Portable Power Pack from Radioworld for my HDS5. Came with a case, battery, ice transducer, and gimble bracket."
762857,vinnimon,2013-01-27 00:35:00,2593,"Heres what I did, three 7 amp batteries and extra storage space . "
762860,vinnimon,2013-01-27 00:38:00,2593,another pic 
762863,BillM,2013-01-27 01:16:00,17367,That thing must last a week on 3 batteries!  Nice setup.
762874,irishfield,2013-01-27 01:48:00,26272,"I bet it's plugged in each night Bill. My 102C eats two batteries by 3pm in the afternoon... starting at about 8am. If I stay inside with it on the lowest intensity it gets me thru the day 'till dusk. Terry's HDS-5 is dead by days end on two as well.  I've actually started plugging my ""box"" in during the move on the sled with a Y adapter into my heated helmet cable to give it some charge on the run between spots."
762875,BillM,2013-01-27 01:54:00,17367,"Wow, I didn't think they ate through batteries that fast..  My 747C is good for about a day and a half if I'm out for a full day."
762998,vinnimon,2013-01-27 21:58:00,2593,"Only charged once on three trips last year. Another bonus is that the monitor fits into the waterproof  box. Spending that kind of $s on a ff, i wasnt going to cheap out on a box."
763094,wormdunker,2013-01-28 10:47:00,1711,"Good idea for mounting your gear.  I have an ice 55, fish all day with 1 battery & lots of power left at the end of the day."
763109,Lunker777,2013-01-28 13:52:00,866,Hmmm plenty of great ideas guys !!!!  I guess I have some work to do !!
763111,Lunker777,2013-01-28 13:56:00,866,What is the price of the kit ?? I can't access the site @ work
763115,Nipfisher,2013-01-28 14:08:00,2449,Here is my HDS5 PP-1 set up. I use the battery from my aqua-vu as a back up and between the 2 batteries I get a full day use.     
763117,Nipfisher,2013-01-28 14:09:00,2449,I think it was around $130. It comes with a transducer bracket that holds the cable over the hole but I didn't like it so I made the float using pipe-foam.
763135,jedimaster,2013-01-28 14:58:00,3472,"I picked up a 5x DSI and at first I wasn't happy with it on the ice, but after this weekend it was awesome. I had the transducer pointed the wrong direction. haha. I haven't had a chance to actually do the battery setup I was lookging to do so in the mean time I have been using the 8 D battery rig it came with and the 8 D's lasted all day yesterday from 8am until 6pm. They still have juice so I am not too sure how long they will last in the end but it certainly got the job done, and was fairly fast reacting."
763163,Lunker777,2013-01-28 15:50:00,866,"Do you have to use that style of tranducer ? Or can I use the spare I have, meant for the boat ?"
763166,Nipfisher,2013-01-28 15:54:00,2449, That one comes with the kit. You could use a square one but you would have to ensure it is pointing straight down. Wayne suggested ataching it to a piece of wood with a cross piece on the ice so it doesn't fall in.
763184,SlowPoke,2013-01-28 16:59:00,2984,"The skimmer transducer will work but you'll appreciate the iceducer for the short flexy cord and always pointing straight down. If you opt for the skimmer transducer; mount it on a 1""x2"" board about 6"" longer than the depth of any ice you might fish. (ie. 14"" of ice = 20"" stick) Drill 1/4"" holes through the face of the board 1"" from the top and spaced 3"" apart... the last hole being about 6"" away from the transducer mount. Hold the stick in the hole lightly allowing it to find its own buoyancy and insert a 1/4"" rod through next lower drilled hole. Make sure the rod is long enough to span your opening in the ice with some overlap. This will allow the transducer to dangle instead of float and will always be oriented correctly."
763189,DRIFTER_016,2013-01-28 17:26:00,10439,  My LMS-350 Lowrance with GPS would get 12-14 hours per charge on a motorcycle/snowmobile battery. A group 24 deep cycle would give me a week and change.
763194,SlowPoke,2013-01-28 17:31:00,2984,"The backlight and GPS suck up a lot of juice. To extend your day, lower the backlight and turn off your GPS when not required. You can almost double your battery life in mild temperatures."
763199,Terry,2013-01-28 17:40:00,14456,how do you turn off the gps???????????????????????????????????????????????????????? on a hds unit
763223,SlowPoke,2013-01-28 19:32:00,2984,I'll look into that right now. I haven't used my HDS on ice yet but noticed a big difference in battery life on my LMS units.
763226,Roy,2013-01-28 19:49:00,13728,I have an external antenna and the GPS won't even power up without it plugged into the unit.
