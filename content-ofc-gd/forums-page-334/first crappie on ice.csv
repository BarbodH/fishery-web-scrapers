763037,Jer,2013-01-28 01:24:00,1426,Very nice...where were you at? We were on Chemong today but only managed couple dink perch and a little rocky.
763039,TJQ,2013-01-28 01:27:00,7806,Nice... big stuff!
763044,Acountdeleted,2013-01-28 01:42:00,2562,Nice. Great catch.
763047,jedimaster,2013-01-28 01:48:00,3472,Thanks it wasn't my spot or my lake so I am sworn to secrecy.
763069,pics,2013-01-28 02:58:00,1268,Thats the thing about good crappie spots.....no one will ever tell you and if you find a spot on your own you have to keep it a secret!!......nice fish!!
763078,jedimaster,2013-01-28 03:41:00,3472,Its part of the code. You want to find it you gotta get out there. If I find a spot I'll take people there blindfolded with a cavity search for gps's. Haha  I was trying to get a few pics of them to show the size...  The sink shot...    And the traditional full size dinner plate shot... 
763082,moxie,2013-01-28 04:11:00,1566,Nicely done. We were at our Crappie spot today and we were rewarded for the third time in 3 trips. Can you say Honey Hole???
763092,wormdunker,2013-01-28 10:25:00,1711,Those are the nicest crappie I've ever seen.  Good job!
763196,dheitzner,2013-01-28 17:36:00,314,Those are some slabs Vince; not much is tastier than a good ol' crappie kill! Darc
763219,jedimaster,2013-01-28 19:09:00,3472,"Oh yah, I hear you on that one. I love crappie. One of the best eating fish around. These are PB's for me by about 2 inches. I haven't seen any bigger caught in person before. I have seen pictures of some hogs and heard stories of 16 inchers... I'll be on the prowl for bigger this season. 16 inch's and I might get it mounted."
763323,NAW,2013-01-29 01:23:00,4022,Nice slabs man!!  My crappie season is over.   But seeing those big boys.... Make me want to head back out!
