762551,BruceCfisher86,2013-01-25 20:26:00,49,How was the  fishing there in 2012?
762563,BillM,2013-01-25 21:20:00,17367,You're going to be hard pressed for people to give out info on small lakes like that.
762600,BruceCfisher86,2013-01-25 23:47:00,49,"Well what other kind of questions do ask on these forums ""Fishing God""?"

762673,BillM,2013-01-26 02:57:00,17367," Not those ones when you've got 9 posts and are here for one reason only.  Good luck, go for a drive, fish it and tell us how you made out."
762697,NAW,2013-01-26 04:37:00,4022,What else do you post?  How about a little intro.  Help answer others questions.  Give a little support to some friends.  Ask totally none fishing related questions.  Talk about hockey.  Stopping smoking.  Losing weight.  Having babies.  Lots of other things to post about.  I didn't fish Cameron in 2012..  So I can't answer your question.
762716,hawk-eye,2013-01-26 07:46:00,141,Going to have a hard time making friends here with comments like that.  Stay safe.
762739,BruceCfisher86,2013-01-26 14:23:00,49,Which comments are those? Anyways you stay safe too.!
763099,Rich,2013-01-28 11:16:00,3927,"Fishing is great, take your truck out the ice is 4 feet. What really worked for me there is drilling a complete circle of holes around me and chisling out the useless pieces in between. Then jumping up and down as the vibrations are great attractant.  Good luck out there!"
763107,Acountdeleted,2013-01-28 13:23:00,2562,I didn't even know there were fish in that lake. Whenever I stay at Cyprus for camping I always leave the fishing gear at home. Didn't know that anything lived in either of those lakes.
