763468,Rich,2013-01-29 17:43:00,3927,Your auger with new blades will drill faster and easier than it would with the drill adaptor.. and far more holes. That thing is built for effortless speed drilling..
763469,GBW,2013-01-29 17:44:00,8460,if you were close to me I would say come by and take the one I had made...
