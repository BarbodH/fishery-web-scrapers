So I am looking for a little project at home that I can do with some scrap peices of woods around the house.  Im asking those of you who have built your own tip downs/ups ( different names depending where your located I have found lol ) to show your builds !  I have a few guys asking to come out on the ice ... they want to bring there kids and I figure this would be the most effective way to keep the kids busy... chasin down tip ups all day !  Thanks in advance
