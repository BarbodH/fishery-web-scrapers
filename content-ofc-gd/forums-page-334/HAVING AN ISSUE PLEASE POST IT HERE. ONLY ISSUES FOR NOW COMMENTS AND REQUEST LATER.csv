760568,Dutch,2013-01-19 03:48:00,831,"Layout issue - at the top of my screen there is something called the ""Member Menu""  it is located at the top left of the screen.  Problem is it is only 2 inches wide by 3 inches tall but takes up the entire 2 inches of the lefthand side of the screen all the way down the left.  Also, the area that has our avatar and the word ""member"" under it takes up 3 inches.    All of the replies to threads don't use either part of the screen at all so the use of screen real estate is very bad.  I'm looking at this now and literally my reply is only on half of the screen because the amount of room taken up by that menu and the part reserved for the avatar.  The Mobile site needs a lot of work before it is even useable.  I'm sure things will come around in due course."

758151,Rich Nelson,2013-01-10 21:20:00,332,"Im having an issue. Too many post are being locked by certain Mods without a justifiable reason. 1. Just because you dont agree with opinions is no reason to lock it. 2. Just because someone mentions locking a thread , or ""see how long this lasts""is not justification for doing it. 3. You cant see into the future, so locking a topic based on the title, or where you think it might be headed is no reason to lock it. Im well aware of rules, and Far too often lately I have seen topics locked when no rules were broken. Lets let people on here speak thier minds, (within the rules) and not continue to let it be the ""old boys club""  And a suggestion that I think most would agree with... How about making the ""fishing forum"" and nf forum completly separate. Whether its posted in the title or not, I dont really care to hear about what kind of car you drive, how long ago you quit smoking, or when your dog died."
