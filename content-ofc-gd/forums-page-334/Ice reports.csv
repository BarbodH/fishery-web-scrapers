761258,slightlyhuman,2013-01-21 18:43:00,29,"yea with that wind this weekend there's no way i'd be caught out there in a boat, saw some stuff from cooks bay tho. this isn't me, just found on facebook.  "

761342,dhickey,2013-01-21 22:50:00,1038,Any bets on going past Fox On Friday??  Simcoe for those that dont fish whitey or laker..
761354,Freshtrax,2013-01-21 23:09:00,2215,Don't think I'll be out past fox but I bet the parts of kemp. Will be a complete zoo like last year.  Time will tell I would love to get out around BBP .   There's gotta be some fat whites in there without the cull from last winter. I bet there craving Williams spoons as well since  they haven't seen one in years.
761358,Christopheraaron,2013-01-21 23:18:00,3525,Any reports on rice? Thinking of heading out around gores landing tomorrow.
761365,misfish,2013-01-21 23:45:00,29133,"Just back from walking the pooch. It,s dropping fast out there. AWESOME."
761366,BillM,2013-01-21 23:48:00,17367," Everyone thought the spring would be a slam because of the lack of pressure due to bad ice last year and it wasn't, who knows what those stupid things are up to, lol...  We need the winds to stay calm for a few days, even with this cold weather, no ice is going to form with 30km/h winds..    I'm guessing maybe 1st week of Feb if the winds die down."
761418,Joeytier,2013-01-22 01:17:00,3990,Lots of vehicles on the ice and we won't be seeing temps warmer than -20 before the weekend.  Hoping for a warm spell lol!

761539,Acountdeleted,2013-01-22 16:52:00,2562,Island lake opened up today. Lots of huts on the ice. Girl at the gate said they had 5-6 inches on the main lake but back in the islands wasn't quite safe yet.
761651,hotsky,2013-01-22 23:23:00,400,Any updates on Binbrook? it should be well below zero till monday 28th. Would love to get out on the weekend.

761732,whiskywizard,2013-01-23 02:43:00,305,"I ran a lap of Sturgeon Lake today on the sled. Worst ice I drilled was 4"" of black ice with 3"" of corn.  Some places were >6"" of good clear black ice. There's no open water in the channel at the South end. Last year, the channel never froze over for more than a night or 2."
761753,Freshtrax,2013-01-23 04:40:00,2215, I'm pretty sure I can convince a few to come to the surface and I'm fairly confident ill be getting out to an outa the way honey hole on sat.
761775,misfish,2013-01-23 11:40:00,29133," -30 this morning. You can bet is thickening up good and fast. Saturday is looking like big fish day.  Have you looked at next weeks forcast,hate to say,but here comes another warm front.Then again,it may just be a scare tatic.LOL"
761782,Rich,2013-01-23 12:23:00,3927,I would also like to know if Binbrook is good yet.. havent been there in years.
761788,whiskywizard,2013-01-23 13:03:00,305, The T-S guys have definitely been diddling water levels more this winter than last.  Not sure why.  They're going to wear out the stop logs in Lindsay.
761801,ecmilley,2013-01-23 13:33:00,2163,they had logs out again tuesday with both sluices running full bore down the river

762728,Marko,2013-01-26 13:31:00,854,"Got out one day before the cold moved in. Ice was forming all around me...scared the s**t out of me few times. Its really not that pleasant standing on a frozen river as you hear the ice crack right underneath your legs. Managed to get some Perch, even bothered taking a pic of one.   Also got a baby pike, thought i had nice walleye one for a minute until that snout popped out through the hole.....almost disappointing lol.   Down the hole it goes to live another day and get even bigger.   Tight lines Marko"
762840,DRIFTER_016,2013-01-26 23:31:00,10439,"Drilled through 44"" of clear black ice on Great Slave today. Only drilled 3 holes before I was whipped. Been fighting a bad infection for 2 months now and my staying power seems to be down a few notches. Barely had enough energy to jig after I was set up."

756825,Christopheraaron,2013-01-06 16:44:00,3525,Here's our catch yesterday:  
756826,Acountdeleted,2013-01-06 16:49:00,2562,Does anyone know if Island Lake in Orangeville is locked up?
756832,Christopheraaron,2013-01-06 17:04:00,3525,"I would think so, considering there's so much safe ice here in RH I would think a more rural, farther north place like orangeville would be fine, at least in most of the bays. Thinking of going tomorrow?"
756843,Christopheraaron,2013-01-06 17:19:00,3525," Just guessing here, 2 days ago the lake I was on was covered in snow, yesterday it was all gone, and it didn't just melt, I'm thinking maybe it blew away"
756866,Acountdeleted,2013-01-06 18:01:00,2562,"  Ha ha I wasn't planning on it but I think I could duck out for a few hours. Want to meet up and see if its safe to try and bring in some pike?  Edit: Whoops, nevermind. The lake is unsafe and the conservation area is closed. Ah well. Maybe in a week or two."
756875,Christopheraaron,2013-01-06 18:24:00,3525," I might be free a couple hours, we could try the lakes around my place?"
757213,adempsey,2013-01-07 18:36:00,1498," Thanks for the info.  We went up for the weekend and there was 8"" of ice where we were."
757231,Marko,2013-01-07 20:00:00,854,I was out on Rideau River-Nicolls Island Saturday. 4 inches of slush with about 6-8 inches of good ice at least. Got bunch this size.   White jig tipped with a minnow was the ticket .  Stay safe out there
757327,jbailey,2013-01-07 23:54:00,866,"was out on jacks lake the last couple days, the ice was about 6-7', plenty of people out and about"

759500,slightlyhuman,2013-01-15 18:54:00,29,*BUMP*  that warm weather was deadly! i still haven't even gone to get my outdoors card. anyone up north have any new reports now that its starting to get cold again?

760088,Christopheraaron,2013-01-17 18:28:00,3525,I'll let you know after tomorrow
760121,Acountdeleted,2013-01-17 19:57:00,2562,You'll have to let me know how it goes Chris. Bed ridden today (stupid cold) work tomorow and Saturday and Lazer quest with buddies Sunday. I'll be hitting that lake on Monday.
760139,Christopheraaron,2013-01-17 20:53:00,3525,"That doesn't sound like much fun. Well by next week the little pond will be more then ready, could try that. I also have my eye on another nice pond (looks a little better then the first one we went to) that we could try. Let me know when you're feeling better and we'll try to get out. Until then have some fish broth and get to bed"
760147,Acountdeleted,2013-01-17 21:14:00,2562,Haha thanks. I've these cold tempratures keep up I've got a list of lakes the length of my arm I can't wait to try out.
760269,Garfisher,2013-01-18 03:45:00,229,"My two friends and I skated a hut down Sturgeon today. Thinnest we found was 6-7"" (where we set it), a lot of ice around 8"". We didn't venture out toward the middle, but within 100-150m of shore should be perfectly fine along the eastern side (around pleasant point). Note: a word of advise, skating a hut 2.5-3km and then skating back is a real good work out"
760273,irishfield,2013-01-18 03:53:00,26272,My neighbour at the lake just drove his explorer to the dock... so I think we're gonna be good up there considering a full week of -25C to come starting Monday!
760349,slightlyhuman,2013-01-18 15:17:00,29,any word on how the muskokas are doing? im itching to get out on rosseau and have a chance next weekend! lets hope this week is good to us
760351,mr blizzard,2013-01-18 15:27:00,1589,"With -40s past few weeks (months) lol we are pushing30 to 36 inches, enough to groom the ice roads, hope u get some good ice down there real soon, I can see it happening according to the weather network."

761226,ckrb2007,2013-01-21 17:03:00,449,"Lots of ""loonies"" fishing through 7"" of ice over at VB and PB on Saturday."
761232,BillM,2013-01-21 17:39:00,17367," I'm guessing he thinks they were out on the laker/whitie grounds...  Which would have been ok, because they'd be in a boat, lol!"
755860,slightlyhuman,2013-01-02 21:22:00,29,"couldn't find one so I thought it might be a good idea to have a central thread everyone can go to find ice reports for places they might be looking to fish.    I haven't heard much, I know the kawarthas have been getting populated with huts lately, haven't heard anything about Simcoe where I am now. I've heard the Huntsville area is pretty thick, up to 6-7 inches in spots. Friend in Haliburton dropped his hut thru the ice today, so that doesn't sound promising there.  personally I'm looking to find out about Lake Rosseau right now if anyone has information, I have some friends on small lakes that say they're ok, but no reports on the bigger lakes.    IF YOU HAVE ANY INFO ON THE CONDITION OF YOUR LAKE, POST HERE!  Happy new year and happy fishing everyone!"
755865,misfish,2013-01-02 21:28:00,29133,"Welcome to Barrie. Been finding small lakes with 2.5-4 inches of ice. Havent hit anything past Huntsville yet. Waiting to hear about a lake near my pops, for pike and pickeral.  Safe fishing to you."
755873,Acountdeleted,2013-01-02 21:57:00,2562,Small Lakes in Huntsville are totally locked up I'd say 5-6 inches of ice. I haven't tried Lake Vernon nor do I know the area well enough to do so. The only lake in my area is Island Lake and I'm not even going to bother making the drive for another week or so.
755892,DRIFTER_016,2013-01-02 22:36:00,10439,Crap loads of ice way up in the North country.

756199,GBW,2013-01-04 02:03:00,8460,a rope is never a bad idea.  4 mile lkae just skimed over between Christmas and New Years as there was a 1' high waves just before that so BE SAFE!
756202,Christopheraaron,2013-01-04 02:20:00,3525," Taking it at a snails pace, I'll let you guys know how I do"
756361,whiskywizard,2013-01-04 19:48:00,305,"I augered a dozen test holes in Sturgeon Lake today.  All were in one general area, extreme south end of the lake, east side.  I started right near shore and stopped about 700M out.  Ice thickness ranged from a low of 4-5"" to a high of 6-7"".  The ice sheet is sitting fully on the water surface, no air gaps in my 12 holes.  None of it was really good ice all the way through, so I stopped about 200M from the main bouyed channel.  I'd feel fine ice fishing on foot, no more than 2 guys together.  I would not park a sled or quad for an extended period and I would not park 2 together at all.  I wouldn't go anywhere there was measurable flow."
756363,Christopheraaron,2013-01-04 19:57:00,3525,"Skunked today, ice was 4-5"" around the shore, out in the middle you could see that it was thin, still nice to get out."

756699,manitoubass2,2013-01-06 01:55:00,11391,"Lotsa ice on my end of Rainy River. About 14"" in the non current areas, 8-10 inches in lighter current areas, back eddies are full of smash ice. Still need to be careful on where your going. Water levels are the lowest I've ever seen in the winter months, and I thought that would mean quicker/thicker ice, but not really the case. Still lotsa open water.  Tons of smaller lakes in Sunset Country ready to go, just look at Limeys reports"
756702,captpierre,2013-01-06 02:09:00,2521,Gannon Narrows wide open near the bridge and to the east.  North end of Pigeon greeny/gey ice -nobody on it

756772,Jer,2013-01-06 14:45:00,1426,"We were surprised to find 8"" of clear, black ice on Upper Buckhorn a couple hundred yards off my shoreline yesterday. Of course the fish were nowhere to be found for the few hours we tried, but that seems to be the norm for our first outing of the season.  The ice on this lake is historically very inconsistent, with very limited safe ice at the best of times. Where we were on the lake has been ice-covered for the better part of a month now, other parts of the lake only froze over recently, if at all.  Chemong had a few anglers just south of the causeway yesterday, and more have been fishing around Fife's Bay for a week or more. The ice around the causeway didn't seem to freeze very evenly this year, with large open areas still visible as late as Christmas.  As always, be safe!"
