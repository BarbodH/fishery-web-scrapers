763250,Sinker,2013-01-28 21:11:00,8692,Nope. Just got back from there. Bring some gear and hit the saltwater. Lots of fish to be caught! You can catch all the bass you want here!!  S.

They said they lost most of their bass when it flooded with salt water during a storm. However, they have some further inland that are supposed to be great."

After a day or 2 of catching the saltwater equivalent of panfish I tried my hand at some bigger fish. My resort had a large weed bed ~60yards out and to the right of the beach so I used a storm crankbait that I brought...boy was I surprised.  Hooked into a barracuda, and it straightened out my cheap trebble. Next day saw a guy catching small baitfish with a hook and bread and was using them as live bait for the 'cudas. I tried it just to see, lets just say barracuda are easy to hook, but hard to land (especially in waste high water with a POS rod/reel and 8lb test).  Moral of the story, bring better gear next time and slay the 'cudas. I hooked into 3 in the trip and it becomes a spectacle for the beach goers....lets just say loosing the fish/line being cut not only disappoints you, but also the onlookers haha.  Never tried for bass though, that would have been fun and probably a bit easier to land on my crappy gear. Have fun and enjoy saltwater fishing, I know I did with what little time I put into it"

They call bass trucha (green trout) in Cuba, I have family in Cuba and I remember seeing good size fish in ponds and rivers near their house. Research Hotel Hanabanilla, they offer guided tours on Lake Hanabanilla which has some good size fish."
