761467,BassAsin,2013-01-22 04:03:00,806,"awesome on you guys for tenting it.   wish I had of seen this post sooner.   a liter of water with a dozen dace minnows would have lasted the night, punch a few holes in the bottle and sink it overnight, wont freeze.  dew worms on a set line would have been a good idea as well.  none the less i'm surprised you didn't get any, its heavily stocked every two years and stocked in 2012, a handful of of small 10-14 inchers should have been hungry. although similar to brookies they can be picky.  weather change over the weekend likely didn't help.  hopefully the next report has just as nice of scenery and a few fish mixed in as well."
761493,singingdog,2013-01-22 11:51:00,1047,"That's trout fishing. It can be a real gamble putting a lot of effort into getting to a remote lake. If the bite is off, it doesn't matter how good the lake is. My guess is that the big weather change shut them down, but trout don't need much of an excuse to shut down."
761529,TJQ,2013-01-22 16:03:00,7806,Great pic of the crossing of the lake.
761531,DoubleDigits,2013-01-22 16:07:00,140,Amazing report! Thanks for sharing.
761581,castgame,2013-01-22 19:29:00,161,"  maybe next time i'll bring some minnows in out of desperation. i prefer to fish artificias only, but these splake are beginning to frustrate me!  you seem to know exactly where i ended up! how'd you manage that piece of deduction?"
761582,castgame,2013-01-22 19:30:00,161,"i'm thinking in retrospect i should have drilled a lot of holes in different locations right off the bat, and then let them sit a while before fishing them. in less than 10' of water, an auger grinding and piercing the ice has got to spook any fish nearby. i probably should have been coming back to pre-drilled holes after letting them sit an hour or so. it was tough, though, because with the low temps and blowing snow, holes were disappearing fast. oh well, i'll test this tactic next time in hopefully better conditions."
761640,chris.brock,2013-01-22 22:51:00,4053,"I also used the map to try and figure it out, comparing with my maps, I couldn't do it, your secret's still safe  no, cancel that, I got it, that's a great lake, for the size of it, they stock alot of splake in there"
761648,castgame,2013-01-22 23:20:00,161,"haha i figured a couple clever folks might put it together yeah it sure looks good considering stocking numbers, the size of the lake, and the relatively low fishing pressure. i bet you couldn't get a sled in there most years unless there's some access i don't know"
762061,BassAsin,2013-01-24 04:47:00,806,i have my ways  many splake lake trout and specks i have caught have been immediately after drilling a hole. often in less than 3 fow.   going back to them never hurts.  worms may also be a good way to entice a picky trout. hopefully next trip in is more successful.
762065,irishfield,2013-01-24 05:00:00,26272,All I see is  Scoobie Doo !  That said.. splake... suspect similar to square tails.. I'd be fishing the 5 to 6 fow around the shore line and waiting for them to make their lap around the lake.
762169,castgame,2013-01-24 17:54:00,161,"thanks for the tips. next time i'll focus more on the shallows. i think i'll also bring a bigger assortment of jigs. do you reckon 3"" is too big? i was thinking i might entice some of the class of 2008"
762201,bdox,2013-01-24 19:26:00,329,"Great report. Looking forward to getting into the back country this winter.  BTW, it was pretty fun trying to figure out which lake you were on, but I think you might have made it a bit too easy"
762270,huntinnut,2013-01-24 23:39:00,3,"I think having a bait line each might have produced a couple fish.  Just having a second line out each couldn't have hurt, and having worms and minnows would have given a couple extra choices."
762692,castgame,2013-01-26 04:18:00,161," maybe so. a half dozen posters now know you can walk for 3 hours into this lake, fish it all day long, and not get a hit"
762700,irishfield,2013-01-26 04:39:00,26272,LOL Cast... I can get there in 50 minutes.. from my yard!!   Just find a good spot...so I know where to slide up to and park!!
762711,adempsey,2013-01-26 05:25:00,1498,"Nice report and photos!   Looks like a good time to me!  Too bad no fish.   That's the story of my life though, lol.  Still doesn't lower my enthusiasm one bit!  Looking at the depth map of that lake it looks like a tough one for Splake IMO.  It's fairly deep.   Not sure where I would start.  I see a few points that drop off pretty fast, so I'd probably start with those in <10 FOW.  My experience (in fall at least ) is similar to what Irishfield said.   They seem to just make laps around the lake or something because the fish are there for a bit and then vanish."
762734,castgame,2013-01-26 14:01:00,161,depth map? where'd you find a depth map?!
762737,SirCranksalot,2013-01-26 14:19:00,3291,I guess I'm the only 1 on here who doesn't know what lake that is!!  Have you looked at the FishOn site or Anglers atlas for a contour map?
762760,castgame,2013-01-26 16:01:00,161, couldn't find either of those
763003,SirCranksalot,2013-01-27 22:27:00,3291,Try these.  http://www.web2.mnr.gov.on.ca/fish_online/fishing/fishingExplorer_en.html  http://www.anglersatlas.com/mapsearch/   If I knew the name of the lake I could check it out. You could probably post the name of the lake here w/o any problem. Folks are unlikely to flock there given that you were skunked.
760106,castgame,2013-01-17 19:14:00,161,"buddy and i will be snowshoeing/camping on a back lake this weekend just south of algonquin on a splake lake. i was hoping to get some OFC community tips on:  a] ice quality up there right now -- the temps look perfect but you can't be too careful! think i can expect safe ice this saturday? b] fishing splakes with artificials. my plan was to start close in to shoreline that looks structured, and progressively move from 5' of water to probably 40' of water until we find the fish. will be jigging small spoons (krocs, cleos, wobblers) and white plastic grubs and spoons. my question is this: where in the water column do you jig? and when do you get the hit -- on the fall, when the lure's suspended, on the rise? how aggressively should i be jigging?  thanks in advance. i'll have pictures and a report when i'm thawed and back to civilization next week!"
760145,Jds63,2013-01-17 21:06:00,1365,"I got 2 this season ... one was caught jigging agressivley with a small spoon tipped with minnow and the second one was caught using a tipup setup ... splitshot, hook and minnow .. both in about 12 ft of water"
760198,chris.brock,2013-01-17 23:52:00,4053,"they're a hybrid but fish them more like brookies, I would suggest 6 to 15 feet of water like JDS said, I wouldn't bother going out to 40 feet  if you're fishing shallow, fish the middle of the water column  you're allowed 2 lines too, it may be worth it to bring in some minnows and tip-ups"
760207,castgame,2013-01-18 00:39:00,161, where in the water column were you? just off bottom?  what i really want to know is how do i work a jig or spoon through the ice?
760208,castgame,2013-01-18 00:41:00,161,thanks but because i'm tenting it they'd freeze overnight for sure  how aggressively do i jig? when would i expect the hit?
760212,chris.brock,2013-01-18 00:52:00,4053,"some guys are likely more knowledgeable, but do medium aggressive jigging, about 3 foot lifts, a hit could happen anytime (at the top, on the drop, on the rise)  for the minnows, powder snow is a great insulator against freezing  tenting eh?, you guys are hardcore, post a trip report when you get back, sounds like a cool adventure"
760213,Joeytier,2013-01-18 00:53:00,3990,"I would definitely suggest bringing minnows, but 2 to 3 inch bright tubes will produce, as well as just about any small to medium sized flutter spoon.  My general rule of thumb is less then 10 FOW, sometimes less than 5, but the water is very clear, then they could easily be taken in excess of twenty feet.  Look for mud flats and deep timber, and you should find some fish."
760214,Joeytier,2013-01-18 00:53:00,3990,"Also, frozen minnows on a deadstick can be deadly as well."
760231,castgame,2013-01-18 01:48:00,161," good thought on the snow! though i still don't think i want to carry in two dozen shiners plus the gallon of water on the 10km snowshoe in  provided my camera doesn't freeze shut, i'll definitely post some pictures. won't be my first time tenting and ice fishing, but i hope it's the most productive on the fish front"
760247,NAW,2013-01-18 02:45:00,4022,"We had planned a trip up this weekend with the snowmobile.  But decided to push it out a week or two to make sure.  Don't want to waste a day because of crappy ice or conditions.  The ice should be good for walking.  Post an ice report when you get back if you don't mind   From you general area, we where going to hit the same lake this weekend.  Would have been funny..  I can't remember what they where hitting last year.  I think it was a tinny wax worm beetle thingy.  Red.  In the 10' range.  Lightly jigging off bottom.  Only bringing it up a foot or two.  Half way up the odd time to raise some attention."
760249,chris.brock,2013-01-18 02:48:00,4053,"as for ice quality, you'll be fine, I bet there will be 10"" on smaller lakes up there this weekend"
760299,Iamcanadian,2013-01-18 08:37:00,14,Ice conditions will be fine. Not sure what lake your fishing but a lot of small back lakes Just south of the park and north of Haliburton have been shut down in the last year or so.They been bought up and no fishing has been allowed.Even if they were stocked by the mnr you will be tresspassing.There is no crown land between the village of Haliburton and north to the park
760363,SirCranksalot,2013-01-18 15:52:00,3291,"and then tent!! Note to self: If invited, never ever go fishing with this guy!!"
760411,castgame,2013-01-18 18:34:00,161,"double checked the regs -- no mention of the lake should mean it's open for splake year round. not private land, so not trespassing. that's as much as i'm gonna say it's just a matter of gear. plus, how could you get an earlier start than waking up 20m from your holes??"
760514,chris.brock,2013-01-19 00:23:00,4053,"interesting, did a big parcel of land get bought up between Fort Irwin and Whitney?  Crown land doesn't seem to get sold off"
760522,Rod Caster,2013-01-19 00:53:00,5784,"If you want to catch more fish than everyone else in your party, use these in brown and add a tiny chuck of minnow or worm:  http://www.ebay.com/itm/NEW-NORTHLAND-SCUD-BUG-FRESHWATER-SHRIMP-ICE-FISHING-JIG-LURE-/321035635814?pt=LH_DefaultDomain_0&hash=item4abf370c66  5 to 20 fow. Look for downed trees on shoreline abutting shallow flats."
760545,Christopheraaron,2013-01-19 02:11:00,3525,"Skunked, couldn't mark a fish all day, fished from 5ft all the way to 100ft using live minnows, frozen minnows, small tubes and twister tails, just couldn't find them. Oh well, pike and perch tomorrow"
760601,singingdog,2013-01-19 13:17:00,1047,There are still plenty of public-access lakes in between Haliburton and Algonquin.
761390,castgame,2013-01-22 00:31:00,161,"back from the trip in. we had a total blast despite the plummeting temps, and an overnight storm that brought high winds, tons of snow, and even thunder and lightning! that was a first for me to camp through. here are some pics from the weekend:     loaded up and 'shoeing in to the first lake to cross    there was a surprising amount of open water. we watched two sleds scoot over this thin bit here. the water was only waist deep so i wasn't worried, but still walked carefully and quickly.    a river we needed to cross. this took a little bushwhacking"
761396,castgame,2013-01-22 00:40:00,161, getting the first holes drilled for the last of the evening's light    our site's on the island   tent pre-storm   tent in the morning  
761405,castgame,2013-01-22 00:47:00,161," sunday was a clear, cold, windy day. constant 60kph gusts coming straight across the lake. made for beautiful but difficult conditions     the walk out after the snowfall   the long trudge back over a windy lake"
761409,castgame,2013-01-22 00:54:00,161,"the trip was beautiful and remote and should have ended with many pictures of trophy splake, but as you can see, there aren't any because we got 100% skunked. we must have put down 30 holes all over that lake off every kind of point, island, stream, downed tree, cliff, and otherwise. fished 3"" white grubs, 3"" white tube jigs, and small spoons (blue and silver cleos and wobblers) in every part of the water column. we mostly stuck to 5-20 fow so maybe we should have gone deeper, but the conditions were brutal and our window of time was relatively short. i don't know if the fish were just shut right down or if we were doing something wrong, but we couldn't buy a hit. oh well. the journey was incredible and i'd do it all over again! maybe next time for ice-out..."
761416,castgame,2013-01-22 01:12:00,161, approximate locations of holes we fished. would any of you guys done anything differently? that stream on the left of this picture is an inflow -- i wanted to put a couple holes down near the mouth but it was fairly shallow (3'-6') and i wasn't too confident in the quality of the ice around current.
