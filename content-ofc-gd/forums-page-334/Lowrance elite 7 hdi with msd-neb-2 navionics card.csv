I am especially interested in the unit that comes with the navionics msd/neb-2 card, and if that card shows decent detail etc. I mainly fish Geo. Bay from Owen Sound to Tobermory + Lake Huron - Port Elgin to Stokes Bay area.  Thank you for your responses Muskett50"
762943,muskett50,2013-01-27 14:28:00,2,I was able to borrow a buddies msd/2xg card and it would appear that the msd/neb-2 card has the same detail as the msd/2xg card.  Thanks anyway
