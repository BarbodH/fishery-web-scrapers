762569,Handlebarz,2013-01-25 21:52:00,3790,When we is Canadians learn to NOT use UPS for shipments to Canada I learned fast and Never use them for items coming from out of country. Heck we have had problems here also with them delivering the package I would here the knock at door get up go right out to check who is there and they are gone and the sticky note is there telling you to go pick it up tomorrow and the guy is just pulling away. No use for them in my house
762577,Canuck2fan,2013-01-25 22:57:00,1444,"USPS / Canada Post all the way for any imported items, both FedEX and UPS must be on some serious drugs when they come up with their ""brokerage/duty"" fees. I will never understand how simply signing a declaration can translate into a charge for 50% of the cost of some items with those clowns.  USPS charges nothing for the same service and if customs here doesn't open it no fees are attached at all."

I see these truck's daily, i still see guys standing on parcel's trying to reach for high items in the truck..they don't give a damn, in the truck off the truck end of day.

762981,I'mHooked,2013-01-27 19:50:00,525,Wow this is interesting.  We've been using UPS at work for shipments from US to Canada on average 3 times per week for the last 15 years and have not had a single shipment go missing or have any major issue. They've been quite reliable in my experience. That's not to say it isn't more costly when they clear your occasional package for you. We have a seperate customs broker so the only cost from UPS is the courier cost itself which hasn't been unreasonable. You definitely want to switch to a freight company though when you're getting close to 80 lbs or more.

762991,bassfighter,2013-01-27 21:12:00,366,"I order and get item ship using USPS to a mail box address across the Lewiston border, have lunch across, get some cheap gas, then fish at whirlpool niagara to maximize my day. The mail box company charge $5 per package, lots of Canadians use the address to buy goods in US, they provide a ### number, not a P.O. box number, so Many seller at ebay will ship for free to this address.  UPS shipping charge very inexpensive for corporation in the US, such as cabelas or bass pro, sometimes cheaper than USPS. Most companies do not have time to drop off package to local post office, too costly for anyone. So they prefer UPS to pick them up at their store, seller assumed they are doing Canadians favor by using UPS, the rate seems to be comparable and faster than USPS.  Since most US companies' employee do not understand importation duties added to shipment to other countries, they chose UPS.  This is where UPS takes advantage of the situation and charge unsuspecting Canadians brokerage fees and duties, HST taxes to receiver. Even products under free warranty replacement get brokerage fees added if full value gets declared, since the shipper wants to declare the goods at full value to take advantage of free insurance covered for the first $100 value. I always have to quibble and deny receiving package from UPS, I then call the warranty company to re-declare the package to no value or no charge for Free replacement.  Corporation sometimes rectify the issue with UPS and no brokerage fees corrected, many times, the shipper just end up paying the brokerage fees and duties just to release the goods sooner, since some shipping employees are just too lazy to re-file other kinds of UPS paperwork. Corporation employee has so much things to worry about, and very few employee working in the shipping department care about items shipped to other countries.  We all learn from our past mistakes dealing with UPS......................for me..............always enquire before buying in USA! Calculate potential added expense when buying goods in US. Many goods bought in US is not under warranty in Canada. However, US warranty are way more reliable than Canadian warranty base on my experience. Easier to bad mouth a company in US via on line, so US companies seem to take care of customer service better if they knew their reputation might be jeoperdize."
763001,Steve,2013-01-27 22:05:00,2075,would never ever use UPS again.  products when they arrive at the door cost 40%-70% more because of their rediculous freight charges.  i hope sellers understand why the customers will not purchase if they choose to use UPS.

The US postal service turns shipments over to Canada post direct. You can arrange for tracking at various levels through the postal service.  Being in the logistics industry I have to deal with these guys daily.  I wont give them (UPS) my business personally. There are other options out there be it personal or business, but they are hard to find (DHL is one, depending on the service areas.)  The customs duties charged by these carriers is nothing more than a cash grab. There is a streamlined release system by CBSA that permits them to process these entries very easliy. http://www.cbsa-asfc.gc.ca/import/courier/lvs-efv/menu-eng.html  (if you care).  You also have the option to ship in bond and process it yourself ( if the carrier will support). You will however need lots of patience and the ability to be at a customs office for several hours duing business hours. Personally - I would  rather just pay my local tackle shop to bring it in for me . I support my neighbour, who uses a Canadian based customs broker with whom he has preferential rates (creating employment for more neighbours) and I dont have to deal with anything Big Brown (kind of appropriate name) . Some headaches just arent worth $20.00 - and well, if they are charging you $75 or more for brokerage fees........ Just my $0.02."
763028,Handlebarz,2013-01-28 00:30:00,3790,Well UPS got me I had a package sent to a friends in Ohio it was to be delivered Friday but when I checked to be sure it made it go figure they can not even get it right in there own country. They forgot part of the address so it was undeliverable what the hell. I wish I had known it was sent UPS I would have asked for USPS which is how this store sends to me in Canada. Thanks UPMS
763203,John,2013-01-28 18:12:00,2956,NEVER EVER use UPS for cross border shipments. We have debated this to death over the past few years and 95% of it is negative.
763230,aplumma,2013-01-28 20:06:00,6896,  I don't get it I live in the US and get parts and material thru UPS all of the time 4 to 6 times a week and have had only one package arrive beat up in 3 years. It was packed correctly so no damage was found. I do find that the cost of shipping is getting to high but it is across the board all of the shipping companies are going up due to fuel and expenses. I hope that UPS can get things straightened out up North because the company appears to be solid down here. I however have to say that till they do I will still continue sending things up North thru USPS it seems to be easier for you all to receive.
425684,DRIFTER_016,2010-01-25 18:22:00,10439,"So I ordered a Sage spey blank from Cabelas a couple of weeks ago as they had them in the bargain cave for 25% off. The only shipping method allowed was international air at $44.95 which they send UPS. At least with Cabelas you know all the charges up front and know you won't be boned by UPS when your package arrives. Well when my package hadn't arrived by Friday of last week I call up Cabelas and ask what's up with my order. They look it up in the system and say it was delivered on Wednesday and so & so signed for it at such & such address. I tell her well that's not me and not my address. She tells me that yeah it was supposed to go to my address. She tells me that she can send me another blank, I tell her that's fine but I bet you don't have any. I was right. So she is recalling the order which takes up to a week, hopefully. Once the blank is back in Sydney Nebraska it will be re-sent to me. What a deal!!!!! I pay $44.95 for shipping and it could take a month to get my parcel from those UPS Losers that can't even deliver to the right address. What really burns me is if for some reason they don't get it back I will still be out $300 for the components I ordered for this build from other vendors. Thanks again UPS!!!!!!!

I’ve been bent over and violated up the yin yang by them more than a few times.  My last order was hilarious:  Albright Tackle (located in NY State) sends my package via UPS (even after I told them to ship USPS).  Called it in when I got my tracking number to cancel and reship…Albright cancelled the UPS delivery and told them to bring it back…I saw my tracking history state that the delivery was cancelled and somewhere in Syracuse, NY.  Next day, I see the package arrive at the US/CAN border in Buffalo and make its way into Canada where it sits for a few days during the week…WTH?  The record of the cancellation was gone.  Friday, the package makes its way to Concord, Ontario…Then to Scarborough…Then back to Concord.  Monday, the UPS man comes to my door with the package asking for $77 in customs/brokerage for a package valued at $135 Canadian.  I told him I canceled the order almost 10 business days prior (which it did take to get to my door – 5 day guarantee was a joke in any case)…Told the delivery guy I only ship USPS because of the brokerage fees…He tells me to ship by UPS air – That option would’ve cost me $150 for shipping but I wouldn’t have to pay brokerage fees  I cancel the order and my package goes from Concord, Ontario to Buffalo (and back to Concord another time)…Then to Ohio   …Then to Kentucky  …4wks after I made the order, the rods finally got back to Albright Tackle.  Albright ships via USPS the same day and I get the package in 4 business days.  Could be just me…I have the worst luck dealing with UPS and FedEx.  Beyond the outrageous brokerage fees, they also lost a number of my packages…Most notable was a high-end carp blank – US vendor only had 1 in inventory…How the heck do you lose a 6ft long, bright chartreuse painted rod tube? I don’t know…FedEx still wanted me to pay $72 in customs/brokerage fees after they lost that one  PS  Which spey blank did you order?  Currently looking for a switch/shorter spey rod myself...Have an 11ft 7/8 Meiser switch blank on the short-list...Dreading the news on how much it's going to cost me to get it over the border."

425775,Terry,2010-01-25 21:55:00,14456,I have seen where there is no duty on an item but UPS put broker fees at 3/4 of the price of the thing you bought

Many thanks.  Haven’t decided which blank I want yet and probably won’t for another couple of months.  Finding the right fly rod blank is a lot harder than I thought…Meiser, Beulah, CTS, Rainshadow, Winston, Sage…Only got enough funds for 1 along with the components I want to use in the build.  If anything changes, I'll let you know ASAP  I heard someone in BC started a lawsuit against UPS for their insane brokerage fees a couple years ago…Not sure how that’s going.

425827,smitter,2010-01-26 00:36:00,106,"I do as Dara suggests and have all my packages shipped to a P.O. box in Michigan. No brokerage fees if you act as your own broker.  As for UPS, how's this. Last year I bought a truck rack from an American company. It gets shipped UPS, I go pick it up in Soo Michigan, bring it back, no problem.  The box was a little beat up, and taped back together, I open the box up at home and it had some parts that didn't really make much sense.  My truck rack came with a dozen hummingbird feeder stands stuffed in it. There was a separate shipping invoice for the hummingbird feeder stands. Apparently they were bound for a garden center in Petoskey Michigan. I called them, they said they were not worth worrying about.  I guess during shipping, some boxes must have fell and broken open. Buddy the diligent UPS employee simply grabbed the spilt merchandise and shoved it into whatever box it fit into, tapped it all back together and put it back on the truck. So I've got 12 hummingbird feeder stands that I don't know what to do with. At least all the truck rack parts were there. Too bad it wasn't a plasma screen TV or a new fishfinder or something."
762448,doser,2013-01-25 15:25:00,7,I refuse all UPS shipments and have all my suppliers ship USPS.  I called UPS and asked if they could ban my address from receiving packages but they said they couldn't do that.  UPS in the states is great.  Many many years ago when UPS was only allowed to deliver by refurbished taxis I joined a group fighting to get UPS into Canada.  We wrote to members of parliment and finally they were allowed to operate in Canada.  I just showed my age.  Little did I know they would be ripping Canadians off with outlandish brokerage fees.  One $75 package I got had duty and fees of almost $200 because the shipper inflated the value of the package.  I think he was hoping it got lost and he would make a killing on the insurance.

762473,SirCranksalot,2013-01-25 17:22:00,3291,"Same here. I get confirmation that they ship via USPS/Canada Post before I order. A few extra days for delivery is seldom a problem. Couriers in general either  (a) leave the pkg outside in the elements w/ a sig. ( leave a card for me to drive a considerable dist to pick up. With Canada Post it's either in a big locked bin below the mailbox or 2  km down the road at the PO Outlet.

And how many of us would like UPS to just drop the package at the front door... sure a $2k guitar is sitting on my front step, for the world to take... and they probably would, if the guitar hadn't already been dropped 20 ft at the distribution centre... such a deal to pay brokerage fees for a busted up instrument!
