575186,Fish Farmer,2011-04-22 13:48:00,2234,"I've fished the Fest for 30 years and never seen so little amount of boats. 4 days of snow, rain, cold and wet. Lots of fish caught in the marinas but all small. No tags or keepers were caught in our group of 8 guys. One day we had snow ball fights in the boats. There has been 4 tags caught as of Wed. Man was it nice to get back to the motel after a day of freezing and getting wet. We hit the sauna,hot tub,pool then the coolers Some people call us crazy fisherman but do we have a get time.   back at the motel we look back and say boy it's nice to get away with the buds, even if it's just Perchin.

575297,lookinforwalleye,2011-04-22 20:26:00,4399,Looks like fun!!!
575300,misfish,2011-04-22 20:37:00,29133,"It,s all about the gathering.  Im sure some old stories were told over an over again,as the nights went on."
575303,lookinforwalleye,2011-04-22 20:53:00,4399,  Yes I hear ya Brian I have been known to go on a fishing trip or two where the fishing was secondary!!!
575306,Roy,2011-04-22 21:18:00,13728, HA! You too?
575307,Roy,2011-04-22 21:19:00,13728,"Glad you and your buds had a good time, Dave."
575339,Leecher,2011-04-22 22:47:00,7832,That's purely extreme Dave Just doesn't get any better than that Good on you guys
575341,bigugli,2011-04-22 22:49:00,6138,"Just wouldn't be perchfest without snow, sleet and the occassional wind storm. Done my share of those."
575356,pics,2011-04-22 23:27:00,1268,I was thinking of you guys Dave!!...That was some nasty weather....
575357,lookinforwalleye,2011-04-22 23:34:00,4399,"  Oh ya, we used to do an annual Nippising ice fishing trip and there was one guy that never saw the ice 3 straight years!"
575368,pikehunter,2011-04-23 00:19:00,1659,Damn! I got goose pimples lookin' at those pics At least you were dressed for it  Nice to get away all the same and I'm sure that there were some good times and the weather made the trip unforgetable.
575369,Fish Farmer,2011-04-23 00:21:00,2234,"Thanks Guys. I sure tell ya, was nice to get back to the Motel and your right, some of the stories I've heard a dozen times but you still laugh, could be the refreshments.   We're really looking for the tags, not to take fish home. 2 of the guys wanted a few for a feed but it was slim pickins for keepers. A lot of the ones they kept had a lot of worms in the filet's, that turned a few of the guys off for ever keeping perch anymore. Give me Erie Perch any time over Simcoe."
575381,misfish,2011-04-23 01:01:00,29133, Stay home then ya bugger.Stop tormenting our perch.LOL       Aleast yer honest.  Good luck.
575383,canuckjack,2011-04-23 01:15:00,121,You guys are far too hardcore  I tried to go out Monday and the wind and cold sent me packing before the line even got wet and that was nothing compared to what you guys were fishing in.
575385,Michael_Brown,2011-04-23 01:17:00,411,That's diehard.  Glad you had fun with friends.
