I see all kinds of threads where OFC members talk about the good work CO's are doing despite sad budget cuts. I'll thow this out there to see if anyone has a solid idea on how to do this....  We have an upcoming provincial election. What if OFC members got together and stood up as a voice to support the cause of hiring more CO's? I am a gov't employee (unionized - not related to environment) and admit there is bloated areas, but I think we absolutely need more CO's on the water to enforce the laws.  I think we could easily get some media coverage (local TV, radio, OFAH) and I know we can get some OPSEU union support. We can plug OFC too. Anyone have any ideas? Even if it is a meet and greet. Although I'm thinking something with kids is the way to go. Maybe an inof meeting for SRT8's idea for a kids fishing camp to support one of our own too would be good.  With the blessing of Terry of course though. Didn't ask Terry or SRT8 before I posted."
