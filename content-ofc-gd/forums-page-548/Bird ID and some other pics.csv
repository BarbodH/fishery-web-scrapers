575683,Joey,2011-04-24 02:03:00,9122,"This guy landed in the tree out the back.  These are terrible shots as they are through a screen and window.  I'm torn between hawk or falcon.  Most probably a hawk though.  Can anyone confirm what kind?          Went for a walk after supper and they had redone the park down the street.  To my delight, this was the new kids playground mascot.  Thought they did a really good job of it.          Then just played with the camera settings and took a few random shots down the path.                Thanks for looking,  Joey"
575686,DRIFTER_016,2011-04-24 02:08:00,10439,"Ok, where is this? I'll be right over with me wrenches. This bad boy would look good over my gate.  "
575688,Joey,2011-04-24 02:10:00,9122," Well ya better bring a semi, cause its about 20 feet long if not longer"
575695,Whitespinnerbait,2011-04-24 02:28:00,2038,Nice Pics..  Looks like a Coopers Hawk
575708,Leecher,2011-04-24 03:17:00,7832,Un faucon.... oopppss    sorry Joey.... what whitespinnerbait said... hawk
575730,Live2fish85,2011-04-24 04:47:00,1633,"Nice pictures, I like the ones of the water running over the rocks did you slow the shutter speed down for them?"
575746,Spiel,2011-04-24 12:36:00,9065,"Appears to be a Coopers Hawk Joey, I see them quite often around my yard.  Some great pictures as well, good shoot'n."
575757,Twocoda,2011-04-24 13:24:00,4130,that Maskot is awesome...i want one too...  nice shootin with the camera...looks like your preparing yourself some some cool expressions with it in the future...  Have fun
575758,Terry,2011-04-24 13:28:00,14456,cool shots   you know someone is going to steal the fish  most likely tonight   between 1 and 2    if traffic is good  LOL
575759,Dave Bailey,2011-04-24 13:33:00,1641,"Hard to tell about the bird without something for a size reference, but it's either a cooper's hawk or a sharp-shinned hawk, both in the accipiter group, and with almost identical plumage.  It doesn't look like the correct profile for a goshawk, another accipiter which is much larger. Plus it appears as though the streaking on the breast is reddish, common to both smaller species, the much larger goshawk has grey streaking. As in most falconiformes the females are bigger than the males, and the female sharp-shinned is about the same size as a male cooper's."
575790,dave524,2011-04-24 14:55:00,4508," Exactly, there is always one round here that thinks my bird feeder is its own private smorgasboard"
575791,Joey,2011-04-24 15:04:00,9122," Yes, I did, and it was the first time I've ever tried it.  You have to be really motionless      Terry, I dare ya"
575794,irishfield,2011-04-24 15:34:00,26272, Will that Jeep of yours pull my 32' deck trailer Terry... or do you need my truck as well?
575795,Terry,2011-04-24 15:57:00,14456,your truck might be better.....I could use a copilot too
575796,Roy,2011-04-24 16:04:00,13728, AKA an accomplice.
575803,Twocoda,2011-04-24 16:35:00,4130,if you need help filleting it up ...ive got a few saw zalls with really LOOOOOONG blades
576009,Jewelbee,2011-04-25 08:28:00,422,Beautiful photos Joey!!
576015,Terry,2011-04-25 10:47:00,14456,
576020,Roy,2011-04-25 11:17:00,13728,"Nice Liberty, Terry. A 60 footer eh?"
576023,Terry,2011-04-25 11:29:00,14456,well there was nothing in her photo to give me perspective ...  was it at the top of a ladder (3 ft)or was it over the entire play equipment (30ft)  and it's 40 ft long 
576024,Grimace,2011-04-25 11:30:00,2020,Almost impossible to tell the difference between a Sharp Shinned Hawk and a Coopers except the tail.  Everyone always tends to want what they see to be a Coopers because of their rarity but it is very hard to tell.
576033,corvette1,2011-04-25 11:58:00,1765,nice pictures joey
576092,Joey,2011-04-25 15:05:00,9122,"Thanks all, I'm finally starting to learn this camera.  Alot more to it than I realized  The hawk confused me I guess because it was so grey.  The ones I usually see are so brown.  Guess I need to do some hawk research.    Terry, here's some perspective, that is a child's head at the bottom, he/she is on a bicycle.    Joey"
576101,Carp,2011-04-25 15:20:00,1488,Nice pics Joey. Not sure about the bird I.D.
