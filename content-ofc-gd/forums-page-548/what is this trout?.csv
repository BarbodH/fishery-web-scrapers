575997,hurraylien,2011-04-25 03:46:00,95,i think this is a laker but it doesn't have the forked tail.anyone it was caught in goderich
575999,DRIFTER_016,2011-04-25 04:01:00,10439,Brook Trout.
576001,irishfield,2011-04-25 04:03:00,26272,I'z gonna say Splake.
576002,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2011-04-25 04:04:00,0,definite speck.  not usually a good idea to keep a fish when you don't know the species!
576003,irishfield,2011-04-25 04:09:00,26272,Lucas makes a great point when Brookies and Splake are both closed season fishies in Zone 13.. so if you had of caught that at the river mouth you'd be tatooed... but upstream or inland you're fortunately safe.
576005,hurraylien,2011-04-25 04:11:00,95,i didn't keep it it was someone else's stringer they thought it was a brown.I didn't really expect a speckle at the mouth there.That's why i thought maybe laker
576006,hurraylien,2011-04-25 04:13:00,95,i also questioned the validity of the catch but just thought it would be a good pic :/
576067,BillM,2011-04-25 14:05:00,17367,Huron has coasters!!
576068,Jacob,2011-04-25 14:08:00,186,Looks like a splake to me
576071,Roy,2011-04-25 14:13:00,13728,Speck....fresh out of Huron.
576074,Musky or Specks,2011-04-25 14:22:00,2710,Speck. Biological Drift from one of countless tribs that contain specks. Fish moves into the main river in the fall and feeds and roam while the river is comfortable temp for it. Specks are very good at homing back into springs as the water warms and actually exists for periods of time in some of the bigger rivers.
