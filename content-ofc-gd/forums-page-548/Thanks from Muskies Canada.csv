575903,Handlebarz,2011-04-24 23:33:00,3790,I have to say thanks to everyone that came out and supported the Odyssey and Handlebarz musky lures. We had a great time and sold alot of lures which I hope the people will return the pictures to us from there trips this year.  It was great to have so many people passing through the event I had lost my voice Sunday morning if you can believe that LOL the wife was happy  The amount of families that were there was also great to see I know with the ones I talked with they were all happy to spend $20 for the family to get into the show and no charge for parking it was a HUGE hit. Lots of young musky hunters there and it was awesome to listen to each of there stories. Some may have been over excited and have VIDEO to prove it LOL.  I am looking forward to it again in two year time.  Thanks again to everyone who put it on.  Cheers Mike
