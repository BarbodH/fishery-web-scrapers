Even so, a few fish were landed. Even the peanut and I managed one for the team.   Despite the poor bite, I was in great company. In all a thoroughly enjoyable day."

With the water temp still only 48o F the bite was slow for sure. I did get to see a decent pike landed on a fly rod, that was an bonus. As usual with our fish-ins we get people popping by to fish a bit during the day or just to say hi. All are welcome."
