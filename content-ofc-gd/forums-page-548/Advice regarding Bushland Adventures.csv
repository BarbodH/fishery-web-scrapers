575843,Tomcat,2011-04-24 19:58:00,395,"Two weeks ago, I received an invitation to participate in a 2012 fishing trip to Lake Evans in north western Quebec. I recently started my due diligence on Americree Ltd, an outfitter on the lake. While the primary target is trophy northern pike (catch and release only), the secondary target is walleye to help provide sustenance during the week. I'd appreciate hearing from any OFNers that have experience on the lake or with the outfitter. I'm aware of the controversy between the current principals and the former principals associated with similar domain names. As well as sharing your experiences with the lake, the fishing, the accommodations, the locations of the outpost camps, etc. I'd appreciate learning about your experiences with Americree Ltd., the new outfitter/owner since 2008. Whether you post in response or send me a PM, all information will be much appreciated. Thanks in advance."
