575055,scugpg,2011-04-21 23:42:00,1373,"I was wondering if anyone knows where I can source walleye jigs like in the attached pic. Note the Green and Black jigs. They seem to have a black/dark silver hook on them that is strong, sharp and doesn't rust anywhere near some of the other ones out there. If anyone knows where I can source these in multiple colours and sizes let me know.  Thanks.  "

575136,archie_james_c,2011-04-22 04:45:00,618,Ive switched over to Lindy Exchange jigs almost exclusively. Very high quality hooks (points dont deform in the rocks) and you can swap weights/colours whenever you need

575158,scugpg,2011-04-22 11:22:00,1373, Lol yes it's just there as an example it has the cheaper hook on it
575161,watertight,2011-04-22 11:25:00,50,They look like Mustad hooks that are available at www.luremaking.com  if you knew someone with jig molds. I'd help you out but I don't have the hooks at the moment.
