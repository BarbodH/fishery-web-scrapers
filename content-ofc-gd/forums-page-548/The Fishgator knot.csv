574244,Garry2Rs,2011-04-19 21:09:00,1425,This is an interesting new knot that is well thought out. The knot is designed so that it doesn't cut itself. You might like to give it a try. 
574246,MSBruno,2011-04-19 21:16:00,369,"interesting, thanks.  Going to run it through some strength tests soon."
574248,Rod Caster,2011-04-19 21:24:00,5784,"Just tried it. I like it a lot. Like the guy said, it's a very tidy knot and leaves only the smallest nub of line at the hook. Very stealthy and seems strong. Thx for the post"
574250,misfish,2011-04-19 21:31:00,29133,"Thanks Garry. Seems to be none complicated and I,ll give it a try.   TFS"
574261,Joey,2011-04-19 22:00:00,9122,"Looks interesting, I'll have to give that a try.  Thanks!"
574262,BillM,2011-04-19 22:09:00,17367,Very cool.  Skip the first minute of the video if you don't wanna here the guy ramble on
574263,GBW,2011-04-19 22:17:00,8460,it looks like a good one to me too
574264,Muskieman,2011-04-19 22:17:00,2472,I like it!!... I just tied it onto a jig and love it... very tidy and quick to tie.. I tried to take a picture but ya can't see the line....  Randy 
574267,BillM,2011-04-19 22:25:00,17367,"Randy, use the macro feature on your digital camera.  Should have no problem picking up the knot!"
574270,Muskieman,2011-04-19 22:28:00,2472, going to try it now........
574272,fishindude,2011-04-19 22:33:00,220,Just tried it on a few hooks and I like it as well. Gonna give it a go this season to see how it holds up against the trusty palomar. Thanks Garry2Rs
574282,bassjnkie,2011-04-19 22:49:00,1101,"Tried it and it's a real easy, clean knot. Thumbs up."
574284,Muskieman,2011-04-19 22:53:00,2472,"This first picture is 6Lb Trilene XL tied to a jig using the Fisherman's Knot... my ""go to"" knot..   #2 is 30Lb Seaguar Fluoro...on the very same jig.  The knot seems to be about the same size..   I've tied it 10 times or more now and am confident that this will be a useful knot in my arsenal..  Randy "
574285,Muskieman,2011-04-19 22:55:00,2472," I don't have a MACRO... ""Close Up"" only.. seems to have worked"
574289,Rod Caster,2011-04-19 23:01:00,5784,"Nice, you just gave away the secret Nipissing lure.  As an all-purpose knot, I think I like this one more than the trilene knot. I'll have to field test it first before I switch though."
574297,Roy,2011-04-19 23:14:00,13728,Randy! Your hands are brand new! Do you work?
574299,GBW,2011-04-19 23:24:00,8460,we call those 'typest hands' Roy...
574303,Live2fish85,2011-04-19 23:29:00,1633,"Thanks for that I have tried it and it's not much hard then a palmor knot, I will try this out for sure it may work alright for drop shoting so the hook sit up right.  "
574309,misfish,2011-04-19 23:44:00,29133," Naw,he just does the dishes,like any good man would do for his better half."
574319,Fisherman,2011-04-20 00:08:00,7201,"Well it works, however, I think I need some trifocals and a serious case of hand warming to make that one in cold weather.  I'll stick to the palomar."
574405,PikeMolester,2011-04-20 03:25:00,428,Nice thanks. Very simple and I will be replacing all my palomar knots with the fishgator knot.
575358,wallyboss,2011-04-22 23:35:00,1095,Has anybody tried it on braid???Does it slip?
