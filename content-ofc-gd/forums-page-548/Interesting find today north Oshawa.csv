575427,danc,2011-04-23 03:32:00,4677,I see half dead/rotten spring spawners (Chinnies) in Superior tribs every year.
575428,Kingsalmon,2011-04-23 03:40:00,107,"Back about ten years ago I caught a few spring run chinooks from a Georgian Bay trib.  One in particular was a bright silver hen about twenty pounds that almost spooled me in that river.  She went balistic right after she hit.  More aerial jumps and scorching runs than any steelhead I have ever caught.  Twenty minutes later I finally beached her.  Nickel bright and full of eggs.  Weird as hell.  I have seen many whitetail hens and moldy bucks on openers since then but never a nickel bright specimen.  So yes, its probably not a story.  I'll bet they surprise somebody tomorrow."
575741,Afraz,2011-04-24 09:52:00,250,"Not surprising, a buddy landed a baby Chinook which was almost black yesterday morning out of bowmanville creek. Must have been 6 - 8 lbs TOPS.  Still i wonder why they would run up in Spring, when they are supposed to spawn in fall. I guess it works both ways when trout follow the Salmon in during the fall, guess some crazy Salmon follow the trout up.  LOL - such illogical logic"
575120,bigredfisher,2011-04-22 03:03:00,300,"Hey I was taking a walk to check some bows out, did find lots but one thing I found was a pod of salmon .... And they weren't bows could see them very clearly . Has anyone ever seen this before??? I couldn't believe what I was seeing but it was salmon for sure"
575121,bigredfisher,2011-04-22 03:05:00,300,And at that way north(Winchester rd)
575124,Twocoda,2011-04-22 03:14:00,4130,Coho ? or lazy ole black chinnies that havent died yet?
575125,bigredfisher,2011-04-22 03:17:00,300,Light brown chinnies
575126,bigredfisher,2011-04-22 03:18:00,300,Looks like they ran up in the past 2 weeks
575129,John Bacon,2011-04-22 03:45:00,3277,I do recall reading that the Georgian Bays do get a very small run of spring Chinooks.  I understand that they get both spring and fall runs in B.C.  Did you happen to notice if they had adipose clips?
575134,Twocoda,2011-04-22 04:22:00,4130, maybe there is some validity to the story i heard yesterday
575182,GNODDY,2011-04-22 13:24:00,163,Possibly Atlantics?
575188,Michael_Brown,2011-04-22 13:52:00,411,"You never know what you may see north of Oshawa.     What size were the fish, bigger than average rainbows. I'm not sure what size Atlantics are when they enter the systems to spawn. It is OK, with the heavy rains tonight they should be offshore at Darlington by tomorrow morning."
575192,bigredfisher,2011-04-22 14:00:00,300,"They weren't Atlantics , unless there's 25 lb Atlantics"
575220,dave524,2011-04-22 15:53:00,4508,"Back in the late 80's when the MNR raised both Cohos and Chinook, what they did was to grab the Chinook eggs first and the Cohos after. What happened was they unintentionally bred for a later running strain of Cohos, the peak of the run would occur in the Credit in early Dec right up until it iced over. It was not uncommon to see a few around at spring thaw albeit in pretty advanced state. This is really late though even for those late spawners."
575224,GBW,2011-04-22 16:00:00,8460,don't you go fishing in my hole's off that rd...
575232,bigredfisher,2011-04-22 16:39:00,300,"Haha ha was just lookin don't plan on fishin that area on opener. There were a few but only in select pools and with the amount of guys gonna be there , I expect that stretch to be a dud"
575235,Sharkbait22,2011-04-22 16:52:00,297,  Very cool find. Try to get some pictures.  MNR and the local Conservation Authority would likely be interested. Was this Oshawa Creek?
575239,bigredfisher,2011-04-22 17:16:00,300,Yes upper stretch
575286,canadian_copper,2011-04-22 19:54:00,925,IN 20YRS OF FISHIN THAT CREEK IVE NEVER HEARD OR SEEN THAT. EXTREMELY INTERESTING. SURE THEY WERE BIG BROWNS?? WOULD OF BEEN NICE TO SEE A PIC. VERY INTERESTING INDEED

575299,misfish,2011-04-22 20:31:00,29133,"Way back, I used to fish Erindale this time of year and a bit earlier. I seen Cohos still trying to spawn."

575350,misfish,2011-04-22 22:58:00,29133," In all seriousness,I did see this. It was, to me at the time, crazy. Iced in river with pockets of open water and see these fish there . Man, to have a cam with you at that time."
