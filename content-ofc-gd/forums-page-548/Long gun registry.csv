If The Bloc used these tactics I would reference them  It's ABC  And again nobody has shown me where I can't go out tomorrow and buy a rifle if I wanted.  Be nice if this thread would go into lock-up---funny nobody brings this on here till someone smells an election  Again ABC---Politically motivated---this is'nt about anyones rights to own a rifle.
575214,ch312,2011-04-22 15:27:00,1590," i'm well aware that this is a discussion about the long gun registry, but your comment about handguns just makes me shake my head. you're supposedly a legal long gun owner, but you could care less about others losing their handguns. losing handguns IS the first step towards long gun confiscation. saying that we should ban handguns because we can't hunt with them is as stupid as saying you can't own a hammer if you're going to use it for anything but hitting a nail  apparently i have a much better grasp of the current firearms related issues in canada. maybe you should do some reading about licensed PAL/RPAL holders having their firearms confiscated simply because big brother changed the status of different firearms.  the fact that you referred to a firearms license as an FAC (it's been called a PAL since 1998) would suggest you aren't keeping up with current firearms issues. that's fine though...you can just sit back and keep voting lieberal while the rest of us legal firearms owners are fighting for our right to own firearms and to abolish the long gun registry so YOU can keep YOUR guns.  the long gun registries ONLY purpose is to give big brother a list to make confiscation that much easier. you gotta have a few loose screws if you believe that the only reason we've been fighting the long gun registry for so long is to save taxpayers some money..."
575216,bushart,2011-04-22 15:31:00,2628,Man your full of assumptions---If you read I said I 1st had an FAC and now I have a PAL  Been a legal gun owner for a very long time and do not need lessons from groups with agendas like yours
575360,pics,2011-04-22 23:51:00,1268,Agenda ? We want the right to use firearms as tools not as weapons...A semi auto seems like a tool of mass destruction to someone from the city who is not familiar with guns so it's an easy sell for prohibition....I won't buy a shot gun unless it's a pump for fear of confiscation if and when the Liberals take power. My hope is that the registry is dead before then and the records destroyed... Recently the Hamilton police were seizing guns that weren't registered even though there is supposed to be an amnesty...I was a holdout until they told me in the fall to register mine or else.....They are now registered.....

Even when you take the course they disable the gun for you to learn handling.  Thats the whole system...you gotta have a license...police check and references and all that...the registry is just so they know how many guns you have after you get the license

They have told me the registry does not help. The police chiefs supporting it are motivated by money and politics.  The registry isn't a joke, it's a scam on taxpayers and many are suckered in by the hype. Many gun owners did not trust the registry and have ""put some away"" unregistered. I did mine being a law abiding citizen but it pissed me off having to do so.  As someone has already mentioned, handguns have been registered for several decades but they continue to get into the hands of those that misuse them.  It hasn't been proven in any case that the registry has done any good at all. Incredible that the registry began and lasted this long."
574708,Fishnwire,2011-04-20 23:13:00,983," I'm not sure that last comment was necessary.  Maybe that kind of thing is ""precisely why"" a lot of non-owners have a problem with owners...they've been spoken to by them in such a manner too many times.   The Ã‰cole Polytechnique Massacre and the inception of the LGR were over a decade apart.  I don't ever remember proponents suggesting it could have prevented a madman with a semi-automatic from committing those heinous acts...instead it was opponents who were quick to point out that it wouldn't have.  No one suggested the LGR would eliminate all crime involving firearms, which is why I find it curious when people point out that it hasn't...like you just did.   The safe storage law COULD have lead to people turning in firearms they didn't want to store safely, but for the most part...it didn't.  That's evidenced by the thousands of weapons turned in leading up to and following the inception of the LGR.  Are you really trying to tell me that you believe all those guns would have been turned in without the registry looming at that time?   We teach our kids not to get into strangers cars, but we still hope the state does the best job it can of protecting them from pedophiles, right?  We teach them to look both ways before they cross the street, but we still expect the state to enforce traffic regulations, right?  Also, you're being a little unrealistic...do you believe that you can simply instruct the average 12 year old boy to not touch something that he thinks is really, really cool...and then be certain he won't have his hands all over it when no one is looking?  You never did anything your parents warned you not to when you were young I suppose?   What did I say that would indicate I didn't already know that, and am therefore in need of an ""education""?  There's a pretty good chance that handguns are used more than long guns in the commission of crimes because they are a better tool for the job.  What does that have to do with a system which gets unwanted guns out of circulation and ensures that those that are lawfully held are always traceable back to the owner?"
574973,Oggie,2011-04-21 20:07:00,588,Good thread! I'm one of those kids that did fire a gun at the age of 10 when I was supposed to be JUST babysitting. I had fired the gun before only with supervision. The SAFE STORAGE Law would have prevented a near tragedy. The registering of the gun would have made no difference.  I real don't like the LG registry because I worry about it's data base being secure. In the wrong hands it's now a detailed shopping list and lets face it any system can be hacked.  The Chiefs of Police have been TOLD to support the registry IMO by the politicians that control their budgets.  When they quote the number of times the Registry has been queried by police I understand that is misleading. Any time a police offer uses a computer to search a person's info the LG registry is just part of the protocols. Officers don't purposely use the system as often as it appears.  Dan O.

If you are in anyway representative of the average liberal voter I am proud to say im not one of you.  You don't care about the registry, you care that it might mean people don't vote for your precious liberals, some of us, who you know actually do some research, know something about the statistics, actually care about the principle.  There are a lot of people who voted NDP because they thought their mp was going to vote to scrap it, were they affected by the NDP mothership?  You know it's no wonder that it's impossible to have a reasoned discussion about this, you talk about conservative extremism, and yet are completely blind to how ridiculous you look when you write something like the above, part of the disdain i  have for the liberals stems from having to accept drivel as the above as someones valid opinion when frankly it's simple idiocy.  The real fear mongers in this election are the liberals, the same people who stand on the graves of victims and talk about the registries importance while knowing full well the only real effectiveness it has is convincing simple minded people that they really care, when all they really care about is your vote.

575197,ch312,2011-04-22 14:20:00,1590," :rolleyes:  let me get this straight. since we're not allowed to hunt with handguns in canada, you could care less if thousands of LEGAL gun owners had their handguns confiscated to be destroyed with ZERO compensation? the intended purpose of the firearms registry was to give the government a list of who owns what to make confiscation that much easier for them. you can't deny owning a gun if your names on ""the list"". banning handguns is the first step for the lieberals and their quest to take all of our guns away. if you support banning handguns, you're supporting complete firearms confiscation.  take a look at austrailia and how the registry resulted in the confiscation of semi auto long guns. the same type of firearm that thousands of hunters use in ontario every year.  any legal firearm owner that supports banning ANY firearm is an enemy to the rest of us legal firearms owners. you're either with us or against us. it's really that simple."

573643,blarg,2011-04-18 17:28:00,289,"  So because some people vote for parties that support the registry those parties won't ever ban handguns or semi autos's, or anything with a scope..they call those 'sniper guns', they have already proposed doing just that, both the liberals and the ndp.  The rcmp have already used the registry to confiscate guns that they deemed prohibited after they had been available for sale under the current rules.  But whatever believe what you like, some people are principled enough to want it gone, it still costs 20 something million a year to run (yes 20+, the 4million number is a fallacy, the rcmp have said so) and it doesn't prevent crime.  Do I like the fact that the conservatives are the only option, not really, but then should I vote for the NDP many of whom used the promise of voting to get rid of the registry to get elected and then flip flopped?  So is it a big deal right now, not at all, I'm all registered, but this is an issue of principle, it is a bad law, cost a lot, and targets the wrong people, we shouldn't just accept that.  Btw the elitist attitude on this board really shows up quick when something like this comes up, just remember, a lot of recreational fisherman are also hunters.  It's also funny how the ""liberals"" will bash conservatives and the conservative party every chance they get, with the usual, o they want the death penalty, they will ban abortion, they hate women, etc etc etc, meanwhile show one bill they passed that give any indications that the 'hidden agenda' really exists?  At the same time the liberals have passed bad laws like the registry, cut health care more than anyone, stole or lost billions, raided the ei fund for 50 billion, illegally, and it goes on and on.  Vote what you feel is best for you but honestly there is no need to bash someone elses choice, they all have blood on their hands."

Ya I see a thread about washing machines that better fits a fishing websites description. Lets not talk about politicians who are going to ban the weapons we already use to hunt with. It's a good topic that needs to never die. There are many other examples of government waste and stupid laws that need to be kept alive.

I could care less about who(or which party) is going to scrap it....but I have serious concerns about whom ever( or which party) supports it. My vote is not solidified but the issue is one that is very important to me.
574075,Fishnwire,2011-04-19 13:08:00,983,"I have to admit I haven't read all the comments.  Anyway... --- Have you ever noticed that every time there's a report in the news of an incident involving a handgun or automatic weapon, some opponent of the LGR points out how its existence did nothing to prevent the crime?  I always laugh because the LGR was never intended to do anything about such problems...nor was it ever sold as something that would.  It would be like me suggesting we should scrap speed limits on our roads because they've done nothing to limit drunk driving. - The LGR was intended to cut down on the amount of neglected, half-forgotten, and improperly secured long guns residing under camp beds, in unlocked sheds and in the backs of closets.  Firearms that may have been passed down to those uninterested in safely maintaining them, or those whose very ownership is unclear.  It encourages everyone who owns a registered long gun (which may have been unregistered prior to the LGR) to ensure they are vigilant in knowing its whereabouts and that it is safely secured at all times.  If the owner fails to do so and that failure contributes to an undesirable outcome, he or she knows that the recovered weapon can be traced right back to them, at which point they'll have some questions to answer about how that happened.  When the LGR was implemented thousands of weapons (tens of thousands?)were turned in by people who weren't prepared to take that responsibility.  That equals thousands of guns that your and my kids can't get a hold of because they're no longer wrapped up in a blanket in your neighbour's garage...or wherever. - Valid arguments can be made that the LGR is ""not necessary"".  I could make the argument that unloading your weapon, AND putting a trigger lock on it, AND storing the ammo in a separate location is not necessary...but all of you (most of you?)do it.  You employ redundant and arguably unnecessary safety measures regarding the storage, transport and use of your guns because you're responsible and want to prevent the possibility of any accident, no matter how unlikely.  I can't figure out why the LGR isn't viewed as a similar aspect of the hobby that takes time, money, and effort, but is simply part of the deal."
574097,chilli,2011-04-19 14:04:00,199,Now that was a reasonable argument. Thank you With that said if they could implement it without it costing millions of dollars a year it might be acceptable. That but of coarse they have to be able to keep the information out of the wrong hands.
574120,blarg,2011-04-19 15:37:00,289,"  And that folks is precisely why we have a registry, the country is full of people with an opinion and no knowledge.  The registry was touted as a crime prevention tool after the poly technique shooting, of course it didn't prevent the Dawson college shooting that was committed with a registered rifle, but hey, who's counting.  All of the other comments about storage and safety are taken care by a completely separate law, i say again, COMPLETELY SEPARATE. A law which no one, or very few, have a problem with, because that law actually does some good.  Also, the safe storage law would cover the rifle in a blanket issue, and also could have lead to people turning in firearms they didn't want to store safely.  Instead of depending upon the state to protect your children from their ignorance you could just teach them.  We have had a handgun registry since the 30's, hand guns are still used much more often than long guns in crimes, Despite hand guns being much much less common than long guns, yep, that's what the country needs, more useless liberal laws that pander to people who are more than happy to have an opinion without an education."

574160,Warthaug,2011-04-19 17:28:00,30,"But fishNwire's point was valid - we register all sorts of things in this country: motor vehicles, aircraft, some types of industrial equipment, etc.  These registries serve a variety of purposes, ranging from monitoring/controlling trade of the registered objects, to a mechanism of monitoring compliance with the law, to taxation, to tracking stolen equipement.  The hand gun registry serves the first two aims admirably, and at a relatively small cost.  I'd have no problem with the LGR if it had been implemented for those kinds of purposes, and implemented in a way that it could be effectively used for those purposes.  Unfortunately, it was sold as a crime-prevention tool, a purpose for which its utility is dubious at best.  Meaning we have a costly, poorly designed registry which serves no practical purpose and has few if any measurable benefits.  I also never understood why the existing (and functional) hand gun registry wasn't simply expanded to cover long guns; why re-invent the wheel and double up on bureaucracy and equipment?  Bryan"

I know that the local guy did not have a PAL and the way the guy from the south handled a gun I'm fairly certain he had never held one before. They both participated in the shoot...you know, just for fun. But both of them were totally breaking the law by even picking up a gun....and they didn't even know it.  As far as the registry...its junk to me. My daughter in another town has a PAL and can borrow my registered guns any time she wants and keep them at her place forever as long as they are registered to me. How does that help any cop that gets called to her place...Nope...no guns registered there...lets go in guys.   And then Tony Martin our MP says. I know my constituents don't want the gun registry but the Chiefs of Police ASSOCIATION..you know, their club, likes it so I will vote for it...I know better than the children that voted for me"
573534,dannyboy,2011-04-18 12:34:00,367,"Here is a link to a CBC poll about scrapping the long gun registry, although not official politicians may pay attention. I feel the registry has been a huge waste of resources pandering to the vocal bleeding heart minority. It has had no real effect on the crime rate other than making criminals safer. 'If you have nothing to hide, then you have nothing to fear...Except being oppressed for no good reason.'  Dan"
573537,bushart,2011-04-18 12:45:00,2628,This political message sanctioned by OFC??  Tell ya what now that registry is all said and done----I've been a hunter for 35 years and yeah it was a pain on implementation---now it don't bother me at all--I can still do things the way I always have  Leave the  fear mongering to the conservative leader
573546,Tootsie II,2011-04-18 12:54:00,162,"As a long gun owner I agree that the whole thing was a waste of time and money. The problem is that as 80% of Canadian citizens now live in larger urban environments and many of us who grew up using guns as a tool to put food on the table and well as for recreational hunting are getting a little long in the tooth, today's urban dwellers see guns as a threat to public safety and not as a tool. As well, regretably, in those cities, it is also seen as a womens' safety issue. If any political party wants to get rid of the registry, they should keep quiet about it til they get a majority and then do the deed. As long as we keep harping about it and keep the registry in the minds of urban dwellers and particularly a majority of urban women, we will be stuck with it. Sorry if that appears as an ""us against them, urban vs rural issue"" and a rather sexist point of view, but IMHO, that's the way it is."
573547,bushart,2011-04-18 12:56:00,2628,What CAN'T you do today with a rifle you could'nt do pre-registry?
573551,Old Man,2011-04-18 13:06:00,822, We can actually do more now. We can waste taxpayers money.
573552,bushart,2011-04-18 13:09:00,2628,You bet leaving more disposable billions for G8 bathroom breaks in Huntsville  That Dollar argument sailed with last years g8-g20  mmmm lets see----I can spend a billion on a weekend photo shoot  Or I can spend a billion to try and make the cops jobs easier  Lets see---ya your right
573554,Old Man,2011-04-18 13:14:00,822,"  I have 4 police officers in my family. Not one of them have ever used the Long Gun Registry. When responding to any domestic call, they always assume and are prepared for the presence of a weapon. To stake one's life strictly on the accuracy of the registry information would be fool hardy."
573555,Roy,2011-04-18 13:16:00,13728,This one will not last long.
573556,Pikeslayer,2011-04-18 13:21:00,1443,  Amen to that Roy .  Slayer
573558,Tootsie II,2011-04-18 13:35:00,162,"Really folks, the gun registry was a huge waste by one party, the G-8 & G-20 was way overspent by another, shouldn't we give the other guys a chance to try their hand at wasting our cash? LOL"
573563,Joey,2011-04-18 13:59:00,9122, I knew that as soon as I saw the title.
573564,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2011-04-18 14:10:00,0,I agree that both the registry and the g20 summit were wastes of money.  So WHY are we bickering about it on a fishing board instead of letting our politicians know how we feel?
573566,dannyboy,2011-04-18 14:27:00,367,There is no reason we can't have an intelligent discourse without needing Mods to intervene or adding comments that have no bearing.  Don't take it personally because someone doesn't agree with you - no persons ego should be that fragile.  Dan
573567,torco,2011-04-18 14:31:00,656,Enough has been said on the long gun registery from both sides.  This is a perfect issue for politicians as its devisive and really not major in the grand scheme of things.  I say lets get back to major issues and the house can debate the registry at some point again in the future.
573568,lookinforwalleye,2011-04-18 14:33:00,4399,"Vote NDP that will fix everything, I remember Bob Rae!!!  If we could just convince the criminals to register their guns everything would be cool!!!  Harper already said he will eliminate the LG registry with a majority!"
573574,POLLIWOGG,2011-04-18 14:52:00,835,"The main purpose for the gun registry at this point is all about votes and nothing to do with guns. No one is going to get rid of the golden goose.    As for spending, The fastest way to smaller government no matter who gets elected is to spend all the money."

573578,limeyangler,2011-04-18 15:28:00,5204,"I live in the NW ontario and i hear a lot about the long gun registry. I dont hunt and have little clue to what the fuss is about.  I did find this interesting....this is a local news report about an all candidate debate that happened recently     All Candidates Forum in Dryden Draws Big Crowd Posted by BGW on Friday, April 15th, 2011 am 10:36:17 AM   It got a little testy at times during last night's All-Candidates forum for the Federal Candidates in the Kenora Riding.  It was a packed house at the Dryden Legion.  The highlight of the evening for some came when a member of the audience related how her husband had been charged and convicted on a firearms offense, said she knew all about the long gun registry but surely it wasn't the only issue facing voters. She challenged each candidate to describe the single most important issue in the riding without mentioning the gun registry. Her question drew a resounding ovation from the audience."
573579,Terry,2011-04-18 15:28:00,14456, the Long gun registry  is/was a complete waste of time and money  it will never stop a crime and doesn't make anyone safer  scrap it scrap it scrap it...gov. seemed to think criminals would register all their guns....yeah  it makes honest people criminals
573583,Bernie,2011-04-18 15:42:00,3190,"Not only is it a waste of taxpayers dollars. My concern is this is the first step towards the taking away of repeating firearms. Hunting is a way of life for many folks that live away from urban centers. Time to get rid of it. For those that say it isn't important to them, it's actually the most important thing in this election to many."
573596,archie_james_c,2011-04-18 15:57:00,618,Registration is the first step to confiscation. You can call me a right wing tin foil hat wearing conspiracy theorist all you want. But I know darn well the liberals stance on guns and hunting. In the long run they want it all GONE. its not just our auto loaders they want it's EVERYTHING.
573610,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2011-04-18 16:26:00,0," You need to look no further than your own riding to know that's false.  The sault is NDP, algoma manitoulin is liberal... voted in by the citizens... MANY of whom are hunters...  Surely the majority of the people in the Soo have at least a family member who hunts, if not themselves!  The Long Gun Registry is bogus, but it's a MINOR issue compared to the problems that we face as a country.  But tinfoil hat wearing types like yourself love to drum up fear that the man is going to come and take your guns away and try to make the gun registry seem like a bigger issue to most canadians than it is.  I'm not going to take your guns, but us ""liberals"" also aren't going to let you try to scare people into voting conservative.  Where would the right wing be without it's fear campaigns."
573612,dannyboy,2011-04-18 16:32:00,367,I feel the reaction that it changes nothing and doesn't effect honest people is denial.  The same people will be after your fishing rods after they get your guns.  Check out the poems: First They came by Martin Niemoller and The Hangman by Maurice Ogden; it is the proven tactic of divide and conquer.  Dan
573634,torco,2011-04-18 17:12:00,656,"  Kudos to the Dr.  This idea of big brother taking your guns and your fishing rods reminds me of the simpson when homer gets a gun direct quote.  ""Lisa: The second amendment is just a remnant from revolutionary periods, it has no real meaning today  Homer: You couldn't be more wrong Lisa. If I didn't have this gun the King of England could just come in here and start pushing you around. Do you want that, well do ya?""  The registry is a minor issue...lets focus on more important things in the federal election."
