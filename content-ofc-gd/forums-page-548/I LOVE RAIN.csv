575637,jubaitca,2011-04-24 00:04:00,12, Went to oshawa in the evening and there was no one in sight pretty much all along the creek...kinda surprised.

576086,torco,2011-04-25 14:45:00,656,"I was out your way COPPER fishing with a buddy of mine, we were mostly targeting browns and we noticed the samething not a lot of people out until the rain slowed. Of course I did notice on the Friday night a popular place in oshawa had multiple tents pitched. I will never understand these people that stand shoulder to shoulder in what can't be more than 20 by 10 foot pool."
576124,asdve23rveavwa,2011-04-25 16:35:00,2690,"  The main reason I stay far away from any of the tribs on opener.  Was much more enjoyable for me to be on an inland lake with plenty of elbow room and peace. That, said...sounds like you had a great opener anyways Copper!!  Good news on the pre-opening bust as well!"
576132,craigdritchie,2011-04-25 17:17:00,1586,"If you really do love rain, then you're in for a spectacular week!"
