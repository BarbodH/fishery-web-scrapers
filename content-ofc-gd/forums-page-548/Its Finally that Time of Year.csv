575174,Roy,2011-04-22 12:41:00,13728,"Go get'em, Mike! WOOHOOOOOOO! Looking for lakers or wawas?"
575176,Mike the Pike,2011-04-22 12:51:00,3421,Well last year I got my PB Laker 6 lbs but honestly I have 2 young lads coming with me my son Ryan 12 and a Shayne 14.  I want to see those boys get into some fish.  What I have learned since trout opener in Magog.Don't show up the first 2 days but go fishing on Sunday and boat traffic is no more.Last year on the Sunday there was only about 15 boats.So no more fishing in the ZOO.
575177,Roy,2011-04-22 12:57:00,13728," Mike, you can also drop down two lakes....no traffic at all...no wind because of the mountains and good quantity of lakers. I'm pretty sure you know which one I mean."
