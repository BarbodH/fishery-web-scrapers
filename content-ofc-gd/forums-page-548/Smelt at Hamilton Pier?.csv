575157,pikehunter,2011-04-22 11:11:00,1659,"I think it has been closed since last year, at least since last autumn. Good idea posting so as no one wastes their time by going down there to fish. I do think that the Burlington side (pier) of the canal is open but have never seen anyone fishing that side."
575195,Live2fish85,2011-04-22 14:15:00,1633,I see the odd person out there fishing on Burlington side but not to many at least 1 or 2 a day on the pier.
575282,express168,2011-04-22 19:41:00,327,"Hamilton pier has been closed down since the summer, the Burlington side is open. They will be working on the pier a little longer still as they will be doing some more restoration to the Hamilton Harbour end of it. We have supplied some of the materials for the job and the pier was in desperate need of restoration."
