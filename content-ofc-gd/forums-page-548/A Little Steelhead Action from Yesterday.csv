We started out running bottom bouncers with pink and chartreuse bags. Second cast of the day and Paul's on steel...  http://i982.photobucket.com/albums/ae310/archie_james_c/003-3.jpg  Immediately afterwards he hooks into a nice chunky Brook Trout! (sorry no pic)  He caught another chromer there and off we moved to the next spot.  Spot number 2 yielded 2 steelies for Paul and 1 for me. We each kept one male for the table and that was that.  Up until now we were bouncing spawn, but we reached a little snag ridden trough that HAD to be floated...paul being such a stubborn old timer refused to float, so he kept the boat steady in the current for me to hook up (and lose) 2. Paul couldnt resist and tied a float on and caught and landed a nice male...put him back in the drink and we were off to the final spot of the day, one he was sure was going to hold some good numbers of steel.  We had to bush wack a bit to get to the pools...I tried making my own trail, and found a nice little hidden cave...  http://i982.photobucket.com/albums/ae310/archie_james_c/006.jpg  We got to the pools finally, I went 5 for 3 in about 30 minutes, we decided we had about a 45 minute ride back to the dock, plus loading the gear and heading back to town so we took off....overall a hell of an afternoon  http://tinypic.com/r/16humbc/7  http://i982.photobucket.com/albums/ae310/archie_james_c/010.jpg  http://i982.photobucket.com/albums/ae310/archie_james_c/013.jpg  http://i982.photobucket.com/albums/ae310/archie_james_c/014-1.jpg"
