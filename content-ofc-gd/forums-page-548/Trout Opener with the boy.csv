575484,danbouck,2011-04-23 15:03:00,4380,"I started out the trout opener by my oldest waking me up to go fishing   We headed out around 8:30 to a spot 5 minutes from the house. I never really have any luck there for trout but today turned out to be a great day.  First spot I had a couple hits but nothing landed so we decided to try out our WGSF spot and ended up catching 16 between the 2 of us in the the hour. I love the colors on these little Browns, just wish I brought the good camera with us but the Blackberry does the job.              Off to Long Point for some perch with Jacob tomorrow!"
