Pikeslayer(Simon), Pikeslayer jr(Sean) and his friend(Jordan) arrived at 11:00. We started on the dock and about 2 1/2 hours later we were done and having a good lunch made by Cliff's wife Sue and Simon's wife Mary. I don't know what she calls those tasty things she made but they were ham.green onion,light cream cheese in a wrap!! Damn they were good!!!!!!!!!!  :thumbsup_anim:  Daniel was in charge of picture taking, in between helping us with the dock. Here's the pictures he took, Simon has a few he can add too.  Simon fixing the dock   Sean fixing another piece of dock along with Cliff   The first section.   Waiting for the next section.   Checking to make sure the boat had clearance from the dock.   The final piece was in and we are off to get lunch.   Many hands make for light work. It was a good fun day, had by all. With the exemption of Jordan who was jumping in the water with his bathing suit on to help me level the section, every time he jumped in as a man, when he got out he was almost a woman....LOL  Daniel sends a big thank you to you Cliff for the engines."

Last dock party at Cliff's, Jack and I couldn't do much about the docks but we managed to burn some pretty swell burgers... Damn I miss him...     "
