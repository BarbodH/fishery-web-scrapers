To early?  i havent even spotted one.  Water was high and muddy yesterday. Today it dropped a fair bit and cleared up quite nice i managed one brookie all weekend.
575828,BillM,2011-04-24 18:39:00,17367,No point in fishing that river when it's blown out.  In the spring time it's always a gamble.  In the fall however I'm on it a few times a week at least..
575829,Freshtrax,2011-04-24 18:42:00,2215,yea i diddnt touch the main river.  have the fish come and gone? or am i early. i live in hamlton now so i cant keep my eve on it> i have a feeling next weekend will be better
575837,misfish,2011-04-24 19:17:00,29133,I was lucky enough to get one this spring my first time out.Been out once after that. The notty has been high all spring. Hope to get out during the week. I have a turkey to take down first.
575920,BillM,2011-04-25 00:36:00,17367," You definitely aren't early.  Looks like opener might have come a wee bit late this year, lol.  Although really you can't complain when the fish do their thing and get back to the lake before people have a chance to target them.  Think about the returns we'll see in 2-3 years because of it..  No complaints from me."
