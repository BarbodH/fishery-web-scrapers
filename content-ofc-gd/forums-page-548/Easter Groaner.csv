575993,irishfield,2011-04-25 03:17:00,26272,"Happy Easter  A man is driving along a highway and sees a rabbit jump out across the middle of the road.  He swerves to avoid hitting it, but unfortunately the rabbit jumps right in front of the car.  The driver, a sensitive man as well as an animal lover, pulls over and gets out to see what has become of the rabbit.   Much to his dismay, the rabbit is the Easter Bunny, and he is  DEAD.  The driver feels so awful  that he begins to cry.  A beautiful blonde woman driving down the highway sees a man crying on the side of the road and pulls over.  She steps out of the car and asks the man what's wrong.  ""I feel terrible,""! he explains, “I accidentally hit the Easter Bunny with my car and KILLED HIM.""  The blonde says, ""Don't worry.""        She runs to her car and pulls out a spray can.  She walks over to the limp, dead  Easter Bunny , bends down, and sprays the contents onto him.  The  Easter Bunny  jumps up, waves its paw at the two of them  and hops off down the road.  Ten feet away he stops,  turns around and waves again, he hops down the road another 10 feet,  turns and waves, hops another ten feet, turns and waves, and  repeats this again and again and again and again, until he hops out of sight.  The man is astonished. He runs over to the woman and demands,   ""What is in that can?   What did you spray on the Easter Bunny ?""  The woman turns the can around so that the man can read the label.  (Are you ready for this?)  (OK, here it is)  It says, ""Hair Spray Restores life to dead hair,  and adds permanent wave."""
