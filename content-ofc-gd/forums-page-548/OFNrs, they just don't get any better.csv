Skeeter and his son showed up, Pikeslayer his beautiful wife, and son showed up and brought Jorden (one of Sean's college friends) along as well. It took us 3 hours but the docks are repaired and in. I could never have done it without them.  Thank you each and every one of you for all your hard work and wonderful company!"
