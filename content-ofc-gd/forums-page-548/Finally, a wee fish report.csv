There were also a number of willing victims. Mostly mudcats.   And the fish retriever with a sucker.  Must admit I was quite surprised by the number of fish caught. Water was as thick as a chocolate milkshake."

Again great job on those victims and thanks for sharing Jacques"

Ugly little bugger but they were always willing to bite.... Especially after dark!  Good job man!!!  Cheers, Ryan"
