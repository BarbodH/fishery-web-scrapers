552783,Leecher,2011-02-18 00:13:00,7832,Congrats on the new wheels Nice choice
552791,Terry,2011-02-18 00:24:00,14456," they only made them in 05, 06 and that is a 08..do the math..LOL"
552896,skeeter,2011-02-18 04:23:00,1907,check and make sure it has a trailer hitch! and check the wiring harness with a test light.
552916,outllaw,2011-02-18 10:43:00,1232,I also drive one. Its never been back for any warranty defects.. the 4wheel is awesome.
552920,ketchenany,2011-02-18 11:44:00,3229,"Jeep can't go wrong. I have a 95 grand c parked with 370,000 and running and a 2007 Compass great cars."
552956,lookinforwalleye,2011-02-18 13:59:00,4399,"Ya I hope it works out the reviews seemed mostly positive, got what I believe is a good deal 17k out the door and that includes a brand new set of winter tires on rims and a 3 year gold plan warranty that covers the vehicle from bumper to bumper. There is no hitch on it now but according to dealer it`s a simple and relatively inexpensive add-on,perhaps we`ll get a lift kit put on and some Mickey Thompson`s and go crush some CRV`s and some RAV 4's  Just kidding"
553014,GBW,2011-02-18 16:14:00,8460,I would make sure that you have a heavy duty transmission cooler installed too.  There is more to a tow package then a hitch and wires.  Have a look here Tow info
553221,Rattletrap2,2011-02-19 01:22:00,1652,"Congrats Gord! Looks like a beauty......and oh, I'll have to hide  my Rav 4 when I see you coming up the highway! LOL"
553240,lookinforwalleye,2011-02-19 02:59:00,4399,"  LOL no worries Brian I love Toyota`s and Honda`s, Toyota and Honda are good customers of mine I did the racking and shelving in the central stores in Alliston and Woodstock!"
