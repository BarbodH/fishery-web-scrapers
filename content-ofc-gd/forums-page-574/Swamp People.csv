552361,mercman,2011-02-17 02:03:00,7054,yeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee hawwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwww  Ti-Mike is still trying to impress his pappy
552368,Kingsalmon,2011-02-17 02:18:00,107,"I hope Troy is back in this episode.   Shoot'em, Shoot'em!!"
552372,mercman,2011-02-17 02:34:00,7054,Oh boys....its a tree shaker
552546,acrimi,2011-02-17 15:28:00,18,"love this show, waiting for one of the boys to be eaten by a gator.  almost the same IQ!!!"
552557,bigugli,2011-02-17 15:52:00,6138,"Be nice. Some days every son thinks he knows better than his father, and some days most fathers think their sons is that stoopid. Starts around age 13 and lasts anywhere from 25-30 before son realizes pops was usually right, and pops realizes he was being an hard   at times. All part of the process."
552566,perchslayer666,2011-02-17 16:08:00,280,I feel like I haven't had a shower in weeks after watching this show. Lost my interest after the first few episodes.  River Monsters is a much better show.
552580,Dutchy,2011-02-17 16:43:00,416," Nah, the gators ain't that dumb.    What an absolutely awful program IMO. I watched it last night for the first time. Is this really what we consider entertainment nowadays. Really?  :blink:"
552592,Billy Bob,2011-02-17 17:43:00,5865, I think so......it shows how other people live and earn a living while trying to pass down a way of life to their children. I don't see anything wrong with that. When you get older you will understand.
552619,mercman,2011-02-17 18:59:00,7054, BOB  Its back to basics living. Troys son shows a wonderful respect and love for his dad that you dont see often in this fast paced world.It warms my heart to see that father and son bond.One that i miss daily.
552631,Dutchy,2011-02-17 19:40:00,416, I never said there was anything wrong with what they were doing. I said it is awful entertainment. Maybe you'll understand when you get older.
552637,mercman,2011-02-17 19:58:00,7054,
552741,Billy Bob,2011-02-17 23:00:00,5865," I never said you said ""there was anything wrong with what they were doing""....you asked  ""Is this really what we consider entertainment nowadays. Really""  So I complied with my post....next time if you don't want someone to respond don't ask the question. I'm older enough to know that..."

552766,Muskieman,2011-02-17 23:41:00,2472,Laissez les bon temps rouler!!!
552768,skeeter,2011-02-17 23:43:00,1907,Ya what he said ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
552820,Muskieman,2011-02-18 01:10:00,2472,"If the producers of this show decided to make a show about a ""Trapper Family"" from Northern Ontario... it probably wouldn't be that different.  Instead of shootin' gators they'd be Bonking Lynx and Wabbit... skinning Beaver and Muskrat..bombing down a trail on an old Ski-Doo.. eating beans and playing the harmonica.  To me it's a window to a different culture and lifestyle.. and I like the Cajun-French accent.  Welcome to da Swamp, Laissez les bon temps rouler!!"
552824,mercman,2011-02-18 01:27:00,7054,  sure beats the crap out of american idol and Jeopardy.Reality shows are just that R E A L I T Y. Real people living real life situations. What do you call entertainment
552917,Billy Bob,2011-02-18 10:53:00,5865," I agree....I never could understand why everyone likes these FAKE Reality productions....but whatever floats your boat.  Randy has a great idea......""TRAPPER MAN""......  BTW is this the first time Swamp People is being run in Canada because these are all reruns down here and they are on the History Channel at 9pm not 10pm as reported in this thread."
552921,mercman,2011-02-18 11:49:00,7054, did you forget to put your clocks back last fall Bob
552928,Billy Bob,2011-02-18 12:11:00,5865,It's SPRING TIME down here so they are already moved ahead...
