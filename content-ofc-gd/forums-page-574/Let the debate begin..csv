552938,splashhopper,2011-02-18 12:39:00,2931,"  I think this is closer to the real deal than anything.  My daughter was the 2008,2009,2010 Canadian NATIONAL Taekwondo champ for her age and weight categories. ( She placed silver this year)  At the regional tournaments she has attended since 5 years old, she would initially fight boys and girls. AS she got older, the only matches she had against boys were bonus matches (basically for her to fight tougher competitors).  When she turned 11 years old, no boys would fight her anymore and it has been strongly suggested by competing clubs that this is due the above quoted statement.  Do I like seeing my daughter kick the crap out of some boy... damned right I do.  But would I like to see a stronger boy kick the crap out of my girl.... I ""may"" be able to handle one fight with these results, but if it was obvious that this was going to be a repeating pattern due to physical strength only, I would discuss this with her coach and trust that he would have my daughters best HEALTH consideration in mind first and foremost.  Bottom line, she is well trained, well conditioned, and fights in age,weight and height categories relevant to her sport.  She loves watching the older girls kick the hell out of each other.  This is a real wait and see situation with us as I type this.  Stay tuned.  Splashopper and Botbot ( pronounced like the word good good)"

I can honestly say (and I was a competetive high-school wrestler) I have only done it once ... it was about 30 years ago .. and I would never do it again ... I met ""Wanda"", who was on the US womens (mud) wrestling team in a 'classy' bar in Fort Lauderdale ...I think ""Playpen"" was in the name somewhere... anyway after a couple of hours of chatting and drinking she said she had to go to ""work"" ... how would I like to wrestle her and by the way there was a $100 prize to any guy who could 'pin her'... it was the main event for the evening's entertainment ...  as a guy who at that time was in pretty good shape,  I was put  up against two women (each of whom were no more than 105 ponds soaking wet with their bikinis on)... well ... I have never been so badly beaten up in my life ... ever ... and yes there WAS biting and scratching and kicking and (groan) stuff that just aint right... but apparantly from the chearing and screaming 'KILL HIM' , 'KICK HIM IN THE NUTS AGAIN !!!'.... there was flying scissor locks and 'gotchy-pulls' ... anyhow apparantly it was great entertainment for the crowd ... I hung in there and lost as gracefully as I could... and while we all showered together and I thought I had 'earned' my graces with her .. I realized how dumb the whole thing really was when she whispered in my ear ... ""you are just lucky we didnt rip your  balls off !"" ...  Moral of the story .... don't fight wimmens ...ever ... even if they invite you nicely and promise you great things ... DON'T DO IT.. nothing good will ever come from it"

Made the team fair and square...she's that good...but, did she ever have to grow a thick skin.  She's heard many things from opposing players, anywhere from ""that's why girls shouldn't play on a boy's team"" when she missed a free throw, to comments that I can't repeat on here. As far as wrestling, I say keep the two sexes separate.  Team sports, such as volleyball, basketball, soccer, to name a few...if the girls can compete, let them play."

552704,HTHM,2011-02-17 22:03:00,4082,"DES MOINES, Iowa - An Iowa high school wrestler who was one of the favourites to win his weight class defaulted on his first-round state tournament match rather than face one of the first girls to ever qualify for the event.  Joel Northrup, a home-schooled sophomore who was 35-4 wrestling for Linn-Mar High this season, said in a statement that he doesn't feel it would be right for him to wrestle Cedar Falls freshman Cassy Herkelman. Herkelman, who was 20-13 entering the tournament, and fellow 112-pounder Ottumwa sophomore Megan Black, who was 25-13, made history by being the first girls to qualify for the state tournament. Black was pinned quickly in her opening round match.  ""I have a tremendous amount of respect for Cassy and Megan and their accomplishments. However, wrestling is a combat sport and it can get violent at times,"" wrote Northrup. ""As a matter of conscience and my faith I do not believe that it is appropriate for a boy to engage a girl in this manner. It is unfortunate that I have been placed in a situation not seen in most other high school sports in Iowa.""  There were several thousand fans on hand Thursday at Wells Fargo Arena, but many were watching other matches when the referee raised Herkelman's hand to signal her win. There was a smattering of cheers and boos from the crowd before Herkelman and Northrup were whisked into the bowels of the arena.  Tournament organizers declined to make Herkelman available for questions. Her next match is Friday.  In a text message to The Associated Press, her father, Bill Herkelman, said he understands Northrup's decision.  ""It's nice to get the first win and have her be on the way to the medal round,"" Bill Herkelman wrote. ""I sincerely respect the decision of the Northrup family especially since it was made on the biggest stage in wrestling. I have heard nothing but good things about the Northrup family and hope Joel does very well the remainder of the tourney.""  Linn-Mar athletics director Scott Mahmens said the school would not penalize Northrup for defaulting. Because he defaulted and didn't forfeit, Northrup is eligible to compete in consolation rounds. Black will also compete in the consolation rounds.  Wrestling is hugely popular in Iowa, and this is the first time girls have qualified for the state tournament, which began in 1926.  According to the National Federation of State High School Associations, just more than 6,000 girls competed in wrestling in 2009-10 — compared with nearly 275,000 boys. Though most states require girls to wrestle boys, California, Hawaii and Texas now sponsor girls-only high school wrestling tournaments."
552707,stubbex1,2011-02-17 22:09:00,164,"I have nothing against girls' wrestling, although i don't think I could ever wrestle a girl.  It just wouldn't feel right."
552712,NAW,2011-02-17 22:15:00,4022,"I've been involved in martial arts for 20 years.  I've fought many girls in sparing and grappling matches.  I would have no issues wrestling a girl.  I wouldn't back down one bit.  The guy stated faith had something to do with his decision. I can understand that I guess?  You can’t really hold anything against this guy, it’s just not the decision I would have made."

552724,Old Man,2011-02-17 22:42:00,822,"As father to three girls and grandfather to three grand daughters, I have very mixed feelings about this. I'd like to think my daughters and grand daughters should and will have all the opportunities to pursue anything they what to try or achieve, but there is an old world value that I still have that thinks that females should be protected from violence and held in higher place then men in that concern. At what point does our society decide that there should be no differences between the sexes? Where's the line?  This should be interesting to see the different responses."
552725,crappieperchhunter,2011-02-17 22:42:00,2582,"I think girls should be in girls sports and boys in boys. I personally don't think it should ever be mixed.  I don't care what the sport is just don't mix it up. Not trying to offend anyone...that is just my honest opinion.  When my son was young there was a 3 year span where he had girls on his hockey team. At that age it didn't matter. One year it was twin sister's. One was our goalie and the other a defenceman. Both where good players and good kids. But 3 years later the worst player on my sons team would make either of them look stupid. Once the boys started to mature they where just too fast and strong.  My niece played girls hockey at the highest level. Her team even got to play against the Chinese or Japanese Olympic team in a tune up game when they where here for the Vancouver Olympics. She would have probably been on the next Olympic team if she had stuck with it...she was that good. But I can honestly say from watching her play Midget hockey that a good boys Bantam house league team would have killed them every game no matter how many games they went head to head...the difference was that great.  In other sports there might not be as much of a difference say in pool or darts...but in physical sports I think nothing is gained by combining boys and girls.  My High School CWDHS had an awesome wrestling team. We had a girl back then who entered a tournament and a friend of mine on the team drew ""short straw"" and had to wrestle her. It was awkward and he absolutely hated it. He was not one of our better wrestler's and he dispatched her in no time. I could never ever figure out why these things happen.  Both my kids had equal opportunity to play sports. But no way in hell my daughter would ever play on a boys team and visa versa, that's just the way Debbe and I both felt."
552726,smally21,2011-02-17 22:43:00,993,"however you feel it seems like all parties involved handled their objections with class, or at least are well versed in TSN style interview speak.  personally, they should have both girls and boys classes. in many cases it seems the girls are req'd to join the boys teams for lack of competition or opportunity. girls played boys hockey in our town because there wasn't enough players for an all girls league.  i wouldn't want to wrestle a girl either. (unless it was after a few drinks and dinner). tough to explain to the wrestling team your second place ribbon in those circumstances.  at least no one acted like buffoons and started WW3 over it."

552736,Teressa,2011-02-17 22:50:00,55,"The girl chose to participate in the matches knowing she would have to wrestle boys. She must have been proud of herself for earning that right. I would be.  I enjoy wrestling with my boyfriend and take great pleasure in making him beg for mercy, but if I were to even suspect that he was throwing it because I am a girl, well I would be offended...it wouldn't be any more fun so why bother?  This is my personal opinion. I dont have an opinion on the boys decision, that was his own to make.  There is a difference between hitting out of anger and competing in a sport."
