552888,irishfield,2011-02-18 04:16:00,26272,Passport or the new enhansed licence. If you are flying.. you need a passport period! (to get into the USA)
552889,BillM,2011-02-18 04:17:00,17367,"I haven't seen an enhanced license, so you better have a passport to cross the border."

552993,splashhopper,2011-02-18 15:23:00,2931,"Passport. Took me 15 days to get mine. One of the simplest processes I have ever had with a government agency. Now getting my ""friends"" to vouch for me was a whole other experience! Lol"
552999,ranksda58,2011-02-18 15:36:00,69,"yep, you need a passport or an enhanced drivers license like splashhopper, got mine in about 2 weeks"
553137,Canuck2fan,2011-02-18 22:13:00,1444,I got mine in 9 days... It was very easy.
553161,BUSTER,2011-02-18 23:21:00,1336,Bingo
553216,spinnerbaitking,2011-02-19 01:15:00,1622," Easier to get a Passport than the Enhanced Drivers License & a lot less time too, when I got my 1 1/2 yrs ago I had 2 months to get it & was told I wouldn't have the licence in that amount of time & you have to go for an interview SBK"
