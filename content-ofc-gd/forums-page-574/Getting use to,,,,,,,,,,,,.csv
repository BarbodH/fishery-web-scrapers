552454,lew,2011-02-17 10:40:00,12766,"Mornin boyz, spring is in the air and I've been putzing around the house since 2:00.  It's a bit early for the deer yet Mike but perhaps it's time I went and got them up"
552456,Grimace,2011-02-17 10:46:00,2020,"Work has institutionalized me into waking up this early, even on the weekends when I do not have to.  December 30th 2041.  I retire.  It falls on a monday.  Aloha."
