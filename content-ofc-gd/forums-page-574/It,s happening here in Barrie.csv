Can't bring Jen home 'till late tomorrow night and then it's a good week + that we have to keep her away from the general population.  Have fun.. buy lots of stuff!! Jen... and all her fellow ""Crohnies""... appreciate any and all effort!"

552761,misfish,2011-02-17 23:31:00,29133,TY Roy for that. She does a great job.
552769,irishfield,2011-02-17 23:44:00,26272,"Thanks Bud!  She left the President a little bewildered at the meeting last Thur night... when he wanted to end the meeting with ""well everything should go just like last year.. everyone has it down pat"". Leah said ""you might wanna rethink that as I will not and have not spent the last 4 months canvasing/collection items for the silent auction as I've been a tad busy"". Hoping someone stepped up to the plate and filled the gap."

Some great entertainment... well priced booze and some door prized and silent auction items to buy. Last year I picked up a real #27 Leaf's jersey, with documentation, signed by Tucker and Corson.... donated by Corson's mother June."
