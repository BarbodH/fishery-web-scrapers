552170,Joey,2011-02-16 17:41:00,9122,Story from the newspaper today  Mantracker Story
552178,Muskieman,2011-02-16 18:10:00,2472,I applied for that show... If I get chosen to be tracked ... Damn Them!!! no Terry no deal.
552179,Spiel,2011-02-16 18:12:00,9065,Can't stand the man or the show.
552180,ranksda58,2011-02-16 18:14:00,69,"well, one less show to remember to watch...."
552192,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2011-02-16 18:43:00,0,Pretty crazy.  Terry Grant IS mantracker! And Phil Lemieux is the ultimate sidekick. Can anybody find the facebook group in support of bringing him back?  I can't find it...
552197,cityfisher,2011-02-16 18:57:00,959,show sucks....seems so fake... hope they cancel it
552203,Harrison,2011-02-16 19:07:00,2202,"I saw it once.  Kind of lost the ""realism"" when you have a camera crew filming you hiding.  I dunno, seemed to fake for me.  Like the concept though."
552207,mercman,2011-02-16 19:13:00,7054,I will be in mourning for months.I may not recover either.
552208,Muskieman,2011-02-16 19:18:00,2472,"I made application for this show and a buddy of mine, Ian ,beat the Man.  Here's how it went... the ""prey cam"" and Mantracker scenes are actual videos taken during the chase. The cameraman in the bush scenes are re-enactments shot after the race was ran..  Totally real and Canadian."
552211,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2011-02-16 19:28:00,0,"the camera man that stays with the prey is from sault ste. marie and i assure you that he is in no way encumbering or fake.  lawrence foster has climbed everest, participated in countless grueling eco-challenge races and other stamina based races, and is in as good of physical condition as any olympic athlete.  there is nothing fake about this guy and i've looked up to him since i was a kid."
552217,johnnyb,2011-02-16 19:51:00,3413,"Too bad they're losing Terry....but if they had enough talent and wisdom to find him....perhaps they can find someone else who will make the show just as good,,,or dare I say it....better?!?!?"
552236,jediangler,2011-02-16 20:50:00,1923,My 10yr old daughter is appalled that Mr. Grant is finished as Mantracker. As a Pheonix Coyotes fan she's excited to see the new season premier with Captain Shane Doan as the prey. I wonder who they will pair him with? Can't see it being as good with anyone else doing the hunting.
552350,Rod Caster,2011-02-17 00:55:00,5784,"My first cousin was on Mantracker...he was the other half of the ""frisbee"" duo. hahah good episode.  Too bad about Terry...it won't be the same (or existant for very long) without him."
552353,Rizzo,2011-02-17 01:27:00,4754,"one guy I know beat him, one guy I know lost...sounds like there will be no rubber match"
552444,Jonny,2011-02-17 05:12:00,1380,"I've watched quite a few episodes of Mantracker and enjoyed them.  I think the show is dead without Terry Grant. He brought the concept alive; without him the concept is worthless, now that people have learned to associate him with the show.  Too bad it wasn't a longer run."
552447,blue pickeral,2011-02-17 08:32:00,267,"C'mon folks think like producers....there are other qualified 'trackers' out there....get one or two new ones on for a season or two, kiss/makeup/bring back Terry....have trackers trying to outwit each other.....  The old format was getting boring..."
552548,Jonny,2011-02-17 15:30:00,1380," You could be right. But on the other hand, now that Grant is the image of Mantracker, with his straight-shootin', lawman/goodguy character, he could be a hard act to follow for the format.  And the ladies love him. There goes that demographic.   "
552553,acrimi,2011-02-17 15:43:00,18,cant say i was a huge fan.
