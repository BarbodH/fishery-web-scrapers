550250,Dara,2011-02-11 03:26:00,3052,They have a nice canal in the middle of town. Not sure if them city slickers will let you drill holes in the ice though.
550324,Seaweed,2011-02-11 14:02:00,135,Hi  March is big fish time around Ottawa.  Try Petrie Island just on the eastern edge of town.  It offers some nice sheltered bays that hold the safe ice longest in the area.  There is a baitshop there also.  Enjoy.  Dara the only fish in the Rideau canal are not worth fishing for... but some do in areas of Dows Lake.
550350,muskymike,2011-02-11 14:49:00,772,"Petrie is great if you are in the East end of the city, if he lives in the west, there are thousands of lakes north of Carleton Place/Perth or West into the Frontenac region.  I live in Perth and work in the city, it takes me 45-55 to get to Kanata (right by the Scotia Bank Place) its another 45 mins to Petrie from there...  Good Luck, see if MuskyMatt can chime in, or ya, go to Fish-hawk. Those guys should be able to help out"
550365,fishhunter,2011-02-11 15:31:00,604,WELL IF 2-12LB WALLEYE ARE NOT WORTH IT AND SLAB CRAPPIE WELL THEN GUESS HE IS RIGHT. WHEN I LIVED IN OTTAWA WE FISHED THE CANAL FOR OVER 20 YEARS. SOMETIME IT TAKES FISHING WATERS NOT JUST DRIVING BY
550367,fishhunter,2011-02-11 15:34:00,604,CONSTANCE LAKE IS JUST OUT SIDE OF OTTAWA 25 MIN DRIVE. FULL OF PIKE AND PERCH AND SLAB CRAPPIE. END OF THE CANAL WHERE IT MEETS THE OTTAWA LOTS OF FISH. LONG ISLAND IS GOOD. IF YOUR LOOKING FOR TROUT AN HOUR OUTSIDE OF OTTAWA PM ME
551969,walleye_man,2011-02-16 01:43:00,135,I know there's a new ice fishing guide that operates mostly out of the east end. From what I hear he has a nice set-up and I think he even refunds you if you don't get any fish. According to his facebook this is his website www.ottawariverfishing.ca
