552333,GBW,2011-02-17 00:05:00,8460,correct.  I have a few buddies that are firefighter's.
552356,d_paluch,2011-02-17 01:43:00,343,all emergency service men/women are heroes in my books...with some exceptions obviously  truly amazing in this case though
552373,I'mHooked,2011-02-17 02:35:00,525,Just back from a night of Hazmat / Decon training at the station. Haven't heard of this yet?
552584,John the Fisherman,2011-02-17 16:56:00,45,"I think the word Hero is used a little too much these days for trivial acts of kindness and action.  Those who apply to become FF's and police do not fill out an application for the position of ""Hero"".  Give me a break.  They are doing the job they are paid to do.  It is only those in the general public who are to scared to weak and sometimes to stupid who bust out the word ""Hero""  Maybe I get this attitude from my father (now 87) who was with the Irish Regiment during WWII when they broke through the Hitler Line, as well as Casino, and eventually went up to Belguim. Risking your life when it is in peril to save another is a fine example.  Making a phone call to 911 when someone is having a heart attack is not a good definition of a Hero. Just my opinion  JTF"
552612,I'mHooked,2011-02-17 18:33:00,525," You'd be surprised. I'm sure there are a few misguided ""applicants"" who think they are applying for a ""hero"" position. As a seasoned VOLUNTEER firefighter, I've seen a few of these people through the ranks. These are the ones that are attempted to be weeded out through the hiring process. I like to think of my fellow VOLUNTEER & CAREER firefighters as ""calculated risk"" takers. Training & proficiency is what allows us to attempt things that your average person would potentially be more in harms way to try.  As a volunteer, 1Â½ weeks ago I was 'paid' with the memory of the poor sole who's lifeless body I helped recover from Lake Ontario. Not the kind of remuneration you can put in the bank, but hey, someone has to step up.  In my books, the teachers that run an after school homework club at my child's school are heroes. I've had the pleasure of knowing some WWII heroes as well."
552710,Big Cliff,2011-02-17 22:14:00,6899," Crawling into a burning, smoke filled house on your hands and knees 8 times to try to find and rescue someone isn't exactly my idea of a ""trivial acts of kindness and action"".  As far as ""It is only those in the general public who are to scared to weak and sometimes to stupid who bust out the word ""Hero""""  I may be old and don't have a great education but I don't think I am stupid or weak! I do think that someone who risks their life by going to such lengths to save the life of another person that they don't even know is a hero! Being paid or not!"
552744,Rustic-Fisher,2011-02-17 23:03:00,826,Sounds like someone failed the aptitude test for police and/or fire LOL....... bitter or what  :rolleyes:
552745,knightfisher,2011-02-17 23:03:00,237,Hero
552753,smally21,2011-02-17 23:17:00,993,"riding the fence here.  a FF enters a burning house with a million dollars of equipment, training, experience and education, thus reducing the risks. (note reduceing, not eliminating)  A civilian enters a burning house with none of those things, thus assuming great risk.  If an on duty FF entered a house alone, with no equipment, he would be branded an idiot and fired.  If an off duty FF or civilian does it, they are a hero.  succesful rescuers are heroes, unsuccessful rescuers are considered foolhardy, or dead.  an electrician goes to work, does his job and wires up a bunch of pot lights, no one cares. a FF goes to work, does his job and rescues woman from burning house and is a hero.  this is a great story and a great outcome by a special kind of person. im not going after anyone here, just raising some interesting points. does the job make you a hero, or the act? is it a greater act for a citizen to do it than a professional?  FF's perform a unique job and assume considerable risk. acts like this are commendable."
552813,Rustic-Fisher,2011-02-18 00:57:00,826,"If your neighbors house was on fire and they were trapped in the home  would you try and find them???? I like to think that most people would make a reasonable attempt, and that makes them a hero for their heroic actions no matter what the outcome is. A Firefighter is paid to arrive on the scene size up the risks, determine the appropriate action and initiate the appropriate rescue attempt with proper equipment to minimize the risk to themselves and crew. As a full time firefighter do I consider myself a hero?? ABSOLUTELY NOT!!! I just do what most of you would do if you came across any situation with someone in distress, try and help. I just have fancy tools and a big red truck LOL. A guy running into a burning building 8 times without proper equipment to make a rescue takes balls. Does not matter if your an off duty firefighter, cop, teacher, or tradesmen your a hero for putting it on the line in that situation."
552987,John the Fisherman,2011-02-18 15:07:00,45,"FYI I never even read the article.  I had no idea about the burning building part.  But that's not what I'm knocking.  Thats cool and exactly what makes a fine example of the proper use of the word ""Hero"".  He could have lost his life to save another.  Actually putting ones self in peril.  Hell...I worked MNR Fire for over decade as an I.A crew leader. Saw, and worked on some big fires.  Layed miles of hose  in those years.  Met alot of cool people as well.  I never put myself or my crew in peril because its just wood. Jasper... ABSOLUTELY NOT. I wouldn't either.  Structural and Forests are two different fires of course. I did my job, and that was that at the end of the day. Maybe it is the media who throw out the word just to catch ones attention for the evening news for instances lke I mentioned in my previous post. I am not out to offend anyone, I am just emphasizing the use of Hero."
553037,spinnerbaitking,2011-02-18 17:28:00,1622, Unbelievable not even 3 lines in the post & you make a comment without even reading it just saying HERO SBK
