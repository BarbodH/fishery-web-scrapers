I have posted this link for the support of specialized support for the inclusion of special needs children in the new kindergarten program that has $1.5 billion funding.There is a video and a link to email the premier & your local MPP to encourage them to look at the importance of also funding the inclusion of special needs children to attend kindergarten. Some of these children may have these needs from birth,some may have theses needs from recovering from medical challenges they have had during their formative years. The best place for any human to develop is within a social network of their peers.Thank you.   http://www.oacrs.com/"
