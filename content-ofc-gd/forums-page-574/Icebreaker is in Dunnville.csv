552606,Spiel,2011-02-17 18:13:00,9065," No doubt, but the forecasted temps and rain (if they happen) will likely look after the rest of the river."
552613,bdox,2011-02-17 18:34:00,329,It's got some work cut out for it. We took a drive out that way on the weekend and stopped at Port Maitland. Ice out on Erie as far as I could see.
552698,johndox,2011-02-17 21:54:00,54,already lots of water laying on top of the ice out front of the house here in Cayuga. Hopefully it will get cold again real soon and the ice will stay in.
