531063,GBW,2010-12-22 21:59:00,8460,An uncle of mine got it and has been using it now for a few months.  I'll see him in a few days to see if it's helped him quit smoking.  PM me after Christmas to remind me to let you know.  Cheers.  Geoff
531355,bassman,2010-12-23 19:10:00,384,I just went ahead an ordered a starter kit last night. I'll provide my feedback in the new year.  Cheers!
531357,lookinforwalleye,2010-12-23 19:19:00,4399,Hey Ari if quitting is your goal then you might want to try Champix worked for me 10 months smoke free!  Good luck
552506,bassman,2011-02-17 14:07:00,384,"I've been using the e-cigs for about 1 1/2 months, and although it's not exactly like smoking a real cigarette, it's pretty darn close. I've reduced my intake approximately 95%(I still crave the odd real one) and I've saved enough dough to buy some fishing stuff. There are a ton of companies out there, but I settled on a US company that had some good publicity and reviews. The cool thing is that I'm smoking these things everywhere, at work, in the house, at the pub.  Anyways, I went with the company below, and I even started a Facebook page. If you guys have any questions, feel free to ping me anytime.  My link  My link"
552539,Joey,2011-02-17 15:04:00,9122,"Interesting link.  I was not aware they had nicotine in them, thought they were just vapor.  So you smoke them and then occasionally have a real cig?  Joey"
552567,bassman,2011-02-17 16:17:00,384,  Aint nothing like the real thing......but this is a close 2nd.
552609,Flappn,2011-02-17 18:24:00,245,What's the plan to get off the electronic Cig? That's the part I don't understand...if it has nicotine in it...your still addicted? I used champix like lookinforwalleye and it worked although even after two and a hlaf years...I still miss the little sexy white sticks daily. Oh well at least I can fight the attraction now. It's like that old girl friend in high school that was no good for you....but man was she ever fun!
552622,bassman,2011-02-17 19:16:00,384, The plan is to inhale only the nicotine and not the other 4000 chemicals.
552630,Flappn,2011-02-17 19:34:00,245,"I have heard and can not confirm that the bottle the ""vapor nicotine"" comes in has a skull and bones on it and says do not ingest?"
552660,Chugger,2011-02-17 20:34:00,109,"Hey Folks.  I smoked most of my life and finally managed to quit this past September after trying many different methods.  I got laser therapy to stop smoking.  Most people I tell of this are shocked and call it a hoax, but after watching a buddy do it a year ago and remain smoke free, myself and another guy gave it a shot.  happy to report that was back on September 17th, and I'm still smoke free as is the other guy that tried it.  I don't even think about it any more.  It cost me a total of $300.00.  if anyone wants details, PM me and I'll get you the info.  Best, -Graeme"
