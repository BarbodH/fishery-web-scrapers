They want to throw off the shackles, and rid themselves of the despots who have made them miserable.  Question: How long will it be before Toronto Maple Leafs fans realise that this might work?"
552364,Skud,2011-02-17 02:11:00,739,Who are the Toronto Maple Leafs?
552365,skeeter,2011-02-17 02:15:00,1907,well its been 43 years now. im thinking that 50 is the golden number
552380,Pigeontroller,2011-02-17 02:49:00,2793,"I don't think its very cool to equate what happened in Egypt, and what will hopefully happen elsewhere in the Middle East, with a proffessional Sports Franchise. Show some class..."
552382,solopaddler,2011-02-17 03:00:00,8605,  I'm just tired of the potshots.
552392,Gregoire,2011-02-17 03:14:00,1397, Spoken like a true leafs fan
552394,GBW,2011-02-17 03:16:00,8460,"Did he need to put ""JOKE"" in this?  Oh and it's almost mallow and flossing season too.  give it a few more weeks..."
552395,Pigeontroller,2011-02-17 03:16:00,2793,"Nope, not a potshot...I'm serious, people that are not as fortunate as us to be born in a free country are showing incredible bravery and standing up to their oppressive leaders and we should not be turning it into a joke!"
552418,[emailÂ protected],2011-02-17 03:49:00,119,"haha, you don't really think WE are free do you?? we have a perverted version of freedom, that's all, but yes we are fortunate, as there are worse places to be."
552420,Grimace,2011-02-17 03:51:00,2020,I think if making jokes about starving children in third world nations is classless and repulsive.  This is not that.  The fact that what is happening is positive and worth getting excited about would seperate it.  People are demanding their freedom from these despots and this is worth celebrating.  Throw in a Leafs joke and it is fine because the joke is about the Leafs not the people.  I really think you are stretching here.  I happen to think Dave is a pretty classy dude and innocent on the charge you are laying.
552427,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2011-02-17 04:05:00,0,this thread is deep maaaaaaaaaan!  *inhales*
552544,Dave Bailey,2011-02-17 15:26:00,1641,"I'm certain that the people in those oppressed lands have a sense of humour, but their chances of expressing it have been as restricted as anything else. Try making a joke about the government or the religion and you'll find someone knocking on your door. We have that freedom, and if you don't exercise a freedom don't be surprised if it's taken away someday.  But just in case it needed to be said, IT'S A JOKE!  There, is that okay?  I think it's even more ridiculous to get upset about someone making disparaging remarks about a sports team."
552558,acrimi,2011-02-17 15:55:00,18,  now your on to something......  Rally for today..  noon ACC     be there with Canadians jersey's:(

552573,Mike Pike,2011-02-17 16:27:00,1332,I don't think so.  Jokes are funny.
552577,mercman,2011-02-17 16:39:00,7054,"Not sure if this is off topic, but i deal with people on a daily basis.I find that over the last 6-8 months, people are becoming extremely aggressive and distrusful.I like to treat my csutomers the same way i want to be treated when i go into a store, but lately i'm starting to feel like the soup nazi on Seinfeld.  I just want to tell all the obnoxious ones NO PARTS FOR YOU TODAY !!!!! GET OUT !!!"
