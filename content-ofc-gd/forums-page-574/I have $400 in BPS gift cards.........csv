551931,msp,2011-02-16 00:46:00,1336,"I have to agree with Smally21 on the reel. I think that if you are looking for a primary spinning rod that will meet most of your needs, I would suggest going with a Medium/Heavy action rod. Use 15# braid and you can use this set up for everything....grubs, tubes, bucktail jigs,senkos even jerk baits. All rod manufacturers have what your looking for. You have to go and check em out for yourself and see how they feel in your hands.Good luck"
551981,Raddi55,2011-02-16 02:02:00,5," Just an FYI for anyone interested in the old Supreme XTs. I was at BPS tonight, I wanted to pick up the 9030XT but they sold out this morning. Looks like they still have a good number of 9035 and 9040 models though..I resisted temptation...but now I'm kind of kicking myself for not letting my impulses get the better of me for once...oh well, Spring classic is comin' up fast...  That or I may have to boot back down to Vaughan after class tomorrow.."
552045,Cudz,2011-02-16 04:34:00,2652,"I was there tonight and they had 2 9035s left and a guy beside me was buying one.  I too resisted temptation and would have bought if the 9030 was there.  I asked about more coming in and they said maybe, no guarantee that stocks will be replaced as they are last year's model. I did however pick up a nice new carbonlite rod for $69 and a pair of waterproof boots rated for -100 degrees F.  Not sure it they will be that warm but they are waterproof which is a step up from my current pair."
552050,archie_james_c,2011-02-16 05:19:00,618,"  To say that one cheap spinning rod does everything but you *need* to have good and various casting setups is kinda foolish. Inexpensive Med-Lite rods are not ""sensitive"" they are noodly. ""Sensitivity"" in a rod equates to stiffness, and how much info off of your line/bait can be telegraphed through the rod into your hand.  I'm not saying casting rigs are a waste of money either...if you use alot of casting specific techniques then buy the best gear you can afford. But to suggest spinning gear as a whole is unimportant is kind of foolish."
552054,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2011-02-16 06:42:00,0,with 400 dollars i'd likely buy 2 combos.
552084,Billy Bob,2011-02-16 12:43:00,5865,"$400 dollars in gift cards should be treat just like cash.....stretched out by only purchasing ""things"" that are on sale. Spending it on a rod & reel combo would be a huge waste of money IMHO....A $100 - $150 combo will catch just as many fish.  Do you need shirts or shorts for the up coming summer months. Check out BPS's CLEARANCE section on their website.  I ONLY shop in Cabela's Bargain Cave because eventually the products I am looking for end up there and sometimes I save as much as 50% off. Retail prices are for suckers.....  Good Luck Shopping and be patient, Bob"
552098,Harrison,2011-02-16 13:41:00,2202,"Smalliefisher has some wicked deals in the classified section for some high end stuff.  Who knows, he may consider the BPS card as cash moola. Have an eye."
553069,ckrb2007,2011-02-18 19:52:00,449,Thanks for all the input guys!  Colin
551269,ckrb2007,2011-02-14 02:33:00,449,I have received $400.00 in gift cards from family at x-mas and my b-day. What multi-purpose spinning rod and reel would you get? I'm leaning towards a Stradic reel but appreciate other opinions. I'm stuck on a rod though?!??!  Appreciate the feedback everyone!!  Colin
551273,ripsomelips,2011-02-14 02:39:00,51,"Hey,     The Stradic is an amazing reel and i have it paired with a G Loomis GL3. If you don't mind paying a little more i would say that's the best combo!  "
551284,kickingfrog,2011-02-14 03:01:00,8333,"Oh the choices. Figure out what it is you are going to use it for. A rod that works for crankbaits, would not be a great jig rod for example. If you are looking for a rod that will do many things it might be a bit harder to pick one.  What other rods do you have?  Are you replacing your main rod, or are you diversifying?  What do you fish for?  How do you fish? Shore, boat, casting, trolling, still, bait?  You may want to pick a rod and then pick the reel, or at least the size.  If you are just starting to build a arsonal of tackle you might consider a 2500 size stradic (since you mentioned it already) and two rods in the $100 range.  The reel will last and you can upgrade the rods later.  I would wait until the spring sale that bps has in March. There will be rods on sale and reels can get a discount if you bring in a old reel for trade in."
551289,Pigeontroller,2011-02-14 03:07:00,2793,Check out a St.Croix Avid
551290,uglyfish,2011-02-14 03:07:00,981,"quantum energy pti30, solid reel. looks great and performs even better. i believe its a bit cheaper then the stradic and in my opinion is better then the stradic. as for a rod, really depends on what ur lookin to use it for ."
551297,Gregoire,2011-02-14 03:13:00,1397,For reels I would look at the shimano stradic (CI4 or FI) 2500 and the pflueger supreme xt and patriarch 9530. For rods I would look at the st croix avid and the shimano crucial I am partial to 7'. Medium power should cover most species. Mix and match to see what you feels right. If you wanted some money left over BPS offers the Stradic FI and the Supreme XT paired up with a house brand carbonlite rod that seems to be nice.
551308,MCTFisher9120,2011-02-14 03:30:00,3761,Get a St Croix Avid spinning(love mine) and get a Saros 2500 or Stradic 2500....should be enough cash for the setup.
551317,lookinforwalleye,2011-02-14 04:06:00,4399,wait for the Spring Classic!
551322,Cudz,2011-02-14 04:13:00,2652,cumura and stratic.
551370,ckrb2007,2011-02-14 14:13:00,449,"Great information so far guys! I appreciate it. I'm basically looking for an all 'round, multi-species rod, thinking a 7' rod and 2500 series reel. I'm not one of those guys who has 15 different rod/reel combos. I have a fairly good baitcaster and a few lower end spinning combos so I was looking to get a good spinning rod and reel set-up. I do fish a lot in the kawarthas for walleye and bass.  Thanks again for the input!  Colin"
551374,asdve23rveavwa,2011-02-14 14:32:00,2690," Words of wisdom...I second this!!!  You will get better deals, for sure."
551405,perchslayer666,2011-02-14 16:19:00,280,"Wait for the spring classic, and don't forget to bring in an older reel you don't use anymore for more savings on a nice reel.... Get there early though, cause most of the sales stuff will be greatly depleted by the 1st weekend."
551410,bdox,2011-02-14 16:26:00,329,"Don't expect any deals on rods, unless you want Bass Pro crap. To get any deal on a reel other than Bass Pro/Browning, you'll have to trade in an old one."
551516,ckrb2007,2011-02-14 20:12:00,449,"Does anyone have any feedback on those ""carrot stix"" rods?? I see them used a lot on WFN......especially down south. Just wondering if they're any good."
551523,jedimaster,2011-02-14 20:30:00,3472,"I have heard very mixed reviews on the carrot stix from Tournament bass guys. I woudl second the Cumara/Stradic setup. I have a cumar with an E7, and I love the rod. I would love to upgrade a few Vrods for some cumara's for my stradic's"
551525,Drew_10,2011-02-14 20:34:00,111,"Whatever rod you buy, make sure it has a lifetime warranty.  In my opinion, that's gotta be one of the most important things.  From my experiance, BPS was great about giving me an over the counter replacement for a crucial I snapped a few years ago."
551571,scugpg,2011-02-14 22:20:00,1373,Will BPS match prices elsewhere? If something isn't on sale maybe you can look around and see if you can get them to match.
551618,uglyfish,2011-02-15 00:52:00,981,lol its kinda pointless asking for opinions on what rod or reel to get.... too many guys have a hard-on for shimano and all u get are bias opinions from shimano guys
551630,Gregoire,2011-02-15 01:16:00,1397," I think that is a kind of unfair statement. While I do find that there is a bias towards shimano products here, it is for good reason. With the proximity to the Peterborough office, and a reputation for quality. While they may not be the best choice for everyone they should be considered and compared by people looking to purchase new equipment. If the poster was looking for less expensive gear I would point him towards some less expensive gear. On that note I would compare a rapala r-type rod and reel to the more expensive gear and see what you like. A combo of that sort would be about half the cost and may suit your needs. The one thing I will say is don't just get a stradic because people on this forum tell you too. Look at all the gear in your price range a buy what feels good in your hand."
551639,ckrb2007,2011-02-15 01:32:00,449,"Well said fishgreg. After reading the posts thus far, and one in particular, I'm now leaning towards getting one good spinning reel and a couple semi-good rods. I understand my question was kind of in the same boat of ""what truck is better....ford, chevy or dodge"".....but I'm just looking for opinions, options and ideas.  Keep the ""ideas"" coming guys...you're helping me out a lot!  Colin"
551646,smally21,2011-02-15 01:38:00,993,"this might not be helpful but i wouldn't put that much money into a spinning combo. while i love my stradics, i get equivalent, or at least good enough performance from reels like a sedona for half the money. inexpensive med light spinning rods have great feel and are less trouble to maintain, or pitch if they break. i put the bigger dollars into baitcasting setups where it seems to matter more. but hey, a stradic with a compre/crucial setup would be a nice way to use the gift card!"
551674,Gregoire,2011-02-15 02:55:00,1397,"Also check out Tackletour.com it has reviews and a good forum. It has reviews of a lot of gear. Also try the basspro website, as it has reviews of gear as well."
551695,archie_james_c,2011-02-15 03:51:00,618,"A 7 foot, medium power, fast action St.Croix Legend Tournament Bass series rod- 220$  Daiwa Tierra 2500 reel- 149$ ish  OR for the Loomis guys...  Loomis IMX Spin/Jig series 7 foot, medium power, fact action- 290$ (SJR844S)  Pflueger Supreme XT (that new magnesium bodied one)- 149$  Thats what I look at or some variation of those if I wanted one, super nice, multi-purpose rod/reel."
551702,Cudz,2011-02-15 04:38:00,2652,Damn last year's pflueger supreme xt with magnesium body is on sale at bps for $69.88.  That would be a great real.
551742,sauce,2011-02-15 14:14:00,219,"A stradic 2500 FI and two compres. Lots of actions and lengths available in one piece and two. $400 probably wont cover it, but you aren't over budget by much. One thing to note, the new generation of super light reels (stradic CI4 and pfleuger patriarch etc.) don't balance well on most rods. If you buy one of these reels, you will also need a very light rod to fully appreciate the advantages."
