552457,Terry,2011-02-17 10:47:00,14456,"if Off Duty Firefighter is a hero what can you say about an ON Duty Taxi Driver  that does the same thing  http://www.bradfordtimes.ca/ArticleDisplay.aspx?e=2981153 Hero cabbie By Miriam King Posted 18 hours ago   Residents of 38 Ondrey Street in Bradford had a narrow escape, early Sunday morning, February 6.  At about 2 a.m., a passing cab driver observed flames and smoke coming from the home, and pounded on the door to awaken the occupants of the two rental units, while his dispatcher called 911.  Fire Chief Kevin Gallant said that although it was reported as a ""chimney fire,"" the working fire actually originated in an exterior wall, and was believed to be electrical in origin. The fire had been burning for some time before it was reported, and spread both to the roof, via a PVC plumbing vent, and to the basement, when burning embers dropped and ignited materials there.  Firefighters had to break through the roof to get to the flames. The home suffered ""extensive"" smoke and water damage.  The raised bungalow, which had been divided into two rental units, had no smoke alarms at the time of the fire, and Chief Gallant confirmed that charges are pending .  He noted that the fire department provides free smoke alarms and batteries to homeowners as part of a public education effort, through its summer Home Smoke Alarm Program, ""but landlords not meeting the requirements under the Fire Code - that's a different story... Landlords do have an obligation.""  All 5 of the occupants were able to escape without injury, thanks to the actions of Town Taxi driver Richard Duncan.  ""I dropped off a fare on Ondrey, and took the long way to Town - and I noticed a lot of flames coming from the roof,"" Duncan said. He immediately called his dispatcher, then went to rouse the occupants.  ""I pretty much punched in the window of the door,"" trying to get the attention of the upstairs residents - a teen-aged babysitter and 3 children, Duncan said. ""The two younger ones didn't want to get out of the house. I picked up the youngest like he was a football.""  He then went to the basement door, and ""banged on the door while dodging pieces of eavestrough"" from the burning roof. He had to kick in the door to alert the female occupant, and her dog, as the room filled with smoke.  Duncan suffered minor smoke inhalation when he went back inside to pull a laptop from the building, ""to save their memories."""
