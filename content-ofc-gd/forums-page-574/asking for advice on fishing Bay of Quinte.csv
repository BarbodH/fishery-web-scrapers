552593,ehg,2011-02-17 17:48:00,2666,Haven't been to Quinte for a few years but found some areas around Belleville produced when i started out. One was going south off 401 down wallbridge-loyalist Rd. straight to water. Parking was there and fish were caught. Using jigging raps tipped with emerald shiner heads or swedish pimples with whole emerald shiner worked well.Jigged off the bottom around green buoys halfway across. The area across the big bridge called Massassauga Pt. in around 20 ft. of water using same techniques worked. Careful on the ice this weekend with this thaw. Good Luck
