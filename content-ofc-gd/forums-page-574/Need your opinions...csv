There's always OCAP complaints or walk in complains. Most likely the officer in charge will direct you to ocaps. If he's a young guy on the service he needs to be brought down a peg"

I will file a formal complaint..with him 'cause I really trust the Man I would have thought that his first talking to would have set him straight but it just seemed to jack him up.. Unless he decides to start a rumble I'll steer clear of him... and if he does I'll do my best to turn the other cheek.  It just angers me to see someone with authority abusing it.  Randy

Sounds to me like he needs to be taken into the alley by a few of his fellow officers.  The decent cops don't want a bad name becasue of this putz."

553011,mercman,2011-02-18 16:08:00,7054,Something just doesnt sound right here.I cant figure out why the cop would have just talked down to you without cause. I'm sure this is not the first time you have seen him on duty.Has he always been this way Randy ? You said he was a school buddy. Was he this way back then too?Maybe someone pee'd in his cornflakes that morning Ya didnt mess with his girl back in the good ole days did ya?
553012,bassassin,2011-02-18 16:12:00,152,"If you know you can physically take him then he probably knows it too! Thus dont even go there because itll be bad news for everyone involved, before the altercation and being pulled over there was no major issue and im sure after a couple of weeks of not fanning the flames this will all subside...  just my 2 cents, that or just knock him out cold with a sucker punch when hes off duty and take compromising pics of him while hes out with his pants off while in the company of another man, then just hold the pics over his head for the rest of your lives....  either or!"
553044,Muskieman,2011-02-18 17:59:00,2472,"Well.....  I just got back from the Police Station... I was greeted at the window by the one and only ""Constable Mike Davis""  He politely asked can I help you Mr.Kirkwood... I told him that I would like to file a formal complaint on his truly and I asked for another constable.  Our new Police Chief then assisted me... WOW talk about good service...  I was questioned about what causes I had to want to file such complaints. We logged onto OFC so he could see for himself.... Hmmm... I then asked if I could get in trouble for posting such a topic On-Line... he re-read it and said no. Since I didn't use the Officers real name nor the name of the Detachment or other Officers I was OK. PHEWWW!! Word of my being pulled over in December had long ago came to his attention by way of my Buddy the Staff Sargent.  Instead of having me file the complaint against said Officer ... he called him to the office and sat him right beside me like a School Principal would do... he then reiterated my claim and asked if they were true...Cnst Davis quickly said ""Yes Sir"".  Our Chief asked me if a formal apology and a handshake would suffice... I hesitated and said Yes. The Constable then extended his hand and said ""Mr.Kirkwood ,I'm sorry for what I have done to you and you can be assured that it will never happen again""... WOW!  Holy Friggin' professional!  The Chief asked me if there was anything else ... I had nothing to say but Thank You... he let me out of his office and SLAMMED the door shut with said Constable still sitting in there.  I think that he may have been a little angry  I feel better now that I know the Chief himself has an eye on him.  All is well that ends well...thanks for all the advice guys ... I'm glad I didn't do anything drastic..  Mr. Kirkwood "

That being said; this cop must have an ego the size of King Kong’s. With today’s wealth of information, at anyone’s finger tips (internet) where you can easily find, legal documented means of combating someone like this; he still tries to brow beat you? He’s either very full of himself or has mental issues; thinking you’d cower and take his crap? For him too even try this, he should had been forced to have a sociological evaluation performed; he needs professional help! Will a person like this stop or will he just pick his next victim a little more carefully? Someone that he feels doesn’t have the resources and can hold that person under his thumb; as too fuel his ego? Scary stuff when someone in police uniform and supposedly trusted, invades your life for personal means; whatever they be?  Dan."

I just picked up my kids from school and was chatted up by a friend that had seen my truck at the Police Station this morning.. he asked me if something was up. I told him what I was there for. He already knew of my being pulled over in December and went on to say that .. the Officer in question has many complaints against him , hear say? maybe? I, for the sake of this small town, hope that he calms down and acts like a professional from now on."

He's a guy my age that I played football in school with. ***  Officers name has been changed*** When I  got pulled over .. I rolled down my window and said "" Eh, Mike "" he said "" If you see me having a beer in town on Friday or Saturday night you can call me Mike.. but today you're gonna call me Constable Davis""  I asked him why he pulled me over and he said ""You were on the Phone""... I denied it and gave him consent to check my car... he did ...While huffing and puffing he checked the glove box and the console storage.... no phone to be found.  He had witnessed me putting a pen in my hat.  He then said ""Randy, you can leave now""  I said ... Constable Davis.. ""If you see me in town on Friday or Saturday night having a beer you can call me Randy .. but today you're gonna call me Mr.Kirkwood""  he chuckled used a few choice words and went back to his cruiser.

It got around the office and his peers are razzing him... most of his peers are good friends of mine too.  Now... I was out last Saturday and so was he Cnst Davis. He was being really loud and throwing me insults..  I shrugged it off.. and left for another establishment... not long after he showed up at the same place.. still being an arrogant   . I was playing pool with another friend and Cnst Davis..Intentionally stepped on my foot and hit my cue just before I took a shot and made me scratch...  I know that he's looking for a physical confrontation... I also know that I can take this guy if ever it would happen.  And to top it all off he pulled my wife over today and tried to find something to charge her with ... from inspecting the truck and delaying her lunch hour by 25 minutes before letting her go without an apology or a fine. He's driven by my house 6 times within the past 2 hours.  My question ... is he always on duty?  and if he is and I'm pretty sure that I'd win the battle... what would be my charge and what would be his. I tried getting hold of his boss today ... but he's in Florida  Randy "
552792,Twocoda,2011-02-18 00:24:00,4130,"hold off on doing anything stupid...when his boss comes back from holidays >>file a formal complaint against him as a member of the PD and a restraining order against him as a civilian...  if you think it will help....next time you see him as ""Mike"" ask him whats up his ass and if you can give him a hand replacing it with your foot"

That documentation can get him transferred - I assume he is OPP, then your problem is gone. If he is a townie, then you may have to go after his job. Sounds like one of the type of cops we don't like. In a fight, he who yells first loses."
552797,Gregoire,2011-02-18 00:30:00,1397,"This guy obviously has a grudge against you. Getting in a fight with a cop is never a good idea. Although you are friends with his boss and with some of his co-workers, there are probably other people he works with who don't know you, or may have it in for you as well. You could document everything that happened to you and your wife, and record when you see him drive by your house. Find a place to talk to him and tell him you have everything documented, and if he doesn't lay off you'll file a formal complaint."
552800,BillM,2011-02-18 00:31:00,17367,"He's always on duty, but I gotta ask, why even mention it to his boss in the first place?  If he was laughing after the fact, you probably should have to and left it at that."

If it persists after that contact the local media.  If this officer is smart he'll let it go otherwise he'll most likely be unemployed."

""The test in policing is not dissimilar. Courts of law and tribunals have consistently ruled that the police complaint process captures off duty conduct, so long as a nexus exists between the impugned off duty conduct and either public respect for the constabulary or the fitness of the police officer to hold the office of constable.""  if you really beleive he is ""out ta get ya"".  avoid at all costs. get hold of unit commander or equivalent or professional standards branch. they might tell ya to get lost, or not, but at least you have a record of your complaint.  hopefully it just blows over. you're not going to win, if you know what i'm saying. but officers have codes of professional conduct too. this situation has lose lose lose written all over it. a good time to be the bigger man and stay out of it.  good luck with your problem!"

I spent 75$ on the camera and it saved me 500$ in parking violations.A neighbour really hated us, being a home renter at the time in the area. FYI, not to bump the thread in any means, A little birdy told me that a ticket left on your vehicle, with hand written #s and letters at the top of it, Is a called in violation,by whom ever.And double check that the ticket is fully filled out.If not they cant process it legally."
552821,muddler,2011-02-18 01:17:00,623,"When I pick up my kids from my Ex, I'm usually alone. I have a voice activated recorder that records everything and it sits in my front shirt pocket. I minimize saying anything to my Ex as she is very good at putting on a performance and fudging the truth when she wants to. On one occasion I was accused of bad mouthing her/verbal abuse  and her lawyer sent me a very strong letter. I downloaded the brief conversation that we had that day(I'm always polite and tolerent) and burned it onto a Cd. Sent the CD as evidence to her lawyer. I got a wriitten apology from my Ex and the lawyer. She says nothing now when we exchange the kids. Case closed.  The point is that you may have to go to these types of extremes to protect yourself. It is not against the law for you to record your own conversation.  So instead of ""he said.....I said..."", you have hard evidence should you ever need it. Documentation is good too, but nothing beats pictures a, video and/or audio.  This is harassment that you are getting. I live in a small town too and we have had a few Officers that have tried  similar stuff to what you are describing. With a little effort and written complaints with some HARD evidence, these guys moved back to Toronto.  As long as you are not breaking any law you are allowed to have the peace of mind that everyone has a right to expect. Check the Canadian Bill of rights.  If driving by your house 6 times a day is bothering you, I'd take apicture with a time stamp on it. Colect as much evidence as you can then file a complaint. If it escalates and you go to court you have atone of evidence. Keep two copies of everything  just incase.    muddler"

To me the line is messing with my family.  Having pulled your wife over for no reason and harassing her I would certainly say bring it to the attention of his superiors.  More formally this time.  And like others have said document every single last thing and if you can get some hard evidence.  They won't be able to just ignore it and if you aren't satisfied with the result then go to the media.  Whatever you decide to do I hope it works out for you and he gets what he deserves.
