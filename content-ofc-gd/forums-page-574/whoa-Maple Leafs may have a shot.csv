552489,ADB,2011-02-17 13:38:00,444, Exactly.
552504,tb4me,2011-02-17 14:00:00,3295,"Even if they dont make it at least were out of the lottery, for now.. Perhaps we can trade Kabs to boston for our pick back!! if that happens bring on tank nation!! get back into the lottery. we get 2 first round draft pick then...hmmmm.. None the less the last 2 games have been nothing short of amazing.. Burke has this team heading in the right direction, Finally.."
552512,solopaddler,2011-02-17 14:14:00,8605," I do like the stable of young defensemen they're accumulating.  Schenn, Phaneuf, Gunnarsonn, Aulie. Waiting in the wings Jake Gardiner, Matt Lashoff and Jesse Blacker.  Things are looking great in the back end.  Up front say what you want but Kessel is a game breaker and Grabovski has been a revelation. Man what a gritty little player!  Reimer looks great if he can keep it up..  It's not all doom and gloom."
552518,jedimaster,2011-02-17 14:23:00,3472,"Maybe they will trade kessel and kaberle for the number one pick they gave up, then they will surge to 9th place and get another junk draft pick.  Anwesome week of hockey though. They look like a totally different team when reimer is in net."
552647,jimmer,2011-02-17 20:11:00,2730,"At least they're a littler easier to watch now. Go Leafs Go! Us die hards will always hang in there, no matter what others say. I like the post that mentions most bashers as being Red Wing or Penguin fans. So true!"
552666,stubbex1,2011-02-17 20:45:00,164,"I love leaf fans,  always optimistic about how their team is going do the beginning of the season, with the media hype of the ""star"" players they  have acquired over the summer.  I have quite a few die-hard leaf fan's for friends, and every September for the last 4 years we make bets if the  Leafs are going to make the playoffs or not.  Come April I have enough 60oz'rs to last me half a year.  GO FLAMES!!!!!"
552671,solopaddler,2011-02-17 21:07:00,8605, I agree go Flames.  Please make another trade with the Leafs.  Maybe the two best trades this franchise has ever made brought Dougie to town and last year Phaneuf and Aulie for bunch of useless spare parts.
552679,stubbex1,2011-02-17 21:28:00,164," Right, because he's playing like a 6.5 million dollar defenseman should this year's number's  Phaneuf - 2 G 13 A  -8 Sjostrom - 2 G 3 A  -5 Aulie -  0 G 0 A  -5  Stajan - 5 G 22 A +7 Hagman - 9 G 15A -1 Babchuk -  5 G 15 A +9 Kostopolous - 4 G 2 A +6  Everyone is talking about how Calgary lost the trade but I don't see it. Sure, Stajan at 3.5 mil looks pretty bad and Hagman has been inconsistent at times, but IMO Phaneuf hasn't been that much better than Babchuk, who is 1/5th the price. We got rid of a $6.5 million overhyped primadonna of a defenseman with a huge ego, who is already been trashed by the Toronto fans 1 year later.  "
552693,solopaddler,2011-02-17 21:45:00,8605," Buddy any sane gm would make that trade the leafs did 10 times over and twice on Sunday.  He's been playing pretty steady lately, flashes of the Phaneuf of old.  Like Sam Pollack said, whoever gets the best player wins the trade.  The Leafs did by a landslide.  And the best player in that trade may very well turn out to be Aulie."
552699,stubbex1,2011-02-17 21:55:00,164," lets agree to disagree on this one then, regardless.... those 60's are gonna taste real good  if not, i'll enjoy Phaneuf rockin and sockin in the playoffs, cause he's gonna have to play like that to get in them"
552706,Rod Caster,2011-02-17 22:06:00,5784,"I have good hopes for the leafs in the stretch. Any team that finds it's stride will play well, doesn't matter which players or gm or coach they have. Look at the pens without Crosby, Malkin, letestu and others...they are still playing well. Washington with tons of great players...not playing so good. It's all about momentum and confidence. Remember the Oilers in 2006 playoffs? Canadians last year in the playoffs? Calgary this year? Confidence baby!"
552748,knightfisher,2011-02-17 23:10:00,237,"Always want to see the laughs do well but usually disappointed, so I don't pay much attention to them anymore. Now Calgary is a team I'm really impressed with. Just hope Cal and Van don't meet in the first round, if Cal can keep up the winning ways."
552776,smally21,2011-02-18 00:01:00,993,a couple of wins = stanley cup!  i love leafs fans and give you all the credit. keep it up!
552786,fish_fishburn,2011-02-18 00:17:00,1311,Craziest stuff I've read today.
552787,Rizzo,2011-02-18 00:18:00,4754,never going to make the playoffs....just please don't give up another high pick. Finishing just out of the playoffs is about the best thing that could happen
552789,solopaddler,2011-02-18 00:20:00,8605, Nobody said anything about a cup.
552794,canadadude,2011-02-18 00:27:00,769,"At the very least Burke is making it interesting,he's always cooking up some moves and has made a ton of cap room. You never know one day he may come up with a winning combination,I gotta hand it to him for trying."
552906,hawk-eye,2011-02-18 07:01:00,141,Im glad that he isnt being stubburn by keeping the guys he signs or trades for. If he keeps movin guys in and out he will gather a group of guys that can compete.
553060,Governator,2011-02-18 18:59:00,879,"Kaberle has been dealt to the Bruins for prospect Joe Colborne (He was a 1st rnder) the Bruins' first round pick in 2011 and a conditional draft pick.  It's not the pick the leafs gave up for Kessel, it's the Bruins pick but still they got a couple of 1st rounders and 2nd rounders now.  I'll miss Kaberle though, he was definitely a dedicated Leaf in and out.  Maybe he'll get resigned in the offseason."
553068,tb4me,2011-02-18 19:40:00,3295,Its a sad day in leaf land..Kabs will be missed..Had to be done thou. Good move Burkie!! Wonder what he has up his sleeve next? Im willing to bet that with over 7 mill in cap space and 2 first rounders there is a BIG deal comming soon..I dont think you will see the leafs resign Kabs in the off season.. thats considered drity work among the GM's.. Burkie would be hung out to dry in future moves as a gm if he did that to Boston..
553071,Governator,2011-02-18 20:10:00,879,  That's true but Boston would have to make a decision how big of a contract they can offer Kabs.  He's not getting any younger and will probably still demand over 4mil/season.
552378,darsky,2011-02-17 02:48:00,586,8 points out-or is it 6 with tonite's win?  Eastern Conference Team 	GP 	Pts 1. 	* Philadelphia 	56 	79 2. 	* Tampa Bay 	57 	74 3. 	* Boston 	57 	69 4.

552386,PikeMolester,2011-02-17 03:06:00,428,k wow relax!
552387,HTHM,2011-02-17 03:06:00,4082,"Well, the world is supposed to end in 2012......."
552389,GBW,2011-02-17 03:12:00,8460,"good game?  yes me walking on soft water?  no till I can do that, the Leafs are not going far; if anywhere."
552398,hawk-eye,2011-02-17 03:19:00,141,By shot do you mean a shot on net?
552401,ADB,2011-02-17 03:20:00,444,"8th place is on pace for 88 points.  Assuming Toronto needs 90 points to get in, they need to go 17-7 over the remaining 24 games.  Not exactly that far fetched."
552406,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2011-02-17 03:24:00,0,"  it is if you look at their record the past 6 years. that said, for the sake of spiting boston, i hope they can be as competitive as possible."
552408,hawk-eye,2011-02-17 03:26:00,141,"17 - 7 sure if you Philly, or Vancover but come on Toronto. Hey dont get me wrong Ill be the first one down there if they do but Ive ssen enough of this team and frankly would be satisfied if they finished the season 7 -17"
552413,solopaddler,2011-02-17 03:40:00,8605,  You and every other fairweather fan of the team.
552415,[email protected],2011-02-17 03:46:00,119,"this IS the time of year they tend to push, so being in a reasonably competitive spot in the standings, another late season surge may get us there..........,,,a guy can dream can't he ??"
552421,hawk-eye,2011-02-17 03:56:00,141,Ive been to the acc when it was raining. We can hope
552423,ADB,2011-02-17 03:59:00,444," The team now is completely independent from any team beyond last year, considering almost all of the players have been changed besides Kaberle.  But thanks for your support"
552424,GBW,2011-02-17 04:02:00,8460,Should I put my seat on Bay or Richmond?
552430,irishfield,2011-02-17 04:08:00,26272,Thought you guys had a corner office Geoff...
552434,splashhopper,2011-02-17 04:19:00,2931, Change the owners... not the players
552436,ADB,2011-02-17 04:26:00,444," Tell me what the problem with the ownership is?  The spend to the cap, they'll pay to send guys to the minors...they hired Burke, which most people felt was the best move at the time.  I don't like the fact that the OTPP has control of the team, but realistically, what else can they do?"
552440,GBW,2011-02-17 04:49:00,8460,"Shhh, we do but it's on the 17th floor so we want to see some stretch pants too.."
552442,[email protected],2011-02-17 05:02:00,119,Love the fact Ottawa is in last too!!!!
552463,craigdritchie,2011-02-17 11:42:00,1586,Leaf fans. Give them a ray of hope and they fall all over themselves. It's kind of like dangling a string in front of a kitten.
552466,solopaddler,2011-02-17 12:08:00,8605," I've been a fan my entire life. Sometimes I'm frustrated with them, but I've never given up on them."
552472,asdve23rveavwa,2011-02-17 12:49:00,2690,"  You betcha!!  That is part of what being a true fan is all about.  I'll knock them as much as the other guy when they deserve it, but, always have been and always will be a Leafs fan.  Can't stand bandwagon jumpers, or, when people switch ""their"" teams, just because they are winning. Will they make the playoffs, still a long shot, but as long as they continue to improve and move in the right direction things are looking up."
552478,skeeter,2011-02-17 13:26:00,1907,Well said Frankie65!!!
552487,ADB,2011-02-17 13:37:00,444,"  It's people like that, who mock Leafs fans, that are very conveniently Detroit or Pittsburgh fans."
