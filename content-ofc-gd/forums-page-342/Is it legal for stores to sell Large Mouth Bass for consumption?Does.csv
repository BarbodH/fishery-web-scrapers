755376,John Bacon,2012-12-31 03:57:00,3277,"Yes, it is legal. It is common for stores to sell farm raised large mouth bass."

755451,kemper,2012-12-31 15:13:00,2232,"Assuming they are farm raised, yes very legal.  There are also lots of fish markets that sell bass that are not farm raised - this probably isn't so legal..."
755537,captpierre,2012-12-31 22:10:00,2521,"You'll find wild crappy, rockbass, perch, whitefish, laketrout and walleye as well.  There is a commercial fishery for all these but the bass are farmed.  Me thinks from the US"
