754094,crappieperchhunter,2012-12-24 03:12:00,2582,That is 100% what I'm talking about. For future reference though...omit the foot pictures  Nice marigolds though
754095,kickingfrog,2012-12-24 03:12:00,8333,"Our Christmas Eve tradition is a punch with vodka. Pineapple juice, orange juice, cranberry juice and a jar of maraschino cherries. Freeze lemon and lime slices with water in muffin tins. If there is some left over it's great Christmas morning if we don't have to drive anywhere after opening presents."

754102,Christopheraaron,2012-12-24 03:29:00,3525,Almost forgot a nice cup of hot cider
754104,BillM,2012-12-24 03:35:00,17367,I usually buy myself a bottle of this every Xmas..  It doesn't last long.  
754108,fish_fishburn,2012-12-24 03:53:00,1311,I like to garnish my ceaser with a pepperette instead of the celery.
754109,craigdritchie,2012-12-24 04:09:00,1586,"Haven't tried Silver Spiced. Regular gold spiced Cap'n Morgan is pretty good stuff though. Will try the Silver type soon.  And yup, need nutmeg in there too!  GF needs to mow her legs and splurge on a pedicure!"
754110,Moosebunk,2012-12-24 04:14:00,3970,White Russians on Christmas Eve especially.
754111,Cookslav,2012-12-24 04:23:00,1457,I'm partial to The Nog and spiced rum...But My brother some times gets the Caesars going. Don't knock it till you try it but I got hooked big time on a spoonfull of spicy horseradish in my Caesars as well....texturally its different but DAM is it good!
754112,Roy,2012-12-24 04:27:00,13728,"I stay with Old Mil'wackie' all year. If there was something that I liked better for Christmas, I'd have it all year."
754113,Dabluz,2012-12-24 04:28:00,701,"  Now....that looks like damned fine whiskey.  I will have to try that.  I really like good whiskey.  However, if I've had a few too many, I like to start up the next morning with a good Apple Jack (whiskey and apple juice).  You can use cheaper whiskey for the Apple Jack."
754117,crappieperchhunter,2012-12-24 04:41:00,2582, IMHO....It's not about liking it better at xmas Roy..it's about something different to celebrate the season.  I only eat shortbread cookies this time of the year too and my sister makes the best. But i would never think of having them in July.
754124,adolson,2012-12-24 05:08:00,783,"Coffee. Freshly-roasted in my basement, brewed either as an espresso or as a regular cup of black coffee via an AeroPress.  This is my every-day drink, as well as my Christmas drink."
754126,Ben_Daniels,2012-12-24 06:03:00,435,"Having been a bartender for the better part of a decade, it seems like my work experience might actually be relevant on OFC for once, lol!  No need to use a high quality vodka like Grey Goose when making a Ceasar... mixing vodka with Clamato, Worcestershire, tobacco, salt, pepper etc you wont notice the quality of the vodka at all. If you plan to drink a lot then you will have less of a hangover with high quality booze but the taste will not change much. I see a Ceasar as an aperitif/appetizer...load it up with some bacon, a spicy bean, a shrimp, celery or anything else! Ive even seen them with a full slider burger as a garnish.   Granville Island has some great beer!   I love eggnog and rum but only one or two...the nog doesn't seems to sit well in my stomach after a few drinks. Sailor Jerry is great rum as well!  My current favorite Christmas drink is Wiser's spiced whiskey or lambs black sheep rum with apple cider, a little lemon juice and some Cinnamon simple syrup(just boil some sugar, water and cinnamon sticks until it is syrupy) garnished with a cinnamon stick which is great for stirring the drink."
754129,Skipper D,2012-12-24 08:48:00,1970,I like one of every thing but i'll always take two of the run & egg nog .
754130,wormdunker,2012-12-24 09:02:00,1711,"Lottsa good drink suggestions.  Thanx for reminding me about rum & eggnog.  Used to be quite a tradition while still living at home with my parents & 2 brothers.  Gonna have to try the dill pickle as a garnish for my caesar(s) tonight! Merry Christmas to all!  Wishing you & your family a safe, happy & healthy holiday."

754155,grimsbylander,2012-12-24 14:15:00,3016,"It's a three stage process: Morning - baileys and coffee Mid-day - Glenfiddich or Forty Creek on ice. Evening - El Dorado rum - neat, with a Guiness or Kilkennys! That's a holly jolly Christmas!!"
754160,Jigger,2012-12-24 14:19:00,1237,Coffee with some type of Creme is a holiday staple. Right now its 40Creek but Carolans or Baileys hit the spot just as well. Works good with egg nog too.  Good call on the Granville Island Winter Ale. Got some about a week ago. Very flavourful!
754219,kickingfrog,2012-12-24 18:51:00,8333,FYI from statscan:  5.7 million litres — The volume of commercial sales of eggnog in Canada in December 2011. More than 2 million litres were sold the previous month (November 2011). Virtually all eggnog sales are in November and December.  Statscan has a bunch of Christmas stats. Some of the numbers are surprising (to me at least) for a country of 30 odd million people. http://www42.statcan.gc.ca/smr08/2012/smr08_170_2012-eng.htm?WT.mc_id=twtZ0691
754056,wormdunker,2012-12-24 00:08:00,1711,"Down south due to the lack of ice (no fishing) & really close to Christmas I decided to share the recipe for my favourite Christmas drink.  Caesars!! 1 glass 8 oz rim this glass with the juice from a slice of lime then roll the glass in clamato rimmer to have an even coating of rimmer around the circumference of the glass pour in 1 1/2 oz vodka - preferably ""Grey Goose"" Add approximately 1/2 cup of regular Clamato juice Add 3 medium sized ice cubes After adding the ice add 3 drops of tobasco sauce then add 4 drops of worcestershire sauce Add 1 olive -the type stuffed with a garlic clove Stir this mixture sprinkle black pepper on top of the liquids add a celery stalk for appearance OR 1 of Matt & Steves ""extreme beans"" ENJOY  What is your favourite Christmas drink?"
754058,Woodsman,2012-12-24 00:24:00,1286,Beer. And that's year around.

754060,Rod Caster,2012-12-24 00:31:00,5784,"I've been drinking Granville Island Winter Ale... it's a hearty beer with lots of flavour, and seems fitting for the season.  Tradition at the Caster house is hot apple cider with cinnamon sticks"

754066,Live2fish85,2012-12-24 01:01:00,1633,Ice cold Blue. That's all my grandpa and I drink lol. My parents drink that lite now haha.
754067,fishindevil,2012-12-24 01:05:00,6254,Crown & ginger !!! And of course my own Caesars but I use marinated celery cut groves in celery and lay flat in a Tupperware container and pour in 2oz of vodka and marinate !!!!! Awesome
754069,craigdritchie,2012-12-24 01:11:00,1586,Fav Christmas drink would be eggnog with a good splash of spiced rum in it. You can drink beer any time. Rum and eggnog comes only during the holidays.

I practice the night before, making B52's, take about 8 of em to get it perfected. We have the family come to our house Christmas morning where we watch our all growed up now kids, open their presents. afterwards, I make everyone breakfast to their order. Anything from strawberry, blueberry or peach crepes to omelets to eggs Benedict. Along with breakfast though, is B52's. They go great with a coffee chaser!"
754080,crappieperchhunter,2012-12-24 02:29:00,2582," X4. Craig  have you tried the Silver spiced Captain Morgans. I have not., but I know many travelers who are very happy it is available in Canada now. I will wait to try it with my homegrown mint in  Mojitos in the summer at the cottage.  As far as the rum and eggnog goes...don't ever forget the nutmeg either"
754081,crappieperchhunter,2012-12-24 02:37:00,2582, Wormdunker if you love Ceasar's I have a suggestion for a garish that is way better then the standard celery stalk.  Get a good dill pickle...vlasic's Zesty dill is my fav and slice it length wise almost all the way through...wooden cloth pin effect...and stick that mother over the edge of your rimmed glass. Now THAT is a Ceasar garnish.
754083,kickingfrog,2012-12-24 02:47:00,8333," I use a home made peppered vodka for my wife's Caesars. Just add some slightly crushed pepper corns to vodka and let it sit for a week, swirl the bottle a few times during the week. Strain the vodka through cheese cloth and use. BTW does not taste good in screwdrivers."
754085,i2cool2fool,2012-12-24 02:55:00,349,"All great suggestions. I am about to have another Appleton and Eggnog.  Tomorrow night will be filled with phone calls, Skype and other to family in the east coast along with an assortment of single malts.  Merry Christmas everyone. Stay safe and don't get run over by reindeer."
754087,bigugli,2012-12-24 02:58:00,6138,"Extra thick with a good dash of nutmeg.  Of course there is the love affair with traditional nordic brandies like Peder Heering, Lapponia, and the odd splash of Aqvavit"
754089,irishfield,2012-12-24 03:03:00,26272,"I can tell you up front and personal... if you ever drove a milk truck, you'd never drink Eggnog!  El Dorado Silver Deluxe and diet Pepsi for me... Thank God no local LCBO store stocks the stuff or the bottle wouldn't last as long!"
754090,Blue Lk,2012-12-24 03:04:00,337, Like this?   Also my fav in the summer
