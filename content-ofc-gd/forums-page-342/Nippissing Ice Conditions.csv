753852,Jer_H,2012-12-22 13:57:00,25,"Hi all,  Just wondering if there are any members local to the lake who can give an update on the ice situation up there.  I have a bungalow booked for Jan 3rd in the South Shore area  Thanks in advance!"
753855,Rod Caster,2012-12-22 14:08:00,5784,Some of the outfitters are predicting that ice will be good for Jan 1st. Weather forecast seems to concur with them.
753952,kuhaman,2012-12-23 01:05:00,503,Just remember the regs have changed. You can only keep 1 wally and it has to be between 4 and 7 inches!
753953,kickingfrog,2012-12-23 01:18:00,8333, But they are tender at that size. 
753955,kuhaman,2012-12-23 01:46:00,503,
753962,Nipfisher,2012-12-23 03:14:00,2449,  Pfffffff. Rod Caster can catch them smaller than that.     If you hold it closer it looks bigger right? Nope.  
753994,Headhunter,2012-12-23 15:32:00,5703,"At the rate things are going, I fully expect the first Pickereye I pull up through the ice to explode! HH"
755325,Nipfisher,2012-12-31 00:44:00,2449,"Lots of huts out on Callander Bay today. Sleds and quads had no issues. Mine is going out tomorrow morning. My buddies measured 9"" of good solid ice in front of where the light house was."
755340,kickingfrog,2012-12-31 01:03:00,8333,Where did the lighthouse go?
755356,Nipfisher,2012-12-31 01:52:00,2449,  The lighthouse in Callander Bay blew down in a huge winter storm about 8 years ago. Just the platform (decking) remains.
755614,Nipfisher,2013-01-01 05:52:00,2449,"Pulled the hut out onto 7"" of good solid ice today with the help of JoeyTier. My 1993 Skandic 503 was put to the test as there was alot of slush. Pulling a heavy shack in the slush does not make for good steering lol. Opening day report to follow tomorrow."
