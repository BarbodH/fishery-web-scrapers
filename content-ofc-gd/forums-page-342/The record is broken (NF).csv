754643,Roy,2012-12-27 20:00:00,13728,The 1969 snowfall record has been broken by 3cms. It will continue to snow heavily 'til 7 or 8PM with heavy winds. Current winds are NNE at 46kph gusting to 59kph. Highways are closed everywhere. At least J and I are home with a fire happening and we're just starting to make a really nice supper. I won't even bother to start up Big Bertha to clean the driveway....the wind and snow are just overwhelming for the time being. I'll take pics here as soon as I have the chance.  Hope everyone is safe and comfortable.

Stay safe and enjoy the down time.
754660,lew,2012-12-27 20:47:00,12766,"Sounds like your getting hammered over your way Roy, but good to hear you guys are surviving intact. Nice being retired eh, and not having to drive around town in all that mess.  We got about 5"" here but it still took me a couple hours to clean everything up but that's OK, as I enjoy doing that kinda stuff."
754664,crappieperchhunter,2012-12-27 21:07:00,2582,4-5 inches here in Oshawa. That's enough for me. Relax around the fire Roy and wait for Wiarton Willie to tell you it's safe to come out.
