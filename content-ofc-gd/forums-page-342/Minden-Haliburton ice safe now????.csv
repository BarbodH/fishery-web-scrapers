I just wanted to check on this site first though to see if anyone here has ice fished that area and can confirm that there is safe ice there, before I drive 3 hours to fish:) Thanks for the help guys! Gonna walleye or laker fish I guess. Landry"
755021,Christopheraaron,2012-12-29 20:04:00,3525,Sounds safe to me. As soon as I get a float suit that's my first destination. Good luck!
755084,jedimaster,2012-12-30 00:33:00,3472,If you are going out make sure you have fully waterproof footwear. The ice is still not solid so it leaks lots through the holes. We had about 3-4 inches of water and slush on top by the end of the day.
