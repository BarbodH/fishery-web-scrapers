And then possible charges passed forward, it's not the SAR team to make that decision I don't think (pretty sure they are largely gov't funded), they just analyze the situation and then it's the private entities that assisted in the rescue that look to recover costs  Are they properly prepared? Trained and experience for what they're doing to determine risk analysis? Have the tools and equipment to do what they're doing? etc, etc  I think 90% of rescues are simply accidents and should not be billed, but then there is the other 10%...but who and how you draw the line there, that's tough  I worked at a heli ski lodge and when we responded to mayday's to back country sledders, stopped our ski program and left clients on the mountain to respond, we sent an invoice every time for pilot and guides wages and fuel  I've had the opportunity to work with and chat with many SAR volunteers, none of them ever say they are angry to come to the rescue, it's what they live for and are happy to help....but plenty frustrated over the many darwin idiots out there...and it's very sad when a rescue turns to a recovery all too often  it cost this guy 10K but he stood up and handled it well, cudos to him  http://vancouver.24hrs.ca/2012/12/19/snowboarder-sorry-for-endangering-others-faces-bill-from-ski-hill  warm temperatures in march and high winds? regardless of an OPP advisory or not, those conditions should make you reconsider, especially on a large lake...and some guys got caught out there twice??!!!  nothing to complain about for a $200 tab, especially if they can make it up with volunteer hours"
754948,Rich,2012-12-29 13:59:00,3927,Yeah i've never seen people asking the victims of avalanches to pay for rescue services.
754950,Rustic-Fisher,2012-12-29 14:48:00,826,"We all know there is no such thing as safe ice, ESPECIALLY on that lake when there are open sections. Municipal /provincial authorities will seldom give a complete thumbs up for activities where public judgement vs risk to public is to high.  Liability is just to great. Should you pay if a rescue is warranted ?  I don't think so,  you pay taxes and part of those taxes involve emergency services no matter how stupid you are. BUT if your pulled from that lake a second time, your on the hook for something, and thats what the courts are for. Those rescuers did a great job in such adverse conditions, though you may not notice there was a few extremely dicey moments where the rescuers could of turned into victims as well . Though paid to preform technical rescues such as what unfolded that day the bottom line is a few fish aren't worth a few funerals  as the fee you could end up paying is your life or someone else's .  Unbelievably a few of the people rescued thought the emergency services life jackets (400$ a pop) were theirs to keep and slithered of with them.  Hopefully we get a good freeze this year, Stay safe R"

754961,chris f.,2012-12-29 15:44:00,95,"Four fishermen were rescued from an ice flow just off Massassauga Point last year on Quinte. The fishermen got caught on a huge sheet of ice that broke off from the east side of the narrows. All four fishermen were floated across to shore on banana boats. The expected bill for rescue was $10,000. Now i don't know if thats each or split between the 4 of them, but i think that along with the safety of your life would be enough of a hint to stay off punky ice"
754962,Terry,2012-12-29 16:02:00,14456," so if you get in a car accident when road conditions are bad, you expect to get a bill for being rescued? i think that along with the safety of your life would be enough of a hint to stay off bad roads.....  I have no problem with paying for rescue as long as every person pays for every situation not just fishermen you just gave approval for fees for being a fisherman and I think that is wrong"
754971,chris f.,2012-12-29 16:44:00,95,"i guess i should clarify my stance on this lol.. i believe that being rescued from car wrecks are a bit of a stretch from being rescued on frozen water or lack there of... i was actually in an accident christmas morning. an on coming car was crowding the middle of a slushy country road and forced me off the road into a ditch where the car flipped twice, landing on its roof. should i have stayed home because the roads were a bit slushy? where was my rescue.. i had to get my wife and 10 month old child out on my own.. should i get tax $$ back because it took the opp and ems 45 mins to get there because it was chrismas morning? or because 911 didn't tell them that the car was flipped? if you venture out onto thin ice it is YOUR fault if you have to be rescued and i think that should be an individual penalty. thanks for you input though, as it confirms my thought process that some people only care about themselves and what THEY think is best for everyone. i agree that certain services are a right of EVEYBODY, but what about those people that have never in their life been fishing or out on the ice? I love to snowboard, but i would never go on some mountain with an avalanche warning.. never on the ice when there are warnings.. it's a personal judgement call for vet's of the hard water to head out. so i guess in closing i would just like to say be safe in whatever outdoor winter activity you like to take part in "

754973,Rustic-Fisher,2012-12-29 16:48:00,826,"Yep, you'll be billed for an car accident in some municipalities if your a non resident. Your insurance will cover it.

754975,chris f.,2012-12-29 16:54:00,95," lol.. and i think that would fix this issue.. insurance companies should offer a fisherman policy lol... if you want to go out on the ice and fish, buy an insurance policy for it because if i weren't a fisherman, i would be livid if my tax dollars went to some band of suicidal ice fishermen had to be rescued.. but if it were me i would have no prob. paying the fine, provided no one else had to pay for my stupidity."

754979,Terry,2012-12-29 17:04:00,14456, so you have the right to go out on dangerous roads and be rescued but not fisherman because you only care about yourself.........and again they do tell people the roads are bad and you ignored it ...the fisherman ignored it too ..by the way more firemen have been killed on the road rescuing people then by rescuing fishermen.............   but back to my only real argument if a fisherman has to pay then you do too
754981,chris f.,2012-12-29 17:19:00,95," lol... did you even take some time to read my post terry? i was NOT rescued. OPP and EMS didn't show up for 45+ minutes. And who told me that there was slush on the shoulders of the road? no one... i ignored...? what warnings? so i guess i should not go anywhere for christmas because there is 4 inches of slush on the shoulder of the road.. even the OPP reported that it was not a weather related accident. and what about the driver that forced me off the road terry? you saying that he had the right to go out on christmas morning and almost kill 3 people, or did i ignore that too? so what is your point terry? i'm saying if you put yourself in danger (being on thin ice) you suffer the consequence.. and the fines. whats your say on that terry?  and for the record.. every driver puts his/her lives at risk every time you leave the driveway... weather is not an excuse for people who shouldn't be driving in the first place.. fisherman/woman or not and we have INSURANCE for that"

754987,Terry,2012-12-29 17:28:00,14456,"my point was, you expected free service.... why wouldn't fishermen  and as for the avalanche warning.....if you when to see about the avalanche and saw there was no chance of an avalanche and a 1000 people were skiing would you ski and if every day they still warned about an avalanche, would you start ti ignore the sill people crying wolf.....  and as in the fable....crying wolf bit someone in the butt"

754994,chris f.,2012-12-29 17:54:00,95," i expected to be dead along with my family terry.. if we HAD been injured and needed to use the service of an ambulance, i would, and have gladly paid for it in the past. this is exactly my point. you are missing the fact that accident's are one thing all together as far as the service's we require. no one gets in the car in the morning and thinks.. "" ok, im gonna get cut off again on my way to work today, but this time im gonna flip my car 5 times and end up squished, not able to get out."" do you get billed for that? or me.. i think if there is a bill it comes to me. the same goes for if i get up in the morning and say "" im goin' ice fishing "" and the ice pack breaks up and i float away. they come to save me.. i gladly pay the price to be alive. i never said that I expected anything for free. the point is that daily, we do dangerous things out of necessity ( drive, work ect ) and things for pleasure ( ie. fishing, snowboarding ect ) if you do things that are dangerous and require others to put their lives at risk to save you, you are the sole person at fault.. not me or anyone else.  that being said, yes i agree that everyone should be paying the same for the SAME services. if i get lost on a mountain, and terry got stuck out fishing we both should pay the appropriate fees associated to the rescue .. thats been my point from the beginning of this wonderful and jolly thread lol  Merry HoHoHo and Happy New Year... Bay of Quinte for the win"
755004,Oggie,2012-12-29 19:38:00,588,So if you're in a car accident and you are convicted of an offense then you're at faulty.  Do you get the bill for the rescue service that were needed to assit you? Don't think so!  I would much rather see the courts determine who is at fault. They should have charged the ice fishermen that required rescue and then upon conviction have them pay for some of the rescue costs. Terry is right this is the Local Council's vendetta against ice fishermen! They really don't want ice fishing or any of the hassles that result )eg. parking). Dan O.
755044,lew,2012-12-29 21:07:00,12766,"Before retiring 13 years ago, I spent 32 years as a fireman in Toronto and a BIG part of the job is helping people who got themselves into serious trouble through misfortune, carelessness, accident or just plain stupidness.  We'd assess the situation, figure out the best way to fix it and then do it.  Never once in all my years on the job did I ever hear any other fireman, copper or paramedic say that a person should be fined for getting himself into trouble.....it's our job to go out and help them, that's why we're there and it's what we're payed to do.  Emergency workers are on the job 24/7 and their job is to help people when the call comes in, not to judge them. Doesn't matter if they get trapped in a burning house, injured in a car crash or get stuck on an ice flow in Lake Simcoe.  If an emergency worker sits in the station all day and doesn't respond to any  calls, he gets paid exactly the same amount of money as if he'd responded to a dozen calls.  It always makes me wonder where they come up with figures like posted in this story, where it cost Oro-Medonty (SP) $4300 to rescue those guys when the only extra expense I can see is the extra fuel for the trucks while they sit idleing on the shore.  Personally, I think it's disgusting that these guys were fined because they got themselves into trouble and had to be rescued.  But that's just the opinion of someone who was payed to help folks.  And for what it's worth, I agree with EVERYTHING that Terry said."
755049,chris f.,2012-12-29 21:53:00,95," im glad to see that you agree with everything terry said. those figures can be found on a number of local news sites, and i was arguing the same point til i was told it was my fault for going out in my car when there was slush on the roads. im also glad to know its my fault some other driver thought he had rights to the whole road. oh, and how its my fault that they just kept on driving even though they just caused a car to roll into the ditch with a 10 month old child in it. so because i apparently ignored some warning from no one that a car was going to run me off the i should have to pay for a rescue that never came..? thats what terry's telling me so if you want to agree with him fine, but at least read the rest of the posts so you have your facts straight. all i did was comment on the bay of quinte rescue last year and terry felt obligated to tell me that i did something wrong by driving and that i expect free rescue when something goes bad. not the case and i have said that in my previous posts. as for the MAIN issue in question here ( again ).. i agree that people have a right to assistance when in danger, but if that danger is self inflicted then you pay the price... tell me that a fire crew or ems team has ever made a family pay for rescue from a single car roll over... please.. and thats my opinion"
755055,Terry,2012-12-29 22:09:00,14456,I am sorry but your sad story had nothing or little to do with was being discussed IMO the details did nothing so I ignored that and hit what I thought was part of the discussion ....I tend to glaze over on unnecessary facts ...

754655,Oggie,2012-12-27 20:36:00,588,I lost track of the final outcome. Did the guys on Simcoe that required rescue last winter get fined?  I've heard so many versions and amounts I'm just curious.

Sheesh, i would think whether or not your life is at risk would be more the concern when on thin ice.  Why would you even contemplate walking on ""Iffy Ice"" ???"
754686,BucktownAngler,2012-12-27 22:22:00,582, was thinking the same thing
754687,mike rousseau,2012-12-27 22:27:00,4661,  Yup....  Not a wise way to go about ice safety....  I use judgment every day I'm on the ice.... Ill even spud my way out a mile even when I see others out there.... Unless I know its safe I check for myself... And if I'm wrong and need emergency support.... Ill deal with the consaquences laid out before me... Better then the alternative... A Rousseau Popsicle......

I have a major problem with my tax dollars being used to save people who are so obviously and incredibly stupid.  It isn't cost alone - they put their rescuers at risk too. Pretty selfish behaviour, if you ask me. Why anyone would knowingly head out on iffy ice is beyond me."
754705,Oggie,2012-12-28 00:23:00,588,"I guess I see your points about iffy ice. I should select my words more carefully.  I'm not a thrill seeker and I don't take any chances. I spud and all that stuff. I'm one of the last guys on the ice not one of the first. Having said that crap happens!  On one occasion last year, I was out on Cooks Bay and with over a foot of black ice so I felt quite safe. Then the wind direction changed from Northwest to Southeast in a very short period of time. The main lake wasn't frozen so I headed for shore (knowing the ice would likely break free) and yup there was about 15' of newly opened water as the ice broke away.  I walked the edge for over a km until I could find a reasonable way off.  So if a rescue is required I am liable???  I know, I know.....never go one the ice until it's completely safe. Funny.... it's always guys that don't ice fish much that offer up that kind of advice. Stay off the banks of swollen river during the spring .... anybody a steelheader here???? How many guys are on those streams during spring runoff! I know I am.  And yeah a $2200 bill would make me head for shore alot quicker.  They're passing along the cost as a message and a deterrent to ice fishers.  Dan O."
754781,BillM,2012-12-28 17:03:00,17367,"definitely happens, but like Craig mentioned the guys that got stuck twice should be paying heft hefty fines, that's just Darwinism at work if you ask me.  Also, why are you fishing rivers when they are blown out and chocolate milk in the spring?  LOL"

754828,BucktownAngler,2012-12-28 19:55:00,582,"   Google is your friend...i just copied and pasted the thread title into google. its the 3rd link.       Anglers rescued from Lake Simcoe ice floe ordered to pay $200 each  Published on Wednesday March 28, 2012  The Township of Oro-Medonte will require the 26 fishermen who became stranded on an ice floe on Lake Simcoe earlier this month to pay back some of the costs for the rescue.  Council made the decision late Wednesday night, after receiving a report and recommendation from the local fire department.  “The fire people concluded that there was not evidence of good judgment being used by the fishermen when they went out on the ice,” said Harry Hughes, mayor of Oro-Medonte. “So our final recommendation was that the township should seek to recover costs,” he said. “The total cost would come out to about $200 per person rescued.”  On March 9, the men became stranded on Lake Simcoe after a dramatic change in wind direction forced the ice where dozens were fishing to suddenly crack away from shore. There had been warnings posted days earlier by the Ontario Provincial Police to stay off the ice due to unseasonably warm weather.  The township adopted a fees and charges bylaw two years ago to deter people from taking unnecessary risks on the lake, but it had never been enforced. Fines include $200 an hour for the air boat, and $100 an hour per staff member. More than 20 people were needed to bring the anglers to safety and the boat was used for about four hours.  Oro-Medonte calculated its costs alone as $4,875. The figure does not include the costs of other municipalities or the OPP.  The four-hour ordeal involved Oro-Medonte firefighters, an OPP helicopter and officers from Barrie. Three other municipalities and a military team from Trenton were on standby. The OPP said they would not fine the men.  Some of the fishermen, who attended the council meeting, said they would organize a slo-pitch softball tournament to help recover some of the costs.  “The costs can be recovered through revenues generated through community services and if that doesn't occur, then we will be taking efforts to deal with those individuals who don't contribute,” said Hughes.  The evening also gave the anglers a chance to thank some of the firefighters and OPP officers who helped rescue them, he said.  http://www.thestar.com/news/gta/article/1153484--anglers-rescued-from-lake-simcoe-ice-floe-ordered-to-pay-200-each"

754885,Garnet,2012-12-29 01:07:00,2056,"Why are we fishing river when chocolate. Same reason nobody listen to OPP when they say stay off ice.  They never say the ice is safe because nobody at the OPP knows if the ice is safe.  Ever time we get rain the conservation authority issue standard statement ""banks slippery,water high rivers unsafe"".  They never say river safe you can go fishing because nobody at the conservation authority knows if the river are safe.  So nobody listens to idiot statements we go down look and decide."

At the risk of starting another hijacking, the fine sounds fair and I agree with Craig.  Mistakes happen but when people don't take reasonable precautions then a fine is fair IMO.

754892,irishfield,2012-12-29 01:52:00,26272,"Well said Terry...  ..and those complaining about their tax dollars being used for the helicopter. I'm glad to see the $5000/hr we put into the OPP egg beater put to a good use, instead of just milling around Simcoe County burning fuel and putting hours in the pilots logs. The crew is on every day... it's usually in the air every day.. and there was no additional cost for it's use on said day to go save a few lives!  ..and by the way, that approximate $5k/hour for each helicopter (fuel/maintenance/crew/etc) doesn't even start to put a dent in the depreciaton or acquisiton costs at 6.25 MILLION dollars each."
754899,BucktownAngler,2012-12-29 02:45:00,582,  hmmm...not when there was a warning to stay off the ice due to unsafe condtions. and those people chose to ignore the warnings.  fair?
754901,Terry,2012-12-29 02:52:00,14456,"they made the same warnings almost every single day of last winter and every other winter  again they made the same warning every single day last winter...so one day out of 60 they were right  you can't cry wolf every day the say I told you so the one day of the year it comes true   and icefishing happens to be one of the safest winter sports in canada.....  so when they say don't go on roads if you don't have to..you should have to pay for rescue and I guess your insurance should not pay for your damage, cause you were warned...sorry you statement doesn't hold water....."

754908,BucktownAngler,2012-12-29 03:25:00,582," i dont recall seeing any warnings until late in the season before these guys got stranded. and at that time it was justified (warm temps, high winds)  one of the guys who was rescued had been rescued 2 times previously. you cant fix stupid i guess  your statement doesnt hold water bud."
754919,Hoppy,2012-12-29 04:52:00,95," The boy who cried wolf thing is very true. I live here on the west side of Simcoe and according to the multiple police forces and therefore the local media there is never safe ice. On the local tv station OPP, South Simcoe and Barrie officers push the idea there is no such thing as safe ice. I have never heard a positive ice report from the authorities in the forty years I've been ice fishing here. Sure you hear ""lots of good ice from hut operator's"" or the OFSC trail across the lake from them which is a good sign. But even they say the only safe option on the lake is on they marked trail. The most positive the media center ever gets is to check with the local hut operators when pressured by the same, this issue drives them nuts too.  So if you don't go when there are warnings then you don't fish!"
754927,Terry,2012-12-29 11:17:00,14456," I live in the area and I did hear warnings from fire/ police and the local tv station every single day last winter the fact that you did not hear/see all the warnings all winter long gives those guys an out..maybe they did not hear the warnings, after all you missed them all winter long and sure the guys that got rescued twice b are stupid and that was mother nature tiring to remove them from the gene pool..  but you are still wrong, there were so many warnings all winter long, it was like a nagging wife........... and to not loose sight... the point is ...if fishermen have to pay..then all rescues should pay.....damn fishermen are becoming a cash cow for townships theses days and you guys are playing right into they hands..  hey anglers park here...answer lets charge for parking for vehicles with trailers...a park with a ramp..lets charge for launching (no one else gets charged for using the park) guys are fishing the river answer lets make the buy an Essa fishing license to access the river ( anyone else can access use the river free but have a rod and you pay) a guy can bring their kids and dog and the can play in the river throw sticks in the river(so you can fish) and they don't pay but you with the rod pays    yeah guys continue to agree that fishermen have to pay for services that everyone else gets for free  but don't complain when more and more fishing things become pay to play...go ahead and support the wrong side  or at lest think about it before you talk/type   and it is surprising that more guys are not stepping up and agreeing with me ..it is not about if the guys were stupid, it's should we pay when no other group does.. people debating this issue will find this thread on google and you guys are stating it is fine to make fishermen pay for everything....."
754935,soobnoob,2012-12-29 13:05:00,55,Food for thought...Isn't this more or less like taking a ride in an ambulance? Which you have to pay for!!   Should ohip stop covering idiots?  So when they calculated cost/staff... Weren't those staff being paid their salaries anyways? Do firefighters get paid extra when they do their job?
754940,Terry,2012-12-29 13:23:00,14456,"as long as everyone has to pay equally for services, I have no problem with them paying......but this was a fine the township imposed and do they do that for every rescue everywhere...no, this is a fishermen tax..get used to it"
754946,johnnyb,2012-12-29 13:46:00,3413,Terry is right on the button.
