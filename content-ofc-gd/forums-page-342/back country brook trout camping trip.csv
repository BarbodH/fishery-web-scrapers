Google hasn't helped me find anything more than a thermal fishing popup. Something like the pop ups mountain climbers use maybe.. ? i set up my 4 person tent today in the yard and it sure won't do. lol... any thoughts or links would be appreciated."

755367,DRIFTER_016,2012-12-31 03:14:00,10439,I have been using a Eureka expedition tent for nearly 10 years now and I have nothing but good things to say about it and the service offered by the company.  My tent is an Alpenlite 2XT which is rated as a 2 man but would be tight for 2 full grown people. It's perfect for my dog and I though. I have used this tent from Ontario to The NWT to Alaska in all seasons and have been very happy with it's performance. I have even used it in Yellowknife in January!!!!!!!    If I needed a 4 season tent for 2 people I would have no hesitation buying thier K-2 XT model.   Another very good winter tent is The Arctic Oven. A lot of people I know in Alaska swear by them.
755389,chris f.,2012-12-31 06:16:00,95,great info... thank you guys  i'm looking forward to the weekend in the bush and the tent you have is perfect. thanks again

755447,chris f.,2012-12-31 15:04:00,95," if we can figure out a way to ship it, i'll take it. pm me or something, i'm new on the forum and still trying to figure out ho to post pics and other stuff lol"
755490,bare foot wader,2012-12-31 17:50:00,1354,"those are great tents and good price on the classifieds  I've seen some arcitc oven tents and they're great but HEAVY...would never put a 30 lb tent on my pack and snowshoe in anywhere, but for a sled trip or short hike they seem like they'd be worth the money  FYI greyhound shipping is cheap and reliable, especially for heavy/bulky stuff...not sure how it would compare price wise to Canada Post for something as light as a tent...something to consider maybe"
