755174,Oggie,2012-12-30 05:02:00,588,Cabelas Canada or Cabelas USA? thanks for the heads up.  Dan O.
755175,mike rousseau,2012-12-30 05:06:00,4661,USA....
755178,DRIFTER_016,2012-12-30 05:42:00,10439,"Yeah, I got over $200 worth of goodies for under $100."

755210,jim,2012-12-30 14:46:00,124," We can't get free shipping from Cabelas.  Evidently , they have to swim the stuff accross the lake, and that 's really expensive!"
755213,Billy Bob,2012-12-30 15:00:00,5865," Oh yea, that right....if it was a colder winter shipping would be reasonable as they could just drive across Lake Erie..."

755241,mike rousseau,2012-12-30 18:08:00,4661, Never had brokerage fees with cabelas.... Just tax and duty.... If shipped to Canada....  But I'm on the NY state border... So I send my orders to a shipping company  in NY and go pick it up when I get gas... And depending how much the order is customs usually doesn't bother with duty and tax.... So I end up paying 0% HST tax... 0% NY state tax and no duty on most merchandise that I order....
755243,ch312,2012-12-30 18:44:00,1590," 90% of the stuff we buy online is from the US and it's always been cheapest to have the sellers ship via USPS. UPS has to be the worst for charging brokerage and other silly fees. the worst for me from them was a $28 brokerage fee for a ""free"" replacement game call with a value of $0.01 and specifically labeled warranty replacement or something along those lines. some shippers will say they won't ship USPS, but we've convinced more than a few to help us out and do it anyways  it usually works out to at least 25% cheaper than buying in canada after shipping.   to save even more money, use a service such as Kinek so you can take advantage of FREE shipping within the US which many retailers offer. you signup online for free and then select the closest participating place that accepts and holds packages for $5 each. the retailer then ships to this place (the one i use happens to be a storage locker place) for free and they hold the packages for a month allowing you time for multiple shipments to arrive. then simply drive down and pickup all your goodies. the money we save on the shipping costs alone is worth the drive for us.  don't forget to buy some cheap booze on the way back like we did one time!"
755266,DRIFTER_016,2012-12-30 21:39:00,10439, I remembered to pick up some on my latest trip to the US. Look!!! It's a rumpamid!!!!!
