755395,woodro,2012-12-31 08:33:00,168,Very cool! Never heard off that type of fish before. Wonder how much a trip like that would cost.
755397,ChrisK,2012-12-31 10:45:00,2772,Very cool. I imagine the method of getting these fish could be improved somewhat like using heavier gear to control the fish better. Maybe take them under a float and level wind with muskie sized or heavier type rod. Sure its a wonderful idea to take one of these fish with a fly rod but the fly rods just seem like they are under powered for this application ???  Its an amazing video and the potential of unlocking this fishery looks like it could become a reality if the fish could be protected in the end. I hope they pull it together.
