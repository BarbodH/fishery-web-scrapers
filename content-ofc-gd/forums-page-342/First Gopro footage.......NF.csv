755635,Christopheraaron,2013-01-01 13:49:00,3525,Nice! The video was great quality. Don't know what's with the sound
755645,Handlebarz,2013-01-01 14:59:00,3790,Even if the waterproof housing was on there would be some sound. Nice video wish I still had a sled and lived in a area that I could use it

755653,fishindevil,2013-01-01 15:56:00,6254,In my gopro I use it with the soundproof door and have it mounted on my helmet ad you can hear the sound of my snowmobile noooo problem Simon for best setting I use the 960p by 30 and mine is HD as well !!! If you put the door with the holes in it on make sure you don't get snow dust in it as it will fog it up and get it wet check my vids at vectordevil on YouTube I have lots of my gopro footage there I can also mount mine on the front of my sled too its amazing !!! Have fun with the gopro it's awesome thanks for sharing simon
