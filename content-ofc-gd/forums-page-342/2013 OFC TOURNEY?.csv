755166,Joey,2012-12-30 04:03:00,9122," I selected members as they signed up, so 1st person, team 1, second, team 2...... rinse repeat   No stacking involved.  I agree, alot of people sign up, then don't submit any fish for the year.  An individual tourney, in my opinion and experience, would be alot of work.  Something I don't think I'd be interested in running.  Alot of the entries I received were not hosted properly and I had to save to my computer then host them myself on my Flickr account.  I just finished deleting a whole bunch of pics from my flickr account and computer last week from the tourney.  Alot of things get forgotten in the entries to me aswell (lake, date etc.) and have to be followed up on.   Hosting and posting and keeping track takes quite awhile and has to be done accurately.  If it is individual, I'm afraid I don't think I'd be interested, but teams like usual, I'm in!"
755169,Christopheraaron,2012-12-30 04:19:00,3525," As I said, if we want to try both I'll run the individuals."
755170,mike rousseau,2012-12-30 04:19:00,4661,...
755038,misfish,2012-12-29 20:44:00,29133,"I like the pressure of being relied on  . Hell,I would of never heard the end of it,if I hadnt caught that whitie. Right me brudder.  Joey did a great job,and Im sure it took alot of time and effort.  Again,I would like to thank her for her great donation of time to OFC 2012 tourney."
755039,Roy,2012-12-29 20:46:00,13728,Teams got stacked Brian?
755040,misfish,2012-12-29 20:49:00,29133," You never played pick up, stick hockey Roy? LOL  There were no stacked teams.  Luck of the toss. oh,I spelt it right this time.LOL"
755043,SlowPoke,2012-12-29 21:06:00,2984,"I'm not sure how Joey selected teams but I can assure you there was no stacking when I was running it. Teams were picked through a random number generator. Some members requested certain teams and they were denied. Received some attitude about it too... lame. The fact is; 10-12 members per team, you're lucky to get 3 active participants per team. The ""stacked"" teams may have 4 or 5 active participants. Team Captains can play a role in motivating team members but some players won't give it a second thought after signing up.  Individual Tourny? Sounds great but I can predict the outcome. 100+ will join; 15 will be active, 5 will be competitive and Simon will win Perhaps organize a Facebook tourny."
755047,misfish,2012-12-29 21:14:00,29133,"   :rofl2:  :rofl2:  :rofl2:   NOT  I can see my ,STACKED,got mistaken. bUT thats the WWW for ya."
755048,Christopheraaron,2012-12-29 21:33:00,3525, I'll organize them all if we agree to it
755070,bigugli,2012-12-29 23:23:00,6138,I think the team format works best for OFC and the spirit of this site. Teamwork reflects community effort and spirit.
755071,mike rousseau,2012-12-29 23:44:00,4661, I like the team format...  But on the other hand it didn't help me meet anyone new or fish for new species.... It was fun... But I know personally an individual tournament would motivate me to learn new techniques and travel to new places and fish new species... Wich represents the site and the sport as well....
755072,Jacob,2012-12-29 23:46:00,186,I think we should do both team based and have the individual.  What ever is decided I will be in for both.
755073,Freshtrax,2012-12-29 23:49:00,2215,I'm gonna take pictures of the splake I catch tomorrow just in case .  I'm in for both.   I didn't join last year because I felt like a loser for not being active the year before.
755074,Twocoda,2012-12-29 23:50:00,4130,Count me in for 2013....I had fun in the 2012...it actually was the defining factor on weather i wanted to fish on certain days...not that i need a push to fish....but its always good to have that little extra hope of contributing to the team...we may have landed in second place ...but we looked better...lol..
755078,Leecher,2012-12-29 23:56:00,7832,"I'd like to stir things up a bit... Team format should stay and instead of adding inches with biggest fish... you get a point for a fish caught... members are to send their captain the results and monthly, captains sends their accumulated results to the tournament organiser / chef in charge.   Very simple and everyone has the feeling of participating to the team... I know it's a lot more work but most importantly, fish spend less time out of the water and can be released quickly  Just my thoughts Jacques"
755082,misfish,2012-12-30 00:26:00,29133, Some one say CHEF? Im yer man.
755086,limeyangler,2012-12-30 00:39:00,5204,I like the tourney as is. Yeah...some teams get 'stacked' but its the luck of the draw.  I agree with the comment that it engenders the community spirit to have a team format....like they say...if it aint broke.....
755088,Acountdeleted,2012-12-30 00:47:00,2562,I missed the boat last year. I'd like to sign up now please.
755092,Leecher,2012-12-30 01:08:00,7832," My idea was a little blurry... Team format stays the way it is, you need your tournament sign for pics, you can register only one fish per species a day, you get one point for each fish caught per species a day.  Member of team submit their catches to captains, and captains of each team submit every month to their tournament chef / tournament organiser.  Tournament score card is updated monthly.  Simple, it's the same format as previous tournaments but instead of adding inches, it's points   Everyone on any team can contribute.  Jacques"
755093,spincast,2012-12-30 01:12:00,3279, X2
755094,4x4bassin,2012-12-30 01:18:00,1025," Have to agree here with Simon and some others , if we had an individual tourney you would have to change the rules around a bit because the musky/pike/walleye guys would have a huge advantage strictly due to the inches ! Guys like me who never fish for musky and walleye but fish mainly for bass and lake trout would be out of contention before it even started Whatever it is though , i'm in for sure"
755095,Christopheraaron,2012-12-30 01:23:00,3525," How many musky guys go fishing for catfish, steelhead and salmon though? The point would be to get people to open up to new ways of fishing."
755099,mike rousseau,2012-12-30 01:36:00,4661, Yup...  I'd have to travel for great lakes trout... Non Great Lakes trout... Quality Cats... Salmon... And Whitefish... So if I don't bust my behind to get these species there's no musky that'll make up those inches....
755100,danbouck,2012-12-30 01:51:00,4380,90% of people aren't going to need an individual online tourney for bragging rights only to motivate them to fish for different species.  IMO leave it alone and don't complicate it.
755102,nancur373,2012-12-30 01:59:00,1211,I'm in for team tourney
755111,Dontcryformejanhrdina,2012-12-30 02:21:00,535,"I'd be in, though I highly doubt I catch any great lakes trout, salmon or whitefish since I never have and don't have the gear/knowledge to catch them. What are the kind of fish in the contest?"
755120,dhickey,2012-12-30 02:34:00,1038,Im in got a new camera from Santa as well as a new tapemesure. Whatever the format Im in Looking forward to a new year on the water and a return to the rivers Tight lines and good luck.
755139,Djeep,2012-12-30 03:05:00,199,"I like the team format but I can never remember the OFC sign and when I do, i never catch anything  Id like to sign up again this year even though i was unable to make a contribution last year"
754922,limeyangler,2012-12-29 06:16:00,5204,Is it a go?  Who would be up to run it? Anyone? Joey?  I will be a captain again.
754923,bigugli,2012-12-29 06:42:00,6138,I'm in as well. I'll be a cap again.
754924,lickmyarmpit,2012-12-29 07:49:00,359,And I will help win
754937,soobnoob,2012-12-29 13:09:00,55,Can non-boaters join?
754938,Roy,2012-12-29 13:16:00,13728, Of course! Maybe half of tourney participants are non-boaters.
754945,LefroyFisherman,2012-12-29 13:39:00,602,"I'm in again, got a longest fish each of the last two years, I'll try for a different species next year and make it three in a row."
754953,Christopheraaron,2012-12-29 14:58:00,3525,"I'm in, and if captains are needed ill step up"
754954,Christopheraaron,2012-12-29 14:59:00,3525,Maybe have an earlier start this year so that we have a chance for some through the ice?
754956,Marko,2012-12-29 15:09:00,854,I am going to create a spread sheet and start putting some name down. Sooner we start the better lol
754957,Roy,2012-12-29 15:22:00,13728," You don't need a spreadsheet for that. A notepad/word document will work just fine. Or, you can just read the names of the people who are interested right here on this thread!  But thanks for your involvement."
754970,Jacob,2012-12-29 16:43:00,186,I agree on that early start.  Maybe the ice will make it to march this year
754978,grt1,2012-12-29 16:59:00,638,i'm in for next year
754980,davey buoy,2012-12-29 17:12:00,5505,Me too!!!
754985,mike rousseau,2012-12-29 17:22:00,4661,"I thought an individual tourney would be great.... It would encourage  anglers to travel to fill all species... Which might result in some meetings between members to help each other out with tricky species.... And it gets anglers to try new styles of fishing for ""new to them"" fish...  I know it would probably get me to do 2-3 more trips this year...   Any thoughts...???"
754992,Christopheraaron,2012-12-29 17:43:00,3525, Sounds like a great idea! I'll run it if we wanted to do 2.
754993,spinnerbaitking,2012-12-29 17:53:00,1622,I'm in if you'll have me lol Tight Lines SBK
754996,Christopheraaron,2012-12-29 18:16:00,3525,Just don't crush your sign lol
755003,limeyangler,2012-12-29 19:36:00,5204,"  I'd have to go quite some way to get a catfish, great lakes trout"
755008,Christopheraaron,2012-12-29 19:40:00,3525," How about 2, 1 for teams, one for individual?"
755013,mike rousseau,2012-12-29 19:51:00,4661, Very true... But everyone has some advantages/disadvantages.... Like you'll get a big walleye for sure.... And you can get whities.... Pike... Perch... Crappie.... Lakers.... And your fairly close to unreal musky...  Not everyone will have the ability to fish for every catagory....  Like I'd have to travel for non-Great Lakes trout... Great Lakes trout... and whities.... Everything else I can catch in my area... Not the biggest... But they're here...
755016,mike rousseau,2012-12-29 19:54:00,4661,I think either way lets get them started now... As in let people take pictures now and hopefully the threads are set up in a few weeks to enter pics....  We can still decide to keep it the same or add individuals as well... Same picture logo....
755020,Christopheraaron,2012-12-29 20:02:00,3525,"I like the individual idea, that way teams can't be stacked."
755031,misfish,2012-12-29 20:25:00,29133,"  I think we should all get together,throw are rods in a big pile,and have some one pick them out, and throw them into indvidual piles.Just like we did in pick up hockey. That way it,s even.LMAO  Oh wait,theres always that team that got stacked. It,s the luck of the tose Chris."
755034,Christopheraaron,2012-12-29 20:34:00,3525," LOL. I more meant that when you're on a team you're relying on others, if the one musky guy, or one walleye guy on your team can't get out you suddenly don't have a chance, this way there are no excuses, if you can't get out you lose, if you get out as much as you can, exploring new species you'll have a shot."
755037,LefroyFisherman,2012-12-29 20:42:00,602,I'd be in for the individual tourney aswell
