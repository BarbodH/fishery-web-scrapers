754594,GBW,2012-12-27 14:41:00,8460,Hey all.  So I got a set of Baffin Titan boots for Christmas   and I want to know your thoughts on the traction on the ice with them.  Are there any ice spikes (like these icespike.net) that I can use or will I even need them?  Thanks all.  G
754595,Nipfisher,2012-12-27 14:48:00,2449, The Titan's with composite shank and toe are the ones we use during the winter at work and I have never heard complaints of slipping.
754605,misfish,2012-12-27 15:45:00,29133,"Geoff,I bought a pr last year. I LOVE THEM. Best winter boot I have owned. Baffins is a great product."
754606,tightline,2012-12-27 15:51:00,322,I work outdoors all winter and wouldn't be caught dead without them!  There going to be great out on the ice..
754613,misfish,2012-12-27 16:22:00,29133,I didnt get the steel toe or shank. Mine are for recreation use.
754616,Nipfisher,2012-12-27 16:38:00,2449,  The models we get are composite toe and shank as the stell is heavier and gets cold.
754629,tightline,2012-12-27 18:16:00,322,  Mine too all composite..the steel toe and shank freeze up in the winter
754631,GBW,2012-12-27 18:20:00,8460,thanks all.  I'm not worried about the temp and cold feet however I do want to know how good they are on ice.  Do I need ice spikes?
754632,ketchenany,2012-12-27 18:27:00,3229,"  Go test them on Jarrow Cres.  You'll find out if they are waterproof, mud proof and how they will be on ice."
754633,davey buoy,2012-12-27 18:27:00,5505, Sounds like there good all around Geoff!!.
754634,Terry,2012-12-27 18:28:00,14456,I use strap on spikes or whatever they are when there is little snow on my Baffins
754635,GBW,2012-12-27 18:33:00,8460,LOL!!!  Maybe later today  I hope so and I'm sure they are too  you use what?!?!?  Ohhh the strap on spikes!  I just wasn't sure if the ones I have will fit because they don't fit all that well on my old boots and these are a lot bigger.
754995,GBW,2012-12-29 17:58:00,8460,"FYI, love'n the boots!  Now I just need some safe ice to put them to the real test..."
755278,misfish,2012-12-30 22:08:00,29133,Toasty warm toes today Geoff. And it was figg.n freezing today.
