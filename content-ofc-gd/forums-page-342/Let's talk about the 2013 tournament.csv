755149,Leecher,2012-12-30 03:24:00,7832," In the old way, there wasn't categories to begin with... why add them to this?   Yep!   I totally understand your point but put yourself in a kids place and catching dinky bass and perch and being able to submit them for points for any team, is a positive way to participate in an adult tournament."
755151,Leecher,2012-12-30 03:34:00,7832," Yep, one pic per species to get points   Good points Mike!   Bill no, not lenght... if you caught 2 15in perch, only one would count for that day   and why not?   Take the measurement out, not required and only one fish per species per day"
755152,Dontcryformejanhrdina,2012-12-30 03:35:00,535," They can still participate if it's in inches, either way I doubt a kid wins it lol. That's why I suggested the different age groups, I realize that makes for extra work, but why not keep track of their fish/total inches throughout the year (like everyone else), then after it's over find out the ages of each young participant and the most total inches in that age group wins? That isn't THAT hard, certainly easier than taking a picture of every perch every day out on the water."
755155,Dontcryformejanhrdina,2012-12-30 03:40:00,535," I simply don't have the time to be out on the water every day, or even more than twice a week if I'm lucky. If I catch a nice sized perch I'll gladly take a picture of it holding a sign, but I'm not doing that 30 times a year for any 4"" perch I catch lol."
755156,dhickey,2012-12-30 03:40:00,1038, What would you think about each person is only aloud one entry per species based on inches? In other words all team members will be motivated to catch the big one Not the most fish.  Example would be that I can catch 50 bass on a good day and none of them are worth concideration on the one day I cant catch a minnow a 6-7 pound bass comes up?? Or I can go out on Simcoe and hammer 12-13 inch pertch at will(not fair to othes)  Not every one has the oppertunity to fish 100 days per year . Thats not to say those that only fish 20-30 days dont know what their doing??  Inches work.  0 0
755157,DoubleDigits,2012-12-30 03:41:00,140,"How about something like this: Agree on a list of species. Not everyone will be necessarily close to all on the list, but limit it to fish that OFC members regularly post from Ontario waters. Obviously, as seasons open, the species become fair game. Award points based on length measurements, with ruler/photos. Award points weekly, same day every week all submissions are to be in by certain time. Keep score from Jan. 1 to Dec. 31. Points go to biggest fish (longest), second biggest (fewer points obviously), and maybe something for third too.  This way, big fish catching prowess is rewarded, but so is multispecies, variety...but most of all consistency through the seasons and overall hardcoreness.  I'm assuming this would be an alternate to the main OFC tourney"
755158,Christopheraaron,2012-12-30 03:42:00,3525, Is this a challenge? I accept!
755160,Dontcryformejanhrdina,2012-12-30 03:45:00,535," Haha I don't doubt there are many kids out there that would beat me, but I'm not exactly the competition you have to keep an eye out for."
755161,Leecher,2012-12-30 03:48:00,7832," Some good points here also but I'm trying to stay away from making categories cause those did not exist in the old tournament format.  I don't see why this is a big deal... you go out fishing, catch pike, walleye, bass, catfish, sun fish, perch, take a pic with sign and submit it.  Simple to me"
755163,BillM,2012-12-30 03:58:00,17367,"I like the biggest fish per team, per category..   Add up the inches at the end of the year and you're golden.  Someone who catches 3, 30 inch muskies shouldn't be getting more points then the guy who hauls in a 55in fish."
755164,Christopheraaron,2012-12-30 03:59:00,3525, Pick a buddy and I'll take both of ya on
755167,Dontcryformejanhrdina,2012-12-30 04:09:00,535," Am I talking to Bob Izumi's kid or something? lol Don't worry, I don't think I'm a threat to anyone when it comes to fishing competitions. I've been out fished by my nieces....the first time I took them fishing."
755168,Leecher,2012-12-30 04:16:00,7832, Looks like my idea of points is out the window... thought I'd make suggestions to a new format but for some it's too much to ask Ah well I tried TJunkie  I'm out
755171,Christopheraaron,2012-12-30 04:20:00,3525, LOL!
755293,spinnerbaitking,2012-12-30 23:06:00,1622,"If you want a Team Event with more participation maybe go with biggest fish from each member in each category, it's more work but the members could keep the picture on their computer until the end of the month & send them in if each member covers more species your inches will add up pretty quick so a 10"" Perch, a 14"" Bass, 28"" Pike, a 18"" Rainbow, 12"" Speckle, 16""Walleye, a 23"" Carp & a 19"" Catfish could add up, all ages Entries could help out, Just My .02 Tight Lines SBK PS: But I do like the way it is now too"
755300,Leecher,2012-12-30 23:28:00,7832," Richard,  I do get what you are getting at... but seems that for some, inches  and biggest is the way to go.  I have no problems with that.  With the current format, if you don't get a bigger fish... well, mind as well quit  and go with the flow & cheer for the team.  TJunkie"
755302,spinnerbaitking,2012-12-30 23:34:00,1622, If you add Biggest fish by each member of the Team in each category all members could contribute Tight Lines SBK
755306,Leecher,2012-12-30 23:55:00,7832," My original idea was, you get a point for each species of fish caught per day but like Mike Rousseau mentioned, we could do this on a monthly basis... every month members submit their pics and get a point for each species that have caught.... that way, you get the feeling that you belong and contribute to your team.  From my personal experience, not having a boat and being shore bound, this gives me the extra kick in the $$$$ to go out fishing.  It's hard for me to explain and may be I'm not getting my point out the way it should but I still think a tournament based on points will get more of us to participate / contribute to our individual teams.  TJunkie"
755097,Leecher,2012-12-30 01:31:00,7832,Bring your thoughts and ideas...  I'd much see points then inches in the same format.  What you think?
755106,Leecher,2012-12-30 02:14:00,7832,"Here's what I propose:  All same rules apply from previous years, so nothing changes, instead of adding longest fish, you get 1 point for each species of fish caught per day.  You're only allowed 1 fish per species per day.   Members are responsible for having a tournament sign in their picture taken of their catch and submitting it to their Captain.  Captains are responsible for submitting their teams catches every month to organiser.  Organiser updates the tournament score card every month.  The most points wins it.  That simple.  What you think?  Jacques"
755107,Christopheraaron,2012-12-30 02:15:00,3525,I could do it.
755110,Leecher,2012-12-30 02:21:00,7832, So Chris you agree it's a good idea
755112,mike rousseau,2012-12-30 02:25:00,4661,"Biggest issue I have with this idea is that I'd have to take over 200 pictures with an ofc sign and submit them ALL....  Second.... By that system a 55"" musky is worth the same as a 5"" perch or a 10"" bass....  All this system will show is who has the time to be submitting pics and info all year.... Someone can catch 1 little perch every day and register and get more points then someone who gets 100 nice bass every Saturday because its 1 point per species per day....  I like the idea of change and I think if we all put our heads together we can figure something out...."
755117,Leecher,2012-12-30 02:31:00,7832,
755119,LefroyFisherman,2012-12-30 02:31:00,602,I think it has to stay as the length of the fish. Should there be a cut off for number of individuals?
755121,soobnoob,2012-12-30 02:34:00,55,"Why not put more point value on ""trophy"" fish? Eg. A 50+ inch musky worth more than a 45 inched... In other words, rather than overall inches vs overall species... But a point system within each species  If I'm way off, lemme know... First timer here"
755123,Leecher,2012-12-30 02:38:00,7832," All rules from previous tournaments applies... this format takes out the measuring of fish so that when you are fishing and catch something, only a pic with your sign in it is required... taking out the stress to the fish of having measure it."
755124,mike rousseau,2012-12-30 02:39:00,4661,I fish about 100  days a year and usually get more then one species....  Sometimes 3-4.... So yes.... I'd have to register 200+ pictures if I want ALL my points.....   Right???  Or did I misunderstand your proposal?  I'm not trying to be a smarty pants here either....
755125,mike rousseau,2012-12-30 02:42:00,4661,  But your talking about stressing way more fish instead of a few bigger ones... No?
755127,Leecher,2012-12-30 02:43:00,7832, Hey soobnoob this is what it's all about... bringing ideas and sharing them     I'm just suggesting simple ones to let the shore fishers and kids have a chance to submit their catches... total points vs inches makes it more accessible for them
755128,Dontcryformejanhrdina,2012-12-30 02:48:00,535,Wouldn't that put people who can't get out fishing every day at a severe disadvantage right off the bat?
755129,BillM,2012-12-30 02:49:00,17367," You're only registering BIGGER fish then your previous ones though.   So unless you're catching 60+ inch muskie and 35+ inch walleye, you can't be submitting that many pics, lol."
755130,Leecher,2012-12-30 02:51:00,7832," I understand what you are saying Mike... In your case, since you go out fishing a lot more then any of us, yes you will have to submit more pics then any of us but think of a kid that only gets to fish a few times a year and when he does, can submit what he caught...  with the old format, he would just have to forget about it.  discouraging him to try for something bigger.   No, once you have a pic of a specie with the sign, others you catch can be quickly released, no need for pics then."
755133,Leecher,2012-12-30 02:56:00,7832," It would put them in a severe disadvantage in the old or new propose way, doesn't matter."
755134,Dontcryformejanhrdina,2012-12-30 02:57:00,535," Why not have separate categories for kids and/or shore anglers then? Different age groups, perhaps? It's not like a 6 year old is going to have a chance at out fishing Mike lol.  Maybe categories for ages 5 and under, 6-10, 11-14, then shore anglers in their own category (any fish caught from a boat counts towards the boat angler's category, regardless of who's boat it is)."
755136,BillM,2012-12-30 02:59:00,17367,That sounds like a lot of work.
755137,Christopheraaron,2012-12-30 03:01:00,3525,"I'd prefer not, takes away from it."
755138,Dontcryformejanhrdina,2012-12-30 03:04:00,535," But the old way, a skilled angler could fish once a week and have a good shot at catching a large fish based on skill/knowledge. Meanwhile any guy who lives on a lake with multiple species could easily ""beat"" the other angler by simply taking a picture of any dink bass/perch/whatever he catches each day.  I'm not that great at fishing but under the total inches category I'd at least have a chance at staying competitive through luck, and it would inspire me to fish different species rather than just 2-3 kinds of fish. This way I wouldn't even bother trying because I know I wouldn't be on the water as much as other guys, I just don't have the schedule/opportunity for it."
755140,Dontcryformejanhrdina,2012-12-30 03:05:00,535, So does taking a picture of EVERY species of fish caught EVERY time out lol.
755143,mike rousseau,2012-12-30 03:11:00,4661,  The only way I could see points working is if everyone gets 1 point per species caught period..... For the year.... Then the more species each person gets the more points they contribute to the team... So say 15 species... Each person can potentially add 15 points to their team score.... Then everyone's fish count for something.... And it encourages everyone to try new species.... It would be a bit of a combination of individual recognition with the team as well....
755144,BillM,2012-12-30 03:13:00,17367," I guess I'm not up on the tournament rules..   It's total length for each fish species?  So if I caught 2 15in perch, I'd submit 30inches of perch for my team?  That's insane."
755146,Dontcryformejanhrdina,2012-12-30 03:17:00,535," I was under the impression that he wanted it to be 1 point per fish species caught each day. So if a person could catch a bass, perch and walleye every day they get 3 points every day. No way in hell I'd be able to keep up with that lol."
755148,LefroyFisherman,2012-12-30 03:21:00,602,"There's no way I would take a picture with the sign and measurement for every fish I catch, I think we should just keep it too one fish total length per species."
