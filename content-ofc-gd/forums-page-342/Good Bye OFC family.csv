755533,Dave Bailey,2012-12-31 21:57:00,1641," Relax, the latest archaeological research indicates that once the musky hunter calendar ends it simply begins anew, but those who follow it are now required to target rock bass for the duration of the next calendar. I think it's carp after that..."
755539,Handlebarz,2012-12-31 22:14:00,3790,"For sure Phil we need to get you and Pj up here in July.  Dave I think I'm gonna look funny tossing 10"" lures targeting rock bass but he there is no season on them so this might be a good thing. If a CO asks me why I'm fishing musky OOS I will just pull out my phone bring this thread up and inform him I'm after rock bass but these pesky musky keep bugging me"
