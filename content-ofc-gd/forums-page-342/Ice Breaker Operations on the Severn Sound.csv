MIDLAND, Ontario – The Canadian Coast Guard in partnership with the United States Coast Guard and the Southern Georgian Bay Detachment of the Ontario Provincial Police have an important safety message for all ice-surface users of the outer areas of Midland Bay and areas heading out to Giants Tomb island.  Icebreaking operations will begin in Midland Bay the morning of January 1, 2013. USGCS Mobile Bay will be providing icebreaking assistance to the bulk carrier Frontenac. The operations are expected to conclude January 5, 2013.  The broken and fragmented icy track left behind by the ice breaker may not freeze.
