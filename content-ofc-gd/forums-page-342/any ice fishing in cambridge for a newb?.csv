I've not had a chance to go ice fishing yet and was wondering if anyone could point in the right direction. I'd like to stay within cambridge and am willing to fish for anything that bites. I fish only for the sport but do want to stay legal all the way. Any advice is appreciated. Thanks in advance."

755512,ricardo,2012-12-31 20:30:00,26,Ill deffinitely try both when ice allows me to. Is valens worth going to? I was told it is expensive but no one knows what the fishing is like?
755520,Christopheraaron,2012-12-31 20:50:00,3525,"little lake is also good for panfish, never fished it in winter though"
755524,Rich,2012-12-31 21:02:00,3927,"Valens can be good.. takes a little legwork nowadays, but still produces."
755638,Marko,2013-01-01 13:57:00,854,Is Puslinch lake still open to public fishing? It was loaded with hammer handle pike last time i went (2 years ago i think)
755643,Rich,2013-01-01 14:37:00,3927,"Puslinch had a lot of ice access cut off, still do-able but takes a lot of walking. I'd personally go to shades over puslinch if all you want is some hammer handles."
