754746,turtle,2012-12-28 13:12:00,274,I have a Garmin Montana 650 GPS and would like to load hydrographic lake maps for Ontario (mostly for Lake Simcoe) onto it.  Is the Garmin Blue Chart map the only option?  How do like using it?  Thanks.

754752,Terry,2012-12-28 14:26:00,14456,"I don't think you asked if you bought the right make...so  imo garmin maps are great, more and better details of lakes  and I have both lowrance and garmin........and if you type in the right words in google you can get them for free if yours has a memory card a friend can give you an image of lake simcoe too"
754780,BillM,2012-12-28 17:00:00,17367, You probably don't have your Garmin setup properly if you're not getting ft by ft contours on it.  I've got Bluecharts on my Garmin 62S and have no issues getting great detail with it.
754791,Fisherman,2012-12-28 17:28:00,7201, Terry are you talking about ibycus?
754792,Terry,2012-12-28 17:32:00,14456,not really
754968,porkpie,2012-12-29 16:27:00,2521,"Well if you are, Ibycus is freeware, and nothing that needs to be spoken in circles about!"
755077,bassfanatic25,2012-12-29 23:51:00,36,Garmin Bluecharts and the Inland Lakes card will both have Simcoe!  Great maps too
755104,BillM,2012-12-30 02:02:00,17367," Ibycus is topo, not hydro.  Terry is most likely referring to one of the many torrent sites out there"
