Iv been waitting for this stupid ice to FREEZE!!!!!!!!   its frozen........ but its ugly out there.   2 '' of slush/water/1/2 frozen soft    mixed with 1'' of water then the black ice starts 3-4 ''  THANK GOD!!!!!!!!!!!!!       The Pike fishing has just begun and the tip-ups were going all over the place.     Today was a mix of perch, bass and pike.        The action was on and off. but the jiggin action was steady.  20-30 perch were caught.  and a dozen bass. 3 1/2lbs beeing the big one.  We ended the day on a seriouse note.       This pike was a seriouse fighter hand down the best TOE to TOE fighter out there.  some would call him M.M.A stuff.  in the end hes going to be our new year supper!    :jerry:     Much more to come stay tuned."
