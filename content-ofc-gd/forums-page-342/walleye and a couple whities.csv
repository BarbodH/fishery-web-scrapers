755466,mr blizzard,2012-12-31 16:10:00,1589,"SIMON< SIMON< SIMON.............  We are booking a flight and coming over for dinner, looks fantastic. My son and I are licking our chops just looking at the plate, what a presentation.  As you remember, we targeted whitefish back in Ontario, followed by lakers. We are not having much luck getting whities up here unfortunately, through the ice I am speaking.  Try cubing up some whitefish, nugget size, put them in a zip lock with some fish crisp, shake it up and leave in fridge for a few hours. Then heat up some olive oil in a fry pan on medium, no more than an 1/8 of an inch, fry the fish till golden brown, then enjoy.  We are still hopeful we will sometime soon catch some whities on the jigs you sent us.  Cheers Blizz and Ben. Happy New Year to u and the family."
