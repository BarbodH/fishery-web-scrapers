755011,BillM,2012-12-29 19:50:00,17367," Mike, you mean you don't warm up your rod?  ....er.......um...."
755024,Roy,2012-12-29 20:14:00,13728,Maybe we can all back off a little and try to respond to the OP's post. I'm quite sure that he posted for fishing related information and not to learn about everyone's physical limitations.
755025,BillM,2012-12-29 20:15:00,17367,"Roy, how's your rod working in all that snow?  I kid I kid!!  /back to your regular scheduled programming."
755029,Roy,2012-12-29 20:23:00,13728," Well William, I had a super Supper at my son's house last night and learned from my grand daughter that I'll probably be a great grandfather in mid August. So, I'm not concerned about anyone's ""rod"".  Sorry about derailing this thread."
755030,esoxansteel,2012-12-29 20:24:00,1307,"  LMAO           	 must be workin OK, he sent the snow out the the Rock"
755033,misfish,2012-12-29 20:32:00,29133, Super news my friend.  As for the OP.  My first  was the Quantum tour edition 13'. Great rod.
755035,Christopheraaron,2012-12-29 20:39:00,3525, Congrats!
755206,JCT,2012-12-30 14:28:00,1,  45 years building rods learn something new every day ( warm up your rod ) get back on your meds
755225,Canuck2fan,2012-12-30 17:02:00,1444,"Took my dad out for some chrome fishing on Monday and I broke out a ""new"" 11.5ft IM8 black Swan company noodle rod, that I purchased 5 yrs or so ago, and had sitting in the closet. I bought it because it was such a deal at the time and keep it in the plastic in case I happened to break another of my rods (haven't had any breaks luckily)... Finally after reading on here a while back that nobody uses noodle rods anymore I decided to use it to see if I could figure out why... noodle rods are passe?  I didn't ""warm"" it up but I have to say after going 2 for 2 with an 8lb hen and 5lb male in some pretty strong cross current at the end of my favorite pier it didn't lack more than enough power for what I generally catch. BTW didn't get what was wrong with using a noodle rod either, had a blast playing those fish.  Then yesterday I went out fishing with a friend who has an 8ft clarius and who is looking to upgrade to a longer rod in the same series. After checking out his 8ft which has to weigh about 4 to 5 ozs more than the 11.5ft swan I couldn't imagine fishing all day with a longer clunkier clarius, but maybe I am just getting old LOL. Even my crappy old 11.5ft Shakespeare Catera is lighter than the 8ft shimano my friend has...  + I would definitely go for a streamside as a starter rod over the clarius unless you need the 4pc to fit in the car."
755227,moxie,2012-12-30 17:26:00,1566,"Fish it, if it breaks within the warranty period return it and if it doesn't break keep fishing it. When it does eventually break buy another. When a snag occurs, whether underwater or from the canopy above be sure to pull straight back through the tip guide thus greatly reducing possible rod breakage as well as making sure rod is clear of either vehicle door and tailgate edges. Good luck."
755242,Garnet,2012-12-30 18:18:00,2056,"Fishermen are generally not open to suggestion.  They think I've fished/built rods for 45 years I can't learn anything.  The smart ones will pickup a rod that has sat for years and do the little test. I talk to 2 this morning down at the river, both very impressed. They no in steelheading it will help you punch that float out a few ft. So don't try it you might learn something."
755248,GBW,2012-12-30 19:31:00,8460,I have yet to fish with my Streamside but I LOVE the look and feel of it.  Oh and the price point I got from Mike (MTBF) @ Gagnon's was great too!  Streamside get's my vote too!!  Have you seen the new centerpin reel they have too?!?!?!?!
755322,RiverGuy,2012-12-31 00:37:00,19,I like to think of myself as open minded when it come to learning something new about fishing and I did warm the rod up and when I bent it it did not break and I can't wait to give this rod a shot after I get the casting down with it...the okuma I have is 13.6' and its a 3piece rod. And being just a beginner in float fishing I'm open to any and all suggestions that are going to help and make it easier for me my first time out on the river. I know it's going to take time to get used to it and to me that's going to be the challenge and I can't wait to catch my first fish on it..it's easy to let the drag do the work for you on a spinning reel but to be able to fight the fish on a reel with no drag has got me excited. Thanks for all the advice about rods
755350,ChrisK,2012-12-31 01:35:00,2772,"No worries bud,we are all open minded around here. One time I brought a brand new muskie pole home from the shop and tried to show my wife how strong it was. I ended up with molecules all over the kitchen floor after I tried to warm it up muskie style in front of her Thankfully it had a life time warranty on it and I new the fella who sold it to me not more than 20 minutes previously.  Anyhow you go out and let a couple big steelhead warm that Okuma up for ya like it was intended for and make sure to take pictures so you can come back and show all these folks just how its done. Have fun and keep things simple and you'll do fine..."
755360,RiverGuy,2012-12-31 02:29:00,19,"Thanks ChrisK can't wait to get on the river I have yet to catch a Steelhead or Salmon since coming to Canada and i""m looking forward to haveing some of them on the end of the Okuma. I did manage to find a pick of a carp I landed down at Port Credit a couple years ago. And i used it as a profile pick...and keeping it simple is what I like to do best."
755442,Thrilla,2012-12-31 14:38:00,164,Have a buddy that runs an Okuma and he has no problem banking fish with it... I have the streamside... It works great for me
755495,Canuck2fan,2012-12-31 18:24:00,1444, There is only one thing better than catching your first chrome... and that is CATCHING MORE of them LOL. Every time I break out a new rod or hit the streams for the first time in a while it is just like catching that first fish all over again. I can't understand the people who say they get tired of it.
754844,RiverGuy,2012-12-28 21:23:00,19,Hello everyone i am just getting started in float fishing. I am wondering if anyone knows were i can buy a shimano clarus or a shimano convergence rod in the brampton ontario area..i got a okuma adventa for x-mas from the wife as a suprise but im taking it back since i have read that they are not very good rods to get started in float fishing...i am on a budget and from what i read shimano seems like a nice rod to start with...would prefer the clarus...Been doing tons of research and i am very excited about getting into float fishing.  Thanks
754846,BillM,2012-12-28 21:26:00,17367,"The Adventa is fine rod for a beginner.  If you're going to return that, then I'd suggest a Streamside over the Shimano."
754847,RiverGuy,2012-12-28 21:32:00,19,Thanks Bill i am just nervous about using it because of all the horror stories i read about them breaking and i really dont want to come home and have to tell my wife i broke it the first time out fishing with it.....im going to pratice my butt off before i hit the river with it.
754848,BillM,2012-12-28 21:33:00,17367,"Have you put a bend in the rod yet?  Did it break?  If not, don't worry about it."
754855,RiverGuy,2012-12-28 22:17:00,19,I will do that as soon as I get home from work tonight...and if it don't break I'll be fishing with it for sure thanks again Bill
754856,Garnet,2012-12-28 22:20:00,2056,"One thing you should do with new rods is warm them up a bit.  Quietly start shaking up and down, progress until you are shaking really hard. Get those molecules hoping."
754874,RiverGuy,2012-12-28 23:56:00,19,Thanks for the advice and tips going to give it a shot in a few min. I will let you know if all goes well thanks again
754879,Christopheraaron,2012-12-29 00:16:00,3525,"I've landed some big salmon on my okuma, just don't put insane pressure on them and you're fine."
754880,Joeytier,2012-12-29 00:21:00,3990,Clarus's are generally heavy and bulky blanks...I can only imagine how uncomfortable a float rod would be.  Stick with the Okuma until you want to invest in something more upscale.
754883,Garnet,2012-12-29 00:52:00,2056,Guys are buying up the 4 piece clarus. Little tiny cars and long rods make the 4 piece desirable.
754898,RiverGuy,2012-12-29 02:32:00,19,I warmed up the rod for about 20min. And man my arm is hurting LOL and I bent the rod and it bends really nice didn't want to go to far just in case...I like the weight and feel of the rod I am going to keep it and give it shot...can't wait to start practicing casting with it
754910,kemper,2012-12-29 03:35:00,2232,  Uh...  ah nevermind.
754920,DundasSteelheader,2012-12-29 05:46:00,166," LOL  Riverguy I think he meant like a quick warmup 30 seconds or so. Iv'e never warmed up a rod in my life and never broken one, so I don't think its completely necessary but maybe imjust lucky"
754928,Garnet,2012-12-29 11:40:00,2056,"Ok River guy pay attention you are going to learn something.  Find the rod in your collection that hasn't moved or been touched in years.  Now pick up that stick and gently tap the tip on the floor. Pay very close attention to how sensitive it feels.  Now warm it up gently in the beginning and then shake the hell out it.  Now tap the tip on the floor notice it's 100's of times more sensitive.  For steelheading sensitivity is not really that important but a live rod will improve casting, hookset and not snap your prize stick."
754944,porkpie,2012-12-29 13:37:00,2521,"Yes yes, warming up a rod.... That's the ticket..... LOL. OP, there is nothing wrong with an okuma or a clarus for that matter.  Either will work well!  The nice thing about clarus is they are 4 piece.   I have been chasing rainbows for over 25 years, and some of the over complications I see guys getting into these days makes me laugh my butt off!  These rainbows aren't  terribly hard to catch once you have the hang of it!  I see fellows running fancy Florescent line, then ""shot leaders"" and then leaders etc etc, and agonizing over float and hook selection to the point of ridiculousness.  The truth is steelhead fishing has become a fashion show!  Any of the factory stuff available today easily bests most of the high cost custom stuff from when I started out, and I am still fishing some of that stuff 20 plus years later!  I have 2 clarus rods, a 13 and the 11'3"" for my son.  I have them for the trunk factor, but I wouldn't feel put out by the okuma I can tell you that!  Heck even 2 piece streamsides are lovely rods for the $100 outlay!  Enjoy your new pole, but don't over complicate the sport.  They are beautiful fish but they aren't rocket scientists!"
754951,kemper,2012-12-29 14:55:00,2232," Bingo.  I fish custom rods because I enjoy building them, but I promise they don't help me hook any fish.  They're only fish, and they aren't nearly as hard to catch as people think.   I'm still blown away by the rod warming up thing..."
754960,Garnet,2012-12-29 15:39:00,2056,kemper custom or rack rods it doesn't matter you are not getting the best out of your sticks. And the higher price (more graphite) the more effect a little warm up will give you.
754963,solopaddler,2012-12-29 16:05:00,8605,It amazes me the gross and utter misinformation that occasionally gets posted on this board.
754977,RiverGuy,2012-12-29 16:58:00,19,I have fished rainbows and browns on spinning rods and even bait casting rods...I'm not new to fishing been soon it for years I have been in Canada for about 2 years now...immigrated up to Canada from California. And when I got into fishing up here I noticed tons of people on the river with float rods and it sparked my interest I. Giving it a shot now I am excited to try this new style of fishing and the more I can learn about it the more I want to get on the river
754983,Burtess,2012-12-29 17:22:00,901," So if I'm fishing late season in really cold temps do I have to warm up the rod more often, should I tape hand warmers to it to keep it warm, or put a wool sock over the handle?  What about ice fishing rods?  I hope I don't look like a tool whipping them around on the ice to keep them warmed up.....  Burt"
754999,kemper,2012-12-29 18:59:00,2232," Don't warm up your rod too often though, I hear you'll go blind!"
755000,Spiel,2012-12-29 19:08:00,9065,Let's keep this on track please.
755001,Garnet,2012-12-29 19:21:00,2056,"Ah Kemper is that what your mommy told you, must have been asleep in chemistry class. A fishing rod is just molecules. They rate rods 45 mod 80,85.  The faster you get those molecules going the more sensitive your stick. Just take 10 minutes and learn something."
755005,Roy,2012-12-29 19:39:00,13728,"Hmmmm, we're also all just molecules. Do you think that if we all jump up and down, we might also all be more sensitive....to others? Dunno, just a thought on your molecular theory,"
755007,Steve,2012-12-29 19:40:00,2075,"roy, now that was funny."
