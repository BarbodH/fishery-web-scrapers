755297,kickingfrog,2012-12-30 23:15:00,8333,"His brother lives out your way too. He posted photos of TO, Ottawa, Kingston and Montreal. Maybe you're out the other window?"

755311,Sinker,2012-12-31 00:05:00,8692,How about get in your car and go see for yourself? What ever happened to those days?  S.
755314,Acountdeleted,2012-12-31 00:08:00,2562,Those days I could fill my car for 50 cents a litre.
755315,Sinker,2012-12-31 00:11:00,8692,And there was no internet.......and lots of fish.......and hardly any fisherman.......I miss those days!
755332,Fisherman,2012-12-31 00:55:00,7201," Well matter of fact I did this morning, left home at 09:10 one quick stop for a java to go and got to Virginia Beach around 10:30.  Over to Port Bolster, Caseys for a quick chat along the lake rd for a bit and then back home for 2:20. Found a few of the small parking spots that get gobbled up pretty quick on weekends."

755353,stendec,2012-12-31 01:44:00,22,   Whats Virginia Beach looking like? I'd drive over and check it out but its about 2 hours from me
755354,Terry,2012-12-31 01:47:00,14456,from what I see on the photo it's frozen to the island but the ferry is still going
755374,Sinker,2012-12-31 03:48:00,8692,  Atta boy. I've done that drive a few times myself. It was a nice day for a look see today.  S.
755400,Fisherman,2012-12-31 11:58:00,7201," Not great, I'd give it another 3-4 duyas just to be safe."
