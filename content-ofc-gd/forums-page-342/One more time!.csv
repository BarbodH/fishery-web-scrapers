754604,RangerGuy,2012-12-27 15:40:00,564,So I have to go out to Kingston on Jan 4th weekend... Do I have any chance of getting my new boat out 1 more time..  I'd love to do some duck hunting out on quinte but I have no time to scout so hopefully I can get one more walleye trip in before I put her away for the winter.  I normally launch on @ the Glenora ferry.  What do you think my chances?
754620,Steve,2012-12-27 17:09:00,2075,Ferry will be inaccessible. See Bath (finkles park)
754653,RangerGuy,2012-12-27 20:31:00,564,"Hi Steve, thanks for the info  Do you mean the ramp will be froze up probably or that the ferry isn't running? Sorry.. I can be a little slow at times LOL!"
754657,Steve,2012-12-27 20:41:00,2075,Ramp will be froze.
754661,lew,2012-12-27 20:53:00,12766,"Greg, contact Superdad from this board for the ramp info.  He was fishing the Reach just last week from his boat and should be able to let you know what's available."
754685,Steve,2012-12-27 22:16:00,2075,"i'll do my best to give a ramp update on Sunday.  we are heading out this saturday.  not the best time of the year to be playing around on the reach unless you have a lot of experience with that specific body (and section) of water, the launches, the winds, etc."
754706,msp,2012-12-28 00:29:00,1336,The ramp at the ferry was fine as of yesterday. 4x4 needed for sure.
754711,Steve,2012-12-28 01:52:00,2075,"wow. really?  i wouldn't have expected that in a million years.  i still remember the good days when I was dealing with freezing ferry conditions first week of december (2004, 2005, 2006, and 2007).  hmmm, you have me thinking now.  ferry is a much better ramp than finkles."
754840,RangerGuy,2012-12-28 21:05:00,564,I'm not worried about water conditions just ice. I'm in an 18' Lund Alaskan she'd have to get pretty bad for me not to get back to ramp safely :-)
754845,RangerGuy,2012-12-28 21:24:00,564,Thnx guys for the help my fingers are crossed!
