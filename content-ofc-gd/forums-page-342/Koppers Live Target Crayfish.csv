755180,Cudz,2012-12-30 06:34:00,2652,Has anyone used the Koppers Live target crayfish lures with much success?  I went to dick's sporting goods and they were on clearance so I bought 6 of them in variouse sizes. colours and diving depths.  I got them for $2.98 each so I figured I couldn't go wrong as they look to be made pretty well.

755204,Roy,2012-12-30 14:23:00,13728,"If you like those baits, you scored big, Chris. They're $9-$10 on EBay. I've never used them but I can't see them being bad."
755205,ckrb2007,2012-12-30 14:28:00,449,"I stopped in a Dick's Sporting as well on a recent trip to the States and got the same deal as well. Can't beat the price, that's for sure!"
755215,aplumma,2012-12-30 15:48:00,6896,I have used the whole line of there baits and they work great. One of my favorite baits is the mouse for largemouth bass.   Art
755453,johnnyb,2012-12-31 15:16:00,3413,"I think that they made some changes to them for 2013, as there was a whole pile of these being sold off very cheap over the last few months.  I picked a few up for $1.50 online...probably paid the same as you after shipping.....good action, cast a mile, dive nice and deep.  Didn't work'em too hard though, so no bitemarks on mine yet."
