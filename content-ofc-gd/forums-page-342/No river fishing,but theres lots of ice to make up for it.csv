755496,misfish,2012-12-31 18:43:00,29133,"I guess I was very fortunate, to have pretty much, the winter months to fish the river last season. It never froze up once,and the temps were  bareable. Well being sent a pic of some of the spots I fish,it was a sad day to hang up the float gear.  BUT,,,,,,,,,,, Alls good.  THERE,S ICE TO BE HAD.  DAY 1  Yesterday,Terry and I headed out to a back small lake. It was fridged, to say the least.Bitterly cold,-15. But we made the best of our day,by the time it was time to leave,we were having a heat wave.  Terry managed a few fish.Think the cold front put lock jaw on dem fish.  To keep the minnows from freezing up,I banked the bucket up with snow. Insulation. Worked great.  As the sun started to rise,we could see a slight rain/snow crystalbow,trying to form.      Like I said the bite was slow,but Terry managed a few brutes.      A cool shot of a set up.    DAY 2  Terry and I were to hook up again,on a different lake,but unfortunatly,we were unable to hook up. He had the left over minnows,so I decided I would go with something different today. I wasnt paying for more minnows. So picked up a jar of gulp maggots .Their new. I figured what the heck,I was going for crappie anyways. So off I headed to a small lake and try my luck.What a difference a day makes. -5 and little wind to speak of.  My plan was to drill and find the weeds,then find a spot with an opening in them. Took about 10 holes or so,but found a spot.  So it,s time to fish. It wasnt the fastest catching day,but I managed 5 fish for my effort. There was a surprise though. I used the same little micro jig,tipped with a single magot,and got 3 crappie,AND ,2 snot rockets. LOL  Pics.          And what caught all of them.    It sure feels great to get out on the ice.Fresh air and great company.  Lets hope that snow and 50 km winds their calling for on new years day is incorrect,as I have another adventure in store.    HAPPY NEW YEAR EVERYONE"

755530,Joey,2012-12-31 21:46:00,9122,Well we're ready to roll too   Some ice on Simcoe would be nice.  Guess we may have to travel a bit further north now that I saw this report.  Got my ice fishing juices flowing  Thanks for the great report guys
755547,esoxansteel,2012-12-31 23:03:00,1307,"travel and you will find some open water full of chrome, and if not fish them through the ice in the rivers, in the deep holes where they over winter.  "
755570,misfish,2013-01-01 00:20:00,29133,"  I use to fish the credit through the ice for bows. It was a blast. I can still recall when I was driving a side rd,and  I seen this older fella sitting out on the ice ,just up from the rail track bridge.I was curious,so I walked out,struck up a conversation, and it was very educating.  I was 18 then. Fished that spot with him til I was 23. I learned how to build those plywood,tarp folding huts from him.One season I went back ,and there was the same group,well except one. These are what make memories to be thankful for.  His name was Gord.  EDIT,,,  Those huts,we could leave them on the banks,up against a tree for a week,and they would still be there for us to use. Try that these days."
755575,Christopheraaron,2013-01-01 00:27:00,3525," The lower is all locked up, not enough to fish through though."
755581,misfish,2013-01-01 00:46:00,29133,Thanks Chris. Im not seeing any trip that way. It was nice to remember though.
