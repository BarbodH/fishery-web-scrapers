755087,Acountdeleted,2012-12-30 00:45:00,2562,Got out on Buck Lake today in Huntsville. No fish but got to try out the gear. The ice was safe from shore to shore as well. A good 5 to 6 inches in every spot.
754477,Guest,2012-12-26 17:22:00,0,"I just bought all this fancy gear to go ice fishing and it doesnt look like Lake Simcoe is even close to freezing over.  I keep trying to get my fix by looking through my fishing album and holding my christmas presents (by the way most are fishing stuff except socks), but I just cant seem to get through the day.  I wonder if Sobeys would get upset if I practice using my new ice fishing rod in there fish tank?"
754479,davey buoy,2012-12-26 17:40:00,5505," You may just be the only one!,maybe?."
754493,irishfield,2012-12-26 19:37:00,26272,Drive 4 hours North.. there's ice.. but take a spud bar!! I can sled to my dock apparently.. .but no further up the lake in Temagami.
754494,johnnyb,2012-12-26 19:43:00,3413,Yep...plenty of ice if you are willing to drive.  Made it from Brampton to North Bay in 3.5 hrs with a stop for gas and no excessive speeding...and that was over a week ago.  Smaller lakes in Muskoka icing up too....heck I know a guy who was on Rice.  Simcoe isn't your only option
754511,Joeytier,2012-12-26 21:38:00,3990,3 hours will find you lots of ice...  I've been out every weekend since December 1st...
754512,Guest,2012-12-26 21:44:00,0,Thanks for the info guys.  So what would be the best lake right now to go to?  If im going to head up I want to make sure I can see people ice fishing cause im not taking any chances right now going out alone.  Im still new.  If so where also would be the best place to park?
754516,Woodsman,2012-12-26 22:21:00,1286,Heading for Temagami in about 9 hrs.
754517,fishindevil,2012-12-26 22:46:00,6254,Lots of small lakes in Haliburton are froze and guys are fishing but only walking out and I guess there's some guys fishing the lower end of pigeon lake too but if you don't know the areas you want to go better be safe and wait a week things are getting better lots of cold temps and my lake which is sturgeon lake I making ice big time !!!!! Cheers
754528,NAW,2012-12-26 23:37:00,4022,"I would love to get some early ice crappies.  Might be some back bay honey holes in Muskoka ready for a chip step.  Just to get me even more excited, I thought I'd post a shot from LAST year.  "
754534,Joeytier,2012-12-27 00:15:00,3990,Pick up a map and maybe a stocking list.  Small lakes will be more than safe.
754662,bobowski,2012-12-27 20:58:00,360,Anyone know if Little Lake will have some safe ice by the morning. Im seriously contemplating going. I have the itch really bad.
754663,davey buoy,2012-12-27 21:02:00,5505, Which little lake?. If it's the one I'm thinking Would be nice to know as well'
754665,bobowski,2012-12-27 21:14:00,360,Barrie
754666,BucktownAngler,2012-12-27 21:16:00,582,"from what i hear not safe yet (little lake, barrie)"
754667,davey buoy,2012-12-27 21:18:00,5505, Might be a weekend possibility?.
754668,bobowski,2012-12-27 21:22:00,360,I've heard some reports of safe ice from another board. I've heard 4 inches. I'd rather be safe then sorry so thats why i was asking. If I have to drive further I will.
754669,Acountdeleted,2012-12-27 21:23:00,2562,I was looking into Scugog but it looks iffy. I'm trying to figure out how far North I have to go to be safe. Would be nice to make a trip this saturday around 2 hours.
754710,landry,2012-12-28 01:47:00,1005, I wanna go badly too. Maybe Monday or Tuesday. I am cautious though. Would love to hear about a small lake with crappies or lakers that I could fish. PM me if you can help me out. Thanks. I know it is not cool to ask for secret spots. I would gladly trade musky info for a great laker or crappie spot:) Landry
754715,Freshtrax,2012-12-28 02:11:00,2215,I heard there's huts going out on couch.  ( word of mouth)
754717,irishfield,2012-12-28 02:35:00,26272,"A foot of fresh snow up here (Penetang) and almost 2 feet in the Ottawa Valley... not gonna help make safe ice, it's only going to make it more dangerous. If you don't know where you're going.. DON'T !"
754722,kuhaman,2012-12-28 03:47:00,503,That's a great pic!
754767,Acountdeleted,2012-12-28 15:25:00,2562,I'm thinking Buck or Fox lake in Huntsville tomorrow. Does anyone know if these have public access? If not I might give Lake Vernon a look.
754774,johnnyb,2012-12-28 16:22:00,3413,I'd be very surprised if Vernon has any safe ice.  Fair bit of current in there.  No clue on the other 2 lakes you named....but for sure there will be some small lakes with ice if you do a bit of driving around.  Or check in at a bait shop....
754775,Acountdeleted,2012-12-28 16:25:00,2562,"Thanks Johnny. Thats what I'm hoping, head to the bait shop at 8, then hopefully they can point me in the right direction."
754843,ciceri,2012-12-28 21:09:00,535,"We were fishing near Madoc like two weeks ago, and smaller lakes around Bancroft are good said the lady in the bait shop."
