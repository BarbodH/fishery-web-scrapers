626584,canada414,2011-09-30 19:34:00,40,i'd say he's pretty lucky to be alive yikes
626588,HTHM,2011-09-30 19:49:00,4082,Darwin award candidate!
626590,woodenboater,2011-09-30 19:59:00,2277,"Probably didn't take a safety course and I hope he truly appreciates how SO damn lucky he is to be alive. If he's married, his wife should put locks on the triggers."
626595,mbosh1980,2011-09-30 20:15:00,349,"Of course he's fine! He had his orange vest on, what was the worst thing that could have happened?"
626596,smally21,2011-09-30 20:20:00,993,lucky guy! i was thinking the ending the ending was gonna be different when he looked down the barrel.  60 seconds for a misfire!!
626600,ccmtcanada,2011-09-30 20:39:00,7971,Yikes!!!!!!
626601,irishfield,2011-09-30 20:42:00,26272,..and nobody suspects that's staged eh...
626604,Billy Bob,2011-09-30 21:01:00,5865,"Better yet, she should purchase the BIGGEST life insurance policy she can muster up..."
626605,Billy Bob,2011-09-30 21:02:00,5865, My FIRST thoughts....
626607,woodenboater,2011-09-30 21:04:00,2277," I was wondering about that esp with the camera rolling but regardless, it looks like a supremely stoopid thing to even attempt. Extremely stoopid and definitely Darwin of the Year worthy.   "
626608,Terry,2011-09-30 21:04:00,14456, just watched it and yeah seems staged..  if not then the really stupid thing was releasing the video to the internet so people could call him stupid 3000000000 times
626614,glen,2011-09-30 21:27:00,2641,Too lazy to reach all the way up there and take off your hat?  Shoot it off.    Hope he dont go fishing.

626648,Twocoda,2011-09-30 23:04:00,4130,im going to guess his sequel will involve an apple and bow....
626696,Daplumma,2011-10-01 01:01:00,1961,I suspect a gun control group made this and posting this is exactly what they were looking for.Its only funny untill they take away your guns. Joe
626774,Ralph Field,2011-10-01 13:12:00,1018,"I can not believe that anyone would be stupid enough to try and stage this, which implies that he is in fact an idiot."
626791,registerfly,2011-10-01 13:56:00,198,"maybe no safety course where he lives for sure. I too thought it was somehow staged but ""funny"" nonetheless"
626806,mattp33,2011-10-01 15:04:00,290,"""i hope that he wakes up every morning and watches this video and says today I will not be stupid ""  BEST LINE EVER!!!"
