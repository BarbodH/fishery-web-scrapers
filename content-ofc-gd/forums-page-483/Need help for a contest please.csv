626187,asdve23rveavwa,2011-09-29 13:20:00,2690,Done!!  Nothing like the serenity of paddling through our beautiful wilderness.
626787,Teressa,2011-10-01 13:43:00,55," Thanks Frankie, you are so right!  Thats my daughter & bf in the pic, which was taken with my cell phone. I have to say it takes better pics than my camera LOL!"
626854,Big Cliff,2011-10-01 19:10:00,6899,"OK, so I hit ""liked"" before I knew it was my grandaughter and her BF in a canoe in the wilderness! But since you took the picture I guess things are under control. Sex at his could be fatal, cause I'd kill him!!!!!!"
626871,Teressa,2011-10-01 20:22:00,55," RFLMFAO Dad. I meant to say ""It's MY daughter & MY bf"" in the pic.  As it was, I was impressed neither Tara nor Claude tipped the canoe just to shut the other one up or get even with each other.  I also wouldn't have been that far away had Tara been out there with her bf....at least not without something more powerful than a cell phone"
