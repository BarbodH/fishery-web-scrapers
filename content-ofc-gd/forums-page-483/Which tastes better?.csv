He wants to know which to bring back, either Arctic Char or Grayling? Any suggestions from you guys who have been up there or tried either?"
626203,adempsey,2011-09-29 13:54:00,1498,"I can get Arctic Char from the fishmonger (tastes similar to Rainbow Trout IMO - never had it fresh caught though).  Never seen Grayling for sale before.   So, it's possibly more ""unique"" or I just never came across it.  BTW, why not both??"
626214,Musky or Specks,2011-09-29 14:45:00,2710,both going to be pretty much the same but given the choice I'd take grayling as has been mention you can get char in a lot of places
626229,troutologist,2011-09-29 15:25:00,951,"My vote would be for char, never was crazy about grayling....not much better than char."
626300,fish_fishburn,2011-09-29 17:59:00,1311,Grayling didnt impress me either.
626367,kickingfrog,2011-09-29 20:08:00,8333,"I've have been fortunate enough to have eaten both fresh from an Arctic River. Both were great, but I liked the greyling more. I also prefer walleye and perch over trouts, salmons and chars. It is really a preference thing more so then one is better then the other."
626368,lookinforwalleye,2011-09-29 20:15:00,4399,As long as it`s bacon wrapped Rob!
626376,BIG FISH,2011-09-29 21:21:00,54,"fresh arctic char are my favourite, never tasted any fish that i thought was better. actually... "" i like it raw ""     its good cooked to tho         i think it depends where you get it from and if its fresh or not. i think the smaller 2-6lbers taste the best. the ones i caught were on baffin island and tasted good even when i snuck a few home"
626385,craigdritchie,2011-09-29 21:59:00,1586,"Grayling, every time. To me, sea-run char doesn't taste a whole lot different than sea-run salmon."
626545,mirogak,2011-09-30 15:38:00,387," Hey man, how the hell did you get up to Baffin island ... good for you."
626551,Billy Bob,2011-09-30 16:48:00,5865,"Never had either but Lake Trout is nothing more then a char...but as someone else has already mentioned...it depends on where it was caught, what it was eating and how well it was cared for after the catch.  BTW  I have a great recipe for salmon for those who normally don't like salmon...if interested PM me.  Bob"
626739,Bob,2011-10-01 07:11:00,370,"Yep, lakers and specks are both members of the char family and grayling are from the whitefish family. Take it from there. Trout or whitefish? My preference would be the trout."
626753,Guidofisherman,2011-10-01 12:16:00,206,Thanks everyone for the replies. I'll pass on the opinions.
