I've had fish from certain sections of the Thames and lived to tell about it, although wouldn't do that again once I found out how many treatment plants dump back in.

But other fish from Ontario I have and still will eat....Red meat will get you way before a few salmon from Lake Ontario will.  BTW I wouldn't eat ANY bass from anywhere...but that's just me...crappie, perch and walleye are in my freezer...learn to catch them and you wouldn't eat a bass either.  Bob"

I actually bought a few fillets last fall, and I prepared it much like most would do a walleye. One bite later and the fish was in the garbage. The texture was akin to eating fried fat, but more tender. Totally inedible   "

Smallie in the 17"" range averaged 1.1ppm I believe.  Of course I cant remember where I read it, or what bodie(s) of water it involved.  PCB's are a concern as well, but this is where cutting out the fat content helps. Methylmercury on the other hand is throughout the entire fish   "

626047,whitbyboatguy,2011-09-29 01:35:00,130,Another factor is that gobies are just not bottom feeders. Gobies eat zebra muscles. Zebra muscles are chock full of toxins.  Don't put that fish to waste though...use it as fertilizer.

626113,Toronto_Angler,2011-09-29 03:24:00,698,Can be any worse then some of the conditions that the other meat we eat lives in. Ever see some of those factory farmed chicken coops?
626114,irishfield,2011-09-29 03:25:00,26272,It's better than any of the processed fish you're buying in Food Basics.....
626118,smally21,2011-09-29 03:49:00,993,most of the fish i catch in the harbourfront area are covered in lesions and boils of unknown origin. the anchor comes up out of the bay covered in inches of thick oily slag. when i was a kid at sailing school on the bay we'd overturn our boats in rough weather. if you accidentally swallowed some water you would puke almost right away. bodies way of telling ya something. i've been advised by local marinas to flush the motor every time you go in the bay due to the water being so caustic.  who cares what the book says. if ya want fish tonite try the fish market.  i wouldn't eat a 4lb bass from any lake that's a personal thing....

626230,[emailÂ protected],2011-09-29 15:26:00,97,While we are on the topic of eating bass...for all you bass eaters..do you'll have a personal size limit for largies and smallies beyond which you wouldnt eat em.. I dont usually eat largies since i am not a fan of the taste of the fish but dont mind filleting a smallie every now and then...Usually keep fish in the 15 -17 inch slot....but the more I think about it..fish that big here in Canada are pretty old...thoughts?

626311,Ralph Field,2011-09-29 18:19:00,1018,"I would not eat any fish coming from lake Ontario . I have seen fishermen dragging half rotten salmon around, but I assumed they needed the eggs from the fish and were taking the fish home for fertilizer instead of throwing it in the bush to smell. I can not imagine anyone desperate enough to eat those half rotted salmon."
626318,eman,2011-09-29 18:36:00,101,"Serve it with Flava beans and some Chianti.  Jokes aside, you should eat it and document what happens.  No seriously, I read an article a few years back stating Hamilton Harbour was in the top 20 most toxic freshwater sites in North America, which eventaully led to the environmental cleanup project ongoing."
