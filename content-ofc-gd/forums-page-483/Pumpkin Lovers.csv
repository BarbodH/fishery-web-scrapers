626981,Billy Bob,2011-10-02 11:39:00,5865,"Don't know why but I have always loved pumpkins....at this time of the year I am on the hunt for large pumpkins for $3 or less....it's a QUEST for me...I drive my duck hunting partner John crazy because on the way home I always take different off the beat roads looking for farm side stands for that GREAT PUMPKIN ""DEAL""...this year he has threatened to buy me one so he doesn't have to go thru this ordeal again....  But anyways, I have read about his almost every year and need to go to this pumpkin weigh off next year if I remember...these are H U G E pumpkins....I might even be willing to spend $5 on one of these BRUTES...  http://www.buffalonews.com/city/communities/clarence/article578373.ece"
626982,Roy,2011-10-02 12:06:00,13728,I used to grow them out back. I didn't have the room nor the time to ever push them past 300lbs. But it's very doable. I used to deliver a bunch of them like a thief in the night with a neighbour's trailer...we'd drop them off at different kids' houses for a morning surprise. That was fun. I'd always have a few out front for Halloween ambiance. 
626984,Sandbag,2011-10-02 12:15:00,533, Very cool Roy  Did you buy the seeds or did you cultivate your own strain over the years?  Cheers  Craig
626985,lew,2011-10-02 12:20:00,12766, You've always been a true friend to the younguns Roy
626986,Roy,2011-10-02 12:24:00,13728,"No Craig, these were just store bought seeds. They were $1.50 a pack or something. The ones I used were called Atlantic Giants. Lew, I'm thinking you have the perfect place to grow those."
626989,lew,2011-10-02 12:33:00,12766," Actually Roy, my garden was a bit of a flop this year. Tomatoes and beans were so-so and the cucumbers hardly even broke ground thru the ground.  Good thing there's a farmers market just down the road"
626996,Handlebarz,2011-10-02 13:13:00,3790,Lew  you need more musky fertilizer it will make your garden grow big time

626998,lew,2011-10-02 13:28:00,12766,"You could have something there Mike, maybe I'll bring a big fattie home from LSC in a couple weeks"
