627058,Rod Caster,2011-10-02 19:07:00,5784,"Have fun. The Shell station on the highway makes great pizza, try it!"
627066,bucktail,2011-10-02 19:40:00,1857,Looking forward to it. Wish I was going with you!
627083,muskymike,2011-10-02 20:32:00,772, I would rather go to the Harbour View for a shake. Much better then anything Wings (the shell station) puts and and cheaper too.
627090,Rod Caster,2011-10-02 21:00:00,5784," I'll try the Harbor View next time I'm there. Wings' cheeseburger pizza is something... . But yes, they are expensive there."
627287,stasbrute,2011-10-03 16:02:00,206,"Good to know guys, hoping I am too full of fish to resort to pizza and cheese burgers, but I will keep my options open."
627295,asdve23rveavwa,2011-10-03 16:19:00,2690, Just don't ever buy gas there...yikes!!!!  To the OP...good luck!!!
627301,Billy Bob,2011-10-03 16:45:00,5865, You haven't lived until you've eaten pizza from a gas station...  Sorry....I couldn't resist...  Bob
627306,Rod Caster,2011-10-03 16:53:00,5784,"  What's wrong with the gas there? or are you being sarcastic about my pizza at a gas station comment?  I actually buy food and gas there quite often... they make good pies too! Now stop making fun of my gassy food preference, guys"
627309,asdve23rveavwa,2011-10-03 16:56:00,2690," Wasn't making fun of you....just seems their gas prices are always way higher than any of the towns north or south of them. Had a good chilli there last year...speaking of ""gassy"", lol!!"
627312,Billy Bob,2011-10-03 17:20:00,5865, They charge higher prices on gasoline to help pay for the executive chef they have on staff....
627320,muskymike,2011-10-03 17:54:00,772,"  Its very true. If you are heading up from the south, gas up in Nobel. If you are coming down from the north, you can get gas cheaper in Britt somehow, before that the Key or French.  Payne's isn't that much more expensive then Wings and they are on the Water. They have always been more expensive, and it didnt help when Larry bought the place."
627332,Rod Caster,2011-10-03 18:29:00,5784,"  haha, and they also overcharge on some of the food items. $ 4.00 for a to-go soup!!"
