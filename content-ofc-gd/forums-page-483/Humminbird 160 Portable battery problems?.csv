627176,Raycaster,2011-10-03 02:16:00,528,"Bought a Humminbird Piranhamax Portable fishfinder 160 (08-19-10) and pretty happy with it. Before this weeks trip to Big Hawk lake I thought I'd charge the battery (Last used in June) and the charger started clicking in between colors. I used the unit anyways and it worked for awhile but the screen flashed randomly and finally shut off on the second day.  When charged before it would last all week easily...  Anyways, the battery looks brand new with no leaks etc. but is probably the culprit.  Not sure on the warranty, (will look it up) but does anyone have other ideas?  Also, let me guess, if I'm on the hook for another battery it will probably be crazy $$$? A friend said it looks like a security camera battery...  Checking BassPro now (where I bought it).  BTW, skunked and probably got a cold on Big Hawk. Stormy Friday night, ok Saturday, and cold rain Sunday with no fish to show. Gonna have to read more posts on trout success stories for sure!"
