625356,bassmaster4,2011-09-27 14:18:00,801,"Caught this last friday on the live target hollow body frog. Was working it real slow and real close to shore when this bad boy enhaled it, was pretty strange because it didnt even disturb the surface i just noticed my frog was gone then i hooked it and it took me for a bit of a ride. I dont have a weight on it but i was thinking around 6 pounds (correct me if you think im wrong). Well here are the pics.            Thanks for viewing. Bassmaster"
625363,Mike Pike,2011-09-27 14:46:00,1332,"A great fish you got yourself there, Bassmaster4, and Congratulations!!!  Funny, but I bet not having the bass expode on ya helped you hook it.  Alot of times that initial explosion tricks most people into setting the hook right away( myself included )when it's best to wait 'til you feel the weight of the fish before setting the hook.  WTG!!!!!"
625366,LucG,2011-09-27 14:50:00,779,Nice bass for sure! Good Job!
625368,bushart,2011-09-27 14:52:00,2628,Beauty fish --congrats
625373,bassmaster4,2011-09-27 14:59:00,801," Definately helped me hook it Mike. It basically started fighting me right away. I couldnt tell you how many times ive ripped the bait right out of the fish's mouth when it explodes on it, i guess it's the adrenaline rush that makes people get too anxious while setting the hook. Thanks"
625378,adolson,2011-09-27 15:02:00,783,"Wow, it looks like it could eat your whole head in that first pic! Nice fish!"
625379,bassmaster4,2011-09-27 15:04:00,801,Yea! it had a huge yap
625396,BillM,2011-09-27 15:26:00,17367,"I find that largemouth usually slurp a topwater down without much of a commotion.  Smallmouth on the other hand like to come over the top, then all hell breaks loose, lol!"
625403,johnnyb,2011-09-27 15:38:00,3413,"Yup...a silent hit by a largie usually means that he's got it all the way in his mouth, and is usually a larger fish.  Big head...skinny body...at the right time of year I would say 6lbs might be right....hard to tell how chunky he is in the pics though.  Doesn't really matter...it's a gorgeous fish!  "
625404,mercman,2011-09-27 15:41:00,7054,What a BUCKET !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Congrats.  X2 on the smallie. The big one i caught on Saturday hit my lure the split second it hit the water! Even before i had a chance to lock my spool. What a ride i had
625409,limeyangler,2011-09-27 16:02:00,5204,Big yap for sure!  Congrats on a great PB!
625414,ckrb2007,2011-09-27 16:32:00,449,"Awesome bucket! Looks like a skinny largie, especially in the second pic. Doesn;t seem to be anything in it's gut. It's a real beauty none the less!! Congrats on your PB. I agree with BillM about the largies slurping a topwater bait.....especially the big ones. Unless you're fishing the skinny water in the slop. Then they tend to explode like the smallies do."
625439,ah_long,2011-09-27 17:46:00,354,"great fish, I would say around 5~5.5lb because the stomach is flat..  but if it's well fed, definitely a 6lber, great catch"
625443,Whitespinnerbait,2011-09-27 17:53:00,2038,One Hell of a Hog right there!!.......Congrats!!
625477,northernpike56,2011-09-27 19:42:00,717,THATS A BEAST!!!
625483,singingdog,2011-09-27 19:56:00,1047,"Nice fish. I hope you marked it, and come back for it later when it's got a belly on it. At that length, and with that head, that fish could go 7 lbs if it was well fed."
625520,MCTFisher9120,2011-09-27 21:52:00,3761,Nice pictures and Largie dood!
625646,splashhopper,2011-09-28 01:49:00,2931,
625651,Rizzo,2011-09-28 01:56:00,4754,ooh she's a dandy!
625721,ehg,2011-09-28 12:01:00,2666,That fish has some length. Maybe 5 lbs or so now but could be more when it fattens up. Nice fish.
625791,bassmaster4,2011-09-28 14:47:00,801,when do they start fattening up guys? I've been fishing this spot for a while now at different times of year and all of the largies ive caught there are skinny like this one. Thanks for everyones input and compliments
625817,Thrasher,2011-09-28 15:36:00,39,BEAUTY!!!! Nice work!!
626505,fish-miester,2011-09-30 12:44:00,864,"Great Fish buddy, congrats!"
626896,rockfish,2011-10-01 22:19:00,91, Nice lunker there and I've found the bass haven't been in the usual spots lately. They probably went deeper and it may take a bit till they get used to the cooler temps. Pretty soon they'll be putting the feed bag on for the Winter.
626898,kickingfrog,2011-10-01 22:32:00,8333,I wasn't paying attention... are we allowed to call that a monster?
