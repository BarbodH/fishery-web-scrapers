We know its not a fishing vessel but were sure going to make it out to be the closest thing we can to one!! I need a part for it(I'll post about later) stupid story a little to excited and few beers later and we fried an electrical component  but hopefully sombody will know a guy who knows a guy who can help me out with that later..  Looking for advice on how to cut a live well into the floor, make a bench backseat that lifts up for the gas tank and battery.  Maybe even put a permanent gas tank in, cut a hole in the side and fill'r at the pumps!  Any links to videos and how to sites would be appreciated. Thanks All Progress pics to follow"
