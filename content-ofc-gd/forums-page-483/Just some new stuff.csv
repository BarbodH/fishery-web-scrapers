Anyway I'll put up another quick little report Sunday.  Anyway I wanted to share a picture of my rod collection. I remember a bunch of us sharing pictures of tackle and gear in another thread but can't seem to find it.  I picked up a couple G.Loomis rods and love them all! Well from front to back here is what I have now. Only one rod left, a TWFR855 I think it is, a Frog rod that's 7'1H I believe.  NRX854  7'1H F with a  Core50MG7 BCFR893 7'5MH F with a Curado200E7 SBR813 6'9MH XF with a Curado200E7 CBR783 6'6M Mod.F with a Curado50E   Also still have my little 6'9ML Avid with the Stradic.  Anyway put some pic's up of some new gear if anybody has it!  Have a good weekend and fall guys and girls.  MTBF"
