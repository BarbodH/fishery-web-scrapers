Two extra days of fishing for us.  So far fishing has been outstanding, but catching is quite a bit off.  Weather went from nasty last week to beautiful this week, with south wind, until a shift to the north yesterday.  The wind shift turned things around.  Air was fresher.  The inside diameter of my nostrils expanded.  Eagles were in the air.  Fish became excited.  We've been able to pick up a walleye dinner in a matter of minutes, but we're getting only 3 or 4 in each spot instead of being able to stay and keep pounding them.  Fish are scattered and hard to locate.  Water level is extremely low which prevents me from getting to moving water.  Scenery is outstanding and changes every day.  Drove the 1485 miles September 22 & 23.  Spent night of 23d in the airways office on couches that make into double beds.  It pays to have access to the office key.  We flew in early September 24 and will probably leave camp early October 3, unless weather forecasts show a cooling trend and bow hunters decide to stay a couple of extra days.  Just three moose hunters,Brett/camp owner, plus Norma & me in camp.  Life is great."
