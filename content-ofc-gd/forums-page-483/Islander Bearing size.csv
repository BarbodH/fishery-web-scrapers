I guess i could degrease them, and use a sewing machine oil, but I want to see how these are stock, so I'll give them a few outings to break in. (they spin fine when drifting a piker for salmon, but a small drennan needs a bump to get started. Btw I got the orange rubber sealed ceramic hybrids)  Size should be .125 width .250 ID .375 od If I remember correctly"
