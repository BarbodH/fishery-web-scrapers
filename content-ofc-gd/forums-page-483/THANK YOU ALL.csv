THANKS AGAIN,  Bob  Now go catch a fish....."
626837,mercman,2011-10-01 17:59:00,7054,"Maybe you should keep that crimper Bob. That little goat, errrrr puppy Just mite get the hankering for another meal of cable."
626840,Roy,2011-10-01 18:17:00,13728,"Here's another tip for you my sudden friend. If dogs like it that much, package and market the mix as ""Billy Bob's Kable Kibble""."
626842,mercman,2011-10-01 18:29:00,7054,  Thats a really good one my sharp little friend
626847,Big Cliff,2011-10-01 18:52:00,6899,"Should have got a beagle   :rofl2:  Sorry Bob, I just couldn't resist!  Mandy sleeps right through the night, doesn't chew things she should't, loves to just cuddle (and chase rabbits). You just had to get a lab! LOL. OH, and I am going to beat you in the football pool too!"
626873,Teressa,2011-10-01 20:28:00,55,"Billy Bob, when we got our middle miniature poodle, she chewed through the satelite/cable wires (as well as other wires/cables) too many times to count, she even ate my rose bushes several times!!!  What we had to do to stop it was take a piece of garden hose and run our wires/cables through that until she out-grew her chewing phase. It got too expensive to replace the wires all the time.  With all the things she ate, we are surprised she never got electricuted...and I did without rose bushes until about 4 years ago."
626910,muskymike,2011-10-01 23:40:00,772,"  Never met Roy in person, only seen him in pictures...but I know this much  low blow hahahaha"
626971,Billy Bob,2011-10-02 11:00:00,5865,LOL........LOVED IT  Old Man...you still got it....what it is we don't know or want...
626973,Billy Bob,2011-10-02 11:17:00,5865," Cliff, I know where you live and will deal with you later, buddy boy...  LOL..."
626974,Billy Bob,2011-10-02 11:19:00,5865," YEP, good idea there with the garden hose...been thinking about something similar but this is a bit more complex because of all the different wires going different places."
626975,Billy Bob,2011-10-02 11:22:00,5865," Too late......took the crimper back to Radio Shack yesterday on the way to a family reunion party....and also too late to call Tundra ""little"" she's getting friggin HUGE...at this rate (3 months old) I am expecting her to be somewhere between 6-7' tall on all fours..."
