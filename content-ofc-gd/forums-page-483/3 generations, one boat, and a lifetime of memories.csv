They dont get to see their grandson jack in person too often, but we are making the most of it.  My mum and dad came out in the boat today with Jack. My dad could care less about fishing, but Jack and mum are diehards and stayed focused for over an hour. Nothing like fishing for bonding.                       LOL...we did not throw dad out..he requested to be put ashore    when Jack woke from his nap"
