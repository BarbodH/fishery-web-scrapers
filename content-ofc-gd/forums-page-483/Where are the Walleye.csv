626452,MCTFisher9120,2011-09-30 01:43:00,3761,Guys were hittin them on Rice in the shallow water on worm harnesses.  Hope that helps a little.
626477,Billy Bob,2011-09-30 09:18:00,5865,You might get 100+ answers to that question but none might help you out.  What I'm saying is....you might hit Lake X on the wrong weekend or fish the wrong areas or use a improper presentation for this time of year.  But in generic terms I would try BIG GULL LAKE and try staying here... http://www.kirkkovecottages.com/  I am sure you will get MANY MANY more responses.  Good Luck and please remember to report back on where and how you did.  Bob
626502,mike rousseau,2011-09-30 12:26:00,4661,Bay of Quinte...  Or drive 4 hours and come fish with me...    : )
626533,johnnyb,2011-09-30 15:00:00,3413,Bay of Quinte for sure!  Call up Lloyd...you can find him here http://www.stevemorissette.com/uandme/ or on OFC as fishhunter.
626548,manitoubass2,2011-09-30 15:42:00,11391," There is no walleye in that vicinity, there all down in my backyard right now, well, a few are over at Limeys house too!   "
626665,Gord,2011-09-30 23:45:00,20,  Thanks a lot guys. That does give me places to look at.
626667,Rizzo,2011-09-30 23:52:00,4754,go to any kawartha lake and start throwing 9 inch sledges. You will catch walleye and possibly a musky
626709,Gord,2011-10-01 01:38:00,20," Are you for real, I have never used a 9"" lure does bass pro sell them."
626817,johnnyb,2011-10-01 15:25:00,3413,Yes...better buy a beefy combo to handle them too
626835,northernpike56,2011-10-01 17:54:00,717,bay of quinte is good and lake nippising was fun when i went too. I also get eyes at the grand river sometimes
