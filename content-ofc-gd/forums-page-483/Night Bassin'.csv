626389,rockfish,2011-09-29 22:23:00,91,"Had some luck fishing after dark for bass. I usually avoid fishing  in the night time in the summer cuz of the bugs and skeeters but with a bit of a wind the bugs are minimal.  First time I tried it just this summer, I was just throwing a senko texas rigged around and it was a surprise when I got one. Tried other plastics and got them on texas rigged Slug-gos, wacky rigged senkos, Yum Sooie baits that I pushed a rattle inside, Matzuo craws and had some luck with a Hula Popper. Also caught a couple decent rockbass after dark.                "

626396,Rod Caster,2011-09-29 22:41:00,5784,Great bass!
626399,misfish,2011-09-29 22:50:00,29133,You could pass as a young Terry.LOL  Nice bass.
626409,rockfish,2011-09-29 23:48:00,91,"Thanks guys, missed a few also when I didn't get a good enough hook set. Even got one on one of bigugli's flippin' jigs, but it was a quick release."
626419,mercman,2011-09-30 00:24:00,7054,Nice looking fish The darkness makes the big preditors bold and hungry
626504,ccmtcanada,2011-09-30 12:39:00,7971,Way to go!  Some real nice fish there.  Night fishing can yield some great results...not everyone can be bothered with it though.  That's ok...more fish for you to catch!
626506,eman,2011-09-30 12:51:00,101,"very surprised with your bait selection. How can the bass even see those lures at night, unless they all had rattles?"
626529,johnnyb,2011-09-30 14:53:00,3413,"Some really nice bass there....great job!  I'd never think of throwing plastics at night....now I will!  One thing I didn't understand though....the term ""decent rockbass"".  WHAT on EARTH is decent about ANY rockbass?!?!?!?"
626576,OhioFisherman,2011-09-30 18:47:00,6623," They don`t need to see the lure, the lateral line senses vibrations. I was an avid night fisherman, they can find a 4 inch plastic worm, a 1/8 ounce jig and pig in the dark with no problems, and I found them to be more effective than noisy surface lures most of the time.  Even walleye and panfish don`t seem to have a problem, only one pike in the dark, on a crank bait, but some big fished hooked and lost in waters with skis at night."
626621,rockfish,2011-09-30 21:34:00,91,"Yep, the lateral line is what they use to sense movement, like how baitfish swim in tight schools. I was surprised at how good their senses worked in the dark when I got them on plastics with no rattle. I just added a push in rattle in plastics that had room for it when things got slow. It didn't seem to make a difference though when they weren't biting during the cold fronts. They also seemed too lazy to hit topwater lures maybe cuz they are fat on gobies in Lake O."
