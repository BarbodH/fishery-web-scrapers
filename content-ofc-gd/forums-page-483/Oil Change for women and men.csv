626715,vinnimon,2011-10-01 02:13:00,2593," Better yet Terry , talking about deisels , and I had to laugh at this one. A quicky lube and a gas bar attached. Change the oil and filler her up please. I saw the end result And they say they are techs in the automotive industry I felt bad for the customer and threw in my 2 cents worth, you couldnt tell it was a deisel, not only did you f on one part, but on  the other part as well.  Since we are on this subject, and I am baffled by this. The units I work on are deisel anyway. The trailers we own with heaters are run by a small deisel engine. Fine. But this is the first fleet that ive encounter that use 10 w 30 instead od 15w40. Mind you ive worked on way too many of them and this is the first time ive seen this done."
626720,misfish,2011-10-01 02:29:00,29133,"Screw driver though the oil filter,yep,it works."
626822,Tybo,2011-10-01 15:40:00,1373,"Vinnimon: GM says to use 10-30 in my Duramax in harsh winter climate. With the lower sulfer in diesel, if fuel gets into the oil it will not break down nearly as fast as the old formula's of oil and fuel. So why not use a oil that make the engine(MOTOR)start easier."

626520,fishindevil,2011-09-30 13:44:00,6254,thats too damfunny !!! the thing is we have all had days like that for sure !! lol..lol..
626522,Dara,2011-09-30 14:00:00,3052,"About 25 years ago I was laid off and needed an oil change. I went to the parts store and gathered up the oil and filter, added it up and saw that I was going to save $5.00  I put it all back on the shelf and went to the jiffy lube drive thru...I will not do an oil change on my vehichle..I will do it on my boat, sled, ATV, but not my truck...it just ain't worth it.   But that was funny"
626527,The Urban Fisherman,2011-09-30 14:49:00,2050,LOL been there (except for the DUI part) But I'm here to tell you an Oil change around here is more than $24 and a case of beer is also more than $24...  I had my oil done a couple days ago...with taxes and the extra oil fee to fill the 5.7L engine it was 58 bucks... case of beer ranges from $30  to $50 boooo but the $58 bucks was well worth it...
626530,blaque,2011-09-30 14:56:00,2419,"Yep, stopped doing my own oil changes about the time i hit 30. Im actually on the verge of not washing it or cleaning the interior myself as well.......delta sonic has some pretty decent rates to have it done for you. By the pass, and get as many washes as ya want a month.  Its a truck......i dont need to detail it with a toothbrush like i used to do"
626531,blaque,2011-09-30 14:58:00,2419," I did my F-150 just 2 days ago, and with the extra oil fee PLUS a NYS inspection sticker it was 42 bucks. (NO beer was purchased)"
626532,Miracon,2011-09-30 14:58:00,200,OMG!!!!! Love it and sooooo true!  Just for the record...a recent WagJag was for 3 full oil changes from Midas (on Yonge St in Barrie) for $30! Awesome deal! No taxes or extra charges once you got their either. Gotta LOVE those Daily Deals!
626538,bdox,2011-09-30 15:12:00,329,"My first oil change went exactly like that, minus DUI and Imprisonment. An full synthetic oil change for my truck is approaching $90. I can buy the oil and filter for $55."
626541,HTHM,2011-09-30 15:18:00,4082,No it wasn't - not one grease fitting was greased....  Or is that another case of beer and DUI?
626542,Billy Bob,2011-09-30 15:21:00,5865,"I stopped doing them for several years but now I'm back at it....my Tundra Truck has a skid plate that needs to be removed, plus it takes 6.6 Qts of oil....so I use Walmart SuperTech fully synthetic oil (research revealed it's Mobil 1) which costs me about $26 plus $3.99 for the filter....so I get the job done right for $30 plus those damn NYS taxes...  ....I then go over to the fire hall for FREE beer...It don't get no better then that...  BTW when I was a youngen and had my first car I changed the oil in the street...or should I say I first flushed the oil pan out because I forgot to put the plug in....  ...it just a good thing I did it in the street because my dad would have KILLED ME....  ....also not a good idea to change oil on windy days....  Bob"
626543,lew,2011-09-30 15:34:00,12766," Same stuff here Dara, I maintain everything myself except my truck, just too much hassle there.  As for the beer, the last time I drank one I think it was about $10 for a two/four"
626555,Tybo,2011-09-30 17:07:00,1373,Women oil change $24 plus $2000. Because some kid that doesn't give a dam put 2L too much oil in and blew out the rear main seal.
626561,jedimaster,2011-09-30 17:46:00,3472,"I change mine. Takes about 15 minutes. I use ramps instead of a jack for oil changes, and if you put your oil filter on yourself and do it properly you don't need to use a screwdriver and hammer to take the filter off.   But funny none the less."
626562,Billy Bob,2011-09-30 17:53:00,5865, 2K for a rear main seal....no wonder mechanic's drive Mercedes....last time I did one it cost under $20....  ....but I hear Tybo...
626573,ricoboxing,2011-09-30 18:29:00,398,"for my pontiac vibe, there is enough clearance that i am able to crawl under the car without using the jackstands. I stockup on the oil when they go on sale (5L for $11), so all in it costs me around $17 to do.  Walmart charges $30 now so I prefer to do them myself.  For the pickup truck though, I'll just take it to the stealership."
626580,Skipper D,2011-09-30 19:20:00,1970,"Dam oil changes , dam those things , dam every thing , dam it i said . So i knocked the eight foot ceiling out of the garage and put in a houst and done away with those hellissh frigen jackstands , a sink to wash my hands after , a fridge for the you know what , used the debit , 5,000 bucks plus , damit !i said  and they can still do it faster for me at OIL CHANGERS  ,  the best part about all this now i can park two boats in the garage one on top of the other and the oil changes can go to........................................"
626599,Billy Bob,2011-09-30 20:36:00,5865, NICE....you're starting a oil change business....maybe next time I'm up your way I will give you the pleasure of changing the oil on my Tundra...
626603,Skipper D,2011-09-30 20:51:00,1970,"  Its likein a can  i say ,"
626609,206,2011-09-30 21:07:00,563,I had to laugh being A good # of those steps have apply'd for me....except the beer drinkin.  Funny my HUD just came up with oil change warning the other day. I'll be laying in the drive way tomorrow.  Just a heads up parts source has castrol jug 16.99 with free fram oil filter.
626610,glen,2011-09-30 21:21:00,2641,I change my wife's oil.   Walmart had oil for $10 for 5l. Less then $20 to change.
626633,mercman,2011-09-30 22:08:00,7054,"Ya mean i have to change the oil in my vehicules Dang, that answers a lot of questions"
626674,Burtess,2011-10-01 00:09:00,901, This is why I do mine myself as well.....  5L Pennzoil Platinum for $25 on sale + Napa Gold filter for $10..... when the stealership charges almost $100 for dexos1 synthetic oil change on my '11 Cruze..... and are you really sure they put the full synthetic in or just the blend????  Burt:)
626677,bigbuck,2011-10-01 00:14:00,2449,"That sounds about right. But seriously, an oil change on my car is pricey cuz she takes 8 litres of oil plus the filter. I usually buy the oil and filter and then have it done when I get repairs done."
626707,vinnimon,2011-10-01 01:33:00,2593,"Thats way too funny and somewhat true Its even worse and more embarrasing if your in that same trade.And neighbours coming by to chat or see what your up to splash, ouch!!!!"
626711,Terry,2011-10-01 01:49:00,14456,yeah went to one of those quick lube places as I am waiting I decide to ask for the second time  that they were putting in the right oil  oh yeah like we said we always use warranty approved oil ..  good can you tell me which oil that is  wrong..that is not the oil for my diesel liberty.............not even close....  so I do it myself...and know it is done right  and don't pick up the beer on the way
