Bass were all over the place: on the bottom, suspended 4' down over 20 FOW, and still hanging out on weebeds in 10-12 FOW. Weedbeds are dieing, but if there is green left, that is where the fish are. Gotta love it when you can throw topwater over 18' of water and get big smallies.  Here's a few for your viewing pleasure: 21""  19""  20""  big LM that a buddy caught "

I was surprised last Sunday at how many were roaming open areas with little to no weed cover  at all....but they would come from a long way to hit jerkbaits.  Water on the lake I was fished was super low....they actually put a log back in the dam a week prior because people weren't able to get their boats out"
626570,GBW,2011-09-30 18:23:00,8460,some nice fish there for sure!  love the colours.  oh and feel free to take water out of 4 ML as it's still high and my dad can't get the stone work at the lake done because of it.
626598,Jigger,2011-09-30 20:22:00,1237,"Nice going sd! Those are some pretty fall colours there! The trees are coming along too!  Low water in Haliburton, high water in the Kawarthas= par for the course. Should be great for this years crop of lakers..."
