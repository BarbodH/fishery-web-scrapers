626116,cwpowell,2011-09-29 03:48:00,265,"Hey guys, I just wanted to share with the fishermen who like bikes a picture of the bike I picked up today.  I welcome your comments and critisism.    "
626119,irishfield,2011-09-29 03:50:00,26272,Watch out for people turning left !!!  Very Very nice fella !  PS...gf isn't gonna like sitting on that luggage rack !
626122,smally21,2011-09-29 03:50:00,993,"my tastes lean more towards sportbikes, i ride an R1.  but that is a beauty! do you ride it or just look at it? should turn some heads!"
626124,cwpowell,2011-09-29 03:52:00,265,"Ha, the first thing she said was ""Are you nuts?"" The second thing was ""Well where am I going to sit?"""
626127,Miracon,2011-09-29 04:01:00,200, LMAO! Totaled my favorite bike from someone turning left! Pickup vs. me and my 450 Honda...the pickup won!  Very nice bike! Very jealous right now!
626134,adolson,2011-09-29 04:27:00,783,It looks like a green version of John's blue bike in the SAMCRO clubhouse!  /knowsnothingaboutbikesbutlovessonsofanarchy
626135,discophish,2011-09-29 04:33:00,392,"It's a little tricky getting past the mods on that bike, but if I can take a guess I would say that it started as an FXE.  A little out of the ordinary with the hard tail style seat on a lowrider, but it works with the stretched tank.  I may need to stuff myself with a few extra cheese burgers before I get my foot on that kicker!  I have the exact S&S carb on my bike.  You will love the fact that it's super easy to tune, one of the most tunable carbs on the market.  I've had the sport bikes as well, but the rumble on these bikes are like nothing else.  I love all classes of motorcycles.  Can I ask why you picked this particular bike over the rest?  Amazing bike!  Now all you need is a green life jacket and fish flames to go along with it!"
626212,John,2011-09-29 14:40:00,2956,"Very, very nice......"
626222,davis,2011-09-29 15:06:00,128,sweet!
626307,Ralph Field,2011-09-29 18:11:00,1018,Looks like a full custom job and not a stock bike . I think the green is rather unique.
626370,misfish,2011-09-29 20:38:00,29133,"The second thing was ""Well where am I going to sit?""  Theres a shirt to cover that.Just saying.   Nice ride,ya that green is sweet."
626372,Terry,2011-09-29 20:46:00,14456,not my favorite colour   but it is one sweet ride
626405,discophish,2011-09-29 23:29:00,392,"I'm not sure if this is a medical emergency or not, but I think someone slipped some acid into my drink just now.  I'm seeing flashes of your bike everywhere, including Terry's gif image.  I gotta go lay down for a bit.  Where the heck did my bed go?  This ain't my home!"
626407,discophish,2011-09-29 23:36:00,392,I'm seeing double now
626442,Rizzo,2011-09-30 01:18:00,4754," ...do you mean ""moustache rides 10 cents""  beauty bike by the way"
626454,Nipfisher,2011-09-30 01:49:00,2449,Now I have to give Terry my bike. Wait a minute....I don't own a bike.
626458,fish_fishburn,2011-09-30 02:08:00,1311,Nice bike dude. Looks like a wide glide front end? I like the colour by the way.
626476,highdrifter,2011-09-30 07:19:00,2534,NICE.  But if you're gonna ride a couch - why not stay at home..  Reminds me of a song...  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rli2mlB6OBg  cheers!
626579,cwpowell,2011-09-30 19:18:00,265,"Hey guys, not sure what she started out as, but the motor is a 66 shovelhead. I love the S&S carbs. The reason for me picking this bike was well...just look at it! Number 2 reason is the price was more than right. Disco Phish, no need for the kicker. She has an electronic ignition now. Just gotta push the buttton. She's a combo between new and old!  Thanks for all the comments guys."
626587,bigbuck,2011-09-30 19:45:00,2449,Nice looking machine!!! Enjoy it. I'm thinking about getting my bike licence and getting back on a bike. I rode as a kid and know every back road and trail from Newcastle to Port Hope and up in the Ganny.
626592,discophish,2011-09-30 20:09:00,392," It's not registered as an FXE?  Definitely a shovel, but looks like an S&S crank case though while keeping the original heads.  Hmm, if it has an electronic ignition, you should just go ahead and put a reverse gear in the tranny too!  <kidding>  Sweet bike.  Now go out and ride it and get off the computer!"
