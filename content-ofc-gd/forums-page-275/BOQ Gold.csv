Then last week I got a nice note from management to start taking days of before the end of the year.  Great! all summer they tell me not to take vacation but now the weather is crap they want me to start using it up.  What else to do this time of year then head up to BOQ and search for some BOQ Gold.  Boat was all packed, hotel all booked and ready to head up. Then I get the dreaded ""call"" sorry buddy can't make it something came up  Since I was going up alone,  Lloyd from U @ ME Guide Service is a good friend and is doing charters up there so I sent him a PM to see if he was around.  Always nice to know someone else on the water.  Talk about a lucky PM, Lloyd also had a last min cancallation but was taking 1 person out anyway and had some room.  Hummm let me think about this,,  take my boat out alone or go on a fully stocked charter boat.  No question U&ME it was.  Left my house at 3:00am to meet up at the dock for 6:30 am and off we went.  I will let the pictures show most of the results but it was a magical day on the water, Lloyd really knows his stuff and had us on the gold eye's early on.                     Day-2  The Original plan was just for me to head out on the U & Me charter for one day then use my boat for the next day and head out alone.  The forcast for winds was going to be crazyness   so lucky for me Lloyd had a cancallation.. He told me if its not bad in the morning we could go out and if it gets rough just come back in.  I thought with the rough weather coming the fish would be turned off and it would be just be a bumpy boat ride..  6:30am at the dock and light winds.. Again Lloyd did his magic and below is even a picture of him fishing.  Our crazy wind day            And I thought I had lot's of fishing stuff.. Lloyd is stocked and then some.      Then the winds hit around noon and we had to call it a DAY!!! "

814252,2 tone z71,2013-10-22 02:03:00,1311,Damm ...very nice think I'm gonna give Lloyd a call
814254,Christopheraaron,2013-10-22 02:15:00,3525,"Well done! BTW, is that a loose eyeball in the cooler?"
814273,Terry,2013-10-22 09:01:00,14456,I think it's the drain for the cooler
814275,Handlebarz,2013-10-22 09:39:00,3790,Very nice day out one of these days I will make the trip Down there
814277,wormdunker,2013-10-22 10:36:00,1711,Nice looking walters.  Thanx
814292,Christopheraaron,2013-10-22 14:27:00,3525,"It would appear that you're right, you've gotta admit it looks like an eyeball though!"
814293,Headhunter,2013-10-22 14:47:00,5703,"Well that report helped to light the fire for Pickereyes, that's for sure!!! Looks like you guys had most of the bay to yourselves as well! That would have been a blast! Thanks for posting! HH"
814321,fishnsled,2013-10-22 18:13:00,3520,"Very nice day out one of these days I will make the trip Down there  Yes you do Mike, just say when.    Lloyd certainly knows that water and it made for a great couple of days for you.  Very generous offer by him.  Nice report!"
814323,mike rousseau,2013-10-22 18:17:00,4661,Awesome...  You even got eaters in there... That can be tricky in quinte... Lol  I'm absolutely itching to get up there.... These reports aren't helping me wait till late November....  Thanks for the report....

814461,Moosebunk,2013-10-23 01:41:00,3970,Solid haul of gold for U&Me & you... Mr. Prospector.
814488,captpierre,2013-10-23 02:41:00,2521,"BOQ in the fall.  On my bucket list.  Just wondering, are those bigger girls OK to eat out of there?"
814515,Headhunter,2013-10-23 12:57:00,5703,"  Are they eatable, well yes, but after having tried both resident BOQ and migrating Lake O Pickereyes, I would suggest that you take a pic of your catch, head to your local fish monger and get something tasty. JMHO... HH"
814707,Stoty,2013-10-24 02:55:00,2910," No! Meat is chewy and yellowish from the ""big ones"". I won't keep anything over 5 lbs. 1) because the meat is MUCH better 2) the ""big"" girls are way too important to the declining fishery due to severe over-harvesting.  Let the big girls go!!!"
814732,fishindevil,2013-10-24 12:23:00,6254,Not to mention they eat oily alewives out in Lake Ontario and are very oily !!!!!!  No good !!!!! Let em go !!!! Take pics and memories .....
814771,captpierre,2013-10-24 16:29:00,2521,was  wondering about contaminants.
