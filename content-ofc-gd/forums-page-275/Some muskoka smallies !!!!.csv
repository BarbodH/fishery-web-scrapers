It was cold and almost rained all weekend long and the wind was strong as well and they are big lakes and blow up pretty good,but we got some very decent smallies as well I got 3 lake trout too !!! All fish were on the dropshot and the smallies wanted it very slow for sure !!!! Here is a few pics of the fish and some scenery as well  !!!! Tight-lines."

814203,chris.brock,2013-10-21 22:53:00,4053,"looks like you guys drop shotted the heck out of 'em, they look like Lake Erie sized smallies, very cool  the scenery pics make me want to get out of the city and back up north  bonus accidental lakers too, any size on the lakers?"
814206,Handlebarz,2013-10-21 23:14:00,3790,Gotta love the north for the great fall colors
814209,fishindevil,2013-10-21 23:41:00,6254,Almost all put smallies were deeper than 20ft and most came at 25-30ft !!!! And that's why I caught 3 accidental lakers too !!!! Deep flats were the ticket !!!!!
