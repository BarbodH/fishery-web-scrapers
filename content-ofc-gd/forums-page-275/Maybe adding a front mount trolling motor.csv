813556,DRIFTER_016,2013-10-18 20:01:00,10439,Keep in mind that you will need 2 batteries and you will really want an on-board charger to charge them up. I have this 3 bank model from CT that is made by a highly respected manufacturer (Schumacher electric) and has a 5 year warranty.  This is the Schumacher version http://www.batterychargers.com/ProductDetail.aspx?ProductName=94026916  And if you feel like checking out the manual  http://www.batterychargers.com/Documents/0099000777-01.pdf  And this is the rebranded Nautlius version @ CT FYI: wait for them to come on sale as they usually do a couple of times a year. Sale price is usually in the $125 range.  http://www.canadiantire.ca/AST/browse/4/Auto/3/Batteries/BatteryChargers/PRDOVR~0111521P/MotoMaster+Nautilus+15A+Onboard+Battery+Charger.jsp?locale=en

813562,lew,2013-10-18 20:16:00,12766,I always have two 12 volt batteries for my startup.Just incase .  You could do away with the  12 volt backup battery davey and use one of the deep cycles for an emergency start if needed. Just carry a set of jumper cables in the boat and your all set.

I love spending someone else's money. I priced the 80 pound thrust Minncotta 60 inch shaft with I Pilot, wireless, for you and it came out to around $1700.00. The receptacle, usually mounted against the hull interior should be installed where water entering won't be an issue, it should be mounted at 90 degrees. $300.00 for 2 good batteries. He said we, I mean you, will need an on board charger as the batteries will most likely be housed under the bow and difficult to access. It may not be a do it yourself mounting as there most likely isn't a flat spot on the bow and it needs to be on level as to deploy straight down, so mounting may be tricky.  You asked is it worth it? That's up to you now. If it isn't a must have I wouldn't unless a bowrider, then to spend that much bread it would have to be a must for me. It looks like a nice boat, what percentage of the retail price of the entire boat would this accessory be?

Thank you sir for thinking of me,really appreciate it. The boat I bought 6 years ago for a song,the trolling motor will be 90%the cost of the boat.The boat has run really well for the last 5 years.Had some issues when I bought it. Couldn't ask for a more stable and deep sided boat for the price IMO.I plan on keeping it for years to come. You now have me well over $2000.00 lol.I'm thinking used will have to be a option as I only use it for fun,but use it at least 20 weekends a year.

I wish they had I pilot then with anchor mode as that has to be killer to use.  One thing I like about the auto pilot is you can turn it on the point the motor where you want to go and it will keep you going in that direction. This is totally helpful when fishing with the family as I can help them out and not worry about where the boat is heading. It also has a long cord so I can operate the boat from the back and let others fish up front.  Give angling outfitters a call as I got mine there for the same price as the USA you never know he might ha e good uses units.

813624,Handlebarz,2013-10-19 00:30:00,3790,I am just using the biggest deep cycle batteries from Walmart for my 24v system.

Just bring them back with or with out receipt and get your discount usually $30-$40 which helps on a $80-$90 battery

I have been on ebay and Kijiji and haven't seen any for that price tonight. I have seen some transom mounted 12V units with short shafts for around 500  but nothing like that described at that price.

813642,John Bacon,2013-10-19 03:49:00,3277,they usually last three seasons then hard to hold a long charge.  You should be able to get more than three years from a battery.  Keep them charged and check the water levels.  Distilled water is best if they need to be topped up; but tap or lake water is probably better than not have adequate water levels.  The sooner you can charge them after using them the better.

I find it underpowered at 55 pounds and 24 volt for my 19' deep ""V"". Any wind and I'm concentrating on working the thing not fishing. It's always windy most days out here.

Plenty of options fishingwise where it is useful.  On your boat I would want at least an 80# and would want wireless as well. Another big plus is autopilot like the Minnkota I have has. A lot less messing around trying to keep your boat going where you want it without having to constantly babysit it.  You're looking at some $$$$ though. My motor is a Minnkota powerdrive version I with auto pilot and I added the co-pilot wireless accessory.  I would love one of the ipilot models though.

I have a terrova with I pilot and love it but they are expensive.  Your next option for cheep would be the powerdrive with basic foot pedal. Because it is electric steer, the cable is about 20 feet long and can be put almost anywhere on the boat. The terrova is the same but has a better designed foot pedal. Both motors can function with the copilot as well which would give you your remote should you want it."

A good buddy of mine also bought a used 70lb 24V PD from a member here, and its been great for 2 seasons now.  Generally, if something goes wrong, its in the footpedal, and you can replace them for less than $100.  I couldn't fish without mine. The best part is being able to operate it from anywhere in the boat with one foot. I use the continuous setting almost always, whether I'm slow trolling, or working a weedline. Great for keeping on course while drifting too.  I'll tell you one thing, once you have one, you will wonder how you ever fished without one!! Its the best tool on my boat. I'd rather have no graph than no bowmount!  I'd say find a used one from a member here, and giver a whirl. Its really hard to wreck one. I've never even heard of one flat out quitting.  S."
