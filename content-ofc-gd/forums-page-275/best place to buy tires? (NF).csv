814142,Canuck2fan,2013-10-21 15:36:00,1444,"When I install tires on aluminum rims I take the time to power wire brush the bead area and paint the surface. This helps prevent corrosion that causes these leaks and also helps to seal the tire to the rim. I don't get comebacks, even after several years.   It can be done right as the second shop's work showed. What got me was I had to wait for the tires I had ordered to come in so when they got there to the shop it was about 10min to close and they wouldn't let me go out and see the work being done which I always like to do... I was a little suspicious of how fast they got the work done. Lesson learned though I won't darken their door with my cash again."

They then drive me home, so I can get back to work, and a few hours later they deliver my car or truck when they're done!

Just like everything else you need to know your prices before buying but I can tell you, there are a lot of items where you can save significant amounts of money. I order lots of things and have them shipped to a US postal box and without doubt save money. The trip down(30-40mins for me) is paid for when I fill my truck, buy a 30 pack of Molson for $18, and a few groceries like a couple gallons of milk for $2 each. THEN I pick up the stuff I ordered at 30-50% cheaper than in Canada. I bring back $50-$250 regularly and had to go in and pay the taxes only once."

814441,Canuck2fan,2013-10-23 01:01:00,1444,+1 when I was in Vegas a few years back I was on my way to check out a walmart in a seedy area of town.... (I like to see the real US of A when I go south) So I like to go to a Krogers or Walmart. I knew it was the right walmart because the  concierge who gave me the GPS co-ordinates at the hotel said if I wasn't back in an hour he was going to notify my next of kin. So on the way I saw a sign that said NEW TIRE  and INSTALATION 27.00...  I was going to stop and check it out but I had that deadline and had to be back in an hour LOL The best part was the place looked newish and was doing tire changes. It was between a Lawyer offering to beat a DUI for 199.00 (not Saul) and a pawn shop (not the one) that offered immediate title loans on your car when the lawyer couldn't get you off I guess.  I was intrigued because the best I could do on just installation here just before I left was 20.00 bucks a tire. So a $7.00ish NEW tire would have been something to see.
814801,Roe Bag,2013-10-24 19:16:00,246,"Canadian Tire always seems to have a 4 tires for the price of 3 deal going.  The deal seems to be on-going, but the specific tires that it is offered on change from week to week.  If you can afford to wait a bit, then I would just keep checking with Canadian Tire until the have a 4 for 3 deal on one of the tires that will suit your needs. My own personal experience with Canadian Tire has not been good. I too was attracted to the buy three and get the fourth free. Recently a noise developed in my SUV. It has progressively gotten worse. Yesterday my wife and I made a three hour round trip to London. At 110 K the noise was frightening. Being surrounded by 18 wheelers was of even greater concern. Today I went to my local mechanic. The problem is in the tires. Three of four belts have shifted causing not only a vibration but a ""wha wha"" sound that couldn't be readily traced as it is both fronts and the right rear. Apparently there is still 50 -60 % tread left on the tires (less than three years old). Yet, they are basically junk. Around the rim edge, in close proximity to the bead, cracks can be seen on all four tires. Another indication of old rubber drying out .According to my mechanic this model of Cooper Tire was discontinued some five years ago. I purchased them from CTC about two and a half years ago. Canadian Tire buys up left over stock and clears them with such offers. The problem is this left over stock has been sitting in a warehouse for God knows how long. Over time as the rubber dries out, it is prone to cracks, less control and poorer traction. I guess the moral of the story is ""if it seems like a really good deal, it probably isn't."" Hope this helps."

Hope this helps.  Good point about age of a 'new tire'.  My tires show 2011 which is the year I bought them from Canadian Tire.  My 8.5 year old spare does not have any cracks.  Obviously CTC should not be selling 3+ plus year old tires as new.  However, I wouldn't expect those issues even if the tire was a few years old; at least not if it is stored indoors.  Unless those tires are much more than 5 years old, or stored in extreme conditions, I would think the problem was more to do with a manufacturing defect than the age of the tire."

813753,ch312,2013-10-19 16:36:00,1590,"Cross border  Yep. Buy the tires on Tirerack where they have each tire reviewed and rated and is by far the best website when you're tire shopping. Then have them shipped to an installer (they accept and hold the tires for free until you arrive) just across the border and drive down to have them installed. We used and were very happy with Pep Boys.  Even on the little tires for the corolla we saved a few hundred dollars. The total US price with tires, installation, gas, lunch, dinner, a few bags of groceries and a couple cases of beer included was lower than just the tires alone in Ontario. Hard to keep my money in Canada when I can go to the US and get the exact same product and all that food and beer for less.

813810,Woodsman,2013-10-19 21:33:00,1286,I've done best at my local tire shop in St. Marys. Check out your local shop for a price. Don't forget to include all the extras many places pile on.

Be sure and take advantage of the rebates currently being offered by most manufacturers.  Redflagdeals.com will have current listings of sales on tires, and anything else on sale in Canada or the US, just use the search function on the website.  tiretrends.com have a canadian division  tirerack.com as mentioned usually is more than competitive with anyone else  Costco.com is cheaper than Costco.ca but you do have to order over the phone and drive across to have them installed but are fully warrantied in Canada with no issues.  1010tires.com another Canadian site."
