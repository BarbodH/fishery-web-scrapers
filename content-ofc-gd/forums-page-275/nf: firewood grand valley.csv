814311,DRIFTER_016,2013-10-22 17:06:00,10439,We used to get our firewood from a flooring mill in the Belwood area. They deliver and it's all kiln dried hardwood flooring off cuts. A lot of little stuff but it burns well and is cheap. I think they were charging under $100 for a truck load delivered to our place up by the marsh. We made a bin lined with chicken wire to hold the wood and just tossed it in the bin. No stacking needed.

I should be good for winter now. Have a good stack of maple from last year ready to go too.  No clue about a supplier in your area, sorry.  S."
