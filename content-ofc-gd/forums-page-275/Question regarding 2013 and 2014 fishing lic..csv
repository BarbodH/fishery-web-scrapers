Or a discount added being so late in the season. I'm guessing probably not, but figured I'd ask. She's interested or should i say I've convinced her to go fishing this weekend coming. Just like to know. Thanks."
814262,Nipfisher,2013-10-22 03:46:00,2449,"No. The 2013 One year licence is in effect from January 1, 2013 to December 31, 2013.  You can however purchase 1 day sport fishing licence for her for $12.95."
814264,Bondar,2013-10-22 04:13:00,817,"I think the conservation license is like $18 as well Starting in February New York license will go for a year from the purchase date, hopefully Ontario will follow soon after"

For us guys buying year to year,Jan 1st fishing would be possible  then."

You may have some explaining to doooooooooo lol.If your stopped.Just hate the red tape crap.Must be a problem Brian,they never take over a few weeks at most in my experiance."
814390,kickingfrog,2013-10-22 22:47:00,8333,"I went the ""service"" Ontario building in Barrie this summer to get/add a small game tag to my existing 3 year fishing card which expires at the end of this year. I asked if it was possible to buy a new 3 year fishing/small game card and was told ""No"". No big deal I just hoped to avoid getting a new card in 5 months. I did get dinged for another $6 for a new plastic card thoughâ€¦ and will have to pay another $6 in December. That kind of burned my berries."
814395,John Bacon,2013-10-22 23:06:00,3277,"I remember when they first brought dinged us with the $6/card charge... It occurred when they went from paper to plastic cards.  We were told that the charge was to pay for a more efficient system???  It the system is more efficient, why do we have to pay extra for it?"
814397,kickingfrog,2013-10-22 23:13:00,8333,"The more ""efficient"" system was in regards to the efficiency that money left our pockets."
