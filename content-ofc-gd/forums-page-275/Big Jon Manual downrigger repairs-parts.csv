815056,Fisherpete,2013-10-25 22:46:00,1814,Can anyone tell me the best place around the GTA to pick up replacement parts or have repairs done on a Big Jon manual rigger?I'll post a pic of what I messed up later tonight - broke the end off the clutch assembly. Hope it can be fixed or else I now have a pile of spare parts. Pic had been added.   ThanksPete

815064,Fisherpete,2013-10-25 23:39:00,1814,Yeah I tried that... The clutch discs are there but not the rod that they go on. I think it may be a goner - let me get that pic up to show what happened.
815065,fishindevil,2013-10-25 23:49:00,6254,Hey Pete I think tightlines  in Pickering still carries big Jon ?? Try them I'm not 100% sure ??? Give it a shot

815179,Fisherpete,2013-10-26 17:45:00,1814,"fishindevil & Steve - thanks for the suggestions, I will try them.  I managed to remove the broken part from the tower - hopefully it is still available somewhere. I still don't understand how those clutch washers are to be removed though...    Pete"
