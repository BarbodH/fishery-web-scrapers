My buddy got into a nice one on the Buckhorn side of Gannons Narrows. We caught it trolling with a spinnerbait and trailer tail. We got the action recorded on his Gopro, but I forgot to take a still with my camera. We were more interested in getting it back in the water as we left the net behind and used the boca grip instead. The fish was a mid-40's and no sign of any others. We both discussed it and will probably not leave the net behind next time; it does take up a lot of room in the boat though. My only luck was a hungry bass that liked a big lure. "

814403,captpierre,2013-10-22 23:36:00,2521,I put in about 6 hrs this weekend in the northeast end.  Nada.  Water clear.  58 degrees.  Trolled and cast weedbeds/edges
