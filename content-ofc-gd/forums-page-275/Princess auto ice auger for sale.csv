You know the drill (no pun intended) it was the Dixie Rd. location, just south of Derry Rd Mississauga. Here's a pic I snapped. Price seems decent.  looks like they only had the one. Just lettin you guys know."
815289,Woodsman,2013-10-27 09:25:00,1286,I have one bought new at Canadian Tire on sale for $249 a couple years ago. They were also on sale last year for the same price. They are a rebranded Eskimo auger.

My buddy bought one last year and the first day the throttle trigger broke on it (crap plastic) but other than that it worked ok for the season.  Burt"
