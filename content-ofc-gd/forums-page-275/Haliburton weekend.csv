814409,Gallie,2013-10-22 23:54:00,1215,"Went up to haliburton to try get a couple skis over the weekend. We rented a cabin at kashaga lodge and 4 of us went. Two of the guys have never caught a muskie and my boat partner had one out canning. Sat. We headed down kash to canning while casting and trolling the whole way. My buddy caught a nice smallmouth in east kash. Next while trolling canning over a shallow weed bed i had my big storm dbl jointed hit weeds so i gave a good yank, the line wrapped around my rod tip and as i was unwinding it a massive ski hit the bait and came right out of the water. Unfortunately the bait flew away from his mouth and he was gone. Later in the day we met up with a buddy of ours with a cottage up there completely at random. Long story short he was trying to take a leak out the back of his tinny when it took a big gulp of water and swamped. So we dragged it to shore drained it and towed him back to his cottage, by then it was near dark so we did the mission back to our cabin. The other boat had managed about an 8 pound muskie trolling a mepps. Sun we stayed in kash and fished the entire east lake. My buddy got two muskie both on a spinnerbait and both in the 4-6 lb range. I had a 40+ incher follow me up but of course i forgot to figure eight for the first time in 100 casts and as soon as i pulled the vibrax out i saw it and he bounced. Monday we woke up late due to possible over consumption( possible) fished a few hours for naught and headed home. It rained it was windy it was cold i caught nothing and had a great time doin it. I will be back.P.s. Posting pics takes me a while ill hopefully have them up shortly"
