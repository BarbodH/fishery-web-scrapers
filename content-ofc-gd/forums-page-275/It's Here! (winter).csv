814806,Roe Bag,2013-10-24 19:24:00,246,I was up on the Saugeen (Southapton Ontario) last week.  Arrived at first light to find about an inch of snow on the ground. Burned off in a couple of hours. I'm sure there will be lots more to come in the not too distant future.
814808,aplumma,2013-10-24 19:25:00,6896," It'll get really scary if you zoom out, Art. O.K. I did it and you are correct. Some days a little knowledge is a scary thing bud.    Art"

Cheers'  Curt Raf posted a good how-to link.  I started stacking a drying my wood this August (standing dead and fresh) and I'm happy and releaved how dry it is. Burns great; in holz hausen I trust.   that birch will be nice in the stove and nice bunch of chopping blocks. mine disintegrated lol I can thank a beaver for dropping several BIG white birch near one of the ponds. That stuff was essentially pre-seasoned in the field for me. I have a good mix of maple, oak, poplar, ash, yellow and white birch. I'm already collecting for next year."
