I was hoping to get one more trip in but the bottom fell out of the thermometer today and the open water season came to a screaming halt.  Current temp is -10 and dropping and the smaller lakes in town are icing up already. Should be drilling holes in a couple of weeks though. Gives me just enough time to get my ice gear in order."

But I guess it can only last so long before winter takes it's grip.How much sunlight do you have now?   The water temps have dropped a lot here in the last few days too.May get a couple more weeks of travel before I give mine the lift out.It will be a couple of months before the shacks appear here."
