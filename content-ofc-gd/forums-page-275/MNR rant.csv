814169,jimmer,2013-10-21 19:23:00,2730,"As I mentioned before the bigger threat in the Kawarthas is habitat destruction NOT OVER HARVESTING-thats why your not getting stopped. CO's are checking out compliance issues with construction etc As anglers its irksome and is optically bad but as someone who's seen entire fisheries wiped out due to habitat destruction I'd rather the few dollars MNR has in Southern Ontario be spent on this. Poachers suck but you gotta choose your battles. Sorry, I can't agee 100% with you. Over harvesting is an issue in the kawarthas as well as habitat destruction and if the MNR's main focus is habitat, they are not doing very well with that. You just have to drive around the lakes and see how many huge homes are being built while sanitizing their waterfront with poured concrete or large limestone rock. How do they get away with that? Is it the almight buck that buys their way past building codes? Just my opinion and thoughts though."

They have always been polite asked me how my vacation is going and then a check for license and equipment and any fish in the boat. I keep one or two pike for the fish fry but other than that they all go back into the water. Most of the fishing I do is in resort areas so I try to leave as many good fish for the next vacationer to catch as I can. The lodge owner appreciate it and it keeps us going back year after year.

Impossible to control cause there are more of us than there are of them. Simple math.  Fired an email off to Charles Sousa (Liebel-erals) with a proposal for funding the MNR along with some choice words on how that corrupt band of theiving asses at the legislature he breaks bread with should be ashamed of themselves for how they have gutted Ontario and will have to pay the piper on the next go around simply considering the fact that as anglers and hunters we are Millions strong and span the demographic spectrum.   Proposal? All monies collected from fiahing and hunting licences as well as a potion of tax tied to all things related to both sports be used solely for the MNR instead of a slush fund for bribes and gifts and other useless ventures they are well known for. Simple enough right?   Their response? Same old song and thank you for voicing your concern dance. Can't wait to see to see if they burn in the same infernal hell the Federal Reds are mired in right now. Stay tuned.

814278,aplumma,2013-10-22 11:35:00,6896,Down South they are known as DNR or department of natural resources. For years we had a club on the river that we could set up picnics and etc to make it a real comfortable place for the summer. The DNR would swing by to talk and check a few of the jet skis or boats on the launch. As time went on they started to tell a few of us in the club when they saw someone in the jetski community break a rule and ask us to make it stop before they had to write tickets. This was the turning point where we all respected and understood each other. They would come over when ever they wanted and food and drink were always offered to them no matter who was down at the club. Don't get me wrong they did have a job and they did do there job when needed and wrote tickets to some of the club members when we got stupid but it never felt like they had a grudge. Time passed and three years later they got reassigned and the next DNR  crew rolled in and started off with a meeting with the club to assure us that things would remain the same. The good news was the old officers bought jetskis and joined the club. Uniformed or not if you take time to see the person you will find usually they are just as nice as you are to them.   Art

It is understood though that there are always gonna be a percentage that aren't nice to deal with, and that's just life.

X2 I have never been stopped by the MNR on the kawartha lakes in my years of fishing, just an occasional OPP checking for alcohol and that boating regs are being met, they didn't even ask for a fishing license when it was quite evident that was all we were doing. This year while fishing a tournament a boat sneaked up on us, and I remember saying to my buddy "" finally in all these years  were gunna be checked out,"" which despite being in a tourney I was happy to do. So this MNR boat pulls up and says "" excuse me do you have time for a survey?"" I remember laughing in my head. Really? So I obliged did the survey with out missing a cast, not a request for a license or checking possession limits  happened. I want to see more CO's around, if everybody is playing by the rules, then nobody has anything to worry about. But I see people all the time breaking the rules and breaking them in large proportions. I have called the hotlines and even tried approaching people with education on what they are doing is wrong, but almost everyone I did approach knew the rules and were choosing to break them. I wish they had the ""reserves"" for CO's, just like volunteer firemen,who cared enough about the fishery to work on their own time wage free, and check a couple boats out, if they found violators contact with CO is made and dealt with. Kinda like neighbourhood watch for the fish. lol  Anyways I know this would never happen, so no need for the comments poking loop holes in my theory.

The ones that get me the most are when someone keeps a walleye outside of the slot and couldn't give a crap when approached by a concerned angler to educate them. The future of some of our lakes doesn't look good. I would like to see the MNR waste some of their money in the Kawarthas.

Also had them check a couple of boats from our group and our cabin (while we weren't there) on a flyin north of Armstrong one year, I wasn't one of them that got check but I did hear and see the plane. I've also been stopped twice on the road, one of them was a road block set up coming from the Red Lake Area, CO didn't believe me when I stated I had no fish and proceed to check everything in my truck, he was nice enough but I could tell he may have been disappointed.  This ""TOURIST"" follows the rules"
814147,Bernie,2013-10-21 16:24:00,3190,"My experience is very similar to Lews. I cannot recall ever being checked by a CO when fishing or hunting and its been 40 years since I got my hunting licence.I have had the creel cencus boat come in a couple times, but they don't ask for anything other than fish numbers and species."
814150,Terry,2013-10-21 17:32:00,14456,It must be me. 4 times hunting and countless times fishing  I got stop 7 times on a long weekend and 5 of 7 stops had both NMR and police  while fishing
814151,Musky or Specks,2013-10-21 17:36:00,2710,As I mentioned before the bigger threat in the Kawarthas is habitat destruction NOT OVER HARVESTING-thats why your not getting stopped. CO's are checking out compliance issues with construction etc As anglers its irksome and is optically bad but as someone who's seen entire fisheries wiped out due to habitat destruction I'd rather the few dollars MNR has in Southern Ontario be spent on this. Poachers suck but you gotta choose your battles.
814156,JoshS,2013-10-21 17:54:00,729,"I fish the kawartha's quite a bit and have only been stopped once, it was on a less-popular lake on a rainy wednesday afternoon. I was the only boat out there all day, besides the CO's who were ""disguised"" in a fishing boat. After they checked my license and asked me a few questions, they told me they were watching me from a distance with binoculars for awhile? I remember thinking, what a waste of time that was. They were on the lake for hours and I was the only boat. They could of been elsewhere. I understand they have to do their checks on lakes but they should have made the call to go check some other areas that day as well.  Edit: Not in the boat I've been stopped a few times in the region, either night fishing for walleye and once they were setup at a 4way stop on hwy 36 checking cars. Some of the groups that fish the dams in the kawartha's pay no mind to slots (and garbage cans  :wallbash:  ), nice to see CO's there."
814159,Dontcryformejanhrdina,2013-10-21 18:18:00,535,"I got checked once this year, a couple of years ago I had an MNR officer pull into the driveway and ask me what I caught when I was bringing my rods down to my truck from the house, I hadn't even left to go fishing yet lol. Also had MNR officers stop and talk to me once or twice when I was a kid. Never had them screaming at me or jumping out of bushes haha, they were always polite, just asking me what I caught/how the fishing was, checked licences, etc.."
813937,wantabigone,2013-10-20 15:09:00,97,"I just wanted to post how dissappointed I am with the way the MNR is being run. I personally had an experience this year on a fly-in lake that on our last day the MNR flew into the lake to check on our possession limits.  Really? That is the most productive way to spend our tax dollars (and licensing fees)? The cost of renting the plane, pilot, fuel and 3 officers. This is all to ensure that we and others on these lakes are not ""overfishing"" these lakes. Seriously?  If they want to ensure those that do flyins are not keeping more than their limits then park on the logging roads outside of the float plane operators and check the vehicles as they leave or at the float plane location itself. Just an FYI- we were fine with our limits. This is just a ridiculous way to spend our money. These guys just want to enjoy a week in the bush for free doing some fishing of their own and stopping along the way at some lakes to justify what they are doing.  I have seen at least one other post stating that they too had MNR visit them by float plane. This was at a different time of year- what a waste of money.  Then we have a post that a fish ladder was built but it was not built to accomodate larger fish. (I assume chinook) Really? The MNR decides to build a fish ladder but only designs it to fit certain fish? Another example of foolish financial decisions.  I am sure the officers are doing their best and are likely frustrated as well but upper amangement is doing a terrible job.  All in my opinion."
813942,Terry,2013-10-20 15:18:00,14456,"yup, that is the mnr logic , get the lest bang for the buck  at my fly-in they traveled mnr trails then canoed  to our camp and hide for two hours till we returned  then they came running out at us yelling, I picked up a machete, as they were in plain clothes  and I nthought we were under attack  as they got closer I heard them yelling mnr if I had a rifle  with me I do believe I would have shot them out of fear.....before I could hear mnr  was what they were yelling  of course they  found nothing wrong and left in the dark and the rain to paddle out ...morons"
813943,glen,2013-10-20 15:18:00,2641,I wonder how long they where at your camp?   How many camps did they hit that day?  Takes away from a fly in to have then showing up and wasting your time.
813945,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2013-10-20 15:19:00,0,"for 20 years the libs and cons have been defunding the mnr.  this anemic organization has no teeth, and more and more represents the remote tourism industry as opposed to the crown.  vote different or expect the status quo.  personally i have no problem with the mnr doing fly in checks.   not everyone is responsible like yourself when presented with the opportunity to catch a lot of fish."
813947,BillM,2013-10-20 15:22:00,17367,Terrys story is hilarious!!!  LOL!!!   So many violations happening close to home (ie on all the east ditches during salmon season) but these guys would rather spend $$$$ flying into remote camps?    I must be missing something here.
813948,Terry,2013-10-20 15:22:00,14456,if they knew where and when the plane brings the guests back to base camp would be a  much better use or resources
813949,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2013-10-20 15:24:00,0,"given that so many anglers are fairly honest and law abiding, the mnr has taken it upon themselves to focus on catching anglers in the act of egregious acts like enjoying a beer while fishing.   definitely a large waste of money on a fly in lake. lol!"
813953,Ralph Field,2013-10-20 15:32:00,1018,"They don't get to go out of the office much, so I fly in is a nice field trip."
813954,ChasinTails,2013-10-20 15:33:00,90,spend that money and fine snaggers and loogans out east seriously
813960,Musky or Specks,2013-10-20 16:00:00,2710,"You have to understand that different areas have different priorities. The CO's your dealing with on a flyin trip aren't from southern Ontario they are stationed up there. The biggest threat to fish stocks in the north is over harvest Read about how many time this happens and they find ridiculous amounts of fish that Flyin/Remote access anglers have been caught with. They are not just targeting you. They are on a milk run looking for violations that range from over harvest to shoreline alteration to hunting/netting.Those CO's might only get to that camp once a month and are responsible for a huge area. In southern Ontario the priority is habitat destruction Manpower because of budget cuts is reduced and angler violations are just not as big of a threat in this part of Ontario as making sure the habitat doesn't get destroyed by builders,home owners,contractors. For bang for the buck ,snaggers/illegal fisherman just aren't a big enough threat to the fishery when compared with habitat destruction. Optically it looks bad but fish populations can always rebound if there is habitat to live/reproduce. If there is no habitat THERE IS NO FISH!!!! Which would you rather see ?"
813962,wantabigone,2013-10-20 16:07:00,97,They were not concerned about the habitat at all- they were only targetting fisherman on the lake. If they were concerned about the habitat as you mentioned then they would not have motored around the lake in their plane going to each boat and checking if we had any fish in our posession and then checking the fridge and freezer for fish. This lengthy stop had NOTHING at all to do with habitat concern. (by habitat I am referring to shoreline reshaping etc).

813965,wantabigone,2013-10-20 16:26:00,97,"Hey righteous one...  You wrote ""They are on a milk run looking for violations that range from over harvest to shoreline alteration to hunting/netting""  Just sayin'  Just poking fun at you now. Guess I read just fine.  I am not feeling persecuted - as I clearly stated I am of the opinion that using a float plane to monitor remote lake overharvesting is a waste of money. It would be better to station outside of the float plane operators site and monitor the outgoing parties as they load up their vehicles. Much cheaper."
813967,Musky or Specks,2013-10-20 16:44:00,2710,"Not righteous just balanced and seeing things from both sidesYou and everyone else complained about the waste of money and I clearly explained that poaching is a large concern for nrothern CO's..Shoreline alteration is construction(Read lodge docks and cottages) not moving a plane around a lake. They are concerned with nailing poachers which you could have been. When they take the time to land they are going to check for any and all violations they might find because of the expense. They were justified in checking you out I have no problem with the ""expense"". Our CO's can't seem to win here. Check guys out,if it's you, you complain, don't check guys, you complain. That's my complaint! All anglers need to understand that CO's can't be everywhere at once and so when they stop you they have to check everything because that's how their performance at work is judged. Supervisors see results- X amount of stops made, X omount of charges,X amount of convictions."

To be clear, I am not complaining about being stopped and checked- I am complaining on the cost of having been stopped and checked. Check my party out when I arrive at the float plane operator. Just as effective and much more cost effective."

They are currently worth about 1.7 million each.  They're gonna burn kerosene somewhere, so it may as well be the north. The airplane(s) is(are) on standby for back lake creel studies, as well as many other uses all season anyhow (including hauling firefighters), so they may as well use it to catch a few that are eating their possession limit at lunch and another in the evening from time to time. Being checked, politely and properly (not ambushed like Terry was), really isn't a big deal is it...when it's all about protecting our resource and you have nothing to hide because you are following the regulations. Now if they're only interested in finding a beer can in your boat... when you are on a back lake.. . then their agenda is seriously flawed."
