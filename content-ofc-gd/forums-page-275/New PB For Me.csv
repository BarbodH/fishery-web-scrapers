814525,mattyk,2013-10-23 14:50:00,2110,Nice looking fish!
814536,Joeytier,2013-10-23 15:35:00,3990,Looks like a rezzy?  If so thats an absolute monster.  Congrats
814537,Musky or Specks,2013-10-23 15:39:00,2710,Looks like a rezzy? If so thats an absolute monster. Congrats A lot of the streams in Rich's area have resident fish right down to the lake and you catch them while steelhead fishing. BTW When I see a thread from Rich that says new PB I've just got to come and check it out. Nice fish Rich!!
814615,Steve,2013-10-23 22:18:00,2075,"not saying that ISN'T a resident fish, however, we have caught dozens of browns with those spawning colours, out of Lake Ontario, which certainly aren't resident fish.  both males and females get that dark spawning colour when in the rivers.  great fish rich!"

I agree but this is a Lake Erie trib not exacxtly known for its open water brown trout fishery although US does stock a crap load of them"
814645,Rich,2013-10-23 23:55:00,3927,I'm pretty sure it was a lake run fish guys. There's usually carp and largemouth sitting where he was in the summer. There are resident browns but really the way the creek gets decimated there aren't many. I'm not saying it wasn't .. but it's a pretty fat chance on this particular stream.  Thank you all for the kind words.
814160,Rich,2013-10-21 18:35:00,3927,"The biggest trib brown ive ever landed, not big by many standards but a nice step in the right direction for me! Caught bottom bouncing bow skein, erie trib.  "
814164,jimmer,2013-10-21 19:07:00,2730,"Wow, nice fish. It even has a unique spot pattern to it."
814167,walleye_man,2013-10-21 19:21:00,135,crazy patterning on that fish! congrats
814172,misfish,2013-10-21 19:52:00,29133,"Ya,not your normal brown trout spot pattern.  Nice fish and congrats Rich."
814173,aplumma,2013-10-21 19:52:00,6896,I wouldn't know a trout if Doc Sal slapped me up side the head with it. That though I bet is a prime example of a good trout nice catch.   Art
814179,Richie Razor,2013-10-21 20:17:00,536,Ummmm that's an Atlantic.
814182,Christopheraaron,2013-10-21 20:32:00,3525,"Hmmm, I see where you're coming from but there's no doubt in my mind that's a beautiful brown."
814183,Rich,2013-10-21 20:35:00,3927,"Definitely not an atlantic, it was caught the same spot where I caught three other (smaller, MUCH smaller) browns that evening. I wish it was, though I have caught an atlantic from an Erie trib in the past. It was a much different build than this fish, the colors were indeed similar though.  Thanks everyone! I have seen bigger ones around so I am hoping to crush this PB this fall!"
814184,Terry,2013-10-21 20:37:00,14456,nice fish
814185,davey buoy,2013-10-21 20:40:00,5505,"WTG Rich,really nice fish!!"
814187,Handlebarz,2013-10-21 20:52:00,3790,Nice going Rich they have great colors
814190,fishnsled,2013-10-21 20:59:00,3520,Great looking fish Rich!!  Congrats!
814192,Joey,2013-10-21 21:19:00,9122,"Wow, nice Rich!"
814195,ChasinTails,2013-10-21 21:41:00,90,"wow nice brown, i saw some dude accidentally snag a massive brown with a similar pattern"
814211,nancur373,2013-10-21 23:52:00,1211,beaut
814224,dave524,2013-10-22 00:26:00,4508,"Not an Atlantic . Those spots though are more like a resident than a lake run fish though, great fish."
814225,Richie Razor,2013-10-22 00:29:00,536,"Althought I think it really looks like an Atlantic, it's a beauty hen. Did you harvest those eggs? Best roe on the river any given day brown roe is."
814228,dave524,2013-10-22 00:42:00,4508,"Althought I think it really looks like an Atlantic, it's a beauty hen. Did you harvest those eggs? Best roe on the river any given day brown roe is.  Don't look at the spots, look at the relationship of the rear of the jaw and the eye. Browns are like largemouth and Atlantics are like smallies."
814233,BillM,2013-10-22 01:04:00,17367,"Ummmm that's an Atlantic.  Nope, that's a brown.  Look at the tail.   Some browns have really spaced out spots like that.   Nice fish Rich!!!!"
814238,wildeye rainbow,2013-10-22 01:18:00,123,very nice brown!  I hope to get one a trib if this rain ever stops and the water levels recede a bit  WR
814242,moxie,2013-10-22 01:29:00,1566,Haven't caught a Brown in quite a while. Congrats on the pb Rich.
814258,FISHEYEZ,2013-10-22 02:50:00,49,Very nice fish man!
814314,ehg,2013-10-22 17:31:00,2666,"The biggest trib brown ive ever landed, not big by many standards but a nice step in the right direction for me! Caught bottom bouncing bow skein, erie trib.    That is a great brown trout!  Kinda has an old world Europe look to it, Maybe it spent whole life in river, like a resident fish.  The browns from Lake O  i caught in past had a chrome look to them,  having spent their lives out in big lake.  Good stuff"
814316,NANUK,2013-10-22 17:49:00,797,A very nice brown indeed !!! Congrats on your PB Rich .
814504,fishindevil,2013-10-23 07:52:00,6254,Awesome brown rich !!!! Amazing color too !!!! Congrats on your PB !!!!!
