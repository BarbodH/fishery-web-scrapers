There are days where the pike are crazy active, seemingly in schools - but those are few and far between, they seem to be any time there is a light rain or just before dark.  My question is. Since most of the time it's slow and pike are (seem) scattered, what types of areas should be likely to hold them? The ponds I fish are no more than 20 feet deep and the fish are not in the deep zones, seemingly.  Any help would be appreciated!"
815077,timmeh,2013-10-26 00:34:00,609,Any inflows into the ponds? Particularly man made inflows tend to have higher water temps.
815117,fishindevil,2013-10-26 12:12:00,6254,2 weeks ago while smallmouth bass fishing my buddy and myself caught 4 pike and they were waiting in ambush spots along drop offs and on the outside edges of the last remaining weeds at the drop offs !!!!!  And 1 of those was very near the inflowing current if there is any where you are fishing try those spots !! But you said ponds so not sure but give it a shot if there's any drop off spots.
