Resists tangle and hassles.   It,s both for open and close face,and a monofilament..  Im pretty much very satisfied with the new line. It,s smooth casting and very limp.It dosent spring off the reel,which is nice.  I filled two ultra light spools with it,and have enough left to use as leader line for the river. Bonus. 6pd 250 yards.    Anyone else try it?"
