I figured I could grab it for him and drop it off at my parents place and he could make the short trip down to pick it up,but said frig it,I got to meet this fella. So up at 5am this morning, on the road by 5:20. The drive was good til I got to Katrine. I made a quick stop to see the parents before they were off to be with my brother. When I left,the snow starts flying. Sure glad I put the snows on Tuesday. A bit of a white knuckle drive the rest of the way up.         Met up with Bernie and his son. Like I have said many times on this board,you cant judge anyone until you meet them in person. Well I never judged Bernie,Always thought he was a stand up guy,and I wasnt wrong. He is just like one of the byes. What a super nice guy. After a brief chat,showing me his shop, I wanted to get back on the road home the way the weather was was. Offer to show my the boat factory,but I said another time. Maybe on one of those weekend at Bernies  ,which he asked me to attend next year. Thanks for the offer Bernie.  Glad I left when I did,the ride was just the same,until I got past Katrine.     Nice to meet you sir and your son.  Another off the list."

The ride up and back,was lets say,meet  new friends,and time to reflect some memories. Ya that will do. Two birds with one stone.  Oh the other   ,s say EH.Bernie   BTW, I did get a chuckle of the locals saying how much snow was coming down. Northners. All I could think was,how easy it would be to follow tracks. LMAO"
815229,Fisherman,2013-10-26 23:12:00,7201,"Aye caramba, little too early for that stuff.  Had a bit between #9 down to #7 this morning but nothing accumulated.  Hopefully Bernie can shine up the old beater for his collection.  Remember when I pulled it over, it had some pretty good compression."
815230,ccmtcanada,2013-10-26 23:13:00,7971,You are both stand up guys!!!  Would be great to see you up there at the Bernie weekends!
815257,Nipfisher,2013-10-27 01:26:00,2449,Probably passed you at some point Brian. We left North Bay at 7:50am en route to Huntsville. Driving conditions from Powassan to Burks Falls were not the best. Drove back tonight and only dealt with rain.
815258,irishfield,2013-10-27 01:30:00,26272,"7 hours.. must drive like Gramma !  ..and as for Bernie.. they don't come much better than that, if they do at all !"
815291,Handlebarz,2013-10-27 10:50:00,3790,Yep OFC at its finest there Kudos Brian.  I still remember one of or the first fire hall Christmas party my wife asked me your going where??? To meet who? Do you even know any of them? Ok Have you met any of them in person?  What a night that was heading about 3 hours drive for some chicken wings and fishing talk then driving home. My wife must have been nuts back then to not think I was cheating on her LOL. True OFC fashion I did have many offers to stay at other members houses and these were all people I knew from the message board only.  Great family we have here  Cheers Mike
