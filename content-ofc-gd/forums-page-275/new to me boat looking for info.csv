815236,skinny,2013-10-26 23:32:00,442,well I did it I bought a different boat its a 17.5 sea hawk 4cyl inboard bow rider I got real good deal on it and it came with a bunch of extras like a flare gun ( do I need this for this size boat)  also last time I registered a boat I could do it at service Ontario but I thought I heard that was changing  the boat also came with manual down riggers  (is there a way to modify to power)  darn I had more questions earlier  guess I'm getting old   more to come 
815244,irishfield,2013-10-27 00:01:00,26272,Registration has to be done directly to New Brunswick.. need to keep them in jobs down there...  http://www.tc.gc.ca/eng/marinesafety/debs-obs-paperwork-paperwork_boat_licence-3211.htm#a4
815250,i2cool2fool,2013-10-27 00:44:00,349,Heh. Need jobs everywhere.
815256,irishfield,2013-10-27 01:21:00,26272,Sorry.. just trying to add a bit of humour... notice how the gun registry went out.. and the boat registery went exclusive to NB at the same time..
