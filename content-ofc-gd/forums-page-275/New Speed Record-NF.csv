The contemporary artist celebrated after setting the world record at Trafalgar Wharf in Portsmouth by paddling the distance in two minutes flat. Galitzine is now planning to cross the Solent from Portsmouth to the Isle of Wight in a giant gourd powered by an outboard motor.   Nothing short of Amazing ...wouldnt you say?  Happy Friday
