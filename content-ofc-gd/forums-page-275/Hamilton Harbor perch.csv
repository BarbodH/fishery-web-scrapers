I have tried la salle off the concrete pier with worms and only caught gobbies. I might go to buy some minnows soon too so I will stop catching gobbies and start catching some real fish.  On a side note, here is a huge walleye I caught somewhere very late at night. It weighed 5.06 pounds on my electronic scale and had a measurement of 25.5 or .6 inches   Thanks, Matt."

We had a carp fish-in on Sunday at LaSalle and there were other guys catching perch on minnows. One guy guy caught a lot and some very big ones. Pier 8 is also good. There is a perch derby there on Sunday Oct. 27 at 8am-3pm. Bring small minnows.
