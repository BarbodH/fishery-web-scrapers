813589,206,2013-10-18 22:47:00,563,"Was cleaning the garage today and found this old paddle (pics below) It was found by my daughter and I a few years ago. We recovered it from the bottom of the Scugog river. We were fishing and spotted it on the river bed, It was covered with green slime and zebra muscles. I dragged it home much to the disapproval of my wife lol.  Anyway any thoughts or do you know anyone who might know much about paddles? I assume its of no significance but who knows, worste case it makes a cool wall mount.  Sorry pics aren't great      "

813641,Fishnwire,2013-10-19 03:07:00,983,I wonder if the little notches are just ornamental.  Never seen anything like it.
