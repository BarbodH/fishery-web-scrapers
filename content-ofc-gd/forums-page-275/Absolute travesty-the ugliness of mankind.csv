814216,bigugli,2013-10-22 00:12:00,6138,Anything for a dollar!!! That's humanity!
814219,wantabigone,2013-10-22 00:17:00,97,The biggest travesty is that people continue to buy tusks as trinkets or medicines. If no one were to buy tusk products there would be no market. No market-no poaching.  Unfortunately this will never stop until it is too late.
814226,wormdunker,2013-10-22 00:33:00,1711,Disgusting!  I'm happy to read that some of the poachers  received 16 year prison sentences & stiff fines.
814289,Dave Bailey,2013-10-22 14:16:00,1641,"The poachers in the field are mostly poverty stricken locals who are just trying to feed their families. What we need to do is go after the guys at the top, the ones running the operations. Grab them from the patio outside the cafe in Zurich, where they're sipping their high-priced coffee, and take them for a little ride. Maybe drop them off near a herd of elephants, those big males can be very protective of their group. They'll stompity-stomp anything that moves, and waving money at them doesn't protect you."
