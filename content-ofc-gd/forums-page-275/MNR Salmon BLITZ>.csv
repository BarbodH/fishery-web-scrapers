814548,mike rousseau,2013-10-23 16:56:00,4661,"I don't see this as effective... That's only about $120 per fine... That's a pretty small amount if these ""anglers"" are selling fish or keeping a LOT in the freezer to feed their families the rest of the year....  I slipped up in a local tribe one year... I thought the boundary was bridge A but it was bridge B... I had no fish.... There were others fishing the area before I arrived... Literally first troll... $250 fine... And there are no signs to show that your changing zones on these bridges... Nor is it in writing what bridge is the boundary... Just the FMZ maps...  So $120 per fine in my eyes is a joke for the blatant poaching occurring on Great Lakes tribs...  I would imagine it cost a lot more then $10,000 to perform this blitz.... So a few get a slap on the wrist today and back at it tomorrow.... And our dollars are down the tubes... ""Most"" know they're in the wrong... And these fines won't stop a thing unless they occur A LOT more regularity.... Honest people will learn... The rest will continue their ways... Second ofences should have HUGE FINES... That way when caught the first time they are aware that if they get caught again it will be a very large fine...miggt scare people enough to read up...  Anyways... My 2 cents...."
814550,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2013-10-23 16:59:00,0,with McGuinty squandering a billion and change you'd think the GTA tribs would be a GOLDMINE in the fall! hahahaha  certainly beats coming to me for the money!
814552,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2013-10-23 17:00:00,0,"at this point, it is the resource ""users"" that are paying for the resource.  the scale needs to tip over to resource ""abusers"" paying for conservation and enforcement budgets."
814560,Musky or Specks,2013-10-23 18:09:00,2710,"at this point, it is the resource ""users"" that are paying for the resource.  the scale needs to tip over to resource ""abusers"" paying for conservation and enforcement budgets. Oh Id like that but makes to much sense. As for the dollar total of the fines yes its not enough because if one person fights the charge the net cost to the province will probably be in excess of that total"
814564,davey buoy,2013-10-23 19:24:00,5505,"I'd like to see more as well,but it's a start.I think once they figure out a big weekend like that pays there salary  for a month or so,they may address this issue a little more serious.Let's hope so."
814591,TerryC,2013-10-23 21:16:00,196,I think this is a good start. I don't remember seeing a press release like this before.
814617,lurechucker,2013-10-23 22:26:00,28,about time they should keep it up

814439,hammercarp,2013-10-23 00:59:00,964,"Greater Toronto Area Salmon Migration Enforcement Blitz October 21, 2013 The Ministry of Natural Resources laid 90 charges totaling $10,930 in fines during a two weekend enforcement blitz on Lake Ontario tributaries across the Greater Toronto Area. During two weekends in September and October, Ministry of Natural Resources conservation officers from Peterborough, Guelph and Aurora districts, Lake Ontario and the canine unit, along with OPP police officers from Toronto, as well as Durham, Halton and Peel regions, checked over 450 anglers on many of the tributaries. Officers conducted uniformed and plainclothes enforcement operations related to the fall salmon migration. The blitz resulted in 90 charges for a total of $10,930 in fines. The most common offences involved snagging and netting fish, fishing in posted sanctuaries and fishing without a licence. Ten individuals were also issued summonses to appear in court. The Ministry of Natural Resources would like to thank members of the public for making over 110 calls to the MNR TIPS line for suspected unlawful harvesting during this yearâ€™s salmon migration across the Greater Toronto Area. The Ministry would like to remind anglers that it is illegal to intentionally hook or pierce a fish other than in the mouth, or use tackle such as large treble hooks weighted with sinkers for the purpose of foul-hooking fish. For further information on fishing regulations, please consult the 2013 Fishing Regulations Summary at ontario.ca/fishing. To report a natural resources violation, call 1-877-TIPS-MNR (847-7667) toll-free any time, or contact your local ministry office during regular business hours. You can also call Crime Stoppers anonymously at 1-800-222-TIPS (8477). "
814440,bobogo,2013-10-23 01:00:00,76,finally some good news from the MNR
814443,NAW,2013-10-23 01:04:00,4022,That's great!  They should do that once a month in certain areas!
814444,Richie Razor,2013-10-23 01:08:00,536,"They should have also confiscated their gear, impound their vechicle and send them to an educational course on the conservation of our natural resources"
814445,Joeytier,2013-10-23 01:09:00,3990,Very good news.  90 out of 450 anglers fined...unreal
814450,Christopheraaron,2013-10-23 01:29:00,3525,I thought that number would have been higher lol
814452,Moosebunk,2013-10-23 01:30:00,3970,Very good news. 90 out of 450 anglers fined...unreal   360 anglers not fined... 90 dumbarses fined. lol.
814454,BillM,2013-10-23 01:31:00,17367,Great news!
814476,fishindude,2013-10-23 02:12:00,220,'Bout time!
814487,pidge,2013-10-23 02:41:00,438,"Good on them for gettin the bad guys, but one thing stumps me...can the OPP lay charges as well? Or perhaps it was alcohol related stuff??"
814489,Christopheraaron,2013-10-23 02:47:00,3525,"Good on them for gettin the bad guys, but one thing stumps me...can the OPP lay charges as well? Or perhaps it was alcohol related stuff?? As far as I know they can"
814490,John Bacon,2013-10-23 02:50:00,3277,"Yes, any cop can lay fisheries related charges.  They usually only charge for fishing without a licence because they are not trained for enforcing the fisheries act.  However, they can charge for other fisheries related offenses too."
814493,bobogo,2013-10-23 03:02:00,76,"it only says 90 charges, so it is possible that some people were charged with multiple offenses. i don't think it's 90/450 people getting charged. either way, i thought it would be more."
814495,Out4Trout,2013-10-23 03:24:00,98,Great news. Regulations are useless without enforcement.

814502,fishindevil,2013-10-23 07:40:00,6254,Now if they could only start blitzing the white bucket brigade on all the dams it would be awesome !!!!  Here is some evidence I sent them about a month ago from buckhorn dam about a dozen bass in a bucket all about 12 inches long
814505,spincast,2013-10-23 09:13:00,3279,its a step in the right direction
814508,Rich,2013-10-23 10:09:00,3927,I agree with everything but the last part. That'd be a waste of tax money! Just take away their fishing rights.
814514,redpearl99,2013-10-23 12:40:00,259,I agree with everything but the last part. That'd be a waste of tax money! Just take away their fishing rights. just give them a cattle prod up the bum.... no more white buckets after that
814516,bobogo,2013-10-23 13:07:00,76,Now if they could only start blitzing the white bucket brigade on all the dams it would be awesome !!!! Here is some evidence I sent them about a month ago from buckhorn dam about a dozen bass in a bucket all about 12 inches long  Are there regulations where you can't keep too small a bass? I can't find it in the book. I know that would be too many bass/over limit.
814527,Richie Razor,2013-10-23 15:03:00,536,Just heard from my buddy that a guy up in the geen got caught with 5 bow's and had his truck impounded.... About freakin time!!!!
814528,northernpike56,2013-10-23 15:06:00,717,^ not if there were 2+ people fishing and putting in the bucket with sport licenses. It all depends on the circumastances
814529,northernpike56,2013-10-23 15:07:00,717,No size limit currently on bass. However it might be a good idea eventually
814533,BillM,2013-10-23 15:16:00,17367,Just heard from my buddy that a guy up in the geen got caught with 5 bow's and got caught and had his truck impounded.... About freakin time!!!!  I've seen people up there regularly make multiple trips to their truck to 'stock up'....    also have multiple stringers all over the place.     I love fishing there but man you really gotta turn your head the other way sometimes.
814535,Richie Razor,2013-10-23 15:34:00,536,"So true, it's disgusting really."
