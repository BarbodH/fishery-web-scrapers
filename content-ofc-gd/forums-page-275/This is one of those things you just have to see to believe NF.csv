814470,Cast-Away,2013-10-23 02:01:00,790,"You know, I saw that coming a mile away. The first thing that I though of was the ricochet and that the wall behind the target was not on an angle."
814330,Big Cliff,2013-10-22 19:41:00,6899,"I want one of these! 20mm of shear hurt! Just goes to show you, you don't need a gun to fight back though. Sling shots do not (yet) have to be registered.  http://www.liveleak.com/ll_embed?f=24113d89dfd8  "
814331,Christopheraaron,2013-10-22 19:44:00,3525,"Maybe a a helmet is needed more than he hand protection, yikes."
814333,davey buoy,2013-10-22 19:46:00,5505,"WTH,looked like this guy practiced well.That back panel will get you every time.Let's hope he was alright."
814334,ChasinTails,2013-10-22 19:47:00,90,"failure, why didnt he have eye protection at least"
814339,Terry,2013-10-22 19:59:00,14456,wow I did not expect to see that
814340,Christopheraaron,2013-10-22 20:00:00,3525,"Before that happened it was actually pretty cool, I'd like to see someone shoot a bird with that thing."
814341,muskymatt,2013-10-22 20:08:00,2608,"I think almost every kid has experienced that with a bb gun or pellet gun, some just don't smarten up for the wiser."
814345,lew,2013-10-22 20:21:00,12766,"Guess there's some truth to the old expression ""you'll shoot your eye  out with that thing""....almost  That was brutal"
814346,chefboi17,2013-10-22 20:22:00,128,"This video is fake, but it's still a strong reminder to know your backstop."
814348,Terry,2013-10-22 20:26:00,14456,looked pretty real to me
814349,Dontcryformejanhrdina,2013-10-22 20:27:00,535,"Notice the ""blood"" on his t-shirt before he gets hit. Maybe from take 1? lol"
814350,Big Cliff,2013-10-22 20:36:00,6899,"Notice the ""blood"" on his t-shirt before he gets hit. Maybe from take 1? lol The blood gushing out of his head looked pretty real to me. Saw the red on his shirt (before) but wondered if it was just red paint or something. Who would go to that much trouble to fake a video like that and not bother to wear a clean shirt?"
814351,Terry,2013-10-22 20:36:00,14456,"I think the ""Blood"" before the hit is artwork on his shirt"
814353,chefboi17,2013-10-22 20:38:00,128,"He did this As a promo for some kind of zombie movie he was participating in. after it went viral, he did a follow up video, basically detailing how it was done with the makeup, video editing, etc. It got me the first time I saw it though"
814355,Terry,2013-10-22 20:41:00,14456,yeah it is a fake  however the shirt was real  
814356,RiverGuy,2013-10-22 20:42:00,19,Holy crap that sling shot was pretty sweet..... You can actually see the steel ball come back and hit him in the noodle!!!! Hope he was ok after going to the hospital. Safety gear should have totally been worn when testing that out. That ball shot back hard
814358,Wolf 3,2013-10-22 20:47:00,134,"Well, at least his hand was well protected..."
814361,lew,2013-10-22 20:48:00,12766,"It probably is fake, but if it is, it's sure well done"
814362,GbayGiant,2013-10-22 20:52:00,1780,foreshadowing with the second shot.   You could see it coming. I just didn't think he would get it in the head. That guy wins the Darwin award hands down!
814369,Richie Razor,2013-10-22 21:01:00,536,"Lol totally fake, but pretty cool slingshot!!!"
814388,kickingfrog,2013-10-22 22:39:00,8333,Why would someone give that to muskiematt in the first place?
814411,Nipfisher,2013-10-22 23:56:00,2449,Why would someone give that to muskiematt in the first place?  If he is like Craig Anderson the steel ball would have went over his shoulder (or through the 5-hole).
814432,NAW,2013-10-23 00:43:00,4022,Crazy video.  How do you guys know it's fake?  Didn't expect to see that coming at all.
814458,Meely,2013-10-23 01:36:00,282,"Maybe he was just trying to get his ""bearings""....  "
814468,Moosebunk,2013-10-23 01:51:00,3970,wow I did not expect to see that  Ummmmmmmm yeah!  What he said. lol.
