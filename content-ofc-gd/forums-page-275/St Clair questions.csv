Was a half decent day caught my personal best musky but it was no where near the monsters ive seen come out of there. We fished the mouth of the river with the rest of the pack, which really isn't my cup of tea. Just wondering if the whole lake is murky or if it was just that area at the river mouth because of the rainfall Saturday? and are there areas of structure to be found out on the lake? The little exploring I did away from the mouth I didn't mark anything but flat bottom. Im not looking for anyones hot spots just a nudge in the right direction. Should I be looking for weed beds and structure out on the main lake to concentrate on?"

814862,Handlebarz,2013-10-24 22:35:00,3790,This time of year it's all about the bait fish find them you will find the musky. Time on the water helps alot as the windows that they are eating are very short this time of year so sticking out the day in hopes of hitting one or maybe two good windows is key also.
