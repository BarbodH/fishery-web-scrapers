814236,BillM,2013-10-22 01:12:00,17367,Roe juice and worm poop!!  I think I might quit fishing because of this.

814678,Moosebunk,2013-10-24 01:39:00,3970,  Never have I seen such realism Chris.  You are a true talent in the dark room.  Your photofinishing is beyond any need for further practice.  I wish to God I could catch muskie like that.
