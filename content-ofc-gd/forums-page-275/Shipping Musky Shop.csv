813908,outllaw,2013-10-20 12:45:00,1232,shipping is brutal. even in Canada rates have gone up. while express post is good there not cheap by no means.. when we ship to the u.s. side there system has there own way of dealing with Canadian products imported. they shelve them up to 30 days.. when you include brokers the goverments definatly aligned the brokerage firms up.. I am sure theres a few polictical nest eggs out there lol.

813927,Bill Shearer,2013-10-20 14:54:00,456,Many UPSstores near the border on the US side will receive packages from any shipper for $5-$15 depending on the size of the shipment. Plus $1day storage. They will also email you when it comes in. If you are within an hours drive it is often worth it. I use this option when the retailer won't ship to my PO box.

813938,MJL,2013-10-20 15:11:00,2427,"Terry, don't all long standing members have to start with post #1...........??????  Yes, all members have to start with post #1. Usually post #1 is an introduction about yourself (the person), not the business (or how innovative or great you think your lures are). Leave the self-touting promotions & slogans off the board - In the future, they may actually turn into a running joke (seriously). anyone remember Backwoods custom rods from back in the day?  From the board rules:  ""Spam will get you banned faster than anything else. Spam is any unsolicited business ad or offer. If someone happens to ask about a product or service you may offer, then you are of course free to mention it. If you come in here and spam, you will be given a pretty rude welcome by the population and it will only hurt your business! We have very reasonable ad rates and can set you up very quickly. Contact TJQ for ad rates.""  Your first post might not have broken the board rules under the pure definition, but it definitely leaves a strong spammy taste in a lot of people's mouths (mine included). Perhaps if you were a regular contributor to the board (aside from the 2 posts both about your business) or even offered an OFC discount, people might warm up to the idea of purchasing your products.

813326,JoshS,2013-10-17 15:29:00,729,Does anyone know if you get hit with brokerage fee's and duties and taxes ordering from muskyshop to canada?  I just got off the phone with musky shop... they can either ship UPS for $21 or USPS for $51. I'm assuming USPS is the better bet to possibly save on duties and taxes but I haven't shipped much from the states.  Anyone know how it works?
813338,bassjnkie,2013-10-17 16:54:00,1101,USPS will only charge you taxes and $9.50 if over $20.. With UPS the sky's the limit over $20... I always use USPS and many times get lucky and don't get charges..
813340,MJL,2013-10-17 17:17:00,2427,"Hey Josh  Here's the UPS brokerage chart http://www.ups.com/content/ca/en/shipping/cost/zones/customs_clearance.html  TBH, I'm not exactly sure how UPS does it. On most products I've had shipped UPS, UPS took the value of the product (say $100 for example), then took the shipping price ($21 as an example), charged HST tax on it (13% of product + shpping cost: 13% of $121) = $15.73. Then charged me brokerage based on a total of $136.73 (so according to that chart, brokerage alone is $29). That's just for brokerage.  Then you gotta pay HST on top of that along with ""duty"". I wouldn't be surprised if your total shipping charges to get the product to your door is 45-50% of the original price (that's what it's like for me when I have to ship UPS).  If given the choice between UPS and USPS, I'd choose USPS every time. At least I know what I'm paying when I click the ""checkout"" button."
813348,mike rousseau,2013-10-17 18:36:00,4661,I did.... Like $80 brokerage on a $200 rod...
813352,JoshS,2013-10-17 18:48:00,729,"Thanks for the help. I called UPS earlier and you're correct MJL, I'd be paying around 40% extra on top of my order. Crazy!!  USPS it is. Hopefully I elude any extra charges!  Mike - was that UPS or USPS?"

813425,MJL,2013-10-18 00:34:00,2427,"If you're stuck shipping through UPS and live within a driving distance from the border, try shipping to a place like CBI in Niagara falls, NY. Josh, this might be a reasonable way for you to do it and you can hit the big river nearby afterwards. My dad saved a significant amount of money when he ordered rims for our car and had it shipped to CBI.  http://www.cbiusa.com/  Another option would be to contact the retailer and ask them to ship the item as ""repair"" and list the package at a lower value. A couple months ago, I purchased around $750USD worth of camera gear. Shipping charge for FedEx was $41 and the company agreed to list the package as ""repair"" with a $100 value. Ended up paying only $16 in brokerage/customs. It could've been much, much, much worse ."

We've used it multiple times and have saved hundreds as many US stores offer free shipping within the US and prices down there are so much lower than here in Canada.   As for UPS, I refuse to have anything shipped by them. Some online retailers in the US only list UPS as an option to ship, but more often than not they're willing to send the package through USPS as many US retailers are well aware of the gouging by UPS.

One of the main reasons this newest upstart in Canada began was to cater to CANADIAN MUSKY ANGLER'S with similar issue's about shipping, duty, exchange rates & taxes of quality fishing products from the USA to Canada, like JoshS posted about. We felt this post was a great opportunity to introduce pdeezmuskyinlines.com to the rest of Ontario.  The other reason we started this brand new Canadian musky lure manufacturing company is because of our obsession with musky fishing and of course one of the greatest musky baits ever designed! As great as flashabou inlines are, there are deficiencies associated with them. We've addressed all the deficiencies and made this amazing bait even better!  Everyone currently using our baits share the same sentiment as this article written on NPS by outdoor contributor to Just Fishing, Gord Pyzer's Blog & Outdoor Canada, Wally Robins:  http://nationalprostaff.com/report/7130/The+Perfect+Blades+for+Muskies  Please check out http://pdeezmuskyinlines.com on google & Facebook.
