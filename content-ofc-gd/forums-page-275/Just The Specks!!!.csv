814874,Moosebunk,2013-10-24 23:30:00,3970,"Just The Specks Report.                    Summer fishing ended after driving 2910 km's for 9 days, 62 hours on the water, a warm monsoon before a cold frost, big winds & waves, starry campfires, a cozy sleeping bag & miles upon miles of hunting for speckled trout.  A report not forgotten, this merely took awhile to get around to. Truth is, play, work, tagged fish and a giant best muskie kinda slowed things some. Not planning to ramble on as much this time, I will say my buddy Mike and I returned to the Nip later in the summer for a second round of fishing there. Mike had his first taste in 2012 and was eager to try the specks again, and I on the other hand was looking to have a very different kind of trip than that which friend Len, my daughter Leah and I enjoyed earlier in the season.  Weather was a real mixed bag this year, to a point that my buddy Stevie later on during the trip opted out on driving from Mattice to join us for the final days. Being just Mike and I we risked getting sick of one another, but oddly that never happened. Speck obsessed, eager as I to fish, helpful, outdoors and fishing experienced, and happy to be aboard the Lund, partnering up with Mike simply makes good sense. He's a good soul. We have fun, keeping things mildly competitive (me more so probably) yet always supportive. Days fly by and this trip especially, as the speckle fishing went beyond.  76 speckled trout with 11 over 6-pounds, 10 over 24 inches and every one of them released. An unforgettable time. One sunny afternoon after morning thunderstorms we boated 25 fish, incredible moments to share. We kept a running fish tally as we went and I pretty well dragged behind the entire time. Trying to close the gap near the end I couldn't, and Mike stayed up 39 to 37 for the trip catching the fattest and heaviest fish by 0.1 of a pound, yet leaving me the only angler to catch any specks over 25 inches. Again though, no matter how we added it all together, it was truly great fishing for us both. Our best 5-fish bag weighed in at 32.9 pounds... that's SPECKLED TROUT!!!  During our stay we also caught and released four tagged fish. After waiting some time to contact the MNR to report on these specks, I was promptly phoned back and had a great chat with a local C.O. who kindly passed along the information on the fish we had released. Below are our measurements for 2013, and also the MNR's in 2012 as, all fish had been caught, aged, measured and tagged then.  Speck 1. Tag #07920. Male age 5. 2013 - 24.5 X 14in. 2012 - 21.9 X 13in. Speck 2. Tag #07750. Female age 5. 2013 - 20.75 X 11.5in. 2012 - 18.8 X 9.8in. Speck 3. Tag #07828. Male age 6. 2013 - 23.5 X 13in. 2012 - 20.9 X 12.2in. Speck 4. Tag #05026. Male age 5. 2013 - 22 X ???in. 2012 - 19.7 X 10.8in. (tag fell out in net and is a souvenir now)  Cool thing is, after talking with the Ministry last week it was reported that tagged fish 07920 and 07828 had been caught and released again afterwards.  What about the pike and lakers? Well, little effort went into the lakers really, probably six plus hours over three attempts with nothing to show for it. Pike were tough too, and after realizing this quick we didn't put too much effort into them either. Weather and fishing conditions dictated best bite was for specks, so we capitalized on that.  I have wanted to visit several other speckled trout fisheries over the years, and I probably will. But, being an absolute fish nut who's always hungry to chase the biggest fish of any species, it's hard to argue that any more beautiful and bigger blue halo'd specks could be found more plentiful anywhere else in this world.   Anyways, instead of more words here's a fish porn load of pics from our trip.                                                                                                            Good Fishin!!!  Bunk."

814879,Musky or Specks,2013-10-24 23:48:00,2710,Those are some beautiful fish Andrew. Its unarguable to me C&R works. Every fishery I know that has had strict regs put onto it rebounds in a quick manner. 10 fish over 24 inches is just freaking incredible
814881,Joeytier,2013-10-24 23:49:00,3990,It must be nice to experience such incredible speck fishing from the comfort of a rig like yours.  Theres no place like Nipigon...incredible stuff

It must be nice to experience such incredible speck fishing from the comfort of a rig like yours.   You'd know that same comfort well Joe.  Love me boat mang!   Outstanding Bunk. Sure wish I could have found the time to hook up with you. Next years for sure Bud.   Wished you could have made it too Dan.  Weather that weekend was good, bit gusty out, but over the Sat & Sun we managed 18.  Would certainly have been OK with you taking a cut of that just to enjoy your company.    You and Mike would have got on great with your speck obsessions.   *wipes away tears*        Looks like you and Mike had a stellar trip as well that week.  Great camera man, those photos are so crisp...   Nice meeting you and Keith.  They were on... all week... what can else can be said but ""slay days"" out there.   Imagine it won't be the last time we bump into each other.   I have beeen waiting for this report since we met on the lake.

The speck fishing was insane with you getting us onto football after football!Soooo many spotted crushers landed, multiple double headers, specks, specks, specks, specks, specks!  Ok I'm done.  SPECKS!!! "
