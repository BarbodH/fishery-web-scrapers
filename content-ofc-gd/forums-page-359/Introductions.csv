737367,ahrushow,2012-10-17 19:12:00,4,It's been fun learning and now I'm looking forward to the migratory fish coming in they are a lot more fun (legit hooked a chinook the other day but didn't land it) and it was on a dry fly!!!! Unfortunately I'm not much of photographer because I'm terrified of a big fish thrashing my camera phone outta my hands mid picture lol! But I will work on some photos!
