736657,krixxer,2012-10-15 22:08:00,274,I made a quick trip to the lake on Saturday. We only had a few hours before the weather would hit so we got started out to the spot. The action was fast and furious with but so was the wind. In the end we got blown off after two hours but it was the best dam two hours of perchin' ever.

736769,Donnie,2012-10-16 01:27:00,11,Nice Shun!  So what'd you do with the fillets?
736830,krixxer,2012-10-16 03:16:00,274,"We used perch crack on a drop shot 35 feet down. I've never casted for perch, I'm lazy! I just try to get on top of them.   The tupperware gets filled up with water and then frozen. Next time I'm ready for a fish fry I pull one out and thaw it out in the fridge.  the Shun, that one there is a santoku premiere , makes me feel like a ninja in the kitchen  "
