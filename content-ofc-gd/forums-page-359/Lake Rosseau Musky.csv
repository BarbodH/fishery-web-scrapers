737160,camillj,2012-10-17 00:31:00,1988,"Ok ... I need help fellas .... putting my meanest 12"" baits on ... bangin bottom in 20-30 feet of water near serious drop offs ... and all I can seem to muster up is the odd fat-arss Pike (don't get me wrong these are beauties - but I am chasing MONSTRONIUS MAXIMUS OLDFARTUS .... PM me to stay on the right side of the 'Law' ... ps ... sorry Roy, I assume I can name the Lake since there is actually over 300 miles of shoreline  Be nice and I'll share some Pike porn with ya"
737162,irishfield,2012-10-17 00:34:00,26272,Water is still warm Jon.... troll FAST.
737165,Gregoire,2012-10-17 00:48:00,1397,I would think that if the big pike are deep then the musky are shallower.
737168,camillj,2012-10-17 00:51:00,1988,SO ... Let me get this right Wayne ... are you saying I need to go to my 20lb balls ?
737170,camillj,2012-10-17 00:53:00,1988,"  Never really thought of it that way ... I was actually thinking I should try just about 10' below the ""top"" school of Lakers ... only problem is those hungry morons will just about anything now that the season is closed"
737171,Andrew Grant,2012-10-17 00:53:00,201,.
737173,Handlebarz,2012-10-17 01:01:00,3790,Never fished it but know if you are looking at lakers suspended then there must be bait fish above them if so I would be running my baits right through the bait fish or above it. I would guess you are to deep with your lures. Target them suspended fish its hard to stuck to but awesome when you figure it out.
737180,camillj,2012-10-17 01:17:00,1988,Thanks Mike ... gonna speed-er-up and raise up to 15' ... most of the flat I been nailing the big Pike on are actually ranging between 16 - 30 feet (along the ridges) with drop-offs to 60-80' right next door (was actually thinking I might try a little deeper next)... spent alot of hours dragging hardware in the 10 - 20' range with nothing sighted/marked or hit.  Water temps were 58 - 60 on the surface last weekend.
737183,irishfield,2012-10-17 01:21:00,26272,Why you running riggers??   That's still some warm water for fall... 5.5mph or so..
737190,camillj,2012-10-17 01:32:00,1988,Yessiree Wayne ... I got nowhere to mount my Salty's (the boats only got gimble mounts ... so I run the rigger to keep the line in the water when I am dragging them great big spoons (even if the ball is just a few feet under the surface) ... also kinda like the 'instant' hookset of a fully loaded rod when it releases ... gives me time to light a fresh smoke  ... Gonna try dragging one a them thar BIG LIPPED - poo-kinese-or-is-it-a-duckling sticks I got from ya last year ... (you know - the ones that can actually re-dredge the channel for them eco-friendly cottagers ... so I wont even need to put it on the riggers - but I may need to put the safety harness on the rod  But up till couple weeks ago it was a tossup between gargantuos-lakerous-hungry-freakus and biggus-esox-holy-motherofgoddess and I wasnt too fussy either way on the biggest Williams ever made  Anyhow if ya need a little break I'd be happy to pick ya up in Port Carling
