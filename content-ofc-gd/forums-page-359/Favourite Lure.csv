737626,OhioFisherman,2012-10-18 14:01:00,6623,"Well I always tried to find what would work on a body of water quickly, some favorites?  Storm wee steelie wart, a multi species crankbait, they seemed to work on most bodies on water and were not species specific.  Jig and pig or jig and plastic, same deal, mostly thought of as a bass lure? but I have caught walleyes, pike, crappie, and hooked Muskies on them.  6 inch zoom lizard, junebug, watermelon blue fleck, just a lure that usually worked for me.  3 1/2 - 4 inch tube, sadly for me they also seemed quite effective for carp and sheephead in waters that had them. LOL  6 inch Zoom utail worm.  Storm Texas shad, a rattletrap style lure, just better success on them than similar lures, also multi species.  Original floating Rapala 3-7 inch, I have caught fish on them just doing nothing but a cast and twitch.  Jig and grub, jig and shad, even 2 inch ones seemed capable of catching some decent fish.  Buzzbait, although I was generally slow to throw them, just had better hookup rates casting an unweighted lizard in the same spots.  Spinnerbaits, in line or other, they can be hot.  Heddon sonar, Silver Buddy, go to blade baits.  Jigging Rapala, even caught catfish on them.  Smithwick Devil`s horse, Heddon Torpedo.  Jitterbug -  Hula Popper.  Red Eye spoon, Johnson silver minnow, dardevle, great up north baits.  6 - 8 inch Cisco Kid crankbaits, LOL my go to lose a lure on a big fish up north. Super lines 40 years ago were anchor ropes.  I caught a heck of a lot of pike on a U 20 Flatfish years ago, what`s up with that?"
