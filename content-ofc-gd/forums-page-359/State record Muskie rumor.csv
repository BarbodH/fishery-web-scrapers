737482,glen,2012-10-18 00:27:00,2641,You going to try to get your name on it?  I guess if you gave them enough cash.
737485,Stoty,2012-10-18 00:36:00,2910," Hahaha, not my species of target. Now, if it were a LM or SM....that's a whole different story!"
737486,Roy,2012-10-18 00:40:00,13728," Only one name can appear on the application and that'd be the name of the person who hooked, fought and landed the fish."
737488,glen,2012-10-18 00:43:00,2641,Glad you have a sence of humour Stoty.   And thanks for the answer Roy.
737489,Stoty,2012-10-18 00:48:00,2910," But in this case, didnt they say that it was a team effort, and all three had a hand in fighting/landing the fish? Does it go to the guy that ""hooked"" it?"
737490,Roy,2012-10-18 00:52:00,13728," If that's really the case, I think it will be disqualified."
737492,Stoty,2012-10-18 00:59:00,2910,"This is from the second link on the first page that was posted.  ""I'am the guy in the middle on the picture above. It was 58.0 lbs. and 59 inches long. I caught it on 8lb test line while fishing for big smallies on Bellaire. Took 2 hours and three guys to get it in the boat.""   Now...was he the only one fighting it, or did they take turns? Or Did he hook/fight it, and had help from the other two in landing it?"
737497,glen,2012-10-18 01:02:00,2641,That's what happened to the woman that caught a record marlin.  Someone else had a turn on the rod and therefor no record. That was saltwater though. Different rules for different record keepers though. For a state record it may not matter
737498,Roy,2012-10-18 01:03:00,13728,"Let me clarify that. Friends will always say that it was a team effort. It's the right thing to say. But if one of the three was able to put the guy on the fish because of his knowledge of the water and another was very helpful because of his experience as a netman, it'll have been a 3 man effort but only the guy who set the hook, fought the fish and brought it to the net will get credit for the record."
737500,Roy,2012-10-18 01:06:00,13728,"Well, it's a great fish, they're to be congratulated and I'm sure that Michigan authorities will sort it all out if it needs sorting out."
737502,glen,2012-10-18 01:08:00,2641,Why would he hand over the rod .  It's a muskie not a marlin.  I hope it's ok.        I like what Roy says about a team effort. That's the way I see it when I Am on big fish.
737509,Slimeball,2012-10-18 01:37:00,30,Joe Seeberger (guy in the middle) fought the fish himself. The others only aided in lifting it in the boat....
737515,Stoty,2012-10-18 01:49:00,2910," I guess that answers my question then! Thx Slimeball, lol"
737517,glen,2012-10-18 02:06:00,2641,From a post that started as a rumour we have done well.  Thank you for putting this story up and keeping the info coming. Some people are surprised about the ending. I am impressed by how much the old record was beat.  This is one of the big ones we all try to catch. I hope people realize how great a fish it is.
737566,Billy Bob,2012-10-18 10:05:00,5865,I don't know if the fish was a record or not....don't really care...   BUT there is DEFINITELY a NEW RECORD HERE.......a discussion of a probable muskie record without the thread being LOCKED...

They took a legal fish, Great! They killed it, they're entitled too.... But kill it humanly."
737687,Rich Nelson,2012-10-18 17:45:00,332,Kill it humanely? Cmon... Im sure you have no problem ramming a bunch of hooks into a fish yap...
736595,Handlebarz,2012-10-15 19:26:00,3790,Wow the countdown has already started on this thread.  Big fish for sure
736617,Squid,2012-10-15 20:17:00,1656,"You got that right Mike, pretty sad eh?"
736661,Rich Nelson,2012-10-15 22:12:00,332,"Every year there are posts about giant Muskies that turn out to be much smaller than originally claimed, so its understanding that people are skeptical. Everyones entitled to their opinion. It a big fish for sure, but IMO not 58 lbs unless she had a diet of rocks. Time will tell, because if its as big as claimed, then it will be the new record. If it isnt as big, it will be forgotten, and all the guys thinking it isnt that big will be right. Pics are deceiving, especially a ""non traditional"" shot of 2.5 guys holding it.  Time will tell...."
736670,glen,2012-10-15 22:24:00,2641,Yes if it is a record time will tell. Nice to see pics of big fish though.
736672,Whopper,2012-10-15 22:27:00,2174,"That's a dandy!  Any time someone puts up a monster fish with stats their called a liar, sad fact Mike"

736686,Dutch,2012-10-15 22:47:00,831,Big fish - yes.  Record fish - highly unlikely.
736702,Rich Nelson,2012-10-15 23:15:00,332,"Probably because there are a lot of guys that are lying about the size... Or the first rumors that hit the forums have grown before the true facts come out. The fish is also dead, so people can say what they want. Ha ha There are lots of posts with Big Musky pics on this site from well respected members that no one questions, and there is only positive feedback. Not every musky post goes south like certain guys pretend they do. Lets face the facts... Certain guys cant read a tape or scale, and feel they need to add length or weight... I dont know if thats the case here, but like I said, we will soon find out. The ones actually being negative here are the ones whining about Musky posts going south. Everyone has an opinion, and is free to share it. Im willing to bet it isnt as big as claimed ( my opinion, not fact)"
736710,Rich Nelson,2012-10-15 23:47:00,332,Heard an unconfimed report that it was verified by Michigan DNR. Could be a record after all... Gotta be a bass guy catchin it. Ha ha
736717,Whopper,2012-10-16 00:00:00,2174," More times than not there are skeptics to big fish pictured with stats listed, wasn't to long ago here that a pretty well respected member/guide was the target, some claimed it was the lense work. Sorry but that's just the way it is. Some won't even post pics of catches for this simple reason. Another thing, it's just not about the mighty muskie either, lots of other species get scutinzed as well. I'm really not wanting argue this matter, it's basically my opinion."
736721,Roy,2012-10-16 00:07:00,13728,     Calm down dudes. Please don't make it sound like it's a community thing. Jealousy/envy gets to everyone. The man caught a big fish. He might have gotten wrapped up in the excitement of the moment. Let it be and let the story unfold. Thanks.

736739,Handlebarz,2012-10-16 00:27:00,3790,I guess I was taken the wrong way I was reading other replies and saw how they were going and figured it was heading the wrong way. I was not complaining about the catch. I can not tell the size from the picture I just know its a big fish.

737479,Stoty,2012-10-18 00:18:00,2910,"Totally random question.... but IF this becomes a record... can more than one person's name be on it? Or would it technically be the person who ""hooked"" the fish?"
736370,mistaredone,2012-10-14 15:35:00,913,"I pulled this off another board posted yesterday.   Again this is not from me  If true it would be a state record   Thought I would share what I saw today. I went down to the Ellsworth Farmers Exchange to get some gas around 1:30 this afternoon and saw several people gathered around the back of a truck. I figured somebody shot a nice buck, but after fueling I walked over and saw one monster of a fish. I wish I would have had my phone so I could have gotten a pic. I talked to the fisherman who ran the fish to the Farmers Exchange to be weighed on a certified scale and he said it was 59 lbs. He said they caught it in Lake Bellaire which is just up the chain from the previous record which came from Torch Lake about four or five years ago. It was on the tailgate of a Toyota Tundra and darn near filled the whole tailgate! I think he said it was 54"" long, but I wasn't paying to close attention to the length. The lady working at the farmers xchange said they were from down state. I wish I had pics to share, but thought I would pass it along anyway. Looked like a freshwater shark!"
736371,BillM,2012-10-14 15:39:00,17367,54in and 59lbs?  That thing must have had a girth of like 30 inches!

736515,Weeds,2012-10-15 08:49:00,782,Obvious flaw in the story. There is now way that fish could possibly weigh 58 pounds. Everbody knows the tailgate ot a Toyota Tundra cannot support that kind of weight.               Just kidding. Any chance to get Billybob riled up and I'll take it. I actually drive a Tundra too.

This fish is three grown men long and the guy on the left is using his forearm to brunt the wieght.  It says on the other board that it was verified by a co at 58 plus pounds breaking the current record by around 8lbs. The scale needs to be tested now for the books. Congrats to the angler!!!!!
