736111,TDunn,2012-10-12 20:14:00,680,"Went to camp up in Hornepayne for a week at the end of August. Weather was great. Fishing was descent and we managed to get a lot of work done around camp.  On the first day i just hit a few small streams for brookies. We caught a pile and kept some to snack on.      Then I hit a small lake in a provincial park in my hobie. Spinner, split shot and Gulp was working great.            A few friends showed up a few days into the week and stayed with us for the weekend. We fished, rode atvs and had a fire each night.        caught this pike with some extra jewellery                Picked up Ted in White River while we were at camp. He was up at Marmac for a few weeks working.    Figured we better put him back to work since he was done there! lol    The last night we headed over to a lake trout lake to try our hand at a few of the lunkers that live in this lake. We gave it a good 3 hours but to no avail. No hits for any of us. On the brightside it was a beautiful night.      Salmon season arrived quickly and before I knew it I was out guiding on the St. Marys.     I as able to get out with my cousin Ted. We did quite well on the darkened up nooks but nothing huge....all cookie cutters for us...      Next was coho with my other cousin Mike....which I absolutely love to cast for on the St. Marys during early fall on spinning tackle. Vicious hits are the norm. Very similar to steelhead hardware hits and fight almost as hard.                       Also caught some descent perch and pike casting for coho      I hope you enjoyed! Bring on the Steelhead!
