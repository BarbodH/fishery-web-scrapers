737936,Parisite,2012-10-19 13:44:00,66,"Quickly!?? It's been going on for two days!  People see red and don't fully read someone else's post, misinterpret it and go off on the other person.  I don't like seeing people break the rules just as much as the next guy but you can't just show up on this board to yell and scream and go off on other board members.  Here's an idea to all those who are (overly) passionate about the sport they love and are getting upset with others who love the sport as well -  Volunteer with your local conservation authority so you can educate those ""bad people"" you see on the local waterways in an official and honourable way rather than as a vigilante civilian.  And stop screaming at other members of a message board while you're at it."
737940,spinnerbaitking,2012-10-19 14:37:00,1622," I'm not sure I'd be mouthing off about taking things into your own hands & slashing someone & leaving them to swim for as long as they can, try educating them or Take Pictures & report them or Shut Up, it wouldn't fair to good for you if you thought someone was doing something wrong & you walked up to them & broke their Fishing Rod lol Tight Lines SBK"

737973,BillM,2012-10-19 16:58:00,17367," Good god man, you continue to ignore facts and just spout off useless drivel over and over again.  I think the funniest part of your argument is turning your own opinion into facts, then arguing them! (You ever see a fish successfully reproduce at Burt dam?  LOL!!!!)  Have you actually fished any of the southern shore Lake O tribs?  Maybe the southern shore Lake E tribs?  If you actually spent time on the rivers, you'd realize 90% of those idiots netting, snagging, ripping fish are doing it for the meat.  I can't count the number of times I've been way up stream on a Gbay trib and seeing guys fill their backpacks with nice fresh nasty boot fillets with the 5 of Diamonds still sticking out of their backs.  You're holier then thou attitude gets really old, really fast."
737993,mercman,2012-10-19 19:46:00,7054,"  Educate, thats all we can do I think i pointed that out earlier on.One is never too old to learn either.And once we have been educated, we must pass that education on to others."
738025,kemper,2012-10-19 21:28:00,2232," ""Fish on! Coming DOWN!""  I watched a guy fillet two big hens streamside last week on GBay, the skiens got pitched right into the river along with the guts. There is a serious white-bucket brigade mentality up there. Less general looganism, but for some reason a whole lot more bow leave the river on a rope.  Again, assuming that person is within their limit it's for none of us to judge. It's the crew of guys that hang out at the Beaver and rope a limit every single day for the entire season that irks me..."
738027,kemper,2012-10-19 21:31:00,2232," I suspect the single-night piles of 40-50 slit boots at Port Hope aren't due to roe anglers, but those who make a good buck selling the eggs for another purpose. Prepared correctly, that stuff is worth a lot of money - lake Ontario boot quality or not."

738063,SirCranksalot,2012-10-19 22:27:00,3291,I didn't catch any female salmon so bought a pound of roe for $20. I was told it was from farm raised fish. Seemed like a good solution to me.

738074,misfish,2012-10-19 22:45:00,29133, I have seen that. How does it work for you? Also seen brown and rainbow roe for sale.
738076,kemper,2012-10-19 22:50:00,2232, I've also gone that route with decent results. Can be had cheaper if you buy in bulk.  NOTE: make sure you are actually buying this foe from a farm/hatchery and not from the idiot that left 10 carcasses at the side of the river last night...
738078,davey buoy,2012-10-19 22:57:00,5505," How would you know for sure?,Word of mouth maybe?'"
738099,Snidley,2012-10-19 23:25:00,620,"I guess you guys missed my point. Roe retained is no different than fillets retained but it is usually kept for much longer AND guys do not view that freezer full of roe as part of their possession limit like they might with actual fillets. That's were the ethics come into it. It's illegal but you won't get caught. So what do you do. My bet is the guys that advocate roe fishing keep taking fish. That's unethical as well as lame and illegal. The slaughter up north is a disgrace plain and simple and I agree locals as well as many visitors keep much more than their limit. That's why in BC, where these animals come from, you not only can't use bait or scent but as part of your salmon/steelhead tag you must write down all retained fish immediately and you are limited to an annual catch limit(that gets smaller every year). To compensate fishing clubs and the natural resources ministry designate lakes where anglers can go and catch keepers that are triploid rainbows that do not breed at all and are there for sport and food(but obviously not for eggs)"
738104,kemper,2012-10-19 23:35:00,2232," Can you direct me towards the section of the regs that states roe retained is the same as fillets? I'm not trying to stir the pot, I would honestly like to read it myself.  I'm thinking if I catch a fish and eat it the guts are a by-product and go in the garbage. If you aren't a roe fisherman and the skiens go into the trash, how is that different from bagging the eggs and putting them into the freezer?  In my opinion, its MORE ethical to use that roe rather than toss it in the can. The native population that called this great country home before we swindled it from them were masters at using every part of the animal and wasting nothing. I'm not advocating for a freezer full of roe, in fact I never have more than a ziplock or two anyway, just putting it out there that there are lots of ""ethical"" roe anglers that keep the odd fish and use the roe instead of trashing it."
738112,SirCranksalot,2012-10-19 23:58:00,3291, I just got the stuff so I can't tell how good it is. Looks good to me--big eggs--but I'm a relative newby to steelheading. so what do I know? I've only caught 1 on roe so far. The other few have been on lures.
738114,Photoz,2012-10-20 00:08:00,792,"I just have to make one trip during the height of the salmon run to either Port Hope or Port Credit, go to the fish cleaning station. and grab 2 skeins out of the trash barrel, take 'em home treat 'em & freeze 'em up. There must be literally TONS of the salmon roe just tossed in the garbage, and it's so much easier than having to compete with the great unwashed, flossing or even (gasp) snagging one of those ol' brown boots. Try it . . .   you'll like it!"
738224,BillM,2012-10-20 18:55:00,17367," How much roe do you think one person actually needs for a season of steelheading?  You're a former roe user aren't you? (I find your holier then thou attitude even funnier now, lol ironic)  You should know it's not a lot."
738228,Christopheraaron,2012-10-20 19:07:00,3525, would it still be like that now?
738230,Spiel,2012-10-20 19:10:00,9065,"I still have roe in my freezer from many years past, all harvested legally along with meals well enjoyed. It's rare for me to keep more than 2 or 3 fish a season of any species but I'll be damned if someone tells me I have to throw the roe away from legally caught and retained fish that were wonderfully consumed by me and my children, who by the way enjoy fresh steelhead over any other fish. To point I rarely bring any fish home but they love steelhead and given that I'll selectively harvest a few each fall and if the roe is there I'll take it and use it. My choice, my right!  Snidley, lose the attitude or be gone!"
738274,Snidley,2012-10-20 21:04:00,620,Last time I checked I don't make the law. In this case the Fed's do.
737139,4x4bassin,2012-10-16 23:44:00,1025,"Well I was out today taking the dog for a little run in the bush and on my way home I wanted to check out a local river (small trib.) and see if there were still any salmon around . The spot I go to is close to the road and last week there was about 10 salmon darting around in this pool , well any way as I approach the river I see a truck parked there and this is not uncommon due to people stopping to watch the salmon do there thing or even maybe a turkey hunter so as I slowly drive by I see this guy come out of the bush with a fishing rod in hand and a backpack and he seemed to be in a hurry ! Well I put the truck in reverse and backed up , when I got up to him I advised him that this river was closed to fishing and of course he gives me the ""Really ,not even for salmon. I had no idea"" remark   So I advised him to brush up on his reading skills and check out the regulations , I also told him that the MNR patrol this area quite frequently(which they do) and he is lucky I seen him and not them . Anyways that is my good deed for the day even though this turkey will probably be at it again in a couple days ."

737346,azebra,2012-10-17 18:20:00,168,"And what about the person who cuts open hens takes their skiens and leaves then to die? Why can't there be more conservation officers? I've had to put down two hens this year that I walked up on that we're alive with their gut sliced open so the a hole angler can keep ALL her roe,,, and not even cut her gills open, so they were just trying to swim, I'm sure it must be hard with no functioning internals and a gaping hole in your belly... Where are the Co's? I might start taking legalities in my own hands, I.e break poachers rods. Find the fish slasher and slash him and leave him to swim for as long as they can before a good person comes and puts them outta their misery, where are the CO's?..... If there is a CO on here come out and talk about the lack of you people esp on the weekends when the majority of the goof offs come out and play\poach does any one read these posts? Does any one care? Maybe fishing should be banned in ontario maybe just southern ontario because we have all these arse hole poacher snaggers flashlight fishers gut slashing murderers and roe stealers so they can snag another....... If you want roe. ,gently rub the belly of the hen and she'll squirt eggs! Don't cut her skein out nd leave her alive cut her gills and take her meat too.........

737390,Snidley,2012-10-17 20:10:00,620,"Ban all roe angling and make all anglers wear their current fishing licence on the outside of their clothing (the first regulation would follow the rest of Canada and the second is the law is some US states). With those two new rules that would be implemented with zero cost there would be lots of ""self policing"" among anglers and the major reason for poaching would be gone. Loogans and their bait fishing ways have always been a plague especially around Bronte and the Humber but nothing is ever done to address it. It not only looks bad it IS bad. Time river anglers to stop being hackers and learn to fish with alternative baits even if it's just for the optics (which it is not)."

I don't want to be the loudest buti sure will make a comment on what goes on, considering there is approximately a 3 percent reply rate to the views, hopefully some people out there will have a little more conservation, fish friendly, people friendly state of mind. Sure the poachers will poach and the sun will rise.. But we need to be a group, a family of happy law biding anglers who enjoy the fishing just as equal as the catching and leave it at that... If you have to snag or net a salmon any where in the river by the dam or else where..your a loser who should be fined. My girlfriend was using a dry fly of all and had a chinook rise and eat that bugger, I rolled my eyes when she took it outta my box, but she said ""you never use it"" "" only in the summer""   Literally a few drifts later....

Having some holier then thou attitude all the while hiding behind a computer screen and spewing insults like some keyboard cowboy..  I like fishing with roe, I make sure that when I do gather roe I'm doing it from systems that won't be impacted by my actions (hence the reason I go stateside and gather roe from a bunch of Lake O stockers)...  As far as conservation is concerned, you'll be hard pressed to ever find a fish in my freezer.  I think last year I kept a total of 2 small shakers from a Lake Huron trib for the old man.. Other then that, I'm 100% catch and release.   I can't even eat the wrong word things (I'm allergic)..  I'm strictly in this for the love of the sport, nothing else."

737877,Snidley,2012-10-19 03:40:00,620,"Milking a fish is legal but it not only counts for your daily limit it counts toward your possession limit. This is where the poaching issue raises it's ugly head. This means that if you carry brown roe and steelhead roe, or the roe from 2 browns or 2 rainbows or you have roe from 2 trout in the freezer and you then milk a trout or keep a trout   you are over your limit and are a poacher. I would say this issue applies to about 99% of the roe anglers out there and they are over most of the time. Naturally there is no enforcement so its a case of being ethical which means that the roe crowd can break the law with impunity and slap each other on the back while they strip out the future for one form of bait. Or like Bill M go to another jurisdiction such as Pennsylvania or New York and strip out their future. Well done Bill well done."
737879,kemper,2012-10-19 03:48:00,2232," I would love to see the statistics on natural reproduction in the river that Bill is talking about... I would wager that something 1-3 percent actually spawn.  There is a reason they dump millions of fish into NY tribs, they built dams a mile from the lake on all of them.  Fish with roe, don't fish with roe, eat salmons, don't eat salmons...  As long as everyone stays within their limit then that's that. If you're looking to harass anyone head up north and watch the ""locals"" stringer their limit every single day.  If Bill is a poacher for keeping one or two fish a year, I guess I'm a poacher too..."

737900,BillM,2012-10-19 11:49:00,17367, You're not stupid enough to think those fish actually successfully reproduce do you?   Or perhaps I'm giving you too much credit.
737927,Snidley,2012-10-19 13:25:00,620,"Reproduction on the US side is not as good as here, but, being among the most adaptable fish, those trout do reproduce AND as any smart person knows trout spawn multiple times not just once like Pacific Salmon. So by killing them you eliminate their  life and the opportunity to be caught multiple times on multiple runs, all so the angler has free bait. In addition the collection of roe becomes the basis for virtually all the loogan behavior you see on the river.  Every bait angler has their own particular spin on why it's ethical for them to collect hens for the eggs but everyone else is a jerk for the way they collect their stringer of fish for food, trophies whatever. Bottom line is that roe fishing is part of the traditional methodologies like trot lines, jug fishing, spearing, snatching, bleaching etc. They are all very effective at getting the stringer filled up but are also unsustainable and unsporting. They are also methods that are illegal in all of Canada except Ontario."
