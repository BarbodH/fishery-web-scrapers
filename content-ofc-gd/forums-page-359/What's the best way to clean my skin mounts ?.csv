I'm redoing my Man Cave top to bottom , and I smoke .. My fish are yellowed and discolored ... Any tips on how to clean them up without damaging them more than they already are ?  Thanks  Randy "

737539,camillj,2012-10-18 02:39:00,1988,I took a big Pike head from the '60s (it was pretty badly beaten up) ... but it was a memento from before my Dad passed away so I wanted it done .... took it over to the good folks at 'Advanced'  ... I can't say enough about what a great restoration they did !
737548,Muskieman,2012-10-18 03:39:00,2472,"They're all in great shape (except for the 30 yr old 40"" Pike ) ... A good cleaning is all they need I think ... Don't wanna spend any $$ on this .. Man Cave renovation is already costing enough"

Try it on the back side of the mount first as it contains ammonia that may effect the paint if its not sealed good. Use q-tips in the mouth and other tough to get at places."
737744,fishnsled,2012-10-18 20:31:00,3520,Found the following as I had a bit of time to kill today. Whatever you decide to do try a test spot on the back of the mount first. And take some before and after pictures as well.     
737752,Rod Caster,2012-10-18 20:49:00,5784,a bit a vinegar diluted into water would probably work well. It won't be harsh.
737758,misfish,2012-10-18 20:58:00,29133,"Put them on your roof rack and go through the car wash.LOL   I just wiped mine with a damp cloth. If need be,I also did it with windex."

737949,jimmer,2012-10-19 15:14:00,2730,"Dust off fish with a paint brush and them use a damp cloth to get the harder stuff off. I wouldn't spray any type of cleaner on them, it might react to the paint. The yellowing might be another issue. That might be right in the paint and you can't do anything about that. When I was running my taxidermy business, I might have re-painted the fish if the yellowing was severe. If the fish looks dull, sometimes a new coat of gloss will make then look almost new. The best thing to do is to clean them monthly."
