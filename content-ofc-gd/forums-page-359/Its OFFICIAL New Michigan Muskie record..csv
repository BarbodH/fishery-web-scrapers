738066,Jigger,2012-10-19 22:33:00,1237,nice shop jedi! can really get a feel for the true size. What a big fish!
738067,jedimaster,2012-10-19 22:37:00,3472,Its a big fish. I think I should have extended the belly on the right of his right hand a bit further down now that I am looking at it. It sure looks bigger with only one person holding it. I just can't believe he caught this from shore fishing on lake scugog.
738070,Handlebarz,2012-10-19 22:42:00,3790,  I'll second that. Heck if they ripped that pic I wonder what is next $50 musky bills there to.
738079,jedimaster,2012-10-19 23:01:00,3472,"Here is another edit, The first one I did with paint, this one I did with photoshop, neither are great but, you can take your pick...   "
738080,mistaredone,2012-10-19 23:04:00,913,Lol!  5 years from now that pic will pop up as a new fish caught
738081,jedimaster,2012-10-19 23:05:00,3472,"LOL I was thinking the same thing, that both of those pictures will pop up on the internet and make there rounds like that pike picture. HAHAAHA I just hope he gets a really awesome mount done of that beast and puts the pictures online."
738093,Dutch,2012-10-19 23:19:00,831,"I was a doubter, but the scales don't lie.  Yum - crow tastes good."
737984,TJQ,2012-10-19 18:46:00,7806,"A new state record was recently confirmed by the DNR! The new record comes courtesy of a Great Lakes muskellunge caught on Saturday, October 13 at 10:30 a.m. by Joseph Seeberger on Lake Bellaire in Antrim County. The fish weighed 58 pounds, measured 59 inches long and had a girth of 29 inches.    Read more here."
737988,jedimaster,2012-10-19 19:33:00,3472,"Like I said, ""That's a BIG muskie!."""
737989,Joeytier,2012-10-19 19:38:00,3990,"If I had to fight a muskie for two hours, I'd sure hope it was some kind of record!  What a giant"
737990,davey buoy,2012-10-19 19:39:00,5505,"Massive fish!!!!,makes you wonder how many bigger ones are out there?."
737991,captpierre,2012-10-19 19:41:00,2521,On a minnow.  Likely 8 lb line.  Amazing.  Picture would be way better if only the one guy held it.
737992,Rich Clemens,2012-10-19 19:42:00,3131,I WANT ONE
738000,crappieperchhunter,2012-10-19 20:21:00,2582,I can't even imagine how much chowder you could make with that
738001,blaque,2012-10-19 20:25:00,2419, Exactly.....i keep saying the same thing to myself. Everytime i see this fish on the internet all 3 of them are strung across it. Its actually making the fish look smaller than it actually is. I know its a massive fish but it would look even bigger propped up with one guy.
738002,Billy Bob,2012-10-19 20:25:00,5865,All that fish and it still tastes like....  Congrads to the guy who landed it......  But I still would rather catch a few nice perch....
738003,TJQ,2012-10-19 20:27:00,7806,ok... so some photoshop guru needs to crop out the other two guys....... hint hint lol
738008,davey buoy,2012-10-19 20:42:00,5505," I think we both know someone, lol ."
738009,d_paluch,2012-10-19 20:43:00,343,"wicked fish!  Sad to see it die though...it must have been quite old, anyone have a guess as to its age?"
738011,misfish,2012-10-19 20:46:00,29133," He,s busy tieing roe bags. He,s come to the dark side.  I have no idea about that fish. It,s big."
738012,jedimaster,2012-10-19 20:56:00,3472,Ask and ye shall recieve  
738014,davey buoy,2012-10-19 21:00:00,5505,Very nicely done!!!
738015,Billy Bob,2012-10-19 21:05:00,5865,HEY.....that's my DUCK HUNTING SPOT.....
738018,kickingfrog,2012-10-19 21:15:00,8333, With the cox-less eight?
738020,Billy Bob,2012-10-19 21:19:00,5865,:dunno:
738021,TJQ,2012-10-19 21:23:00,7806,see.... now it looks bigger!!!!
738024,Joey,2012-10-19 21:26:00,9122,"Yup, looks pretty big with just one guy holding it!!!  What a great catch!!!"
738026,jedimaster,2012-10-19 21:28:00,3472,And for the record I did not magnify the fish. Only took out the people and edited in where the other hands were.
738056,ProFishermanJones,2012-10-19 22:13:00,77,They must really like your editing skills i seen your exact edited pictures on this website!!  http://ontariofishingnetwork.com/2012/its-official-angler-catches-58-pound-great-lakes-muskellunge-in-antrim-county-breaks-michigan-state-record/
738058,jedimaster,2012-10-19 22:15:00,3472,haha holy moly the internet sure is fast.
738061,TJQ,2012-10-19 22:19:00,7806, OMG - what a crappy site!!!
738065,mike rousseau,2012-10-19 22:31:00,4661,  25-30 years.... From what I've read.... A fast growing musky can hit 50 inches in around 20 years....
