737903,kickingfrog,2012-10-19 11:58:00,8333,"Hwy 11 north, just before Orillia."
737904,BillM,2012-10-19 11:58:00,17367,Before or after Epps?

737914,BillM,2012-10-19 12:38:00,17367,Thanks Brian.
737436,Scott S,2012-10-17 22:58:00,203,Whats up with RacknReel in Barrie. Been there a few times to get minnows and she has been closed. What alternative is there thats close by. Scooter
737445,davey buoy,2012-10-17 23:08:00,5505, How close is close? Maybe try Innisfil live bait and tackle if your that way.#11 & #89. I'd call first.
737446,misfish,2012-10-17 23:08:00,29133,Jacobs my friend. HWY 11  Bang for your buck.
737463,Rizzo,2012-10-17 23:46:00,4754, ...just don't get on the wrong side of the lady up there...she's a real peach
737466,misfish,2012-10-17 23:59:00,29133," YA NEW LADY FRIEND.LOL  She liked me.  Must be the NEWFIE MOJO THANG.  Theres a joke for that,but not for this forum."
737468,glen,2012-10-18 00:04:00,2641,Get. Her when she is in her nightgown
737469,glen,2012-10-18 00:04:00,2641,Get. Her when she is in her nightgown
737476,Muskieman,2012-10-18 00:14:00,2472,"Every time I'm in Barrie ( quite often lately) I pop in to pick up a few things .. I always deal with a guy ... never met the lady , unless the guy is a lady ."
737477,kickingfrog,2012-10-18 00:15:00,8333,Dude looks like a lady?
737493,BillM,2012-10-18 00:59:00,17367,Rack and Reel usually closes up at 2pm weekdays.
737530,Rizzo,2012-10-18 02:23:00,4754," ...that's the last lady who always had a nightgown on. Let me tell you, that thing was worn pretty thin too...much too thin. She was always friendly at least. The new one makes it painfully obvious that you are a MAJOR inconvenience to her"
737569,misfish,2012-10-18 10:24:00,29133,Ya the first one. Bare foot and bareing .LOL
737573,12footspringbok,2012-10-18 10:42:00,459,Rack N Reel = a bad joke   Wish Lou still owned it.
737653,misfish,2012-10-18 15:19:00,29133,"I seen lou awhile back. I never knew that guy could smile.LOL  He seemed to be happy,being out of the bussiness."
737669,Scott S,2012-10-18 16:05:00,203,I've heard of that lady and her bare feet. I miss Lou and his signs he had up all over the store.
737678,12footspringbok,2012-10-18 16:49:00,459,"Never had a problem with Lou. Always had what you wanted for fishing the area. Fall time he always had the salmon lures I wanted, had a good selection of floats hooks mesh etc for rainbow fishing. I could go on. If there was a rod or reel you wanted no problems ordering it in. Now I have to drive to the city to get what I want. Canadian Tire south in barrie looks fancy but they still don't cut it....  Better stop the rant now...LOL  Jacobs for minnows for sure."
737708,davey buoy,2012-10-18 18:54:00,5505," Lou I liked,as you said most times he had what you want,but was not shy at telling you what you should do. Now kinda miss that after the fact. The lady there now is alright,but doesn't seem to have what"" I'm"" looking for,but usually try there first before elsewhere."
737709,NAW,2012-10-18 19:07:00,4022," Me too.  I try to support the local shops.  I've had a few morning coffee's with Penny.  She's a good girl, but the selection there has suffered for sure.  I've stopped in there on my lunch before and they where closed.  So I decide to take a walk around lake shore, and sure as   , there's Penny perching at the marina."
737713,davey buoy,2012-10-18 19:18:00,5505, She must have something else on the go..
737885,vince.bornais,2012-10-19 09:58:00,50,"She's a sponsor for the BFFF and she has no bait. She hasn't had minnows since last year, yet the guys at Hwy#11 & 89 have. I'm thinkin' she wants out of the business. It's too bad really because there is no other bait/tackle shop in Barrie now. You'd think that bait sales would make up a majority of her business?!"
737886,NAW,2012-10-19 10:29:00,4022," She went back to school last year.  The shop has been for sale for a while now.  She doesn't want to pile up the inventory, then sell the business, and make cents on the dollar. (I'm guessing  )"
737888,misfish,2012-10-19 10:47:00,29133,"And you wonder why Lou sold it. Even when he did own it,he was never overly busy. I dont think it helps being tucked away either.Location   There a story about that store and minnows,and why others have and it dosent."
737895,cheaptackle,2012-10-19 11:14:00,849,"""There a story about that store and minnows,and why others have and it dosent""  Inquiring minds want to know - so come on already, quit teasing!  Michael"
737896,NAW,2012-10-19 11:20:00,4022,"VHS?  I talked to Lou before he sold the place a few years back.  He said he didn't care if he made any money because he owned the building, and didn't have to pay rent. He just needed to cover the bills."
737902,BillM,2012-10-19 11:51:00,17367,"Brian, where is Jacobs? (I've never been) will be needing some big sucker minnows soon for eyes."
