736704,SirCranksalot,2012-10-15 23:18:00,3291,Nice wood plaque!!
736707,Handlebarz,2012-10-15 23:32:00,3790,I'm glad I got the scotch guard on the new couch I think I just peed my self if not from the animals then the beer cooler head mount. Great thread.
736708,skeeter,2012-10-15 23:41:00,1907,All those animals were not a taxidermy mishap. They were just neutered by a farmer with a pair of pliers.  Either that or they just saw Roy naked !!!!!!    :tease:  :rofl2:  :rofl2:
736712,Jer,2012-10-15 23:52:00,1426,  Oh my God...it's Kermit.
736774,livinisfishin,2012-10-16 01:30:00,661, Thats the best response so far!
736845,Moosebunk,2012-10-16 05:41:00,3970,Them's some freaky beasts.  Good laugh.  Thanks Craig.
736940,EC1,2012-10-16 15:08:00,930," I love that I thought ""stoned polar bear"" right off the bat as well!"
736946,jimmer,2012-10-16 15:21:00,2730,"I know Gary, I was a fellow member of the Canadian Taxidermy Association with him way back. A geat taxidermist and great guy."
736947,jimmer,2012-10-16 15:27:00,2730,"I remember getting a call from a woman once for a price on having her Rotty mounted. I gave her a price, but could hear her jaw hit the floor; she then asked how much for just the head. I asked her where she had the animal stored. She replied that it was still alive. Yikes. I then recommended that she hire a great photo person to take some great portraits off her and her pet together rather than have the dog mounted. Never heard from her again and I hope she followed my advice."
736948,Harrison,2012-10-16 15:29:00,2202,"Thanks Craig, needed a laugh.  Poor lion, can't wear a hat to hide that hair line."
737222,d_paluch,2012-10-17 03:19:00,343,haha  dear lord I actually cannot stop laughing at this thread. And that pike...looks like those spitting dinosaurs from the first Jurassic Park
737223,d_paluch,2012-10-17 03:20:00,343,** and that dinosaur would be a dilophosaurus   
737248,blaque,2012-10-17 12:05:00,2419,"How do you know these mounts werent done to animals with birth defects and/or deformities.......and the taxidermist just happened to capture them Bang On, HMMMMMMM??"
737257,azebra,2012-10-17 12:33:00,168,"Those made me rather ill, the first one was funny... Then it was all sick Hannibal lector stuff...... Not for me"
737293,Dave Bailey,2012-10-17 15:15:00,1641," Pretty sure that's the one in the nature centre at Restoule Provincial Park, I remember being profoundly embarrassed for them when I was there in August. If it isn't then it has a clone."
737303,mercman,2012-10-17 16:10:00,7054,Theres one in every crowd LOL  
737308,mercman,2012-10-17 16:16:00,7054,And....Last but not least. Rarer than the elusive Aurora Trout. Only one ever caught:whistling: 
736612,craigdritchie,2012-10-15 19:58:00,1586,"Bad taxidermy is one thing, but these mounts are truly epic. Enjoy.                                                "
736613,adolson,2012-10-15 20:01:00,783,Nooooope!  
736614,Squid,2012-10-15 20:07:00,1656,LOL that Owl looks really screwed up.
736615,Raf,2012-10-15 20:12:00,3495,"stoned polar bear rocks.  come to think of it, a lot of them look like they're using something or other."
736618,Donnie,2012-10-15 20:17:00,11,Oh dude i needed a good laugh today. That was hilarious!
736619,misfish,2012-10-15 20:18:00,29133, My thinking as well.
736622,jimmer,2012-10-15 20:26:00,2730,"Some of those look pretty old, but yes hilarious. The taxidermy field has come a long way since some of those were done. Love the nose on the cougar!"
736625,Joey,2012-10-15 20:31:00,9122,"LOL, thanks for the laugh.  Polar bear is my fave too"

736634,FishTracker,2012-10-15 20:44:00,47,Lol. Those are all hilarious! I think my favourite is the hippo!
736636,FishTracker,2012-10-15 20:46:00,47, Agreed! Photos and memories would better suffice.
736638,mercman,2012-10-15 20:47:00,7054,Love the 4th one:rofl2: Looks like he drank a dozen Red Bull!!!
736639,mike rousseau,2012-10-15 21:07:00,4661,"in all honestly most taxidermy i've ever seen anywhere in my life was poor quality in comparison to the work done by a local guy here... im actually shocked at the prices most charge considering the end result looks like a rubber toy...  this guy has a 3 year MINIMUM wait time for mounts... but its worth it for the fish/animal of a lifetime...  i had a largemouth done when i was younger... dad had a 54 inch musky done...a laker... 14 pound walleye... smallmouth bass... perch... crappie... pike... salmon... and my brother just got a 10 point buck that scored 150 done... all are amazing...  just thought id throw his info out there for anyone.... i dont know him personally... but IF anyone is gunna spend the big dollars to get a mount... id like to help you get the best for your dollar... i know if i ever get another mount ill be going to him....

736651,Christopheraaron,2012-10-15 21:59:00,3525,Same with the cat.
736652,mike rousseau,2012-10-15 22:01:00,4661,I think pets are sometimes used for beginners to practice...  Maybe?
736658,Toad Hunter,2012-10-15 22:08:00,261,"they all appear to be on bath salts, or maybe done by someone on bath salts"
736667,craigdritchie,2012-10-15 22:23:00,1586,"Mike's right - many of these animals were stuffed by people taking taxidermy courses. Sad but true fact - many taxidermy students practice on unwanted dogs and cats that have been put down by the local humane society. I guess it's a valid use of an animal that's dead anyway, but still creepy nonetheless.  But as the pictures above attest, some taxidermists don't get any better when they move on to paying customers' animals.  I look at these, and then I go look at Advanced Taxidermy's website ..... man it's scary how talented some people can be ..... and how scary other people aren't!"
736668,TJQ,2012-10-15 22:23:00,7806,"OK.. you think thats bad!! I caught this massive pike a few years back.    Long story short, an abundance of ""refreshments"" led us to eat the mammoth thing at hunt camp for supper (it did feed 13 guys!!) AND despite its size the cold water made it delicious... at least I remember it that way. Anyway the next morning all that remains was the head of the beast. So I froze it and brought it home to someone who was supposedly great at head mounts. Lesson learned.. always see examples of work before dropping anything off... lol.. or just spend the dough on a replica...  "
736669,Christopheraaron,2012-10-15 22:24:00,3525, Nice gator!     But where's the pike? LOL!

736677,mercman,2012-10-15 22:36:00,7054,  
736690,Rod Caster,2012-10-15 22:53:00,5784, That looks like one of those fish beerwarmers. I bet it gets a lot of laughs though.
