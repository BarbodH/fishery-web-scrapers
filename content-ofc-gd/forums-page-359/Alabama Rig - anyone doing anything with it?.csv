736552,chrismarkz,2012-10-15 14:43:00,20,"This guy seems to think a little differently then you......  Pro angler Paul Elias obliterated the competition in an FLW tournament win in 2011 using the Alabama Rig, catching 17 more pounds of fish than second place"
736566,BillM,2012-10-15 16:03:00,17367,"Another fad, it will die like the rest of them."
736568,Mike the Pike,2012-10-15 16:17:00,3421,tried this several times this summer and caught nothing  I will try it one more time this week.  so far I am not impressed
736581,Stoty,2012-10-15 17:25:00,2910,"ChrisMarkz... agree 100%. He caught over 102lbs of bass in a single tournament....  Mike - it's def more of a ""fall bait"" when the fish are schooling together chasing baitfish."
736620,ch312,2012-10-15 20:22:00,1590,it's already been said that they're nothing new and i think if they are that great than everyone would be using them. a pro having a lucky day isn't anything special. i'd think the only time they are useful is when fish are schooling and you can hook multiple fish at once and is probably why he won.  i've had a day or two when i slayed the smallies with a banjo minnow. i guess anything will work at one point or another
736662,Stoty,2012-10-15 22:18:00,2910,"Paul Elias Write-up  Breaking 100lbs for 20 fish and beating his nearest competitor by a mere 17 lbs....apparently he had a ""lucky"" 4 days....  There's a time and place for each lure, the Alabama rig is no different. I dont get why the A-rig gets so much more attention than any other bait. Most jerkbaits have 3 hooks, and can hook fish in multiple locations but its ""ok"" because it's a single body?"
737294,Harrison,2012-10-17 15:15:00,2202," ""Just more Stuff"" as Carlin would say huh.  Got a report from a friend who did well on the smallies with the rig on the Kawarthas using grubs.  Just getting me thinking about it, heading out friday and will give it a go too."
736087,Harrison,2012-10-12 18:05:00,2202,Anybody give the Rig a shot this fall yet?  I was thinking this may be a good time of year to give it a go when the bass turn to baitfish and school up.  It will be a couple weeks til I get out to give it a go.  Haven't heard to much going on with it.
736088,myot,2012-10-12 18:18:00,131,Used it to find some schooling bass on the weekend then fished them with a dropshoot rig and did quite well on Georgain Bay  Dan
736090,Harrison,2012-10-12 18:37:00,2202, Cool Dan.  So used it as a search bait.  Did you find they cooled off the rig or did you switch to the drop shot once you got bit?
736096,aplumma,2012-10-12 19:09:00,6896,I use it to cast in the calm evenings to pods of minnows and let it sink thru the school and get the fish down below.   Art
736098,BucktownAngler,2012-10-12 19:21:00,582,ive thrown it maybe twice this year. (no catches)  wasnt very high on my to-do list
736109,myot,2012-10-12 20:06:00,131,I was using the A-rig and my Brother was using a 1 1/2oz spinnerbait we double off the hop caught one more each then 5 or 6 cast with nothing then switched to the dropshot and laid a beating on them for the next 2h  Dan
736120,EC1,2012-10-12 21:05:00,930,"Threw it a grand total of once...Didn't get anything on it.  My conclusions about it - When it lands in the water, it sounds like a 2# bass jumping. Very hard to get feedback of what your baits are doing and when they are tangled.  I do want to give it another shot, but I don't know when that will be."
736126,manitoubass2,2012-10-12 21:26:00,11391, Musky bait!!!!!   
736144,Stoty,2012-10-12 22:51:00,2910,I'm def going to throw them in the next few weekends.... looking forward to it!
736145,Cudz,2012-10-12 22:53:00,2652,Was thinking of dragging it this fall for a short period of time.
736146,Christopheraaron,2012-10-12 22:54:00,3525,"ridiculously overpriced if you ask me, anyone tried making them?"
736154,BucktownAngler,2012-10-12 23:41:00,582, i bought a couple at sail around $8-$9 during their tax free sale
736158,Handlebarz,2012-10-12 23:53:00,3790,Etackle had them for a good price if I did more bass fishing I would try them. They were a lot less then the $20 I usually see them for that is pricy for 1/2oz lead and thin wire.
736176,Cudz,2012-10-13 01:49:00,2652,I saw a bunch at sail the other day for under $10
736178,Stoty,2012-10-13 02:03:00,2910,I carry a couple models as well.... $9.79 - $14.49 and have them in stock
736181,Harrison,2012-10-13 02:12:00,2202,"For those going to try them out please post how you do.  I've used them for pike in the spring and was impressed, but not for bass as of yet."
736290,EC1,2012-10-13 22:39:00,930,"BTW, here's a link from Matt Allen and he's great at sharing his tactics with Swimbaits and now the a-rig. He's from the west coast, and the stuff that he does to his rig seems pretty interesting.  EDIT: Added link. A-rig: Tips, tricks, tweaks"
736386,chrismarkz,2012-10-14 16:19:00,20," I picked up a few of these rigs this summer and wantedto troll them for GB skis this fall. The 32"" rig I removed all the hooksand put a release clip to the back line, so I can use a larger bait on the backstraight to my rod. the 22"" one I troll directly to my heaviest trollingrod removing hooks so I only have 4 hooks on the rig. I only used it for 2hours for the first time last weekend with no results, but next weekend I willput in a solid shift with it.    "
736398,Familyfisherman,2012-10-14 18:06:00,188,"I've thrown one on couch and Simcoe in the last couple of weeks...landed decent fish, no brutes.  I found they hooked the fish multiple times...good news is they don't come off, bad news is they hook fish in the eyes, fins, etc...not great.  I also lost one on a cast as it broke at the knot and just kept going...to the bottom in 20 fow...  I think they have a place for fish schooling on minnows for sure...but they aren't simple to store, damage fish, and are not cheap to buy and use...  For what it's worth...  For a tournament if you're sponsored you likely need to have one available, especially since they're newer and fish haven't seen them as much...they do work.  If you aren't and you're recreational...I'm mixed on it.  A couple of times I've had fish follow it to the boat, swimming right along beside it...that was interesting...seemingly no intention of hitting it..."
736407,Christopheraaron,2012-10-14 18:28:00,3525, they look cool but only 4 hooks/baits up here.
736414,Roy,2012-10-14 19:12:00,13728," They're certainly not new. They were around 60 years ago when I stated fishing. They'll drop out of the limelight and return as ""NEW, Never before seen, banned in 34 States"" bait in another 20 years.    Four hooks is all that one has, Chris."
736418,Christopheraaron,2012-10-14 19:40:00,3525, not the other.   
736449,Christopheraaron,2012-10-14 22:36:00,3525,"  Don't know how I missed that, sorry to the OP"
736543,ch312,2012-10-15 13:50:00,1590,i'm still chuckling at these silly thing's. they're just another example of a lure that catches more fishermen than fish
736549,fishindevil,2012-10-15 14:28:00,6254,"like roy said they are not new by any means !!! same as a dropshot rig,i have been using them for 30years,and some of the guys are saying the tangle,and do lots of damage to the fish as well...i will stick to my confidence baits,i do very well on mine...but i think they do have promise,for other species with some modification...."
