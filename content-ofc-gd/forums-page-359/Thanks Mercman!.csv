737552,Joey,2012-10-18 03:58:00,9122,That's awesome Ron.  Our members here are great  I also had a board member go above and beyond.  Fisherpete delivered an item he had for sale on the board classifieds as I could not pick it up myself as it would not fit in the truck with the cap or the van.  He graciously delivered and installed for me today and stayed for a nice yack.  Thanks Pete
