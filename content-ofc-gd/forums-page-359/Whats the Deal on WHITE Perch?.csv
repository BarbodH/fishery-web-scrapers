736812,Luke V.,2012-10-16 02:31:00,286,"Was out on Lake O on the weekend. Fishing for bass, we came off a drop off noticed a large ball of bait fish, marked big fish underneath. So down went the jigging spoons and up came white perch. I have never caught one before. Just curious if they are common in lake O and if they taste the same as a yellow perch. They were decent size 10-12 inches.  a pic just bcuz  Thanks for looking"
736815,northernpike56,2012-10-16 02:33:00,717,"yeah I've heard they are fine to eat, but I don't think I'd eat one out of lako Ontario, consumption guide says 1/0 for the main (western) body of lake O.  Matt."
736827,John Bacon,2012-10-16 03:12:00,3277,  I am not sure what they taste like but I believe they are actually more closely related to bass and sunfish than they are to yellow perch.
736844,bigugli,2012-10-16 05:27:00,6138,White perch are in the same family as white bass. Quite edible.
736884,Christopheraaron,2012-10-16 12:22:00,3525,"Cool, looks kind of like a bream. earlier  in the year bigugli had a report from that area with white perch so I don't think they're too uncommon."
736904,outllaw,2012-10-16 13:04:00,1232,very common in southern ont. as for table fare. theres far better eats.
736905,Rod Caster,2012-10-16 13:05:00,5784,"White bass from Nipissing. Not sure if this is the same as what you showed. Here, they are GREAT eating. "
736913,Luke V.,2012-10-16 13:24:00,286,"Rod Caster,  I do not think they are the same.  I probably wont be eating any of them being that they come from Lake O   Thanks for the replies everyone"
736918,craigdritchie,2012-10-16 13:36:00,1586,"White perch are very common in Lake Ontario. They belong to the same family of fish as white bass and striped bass (they have no relationship with smallmouth/largemouth, sunfish, or yellow perch whatsoever). Average size is 10 - 12 inches. They usually travel in large schools, so when you find one, you've found a bunch. They're pretty good eating fish but, as others have said, I would be cautious about eating much from Lake O."
