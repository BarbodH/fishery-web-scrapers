737262,lew,2012-10-17 12:43:00,12766,Fantastic work as always Chris !!
737312,Spiel,2012-10-17 16:24:00,9065,"Thanks everyone.  Just got the finish end wraps on.  While it appears bright now, it'll be finished without colour preserver which will have the garnet thread become quite dark, sort of like black cherry.   "
737320,John,2012-10-17 16:31:00,2956,Amazing work Chris. My mind boggles as to how many hours something like that takes. Then if you are like me..... break the dang thing and cry for a week!
737321,John,2012-10-17 16:32:00,2956, What does Ambrosia Maple look like Art?
737322,mercman,2012-10-17 16:34:00,7054,I am taking notes Chris. One day................................one day.Maybe:santa:  will let me have one too.  Awesome attention to detail.
737324,Spiel,2012-10-17 16:37:00,9065," Yep, a whole lot of wood thanks to you Sir. I'll be looking to get it stabilized at some point before using.    I can show you John if you're ever in the neighbourhood."
737522,Ron,2012-10-18 02:11:00,1683,"Very impressive Chris.  It just amazes me on how much talent there is on this web site, you being one of them. Where as I am only gifted or so my Mom told me."
736996,Spiel,2012-10-16 18:04:00,9065,"I've spent about 3 hours on this over the last few days while trying to keep up with other work.....  It was a special request from a good customer and while I hate doing it and I tried to talk him out of it he was persistent. So given that I've persisted in wrapping a four sided chevron in three colours, metallic black, metallic silver and garnet. The guides will incorporate the same colour scheme. Anyhow I've still much thread packing to do on it then finish it off with hook keeper wrap and far end wrap but here's where I'm at......   "
736998,solopaddler,2012-10-16 18:07:00,8605,"Nice work! You need a break though, I'm thinking Thursday."
737011,craigdritchie,2012-10-16 18:24:00,1586,"Aw come on Chris, why stop at the base and the guides? Wrap the whole rod from end to end!"
737013,Spiel,2012-10-16 18:27:00,9065," I'd do it for you Craig, lets talk money."
737015,davey buoy,2012-10-16 18:32:00,5505,"Looks great,if the customer is paying well it can't be to bad?.I like it!!!!!"
737017,kickingfrog,2012-10-16 18:41:00,8333,Just do it until you need glasses.... Oh? Sorry... Never mind.
737018,Duckie,2012-10-16 18:43:00,305,most things you do to your rod will make you go blind...
737019,mercman,2012-10-16 18:44:00,7054,Man !!! I dont know how you do it Chris.Just looking at the pic(very nice work BTW) makes my eyes cross:blink:
737020,fishnsled,2012-10-16 18:45:00,3520,WOW!! Nice work Chris!! Very cool!!
737025,Spiel,2012-10-16 18:54:00,9065, I said fishing related Rob.  But I do have an appt. for a new lens prescription as my current one is way out dated.....
737026,aplumma,2012-10-16 18:56:00,6896,You did a great job getting that decal on straight good Job Bud.   Art
737033,Handlebarz,2012-10-16 19:15:00,3790,Great work Chris
737034,Joey,2012-10-16 19:17:00,9122,"Wow, that looks amazing Hon!!!  Great job!"

737056,BillM,2012-10-16 20:04:00,17367,Is the customer Santa?
737058,Spiel,2012-10-16 20:05:00,9065," No, but you do know him Bill."
737059,kemper,2012-10-16 20:06:00,2232,"Insane Chris,  I can't imagine ever having the patience to do that. Not at all my style, but impressive work nonetheless."
737077,Spiel,2012-10-16 21:10:00,9065," Thanks bud, it'll be finished without CP which will make it a lot less dramatic than the picture."
737087,Bondar,2012-10-16 21:28:00,817,"NO NO NO , I said BLUE not red, do it again !!!!!  Nice work looks sharp !"
737091,Christopheraaron,2012-10-16 21:37:00,3525,
737107,Twocoda,2012-10-16 22:26:00,4130,very nice...it seems someone has made a commitment to a rod for the rest of his/her life...congrates whoever is going to own this...and grates on the craftmanship...  can wait to see how it finishes out
737193,Live2fish85,2012-10-17 01:38:00,1633,Chris that is amazing.  I think I know what I want for my next rod haha. Just kidding. I am not a big fan of it but then again seeing it finished fully with the rest of the rod could change my mind.
737227,MJL,2012-10-17 03:33:00,2427,"Chris, it looked amazing in person when I was there to see it yesterday.  I guess you can be rest assured that you won't need to do that on my next build...You may need to turn out some wood inlays for a handle though"
737229,BillM,2012-10-17 03:39:00,17367,"Mike, looking at those wraps gave me a mild case of epilepsy.  "
737254,aplumma,2012-10-17 12:15:00,6896,"  Rumor has it he has a box with some really cool pieces of wood ready to turn. Walnut, Ambrosia Maple, Cherry to name a few.    Art"
