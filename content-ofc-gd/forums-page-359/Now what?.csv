737710,NAW,2012-10-18 19:10:00,4022,"What kinds of boots are they?  If they are expensive boots, and worth the repair, then get them fixed.  If they're el'cheapo boots, then toss them, and get new ones.  There are lots of shoe/boot repair places around that can put a new sole on them for you.  I have glue soles back on boots before using this stuff.  I love it, use if for lots of things around the house.  http://www.loctiteproducts.com/p/sg_g_tube/overview/Loctite-Super-Glue-Gel.htm  Edit..  Just make sure you test the matierial first.  That stuff will eat clean thru some materials. (like foam)"
