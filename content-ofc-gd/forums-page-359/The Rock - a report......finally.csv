738013,Pikeslayer,2012-10-19 20:59:00,1443,"Well, summer/fall vacation is coming to an end and finally got around to do some editing. So here's a short clip (comments following)  <iframe width=""420"" height=""315"" src=""http://www.youtube.com/embed/Ko8hd5mBqnQ"" frameborder=""0"" allowfullscreen></iframe>   Highlights:The peoples (outside of 'the town'). Their hospitality and warmth.The Claddagh Inn (St. Marys). Patrick & Carol were the best hosts and ran the finest B&B we stayed at.The weather. Unbeleivable for the first week of September.Regrets:Bringing 'the ex' but her hubby is a long time good friend.Spending too much time in 'the town'. We were in St. John's for all/parts of 5 days out of a 7 day trip (did I say bringing 'the ex'  )Not booking 10 days (vs 7).Missing out on shark fishing out of St. Marys. I will be returning next year sans ex, hubby & wife to do so.The hurricane that wasn't. THEY CLOSED THE LIQUOR STORES.Missing a 'kitchen party' with my Aunt's sister (due to a funeral unfortunetly)Missing the sunrise @ Signal Hill. We were there @ 0500, but so was the fog.I did manage to bring home a chunk of salted meat (forget if it's beef or pork) and a pudding bag. I NEED A GOOD RECIPE FOR JIGS DINNER (Brian ????).All in all, I have to say it's been my favourite Canadian destination to date (been to all Canadian provinces coast to coast).Had a blast and looking forward to returning  Edited to add; Though Porter Airlines had by far the best price, they don't fly direct. Even though we were the originating flight, never had to de-plane and short 15 minute stops, we flew via Ottawa, Montreal and Halifax to St. Johns. Left me with one numb     Next time, direct flight regardless of cost."

738032,Pikeslayer,2012-10-19 21:40:00,1443, Playtex glove in Dildo Harbour (not joking) Joey. Don't want to know what it was used/needed for    the bleeding came as a result of the ex's hubby daring rock climbing. I saved his life BTW
738034,misfish,2012-10-19 21:43:00,29133,"CANADA BEGINS HERE,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,  Great shots Simon. Did ya get a feed of chips and dressing?  How did you like the fine knife work?

738037,nofish4me,2012-10-19 21:48:00,404,"I agree 100%, it's a great place. I was there 2 days after the Big Blow.  I found your video interesting, no need to make one of my own. Hahaha  I was in most of the same places and took the same pictures. Signal Hill, Petty Harbour, Cape Spear... Did you try any Partridge Berry's or go to Cape Race?  I'll attach a picture of sunrise at Cape Spear.   "

738069,misfish,2012-10-19 22:40:00,29133," If he had taken the ferry accross to the Bell,he would of had the best at Dicks."
738084,nofish4me,2012-10-19 23:12:00,404,"  I can't argue that, I've not ever had anything from Dicks, but have you had fish and chips at By The Beach?"

738110,captpierre,2012-10-19 23:52:00,2521,Nice.  Took the family (5 of us) and van about 8 yrs ago.  Spent $700 on the ferry there and back.  Tried for Atlantics on the Humber River.  Barbless flies only and foreigners need to hire a guide.  No fish but a good time.  Gotta go back to get skreeched in.

738175,Pikeslayer,2012-10-20 13:43:00,1443,"Pretty sure you know my neighbourhood Brian. One of your old go to's is just around the corner Yep, salt of the earth just about covers it   They don't serve Pinot Grigio there   We were supposed to meet Susanna & Gerald on the Bell but someone passed away and the funeral was the day of our visit. I was game to attend the wake but 'you know who' nixed it."
738194,lhousesoccer,2012-10-20 15:51:00,442,Isn't a kitchen party and a funeral the same thing on the Rock!?!
738197,misfish,2012-10-20 15:59:00,29133,"Simon,if you buy a small bucket of Navel beef,make sure it,s the one with the red lettering with the NFLD iland onit. There are others,but they have salt pellets in them and makes the meat way to @#$@#@$ salty. Garbage. The one I speak of,the meat is in a brine only.  "
738259,misfish,2012-10-20 20:41:00,29133,"Simon,can ya tells,what on the menu tonight?      I like mine baked now.    Got it yet?   Awaiting the finish."
