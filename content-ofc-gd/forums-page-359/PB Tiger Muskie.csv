737207,backbay,2012-10-17 02:29:00,773,"Just beautiful, Congrats!"
737210,4x4bassin,2012-10-17 02:42:00,1025,Nice one
737218,hotsky,2012-10-17 03:13:00,400,Nice fish. What lake tho?
737233,ProFishermanJones,2012-10-17 07:40:00,77,Very cool tiger! & an awesome fall picture as well. congrats on your catch
737237,solopaddler,2012-10-17 10:37:00,8605,"Beautiful fish for sure, wow! I vote for renaming that fish. A cross between Musky and Pike should be called Mike."
737241,Roy,2012-10-17 11:36:00,13728,"A truly beautiful specimen, Pete. Congrats to you. It's not everyday you'll capture a tiger and especially not one of that size.   Yes, they grow faster than muskies but never attain a true muskie's full grown size. They are sterile. Many US States stock tigers but I don't know if OMNR has a stocking program for them. I don't think so but I'll check."
737251,BillM,2012-10-17 12:07:00,17367,"Man, those are some great looking fish!"
737253,lew,2012-10-17 12:10:00,12766,"Really beautiful fish Pete, I never got a tiger myself but would be nice to get one even just for the picture."
737265,Walleye'm Fishing,2012-10-17 12:50:00,310,What a beauty!!! Congrats dude.
737534,Fisherpete,2012-10-18 02:29:00,1814,"Thanks everyone! It is my 3rd tiger this year, but the others were much smaller fish. I caught 3 last year as well. They have absolutely ridiculous sets of teeth on them, and this specimen was no exception.  Here's a couple shots of the set of teeth from a 36"" tiger I caught last year, weapons of mass piscatorial destruction!    "
737536,4x4bassin,2012-10-18 02:33:00,1025,"That's crazy Pete , freshwater barracuda"
737537,ehg,2012-10-18 02:34:00,2666," That is a real nice fish. Odd that they are called Tiger Musky. They seem to have stronger pike characteristics, with the fins, colouring and such.  Only good thing about pike entering Balsam. Beautiful fish!"
737640,mepps,2012-10-18 14:39:00,1301,stunning fish Pete!
736976,Fisherpete,2012-10-16 16:47:00,1814,"Got out on Saturday despite the crappy weather and caught 3 muskies, a 32"", a 33"" and this 41"" tiger which is a PB for me. The tiger followed my friend Patrick's lure out from a weedbed... I got her on the follow up cast    Tigers have to be one of the prettiest freshwater fish - just awesome markings, and man what a set of teeth on them.    "
736977,I'mHooked,2012-10-16 16:50:00,525,Hey beauty fish! Hoping to hook into something like that this weekend!  Thanks for the pics.

737075,captpierre,2012-10-16 21:00:00,2521,very cool.  There is something called hybrid vigor.  I wonder if they grow faster than a muskie.  Anybody know if they can reproduce?
737078,Slop,2012-10-16 21:12:00,151,Groovey green sheen...a darlin!
737081,Skud,2012-10-16 21:15:00,739,Absolutely gorgeous!

737089,Jigger,2012-10-16 21:33:00,1237,My favourite! Awesome fish Pete! Congrats on a beauty!
737116,mercman,2012-10-16 22:39:00,7054,"  As far as i know, Hybrids like this cannot reproduce.From what i have read, they are sterile."
737123,Rich Clemens,2012-10-16 23:02:00,3131,Beautiful fish.    Congrats.
737128,cram,2012-10-16 23:08:00,1733,Super pretty fish. Have never caught or seen one in person.  Are their teeth bigger?  I have seen people refer to their teeth but never knew if there was a difference.
737130,mike rousseau,2012-10-16 23:24:00,4661,Very cool fish
