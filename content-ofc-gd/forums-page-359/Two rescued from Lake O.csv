The men were fishing off the coast of Toronto Island’s Gibraltar Point when their 34-foot Bayliner power boat began taking on water at around 10:45 a.m., police say. Recgonizing imminent danger, the men sent out a mayday call over their marine radio and then climbed into a life raft. By the time a rescue boat with the city’s marine unit arrived at the scene 15 minutes later the Bayliner had sunk. “It was gone. There was just a chair and some stuff floating in the water and obviously the raft with two guys inside it who were wet and pretty shaken up,” Const. Danny Phillips told CP24. “If they hadn’t had that dinghy they would have been in rough shape. The water is only eight or nine degrees and it wouldn’t have taken too long for the situation to get pretty grave.” The men were examined by a medical crew once they returned to shore, but were deemed to be unharmed. Police say they will not recover the boat from the bottom of Lake Ontario.   Read more: http://www.cp24.com/news/two-men-rescued-after-boat-sinks-in-lake-ontario-1.1003704#ixzz29re5reDH"

738223,woodenboater,2012-10-20 18:53:00,2277,I'd imagine insurance will recover and examine why the boat sank and proceed from there re:coverage. Wonder how deep it is 3 miles off the Islands/Hearn/Ashbridges ?
738225,BillM,2012-10-20 18:57:00,17367,3 miles off the island is way over 200ft.    They'll have fun recovering that boat (If they even bother)
738226,kickingfrog,2012-10-20 18:59:00,8333,"Ya, that's likely to be structure now."
738232,woodenboater,2012-10-20 19:16:00,2277,"Thanks for the info.  So now I wonder how much a new 34' Bayliner costs ? Also, was there a plug they forgot about on that boat ? I mean why else, barring insane waters, would a boat decide to visit Davey Jones' locker ?  -just looked at the Bayliner site and the only thing in that length is a cruiser starting at...$153 742 (prolly USD).  OUCH !"
738275,Fisherman,2012-10-20 21:06:00,7201,"Honestly don't know if boats that big have a plug or not.  I'm thinking maybe a cooling hose that gave up for the motor(s).  But, you would think there's be an auto bilge at the least with an audible alarm.  They must have been paying attention      or maybe engaged in unknown activity."
738287,lew,2012-10-20 21:33:00,12766,"Whatever the cause, it's good to hear they got out safely."
