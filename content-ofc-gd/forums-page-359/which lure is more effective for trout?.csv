737951,Duckie,2012-10-19 15:25:00,305,"what, in your experience, is a more effective casting lure for browns/rainbows: small spoons like smaller cleo sizes or in line spinners like the mepps aglia and black fury?  a friend of mine asked me the other day and I didn't really know. I have caught trout on both cleos and rapalas, but never spinners.  but I know people catch lots?  thanks for any suggestions."
737957,Christopheraaron,2012-10-19 15:51:00,3525,I'll always be reaching for spinners and rapalas over spoons!
737959,Rustic-Fisher,2012-10-19 15:57:00,826,"Spoons, they cast further(most)  thus covering more water,  equaling more hook ups. R"
737964,Christopheraaron,2012-10-19 16:16:00,3525," But I fish smaller, clear streams, so I prefer a finesse style."
737965,chris.brock,2012-10-19 16:18:00,4053,"in the creeks (not at the mouth), I like spinners, Colorado blade, casting upstream,"
737968,SirCranksalot,2012-10-19 16:24:00,3291,A friend of mine has good luck with Blue Foxes. I have better luck with Cleos than I've had with Foxes.
737972,Rustic-Fisher,2012-10-19 16:45:00,826,"In smaller streams, spinners would be the ticket R"

738165,davey buoy,2012-10-20 12:04:00,5505,The #2 and#3 silver blue fox vibrax spinners seem to do very well.
738166,dave524,2012-10-20 12:13:00,4508,"In lakes I generally will use spoons, in streams I generally use spinners. Really it is more an issue of depth control, spoons will get deeper in a lake and spinners are more easily worked in skinny water of a stream."
738179,kickingfrog,2012-10-20 14:06:00,8333,"Looks like I'm on the band wagon too. Although that doesn't mean I won't use spoons ""upriver"" or spinners at the mouth. It's more of a general starting point, and I will use plugs in both areas as well."
738182,Snidley,2012-10-20 14:48:00,620,It's really depth control and speed of retrieve. Using a baitcaster vs a spinning setup will make you speed control much more effective because with the baitcaster you can actually feel the correct speed that gives the best action on your spoon or the optimal rotation for your spinner.
