736183,ketchenany,2012-10-13 02:26:00,3229,Looking for tires for my Jeep Compass -  215/60/R17 - all season or advice  .  . . Installed.  I'm in Woodbridge. Will travel an hour or so away. I've seen posts over the years . . .  Thanks   A
736184,BillM,2012-10-13 02:38:00,17367,"Al, cheapest thing to do is drive over to Buffalo, get new tires installed and drive back.  Even with the price of the trip, it will be lower then buying them over here."
736187,Cudz,2012-10-13 02:53:00,2652,Yep. If not try costco
736188,ketchenany,2012-10-13 02:55:00,3229,"Thanks B, I was close last week visiting fishing buddies and after I walked through FDRs garden in Ridgeway my  thoughts were there as I looked over Lake Erie. But if 'she' finds out then it will cost me more ""can I come shopping""  . .  ."
736189,BillM,2012-10-13 02:57:00,17367,Ahhh..... then the trip costs increase!  LOL!

736217,Raf,2012-10-13 13:15:00,3495,"check costco or the paper for any current deals  i know firestone had a decent deal on their tires recently, maybe it is still going on.   i am real happy with my destination A/T tires.  the destinations are well rated and come in a H/T tire as well."
736252,rmarentette,2012-10-13 18:13:00,124,"My son bought four tires for his Compass at Costco earlier this year. They were Bridgestone Turanzas 215/60R17, and he paid $659.00 installed and after a rebate of $79.10 the total cost was $580.05. He's very satisfied."
736253,GBW,2012-10-13 18:27:00,8460,I know this is ODD but Ford's running ads right now as the best price tire guys.  if not costco for sure.  I can check with steelcase tire n' mag too if you want Al.  Woodbind and Steels area.

Just send a request with your size, and he will get back to you pretty quickly.  He put a set of Yokohama Avid Envigors on my Subaru for $600 ( they lasted 65km before a guy tee boned me as he ran a red). They were 205/55/16's. Saved me a few pennies from Going to Costco plus I got the mail in rebate at the time"

In will follow up with him for now, but I have emailed other contacts that other members have put forward in this thread. all of you have been most helpful, thank you.  Any typography problems I'm here!"
