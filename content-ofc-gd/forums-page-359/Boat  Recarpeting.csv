736887,bassinator,2012-10-16 12:30:00,32,"Hi all...my 2002 17' Starcraft is in desperate need of recarpeting. I live in Brampton and not interested in travelling too far to get the work done. If anyone knows of a reputable place I could take my ""baby"" I sure would appreciate it. Also I know it's a little hard to estimate what it will cost without seeing the boat but any ballpark figures as to what it might cost?? Thanks Again...Jeff"
736979,pylon,2012-10-16 16:56:00,68,I have an 18 foot bow rider   $100 for the carpet and $40 for 2 quarts of glue. All water proof stuff. an afternoon and a knife is all you need use a tile thinset trowel to spread the glue
736981,ah_long,2012-10-16 17:07:00,354,Go to bbcboards and look at their restoration section
737134,fish_fishburn,2012-10-16 23:33:00,1311,I had a estimate done in 2006 for a 19ft bassboat and it was 1200-1500 bucks. The reasoning was it was a very labour intensive job. I bought the material required for about 200.00 and did it myself. It turned out awesome but I put in about 60 hrs of labour to do it right.
737169,hirk,2012-10-17 00:53:00,571,"I did a 18' bassboat and it took 19 hrs., but I saved $1,000 so it was an easy choice. I had never worked with carpet of any type but it was easy and turned out mint,just use the old pieces as a patern and make sure you run the nap in the same direction."
737239,Billy Bob,2012-10-17 11:19:00,5865,"  SEE........that's why it took you so long.......you napped too much on that job.....  I agree with the others........it's a do it yourself project...not hard, just time consuming depending on how much sleep time you get in...  Good Luck, Bob"
737258,bassinator,2012-10-17 12:36:00,32,Thanks guys...thought that it might be too big a job for me but you may have convinced me to do it myself. Thanks again for your replies...Jeff
737405,pylon,2012-10-17 21:10:00,68,If your really not sure about fit  take some paper and make a template. Dry fit the carpet (or flooring) roll it up from the bow back 1/2 way then glue it and roll it up from the back and do the rest
737420,Guest ----,2012-10-17 22:07:00,0,I did my 17' tinner about 5 years ago. It is definitely a job you could handle yourself. Took a while to remove all the panels and consoles but it was fairly simple. Keep your old carpet if you can to make a rough template when cutting the new stuff. Make any final adjustments once new is in place. Giver
737421,moxie,2012-10-17 22:09:00,1566," I've been down the re-carpeting road as well and would agree its a fairly long process but besides the savings ($150 Total) there is a certain sense of accomplishment in knowing you did the work yourself as well as getting acquainted with all the under deck mechanics of your boat.. With that being said if you decide you don't want to take the task on Lakeview Marine in Manchester (Port Perry) offers upholstery services but I'm not 100% sure if re-carpeting is offered as part of the package. I can tell you that having dealt with"" Brandon"" and the crew at Lakeview on a number of occasions, customer care is priority one. You can reach them at 905-982-0300. Good luck."
