603331,Broker,2011-07-16 13:39:00,482,Im wondering how to catch trout in the grandriver without a fly rod. I heard theres some near york
603377,laszlo,2011-07-16 18:45:00,487,The water is way too warm there for trout right now.
604163,fish_finder,2011-07-19 00:01:00,370,"Yup, way too warm down there for trout.  You might have luck a little further upstream towards Paris/Brantford, but that would be tough too.  Head up to Fergus/Elora area if you really want trout on the Grand this time of year"

604490,BillM,2011-07-19 20:57:00,17367, Isn't that section C&R only?
604492,Bill Shearer,2011-07-19 21:06:00,456,I guess if you don't get caught it isn't an issue?
604514,fishin jesus,2011-07-19 23:02:00,53,its single barbless catch and release only !!!  it's ignorent people like this that makes me sick !!   Tightline......is a poacher !!! KNOW YOUR REGULATIONS!!!!
604550,wallacio,2011-07-20 00:06:00,475,Easy guys...C&R regs do not apply between Tower St and Scotland St in Fergus (ie where Tightline is referring to).
604551,irishfield,2011-07-20 00:08:00,26272, 10 posts here and you're calling someone out.. NICE !
604564,tightline,2011-07-20 00:49:00,322,"Completely legal catches. Know YOUR regs floatman and fishing jesus!!! Fished the grand for 30 years and maybe take home that 2 a year, jump on somebody when you don't know what your talking about..."
604572,bushart,2011-07-20 01:07:00,2628,Man That's Brutal---Take it easy tightline---every now and then this nonsense where someone wants to try to make someone feel like a criminal.  You kept a fish!!!
604767,fish_finder,2011-07-20 16:15:00,370," Exactly,  nor do they apply in the conservation area in Elora, and several of the bridges have kill zones for several meters upstream and downstream.  Not like it matters really.  The most common catches in those kill zones are dinks that are stocked every year."

737721,Christopheraaron,2012-10-18 19:43:00,3525,"Ok, but isn't trout still closed? don't see an exception to that..."

737780,Live2fish85,2012-10-18 22:00:00,1633, Are you asking if they are closed on the grand river right now?
737796,Christopheraaron,2012-10-18 22:29:00,3525, Just noticed how old this thread is LOL! Nevermind.
737807,Live2fish85,2012-10-18 23:09:00,1633,Yea trout are still open on the grand though in certain areas.
737822,Christopheraaron,2012-10-18 23:43:00,3525, I was just responding to the elora comment but that doesn't matter anymore
