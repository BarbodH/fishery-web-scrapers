If ever I've needed fix for repair questions answered, this board always came through for me.  The past 5 years hasn't been so good for me and I'm finally getting myself back on my feet. It's been a rough ride.  So I decided to give myself a treat and decided to get back into boating/fishing again. I've just purchased a Stratos 217f powered with a Evinrude 115 Intruder.  The boat is fully loaded. It comes with a Minn Kota Terrova 80lb with i-pilot ,Lowrance LCX-28C on the console, X102C up front, a Lowrance flasher in the Dash.. Onboard 3 bank charger and Raker SST prop.  I'm heading down first week in November to pick it up... Can't wait  Has anyone ever had one of these boats or fished out of one ?  Let me know your thoughts.  Tiz  "
