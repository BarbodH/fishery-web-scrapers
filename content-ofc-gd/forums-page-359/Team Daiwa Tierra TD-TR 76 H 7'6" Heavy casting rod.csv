736758,Christopheraaron,2012-10-16 01:12:00,3525,"Looking to get a basic musky rod, something under $50. I found a Team daiwa tierra TD-TR 7' 6"" H on kijiji and since I know nothing about musky rods I was wondering if it's worth the trouble. If anyone has other suggestions I'd love to hear them!"
736783,Christopheraaron,2012-10-16 01:40:00,3525, I've got an Abu ambassador it has 30 lb PP right now and was going to change it to 65 PP. What do ya think?
736811,Christopheraaron,2012-10-16 02:29:00,3525," I do have a tendency to backlash, of course with musky baits you can just tighten the brakes right up. I don't know the size, rod's in the garage right now, I'll see what size it is in the morning."
736911,Christopheraaron,2012-10-16 13:17:00,3525,"Couldn't find the size. I also just found out the rod is telescopic, usually I would never put up wit a telescopic rod because it just feels too flimsy, what's everyone's take on them?"
736969,hirk,2012-10-16 16:20:00,571,"Thats a bass rod your looking at but it would work as a ""3 iron"" musky rods if your not throwing really big baits"
736982,Christopheraaron,2012-10-16 17:20:00,3525,Do you have another suggestion?
737074,hirk,2012-10-16 20:57:00,571,No other than if you want it just for musky you would be better to get a musky rod
737088,Christopheraaron,2012-10-16 21:31:00,3525,You know where I can get a rod for under $50? I can't find any other then the BPS but those are also more bass rods.
737185,Gregoire,2012-10-17 01:23:00,1397,"You could look at the rapala magnum line of rods which you might be able to get for about 50 bucks, but they are only 6'9"". Bass pro does make a line of musky rods, and they are around 50 bucks, but they are only 7ft long at the max. I would hesitate with using a bass rod to throw musky baits, unless you plan on keeping the lures on the small size, 2 oz and under. If I were you I would wait until you could up your budget to 70 or 80 bucks and get a used shimano compre or st croix premier."
737196,Christopheraaron,2012-10-17 01:47:00,3525,"I don't think I'm going to get it, I just found out that it's only rated for up to a 1/2 ounce lure. What about the musky ugly stik, they have them at bass for $40."
737204,Gregoire,2012-10-17 02:18:00,1397,"The ulgy stick is a great entry level rod and is nearly indestructible. That would be a good rod to start with, but it is a bit short. If you plan on throwing bucktails you may want a longer rod to make the figure 8 easier."
737211,Christopheraaron,2012-10-17 02:45:00,3525,What about the catfish ugly stik? I would prefer something about 8ft.
