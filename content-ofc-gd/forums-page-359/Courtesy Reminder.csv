735922,bubbles,2012-10-11 19:33:00,591,What Lew said.
735928,jimmer,2012-10-11 19:52:00,2730,"Haven't been to a river in years just for the reasons stated. Won't go either, because others will laugh at my relic equipment now. I did enjoy watching a shoreline/bank scuffle the odd time as long as no one got hurt. LOL"
735987,SirCranksalot,2012-10-11 23:38:00,3291,"Well, yes and no. As a percentage, no, but there's 1-2 km of relatively fast water in the park.   "
735989,BillM,2012-10-11 23:44:00,17367, I rarely make it down to the bottom end
735993,kemper,2012-10-11 23:49:00,2232," I know it is full of fish, but MAN is it painful to watch a float move that slowly..."
735994,misfish,2012-10-11 23:49:00,29133,"I,ll be fishing with a good friend this weekend.If he feels the need to ""GREASE ME"" I,ll under stand."
735999,Salmonidstalker,2012-10-12 00:13:00,265,"Kemper, early season/low water, you're going to concentrated guys on every river, every day. And that means combat fishing sometimes. Take it with a grain of salt.  Lets be honest, most guys don't know how to time rivers properly anyway. A nice cold snap + good down pour + perfect timing and you'll have no one in sight. Even in some the most popular east tribs, I've had the rivers to myself on a weekend because guys just don't time it right.  Have a good chrome season, it should be a banner year on all tribs."
736021,GBW,2012-10-12 01:54:00,8460,Did u get his number?
736029,Twocoda,2012-10-12 03:19:00,4130, He might not have because he thought you were already in a relationship
736058,GbayGiant,2012-10-12 13:15:00,1780,Kemper. If this river fishing makes your life so miserable that you think posting something like this will make your worries go away you should take up Bass fishing instead. Don't let your day be ruined. Walk away and try another river.  or stay and fight.  
736059,FUSION,2012-10-12 13:44:00,81,
736084,kemper,2012-10-12 17:45:00,2232," Day was far from ruined, lots of fish still made their way to the bank!  I'm a finance guy - my skill with words doesn't always put forth the tone that I intend. There was some sarcasm and feigned exasperation hidden in there - in all honesty I was mostly in awe of the situation and how fast this addiction has spread.  No worries Gbay, I do bass fish but they don't seem to co-operate with me the way that trout do..."
736094,shane,2012-10-12 18:48:00,652,"  Or take up carp fishing. Fight just as hard and, this time of year, probably taste better."
736173,GBW,2012-10-13 01:37:00,8460,"Ouch,,,, PS, yes I LOVE cocha"
736198,Twocoda,2012-10-13 04:55:00,4130, All in jest Goeff..i couldnt resist...
736218,Billy Bob,2012-10-13 13:15:00,5865, Nice list........these and some others are the reasons I purchased my first boat 40 years ago....
736251,GBW,2012-10-13 18:12:00,8460,"Oh know, just google what I posted...."
736277,misfish,2012-10-13 21:10:00,29133,"Terry tried to grease me out today,but I put a stop to it.    I said,,,,,,,,,,,,,         NOT WITH THAT PINKY.  I threw an orange worm over his line,that fixed that.   :rofl2:  :rofl2:   I understand the rant Kemper, and I to don,t like to be pushed out (guess greased,is the new word) it is what it is. Deal with it in your own way. Me,walk on and fish."
737817,porkpie,2012-10-18 23:30:00,2521," The golden age of steelheading in the Great Lakes was 20 years ago on the US side, before every Canadian found out about it.  Sorry that you missed it!  I am happy for the fond memories, but am glad I was there then and not now.  By now the Yankees have been watching us and figured out how to catch the things, and it is no longer a secret to Canadians.  What you see down there now is a shadow of its former glory!"
737935,Billy Bob,2012-10-19 13:43:00,5865,:rolleyes:
737938,solopaddler,2012-10-19 13:59:00,8605," I didn't miss thing, trust me on that. ""The US side""? The U.S. side of what? Obviously you're referring to Erie and Ontario's south shore. Steelheading doesn't revolve around that area, there's plenty more regions that offer much more.  In general, across the entire great lakes the runs of fish and the amount of opprtunities that are available have never been better.  I think perhaps you need to broaden your horizons."
735751,Terry,2012-10-11 00:03:00,14456, yeah cause muskie people don't get bent when boat stops within a 100 ft of them or if they don't have a net or if they hold the fish wrong or if they hold up a small one for a picture or take the time to get the hooks out rather then just cut them or if thy toss it back in the water rather then holing i in the water till they swim away on their own.........yes so much more mellower then the river rats  lol  
735765,SirCranksalot,2012-10-11 01:01:00,3291,Another solution---get a canoe. You can access areas that are otherwise hard to get to.
735766,kemper,2012-10-11 01:12:00,2232," I think you can blame Mike for that term, around here anyway.  Flexible term, means that some goof decides he wants to fish exactly where you are and proceeds to do exactly that."
735771,irishfield,2012-10-11 01:42:00,26272,  Maybe it was that Axe body spray....
735773,kemper,2012-10-11 01:51:00,2232, You could try swinging a spey rod around? I've noticed that nobody comes near my when the big stick is chucking intruders...of course I'm probably in grave danger the entire time.
735810,solopaddler,2012-10-11 12:04:00,8605," HAHA! I had only ever heard the expression once before used by my buddy Andrew many years ago. I'm not claiming it as mine but I definitely took it and ran with it. LOL!  For those of you who are getting tired of using old expressions like ""rube"" and ""loogan"" consider using ""huckleberry"", another one that Andrew coined on a busy day at Elk.  As in ""Holy Crap! I can't believe how many freaking huckleberrys there are on the river today!    It's a multi purpose verb.  "
735813,lew,2012-10-11 12:09:00,12766,"You make musky fish'n seem very boring by comparison Mike, we don't have any of them fancy dancy words"
735821,torco,2012-10-11 12:33:00,656,"  Hahaha, nice."
735822,fish_fishburn,2012-10-11 12:34:00,1311,Out on the west coast they call them BEEKS or Beaks not sure on the spelling.
735824,solopaddler,2012-10-11 12:36:00,8605," The words are easily transferable from steelhead to musky Lew, and as Sinclair has demonstrated to the gym as well.  Speaking of the gym I tend to go at the same time everyday and many of the same people are always there.  While on the eliptical machine yesterday minding my own business a woman who I like to call the old sea hag stepped on the machine to my direct left.  Apparantly the sea hag had just consumed 3 full cloves of garlic before she started huffing and puffing right next to me.  I tried to endure the stench but eventually I couldn't and was forced to leave.  So I guess I was greased out too."
735825,Harrison,2012-10-11 12:40:00,2202, Some say you attract the company you keep.
735836,BillM,2012-10-11 13:56:00,17367," Lew, this is why some of us wait for the cold weather of late Oct/Nov to really start hitting the rivers.  By that time the salmon are done and are most of the people chasing them.   A little courtesy goes a long way on the river, just have a wee bit of respect for your fellow angler and everyone will get a long and have a good time."
735863,Hairpy,2012-10-11 15:42:00,73,"Too funny Mike , I haven't talked to Andrew for awhile , hope he's doing well.  There are lots of places to go and have some solitude , just doing a little research helps and so does a canoe.    Joseph"
735867,BillM,2012-10-11 16:03:00,17367, ....or just looking at the filename of your picture.
735872,12footspringbok,2012-10-11 16:11:00,459,"Yes fall river fishing is a terrble thing I should quit too...  This morning was the last straw. I was fishing away and a pair of mallards tried to ""grease"" me out. Then a beaver thought it was ok to swim across the river right where I was fishing. To top it off a flock of noisy geese flew over me...   "
735873,BillM,2012-10-11 16:15:00,17367," Should have shot them all (sans the beaver, lol!)"
735875,12footspringbok,2012-10-11 16:32:00,459, Didn't buy my migratory license this year...LOL
735879,Toad Hunter,2012-10-11 16:48:00,261,"ive never tried this - then again, when i hit a river (usually the grand or speed) its for smallies (and the odd over ambitious snot rocket) ..."
735881,solopaddler,2012-10-11 17:11:00,8605,"  Nice picture Joe, let's try and get out together sometime this fall."
735882,Musky or Specks,2012-10-11 17:16:00,2710,A buddy of mine has an open kayak and this is a preferred method of his when fishing that river
735888,SirCranksalot,2012-10-11 17:33:00,3291," Any points for correct answers here? That looks like just down from the canoe launch (in your Old Town canoe) with the fast water just ahead!  When I fish this river I usually use the canoe mainly to get me to uncrowded spots, then fish from shore."
735894,GreenCanada,2012-10-11 18:07:00,375,"My favourite is when I'm fishing with my spinning rod. I'll be on a river somewhere without anyone around me, tossing a spinner or crankbait. Then someone shows up planning to drift, right above me, trying to grease me out. In that situation I don't mind crossing their line and pulling it in. I'm not typically twit-for-tat, but if you see someone fishing there already and your style of fishing will prevent them from continuing to fish, move on to a different stretch or get there earlier."
735906,torco,2012-10-11 18:42:00,656,"Recently did the canoe thing on a popular river with my brother inlaw and it worked out great. We used an inflatable canoe and parked one car at the start and end of our drift. We fished from the canoe and got out and waded, rarely saw anyone on the trip."
735910,manitoubass2,2012-10-11 18:56:00,11391," Why not just give it a few little twitches, you know, just to watch them set the hook on nothing, lol.  Oh wait, then you would be no better then the other dood hahaha   "
735914,BillM,2012-10-11 19:15:00,17367," Not much fast water in that river, lol."
735670,kemper,2012-10-10 19:57:00,2232,"Seems some people could use it...  A large number of people can fish a stream as long as we all co-operate.  It's pretty simple, everyone drifts in unison and we all get along.  I was greased out today three times, by three different people who all knew better.  1) Casting UPSTREAM far enough that you cross the line of the guy who is two places above you is excessive. Stop doing that.  2) Yes, I did just hook a fish in that slot. No, I would prefer if you didn't cross me up twice while standing in my back pocket so you can get a drift too.  3) Hey buddy across the river, I realize that I'm all of 30 feet from you and I'm hard to see (?). Please, for the love of roe bags don't bounce your float off my knees again - the water is two feet deep. I see the bottom. No salmons there.  I can put up with people standing all over me as long as they stay off my line.  I'm used to this crap from fishing out East, but I would have preferred to be at the Ganny during the salmon run instead of the Northern river I drove a long way to today.  On another note - has anyone noticed a marked increase in the number of fish going on the rope recently? Of the 20 or so bows that made it to shore today the ONLY ones that went back in the drink were mine. I get it, they are tasty and I'll never say anything to people keeping a legal limit - this is more of a general concern. Why do so many fish need to be released into the hot oil bath?  /rant"
735675,lew,2012-10-10 20:10:00,12766,"I'm sure glad I never took up river fishing, seems all you guys ever do is fight & argue amongst each other."
735678,kemper,2012-10-10 20:13:00,2232," Unfortunately Lew, that's about right.  Seems like it's been getting worse too. I don't get into it on the river, if someone wants to grease me out I just move on to another place.  I have been known to stir the old pot online from time to time thought..."
735680,irishfield,2012-10-10 20:18:00,26272,Hasn't changed much I see... why I stopped doing the stream thing over 27 years ago.
735682,lew,2012-10-10 20:22:00,12766," I guess I understand where your coming from Kemper, but from the stuff I read around here it just doesn't sound like an enjoyable way to fish to me. Seems like there's just constant complaining about so many different things associated with river fishing, from snagging, to flossing, to poaching, to guys gutting fish for the roe and 100 other things.  And heaven forbid somebody mentions a river or posts a pic and there's a dozen guys ready to hang him for it.  I'm not trying to stir the pot, it just never sounds like fun to me, but I spose everybody has their own thing to do....and I'll stay out on the lake where it's nice and peaceful"
735683,crappieperchhunter,2012-10-10 20:23:00,2582,Thanks for the reminder of one of the reasons why I have not had my river gear out of the house in over 2 years. I perch fished yesterday with a buddy and never even saw another fisherman.
735684,kemper,2012-10-10 20:25:00,2232," Believe me, I'd love to be out on the lake too but on a student budget that just isn't in the cards.  When you can find a piece of water that doesn't look like the circus came to town the river bank is hands-down my favourite way to fish. Once it gets cold the idiots go into hibernation and the rest of us can get some real work done."
735686,solopaddler,2012-10-10 20:39:00,8605,"   Well I for one don't fight with anyone and there's certainly no need to have stopped stream fishing 27 years ago.  We live in what is without a doubt the golden age of great lakes steelheading. The amount of opportunities available and diverse fisheries is amazing.  The experience is what you make of it.  If I have a choice I'll never subject myself to crowds, there's absolutely no need.  On most of the rivers I fish there's plenty of room to spread out. On many of them you won't see another soul all day.  Of course I'm a vagabond, I'll drive anywhere for a day or two of fishing if conditions are prime.  I currently have licenses for Ohio, Pennsylvania, NY and Michigan in addition to ON, all just to fish steelhead.  I can understand where Brady is coming from though. If I lived east of T.O and fished the crowded rivers out that way on a regular basis I'd lose my mind LOL!  The best way I've found to combat the invasion of anglers out that way is to fish at night. The fish do bite quite well at night and there's no one around."
735687,torco,2012-10-10 20:40:00,656,"Kemper its always a problem, the fact that it is wednesday and you still found it busy is even more a alarming. You are right though the cold and the rain should hopefully drive people away.  I personally can't fish in that tight quarters anymore even with basic etiquette. I'm off to Thunder Bay this weekend hopefully its less busy way up there."
735688,kemper,2012-10-10 20:41:00,2232," Hey Mike - out East I just put my combat gear on and get to it, but I've never dealt with shenanigans this bad up north before. Seems like everyone with a tuna rod migrated..."
735690,solopaddler,2012-10-10 20:46:00,8605," Well depending on what river you're fishing a bit of footwork or a move to another river will leave the crowds behind.  If one, for example, chooses to fish the Beaver right in Thornbury then one shouldn't complain about crowds.  But then I'm not telling you anything you don't already know."
735691,kemper,2012-10-10 20:52:00,2232," Indeed.  Are you still off galavanting the globe for salmon sized brookies?  Its been a sad scene all over so far, I crossed the Saugeen last weekend and didn't even get my knees wet..."
735693,davey buoy,2012-10-10 20:55:00,5505,I have seen it. But never been fishing in a place that bad. I don't think It's going to get any better soon. I think the extra leg work would put you beyond the hooligans. .And a better chance at fish as well.!!
735694,kemper,2012-10-10 20:58:00,2232," Sometimes it will, others not. I've already notched 2 trips this year that tipped the 750km mark - unfortunately can't make that happen every weekend.  Once we get some rain I can go back to wandering into the bush until I'm alone"
735695,solopaddler,2012-10-10 21:02:00,8605,"  No galivanting, but I am planning next years trip.  The geen is low right now, no doubt about that."
735700,Twocoda,2012-10-10 21:22:00,4130,Dont you mean Saugeen Creek?  Lew  one or two bad apples doesnt ruin a bushel....but they make the headlines
735704,esoxansteel,2012-10-10 21:29:00,1307,"I dont much like the crowds either, so i will generally move to lesser crowded areas, but when my thyroid gland is hyper-active like its been, im like the tazmanian devil, and have no problems getting into a scrap, and actually enjoy it, and im knockin on 50, and no Whisky is required, but that certainly adds to the excitement, and enjoyment."
735717,lew,2012-10-10 21:54:00,12766," I hear ya, just too much squabbling among the river crowd for my liking though."
735718,misfish,2012-10-10 21:54:00,29133,"YA,Im not into arguing with these donks. I dont mine walking.Better waters to be found always. And like Bill said way back,once the cold weather comes,you get the real die hards. This is my first fall,and I have to say,there are many ignorant greasers. What ya going to do."
735720,Musky or Specks,2012-10-10 22:11:00,2710,Dang if the geen is so low I might hit it up for Ski's this weekend
735721,craigdritchie,2012-10-10 22:12:00,1586,"Exactly why I avoid the crowd altogether. It's a lot more fun to fish out-of-the-way spots that may not have as many fish, but do have far fewer people.  Like Mike, I have fishing licenses for a whole bunch of different places. I have no problem filling the truck with gas and driving several hours in order to catch some fish in peaceful surroundings that also happen to preserve my sanity.  My time is valuable. I'd rather spend more of it driving and have really good quality fishing when I arrive ... than stay closer to home and waste an entire day in a circus with all the clowns. Fewer hours on the water, but better hours on the water. Quality over quantity.  Jut my two cents."
735722,kemper,2012-10-10 22:19:00,2232," Agreed - 100%  Hey guys, we made it to 20 posts on a thread about bows and no punches have been thrown yet"
735727,Harrison,2012-10-10 22:46:00,2202,"Month or so and my long rods come back out, then go back in Feb.  I sense the frustration Kemper, like sitting at black jack table when the ancho hits on 12 with a dealer six showing.  Stay and deal with it or move  on."
735745,hirk,2012-10-10 23:51:00,571,"Yup I packed it in myself almost 30 yrs ago,stayed with the brookies for a few more yrs but just cant deal with all the clueless jokers. I get more pleasure walking the east creeks watching guys fish than I possibly could fishing them myself,and yes I know lots of pools not too busy but still doesnt cut it."
735746,adempsey,2012-10-10 23:53:00,1498,"What exactly does ""greased out"" mean anyway?  You Steelheaders and your funny lingo."
