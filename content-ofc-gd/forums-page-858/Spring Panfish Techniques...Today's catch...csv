334720,The Urban Fisherman,2009-04-25 21:14:00,2050,"Hit the reservoir one last time this morning, and decided to do a more in depth report than ""went out with the kid and smashed them""  So, as most of you have seen, these past few weekends I've taken my daughter out to fish early season Panfish from shore.  I've been landlocked seeing as our second child is due anytime.  Anyways, the panfish trips, albeit from shore, are a nice way to get into the swing of things, and to get some good eatin' fish early on in the season.  This fishing is probably one of the easiest ways to get kids into the sport, but can also be a ton of fun for the seasoned angler as well.  It's not all dew worms and red bobbers.      Quick and simple, look for warm water, with submerged cover, that has easy access to deeper water and you should find fish.  Creek mouths, with early growth vegetation and submersed brush or fallen tree's are good places to start as well.  Don't forget to keep your eyes peeled for beaver huts, as they've been very productive for us this season.  The crappie will be looking to start their spawn, and although bluegill don't spawn until a little later in the season, they'll be holding in similar areas.  And hey, you may even catch the odd bonus fish, like Averie's first encounter with a rainbow trout.    Technique #1:  One of the best ways to quickly find these tasty, and feisty little fish, is to cast or slowly troll micro crank baits.  Most people prefer tiny spinner baits, but I just find that cranks have out-performed spinners for me in the past, and tend to get more hook-ups.   Well today, one of my first casts out, I snag a tree, and lose the only micro crank I packed.  If I was in my boat I could just head on over and get my bait back, but oh well.  In the past I've used Mini Rapapla's, as well as BPS brand micro cranks.    Dumbass Tip #1: Always pack more than one crankbait, even when you're hauling everything in by foot....even with a 2 year old on your shoulders.   So much for plan ""A"".    When the fish are on, there's no better way to catch Them.  Also, the plus side of crankbait fishing for panfish, is it's a big fish technique.  You spend more time fishing for keepers, and less time taking tiny fish off your line.  Which brings me to technique #2.  The good old Berkley Powerbait pink trout worm under a slip float.    This bait is hard to beat for spring panfish, the only down-side is you better be willing to weed out the small ones.  After about an hour of fishing I must have caught 50+ fish and only had 4 keepers.  As soon as your bait hits the water the little 3""ers  hammer it.    If you're out to get your kids into fishing, this is the way to do it, but if you're out to bring home some eaters, you better have patience.  We forgot our pliers this morning, which was BRUTAL.  Try getting a #10 or so hook out of a 3"" sunfish's mouth.  Not an easy feat.  So Dumbass tip #2: always bring your needle nose pliers.    Once the kids are satisfied that they've caught enough fish themselves, and are busy playing with the fish you've put into a livewell, or cooler filled with water, you can go back to fishing a crankbait, or throwing some larger soft plastics.  Technique #3:  Something I stumbled upon this year was wacky rigging tiny senko type worms.    Fishing them weightless, with NO FLOAT gives you one major advantage, you're always going to end up in the strike zone at some point during the cast.  With spring gills and especially crappie, If you're bait isn't at the right depth, they often won't hit.  It might be just under the fish, or a little to high to bring them up.  With this rig, you just toss it out and let it slowly sink to the bottom.  This way, no matter what the magical depth is, your bait will eventually be in their strike zone.  When you're float fishing you have to constantly move your bobber stop.  Maybe you set it to shallow, then to deep the next cast.  With this set up, if there's fish in the area, you're going to get a bite.  Another advantage is that, because you're using a bigger bait, with a bigger hook, you tend to zero in on the bigger fish.        Anyways, we've taken home a few dozen panfish over the course of the last few weeks, learned a few things and made some solid memories.    So do yourself a favor and take a kid out panfishing this season, I guarantee you'll have a lot of fun, and you might just find a new early season species to target.  That wraps up my ""haresting"" for the season.  I'm having a baby (hopefully soon or my wife is going to snap) and once that settles it'll be pike action on the bay until bass opener.  I know this stuff is all pretty run of the mill info for most of you guys, but my intention is to help out some of the younger, or less experienced members of the board.  Or maybe even to get some of you guys to try something new.  As usual, have fun, and be safe.  Cheers, UF"
334728,jediangler,2009-04-25 21:53:00,1923,Great informative report. The smiles on the faces of little ones make it all worthwhile.
334729,EC1,2009-04-25 21:54:00,930,Awesome report and nice pictures!! Glad you're able to take your two year old daughter out fishing so much
334756,The Urban Fisherman,2009-04-25 23:24:00,2050," Thanks dude.  I figured I've been panfishing a lot more since my daughter was born so I might as well share some of the things I've learned...   I get that from my friends to, but when they're out ridding their street bikes, or drinkin' corona's by the pool, we're out chasing fish! I'm just lucky she loves fishin' so much.  Thanks, UF"
334767,Marko,2009-04-25 23:48:00,854,"Great report man, the smile on their faces says it all. Those bluegills, are they any good to eat?? I know a pond that holds a few, never brought any home to try. Do they taste like perch and crappies??"
334771,Fudd,2009-04-25 23:55:00,94,Top report and pics... you have yourself a great little fishing buddy there. There is nothing better than seeing the enthusiasm and smiles. Thanks
334775,Leecher,2009-04-26 00:04:00,7832,Great report and pics UF Your little one is turning into a pro at catching them good looking pannies  Good on ya for taking her out and congratulations to both of you  Thanks for sharing this wonderful time with us!!! Leechman
334781,smokin joe,2009-04-26 00:18:00,226,Thank you UF for the informative report and the pics.  And thank you for sharing you and your daughters time fishing
334789,bigugli,2009-04-26 00:47:00,6138,They go great  with bacon & eggs for breakfast.
334801,Mike Pike,2009-04-26 01:31:00,1332,"That's a great report and instruction, Urban.  And some really terrific Panny pics!  I haven't seen anything better in magazines!!!  Thanks and congraturlations on your other fisher-kid on the way!"
334824,The Urban Fisherman,2009-04-26 02:19:00,2050," They're just as good if not beter!  We had a crappie and gill fish fry last weekend and just mixed them up.  Nobody knew the difference.  Good fish for somebody who doesn't like fishy tasting fish.  I only keep them early in the season when the water is still cold though.  The meat is much firmer and has no worms.  Cheers, Uf"
334827,Dusky,2009-04-26 02:33:00,310,Thanks for the tutorial and congrulations on finding such a cutie fishing partner:)
334941,Marko,2009-04-26 13:32:00,854,"Thank you for replying guys. I will give that a try today, assuming it does not rain."
334946,Greencoachdog,2009-04-26 13:42:00,8163,Excellent report and pics Urby!!!  Those are some beautiful slab Gills and Crappie!!!
334947,The Urban Fisherman,2009-04-26 13:45:00,2050," I wouldn't say the pix were as good as magazine pix, but thanks man!  I took the ones of myself with a mini tripod I got at dollarama.  I do like the colors on the Pumkinseed though.  Same as any fish, stick them in the livewell for a few minutes and the colors come out on them.   Here's a good video I found on cleaning them.  If you're used to just slicing from the gill plate back to the tail, then removing the rib cage afterwards, that works fine for them as well.    cheers"
