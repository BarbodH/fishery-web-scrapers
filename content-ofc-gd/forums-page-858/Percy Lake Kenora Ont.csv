STOCKING LIST FOR PERCY LAKE AND EMERSON LAKE"
335293,Jeff S,2009-04-27 03:09:00,5,Limeyangler  ok that is different info then what I got. Looks like they (MNR) does a stocking of these lakes every two(2) years.  Guess I will have to head out on days off and play on both lakes to see how they fish.  Thanks again for the reply  Jeff
