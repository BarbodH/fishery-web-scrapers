335027,grt1,2009-04-26 17:47:00,638,thanks for the help. it appears that BPS is just up the street from where I'll be staying . Maybe I'll have to visit my aunt more often. from the map it is the same distance as what i have to travel to pick up my mail each day so i can do quick trips to the store. I guess the next problem will be getting my purchases home.
