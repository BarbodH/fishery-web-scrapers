335113,Joey,2009-04-26 22:23:00,9122," Sorry, thought everyone was watching the race.  Carl Edwards just flew into the fence at Talladega in an unbelievable finish."
335115,Joey,2009-04-26 22:28:00,9122,Here's a recap someone put on Youtube.  Carl Edwards into Fence
335120,Drew_10,2009-04-26 22:58:00,111,"Carls' strategy didn't work out too well.  Hung out at the back of the pack for the entire race, even loosing the draft at one point, all in hopes of missing the wrecks.  He gave it a good run though and came close, good to see him walk away unharmed."
335185,Daplumma,2009-04-27 00:58:00,1961,"I'm just about done with plate races,what a bunch of crap.I will say that Mikey did a good bit of wheelwork today to stay off the wall.Other than that it was pretty boring.Untill the final laps. Joe"
335302,oxcowboy,2009-04-27 03:25:00,544,"i guess a few fans were hurt slightly by some debris, but man it could have been alot worse if that retaining fence hadnt held up.  very glad to see everyone ok after that.  props to edwards for doing his best ricky bobby impression to finish out the race.  jason"
335310,Twocoda,2009-04-27 04:03:00,4130,Ricky Bobbys version was better....lol
335410,misfish,2009-04-27 14:19:00,29133,"Edwads showed class,when he didnt blame Brad.He knew he was blocking and came down to late. Very terrifying forsure.Glad he wasnt seriuosly hurt.  I thought JR had it,but that train of Carl and Brad was simply amazing.I thought forsure JR would of seen them coming and went up to catch thier draft.  As for plate racing I aggree.Exciting for the fans,but very dangerous for the drivers.  Yes MW made a great save.Best driving he,s done in a few years.LOL"
