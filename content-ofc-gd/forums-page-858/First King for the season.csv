Grimsby, started 6am trying to beat the bad weather and we managed ...up to a point for the firs couple hours than it got ugly and we went back. Marked lot of fish but not many takers and no bait balls. Fished in 50 fow anywhere from 20 to 45 feet down. Spoon bite...Michael Jackson did all the hits today. Hooked 3, lost tow and got the first one in the boat. Got a bit wet on the way back but hey...it is part of the game. Few pictures:      Cheers, Ice Fisherman"
