Went to the next spot, same thing, looked and looked all over the bay wondering where the heck they could be. Finally realized that the water temp was only 43 to 46 degrees, they haven't come into the back of our lake yet!! Damn. Tried until about 10:00 and pulled out and went to Simcoe for some Jumbos. Got into about 2 or 3 hundred fish by the time the afternoon was gone, kept about 20 for a feed. I was so looking forward to a Crappie feed, gonna try again next Sunday.. Didn't bother taking any pics, just wasn't in the mood after the no Crappie thing... What were the temps in other lakes like??"

335002,JeffBornFishin,2009-04-26 16:01:00,260,Had a couple of light hits but no fish landed.  Got off the lake when the thunderstorms kept rolling through and the wind picked up.  Still nice to get out

I'm thinking  of calling in sick one day this week so we can try again but the weather looks pretty cool for the rest of the week.  newifieman"
