334596,jediangler,2009-04-25 03:22:00,1923,Went to Guelph lake conservation area as today was their opening for the season. Fished from 1:30pm till 5:30pm catching one small hammerhandle pike and this carp.  It was 26 inches long and pulled my kayak for 20 yards before I could land it. I also found this jitterbug hanging in a tree. It'll need some new hooks but it'll cover the $4.25 cost of admission to the park.   Had a little trouble with high winds at the start but after a short rain it calmed down nicely. Glad I decided to bring the rain gear.  They are doing a demo day tomorrow and Sunday for Swift canoes and kayaks if anyone is interested.

334718,pokerdemon4,2009-04-25 21:08:00,135,Excellent job Jedi.  Nice looking lure you found. Great setup you have there.  I hope to go to Guelph lake for some crappie soon.  Thanks for posting.
334786,hammercarp,2009-04-26 00:41:00,964,Great stuff. Imagine what a thirty would do when the waters warmer. Talk about a Nantucket sleigh ride.
334793,Leecher,2009-04-26 01:04:00,7832,"Great report and pics jediangler  No need to ask you what kind of fight you just had on hooking this brute from that statement ""It was 26 inches long and pulled my kayak for 20 yards before I could land it.""  Congratulations on landing this beauty carp Thanks for sharing Leechman"
334799,iCarp,2009-04-26 01:29:00,50,"Great looking carp, there, and a great ride by the sounds of it.  Congrats!  What did you catch it on?"
334806,jediangler,2009-04-26 01:46:00,1923,I was using a 1/16oz jig & grub combo that I covered with some old Dr. Juice scent for walleye that I had in my vest from almost 20yrs ago. I knew it would come in handy some day.
334809,The Urban Fisherman,2009-04-26 01:55:00,2050,"That carp must have been fun cathching it out of the yak!  Were you targetting carp or was it an incidental? I used to have a heck of a time trying to land them from my personal pontoon.  Cheers, Uf"
334819,jediangler,2009-04-26 02:14:00,1923,"I was out trying for crappie, but found a bunch of carp and suckers in a hole up a creek arm, so I broke out the old scent bottle and went after them. It is the third and smallest carp I've landed in a kayak. Can't beat them for a great sleigh ride."
334847,Marko,2009-04-26 03:23:00,854,"Those carp will hit on anything at times. Nice healthy looking fish tho, they pull like there is no tomorrow."
335358,jediangler,2009-04-27 11:49:00,1923,"I'm still surprised how few people target these fish. In most Ontario water bodies, they are the hardest fighting fish."
335361,Marko,2009-04-27 11:53:00,854,I`ve heard stories of some big carp being caught at Guelph lake but i have never seen one swimming around and we used to go there at least once a week just to bbq and hang out. Its probably not targeted as much because its considered as a garbage fish in some circles and its less attractive then pike or bass or trout. Love chasing them personally and always give me a run for my money on lighter tackle.
