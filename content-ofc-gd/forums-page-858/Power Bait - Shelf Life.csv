335139,MSBruno,2009-04-26 23:46:00,369,How long should an open package of Power Bait be sitting in a tackle box until it's discarded?
335144,MCTFisher9120,2009-04-26 23:51:00,3761,I think powerbait is pretty safe even out of the package completely. It's the Gulp/Gulp Alive products that need to be in there purchased packaging.

335274,CLofchik,2009-04-27 02:51:00,854,"If you're talking plastics, I've got half a pack of twister tails that are still Power Baitish after a decade.  If you're talking that floating dough that comes in jars six months tops (killer fall brown & bow plunker bait btw)"
