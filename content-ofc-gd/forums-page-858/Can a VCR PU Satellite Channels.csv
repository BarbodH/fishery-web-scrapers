335381,holdfast,2009-04-27 13:03:00,1813,I tried tuning my VCR for Satellite channels but only picked up two.  Is it possible or how on earth would a VCR with 120 programmable channels sort through 800 Satellite.  All I want to do is be able to record Satellite channels.  I'm thinking maybe I need a special VCR or it doesn't work like it does for Cable in which I had no problems tuning in.

335385,JohnF,2009-04-27 13:10:00,3494, I thought you had to tune in the channel with the satellite decoder. I believe I've heard of dedicated satellite digital recorders that can be set to record something other than what you're watching but never a dedicated vhs unit.  JF

335399,bigugli,2009-04-27 13:40:00,6138,A VCR is one of them thingamajigs us older types cling to because we have hundreds of VCR tapes that would cost a small fortune to convert or replace. Same kinda idea as the phonograph and LP records.
335405,wallyboss,2009-04-27 14:13:00,1095,LP records?????   Are those the big black cd's????
335456,irishfield,2009-04-27 16:36:00,26272, It's the unit right beside my 8 track  player Raf !!  Channel 3 or 4 to match the VCR as previously stated.

335471,bigfish1965,2009-04-27 17:17:00,3382,"Just make sure the line goes to the decoder THEN to the VCR...if that doesn't work, the VCR may be incapable of receiving a digital signal...depends on how old it is.  I miss my old beta-max."
335491,desship,2009-04-27 18:08:00,96,I run two separate cables from satellite receiver. One to Tv and one to VCR then to TV.There are different inputs on TV.When I want to record just set to ch3 on VCR and program it to record at whatever time. Make sure you set satellite to come on to your program you want to record .If you want to save on cable just run 1 cable to VCR the output of VCR to TV. you do not have to have VCR on to watch satellite program.
335511,Terry,2009-04-27 19:22:00,14456,yup put vcr on whatever channel the sat receivers output is 3 or 4 if you use cable you can also use rca input and you would put vrc to record whichever input you are using
