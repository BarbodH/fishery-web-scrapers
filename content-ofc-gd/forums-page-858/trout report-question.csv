Although we only caught one fish between the two of us (me) lol, a 12 inch rainbow that fell for a mepps aglia chartreuse #2 with a dressed hook. We were there all day and the weather was nice but the wind really affected our trip. We fished all day from noon till about 8 PM but then the weahter got bad so we decided to pack it in. We headed pack to my place and had a little fish fry. No pictures left the camera at home since i was expecting the rain. Lastly i have a question, we saw many trout jumping and when i caught the one trout my spinner was near the surface does this mean the fish are suspended, and if so what are some good techniques for catching suspended trout?  Thanks in advance  Marcin"

335246,bassmaster4,2009-04-27 02:26:00,801,yea but my fishing outfit isnt really good for flies because its a spinning real and would be hard for me to cast out would i be okay if i added a small sinker to it?
335275,kickingfrog,2009-04-27 02:52:00,8333,Can only speculate. If we assume the fish were trout they:  Could have been chasing minnows near the surface.  Hitting insects near or on the surface.    Spinning tackle options if the above speculation is right:  Try floating minnow baits and keep the lure near the surface.  Small poppers or the like.  A small fly tied to the back hook on either of the above or with a small float.    If the fish are really zoned in on a particular insect it can be hard to get them to hit anything else.
