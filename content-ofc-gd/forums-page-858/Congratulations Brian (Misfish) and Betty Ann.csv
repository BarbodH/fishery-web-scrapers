335069,Joey,2009-04-26 20:07:00,9122, Oh WAH  Hangover all gone now?
335071,irishfield,2009-04-26 20:08:00,26272,"Thanks Brian and Betty for sharing your 27th with us... from a couple that will hit that number as well in August.  A rare occassion in todays society!  Mr and Mrs Blowes    Linda, douG, Leah and Joey    Paul (Tybo) and Terry    The man of the hour Misfish (most of his late night babbling on OFC should stop for a while now...    )    The ""gang"".    Now with 3 hours to kill what do OFC'rs do... lol  Got some strange looks and even some comments on the dock. Joey just put them straight..""we're killing time"" !    Yep.. she can read a book anywhere. Not many wives out there that would do this... guess explains how we've survived 27 years as well ! lol (I asked if she wanted me to bring a rod and she said no... I don't want you upset that I caught more fish...    I caught 10 or 11 of these. A couple a good size.    Joey got into a few... but with the high winds almost got blown off the dock in this outfit    .. so had to go get changed!    About 4:15 the sky got ugly and we bolted for our vehicles and drove over to the banquet hall to wait for dinner time. Rain almost stopped so we lent Paul some cover...    Lets get this party started..    Rob (memart) and his wife Anne?    I missed what was said.. but they were probably making fun of me or something...or Paul ! lol    Paul and Joey takin a spin    I'll work on that video now...."

The vows were at Barrie City Hall at 2 p.m. and the reception was at 5 p.m. at the Army Navy, so we had a few hours to kill.  So what else were we to do...........  We had great company with Wayne, Leah and Terry.  We were definately the best dressed on the pier                      Okay, big storm came and we had to hide out in our vehicles for awhile.  Then on to the reception.  It was still raining a bit when we beelined it for the hall.    The man of the hour!    Wayne and Brian's brother Rob (Memart)      Cake cutting time.  Brian and his beautiful bride Betty Ann.    First Dance.    Wayne and Leah getting Jiggy.    Brian Busting a Move       We had a fabulous time Brian, thank you so much for the invitation.
