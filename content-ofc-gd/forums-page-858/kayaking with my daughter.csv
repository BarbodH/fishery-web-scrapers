Had to be a little creative to get both kayaks on top of the car for the 45km trip to Guelph. Looks funny but was stable up to 80km/h.  Once she got in the water I had a hard time keeping up to her.  She enjoyed weaving through and under the tree trunks.  She has had several hours of kayaking, but has never tried to fish out of one before. Like all of us, she had trouble controlling the yak while casting.  We decided to keep going farther up the creek until it was less than 2ft deep. Then we parked the yaks and she began fishing from shore.  After 20 minutes she managed to hook and land this sucker, but would not hold it up for a picture. We started the trip at 10:30am and fished for 2 hours before calling it a day. We knew that thunderstorms were in the forcast for the afternoon and wanted none of that. Great day out with my new kayak fishing buddy. I didn't even make a cast but didn't mind a bit."

AS to not making a cast, when fishing with children, you are not fishing, you're instructing, and vicariously getting the pleasure of fishing."

WTG gurl, hey bro we need to get her a pink fishergirl hat like her aunt wears. In no time she will be gracing the pages of our fav fishing mags."
