334960,Sandman0007,2009-04-26 14:22:00,2,Hey Guys I need some advice on the correct way to replace rivets on my boat. Its my first time so im not to sure how to replace them. So my question is Would the washer end be at the bottom of the boat or on the inside?. Thanks In Advance..

335075,Pigeontroller,2009-04-26 20:21:00,2793,Take it to a marina/boat dealer!

335094,irishfield,2009-04-26 21:14:00,26272,I have nothing wrong with the second rivet from the left...it's a sealed tank rivet. But if you can access both sides do it right and use solid rivets.. not pull rivets. Driving/bucking rivets isn't a mystical science..... heck even I can do it !
