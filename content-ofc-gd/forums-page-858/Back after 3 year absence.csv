335221,RoyL,2009-04-27 01:51:00,26,"Hi guys,  I've been gone from the board for a few years. Moved from the Oshawa area in summer 2006 to Verona, about 20 minutes north of Kingston. I used to fish Lake Ontario Salmon for years. Now I'm still getting used to this area, traded my 27' salmon boat down to a 16' aluminum with a tiller 25hp, and it's panfish in the spring and bass in the summer.  I have been gone from the board since then for two reasons, 1) this board is heavily oriented to Toronto / Lake Ontario / Kawarthas / Muskoka and  I didn't have much to add about this area 'cause I was still learning it.  Bass fishing is great here.  We'll go out at 5:00pm, fish until dusk, and if we haven't boated more than a half dozen 1-3 lb fish between the two of us, it has been a very slow evening -- but it's a long wait until the end of June. I'm looking forward to getting out hunting for crappie this week. If anybody is interested in conditions down here, I'll post a report.  Two things I'd be interested in hearing about. Hay Bay is about 40 minutes away, I've heard lots about it, but haven't had a chance to fish it yet. Would love to correspond about conditions there. I think Walleye season opens May 2. Need to find a boat launch (preferably free public one with parking) and talk techniques. i.e. I hear a lot about trolling there, but also that it's weedy ... how do you combine the two? or are the weeds not up yet?  Next goal is to find some big pike. Other than the occasional decent one (lots of hammerhandles around), that's something missing from my fishing experience. I presume they're hiding out north of hiway 7 (again 40 minutes away).  Looking forward to contributing again.  Roy"
