335212,daking_eh2007,2009-04-27 01:37:00,31,Need help in finding a professional installer to install a minnkota bowmount trolling motor to my bayliner boat. Please let me know of any recommendation. Thank you.  
335218,Greencoachdog,2009-04-27 01:46:00,8163,"Mount the motor as close to the ""nose"" of the bow as possible!... following the mounting instructions would be good!!!  ... keep the ""shaft"" of the tolling motor parallel to the port or starbord sides of the boat when stowed!   ... maybe this will help eh?"

335339,lew,2009-04-27 10:49:00,12766,Might make it easier for folks to recommend an installer if you told us where you live  Ontario's a pretty BIG place
335369,tschirk,2009-04-27 12:28:00,261,Contact Bayliner. They used to make a contoured Aluminum bracket for the Bow. I have one on my 2000 model 1804 Fish n' Ski. Cheers Ted
