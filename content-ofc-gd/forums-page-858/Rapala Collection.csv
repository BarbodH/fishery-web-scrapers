My best Buddy who I grew up with in Montreal, who I havent seen in a dozen years or so, but we still remain in contact, sent me these photos that I requested.  When we last spoke he told me that he started collecting old and rare Rapalas,  he does a lot of this E-Bay buying and selling which I thought was only Robert Bateman prints.  Wow, was I surprised by these Pictures and he also is now starting to collect old Mitchell Reels  He tells me that he might even be given a job as a Rapala Rep in BC.  Anyways here's a few Pictures he sent.           He Says.... The one with the Jointed double Red head, There were only 1200 made for the European market, He has 4, They were made in Finland quite a few years ago...Try & find one today!!     His Mitchell collection    Im sure hed love to hear from anyone who shares the same interest."
