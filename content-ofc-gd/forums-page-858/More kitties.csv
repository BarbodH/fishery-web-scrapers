335229,bigugli,2009-04-27 01:55:00,6138,I wasn't sure I was getting out today. It was grey and a raw wind from the East. Did another road cleanup instead and decided on a nap. By 3 the sun was shining and the wind dying so off I go. The rains stirred things up real good. Took a while to figure the bite. Today's mix of baits were cutbait and worms.    I was surprised to have this fella hit a worm.   Went 5 for 7 in the 4 hours out this evening. Don't know what the last one was. Probably another big carp. He took off and never slowed down. Spooled me in all of 2 minutes.
