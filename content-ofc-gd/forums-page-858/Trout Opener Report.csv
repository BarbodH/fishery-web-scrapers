Not my ideal time, but I didnt do too poorly.  I drove about an hour out of town and remembered I forgot worms... woohoo.  Lucky for me, I had my vest with pinkies and some select flies. I landed about 10 fish in the 6-8 inch range and 6 in the 8-11 inch range.  I ended up bringing home 4 fish around 8-10 inches, looking forward to cooking them up in a bit!!  I caught my first 5 fish on the pinkies, the rest were on an olive wooly bugger.   first fish of the day   trying the macro on a small fish... kinda funny lookin   beauty colours   4 for the pan   my deadly weapon and a victim"
