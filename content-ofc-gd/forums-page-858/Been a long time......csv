I figure it has been something like 24 years since I have been Trout fishing....and almost as long (at least it feels that way!) since I posted a fishing report! LOL  The last couple of years have been real busy while we tried to settle into this place, and I just haven't been able to get out fishing like I always have in the past. Since we bought our trailer back in 1986, I was always busy trying to get that place opened up in the spring and the boat ready, etc. Trout fishing just took a back seat to everything else.  Forward to today, and we live right on a tributary of the Nottawasaga river. I had seen the little Speckled Trout quite a few times over the last two years, but never had a chance to throw a line at them. We pulled a couple of spunky Creek Chub out last summer, but otherwise nothing else.  This morning, I woke up a little after 6 am, made a pot of coffee and set about getting a rod rigged up and hunted for about 20 minutes trying to find my waders!  I headed down to the small bridge behind the house and rigged a float, several tiny split shot, and a #12 hook decorated with a Berkley Pink Trout worm. After only a couple of casts (man was I rusty!), the Chub started hitting straight away. All in all, I figure I easily landed about 15 or 20 of them.  Got down to a bend in the small creek and Wow! This little Speckie came out to greet me!   Fished along the creek till I came to a nice sized pool. Nothing but more Creek chub though. This little guy was typical.   Started heading towards home and managed another small trout. Tossed a new worm in alongside a log and WHAM! This guy came thrashing onto the bank!   Another shot of the same fish!   All in all, it felt great and I had a lot of fun! Hope anyone else that got out this morning had a good day? I know these are nothing like all them chrome Steelhead everyone likes to catch, but pecking away at tiny streams for natural resident Trout was always my preference."
334659,Beats,2009-04-25 17:51:00,543,Great report.  Nice brook trout.  I'd take a small creek with brook trout over shoulder to shoulder fishing any day.
334662,Joeytier,2009-04-25 17:56:00,3990,Beautiful trout!  Thanks for sharing.
334668,ben306,2009-04-25 18:07:00,59,"Very nice fish.  So these plastic worms, do they catch alot then? You'd never catch a thing on anything like that fishing in the UK so this is all new to me and the techniques/baits you use"
334671,Rattletrap2,2009-04-25 18:25:00,1652,"Thanks Folks!  Yes ben306, a Student of mine was telling me that these are all he uses for SteelHead and other trout fishing. I can't believe how great they actually worked! I had good success on using bright pink ""Bubblegum"" coloured senko baits on Bass as well. They look like NOTHING that actually swims in these waters! I tried a few casts with natural coloured worms, but no comparison to these."
334673,solopaddler,2009-04-25 18:26:00,8605,"You're a very lucky man to have that right in your backyard! Nice little spec, well done."
334678,ben306,2009-04-25 18:33:00,59," Thanks for that, think Ill have to have a go of these once I arrive!"
334722,Leecher,2009-04-25 21:17:00,7832,Great report and pics Rattletrap  Congratulations on those beauties and thanks for sharing Leechman
334735,Roy,2009-04-25 22:17:00,13728,WTG Brian. Really glad to see you get out and have a good time! Thanks for posting.
334876,Spiel,2009-04-26 10:36:00,9065,Brian out trout fishing. I think I'm going to wait for the alarm to wake me up cause I must be dreaming.
334890,b2kptbo,2009-04-26 11:24:00,1505,"Pretty good for a walk from the backyard, WTG..."
334913,Greencoachdog,2009-04-26 12:50:00,8163,Great report and pics RT2!!!  That Brookie looks like a very respectable fish for the water you described!!!  The Chub looks like good Pike/Bass bait!
335054,Rattletrap2,2009-04-26 19:32:00,1652,Thanks GCD! Yes it is a very small stream and difficult to fish because of all the trees and brush in the water.
335059,irishfield,2009-04-26 19:39:00,26272,Great stuff Brian... old school on a nice little spinning rod ! Can't beat that...
335200,ehg,2009-04-27 01:18:00,2666,"Wow, that's pretty nice for right in your backyard. That last brookie looks to be a decent size."
335204,douG,2009-04-27 01:23:00,2693,"Fine speck, Brian.  Thanks for the nice pictures.  Ben, I wonder what might happen if you started throwing some Ontario stuff at the fish at home?"
