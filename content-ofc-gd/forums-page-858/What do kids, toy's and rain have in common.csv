Poor boat still needs to get wet.  Rather than spend the time in the city I decided to head down to Port Maitland and start getting ready for the summer months.    We arrived late Saturday so really only enough time to get the trailer in her spot and hook up the gas before the storm hit.  Possibility of light rain my %$%&&$%^%$&*T&  What do you get when you put rain, kids and toys together..     After we played around cleaning up after the winter, off too the Dunnville pier for a hour while our little guy headed home for a bath   .  Lots of fish biting too keep Olivia happy and she got this nice silver Bass.   Her old man got big tasty sheepshead. Yummy  Olivia lost a big something and I picked up a nice tree fish.  note too all the Port Maitland docks are not in yet"
