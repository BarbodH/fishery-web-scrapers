969354,manitoubass2,2016-05-12 19:15:00,11391,Cust curious...  If so I would have a few questions for you.
969356,netminder,2016-05-12 19:31:00,514,"civil engineer, soooo kinda but not really lol. Always interested to field engineering questions though."
969357,Terry,2016-05-12 19:52:00,14456,no but I stayed at a Holiday Inn
969358,cheaptackle,2016-05-12 19:56:00,849,Rod Caster is in that field - not sure what exact area but if he don't know he probably knows someone who does.  Michael
969360,jimmer,2016-05-12 20:18:00,2730,"What's the question? I would love to see some of the answers from our fellow OFCers. We have all the answers, didn't you know. LOL  Of course you knew!"
969362,Rod Caster,2016-05-12 20:23:00,5784,Environmental engineering tech and Certified Engineering Technologist here. Definitely not an engineer though.  Legally I can't say I'm an engineer and I have to correct people if they call me one. Otherwise the PEO will track me down and give me a cease and desist order haha
969364,Sinker,2016-05-12 20:27:00,8692,Environmental Technologist. I wouldn't even want to be an engineer. Those guys screw everything up.  S.
969376,manitoubass2,2016-05-12 22:14:00,11391,"Hahahah.  Well here is the deal.  Im currently working at new gold mine.  The company has decided to offer me a position with one of their enviromental engineers. Already know the guy and worked with him on another project unrelated, great guy great boss.  Anyhow, this means a pretty good pay raise, new truck including fuel card, and a desk in the tbay office.  Downside is i would be travelling(not far) but my boundries would basically be north to ear falls, as far as thunder bay, and also in the dryden area.  Im very tempted(fishing possibilies) also from what my ""future"" boss tells me its a cakewalk. Lotsa work at home on a laptop just running numbers. Not a tonne of travel but some( a week here a week there kinda thing)  He says his area is mainly scouting and accessing areas for wildlife native to the area, as well as insects/plants/trees etc."
969377,manitoubass2,2016-05-12 22:16:00,11391,"He is an enviromental engineer but from what hes told me, its sounds like hes actually doing work outside of engineering.  I would think off the top of my head, dam construction, bridges etc"
969378,Rod Caster,2016-05-12 22:19:00,5784,"Sounds like a good gig, and a terrific field to get into for your area (mines and the like)  That kind of work is more ecology/biology vs engineering but the lines blur very easily in the environmental field. I do almost as much civil work as I do enviro  Good luck Rick. More pay and perks are a great start!"
969379,manitoubass2,2016-05-12 22:33:00,11391,"So you think its an upgrade?  Remember I have no schooling on this so I know I gonna be a female dog, but its sound to me like a great upgrade"
969390,John Bacon,2016-05-13 00:09:00,3277,"So you think its an upgrade?  Remember I have no schooling on this so I know I gonna be a female dog, but its sound to me like a great upgrade  Well, I know what one pretty famous person would say...  ""If someone offers you an amazing opportunity and you're not sure you can do it, say yes - then learn how to do it later."" - Richard Branson"
969391,FloatnFly,2016-05-13 00:10:00,1640,"i would say anything where you the possibility to learn something new, and with those kind of perks, take it.  you never know when those opprotunities will come up again.  the more you know how to do, the better you set yourself up for the future."
969409,manitoubass2,2016-05-13 05:48:00,11391,Well a 2.5 hour convo answered most of my questions.  Looks like im moving job titles very soon  Ill call myself a enviromental hooker from here on out lol.
969411,Joeytier,2016-05-13 07:20:00,3990,"If they're already aware of your backgroubd, and are offering the title anyways, you have nothing to worry about."
969417,Acountdeleted,2016-05-13 10:43:00,2562,Go fish at Bluffy lake in Ear Falls. Become friends with Keith who owns the lodge on the lake.
969428,Rod Caster,2016-05-13 12:42:00,5784,Rick is a tree hugger now!!! Where's your bowl of granola
969430,chris.brock,2016-05-13 13:12:00,4053,"That sounds about right, doing environmental assessment but being paid by the mining company, it's like a constant conflict of interest.  Regardless, call me a tree hugger too because that sounds like a sweet gig"
969450,KLINKER,2016-05-13 15:37:00,256,"I'm a farmer, that's the same thing as an environmental engineer, take the job."
969456,manitoubass2,2016-05-13 16:56:00,11391,Hahahahaha.  Same with Chad???  Granolas on the top shelf! Amazing with some yogurt lol
969457,DRIFTER_016,2016-05-13 16:58:00,10439,Hahahahaha.  Same with Chad  Granolas on the top shelf! Amazing with some yogurt lol  Next you'll be going out to buy some Birkinstocks and Khakis!!!!
969458,manitoubass2,2016-05-13 17:02:00,11391,"And chris we are contracted to work at the mine. I dont work directly for them.  Currently im just running the trimble equipment, measuring out digging sites and on the side doing some compaction testing"
969459,manitoubass2,2016-05-13 17:03:00,11391,Hahahah. Cargo pants/shorts for life!!!  And sweat pants at home lol
