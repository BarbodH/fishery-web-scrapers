969593,16 Footer,2016-05-14 14:08:00,191,"The campground at the NW corner is gone, housing going in, no launch there any more. The only launch left is on Blue Bird road on the south side, take airport road to get there. The Blue Bird launch is not as good as the old closed launch on the west side by the factory."
