969238,captpierre,2016-05-11 11:48:00,2521,Got to do some chain saw work this weekend. Bought fresh premium gas. My Stihl oil that came with the saw  in small containers is 3-4 yrs old. Is there a shelf life on this stuff?

969280,Big Cliff,2016-05-11 22:08:00,6899,No problem at all!
969283,irishfield,2016-05-11 23:11:00,26272,"Stihl oil even has stabilizer already in it.. so it shouldn't go bad. Have never had an issue with it, even mixed and sitting for a couple of years running it in my saws."
