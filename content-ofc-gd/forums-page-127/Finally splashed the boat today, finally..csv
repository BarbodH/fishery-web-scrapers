968491,Old Ironmaker,2016-05-04 05:16:00,8243,"The boats been ready for 2 weeks and finally hit the Grand today for a boat test and try our luck on some Big Cats. A 2 day 8 fish total catch and release Derby was held at Fishmasters Marina Dunnville on the weekend. 111 pounds took the moula, I mean trophy. Not bad at all. So off we went on this gorgeous day. Splashed the boat and she won't start. Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, no, no, no and no. After what felt like forever and playing with everything it went vroom. Get on the river warmed her up running 2500 RPM for a bit and hit the pedal to the metal. At 4000 RPM she stalled. Started OK but would stall out everytime it got past 3500 RPM. Man that sucks. If it was the lake I would have trailered it but the river is a bit different. After waiting since November no way we were going in. no way. So 7 MPH it was for the day. Hit the usual holes but not much luck until the wind switched from NE to SW around noon. Just as predicted by Windfinder.com. It is an accurate wind and weather forecast. They are usually bang on and were today. At 4PM my tummy was calling and decided to make the 1/2 hour run a mile up river.  As for the fish, no Big Cats on this fine day. We marked small fish tight to bottom at all the usual hunting spots but no big arcs all day. We had some fun catching a dozen or so Yellow Bullhead. They sure are pretty. A bad day fishing is better than doing anything with the lights on. That is actually an oxymoron, ""a bad day fishing"" really doesn't exist unless someone pokes an eye out.  As for the ""Bassassin"" it's a fuel problem, probably the 9 dollar fuel bulb I just changed. I told my wife I saw a brand spanking new 115 Evinrude E Tec in the marina showroom this week, great price too I think. 10 grand. She gave me 10 bucks and told me to keep the change. I haven't priced new engines in years. 10 grand sounds fair to me, I really don't know. I think it's a 2015.  Sorry, no fish porn."

968510,Smokercrafty,2016-05-04 14:17:00,227,"ive always loved how you can buy a boat for peanuts, but if you want the motor to drive said boat you need a mortgage Definitely hit the nail on the head with that comment! Frustrating at times! Time to switch careers and become a marine mechanic! Never a problem again!."
968512,Consigliere,2016-05-04 14:40:00,121,if it's not your fuel bulb probably a high speed jet plugged on the carb.
968532,Old Ironmaker,2016-05-04 19:35:00,8243,"Looked at it for a bit today. I am going to change the fuel filter and invest the 9 bucks and change the brand new bulb. Over 100 years of combustion engine technology and we have to squeeze a bulb to start an engine!!?? I'm no mechanic but I think that's ludicrous. But I guess it's the most efficient way to prime a 2 stroke engine, and cheapest. I should service the carbs regardless.  BOAT= Bring out another thou.  No picture it never happened it seems to be. I did sign up with Photo Bucket at least, it's a start."

968535,Old Ironmaker,2016-05-04 19:58:00,8243,Believe it or not AKRISONER there isn't anyone that sells a can of Seafoam in the entire county. Not only that I need to drive to Hamilton to get Shell ethanol free fuel.  Country living at it's best. Cheap eggs and Billion dollar views of Lake Erie though.
968542,kickingfrog,2016-05-04 21:12:00,8333,Good to hear. I hope to get out on Friday for my first trip. P.A. day perchin' with my son.
968543,G.mech,2016-05-04 21:22:00,830,"Not only that I need to drive to Hamilton to get Shell ethanol free fuel.    All the Esso fuel (including regular) that comes out of the Nanticoke refinery is ethanol free.  Double check at your local station but Davis Fuels supplies a few of the independent stations out my way from Esso and they assure me that this is the case.  They told me that Nanticoke does not currently even have the capability to add ethanol.  Also, you may notice that many of the trucks lined up at the distribution terminal down there are Petro-Can and Pioneer as they all share fuel in the more remote areas to save on transportation.  If you can confirm that the gas comes from Nanticoke, you will know it's ethanol free regardless of whose name is on the pump."

968554,Old Ironmaker,2016-05-04 22:42:00,8243,"Thanks G. Mech I need to ask around about the fuel.  Brian, you crazy mon."
968560,Rizzo,2016-05-04 23:37:00,4754,glad you got out and hope you get er all fixed up. My boat still sits patiently waiting
968578,wormdunker,2016-05-05 02:16:00,1711,At least you didn't report a dead battery!  LOL!  You must have read the instructions I gave you about charging batteries BEFORE heading out fishing!
968594,Mister G,2016-05-05 10:01:00,1429,"10k for a brand new 115hp E-TEC is a GREAT price.....  Not sure what you have now on the back of the boat, but if you do buy that 115 E-TEC you don't have to worry about buying ethanol free gas because that motor is set up for it.  I have a 2015 90 hp HO E-TEC which is a 115 hp de-tuned down to 99 hp and LOVE IT ! ! !  She purrs like a kitten when started and never pumped the bulb to start it, not even sure if it has one.  I have trolled down to 2.2 mph last season for walleye and again for early steelhead and browns this years for HOURS without a hic up....gas mileage is excellent.....GET if if you can.......I purchased mine last March and it came with a 7 year warranty.....now that's hard to beat and the self winterizing is a dream come true."

For SeaFoam  Simcoe CTC has 57 cans Delhi CTC has 27 cans @ $12.49 + Tax  Normandale Hidden Valley Camp ground. At my trailer I can bring you as many cans as you want @ $10.00 Tax included. Also included in this offer is a cold beverage of your of your liking; as long as I have it in my bar. Which could turn into a free meal and a nights stay, if you've had one to many of the adult beverages.  As for the power loss at high RPM; does the boat have an in-board fuel tank? If an in-board tank and the filter and bulb does not fix this; you my want to check if the sock filter/screen in the tank on the fuel pick-up tube is not partly clogged?  Dan."
968619,AKRISONER,2016-05-05 13:30:00,5558,"http://www.pure-gas.org/index.jsp?stateprov=ON  a list of all ethanol free gas stations in Ontario. Im lucky i have a shell in Pointe Au Baril  cliff notes:  All Canada: Shell V-Power, Esso premium, MacEwen premium   hopefully one near you!"
968621,Mister G,2016-05-05 14:13:00,1429,Instead of a corn stand in front of your house you should set up a Seafoam stand along with lemon aid....
969299,Old Ironmaker,2016-05-12 04:00:00,8243,"Thanks for all the words of encouragement. I did find some Sea Foam in Caledonia CTC Dan, thanks. The boat sits in line at Proctors awaiting a diagnosis. At least I got a free Fishfull Thinking hat from Charlie Wray who was there to service his tinny, what a boat!!. A good guy."
