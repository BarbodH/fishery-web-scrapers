969529,Ron,2016-05-14 01:02:00,1683,Wouldn't make a difference with his roe bags nootch. They still won't catch fish..... LOL  Is there anything else other than bucktails that catch walleye? make sure you got lots of color choices too. Any color is perfect so long as the hair is black.
969652,Garnet,2016-05-14 21:59:00,2056,Only left over March roe bags. I know what mine eat to day. Same every year.
969654,206,2016-05-14 22:24:00,563,"Didn't wanna fight winds or rain so we launched on Rice just before midnight. Water was slight ripple. It took an hour and a half to locate fish. Home, fish cleaned and in bed by 5am. back in for night shift tonight so it worked out well."

Home, fish cleaned and in bed by 5am. back in for night shift tonight so it worked out well.  I have yet to grow the nads needed to launch my boat at night."
969712,Garnet,2016-05-15 10:42:00,2056,We started at 8am. took a bit to find fish. The rain was cold and the fish really wanted to bite. They either gulped or just there. So OK morning. Got a little nauticasl in the afternoon. Bewdly Pizza made it thru the winter without me.
969799,captpierre,2016-05-16 00:02:00,2521,Too weanie to go out. Saw a few brave souls. Terrific winds and some flurries today. I'll gettum next week.
969818,ehg,2016-05-16 03:03:00,2666,Back in the day would troll the back channel (east side Boyd Island) weedline 10-15 ft. at opener with orange Benos and black/gold Rapalas. Find the back channel weedline  and slowly troll with baits mentioned or similar. Good luck!
969292,captpierre,2016-05-12 02:41:00,2521,Will suck. Cold. Wet. Windy ?
969295,irishfield,2016-05-12 03:09:00,26272,"Sounds like perfect conditions, Walleye chop and all !"
969296,Dan668,2016-05-12 03:13:00,1120,"Yep,  unfortunate,  may call off my plans for Sunday."
969297,Joeytier,2016-05-12 03:21:00,3990,"Boo-hoo, that's why rain suits and long jons exist!  We're looking at subzero nights and rain both days, and I'll be tent-camping fishing for brookies and loving every minute of it (y)  Bring some friends and make a good time out of the bad weather"
969298,Dan668,2016-05-12 03:31:00,1120,"Rain doesn't bother me,  just getting the boat back on the trailer lol. Boat is like a kite. I'll just have to find a more protected launch"
969307,fishindevil,2016-05-12 11:22:00,6254,"bring it on im ready as always !!!!! yup gonna be windy rainy and major drop in temps and pressure.....walleye chop for sure.....even wet snow a possibility....in the kawarthas,but it sure wont be the weather we are enjoying this week.....I have a deep V lund so wont bother me too much"
969312,Sinker,2016-05-12 12:39:00,8692,I have to work anyways. Think I will wait until during the week to get my fill.  S.
969313,Garnet,2016-05-12 12:52:00,2056,Early sat the wind is going to change direction every hour so that won't be bad.
969315,manjo39,2016-05-12 13:12:00,354,"Wet and windy is okay, but cold front not good for the bite and near zero not good for feeling the finger tips.  As Joeytier says above, always a good time."
969319,Dan668,2016-05-12 14:02:00,1120,"I also have a lund deep v,  so well see. Few years ago i was on rice when it was windy,  launch was unprotected and away from dock,  it was a nightmare getting the boat back on the trailer. Looks like a strong west wind sunday,  so same conditions."
969337,porkpie,2016-05-12 16:09:00,2521,"Opener.... Yikes!  Shorten your life expectancy, take a job working shifts and never fish a weekend again!"
969340,tb4me,2016-05-12 17:00:00,3295,"ill be on the Trent river.. we changed our date from leaving tom night to leaving tonight..We have a TON of leaves to get cleaned up.. Was going to do leaves sat and fish sun..Now were going to do leaves tomorrow and fish sat am...Should be interesting..Planing to fish the mouth of the river at the bottom of a sanctuary...Fishing for walleye doesn't open where my actual dock is for another week..I had a neighbor tell me that i cant even use my dock if I have fishing rods in my boat. I know better. but I thought id better ask the masses here before I tell him to stuff it..No lines wet just simply docking in a sanctuary, is this ok?"
969343,Sinker,2016-05-12 17:16:00,8692,Of course it is fine....  S.
969348,Joeytier,2016-05-12 18:38:00,3990,That's me  Tough when all your buddies are 9-5'ers though
969359,jimmer,2016-05-12 20:14:00,2730,Bring on the wind!
969361,esoxansteel,2016-05-12 20:18:00,1307,"You waited 6 months for this, and its not quite here and were complaining yikes"
969365,Sinker,2016-05-12 20:28:00,8692,You won't hear me complain.   S.
969370,Big Cliff,2016-05-12 21:21:00,6899,Cold front and walleye bite = a bit of a challange but I have seen us breaking ice on opening weekend and still catching our limits. I'd rather be fishing than sitting at home wishing I was fishing!
969371,DaveRoach,2016-05-12 21:51:00,202,Any tips on fishing cold front? I guess I'll look for protected warm waters
969382,porkpie,2016-05-12 22:50:00,2521,"Fish slow, use real meat.  Pickerel fishing isn't rocket science, but they can be finicky, and that's why I like fishing them!"
969384,Dan668,2016-05-12 23:01:00,1120,"I fish for them until bass opens,  i dont even keep em. Ive had success with grubs,  lipless cranks and jerkbaits"
969393,Sinker,2016-05-13 00:23:00,8692,Slow. That is all.....and yeah...use some meat.  Did i say slow?  S.
969413,wormdunker,2016-05-13 09:34:00,1711,"I'm trolling at 1.5 mph using a small ""go getter"" with a chunk of dew worm about 1"" long.  My favorite colors are perch & chartreuse.  Hang on with both hands!"
969416,Garnet,2016-05-13 10:24:00,2056,Feed them bucktails.
969522,esoxansteel,2016-05-14 00:11:00,1307,"Feed them bucktails.     I like your thinking Garnet, no need to rip, fish them real slooooow, and even let them sit motionless briefly if need be, Garnet are you still tipping your jigs with left over roe bags"
