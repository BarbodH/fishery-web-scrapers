969406,ccmtcanada,2016-05-13 03:24:00,7971,Awesome memories from Lakair for the two get togethers I attended.  My first ever Muskie....meeting lots of board members....lots of laughs!!
969412,Rich Clemens,2016-05-13 09:29:00,3131,Yup.   Meet a lot of great friends at the GTG. Many I still stay in thought with and meet up each year.

969485,Dutch01,2016-05-13 20:13:00,1431,"I was at Lakair for the GTG's back in 2003 and 2004 I believe it was. Those were great times at a great place. We had a magical hour at Devils Elbow, a walleye just about every cast for almost an hour. There were lots of pike caught too, we had quite the fry.  Those were fun times, sad to see the way things turned out, but good luck to the new owners."

969512,misfish,2016-05-13 23:12:00,29133,Maybe a good helping of red beans and rice will help absorb it Art. That was one of my high lights of the pot luck. Dang those southern boys know how to cook up a good mess of that. Went well with that jerk chicken I introduced you to.  I know Joe enjoyed that leg . Never knew that there was an oyster piece in a chicken leg before. Always think of you byes when I fork that piece out.

LOL They're not an issue but there are a lot of them; between the roof line and the covered porch. The only time we'd notice them during daylight times, was when we were having a BBQ; they don't like the smoke. Some how one got into the cabin, didn't realize it until the middle of the night, when I felt something crawling up my chest.

969171,wvmedic,2016-05-10 15:08:00,144,"Anyone know the status of Lakair since the new owners have taken over?  I'm looking for a place on the West Arm that has tent camping as an option.  Anyone know of a good place besides the old Lakair?  Thanks, Jeff"
969175,Rich Clemens,2016-05-10 16:59:00,3131,"The last I had heard, the new owners were doing a lot of remodeling.  Looks like they were completely rebuilding the one cabin that sits down there by the launch.  It was my understanding that the new owner would be doing seasonal rentals only(What I recall hearing anyway).    Some of OFC'ers are booking now up on the West Arm at Mashkinonje for the Musky opener since Lakair closed.   I'm going to hit Memquisit for a week this September and give that a try.    A number of us are already booked for the opener this year at Mashkinonje."
969177,wvmedic,2016-05-10 17:22:00,144,"Thanks Rich,  The Wife and I were up on the French and Nipissing this past June/July before she was diagnosed with cancer. We spent our 32nd wedding anniversary there fishing. One day while on the lake, I decided to make a run by Lakair. They were remodeling at the time, I spoke with the owner's Brother. He said that they planned on opening this season, he didn't mention anything about seasonal rentals only. I didn't get any contact information as he told me that the plan was to use the current Lakair web site.  With the seasonal rentals, are you referring to the campground only or the cabins also?  I want to make the trip with my Son and his Family, hopefully my Wife as well. Though I will be footing the bill, so camping is a huge incentive.  Though if I were to go back and stay in a lodge, Memquisit would be it. We docked our boat there for a few days while we were there. Great folks and would stay there without hesitation.  Jeff"
969193,woodenboater,2016-05-10 21:47:00,2277,"I hope they keep casual campers in mind and not just seasonal (if that's re: tents and trailers). I know Leslie and Kevin were looking at ditching seasonal trailers and there was only the one left by the showers.  I hope they reopen soon, I'd like to drive by and see what changes have been undertaken. I liked the mix of cabins, trailers and tenters."
969196,Mister G,2016-05-10 22:12:00,1429,I personally prefer  Memquisit
969199,aplumma,2016-05-10 22:46:00,6896,At this time with the demise of Kevin Lake Air was sold and the units went under rehab. The units are seasonal rentals and the camping has been discontinued. The personal house that Leslie and  Kevin lived in still remains with the family.   Art
969201,wvmedic,2016-05-10 22:53:00,144,"Thank you Art, it saddens me to see that happen. I have found childhood memories there going back to the 70's"
969204,Rich Clemens,2016-05-10 23:29:00,3131,"Thanks for confirming Art.  Basically what I remember from being  up that way last year.  Lew actually stopped by and was talking to the folks there - which is where I got my info.  Lot's of great times there at Lakair.   First time I ever went camping was at Lakair.   I've heard lots of good things about Memquisit, so we're gonna give it go for some fall musky action .....  We hope anyway."
969227,Old Ironmaker,2016-05-11 04:19:00,8243,"Jeff, O am saddened to hear of your wife's health problem. A thing no one should have to endure. Cancer free here for 5 years and counting.  I have not been to Memquisit but I can't see any lodge that way being any nicer to stay at than Maskinonje. Regan and Goldie are fantastic hosts and you can't find a cleaner place anywhere. Italo Labignon chose to stay their and shoot an episode, that says a lot. If not for Goldie I would have sunk my boat even the 4 year old helped. I hope they have remedied the launch though. Where ever you choose to go don't forget to put in the plug. Put in the plug, put in the plug, don't forget the plug."
969228,manitoubass2,2016-05-11 04:38:00,11391,I have no knowledge of these lakes/camps but like OI said put in your plugs lol.  The time my buddy forgot it almost cost us our lives

Even my son that doesn't really like to camp enjoyed going there and just the other day asked me about the place.  I met and made a lot of friends going there, it will be missed"
969243,wvmedic,2016-05-11 12:21:00,144,"Hey, Whopper thank you Sir for the positive thoughts.  Yes the Lakair deal is a bummer, I love that place. In the years I have been going, I have stayed in the cabins when I was a kid. As an adult, I have camped there. I have had better success elsewhere, though the west arm of Nipissing is more about nostalgia for me. Also the convenience of close proximity of stores, hydro and hot showers.  Not sure that the Wife or the Grandson's would like the amenities in the bush. My Wife is a tough Woman, though she has some anxiety about being so far out in the bush where I have been going in Québec. The Grandson's are young, 9 and 10 so I'm not sure how they would do in the bush.  Jeff"

969275,Old Ironmaker,2016-05-11 21:36:00,8243,"Only one way to find out, get them out there. Roughing it isn't something you learn late in life or in school. Once they have been to Disney World and a few 3 star resorts even, camping is something they might not catch onto. I was 23 the first time I slept in a tent, too late for me to learn to care to enjoy it."
969281,wvmedic,2016-05-11 22:51:00,144,"Old Ironmaker, I agree and I have thought about it. Might have to get them in a tent a couple times near home and see how they do.  Jeff"
