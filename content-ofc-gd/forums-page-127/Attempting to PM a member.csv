969513,Old Ironmaker,2016-05-13 23:19:00,8243,"What browser are you using Wormdunker. I had the same problems sometime back and now again, that's why I asked you to use email rather than PM. I switched to Google Chrome by suggestion of Art then switched back when I got Windows 10 as Chrome caused me bigger problems. Now all of my options here on OFC like Bold, font etc. doesn't work. I love computers, don't you?"

969567,Old Ironmaker,2016-05-14 06:17:00,8243,I think Wormdunker is using Windows 95.
969568,wormdunker,2016-05-14 07:57:00,1711,"Nope using windows 8 since I purchased new lap top last June.  I have read too many reports about windows 10 to attempt it.  I'm afraid to try it.  Just like my phone - I've had 3 iphones, I refuse to try another brand - took me a long time to learn iphones!  LOL!"

969573,wormdunker,2016-05-14 11:24:00,1711,I sent a PM this morning & everything worked properly.

969657,Old Ironmaker,2016-05-14 22:47:00,8243,I liked 8 better. It had issues but don't they all do? My brother has a Mac and he doesn't think it's worth the extra bucks. What ever happened to poor Windows 9? You PC nuts know the answer.

I'm not sure if you followed any of the other threads on Win10 but microsoft is forcing the upgrades on many user of 7 and 8. I suggest running a utility called never10 to block the upgrade.

969665,Old Ironmaker,2016-05-15 00:19:00,8243,"My phone is easy. I type in the number that I want to talk to and they say ""Hello"". That's how I use it. The old fashioned way. My wife can talk into it and a text message is typed out. I just call the person. Does this phone of mine do other stuff I don't need to know like tell me I'm lost, again? Now if could cut the grass I might do more with it."
