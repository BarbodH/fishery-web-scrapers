Harvesting of snapping turtles and bullfrogs, and only those species, is allowed in that Wildlife Management Area, but only from July 15 to September 15."
969863,cram,2016-05-16 15:56:00,1733,Yikes.  Can't say I've ever had a craving for snapping turtle.
969899,Rizzo,2016-05-16 18:15:00,4754,gross. they stink
969900,Rizzo,2016-05-16 18:15:00,4754,...I meant the turtles but I suppose it could apply to the poachers as well
969910,manitoubass2,2016-05-16 19:12:00,11391,Friggen poachers?  I ate snapping turtle once. Tastes good but takes about a hundred years to chew.  Def. Not on my list of things I want to eat again
969913,pics,2016-05-16 19:19:00,1268,Poachers are everywhere but until there is a real effort to stop them it will only get worse... weeks before the season starts guys line the dam in Caledonia targeting and catching out of season fish but no one stops them.. Good luck calling the authorities.. no one responds..
969914,manitoubass2,2016-05-16 19:22:00,11391,The government loves money grabs.  I wish a course was offered to anglers that allowed them to write legally binding tickets.
969926,bigugli,2016-05-16 20:04:00,6138,Down here the big market is for those cute little painted turtles the pet stores always have.
969927,dave524,2016-05-16 20:25:00,4508,"When I lived in Port Rowan I had snapping turtle soup/stew with veggies and barley, it was tasty. Locals said there is 7 kinds of meat on a turtle. Don't know of Painted Turtles being marketed illegally as pets but I know there is a problem with persons releasing alien Red Eared Sliders into the wild ."

For 3 years, there was a group of people trapping painted turtles at Charles Daley. I would call the MNR every spring, then they stopped showing up. I would like to believe they finally got caught."

I would like to believe they finally got caught.  I confess,  back in the 50's as a kid, I kept a Painted in a galvanized laundry tub and fed it earthworms , lettuce and raw hamburger all summer letting it go back in a pond Labour Day weekend."
969992,manitoubass2,2016-05-17 04:49:00,11391, My son found a pretty big painter turtle on a dirt road near the river. He ran over and picked it up.  It pissed all over him.  My confession is I laughed hysterically at my own son
