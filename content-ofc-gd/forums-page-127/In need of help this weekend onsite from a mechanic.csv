969931,Big Cliff,2016-05-16 20:39:00,6899,"So Vince warned me that the one caliper was very bad and he did his best to save it.  While driving my kids home (one way is 65KM) I could feel it binding from time to time.  On my way home it was getting worse (to me as the driver).  Message over to Ernie knowing he had a new RR caliper at home, he said ""come over"".  Got there, presto change-o and my drive from his place home was MUCH better.  It wasn't fully pooched just yet Vince as what you did gave it a bit more life but as someone who no longer likes to drive and has anxiety issues in general I needed it replaced.  It wasn't seized yet as Ernie could still move it but it was getting there.  So a HUGE shout out to Ernie for changing his plans, doing the work and hooking me up with the part!  Talk about GREAT PEOPLE HERE!!  Now to go get his a replacement caliper and a little somethin' somethin' for that! Takes a pretty special person to change their fishing plans to help someone out! Good on you Ernie!!"
969933,fishnsled,2016-05-16 20:44:00,3520,"Some great people of this board, but we already know that.   Glad you got it sorted out Geoff and hats of to all your helpers."
969247,GBW,2016-05-11 13:56:00,8460,"*Truck Update* So I get the truck (after the CRAP morning I was having-yesterday) to a local shop before I heading to work at 1PM for them to replace the front left caliper on such short notice. I asked them to do an oil change while it was in and check the other breaking systems too. Well wouldn't you know it but the truck needs three done (the front left was the least of my worries it turns out). Only 3 needed as E! did the last fouled up one so it's golden. The person I used ""in a pinch"" to do the pads and rotors never put the lubricant provided in the boxes on when he did the breaks so they are burning up and making a TON of noise too! So now the truck is OFF the road AGAIN till I get it fixed! This is really NOT GOOD considering I have my kids this weekend and cannot get them or take them home till the truck is safe to drive. Off Thurs and working Fri so who knows what I can do other then hope like hell the parts I just ordered online come in on Thurs for me to get the front end resolved and wait on another part for the RR. This month can please go away and end now, it's killing me in every sense of the way... Can really use a hand here to do this work folks as it's got to be done at my house on the driveway and my trusty mechanic has prior plans and cannot make it."
969269,huzzsaba,2016-05-11 20:28:00,884,"when you say burning up, are they heating up or just squealing?  what kind of truck is it?"

969278,Big Cliff,2016-05-11 22:04:00,6899,I wish I could help but I'm not that kind of mechanic.

969301,GBW,2016-05-12 06:15:00,8460,"when you say burning up, are they heating up or just squealing?  what kind of truck is it? there is zero lube so when in motion the sounds are like a stuck pig...  2007 Ram 1500"

969341,GBW,2016-05-12 17:03:00,8460,"The calipers came in for the front, waiting on the rear.  Anyone able to help and as stated above when the new pads were put on they were never lubed so if you can help please bring some lubricant for them too as I cannot drive it to go get some or drive it to a shop to be fixed as they are that bad and unsafe to drive...  PM ME PLEASE if you can help! *edit to add* oh and a bit of break fluid too!  I will give you cash for the items and time to help!"
969342,Tom McCutcheon,2016-05-12 17:14:00,627,"I can not help with the mechanical repair portion of this dilemma, but if you want to go for a ride and pick up the necessary parts (or anything else you need at the moment), I can certainly arrange that.

(waiting on the RR to come in still) As for your offer, you are one great and kind person my friend!  My EX finally said yes she will drop my kids off here tomorrow evening.  I just need to figure out Sun.  I have to have them home for 4PM Sun and my folks are now back in Canada so they I think will come by and see my kids (been 8 weeks since they seen them) and offered to help in a pinch.
