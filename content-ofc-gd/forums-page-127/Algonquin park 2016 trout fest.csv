Friday morning we were ready to push off the shore of Cedar lake at Brent and paddle across to the Petawawa River to start our first portage.   One of the portages up the Petawawa is Unicorn hill and has a reputation for being a killer, Got to admit it lived up to it at 2.4km long and uphill. Of course we had to do it twice with the amount of gear we had. But after the climb and 7.2km of Unicorn hill we felt great to be done with the toughest part of our trip.   Set up at camp  "
969720,muskymatt,2016-05-15 13:44:00,2608,"And the fish start to flow!!!   Brookies and Lakers were biting awesome. Had a full on blizzard on the Sunday afternoon but kept fishing all the same.   Nice to get back in the quiet of the Park, not a soul around the entire time. Paddled out the Nipissing and back to Cedar May have to do a fall trip. "
969721,Broker,2016-05-15 14:06:00,482,Super jealous. Was supposed to be in Algonquin in late April but the delay killed that. Ended up in Kawartha HIghlands instead.  Nice fish you got.
969722,Rod Caster,2016-05-15 14:07:00,5784,"awesome! Even with the weather against you, the fish were in spring mode. â€‹Quite the trip. Haven't been up the Pet in years."
969732,Tomcat,2016-05-15 15:10:00,395,Nice report and pics Matt. Nice round trip excursion. Thanks for sharing.

969749,Oggie,2016-05-15 18:17:00,588,That's a nice trip!  Can't say I'm a fan of Ced ar Lake after being storm-stayed for 2 days on it a few years back.
969751,woodenboater,2016-05-15 18:42:00,2277,That's a long drive from southern Ont. but those trout make it worth it. I like the west side off Butt. The intimacy of the smaller lakes and rivers is more my style. How were the flies ?
969752,Terry,2016-05-15 18:45:00,14456,looks like a great trip
969755,misfish,2016-05-15 19:04:00,29133,Are those paths wide enough to take a toon through?  Nice report.

969758,muskymatt,2016-05-15 19:16:00,2608,Are those paths wide enough to take a toon through?  Nice report. Not all of them. Lots of trees down across the paths as well. Tough to navigate.
969793,SirCranksalot,2016-05-15 23:40:00,3291,"No prob revealing your spot, MM. Not many of us are about to follow you in there! I won't be for sure even though I have a canoe and all the gear.  You fish make me drool though!"
969831,shimano19,2016-05-16 10:41:00,196,"Awesome report, I'm always wanted to try this. Might have to get some of the guys together! How did you plan the portage? Is there maps and such. Pm me if you could. Thanks"

969897,ehg,2016-05-16 18:11:00,2666,Great report! Beauty fish and no bugs. The Petawawa is a gem on north side of Algonquin. Would always fish from Lake Traverse down... http://ontariofishingcommunity.com/forums/index.php?showtopic=64097&hl=%2Balgonquin+%2Breport
