Not sure what the weatherman was talking about.  We hit a local spot first with nothing to show. The weather was still favorable, so we decided to bee line it to our spot of years past. Turned out to be a good move. Not 5 minutes in and fish was on. A bigg,n that would peel line and bull dog. Saddley, the hook was pulled. Back down and the same thing. Big fish on. After about 10 minutes,get the fish close enough to see and it,s a pig of a laker. It rolled and yup, popped the hook. This fish was easy the biggest we have ever had at the boat. Some choice words were shared.  Noticed the treble was a bit on the small side, so swapped it out to a larger one. Seemed to be the ticket. Only 3 others got off,but 5 were landed.  A couple of wet old byes by 11:30 and called it as the called weather finaly showed up. Great to get the battle back on.                  Thanks bud for another great day out on the Lady.  "

969656,Old Ironmaker,2016-05-14 22:44:00,8243,You guys did great. That spoon sure took a beating. Good move to move up on the hook size. Sometimes it's just enough to drive it deeper into the fish.
