969840,creditmaster,2016-05-16 12:01:00,190,Hey guys. Going to be in the general area of the Trent River in Hastings and was wondering what's in the river  this time of year and what I should use  for them as I have never fished that River or area . I will not have acces to a boat. Just shore fishing spots. Any help would be appreciated Thanks guys Tight lines

969873,tb4me,2016-05-16 16:45:00,3295,Hastings dam. go over the bridge.to the right will be a parking lot..walk down with a heavy drop shot setup and a pail of shiners..The water was running fast on sunday when I was there
969898,davew3,2016-05-16 18:14:00,430,"We used live minnows/worms with egg slip sinkers.  about a 6 ft lead.  also watch the locals, they use imitation minnow flies.   They bomb them out and work them back in the eddies.  And under hwy 30 at the Trent Village bridge.  Also look on the map, look for the other locks and fish the bottom of them as well.  Good luck."
