969728,scuro2,2016-05-15 14:46:00,904,"Wow a government that is okay with Science, who'd a thunk it?"
969729,Steve,2016-05-15 15:05:00,2075,"a change in guard.  great in my mind.  ""the sweater"" didn't really want to hear none of that sciency stuff."
969730,fishermccann,2016-05-15 15:06:00,655,Guess things like that happen if the previous PM is a born again christian. They do not have a good relationship with science.

969737,landry,2016-05-15 16:41:00,1005,One more example of what a disgrace Harper was. Not that I trust Trudeau but this is good to see.
969750,Oggie,2016-05-15 18:20:00,588,Geez policies based on data ...... there's an idea!  Maybe they'll even be allowed to PUBLISH their data and speak on matters of science ..... like in a free country!  I'm not totally OK with Trudeau but this is one of the reasons I couldn't vote for Harper.
969844,Ronzo,2016-05-16 12:43:00,124,This is the kind of stuff that I was crossing my fingers for when Harper finally got the boot...
969954,Dara,2016-05-16 23:22:00,3052,Sounds a lot like he is following in Kathleen's footsteps.  Wait till we get stuck with a big bill for  climate change
969955,BITEME,2016-05-16 23:53:00,1968,This is very good news I willing to pay for the science just not the bureaucracy behind it I just hope fisheries and oceans gets what they need
969963,Paudash,2016-05-17 00:23:00,273,I am sure that this will go well to help the new Ontario Liberal goal to move all Ontario homes to electric Heat by 2040  Just because they hire them does not mean they will support them.   Government will only listen to what they want to hear and when they go against them they will do the same as the last government and let them go.

If I were a betting man I'd say to you bill wise, you ain't seen nothing yet. http://nsidc.org/arcticseaicenews/"

970047,Dara,2016-05-17 18:07:00,3052,Good policies = good governance. Good going Justin.   we haven't seen a policy yet...just heard a bunch of hype  when is he going to push Quebec for the energy east pipeline
970091,Oggie,2016-05-18 00:39:00,588,Never I hope. I have a camp 2km from the natural gas pipeline in Eastern Ontario.  I don't believe for a minute it's simple to switch a 25 year old gas pipeline into a crude oil pipeline.  If they want to pipe oil then install a properly engineered oil pipeline and I'd support that project. I'm willing to live with the risk but I'm not convinced this old pipeline is the answer.

NIMBY...let the engineers worry about that part   what I can't figure out is why so many people are upset with selling the Saudi's them armoured trucks but they are against a pipeline that would let us use our own oil instead of buying it from them and giving them the money to buy the trucks from us...duh
