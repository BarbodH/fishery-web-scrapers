970236,Raycaster,2016-05-18 20:48:00,528,"Its time to replace the old fuel line and bulb as the rubber is way past it prime. (sorry couldn't help myself).  Probably just make a custom one as its for a pontoon and not even close to any 6' or 7' advertised.  I have the old one but anyone just happen to know the size? (3/8"" inside diameter I think but 5/16"" mentioned also) .  I see some connectors have 5/16"" barbs... Time to get the ruler out.  Thx ahead.  "
