969439,Sterling,2016-05-13 14:44:00,477,"I got dragged into TSC in Liskeard the other day and was pleasantly surprised that they're liquidating all their fishing stuff (company-wide).  Everything was at least half off. Good stuff too. The cashier told me all local stores sent their fishing stuff to Liskeard as they could liquidate it faster there.  Blue fox spoons $3, nanofil $15/spool, minnow traps $5, premium hooks $1/bag, powerbait trout dope $3 a jar, etc etc etc.  I walked out of there with a 3ft receipt."
969442,porkpie,2016-05-13 15:08:00,2521,My local TSC was doing that last year.  Got a bunch of good stuff cheap.  They must've sent the last of it to one location.
969452,irishfield,2016-05-13 16:34:00,26272,How does a man get dragged into a TSC store??? I make trips to Liskeard from TMag just to browse the store. Just wish they'd actually mark correct prices on stuff.. they'd sell more as 9 times out of 10 when you take something to the cash it rings it at 1/2 or 1/3rd what the shelf sticker said.

I was always under the impression it was purely a knick-knacky home-decor type place. I was pleasantly surprised by what I found.

You've got The Shopping Channel confused with Tractor Supply Company, we've got a real TSC in Grimsby, great place, I watch the flyer from there all the time,  just stocked up on their 30-0-8 fertilizer at 1/2 price, which was already a good deal compared to Scott's or C-I-L."
969474,Garnet,2016-05-13 19:26:00,2056,It's a farm co op store great quality.
969477,SirCranksalot,2016-05-13 19:35:00,3291,Good place to go for a fix if you are a long way from Princess Auto!
969479,crappieperchhunter,2016-05-13 19:45:00,2582,TSC in Bowmanville is an absolute joke. I couldn't tell you the number of times I have went in there for a good deal I have seen in there flyer and they don't have it. I have never been in another TSC to compare it to....but guessing by the responses in this thread....they all must be better then this store.  Other issues as well. I pretty much leave every time saying I'm never coming back   Go in maybe once a year for something now and am still usually disappointed.

I go to the two TSC stores in London occasionally and they never have much of what is in the flyer, unless you hit them at the right time.  All fishing tackle in my local stores is now gone.   Still have hunting stuff though."
969559,Old Ironmaker,2016-05-14 05:13:00,8243,"I have gone back to a liquidation store in Brantford that my wife dragged me into called Channel Control. 2 Shimano rods for 30 bucks each. Both 40% off sticker price. A few tables of tackle all 30% off. Live Target for 12 bucks. Worm harnesses $1.50. I went back there to get a 75,000 total BTU Propane that is convertible to NG which I have now for $160.00. If it lasts 3 years I'm good with that, I don't even need it, that will be 3 I have now. A pal that took a ride with me bought 1 as well. A lady behind me snagged 10. The closest comparable BBQ at Home Depot is $325.00 but propane only and 45,000 BTU. Solar lights $1.25 each. Racks and racks of clothes all 40% off, most from Target but many name brands too like Izod and Bill Blass. A Dri-Fit brand name long sleeve shirt was 8 bucks, great for the boat in summer.  Just off Wayne Gretzky south of the 403 in the industrial plaza behind Home Depot."

969563,Old Ironmaker,2016-05-14 05:53:00,8243,Yea I fixed it. What's a few zero's. $150.00 for a worm harness is steep! 22 bucks for a good quality Coleman BBQ cover.  Our TSC store in Simcoe can't come close to Princess Auto anywhere unless you are into farming. I never saw fishing tackle there.

I went in the last week for a new pair of work boots they had on sale. One left in my size. I pulled them out to try them on and noticed all the packing was shredded. Thought that's odd, moved it around and seen mouse droppings everywhere. There was a nest in one of the boots..."
969997,Old Ironmaker,2016-05-17 06:09:00,8243,"Speaking of work boots man what a shock I got when I saw the prices. $200.00 for a good pair, they aren't all created equal. How do you guys that have to buy boots do it? If at todays prices I would have gone through $20,000.00 of boots in my life."
