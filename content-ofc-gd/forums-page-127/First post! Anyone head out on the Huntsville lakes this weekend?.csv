969738,OffsideGuy,2016-05-15 16:58:00,5,I just bought my first boat (16.5 princecraft tiller.) and new to the area. Moved back to Ontario last summer from out west and joined this forum. Haven't had any posts because I haven't had anything to post about. Hoping to get on the water after work later in the week.  Anyone have any updates on where the walleye and crappie populations are at on Vernon?  MB
969740,OffsideGuy,2016-05-15 16:59:00,5,Just want to know if anyone has an idea what the population sizes are and if anyone has seen large individuals. Not asking for anyone's spots.
