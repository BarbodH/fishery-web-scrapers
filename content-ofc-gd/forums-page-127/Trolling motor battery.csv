969597,huzzsaba,2016-05-14 14:28:00,884,Costco has a great return policy.  I think a few guys here run the Kirkland batteries. +1 on costco batteries.  IMO the best!
969634,Tybo,2016-05-14 18:14:00,1373,Low priced flood DC batteries made from 45% to 65% recycled lead are a crap shot. Don't ask too much from them when they get some years on them and you will not be disappointed.  Just replaced my car quest with walmarts.
969648,BillM,2016-05-14 20:47:00,17367,"I checked out the Barrie Costco today, no marine deep cycle batteries at all."
969659,knightfisher,2016-05-14 23:29:00,237,"Bought 27 series from Costco here in St Kitts for 105. Great price. Here they get a handful of deep cycles each spring, and when they are gone, they are gone till next spring."
969660,boombap,2016-05-14 23:31:00,310,"I checked out the Barrie Costco today, no marine deep cycle batteries at all.  I got the last group 27 at the Costco on Dufferin here in Toronto a couple of weeks ago."
969718,Raycaster,2016-05-15 13:37:00,528,"Bought 2 group 27 at Ancaster Costco 2 weeks ago. Didn't see any 31's but the 27's are already heavy enough, the 31's would of killed me.  Bought nice 6g 16' battery cable at Walmart ($29) for trolling motor wiring and put new connectors on. Only need 8' run so hopefully everything will be ok.  Not sure about buying 6g adapter for Minn Kota connector or just trimming some cable strands to fit in without it. Yes, not really the pro way to go but heard the Minn Kota 6g Adapter is cheap plastic anyways."
969330,Hedfish,2016-05-12 15:11:00,76,I am looking for a group 24 battery for my kayak. AGM I think. Which brands/stores do you guys recommend?  I seem to remember some bad stuff was said about the Canadian Tire batteries but maybe I am just imagining things.

969335,DRIFTER_016,2016-05-12 15:36:00,10439,I have nothing bad to say about the CT batteries. I run them on my boat.  However if you have the $$$$ a LiOn battery would be the way to go. Much lighter but a lot more $$$.   http://www.lithiumion-batteries.com/lithium-marine-batteries.php

Certainly looks like a nice battery but my wife will most likely burn my kayak if I buy a battery like that!

969353,KraTToR,2016-05-12 19:06:00,506,"There are only a few different battery manufacturers, they just re-brand them.  I've used deep cylces from Costco, Walmart, and C-Tire and if you take care of them, they are all pretty good.  AGMs are nice because they are sealed and you don't need to check electrolyte levels.  AGMs also come in 2 versions, Standard and Pure Lead.  The pure lead versions supposed to last 2x longer than standard AGMs.  Standard AGMs supposed to last 2x as long as flooded.  According to the marketing material..  For my TM, I'm using 2 grp 29 EverStart Maxx (Walmart's top of the line flooded marine) and they really last and have gobs of power.  I can't recall exactly but I think they were under $150 each."
969388,boombap,2016-05-12 23:50:00,310,"Costco battery here, no problems."
969392,Sinker,2016-05-13 00:22:00,8692,"I just got a new magna charge 31 series deep cycle. Its my second one like it. The other one has 4 seasons on it and still works good, but it doesnt have juice like it onxe did.  I generally run my batteries until they are almost dead. I do a lot of slow trolling eyes, so my batteries dont last as long as most peoples, but i have had other batts that didnt make 4 seasons..  All uou can do is charge them after each use with a quality charger and replace when needed. I cant justify the price of an agm battery when i know i am going to kill it just as fast as a flooded cell.  S."
969398,DRIFTER_016,2016-05-13 01:28:00,10439,If you routinely draw your batteries below 50% charge you will kill them much faster than if you don't. I also use my TM for slow trolling when jigging up lakers in calm conditions. It's hard on batteries.  
969407,knightfisher,2016-05-13 03:27:00,237,"Costco 27 series deep cycle works great. Also upgraded to minn kota maximizer and have, as stated 5 times the battery life."

969436,Sinker,2016-05-13 14:26:00,8692,You would be better to hook them together and run them as one bank.

969445,porkpie,2016-05-13 15:13:00,2521,"I run mine to the ground often.  They don't last more than 3-4 years tops.  I killed a Kirkland in 3 seasons, but I run em until the motor stops.  It's all the slow trolling.  I just put a walmart GR31 up front, I doubt it will make it past 4 years.  I could probably do better, but sometimes I come in real late and forget to charge for a few days etc.  I just resigned myself to buying a new one every few years.  I've had em all, from costco to Canadian tire.  If you beat on em their all the same!"
969448,Hedfish,2016-05-13 15:19:00,76,"So where do you guys buy your batteries? I heard CT, Costco, Walmart. Any other stores? Do Bass Pro and Sail sell them? AGM batteries in particular (I am thinking about AGM to avoid the risk of acid spillage associated with the ""regular"" flooded batteries). Yep, it's for my kayak."

969514,Sinker,2016-05-13 23:21:00,8692," If your just positioning your boat to cast or work shorlines etc....a battery will last a long time. Im willing to bet that the guys who say they are getting more than 5 years out of a battery have never run them down, and don't fish nearly as much as I do, because I have been burning up batteries for a long time, and there is no way to make them last longer than what they do, the way I use them. Running them flat every time kills them, period.  I get mine from my local battery shop. Kawartha Battery in Peterborough. I don't even care to shop around for a price, because its a small family run business, and, well, they are just great people, so I prefer to support them rather than some CEO of costco.....just my choice.  I paid $175 all in for a 31 series deep cycle.  S."
969518,BillM,2016-05-13 23:48:00,17367,That's not a bad price at all for a Group 31.

(Niagara area).  $94.00 for the same Interstate I have.  I paid $165.00 at CTC.  Also trailer parts & accessories his prices can't be beat.  5:30 - 12 trailer tire & rim $50.00.  The same tire/rim at CTC $72.00 when they are on sale!  Spare hub including races, bearings & grease seal $18.00."
