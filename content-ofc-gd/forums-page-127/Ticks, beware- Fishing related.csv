969825,Old Ironmaker,2016-05-16 05:11:00,8243,A guy on another forum found quite a few Ticks on his pants after a day of Trout fishing. A good report below by the CBC. David Suzuki is the talking head though. I'm sure he didn't contribute anything to the report. He's more reporter than Scientist.   http://www.cbc.ca/natureofthings/episodes/ticked-off-the-mystery-of-lyme-disease
969839,Dontcryformejanhrdina,2016-05-16 11:59:00,535,"Our dog has been getting a lot of ticks on him here (Tamworth area). Wear long clothing and a hat out in the bush, everybody."
969843,dave524,2016-05-16 12:21:00,4508,"I've seen reports down here in Niagara, especially the hotspot for ticks along the Lake Erie shoreline since late April. We started our dogs on their monthly dose of "" Revolution "" on April 15th.  http://www.revolution4dogs.com/"
969868,captpierre,2016-05-16 16:25:00,2521,"Sorry to say Revolution is a poor drug for ticks. Fine for everything else like heartworm and fleas. 3 good meds for ticks for dogs. K9 Advantix Nexguard Bravecto. Should start in spring as soon as temps increase above about 4C. Keep going till late fall until temps stay below 4C. Ticks are more active in spring and fall than mid summer. For people, cover up in the woods/tall grass. Check yourselves over end of day. Top to bottom. You won't feel a tick bite or if a tick is attached. They stay on for 4-6 days. Lyme disease transmission requires the tick be attached for 24 hrs or more. Prompt removal is key. Grab it by the head with some tweezers immediately next to your skin and pull straight out. Do not grab it with your fingers. You'll just squeeze bad germs into you. Ticks are nothing to fool with. The worse spots in Ontario are Prince Edward County east to Montreal. The north shore of Lake Erie. Lots of ticks elsewhere but less Lyme disease. Hope this helps. Be safe."

K9 Advantix Nexguard Bravecto.   Thanks, we've already started this year and have purchased a 6 pack for both dogs, I will inquire at the vets about other options next time"
969892,captpierre,2016-05-16 17:51:00,2521,"Or better, Ask for proper tick control now and return the Revolution"
969893,Old Ironmaker,2016-05-16 17:53:00,8243,Ticks were bad here last spring on the north shore of Erie. My wife found one on her abdomen and it was removed just as catpierre suggests. We put it in a pill bottle and it and she went to the Doc's. It hadn't buried itself yet and she is fine. Be careful.
969921,manitoubass2,2016-05-16 19:41:00,11391,"I get like 30 a day at the height of the season. Dont bother me one bit. Get home, inspect, remove, dispose of with a lighter.  I noticed a weird trend up this way the past 3 years however. They come out earlier and are gone much earlier. I wont see any now by about 1st or 2nd week in july.  Same with deer ticks.  No idea why however???  It used to be spring through fall"
969939,GbayGiant,2016-05-16 21:23:00,1780,Lyme is serious. Hard to detect and even harder to treat once set up.  Go figure Cannabis oil kills it!  http://www.naturalnews.com/043834_cannabis_Lyme_disease_medical_marijuana.html
969941,manitoubass2,2016-05-16 21:34:00,11391,My boys grandpa has it. Wreaks havoc on the system thats for sure
969981,pics,2016-05-17 02:17:00,1268,Lyme disease is bad but there is also the Powassan virus to worry about..
969996,Freshtrax,2016-05-17 06:05:00,2215,"meh, lived in north carolina for 6 years . not too worried about ticks just check yourself when you get home and pull them off.  any signs of lyme and see the dr."
970069,DRIFTER_016,2016-05-17 20:54:00,10439,There's now an over the counter test available to test for Lyme if you think you have been infected. Could help with the misdiagnosis I keep hearing about.  http://www.theweathernetwork.com/news/articles/over-the-counter-lyme-disease-test-now-available-in-canada/67869/
