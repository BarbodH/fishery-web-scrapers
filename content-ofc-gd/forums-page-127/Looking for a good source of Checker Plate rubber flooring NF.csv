969223,Old Ironmaker,2016-05-11 03:43:00,8243,"I want to replace my carpeting on the bow casting deck on my 19 foot StarCraft that's 22 years old. I will never match the carpet that I can get from StarCraft because of fading and really like the look of the checker plate rubber flooring. Does anyone know of a supplier in or around the Golden Horseshoe? I see many online but all seem to be out of the USA. It runs around 3 bucks a square foot for 1/4 inch thick stuff. The custom $100,000.00 fishing boat they did up for the Fishin' Canada show has it throughout the boat. The heat it may hold, and I'm sure it gets hot, isn't an issue as I always wear shoes as well as my guests.  Thank you for any help."

969231,Old Ironmaker,2016-05-11 05:43:00,8243,Thanks Buckeye. Easy as that. I never even thought about Home Depot.
969232,OhioFisherman,2016-05-11 05:53:00,6623,"No problem sir, they may not have it in stock, but the ones in my area are pretty good about ordering thing for you."
969233,Smokercrafty,2016-05-11 07:03:00,227,"I noticed this was from the "".com"" site. Checking their Canadian site yields no results for that type of flooring. As long as the States has it, will they still bring it in for you?"

969240,Old Ironmaker,2016-05-11 12:11:00,8243,"It doesn't look like Home Depot Canada has it. I will have to check with the stores to see if I can order it. 7.5'X14' sheets available in the US, how thick I don't know. I don't want a seam Dan as Princess Auto's is 4 feet wide only, but thanks. HD sells it as garage flooring. I will check some flooring stores in Hamilton."
969241,woodenboater,2016-05-11 12:19:00,2277,"I was going to suggest HD as well as I have some. It comes in rolls of about 5x5 or so. Could have been Cdn Tire as well. Actually, I think it was crappy tire come to think of it. In same area as those multi coloured interconnecting rec room floor mats."
