969543,leaf4,2016-05-14 02:35:00,2466,Lol reminds me of this
969544,DRIFTER_016,2016-05-14 02:39:00,10439,A couple of years ago a fellow was driving off the ferry in Homer AK. He was following his GPS which sent him down the wrong path. He drove down the boat ramp into the Pacific!!!
969547,crappieperchhunter,2016-05-14 03:39:00,2582,"I spent 30 years on the Bruce and in the ""TUB"". I know exactly where that launch is and I can't begin to understand how this could ever happen. I pray this woman never gets pregnant and tries to raise children.  Edit to add....I always thought the harbour was considered Georgian Bay and not Lake Huron. The write up says Lake Huron."
969549,Old Ironmaker,2016-05-14 03:55:00,8243,"Man. Greta Penelope Skrufindoodle, she doesn't give the best directions at times. I think we have all had stories about her. Would it not have had to be zero visibility to drive a car into the water? She walked for help. I guess the phone she was texting on was too wet. Lets see, early 20's, late at night, Toyota Yaris, and a woma, I mean person, probably not texting just looking at Greta instead of the road.  She was quoted as saying:  ""Speaking through provincial police, the driver of the car declined all media requests.""  No crap Sherlock."
969550,irishfield,2016-05-14 03:56:00,26272,Pretty easy to drive straight past Foodland and right down the ramp there. Many (drunk) men have done so over the years...
969551,irishfield,2016-05-14 03:59:00,26272,"BTW... at the Collingwood boat ramp this week, guy and gal launching a nice boat with a brand new 2500 GMC. He got out to guide the boat off the trailer, she got in to drive and when he said WHOA, she thought he said GO and she hit the gas and put it all I the lake to the roof. Bosses truck that she borrowed for the afternoon..."
969552,crappieperchhunter,2016-05-14 04:07:00,2582,Pretty easy to drive straight past Foodland and right down the ramp there. Many (drunk) men have done so over the years... So you know the area too Wayne. I still just can't see how anyone could do it. I have had more then a few dinners at the Crows Nest and have never been  messed up enough to do that. I mean its a small area. If you are unfamiliar you drive slow and keep an eye out. If you know the area you just know.  Can't get my head around the stupidity.
969565,Old Ironmaker,2016-05-14 06:11:00,8243,And she didn't know the difference from R and D ???? I better not say anything more. I have been known to do some stupid things myself. Like forgetting the 5 buck plug.
969581,farsider,2016-05-14 12:28:00,456,"Some better shots.  It does look like everything is right in the same place.   https://www.facebook.com/TheTobermoryPressInc/?fref=ts  Cheers, Mark"
969613,OhioFisherman,2016-05-14 16:13:00,6623,"LOL, at least they could see the car? I am guessing that shoreline areas here are not going to have that kind of water clarity!"
969622,crappieperchhunter,2016-05-14 16:39:00,2582,"LOL, at least they could see the car? I am guessing that shoreline areas here are not going to have that kind of water clarity! Water is crystal clear there. If it was 30 feet down you could still see it no problem."
969628,OhioFisherman,2016-05-14 17:29:00,6623,"The visibility in Lake Erie here has improved over the years, but even as a kid it was easy to notice the difference in water clarity between here and up north.  Once the farmers fields dry out enough for them to start plowing and planting here near shore areas will be even worse. The wet spring so far might make for a successful walleye spawn here? Not as much silt runoff because the fields aren't plowed yet?"
969669,John Bacon,2016-05-15 00:32:00,3277,Edit to add....I always thought the harbour was considered Georgian Bay and not Lake Huron. The write up says Lake Huron.  I think that is splitting hairs.  Isn't the bay part of Lake Huron?
969670,FloatnFly,2016-05-15 00:58:00,1640,was she trying to go to the cheech?  she missed the road by a good 20ft.  article says it was foggy
969671,manitoubass2,2016-05-15 01:29:00,11391,"If she was try to go to the cheech, maybe it was already real smokey in her vehicle???"
969674,Old Ironmaker,2016-05-15 02:29:00,8243,Maybe he typed in Osaka by mistake.
969806,Smokercrafty,2016-05-16 00:53:00,227,"I love the looks on the faces of the guys watching the whole fiasco. Priceless! It would be wall material, if she was standing close by all sopping wet, and holding her GPS.   LOL"
969845,Rizzo,2016-05-16 12:43:00,4754,says she had to swim 30 metres. How the heck do you get 100 feet out there. Maybe she kept her foot on the gas for a while hoping to scoot on over to the other side?
969846,Rizzo,2016-05-16 12:45:00,4754,"oh and having worked in Kitchener the past 3 years, it does not surprise me that this is where she is from. Something is in the water in that town."
969857,netminder,2016-05-16 14:49:00,514,I let my wife borrow the GPS once when she had to make a trip to Grand Rapids Michigan. I had it set to avoid tolls so the GPS sent her to the border crossing in New York. She got a fun trip around the perimiter of Lake Erie out of it.
