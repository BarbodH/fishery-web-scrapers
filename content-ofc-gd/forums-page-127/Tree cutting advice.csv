942554,Sinker,2015-10-30 14:45:00,8692,"Yeah, that's way too much. I have a tree guy we use at work all the time. Real good guy, and fair price. If you just want it on the ground, he can probably give you a good deal for cash. Fully insured, climbing gear, and boom truck. I'm not sure how busy he is, but he does a great job for us, and I""ve seen him drop some nasty trees that I wouldn't even consider, and I consider myself pretty good at felling trees.....its part of my job.  If you can drop that one onto your neighbors property, it wouldn't be too bad by the looks of it, but its hard to tell from a photo. Kinda need to be there, standing right under it to see what your dealing with.  S."
942564,lew,2015-10-30 15:26:00,12766,"Peter, I live just a few miles east of your cottage and have used a local guy a couple times to remove 7 large large trees from my property, as have some friends and also a few neighbors.  He can drop a tree absolutely exactly where he wants it to land, and if you don't want the wood, he cuts it into 16' lengths, loads it onto his truck and cleans up the area so good you'll never know there was a tree there to start with.  This guys good and reasonably priced and if you want his name and number PM me.   "
942595,wormdunker,2015-10-30 20:54:00,1711,"An experienced tree climber will scale your tree, in a harness/cradle fashioned of rope he sits in, with spurs & climb & cut your tree into small pieces, then lower them on a rope.  A friend of mine took down a huge soft maple for my neighbour sitting in a rope type cradle.  The tree was on the ground in 16"" pieces in about 5 hours!  Amazing to see him work.  Unfortunately his age & health will not allow him to do this kind of work."
942615,woodenboater,2015-10-30 22:27:00,2277,"Not a professional arborist but it's not as simple as getting a crane or lift and bucking it down. If you're not aware of tension and spring, then a limb could very well snap you out of the bucket and send you to the ground. Accidents have happened with professionals so someone not trained, is an accident waiting to happen.  But yeah, the quote is high, I'd be looking at several others and specifically ask how they plan to take it down. If they take all the brush away and buck it into stove lengths, that would ease the pain.  The fact that the tree is close to your neighbour's property complicates it. Your property and money but I wouldn't hire someone that wasn't insured or trained tbh. ymmv"
942626,crappieperchhunter,2015-10-30 23:06:00,2582,Someone trained could have that whole tree down to a stump in less then 20 minutes. I know cause I've seen it done. My sons friend Jesse did 2 trees for me at the cottage and all he had was 2 chainsaws his harnesses  ropes and his tree climbing boots. Cut off limbs with the small chainsaw as he went up the tree. When he got to the top he switched to the bigger chainsaw and worked his way back down cutting in about 4-6 foot lengths. It was awesome just watching him work. I cleaned up the mess and gave all the body wood to another board member here for his outdoor fire pit.  Jesse is now working for a tree cutting service out in BC or I would be suggesting you give him a call. You should see some of the job pictures he shares on Facebook. I swear if I was 18 again I would take that career path.
942631,SirCranksalot,2015-10-30 23:37:00,3291,So if a tree is felled near a cottage does it make a 'ker ching' sound??
942633,irishfield,2015-10-30 23:40:00,26272,LOL.. figured he was some dumb ass from the city and wouldn't blink at the cost! WRONG!
942651,DRIFTER_016,2015-10-31 01:00:00,10439,PFFFFFT!!!! Just cut the tree down!!!! What could go wrong?
943119,Bondar,2015-11-03 02:02:00,817,I had a huge maple taken down this summer . It was all taken down by a climber and it wasnt an easy job. I paid $1200 to have I removed I cleaned the leaves and limbs up
943137,Chuck Enwinde,2015-11-03 05:53:00,247,"I'll second Chris's advice. I'd be very surprised if he didn't save you a pile.  Plus, John knows a thing or two about the local laketrout population."
943140,Mister G,2015-11-03 12:18:00,1429,"3-4 years ago I hired a crew to take down a maple that was twice as large as that ash tree. The tree overhung my garage and I thought it would be a difficult job for anyone to not damage anything because no matter which way it fell it would do damage. I had 4 quotes and went with cheapest quote I got that was $300+ less then then the other 3 guys.  They showed up at 9 am with 1 guy climbing, two guys on the ground plus the boss. Less then 2 hours later they were GONE and left me just the wood I pointed out that I wanted. Cost $650 out the door......  For that smaller ash tree I would get many more quotes and not pay a dime over 1k....."
943298,pics,2015-11-04 03:00:00,1268,The tree guys are cashing in right now .. there's just too much work available. High quotes are to be expected.. I wouldn't pay more than a grand myself.
943325,Sinker,2015-11-04 13:14:00,8692,Im surprised we dont have an arborist here.....  S.
943341,porkpie,2015-11-04 15:53:00,2521,"I used to cut on the side, small time but still had a truck/ trailer/ full insurance.  If you can find a professional arborist to touch that for less than a grand, take the deal and run.  Make sure you check to see that he has current insurance etc.  A lot of the small time kijiji/Craigslist drop and run guys have zero insurance and you'll be on the hook when they screw up because they wot be insured, and likely won't have a pot to piss in either.  When doing tree removal, even the best guys have an oopsie from time to time, although it's not common.  Best of luck."

943734,JoePa,2015-11-07 15:03:00,179,I had a tree near the house that had to be cut down - rented one of those lifts that I could control while in the bucket - just took my time and cut the branches into small pieces and dropped them to the ground - when I got it to a manageable trunk I tied a rope to the trunk and the other end to my pickup - cut a notch then started cutting the other side - when I got to a point I pulled the trunk over with the truck - after doing it I felt satisfied that I did the job - just take your time
969262,captpierre,2016-05-11 17:08:00,2521,So. Just an update. Through Lew I got the name of a tree cutter. Took my ash tree down yesterday. Haven't been at the cottage but he said all went well. Did it for $1500. Last year's quote by another guy was $2600. This guy was going to take the smaller branches away. For the $1500 I'll be doing that. Now to chop and split. Thanks Lew.
969279,Big Cliff,2016-05-11 22:07:00,6899,Glad it all worked out for you! $1500.00 is still a lot of money but having a pro do it instead of taking a chance is good insurance!
969294,Old Ironmaker,2016-05-12 03:06:00,8243,"How much is the cost for a amateur to get hurt badly doing a job that should be left to a professional? Especially in tight quarters. A 70 foot plus triple clump Poplar cost me $750.00, cleaned up and left 5 cords of the big stuff for camp fires. Money well spent. 15 years ago I might have done it."
941291,captpierre,2015-10-23 16:28:00,2521,Hi guys. I have a 30-40 ft  healthy ash 5 ft away from the cottage on the NW corner. Buckhorn area. I don't appreciate the shade and the leaves/twigs it drops on the roof. A super strong NW wind could potentially bring it down on the cottage. They say all the ash trees are doomed in the next few years thanks to the emerald ash borer. I'm thinking its time to take it down. I'm not very experienced at tree falling. When is the best time of year to do it? I can cut it up for firewood. Should I call an insured arborist?  What can I expect to pay?
941295,captpierre,2015-10-23 16:35:00,2521,The tree from my neighbor's side where it would like fall 
941299,captpierre,2015-10-23 16:37:00,2521,From the front 
941301,chris.brock,2015-10-23 16:43:00,4053,"Maybe you have more experience than me, but I wouldn't touch that.  This summer, I had 4 big poplars dropped by an insured pro (just dropped, I cleaned it up)I didn't feel comfortable felling, it was $425 plus tax. Pretty cool to watch the guy do it too.  edit- I think it's possible to buy a vaccine for that ash tree if you wanted to keep it, no idea how much that costs"
941302,manitoubass2,2015-10-23 16:47:00,11391,"Get a pro, without a doubt.  Its leaning, or appears to leans toward the house starting about 10ft up.  Be tough to direct that any other way without some assisted force imo"
941303,manitoubass2,2015-10-23 16:49:00,11391,Too back ua couldnt get a skidsteer in there
941305,Sinker,2015-10-23 16:51:00,8692,"IF its not dead, I would leave it as well. If its alive and healthy, there is very little risk it will come down in a wind storm.  If you can drop in onto your neighbors yard it doesn't look too bad to fell, but your side looks a bit dicey with the buildings there.  I know a guy who could do it for ya if you really want to take it down. Pm me if your interested.  S."
941309,DRIFTER_016,2015-10-23 16:58:00,10439,Check this video out. It's what a good arborist can do with a chainsaw and a few wedges. This guy is amazing!!!  
941313,Sinker,2015-10-23 17:10:00,8692,^....nothin to it!  S.
941316,woodenboater,2015-10-23 17:46:00,2277,"get a proper feller/arborist and make sure they insured. no leeway on the insurance. based on that photo, they're probably going to need a climber or bucket to take the top down. looks like too many obstacles for a notch and cut drop."
941334,Big Cliff,2015-10-23 18:52:00,6899,"I spent years working in the bush and from that first picture that tree is going to the right. There is way too much weight on that side for it to come back across those cedars (unless you had some very serious equipment to literally pull it back over) and even then you might stop it from falling where the weight is but it would probably spin on the stump and come down to the side. Also, if it did come down on those cedars it would make a mess of a few of them.  From the second picture it looks like you might be able to take it down and drop it between the house and the shed, the limbs are high enough on it that it would probably work but it is a little hard to tell from a picture.  Regardless of what it is going to cost to have a professional take it down, more important what is it going to cost if it comes down on one of your buildings?"
941335,mr blizzard,2015-10-23 18:57:00,1589,"We have brought down a few trees in our time including some on friends or relatives property BUT in this instance I agree with Chris and others, get a professional who is insured, your buying your own firewood without doing $1000s in unnecessary renos"
941339,Dara,2015-10-23 19:07:00,3052,"I would leave it and hope it lives.  Other than that, there are a couple decent logs in the bottom...not the greatest but I really like ash as a furniture wood.  And a pro to take it down  I should just say, aww heck, just cut it, whats the worst that can happen"
941341,SirCranksalot,2015-10-23 19:18:00,3291,I would approach that very carefully with my 15' pole. I wouldn't touch it at all with my 10' pole!
941361,Rod Caster,2015-10-23 21:52:00,5784,"Looks healthy, and if it stays that way it has a long life ahead of it. White Ash's can get quite big.  I wouldn't cut that on my own unless I really hated the property owner. haha.  Pro all the way if you choose to cut."
941363,dave524,2015-10-23 22:08:00,4508,"I'd leave it , has the ash borer even made it to your area yet? If and when it gets infected there will be time to get it down before it gets to be a hazard."
941383,Sinker,2015-10-23 23:18:00,8692,"Not much of the ash borer up that way. Dont transport firewod, and it wont get there as fast either!  S."
941392,FloatnFly,2015-10-23 23:54:00,1640,"out in the bush, drop it yourself, tight spaces, call a pro, i can recommend a good one"
942497,captpierre,2015-10-30 01:36:00,2521,"So. Update on my ash tree. Called a local arborist Just about fell off my chair when I saw the quote. $2600 to cut down, and take away branches and leave logs in 4 ft chunks. Another $200 to cut small. Shoulda been an arborist."
942499,irishfield,2015-10-30 01:48:00,26272,"For $2600 I'd climb it and cut it piece by piece with a hand saw for you! Hell I could rent a crane, rig it to the upper limbs and make a single cut at the bottom. They're out to lunch for a 4 hour job.  You'd be better off to let it fall on your house and pay the $1000 deductible for the repairs."
942500,smitty55,2015-10-30 02:00:00,928,"OUCH. $2600 is a huge pile of coin to pay, but they kinda know they got ya, plus at least you get the satisfaction of knowing they're insured and really know what they're doing, so the chance of misadventure is slim. Wouldn't surprise me at all if other quotes came in the same ball park. On the other hand, I'll bet that nice healthy tree is looking better all the time right where it is. Good luck with it.  Cheers"
942511,chris.brock,2015-10-30 04:30:00,4053,"They're trying to screw you. Post the name of the snake or the business.  I had 4 poplars felled, 3 were giant, and 1 was leaning towards the cottage, for $425, it took about 1.5 hours, John and 2 students.  John at Boshkung Tree Service, you could Email him the photos, he's not too far away."
942514,Big Cliff,2015-10-30 08:42:00,6899,WAY too much money for that job! You can rent one of those high lifts (will take you up 60' ) and take it down limb by limb for a couple of hundred.
942518,wormdunker,2015-10-30 09:37:00,1711,"$2600.  Wow!  I'm in the wrong trade!  Rent a 30 ton boom truck with an attached man basket.  Most crane rental companies would be about $150.00 per hour = $600. includes the crane operator.  1 guy in the basket for less than 4 hours, that tree will be on the ground in small pieces."
942540,Headhunter,2015-10-30 13:20:00,5703,"If you think that price is bad, try getting a quote in the city!!!! My old neighbour had a Manitoba Maple (weed tree) with one branch hanging badly over his garage. They charged him roughly the same amount to remove that one branch and yes, he did get multiple quotes. I'm thinking an OFC gtg with some chain saws and a couple of nimble climbers and tree problem solved! HH"
