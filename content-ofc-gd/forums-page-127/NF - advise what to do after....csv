Provincial Privacy Commissioner's office would be a call I'd make, if for no other reason than to have the incident recorded within their database. I agree with others, if you want to keep your job, calm down and ask for a meeting with HR to GET THEIR ADVICE AS TO HOW TO HANDLE THIS WITHIN THE COMPANY. If you want to lose your job, go in their guns a blazing. HH Just read this now and I'm off to work, I'll look it up and call, thanks Joe  Very first thing I would do is purchase Equifax credit monitoring. They will notify you if anyone makes a credit application in your name to confirm it is you. If it is your employers fault, have them cover the Equifax cost.  If I were in your position I would do this immediately. Criminals move fast... Good idea and thanks."
970197,dave524,2016-05-18 16:13:00,4508,"I'm  guessing the only reason they knew they messed up is an honest person received you info and alerted the company to their mistake and returned it. Take a deep breath, most people are honest."

970257,Old Ironmaker,2016-05-19 00:00:00,8243,"Great advice to get Equifax. I advised he see a Lawyer because it appeared he had a lot of ""what if's"" on his mind. Often first consults are at no charge these days. I also said earlier that you can't bring a law suit against anyone until you have damages. Being p'd off doesn't count.  I am sure Geoff's blood pressure has dropped today compared to yesterday.  Are you feeling a bit better today Geoff?"
970267,Smokercrafty,2016-05-19 01:19:00,227,"I can only imagine what the OP is going through. I'd personally crap my pants and do something I'd probably regret in the near coming future. But there has been some good advise here so far. The only piece I could lend, is possibly calling an employment lawyer. From listening to AM 640 over the years, a name that rings well in my ears is Lior Samfiru. Don't have his number handy unfortunately, but I'm sure Google does. A long shot possibly, but something I'd try. Hopefully it all pans out, and your info hasn't fallen into ill hands.  Good luck."

970099,GBW,2016-05-18 02:05:00,8460,"Hey all  So what is one to do?  I got a letter from work today saying sorry we messed up (basically) because at the start of May they sent ALL my personal info including DOB and SIN to someone in error and showing this 'random person' my earnings over the past 20 months too!  I mean they sent it all!  Didn't catch it for 2 weeks too!  What can I do to protect myself AND can I do to go after them to pay for any damages that may come from this?  With all my info someone can go buy what ever they want to right?!?!?  I'm SO FUMING MAD right now I'm ready to walk into work tomorrow and snap on HR!  Even if she wasn't the one that did it...  What do I do now?  *edit* Side note: can anyone else see a trend of some serious bad luck I have going on here as of late for me, am I now cursed?  I sure as hell feel like it!!!"

Decided a beer and a smoke and ask here before I ""jump the gun"" so to say  In any case you have to keep a level head.. I would consult a lawyer first before confronting HR.. Yeah but what type of lawyer as the only one I know is local and did my divorce and family law...  Any ideas there folks?  I need to protect me, my info from fraud and now worry about loss of wages spending time at Service Canada to ensure nothing has been done with my ID...  If I have to, I'll go after them full tilt only if I know I won't burn up all my time and money doing so and will walk away in the positive.  I'm not one for this ""sue because of..."" stuff but this company has really been ""playing with the rules"" for my sales team as of late too so I'm ready to fire back at them..."

I would also pen a letter to the company indicating you received that letter and basically they are on notice for any damages that may occur in the future.Don't send it to HR, it may or should I say probably deep 6 it.

TKS again BRO and I look forward to your info and those others in the legal area to get back to me.  IN SHORT: If you were given ALL DATA about a person you can now go and fake it to be said person (photo ID clone is easy in this day and age).  I know I could should I ever want to be that loser and wind up in jail for doing so..  Never will I though...  I have too much personal info in front of me daily I don't want more...  Here I sit, been trying to sleep since 12 and wide wake now still at 2:45AM with NO CLUE how this is going to turn out.  The ""person(s)"" they sent this too has my whole ROE (record of employment) now and can do as they wish with it and my info.  It takes a second to get an email and save it to a USB device to use down the road (or even hit FWD)...  So PISSED and FRUSTRATED and want to ensure this never happens again with my employer or others.  I NEED to find answers.  I'm ready to go to corp and have people terminated due to ignorance here (but that's how angry I am) and those of you that know me that's not my style. If I post your name, DOB, SIN, Address and more and sure as ____ you would be after me cause so many can now find you and fraud your ID and take you to ""the cleaners"" right?  Time to protect me 100 fold... Still looking for more legal in please... Thanks! G__ (for privacy)"
