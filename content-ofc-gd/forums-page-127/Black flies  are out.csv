969095,DaveRoach,2016-05-09 21:52:00,202,"Couple of bites in Buckhorn, Itchy as heck. They were in swarms, thank god for open water."
969329,Beans,2016-05-12 15:10:00,3339,Saw a few swarms of skeeters as I drove down the road on my electric scooter to get the mail...didn't get any bites but that is coming I'm afraid...
969332,BillM,2016-05-12 15:15:00,17367,"Lots of buzzing out on Gbay yesterday, but no bug bites."
968665,captpierre,2016-05-05 21:26:00,2521,Near Buckhorn. Quite a few. But nobody biting. Yet.
968670,NAW,2016-05-05 22:34:00,4022,"They are thick in midhurst, that's for sure!"
968671,Terry,2016-05-05 22:37:00,14456,real bad around Mclean lake
968672,kickingfrog,2016-05-05 23:05:00,8333,"They are thick in midhurst, that's for sure!  Ya, we're skipping the park (and the yard) for the next little bit."
968676,can u fish,2016-05-06 00:22:00,326,Yup black flies are out north of Parry Sound and they just posted a total fire ban for our area today.
968699,Dara,2016-05-06 02:57:00,3052,about time..wish it was warm enough for them here
968726,wormdunker,2016-05-06 05:23:00,1711,Any reports of flies north of Sudbury?  I'm planning walleye opener in that area.
968730,Old Ironmaker,2016-05-06 08:42:00,8243,"I hate flies of any colour. Horse fly bites and my face blows up. We are going north for the opener and my Bro reminded me that I need to bring a mosquito hat and face thing. Oh no, I forgot about that."
968763,Freshtrax,2016-05-06 14:13:00,2215,Hope it gets hot and they die before my trip to nipigon in June......not counting on it.
968769,Joeytier,2016-05-06 14:32:00,3990,Flies are still at least a week off here.  Late May thru most of June will be brutal.
968780,netminder,2016-05-06 15:42:00,514,Was swatting away mosquitoes this morning. No sign of blackflies though.
968786,blaque,2016-05-06 17:25:00,2419,Whats a black fly  :)
968792,Blue Lk,2016-05-06 19:09:00,337,"Same thing every spring. Sorry to say,but maybe you ladies should just stay in your kitchens & paint your toenails. Man up & go fishing"
968795,irishfield,2016-05-06 19:44:00,26272,"LOL..yep, skitters have been out for almost a month here in Ptang and the black flies have been thick for over a week. Once we get to Tmag they usually come out right about noon on the Friday of the long weekend, as they know that there is fresh meat coming to town!"
968799,kickingfrog,2016-05-06 21:26:00,8333,"Same thing every spring. Sorry to say,but maybe you ladies should just stay in your kitchens & paint your toenails. Man up & go fishing  Tone deaf or just stupid?"
968800,aplumma,2016-05-06 22:04:00,6896,Whats a black fly  :) The heavy duty bombers of the mosquito squadron I heard.lol   Art
968836,Beans,2016-05-07 13:15:00,3339,"They were thick as thieves yesterday and I didn't bring my OFC bug jacket...fortunately they wern't biting yet...just swarming around our heads and getting in mouths, ears and eyes...A good wind came up and they took off..."
968956,Fisherman,2016-05-08 19:26:00,7201,Not biting but poking in the eyes is extremely annoying.
968970,Joeytier,2016-05-08 22:18:00,3990,Ya you definitely won't have bugs!
968980,Raycaster,2016-05-08 23:43:00,528,At least LSC mayflies don't bite... I think. 
968991,ckewley,2016-05-09 02:14:00,699,"Probably not a true report but there was F.A. out today north of Minden, good wind and what felt like snow weather probably helped"
969023,blaque,2016-05-09 12:17:00,2419,The heavy duty bombers of the mosquito squadron I heard.lol   Art Thankfully they dont have operations down my way
969027,AKRISONER,2016-05-09 12:57:00,5558,"they were out saturday, but then it started raining, and then it snowed...so much for a fire ban and worrying about the heat"
969076,Joeytier,2016-05-09 19:28:00,3990,"-1 last night and again tonight, doubt I'll see much or any bug life on my camping trip this weekend."
969085,fisherman7,2016-05-09 20:31:00,325,Lots of mosquitoes out at Ennismore last Friday. Weren't biting yet though.
