478196,limeyangler,2010-06-22 16:39:00,5204," Thanks Jacques, the only real challenge recently is 'Limey' finding time to fish!    darn....you guessed right...my secret is out!  A lot of people asked why i was not in the Walleye masters...my excuse...no live well.....lol...the real excuse....i dont know where the big fish are on the goon yet...and i dont want to pay a $300 entry fee to prove i dont know...lol.    Thanks corvette, yup...it certainly made up for the lack of fishing recently...mind you i would have settled for no fish too....just being out in the boat on a beautiful morning (by myself) was worth the wait.    Thanks Bill...the bass were on fire...but i was already an hour late so had to draw on every ounce of will power to drag myself away from a hot topwater bite and get home reasonably on time and actually be a father on Father's Day.    Thanks JB...will do!"

478344,discophish,2010-06-22 22:17:00,392,Thanks Simon for posting the video.  Always fun to watch your videos.  Pretty soon you will have the sponsors wanting to advertise themselves in your segments!  I'm surprised Rapala hasn't come after you for all of the success with the jiggin rap!
478365,Cudz,2010-06-22 23:24:00,2652,Very cool vid.  I do the same with my Vex.  Always fun.
