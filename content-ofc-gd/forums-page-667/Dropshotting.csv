477012,msp,2010-06-18 14:50:00,1336,"Hey guys, Getting things ready for bass season. Just wondering what baits the bass guys like using for droppshotting smallies. I have used slammers and various gulp products. Im looking for something new to experiment with. Thanks,"
477014,alexcba,2010-06-18 14:54:00,634,i have seen people drop shot with every form of soft plastic lol. one of the bass guys i know loves to drop shot a long worm into cover and make it dance.. pulls out some good fish.
477022,wankerjohn123,2010-06-18 15:13:00,117,Good video. 
477037,bdox,2010-06-18 16:17:00,329,Keep an eye out for some new stuff from strikezone!
477052,uglyfish,2010-06-18 17:29:00,981,"u can use just about any kind of soft plasitc to dropshot with. i like using slammers, and jackall products. but i use other things from time to time dependinng on how the fish are acting."
477053,JoshS,2010-06-18 17:32:00,729,I personally like to drop shot with Gulp alive leaches and minnows. Also done well with the 4in senko style baits and shaky worms.
477060,BillsTheBassMan,2010-06-18 17:52:00,932,Bass Magnet Minnows (soft plastics) are just about the hottest thing going for drop-shotting right now.
477062,mbac31,2010-06-18 17:59:00,904,"I use Berkley Gulp Leeches, Bass Magnet minnows, Nories and Ecogear Lady fish, and the Flat Fat. Jckall has a very nice one, OSP has a new one on the Market right now. I will dropshot just about anything including Fplastic frogs. Strike Zoze has some very nice products and as stated coming out with some very nice stuff soon. Worms, even the 10"" VERSIONS i WILL DROPSHOT IN SHALLOW WATER."

477248,Cudz,2010-06-19 04:15:00,2652,strikezone slammers.  Followed by gulp leeches then gulp minnows
477799,oates,2010-06-21 18:05:00,151,"Chompers Finesse Worm (4 inch slim worm)  Garlic and Salt flavour  due to it being so thin, it is very twitchy and I caught more than 75 bass on them last year.  Only $4 at Bass Pro"
478106,Harrison,2010-06-22 12:49:00,2202,"Slammers rock, so do gulp leeches (there an echo in here)  Another go to for me is the ole' thin bass pro tender tubes.  Been dropshotting worms, brush hogs and lizards around docks and on weedlines for Largies for sometime now when i can put the jig rod down.  Usually smack more SMB though! Will be again Saturday!  woohoo.."
478107,bucktail,2010-06-22 12:52:00,1857,"I have had super success with the 5 inch skinny gulp worm in pumpkin, The thin worm moves alot more natural then other Gulp products which seem to be too ridgid for a subtle presentation."
478331,Drew_10,2010-06-22 21:41:00,111,Slammers
478551,leechunbao,2010-06-23 14:28:00,23,Slammers like this
