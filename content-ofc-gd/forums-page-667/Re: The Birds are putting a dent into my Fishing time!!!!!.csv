478336,TroutnMuskieHunter,2010-06-22 22:00:00,1362,"I recently purchased a boat lift for the new boat so that I could ensure that one, the Muskrats wouldn't get in and chomp on the electrical cables and second, I could try and keeep the Ottawa River ""grime"" off the boat.  ..I put the lift in around 4 weeks ago...  So, I finally wait for the Muskie season to open up here and get the boat in the water only to find that we have visitors that have decided to camp on the boat lift and the wife is adamant that they be our guests and are NOT DISTURBED under any circumstances!!!! .  ..so now I've got to launch and take the boat out whenever I want to head out which is a pain in the arse!!!!  Here's what they look like....I'm hoping they'll soon Flock-off so that I can finally leave the boat in and use the lift 8)  Here's Mom...       "

478342,lew,2010-06-22 22:10:00,12766,Seems the birds like waterfront property too Steve
478343,TroutnMuskieHunter,2010-06-22 22:13:00,1362, How true Lew....I don't mind for now. It gives me an excuse to get out and do more Trout fishing for another few weeks!!
478346,Terry,2010-06-22 22:21:00,14456,nice spot to hold your muskie bait..live bait that is
478375,irishfield,2010-06-22 23:47:00,26272,Yah that's what I'd be doing with them Terry...  They'd be better than the local ground hogs for sure..
478397,Dave Bailey,2010-06-23 00:36:00,1641,"Ah yes, eastern kingbird. Their scientific name, Tyrannus tyrannus, is very apt. Feisty little chaps."
478500,pikehunter,2010-06-23 11:36:00,1659,"BB gun. Just joking....I think. Next year make the nesting spot undesirable and with luck they will find a better location. Don't get me wrong I like birds but there is a place, and that isn't it."
478501,canadadude,2010-06-23 11:42:00,769,"Fun to watch though, they'll be gone in a few weeks.....maybe try a plastic owl or something to deter them from nesting.The thing is once a bird finds a good nesting spot they will return to it next season."
