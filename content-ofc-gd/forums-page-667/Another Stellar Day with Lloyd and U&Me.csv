477636,Jet,2010-06-21 01:45:00,364,"The title says it all. What I love about fishing out on Lake Ontario is that most people I know have never experienced fighting monster Salmon and Steelhead out in the big Lake, only ever playing with them in our local creeks and rivers. What a difference it really is.  So once again I got another newbie out, and another good friend who hasn't been out on Lake O for over 20 years and accompanied my girlfriend and I for some big water fishing.  The action was consistent for most of the day with times where the rods were just lighting up. The first two fish hit before Lloyd could even finish setting up. In the end we had 5 missed hits, 1 lost and 14 successful fights. If you haven't had the chance to try fishing out on the big water, I highly recommend it, especially with Lloyd. The fishing was great, but the company today was even better.  Enjoy.     The day started out with a few steelhead like this, fresh and full of spunk.     Then a King came out to play.       She had those Steel dialed in all day!    And here's another.      After a 20 minute fight my good friend had his first deep water Chinook. Watching him battle this brute made my day! It weighed in at 24lbs 5 oz. There was a rumour that Lloyd broke 30 the day before...      And just as our time was about to expire, in came a bonus Brown.      Thanks for reading."

He's the one that made it all happen, so full credit and praise goes to him. We just reeled up the fish!"
478222,asdve23rveavwa,2010-06-22 17:45:00,2690,"Good stuff!!!!!  Lloyd is great out on the water, takes care of his people, knows his stuff.  I'm watching for the next opening for salmon/trout!!"
