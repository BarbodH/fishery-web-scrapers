478534,bow slayer,2010-06-23 13:46:00,1074,Well I am off on saturday up to Restoule for 2 weeks. I am planning on leaving around 4am. Instead of going up 11 I will be travelling up 69 to the Lavigne area. Will I encounter any security checks along this route? I am asuming 11 will be a nightmare and I am thinking there will be some security on 69 as well.Anyone have an idea what I will be running into travelling 69 about 8-9am saturday morning?Maybe I should leave earlier?
