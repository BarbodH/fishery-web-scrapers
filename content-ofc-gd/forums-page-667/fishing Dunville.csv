478080,skinny,2010-06-22 11:15:00,442,I have been invited to go fish in Dunville this is for some family bass derby. My cousin has asked me to go he pays we use my boat. So I'm all in but I have never fished down there so i have no clue about the area. I'm not sure I will be able to get down to fish before the derby. any pointers
478130,uglyfish,2010-06-22 14:12:00,981,cover water... look for marinas with docks if ur fishing the river for bass. they are tough to come by in there but theres some around.
478133,alexcba,2010-06-22 14:23:00,634,yeaahhhhh... gotta watch for those DICKS at the marina..

478188,Fish4Eyes,2010-06-22 16:33:00,1022,"Your going to the wrong place if your expecting to catch bass. I would reconsider your options or change your target species to carp, catfish or pickerel."

478416,Court R,2010-06-23 01:33:00,213,"Run to the lake, find some rock piles and throw some jerk baits & spinner baits."
478420,johndox,2010-06-23 01:41:00,54,Lots of places on the Grand to fish for bass like around Cayuga and Caledonia but Ive never heard of Dunnville being a good spot unless you do like Court said and run to the lake.
