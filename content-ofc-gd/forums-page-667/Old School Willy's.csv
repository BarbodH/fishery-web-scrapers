477843,bushart,2010-06-21 20:50:00,2628,Got out today but it's been quite a while since my last adventure.  All reports I heard was bad so I was not overly optimistic.  There was a west wind about 15 km pretty much all day---All the locals keep tellin me I need to fish heavy in the weeds this time of year---tried it for a bit and watched them and me catchin zip.  Sooo I tapped into the experience files and caught fish----windblown rocky points---anywhere from 12-17 fow---I was fishin for food today---funny thing---I'm by myself (or with all my friends)and I could only keep one walleye over 18 inches---1st one I caught 20 1/2---never caught anything all day under 18--so I brought home 1 fish---closest I got was 19 inches--oh well it was fun.  Bait of choice today---perch coloured spinners and worms.  Here's your livewell shot.
