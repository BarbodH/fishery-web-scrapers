478596,Twocoda,2010-06-23 16:35:00,4130, set out a saucer of milk ...see what happens
478597,bare foot wader,2010-06-23 16:46:00,1354,"re: no pics....when you're on foot in the bush and you're stalked by a 150 lb cat, is grabbing your cam the first thing on your mind?....bangers and knife is what goes through my mind first.....  even in their highest concentrated populations you rarely see one inside of 100 yds, you need to have the right lense to get a pic of it and you only have a few seconds to snap the pics....  pics can be altered and will always be argued....DNA/scat is firmer evidence IMO"
478616,torco,2010-06-23 17:41:00,656,I saw lots of cougars when I lived out in oshawa. Pretty sure its a designated sanctuary...  Also a great place to hunt mullets.
477962,siwash,2010-06-22 01:45:00,683,
477976,Ben_Daniels,2010-06-22 02:00:00,435,Thats pretty cool!  I saw a couple at Crocodile Rock's in Toronto on the weekend...oops other kinda cougar.
477980,southpaw24,2010-06-22 02:02:00,32,didnt need the confirmation from the paper to know that. seen one and some tracks before
477989,Dozer,2010-06-22 02:08:00,896,I wish I could spot a cougar.  Cougars are dope.
477994,Rizzo,2010-06-22 02:23:00,4754," ..don't believe him, I just tried rolling one and it tore me a new belly-button"
478014,BillsTheBassMan,2010-06-22 02:54:00,932, I don't think he was talking about that kind of cougar.
478034,DRIFTER_016,2010-06-22 03:21:00,10439,"  Yep, we had one come through our property in Grand Valley one February about 6 or 8 years ago."
478071,Whitespinnerbait,2010-06-22 09:05:00,2038,No pics........   Just another fishing story.......
478072,archer379,2010-06-22 09:35:00,277,my wife has a uncle that lives up near apsley and has pics of one in the back yard from 5 or 6 years ago
478180,moemoe,2010-06-22 16:26:00,352,Glad they took the pic from the zoo for the story
478308,jayess,2010-06-22 20:41:00,187,I do a lot of camping in the south Algonquin region and have spoken to many locals who'd sworn by their presence.  It's very cool to finally hear confirmation. Thanks for sharing this!
478322,tb4me,2010-06-22 21:06:00,3295,There had been cougar sightings here in Brantford up untill last summer.Right here in the city. Kinda freaked out some of the city folk...If I remember correctly it was in the Brantford Expositor a few times.
478354,speedtroll,2010-06-22 22:53:00,52,what a shock! Not  The Ministry have known about them for 15 years plus. Can't figure out why they denied it for so long. I guess its just like denying the spring bear hunt isn't needed here.  Politicians?
478360,Big Cliff,2010-06-22 23:10:00,6899,"I can't confirm this, I wasn't there but the story goes: a local farmer called the MNR complaining that a cougar was attacking his calfs. The MNR insisted that there were no cougars in this area, it must be a dog or coyote bothering his calfs.  The farmer told them that if that was the case he would just shoot it, they told him to go ahead but if it was a cougar they would charge him because cougars are protected. Now why would they say that if they didn't think there were cougars in this area? Apparently they figured he should just file a claim for compensation.  Last I heard, he did shoot it and it got burried in the back of his farm and it sure wasn't a dog or coyote. How can the MNR charge someone for shooting something that doesn't exist?"
478373,danbouck,2010-06-22 23:38:00,4380,  I held back all day!!!
478380,irishfield,2010-06-23 00:07:00,26272," Don't know why he'd bury it Cliff, he should have called the local press! A farmer does not need a game licence to shoot anything in the way of ""pest control"" or ""herd protection"". Doesn't matter what it is..."
478382,irishfield,2010-06-23 00:08:00,26272, Sorry Dan.. it just doesn't work on a 20 year old with no wrinkley arm skin..
478384,alexcba,2010-06-23 00:10:00,634, LMAO!
478398,danbouck,2010-06-23 00:36:00,4380," Google it and see what happens, That's the only one I could post"
478399,Whitespinnerbait,2010-06-23 00:37:00,2038,Again ...no pics ....no Cougars....
478466,bigfish1965,2010-06-23 03:35:00,3382,"The law that protects them is species specific, and no one knows if they are indeed indigenous or released. If a release/escape then it is not protected. But the law also referred to the wrong sub-species but since there were none to protect, it never got fixed."
478476,Big Cliff,2010-06-23 08:56:00,6899, That would explain why (if the story is true) it got burried. I wonder if they will be fixing that law now?
478478,siwash,2010-06-23 09:24:00,683,  Why would the OMNR release this statement if it was a complete fabrication?  
478482,singingdog,2010-06-23 09:53:00,1047,Pretty thin article...and poorly researched. There are multiple instances of cougars attacking human beings in BC alone.
478488,Hawg Hunter,2010-06-23 10:20:00,204," well folks i hunt gan just 15 mins east of kingston,been hunting there 22 years with my brother,the last 5 years theres been reports of these great hunters,one report 2 years ago (from gan)a lad called the mnr on his way ta work and told them he just hit a cougar with his truck,the fellow on the phone replied there are no cougars here,then the fellow replied ""oh"" ok i just thought you'd want your radio tracking device back but its ok don't matter ta me,then the lad says hang one one min,another lad got on the phone and asked him where,when this happen,the lad told him and left for work to open his store. no clue how this ended my brothers not seen the lad sense all this happened but there are many reports of these great hunters in that area,but it just seems strange that no one has had a camera/cell phone ta take a pic of these cougars,but then again i guess big foots been around a long time as well.  not sure where i stand on all this hard ta think with all the sightings no one has had a camera or cell phone on them ta take a pic,well all i can say is if i ever come across one hunting deer ill protect it all right lol.lol,funny ta read they are no danger ta people,i wonder if they people found dead on a bike trail in the U.S thought the same thing when they were attacked and half eatin!!!  Hawg Hunter  just my 3 cents lol"
