As for line, 12lb mono or 12lb fluoro? Not to sure on line but I got a wack of crankbaits and i ant to start throwing them more so a key setup is what im looking for.  If anybody has crankin rods for sale shoot me a PM...that goes for a reel too.  Hope to hear some thoughts on what a proper crankbait fishing combo has.   Thanks, Mike"

The Loomis cost a lot more than the Shimano, but with a crankbait rod there isn't much to choose between them. I use braid with a knotless leader on one reel, another reel loaded with 20# Fluorocarbon and a third with 20# Mono-filament.  I like the heavy Mono with Frogs, Toads and big top-waters, like Zara Spook's. The heavy Fluorocarbon sinks quickly and takes deep-divers down with it. The 40# braid with a leader is my favourite for all around use. I switch leaders to match the bait I'm using. Garry2R's"

I don't have experience with the Croix casting rods, but I own the 7' Medium Moderate action Legend Tournament Walleye Spin and it's one hell of a rod in terms of sensitivety, so the Avid won't be far behind.  As for reels you can't go wrong with anything middle of the road from Shimano or Daiwa....although a Daiwa Zillion would look pretty snazzy on an Avid..."
