On the weekend of June 4th, 5th and 6th I loaded the boat and the boys and we headed off to fish and enjoy the Mudcat Festivle in Dunnville.    Here is a summary of the entire weekend... The kids had a blast, the fireworks were amazing and if you ever need a place to camp... Fishmasters rents out an awesome trailer right on the river at a great price!          Perch, silver bass, walleye, sheephead and the occational out of season smallie...  What a great weekend with Steve and the boys. !  Can't wait to get out again.."
