477285,the-instructor,2010-06-19 11:51:00,16,"thanks guys, put up a decent fight too. Fish was caught out of one of the small lakes up by stoney  no real public boat launch btw."

477301,Fish Farmer,2010-06-19 12:32:00,2234,Nice Walleye. Was it a Erie fish or northern lakes? Got any info?

477398,Leecher,2010-06-19 21:34:00,7832,Awesome instructor Short story but very nice indeed!!!  Congrats Leechman
477410,BillsTheBassMan,2010-06-19 22:36:00,932," Great Fish Man, a Beauty Indeed."
477700,lew,2010-06-21 13:30:00,12766," the-instructor already explained that this fish was caught in zone 15, NOT 17 and is a legal fish to keep. Unfortunately, this post has been altered and some responses have been deleted so now it's hard to figure out what's going on"
477724,basserone,2010-06-21 15:15:00,7," My apologies, I did not see where it stated zone 15, like you said, must have been a previously deleted post.  Still a nice fish."
478151,alexcba,2010-06-22 15:08:00,634,"  seriously tho.. these arguments aren't needed, congratulate the man on his fish and move along. we should be cheering each other on, not putting each other down."
478170,the-instructor,2010-06-22 16:10:00,16, finally some one who shares my views
478258,limeyangler,2010-06-22 19:21:00,5204,Really nice fish instructor...beautiful colors.
