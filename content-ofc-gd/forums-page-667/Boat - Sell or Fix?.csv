Boat is probably 20 years and the motor (60hp Merc.) is a 94 I beleve.  The floor on the casting deck and middle to back end has started to get really soft and I'm not sure if I want to try and get it fixed or just sell the thing.  The hull seems to have no issues right now and the motor is also fine.  I have no experience with fixing something like this nor do I have any idea what the cost would be to fix it or have it fixed.  Just wondering if there is anybody on the board that would recommend something or if there is anybody that would be interested in a bit of a fixer upper.  From what I can tell it's just the floor that needs to be redone.  I have had the boat out every year since I bought it and it runs fine in the water.  I'm just afraid my foot is going to break through the wood on the casting deck one of these days.  If it makes any difference I'm in Hamilton.  Also, thought of just taking it to the cottage out towards Kingston area and putting it up for sale there so it doesn't take up driveway space.  Thanks, JFish"
