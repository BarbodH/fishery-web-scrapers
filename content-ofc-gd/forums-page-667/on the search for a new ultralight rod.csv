478285,JohnF,2010-06-22 20:03:00,3494," Once I find a cheap flexy rod that balances nicely with one of my UL reels I have no problem casting light lures. In fact that's probably where I find the whippy rods really shine - launching lures with no weight to carry themselves out on the cast. It's just a matter of getting the timing sorted out.  As for sensitivity you probably have a point but I feel enough of the taps to have a little fun the few times I go back to the UL rods. I may well be missing a few though because of a lack of feel.  I get yer point about hooksets but when I use a really cheap rod with light mono I get lotsa cushion, at least for the little fishies I run into. I never get to hunt little bitty trout so I have no idea how hard the hookset has to be for them.  I used to enjoy playing the fish for a long time but I've kinda been brainwashed about getting him in, off the hook and back to the water. It just doesn't feel right tiring the little guys out any more. Finding and hooking them is the fun part now.  I'm not saying you guys who choose to go with expensive UL's are wrong. I'm all for running the best gear you can afford. And if I was in a location where I could hunt panfish and little troots all the time I'd for sure have a sweet UL rig or two. It's just that like most fishermen I'm on a wife-imposed budget (sort of) and I'd rather shoot the bigger bux on the gear I'm gonna use most of the time. If I had an unlimited budget I'd be trying all the best UL's and matching reels to them till I found a combo that felt really nice. New gear is always good.  JF"
478287,BillsTheBassMan,2010-06-22 20:04:00,932," Yeah, that may be true, but that's where it is up to your personal experience and ability to ""feel"" a rod come into play.  I rarely just grab a rod off a shelf on a first rod-shopping trip and pay for it right then and there."
478291,JohnF,2010-06-22 20:13:00,3494," I agree. Now that I've had a few okay rods and had a chance to fish them I'm starting to know what I'm looking for off the rack. I really can't tell for sure though until I bolt the right reel to it. Even then it sometimes surprises me out on the water with different lures. I think it's why I've become so partial to braid lines. They feel much more consistent than mono.  I've still got a lot to learn but that's fun, and also part of the reason I spend so much time reading here.  JF"
478309,BillsTheBassMan,2010-06-22 20:43:00,932," Yep, that sir is 100% right.  The best part now is about problem-solving.  Where are the fish, why are they not biting, what else might they bite, is my setup proper, did I approach correct, should I approach from somewhere else etc.  That's most of the fun right there.  The fish you play for a long time now are the ones that PLAY YOU for a long time - the big fellas."

478395,aplumma,2010-06-23 00:33:00,6896,John F I purchase my first handmade rod from Spiel a few years ago and have not found a shelf rod that matches it.He has since built me two more as I slowly replace my St. Croix and Loomis rods. The differences mainly was the attention to detail and quality of the material. I found that the reel seat and blank were hand bedded in epoxy which made for incredible sensitivity. The guides were spaced not for economy like most of the lower end rods but were spaced for strength in the blank.The corking that I chose was a burl cork which was a pain to work but the end result was excellent.It addressed my issue of most handles were to thin and made my hand go numb. The final rod while more expensive than a Loomis is a rod that is exactly what I want and feels like an extension of my hand which is how every tool should feel like. I can also say that I would not have been able to create this rod with out the guidance of Chris and this type of expertise is worth the price paid.   Art
478408,Duckie,2010-06-23 01:05:00,305,"someone mentioned Loomis and I have to agree: their ultralight rods are AMAZING.  I have the SR841-2 IMX, which is a 2 peice 7 foot UL rod from their trout and panfish series and it is incredible.  above there is a discussion about inexpensive vs expensive UL setups, and I have to admit:  I have cast this one side by side with an  inexpensive Quantum UL rod (5'6"") and the difference is like night and day.  it cast way farther, and its not 'whippy' like many UL rods out there.  but don't get me wrong: it is truly UL power.  the only problem with a rod like this is that it is expensive.  but then I have always managed to justify the cost for nice tackle by the amount that I fish.  most of us fish often enough to make it well worth the investment for great equipment.  yeah, so the rod cost $200 and the reel $150... but if you use it all the time, its totally worth it.  <at least thats what I tell myself haha>"
478423,JohnF,2010-06-23 01:52:00,3494,"  Way back when my son was in his early teens and showing signs of the golfer he would become we got into club building. I think we got pretty good at it. I think it was not unlike rod building in some ways. Unless you started with quality components there was no way the end product would be decent. The problem was that no matter how much we spent or how hard we tried we really couldn't do much better than pretty good. The best we could do wouldn't compare to the high end factory clubs.  I gather that's the difference between building golf clubs and building rods. By all accounts here Spiel's output rivals or exceeds anything one can get with a big name on it. One of these days when I've figured out just what I should look for in a great rod, and if Chris is willing, I might just have to spring for one of his creations.  JF"
478483,singingdog,2010-06-23 10:02:00,1047,"The UL Compre is a moderate action rod....the flex goes right down into the butt of the blank. If you are looking for a faster action UL, Fenwick and Berkley both make very nice ones that come in at about the same price."

479047,MJL,2010-06-24 16:09:00,2427,"Depending which headwater streams you plan on fishing, a 6-7ft UL might be on the long side for what might be practical.  In all but 1 or 2 streams I fish, anything longer than 5’-5’6” is too long to effectively pitch baits and lures to spots without smacking trees and bushes around you.  A shorter rod may also pitch lures and baits more accurately in narrow, tree-lined rivers.  Just something to consider.   If you’re thinking of building rods and getting parts from Canadian suppliers, Angling Specialties has parts.  You can also get them from here (from B.C): http://www.rodbuildersupplies.com/  or here in Caledonia http://www.jccustomtackle.com/  Hope this helps"
478063,chefboi17,2010-06-22 05:45:00,128,"as the title states, i'm currently on the search for a new ul setup, (already got myself a small quantum pti tour edition). my search through lebaron and bass pro have pointed me in the direction of the 6' shimano compre ultralight, i loved the feel of the handle, and the rod just seemed to feel right to me. i was mainly wondering if anyone here has experience with this rod, and negatives to share etc before i spend over a bill on it. also if there might be another rod to look into getting. my current light setup rod is a 6'6"" lightning rod, and my ul is an 5' ugly stick (virtually no sensitivity, i know) what i'm looking for is a comfortable grip, and 6' or longer"
478085,Jer,2010-06-22 11:35:00,1426,"You can't go wrong with a Compre. I have two (medium action casting and spinning) and they are very good rods for the money.  I have a Shimano Carbo-Max for an ultra-lite and while it's a decent rod, I would much prefer the Compre version."
478099,BillsTheBassMan,2010-06-22 12:37:00,932, In my experience with Ultralite Setups I have found that the Shimano Rods have less feel to them than the St. Croix rods.  The grip on St. Croixs are amazing and the sensitivity is second-to-none.  You won't go wrong with an Avid or a Premier.  I went with a 5'6 premier and it has been absolutely amazing.  Try your hand at it before you buy anything and see how it feels.
478110,canadadude,2010-06-22 12:57:00,769,"Those Compre rods are pretty  sweet for money, the only one I would go for over it is the Loomis, but that would set you back another brown one. I'm not a big fan of St Croix, but thats just me. If it feels right for you then grab it, being happy and confident in your gear is halph the battle in this angling sport."
478114,BillsTheBassMan,2010-06-22 13:29:00,932," The people that don't like St. Croix generally don't like them because of the fact that if you break it you have to send it to Wisconsin for warranty and wait about 5 weeks.  I do agree that you need to feel comfortable, and love, your own gear.  A lack of confidence in your setup will get you into bad habits and get you off your ""A game""  The Loomis is INCREDIBLE.  It's easily the top of the line and will probably be the next ultralite I buy - its price tag is in the $230 department, but all you have to do is pick it up and you'll know why.  Good Luck Deciding."
478116,Raf,2010-06-22 13:41:00,3495,"It's tough to suggest something like that over the 'net.  Go into a store, try all the brands and find one that feels best to you.  Bring the reel you plan on putting on it as well.  Not that I've ever busted one but, if any of my st. croixs did break, I'd take them back to point of sale and have it replaced on the spot.  No shipping Bull - Pays to deal with quality retailers."
478123,BillsTheBassMan,2010-06-22 13:56:00,932," I've busted one St. Croix and the retailer (Chad @ Rainbow Sports) sent it away for me, called me when it was back, and charged me $10 (which beats the $25 St. Croix says it will cost).  I generally prefer St. Croix rods, so whenever buying one I ask the retailer ""If this breaks, will you send it back for me?  Do you do that here?"" and they generally say ""Of Course We Do.""  It's to the point now that I don't have to ask the two stores I frequent the most - Rainbow Sports and Fishing Fanatics."
478127,canadadude,2010-06-22 14:08:00,769,"Thats alot better then Loomis, it cost me $75.00 to get one replaced plus shipping and 6 wks without my rod.Loomis warranty sucks,but it is what it is and I do enjoy there rods,I find St.Croix's alittle heavy,but I know lots of fishers that love them."
478128,Raf,2010-06-22 14:10:00,3495,The best warranty is a quality rod that doesn't break.  I think buying on the basis of warranty is silly.  I don't care if it's lifetime or 30 day warranty - neither is much good to you while you are on the water.

478186,BillsTheBassMan,2010-06-22 16:32:00,932,"  Your comment of ""the best warranty is a quality rod"" goes without saying and is obvious in any rod purchase.  Well, warranty does matter, but I don't buy on warranty and I barely factor it.  99/100 broken rods are not fishing related or manufacturers faults (on higher end rods anyways).  People step on them, break them in their truck, etc.  SOMETIMES a rod will break in a snag, or a fishing scenario where a rod just shouldn't break . . . all of a sudden the warranty matters.  Here is why the timeline in a warranty matters:  IT DEMONSTRATES HOW CONFIDENT THE COMPANY IS IN THEIR OWN PRODUCT.  I see a 60 day warranty or a 1 year warranty and really wonder what kind of quality the rod actually is, whereas a 5-year or a lifetime shows more confidence.  Also keep in mind that some rods get abused while on the shelf at your local store - your warranty can matter here too.  I've broken one rod while fishing in my life, it was a quality St. Croix, the company confirmed there was a flaw in manufacturing (OR IN THE STOREROOM WHERE I BOUGHT IT) and they replaced it no questions asked.  Regardless, I'd like to restate that I don't factor the warranty that much in new-rod-purchase, but it doesn't hurt to see what it is, and ask a few questions."
478198,BFSC Kevin,2010-06-22 16:42:00,1351,"I got me a cheap shimano carbomax UL. Since I was going to use it for panfish mainly, I didn't really want to spend too much on it. For the price of a g loomis, you could pick up 5 of those new shimano voltaeus which come with lifetime warranty. But it comes down to if you want to spend the cash and if the extra refinement is worth it for you."
478200,Raf,2010-06-22 16:46:00,3495,If a rod is going to break due to a defect (factory or in-store abuse) it will happen within the 1st few times you are out.  It is not something that takes years to manifest itself.  I don't disagree with you though.. demonstrating faith in your product by offering longer warranties is a good thing.
478213,JohnF,2010-06-22 17:19:00,3494, I'm just cynical enuf to wonder how many companies offer a great warranty because they know it looks good and even if their product is no better than the other guy's they'll make enuf extra from the sales it gets them to offset a few warranty claims.  JF
478219,bare foot wader,2010-06-22 17:37:00,1354,with most high end brands a lifetime warranty and expectation of claim(s) is factored into the selling price of their product

I started off with very lite rods and small reels and liked them for the river wading. But I got into better rods to find some backbone and I have a hard time understanding the rationale of going to a $100 or $200 rod that feels so much like the $25 rods I was trying to escape. I asked one guy why and he said it was for panfish mainly but also for the fun of fighting the odd good sized like a bass that caught you unaware. I get the fun part but I'm not sure i can't have the same fun with the cheapies I have standing in the corner.  I looked at the Compre UL today but honestly it just felt like some of the cheap stuff I set aside a few years ago. Mebbe the feel is better and the warranty but I have a few cheap rods that were good enough for feel for me and who cares about warranty on a rod that probably cost less than $25. In fact my fave UL was $6 in a bin at Gander Mtn. It was really nice till I snapped the tip off (in my basement) after a couple of years of fairly steady use. It caught everything from Sunfish through bass and even one 30"" Pike.  If I'm gonna lay out $100 - $200 it'll be for something I'm going to use regularly.  JF"

478262,bare foot wader,2010-06-22 19:23:00,1354,reason for UL is it's about balancing and sensitivity...sure you can throw a size 0 spinner on a medium action rod with 2 lb line if you want...but it's not the same as throwing it on a proper outfit...balanced outfit will cast further and be more sensitive...you need the lighter action rod to cushion the hookset and not rip hooks out...gives more fight out of the fish
