So if you miss the good old days when you could hear The Champs tales on The Mighty Q you can hear him via the inter web @ Rock 101 Vancouver"

479133,JohnF,2010-06-24 19:13:00,3494,I may have told this story here before but here goes anyway.  Back in my curling days not so long ago we were entered in a week long spiel that required us to drive to different clubs each night for games. One of the guys brought along a Champ tape/cd and we'd listen all the way to the venue. The other rinks couldn't figure out what was wrong with us when we started quoting punchlines and giggling like fools. Funny thing was that was the best we ever did in the spiel in I forget how many years of entering.  JF
