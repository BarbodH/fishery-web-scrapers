478391,alexcba,2010-06-23 00:21:00,634,never fished the lake.. don't know why anyone would want to after hearing how they treat the people there.. hope your fishing goes well and undisturbed if you do go.
478393,sauce,2010-06-23 00:31:00,219,Puslinch has lots of fish. If you know how to catch pike you can get lots. Mostly small though. There are bonus nickel largies and weed walleyes but its mostly a pike/ panfiish lake. I don't fish puslinch with walleye as my target. Stick to pike or bass methods and you might be surprised.
