Asked what they wanted ... a day of fishing for Salmon was the answer.  So we booked all day Monday with Steve (fishmaster) and off we went... Here are some of the fish we caught.    I couldn't have spent time with a better bunch of people... Thanks to Steve, Dad, and Zachary for hanging out...    We went 20 for 27 in 100 - 180 feet of water... Catching fish on Riggers down 48 with Moonshine spoons , wire with NK's, leadcore with Michigan Stingers, and braid with dipsy, flasher and cutbait... The fish were not being picky at all.                        Dad and Zach had an awesome day... Thank you so much Steve (fishmaster) for taking us out.  I heard nothing but compliments on how you run your boat from my dad on the way home.  "
