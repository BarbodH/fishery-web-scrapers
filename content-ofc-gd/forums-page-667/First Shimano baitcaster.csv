477349,MCTFisher9120,2010-06-19 16:11:00,3761,"Picked up my last little pile of stuff before bass season starts up. Purchased a Curado 200E7 to go with my Legend Tournament 7'H frog rod...and some tackle haha.   This combo feels so right and light. Very excited to get out Froggin!   Cheers, MTBF"
477359,lew,2010-06-19 16:42:00,12766,"That reel is a quality product Mike, you'll be happy with it."
477360,Pangle,2010-06-19 16:42:00,64,That didn't take long to replace the revo. haha.  You will be very happy with curado especially paired with that rod. Enjoy  
477362,MCTFisher9120,2010-06-19 16:52:00,3761," It does feel a bite nicer, you were right...it balances out a bit better too. Enjoy the revo, makes for a nice Pike/musky reel...its a workhorse!"
477368,Duckie,2010-06-19 17:31:00,305,very nice setup
477369,scugpg,2010-06-19 17:31:00,1373,Hard to beat a LT series rod. Nice setup!
477433,MCTFisher9120,2010-06-20 01:33:00,3761, Do you have or have used the 7'6MH LT ? It's a telescopic so im a little iffy on it and its much cheaper than the Xtreme 7'6  Has anybody used the LT pitching rod I guess is my sub question...much better price point but not to key on it being telescopic.  Thoughts?
477558,young_one,2010-06-20 20:54:00,620,"As the gangsters would call this combo, Ball'in!!!  Nice combo, tight lines!"
477563,BillM,2010-06-20 21:09:00,17367,Great choice on the reel!  Should be a workhorse for sure.
477570,cpguy29,2010-06-20 21:52:00,148,Nice! I have the new Curado too. Its a great reel and Im loving it!
477713,fish-miester,2010-06-21 14:27:00,864,"curado is a nice reel. not as ""tough"" as the revo but still a beauty reel ! you wont be let down.."
477716,bigfish1965,2010-06-21 14:38:00,3382," I think thats the same rod I saw Spiel doing a tip eye replacement on..just keep a look out for that. It seemed it wasn't on very deeply. The curado is a great reel with the Castaic being only slightly better for pitching and flipping, but too much more money to make up for the advantage it gives you."
477775,ecmilley,2010-06-21 17:15:00,2163,"I have a legend tournement telescoping it's had no problem hauling hawgs out of the slop and it sensitive and light to boot, i paired it with a core pitchen reel and it's awesome"
477880,MCTFisher9120,2010-06-21 22:20:00,3761," That's what I was wanting to hear! As long as I don't overly ""open and close"" the telescopic part of the rod it will hold it's strength. But...Xtreme rods are sick...it might be worth it to get the lightest rod for something like a 7'6. Don't get me wrong, I'll do my hmwk and find the best rod for the price...we shall see what i get, wont be buying another rod/reel until september time."
477884,thalweg,2010-06-21 22:34:00,112,Your new outfit is a setup that many professional bass anglers use.  Light and responsive.
478113,RudeBuoy,2010-06-22 13:20:00,28," I've had my 7'6"" LTB for a couple years now. Awesome rod. Also, I'm sure you've Karl on Extreme Angler TV really haul on his. No issues."

478230,leechunbao,2010-06-22 18:19:00,23,"Curado baitcast reel is aowsome! I have 2 have love them so much. Actually curado is desigend for weightless & fitness  fishing. The lower version of curado named ""citica"" also worked fine for me."
478283,fish-miester,2010-06-22 20:00:00,864,haha nice Bdox. what rod is that on the far left? split grip..cork handle.. baitcast..
478315,bdox,2010-06-22 20:56:00,329," That is a 7' Frontier, it has been sold to another member here. Actually, that photo is from May, a couple of those rods have been replaced."
478475,Bondar,2010-06-23 07:44:00,817,"  That picture is worth more than most peoples cars LOL!!!! LOVE IT   I just bought that exact reel but in a lefty, got it sunday, by monday at 2 pm  it had 4 eyes on it a 20lb carp and a wack of sheap head LOL i like it way more than the revos i've had"
478484,MCTFisher9120,2010-06-23 10:04:00,3761, Saw this pic on another forum..great collection. I want a Xtreme 7'6MH soo bad...it's just not fair
478552,fish-miester,2010-06-23 14:29:00,864,hmm whos signature is on that cumara?
478612,bdox,2010-06-23 17:28:00,329,The Cumara was supplied by Dave Mercer for a charity auction held by OFC. I was the high bidder.
478768,MCTFisher9120,2010-06-23 22:00:00,3761,Looking for a rod in the 6'8 to 7'M action class. Baitcast...anybody got any St Croix's for sale?
