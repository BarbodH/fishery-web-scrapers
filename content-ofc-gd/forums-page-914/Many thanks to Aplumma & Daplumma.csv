290019,misfish,2009-01-09 20:59:00,29133,"Just like to say a special thanks to Joe and Art for the reel and the bait. I wasnt sure what I would be using it for,so I told the boys not to worry about spooling it up,but with the bait that was sent with it( a very nice bonus surprise BTW TY) I,ll be spooling it up with 80 PP and it will be my new reel for pike and musky.    Thanks again fellas   "
290023,Big Cliff,2009-01-09 21:10:00,6899,They are both a class act for sure
290035,aplumma,2009-01-09 21:35:00,6896,You are more than welcome.... Since you were unsure of the line at the time we figured we would give you an incentive to go big.  Joe and Art
290065,irishfield,2009-01-09 22:56:00,26272,Good stuff Brian !!  Joe and his little brother Arthur... no finer !
290083,Roy,2009-01-09 23:32:00,13728,"Very nice, Brian. I agree, those two boys are some of the finest I've met. I'd be proud as hell to call them my sons. But, I wouldn't wanna start any rumours."
290158,Daplumma,2009-01-10 02:24:00,1961,"They are OK,they smell a little bit funny though.Enjoy it Brian,I have to admit this was all Art's idea. Joe"

290868,aplumma,2009-01-11 21:11:00,6896, What Joe doesn't know is the lure came out of his tackle box....so he did help.   Art
290893,misfish,2009-01-11 22:02:00,29133,"Well Art,weather it came from Joes or your box,it was a great gift. I will do me best to get a nice pike on it and post. When the season arrives.  My pop was by today, and said nice reel ,and we could of used that bait in our last pike tourney,LOL"
