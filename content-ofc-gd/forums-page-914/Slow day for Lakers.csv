It was great to see that a few snowmobiles had used the trail since the dump of snow we got during the week, but we still had a whole load of slush to contend with out on the lake.   We were set up by 8:30am......and waited and waited, lots of baitfish schools swimming through on sonar......but zip...nada....nuffink...biting. I tried for whitefish again...but nope...nothing.   It was a nice drop off where we were, going from 0-55' FOW 50yards from shore, with a nice shelf about 20ft from shore at the 25ft depth, this is where our few fish came out.   We built a fire and snacked on smokies, always nice to build a fire.   We did catch 3, the first one went back...a bit small, the second one had shoulders and is the best one i've iced so far, the next 2 got off, and Dale landed a good one near the end. All in all a very slow day, not the slowest either of us had had....but slow. Great weather, although we were in the shade most of the day, but no wind and not cold.    Her'es the piccy/video of the day's action.      2ND FISH OF THE DAY WAS DEFINITELY A KEEPER            ONE GOT OFF....ONE DIDN'T  <embed width=""448"" height=""361"" type=""application/x-shockwave-flash"" wmode=""transparent"" src=""http://i263.photobucket.com/player.swf?file=http://vid263.photobucket.com/albums/ii158/vishuscirquel/Movie-1.flv"">"
