290157,John Bacon,2009-01-10 02:22:00,3277,I haven't tried it myself.  A friend of mine says that it is great for pike and has perch as well.  It was quite a few years ago that he fished it; I am not sure if it is still as good.
290160,Weeds,2009-01-10 02:27:00,782,I've fished it before and never caught anything but I also hear it's good for pike. I didn't explore the whole Bay but what I saw of it was very shallow and muddy/mirky. Tons of Carp in the summer.
290362,bigredfisher,2009-01-10 19:56:00,300,"i have caught tonns of pike you can get the odd trout and walleye. the pike fishing is hit and miss and you may see ideots driving on the ice but please dont drive out there and STAY AWAY from the channel and youll be good you will know what i mean when you get there. like i said it is hit and miss  hope this helps , let us know how you make out, give me some fish porn cause im stuck here in newfoundland and have no clue about the fishing here lol so take lots of pics fish or no fish, just need that to hold off for 4 months lol bigredfisher"
