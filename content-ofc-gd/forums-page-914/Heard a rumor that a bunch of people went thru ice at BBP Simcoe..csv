290664,Guest skeeter99,2009-01-11 11:59:00,0,  no you are good to go in the beaverton and port bolster area and the south end of cooks bay with the atv's and sleds  there are already running the bombardiers in beaverton and I know Tim Hales will not run then without 12 inches of ice  it really depends on were you go it is a big lake  I was out with my ATV on wednesday about 3 km south of beaverton  11 inches of ice or better   and yes the perch were just hammering
