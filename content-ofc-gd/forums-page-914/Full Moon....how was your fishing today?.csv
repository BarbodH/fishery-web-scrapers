I was contemplating at first whether I wanted to get out, drill holes and set some lines for a measly 45min of daylight but I'm glad I did....The full moon tonight rising over the hills while the sun was still setting was just breath taking to see   ...and a few Walleye were caught which made it even better!!  Kept one for dinner tonight and threw the other two dinks back....  Hopefully the bite will continue tomorrow!    "
290464,Cudz,2009-01-10 23:42:00,2652,Nice job. Don't lose that truck.

Cudz...I've lived on this river for over 20yrs now and don't take chances......there was over 13"" of ice where I was parked  Hey Jacques, thanks for the invite to Mc'Bay but I think I'll stick to my local hard water here....not to fussy with cleaning and eating Pike   ....you guys are more than welcome though to come up to this stretch of the river for some Walleye if ya want  Hey Glen....are ya tellin' me that the 2009 OFC Tourney is officially ON  ....and you're my coach/Captain again    ....."
290548,Whitespinnerbait,2009-01-11 02:04:00,2038,Sounds like a plan
290568,Leecher,2009-01-11 02:26:00,7832,  Yeah sure sounds like a plan..... what time are you going out Steve?
290578,Fishing 24/7,2009-01-11 02:46:00,709,hey thats a great idea steve !  ill bring some extra $$$ and go thru your musky lures with ya!  its going to be my turn...... SHOP TILL I DROP musky lures!!
290678,TroutnMuskieHunter,2009-01-11 13:32:00,1362,"  Hey Jacques,  I normally don't go out until around 3:30PM because the walleye bite doesn't seem to turn on until around 4:00 through to around 5:15PM....but, you guys can come out a lot earlier if you want to try for some Pike and Perch...I can't find yours or Paul's phone numbers so give me a call at home!!...You guys can either walk out or follow my truck tracks from the back yard...   Hey Kev...I'll put together some of my Muskie baits that I want to sell.."
290681,walleyemaster,2009-01-11 13:34:00,325,fishing was great yesterday..was on simcoe and caught my first whitefish off of snake island
290715,limeyangler,2009-01-11 15:13:00,5204,"Firstly....NICE WALTER!  Fishing for us(lakers) was the slowest day so far this year....it was a really sunny day....i'm beginning to see a pattern...i dont do well for lakers when its a clear day, regardless of moon phase!"
290901,Fishing 24/7,2009-01-11 22:18:00,709,HMMMM. would the sun affect the bite? On the ice i mean?!  maybe for trout.... finiky fish.  for pike and bass (qc) side  light atracks them.... always had a good day when it was sunny!  never tried for trout .... closed during the winter time !
290979,nancur373,2009-01-11 23:55:00,1211,Nice one. Good eatin.  Curt
291001,Handlebarz,2009-01-12 00:26:00,3790,"the ice on the river is to thin for this stout fellow but i took my daughter to fish for some gills we hit them hard my buddy came out he only kept 11 for a snack but we brought alot through the ice I had 50+ my daughter was around 10 but she had spent most of this trip making snow angles (for some odd reason mine always have horns???) and Steve had many I did not keep track of his it was a great morning for us.  One of my other friends hit a river and caught one eye but there was a sketchy 2"" of ice there."
