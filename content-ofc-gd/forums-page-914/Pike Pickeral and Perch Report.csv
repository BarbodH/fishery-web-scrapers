291344,Moosebunk,2009-01-12 17:51:00,3970,"Jacques,  Nice to see that for the amount you get out and fish (lots) that the fish still can put a big smile on your face.  Nice eye.  Good job fella."
291396,Leecher,2009-01-12 19:53:00,7832," Steve, it's close enough for me, bring them cigars anyway   Thanks Kev.... They're already in filets and ready to be eaten   Thanks Andrew.... real happy to get the skunk off"
291247,Leecher,2009-01-12 14:01:00,7832,"Thanks guys..... for those who notice saugers in the pics are right.  Steve's first and third and my 15""er   Thanks Mike.... There's still lots of time left!!!   Thanks Dave.... your right, pic #4, 6 and 8 are saugers.   That is so true Grimace about the characteristics and behavior.   Thanks Bruce.... Sure was a fun day and the perch really love the fry in white color.  You can also get them in chartreuse.  I'm sure that you'll be surprised at the results.  If you give it a try, let us know the results   Thanks Matt.... I'm glad the skunk is off and 3 of the 7 came back for a snack, including the 15""er   Thanks Don.... It's not so bad without a shack and being able to drive with the car can always sit inside the vehicule to warm up   Thanks again Steve..... sure was a lot of fun... will have to do it again for sure.  Will keep in touch!!"
291249,trapshooter,2009-01-12 14:04:00,1234,Looks like you had a great day out there Jaques.  Thanks for the report.  A bunch of sauger in that lake eh.
291253,limeyangler,2009-01-12 14:15:00,5204,Great stuff Jaques....always a relief to get the skunk monkey off yer back! Congrats on the first of many eyes this season!  PS....those fish fry work awesome for whities too
291265,Leecher,2009-01-12 14:38:00,7832," Thanks Ben.... Yes the saugers seemed to be more present in that part of the Ottawa river.  In the Gatineau river we do catch some, maybe 1 out of 6..... was surprised to see more then one caught and the meat has a sweeter taste to them"
291294,Leecher,2009-01-12 16:00:00,7832, Thanks Simon.... feels real good to land my first and hope not the last Were supposed to be targetting whities next weekend or the one after and will definitely try the fry Thanks again Jacques
291295,TroutnMuskieHunter,2009-01-12 16:02:00,1362," Jacques mon chum....I wasn't going to burst your bubble last night after seeing that smile on your face but today's a different story  The WALLEYE skunk is still on  ......Sauger, Perch and Walleye all belong to the same family but are different!!!  We can't bring the cigars out yet until we see you holding a true Walleye"
