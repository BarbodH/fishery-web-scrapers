290394,Jen,2009-01-10 20:56:00,833,As you all know it took Sonny forever to catch a pickeral in the river last winter...for no lack of trying he became known as the carp king... lol  So this year he decided he was going to work extra hard to break that streak.  Saturday started early with light just hitting the horizon we set up just outside of Fishmasters... It wasn't long after an hour or so that Sonny brought in his first Pickeral through the ice this year.  The black hut is us  Congrats to him as it was a long wait last ice season before he could say that.   I had a great day fishing with my brother! Thanks so much!  Jen
