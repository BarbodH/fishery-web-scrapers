290640,Stoty,2009-01-11 05:51:00,2910,"Ya, too bad the prices weren't recession like! I was really disappointed with the lack of ""specials"" and Bass Boat dealers. Can't say I'd waste my time/money again."
290667,danbouck,2009-01-11 12:40:00,4380,"I would have been disappointed if I was looking at buying a boat. The boat I bought last year was $3000 more at the show this year. On the plus side we got a couple hats and a shirt from Angelo, Pete and Mike from Fish'n Canada. They are great guys!"
291139,ohhenrygsr,2009-01-12 03:53:00,947,Just a heads up Radio World had awesome deals on 08 Model Lowrance GPS/Sonar units.  The one i was most interested in was the LMS-522C IGPS for only $595 and the LCX-27 was at a amazing $950  Also if anyone is looking for smaller drypacks they had them for $5 perfect for Cell Phones and wallets.  There was also another booth selling Viking Rain Coats and overalls for $39.99 each piece awesome deals.  Thats pretty much what caught my eye well and besides the Bass Boats and Motor Manufactures lol
291142,ohhenrygsr,2009-01-12 03:57:00,947,VIKING “TEMPEST II” RAIN PANT   • rip-stop poly/PVC fabric • elastic waistband • full length 2-way zippers • articulated knees for improved fit and comfort    VIKING “TEMPEST II” RAIN PARKA   • rip-stop poly/PVC fabric • waterproof zippers • inside pockets • detachable hood    Of course they where offered in many colours
291146,beertech,2009-01-12 03:58:00,118,Iv been shopping for a boat now for awile and deals are hard to come by.  With the canadian dollar everything has gone up 20 percent. I have also heard of production cutbacks so the demand will be higher
291194,Stoty,2009-01-12 10:47:00,2910,"I think I will look at the states for one. Apparently there are TONS of Repo's taking place, so there are lots available. Not to mention their economy is hurting a lot more than ours, so they are willing to cut a deal."
287118,forrest,2009-01-03 00:23:00,1032, thats the info!  thanks diiggyj
287120,maybe,2009-01-03 00:27:00,307,"Could we please start figuring out what day we're going?  Jeff and I really would like to meet up with everybody else, but we have to submit our on call schedules by Monday."
287208,Stoty,2009-01-03 06:18:00,2910,Most likely will be the 10th for me.
287236,diggyj,2009-01-03 14:11:00,548,"Just so you guys know, every day they are having a door crasher where they are giving away a 14' aluminum boat, so some of you may not need to buy your first small fishing vessel, might get one for free.  Also kids can wn a 14' aluminum at the kids fishing hole.  PARKING IS FREE ALL THE TIME"
287248,Radnine,2009-01-03 14:43:00,1538,Parking is free?? What have I missed? Jim
287255,diggyj,2009-01-03 15:03:00,548,"The show is at the INTERNATIONAL CENTRE, 6900 Airport Road, Mississauga, Ont  PARKING IS ALWAYS FREE THERE."
287256,misfish,2009-01-03 15:05:00,29133,"   I made the same mistake but it is not there,,,,,,,,,,,,  See what’s new NOW at the Toronto International Boat Show! Find the boat of your dreams—and everything to go with it— at the Direct Energy Centre, Exhibition Place."
287275,maybe,2009-01-03 16:06:00,307,"I think there's some confusion about which show is when/where.  Just so everybody's on the same page, the spring shows:  Toronto International Boat Show (what we're discussing right now) January 10-18 2009 -  Direct Energy Centre (parking $$ below)  Spring Fishing & Boat Show February 13-16 2009 - International Centre (free surface parking)  Toronto Sportsmen's Show March 18-22 2009 - Direct Energy Centre (parking $$ below)   The Direct Energy Centre's parking page shows surface lot locations, and entrances to the garage under the hall.  Rates as of July 1, 2008:  Surface $12.00 ($9.00 after 6:00pm) Underground: $12.00 ($9.00 after 6:00pm)   Just across Lakeshore Blvd are 2 parking lots for Ontario Place (Google Maps satellite shot).  There's a catwalk between the 2 lots that connects them to the Direct Energy Centre lots.  I've seen people park there before for shows at the Direct Energy Centre.  The Ontario Place website is kind of lacking, but I'm guessing if parking was $5 on Dec 31st, it's still $5 now."
287276,diggyj,2009-01-03 16:18:00,548,"OK, that clears it up. I was Talking about the Spring Fishing and Boating Show.  I don't need to go to the Boat show, because I just bought a new boat(Legend) at the end of 2008.  I want to see some fishing stuff since I am getting the itch to hit the water after watching WFN daily."
287374,Radnine,2009-01-03 21:21:00,1538,I'll likely go to all three. They are just about perfectly spaced to help me maintain sanity until the boat comes out again.
288170,JeffBornFishin,2009-01-05 23:23:00,260,Looks like were going this weekend.  I have to work 17-18 weekend.  Now just gotta sort out Saturday or Sunday
288346,Stoty,2009-01-06 10:54:00,2910,My dad and I will be scoping out Bass Boats this Sunday! woooo
288352,Guest skeeter99,2009-01-06 11:28:00,0,"if you want free parking for the boat show at the direct energy centre  park at ontario place there is a parking lot on the lakeshore just west of the princess gates, about a 3 min walk to the direct energy centre, in fact it is just acroos the lakeshore you can see it   have been doing this for years at sportsmen show and boat show"
288792,Radnine,2009-01-07 02:46:00,1538,"Me, my nephew, and at least two B-in-L's will be there bright and early Saturday morning (10:00 ish). I'll be the good looking one in the OFC hat and no underwear. There are some great speakers booked to appear on Saturday as well. Jim"
288803,Bernie,2009-01-07 03:00:00,3190,If any of you folks visiting the show are swinging by the Crestliner booth my son Nick is going to be hanging out there. Please stop by and say hi to him. He's a great kid and he is really doing a great job. This is him with his demolition derby car this fall. 
288809,purekgw,2009-01-07 03:07:00,585,does any one know if they have kayaks there?
288869,Radnine,2009-01-07 11:40:00,1538,"Yes, loads of them usually."
290088,tinbanger,2009-01-09 23:39:00,1028,Won't be going .Last time I did I bought a boat ! ( 2006)  really would hate to see what that money would buy in today's market.LOL  TB
290092,irishfield,2009-01-09 23:47:00,26272,LOL Dave... you've got that right and I may get dragged away for assulting Lund reps as well....
290094,danbouck,2009-01-09 23:50:00,4380,I will be going on Saturday. I convinced my wife that I can't buy anything because I bought a new boat last year  She forgot about upgrading
290114,Dave Mercer,2009-01-10 00:46:00,148,I will be there both weekends doing seminars and spending some time in the Yamaha booth. Please make sure to stop by and say hi !  Dave Mercer
290115,Roy,2009-01-10 00:50:00,13728, Hell! That's worth the trip right there! You don't even need to know where the Yamaha booth is. Just stop dead in your tracks as though you were hunting/listening and head in the direction of the infectious laugh.
290240,ohhenrygsr,2009-01-10 04:59:00,947,Go dave and congrats on beating Scott Martin Woot Woot
290264,Stoty,2009-01-10 13:06:00,2910,My dad and I will be there today instead of tomorrow. If you see a young guy with the biggest smile ever....that's me who just spend 1/2 of next years salary on a Bass Boat. HA!

286729,Radnine,2009-01-01 23:01:00,1538," Like I said, it would be something stupid. I am actually after an inflatable life vest so, as I am going anyway I will look for a deal there."
286934,Spiel,2009-01-02 14:58:00,9065, ....I wanted one the first time I laid eyes on it!

286972,Scott S,2009-01-02 16:49:00,203,"I'm looking for a new boat. Sold mine in September. I have been waiting for the boat show, but now I'm a little leary of buying anything the way the economy is right now. I'm hoping the deals are to good to turn down, but I'm not holding my breath Scooter"
286973,Radnine,2009-01-02 17:00:00,1538,"Look for a left-over, new 2008 that the dealer paid 20% less for than he will pay this year. But the boat show is definitely the place to model compare."
286981,Tug Boat,2009-01-02 17:31:00,9,you can buy my boat
286984,Tug Boat,2009-01-02 17:33:00,9,you can buy my boat 18' Lund Mr. Pike

286993,misfish,2009-01-02 17:50:00,29133,"  Never mind the no interest. I want to see if the prices will reflect with todays economy.  The mrs,s and I will be heading down.  Im still looking.   Hey stoty Maybe they will have  the, buy a nitro, and get a tracker for a buck.LOL"
286997,Stoty,2009-01-02 17:54:00,2910,  HA HA HA!  If that's the case......I'll split it with ya!
