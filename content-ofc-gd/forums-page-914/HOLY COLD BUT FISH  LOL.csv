290603,young_one,2009-01-11 03:51:00,620,"Hardcore  -18*C!!! Note to self: Don't follow CC's fishing trends,(January @ss freeze temp & Winter evening fishing) Do stay home and sleep, wait for warmer weekdays!"
290609,douG,2009-01-11 03:56:00,2693,"Just for the Southern contingent, -18C is less than 0F.  A mite chilly dere b'y, for float fishing, I should think, and we have an explanation for the lack of traffic on the trib.  Kudos to the hardcore effort."
