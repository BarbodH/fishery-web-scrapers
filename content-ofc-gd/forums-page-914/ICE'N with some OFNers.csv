Weather was beauty and I was out side most of the day, the bite could of been better but ya take what ya get. Steve (crappieperchhunter) had the hot seat with 2 pickeral, I got a good perch. I had a good time with some great guys and hope to get out with them again.  Steve with #1   Steve with #2   Group photo   Bill."

291382,joonmoon,2009-01-12 19:19:00,528,Good one boyz. I've been checking that place out for a while now on-line. My guess is you would recommend it?
291412,Big Cliff,2009-01-12 20:23:00,6899,"I had a wonderful time and didn't catch a fish (But CPH kindly left me a few for a feed!)   Bill, it was really nice to finally get a chance to fish with you, You'd be welcome in my boat/ice hut/sholder to sholder on the shore..... anytime! Beans and CPH? Well for those two there will never be too many fishing trips with you guys!  I really don't want to do any spaming here but to not share our experience at Leisure Cottages with you would be like trying to keep it a ""Lake X"". Hey, we had a fantastic time with wonderful people but we can't tell you where?  Now one thing about me is I always try to be honest and objective. I loved the location, I was VERY impressed with the owners and the staff, the service was awesome but the first hut Beans and I were in was not well laid out, It was very narrow, the heat source was high on the wall and there was no way to get heat down towards the floor. I am only guessing here but I would guess it might have been 4'X8' at best.  They did move us to a much nicer hut about noon but old farts like Beans (Yah, Yah and me now too) we tend to get stiff and uncomfortable in a small area. The second hut was much more comfortable with lots of room but again I found it awkward to fish, the holes were at the very end of each of the seats, I'm not sure what the perfect layout would be but while the hut and everything was really nice, it was a bit hard to fish (for me anyway).  I would really like to see them invest some money in some well desigined huts and perhaps even an ice bungalow or two. I think that with their setting and their attitude toward customer service they would end up booked full by the first ice every season."
