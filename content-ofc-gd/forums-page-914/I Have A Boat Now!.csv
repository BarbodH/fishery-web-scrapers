290798,tibbs,2009-01-11 17:58:00,650,Nice!  I bet you can't wait to take it out.
290808,Radnine,2009-01-11 18:39:00,1538,Congratulations!! Clean living pays off again! You must be a good guy for someone to give you a boat. Enjoy Jim
290833,profisher25,2009-01-11 20:04:00,185,Nice boat mike!!! Hopefully you can get a trailer for it n then we can go fishing at the BOG!!!
290904,hirk,2009-01-11 22:24:00,571,"Congrates Mike,I may be able to hook you up some,I got a 30lb. Minkota in the box that was a returned x-mas gift,perfect for your new set-up,price would be right."
291157,Mike the Pike,2009-01-12 04:17:00,3421, Hey Cudz is that a Thornes I had one of those used it for a couple of years after I sold my 16 foot fiberglass that is when I realised I want a tiller boat.          Hey Mike congrats on your first boat I had to wait until I was 35 to get my first boat.  Enjoy my friend please be safe and now we expect to see some big ones :Gonefishing
291164,Bly,2009-01-12 04:23:00,1556,"Congratulations!!  I hope you have many hours of fun with it!!  I agree with Wayne...wouldn't paint it, you'll only stress about future scratches etc...besides, it gives it character like the carpet in Cliff and I's boat  hehe"
291166,Mike the Pike,2009-01-12 04:25:00,3421, You know Carole when I get to fish in your boat I will be barefoot
291168,Bly,2009-01-12 04:28:00,1556,  LOL Mike  You are welcome to be barefoot
291193,pikehunter,2009-01-12 10:36:00,1659,"Cartop it home. Get a set of decent roof racks, ropes and tie downs and you'll do OK.  My father used to cartop a 14' Thornes tinny with no trouble. I had a buddy when I was a kid who's father used to cartop a 12' on a VW Beetle all the way up north. 12' boats are usually called cartoppers so don't worry about it, unless of course you're driving one of those ""stupid looking Smartcars!""  Congrats and I wish you many happy fishing trips in you're new boat. Oh yeah, forget the paint, sure it will look nice and pretty all spiffed up but at least using it the way it is a few little dock and rock bumps won't be a worry."
290534,diggyj,2009-01-11 01:53:00,548,"Congrats, hope you land many lunkers in that tinny!"
290574,Zubris21,2009-01-11 02:32:00,563,"You must be pumped!  too bad its just January.   Like others have said I wouldn't worry about the paint, it has more character as it is!  good luck with it, although Im sure you wont need it, based on some of your reports last year!"
290623,DRIFTER_016,2009-01-11 04:29:00,10439,  I used Tremclad aerosol paint to camo up my aluminum canoe 10 years ago and it hasn't fallen off yet.
290624,Cudz,2009-01-11 04:37:00,2652,"Too bad you didn't live near me.  I would lend you my trailer so you could get it home.  That offer stands.  I don't know where up there is but if you are passing through Barrie and you need a trailer, let me know.  You could use the trailer to get your boat home and bring it back to me. If you get it home early enough you can have feb and march to work on it.  Perfect timing if youask me."
290727,MCTFisher9120,2009-01-11 15:30:00,3761,Since it up in Kingston it's going to stay there. I will be able to fish in it this summer for 2 weeks and it will be staying there for another year. Going to be doing come customizations to it then. When i get there on the March break Iâ€™m going to make sure it's a 12' and take a few other measurements and lot's of pictures so i can get the supplies to bring it to life. We have a 40lb Minn Kota trolling motor and i think this will do fine for fishing on a small lake. What i like to do is paddle to my destination and slowly troll and fish on the way back. I wish I had a bigger back yard or I would have it here in Oshawa. I also would like to move that front seat to the middle because there is not much leg room at the bow of the boat.Thanks for the suggestions everybody
290751,nancur373,2009-01-11 16:13:00,1211,Congrats dude. C'mon spring.  Curt
290784,silvio,2009-01-11 17:37:00,433,Hey mike I had a 12 foot tiny as well as my first. I painted mine with tremclad rust paint and had no problems. tape off the bottom non painted section from the top painted section. I have a spray gun so I bought a quart and sprayed it. spray paint will work just as good. thin even coats is key try not to cover everything in one shoot or your just going to end up with a uneven coat and tons of runs. basically mist it on coat by coat let it dry between coats. it take a while but the end result will look good.
