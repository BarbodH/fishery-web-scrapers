Anyhow, we were introduced to a gem of a little lake about 20 kms north of Havelock, Ontario and a first rate operation run by the owners of Leisure Cottages...  This lake is semi private (no public access) except from their property (for a price)...  Huts were $30 per person per day plus $5 doz. for minnows...pretty good if you compare to Simcoe or BOQ...  Mid week and/or weekend packages are available...  That's enough spam for now...  Here is the motley crew from OFC...    From left to right...b2kptbo, Big Cliff, CPH and your truly, Beans  The two pickerel (2 1/2 and 3 pounds) were caught by one member and the perch by another...let's just say it wasn't Cliff nor I...  And a good time was had by all !!!"

291082,crappieperchhunter,2009-01-12 02:25:00,2582,Beauty day out there for sure. Always a pleasure Beansie and Cliff and nice to meet you for the first time Bill. What a gem of a lake. Couldn't have been more then a dozen huts on THE WHOLE LAKE...and no portables ANYWHERE. No sleds roaring around...it was great. Fishing could have been better...but we had a beauty day and the company was 1st rate. I would go back to this place in a heart beat.  Thx guys for a great day on the hardwater.
