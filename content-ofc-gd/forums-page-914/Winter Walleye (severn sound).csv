291486,krawler,2009-01-12 22:38:00,167,"Bought a sled and would like to fish severn sound this year (midland, penetang, HH, waub, hoggs and sturgeon bay, etc).  I know where the pike, perch, herring and lakers are but i know nothing about finding eyes in winter.  If anyone knows this area, they know that there is a lot of structure, varying depths and weeds.  Im not asking for specific locations rather what depths do walleye frequent in the winter, what kind of bottom, rock or weed, drop-offs, flats, points.  Ill be using a variety of baits but for sure jig with minnow and the other swedish pimple or other small flashy spoons.  any help would be great."
