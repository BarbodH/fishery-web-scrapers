289857,Beats,2009-01-09 05:05:00,543,Only thing I've lost down a hole was a few years back sitting in a hut on Simcoe I lost the little metal clip that comes on the OFC blue hand towels.  Replaced it with a small mountain climber type clip.   That's all I have lost but I remember my friend the year before that dropping his forceps down the hole and we watched them do a slow spiral the whole way down til they were out of site )
289944,tnt,2009-01-09 15:54:00,63,"Hey Ron, I remember that story quite well!  I haven't lost anything down the hole as of yet......knock on wood(or Spiel's head)j/k Cuss!"
290282,Rybren,2009-01-10 14:17:00,28,"I remember my Dad losing his glasses in an outhouse.  Had to get his rod (fishing type) out to get them back.  What a funny sight - a 70 plus year old man walking through the campground, rod in hand, heading for the crapper. Lots of people asking what species he was going after and what he was using for bait.  Oops, wrong hole.....  Nothing to report through the ice."
291067,live2fish,2009-01-12 02:15:00,70,oops cell phone went down today....no matter what or where you drop it in the hut it will always finds the hole
291275,Bitsmith2k,2009-01-12 15:14:00,396,sat. morning i was getting into my hut and my full thermos of coffee spontaneously jumped into the hole..
291521,smbhunter,2009-01-12 23:14:00,186,"4 years ago on Lake Nipissing our group lost 2 rods and a tip up down the hole. One rod was mine. I dropped down a williams ice jig to try and get it back, which I thought I did right away, but instead it was my best walleye of the trip. I put the camera down the hole to see if the rod was in the area and the lens was bumping against the reel handle. Managed to get my rod back along with the other rod and the tip up. Last year a friend left his rod in the cup holder of his chair while he came over to talk to me, when a big gust of wind tipped over the empty chair and sent his rod down the hole. He got it back after about an hour, but shortly after that he tried to set hook on a fish, hit the brim of his ballcap and sent a pair of sunglasses about 10 feet into the air and straight down the hole. Never got those back. Today, a buddy of mine tied up a bad boy to his leader and put it in the hole, only to realize that he didn't tie his leader to his mainline."
288505,solopaddler,2009-01-06 19:29:00,8605,"As others have mentioned I've had fish pull rods down the hole and later snagged line and recovered rod/reel and fish. That happened 3 times. The most amazing example occurred a few years back up on Temagami. I drilled a hole at least 1/2km away from where my buddy had his rod pulled down the hole, dropped my jig down and recovered everything including a 9lb laker  .  I've lost cel phones (2), a single burner stove, sunglasses, prescription glasses, chisels, ice scoops, a box of lures (that hurt  ), a whole bunch of rods and tip ups, once a $50 cuban cigar just as I was circumcising it   and countless sundry items like lighters and such.  (I'm like a bull in a china shop in the tight confines of a hut  )"
288552,Pinch,2009-01-06 20:55:00,231,"I almost lost my 4 year old daughter down the hole today on her first ice fishing trip!!!    I had just got into the portable hut and before I could turn around to lift her over and onto her seat, she stepped right into one of the holes!!  One of her legs went into the water all the way up to her hip!!! My wife's not home from work yet, I'm still not quite sure what Im going to tell her!!! lol"
288571,irishfield,2009-01-06 21:33:00,26272, Don't worry.. your daughter will get it all blurted out before you get a chance!!
288576,Clampet,2009-01-06 21:48:00,1947,"From the amount of stuff us fellers have ""lost"" down the hole while fishing, I am beginning to think I could run a successful business salvaging via scuba gear.  There must be a veritable treasure lying on the bottom or our lakes!"
288794,live2fish,2009-01-07 02:48:00,70,2 retainers. 1 Cell 2 pri Bars in the same day but got one back with a big magnet. Lower end of hand auger-got back with a magnet 2 rods this year so far a toonie.
288820,richyb,2009-01-07 03:50:00,774,"On simcoe my dad got an old wood stove on wire line while trolling for trout  , said he figured he had a 30 pounder. Likely from an ice hut."
287873,Spiel,2009-01-05 01:44:00,9065, ...Oh boy I almost remember that one very well.
287874,bigugli,2009-01-05 01:45:00,6138,"One of the guys lost the bottom half of a 2 piece auger. Auger got stuck as he finished the hole, tried to reverse it out and the pin sheared.  Bye bye."
287882,fishnpro,2009-01-05 02:25:00,93,2 years ago I lost a rod to a pike on lake st.john and the same thing happened 2 weeks ago at the exact same spot! Now iv donated 2 rods and reels to the lake.
