Dan and I ended up with 6 lakers a pair of whities and what seemed like a endless number of herring. Dans whitie went 5.5lbs not a bad start. We only fished spoons. The other fellas did well with minnows managing there limits in lakers.    Sun, I met up with Steve Rowbotham and we hit the lake with a few other friends. Started off slow but after fine tuning our location and a few cell phone calls back and forth we found some fish. Everyone managed a couple between 1-3lbs. Hit some nice fish in the 6-8lbs range and a pig that went 12lbs but could have been fatter had she been on the feed!         another great weekend on the water.  Ryan"
