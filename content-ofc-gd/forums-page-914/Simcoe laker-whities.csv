290988,icefisherman,2009-01-12 00:03:00,952,"Started bright and early with Chuck and headed right to the deep....easy walk and we found plenty of ice. Even snowmobiles were running around. It was mainly lakers day....one after another....got 7-8 of them (all released) while trying to get my second whitie....oh well...not complaining as first day on Simcoe for the big boys 2 lakers and a whitie is not bad...Chuck got 2 lakers as well. Meegs and Williams did all the damage. Had great company on the ice and a succesful day...what can one ask for?!? With temps between -20 and -30 next week it should make for a great ice and long ice fishing season  Here is what we've kept:    Cheers, Ice Fisherman"
