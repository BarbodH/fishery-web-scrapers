Lucky to find some fairly fresh holes cause I dodn't change my auger blades    Close to a foot of ice there. Fished for half hour with no luck until a guy by the name of Daniel (future OFC member) came out to where I was. He said I needed to move over about 20-30 feet. He allowed me to use his auger. Dropped a 1/32 yellow jig with a maggot on and fish on about half way down. Then nothing for a while. Daniel was trying out his new Vexilar (sweet) and having pretty good luck. Just as I was about to pack up he let me try his flasher. Literally in 3 seconds fish on. I had to leave after that. Met Daniel on Saturday morning again. The wife and son came out for an hour or so. I got skunked but Daniel and his 2 friends cleaned up 15-20 keepers. Here's a couple of picks. Now I have to start saving for a flasher...lol.      Curt
