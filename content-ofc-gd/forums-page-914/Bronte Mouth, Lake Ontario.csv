I used to fish the mouth in the winter years ago but haven't given it a go for a while now since I started heading to the Niagara area for winter trout.  Anyhoo, have you tried floating for 'em?  There was a group of use that fished the inner harbour and we'd fix our floats so the spawn sacs ran just off the bottom( As I recall, it usually meant suspending the float about 10 or 11 feet up the line ).  Light line and tiny, tiny hooks got us into a few bows.  Goodluck!"
