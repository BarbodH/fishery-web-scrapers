608610,Dabluz,2011-08-02 14:18:00,701,I've got an old Chrysler 9.9 h.p. and the prop seems to be too small.  My Evinrude 7.5 and my Mercury 7.5 both have 3 bladed props of the same size but the Chrysler only has a 2 bladed prop and the blades are smaller than those on the Evinrude or Mercury.  Is this normal?  I'm baffled.
