606602,tight line,2011-07-27 03:41:00,5,Bassive we picked up a couple fish dinners there are selves.Just west of there is where we caught most of are big pike.
608782,Bassive,2011-08-03 00:30:00,58, have a great time...And don't forget the Johnson Silver minnows in Gold and Silver...They were THE lure for our trip. Safe travels! /Bassive
606196,Bassive,2011-07-25 22:03:00,58,"Attached are some pics from our trip up to Eddie North's place, the week of July 9th.  Lot's of great fish and laughs.     Our chariot to the great north!!   Our gear...and beer!!   We drove up on the Friday from Toronto with good time. 1250 KMs in 14 hours (with a few stops along the way) We over nighted at a great Place Lower Twin Lakes Lodge in Nakia. John and family are GREAT hosts with, nice accommodations, great price and roomy cabins. The porta-o-pottys have flowers and reading material for those who like to linger.   Part 1 "
606202,Bassive,2011-07-25 22:11:00,58,"part 2   We got to the Nakina Air and met with our other camp mates. A couple of seasoned fisherman from Ohio.  After our smooth flight in to camp we noticed that Eddie was busy making some great improvements to the camp. The camp now has a cool new set of stair to the water, all hand made. Eddie has been very busy working on camp improvements. Bravo bud, it's looking great! Can't wait for the bowling ally and games room to be complete.. LOL     We also noticed that the water was low, so we hand to adjust our game plan and fishing style after a quick tour around. "
606203,Bassive,2011-07-25 22:14:00,58,Part 3....(this is painful as I can't seem to load these pics on one post...sorry)  The we began to fish....    A cute 36 incher....     Another beauty...  
606204,Bassive,2011-07-25 22:18:00,58,"part 4  And we fished some more........    Great fight with this one, she fought hard.   Yakpiker with a beauty.     "
606206,Bassive,2011-07-25 22:26:00,58,Part 5..  The walleye fishing was GREAT!! The bite was always on and they could be virtually had anywhere there was current. They love a simple jig with a white grub setup that week. No need to get fancy or to break the bank on expensive lures. 1/4 oz jig heads and some grubs lasted the week. The Pike loved Johnson Silver Minnows in Silver and Gold. again...SAVE YOUR CASH FOR MORE FLYIN TRIPS!! ( I've learnt my lesson....)     The shore lunch was great too. I don't eat fish...but I was glad to help add to the fish count for the fry.   
606214,Bassive,2011-07-25 22:39:00,58,The boys did well too.. Here are a few monsters they caught...  Yakpiker.     MK   
606215,Bassive,2011-07-25 22:55:00,58,"more!!  Mick's monster!!!    Another Bassive beauty!!     THE STATS!!  Our boat had..five fish 40 inches plus, and over twenty fish in the 30's. ALL FISH WERE FAT!! They are eating very well at Eddie's. Sun stroke x 2 (DON'T FORGET TO DRINK YOUR WATER and WEAR A HAT!!!)  Over all, at my last count the camp had about 15 fish in the 40's, with the biggest at 45 inters (there were 3-4 caught of that size)  They days were HOT and the fishing was consistent.  Hope you like the pics...Lot's more on my Flickr account...More Bassive pics!!!   Thanks again to my crew, Eddie and James for the TONS of laughs, advice and memories.   cheers!! Bassive  (aka Chef Boyardee )   "

606360,donovac,2011-07-26 14:23:00,11,Thanks for the pics.  We are heading up in 11 days.  Hope they are still biting!
606376,fishnsled,2011-07-26 15:18:00,3520,"Looks like you guys did well!  Too bad about the sun/heat stroke - one of our guys had it as well. Great report!!  Finally got the pics from the last guy in our group, only 35 gigs of picture, video and audio files to go through.  Report to come...."

606470,Bassive,2011-07-26 21:20:00,58,"   CORRECT!! my good man. That was the very spot that supplied the boys with ""lunch"".  "
606474,DRIFTER_016,2011-07-26 21:31:00,10439," I still have to edit video too, but it will have to wait for the fall. Too much to do in our much too short Arctic summer to be messing with videos."

606510,lookinforwalleye,2011-07-26 22:55:00,4399,"Those are some nice gators. I am hoping to do battle with a couple of those myself at Eddie`s other camp in September, but something tells me Richter is going to more of a numbers place than a big pike place. Hope I am wrong!!!"
