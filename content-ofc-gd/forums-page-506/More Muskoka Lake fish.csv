Also got out friday even on Gull hardly any luck though, had a decent largie hit my frog but didn't get a hook set. Saturday we tried new spots on lake Muskoka, we where looking for bass but mostly caught walleye and big ones two, smallest one was 21"" Largest was just over 27"" I also got my largest Pike ever, nothing to barged about but it made me happy.  Bass where not biting very good Saturday Sunday was windy and it was pretty rough but I anchored, it took a few try's and I stayed in one spot almost all day Sunday and caught maybe 30 or 40 bass nothing big though and I lost to many to count as they became rocket ships lol.  I ended up keeping 6 small bass and the smallest walleye everything else I let go. After this weekend I have so far caught 721 fish it been my best year ever.     "

608509,Rod Caster,2011-08-02 01:32:00,5784,"Love the shoulders on those walleye... definitely big fish! That's a good tally, but does that include the minnows used for bait?"
608522,coreyhkh,2011-08-02 01:45:00,163,I don't use minnows. Simple dew worms is all you need for walleye or bass.
