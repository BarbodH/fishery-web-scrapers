You guys pulling anything big out of this creek? I also drove by 14 mile creek the other day. Anyone fished there before?Looks like it could hold some fish, just wondering if anyone on OFC has ever checked it out?"
607680,mark02,2011-07-29 17:20:00,27,"Fish can swim up 16 Mile Creek all the way up to Kelso Conservation Area (Hwy. 401).  The Creek runs through Glenn Abbey Golf Course.  Spring = steelhead, summer = bass, fall = salmon.  There's access at Trafalgar and Dundas, if you want to walk the creek."

608251,dave524,2011-08-01 11:29:00,4508," Think the other side of the lake, 20 Mile is Jordan Harbour, 12 Mile is Port Dalhousie, 14 and 16 are in the vicinity of Charles Daly Park in between, near the exit for 7th Ave Louth on the QEW."
