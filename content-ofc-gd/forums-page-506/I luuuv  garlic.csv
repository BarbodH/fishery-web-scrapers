606558,mercman,2011-07-27 01:06:00,7054,I put that stuff on everything Nice harvest.
606565,lookinforwalleye,2011-07-27 01:17:00,4399,Fish love it too!
606566,Rod Caster,2011-07-27 01:20:00,5784,ahhhhh very jealous here. I'll be sending you a pm the minute I get a yard and a garden.
606601,adolson,2011-07-27 03:36:00,783,I love garlic except when my wife eats it. Argh... Can't they make a garlic that doesn't give you bad breath for a month?
606604,Roy,2011-07-27 04:08:00,13728, I don't think garlic breath is your problem going by your avatar. Just sayin'.
606609,GreenCanada,2011-07-27 04:29:00,375,"Congrats on the bounty! Garlic is one of my favourite ingredients, it goes on everything. Funny thing is my hands never smell after crushing it, nor my breath smell after eating it. I guess I'm a lucky one!!  "
606612,OhioFisherman,2011-07-27 04:59:00,6623,"I worked with a couple of guys that took the garlic pills, for health reasons? On a hot summer day they would reek when they walked by."
606614,adolson,2011-07-27 05:59:00,783," Haha, my breath isn't the problem, my wife's is! Maybe it's payback for the fish..."
606625,NAW,2011-07-27 09:45:00,4022,I haven't read one of your posts in a little while.  Now I'm jelous.  How do you store all of that garlic?  Freezer?
606701,LucG,2011-07-27 14:37:00,779,My father had a pretty large harvest this year as well. Very big cloves!
606725,crappieperchhunter,2011-07-27 15:15:00,2582,Ummmm garlic....love the stuff...now can you cook without it  If you get up this fall for some perching Bruce any chance you could bring me 3-4 bulbs so I can start a little patch this fall. I haven't planted it for years cause it's so cheap to buy...but your haul looks so good...it's got me thinking I might have to try it again.
606766,Rob,2011-07-27 16:46:00,467,Most people don't know but most of the garlic sold in grocery stores is grown in CHINA! That is why I grow my own!  Rob C
606802,bigugli,2011-07-27 18:14:00,6138,"I just keep it in a cool dry place.  You can chop/ crush it, then put it in ice cube trays with a little water and freeze it. You can preserve it in olive oil.  Of the garlic I grow, 1/3 goes to pickles, 1/3 for next year's seed, and 1/3 goes to market."
606805,bigugli,2011-07-27 18:21:00,6138,"The Chinese had a huge crop failure last year. They had buyers here offering over $500 a bushel for quality seed garlic. There is also a huge difference in types of garlic. I only grow hard garlic varieties. They have richer oil, stronger flavour, and a purplish hue to the skin. Chinese garlics are usually soft garlic. Easy to plant mechanically, but the lasting quality is iffy."
606818,335396,2011-07-27 18:55:00,16,will a garlic soaked senko be more attractive or disgusting to fish?
608428,Leecher,2011-08-01 22:47:00,7832,Here's what I do with them.... the pics are gone but recipe is still there:  Garlic recipe  Leechman
608433,vinnimon,2011-08-01 23:08:00,2593,"  Bruce, if you need to get rid of the garlic, stop by I can use some in everything I cook up"
