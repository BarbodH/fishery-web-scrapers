I've never been there before so I was wondering if anyone had some useful information to pass on. Hoping to go for muskie and walleye but will probably fish for bass for a day as well when the muskie and walleye fishing is going slow. Any specific areas or lure combinations that you recommend for this lake? I was thinking orange and black bucktails for muskie as that seems to work well in the rest of the kawarthas. No idea about location though!...or any other lures. Thanks"
