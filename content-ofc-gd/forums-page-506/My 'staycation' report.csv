607832,limeyangler,2011-07-30 05:52:00,5204,"Hi All,  It's been a busy 1st week of our 'staycation'. My in-laws are up (father, sister and brother in law with their daughter).  They have all been up before and my father in law (Dave) and brother in law (Andrew) had said they wanted to fish as often as possible while here...oh....that works!  They arrived last Saturday, unpacked by 7pm and wanted to fish from shore in front of the house right after supper.     JACK WAS KEEN TO SHOW COUSIN LEXI AND GRANDPA HOW IT'S ALL DONE       THEY ALL FISHED HARD     IN THE END GRANDPA WON IT WITH A PIKE  <iframe width=""560"" height=""349"" src=""http://www.youtube.com/embed/0ajAP2q-_w4"" frameborder=""0"" allowfullscreen></iframe>       Sunday was mostly spent organising all our camping stuff for a 2 day stay at the local Provincial Park just 20 minutes up the road, but by 4pm we were all ready to go for Monday so I took the boys out to get some walleye for supper on Wabigoon.       WE FOUND THEM!  <iframe width=""560"" height=""349"" src=""http://www.youtube.com/embed/6bztPiKvrVk"" frameborder=""0"" allowfullscreen></iframe>    NOTHING HUGE, BUT FAST AND FURIOUS ACTION TO WHET THE BOYS APPETITE FOR MORE NW ONTARIO FISHING.           THE BOYS BREATHED IN THE SCENERY ON THE WAY HOME TO A DELICIOUSLY FRESH FISH FRY          The next day we headed to Aaron Park and set up camp for 2 nights. Great park by the way, 2 nights $75 with electric and a lake full of bass, pike, lakers and walleye.     WE WERE WELL ORGANISED AND CAMP WAS UP AND READY IN UNDER 2 HOURS      JACK MADE A NEW FRIEND RIGHT AWAY        JACK WAS ALSO VERY EXCITED ABOUT SLEEPING IN A TENT, AND HE AND LEXI WERE HAVING A BLAST                  WE MANAGED TO GET OUT FOR AN HOUR IN THE BOAT BEFORE SUPPER, THE WIND WAS AT 30+KMH SO TROUT WAS OUT, AND WE ONLY MANAGED A FEW SMALL PIKE AND BASS       <iframe width=""560"" height=""349"" src=""http://www.youtube.com/embed/aca25UKDYzY"" frameborder=""0"" allowfullscreen></iframe>    WAS REALLY NICE CAMPING OUT FOR THE FIRST TIME WITH MY BOY, DOING ALL THE CAMPING STUFF...HE WAS TOTALLY ABSORBED BY THE MARSHMALLOW TOASTING PROCESS....        <iframe width=""425"" height=""349"" src=""http://www.youtube.com/embed/t2zIRCZrhqo"" frameborder=""0"" allowfullscreen></iframe>     I was raring to get on the lake early the next morning...I was up at dawn and Dave only got up because I tripped on a rope holding his tent up. He decided to come with me and try and get a trout or 2 for lunch.....    WHAT A GORGEOUS MORNING, WIND HAD DIED RIGHT OFF FROM THE NIGHT BEFORE                   WE EVEN MANAGED 2 NICE KEEPER LAKERS FOR LUNCH           AFTER A FRESH TROUT BBQ LUNCH WE ALL HEADED OFF FOR A SWIM                           THE EARLY MORNING TROUT SESSION TOOK ITS TOLL ON DAVE       After our swim poor Jack was exhausted...he went down for his 3 hour nap with mum at around 4pm, Dave was sleeping too and the others took off to town, Andrew needed to get some Tylenol or something. Oh dear...what shall I do, everyone is asleep or in town!?....Darned right, I was headed out in the boat!     GOT INTO A NICE TROUT FIRST, RELEASED FOR ANOTHER DAY      THEN FOUND THE WALLEYE, NICE ONES TOO, ALL OVER 18""            <iframe width=""560"" height=""349"" src=""http://www.youtube.com/embed/XRf3W34_o3M"" frameborder=""0"" allowfullscreen></iframe>    AFTER SUPPER WE HEADED OUT FOR A BOAT TRIP WITH THE KIDS               On Wednesday morning we headed home, we spent a good part of the day unpacking and cleaning and by 3pm everyone was asleep. We had a late supper then I took the kids to a small local lake for some perch action...they had been bugging me like crazy all day to go fishing. I think only one perch was caught; the walleye were all over us right under the boat....the kids had a blast!   THE LAKE WAS CALM, THE ONLY WAVES WERE MADE BY OUR BOAT ...PERFECT FOR KIDS.                  <iframe width=""560"" height=""349"" src=""http://www.youtube.com/embed/Njcy7oDq5Rs"" frameborder=""0"" allowfullscreen></iframe>     Thursday morning was an early start. LAC SEUL HERE WE COME! Andrew was really looking forward to this trip as for one reason or another we never made it up there the last time he was here 2 years ago. I really wanted to find and get him into the fish ...and the fishing did not disappoint....really windy day...but plenty of action...and a few 25""ers for Andrew to remember........    ANDREW'S 1ST LAC SEUL WALLEYE...NOT A BAD START!      THE FISHED FLOWED NON STOP ALL DAY                                 <iframe width=""560"" height=""349"" src=""http://www.youtube.com/embed/IzQPWakxiy8"" frameborder=""0"" allowfullscreen></iframe>     Ok...hope some of you made it this far....lol...I know..really long report, but we've been fishing every day except today (Friday) and we still have a week left so I thought I'd better post now.  The in laws are off to Winnipeg tomorrow for an overnight, my wife and child are going on a play date...I'm going to go cast for bass on my home lake first thing in the am...report to follow."
