These mostly related to trout fishing, but from past experience, I knew there were small mouth, which I prefer to fish for.  Anyway, was not disappointed.  Caught several Small Mouth (and lost several Small Mouth, due to lack of a net).  Pretty sure I had 4 pounder on, and at least saw it...but lost it (I know, I know...fish story).  Finally caught a landed a nice 3 pound smallie on the last day (Picture not the best...self portrait   ):    However the reason for the surprise in the title.  Searching for the species on this lake was difficult to say the least.  All I could really find is Lake Trout, different kinds of pan fish, and SM.  On Thursday Night was out fishing, about 100 feet from the dock, when I had a rather larger than expected hit.  It was enough to take out the drag, and my immediate thought.....wow...a large Smallie.  Since we did not have a net, had my fishing partner (and Brother in law) prepped to grab it as I brought it beside the boat.  For some reason though...he didn't want to once he saw it:    Came it at about 3 pounds.  The really funny thing is I caught all my really good fish, in pretty much the same spot. About 100 feet off shore, by the cottage next door's swimming platform.  To this list, I also caught a nice brook trout...unfortunately did not have the camera.  Best cottage/fishing ever.  Considering that it is usually cottaging first...and if I feel like it...fishing second.  One question.  I am wondering if I should let MNR know about the Walleye, as I don't think they have them listed as a species native to either Redstone lake (Hence my surprise)."
608100,mercman,2011-07-31 18:40:00,7054,"Nice report !!! Judging by the size of the walleye, he has been in that lake for a couple of years. Unless there is a river or stream leading into the lake,and he somehow wandered in, you may have a healthy population of them in there. Which would be nice, right?"
608131,singingdog,2011-07-31 20:52:00,1047,Nice size eye there. I have never heard of them being in that lake system. Could be somebody's private stocking program
608152,adolson,2011-07-31 22:26:00,783,"Nice walleye! It looks bigger than 3lbs to me, but I'm not a good judge of weight yet.  The Fish ON-Line site is really inaccurate. They list no smallmouth bass in several lakes in each of which I have caught several smallmouth bass."
608266,Rod Caster,2011-08-01 13:00:00,5784,That walleye is a great catch!!
608270,solopaddler,2011-08-01 13:12:00,8605,"  Wow Adam, you weren't kidding about a surprise! Did you get one that big on the Attawapiskat?   My guess, especially considering you caught a brook trout as well, you stumbled onto a spring hole. Don't tell anyone."
608603,hutch4113,2011-08-02 13:27:00,374," I caught a bigger one up in Attawapiskat.  Doug and I did not weigh it, but think it was 22 inches, and had a pretty good belly.  What really impressed me about this one (Redstone) was the colouring.  The picture does not do it justice...it was a really nice/healthy looking fish."
