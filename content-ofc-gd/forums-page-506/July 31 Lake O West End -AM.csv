Mostly bows and some coho's today....just 4 shakers Kings...ended up 7 for 13....biggest fish was 8 Lbs bow...most fish on the dipsy...both fly and spoon got fish...only few hits on the riggers with spoons...searched for them everywhere...from 50 to 270 fow....very cold...down 40 was 41 -42 degrees.  Anyhow, buddy was happy...here is a shot of him, and few shots of my new planer mast and board (made the boards myself)....I was just testing them today, didn't fish with them....run and pulled very solid, quite happy with them :             Cheers, Ice Fisherman"

608351,Leecher,2011-08-01 20:03:00,7832,Some nice bows Emil   and great DIY work
608384,vinnimon,2011-08-01 21:20:00,2593,Nice Job on the fish and the boards Emile Mind if I ask what wood you used?. Im about to start on my own boards and my mast is 95% complete.
608496,icefisherman,2011-08-02 01:14:00,952,"  Used cedar for mine...came to about $14/board in cedar 1x8 board. All together including all stinless steel hardware came to about $90 for both boards. And the feeling of having made them myself - priceless  Cheers, Ice Fisherman"
