I have been there the last two years and done well on Large Mouth bass each visit.  My gut tells me that there has to be some lake trout or large brook trout in there as one of those lakes is close to 80 feet deep.  I have access to three boats and want to try drop shotting and or slow trolling a three way rig down deep for whatever is living down there.  If anyone knows or has fished these two lakes, I am all ears.  Thanks for any help.   Splashhopper"
