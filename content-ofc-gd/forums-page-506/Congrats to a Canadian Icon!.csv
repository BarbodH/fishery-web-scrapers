Bob Izumi has fished and won numerous Canadian tournaments over the years, but a win down south has eluded him. For his win Bob Izumi will take home a new Ranger boat, motor and trailer package plus over $27,000 in cash. Lets hope this is the start of a string of victories for Bob Izumi this season. Congrats again!  Also congratulations goes out to John McGoey (Omemee) and Cory Johnston (Peterborough) who finished 2nd and 3rd respectively. Normally Canadians do well in these events that border Canada, but I canâ€™t remember them ever doing this good. Sure shows we can Canucks can compete, and not just through the ice.  Tight lines, Andrew"

608222,Grimace,2011-08-01 03:12:00,2020,I have always had a soft spot for Bob. He fished tournaments back when the guys slept in their trucks and he has been loyal to his sponsors forever. The guys that change sponsorship every other year lose credibility when they are shilling you products. Good for Bob for taking his first Yankee tournament.
