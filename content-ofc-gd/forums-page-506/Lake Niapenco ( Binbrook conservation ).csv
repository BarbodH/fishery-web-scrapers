608634,Mike Pike,2011-08-02 15:59:00,1332,"Actually, you have a shot at a little bit of everything there.  Bass, Pike, Crappie, and yes, walleye( although the walleye are still not plentyful despite the effort to re-establish them there ).  Enjoy your day!"
608638,Broker,2011-08-02 16:14:00,482,Thanks ! I'll try jigging off some dropoffs in hopes for some walleye .. Then try for some pike maybe. Won't be keeping anything though.. Apperently it's one of the most contaminated waters in Canada!
608660,Mike Pike,2011-08-02 17:34:00,1332,"And don't ignore targeting the bass.  Ya, I believe you're not to keep fish from there as they're try to improve sport fishing at the lake.  With the recent discovery of a previously untested for contaminant, they probably won't have to worry about folks keeping their catch now.  Still a good spot to wet a line, imho."
608775,smally21,2011-08-03 00:18:00,993,"lots of crappie, and max. depth of 28'. I think its the best conservation fishing in the area, such as it is. and a good canoe spot as well"
608779,Broker,2011-08-03 00:25:00,482,"Anyone tried getting walleye , any luck?"
608796,fishing,2011-08-03 01:01:00,167,Lots of crappies there and most people target them. People do not normally target walleye because there is not much of it.
608800,Broker,2011-08-03 01:06:00,482,"Thanks , i might Jig abit just to see what happens, but for the rest of the time ill try for some crappie and bass!"
