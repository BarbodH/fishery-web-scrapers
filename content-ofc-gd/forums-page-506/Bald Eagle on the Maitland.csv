608313,HTHM,2011-08-01 17:52:00,4082,"I see a pair of them out there all the time, they seem to be in area of the airport mostly. Pretty majestic, eh?"
608315,Live2fish85,2011-08-01 17:57:00,1633,There amazing my parents watchede one go after a duck off the point in the bay at there place. I have seen them along the shores a fair amount and if you go to ontario power by Port Dover in the late year you can see them a fair amount they always feed down by the warm water outlet. It's really cool seeing them there sometime there a few of them at a time.
