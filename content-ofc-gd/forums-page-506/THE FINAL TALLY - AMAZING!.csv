606457,The Urban Fisherman,2011-07-26 20:40:00,2050," Thank you very much for the words Charles... and thanks again for the awesome prizes! We had an amazing group of people working together to make this happen and they all deserve a huge round of applause.  For those who didn't see the two big fish, adult and kids division in Juli's post... here they are again... this is a fishing forum after all!  13.25 inch  Bullhead won biggest kids div.   Here he is holding up his check! ( a 5 lb chocolate bar ) lol   And here's Brian Beaumont's 22 inch largie... skinny fish but long with a huge head...   Thanks again everyone - until next year!"
606464,asdve23rveavwa,2011-07-26 21:09:00,2690,"Just wanted to give one last huge thank you to all the sponsors!!!!  Don't think it was mentioned yet in any of these posts, but, Dave Mercer donated an amazing tackle package this year that included a Shimano Calais, that, I know one lady is very proud to own!!  Ask her next time you are at Dixie Tackle Hope we all did you proud, and, that eventually we can beat this disease!"
606502,The Urban Fisherman,2011-07-26 22:45:00,2050, He also provided is with all of the shirts we were wearing!
606506,solopaddler,2011-07-26 22:49:00,8605,Ryan that is truly remarkable.  What you've accomplished here is inspiring.
606507,SRT8 smoker craft,2011-07-26 22:51:00,1107,Yeah that signed Calais will be proudly displayed at the shop I'm sure Laurie looked like a little kid on X-mas morning with that reel and tackle pack in hand .I took a bunch of pics but haven't had time to get them uploaded yet I will post them once I do.

606385,charlesn,2011-07-26 15:53:00,551,Thanks to all of you who put in the work to help raise awareness for the fight against this terrible disease and also help to raise angling awareness and show the compassion and good heartedness in the angling community as a whole.  Lots of negative things make news - so it is very heartening to see something positive also make the news and be a big deal.  Good on ya all.
