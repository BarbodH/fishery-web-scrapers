607810,Joeytier,2011-07-30 02:08:00,3990,After a generous application of sunscreen I was out the door...the truck thermometer read 42 at one point...  Contacted an old buddy and got out for a few hours this evening on the mighty Ott...as usual it did not dissapoint...  Hit up a small stream on the way to try for some specks...I managed 3 of these little beauties...not bad for late July...   Before the evening came about we managed 3 chunky smallmouth and a 10 lb pike...all of which managed to come off before coming ashore...  But these things happen...It was steady action at least.  Finally just prior to a massive thunderstorm rolling in for the evening my buddy manages a tasting looking sauger...   Love the spotted dorsal...   And just prior to being blown away by gale force winds and a torrential downpour...I add to the stringer with a nice little walter...   A day off well spent...

608028,Joeytier,2011-07-31 11:03:00,3990,I would've taken some if I had my SLR with me.  It's a little uh...waterlogged.  A month after the warranty expired no less...

I've caught a speck that was covered with black spots.... it covered the whole fish... discusting to say the least... got her back in the water pronto
