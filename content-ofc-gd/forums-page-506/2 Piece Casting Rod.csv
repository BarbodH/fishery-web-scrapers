606696,4x4bassin,2011-07-27 14:32:00,1025,"I'm looking for a good/decent 2 piece casting rod that I can take on my atv trips , I have one piece rods but they are too awkward to travel with on the atv . I don't want to spend to much since it is going to be traveling around on the atv getting beat up, say around $75.00 . Any suggestions"
606714,Spiel,2011-07-27 15:05:00,9065,"I picked up a Shimano ""Bob Izumi"" signatures series years ago at CTC. Two piece 6' 8"" casting, rated for 10 to 20 for around 69.99 plus tax. It's been a fairly decent rod for the money and I have abused it heavily. Pretty sure they still carry them."
606732,LucG,2011-07-27 15:24:00,779,I bought a 2 piece casting Shimano Voltaeus (spelling??) at CTC for under $70. I believe they have several diff models available.
606735,NAW,2011-07-27 15:28:00,4022,My fishing buddy grabbed a Rapala one.  I've used it a few times and was impressed.  I was on the market for a 2 peace casting rod a while back.  Nearly bought a Fenwick 2 peace.  Very nice looking rods IMO.  Ended up having one given to me for free.
606738,lookinforwalleye,2011-07-27 15:34:00,4399,"Ditto on what Chris said, I have a couple of the Bob Izumi signiture rods the older version blue ones 2 piece and they are super rods. I have had them for about 10 years now and they are still going strong and they will be making the trip to Ricther lake in a few weeks as well."
606746,4x4bassin,2011-07-27 15:54:00,1025,"This is pretty funny because I had the same Bob Izumi rod you guys are talking about and just broke it on my last trip, this thing was tough as nails but it couldn't handle an atv roll over (tough trail) I have looked for the same rod at a couple CT stores in the area with no luck ! Thanks"
606759,lookinforwalleye,2011-07-27 16:15:00,4399,Some rods are tougher than others obviously.My medium heavys are almost bullet proof but the medium fast action 7' Compre that I am wrapping and sending back to Shimano today broke putting it into a rod case.  Never got the bloody thing wet!!!
606760,cuzza,2011-07-27 16:18:00,467,I've got an Izumi rod and it's great - not the casting model though.  4x4Bassin - they were on special again last week so maybe they're low on stock after that but according to the website my local store (Oakville) has all the models in.
606761,mercman,2011-07-27 16:20:00,7054,I just picked up 2 Abu Vendetta 7' AT SAIL. REGULAR 79.95 FOR 54.95  
606970,spincast,2011-07-27 22:59:00,3279,"Ugly Stick? Not real finesse, but it'll take alickin' . I bought the Izumi last year - broke on a  heavy weed snag on about the 10th cast . Got a replacement (with the help of Vinnimon- thanks )but not the Izumi.. Based on where it broke and the warranty coverage  I figure it had a manufacturing flaw. I bought another one last week when they were on sale - hopefully this one will last longer. Find out in 24 hours I guess.  "
606973,GoneFishin,2011-07-27 23:06:00,349,I picked up a compre for for under 60 on sale not sure if you'll be able to find one though. I also have a bob izumi and for a 2 piece rod (and the price range) it's actually quite nice.
607201,4x4bassin,2011-07-28 15:11:00,1025,"Thanks guys , i'm going to check out a couple more CT's and yes maybe I can't find them because they were on sale last week and are out of stock , Figures !!!!!"
607988,gogu392,2011-07-31 02:05:00,142,"Hi There, I have a Fenwick (two pieces) baitcast MHXT /8'6"" / 8-12lb, 3/8..3/4oz/ for sale. The rod was used few times and was not abused. Since I got a Dodge Caravan I use only one piece rods. Let me know."
608012,Live2fish85,2011-07-31 04:07:00,1633,"Hey sory to post off of your post 4x4 but I figured it would be better then starting a new topic on something so similar. I am taking a trip up north in mid Aug. We are going to be taking the ATV a couples miles in to a lake and then portaging in a few more lakes. I am looking at getting a 2 piece spinning rod, I don't want to bring any of my other rods as they are all 1 piece and don't want to chance breaking them. I was looking at the St. Croix Triumph or I also noticed the XPS Bionic Blade was on sale any buddy got any opinions on these rods. I own a few higher end St. Croixs and love them but thought I'd see if anyone has used the Bionic Blade spinning rods.  Thanks Chris  Sorry again 4x4 just don't need another post on the same topic."
608174,GoneFishin,2011-08-01 00:32:00,349,Gagnon sports has a sale coming up and you'll be able to choose from a couple rods on sales but they do have a 2 piece compre for 50 bucks
608805,Fishingelbow,2011-08-03 01:11:00,2,"But not a 2-piece rod, is it?  ><(((Â°>"
