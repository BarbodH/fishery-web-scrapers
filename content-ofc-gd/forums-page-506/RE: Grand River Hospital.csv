It was a good break for the O'Shea's to get away from the hospital while they were there.  And even though I don't know you I'm willing to offer my time to help you escape from what you are going through and talk fishing or anything else you want to talk about.  I'm at the Bay and Richmond area so if you are close let me know.  Next week I'm not downtown so we would have to work someting out later on if you like.  PM me if interested.  I'm sure I can find an 'ugly shirt' for you some where too.  Be strong and think of the good things to come, cheers.  Geoff  *edit*  man o man I'm having a heck of a day for the past 2 days...
