607054,adolson,2011-07-28 02:16:00,783,"Ahhh, I just thought of a great fishing moment!  I went to go ice fishing with my uncle, stepdad, and one of my brothers. He was just a little kid at the time, and hyper (ADHD or something). Anyhow, we had no luck on a lake so we went to a trout farm. My brother caught one, and got super excited and was jumping up and down. I was video-taping this, by the way. My stepdad goes, ""be careful! you're going to step in one of the holes!"" and my brother is backing up yelling, ""I got a fish! I got a fish!"" when, bloop! Leg right into one of the holes. We did laugh. He did cry. Good times."

607078,Rod Caster,2011-07-28 03:30:00,5784,"wow, great stories everyone!  Mine is a numbers day. In northern Alberta, me and a pal took off work and fished with home-made lures. Over a dozen Pike over 15lbs and uncountable walleye. The bar was set! Biggest pike I've ever seen!  "
607088,Live2fish85,2011-07-28 04:07:00,1633,I have plenty of great memories of fishing but by far the memories that stand out the most and make me realize why I love fishing as much as I do is because of my grandfather. I remember going to the cottage in Port Dover and we would get up at 5 and go get worms and then out in the boat we would go to get lots of perch. Always stayed with me and I am glad it did.
607091,adolson,2011-07-28 04:15:00,783," I'll have to ask my mom if she still has it.. This was many years ago. I do recall talk of sending it into America's Funniest Home Videos, but I don't think it ever got sent. It was pretty funny, except for the fact that right as his leg was fully submerged I hit stop - I wasn't expecting it and was already in motion to stop recording. I hit record again as soon as I could, so it kinda cut from leg down the hole, to him bawling his eyes out. If she has it still, I have a capture card and a VCR, so I could get it onto YouTube.  I'll email her and find out."
607187,Beans,2011-07-28 14:45:00,3339,"When I was a young lad and school was out for the summer, I was sent to the farm to help out my grampa and his sister (him in his seventies and her in her eighties)...  The odd weekend my grampa and I headed up to Cesarea to stay at  my uncle's cottage and I caught my first big bass...  The part I remember the best is when we got back to the farm and showing the fish to my great-aunt...""Oh"" she said ""did your grandfather catch that?""...  I touched her arm (she was hard of hearing and used a ""trumpet"" to hear better) to get her to look at me and I shook my head and pointed to my chest and mouthed ""ME""  ""Oh My!"" she exclaimed and her eyes lit up bright as can be...  Ain't memories great ?...I just relived that moment..."
607189,Squid,2011-07-28 14:50:00,1656,"My favorite moment came when a friend of mine was fishing with me for walleyes up north, He hooked into what he thought was a huge walleye which ended up being a 14 inch FAT perch. He grabbed the fish and showed it to me and said ""look at the size of this perch, its HUGE!"" I agreed and he turned the fish towards him belly facing and the perch proceeded to milk him in the face the mouth and down his shirt. He screamed and at this point I was on the floor of my boat holding my stomach from   laughing so hard. He then asks me if there is any ""stuff"" left on his face or around his mouth!!!   Has to be the funniest moment of my life while fishing."

606782,mike rousseau,2011-07-27 17:25:00,4661,"Hey  Wondering what some of your favorite fishing memories are... Whether it was a day filled with fish or special moments...  For me... A couple come to mind...  My wife's big musky... We were live bait fishing and she got a bite... So I told her to feed him line... Then I asked if she wanted me to set the hook for her... NO!!!! She said... I wanna do it myself... She set and the battle was on... I could tell it was big... Then she got it boatside and her face went a bit pale... It was 48 inches at least... Then it decided to fight and marissa ended up hunched over the side of the boat saying ""I can't do it... I can't do it..."". So I asked if she wanted me to take the rod...""No... ITS MY FISH"" she yelled back... At this point I'm laughing at her behavior... Then we finally landed the beast.... We both had big smiles... Then I told her a lot of people never get a Muskie that big... She was proud of her fish and so was I...  These are the types of days that I remember...  How about you?"

My first Skamania rainbow trout in 97...still my biggest ever bow at 17 lbs.  Seeing that thing fly out of the water as high as it did was amazing.  Watching Juli catch her first 20 + lb King on Lloyd's boat last summer.  Ask him, Vinnimon or Spincast about that one!  We were laughing watching that show, not too mention her comments during the battle!!  My musky while wading moment at Restoule last summer.  Seeing that big toothy creature coming straight for my bare legs, than turning to nail my buzzbait got my heart pumping like you wouldn't believe!!!

606794,Gregoire,2011-07-27 17:49:00,1397,"A few highlights, Last year catching my first Musky, a skinny 43 incher Yesterday catching my first Steelhead, ad hooking into my first Salmon Fishing in Lake superior provincial park a few weeks ago Last year landing a 40 inch plus Pike at the Toronto Islands A few years ago experiencing consecutive days of amazing Smallmouth action at Lake Memphremagog in Quebec 5 Years ago My uncle taking my brother and I into the backcountry of Nova Scotia chasing Brookies 15 years ago my uncle doing the same with just me 10 years ago my Dad taking me on a fishing trip for Walleye and Pike as a graduation present to the near north in Quebec As a 5 year old catching a dozen perch one day at our cottage on Hamilton Island  But the highlight is this: My grandfather taught me how to fish as a young boy. My mom is from Nova Scotia, and she used to pack up my brother and I for a month to head home each summer. When I got there my grandfather would always take me fishing. Unfortunately my grandfather passed away on a fishing trip when I was about 5. After that I never had anyone to really take me fishing while in Nova Scotia. I used to got to the wharf at the end of the cape and once caught a whole mess of smelt. My Uncle would take the to stocked fish and pay ponds every now and then, but no one would really take my. One day when I was about 16 my great uncle came up from New Brunswick to visit for a few days. He and my grandfather were best friends, and great fishing buddies. He was on the fishing trip with my grandfather when my granpy drowned. The boat had flipped, and of course none of them were wearing life jackets. My uncle looked back to see if my granpy was ok, and seeing that he was swimming with a paddle started swimming to shore. When he looked back again my granpy was gone. One of the reasons my great uncle came up was to take me fishing. He showed me all the old fishing holes that he and my granpy used to go to. All the streams, and the roads they took to get to them. He showed my how to fish for them. He was getting on in age, and had to use a walking stick to get around, so walking all those streams with me must have been very hard for him, but he stuck with it. I couldn't help but feel that he thought it was his duty to show me these fishing spots, as my granpy was not around to do it. I think I will always keep this as my top fishing memory of all time. For me this is what fishing is all about. Taking the time to go out with people and teaching were to go and what to do in order to be successful. For me this was almost a religious experience.   Thanks for reading, and thanks for starting the topic Musky Mike."

Mepps spinner with a rubber minnow ... on the rod and leaned it in the corner.  I went out musky fishing very early the next morning and left the wife asleep. She got up about 6:00 AM and thought it would be nice if she could go down to the dock and catch a pickeral for us for breakfast. She still had the Mepps clipped on and on her very 2nd cast she hooked into her 1st ever musky, a very nice 43 incher  She'd never caught a big fish before but remembered what I'd taught her about adjusting the drag and fighting the fish. She did a great job of getting it into the beach but then was afraid to take the hooks out with it jumping around. She had to leave it on the ground while she ran to the neighbors trailer and woke him up to come and help her.  Unfortunately it died before they could release it and she felt terrible  Good thing though is we had a friend who was a taxidermist over in Havelock and he mounted it for her and she still has it and still to this day tells the story to anyone who'll listen to her  I was a couple miles away when it happened but to this day it's still my favorite fishing moment"
606864,fishnsled,2011-07-27 20:04:00,3520,"As kids, my Dad took my brother and I to a pier for some perch fishing. Well the perch were few and far between but the bass were jumping on are lines all day long and keeping us entertained.  We were asking Dad if we could keep some for dinner and he told us no as they were not in season and had to be released. When we got home, he got out the regs (trying to instill some wisdom I guess) and read to us that bass season had opened that very day. We always have read the regs since then.  First 10 pound + eye caught with Headhunter.  First musky over 20 pounds.  Biggest bass - just shy of 6 pounds  Biggest pike at 43.5 inches.  Arctic Grayling fishing in the NWT.  So many to have just one but will end with this one.  Last Sunday we were going through Dad's stuff. When it came time to decided what to do with his tackle, both my brother and I figured we had enough and picked out something small. The rest of his tackle which included a bunch of rods and reels, rod stand, several tackle trays and tackle bag, bags of plastics, ice fishing gear including a manual auger (used maybe once or twice as we always used my gas auger when we went out), and sleigh as well as a portable fish finder - we gave it all to Dad's step grandson. He was hoping for a couple of things and he could not believe his ears. Just like a kid on Christmas morning going through all the stuff, stripping old line of the reels and grinning ear to ear the whole time. A sight that I will never forget and one that Dad would have loved to have seen, something tells me he did."

606921,splashhopper,2011-07-27 21:21:00,2931,my most memorable fishing experience was the first time I took my daughter fishing with me.  I had no idea if she would like it or if she would get bored so I took her to a good spot for carp.  We went to Walmart and bought one of those $15.00 reel and rod combo's for her and headed out.  Got to the spot.... not there 5 minutes and she hooks in to a MONSTER carp !  She had a wrist brace on her hand and was fighting this fish like the trooper she is.  I stuck real close to her as she only weighed 45-50 lbs then and that fish was pulling her like she was wasn't even there.  Then she yelled at me to take the rod because it was hurting her wrist and she didn;t want to lose it.  Yeah no pressure chanelle.... a five foot rod and not even sure how much line or what lb test was on the real.  About 10 minutes later we got it in...   She couldn't even lift it....  Turns out it was about 30lbs.... the following picture doesn't do the fish justice ( it's gurth was double what you see there).... but her smile says it all..... Her FIRST FISH !      Great topic.
