607637,cynmar,2011-07-29 15:30:00,169,"Well my little Korean, Canadian tire 7bearing spinning reel has finally bit the dust after 6 years. I am looking for a small spinning reel for use with my light action Daiwa rod that I use for perch. Even though light action , this rod has landed a 41"" Northern with this little reel. I have a Pfleuger President but at around 11 oz. it is way to heavy for this set up. Any suggestions, looking at not much over $100.00 so lower end Shimano , or Pflueger or other. I'm not brand dominated, just want a relatively good, long lasting reel.  (And it's 6' rod not 6"" , Bill you dummy)  Bill"
607638,BillM,2011-07-29 15:37:00,17367,I just picked up a Shimano Saros 1000F for my oldman because he liked using mine so much.  750 body size with the 1000 sized spool.  Absolutely love it.  Use it for everything from specs to walleyes.
607640,GBW,2011-07-29 15:39:00,8460,a sienna 1000 is more then enough for perch and it's about $40?
607644,asdve23rveavwa,2011-07-29 15:46:00,2690,"Love Bill's choice!  But, I hate to say it, I agree with Geoff If it is mostly being used strictly for perch, no need to shell out too much money."
607646,GBW,2011-07-29 15:51:00,8460,hey now...      hahaha
607647,BillM,2011-07-29 15:53:00,17367,"Yeah, the Saros isn't exactly cheap.  Sienna or even the Sahara would be a great choice."
607649,bushart,2011-07-29 15:56:00,2628,Ok Gray Whiskers talkin here to save Ya'll headaches down road from my vast experience  Spinning Reels---Shimano  Spinning Rods----St Croix  Finders---------Lowrance  Boats----------Tiller  Salmon Bait-----Stay Pufts  Ok the last 2 are debatable
607652,asdve23rveavwa,2011-07-29 16:00:00,2690,  Okay that's two days in a row that I almost spewed liquid out of my nose reading replies
607676,mark02,2011-07-29 17:09:00,27,Go with the Daiwa Whisker SS 700.  They are under $100.  Bullet proof.
607693,Live2fish85,2011-07-29 18:00:00,1633,What size President do you own they have a few different sizes I'm sure the 6725 would work just fine.
608179,cynmar,2011-08-01 01:05:00,169," I've got the 6735, find it a bit heavy.  Bill"
608180,atvaholic,2011-08-01 01:12:00,271,"I really like my Pflueger Supreme. Nice and lite, solid reel too."
608184,uglyfish,2011-08-01 01:23:00,981,"theres a quantum energy pti 10 for sale in the classifieds i just seen. that would be the perfect reel for u. its a small sized reel, very reliable, light weight."
608267,cynmar,2011-08-01 13:07:00,169,"Thanks for the input guys, I saw the Quantum in the classifieds, didn't know how heavy it was, going to check it out as well as the other suggestions. Great help.    Bill"
608275,Gregoire,2011-08-01 13:58:00,1397,Check out the tiny lite from basspro as well if all you are looking for is a lightweight reel.
608284,Live2fish85,2011-08-01 14:57:00,1633," I know what you mean it's not that light I own the 35 as well but I know the 25 isn't to heavy something to look at. I love pflueger reels, by far my favorite for spinning reels."
