Headed to a lake I have only fished once so we tried the end we have not fished.  Nothing spectacular largest was around 3 lbs. I really need to figure out how to hook my fishfinder up to my tinny as I know they are in the lake just not too many along shore on this day.  Saw the craziest thing, a sunfish somehow wedged itself between my brother's Senko and the hook of an EWG hook. I don't think I will ever see this again.          "
