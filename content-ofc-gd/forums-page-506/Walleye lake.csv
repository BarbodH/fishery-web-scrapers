608192,kuhaman,2011-08-01 01:38:00,503,Try google
608193,irishfield,2011-08-01 01:39:00,26272,Grab a map and throw a dart ! It's how I choose my lakes to fly into !
608203,ehg,2011-08-01 02:05:00,2666,Maybe mention a town near where you live and someone might mention a decent lake nearby. Central Ontario covers a lot of area but walleye are found in most places.
