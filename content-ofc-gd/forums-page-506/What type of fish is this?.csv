608328,limeyangler,2011-08-01 18:40:00,5204,"Hi all,  I have found these guys under rocks in Lake wabigoon in front of our house. I know what a Goby looks like....in England they are also known as blennies (sea version) and this is definitely one.  I spoke to an MNR guy a couple of years ago about them, he said he did not think that ""Round Gobies"" had made it into the lakes up here, and was i sure what i had been finding were gobies.  I am 99.9% sure it is a goby...but not sure if it is a native or invasive species. Either way i will be calling the nice Biologist lady at the MNR here in town and forwarding the pics and video...just thought i'd see what you good folks think.   So...my questions for you all are  1) Is it a goby?  2) If it is, is it invasive or native?   Thanks.    GOBY?  <iframe width=""560"" height=""349"" src=""http://www.youtube.com/embed/VZamkNz8G4w"" frameborder=""0"" allowfullscreen></iframe>                    "

608330,mercman,2011-08-01 18:47:00,7054,http://www.scienceda...70905150406.htm  This is what i occasionally catch here in the St Lawerence. Yours looks slightly different though.
608332,irishfield,2011-08-01 18:49:00,26272,In Paul's link.. see how the Goby has a forward facing mouth... the Sculpin is down similar to a sucker and similar to what you have posted Simon.
608333,Fisherman,2011-08-01 18:50:00,7201,"What Wayne said, Round Gobys have the front pelvic fins fused together, I see a distinct split on the picture shown upside down."

608335,limeyangler,2011-08-01 18:56:00,5204,"hi folks, absolutely what wayne and fisherman said.....Sculpin.             "
608338,Roy,2011-08-01 19:05:00,13728,"Can't see the fins on yours very well, Simon. It appears to be a sculpin though. Here's a drawing that'll help identify any others you might come across. And thanks Jack for keeping an eye on invasive species for us. "
608341,Fisherman,2011-08-01 19:10:00,7201,Roy..it's either type faster or get a faster internet connection..
608342,Rod Caster,2011-08-01 19:12:00,5784,"X 5 on sculpin, we catch them smelting all the time"
608343,Roy,2011-08-01 19:18:00,13728,"  Sorry Bud, I had to save 2 orphans and a nun from a burning house while you were posting."

608361,Spiel,2011-08-01 20:37:00,9065,"Did anyone say Sculpin, cause I am."
608370,Bill Shearer,2011-08-01 20:56:00,456,"Chris is totally correct, as always! Damn Goby's get blamed for lots of stuff, but this time they are innocent. At least IMO"
608372,Roy,2011-08-01 21:07:00,13728,That's a defused sculpin.
608382,Spiel,2011-08-01 21:16:00,9065,"   LOL, others beat me to it Bill but it is what it is.  "
608385,Roy,2011-08-01 21:21:00,13728,Gobies all over the Great Lakes are getting their pelvic fins clipped and going on to lead normal lives. All they have to do now is change their accent.
608387,Spiel,2011-08-01 21:22:00,9065, Would a French accent suffice outside of La Belle Province?   
608388,irishfield,2011-08-01 21:23:00,26272,I can see the next Dock cartoon now....

608414,Leecher,2011-08-01 22:17:00,7832," Don't you be making fun of us now   Our accent is just ""normale"" to many of us ya know"
