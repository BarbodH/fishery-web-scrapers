924325,manitoubass2,2015-07-11 20:03:00,11391,"Tell us all the story and let us be judge, jury and prosecutioner???  In all seriousness I have no clue?  Can you even block members on OFC?"
924326,HTHM,2015-07-11 20:06:00,4082,"Last time I did that I ended up on mod-que. Apparently you can, it says so in the help files, I just cannot find the right settings as of yet."

924440,Steelheadphycho,2015-07-12 14:01:00,470, What a shame....... Sorry you have to go through that crap!
924461,Roy,2015-07-12 17:07:00,13728,"What a shame....... Sorry you have to go through that crap!  I think that most people are sorry that both dudes have to go through that ""crap"". The problem with trying to settle things on fishing forum is that most people don't come here for that kind of ""crap"". You're adults, settle your ""crap"" by PM, email, phone or better still, in person. You both still have your PM privileges and I'm quite sure you know each others phone numbers/personal addresses. Git 'er done. You'll both sleep better."
