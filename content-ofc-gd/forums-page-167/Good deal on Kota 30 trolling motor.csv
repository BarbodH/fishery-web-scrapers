923801,Mattones,2015-07-08 01:08:00,587,Hey everyone! I haven't posted in a few years but recently picked up fishing again.  I found a sweet deal on a KOTA 30 at TSC.  They are 60% off making the trolling motor $99! canadiantire sells them motor for around $150  I picked one up from TSC grimsby today and it actually rang in at $73!!  If you want an even better deal price match it at canadiantire and get 10% back in CT money. http://www.tscstores.com/MINN-KOTA-ENDURA-C2-30LB-THRUST-TROLLING-MOTOR-P32105.aspx#.VZx3AXD3aK0
