923811,Lunkerhunter,2015-07-08 01:51:00,455,Hey everyone. I am looking to buy a new handheld GPS. I am looking to see what everyone recommends. I will be using it for fishing mostly so I was thinking maybe a garmin as they have the inland lake maps for ontario.  Anybody have any feedback on the units you guys are using. Any info is much appreciated.

I use it mainly for hunting and it works great, is super easy to use and is touch screen.  I do take it in the boat as a backup pretty often.  I managed to snag one of those navionics beta test chips for garmin, and it's pretty cool cause I have maps loaded onto the GPS, but I can switch between them and the navionics chip.  It's not what I'd want for my main navigation screen though.  I'd try to go a size up in screen if the budget allows."

924008,singingdog,2015-07-09 10:23:00,1047,The 62 series from Garmin are great units: super accurate in a wide range of conditions. I have had mixed results with touch screens on handheld GPS.
