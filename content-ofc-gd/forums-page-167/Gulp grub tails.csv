923643,captpierre,2015-07-07 11:57:00,2521,So you place a sliding egg sinker 18-20 inches ahead of the harness protecting the swivel/knot by a bead? I guess a bullet sinker might shead some weeds. For sure I'll try this. Then a bottom bouncer for deeper trolling. Always troll near weeds or are weedless flats ever productive?
923644,porkpie,2015-07-07 12:04:00,2521,sand bottom flats with consistent depth can be very productive depending on time of day.
923651,captpierre,2015-07-07 12:28:00,2521,Thanks Porkpie. You've been very helpful too.
923652,captpierre,2015-07-07 12:31:00,2521,I was actually pleased that the pannies where agressively going after the Gulp grub. Way more nibbles than off a normal plastic grub. Must be a good bait. Will try them on a harness too.
923655,doubleheader,2015-07-07 12:48:00,497,"As a general rule of thumb plastic or artificial grubs and crawlers work best when triggering a reaction strike. Reaction strikes are triggered when conditions force the target species to commit before testing. In other words, they get one chance for the meal. Typically this will occur where there is current, weeds, or when the presentation is moving at a fairly rapid pace. Put another way, live bait will almost always out fish artificial if one is trolling a harness on the bottom of an open body of water at 1 mph or less. In the absence of weeds or current for walleye the pendulum of live bait to artificial swings from moderate to convincing in favor of live bait until the presentation speed picks up to over 1.3 mph.  At that point it may level out some, especially if nuisance fish are constantly robbing you."
923657,Sinker,2015-07-07 12:56:00,8692,Those flats are killer on cloudy days!  S.
923809,smitty55,2015-07-08 01:39:00,928,"FYI here is an interesting study done by Carleton University on soft plastic lures. http://www.fecpl.ca/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/Raison-et-al-2014_Water-A-S-Poll.pdf  Then I read this on page 9 from that CU report. ""Interestingly,the Berkley Gulp! ALIVE! worm, which is advertised as a biodegradable bait (http://www.berkley-fishing.com/products/soft-bait/gulp), only reduced slightly in size during the experiments"" I think the operative word there is advertised. Are they really as biodegradable as they say? I'm not sure of the time frame in the CU study, but some of them were two years long.  Cheers"
923810,manitoubass2,2015-07-08 01:43:00,11391,Ive never kept a fish and it had plastics in the belly.  Two years ago however I caught a small walleye and it had 3 jigs in its belly
923873,landry,2015-07-08 12:52:00,1005,I love to jig but those darn worm harnesses are hard to beat along a weed edge in the Kawarthas or Haliburton.
923892,Sinker,2015-07-08 15:36:00,8692,"Same here. I""d rather jig or jerk some husky jerks, but if that fails, the ole harnesses get wet. They always produce something....  S."
923895,manitoubass2,2015-07-08 16:00:00,11391,"I hardly fish harnesses on most lakes, and its actually pretty stupid.  I dont think one rig produces better or more catches of most inland species then the harness.  I dont like trolling so thats apart of it. But once i found a way to cast harnesses i spent alot more time using them."
923972,fishindevil,2015-07-08 23:29:00,6254,It's true there isn't much you cannot catch with a worm harness !!! I have already caught a lake trout this spring while fishing for walleye in Haliburton on a harness !!!! Muskies especially love them as do pike ...
923973,manitoubass2,2015-07-08 23:33:00,11391,"Try using single hooks with 2""power minnows for crappie, its unreal.  Id even say better then a bobber and a minnow"
923429,captpierre,2015-07-06 02:32:00,2521,So the walleye fishing on North Pigeon is tough for me. Was way better last year. I don't use minnows. Tried Gulp 3 inch grubs for the first time. Kept getting the tails bit off. Likely from panfish. Anybody have any  tips how to minimize this?
923439,mike rousseau,2015-07-06 04:41:00,4661,"Smaller grubs  I've had that happpen with 4"" grubs... Downsized to 3"" and bingo!"
923448,PUMP KNOWS,2015-07-06 13:17:00,937,I hate it when that happens
923464,cram,2015-07-06 14:20:00,1733,Why not use minnows instead?  It's better for the lake.
923473,porkpie,2015-07-06 14:58:00,2521,"The question I have for you is why don't you use live bait?  Is it an ethical issue, do you prefer the challenge, do you not want to mess with bait etc?  I hear this a lot from guys that want to target pickerel, and I'm not sure I understand it.  I primarily target 2 species a year, pickerel from the boat, and steelhead from the bank, with the odd side trip for other species.  I catch a ton of pickerel on artificial baits, wether it be cranks, jigs, bucktails etc.  There is a time and place for all of them, but while I could cheerfully target bass all year with artificial bait, sometimes you need a fat crawler or some minnows  for picks.  You can turn negative fish into feeders by bouncing the right bait off their nose, even at 2 in the afternoon on a sunny day.  Anyway, all that aside, try a stinger.  At least that way you'll know what's nipping your tails, usually if it's a sunfish or perch you'll snag em in the side of the head and discover the culprit.  How to stop it? The gulps products and a lot of plastics are like bait, a disposable product unfortunately."
923481,grimsbylander,2015-07-06 16:21:00,3016,Why not use minnows instead?  It's better for the lake.  How is it better?
923491,Sinker,2015-07-06 17:39:00,8692,"I've said it before in your posts about having difficulty with eyes on pigeon. Troll a worm harness along a weed edge at 1.5mph and you will catch as many as you want. Its really as simple as that. I'd like to hear why you don't want to use bait as well. Doesn't make sense to me, if your wanting to catch walleyes.  S."
923492,adempsey,2015-07-06 17:45:00,1498,"You will probably have to use a different brand of grub.  If the plastic is soft so you will always lose tails to panfish.   Happens to me all the time with the Gary Yamamoto grubs, which are excellent baits but quite expensive.     I've switched over to Yum brand grubs for the most part and they work really well,  last a lot longer and are cheaper.  Consider trying some paddletail minnows as well.  There are many good baits out there.  My last outing I used a ""Walleye Killer Rig"" (""B"" in the image below) with a Gulp Fry worm and caught several decent fish popping in through and around the weeds.    Panfish tried, but never managed to bite off my bait.  There is more than one type of Gulp Fry, the one I am talking about is 3"" long.  I've attached an image below.   I am sure other worms would work too.  I plan on trying the Gulp Pinched Crawlers and Killer Crawlers in the future.     "
923495,manitoubass2,2015-07-06 18:13:00,11391,"Jeez I dont think ive had a grub tail ripped off more then 5 times in my life, and its usually removing them from a pikes mouth.  Weird  I use Yum grubs and Kalins almost exlusively.  Kalins grubs are top notch and come in patterns perfect for walleye?"
923496,manitoubass2,2015-07-06 18:15:00,11391,The worst ive used was trying trigger x grubs and paddletails about 3-4 years ago.  I hate those things. Im not sure what rubber they use but its more like soft cement???  Maybe I got real old batches or something???
923503,cram,2015-07-06 18:54:00,1733, How is it better? Fish eat them and they don't digest well.
923532,captpierre,2015-07-06 21:11:00,2521,"Ya so I'm sure minnows would work better. I just hate stabbing a hook thru their mouths or backs.  I guess it's ethical. A worm no problem. A  much more  primitive beast But then is it any different than deep hooking a targeted fish or panfish. I've had great luck rip jigging, using crank baits and stick baits last few years. Squat this year. I've asked others and they are struggling too. Even with minnows. Sinker I guess i better get the worms out. Thought I'd mostly be feeding Rockies. Still bothers me the change in the fishery this year. Thanks for your help everybody. Will keep you posted. Surface water temp 75."

923566,Joeytier,2015-07-06 23:14:00,3990,"Gulp! is not plastic, as someone has mentioned.  I would listen to Sinker about the worm harness thing, obviously he's got them dialed in, but something else to consider is lindy rigging a leech on the weed edges.  Panfish seem to leave leeches alone, even in spots where worms are getting devoured by them."
923568,grimsbylander,2015-07-06 23:26:00,3016,Not the same products. Those are an oil based non- biodegradable plastic. Gulp is not.

923616,Sinker,2015-07-07 02:54:00,8692,"I use a 1/4oz egg weight about 18-20"" from the spinner, where my swivel is. Toss is back a cast, and let out 3 rips of line. Keep tight to the weed edge, and troll 1.5mph....some days more, some slower.  I only use bouncers in deep water....15ft+.  S."
923617,porkpie,2015-07-07 02:57:00,2521,"1 and 2 ounce bottom bouncers are all you'll need in most kawartha lakes.  Drop it over the side, wait till you feel it hit bottom, let it settle and then let out a foot or two more line to account for blowback.  If you feel yourself regularly ticking or dragging bottom, reel up a half turn.  Your bouncer should just touch every so often.  If your holding your rod and feel the hit, feed it back to them a little, then a nice easy sweep.  Reel in fish!  If you have a few guys in the boat , I find a planer board helps with midday fish.  You can run up to at least 2.5 ounce bouncers off a church boards.  1.0-1.5mph is the sweet spot for crawler rigs.  The fish will tell you."
923623,grimsbylander,2015-07-07 03:19:00,3016,"Good point but realistically I think you'd fish a long time before finding a fish with a belly full of Gulp baits. If ever. As far as live bait being better for the lake, I'm not sure that as a general statement is true. Live bait is regulated to control disease, invasive species and the introduction of non native species. The emptying of minnow buckets is one example. There are lakes I know that now are full of suckers, carp, etc. that were trout lakes when I was a kid. I have no idea if it has anything to do with the white bucket brigade but I'm sure if I dumped a couple hundred Gulp baits in the lake for 30 years they wouldn't turn into suckers. I'd like to know if anyone on the forum has ever caught a fish with a bait inside it. Not in its mouth, inside its intestines."
923624,ecmilley,2015-07-07 03:38:00,2163,"i use gulp products regularly for walleyes and have zippo issues with tails being removed by panners, maybe you need a better rod. as for different brand i use yum and phoenix as well, each brand has some characteristics that have proven themselves. also big thing is weight really dont need anything heavier than a 1/4oz in some cases i toss a 1/8 o weed edges"
