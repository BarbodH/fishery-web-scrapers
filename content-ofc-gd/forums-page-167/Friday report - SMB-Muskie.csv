Trolled along and found a couple of LMBass and a Muskie. By 3pm I was exhausted.  17.5"" LMB. I swear by white spinnerbaits trolled behind a kayak or canoe.  He felt like a lot of weight at first, then I knew it was Muskie when he jumped and I can see by the length, it wasn't LMB. He jump right by the boat a couple of times, and I was hoping that he would not jump into the boat and take a chunk out of my legs. 31"". I found my hands shaking after the Muskie revival and release. What a rush."
