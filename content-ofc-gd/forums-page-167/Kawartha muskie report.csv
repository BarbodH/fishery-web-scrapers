923535,Fisherpete,2015-07-06 21:20:00,1814,"A last minute change in plans sent Andrew and I off to the Kawarthas for a muskie hunt. We worked hard and ended up having a decent day on the water. 5 fish landed, 6 follows with one being a giant. All fish were landed between 11am and 4pm under bluebird skies and calm - which is really strange for the Kawarthas! No action at all during the usual productive dawn/dusk times. Oh well, that's fishing for you - just when you think you have things figured out... Andrew caught a 40"" and 33"", I got a 39"", 38"" and 35"". Nothing huge, but lots of fun and great battles - Andrew's 40 did a massive jump that was at least 3' high and 10' across - the most spectacular jump we have ever witnessed. Here's a few pics.          "
