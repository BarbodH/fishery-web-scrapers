923953,blaque,2015-07-08 19:48:00,2419,Indian Falls Lake used to be a trailer park. The family sold to a developer and they built McMansions on it. Many great memories from when I was a kid there. I haven't been down to see family for a few years but am going to the reunion in a few weeks in Clarence center. Small world. You could be sitting on the patio there and I would never know.  I drive thru Clarence Center twice a day to and from work lol

924290,MJL,2015-07-11 14:11:00,2427,"Fantastic pics!  I've been eyeing some of Samsung's offerings for quite some time and the recent reviews all seem favourable.  For mirrorless cameras, I can't really see the need for a super heavy duty tripod...With that said, after using a carbon fiber Manfrotto tripod the last 4 years, it's hard to go back to anything else...You know you want one"

The 2 cons are always the same in all the reviews.......that being the lack of an External Viewfinder and  the 4K being a slight crop of the sensor.  Neither mattered to me as im not coming from years of experience with a viewfinder anyway and actually prefer to compose on the AMOLED screen. Just comfortable doing it that way and i havent found any issue with sunglare ...yet. The 4K crop, not a big deal for me either......at this point. Some even list it as an advantage in some scenarios.  I didnt buy this to shoot video however so im indifferent. Other than that, people are loving this camera and its sensor. Even very experienced photographers are buying into the NX500 and pairing it with the NX1 as a backup.  And your right...........ive been internet shopping tripods and that carbon fiber option is straight secksee!"

923691,blaque,2015-07-07 16:13:00,2419,Last fall i posted asking a million questions about getting into a new camera for hobbyist slash enthusiast photography. I spent way too much time mulling it over but finally pulled the trigger on a cam and decided to go the mirrorless route. Yes there are less lens options but i think theres plenty available to get me into the game. For now anyway. Im sure Ill grow out of this camera but i dont see that happening for quite a while. Im loving the easy to understand touchscreen user interface. Ive got a ways to go to find my way around this thing but thought id post a few initial images both straight out of the camera and a few post processed in lightroom (another learning curve on its own)  Samsung NX500        A couple straight out of the camera             A couple with a little PP in lightroom                   
923692,MrSimon,2015-07-07 16:27:00,217,Outstanding pictures!  You did a great job on the post production editing.
923696,Fisherman,2015-07-07 16:34:00,7201,Very nice!.
923708,blaque,2015-07-07 17:40:00,2419,"Thanks guys.......Im a little overexposed here and there, a little underexposed here and there, missed some focus points, probably oversaturated....  etc.......lol. But ill figure it out eventually  Just having fun playing around with the kit lens until i get the gist"
923709,grimsbylander,2015-07-07 17:46:00,3016,Those pictures are very nice. I think it's more the photographer than the camera!
923710,leaf4,2015-07-07 18:02:00,2466,Nice piece! The camera itself is very nice looking
923711,mr blizzard,2015-07-07 18:04:00,1589,"Beautiful, your picking up fast, funny enough I had just posed the same question on the phtography thread about camera buying ENJOY"
923718,BillM,2015-07-07 18:25:00,17367,Great pics!  Practice practice practice!
923720,blaque,2015-07-07 18:33:00,2419,Thanks again guys.....Bill........i will undoubtedly be picking your brain often lmao
923728,Old Ironmaker,2015-07-07 18:52:00,8243,Professional quality. Keep up the great work and post more.  My favorite is the pic of the graffiti covered concrete pier with the beautiful natural scene behind it. Modern world encroaching onto the beauty of nature. I don't know if that is what you were trying to capture but that's what it says to me.  A photo becomes Art when an emotion is felt by the person looking at it no matter what the media is.
923730,Joey,2015-07-07 19:02:00,9122,"Wow, very nice"
923733,blaque,2015-07-07 19:14:00,2419,"That wasnt my intention, but i like your interpretation  This was way south of Buffalo in a very rural area,....I do find it odd that even out ""in the sticks"", you can find pot leaves symbolized on bridge abutments lol Kids everywhere feel compelled to leave their mark i guess."
923748,Old Ironmaker,2015-07-07 20:23:00,8243,"South of Buffalo is where I spent many summers and caught my first Sunfish. Indian Falls, Batavia area."
923755,blaque,2015-07-07 20:47:00,2419,Indian Falls on Tonawanda Crk? Just north of I-90?
923760,Rodbender,2015-07-07 21:20:00,1027,Nice pic's as Bill says Practice
923856,blaque,2015-07-08 11:21:00,2419,Practice I will..........ive already got head shakes from various fishing partners about needing to put the camera down and get back to my rod lol
923858,BillM,2015-07-08 11:22:00,17367,"Thanks again guys.....Bill........i will undoubtedly be picking your brain often lmao  Anytime man.  My first suggestion, is a decent tripod for those low light situations where you don't wanna pump up the ISO.   There are always deals on them, I'll pass them on when I can."
923871,blaque,2015-07-08 12:41:00,2419,"Yep, my next purchase plan goes something like this. Tripod, Pancake lens (the camera guys rave about a 30mm f2.0) and then something with a little reach  Ive already been in numerous situations where i was trying to put the camera on tree stumps etc to get a longer shutter and use my phone as a remote shutter  (feeble attempts at waterfall pics lol). There was never a tree stump or rock at the right elevation lmao. Tripod it is"
923876,Old Ironmaker,2015-07-08 13:36:00,8243,Yep that's the place Blaque. I still have family that live on Akron Rd. right behind Indian Falls Lake. My Uncle Pete and cousin Mark owned the Falcon Crest Restaurant at Indian Falls.
923884,blaque,2015-07-08 14:40:00,2419,"Cool spot.......i was at the restaurant not too long ago for lunch, great spot to sit and throw down a sandwich for sure. I also drive past it often during the fall/winter/spring when i make my way up to Oak Orchard  Funny thing is i never knew about that little lake........I just google mapped it and saw it tucked away right up the road. Id assume its a private body of water"
923889,BillM,2015-07-08 14:53:00,17367,Keep an eye on Woot!  Vangaurd tripods always come up for sale there..  They've got some nice CF models.
