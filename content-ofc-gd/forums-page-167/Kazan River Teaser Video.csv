924294,solopaddler,2015-07-11 14:32:00,8605,"I just returned from Kasba's Kazan River outpost camp with my young son Brendan. This trip was easily the most amazing fishing experience of my life to date - it will be a hard one to top!  My full report (and it will be a LONG one!) will be posted soon. Until then check out this video recapping the entire trip, there's some pretty incredible highlights in it!  Make sure you change the youtube settings and watch in HI DEF 1080P, it makes a big difference!  Enjoy  "

When are you leaving and where are you going? Cottage?  I'm working on it right now. If lucky I'll be done 3-4am this morning. Midday tommorrow at the latest.  I leave Tuesday morning for Wawa, once again I'm losing my mind. LOL!"

924383,chris.brock,2015-07-12 01:31:00,4053,"Great picture Ryan.  Yeah Mike, the cottage (no internet) for a ten week sabbatical. There's 2 epic, up coming fish trips included in there.  Nose to the grindstone, get that report up."
924405,Skud,2015-07-12 03:44:00,739,My son is asking when the next trip with your son will be. He is ready for the next one.  Great video!
924406,TennesseeGuy,2015-07-12 03:49:00,957,Thanks Mike.   Another great trip.  Watched it on my TV.   You surely captured the colors.  I'll be hitting the sack while you compile the report.  We need to work at getting Bren to show his teeth for fish photos.  .

Yeah Mike, the cottage (no internet) for a ten week sabbatical. There's 2 epic, up coming fish trips included in there.  Nose to the grindstone, get that report up. Right I forgot about the sabbatical, lucky you!  My son is asking when the next trip with your son will be. He is ready for the next one.  Great video! I feel the same way and I know Brendan does too. Let's plan something.  Thanks Mike.   Another great trip.  Watched it on my TV.   You surely captured the colors.  I'll be hitting the sack while you compile the report.  We need to work at getting Bren to show his teeth for fish photos.  . Thank you Connie. As far as Bren smiling goes I can make him do that. A fart joke right when I'm snapping the photo usually does the trick.  I'm fading fast at the moment, I think there might be a delay with the full report."
924412,davey buoy,2015-07-12 09:47:00,5505,Great video and non stop action.Your son sure knows how to handle a fishing rod.Watching him muscle in some of those big ones like a champ !!!!!!
