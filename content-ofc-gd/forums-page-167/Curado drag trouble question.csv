With a fish on, it loads up, then chatters and releases 6' of line or so, then loads up again, etc.  This condition happened suddenly, not gradually.  How can I fix an old reel like that?"

Despite selling my CuradoD, I'll definitely be keeping my CuradoE and Core for a very long time. My dad still has a pretty good condition CH SuperFree and Stradic FG, which have only been serviced once since he's owned them. Definitely built to last!"
924449,Lape0019,2015-07-12 15:21:00,647,Definitely sounds like you need a new drag disc. Carbontex is an upgrade over the original material used. Buy one and add some drag grease and you will be good to go.
