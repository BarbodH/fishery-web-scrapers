923384,npt1,2015-07-05 21:30:00,220,"My wife and I have travelled the route of pain when we lost our beloved dogs over the years. Each time we said no more dogs, slowly the pain ebbs until its time to fill the empty void in the house. We never forgot each beauty that we were blessed to have as our family. R.I. P. Copper, is obvious you were loved a great deal. Sorry for your pain Matt."

923759,muskymatt,2015-07-07 21:15:00,2608,Thanks so much for all the kind words and condolences folks. We are going to pick up his urn tonight. He is greatly missed and we will not forget him for all the love he shared with us. Funny though how the little rituals one has that are so hard when they stop.
923771,bigugli,2015-07-07 22:50:00,6138,"I still miss my girls, Matt.  Find a special place where you know you can visit her often.  I get to visit with Lucky and Peanut every week, or any time I'm missing them. They have a special place in a corner of the farm. My buddy""s Bouviers are there a well. After the past couple of dog threads, I'll be sure to visit them tomorrow."

923922,glenner,2015-07-08 17:47:00,56,"I feel for you, it's probably the toughest thing I have ever had to do, and I've done it several times. My current best buddy, Jake, is a chocolate Lab as well and turned 13 last St. Patty's day. He is having a very tough time now and we just hope he can make it through the rest of the summer so we can have one last season at the trailer with him as he loves it there. It's a cruel irony that their bodies fail them but up to the end, their minds seem sharp. RIP Copper, I'm sure your 13 years were happy ones."

We too had hoped Copper would make one last trip to the island we cottage at, but it was not to be. We go up on the 26th July to the cottage and we will be having a Copper night where we honor him by spreading some of his ashes. We got his ashes back last night. He loved the cottage and lake. Going to be tough without him!"

923134,grimsbylander,2015-07-04 04:28:00,3016,That's a tough thing to do. Our lab is getting on and his time is extremely limited. He fell going up the stairs twice last week. We're dreading the reality that it's weeks maybe months now if we're lucky. Sad situation for you right now. My condolences.

923143,Big Cliff,2015-07-04 09:16:00,6899,"Rainbow BridgeJust this side of heaven is a place called Rainbow Bridge.When an animal dies that has been especially close to someone here, that pet goes to Rainbow Bridge. There are meadows and hills for all of our special friends so they can run and play together. There is plenty of food, water and sunshine, and our friends are warm and comfortable.All the animals who had been ill and old are restored to health and vigor; those who were hurt or maimed are made whole and strong again, just as we remember them in our dreams of days and times gone by. The animals are happy and content, except for one small thing; they each miss someone very special to them, who had to be left behind.They all run and play together, but the day comes when one suddenly stops and looks into the distance. His bright eyes are intent; His eager body quivers. Suddenly he begins to run from the group, flying over the green grass, his legs carrying him faster and faster.You have been spotted, and when you and your special friend finally meet, you cling together in joyous reunion, never to be parted again.The happy kisses rain upon your face; your hands again caress the beloved head, and you look once more into the trusting eyes of your pet, so long gone from your life but never absent from your heart.Then you cross Rainbow Bridge together....Author unknown..."
