924078,mr blizzard,2015-07-09 23:13:00,1589,Nf When I text which is not a lot I hold the phone so the ringer buttons are on the left. Something happened today when I was texting Dave  The key pad is still in the bottom half but the text messages at the top are sideways  What the frig did I do? Thx and don't laugh too hard I grew up writing letters lol
924081,manitoubass2,2015-07-09 23:27:00,11391,Sounds like you locked the screen.  Go to settings and see if you can find a lock screen option and turn it off.  I know my galaxy 6x has that function.
924082,mr blizzard,2015-07-09 23:33:00,1589,Thx Rick I'll try it
924083,manitoubass2,2015-07-09 23:36:00,11391,Or just shut it off and restart it.  Sounds odd
924084,mr blizzard,2015-07-09 23:41:00,1589,Sorry Rick didn't work I didn't go into any settings today
924085,mr blizzard,2015-07-09 23:45:00,1589,Rick your awesome. I totally crap it down and restarted it. Things are ship shape again. Had the phone for roughly a year never did that before Thx again

The purpose of the lock is to lock the screen in portrait mode. You can verify this if there is a little lock symbol at the top right of your screen  G

924346,MCTFisher9120,2015-07-11 22:25:00,3761,"Go back to letters and using the phone...can't stand iPhone got one last week...kept my blackberry with buttons for as long as I could...touch screen = pain in the butt plain and simple.  I remember my flip phone from a 2 or 3 summers ago, battery would last a week no glitches could tex/call with no issues...Now I get to spend more money, I get a crappy touch screen, a battery that lasts a day at best and a bunch of extra crap I already have on my computer at work/home.  We are dumber than we think, the big phone companies got the world hooked.  End of rant and sorry no idea how to help with your phone"
