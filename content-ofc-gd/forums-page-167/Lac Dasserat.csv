924577,jimmer,2015-07-13 14:56:00,2730,"We arrived back from our amazing trip to QC. Fishing was a little tough, but we caught enough for a couple of fish fries and a few to take home.. Love fishing the stained water, which is a far cry from the clear waters of southern Ontario. Great hosts at Mike's Outfitter. My buddy had the extra bonus of bringing home some bear meat from one of the hunters ending his trip on the weekend we arrived.  "
