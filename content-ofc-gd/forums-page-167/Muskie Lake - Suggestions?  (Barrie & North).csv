(I am going to suggest that is mostly because of me, and lack of experience fishing muskie).  Anyone have suggestions on other lakes in the same area we could try?  I don't mind driving a little longer, if the lake is a better producer."
923663,BillM,2015-07-07 13:32:00,17367,Kawarthas is your best bet for numbers.
923667,Sinker,2015-07-07 13:48:00,8692,Kawartha's. Pick a lake.  S.
923698,lew,2015-07-07 16:38:00,12766,"I don't mind driving a little longer, if the lake is a better producer.  If your just looking for numbers of fish the Kawarthas is a good spot as it's almost impossible to have a bad day there, but the majority of your fish will be on the small side.  If you want a chance at multiple fish along with the possibility of some very big fish you may want to consider a drive down to Lake St. Clair."

Taking Matt out - complete 180 - gone from hating fishing (I remember asking him) to all of a sudden loving it.  I guess catching something big will do that...lol.  He wants to take his Bro Inlaw too - so won't have room in the boat.  Can you get another one?"
923912,mepps,2015-07-08 17:11:00,1301,Jack Lake has always been a producer for me. Mepps #5 Black Fury or Musky Killer (they tend to hit smaller lures a lot on this lake for some reason).  I can suggest 3-4 spots if you end up going.
