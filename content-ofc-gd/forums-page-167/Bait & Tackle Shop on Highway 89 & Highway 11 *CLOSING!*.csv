At 1st I thought, maybe he's just getting new stock? Turns out the place is closing!  Just thought I'd get the word out there....Sad to see his business close!"
923695,Fisherman,2015-07-07 16:34:00,7201,"I guess its more of a minnow business for winter, sad to see another one close up."
923716,mr blizzard,2015-07-07 18:17:00,1589,"Went there many times over the years, if you didnt have the correct change you could pay them the next time in, doesnt sound like theres to many bait shops around there anymore"
923723,rbaquial,2015-07-07 18:36:00,968,"The closest Bait shop heading towards Lake Simcoe Marina is somewhere on Ewart St (Convenience Store) on the LEFT (heading towards the Marina).  This is the ONLY PLACE I know of - on the way to the lake...  Anyone else know of other places, please share!"
923960,super dave,2015-07-08 20:44:00,323,Are you talking about the place behind the gas station and pizza place?   That is sad.   Nice guy.

924243,FrankTheRabbit,2015-07-11 00:13:00,479,Does anyone have the exact address or can post a GoogleMaps link? Wouldn't mind taking a pit stop if I knew where it was.  Thanks!

924305,FrankTheRabbit,2015-07-11 16:21:00,479,Thanks Dave for the reply. Is that near Orillia or Gravenhurst or...? The only Hwy 89 that I know of us near Shelbourne. Is that the right area?  Thanks.
924306,davey buoy,2015-07-11 16:22:00,5505,Thanks Dave for the reply. Is that near Orillia or Gravenhurst or...? The only Hwy 89 that I know of us near Shelbourne. Is that the right area?  Thanks. Yonge street and #89 east.East of the 400.Hope that helps Frank?Sort of at the border of West Gwilliumbury and innifil townships.Believe it's called innisfil bait and tackle.
924309,FrankTheRabbit,2015-07-11 17:00:00,479,Many thanks Dave!  I think how Yonge St twists and turns made it difficult to find on GoogleMaps. I should be able to narrow it down now when I'm in that area.  Much appreciated!
924348,Terry,2015-07-11 22:32:00,14456,"400 to 89.  east on 89 .. stop when you hit Yonge st, its there on the right"
