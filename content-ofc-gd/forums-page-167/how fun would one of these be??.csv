924171,wallyboss,2015-07-10 15:02:00,1095,As long as they are not as noisy as the PWC around now.
924172,AKRISONER,2015-07-10 15:10:00,5558,"from the site it sounds like the prototype uses a regular engine but they are in development of an electric version thats silent to give the feeling of riding a snowboard where the only sound is the water underneath you.  Very very cool, being a hardcore snowboarder and wakeboarding during the summer id at least rent one of them for sure.  Cant afford it new $20,000"

924222,aplumma,2015-07-10 21:18:00,6896,I used to ride one of there back in 1986   http://www.powerski.com/montgomery_surfjet.html and yes they are fun but you got to have some really good balance and core strength.   Art
