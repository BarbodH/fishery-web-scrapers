924086,wormdunker,2015-07-09 23:46:00,1711,"Awesome to see your report!  You must be very proud of your father playing along side such greats as Bob McCready, Gaylord Powless.  A high school friend of mine (John Mouradian) also played lacrosse in that era.  He played with the Buffalo Bandits, played & also coached the Toronto Rock.  Last news I heard of Johnny was he was in Phoenix as part owner, general manager.    Do you know of his whereabouts?"
