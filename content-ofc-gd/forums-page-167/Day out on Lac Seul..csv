Took my son Jack up to Lac Seul for the first time last year and ever since our last trip in September 2014 he has been bugging to go back, so back we went!  Fishing is kind of secondary on these trips but I love them more than my solo outings and given it is Lac Seul I still usually get to slam 25""+ walleye for an hour or so anyway.  Here is what we get up to……     video at the bottom of the pictures.          WE ALWAYS STOP AT THE SPRING TO FILL THE WATER BOTTLE, THIS YEAR WE THREW THE MINNOW TRAPS IN AT THE CULVERT ACROSS THE ROAD.                       WE ALSO STOP TO PICK BERRIES ON THE WAY UP, THE BLUEBERRIES WERE STILL GREEN, BUT PLENTY OF WILD STRAWBERRIES AND RASPBERRIES TO MUNCH.                             ONCE AT THE LAKE WE FISHED FOR THE FIRST HOUR                       WE THEN HIT THE BEACH FOR A BOAT PICNIC              GOOFED AROUND AFTER LUNCH                  WENT EXPLORING                   COLLECTED CREATURES FOR JACK'S 'AQUARIUM' (this is Jack's absolute favourite thing about Lac Seul)                        AND HAD A SWIM                       WE DID SOME MORE FISHING AFTER OUR SWIM BUT BY 4PM EVERYONE WAS READY TO GO HOME             CREATURES WERE RELEASED AT THE LANDING, AND HOMEWARD BOUND                 VIDEO  "

923883,manitoubass2,2015-07-08 14:32:00,11391,Nice report Simon!!!!  That looks like a great outing?
923897,Beavertail,2015-07-08 16:10:00,331,"What an action packed trip for your little guy, no wonder he likes going up there! I always get a kick out of seeing young kids develop a fascination for their natural surroundings, good job. Doesn't look too shabby for yourself either, thanks for the report."
923916,glenner,2015-07-08 17:38:00,56,"Boy, that is one ""classy"" chocolate Lab - he drinks Pellegrino while my chocolate drinks from the toilet! Seriously, just great pictures, I envy you this time with your son as my little girl is all grown up and married. Guess I'll have to wait now for the grandkids to take fishing."
923934,Jds63,2015-07-08 18:39:00,1365,You couldn't ask for more than a day like that Simon. Posts like that really make us appreciate the times we can spend with our children ..

923964,lew,2015-07-08 21:02:00,12766,"Your family trips always make for a fantastic read Simon and you pictures are great, but I never know who has the most fun, you, Jack or Roloff"

923992,OhioFisherman,2015-07-09 02:35:00,6623,"LOL, memories, I always had trouble getting my son to fish, he was either chasing critters, or food! Cool pics!"
923995,adempsey,2015-07-09 03:12:00,1498,"Looked like a great day.   Good job on the video, I really enjoyed it.  Your editing is very well done as well."
924012,limeyangler,2015-07-09 12:05:00,5204,"Thanks for the replies guys!  Sorry it took so long to respond, got my father in-law visiting.   I really enjoyed these photos you shared today. Thanks Simon.  My pleasure Tomcat, it makes me happy to know people enjoy these posts and pictures, I certainly get a kick from participating in them and recording them. Thanks for the feedback, always appreciated.    Nice report Simon!!!!That looks like a great outing  Yah, We are wanting to try and take a tent out to that beach this year and camp over night….bug spray not optional….lol.     What an action packed trip for your little guy, no wonder he likes going up there! I always get a kick out of seeing young kids develop a fascination for their natural surroundings, good job. Doesn't look too shabby for yourself either, thanks for the report.  LOL…yeah its hardly a chore for me is it. He absolutely loves everything outdoorsy. We have just finished the hatch in his army worm 'aquarium'….brown fuzzy moths everywhere in the house…but very cool to watch the whole life cycle.    Boy, that is one ""classy"" chocolate Lab - he drinks Pellegrino while my chocolate drinks from the toilet! Seriously, just great pictures, I envy you this time with your son as my little girl is all grown up and married. Guess I'll have to wait now for the grandkids to take fishing.  Lol…I was wondering when someone would catch that, just so you know….he rolls in any poop he finds, deer, horse, dog and even people poo once…..so not so classy after all….lol.  You couldn't ask for more than a day like that Simon. Posts like that really make us appreciate the times we can spend with our children ..  Yeah, I love our summer outings. These videos are great for me to watch on night shifts when I am missing my little guy.  Looks like heaven on Earth !  maybe that's why they call it 'God's country'….or maybe because its only God and blackflies that live here….lol."

Can I have your dog?  LOLOLOL….he would have been on his way to you if you'd asked me that 2 years ago….they take a while to calm down, but now he has….HE AINT GOIN NOWHERE!    LOL, memories, I always had trouble getting my son to fish, he was either chasing critters, or food! Cool pics!  Thanks, yeah….he aint to much into fishing, take it or leave it, so we had to get busy doing other stuff too.    Looked like a great day.   Good job on the video, I really enjoyed it.
