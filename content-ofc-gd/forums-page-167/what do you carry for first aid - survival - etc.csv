Glad I survived and glad I had no kids with me  And get a lifestraw. Just because your near water doesnt mean you can drink it without serious consenquences"

924381,G.mech,2015-07-12 01:28:00,830,"Your kit requirements kind of depend on whether you plan to abandon ship 10 miles offshore in one of the great lakes or get marooned on an island in an isolated Northern lake when your motor quits.  A VHF is no good up North and a bag of munchies is relatively useless drifting half way between Rochester and Port Credit.  In either case, the Marley Herb sounds like a must have but keep it in a good zip lok...."

This stays in the boat for the week........by the way..........it has come in handy on one occasion. I'm at the age now where a satellite phone would be a welcome addition to my emergency bag."
924433,SirCranksalot,2015-07-12 12:59:00,3291," I'm at the age now where a satellite phone would be a welcome addition to my emergency bag.  Rather than a sat phone I would try 1 of these:  http://www.inreachdelorme.com/  My fishing buddy has 1. You don't seem to have to wait for a sat to pass overhead anywhere near as long as you would with a sat phone. Apart from the 911 feature, it can be used to re-assure the worriers at home that you are OK via texting. On a trip up North out of cell phone reach my buddy used it to send msgs to his wife and our base camp."
924466,colin519,2015-07-12 17:47:00,101,"i fish with rentals so usually small boats. it can get big out there real quick, and usually the reality would be a prop knock or engine failure that causes you to spend the night paddling or camping if you are down the lake.  i just carry a slightly better backup of what the rental boat kit is, with some extra items. i got this new Maxpedition bag to make it something that can just go into my tackle bag.  Now in a Maxpedition Bottle Bag, in a stainless Nalgene bottle, I've got a solar blanket, 20 aquatabs, bandana, 50ft paracord, swedish fire steel and a lighter. In the little pocket, my Leatherman multitool, powerful flashlight, loud whistle, could probably add a small flare or 3. I've got some floating rope in my tackle bag too.  Would be easy enough to fill the Nalgene with water and jam some things into the bag or pocket if I wanted to use it for extra water, but I usually use another water bottle on the boat.  Just seemed like it would be good to make sure I had something to stay on the boat, as we often shore lunch randomly or fish all day off and on and may have left some gear at camp having just planned to go out for an hour and end up out for 4 hours and low on fuel."
923774,2 tone z71,2015-07-07 23:16:00,1311,the older I get and the farther I seem to wonder offshore the more I start to worry..ive recently invested in a first aid kit from crappy tire for starters..was wondering what type of things/stuff you fellas are carrying for safety etc

923798,2 tone z71,2015-07-08 00:50:00,1311,that's what I am after Joey...compass is good too.. I am usually several miles offshore in a boat ..
923803,G.mech,2015-07-08 01:14:00,830,"When fishing out on the big lakes I carry a compass, flares (whether required by law or not), handheld VHF, whistle, flashlight all in a waterproof 'ditch kit' that can be grabbed quick if needed.  On board we have a first aid kit, VHF with DSC, and all other required gear."
923804,porkpie,2015-07-08 01:29:00,2521,"The reality is that if you are a couple of miles off shore, make sure you have real life jackets, complete with whistles and a cyalum light attached.  That will be more important than anything else you can carry.  I've never had an unfortunate incident, but had my heart in my throat a few times.  All accounts I've read from mishaps, people have found themselves in the water pretty quick.  I run with real adult life jackets (with the goofy kids collars) on the seat backs.  They have a whistle and a cyalum light.  If I'm on my own on a great lake, I wear one, If I'm on an inland lake, I wear my inflatable PFD.  I carry a charged cell phone in a waterproof (I hope) case in my pocket, and I keep a water resistant portable VHF at hand.  I'm thinking about a ditch bag, but I'm guessing it would be mostly useless in an emergency any distance from shore, unless it contained a handheld VHF.  I always carry a pocket knife when fishing anyway, so don't need that, and I can't figure what I'd do with much else If I was floating around in the water offshore, other than wanting a means to call for help and give location.  Probably a small water resistant GPS so I could give an approximate location.  I do keep a couple of short lengths of ropes with light carabiners attached.  Sounds silly, but I fish with my kids a fair bit, and have a horrible vision of ending up in the water with them and losing one of them in rough weather.  I figure at least I could daisy chain us together.  Anyway, interested to hear other responses.  Compass is a good idea, probably will get a couple and put them on the life jackets although I keep one in the boat."

923826,Moosebunk,2015-07-08 02:45:00,3970,"Just went thru my First Aid kit last week.  It's a small case, maybe 12 X 8 inches.  Pulled out a tensor and some prepackaged saline soaked guaze to add some extra skin glues, 3/0, 4/0 and 5/0 Prolene sutures, 10cc syringes, fine 27 guaze 1 1/2 inch needles, and a half dozen amps of Lidocaine 1%.  There's some bandages, antiseptics and other things in there as well, but the only times I've opened the kit is to pull out the freezing, inject the sorry angler who got a hook in them or laceration, clean and then sew 'em up.  Carry plenty of other things too.  Like extra flashlights, (headlamp) lighters, tools and knife,  Long trips a small tarp, blanket, plenty rope and spare prop."

923850,porkpie,2015-07-08 08:12:00,2521,Basically a glow stick.  You snap it in the middle and it will glow for 10-12 hours.
923851,G.mech,2015-07-08 10:10:00,830,". How does that handheld VHF work for ya ? Good signal ?  Boat to boat the range isn't great but they will reach the Coast Guard Tower in most cases on the great lakes.  Many of the new ones are 6 Watts now and some even have built in GPS with DSC for even better range and automatic distress transmission of your position.  Maybe it's overkill but if you ever find you need it, I think you'd be happy to have one.  This model is full featured for under 200 bucks:  http://radioworld.ca/m92d-p-10678.html"

923911,manitoubass2,2015-07-08 17:10:00,11391,"Any pharmacy carries it.  And another good thing to bring on a trip is codeine(although I hate saying that)  If you get stranded and sprain an ankle or break a bone it would sure help.  Also if you cant get a clean water source or suffer dehydrating diarhhea codeine will help lesson the severity  Im talking the mild stuff, tylenol 1's sold over the counter"
