924385,mike rousseau,2015-07-12 01:39:00,4661,I got a fenwick at Canadian tire and love it...
924394,bigbuck,2015-07-12 02:17:00,2449,"Uglystik us great if you do not care too much about sensitivity. They are very durable thoygh so if you are rough on your gear,it would be a good option."
924395,Hansuld71,2015-07-12 02:21:00,9,I have an ugly stick it's pretty good all around or did recommend it
924426,Weeds,2015-07-12 12:08:00,782,I think there is an ultralight St croix avid for sale in the classified at 120.  Fantastic rods.

924437,FloatnFly,2015-07-12 13:22:00,1640,"I think there is an ultralight St croix avid for sale in the classified at 120. Fantastic rods.  I see that! great rod, but is it worth going into downtown toronto during the pan am games chaos for? i dunno.  could be a 4 or 5 hour drive with traffic backups cause of the stupid HoV lanes   going to pop into Sail today and see what they have"
924442,bow slayer,2015-07-12 14:01:00,1074,"I picked up an ultralight from CT a couple years ago,it is a shimano Bob Izumi series,excellent ultralight,I think it was around 70 bucks."

924447,Gregoire,2015-07-12 14:37:00,1397,I've driven in the city a lot during the games. If you are off peak it is ok. Also driven a few times with the family. The HOV lanes were great. If you have to drive through the city the 407 is always an option.

924465,DOS,2015-07-12 17:31:00,119,"Get yourself a Fenwick Eagle in UL or L, great rod for panfish, and only $62  Gagnons should have them, I see you are in the Shwa... The Ugly stick ultra light is like fishing with a wet spagetti noodle..."
924476,FloatnFly,2015-07-12 19:05:00,1640,"Picked up a Daiwa Tri-Force UL, a Daiwa Laguna 2000 reel and 4lb Trilene.  I had the Fenwick in my hands, and didn't quite like the way the grip felt in my hands.  For $93 got the whole outfit.  Maybe try it out tonight in Whitby Harbour  Also picked up a power inverter for the truck so I can plug my shop-vac into it to blow up my inflatable boat.  got a Fish Hunter 260 by Sevylor"
924519,Acountdeleted,2015-07-12 23:56:00,2562,"The Ugly Stik lite was the first ever 'serious fishing rod' I've ever used. Paired with my Pfluger President it has caught tiny walleye, and small bass all the way up to 10 pound Sheepshead. Plus it's durable. I have slammed the tip in the car door lots of times.  When I got my Mojo Bass I could tell the difference in sensitivity but the Ugly Stik should treat you very well."
924533,ecmilley,2015-07-13 02:04:00,2163,Had a clarus worked good decent foe the money. Recently purchased a st croix panfish rod ul one peice 7ft oitstanding rod was a little hi though atb $120
924535,manitoubass2,2015-07-13 02:16:00,11391,Fenwick/st croix if ya got the cash.  I have a clarus too and love it. Great sensitivity
924542,FloatnFly,2015-07-13 04:10:00,1640,"Went into Gagnons, felt they were a little over priced on their rods, so hopped over to Sail.  Put all the ultra light rods i could and lined them up, put each one in my hand and picked the one that felt best, and that was the diawa.  its rated for 1-4lb and 3/32oz-1/8oz"
924565,netminder,2015-07-13 13:58:00,514,"Nice, I have a fish hunter as well. Couldn't tell you the model number but it seats 2 and has slats on the floor so I can stand up and wooden benches. Great for small lakes with an electric. I feel like I'll fall out of the boat before I'd tip it over too. great for pursuing panfish like it sounds like you will be with your new ultra-light. Good luck!"

Good luck!  Not just for panfish.  Theres some beauty pike spots around here, also for river mouths that are tucked into harbours, theres a few, great for salmon and steelhead.  theres also a couple of area that will boats, but only electric motors or paddles, no gas engines even if they aren;t running, great pike, bass and carp spots"
924574,FloatnFly,2015-07-13 14:38:00,1640,"Also, worse that can happen with the Diawa, I don't like the way it feels on the panfish, I give it to my daughter and pick up the Fenwick"
924576,AKRISONER,2015-07-13 14:56:00,5558,"just throwing in my 2 cents even though you bought a rod, for others that are interested, i bought a bass pro UL glass for 24 bucks and actually love it.  I paired it with a Shimano sienna FD that I got on sale from crappy can and it literally fishes as well as one of my 150 dollar combos.  rods a little whippy but nothing wrong with it when fishing UL, the fighting power is there. caught a few 3 lb smallies on it and it wasnt an issue."
