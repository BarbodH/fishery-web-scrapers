923880,John Bacon,2015-07-08 14:25:00,3277,Interesting read.  I would certainly never have thought of this.   http://www.keepcanadafishing.com/coke-its-the-real-thing-to-stop-fish-bleeding/
923882,Headhunter,2015-07-08 14:29:00,5703,Who knew! Thanks for posting this John... now what to do with those slices of lime! HH
923887,mistyriver1,2015-07-08 14:46:00,600,Very cool
923898,paul_614,2015-07-08 16:15:00,168,"Just imagine the fish ""bouncing off the walls"" once the sugar rush kicks in"
923902,kickingfrog,2015-07-08 16:24:00,8333,"Careful, you could stop the bleeding but also stop the breathing with too much CO2."
923918,Fisherman,2015-07-08 17:42:00,7201,"Exactly, it's a vasoconstrictor, meaning the blood vessels shrink.  Not exactly the smartest thing in my book if your trying to revive a fish and get it back in the water."
923921,manitoubass2,2015-07-08 17:45:00,11391,If ya got a bleeding fish just get it back in the water and let it coagulate on its own.
923943,huzzsaba,2015-07-08 18:58:00,884,Hey can I get a coke? No its for the fish! What?!?  Good to know.  Now I will have to keep a bottle with me when going fishing.  Does it have to be fizzy or will flat work?  cause Id hate to take a new bottle each time I go fishing lol
923944,huzzsaba,2015-07-08 19:00:00,884,"Just imagine the fish ""bouncing off the walls"" once the sugar rush kicks in  lol  maybe not if you use diet coke"
923946,NAW,2015-07-08 19:12:00,4022,"Interesting.  But is anyone here actually going to do it??  I am certainly not packing coke with my on my fishing trips.  If I hook a fish really deep and I know it will not survive,  then it goes in my stomach, along with the coke."
924007,wormdunker,2015-07-09 09:58:00,1711,Good one NAW.  But is it with rum & coke or rye & coke?
924009,Garnet,2015-07-09 11:17:00,2056,"Of the 1000's of things in my boat a bottle Coke not that big a deal. Have released a few smallies  that I thought were sure to die, couple hour stay in the livewell looked good off you go."
924017,SirCranksalot,2015-07-09 12:49:00,3291,Put a bit of rum in it and the fish will be feeling no pain!!(P3TA would approve!!)
924036,netminder,2015-07-09 16:11:00,514,"Interesting.  But is anyone here actually going to do it??  I am certainly not packing coke with my on my fishing trips.  If I hook a fish really deep and I know it will not survive,  then it goes in my stomach, along with the coke. Kind of my thought too... not sure this method will really help in the long term."
924042,manitoubass2,2015-07-09 17:19:00,11391,"Well it says carbonated soda water.  If I was gonna do this(which im not), id just use club soda or and soda water, not coke  I dont like the idea of pouring a corrosive on a fish because its bleeding.  If its bleeding that bad ill keep it. If its not bleeding too bad get it back in the water and let nature do its thing"
924043,manitoubass2,2015-07-09 17:23:00,11391,"Next up, bring $50 worth of leeches fishing with you, but not as bait...  If a fish is gill hooked add some leeches to stop the bleeding???"
924044,Terry,2015-07-09 17:32:00,14456,I use beer  well I dont pour it in the fish   I drink it while waiting to see if the bleeding will stop
924045,manitoubass2,2015-07-09 17:36:00,11391,????
924061,mattaw,2015-07-09 19:47:00,162,"This is not the best thing for the fish, as others have said, put it back in the water, or if it's going to die, take it home to the table.  This article sums it up nicely: http://drowningworms.com/can-you-stop-fish-bleeding-from-the-gills-with-coke-sprite/"

924121,Garnet,2015-07-10 09:42:00,2056,Letting fish die that can swim away. NO THANKS.  And worrying about 2 ml of Coke in a lake. Stop drinking Rum and coke and pissing in the toilet.
