Never had a roll quite like that before.  My net had a small hole in the bottom already from cutting a lure out a while ago, the first pike when I got him into the boat fell through the net and made the hole much larger, so the next 2 pike I had to grab by hand. Guess I need a new net.     "

923865,msp,2015-07-08 12:08:00,1336,Sounds like a great flurry ! I don't use nets. I don't like the way they roll around and get all tangled in the line and net. Hand landing is the way to go
