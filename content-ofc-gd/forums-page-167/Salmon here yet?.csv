924071,captpierre,2015-07-09 21:06:00,2521,Wondering if there is any consistent salmon action on the north shore?
924072,Gallie,2015-07-09 22:11:00,1215,"Ill let you know when i go out for round 2 on saturday. I went out last weekend and went 5/5 all little guys, didnt mark a good hook all day and only a handfull of small bait clouds. With the nicer weather im hoping the lake will setup nicely for the weekend and hopefully the fish will pile up a bit somewhere. Tightlines!"
