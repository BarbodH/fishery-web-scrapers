923726,Old Ironmaker,2015-07-07 18:50:00,8243,"What a wonderful report. The time we have with our heroes is priceless. I have been missing my Nono since I was 12. We didn't fish or hunt together but I remember sitting beside him and he would show me all the amazing places there are in the World in an old Rand McNally Atlas that predated WW2. Cherish the time you can spend with them, you can never get it back. I have the Atlas and it is my most treasured thing I have above all else. Start planning a return trip now."

Many times while out fishing on my own I reflect back on the things we enjoyed as a family."
923875,Beavertail,2015-07-08 13:31:00,331,"Thanks for the very enjoyable read, what a great story. Getting to fish with uncle and grand-father must have been pretty special. I can't imagine still fishing at 90, talk about inspirational! Fishing that creek for specks, driving the quads, exploring pool after pool AND the shore lunch...you must have been like a kid in a candy store!"
