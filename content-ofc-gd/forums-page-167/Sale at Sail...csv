Quantum TEAMKVD 7,0:1  on a Omen Black 6'7"" MH.  Very nice lookin', don't own any rods by 13..  I'm sure the Shimano is a better reel than the Q.. Thoughts??  This should be a good worn/jig rig.   "
924654,BassMan11,2015-07-14 01:35:00,583,The Chronrch is a great reel that casts a mile. Great reel for all around use. I actually picked up the quantum reel on Sunday for s new flipping stick. Good reviews so far from me.
924657,HTHM,2015-07-14 01:53:00,4082,Chronarch all the way. Provided it has Japan on the seat.

The shimano's (stradic fj, chronarch and core) are all great deals on super reels. The KVD is nice for the money but obviously not near the shimano's, a nice spare though, a couple guys at the store bought them for beaters. And lastly the omen, I'd stay away from it myself, considering how many are sold a lot come back for warranty issues."
