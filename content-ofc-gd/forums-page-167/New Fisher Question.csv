I love trout fishing, The forks of the credit is a beautiful spot and Glen Haffy is great for practice. I was wondering if anyone could point me into the right direction for some decent trout fishing in the area? I don't mind a drive but am looking for something new. I'm not looking for specifics but maybe a lake name drop is all!  I'm also very open to Bass fishing and have tried the Islands and lake scugog but with not much luck"

923842,Freshtrax,2015-07-08 04:50:00,2215,Fairly tough to get creeks that hold summer trout within an hour or two of the gta outta people. Not only are they rare but the fish can't take much pressure.  May want to start bass fishing in the summers.  Come fall and winter any water that is attached to a Great Lake is a good place to be.
