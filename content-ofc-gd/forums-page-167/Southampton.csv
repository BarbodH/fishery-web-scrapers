Looking for suggestions on locations and what to target. Will be fishing from shore most likely. Is Denny's Dam still an option now? Maybe the pier at the mouth of the Saugeen?  Thanks,"
924032,BillM,2015-07-09 15:18:00,17367,Chucking hardware in the 'Geen below Dennys all the way to the lake is never a bad idea.
924048,fishing n autograph,2015-07-09 17:55:00,2540,Huge smallies can be caught off the pier in Southampton. I've also seen large carp and sheepshead there too. Drive down the road to port Elgin. They've revitalized the harbour and you can get some nice pike and bass cruising there in the morning
924068,Musky or Specks,2015-07-09 20:57:00,2710,All kind of places on the Geen are great for bass.
