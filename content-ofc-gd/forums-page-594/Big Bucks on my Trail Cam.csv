534606,LucG,2011-01-04 14:39:00,779,"OK OK ... I know it is now January and everybody has switched over to hardwater fishing, and so have I. But the other day I went and retreived my trail cam that I had left at my deer stand and was amazed at the acticity.  From November 28th to December 24th, I had my camera maxed out at 3400 pictures. All deer, besides the odd blue jay and rabbit. I figure there were about 5-6 (in my eyes) trophy bucks. Dozens of smaller spike horns, 4,6 & 8 points, and many many does and fauns.  I've picked out a few of the nicer bucks, as well as a group of canines hot on their trail.  There's allways next year...right...  Enjoy...                          "

534628,cityfisher,2011-01-04 16:26:00,959,"impressive ! long wait till next season, atleast you have a ton to choose from next year"
534697,LucG,2011-01-04 20:43:00,779,"Yes, it will be a long wait. Until then, I'll keep looking at these pics. Should I post one up in the ice shack? lol"
534703,Joey,2011-01-04 20:59:00,9122,Cool!
534716,fish_fishburn,2011-01-04 21:25:00,1311,"I was wondering why those big bucks were mostly looking back, till we got to the wolf pic. Awesome, thanks."
534725,Rod Caster,2011-01-04 21:47:00,5784,Very cool Luc. I bet those pics make you look forward to next year....although you know that they won't be within 50 miles when you have a gun on you.
534729,Steve_R,2011-01-04 22:07:00,81,Great Pictures Thanks for sharing...
534842,Skud,2011-01-05 03:19:00,739,Great pictures. Amazing how you still don't have daylight pics of those big Bucks with 3400 pictures taken. Thems smart critters.
534848,Pigeontroller,2011-01-05 03:39:00,2793,Very cool pics!  Coyotes???
534887,LucG,2011-01-05 13:50:00,779," You got that right! They didnt survive the season by being stupid. lol I managed to get a stupid doe and faun tho    In this area its prob a mix, we call them brush wolves. They are not quite as big as a true northern timber wolf."
534917,wuchikubo,2011-01-05 15:43:00,1114," Looks like you should set a trap for the canines. Look like nice pelts on them.  However, it would look a bit challenging for the traps not to seize up or get frozen over the foot plate.  Happy new year and happy trapping!  P.s. I still haven't even registered my trapping license as I haven't determined an area yet.  Stan"
534920,LucG,2011-01-05 15:52:00,779," If I were to trap them, I would definitly snare them. But since this township is bordering Algonquin park, the wolves are protected."
534945,wuchikubo,2011-01-05 17:17:00,1114,"  I see, then it's a no-no. Thanks posting the pics."
534961,oxcowboy,2011-01-05 18:33:00,544,wow those are some very nice deer you got there.  now to find their sheds when they come off.  i enjoy hunting sheds almost as much as the deer hunting itself.  jason
