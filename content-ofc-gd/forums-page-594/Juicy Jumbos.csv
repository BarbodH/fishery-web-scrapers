534459,Rod Caster,2011-01-04 01:27:00,5784,Walked on the lake without an auger (need new blades). A friendly shack owner punched two holes for me and I was very grateful for the kindness of strangers.  Looks like 10-11 inches off good ice now. All caught on a Salmo darter in perch design except two on minnows.  I've caught bigger perch on Simcoe but never measured them...what's the biggest perch you've gotten? I'd like to know what the standard is.      
534465,crappieperchhunter,2011-01-04 01:43:00,2582,"Nice feed of perch you got there. I usually only keep them between 10-12 inches on Simcoe. I got a few 13+ in the fall and a couple through the ice so far this winter, but have not managed any over 14 since last spring.  Generally I get a dozen or so 14+ inchers over the course of a year. However I have never landed a perch over 15...and yes I do get out perching alot."
534467,skeeter,2011-01-04 01:45:00,1907,"13"" is the biggest i have caught on simcoe, i believe. but have seen the 15"" come out of there."
534470,Terry,2011-01-04 01:47:00,14456,nice sized perch there
534499,Rod Caster,2011-01-04 02:44:00,5784,"  Most of these keepers were between 8-11inches....which is a good average size for up here. I'll typically keep anything over 7"" .  A 15"" perch is a monster. I'd guess that my biggie from Simcoe this summer was around 14"".  My goal is now to catch a 15 incher."
534501,irishfield,2011-01-04 02:52:00,26272,I never understood why Roy liked warm Old Milwaukee... but I'm startin to understand!!  Nice feed of perch !

534510,bigugli,2011-01-04 03:03:00,6138,"Nice looking perch you have there.  My largest is 14 3/4"""
534514,Nipfisher,2011-01-04 03:18:00,2449,"Rod Caster, Lots of 12"" perch come from Nip each winter. I'm off at 4:30 we should walk out to a secret spot I know for some jumbos. Close to the gov. dock."
534526,young_one,2011-01-04 04:02:00,620,Ice perch! Are those the smallest size of Salmo darters? How did you fish them? Tip or no?
534539,moxie,2011-01-04 05:05:00,1566,Nice catch. I can taste them now. Can't wait to get out to Simcoe. I don't have the best time management skills I tell ya.   Moxie.
534562,Rod Caster,2011-01-04 12:48:00,5784,"  yes it was the smallest size at the shop. I don't tip them. They were quite aggressive to it, even on standstill you could feel them hammer it.    I can't even have my 15 minutes with you around eh?  Off to Hammer tonight...sry...but this weekend?????     Us Nipissing guys keep close secrets..we don't tell anyone about emerald shinners and jigging hardware such as Salmo Darters and Swedish Pimples. "
