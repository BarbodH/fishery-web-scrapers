534771,Rod Caster,2011-01-05 00:16:00,5784,"Some people set fishing goals each season and I am one of them. I don't get disappointed when I miss them but I sure am happy when I reach them. Anybody here in the same boat?  Here are the ""attainable"" goals I have set for myself for 2011 ice fishing.  Lake trout over 5lbs. At least couple walleye over 5lbs. Perch over 12 inches. Ling to keep and taste for the first time. Splake any size.    "
534772,Guest Manitoubass,2011-01-05 00:22:00,0,"sturgeon, anything bigger than 40lbs.  as many 10+lbs walleye as possible  lol, very simple goals.  Also, stay away from lawyers and lampreys  win the local winter derby this year (should have had it last winter, damned rain)"
534779,MCTFisher9120,2011-01-05 00:57:00,3761,"Targeting Pike this winter mainly, last season my biggest was a 32"" pike I think it was. A 34"" + Northern would be a goal for myself."

534888,BillM,2011-01-05 14:10:00,17367,Find some open water and catch some steelhead. Lay a beating on the whities and lakers on Simcoe as well.
534889,Rod Caster,2011-01-05 14:14:00,5784,"Lots of Simcoe guys chomping at the bit! If I was still living in Barrie, trust me, Simcoe Whitties and Lakers would be high on my list!!"
534956,Pikeslayer,2011-01-05 17:47:00,1443,"It's been about 15 years since I was last ice drinking fishing. I would actually like to get out and fish for real as opposed to sitting all day in a hut and getting hammered. I'm too old (& smart?) for that any more. Anyone interested in trading a day on the ice (you provide the gear) in exchange for a July/August day on LO for salmon & bows (my boat & gear)?? I'd really like to experience true ice fishing. BTW, I can be available any day of the week.  Regards Simon"
534967,craigdritchie,2011-01-05 19:01:00,1586,"My goals for this winter are quite simple, really:  1. Finally get off my duff and order new neoprenes from Cabela's (maybe this afternoon, now that I'm thinking of it) 2. Spend some quality time on the West Coast renewing my love affair with ocean-going steelhead (trip booked, early Feb) 3. Spend some quality time in the Gulf of Mexico renewing my love affair with with wahoo, dolphin and king mackerel (trip booked, late Feb) 4. Keep a straight face every time I see the Loafs still holding steady at 26th place in a 30-team league 5. Hope for an early spring so I don't have to ice fish at all"
535044,skeeter,2011-01-05 21:58:00,1907,Craig_Ritchie: fyi- lebarons has caddis neoprene stocking foots on for $65. it was there spring special but they still have some. i bought a pair in nov.
