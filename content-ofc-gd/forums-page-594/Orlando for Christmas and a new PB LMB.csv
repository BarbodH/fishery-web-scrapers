533724,Cudz,2011-01-02 03:04:00,2652,"We were in Orlando for Christmas so I brought a single spinning rod and reel on the off chance that I could get out for a fish.  I deceided to buy a 1 week freshwater licence and try my luck.  I only brought 3 lures with me so I was going to give it a go.  The first place I fished was at my cousins house.  They live on a lake in a mansion but are avid waterskiers, not fishermen. In fact, my cousin is one of the best Canadian waterskiers. Anyway, I sneaked out of the house for 20 minutes of fishing of their dock.  I threw a wacky rigged senko and managed a total of 5 dink bass (caught 3 on the first 4 casts).  They were all about a pound.   Later on in the week I decided to try my hand at fishing a pond in the middle of a very busy and popular area across from Disney.  I watched a guy catch an 11 pounder and 5 pounder using shiners.  He gave me one but I only fished for 10 mins with it and without success.  I thought the small lake was shallow but turns out it was 20ft deep.  So much for my weightless senko.  Either way, it is a learning curve and that is what I was doing.  Share the water with this cool little alligator as well.    Knowing there are big bass there I decide to go to BPS and get some weights and some drop shot bait. I go back to the small lake and this little kid of 10 years old is slammin fish.  He has caught about 4 catfish and a nice 3 pound bass while I am there.  He is a british kid and I ask him what he using and he tells me sausages.  They are hotdog wieners.  I laugh but I take a couple from him and sure enough I catch 3 or 4 catfish. THey are all the same size  I actually stop laughing about the hot dog when the kid latches onto a legit 8 pound largie!!   On the last day we are there my wife suggests that I bring the rod and try for about an hour for a bass.  I cut up the oscar meyers and away I go. I manage a bunch of catfish and then a nice little largie.  With only 10 minutes to I am watching my line and I see it move. Something has picked up my 2 inch chunk of hotdog. I pick up my rod and set hook hard.  Solid fish and it is coming to the surface.  It tries to jump but only the head comes out.  There is a huge crowd of tourists around and manage to reach down and lip the big bass to roaring approval of the crowd.  It was so funny. People were cheering and clapping. I held the fish high as if I were Ike and had just won the Bassmaster classic. The fish had a big big head. In another lake that fish could be 9 pounds.  It was very long but not too fat.  I didn't have my scale with me but it wa a good fish and a PB Largie for me. It was fun for sure.  Fitting that I caught my PB bass at the headquaters of B.A.S.S.Might have to try the old hotdog trick on Simcoe this july. lol  "

534505,Rod Caster,2011-01-04 02:55:00,5784,Huge head and quite thin..... I guess there aren't many natural hot dogs in that lake for him to feed on.  Had a good laugh at the part where everyone was cheering!
534511,Nipfisher,2011-01-04 03:05:00,2449,I guess there may be some fish meat in a hot daod. Mystery meat.  Seroiusly I posted last year about the pike we caught with the cheese filled sausage in its stomach.
534515,SRT8 smoker craft,2011-01-04 03:32:00,1107,Nice Bucket man!!! ya gotta love the cheering tourists I had the same thing at the credit quite a few years ago landed a 15ish nook and when I lifted it out of the water for a pic the crowd that had gathered started clapping and cheering and lots of them were snapping pics and I'm pretty sure one dude was video taping the whole thing LOL.  I still think your gonna have a hard time topping that one in Ontario.
