534568,bubbles,2011-01-04 13:07:00,591,On to the Russians!
534571,Rod Caster,2011-01-04 13:09:00,5784,The Swedes were PISSED at the referreeing after the Russia game.  Canada Played fantastic last night.... it doesn't take away from the fact that the Americans have a fantastic team as well. Good job to all the kids.  
534603,bigugli,2011-01-04 14:34:00,6138," Canada should have been complaining about the ref as well. Starts with a bogus ""high sticking"" and a blatant head shot."
534609,NAW,2011-01-04 14:50:00,4022," Ya, no kidding eh!  What's with that.  They call a slashing penalty on Canada for chopping at the goaly, but it was the USA defenceman who chopped his own goaly in the head.."
534612,bubbles,2011-01-04 14:53:00,591,"Definate head shot too.  Refing was brutal.  High paced, hard hitting game, the way hockey should be played."
534629,misfish,2011-01-04 16:37:00,29133," Ah yes,North American style. Exactly what I was saying.Nice to see hockey played the way it was meant to be.  And yes,if it werent for Campbell,great piece of goaltending."
534717,Billy Bob,2011-01-04 21:28:00,5865," NO apology necessary as I don't even watch hockey and actually find it boring...  BTW is that your picture in the quoted area...  Bob, not Billy..."
534742,Cookslav,2011-01-04 22:46:00,1457," The IIHF rules, and officiating are and always have been random. Phantom calls, and Bias are HUGE issues....but the norm.  For what they consider a slash....we could see 60+ minutes in Penalties if they kept is consistant. I honestly think they use the slashing calls when they need to even things up.  Another thing... I think alot of pressure to make calls come from somewhere ""upstairs"" Anyone else notice the Kassian hit was not a penalty at all....until someone from ""upstairs"" called the time keeper.  Its sad that this kinda poor officiating and inconsitent enforcement has not been addressed in a stonger manner. Because it really can be a major factor in a close game. Lets just hope for a good, clean officiated Game tommorrow."
534745,misfish,2011-01-04 22:58:00,29133," Did you notice that the commentary guys had one rule first""hit to the head"" then it was a ""hit to the head or neck"" then it was a ""hit to the head,the neck or even the way they hit thier head on the ice""  You nailed that one cookslav."
534867,Billy Bob,2011-01-05 10:50:00,5865,GOOD LUCK CANADA....I hope you knock the _ _ _ _ _ off the Russians.
534900,blaque,2011-01-05 14:48:00,2419,In the end......Kassian and Foligno are going to be playing for Buffalo.
