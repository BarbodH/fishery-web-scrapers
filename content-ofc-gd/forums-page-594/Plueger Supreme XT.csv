Steve"
534338,blaque,2011-01-03 22:00:00,2419,Have two of the pflueger presidents and i like em just fine for the cost.  Actually i bought them for the nephew as im not spending 200 dollars on reels for him the way he beats his gear lol.  But ive used them and they are a nice reel.  Sorry ubt ive got no input on the supremes

534437,ohhenrygsr,2011-01-04 00:47:00,947,I've got both and i love my President gear ratio is slower compared to the Supreme.  The Supreme is a bit lighter as well and the handle on the supreme is bigger compared to the president.  You do get your monies worth with the supreme.
