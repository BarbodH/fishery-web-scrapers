534901,Terry,2011-01-05 14:48:00,14456,i have not checked in a couple of years but it use to be that if you try to copy it you screw up the original too
534905,skeeter,2011-01-05 14:55:00,1907, glad i asked before doing!!!!!! thanks Terry.  like i always say: what is the worst 4 letter word in the english language?   
534910,Terry,2011-01-05 15:19:00,14456,"however, if you have their mapcreate program you can put parts of it on a sd card and use it, I think you can make up to 3 of them"
534921,mbac31,2011-01-05 15:57:00,904,"They cant be copied. If you try and place it in the Computer it will be erased. If you have a program like , Map Create, Fugawi, or Nav Planner you can view and make you rown. I have the softare from Doc Sampson for creating my own 3D type cards that are better then the Navionics, Takes alot of work but very rewarding in the end. I now have cards for just about every lake I go on. I have a ton of SD cards but it keeps everything organized. Lowrance has a program on their site or organizing waypoints and other stuff for free if you want. Try and find Map Create for Canada if you can."
