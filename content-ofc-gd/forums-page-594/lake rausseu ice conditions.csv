529597,cityfisher,2010-12-17 20:37:00,959,was there last saturday... covered but Way too much snow on top to tell... Id assume it needs a couple more weeks to Firm up
529949,wee scot,2010-12-18 23:14:00,75,Thanks for the update cityfisher glad to hear she is covered over
529975,Guest gbfisher,2010-12-19 01:07:00,0,  What part of the lake were you looking from. As of this passed thursday all three lakes are wide open.  http://coastwatch.glerl.noaa.gov/modis/modis.cgi/modis?region=h&page=1&template=sub&image=a1.10350.1834.LakeHuron.143.250m.jpg
530005,4x4bassin,2010-12-19 03:30:00,1025,Just talked to someone from Minet (Lake Rosseau) and they tell me that the small bays are iced over but the main lake is wide open. Also those sat. pictures from NOAA tell the tale as well. I'm sure it will be awhile yet !
530036,chuck,2010-12-19 12:21:00,7,Can't wait until freeze up itching to due some hard water fishing
530664,wee scot,2010-12-21 21:20:00,75,"thanks for the response guys ,sorry for the topic typo"
530668,cityfisher,2010-12-21 21:34:00,959, Not sure what part i was on but I assume it was a small backbay.... 3 mile looked covered but had open water spots....
532864,wee scot,2010-12-30 10:51:00,75,"Anyone have any updates on conditions ,i fish mainly around the windermere area thanksin advance"
532880,cityfisher,2010-12-30 13:47:00,959, +1 ill be in the area over the weekend
533016,wee scot,2010-12-30 23:04:00,75,look forward to hearing back from you cityfisher enjoy
533183,4x4bassin,2010-12-31 06:16:00,1025,By the looks of the noaa sat. pics. the Muskoka lakes look wide open and with this rain and mild weather it will still be awhile ! If i'm talking to my friend in Minet I will ask about the ice conditions for ya
533200,wee scot,2010-12-31 12:34:00,75,"That would be greatly appreciated 4x4 ,its a long drive for me to check ice"
533789,wee scot,2011-01-02 12:53:00,75,Any updates on the ice guys?
534639,4x4bassin,2011-01-04 17:06:00,1025,Got a message that the lake still has lots of open water and the ice that is there is not very good ! They received alot of rain on the weekend. I will try to keep ya posted on current conditions
534687,cityfisher,2011-01-04 20:11:00,959," I went for a walk on rousea and 45 mins of fishing on sunday afternoon, only 4 inches under me. Needs more time !"
534753,johnnyb,2011-01-04 23:26:00,3413,"I was fishing on WIndermere Bay on the weekend....a few huts out there....saw your buddy Sudsmaster....if you're reading this!  Only 4 inches...less in places....but didn't stop a guy from draggin his hut out to the middle of the lake with a snowmobile.  Blew my mind....but every time he went out, he made it back  Lots of action on the Lowrance...but the only takers were real tiny guys....not even picture worthy."
534835,gravyriggin',2011-01-05 03:08:00,10,"Glad to hear that Rosseau si starting to ice-up. Things up here are slowly cooling down, but no deep freeze to really make a lot of ice. Any word on Lake Muskoka? There's a couple of huts out on Couchiching in a number of areas, especially off Tudhope Park. Any info on the big lakse is appreciated.  Tight Lines GR"
