534418,Terry,2011-01-03 23:54:00,14456,yup I tested a bunch of alarm systems for the 10 digit dialing and they are good to go now .......
534419,misfish,2011-01-03 23:57:00,29133,"Does this mean if I call my son down the street,I have to dial 705 first?"
534423,kickingfrog,2011-01-04 00:15:00,8333, Only if you want to talk to him.
534425,Big Cliff,2011-01-04 00:19:00,6899,How many different combinations does that equal?
534444,mercman,2011-01-04 01:09:00,7054,"here i quebec,we been doing it for years now, and like anything else, ya get used to it.No big deal.They will give you a grace period of a couple of months.When you dial without the code, a recording will remind you to do it next time."
534447,bigugli,2011-01-04 01:13:00,6138,Been the same here in Southern Ontario for a long time.
534448,BillM,2011-01-04 01:18:00,17367,"Had this in Southern Ontario forever, when I moved to Barrie I still dialed 10 digits, lol.  No big deal."
534476,skeeter,2011-01-04 01:58:00,1907,with all the phones on the market these days they need to keep adding new area codes. when they run out of 3 digit area codes then it will be 4 digits. soon the area code will be longer then the phone number.
