534326,toca,2011-01-03 21:34:00,274,yeah kinda makes sense to buy a gas power auger.  cost the same if you run out buying a 28volt battery drill + adapter + auger  unless you alreay have one
534329,asdve23rveavwa,2011-01-03 21:42:00,2690, NICE!!!!!  AND they're giving a free case of beer with it!!
534347,misfish,2011-01-03 22:33:00,29133," Somethn work me nerves bye.  She came home and found it hidden in the BR.Came out and said,guess yer really getting back into fishing eh.  Naw dear,it,s for you.So is the heater in the truck and the two rods.  Bring on the whitie and laker grounds."
534348,toca,2011-01-03 22:35:00,274,hey brian you left out the angry glare she gave you. and the silent treatment
534350,misfish,2011-01-03 22:38:00,29133," Acually,she is very happy Im getting back out   Something about that joke,,,,,can you believe my husbands out fishing in this weather? Has me thinking though:unsure:"
534357,irishfield,2011-01-03 22:48:00,26272,Don't overthink it Brian.. just get out there and fish !
534375,misfish,2011-01-03 22:59:00,29133, Naw worries Wayne.Here fishy fishy.
534386,aplumma,2011-01-03 23:12:00,6896,Nice job Brian you should have told her it is a great way to plant flowers in the spring then it is a US toy instead of a MY toy. Now she is going shopping for cloths and shoes and you can't gripe about it.   Art
534426,vinnimon,2011-01-04 00:19:00,2593,  Very quitely go to ctc and pick up a protective cup before you end up
534438,fishnsled,2011-01-04 00:55:00,3520,Nice!!!!! You will enjoy having the power auger over the Sub Zero....damn Simcoe ice.  Terry - Best reply for 2011!
534441,Fishnwire,2011-01-04 01:04:00,983,"I went splits on a brand new Jiffy 8 inch STX Stealth last year.  It runs great and cuts like a dream.  Just today I picked up a Swede-bore 5 inch hand auger.  I cannot believe how easily it cuts.  It's like a lazer.  Less effort than using (let alone transporting) the Jiffy.  The obvious trade off is the dinky little 5 inch hole.  There may come a day when I regret it, but I'm fairly certain most fish (that I'm going to catch) will come up through a five inch hole.  My buddy's joke was that if we get a fish that won't fit, he'll grab a fillet knife and shove his hand down the hole up to his shoulder, then bring up slabs until it'll go."
534443,Guest gbfisher,2011-01-04 01:08:00,0,My God. Take it back!!! That will put you in an early grave. No one should have to drink Light Beer.   Nice Auger.
534479,Rattletrap2,2011-01-04 02:11:00,1652,"Brian, Just curious....but does it make it more difficult to walk properly when they get to be that big? I figure they must help prevent yer knees from knocking together in fear when She came into the house and found it?  Just like when you take a severe bump to the head....you should post on here every few hours....just so we know you are ok!!"
534483,fish_fishburn,2011-01-04 02:16:00,1311,Why don't you just put a straw in the fresh drilled hole you drill and drink that....same thing
534496,misfish,2011-01-04 02:35:00,29133,"Like I said,shes ok with the new drill,but if I can get her to stop banging me on the nugg,n everytime Canada scores,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"
534513,NAW,2011-01-04 03:07:00,4022,There ya go bri!!  I just got my Stikemaster perin' like  a kitten!  Cooks bay next weekend for some perch.  Can't wait till the lady freezes over!  Congrets on the new purchase.  Your shoulders will thank you later this season
534577,skeeter,2011-01-04 13:34:00,1907,"Has anyone heard from Brian today? do we need to call 911  if your still alive brian, then she's prolonging your death. one way or another you will pay !  hey is that a brand new merecedes suv sitting in your driveway with a sign on the windshield saying ""merry christmas to me"""
534586,aplumma,2011-01-04 13:54:00,6896, You could compromise and ask her to do it when the US team scores....less bumps   Art
534592,I'mHooked,2011-01-04 14:10:00,525,"I haven't had the cohones to share my Humminburd Ice 385ci purchase with my better half yet.  I thought they were going to be in short supply back in October.  I guess I'll just do what she does when something new shows up from her...""Oh don't be silly, I bought this last year...just haven't worn / used / displayed it yet!"" How can you be upset at something bought a year ago?  btw, nice case of beer!  Ohh ohh! great idea!...you drill 'em & I'll mark 'em! (...and drink the beer.  )"
534593,Fish Farmer,2011-01-04 14:11:00,2234, Kind of reminds me of the Capt. Morgan commercial
534217,misfish,2011-01-03 16:01:00,29133,"Anyone have this brand? and yer thoughts on them, verses the finbor 3  Thanks"
534224,Leecher,2011-01-03 16:11:00,7832,"Brian,  I have the 6"" Sub Zero and have no issues with it.... going on the 3rd year now and the blade is as sharp as the day I bought it  It cuts through ice like butter   Mind you I always keep the protective blade guard on it when moving around and make sure I don't bang it on the hard surface  Jacques"
534252,misfish,2011-01-03 17:59:00,29133, Yer word will do Jacques. Pick one up on the way home after work.Is it saturday yet??????
534253,Cookslav,2011-01-03 18:01:00,1457,"I have one as well Brian,  It works as it should, and I am in the same boat....3 years later and sharp as it came. Pretty good little unit especially for the price."
534267,misfish,2011-01-03 19:08:00,29133," Yeah,2/3rds the price as the fin.  On my way to get it now."
534269,Leecher,2011-01-03 19:13:00,7832, Can't go wrong price wise
534273,Terry,2011-01-03 19:25:00,14456,"they are real good but they don't work on simcoe ice as everyone knows simcoe ice is different. it has something to do with the molecular bond of the ice particles and that they bond on a 45 deg angle instead of vertically like other lakes, some people believe it's a magnetic anomaly from iron in the water or copper deposits but with the angle Sub Zero uses on their auges it binds in simcoe ice rendering them useless      "
534275,Leecher,2011-01-03 19:30:00,7832, 
534277,toca,2011-01-03 19:35:00,274, Thank God I Got A FinBore Then

534292,BillM,2011-01-03 20:09:00,17367,"Make sure if you aren't using it, you have the cover on it.  That's the biggest killer of ice augers.."

534301,asdve23rveavwa,2011-01-03 20:29:00,2690," Only one cure for that, Terry....more ICE FISHING!!!!"
534302,Leecher,2011-01-03 20:32:00,7832, Terry you need something to get your mind off things..... listen to this tune..... you'd be stupify  
534309,aplumma,2011-01-03 20:58:00,6896, Yup get out and stand with your back to the heater for awhile then lay on the ice. Call it medical treatment and write it off on your taxes.   Art
534312,misfish,2011-01-03 21:07:00,29133,"The wifes going to kill me,but I have a bad rotator cuff sooooooooooooooooooooooo   CHEBANG        "

534315,Terry,2011-01-03 21:12:00,14456,see he knew the Sub Zero wouldn't work  good choice   so are you in trouble for the auger or the beer
534317,irishfield,2011-01-03 21:16:00,26272,Should have bought Marty's collection before he wakes up and realizes what he's doing...
534322,skeeter,2011-01-03 21:23:00,1907,"If we dont hear from brian by 9 pm tonight, somebody better call 911  oh to be a fly on his wall tonight."
