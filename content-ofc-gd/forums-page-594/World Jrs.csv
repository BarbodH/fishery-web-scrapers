534648,JohnF,2011-01-04 17:53:00,3494," Our juniors remind me in a way of the Maple Leafs. You never know what team is going to appear. Of course they aren't as extreme in their ups & downs as the leafs. The team that beat the US sure wasn't the same team that lost to Sweden.  My wife made an interesting observation the other night. ""How many NHL teams have 18 first rounders on their current roster?"" I hadn't though of it in those terms but it really is an impressive stat.  JF"
534650,lookinforwalleye,2011-01-04 17:57:00,4399,The poor American team looked like a team full of Phil Kessel`s.  Sorry I could not resist!!!
534661,blaque,2011-01-04 18:53:00,2419,"your ""Ole Ole OLE OLE"" was WEAK, as was your ""Nah nah nah nah........hey hey......goodbye""  I think each chant went one verse before it fizzled out.  USA didnt even show last night..........shameful"
534690,Cookslav,2011-01-04 20:18:00,1457," Ya I agree 110%.  Last night they played better then any Canadian Junior team I've seen to date....they Simply owned the Yanks. I don't think the states played bad, I think they were just completely man handled, and shut down.  But where the heck was that physical domination the rest of the tourny? Little bit of ""Rope a Dope"" or what  All I know is if they play the Russians like that....it'll be a blow out. The Americans had a pretty solid Team with Depth, The Russians are more or less a line deep.  But like I said Earlier.... I didn't think our Boys had that kind of Game in them. I'll be bitting my nails tommorrow night."
534726,fish_fishburn,2011-01-04 21:55:00,1311,"That is an amazing stat. I really enjoyed the game last night. Team Canada is a big team and last night they were huge out there. Team Russia, has hot goaltending, and they are capable of scoring in bunches.  Don't under estimate them for a second. Personally..... I think they are shitting in their skates thinking about playing the Canucks. GO CANADA GO."
534365,Steve_R,2011-01-03 22:52:00,81,Sweden vs Russia...Wow what a good game going into overtime now..Tonights game should be even better. Lets go Canada!
534372,misfish,2011-01-03 22:56:00,29133, Sitting here watching the game.back and forth. Lets see if the sea of red takes over the seats tonight.
534381,bigugli,2011-01-03 23:06:00,6138,"Should be a great game, and I can't even have a pop while watching.   Danged bloodwork!!!!!!!!"
534382,JohnF,2011-01-03 23:09:00,3494, Russia goes to gold. Hopefully we get to play them.  JF
534388,misfish,2011-01-03 23:14:00,29133,"They need to change the format.IMO These shootouts in the semis is just silly.Two teams trying to get to gold and it,s decided by shootout? Play 5-5 or 4-4 whatever, but play the game."
534393,Steve_R,2011-01-03 23:19:00,81,I agree with you there...Should just play the game till someone scores
534395,Rod Caster,2011-01-03 23:20:00,5784,"Yup, shootouts in the Semi's is silly.  Go Visentin Go"
534410,kickingfrog,2011-01-03 23:36:00,8333,"I guess the Tre Kronor coach was right... too bad, I would have liked the rematch... now I hope Canada doesn't  get it."
534421,danbouck,2011-01-04 00:06:00,4380,The kids are ready to watch  
534428,misfish,2011-01-04 00:22:00,29133,"Crips Dan,I get nervous when my granddaughter swings her fav towel around my nascar collection. Hey kid,shoot the hole in the that 6 string."
534445,bigugli,2011-01-04 01:11:00,6138,WWOOOOOOOOW!!!  What a first period
534446,Dondorfish,2011-01-04 01:13:00,1000,One of the BEST periods of hockey that I have seen in a long long time!   Tracker (Don)
534452,BillM,2011-01-04 01:20:00,17367,"If Canada can keep up this pace, the US doesn't stand a chance.  Keep them slammed up against the boards and get their defense looking over their shoulders while going into the corners and it's over."
534455,Grimace,2011-01-04 01:22:00,2020,Pretty excellent hockey.
534456,danbouck,2011-01-04 01:23:00,4380," They love to jam with me and actually are very careful with them, plus I've treated them pretty bad around a camp fire with some wobbly pops"
534469,uglyfish,2011-01-04 01:46:00,981,what a great game!! USA is finally realizing that last year... was just a FLUKE!

534553,misfish,2011-01-04 11:02:00,29133,    Great game.Finaly some good goaltending aswell.
534569,Cookslav,2011-01-04 13:08:00,1457,"Gotta admit....didn't think they had it in them to beat the Americans, but I was hoping like hell. I had a LOT of fun sending an email to the American In laws...  That Pay back is a Awesome after last years loss"
534574,Grimace,2011-01-04 13:19:00,2020,"The Swedes did a lot of yapping about Canada.   Now the States are going to mop the floor with them.  Canucks gold, Ruskies silver, Yanks bronze."
534579,aplumma,2011-01-04 13:39:00,6896,Good game nice victory folks now it's time for me to root for Canada.     Art
