They decided it wasn't fair to make one of them stay with him the whole time, so they voted to take turns.   The first guy slept with Bob and comes to breakfast the next morning with his hair a mess and his eyes all bloodshot. They said, ""Man, what happened to you?"" He said, ""Bob snored so loudly, I just sat up and watched him all night.""   The next night it was a different guy's turn. In the morning, same thing  hair all standing up, eyes all bloodshot. They said, ""Man, what happened  to you?  You look awful!"" He said, 'Man, that Bob shakes the roof with his snoring. I watched him all night.""   The third night was Fred's turn. Fred was a tanned, older cowboy; a man's  man. The next morning he came to breakfast bright-eyed and  bushy-tailed.  ""Good  morning!"" he said. They couldn't believe it. They said, ""Man, what happened?""  He said, ""Well, we got ready for bed. I went and tucked Bob into bed, patted him on the butt, and kissed him goodnight.  Bob sat up and watched me all night."
