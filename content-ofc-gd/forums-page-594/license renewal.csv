534454,SBCregal,2011-01-04 01:21:00,688,"thanks for the replies guys  we went this morning to renew licenses, when she pulled out her temporary license, you couldnt read most of the info on it, including the card number.  it looks like a call to the service ontario people tomorrow to see what we have to do to get a new card sent out.  it'll suck if we have to  pay for another card after not receiving the one she paid for last year.  we ended up grabbing a one day resident license for her and headed off to find some ice.  we got to st williams and saw nobody out and dont know the area...didnt want to risk anything.  drove around to the old cut and same deal...turned around and went home  next weekend we'll be out, hopefully we can get some answers by then   ryan"
