Evinrude Launches Winter Retail Promotion  BRP launches a new retail incentive promotion for its Evinrude outboard engines brand today. The new program, “Season’s BEST Boat Show Sales Event,” offers participating Evinrude dealers an aggressive sales closing tool designed to deliver added peace of mind for boat show shoppers.  Qualified Evinrude E-TEC purchases between January 1, 2011 and April 15, 2011 receive a FREE 5-year factory backed limited warranty (3-year BRP factory warranty PLUS an additional 2 years B.E.S.T. coverage). In addition, if a consumer repowers their existing boat with a qualifying Evinrude E-TEC engine between January 1, 2011 and April 15, 2011, they will receive up to an $800 discount off rigging equipment – which means additional retail savings.  “We want to continue offering our dealers effective retail programs to drive dealer traffic,” stated Christopher Berg, Director of Marketing and Strategic Planning for Evinrude. “This latest retail offer will give our dealers the necessary selling incentives to boost retail activity at the upcoming boat shows,” he concluded.  The new retail program is supported by a full print and on-line advertising and media campaign. Dealers are provided a complete package of point-of-purchase materials to advertise the promotion on the showroom floor and at boat shows with no dealer contribution required.  BRP's Evinrude E-TEC engine line-up now includes 98 engine models from 15 to 300 horsepower. All engines are available at Evinrude dealerships worldwide. For full details and conditions about this promotion, consumers should visit an authorized, participating Evinrude dealer or www.evinrude.com."
