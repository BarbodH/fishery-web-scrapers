They seem pretty pricey but mite be worth it to my fishing partner and I as we go on a 15 day fishing trip in Shinning Tree area every July. Have managed to get ice to last 11 - 12 days by burying coolers in sand up to their lids but 12 days is limit. Wonder if these coolers are that much better."

They are pretty pricey but they seem really well built and have a ton of insulation in them. The insulation is something like 2 or 3 inches so keep that in mind when looking at the dimentions if you end up looking to buy one.
