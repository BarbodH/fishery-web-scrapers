534647,chessy,2011-01-04 17:51:00,610,i just came back from virginia and it is a snap to do .. go to the store and buy licence   36 bucks for a year of freshwater fishing... if you loose your lic . you go on line and print a new one .. and ever deer turkey or bear that is shot is checked in via the phone or a check station . they know how many deer were shot and in what county ... there system is far far supioror than ours
534659,irishfield,2011-01-04 18:48:00,26272,"Another Government program privatized... price should go down by letting someone that knows what they are doing run it, but you watch it will go up!  Gee.. I wonder if I'll be able to actually use on-line licencing now and it will know what to do with an apostrophe..."
534672,Big Cliff,2011-01-04 19:31:00,6899,"Oh sure, it figures, now that i don't need a fishing license, they make it easier to get."
534698,POLLIWOGG,2011-01-04 20:46:00,835,"We caught the Americans spying on us for credit card #'s on our politicians thanks to wikileaks so we go and give them the card #'s of everyone that gets an outdoor card  in Ontario with a credit card. That should make it easier and less embarrassing for them  .  Irish, I think the program was privatized way back when they introduced the outdoor card, they're just changing co. Isn't that why you can't get a license at the mnr."
534895,Aaron Shirley,2011-01-05 14:41:00,655,It's about time Ontario got out of the stone age with fishing licence purchasing. They are definitely behind the times.  I don't blame the OMNR with a severe lack of manpower and proper funding. My wife purchased a fishing licence at CTC early last year and didn't get her card until about November. Brutal. Hopefully things will continue to improve with the new system.
