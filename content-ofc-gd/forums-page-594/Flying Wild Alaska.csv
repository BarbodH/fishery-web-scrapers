532408,blaque,2010-12-28 21:12:00,2419,"So...........yet another discovery reality series is about to air the beginning of january and i cant wait LOL  Im sure most of you discovery channel buffs have already seen the previews. This one looks to be a bit less staged but who ever knows.  It looks like its going to grab me once im in to the first episode. I dont need any other channels besides discovery and my hockey feeds lol. Maybe the history channel so i can catch Pawn Stars.  Irish, you should get a kick out of this latest series starting next week.  I can now add to my list of shows:  Pawn Stars Pickers Deadliest Catch American Choppers Ice Road Truckers (""bunch of wimps"" lol)  And now  Flying Wild Alaska"
532418,danc,2010-12-28 21:53:00,4677,You missed the best one of all. Sarah Palin's Alaska.
532420,Governator,2010-12-28 21:55:00,879,American Choppers... really?  Pawn Stars and Ice Road Truckers though are pretty addictive.
532421,irishfield,2010-12-28 21:56:00,26272,"  Yah.. LOL... ""we hunt to survive up here""! ($45,000/pound was the cost of her caribou hunt!)"
532433,DRIFTER_016,2010-12-28 22:56:00,10439,I'm looking forward to this one as well. The daughters look smokin'!!!!
532449,Billy Bob,2010-12-28 23:38:00,5865, I like Sarah as she down to earth.
532452,Roy,2010-12-28 23:52:00,13728, Hard for her to be anywhere else. She spends a lot of time on her back.
532484,blaque,2010-12-29 01:28:00,2419," Yup........sorry, What can i say.  Also forgot to mention Gold Rush which i just caught an episode of last night and it should be pretty entertaining.  On the bill tonite however will be watching the Sabres lose again out west.  You leafs fans better keep your head up...........your about to see a big Buffalo falling down the ladder right at you"
532506,PikeMolester,2010-12-29 02:42:00,428,you need to chek out GOLD RUSH ALASKA!
532511,BUSTER,2010-12-29 02:52:00,1336,American pickers and I can't wait for the return of ice road rick in the dangerous drives. that freak cracks me up
532580,blaque,2010-12-29 16:46:00,2419," Ya i mentioned them late in the thread. Saw part of an episode the other day and it looked pretty good.  ""Your all millionaires......only thing is ya gotta get it outta the ground""  Swamp loggers is ok at times also  Oh and buffalo beat edmonton last night.....we can now go on another 4 game skid  LOVE the gretzky era oiler jerseys they had on last night, i dont get to see edmonton too often so i dunno if they brought them back for good or if it is one of their alternate jerseys"
532589,Billy Bob,2010-12-29 17:09:00,5865,"Swamp People with ""Troy"" being the man when it comes to gator fishing."
532788,BUSTER,2010-12-30 01:36:00,1336,"HOLY MOLY,  JUST WATCHING EXTREME COUPONING  spend 1175.00 minus coupons 6 bucks spend 600.00 minus coupons $2.50  now thats coupon shopping!"
532818,Marko,2010-12-30 02:56:00,854, Funny you mentioning this show....my gf was just watching it and I sat down and watched first few minutes of it. People like that make people like me feel normal again hahaa....lady had enough toilet paper stashed up for the next 30 or 40 years. Funny she was telling her husband that he needs to move his tv out of the room so she can put some more crap in it hahah.  After 5 minutes i left...couldn't really handle it.
532820,Marko,2010-12-30 02:58:00,854, If you get a chance check out River Monsters. Its pretty much the only fishing show i watch these days.
534229,blaque,2011-01-03 16:28:00,2419," Yep , another good one.  However.........anyone see the one where he was intentionally lining salmon. He actually described how he was trying to hook the fish by lining them. Found that peculiar.  He only ended up hooking one fish and had it stolen by a brown bear after beaching it."
534276,DRIFTER_016,2011-01-03 19:35:00,10439," Lining is an accepted practice when fishing for sockeye salmon in Alaska (probably other places too) as they are plankton eaters and do not readily take bait,lure or fly like the other 4 species of pacific salmon do. Personally I don't like it but it is accepted."
534344,blaque,2011-01-03 22:20:00,2419, Interesting........i almost figured that had to be the case.  Thanks for clarifying.  He also had a monster of a pistol with him (well his chaperone did) that fired a bullet in the air to fend off the brown bears that were lurking.
534359,DRIFTER_016,2011-01-03 22:49:00,10439,  There's nothing spookier than running into a 1000# brownie face to face at close quarters. It's pretty exhilarating when the fear wears off though. Don't ask me how I know this.
