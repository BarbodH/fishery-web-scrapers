Problem is I've never been to the area, I guess we're staying right on a lake near town (don't know which one yet) so I'm wondering if anyone has some tips for the area.  Anyone know what the conditions are like?  Any good tackle shops?"
533859,brandon,2011-01-02 17:05:00,857,"I was just up there for a week and the conditions were getting worse and worse as the week went on due to the warm weather.  Fishing was a bit slow but we still managed a few pike.  I'm not sure how conditions are now but the lakes were getting quite slushy.  As far as tackle shops go, there's a small bait shop in Kirkland and also a Canadian Tire.  Larder Lake has a decent tackle/bait shop at the gas station in town.  All our pike were caught in 8-20 FOW on shiners."

533906,tilly,2011-01-02 19:34:00,32,Ok thanks for the help guys!  What was the avg. ice thickness?   As soon as I know I'll shoot you a PM. Cheers

It is about a 30 minute drive from town.  Most of the lakes have either Brook Trout or Splake in them and can be good fishing.  Unless you want to walk 5 or 6 kms you will need the ATV or snowmobile to get in.  The MNR stocking list should give you an idea of what is in what lake.  The Trial was broken three weeks ago when I was in there.  As far as tackle shops your best to buy anything you need before you get there as the selection will not be great there.
