534823,splashhopper,2011-01-05 02:37:00,2931,"I know of two long wide slow deep rivers that i loved fishing for pike and bass this summer.  I have not driven up there in the winter,   but want to.  My plan is take a probing pole ( steel) and test the ice in the stretches that i know are deep and slow .  If they are safe enough to go out on, I will try for some pike...  Any thoughts or suggestions?"
