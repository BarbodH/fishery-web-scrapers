Stared out about 300 yds from shore and started to spank'em right away. Fished that area for an hour or so, then decided to move out farther hoping for some bigger fish. The fish didn't really get any bigger, but the bite was steady and the Perch were cooperative! Total for the day was as follows; HH -144 and two Herring! Tom 100 and two Herring Rubin - 60 and two Herring Pete - 55 and three Herring All Herring were immediately released!  Hot bait again was the Berkely Grub on a jiggin Rap... blue and silver or Firetiger... Ended up taking home about 20 in total... still a dink fest, but lots of fun! Ice was anywhere from 4 inches to 7 inches, depending on where we were... the four inches we fished was solid black ice... you could see the Herring fighting 10 feet below the whole, through the ice.  Waiting for the main lake to freeze up so we can multi-species fish.  So, I've been out twice on Cook's in the past week and have personally landed over 300 perch... and between the two groups I've been with, we have landed well into the 1000 perch range! It's a ton of fun and I highly recommend getting out while they remain cooperative! HH"

534615,Headhunter,2011-01-04 15:00:00,5703,"Yah, you're right, Cook's Bay Perch do look so much different from any other Perch! LMAO And if you were twice your current size, you'd still be half the size of Mike!!!! HH"
534618,Terry,2011-01-04 15:19:00,14456,nice going  you need a sign that says  My names Not Lloyd  I don't think he has ever caught a perch..........

534646,Joey,2011-01-04 17:41:00,9122,"That's awesome Joe, how to beat those perch"
534654,Headhunter,2011-01-04 18:17:00,5703,"Chris, firstly, as you well know, not everyone can get away with wearing those shirts... If you really really NEED to get one, head to you local Double V. They can be had for as little as $5.00, but you will have to answer a skill testing question!!!! Thanks Joey... it sure is a lot of fun catching fish non stop, regardless of their size! It's a time of year I look forward to every year! HH"
534662,Spiel,2011-01-04 18:54:00,9065," I was hoping that if I mentioned it enough you might see your way to giving me one of your's, already broken in and proven, you know the ones that don't fit you anymore."
534665,Headhunter,2011-01-04 19:11:00,5703,What! And just hand over all that hard won fish catching karma!?! HH
