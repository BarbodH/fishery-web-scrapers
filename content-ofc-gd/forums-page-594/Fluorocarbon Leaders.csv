534860,solopaddler,2011-01-05 05:20:00,8605," Absolutely. However,my statements, strong as they may be, are based on thousands of hours on the water. I've never been one to follow fads or trends.  Anyhow what I do know to be indisputably true, reading the water effectively and proper presentation are far more important factors to success than brand of line.  Some of the best anglers I know have the crappiest tackle...but they've got the touch.  I think most people give fish waaay too much credit anyway, they're generally pretty predictable as most creatures of instinct are."
534863,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2011-01-05 05:46:00,0,"i use fluoro for a few applications but the fluoro explosion is ridiculous, especially in terms of main line (anybody else still use xl for their spinning gear?).  when i was a teen i used to scour fishing mags, watch all the fishing shows saturday and sunday mornings on tnn, and drool over the latest gear... eventually i realized that the fishing biz, like any biz, must constantly reinvent itself to remain relevant and profitable.  fishing reminds us of things like this every time we bring out a friend, girlfriend, or child with minimal experience and get outfished by them using a closed faced reel and a worm on a jighead."
534938,OhioFisherman,2011-01-05 16:29:00,6623,"""closed faced reel and a worm on a jighead."" LOL actually my preferred method most of the time, for one simple reason, if you can locate the fish it works. Too many fall for the hype of the latest products."
535082,SRT8 smoker craft,2011-01-05 23:24:00,1107," Exactly how I have developed my stance on flouro and I have been using the same 13' floatrod for over 10 years now nad it would prolly be considered crappy tackle to most the gear heads and tackle junkies,but it landed me well over 100 Lake Erie chromers this fall all on trilene 6lb flouro. it's the same reason they make a zillion different reels and rods ect,ect everyone has a different way of doing things a couple people have said vanish is crap, I love it never had a problem with it but I have only used it for smallies and 8lb+."
534094,ChrisK,2011-01-03 02:24:00,2772,Sounds like the boys out there are traditional fly fisherman. Seems like a lot of that is going around these days even here in the Huron tribs I fish. I see more and more guys walking the river lately with fly rods in hand. I also use a center pin and offer up flies to the steel here but slightly different patterns mostly in black or purple stonefly. Ive been debating for awhile now to go with the fly rod but its a big step and its going to take some major commitment.
534095,OhioFisherman,2011-01-03 02:35:00,6623,"Limited experience with Fluoro, Vanish only and only 8-10#, allegedly the right thing to do under tough, clear water conditions. My personal results never showed it to be a noticeable improvement, on tough days fishing was tough no matter what you did.  Fishing Lake Erie it got beat up by Zebra mussels, but so did everything else. Leader I used were steel, twist weld, never had an issue with it, east to make up even in the boat, as long as the wind wasn`t howling. Budget leaders usually have poor quality components = lost fish-lures."
534097,Cookslav,2011-01-03 02:38:00,1457,"I used the 6lb P-line flourocarbon for a Main line, on my light action spinning gear when spring fishing for Specs. It was flawless in one application....low stretch. Hook sets were perfect on long casts, and trolling, and In truth I did notice a significant difference. BUT....I had serious issues with memory It prcatically coiled off the reel when it was cold. Since then(3 years ago) they seem to have fixed that issue, as its been good to me.  I can't say I have a distain for Mono, but given the choice...in this specific application for now I'll stick with P-line."
534101,SRT8 smoker craft,2011-01-03 02:45:00,1107, When you put new flouro on your reel take off the spool and run it under hot water for a few mins I have never done it but my bass tourny partner does and it work great for him no explosions that I have seen using straight 10 trilene flouro give it a shot can't hurt nothing.He got the tip from a tackle wholesaler and bass pro.

534144,solopaddler,2011-01-03 11:16:00,8605, Pretty much.  Just because everyone is on the bandwagon doesn't make it right.    Apples and oranges for sure. No way no how the lighter pound test fluoro's are as abrasion resistant as the heavy stuff used for musky leaders.
534146,Garnet,2011-01-03 11:19:00,2056,Lets see you are having problems with your split shot fraying flouro.  Shouldn't you look at the type of split shot and your method of pinching your shot.  With poppers for smallies a short 2ft flouro leader will help keep the nose pointed downward without sinking allowing you to use your bait just a little more aggressively and a little rougher water.
534152,solopaddler,2011-01-03 12:20:00,8605," I addressed this issue many years ago but still, if you're moving shot around on your line you'll bruise it. The question is how much.  The softest shot on the market is plain old Water Gremlin. Much softer than the round shot marketed to the steelheading fraternity.  My only issue with the round gremlin shot is its brightness.  Soak it in liquid drano for a bit and it turns jet black."
534157,Raf,2011-01-03 13:22:00,3495," I also use stuff as light as 8, 15lb for trout trolling and ice fishing and it's also superior to mono.  I don't however, have any experience with the really light stuff steelheaders would use."
534158,Garnet,2011-01-03 13:41:00,2056,Yes that's what I use and being very careful to pinching the front shut and keeping the leader to the back. Also adjust shot inline with leader.  And shame of all shames I use winged slit shot because my test were inconclusive on the spinning issue and losing that a justifiability didn't compensate.
534162,ChrisK,2011-01-03 13:58:00,2772,"Raf, That seems to be the real division point between yea and nea. Seems the heavier stuff is rock solid but the lighter steelhead stuff doesn't have such a good following. Always boils down to personal preference. Me, I had a great fall season landing over 60 bows.High percentage of those fish were caught on,you guessed it,fluoro. Never had a brake off due to nics and abrasions,why..Cause I check my tippets for wear and tear between fish and or rubs on boulders and sometimes timber. However,I did loose two fish.The first was a big fresh rainbow. Took my fly and belined it straight into the timber on the other side of the river. I tried to slow him down to no avail,broke me off at the knot. Second fish same thing exept this time it went aerial right before the timber and landed on the other side of the downed tree and then threaded its way back under back into the pool and broke my main line 8lb suffix mono...go figure ! So really this is all personal preference going on here. I tried fluoro,it works for me only cause I like the 6lb 4x fine diameter. I realize I can pull out my Maxima and have that same diameter but I would be reducing to 3lb to 4lb to get that so this double edged sword always seems to be the kicker."
534164,Raf,2011-01-03 14:00:00,3495,just to be clear.. this is what i am talking about. typically a 25 yd spool that costs a fair bit.  i still think some of you are talking about using fluoro mainline (which i've found to be worthless) as leader material which is a different animal than leader specific material.  
534165,Raf,2011-01-03 14:02:00,3495,perhaps you're right Chris.  like I said before I've not tried anything less than 8lb.
534166,ChrisK,2011-01-03 14:06:00,2772," Some guys are Raf, Some are loading up there spools,some guys are using a section at the end of there main line for casting baits and others like myself are using the lighter stuff like like Frog Hair and Scientific Angler for fly fishing and float fishing..."
534167,ChrisK,2011-01-03 14:08:00,2772,"Raf,What are you using it for ?? I mean what type of fishing ?"
534170,craigdritchie,2011-01-03 14:12:00,1586,I remember my first experiences with Vanish. The only thing that 'Vanished' were about 90 percent of the fish I hooked. I couldn't strip that crap off my reel fast enough.
534172,Raf,2011-01-03 14:15:00,3495,"the 8-15-20lb i use for ice fishing lakers, jigging walleye in the spring, long lines and dipsys for trout in the spring.  the heavier stuff for pike & musky."
534175,ChrisK,2011-01-03 14:19:00,2772,"Ok,now I remember,you did mention that up in the thread somewhere already,sorry. So once again the heavier application is the ticket then. This really seems to be the pattern here. Like you said though,your not spooling up with the stuff but rather using a section at the end of your main line..."
534254,Cookslav,2011-01-03 18:18:00,1457,"I'll second Berkley Vanish as garbage....way to many break offs, memory issues, and knot strength was a huge issue. Thats what got me to try the P-line in the first place, and I'm talking Main line.  But specificly light spinning tackle. When I was a Mono guy I'd use 4lb test on my Spring Algonquin trips, but as fate would have it, the day before I left I went to spool up, and the lowest test available was 6lb so I gave it a whirl....we knocked 'em dead so My confidence was re-established on 6lb.  But like I said it had significant memory issues in the cold, however that seems to have been addressed as since then I've had no issues. I can't say 've had any abrasion issues however, like Chris I am also pretty anal about nicks... I regularily check, and re-tie at the slightest imperfection.  However that being said.... I agree that Flouro in lighter lb tests is NOT more abrassion resistant. The way I'm fishing this line...I'm in the wood, or on the edge constantly, and I have found that I am re-tieing more often.  I have not had a break off to date with the stuff, but I do beleive it to scratch easier if that makes sense???? It simply gets dinged up easier, but I honestly have no idea if its strength is compramised more so then Mono, as I simply re-tie before I find out?  All I do know is the hook sets are better at a distance, and I beleive the overall strength to be be better. And in clear spring waters of Algonquin, I find the line to be stellar.  In a pinch I've used it as Tippet on the Fly rod, but I can't say that i've seen any pro's or cons?"
534256,TennesseeGuy,2011-01-03 18:25:00,957,"Hey Guys, thanks for all the responses.  You've given me lots to think about.  I've been using Seaguar Fluorocarbon Leader Material, 130# test.  Use it only for leaders when pike fishing.  I've never used fluorocarbon line and don't intend to, especially after reading your posts on this thread.  I've used it for 6 years without a mishap.  Probably my weakest point is in crimping the double barrel sleeves.  I try to be easy on it, but usually go with an extra squeeze before attaching the lure.  Thanks, TG"
534466,SRT8 smoker craft,2011-01-04 01:44:00,1107, And just because YOU say it's crap doesn't make it so
534651,OhioFisherman,2011-01-04 18:01:00,6623," I really never had those problems with it, but if I felt the slightest nick in my line I would cut it and retie. A keeper sometimes could mean money or not, I always hated losing fish."
534655,Headhunter,2011-01-04 18:40:00,5703,"I've been filling my spinning reels with Seaguar Floro for a couple of years. I really like it. Now, many of you guys have a reel for each and every application you use. I have two spinning reels that get the lion's share of use, for any and all applications. I use the same reel to jig Pickereyes as I do for jiggin Whities on Simcoe. So far the line has been flawless. I find it easy to spool, easy tie knots and I also like the fact that it stretches less and makes my hook sets in deep Whitie land solid. Heck, two winters ago, I used it up at Waynes place, sitting outside in minus 32 degree weather (not including wind chill) and it was flawless. Never had a problem with it. Yah, it's more expensive than mono, but to me it's worth it... to some of you guys who carry multiple rods, it can get scarey expensive. I am not a fan of braid and I am not a fan of tying leaders as that time is time that I should be fishing, not tying. No, I don't fish spotted carp (Trout) so I can't speak from that perspective, but I do like the Floro I have used so far. HH"

533943,ChrisK,2011-01-02 20:29:00,2772,"My bad,we were talking about line abrasion and somehow I made a connection with controlling a hard fighting fish out of harms way of abrasive situations. Typical self consumed steelheader"
533950,solopaddler,2011-01-02 20:46:00,8605," Fluoro is absolutely not more abrasion resistant than mono especially in a steelhead tippet application.  Fluoro by its very nature will become weak if nicked or bruised. Something that happens regularly as personally I usually always have at least some dust shot clamped onto my tippet.  If you move them around, (which I do constantly do when steelheading) a fluoro tippet will become weakened.  Mono, especially maxima ultragreen will not. I've fished with ultragreen tippet that felt like a cheese grater was run across it and it still maintains an amazing amount of strength.  Fluoro similarily shredded will snap instantly.  In any case fluoro does have certain properties that are different from mono, the main one being it sinks faster. Unfortunately this is not an advantage the way I fish it.  I flat out do not believe it's more invisible to fish than a clear mono of similar diameter.  For those of you who use it exclusively, more power to you. Personally I'd rather spend my money on something other than a 10-15 dollar 30m spool of line that imo is essentially nothing more than a crutch."
533978,craigdritchie,2011-01-02 21:52:00,1586,"Fluorocarbon is one of those funny things in fishing. I think if a person really believes in it, they will catch more fish. Not because of the fluorocarbon per se, but because the person feels more confident when using it. That, in turn, means they will fish more effectively, and pay closer attention to every little thing they do. That is what catches more fish.  I love fishing for smallmouth bass with topwaters, and my favourite topwater of all is a particular colour of Rebel Pop-R. It's the standard white bait in G-Finish, with a light blue back. I also use Pop-Rs that are white all over, without the blue back, but they don't work nearly as well. That obviously makes no sense at all, since - if you think about it - the fish can't see the lure's back and have no idea if it is blue or not. It's entirely in my head. I know this. Yet, to this day, I catch more fish on the ones with the blue back than on the plain all-white ones. It's just me. Something about the pretty paint job on the ones with the blue backs just inspires me to pay closer attention, and as a result, I fish more effectively and catch more fish on them. Crazy, but true, and I think fluorocarbon is no different.  Where fluoro is concerned, I personally hate the stuff. In my experience it's fragile, it frays like crazy and is even less durable in cold weather - exactly when I would appreciate having a little edge. Thanks, but I'll stick to mono, which is expensive enough as it is.  But if it works for you, then go nuts! Everyone has their own little confidence items .... for many, fluoro may be it."
533981,solopaddler,2011-01-02 22:04:00,8605, Exactly.
533984,dave524,2011-01-02 22:16:00,4508," My sentiments as far as steelheading as virtually the same as Solo's. The biggest thing though that turned me off fluoro after trying it for a steelhead leader was flucuating knot strength. Ok , I might knot have been using the latest fluoro approved knots but any plus I got in strength for diameter was nullified by the knot strength and let me assure you that we push the breaking strength of a leader to the utmost only saved in the most part by long shock absorber rods. I too will stick to Maxima or my usual Trilene XT in a similar green. Still moan the fact they apparently discontinued 2 lb. XT, really tested out at a good 4 lb. if truth be known."
533996,tributaryhunter,2011-01-02 23:00:00,108,"sometimes fluro makes a huge difference, niagara i usually use anywhere from 6 to 10lb fluoro depending on clarity, whirlpool in the spring i use 5 to 8lb, small tribs 3 to 6lb, medium to large rivers 5.6lb to 8lb, in darker water u can get away with 6lb green maxima for a leader."

It definitely takes a beating compared to the flouro from what I've seen.  One little nick in flouro and it's over, mono takes a beating especially for how cheap it is.  I like to use flouro when jigging for whities and lakers in the winter as a lead (3-4ft with a micro swivel to 6lb Fireline Crystal).   If I'm tossing big muskie baits for the toothy critters, it's 100-130lb flouro leads for sure, those lures are to expensive to lose"
534031,solopaddler,2011-01-03 00:25:00,8605," I know that's what you do Billy, but have you ever tried without fluoro?  Next time we get out let's do a little test."
534037,Guest gbfisher,2011-01-03 00:34:00,0,"I've tried 30lb fluoro(two types)for tieing pickerel harnesses against 30lb Trilene XT. The XT would last for twice as many fish, with incidental Pike in between. The fluoro snap offs were always a treat  . I'm guessing the little stretch of the mono is what helps in some cases."
534038,solopaddler,2011-01-03 00:35:00,8605," The most pertinent info from that article discusses fluorocarbon's ""invisibility"" compared to mono. The supposed invisibility is what drives it's sales.  This is copied and pasted from the article:  ""Conclusions from our visibility tests? We'd say largely inconclusive. For one, it's difficult to determine if what we see is the same as what a fish can see. From our photographs, it would certainly appear that some of the lines are difficult to find, but then again, so is the Berkley Trilene XL! What's more, how important is line visibility over, say, line diameter? The larger the diameter of your line, the greater disturbance it will create in the water and the easier it will be for a fish to sense this disturbance through its lateral line. In that case, visibility is really a moot point. Once again, too many variables to consider to truly develop a viable conclusion.""  So basically to the human eye clear Trilene XL is just as invisible. Hmmm..what a shock.  In any case it's impossible to know exactly what a fish is seeing so how can any company possibly claim their line is nearly invisible to fish? LOL!  For me results on the water are the only clear indicator. The thousands of steelhead landed on mono tippet in glass water clear water speak for themselves.  Learning how to read water and presenting your offering properly are infinitely more important factors to success."
534043,Garry2Rs,2011-01-03 00:58:00,1425,"I want to congratulate you-guys on a very informative, calm and rational discussion.  I have seen this topic quickly degenerate into brawl on some fishing boards.  I think we have pretty well established that with few exceptions, mono is just as good as fluoro at 25% of the cost. In some cases maybe mono is even better!  One thing I especially liked was the in-put from Steelheaders, because they face super clear water and fish that are known to be spooky.  Personally, I will continue to use short fluoro and mono leaders on my braid, depending on whether I want the bait to dive or float."
534045,BillM,2011-01-03 01:06:00,17367," I think the big thing is having confidence, especially when steelheading.  That's one thing I still struggle with.

534048,ChrisK,2011-01-03 01:15:00,2772,"Garry, Your totally correct by stating that the steelheaders are more put up to the task when it comes to using or not using flouro's. Personally I think the spooky highly lethargic steelhead is overated and made up by anglers that have troubles hooking up with them . Like the muskie,a fish of a thousand casts, I think not. If you put yourself in the right place at the right time delivering the right presentation you can catch these steelhead with or without flourocarbon.

And when I say gin clear, I'm talking about water more clear than anything I've fished previously.  As a results I've been playing around even more between mono and fluoro leaders for Bull Trout and I personally have found no difference in the hook up rate, even on slow days.  What I can say for sure is that I have much more confidence in the strength of my leader when it's mono vs the equivalent fluoro. I too find fluoro to be substantially more sensitive to nicks and scuffs."

I have tested 6lb mono against 6lb flouro and mono breaks WAY easier every time trilene against trilene. Like I said before stop buying the over priced ""tippet"" materiel and try trilene flouro it is stronger than any 6lb mono and I am certain of that! I have broken my 12lb trilene xl mainline trying to break off a snag(Obviously a fray in the line) .As for all the comments about getting a knick in the flouro and your done, I have used the trilene flouro all day with out re tying my leader and moved my bb shot all over the place without any problem and the line is frayed like crazy .I will say it again deferent people have diferent recipes for success and telling  my recipe doesn't work is pretty arrogant  or maybe I'm just not very abrasion resistant LOL"
534079,Jet,2011-01-03 02:05:00,364," Where I live, I'm the only centerpin fisherman and even float setup fisherman I've seen. Even the guides I know don't ever see any. Kinda of weird I thought since John Milner makes his famous pins just 20 mins away from me.  So fly fishing is the dominant method here. Fly baits are the usual for small trout, bigger ones like bull trout streamers and clousers are the top flies.  For float fishing I use roe when allowed though haven't had much luck on it. So I float streamers, clousers, bucktails and wolly buggers with good success for Bull Trout. Tried many others like Steelhead jigs but they haven't worked well for me. Pink worms really call the Cutthroats."

Too many times have I switched to a small 3 # tippet after the morning bite has stopped and it has acounted for a couple more fish. Spooky smallies will also hit a light diameter flouro over mono. Other times I use a 65 # braid straight to a jig and the fish dont seem to care, even in the clearest of water. I think that flouro has its time and place. Just not all the time. Good debate guys"

I use them, however mine stayed dry all but 9 days this past fishing season.  My sample is short. TG"
533811,lew,2011-01-02 14:24:00,12766,"I use 130# Seagar fluoro for muskies because it doesn't kink like wire leaders.  I used wire for years and the best I ever found were Stringeze, but they would often kink when a musky thrashed  and at around $6.00 each it would get expensive, cause once a wire leader is kinked I won't use it again. If you have a good day and catch several fish and each one ruins a leader it gets kinda spendy.  I think the softer fluoro is easier on a musky too when she rolls in the line as it doesn't cut into the flesh the way wire does sometimes.  Thats just my opinion though...."
533814,Raf,2011-01-02 14:34:00,3495,"What Lew said re: muskie.  To add, we also use them for trolling trout in the spring.  After dozens of fish the lines take a beating, we'll also bang bottom with dipsys and that takes a toll on leaders too.  Fluoro takes the beating much better than mono.  Less time retying = more fish in the boat."
533824,MCTFisher9120,2011-01-02 14:58:00,3761,"This is on the lite side of leaders for toothy fish but my 15lb Trilene Fluoro seems to hold fine to average size pike. I use it as a main line, useually for spinnerbaits and spoons and never break off. Might up to 17lb Fluoro this season but I'm fine with straight fluoro rather than braid/fluoro lead."
533826,outllaw,2011-01-02 15:14:00,1232,over priced and overrated. enuff said from a musky troller
533827,Mike Pike,2011-01-02 15:15:00,1332,"I use Seaguar's 6lb flurocarbon leader material when fishing trout on the Niagara.  I'm just amazed the way this stuff can be raked along the teeth of a bow or brown during the fight and still not break.  The invisability of the line is incredible too cuz even with my glasses on, it's still hard to see!  lol  I hate fishing without it now cuz I feel it puts me at a disadvantage.  It seems like I never have enough time to fish so when I DO get out, I want all the odds in my favour."
533830,asdve23rveavwa,2011-01-02 15:39:00,2690,"I agree with the facts that they kink less, and, definitely stand up to alot of abuse.  As for the invisibility factor, didn't notice a huge advantage this past season, but, still doing my own comparisons."
533837,solopaddler,2011-01-02 15:59:00,8605,"My thoughts are more based on the use of fluoro tippet for steelhead, and as tippet in conjunction with braid for walleye and bass.  I have found absolutely no difference in the amount of hookups using fluoro compared to a similar diameter (that's the key) clear mono.  In some instances where the water has a green tinge a green coloured mono like maxima ultragreen seems to work much better than either fluoro or clear mono.  As far as musky/pike leaders go I like using them only 'cause they're easier on the fish and give many lures better action easpecially when casting.  IMO the hype over fluoro drives its sales and use, not what it can actually do."
533838,mercman,2011-01-02 16:03:00,7054,"Keep em comin` guys.I`m learning from every post One question. Is flouro really invisible to the fish,and are they really smart enough to figure it out."
533840,Roy,2011-01-02 16:08:00,13728, Almost verbatim what I would have answered. I could go further but it might cause trouble.
533844,cwpowell,2011-01-02 16:19:00,265,Went trout fishing this past summer with two rods. One loaded with 4lb mono the other loaded with 4lb fluoro. The fluoro rod definitely outfished the mono rod. I don't know if this was just coincidence or if the fluoro helped. But Iknow I definitely won't be trout fishing without fluoro anymore...
533857,aplumma,2011-01-02 16:53:00,6896,Thanks Solopaddler for the info. down here it is very rare that we use any type of leaders. We have very few clear water places around here and the only time I put a leader on is when I am fishing braid and then it is only a piece of mono. Up North I use Braid and tied directly to my pike lures and I do not see any sign of shying away from the lure. I however find my bass catch seems to go up with a mono leader. Is the aggressive bite of the Pike enough to over ride need for stealth leaders? Are the eyes of the Bass better than the Pikes or is their attack cautious enough to make a difference?  Art
533875,splashhopper,2011-01-02 17:54:00,2931,"This is a timely topic for me as I have just been thinking about using flouro leaders for next season.  Are we getting any kind of consensus yet?  I think I am more confused now, more than I usually am.  I am hooked on bass and pike fishing now.  Am still fishing for rainbows too, but losing interest in chasing ( and time) them all over hells half acres to get them lately."
533882,Gregoire,2011-01-02 18:10:00,1397,"I think the debate here , as some other people have hinted at, is whether fluoro is superior to mono as a line. In general fluoro is a bit smaller in diameter than mono, which may be a reason why it seems to be preferred by trout anglers, as diameter seems to make a difference to the fish. I would suggest that fishing in gin clear water would also see benefits of fluoro over mono. I remember watching a facts of fishing show where Dave Mercer was fishing with a guy who was using a smaller diameter line and was having way more success drop shotting bass. I would guess that while finesse fishing the lower the diameter the better, and in this case fluoro would be ideal. When using heavier leaders for musky fishing I would think that diameter would have less of an impact. I use fluoro leaders because I believe they are better for the fish and will cause less harm than a wire leader. I would try mono leaders, but I do not tie my own, and have not found any pre-tied mono leaders. The other debate about fluro is that it is more abrasion resistant and is nearly invisible underwater as compared to mono. From what I have read this is more of a myth than reality. Why than do people swear by fluorocarbon? I would guess for a few reasons: 1. Advertising. We are definitely swayed by the constant claims that fluoro is better than mono. Also fluoro is more expensive than mono so it must be better. 2. I would also guess that people have swapped out their old mono line for fluoro lines and noticed a difference in performance. As we all know new line will perform better than old line. 3.  In addition I believe their are only 2 or 3 suppliers of fluoro line in the world. As a result the quality of fluro is quite consistent. Contrast this to the various different typed of mono, that can vary quite considerably in quality. 4. I think that a mono line that was on a shelf for a few years would degrade much more that a fluoro line that had been sitting around for the same period. You must make sure that the mono line that you use is brand new. To sum up: Fluoro seems to be a better choice for finesse presentations due to it's lower diameter. In terms of performace and invisibility the difference between the two is debatable, and some would say (myself included) that there is no noticeable difference, especially when considering the cost."
533886,ChrisK,2011-01-02 18:18:00,2772,"This is another steelhead fluoro tidbit, Theres a time and a place for everything so I like to keep all my options open so I use all the tools available to me. The key to success is to keep an open mind and adapt to the elements placed before you. Like Solo said above,its all about tippet diameter and sometimes a little color so how you go about achieving this is all up to you,fluoro or no fluoro or maybe a combination there of...Unfortunately for steelheaders this only the tip of the iceburg but its a good way to put the odds in your favour if your a novice steelheader just starting out on your journey of information overload. Heres my take on this subject. I like to use fluoro in certain conditions and other conditions I may run  maxima green and other times main line straight to the hook.Fluoro carbon is just another tool given to us by the fishing gods just as braided lines to some. You can carry all these tools in one pocket so why not take full advantage of a good thing. The trick is being able to read the water when you approach the river and tie your rig accordingly,its just that simple right"
533890,solopaddler,2011-01-02 18:31:00,8605, Great minds think alike.
533891,ChrisK,2011-01-02 18:32:00,2772,Well said fishgreg. When I was a more avid muskie fisherman a few years back I used 80lb tripplefish mono to tie my leaders on the spot. Hand full of quality snap swivels and swivels kept in a container.Usually took no more than a few minutes to make a fresh leader using the trilene knot. I picked this up off a muskie guide one day while I was out on St Clair and have been using it ever since.
533892,cwpowell,2011-01-02 18:36:00,265,"I had a reel loaded up with fluoro line and I noticed that it started to dry out and become a whitish colour and then everytime I'd tie a knot it would snap, and become frayed. It became very frail."
533893,Gregoire,2011-01-02 18:36:00,1397," I've thought about tying my own leaders, the problem is that I am no master of the fishing knot. Until I gain more experience in that area I will stick with pre-tied leaders. I hate to loose 20$ lures or a fish of a lifetime due to my incompetence."
533894,ChrisK,2011-01-02 18:40:00,2772,"Ok Solo,quit suckin up to the dwarf"
533897,SRT8 smoker craft,2011-01-02 19:01:00,1107," I agree with the no increase in hook ups, but don't you find that flouro will take abrasion way better than mono. thats why I use flouro, I find I can still horse a fish (sometimes) out of the wood with flouro which would never happen with mono, it basically snaps if it touches any wood or rocks and flouro will give you a chance to get out of the junk IMO it increases the amount of fish I land not hook ups. Might just be I have way more confidence in the flouro who Knows."
533904,ChrisK,2011-01-02 19:31:00,2772,"Float fishing is a hole different animal bud. You can't horse a freshly hooked steelhead on a float rod or you'll just end up snapping him off especially if your using a finer tippet. You just got to let them run there course and try to steer them out of the trouble areas like wood and huge boulders. I find when I'm fishing stained water and running main line with no tippet I can control them a little more but these fish are strong and will even brake you off when using heavier line. As for abrasion resistance,never an issue for the float fisherman cause we use the stealth from above method"
533915,Garry2Rs,2011-01-02 19:52:00,1425,"Lots of good ideas on Fluorocarbon here! In truth I was being a little flippant for the sake of humour in my post, but only a little...grin.  Okay, for better or worse these are my true thoughts on Fluorocarbon...  I think that for Pike and Musky leaders either mono or fluoro have the same benefits, in that they are easier on the fish and less obvious that a metal leader or tying directly to the 80 or 100 pound braid most guys are using.  I seriously doubt that there is any significant difference in abrasion resistance between a tough mono like XT and fluoro.  I believe that the invisibility angle is way over sold!  I'm fairly sure that on reaction baits, like cranks, fish respond to what they see as a fleeing prey and never consciously see the line.  I have said before that years ago fly fishermen used dental floss as a tippet to fool tough fish.  The floss wasn't invisible, but it was small in diameter, and limp.  Therefore, it was less effected by cross currents.  Cross currents cause what is called ""drag"" on a bait.  When drag is present, the fly, nymph, worm, roe bag etc. drifts in an unnatural way.  To bring this back to Fluoro, since it tends to be smaller in diameter, for a given pound-test, it might be less effected by drag than mono of the same strength.  On baits that suspend or free fall I now use Fluoro as a leader.  In fact I use fluoro as a leader on any baits that I want to sink.  It might not help, but what-the-hey, it can't hurt! I also use mono as a leader on top-waters and plastic toads, because I want them to float, and what-the-hey!  On casting reels I have used 20 pound fluoro as a running line.  I also use 20 pound mono.  It depends on whether I have a floating or sinking bait.  However, over all I prefer braid.  As a running line on spinning rods, I have had poor results.  Mono is definitely limper and might have it's place, but I prefer braid, because of line-twist issues.  After Crappie season I only use my spinning gear for Senkos and drop shotting.  I tie on a short fluoro leader...what-the-hey.  Trout, Steelhead and Walleye guys might have different opinions.  But I can only tell you my thoughts.  In summary, I first spooled up with fluorocarbon back in 2000 and have tried it again several times, as each new generation of line claimed to have solved the problems of wiry line with bad memory.  If the definition of insanity is: Doing the same thing over and over and expecting a different result.  I suppose that, as Billy Joel said, ""That only proves that I'm insane""...HAHAHA!"
533928,SRT8 smoker craft,2011-01-02 20:06:00,1107," I am talking about float fishing I horse fresh fish ALL the time it's the ONLY way to land big fish in my ""Home"" waters there's no ""steering"" the fish because there is wood every where you look .I can't coun't the amount of times I have though ""I'm gonna lose this one)as I clamp down on the float reel and hold on ,I also don't use anything less than 6lb leader and have on many occasions out fished guys using lighter line than me .I think abrasion is very important for float fisherman rivers are full of abrasive crap.OH 1 more thing stop using tippets and use regular flouro line way cheaper and stronger but everyone has their own recipe for success."
533932,Gregoire,2011-01-02 20:14:00,1397," I totally forgot abut the obvious fact that fluoro sinks and mono floats. I'll have to try using floss as a leader sometime, just for kicks."
