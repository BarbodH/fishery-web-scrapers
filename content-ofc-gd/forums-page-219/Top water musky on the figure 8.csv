868524,Handlebarz,2014-08-20 20:12:00,3790,Mike I have been trying to get some good footage of a figure 8 strike but each time the camera would be dead or out of screen to high or to low. I think I have it figured out a bit better now.
868566,googleme,2014-08-20 22:42:00,25,Did the figure 8 so many times with no luck.  Thanks so much for posting the video.  Felt like I was there!

868205,NewHips,2014-08-18 18:45:00,111,Great video.......Thanks for sharing
868206,fishnsled,2014-08-18 18:48:00,3520,Have you tried a magenta filter for the underwater camera Mike?  Suppose to help when shooting in greenish water.  There are a few videos on YouTube showing the comparisons of shooting with and without one.
868207,landry,2014-08-18 19:01:00,1005,I like how you sped it up on the turn and he nailed it. I usually slow down on the turns and speed up on the straightaways. He really wanted that thing.
868212,Handlebarz,2014-08-18 19:56:00,3790,I had the filters but they were for the hero 3+ I have to try and find them for the hero 3  I like to speed up on the outer turn it keeps the blades moving. I do mix it up if they are following for a bit. It's tough to say for sure I usually try and read the fish and this one I saw crusing under the boat and turn when it heard the bait coming
868219,misfish,2014-08-18 20:50:00,29133,That's gnarly.  Like the slow mo Mike.   X2 SWEET MIKE.

868257,BillsTheBassMan,2014-08-19 00:04:00,932,Awesome Mike!!! Impressive.   What St Croix LT is that you're using to bomb those?
868277,Handlebarz,2014-08-19 01:36:00,3790,This one is the big nasty
868278,Ron,2014-08-19 01:38:00,1683,"Really cool Mike! Wish I was there... At least i got a 94.5 incher this weekend.  Cheers, Ron..."
