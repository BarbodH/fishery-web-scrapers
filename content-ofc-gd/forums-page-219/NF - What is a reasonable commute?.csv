I still remember the winter from - well you can guess.  During a one week period I remember taking 3 to 4 hours at least to get home.  There generally were two seasons - Construction and Winter on the 400.  I am fortunate now that I have work close to home (15 minutes).  The difference is considerable - I am not as tired as I was, my patience level for idiot drivers has gotten better, and I am no longer prone to road rage (I did not think I was at the time, until I almost followed a guy with the idea of getting him off the road, pulling him out of the car, etc.  Was a - you gotta get your head checked moment for myself).  The other thing - count all the costs - both the easy ones (gas, maintenance, etc.) and the hidden ones (your time, health, time with family, etc.).  It may not be worth it - but that is a choice everyone has to make for themselves. Having said that, there were some good times - back road Fridays in the summer (had a good route home - took a little longer, but I was always moving) with Fan 590 round table was great.

After the one year lease was over, I quit my job and found something with half the pay right in my home town. Cheaper in the long run. The reason for doing it in the first place was because of the job offer. The pay was just insane! Reality kicked in and I discovered there was more to life than work."

If I found myself in that situation I would be looking for a new job. It's easier to find a job when you have one.  A fellow I use to know had a long commute and he would get the (don't know the correct name) books that are on discs from the library and would listen to then on the drive. Not sure if this is a good idea, I might get to distracted and not focus on the driving.  I lost my job of 20 years and when I was looking the commute was part of the equation. An hours drive to Peterborough would be OK but an hour in Toronto traffic wasn't. Fortunately my new job is 20km down the road. There's a couple of different routes I can take to change up the scenery and adjust for weather road conditions."

868507,Big Cliff,2014-08-20 19:11:00,6899,"You really have to balance the time and cost of commuting with the income. Sometimes when you figure out what it is costing you to do the drive every day you'd be a lot better off working locally for less money! You should also factor in your time, it has value! If you are spending 2 hours a day driving back and forth to work that is 40 hours a month (one whole week) you have just spent for nothing. Add that to the cost of fuel, the cost to own and operate your car, and the stress involved in driving in bad weather. Then you can decide if it is worth the commute."

There wasn't any 400 series highways I could take so all 80k back country roads from here to Niagara in winter as well. Just became too dangerous for me after a 10 or 12 hour day.  We all have our tolerances and I believe it would be a personal choice. I have a brother that commutes the 403to TO from Hamilton and sits in traffic for hours, no way no how I could stand that. As long as I'm moving I'm OK, sitting in traffic seems to be a waste of precious time."

A car takes half an hour, the TTC takes anywhere from 35 to 60 minutes!  I recently started risking my life and riding a bike every day.

Never bothered me but I sure don't miss it. Gas prices have doubled since then but my wages  haven't  We have been tinkering with the idea of selling our big house in the city and moving to our house/cottage in Bobcaygeon and doing the Caygeon to Oshawa commute for our last few years before we retire. The money we would save on only having one house would  easily justify it. Keep hoping Debbe can get a job transfer up that way. The day after that happens our house in Oshawa will be on the market.  When I was in Mississauga one of my co-workers commuted from Bethany to Mississauga everyday. That would be out of my comfort zone.

The highway is two lanes here, nutcases doing 140 and truckers doing 105... Make for strange bedfellows all jockeying for position to be the first stuck behind the other.... It's madness..

868559,kickingfrog,2014-08-20 22:35:00,8333,Beauty is in the eye of the beholder. Hard to say what is right for you.  The same people who think my wife is nuts for commuting from Barrie to downtown Toronto spend almost the same time as her getting to/from work. The difference for us is that downtown T.O. money spends better up here then in the GTA house/land wise. If her job existed up her she'd switch in a heartbeat for 10% less money. Twenty percent less would likely still be worth it since we have young kids.

I'd love to find a job in Barrie, but there's no way they'd pay me what they do in Toronto..  And lets face it, Barrie isn't exactly the IT hub of Ontario  Rob, does your wife take the GO Train?

Found it was easier to drop the job, than commute. 3 hours of time I could be spending with my kids. Cars falling apart after 3 years of 50,000 km per year. $500 a month in daycare costs chopped. Less stress...... After the move I was earning half the Toronto wage, working 20% fewer hours, but had more left over in the bank at the end of the month."
868596,grimsbylander,2014-08-20 23:50:00,3016,Interesting views. It looks like driving an hour one way is not optimal but certainly not all that rare. I guess I need to suck it up! Haha. Thanks for the perspective guys.
