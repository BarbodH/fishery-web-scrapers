869156,Spanky80,2014-08-24 23:48:00,152,Amazing stuff!  If you have saved the screenshot of the wreck(s) could you post?  I'm interested to see what they look like...I haven't had good success with my DI as of yet.
869157,Dave Bailey,2014-08-24 23:54:00,1641,"Wow, those are giants!  Got some more info on that wreck from http://www.boatnerd.com/swayze/shipwreck/a.htm :   Glad you had the sonar to find it. Would be a shame if you didn't know it was there, dropped an anchor on it, and caused more damage. Not like it's going to be salvaged, but still a shame to wreck a wreck."
