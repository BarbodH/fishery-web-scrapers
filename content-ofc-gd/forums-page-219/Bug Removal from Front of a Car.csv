He's tried ordinary car soap, pressure washer, WD40 and there's still quite a bit of debris left.  Is there a good commercial product or another home made remedy that you've tried that works on stubborn bug residue?  "
868847,kickingfrog,2014-08-22 19:31:00,8333,I find that 4 months of winter works great at getting bug guts off the vehicles.
868848,AKRISONER,2014-08-22 19:31:00,5558,"get yourself a clay bar with a bottle of quick detailer, rub the clay on the bugs until they are gone!  Also tell your pops to wax his car more, it makes stuff easier to get off!"
868849,leaf4,2014-08-22 19:32:00,2466,"Soak it in water and soap as long as possible then use a sponge with a mesh over top, if that doesn't work use a claybar, they have kits at Canadian tire for $29.99, I would suggest using soap in a bottle rather than the solutions they provide with the kit I detailed for 3 years at a BMW dealership and saw all sorts of stuff end up on paint and claybar does the trick"

868855,wallyboss,2014-08-22 20:17:00,1095,I've used GooGone and it works pretty good. I put it on and let it sit for 10-15 min. then wiped it right off.

868877,Ralph Field,2014-08-22 22:34:00,1018,I use varsol then rewax
868882,NANUK,2014-08-22 22:58:00,797,"Cover with wet paper towels, let it sit for 30 minutes, make sure paper towels don't dry out, wash with regular car wash soap, Any remains, use bug & tar remover as per directions on the can from CT"
868898,northernpike56,2014-08-23 01:30:00,717,"+1 for clay bar (and wax if he has the time). I have always used meguiars clay bar kits that come with everything you need, do the whole car while youre at it. It will look gorgeous after a good clay bar and wax."
