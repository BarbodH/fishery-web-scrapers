I know very little about this reel other than it has a computer chip in it for braking. How much difference is there between reels both features and price,hoping I did not overpay."

867973,Ainsley,2014-08-17 02:47:00,142,I use a calcutta 100dc and my cranking rod and it is one of my fav reels.  Really bombs them out there!
868591,googleme,2014-08-20 23:30:00,25,You did well!!!  I have both reels.  The 200B I used for all my Musky fishing (can handle is easily) and the 100 TE DC I used for Walleye and Bass.  BTW... The 100 TE DC is $529 plus tax at most retailers right now.  Hope you enjoy it.   I am going to post the sale of both reels soon on this forum.  (I have sooooo much Gear!!) LOL
