868927,LostAnotherOne,2014-08-23 14:51:00,956,Hi there boys.  I'm new to this forum and was looking for some lessons on how to fish.  I'm recently a single girl with blonde hair and about 125lbs.  If anyone is interested in giving me private lessons just let me know.  Just kidding .  I'm a 32 year old male who enjoys fishing year round and I'm here to learn as mush as I can.  Have a good one

869036,LostAnotherOne,2014-08-24 01:56:00,956,"Thanks guys for the replies.  I love fishing for muskie, but only have caught 5 of them so far.  Caught a 38"" muskie two weeks ago which was awesome.  Spring time and fall are my favourite times to head out.  Everything seems to be active and I'm usually out about 3 times a week.  This winter will be my third year ice fishing.  We head up to Lake Simcoe for perch once a week, but getting tired of dink after dink so the plan this year is to head up to Bay of Quinte and hopefully beat my personal best walleye (20"").  Take care"
