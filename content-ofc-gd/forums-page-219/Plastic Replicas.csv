868351,lakerguy,2014-08-19 17:46:00,224,Does anyone have a replica of a fish they caught? I caught a 32.5 in walleye on the weekend and am considering getting one made. Also is there anyone in the area of SW Ont that does a really good job of this?  I have a good bunch of pics of the fish.  Can't seem to figure out how to put one up though Thanks

868580,googleme,2014-08-20 23:06:00,25,What a beast of a fish!!!  Great Job Lakerguy!
868623,Nipfisher,2014-08-21 02:40:00,2449,Solid walleye. That is a pig.
868684,craigdritchie,2014-08-21 15:27:00,1586,Nice walleye indeed. Great catch.  I also highly recommend Advanced Taxidermy. Their fish replicas look like they're alive. I have a 37-inch steelhead they did for me almost 15 years ago ... it still looks like I just slid it up the bank. And the stuff they do now is even better!
868720,lakerguy,2014-08-21 18:42:00,224,Thanks guys Put the order in with Advanced Should look great above our fireplace
