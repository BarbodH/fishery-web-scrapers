I am working at a fishing lodge and of course have been fishing throughout my time here as well. I have experienced some pretty great fishing and the wildlife and scenery isn't too shabby either. I will let the pics and videos do the talking.   Exploring/ Beachcombing some of the nearby islands          Went on a staff fishing trip one day out in the Grady White. Salmon fishing was on!                  Big ugly lingcod   Bald Eagle that hangs around the dock some days   Bald Eagles are pretty damn big.   Here is a link to a video I shot on my go pro of the local bald eagles eating some carcasses we dumped on the rocks:    Floating down a river near the lodge fishing for cutthroat along the way      Went out fishing for Albacore tuna one day.. pretty wild.  My buddy looking for signs of Tuna.   The result:     Here is a link to another video shot on the GoPro of a huge ocean sunfish we spotted while tuna fishing:    And finally a lake that I fish that is full of small cutthroats ready to take a fly. Requires a pretty good hike in and then you have to paddle around in a little skiff that leaks.   Hope you enjoyed the pics and videos.   DS  "

868731,misfish,2014-08-21 20:35:00,29133,Nice job you got yourself there.  Im surprised the eagles didnt fly off with their feed. They all seemed to just nip away and bounce each other off.LOL
