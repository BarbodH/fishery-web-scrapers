868500,spincast,2014-08-20 18:34:00,3279,"looks like a great time; it's years like this that make us truly appreciate fishing; I suspect in a few years you'll be sitting around with the gang, having a beer saying ""Do you remember '14? Fished like all get out and all I managed was  ......."" Your ""small "" catch beats my one and only Muskie by a mere 11 inches"
868539,mattybculp,2014-08-20 21:14:00,388,"Glad to hear you and Diane are having a great time, despite the challenging weather. I think every picture of you has that same grin on your face, I love it ! lol.  Hope it picks up for you, I'm sure a biggun is coming your way !"
868572,googleme,2014-08-20 22:47:00,25,Beautiful Musky.  Looks so clean!
868350,lew,2014-08-19 17:46:00,12766,"Hi guys  I'm still up here on the West Arm of Nippissing chasing muskies but it's the poorest fishing I've ever seen in my 10 years of coming here. Weeds are still low in most areas and the water temps have dropped 7 degrees in the last week. Still having a great trip but  a couple big fish would be nice.  I hooked into a biggun a couple days back while trolling but never got her to the boat.  My wife and I headed out this morning to a favorite spot and I hooked this girl on the very 1st cast of the day. She was only a thin 45"" but at least it got that skunk off my back.  Just to show how good the muskies are normally up here, this is the smallest fish I've ever got in these waters.  Hopefully it'll pick up before we head home on Saturday but as I've always said of this lake and how beautiful it is, I could fish here all week and get skunked but still go home and say I had a fabulous week of fishing.  "

868373,John,2014-08-19 20:24:00,2956,"Great stuff Lew, I didn't see one all week never mind hook into one. Did you try Cross Lk yet?"
868378,misfish,2014-08-19 21:11:00,29133,"Well done Lew. Man, first cast. SWEET."
868381,Dan668,2014-08-19 21:33:00,1120,"Nice fish. I was on the french earlier, was slow but the bass and pike kept me busy. Not good hearing the west arm is slow. Im headed there on the long weekend for the first time. Ill try my luck at finding a big 'ski."
868382,solopaddler,2014-08-19 21:34:00,8605,"Right on Lew! 45"" is small? LOL"
868385,outllaw,2014-08-19 21:46:00,1232,lew were not worthy . 1 cast 1 musky. quit while yer ahead.  good stuff.
868387,lew,2014-08-19 22:03:00,12766,"Right on Lew! 45"" is small? LOL  Didn't mean to imply 45 is small Mike,  but there's so many big fish up here a 45 just seems small...if that makes any sense  And John, no we can't make it to Cross and the other fella is tied up with work.  Thanks for the comments guys, I'm having a blast up here as always !!"
868389,misfish,2014-08-19 22:05:00,29133,  Just keep on smiling Lew.
868391,lew,2014-08-19 22:10:00,12766, 1 cast 1 musky. quit while yer ahead.  You know as well as I do George it was a fluke
868398,glen,2014-08-20 00:13:00,2641,Nice pic.  That will give some hope around here.
868400,outllaw,2014-08-20 00:24:00,1232,"just teasing lew. after all the years chasin skies,,,you know the drill from hero to zero and back."
868408,BillsTheBassMan,2014-08-20 01:56:00,932,They really turned on for me there last Friday Lew.  Keep after them.  They are there.  Got only bad pictures as I had to fish by myself. I'm going back mid September.   You been up through the west narrows?
868416,Wagoneer,2014-08-20 03:02:00,118,"I've always said of this lake and how beautiful it is, I could fish here all week and get skunked but still go home and say I had a fabulous week of fishing. Can't agree any more about nipissing. When you go out to a great lake and get skunked it's a crappy day because the shoreline is ugly (most of it) and they're basically giant puddles surrounded by flat land. But up north and especially the nipissing area the shoreline is so beautiful and there's so much wildlife around you getting skunked doesn't mean it was a crappy day on the water. It's the kind of lake where you could just drive out to the centre and just sit there with a worm on a hook with a smile on."
868419,Moosebunk,2014-08-20 03:10:00,3970,A start eh Lew!?!??
868432,bigbuck,2014-08-20 10:28:00,2449,Now for a pic of a supertanker up there. Good to see you got yourself de-skunked!!!
868443,ccmtcanada,2014-08-20 12:42:00,7971,"The ""smallest"" Muskie you've caught up there beats my pb by 2"".  I don't feel sorry for you!!! Lol  Glad to hear you for the skunk off your back Lew!!"
868457,mistyriver1,2014-08-20 14:12:00,600,"Nice clean fish Lew, Congrats !  That's musky fishing for you eh,  see nothing all week and first cast one day BANG.  Hope you and Diane are enjoying it up there.  That drop in water temp may get them in the fall eating mode.  Good luck resot fo the week.  Jim"
868480,mike rousseau,2014-08-20 17:04:00,4661,You gotta get to the Larry this year Lew...  Musky are on fire here this year...
