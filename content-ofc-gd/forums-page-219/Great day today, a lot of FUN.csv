A couple hits and a nice Perch in 53' of water for myself lol. Shaun(xx goaler) and I decided let's jig in a area we found which was almost constant beeps and fish throughout the column. I start at the bottom,him at 40',I'm in 121'.and he gets a hit. A real nice and respectable 9lb laker for table fare.Nice job bud!!   "
