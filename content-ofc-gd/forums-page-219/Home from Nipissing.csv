868958,lew,2014-08-23 19:14:00,12766,"Hi guys, I've been away for our 3rd trip to  Memquisit Lodge on the West Arm of Nippising for the last 14 days and just got home awhile ago.  500 miles round trip and everything is good and the truck and boat performed perfectly.  Our log cabin was great, the hosts are excellent and as always the scenery was unbeatable.  As I posted earlier this week the musky fishing was the slowest I've seen in 10 years up there and  it rained 1/2 the time but it was an excellent trip and my wife and I had a great time.  Good to be home but I can't wait to head north again.  "
868969,misfish,2014-08-23 19:45:00,29133,"Read your, on site reports Lew. Sound like a great time was had, no matter the weather.  Nice to see you and Dianne home safe.  Almost time for you to think of hibernation aint it? LOL"
868971,Rich Clemens,2014-08-23 19:52:00,3131,"Good to catch up with you folks again this year.  Sooty the fishing was tough this year, but sure does beat sitting at home"

868990,Whopper,2014-08-23 21:35:00,2174,Glad t hear you had a good time.  I know where that picture was taken

868998,Dan668,2014-08-23 22:19:00,1120,"Slow fishing or not, always great to get up north! Next weekend will be my third trip up to that area. Slow for sure, but always a great time. Did you by any chance manage to fish anywhere in the West Arm?"
869001,ketchenany,2014-08-23 22:37:00,3229,Slow fishing for you is our dreams! Glad you got home safe and sound Lew. You have been gone for a while:) keep well.
869003,lew,2014-08-23 22:50:00,12766,Thanks ketchenany  Did you by any chance manage to fish anywhere in the West Arm?  I spend most of my time in West Bay east of 64
869006,Dan668,2014-08-23 23:07:00,1120,"Thanks ketchenany   I spend most of my time in West Bay east of 64  Same. Im headed up with a friend who has a small tin. Don't want to ditch him, so ill be trying out ""new to me"" spots in the Arm. Haven't read too many if any reports this year from the actual arm. Before you left, what were the water temps like?"
869019,Joey,2014-08-24 00:12:00,9122,"Glad you're home and had a great trip Lew.  No matter the weather, it's always nice to be up there.  That's the naked men cabin  Saw your other pic with the first cast musky - awesome!!!   Can't wait to see you two again.   September right?"
869020,lew,2014-08-24 00:13:00,12766,"A week ago the temps were around 72F, then dropped to 65 over the next week and by yesterday they'd climbed back to about 68 so their going in the right direction. Weeds are still lower than normal but I think things will be back to somewhat normal once the temps get back into the 70's.  Good luck when you get up there."
869022,lew,2014-08-24 00:15:00,12766,"Hiya Joey, we were posting at the same time and I was replying to Dan.  Yup, that's the cabin  And nope, we won't be up again till next year."
869023,Joey,2014-08-24 00:22:00,9122,"Oh, okay, thought you were going to go for the Fall bite.  We usually go late Sept./early Oct   Any better weeds?"
869026,lew,2014-08-24 00:27:00,12766,"Aikinheads is normal growth right now Joey but most other places, including the big bay, are still 3-4 feet below the surface.  BTW, Diane wants to know if you can send me the pics you took of her & Barb with the crazy lights attached to their glasses in your cabin."
869028,Bernie,2014-08-24 00:41:00,3190,Glad you went home Lew.The weather has turned nice again 
869030,lew,2014-08-24 00:50:00,12766,"The sun was shining bright when we left this morning Bernie, 1st time it wasn't raining  in a week .....naturally LOL"
869033,John,2014-08-24 01:46:00,2956,Glad you and Di got home safe. Tough fishing indeed! Hope to see you guys again soon
