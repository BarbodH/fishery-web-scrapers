868675,LeXXington,2014-08-21 14:49:00,1928,Living in the GTA it can take 2+ hours just to get across the city.  4 hours is normally my limit for a day of fishing..  Any longer then it really depends on if there is hotel I want to stay at our if I prefer my own bed.
868680,craigdritchie,2014-08-21 15:15:00,1586,"I'd rather not drive farther than necessary, but if it's really worth it, I will travel a long way for a good bite - especially if it gets me away from the crowds. I have 2014 fishing licences for Ontario, Quebec, New York, Pennsylvania, Michigan, Wisconsin, Indiana, Minnesota, Kentucky and Arkansas. I like taking advantage of opportunities to catch different kinds of fish, or enjoy open seasons when things are still closed at home.  Driving 3 to 6 hours one-way for a good steelhead bite is not unusual. Yes, I know I can catch fish 100 yards from my house. But if I can catch a lot more fish somewhere else, and do it without standing elbow to elbow with other people, then I have no problem gassing up the truck.  I've driven to Florida for a weekend of fishing many times. No better way to beat the winter blahs than by catching a bunch of redfish, pompano and small sharks out in the Gulf.  A day fishing is a pretty important thing. I have no problem driving farher if it makes that day even more special."
868702,asdve23rveavwa,2014-08-21 17:13:00,2690,"Like many others, three hours one way is about my limit.  Filling up the Sierra is pretty darn expensive these days."
868703,Governator,2014-08-21 17:15:00,879,Anything over 1.5hr and I'm setting up camp and disconnecting.  It helps living north of the city where fish-able water is within 10min of my driveway.
868704,limeyangler,2014-08-21 17:24:00,5204,Anything more than 3 hours would have to mean it was pretty unbelievable fishing and if the fishing was that good you'd better believe i'm staying more than a day…..so my answer would be 3 hours.
868713,mistyriver1,2014-08-21 18:15:00,600,"Great topic.  Like many, 3 hours probably would probably be my limit as well.  Now that I am living right by Lake Simcoe, my drive time to it and many lakes has diminshed greatly : )  Jim"

868741,muskymatt,2014-08-21 21:54:00,2608,I've done a couple day trips with a 7hr round trip. That is about as far as I would go considering fishing an additional 8-10hrs makes for a pretty hard drive home. Safety first.

868760,Canuck2fan,2014-08-21 23:47:00,1444,"In the past I used to drive roughly an hour each way to go fishing minimum 2 times a week sometimes I would go 3 or 4. Occasionally a buddy and I would drive 3 hrs one way to fish over Saturday night into Sunday if we both had Monday off. I am lucky in that I am situated about an equal distance between the places I like to go on both Lake Erie and Huron.  This year with having my hours cut in half I am fishing less, with more time than ever to go. The cost of gas, lunches, bait when we can't catch our own, along with the incredibly horrible lack of fish every time I could get out has me fishing maybe twice a month now. Hopefully, the fall chrome season will be better, but I am not counting on it.  I have NEVER seen a year where I have heard, they were just jumping on the pier yesterday you should have been here then... so many times LOL."
868761,Ron,2014-08-22 00:01:00,1683,"Well, for a day trip, We have fished the St. Marys River. 8.5 hr drive, one way.  Have been known to fish St. Clair for a weekend, got blown off the lake on the Saturday, packed up and fished Stoco Lake in Tweed on the Sunday.  4 day weekend on Nipigon. Left on a Wednesday after work, fished the Thursday, Friday and Saturday. After fishing til dark, pack up and start the 14 hour drive home to be back Sunday afternoon, unload toys and load tools for work on the Monday.  Heck I have even done 4 hour drives one way just to go to a 2 hour Muskie Canada Meeting! (Hamiltonn, KW, Sudbury and Ottawa)  No regrets......  (I think I got a fishing problem).....

I'm with you Ron, I guess my reasons for driving a long way sometimes are 1) I like driving for me its half the fun, 2) I hate jet skis and tubers so also prefer to avoid crowds, 3) I like the Northern atmosphere better than down South,  No cottages, few boats, and endless water to explore is also half the fun for me.  I'd move up North if it wasn't for the pesky problem that my job is down South"
868793,SWOrange,2014-08-22 12:18:00,6,"Longest I've done is about 3.5 hours. If I was going any further, I'd be camping or finding a hotel room."
868794,Sharkbait22,2014-08-22 12:20:00,297,"2-3 hrs but there have been notable exceptions.  I have a rule that I must fish for at least as long as the drive. So 2 hrs mean 4 hrs fishing minimum.  I prefer to double that so 2 hrs = 8hrs.  If I drive a day (10hrs) I'll stay fishing for 3 days (12+ hrs per day).  I need restful sleep to function well.  Just 6-7 hrs will do fin for days on end.  After a couple days of little quality sleep I'm not at my best, certainly not as fun, talkative, or witty.  This conversation also gets me thinking about fuel efficient but off-road capable vehicles and down-sizing my boat."

868832,mepps,2014-08-22 16:55:00,1301,"I regularly drive 2-3 hours and then another 1-2 hiking or canoeing to get into remote places.  While living in Halifax I would drive 4+ hours to Fredericton for muskie fishing. The trips typically started around 1am and I would get home 23-24 hours later. I did this at least a dozen times and probably half the trips resulted in zero fish caught! That being said, I'd do it again in a heartbeat, those big river muskies are awesome!"
868834,JoshS,2014-08-22 17:22:00,729,Depends on time of year and what I'm fishing for but for the most part 2-3 hr max with some exceptions a few times a year. I'll drive far for good fishing but don't drive far often for only a day trip.
868835,Raf,2014-08-22 17:27:00,3495,"it's the inverse of the price of gas.  i don't do many one day trips anymore due to cost unless it is within 2 hours or so.   however, i do more multiple day trips if that makes sense.  just takes more planning."

I lived in Hamilton and am now in Mississauga, and at least twice a summer on a day off I will drive to either Temagami or Onaping for a single day of fishing.  Temagami is about 450 kms from me and Onaping over 500 one way.  I will get done work late afternoon, crash til about 10 pm, then grab my boat and go.  I arrive 4-5 am, launch, then fish all day.  Usually I am pooped by dinnertime so I pull out, snooze in my truck for a couple hours, then hit the road 6-7 pm getting home after midnight.  I can't be the worst in the forums for crazy spur of the moment trips like that, just wanted to hear if anyone else does stuff like this?  Tony"

868642,OhioFisherman,2014-08-21 10:34:00,6623,"Driving distance was the main reason I stopped fishing with the first bass club I was in, why would you chose lakes the farthest distance away for one day tournaments? Ya, driving from here to New York state for a one day tournament was right on top of my to do list! Note the sarcasm.  A difference in the mind set of the younger and older members, the younger ones still seemed to consider themselves indestructible? It's supposed to be fun? not an endurance contest? At the end of a tournament us older guys with families liked to make sure we weren't beat to death and could return safely to our families?  Club #2 with the older family guys and their adult kids had a better perspective, schedule the farthest tournaments away as two day events, in mid summer when school was out, and you could also turn them into family vacations at those lakes.  Plenty of places for me to fish within an hour or two of home, why  knock myself out? If I felt a need to get away and do some serious fishing? A week or two vacation covered it."
