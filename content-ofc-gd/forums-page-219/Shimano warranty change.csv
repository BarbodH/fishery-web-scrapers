868609,musky_hunter,2014-08-21 01:21:00,328,Aikman's is an authorized repair depot. I doubt he will continue to take care of warranty or service. Customers are now told to contact Shimano canada for all warranty and service for Shimano/G.Loomis. Stores are told not to give replacements or take broken rods.
867606,FrankTheRabbit,2014-08-14 15:11:00,479,"Thanks for confirming on the Loomis rods. Although reassuring for now, it remains to be seen if they apply the same Shimano warranty with Loomis rods. Hopefully I'm wrong on that."
867636,Moosebunk,2014-08-14 19:08:00,3970,"It always seems the more money i spend on fishing gear, the more it breaks? Anyone else with me in this boat ahahhaa  Same here man!  The easier it breaks actually.  Buy ""mostly"" mid-range priced gear.  Depends on it's annual usage or it's purpose.  LeBaron's ""actually"" and SAIL ""especially"" have treated me well on returns of late."
867647,misfish,2014-08-14 20:27:00,29133,"The thing with warranties is they are designed to cover manufacturers defects, which in general will fail within the first few trips if there is one. Many people take advantage of it and get a rod covered that is 10+ years old and Shimano loses their shirt on it, I would be surprised to see other companies follow suit and shorten their warranties within the next 5-10 years. It must have been pretty bad if they can afford to hire several staff to work full-time inspecting rods.  Well said Miller.  I have one high end rod. Custom made.  All my others are mid 80-100 bucks. Im still fishing many of them after 10+ years. The only think Im seeing on them is the guide wrap coating is  starting to crack.  Big deal. 10+ years of great use."
867692,miller,2014-08-15 02:54:00,223,"Regardless of what dealer you go through they can no longer handle Shimano warranties, you have to send it in yourself."
867693,miller,2014-08-15 02:57:00,223,"I see it every day working on the retail end in fishing, guys abuse the rods get plenty of years out of it and expect it to be warrantied, other companies like Pure Fishing(Abu, Fenwick, Berkley) have already gotten more strict with their policies. If you get several years out of a rod you've easily gotten your money's worth."
867694,miller,2014-08-15 03:03:00,223,"The more you spend on a rod the more sensitive, light, etc it is which comes by using the more brittle material, you buy a cheap rod it's built with cheap components which will take a beating. Glass rods compared to graphite is the easiest example. Take a look at the classic ugly stik, you can fold them in half without breaking it but for sensitivity you can't feel crap lol."
867695,BillM,2014-08-15 03:06:00,17367,"This is why I buy St.Croix Avids (or higher), it breaks, I send it back and get a new one.. The replacement costs are minimal.  There's no way I'm going to drop $200 on a new Shimano rod and then another $100 to replace it if it snaps 2 years down the road, that's insanity."
867707,GBW,2014-08-15 04:03:00,8460,"Well, my 2 cents don't count for squat around here BUT Shimano sure did me right in the past few weeks.  I lost the top 1/2 section of a rod while bushwhacking fishing.  It was 100% my fault as it fell out of the bag it was in.  I left a message asking what the cost was to get a new top 1/2 for it.  I found out after 4 days (of the bottom section getting to them in Peterborough for match up the harware) that I was going to get a whole rod sent to me on ""good faith"" to why the top was missing.  This rod value was not a $200 one but they only made this one for a year AND only had a short warranty.  So for ME I AM and WILL BE a Shimano customer for a very long time to come. PS, this was and IS the BEST customer service from ANY company in a long time that I have had.  So Shimano will still get my support when I need more gear hands down. Ardent and others now have no chance with me due to the problems I have had this year alone with them..."
867797,bare foot wader,2014-08-15 19:57:00,1354,"maybe change a few of my future purchases,  but overall still a big shimano fan, they've been much better than some other companies on customer service (and it also says they will still honour existing lifetime warranties)  regardless of manufacturer, high end usually equals higher sensitivity and lighter weight, both of which tend to come at the expense of durability...and for some rods I'm ok with taking that risk"
867861,thegrumpyfisherman,2014-08-16 02:42:00,59,"It was a great gimmick but be honest guys, how many people can actually say they used that warranty for defects?  I broke 2 rods this year (so far), and as much as it pissed me off I can admit both were probably my own fault... (yanking too hard on a snag, and trying to yank one out of a storage compartment a little too aggressively)  I'm by no means suggesting there aren't legit defects all the time, but from their end when something snapped gets sent in they pretty much had to replace it under the old policy, unless there was an obvious boot print left on it or something.   I'd be interested to see the hard numbers of how many new rods they were having to dole out, that they were forced to make such a drastic policy change...  Tony"

I think lifetime warrantys are a bit unrealistic to be honest.  The only rods I've broken have been purely operator error, and the few that have been defective have broken on the first or second trip out.  I really like Shimano reels, and if I liked their rods I probably wouldn't let a 1 year warranty stop me.  I would expect a reasonable warranty period of a minimum of 5 years if I laid out the cash for a new Loomis IMX or the like though!  The price of those rods pretty much includes a free replacement imho."

867972,miller,2014-08-17 02:46:00,223,They will be covered but the new rod you receive will only have one year.
868008,MCTFisher9120,2014-08-17 13:27:00,3761,"This is nice to see. Almost all rods taken in have been casted many many times and caught and landed fish.

They want to stop taking broken rods in that take damage from rod lockers, doors etc. If the rod is bruised or hit on the blank it creates a weak point on the blank and this is why they break. Warranty? I think not, user error breaks rods. I broke a St Croix few years ago, the rod was 2 years old and took a hit near the tip section. In order for better products to hit the market they need to tone the warranty down because there is to much cost factored into it.

Tightlines, not surprised to see these posts    MTBF   I partially agree with what you said Mike, but working in a tackle store, as other i know do, most receive a supplier discount, which im sure you do, as you stated most if not all of your rods and reels are shimano, so its in YOUR best interest to say nice things, your right many do mysteriously snap tips when new line ups come out, but i to like the older line ups, when cork was the norm on rods, and not the cheap EVA foam, rod prices should drop, as warranties are reduced, but i doubt that will happen, if they want to produce more stronger rods, i would suggest they manufacture, and assemble in North America, meaning blanks, and all hardware, such as the case when they built there only North American rod the V-Rod, which was assembled in Washington State, then i might see the benefits of paying full pop for a Crucial with a one year warranty, and not something made offshore with cheap labour, where they likely dont know what a spine is, and its importance for guide placement"

867526,FrankTheRabbit,2014-08-14 03:27:00,479,"Depending on the type of rod, 1-year may not be sufficient. Shimano has a lot of species/technique specific rods. Eg., being bass. Bass season being open from 3rd week of June till end of November, which is five months. Realistically, a lot of casual bass anglers stop fishing after October, so you only have 4 months to fish that rod. And you may only have two or three weekends per month to fish, so really, you'd be taking the the rod out about 12 times during a season. That really isn't a lot of time to know whether or not your purchase is a lemon. And what about more hardcore anglers who have an array of rods. So that rod you purchased might even see even less water time.  I'd say, bump it to two years. That's more reasonable than having a one year warranty.  Gonna re-ask…but anyone know if Loomis rods are affected by the same warranty coverage?"

They replace it no problem but are 4.5 hours away! For $60 or so I can mail it in. So I called Shimano. When you press #1 for English it disconnects me. So, after 3 try's i press #2 for French. That hangs up too. Lol. Called Sail again...they offered to make arrangements to return to Shimano for me or they said I could just wait till I was through Oshawa again and get my money back as they don't have another one. They have the Shimano rods on clearance. So I am not too impressed with Shimano at this time, however thrilled with the customer service at Sail.

867558,Steve,2014-08-14 11:29:00,2075,"just keep an eye on their RAISING prices.  BEFORE, Shimano claimed almost 15% of a rod cost (in some cases 20%) is for the expected warranty returns.  So, right off the mark, the prices should have dropped 15%.  OF COURSE they didn't.  I've been told by a local shimano rep that next year we will see another raise in prices.  Shimano is only out for one thing - your wallet.  Their quality has been dramatically decreasing over the last five years.  Their unwillingness to work with left handed bait casters is remarkable.  I personally hope Shimano's sales drops drastically over the next couple years - that way whom ever made these decisions get shown the door. THANKFULLY they are some real nice rods currently in the market with MUCH better warranties...and in some cases, cheaper.  Like Bunk, when you use your tackle a lot - and I mean every week/weekend (not just for a ""season""), you will see broken rods....I can't count on both my hands the number of broken rods I've had over the last 10 years."
