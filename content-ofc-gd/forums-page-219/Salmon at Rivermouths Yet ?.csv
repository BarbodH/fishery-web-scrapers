868521,Uncle Lucky,2014-08-20 20:05:00,1,Hey there folks. Anybody seen salmon right at the river mouths or harbours yet. I fish from my yak and was considering fishing the mouth of the Saugeen. It has to be time with the cool water temps and all. Any news would be very appreciated.
868522,fishindevil,2014-08-20 20:08:00,6254,The salmon have arrived in lots of areas and guys are getting them off the piers and in some cases in the creeks & rivers already !!!! Go get em !!!
868523,fishindevil,2014-08-20 20:09:00,6254,I have not seen any reports from Huron yet but for Lake Ontario !!!!

Me too the boys have been flanking the east piers since late july, guys in Yaks have had trouble hooking Chins while casting due to the Yak moving during the hookset and not penetrating, but they are doing better trolling"
