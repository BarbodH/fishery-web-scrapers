868017,FISHEYEZ,2014-08-17 14:18:00,49,"Does anyone have experience or advice for registering a small trailer, which was put together/refurbished/manufactured by me and some buddies, it is for a 12' boat. I was told it is as simple as walking in to service ontario and tell them it was home made. Cant believe it would be that simple, so what should I have prepared for when I do go in? Thanks in advance!"
868019,Sinker,2014-08-17 14:25:00,8692,"Yep, its pretty much that simple.  S."
868022,Entropy,2014-08-17 15:10:00,747,Same sort of deal with homemade boats too.  I think.
868025,bushart,2014-08-17 15:30:00,2628,yes
868039,mistaredone,2014-08-17 16:18:00,913,That easy. I had an OPP question my home made papers a few weeks ago but after explaining I got it from the scrap yard and rebuilt all the parts I was on my way.
868041,FISHEYEZ,2014-08-17 16:21:00,49,Thanks guys! I will stop there Monday.
868060,Paudash,2014-08-17 20:47:00,273,"have my ATV, boat, and jet ski trailers all registered as home builds to avoid the taxes and no issues. I think the cost is $35.00"
868075,Joeytier,2014-08-17 22:30:00,3990,It is that simple.  It only gets more complex if your trailer exceeds a certain weight (maybe 10 000 lbs?)
868146,limeyangler,2014-08-18 12:39:00,5204,"Yup, was worried I'd get all kinds of questions asked when I bought a second hand one a couple years back, but it really is as simple as walking in and saying ""its homemade""."
868175,DanD,2014-08-18 16:15:00,2223,"If you register the trailer as homemade, you had best be sure there is no VIN plate or a serial # stamped into the frame somewhere. The people at the license office don't care; because you're signing stating the information you have given them is true. It'll be the boys in the MTO uniforms that may get a little pissy; if the registration papers and identifying numbers on the trailer don't match.  Dan."
868281,Rattletrap2,2014-08-19 01:49:00,1652,"Good point Dan! As far as registering goes, you just need to state the colour and number of axles. Pretty simple!"
868300,Wagoneer,2014-08-19 05:15:00,118,"If you register it as home made and it's technically not, just make sure you remove the registration plate. You're not doing anything illegal by doing so. Technically if you change out any major component of the trailer (ie. tongue, axle, parts of the frame etc) then it's qualified as home made. And you also have to mark the trailer with the registration number somewhere on the trailer that you got with your license. If an officer can't match the number with something on the trailer than he has no idea if this is the trailer you registered. Or the opposite of that if he finds the original registration plate he's going to think you're trying to register multple trailers with the same license and just switch the plate around.  I have my trailer registered as home made because the only thing left is the frame from the original. But since I swapped out my tongue with the longer one I didn't have to worry about replacing the tag. I have my registration number etched into my trailer tongue, easy to find and read.  Also don't forget to having a working license plate light on your trailer. This is their favourite thing to nail people for and it's one of the most overlooked and forgotten things when building a custom trailer. It doesn't have to look pretty, doesn't even have to be really functional, just has to be a white light sorta/kinda pointing towards the general direction of the plate."
868313,mistaredone,2014-08-19 11:33:00,913,Good info!  I just replaced my old one as it fell of or was stolen?  I better check for a light or install one. Thanks
868428,FISHEYEZ,2014-08-20 09:58:00,49,"Alright, all done! Took a total of 5 minutes to register and get a plate....looks like it was really that simple. Again, thanks everyone!"
868467,creditmaster,2014-08-20 15:07:00,190,yes
