Bass is always ""ON"" and usually easy to catch. AS for Muskies??? HMMMM I've heard of them caught there but never actually spoken to an angler that has caught one... I've been fishing it for about 25 Yrs or so ... and a Buddy of mine has a cottage there and has been fishing it for more than 40yrs and has never caught nor seen a Muskie come out of there either.  Water is still 4+' low and not rising very fast. Never stayed at Mountain Home...but the people who I know that have liked their stay.  Randy "

Most productive spot for us was the North west end of the lake where the river enters the main basin; good deep current between the big island and North shore, drop shotting live minnows for pike and eyes.  Good luck! beauty of a lake. Prop"
