So I fish the tri lakes a fair bit and have fished a few local tournaments and have done well. But I will pose the question and ask your feedback on your thoughts. So I filled the live well with five decent largies, I go to th weigh in and some tourneys will have a boat that releases the fish in certain areas whether it's the chemong causeway or Gannon's narrows bridge area. So my question is do or will bass return to the area they are caught ? Or just find closer ideal structure to where they are released? Now my milk run spots do replenish with fish whether there the same fish or not is uncertain. But since it can be quite a distance say Gannon's narrows to north pigeon I feel as though I may be giving them a little to much credit on how ""smart"" ( which I know is the wrong word) they are. My instincts tell me they just find ideal structure close to where they are released, but I am truly curious. I looked around for info on the intranet but it was just giving seasonal migration patterns which Is not what I'm looking for. So what do you think? I'm hoping this isn't a dumb question but I was curious. But I know I've gotten a few PBs thrown it in the live well travelled back to the house on upper buckhorn Got a quick shot then released it at the dock. Would they be enept to kinda hanging around or are they outta dodge, trying to head back home. Thanks guys."

I am guessing that a lot make it back to an area they were comfortable and familiar with."
868778,singingdog,2014-08-22 10:47:00,1047,Here's an interesting quote from a study done in New Hampshire:  Relocating large numbers of bass to Ames Farm Inn release site may negatively impact bass

868805,mattybculp,2014-08-22 13:26:00,388,"That's Funny I read that article late last night singing dog. It was pretty much what I was looking for ! Thanks ohio fisherman, when I get a minute i'm going to look at those articles. Akrisoner, for that study, pretty much. But I do know some tournaments, will have multiple stops to release fish so they're dispersed more evenly, more so on larger bodies of water."
868813,OhioFisherman,2014-08-22 14:17:00,6623,"so what this is saying is after a tournament, fish where the release area was lol.  LOL it's not a bad place to start? A few days after a tournament once the fish have calmed down? I doubt that smallies will hold in a shallow weedy area that is a release area for anywhere near as long as a largemouth would?  I won a tournament on a lake in New York fishing for two days never more than a couple of thousand feet from the only resort-campground on the lake. They had 4-5 different bass clubs that would stay there and have tournaments over the season. Weigh in by their launching ramp and the best habitat for largemouth in that area, smallies almost always  came from areas farther away with deeper water and rocky areas in them.  A small lake though only 300 acres or so, doesn't take much time for a fish to find their comfort zone?"
