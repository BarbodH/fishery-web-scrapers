868265,North Hunter,2014-08-19 00:40:00,1,"Bought a Powersonic PS-12350 NB for my canoe. Weighs 25#. Is an AGM battery that does not spill. Paid $106 delivered from Amazon.ca in July. Use a 30# Minn kota and ran it on speed 5 for 75 minutes for about 7km down a lake (2 in canoe and fishing gear). Speed was 6.2km/hr at the start, and 4.6km/hr at the end. Use speeds 2-3 when moving around lakes Bass fishing and it lasts all day. My 5 year old portable fishfinder came with a Powersonic battery and it is still going strong, thus the Powersonic purchase for the trolling motor. Would not use a motor larger than 30# with this (small) battery."
868517,Wagoneer,2014-08-20 19:46:00,118,"Lithium-ion 12v batteries are by far the lightest on the market by a massive margin. They're used in extreme racing cars where weight is everything. But they're also $$$ and not worth it unless you're in a situation where every single pound counts.  I have a class 27 kirkland battery (largest deep cycle they make) and it's not too bad at just over 50lbs. Pretty much any flooded cell acid battery is going to be in the same ball park. AGM is a bit lighter, but again not really worth twice the money to save 5-10lbs if you ask me. Costco is the best value for 12V batteries in Ontario right now.  Don't get hung up on brands and whatever they claim the battery weighs on the internet. There are only about 3 major companies that make batteries and are rebranded by other companies. Just takes some light research on the internet to find out who makes a certain battery."
868518,Wagoneer,2014-08-20 19:47:00,118,"  Sorry, quoted instead of edited."
868532,Terry,2014-08-20 20:44:00,14456,"for me weight was everything, thats why I went with the battery I  got 26lbs but did cost almost twice the money when trying to balance my toon the 50 lbers just did not work"
868537,misfish,2014-08-20 21:13:00,29133," And for sure,wont work for me.  I have a line on one.   Thanks for all the great replies all.  OFC rocks as always."
867285,misfish,2014-08-12 21:00:00,29133,"Im looking for a 12 volt SEALED  deep cycle battery. What do you know  that,s out on the market? Price as well.  Thanks"
867286,BillM,2014-08-12 21:03:00,17367,Deep cycle?  You aren't going to find something much lighter then what's already out there..   maybe a AGM but you'll pay for it... Is that worth 15lbs?  Probably not.
867288,misfish,2014-08-12 21:06:00,29133,"Thanks Bill,fixed.LOL  15 POUNDS would be great."
867289,Fisherman,2014-08-12 21:07:00,7201,"Just up the road from you bro, Total battery, everything from 1.3 amps on up."
867291,Joeytier,2014-08-12 21:09:00,3990,"You can find small one, but if you're going to be using it for a TM on the toon, you'll kill it pretty quickly.  (Cycling it down too low over and over).  I would go to a battery shop and buy a proper capacity deep cycle and make it work"
867292,BillM,2014-08-12 21:09:00,17367,"Thanks Bill,fixed.LOL  15 POUNDS would be great.  No no, I meant a savings of 15lbs   You'll still be lugging around a 50lb battery, lol!"
867293,davey buoy,2014-08-12 21:12:00,5505,"I know what your up to  ,what does your partner use??,I think something small as said won't last long."
867297,misfish,2014-08-12 21:19:00,29133," You'll still be lugging around a 50lb battery, lol!  Not the one that my fishing partner has.   LOL Davey  Im just looking around.  200 bucks for a battery like the one he has, is a bit steep for me right now."
867302,DRIFTER_016,2014-08-12 21:31:00,10439,"Thanks Bill,fixed.LOL  15 POUNDS would be great.  That's weight savings over a standard deep cycle.  What do you want to use the battery for?"
867303,Terry,2014-08-12 21:31:00,14456,optima yellow top  26 lbs  and as  misfish said  200 bucks
867305,BillM,2014-08-12 21:34:00,17367,Wow 26lbs is great.
867309,misfish,2014-08-12 21:39:00,29133," That's weight savings over a standard deep cycle.  What do you want to use the battery for?  My toon Dave. Not for every outing though.  Just want to be versatile. Say like in the spring when the water is way to cold for flipping my way around. I have built a platform to attach to the toon. The battery will sit mostly on the pontoon so it has solid support. Also has rod holders on it and a place to put a small cooler that I can have ice packs in it for keeping a feed of fish if I desire.. It,s pretty cool. Just waiting to finish it up then going to test it out. The biggest issue is,I have the entry level toon, (kind of rushed in on a good deal)so it,s not like Terrys beast, where he has everything including the kitchen sink.. The only thing missing,is an out house.LMAO"
867313,DRIFTER_016,2014-08-12 21:54:00,10439,I just run a group 24 deep cycle on mine. It's about 50#'s though.  
867314,Terry,2014-08-12 22:06:00,14456,and I weigh a pound or 2 lighter then BRIAN
867319,misfish,2014-08-12 22:27:00,29133,and I weigh a pound or 2 lighter then BRIAN   Ahhhhhhhhhhh ya. When you get out of the pool with your cloths on.LOL
867320,misfish,2014-08-12 22:29:00,29133,I just run a group 24 deep cycle on mine. It's about 50#'s though.     Dave  Do run yours like this? It makes sense some what?  
867325,DRIFTER_016,2014-08-12 22:42:00,10439,Makes sense. I run mine in forward not reverse though. That way I have the multiple forward speeds I can use. They run theirs reversed so they have multiple reverse speeds to help pulling sturgeon away from structure I believe. I like the use of the oars as rudders. I'll have to remember that.
867329,Terry,2014-08-12 22:50:00,14456,I use my oars as rudders not as much as they do but to counter the  effects of side wind or waves and to just make it a more stable\strait ride most times i just use my flipper  to steer
867330,bare foot wader,2014-08-12 22:51:00,1354, I like the use of the oars as rudders. I'll have to remember that.  why not just mount a terrova with ipilot and use the remote?...
867332,misfish,2014-08-12 23:18:00,29133," why not just mount a terrova with ipilot and use the remote?...   LOL  It,s a toon, Trying to keep it as simple as possible. With a small added luxury.  ."
867334,Joeytier,2014-08-12 23:24:00,3990,Would sure help with trolling LOL
867335,davey buoy,2014-08-12 23:26:00,5505,Would sure help with trolling LOL Now your on to something  lol.
867336,John Bacon,2014-08-12 23:49:00,3277,Have you considered a lithium ion battery?  They are much lighter.  Your wallet will be lighter too so you save even more weight
867337,DRIFTER_016,2014-08-13 00:17:00,10439,I wonder what my toon will do if I strap my 4hp Merc on the back.
867400,Fish4Eyes,2014-08-13 14:46:00,1022,"Check costco. I bought the bigger size Kirkland battery and noticed it was easily half the weight of my old interstate, which was a smaller battery. Costco warranty and pricing are also factors."
