A full week exploring the river swinging streamers and skating mouse patterns for gigantic brookies - it doesn't get any better than that at least for me!  This time I'm going to spend a day checking out the Sutton ridges as well, a spectacular gorge connecting Sutton and Hawley Lakes.  My goal this time is to avoid all contact with polar bears."
868402,grimsbylander,2014-08-20 00:34:00,3016,"Except for the polar bear thing, I'm jealous AGAIN. Have a great trip and I'll look for to the report with the pretty pictures!"

Good luck on your adventure although you won't need it.  There are some big brookies at the gorge (on the downstream side or Hawley Lake) and they are a totally different shade than the river fish.  Something like a Superior Coaster would be the best description, more silver than green.  When I was there 16 years ago, some of the guys caught 7-8 pounders there, so be aware.  The laker fishing away from the rocks was exceptional as well.  Hoping to get up there again sometime, but sadly no more personal floatplane."
