868779,turtle,2014-08-22 10:55:00,274,"I fish a cottage country shield lake for lakers. I choose cheqper lures because the lake bottom is snaggy.  3-5 inch spoons in gold. silver or combo work especially the hammered finishes. Spoons that are lighter so they drop slower and flutter on stops and turns. I use some of the old school Lucky Strike spoons like the ""Warden's Worry"" -i liked the name. Also minnow baits like bombers in natural colours work.  The darker and gray colours produce best, maybe looks like a baby laker that the bigger fish eat.  Agree that the fish are either on or off.  I typically get a hit in the first 15 minutes trolling or struggle for 2-3 hours.  I'd add that the locals run either steel or copper with a gang troll, large spoon with no hook and a minnow threaded onto a dropper look."
868892,danc,2014-08-22 23:53:00,4677,"Anything shiny that wobbles while trolled will catch Lake Trout. I'd pay more attention to boat speed, and how your lure of choice reacts to boat speed, than solely what's on the end of your line. Biggest Lake Trout that I've seen caught was 34 lbs. on an inch and a half green and brown muddler pattern crank bait. Nothing shiny about it, but it was in the right place at the right time. As a side note, it was caught on an ultra light with 6 lb. test. and would have smashed the current c&r line class record at the time, had it been kept and recorded. Another interesting moment that I had with Lakers was a few years back in late May when there was a huge mayfly hatch occurring. Being late May in northwestern Ontario, the fish were up high, but they were gorging on mayflies. Ever fly fished with a spinning rod? We did that day and slayed them. Like any other fish, it's not a magic lure that will catch them. It's understanding and knowing what the fish are up to on the day that you are there."
868899,4x4bassin,2014-08-23 01:48:00,1025,"I fish mostly shield lakes as well and lake trout can be very picky at times so like others have said when there on , there on and when there off , there off . I am a firm believer in fishing with the lightest line possible as well , lake trout might be a little short in the smarts department but they have excellent vision . Just last month I was up north fishing lake trout and we were all nailing them , my partner broke off a fish and he didn't tie a flouro leader back on but just tied direct to his braid . Guess what , no more fish for him until he tied that leader back on !!! As for lures that I find to be good on my lakes  : Red and Silver Williams Trophy Spoon , Red and Gold Cleo and just this past spring I couldn't keep them off of a Rapala Silver Husky Jerk ( 3 inch ) Good luck !  Here are a couple pictures of some of the lures I use in my lake trout waters    The williams spoon in this picture has a streamer fly tied to it ( works when things slow down ) The jigs I use when I can locate a bunch on the finder (usually in the summer months)  "

868286,BillM,2014-08-19 02:47:00,17367,"Another tip, don't troll straight   Lakers are notorious followers like Brian said, they also don't turn on a lure when they hit (This is why they never release the clip fully)..   Zigzag is the name of the game.   Also, if you're seeing fish and they aren't hitting the riggers, drop a jig on their heads and fish them vertically (then you can play the cat and mouse game)   I had to do that today, worked out well in the Sound."
868294,scuro2,2014-08-19 03:52:00,904,"Flutter spoon - thin...my go to lure.  The lakers seem to be moody, reflective tape at times works wonderful, but then again not. Flutter spoons, AC shinners, and even the rapella's with the little blade at the front worked beautifully in choppy sunny weather. Then there is flasher and dodger question. Lakers are tough because you have to find depth, location, speed, and what razzle turns their crank. Now if you are monster hunting the game changes and huge spoons and giant swim baits are the ticket. A good laker fishermen will get on fish if they are there because they know lakers moods like they know the moods of their wife.In a nutshell I go with the spirit of the day tells you and reflect that with panache in what I present Mr and Mrs Laker. I tweak all the time."
868302,Wagoneer,2014-08-19 05:35:00,118,"For downrigging lakers I have my go-to lure.

As long as you adjust your lures according to water conditions, I.E. brighter stuff when the water is murky just so the fish can see it, you are probably going to have a decent day.  Same goes with Lakers, ive caught a relatively small one on a massive 5 of diamonds in the middle of the afternoon, while on another day ive fished for 10 hours in ""perfect laketrout conditions"" and marked and dragged past fish all day and never had a nibble.  just like when the pickerels are biting, the same spot will skunk you one day and bring in 20 in an hour the next."

You'll have to supply the leader material , hooks and baiting needle. The top images and technique is very similar to what I do, but I just sew the mouth shut rather than the addition hook, I'm sure their method is equally good. They say the minnow must never spin, true to a point , you don't want the body arched till you get a fast spin but I prefer a very slow roll at trolling speed rather than running straight line.  http://www.michigansportsman.com/Tips_n_Trix/sewn_minnows.htm  The cut herring approach would be good if using larger baits.
