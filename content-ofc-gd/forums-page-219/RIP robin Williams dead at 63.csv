867193,Spanky80,2014-08-12 09:29:00,152,"Sad news...I remember Robin Williams on Johnny Carson back in the early nineties, hilarious."
867196,misfish,2014-08-12 10:09:00,29133,"WOW Thats so sad.  He again another gone to early. We all see the funny man on the outside,but dont know whats going on in the inside.  RIP MORK."
867200,Lucky Linda,2014-08-12 10:32:00,93,Depression...serious illness. Very very sad to have the whole world see you as such a star and not be able to beat depression.  Such a brilliant actor and comedian. My favourite was Mrs.Doubtfire but remember watching Mork and Mindy and loved his stand up on golf.  May he rest in peace.

867210,bushart,2014-08-12 12:01:00,2628,This is very sad  It somewhat reminds me of when John Lennon was taken unexpectedly ....the very best in the world at what they do....and then gone in a blink

867256,Old Ironmaker,2014-08-12 16:28:00,8243,"The saying "" Money can't buy you happiness "" comes to mind.  His stand up when he explains Golf is the best I ever saw. "" How many times do you have to do this?"" 18 F'n times!!!!!!!!"

867503,spincast,2014-08-14 01:03:00,3279,"he was one of the funniest, most talented of a generation, and its unlikely we will see someone with his range of talents again. Thanks for the laughs Robin and may you find peace at last."
867669,Fisherpete,2014-08-14 22:22:00,1814,"Very sad, I grew up watching his movies and his stand up was second to none. A brilliant mind coupled with charisma and wit. It was mentioned today on the news that he was beginning to suffer from the early stages of Parkinsons."
