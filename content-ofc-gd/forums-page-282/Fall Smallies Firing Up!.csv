807099,EC1,2013-09-10 15:37:00,930,"Had a weekend day up at my buddies cottage up in Bancroft, and was super excited to go up as I've heard from my friends that don't fish very often that they caught quite a few smallmouth on a senko.  Myself, on the other hand was excited about using jerkbaits and having fish chase - so that is what I threw the majority of the day. Trying out my new jerkbait 100 from Duo Realis, I can honestly say that Duo is becoming one of my favourite brands in terms of hard baits. The day was windy, and controlling the boat with a trolling motor in the back of the boat became quite a hassle. The problem was, it seemed that the fish bit much better if there was wind compared to it being flat calm.  Here's a video of the few jerkbait fish that I was able to catch on camera. The last fish that I lost was easily a 4 pounder - too bad I never got another one that size on camera. At least I was glad that I put the rest of my buddies onto a few fish - mainly on senkos and swimbaits.  http://youtu.be/5TyNpQOpggo"

807109,frozen-fire,2013-09-10 16:49:00,542,Nice! You are the last person I would expect to take vids.
807118,MJL,2013-09-10 17:52:00,2427,Nice vid Edwin. Which model of GoPro are you using? This winter can we try dropping it 120ft down into Simcoe?   X2...I'm surprised in this 3 minute video you didn't manage to hook or cut yourself. Your blood is still on my auger handle and it won't come off
807220,Richie Razor,2013-09-11 01:14:00,536,What's the deal with this lure? Seems like it would be a good spring pickeral lure

807520,EC1,2013-09-12 16:24:00,930,"Mike, the camera is not mine, ask youngone  and fishindevil, which crank are we talking about? Definitely need to learn how to crank within the next year. I've put it off for way too long."
807644,shimano19,2013-09-13 12:26:00,196,Where do they carry those duo lures?
807647,MJL,2013-09-13 12:35:00,2427, That camera has already been to the bottom of Simcoe then.LOL
807683,fishnsled,2013-09-13 18:16:00,3520,"Nice video Edwin and good fishing!!   The electric motor, is that a Minn Kota MX65 with the Maximizer  built in?  If so that is the very first electric motor I bought and still have it and works just fine."
