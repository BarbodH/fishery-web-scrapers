807263,Old Ironmaker,2013-09-11 07:21:00,8243,"If my 2 cents count my boat that is close to 20 years old has always been stored outside. It has been shrink wrapped annually since new. Mothballs help but I block the rear opening with a small tarp, very tightly. A cover or tarp not tight can rub against the vehicle or boat thousands of times a day if flapping in the wind and take the paint off to the metal or wear right into the fiberglass. Happened to a buddy years ago when he put a loose tarp on his brand new Alfa. When he took the tarp off in the spring the tarp had taken the paint off to the steel on the fenders hood and boot.  I hate storing anything in a barn, unless you want your wiring harness and cables used as nesting materials for rats and mice. Never a barn. Learned that lesson the hard way when I had to rewire my Harley 12 years ago. Yes I put in a box of mothballs.  A good coat of wax before storage is key for me. I oil the trailer by hand, takes a few minutes at most. I park it on the lawn and done like dinner. I might jack it this year and store the new trailer tires.  Rich makes a good point they are made for the outdoors. As far as protecting a 20K or more investment, look in your drive way and count the money of the cars and trucks you have when bought new. Probably close to 80 grand for 2 vehicles new."
807269,lew,2013-09-11 09:53:00,12766," Perhaps you missed my reply earlier in this thread where I said I stored my boat in a barn for many years with absolutely ZERO issues, along with 6 or 7 other boats as well.  Just because you had issues doesn't mean everyone does.  Do you honestly think your boat will be safe from critters just because it's stored outside under a tarp or even shrink wrapped ??  I know a guy who thought the same as you, that barns were unsafe places to store boats, so he left his beside his cottage and covered it. When he opened it up in the spring the raccoons had destroyed the interior.  Critters can get in anywhere, specially mice, so we just do what we can and hope for the best."
807273,Rich,2013-09-11 10:26:00,3927,Im not sure what you're upset about here.. he does it differently and you believe that's wrong?
807274,lew,2013-09-11 10:32:00,12766," I didn't say he was wrong at all Rich, go back and read what I said again.  The man said to never store anything in a barn because he had trouble with mice, I simply stated that I had used a barn for many years without ANY issues."
807279,BillM,2013-09-11 11:13:00,17367,"Reading comprehension seems to be an issue in this thread, lol."
807300,JoshS,2013-09-11 13:14:00,729,"I stored my boat in a barn last year with around 6-7 bowls of mouthballs. When I pulled my boat out, I found around 10 total mouse droppings... seems they went in and left. Hopefully that happens again."
807313,BillM,2013-09-11 15:07:00,17367,"I use bounce sheets in the Lund, nothing but a great smelling boat the next time the cover comes off!"
807320,lew,2013-09-11 15:34:00,12766,I've got several of these electrical doo-dads in the garage to keep critters out and so far I've never had even so much as a mouse....touch wood.  
807331,Tybo,2013-09-11 17:07:00,1373,I lived in homes where the boat only went into the garage when in use.In winter storage the boat got tarp and stored outside. I have better useage for a garage then too store a boat.Never had a issue and I`m on boat # 12.
807388,John Bacon,2013-09-11 23:14:00,3277,"Is there any reason why a boat would need to be ""professionally wrapped"" for outside storage as some have recommended?  I have stored mine outdoors under a tarp without any issues.  I have a 14' 2x6"" board that I use along with some brackets designed to make horses.  This makes are very solid 'A' frame for the tarp."
807389,Old Ironmaker,2013-09-11 23:16:00,8243,"Lew,  I didn't miss your post, I just don't agree with you, at all. I'm glad you haven't had any issues with storing in a barn. After I got the bill for my year old bike I swore I would never store in a barn again. It was the first time I ever had damage to a vehicle in 40 years storing cars, bikes and boats all outdoors. I don't have the bike anymore and still say never store in a farmers barn. The next year I stored it in the sunroom to my wife's utter delight. Better than storing it in the dinning room we never used. All the guys thought it looked pretty cool siting in the corner, the women less so.  My opinion only Lew.  Johnny D"
807396,lew,2013-09-11 23:30:00,12766, And your certainly entitled to that Johnny
807402,Rizzo,2013-09-11 23:59:00,4754,have been doing the barn thing for years. Only problem I ever had was birds pooping on my cheap tarp that covered the good one. I did jack it up and take the tires off to deter theft. My sister (where I keep the boat) goes away for the whole month of December. I figured better safe than sorry.
807404,SlowPoke,2013-09-12 00:24:00,2984,"Pro wraps are pretty much worry free. Woven tarps (typical blue and brown variety) get thin and weak from UV damage and don't like to be stretched over corners. Without stretching tight, snow tends to stick and you have to keep an eye on it. That's not to say you can't build a good frame and use a quality tarp. I elect to store indoors and save the build time, material expense and storage of materials in the off season."
806969,Bigfisherman,2013-09-09 18:11:00,100,"I might be finally throwing in the towel to my search to find a boat only a foot bigger(then my 16ft) that might fit in my current garage. I realize that if I store outside I can open up my options 100 fold and get a bigger safer boat. So I was thinking I can add some stones to the side of the house and store a boat there.(I have room and worst case I can move it down to an outside storage place 5 mins away during the winter months)  So my Q is for those ppl that store their boats outside are there any cons? other then the obvious(theft,  animals getting in, etc) Boat will most likely be new/new last years model or slightly used very low hours depending what I find and how much I get for my current boat.  Just want to hear ppl's experiences and thoughts obviously this will be long term.  Thanks "
806970,leaf4,2013-09-09 18:20:00,2466,"my dad has a 15' tinny and he's been storing it outside, upside down for the past 10 years no real downside other than it gets dirty, but what's a pressure washer for anyway haha"
806972,BillM,2013-09-09 18:28:00,17367,"If I was going to spend some decent $$$ on a boat, there's no way I'd store it outside, lol."
806976,DanD,2013-09-09 18:58:00,2223,"If you’re stuck storing it outside, have it professionally shrink wrapped and you should be good. Shrink wrap installed correctly with bracing for it not to collapse (due to snow load) and vented properly, it’s as good as being inside a non heated barn.  Dan."
806977,quickme,2013-09-09 18:59:00,261,I had this discussion with my neighbor last month and this was his solution  http://www.etrailer.com/Trailer-Coupler/Fulton/FHDPB330301.html  I haven't used is before but this would be the only way he could fit his 16ft alum. in his garage.  He's planning on installing it late October so if you haven't found a solution yet i'll let you know how it goes.   nick
806979,lew,2013-09-09 19:12:00,12766,If there's any farms around your area go talk to the farmer about keeping it in his barn. There's lots of farms around the Kawartha area offering outdoor storage and many that have indoor as well.  I stored my boat in a barn for years and the most I ever payed was $150 for the entire winter. Couple bowls of moth balls left inside and I never once had a critter problem of any kind.
806981,Dan668,2013-09-09 19:25:00,1120,"I store mine outdoors in my yard. Built an A frame, put a heavy duty tarp over it. Air can come in. A few bounce sheets. No problems."
806982,Bigfisherman,2013-09-09 19:25:00,100," Ya this is my concern I'm planning on spending 25>30k, so its hard for me to just leave it outside if you know what I mean but I can't fit anything bigger then a 17ft in my 19ft garage:(  Thanks for the info I will check how much the winter storage would cost as I think my best bet would be to leave it at my place for the summer then wrap & store for the winter pending cost but i guess you have to pay to play."
806985,Dan668,2013-09-09 19:35:00,1120,"I spent the same. And keep it outdoors 24/7. Third year, dont see anything wrong with it."
806986,lew,2013-09-09 19:43:00,12766," There's thousands of VERY   expensive yachts shrink wrapped and stored outside every winter with no problems and there won't be any with a tin boat either. As DanD suggested, just be sure it's done by an expert and you'll have no worries."
806988,Bigfisherman,2013-09-09 20:06:00,100, Very good point:) Thanks for everyone's advice much appreciated.
806996,Rattletrap2,2013-09-09 20:49:00,1652,"I stored mine outside for many years without any issues. I did keep those little tinfoil trays with moth balls all over and in all the compartments and such. Beside your house, it is less likely to attract a family of coons moving in. keep an eye on it over the winter and it will be fine. Make sure you build  a good cover out of wood and tarps or get it shrink wrapped as suggested. I brought all my gear, tackle, and electronics indoors as well.  Good luck and enjoy the new boat!"
807002,SlowPoke,2013-09-09 21:38:00,2984,"My 20' boat and full size truck are stored indoors Dec-April for $75/mo The rest of the year, the boat and truck live in the driveway. I have a full travel cover for the boat and have not had any issues but I don't leave my gear inside or leave the Terrova mounted."
807003,SlowPoke,2013-09-09 21:41:00,2984,It's cheaper to store indoors than to wrap my boat but a good wrap is nothing to be concerned about. Not to tight & proper venting are the key.
807005,mike rousseau,2013-09-09 22:24:00,4661,So I have a question to all you indoor fellas...  What's the big deal with storing outside...??? Winter summer spring or fall... It's all the same...  Buy a good cover... make sure you have support for the cover...Clear snow off every time you shovel your driveway... And put moth balls or bounce sheets in to keep mice out....  I know I'd buy the boat I really want... And if it doesn't fit in my garage (if I had a garage) I'd get a good boat cover or get one of those portable garage thingys that go on sale all the time... Problem solved....
807059,SlowPoke,2013-09-10 04:17:00,2984,"I've done indoor and outdoor, indoor wins hands down. I value my time at higher rate than the price of storage. When the price of storage exceeds that then I'll look at other options."
807098,mike rousseau,2013-09-10 15:33:00,4661,But would you let indoor storage dictate what boat you buy...???
807107,BillM,2013-09-10 16:38:00,17367," I would.... If you can drop 20k on a boat, you can afford the $300 it might cost you a winter for indoor storage.   Lots of people out there just waiting to rip you off."
807108,mike rousseau,2013-09-10 16:47:00,4661,That's what insurance is for....  No?
807110,BillM,2013-09-10 16:50:00,17367," I think it's more along the lines of common sense.   It's like guys that drop 40k on a new car and refuse to spend $800 on snow tires, then end up in the ditch."
807112,mike rousseau,2013-09-10 17:07:00,4661,Or a truck in the ditch with 4x4 not engaged to same gas... Lol...   Common sense tells me that the middle of winter is the least likely time to have a boat stolen....  If you think this way everyone should have their boats stored indoors year round....  All the boats/motors I've ever heard of being stolen were in the spring/summer....     To the OP...  If you have space in your driveway/yard... Get a good cover with supports... And if it makes you feel better... Put all the snow you get all winter in front of it... Then the theives would need heavy equipment to get her out through the ice and snow...  Don't get me wrong... I wish I had a garage to keep my boat... But that would never influence what boat I buy....    ...
807121,Sinker,2013-09-10 17:55:00,8692,"I've been storing my boat outside for 20 yrs with no issues. All my issues happen when I'm using the boat, not storing it.  I live in an area where I don't have to worry too much about getting ripped off too much, but jacking the trailer up and. Taking the wheels off helps with theft!  S."
807184,SlowPoke,2013-09-10 23:23:00,2984,I bought what I wanted and found a solution. I've been storing boats indoors for years now so I guess it's a matter of deciding that's your storage method and buying the boat you want. It gets to a point where the boat is too big for the garage but still small enough for the driveway and the cost of a wrap exceeds the cost of indoor storage. I don't want to waste my time building a frame and tarp system or keeping snow and ice off.
807211,Rich,2013-09-11 00:54:00,3927,Common sense would dictate to me that a vehicle built specifically for outdoor use could handle the outdoors.
807262,porkpie,2013-09-11 06:46:00,2521,"Check your town or cities zoning bylaw before getting a nastygram when one of your nosy neighbors decides to gripe about your boat stored outside to the city.  As for outdoor storage, I've done it for years, no issues."
