Tried very hard for walleyes, but my fishing bud was the only walleye slayer of the trip with two nice ones. Caught enough small bass, but only a few pic worthy ones. We stayed at the smaller linked cottages at Burleigh Falls. We've stayed there before and have been quite happy with the place. Btw the big place is still for sale. Here's some pics. Thanks for looking.          I ended up catching a PB smallie on the Wedensday in a tight inlet in the thick weeds. Man was it ever dark in colour."

I live just 3 miles down the road from where you stayed and even though that lodge is still for sale, the restaurant is open and the food is fantastic. If you stay in the cabins again you should head over for supper.  We go there quite often, infact we were there last night, and have never been disappointed yet."

Wings and a few games of pool as a matter of fact. I've always had top notch service in there and no complaints from me. We always bring food and use the BBQ, just to keep the price at bay lol. But that's cool you go there and know if it."

I'd sleep in the back of my 70' Thunderbird, which was tricky because if anyone is old enough to remember it had an oval back seat. After I bought a Vette I had to up a fiver for a campsite. The $5.00 they wanted at Lovesick Lake camp for a site cut into our drinking money so in our cars we slept. Those were the days kids drove sports cars not like now where almost everyone with convertibles have grey hair and a larger waistline.  Went over the Falls more than once, by accident. It's only about 20 feet but it still hurt, and left a mark  And yes that is one nice smallie and she is as dark as a bronze back can get. Larger than any caught 40 years ago if it was on Lovesick you got her."
807932,danc,2013-09-16 04:27:00,4677,Nice pics and report. Just one thing though. I'm a smoker too but you'll never see me holding a fish with a butt hanging out of my mouth. It's just not right for some reason.
808037,pidge,2013-09-16 23:10:00,438,"Smokem if ya gotem Danny:) lol. I usually don't, but hey!  Nice story Ironmaker been there done that... I've fished Lovesick a few times, but never caught more than Rockies and the odd small small mouth. I'm certain there's big fish, but the Gods wernt shining down on me those two trips out there. Nice lake though."
