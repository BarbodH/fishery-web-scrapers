I only managed two small musky biggest around 38"" the other I shook off boat side   John headed home Saturday night taking his first place trophy and new high of his Personal Best 48.5""X21"" with him. That was for the better as Mother Nature had other plans for LSC in the Morning the wind was howling from the North with 4' waves crashing the south shore.I stayed home to build lures as the winds were supposed to calm down around 7pm. I made the choice around 4pm to head out fishing and battle the big waves. What normally takes 4 min to drive my boat to this spot took me 25 min but it paid off. I landed a nice 47""X18"" and one cast later a awesome 51""X21"" both fish on my new brown frog handlebarz what a great way to end the weekend. I just wish my wife was not sick and could have been there to net my fish I did miss her out there.      Well its 5:04 Im done reporting this now its time to meet up with another member of the Belle River Chapter of Muskies Canada and see if we can put some more slime in the boat I love having weekdays off work as the boat traffic will be minimal."
