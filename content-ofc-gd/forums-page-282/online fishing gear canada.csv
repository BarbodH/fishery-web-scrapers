807298,Ralph Field,2013-09-11 13:01:00,1018,"Two Canadian site to consider would be www.fishheadscanada.net and www.centerpinangling.com , but I haven't used them for walleye gear."
807302,adempsey,2013-09-11 13:25:00,1498,"This might help you a bit.  Not sure if there are stores listed, but manufacturers are and they often have online stores and lists of resellers.  http://ontariofishingcommunity.com/forums/index.php?showtopic=46973&hl=%2Bmade+%2Bcanada  Here is the list of resellers from XZone Lures site:  http://w.xzonelures.com/?page_id=66  Plenty of websites listed there.  There's always LeBaron and Sail as well."
807427,Richie Razor,2013-09-12 03:04:00,536,"Centerpin angling is my go to site for specialty steelhead gear, but for other purchases I just order from the states. Even after duty, shipping, and taxes, you can still save a ton."
807429,Duckie,2013-09-12 03:22:00,305,cabelas.ca might work  cabelas now has a canadian site and they are opening a store in barrie next year according to the website.  I still order off of cabelas.com and they send stuff usually in about 4 days but I do have to pay for the shipping which is a pain (eg. 14 $ for 5 rattlin rapalas etc)  but they are quick
