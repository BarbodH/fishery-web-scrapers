Unfortunately it'll be following a fairly severe cold front hitting on Friday.  Typically, we can't reschedule our plans around the weather!  We'll focus fishing efforts on the Sunday, which allows for what appears to be the more severe post-frontal day to pass on Saturday.  I'd really appreciate any tips or suggestions on locating fish.  I've read that I should either fish deep or tight to structure, or also to fish under the densest vegetation mats I can find if I target some largies as well.  Was thinking about drop shotting or slip floating some live minnows and worms.  I haven't fished the Kawarthas much in my day, so any tips would be much appreciated.  Cheers,  MoB"
