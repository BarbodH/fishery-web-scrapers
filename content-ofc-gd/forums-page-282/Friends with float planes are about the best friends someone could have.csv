807065,chris.brock,2013-09-10 07:31:00,4053,"My buddy Cam and cottage neighbor, recently got his pilot's license, and float rating.  He showed up at the cottage with a Cessna 172, in Deep Bay (Gull Lake, Haliburton), and took me up for a cruise     Although being a new pilot, he seemed competent and confident, and I didn't feel nervous    here's looking into Deep Bay    looking south on Gull Lk, towards Moores Falls    the landfill on Deep Bay Road    we also checked out some lakes we don't want to mention  I have a feeling we might hit a few back lake bass next season  "
807066,Stoty,2013-09-10 08:05:00,2910,"Very cool! Gull Lake looks beautiful! I've never been there before, but might have to make the trip up there one of these days."
807070,corvette1,2013-09-10 09:36:00,1765,awesome pictures chris your right it is good to have friends in the right places.
807071,solopaddler,2013-09-10 09:56:00,8605,"Wow Chris, that's cool for sure! The possibilities are endless."
807072,danc,2013-09-10 10:45:00,4677,That's the ultimate toy for sure.
807083,Cast-Away,2013-09-10 13:10:00,790,"Was that his plane Chris, or did he rent it?"
807086,chris.brock,2013-09-10 13:55:00,4053," he doesn't own the plane, he joined a small club that has 2 planes (1 on wheels, 1 on floats), the planes can be signed out and the rates are reasonable"
807090,BillM,2013-09-10 14:16:00,17367,"Man that's killer.  Time to get my pilots license!  (ok not really, but think of the possibilities!)"
807097,crappieperchhunter,2013-09-10 15:24:00,2582,Boys and there toys  How painfully obvious is it that I'm jealous.
807104,fishindevil,2013-09-10 16:18:00,6254,did you happen to see a 20ft lund pro V ?? MY BUDDY AND I WERE THERE FISHING THE ENTIRE DAY !!!! sorry bout the caps...
807114,chris.brock,2013-09-10 17:11:00,4053," the only boat I remember seeing, was a large aluminum fishing boat (I didn't catch the make), it caught my attention because of the cool camo pattern paint job, you guys?  did u see us buzzing around?  how did you do (fish)?"
807119,Jds63,2013-09-10 17:53:00,1365,"very nice Chris, that beach looks familiar ... (Miners Bay ?)  a friend of mine took me on a flight over Algonquin Park a few years ago, photographed a few secret lakes as well ..."
807128,irishfield,2013-09-10 18:39:00,26272,"Nice Chris! Most won't even let you chip in for fuel... ""because they're going there anyways"". It's the way I operate and just happy to be airborne or on a back lake. Does the Lake St. John Flying club let them tie a canoe on?... or are you going to be looking at using cache boat lakes?"
807131,adempsey,2013-09-10 18:54:00,1498,Too cool.  That's a step above for sure.   Look forward to hearing about your adventures!
807141,chris.brock,2013-09-10 20:09:00,4053, that's the launch at Deep Bay   I was thinking of using cached boats and caching 1 or 2 this winter via snowmobile
807157,Shloim,2013-09-10 20:58:00,515,Does your friend need any more friends? Im very handy and have tools....
