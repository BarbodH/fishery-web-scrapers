Not a bad thing; it's how I found the site and there's a TON of great info here. Just something to keep in mind when sharing specifics on a location."
807150,fishnsled,2013-09-10 20:31:00,3520,"Great thread to dig up the old video for Rob, thanks.  Some of us do look younger Brian, I don't think you or I have changed at all...lol!  I've met a lot of great people off of this board and mostly do to just getting out to the GTG's shortly after I first started.  Ya there can be a lot of crap on the board but there is a lot of good as well and for the most part we are a good group.  There hasn't been a ""big"" GTG for a while and this is where perhaps the ""cliques"" have come in as people have broken off into smaller groups for one reason or another.  There will most likely be some form of a Fall Quinte GTG.  Likely we'll be spread out over a couple of weekends and venues.   Come out to one of them and make some new friends.    Still regretting that day eh Joe?     Certainly glad to have you as a great friend Joe.....You were talking about me weren't you??  As for the rules, they are there to keep things somewhat under control.  Are they perfect, nope but needed as some kind of a guide.  If you saw the first days of the board you would know why they are needed."

807159,Richie Razor,2013-09-10 21:16:00,536,"Wow I guess someone here isn't too keen on the opinion of others - can we all see where this notion of the ""old boys club"" that some have of this board? I've just joined this board, and I think it's great, just from my lurking days it seems that some of the older members always have the voice of reason on topics which I can respect.  What I don't respect are idiotic comments made from some of the veteran members such as above - how do you expect further board involvement through posts or meet-ups with such a low-brow attitude?  I mean I've read through the posts and understand how things work here better now since I joined, and want to be more involved through posts and reports and such, but the negativity of some (joking posts aside) really is a turn off."
807162,Richie Razor,2013-09-10 21:24:00,536," You know what, I'm going to assume that your handle on this board would relate to your method of fishing - you like to float fish for salmon and steelhead with a million dollar set-up, and carry an holier than thou attitude. Makes total, complete sense."
807164,ch312,2013-09-10 21:35:00,1590," I've been around here for a while and couldn't agree more. While some days you can get easily frustrated reading what some people (including a couple mods) post ,I keep coming back because it's an excellent site overall. Learning to ignore a few select folks is key, just like at work, family functions, etc."

807213,RiverGuy,2013-09-11 00:59:00,19,I am a newbie here and I'm still kinda new to Canada as I immigrated here from California. That being said I don't post a lot but I do read a lot of the posts here. I don't know a lot about fishing here in Canada but I am learning and this place has been great for me because I didn't know the ins and outs of what type of baits to use and setups to use etc. there are a lot of great people here and there is a ton of knowledge here on the site. I do plan on going to events so i can meet people from here. I feel I know some of you just from reading your posts all the time but it would be nice to meet people in person. I am one of those people out there that doesn't know we're to go as far as fishing spots but that doesn't stop me from tring. I am on google maps all the time looking for areas around we're i live. As far as venturing out of my area I would be one of those people that would ask but only after doing research. And come to think of it i think I have asked but that was my fault for not doing my research first. But all in all I would like that thank all of you here for the help wether it be from responding to my posts or from me reading yours.  Thanks Steven

806844,frodobuggins,2013-09-08 21:12:00,127,"Hey all,  After reading the thread that was locked because someone asked about a shore fishing spot, i tried to find the rules, but couldn't. I'm a bit confused as whats allowed or not.  There are numerous threads about people naming fishing spots, or asking for spots, within a certain driving distance from wherever they may be. These are answered all the time. Was it because he was new? How many posts does a guy need to have that answered? 20? Seems kind of Arbitrary doesn't it? Heck, if he was like me, he probably was on here frequently as a guest for some time before joining. Maybe to him it felt like he could ask that question because he'd been on here so often before he joined.  There a numerous threads with detailed trip reports, with names, roads travelled and cabin features. I like reading these reports because they are trips im likely never going to take, so i get to live vicariously through them. Some of them are so detailed i wonder if the author gets something in the form of kickbacks from the lodge. ( Frankly, i don't care if they do. More power to them)  If so, i'm a bit confused as to why that would be allowed, but someone saying they caught a fish on a particular lure  (because of sponsorship or whatever) gets scolded.  I understand, this isn't really a public forum and that whoever runs it, moderates it, does so at their own discretion."
806845,Richie Razor,2013-09-08 21:19:00,536,It's the bro code in here man. No surprise there.

806851,Terry,2013-09-08 21:46:00,14456,bro code.....wonder if I will ever be one of the bros  I have been censored more then most. and around longer then most
806854,aplumma,2013-09-08 21:57:00,6896,The bro code is that the Moderators let some people get away with stuff and call others on it. Personally I yell at everyone that I CATCH doing something wrong. Some times it is lock the thread and other it is a P.M. It is not that we ignore some than others it is there is a lot to read here and we don't always catch it. If people used the report button when they see something instead of thinking their is a bro code they would be happier. If someone does not like the way they are treated they have the option of not coming to the site it really is that simple. If you like the site most of the time then stay and support the site and the moderators after all we are people doing a job that most don't want   Yup you get yelled at sometimes but you also go fishing with some of the moderators too. We like all of the members here each is treated as fairly as we know how to.  Art
806863,Sinker,2013-09-08 22:21:00,8692,"There is definitly a clique on this site. I've been around here for a long time, been locked out, banned, sworn at, called names.....you name it, but I still come back. Some days you can post gps locations, others you can't name a lake, it seems to just depend....  I agree with the OP though, I think the two locked threads were shut down for no good reason. Not a nice way to welcome a new member IMO. It could have been handles in a much nicer way.  Life goes on.........  S."
806864,bare foot wader,2013-09-08 22:30:00,1354,"it's a great site...to be a lurker....LOL  kind of true, but only if you're not thick skinned....forums can be especially rough on the newbies who haven't learned 'the way' yet   most steelhead and musky threads, posting estimated weights of fish, etc...just sit back and enjoy the show.....everybody is a keyboard expert"
806867,timmeh,2013-09-08 22:50:00,609,"I think there's a bit of common sense involved. Providing details on a far off trip is one thing cause you can't really do your own scouting, but if you're asking for info on close by spots most experienced guys expect you to do your own leg work. That's what they did."
806870,Twocoda,2013-09-08 23:25:00,4130,rules huh? never read them but i find out as i go .....lol (school of hard knocks)
806877,pics,2013-09-09 00:11:00,1268,"Being more of a lurker than poster doesn't help... Due to work, home projects, side jobs etc and the fact that my wife hates fishing sidelines my ability to go fishing... The fact that I'm going moose hunting in 2 weeks burns her ass as well.. Lol. I might even get some fishing in for an actual report.... Shore fishing spots in a big city?? I see both sides of it but most people who live and fish in the city know the spots so they aren't much of a secret..."
806908,Dave Bailey,2013-09-09 13:07:00,1641,"Revealing fishing spots is a judgement call that comes from experience.  If I pull in a nice fish at the base of Fenelon Falls, there's no way I'm going to be cryptic about it, because it's no secret. If you've never fished there you're probably posting from some remote village in Mongolia. I have no hesitation giving away spots at George Lake in Killarney PP, because the access is pretty well restricted to the people camping there, and there are no powerboats allowed. It's not like you're going to see hordes of guys heading up there with bass boats. But I have found a couple of nice spots that I'll keep to myself for now, one is in the ________ _______ ____ just off Highway ___, and another is way up north of ________ up a dirt road called ________ _____. Nice little restaurant near there called _______ ________, good lunches!"
806917,NAW,2013-09-09 14:14:00,4022,"Exactly.  It takes a little common sense.  I know it shouldn't, but it still shocks me that some people (Doofus for example) still don't understand the importance of posting specific details on fishing locations. Then to make it worse, they get confrontational when their posts gets locked....."
806921,Angler management,2013-09-09 14:50:00,280,"I think the confusion with new members starts with them having different expectations of a fishing forum. I would imagine a lot of ppl assume it would be a place where people share spots and techniques to catch more fish. From what i noticed here, its more about conserving good fishing spots. Also i would agree that it is mostly common sense, and 90% of people probably have never read the rules. I think that new members here get bullied a little by the old timers and moderators are less tolerant towards newer members. There was a nicer way to deal with the topic and not leave a sour taste in the newcomers mouth."
806926,Headhunter,2013-09-09 15:15:00,5703,"Almost all of us were new here at some time or other. I recall when I first joined, I felt like an outsider and was initially mocked. Thinking back, I probabaly deserved it! Consider the position of long time members and the never ending influx of ""new members"" all trying to make an impression or share knowledge. How many times has a long standing member given out info to a newbie only to have that come back and haunt them? I've seen it many times. So, here's a little secret for you newer members on how to become one of the ""old boys""... GET OUT THERE AND MEET FOLKS FROM THE BOARD. It's really that simple. I attended two gtg's early in my time here. At the first gathering, I met one guy here that I have fished with ever since and he has become one of my best friends since. My second GTG was at a fishing for Tyler event. I met pretty much all of the ""boys club"" there and as a result, was invited to personal cottages and future fishing trips. Why, because I was no longer a faceless name on an internet board. That's really all it takes! So, get off the keyboard, get yerself out there, meet some folks and grow your fishing network. Carping about your own lack of effort to make things happen will likely fall on deaf ears... HH"

There is not way to filter these people so newbies really have to work to gain some respect.  Its just like meeting people in person ( yes people still do that without a keyboard).  If I meet you for the first time will you tell me all your secrets?  NO!  Get to know me (everyone) and you'll get the answers you need when i'm ( we're) comfortable with you.
