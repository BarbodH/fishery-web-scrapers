807291,Steve Piggott,2013-09-11 12:26:00,196,Have been fishing lake Erie the last couple of weeks and the bass have been on fire.Tubes and slash baits have been working great as the bass put on feedbag. Followers Got to love the fall fishing.
807292,BillM,2013-09-11 12:27:00,17367,"Found the same lastnight on a local spot of mine.  Big fat bellies, hitting pretty much anything (We got 90% of our fish on topwaters over 30ft of water on steep drops)..  Gotta love this time of year!"
807322,OhioFisherman,2013-09-11 15:58:00,6623,"It was like 92 degrees here yesterday, Friday's high is supposed to be 60 degrees, that might signal them to really start the fall feed."

807453,bigvenison,2013-09-12 12:14:00,15,One of the best times to fish big SM Bass 5-6lbs is when the water temp hits 55F --usually around 10th of Oct --fish will be in shallow on rocky piles near shore --under 10'--they are searching for crayfish
807493,Steve Piggott,2013-09-12 14:58:00,196,Wind wise Saturday looks like the best day. Start shallow move deeper if needed .
