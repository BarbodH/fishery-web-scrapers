What's different about his, instead of simply tying or crimping the hardware on he actually takes the time to tie a nail knot then coats the knot with something (not sure what?).  I have another big trip coming up really soon and placed a rush order with him. He had them all made to my spec's and shipped to my door within 3 days and for an incredibly good price.  Just wanted to say thanks my friend, you really came through for me!  Here's hoping I can put them to good use."
807288,buick14,2013-09-11 12:04:00,741,Best leaders from fidel no lie.  Never had failure.
807303,highdrifter,2013-09-11 13:25:00,2534,"Thanks guys.  Mike, you've always come through for me so this was a no-brainer.  Feels good when chats turn into hook-ups, gear and craft are shared, and things come full circle.  Mark, you my homebrew!!  cheers HD"
807309,GbayGiant,2013-09-11 14:44:00,1780,That is very nice. I have never had a failure with a made or bought leader ever as well.
807335,BucktownAngler,2013-09-11 17:51:00,582,lets see some pics.  what type of hardware and leader material?
807338,laszlo,2013-09-11 18:08:00,487,I too have used Fidel's custom leaders. They're great!  Fidel and pike hunting go hand and hand. One of the best Pike Anglers I've ever met.  He really knows his Carp too!!! Wink Wink buddy.
807339,highdrifter,2013-09-11 18:22:00,2534, Fluoro is seagar blue label.  Loops are secured using 100lb braid and binded with brute force and a hardner.  Hardware is string-ease stay-lock snaps and swivels.  I'll send some pics later.  cheers HD
