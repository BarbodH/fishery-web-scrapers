807628,Stoty,2013-09-13 09:59:00,2910,"Hey all,  Had a buddy ask me a question about what type of paint to use if they wanted to touch up their lower unit? The first thing that came to mind for me was the ""high heat"" black spray paint that you can use on BBQ, etc. Would that be ok?  Are there certain types of paint that would work, or would any be ok?"
807632,krixxer,2013-09-13 10:16:00,274,For the most part I use epoxy primers with polyurethane topcoats.  This combo will go 10000 hours accelerated corrosion test (salt pray)
807637,aplumma,2013-09-13 11:16:00,6896,epoxy paint with a well prepared base will work great.   Art
807650,Muskieman,2013-09-13 12:49:00,2472,Another vote for Epoxy ..
807679,DRIFTER_016,2013-09-13 17:44:00,10439,You can actually buy outboard motor paint @ CT. I got a couple of cans of black for LU touch-ups.

807708,Nipfisher,2013-09-13 22:31:00,2449,"Is it more enjoyable when you paint your ""lower unit""?"
807713,Burtess,2013-09-13 22:53:00,901," 10,000hrs??  Do you mean NSS?  CASS?  Over what substrate (galvanized?  Zn plate?)  Burt"
807749,krixxer,2013-09-14 11:44:00,274,The test is done to ASTM B 117-07  We prepare the substrates in accordance with Mil Spec 8625 F .TyII Cl I (chromic acid anodizing)   
807753,Roy,2013-09-14 12:27:00,13728,Isn't it great? All kinds of members here with real skills willing to share their knowledge! Beautiful.
807784,Burtess,2013-09-14 17:26:00,901, Sorry hijack....  Have you ever tried some of the zirconium or trivalent chromium based pretreatments over Al?  If so what were your experiences with them?  Burt
807821,krixxer,2013-09-15 02:51:00,274,"Sure, Alodine 1200 I have a 600L tank of the stuff. We buy the flakes and make our own solution. Not as resilient as anodizing but if all you want is the paint to stick I'll does the trick quite well.  "
