My guess is an otter as the teeth marks suggest on the bottom of the fish. The other side of the fish had another round gash with a few nail holes in its side with lots of bruising. Nature's ""preditor/prey"" relationship.     "
806922,kickingfrog,2013-09-09 14:51:00,8333,Otter?
806925,BillM,2013-09-09 15:09:00,17367,That's going to be a giant otter with teeth marks like that!  I'd guess big laker/pike
806928,Musky or Specks,2013-09-09 15:47:00,2710,Did it make legal size so you could put it out of its misery? It is amazing that it still took a fly with all that damage.

806984,kickingfrog,2013-09-09 19:32:00,8333,Looks more mammal then fish but i don't know.
807155,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2013-09-10 20:47:00,0,i've seen otters over 25 lbs.  otter is a pretty good hypothesis IMO.

807234,BillM,2013-09-11 01:58:00,17367, Wow I had no idea they got that big.
