Nothing hammers your lure like a big musky. To the point it startles you when they smash it. Or seeing the monster follow up and attack your lure. I have been using Handlebarz double 10’s %95 of my last two trips. They are amazing, they make their lures with care and quality parts. I haven’t fished a double 10 nearly as nice. They also have pulled in lots of big fish and always get action . I hit Lake St. Clair twice this week with my friend and it was a blast. We landed 5 musky in the two days and lost 6. Had more hits and follows then I can remember.  Both of us got a fish on figure 8’s and all we do are cast. We got 2, 40” musky and 3, 50’+. We also both got our PB. Enough reading here are some pictures.  40”       The 50” +        "

807270,spinnerdoc,2013-09-11 09:59:00,556,Easy buddy don't break your back with that musky. Lift with yourback straight and bend the legs lol. Those lsc musky are beautiful.  Is that strain specific to lsc?
