Went to LS with my neighbour Bob while he can still sit comfortably in a boat  (surgery next week), and one outing by myself to a lake in town at the crack of dawn.  Both went well, lots of big fish both outings.  Fish were at the 22' - 30' FOW range on both lakes, the fish on LS in particular showing signs of the fall feedbag football shape.  Jigs and minnows....BIG MINNOWS.  Both days windy......water temps have dropped 15 degrees in as many days.  We caught a few Bass at LS....they too were deep.   LAC SEUL      THUNDER              SOME PICS FROM BOTH OUTINGS                                                                           "
