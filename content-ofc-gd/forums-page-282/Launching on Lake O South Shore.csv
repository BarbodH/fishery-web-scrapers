807805,TerryC,2013-09-14 21:11:00,196,"Hi.  Looking for a little info. I am hoping to launch on the south shore of lake O tomorrow morning, probably around Grimsby. The weather is calling for S/W winds at 15 kms. I think it should be nice on this side. Am I correct? Any info would help.  Cheers  Terry"

You really never know this time of year until you get out there, and then it can change before you get out of the channel. 50 Point Conservation Park Marina is another great choice. Both are in central and prime spots with good large launches. Price? Not sure."
807814,Fish Farmer,2013-09-15 01:40:00,2234,"$23.00 to launch at 50 PT  and you can't get in before 6am, I think $12.00 at Forans"
